atahualpa, t, w, l, p, also, atawallpa, quechua, atabalica, atahuallpa, atabalipa, c, 1502, july, 1533, was, the, last, effective, inca, emperor, before, his, capture, and, execution, during, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, inca, empire, atahualpa, was, the, son, of, the, emperor, huayna, c, pac, who, died, around, 1525, along, with, his, successor, ninan, cuyochi, in, a, smallpox, epidemic, atahualpa, initially, accepted, his, half, brother, hu, scar, as, the, new, emperor, who, in, turn, appointed, him, as, governor, of, quito, in, the, north, of, the, empire, the, uneasy, peace, between, them, deteriorated, over, the, next, few, years, from, 1529, to, 1532, they, contested, the, succession, in, the, inca, civil, war, in, which, atahualpa, s, forces, defeated, and, captured, hu, scar, around, the, same, time, as, atahualpa, s, victory, a, group, of, spanish, conquistadors, led, by, francisco, pizarro, arrived, in, the, region, in, november, 1532, they, captured, atahualpa, during, an, ambush, at, cajamarca, in, captivity, atahualpa, gave, a, ransom, in, exchange, for, a, promise, of, release, and, arranged, for, the, execution, of, hu, scar, after, receiving, the, ransom, the, spanish, accused, atahualpa, of, treason, conspiracy, against, the, spanish, crown, and, the, murder, of, hu, scar, they, put, him, on, trial, and, sentenced, him, to, death, by, burning, at, the, stake, however, after, his, baptism, in, july, 1533, he, was, garroted, instead, a, line, of, successors, continued, to, claim, the, title, of, emperor, either, as, spanish, vassals, or, as, rebel, leaders, but, none, were, able, to, hold, comparable, power, although, this, monarch, s, name, is, written, with, some, major, discrepancies, in, early, sources, most, spellings, seem, to, reflect, atawa, pa, which, in, contemporary, quechua, orthography, is, written, atawallpa, as, such, atabalica, and, tavalipa, may, have, been, misspellings, since, the, earliest, quechua, dictionaries, atawallpa, and, wallpa, were, offered, as, the, quechua, word, for, chicken, for, centuries, several, historians, believed, that, this, sapa, inca, s, name, came, from, the, bird, name, some, even, translated, the, name, as, happy, rooster, or, bird, of, fortune, considering, such, species, was, new, in, the, andes, contemporary, scholars, believe, the, etymological, direction, was, the, inverse, the, bird, species, may, have, been, named, after, the, monarch, as, already, said, by, blas, valera, in, the, xvith, century, it, has, been, proposed, that, this, person, name, may, have, been, a, compound, of, two, puquina, roots, ata, appointed, chosen, and, wallpa, diligent, or, courageous, however, this, analysis, is, not, consensual, there, are, uncertainties, about, atahualpa, s, date, and, place, of, birth, he, was, likely, born, around, the, turn, of, the, 16th, century, c, 1502, there, is, disagreement, on, his, place, of, birth, below, are, the, versions, of, some, chroniclers, and, historians, the, chronicler, and, soldier, pedro, cieza, de, le, n, from, his, investigations, among, the, members, of, the, inca, nobility, of, cusco, affirmed, that, atahualpa, had, been, born, in, cusco, and, that, his, mother, was, tuto, palla, or, t, pac, palla, quechua, names, an, india, quilaco, or, native, of, quilaco, this, demonym, could, allude, to, an, ethnic, group, from, the, province, of, quito, and, would, imply, that, she, was, a, second, class, wife, belonging, to, the, regional, elite, cieza, de, le, n, denied, that, atahualpa, was, born, in, quito, or, caranqui, and, that, his, mother, was, the, lady, of, quito, as, some, at, the, time, claimed, since, quito, was, a, province, of, tahuantinsuyo, when, atahualpa, was, born, therefore, their, kings, and, lords, were, the, incas, according, to, juan, de, betanzos, atahualpa, was, born, in, cusco, and, his, mother, was, a, usta, inca, princess, from, cusco, of, the, lineage, of, inga, yupangue, pachacuti, in, the, 18th, century, the, priest, juan, de, velasco, using, as, a, source, a, work, by, marcos, de, niza, whose, existence, has, not, been, confirmed, compiled, information, about, the, kingdom, of, quito, whose, existence, has, not, been, confirmed, either, according, to, de, velasco, the, kingdom, of, quito, was, made, up, of, the, shyris, or, scyris, ethnic, group, and, disappeared, when, it, was, conquered, by, the, incas, this, work, includes, a, list, of, the, kings, of, quito, the, last, of, whom, cacha, duchicela, would, have, been, the, kuraka, inca, cacique, defeated, and, killed, by, the, inca, huayna, c, pac, paccha, the, daughter, of, cacha, duchicela, would, have, married, huayna, c, pac, and, from, that, union, atahualpa, would, have, been, born, as, a, legitimate, son, several, historians, such, as, the, peruvian, ra, l, porras, barrenechea, and, the, ecuadorian, jacinto, jij, n, y, caama, o, have, rejected, this, version, for, lack, of, historical, and, archaeological, foundation, most, peruvian, historians, maintain, that, according, to, the, most, reliable, chronicles, cieza, sarmiento, and, betanzos, who, took, their, reports, firsthand, atahualpa, was, born, in, cusco, and, his, mother, was, a, princess, of, inca, lineage, these, historians, consider, that, hu, scar, s, side, invented, the, version, of, atahualpa, s, quito, origin, to, show, him, to, the, spanish, as, a, usurper, and, bastard, they, also, believe, that, many, chroniclers, interpreted, the, division, of, the, empire, between, the, two, sons, of, huayna, c, pac, hu, scar, the, eldest, son, and, legitimate, heir, and, atahualpa, the, bastard, and, usurper, according, to, their, european, or, western, conception, of, political, mores, according, to, rostworowski, this, is, wrong, because, the, right, to, the, inca, throne, did, not, depend, exclusively, on, primogeniture, or, paternal, line, because, the, son, of, the, inca, s, sister, could, also, be, heir, but, also, practical, considerations, such, as, the, ability, to, command, ecuadorian, historians, have, conflicting, opinions, atahualpa, spent, his, childhood, with, his, father, in, cusco, at, the, beginning, of, his, adolescence, he, went, through, the, warachikuy, a, rite, of, passage, that, marked, the, passage, to, adulthood, when, atahualpa, was, thirteen, years, old, there, was, a, rebellion, in, the, north, of, the, empire, by, two, peoples, from, that, region, the, caranquis, and, the, cayambis, together, with, his, father, and, his, brother, ninan, cuyuchi, marched, at, the, head, of, the, inca, army, towards, the, northern, provinces, quito, region, four, governors, remained, in, cusco, including, hu, scar, atahualpa, stayed, in, quito, with, his, father, for, more, than, ten, years, helping, him, put, down, rebellions, and, conquer, new, lands, for, this, he, had, the, support, of, skilled, inca, generals, such, as, chalcuch, mac, and, quizquiz, during, this, period, he, learned, government, tasks, and, gained, prestige, for, the, courage, he, displayed, in, war, actions, the, chroniclers, described, atahualpa, as, someone, of, lively, reasoning, and, with, great, authority, throughout, the, inca, empire, s, history, each, sapa, inca, worked, to, expand, the, territory, of, the, empire, when, pachacuti, the, 9th, sapa, inca, ruled, he, expanded, the, empire, to, northern, peru, at, this, point, pachacuti, sent, his, son, tupac, inca, yupanqui, to, invade, and, conquer, the, territory, of, present, day, ecuador, news, of, the, expansion, of, the, inca, reached, the, different, tribes, and, nations, of, ecuador, as, a, defense, against, the, inca, the, andean, chiefdoms, formed, alliances, with, each, other, around, 1460, tupac, inca, yupanqui, with, an, army, of, 200, 000, warriors, that, were, sent, by, his, father, easily, gained, control, of, the, palta, nation, in, southern, ecuador, and, northern, peru, in, a, matter, of, months, however, the, inca, army, met, fierce, resistance, from, the, defending, ca, ari, which, left, the, incas, so, impressed, that, after, they, were, defeated, the, ca, ari, were, recruited, into, the, inca, army, in, northern, ecuador, the, inca, army, met, fiercer, resistance, from, an, alliance, between, the, quitus, and, the, ca, ari, after, defeating, them, in, the, battle, of, atuntaqui, tupac, yupanqui, sent, settlers, to, what, is, now, the, city, of, quito, and, left, as, governor, chalco, mayta, belonging, to, the, inca, nobility, around, 1520, the, tribes, of, quitu, caras, and, puruh, rebelled, against, the, inca, huayna, c, pac, he, personally, led, his, army, and, defeated, the, rebels, in, the, battle, of, laguna, de, yahuarcocha, where, there, was, such, a, massacre, that, the, lake, turned, to, blood, according, to, juan, de, velasco, the, alliance, of, the, northern, tribes, collapsed, and, finally, ended, when, huayna, c, pac, married, paccha, duchicela, queen, of, the, shyris, making, them, recognize, him, as, monarch, this, marriage, was, the, basis, of, the, alliance, that, guaranteed, the, inca, power, in, the, area, after, huayna, capac, died, in, 1527, atahualpa, was, appointed, governor, of, quito, by, his, brother, hu, scar, hu, scar, saw, atahualpa, as, the, greatest, threat, to, his, power, but, did, not, dethrone, him, to, respect, the, wishes, of, his, late, father, a, tense, five, year, peace, ensued, hu, scar, took, advantage, of, that, time, to, get, the, support, of, the, ca, ari, a, powerful, ethnic, group, that, dominated, extensive, territories, of, the, north, of, the, empire, and, maintained, grudges, against, atahualpa, who, had, fought, them, during, his, father, s, campaigns, by, 1529, the, relationship, between, both, brothers, had, quite, deteriorated, according, to, the, chronicler, pedro, pizarro, hu, scar, sent, an, army, to, the, north, which, ambushed, atahualpa, in, tumebamba, and, defeated, him, atahualpa, was, captured, and, imprisoned, in, a, tambo, roadside, shelters, built, for, the, chasqui, but, succeeded, in, escaping, during, his, time, in, captivity, he, was, cut, and, lost, an, ear, from, then, on, he, wore, a, headpiece, that, fastened, under, his, chin, to, hide, the, injury, but, the, chronicler, miguel, cabello, de, balboa, said, that, this, story, of, capture, was, improbable, because, if, atahualpa, had, been, captured, by, hu, scar, s, forces, they, would, have, executed, him, immediately, atahualpa, returned, to, quito, and, amassed, a, great, army, he, attacked, the, ca, ari, of, tumebamba, defeating, its, defenses, and, levelling, the, city, and, the, surrounding, lands, he, arrived, in, tumbes, from, which, he, planned, an, assault, by, rafts, on, the, island, pun, during, the, naval, operation, atahualpa, sustained, a, leg, injury, and, returned, to, land, taking, advantage, of, his, retreat, the, punane, os, inhabitants, of, pu, a, attacked, tumbes, they, destroyed, the, city, leaving, it, in, the, ruined, state, recorded, by, the, spaniards, in, early, 1532, from, cuzco, the, huascarites, led, by, the, armies, of, general, atoc, defeated, atahualpa, in, the, battle, of, chillopampa, the, atahualapite, generals, responded, quickly, they, gathered, together, their, scattered, troops, counter, attacked, and, forcefully, defeated, atoc, in, mulliambato, they, captured, atoc, and, later, tortured, and, killed, him, the, atahualapite, forces, continued, to, be, victorious, as, a, result, of, the, strategic, abilities, of, quizquiz, and, chalcuch, mac, atahualpa, began, a, slow, advance, on, cuzco, while, based, in, marcahuamachuco, he, sent, an, emissary, to, consult, the, oracle, of, the, huaca, god, catequil, who, prophesied, that, atahualpa, s, advance, would, end, poorly, furious, at, the, prophecy, atahualpa, went, to, the, sanctuary, killed, the, priest, and, ordered, the, temple, to, be, destroyed, during, this, period, he, first, learned, that, pizarro, and, his, expedition, had, arrived, in, the, empire, atahualpa, s, leading, generals, were, quizquiz, chalcuch, mac, and, rumi, awi, in, april, 1532, quizquiz, and, his, companions, led, the, armies, of, atahualpa, to, victory, in, the, battles, of, mullihambato, chimborazo, and, quipaip, n, the, battle, of, quipaip, n, was, the, final, one, between, the, warring, brothers, quizquiz, and, chalcuchimac, defeated, hu, scar, s, army, captured, him, killed, his, family, and, seized, the, capital, cuzco, atahualpa, had, remained, behind, in, the, andean, city, of, cajamarca, where, he, encountered, the, spanish, led, by, pizarro, in, january, 1531, a, spanish, expedition, led, by, francisco, pizarro, on, a, mission, to, conquer, the, inca, empire, landed, on, pun, island, pizarro, brought, with, him, 169, men, and, 69, horses, the, spaniards, headed, south, and, occupied, tumbes, where, they, heard, about, the, civil, war, that, hu, scar, and, atahualpa, were, waging, against, each, other, about, a, year, and, a, half, later, in, september, 1532, after, reinforcements, had, arrived, from, spain, pizarro, founded, the, city, of, san, miguel, de, piura, and, then, marched, towards, the, heart, of, the, inca, empire, with, a, force, of, 106, foot, soldiers, and, 62, horsemen, atahualpa, in, cajamarca, with, his, army, of, 80, 000, troops, heard, that, this, party, of, strangers, was, advancing, into, the, empire, and, sent, an, inca, noble, to, investigate, the, noble, stayed, for, two, days, in, the, spanish, camp, making, an, assessment, of, the, spaniards, weapons, and, horses, atahualpa, decided, that, the, 168, spaniards, were, not, a, threat, to, him, and, his, 80, 000, troops, so, he, sent, word, inviting, them, to, visit, cajamarca, and, meet, him, expecting, to, capture, them, pizarro, and, his, men, thus, advanced, unopposed, through, some, very, difficult, terrain, they, arrived, at, cajamarca, on, 15, november, 1532, atahualpa, and, his, army, had, camped, on, a, hill, just, outside, cajamarca, he, was, staying, in, a, building, close, to, the, konoj, hot, springs, while, his, soldiers, were, in, tents, set, up, around, him, when, pizarro, arrived, in, cajamarca, the, town, was, mostly, empty, except, for, a, few, hundred, acllas, the, spaniards, were, billeted, in, certain, long, buildings, on, the, main, square, and, pizarro, sent, an, embassy, to, the, inca, led, by, hernando, de, soto, the, group, consisted, of, 15, horsemen, and, an, interpreter, shortly, thereafter, de, soto, sent, 20, more, horsemen, as, reinforcements, in, case, of, an, inca, attack, these, were, led, by, francisco, pizarro, s, brother, hernando, pizarro, the, spaniards, invited, atahualpa, to, visit, cajamarca, to, meet, pizarro, which, he, resolved, to, do, the, following, day, meanwhile, pizarro, was, preparing, an, ambush, to, trap, the, inca, while, the, spanish, cavalry, and, infantry, were, occupying, three, long, buildings, around, the, square, some, musketeers, and, four, pieces, of, artillery, were, located, in, a, stone, structure, in, the, middle, of, the, square, the, plan, was, to, persuade, atahualpa, to, submit, to, the, authority, of, the, spaniards, and, if, this, failed, there, were, two, options, a, surprise, attack, if, success, seemed, possible, or, to, keep, up, a, friendly, stance, if, the, inca, forces, appeared, too, powerful, the, following, day, atahualpa, left, his, camp, at, midday, preceded, by, a, large, number, of, men, in, ceremonial, attire, as, the, procession, advanced, slowly, pizarro, sent, his, brother, hernando, to, invite, the, inca, to, enter, cajamarca, before, nightfall, atahualpa, entered, the, town, late, in, the, afternoon, in, a, litter, carried, by, eighty, lords, with, him, were, four, other, lords, in, litters, and, hammocks, and, 5, 000, 6, 000, men, carrying, small, battle, axes, slings, and, pouches, of, stones, underneath, their, clothes, he, was, very, drunk, from, what, he, had, imbibed, in, the, thermal, baths, before, leaving, as, well, as, what, he, had, taken, during, the, many, stops, on, the, road, in, each, of, them, he, had, drunk, well, and, even, there, on, his, litter, he, requested, drink, the, inca, found, no, spaniards, in, the, plaza, as, they, were, all, inside, the, buildings, the, only, man, to, emerge, was, the, dominican, friar, vincente, de, valverde, with, an, interpreter, although, there, are, different, accounts, as, to, what, valverde, said, most, agree, that, he, invited, the, inca, to, come, inside, to, talk, and, dine, with, pizarro, atahualpa, instead, demanded, the, return, of, every, thing, the, spaniards, had, taken, since, they, landed, according, to, eyewitness, accounts, valverde, spoke, about, the, catholic, religion, but, did, not, deliver, the, requerimiento, a, speech, requiring, the, listener, to, submit, to, the, authority, of, the, spanish, crown, and, accept, the, christian, faith, at, atahualpa, s, request, valverde, gave, him, his, breviary, but, after, a, brief, examination, the, inca, threw, it, to, the, ground, valverde, hurried, back, toward, pizarro, calling, on, the, spaniards, to, attack, at, that, moment, pizarro, gave, the, signal, the, spanish, infantry, and, cavalry, came, out, of, their, hiding, places, and, charged, the, unsuspecting, inca, retinue, killing, a, great, number, while, the, rest, fled, in, panic, pizarro, led, the, charge, on, atahualpa, but, captured, him, only, after, killing, all, those, carrying, him, and, turning, over, his, litter, not, a, single, spanish, soldier, was, killed, on, 17, november, the, spaniards, sacked, the, inca, army, camp, in, which, they, found, great, treasures, of, gold, silver, and, emeralds, noticing, their, lust, for, precious, metals, atahualpa, offered, to, fill, a, large, room, about, 6, 7, m, 22, ft, long, and, 5, 2, m, 17, ft, wide, up, to, a, height, of, 2, 4, m, 8, ft, once, with, gold, and, twice, with, silver, within, two, months, it, is, commonly, believed, that, atahualpa, offered, this, ransom, to, regain, his, freedom, but, hemming, says, that, he, did, so, to, save, his, life, none, of, the, early, chroniclers, mention, any, commitment, by, the, spaniards, to, free, atahualpa, once, the, metals, were, delivered, after, several, months, in, fear, of, an, imminent, attack, from, general, rumi, awi, the, outnumbered, spanish, considered, atahualpa, to, be, too, much, of, a, liability, and, decided, to, execute, him, pizarro, staged, a, mock, trial, and, found, atahualpa, guilty, of, revolting, against, the, spanish, practicing, idolatry, and, murdering, hu, scar, his, brother, atahualpa, was, sentenced, to, death, by, burning, at, the, stake, he, was, horrified, since, the, inca, believed, that, the, soul, would, not, be, able, to, go, on, to, the, afterlife, if, the, body, were, burned, friar, vincente, de, valverde, who, had, earlier, offered, his, breviary, to, atahualpa, intervened, telling, atahualpa, that, if, he, agreed, to, convert, to, catholicism, the, friar, could, convince, pizarro, to, commute, the, sentence, atahualpa, agreed, to, be, baptized, into, the, catholic, faith, he, was, given, the, name, francisco, atahualpa, in, honor, of, francisco, pizarro, on, the, morning, of, his, death, atahualpa, was, interrogated, by, his, spanish, captors, about, his, birthplace, atahualpa, declared, that, his, birthplace, was, in, what, the, incas, called, the, kingdom, of, quito, in, a, place, called, caranqui, today, located, 2, km, southeast, of, ibarra, ecuador, most, chroniclers, agree, though, other, stories, suggest, various, other, birthplaces, in, accordance, with, his, request, he, was, executed, by, strangling, with, a, garrote, on, 26, july, 1533, his, clothes, and, some, of, his, skin, were, burned, and, his, remains, were, given, a, christian, burial, atahualpa, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, t, pac, huallpa, and, later, by, another, brother, manco, inca, after, the, death, of, pizarro, in, s, yupanqui, atahualpa, s, favorite, sister, who, had, been, given, to, pizarro, in, marriage, by, her, brother, married, a, spanish, knight, named, ampuero, and, left, for, spain, they, took, her, daughter, by, pizarro, with, them, and, she, was, later,
