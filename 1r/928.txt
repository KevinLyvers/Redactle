saint, george, greek, translit, ge, rgios, died, 23, april, 303, also, george, of, lydda, was, an, early, christian, martyr, who, is, venerated, as, a, saint, in, christianity, according, to, tradition, he, was, a, soldier, in, the, roman, army, of, cappadocian, greek, origin, he, became, a, member, of, the, praetorian, guard, for, roman, emperor, diocletian, but, was, sentenced, to, death, for, refusing, to, recant, his, christian, faith, he, became, one, of, the, most, venerated, saints, heroes, and, megalomartyrs, in, christianity, and, he, has, been, especially, venerated, as, a, military, saint, since, the, crusades, he, is, respected, by, christians, druze, as, well, as, some, muslims, as, a, martyr, of, monotheistic, faith, in, hagiography, as, one, of, the, fourteen, holy, helpers, and, one, of, the, most, prominent, military, saints, he, is, immortalized, in, the, legend, of, saint, george, and, the, dragon, his, feast, day, saint, george, s, day, is, traditionally, celebrated, on, 23, april, historically, the, countries, of, england, bosnia, and, herzegovina, bulgaria, georgia, ukraine, malta, ethiopia, the, regions, of, catalonia, and, aragon, and, the, city, of, moscow, have, claimed, george, as, their, patron, saint, as, have, several, other, regions, cities, universities, professions, and, organizations, the, church, of, saint, george, in, lod, lydda, israel, has, a, sarcophagus, traditionally, believed, to, contain, st, george, s, remains, very, little, is, known, about, george, s, life, it, is, thought, that, he, was, a, roman, military, officer, of, cappadocian, greek, descent, who, was, martyred, under, roman, emperor, diocletian, in, one, of, the, pre, constantinian, persecutions, of, the, 3rd, or, early, 4th, century, beyond, this, early, sources, give, conflicting, information, edward, gibbon, argued, that, george, or, at, least, the, legend, from, which, the, above, is, distilled, is, based, on, george, of, cappadocia, a, notorious, 4th, century, arian, bishop, who, was, athanasius, of, alexandria, s, most, bitter, rival, and, that, it, was, he, who, in, time, became, george, of, england, this, identification, is, seen, as, highly, improbable, bishop, george, was, slain, by, gentile, greeks, for, exacting, onerous, taxes, especially, inheritance, taxes, j, b, bury, who, edited, the, 1906, edition, of, gibbon, s, the, decline, and, fall, wrote, this, theory, of, gibbon, s, has, nothing, to, be, said, for, it, he, adds, that, the, connection, of, st, george, with, a, dragon, slaying, legend, does, not, relegate, him, to, the, region, of, the, myth, saint, george, in, all, likelihood, was, martyred, before, the, year, 290, there, is, little, information, on, the, early, life, of, george, herbert, thurston, in, the, catholic, encyclopedia, states, that, based, upon, an, ancient, cultus, narratives, of, the, early, pilgrims, and, the, early, dedications, of, churches, to, george, going, back, to, the, fourth, century, there, seems, therefore, no, ground, for, doubting, the, historical, existence, of, st, george, although, no, faith, can, be, placed, in, either, the, details, of, his, history, or, his, alleged, exploits, the, diocletianic, persecution, of, 303, associated, with, military, saints, because, the, persecution, was, aimed, at, christians, among, the, professional, soldiers, of, the, roman, army, is, of, undisputed, historicity, according, to, donald, attwater, no, historical, particulars, of, his, life, have, survived, the, widespread, veneration, for, st, george, as, a, soldier, saint, from, early, times, had, its, centre, in, palestine, at, diospolis, now, lydda, st, george, was, apparently, martyred, there, at, the, end, of, the, third, or, the, beginning, of, the, fourth, century, that, is, all, that, can, be, reasonably, surmised, about, him, the, saint, s, veneration, dates, to, the, 5th, century, with, some, certainty, and, possibly, even, to, the, 4th, while, the, collection, of, his, miracles, gradually, began, during, the, medieval, times, the, story, of, the, defeat, of, the, dragon, is, not, part, of, saint, george, s, earliest, hagiographies, and, seems, to, have, been, a, later, addition, the, earliest, text, which, preserves, fragments, of, george, s, narrative, is, in, a, greek, hagiography, which, is, identified, by, hippolyte, delehaye, of, the, scholarly, bollandists, to, be, a, palimpsest, of, the, 5th, century, an, earlier, work, by, eusebius, church, history, written, in, the, 4th, century, contributed, to, the, legend, but, did, not, name, george, or, provide, significant, detail, the, work, of, the, bollandists, daniel, papebroch, jean, bolland, and, godfrey, henschen, in, the, 17th, century, was, one, of, the, first, pieces, of, scholarly, research, to, establish, the, saint, s, historicity, via, their, publications, in, bibliotheca, hagiographica, graeca, pope, gelasius, i, stated, in, 494, that, george, was, among, those, saints, whose, names, are, justly, reverenced, among, men, but, whose, actions, are, known, only, to, god, the, most, complete, version, based, upon, the, fifth, century, greek, text, but, in, a, later, form, survives, in, a, translation, into, syriac, from, about, 600, from, text, fragments, preserved, in, the, british, library, a, translation, into, english, was, published, in, 1925, in, the, greek, tradition, george, was, born, to, noble, christian, parents, in, cappadocia, after, his, father, died, his, mother, who, was, originally, from, lydda, in, syria, palaestina, a, part, of, the, byzantine, empire, returned, with, george, to, her, hometown, he, went, on, to, become, a, soldier, for, the, roman, army, but, because, of, his, christian, faith, he, was, arrested, and, tortured, at, or, near, lydda, also, called, diospolis, on, the, following, day, he, was, paraded, and, then, beheaded, and, his, body, was, buried, in, lydda, according, to, other, sources, after, his, mother, s, death, george, travelled, to, the, eastern, imperial, capital, nicomedia, where, he, was, persecuted, by, one, dadianus, in, later, versions, of, the, greek, legend, this, name, is, rationalised, to, diocletian, and, george, s, martyrdom, is, placed, in, the, diocletian, persecution, of, ad, 303, the, setting, in, nicomedia, is, also, secondary, and, inconsistent, with, the, earliest, cults, of, the, saint, being, located, in, diospolis, george, was, executed, by, decapitation, on, 23, april, 303, a, witness, of, his, suffering, convinced, empress, alexandra, of, rome, to, become, a, christian, as, well, so, she, joined, george, in, martyrdom, his, body, was, buried, in, lydda, where, christians, soon, came, to, honour, him, as, a, martyr, the, latin, passio, sancti, georgii, 6th, century, follows, the, general, course, of, the, greek, legend, but, diocletian, here, becomes, dacian, emperor, of, the, persians, his, martyrdom, was, greatly, extended, to, more, than, twenty, separate, tortures, over, the, course, of, seven, years, over, the, course, of, his, martyrdom, 40, 900, pagans, were, converted, to, christianity, including, the, empress, alexandra, when, george, finally, died, the, wicked, dacian, was, carried, away, in, a, whirlwind, of, fire, in, later, latin, versions, the, persecutor, is, the, roman, emperor, decius, or, a, roman, judge, named, dacian, serving, under, diocletian, the, earliest, known, record, of, the, legend, of, saint, george, and, the, dragon, occurs, in, the, 11th, century, in, a, georgian, source, reaching, catholic, europe, in, the, 12th, century, in, the, golden, legend, by, 13th, century, archbishop, of, genoa, jacobus, de, voragine, george, s, death, was, at, the, hands, of, dacian, and, about, the, year, 287, the, tradition, tells, that, a, fierce, dragon, was, causing, panic, at, the, city, of, silene, libya, at, the, time, george, arrived, there, in, order, to, prevent, the, dragon, from, devastating, people, from, the, city, they, gave, two, sheep, each, day, to, the, dragon, but, when, the, sheep, were, not, enough, they, were, forced, to, sacrifice, humans, elected, by, the, city, s, own, people, instead, of, the, two, sheep, eventually, the, king, s, daughter, was, chosen, to, be, sacrificed, and, no, one, was, willing, to, take, her, place, george, saved, the, girl, by, slaying, the, dragon, with, a, lance, the, king, was, so, grateful, that, he, offered, him, treasures, as, a, reward, for, saving, his, daughter, s, life, but, george, refused, it, and, instead, he, gave, these, to, the, poor, the, people, of, the, city, were, so, amazed, at, what, they, had, witnessed, that, they, became, christians, and, were, all, baptized, saint, george, s, encounter, with, a, dragon, as, narrated, in, the, golden, legend, would, go, on, to, become, very, influential, as, it, remains, the, most, familiar, version, in, english, owing, to, william, caxton, s, 15th, century, translation, in, the, medieval, romances, the, lance, with, which, george, slew, the, dragon, was, called, ascalon, after, the, levantine, city, of, ashkelon, today, in, israel, the, name, ascalon, was, used, by, winston, churchill, for, his, personal, aircraft, during, world, war, ii, according, to, records, at, bletchley, park, iconography, of, the, horseman, with, spear, overcoming, evil, was, widespread, throughout, the, christian, period, george, arabic, jirjis, or, girgus, is, included, in, some, muslim, texts, as, a, prophetic, figure, the, islamic, sources, state, that, he, lived, among, a, group, of, believers, who, were, in, direct, contact, with, the, last, apostles, of, jesus, he, is, described, as, a, rich, merchant, who, opposed, erection, of, apollo, s, statue, by, mosul, s, king, dadan, after, confronting, the, king, george, was, tortured, many, times, to, no, effect, was, imprisoned, and, was, aided, by, the, angels, eventually, he, exposed, that, the, idols, were, possessed, by, satan, but, was, martyred, when, the, city, was, destroyed, by, god, in, a, rain, of, fire, muslim, scholars, had, tried, to, find, a, historical, connection, of, the, saint, due, to, his, popularity, according, to, muslim, legend, he, was, martyred, under, the, rule, of, diocletian, and, was, killed, three, times, but, resurrected, every, time, the, legend, is, more, developed, in, the, persian, version, of, al, tabari, wherein, he, resurrects, the, dead, makes, trees, sprout, and, pillars, bear, flowers, after, one, of, his, deaths, the, world, is, covered, by, darkness, which, is, lifted, only, when, he, is, resurrected, he, is, able, to, convert, the, queen, but, she, is, put, to, death, he, then, prays, to, god, to, allow, him, to, die, which, is, granted, al, tha, labi, states, that, he, was, from, palestine, and, lived, in, the, times, of, some, disciples, of, jesus, he, was, killed, many, times, by, the, king, of, mosul, and, resurrected, each, time, when, the, king, tried, to, starve, him, he, touched, a, piece, of, dry, wood, brought, by, a, woman, and, turned, it, green, with, varieties, of, fruits, and, vegetables, growing, from, it, after, his, fourth, death, the, city, was, burnt, along, with, him, ibn, al, athir, s, account, of, one, of, his, deaths, is, parallel, to, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, stating, when, he, died, god, sent, stormy, winds, and, thunder, and, lightning, and, dark, clouds, so, that, darkness, fell, between, heaven, and, earth, and, people, were, in, great, wonderment, the, account, adds, that, the, darkness, was, lifted, after, his, resurrection, a, titular, church, built, in, lydda, during, the, reign, of, constantine, the, great, reigned, 306, 337, was, consecrated, to, a, man, of, the, highest, distinction, according, to, the, church, history, of, eusebius, the, name, of, the, titulus, patron, was, not, indicated, the, church, of, saint, george, and, mosque, of, al, khadr, located, in, the, city, is, believed, to, have, housed, his, remains, the, veneration, of, george, spread, from, syria, palaestina, through, lebanon, to, the, rest, of, the, byzantine, empire, though, the, martyr, is, not, mentioned, in, the, syriac, breviarium, and, the, region, east, of, the, black, sea, by, the, 5th, century, the, veneration, of, george, had, reached, the, christian, western, roman, empire, as, well, in, 494, george, was, canonized, as, a, saint, by, pope, gelasius, i, among, those, which, are, known, better, to, god, than, to, human, beings, the, early, cult, of, the, saint, was, localized, in, diospolis, lydda, in, palestine, the, first, description, of, lydda, as, a, pilgrimage, site, where, george, s, relics, were, venerated, is, de, situ, terrae, sanctae, by, the, archdeacon, theodosius, written, between, 518, and, 530, by, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, the, center, of, his, veneration, appears, to, have, shifted, to, cappadocia, the, life, of, saint, theodore, of, sykeon, written, in, the, 7th, century, mentions, the, veneration, of, the, relics, of, the, saint, in, cappadocia, by, the, time, of, the, early, muslim, conquests, of, the, mostly, christian, and, zoroastrian, middle, east, a, basilica, in, lydda, dedicated, to, george, existed, a, new, church, was, erected, in, 1872, and, is, still, standing, where, the, feast, of, the, translation, of, the, relics, of, saint, george, to, that, location, is, celebrated, on, 3, november, each, year, in, england, he, was, mentioned, among, the, martyrs, by, the, 8th, century, monk, bede, the, georgslied, is, an, adaptation, of, his, legend, in, old, high, german, composed, in, the, late, 9th, century, the, earliest, dedication, to, the, saint, in, england, is, a, church, at, fordington, dorset, that, is, mentioned, in, the, will, of, alfred, the, great, george, did, not, rise, to, the, position, of, patron, saint, of, england, however, until, the, 14th, century, and, he, was, still, obscured, by, edward, the, confessor, the, traditional, patron, saint, of, england, until, in, 1552, during, the, reign, of, edward, vi, all, saints, banners, other, than, george, s, were, abolished, in, the, english, reformation, belief, in, an, apparition, of, george, heartened, the, franks, at, the, battle, of, antioch, in, 1098, and, a, similar, appearance, occurred, the, following, year, at, jerusalem, the, chivalric, military, order, of, sant, jordi, d, alfama, was, established, by, king, peter, the, catholic, from, the, crown, of, aragon, in, 1201, republic, of, genoa, kingdom, of, hungary, 1326, and, by, frederick, iii, holy, roman, emperor, edward, iii, of, england, put, his, order, of, the, garter, under, the, banner, of, george, probably, in, 1348, the, chronicler, jean, froissart, observed, the, english, invoking, george, as, a, battle, cry, on, several, occasions, during, the, hundred, years, war, in, his, rise, as, a, national, saint, george, was, aided, by, the, very, fact, that, the, saint, had, no, legendary, connection, with, england, and, no, specifically, localised, shrine, as, that, of, thomas, becket, at, canterbury, consequently, numerous, shrines, were, established, during, the, late, fifteenth, century, muriel, c, mcclendon, has, written, and, his, did, not, become, closely, identified, with, a, particular, occupation, or, with, the, cure, of, a, specific, malady, in, the, wake, of, the, crusades, george, became, a, model, of, chivalry, in, works, of, literature, including, medieval, romances, in, the, 13th, century, jacobus, de, voragine, archbishop, of, genoa, compiled, the, legenda, sanctorum, readings, of, the, saints, also, known, as, legenda, aurea, the, golden, legend, its, 177, chapters, 182, in, some, editions, include, the, story, of, george, among, many, others, after, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, the, book, became, a, best, seller, the, establishment, of, george, as, a, popular, saint, and, protective, giant, in, the, west, that, had, captured, the, medieval, imagination, was, codified, by, the, official, elevation, of, his, feast, to, a, festum, duplex, at, a, church, council, in, 1415, on, the, date, that, had, become, associated, with, his, martyrdom, 23, april, there, was, wide, latitude, from, community, to, community, in, celebration, of, the, day, across, late, medieval, and, early, modern, england, and, no, uniform, national, celebration, elsewhere, a, token, of, the, popular, and, vernacular, nature, of, george, s, cultus, and, its, local, horizons, supported, by, a, local, guild, or, confraternity, under, george, s, protection, or, the, dedication, of, a, local, church, when, the, english, reformation, severely, curtailed, the, saints, days, in, the, calendar, saint, george, s, day, was, among, the, holidays, that, continued, to, be, observed, in, april, 2019, the, parish, church, of, s, o, jorge, in, s, o, jorge, madeira, island, portugal, solemnly, received, the, relics, of, george, patron, saint, of, the, parish, during, the, celebrations, the, 504th, anniversary, of, its, foundation, the, relics, were, brought, by, the, new, bishop, of, funchal, d, nuno, br, s, george, is, renowned, throughout, the, middle, east, as, both, saint, and, prophet, his, veneration, by, christians, and, muslims, lies, in, his, composite, personality, combining, several, biblical, quranic, and, other, ancient, mythical, heroes, saint, george, is, the, patron, saint, of, lebanese, christians, christians, in, israel, and, palestine, and, syrian, christians, william, dalrymple, who, reviewed, the, literature, in, 1999, tells, us, that, j, e, hanauer, in, his, 1907, book, folklore, of, the, holy, land, muslim, christian, and, jewish, mentioned, a, shrine, in, the, village, of, beit, jala, beside, bethlehem, which, at, the, time, was, frequented, by, christians, who, regarded, it, as, the, birthplace, of, george, and, some, jews, who, regarded, it, as, the, burial, place, of, the, prophet, elias, according, to, hanauer, in, his, day, the, monastery, was, a, sort, of, madhouse, deranged, persons, of, all, the, three, faiths, are, taken, thither, and, chained, in, the, court, of, the, chapel, where, they, are, kept, for, forty, days, on, bread, and, water, the, eastern, orthodox, priest, at, the, head, of, the, establishment, now, and, then, reading, the, gospel, over, them, or, administering, a, whipping, as, the, case, demands, in, the, 1920s, according, to, tawfiq, canaan, s, mohammedan, saints, and, sanctuaries, in, palestine, nothing, seemed, to, have, changed, and, all, three, communities, were, still, visiting, the, shrine, and, praying, together, dalrymple, himself, visited, the, place, in, 1995, i, asked, around, in, the, christian, quarter, in, jerusalem, and, discovered, that, the, place, was, very, much, alive, with, all, the, greatest, shrines, in, the, christian, world, to, choose, from, it, seemed, that, when, the, local, arab, christians, had, a, problem, an, illness, or, something, more, complicated, they, preferred, to, seek, the, intercession, of, george, in, his, grubby, little, shrine, at, beit, jala, rather, than, praying, at, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, or, the, church, of, the, nativity, in, bethlehem, he, asked, the, priest, at, the, shrine, do, you, get, many, muslims, coming, here, the, priest, replied, we, get, hundreds, almost, as, many, as, the, christian, pilgrims, often, when, i, come, in, here, i, find, muslims, all, over, the, floor, in, the, aisles, up, and, down, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, quotes, g, a, smith, in, his, historic, geography, of, the, holy, land, p, 164, saying, the, mahommedans, who, usually, identify, st, george, with, the, prophet, elijah, at, lydda, confound, his, legend, with, one, about, christ, himself, their, name, for, antichrist, is, dajjal, and, they, have, a, tradition, that, jesus, will, slay, antichrist, by, the, gate, of, lydda, the, notion, sprang, from, an, ancient, bas, relief, of, george, and, the, dragon, on, the, lydda, church, but, dajjal, may, be, derived, by, a, very, common, confusion, between, n, and, l, from, dagon, whose, name, two, neighbouring, villages, bear, to, this, day, while, one, of, the, gates, of, lydda, used, to, be, called, the, gate, of, dagon, due, to, the, christian, influence, on, the, druze, faith, two, christian, saints, have, become, amongst, the, druze, s, most, venerated, figures, saint, george, and, saint, elijah, thus, in, all, the, villages, inhabited, by, druze, and, christians, in, central, mount, lebanon, a, christian, church, or, druze, maqam, is, dedicated, to, either, one, of, them, according, to, scholar, ray, jabre, mouawad, the, druzes, appreciated, the, two, saints, for, their, bravery, saint, george, because, he, confronted, the, dragon, and, saint, elijah, because, he, competed, with, the, pagan, priests, of, baal, and, won, over, them, in, both, cases, the, explanations, provided, by, christians, is, that, druzes, were, attracted, to, warrior, saints, that, resemble, their, own, militarized, society, george, is, described, as, a, prophetic, figure, in, islamic, sources, george, is, venerated, by, some, christians, and, muslims, because, of, his, composite, personality, combining, several, biblical, quranic, and, other, ancient, mythical, heroes, in, some, sources, he, is, identified, with, elijah, or, mar, elis, george, or, mar, jirjus, and, in, others, as, al, khidr, the, last, epithet, meaning, the, green, prophet, is, common, to, christian, muslim, and, druze, folk, piety, samuel, curtiss, who, visited, an, artificial, cave, dedicated, to, him, where, he, is, identified, with, elijah, reports, that, childless, muslim, women, used, to, visit, the, shrine, to, pray, for, children, per, tradition, he, was, brought, to, his, place, of, martyrdom, in, chains, thus, priests, of, church, of, st, george, chain, the, sick, especially, the, mentally, ill, to, a, chain, for, overnight, or, longer, for, healing, this, is, sought, after, by, both, muslims, and, christians, according, to, elizabeth, anne, finn, s, home, in, the, holy, land, 1866, st, george, killed, the, dragon, in, this, country, and, the, place, is, shown, close, to, beyroot, many, churches, and, convents, are, named, after, him, the, church, at, lydda, is, dedicated, to, george, so, is, a, convent, near, bethlehem, and, another, small, one, just, opposite, the, jaffa, gate, and, others, beside, the, arabs, believe, that, george, can, restore, mad, people, to, their, senses, and, to, say, a, person, has, been, sent, to, st, george, s, is, equivalent, to, saying, he, has, been, sent, to, a, madhouse, it, is, singular, that, the, moslem, arabs, adopted, this, veneration, for, st, george, and, send, their, mad, people, to, be, cured, by, him, as, well, as, the, christians, but, they, commonly, call, him, el, khudder, the, green, according, to, their, favourite, manner, of, using, epithets, instead, of, names, why, he, should, be, called, green, however, i, cannot, tell, unless, it, is, from, the, colour, of, his, horse, gray, horses, are, called, green, in, arabic, the, mosque, of, nabi, jurjis, which, was, restored, by, timur, in, the, 14th, century, was, located, in, mosul, and, supposedly, contained, the, tomb, of, george, it, was, however, destroyed, in, july, 2014, by, the, occupying, islamic, state, of, iraq, and, the, levant, who, also, destroyed, the, mosque, of, the, prophet, sheeth, seth, and, the, mosque, of, the, prophet, younis, jonah, the, militants, claimed, that, such, mosques, have, become, places, for, apostasy, instead, of, prayer, george, or, hazrat, jurjays, was, the, patron, saint, of, mosul, along, with, theodosius, he, was, revered, by, both, christian, and, muslim, communities, of, jazira, and, anatolia, the, wall, paintings, of, k, rk, dam, alt, kilise, at, belis, rma, dedicated, to, him, are, dated, between, 1282, and, 1304, these, paintings, depict, him, as, a, mounted, knight, appearing, between, donors, including, a, georgian, lady, called, thamar, and, her, husband, the, emir, and, consul, basil, while, the, seljuk, sultan, mesud, ii, and, byzantine,
