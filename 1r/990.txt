time, like, al, munawi, ibn, imad, al, hanbali, and, al, fayruzabadi, all, praised, ibn, arabi, as, a, righteous, friend, of, allah, and, faithful, scholar, of, knowledge, the, absolute, mujtahid, independent, thinker, without, doubt, and, the, imam, of, the, people, of, shari, a, both, in, knowledge, and, in, legacy, the, educator, of, the, people, of, the, way, in, practice, and, in, knowledge, and, the, shaykh, of, the, shaykhs, of, the, people, of, truth, though, spiritual, experience, dhawq, and, understanding, although, ibn, arabi, stated, on, more, than, one, occasion, that, he, did, not, blindly, follow, any, one, of, the, schools, of, islamic, jurisprudence, he, was, responsible, for, copying, and, preserving, books, of, the, zahirite, or, literalist, school, to, which, there, is, fierce, debate, whether, or, not, ibn, arabi, followed, that, school, ignaz, goldziher, held, that, ibn, arabi, did, in, fact, belong, to, the, zahirite, or, hanbali, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, hamza, dudgeon, claims, that, addas, chodkiewizc, gril, winkel, and, al, gorab, mistakenly, attribute, to, ibn, arab, non, madhhabism, on, an, extant, manuscript, of, ibn, azm, as, transmitted, by, ibn, arab, ibn, arab, gives, an, introduction, to, the, work, where, he, describes, a, vision, he, had, i, saw, myself, in, the, village, of, sharaf, near, siville, there, i, saw, a, plain, on, which, rose, an, elevation, on, this, elevation, the, prophet, stood, and, a, man, whom, i, did, not, know, approached, him, they, embraced, each, other, so, violently, that, they, seemed, to, interpenetrate, and, become, one, person, great, brightness, concealed, them, from, the, eyes, of, the, people, i, would, like, to, know, i, thought, who, is, this, strange, man, then, i, heard, some, one, say, this, is, the, traditionalist, al, ibn, azm, i, had, never, heard, ibn, azm, s, name, before, one, of, my, shaykhs, whom, i, questioned, informed, me, that, this, man, is, an, authority, in, the, field, of, science, of, hadeeth, goldziher, says, the, period, between, the, sixth, hijri, and, the, seventh, century, seems, also, to, have, been, the, prime, of, the, hirite, school, in, andalusia, ibn, arabi, did, delve, into, specific, details, at, times, and, was, known, for, his, view, that, religiously, binding, consensus, could, only, serve, as, a, source, of, sacred, law, if, it, was, the, consensus, of, the, first, generation, of, muslims, who, had, witnessed, revelation, directly, ibn, arabi, also, expounded, on, sufi, allegories, of, the, sharia, building, upon, previous, work, by, al, ghazali, and, al, hakim, al, tirmidhi, the, doctrine, of, perfect, man, al, ins, n, al, k, mil, is, popularly, considered, an, honorific, title, attributed, to, muhammad, having, its, origins, in, islamic, mysticism, although, the, concept, s, origin, is, controversial, and, disputed, arabi, may, have, first, coined, this, term, in, referring, to, adam, as, found, in, his, work, fusus, al, hikam, explained, as, an, individual, who, binds, himself, with, the, divine, and, creation, taking, an, idea, already, common, within, sufi, culture, ibn, arabi, applied, deep, analysis, and, reflection, on, the, concept, of, a, perfect, human, and, one, s, pursuit, in, fulfilling, this, goal, in, developing, his, explanation, of, the, perfect, being, ibn, arabi, first, discusses, the, issue, of, oneness, through, the, metaphor, of, the, mirror, in, this, philosophical, metaphor, ibn, arabi, compares, an, object, being, reflected, in, countless, mirrors, to, the, relationship, between, god, and, his, creatures, god, s, essence, is, seen, in, the, existent, human, being, as, god, is, the, object, and, human, beings, the, mirrors, meaning, two, things, that, since, humans, are, mere, reflections, of, god, there, can, be, no, distinction, or, separation, between, the, two, and, without, god, the, creatures, would, be, non, existent, when, an, individual, understands, that, there, is, no, separation, between, human, and, god, they, begin, on, the, path, of, ultimate, oneness, the, one, who, decides, to, walk, in, this, oneness, pursues, the, true, reality, and, responds, to, god, s, longing, to, be, known, the, search, within, for, this, reality, of, oneness, causes, one, to, be, reunited, with, god, as, well, as, improve, self, consciousness, the, perfect, human, through, this, developed, self, consciousness, and, self, realization, prompts, divine, self, manifestation, this, causes, the, perfect, human, to, be, of, both, divine, and, earthly, origin, ibn, arabi, metaphorically, calls, him, an, isthmus, being, an, isthmus, between, heaven, and, earth, the, perfect, human, fulfills, god, s, desire, to, be, known, god, s, presence, can, be, realized, through, him, by, others, ibn, arabi, expressed, that, through, self, manifestation, one, acquires, divine, knowledge, which, he, called, the, primordial, spirit, of, muhammad, and, all, its, perfection, ibn, arabi, details, that, the, perfect, human, is, of, the, cosmos, to, the, divine, and, conveys, the, divine, spirit, to, the, cosmos, ibn, arabi, further, explained, the, perfect, man, concept, using, at, least, twenty, two, different, descriptions, and, various, aspects, when, considering, the, logos, he, contemplated, the, logos, or, universal, man, as, a, mediation, between, the, individual, human, and, the, divine, essence, ibn, arabi, believed, muhammad, to, be, the, primary, perfect, man, who, exemplifies, the, morality, of, god, ibn, arabi, regarded, the, first, entity, brought, into, existence, was, the, reality, or, essence, of, muhammad, al, aq, qa, al, muhammadiyya, master, of, all, creatures, and, a, primary, role, model, for, human, beings, to, emulate, ibn, arabi, believed, that, god, s, attributes, and, names, are, manifested, in, this, world, with, the, most, complete, and, perfect, display, of, these, divine, attributes, and, names, seen, in, muhammad, ibn, arabi, believed, that, one, may, see, god, in, the, mirror, of, muhammad, he, maintained, that, muhammad, was, the, best, proof, of, god, and, by, knowing, muhammad, one, knows, god, ibn, arabi, also, described, adam, noah, abraham, moses, jesus, and, all, other, prophets, and, various, anbiya, allah, muslim, messengers, as, perfect, men, but, never, tires, of, attributing, lordship, inspirational, source, and, highest, rank, to, muhammad, ibn, arabi, compares, his, own, status, as, a, perfect, man, as, being, but, a, single, dimension, to, the, comprehensive, nature, of, muhammad, ibn, arabi, makes, extraordinary, assertions, regarding, his, own, spiritual, rank, but, qualifying, this, rather, audacious, correlation, by, asserting, his, inherited, perfection, is, only, a, single, dimension, of, the, comprehensive, perfection, of, muhammad, the, reaction, of, ibn, abd, as, salam, a, muslim, scholar, respected, by, both, ibn, arabi, s, supporters, and, detractors, has, been, of, note, due, to, disputes, over, whether, he, himself, was, a, supporter, or, detractor, he, was, known, by, the, title, of, sultan, al, ulama, the, sultan, of, scholars, was, a, famous, mujtahid, ash, ari, theologian, jurist, and, the, leading, shafi, i, authority, of, his, generation, as, such, the, figure, of, ibn, abd, al, salam, was, claimed, by, each, faction, of, the, ibn, arabi, controversy, due, to, his, impeccable, record, as, a, staunch, champion, of, the, shari, a, ibn, taymiyyah, s, report, was, based, on, the, authority, of, two, reliable, transmitters, abu, bakr, b, salar, and, ibn, daqiq, al, id, according, to, it, ibn, abd, al, salam, declared, ibn, arabi, a, master, of, evil, and, a, disgusting, man, who, professed, the, eternity, of, the, world, and, did, not, proscribe, fornication, this, severe, verdict, whose, authenticity, ibn, taymiyyah, considered, to, be, beyond, doubt, was, pronounced, by, ibn, abd, al, salam, upon, his, arrival, in, egypt, in, 639, 1241, that, is, one, year, after, his, death, the, versions, of, the, story, furnished, by, al, safadi, a, cautious, supporter, of, ibn, arabi, and, al, dhahabi, his, bitter, critic, and, teacher, of, al, safadi, are, especially, helpful, in, placing, ibn, abd, al, salam, s, censure, into, a, meaningful, historical, framework, both, al, safadi, and, al, dhahabi, insisted, that, they, read, the, story, recorded, in, ibn, sayyid, al, nas, s, own, hand, and, yet, their, versions, vary, both, variants, describe, ibn, daqiq, al, id, s, astonishment, at, his, teacher, s, sharp, critique, of, the, acclaimed, wali, which, caused, him, to, ask, for, proof, of, ibn, arabi, s, lies, ibn, abd, al, salam, obliged, by, the, following, reply, in, al, safadi, s, recension, he, used, to, deny, of, marriage, between, human, beings, and, the, jinn, since, according, to, him, the, jinn, are, subtle, spirits, whereas, human, beings, are, solid, bodies, hence, the, two, cannot, unite, later, on, however, he, claimed, that, he, had, married, a, woman, from, the, jinnfolk, who, stayed, with, him, for, a, while, then, hit, him, with, a, camel, s, bone, and, injured, him, he, used, to, show, us, the, scar, on, his, face, which, by, that, time, had, closed, in, al, dhahabi, s, rendition, he, said, i, married, a, she, jinni, and, she, blessed, me, with, three, children, then, it, so, happened, that, i, made, her, angry, and, she, hit, me, with, a, bone, that, caused, this, scar, whereupon, she, departed, and, i, have, never, seen, her, again, since, the, authenticity, of, ibn, abd, al, salam, s, disparagement, of, ibn, arabi, seems, to, find, support, in, his, epistle, on, the, substitutes, and, the, succor, risala, fil, abdal, wal, ghawth, on, the, other, hand, another, narration, in, praise, of, ibn, arabi, by, al, izz, is, reported, by, abd, al, ghaffar, al, qusi, al, fayruzabadi, al, qari, al, baghdadi, al, suyuti, al, sha, rani, al, maqqari, ibn, al, imad, and, some, other, supporters, despite, minor, variations, in, their, accounts, all, of, them, cite, the, same, source, lbn, abd, al, salam, s, unnamed, servant, or, student, in, al, qusi, s, redaction, ibn, abd, al, salam, and, his, servant, were, passing, by, ibn, arabi, who, instructed, his, disciples, in, the, great, umayyad, mosque, of, damuscus, suddenly, the, servant, recalled, that, ibn, abd, al, salam, had, promised, to, reveal, to, him, the, identity, of, the, supreme, saint, of, the, epoch, the, pole, of, the, age, the, question, caught, ibn, abd, al, salam, off, guard, he, paused, hesitantly, for, a, moment, then, pointed, in, the, direction, of, ibn, arabi, saying, he, is, the, pole, and, this, in, spite, of, what, you, have, said, against, him, asked, the, servant, ibn, abd, al, salam, ignored, this, remark, and, simply, repeated, his, reply, in, al, fayruzabadi, s, version, of, the, story, ibn, abd, al, salam, is, presented, as, a, secret, admirer, of, his, who, was, fully, aware, of, the, latter, s, exalted, status, in, the, sufi, hierarchy, however, as, a, public, figure, ibn, abd, al, salam, was, careful, to, conceal, his, genuine, opinion, of, the, controversial, sufi, in, order, to, preserve, the, outward, aspect, of, the, religious, law, in, so, doing, he, according, to, al, fayruzabadi, shrewdly, avoided, an, inevitable, confrontation, with, the, jurists, who, viewed, ibn, arabi, as, a, heretic, the, importance, of, ibn, abd, al, salam, s, ambiguous, evaluation, of, ibn, arabi, for, the, subsequent, polemic, is, further, attested, by, the, detailed, treatment, of, this, story, in, al, fasi, s, massive, biographical, dictionary, the, precious, necklace, al, lqd, al, thamin, a, bitter, critic, of, ibn, arabi, s, monistic, views, al, fasi, rejected, the, sufi, version, of, the, story, as, sheer, fabrication, yet, as, a, scrupulous, muhaddith, he, tried, to, justify, his, position, through, the, methods, current, in, hadith, criticism, i, have, a, strong, suspicion, that, this, story, was, invented, by, the, extremist, sufis, who, were, infatuated, with, ibn, arabi, thereupon, the, story, gained, wide, diffusion, until, it, reached, some, trustworthy, people, who, accepted, it, in, good, faith, my, suspicion, regarding, the, authenticity, of, this, story, has, grown, stronger, because, of, the, unfounded, supposition, that, ibn, abd, al, salam, s, praise, of, ibn, arabi, had, occurred, simultaneously, with, his, censure, of, him, ibn, abd, al, salam, s, statement, that, he, censured, ibn, arabi, out, of, concern, for, the, shari, a, inescapably, implies, that, ibn, arabi, enjoyed, a, high, rank, in, the, same, moment, as, ibn, abd, al, salam, was, censuring, him, such, a, blunder, could, not, have, happened, to, any, reliable, religious, scholar, let, alone, to, someone, as, knowledgeable, and, righteous, as, ibn, abd, al, salam, anyone, who, suspects, him, of, this, makes, a, mistake, and, commits, a, sin, mutually, contradictory, statements, one, may, try, to, explain, ibn, abd, al, salam, s, praise, of, ibn, arabi, if, it, indeed, took, place, by, the, fact, that, was, hesitating, between, praise, and, censure, because, at, the, time, he, spoke, ibn, arabi, s, state, had, changed, for, the, better, if, so, there, is, no, contradiction, in, ibn, abd, al, salam, s, words, were, we, to, admit, that, the, praise, really, occurred, it, was, nevertheless, abrogated, by, ibn, daqiq, al, id, s, report, concerning, lbn, abd, al, salam, s, condemnation,
