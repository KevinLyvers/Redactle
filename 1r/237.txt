wives, kept, separate, households, children, were, raised, with, their, mothers, although, the, patrilineal, system, was, still, followed, murasaki, was, unconventional, because, she, lived, in, her, father, s, household, most, likely, on, teramachi, street, in, kyoto, with, her, younger, brother, nobunori, their, mother, died, perhaps, in, childbirth, when, they, were, quite, young, murasaki,

becoming, more, isolated, after, missions, to, china, had, ended, and, a, stronger, national, culture, was, emerging, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, japanese, gradually, became, a, written, language, through, the, development, of, kana, a, syllabary, based, on, abbreviations, of, chinese, characters, in, murasaki, s, lifetime, men, continued, to, write, formally, in, chinese, but, kana, became, the, written, language, of, intimacy, and, of, noblewomen, setting, the, foundation, for, unique, forms, of, japanese, literature, chinese, was, taught, to, murasaki, s, brother, as, preparation, for, a, career, in, government, and, during, her, childhood, living, in, her, father, s, household, she, learned, and, became, proficient, in, classical, chinese, in, her, diary, she, wrote, when, my, brother, was, a, young, boy, learning, the, chinese, classics, i, was, in, the, habit, of, listening, to, him, and, i, became, unusually, proficient, at, understanding, those, passages, that, he, found, too, difficult, to, understand, and, memorize, father, a, most, learned, man, was, always, regretting, the, fact, just, my, luck, he, would, say, what, a, pity, she, was, not, born, a, man, with, her, brother, she, studied, chinese, literature, and, she, probably, also, received, instruction, in, more, traditional, subjects, such, as, music, calligraphy, and, japanese, poetry, murasaki, s, education, was, unorthodox, louis, perez, explains, in, the, history, of, japan, that, women, were, thought, to, be, incapable, of, real, intelligence, and, therefore, were, not, educated, in, chinese, murasaki, was, aware, that, others, saw, her, as, pretentious, awkward, difficult, to, approach, prickly, too, fond, of, her, tales, haughty, prone, to, versifying, disdainful, cantankerous, and, scornful, asian, literature, scholar, thomas, inge, believes, she, had, a, forceful, personality, that, seldom, won, her, friends, aristocratic, heian, women, lived, restricted, and, secluded, lives, allowed, to, speak, to, men, only, when, they, were, close, relatives, or, household, members, murasaki, s, autobiographical, poetry, shows, that, she, socialized, with, women, but, had, limited, contact, with, men, other, than, her, father, and, brother, she, often, exchanged, poetry, with, women, but, never, with, men, unlike, most, noblewomen, of, her, status, however, she, did, not, marry, on, reaching, puberty, instead, she, stayed, in, her, father, s, household, until, her, mid, twenties, or, perhaps, even, to, her, early, thirties, in, 996, when, her, father, was, posted, to, a, four, year, governorship, in, echizen, province, murasaki, went, with, him, although, it, was, uncommon, for, a, noblewoman, of, the, period, to, travel, such, a, distance, that, could, take, as, long, as, five, days, she, returned, to, kyoto, probably, in, 998, to, marry, her, father, s, friend, fujiwara, no, nobutaka, a, much, older, second, cousin, descended, from, the, same, branch, of, the, fujiwara, clan, he, was, a, court, functionary, and, bureaucrat, at, the, ministry, of, ceremonials, with, a, reputation, for, dressing, extravagantly, and, as, a, talented, dancer, in, his, late, forties, at, the, time, of, their, marriage, he, had, multiple, households, with, an, unknown, number, of, wives, and, offspring, gregarious, and, well, known, at, court, he, was, involved, in, numerous, romantic, relationships, that, may, have, continued, after, his, marriage, to, murasaki, as, was, customary, she, would, have, remained, in, her, father, s, household, where, her, husband, would, have, visited, her, nobutaka, had, been, granted, more, than, one, governorship, and, by, the, time, of, his, marriage, to, murasaki, he, was, probably, quite, wealthy, interpretations, of, their, marital, relationship, differ, among, scholars, richard, bowring, suggests, a, harmonious, marriage, while, japanese, literature, scholar, haruo, shirane, finds, evidence, of, resentment, towards, her, husband, in, murasaki, s, poems, the, couple, s, daughter, kenshi, kataiko, was, born, in, 999, two, years, later, nobutaka, died, during, a, cholera, epidemic, as, a, married, woman, murasaki, would, have, had, servants, to, run, the, household, and, care, for, her, daughter, giving, her, ample, leisure, time, she, enjoyed, reading, and, had, access, to, romances, monogatari, such, as, the, tale, of, the, bamboo, cutter, and, the, tales, of, ise, scholars, believe, she, may, have, started, writing, the, tale, of, genji, before, her, husband, s, death, it, is, known, she, was, writing, after, she, was, widowed, perhaps, in, a, state, of, grief, in, her, diary, she, describes, her, feelings, after, her, husband, s, death, i, felt, depressed, and, confused, for, some, years, i, had, existed, from, day, to, day, in, listless, fashion, doing, little, more, than, registering, the, passage, of, time, the, thought, of, my, continuing, loneliness, was, quite, unbearable, according, to, legend, murasaki, retreated, to, ishiyama, dera, at, lake, biwa, where, she, was, inspired, to, write, the, tale, of, genji, on, an, august, night, while, looking, at, the, moon, although, scholars, dismiss, the, factual, basis, of, the, story, of, her, retreat, japanese, artists, often, depicted, her, at, ishiyama, temple, staring, at, the, moon, for, inspiration, she, may, have, been, commissioned, to, write, the, story, and, may, have, known, an, exiled, courtier, in, a, similar, position, to, her, hero, prince, genji, murasaki, would, have, distributed, newly, written, chapters, of, genji, to, friends, who, in, turn, would, have, re, copied, them, and, passed, them, on, by, this, practice, the, story, became, known, and, she, gained, a, reputation, as, an, author, in, her, early, to, mid, thirties, she, became, a, lady, in, waiting, ny, b, at, court, most, likely, because, of, her, reputation, as, an, author, chieko, mulhern, writes, in, japanese, women, writers, a, biocritical, sourcebook, that, scholars, have, wondered, why, murasaki, made, such, a, move, at, a, comparatively, late, period, in, her, life, her, diary, evidences, that, she, exchanged, poetry, with, michinaga, after, her, husband, s, death, leading, to, speculation, that, the, two, may, have, been, lovers, bowring, sees, no, evidence, that, she, was, brought, to, court, as, michinaga, s, concubine, although, he, did, bring, her, to, court, without, following, official, channels, mulhern, thinks, michinaga, wanted, to, have, murasaki, at, court, to, educate, his, daughter, sh, shi, heian, culture, and, court, life, reached, a, peak, early, in, the, 11th, century, the, population, of, kyoto, grew, to, around, 100, 000, as, the, nobility, became, increasingly, isolated, at, the, heian, palace, in, government, posts, and, court, service, courtiers, became, overly, refined, with, little, to, do, insulated, from, reality, preoccupied, with, the, minutiae, of, court, life, turning, to, artistic, endeavors, emotions, were, commonly, expressed, through, the, artistic, use, of, textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored, paper, poetry, and, layering, of, clothing, in, pleasing, color, combinations, according, to, mood, and, season, those, who, showed, an, inability, to, follow, conventional, aesthetics, quickly, lost, popularity, particularly, at, court, popular, pastimes, for, heian, noblewomen, who, adhered, to, rigid, fashions, of, floor, length, hair, whitened, skin, and, blackened, teeth, included, having, love, affairs, writing, poetry, and, keeping, diaries, the, literature, that, heian, court, women, wrote, is, recognized, as, some, of, the, earliest, and, among, the, best, literature, written, in, japanese, canon, when, in, 995, michinaga, s, two, brothers, fujiwara, no, michitaka, and, fujiwara, no, michikane, died, leaving, the, regency, vacant, michinaga, quickly, won, a, power, struggle, against, his, nephew, fujiwara, no, korechika, brother, to, teishi, emperor, ichij, s, wife, and, aided, by, his, sister, senshi, he, assumed, power, teishi, had, supported, her, brother, korechika, who, was, discredited, and, banished, from, court, in, 996, following, a, scandal, involving, his, shooting, at, the, retired, emperor, kazan, causing, her, to, lose, power, four, years, later, michinaga, sent, sh, shi, his, eldest, daughter, to, emperor, ichij, s, harem, when, she, was, about, 12, a, year, after, placing, sh, shi, in, the, imperial, harem, in, an, effort, to, undermine, teishi, s, influence, and, increase, sh, shi, s, standing, michinaga, had, her, named, empress, although, teishi, already, held, the, title, as, historian, donald, shively, explains, michinaga, shocked, even, his, admirers, by, arranging, for, the, unprecedented, appointment, of, teishi, or, sadako, and, sh, shi, as, concurrent, empresses, of, the, same, emperor, teishi, holding, the, usual, title, of, lustrous, heir, bearer, k, g, and, sh, shi, that, of, inner, palatine, ch, g, a, toponymically, derived, equivalent, coined, for, the, occasion, about, five, years, later, michinaga, brought, murasaki, to, sh, shi, s, court, in, a, position, that, bowring, describes, as, a, companion, tutor, women, of, high, status, lived, in, seclusion, at, court, and, through, strategic, marriages, were, used, to, gain, political, power, for, their, families, in, the, case, of, sh, shi, and, other, such, marriages, to, members, of, the, imperial, clan, it, enabled, the, woman, s, clan, to, exercise, influence, over, the, emperor, this, was, how, michinaga, and, other, fujiwara, regents, achieved, their, power, despite, their, seclusion, some, women, wielded, considerable, influence, often, achieved, through, competitive, salons, dependent, on, the, quality, of, those, attending, ichij, s, mother, and, michinaga, s, sister, senshi, had, an, influential, salon, and, michinaga, probably, wanted, sh, shi, to, surround, herself, with, skilled, women, such, as, murasaki, to, build, a, rival, salon, sh, shi, was, 16, to, 19, when, murasaki, joined, her, court, either, in, 1005, or, 1006, according, to, arthur, waley, sh, shi, was, a, serious, minded, young, lady, whose, living, arrangements, were, divided, between, her, father, s, household, and, her, court, at, the, imperial, palace, she, gathered, around, her, talented, women, writers, such, as, izumi, shikibu, and, akazome, emon, the, author, of, an, early, vernacular, history, the, tale, of, flowering, fortunes, the, rivalry, that, existed, among, the, women, is, evident, in, murasaki, s, diary, where, she, wrote, disparagingly, of, izumi, izumi, shikibu, is, an, amusing, letter, writer, but, there, is, something, not, very, satisfactory, about, her, she, has, a, gift, for, dashing, off, informal, compositions, in, a, careless, running, hand, but, in, poetry, she, needs, either, an, interesting, subject, or, some, classic, model, to, imitate, indeed, it, does, not, seem, to, me, that, in, herself, she, is, really, a, poet, at, all, sei, sh, nagon, author, of, the, pillow, book, had, been, in, service, as, lady, in, waiting, to, teishi, when, sh, shi, came, to, court, it, is, possible, that, murasaki, was, invited, to, sh, shi, s, court, as, a, rival, to, sh, nagon, teishi, died, in, 1001, before, murasaki, entered, service, with, sh, shi, so, the, two, writers, were, not, there, concurrently, but, murasaki, who, wrote, about, sh, nagon, in, her, diary, certainly, knew, of, her, and, to, an, extent, was, influenced, by, her, sh, nagon, s, the, pillow, book, may, have, been, commissioned, as, a, type, of, propaganda, to, highlight, teishi, s, court, known, for, its, educated, ladies, in, waiting, japanese, literature, scholar, joshua, mostow, believes, michinaga, provided, murasaki, to, sh, shi, as, an, equally, or, better, educated, woman, so, as, to, showcase, sh, shi, s, court, in, a, similar, manner, the, two, writers, had, different, temperaments, sh, nagon, was, witty, clever, and, outspoken, murasaki, was, withdrawn, and, sensitive, entries, in, murasaki, s, diary, show, that, the, two, may, not, have, been, on, good, terms, murasaki, wrote, sei, sh, nagon, was, dreadfully, conceited, she, thought, herself, so, clever, littered, her, writing, with, chinese, characters, left, a, great, deal, to, be, desired, keene, thinks, that, murasaki, s, impression, of, sh, nagon, could, have, been, influenced, by, sh, shi, and, the, women, at, her, court, as, sh, nagon, served, sh, shi, s, rival, empress, furthermore, he, believes, murasaki, was, brought, to, court, to, write, genji, in, response, to, sh, nagon, s, popular, pillow, book, murasaki, contrasted, herself, to, sh, nagon, in, a, variety, of, ways, she, denigrated, the, pillow, book, genre, and, unlike, sh, nagon, who, flaunted, her, knowledge, of, chinese, murasaki, pretended, to, not, know, the, language, regarding, it, as, pretentious, and, affected, although, the, popularity, of, the, chinese, language, diminished, in, the, late, heian, era, chinese, ballads, continued, to, be, popular, including, those, written, by, bai, juyi, murasaki, taught, chinese, to, sh, shi, who, was, interested, in, chinese, art, and, juyi, s, ballads, upon, becoming, empress, sh, shi, installed, screens, decorated, with, chinese, script, causing, outrage, because, written, chinese, was, considered, the, language, of, men, far, removed, from, the, women, s, quarters, the, study, of, chinese, was, thought, to, be, unladylike, and, went, against, the, notion, that, only, men, should, have, access, to, the, literature, women, were, supposed, to, read, and, write, only, in, japanese, which, separated, them, through, language, from, government, and, the, power, structure, murasaki, with, her, unconventional, classical, chinese, education, was, one, of, the, few, women, available, to, teach, sh, shi, classical, chinese, bowring, writes, it, was, almost, subversive, that, murasaki, knew, chinese, and, taught, the, language, to, sh, shi, murasaki, who, was, reticent, about, her, chinese, education, held, the, lessons, between, the, two, women, in, secret, writing, in, her, diary, since, last, summer, very, secretly, in, odd, moments, when, there, happened, to, be, no, one, about, i, have, been, reading, with, her, majesty, there, has, of, course, been, no, question, of, formal, lessons, i, have, thought, it, best, to, say, nothing, about, the, matter, to, anybody, murasaki, probably, earned, an, ambiguous, nickname, the, lady, of, the, chronicles, nihongi, no, tsubone, for, teaching, sh, shi, chinese, literature, a, lady, in, waiting, who, disliked, murasaki, accused, her, of, flaunting, her, knowledge, of, chinese, and, began, calling, her, the, lady, of, the, chronicles, an, allusion, to, the, classic, chronicles, of, japan, after, an, incident, in, which, chapters, from, genji, were, read, aloud, to, the, emperor, and, his, courtiers, one, of, whom, remarked, that, the, author, showed, a, high, level, of, education, murasaki, wrote, in, her, diary, how, utterly, ridiculous, would, i, who, hesitate, to, reveal, my, learning, to, my, women, at, home, ever, think, of, doing, so, at, court, although, the, nickname, was, apparently, meant, to, be, disparaging, mulhern, believes, murasaki, was, flattered, by, it, the, attitude, toward, the, chinese, language, was, contradictory, in, teishi, s, court, the, chinese, language, had, been, flaunted, and, considered, a, symbol, of, imperial, rule, and, superiority, yet, in, sh, shi, s, salon, there, was, a, great, deal, of, hostility, towards, the, language, perhaps, owing, to, political, expedience, during, a, period, when, chinese, began, to, be, rejected, in, favor, of, japanese, even, though, sh, shi, herself, was, a, student, of, the, language, the, hostility, may, have, affected, murasaki, and, her, opinion, of, the, court, and, forced, her, to, hide, her, knowledge, of, chinese, unlike, sh, nagon, who, was, both, ostentatious, and, flirtatious, as, well, as, outspoken, about, her, knowledge, of, chinese, murasaki, seems, to, have, been, humble, an, attitude, which, possibly, impressed, michinaga, although, murasaki, used, chinese, and, incorporated, it, in, her, writing, she, publicly, rejected, the, language, a, commendable, attitude, during, a, period, of, burgeoning, japanese, culture, murasaki, seems, to, have, been, unhappy, with, court, life, and, was, withdrawn, and, somber, no, surviving, records, show, that, she, entered, poetry, competitions, she, appears, to, have, exchanged, few, poems, or, letters, with, other, women, during, her, service, in, general, unlike, sh, nagon, murasaki, gives, the, impression, in, her, diary, that, she, disliked, court, life, the, other, ladies, in, waiting, and, the, drunken, revelry, she, did, however, become, close, friends, with, a, lady, in, waiting, named, lady, saish, and, she, wrote, of, the, winters, that, she, enjoyed, i, love, to, see, the, snow, here, according, to, waley, murasaki, may, not, have, been, unhappy, with, court, life, in, general, but, bored, in, sh, shi, s, court, he, speculates, she, would, have, preferred, to, serve, with, the, lady, senshi, whose, household, seems, to, have, been, less, strict, and, more, light, hearted, in, her, diary, murasaki, wrote, about, sh, shi, s, court, has, gathered, round, her, a, number, of, very, worthy, young, ladies, her, majesty, is, beginning, to, acquire, more, experience, of, life, and, no, longer, judges, others, by, the, same, rigid, standards, as, before, but, meanwhile, her, court, has, gained, a, reputation, for, extreme, dullness, murasaki, disliked, the, men, at, court, whom, she, thought, were, drunken, and, stupid, however, some, scholars, such, as, waley, are, certain, she, was, involved, romantically, with, michinaga, at, the, least, michinaga, pursued, her, and, pressured, her, strongly, and, her, flirtation, with, him, is, recorded, in, her, diary, as, late, as, 1010, yet, she, wrote, to, him, in, a, poem, you, have, neither, read, my, book, nor, won, my, love, in, her, diary, she, records, having, to, avoid, advances, from, michinaga, one, night, he, sneaked, into, her, room, stealing, a, newly, written, chapter, of, genji, however, michinaga, s, patronage, was, essential, if, she, was, to, continue, writing, murasaki, described, her, daughter, s, court, activities, the, lavish, ceremonies, the, complicated, courtships, the, complexities, of, the, marriage, system, and, in, elaborate, detail, the, birth, of, sh, shi, s, two, sons, it, is, likely, that, murasaki, enjoyed, writing, in, solitude, she,

disapproved, rank, was, important, in, heian, court, society, and, murasaki, would, not, have, felt, herself, to, have, much, if, anything, in, common, with, the, higher, ranked, and, more, powerful, fujiwaras, in, her, diary, she, wrote, of, her, life, at, court, i, realized, that, my, branch, of, the, family, was, a, very, humble, one, but, the, thought, seldom, troubled, me, and, i, was, in, those, days, far, indeed, from, the, painful, consciousness, of, inferiority, which, makes, life, at, court, a, continual, torment, to, me, a, court, position, would, have, increased, her, social, standing, but, more, importantly, she, gained, a, greater, experience, to, write, about, court, life, as, she, experienced, it, is, well, reflected, in, the, chapters, of, genji, written, after, she, joined, sh, shi, the, name, murasaki, was, most, probably, given, to, her, at, a, court, dinner, in, an, incident, she, recorded, in, her, diary, in, 1008, the, well, known, court, poet, fujiwara, no, kint, inquired, after, the, young, murasaki, an, allusion, to, the, character, named, murasaki, in, genji, which, would, have, been, considered, a, compliment, from, a, male, court, poet, to, a, female, author, when, emperor, ichij, died, in, 1011, sh, shi, retired, from, the, imperial, palace, to, live, in, a, fujiwara, mansion, in, biwa, most, likely, accompanied, by, murasaki, who, is, recorded, as, being, there, with, sh, shi, in, 1013, george, aston, explains, that, when, murasaki, retired, from, court, she, was, again, associated, with, ishiyama, dera, to, this, beautiful, spot,

refuse, to, believe, this, story, pointing, out, that, it, is, irreconcilable, with, known, facts, on, the, other, hand, the, very, chamber, in, the, temple, where, the, genji, was, written, is, shown, with, the, ink, slab, which, the, author, used, and, a, buddhist, sutra, in, her, handwriting, which, if, they, do, not, satisfy, the, critic, still, are, sufficient, to, carry, conviction, to, the, minds, of, ordinary, visitors, to, the, temple, murasaki, may, have, died, in, 1014, her, father, made, a, hasty, return, to, kyoto, from, his, post, at, echigo, province, that, year, possibly, because, of, her, death, writing, in, a, bridge, of, dreams, a, poetics, of, the, tale, of, genji, shirane, mentions, that, 1014, is, generally, accepted, as, the, date, of, murasaki, shikibu, s,

around, 1011, which, combined, with, the, death, of, his, daughter, may, have, prompted, her, father, to, resign, his, post, and, take, vows, at, miidera, temple, where, he, died, in, 1029, murasaki,

from, about, 1008, to, 1010, the, long, descriptive, passages, some, of, which, may, have, originated, as, letters, cover, her, relationships, with, the, other, ladies, in, waiting, michinaga, s,

the, story, of, the, shining, prince, genji, is, set, in, the, late, 9th, to, early, 10th, centuries, and, murasaki, eliminated, from, it, the, elements, of, fairy, tales, and, fantasy, frequently, found, in, earlier, monogatari, the, themes, in, genji, are, common, to, the, period, and, are, defined, by, shively, as, encapsulating, the, tyranny, of, time, and, the, inescapable, sorrow, of,
