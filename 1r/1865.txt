to, master, it, kan, matriculated, at, the, university, of, tokyo, in, 1877, and, graduated, with, a, b, a, in, political, science, and, philosophy, in, 1882, during, his, time, at, the, university, he, started, looking, for, j, jutsu, teachers, he, first, looked, for, bonesetters, called, seifukushi, his, assumption, was, that, doctors, who, knew, the, martial, art, were, better, teachers, his, search, brought, him, to, yagi, teinosuke, who, had, been, a, student, of, emon, isomata, in, the, tenjin, shin, y, ry, school, of, j, jutsu, yagi, in, turn, referred, kan, to, fukuda, hachinosuke, a,

of, the, technique, fukuda, stressed, applied, technique, over, ritual, form, he, gave, beginners, a, short, description, of, the, technique, and, had, them, engage, in, free, practice, randori, in, order, to, teach, through, experience, it, was, only, after, the, student, had, attained, some, proficiency, that, he, taught, them, traditional, forms, kata, this, method, was, difficult, as, there, were, no, special, mats, for, falling, only, the, standard, straw, mats, tatami, laid, over, wooden, floors, kan, had, trouble, defeating, fukushima, kanekichi, who, was, one, of, his, seniors, at, the, school, therefore, kan, started, trying, unfamiliar, techniques, on, his, rival, he, first, tried, techniques, from, sumo, taught, by, a, former, practitioner, named, uchiyama, kisoemon, when, these, did, not, help, he, studied, more, and, tried, a, technique, fireman, s, carry, that, he, learned, from, a, book, on, western, wrestling, this, worked, and, kataguruma, or, shoulder, wheel, remains, part, of, the, judo, repertoire, although, at, this, moment, the, judo, organizations, of, some, countries, prohibit, this, throw, in, competition, judo, on, 5, august, 1879, kan, participated, in, a, j, jutsu, demonstration, given, for, former, united, states, president, ulysses, s, grant, this, demonstration, took, place, at, the, home, of, the, prominent, businessman, shibusawa, eiichi, other, people, involved, in, this, demonstration, included, the, j, jutsu, teachers, fukuda, hachinosuke, and, iso, masatomo, and, kan, s, training, partner, godai, ryusaku, fukuda, died, soon, after, this, demonstration, at, the, age, of, 52, kan, began, studying, with, iso, who, had, been, a, friend, of, fukuda, despite, being, 62, years, old, and, standing, only, 5, feet, 1, 52, m, tall, iso, had, gained, a, powerful, build, from, jujitsu, training, he, was, known, for, excellence, in, kata, and, was, also, a, specialist, in, atemi, or, the, striking, of, vital, areas, in, iso, s, method, one, began, with, kata, and, then, progressed, to, free, fighting, randori, due, to, kan, s, intense, practice, and, his, solid, grounding, in, the, jujitsu, taught, by, fukuda, he, was, soon, an, assistant, at, iso, s, school, in, 1881, fukuda, s, widow, gave, the, scrolls, of, the, school, to, kan, then, 21, years, old, some, popular, works, suggest, that, kan, obtained, a, teaching, license, in, this, school, but, this, has, not, been, documented, no, tenjin, shin, y, ry, certificate, s, with, kan, s, name, visible, is, depicted, anywhere, in, the, k, d, kan, museum, or, in, any, published, source, neither, is, such, rank, specified, in, any, authentic, tenjin, shin, y, ry, archival, documents, while, under, iso, s, tutelage, kan, witnessed, a, demonstration, by, the, y, shin, ry, j, jutsu, teacher, totsuka, hikosuke, and, later, took, part, in, randori, with, members, of, totsuka, s, school, kan, was, impressed, by, the, y, shin, ry, practitioners, and, realized, that, he, might, never, be, able, to, beat, someone, as, talented, as, totsuka, simply, by, training, harder, he, also, needed, to, train, smarter, it, was, this, experience, that, first, led, kan, to, believe, that, to, be, truly, superior, one, needed, to, combine, the, best, elements, of, several, ry, or, schools, of, j, jutsu, including, yagyu, shingan, ry, taijutsu, toward, this, end, he, began, to, seek, teachers, who, could, provide, him, with, superior, elements, of, j, jutsu, that, he, could, adopt, after, iso, died, in, 1881, kan, began, training, in, kit, ry, with, iikubo, tsunetoshi, k, nen, iikubo, was, an, expert, in, kata, and, throwing, and, fond, of, randori, kan, applied, himself, thoroughly, to, learning, kit, ry, believing, iikubo, s, throwing, techniques, in, particular, to, be, better, than, in, the, schools, he, had, previously, studied, it, is, iikubo, who, issued, kan, a, documented, j, jutsu, rank, and, teaching, credential, namely, a, certificate, of, menkyo, not, menkyo, kaiden, in, nihonden, kit, j, d, dated, october, 1883, during, the, early, 1880s, there, was, no, clear, separation, between, the, j, jutsu, that, kan, was, teaching, and, the, j, jutsu, that, his, teachers, had, taught, in, the, past, kan, s, kit, ry, teacher, iikubo, tsunetoshi, came, to, kan, s, classes, two, or, three, times, a, week, to, support, kan, s, teaching, eventually, student, and, master, began, to, exchange, places, and, kan, began, to, defeat, iikubo, during, randori, usually, it, had, been, him, that, threw, me, now, instead, of, being, thrown, i, was, throwing, him, with, increasing, regularity, i, could, do, this, despite, the, fact, that, he, was, of, the, kito, ryu, school, and, was, especially, adept, at, throwing, techniques, this, apparently, surprised, him, and, he, was, quite, upset, over, it, for, quite, a, while, what, i, had, done, was, quite, unusual, but, it, was, the, result, of, my, study, of, how, to, break, the, posture, of, the, opponent, it, was, true, that, i, had, been, studying, the, problem, for, quite, some, time, together, with, that, of, reading, the, opponent, s, motion, but, it, was, here, that, i, first, tried, to, apply, thoroughly, the, principle, of, breaking, the, opponent, s, posture, before, moving, in, for, the, throw, i, told, mr, iikubo, about, this, explaining, that, the, throw, should, be, applied, after, one, has, broken, the, opponent, s, posture, then, he, said, to, me, this, is, right, i, am, afraid, i, have, nothing, more, to, teach, you, soon, afterward, i, was, initiated, in, the, mystery, of, kito, ryu, jujitsu, and, received, all, his, books, and, manuscripts, of, the, school, to, name, his, system, kan, revived, a, term, that, terada, kan, emon, the, fifth, headmaster, of, the, kit, ry, had, adopted, when, he, founded, his, own, style, the, jikishin, ry, j, d, the, name, combined, the, characters, j, meaning, pliancy, and, d, which, is, literally, the, way, but, figuratively, meaning, method, from, a, technical, standpoint, kan, combined, the, throwing, techniques, of, the, kit, ry, and, the, choking, and, pinning, techniques, of, the, tenjin, shin, y, ry, as, such, judo, s, koshiki, no, kata, preserves, the, traditional, forms, of, the, kit, ry, with, only, minor, differences, from, the, mainline, tradition, similarly, many, of, the, techniques, but, not, the, forms, of, the, tenjin, shin, y, ry, are, preserved, in, the, kime, no, kata, kan, s, initial, work, was, influenced, by, various, methods, and, institutions, as, he, wrote, in, 1898, by, taking, together, all, the, good, points, i, had, learned, of, the, various, schools, and, adding, thereto, my, own, inventions, and, discoveries, i, devised, a, new, system, for, physical, culture, and, moral, training, as, well, as, for, winning, contests, however, after, judo, was, introduced, into, the, japanese, public, schools, a, process, that, took, place, between, 1906, and, 1917, there, was, increasing, standardization, of, kata, and, tournament, technique, kan, also, oversaw, the, development, and, growth, of, his, judo, organization, the, kodokan, judo, institute, this, was, a, remarkable, effort, in, itself, as, the, kodokan, s, enrollment, grew, from, fewer, than, a, dozen, students, in, 1882, to, more, than, a, thousand, dan, graded, members, by, 1911, in, may, or, june, 1882, kan, started, the, kodokan, judo, with, twelve, mats, in, space, belonging, to, the, eish, ji, a, buddhist, temple, in, what, was, then, the, shitaya, ward, of, tokyo, now, the, higashi, ueno, district, of, tait, ward, with, iikubo, attending, the, d, j, three, days, a, week, to, help, teach, kan, had, only, a, handful, of, students, at, this, time, but, they, improved, their, technique, through, regular, contests, with, local, police, j, jutsu, teams, the, kodokan, moved, to, a, 60, mat, space, in, april, 1890, in, december, 1893, the, kodokan, started, moving, to, a, larger, space, located, in, tomizaka, cho, koishikawa, cho, and, the, move, was, completed, by, february, 1894, the, kodokan, s, first, kangeiko, or, winter, training, took, place, at, the, tomizaka, cho, dojo, during, the, winter, of, 1894, 1895, midsummer, training, or, shochugeiko, started, in, 1896, in, order, to, inure, the, pupil, to, the, two, extremes, of, heat, and, cold, and, to, cultivate, the, virtue, of, perseverance, britain, s, e, j, harrison, wrote, all, dojo, including, the, kodokan, hold, special, summer, and, winter, exercises, for, the, former, the, hottest, month, of, the, year, august, and, the, hottest, time, of, the, day, from, 1, pm, are, chosen, and, for, the, latter, commencing, in, january, the, pupils, start, wrestling, at, four, o, clock, in, the, morning, and, keep, it, up, until, seven, or, eight, the, summer, practice, is, termed, shochugeiko, and, the, winter, practice, kangeiko, there, is, likewise, the, number, exercise, on, the, last, day, of, the, winter, practice, when, as, a, special, test, of, endurance, the, pupils, practice, from, 4, am, till, 2, pm, and, not, infrequently, go, through, as, many, as, a, hundred, bouts, within, that, interval, during, the, late, 1890s, the, kodokan, moved, two, more, times, first, to, a, 207, mat, space, in, november, 1897, and, then, to, a, 314, mat, space, in, january, 1898, in, 1909, kan, incorporated, the, kodokan, and, endowed, it, with, 10, 000, yen, then, about, us, 4, 700, the, reason, said, japan, times, on, 30, march, 1913, was, so, that, this, wonderful, institution, might, be, able, to, reconstruct, for, that, is, what, it, really, does, the, moral, and, physical, nature, of, the, japanese, youth, without, its, founder, s, personal, attention, the, kodokan, moved, once, again, during, kan, s, lifetime, and, on, 21, march, 1934, the, kodokan, dedicated, this, 510, mat, facility, guests, at, the, opening, included, the, belgian, italian, and, afghan, ambassadors, to, japan, in, 1958, when, the, kodokan, moved, to, its, current, eight, story, facility, that, now, has, more, than, 1200, mats, the, old, building, was, sold, to, the, japan, karate, association, on, 18, april, 1888, kan, and, reverend, thomas, lindsay, presented, a, lecture, called, jiujitsu, the, old, samurai, art, of, fighting, without, weapons, to, the, asiatic, society, of, japan, this, lecture, took, place, at, the, british, embassy, in, tokyo, its, theme, was, that, the, main, principle, of, judo, involved, gaining, victory, by, yielding, to, strength, being, an, idealist, kan, had, broad, aims, for, judo, which, he, saw, as, something, that, simultaneously, encompassed, self, defense, physical, culture, and, moral, behavior, since, the, very, beginning, i, had, been, categorizing, judo, into, three, parts, rentai, ho, shobu, ho, and, shushin, ho, rentai, ho, refers, to, judo, as, a, physical, exercise, while, shobu, ho, is, judo, as, a, martial, art, shushin, ho, is, the, cultivation, of, wisdom, and, virtue, as, well, as, the, study, and, application, of, the, principles, of, judo, in, our, daily, lives, i, therefore, anticipated, that, practitioners, would, develop, their, bodies, in, an, ideal, manner, to, be, outstanding, in, matches, and, also, to, improve, their, wisdom, and, virtue, and, make, the, spirit, of, judo, live, in, their, daily, lives, if, we, consider, judo, first, as, a, physical, exercise, we, should, remember, that, our, bodies, should, not, be, stiff, but, free, quick, and, strong, we, should, be, able, to, move, properly, in, response, to, our, opponent, s, unexpected, attacks, we, should, also, not, forget, to, make, full, use, of, every, opportunity, during, our, practice, to, improve, our, wisdom, and, virtue, these, are, the, ideal, principles, of, my, judo, because, judo, developed, based, on, the, martial, arts, of, the, past, if, the, martial, arts, practitioners, of, the, past, had, things, that, are, of, value, those, who, practice, judo, should, pass, all, those, things, on, among, these, the, samurai, spirit, should, be, celebrated, even, in, today, s, society, in, 1915, kan, gave, this, definition, to, judo, judo, is, the, way, of, the, highest, or, most, efficient, use, of, both, physical, and, mental, energy, through, training, in, the, attack, and, defence, techniques, of, judo, the, practitioner, nurtures, their, physical, and, mental, strength, and, gradually, embodies, the, essence, of, the, way, of, judo, thus, the, ultimate, objective, of, judo, discipline, is, to, be, utilized, as, a, means, to, self, perfection, and, thenceforth, to, make, a, positive, contribution, to, society, in, 1918, kan, added, don, t, think, about, what, to, do, after, you, become, strong, i, have, repeatedly, stressed, that, the, ultimate, goal, of, judo, is, to, perfect, the, self, and, to, make, a, contribution, to, society, in, the, old, days, j, jutsu, practitioners, focused, their, efforts, on, becoming, strong, and, did, not, give, too, much, consideration, to, how, they, could, put, that, strength, to, use, similarly, judo, practitioners, of, today, do, not, make, sufficient, efforts, to, understand, the, ultimate, objective, of, judo, too, much, emphasis, is, placed, on, the, process, rather, than, the, objective, and, many, only, desire, to, become, strong, and, be, able, to, defeat, their, opponents, of, course, i, am, not, negating, the, importance, of, wanting, to, become, strong, or, skilled, however, it, must, be, remembered, that, this, is, just, part, of, the, process, for, a, greater, objective, the, worth, of, all, people, is, dependent, on, how, they, spend, their, life, making, contributions, during, march, 1922, kan, brought, all, this, to, fruition, through, the, introduction, of, the, kodokan, bunkakai, or, kodokan, cultural, association, this, organization, held, its, first, meeting, at, tokyo, s, seiyoken, hotel, on, 5, april, 1922, and, held, its, first, public, lecture, three, days, later, at, the, ymca, hall, in, kanda, the, mottoes, of, the, kodokan, cultural, association, were, good, use, of, spiritual, and, physical, strength, and, prospering, in, common, for, oneself, and, others, although, those, are, literal, translations, the, phrases, were, usually, translated, into, english, as, maximum, efficiency, with, minimum, effort, and, mutual, welfare, and, benefit, the, theories, of, this, organization, were, described, in, some, detail, in, an, article, published, in, an, american, magazine, living, age, in, september, 1922, the, purpose, of, my, talk, is, to, treat, of, judo, as, a, culture, physical, mental, and, moral, but, as, it, is, based, on, the, art, of, attack, and, defense, i, shall, first, explain, what, this, judo, of, the, contest, is, a, main, feature, of, the, art, is, the, application, of, the, principles, of, non, resistance, and, taking, advantage, of, the, opponent, s, loss, of, equilibrium, hence, the, name, j, jutsu, literally, soft, or, gentle, art, or, judo, doctrine, of, softness, or, gentleness, of, the, principle, of, the, maximum, efficiency, in, use, of, mind, and, body, on, this, principle, the, whole, fabric, of, the, art, and, science, of, judo, is, constructed, judo, is, taught, under, two, methods, one, called, randori, and, the, other, kata, randori, or, free, exercise, is, practised, under, conditions, of, actual, contest, it, includes, throwing, choking, holding, down, and, bending, or, twisting, the, opponent, s, arms, or, legs, the, combatants, may, use, whatever, tricks, they, like, provided, they, do, not, hurt, each, other, and, obey, the, general, rules, of, judo, etiquette, kata, which, literally, means, form, is, a, formal, system, of, prearranged, exercises, including, besides, the, aforementioned, actions, hitting, and, kicking, and, the, use, of, weapons, according, to, rules, under, which, each, combatant, knows, beforehand, exactly, what, his, opponent, is, going, to, do, the, use, of, weapons, and, hitting, and, kicking, is, taught, in, kata, and, not, in, randori, because, if, these, practices, were, resorted, to, in, randori, injury, might, well, arise, as, to, the, moral, phase, of, judo, not, to, speak, of, the, discipline, of, the, exercise, room, involving, the, observance, of, the, regular, rules, of, etiquette, courage, and, perseverance, kindness, to, and, respect, for, others, impartiality, and, fair, play, so, much, emphasized, in, western, athletic, training, judo, has, special, importance, in, japan, although, kan, promoted, judo, whenever, he, could, he, earned, his, living, as, an, educator, kan, entered, tokyo, imperial, university, during, june, 1877, he, majored, in, political, science, and, economics, which, at, that, time, were, taught, by, the, department, of, aesthetics, and, morals, he, graduated, in, july, 1882, and, the, following, month, he, began, work, as, a, professor, fourth, class, at, the, gakushuin, or, peers, school, in, tokyo, in, 1883, kan, was, appointed, professor, of, economics, at, komaba, agricultural, college, now, the, faculty, of, agriculture, at, university, of, tokyo, but, during, april, 1885, he, returned, to, gakushuin, with, the, position, of, principal, in, january, 1891, kan, was, appointed, to, a, position, at, the, ministry, of, education, in, august, 1891, he, gave, up, this, position, to, become, a, dean, at, the, fifth, higher, normal, school, present, day, kumamoto, university, one, of, the, teachers, at, fifth, higher, between, 1891, and, 1893, was, lafcadio, hearn, around, this, same, time, kan, married, his, wife, sumako, takezoe, was, the, daughter, of, a, former, japanese, ambassador, to, korea, eventually, the, couple, had, six, daughters, and, three, sons, during, the, summer, of, 1892, kan, went, to, shanghai, to, help, establish, a, program, that, would, allow, chinese, students, to, study, in, japan, kan, revisited, shanghai, during, 1905, 1915, and, 1921, in, january, 1898, kan, was, appointed, director, of, primary, education, at, the, ministry, of, education, and, in, august, 1899, he, received, a, grant, that, allowed, him, to, study, in, europe, his, ship, left, yokohama, on, 13, september, 1899, and, he, arrived, in, marseilles,

establish, nada, middle, high, school, in, 1928, at, kobe, which, later, became, one, of, highest, ranked, private, high, schools, in, japan, considering, that, he, majored, in, political, science, and, economics, kan, s, family, thought, that, after, graduating, from, university, he, would, pursue, a, career, in, some, government, ministry, indeed, through, influential, friends, of, his, father, s, he, was, initially, offered, a, position, with, the, ministry, of, finance, however, his, love, for, teaching, led, him, instead, to, accept, a, position, teaching, at, gakushuin, the, students, of, japan, s, elite, attended, gakushuin, and, were, of, higher, social, positions, than, their, teachers, the, students, were, allowed, to, ride, in, rickshaws, jinrikisha, right, to, the, doors, of, the, classes, whereas, teachers, were, forbidden, the, teachers, often, felt, compelled, to, visit, the, homes, of, these, students, whenever, summoned, to, give, instruction, or, advice, in, effect, the, teachers, were, treated, as, servants, kan, believed, this, to, be, unacceptable, he, refused, to, play, such, a, subservient, role, when, teaching, his, students, to, kan, a, teacher, must, command, respect, at, the, same, time, he, employed, the, latest, european, and, american, pedagogical, methods, the, theories, of, the, american, educator, john, dewey, especially, influenced, him, kan, s, manner, had, the, desired, effect, upon, the, students, but, the, administration, was, slower, to, warm, to, his, methods, and, it, was, not, until, the, arrival, of, a, new, principal, that, kan, s, ideas, found, acceptance, all, this, is, to, say, that, kan, s, educational, philosophy, was, a, combination, of, both, traditional, japanese, neo, confucianism, and, contemporary, european, and, american, philosophies, to, include, instrumentalism, utilitarianism, and, evolutionary, progressivism, as, social, darwinism, was, then, known, the, goals, of, kan, s, educational, philosophies, and, methods, indeed, the, goals, of, most, japanese, educational, programs, of, the, early, 20th, century, were, to, develop, minds, bodies, and, spirits, in, equal, proportion, to, increase, patriotism, and, loyalty, especially, to, the, emperor, to, teach, public, morality, and, to, increase, physical, strength, and, stamina, especially, for, the, purpose, of, making, young, men, more, fit, for, military, service, calisthenics, especially, as, done, in, the, huge, formations, favored, at, the, time, could, be, boring, and, at, the, high, school, and, college, levels, games, such, as, baseball, and, rugby, were, more, often, spectator, sports, than, a, practical, source, of, physical, exercise, for, the, masses, moreover, at, elite, levels, baseball, football, and, even, judo, did, not, put, much, emphasis, on, moral, or, intellectual, development, instead, elite, coaches, and, athletes, tended, to, emphasize, winning, at, almost, any, cost, for, kan, the, answer, to, this, conundrum, was, one, word, judo, not, judo, in, the, sense, of, simply, throwing, other, people, around, and, definitely, not, judo, in, the, sense, of, winning, at, any, cost, instead, it, was, judo, in, the, sense, of, maximum, efficiency, with, minimum, effort, and, mutual, welfare, and, benefit, or, as, kan, himself, put, it, to, a, reporter, in, 1938, when, yielding, is, the, highest, efficient, use, of, energy, then, yielding, is, judo, kan, became, active, in, the, work, of, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, in, 1909, this, came, about, after, kristian, hellstr, m, of, the, swedish, olympic, committee, wrote, to, the, governments, of, japan, and, china, to, ask, if, they, were, going, to, send, teams, to, the, 1912, olympics, the, japanese, government, did, not, want, to, embarrass, itself, on, an, international, stage, by, saying, no, so, the, ministry, of, education, was, told, to, look, into, this, the, ministry, logically, turned, to, kan, who, was, a, physical, educator, with, recent, experience, in, europe, kan, agreed, to, represent, japan, at, the, international, olympic, committee, and, after, talking, to, the, french, ambassador, to, japan, and, reading, pamphlets, sent, by, the, swedes, developed, in, his, words, a, fairly, good, idea, of, what, the, olympic, games, were, toward, fulfilling, his, duties, as, a, member, in, 1912, kan, helped, establish, the, japan, amateur, athletic, association, dai, nippon, tai, iku, kyokai, which, had, the, mission, of, overseeing, amateur, sport, in, japan, kan, was, the, official, representative, of, japan, to, the, olympics, in, stockholm, in, 1912, and, he, was, involved, in, organizing, the, far, eastern, championship, games, held, in, osaka, during, may, 1917, in, 1920, kan, represented, japan, at, the, antwerp, olympics, and, during, the, early, 1920s, he, served, on, the, japanese, council, of, physical, education, he, did, not, play, much, part, in, organizing, the, far, eastern, championship, games, held, in, osaka, in, may, 1923, nor, did, he, attend, the, 1924, olympics, in, paris, but, he, did, represent, japan, at, the, olympics, in, amsterdam, 1928, los, angeles, 1932, and, berlin, 1936, from, 1931, to, 1938, he, was, also, one, of, the, leading, international, spokesmen, in, japan, s, bid, for, the, 1940, olympics, kan, s, chief, goal, in, all, this, was, in, his, words, to, gather, people, together, for, a, common, cause, with, friendly, feeling, his, goals, did, not, however, particularly, involve, getting, judo, into, the, olympics, as, he, put, it, in, a, letter, to, britain, s, gunji, koizumi, in, 1936, i, have, been, asked, by, people, of, various, sections, as, to, the, wisdom, and, the, possibility, of, judo, being, introduced, at, the, olympic, games, my, view, on, the, matter, at, present, is, rather, passive, if, it, be, the, desire, of, other, member, countries, i, have, no, objection, but, i, do, not, feel, inclined, to, take, any, initiative, for, one, thing, judo, in, reality, is, not, a, mere, sport, or, game, i, regard, it, as, a, principle, of, life, art, and, science, in, fact, it, is, a, means, for, personal, cultural, attainment, only, one, of, the, forms, of, judo, training, the, so, called, randori, can, be, classed, as, a, form, of, sport, olympic, games, are, so, strongly, flavoured, with, nationalism, that, it, is, possible, to, be, influenced, by, it, and, to, develop, contest, judo, as, a, retrograde, form, as, jujitsu, was, before, the, kodokan, was, founded, judo, should, be, as, free, as, art, and, science, from, external, influences, political, national, racial, financial, or, any, other, organised, interest, and, all, things, connected, with, it, should, be, directed, to, its, ultimate, object, the, benefit, of, humanity, in, 1934, kan, stopped, giving, public, exhibitions, the, reason, was, his, failing, health, probably, compounded, by, kidney, stones, the, british, judoka, sarah, mayer, wrote, people, don, t, seem, to, think, he, will, live, much, longer, to, his, friends, in, london, nevertheless, kan, continued, attending, important, kodokan, events, such, as, kagami, biraki, new, years, ceremonies, whenever, he, could, and, he, continued, participating, in, olympics, business, in, may, 1938, kan, died, at, sea, during, a, voyage, that, he, made, as, member, of, the, ioc, on, board, the, nyk, line, motor, ship, hikawa, maru, because, the, japanese, merchant, fleet, of, the, 1930s, used, tokyo, time, wherever, it, was, in, the, world, the, japanese, date, of, death, was, 4, may, 1938, at, about, 5, 33, am, jst, whereas, the, international, date, of, death, was, 3, may, 1938, at, 20, 33, utc, the, cause, of, death, was, officially, listed, as, pneumonia, but, other, sources, list, food, poisoning, as, the, cause, of, death, during, the, 1990s, there, appeared, allegations, that, kan, was, murdered, by, poisoning, rather, than, dying, of, pneumonia, although, there, is, no, known, contemporary, documentation, to, support, this, claim, kan, s, opposition, to, japanese, militarism, was, well, known, and, many, others, who, also, opposed, it, were, allegedly, assassinated, judo, did, not, die, with, kan, instead, during, the, 1950s, judo, clubs, sprang, up, throughout, the, world, and, in, 1964, judo, was, introduced, as, an, olympic, sport, when, tokyo, eventually, hosted, the, 1964, summer, olympics, and, was, reintroduced, for, good, at, the, 1972, summer, olympics, kan, s, posthumous, reputation, was, therefore, assured, nonetheless, his, true, legacy, was, his, idealism, as, kan, said, in, a, speech, given, in, 1934, nothing, under, the, sun, is, greater, than, education, by, educating, one, person, and, sending, him, into, the, society, of, his, generation, we, make, a, contribution, extending, a, hundred, generations, to, come, kan, has, also, been, compared, to, the, 9th, marquess, of, queensberry, in, the, way, his, legacy, left, a, whole, new, set, of, rules, dr, kano, s, kodokan, rules, for, his, version, of, jujitsu, brought, a, new, safer, kind, of, fighting, to, japan, in, the, same, way, that, the, queensberry, rules, introduced, some, two, decades, earlier, in, 1867, did, for, boxing, in, england, both, the, marquess, of, queensberry, and, dr, kano, transformed, their, sports, making, them, cleaner, and, safer, one, man, took, the, grappling, out, of, boxing, the, other, took, the, boxing, out, of, grappling, one, worked, with, a, padded, fist, the, other, with, a, padded, floor, in, the, latter, years, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, martial, histories, of, eastern, and, western, civilisation, had, reached, a, point, at, which, two, men, at, opposite, ends, of, the, globe, produced, within, a, few, years, of, each, other, the, rules, which, were, to, herald, unarmed, combat, s, own, age, of, enlightenment
