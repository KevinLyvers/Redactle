joseph, maurice, ravel, 7, march, 1875, 28, december, 1937, was, a, french, composer, pianist, and, conductor, he, is, often, associated, with, impressionism, along, with, his, elder, contemporary, claude, debussy, although, both, composers, rejected, the, term, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, ravel, was, internationally, regarded, as, france, s, greatest, living, composer, born, to, a, music, loving, family, ravel, attended, france, s, premier, music, college, the, paris, conservatoire, he, was, not, well, regarded, by, its, conservative, establishment, whose, biased, treatment, of, him, caused, a, scandal, after, leaving, the, conservatoire, ravel, found, his, own, way, as, a, composer, developing, a, style, of, great, clarity, and, incorporating, elements, of, modernism, baroque, neoclassicism, and, in, his, later, works, jazz, he, liked, to, experiment, with, musical, form, as, in, his, best, known, work, bol, ro, 1928, in, which, repetition, takes, the, place, of, development, renowned, for, his, abilities, in, orchestration, ravel, made, some, orchestral, arrangements, of, other, composers, piano, music, of, which, his, 1922, version, of, mussorgsky, s, pictures, at, an, exhibition, is, the, best, known, a, slow, and, painstaking, worker, ravel, composed, fewer, pieces, than, many, of, his, contemporaries, among, his, works, to, enter, the, repertoire, are, pieces, for, piano, chamber, music, two, piano, concertos, ballet, music, two, operas, and, eight, song, cycles, he, wrote, no, symphonies, or, church, music, many, of, his, works, exist, in, two, versions, first, a, piano, score, and, later, an, orchestration, some, of, his, piano, music, such, as, gaspard, de, la, nuit, 1908, is, exceptionally, difficult, to, play, and, his, complex, orchestral, works, such, as, daphnis, et, chlo, 1912, require, skilful, balance, in, performance, ravel, was, among, the, first, composers, to, recognise, the, potential, of, recording, to, bring, their, music, to, a, wider, public, from, the, 1920s, despite, limited, technique, as, a, pianist, or, conductor, he, took, part, in, recordings, of, several, of, his, works, others, were, made, under, his, supervision, ravel, was, born, in, the, basque, town, of, ciboure, france, near, biarritz, 18, kilometres, 11, mi, from, the, spanish, border, his, father, pierre, joseph, ravel, was, an, educated, and, successful, engineer, inventor, and, manufacturer, born, in, versoix, near, the, franco, swiss, border, his, mother, marie, n, e, delouart, was, basque, but, had, grown, up, in, madrid, in, 19th, century, terms, joseph, had, married, beneath, his, status, marie, was, illegitimate, and, barely, literate, but, the, marriage, was, a, happy, one, some, of, joseph, s, inventions, were, successful, including, an, early, internal, combustion, engine, and, a, notorious, circus, machine, the, whirlwind, of, death, an, automotive, loop, the, loop, that, was, a, major, attraction, until, a, fatal, accident, at, barnum, and, bailey, s, circus, in, 1903, both, ravel, s, parents, were, roman, catholics, marie, was, also, something, of, a, free, thinker, a, trait, inherited, by, her, elder, son, he, was, baptised, in, the, ciboure, parish, church, six, days, after, he, was, born, the, family, moved, to, paris, three, months, later, and, there, a, younger, son, douard, was, born, he, was, close, to, his, father, whom, he, eventually, followed, into, the, engineering, profession, maurice, was, particularly, devoted, to, their, mother, her, basque, spanish, heritage, was, a, strong, influence, on, his, life, and, music, among, his, earliest, memories, were, folk, songs, she, sang, to, him, the, household, was, not, rich, but, the, family, was, comfortable, and, the, two, boys, had, happy, childhoods, ravel, senior, delighted, in, taking, his, sons, to, factories, to, see, the, latest, mechanical, devices, but, he, also, had, a, keen, interest, in, music, and, culture, in, general, in, later, life, ravel, recalled, throughout, my, childhood, i, was, sensitive, to, music, my, father, much, better, educated, in, this, art, than, most, amateurs, are, knew, how, to, develop, my, taste, and, to, stimulate, my, enthusiasm, at, an, early, age, there, is, no, record, that, ravel, received, any, formal, general, schooling, in, his, early, years, his, biographer, roger, nichols, suggests, that, the, boy, may, have, been, chiefly, educated, by, his, father, when, he, was, seven, ravel, started, piano, lessons, with, henri, ghys, a, friend, of, emmanuel, chabrier, five, years, later, in, 1887, he, began, studying, harmony, counterpoint, and, composition, with, charles, ren, a, pupil, of, l, o, delibes, without, being, anything, of, a, child, prodigy, he, was, a, highly, musical, boy, charles, ren, found, that, ravel, s, conception, of, music, was, natural, to, him, and, not, as, in, the, case, of, so, many, others, the, result, of, effort, ravel, s, earliest, known, compositions, date, from, this, period, variations, on, a, chorale, by, schumann, variations, on, a, theme, by, grieg, and, a, single, movement, of, a, piano, sonata, they, survive, only, in, fragmentary, form, in, 1888, ravel, met, the, young, pianist, ricardo, vi, es, who, became, not, only, a, lifelong, friend, but, also, one, of, the, foremost, interpreters, of, his, works, and, an, important, link, between, ravel, and, spanish, music, the, two, shared, an, appreciation, of, wagner, russian, music, and, the, writings, of, poe, baudelaire, and, mallarm, at, the, exposition, universelle, in, paris, in, 1889, ravel, was, much, struck, by, the, new, russian, works, conducted, by, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, this, music, had, a, lasting, effect, on, both, ravel, and, his, older, contemporary, claude, debussy, as, did, the, exotic, sound, of, the, javanese, gamelan, also, heard, during, the, exposition, mile, decombes, took, over, as, ravel, s, piano, teacher, in, 1889, in, the, same, year, ravel, gave, his, earliest, public, performance, aged, fourteen, he, took, part, in, a, concert, at, the, salle, rard, along, with, other, pupils, of, decombes, including, reynaldo, hahn, and, alfred, cortot, with, the, encouragement, of, his, parents, ravel, applied, for, entry, to, france, s, most, important, musical, college, the, conservatoire, de, paris, in, november, 1889, playing, music, by, chopin, he, passed, the, examination, for, admission, to, the, preparatory, piano, class, run, by, eug, ne, anthiome, ravel, won, the, first, prize, in, the, conservatoire, s, piano, competition, in, 1891, but, otherwise, he, did, not, stand, out, as, a, student, nevertheless, these, years, were, a, time, of, considerable, advance, in, his, development, as, a, composer, the, musicologist, arbie, orenstein, writes, that, for, ravel, the, 1890s, were, a, period, of, immense, growth, from, adolescence, to, maturity, in, 1891, ravel, progressed, to, the, classes, of, charles, wilfrid, de, b, riot, for, piano, and, mile, pessard, for, harmony, he, made, solid, unspectacular, progress, with, particular, encouragement, from, b, riot, but, in, the, words, of, the, musicologist, barbara, l, kelly, he, was, only, teachable, on, his, own, terms, his, later, teacher, gabriel, faur, understood, this, but, it, was, not, generally, acceptable, to, the, conservative, faculty, of, the, conservatoire, of, the, 1890s, ravel, was, expelled, in, 1895, having, won, no, more, prizes, his, earliest, works, to, survive, in, full, are, from, these, student, days, s, r, nade, grotesque, for, piano, and, ballade, de, la, reine, morte, d, aimer, a, m, lodie, setting, a, poem, by, roland, de, mar, s, both, 1893, ravel, was, never, so, assiduous, a, student, of, the, piano, as, his, colleagues, such, as, vi, es, and, cortot, were, it, was, plain, that, as, a, pianist, he, would, never, match, them, and, his, overriding, ambition, was, to, be, a, composer, from, this, point, he, concentrated, on, composition, his, works, from, the, period, include, the, songs, un, grand, sommeil, noir, and, d, anne, jouant, de, l, espinette, to, words, by, paul, verlaine, and, cl, ment, marot, and, the, piano, pieces, menuet, antique, and, habanera, for, four, hands, the, latter, eventually, incorporated, into, the, rapsodie, espagnole, at, around, this, time, joseph, ravel, introduced, his, son, to, erik, satie, who, was, earning, a, living, as, a, caf, pianist, ravel, was, one, of, the, first, musicians, debussy, was, another, who, recognised, satie, s, originality, and, talent, satie, s, constant, experiments, in, musical, form, were, an, inspiration, to, ravel, who, counted, them, of, inestimable, value, in, 1897, ravel, was, readmitted, to, the, conservatoire, studying, composition, with, faur, and, taking, private, lessons, in, counterpoint, with, andr, gedalge, both, these, teachers, particularly, faur, regarded, him, highly, and, were, key, influences, on, his, development, as, a, composer, as, ravel, s, course, progressed, faur, reported, a, distinct, gain, in, maturity, engaging, wealth, of, imagination, ravel, s, standing, at, the, conservatoire, was, nevertheless, undermined, by, the, hostility, of, the, director, th, odore, dubois, who, deplored, the, young, man, s, musically, and, politically, progressive, outlook, consequently, according, to, a, fellow, student, michel, dimitri, calvocoressi, he, was, a, marked, man, against, whom, all, weapons, were, good, he, wrote, some, substantial, works, while, studying, with, faur, including, the, overture, sh, h, razade, and, a, single, movement, violin, sonata, but, he, won, no, prizes, and, therefore, was, expelled, again, in, 1900, as, a, former, student, he, was, allowed, to, attend, faur, s, classes, as, a, non, participating, auditeur, until, finally, abandoning, the, conservatoire, in, 1903, in, may, 1897, ravel, conducted, the, first, performance, of, the, sh, h, razade, overture, which, had, a, mixed, reception, with, boos, mingling, with, applause, from, the, audience, and, unflattering, reviews, from, the, critics, one, described, the, piece, as, a, jolting, debut, a, clumsy, plagiarism, of, the, russian, school, and, called, ravel, a, mediocrely, gifted, debutant, who, will, perhaps, become, something, if, not, someone, in, about, ten, years, if, he, works, hard, another, critic, pierre, lalo, thought, that, ravel, showed, talent, but, was, too, indebted, to, debussy, and, should, instead, emulate, beethoven, over, the, succeeding, decades, lalo, became, ravel, s, most, implacable, critic, in, 1899, ravel, composed, his, first, piece, to, become, widely, known, though, it, made, little, impact, initially, pavane, pour, une, infante, d, funte, pavane, for, a, dead, princess, it, was, originally, a, solo, piano, work, commissioned, by, the, princesse, de, polignac, from, the, start, of, his, career, ravel, appeared, calmly, indifferent, to, blame, or, praise, those, who, knew, him, well, believed, that, this, was, no, pose, but, wholly, genuine, the, only, opinion, of, his, music, that, he, truly, valued, was, his, own, perfectionist, and, severely, self, critical, at, twenty, years, of, age, he, was, in, the, words, of, the, biographer, burnett, james, self, possessed, a, little, aloof, intellectually, biased, given, to, mild, banter, he, dressed, like, a, dandy, and, was, meticulous, about, his, appearance, and, demeanour, orenstein, comments, that, short, in, stature, light, in, frame, and, bony, in, features, ravel, had, the, appearance, of, a, well, dressed, jockey, whose, large, head, seemed, suitably, matched, to, his, formidable, intellect, during, the, late, 1890s, and, into, the, early, years, of, the, next, century, ravel, was, bearded, in, the, fashion, of, the, day, from, his, mid, thirties, he, was, clean, shaven, around, 1900, ravel, and, a, number, of, innovative, young, artists, poets, critics, and, musicians, joined, together, in, an, informal, group, they, came, to, be, known, as, les, apaches, the, hooligans, a, name, coined, by, vi, es, to, represent, their, status, as, artistic, outcasts, they, met, regularly, until, the, beginning, of, the, first, world, war, and, members, stimulated, one, another, with, intellectual, argument, and, performances, of, their, works, the, membership, of, the, group, was, fluid, and, at, various, times, included, igor, stravinsky, and, manuel, de, falla, as, well, as, their, french, friends, among, the, enthusiasms, of, the, apaches, was, the, music, of, debussy, ravel, twelve, years, his, junior, had, known, debussy, slightly, since, the, 1890s, and, their, friendship, though, never, close, continued, for, more, than, ten, years, in, 1902, andr, messager, conducted, the, premiere, of, debussy, s, opera, pell, as, et, m, lisande, at, the, op, ra, comique, it, divided, musical, opinion, dubois, unavailingly, forbade, conservatoire, students, to, attend, and, the, conductor, s, friend, and, former, teacher, camille, saint, sa, ns, was, prominent, among, those, who, detested, the, piece, the, apaches, were, loud, in, their, support, the, first, run, of, the, opera, consisted, of, fourteen, performances, ravel, attended, all, of, them, debussy, was, widely, held, to, be, an, impressionist, composer, a, label, he, intensely, disliked, many, music, lovers, began, to, apply, the, same, term, to, ravel, and, the, works, of, the, two, composers, were, frequently, taken, as, part, of, a, single, genre, ravel, thought, that, debussy, was, indeed, an, impressionist, but, that, he, himself, was, not, orenstein, comments, that, debussy, was, more, spontaneous, and, casual, in, his, composing, while, ravel, was, more, attentive, to, form, and, craftsmanship, ravel, wrote, that, debussy, s, genius, was, obviously, one, of, great, individuality, creating, its, own, laws, constantly, in, evolution, expressing, itself, freely, yet, always, faithful, to, french, tradition, for, debussy, the, musician, and, the, man, i, have, had, profound, admiration, but, by, nature, i, am, different, from, debussy, i, think, i, have, always, personally, followed, a, direction, opposed, to, that, of, symbolism, during, the, first, years, of, the, new, century, ravel, s, new, works, included, the, piano, piece, jeux, d, eau, 1901, the, string, quartet, and, the, orchestral, song, cycle, sh, h, razade, both, 1903, commentators, have, noted, some, debussian, touches, in, some, parts, of, these, works, nichols, calls, the, quartet, at, once, homage, to, and, exorcism, of, debussy, s, influence, the, two, composers, ceased, to, be, on, friendly, terms, in, the, middle, of, the, first, decade, of, the, 1900s, for, musical, and, possibly, personal, reasons, their, admirers, began, to, form, factions, with, adherents, of, one, composer, denigrating, the, other, disputes, arose, about, the, chronology, of, the, composers, works, and, who, influenced, whom, prominent, in, the, anti, ravel, camp, was, lalo, who, wrote, where, m, debussy, is, all, sensitivity, m, ravel, is, all, insensitivity, borrowing, without, hesitation, not, only, technique, but, the, sensitivity, of, other, people, the, public, tension, led, to, personal, estrangement, ravel, said, it, s, probably, better, for, us, after, all, to, be, on, frigid, terms, for, illogical, reasons, nichols, suggests, an, additional, reason, for, the, rift, in, 1904, debussy, left, his, wife, and, went, to, live, with, the, singer, emma, bardac, ravel, together, with, his, close, friend, and, confidante, misia, edwards, and, the, opera, star, lucienne, br, val, contributed, to, a, modest, regular, income, for, the, deserted, lilly, debussy, a, fact, that, nichols, suggests, may, have, rankled, with, her, husband, during, the, first, years, of, the, new, century, ravel, made, five, attempts, to, win, france, s, most, prestigious, prize, for, young, composers, the, prix, de, rome, past, winners, of, which, included, berlioz, gounod, bizet, massenet, and, debussy, in, 1900, ravel, was, eliminated, in, the, first, round, in, 1901, he, won, the, second, prize, for, the, competition, in, 1902, and, 1903, he, won, nothing, according, to, the, musicologist, paul, landormy, the, judges, suspected, ravel, of, making, fun, of, them, by, submitting, cantatas, so, academic, as, to, seem, like, parodies, in, 1905, ravel, by, now, thirty, competed, for, the, last, time, inadvertently, causing, a, furore, he, was, eliminated, in, the, first, round, which, even, critics, unsympathetic, to, his, music, including, lalo, denounced, as, unjustifiable, the, press, s, indignation, grew, when, it, emerged, that, the, senior, professor, at, the, conservatoire, charles, lenepveu, was, on, the, jury, and, only, his, students, were, selected, for, the, final, round, his, insistence, that, this, was, pure, coincidence, was, not, well, received, l, affaire, ravel, became, a, national, scandal, leading, to, the, early, retirement, of, dubois, and, his, replacement, by, faur, appointed, by, the, government, to, carry, out, a, radical, reorganisation, of, the, conservatoire, among, those, taking, a, close, interest, in, the, controversy, was, alfred, edwards, owner, and, editor, of, le, matin, for, which, lalo, wrote, edwards, was, married, to, ravel, s, friend, misia, the, couple, took, ravel, on, a, seven, week, rhine, cruise, on, their, yacht, in, june, and, july, 1905, the, first, time, he, had, travelled, abroad, by, the, latter, part, of, the, 1900s, ravel, had, established, a, pattern, of, writing, works, for, piano, and, subsequently, arranging, them, for, full, orchestra, he, was, in, general, a, slow, and, painstaking, worker, and, reworking, his, earlier, piano, compositions, enabled, him, to, increase, the, number, of, pieces, published, and, performed, there, appears, to, have, been, no, mercenary, motive, for, this, ravel, was, known, for, his, indifference, to, financial, matters, the, pieces, that, began, as, piano, compositions, and, were, then, given, orchestral, dress, were, pavane, pour, une, infante, d, funte, orchestrated, 1910, une, barque, sur, l, oc, an, 1906, from, the, 1905, piano, suite, miroirs, the, habanera, section, of, rapsodie, espagnole, 1907, 08, ma, m, re, l, oye, 1908, 10, orchestrated, 1911, valses, nobles, et, sentimentales, 1911, orchestrated, 1912, alborada, del, gracioso, from, miroirs, orchestrated, 1918, and, le, tombeau, de, couperin, 1914, 17, orchestrated, 1919, ravel, was, not, by, inclination, a, teacher, but, he, gave, lessons, to, a, few, young, musicians, he, felt, could, benefit, from, them, manuel, rosenthal, was, one, and, records, that, ravel, was, a, very, demanding, teacher, when, he, thought, his, pupil, had, talent, like, his, own, teacher, faur, he, was, concerned, that, his, pupils, should, find, their, own, individual, voices, and, not, be, excessively, influenced, by, established, masters, he, warned, rosenthal, that, it, was, impossible, to, learn, from, studying, debussy, s, music, only, debussy, could, have, written, it, and, made, it, sound, like, only, debussy, can, sound, when, george, gershwin, asked, him, for, lessons, in, the, 1920s, ravel, after, serious, consideration, refused, on, the, grounds, that, they, would, probably, cause, him, to, write, bad, ravel, and, lose, his, great, gift, of, melody, and, spontaneity, the, best, known, composer, who, studied, with, ravel, was, probably, ralph, vaughan, williams, who, was, his, pupil, for, three, months, in, 1907, 08, vaughan, williams, recalled, that, ravel, helped, him, escape, from, the, heavy, contrapuntal, teutonic, manner, complexe, mais, pas, compliqu, was, his, motto, vaughan, williams, s, recollections, throw, some, light, on, ravel, s, private, life, about, which, the, latter, s, reserved, and, secretive, personality, has, led, to, much, speculation, vaughan, williams, rosenthal, and, marguerite, long, have, all, recorded, that, ravel, frequented, brothels, long, attributed, this, to, his, self, consciousness, about, his, diminutive, stature, and, consequent, lack, of, confidence, with, women, by, other, accounts, none, of, them, first, hand, ravel, was, in, love, with, misia, edwards, or, wanted, to, marry, the, violinist, h, l, ne, jourdan, morhange, rosenthal, records, and, discounts, contemporary, speculation, that, ravel, a, lifelong, bachelor, may, have, been, homosexual, such, speculation, recurred, in, a, 2000, life, of, ravel, by, benjamin, ivry, subsequent, studies, have, concluded, that, ravel, s, sexuality, and, personal, life, remain, a, mystery, ravel, s, first, concert, outside, france, was, in, 1909, as, the, guest, of, the, vaughan, williamses, he, visited, london, where, he, played, for, the, soci, t, des, concerts, fran, ais, gaining, favourable, reviews, and, enhancing, his, growing, international, reputation, the, soci, t, nationale, de, musique, founded, in, 1871, to, promote, the, music, of, rising, french, composers, had, been, dominated, since, the, mid, 1880s, by, a, conservative, faction, led, by, vincent, d, indy, ravel, together, with, several, other, former, pupils, of, faur, set, up, a, new, modernist, organisation, the, soci, t, musicale, ind, pendente, with, faur, as, its, president, the, new, society, s, inaugural, concert, took, place, on, 20, april, 1910, the, seven, items, on, the, programme, included, premieres, of, faur, s, song, cycle, la, chanson, d, ve, debussy, s, piano, suite, d, un, cahier, d, esquisses, zolt, n, kod, ly, s, six, pi, ces, pour, piano, and, the, original, piano, duet, version, of, ravel, s, ma, m, re, l, oye, the, performers, included, faur, florent, schmitt, ernest, bloch, pierre, monteux, and, in, the, debussy, work, ravel, kelly, considers, it, a, sign, of, ravel, s, new, influence, that, the, society, featured, satie, s, music, in, a, concert, in, january, 1911, the, first, of, ravel, s, two, operas, the, one, act, comedy, l, heure, espagnole, was, premiered, in, 1911, the, work, had, been, completed, in, 1907, but, the, manager, of, the, op, ra, comique, albert, carr, repeatedly, deferred, its, presentation, he, was, concerned, that, its, plot, a, bedroom, farce, would, be, badly, received, by, the, ultra, respectable, mothers, and, daughters, who, were, an, important, part, of, the, op, ra, comique, s, audience, the, piece, was, only, modestly, successful, at, its, first, production, and, it, was, not, until, the, 1920s, that, it, became, popular, in, 1912, ravel, had, three, ballets, premiered, the, first, to, the, orchestrated, and, expanded, version, of, ma, m, re, l, oye, opened, at, the, th, tre, des, arts, in, january, the, reviews, were, excellent, the, mercure, de, france, called, the, score, absolutely, ravishing, a, masterwork, in, miniature, the, music, rapidly, entered, the, concert, repertoire, it, was, played, at, the, queen, s, hall, london, within, weeks, of, the, paris, premiere, and, was, repeated, at, the, proms, later, in, the, same, year, the, times, praised, the, enchantment, of, the, work, the, effect, of, mirage, by, which, something, quite, real, seems, to, float, on, nothing, new, york, audiences, heard, the, work, in, the, same, year, ravel, s, second, ballet, of, 1912, was, ad, la, de, ou, le, langage, des, fleurs, danced, to, the, score, of, valses, nobles, et, sentimentales, which, opened, at, the, ch, telet, in, april, daphnis, et, chlo, opened, at, the, same, theatre, in, june, this, was, his, largest, scale, orchestral, work, and, took, him, immense, trouble, and, several, years, to, complete, daphnis, et, chlo, was, commissioned, in, or, about, 1909, by, the, impresario, sergei, diaghilev, for, his, company, the, ballets, russes, ravel, began, work, with, diaghilev, s, choreographer, michel, fokine, and, designer, l, on, bakst, fokine, had, a, reputation, for, his, modern, approach, to, dance, with, individual, numbers, replaced, by, continuous, music, this, appealed, to, ravel, and, after, discussing, the, action, in, great, detail, with, fokine, ravel, began, composing, the, music, there, were, frequent, disagreements, between, the, collaborators, and, the, premiere, was, under, rehearsed, because, of, the, late, completion, of, the, work, it, had, an, unenthusiastic, reception, and, was, quickly, withdrawn, although, it, was, revived, successfully, a, year, later, in, monte, carlo, and, london, the, effort, to, complete, the, ballet, took, its, toll, on, ravel, s, health, neurasthenia, obliged, him, to, rest, for, several, months, after, the, premiere, ravel, composed, little, during, 1913, he, collaborated, with, stravinsky, on, a, performing, version, of, mussorgsky, s, unfinished, opera, khovanshchina, and, his, own, works, were, the, trois, po, mes, de, mallarm, for, soprano, and, chamber, ensemble, and, two, short, piano, pieces, la, mani, re, de, borodine, and, la, mani, re, de, chabrier, in, 1913, together, with, debussy, ravel, was, among, the, musicians, present, at, the, dress, rehearsal, of, the, rite, of, spring, stravinsky, later, said, that, ravel, was, the, only, person, who, immediately, understood, the, music, ravel, predicted, that, the, premiere, of, the, rite, would, be, seen, as, an, event, of, historic, importance, equal, to, that, of, pell, as, et, m, lisande, when, germany, invaded, france, in, 1914, ravel, tried, to, join, the, french, air, force, he, considered, his, small, stature, and, light, weight, ideal, for, an, aviator, but, was, rejected, because, of, his, age, and, a, minor, heart, complaint, while, waiting, to, be, enlisted, ravel, composed, trois, chansons, his, only, work, for, a, cappella, choir, setting, his, own, texts, in, the, tradition, of, french, 16th, century, chansons, he, dedicated, the, three, songs, to, people, who, might, help, him, to, enlist, after, several, unsuccessful, attempts, to, enlist, ravel, finally, joined, the, thirteenth, artillery, regiment, as, a, lorry, driver, in, march, 1915, when, he, was, forty, stravinsky, expressed, admiration, for, his, friend, s, courage, at, his, age, and, with, his, name, he, could, have, had, an, easier, place, or, done, nothing, some, of, ravel, s, duties, put, him, in, mortal, danger, driving, munitions, at, night, under, heavy, german, bombardment, at, the, same, time, his, peace, of, mind, was, undermined, by, his, mother, s, failing, health, his, own, health, also, deteriorated, he, suffered, from, insomnia, and, digestive, problems, underwent, a, bowel, operation, following, amoebic, dysentery, in, september, 1916, and, had, frostbite, in, his, feet, the, following, winter, during, the, war, the, ligue, nationale, pour, la, defense, de, la, musique, fran, aise, was, formed, by, saint, sa, ns, dubois, d, indy, and, others, campaigning, for, a, ban, on, the, performance, of, contemporary, german, music, ravel, declined, to, join, telling, the, committee, of, the, league, in, 1916, it, would, be, dangerous, for, french, composers, to, ignore, systematically, the, productions, of, their, foreign, colleagues, and, thus, form, themselves, into, a, sort, of, national, coterie, our, musical, art, which, is, so, rich, at, the, present, time, would, soon, degenerate, becoming, isolated, in, banal, formulas, the, league, responded, by, banning, ravel, s, music, from, its, concerts, ravel, s, mother, died, in, january, 1917, and, he, fell, into, a, horrible, despair, compounding, the, distress, he, felt, at, the, suffering, endured, by, the, people, of, his, country, during, the, war, he, composed, few, works, in, the, war, years, the, piano, trio, was, almost, complete, when, the, conflict, began, and, the, most, substantial, of, his, wartime, works, is, le, tombeau, de, couperin, composed, between, 1914, and, 1917, the, suite, celebrates, the, tradition, of, fran, ois, couperin, the, 18th, century, french, composer, each, movement, is, dedicated, to, a, friend, of, ravel, s, who, died, in, the, war, after, the, war, those, close, to, ravel, recognised, that, he, had, lost, much, of, his, physical, and, mental, stamina, as, the, musicologist, stephen, zank, puts, it, ravel, s, emotional, equilibrium, so, hard, won, in, the, previous, decade, had, been, seriously, compromised, his, output, never, large, became, smaller, nonetheless, after, the, death, of, debussy, in, 1918, he, was, generally, seen, in, france, and, abroad, as, the, leading, french, composer, of, the, era, faur, wrote, to, him, i, am, happier, than, you, can, imagine, about, the, solid, position, which, you, occupy, and, which, you, have, acquired, so, brilliantly, and, so, rapidly, it, is, a, source, of, joy, and, pride, for, your, old, professor, ravel, was, offered, the, legion, of, honour, in, 1920, and, although, he, declined, the, decoration, he, was, viewed, by, the, new, generation, of, composers, typified, by, satie, s, prot, g, s, les, six, as, an, establishment, figure, satie, had, turned, against, him, and, commented, ravel, refuses, the, l, gion, d, honneur, but, all, his, music, accepts, it, despite, this, attack, ravel, continued, to, admire, satie, s, early, music, and, always, acknowledged, the, older, man, s, influence, on, his, own, development, ravel, took, a, benign, view, of, les, six, promoting, their, music, and, defending, it, against, journalistic, attacks, he, regarded, their, reaction, against, his, works, as, natural, and, preferable, to, their, copying, his, style, through, the, soci, t, musicale, ind, pendente, he, was, able, to, encourage, them, and, composers, from, other, countries, the, soci, t, presented, concerts, of, recent, works, by, american, composers, including, aaron, copland, virgil, thomson, and, george, antheil, and, by, vaughan, williams, and, his, english, colleagues, arnold, bax, and, cyril, scott, orenstein, and, zank, both, comment, that, although, ravel, s, post, war, output, was, small, averaging, only, one, composition, a, year, it, included, some, of, his, finest, works, in, 1920, he, completed, la, valse, in, response, to, a, commission, from, diaghilev, he, had, worked, on, it, intermittently, for, some, years, planning, a, concert, piece, a, sort, of, apotheosis, of, the, viennese, waltz, mingled, with, in, my, mind, the, impression, of, a, fantastic, fatal, whirling, it, was, rejected, by, diaghilev, who, said, it, s, a, masterpiece, but, it, s, not, a, ballet, it, s, the, portrait, of, a, ballet, ravel, heard, diaghilev, s, verdict, without, protest, or, argument, left, and, had, no, further, dealings, with, him, nichols, comments, that, ravel, had, the, satisfaction, of, seeing, the, ballet, staged, twice, by, other, managements, before, diaghilev, died, a, ballet, danced, to, the, orchestral, version, of, le, tombeau, de, couperin, was, given, at, the, th, tre, des, champs, elys, es, in, november, 1920, and, the, premiere, of, la, valse, followed, in, december, the, following, year, daphnis, et, chlo, and, l, heure, espagnole, were, successfully, revived, at, the, paris, op, ra, in, the, post, war, era, there, was, a, reaction, against, the, large, scale, music, of, composers, such, as, gustav, mahler, and, richard, strauss, stravinsky, whose, rite, of, spring, was, written, for, a, huge, orchestra, began, to, work, on, a, much, smaller, scale, his, 1923, ballet, score, les, noces, is, composed, for, voices, and, twenty, one, instruments, ravel, did, not, like, the, work, his, opinion, caused, a, cooling, in, stravinsky, s, friendship, with, him, but, he, was, in, sympathy, with, the, fashion, for, d, pouillement, the, stripping, away, of, pre, war, extravagance, to, reveal, the, essentials, many, of, his, works, from, the, 1920s, are, noticeably, sparer, in, texture, than, earlier, pieces, other, influences, on, him, in, this, period, were, jazz, and, atonality, jazz, was, popular, in, parisian, caf, s, and, french, composers, such, as, darius, milhaud, incorporated, elements, of, it, in, their, work, ravel, commented, that, he, preferred, jazz, to, grand, opera, and, its, influence, is, heard, in, his, later, music, arnold, sch, nberg, s, abandonment, of, conventional, tonality, also, had, echoes, in, some, of, ravel, s, music, such, as, the, chansons, mad, casses, 1926, which, ravel, doubted, he, could, have, written, without, the, example, of, pierrot, lunaire, his, other, major, works, from, the, 1920s, include, the, orchestral, arrangement, of, mussorgsky, s, piano, suite, pictures, at, an, exhibition, 1922, the, opera, l, enfant, et, les, sortil, ges, to, a, libretto, by, colette, 1926, tzigane, 1924, and, the, violin, sonata, no, 2, 1927, finding, city, life, fatiguing, ravel, moved, to, the, countryside, in, may, 1921, he, took, up, residence, at, le, belv, d, re, a, small, house, on, the, fringe, of, montfort, l, amaury, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, west, of, paris, in, the, seine, et, oise, d, partement, looked, after, by, a, devoted, housekeeper, mme, revelot, he, lived, there, for, the, rest, of, his, life, at, le, belv, d, re, ravel, composed, and, gardened, when, not, performing, in, paris, or, abroad, his, touring, schedule, increased, considerably, in, the, 1920s, with, concerts, in, britain, sweden, denmark, the, us, canada, spain, austria, and, italy, ravel, was, fascinated, by, the, dynamism, of, american, life, its, huge, cities, skyscrapers, and, its, advanced, technology, and, was, impressed, by, its, jazz, negro, spirituals, and, the, excellence, of, american, orchestras, american, cuisine, was, apparently, another, matter, arbie, orenstein, after, two, months, of, planning, ravel, made, a, four, month, tour, of, north, america, in, 1928, playing, and, conducting, his, fee, was, a, guaranteed, minimum, of, 10, 000, and, a, constant, supply, of, gauloises, cigarettes, he, appeared, with, most, of, the, leading, orchestras, in, canada, and, the, us, and, visited, twenty, five, cities, audiences, were, enthusiastic, and, the, critics, were, complimentary, at, an, all, ravel, programme, conducted, by, serge, koussevitzky, in, new, york, the, entire, audience, stood, up, and, applauded, as, the, composer, took, his, seat, ravel, was, touched, by, this, spontaneous, gesture, and, observed, you, know, this, doesn, t, happen, to, me, in, paris, orenstein, commenting, that, this, tour, marked, the, zenith, of, ravel, s, international, reputation, lists, its, non, musical, highlights, as, a, visit, to, poe, s, house, in, new, york, and, excursions, to, niagara, falls, and, the, grand, canyon, ravel, was, unmoved, by, his, new, international, celebrity, he, commented, that, the, critics, recent, enthusiasm, was, of, no, more, importance, than, their, earlier, judgment, when, they, called, him, the, most, perfect, example, of, insensitivity, and, lack, of, emotion, the, last, composition, ravel, completed, in, the, 1920s, bol, ro, became, his, most, famous, he, was, commissioned, to, provide, a, score, for, ida, rubinstein, s, ballet, company, and, having, been, unable, to, secure, the, rights, to, orchestrate, alb, niz, s, iberia, he, decided, on, an, experiment, in, a, very, special, and, limited, direction, a, piece, lasting, seventeen, minutes, and, consisting, wholly, of, orchestral, tissue, without, music, ravel, continued, that, the, work, was, one, long, very, gradual, crescendo, there, are, no, contrasts, and, there, is, practically, no, invention, except, the, plan, and, the, manner, of, the, execution, the, themes, are, altogether, impersonal, he, was, astonished, and, not, wholly, pleased, that, it, became, a, mass, success, when, one, elderly, member, of, the, audience, at, the, op, ra, shouted, rubbish, at, the, premiere, he, remarked, that, old, lady, got, the, message, the, work, was, popularised, by, the, conductor, arturo, toscanini, and, has, been, recorded, several, hundred, times, ravel, commented, to, arthur, honegger, one, of, les, six, i, ve, written, only, one, masterpiece, bol, ro, unfortunately, there, s, no, music, in, it, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1930s, ravel, was, working, on, two, piano, concertos, he, completed, the, piano, concerto, in, d, major, for, the, left, hand, first, it, was, commissioned, by, the, austrian, pianist, paul, wittgenstein, who, had, lost, his, right, arm, during, the, first, world, war, ravel, was, stimulated, by, the, technical, challenges, of, the, project, in, a, work, of, this, kind, it, is, essential, to, give, the, impression, of, a, texture, no, thinner, than, that, of, a, part, written, for, both, hands, ravel, not, proficient, enough, to, perform, the, work, with, only, his, left, hand, demonstrated, it, with, both, hands, wittgenstein, was, initially, disappointed, by, the, piece, but, after, long, study, he, became, fascinated, by, it, and, ranked, it, as, a, great, work, in, january, 1932, he, premiered, it, in, vienna, to, instant, acclaim, and, performed, it, in, paris, with, ravel, conducting, the, following, year, the, critic, henry, pruni, res, wrote, from, the, opening, measures, we, are, plunged, into, a, world, in, which, ravel, has, but, rarely, introduced, us, the, piano, concerto, in, g, major, was, completed, a, year, later, after, the, premiere, in, january, 1932, there, was, high, praise, for, the, soloist, marguerite, long, and, for, ravel, s, score, though, not, for, his, conducting, long, the, dedicatee, played, the, concerto, in, more, than, twenty, european, cities, with, the, composer, conducting, they, planned, to, record, it, together, but, at, the, sessions, ravel, confined, himself, to, supervising, proceedings, and, pedro, de, freitas, branco, conducted, his, final, years, were, cruel, for, he, was, gradually, losing, his, memory, and, some, of, his, coordinating, powers, and, he, was, of, course, quite, aware, of, it, igor, stravinsky, in, october, 1932, ravel, suffered, a, blow, to, the, head, in, a, taxi, accident, the, injury, was, not, thought, serious, at, the, time, but, in, a, study, for, the, british, medical, journal, in, 1988, the, neurologist, r, a, henson, concludes, that, it, may, have, exacerbated, an, existing, cerebral, condition, as, early, as, 1927, close, friends, had, been, concerned, at, ravel, s, growing, absent, mindedness, and, within, a, year, of, the, accident, he, started, to, experience, symptoms, suggesting, aphasia, before, the, accident, he, had, begun, work, on, music, for, a, film, don, quixote, 1933, but, he, was, unable, to, meet, the, production, schedule, and, jacques, ibert, wrote, most, of, the, score, ravel, completed, three, songs, for, baritone, and, orchestra, intended, for, the, film, they, were, published, as, don, quichotte, dulcin, e, the, manuscript, orchestral, score, is, in, ravel, s, hand, but, lucien, garban, and, manuel, rosenthal, helped, in, transcription, ravel, composed, no, more, after, this, the, exact, nature, of, his, illness, is, unknown, experts, have, ruled, out, the, possibility, of, a, tumour, and, have, variously, suggested, frontotemporal, dementia, alzheimer, s, disease, and, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, though, no, longer, able, to, write, music, or, perform, ravel, remained, physically, and, socially, active, until, his, last, months, henson, notes, that, ravel, preserved, most, or, all, his, auditory, imagery, and, could, still, hear, music, in, his, head, in, 1937, ravel, began, to, suffer, pain, from, his, condition, and, was, examined, by, clovis, vincent, a, well, known, paris, neurosurgeon, vincent, advised, surgical, treatment, he, thought, a, tumour, unlikely, and, expected, to, find, ventricular, dilatation, that, surgery, might, prevent, from, progressing, ravel, s, brother, edouard, accepted, this, advice, as, henson, comments, the, patient, was, in, no, state, to, express, a, considered, view, after, the, operation, there, seemed, to, be, an, improvement, in, his, condition, but, it, was, short, lived, and, he, soon, lapsed, into, a, coma, he, died, on, 28, december, at, the, age, of, 62, on, 30, december, 1937, ravel, was, interred, next, to, his, parents, in, a, granite, tomb, at, levallois, perret, cemetery, in, north, west, paris, he, was, an, atheist, and, there, was, no, religious, ceremony, marcel, marnat, s, catalogue, of, ravel, s, complete, works, lists, eighty, five, works, including, many, incomplete, or, abandoned, though, that, total, is, small, in, comparison, with, the, output, of, his, major, contemporaries, it, is, nevertheless, inflated, by, ravel, s, frequent, practice, of, writing, works, for, piano, and, later, rewriting, them, as, independent, pieces, for, orchestra, the, performable, body, of, works, numbers, about, sixty, slightly, more, than, half, are, instrumental, ravel, s, music, includes, pieces, for, piano, chamber, music, two, piano, concerti, ballet, music, opera, and, song, cycles, he, wrote, no, symphonies, or, church, works, ravel, drew, on, many, generations, of, french, composers, from, couperin, and, rameau, to, faur, and, the, more, recent, innovations, of, satie, and, debussy, foreign, influences, include, mozart, schubert, liszt, and, chopin, he, considered, himself, in, many, ways, a, classicist, often, using, traditional, structures, and, forms, such, as, the, ternary, to, present, his, new, melodic, and, rhythmic, content, and, innovative, harmonies, the, influence, of, jazz, on, his, later, music, is, heard, within, conventional, classical, structures, in, the, piano, concerto, and, the, violin, sonata, whatever, sauce, you, put, around, the, melody, is, a, matter, of, taste, what, is, important, is, the, melodic, line, ravel, to, vaughan, williams, ravel, placed, high, importance, on, melody, telling, vaughan, williams, that, there, is, an, implied, melodic, outline, in, all, vital, music, his, themes, are, frequently, modal, eschewing, the, familiar, major, or, minor, scales, chords, of, the, ninth, and, eleventh, and, unresolved, appoggiaturas, such, as, those, in, the, valses, nobles, et, sentimentales, are, characteristic, of, ravel, s, harmonic, language, dance, forms, appealed, to, ravel, most, famously, the, bolero, and, pavane, but, also, the, minuet, forlane, rigaudon, waltz, czardas, habanera, and, passacaglia, national, and, regional, consciousness, was, important, to, him, and, although, a, planned, concerto, on, basque, themes, never, materialised, his, works, include, allusions, to, hebraic, greek, hungarian, and, gypsy, themes, he, wrote, several, short, pieces, paying, tribute, to, composers, he, admired, borodin, chabrier, faur, and, haydn, interpreting, their, characteristics, in, a, ravellian, style, another, important, influence, was, literary, rather, than, musical, ravel, said, that, he, learnt, from, poe, that, true, art, is, a, perfect, balance, between, pure, intellect, and, emotion, with, the, corollary, that, a, piece, of, music, should, be, a, perfectly, balanced, entity, with, no, irrelevant, material, allowed, to, intrude, ravel, completed, two, operas, and, worked, on, three, others, the, unrealised, three, were, olympia, la, cloche, engloutie, and, jeanne, d, arc, olympia, was, to, be, based, on, hoffmann, s, the, sandman, he, made, sketches, for, it, in, 1898, 99, but, did, not, progress, far, la, cloche, engloutie, after, hauptmann, s, the, sunken, bell, occupied, him, intermittently, from, 1906, to, 1912, ravel, destroyed, the, sketches, for, both, these, works, except, for, a, symphonie, horlog, re, which, he, incorporated, into, the, opening, of, l, heure, espagnole, the, third, unrealised, project, was, an, operatic, version, of, joseph, delteil, s, 1925, novel, about, joan, of, arc, it, was, to, be, a, large, scale, full, length, work, for, the, paris, op, ra, but, ravel, s, final, illness, prevented, him, from, writing, it, ravel, s, first, completed, opera, was, l, heure, espagnole, premiered, in, 1911, described, as, a, com, die, musicale, it, is, among, the, works, set, in, or, illustrating, spain, that, ravel, wrote, throughout, his, career, nichols, comments, that, the, essential, spanish, colouring, gave, ravel, a, reason, for, virtuoso, use, of, the, modern, orchestra, which, the, composer, considered, perfectly, designed, for, underlining, and, exaggerating, comic, effects, edward, burlingame, hill, found, ravel, s, vocal, writing, particularly, skilful, in, the, work, giving, the, singers, something, besides, recitative, without, hampering, the, action, and, commenting, orchestrally, upon, the, dramatic, situations, and, the, sentiments, of, the, actors, without, diverting, attention, from, the, stage, some, find, the, characters, artificial, and, the, piece, lacking, in, humanity, the, critic, david, murray, writes, that, the, score, glows, with, the, famous, ravel, tendresse, the, second, opera, also, in, one, act, is, l, enfant, et, les, sortil, ges, 1926, a, fantaisie, lyrique, to, a, libretto, by, colette, she, and, ravel, had, planned, the, story, as, a, ballet, but, at, the, composer, s, suggestion, colette, turned, it, into, an, opera, libretto, it, is, more, uncompromisingly, modern, in, its, musical, style, than, l, heure, espagnole, and, the, jazz, elements, and, bitonality, of, much, of, the, work, upset, many, parisian, opera, goers, ravel, was, once, again, accused, of, artificiality, and, lack, of, human, emotion, but, nichols, finds, profoundly, serious, feeling, at, the, heart, of, this, vivid, and, entertaining, work, the, score, presents, an, impression, of, simplicity, disguising, intricate, links, between, themes, with, in, murray, s, phrase, extraordinary, and, bewitching, sounds, from, the, orchestra, pit, throughout, although, one, act, operas, are, generally, staged, less, often, than, full, length, ones, ravel, s, are, produced, regularly, in, france, and, abroad, a, substantial, proportion, of, ravel, s, output, was, vocal, his, early, works, in, that, sphere, include, cantatas, written, for, his, unsuccessful, attempts, at, the, prix, de, rome, his, other, vocal, music, from, that, period, shows, debussy, s, influence, in, what, kelly, describes, as, a, static, recitative, like, vocal, style, prominent, piano, parts, and, rhythmic, flexibility, by, 1906, ravel, was, taking, even, further, than, debussy, the, natural, sometimes, colloquial, setting, of, the, french, language, in, histoires, naturelles, the, same, technique, is, highlighted, in, trois, po, mes, de, mallarm, 1913, debussy, set, two, of, the, three, poems, at, the, same, time, as, ravel, and, the, former, s, word, setting, is, noticeably, more, formal, than, the, latter, s, in, which, syllables, are, often, elided, in, the, cycles, sh, h, razade, and, chansons, mad, casses, ravel, gives, vent, to, his, taste, for, the, exotic, even, the, sensual, in, both, the, vocal, line, and, the, accompaniment, ravel, s, songs, often, draw, on, vernacular, styles, using, elements, of, many, folk, traditions, in, such, works, as, cinq, m, lodies, populaires, grecques, deux, m, lodies, h, bra, ques, and, chants, populaires, among, the, poets, on, whose, lyrics, he, drew, were, marot, l, on, paul, fargue, leconte, de, lisle, and, verlaine, for, three, songs, dating, from, 1914, to, 1915, he, wrote, his, own, texts, although, ravel, wrote, for, mixed, choirs, and, male, solo, voices, he, is, chiefly, associated, in, his, songs, with, the, soprano, and, mezzo, soprano, voices, even, when, setting, lyrics, clearly, narrated, by, a, man, he, often, favoured, a, female, voice, and, he, seems, to, have, preferred, his, best, known, cycle, sh, h, razade, to, be, sung, by, a, woman, although, a, tenor, voice, is, a, permitted, alternative, in, the, score, during, his, lifetime, it, was, above, all, as, a, master, of, orchestration, that, ravel, was, famous, he, minutely, studied, the, ability, of, each, orchestral, instrument, to, determine, its, potential, putting, its, individual, colour, and, timbre, to, maximum, use, the, critic, alexis, roland, manuel, wrote, in, reality, he, is, with, stravinsky, the, one, man, in, the, world, who, best, knows, the, weight, of, a, trombone, note, the, harmonics, of, a, cello, or, a, pp, tam, tam, in, the, relationships, of, one, orchestral, group, to, another, for, all, ravel, s, orchestral, mastery, only, four, of, his, works, were, conceived, as, concert, works, for, symphony, orchestra, rapsodie, espagnole, la, valse, and, the, two, concertos, all, the, other, orchestral, works, were, written, either, for, the, stage, as, in, daphnis, et, chlo, or, as, a, reworking, of, piano, pieces, alborada, del, gracioso, and, une, barque, sur, l, ocean, miroirs, valses, nobles, et,

harmonic, language, of, the, score, and, brings, sharpness, to, classical, dance, rhythms, occasionally, as, in, the, alborada, del, gracioso, critics, have, found, the, later, orchestral, version, less, persuasive, than, the, sharp, edged, piano, original, in, some, of, his, scores, from, the, 1920s, including, daphnis, et, chlo, ravel, frequently, divides, his, upper, strings, having, them, play, in, six, to, eight, parts, while, the, woodwind, are, required, to, play, with, extreme, agility, his, writing, for, the, brass, ranges, from, softly, muted, to, triple, forte, outbursts, at, climactic, points, in, the, 1930s, he, tended, to, simplify, his, orchestral, textures, the, lighter, tone, of, the, g, major, piano, concerto, follows, the, models, of, mozart, and, saint, sa, ns,

invented, the, composer, can, truly, be, said, to, join, hands, with, mozart, the, most, popular, of, ravel, s, orchestral, works, bol, ro, 1928, was, conceived, several, years, before, its, completion, in, 1924, he, said, that, he, was, contemplating, a, symphonic, poem, without, a, subject, where, the, whole, interest, will, be, in, the, rhythm, ravel, made, orchestral, versions, of, piano, works, by, schumann, chabrier, debussy, and, mussorgsky, s, piano, suite, pictures, at, an, exhibition, orchestral, versions, of, the, last, by, mikhail, tushmalov, sir, henry, wood, and, leo, funtek, predated, ravel, s, 1922, version, and, many, more, have, been, made, since, but, ravel, s, remains, the, best, known, kelly, remarks, on, its, dazzling, array, of, instrumental, colour, and, a, contemporary, reviewer, commented, on, how, in, dealing, with, another, composer, s, music, ravel, had, produced, an, orchestral, sound, wholly, unlike, his, own, although, ravel, wrote, fewer, than, thirty, works, for, the, piano, they, exemplify, his, range, orenstein, remarks, that, the, composer, keeps, his, personal, touch, from, the, striking, simplicity, of, ma, m, re, l, oye, to, the, transcendental, virtuosity, of, gaspard, de, la, nuit, ravel, s, earliest, major, work, for, piano, jeux, d, eau, 1901, is, frequently, cited, as, evidence, that, he, evolved, his, style, independently, of, debussy, whose, major, works, for, piano, all, came, later, when, writing, for, solo, piano, ravel, rarely, aimed, at, the, intimate, chamber, effect, characteristic, of, debussy, but, sought, a, lisztian, virtuosity, the, authors, of, the, record, guide, consider, that, works, such, as, gaspard, de, la, nuit, and, miroirs, have, a, beauty, and, originality, with, a, deeper, inspiration, in, the, harmonic, and, melodic, genius, of, ravel, himself, most, of, ravel, s, piano, music, is, extremely, difficult, to, play, and, presents, pianists, with, a, balance, of, technical, and, artistic, challenges, writing, of, the, piano, music, the, critic, andrew, clark, commented, in, 2013, a, successful, ravel, interpretation, is, a, finely, balanced, thing, it, involves, subtle, musicianship, a, feeling, for, pianistic, colour, and, the, sort, of, lightly, worn, virtuosity, that, masks, the, advanced, technical, challenges, he, makes, in, alborada, del, gracioso, and, the, two, outer, movements, of, gaspard, de, la, nuit, too, much, temperament, and, the, music, loses, its, classical, shape, too, little, and, it, sounds, pale, this, balance, caused, a, breach, between, the, composer, and, vi, es, who, said, that, if, he, observed, the, nuances, and, speeds, ravel, stipulated, in, gaspard, de, la, nuit, le, gibet, would, bore, the, audience, to, death, some, pianists, continue, to, attract, criticism, for, over, interpreting, ravel, s, piano, writing, ravel, s, regard, for, his, predecessors, is, heard, in, several, of, his, piano, works, menuet, sur, le, nom, de, haydn, 1909, la, mani, re, de, borodine, 1912, la, mani, re, de, chabrier, 1913, and, le, tombeau, de, couperin, all, incorporate, elements, of, the, named, composers, interpreted, in, a, characteristically, ravellian, manner, clark, comments, that, those, piano, works, which, ravel, later, orchestrated, are, overshadowed, by, the, revised, versions, listen, to, le, tombeau, de, couperin, and, the, complete, ballet, music, for, ma, m, re, l, oye, in, the, classic, recordings, conducted, by, andr, cluytens, and, the, piano, versions, never, sound, quite, the, same, again, apart, from, a, one, movement, sonata, for, violin, and, piano, dating, from, 1899, unpublished, in, the, composer, s, lifetime, ravel, wrote, seven, chamber, works, the, earliest, is, the, string, quartet, 1902, 03, dedicated, to, faur, and, showing, the, influence, of, debussy, s, quartet, of, ten, years, earlier, like, the, debussy, it, differs, from, the, more, monumental, quartets, of, the, established, french, school, of, franck, and, his, followers, with, more, succinct, melodies, fluently, interchanged, in, flexible, tempos, and, varieties, of, instrumental, colour, the, introduction, and, allegro, for, harp, flute, clarinet, and, string, quartet, 1905, was, composed, very, quickly, by, ravel, s, standards, it, is, an, ethereal, piece, in, the, vein, of, the, pavane, pour, une, infante, d, funte, ravel, also, worked, at, unusual, speed, on, the, piano, trio, 1914, to, complete, it, before, joining, the, french, army, it, contains, basque, baroque, and, far, eastern, influences, and, shows, ravel, s, growing, technical, skill, dealing, with, the, difficulties, of, balancing, the, percussive, piano, with, the, sustained, sound, of, the, violin, and, cello, blending, the, two, disparate, elements, in, a, musical, language, that, is, unmistakably, his, own, in, the, words, of, the, commentator, keith, anderson, ravel, s, four, chamber, works, composed, after, the, first, world, war, are, the, sonata, for, violin, and, cello, 1920, 22, the, berceuse, sur, le, nom, de, gabriel, faur, for, violin, and, piano, 1922, the, chamber, original, of, tzigane, for, violin, and, piano, 1924, and, finally, the, violin, sonata, 1923, 27, the, two, middle, works, are, respectively, an, affectionate, tribute, to, ravel, s, teacher, and, a, virtuoso, display, piece, for, the, violinist, jelly, d, ar, nyi, the, violin, and, cello, sonata, is, a, departure, from, the, rich, textures, and, harmonies, of, the, pre, war, piano, trio, the, composer, said, that, it, marked, a, turning, point, in, his, career, with, thinness, of, texture, pushed, to, the, extreme, and, harmonic, charm, renounced, in, favour, of, pure, melody, his, last, chamber, work, the, violin, sonata, sometimes, called, the, second, after, the, posthumous, publication, of, his, student, sonata, is, a, frequently, dissonant, work, ravel, said, that, the, violin, and, piano, are, essentially, incompatible, instruments, and, that, his, sonata, reveals, their, incompatibility, sackville, west, and, shawe, taylor, consider, the, post, war, sonatas, rather, laboured, and, unsatisfactory, and, neither, work, has, matched, the, popularity, of, ravel, s, pre, war, chamber, works, ravel, s, interpretations, of, some, of, his, piano, works, were, captured, on, piano, roll, between, 1914, and, 1928, although, some, rolls, supposedly, played, by, him, may, have, been, made, under, his, supervision, by, robert, casadesus, a, better, pianist, transfers, of, the, rolls, have, been, released, on, compact, disc, in, 1913, there, was, a, gramophone, recording, of, jeux, d, eau, played, by, mark, hambourg, and, by, the, early, 1920s, there, were, discs, featuring, the, pavane, pour, une, infante, d, funte, and, ondine, and, movements, from, the, string, quartet, le, tombeau, de, couperin, and, ma, m, re, l, oye, ravel, was, among, the, first, composers, who, recognised, the, potential, of, recording, to, bring, their, music, to, a, wider, public, and, throughout, the, 1920s, there, was, a, steady, stream, of, recordings, of, his, works, some, of, which, featured, the, composer, as, pianist, or, conductor, a, 1932, recording, of, the, g, major, piano, concerto, was, advertised, as, conducted, by, the, composer, although, he, had, in, fact, supervised, the, sessions, while, a, more, proficient, conductor, took, the, baton, recordings, for, which, ravel, actually, was, the, conductor, included, a, bol, ro, in, 1930, and, a, sound, film, of, a, 1933, performance, of, the, d, major, concerto, with, wittgenstein, as, soloist, ravel, declined, not, only, the, l, gion, d, honneur, but, all, state, honours, from, france, refusing, to, let, his, name, go, forward, for, election, to, the, institut, de, france, he, accepted, foreign, awards, including, honorary, membership, of, the, royal, philharmonic, society, in, 1921, the, belgian, ordre, de, l, opold, in, 1926, and, an, honorary, doctorate, from, the, university, of, oxford, in, 1928, after, ravel, s, death, his, brother, and, legatee, edouard, turned, the, composer, s, house, at, montfort, l, amaury, into, a, museum, leaving, it, substantially, as, ravel, had, known, it, as, at, 2023, the, maison, mus, e, de, maurice, ravel, remains, open, for, guided, tours, in, his, later, years, edouard, ravel, declared, his, intention, to, leave, the, bulk, of, the, composer, s, estate, to, the, city, of, paris, for, the, endowment, of, a, nobel, prize, in, music, but, evidently, changed, his, mind, after, his, death, in, 1960, the, estate, passed, through, several, hands, despite, the, substantial, royalties, paid, for, performing, ravel, s, music, the, news, magazine, le, point, reported, in, 2000, that, it, was, unclear, who, the, beneficiaries, were, the, british, newspaper, the, guardian, reported, in, 2001, that, no, money, from, royalties, had, been, forthcoming, for, the, maintenance, of, the, ravel, museum, at, montfort, l, amaury, which, was, in, a, poor, state, of, repair, many, works, have, been, dedicated, to, ravel, or, composed, in, his, memory, by, satie, stravinsky, and, others
