does, not, tax, local, streets, for, non, local, traffic, there, should, be, a, system, of, viaducts, which, encase, an, area, which, can, reclaim, the, local, streets, for, their, own, use, and, it, should, be, made, so, this, viaduct, has, a, ground, floor, of, shops, and, usable, area, a, model, which, i, did, for, the, graham, foundation, recently, and, which, i, presented, to, mr, entenza,

taste, isamu, noguchi, called, him, a, philosopher, among, architects, he, was, concerned, with, creating, strong, formal, distinctions, between, served, spaces, and, servant, spaces, what, he, meant, by, servant, spaces, was, not, spaces, for, servants, but, rather, spaces, that, serve, other, spaces, such, as, stairwells, corridors, restrooms, or, any, other, back, of, house, function, such, as, storage, space, or, mechanical, rooms, his, palette, of, materials, tended, toward, heavily, textured, brick, and, bare, concrete, the, textures, often, reinforced, by, juxtaposition, to, highly, refined, surfaces, such, as, travertine, marble, kahn, argued, that, brick, can, be, more, than, the, basic, building, material, if, you, think, of, brick, you, say, to, brick, what, do, you, want, brick, and, brick, says, to, you, i, like, an, arch, and, if, you, say, to, brick, look, arches, are, expensive, and, i, can, use, a, concrete, lintel, over, you, what, do, you, think, of, that, brick, brick, says, i, like, an, arch, and, it, s, important, you, see, that, you, honor, the, material, that, you, use, you, can, only, do, it, if, you, honor, the, brick, and, glorify, the, brick, instead, of, shortchanging, it, in, addition, to, the, influence, kahn, s, better, known, work, has, on, contemporary, architects, such, as, muzharul, islam, tadao, ando, some, of, his, work, especially, the, unbuilt, city, tower, project, became, very, influential, among, the, high, tech, architects, of, the, late, twentieth, century, such, as, renzo, piano, who, worked, in, kahn, s, office, richard, rogers, and, norman, foster, his, prominent, apprentices, include, muzharul, islam, moshe, safdie, robert, venturi, jack, diamond, and, charles, dagit, many, years, after, his, death,
