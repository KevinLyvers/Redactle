unsuccessful, at, the, box, office, with, the, genre, and, grant, both, hugely, popular, at, the, time, biographer, a, scott, berg, believes, the, blame, lay, with, moviegoers, rejection, of, hepburn, after, the, release, of, bringing, up, baby, the, independent, theatre, owners, of, america, included, hepburn, on, a, list, of, actors, considered, box, office, poison, her, reputation, at, a, low,

many, actors, were, afraid, to, leave, the, stability, of, the, studio, system, at, the, time, but, hepburn, s, personal, wealth, meant, she, could, afford, to, be, independent, she, signed, on, for, the, film, version, of, holiday, 1938, with, columbia, pictures, pairing, her, for, the, third, time, with, grant, to, play, a, stifled, society, girl, who, finds, joy, with, her, sister, s, fianc, the, comedy, was, positively, reviewed, but, it, failed, to, draw, much, of, an, audience, and, the, next, script, offered, to, hepburn, came, with, a, salary, of, 10, 000, less, than, she, had, received, at, the, start, of, her, film, career, reflecting, on, this, change, in, fortunes, andrew, britton, writes, of, hepburn, no, other, star, has, emerged, with, greater, rapidity, or, with, more, ecstatic, acclaim, no, other, star, either, has, become, so, unpopular, so, quickly, for, so, long, a, time, following, this, decline, in, her, career, hepburn, took, action, to, create, her,

the, actress, with, the, character, of, socialite, tracy, lord, incorporating, a, mixture, of, humor, aggression, nervousness, and, vulnerability, howard, hughes, hepburn, s, partner, at, the, time, sensed, that, the, play, could, be, her, ticket, back, to, hollywood, stardom, and, bought, her, the, film, rights, before, it, even, debuted, on, stage, the, philadelphia, story, first, toured, the, united, states, to, positive, reviews, and, then, opened, in, new, york, at, the, shubert, theatre, on, march, 28, 1939, it, was, a, big, hit, critically, and, financially, running, for, 417, performances, and, then, going, on, a, second, successful, tour, several, of, the, major, film, studios, approached, hepburn, to, produce, the, movie, version, of, barry, s, play, she, chose, to, sell, the, rights, to, metro, goldwyn, mayer, mgm, hollywood, s, number, one, studio, on, the, condition, that, she, be, the, star, as, part, of, the, deal, she, also, received, the, director, of, her, choice, george, cukor, and, picked, james, stewart, and, cary, grant, to, whom, she, ceded, top, billing, as, co, stars, before, filming, began, hepburn, shrewdly, noted, i, don, t, want, to, make, a, grand, entrance, in, this, picture, moviegoers, think, i, m, too, la, di, da, or, something, a, lot, of, people, want, to, see, me, fall, flat, on, my, face, thus, the, film, began, with, grant, knocking, the, actress, flat, on, her, backside, berg, describes, how, the, character, was, crafted, to, have, audiences, laugh, at, her, enough, that, they, would, ultimately, sympathize, with, her, which, hepburn, felt, was, crucial, in, recreating, her, public, image, the, philadelphia, story, was, one, of, the, biggest, hits, of, 1940, breaking, records, at, radio, city, music,
