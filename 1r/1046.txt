lycurgus, l, a, k, r, s, greek, lykourgos, was, the, legendary, lawgiver, of, sparta, credited, with, the, formation, of, its, eunomia, good, order, involving, political, economic, and, social, reforms, to, produce, a, military, oriented, spartan, society, in, accordance, with, the, delphic, oracle, the, spartans, in, the, historical, period, honoured, him, as, god, as, a, historical, figure, almost, nothing, is, known, for, certain, about, him, including, when, he, lived, and, what, he, did, in, life, the, stories, of, him, place, him, at, multiple, times, nor, is, it, clear, when, the, political, reforms, attributed, to, him, called, the, great, rhetra, occurred, ancient, dates, range, from, putting, aside, the, implausibly, early, xenophonic, 11th, century, bc, the, early, ninth, century, c, 885, bc, to, as, late, as, early, eighth, century, c, 776, bc, there, remains, no, consensus, as, to, when, he, lived, some, modern, scholars, deny, that, he, existed, at, all, the, reforms, at, various, times, attributed, to, him, touch, all, aspects, of, spartan, society, they, included, the, creation, of, the, spartan, constitution, in, most, traditions, after, the, dual, monarchy, the, imposition, of, the, spartan, mess, halls, called, syssitia, the, redistribution, of, land, to, each, citizen, by, head, spartan, austerity, and, frugality, and, sparta, s, unique, wedding, and, funerary, customs, none, of, these, reforms, can, be, concretely, attributed, to, lycurgus, most, of, the, reforms, likely, date, to, the, late, sixth, century, bc, shortly, before, 500, bc, postdating, his, supposed, life, by, centuries, some, of, the, reforms, such, as, for, the, redistribution, of, land, are, fictitious, the, extent, of, the, lycurgan, myth, emerges, from, sparta, s, self, justification, seeking, to, endow, its, customs, with, timeless, and, divinely, sanctioned, antiquity, that, antiquity, was, also, malleable, reinvented, at, various, times, to, justify, the, new, as, a, return, to, lycurgus, ideal, society, his, land, reforms, for, example, are, attested, only, after, the, reformist, spartan, monarchs, agis, iv, and, cleomenes, iii, who, sought, to, redistribute, sparta, s, land, the, reforms, attributed, to, lycurgus, however, have, been, praised, by, ancients, and, moderns, alike, seeing, at, various, times, different, morals, projected, on, a, figure, of, which, so, little, concrete, can, be, known, a, multitude, of, ancient, sources, mention, lycurgus, it, is, however, troubling, inasmuch, as, those, accounts, evolved, according, to, then, contemporary, political, priorities, and, that, they, are, profoundly, inconsistent, the, oldest, is, that, of, herodotus, who, wrote, in, the, latter, half, of, the, fifth, century, bc, his, account, is, likely, based, on, oral, accounts, from, both, spartans, and, non, spartans, in, greece, the, two, royal, dynasties, of, sparta, the, agiads, and, eurypontids, both, claimed, lycurgus, in, their, ancestries, however, lycurgus, does, not, feature, in, the, earliest, preserved, spartan, source, the, poet, tyrtaeus, which, has, led, many, historians, today, to, doubt, his, historicity, for, example, massimo, nafissi, in, a, companion, to, sparta, writes, he, is, probably, mythical, others, have, attempted, to, glean, from, the, myths, that, survive, some, kernel, of, truth, but, most, historians, would, subscribe, to, the, stark, judgement, of, antony, andrewes, if, there, was, a, real, lycurgus, we, know, nothing, of, him, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, when, a, historical, lycurgus, lived, neither, today, or, in, the, ancient, world, plutarch, in, his, life, of, lycurgus, in, fact, makes, this, remark, in, the, opening, paragraph, most, attempts, to, date, his, life, are, based, on, when, the, great, rhetra, which, promulgated, lycurgus, reforms, occurred, the, most, accepted, date, in, the, ancient, world, was, that, based, on, the, genealogy, of, ephorus, and, the, chronology, of, eratosthenes, which, dated, the, rhetra, to, 118, years, after, the, reign, of, one, of, sparta, s, founding, kings, procles, which, corresponds, to, c, 885, bc, alternatively, an, excursus, in, the, 5th, century, bc, greek, historian, thucydides, archaeology, indicates, that, the, reforms, were, instituted, some, four, hundred, years, prior, to, the, end, of, the, peloponnesian, war, placing, them, to, 804, or, 821, bc, the, 4th, century, bc, greek, general, xenophon, on, the, other, hand, claimed, that, he, was, also, responsible, for, the, creation, of, the, lacedaemonian, dual, monarchy, placing, him, during, the, reign, of, the, heraclid, kings, eurysthenes, and, procles, dated, to, c, 1003, bc, modern, scholars, generally, date, the, great, rhetra, to, before, the, first, messenian, war, placing, it, prior, to, 736, bc, little, consensus, exists, for, any, more, specificity, nor, should, lycurgus, necessarily, be, credited, with, and, therefore, dated, to, the, rhetra, it, may, have, been, a, charter, created, some, time, in, the, seventh, century, to, justify, and, ennoble, with, antiquity, sparta, s, institutions, especially, after, sparta, s, emergence, as, the, most, powerful, state, in, greece, one, artefact, the, disc, of, iphitos, also, allegedly, documents, lycurgus, involvement, with, the, formation, of, the, olympic, games, and, would, therefore, place, him, c, 776, bc, per, the, philosopher, aristotle, the, disc, however, is, likely, a, forgery, from, the, fourth, century, bc, the, ancients, had, two, solutions, for, this, lack, of, chronological, clarity, the, historian, timaeus, posited, two, lycurguses, one, who, did, the, reforms, and, a, later, one, with, the, same, name, who, was, present, at, the, first, olympics, eratosthenes, instead, posited, the, disc, reflected, informal, olympics, held, before, 776, bc, the, tradition, in, sparta, of, lycurgus, existence, dates, to, some, time, between, the, archaic, age, and, the, fifth, century, inasmuch, as, no, lycurgus, is, mentioned, in, tyrtaeus, it, is, likely, that, the, legend, dates, to, shortly, after, tyrtaeus, time, and, therefore, the, late, seventh, or, early, sixth, century, it, likely, emerged, from, spartan, success, in, that, period, and, a, desire, to, explain, it, his, legend, was, also, constantly, reworked, and, expanded, through, the, course, of, the, classical, greek, period, by, securing, for, spartans, in, their, times, divine, sanction, and, greater, legitimacy, for, actions, which, they, claimed, to, be, a, return, to, lycurgus, laws, in, the, earlier, legends, of, lycurgus, namely, in, the, accounts, of, the, great, rhetra, lycurgus, is, not, credited, with, a, radical, reorganisation, of, spartan, life, or, with, the, institution, of, the, ephorate, these, early, oral, traditions, contra, the, written, accounts, are, far, from, uniform, the, earliest, surviving, written, account, on, lycurgus, is, in, herodotus, placing, him, as, the, guardian, and, regent, of, the, early, argiad, king, leobotes, later, accounts, of, lycurgus, activities, associate, him, with, the, later, more, influential, eurypontid, dynasty, instead, specifically, as, regent, of, charilaus, the, disputes, indicate, that, the, two, royal, houses, by, the, historical, period, attempted, to, associate, themselves, by, blood, with, the, figure, herodotus, provides, two, accounts, for, how, the, laws, which, lycurgus, enacted, came, to, him, in, the, first, version, lycurgus, receives, those, laws, from, apollo, through, the, pythia, at, delphi, in, the, second, based, on, sparta, s, own, traditions, lycurgus, bases, the, reforms, off, of, existing, laws, in, crete, spartan, and, cretan, institutions, did, indeed, have, common, characteristics, but, though, some, direct, borrowing, may, have, occurred, such, similarities, are, in, general, more, likely, to, be, because, of, the, common, dorian, inheritance, of, sparta, and, crete, rather, than, because, some, individual, such, as, lycurgus, imported, cretan, customs, to, sparta, some, versions, of, the, story, say, that, lycurgus, subsequently, traveled, as, far, as, egypt, spain, and, india, in, the, narrative, of, lycurgus, reforms, in, herodotus, lycurgus, is, supposed, to, have, created, much, of, the, spartan, constitution, including, the, gerousia, and, the, ephorate, respectively, the, spartan, council, of, elders, and, annually, elected, overseeing, magistrates, he, also, is, supposed, to, have, reorganised, spartan, military, life, and, instituted, the, syssitia, the, mess, halls, to, which, each, spartan, belonged, in, xenophon, s, telling, the, legend, of, lycurgus, expanded, even, further, ascribing, to, him, not, only, reforms, but, also, the, creation, of, the, lacedaemonian, dual, monarchy, and, state, as, well, the, description, of, lycurgus, as, a, regent, or, guardian, who, establishes, the, laws, characterises, him, as, a, selfless, figure, who, places, the, good, of, his, king, and, community, before, his, own, to, that, end, there, are, two, main, traditions, relating, to, his, regency, the, first, in, herodotus, is, that, he, undertakes, the, regency, until, his, ward, came, of, age, the, second, is, that, he, resigns, to, protect, his, ward, amid, rumours, that, he, wishes, to, supplant, the, ward, as, king, plutarch, s, version, of, the, story, includes, the, ward, s, mother, seeking, lycurgus, hand, in, marriage, to, facilitate, his, accession, in, this, version, lycurgus, leaves, to, prevent, himself, from, being, used, as, a, pawn, in, politics, against, his, nephew, the, tradition, where, lycurgus, continues, in, the, regency, has, little, difficulty, in, placing, him, in, a, position, to, promulgate, his, laws, but, the, latter, tradition, where, he, leaves, the, city, requires, him, to, be, recalled, in, aristotle, s, version, recounted, by, plutarch, lycurgus, leads, his, followers, into, the, city, and, occupies, the, agora, to, impose, his, laws, backed, by, apolline, divine, approval, he, forces, the, tyrannical, charilaus, to, accede, to, them, and, institutes, the, gerousia, xenophon, instead, has, lycurgus, forging, an, alliance, with, the, most, powerful, non, royal, citizens, and, forcing, the, laws, through, plutarch, s, narrative, presented, in, his, own, voice, instead, consolidates, prior, disparate, stories, into, a, general, upsurge, of, support, from, the, kings, the, people, and, the, aristocracy, in, plutarch, s, narrative, lycurgus, laws, cause, backlash, among, the, wealthy, who, attempt, to, have, him, stoned, after, he, flees, to, the, temple, of, athena, chalcioecus, and, has, one, of, his, eyes, put, out, by, an, adolescent, his, opponents, back, down, and, he, forgives, the, adolescent, the, extent, to, which, this, story, of, revolution, and, conflict, with, the, wealthy, is, driven, by, or, a, retrojection, from, the, experiences, of, the, reformist, spartan, kings, agis, iv, and, cleomenes, iii, is, unclear, the, two, later, spartan, kings, used, the, lycurgan, legend, to, justify, their, redistributive, policies, and, violent, means, as, a, return, to, lycurgus, true, spartan, traditions, deviations, from, which, explained, all, problems, of, latter, day, sparta, finally, in, plutarch, s, version, after, lycurgus, recall, to, sparta, to, institute, new, laws, he, has, the, community, swear, not, to, change, the, laws, until, he, returns, from, delphi, upon, reaching, delphi, he, dies, so, to, enshrine, the, laws, forever, lycurgus, laws, are, supposed, to, have, touched, the, whole, of, spartan, society, at, various, times, the, spartans, attributed, every, one, of, their, institutions, to, him, except, the, institution, of, the, dual, monarchy, because, the, spartans, attributed, all, manner, of, laws, and, customs, to, him, it, is, impossible, to, determine, which, laws, if, any, are, his, in, actuality, however, it, is, clear, today, from, comparisons, with, other, archaic, greek, states, that, spartan, institutions, such, as, men, s, dining, halls, organisation, of, age, cohorts, and, the, use, of, iron, money, were, not, entirely, out, of, the, norm, and, had, previously, existed, in, other, greek, cities, what, made, them, distinctive, was, for, how, long, they, had, been, preserved, at, sparta, the, character, of, many, of, the, economic, and, social, reforms, attributed, to, lycurgus, was, allegedly, to, ensure, that, citizens, competed, with, each, other, only, in, merit, rather, than, in, wealth, however, many, of, the, social, reforms, which, are, attributed, to, lycurgus, postdate, him, by, centuries, emerging, between, 500, and, 600, bc, during, the, second, messenian, war, or, after, the, completion, of, spartan, conquests, the, economic, reforms, which, are, supposed, to, have, made, spartan, citizens, equal, never, happened, and, were, invented, to, legitimise, redistributive, policies, in, the, hellenistic, period, lycurgus, political, reforms, were, supposedly, promulgated, in, a, great, rhetra, that, he, received, from, the, pythia, it, however, is, not, genuine, and, contains, anachronistic, contents, regardless, plutarch, records, it, as, having, included, provisions, related, to, sparta, s, religious, and, political, practices, after, dedicating, a, temple, to, zeus, and, athena, forming, phylai, and, creating, obai, and, instituting, a, gerousia, of, thirty, including, the, kings, then, hold, an, apella, from, time, to, time, thus, bring, in, and, set, aside, the, people, are, to, have, the, right, to, respond, and, power, but, if, the, people, speak, crookedly, the, elders, and, kings, are, to, be, setters, aside, plutarch, states, that, the, provision, that, the, elders, and, kings, could, set, aside, decisions, of, the, apella, called, the, rider, was, a, later, addition, however, the, grammatical, construction, of, preserved, rhetra, is, consistent, with, it, being, part, of, the, original, text, a, view, taken, by, massimo, nafissi, in, companion, to, archaic, greece, believing, that, the, idea, that, the, set, aside, provision, was, later, inserted, was, itself, a, fabrication, of, the, fourth, century, bc, lycurgus, is, supposed, also, to, have, established, the, spartan, mess, halls, called, syssitia, or, phiditia, such, halls, were, public, where, all, citizen, men, were, required, to, eat, dinner, citizens, were, required, to, contribute, to, the, mess, hall, s, pantries, with, a, substantial, amount, of, food, wine, and, money, failure, or, inability, to, do, so, would, entail, loss, of, citizenship, a, relatively, old, tradition, predating, the, hellenistic, spartan, reformers, agis, iv, and, cleomenes, iii, as, well, as, likely, herodotus, claimed, that, lycurgus, imposition, of, the, mess, halls, created, a, citizen, body, of, some, 9, 000, men, each, of, these, mess, halls, also, played, a, role, in, military, organisation, each, likely, had, 15, men, with, three, mess, halls, forming, a, sworn, band, but, after, the, perioikoi, were, merged, into, the, spartan, army, each, mess, hall, likely, formed, its, own, band, such, messes, were, likely, preceded, in, the, seventh, century, bc, poet, alcman, s, time, with, andreia, private, men, s, eating, clubs, they, became, the, classical, syssitia, after, sumptuary, restrictions, compulsory, contributions, from, poorer, citizens, who, previously, abstained, and, intermixture, of, rich, and, poor, shortly, before, 500, bc, the, silence, of, the, rhetra, a, text, meant, to, describe, and, legitimise, the, spartan, political, system, of, the, seventh, century, with, regard, to, sparta, s, ephors, suggests, that, the, ephorate, was, a, product, of, a, later, reform, at, sparta, and, was, not, lycurgan, pace, herodotus, and, plutarch, in, origin, in, fact, archaeological, discoveries, at, sparta, showing, the, decline, of, spartan, art, expressed, on, vases, as, well, as, a, sudden, expansion, of, agricultural, labour, in, the, mid, sixth, century, bc, suggest, that, much, of, the, communitarian, reforms, attributed, to, lycurgus, may, date, to, that, time, one, of, the, illusions, of, the, spartan, mirage, was, the, illusion, that, spartan, citizens, were, economically, equal, that, no, citizen, owned, more, land, than, another, there, is, however, no, evidence, of, equal, land, ownership, at, sparta, with, exception, of, cleomenes, five, year, regime, land, inequality, increased, through, spartan, history, mediated, by, conquests, abroad, which, allowed, poorer, citizens, to, retain, a, reasonable, standard, of, living, when, conquests, ended, after, 550, bc, the, poorer, citizens, were, over, time, removed, from, the, citizen, rolls, for, inability, to, pay, dues, to, the, syssitia, demands, for, redistribution, heard, by, the, reformist, spartan, monarchs, agis, iv, and, cleomenes, iii, led, to, the, creation, of, a, myth, that, lycurgus, redistributed, the, land, of, laconia, and, messenia, equally, among, the, homoioi, with, the, helots, as, bound, tenants, the, consensus, among, scholars, is, that, this, never, happened, the, seventh, century, spartan, poet, tyrtaeus, already, opposed, land, distribution, in, the, poem, eunomia, attesting, to, land, inequality, at, the, earliest, times, lycurgus, is, also, supposed, to, have, ensured, the, austere, lifestyle, of, the, spartans, by, banning, the, use, of, gold, and, silver, coins, requiring, a, currency, made, of, iron, xenophon, claimed, that, this, meant, acquisition, of, wealth, became, too, bulky, to, hide, plutarch, believed, that, this, was, to, make, it, impossible, or, at, least, difficult, for, spartans, to, purchase, luxury, goods, coinage, came, to, greece, in, the, 550s, bc, it, is, not, possible, that, any, law, mentioning, coins, dates, to, the, eighth, century, bc, or, earlier, when, lycurgus, is, supposed, to, have, lived, nor, is, any, ban, on, gold, and, silver, mentioned, in, herodotus, usage, of, gold, and, silver, at, sparta, is, implied, by, other, reports, that, the, kings, were, fined, in, drachma, and, talents, as, well, as, by, spartan, state, rewards, and, ransoms, plutarch, s, attempted, to, reconcile, the, evidence, by, depicting, the, spartans, allowing, gold, and, silver, for, public, use, but, retaining, the, allegedly, lycurgan, restrictions, on, private, use, such, a, depiction, however, is, not, consistent, with, actions, by, spartan, generals, during, the, peloponnesian, war, other, ancient, authors, were, more, equivocal, dating, the, alleged, ban, on, precious, metals, to, after, lycurgus, and, to, different, men, ancient, authors, claimed, of, the, spartans, a, general, aversion, to, commerce, which, was, also, attributed, to, lycurgus, who, was, supposed, to, have, forbade, free, men, to, touch, anything, to, do, with, making, money, this, likely, emerged, from, the, fact, that, spartan, citizens, the, spartiates, or, homoioi, were, a, leisurely, class, of, land, owners, who, looked, down, on, manual, labourers, and, craftsmen, such, a, ban, also, likely, emerged, in, the, sixth, century, since, spartan, citizen, sculptors, are, attested, to, prior, to, that, time, the, inequality, of, spartan, society, also, implies, that, trade, must, have, occurred, the, second, dinner, in, the, syssitia, involved, bread, meat, fish, and, other, produce, which, were, bought, or, donated, by, wealthy, spartans, plutarch, who, claims, spartan, did, not, dispute, or, talk, about, money, is, also, internally, inconsistent, when, elsewhere, notes, spartan, commercial, contracts, and, sparta, s, delegation, of, such, matters, to, expert, resolution, plutarch, also, claims, that, lycurgus, imposed, sumptuary, legislation, prohibiting, foreign, artisans, from, residing, at, sparta, and, restricting, the, tools, with, which, spartan, houses, could, be, built, to, encourage, simplicity, archaeological, evidence, of, foreign, wares, postdates, the, eighth, century, with, a, decline, in, imports, met, by, local, production, by, the, sixth, century, the, alleged, simplicity, of, spartan, dwellings, evidently, did, not, extend, to, their, interiors, and, spartans, were, famous, across, greece, for, the, jewellery, worn, by, spartan, women, their, number, of, slaves, and, horses, and, their, dominance, at, the, expensive, sport, of, chariot, racing, at, pan, hellenic, games, while, most, male, spartan, citizens, affected, a, generally, consistent, and, relatively, inexpensive, form, of, dress, at, home, spartans, on, campaign, showed, extreme, wealth, from, the, expense, of, their, crimson, dyes, to, the, polish, of, their, armour, however, while, xenophon, claims, this, austere, dress, also, came, from, lycurgus, art, from, laconia, implies, adoption, after, 500, bc, consistent, with, thucydides, claim, that, spartans, wore, complex, and, luxurious, clothing, until, not, long, ago, lycurgus, is, also, supposed, to, have, instituted, the, spartan, practice, of, staged, bride, capture, where, the, bride, rather, than, being, processed, to, the, groom, s, home, for, a, wedding, ceremony, with, feast, was, instead, ritually, seized, by, the, groom, and, the, marriage, consummated, without, feast, the, seventh, century, spartan, poet, alcman, makes, no, mention, of, such, customs, and, composed, wedding, hymns, reflecting, the, more, common, greek, wedding, processions, spartan, wedding, customs, therefore, also, postdate, lycurgus, emerging, some, time, before, 500, bc, the, further, claim, in, plutarch, s, moralia, that, lycurgus, prohibited, dowries, altogether, has, no, basis, lycurgus, is, also, said, to, have, instituted, a, system, of, wife, sharing, as, a, pronatalist, and, eugenicist, policy, if, such, wife, sharing, existed, it, is, likely, a, product, of, spartan, population, decline, in, the, fifth, century, bc, plutarch, also, credits, lycurgus, with, sumptuary, laws, on, burials, archaeological, evidence, broadly, supports, the, notion, that, spartans, practiced, uniform, burial, without, grave, goods, albeit, with, exceptions, for, generals, and, olympic, victors, however, lycurgus, is, also, said, to, have, banned, lamentations, and, allowed, burials, near, temples, burials, near, temples, were, common, in, archaic, greece, before, being, prohibited, by, most, cities, sparta, merely, retained, the, practice, the, earliest, spartan, art, and, poems, also, still, mention, lamenting, mourners, implying, that, such, a, ban, likely, postdates, lycurgus, and, was, introduced, c, 600, bc, moreover, any, ban, on, grave, goods, must, postdate, a, grave, also, c, 600, bc, containing, pottery, grave, goods, further, claims, that, lycurgus, required, the, burial, of, fallen, spartan, soldiers, abroad, are, not, compatible, with, archaeological, evidence, showing, that, the, first, certain, mass, grave, for, spartan, battlefield, losses, was, at, plataea, the, education, of, spartan, boys, in, the, agoge, less, anachronistically, the, paideia, was, also, attributed, to, an, initiative, of, lycurgus, to, equalise, spartan, citizens, socially, by, raising, them, without, outside, family, and, clan, loyalties, though, the, story, is, rejected, by, plutarch, lycurgus, is, also, said, to, have, instituted, the, crypteia, a, select, group, of, young, men, tasked, with, clandestinely, killing, helots, in, the, night, both, the, agoge, and, crypteia, likely, emerged, some, time, during, the, seventh, century, alongside, the, institution, of, the, ephorate, the, education, of, spartan, women, mainly, focusing, on, physical, fitness, or, supposedly, physical, fitness, to, produce, healthy, children, for, eugenic, purposes, was, similarly, attributed, to, lycurgus, in, spartan, society, lycurgus, and, his, laws, were, received, as, the, creator, of, the, spartan, way, of, life, xenophon, s, pro, spartan, spartan, constitution, unreservedly, regard, as, the, spartan, legislator, par, excellence, who, arranged, the, spartan, way, of, life, once, and, for, all, for, these, achievements, which, they, viewed, as, having, facilitated, the, emergence, of, sparta, as, the, most, powerful, state, in, greece, lycurgus, was, honoured, with, a, hero, cult, which, may, have, developed, slowly, into, the, roman, imperial, period, into, full, godhood, his, temple, and, sanctuary, according, to, pausanias, included, a, grave, for, his, son, with, the, name, eukosmos, referring, to, good, order, with, the, graves, of, the, spartan, dual, monarchy, s, founders, wives, nearby, the, idealisation, of, sparta, called, the, spartan, mirage, also, drove, praise, of, lycurgus, in, other, greek, states, the, tradition, of, a, timeless, legislator, with, his, divinely, inspired, or, at, least, sanctioned, laws, gave, sparta, s, constitution, greater, legitimacy, while, also, making, it, inflexible, even, attempts, to, reform, spartan, life, during, the, hellenistic, period, by, spartan, monarchs, agis, iv, and, cleomenes, iii, were, viewed, in, their, time, as, returning, to, lycurgan, tradition, rather, than, an, innovation, the, stories, of, lycurgus, were, constantly, reinvented, for, each, spartan, generation, the, decline, of, sparta, through, to, hellenistic, times, saw, lycurgus, praise, extended, to, praise, him, for, having, creating, an, ideal, sparta, free, from, the, moral, and, political, decay, of, the, real, one, admiration, of, the, customs, of, sparta, supposed, to, be, established, by, lycurgus, survived, with, a, break, during, the, second, century, when, sparta, was, part, of, the, achaean, league, continuously, into, the, sparta, of, the, roman, empire, aristotle, for, example, praised, the, lycurgan, agoge, as, a, form, of, universal, education, especially, in, the, way, it, supported, the, stability, of, the, spartan, state, into, the, roman, period, sparta, received, privileged, treatment, from, the, romans, as, in, part, a, means, to, preserve, greek, traditions, to, display, to, tourists, while, this, touristic, sparta, at, times, veered, toward, the, extreme, it, also, cultivated, its, lycurgan, inheritance, by, means, of, architecture, theatre, and, retention, of, distinctive, political, institutions, the, plutarchian, comparison, between, the, paired, lives, of, lycurgus, and, numa, the, early, roman, lawgiver, and, king, for, example, judged, lycurgus, favourably, compared, to, the, roman, by, emphasising, lycurgan, education, and, pronatalism, another, argument, for, lycurgan, superiority, was, also, that, sparta, declined, as, it, supposedly, deviated, from, lycurgus, settlements, while, rome, flourished, as, it, similarly, deviated, from, numa, s, ideals, in, the, end, for, plutarch, lycurgus, was, seen, as, a, more, important, political, theorist, than, plato, and, as, one, of, the, most, famous, moral, and, effective, legislators, of, the, greek, tradition, the, main, elements, of, lycurgus, legacy, are, through, the, laws, attributed, to, him, in, the, modern, world, this, took, on, a, number, of, aspects, the, stability, of, the, lacedaemonian, state, from, lycurgus, balanced, constitution, universal, male, citizen, conscription, and, contribution, via, the, syssitia, economic, freedom, for, citizens, by, their, possession, of, sufficient, land, and, helots, to, meet, their, needs, and, austere, politics, for, the, common, good, the, republican, views, of, niccol, machiavelli, trended, toward, the, lycurgan, mixed, constitution, but, this, was, not, necessarily, a, through, line, in, renaissance, european, political, thought, other, thinkers, of, the, period, hailed, lycurgan, politics, as, building, a, stable, polity, dedicated, to, simplicity, unity, and, the, communal, interest, attributing, to, the, spartans, not, necessarily, rightly, universal, education, and, equality, among, citizens, while, also, noting, the, cruelty, of, the, agoge, and, denigration, of, autonomy, especially, in, contrast, to, democratic, athens, charles, rollin, a, french, educator, produced, an, enduring, and, admiring, conception, of, lycurgus, as, having, created, the, rule, of, law, the, mixed, constitution, equality, and, universal, education, the, philosopher, jean, jacques, rousseau, who, derived, most, of, his, knowledge, of, lycurgus, from, plutarch, s, biography, viewed, the, figure, positively, as, standing, for, an, austere, civil, morality, acting, for, the, collective, good, this, view, of, lycurgus, and, sparta, saw, him, associate, lycurgus, reforms, with, the, general, will, positive, views, of, sparta, pervaded, some, articles, in, the, encyclop, die, but, this, was, not, shared, by, all, authors, diderot, the, main, editor, of, the, encyclop, die, was, more, pessimistic, saying, that, lycurgan, laws, created, monks, bearing, arms, while, branding, the, system, as, a, whole, an, atrocity, and, incompatible, with, a, large, commercial, state, the, branding, of, lycurguan, sparta, as, a, dismal, monastery, was, widely, but, not, universally, shared, among, the, philosophes, similar, negative, views, were, expressed, by, the, american, founder, john, adams, who, saw, lycurgus, as, having, doomed, his, own, people, to, poverty, and, futile, militarism, however, he, also, praised, the, lycurgan, as, well, as, the, polybian, mixed, constitution, in, defense, of, the, constitutions, as, did, james, madison, in, the, federalist, papers, number, 63, nationalist, views, of, spartan, society, which, praised, spartan, eugenicism, and, militarism, became, common, in, germany, in, the, later, nineteenth, century, through, to, the, nazi, regime, such, views, however, were, not, unanimous, the, german, classicist, karl, julius, beloch, for, example, was, one, of, the, first, to, take, a, highly, critical, view, of, sparta, suggesting, that, lycurgus, was, a, fiction, and, his, great, rhetra, was, a, fabrication, in, the, aftermath, of, the, first, world, war, german, nationalism, embraced, sparta, and, lycurgus, seeing, it, as, a, locus, of, heroism, physicality, racial, purity, and, struggle, such, themes, complemented, fascist, and, nazi, ideology, painting, sparta, as, a, proto, national, socialist, state, defeat, in, the, second, world, war, largely, ended, such, hagiography
