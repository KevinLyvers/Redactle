johannes, diderik, van, der, waals, dutch, pronunciation, 23, november, 1837, 8, march, 1923, was, a, dutch, theoretical, physicist, and, thermodynamicist, famous, for, his, pioneering, work, on, the, equation, of, state, for, gases, and, liquids, van, der, waals, started, his, career, as, a, schoolteacher, he, became, the, first, physics, professor, of, the, university, of, amsterdam, when, in, 1877, the, old, athenaeum, was, upgraded, to, municipal, university, van, der, waals, won, the, 1910, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, work, on, the, equation, of, state, for, gases, and, liquids, his, name, is, primarily, associated, with, the, van, der, waals, equation, of, state, that, describes, the, behavior, of, gases, and, their, condensation, to, the, liquid, phase, his, name, is, also, associated, with, van, der, waals, forces, forces, between, stable, molecules, with, van, der, waals, molecules, small, molecular, clusters, bound, by, van, der, waals, forces, and, with, van, der, waals, radii, sizes, of, molecules, james, clerk, maxwell, once, said, that, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, the, name, of, van, der, waals, will, soon, be, among, the, foremost, in, molecular, science, in, his, 1873, thesis, van, der, waals, noted, the, non, ideality, of, real, gases, and, attributed, it, to, the, existence, of, intermolecular, interactions, he, introduced, the, first, equation, of, state, derived, by, the, assumption, of, a, finite, volume, occupied, by, the, constituent, molecules, spearheaded, by, ernst, mach, and, wilhelm, ostwald, a, strong, philosophical, current, that, denied, the, existence, of, molecules, arose, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, molecular, existence, was, considered, unproven, and, the, molecular, hypothesis, unnecessary, at, the, time, van, der, waals, s, thesis, was, written, 1873, the, molecular, structure, of, fluids, had, not, been, accepted, by, most, physicists, and, liquid, and, vapor, were, often, considered, as, chemically, distinct, but, van, der, waals, s, work, affirmed, the, reality, of, molecules, and, allowed, an, assessment, of, their, size, and, attractive, strength, his, new, formula, revolutionized, the, study, of, equations, of, state, by, comparing, his, equation, of, state, with, experimental, data, van, der, waals, was, able, to, obtain, estimates, for, the, actual, size, of, molecules, and, the, strength, of, their, mutual, attraction, the, effect, of, van, der, waals, s, work, on, molecular, physics, in, the, 20th, century, was, direct, and, fundamental, by, introducing, parameters, characterizing, molecular, size, and, attraction, in, constructing, his, equation, of, state, van, der, waals, set, the, tone, for, modern, molecular, science, that, molecular, aspects, such, as, size, shape, attraction, and, multipolar, interactions, should, form, the, basis, for, mathematical, formulations, of, the, thermodynamic, and, transport, properties, of, fluids, is, presently, considered, an, axiom, with, the, help, of, the, van, der, waals, s, equation, of, state, the, critical, point, parameters, of, gases, could, be, accurately, predicted, from, thermodynamic, measurements, made, at, much, higher, temperatures, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and, helium, subsequently, succumbed, to, liquefaction, heike, kamerlingh, onnes, was, significantly, influenced, by, the, pioneering, work, of, van, der, waals, in, 1908, onnes, became, the, first, to, make, liquid, helium, this, led, directly, to, his, 1911, discovery, of, superconductivity, johannes, diderik, van, der, waals, was, born, on, 23, november, 1837, in, leiden, in, the, netherlands, he, was, the, eldest, of, ten, children, born, to, jacobus, van, der, waals, and, elisabeth, van, den, berg, his, father, was, a, carpenter, in, leiden, as, was, usual, for, all, girls, and, working, class, boys, in, the, 19th, century, he, did, not, go, to, the, kind, of, secondary, school, that, would, have, given, him, the, right, to, enter, university, instead, he, went, to, a, school, of, advanced, primary, education, which, he, finished, at, the, age, of, fifteen, he, then, became, a, teacher, s, apprentice, in, an, elementary, school, between, 1856, and, 1861, he, followed, courses, and, gained, the, necessary, qualifications, to, become, a, primary, school, teacher, and, head, teacher, in, 1862, he, began, to, attend, lectures, in, mathematics, physics, and, astronomy, at, the, university, in, his, city, of, birth, although, he, was, not, qualified, to, be, enrolled, as, a, regular, student, in, part, because, of, his, lack, of, education, in, classical, languages, however, leiden, university, had, a, provision, that, enabled, outside, students, to, take, up, to, four, courses, a, year, in, 1863, the, dutch, government, started, a, new, kind, of, secondary, school, hbs, a, school, aiming, at, the, children, of, the, higher, middle, classes, van, der, waals, at, that, time, head, of, an, elementary, school, wanted, to, become, a, hbs, teacher, in, mathematics, and, physics, and, spent, two, years, studying, in, his, spare, time, for, the, required, examinations, in, 1865, he, was, appointed, as, a, physics, teacher, at, the, hbs, in, deventer, and, in, 1866, he, received, such, a, position, in, the, hague, which, was, close, enough, to, leiden, to, allow, van, der, waals, to, resume, his, courses, at, the, university, there, in, september, 1865, just, before, moving, to, deventer, van, der, waals, married, the, eighteen, year, old, anna, magdalena, smit, van, der, waals, still, lacked, the, knowledge, of, the, classical, languages, that, would, have, given, him, the, right, to, enter, university, as, a, regular, student, and, to, take, examinations, however, it, so, happened, that, the, law, regulating, the, university, entrance, was, changed, and, dispensation, from, the, study, of, classical, languages, could, be, given, by, the, minister, of, education, van, der, waals, was, given, this, dispensation, and, passed, the, qualification, exams, in, physics, and, mathematics, for, doctoral, studies, at, leiden, university, on, june, 14, 1873, he, defended, his, doctoral, thesis, over, de, continu, teit, van, den, gas, en, vloeistoftoestand, on, the, continuity, of, the, gaseous, and, liquid, state, under, pieter, rijke, in, the, thesis, he, introduced, the, concepts, of, molecular, volume, and, molecular, attraction, in, september, 1877, van, der, waals, was, appointed, the, first, professor, of, physics, at, the, newly, founded, municipal, university, of, amsterdam, two, of, his, notable, colleagues, were, the, physical, chemist, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, and, the, biologist, hugo, de, vries, until, his, retirement, at, the, age, of, 70, van, der, waals, remained, at, the, amsterdam, university, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, johannes, diderik, van, der, waals, jr, who, also, was, a, theoretical, physicist, in, 1910, at, the, age, of, 72, van, der, waals, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, he, died, at, the, age, of, 85, on, march, 8, 1923, the, main, interest, of, van, der, waals, was, in, the, field, of, thermodynamics, he, was, influenced, by, rudolf, clausius, s, 1857, treatise, entitled, ber, die, art, der, bewegung, welche, wir, w, rme, nennen, on, the, kind, of, motion, which, we, call, heat, van, der, waals, was, later, greatly, influenced, by, the, writings, of, james, clerk, maxwell, ludwig, boltzmann, and, willard, gibbs, clausius, s, work, led, him, to, look, for, an, explanation, of, thomas, andrews, s, experiments, that, had, revealed, in, 1869, the, existence, of, critical, temperatures, in, fluids, he, managed, to, give, a, semi, quantitative, description, of, the, phenomena, of, condensation, and, critical, temperatures, in, his, 1873, thesis, entitled, over, de, continu, teit, van, den, gas, en, vloeistoftoestand, on, the, continuity, of, the, gas, and, liquid, state, this, dissertation, represented, a, hallmark, in, physics, and, was, immediately, recognized, as, such, e, g, by, james, clerk, maxwell, who, reviewed, it, in, nature, in, a, laudatory, manner, in, this, thesis, he, derived, the, equation, of, state, bearing, his, name, this, work, gave, a, model, in, which, the, liquid, and, the, gas, phase, of, a, substance, merge, into, each, other, in, a, continuous, manner, it, shows, that, the, two, phases, are, of, the, same, nature, in, deriving, his, equation, of, state, van, der, waals, assumed, not, only, the, existence, of, molecules, the, existence, of, atoms, was, disputed, at, the, time, but, also, that, they, are, of, finite, size, and, attract, each, other, since, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, postulate, an, intermolecular, force, however, rudimentary, such, a, force, is, now, sometimes, called, a, van, der, waals, force, a, second, major, discovery, was, the, 1880, the, law, of, corresponding, states, which, showed, that, the, van, der, waals, equation, of, state, can, be, expressed, as, a, simple, function, of, the, critical, pressure, critical, volume, and, critical, temperature, this, general, form, is, applicable, to, all, substances, see, van, der, waals, equation, the, compound, specific, constants, a, and, b, in, the, original, equation, are, replaced, by, universal, compound, independent, quantities, it, was, this, law, which, served, as, a, guide, during, experiments, which, ultimately, led, to, the, liquefaction, of, hydrogen, by, james, dewar, in, 1898, and, of, helium, by, heike, kamerlingh, onnes, in, 1908, in, 1890, van, der, waals, published, a, treatise, on, the, theory, of, binary, solutions, in, the, archives, n, erlandaises, by, relating, his, equation, of, state, with, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, in, the, form, first, proposed, by, willard, gibbs, he, was, able, to, arrive, at, a, graphical, representation, of, his, mathematical, formulations, in, the, form, of, a, surface, which, he, called, psi, surface, following, gibbs, who, used, the, greek, letter, for, the, free, energy, of, a, system, with, different, phases, in, equilibrium, mention, should, also, be, made, of, van, der, waals, s, theory, of, capillarity, which, in, its, basic, form, first, appeared, in, 1893, in, contrast, to, the, mechanical, perspective, on, the, subject, provided, earlier, by, pierre, simon, laplace, van, der, waals, took, a, thermodynamic, approach, this, was, controversial, at, the, time, since, the, existence, of, molecules, and, their, permanent, rapid, motion, were, not, universally, accepted, before, jean, baptiste, perrin, s, experimental, verification, of, albert, einstein, s, theoretical, explanation, of, brownian, motion, he, married, his, wife, anna, magdalena, smit, in, 1865, and, the, couple, had, three, daughters, anne, madeleine, jacqueline, e, van, der, waals, johanna, diderica, and, one, son, the, physicist, johannes, diderik, van, der, waals, jr, who, also, worked, at, the, university, of, amsterdam, jacqueline, was, a, poet, of, some, note, van, der, waals, s, nephew, peter, van, der, waals, was, a, cabinet, maker, and, a, leading, figure, in, the, sapperton, gloucestershire, school, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, his, wife, died, of, tuberculosis, at, 34, years, old, in, 1881, after, becoming, a, widower, van, der, waals, never, remarried, and, was, so, shaken, by, the, death, of, his, wife, that, he, did, not, publish, anything, for, about, a, decade, he, died, in, amsterdam, on, march, 8, 1923, one, year, after, his, daughter, jacqueline, had, died, van, der, waals, received, numerous, honors, and, distinctions, besides, winning, the, 1910, nobel, prize, in, physics, he, was, awarded, an, honorary, doctorate, of, the, university, of, cambridge, was, made, honorary, member, of, the, imperial, society, of, naturalists, of, moscow, the, royal, irish, academy, and, the, american, philosophical, society, 1916, corresponding, member, of, the, institut, de, france, and, the, royal, academy, of, sciences, of, berlin, associate, member, of, the, royal, academy, of, sciences, of, belgium, and, foreign, member, of, the, chemical, society, of, london, the, national, academy, of, sciences, of, the, united, states, 1913, and, of, the, accademia, dei, lincei, of, rome, van, der, waals, became, a, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1875, from, 1896, until, 1912, he, was, secretary, of, this, society, he, was, furthermore, elected, as, honorary, member, of, the, netherlands, chemical, society, in, 1912, minor, planet, 32893, van, der, waals, is, named, in, his, honor, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, the, name, of, van, der, waals, will, soon, be, among, the, foremost, in, molecular, science, it, will, be, perfectly, clear, that, in, all, my, studies, i, was, quite, convinced, of, the, real, existence, of, molecules, that, i, never, regarded, them, as, a, figment, of, my, imagination, nor, even, as, mere, centres, of, force, effects, i, considered, them, to, be, the, actual, bodies, thus, what, we, term, body, in, daily, speech, ought, better, to, be, called, pseudo, body, it, is, an, aggregate, of, bodies, and, empty, space, we, do, not, know, the, nature, of, a, molecule, consisting, of, a, single, chemical, atom, it, would, be, premature, to, seek, to, answer, this, question, but, to, admit, this, ignorance, in, no, way, impairs, the, belief, in, its, real, existence, when, i, began, my, studies, i, had, the, feeling, that, i, was, almost, alone, in, holding, that, view, and, when, as, occurred, already, in, my, 1873, treatise, i, determined, their, number, in, one, gram, mol, their, size, and, the, nature, of, their, action, i, was, strengthened, in, my, opinion, yet, still, there, often, arose, within, me, the, question, whether, in, the, final, analysis, a, molecule, is, a, figment, of, the, imagination, and, the, entire, molecular, theory, too, and, now, i, do, not, think, it, any, exaggeration, to, state, that, the, real, existence, of, molecules, is, universally, assumed, by, physicists, many, of, those, who, opposed, it, most, have, ultimately, been, won, over, and, my, theory, may, have, been, a, contributory, factor, and, precisely, this, i, feel, is, a, step, forward, anyone, acquainted, with, the, writings, of, boltzmann, and, willard, gibbs, will, admit, that, physicists, carrying, great, authority, believe, that, the, complex, phenomena, of, the, heat, theory, can, only, be, interpreted, in, this, way, it, is, a, great, pleasure, for, me, that, an, increasing, number, of, younger, physicists, find, the, inspiration, for, their, work, in, studies, and, contemplations, of, the, molecular, theory
