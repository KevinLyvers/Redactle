council, in, 2006, alvin, shuster, former, foreign, editor, of, the, los, angeles, times, asked, soros, how, does, one, go, from, an, immigrant, to, a, financier, when, did, you, realize, that, you, knew, how, to, make, money, soros, replied, well, i, had, a, variety, of, jobs, and, i, ended, up, selling, fancy, goods, on, the, seaside, souvenir, shops, and, i, thought, that, s, really, not, what, i, was, cut, out, to, do, so, i, wrote, to, every, managing, director, in, every, merchant, bank, in, london, got, just, one, or, two, replies, and, eventually, that, s, how, i, got, a, job, in,

developed, the, theory, of, reflexivity, to, extend, the, ideas, of, his, tutor, at, the, london, school, of, economics, karl, popper, reflexivity, posits, that, market, values, are, often, driven, by, the, fallible, ideas, of, participants, not, only, by, the, economic, fundamentals, of, the, situation, ideas, and, events, influence, each, other, in, reflexive, feedback, loops, soros, argued, that, this, process, leads, to, markets, having, procyclical, virtuous, or, vicious, cycles, of, boom, and, bust, in, contrast, to, the, equilibrium, predictions, of, more, standard, neoclassical, economics, from, 1963, to, 1973, soros, s, experience, as, a, vice, president, at, arnhold, and, s, bleichroeder, resulted, in, little, enthusiasm, for, the, job, business, was, slack, following, the, introduction, of, the, interest, equalization, tax, which, undermined, the, viability, of, soros, s, european, trading, he, spent, the, years, from, 1963, to, 1966, with, his, main, focus, on, the,

formed, the, basis, of, the, soros, fund, george, soros, and, jim, rogers, received, returns, on, their, share, of, capital, and, 20, percent, of, the, profits, each, year, in, 1970, soros, founded, soros, fund, management, and, became, its, chairman, among, those, who, held, senior, positions, there, at, various, times, were, jim, rogers, stanley, druckenmiller, mark, schwartz, keith, anderson, and, soros, s, two, sons, in, 1973, due, to, perceived, conflicts, of, interest, limiting, his, ability, to, run, the, two, funds, soros, resigned, from, the, management, of, the, double, eagle, fund, he, then, established, the, soros, fund, and, gave, investors, in, the, double, eagle, fund, the, option, of, transferring, to, that, or, staying, with, arnhold, and, s, bleichroeder, it, was, later, renamed, the, quantum, fund, after, the, physical, theory, of, quantum, mechanics, by, that, time, the, value, of, the, fund, had, grown, to, 12m, only, a, small, proportion, of, which, was, soros, s, own, money, he, and, jim, rogers, reinvested, their, returns, from, the, fund, and, also, a, large, part, of, their, 20, performance, fees, thereby, expanding, their, stake, by, 1981, the, fund, had, grown, to, 400m, and, then, a, 22, loss, in, that, year, and, substantial, redemptions, by, some, of, the, investors, reduced, it, to, 200m, in, july, 2011, soros, announced, that, he, had, returned, funds, from, outside, investors, money, valued, at, 1, billion, and, instead, invested, funds, from, his, 24, 5, billion, family, fortune, due, to, changes, in, u, s, securities, and, exchange, commission, disclosure, rules, which, he, felt, would, compromise, his, duties, of, confidentiality, to, his, investors, the, fund, had, at, that, time, averaged, over, 20, per, year, compound, returns, in, 2013, the, quantum, fund, made, 5, 5, billion, making, it, again, the, most, successful, hedge, fund, in, history, since, its, inception, in, 1973, the, fund, has, generated, 40, billion,

wednesday, of, september, 1992, soros, had, recognized, the, unfavorable, position, of, the, united, kingdom, in, the, european, exchange, rate, mechanism, for, soros, the, rate, at, which, the, united, kingdom, was, brought, into, the, european, exchange, rate, mechanism, was, too, high, their, inflation, was, also, much, too, high, triple, the, german, rate, and, british, interest, rates, were, hurting, their, asset, prices, by, september, 16, 1992, the, day, of, black, wednesday, soros, s, fund, had, sold, short, more, than, 10, billion, in, pounds, profiting, from, the, uk, government, s, reluctance, to, either, raise, its, interest, rates, to, levels, comparable, to, those, of, other, european, exchange, rate, mechanism, countries, or, float, its, currency, finally, the, uk, withdrew, from, the, european, exchange, rate, mechanism, devaluing, the, pound, soros, s, profit, on, the, bet, was, estimated, at, over, 1, billion, he, was, dubbed, the, man, who, broke, the, bank, of, england, the, estimated, cost, of, black, wednesday, to, the, uk, treasury, was, 3, 4, billion, stanley, druckenmiller, who, traded, under, soros, originally, saw, the, weakness, in, the, pound, and, stated, contribution, was, pushing, him, to, take, a, gigantic, position, on, october, 26, 1992, the, new, york, times, quoted, soros, as, saying, our, total, position, by, black, wednesday, had, to, be, worth, almost, 10, billion, we, planned, to, sell, more, than, that, in, fact, when, norman, lamont, said, just, before, the, devaluation, that, he, would, borrow, nearly, 15, billion, to, defend, sterling, we, were, amused, because, that, was, about, how, much, we, wanted, to, sell, soros, was, believed, to, have, traded, billions, of, finnish, markkas, on, february, 5, 1996, in, anticipation, of, selling, them, short, the, markka, had, been, put, floating, as, a, result, of, the, early, 1990s, depression, the, bank, of, finland, and, the, finnish, government, commented, at, the, time, they, believed, that, a, conspiracy, was, impossible, in, 1997, during, the, asian, financial, crisis, the, prime, minister, of, malaysia, mahathir, mohamad, accused, soros, of, using, the, wealth, under, his, control, to, punish, the, association, of, southeast, asian, nations, asean, for, welcoming, myanmar, as, a, member, with, a, history, of, antisemitic, remarks, mahathir, made, specific, reference, to, soros, s, jewish, background, it, is, a, jew, who, triggered, the, currency, plunge, and, implied, soros, was, orchestrating, the, crash, as, part, of, a, larger, jewish, conspiracy, nine, years, later, in, 2006, mahathir, met, with, soros, and, afterward, stated, that, he, accepted, that, soros, had, not, been, responsible, for, the, crisis, in, 1998, s, the, crisis, of, global, capitalism, open, society, endangered, soros, explained, his, role, in, the, crisis, as, follows, the, financial, crisis, that, originated, in, thailand, in, 1997, was, particularly, unnerving, because, of, its, scope, and, severity, by, the, beginning, of, 1997, it, was, clear, to, soros, fund, management, that, the, discrepancy, between, the, trade, account, and, the, capital, account, was, becoming, untenable, we, sold, short, the, thai, baht, and, the, malaysian, ringgit, early, in, 1997, with, maturities, ranging, from, six, months, to, a, year, that, is, we, entered, into, contracts, to, deliver, at, future, dates, thai, baht, and, malaysian, ringgit, that, we, did, not, currently, hold, subsequently, prime, minister, mahathir, of, malaysia, accused, me, of, causing, the, crisis, a, wholly, unfounded, accusation, we, were, not, sellers, of, the, currency, during, or, several, months, before, the, crisis, on, the, contrary, we, were, buyers, when, the, currencies, began, to, decline, we, were, purchasing, ringgits, to, realize, the, profits, on, our, earlier, speculation, much, too, soon, as, it, turned, out, we, left, most, of, the, potential, gain, on, the, table, because, we, were, afraid, that, mahathir, would, impose, capital, controls, he, did, so, but, much, later, in, 1999, economist, paul, krugman, was, critical, of, soros, s, effect, on, financial, markets, obody, who, has, read, a, business, magazine, in, the, last, few, years, can, be, unaware, that, these, days, there, really, are, investors, who, not, only, move, money, in, anticipation, of, a, currency, crisis, but, actually, do, their, best, to, trigger, that, crisis, for, fun, and, profit, these, new, actors, on, the, scene, do, not, yet, have, a, standard, name, my, proposed, term, is, soroi, in, an, interview, concerning, the, late, 2000s, recession, soros, referred, to, it, as, the, most, serious, crisis, since, the, 1930s, according, to, soros, market, fundamentalism, with, its, assumption, that, markets, will, correct, themselves, with, no, need, for, government, intervention, in, financial, affairs, has, been, some, kind, of, an, ideological, excess, in, soros, s, view, the, markets, moods, a, mood, of, the, markets, being, a, prevailing, bias, or, optimism, pessimism, with, which, the, markets, look, at, reality, actually, can, reinforce, themselves, so, that, there, are, these, initially, self, reinforcing, but, eventually, unsustainable, and, self, defeating, boom, bust, sequences, or, bubbles, in, reaction, to, the, late, 2000s, recession, he, founded, the, institute, for, new, economic, thinking, in, october, 2009, this, is, a, think, tank, composed, of, international, economic, business, and, financial, experts, who, are, mandated, to, investigate, radical, new, approaches, to, organizing, the, international, economic, and, financial, system, in, 1988, soros, was, contacted, by, a, french, financier, named, georges, p, bereau, who, asked, him, to, participate, in, an, effort, to, assemble, a, group, of, investors, to, purchase, a, large, number, of, shares, in, soci, t, g, n, rale, a, leading, french, bank, that, was, part, of, a, privatization, program, something, instituted, by, the, new, government, under, jacques, chirac, soros, eventually, decided, against, participating, in, the, group, effort, opting, to, personally, move, forward, with, his, strategy, of, accumulating, shares, in, four, french, companies, soci, t, g, n, rale, as, well, as, suez, paribas, and, the, compagnie,

business, but, he, did, possess, knowledge, that, a, group, of, investors, was, planning, a, takeover, attempt, initial, investigations, found, soros, innocent, and, no, charges, were, brought, forward, however, the, case, was, reopened, a, few, years, later, and, the, french, supreme, court, confirmed, the, conviction, on, june, 14, 2006, although, it, reduced, the, penalty, to, 940, 000, soros, denied, any, wrongdoing, saying, news, of, the, takeover, was, public, knowledge, and, it, was, documented, that, his, intent, to, acquire, shares, of, the, company, predated, his, own, awareness, of, the, takeover, in, december, 2006, he, appealed, to, the, european, court, of, human, rights, on, various, grounds, including, that, the, 14, year, delay, in, bringing, the, case, to, trial, precluded, a, fair, hearing, on, the, basis, of, article, 7, of, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, stating, that, no, person, may, be, punished, for, an, act, that, was, not, a, criminal, offense, at, the, time, that, it, was, committed, the, court, agreed, to, hear, the, appeal, in, october, 2011, the, court, rejected, his, appeal, in, a, 4, 3, decision, saying, that, soros,

government, spent, millions, of, dollars, on, a, poster, campaign, demonizing, soros, according, to, anthropologist, ivan, kalmar, many, of, his, most, outspoken, enemies, inside, and, outside,

mailbox, at, soros, s, home, in, katonah, new, york, on, october, 22, 2018, as, part, of, the, october, 2018, united, states, mail, bombing, attempts, the, package, was, discovered, by, a, caretaker, who, removed, it, and, notified, authorities, it, was, photographed, and, exploded, by, the, fbi, which, launched, an, investigation, for, several, days, afterward, similar, bombs, were, mailed, to,

august, 2019, sayoc, was, sentenced, to, 20, years, in, prison, for, mailing, 16, pipe, bombs, to, 13, victims, none, of, the, devices, exploded, soros, s, writings, focus, heavily, on, the, concept, of, reflexivity, where, the, biases, of, individuals, enter, into, market, transactions, potentially, changing, the, fundamentals, of, the, economy, soros, argues, that, different, principles, apply, in, markets, depending, on, whether, they, are, in, a, near, to, equilibrium, or, a, far, from, equilibrium, state, he, argues, that, when, markets, are, rising, or, falling, rapidly, they, are, typically, marked, by, disequilibrium, rather, than, equilibrium, and, that, the, conventional, economic, theory, of, the, market, the, efficient, market, hypothesis, does, not, apply, in, these, situations, soros, has, popularized, the, concepts, of, dynamic, disequilibrium, static, disequilibrium, and, near, equilibrium, conditions, he, has, stated, that, his, own, financial, success, has, been, attributable, to, the, edge, accorded, by, his, understanding, of, the, action, of, the, reflexive, effect, reflexivity, is, based, on, three, main, ideas, a, recent, example, circa, 2008, of, reflexivity, in, modern, financial, markets, is, that, of, the, debt, and, equity, of, housing, markets, lenders, began, to, make, more, money, available, to, more, people, in, the, 1990s, to, buy, houses, more, people, bought, houses, with, this, larger, amount, of, money, thus, increasing, the, prices, of, these, houses, lenders, looked, at, their, balance, sheets, which, not, only, showed, that, they, had, made, more, loans, but, that, the, collaterals, backing, the, loans, the, value, of, the, houses, had, gone, up, because, more, money, was, chasing, the, same, amount, of, housing, relatively, thus, they, lent, out, more, money, because, their, balance, sheets, looked, good, and, prices, rose, higher, still, this, was, further, amplified, by, public, policy, in, the, us, home, loans, were, guaranteed, by, the, federal, government, many, national, governments, saw, home, ownership, as, a, positive, outcome, and, so, introduced, grants, for, first, time, home, buyers, and, other, financial, subsidies, such, as, the, exemption, of, a, primary, residence, from, capital, gains, taxation, these, further, encouraged, house, purchases, leading, to, further, price, rises, and, further, relaxation, of, lending, standards, the, concept, of, reflexivity, attempts, to, explain, why, markets, moving, from, one, equilibrium, state, to, another, tend, to, overshoot, or, undershoot, soros, s, theories, were, originally, dismissed, by, economists, but, have, received, more, attention, after, the, 2008, crash, including, becoming, the, focus, of, an, issue, of, the, journal, of, economic, methodology, the, notion, of, reflexivity, provides, an, explanation, of, the, theories, of, complexity, economics, as, developed, at, the, santa, fe, institute, although, soros, had, not, publicized, his, views, at, the, time, the, discipline, was, originally, developed, there, in, the, 1980s, although, the, primary, manifestation, of, the, reflexive, process, that, soros, discusses, is, its, effects, in, the, financial, markets, he, has, also, explored, its, effects, in, politics, he, has, stated, that, whereas, the, greatest, threats, to, the, open, society, in, the, past, were, from, communism, and, fascism, as, discussed, in, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, by, his, mentor, karl, popper, the, largest, current, threat, is, from, market, fundamentalism, he, has, suggested, that, the, contemporary, domination, of, world, politics, and, world, trade, by, the, united, states, is, a, reflexive, phenomenon, insofar, as, the, success, of, military, and, financial, coercion, feeds, back, to, encourage, increasingly, intense, applications, of, the, same, policies, to, the, point, where, they, will, eventually, become, unsustainable, soros, argues, that, the, current, system, of, financial, speculation, undermines, healthy, economic, development, in, many, underdeveloped, countries, he, blames, many, of, the, world, s, problems, on, the, failures, inherent, in, what, he, characterizes, as, market, fundamentalism, soros, s, book, the, new, paradigm, for, financial, markets, may, 2008, described, a, superbubble, that, had, built, up, over, the, past, 25, years, and, was, ready, to, collapse, this, was, the, third, in, a, series, of, books, he, has, written, that, have, predicted, disaster, as, he, states, i, have, a, record, of, crying, wolf, i, did, it, first, in, the, alchemy, of, finance, in, 1987, then, in, the, crisis, of, global, capitalism, in, 1998, and, now, in, this, book, so, it, s, three, books, predicting, disaster, the, boy, cried, wolf, three, times, the, wolf, really, came, he, ascribes, his, own, success, to, being, able, to, recognize, when, his, predictions, are, wrong, i, m, only, rich, because, i, know, when, i, m, wrong, i, basically, have, survived, by, recognizing, my, mistakes, i, very, often, used, to, get, backaches, due, to, the, fact, that, i, was, wrong, whenever, you, are, wrong, you, have, to, fight, or, flight, when, make, the, decision, the, backache, goes, away, in, february, 2009, soros, said, the, world, financial, system, had, in, effect, disintegrated, adding, that, there, was, no, prospect, of, a, near, term, resolution, to, the, crisis, we, witnessed, the, collapse, of, the, financial, system, it, was, placed, on, life, support, and, it, s, still, on, life, support, there, s, no, sign, that, we, are, anywhere, near, a, bottom, in, january, 2016, at, an, economic, forum, in, sri, lanka, soros, predicted, a, financial, crisis, akin, to, 2008, based, on, the, state, of, the, global, currency, stock, and, commodity, markets, as, well, as, the, sinking, chinese, yuan, when, asked, what, he, thought, about, israel, in, the, new, yorker, soros, replied, i, don, t, deny, jews, the, right, to, a, national, existence, but, i, don, t, want, to, be, a, part, of, it, according, to, hacked, emails, released, in, 2016, soros, s, open, society, foundation, has, a, self, described, objective, of, challenging, israel, s, racist, and, anti, democratic, policies, in, international, forums, in, part, by, questioning, israel, s, reputation, as, a, democracy, he, has, funded, ngos, which, have, been, actively, critical, of, israeli, policies, including, groups, that, campaign, for, the, boycott, divestment, and, sanctions, movement, against, israel, speaking, before, a, 2003, conference, of, the, jewish, funders, network, soros, said, that, the, administrations, of, george, w, bush, in, the, u, s, and, ariel, sharon, in, israel, and, even, the, unintended, consequences, of, some, of, his, own, actions, were, partially, contributing, to, a, new, european, antisemitism, soros, citing, accusations, that, he, was, one, of, the, jewish, financiers, who, in, antisemitic, terms, ruled, the, world, by, proxy, suggested, that, if, the, direction, of, those, policies, were, changed, then, anti, semitism, would, diminish, abraham, foxman, national, director, of, the, anti, defamation, league, later, said, that, soros, s, comments, held, a, simplistic, view, were, counterproductive, biased, and, a, bigoted, perception, of, the, situation, and, blamed, the, victim, when, holding, jews, responsible, for, antisemitism, jewish, philanthropist, michael, steinhardt, who, arranged, for, soros, s, appearance, at, the, conference, clarified, that, george, soros, does, not, think, jews, should, be, hated, any, more, than, they, deserve, to, be, soros, has, also, said, that, jews, can, overcome, antisemitism, by, giv, up, on, the, tribalness, in, a, subsequent, article, for, the, new, york, review, of, books, soros, emphasized, that, i, do, not, subscribe, to, the, myths, propagated, by, enemies, of, israel, and, i, am, not, blaming, jews, for, anti, semitism, anti, semitism, predates, the, birth, of, israel, neither, israel, s, policies, nor, the, critics, of, those, policies, should, be, held, responsible, for, anti, semitism, at, the, same, time, i, do, believe, that, attitudes, toward, israel, are, influenced, by, israel, s, policies, and, attitudes, toward, the, jewish, community, are, influenced, by, the, pro, israel, lobby, s, success, in, suppressing, divergent, views, in, 2017, israeli, businessman, beny, steinmetz, filed, a, 10, million, lawsuit, against, soros, alleging, that, soros, had, influenced, the, government, of, guinea, to, freeze, steinmetz, s, company, bsg, resources, out, of, iron, ore, mining, contracts, in, the, african, country, due, to, long, standing, animus, toward, the, state, of, israel, steinmetz, claims, that, soros, engaged, in, a, smear, campaign, against, him, and, his, companies, and, blames, soros, for, scrutiny, of, him, by, american, israeli, swiss, and, guinean, authorities, soros, called, steinmetz, s, suit, frivolous, and, entirely, false, and, said, that, it, was, a, desperate, pr, stunt, meant, to, deflect, attention, from, bsgr, s, mounting, legal, problems, across, multiple, jurisdictions, during, an, award, ceremony, for, imre, kert, sz, soros, said, that, the, victims, of, violence, and, abuse, were, becoming, perpetrators, of, violence, suggesting, that, this, model, explained, israel, s, behavior, towards, the, palestinians, which, led, to, walkouts, and, soros, being, booed, in, july, 2017, a, hungarian, billboard, campaign, backed, by, prime, minister, viktor, orb, n, which, was, considered, to, be, anti, semitic, by, the, country, s, jewish, groups, vilified, soros, as, an, enemy, of, the, state, using, the, slogan, let, s, not, allow, soros, to, have, the, last, laugh, the, campaign, was, estimated, to, have, cost, 5, 7bn, forints, then, us, 21, million, according, to, the, israeli, ambassador, the, campaign, evokes, sad, memories, but, also, sows, hatred, and, fear, a, reference, to, hungary, s, role, in, the, deportation, of, 500, 000, jews, during, the, holocaust, lydia, gall, of, human, rights, watch, asserted, that, it, was, reminiscent, of, nazi, posters, during, the, second, world, war, featuring, the, laughing, jew, orb, n, and, his, government, s, representative, said, they, had, a, zero, tolerance, of, antisemitism, explaining, the, posters, were, aiming, to, persuade, voters, that, soros, was, a, national, security, risk, hours, later, in, an, apparent, attempt, to, ally, israel, with, hungary, israel, s, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, issued, a, clarification, denouncing, soros, stating, that, he, continuously, undermines, israel, s, democratically, elected, governments, by, funding, organizations, that, defame, the, jewish, state, and, seek, to, deny, it, the, right, to, defend, itself, soros, s, son, alexander, said, in, an, interview, that, his, father, cares, about, israel, and, that, he, would, like, to, see, israel, in, yitzhak, rabin, s, image, his, views, are, more, or, less, the, common, views, in, meretz, and, in, the, labor, party, according, to, alexander, soros, supports, a, two, state, solution, the, younger, soros, recounts, that, after, his, bar, mitzvah, in, 1998, his, father, told, him, if, you, re, serious, about, being, jewish, you, might, want, to, consider, immigrating, to, israel, in, a, 2018, interview, with, the, new, york, times, alex, soros, the, son, of, george, soros, when, asked, why, his, father, fights, for, an, open, society, soros, replied, that, in, a, non, jewish, state, a, jew, can, only, feel, safe, when, other, minorities, are, protected, which, is, one, of, the, most, important, driving, forces, why, his, father, has, been, active, in, his, philanthropy, but, he, had, always, identified, firstly, as, a, jew, and, his, philanthropy, was, ultimately, an, expression, of, his, jewish, identity, in, that, he, felt, a, solidarity, with, other, minority, groups, and, also, because, he, recognized, that, a, jew, could, only, truly, be, safe, in, a, world, in, which, all, minorities, were, protected, explaining, his, father, s, motives, he, said, the, reason, you, fight, for, an, open, society, is, because, that, s, the, only, society, that, you, can, live, in, as, a, jew, unless, you, become, a, nationalist, and, only, fight, for, your, own, rights, in, your, own, state, in, december, 2023, israel, s, ambassador, to, the, united, nations, gilad, erdan, accused, soros, of, supporting, pro, palestinian, organizations, that, seek, the, destruction, of, the, state, of, israel, as, a, jewish, state, soros, son, alexander, dismissed, accusations, of, anti, semitism, as, distorted, and, dishonest, right, wing, attacks, on, november, 11, 2003, in, an, interview, with, the, washington, post, soros, said, that, removing, president, george, w, bush, from, office, was, the, central, focus, of, my, life, and, a, matter, of, life, and, death, he, said, he, would, sacrifice, his, entire, fortune, to, defeat, bush, if, someone, guaranteed, it, soros, gave, 3, million, to, the, center, for, american, progress, 2, 5, million, to, moveon, org, and, 20, million, to, america, coming, together, these, groups, worked, to, support, democrats, in, the, 2004, election, on, september, 28, 2004, he, dedicated, more, money, to, the, campaign, and, kicked, off, his, own, multistate, tour, with, a, speech, why, we, must, not, re, elect, president, bush, delivered, at, the, national, press, club, in, washington, d, c, the, online, transcript, of, this, speech, received, many, views, after, dick, cheney, accidentally, referred, to, factcheck, org, as, factcheck, com, in, the, vice, presidential, debate, causing, the, owner, of, that, domain, to, redirect, all, traffic, to, soros, s, site, his, 2003, book, the, bubble, of, american, supremacy, was, a, forthright, critique, of, the, bush, administration, s, war, on, terror, as, misconceived, and, counterproductive, and, a, polemic, against, the, re, election, of, bush, he, explains, the, title, in, the,
