proust, and, henry, james, among, others, but, he, offsets, these, high, culture, references, with, jokes, bellow, interspersed, autobiographical, elements, into, his, fiction, and, many, of, his, principal, characters, were, said, to, bear, a, resemblance, to, him, martin, amis, described, bellow, as, the, greatest, american, author, ever, in, my, view, his, sentences, seem, to, weigh, more, than, anyone, else, s, he, is, like, a, force, of, nature, he, breaks, all, the, rules, he, people, in, bellow, s, fiction, are, real, people, yet, the, intensity, of, the, gaze, that, he, bathes, them, in, somehow, through, the, particular, opens, up, into, the, universal, for, linda, grant, what, bellow, had, to, tell, us, in, his, fiction, was, that, it, was, worth, it, being, alive, his, vigour, vitality, humour, and, passion, were, always, matched, by, the, insistence, on, thought, not, the, predigested, cliches, of, the, mass, media, or, of, those, on, the, left, which, had, begun, to, disgust, him, by, the, sixties, it, s, easy, to, be, a, writer, of, conscience, anyone, can, do, it, if, they, want, to, just, choose, your, cause, bellow, was, a, writer, about, conscience, and, consciousness, forever, conflicted, by, the, competing, demands, of, the, great, cities, the, individual, s, urge, to, survival, against, all, odds, and, his, equal, need, for, love, and, some, kind, of, penetrating, understanding, of, what, there, was, of, significance, beyond, all, the, racket, and, racketeering, on, the, other, hand, bellow, s, detractors, considered, his, work, conventional, and, old, fashioned, as, if, the, author, were, trying, to, revive, the, 19th, century, european, novel, in, a, private, letter, vladimir, nabokov, described, bellow, as, a, miserable, mediocrity, journalist, and, author, ron, rosenbaum, described, bellow, s, ravelstein, 2000, as, the, only, book, that, rose, above, bellow, s, failings, as, an, author, rosenbaum, wrote, my, problem, with, the, pre, ravelstein, bellow, is, that, he, all, too, often, strains, too, hard, to, yoke, together, two, somewhat, contradictory, aspects, of, his, being, and, style, there, s, the, street, wise, windy, city, wiseguy, and, then, as, if, to, show, off, that, the, wiseguy, has, wisdom, there, are, the, undigested, chunks, of, arcane, not, entirely, impressive, philosophic, thought, and, speculation, just, to, make, sure, you, know, his, novels, have, intellectual, heft, that, the, world, and, the, flesh, in, his, prose, are, both, figured, and, transfigured, kingsley, amis, father, of, martin, amis, was, less, impressed, by, bellow, in, 1971, kingsley, suggested, that, crime, writer, john, d, macdonald, is, by, any, standards, a, better, writer, than, saul, bellow, sam, tanenhaus, wrote, in, the, new, york, times, book, review, in, 2007, but, what, then, of, the, many, defects, the, longueurs, and, digressions, the, lectures, on, anthroposophy, and, religion, the, arcane, reading, lists, what, of, the, characters, who, don, t, change, or, grow, but, simply, bristle, onto, the, page, even, the, colorful, lowlifes, pontificating, like, fevered, students, in, the, seminars, bellow, taught, at, the, university, of, chicago, and, what, of, the, punitively, caricatured, ex, wives, drawn, from, the, teeming, annals, of, the, novelist, s, own, marital, discord, but, tanenhaus, went, on, to, answer, his, question, shortcomings, to, be, sure, but, so, what, nature, doesn, t, owe, us, perfection, novelists, don, t, either, who, among, us, would, even, recognize, perfection, if, we, saw, it, in, any, event, applying, critical, methods, of, whatever, sort, seemed, futile, in, the, case, of, an, author, who, as, randall, jarrell, once, wrote, of, walt, whitman, is, a, world, a, waste, with, here, and, there, systems, blazing, at, random, out, of, the, darkness, those, systems, as, beautifully, and, astonishingly, organized, as, the, rings, and, satellites,

tolstoy, of, the, zulus, the, proust, of, the, papuans, i, d, be, glad, to, read, him, bellow, distanced, himself, somewhat, from, these, remarks, which, he, characterized, as, off, the, cuff, obviously, and, pedantic, certainly, he, however, stood, by, his, criticism, of, multiculturalism, writing, in, any, reasonably, open, society, the, absurdity, of, a, petty, thought, police, campaign, provoked, by, the, inane, magnification, of, discriminatory, remarks, about, the, papuans, and, the, zulus, would, be, laughed, at, to, be, serious, in, this, fanatical, style, is, a, sort, of, stalinism, the, stalinist, seriousness, and, fidelity, to, the, party, line, that, senior, citizens, like, me, remember, all, too, well, despite, his, identification, with, chicago, he, kept, aloof, from, some, of, that, city, s, more, conventional, writers, in, a, 2006, interview, with, stop, smiling, magazine, studs, terkel, said, of, bellow, i, didn, t, know, him, too, well, we, disagreed, on,
