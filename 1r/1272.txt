rather, than, confront, her, husband, over, his, inappropriate, activities, joined, in, twice, she, accompanied, him, in, tickling, elizabeth, and, once, held, her, while, he, cut, her, black, gown, into, a, thousand, pieces, however, after, parr, discovered, the, pair, in, an, embrace, she, ended, this, state, of, affairs, in, may, 1548, elizabeth, was, sent, away, thomas, seymour, nevertheless, continued, scheming, to, control, the, royal, family, and, tried, to, have, himself, appointed, the, governor, of, the, king, s, person, when, parr, died, after, childbirth, on, 5, september, 1548, he, renewed, his, attentions, towards, elizabeth, intent, on, marrying, her, her, governess, kat, ashley, who, was, fond, of, seymour, sought, to, convince, elizabeth, to, take, him, as, her, husband, she, tried, to, convince, elizabeth, to, write, to, seymour, and, comfort, him, in, his, sorrow, but, elizabeth, claimed, that, thomas, was, not, so, saddened, by, her, stepmother, s, death, as, to, need, comfort, in, january, 1549, seymour, was, arrested, and, imprisoned, in, the, tower, on, suspicion, of, conspiring, to, depose, his, brother, somerset, as, protector, marry, lady, jane, grey, to, king, edward, vi, and, take, elizabeth, as, his, own, wife, elizabeth, living, at, hatfield, house, would, admit, nothing, her, stubbornness, exasperated, her, interrogator, robert, tyrwhitt, who,

the, crown, act, 1543, excluded, both, mary, and, elizabeth, from, the, succession, and, instead, declared, as, his, heir, lady, jane, grey, granddaughter, of, henry, viii, s, younger, sister, mary, tudor, queen, of, france, jane, was, proclaimed, queen, by, the, privy, council, but, her, support, quickly, crumbled, and, she, was, deposed, after, nine, days, on, 3, august, 1553, mary, rode, triumphantly, into, london, with, elizabeth, at, her, side, the, show, of, solidarity, between, the, sisters, did, not, last, long, mary, a, devout, catholic, was, determined, to, crush, the, protestant, faith, in, which, elizabeth, had, been, educated, and, she, ordered, that, everyone, attend, catholic, mass, elizabeth, had, to, outwardly, conform, mary, s, initial, popularity, ebbed, away, in, 1554, when, she, announced, plans, to, marry, philip, of, spain, the, son, of, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, and, an, active, catholic, discontent, spread, rapidly, through, the, country, and, many, looked, to, elizabeth, as, a, focus, for, their, opposition, to, mary, s, religious, policies, in, january, and, february, 1554, wyatt, s, rebellion, broke, out, it, was, soon, suppressed, elizabeth, was, brought, to, court, and, interrogated, regarding, her, role, and, on, 18, march, she, was, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, london, elizabeth, fervently, protested, her, innocence, though, it, is, unlikely, that, she, had, plotted, with, the, rebels, some, of, them, were, known, to, have, approached, her, mary, s, closest, confidant, emperor, charles, s, ambassador, simon, renard, argued, that, her, throne, would, never, be, safe, while, elizabeth, lived, and, lord, chancellor, stephen, gardiner, worked, to, have, elizabeth, put, on, trial, elizabeth, s, supporters, in, the, government, including, william, paget, baron, paget, convinced, mary, to, spare, her, sister, in, the, absence, of, hard, evidence, against, her, instead, on, 22, may, elizabeth, was, moved, from, the, tower, to, woodstock, where, she, was, to, spend, almost, a, year, under, house, arrest, in, the, charge, of, henry, bedingfeld, crowds, cheered, her, all, along, the, way, on, 17, april, 1555, elizabeth, was, recalled, to, court, to, attend, the, final, stages, of, mary, s, apparent, pregnancy, if, mary, and, her, child, died, elizabeth, would, become, queen, but, if, mary, gave, birth, to, a, healthy, child, elizabeth, s, chances, of, becoming, queen, would, recede, sharply, when, it, became, clear, that, mary, was, not, pregnant, no, one, believed, any, longer, that, she, could, have, a, child, elizabeth, s, succession, seemed, assured, king, philip, who, ascended, the, spanish, throne, in, 1556, acknowledged, the, new, political, reality, and, cultivated, his, sister, in, law, she, was, a, better, ally, than, the, chief, alternative, mary, queen, of, scots, who, had, grown, up, in, france, and, was, betrothed, to, the, dauphin, of, france, when, his, wife, fell, ill, in, 1558, philip, sent, the, count, of, feria, to, consult, with, elizabeth, this, interview, was, conducted, at, hatfield, house, where, she, had, returned, to, live, in, october, 1555, by, october, 1558, elizabeth, was, already, making, plans, for, her, government, mary, recognised, elizabeth, as, her, heir, on, 6, november, 1558, and, elizabeth, became, queen, when, mary, died, on, 17, november, elizabeth, became, queen, at, the, age, of, 25, and, declared, her, intentions, to, her, council, and, other, peers, who, had, come, to, hatfield, to, swear, allegiance, the, speech, contains, the, first, record, of, her, adoption, of, the, medieval, political, theology, of, the, sovereign, s, two, bodies, the, body, natural, and, the, body, politic, my, lords, the, law, of, nature, moves, me, to, sorrow, for, my, sister, the, burden, that, is, fallen, upon, me, makes, me, amazed, and, yet, considering, i, am, god, s, creature, ordained, to, obey, his, appointment, i, will, thereto, yield, desiring, from, the, bottom, of, my, heart, that, i, may, have, assistance, of, his, grace, to, be, the, minister, of, his, heavenly, will, in, this, office, now, committed, to, me, and, as, i, am, but, one, body, naturally, considered, though, by, his, permission, a, body, politic, to, govern, so, shall, i, desire, you, all, to, be, assistant, to, me, that, i, with, my, ruling, and, you, with, your, service, may, make, a, good, account, to, almighty, god, and, leave, some, comfort, to, our, posterity, on, earth, i, mean, to, direct, all, my, actions, by, good, advice, and, counsel, as, her, triumphal, progress, wound, through, the, city, on, the, eve, of, the, coronation, ceremony, she, was, welcomed, wholeheartedly, by, the, citizens, and, greeted, by, orations, and, pageants, most, with, a, strong, protestant, flavour, elizabeth, s, open, and, gracious, responses, endeared, her, to, the, spectators, who, were, wonderfully, ravished, the, following, day, 15, january, 1559, a, date, chosen, by, her, astrologer, john, dee, elizabeth, was, crowned, and, anointed, by, owen, oglethorpe, the, catholic, bishop, of, carlisle, in, westminster, abbey, she, was, then, presented, for, the, people, s, acceptance, amidst, a, deafening, noise, of, organs, fifes, trumpets, drums, and, bells, although, elizabeth, was, welcomed, as, queen, in, england, the, country, was, still, in, a, state, of, anxiety, over, the, perceived, catholic, threat, at, home, and, overseas, as, well, as, the, choice, of, whom, she, would, marry, elizabeth, s, personal, religious, convictions, have, been, much, debated, by, scholars, she, was, a, protestant, but, kept, catholic, symbols, such, as, the, crucifix, and, downplayed, the, role, of, sermons, in, defiance, of, a, key, protestant, belief, elizabeth, and, her, advisers, perceived, the, threat, of, a, catholic, crusade, against, heretical, england, the, queen, therefore, sought, a, protestant, solution, that, would, not, offend, catholics, too, greatly, while, addressing, the, desires, of, english, protestants, but, she, would, not, tolerate, the, puritans, who, were, pushing, for, far, reaching, reforms, as, a, result, the, parliament, of, 1559, started, to, legislate, for, a, church, based, on, the, protestant, settlement, of, edward, vi, with, the, monarch, as, its, head, but, with, many, catholic, elements, such, as, vestments, the, house, of, commons, backed, the, proposals, strongly, but, the, bill, of, supremacy, met, opposition, in, the, house, of, lords, particularly, from, the, bishops, elizabeth, was, fortunate, that, many, bishoprics, were, vacant, at, the, time, including, the, archbishopric, of, canterbury, this, enabled, supporters, amongst, peers, to, outvote, the, bishops, and, conservative, peers, nevertheless, elizabeth, was, forced, to, accept, the, title, of, supreme, governor, of, the, church, of, england, rather, than, the, more, contentious, title, of, supreme, head, which, many, thought, unacceptable, for, a, woman, to, bear, the, new, act, of, supremacy, became, law, on, 8, may, 1559, all, public, officials, were, forced, to, swear, an, oath, of, loyalty, to, the, monarch, as, the, supreme, governor, or, risk, disqualification, from, office, the, heresy, laws, were, repealed, to, avoid, a, repeat, of, the, persecution, of, dissenters, by, mary, at, the, same, time, a, new, act, of, uniformity, was, passed, which, made, attendance, at, church, and, the, use, of, the, 1559, book, of, common, prayer, an, adapted, version, of, the, 1552, prayer, book, compulsory, though, the, penalties, for, recusancy, or, failure, to, attend, and, conform, were, not, extreme, from, the, start, of, elizabeth, s, reign, it, was, expected, that, she, would, marry, and, the, question, arose, to, whom, although, she, received, many, offers, she, never, married, and, remained, childless, the, reasons, for, this, are, not, clear, historians, have, speculated, that, thomas, seymour, had, put, her, off, sexual, relationships, she, considered, several, suitors, until, she, was, about, fifty, her, last, courtship, was, with, francis, duke, of, anjou, 22, years, her, junior, while, risking, possible, loss, of, power, like, her, sister, who, played, into, the, hands, of, king, philip, ii, of, spain, marriage, offered, the, chance, of, an, heir, however, the, choice, of, a, husband, might, also, provoke, political, instability, or, even, insurrection, in, the, spring, of, 1559, it, became, evident, that, elizabeth, was, in, love, with, her, childhood, friend, robert, dudley, it, was, said, that, his, wife, amy, was, suffering, from, a, malady, in, one, of, her, breasts, and, that, the, queen, would, like, to, marry, robert, if, his, wife, should, die, by, the, autumn, of, 1559, several, foreign, suitors, were, vying, for, elizabeth, s, hand, their, impatient, envoys, engaged, in, ever, more, scandalous, talk, and, reported, that, a, marriage, with, her, favourite, was, not, welcome, in, england, there, is, not, a, man, who, does, not, cry, out, on, him, and, her, with, indignation, she, will, marry, none, but, the, favoured, robert, amy, dudley, died, in, september, 1560, from, a, fall, from, a, flight, of, stairs, and, despite, the, coroner, s, inquest, finding, of, accident, many, people, suspected, her, husband, of, having, arranged, her, death, so, that, he, could, marry, the, queen, elizabeth, seriously, considered, marrying, dudley, for, some, time, however, william, cecil, nicholas, throckmorton, and, some, conservative, peers, made, their, disapproval, unmistakably, clear, there, were, even, rumours, that, the, nobility, would, rise, if, the, marriage, took, place, among, other, marriage, candidates, being, considered, for, the, queen, robert, dudley, continued, to, be, regarded, as, a, possible, candidate, for, nearly, another, decade, elizabeth, was, extremely, jealous, of, his, affections, even, when, she, no, longer, meant, to, marry, him, herself, she, raised, dudley, to, the, peerage, as, earl, of, leicester, in, 1564, in, 1578, he, finally, married, lettice, knollys, to, whom, the, queen, reacted, with, repeated, scenes, of, displeasure, and, lifelong, hatred, still, dudley, always, remained, at, the, centre, of, emotional, life, as, historian, susan, doran, has, described, the, situation, he, died, shortly, after, the, defeat, of, the, spanish, armada, in, 1588, after, elizabeth, s, own, death, a, note, from, him, was, found, among, her, most, personal, belongings, marked, his, last, letter, in, her, handwriting, marriage, negotiations, constituted, a, key, element, in, elizabeth, s, foreign, policy, she, turned, down, the, hand, of, philip, her, half, sister, s, widower, early, in, 1559, but, for, several, years, entertained, the, proposal, of, king, eric, xiv, of, sweden, earlier, in, elizabeth, s, life, a, danish, match, for, her, had, been, discussed, henry, viii, had, proposed, one, with, the, danish, prince, adolf, duke, of, holstein, gottorp, in, 1545, and, edward, seymour, duke, of, somerset, suggested, a, marriage, with, prince, frederick, later, frederick, ii, several, years, later, but, the, negotiations, had, abated, in, 1551, in, the, years, around, 1559, a, dano, english, protestant, alliance, was, considered, and, to, counter, sweden, s, proposal, king, frederick, ii, proposed, to, elizabeth, in, late, 1559, for, several, years, she, seriously, negotiated, to, marry, philip, s, cousin, charles, ii, archduke, of, austria, by, 1569, relations, with, the, habsburgs, had, deteriorated, elizabeth, considered, marriage, to, two, french, valois, princes, in, turn, first, henry, duke, of, anjou, and, then, from, 1572, to, 1581, his, brother, francis, duke, of, anjou, formerly, duke, of, alen, on, this, last, proposal, was, tied, to, a, planned, alliance, against, spanish, control, of, the, southern, netherlands, elizabeth, seems, to, have, taken, the, courtship, seriously, for, a, time, wearing, a, frog, shaped, earring, that, francis, had, sent, her, in, 1563, elizabeth, told, an, imperial, envoy, if, i, follow, the, inclination, of, my, nature, it, is, this, beggar, woman, and, single, far, rather, than, queen, and, married, later, in, the, year, following, elizabeth, s, illness, with, smallpox, the, succession, question, became, a, heated, issue, in, parliament, members, urged, the, queen, to, marry, or, nominate, an, heir, to, prevent, a, civil, war, upon, her, death, she, refused, to, do, either, in, april, she, prorogued, the, parliament, which, did, not, reconvene, until, she, needed, its, support, to, raise, taxes, in, 1566, having, previously, promised, to, marry, she, told, an, unruly, house, i, will, never, break, the, word, of, a, prince, spoken, in, public, place, for, my, honour, s, sake, and, therefore, i, say, again, i, will, marry, as, soon, as, i, can, conveniently, if, god, take, not, him, away, with, whom, i, mind, to, marry, or, myself, or, else, some, other, great, let, happen, by, 1570, senior, figures, in, the, government, privately, accepted, that, elizabeth, would, never, marry, or, name, a, successor, william, cecil, was, already, seeking, solutions, to, the, succession, problem, for, her, failure, to, marry, elizabeth, was, often, accused, of, irresponsibility, her, silence, however, strengthened, her, own, political, security, she, knew, that, if, she, named, an, heir, her, throne, would, be, vulnerable, to, a, coup, she, remembered, the, way, that, a, second, person, as, i, have, been, had, been, used, as, the, focus, of, plots, against, her, predecessor, elizabeth, s, unmarried, status, inspired, a, cult, of, virginity, related, to, that, of, the, virgin, mary, in, poetry, and, portraiture, she, was, depicted, as, a, virgin, a, goddess, or, both, not, as, a, normal, woman, at, first, only, elizabeth, made, a, virtue, of, her, ostensible, virginity, in, 1559, she, told, the, commons, and, in, the, end, this, shall, be, for, me, sufficient, that, a, marble, stone, shall, declare, that, a, queen, having, reigned, such, a, time, lived, and, died, a, virgin, later, on, poets, and, writers, took, up, the, theme, and, developed, an, iconography, that, exalted, elizabeth, public, tributes, to, the, virgin, by, 1578, acted, as, a, coded, assertion, of, opposition, to, the, queen, s, marriage, negotiations, with, the, duke, of, alen, on, ultimately, elizabeth, would, insist, she, was, married, to, her, kingdom, and, subjects, under, divine, protection, in, 1599, she, spoke, of, all, my, husbands, my, good, people, this, claim, of, virginity, was, not, universally, accepted, catholics, accused, elizabeth, of, engaging, in, filthy, lust, that, symbolically, defiled, the, nation, along, with, her, body, henry, iv, of, france, said, that, one, of, the, great, questions, of, europe, was, whether, queen, elizabeth, was, a, maid, or, no, a, central, issue, when, it, comes, to, the, question, of, elizabeth, s, virginity, was, whether, the, queen, ever, consummated, her, love, affair, with, robert, dudley, in, 1559, she, had, dudley, s, bedchambers, moved, next, to, her, own, apartments, in, 1561, she, was, mysteriously, bedridden, with, an, illness, that, caused, her, body, to, swell, in, 1587, a, young, man, calling, himself, arthur, dudley, was, arrested, on, the, coast, of, spain, under, suspicion, of, being, a, spy, the, man, claimed, to, be, the, illegitimate, son, of, elizabeth, and, robert, dudley, with, his, age, being, consistent, with, birth, during, the, 1561, illness, he, was, taken, to, madrid, for, investigation, where, he, was, examined, by, francis, englefield, a, catholic, aristocrat, exiled, to, spain, and, secretary, to, king, philip, ii, three, letters, exist, today, describing, the, interview, detailing, what, arthur, proclaimed, to, be, the, story, of, his, life, from, birth, in, the, royal, palace, to, the, time, of, his, arrival, in, spain, however, this, failed, to, convince, the, spaniards, englefield, admitted, to, king, philip, that, arthur, s, claim, at, present, amounts, to, nothing, but, suggested, that, he, should, not, be, allowed, to, get, away, but, kept, very, secure, the, king, agreed, and, arthur, was, never, heard, from, again, modern, scholarship, dismisses, the, story, s, basic, premise, as, impossible, and, asserts, that, elizabeth, s, life, was, so, closely, observed, by, contemporaries, that, she, could, not, have, hidden, a, pregnancy, elizabeth, s, first, policy, toward, scotland, was, to, oppose, the, french, presence, there, she, feared, that, the, french, planned, to, invade, england, and, put, her, catholic, cousin, mary, queen, of, scots, on, the, throne, mary, was, considered, by, many, to, be, the, heir, to, the, english, crown, being, the, granddaughter, of, henry, viii, s, elder, sister, margaret, mary, boasted, being, the, nearest, kinswoman, she, hath, elizabeth, was, persuaded, to, send, a, force, into, scotland, to, aid, the, protestant, rebels, and, though, the, campaign, was, inept, the, resulting, treaty, of, edinburgh, of, july, 1560, removed, the, french, threat, in, the, north, when, mary, returned, from, france, to, scotland, in, 1561, to, take, up, the, reins, of, power, the, country, had, an, established, protestant, church, and, was, run, by, a, council, of, protestant, nobles, supported, by, elizabeth, mary, refused, to, ratify, the, treaty, in, 1563, elizabeth, proposed, her, own, suitor, robert, dudley, as, a, husband, for, mary, without, asking, either, of, the, two, people, concerned, both, proved, unenthusiastic, and, in, 1565, mary, married, henry, stuart, lord, darnley, who, carried, his, own, claim, to, the, english, throne, the, marriage, was, the, first, of, a, series, of, errors, of, judgement, by, mary, that, handed, the, victory, to, the, scottish, protestants, and, to, elizabeth, darnley, quickly, became, unpopular, and, was, murdered, in, february, 1567, by, conspirators, almost, certainly, led, by, james, hepburn, earl, of, bothwell, shortly, afterwards, on, 15, may, 1567, mary, married, bothwell, arousing, suspicions, that, she, had, been, party, to, the, murder, of, her, husband, elizabeth, confronted, mary, about, the, marriage, writing, to, her, how, could, a, worse, choice, be, made, for, your, honour, than, in, such, haste, to, marry, such, a, subject, who, besides, other, and, notorious, lacks, public, fame, has, charged, with, the, murder, of, your, late, husband, besides, the, touching, of, yourself, also, in, some, part, though, we, trust, in, that, behalf, falsely, these, events, led, rapidly, to, mary, s, defeat, and, imprisonment, in, lochleven, castle, the, scottish, lords, forced, her, to, abdicate, in, favour, of, her, one, year, old, son, james, vi, james, was, taken, to, stirling, castle, to, be, raised, as, a, protestant, mary, escaped, in, 1568, but, after, a, defeat, at, langside, sailed, to, england, where, she, had, once, been, assured, of, support, from, elizabeth, elizabeth, s, first, instinct, was, to, restore, her, fellow, monarch, but, she, and, her, council, instead, chose, to, play, safe, rather, than, risk, returning, mary, to, scotland, with, an, english, army, or, sending, her, to, france, and, the, catholic, enemies, of, england, they, detained, her, in, england, where, she, was, imprisoned, for, the, next, nineteen, years, mary, was, soon, the, focus, for, rebellion, in, 1569, there, was, a, major, catholic, rising, in, the, north, the, goal, was, to, free, mary, marry, her, to, thomas, howard, duke, of, norfolk, and, put, her, on, the, english, throne, after, the, rebels, defeat, over, 750, of, them, were, executed, on, elizabeth, s, orders, in, the, belief, that, the, revolt, had, been, successful, pope, pius, v, issued, a, bull, in, 1570, titled, regnans, in, excelsis, which, declared, elizabeth, the, pretended, queen, of, england, and, the, servant, of, crime, to, be, excommunicated, and, a, heretic, releasing, all, her, subjects, from, any, allegiance, to, her, catholics, who, obeyed, her, orders, were, threatened, with, excommunication, the, papal, bull, provoked, legislative, initiatives, against, catholics, by, parliament, which, were, however, mitigated, by, elizabeth, s, intervention, in, 1581, to, convert, english, subjects, to, catholicism, with, the, intent, to, withdraw, them, from, their, allegiance, to, elizabeth, was, made, a, treasonable, offence, carrying, the, death, penalty, from, the, 1570s, missionary, priests, from, continental, seminaries, went, to, england, secretly, in, the, cause, of, the, reconversion, of, england, some, were, executed, for, treasonable, conduct, engendering, a, cult, of, martyrdom, regnans, in, excelsis, gave, english, catholics, a, strong, incentive, to, look, to, mary, as, the, legitimate, sovereign, of, england, mary, may, not, have, been, told, of, every, catholic, plot, to, put, her, on, the, english, throne, but, from, the, ridolfi, plot, of, 1571, which, caused, mary, s, suitor, the, duke, of, norfolk, to, lose, his, head, to, the, babington, plot, of, 1586, elizabeth, s, spymaster, francis, walsingham, and, the, royal, council, keenly, assembled, a, case, against, her, at, first, elizabeth, resisted, calls, for, mary, s, death, by, late, 1586, she, had, been, persuaded, to, sanction, mary, s, trial, and, execution, on, the, evidence, of, letters, written, during, the, babington, plot, elizabeth, s, proclamation, of, the, sentence, announced, that, the, said, mary, pretending, title, to, the, same, crown, had, compassed, and, imagined, within, the, same, realm, diverse, things, tending, to, the, hurt, death, and, destruction, of, our, royal, person, on, 8, february, 1587, mary, was, beheaded, at, fotheringhay, castle, northamptonshire, after, the, execution, elizabeth, claimed, that, she, had, not, intended, for, the, signed, execution, warrant, to, be, dispatched, and, blamed, her, secretary, william, davison, for, implementing, it, without, her, knowledge, the, sincerity, of, elizabeth, s, remorse, and, whether, or, not, she, wanted, to, delay, the, warrant, have, been, called, into, question, both, by, her, contemporaries, and, later, historians, elizabeth, s, foreign, policy, was, largely, defensive, the, exception, was, the, english, occupation, of, le, havre, from, october, 1562, to, june, 1563, which, ended, in, failure, when, elizabeth, s, huguenot, allies, joined, with, the, catholics, to, retake, the, port, elizabeth, s, intention, had, been, to, exchange, le, havre, for, calais, lost, to, france, in, january, 1558, only, through, the, activities, of, her, fleets, did, elizabeth, pursue, an, aggressive, policy, this, paid, off, in, the, war, against, spain, 80, of, which, was, fought, at, sea, she, knighted, francis, drake, after, his, circumnavigation, of, the, globe, from, 1577, to, 1580, and, he, won, fame, for, his, raids, on, spanish, ports, and, fleets, an, element, of, piracy, and, self, enrichment, drove, elizabethan, seafarers, over, whom, the, queen, had, little, control, after, the, occupation, and, loss, of, le, havre, in, 1562, 1563, elizabeth, avoided, military, expeditions, on, the, continent, until, 1585, when, she, sent, an, english, army, to, aid, the, protestant, dutch, rebels, against, philip, ii, this, followed, the, deaths, in, 1584, of, the, queen, s, allies, william, the, silent, prince, of, orange, and, the, duke, of, anjou, and, the, surrender, of, a, series, of, dutch, towns, to, alexander, farnese, duke, of, parma, philip, s, governor, of, the, spanish, netherlands, in, december, 1584, an, alliance, between, philip, ii, and, the, french, catholic, league, at, joinville, undermined, the, ability, of, anjou, s, brother, henry, iii, of, france, to, counter, spanish, domination, of, the, netherlands, it, also, extended, spanish, influence, along, the, channel, coast, of, france, where, the, catholic, league, was, strong, and, exposed, england, to, invasion, the, siege, of, antwerp, in, the, summer, of, 1585, by, the, duke, of, parma, necessitated, some, reaction, on, the, part, of, the, english, and, the, dutch, the, outcome, was, the, treaty, of, nonsuch, of, august, 1585, in, which, elizabeth, promised, military, support, to, the, dutch, the, treaty, marked, the, beginning, of, the, anglo, spanish, war, which, lasted, until, the, treaty, of, london, in, 1604, the, expedition, was, led, by, elizabeth, s, former, suitor, the, earl, of, leicester, elizabeth, from, the, start, did, not, really, back, this, course, of, action, her, strategy, to, support, the, dutch, on, the, surface, with, an, english, army, while, beginning, secret, peace, talks, with, spain, within, days, of, leicester, s, arrival, in, holland, had, necessarily, to, be, at, odds, with, leicester, s, who, had, set, up, a, protectorate, and, was, expected, by, the, dutch, to, fight, an, active, campaign, elizabeth, on, the, other, hand, wanted, him, to, avoid, at, all, costs, any, decisive, action, with, the, enemy, he, enraged, elizabeth, by, accepting, the, post, of, governor, general, from, the, dutch, states, general, elizabeth, saw, this, as, a, dutch, ploy, to, force, her, to, accept, sovereignty, over, the, netherlands, which, so, far, she, had, always, declined, she, wrote, to, leicester, we, could, never, have, imagined, had, we, not, seen, it, fall, out, in, experience, that, a, man, raised, up, by, ourself, and, extraordinarily, favoured, by, us, above, any, other, subject, of, this, land, would, have, in, so, contemptible, a, sort, broken, our, commandment, in, a, cause, that, so, greatly, touches, us, in, honour, and, therefore, our, express, pleasure, and, commandment, is, that, all, delays, and, excuses, laid, apart, you, do, presently, upon, the, duty, of, your, allegiance, obey, and, fulfill, whatsoever, the, bearer, hereof, shall, direct, you, to, do, in, our, name, whereof, fail, you, not, as, you, will, answer, the, contrary, at, your, utmost, peril, elizabeth, s, commandment, was, that, her, emissary, read, out, her, letters, of, disapproval, publicly, before, the, dutch, council, of, state, leicester, having, to, stand, nearby, this, public, humiliation, of, her, lieutenant, general, combined, with, her, continued, talks, for, a, separate, peace, with, spain, irreversibly, undermined, leicester, s, standing, among, the, dutch, the, military, campaign, was, severely, hampered, by, elizabeth, s, repeated, refusals, to, send, promised, funds, for, her, starving, soldiers, her, unwillingness, to, commit, herself, to, the, cause, leicester, s, own, shortcomings, as, a, political, and, military, leader, and, the, faction, ridden, and, chaotic, situation, of, dutch, politics, led, to, the, failure, of, the, campaign, leicester, finally, resigned, his, command, in, december, 1587, meanwhile, francis, drake, had, undertaken, a, major, voyage, against, spanish, ports, and, ships, in, the, caribbean, in, 1585, and, 1586, in, 1587, he, made, a, successful, raid, on, c, diz, destroying, the, spanish, fleet, of, war, ships, intended, for, the, enterprise, of, england, as, philip, ii, had, decided, to, take, the, war, to, england, on, 12, july, 1588, the, spanish, armada, a, great, fleet, of, ships, set, sail, for, the, channel, planning, to, ferry, a, spanish, invasion, force, under, the, duke, of, parma, to, the, coast, of, southeast, england, from, the, netherlands, the, armada, was, defeated, by, a, combination, of, miscalculation, misfortune, and, an, attack, of, english, fire, ships, off, gravelines, at, midnight, on, 28, 29, july, 7, 8, august, new, style, which, dispersed, the, spanish, ships, to, the, northeast, the, armada, straggled, home, to, spain, in, shattered, remnants, after, disastrous, losses, on, the, coast, of, ireland, after, some, ships, had, tried, to, struggle, back, to, spain, via, the, north, sea, and, then, back, south, past, the, west, coast, of, ireland, unaware, of, the, armada, s, fate, english, militias, mustered, to, defend, the, country, under, the, earl, of, leicester, s, command, leicester, invited, elizabeth, to, inspect, her, troops, at, tilbury, in, essex, on, 8, august, wearing, a, silver, breastplate, over, a, white, velvet, dress, she, addressed, them, in, her, speech, to, the, troops, at, tilbury, my, loving, people, we, have, been, persuaded, by, some, that, are, careful, of, our, safety, to, take, heed, how, we, commit, ourself, to, armed, multitudes, for, fear, of, treachery, but, i, assure, you, i, do, not, desire, to, live, to, distrust, my, faithful, and, loving, people, i, know, i, have, the, body, but, of, a, weak, and, feeble, woman, but, i, have, the, heart, and, stomach, of, a, king, and, of, a, king, of, england, too, and, think, foul, scorn, that, parma, or, spain, or, any, prince, of, europe, should, dare, to, invade, the, borders, of, my, realm, when, no, invasion, came, the, nation, rejoiced, elizabeth, s, procession, to, a, thanksgiving, service, at, st, paul, s, cathedral, rivalled, that, of, her, coronation, as, a, spectacle, the, defeat, of, the, armada, was, a, potent, propaganda, victory, both, for, elizabeth, and, for, protestant, england, the, english, took, their, delivery, as, a, symbol, of, god, s, favour, and, of, the, nation, s, inviolability, under, a, virgin, queen, however, the, victory, was, not, a, turning, point, in, the, war, which, continued, and, often, favoured, spain, the, spaniards, still, controlled, the, southern, provinces, of, the, netherlands, and, the, threat, of, invasion, remained, walter, raleigh, claimed, after, her, death, that, elizabeth, s, caution, had, impeded, the, war, against, spain, if, the, late, queen, would, have, believed, her, men, of, war, as, she, did, her, scribes, we, had, in, her, time, beaten, that, great, empire, in, pieces, and, made, their, kings, of, figs, and, oranges, as, in, old, times, but, her, majesty, did, all, by, halves, and, by, petty, invasions, taught, the, spaniard, how, to, defend, himself, and, to, see, his, own, weakness, though, some, historians, have, criticised, elizabeth, on, similar, grounds, elizabeth, had, good, reason, not, to, place, too, much, trust, in, her, commanders, who, once, in, action, tended, as, she, put, it, herself, to, be, transported, with, an, haviour, of, vainglory, in, 1589, the, year, after, the, spanish, armada, elizabeth, sent, to, spain, the, english, armada, or, counter, armada, with, 23, 375, men, and, 150, ships, led, by, francis, drake, as, admiral, and, john, norreys, as, general, the, english, fleet, suffered, a, catastrophic, defeat, with, 11, 000, 15, 000, killed, wounded, or, died, of, disease, and, 40, ships, sunk, or, captured, the, advantage, england, had, won, upon, the, destruction, of, the, spanish, armada, was, lost, and, the, spanish, victory, marked, a, revival, of, philip, ii, s, naval, power, through, the, next, decade, when, the, protestant, henry, iv, inherited, the, french, throne, in, 1589, elizabeth, sent, him, military, support, it, was, her, first, venture, into, france, since, the, retreat, from, le, havre, in, 1563, henry, s, succession, was, strongly, contested, by, the, catholic, league, and, by, philip, ii, and, elizabeth, feared, a, spanish, takeover, of, the, channel, ports, the, subsequent, english, campaigns, in, france, however, were, disorganised, and, ineffective, peregrine, bertie, largely, ignoring, elizabeth, s, orders, roamed, northern, france, to, little, effect, with, an, army, of, 4, 000, men, he, withdrew, in, disarray, in, december, 1589, having, lost, half, his, troops, in, 1591, the, campaign, of, john, norreys, who, led, 3, 000, men, to, brittany, was, even, more, of, a, disaster, as, for, all, such, expeditions, elizabeth, was, unwilling, to, invest, in, the, supplies, and, reinforcements, requested, by, the, commanders, norreys, left, for, london, to, plead, in, person, for, more, support, in, his, absence, a, catholic, league, army, almost, destroyed, the, remains, of, his, army, at, craon, north, west, france, in, may, 1591, in, july, elizabeth, sent, out, another, force, under, robert, devereux, earl, of, essex, to, help, henry, iv, in, besieging, rouen, the, result, was, just, as, dismal, essex, accomplished, nothing, and, returned, home, in, january, 1592, henry, abandoned, the, siege, in, april, as, usual, elizabeth, lacked, control, over, her, commanders, once, they, were, abroad, where, he, is, or, what, he, doth, or, what, he, is, to, do, she, wrote, of, essex, we, are, ignorant, although, ireland, was, one, of, her, two, kingdoms, elizabeth, faced, a, hostile, and, in, places, virtually, autonomous, irish, population, that, adhered, to, catholicism, and, was, willing, to, defy, her, authority, and, plot, with, her, enemies, her, policy, there, was, to, grant, land, to, her, courtiers, and, prevent, the, rebels, from, giving, spain, a, base, from, which, to, attack, england, in, the, course, of, a, series, of, uprisings, crown, forces, pursued, scorched, earth, tactics, burning, the, land, and, slaughtering, man, woman, and, child, during, a, revolt, in, munster, led, by, gerald, fitzgerald, in, 1582, an, estimated, 30, 000, irish, people, starved, to, death, the, poet, and, colonist, edmund, spenser, wrote, that, the, victims, were, brought, to, such, wretchedness, as, that, any, stony, heart, would, have, rued, the, same, elizabeth, advised, her, commanders, that, the, irish, that, rude, and, barbarous, nation, be, well, treated, but, she, or, her, commanders, showed, no, remorse, when, force, and, bloodshed, served, their, authoritarian, purpose, between, 1594, and, 1603, elizabeth, faced, her, most, severe, test, in, ireland, during, the, nine, years, war, a, revolt, that, took, place, at, the, height, of, hostilities, with, spain, who, backed, the, rebel, leader, hugh, o, neill, in, spring, 1599, elizabeth, sent, robert, devereux, to, put, the, revolt, down, to, her, frustration, he, made, little, progress, and, returned, to, england, in, defiance, of, her, orders, he, was, replaced, by, charles, blount, who, took, three, years, to, defeat, the, rebels, o, neill, finally, surrendered, in, 1603, a, few, days, after, elizabeth, s, death, soon, afterwards, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, between, england, and, spain, elizabeth, continued, to, maintain, the, diplomatic, relations, with, the, tsardom, of, russia, that, were, originally, established, by, her, half, brother, edward, vi, she, often, wrote, to, tsar, ivan, the, terrible, on, amicable, terms, though, the, tsar, was, often, annoyed, by, her, focus, on, commerce, rather, than, on, the, possibility, of, a, military, alliance, ivan, even, proposed, to, her, once, and, during, his, later, reign, asked, for, a, guarantee, to, be, granted, asylum, in, england, should, his, rule, be, jeopardised, when, this, failed, he, asked, to, marry, mary, hastings, which, elizabeth, declined, to, speak, to, the, russian, ambassador, about, english, merchant, and, explorer, anthony, jenkinson, who, began, his, career, as, a, representative, of, the, muscovy, company, became, the, queen, s, special, ambassador, to, the, court, of, tsar, ivan, upon, his, death, in, 1584, ivan, was, succeeded, by, his, son, feodor, i, unlike, his, father, feodor, had, no, enthusiasm, in, maintaining, exclusive, trading, rights, with, england, he, declared, his, kingdom, open, to, all, foreigners, and, dismissed, the, english, ambassador, jerome, bowes, whose, pomposity, had, been, tolerated, by, ivan, elizabeth, sent, a, new, ambassador, dr, giles, fletcher, to, demand, from, the, regent, boris, godunov, that, he, convince, the, tsar, to, reconsider, the, negotiations, failed, due, to, fletcher, addressing, feodor, with, two, of, his, many, titles, omitted, elizabeth, continued, to, appeal, to, feodor, in, half, appealing, half, reproachful, letters, she, proposed, an, alliance, something, which, she, had, refused, to, do, when, offered, one, by, feodor, s, father, but, was, turned, down, trade, and, diplomatic, relations, developed, between, england, and, the, barbary, states, during, the, rule, of, elizabeth, england, established, a, trading, relationship, with, morocco, in, opposition, to, spain, selling, armour, ammunition, timber, and, metal, in, exchange, for, moroccan, sugar, in, spite, of, a, papal, ban, in, 1600, abd, el, ouahed, ben, messaoud, the, principal, secretary, to, the, moroccan, ruler, mulai, ahmad, al, mansur, visited, england, as, an, ambassador, to, the, english, court, to, negotiate, an, anglo, moroccan, alliance, against, spain, elizabeth, agreed, to, sell, munitions, supplies, to, morocco, and, she, and, mulai, ahmad, al, mansur, talked, on, and, off, about, mounting, a, joint, operation, against, the, spanish, discussions, however, remained, inconclusive, and, both, rulers, died, within, two, years, of, the, embassy, diplomatic, relations, were, also, established, with, the, ottoman, empire, with, the, chartering, of, the, levant, company, and, the, dispatch, of, the, first, english, ambassador, to, the, sublime, porte, william, harborne, in, 1578, for, the, first, time, a, treaty, of, commerce, was, signed, in, 1580, numerous, envoys, were, dispatched, in, both, directions, and, epistolar, exchanges, occurred, between, elizabeth, and, sultan, murad, iii, in, one, correspondence, murad, entertained, the, notion, that, protestantism, and, islam, had, much, more, in, common, than, either, did, with, roman, catholicism, as, both, rejected, the, worship, of, idols, and, argued, for, an, alliance, between, england, and, the, ottoman, empire, to, the, dismay, of, catholic, europe, england, exported, tin, and, lead, for, cannon, casting, and, ammunitions, to, the, ottoman, empire, and, elizabeth, seriously, discussed, joint, military, operations, with, murad, iii, during, the, outbreak, of, war, with, spain, in, 1585, as, francis, walsingham, was, lobbying, for, a, direct, ottoman, military, involvement, against, the, common, spanish, enemy, in, 1583, humphrey, gilbert, sailed, west, to, establish, a, colony, in, newfoundland, he, never, returned, to, england, gilbert, s, half, brother, walter, raleigh, explored, the, atlantic, coast, and, claimed, the, territory, of, virginia, perhaps, named, in, honour, of, elizabeth, the, virgin, queen, this, territory, was, much, larger, than, the, present, day, state, of, virginia, extending, from, new, england, to, the, carolinas, in, 1585, raleigh, returned, to, virginia, with, a, small, group, of, people, they, landed, on, roanoke, island, off, present, day, north, carolina, after, the, failure, of, the, first, colony, raleigh, recruited, another, group, and, put, john, white, in, command, when, raleigh, returned, in, 1590, there, was, no, trace, of, the, roanoke, colony, he, had, left, but, it, was, the, first, english, settlement, in, north, america, the, east, india, company, was, formed, to, trade, in, the, indian, ocean, region, and, china, and, received, its, charter, from, queen, elizabeth, on, 31, december, 1600, for, a, period, of, 15, years, the, company, was, awarded, a, monopoly, on, english, trade, with, all, countries, east, of, the, cape, of, good, hope, and, west, of, the, straits, of, magellan, james, lancaster, commanded, the, first, expedition, in, 1601, the, company, eventually, controlled, half, of, world, trade, and, substantial, territory, in, india, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, period, after, the, defeat, of, the, spanish, armada, in, 1588, brought, new, difficulties, for, elizabeth, that, lasted, until, the, end, of, her, reign, the, conflicts, with, spain, and, in, ireland, dragged, on, the, tax, burden, grew, heavier, and, the, economy, was, hit, by, poor, harvests, and, the, cost, of, war, prices, rose, and, the, standard, of, living, fell, during, this, time, repression, of, catholics, intensified, and, elizabeth, authorised, commissions, in, 1591, to, interrogate, and, monitor, catholic, householders, to, maintain, the, illusion, of, peace, and, prosperity, she, increasingly, relied, on, internal, spies, and, propaganda, in, her, last, years, mounting, criticism, reflected, a, decline, in, the, public, s, affection, for, her, one, of, the, causes, for, this, second, reign, of, elizabeth, as, it, is, sometimes, called, was, the, changed, character, of, elizabeth, s, governing, body, the, privy, council, in, the, 1590s, a, new, generation, was, in, power, with, the, exception, of, william, cecil, baron, burghley, the, most, important, politicians, had, died, around, 1590, the, earl, of, leicester, in, 1588, francis, walsingham, in, 1590, and, christopher, hatton, in, 1591, factional, strife, in, the, government, which, had, not, existed, in, a, noteworthy, form, before, the, 1590s, now, became, its, hallmark, a, bitter, rivalry, arose, between, robert, devereux, the, earl, of, essex, and, robert, cecil, son, of, lord, burghley, with, both, being, supported, by, their, respective, adherents, the, struggle, for, the, most, powerful, positions, in, the, state, marred, the, kingdom, s, politics, the, queen, s, personal, authority, was, lessening, as, is, shown, in, the, 1594, affair, of, dr, roderigo, lopes, her, trusted, physician, when, he, was, wrongly, accused, by, the, earl, of, essex, of, treason, out, of, personal, pique, she, could, not, prevent, the, doctor, s, execution, although, she, had, been, angry, about, his, arrest, and, seems, not, to, have, believed, in, his, guilt, during, the, last, years, of, her, reign, elizabeth, came, to, rely, on, the, granting, of, monopolies, as, a, cost, free, system, of, patronage, rather, than, asking, parliament, for, more, subsidies, in, a, time, of, war, the, practice, soon, led, to, price, fixing, the, enrichment, of, courtiers, at, the, public, s, expense, and, widespread, resentment, this, culminated, in, agitation, in, the, house, of, commons, during, the, parliament, of, 1601, in, her, famous, golden, speech, of, 30, november, 1601, at, whitehall, palace, to, a, deputation, of, 140, members, elizabeth, professed, ignorance, of, the, abuses, and, won, the, members, over, with, promises, and, her, usual, appeal, to, the, emotions, who, keeps, their, sovereign, from, the, lapse, of, error, in, which, by, ignorance, and, not, by, intent, they, might, have, fallen, what, thank, they, deserve, we, know, though, you, may, guess, and, as, nothing, is, more, dear, to, us, than, the, loving, conservation, of, our, subjects, hearts, what, an, undeserved, doubt, might, we, have, incurred, if, the, abusers, of, our, liberality, the, thrallers, of, our, people, the, wringers, of, the, poor, had, not, been, told, us, this, same, period, of, economic, and, political, uncertainty, however, produced, an, unsurpassed, literary, flowering, in, england, the, first, signs, of, a, new, literary, movement, had, appeared, at, the, end, of, the, second, decade, of, elizabeth, s, reign, with, john, lyly, s, euphues, and, edmund, spenser, s, the, shepheardes, calender, in, 1578, during, the, 1590s, some, of, the, great, names, of, english, literature, entered, their, maturity, including, william, shakespeare, and, christopher, marlowe, continuing, into, the, jacobean, era, the, english, theatre, would, reach, its, peak, the, notion, of, a, great, elizabethan, era, depends, largely, on, the, builders, dramatists, poets, and, musicians, who, were, active, during, elizabeth, s, reign, they, owed, little, directly, to, the, queen, who, was, never, a, major, patron, of, the, arts, as, elizabeth, aged, her, image, gradually, changed, she, was, portrayed, as, belphoebe, or, astraea, and, after, the, armada, as, gloriana, the, eternally, youthful, faerie, queene, of, edmund, spenser, s, poem, elizabeth, gave, edmund, spenser, a, pension, as, this, was, unusual, for, her, it, indicates, that, she, liked, his, work, her, painted, portraits, became, less, realistic, and, more, a, set, of, enigmatic, icons, that, made, her, look, much, younger, than, she, was, in, fact, her, skin, had, been, scarred, by, smallpox, in, 1562, leaving, her, half, bald, and, dependent, on, wigs, and, cosmetics, her, love, of, sweets, and, fear, of, dentists, contributed, to, severe, tooth, decay, and, loss, to, such, an, extent, that, foreign, ambassadors, had, a, hard, time, understanding, her, speech, andr, hurault, de, maisse, ambassador, extraordinary, from, henry, iv, of, france, reported, an, audience, with, the, queen, during, which, he, noticed, her, teeth, are, very, yellow, and, unequal, and, on, the, left, side, less, than, on, the, right, many, of, them, are, missing, so, that, one, cannot, understand, her, easily, when, she, speaks, quickly, yet, he, added, her, figure, is, fair, and, tall, and, graceful, in, whatever, she, does, so, far, as, may, be, she, keeps, her, dignity, yet, humbly, and, graciously, withal, walter, raleigh, called, her, a, lady, whom, time, had, surprised, the, more, elizabeth, s, beauty, faded, the, more, her, courtiers, praised, it, elizabeth, was, happy, to, play, the, part, but, it, is, possible, that, in, the, last, decade, of, her, life, she, began, to, believe, her, own, performance, she, became, fond, and, indulgent, of, the, charming, but, petulant, young, earl, of, essex, who, was, leicester, s, stepson, and, took, liberties, with, her, for, which, she, forgave, him, she, repeatedly, appointed, him, to, military, posts, despite, his, growing, record, of, irresponsibility, after, essex, s, desertion, of, his, command, in, ireland, in, 1599, elizabeth, had, him, placed, under, house, arrest, and, the, following, year, deprived, him, of, his, monopolies, in, february, 1601, essex, tried, to, raise, a, rebellion, in, london, he, intended, to, seize, the, queen, but, few, rallied, to, his, support, and, he, was, beheaded, on, 25, february, elizabeth, knew, that, her, own, misjudgements, were, partly, to, blame, for, this, turn, of, events, an, observer, wrote, in, 1602, her, delight, is, to, sit, in, the, dark, and, sometimes, with, shedding, tears, to, bewail, essex, elizabeth, s, senior, adviser, lord, burghley, died, on, 4, august, 1598, his, political, mantle, passed, to, his, son, robert, who, soon, became, the, leader, of, the, government, one, task, he, addressed, was, to, prepare, the, way, for, a, smooth, succession, since, elizabeth, would, never, name, her, successor, robert, cecil, was, obliged, to, proceed, in, secret, he, therefore, entered, into, a, coded, negotiation, with, james, vi, of, scotland, who, had, a, strong, but, unrecognised, claim, cecil, coached, the, impatient, james, to, humour, elizabeth, and, secure, the, heart, of, the, highest, to, whose, sex, and, quality, nothing, is, so, improper, as, either, needless, expostulations, or, over, much, curiosity, in, her, own, actions, the, advice, worked, james, s, tone, delighted, elizabeth, who, responded, so, trust, i, that, you, will, not, doubt, but, that, your, last, letters, are, so, acceptably, taken, as, my, thanks, cannot, be, lacking, for, the, same, but, yield, them, to, you, in, grateful, sort, in, historian, j, e, neale, s, view, elizabeth, may, not, have, declared, her, wishes, openly, to, james, but, she, made, them, known, with, unmistakable, if, veiled, phrases, the, queen, s, health, remained, fair, until, the, autumn, of, 1602, when, a, series, of, deaths, among, her, friends, plunged, her, into, a, severe, depression, in, february, 1603, the, death, of, catherine, carey, countess, of, nottingham, the, niece, of, her, cousin, and, close, friend, lady, knollys, came, as, a, particular, blow, in, march, elizabeth, fell, sick, and, remained, in, a, settled, and, unremovable, melancholy, and, sat, motionless, on, a, cushion, for, hours, on, end, when, robert, cecil, told, her, that, she, must, go, to, bed, she, snapped, must, is, not, a, word, to, use, to, princes, little, man, she, died, on, 24, march, 1603, at, richmond, palace, between, two, and, three, in, the, morning, a, few, hours, later, cecil, and, the, council, set, their, plans, in, motion, and, proclaimed, james, king, of, england, while, it, has, become, normative, to, record, elizabeth, s, death, as, occurring, in, 1603, following, english, calendar, reform, in, the, 1750s, at, the, time, england, observed, new, year, s, day, on, 25, march, commonly, known, as, lady, day, thus, elizabeth, died, on, the, last, day, of, the, year, 1602, in, the, old, calendar, the, modern, convention, is, to, use, the, old, style, calendar, for, the, day, and, month, while, using, the, new, style, calendar, for, the, year, elizabeth, s, coffin, was, carried, downriver, at, night, to, whitehall, on, a, barge, lit, with, torches, at, her, funeral, on, 28, april, the, coffin, was, taken, to, westminster, abbey, on, a, hearse, drawn, by, four, horses, hung, with, black, velvet, in, the, words, of, the, chronicler, john, stow, westminster, was, surcharged, with, multitudes, of, all, sorts, of, people, in, their, streets, houses, windows, leads, and, gutters, that, came, out, to, see, the, obsequy, and, when, they, beheld, her, statue, lying, upon, the, coffin, there, was, such, a, general, sighing, groaning, and, weeping, as, the, like, hath, not, been, seen, or, known, in, the, memory, of, man, elizabeth, was, interred, in, westminster, abbey, in, a, tomb, shared, with, her, half, sister, mary, i, the, latin, inscription, on, their, tomb, regno, consortes, urna, hic, obdormimus, elizabetha, et, maria, sorores, in, spe, resurrectionis, translates, to, consorts, in, realm, and, tomb, here, we, sleep, elizabeth, and, mary, sisters, in, hope, of, resurrection, elizabeth, was, lamented, by, many, of, her, subjects, but, others, were, relieved, at, her, death, expectations, of, king, james, started, high, but, then, declined, by, the, 1620s, there, was, a, nostalgic, revival, of, the, cult, of, elizabeth, elizabeth, was, praised, as, a, heroine, of, the, protestant, cause, and, the, ruler, of, a, golden, age, james, was, depicted, as, a, catholic, sympathiser, presiding, over, a, corrupt, court, the, triumphalist, image, that, elizabeth, had, cultivated, towards, the, end, of, her, reign, against, a, background, of, factionalism, and, military, and, economic, difficulties, was, taken, at, face, value, and, her, reputation, inflated, godfrey, goodman, bishop, of, gloucester, recalled, when, we, had, experience, of, a, scottish, government, the, queen, did, seem, to, revive, then, was, her, memory, much, magnified, elizabeth, s, reign, became, idealised, as, a, time, when, crown, church, and, parliament, had, worked, in, constitutional, balance, the, picture, of, elizabeth, painted, by, her, protestant, admirers, of, the, early, 17th, century, has, proved, lasting, and, influential, her, memory, was, also, revived, during, the, napoleonic, wars, when, the, nation, again, found, itself, on, the, brink, of, invasion, in, the, victorian, era, the, elizabethan, legend, was, adapted, to, the, imperial, ideology, of, the, day, and, in, the, mid, 20th, century, elizabeth, was, a, romantic, symbol, of, the, national, resistance, to, foreign, threat, historians, of, that, period, such, as, j, e, neale, 1934, and, a, l, rowse, 1950, interpreted, elizabeth, s, reign, as, a, golden, age, of, progress, neale, and, rowse, also, idealised, the, queen, personally, she, always, did, everything, right, her, more, unpleasant, traits, were, ignored, or, explained, as, signs, of, stress, recent, historians, however, have, taken, a, more, complicated, view, of, elizabeth, her, reign, is, famous, for, the, defeat, of, the, armada, and, for, successful, raids, against, the, spaniards, such, as, those, on, c, diz, in, 1587, and, 1596, but, some, historians, point, to, military, failures, on, land, and, at, sea, in, ireland, elizabeth, s, forces, ultimately, prevailed, but, their, tactics, stain, her, record, rather, than, as, a, brave, defender, of, the, protestant, nations, against, spain, and, the, habsburgs, she, is, more, often, regarded, as, cautious, in, her, foreign, policies, she, offered, very, limited, aid, to, foreign, protestants, and, failed, to, provide, her, commanders, with, the, funds, to, make, a, difference, abroad, elizabeth, established, an, english, church, that, helped, shape, a, national, identity, and, remains, in, place, today, those, who, praised, her, later, as, a, protestant, heroine, overlooked, her, refusal, to, drop, all, practices, of, catholic, origin, from, the, church, of, england, historians, note, that, in, her, day, strict, protestants, regarded, the, acts, of, settlement, and, uniformity, of, 1559, as, a, compromise, in, fact, elizabeth, believed, that, faith, was, personal, and, did, not, wish, as, francis, bacon, put, it, to, make, windows, into, men, s, hearts, and, secret, thoughts, though, elizabeth, followed, a, largely, defensive, foreign, policy, her, reign, raised, england, s, status, abroad, she, is, only, a, woman, only, mistress, of, half, an, island, marvelled, pope, sixtus, v, and, yet, she, makes, herself, feared, by, spain, by, france, by, the, empire, by, all, under, elizabeth, the, nation, gained, a, new, self, confidence, and, sense, of, sovereignty, as, christendom, fragmented, elizabeth, was, the, first, tudor, to, recognise, that, a, monarch, ruled, by, popular, consent, she, therefore, always, worked, with, parliament, and, advisers, she, could, trust, to, tell, her, the, truth, a, style, of, government, that, her, stuart, successors, failed, to, follow, some, historians, have, called, her, lucky, she, believed, that, god, was, protecting, her, priding, herself, on, being, mere, english, elizabeth, trusted, in, god, honest, advice, and, the, love, of, her, subjects, for, the, success, of, her, rule, in, a, prayer, she, offered, thanks, to, god, that, when, wars, and, seditions, with, grievous, persecutions, have, vexed, almost, all, kings, and, countries, round, about, me, my, reign, hath, been, peacable, and, my, realm, a, receptacle, to, thy, afflicted, church, the, love, of, my, people,
