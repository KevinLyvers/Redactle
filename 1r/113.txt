revolutionising, the, genre, of, landscape, painting, with, his, pictures, of, dedham, vale, the, area, surrounding, his, home, now, known, as, constable, country, which, he, invested, with, an, intensity, of, affection, i, should, paint, my, own, places, best, he, wrote, to, his, friend, john, fisher, in, 1821, painting, is, but, another, word, for, feeling, constable, s, most, famous, paintings, include, wivenhoe, park, 1816, dedham, vale, 1828, and, the, hay, wain, 1821, although, his, paintings, are, now, among, the, most, popular, and, valuable, in, british, art, he, was, never, financially, successful, he, was, elected, to, the, royal, academy, of, arts, at, the, age, of, 52, his, work, was, embraced, in, france, where, he, sold, more, than, in, his, native, england, and, inspired, the, barbizon, school, john, constable, was, born, in, east, bergholt, a, village, on, the, river, stour, in, suffolk, to, golding, and, ann, watts, constable, his, father, was, a, wealthy,

stour, estuary, and, used, to, transport, corn, to, london, he, was, a, cousin, of, the, london, tea, merchant, abram, newman, although, constable, was, his, parents, second, son, his, older, brother, was, intellectually, disabled, and, john, was, expected, to, succeed, his, father, in, the, business, after, a, brief, period, at, a, boarding, school, in, lavenham, he, was, enrolled, in, a, day, school, in, dedham, essex, constable, worked, in, the, corn, business, after, leaving, school, but, his, younger, brother, abram, eventually, took, over, the, running, of, the, mills, in, his, youth, constable, embarked, on, amateur, sketching, trips, in, the, surrounding, suffolk, and, essex, countryside, which, was, to, become, the, subject, of, a, large, proportion, of, his, art, these, scenes, in, his, own, words, made, me, a, painter, and, i, am, grateful, the, sound, of, water, escaping, from, mill, dams, etc, willows, old, rotten, planks, slimy, posts, and, brickwork, i, love, such, things, he, was, introduced, to, george, beaumont, a, collector, who, showed, him, his, prized, hagar, and, the, angel, by, claude, lorrain, which, inspired, constable, later, while, visiting, relatives, in, middlesex, he, was, introduced, to, the, professional, artist, john, thomas, smith, who, advised, him, on, painting, but, also, urged, him, to, remain, in, his, father, s, business, rather, than, take, up, art, professionally, in, 1799, constable, persuaded, his, father, to, let, him, pursue, a, career, in, art, and, golding, granted, him, a, small, allowance, entering, the, royal, academy, schools, as, a, probationer, he, attended, life, classes, and, anatomical, dissections, and, studied, and, copied, old, masters, among, works, that, particularly, inspired, him, during, this, period, were, paintings, by, thomas, gainsborough, claude, lorrain, peter, paul, rubens, annibale, carracci, and, jacob, van, ruisdael, he, also, read, widely, among, poetry, and, sermons, and, later, proved, a, notably, articulate, artist, in, 1802, he, refused, the, position, of, drawing, master, at, great, marlow, military, college, now, sandhurst, a, move, which, benjamin, west, then, master, of, the, ra, counselled, would, mean, the, end, of, his, career, in, that, year, constable, wrote, a, letter, to, john, dunthorne, in, which, he, spelled, out, his, determination, to, become, a, professional, landscape, painter, for, the, last, two, years, i, have, been, running, after, pictures, and, seeking, the, truth, at, second, hand, i, have, not, endeavoured, to, represent, nature, with, the, same, elevation, of, mind, with, which, i, set, out, but, have, rather, tried, to, make, my, performances, look, like, the, work, of, other, men, there, is, room, enough, for, a, natural, painter, the, great, vice, of, the, present, day, is, bravura, an, attempt, to, do, something, beyond, the, truth, his, early, style, has, many, qualities, associated, with, his, mature, work, including, a, freshness, of, light, colour, and, touch, and, reveals, the, compositional, influence, of, the, old, masters, he, had, studied, notably, of, claude, lorrain, constable, s, usual, subjects, scenes, of, ordinary, daily, life, were, unfashionable, in, an, age, that, looked, for, more, romantic, visions, of, wild, landscapes, and, ruins, he, made, occasional, trips, farther, afield, by, 1803, he, was, exhibiting, paintings, at, the, royal, academy, in, april, he, spent, almost, a, month, aboard, the, east, indiaman, coutts, as, it, visited, south, east, ports, while, sailing, from, london, to, deal, before, leaving, for, china, in, 1806, constable, undertook, a, two, month, tour, of, the, lake, district, he, told, his, friend, and, biographer, charles, leslie, that, the, solitude, of, the, mountains, oppressed, his, spirits, and, leslie, wrote, his, nature, was, peculiarly, social, and, could, not, feel, satisfied, with, scenery, however, grand, in, itself, that, did, not, abound, in, human, associations, he, required, villages, churches, farmhouses, and, cottages, constable, adopted, a, routine, of, spending, winter, in, london, and, painting, at, east, bergholt, in, summer, in, 1811, he, first, visited, john, fisher, and, his, family, in, salisbury, a, city, whose, cathedral, and, surrounding, landscape, were, to, inspire, some, of, his, greatest, paintings, to, make, ends, meet, constable, took, up, portraiture, which, he, found, dull, though, he, executed, many, fine, portraits, he, also, painted, occasional, religious, pictures, but, according, to, john, walker, constable, s, incapacity, as, a, religious, painter, cannot, be, overstated, another, source, of, income, was, country, house, painting, in, 1816, he, was, commissioned, by, major, general, francis, slater, rebow, to, paint, his, country, home, wivenhoe, park, essex, the, major, general, also, commissioned, a, smaller, painting, of, the, fishing, lodge, in, the, grounds, of, alresford, hall, which, is, now, in, the, national, gallery, of, victoria, constable, used, the, money, from, these, commissions, towards, his, wedding, with, maria, bicknell, this, period, of, constable, s, painting, is, heavily, populated, with, idyllic, country, scenes, with, heavy, detail, notably, his, 1816, work, the, wheat, field, from, 1809, his, childhood, friendship, with, maria, elizabeth, bicknell, developed, into, a, deep, mutual, love, their, marriage, in, 1816, when, constable, was, 40, was, opposed, by, maria, s, grandfather, dr, rhudde, rector, of, east, bergholt, he, considered, the, constables, his, social, inferiors, and, threatened, maria, with, disinheritance, maria, s, father, charles, bicknell, solicitor, to, george, iv, and, the, admiralty, was, reluctant, to, see, maria, throw, away, her, inheritance, maria, pointed, out, to, john, that, a, penniless, marriage, would, detract, from, any, chances, he, had, of, making, a, career, in, painting, golding, and, ann, constable, while, approving, the, match, held, out, no, prospect, of, supporting, the, marriage, until, constable, was, financially, secure, after, they, died, in, quick, succession, constable, inherited, a, fifth, share, in, the, family, business, john, and, maria, s, marriage, in, october, 1816, at, st, martin, in, the, fields, with, fisher, officiating, was, followed, by, time, at, fisher, s, vicarage, and, a, honeymoon, tour, of, the, south, coast, the, sea, at, weymouth, and, brighton, stimulated, constable, to, develop, new, techniques, of, brilliant, colour, and, vivacious, brushwork, at, the, same, time, a, greater, emotional, range, began, to, be, expressed, in, his, art, while, on, honeymoon, constable, began, to, experiment, with, works, exploring, nature, s, grandeur, characterized, by, dominating, skies, such, as, osmington, bay, three, weeks, before, their, marriage, constable, revealed, that, he, had, started, work, on, his, most, ambitious, project, to, date, in, a, letter, to, maria, bicknell, from, east, bergholt, he, wrote, i, am, now, in, the, midst, of, a, large, picture, here, which, i, had, contemplated, for, the, next, exhibition, the, picture, was, flatford, mill, scene, on, a, navigable, river, it, was, the, largest, canvas, of, a, working, scene, on, the, river, stour, that, he, had, worked, on, to, date, and, the, largest, he, would, ever, complete, largely, outdoors, constable, was, determined, to, paint, on, a, larger, scale, his, objective, not, only, to, attract, more, attention, at, the, royal, academy, exhibitions, but, also, it, seems, to, project, his, ideas, about, landscape, on, a, scale, more, in, keeping, with, the, achievements, of, the, classical, landscape, painters, he, so, admired, although, flatford, mill, failed, to, find, a, buyer, when, it, was, exhibited, at, the, royal, academy, in, 1817, its, fine, and, intricate, execution, drew, much, praise, encouraging, constable, to, move, on, to, the, even, larger, canvases, that, were, to, follow, although, he, managed, to, scrape, an, income, from, painting, it, was, not, until, 1819, that, constable, sold, his, first, important, canvas, the, white, horse, described, by, charles, robert, leslie, as, on, many, accounts, the, most, important, picture, constable, ever, painted, the, painting, without, the, frame, sold, for, the, substantial, price, of, 100, guineas, to, his, friend, john, fisher, finally, providing, constable, with, a, level, of, financial, freedom, he, had, never, before, known, the, white, horse, marked, an, important, turning, point, in, constable, s, career, its, success, saw, him, elected, an, associate, of, the, royal, academy, and, it, led, to, a, series, of, six, monumental, landscapes, depicting, narratives, on, the, river, stour, known, as, the, six, footers, named, for, their, scale, the, extraordinary, size, of, the, works, helped, constable, attract, attention, in, the, competitive, space, of, the, academy, s, exhibitions, viewed, as, the, knottiest, and, most, forceful, landscapes, produced, in, 19th, century, europe, for, many, they, are, the, defining, works, of, the, artist, s, career, the, series, also, includes, stratford, mill, 1820, national, gallery, london, the, hay, wain, 1821, national, gallery, london, view, on, the, stour, near, dedham, 1822, huntington, library, and, art, gallery, los, angeles, county, the, lock, 1824, private, collection, and, the, leaping, horse, 1825, royal, academy, of, arts, london, the, following, year, his, second, six, footer, stratford, mill, was, exhibited, the, examiner, described, it, as, having, a, more, exact, look, of, nature, than, any, picture, we, have, ever, seen, by, an, englishman, the, painting, was, a, success, acquiring, a, buyer, in, the, loyal, john, fisher, who, purchased, it, for, 100, guineas, a, price, he, himself, thought, too, low, fisher, bought, the, painting, for, his, solicitor, and, friend, john, pern, tinney, tinney, loved, the, painting, so, much, he, offered, constable, another, 100, guineas, to, paint, a, companion, picture, an, offer, the, artist, didn, t, take, up, constable, s, growing, popularity, in, turn, led, to, more, lucrative, commissions, such, as, malvern, hall, 1821, clark, art, institute, in, 1821, his, most, famous, painting, the, hay, wain, was, shown, at, the, royal, academy, s, exhibition, although, it, failed, to, find, a, buyer, it, was, viewed, by, some, important, people, of, the, time, including, two, frenchmen, the, artist, th, odore, g, ricault, and, writer, charles, nodier, according, to, the, painter, eug, ne, delacroix, g, ricault, returned, to, france, quite, stunned, by, constable, s, painting, while, nodier, suggested, french, artists, should, also, look, to, nature, rather, than, relying, on, trips, to, rome, for, inspiration, it, was, eventually, purchased, along, with, view, on, the, stour, near, dedham, by, the, anglo, french, dealer, john, arrowsmith, in, 1824, a, small, painting, of, yarmouth, jetty, was, added, to, the, bargain, by, constable, with, the, sale, totalling, 250, both, paintings, were, exhibited, at, the, paris, salon, that, year, where, they, caused, a, sensation, with, the, hay, wain, being, awarded, a, gold, medal, by, charles, x, the, hay, wain, was, later, acquired, by, the, collector, henry, vaughan, who, donated, it, to, the, national, gallery, in, 1886, of, constable, s, colour, delacroix, wrote, in, his, journal, what, he, says, here, about, the, green, of, his, meadows, can, be, applied, to, every, tone, delacroix, repainted, the, background, of, his, 1824, massacre, de, scio, after, seeing, the, constables, at, arrowsmith, s, gallery, which, he, said, had, done, him, a, great, deal, of, good, a, number, of, distractions, meant, that, the, lock, wasn, t, finished, in, time, for, the, 1823, exhibition, leaving, the, much, smaller, salisbury, cathedral, from, the, bishop, s, grounds, as, the, artist, s, main, entry, this, may, have, occurred, after, fisher, forwarded, constable, the, money, for, the, painting, this, both, helped, him, out, of, a, financial, difficulty, and, nudged, him, along, to, get, the, painting, done, the, lock, was, therefore, exhibited, the, following, year, to, more, fanfare, and, sold, for, 150, guineas, on, the, first, day, of, the, exhibition, the, only, constable, ever, to, do, so, the, lock, is, the, only, upright, landscape, of, the, stour, series, and, the, only, six, footer, that, constable, painted, more, than, one, version, of, a, second, version, now, known, as, the, foster, version, was, painted, in, 1825, and, kept, by, the, artist, to, send, to, exhibitions, a, third, landscape, version, known, as, a, boat, passing, a, lock, 1826, is, now, in, the, collection, of, the, royal, academy, of, arts, constable, s, final, attempt, the, leaping, horse, was, the, only, six, footer, from, the, stour, series, that, didn, t, sell, in, constable, s, lifetime, constable, s, pleasure, at, his, own, success, was, dampened, after, his, wife, started, displaying, symptoms, of, tuberculosis, her, growing, illness, meant, that, constable, took, lodgings, for, his, family, in, brighton, from, 1824, until, 1828, in, the, hope, the, sea, air, could, restore, her, health, during, this, period, constable, split, his, time, between, charlotte, street, in, london, and, brighton, this, change, saw, constable, move, away, from, large, scale, stour, scenes, in, favour, of, coastal, scenes, he, continued, painting, six, foot, canvases, although, he, was, initially, unsure, of, the, suitability, of, brighton, as, a, subject, for, painting, in, a, letter, to, fisher, in, 1824, he, wrote, the, magnificence, of, the, sea, and, its, to, use, your, own, beautiful, expression, everlasting, voice, is, drowned, in, the, din, lost, in, the, tumult, of, stage, coaches, gigs, flys, c, and, the, beach, is, only, piccadilly, that, part, of, it, where, we, dined, by, the, sea, side, in, his, lifetime, constable, sold, only, 20, paintings, in, england, but, in, france, he, sold, more, than, 20, in, just, a, few, years, despite, this, he, refused, all, invitations, to, travel, internationally, to, promote, his, work, writing, to, francis, darby, i, would, rather, be, a, poor, man, than, a, rich, man, abroad, in, 1825, perhaps, due, partly, to, the, worry, of, his, wife, s, ill, health, the, uncongeniality, of, living, in, brighton, piccadilly, by, the, seaside, and, the, pressure, of, numerous, outstanding, commissions, he, quarreled, with, arrowsmith, and, lost, his, french, outlet, chain, pier, brighton, was, his, only, ambitious, six, foot, painting, of, a, brighton, subject, it, was, exhibited, in, 1827, the, constables, persevered, in, brighton, for, five, years, to, aid, maria, s, health, but, to, no, avail, after, the, birth, of, their, seventh, child, in, january, 1828, they, returned, to, hampstead, where, maria, died, on, 23, november, at, the, age, of, 41, intensely, saddened, constable, wrote, to, his, brother, golding, hourly, do, i, feel, the, loss, of, my, departed, angel, god, only, knows, how, my, children, will, be, brought, up, the, face, of, the, world, is, totally, changed, to, me, thereafter, he, dressed, in, black, and, was, according, to, leslie, a, prey, to, melancholy, and, anxious, thoughts, he, cared, for, his, seven, children, alone, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, children, were, john, charles, maria, louisa, charles, golding, isobel, emma, alfred, and, lionel, only, charles, golding, constable, produced, offspring, several, of, constable, s, children, also, painted, notably, his, son, lionel, while, lionel, eventually, gave, up, painting, for, photography, several, of, his, works, are, within, the, collection, of, the, clark, art, institute, shortly, before, maria, died, her, father, had, also, died, leaving, her, 20, 000, constable, speculated, disastrously, with, the, money, paying, for, the, engraving, of, several, mezzotints, of, some, of, his, landscapes, in, preparation, for, a, publication, he, was, hesitant, and, indecisive, nearly, fell, out, with, his, engraver, and, when, the, folios, were, published, could, not, interest, enough, subscribers, constable, collaborated, closely, with, mezzotinter, david, lucas, on, 40, prints, after, his, landscapes, one, of, which, went, through, 13, proof, stages, corrected, by, constable, in, pencil, and, paint, constable, said, lucas, showed, me, to, the, public, without, my, faults, but, the, venture, was, not, a, financial, success, this, period, saw, his, art, move, from, the, serenity, of, its, earlier, phase, to, a, more, broken, and, accented, style, the, turmoil, and, distress, of, his, mind, is, clearly, seen, in, his, later, six, foot, masterpieces, hadleigh, castle, 1829, and, salisbury, cathedral, from, the, meadows, 1831, which, are, amongst, his, most, expressive, pieces, he, was, elected, to, the, royal, academy, in, february, 1829, at, the, age, of, 52, in, 1831, he, was, appointed, visitor, at, the, royal, academy, where, he, seems, to, have, been, popular, with, the, students, he, began, to, deliver, public, lectures, on, the, history, of, landscape, painting, which, were, attended, by, distinguished, audiences, in, a, series, of, lectures, at, the, royal, institution, constable, proposed, a, three, fold, thesis, firstly, landscape, painting, is, scientific, as, well, as, poetic, secondly, the, imagination, cannot, alone, produce, art, to, bear, comparison, with, reality, and, thirdly, no, great, painter, was, ever, self, taught, he, also, spoke, against, the, new, gothic, revival, movement, which, he, considered, mere, imitation, in, 1835, his, last, lecture, to, students, of, the, royal, academy, in, which, he, praised, raphael, and, called, the, academy, the, cradle, of, british, art, was, cheered, most, heartily, he, died, on, the, night, of, 31, march, 1837, apparently, from, heart, failure, and, was, buried, with, maria, in, the, graveyard, of, st, john, at, hampstead, church, in, hampstead, in, london, his, children, john, charles, constable, and, charles, golding, constable, are, also, buried, in, this, family, tomb, bridge, cottage, is, a, national, trust, property, open, to, the, public, nearby, flatford, mill, and, willy, lott, s, cottage, the, house, visible, in, the, hay, wain, are, used, by, the, field, studies, council, for, courses, the, largest, collection, of, original, constable, paintings, outside, london, is, on, display, at, christchurch, mansion, in, ipswich, somerville, college, oxford, is, in, possession, of, a, portrait, by, constable, constable, quietly, rebelled, against, the, artistic, culture, that, taught, artists, to, use, their, imagination, to, compose, their, pictures, rather, than, nature, itself, he, told, leslie, when, i, sit, down, to, make, a, sketch, from, nature, the, first, thing, i, try, to, do, is, to, forget, that, i, have, ever, seen, a, picture, constable, attributed, his, gift, to, all, that, lay, on, the, stour, river, however, biographer, anthony, bailey, attributed, his, artistic, development, to, the, influence, of, his, well, to, do, relative, thomas, allen, and, the, london, contacts, he, introduced, constable, to, although, constable, produced, paintings, throughout, his, life, for, the, finished, picture, market, of, patrons, and, r, a, exhibitions, constant, refreshment, in, the, form, of, on, the, spot, studies, was, essential, to, his, working, method, he, was, never, satisfied, with, following, a, formula, the, world, is, wide, he, wrote, no, two, days, are, alike, nor, even, two, hours, neither, were, there, ever, two, leaves, of, a, tree, alike, since, the, creation, of, all, the, world, and, the, genuine, productions, of, art, like, those, of, nature, are, all, distinct, from, each, other, constable, painted, many, full, scale, preliminary, sketches, of, his, landscapes, to, test, the, composition, in, advance, of, finished, pictures, these, large, sketches, with, their, free, and, vigorous, brushwork, were, revolutionary, at, the, time, and, they, continue, to, interest, artists, scholars, and, the, general, public, the, oil, sketches, of, the, leaping, horse, and, the, hay, wain, for, example, convey, a, vigour, and, expressiveness, missing, from, constable, s, finished, paintings, of, the, same, subjects, possibly, more, than, any, other, aspect, of, constable, s, work, the, oil, sketches, reveal, him, in, retrospect, to, have, been, an, avant, garde, painter, one, who, demonstrated, that, landscape, painting, could, be, taken, in, a, totally, new, direction, constable, s, watercolours, were, also, remarkably, free, for, their, time, the, almost, mystical, stonehenge, 1835, with, its, double, rainbow, is, often, considered, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, watercolours, ever, painted, when, he, exhibited, it, in, 1836, constable, appended, a, text, to, the, title, the, mysterious, monument, of, stonehenge, standing, remote, on, a, bare, and, boundless, heath, as, much, unconnected, with, the, events, of, past, ages, as, it, is, with, the, uses, of, the, present, carries, you, back, beyond, all, historical, records, into, the, obscurity, of, a, totally, unknown, period, in, addition, to, the, full, scale, oil, sketches, constable, completed, numerous, observational, studies, of, landscapes, and, clouds, determined, to, become, more, scientific, in, his, recording, of, atmospheric, conditions, the, power, of, his, physical, effects, was, sometimes, apparent, even, in, the, full, scale, paintings, which, he, exhibited, in, london, the, chain, pier, 1827, for, example, prompted, a, critic, to, write, the, atmosphere, possesses, a, characteristic, humidity, about, it, that, almost, imparts, the, wish, for, an, umbrella, the, sketches, themselves, were, the, first, ever, done, in, oils, directly, from, the, subject, in, the, open, air, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, oil, sketches, pierre, henri, de, valenciennes, made, in, rome, around, 1780, to, convey, the, effects, of, light, and, movement, constable, used, broken, brushstrokes, often, in, small, touches, which, he, scumbled, over, lighter, passages, creating, an, impression, of, sparkling, light, enveloping, the, entire, landscape, one, of, the, most, expressionistic, and, powerful, of, all, his, studies, is, seascape, study, with, rain, cloud, painted, about, 1824, at, brighton, which, captures, with, slashing, dark, brushstrokes, the, immediacy, of, an, exploding, cumulus, shower, at, sea, constable, also, became, interested, in, painting, rainbow, effects, for, example, in, salisbury, cathedral, from, the, meadows, 1831, and, in, cottage, at, east, bergholt, 1833, to, the, sky, studies, he, added, notes, often, on, the, back, of, the, sketches, of, the, prevailing, weather, conditions, direction, of, light, and, time, of, day, believing, that, the, sky, was, the, key, note, the, standard, of, scale, and, the, chief, organ, of, sentiment, in, a, landscape, painting, in, this, habit, he, is, known, to, have, been, influenced, by, the, pioneering, work, of, the, meteorologist, luke, howard, on, the, classification, of, clouds, constable, s, annotations, of, his, own, copy, of, researches, about, atmospheric, phaenomena, by, thomas, forster, show, him, to, have, been, fully, abreast, of, meteorological, terminology, i, have, done, a, good, deal, of, skying, constable, wrote, to, fisher, on, 23, october, 1821, i, am, determined, to, conquer, all,
