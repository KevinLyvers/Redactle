one, and, only, studio, concert, for, the, soviet, television, what, proved, to, be, an, exhausting, affair, his, concentration, lacking, he, had, to, plod, through, several, takes, for, each, song, was, premiered, on, the, soviet, tv, eight, years, later, the, last, six, months, of, his, life, saw, vysotsky, appearing, on, stage, sporadically, fueled, by, heavy, dosages, of, drugs, and, alcohol, his, performances, were, often, erratic, occasionally, vysotsky, paid, visits, to, sklifosofsky, institute, s, er, unit, but, would, not, hear, of, marina, vlady, s, suggestions, for, him, to, take, long, term, rehabilitation, course, in, a, western, clinic, yet, he, kept, writing, mostly, poetry, and, even, prose, but, songs, as, well, the, last, song, he, performed, was, the, agonizing, my, sorrow, my, anguish, and, his, final, poem, written, one, week, prior, to, his, death, was, a, letter, to, marina, i, m, less, than, fifty, but, the, time, is, short, by, you, and, god, protected, life, and, limb, i, have, a, song, or, two, to, sing, before, the, lord, i, have, a, way, to, make, my, peace, with, him, although, several, theories, of, the, ultimate, cause, of, the, singer, s, death, persist, to, this, day, given, what, is, now, known, about, cardiovascular, disease, it, seems, likely, that, by, the, time, of, his, death, vysotsky, had, an, advanced, coronary, condition, brought, about, by, years, of, tobacco, alcohol, and, drug, abuse, as, well, as, his, grueling, work, schedule, and, the, stress, of, the, constant, harassment, by, the, government, towards, the, end, most, of, vysotsky, s, closest, friends, had, become, aware, of, the, ominous, signs, and, were, convinced, that, his, demise, was, only, a, matter, of, time, clear, evidence, of, this, can, be, seen, in, a, video, ostensibly, shot, by, the, japanese, nhk, channel, only, months, before, vysotsky, s, death, where, he, appears, visibly, unwell, breathing, heavily, and, slurring, his, speech, accounts, by, vysotsky, s, close, friends, and, colleagues, concerning, his, last, hours, were, compiled, in, the, book, by, v, perevozchikov, vysotsky, suffered, from, alcoholism, for, most, of, his, life, sometime, around, 1977, he, started, using, amphetamines, and, other, prescription, narcotics, in, an, attempt, to, counteract, the, debilitating, hangovers, and, eventually, to, rid, himself, of, alcohol, addiction, while, these, attempts, were, partially, successful, he, ended, up, trading, alcoholism, for, a, severe, drug, dependency, that, was, fast, spiralling, out, of, control, he, was, reduced, to, begging, some, of, his, close, friends, in, the, medical, profession, for, supplies, of, drugs, often, using, his, acting, skills, to, collapse, in, a, medical, office, and, imitate, a, seizure, or, some, other, condition, requiring, a, painkiller, injection, on, 25, july, 1979, a, year, to, the, day, before, his, death, he, suffered, a, cardiac, arrest, and, was, clinically, dead, for, several, minutes, during, a, concert, tour, of, soviet, uzbekistan, after, injecting, himself, with, a, wrong, kind, of, painkiller, he, had, previously, obtained, from, a, dentist, s, office, fully, aware, of, the, dangers, of, his, condition, vysotsky, made, several, attempts, to, cure, himself, of, his, addiction, he, underwent, an, experimental, and, ultimately, discredited, blood, purification, procedure, offered, by, a, leading, drug, rehabilitation, specialist, in, moscow, he, also, went, to, an, isolated, retreat, in, france, with, his, wife, marina, in, the, spring, of, 1980, as, a, way, of, forcefully, depriving, himself, of, any, access, to, drugs, after, these, attempts, failed, vysotsky, returned, to, moscow, to, find, his, life, in, an, increasingly, stressful, state, of, disarray, he, had, been, a, defendant, in, two, criminal, trials, one, for, a, car, wreck, he, had, caused, some, months, earlier, and, one, for, an, alleged, conspiracy, to, sell, unauthorized, concert, tickets, he, eventually, received, a, suspended, sentence, and, a, probation, in, the, first, case, and, the, charges, in, the, second, were, dismissed, although, several, of, his, co, defendants, were, found, guilty, he, also, unsuccessfully, fought, the, film, studio, authorities, for, the, rights, to, direct, a, movie, called, the, green, phaeton, relations, with, his, wife, marina, were, deteriorating, and, he, was, torn, between, his, loyalty, to, her, and, his, love, for, his, mistress, oksana, afanasyeva, he, had, also, developed, severe, inflammation, in, one, of, his, legs, making, his, concert, performances, extremely, challenging, in, a, final, desperate, attempt, to, overcome, his, drug, addiction, partially, prompted, by, his, inability, to, obtain, drugs, through, his, usual, channels, the, authorities, had, imposed, a, strict, monitoring, of, the, medical, institutions, to, prevent, illicit, drug, distribution, during, the, 1980, olympics, he, relapsed, into, alcohol, and, went, on, a, prolonged, drinking, binge, apparently, consuming, copious, amounts, of, champagne, due, to, a, prevalent, misconception, at, the, time, that, it, was, better, than, vodka, at, countering, the, effects, of, drug, withdrawal, on, 3, july, 1980, vysotsky, gave, a, performance, at, a, suburban, moscow, concert, hall, one, of, the, stage, managers, recalls, that, he, looked, visibly, unhealthy, gray, faced, as, she, puts, it, and, complained, of, not, feeling, too, good, while, another, says, she, was, surprised, by, his, request, for, champagne, before, the, start, of, the, show, as, he, had, always, been, known, for, completely, abstaining, from, drink, before, his, concerts, on, 16, july, vysotsky, gave, his, last, public, concert, in, kaliningrad, on, 18, july, vysotsky, played, hamlet, for, the, last, time, at, the, taganka, theatre, from, around, 21, july, several, of, his, close, friends, were, on, a, round, the, clock, watch, at, his, apartment, carefully, monitoring, his, alcohol, intake, and, hoping, against, all, odds, that, his, drug, dependency, would, soon, be, overcome, and, they, would, then, be, able, to, bring, him, back, from, the, brink, the, effects, of, drug, withdrawal, were, clearly, getting, the, better, of, him, as, he, got, increasingly, restless, moaned, and, screamed, in, pain, and, at, times, fell, into, memory, lapses, failing, to, recognize, at, first, some, of, his, visitors, including, his, son, arkadiy, at, one, point, vysotsky, s, personal, physician, a, fedotov, the, same, doctor, who, had, brought, him, back, from, clinical, death, a, year, earlier, in, uzbekistan, attempted, to, sedate, him, inadvertently, causing, asphyxiation, from, which, he, was, barely, saved, on, 24, july, vysotsky, told, his, mother, that, he, thought, he, was, going, to, die, that, day, and, then, made, similar, remarks, to, a, few, of, the, friends, present, at, the, apartment, who, begged, him, to, stop, such, talk, and, keep, his, spirits, up, but, soon, thereafter, oksana, afanasyeva, saw, him, clench, his, chest, several, times, which, led, her, to, suspect, that, he, was, genuinely, suffering, from, a, cardiovascular, condition, she, informed, fedotov, of, this, but, was, told, not, to, worry, as, he, was, going, to, monitor, vysotsky, s, condition, all, night, in, the, evening, after, drinking, relatively, small, amounts, of, alcohol, the, moaning, and, groaning, vysotsky, was, sedated, by, fedotov, who, then, sat, down, on, the, couch, next, to, him, but, fell, asleep, fedotov, awoke, in, the, early, hours, of, 25, july, to, an, unusual, silence, and, found, vysotsky, dead, in, his, bed, with, his, eyes, wide, open, apparently, of, a, myocardial, infarction, as, he, later, certified, this, was, contradicted, by, fedotov, s, colleagues, sklifosovsky, emergency, medical, institute, physicians, l, sul, povar, and, s, scherbakov, who, had, demanded, the, actor, s, immediate, hospitalization, on, 23, july, but, were, allegedly, rebuffed, by, fedotov, who, insisted, that, fedotov, s, incompetent, sedation, combined, with, alcohol, was, what, killed, vysotsky, an, autopsy, was, prevented, by, vysotsky, s, parents, who, were, eager, to, have, their, son, s, drug, addiction, remain, secret, so, the, true, cause, of, death, remains, unknown, no, official, announcement, of, the, actor, s, death, was, made, only, a, brief, obituary, appeared, in, the, moscow, newspaper, vechernyaya, moskva, and, a, note, informing, of, vysotsky, s, death, and, cancellation, of, the, hamlet, performance, was, put, out, at, the, entrance, to, the, taganka, theatre, the, story, goes, that, not, a, single, ticket, holder, took, advantage, of, the, refund, offer, despite, this, by, the, end, of, the, day, millions, had, learned, of, vysotsky, s, death, on, 28, july, he, lay, in, state, at, the, taganka, theatre, after, a, mourning, ceremony, involving, an, unauthorized, mass, gathering, of, unprecedented, scale, vysotsky, was, buried, at, the, vagankovskoye, cemetery, in, moscow, the, attendance, at, the, olympic, events, dropped, noticeably, on, that, day, as, scores, of, spectators, left, to, attend, the, funeral, tens, of, thousands, of, people, lined, the, streets, to, catch, a, glimpse, of, his, coffin, according, to, author, valery, perevozchikov, part, of, the, blame, for, his, death, lay, with, the, group, of, associates, who, surrounded, him, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, this, inner, circle, were, all, people, under, the, influence, of, his, strong, character, combined, with, a, material, interest, in, the, large, sums, of, money, his, concerts, earned, this, list, included, valerii, yankelovich, manager, of, the, taganka, theatre, and, prime, organiser, of, his, non, sanctioned, concerts, anatoly, fedotov, his, personal, doctor, vadim, tumanov, gold, prospector, and, personal, friend, from, siberia, oksana, afanasyeva, later, yarmolnik, his, mistress, the, last, three, years, of, his, life, ivan, bortnik, a, fellow, actor, and, leonid, sul, povar, a, department, head, at, the, sklifosovski, hospital, who, was, responsible, for, much, of, the, supply, of, drugs, vysotsky, s, associates, had, all, put, in, efforts, to, supply, his, drug, habit, which, kept, him, going, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, under, their, influence, he, was, able, to, continue, to, perform, all, over, the, country, up, to, a, week, before, his, death, due, to, illegal, i, e, non, state, sanctioned, sales, of, tickets, and, other, underground, methods, these, concerts, pulled, in, sums, of, money, unimaginable, in, soviet, times, when, almost, everyone, received, nearly, the, same, small, salary, the, payouts, and, gathering, of, money, were, a, constant, source, of, danger, and, yankelovich, and, others, were, needed, to, organise, them, some, money, went, to, vysotsky, the, rest, was, distributed, amongst, this, circle, at, first, this, was, a, reasonable, return, on, their, efforts, however, as, his, addiction, progressed, and, his, body, developed, resistance, the, frequency, and, amount, of, drugs, needed, to, keep, vysotsky, going, became, unmanageable, this, culminated, at, the, time, of, the, moscow, olympics, which, coincided, with, the, last, days, of, his, life, when, supplies, of, drugs, were, monitored, more, strictly, than, usual, and, some, of, the, doctors, involved, in, supplying, vysotsky, were, already, behind, bars, normally, the, doctors, had, to, account, for, every, ampule, thus, drugs, were, transferred, to, an, empty, container, while, the, patients, received, a, substitute, or, placebo, instead, in, the, last, few, days, vysotsky, became, uncontrollable, his, shouting, could, be, heard, all, over, the, apartment, building, on, malaya, gruzinskaya, st, where, he, lived, amongst, vip, s, several, days, before, his, death, in, a, state, of, stupor, he, went, on, a, high, speed, drive, around, moscow, in, an, attempt, to, obtain, drugs, and, alcohol, when, many, high, ranking, people, saw, him, this, increased, the, likelihood, of, him, being, forcibly, admitted, to, the, hospital, and, the, consequent, danger, to, the, circle, supplying, his, habit, as, his, state, of, health, declined, and, it, became, obvious, that, he, might, die, his, associates, gathered, to, decide, what, to, do, with, him, they, came, up, with, no, firm, decision, they, did, not, want, him, admitted, officially, as, his, drug, addiction, would, become, public, and, they, would, fall, under, suspicion, although, some, of, them, admitted, that, any, ordinary, person, in, his, condition, would, have, been, admitted, immediately, on, vysotsky, s, death, his, associates, and, relatives, put, in, much, effort, to, prevent, a, post, mortem, being, carried, out, this, despite, the, fairly, unusual, circumstances, he, died, aged, 42, under, heavy, sedation, with, an, improvised, cocktail, of, sedatives, and, stimulants, including, the, toxic, chloral, hydrate, provided, by, his, personal, doctor, who, had, been, supplying, him, with, narcotics, the, previous, three, years, this, doctor, being, the, only, one, present, at, his, side, when, death, occurred, had, a, few, days, earlier, been, seen, to, display, elementary, negligence, in, treating, the, sedated, vysotsky, on, the, night, of, his, death, arkadii, vysotsky, his, son, who, tried, to, visit, his, father, in, his, apartment, was, rudely, refused, entry, by, yankelovich, even, though, there, was, a, lack, of, people, able, to, care, for, him, subsequently, the, soviet, police, commenced, a, manslaughter, investigation, which, was, dropped, due, to, the, absence, of,

vysotsky, the, multifaceted, talent, of, vysotsky, is, often, described, by, the, term, bard, that, vysotsky, has, never, been, enthusiastic, about, he, thought, of, himself, mainly, as, an, actor, and, poet, rather, than, a, singer, and, once, remarked, i, do, not, belong, to, what, people, call, bards, or, minstrels, or, whatever, with, the, advent, of, portable, tape, recorders, in, the, soviet, union, vysotsky, s, music, became, available, to, the, masses, in, the, form, of, home, made, reel, to, reel, audio, tape, recordings, later, on, cassette, tapes, vysotsky, accompanied, himself, on, a, russian, seven, string, guitar, with, a, raspy, voice, singing, ballads, of, love, peace, war, everyday, soviet, life, and, of, the, human, condition, he, was, largely, perceived, as, the, voice, of, honesty, at, times, sarcastically, jabbing, at, the, soviet, government, which, made, him, a, target, for, surveillance, and, threats, in, france, he, has, been, compared, with, georges, brassens, in, russia, however, he, was, more, frequently, compared, with, joe, dassin, partly, because, they, were, the, same, age, and, died, in, the, same, year, although, their, ideologies, biographies, and, musical, styles, are, very, different, vysotsky, s, lyrics, and, style, greatly, influenced, jacek, kaczmarski, a, polish, songwriter, and, singer, who, touched, on, similar, themes, not, being, officially, recognized, as, a, poet, and, singer, vysotsky, performed, wherever, and, whenever, he, could, in, the, theater, where, he, worked, at, universities, in, private, apartments, village, clubs, and, in, the, open, air, it, was, not, unusual, for, him, to, give, several, concerts, in, one, day, he, used, to, sleep, little, using, the, night, hours, to, write, with, few, exceptions, he, wasn, t, allowed, to, publish, his, recordings, with, melodiya, which, held, a, monopoly, on, the, soviet, music, industry, his, songs, were, passed, on, through, amateur, fairly, low, quality, recordings, on, vinyl, discs, and, magnetic, tape, resulting, in, his, immense, popularity, cosmonauts, even, took, his, music, on, cassette, into, orbit, vysotsky, s, songs, over, 600, of, them, were, written, about, almost, any, imaginable, theme, the, earliest, were, blatnaya, pesnya, outlaw, songs, these, songs, were, based, either, on, the, life, of, the, common, people, in, moscow, or, on, life, in, the, crime, people, sometimes, in, gulag, vysotsky, slowly, grew, out, of, this, phase, and, started, singing, more, serious, though, often, satirical, songs, many, of, these, songs, were, about, war, these, war, songs, were, not, written, to, glorify, war, but, rather, to, expose, the, listener, to, the, emotions, of, those, in, extreme, life, threatening, situations, most, soviet, veterans, would, say, that, vysotsky, s, war, songs, described, the, truth, of, war, far, more, accurately, than, more, official, patriotic, songs, nearly, all, of, vysotsky, s, songs, are, in, the, first, person, although, he, is, almost, never, the, narrator, when, singing, his, criminal, songs, he, would, adopt, the, accent, and, intonation, of, a, moscow, thief, and, when, singing, war, songs, he, would, sing, from, the, point, of, view, of, a, soldier, in, many, of, his, philosophical, songs, he, adopted, the, role, of, inanimate, objects, in, essence, vysotsky, s, songs, were, miniature, theatrical, dramatizations, often, with, a, protagonist, and, containing, many, dialogues, he, achieved, such, a, high, level, of, authenticity, that, many, real, life, former, prisoners, war, veterans, boxers, and, footballers, refused, to, believe, that, vysotsky, had, not, himself, spent, time, behind, bars, fought, in, the, war, or, been, a, boxer, or, footballer, following, his, first, solo, concerts, at, the, leningrad, nuclear, physics, institute, he, published, a, note, for, his, fans, with, the, words, now, that, you, ve, heard, all, these, songs, please, don, t, you, make, a, mistake, of, mixing, me, with, my, characters, i, am, not, like, them, at, all, with, love, vysotsky, 20, april, 1965, xx, c, he, found, it, necessary, to, make, similar, excuses, throughout, his, career, veteran, screenwriter, nikolay, erdman, said, of, vysotsky, s, work, i, can, well, understand, how, mayakovsky, or, seryozha, yesenin, did, it, how, volodya, vysotsky, does, it, is, totally, beyond, me, however, one, of, the, themes, in, his, repertoire, was, considerably, more, autobiographical, alcoholism, with, which, he, personally, struggled, by, the, time, of, his, breakthrough, in, 1967, he, had, already, suffered, several, physical, breakdowns, and, once, was, sent, by, the, director, of, the, taganka, theatre, to, a, rehabilitation, clinic, a, visit, he, had, to, repeat, multiple, times, thereafter, musically, virtually, all, of, vysotsky, s, songs, were, written, in, a, minor, key, and, tended, to, employ, from, three, to, seven, chords, vysotsky, composed, his, songs, and, played, them, exclusively, on, the, russian, seven, string, guitar, often, tuned, a, tone, or, a, tone, and, a, half, below, the, traditional, russian, open, g, major, tuning, this, guitar, with, its, specific, russian, tuning, makes, a, slight, yet, notable, difference, in, chord, voicings, than, the, standard, tuned, six, string, spanish, classical, guitar, and, it, became, a, staple, of, his, sound, because, vysotsky, tuned, down, a, tone, and, a, half, his, strings, had, less, tension, which, also, colored, the, sound, his, earliest, songs, were, usually, written, in, c, minor, with, the, guitar, tuned, a, tone, down, from, dgbdgbd, to, cfacfac, using, the, following, chord, shapes, songs, written, in, this, key, include, stars, zvyozdy, my, friend, left, for, magadan, moy, drug, uyekhal, v, magadan, and, most, of, his, outlaw, songs, at, around, 1970, vysotsky, began, writing, and, playing, exclusively, in, a, minor, guitar, tuned, to, cfacfac, which, he, continued, doing, until, his, death, the, main, chord, shapes, he, based, his, songs, on, were, vysotsky, used, his, fingers, instead, of, a, pick, to, pluck, and, strum, as, was, the, tradition, with, russian, guitar, playing, he, used, a, variety, of, finger, picking, and, strumming, techniques, one, of, his, favorite, was, to, play, an, alternating, bass, with, his, thumb, as, he, plucked, or, strummed, with, his, other, fingers, often, vysotsky, would, neglect, to, check, the, tuning, of, his, guitar, which, is, particularly, noticeable, on, earlier, recordings, according, to, some, accounts, vysotsky, would, get, upset, when, friends, would, attempt, to, tune, his, guitar, leading, some, to, believe, that, he, preferred, to, play, slightly, out, of, tune, as, a, stylistic, choice, much, of, this, is, also, attributable, to, the, fact, that, a, guitar, that, is, tuned, down, more, than, 1, whole, step, vysotsky, would, sometimes, tune, as, much, as, 2, and, a, half, steps, down, is, prone, to, intonation, problems, apart, from, his, recognizable, raspy, voice, vysotsky, had, a, unique, singing, style, he, had, an, unusual, habit, of, elongating, consonants, instead, of, vowels, in, his, songs, so, when, a, syllable, is, sung, for, a, prolonged, period, of, time, he, would, elongate, the, consonant, instead, of, the, vowel, in, that, syllable
