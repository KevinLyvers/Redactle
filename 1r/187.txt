with, cubism, dada, and, conceptual, art, he, is, commonly, regarded, along, with, pablo, picasso, and, henri, matisse, as, one, of, the, three, artists, who, helped, to, define, the, revolutionary, developments, in, the, plastic, arts, in, the, opening, decades, of, the, 20th, century, responsible, for, significant, developments, in, painting, and, sculpture, he, has, had, an, immense, impact, on, 20th, and, 21st, century, art, and, a, seminal, influence, on, the, development, of, conceptual, art, by, the, time, of, world, war, i, he, had, rejected, the, work, of, many, of, his, fellow, artists, such, as, henri, matisse, as, retinal, intended, only, to, please, the, eye, instead, he, wanted, to, use, art, to, serve, the, mind, duchamp, was, born, at, blainville, crevon, in, normandy, france, to, eug, ne, duchamp, and, lucie, duchamp, formerly, lucie, nicolle, and, grew, up, in, a, family, that, enjoyed, cultural, activities, the, art, of, painter, and, engraver, mile, fr, d, ric,

rouen, duchamp, was, closer, to, his, sister, suzanne, who, was, a, willing, accomplice, in, games, and, activities, conjured, by, his, fertile, imagination, at, eight, years, old, duchamp, followed, in, his, brothers, footsteps, when, he, left, home, and, began, schooling, at, the, lyc, e, pierre, corneille, in, rouen, two, other, students, in, his, class, also, became, well, known, artists, and, lasting, friends, robert, antoine, pinchon, and, pierre, dumont, for, the, next, eight, years, he, was, locked, into, an, educational, regime, which, focused, on, intellectual, development, though, he, was, not, an, outstanding, student, his, best, subject, was, mathematics, and, he, won, two, mathematics, prizes, at, the, school, he, also, won, a, prize, for, drawing, in, 1903, and, at, his, commencement, in, 1904, he, won, a, coveted, first, prize, validating, his, recent, decision, to, become, an, artist, he, learned, academic, drawing, from, a, teacher, who, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, protect, his, students, from, impressionism, post, impressionism, and, other, avant, garde, influences, however, duchamp, s, true, artistic, mentor, at, the, time, was, his, brother, jacques, villon, whose, fluid, and, incisive, style, he, sought, to, imitate, at, 14, his, first, serious, art, attempts, were, drawings, and, watercolors, depicting, his, sister, suzanne, in, various, poses, and, activities, that, summer, he, also, painted, landscapes, in, an, impressionist, style, using, oils, duchamp, s, early, art, works, align, with, post, impressionist, styles, he, experimented, with, classical, techniques, and, subjects, when, he, was, later, asked, about, what, had, influenced, him, at, the, time, duchamp, cited, the, work, of, symbolist, painter, odilon, redon, whose, approach, to, art, was, not, outwardly, anti, academic, but, quietly, individual, he, studied, art, at, the, acad, mie, julian, from, 1904, to, 1905, but, preferred, playing, billiards, to, attending, classes, during, this, time, duchamp, drew, and, sold, cartoons, which, reflected, his, ribald, humor, many, of, the, drawings, use, verbal, puns, sometimes, spanning, multiple, languages, visual, puns, or, both, such, play, with, words, and, symbols, engaged, his, imagination, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1905, he, began, his, compulsory, military, service, with, the, 39th, infantry, regiment, working, for, a, printer, in, rouen, there, he, learned, typography, and, printing, processes, skills, he, would, use, in, his, later, work, owing, to, his, eldest, brother, jacques, membership, in, the, prestigious, acad, mie, royale, de, peinture, et, de, sculpture, duchamp, s, work, was, exhibited, in, the, 1908, salon, d, automne, and, the, following, year, in, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, fauves, and, paul, c, zanne, s, proto, cubism, influenced, his, paintings, although, the, critic, guillaume, apollinaire, who, was, eventually, to, become, a, friend, criticized, what, he, called, duchamp, s, very, ugly, nudes, les, nus, tr, s, vilains, de, duchamp, duchamp, also, became, lifelong, friends, with, exuberant, artist, francis, picabia, after, meeting, him, at, the, 1911, salon, d, automne, and, picabia, proceeded, to, introduce, him, to, a, lifestyle, of, fast, cars, and, high, living, in, 1911, at, jacques, home, in, puteaux, the, brothers, hosted, a, regular, discussion, group, with, cubist, artists, including, picabia, robert, delaunay, fernand, l, ger, roger, de, la, fresnaye, albert, gleizes, jean, metzinger, juan, gris, and, alexander, archipenko, poets, and, writers, also, participated, the, group, came, to, be, known, as, the, puteaux, group, or, the, section, d, or, uninterested, in, the, cubists, seriousness, or, in, their, focus, on, visual, matters, duchamp, did, not, join, in, discussions, of, cubist, theory, and, gained, a, reputation, of, being, shy, however, that, same, year, he, painted, in, a, cubist, style, and, added, an, impression, of, motion, by, using, repetitive, imagery, during, this, period, duchamp, s, fascination, with, transition, change, movement, and, distance, became, manifest, and, as, many, artists, of, the, time, he, was, intrigued, with, the, concept, of, depicting, the, fourth, dimension, in, art, his, painting, sad, young, man, on, a, train, embodies, this, concern, first, there, s, the, idea, of, the, movement, of, the, train, and, then, that, of, the, sad, young, man, who, is, in, a, corridor, and, who, is, moving, about, thus, there, are, two, parallel, movements, corresponding, to, each, other, then, there, is, the, distortion, of, the, young, man, i, had, called, this, elementary, parallelism, it, was, a, formal, decomposition, that, is, linear, elements, following, each, other, like, parallels, and, distorting, the, object, the, object, is, completely, stretched, out, as, if, elastic, the, lines, follow, each, other, in, parallels, while, changing, subtly, to, form, the, movement, or, the, form, of, the, young, man, in, question, i, also, used, this, procedure, in, the, nude, descending, a, staircase, in, his, 1911, portrait, of, chess, players, portrait, de, joueurs, d, checs, there, is, the, cubist, overlapping, frames, and, multiple, perspectives, of, his, two, brothers, playing, chess, but, to, that, duchamp, added, elements, conveying, the, unseen, mental, activity, of, the, players, works, from, this, time, also, included, his, first, machine, painting, coffee, mill, moulin, caf, 1911, which, he, gave, to, his, brother, raymond, duchamp, villon, the, later, more, figurative, machine, painting, of, 1914, chocolate, grinder, broyeuse, de, chocolat, prefigures, the, mechanism, incorporated, into, the, large, glass, on, which, he, began, work, in, new, york, the, following, year, duchamp, s, first, work, to, provoke, significant, controversy, was, nude, descending, a, staircase, no, 2, nu, descendant, un, escalier, n, 2, 1912, the, painting, depicts, the, mechanistic, motion, of, a, nude, with, superimposed, facets, similar, to, motion, pictures, it, shows, elements, of, both, the, fragmentation, and, synthesis, of, the, cubists, and, the, movement, and, dynamism, of, the, futurists, he, first, submitted, the, piece, to, appear, at, the, cubist, salon, des, ind, pendants, but, albert, gleizes, according, to, duchamp, in, an, interview, with, pierre, cabanne, p, 31, asked, duchamp, s, brothers, to, have, him, voluntarily, withdraw, the, painting, or, to, paint, over, the, title, that, he, had, painted, on, the, work, and, rename, it, something, else, duchamp, s, brothers, did, approach, him, with, gleizes, request, but, duchamp, quietly, refused, however, there, was, no, jury, at, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, and, gleizes, was, in, no, position, to, reject, the, painting, the, controversy, according, to, art, historian, peter, brooke, was, not, whether, the, work, should, be, hung, or, not, but, whether, it, should, be, hung, with, the, cubist, group, of, the, incident, duchamp, later, recalled, i, said, nothing, to, my, brothers, but, i, went, immediately, to, the, show, and, took, my, painting, home, in, a, taxi, it, was, really, a, turning, point, in, my, life, i, can, assure, you, i, saw, that, i, would, not, be, very, much, interested, in, groups, after, that, yet, duchamp, did, appear, in, the, illustrations, to, du, cubisme, he, participated, in, the, la, maison, cubiste, cubist, house, organized, by, the, designer, andr, mare, for, the, salon, d, automne, of, 1912, a, few, months, after, the, ind, pendants, he, signed, the, section, d, or, invitation, and, participated, in, the, section, d, or, exhibition, during, the, fall, of, 1912, the, impression, is, brooke, writes, it, was, precisely, because, he, wished, to, remain, part, of, the, group, that, he, withdrew, the, painting, and, that, far, from, being, ill, treated, by, the, group, he, was, given, a, rather, privileged, position, probably, through, the, patronage, of, picabia, the, painting, was, exhibited, for, the, first, time, at, galeries, dalmau, exposici, d, art, cubista, barcelona, 1912, the, first, exhibition, of, cubism, in, spain, duchamp, later, submitted, the, painting, to, the, 1913, armory, show, in, new, york, city, in, addition, to, displaying, works, of, american, artists, this, show, was, the, first, major, exhibition, of, modern, trends, coming, out, of, paris, encompassing, experimental, styles, of, the, european, avant, garde, including, fauvism, cubism, and, futurism, american, show, goers, accustomed, to, realistic, art, were, scandalized, and, the, nude, was, at, the, center, of, much, of, the, controversy, at, about, this, time, duchamp, read, max, stirner, s, philosophical, tract, the, ego, and, its, own, the, study, which, he, considered, another, turning, point, in, his, artistic, and, intellectual, development, he, called, it, a, remarkable, book, which, advances, no, formal, theories, but, just, keeps, saying, that, the, ego, is, always, there, in, everything, while, in, munich, in, 1912, he, painted, the, last, of, his, cubist, like, paintings, he, started, the, bride, stripped, bare, by, her, bachelors, even, image, and, began, making, plans, for, the, large, glass, scribbling, short, notes, to, himself, sometimes, with, hurried, sketches, it, would, be, more, than, ten, years, before, this, piece, was, completed, not, much, else, is, known, about, the, two, month, stay, in, munich, except, that, the, friend, he, visited, was, intent, on, showing, him, the, sights, and, the, nightlife, and, that, he, was, influenced, by, the, works, of, the, sixteenth, century, german, painter, lucas, cranach, the, elder, in, munich, s, famed, alte, pinakothek, known, for, its, old, master, paintings, duchamp, recalled, that, he, took, the, short, walk, to, visit, this, museum, daily, duchamp, scholars, have, long, recognized, in, cranach, the, subdued, ochre, and, brown, color, range, duchamp, later, employed, the, same, year, duchamp, also, attended, a, performance, of, a, stage, adaptation, of, raymond, roussel, s, 1910, novel, impressions, d, afrique, which, featured, plots, that, turned, in, on, themselves, word, play, surrealistic, sets, and, humanoid, machines, he, credited, the, drama, with, having, radically, changed, his, approach, to, art, and, having, inspired, him, to, begin, the, creation, of, his, the, bride, stripped, bare, by, her, bachelors, even, also, known, as, the, large, glass, work, on, the, large, glass, continued, into, 1913, with, his, invention, of, inventing, a, repertoire, of, forms, he, made, notes, sketches, and, painted, studies, and, even, drew, some, of, his, ideas, on, the, wall, of, his, apartment, toward, the, end, of, 1912, he, traveled, with, picabia, apollinaire, and, gabrielle, buffet, picabia, through, the, jura, mountains, an, adventure, that, buffet, picabia, described, as, one, of, their, forays, of, demoralization, which, were, also, forays, of, witticism, and, clownery, the, disintegration, of, the, concept, of, art, duchamp, s, notes, from, the, trip, avoid, logic, and, sense, and, have, a, surrealistic, mythical, connotation, duchamp, painted, few, canvases, after, 1912, and, in, those, he, did, he, attempted, to, remove, painterly, effects, and, to, use, a, technical, drawing, approach, instead, his, broad, interests, led, him, to, an, exhibition, of, aviation, technology, during, this, period, after, which, duchamp, said, to, his, friend, constantin, br, ncu, i, painting, is, washed, up, who, will, ever, do, anything, better, than, that, propeller, tell, me, can, you, do, that, br, ncu, i, later, sculpted, bird, forms, u, s, customs, officials, mistook, them, for, aviation, parts, and, attempted, to, collect, import, duties, on, them, in, 1913, duchamp, withdrew, from, painting, circles, and, began, working, as, a, librarian, in, the, biblioth, que, sainte, genevi, ve, to, be, able, to, earn, a, living, wage, while, concentrating, on, scholarly, realms, and, working, on, his, large, glass, he, studied, math, and, physics, areas, where, exciting, new, discoveries, were, taking, place, the, theoretical, writings, of, henri, poincar, particularly, intrigued, and, inspired, duchamp, poincar, postulated, that, the, laws, believed, to, govern, matter, were, created, solely, by, the, minds, that, understood, them, and, that, no, theory, could, be, considered, true, the, things, themselves, are, not, what, science, can, reach, but, only, the, relations, between, things, outside, of, these, relations, there, is, no, knowable, reality, poincar, wrote, in, 1902, reflecting, the, influence, of, poincar, s, writings, duchamp, tolerated, any, interpretation, of, his, art, by, regarding, it, as, the, creation, of, the, person, who, formulated, it, not, as, truth, duchamp, s, own, art, science, experiments, began, during, his, tenure, at, the, library, to, make, one, of, his, favorite, pieces, 3, standard, stoppages, 3, stoppages, talon, he, dropped, three, 1, meter, lengths, of, thread, onto, prepared, canvases, one, at, a, time, from, a, height, of, 1, meter, the, threads, landed, in, three, random, undulating, positions, he, varnished, them, into, place, on, the, blue, black, canvas, strips, and, attached, them, to, glass, he, then, cut, three, wood, slats, into, the, shapes, of, the, curved, strings, and, put, all, the, pieces, into, a, croquet, box, three, small, leather, signs, with, the, title, printed, in, gold, were, glued, to, the, stoppage, backgrounds, the, piece, appears, to, literally, follow, poincar, s, school, of, the, thread, part, of, a, book, on, classical, mechanics, in, his, studio, he, mounted, a, bicycle, wheel, upside, down, onto, a, stool, spinning, it, occasionally, just, to, watch, it, although, it, is, often, assumed, that, the, bicycle, wheel, represents, the, first, of, duchamp, s, readymades, this, particular, installation, was, never, submitted, for, any, art, exhibition, and, it, was, eventually, lost, however, initially, the, wheel, was, simply, placed, in, the, studio, to, create, atmosphere, i, enjoyed, looking, at, it, just, as, i, enjoy, looking, at, the, flames, dancing, in, a, fireplace, after, world, war, i, started, in, august, 1914, with, his, brothers, and, many, friends, in, military, service, and, himself, exempted, due, to, a, heart, murmur, duchamp, felt, uncomfortable, in, paris, meanwhile, nude, descending, a, staircase, no, 2, had, scandalized, americans, at, the, armory, show, and, helped, secure, the, sale, of, all, four, of, his, paintings, in, the, exhibition, thus, being, able, to, finance, the, trip, duchamp, decided, to, emigrate, to, the, united, states, in, 1915, to, his, surprise, he, found, he, was, a, celebrity, when, he, arrived, in, new, york, in, 1915, where, he, quickly, befriended, art, patron, katherine, dreier, and, artist, man, ray, duchamp, s, circle, included, art, patrons, louise, and, walter, conrad, arensberg, actress, and, artist, beatrice, wood, and, francis, picabia, as, well, as, other, avant, garde, figures, though, he, spoke, little, english, in, the, course, of, supporting, himself, by, giving, french, lessons, and, through, some, library, work, he, quickly, learned, the, language, duchamp, became, part, of, an, artist, colony, in, ridgefield, new, jersey, across, the, hudson, river, from, new, york, city, for, two, years, the, arensbergs, who, would, remain, his, friends, and, patrons, for, 42, years, were, the, landlords, of, his, studio, in, lieu, of, rent, they, agreed, that, his, payment, would, be, the, large, glass, an, art, gallery, offered, duchamp, 10, 000, per, year, in, exchange, for, all, of, his, yearly, production, but, he, declined, the, offer, preferring, to, continue, his, work, on, the, large, glass, duchamp, created, the, soci, t, anonyme, in, 1920, along, with, katherine, dreier, and, man, ray, this, was, the, beginning, of, his, lifelong, involvement, in, art, dealing, and, collecting, the, group, collected, modern, art, works, and, arranged, modern, art, exhibitions, and, lectures, throughout, the, 1930s, by, this, time, walter, pach, one, of, the, coordinators, of, the, 1913, armory, show, sought, duchamp, s, advice, on, modern, art, beginning, with, soci, t, anonyme, dreier, also, depended, on, duchamp, s, counsel, in, gathering, her, collection, as, did, arensberg, later, peggy, guggenheim, museum, of, modern, art, directors, alfred, barr, and, james, johnson, sweeney, consulted, with, duchamp, on, their, modern, art, collections, and, shows, dada, or, dadaism, was, an, art, movement, of, the, european, avant, garde, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, began, in, z, rich, switzerland, in, 1916, and, spread, to, berlin, shortly, thereafter, to, quote, dona, budd, s, the, language, of, art, knowledge, dada, was, born, out, of, negative, reaction, to, the, horrors, of, world, war, i, this, international, movement, was, begun, by, a, group, of, artists, and, poets, associated, with, the, cabaret, voltaire, in, z, rich, dada, rejected, reason, and, logic, prizing, nonsense, irrationality, and, intuition, the, origin, of, the, name, dada, is, unclear, some, believe, that, it, is, a, nonsense, word, others, maintain, that, it, originates, from, the, romanian, artists, tristan, tzara, and, marcel, janco, s, frequent, use, of, the, words, da, da, meaning, yes, yes, in, the, romanian, language, another, theory, says, that, the, name, dada, came, during, a, meeting, of, the, group, when, a, paper, knife, stuck, into, a, french, german, dictionary, happened, to, point, to, dada, a, french, word, for, hobbyhorse, the, movement, primarily, involved, visual, arts, literature, poetry, art, manifestoes, art, theory, theatre, and, graphic, design, and, concentrated, its, anti, war, politics, through, a, rejection, of, the, prevailing, standards, in, art, through, anti, art, cultural, works, in, addition, to, being, anti, war, dada, was, also, anti, bourgeois, and, had, political, affinities, with, the, radical, left, dada, activities, included, public, gatherings, demonstrations, and, publication, of, art, literary, journals, passionate, coverage, of, art, politics, and, culture, were, topics, often, discussed, in, a, variety, of, media, key, figures, in, the, movement, apart, from, duchamp, included, hugo, ball, emmy, hennings, hans, arp, raoul, hausmann, hannah, h, ch, johannes, baader, tristan, tzara, francis, picabia, richard, huelsenbeck, georg, grosz, john, heartfield, beatrice, wood, kurt, schwitters, and, hans, richter, among, others, the, movement, influenced, later, styles, such, as, the, avant, garde, and, downtown, music, movements, and, groups, including, surrealism, nouveau, r, alisme, pop, art, and, fluxus, dada, is, the, groundwork, to, abstract, art, and, sound, poetry, a, starting, point, for, performance, art, a, prelude, to, postmodernism, an, influence, on, pop, art, a, celebration, of, antiart, to, be, later, embraced, for, anarcho, political, uses, in, the, 1960s, and, the, movement, that, lay, the, foundation, for, surrealism, new, york, dada, had, a, less, serious, tone, than, that, of, european, dadaism, and, was, not, a, particularly, organized, venture, duchamp, s, friend, francis, picabia, connected, with, the, dada, group, in, z, rich, bringing, to, new, york, the, dadaist, ideas, of, absurdity, and, anti, art, duchamp, and, picabia, first, met, in, september, 1911, at, the, salon, d, automne, in, paris, where, they, were, both, exhibiting, duchamp, showed, a, larger, version, of, his, young, man, and, girl, in, spring, 1911, a, work, that, had, an, edenic, theme, and, a, thinly, veiled, sexuality, also, found, in, picabia, s, contemporaneous, adam, and, eve, 1911, according, to, duchamp, our, friendship, began, right, there, a, group, met, almost, nightly, at, the, arensberg, home, or, caroused, in, greenwich, village, together, with, man, ray, duchamp, contributed, his, ideas, and, humor, to, the, new, york, activities, many, of, which, ran, concurrent, with, the, development, of, his, readymades, and, the, large, glass, the, most, prominent, example, of, duchamp, s, association, with, dada, was, his, submission, of, fountain, a, urinal, to, the, society, of, independent, artists, exhibit, in, 1917, artworks, in, the, independent, artists, shows, were, not, selected, by, jury, and, all, pieces, submitted, were, displayed, however, the, show, committee, insisted, that, fountain, was, not, art, and, rejected, it, from, the, show, this, caused, an, uproar, among, the, dadaists, and, led, duchamp, to, resign, from, the, board, of, the, independent, artists, 181, 186, along, with, henri, pierre, roch, and, beatrice, wood, duchamp, published, multiple, dada, magazines, in, new, york, including, the, blind, man, and, rongwrong, which, included, art, literature, humor, and, commentary, when, he, returned, to, paris, after, world, war, i, duchamp, did, not, participate, in, the, dada, group, readymades, were, found, objects, which, duchamp, chose, and, presented, as, art, in, 1913, duchamp, installed, a, bicycle, wheel, in, his, studio, the, bicycle, wheel, was, an, idea, of, elsa, von, freytag, loringhoven, however, the, idea, of, readymades, did, not, fully, develop, until, 1915, the, idea, was, to, question, the, very, notion, of, art, and, the, adoration, of, art, which, duchamp, found, unnecessary, my, idea, was, to, choose, an, object, that, wouldn, t, attract, me, either, by, its, beauty, or, by, its, ugliness, to, find, a, point, of, indifference, in, my, looking, at, it, you, see, bottle, rack, 1914, a, bottle, drying, rack, signed, by, duchamp, is, considered, to, be, the, first, pure, readymade, in, advance, of, the, broken, arm, 1915, a, snow, shovel, also, called, prelude, to, a, broken, arm, followed, soon, after, his, fountain, a, urinal, signed, with, the, pseudonym, r, mutt, shocked, the, art, world, in, 1917, fountain, was, selected, in, 2004, as, the, most, influential, artwork, of, the, 20th, century, by, 500, renowned, artists, and, historians, in, 1919, duchamp, made, a, parody, of, the, mona, lisa, by, adorning, a, cheap, reproduction, of, the, painting, with, a, mustache, and, goatee, to, this, he, added, the, inscription, l, h, o, o, q, a, phonetic, game, which, when, read, out, loud, in, french, quickly, sounds, like, elle, a, chaud, au, cul, this, can, be, translated, as, she, has, a, hot, ass, implying, that, the, woman, in, the, painting, is, in, a, state, of, sexual, excitement, and, availability, it, may, also, have, been, intended, as, a, freudian, joke, referring, to, leonardo, da, vinci, s, alleged, homosexuality, duchamp, gave, a, loose, translation, of, l, h, o, o, q, as, there, is, fire, down, below, in, a, late, interview, with, arturo, schwarz, according, to, rhonda, roland, shearer, the, apparent, mona, lisa, reproduction, is, in, fact, a, copy, modeled, partly, on, duchamp, s, own, face, research, published, by, shearer, also, speculates, that, duchamp, himself, may, have, created, some, of, the, objects, which, he, claimed, to, be, found, objects, in, 2017, 2018, the, french, expert, johann, naldi, found, and, identified, seventeen, unpublished, works, in, a, private, collection, classified, as, a, national, treasure, on, may, 7, 2021, by, the, french, ministry, of, culture, including, des, souteneurs, encore, dans, la, force, de, l, ge, et, le, ventre, dans, l, herbe, by, alphonse, allais, consisting, of, a, green, carriage, curtain, suspended, from, a, wooden, cylinder, this, work, was, certainly, exhibited, at, the, incoherents, exhibitions, in, paris, between, 1883, and, 1893, according, to, johann, naldi, this, work, is, the, oldest, known, readymade, and, was, a, source, of, inspiration, for, marcel, duchamp, duchamp, worked, on, his, complex, futurism, inspired, piece, the, bride, stripped, bare, by, her, bachelors, even, the, large, glass, from, 1915, to, 1923, except, for, periods, in, buenos, aires, and, paris, in, 1918, 1920, he, executed, the, work, on, two, panes, of, glass, with, materials, such, as, lead, foil, fuse, wire, and, dust, it, combines, chance, procedures, plotted, perspective, studies, and, laborious, craftsmanship, he, published, notes, for, the, piece, the, green, box, intended, to, complement, the, visual, experience, they, reflect, the, creation, of, unique, rules, of, physics, and, a, mythology, which, describes, the, work, he, stated, that, his, hilarious, picture, is, intended, to, depict, the, erotic, encounter, between, a, bride, and, her, nine, bachelors, a, performance, of, the, stage, adaptation, of, raymond, roussel, s, novel, impressions, d, afrique, which, duchamp, attended, in, 1912, inspired, the, piece, notes, sketches, and, plans, for, the, work, were, drawn, on, his, studio, walls, as, early, as, 1913, to, concentrate, on, the, work, free, from, material, obligations, duchamp, found, work, as, a, librarian, while, living, in, france, after, immigrating, to, the, united, states, in, 1915, he, began, work, on, the, piece, financed, by, the, support, of, the, arensbergs, the, piece, is, partly, constructed, as, a, retrospective, of, duchamp, s, works, including, a, three, dimensional, reproduction, of, his, earlier, paintings, bride, 1912, chocolate, grinder, 1914, and, glider, containing, a, water, mill, in, neighboring, metals, 1913, 1915, which, has, led, to, numerous, interpretations, the, work, was, formally, declared, unfinished, in, 1923, returning, from, its, first, public, exhibition, in, a, shipping, crate, the, glass, suffered, a, large, crack, duchamp, repaired, it, but, left, the, smaller, cracks, in, the, glass, intact, accepting, the, chance, element, as, a, part, of, the, piece, joseph, nechvatal, has, cast, a, considerable, light, on, the, large, glass, by, noting, the, autoerotic, implications, of, both, bachelorhood, and, the, repetitive, frenetic, machine, he, then, discerns, a, larger, constellation, of, themes, by, insinuating, that, autoeroticsm, and, with, the, machine, as, omnipresent, partner, and, practitioner, opens, out, into, a, subversive, pan, sexuality, as, expressed, elsewhere, in, duchamp, s, work, and, career, in, that, a, trance, inducing, pleasure, becomes, the, operative, principle, as, opposed, to, the, dictates, of, the, traditional, male, female, coupling, and, he, as, well, documents, the, existence, of, this, theme, cluster, throughout, modernism, starting, with, rodin, s, controversial, monument, to, balzac, and, culminating, in, a, duchampian, vision, of, a, techno, universe, in, which, one, and, all, can, find, themselves, welcomed, until, 1969, when, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, revealed, duchamp, s, tant, donn, s, tableau, the, large, glass, was, thought, to, have, been, his, last, major, work, duchamp, s, interest, in, kinetic, art, works, can, be, discerned, as, early, as, the, notes, for, the, large, glass, and, the, bicycle, wheel, readymade, and, despite, losing, interest, in, retinal, art, he, retained, interest, in, visual, phenomena, in, 1920, with, help, from, man, ray, duchamp, built, a, motorized, sculpture, rotative, plaques, verre, optique, de, pr, cision, rotary, glass, plates, precision, optics, the, piece, which, he, did, not, consider, to, be, art, involved, a, motor, to, spin, pieces, of, rectangular, glass, on, which, were, painted, segments, of, a, circle, when, the, apparatus, spins, an, optical, illusion, occurs, where, the, segments, appear, to, be, closed, concentric, circles, man, ray, set, up, equipment, to, photograph, the, initial, experiment, but, when, they, turned, the, machine, for, the, second, time, a, drive, belt, broke, and, caught, a, piece, of, the, glass, which, after, glancing, off, man, ray, s, head, shattered, into, bits, 227, 228, after, moving, back, to, paris, in, 1923, at, andr, breton, s, urging, with, financing, by, jacques, doucet, duchamp, built, another, optical, device, based, on, the, first, one, rotative, demisph, re, optique, de, pr, cision, rotary, demisphere, precision, optics, this, time, the, optical, element, was, a, globe, cut, in, half, with, black, concentric, circles, painted, on, it, when, it, spins, the, circles, appear, to, move, backward, and, forward, in, space, duchamp, asked, that, doucet, not, exhibit, the, apparatus, as, art, 254, 255, rotoreliefs, were, the, next, phase, of, duchamp, s, spinning, works, to, make, the, optical, play, toys, he, painted, designs, on, flat, cardboard, circles, and, spun, them, on, a, phonographic, turntable, when, spinning, the, flat, disks, appeared, three, dimensional, he, had, a, printer, produce, 500, sets, of, six, of, the, designs, and, set, up, a, booth, at, a, 1935, paris, inventors, show, to, sell, them, the, venture, was, a, financial, disaster, but, some, optical, scientists, thought, they, might, be, of, use, in, restoring, three, dimensional, stereoscopic, sight, to, people, who, have, lost, vision, in, one, eye, 301, 303, in, collaboration, with, man, ray, and, marc, all, gret, duchamp, filmed, early, versions, of, the, rotoreliefs, and, they, named, the, film, an, mic, cin, ma, 1926, later, in, alexander, calder, s, studio, in, 1931, while, looking, at, the, sculptor, s, kinetic, works, duchamp, suggested, that, these, should, be, called, mobiles, calder, agreed, to, use, this, novel, term, in, his, upcoming, show, to, this, day, sculptures, of, this, type, are, called, mobiles, 294, between, 1912, and, 1915, duchamp, worked, with, various, musical, ideas, at, least, three, pieces, have, survived, two, compositions, and, a, note, for, a, musical, happening, the, two, compositions, are, based, on, chance, operations, erratum, musical, written, for, three, voices, was, published, in, 1934, la, mari, e, mise, nu, par, ses, c, libataires, m, me, erratum, musical, is, unfinished, and, was, never, published, or, exhibited, during, duchamp, s, lifetime, according, to, the, manuscript, the, piece, was, intended, for, a, mechanical, instrument, in, which, the, virtuoso, intermediary, is, suppressed, the, manuscript, also, contains, a, description, for, an, apparatus, automatically, recording, fragmented, musical, periods, consisting, of, a, funnel, several, open, end, cars, and, a, set, of, numbered, balls, these, pieces, predate, john, cage, s, music, of, changes, 1951, which, is, often, considered, the, first, modern, piece, to, be, conceived, largely, through, random, procedures, in, 1968, duchamp, and, john, cage, appeared, together, at, a, concert, entitled, reunion, playing, a, game, of, chess, and, composing, aleatoric, music, by, triggering, a, series, of, photoelectric, cells, underneath, the, chessboard, rrose, s, lavy, also, spelled, rose, s, lavy, was, one, of, duchamp, s, pseudonyms, the, name, a, pun, sounds, like, the, french, phrase, eros, c, est, la, vie, which, may, be, translated, as, eros, such, is, life, it, has, also, been, read, as, arroser, la, vie, to, make, a, toast, to, life, s, lavy, emerged, in, 1921, in, a, series, of, photographs, by, man, ray, showing, duchamp, dressed, as, a, woman, through, the, 1920s, man, ray, and, duchamp, collaborated, on, more, photos, of, s, lavy, duchamp, later, used, the, name, as, the, byline, on, written, material, and, signed, several, creations, with, it, duchamp, used, the, name, in, the, title, of, at, least, one, sculpture, why, not, sneeze, rose, s, lavy, 1921, the, sculpture, a, type, of, readymade, called, an, assemblage, consists, of, an, oral, thermometer, a, couple, of, dozen, small, cubes, of, marble, resembling, sugar, cubes, and, a, cuttlefish, bone, inside, a, birdcage, s, lavy, also, appears, on, the, label, of, belle, haleine, eau, de, voilette, 1921, a, readymade, that, is, a, perfume, bottle, in, the, original, box, duchamp, also, signed, his, film, an, mic, cin, ma, 1926, with, the, s, lavy, name, the, inspiration, for, the, name, rrose, s, lavy, has, been, thought, to, be, belle, da, costa, greene, j, p, morgan, s, librarian, at, the, morgan, library, museum, formerly, the, pierpont, morgan, library, who, following, his, death, became, the, library, s, director, working, there, for, a, total, of, forty, three, years, empowered, by, j, p, morgan, and, then, by, his, son, jack, greene, built, the, collection, buying, and, selling, rare, manuscripts, books, and, art, rrose, s, lavy, and, the, other, pseudonyms, duchamp, used, may, be, read, as, a, comment, on, the, fallacy, of, romanticizing, the, conscious, individuality, or, subjectivity, of, the, artist, a, theme, that, is, also, a, prominent, subtext, of, the, readymades, duchamp, said, in, an, interview, you, think, you, re, doing, something, entirely, your, own, and, a, year, later, you, look, at, it, and, you, see, actually, the, roots, of, where, your, art, comes, from, without, your, knowing, it, at, all, the, p, rez, art, museum, miami, in, florida, holds, the, piece, bo, te, en, valise, de, ou, par, marcel, duchamp, ou, rrose, s, lavy, or, in, english, box, in, a, valise, from, or, by, marcel, duchamp, or, rrose, s, lavy, created, from, 1941, 61, in, the, museum, s, collection, from, 1922, the, name, rrose, s, lavy, also, started, appearing, in, a, series, of, aphorisms, puns, and, spoonerisms, by, the, french, surrealist, poet, robert, desnos, desnos, tried, to, portray, rrose, s, lavy, as, a, long, lost, aristocrat, and, rightful, queen, of, france, aphorism, 13, paid, homage, to, marcel, duchamp, rrose, s, lavy, conna, t, bien, le, marchand, du, sel, in, english, rrose, s, lavy, knows, the, merchant, of, salt, well, in, french, the, final, words, sound, like, mar, champ, du, cel, note, that, the, salt, seller, aphorism, mar, chand, du, sel, is, a, phonetic, anagram, of, the, artist, s, name, mar, cel, du, champ, duchamp, s, compiled, notes, are, entitled, salt, seller, in, 1939, a, collection, of, these, aphorisms, was, published, under, the, name, of, rrose, s, lavy, entitled, poils, et, coups, de, pieds, en, tous, genres, in, 1918, duchamp, took, leave, of, the, new, york, art, scene, interrupting, his, work, on, the, large, glass, and, went, to, buenos, aires, where, he, remained, for, nine, months, and, often, played, chess, he, carved, his, own, chess, set, from, wood, with, help, from, a, local, craftsman, who, made, the, knights, he, moved, to, paris, in, 1919, and, then, back, to, the, united, states, in, 1920, upon, his, return, to, paris, in, 1923, duchamp, was, in, essence, no, longer, a, practicing, artist, instead, his, main, interest, was, chess, which, he, studied, for, the, rest, of, his, life, to, the, exclusion, of, most, other, activities, duchamp, is, seen, briefly, playing, chess, with, man, ray, in, the, short, film, entr, acte, 1924, by, ren, clair, he, designed, the, 1925, poster, for, the, third, french, chess, championship, and, as, a, competitor, in, the, event, finished, at, fifty, percent, 3, 3, with, two, draws, earning, the, title, of, chess, master, during, this, period, his, fascination, with, chess, so, distressed, his, first, wife, that, she, glued, his, pieces, to, the, chessboard, duchamp, continued, to, play, in, the, french, championships, and, in, the, chess, olympiads, from, 1928, to, 1933, favoring, hypermodern, openings, such, as, the, nimzo, indian, sometime, in, the, early, 1930s, duchamp, reached, the, height, of, his, ability, but, realized, that, he, had, little, chance, of, winning, recognition, in, top, level, chess, in, the, following, years, his, participation, in, chess, tournaments, declined, but, he, discovered, correspondence, chess, and, became, a, chess, journalist, writing, weekly, newspaper, columns, while, his, contemporaries, were, achieving, spectacular, success, in, the, art, world, by, selling, their, works, to, high, society, collectors, duchamp, observed, i, am, still, a, victim, of, chess, it, has, all, the, beauty, of, art, and, much, more, it, cannot, be, commercialized, chess, is, much, purer, than, art, in, its, social, position, on, another, occasion, duchamp, elaborated, the, chess, pieces, are, the, block, alphabet, which, shapes, thoughts, and, these, thoughts, although, making, a, visual, design, on, the, chess, board, express, their, beauty, abstractly, like, a, poem, i, have, come, to, the, personal, conclusion, that, while, all, artists, are, not, chess, players, all, chess, players, are, artists, in, 1932, duchamp, teamed, with, chess, theorist, vitaly, halberstadt, to, publish, l, opposition, et, cases, conjugu, es, sont, r, concili, es, opposition, and, sister, squares, are, reconciled, known, as, corresponding, squares, this, treatise, describes, the, lasker, reichhelm, position, an, extremely, rare, type, of, position, that, can, arise, in, the, endgame, using, enneagram, like, charts, that, fold, upon, themselves, the, authors, demonstrated, that, in, this, position, the, most, black, can, hope, for, is, a, draw, the, theme, of, the, endgame, is, important, to, an, understanding, of, duchamp, s, complex, attitude, toward, his, artistic, career, irish, playwright, samuel, beckett, was, an, associate, of, duchamp, and, used, the, theme, as, the, narrative, device, for, the, 1957, play, of, the, same, name, endgame, in, 1968, duchamp, played, an, artistically, important, chess, match, with, avant, garde, composer, john, cage, at, a, concert, entitled, reunion, music, was, produced, by, a, series, of, photoelectric, cells, underneath, the, chessboard, triggered, sporadically, by, normal, game, play, on, choosing, a, career, in, chess, duchamp, said, if, bobby, fischer, came, to, me, for, advice, i, certainly, would, not, discourage, him, as, if, anyone, could, but, i, would, try, to, make, it, positively, clear, that, he, will, never, have, any, money, from, chess, live, a, monk, like, existence, and, know, more, rejection, than, any, artist, ever, has, struggling, to, be, known, and, accepted, duchamp, left, a, legacy, to, chess, in, the, form, of, an, enigmatic, endgame, problem, he, composed, in, 1943, the, problem, was, included, in, the, announcement, for, julian, levi, s, gallery, exhibition, through, the, big, end, of, the, opera, glass, printed, on, translucent, paper, with, the, faint, inscription, white, to, play, and, win, grandmasters, and, endgame, specialists, have, since, grappled, with, the, problem, with, most, concluding, that, there, is, no, solution, although, duchamp, was, no, longer, considered, to, be, an, active, artist, he, continued, to, consult, with, artists, art, dealers, and, collectors, from, 1925, he, often, traveled, between, france, and, the, united, states, and, made, new, york, s, greenwich, village, his, home, in, 1942, he, also, occasionally, worked, on, artistic, projects, such, as, the, short, film, an, mic, cin, ma, 1926, box, in, a, valise, 1935, 1941, self, portrait, in, profile, 1958, and, the, larger, work, tant, donn, s, 1946, 1966, in, 1943, he, participated, with, maya, deren, in, her, unfinished, film, the, witch, s, cradle, filmed, in, peggy, guggenheim, s, art, of, this, century, gallery, from, the, mid, 1930s, onward, he, collaborated, with, the, surrealists, however, he, did, not, join, the, movement, despite, the, coaxing, of, andr, breton, from, then, until, 1944, together, with, max, ernst, eugenio, granell, and, breton, duchamp, edited, the, surrealist, periodical, vvv, and, served, as, an, advisory, editor, for, the, magazine, view, which, featured, him, in, its, march, 1945, edition, thus, introducing, him, to, a, broader, american, audience, duchamp, s, influence, on, the, art, world, remained, behind, the, scenes, until, the, late, 1950s, when, he, was, discovered, by, young, artists, such, as, robert, rauschenberg, and, jasper, johns, who, were, eager, to, escape, the, dominance, of, abstract, expressionism, he, was, a, co, founder, of, the, international, literary, group, oulipo, in, 1960, interest, in, duchamp, was, reignited, in, the, 1960s, and, he, gained, international, public, recognition, in, 1963, the, pasadena, art, museum, mounted, his, first, retrospective, exhibition, and, there, he, appeared, in, an, iconic, photograph, playing, chess, opposite, nude, model, eve, babitz, photographed, by, julian, wasser, the, photograph, was, later, described, by, the, smithsonian, archives, of, american, art, as, being, among, the, key, documentary, images, of, american, modern, art, the, tate, gallery, hosted, a, large, exhibit, of, his, work, in, 1966, other, major, institutions, including, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, and, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, followed, with, large, showings, of, duchamp, s, work, he, was, invited, to, lecture, on, art, and, to, participate, in, formal, discussions, as, well, as, sitting, for, interviews, with, major, publications, as, the, last, surviving, member, of, the, duchamp, family, of, artists, in, 1967, duchamp, helped, to, organize, an, exhibition, in, rouen, france, called, les, duchamp, jacques, villon, raymond, duchamp, villon, marcel, duchamp, suzanne, duchamp, parts, of, this, family, exhibition, were, later, shown, again, at, the, mus, e, national, d, art, moderne, in, paris, duchamp, participated, in, the, design, of, the, 1938, exposition, internationale, du, surr, alisme, held, at, the, galerie, des, beaux, arts, paris, the, show, was, organised, by, andr, breton, and, paul, luard, and, featured, two, hundred, and, twenty, nine, artworks, by, sixty, exhibitors, from, fourteen, countries, at, this, multimedia, exhibition, the, surrealists, wanted, to, create, an, exhibition, which, in, itself, would, be, a, creative, act, thus, working, collaboratively, in, its, staging, marcel, duchamp, was, named, as, generateur, arbitre, salvador, dal, and, max, ernst, were, listed, as, technical, directors, man, ray, was, chief, lighting, technician, and, wolfgang, paalen, responsible, for, water, and, foliage, plus, belles, rues, de, paris, the, most, beautiful,

suspended, from, the, ceiling, the, floor, was, covered, by, paalen, with, dead, leaves, and, mud, from, the, montparnasse, cemetery, in, the, middle, of, the, grand, hall, underneath, duchamp, s, coal, sacks, paalen, installed, an, artificial, water, filled, pond, with, real, water, lilies, and, reeds, which, he, called, avant, la, mare, a, single, light, bulb, provided, the, only, illumination, so, patrons, were, given, flashlights, with, which, to, view, the, art, an, idea, of, man, ray, while, the, aroma, of, roasting, coffee, filled, the, air, around, midnight, the, visitors, witnessed, the, dancing, shimmer, of, a, scantily, dressed, girl, who, suddenly, arose, from, the, reeds, jumped, on, a, bed, shrieked, hysterically, then, disappeared, just, as, quickly, much, to, the, surrealists, satisfaction, the, exhibition, scandalized, many, of, the, guests, in, 1942, for, the, first, papers, of, surrealism, show, in, new, york, surrealists, called, on, duchamp, to, design, the, exhibition, he, created, an, installation, his, twine, commonly, known, as, the, mile, of, string, it, was, a, three, dimensional, web, of, string, throughout, the, rooms, of, the, space, in, some, cases, making, it, almost, impossible, to, see, the, works, duchamp, made, a, secret, arrangement, with, an, associate, s, son, to, bring, young, friends, to, the, opening, of, the, show, when, the, formally, dressed, patrons, arrived, they, found, a, dozen, children, in, athletic, clothes, kicking, and, passing, balls, and, skipping, rope, when, questioned, the, children, were, told, to, say, mr, duchamp, told, us, we, could, play, here, duchamp, s, design, of, the, catalog, for, the, show, included, found, rather, than, posed, photographs, of, the, artists, breton, with, duchamp, organized, the, exhibition, le, surr, alisme, en, 1947, in, the, galerie, maeght, in, paris, after, the, war, and, named, set, designer, frederick, kiesler, as, architect, duchamp, s, final, major, art, work, surprised, the, art, world, which, believed, he, had, given, up, art, for, chess, 25, years, earlier, entitled, tant, donn, s, 1, la, chute, d, eau, 2, le, gaz, d, clairage, given,

hidden, legs, spread, and, one, hand, holding, a, gas, lamp, in, the, air, against, a, landscape, backdrop, duchamp, had, worked, secretly, on, the, piece, from, 1946, to, 1966, in, his, greenwich, village, studio, while, even, his, closest, friends, thought, he, had, abandoned, art, the, torso, of, the, nude, figure, is, based, on, duchamp, s, lover, the, brazilian, sculptor, maria, martins, with, whom, he, had, an, affair, from, 1946, to, 1951, throughout, his, adult, life, duchamp, was, a, passionate, smoker, of, habana, cigars, duchamp, became, a, united, states, citizen, in, 1955, in, june, 1927, duchamp, married, lydie, sarazin, levassor, however, they, divorced, six, months, later, it, was, rumored, that, duchamp, had, chosen, a, marriage, of, convenience, because, sarazin, levassor, was, the, daughter, of, a, wealthy, automobile, manufacturer, early, in, january, 1928, duchamp, said, that, he, could, no, longer, bear, the, responsibility, and, confinement, of, marriage, and, they, were, soon, divorced, between, 1946, and, 1951, maria, martins, was, his, mistress, in, 1954, he, and, alexina, teeny, sattler, married, they, remained, together, until, his, death,

france, with, the, epitaph, d, ailleurs, c, est, toujours, les, autres, qui, meurent, besides, it, s, always, the, others, who, die, many, critics, consider, duchamp, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, artists, of, the, 20th, century, and, his, output, influenced, the, development, of, post, world, war, i, western, art, he, advised, modern, art, collectors, such, as, peggy, guggenheim, and, other, prominent, figures, thereby, helping, to, shape, the, tastes, of, western, art, during, this, period, he, challenged, conventional, thought, about, artistic, processes, and, rejected, the,

note, in, the, letter, suggests, that, duchamp, generally, approved, of, the, statement, richter, did, not, make, the, distinction, clear, until, many, years, later, duchamp, s, attitude, was, more, favorable, however, as, evidenced, by, another, statement, made, in, 1964, pop, art, is, a, return, to, conceptual, painting, virtually, abandoned, except, by, the, surrealists, since, courbet, in,
