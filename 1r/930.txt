autocephaly, recognized, by, some, autocephalous, churches, de, jure, autocephaly, and, canonicity, recognized, by, constantinople, and, 3, other, autocephalous, churches, spiritual, independence, recognized, by, georgian, orthodox, church, semi, autonomous, gregory, of, nyssa, also, known, as, gregory, nyssen, greek, or, c, 335, c, 394, was, bishop, of, nyssa, in, cappadocia, from, 372, to, 376, and, from, 378, until, his, death, in, 394, he, is, venerated, as, a, saint, in, eastern, orthodoxy, catholicism, oriental, orthodoxy, anglicanism, and, lutheranism, gregory, his, elder, brother, basil, of, caesarea, and, their, friend, gregory, of, nazianzus, are, collectively, known, as, the, cappadocian, fathers, gregory, lacked, the, administrative, ability, of, his, brother, basil, or, the, contemporary, influence, of, gregory, of, nazianzus, but, he, was, an, erudite, christian, theologian, who, made, significant, contributions, to, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, and, the, nicene, creed, gregory, s, philosophical, writings, were, influenced, by, origen, since, the, mid, twentieth, century, there, has, been, a, significant, increase, in, interest, in, gregory, s, works, from, the, academic, community, particularly, involving, universal, salvation, which, has, resulted, in, challenges, to, many, traditional, interpretations, of, his, theology, the, book, of, acts, depicts, that, on, the, day, of, pentecost, there, were, visiting, jews, who, were, residents, of, cappadocia, in, attendance, in, the, first, epistle, of, peter, written, after, ad, 65, the, author, greets, christians, who, are, exiles, scattered, throughout, cappadocia, there, is, no, further, reference, to, cappadocia, in, the, rest, of, the, new, testament, early, christianity, arose, in, cappadocia, relatively, late, with, no, evidence, of, a, christian, community, before, the, late, second, century, ad, alexander, of, jerusalem, was, the, first, bishop, of, the, province, in, the, early, to, mid, third, century, a, period, in, which, christians, suffered, persecution, from, the, local, roman, authorities, the, community, remained, very, small, throughout, the, third, century, when, gregory, thaumaturgus, acceded, to, the, bishopric, in, c, 250, according, to, his, namesake, the, nyssen, there, were, only, seventeen, members, of, the, church, in, caesarea, cappadocian, bishops, were, among, those, at, the, first, council, of, nicaea, because, of, the, broad, distribution, of, the, population, rural, bishops, were, appointed, to, support, the, bishop, of, caesarea, during, the, late, fourth, century, there, were, around, 50, of, them, in, gregory, s, lifetime, the, christians, of, cappadocia, were, devout, with, the, veneration, of, the, forty, martyrs, of, sebaste, and, saint, george, being, particularly, significant, and, represented, by, a, considerable, monastic, presence, there, were, some, adherents, of, heretical, branches, of, christianity, most, notably, arians, encratites, and, messalians, gregory, was, born, around, 335, probably, in, or, near, the, city, of, neocaesarea, pontus, his, family, was, aristocratic, and, christian, according, to, gregory, of, nazianzus, his, mother, was, emmelia, of, caesarea, and, his, father, a, rhetorician, has, been, identified, either, as, basil, the, elder, or, as, a, gregory, among, his, eight, siblings, were, st, macrina, the, younger, st, naucratius, st, peter, of, sebaste, and, st, basil, of, caesarea, the, precise, number, of, children, in, the, family, was, historically, contentious, the, commentary, on, 30, may, in, the, acta, sanctorum, for, example, initially, states, that, they, were, nine, before, describing, peter, as, the, tenth, child, it, has, been, established, that, this, confusion, occurred, due, to, the, death, of, one, son, in, infancy, leading, to, ambiguities, in, gregory, s, own, writings, gregory, s, parents, had, suffered, persecution, for, their, faith, he, writes, that, they, had, their, goods, confiscated, for, confessing, christ, gregory, s, paternal, grandmother, macrina, the, elder, is, also, revered, as, a, saint, and, his, maternal, grandfather, was, a, martyr, as, gregory, put, it, killed, by, imperial, wrath, under, the, persecution, of, the, roman, emperor, maximinus, ii, between, the, 320s, to, the, early, 340s, the, family, rebuilt, its, fortunes, with, gregory, s, father, working, in, the, city, of, neocaesarea, as, an, advocate, and, rhetorician, gregory, s, temperament, is, said, to, have, been, quiet, and, meek, in, contrast, to, his, brother, basil, who, was, known, to, be, much, more, outspoken, gregory, was, first, educated, at, home, by, his, mother, emmelia, and, sister, macrina, little, is, known, of, what, further, education, he, received, apocryphal, hagiographies, depict, him, studying, at, athens, but, this, is, speculation, probably, based, on, the, life, of, his, brother, basil, it, seems, more, likely, that, he, continued, his, studies, in, caesarea, where, he, read, classical, literature, philosophy, and, perhaps, medicine, gregory, himself, claimed, that, his, only, teachers, were, basil, paul, john, and, the, rest, of, the, apostles, and, prophets, while, his, brothers, basil, and, naucratius, lived, as, hermits, from, c, 355, gregory, initially, pursued, a, non, ecclesiastical, career, as, a, rhetorician, he, did, however, act, as, a, lector, he, is, known, to, have, married, a, woman, named, theosebia, during, this, period, who, is, sometimes, identified, with, theosebia, the, deaconess, venerated, as, a, saint, by, orthodox, christianity, this, is, controversial, however, and, other, commentators, suggest, that, theosebia, the, deaconess, was, one, of, gregory, s, sisters, in, 371, the, emperor, valens, split, cappadocia, into, two, new, provinces, cappadocia, prima, and, cappadocia, secunda, this, resulted, in, complex, changes, in, ecclesiastical, boundaries, during, which, several, new, bishoprics, were, created, gregory, was, elected, bishop, of, the, new, see, of, nyssa, in, 372, presumably, with, the, support, of, his, brother, basil, who, was, metropolitan, of, caesarea, gregory, s, early, policies, as, bishop, often, went, against, those, of, basil, for, instance, while, his, brother, condemned, the, sabellianist, followers, of, marcellus, of, ancyra, as, heretics, gregory, may, have, tried, to, reconcile, them, with, the, church, gregory, faced, opposition, to, his, reign, in, nyssa, and, in, 373, amphilochius, bishop, of, iconium, had, to, visit, the, city, to, quell, discontent, in, 375, desmothenes, of, pontus, convened, a, synod, at, ancyra, to, try, gregory, on, charges, of, embezzlement, of, church, funds, and, irregular, ordination, of, bishops, he, was, arrested, by, imperial, troops, in, the, winter, of, the, same, year, but, escaped, to, an, unknown, location, the, synod, of, nyssa, which, was, convened, in, the, spring, of, 376, deposed, him, however, gregory, regained, his, see, in, 378, perhaps, due, to, an, amnesty, promulgated, by, the, new, emperor, gratian, in, the, same, year, basil, died, and, despite, the, relative, unimportance, of, nyssa, gregory, took, over, many, of, his, brother, s, former, responsibilities, in, pontus, he, was, present, at, the, synod, of, antioch, in, april, 379, where, he, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, reconcile, the, followers, of, meletius, of, antioch, with, those, of, paulinus, after, visiting, the, village, of, annisa, to, see, his, dying, sister, macrina, he, returned, to, nyssa, in, august, in, 380, he, travelled, to, sebaste, in, the, province, of, armenia, prima, to, support, a, pro, nicene, candidate, for, the, election, to, the, bishopric, to, his, surprise, he, himself, was, elected, to, the, seat, perhaps, due, to, the, population, s, association, of, him, with, his, brother, however, gregory, deeply, disliked, the, relatively, unhellenized, society, of, armenia, and, he, was, confronted, by, an, investigation, into, his, orthodoxy, by, local, opponents, of, the, nicene, theology, after, a, stay, of, several, months, a, substitute, was, found, possibly, gregory, s, brother, peter, who, was, bishop, of, sebaste, from, 381, and, gregory, returned, home, to, nyssa, to, write, books, i, and, ii, of, against, eunomius, gregory, participated, in, the, first, council, of, constantinople, 381, and, perhaps, gave, there, his, famous, sermon, in, suam, ordinationem, he, was, chosen, to, eulogise, at, the, funeral, of, meletius, which, occurred, during, the, council, the, council, sent, gregory, on, a, mission, to, arabia, perhaps, to, ameliorate, the, situation, in, bostra, where, two, men, agapius, and, badagius, claimed, to, be, bishop, if, this, is, the, case, gregory, was, unsuccessful, as, the, see, was, still, contested, in, 394, he, then, travelled, to, jerusalem, where, cyril, of, jerusalem, faced, opposition, from, local, clergy, due, to, the, fact, that, he, had, been, ordained, by, acacius, of, caesarea, an, arian, heretic, gregory, s, attempted, mediation, of, the, dispute, was, unsuccessful, and, he, himself, was, accused, of, holding, unorthodox, views, on, the, nature, of, christ, his, later, reign, in, nyssa, was, marked, by, conflict, with, his, metropolitan, helladius, gregory, was, present, at, a, 394, synod, convened, at, constantinople, to, discuss, the, continued, problems, in, bostra, while, the, year, of, his, death, is, unknown, it, is, generally, accepted, that, he, died, in, 394, the, traditional, view, of, gregory, is, that, he, was, an, orthodox, trinitarian, theologian, who, was, influenced, by, the, neoplatonism, of, plotinus, and, believed, in, universal, salvation, following, origen, however, as, a, highly, original, and, sophisticated, thinker, gregory, is, difficult, to, classify, and, many, aspects, of, his, theology, are, contentious, among, both, conservative, eastern, orthodox, theologians, and, western, academic, scholarship, this, is, often, due, to, the, lack, of, systematic, structure, and, the, presence, of, terminological, inconsistencies, in, gregory, s, work, gregory, following, basil, defined, the, trinity, as, one, essence, in, three, persons, the, formula, adopted, by, the, council, of, constantinople, in, 381, like, the, other, cappadocian, fathers, he, was, a, homoousian, and, against, eunomius, affirms, the, truth, of, the, consubstantiality, of, the, trinity, over, eunomius, aristotelian, belief, that, the, father, s, substance, is, unengendered, whereas, the, son, s, is, engendered, according, to, gregory, the, differences, between, the, three, persons, of, the, trinity, reside, in, their, differing, hypostatic, origin, and, the, triune, nature, of, god, is, revealed, through, divine, action, despite, the, unity, of, god, in, his, action, the, son, is, therefore, defined, as, begotten, of, the, father, the, holy, spirit, as, proceeding, from, the, father, and, the, father, by, his, role, as, progenitor, however, this, doctrine, would, seem, to, subordinate, the, son, to, the, father, and, the, holy, spirit, to, the, son, robert, jenson, suggests, that, gregory, implies, that, each, member, of, the, godhead, has, an, individual, priority, the, son, has, epistemological, priority, the, father, has, ontic, priority, and, the, spirit, has, metaphysical, priority, other, commentators, disagree, morwenna, ludlow, for, instance, argues, that, epistemic, priority, resides, primarily, in, the, spirit, in, gregory, s, theology, modern, proponents, of, social, trinitarianism, often, claim, to, have, been, influenced, by, the, cappadocians, dynamic, picture, of, the, trinity, however, it, would, be, fundamentally, incorrect, to, identify, gregory, as, a, social, trinitarian, as, his, theology, emphasises, the, unity, of, god, s, will, and, he, clearly, believes, that, the, identities, of, the, trinity, are, the, three, persons, not, the, relations, between, them, gregory, was, one, of, the, first, theologians, to, argue, that, god, is, infinite, his, main, argument, for, the, infinity, of, god, found, in, against, eunomius, is, that, god, s, goodness, is, limitless, and, as, god, s, goodness, is, essential, god, is, also, limitless, an, important, consequence, of, gregory, s, belief, in, the, infinity, of, god, is, his, belief, that, god, as, limitless, is, essentially, incomprehensible, to, the, limited, minds, of, created, beings, in, life, of, moses, gregory, writes, every, concept, that, comes, from, some, comprehensible, image, by, an, approximate, understanding, and, by, guessing, at, the, divine, nature, constitutes, an, idol, of, god, and, does, not, proclaim, god, gregory, s, theology, was, thus, apophatic, he, proposed, that, god, should, be, defined, in, terms, of, what, we, know, he, is, not, rather, than, what, we, might, speculate, him, to, be, accordingly, the, nyssen, taught, that, due, to, god, s, infinitude, a, created, being, can, never, reach, an, understanding, of, god, and, thus, for, man, in, both, life, and, the, afterlife, there, is, a, constant, progression, towards, the, unreachable, knowledge, of, god, as, the, individual, continually, transcends, all, which, has, been, reached, before, in, the, life, of, moses, gregory, speaks, of, three, stages, of, this, spiritual, growth, initial, darkness, of, ignorance, then, spiritual, illumination, and, finally, a, darkness, of, the, mind, in, mystic, contemplation, of, the, god, who, cannot, be, comprehended, gregory, was, one, of, the, earlier, proponents, of, christian, universalism, gregory, argues, that, when, paul, says, that, god, will, be, all, in, all, 1, cor, 15, 28, this, means, that, though, some, may, need, to, undergo, a, long, period, of, purification, eventually, no, being, will, remain, outside, the, number, of, the, saved, and, that, no, being, created, by, god, will, fall, outside, the, kingdom, of, god, due, to, the, unity, of, human, nature, in, christ, all, thanks, to, the, union, with, one, another, will, be, joined, in, communion, with, the, good, in, jesus, christ, our, lord, christ, s, incarnation, death, and, resurrection, results, in, total, salvation, for, human, nature, gregory, also, described, god, s, work, this, way, his, end, is, one, and, one, only, it, is, this, when, the, complete, whole, of, our, race, shall, have, been, perfected, from, the, first, man, to, the, last, some, having, at, once, in, this, life, been, cleansed, from, evil, others, having, afterwards, in, the, necessary, periods, been, healed, by, the, fire, others, having, in, their, life, here, been, unconscious, equally, of, good, and, of, evil, to, offer, to, every, one, of, us, participation, in, the, blessings, which, are, in, him, which, the, scripture, tells, us, eye, hath, not, seen, nor, ear, heard, nor, thought, ever, reached, that, this, is, what, gregory, believed, and, taught, is, affirmed, by, most, scholars, a, minority, of, scholars, have, argued, that, gregory, only, affirmed, the, universal, resurrection, in, the, life, of, moses, gregory, writes, that, just, as, the, darkness, left, the, egyptians, after, three, days, perhaps, redemption, will, be, extended, to, those, suffering, in, hell, this, salvation, may, not, only, extend, to, humans, following, origen, there, are, passages, where, he, seems, to, suggest, albeit, through, the, voice, of, macrina, that, even, the, demons, will, have, a, place, in, christ, s, world, of, goodness, gregory, s, interpretations, of, 1, corinthians, 15, 28, and, when, all, things, shall, be, subdued, unto, him, and, philippians, 2, 10, that, at, the, name, of, jesus, every, knee, should, bow, of, things, in, heaven, and, things, in, earth, and, things, under, the, earth, support, this, understanding, of, his, theology, nevertheless, in, the, great, catechism, gregory, suggests, that, while, every, human, will, be, resurrected, salvation, will, only, be, accorded, to, the, baptised, although, he, also, states, that, others, driven, by, their, passions, can, be, saved, after, being, purified, by, fire, while, he, believes, that, there, will, be, no, more, evil, in, the, hereafter, it, is, arguable, that, this, does, not, preclude, a, belief, that, god, might, justly, damn, sinners, for, eternity, thus, the, main, difference, between, gregory, s, conception, of, and, that, of, origen, would, be, that, gregory, believes, that, mankind, will, be, collectively, returned, to, sinlessness, whereas, origen, believes, that, personal, salvation, will, be, universal, this, interpretation, of, gregory, has, been, criticized, recently, however, after, all, at, the, end, of, chapter, xxxv, of, the, great, catechism, gregory, writes, that, those, who, have, not, been, purified, by, water, through, baptism, must, needs, be, purified, by, fire, so, that, after, long, succeeding, ages, their, nature, may, be, restored, pure, again, to, god, attempting, to, reconcile, these, disparate, positions, eastern, orthodox, theologian, dr, mario, baghos, notes, that, when, taken, at, face, value, the, saint, seems, to, be, contradicting, himself, in, these, passages, on, the, one, hand, he, asserted, the, salvation, of, all, and, the, complete, eradication, of, evil, and, on, the, other, that, the, fire, needed, to, purge, evil, is, sleepless, i, e, everlasting, the, only, solution, to, this, inconsistency, is, to, view, any, allusion, to, universal, salvation, in, st, gregory, as, an, expression, of, god, s, intention, for, humanity, which, is, in, fact, attested, to, when, his, holy, sister, states, that, god, has, one, goal, some, straightway, even, in, this, life, purified, from, evil, others, healed, hereafter, through, fire, for, the, appropriate, length, of, time, that, we, can, choose, either, to, accept, or, ignore, this, purification, is, confirmed, by, the, saint, s, many, exhortations, that, we, freely, undertake, the, virtuous, path, dr, ilaria, ramelli, has, made, the, observation, that, for, gregory, free, will, was, compatible, with, universal, salvation, since, every, person, would, eventually, accept, the, good, having, gone, through, purification, nevertheless, some, interpret, gregory, as, conceding, that, judas, and, similar, sinners, will, never, be, completely, purified, when, he, wrote, that, which, never, existed, is, to, be, preferred, to, that, which, has, existed, in, such, sin, for, as, to, the, latter, on, account, of, the, depth, of, the, ingrained, evil, the, chastisement, in, the, way, of, purgation, will, be, extended, into, infinity, however, ramelli, renders, the, original, greek, as, the, punishment, provided, for, the, purpose, of, purification, will, tend, to, an, indefinite, duration, additional, sources, are, needed, to, interpret, correctly, the, questioned, chapter, gregory, s, anthropology, is, founded, on, the, ontological, distinction, between, the, created, and, uncreated, man, is, a, material, creation, and, thus, limited, but, infinite, in, that, his, immortal, soul, has, an, indefinite, capacity, to, grow, closer, to, the, divine, gregory, believed, that, the, soul, is, created, simultaneous, to, the, creation, of, the, body, in, opposition, to, origen, who, believed, in, preexistence, and, that, embryos, were, thus, persons, to, gregory, the, human, being, is, exceptional, being, created, in, the, image, of, god, humanity, is, theomorphic, both, in, having, self, awareness, and, free, will, the, latter, which, gives, each, individual, existential, power, because, to, gregory, in, disregarding, god, one, negates, one, s, own, existence, in, the, song, of, songs, gregory, metaphorically, describes, human, lives, as, paintings, created, by, apprentices, to, a, master, the, apprentices, the, human, wills, imitate, their, master, s, work, the, life, of, christ, with, beautiful, colors, virtues, and, thus, man, strives, to, be, a, reflection, of, christ, gregory, in, stark, contrast, to, most, thinkers, of, his, age, saw, great, beauty, in, the, fall, from, adam, s, sin, from, two, perfect, humans, would, eventually, arise, myriad, gregory, was, the, first, voice, in, the, ancient, world, known, to, write, against, all, forms, of, slavery, declaring, the, institution, inherently, sinful, if, is, in, the, likeness, of, god, who, is, his, buyer, tell, me, who, is, his, seller, to, god, alone, belongs, this, power, or, rather, not, even, to, god, himself, god, would, not, therefore, reduce, the, human, race, to, slavery, since, himself, when, we, had, been, enslaved, to, sin, spontaneously, recalled, us, to, freedom, but, if, god, does, not, enslave, what, is, free, who, is, he, that, sets, his, own, power, above, god, s, gregory, used, plato, s, definition, of, virtue, as, something, that, admits, of, no, master, in, the, service, of, his, own, theological, arguments, against, slavery, 1, each, human, is, an, image, of, god, and, therefore, free, 2, the, equality, of, all, humans, reflects, the, equality, of, the, divine, persons, and, 3, just, as, the, divine, nature, cannot, be, divided, into, slavery, and, mastery, neither, can, human, nature, the, whole, creation, is, a, slave, but, of, god, alone, although, the, stoic, seneca, had, criticized, cruel, slave, masters, and, advised, slave, masters, to, treat, slaves, with, kindness, or, at, least, those, of, good, character, the, stoics, never, questioned, the, institution, of, slavery, which, was, considered, an, ordinary, part, of, daily, life, in, the, ancient, world, and, other, ancient, philosophers, such, as, plato, and, aristotle, also, supported, slavery, gregory, of, nyssa, s, critique, was, the, first, and, only, sustained, critique, of, the, institution, of, slavery, itself, made, in, the, ancient, world, there, are, many, similarities, between, gregory, s, theology, and, neoplatonist, philosophy, especially, that, of, plotinus, specifically, they, share, the, idea, that, the, reality, of, god, is, completely, inaccessible, to, human, beings, and, that, man, can, only, come, to, see, god, through, a, spiritual, journey, in, which, knowledge, is, rejected, in, favour, of, meditation, gregory, does, not, refer, to, any, neoplatonist, philosophers, in, his, work, and, there, is, only, one, disputed, passage, which, may, directly, quote, plotinus, considering, this, it, seems, possible, that, gregory, was, familiar, with, plotinus, and, perhaps, other, figures, in, neoplatonism, however, some, significant, differences, between, neoplatonism, and, gregory, s, thought, exist, such, as, gregory, s, statement, that, beauty, and, goodness, are, equivalent, which, contrasts, with, plotinus, view, that, they, are, two, different, qualities, however, plotinus, does, say, and, beauty, this, beauty, which, is, also, the, good, implying, the, platonist, one, which, is, the, good, is, also, beauty, eastern, orthodox, theologians, are, generally, critical, of, the, theory, that, gregory, was, influenced, by, neoplatonism, for, example, metropolitan, hierotheos, of, nafpaktos, argues, in, life, after, death, that, gregory, opposed, all, philosophical, as, opposed, to, theological, endeavour, as, tainted, with, worldliness, this, view, is, supported, by, against, eunomius, where, gregory, denounces, eunomius, for, placing, the, results, of, his, systematic, aristotelean, philosophy, above, the, traditional, teachings, of, the, church, the, eastern, orthodox, and, eastern, catholic, churches, commemorate, gregory, of, nyssa, on, 10, january, the, roman, martyrology, and, the, episcopal, church, commemorate, his, death, on, 9, march, in, modern, roman, catholic, calendars, which, include, the, feast, of, st, gregory, such, as, the, benedictines, his, feast, day, is, observed, on, 10, january, the, lutheran, church, missouri, synod, commemorates, gregory, along, with, the, other, cappadocian, fathers, on, 10, january, gregory, is, remembered, with, macrina, in, the, church, of, england, with, a, lesser, festival, on, 19, july, gregory, is, revered, as, a, saint, however, unlike, the, other, cappadocian, fathers, he, is, not, a, doctor, of, the, church, he, is, venerated, chiefly, in, the, east, his, relics, were, held, by, the, vatican, until, 2000, when, a, portion, of, them, were, translated, to, the, greek, orthodox, church, of, st, gregory, of, nyssa, san, diego, california, professor, of, theology, natalie, carnes, wrote, one, reason, gregory, was, not, taken, up, into, the, theological, stream, in, the, west, is, that, he, was, little, translated, into, latin, john, scotus, eriugena, c, 800, c, 877, should, be, greatly, credited, for, the, influence, gregory, did, have, not, only, was, eriugena, himself, influenced, by, gregory, but, he, also, translated, on, the, making, of, the, human, into, latin, gregory, s, work, received, little, scholarly, attention, in, the, west, until, the, mid, twentieth, century, and, he, was, historically, treated, as, a, minor, figure, in, comparison, to, basil, the, great, or, gregory, of, nazianzus,
