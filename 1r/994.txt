also, claimed, that, during, this, period, she, encountered, a, group, of, spiritual, adepts, the, masters, of, the, ancient, wisdom, who, sent, her, to, shigatse, tibet, where, they, trained, her, to, develop, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, synthesis, of, religion, philosophy, and, science, both, contemporary, critics, and, later, biographers, have, argued, that, some, or, all, of, these,

that, it, was, reviving, an, ancient, wisdom, which, underlay, all, the, world, s, religions, in, 1880, she, and, olcott, moved, to, india, where, the, society, was, allied, to, the, arya, samaj, a, hindu, reform, movement, that, same, year, while, in, ceylon, she, and, olcott, became, the, first, people, from, the, united, states, to, formally, convert, to, buddhism, although, opposed, by, the,

of, blavatsky, s, life, has, proved, difficult, for, biographers, because, in, later, life, she, deliberately, provided, contradictory, accounts, and, falsifications, about, her, own, past, furthermore, very, few, of, her, own, writings, written, before, 1873, survive, meaning, that, biographers, must, rely, heavily, on, these, unreliable, later, accounts, the, accounts, of, her, early,

experience, visions, in, which, she, encountered, a, mysterious, indian, man, and, that, in, later, life, she, would, meet, this, man, in, the, flesh, many, biographers, have, considered, this, to, be, the, first, appearance, of, the, masters, in, her, life, story, according, to, some, of, her, later, accounts, in, 1844, 45, blavatsky, was, taken, by, her, father, to, england, where, she, visited, london, and, bath, according, to, this, story, in, london, she, received, piano, lessons, from, the, bohemian, composer, ignaz, moscheles, and, performed, with, clara, schumann, however, some, blavatsky, biographers, believe, that, this, visit, to, britain, never, took, place, particularly, as, no, mention, of, it, is, made, in, her, sister, s, memoirs, after, a, year, spent, living, with, her, aunt, yekaterina, andreyevna, witte, mother, of, the, future, first, prime, minister, of, the, russian, empire, sergei, witte, she, moved, to, tiflis, georgia, where, her, grandfather,

freemason, and, member, of, the, golitsyn, family, who, encouraged, her, interest, in, esoteric, matters, she, would, also, claim, that, at, this, period, she, had, further, paranormal, experiences, astral, traveling, and, again, encountering, her, mysterious, indian, in, visions, at, age, 17, she, agreed, to, marry, nikifor, vladimirovich, blavatsky, a, man, in, his, forties, who, worked, as, vice, governor, of, erivan, province, her, reasons, for, doing, so, were, unclear, although, she, later, claimed, that, she, was, attracted, by, his, belief, in, magic, although, she, tried, to, back, out, shortly, before, the, wedding, ceremony, the, marriage, took, place, on, 7, july, 1849, moving, with, him, to, the, sardar, palace, she, made, repeated, unsuccessful, attempts, to, escape, and,

to, saint, petersburg, with, her, the, escorts, accompanied, her, to, poti, and, then, kerch, intending, to, continue, with, her, to, odessa, blavatsky, claimed, that, fleeing, her, escorts, and,

her, father, she, did, not, keep, a, diary, at, the, time, and, was, not, accompanied, by, relatives, who, could, verify, her, activities, thus, historian, of, esotericism, nicholas, goodrick, clarke, noted, that, public, knowledge, of, these, travels, rests, upon, her, own, largely, uncorroborated, accounts, which, are, marred, by, being, occasionally, conflicting, in, their, chronology, for, religious, studies, scholar, bruce, f, campbell, there, was, no, reliable, account, for, the, next, 25, years, of, her, life, according, to, biographer, peter, washington, at, this, point, myth, and, reality, begin, to, merge, seamlessly, in, blavatsky, s, biography, she, later, claimed, that, in, constantinople, she, developed, a, friendship, with, a, hungarian, opera, singer, named, agardi, metrovitch, whom, she, first, encountered, when, saving, him, from, being, murdered, it, was, also, in, constantinople, that, she, met, the, countess, sofia, kiselyova, who, she, would, accompany, on, a, tour, of, egypt, greece, and, eastern, europe, in, cairo, she, met, the, american, art, student, albert, rawson, who, later, wrote, extensively, about, the, middle, east, and, together, they,

england, and, would, claim, that, it, was, here, that, she, met, the, mysterious, indian, who, had, appeared, in, her, childhood, visions, a, hindu, whom, she, referred, to, as, the, master, morya, while, she, provided, various, conflicting, accounts, of, how, they, met, locating, it, in, both, london, and, ramsgate, according, to, separate, stories, she, maintained, that, he, claimed, that, he, had, a, special, mission, for, her, and, that, she, must, travel, to, tibet, she, made, her, way, to, asia, via, the, americas, heading, to, canada, in, autumn, 1851, inspired, by, the, novels, of, james, fenimore, cooper, she, sought, out, the, native, american, communities, of, quebec, in, the, hope, of, meeting, their, magico, religious, specialists, but, was, instead, robbed, later,

via, ship, from, the, west, indies, to, ceylon, and, then, bombay, she, spent, two, years, in, india, allegedly, following, the, instructions, found, in, letters, that, morya, had, sent, to, her, she, attempted, to, enter, tibet, but, was, prevented, from, doing, so, by, the, british, colonial, administration, she, later, claimed, that, she, then, headed, back, to, europe, by, ship, surviving, a, shipwreck, near, to, the, cape, of, good, hope, before, arriving, in, england, in, 1854, where, she, faced, hostility, as, a, russian, citizen, due, to, the, ongoing, crimean, war, between, britain, and, russia, it, was, here, she, claimed, that, she, worked, as, a, concert, musician, for, the, royal, philharmonic, society, sailing, to, the, u, s, she, visited, new, york, city, where, she, met, up, with, rawson, before, touring, chicago, salt, lake, city, and, san, francisco, and, then, sailing, back, to, india, via, japan, there, she, spent, time, in, kashmir, ladakh, and, burma, before, making, a, second, attempt, to, enter, tibet, she, claimed, that, this, time, she, was, successful, entering, tibet, in, 1856, through, kashmir, accompanied, by, a, tartar, shaman, who, was, attempting, to, reach, siberia, and, who, thought, that, as, a, russian, citizen, blavatsky, would, be, able, to, aid, him, in, doing, so, according, to, this, account, they, reached, leh, before, becoming, lost, eventually, joining, a, traveling, tartar, group, before, she, headed, back, to, india, she, returned, to, europe, via, madras, and, java, after, spending, time, in, france, and,

accompanying, her, around, the, house, and, furniture, moving, of, its, own, volition, in, 1860, she, and, her, sister, visited, their, maternal, grandmother, in, tiflis, it, was, there, that, she, met, up, with, metrovitch, and, where, she, reconciled, with, nikifor, in, 1862, together, they, adopted, a, child, named, yuri, who, would, die, aged, five, in, 1867, when, he, was, buried, under, metrovitch, s, surname, in, 1864, while, riding, in, mingrelia, blavatsky, fell, from, her, horse, and, was, in, a, coma, for, several, months, with, a, spinal, fracture, recovering, in, tiflis, she, claimed, that, upon, awaking, she, gained, full, control, of, her, paranormal, abilities, she, then, proceeded, to, italy, transylvania, and, serbia, possibly, studying, the, cabalah, with, a, rabbi, at, this, point, in, 1867, she, proceeded, to, the, balkans, hungary, and, then, italy, where, she, spent, time, in, venice, florence, and, mentana, claiming, that, in, the, latter, she, had, been, injured, fighting, for, giuseppe, garibaldi, at, the, battle, of, mentana, she, claimed, to, have, then, received, a, message, from, morya, to, travel, to, constantinople, where, he, met, her, and, together, they, traveled, overland, to, tibet, going, through, turkey, persia, afghanistan, and, then, into, india, entering, tibet, via, kashmir, there, they, allegedly, stayed, in, the, home, of, morya, s, friend, and, colleague, master, koot, hoomi, which, was, near, to, tashilhunpo, monastery, shigatse, according, to, blavatsky, both, morya, and, koot, hoomi, were, kashmiris, of, punjabi, origin, and, it, was, at, his, home, that, koot, hoomi, taught, students, of, the, gelugpa, sect, of, tibetan, buddhism, koot, hoomi, was, described, as, having, spent, time, in, london, and, leipzig, being, fluent, in, both, english, and, french, and, like, morya, was, a, vegetarian, she, claimed, that, in, tibet, she, was, taught, an, ancient, unknown, language, known, as, senzar, and, translated, a, number, of, ancient, texts, written, in, this, language, that, were, preserved, by, the, monks, of, a, monastery, she, stated, that, she, was, however, not, permitted, entry, into, the, monastery, itself, she, also, claimed, that, while, in, tibet, morya, and, koot, hoomi, helped, her, develop, and, control, her, psychic, powers, among, the, abilities, that, she, ascribed, to, these, masters, were, clairvoyance, clairaudience, telepathy, and, the, ability, to, control, another, s, consciousness, to, dematerialize, and, rematerialize, physical, objects, and, to, project, their, astral, bodies, thus, giving, the, appearance, of, being, in, two, places, at, once, she, claimed, to, have, remained, on, this, spiritual, retreat, from, late, 1868, until, late, 1870, blavatsky, never, claimed, in, print, to, have, visited, lhasa, although, this, is, a, claim, that, would, be, made, for, her, in, various, later, sources, including, the, account, provided, by, her, sister, many, critics, and, biographers, have, expressed, doubt, about, the, veracity, of, blavatsky, s, claims, regarding, her, visits, to, tibet, which, rely, entirely, on, her, own, claims, lacking, any, credible, independent, testimony, it, has, been, highlighted, that, during, the, nineteenth, century, tibet, was, closed, to, europeans, and, visitors, faced, the, perils, of, bandits, and, a, harsh, terrain, the, latter, would, have, been, even, more, problematic, if, blavatsky, had, been, as, stout, and, unathletic, as, she, would, be, in, later, life, however, as, several, biographers, have, noted, traders, and, pilgrims, from, neighboring, lands, were, able, to, access, tibet, freely, suggesting, the, possibility, that, she, would, have, been, allowed, to, enter, accompanied, by, morya, particularly, if, she, had, been, mistaken, for, an, asian, blavatsky, s, eyewitness, account, of, shigatse, was, unprecedented, in, the, west, and, one, scholar, of, buddhism, d, t, suzuki, suggested, that, she, later, exhibited, an, advanced, knowledge, of, mahayana, buddhism, consistent, with, her, having, studied, in, a, tibetan, monastery, lachman, noted, that, had, blavatsky, spent, time, in, tibet, then, she, would, be, one, of, the, greatest, travelers, of, the, nineteenth, century, although, he, added, in, all, honesty, i, do, not, know, if, blavatsky, spent, time, in, tibet, or, not, biographer, marion, meade, commented, on, blavatsky, s, tales, of, tibet, and, various, other, adventures, by, stating, that, hardly, a, word, of, this, appears, to, be, true, blavatsky, alleged, that, she, departed, tibet, with, the, mission, of, proving, to, the, world, that, the, phenomena, identified, by, spiritualists, were, objectively, real, thus, defending, spiritualism, against, accusations, of, fraud, however, she, also, stated, that, the, entities, being, contacted, by, spiritualist, mediums, were, not, the, spirits, of, the, dead, as, the, spiritualist, movement, typically, alleged, but, instead, either, mischievous, elementals, or, the, shells, left, behind, by, the, deceased, she, proceeded, via, the, suez, canal, to, greece, where, she, met, with, another, of, the, masters, master, hilarion, she, set, sail, for, egypt, aboard, the, ss, eunomia, but, in, july, 1871, it, exploded, during, the, journey, blavatsky, was, one, of, only, 16, survivors, reaching, cairo, she, met, up, with, metamon, and, with, the, help, of, a, woman, named, emma, cutting, established, a, soci, t, spirite, which, was, based, largely, on, spiritism, a, form, of, spiritualism, founded, by, allan, kardec, which, professed, a, belief, in, reincarnation, in, contrast, to, the, mainstream, spiritualist, movement, however, blavatsky, believed, that, cutting, and, many, of, the, mediums, employed, by, the, society, were, fraudulent, and, she, closed, it, down, after, two, weeks, in, cairo, she, also, met, with, the, egyptologist, gaston, maspero, and, another, of, the, masters, serapis, bey, it, was, also, here, that, she, met, up, with, metrovitch, although, he, soon, died, of, typhoid, with, blavatsky, claiming, to, have, overseen, the, funeral, leaving, egypt, she, proceeded, to, syria, palestine, and, lebanon, there, encountering, members, of, the, druze, religion, it, was, during, these, travels, that, she, met, with, the, writer, and, traveler, lidia, pashkova, who, provided, independent, verification, of, blavatsky, s, travels, during, this, period, in, july, 1872, she, returned, to, her, family, in, odessa, before, departing, in, april, 1873, she, spent, time, in, bucharest, and, paris, before, according, to, her, later, claims, morya, instructed, her, to, go, to, the, united, states, blavatsky, arrived, in, new, york, city, on, 8, july, 1873, there, she, moved, into, a, women, s, housing, cooperative, on, madison, street, in, manhattan, s, lower, east, side, earning, a, wage, through, piece, work, sewing, and, designing, advertising, cards, it, was, here, that, she, attracted, attention, and, was, interviewed, by, the, journalist, anna, ballard, of, the, new, york, newspaper, the, sun, this, interview, was, the, earliest, textual, source, in, which, blavatsky, claimed, to, have, spent, time, in, tibet, indeed, it, was, while, in, new, york, that, detailed, records, of, blavatsky, s, life, again, become, available, to, historians, soon, after, blavatsky, received, news, of, her, father, s, death, thus, inheriting, a, considerable, fortune, allowing, her, to, move, into, a, lavish, hotel, in, december, 1874, blavatsky, met, the, georgian, mikheil, betaneli, infatuated, with, her, he, repeatedly, requested, that, they, marry, to, which, she, ultimately, relented, this, constituted, bigamy, as, her, first, husband, was, still, alive, however, as, she, refused, to, consummate, the, marriage, betaneli, sued, for, divorce, and, returned, to, georgia, blavatsky, was, intrigued, by, a, news, story, about, william, and, horatio, eddy, brothers, based, in, chittenden, vermont, who, it, was, claimed, could, levitate, and, manifest, spiritual, phenomena, she, visited, chittenden, in, october, 1874, there, meeting, the, reporter, henry, steel, olcott, who, was, investigating, the, brothers, claims, for, the, daily, graphic, claiming, that, blavatsky, impressed, him, with, her, own, ability, to, manifest, spirit, phenomena, olcott, authored, a, newspaper, article, on, her, they, soon, became, close, friends, giving, each, other, the, nicknames, of, maloney, olcott, and, jack, blavatsky, he, helped, attract, greater, attention, to, blavatsky, s, claims, encouraging, the, daily, graphics, editor, to, publish, an, interview, with, her, and, discussing, her, in, his, book, on, spiritualism, people, from, the, other, world, 1875, which, her, russian, correspondent, alexandr, aksakov, urged, her, to, translate, into, russian, she, began, to, instruct, olcott, in, her, own, occult, beliefs, and, encouraged, by, her, he, became, celibate, tee, totaling, and, vegetarian, although, she, herself, was, unable, to, commit, to, the, latter, in, january, 1875, the, duo, visited, the, spiritualist, mediums, nelson, and, jennie, owen, in, philadelphia, the, owens, asked, olcott, to, test, them, to, prove, that, the, phenomena, that, they, produced, were, not, fraudulent, and, while, olcott, believed, them, blavatsky, opined, that, they, faked, some, of, their, phenomena, in, those, instances, when, genuine, phenomena, failed, to, manifest, drumming, up, interest, for, their, ideas, blavatsky, and, olcott, published, a, circular, letter, in, eldridge, gerry, brown, s, boston, based, spiritualist, publication, the, spiritual, scientist, there, they, named, themselves, the, brotherhood, of, luxor, a, name, potentially, inspired, by, the, pre, existing, hermetic, brotherhood, of, luxor, they, began, living, together, in, a, series, of, rented, apartments, in, new, york, city, which, they, decorated, with, taxidermied, animals, and, images, of, spiritual, figures, their, life, was, funded, largely, by, olcott, s, continued, work, as, a, lawyer, their, last, such, apartment, came, to, be, known, as, the, lamasery, allegedly, encouraged, by, the, masters, blavatsky, and, olcott, established, the, miracle, club, through, which, they, facilitated, lectures, on, esoteric, themes, in, new, york, city, it, was, through, this, group, that, they, met, an, irish, spiritualist, william, quan, judge, who, shared, many, of, their, interests, at, a, miracle, club, meeting, on, 7, september, 1875, blavatsky, olcott, and, judge, agreed, to, establish, an, esoteric, organization, with, charles, sotheran, suggesting, that, they, call, it, the, theosophical, society, the, term, theosophy, came, from, the, greek, theos, god, s, and, sophia, wisdom, thus, meaning, god, wisdom, or, divine, wisdom, the, term, was, not, new, but, had, been, previously, used, in, various, contexts, by, the, philaletheians, and, the, christian, mystic, jakob, b, hme, theosophists, would, often, argue, over, how, to, define, theosophy, with, judge, expressing, the, view, that, the, task, was, impossible, blavatsky, however, insisted, that, theosophy, was, not, a, religion, in, itself, lachman, has, described, the, movement, as, a, very, wide, umbrella, under, which, quite, a, few, things, could, find, a, place, on, foundation, olcott, was, appointed, chairman, with, judge, as, secretary, and, blavatsky, as, corresponding, secretary, although, she, remained, the, group, s, primary, theoretician, and, leading, figure, prominent, early, members, included, emma, hardinge, britten, signor, bruzzesi, c, c, massey, and, william, l, alden, many, were, prominent, and, successful, members, of, the, establishment, although, not, all, would, remain, members, for, long, the, underlying, theme, among, these, diverse, topics, is, the, existence, of, an, ancient, wisdom, religion, an, ageless, occult, guide, to, the, cosmos, nature, and, human, life, the, many, faiths, of, man, are, said, to, derive, from, a, universal, religion, known, to, both, plato, and, the, ancient, hindu, sages, the, wisdom, religion, is, also, identified, with, hermetic, philosophy, as, the, only, possible, key, to, the, absolute, in, science, and, theology, i, vii, every, religion, is, based, on, the, same, truth, or, secret, doctrine, which, contains, the, alpha, and, omega, of, universal, science, i, 511, this, ancient, wisdom, religion, will, become, the, religion, of, the, future, i, 613, historian, nicholas, goodrick, clarke, 2004, in, 1875, blavatsky, began, work, on, a, book, outlining, her, theosophical, worldview, much, of, which, would, be, written, during, a, stay, in, the, ithaca, home, of, hiram, corson, a, professor, of, english, literature, at, cornell, university, although, she, had, hoped, to, call, it, the, veil, of, isis, it, would, be, published, as, isis, unveiled, while, writing, it, blavatsky, claimed, to, be, aware, of, a, second, consciousness, within, her, body, referring, to, it, as, the, lodger, who, is, in, me, and, stating, that, it, was, this, second, consciousness, that, inspired, much, of, the, writing, in, isis, unveiled, blavatsky, quoted, extensively, from, other, esoteric, and, religious, texts, although, her, contemporary, and, colleague, olcott, always, maintained, that, she, had, quoted, from, books, that, she, did, not, have, access, to, writing, more, than, a, century, after, her, death, lachman, conjectured, that, if, this, had, been, the, case, then, she, had, had, an, eidetic, memory, such, that, while, relying, on, earlier, sources, the, book, represented, an, original, synthesis, that, connected, disparate, ideas, not, brought, together, before, revolving, around, blavatsky, s, idea, that, all, the, world, s, religions, stemmed, from, a, single, ancient, wisdom, which, she, connected, to, the, western, esotericism, of, ancient, hermeticism, and, neoplatonism, it, also, articulated, her, thoughts, on, spiritualism, and, provided, a, criticism, of, darwinian, evolution, stating, that, it, dealt, only, with, the, physical, world, and, ignored, the, spiritual, realms, the, book, was, edited, by, professor, of, philosophy, alexander, wilder, and, published, in, two, volumes, by, j, w, bouton, in, 1877, although, facing, negative, mainstream, press, reviews, including, from, those, who, highlighted, that, it, extensively, quoted, around, 100, other, books, without, acknowledgement, it, proved, to, be, such, a, commercial, success, with, its, initial, print, run, of, 1, 000, copies, selling, out, in, a, week, that, the, publisher, requested, a, sequel, although, blavatsky, turned, down, the, offer, while, isis, unveiled, was, a, success, the, society, remained, largely, inactive, having, fallen, into, this, state, in, autumn, 1876, this, was, despite, the, fact, that, new, lodges, of, the, organization, had, been, established, throughout, the, u, s, and, in, london, and, prominent, figures, like, thomas, edison, and, abner, doubleday, had, joined, in, july, 1878, blavatsky, gained, u, s, citizenship, the, theosophical, society, established, links, with, an, indian, hindu, reform, movement, the, arya, samaj, which, had, been, founded, by, the, swami, dayananda, saraswati, blavatsky, and, olcott, believed, that, the, two, organizations, shared, a, common, spiritual, world, view, unhappy, with, life, in, the, u, s, blavatsky, decided, to, move, to, india, with, olcott, agreeing, to, join, her, securing, work, as, a, u, s, trade, representative, to, the, country, in, december, the, duo, auctioned, off, many, of, their, possessions, although, edison, gifted, them, a, phonograph, to, take, with, them, to, india, they, left, new, york, city, aboard, the, canada, which, took, them, to, london, after, meeting, with, well, wishers, in, the, capital, they, traveled, to, liverpool, there, setting, sail, aboard, the, speke, hall, arriving, in, bombay, in, february, 1879, in, the, city, they, were, greeted, with, celebrations, organized, by, arya, samaj, member, hurrychund, chintamon, before, obtaining, a, house, in, girgaum, road, part, of, bombay, s, native, area, associating, largely, with, indians, rather, than, the, governing, british, elite, blavatsky, took, a, fifteen, year, old, gujarati, boy, vallah, babula, bulla, as, her, personal, servant, many, educated, indians, were, impressed, with, the, theosophists, championing, of, indian, religions, coming, about, during, a, period, of, growing, self, assertion, against, the, values, and, beliefs, of, the, british, empire, her, activity, in, the, city, was, monitored, by, british, intelligence, services, who, suspected, that, she, was, working, for, russia, in, april, blavatsky, took, olcott, babula, and, their, friend, moolji, thackersey, to, the, karla, caves, announcing, that, they, contained, secret, passages, that, led, to, an, underground, place, where, the, masters, assembled, then, claiming, that, the, masters, were, telepathically, commanding, her, to, head, to, rajputana, in, the, punjab, she, and, olcott, headed, north, at, the, yamuna, river, they, met, the, sannyasin, babu, surdass, who, had, sat, in, the, lotus, position, for, 52, years, and, in, agra, saw, the, taj, mahal, in, saharanpur, they, met, with, dayananda, and, his, arya, samajists, before, returning, to, bombay, in, july, 1879, blavatsky, and, olcott, began, work, on, a, monthly, magazine, the, theosophist, with, the, first, issue, coming, out, in, october, the, magazine, soon, obtained, a, large, readership, with, the, management, being, taken, over, by, damodar, k, mavalankar, a, theosophist, who, introduced, the, idea, of, referring, to, the, masters, as, mahatmas, in, december, blavatsky, and, olcott, traveled, to, allahabad, there, visiting, alfred, percy, sinnett, the, editor, of, the, pioneer, and, keen, spiritualist, a, o, hume, was, also, a, guest, at, the, sinnett, s, home, and, blavatsky, was, encouraged, to, manifest, paranormal, phenomena, in, their, presence, from, there, they, traveled, to, benares, where, they, stayed, at, the, palace, of, the, maharaja, of, vizianagram, blavatsky, and, olcott, were, then, invited, to, ceylon, by, buddhist, monks, there, they, officially, converted, to, buddhism, apparently, the, first, from, the, united, states, to, do, so, taking, the, five, precepts, in, a, ceremony, at, ramayana, nikayana, in, may, 1880, touring, the, island, they, were, met, by, crowds, intrigued, by, these, unusual, westerners, who, embraced, buddhism, rather, than, proselytizing, christianity, their, message, proved, a, boost, to, sinhalese, nationalist, self, esteem, and, they, were, invited, to, see, the, buddha, s, tooth, in, kandy, upon, learning, that, old, comrade, emma, coulomb, n, e, cutting, and, her, husband, had, fallen, into, poverty, in, ceylon, blavatsky, invited, them, to, move, into, her, home, in, bombay, however, the, coulombs, annoyed, rosa, bates, and, edward, winbridge, two, american, theosophists, who, were, also, living, with, blavatsky, when, blavatsky, took, the, side, of, the, coulombs, bates, and, winbridge, returned, to, the, u, s, blavatsky, was, then, invited, to, simla, to, spend, more, time, with, sinnett, and, there, performed, a, range, of, materializations, that, astounded, the, other, guests, in, one, instance, she, allegedly, made, a, cup, and, saucer, materialize, under, the, soil, during, a, picnic, sinnett, was, eager, to, contact, the, masters, himself, convincing, blavatsky, to, facilitate, this, communication, resulting, in, the, production, of, over, 1400, pages, allegedly, authored, by, koot, hoomi, and, morya, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, mahatma, letters, sinnett, summarised, the, teachings, contained, in, these, letters, in, his, book, esoteric, buddhism, 1883, although, scholars, of, buddhism, like, max, m, ller, publicly, highlighted, that, the, contents, were, not, buddhist, and, blavatsky, herself, disliked, the, misleading, title, since, the, book, s, publication, there, has, been, much, debate, as, to, the, authenticity, of, the, letters, with, some, arguing, that, they, were, written, by, blavatsky, herself, and, others, believing, that, they, were, written, by, separate, individuals, according, to, meade, there, can, be, no, reasonable, doubt, that, helena, was, their, author, theosophy, was, unpopular, with, both, christian, missionaries, and, the, british, colonial, administration, with, india, s, english, language, press, being, almost, uniformly, negative, toward, the, society, the, group, nevertheless, proved, popular, and, branches, were, established, across, the, country, while, blavatsky, had, emphasized, its, growth, among, the, native, indian, population, rather, than, among, the, british, elite, she, moved, into, a, comfortable, bungalow, in, the, elite, bombay, suburb, of, breach, candy, which, she, said, was, more, accessible, to, western, visitors, olcott, had, decided, to, establish, the, buddhist, education, fund, to, combat, the, spread, of, the, christian, faith, in, ceylon, and, encourage, pride, and, interest, in, buddhism, among, the, island, s, sinhalese, population, although, blavatsky, initially, opposed, the, idea, stating, that, the, masters, would, not, approve, olcott, s, project, proved, a, success, and, she, changed, her, opinion, about, it, blavatsky, had, been, diagnosed, with, bright, s, disease, and, hoping, the, weather, to, be, more, conducive, to, her, condition, she, took, up, the, offer, of, the, society, s, madras, branch, to, move, to, their, city, however, in, november, 1882, the, society, purchased, an, estate, in, adyar, which, became, their, permanent, headquarters, a, few, rooms, were, set, aside, for, blavatsky, who, moved, into, them, in, december, she, continued, to, tour, the, subcontinent, claiming, that, she, then, spent, time, in, sikkim, and, tibet, where, she, visited, her, teacher, s, ashram, for, several, days, with, her, health, deteriorating, she, agreed, to, accompany, olcott, on, his, trip, to, britain, where, he, was, planning, to, argue, the, case, for, ceylonese, buddhism, and, sort, out, problems, with, the, society, s, london, lodge, sailing, to, marseilles, france, in, march, 1883, she, spent, time, in, nice, with, the, founder, of, the, theosophical, society, s, french, branch, the, countess, of, caithness, widow, of, james, sinclair, 14th, earl, of, caithness, with, whom, she, continued, to, paris, in, london, she, appeared, at, the, lodge, s, meeting, where, she, sought, to, quell, arguments, between, sinnett, on, the, one, hand, and, anna, kingsford, and, edward, maitland, on, the, other, unsatisfied, kingsford, whom, blavatsky, thought, an, unbearable, snobbish, woman, split, from, the, theosophical, society, to, form, the, hermetic, society, in, london, blavatsky, made, contact, with, the, society, for, psychical, research, spr, through, frederic, w, h, myers, she, complied, with, their, request, to, undertake, a, study, of, her, and, the, paranormal, abilities, that, she, claimed, to, possess, although, wasn, t, impressed, by, the, organization, and, mockingly, referred, to, it, as, the, spookical, research, society, with, blavatsky, in, europe, trouble, broke, out, at, the, society, s, adyar, headquarters, in, what, became, known, as, the, coulomb, affair, the, society, s, board, of, control, had, accused, emma, coulomb, of, misappropriating, their, funds, for, her, own, purposes, and, asked, her, to, leave, their, center, she, and, her, husband, refused, blackmailing, the, society, with, letters, that, they, claimed, were, written, by, blavatsky, and, which, proved, that, her, paranormal, abilities, were, fraudulent, the, society, refused, to, pay, them, and, expelled, them, from, their, premises, at, which, the, couple, turned, to, the, madras, based, christian, college, magazine, who, published, an, expos, of, blavatsky, s, alleged, fraudulence, using, the, coulombs, claims, as, a, basis, the, story, attracted, international, attention, and, was, picked, up, by, london, based, newspaper, the, times, in, response, in, november, 1884, blavatsky, headed, to, cairo, where, she, and, theosophist, charles, webster, leadbeater, searched, for, negative, information, on, emma, coulomb, discovering, stories, of, her, alleged, former, history, of, extortion, and, criminality, internally, the, society, was, greatly, damaged, by, the, coulomb, affair, although, it, remained, popular, in, india, as, did, blavatsky, herself, worsening, health, led, blavatsky, to, contemplate, a, return, to, the, milder, climate, of, europe, and, resigning, her, position, as, corresponding, secretary, of, the, society, she, left, india, in, march, 1885, by, 1885, the, theosophical, society, had, experienced, rapid, growth, with, 121, lodges, having, been, chartered, across, the, world, 106, of, which, were, located, in, india, burma, and, ceylon, initially, each, lodge, was, chartered, directly, from, the, adyar, headquarters, with, members, making, democratic, decisions, by, vote, however, over, the, coming, years, the, lodges, were, organized, into, national, units, with, their, own, ruling, councils, resulting, in, tensions, between, the, different, levels, of, administration, settling, in, naples, italy, in, april, 1885, she, began, living, off, of, a, small, society, pension, and, continued, working, on, her, next, book, the, secret, doctrine, she, then, moved, to, w, rzburg, in, the, kingdom, of, bavaria, where, she, was, visited, by, a, swedish, theosophist, the, countess, constance, wachtmeister, who, became, her, constant, companion, throughout, the, rest, of, her, life, in, december, 1885, the, spr, published, their, report, on, blavatsky, and, her, alleged, phenomena, authored, by, richard, hodgson, in, his, report, hodgson, accused, blavatsky, of, being, a, spy, for, the, russian, government, further, accusing, her, of, faking, paranormal, phenomena, largely, on, the, basis, of, the, coulomb, s, claims, the, report, caused, much, tension, within, the, society, with, a, number, of, blavatsky, s, followers, among, them, babaji, and, subba, row, denouncing, her, and, resigning, from, the, organization, on, the, basis, of, it, for, our, own, part, we, regard, neither, as, the, mouthpiece, of, hidden, seers, nor, as, a, mere, vulgar, adventuress, we, think, that, she, has, achieved, a, title, to, permanent, remembrance, as, one, of, the, most, accomplished, ingenious, and, interesting, imposters, in, history, the, statement, of, the, society, for, psychical, research, on, the, basis, of, the, hodgson, report, blavatsky, wanted, to, sue, her, accusers, although, olcott, advised, against, it, believing, that, the, surrounding, publicity, would, damage, the, society, in, private, letters, blavatsky, expressed, relief, that, the, criticism, was, focused, on, her, and, that, the, identity, of, the, masters, had, not, been, publicly, exposed, for, decades, after, theosophists, criticized, hodgson, s, methodology, arguing, that, he, set, out, to, disprove, and, attack, blavatsky, rather, than, conduct, an, unbiased, analysis, of, her, claims, and, abilities, in, 1986, the, spr, admitted, this, to, be, the, case, and, retracted, the, findings, of, the, report, however, johnson, has, commented, theosophists, have, overinterpreted, this, as, complete, vindication, when, in, fact, many, questions, raised, by, hodgson, remain, unanswered, in, 1886, by, which, time, she, was, using, a, wheelchair, blavatsky, moved, to, ostend, in, belgium, where, she, was, visited, by, theosophists, from, across, europe, among, them, was, the, doctor, william, ashton, ellis, who, treated, her, during, a, near, fatal, illness, in, march, 1887, blavatsky, credited, him, with, saving, her, life, supplementing, her, pension, she, established, a, small, ink, producing, business, she, received, messages, from, members, of, the, society, s, london, lodge, who, were, dissatisfied, with, sinnett, s, running, of, it, they, believed, that, he, was, focusing, on, attaining, upper, class, support, rather, than, encouraging, the, promotion, of, theosophy, throughout, society, a, criticism, blavatsky, agreed, with, she, arrived, in, london, in, may, 1887, initially, staying, in, the, upper, norwood, home, of, theosophist, mabel, collins, in, september, she, moved, into, the, holland, park, home, of, fellow, theosophists, bertram, keightley, and, his, nephew, archibald, keightley, in, london, she, established, the, blavatsky, lodge, as, a, rival, to, that, run, by, sinnett, draining, much, of, its, membership, lodge, meetings, were, held, at, the, keightleys, house, on, thursday, nights, with, blavatsky, also, greeting, many, visitors, there, among, them, the, occultist, and, poet, w, b, yeats, in, november, 1889, she, was, visited, by, the, indian, lawyer, mohandas, gandhi, who, was, studying, the, bhagavad, gita, with, the, knightleys, he, became, an, associate, member, of, blavatsky, s, lodge, in, march, 1891, and, would, emphasize, the, close, connection, between, theosophy, and, hinduism, throughout, his, life, in, 1888, blavatsky, established, the, esoteric, section, of, the, theosophical, society, a, group, under, her, complete, control, for, which, admittance, was, restricted, to, those, who, had, passed, certain, tests, she, identified, it, as, a, place, for, true, theosophists, who, would, focus, on, the, system, s, philosophy, rather, than, experiment, with, producing, paranormal, phenomena, in, london, blavatsky, founded, a, magazine, controversially, titling, it, lucifer, in, this, theosophical, publication, she, sought, to, completely, ignore, claims, regarding, paranormal, phenomena, and, focus, instead, on, a, discussion, of, philosophical, ideas, blavatsky, also, finished, writing, the, secret, doctrine, which, was, then, edited, by, the, keightleys, as, a, commercial, publisher, willing, to, publish, the, approximately, 1, 500, page, work, could, not, be, found, blavatsky, established, the, theosophical, publishing, company, who, brought, out, the, work, in, two, volumes, the, first, published, in, october, 1888, and, the, second, in, january, 1889, blavatsky, claimed, that, the, book, constituted, her, commentary, on, the, book, of, dzyan, a, religious, text, written, in, senzar, which, she, had, been, taught, while, studying, in, tibet, buddhologist, david, reigle, claimed, that, he, identified, books, of, kiu, te, including, blavatsky, s, book, of, dzyan, as, a, first, volume, as, the, tantra, section, of, the, tibetan, buddhist, canon, however, most, scholars, of, buddhism, to, have, examined, the, secret, doctrine, have, concluded, that, there, was, no, such, text, as, the, book, of, dzyan, and, that, instead, it, was, the, fictional, creation, of, blavatsky, s, in, the, book, blavatsky, outlined, her, own, cosmogonical, ideas, about, how, the, universe, the, planets, and, the, human, species, came, to, exist, she, also, discussed, her, views, about, the, human, being, and, their, soul, thus, dealing, with, issues, surrounding, an, afterlife, the, two, volume, book, was, reviewed, for, the, pall, mall,

theosophical, society, in, besant, s, house, there, she, authored, a, book, containing, questions, and, corresponding, answers, the, key, to, theosophy, this, was, followed, by, the, voice, of, the, silence, a, short, devotional, text, which, she, claimed, was, based, on, a, senzar, text, known, as, the, book, of, the, golden, precepts, as, with, the, secret, doctrine, most, scholars, of, buddhism, have, doubted, that, this, latter, text, was, an, authentic, tibetan, buddhist, document, she, continued, to, face, accusations, of, fraud, u, s, newspaper, the, sun, published, a, july, 1890, article, based, on, information, provided, by, an, ex, member, of, the, society, elliott, coues, blavatsky, sued, the, newspaper, for, libel, and, they, publicly, retracted, their, accusations, in, september, 1892, that, winter, britain, had, been, afflicted, by, an, influenza, epidemic, the, global, 1889, 1890, flu, pandemic, with, blavatsky, contracting, the, virus, it, led, to, her, death, on, the, afternoon, of, 8, may, 1891, in, besant, s, house, the, date, would, come, to, be, commemorated, by, theosophists, ever, since, as, white, lotus, day, her, body, was, cremated, at, woking, crematorium, on, 11, may, blavatsky, talked, incessantly, in, a, guttural, voice, sometimes, wittily, and, sometimes, crudely, she, was, indifferent, to, sex, yet, frank, and, open, about, it, fonder, of, animals, than, of, people, welcoming, unpretentious, scandalous, capricious, and, rather, noisy, she, was, also, humorous, vulgar, impulsive, and, warm, hearted, and, didn, t, give, a, hoot, for, anyone, or, anything, biographer, peter, washington, 1993, the, biographer, peter, washington, described, blavatsky, as, a, short, stout, forceful, woman, with, strong, arms, several, chins, unruly, hair, a, determined, mouth, and, large, liquid, slightly, bulging, eyes, she, had, distinctive, azure, colored, eyes, and, was, overweight, throughout, her, life, according, to, the,

was, a, heavy, cigarette, smoker, throughout, her, life, and, was, known, for, smoking, hashish, at, times, she, lived, simply, and, her, followers, believed, that, she, refused, to, accept, monetary, payment, in, return, for, disseminating, her, teachings, blavatsky, preferred, to, be, known, by, the, initialism, hpb, a, sobriquet, applied, to, her, by, many, of, her, friends, which, was, first, developed, by, olcott, she, avoided, social, functions, and, was, scornful, of, social, obligations, she, spoke, russian, georgian, english, french, italian, arabic, and, sanskrit, meade, referred, to, her, as, an, eccentric, who, abided, by, no, rules, except, her, own, someone, who, had, utter, disregard, for, the, victorian, code, of, morality, meade, believed, that, blavatsky, perceived, herself, as, a, messianic, figure, whose, purpose, was, to, save, the, world, by, promoting, theosophy, lachman, stated, that, blavatsky, exhibited, what, he, referred, to, as, russian, traits, an, intense, devotion, to, spiritual, truth, combined, with, a, profound, contradictory, character, washington, expressed, the, view, that, she, was, a, persuasive, story, teller, power, to, fascinate, others, although, noted, that, she, was, also, self, absorbed, and, egotistical, for, meade, blavatsky, had, a, vivid, imagination, and, a, propensity, for, lying, godwin, noted, that, blavatsky, had, a, fearsome, temper, the, religious, studies, scholar, bruce, f, campbell, noted, that, she, had, been, a, strong, willed, independent, child, and, that, the, harsh, environment, of, her, childhood, might, have, resulted, in, her, difficulty, in, controlling, her, temper, and, her, tendency, to, swear, in, his, opinion, she, represented, an, archetypal, charismatic, leader, anthropologist, leo, klejn, claimed, that, blavatsky, s, indefatigability, and, energy, were, surprising, the, indologist, alexander, senkevich, stated, that, blavatsky, s, charisma, exerted, influence, on, charles, massey, and, stainton, moses, blavatsky, s, sexuality, has, been, an, issue, of, dispute, many, biographers, believed, that, she, remained, celibate, throughout, her, life, with, washington, believing, that, she, hated, sex, with, her, own, sort, of, passion, in, later, life, she, stated, that, she, was, a, virgin, although, she, had, been, married, to, two, men, during, her, lifetime, throughout, its, early, years, the, theosophical, society, promoted, celibacy, even, within, marriage, some, have, suggested, that, she, may, have, been, a, lesbian, or, transvestite, due, to, early, accounts, in, which, she, traveled, while, dressed, in, masculine, attire, meade, thought, that, blavatsky, had, with, a, few, exceptions, been, contemptuous, of, other, women, suggesting, that, while, this, may, have, been, the, result, of, general, societal, misogyny, it, may, have, reflected, that, blavatsky, had, been, jilted, by, another, woman, godwin, suggested, that, blavatsky, s, life, work, was, not, only, spiritual, but, socially, idealistic, and, fiercely, political, he, suggested, that, her, emotional, fuel, was, partly, a, hatred, of, oppression, which, godwin, claimed, was, either, through, the, intellectual, domination, of, christianity, or, british, colonial, rule, in, india, conversely, meade, thought, blavatsky, to, be, basically, a, non, political, person, blavatsky, s, social, and, political, beliefs, like, much, else, in, her, life, are, not, always, consistent, though, reflect, what, she, felt, she, could, reveal, of, a, larger, vision, that, was, more, than, anything, else, the, vision, of, the, succession, of, root, races, these, races, were, a, flexible, category, cultural, as, well, as, physiological, with, races, often, combining, in, the, course, of, history, moreover, inspired, by, recent, acrimonious, debates, over, evolution, they, are, also, dynamic, emergent, forces, gary, lachman, wrote, although, few, historians, have, noted, it, in, isis, unveiled, 1877, blavatsky, presented, the, first, major, intellectual, not, religious, criticism, of, evolution, lachman, 2012, 159, 60, blavatsky, held, that, darwinism, explained, human, physical, evolution, while, spirituality, followed, another, developmental, pattern, the, scholar, of, religion, olav, hammer, noted, that, on, rare, occasions, blavatsky, s, writings, are, overtly, racist, adding, that, her, antisemitism, derives, from, the, unfortunate, position, of, judaism, as, the, origin, of, christianity, and, refers, to, the, intense, dislike, she, felt, for, christianity, according, to, meade, blavatsky, assembled, her, theories, and, doctrines, gradually, in, a, piecemeal, fashion, blavatsky, claimed, that, these, theosophical, doctrines, were, not, her, own, invention, but, had, been, received, from, a, brotherhood, of, secretive, spiritual, adepts, whom, she, referred, to, as, the, masters, or, mahatmas, blavatsky, was, the, leading, theoretician, of, the, theosophical, society, responsible, for, establishing, its, doctrinal, basis, the, ideas, expounded, in, her, published, texts, provide, the, basis, from, which, the, society, and, wider, theosophical, movement, emerged, blavatsky, s, theosophical, ideas, were, a, form, of, occultism, she, subscribed, to, the, anti, christian, current, of, thought, within, western, esotericism, which, emphasized, the, idea, of, an, ancient, and, universal, occult, science, that, should, be, revived, blavatsky, stated, that, the, theosophical, teachings, were, passed, on, to, her, by, adepts, who, lived, in, various, parts, of, the, world, fundamentally, the, underlying, concept, behind, blavatsky, s, theosophy, was, that, there, was, an, ancient, wisdom, religion, which, had, once, been, found, across, the, world, and, which, was, known, to, various, ancient, figures, such, as, the, greek, philosopher, plato, and, the, ancient, hindu, sages, blavatsky, connected, this, ancient, wisdom, religion, to, hermetic, philosophy, a, worldview, in, which, everything, in, the, universe, is, identified, as, an, emanation, from, a, godhead, blavatsky, believed, that, all, of, the, world, s, religions, developed, from, this, original, global, faith, blavatsky, understood, her, theosophy, to, be, the, heir, to, the, neoplatonist, philosophers, of, late, antiquity, who, had, also, embraced, hermetic, philosophy, blavatsky, claimed, that, due, to, christianization, in, europe, this, magical, tradition, was, lost, there, but, it, persisted, in, modified, form, in, india, and, africa, promoting, a, self, consciously, magical, disenchantment, narrative, in, turn, blavatsky, believed, that, the, theosophical, movement, s, revival, of, the, ancient, wisdom, religion, would, lead, to, it, spreading, across, the, world, eclipsing, the, established, world, religions, thus, in, bringing, these, theosophical, ideas, to, humanity, blavatsky, viewed, herself, as, a, messianic, figure, according, to, goodrick, clarke, the, theosophical, society, disseminated, an, elaborate, philosophical, edifice, involving, a, cosmogony, the, macrocosm, of, the, universe, spiritual, hierarchies, and, intermediary, beings, the, latter, having, correspondences, with, a, hierarchical, conception, of, the, microcosm, of, man, officially, the, society, based, itself, upon, the, following, three, objectives, washington, believed, that, the, purpose, of, these, three, precepts, was, to, lead, to, the, discovery, of, the, powers, latent, in, man, through, the, occult, study, of, science, philosophy, and, religion, shall, be, the, preferred, route, to, the, social, harmony, and, equality, which, will, prefigure, and, perhaps, become, the, divine, harmony, while, living, in, new, york, city, blavatsky, had, referred, to, herself, as, a, buddhist, although, officially, embraced, buddhism, only, while, in, ceylon, however, lachman, stated, that, her, buddhism, was, highly, eccentric, and, had, little, to, do, with, the, buddhism, of, scholars, like, m, ller, or, that, of, your, average, buddhist, blavatsky, argued, that, the, buddha, had, sought, to, return, to, the, teachings, of, the, vedas, and, that, buddhism, therefore, represented, a, more, accurate, survival, of, ancient, brahmanism, than, modern, hinduism, although, critical, of, catholicism, and, protestantism, and, opposing, their, growth, in, asia, throughout, her, life, she, remained, highly, sympathetic, to, the, russian, orthodox, church, commenting, that, with, the, faith, of, the, russian, church, i, will, not, even, compare, buddhism, g, r, s, mead, proclaimed, two, things, in, all, the, chaos, of, her, cosmos, stood, firm, in, every, mood, that, her, teachers, existed, and, that, she, had, not, cheated, blavatsky, s, writings, garnered, the, materials, of, neoplatonism, renaissance, magic, kabbalah, and, freemasonry, together, with, ancient, egyptian, and, greco, roman, mythology, and, religion, joined, by, eastern, doctrines, taken, from, buddhism, and, advaita, vedanta, to, present, the, idea, of, an, ancient, wisdom, handed, down, from, prehistoric, times, historian, nicholas, goodrick, clarke, 2008, blavatsky, expounded, what, has, been, described, as, a, monotheistic, immanentist, and, mystical, cosmology, blavatsky, was, a, pantheist, and, emphasized, the, idea, of, an, impersonal, divinity, referring, to, the, theosophical, god, as, a, universal, divine, principle, the, root, of, all, from, which, all, proceeds, and, within, which, all, shall, be, absorbed, at, the, end, of, the, great, cycle, of, being, she, was, dismissive, of, the, christian, idea, of, god, in, the, western, world, describing, it, as, a, bundle, of, contradictions, and, a, logical, impossibility, she, stated, that, the, universe, emanated, from, this, divine, principle, with, each, particle, of, matter, being, infused, with, a, spark, of, the, divine, lower, orders, emanated, from, higher, ones, before, becoming, increasingly, dense, and, being, absorbed, back, into, the, divine, principle, this, cosmology, exhibited, commonalities, with, the, scientific, discoveries, of, geology, and, biological, evolution, both, of, which, had, been, revealed, by, scientific, inquiry, during, the, 19th, century, in, the, secret, doctrine, blavatsky, articulated, the, belief, that, in, the, beginning, of, time, there, was, absolute, nothingness, this, primordial, essence, then, separated, itself, into, seven, rays, which, were, also, intelligent, beings, known, as, the, dhyan, chohans, these, seven, rays, then, created, the, universe, using, an, energy, called, fohat, the, earth, was, created, and, underwent, seven, rounds, in, each, of, which, different, living, beings, were, created, blavatsky, advocated, the, idea, of, root, races, each, of, which, was, divided, into, seven, sub, races, in, blavatsky, s, cosmogony, the, first, root, race, were, created, from, pure, spirit, and, lived, on, a, continent, known, as, the, imperishable, sacred, land, the, second, root, race, known, as, the, hyperboreans, were, also, formed, from, pure, spirit, and, lived, on, a, land, near, to, the, north, pole, which, then, had, a, mild, climate, the, third, lived, on, the, continent, of, lemuria, which, blavatsky, alleged, survives, today, as, australia, and, rapa, nui, blavatsky, alleged, that, during, the, fourth, round, of, the, earth, higher, beings, descended, to, the, planet, with, the, beginnings, of, human, physical, bodies, developing, and, the, sexes, separating, at, this, point, the, fourth, root, race, appeared, living, on, the, continent, of, atlantis, they, had, physical, bodies, but, also, psychic, powers, and, advanced, technology, she, claimed, that, some, atlanteans, were, giants, and, built, such, ancient, monuments, as, stonehenge, in, southern, england, and, that, they, also, mated, with, she, animals, resulting, in, the, creation, of, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, the, atlanteans, were, decadent, and, abused, their, power, and, knowledge, so, atlantis, sunk, into, the, sea, although, various, atlanteans, escaped, and, created, new, societies, in, egypt, and, the, americas, the, fifth, root, race, to, emerge, was, the, aryans, and, was, found, across, the, world, at, the, time, she, was, writing, she, believed, that, the, fifth, race, would, come, to, be, replaced, by, the, sixth, which, would, be, heralded, by, the, arrival, of, maitreya, a, figure, from, mahayana, buddhist, mythology, she, further, believed, that, humanity, would, eventually, develop, into, the, final, seventh, root, race, lachman, suggested, that, by, reading, blavatsky, s, cosmogonical, claims, as, a, literal, account, of, history, we, may, be, doing, it, a, disservice, he, instead, suggested, that, it, could, be, read, as, blavatsky, s, attempt, to, formulate, a, new, myth, for, the, modern, age, or, as, a, huge, fantastic, science, fiction, story, blavatsky, taught, that, humans, composed, of, three, separate, parts, a, divine, spark, an, astral, fluid, body, and, the, physical, body, later, blavatsky, proclaimed, the, septenary, of, man, and, universe, according, to, blavatsky, man, is, composed, of, seven, parts, atma, buddhi, manas, kama, rupa, linga, sharira, prana, and, sthula, sharira, in, isis, unveiled, blavatsky, denied, that, humans, would, be, reincarnated, back, on, the, earth, after, physical, death, however, by, the, time, that, she, had, authored, the, secret, doctrine, she, had, changed, her, opinion, on, this, issue, likely, influenced, by, her, time, in, india, here, she, stated, that, the, law, of, reincarnation, was, governed, by, karma, with, humanity, s, final, purpose, being, the, emancipation, of, the, soul, from, the, cycle, of, death, and, rebirth, she, believed, that, knowledge, of, karma, would, ensure, that, human, beings, lived, according, to, moral, principles, arguing, that, it, provided, a, far, greater, basis, for, moral, action, than, that, of, the, christian, doctrine, blavatsky, wrote, in, isis, unveiled, that, spiritualism, alone, offers, a, possible, last, refuge, of, compromise, between, the, revealed, religions, and, materialistic, philosophies, while, she, acknowledged, that, fanatic, believers, remained, blind, to, its, imperfections, she, wrote, that, such, a, fact, was, no, excuse, to, doubt, its, reality, and, asserted, that, spiritualist, fanaticism, was, itself, a, proof, of, the, genuineness, and, possibility, of, their, phenomena, goodrick, clarke, noted, that, blavatsky, s, cosmology, contained, all, four, of, the, prime, characteristics, of, western, esotericism, that, had, been, identified, by, the, scholar, antoine, faivre, a, correspondences, between, all, parts, of, the, universe, the, macrocosm, and, microcosm, b, living, nature, as, a, complex, plural, hierarchical, and, animate, whole, c, imagination, and, mediations, in, the, form, of, intermediary, spirits, symbols, and, mandalas, and, d, the, experience, of, transmutation, of, the, soul, through, purification, and, ascent, one, of, the, most, significant, controversial, and, prolific, of, modern, esotericists, it, is, more, than, evident, that, whatever, one, thinks, of, the, more, flamboyant, aspects, of, this, remarkable, and, many, sided, woman, she, possessed, a, keen, intellect, and, a, wide, ranging, vision, of, what, occultism, could, be, in, the, modern, world, robert, ellwood, 2005, religious, studies, scholar, and, vice, president, of, the, theosophical, society, in, america, 2002, 2005, blavatsky, was, and, is, a, controversial, figure, blavatsky, s, devotees, often, try, to, attribute, the, criticism, that, she, has, sustained, to, the, fact, that, she, attacked, the, vested, interests, of, both, the, christian, establishment, and, the, material, scientific, skeptics, rather, than, as, a, reaction, to, her, alleged, frauds, and, impostures, thus, all, critics, of, her, are, deflected, by, her, believers, who, say, that, the, slanders, on, her, reputation, are, the, signs, of, grace, the, stigmata, that, all, great, martyrs, must, bear, various, authors, including, william, emmette, coleman, and, others, have, questioned, the, authenticity, of, her, writings, by, citing, evidence, that, they, are, heavily, plagiarized, from, older, esoteric, sources, pronouncing, her, claim, of, the, existence, of, masters, of, wisdom, to, be, utterly, false, and, accusing, her, of, being, a, charlatan, false, medium, and, falsifier, of, letters, eastern, literature, scholar, arthur, lillie, published, a, list, of, extracts, from, mystic, works, next, to, extracts, from, blavatsky, s, writings, purporting, to, show, her, extensive, plagiarism, in, his, book, madame, blavatsky, and, her, theosophy, lillie, also, analyzed, the, mahatma, letters, and, asserted, based, on, peculiarities, of, expression, and, spelling, that, they, had, been, written, by, blavatsky, the, traditionalist, school, writer, ren, gu, non, wrote, a, detailed, critique, of, theosophy, in, which, he, claimed, that, blavatsky, had, acquired, all, her, knowledge, naturally, from, other, books, rather, than, supernatural, so, called, masters, carl, jung, virulently, criticized, her, work, and, agehananda, bharati, dismissed, it, as, a, melee, of, horrendous, hogwash, and, of, fertile, inventions, of, inane, esoterica, mircea, eliade, suggested, that, her, theory, of, spiritual, evolution, contradicts, the, entire, spirit, of, eastern, tradition, which, is, precisely, an, anti, evolutionist, conception, of, the, spiritual, life, after, her, death, blavatsky, continued, to, be, accused, of, having, fraudulently, produced, paranormal, phenomena, by, skeptics, such, as, john, nevil, maskelyne, robert, todd, carroll, and, james, randi, according, to, religious, studies, scholar, mark, bevir, blavatsky, adapted, the, occult, tradition, to, meet, the, challenge, of, victorian, science, and, morality, historian, ronald, hutton, described, blavatsky, as, one, of, the, century, s, truly, international, figures, whose, ideas, gained, considerable, popularity, various, biographers, have, noted, that, by, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, blavatsky, was, little, known, among, the, general, public, in, 2006, scholar, james, a, santucci, nevertheless, noted, that, she, was, as, visible, today, as, any, modern, trend, setting, guru, and, she, will, most, likely, remain, the, most, memorable, and, innovative, esotericist, of, the, 19th, century, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, blavatsky, sometimes, spoke, and, or, wrote, while, in, altered, states, of, consciousness, g, r, s, mead, wrote, about, blavatsky, i, know, no, one, who, detested, more, than, she, did, any, attempt, to, hero, worship, herself, she, positively, physically, shuddered, at, any, expression, of, reverence, to, herself, as, a, spiritual, teacher, i, have, heard, her, cry, out, in, genuine, alarm, at, an, attempt, to, kneel, to, her, made, by, an, enthusiastic, admirer, leo, klejn, wrote, about, blavatsky, indefatigability, and, energy, of, this, woman, were, surprising, she, had, a, revolutionary, s, merits, mabel, collins, an, associate, and, publisher, of, lucifer, between, 1887, and, 1889, believed, blavatsky, s, influence, to, be, derived, largely, from, a, talent, for, manipulation, after, leaving, the, theosopical, movement, collins, said, that, she, taught, me, one, great, lesson, i, learned, from, her, how, foolish, how, gullible, how, easily, flattered, human, beings, are, taken, en, masse, her, contempt, for, her, kind, was, on, the, same, gigantic, scale, as, everything, else, about, her, except, her, marvellously, delicate, taper, fingers, in, all, else, she, was, a, big, woman, she, had, a, greater, power, over, the, weak, and, credulous, a, greater, capacity, for, making, black, appear, white, a, larger, waist, a, more, voracious, appetite, a, more, confirmed, passion, for, tobacco, a, more, ceaseless, and, insatiable, hatred, for, those, whom, she, thought, to, be, her, enemies, a, greater, disrespect, for, les, convenances, a, worse, temper, a, greater, command, of, bad, language, and, a, greater, contempt, for, the, intelligence, of, her, fellow, beings, than, i, had, ever, supposed, possible, to, be, contained, in, one, person, these, i, suppose, must, be, reckoned, as, her, vices, though, whether, a, creature, so, indifferent, to, all, ordinary, standards, of, right, and, wrong, can, be, held, to, have, virtues, or, vices, i, know, not, blavatsky, presented, her, book, the, voice, of, the, silence, to, leo, tolstoy, in, his, works, tolstoy, used, the, dicta, from, theosophischer, wegweiser, a, theosophical, journal, in, his, 12, february, 1903, diary, entry, tolstoy, wrote, i, am, reading, a, beautiful, theosophical, journal, and, find, many, commonalities, with, my, understanding, according, to, kalnitsky, the, theosophical, movement, of, the, nineteenth, century, was, created, and, defined, in, the, main, through, the, astuteness, and, conceptual, ideas, provided, by, h, p, blavatsky, he, stated, that, without, her, charismatic, leadership, and, uncompromising, promotion, of, the, theosophical, agenda, it, appears, unlikely, that, the, movement, could, have, attained, its, unique, form, by, the, time, of, her, death, in, 1891, she, was, the, acknowledged, head, of, a, community, numbering, nearly, 100, 000, with, journalistic, organs, in, london, paris, new, york, and, madras, her, writings, have, been, translated, and, published, in, a, wide, range, of, european, and, asian, languages, blavatsky, s, theosophy, redirected, the, interest, in, spiritualism, toward, a, more, coherent, doctrine, that, included, cosmology, with, theory, of, evolution, in, an, understanding, of, humanity, s, spiritual, development, further, it, took, the, traditional, sources, of, western, esotericism, and, globalized, them, by, restating, many, of, their, ideas, in, terminology, adopted, from, asian, religions, blavatsky, s, theosophy, was, able, to, appeal, to, women, by, de, emphasizing, the, importance, of, gender, and, allowing, them, to, take, on, spiritual, leadership, equal, to, that, of, men, thus, allowing, them, a, greater, role, than, that, permitted, in, traditional, christianity, since, its, inception, and, through, doctrinal, assimilation, or, divergence, theosophy, has, also, given, rise, to, or, influenced, the, development, of, other, mystical, philosophical, and, religious, movements, during, the, 1920s, the, theosophical, society, adyar, had, around, 7, 000, members, in, the, u, s, there, also, was, a, substantial, following, in, asia, according, to, a, theosophical, source, the, indian, section, in, 2008, was, said, to, have, around, 13, 000, members, while, in, the, us, the, 2008, membership, was, reported, at, around, 3, 900, blavatsky, s, theosophy, has, been, described, as, representing, a, major, factor, in, the, modern, revival, of, western, esotericism, godwin, deemed, there, to, be, no, more, important, figure, in, modern, times, within, the, western, esoteric, tradition, than, blavatsky, for, johnson, blavatsky, was, a, central, figure, in, the, nineteenth, century, occult, revival, lachman, claimed, that, practically, all, modern, occultism, and, esotericism, can, trace, its, origins, back, to, her, influence, blavatsky, s, published, theosophical, ideas, particularly, those, regarding, root, races, have, been, cited, as, an, influence, on, ariosophy, the, esoteric, movement, established, in, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, germany, and, austria, by, guido, von, list, and, j, rg, lanz, von, liebenfels, hannah, newman, stated, that, via, ariosophy, blavatsky, s, theosophical, ideas, contributed, to, nazi, ideology, nevertheless, lachman, has, asserted, that, blavatsky, should, not, be, held, accountable, to, any, of, the, antisemitic, and, racist, ideas, that, the, ariosophists, promoted, commenting, that, were, she, alive, to, witness, the, development, of, ariosophy, she, probably, would, have, denounced, its, ideas, regarding, race, blavatsky, s, theosophical, ideas, regarding, root, races, have, also, been, cited, as, an, influence, on, anthroposophy, the, esoteric, movement, developed, by, rudolf, steiner, in, early, 20th, century, germany, with, steiner, s, anthroposophical, society, being, termed, a, historical, offshoot, of, the, theosophical, society, blavatsky, s, theosophy, has, been, cited, as, an, influence, on, the, new, age, movement, an, esoteric, current, that, emerged, in, western, nations, during, the, 1970s, no, single, organization, or, movement, has, contributed, so, many, components, to, the, new, age, movement, as, the, theosophical, society, it, has, been, the, major, force, in, the, dissemination, of, occult, literature, in, the, west, in, the, twentieth, century, other, organizations, loosely, based, on, theosophical, texts, and, doctrines, include, the, agni, yoga, and, a, group, of, religions, based, on, theosophy, called, the, ascended, master, teachings, the, i, am, activity, the, bridge, to, freedom, universal, medicine, and, the, summit, lighthouse, which, evolved, into, the, church, universal, and, triumphant, american, scholar, of, religion, jason, josephson, storm, has, argued, that, blavatsky, and, her, theosophical, society, influenced, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, academic, linguistics, josephson, storm, notes, that, blavatsky, s, linguistic, theories, and, typologies, were, widely, circulated, in, europe, and, that, influential, linguists, such, as, mile, louis, burnouf, and, benjamin, lee, whorf, either,
