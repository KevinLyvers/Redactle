years, brought, him, into, conflict, with, the, eastern, roman, empire, in, constantinople, through, his, assumption, of, the, imperial, title, he, is, considered, the, forerunner, to, the, line, of, holy, roman, emperors, which, persisted, into, the, nineteenth, century, as, king, and, emperor, charlemagne, engaged, in, a, number, of, reforms, in, administration, law, education, military,

on, the, middle, ages, and, influence, on, the, territory, he, ruled, has, led, him, to, be, called, the, father, of, europe, by, many, historians, he, is, seen, as, a, founding, figure, by, multiple, european, states, and, a, number, of, historical, royal, houses, of, europe, trace, their, lineage, back, to, him, charlemagne, has, been, the, subject, of, artworks, monuments, and, literature, during, and, after, the, medieval, period, and, is, venerated, by, the, catholic, church, several, languages, were, spoken, in, charlemagne, s, world, and, he, was, known, to, contemporaries, as, karlus, in, the, old, high, german, he, spoke, as, karlo, to, early, old, french, or, proto, romance, speakers, and, as, carolus, or, karolus, in, medieval, latin, the, formal, language, of, writing, and, diplomacy, charles, is, the, modern, english, form, of, these, names, the, name, charlemagne, as, the, emperor, is, normally, known, in, english, comes, from, the, french, charles, le, magne, charles, the, great, in, modern, german, he, is, known, as, karl, der, gro, e, the, latin, epithet, magnus, great, may, have, been, associated, with, him, during, his, lifetime, but, this, is, not, certain, the, contemporary, royal, frankish, annals, routinely, call, him, carolus, magnus, rex, charles, the, great, king, that, epithet, is, attested, in, the, works, of, the, poeta, saxo, around, 900, and, it, had, become, commonly, applied, to, him, by, 1000, charlemagne, was, named, after, his, grandfather, charles, martel, that, name, and, its, derivatives, are, unattested, before, their, use, by, charles, martel, and, charlemagne, karolus, was, adapted, by, slavic, languages, as, their, word, for, king, russian, korol, polish, kr, l, and, slovak, kr, l, through, charlemagne, s, influence, or, that, of, his, great, grandson, charles, the, fat, by, the, sixth, century, the, western, germanic, tribe, of, the, franks, had, been, christianised, this, was, due, in, considerable, measure, to, the, conversion, of, their, king, clovis, i, to, catholicism, the, franks, had, established, a, kingdom, in, gaul, in, the, wake, of, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, this, kingdom, francia, grew, to, encompass, nearly, all, of, present, day, france, and, switzerland, along, with, parts, of, modern, germany, and, the, low, countries, under, the, rule, of, the, merovingian, dynasty, francia, was, often, divided, under, different, merovingian, kings, due, to, the, partible, inheritance, practised, by, the, franks, the, late, seventh, century, saw, a, period, of, war, and, instability, following, the, murder, of, king, childeric, ii, which, led, to, factional, struggles, among, the, frankish, aristocrats, pepin, of, herstal, mayor, of, the, palace, of, austrasia, ended, the, strife, between, various, kings, and, their, mayors, with, his, 687, victory, at, the, battle, of, tertry, pepin, was, the, grandson, of, two, important, figures, of, austrasia, arnulf, of, metz, and, pepin, of, landen, the, mayors, of, the, palace, had, gained, influence, as, the, merovingian, kings, power, waned, due, to, divisions, of, the, kingdom, and, several, succession, crises, pepin, was, eventually, succeeded, by, his, son, charles, later, known, as, charles, martel, charles, did, not, support, a, merovingian, successor, upon, the, death, of, king, theuderic, iv, in, 737, leaving, the, throne, vacant, he, made, plans, to, divide, the, kingdom, between, his, sons, carloman, and, pepin, the, short, who, succeeded, him, after, his, death, in, 741, the, brothers, placed, the, merovingian, childeric, iii, on, the, throne, in, 743, pepin, married, bertrada, a, member, of, an, influential, austrasian, noble, family, in, 744, in, 747, carloman, abdicated, and, entered, a, monastery, in, rome, he, had, at, least, two, sons, the, elder, drogo, took, his, place, charlemagne, s, year, of, birth, is, uncertain, although, it, was, most, likely, in, 748, an, older, tradition, based, on, three, sources, however, gives, a, birth, year, of, 742, the, ninth, century, biographer, einhard, reports, charlemagne, as, being, 72, years, old, at, the, time, of, his, death, the, royal, frankish, annals, imprecisely, gives, his, age, at, death, as, about, 71, and, his, original, epitaph, called, him, a, septuagenarian, einhard, said, that, he, did, not, know, much, about, charlemagne, s, early, life, some, modern, scholars, believe, that, not, knowing, the, emperor, s, true, age, he, still, sought, to, present, an, exact, date, in, keeping, with, the, roman, imperial, biographies, of, suetonius, which, he, used, as, a, model, all, three, sources, may, have, been, influenced, by, psalm, 90, the, days, of, our, years, are, threescore, years, and, ten, historian, karl, ferdinand, werner, challenged, the, acceptance, of, 742, as, the, frankish, king, s, birth, year, citing, an, addition, to, the, annales, petaviani, which, records, charlemagne, s, birth, in, 747, lorsch, abbey, commemorated, charlemagne, s, date, of, birth, as, 2, april, from, the, mid, ninth, century, and, this, date, is, likely, to, be, genuine, matthias, becher, built, on, werner, s, work, and, showed, that, 2, april, in, the, year, recorded, would, have, actually, been, in, 748, since, the, annalists, recorded, the, start, of, the, year, from, easter, rather, than, 1, january, presently, most, scholars, accept, april, 748, for, charlemagne, s, birth, charlemagne, s, place, of, birth, is, unknown, the, frankish, palaces, in, vaires, sur, marne, and, quierzy, are, among, the, places, suggested, by, scholars, pepin, the, short, held, an, assembly, in, d, ren, in, 748, but, it, cannot, be, proved, that, it, took, place, in, april, or, if, bertrada, was, with, him, einhard, refers, to, charlemagne, s, patrius, sermo, native, tongue, most, scholars, have, identified, this, as, a, form, of, old, high, german, probably, a, rhenish, franconian, dialect, due, to, the, prevalence, in, francia, of, rustic, roman, he, was, probably, functionally, bilingual, in, germanic, and, romance, dialects, at, an, early, age, charlemagne, also, spoke, latin, and, according, to, einhard, could, understand, and, perhaps, speak, some, greek, charlemagne, s, father, pepin, had, been, educated, at, the, abbey, of, saint, denis, although, the, extent, of, charlemagne, s, formal, education, is, unknown, he, almost, certainly, was, trained, in, military, matters, as, a, youth, in, pepin, s, court, which, was, itinerant, charlemagne, also, asserted, his, own, education, in, the, liberal, arts, in, encouraging, their, study, by, his, children, and, others, although, it, is, unknown, whether, his, study, was, as, a, child, or, at, court, during, his, later, life, the, question, of, charlemagne, s, literacy, is, debated, with, little, direct, evidence, from, contemporary, sources, he, normally, had, texts, read, aloud, to, him, and, dictated, responses, and, decrees, but, this, was, not, unusual, even, for, a, literate, ruler, at, the, time, historian, johannes, fried, considers, it, likely, that, charlemagne, would, have, been, able, to, read, but, the, medievalist, paul, dutton, writes, that, the, evidence, for, his, ability, to, read, is, circumstantial, and, inferential, at, best, and, concludes, that, it, is, likely, that, he, never, properly, mastered, the, skill, einhard, makes, no, direct, mention, of, charlemagne, reading, and, recorded, that, he, only, attempted, to, learn, to, write, later, in, life, there, are, only, occasional, references, to, charlemagne, in, the, frankish, annals, during, his, father, s, lifetime, by, 751, or, 752, pepin, had, deposed, childeric, and, replaced, him, as, king, early, carolingian, influenced, sources, claim, that, pepin, s, seizure, of, the, throne, was, sanctioned, beforehand, by, pope, stephen, ii, but, modern, historians, dispute, this, it, is, possible, that, papal, approval, came, only, when, stephen, travelled, to, francia, in, 754, apparently, to, request, pepin, s, aid, against, the, lombards, and, on, this, trip, anointed, pepin, as, king, this, legitimised, his, rule, charlemagne, was, sent, to, greet, and, escort, the, pope, and, he, and, his, younger, brother, carloman, were, anointed, with, their, father, pepin, sidelined, drogo, around, the, same, time, sending, him, and, his, brother, to, a, monastery, charlemagne, began, issuing, charters, in, his, own, name, in, 760, the, following, year, he, joined, his, father, s, campaign, against, aquitaine, aquitaine, led, by, dukes, hunald, and, waiofar, was, constantly, in, rebellion, during, pepin, s, reign, pepin, fell, ill, on, campaign, there, and, died, on, 24, september, 768, and, charlemagne, and, carloman, succeeded, their, father, they, had, separate, coronations, charlemagne, at, noyon, and, carloman, at, soissons, on, 9, october, the, brothers, maintained, separate, palaces, and, spheres, of, influence, although, they, were, considered, joint, rulers, of, a, single, frankish, kingdom, the, royal, frankish, annals, report, that, charlemagne, ruled, austrasia, and, carloman, ruled, burgundy, provence, aquitaine, and, alamannia, with, no, mention, made, of, which, brother, received, neustria, the, immediate, concern, of, the, brothers, was, the, ongoing, uprising, in, aquitaine, they, marched, into, aquitaine, together, but, carloman, returned, to, francia, for, unknown, reasons, and, charlemagne, completed, the, campaign, on, his, own, charlemagne, s, capture, of, duke, hunald, marked, the, end, of, ten, years, of, war, that, had, been, waged, in, the, attempt, to, bring, aquitaine, into, line, carloman, s, refusal, to, participate, in, the, war, against, aquitaine, led, to, a, rift, between, the, kings, it, is, uncertain, why, carloman, abandoned, the, campaign, the, brothers, may, have, disagreed, about, control, of, the, territory, or, carloman, was, focused, on, securing, his, rule, in, the, north, of, francia, regardless, of, the, strife, between, the, kings, they, maintained, a, joint, rule, for, practical, reasons, charlemagne, and, carloman, worked, to, obtain, the, support, of, the, clergy, and, local, elites, to, solidify, their, positions, pope, stephen, iii, was, elected, in, 768, but, was, briefly, deposed, by, antipope, constantine, ii, before, being, restored, to, rome, stephen, s, papacy, experienced, continuing, factional, struggles, so, he, sought, support, from, the, frankish, kings, both, brothers, sent, troops, to, rome, each, hoping, to, exert, his, own, influence, the, lombard, king, desiderius, also, had, interests, in, roman, affairs, and, charlemagne, attempted, to, enlist, him, as, an, ally, desiderius, already, had, alliances, with, bavaria, and, benevento, through, the, marriages, of, his, daughters, to, their, dukes, and, an, alliance, with, charlemagne, would, add, to, his, influence, charlemagne, s, mother, bertrada, went, on, his, behalf, to, lombardy, in, 770, and, brokered, a, marriage, alliance, before, returning, to, francia, with, his, new, bride, desiderius, s, daughter, is, traditionally, known, as, desiderata, although, she, may, have, been, named, gerperga, anxious, about, the, prospect, of, a, frankish, lombard, alliance, pope, stephen, sent, a, letter, to, both, frankish, kings, decrying, the, marriage, and, separately, sought, closer, ties, with, carloman, charlemagne, had, already, had, a, relationship, with, the, frankish, noblewoman, himiltrude, and, they, had, a, son, in, 769, named, pepin, paul, the, deacon, wrote, in, his, 784, gesta, episcoporum, mettensium, that, pepin, was, born, before, legal, marriage, but, does, not, say, whether, charles, and, himiltrude, ever, married, were, joined, in, a, non, canonical, marriage, friedelehe, or, married, after, pepin, was, born, pope, stephen, s, letter, described, the, relationship, as, a, legitimate, marriage, but, he, had, a, vested, interest, in, preventing, charlemagne, from, marrying, desiderius, s, daughter, carloman, died, suddenly, on, 4, december, 771, leaving, charlemagne, sole, king, of, the, franks, he, moved, immediately, to, secure, his, hold, on, his, brother, s, territory, forcing, carloman, s, widow, gerberga, to, flee, to, desiderius, s, court, in, lombardy, with, their, children, charlemagne, ended, his, marriage, to, desiderius, s, daughter, and, married, hildegard, daughter, of, count, gerold, a, powerful, magnate, in, carloman, s, kingdom, this, was, a, reaction, to, desiderius, s, sheltering, of, carloman, s, family, and, a, move, to, secure, gerold, s, support, charlemagne, s, first, campaigning, season, as, sole, king, of, the, franks, was, spent, on, the, eastern, frontier, in, his, first, war, against, the, saxons, who, had, been, engaging, in, border, raids, on, the, frankish, kingdom, when, charlemagne, responded, by, destroying, the, pagan, irminsul, at, eresburg, and, seizing, their, gold, and, silver, the, success, of, the, war, helped, secure, charlemagne, s, reputation, among, his, brother, s, former, supporters, and, funded, further, military, action, the, campaign, was, the, beginning, of, over, thirty, years, of, nearly, continuous, warfare, against, the, saxons, by, charlemagne, pope, adrian, i, succeeded, stephen, iii, in, 772, and, sought, the, return, of, papal, control, of, cities, that, had, been, captured, by, desiderius, unsuccessful, in, dealing, with, the, lombard, king, directly, adrian, sent, emissaries, to, charlemagne, to, gain, his, support, for, recovering, papal, territory, charlemagne, in, response, to, this, appeal, and, the, dynastic, threat, of, carloman, s, sons, in, the, lombard, court, gathered, his, forces, to, intervene, he, first, sought, a, diplomatic, solution, offering, gold, to, desiderius, in, exchange, for, the, return, of, the, papal, territories, and, his, nephews, this, overture, was, rejected, and, charlemagne, s, army, commanded, by, himself, and, his, uncle, bernard, crossed, the, alps, to, besiege, the, lombard, capital, of, pavia, in, late, 773, charlemagne, s, second, son, also, named, charles, was, born, in, 772, and, charlemagne, brought, the, child, and, his, wife, to, the, camp, at, pavia, hildegard, was, pregnant, and, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, named, adelhaid, the, baby, was, sent, back, to, francia, but, died, on, the, way, charlemagne, left, bernard, to, maintain, the, siege, at, pavia, while, he, took, a, force, to, capture, verona, where, desiderius, s, son, adalgis, had, taken, carloman, s, sons, charlemagne, captured, the, city, no, further, record, exists, of, his, nephews, or, of, carloman, s, wife, and, their, fate, is, unknown, recent, biographer, janet, nelson, compares, them, to, the, princes, in, the, tower, in, the, wars, of, the, roses, fried, suggests, that, the, boys, were, forced, into, a, monastery, a, common, solution, of, dynastic, issues, or, an, act, of, murder, smooth, charlemagne, s, ascent, to, power, adalgis, was, not, captured, by, charlemagne, and, fled, to, constantinople, charlemagne, left, the, siege, in, april, 774, to, celebrate, easter, in, rome, pope, adrian, arranged, a, formal, welcome, for, the, frankish, king, and, they, swore, oaths, to, each, other, over, the, relics, of, st, peter, adrian, presented, a, copy, of, the, agreement, between, pepin, and, stephen, iii, outlining, the, papal, lands, and, rights, pepin, had, agreed, to, protect, and, restore, it, is, unclear, which, lands, and, rights, the, agreement, involved, which, remained, a, point, of, dispute, for, centuries, charlemagne, placed, a, copy, of, the, agreement, in, the, chapel, above, st, peter, s, tomb, as, a, symbol, of, his, commitment, and, left, rome, to, continue, the, siege, disease, struck, the, lombards, shortly, after, his, return, to, pavia, and, they, surrendered, the, city, by, june, 774, charlemagne, deposed, desiderius, and, took, the, title, of, king, of, the, lombards, the, takeover, of, one, kingdom, by, another, was, extraordinary, and, the, authors, of, the, carolingian, world, call, it, without, parallel, charlemagne, secured, the, support, of, the, lombard, nobles, and, italian, urban, elites, to, seize, power, in, a, mainly, peaceful, annexation, historian, rosamond, mckitterick, suggests, that, the, elective, nature, of, the, lombard, monarchy, eased, charlemagne, s, takeover, and, roger, collins, attributes, the, easy, conquest, to, the, lombard, elite, s, presupposition, that, rightful, authority, was, in, the, hands, of, the, one, powerful, enough, to, seize, it, charlemagne, soon, returned, to, francia, with, the, lombard, royal, treasury, and, with, desiderius, and, his, family, who, would, be, confined, to, a, monastery, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, the, saxons, took, advantage, of, charlemagne, s, absence, in, italy, to, raid, the, frankish, borderlands, leading, to, a, frankish, counter, raid, in, the, autumn, of, 774, and, a, reprisal, campaign, the, following, year, charlemagne, was, soon, drawn, back, to, italy, as, duke, hrodgaud, of, friuli, rebelled, against, him, he, quickly, crushed, the, rebellion, distributing, hrodgaud, s, lands, to, the, franks, to, consolidate, his, rule, in, lombardy, charlemagne, wintered, in, italy, consolidating, his, power, by, issuing, charters, and, legislation, and, taking, lombard, hostages, amid, the, 775, saxon, and, friulian, campaigns, his, daughter, rotrude, was, born, in, francia, returning, north, charlemagne, waged, another, brief, destructive, campaign, against, the, saxons, in, 776, this, led, to, the, submission, of, many, saxons, who, turned, over, captives, and, lands, and, submitted, to, baptism, in, 777, charlemagne, held, an, assembly, at, paderborn, with, frankish, and, saxon, men, many, more, saxons, came, under, his, rule,

charlemagne, s, support, for, al, fihri, s, restoration, also, present, was, sulayman, al, arabi, governor, of, barcelona, and, girona, who, wanted, to, become, part, of, the, frankish, kingdom, and, receive, charlemagne, s, protection, rather, than, remain, under, the, rule, of, c, rdoba, charlemagne, seeing, an, opportunity, to, strengthen, the, security, of, the, kingdom, s, southern, frontier, and, extend, his, influence, agreed, to, intervene, crossing, the, pyrenees, his, army, found, little, resistance, until, an, ambush, by, basque, forces, in, 778, at, the, battle, of, roncevaux, pass,

although, this, figure, may, be, exaggerated, the, basic, truth, of, the, event, is, not, in, doubt, and, alessandro, barbero, calls, it, perhaps, the, greatest, stain, on, his, reputation, charlemagne, issued, the, capitulatio, de, partibus, saxoniae, probably, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, or, as, a, precursor, of, the, massacre, with, a, harsh, set, of, laws, which, included, the, death, penalty, for, pagan, practices, the, capitulatio, constituted, a, program, for, the, forced, conversion, of, the, saxons, and, was, aimed, at, suppressing, saxon, identity, charlemagne, s, focus, for, the, next, several, years, would, be, on, his, attempt, to, complete, the, subjugation, of, the, saxons, concentrating, first, in, westphalia, in, 783, he, pushed, into, thuringia, in, 784, as, his, son, charles, the, younger, continued, operations, in, the, west, at, each, stage, of, the, campaigns, the, frankish, armies, seized, wealth, and, carried, saxon, captives, into, slavery, unusually, charlemagne, campaigned, through, the, winter, instead, of, resting, his, army, by, 785, he, had, suppressed, the, saxon, resistance, and, completely, commanded, westphalia, that, summer, he, met, widukind, and, persuaded, him, to, end, his, resistance, widukind, agreed, to, be, baptised, with, charlemagne, as, his, godfather, ending, this, phase, of, the, saxon, wars, charlemagne, travelled, to, italy, in, 786, arriving, by, christmas, aiming, to, extend, his, influence, further, into, southern, italy, he, marched, into, the, duchy, of, benevento, duke, arechis, fled, to, a, fortified, position, at, salerno, before, offering, charlemagne, his, fealty, charlemagne, accepted, his, submission, and, hostages, who, included, arechis, s, son, grimoald, in, italy, charlemagne, also, met, with, envoys, from, constantinople, empress, irene, had, called, the, 787, second, council, of, nicaea, but, did, not, inform, charlemagne, or, invite, any, frankish, bishops, charlemagne, probably, in, reaction, to, the, perceived, slight, of, the, exclusion, broke, the, betrothal, of, his, daughter, rotrude, and, constantine, vi, after, charlemagne, left, italy, arechis, sent, envoys, to, irene, to, offer, an, alliance, he, suggested, that, she, send, a, byzantine, army, with, adalgis, the, exiled, son, of, desiderus, to, remove, the, franks, from, power, in, lombardy, before, his, plans, could, be, finalised, aldechis, and, his, elder, son, romuald, died, of, illness, within, weeks, of, each, other, charlemagne, sent, grimoald, back, to, benevento, to, serve, as, duke, and, return, it, to, frankish, suzerainty, the, byzantine, army, invaded, but, were, repulsed, by, the, frankish, and, lombard, forces, as, affairs, were, being, settled, in, italy, charlemagne, turned, his, attention, to, bavaria, bavaria, was, ruled, by, duke, tassilo, charlemagne, s, first, cousin, who, had, been, installed, by, pepin, the, short, in, 748, tassilo, s, sons, were, also, grandsons, of, desiderius, and, a, potential, threat, to, charlemagne, s, rule, in, lombardy, the, neighbouring, rulers, had, a, growing, rivalry, throughout, their, reigns, but, had, sworn, oaths, of, peace, to, each, other, in, 781, in, 784, rotpert, charlemagne, s, viceroy, in, italy, accused, tassilo, of, conspiring, with, widukind, in, saxony, and, unsuccessfully, attacked, the, bavarian, city, of, bolzano, charlemagne, gathered, his, forces, to, prepare, for, an, invasion, of, bavaria, in, 787, dividing, the, army, the, franks, launched, a, three, pronged, attack, quickly, realizing, his, poor, position, tassilo, agreed, to, surrender, and, recognise, charlemagne, as, his, overlord, the, following, year, tassilo, was, accused, of, plotting, with, the, avars, to, attack, charlemagne, he, was, deposed, and, sent, to, a, monastery, and, charlemagne, absorbed, bavaria, into, his, kingdom, charlemagne, spent, the, next, few, years, based, in, regensburg, largely, focused, on, consolidating, his, rule, of, bavaria, and, warring, against, the, avars, successful, campaigns, against, them, were, launched, from, bavaria, and, italy, in, 788, and, charlemagne, led, campaigns, in, 791, and, 792, charlemagne, gave, charles, the, younger, rule, of, maine, in, neustria, in, 789, leaving, pepin, the, hunchback, his, only, son, without, lands, his, relationship, with, himiltrude, was, now, apparently, seen, as, illegitimate, at, his, court, and, pepin, was, sidelined, from, the, succession, in, 792, as, his, father, and, brothers, were, gathered, in, regensburg, pepin, conspired, with, bavarian, nobles, to, assassinate, them, and, install, himself, as, king, the, plot, was, discovered, and, revealed, to, charlemagne, before, it, could, proceed, pepin, was, sent, to, a, monastery, and, many, of, his, co, conspirators, were, executed, the, early, 790s, saw, a, marked, focus, on, ecclesiastical, affairs, by, charlemagne, he, summoned, a, council, in, regensburg, in, 792, to, address, the, theological, controversy, over, the, adoptionism, doctrine, in, the, spanish, church, and, formulate, a, response, to, the, second, council, of, nicea, the, council, condemned, adoptionism, as, heresy, and, led, to, the, production, of, the, libri, carolini, a, detailed, argument, against, nicea, s, canons, in, 794, charlemagne, called, another, council, in, frankfurt, the, council, confirmed, regensburg, s, positions, on, adoptionism, and, nicea, recognised, the, deposition, of, tassilo, set, grain, prices, reformed, frankish, coinage, forbade, abbesses, from, blessing, men, and, endorsed, prayer, in, vernacular, languages, soon, after, the, council, fastrada, fell, ill, and, died, charlemagne, married, the, alamannian, noblewoman, luitgard, shortly, afterwards, charlemagne, gathered, an, army, after, the, council, of, frankfurt, as, saxon, resistance, continued, beginning, a, series, of, annual, campaigns, which, lasted, through, 799, the, campaigns, of, the, 790s, were, even, more, destructive, than, those, of, earlier, decades, with, the, annal, writers, frequently, noting, charlemagne, burning, ravaging, devastating, and, laying, waste, the, saxon, lands, charlemagne, forcibly, removed, a, large, number, of, saxons, to, francia, installing, frankish, elites, and, soldiers, in, their, place, his, extended, wars, in, saxony, led, to, his, establishing, his, court, in, aachen, which, had, easy, access, to, the, frontier, he, built, a, large, palace, there, including, a, chapel, which, is, now, part, of, the, aachen, cathedral, einhard, joined, the, court, at, that, time, pepin, of, italy, carloman, engaged, in, further, wars, against, the, avars, in, the, south, which, led, to, the, collapse, of, their, kingdom, and, the, eastward, expansion, of, frankish, rule, charlemagne, also, worked, to, expand, his, influence, through, diplomatic, means, during, the, 790s, wars, focusing, on, the, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, of, britain, charles, the, younger, proposed, a, marriage, pact, with, the, daughter, of, king, offa, of, mercia, but, offa, insisted, that, charlemagne, s, daughter, bertha, also, be, given, as, a, bride, for, his, son, charlemagne, refused, the, arrangement, and, the, marriage, did, not, take, place, charlemagne, and, offa, entered, into, a, formal, peace, in, 796, protecting, trade, and, securing, the, rights, of, english, pilgrims, to, pass, through, francia, on, their, way, to, rome, charlemagne, was, also, the, host, and, protector, of, several, deposed, english, rulers, who, were, later, restored, eadbehrt, of, kent, ecgberht, king, of, wessex, and, eardwulf, of, northumbria, nelson, writes, that, charlemagne, treated, the, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, like, satellite, states, establishing, direct, relations, with, english, bishops, charlemagne, also, forged, an, alliance, with, alfonso, ii, of, asturias, although, einhard, calls, alfonso, his, dependent, following, his, sack, of, lisbon, in, 798, alfonso, sent, charlemagne, trophies, of, his, victory, including, armour, mules, and, prisoners, after, leo, iii, became, pope, in, 795, he, faced, political, opposition, his, enemies, accused, him, of, a, number, of, crimes, and, physically, attacked, him, in, april, 799, attempting, to, remove, his, eyes, and, tongue, leo, escaped, and, fled, north, to, seek, charlemagne, s, help, charlemagne, continued, his, campaign, against, the, saxons, before, breaking, off, to, meet, leo, at, paderborn, in, september, hearing, evidence, from, the, pope, and, his, enemies, he, sent, leo, back, to, rome, with, royal, legates, who, were, instructed, to, reinstate, the, pope, and, conduct, a, further, investigation, in, august, of, the, following, year, charlemagne, made, plans, to, go, to, rome, after, an, extensive, tour, of, his, lands, in, neustria, charlemagne, met, leo, in, november, near, mentana, at, the, twelfth, milestone, outside, rome, the, traditional, location, where, roman, emperors, began, their, formal, entry, into, the, city, charlemagne, presided, over, an, assembly, to, hear, the, charges, but, believed, that, no, one, could, sit, in, judgement, of, the, pope, leo, swore, an, oath, on, 23, december, declaring, his, innocence, of, all, charges, at, mass, in, st, peter, s, basilica, on, christmas, day, 800, leo, proclaimed, charlemagne, emperor, of, the, romans, imperator, romanorum, and, crowned, him, charlemagne, was, the, first, reigning, emperor, in, the, west, since, the, deposition, of, romulus, augustulus, in, 476, his, son, charles, the, younger, was, anointed, king, by, leo, at, the, same, time, historians, differ, about, the, intentions, of, the, imperial, coronation, the, extent, to, which, charlemagne, was, aware, of, it, or, participated, in, its, planning, and, the, significance, of, the, events, for, those, present, and, for, charlemagne, s, reign, contemporary, frankish, and, papal, sources, differ, in, their, emphasis, on, and, representation, of, events, einhard, writes, that, charlemagne, would, not, have, entered, the, church, if, he, knew, about, the, pope, s, plan, modern, historians, have, regarded, his, report, as, truthful, or, rejected, it, as, a, literary, device, demonstrating, charlemagne, s, humility, collins, says, that, the, actions, surrounding, the, coronation, indicate, that, it, was, planned, by, charlemagne, as, early, as, his, meeting, with, leo, in, 799, and, fried, writes, that, charlemagne, planned, to, adopt, the, title, of, emperor, by, 798, at, the, latest, during, the, years, before, the, coronation, charlemagne, s, courtier, alcuin, referred, to, his, realm, as, an, imperium, christianum, christian, empire, in, which, just, as, the, inhabitants, of, the, roman, empire, had, been, united, by, a, common, roman, citizenship, the, new, empire, would, be, united, by, a, common, christian, faith, this, is, the, view, of, henri, pirenne, who, says, that, charles, was, the, emperor, of, the, ecclesia, as, the, pope, conceived, it, of, the, roman, church, regarded, as, the, universal, church, the, eastern, roman, byzantine, empire, remained, a, significant, contemporary, power, in, european, politics, for, leo, and, charlemagne, especially, in, italy, the, byzantines, continued, to, hold, a, substantial, portion, of, italy, with, their, borders, not, far, south, of, rome, empress, irene, had, seized, the, throne, from, her, son, constantine, vi, in, 797, deposing, and, blinding, him, irene, the, first, byzantine, empress, faced, opposition, in, constantinople, because, of, her, gender, and, her, means, of, accession, one, of, the, earliest, narrative, sources, for, the, coronation, the, annals, of, lorsch, presented, a, female, ruler, in, constantinople, as, a, vacancy, in, the, imperial, title, which, justified, leo, s, coronation, of, charlemagne, pirenne, disagrees, saying, that, the, coronation, was, not, in, any, sense, explained, by, the, fact, that, at, this, moment, a, woman, was, reigning, in, constantinople, leo, s, main, motivations, may, have, been, the, desire, to, increase, his, standing, after, his, political, difficulties, placing, himself, as, a, power, broker, and, securing, charlemagne, as, a, powerful, ally, and, protector, the, byzantine, empire, s, lack, of, ability, to, influence, events, in, italy, and, support, the, papacy, were, also, important, to, leo, s, position, according, to, the, royal, frankish, annals, leo, prostrated, himself, before, charlemagne, after, crowning, him, an, act, of, submission, standard, in, roman, coronation, rituals, from, the, time, of, diocletian, this, account, presents, leo, not, as, charlemagne, s, superior, but, as, the, agent, of, the, roman, people, who, acclaimed, charlemagne, as, emperor, historian, henry, mayr, harting, claims, that, the, assumption, of, the, imperial, title, by, charlemagne, was, an, effort, to, incorporate, the, saxons, into, the, frankish, realm, since, they, did, not, have, a, native, tradition, of, kingship, however, costambeys, et, al, note, in, the, carolingian, world, that, since, saxony, had, not, been, in, the, roman, empire, it, is, hard, to, see, on, what, basis, an, emperor, would, have, been, any, more, welcomed, these, authors, write, that, the, decision, to, take, the, title, of, emperor, was, aimed, at, furthering, charlemagne, s, influence, in, italy, as, an, appeal, to, traditional, authority, recognised, by, italian, elites, within, and, especially, outside, his, control, collins, also, writes, that, becoming, emperor, gave, charlemagne, the, right, to, try, to, impose, his, rule, over, the, whole, of, considering, this, a, motivation, for, the, coronation, he, notes, the, element, of, political, and, military, risk, inherent, in, the, affair, due, to, the, opposition, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, potential, opposition, from, the, frankish, elite, as, the, imperial, title, could, draw, him, further, into, mediterranean, politics, collins, sees, several, of, charlemagne, s, actions, as, attempts, to, ensure, that, his, new, title, had, a, distinctly, frankish, context, charlemagne, s, coronation, led, to, a, centuries, long, ideological, conflict, between, his, successors, and, constantinople, known, as, the, problem, of, two, emperors, which, could, be, seen, as, a, rejection, or, usurpation, of, the, byzantine, emperors, claim, to, be, the, universal, preeminent, rulers, of, christendom, historian, james, muldoon, writes, that, charlemagne, may, have, had, a, more, limited, view, of, his, role, seeing, the, title, as, representing, dominion, over, lands, he, already, ruled, however, the, title, of, emperor, gave, charlemagne, enhanced, prestige, and, ideological, authority, he, immediately, incorporated, his, new, title, into, documents, he, issued, adopting, the, formula, charles, most, serene, augustus, crowned, by, god, great, peaceful, emperor, governing, the, roman, empire, and, who, is, by, the, mercy, of, god, king, of, the, franks, and, the, lombards, instead, of, the, earlier, form, charles, by, the, grace, of, god, king, of, the, franks, and, lombards, and, patrician, of, the, romans, leo, acclaimed, charlemagne, as, emperor, of, the, romans, during, the, coronation, but, charlemagne, never, used, this, title, the, avoidance, of, the, specific, claim, of, being, a, roman, emperor, as, opposed, to, the, more, neutral, emperor, governing, the, roman, empire, may, have, been, to, improve, relations, with, the, byzantines, this, formulation, with, the, continuation, of, his, earlier, royal, titles, may, also, represent, a, view, of, his, role, as, emperor, as, being, the, ruler, of, the, people, of, the, city, of, rome, as, he, was, of, the, franks, and, the, lombards, charlemagne, left, italy, in, the, summer, of, 801, after, adjudicating, several, ecclesiastical, disputes, in, rome, and, experiencing, an, earthquake, in, spoleto, he, never, returned, to, the, city, continuing, trends, and, a, ruling, style, established, in, the, 790s, charlemagne, s, reign, from, 801, onward, is, a, distinct, phase, characterised, by, more, sedentary, rule, from, aachen, although, conflict, continued, until, the, end, of, his, reign, the, relative, peace, of, the, imperial, period, allowed, for, attention, on, internal, governance, the, franks, continued, to, wage, war, though, these, wars, were, defending, and, securing, the, empire, s, frontiers, and, charlemagne, rarely, led, armies, personally, a, significant, expansion, of, the, spanish, march, was, achieved, with, a, series, of, campaigns, by, louis, against, the, emirate, of, cordoba, culminating, in, the, 801, capture, of, barcelona, the, 802, capitulare, missorum, generale, was, an, expansive, piece, of, legislation, with, provisions, governing, the, conduct, of, royal, officials, and, requiring, that, all, free, men, take, an, oath, of, loyalty, to, charlemagne, the, capitulary, reformed, the, institution, of, the, missi, dominici, officials, who, would, now, be, assigned, in, pairs, a, cleric, and, a, lay, aristocrat, to, administer, justice, and, oversee, governance, in, defined, territories, the, emperor, also, ordered, the, revision, of, the, lombard, and, frankish, legal, codes, in, addition, to, the, missi, charlemagne, also, ruled, parts, of, the, empire, with, his, sons, as, sub, kings, although, pepin, and, louis, had, some, authority, as, kings, in, italy, and, aquitaine, charlemagne, had, the, ultimate, authority, and, directly, intervened, charles, their, elder, brother, had, been, given, lands, in, neustria, in, 789, or, 790, and, made, a, king, in, 800, the, 806, charter, divisio, regnorum, division, of, the, realm, set, the, terms, of, charlemagne, s, succession, charles, as, his, eldest, son, in, good, favour, was, given, the, largest, share, of, the, inheritance, rule, of, francia, saxony, nordgau, and, parts, of, alemannia, the, two, younger, sons, were, confirmed, in, their, kingdoms, and, gained, additional, territories, most, of, bavaria, and, alemmannia, was, given, to, pepin, and, provence, septimania, and, parts, of, burgundy, were, given, to, louis, charlemagne, did, not, address, the, inheritance, of, the, imperial, title, the, divisio, also, provided, that, if, any, of, the, brothers, predeceased, charlemagne, their, sons, would, inherit, their, share, peace, was, urged, among, his, descendants, after, his, coronation, charlemagne, sought, recognition, of, his, imperial, title, from, constantinople, several, delegations, were, exchanged, between, charlemagne, and, irene, in, 802, and, 803, according, to, the, contemporary, byzantine, chronicler, thophanes, charlemagne, made, an, offer, of, marriage, to, irene, which, she, was, close, to, accepting, irene, was, deposed, and, replaced, by, nikephoros, i, who, was, unwilling, to, recognise, charlemagne, as, emperor, the, two, empires, conflicted, over, control, of, the, adriatic, sea, especially, istria, and, veneto, several, times, during, nikephoros, reign, charlemagne, sent, envoys, to, constantinople, in, 810, to, make, peace, giving, up, his, claims, to, veneto, nikephoros, died, in, battle, before, the, envoys, could, leave, constantinople, but, his, son, in, law, and, successor, michael, i, confirmed, the, peace, sending, his, own, envoys, to, aachen, to, recognise, charlemagne, as, emperor, charlemagne, soon, issued, the, first, frankish, coins, bearing, his, imperial, title, although, papal, coins, minted, in, rome, had, used, the, title, as, early, as, 800, he, sent, envoys, and, initiated, diplomatic, contact, with, the, abbasid, caliph, harun, al, rashid, during, the, 790s, due, to, their, mutual, interest, in, spanish, affairs, as, an, early, sign, of, friendship, charlemagne, requested, an, elephant, as, a, gift, from, harun, harun, later, provided, an, elephant, named, abul, abbas, which, arrived, at, aachen, in, 802, harun, also, sought, to, undermine, charlemagne, s, relations, with, the, byzantines, with, whom, he, was, at, war, as, part, of, his, outreach, harun, gave, charlemagne, nominal, rule, of, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, and, other, gifts, according, to, einhard, charlemagne, zealously, strove, to, make, friendships, with, kings, beyond, the, seas, in, order, that, he, might, get, some, help, and, relief, to, the, christians, living, under, their, rule, a, surviving, administrative, document, the, basel, roll, shows, the, work, done, by, his, agents, in, palestine, in, furtherance, of, this, goal, harun, s, death, lead, to, a, succession, crisis, and, under, his, successors, churches, and, synagogues, were, destroyed, in, the, caliphate, unable, to, intervene, directly, charlemagne, sent, specially, minted, coins, and, arms, to, the, eastern, christians, to, defend, and, restore, their, churches, and, monasteries, the, coins, with, their, inscriptions, were, also, an, important, tool, of, imperial, propaganda, johannes, fried, writes, that, deteriorating, relations, with, baghdad, after, harun, s, death, may, have, been, the, impetus, for, renewed, negotiations, with, constantinople, which, led, to, charlemagne, s, peace, with, michael, in, 811, as, emperor, charlemagne, became, involved, in, a, religious, dispute, between, eastern, and, western, christians, over, the, recitation, of, the, niceno, constantinopolitan, creed, the, fundamental, statement, of, orthodox, christian, belief, the, original, text, of, the, creed, adopted, at, the, council, of, constantinople, professed, that, the, holy, spirit, proceeded, from, the, father, a, tradition, developed, in, western, europe, that, the, holy, spirit, proceeded, from, the, father, and, the, son, inserting, the, latin, term, filioque, into, the, creed, the, difference, did, not, cause, significant, conflict, until, 807, when, frankish, monks, in, bethlehem, were, denounced, as, heretics, by, a, greek, monk, for, using, the, filioque, form, the, frankish, monks, appealed, the, dispute, to, rome, where, pope, leo, affirmed, the, text, of, the, creed, omitting, the, phrase, and, passed, the, report, on, to, charlemagne, charlemagne, summoned, a, council, at, aachen, in, 809, which, defended, the, use, of, filioque, and, sent, the, decision, to, rome, leo, said, that, the, franks, could, maintain, their, tradition, but, asserted, that, the, canonical, creed, did, not, include, filioque, he, commissioned, two, silver, shields, with, the, creed, in, latin, and, greek, omitting, the, filioque, which, he, hung, in, st, peter, s, basilica, another, product, of, the, 809, aachen, council, was, the, handbook, of, 809, an, illustrated, calendrical, and, astronomical, compendium, scandinavia, had, been, brought, into, contact, with, the, frankish, world, through, charlemagne, s, wars, with, the, saxons, raids, on, charlemagne, s, lands, by, the, danes, began, around, 800, charlemagne, engaged, in, his, final, campaign, in, saxony, in, 804, seizing, saxon, territory, east, of, the, elbe, removing, its, saxon, population, and, giving, the, land, to, his, obotrite, allies, the, danish, king, gudfred, uneasy, at, the, extension, of, frankish, power, offered, to, meet, with, charlemagne, to, arrange, peace, and, possibly, hand, over, saxons, who, had, fled, to, him, the, talks, were, unsuccessful, the, northern, frontier, was, quiet, until, 808, when, gudfred, and, some, allied, slavic, tribes, led, an, incursion, into, the, obotrite, lands, and, extracted, tribute, from, over, half, the, territory, charles, the, younger, led, an, army, across, the, elbe, in, response, but, only, attacked, some, of, gudfred, s, slavic, allies, gudfred, again, attempted, diplomatic, overtures, in, 809, but, no, peace, was, apparently, made, danish, pirates, raided, frisia, in, 810, although, it, is, uncertain, if, they, were, connected, to, gudfred, charlemagne, sent, an, army, to, secure, frisia, while, he, led, a, force, against, gudfred, who, had, reportedly, challenged, the, emperor, to, face, him, in, battle, the, battle, never, took, place, since, gudfred, was, murdered, by, two, of, his, own, men, before, charlemagne, s, arrival, gudfred, s, nephew, and, successor, hemming, immediately, sued, for, peace, and, a, commission, led, by, charlemagne, s, cousin, wala, reached, a, settlement, with, the, danes, in, 811, the, danes, did, not, pose, a, threat, for, the, remainder, of, charlemagne, s, reign, but, the, effects, of, this, war, and, their,

children, and, his, grandchildren, einhard, possibly, relying, on, tropes, from, suetonius, s, the, twelve, caesars, says, that, charlemagne, viewed, the, deaths, of, his, family, members, his, fall, from, a, horse, astronomical, phenomena, and, the, collapse, of, part, of, the, palace, in, his, last, years, as, signs, of, his, impending, death, charlemagne, continued, to, govern, with, energy, during, his, final, year, ordering, bishops, to, assemble, in, five, ecclesiastical, councils, these, culminated, in, a, large, assembly, at, aachen, where, charlemagne, crowned, louis, as, his, co, emperor, and, bernard, as, king, in, a, ceremony, on, 11, september, 813, charlemagne, became, ill, in, the, autumn, of, 813, and, spent, his, last, months, praying, fasting, and, studying, the,

west, east, and, middle, francia, by, the, treaty, of, verdun, middle, francia, was, divided, several, more, times, over, the, course, of, subsequent, generations, carolingians, would, rule, with, some, interruptions, in, east, francia, later, the, kingdom, of, germany, until, 911, and, in, west, francia, which, would, become, france, until, 987, after, 887, the, imperial, title, was, held,

empire, which, would, last, until, its, dissolution, in, 1806, during, the, napoleonic, wars, according, to, historian, jennifer, davis, charlemagne, invented, medieval, rulership, and, his, influence, can, be, seen, at, least, into, the, nineteenth, century, charlemagne, is, often, known, as, the, father, of, europe, because, of, the, influence, of, his, reign, and, the, legacy, he, left, across, the, large, area, of, the, continent, he, ruled, the, political, structures, he, established, remained, in, place, through, his, carolingian, successors, and, continued, to, exert, influence, into, the, eleventh, century, charlemagne, was, an, ancestor, of, several, european, ruling, houses, including, the, capetian, dynasty, the, ottonian, dynasty, the, house, of, luxembourg, and, the, house, of, ivrea, the, ottonians, and, capetians, direct, successors, of, the, carolingans, drew, on, the, legacy, of, charlemagne, to, bolster, their, legitimacy, and, prestige, the,

descendant, of, charlemagne, was, seen, as, a, sign, of, increased, legitimacy, for, their, son, louis, viii, and, the, french, kings, association, with, charlemagne, s, legacy, was, stressed, until, the, monarchy, s, end, german, and, french, rulers, such, as, frederick, barbarossa, and, napoleon, cited, the, influence, of, charlemagne, and, associated, themselves, with, him, in, fact, both, german, and, french, monarchs, considered, themselves, as, successors, of, charlemagne, enumerating, him, as, charles, i, in, their, regnal, lists, the, city, of, aachen, has, since, 1949, awarded, an, international, prize, the, karlspreis, der, stadt, aachen, in, honour, of, charlemagne, it, is, awarded, annually, to, those, who, promote, european, unity, recipients, of, the, prize, include, richard, von, coudenhove, kalergi, founder, of, the, pan, european, movement, alcide, de, gasperi, and, winston, churchill, contacts, with, the, wider, mediterranean, world, through, spain, and, italy, the, influx, of, foreign, scholars, at, court, and, the, relative, stability, and, length, of, charlemagne, s, reign, led, to, a, cultural, revival, known, as, the, carolingian, renaissance, although, the, beginnings, of, this, revival, can, be, seen, under, his, predecessors, charles, martel, and, pepin, charlemagne, took, an, active, and, direct, role, in, shaping, intellectual, life, which, led, to, the, revival, s, zenith, charlemagne, promoted, learning, as, a, matter, of, policy, and, direct, patronage, with, the, aim, of, creating, a, more, effective, clergy, the, admonitio,

and, modern, typefaces, scholar, john, j, contreni, considers, the, educational, and, learning, revival, under, charlemagne, and, his, successors, one, of, the, most, durable, and, resilient, elements, of, the, carolingian, legacy, charlemagne, was, a, frequent, subject, of, and, inspiration, for, medieval, writers, after, his, death, einhard, s, vita, karoli, magni, according, to, johannes, fired, can, be, said, to, have, revived, the, defunct, literary, genre, of, the, secular, biography, einhard, drew, on, classical, sources, such, as, suetonius, the, twelve, caesars, the, orations, of, cicero, and, tacitus, agricola, to, frame, his, work, s, structure, and, style, the, carolingian, period, also, saw, a, revival, of, the, mirrors, for, princes, genre, the, author, of, the, latin, poem, visio, karoli, magni, written, c, 865, uses, facts, apparently, from, einhard, and, his, own, observations, on, the, decline, of, charlemagne, s, family, after, their, civil, wars, later, in, the, ninth, century, as, the, bases, of, a, visionary, tale, about, charles, meeting, a, prophetic, spectre, in, a, dream, notker, s, gesta, karoli, magni, written, for, charlemagne, s, great, grandson, charles, the, fat, presents, moral, anecdotes, exempla, to, highlight, the, emperor, s, qualities, as, a, ruler, charlemagne, as, a, figure, of, myth, and, emulation, grew, over, the, centuries, matthias, becher, writes, that, over, 1, 000, legends, are, recorded, about, him, far, outstripping, subsequent, emperors, and, kings, later, medieval, writers, depicted, charlemagne, as, a, crusader, and, christian, warrior, charlemagne, is, the, main, figure, of, the, medieval, literary, cycle, known, as, the, matter, of, france, works, in, this, cycle, which, originated, during, the, crusades, centre, on, characterizations, of, the, emperor, as, a, leader, of, christian, knights, in, wars, against, muslims, the, cycle, includes, chansons, de, geste, epic, poems, such, as, the, song, of, roland, and, chronicles, such, as, the, historia, caroli, magni, also, known, as, the, pseudo, turpin, chronicle, charlemagne, was, depicted, as, one, of, the, nine, worthies, a, fixture, in, medieval, literature, and, art, as, an, exemplar, of, a, christian, king, despite, his, central, role, in, these, legends, author, thomas, bulfinch, noted, that, romancers, represent, him, as, often, weak, and, passionate, the, victim, of, treacherous, counsellors, and, at, the, mercy, of, turbulent, barons, on, whose, prowess, he, depends, for, the, maintenance, of, his, throne, attention, to, charlemagne, became, more, scholarly, in, the, early, modern, period, as, eindhard, s, vita, and, other, sources, began, to, be, published, political, philosophers, debated, his, legacy, montesquieu, viewed, him, as, the, first, constitutional, monarch, and, protector, of, freemen, but, voltaire, saw, him, as, a, despotic, ruler, and, representative, of, the, medieval, period, as, a, dark, age, as, early, as, the, sixteenth, century, debate, between, german, and, french, writers, began, about, charlemagne, s, nationality, these, contrasting, portraits, a, french, charlemagne, versus, a, german, karl, der, gro, e, became, especially, pronounced, during, the, nineteenth, century, with, napoleon, s, use, of, charlemagne, s, legacy, and, the, rise, of, german, nationalism, german, historiography, and, popular, perception, focused, on, the, massacre, of, verden, emphasized, with, charlemagne, as, the, butcher, of, the, germanic, saxons, or, downplayed, as, an, unfortunate, part, of, the, legacy, of, a, great, german, ruler, propaganda, in, nazi, germany, initially, portrayed, charlemagne, as, an, enemy, of, germany, a, french, ruler, who, worked, to, take, away, the, freedom, and, native, religion, of, the, german, people, this, quickly, shifted, as, adolf, hitler, endorsed, a, portrait, of, charlemagne, as, a, great, unifier, of, disparate, german, tribes, into, a, common, nation, allowing, hitler, to, co, opt, charlemagne, s, legacy, as, an, ideological, model, for, his, expansionist, policies, historiography, after, world, war, ii, focused, on, charlemagne, as, the, father, of, europe, rather, than, a, nationalistic, figure, a, view, first, advanced, during, the, nineteenth, century, by, german, romantic, philosopher, friedrich, schlegel, this, view, has, led, to, charlemagne, s, adoption, as, a, political, symbol, of, european, integration, modern, historians, increasingly, place, charlemagne, in, the, context, of, the, wider, mediterranean, world, following, the, work, of, henri, pirenne, charlemagne, gave, much, attention, to, religious, and, ecclesiastical, affairs, holding, 23, synods, during, his, reign, his, synods, were, called, to, address, specific, issues, at, particular, times, but, generally, dealt, with, church, administration, and, organization, education, of, the, clergy, and, the, proper, forms, of, liturgy, and, worship, charlemagne, used, the, christian, faith, as, a, unifying, factor, in, the, realm, and, in, turn, worked, to, impose, unity, on, the, church, he, implemented, an, edited, version, of, the, dionysio, hadriana, book, of, canon, law, acquired, from, pope, adrian, required, use, of, the, rule, of, st, benedict, in, monasteries, throughout, the, empire, and, promoted, a, standardised, liturgy, adapted, from, the, rites, of, the, roman, church, to, conform, with, frankish, practices, carolingian, policies, promoting, unity, did, not, eliminate, the, diverse, practices, throughout, the, empire, but, created, a, shared, ecclesiastical, identity, according, to, rosamond, mckitterick, unison, not, unity, the, condition, of, all, his, subjects, as, a, christian, people, was, an, important, concern, charlemagne, s, policies, encouraged, preaching, to, the, laity, particularly, in, vernacular, languages, they, would, understand, he, believed, it, essential, to, be, able, to, recite, the, lord, s, prayer, and, the, apostles, creed, and, made, efforts, to, ensure, that, the, clergy, taught, them, and, other, basics, of, christian, morality, thomas, f, x, noble, writes, that, the, efforts, of, charlemagne, and, his, successors, to, standardise, christian, doctrine, and, practices, and, harmonise, frankish, practices, were, essential, steps, in, the, development, of, christianity, in, europe, and, the, roman, catholic, or, latin, church, as, a, historical, phenomenon, not, as, a, theological, or, ecclesiological, one, is, a, carolingian, construction, he, says, that, the, medieval, european, concept, of, christendom, as, an, overarching, community, of, western, christians, rather, than, a, collection, of, local, traditions, is, the, result, of, carolingian, policies, and, ideology, charlemagne, s, doctrinal, policies, promoting, the, use, of, filioque, and, opposing, the, second, council, of, nicea, were, key, steps, in, the, growing, divide, between, western, and, eastern, christianity, emperor, otto, ii, attempted, to, have, charlemagne, canonised, in, 1000, in, 1165, frederick, barbarossa, persuaded, antipope, paschal, iii, to, elevate, charlemagne, to, sainthood, since, paschal, s, acts, were, not, considered, valid, charlemagne, was, not, recognised, as, a, saint, by, the, holy, see, despite, this, lack, of, official, recognition, his, cult, was, observed, in, aachen, reims, frankfurt, zurich, and, regensburg, and, he, has, been, venerated, in, france, since, the, reign, of, charles, v, charlemagne, also, drew, attention, from, figures, of, the, protestant, reformation, with, martin, luther, criticising, his, apparent, subjugation, to, the, papacy, by, accepting, his, coronation, from, leo, john, calvin, and, other, protestant, thinkers, viewed, him, as, a, forerunner, of, the, reformation, however, noting, the, libri, carolini, s, condemnation, of, the, worship, of, images, and, relics, and, conflicts, by, charlemagne, and, his, successors, with, the, temporal, power, of, the, popes, wives, and, their, children, concubines, and, their, children, charlemagne, had, at, least, twenty, children, with, his, wives, and, other, partners, after, the, death, of, his, wife, luitgard, in, 800, he, did, not, remarry, but, had, children, with, unmarried, partners, he, was, determined, that, all, his, children, including, his, daughters, should, receive, an, education, in, the, liberal, arts, his, children, were, taught, in, accordance, with, their, aristocratic, status, which, included, training, in, riding, and, weaponry, for, his, sons, and, embroidery, spinning, and, weaving, for, his, daughters, rosamond, mckitterick, writes, that, charlemagne, exercised, a, remarkable, degree, of, patriarchal, control, over, his, progeny, noting, that, only, a, handful, of, his, children, and, grandchildren, were, raised, outside, his, court, pepin, of, italy, and, louis, reigned, as, kings, from, childhood, and, lived, at, their, courts, careers, in, the, church, were, arranged, for, his, illegitimate, sons, his, daughters, were, resident, at, court, or, at, chelles, abbey, where, charlemagne, s, sister, was, abbess, and, those, at, court, may, have, fulfilled, the, duties, of, queen, after, 800, louis, and, pepin, of, italy, married, and, had, children, during, their, father, s, lifetime, and, charlemagne, brought, pepin, s, daughters, into, his, household, after, pepin, s, death, rotrude, had, been, betrothed, to, emperor, constantine, vi, but, the, betrothal, was, ended, none, of, charlemagne, s, daughters, married, although, several, had, children, with, unmarried, partners, bertha, had, two, sons, nithard, and, hartnid, with, charlemagne, s, courtier, angilbert, rotrude, had, a, son, named, louis, possibly, with, count, rorgon, and, hiltrude, had, a, son, named, richbod, possibly, with, a, count, named, richwin, the, divisio, regnorum, issued, by, charlemagne, in, 806, provided, that, his, legitimate, daughters, be, allowed, to, marry, or, become, nuns, after, his, death, theodrada, entered, a, convent, but, the, decisions, of, his, other, daughters, are, unknown, einhard, gives, a, first, hand, description, of, charlemagne, s, appearance, later, in, life, he, was, heavily, built, sturdy, and, of, considerable, stature, although, not, exceptionally, so, since, his, height, was, seven, times, the, length, of, his, own, foot, he, had, a, round, head, large, and, lively, eyes, a, slightly, larger, nose, than, usual, white, but, still, attractive, hair, a, bright, and, cheerful, expression, a, short, and, fat, neck, and, he, enjoyed, good, health, except, for, the, fevers, that, affected, him, in, the, last, few, years, of, his, life, charlemagne, s, tomb, was, opened, in, 1861, by, scientists, who, reconstructed, his, skeleton, and, measured, it, at, 1, 92, metres, 6, ft, 4, in, in, length, roughly, equivalent, to, einhard, s, seven, feet, a, 2010, estimate, of, his, height, from, an, x, ray, and, ct, scan, of, his, tibia, was, 1, 84, metres, 6, ft, 0, in, this, puts, him, in, the, 99th, percentile, of, height, for, his, period, given, that, average, male, height, of, his, time, was, 1, 69, metres, 5, ft, 7, in, the, width, of, the, bone, suggested, that, he, was, slim, charlemagne, wore, his, hair, short, abandoning, the, merovingian, tradition, of, long, haired, monarchs, he, had, a, moustache, possibly, imitating, the, ostrogothic, king, theoderic, the, great, in, contrast, with, the, bearded, merovingian, kings, future, carolingian, monarchs, would, adopt, this, style, paul, dutton, notes, the, ubiquitous, crown, in, portraits, of, charlemagne, and, other, carolingian, rulers, replacing, the, earlier, merovingian, long, hair, a, ninth, century, statuette, depicts, charlemagne, or, his, grandson, charles, the, bald, and, shows, the, subject, as, moustachioed, with, short, hair, this, also, appears, on, contemporary, coinage, by, the, twelfth, century, charlemagne, was, described, as, bearded, rather, than, moustachioed, in, literary, sources, such, as, the, song, of, roland, the, pseudo, turpin, chronicle, and, other, works, in, latin, french, and, german, the, pseudo, turpin, uniquely, says, that, his, hair, was, brown, later, art, and, iconography, of, charlemagne, followed, suit,
