franks, and, co, emperor, with, his, father, charlemagne, from, 813, he, was, also, king, of, aquitaine, from, 781, as, the, only, surviving, son, of, charlemagne, and, hildegard, he, became, the, sole, ruler, of, the, franks, after, his, father, s, death, in, 814, a, position, that, he, held, until, his, death, except, from, november, 833, to, march, 834, when, he, was, deposed, during, his, reign, in, aquitaine, louis, was, charged, with, the, defence, of, the, empire, s, southwestern, frontier, he, conquered, barcelona, from, the, emirate, of, c, rdoba, in, 801, and, asserted, frankish, authority, over, pamplona, and, the, basques, south, of, the, pyrenees, in, 812, as, emperor, he, included, his, adult, sons, lothair, pepin, and, louis, in, the, government, and, sought, to, establish, a, suitable, division, of, the, realm, among, them, the, first, decade, of, his, reign, was, characterised, by, several, tragedies, and, embarrassments, notably, the, brutal, treatment, of, his, nephew, bernard, of, italy, for, which, louis, atoned, in, a, public, act, of, self, debasement, in, the, 830s, his, empire, was, torn, by, civil, war, between, his, sons, that, was, only, exacerbated, by, louis, s, attempts, to, include, his, son, charles, by, his, second, wife, in, the, succession, plans, though, his, reign, ended, on, a, high, note, with, order, largely, restored, to, his, empire, it, was, followed, by, three, years, of, civil, war, louis, is, generally, compared, unfavourably, to, his, father, but, faced, distinctly, different, problems, louis, was, born, in, 778, while, his, father, charlemagne, was, on, campaign, in, spain, at, the, carolingian, villa, of, cassinogilum, according, to, einhard, and, the, anonymous, chronicler, called, astronomus, the, place, is, usually, identified, with, chasseneuil, near, poitiers, he, was, the, third, son, of, charlemagne, by, his, wife, hildegard, he, had, a, twin, brother, named, lothair, who, died, young, louis, and, lothair, were, given, names, from, the, old, merovingian, dynasty, possibly, to, suggest, a, connection, louis, was, crowned, king, of, aquitaine, as, a, three, year, old, child, in, 781, in, the, following, year, he, was, sent, to, aquitaine, accompanied, by, regents, and, a, court, charlemagne, constituted, this, sub, kingdom, in, order, to, secure, the, border, of, his, realm, after, the, destructive, war, against, the, aquitanians, and, basques, under, waifar, capitulated, c, 768, and, later, hunald, ii, which, culminated, in, the, disastrous, battle, of, roncesvalles, 778, charlemagne, wanted, louis, to, grow, up, in, the, area, where, he, was, to, reign, however, wary, of, the, customs, his, son, may, have, been, assimilating, into, in, aquitaine, charlemagne, who, had, remarried, to, fastrada, after, the, death, of, hildegard, sent, for, louis, in, 785, louis, presented, himself, in, saxony, at, the, royal, council, of, paderborn, dressed, in, basque, costumes, along, with, other, youths, in, the, same, garment, which, may, have, made, a, good, impression, in, toulouse, since, the, basques, of, vasconia, were, a, mainstay, of, the, aquitanian, army, in, 794, charlemagne, gave, four, former, gallo, roman, villas, to, louis, in, the, thought, that, he, would, take, in, each, in, turn, as, winter, residence, dou, ebreuil, angeac, and, the, chasseneuil, charlemagne, s, intention, was, to, see, all, his, sons, brought, up, as, natives, of, their, given, territories, wearing, the, national, costume, of, the, region, and, ruling, by, the, local, customs, thus, were, the, children, sent, to, their, respective, realms, at, a, young, age, the, marches, peripheral, principalities, played, a, vital, role, as, bulwarks, against, exterior, threats, to, the, empire, louis, reigned, over, the, spanish, march, in, 797, barcelona, the, largest, city, of, the, marca, fell, to, the, franks, when, zeid, its, governor, rebelled, against, c, rdoba, and, failing, handed, it, to, them, the, c, rdoban, authority, recaptured, it, in, 799, however, louis, marched, the, entire, army, of, his, kingdom, including, gascons, with, their, duke, sancho, i, of, gascony, proven, als, under, leibulf, and, goths, under, bera, over, the, pyrenees, and, besieged, it, for, seven, months, wintering, there, from, 800, to, 801, when, it, capitulated, king, louis, was, formally, invested, with, his, armour, in, 791, at, the, age, of, fourteen, however, the, princes, were, not, given, independence, from, central, authority, as, charlemagne, wished, to, implant, in, them, the, concepts, of, empire, and, unity, by, sending, them, on, remote, military, expeditions, louis, joined, his, brother, pippin, at, the, mezzogiorno, campaign, in, italy, against, the, duke, grimoald, of, benevento, at, least, once, louis, was, one, of, charlemagne, s, three, legitimate, sons, to, survive, infancy, his, twin, brother, lothair, died, during, infancy, according, to, the, frankish, custom, of, partible, inheritance, louis, had, expected, to, share, his, inheritance, with, his, brothers, charles, the, younger, king, of, neustria, and, pepin, king, of, italy, in, the, divisio, regnorum, of, 806, charlemagne, had, slated, charles, the, younger, as, his, successor, as, ruler, of, the, frankish, heartland, of, neustria, and, austrasia, while, giving, pepin, the, iron, crown, of, lombardy, which, charlemagne, possessed, by, conquest, to, louis, s, kingdom, of, aquitaine, he, added, septimania, provence, and, part, of, burgundy, however, charlemagne, s, other, legitimate, sons, died, pepin, in, 810, and, charles, in, 811, and, louis, was, crowned, co, emperor, with, an, already, ailing, charlemagne, in, aachen, on, 11, september, 813, on, his, father, s, death, in, 814, he, inherited, the, entire, carolingian, empire, and, all, its, possessions, with, the, sole, exception, of, the, kingdom, of, italy, although, within, louis, s, empire, in, 813, charlemagne, had, ordered, that, bernard, pepin, s, son, be, made, and, called, king, while, at, his, palace, of, dou, anjou, louis, received, news, of, his, father, s, death, he, rushed, to, aachen, and, crowned, himself, emperor, to, shouts, of, vivat, imperator, ludovicus, by, the, attending, nobles, upon, arriving, at, the, imperial, court, in, aachen, in, an, atmosphere, of, suspicion, and, anxiety, on, both, sides, louis, s, first, act, was, to, purge, the, palace, of, what, he, considered, undesirable, he, destroyed, the, old, germanic, pagan, tokens, and, texts, which, had, been, collected, by, charlemagne, he, further, exiled, members, of, the, court, he, deemed, morally, dissolute, including, some, of, his, own, relatives, he, quickly, sent, all, of, his, many, unmarried, half, sisters, and, nieces, to, nunneries, in, order, to, avoid, any, possible, entanglements, from, overly, powerful, brothers, in, law, sparing, his, illegitimate, half, brothers, drogo, hugh, and, theoderic, he, forced, his, father, s, cousins, adalard, and, wala, to, be, tonsured, sending, them, into, monastic, exile, at, st, philibert, on, the, island, of, noirmoutier, and, corbie, respectively, despite, the, latter, s, initial, loyalty, he, made, bernard, margrave, of, septimania, and, ebbo, archbishop, of, reims, his, chief, counsellors, the, latter, born, a, serf, was, raised, by, louis, to, that, office, but, betrayed, him, later, he, retained, some, of, his, father, s, ministers, such, as, elisachar, abbot, of, st, maximin, near, trier, and, hildebold, archbishop, of, cologne, later, he, replaced, elisachar, with, hildwin, abbot, of, many, monasteries, he, also, employed, benedict, of, aniane, the, second, benedict, a, septimanian, visigoth, whom, he, made, abbot, of, the, newly, established, inden, monastery, at, aix, la, chapelle, and, charged, him, with, the, reform, of, the, frankish, church, one, of, benedict, s, primary, reforms, was, to, ensure, that, all, religious, houses, in, louis, s, realm, adhered, to, the, rule, of, saint, benedict, named, for, its, creator, benedict, of, nursia, from, the, start, of, his, reign, his, coinage, imitated, his, father, charlemagne, s, portrait, which, gave, it, an, image, of, imperial, authority, and, prestige, in, 816, pope, stephen, iv, who, had, succeeded, leo, iii, visited, reims, and, again, crowned, louis, on, sunday, 5, october, as, a, result, most, french, kings, were, crowned, in, reims, following, the, custom, established, by, louis, the, pious, on, 9, april, 817, maundy, thursday, louis, and, his, court, were, crossing, a, wooden, gallery, from, the, cathedral, to, the, palace, in, aachen, when, the, gallery, collapsed, killing, many, louis, having, barely, survived, and, feeling, the, imminent, danger, of, death, began, planning, for, his, succession, three, months, later, among, the, approval, of, his, aachen, court, and, the, clergy, he, issued, an, imperial, decree, of, eighteen, chapters, the, ordinatio, imperii, that, laid, out, plans, for, an, orderly, dynastic, succession, the, term, ordinatio, imperii, is, a, modern, 19th, century, creation, the, decree, is, called, divisio, imperii, in, the, only, surviving, contemporary, manuscript, in, 815, louis, had, already, given, his, two, eldest, sons, a, share, in, the, government, when, he, had, sent, his, elder, sons, lothair, and, pepin, to, govern, bavaria, and, aquitaine, respectively, though, without, the, royal, titles, he, proceeded, to, divide, the, empire, among, his, three, sons, if, one, of, the, subordinate, kings, died, he, was, to, be, succeeded, by, his, sons, if, he, died, childless, lothair, would, inherit, his, kingdom, in, the, event, of, lothair, dying, without, sons, one, of, louis, the, pious, s, younger, sons, would, be, chosen, to, replace, him, by, the, people, above, all, the, empire, would, not, be, divided, the, emperor, would, rule, supreme, over, the, subordinate, kings, whose, obedience, to, him, was, mandatory, with, this, settlement, louis, attempted, to, combine, his, sense, for, the, empire, s, unity, supported, by, the, clergy, while, at, the, same, time, providing, positions, for, all, of, his, sons, instead, of, treating, his, sons, equally, in, status, and, land, he, elevated, his, first, born, son, lothair, above, his, younger, brothers, and, gave, him, the, largest, part, of, the, empire, as, his, share, the, decree, failed, to, create, order, as, it, omitted, bernard, who, immediately, began, to, conspire, when, louis, began, to, issue, changes, in, favor, of, his, second, wife, judith, s, son, charles, the, bald, his, sons, lothar, pepin, and, louis, refused, to, accept, the, rule, of, sons, being, favoured, over, brothers, in, succession, remained, also, untouched, the, ordinatio, imperii, of, aachen, left, bernard, in, italy, in, an, uncertain, and, subordinate, position, as, king, of, italy, and, he, began, plotting, to, declare, independence, upon, hearing, of, this, louis, immediately, directed, his, army, towards, italy, and, headed, for, chalon, sur, sa, ne, intimidated, by, the, emperor, s, swift, action, bernard, met, his, uncle, at, chalon, under, invitation, and, surrendered, he, was, taken, to, aachen, by, louis, who, there, had, him, tried, and, condemned, to, death, for, treason, louis, had, the, sentence, commuted, to, blinding, which, was, duly, carried, out, bernard, did, not, survive, the, ordeal, however, dying, after, two, days, of, agony, others, also, suffered, theodulf, of, orl, ans, in, eclipse, since, the, death, of, charlemagne, was, accused, of, having, supported, the, rebellion, and, was, thrown, into, a, monastic, prison, dying, soon, afterwards, it, was, rumored, that, he, had, been, poisoned, the, fate, of, his, nephew, deeply, marked, louis, s, conscience, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 822, as, a, deeply, religious, man, louis, performed, penance, for, causing, bernard, s, death, at, his, palace, of, attigny, near, vouziers, in, the, ardennes, before, pope, paschal, i, and, a, council, of, clerics, and, nobles, of, the, realm, that, had, been, convened, for, the, reconciliation, of, louis, with, his, three, younger, half, brothers, hugo, whom, he, soon, made, abbot, of, st, quentin, drogo, whom, he, soon, made, bishop, of, metz, and, theodoric, this, act, of, contrition, partly, in, emulation, of, theodosius, i, had, the, effect, of, greatly, reducing, his, prestige, as, a, frankish, ruler, for, he, also, recited, a, list, of, minor, offences, about, which, no, secular, ruler, of, the, time, would, have, taken, any, notice, he, also, made, the, egregious, error, of, releasing, wala, and, adalard, from, their, monastic, confinements, placing, the, former, in, a, position, of, power, in, the, court, of, lothair, and, the, latter, in, a, position, in, his, own, house, at, the, start, of, louis, s, reign, the, many, tribes, danes, obotrites, slovenes, bretons, and, basques, which, inhabited, his, frontierlands, were, still, in, awe, of, the, frankish, emperor, s, power, and, dared, not, stir, up, any, trouble, in, 816, however, the, sorbs, rebelled, and, were, quickly, followed, by, slavomir, chief, of, the, obotrites, who, was, captured, and, abandoned, by, his, own, people, being, replaced, by, ceadrag, in, 818, soon, ceadrag, too, had, turned, against, the, franks, and, allied, with, the, danes, who, were, to, become, the, greatest, menace, of, the, franks, in, a, short, time, a, greater, slavic, menace, was, gathering, on, the, southeast, there, ljudevit, duke, of, slavs, in, lower, pannonia, was, harassing, the, border, at, the, drava, and, sava, rivers, the, margrave, of, friuli, cadolah, was, sent, out, against, him, but, he, died, on, campaign, and, in, 820, his, margravate, was, invaded, by, slovenes, in, 821, an, alliance, was, made, with, borna, duke, of, the, dalmatia, and, liudewit, was, brought, to, heel, in, 824, several, slav, tribes, in, the, north, western, parts, of, bulgaria, acknowledged, louis, s, suzerainty, and, after, he, was, reluctant, to, settle, the, matter, peacefully, with, the, bulgarian, ruler, omurtag, in, 827, the, bulgarians, attacked, the, franks, in, the, march, of, pannonia, and, regained, their, lands, on, the, far, southern, edge, of, his, great, realm, louis, had, to, control, the, lombard, princes, of, benevento, whom, charlemagne, had, never, subjugated, he, extracted, promises, from, princes, grimoald, iv, and, sico, but, to, no, effect, on, the, southwestern, frontier, problems, commenced, early, when, c, 812, louis, the, pious, crossed, the, western, pyrenees, to, settle, matters, in, pamplona, the, expedition, made, its, way, back, north, where, it, narrowly, escaped, an, ambush, attempt, arranged, by, the, basques, in, the, pass, of, roncevaux, thanks, to, the, precautions, he, took, i, e, hostages, s, guin, duke, of, gascony, was, then, deposed, by, louis, in, 816, possibly, for, failing, to, suppress, or, collaborating, with, the, basque, revolt, south, of, the, western, pyrenees, so, sparking, off, a, basque, uprising, that, was, duly, put, down, by, the, frankish, emperor, in, dax, seguin, was, replaced, by, lupus, iii, who, was, dispossessed, in, 818, by, the, emperor, in, 820, an, assembly, at, quierzy, sur, oise, decided, to, send, an, expedition, against, the, cordoban, caliphate, 827, the, counts, in, charge, of, the, army, hugh, count, of, tours, and, matfrid, count, of, orl, ans, were, slow, in, acting, and, the, expedition, came, to, naught, in, 818, as, louis, was, returning, from, a, campaign, to, brittany, he, was, greeted, by, news, of, the, death, of, his, wife, ermengarde, ermengarde, was, the, daughter, of, ingerman, the, duke, of, hesbaye, louis, had, been, close, to, his, wife, who, had, been, involved, in, policymaking, it, was, rumoured, that, she, had, played, a, part, in, her, nephew, s, death, and, louis, himself, believed, her, own, death, was, divine, retribution, for, that, event, it, took, many, months, for, his, courtiers, and, advisors, to, convince, him, to, remarry, but, eventually, he, did, in, 820, to, judith, daughter, of, welf, count, of, altdorf, in, 823, judith, gave, birth, to, a, son, who, was, named, charles, the, birth, of, this, son, damaged, the, partition, of, aachen, as, louis, s, attempts, to, provide, for, his, fourth, son, met, with, stiff, resistance, from, his, older, sons, and, the, last, two, decades, of, his, reign, were, marked, by, civil, war, at, worms, in, 829, louis, gave, alemannia, to, charles, with, the, title, of, king, or, duke, historians, differ, on, this, thus, enraging, his, son, and, co, emperor, lothair, whose, promised, share, was, thereby, diminished, an, insurrection, was, soon, at, hand, with, the, urging, of, the, vengeful, wala, and, the, cooperation, of, his, brothers, lothair, accused, judith, of, having, committed, adultery, with, bernard, of, septimania, even, suggesting, bernard, to, be, the, true, father, of, charles, ebbo, and, hildwin, abandoned, the, emperor, at, that, point, bernard, having, risen, to, greater, heights, than, either, of, them, agobard, archbishop, of, lyon, and, jesse, of, amiens, bishop, of, amiens, too, opposed, the, redivision, of, the, empire, and, lent, their, episcopal, prestige, to, the, rebels, in, 830, at, wala, s, insistence, that, bernard, of, septimania, was, plotting, against, him, pepin, of, aquitaine, led, an, army, of, gascons, with, the, support, of, the, neustrian, magnates, all, the, way, to, paris, at, verberie, louis, the, german, joined, him, at, that, time, the, emperor, returned, from, another, campaign, in, brittany, to, find, his, empire, at, war, with, itself, he, marched, as, far, as, compi, gne, an, ancient, royal, town, before, being, surrounded, by, pepin, s, forces, and, captured, judith, was, incarcerated, at, poitiers, and, bernard, fled, to, barcelona, then, lothair, finally, set, out, with, a, large, lombard, army, but, louis, had, promised, his, sons, louis, the, german, and, pepin, of, aquitaine, greater, shares, of, the, inheritance, prompting, them, to, shift, loyalties, in, favour, of, their, father, when, lothair, tried, to, call, a, general, council, of, the, realm, in, nijmegen, in, the, heart, of, austrasia, the, austrasians, and, rhinelanders, came, with, a, following, of, armed, retainers, and, the, disloyal, sons, were, forced, to, free, their, father, and, bow, at, his, feet, 831, lothair, was, pardoned, but, disgraced, and, banished, to, italy, pepin, returned, to, aquitaine, and, judith, after, being, forced, to, humiliate, herself, with, a, solemn, oath, of, innocence, to, louis, s, court, only, wala, was, severely, dealt, with, making, his, way, to, a, secluded, monastery, on, the, shores, of, lake, geneva, although, hilduin, abbot, of, saint, denis, was, exiled, to, paderborn, and, elisachar, and, matfrid, were, deprived, of, their, honours, north, of, the, alps, they, did, not, lose, their, freedom, the, next, revolt, occurred, a, mere, two, years, later, in, 832, the, disaffected, pepin, was, summoned, to, his, father, s, court, where, he, was, so, poorly, received, he, left, against, his, father, s, orders, immediately, fearing, that, pepin, would, be, stirred, up, to, revolt, by, his, nobles, and, desiring, to, reform, his, morals, louis, the, pious, summoned, all, his, forces, to, meet, in, aquitaine, in, preparation, of, an, uprising, but, louis, the, german, garnered, an, army, of, slav, allies, and, conquered, swabia, before, the, emperor, could, react, once, again, the, elder, louis, divided, his, vast, realm, at, jonac, he, declared, charles, king, of, aquitaine, and, deprived, pepin, he, was, less, harsh, with, the, younger, louis, restoring, the, whole, rest, of, the, empire, to, lothair, not, yet, involved, in, the, civil, war, lothair, was, however, interested, in, usurping, his, father, s, authority, his, ministers, had, been, in, contact, with, pepin, and, may, have, convinced, him, and, louis, the, german, to, rebel, promising, him, alemannia, the, kingdom, of, charles, soon, lothair, with, the, support, of, pope, gregory, iv, whom, he, had, confirmed, in, office, without, his, father, s, support, joined, the, revolt, in, 833, while, louis, was, at, worms, gathering, a, new, force, lothair, marched, north, louis, marched, south, the, armies, met, on, the, plains, of, the, rothfeld, there, gregory, met, the, emperor, and, may, have, tried, to, sow, dissension, amongst, his, ranks, soon, much, of, louis, s, army, had, evaporated, before, his, eyes, and, he, ordered, his, few, remaining, followers, to, go, because, it, would, be, a, pity, if, any, man, lost, his, life, or, limb, on, my, account, the, resigned, emperor, was, taken, to, saint, m, dard, de, soissons, his, son, charles, to, pr, m, and, the, queen, to, tortona, the, despicable, show, of, disloyalty, and, disingenuousness, earned, the, site, the, name, field, of, lies, or, l, genfeld, or, campus, mendacii, ubi, plurimorum, fidelitas, exstincta, est, on, 13, november, 833, ebbo, with, agobard, of, lyon, presided, over, a, synod, at, the, church, of, saint, medard, in, soissons, which, saw, louis, undertake, public, penance, for, the, second, time, in, his, reign, the, penitential, ritual, that, was, undertaken, began, when, louis, arrived, at, the, church, and, confessed, multiple, times, to, the, crimes, levied, against, him, the, crimes, had, been, historic, and, recent, with, accusations, of, oath, breaking, violation, of, the, public, peace, and, inability, to, control, his, adulterous, wife, judith, of, bavaria, afterwards, he, threw, his, sword, belt, at, the, base, of, the, altar, and, received, judgement, through, the, imposition, of, the, hands, of, the, bishops, louis, was, to, live, the, rest, of, his, life, as, a, penitent, never, to, hold, office, again, the, penance, divided, the, aristocracy, the, anonymous, biographer, of, the, vita, hludovici, criticized, the, whole, affair, on, the, basis, that, god, does, not, judge, twice, for, sins, committed, and, confessed, lothair, s, allies, were, generously, compensated, ebbo, himself, received, the, monastery, of, st, vaast, whilst, pepin, was, allowed, to, keep, the, lands, reclaimed, from, his, father, men, like, rabanus, maurus, louis, s, younger, half, brothers, drogo, and, hugh, and, emma, judith, s, sister, and, louis, the, german, s, new, wife, worked, on, the, younger, louis, to, make, peace, with, his, father, for, the, sake, of, unity, of, the, empire, the, humiliation, to, which, louis, was, then, subjected, at, notre, dame, in, compi, gne, turned, the, loyal, barons, of, austrasia, and, saxony, against, lothair, and, the, usurper, fled, to, burgundy, skirmishing, with,
