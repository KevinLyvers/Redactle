programs, for, street, children, cardinal, mastai, ferretti, was, considered, a, liberal, during, his, episcopate, in, spoleto, and, imola, because, he, supported, administrative, changes, in, the, papal, states, and, sympathized, with, the, nationalist, movement, in, italy, cardinal, mastai, ferretti, entered, the, papacy, in, 1846, amidst, widespread, expectations, that, he, would, be, a, champion, of, reform, and, modernization, in, the, papal, states, which, he, ruled, directly, and, in, the, entire, catholic, church, admirers, wanted, him, to, lead, the, battle, for, italian, independence, his, later, turn, toward, profound, conservatism, shocked, and, dismayed, his, original, supporters, while, surprising, and, delighting, the, conservative, old, guard, the, conclave, of, 1846, following, the, death, of, pope, gregory, xvi, 1831, 1846, took, place, in, an, unsettled, political, climate, within, italy, the, conclave, was, steeped, in, a, factional, division, between, right, and, left, the, conservatives, on, the, right, favoured, the, hardline, stances, and, papal, absolutism, of, the, previous, pontificate, while, liberals, supported, moderate, reforms, the, conservatives, supported, luigi, lambruschini, the, late, pope, s, cardinal, secretary, of, state, liberals, supported, two, candidates, pasquale, tommaso, gizzi, and, the, then, 54, year, old, mastai, ferretti, during, the, first, ballot, mastai, ferretti, received, 15, votes, the, rest, going, to, lambruschini, and, gizzi, lambruschini, received, a, majority, of, the, votes, in, the, early, ballots, but, failed, to, achieve, the, required, two, thirds, majority, gizzi, was, favoured, by, the, french, government, but, failed, to, get, further, support, from, the, cardinals, and, the, conclave, ended, up, ultimately, as, a, contest, between, lambruschini, and, mastai, ferretti, in, the, meantime, cardinal, tommaso, bernetti, reportedly, received, information, that, cardinal, karl, kajetan, von, gaisruck, the, austrian, archbishop, of, milan, was, on, his, way, to, the, conclave, to, veto, the, election, of, mastai, ferretti, on, behalf, of, the, austrian, empire, and, prince, metternich, according, to, historian, val, rie, pirie, bernetti, realized, that, he, had, only, a, few, hours, in, which, to, stop, lambruschini, s, election, faced, with, a, deadlock, and, urgently, persuaded, by, bernetti, to, reject, lambruschini, liberals, and, moderates, decided, to, cast, their, votes, for, mastai, ferretti, in, a, move, that, contradicted, the, general, mood, throughout, europe, on, the, evening, of, the, second, day, of, the, conclave, 16, june, 1846, mastai, ferretti, was, elected, pope, he, was, a, glamorous, candidate, ardent, emotional, with, a, gift, for, friendship, and, a, track, record, of, generosity, even, towards, anti, clericals, and, carbonari, he, was, a, patriot, known, to, be, critical, of, gregory, xvi, because, it, was, night, no, formal, announcement, was, given, just, the, signal, of, white, smoke, on, the, following, morning, the, cardinal, protodeacon, tommaso, riario, sforza, announced, the, election, of, mastai, ferretti, before, a, crowd, of, faithful, catholics, when, mastai, ferretti, appeared, on, the, balcony, the, mood, became, joyous, mastai, ferretti, chose, the, name, of, pius, ix, in, honour, of, pope, pius, vii, 1800, 1823, who, had, encouraged, his, vocation, to, the, priesthood, despite, his, childhood, epilepsy, however, the, new, pope, had, little, diplomatic, experience, and, no, curial, experience, at, all, pius, ix, was, crowned, on, 21, june, 1846, the, election, of, the, liberal, pius, ix, created, much, enthusiasm, in, europe, and, elsewhere, for, the, next, twenty, months, after, the, election, pius, ix, was, the, most, popular, man, on, the, italian, peninsula, where, the, exclamation, long, life, to, pius, ix, was, often, heard, english, protestants, celebrated, him, as, a, friend, of, light, and, a, reformer, of, europe, towards, freedom, and, progress, he, was, elected, without, secular, political, influences, and, in, the, full, vigor, of, life, he, was, pious, progressive, intellectual, decent, friendly, and, open, to, all, while, his, political, views, and, policies, were, hotly, debated, in, the, coming, years, his, personal, lifestyle, was, above, reproach, a, model, of, simplicity, and, poverty, in, everyday, affairs, the, most, notable, event, in, pius, ix, s, long, pontificate, was, the, end, of, the, papal, states, which, lay, in, the, middle, of, the, italian, boot, around, the, central, area, of, rome, in, contrast, he, led, the, worldwide, church, toward, an, ever, increasing, centralization, and, consolidation, of, power, in, rome, and, the, papacy, more, than, his, predecessors, pius, used, the, papal, pulpit, to, address, the, bishops, of, the, world, the, first, vatican, council, 1869, 1870, which, he, convened, to, consolidate, papal, authority, further, was, considered, a, milestone, not, only, in, his, pontificate, but, also, in, ecclesiastical, history, through, its, defining, of, the, dogma, of, papal, infallibility, after, the, first, vatican, council, concluded, an, emissary, of, the, roman, curia, was, dispatched, to, secure, the, signatures, of, patriarch, gregory, ii, youssef, and, the, rest, of, the, melkite, delegation, who, had, voted, non, placet, at, the, general, congregation, and, left, rome, prior, to, the, adoption, of, the, dogmatic, constitution, pastor, aeternus, on, papal, infallibility, gregory, and, the, melkite, bishops, ultimately, subscribed, to, it, but, added, the, qualifying, clause, used, at, the, council, of, florence, except, the, rights, and, privileges, of, eastern, patriarchs, this, earned, gregory, the, enmity, of, pius, ix, during, his, next, visit, to, the, pontiff, before, leaving, rome, when, gregory, was, kneeling, pius, placed, his, knee, on, the, patriarch, s, shoulder, just, saying, to, him, testa, dura, you, headstrong, in, spite, of, this, event, gregory, and, the, melkite, greek, catholic, church, remained, committed, to, their, union, with, the, holy, see, the, ecclesiastical, policies, of, pius, ix, were, dominated, by, defence, of, the, rights, of, the, church, and, the, free, exercise, of, religion, for, catholics, in, countries, such, as, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, he, also, fought, against, what, he, perceived, to, be, anti, catholic, philosophies, in, countries, such, as, italy, germany, and, france, the, german, empire, sought, to, restrict, and, weaken, the, church, for, a, decade, after, the, franco, prussian, war, pius, ix, celebrated, several, jubilees, including, the, 300th, anniversary, of, the,

000, lay, persons, in, rome, a, large, gathering, was, organized, in, 1871, to, commemorate, the, 25th, anniversary, of, his, papacy, though, the, italian, government, in, 1870, outlawed, many, popular, pilgrimages, the, faithful, of, bologna, organized, a, nationwide, spiritual, pilgrimage, to, the, pope, and, the, tombs, of, the, apostles, in, 1873, in, 1875, pius, declared, a, holy, year,

30, april, 1877, to, 15, june, 1877, he, was, a, bit, shy, but, he, valued, initiative, within, the, church, and, created, several, new, titles, rewards, and, orders, to, elevate, those, who, in, his, view, deserved, merit, pius, ix, created, 122, new, cardinals, of, whom, 64, were, alive, at, his, death, at, the, time, membership, in, the, college, of, cardinals, was, limited, to, 70, noteworthy,

that, gu, ranger, had, learned, that, pius, ix, wanted, to, name, him, a, cardinal, in, november, 1855, but, he, refused, the, honor, because, he, did, not, want, to, live, in, rome, as, a, result,

links, connected, the, papal, states, to, northern, italy, it, soon, became, apparent, that, the, northern, italians, were, more, adept, at, economically, exploiting, the, modern, means, of, communication, than, the, inhabitants, in, central, and, southern, italy, the, justice, system, of, the, papal, states, was, subject, to, much, criticism, not, unlike, the, justice, systems, in, the,

painting, sculpture, music, goldsmiths, coppersmiths, and, more, and, handed, out, numerous, rewards, to, artists, much, of, his, efforts, went, to, renovate, and, improve, churches, in, rome, and, the, papal, states, he, ordered, the, strengthening, of, the, colosseum, which, was, feared, to, be, on, the, verge, of, collapse, huge, sums, were, spent, in, the, excavation, of, the, christian, catacombs, of, rome, for, which, pius, created, a, new, archaeological, commission, in, 1853, the, papal, states, were, a, theocracy, in, which, the, catholic, church, and, its, members, had, far, more, rights, than, other, religions, pius, ix, s, religious, policies, became, increasingly, reactionary, over, time, at, the, beginning, of, his, pontificate, together, with, other, liberal, measures, pius, opened, up, the, jewish, ghetto, in, rome, freeing, jews, to, reside, elsewhere, in, 1850, after, french, troops, defeated, the, revolutionary, roman, republic, and, returned, him, from, exile, the, pope, reversed, the, republic, s, religious, freedom, laws, and, issued, a, series, of, anti, liberal, measures, including, re, instituting, the, jewish, ghetto, in, a, highly,

christians, from, being, raised, by, jews, even, their, own, parents, the, incident, provoked, widespread, outrage, amongst, liberals, both, catholic, and, non, catholic, and, contributed, to, the, growing, anti, papal, sentiment, in, europe, the, boy, was, raised, in, the, papal, household, and, was, eventually, ordained, a, priest, at, age, 21, pius, ix, was, the, last, pope, who, also, functioned, as, a, secular, ruler, and, the, monarch, of, the, papal, states, ruling, over, some, 3, million, subjects, from, 1846, to, 1870, when, the, newly, founded, kingdom, of, italy, seized, the, remaining, areas, of, the, papal, states, by, force, of, arms, contention, between, italy, and, the, papacy, was, only, resolved, legally, by, the, 1929, lateran, treaty, lateran, pacts, or, lateran, accords, between, the, kingdom, of, italy, under, mussolini, and, the, holy, see, the, latter, receiving, financial, compensation, for, the, loss, of, the, papal, states, and, recognition, of, the, vatican, city, state, as, the, sovereign, independent, territory, of, the, holy, see, though, he, was, well, aware, upon, his, accession, of, the, political, pressures, within, the, papal, states, pius, ix, s, first, act, was, a, general, amnesty, for, political, prisoners, despite, the, potential, consequences, the, freed, revolutionaries, resumed, their, previous, political, activities, and, his, concessions, only, provoked, greater, demands, as, patriotic, italian, groups, sought, not, only, a, constitutional, government, to, which, he, was, sympathetic, but, also, the, unification, of, italy, under, his, leadership, and, a, war, of, liberation, to, free, the, northern, italian, provinces, from, the, rule, of, catholic, austria, by, early, 1848, all, of, western, europe, began, to, be, convulsed, in, various, revolutionary, movements, the, pope, claiming, to, be, above, national, interests, refused, to, go, to, war, with, austria, which, reversed, pius, popularity, in, his, native, italy, in, a, calculated, well, prepared, move, prime, minister, rossi, was, assassinated, on, 15, november, 1848, and, in, the, days, following, the, swiss, guards, were, disarmed, making, the, pope, a, prisoner, in, his, palace, however, he, succeeded, in, escaping, rome, several, days, later, a, roman, republic, was, declared, in, february, 1849, pius, responded, from, his, exile, by, excommunicating, all, participants, after, the, suppression, of, the, republic, later, that, year, pius, appointed, a, conservative, government, of, three, cardinals, known, as, the, red, triumvirate, to, administer, the, papal, states, until, his, return, to, rome, in, april, 1850, he, visited, the, hospitals, to, comfort, the, wounded, and, sick, but, he, seemed, to, have, lost, both, his, liberal, tastes, and, his, confidence, in, the, romans, who, had, turned, against, him, in, 1848, pius, decided, to, move, his, residence, from, the, quirinal, palace, inside, rome, to, the, vatican, where, popes, have, lived, ever, since, after, defeating, the, papal, army, on, 18, september, 1860, at, the, battle, of, castelfidardo, and, on, 30, september, at, ancona, victor, emmanuel, ii, of, sardinia, took, all, the, papal, territories, except, latium, with, rome, and, took, the, title, king, of, italy, rome, itself, was, invaded, on, 20, september, 1870, after, a, few, hours, siege, italy, instituted, the, law, of, guarantees, 13, may, 1871, which, gave, the, pope, the, use, of, the, vatican, but, denied, him, sovereignty, over, this, territory, nevertheless, granting, him, the, right, to, send, and, receive, ambassadors, and, a, budget, of, 3, 25, million, lira, annually, pius, ix, officially, rejected, this, offer, encyclical, ubi, nos, 15, may, 1871, since, it, was, a, unilateral, decision, which, did, not, grant, the, papacy, international, recognition, and, could, be, changed, at, any, time, by, the, secular, parliament, pius, ix, refused, to, recognize, the, new, italian, kingdom, which, he, denounced, as, an, illegitimate, creation, of, revolution, he, excommunicated, the, nation, s, leaders, including, king, victor, emmanuel, ii, whom, he, denounced, as, forgetful, of, every, religious, principle, despising, every, right, trampling, upon, every, law, whose, reign, over, italy, was, therefore, a, sacrilegious, usurpation, in, response, to, the, upheavals, faced, by, the, papal, states, during, the, 1848, revolutions, the, mexican, government, offered, pope, pius, ix, asylum, which, the, pope, responded, to, by, considering, the, creation, of, a, mexican, cardinal, and, granting, an, award, to, president, jos, joaqu, n, de, herrera, with, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, s, military, intervention, in, mexico, and, establishment, of, the, second, mexican, empire, under, maximilian, i, in, 1864, the, church, sought, relief, from, a, friendly, government, after, the, anti, clerical, actions, of, benito, ju, rez, who, had, suspended, payment, on, foreign, debt, and, seized, ecclesial, property, pius, blessed, maximilian, and, his, wife, charlotte, of, belgium, before, they, set, off, for, mexico, to, begin, their, reign, but, the, friction, between, the, vatican, and, mexico, would, continue, with, the, new, emperor, when, maximilian, insisted, on, freedom, of, religion, which, pius, opposed, relations, with, the, vatican, would, only, be, resumed, when, maximilian, sent, the, recently, converted, american, catholic, priest, father, agustin, fischer, to, rome, as, his, envoy, contrary, to, fischer, s, reports, back, to, maximilian, the, negotiations, did, not, go, well, and, the, vatican, would, not, budge, maximilian, sent, his, wife, charlotte, to, europe, to, plead, with, napoleon, iii, against, the, withdrawal, of, french, troops, from, mexico, after, unsuccessful, meetings, with, napoleon, iii, charlotte, travelled, to, rome, to, plead, with, pius, in, 1866, as, the, days, passed, charlotte, s, mental, state, deteriorated, she, sought, refuge, with, the, pope, and, she, would, eat, and, drink, only, what, was, prepared, for, him, fearful, that, everything, else, might, be, poisoned, the, pope, though, alarmed, accommodated, her, and, even, agreed, to, let, her, stay, in, the, vatican, one, night, after, she, voiced, anxiety, about, her, safety, she, and, her, assistant, were, the, first, women, to, stay, the, night, inside, the, vatican, england, for, centuries, was, considered, missionary, territory, for, the, catholic, church, in, the, wake, of, catholic, emancipation, in, the, united, kingdom, which, included, all, of, ireland, pius, ix, changed, that, with, the, bull, universalis, ecclesiae, 29, september, 1850, he, re, established, the, catholic, hierarchy, in, england, and, wales, under, the, newly, appointed, archbishop, and, cardinal, nicholas, wiseman, with, 12, additional, episcopal, seats, southwark, hexham, beverley, liverpool, salford, shrewsbury, newport, clifton, plymouth, nottingham, birmingham, and, northampton, some, violent, street, protests, against, the, papal, aggression, resulted, in, the, passage, of, the, ecclesiastical, titles, act, 1851, which, forbade, any, catholic, bishop, to, use, an, episcopal, title, of, any, city, town, or, place, or, of, any, territory, or, district, under, any, designation, or, description, whatsoever, in, the, united, kingdom, the, law, was, never, enforced, and, was, repealed, twenty, years, later, pius, donated, money, to, ireland, during, the, great,

1853, pius, erected, the, archdiocese, of, utrecht, and, four, dioceses, in, haarlem, den, bosch, breda, and, roermond, under, it, as, in, england, this, resulted, in, a, brief, popular, outburst, of, anti, catholic, sentiment, traditionally, catholic, spain, offered, a, challenge, to, pius, ix, as, anti, clerical, governments, came, to, power, in, 1832, resulting, in, the, expulsion, of, religious, orders, the, closing, of, convents, catholic, schools, and, libraries, the, seizure, and, sale, of, churches, and, religious, properties, and, the, inability, of, the, church, to, fill, vacant, dioceses, in, 1851, pius, ix, concluded, a, concordat, with, queen, isabella, ii, stipulating, that, unsold, ecclesial, properties, were, to, be, returned, while, the, church, renounced, properties, that, had, already, passed, to, new, owners, this, flexibility, of, pius, led, to, spain, guaranteeing, the, freedom, of, the, church, in, religious, education, pope, pius, ix, approved, on, 7, february, 1847, the, unanimous, request, of, the, american, bishops, that, the, immaculate, conception, be, invoked, as, the, patroness, of, the, united, states, of, america, beginning, in, october, 1862, the, pope, began, sending, public, letters, to, catholic, leaders, in, the, united, states, calling, for, an, end, to, the, destructive, civil, war, according, to, historian, don, h, doyle, however, during, the, american, civil, war, the, pope, urged, american, bishops, to, call, for, peace, at, a, time, when, peace, meant, separation, and, privately, he, expressed, strong, sympathies, with, the, south, the, confederacy, sent, envoys, to, enlist, pio, nono, in, their, cause, and, came, away, boasting, the, most, powerful, pontiff, in, europe, had, recognized, the, confederacy, the, pope, said, nothing, to, refute, such, claims, the, vatican, never, recognized, the, confederate, states, of, america, or, sent, any, diplomats, to, it, however, in, 1863, the, pope, did, meet, privately, with, a, confederate, envoy, and, suggested, gradual, emancipation, a, letter, of, pius, ix, to, jefferson, davis, in, december, 1863, addressing, him, as, praesidi, foederatorum, americae, regionum, president, of, the, federated, regions, of, america, was, not, seen, as, recognition, of, the, confederacy, even, by, its, own, officials, confederate, secretary, of, state, judah, p, benjamin, interpreted, it, as, a, mere, inferential, recognition, unconnected, with, political, action, or, the, regular, establishment, of, diplomatic, relations, without, the, weight, of, formal, recognition, pius, ix, elevated, archbishop, john, mccloskey, of, new, york, as, the, first, american, to, the, college, of, cardinals, on, 15, march, 1875, pius, ix, increased, the, number, of, canadian, dioceses, from, four, to, 21, with, 1, 340, churches, and, 1, 620, priests, in, 1874, pius, ix, signed, concordats, with, spain, austria, tuscany, portugal, haiti, honduras,

state, in, its, internal, affairs, which, was, applauded, by, pius, ix, similar, to, other, countries, austria, hungary, had, significant, anti, catholic, political, movements, mainly, liberals, which, forced, the, emperor, franz, joseph, i, in, 1870, to, renounce, the, concordat, of, 1855, with, the, vatican, austria, had, already, in, 1866, nullified, several, of, its, sections, concerning, the, freedom, of, catholic, schools, and, prohibition, of, civil, marriages, after, diplomatic, approaches, failed, pius, responded, on, 7, march, 1874, with, the, encyclical, vix, dum, a, nobis, demanding, religious, freedom, and, freedom, of, education, despite, these, developments, there, was, no, equivalent, to, the, german, kulturkampf, in, austria, and, pius, created, new, dioceses, throughout, austria, hungary, in, germany, the, state, of, prussia, under, the, leadership, of, otto, von, bismarck, saw, catholicism, as, a, dangerous, foreign, influence, and, in, 1872, 1878, fought, hard, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, pope, and, the, bishops, after, years, of, struggle, in, the, kulturkampf, the, catholics, fought, back, by, mobilising, their, voters, in, prussia, and, in, germany, as, a, whole, after, pius, died, bismarck, came, to, terms, with, the, new, pope, leo, xiii, he, dropped, his, alliance, with, the, anti, catholic, liberals, and, instead, formed, a, political, coalition, with, the, catholic, centre, party, the, pontificate, of, pius, ix, began, in, 1847, with, an, accomodamento, a, generous, agreement, which, allowed, pius, to, fill, vacant, episcopal, sees, of, the, latin, rites, both, in, russia, specifically, the, baltic, countries, and, in, the, polish, provinces, of, russia, the, short, lived, freedoms, were, undermined, by, the, russian, orthodox, church, polish, political, aspirations, in, the, occupied, lands, and, the, tendency, of, imperial, russia, to, act, against, any, dissent, pius, first, tried, to, position, himself, in, the, middle, strongly, opposing, revolutionary, and, violent, opposition, against, the, russian, authorities, and, appealing, to, them, for, more, ecclesiastical, freedom, after, the, failure, of, the, polish, uprising, in, 1863, pius, sided, with, the, persecuted, poles, protesting, against, their, persecutions, and, infuriating, the, tsarist, government, to, the, point, that, all, catholic, dioceses, were, eliminated, by, 1870, pius, criticized, the, tsar, without, naming, him, for, expatriating, whole, communities, to, siberia, exiling, priests, condemning, them, to, labour, camps, and, abolishing, catholic, dioceses, he, pointed, to, siberian, villages, tounka, and, irkout, where, in, 1868, 150, catholic, priests, were, awaiting, death, several, times, during, his, pontificate, pius, ix, considered, moving, from, rome, on, 24, november, 1848, facing, a, rebellion, by, italian, nationalists, he, fled, to, gaeta, in, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, returning, in, 1850, on, 26, july, 1862, when, giuseppe, garibaldi, and, his, volunteers, marching, in, rome, were, stopped, at, aspromonte, pius, ix, asked, the, british, envoy, odo, russell, if, he, would, be, granted, political, asylum, in, england, after, the, italian, troops, had, marched, in, russell, assured, him, of, asylum, if, the, need, arose, but, said, that, he, was, sure, that, the, pope, s, fears, were, unfounded, in, 1870, after, the, capture, of, rome, and, the, suspension, of, the, first, vatican, council, otto, von, bismarck, confided, that, pius, ix, had, asked, whether, prussia, could, grant, him, asylum, bismarck, did, not, object, adding, it, would, be, very, useful, to, us, to, be, recognised, by, catholics, as, what, we, really, are, that, is, to, say, the, sole, power, now, existing, that, is, capable, of, protecting, the, head, of, their, church, but, the, king, wilhelm, i, will, not, consent, he, is, terribly, afraid, he, thinks, all, prussia, would, be, perverted, and, he, himself, would, be, obliged, to, become, a, catholic, i, told, him, however, that, if, the, pope, begged, for, asylum, he, could, not, refuse, it, pius, was, adamant, about, his, role, as, the, highest, teaching, authority, in, the, church, as, expressed, in, the, dogma, of, papal, infallibility, defined, by, the, first, vatican, council, in, 1870, marian, doctrines, featured, prominently, in, 19th, century, theology, especially, the, issue, of, the, immaculate, conception, of, mary, during, his, pontificate, petitions, increased, requesting, the, dogmatization, of, the, immaculate, conception, in, 1848, pius, appointed, a, theological, commission, to, analyse, the, possibility, for, a, marian, dogma, on, 8, december, 1854, he, promulgated, the, apostolic, constitution, ineffabilis, deus, defining, the, dogma, of, the, immaculate, conception, of, the, blessed, virgin, mary, pius, issued, a, record, 38, encyclicals, they, include, unlike, popes, in, the, 20th, century, pius, ix, did, not, use, encyclicals, to, explain, the, faith, but, to, condemn, what, he, considered, errors, he, was, the, first, pope, to, popularize, encyclicals, on, a, large, scale, to, foster, his, views, after, prior, consultation, of, the, hierarchy, in, ubi, primum, see, above, pius, decisively, acted, on, the, century, old, disagreement, between, dominicans, and, franciscans, regarding, the, immaculate, conception, of, mary, deciding, in, favour, of, the, franciscan, view, however, his, defining, this, infallible, dogma, raised, a, question, can, a, pope, make, such, decisions, without, the, authority, of, the, bishops, this, doctrine, of, papal, infallibility, enhancing, the, role, of, the, papacy, and, decreasing, the, role, of, the, bishops, became, a, topic, of, the, first, vatican, council, convened, in, 1869, pius, ix, approved, 74, new, religious, congregations, for, women, alone, in, france, he, created, over, 200, new, dioceses, and, created, new, hierarchies, in, several, countries, he, supported, catholic, associations, such, as, the, ambrosian, circle, in, italy, the, union, of, catholic, workers, in, france, and, the, pius, verein, and, the, deutsche, katholische, gesellschaft, in, germany, whose, purpose, was, to, bring, the, fullness, of, catholic, faith, to, people, outside, the, church, since, 1868, the, pope, had, been, plagued, first, by, facial, erysipelas, and, then, by, open, sores, on, his, legs, nevertheless, he, insisted, on, celebrating, daily, mass, the, extraordinary, heat, of, the, summer, of, 1877, worsened, the, sores, to, the, effect, that, he, had, to, be, carried, he, underwent, several, painful, medical, procedures, with, remarkable, patience, he, spent, most, of, his, last, few, weeks, in, his, library, where, he, received, cardinals, and, held, papal, audiences, on, 8, december, the, feast, of, the, immaculate, conception, his, situation, improved, markedly, to, the, point, that, he, could, walk, again, by, february, he, could, say, mass, again, on, his, own, in, a, standing, position, enjoying, the, popular, celebration, of, the, 75th, anniversary, of, his, first, communion, bronchitis, a, fall, to, the, floor, and, rising, temperature, worsened, his, situation, after, 4, february, 1878, he, continued, joking, about, himself, when, the, cardinal, vicar, of, rome, ordered, bell, ringing, and, non, stop, prayers, for, his, recuperation, the, pope, asked, why, do, you, want, to, stop, me, from, going, to, heaven, he, told, his, doctor, that, his, time, had, come, pius, ix, lived, just, long, enough, to, witness, the, death, of, his, old, adversary, victor, emmanuel, ii, of, italy, in, january, 1878, as, soon, as, he, learned, about, the, seriousness, of, the, situation, of, the, king, he, absolved, him, of, all, excommunications, and, other, ecclesiastical, punishments, pius, ix, died, one, month, later, on, 7, february, 1878, at, 5, 40, pm, aged, 85, while, saying, the, rosary, with, his, staff, the, cause, of, death, was, epilepsy, which, led, to, a, seizure, and, a, sudden, heart, attack, his, last, words, were, guard, the, church, i, loved, so, well, and, sacredly, as, recorded, by, the, cardinals, kneeling, beside, his, bedside, his, death, concluded, the, second, longest, pontificate, in, papal, history, after, that, of, saint, peter, who, tradition, holds, had, reigned, for, 37, years, his, body, was, originally, buried, in, the, vatican, grottoes, but, was, moved, in, a, night, procession, on, 13, july, 1881, to, the, basilica, of, saint, lawrence, outside, the, walls, when, the, cortege, approached, the, tiber, river, a, group, of, anticlerical, romans, screaming, long, live, italy, death, to, the, pope, death, to, the, priests, threatened, to, throw, the, coffin, into, the, river, but, a, contingent, of, carabinieri, arrived, to, prevent, this, the, simple, grave, of, pius, ix, was, changed, by, his, successor, john, paul, ii, after, his, beatification, the, process, for, his, beatification, which, in, the, early, stages, was, strongly, opposed, by, the, italian, government, was, begun, on, 11, february, 1907, and, recommenced, three, times, the, italian, government, had, since, 1878, strongly, opposed, beatification, of, pius, ix, without, italian, opposition, pope, john, paul, ii, declared, pius, ix, to, be, venerable, on, 6, july, 1985, upon, confirming, his, life, of, heroic, virtue, and, beatified, him, on, 3, september, 2000, his, annual, liturgical, commemoration, is, 7, february, the, date, of, his, death, the, beatification, of, pius, ix, was, controversial, and, was, criticized, by, some, jews, and, christians, because, of, what, was, perceived, as, his, authoritarian, reactionary, politics, the, accusation, of, abuse, of, episcopal, powers, and, antisemitism, most, specifically, the, case, of, edgardo, mortara, but, also, his, reinstituting, the, roman, ghetto, pius, ix, celebrated, his, silver, jubilee, in, 1871, going, on, to, have, the, longest, reign, in, the, history, of, the, post, apostolic, papacy, 31, years, 7, months, and, 23, days, as, his, temporal, sovereignty, was, lost, the, church, rallied, around, him, and, the, papacy, became, more, centralized, encouraged, by, his, personal, habits, of, simplicity, pius, ix, s, pontificate, marks, the, beginning, of, the, modern, papacy, from, his, time, on, it, has, become, increasingly, a, spiritual, rather, than, temporal, authority, having, started, as, a, liberal, pius, ix, turned, conservative, after, being, chased, from, rome, thereafter, he, was, considered, politically, conservative, but, a, restless, and, radical, reformer, and, innovator, of, church, life, and, structures, church, life, religious, vocations, new, foundations, and, religious, enthusiasm, all, flourished, at, the, end, of, his, pontificate, politically, he, suffered, the, isolation, of, the, papacy, from, most, major, world, powers, the, prisoner, of, the, vatican, had, poor, relations, with, russia, germany, the, united, states, and, france, and, open, hostility, with, italy, yet, he, was, most, popular, with, the, remaining, catholic, faithful, in, all, these, countries, in, many, of, which, pope, pius, associations, were, formed, in, his, support, he, made, lasting, ecclesiastical, history, with, his, 1854, infallible, decision, of, the, immaculate, conception, which, was, the, basis, for, the, later, dogma, on, the, assumption, his, other, lasting, contribution, is, the, invocation, of, the, ecumenical, council, vatican, one, which, promulgated, the, definition, of, papal, infallibility, with, his, advice, he, helped, john, bosco, found, the, salesian, society, for, which, reason, he, is, also, called, don, bosco, s, pope, the, pope, s, episcopal, lineage, or, apostolic, succession, was
