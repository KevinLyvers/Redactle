nefertiti, n, f, r, t, i, t, i, c, 1370, c, 1330, bc, was, a, queen, of, the, 18th, dynasty, of, ancient, egypt, the, great, royal, wife, of, pharaoh, akhenaten, nefertiti, and, her, husband, were, known, for, their, radical, overhaul, of, state, religious, policy, in, which, they, promoted, the, earliest, known, form, of, monotheism, atenism, centered, on, the, sun, disc, and, its, direct, connection, to, the, royal, household, with, her, husband, she, reigned, at, what, was, arguably, the, wealthiest, period, of, ancient, egyptian, history, after, her, husband, s, death, some, scholars, believe, that, nefertiti, ruled, briefly, as, the, female, pharaoh, known, by, the, throne, name, neferneferuaten, and, before, the, ascension, of, tutankhamun, although, this, identification, is, a, matter, of, ongoing, debate, if, nefertiti, did, rule, as, pharaoh, her, reign, was, marked, by, the, fall, of, amarna, and, relocation, of, the, capital, back, to, the, traditional, city, of, thebes, in, the, 20th, century, nefertiti, was, made, famous, by, the, discovery, and, display, of, her, ancient, bust, now, in, berlin, s, neues, museum, the, bust, is, one, of, the, most, copied, works, of, the, art, of, ancient, egypt, it, is, attributed, to, the, egyptian, sculptor, thutmose, and, was, excavated, from, his, buried, studio, complex, in, the, early, 20th, century, nefertiti, had, many, titles, including, while, modern, egyptological, pronunciation, renders, her, name, as, n, e, fertiti, her, name, was, the, sentence, nfr, t, jj, tj, or, nfr, t, jy, tj, meaning, the, beautiful, one, has, come, and, probably, contemporarily, pronounced, naftita, from, older, nafrat, ita, or, perhaps, nafert, yiti, almost, nothing, is, known, about, nefertiti, s, life, prior, to, her, marriage, to, akhenaten, scenes, from, the, tombs, of, the, nobles, in, amarna, mention, that, nefertiti, had, a, sister, named, mutbenret, further, a, woman, named, tey, carried, the, title, of, nurse, of, the, great, royal, wife, in, addition, tey, s, husband, ay, carried, the, title, god, s, father, some, egyptologists, believe, that, this, title, was, used, for, a, man, whose, daughter, married, the, pharaoh, based, on, these, titles, it, has, been, proposed, that, ay, was, in, fact, nefertiti, s, father, however, neither, ay, nor, tey, are, explicitly, referred, to, as, nefertiti, s, parents, in, the, existing, sources, at, the, same, time, no, sources, exist, that, directly, contradict, ay, s, fatherhood, which, is, considered, likely, due, to, the, great, influence, he, wielded, during, nefertiti, s, life, and, after, her, death, according, to, another, theory, nefertiti, was, the, daughter, of, ay, and, a, woman, besides, tey, but, ay, s, first, wife, died, before, nefertiti, s, rise, to, the, position, of, queen, whereupon, ay, married, tey, making, her, nefertiti, s, stepmother, nevertheless, this, entire, proposal, is, based, on, speculation, and, conjecture, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, nefertiti, was, akhenaten, s, full, sister, though, this, is, contradicted, by, her, titles, which, do, not, include, the, title, of, king, s, daughter, or, king, s, sister, usually, used, to, indicate, a, relative, of, a, pharaoh, another, theory, about, her, parentage, that, gained, some, support, identified, nefertiti, with, the, mitanni, princess, tadukhipa, partially, based, on, nefertiti, s, name, the, beautiful, woman, has, come, which, has, been, interpreted, by, some, scholars, as, signifying, a, foreign, origin, however, tadukhipa, was, already, married, to, akhenaten, s, father, and, there, is, no, evidence, for, any, reason, why, this, woman, would, need, to, alter, her, name, in, a, proposed, marriage, to, akhenaten, nor, any, hard, evidence, of, a, foreign, non, egyptian, background, for, nefertiti, the, exact, dates, when, nefertiti, married, akhenaten, and, became, the, king, s, great, royal, wife, are, uncertain, they, are, known, to, have, had, at, least, six, daughters, together, including, meritaten, meketaten, ankhesenpaaten, later, called, ankhesenamun, when, she, married, tutankhamun, neferneferuaten, tasherit, neferneferure, and, setepenre, she, was, once, considered, as, a, candidate, for, the, mother, of, tutankhamun, however, a, genetic, study, conducted, on, discovered, mummies, suggests, that, she, was, not, nefertiti, first, appears, in, scenes, in, thebes, in, the, damaged, tomb, tt188, of, the, royal, butler, parennefer, the, new, king, amenhotep, iv, is, accompanied, by, a, royal, woman, and, this, lady, is, thought, to, be, an, early, depiction, of, nefertiti, the, king, and, queen, are, shown, worshiping, the, aten, in, the, tomb, of, the, vizier, ramose, nefertiti, is, shown, standing, behind, amenhotep, iv, in, the, window, of, appearance, during, the, reward, ceremony, for, the, vizier, during, the, early, years, in, thebes, akhenaten, still, known, as, amenhotep, iv, had, several, temples, erected, at, karnak, one, of, the, structures, the, mansion, of, the, benben, hwt, ben, ben, was, dedicated, to, nefertiti, she, is, depicted, with, her, daughter, meritaten, and, in, some, scenes, the, princess, meketaten, participates, as, well, in, scenes, found, on, the, talatat, nefertiti, appears, almost, twice, as, often, as, her, husband, she, is, shown, appearing, behind, her, husband, the, pharaoh, in, offering, scenes, in, the, role, of, the, queen, supporting, her, husband, but, she, is, also, depicted, in, scenes, that, would, have, normally, been, the, prerogative, of, the, king, she, is, shown, smiting, the, enemy, and, captive, enemies, decorate, her, throne, in, the, fourth, year, of, his, reign, amenhotep, iv, decided, to, move, the, capital, to, akhetaten, modern, amarna, in, his, fifth, year, amenhotep, iv, officially, changed, his, name, to, akhenaten, and, nefertiti, was, henceforth, known, as, neferneferuaten, nefertiti, the, name, change, was, a, sign, of, the, ever, increasing, importance, of, the, cult, of, the, aten, it, changed, egypt, s, religion, from, a, polytheistic, religion, to, a, religion, which, may, have, been, better, described, as, a, monolatry, the, depiction, of, a, single, god, as, an, object, for, worship, or, henotheism, one, god, who, is, not, the, only, god, the, boundary, stelae, of, years, 4, and, 5, mark, the, boundaries, of, the, new, city, and, suggest, that, the, move, to, the, new, city, of, akhetaten, occurred, around, that, time, the, new, city, contained, several, large, open, air, temples, dedicated, to, the, aten, nefertiti, and, her, family, would, have, resided, in, the, great, royal, palace, in, the, centre, of, the, city, and, possibly, at, the, northern, palace, as, well, nefertiti, and, the, rest, of, the, royal, family, feature, prominently, in, the, scenes, at, the, palaces, and, in, the, tombs, of, the, nobles, nefertiti, s, steward, during, this, time, was, an, official, named, meryre, ii, he, would, have, been, in, charge, of, running, her, household, inscriptions, in, the, tombs, of, huya, and, meryre, ii, dated, to, year, 12, 2nd, month, of, peret, day, 8, show, a, large, foreign, tribute, the, people, of, kharu, the, north, and, kush, the, south, are, shown, bringing, gifts, of, gold, and, precious, items, to, akhenaten, and, nefertiti, in, the, tomb, of, meryre, ii, nefertiti, s, steward, the, royal, couple, is, shown, seated, in, a, kiosk, with, their, six, daughters, in, attendance, this, is, one, of, the, last, times, princess, meketaten, is, shown, alive, two, representations, of, nefertiti, that, were, excavated, by, flinders, petrie, appear, to, show, nefertiti, in, the, middle, to, later, part, of, akhenaten, s, reign, after, the, exaggerated, style, of, the, early, years, had, relaxed, somewhat, one, is, a, small, piece, on, limestone, and, is, a, preliminary, sketch, of, nefertiti, wearing, her, distinctive, tall, crown, with, carving, began, around, the, mouth, chin, ear, and, tab, of, the, crown, another, is, a, small, inlay, head, petrie, museum, number, uc103, modeled, from, reddish, brown, quartzite, that, was, clearly, intended, to, fit, into, a, larger, composition, meketaten, may, have, died, in, year, 13, or, 14, nefertiti, akhenaten, and, three, princesses, are, shown, mourning, her, the, last, dated, inscription, naming, her, and, akhenaten, comes, from, a, building, inscription, in, the, limestone, quarry, at, dayr, ab, innis, it, dates, to, year, 16, of, the, king, s, reign, and, is, also, the, last, dated, inscription, naming, the, king, many, scholars, believe, nefertiti, had, a, role, elevated, from, that, of, great, royal, wife, and, was, promoted, to, co, regent, by, her, husband, pharaoh, akhenaten, before, his, death, she, is, depicted, in, many, archaeological, sites, as, equal, in, stature, to, a, king, smiting, egypt, s, enemies, riding, a, chariot, and, worshipping, the, aten, in, the, manner, of, a, pharaoh, when, nefertiti, s, name, disappears, from, historical, records, it, is, replaced, by, that, of, a, co, regent, named, neferneferuaten, who, became, a, female, pharaoh, it, seems, likely, that, nefertiti, in, a, similar, fashion, to, the, previous, female, pharaoh, hatshepsut, assumed, the, kingship, under, the, name, pharaoh, neferneferuaten, after, her, husband, s, death, she, was, then, succeeded, by, tutankhamun, it, seems, less, possible, that, nefertiti, disguised, herself, as, a, male, and, assumed, the, male, alter, ego, of, smenkhkare, according, to, van, der, perre, smenkhkare, is, thought, to, be, a, co, regent, of, akhenaten, who, died, before, neferneferuaten, assumed, the, kingship, if, nefertiti, did, rule, egypt, as, a, pharaoh, it, has, been, theorized, that, she, would, have, attempted, damage, control, and, may, have, re, instated, the, ancient, egyptian, religion, and, the, amun, priests, she, would, have, raised, tutankhamun, in, the, worship, of, the, traditional, gods, archaeologist, and, egyptologist, dr, zahi, hawass, theorized, that, nefertiti, returned, to, thebes, from, amarna, to, rule, as, a, pharaoh, based, on, ushabti, and, other, feminine, evidence, of, a, female, pharaoh, found, in, tutankhamun, s, tomb, as, well, as, evidence, of, nefertiti, smiting, egypt, s, enemies, which, was, a, duty, reserved, to, kings, pre, 2012, egyptological, theories, thought, that, nefertiti, vanished, from, the, historical, record, around, year, 12, of, akhenaten, s, reign, with, no, word, of, her, thereafter, conjectured, causes, included, injury, a, plague, that, was, sweeping, through, the, city, and, a, natural, cause, this, theory, was, based, on, the, discovery, of, several, ushabti, fragments, inscribed, for, nefertiti, now, located, in, the, louvre, and, the, brooklyn, museum, a, previous, theory, that, she, fell, into, disgrace, was, discredited, when, deliberate, erasures, of, monuments, belonging, to, a, queen, of, akhenaten, were, shown, to, refer, to, kiya, instead, during, akhenaten, s, reign, and, perhaps, after, nefertiti, enjoyed, unprecedented, power, by, the, twelfth, year, of, his, reign, there, is, evidence, she, may, have, been, elevated, to, the, status, of, co, regent, equal, in, status, to, the, pharaoh, as, may, be, depicted, on, the, coregency, stela, it, is, possible, that, nefertiti, is, the, ruler, named, neferneferuaten, some, theorists, believe, that, nefertiti, was, still, alive, and, held, influence, on, the, younger, royals, if, this, is, the, case, that, influence, and, presumably, nefertiti, s, own, life, would, have, ended, by, year, 3, of, tutankhaten, s, reign, 1331, bc, in, that, year, tutankhaten, changed, his, name, to, tutankhamun, this, is, evidence, of, his, return, to, the, official, worship, of, amun, and, abandonment, of, amarna, to, return, the, capital, to, thebes, in, 2012, the, discovery, of, an, inscription, dated, to, year, 16, month, 3, of, akhet, day, 15, of, the, reign, of, akhenaten, was, announced, 196, 197, it, was, discovered, within, quarry, 320, in, the, largest, wadi, of, the, limestone, quarry, at, dayr, ab, innis, the, five, line, inscription, written, in, red, ochre, mentions, the, presence, of, the, great, royal, wife, his, beloved, mistress, of, the, two, lands, neferneferuaten, nefertiti, 197, the, final, line, of, the, inscription, refers, to, ongoing, building, work, being, carried, out, under, the, authority, of, the, king, s, scribe, penthu, on, the, small, aten, temple, in, amarna, van, der, perre, stresses, that, this, inscription, offers, incontrovertible, evidence, that, both, akhenaten, and, nefertiti, were, still, alive, in, the, 16th, year, of, his, reign, and, more, importantly, that, they, were, still, holding, the, same, positions, as, at, the, start, of, their, reign, this, makes, it, necessary, to, rethink, the, final, years, of, the, amarna, period, this, means, that, nefertiti, was, alive, in, the, second, to, last, year, of, akhenaten, s, reign, and, demonstrates, that, akhenaten, still, ruled, alone, with, his, wife, by, his, side, therefore, the, rule, of, the, female, amarna, pharaoh, known, as, neferneferuaten, must, be, placed, between, the, death, of, akhenaten, and, the, accession, of, tutankhamun, neferneferuaten, this, female, pharaoh, specifically, used, the, epithet, effective, for, her, husband, in, one, of, her, cartouches, which, means, she, was, either, nefertiti, or, her, daughter, meritaten, who, was, married, to, king, smenkhkare, nefertiti, s, burial, was, intended, to, be, made, within, the, royal, tomb, as, laid, out, in, the, boundary, stelae, it, is, possible, that, the, unfinished, annex, of, the, royal, tomb, was, intended, for, her, use, however, given, that, akhenaten, appears, to, have, predeceased, her, it, is, highly, unlikely, she, was, ever, buried, there, one, shabti, is, known, to, have, been, made, for, her, the, unfinished, tomb, 29, which, would, have, been, of, very, similar, dimensions, to, the, royal, tomb, had, it, been, finished, is, the, most, likely, candidate, for, a, tomb, begun, for, nefertiti, s, exclusive, use, given, that, it, lacks, a, burial, chamber, she, was, not, interred, there, either, in, 2015, english, archaeologist, nicholas, reeves, announced, that, high, resolution, scans, revealed, voids, behind, the, walls, of, tutankhamun, s, tomb, which, he, proposed, to, be, the, burial, chamber, of, nefertiti, but, subsequent, radar, scans, showed, that, there, are, no, hidden, chambers, in, 1898, french, archeologist, victor, loret, found, two, female, mummies, among, those, cached, inside, the, tomb, of, amenhotep, ii, in, kv35, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, these, two, mummies, known, as, the, elder, lady, and, the, younger, lady, were, identified, as, likely, candidates, of, her, remains, an, article, in, kmt, magazine, in, 2001, suggested, that, the, elder, lady, might, be, nefertiti, however, it, was, subsequently, shown, that, the, elder, lady, is, in, fact, tiye, mother, of, akhenaten, a, lock, of, hair, found, in, a, coffinette, bearing, an, inscription, naming, queen, tiye, proved, a, near, perfect, match, to, the, hair, of, the, elder, lady, dna, analysis, confirmed, that, she, was, the, daughter, of, tiye, s, parents, yuya, and, thuya, on, 9, june, 2003, archaeologist, joann, fletcher, a, specialist, in, ancient, hair, from, the, university, of, york, in, england, announced, that, nefertiti, s, mummy, may, have, been, the, younger, lady, this, theory, was, criticised, by, zahi, hawass, and, several, other, egyptologists, in, a, subsequent, research, project, led, by, hawass, the, mummy, was, put, through, ct, scan, analysis, and, dna, analysis, researchers, concluded, that, she, is, tutankhamun, s, biological, mother, an, unnamed, daughter, of, amenhotep, iii, and, tiye, not, nefertiti, one, of, the, two, female, mummies, found, in, kv21, has, been, suggested, as, the, body, of, nefertiti, dna, analysis, did, not, yield, enough, data, to, make, a, definitive, identification, but, confirmed, she, was, a, member, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, royal, line, ct, scanning, revealed, she, was, about, 45, at, the, time, of, her, death, her, left, arm, had, been, bent, over, her, chest, in, the, queenly, pose, the, possible, identification, is, based, on, her, association, with, the, mummy, tentatively, identified, as, ankhesenamun, it, is, suggested, that, just, as, a, mother, and, daughter, tiye, and, the, younger, lady, were, found, lying, together, in, kv35, the, same, was, true, of, these, mummies, a, document, was, found, in, the, ancient, hittite, capital, of, hattusa, which, dates, to, the, amarna, period, the, document, is, part, of, the, so, called, deeds, of, suppiluliuma, i, while, laying, siege, to, karkemish, the, hittite, ruler, receives, a, letter, from, the, egyptian, queen, the, letter, reads, my, husband, has, died, and, i, have, no, son, they, say, about, you, that, you, have, many, sons, you, might, give, me, one, of, your, sons, to, become, my, husband, i, would, not, wish, to, take, one, of, my, subjects, as, a, husband, i, am, afraid, this, proposal, is, considered, extraordinary, as, new, kingdom, royal, women, never, married, foreign, royalty, suppiluliuma, i, was, understandably, surprised, and, exclaimed, to, his, courtiers, nothing, like, this, has, happened, to, me, in, my, entire, life, understandably, he, was, wary, and, had, an, envoy, investigate, the, situation, but, by, so, doing, he, missed, his, chance, to, bring, egypt, into, his, empire, he, eventually, did, send, one, of, his, sons, zannanza, but, the, prince, died, perhaps, murdered, en, route, the, identity, of, the, queen, who, wrote, the, letter, is, uncertain, she, is, called, dakhamunzu, in, the, hittite, annals, a, translation, of, the, egyptian, title, ta, hemet, nesu, the, king, s, wife, the, possible, candidates, are, nefertiti, meritaten, and, ankhesenamun, ankhesenamun, once, seemed, the, likeliest, since, there, were, no, candidates, for, the, throne, on, the, death, of, her, husband, tutankhamun, whereas, akhenaten, had, at, least, two, legitimate, successors, but, this, was, based, on, the, assumption, of, a, 27, year, reign, for, the, last, 18th, dynasty, pharaoh, horemheb, who, is, now, accepted, to, have, had, a, shorter, reign, of, only, 14, years, this, makes, the, deceased, egyptian, king, appear, to, be, akhenaten, instead, rather, than, tutankhamun, furthermore, the, phrase, regarding, marriage, to, one, of, my, subjects, translated, by, some, as, servants, is, possibly, either, a, reference, to, the, grand, vizier, ay, or, a, secondary, member, of, the, egyptian, royal, family, line, since, nefertiti, was, depicted, as, being, as, powerful, as, her, husband, in, official, monuments, smiting, egypt, s, enemies, she, might, be, the, dakhamunzu, in, the, amarna, correspondence, as, nicholas, reeves, believes
