sources, not, only, other, marxists, but, also, thinkers, such, as, niccol, machiavelli, vilfredo, pareto, georges, sorel, and, benedetto, croce, the, notebooks, cover, a, wide, range, of, topics, including, the, history, of, italy, and, italian, nationalism, the, french, revolution, fascism, taylorism, and, fordism, civil, society, the, state, historical, materialism, folklore, religion, and, high, and, popular, culture, gramsci, is, best, known, for, his, theory, of, cultural, hegemony, which, describes, how, the, state, and, ruling, capitalist, class, the, bourgeoisie, use, cultural, institutions, to, maintain, wealth, and, power, in, capitalist, societies, in, gramsci, s, view, the, bourgeoisie, develops, a, hegemonic, culture, using, ideology, rather, than, violence, economic, force, or, coercion, he, also, attempted, to, break, from, the, economic, determinism, of, orthodox, marxist, thought, and, so, is, sometimes, described, as, a, neo, marxist, he, held, a, humanistic, understanding, of, marxism, seeing, it, as, a, philosophy, of, praxis, and, an, absolute, historicism, that, transcends, traditional, materialism, and, traditional, idealism, gramsci, was, born, in, ales, in, the, province, of, oristano, on, the, island, of, sardinia, the, fourth, of, seven, sons, of, francesco, gramsci, 1860, 1937, and, giuseppina, marcias, 1861, 1932, francesco, gramsci, was, born, in, the, small, town, of, gaeta, in, the, province, of, latina, lazio, today, in, the, central, italian, region, of, lazio, but, at, the, time, gaeta, was, still, part, of, terra, di, lavoro, of, southern, italy, to, a, well, off, family, from, the, southern, italian, regions, of, campania, and, calabria, and, of, arb, resh, italo, albanian, descent, gramsci, himself, believed, that, his, father, s, family, had, left, albania, as, recently, as, 1821, the, albanian, origin, of, his, father, s, family, is, attested, in, the, surname, gramsci, an, italianised, form, of, gramshi, which, stems, from, the, definite, noun, of, the, placename, gramsh, a, small, town, in, central, eastern, albania, gramsci, s, mother, belonged, to, a, sardinian, landowning, family, from, sorgono, in, the, province, of, nuoro, francesco, gramsci, worked, as, a, low, level, official, and, his, financial, difficulties, and, troubles, with, the, police, forced, the, family, to, move, about, through, several, villages, in, sardinia, until, they, finally, settled, in, ghilarza, in, 1898, gramsci, s, father, was, convicted, of, embezzlement, and, imprisoned, reducing, his, family, to, destitution, the, young, gramsci, had, to, abandon, schooling, and, work, at, various, casual, jobs, until, his, father, s, release, in, 1904, as, a, boy, gramsci, suffered, from, health, problems, particularly, a, malformation, of, the, spine, that, stunted, his, growth, as, his, adult, height, was, less, than, 5, feet, and, left, him, seriously, hunchbacked, for, decades, it, was, reported, that, his, condition, had, been, due, to, a, childhood, accident, specifically, having, been, dropped, by, a, nanny, but, more, recently, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, was, due, to, pott, disease, a, form, of, tuberculosis, that, can, cause, deformity, of, the, spine, gramsci, was, also, plagued, by, various, internal, disorders, throughout, his, life, gramsci, started, secondary, school, in, santu, lussurgiu, and, completed, it, in, cagliari, where, he, lodged, with, his, elder, brother, gennaro, a, former, soldier, whose, time, on, the, mainland, had, made, him, a, militant, socialist, at, the, time, gramsci, s, sympathies, then, did, not, yet, lie, with, socialism, but, rather, with, sardinian, autonomism, as, well, as, the, grievances, of, impoverished, sardinian, peasants, and, miners, whose, mistreatment, by, the, mainlanders, would, later, deeply, contribute, to, his, intellectual, growth, they, perceived, their, neglect, as, a, result, of, privileges, enjoyed, by, the, rapidly, industrialising, northern, italy, and, they, tended, to, turn, to, a, growing, sardinian, nationalism, brutally, repressed, by, troops, from, the, italian, mainland, as, a, response, in, 1911, gramsci, won, a, scholarship, to, study, at, the, university, of, turin, sitting, the, exam, at, the, same, time, as, palmiro, togliatti, at, turin, he, read, literature, and, took, a, keen, interest, in, linguistics, which, he, studied, under, matteo, bartoli, gramsci, was, in, turin, while, it, was, going, through, industrialization, with, the, fiat, and, lancia, factories, recruiting, workers, from, poorer, regions, trade, unions, became, established, and, the, first, industrial, social, conflicts, started, to, emerge, gramsci, frequented, socialist, circles, as, well, as, associating, with, sardinian, emigrants, on, the, italian, mainland, both, his, earlier, experiences, in, sardinia, and, his, environment, on, the, mainland, shaped, his, worldview, gramsci, joined, the, italian, socialist, party, psi, in, late, 1913, where, he, would, later, occupy, a, key, position, and, observe, from, turin, the, russian, revolution, although, showing, a, talent, for, his, studies, gramsci, had, financial, problems, and, poor, health, together, with, his, growing, political, commitment, these, led, to, him, abandoning, his, education, in, early, 1915, at, age, 24, by, this, time, he, had, acquired, an, extensive, knowledge, of, history, and, philosophy, at, university, he, had, come, into, contact, with, the, thought, of, antonio, labriola, rodolfo, mondolfo, giovanni, gentile, and, most, importantly, benedetto, croce, possibly, the, most, widely, respected, italian, intellectual, of, his, day, labriola, especially, propounded, a, brand, of, hegelian, marxism, that, he, labelled, philosophy, of, praxis, although, gramsci, later, used, this, phrase, to, escape, the, prison, censors, his, relationship, with, this, current, of, thought, was, ambiguous, throughout, his, life, from, 1914, onward, gramsci, s, writings, for, socialist, newspapers, such, as, il, grido, del, popolo, the, cry, of, the, people, earned, him, a, reputation, as, a, notable, journalist, in, 1916, he, became, co, editor, of, the, piedmont, edition, of, avanti, the, socialist, party, official, organ, an, articulate, and, prolific, writer, of, political, theory, gramsci, proved, a, formidable, commentator, writing, on, all, aspects, of, turin, s, social, and, political, events, gramsci, was, at, this, time, also, involved, in, the, education, and, organisation, of, turin, workers, he, spoke, in, public, for, the, first, time, in, 1916, and, gave, talks, on, topics, such, as, romain, rolland, the, french, revolution, the, paris, commune, and, the, emancipation, of, women, in, the, wake, of, the, arrest, of, socialist, party, leaders, that, followed, revolutionary, riots, in, august, 1917, gramsci, became, one, of, turin, s, leading, socialists, he, was, elected, to, the, party, s, provisional, committee, and, also, made, editor, of, il, grido, del, popolo, in, april, 1919, with, togliatti, angelo, tasca, and, umberto, terracini, gramsci, set, up, the, weekly, newspaper, l, ordine, nuovo, the, new, order, in, october, the, same, year, despite, being, divided, into, various, hostile, factions, the, psi, moved, by, a, large, majority, to, join, the, third, international, vladimir, lenin, saw, the, l, ordine, nuovo, group, as, closest, in, orientation, to, the, bolsheviks, and, it, received, his, backing, against, the, anti, parliamentary, programme, of, a, left, communist, amadeo, bordiga, in, the, course, of, tactical, debates, within, the, party, gramsci, s, group, mainly, stood, out, due, to, its, advocacy, of, workers, councils, which, had, come, into, existence, in, turin, spontaneously, during, the, large, strikes, of, 1919, and, 1920, for, gramsci, these, councils, were, the, proper, means, of, enabling, workers, to, take, control, of, the, task, of, organising, production, and, saw, them, as, preparing, the, whole, class, for, the, aims, of, conquest, and, government, although, he, believed, his, position, at, this, time, to, be, in, keeping, with, lenin, s, policy, of, all, power, to, the, soviets, his, stance, that, these, italian, councils, were, communist, rather, than, just, one, organ, of, political, struggle, against, the, bourgeoisie, was, attacked, by, bordiga, for, betraying, a, syndicalist, tendency, influenced, by, the, thought, of, georges, sorel, and, daniel, de, leon, by, the, time, of, the, defeat, of, the, turin, workers, in, spring, 1920, gramsci, was, almost, alone, in, his, defence, of, the, councils, the, failure, of, the, workers, councils, to, develop, into, a, national, movement, convinced, gramsci, that, a, communist, party, in, the, leninist, sense, was, needed, the, group, around, l, ordine, nuovo, declaimed, incessantly, against, the, psi, s, centrist, leadership, and, ultimately, allied, with, bordiga, s, far, larger, abstentionist, faction, on, 21, january, 1921, in, the, town, of, livorno, leghorn, the, communist, party, of, italy, partito, comunista, d, italia, pcd, i, was, founded, in, opposition, to, bordiga, gramsci, supported, the, arditi, del, popolo, a, militant, anti, fascist, group, which, struggled, against, the, blackshirts, gramsci, would, be, a, leader, of, the, party, from, its, inception, but, was, subordinate, to, bordiga, whose, emphasis, on, discipline, centralism, and, purity, of, principles, dominated, the, party, s, programme, until, the, latter, lost, the, leadership, in, 1924, in, 1922, gramsci, travelled, to, russia, as, a, representative, of, the, new, party, here, he, met, julia, schucht, yulia, apollonovna, schucht, 1896, 1980, a, young, violinist, whom, he, married, in, 1923, and, with, whom, he, had, two, sons, delio, 1924, 1982, and, giuliano, 1926, 2007, gramsci, never, saw, his, second, son, the, russian, mission, coincided, with, the, advent, of, fascism, in, italy, and, gramsci, returned, with, instructions, to, foster, against, the, wishes, of, the, pcd, i, leadership, a, united, front, of, leftist, parties, against, fascism, such, a, front, would, ideally, have, had, the, pcd, i, at, its, centre, through, which, moscow, would, have, controlled, all, the, leftist, forces, but, others, disputed, this, potential, supremacy, as, socialists, had, a, significant, while, communists, seemed, relatively, young, and, too, radical, many, believed, that, an, eventual, coalition, led, by, communists, would, have, functioned, too, remotely, from, political, debate, and, thus, would, have, run, the, risk, of, isolation, in, late, 1922, and, early, 1923, benito, mussolini, s, government, embarked, on, a, campaign, of, repression, against, the, opposition, parties, arresting, most, of, the, pcd, i, leadership, including, bordiga, at, the, end, of, 1923, gramsci, travelled, from, moscow, to, vienna, where, he, tried, to, revive, a, party, torn, by, factional, strife, in, 1924, gramsci, now, recognised, as, head, of, the, pcd, i, gained, election, as, a, deputy, for, the, veneto, he, started, organizing, the, launch, of, the, official, newspaper, of, the, party, called, l, unit, unity, living, in, rome, while, his, family, stayed, in, moscow, at, its, lyon, congress, in, january, 1926, gramsci, s, theses, calling, for, a, united, front, to, restore, democracy, to, italy, were, adopted, by, the, party, in, 1926, joseph, stalin, s, manoeuvres, inside, the, bolshevik, party, moved, gramsci, to, write, a, letter, to, the, comintern, in, which, he, deplored, the, opposition, led, by, leon, trotsky, but, also, underlined, some, presumed, faults, of, the, leader, togliatti, in, moscow, as, a, representative, of, the, party, received, the, letter, opened, it, read, it, and, decided, not, to, deliver, it, this, caused, a, difficult, conflict, between, gramsci, and, togliatti, which, they, never, completely, resolved, on, 9, november, 1926, the, fascist, government, enacted, a, new, wave, of, emergency, laws, taking, as, a, pretext, an, alleged, attempt, on, mussolini, s, life, that, had, occurred, several, days, earlier, the, fascist, police, arrested, gramsci, despite, his, parliamentary, immunity, and, brought, him, to, the, roman, prison, regina, coeli, at, his, trial, gramsci, s, prosecutor, stated, for, twenty, years, we, must, stop, this, brain, from, functioning, he, received, an, immediate, sentence, of, five, years, in, confinement, on, the, island, of, ustica, and, the, following, year, he, received, a, sentence, of, 20, years, imprisonment, in, turi, apulia, near, bari, over, 11, years, in, prison, his, health, deteriorated, over, this, period, his, teeth, fell, out, his, digestive, system, collapsed, so, that, he, could, not, eat, solid, food, he, had, convulsions, when, he, vomited, blood, and, suffered, headaches, so, violent, that, he, beat, his, head, against, the, walls, of, his, cell, an, international, campaign, organised, by, piero, sraffa, at, cambridge, university, and, gramsci, s, sister, in, law, tatiana, was, mounted, to, demand, gramsci, s, release, in, 1933, he, was, moved, from, the, prison, at, turi, to, a, clinic, at, formia, he, was, still, being, denied, adequate, medical, attention, two, years, later, he, was, moved, to, the, quisisana, clinic, in, rome, he, was, due, for, release, on, 21, april, 1937, and, planned, to, retire, to, sardinia, for, convalescence, but, a, combination, of, arteriosclerosis, pulmonary, tuberculosis, high, blood, pressure, angina, gout, and, acute, gastric, disorders, meant, that, he, was, too, ill, to, move, gramsci, died, on, 27, april, 1937, at, the, age, of, 46, his, ashes, are, buried, in, the, cimitero, acattolico, in, rome, by, moving, gramsci, from, prison, to, hospital, when, he, became, very, ill, the, mussolini, regime, was, attempting, to, avoid, the, accusation, that, it, was, his, incarceration, that, caused, his, death, nevertheless, his, death, was, linked, directly, to, prison, conditions, gramsci, s, grandson, antonio, jr, speculated, that, gramsci, had, been, working, with, the, soviet, government, to, facilitate, a, move, to, moscow, but, changed, course, as, the, political, climate, in, russia, intensified, in, 1936, gramsci, was, one, of, the, most, influential, marxist, thinkers, of, the, 20th, century, and, a, particularly, key, thinker, in, the, development, of, western, marxism, he, wrote, more, than, 30, notebooks, and, 3, 000, pages, of, history, and, analysis, during, his, imprisonment, these, writings, known, as, the, prison, notebooks, contain, gramsci, s, tracing, of, italian, history, and, nationalism, as, well, as, some, ideas, in, marxist, theory, critical, theory, and, educational, theory, associated, with, his, name, such, as, hegemony, was, a, term, previously, used, by, marxists, such, as, vladimir, lenin, to, denote, the, political, leadership, of, the, working, class, in, a, democratic, revolution, 15, 17, gramsci, greatly, expanded, this, concept, developing, an, acute, analysis, of, how, the, ruling, capitalist, class, the, bourgeoisie, establishes, and, maintains, its, control, 20, classical, marxism, had, predicted, that, socialist, revolution, was, inevitable, in, capitalist, societies, by, the, early, 20th, century, no, such, revolution, had, occurred, in, the, most, advanced, nations, and, those, revolutions, of, 1917, 1923, such, as, in, germany, or, the, biennio, rosso, in, italy, had, failed, as, capitalism, seemed, more, entrenched, than, ever, gramsci, suggested, that, it, maintained, control, not, just, through, violence, and, political, and, economic, coercion, but, also, through, ideology, the, bourgeoisie, developed, a, hegemonic, culture, which, propagated, its, own, values, and, norms, so, that, they, became, the, common, sense, values, of, all, people, in, the, working, class, and, other, classes, identified, their, own, good, with, the, good, of, the, bourgeoisie, and, helped, to, maintain, the, status, quo, rather, than, revolting, to, counter, the, notion, that, bourgeois, values, represented, natural, or, normal, values, for, society, the, working, class, needed, to, develop, a, culture, of, its, own, while, lenin, held, that, culture, was, ancillary, to, political, objectives, gramsci, saw, it, as, fundamental, to, the, attainment, of, power, that, cultural, hegemony, be, achieved, first, in, gramsci, s, view, a, class, cannot, dominate, in, modern, conditions, by, merely, advancing, its, own, narrow, economic, interests, and, neither, can, it, dominate, purely, through, force, and, coercion, rather, it, must, exert, intellectual, and, moral, leadership, and, make, alliances, and, compromises, with, a, variety, of, forces, gramsci, calls, this, union, of, social, forces, a, historic, bloc, taking, a, term, from, georges, sorel, this, bloc, forms, the, basis, of, consent, to, a, certain, social, order, which, produces, and, re, produces, the, hegemony, of, the, dominant, class, through, a, nexus, of, institutions, social, relations, and, ideas, in, this, way, gramsci, s, theory, emphasized, the, importance, of, the, political, and, ideological, superstructure, in, both, maintaining, and, fracturing, relations, of, the, economic, base, gramsci, stated, that, bourgeois, cultural, values, were, tied, to, folklore, popular, culture, and, religion, and, therefore, much, of, his, analysis, of, hegemonic, culture, is, aimed, at, these, he, was, also, impressed, by, the, influence, that, the, catholic, church, had, and, the, care, it, had, taken, to, prevent, an, excessive, gap, from, developing, between, the, religion, of, the, learned, and, that, of, the, less, educated, gramsci, saw, marxism, as, a, marriage, of, the, purely, intellectual, critique, of, religion, found, in, renaissance, humanism, and, the, elements, of, the, reformation, that, had, appealed, to, the, masses, for, gramsci, marxism, could, supersede, religion, only, if, it, met, people, s, spiritual, needs, and, to, do, so, people, would, have, to, think, of, it, as, an, expression, of, their, own, experience, gramsci, gave, much, thought, to, the, role, of, intellectuals, in, society, he, stated, that, all, men, are, intellectuals, in, that, all, have, intellectual, and, rational, faculties, but, not, all, men, have, the, social, function, of, intellectuals, he, saw, modern, intellectuals, not, as, talkers, but, as, practical, minded, directors, and, organisers, who, produced, hegemony, through, ideological, apparatuses, such, as, education, and, the, media, furthermore, he, distinguished, between, a, traditional, intelligentsia, which, sees, itself, in, his, view, wrongly, as, a, class, apart, from, society, and, the, thinking, groups, that, every, class, produces, from, its, own, ranks, organically, such, organic, intellectuals, do, not, simply, describe, social, life, in, accordance, with, scientific, rules, but, instead, articulate, through, the, language, of, culture, the, feelings, and, experiences, which, the, masses, could, not, express, for, themselves, to, gramsci, it, was, the, duty, of, organic, intellectuals, to, speak, to, the, obscured, precepts, of, folk, wisdom, or, common, sense, senso, comune, of, their, respective, political, spheres, these, intellectuals, would, represent, excluded, social, groups, of, a, society, or, what, gramsci, referred, to, as, the, subaltern, in, line, with, gramsci, s, theories, of, cultural, hegemony, he, argued, that, capitalist, power, needed, to, be, challenged, by, building, a, counter, hegemony, by, this, he, meant, that, as, part, of, the, war, of, position, the, organic, intellectuals, and, others, within, the, working, class, need, to, develop, alternative, values, and, an, alternative, ideology, in, contrast, to, bourgeois, ideology, he, argued, that, the, reason, this, had, not, needed, to, happen, in, russia, was, because, the, russian, ruling, class, did, not, have, genuine, cultural, hegemony, so, the, bolsheviks, were, able, to, carry, out, a, war, of, manoeuvre, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, relatively, easily, because, ruling, class, hegemony, had, never, been, fully, achieved, he, believed, that, a, final, war, of, manoeuvre, was, only, possible, in, the, developed, and, advanced, capitalist, societies, when, the, war, of, position, had, been, won, by, the, organic, intellectuals, and, the, working, class, building, a, counter, hegemony, the, need, to, create, a, working, class, culture, and, a, counter, hegemony, relates, to, gramsci, s, call, for, a, kind, of, education, that, could, develop, working, class, intellectuals, whose, task, was, not, to, introduce, marxist, ideology, into, the, consciousness, of, the, proletariat, as, a, set, of, foreign, notions, but, to, renovate, the, existing, intellectual, activity, of, the, masses, and, make, it, natively, critical, of, the, status, quo, his, ideas, about, an, education, system, for, this, purpose, correspond, with, the, notion, of, critical, pedagogy, and, popular, education, as, theorized, and, practised, in, later, decades, by, paulo, freire, in, brazil, and, have, much, in, common, with, the, thought, of, frantz, fanon, for, this, reason, partisans, of, adult, and, popular, education, consider, gramsci, s, writings, and, ideas, important, to, this, day, gramsci, s, theory, of, hegemony, is, tied, to, his, conception, of, the, capitalist, state, gramsci, does, not, understand, the, state, in, the, narrow, sense, of, the, government, instead, he, divides, it, between, political, society, the, police, the, army, legal, system, etc, the, arena, of, political, institutions, and, legal, constitutional, control, and, civil, society, the, family, the, education, system, trade, unions, etc, commonly, seen, as, the, private, or, non, state, sphere, which, mediates, between, the, state, and, the, economy, he, stresses, that, the, division, is, purely, conceptual, and, that, the, two, often, overlap, in, reality, gramsci, posits, that, the, capitalist, state, rules, through, force, plus, consent, political, society, is, the, realm, of, force, and, civil, society, is, the, realm, of, consent, he, argues, that, under, modern, capitalism, the, bourgeoisie, can, maintain, its, economic, control, by, allowing, certain, demands, made, by, trade, unions, and, mass, political, parties, within, civil, society, to, be, met, by, the, political, sphere, thus, the, bourgeoisie, engages, in, passive, revolution, by, going, beyond, its, immediate, economic, interests, and, allowing, the, forms, of, its, hegemony, to, change, gramsci, posits, that, movements, such, as, reformism, and, fascism, as, well, as, the, scientific, management, and, assembly, line, methods, of, frederick, winslow, taylor, and, henry, ford, respectively, are, examples, of, this, drawing, from, niccol, machiavelli, gramsci, argues, that, the, modern, prince, the, revolutionary, party, is, the, force, that, will, allow, the, working, class, to, develop, organic, intellectuals, and, an, alternative, hegemony, within, civil, society, for, gramsci, the, complex, nature, of, modern, civil, society, means, that, a, war, of, position, carried, out, by, revolutionaries, through, political, agitation, the, trade, unions, advancement, of, proletarian, culture, and, other, ways, to, create, an, opposing, civil, society, was, necessary, alongside, a, war, of, manoeuvre, a, direct, revolution, in, order, to, have, a, successful, revolution, without, danger, of, a, counter, revolution, or, degeneration, despite, his, claim, that, the, lines, between, the, two, may, be, blurred, gramsci, rejects, the, state, worship, that, results, from, equating, political, society, with, civil, society, as, was, done, by, the, jacobins, and, fascists, he, believes, the, proletariat, s, historical, task, is, to, create, a, regulated, society, where, political, society, is, diminished, and, civil, society, is, expanded, he, defines, the, withering, away, of, the, state, as, the, full, development, of, civil, society, s, ability, to, regulate, itself, like, the, young, marx, gramsci, was, an, emphatic, proponent, of, historicism, in, gramsci, s, view, all, meaning, derives, from, the, relation, between, human, practical, activity, or, praxis, and, the, objective, historical, and, social, processes, of, which, it, is, a, part, ideas, cannot, be, understood, outside, their, social, and, historical, context, apart, from, their, function, and, origin, the, concepts, by, which, we, organise, our, knowledge, of, the, world, do, not, derive, primarily, from, our, relation, to, objects, but, rather, from, the, social, relations, between, the, users, of, those, concepts, as, a, result, there, is, no, such, thing, as, an, unchanging, human, nature, but, only, historically, variable, social, relationships, furthermore, philosophy, and, science, do, not, reflect, a, reality, independent, of, man, rather, a, theory, can, be, said, to, be, true, when, in, any, given, historical, situation, it, expresses, the, real, developmental, trend, of, that, situation, for, the, majority, of, marxists, truth, was, truth, no, matter, when, and, where, it, was, known, and, scientific, knowledge, which, included, marxism, accumulated, historically, as, the, advance, of, truth, in, this, everyday, sense, in, this, view, marxism, or, the, marxist, theory, of, history, and, economics, did, not, belong, to, the, illusory, realm, of, the, superstructure, because, it, is, a, science, in, contrast, gramsci, believed, marxism, was, true, in, a, socially, pragmatic, sense, by, articulating, the, class, consciousness, of, the, proletariat, marxism, expressed, the, truth, of, its, times, better, than, any, other, theory, this, anti, scientistic, and, anti, positivist, stance, was, indebted, to, the, influence, of, benedetto, croce, at, the, same, time, it, should, be, underlined, that, gramsci, s, absolute, historicism, broke, with, croce, s, tendency, to, secure, a, metaphysical, synthesis, of, historical, destiny, although, gramsci, repudiates, the, charge, his, historical, account, of, truth, has, been, criticised, as, a, form, of, relativism, in, a, pre, prison, article, titled, the, revolution, against, das, kapital, gramsci, wrote, that, the, october, revolution, in, russia, had, invalidated, the, idea, that, socialist, revolution, had, to, await, the, full, development, of, capitalist, forces, of, production, this, reflected, his, view, that, marxism, was, not, a, determinist, philosophy, the, principle, of, the, causal, primacy, of, the, forces, of, production, was, a, misconception, of, marxism, both, economic, changes, and, cultural, changes, are, expressions, of, a, basic, historical, process, and, it, is, difficult, to, say, which, sphere, has, primacy, over, the, other, the, belief, from, the, earliest, years, of, the, workers, movement, that, it, would, inevitably, triumph, due, to, historical, laws, was, a, product, of, the, historical, circumstances, of, an, oppressed, class, restricted, mainly, to, defensive, action, this, fatalistic, doctrine, must, be, abandoned, as, a, hindrance, once, the, working, class, becomes, able, to, take, the, initiative, because, marxism, is, a, philosophy, of, praxis, it, cannot, rely, on, unseen, historical, laws, as, the, agents, of, social, change, history, is, defined, by, human, praxis, and, therefore, includes, human, will, nonetheless, willpower, cannot, achieve, anything, it, likes, in, any, given, situation, when, the, consciousness, of, the, working, class, reaches, the, stage, of, development, necessary, for, action, it, will, encounter, historical, circumstances, that, cannot, be, arbitrarily, altered, it, is, not, predetermined, by, historical, inevitability, as, to, which, of, several, possible, developments, will, take, place, as, a, result, his, critique, of, economic, determinism, extended, to, that, practised, by, the, syndicalists, of, the, italian, trade, unions, he, believed, that, many, trade, unionists, had, settled, for, a, reformist, gradualist, approach, in, that, they, had, refused, to, struggle, on, the, political, front, in, addition, to, the, economic, front, for, gramsci, much, as, the, ruling, class, can, look, beyond, its, own, immediate, economic, interests, to, reorganise, the, forms, of, its, own, hegemony, so, must, the, working, class, present, its, own, interests, as, congruous, with, the, universal, advancement, of, society, while, gramsci, envisioned, the, trade, unions, as, one, organ, of, a, counter, hegemonic, force, in, a, capitalist, society, the, trade, union, leaders, simply, saw, these, organizations, as, a, means, to, improve, conditions, within, the, existing, structure, gramsci, referred, to, the, views, of, these, trade, unionists, as, vulgar, economism, which, he, equated, to, covert, reformism, and, liberalism, by, virtue, of, his, belief, that, human, history, and, collective, praxis, determine, whether, any, philosophical, question, is, meaningful, or, not, gramsci, s, views, run, contrary, to, the, metaphysical, materialism, and, copy, theory, of, perception, advanced, by, friedrich, engels, and, lenin, although, he, does, not, explicitly, state, this, for, gramsci, marxism, does, not, deal, with, a, reality, that, exists, in, and, for, itself, independent, of, humanity, the, concept, of, an, objective, universe, outside, of, human, history, and, human, praxis, was, analogous, to, belief, in, god, gramsci, defined, objectivity, in, terms, of, a, universal, intersubjectivity, to, be, established, in, a, future, communist, society, natural, history, was, thus, only, meaningful, in, relation, to, human, history, in, his, view, philosophical, materialism, resulted, from, a, lack, of, critical, thought, and, could, not, be, said, to, oppose, religious, dogma, and, superstition, despite, this, gramsci, resigned, himself, to, the, existence, of, this, arguably, cruder, form, of, marxism, marxism, was, a, philosophy, for, the, proletariat, a, subaltern, class, and, thus, could, often, only, be, expressed, in, the, form, of, popular, superstition, and, common, sense, nonetheless, it, was, necessary, to, effectively, challenge, the, ideologies, of, the, educated, classes, and, to, do, so, marxists, must, present, their, philosophy, in, a, more, sophisticated, guise, and, attempt, to, genuinely, understand, their, opponents, views, according, to, the, american, socialist, magazine, jacobin, gramsci, is, one, of, the, most, cited, italian, authors, certainly, the, most, cited, italian, marxist, ever, and, one, of, the, most, celebrated, marxist, philosophers, of, the, twentieth, century, adding, that, the, prison, notebooks, allowed, his, unorthodox, marxism, to, spread, worldwide, gramsci, s, thought, emanates, from, the, organised, political, left, but, has, also, become, an, important, figure, in, current, academic, discussions, within, cultural, studies, and, critical, theory, political, theorists, from, the, political, centre, and, the, political, right, have, also, found, insight, into, his, concepts, for, instance, his, idea, of, hegemony, has, become, widely, cited, his, influence, is, particularly, strong, in, contemporary, political, science, such, as, neo, gramscianism, his, critics, charge, him, with, fostering, a, notion, of, power, struggle, through, ideas, they, find, the, gramscian, approach, to, philosophical, analysis, reflected, in, current, academic, controversies, to, be, in, conflict, with, open, ended, liberal, inquiry, grounded, in, apolitical, readings, of, the, classics, of, western, culture, as, a, socialist, gramsci, s, legacy, has, been, met, with, a, mixed, reception, 6, 7, togliatti, who, led, the, party, renamed, in, 1943, as, the, italian, communist, party, pci, after, world, war, ii, and, whose, gradualist, approach, was, a, forerunner, to, eurocommunism, stated, that, the, pci, s, practices, during, this, period, were, congruent, with, gramscian, thought, it, is, speculated, that, he, would, likely, have, been, expelled, from, his, party, if, his, true, views, had, been, known, particularly, his, growing, hostility, towards, joseph, stalin, one, issue, for, gramsci, related, to, his, speaking, on, topics, of, violence, and, when, it, might, be, justified, or, not, when, the, socialist, giacomo, matteotti, was, murdered, gramsci, did, not, condemn, the, murder, matteotti, had, already, called, for, the, rule, of, law, and, had, been, murdered, by, the, fascists, for, that, stance, the, murder, produced, a, crisis, for, the, italian, fascist, regime, that, gramsci, could, have, exploited, the, historian, jean, yves, fr, tign, argues, that, gramsci, and, the, socialists, more, generally, were, na, ve, in, their, assessment, of, the, fascists, and, as, a, result, underestimated, the, brutality, of, which, the, regime, was, capable, in, thailand, thai, academic, democratic, activist, and, former, secretary, general, of, future, forward, party, piyabutr, saengkanokkul, cited, gramsci, s, idea, as, main, key, to, established, a, party, like, fellow, turinese, and, communist, palmiro, togliatti, gramsci, took, an, interest, in, association, football, which, was, becoming, a, sport, with, massive, following, and, was, elected, by, the, fascist, regime, in, italy, as, a, national, sport, and, was, said, to, have, been, a, supporter, of, juventus, as, were, other, notable, communist, and, left, wing, leaders, on, 16, december, 1988, the, pci, s, newspaper, l, unit, published, an, article, on, the, front, page, titled, gramsci, was, rooting, for, juve, signed, by, giorgio, fabre, it, contained, some, letters, in, which, gramsci, asked, piero, sraffa, for, news, from, our, juventus, even, though, those, letters, later, turned, out, to, be, false, the, article, remains, part, of, the, gramscian, bibliography, and, triggered, numerous, reactions, including, from, giampiero, boniperti, who, on, behalf, of, the, club, the, following, day, told, at, la, stampa, we, are, pleased, to, know, that, among, our, fans, there, have, been, personalities, who, have, marked, an, era, from, the, political, economic, and, intellectual, point, of, view, this, shows, that, juventus, truly, have, something, special, a, charm, that, has, never, lost, strength, over, the, years, gramsci, s, interest, in, football, dates, back, to, a, 16, august, 1918, article, for, the, psi, s, newspaper, avanti, titled, football, and, scopone, fifteen, years, later, he, pointed, at, the, degeneration, of, stadium, cheering, which, emerged, with, the, advent, of, fascism, and, the, consequent, nationalisation, of, the, sport, that, he, said, extinguished, political, and, trade, union, commitment
