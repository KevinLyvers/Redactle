the, 1830s, the, west, encompassed, today, s, midwestern, states, the, harsh, winter, of, 1836, 1837, and, the, financial, crisis, that, developed, soon, after, made, many, new, yorkers, homeless,

songs, were, sung, at, mass, meetings, many, organized, and, led, by, greeley, according, to, biographer, robert, c, williams, greeley, s, lyrics, swept, the, country, and, roused, whig, voters, to, action, funds, raised, by, weed, helped, distribute, the, log, cabin, widely, harrison, and, his, running, mate, john, tyler, were, easily, elected, by, the, end, of, the, 1840, campaign, the, log, cabin, s, circulation, had, risen, to, 80, 000, and, greeley, decided, to, establish, a, daily, newspaper, the, new, york, tribune, at, the, time, new, york, had, many, newspapers, dominated, by, james, gordon, bennett, s, new, york, herald, which, with, a, circulation, of, about, 55, 000, had, more, readers, than, its, combined, competition, as, technology, advanced, it, became, cheaper, and, easier, to, publish, a, newspaper, and, the, daily, press, came, to, dominate, the, weekly, which, had, once, been, the, more, common, format, for, news, periodicals, greeley, borrowed, money, from, friends, to, get, started, and, published, the, first, issue, of, the, tribune, on, april, 10, 1841, the, day, of, a, memorial, parade, in, new, york, for, president, harrison, who, had, died, after, a, month, in, office, and, been, replaced, by, vice, president, tyler, in, the, first, issue, greeley, promised, that, his, newspaper, would, be, a, new, morning, journal, of, politics, literature, and, general, intelligence, new, yorkers, were, not, initially, receptive, the, first, week, s, receipts, were, 92, and, expenses, 525, the, paper, was, sold, for, a, cent, a, copy, by, newsboys, who, purchased, bundles, of, papers, at, a, discount, the, price, of, advertising, was, initially, four, cents, a, line, but, was, quickly, raised, to, six, cents, through, the, 1840s, the, tribune, was, four, pages, that, is, a, single, sheet, folded, it, initially, had, 600, subscribers, and, 5, 000, copies, were, sold, of, the, first, issue, in, the, early, days, greeley, s, chief, assistant, was, henry, j, raymond, who, a, decade, later, founded, the, new, york, times, to, place, the, tribune, on, a, sound, financial, footing, greeley, sold, a, half, interest, in, it, to, attorney, thomas, mcelrath, 1807, 1888, who, became, publisher, of, the, tribune, greeley, was, editor, and, ran, the, business, side, politically, the, tribune, backed, kentucky, senator, henry, clay, who, had, unsuccessfully, sought, the, presidential, nomination, that, fell, to, harrison, and, supported, clay, s, american, system, for, development, of, the, country, greeley, was, one, of, the, first, newspaper, editors, to, have, a, full, time, correspondent, in, washington, an, innovation, quickly, followed, by, his, rivals, part, of, greeley, s, strategy, was, to, make, the, tribune, a, newspaper, of, national, scope, not, merely, local, one, factor, in, establishing, the, paper, nationally, was, the, weekly, tribune, created, in, september, 1841, when, the, log, cabin, and, the, new, yorker, were, merged, with, an, initial, subscription, price, of, 2, a, year, this, was, sent, to, many, across, the, united, states, by, mail, and, was, especially, popular, in, the, midwest, in, december, 1841, greeley, was, offered, the, editorship, of, the, national, whig, newspaper, the, madisonian, he, demanded, full, control, and, declined, when, not, given, it, greeley, in, his, paper, initially, supported, the, whig, program, as, divisions, between, clay, and, president, tyler, became, apparent, he, supported, the, kentucky, senator, and, looked, to, a, clay, nomination, for, president, in, 1844, however, when, clay, was, nominated, by, the, whigs, he, was, defeated, by, the, democrat, former, tennessee, governor, james, k, polk, though, greeley, worked, hard, on, clay, s, behalf, greeley, had, taken, positions, in, opposition, to, slavery, as, editor, of, the, new, yorker, in, the, late, 1830s, opposing, the, annexation, of, the, slaveholding, republic, of, texas, to, the, united, states, in, the, 1840s, greeley, became, an, increasingly, vocal, opponent, of, the, expansion, of, slavery, greeley, hired, margaret, fuller, in, 1844, as, first, literary, editor, of, the, tribune, for, which, she, wrote, over, 200, articles, she, lived, with, the, greeley, family, for, several, years, and, when, she, moved, to, italy, he, made, her, a, foreign, correspondent, he, promoted, the, work, of, henry, david, thoreau, serving, as, literary, agent, and, seeing, to, it, that, thoreau, s, work, was, published, ralph, waldo, emerson, also, benefited, from, greeley, s, promotion, historian, allan, nevins, explained, the, tribune, set, a, new, standard, in, american, journalism, by, its, combination, of, energy, in, newsgathering, with, good, taste, high, moral, standards, and, intellectual, appeal, police, reports, scandals, dubious, medical, advertisements, and, flippant, personalities, were, barred, from, its, pages, the, editorials, were, vigorous, but, usually, temperate, the, political, news, was, the, most, exact, in, the, city, book, reviews, and, book, extracts, were, numerous, and, as, an, inveterate, lecturer, greeley, gave, generous, space, to, lectures, the, paper, appealed, to, substantial, and, thoughtful, people, greeley, who, had, met, his, wife, at, a, graham, boarding, house, became, enthusiastic, about, other, social, movements, that, did, not, last, and, promoted, them, in, his, paper, he, subscribed, to, the, views, of, charles, fourier, a, french, social, thinker, then, recently, deceased, who, proposed, the, establishment, of, settlements, called, phalanxes, with, a, given, number, of, people, from, various, walks, of, life, who, would, function, as, a, corporation, and, among, whose, members, profits, would, be, shared, greeley, in, addition, to, promoting, fourierism, in, the, tribune, was, associated, with, two, such, settlements, both, of, which, eventually, failed, though, the, town, that, eventually, developed, on, the, site, of, the, one, in, pennsylvania, was, after, his, death, renamed, greeley, in, november, 1848, congressman, david, s, jackson, a, democrat, of, new, york, s, 6th, district, was, unseated, for, election, fraud, jackson, s, term, was, to, expire, in, march, 1849, but, during, the, 19th, century, congress, convened, annually, in, december, making, it, important, to, fill, the, seat, under, the, laws, then, in, force, the, whig, committee, from, the, sixth, district, chose, greeley, to, run, in, the, special, election, for, the, remainder, of, the, term, though, they, did, not, select, him, as, their, candidate, for, the, seat, in, the, following, congress, the, sixth, district, or, sixth, ward, as, it, was, commonly, called, was, mostly, irish, american, and, greeley, proclaimed, his, support, for, irish, efforts, towards, independence, from, the, united, kingdom, he, easily, won, the, november, election, and, took, his, seat, when, congress, convened, in, december, 1848, greeley, s, selection, was, procured, by, the, influence, of, his, ally, thurlow, weed, as, a, congressman, for, three, months, greeley, introduced, legislation, for, a, homestead, act, that, would, allow, settlers, who, improved, land, to, purchase, it, at, low, rates, a, fourth, of, what, speculators, would, pay, he, was, quickly, noticed, because, he, launched, a, series, of, attacks, on, legislative, privileges, taking, note, of, which, congressmen, were, missing, votes, and, questioning, the, office, of, house, chaplain, this, was, enough, to, make, him, unpopular, but, he, outraged, his, colleagues, when, on, december, 22, 1848, the, tribune, published, evidence, that, many, congressmen, had, been, paid, excessive, sums, as, travel, allowance, in, january, 1849, greeley, supported, a, bill, that, would, have, corrected, the, issue, but, it, was, defeated, he, was, so, disliked, he, wrote, a, friend, that, he, had, divided, the, house, into, two, parties, one, that, would, like, to, see, me, extinguished, and, the, other, that, wouldn, t, be, satisfied, without, a, hand, in, doing, it, other, legislation, introduced, by, greeley, all, of, which, failed, included, attempts, to, end, flogging, in, the, navy, and, to, ban, alcohol, from, its, ships, he, tried, to, change, the, name, of, the, united, states, to, columbia, abolish, slavery, in, the, district, of, columbia, and, increase, tariffs, one, lasting, effect, of, the, term, of, congressman, greeley, was, his, friendship, with, a, fellow, whig, serving, his, only, term, in, the, house, illinois, s, abraham, lincoln, greeley, s, term, ended, after, march, 3, 1849, and, he, returned, to, new, york, and, the, tribune, having, according, to, williams, failed, to, achieve, much, except, notoriety, by, the, end, of, the, 1840s, greeley, s, tribune, was, not, only, solidly, established, in, new, york, as, a, daily, paper, it, was, highly, influential, nationally, through, its, weekly, edition, which, circulated, in, rural, areas, and, small, towns, journalist, bayard, taylor, deemed, its, influence, in, the, midwest, second, only, to, that, of, the, bible, according, to, williams, the, tribune, could, mold, public, opinion, through, greeley, s, editorials, more, effectively, than, could, the, president, greeley, sharpened, those, skills, over, time, laying, down, what, future, secretary, of, state, john, hay, who, worked, for, the, tribune, in, the, 1870s, deemed, the, gospel, according, to, st, horace, the, tribune, remained, a, whig, paper, but, greeley, took, an, independent, course, in, 1848, he, had, been, slow, to, endorse, the, whig, presidential, nominee, general, zachary, taylor, a, louisianan, and, hero, of, the, mexican, american, war, greeley, opposed, both, the, war, and, the, expansion, of, slavery, into, the, new, territories, seized, from, mexico, and, feared, taylor, would, support, expansion, as, president, greeley, considered, endorsing, former, president, martin, van, buren, candidate, of, the, free, soil, party, but, finally, endorsed, taylor, who, was, elected, the, editor, was, rewarded, for, his, loyalty, with, the, congressional, term, greeley, vacillated, on, support, for, the, compromise, of, 1850, which, gave, victories, to, both, sides, of, the, slavery, issue, before, finally, opposing, it, in, the, 1852, presidential, campaign, he, supported, the, whig, candidate, general, winfield, scott, but, savaged, the, whig, platform, for, its, support, of, the, compromise, we, defy, it, execrate, it, spit, upon, it, such, party, divisions, contributed, to, scott, s, defeat, by, former, new, hampshire, senator, franklin, pierce, in, 1853, with, the, party, increasingly, divided, over, the, slavery, issue, greeley, printed, an, editorial, disclaiming, the, paper, s, identity, as, whig, and, declaring, it, to, be, nonpartisan, he, was, confident, that, the, paper, would, not, suffer, financially, trusting, in, reader, loyalty, some, in, the, party, were, not, sorry, to, see, him, go, the, republic, a, whig, organ, mocked, greeley, and, his, beliefs, if, a, party, is, to, be, built, up, and, maintained, on, fourierism, mesmerism, maine, liquor, laws, spiritual, rappings, kossuthism, socialism, abolitionism, and, forty, other, isms, we, have, no, disposition, to, mix, with, any, such, companions, when, in, 1854, illinois, senator, stephen, douglas, introduced, his, kansas, nebraska, bill, allowing, residents, of, each, territory, to, decide, whether, it, would, be, slave, or, free, greeley, strongly, fought, the, legislation, in, his, newspaper, after, it, passed, and, the, border, war, broke, out, in, kansas, territory, greeley, was, part, of, efforts, to, send, free, state, settlers, there, and, to, arm, them, in, return, proponents, of, slavery, recognized, greeley, and, the, tribune, as, adversaries, stopping, shipments, of, the, paper, to, the, south, and, harassing, local, agents, nevertheless, by, 1858, the, tribune, reached, 300, 000, subscribers, through, the, weekly, edition, and, it, would, continue, as, the, foremost, american, newspaper, through, the, years, of, the, civil, war, the, kansas, nebraska, act, helped, destroy, the, whig, party, but, a, new, party, with, opposition, to, the, spread, of, slavery, at, its, heart, had, been, under, discussion, for, some, years, beginning, in, 1853, greeley, participated, in, the, discussions, that, led, to, the, founding, of, the, republican, party, and, may, have, coined, its, name, greeley, attended, the, first, new, york, state, republican, convention, in, 1854, and, was, disappointed, not, to, be, nominated, either, for, governor, or, lieutenant, governor, the, switch, in, parties, coincided, with, the, end, of, two, of, his, longtime, political, alliances, in, december, 1854, greeley, wrote, that, the, political, partnership, between, weed, william, seward, who, was, by, then, senator, after, serving, as, governor, and, himself, was, ended, by, the, withdrawal, of, the, junior, partner, greeley, was, angered, over, patronage, disputes, and, felt, that, seward, was, courting, the, rival, the, new, york, times, for, support, in, 1853, greeley, purchased, a, farm, in, rural, chappaqua, new, york, where, he, experimented, with, farming, techniques, in, 1856, he, designed, and, built, rehoboth, one, of, the, first, concrete, structures, in, the, united, states, in, 1856, greeley, published, a, campaign, biography, by, an, anonymous, author, for, the, first, republican, presidential, candidate, john, c, fr, mont, the, tribune, continued, to, print, a, wide, variety, of, material, in, 1851, its, managing, editor, charles, a, dana, recruited, karl, marx, as, a, foreign, correspondent, in, london, marx, collaborated, with, friedrich, engels, on, his, work, for, the, tribune, which, continued, for, over, a, decade, covering, 500, articles, greeley, felt, compelled, to, print, mr, marx, has, very, decided, opinions, of, his, own, with, some, of, which, we, are, far, from, agreeing, but, those, who, do, not, read, his, letters, are, neglecting, one, of, the, most, instructive, sources, of, information, on, the, great, questions, of, current, european, politics, greeley, sponsored, a, host, of, reforms, including, pacifism, and, feminism, and, especially, the, ideal, of, the, hard, working, free, laborer, greeley, demanded, reforms, to, make, all, citizens, free, and, equal, he, envisioned, virtuous, citizens, who, would, eradicate, corruption, he, talked, endlessly, about, progress, improvement, and, freedom, while, calling, for, harmony, between, labor, and, capital, greeley, s, editorials, promoted, social, democratic, reforms, and, were, widely, reprinted, they, influenced, the, free, labor, ideology, of, the, whigs, and, the, radical, wing, of, the, republican, party, especially, in, promoting, the, free, labor, ideology, before, 1848, he, sponsored, an, american, version, of, fourierist, socialist, reform, but, backed, away, after, the, failed, revolutions, of, 1848, in, europe, to, promote, multiple, reforms, greeley, hired, a, roster, of, writers, who, later, became, famous, in, their, own, right, including, margaret, fuller, charles, a, dana, george,

literary, critic, jane, swisshelm, was, one, of, the, first, women, hired, by, a, major, newspaper, in, 1859, greeley, traveled, across, the, continent, to, see, the, west, for, himself, to, write, about, it, for, the, tribune, and, to, publicize, the, need, for, a, transcontinental, railroad, he, also, planned, to, give, speeches, to, promote, the, republican, party, in, may, 1859, he, went, to, chicago, and, then, to, lawrence, in, kansas, territory, and, was, unimpressed, by, the, local, people, nevertheless, after, speaking, before, the, first, ever, kansas, republican, party, convention, at, osawatomie, kansas, greeley, took, one, of, the, first, stagecoaches, to, denver, seeing, the, town, then, in, course, of, formation, as, a, mining, camp, of, the, pike, s, peak, gold, rush, sending, dispatches, back, to, the, tribune, greeley, took, the, overland, trail, reaching, salt, lake, city, where, he, conducted, a, two, hour, interview, with, the, mormon, leader, brigham, young, the, first, newspaper, interview, young, had, given, greeley, encountered, native, americans, and, was, sympathetic, but, like, many, of, his, time, deemed, indian, culture, inferior, in, california, he, toured, widely, and, gave, many, addresses, although, he, remained, on, cordial, terms, with, senator, seward, greeley, never, seriously, considered, supporting, him, in, his, bid, for, the, republican, nomination, for, president, instead, during, the, run, up, to, the, 1860, republican, national, convention, in, chicago, he, pressed, the, candidacy, of, former, missouri, representative, edward, bates, an, opponent, of, the, spread, of, slavery, who, had, freed, his, own, slaves, in, his, newspaper, in, speeches, and, in, conversation, greeley, pushed, bates, as, a, man, who, could, win, the, north, and, even, make, inroads, in, the, south, nevertheless, when, one, of, the, dark, horse, candidates, for, the, republican, nomination, abraham, lincoln, came, to, new, york, to, give, an, address, at, cooper, union, greeley, urged, his, readers, to, go, hear, lincoln, and, was, among, those, who, accompanied, him, to, the, platform, greeley, thought, of, lincoln, as, a, possible, nominee, for, vice, president, greeley, attended, the, convention, as, a, substitute, for, oregon, delegate, leander, holmes, who, was, unable, to, attend, in, chicago, he, promoted, bates, but, deemed, his, cause, hopeless, and, felt, that, seward, would, be, nominated, in, conversations, with, other, delegates, he, predicted, that, if, nominated, seward, could, not, carry, crucial, battleground, states, such, as, pennsylvania, greeley, s, estrangement, from, seward, was, not, widely, known, giving, the, editor, more, credibility, greeley, and, seward, biographer, glyndon, g, van, deusen, noted, that, it, is, uncertain, how, great, a, part, greeley, played, in, seward, s, defeat, by, lincoln, he, had, little, success, gaining, delegates, for, bates, on, the, first, two, ballots, seward, led, lincoln, but, on, the, second, only, by, a, small, margin, after, the, third, ballot, on, which, lincoln, was, nominated, greeley, was, seen, among, the, oregon, delegation, a, broad, smile, on, his, face, according, to, pulitzer, prize, winning, historian, doris, kearns, goodwin, it, is, hard, to, imagine, lincoln, letting, greeley, s, resentment, smolder, for, years, as, seward, did, seward, s, forces, made, greeley, a, target, of, their, anger, at, the, senator, s, defeat, one, subscriber, cancelled, regretting, the, three, cent, stamp, he, had, to, use, on, the, letter, greeley, supplied, a, replacement, when, he, was, attacked, in, print, greeley, responded, in, kind, he, launched, a, campaign, against, corruption, in, the, new, york, legislature, hoping, voters, would, defeat, incumbents, and, the, new, legislators, would, elect, him, to, the, senate, when, seward, s, term, expired, in, 1861, before, 1913, senators, were, elected, by, state, legislatures, but, his, main, activity, during, the, campaign, of, 1860, was, boosting, lincoln, and, denigrating, the, other, presidential, candidates, he, made, it, clear, that, a, republican, administration, would, not, interfere, with, slavery, where, it, already, was, and, denied, that, lincoln, was, in, favor, of, voting, rights, for, african, americans, he, kept, up, the, pressure, until, lincoln, was, elected, in, november, lincoln, soon, let, it, be, known, that, seward, would, be, secretary, of, state, which, meant, that, he, would, not, be, a, candidate, for, re, election, to, the, senate, weed, wanted, william, m, evarts, elected, in, his, place, while, the, anti, seward, forces, in, new, york, gathered, around, greeley, the, crucial, battleground, was, the, republican, caucus, as, the, party, held, the, majority, in, the, legislature, greeley, s, forces, did, not, have, enough, votes, to, send, him, to, the, senate, but, they, had, enough, strength, to, block, evarts, s, candidacy, weed, threw, his, support, to, ira, harris, who, had, already, received, several, votes, and, who, was, chosen, by, the, caucus, and, elected, by, the, legislature, in, february, 1861, weed, was, content, to, have, blocked, the, editor, and, stated, that, he, had, paid, the, first, installment, on, a, large, debt, to, mr, greeley, after, lincoln, s, election, there, was, talk, of, secession, in, the, south, the, tribune, was, initially, in, favor, of, peaceful, separation, with, the, south, becoming, a, separate, nation, according, to, an, editorial, on, november, 9, if, the, cotton, states, shall, become, satisfied, that, they, can, do, better, out, of, the, union, than, in, it, we, insist, on, letting, them, go, in, peace, the, right, to, secede, may, be, a, revolutionary, one, but, it, exists, nevertheless, and, whenever, a, considerable, section, of, our, union, shall, deliberately, resolve, to, go, out, we, shall, resist, all, coercive, measures, designed, to, keep, it, in, we, hope, never, to, live, in, a, republic, whereof, one, section, is, pinned, to, the, residue, by, bayonets, similar, editorials, appeared, through, january, 1861, after, which, tribune, editorials, took, a, hard, line, on, the, south, opposing, concessions, williams, concludes, that, for, a, brief, moment, horace, greeley, had, believed, that, peaceful, secession, might, be, a, form, of, freedom, preferable, to, civil, war, this, brief, flirtation, with, disunion, would, have, consequences, for, greeley, it, was, used, against, him, when, he, ran, for, president, in, 1872, in, the, days, leading, up, to, lincoln, s, inauguration, the, tribune, headed, its, editorial, columns, each, day, in, large, capital, letters, no, compromise, no, concession, to, traitors, the, constitution, as, it, is, greeley, attended, the, inauguration, sitting, close, to, senator, douglas, as, the, tribune, hailed, the, beginning, of, lincoln, s, presidency, when, southern, forces, attacked, fort, sumter, the, tribune, regretted, the, loss, of, the, fort, but, applauded, the, fact, that, war, to, subdue, the, rebels, who, formed, the, confederate, states, of, america, would, now, take, place, the, paper, criticized, lincoln, for, not, being, quick, to, use, force, through, the, spring, and, early, summer, of, 1861, greeley, and, the, tribune, beat, the, drum, for, a, union, attack, on, to, richmond, a, phrase, coined, by, a, tribune, stringer, became, the, watchword, of, the, newspaper, as, greeley, urged, the, occupation, of, the, rebel, capital, of, richmond, before, the, confederate, congress, could, meet, on, july, 20, in, part, because, of, the, public, pressure, in, mid, july, lincoln, sent, the, half, trained, union, army, into, the, field, at, the, first, battle, of, bull, run, where, it, was, soundly, beaten, the, defeat, threw, greeley, into, despair, and, he, may, have, suffered, a, nervous, breakdown, restored, to, health, by, two, weeks, at, the, farm, he, had, purchased, in, chappaqua, greeley, returned, to, the, tribune, and, a, policy, of, general, backing, of, the, lincoln, administration, even, having, kind, words, to, say, about, secretary, seward, his, old, foe, he, was, supportive, even, during, the, military, defeats, of, the, first, year, of, the, war, late, in, 1861, he, proposed, to, lincoln, through, an, intermediary, that, the, president, provide, him, with, advance, information, as, to, its, policies, in, exchange, for, friendly, coverage, in, the, tribune, lincoln, eagerly, accepted, having, him, firmly, behind, me, will, be, as, helpful, to, me, as, an, army, of, one, hundred, thousand, men, by, early, 1862, however, greeley, was, again, sometimes, critical, of, the, administration, frustrated, by, the, failure, to, win, decisive, military, victories, and, perturbed, at, the, president, s, slowness, to, commit, to, the, emancipation, of, the, slaves, once, the, confederacy, was, defeated, something, the, tribune, was, urging, in, its, editorials, this, was, a, change, in, greeley, s, thinking, which, began, after, first, manassas, a, shift, from, preservation, of, the, union, being, the, primary, war, purpose, to, wanting, the, war, to, end, slavery, by, march, the, only, action, against, slavery, that, lincoln, had, backed, was, a, proposal, for, compensated, emancipation, in, the, border, states, that, had, remained, loyal, to, the, union, though, he, signed, legislation, abolishing, slavery, in, the, district, of, columbia, lincoln, supposedly, asked, a, tribune, correspondent, what, in, the, world, is, the, matter, with, uncle, horace, why, can, t, he, restrain, himself, and, wait, a, little, while, greeley, s, prodding, of, lincoln, culminated, in, a, letter, to, him, on, august, 19, 1862, reprinted, on, the, following, day, in, the, tribune, as, the, prayer, of, twenty, millions, by, this, time, lincoln, had, informed, his, cabinet, of, the, preliminary, emancipation, proclamation, he, had, composed, and, greeley, was, told, of, it, the, same, day, the, prayer, was, printed, in, his, letter, greeley, demanded, action, on, emancipation, and, strict, enforcement, of, the, confiscation, acts, lincoln, must, fight, slavery, with, liberty, and, not, fight, wolves, with, the, devices, of, a, sheep, lincoln, s, reply, would, become, famous, much, more, so, than, the, prayer, that, provoked, it, my, paramount, object, in, this, struggle, is, to, save, the, union, and, is, not, either, to, save, or, to, destroy, slavery, if, i, could, save, the, union, without, freeing, any, slave, i, would, do, it, and, if, i, could, save, it, by, freeing, all, the, slaves, i, would, do, it, and, if, i, could, save, it, by, freeing, some, and, leaving, others, alone, i, would, also, do, that, what, i, do, about, slavery, and, the, colored, race, i, do, because, it, helps, to, save, the, union, and, what, i, forbear, i, forbear, because, i, do, not, believe, it, would, help, to, save, the, union, lincoln, s, statement, angered, abolitionists, william, seward, s, wife, frances, complained, to, her, husband, that, lincoln, had, made, it, seem, that, the, mere, keeping, together, a, number, of, states, is, more, important, than, human, freedom, greeley, felt, lincoln, had, not, truly, answered, him, but, i, ll, forgive, him, everything, if, he, ll, issue, the, proclamation, when, lincoln, did, on, september, 22, greeley, hailed, the, emancipation, proclamation, as, a, great, boon, of, freedom, according, to, williams, lincoln, s, war, for, union, was, now, also, greeley, s, war, for, emancipation, after, the, union, victory, at, gettysburg, in, early, july, 1863, the, tribune, wrote, that, the, rebellion, would, be, quickly, stamped, out, a, week, after, the, battle, the, new, york, city, draft, riots, erupted, greeley, and, the, tribune, were, generally, supportive, of, conscription, though, feeling, that, the, rich, should, not, be, allowed, to, evade, it, by, hiring, substitutes, support, for, the, draft, made, them, targets, of, the, mob, and, the, tribune, building, was, surrounded, and, at, least, once, invaded, greeley, secured, arms, from, the, brooklyn, navy, yard, and, 150, soldiers, kept, the, building, secure, mary, greeley, and, her, children, were, at, the, farm, in, chappaqua, a, mob, threatened, them, but, dispersed, without, doing, harm, in, august, 1863, greeley, was, requested, by, a, firm, of, hartford, publishers, to, write, a, history, of, the, war, greeley, agreed, and, over, the, next, eight, months, he, penned, a, 600, page, volume, which, would, be, the, first, of, two, entitled, the, american, conflict, the, books, were, very, successful, selling, a, total, of, 225, 000, copies, by, 1870, a, large, sale, for, the, time, throughout, the, war, greeley, played, with, ideas, as, to, how, to, settle, it, in, 1862, greeley, had, approached, the, french, minister, to, washington, henri, mercier, to, discuss, a, mediated, settlement, however, seward, rejected, such, talks, and, the, prospect, of, european, intervention, receded, after, the, bloody, union, victory, at, antietam, in, september, 1862, in, july, 1864, greeley, received, word, that, there, were, confederate, commissioners, in, canada, empowered, to, offer, peace, in, fact, the, men, were, in, niagara, falls, canada, in, order, to, aid, peace, democrats, and, otherwise, undermine, the, union, war, effort, but, they, played, along, when, greeley, journeyed, to, niagara, falls, at, lincoln, s, request, the, president, was, willing, to, consider, any, deal, that, included, reunion, and, emancipation, the, confederates, had, no, credentials, and, were, unwilling, to, accompany, greeley, to, washington, under, safe, conduct, greeley, returned, to, new, york, and, the, episode, when, it, became, public, embarrassed, the, administration, lincoln, said, nothing, publicly, concerning, greeley, s, credulous, conduct, but, he, privately, indicated, that, he, had, no, confidence, in, him, anymore, greeley, did, not, initially, support, lincoln, for, nomination, in, 1864, casting, about, for, other, candidates, in, february, he, wrote, in, the, tribune, that, lincoln, could, not, be, elected, to, a, second, term, nevertheless, no, candidate, made, a, serious, challenge, to, lincoln, and, lincoln, was, nominated, in, june, which, the, tribune, applauded, slightly, in, august, fearing, a, democratic, victory, and, acceptance, of, the, confederacy, greeley, engaged, in, a, plot, to, get, a, new, convention, to, nominate, another, candidate, with, lincoln, withdrawing, the, plot, came, to, nothing, once, atlanta, was, taken, by, union, forces, on, september, 3, greeley, became, a, fervent, supporter, of, lincoln, greeley, was, gratified, by, both, lincoln, s, re, election, and, continued, union, victories, as, the, war, drew, to, a, close, in, april, 1865, greeley, and, the, tribune, urged, magnanimity, towards, the, defeated, confederates, arguing, that, making, martyrs, of, confederate, leaders, would, only, inspire, future, rebels, this, talk, of, moderation, ceased, when, lincoln, was, assassinated, by, john, wilkes, booth, many, concluded, that, lincoln, had, fallen, as, the, result, of, a, final, rebel, plot, and, the, new, president, andrew, johnson, offered, 100, 000, for, the, capture, of, fugitive, confederate, president, jefferson, davis, after, the, rebel, leader, was, caught, greeley, initially, advocated, that, punishment, be, meted, out, in, accord, with, a, just, verdict, through, 1866, greeley, editorialized, that, davis, who, was, being, held, at, fortress, monroe, should, either, be, set, free, or, put, on, trial, davis, s, wife, varina, urged, greeley, to, use, his, influence, to, gain, her, husband, s, release, in, may, 1867, a, richmond, judge, set, bail, for, the, former, confederate, president, at, 100, 000, 1, 79, million, in, 2023, greeley, was, among, those, who, signed, the, bail, bond, and, the, two, men, met, briefly, at, the, courthouse, this, act, resulted, in, public, anger, against, greeley, in, the, north, sales, of, the, second, volume, of, his, history, published, in, 1866, declined, sharply, subscriptions, to, the, tribune, especially, the, weekly, tribune, also, dropped, off, though, they, recovered, during, the, 1868, election, initially, supportive, of, andrew, johnson, s, lenient, reconstruction, policies, greeley, soon, became, disillusioned, as, the, president, s, plan, allowed, the, quick, formation, of, state, governments, without, securing, suffrage, for, the, freedman, when, congress, convened, in, december, 1865, and, gradually, took, control, of, reconstruction, he, was, generally, supportive, as, radical, republicans, pushed, hard, for, universal, male, suffrage, and, civil, rights, for, freedmen, greeley, ran, for, congress, in, 1866, but, lost, badly, he, ran, for, senate, in, the, legislative, election, held, in, early, 1867, but, lost, to, roscoe, conkling, as, the, president, and, congress, battled, greeley, remained, firmly, opposed, to, the, president, and, when, johnson, was, impeached, in, march, 1868, greeley, and, the, tribune, strongly, supported, his, removal, attacking, johnson, as, an, aching, tooth, in, the, national, jaw, a, screeching, infant, in, a, crowded, lecture, room, and, declaring, there, can, be, no, peace, or, comfort, till, he, is, out, nevertheless, the, president, was, acquitted, by, the, senate, much, to, greeley, s, disappointment, also, in, 1868, greeley, sought, the, republican, nomination, for, governor, but, was, frustrated, by, the, conkling, forces, greeley, supported, the, successful, republican, presidential, nominee, general, ulysses, s, grant, in, the, 1868, election, in, 1868, whitelaw, reid, joined, the, tribune, s, staff, as, managing, editor, in, reid, greeley, found, a, reliable, second, in, command, also, on, the, tribune, s, staff, in, the, late, 1860s, was, mark, twain, henry, george, sometimes, contributed, pieces, as, did, bret, harte, in, 1870, john, hay, joined, the, staff, as, an, editorial, writer, greeley, soon, pronounced, hay, the, most, brilliant, at, that, craft, ever, to, write, for, the, tribune, greeley, maintained, his, interest, in, associationism, beginning, in, 1869, he, was, heavily, involved, in, an, attempt, to, found, the, union, colony, of, colorado, a, utopia, on, the, prairie, in, a, scheme, led, by, nathan, meeker, the, new, town, of, greeley, colorado, territory, was, named, after, him, he, served, as, treasurer, and, lent, meeker, money, to, keep, the, colony, afloat, in, 1871, greeley, published, a, book, what, i, know, about, farming, based, on, his, childhood, experience, and, that, from, his, country, home, in, chappaqua, greeley, continued, to, seek, political, office, running, for, state, comptroller, in, 1869, and, the, house, of, representatives, in, 1870, losing, both, times, in, 1870, president, grant, offered, greeley, the, post, of, minister, to, santo, domingo, today, the, dominican, republic, which, he, declined, as, had, been, the, case, for, much, of, the, 19th, century, political, parties, continued, to, be, formed, and, to, vanish, after, the, civil, war, in, september, 1871, missouri, senator, carl, schurz, formed, the, liberal, republican, party, founded, on, opposition, to, president, grant, opposition, to, corruption, and, support, of, civil, service, reform, lower, taxes, and, land, reform, he, gathered, around, him, an, eclectic, group, of, supporters, whose, only, real, link, was, their, opposition, to, grant, whose, administration, had, proved, increasingly, corrupt, the, party, needed, a, candidate, with, a, presidential, election, upcoming, greeley, was, one, of, the, best, known, americans, as, well, as, being, a, perennial, candidate, for, office, he, was, more, minded, to, consider, a, run, for, the, republican, nomination, fearing, the, effect, on, the, tribune, should, he, bolt, the, party, nevertheless, he, wanted, to, be, president, as, a, republican, if, possible, and, if, not, as, a, liberal, republican, the, liberal, republican, national, convention, met, in, cincinnati, in, may, 1872, greeley, was, spoken, of, as, a, possible, candidate, as, was, missouri, governor, benjamin, gratz, brown, schurz, was, ineligible, being, foreign, born, on, the, first, ballot, former, minister, to, britain, charles, francis, adams, led, but, greeley, took, a, narrow, lead, on, a, revised, second, ballot, adams, then, retook, the, lead, but, on, the, sixth, ballot, after, a, spontaneous, demonstration, staged, by, reid, greeley, gained, the, nomination, with, brown, as, the, vice, presidential, candidate, ronald, white, writes, no, one, summed, up, greeley, s, strength, and, weakness, better, than, grant, who, wrote, a, friend, he, is, a, genius, without, common, sense, the, democrats, when, they, met, in, baltimore, in, july, faced, a, stark, choice, nominate, greeley, long, a, thorn, in, their, side, or, split, the, anti, grant, vote, and, go, on, to, certain, defeat, they, chose, the, former, and, even, adopted, the, liberal, republican, platform, which, called, for, equal, rights, for, african, americans, greeley, resigned, as, editor, of, the, tribune, for, the, campaign, and, unusually, for, the, time, embarked, on, a, speaking, tour, to, bring, his, message, to, the, people, as, it, was, customary, for, candidates, for, major, office, not, to, actively, campaign, he, was, attacked, as, a, seeker, after, office, nevertheless, in, late, july, greeley, and, others, such, as, former, ohio, governor, rutherford, b, hayes, thought, he, would, very, likely, be, elected, greeley, campaigned, on, a, platform, of, intersectional, reconciliation, arguing, that, the, war, was, over, and, the, issue, of, slavery, was, resolved, he, asserted, that, it, was, time, to, restore, normalcy, and, end, the, continuing, military, occupation, of, the, south, the, republican, counterattack, was, well, financed, accusing, greeley, of, support, for, everything, from, treason, to, the, ku, klux, klan, the, anti, greeley, campaign, was, famously, and, effectively, summed, up, in, the, cartoons, of, thomas, nast, whom, grant, later, credited, with, a, major, role, in, his, re, election, nast, s, cartoons, showed, greeley, giving, bail, money, for, jefferson, davis, throwing, mud, on, grant, and, shaking, hands, with, john, wilkes, booth, across, lincoln, s, grave, the, cr, dit, mobilier, scandal, corruption, in, the, financing, of, the, union, pacific, railroad, broke, in, september, but, greeley, was, unable, to, take, advantage, of, the, grant, administration, s, ties, to, the, scandal, as, he, had, stock, in, the, railroad, himself, and, some, alleged, it, had, been, given, to, him, in, exchange, for, favorable, coverage, greeley, s, wife, mary, had, returned, ill, from, a, trip, to, europe, in, late, june, her, condition, worsened, in, october, and, he, effectively, broke, off, campaigning, after, october, 12, to, be, with, her, she, died, on, october, 30, plunging, him, into, despair, a, week, before, the, election, poor, results, for, the, democrats, in, those, states, that, had, elections, for, other, offices, in, september, and, october, presaged, defeat, for, greeley, and, so, it, proved, he, received, 2, 834, 125, votes, to, 3, 597, 132, for, grant, who, secured, 286, electors, to, 66, for, greeley, the, editor, turned, candidate, won, only, six, states, out, of, 37, georgia, kentucky, maryland, missouri, tennessee, and, texas, greeley, resumed, editorship, of, the, tribune, but, quickly, learned, that, a, movement, to, unseat, him, was, underway, he, found, himself, unable, to, sleep, and, after, a, final, visit, to, the, tribune, on, november, 13, a, week, after, the, election, he, remained, under, medical, care, at, the, recommendation, of, a, family, physician, greeley, was, sent, to, choate, house, the, asylum, of, dr, george, choate, at, pleasantville, new, york, there, he, continued, to, worsen, and, he, died, on, november, 29, with, his, two, surviving, daughters, and, whitelaw, reid, at, his, side, his, death, came, before, the, electoral, college, balloted, his, 66, electoral, votes, were, divided, among, four, others, principally, indiana, governor, elect, thomas, a, hendricks, and, greeley, s, vice, presidential, running, mate, benjamin, gratz, brown, although, greeley, had, requested, a, simple, funeral, his, daughters, ignored, his, wishes, and, arranged, a, grand, affair, at, the, church, of, the, divine, paternity, later, the, fourth, universalist, society, in, the, city, of, new, york, where, greeley, was, a, member, he, is, buried, in, brooklyn, s, green, wood, cemetery, among, the, mourners, were, old, friends, tribune, employees, including, reid, and, hay, his, journalistic, rivals, and, a, broad, array, of, politicians, led, by, president, grant, despite, the, venom, that, had, been, spewed, over, him, in, the, presidential, campaign, greeley, s, death, was, widely, mourned, harper, s, weekly, which, had, printed, nast, s, cartoons, wrote, since, the, assassination, of, mr, lincoln, the, death, of, no, american, has, been, so, sincerely, deplored, as, that, of, horace, greeley, and, its, tragical, circumstances, have, given, a, peculiarly, affectionate, pathos, to, all, that, has, been, said, of, him, henry, ward, beecher, wrote, in, the, christian, union, when, horace, greeley, died, unjust, and, hard, judgment, of, him, died, also, harriet, beecher, stowe, noted, greeley, s, eccentric, dress, that, poor, white, hat, if, alas, it, covered, many, weaknesses, it, covered, also, much, strength, much, real, kindness, and, benevolence, and, much, that, the, world, will, be, better, for, greeley, supported, liberal, policies, towards, the, fast, growing, western, regions, he, memorably, advised, the, ambitious, to, go, west, young, man, he, hired, karl, marx, because, of, his, interest, in, covering, working, class, society, and, politics, attacked, monopolies, of, all, sorts, and, rejected, land, grants, to,

proposed, historian, iver, bernstein, says, greeley, was, an, eclectic, and, unsystematic, thinker, a, one, man, switchboard, for, the, international, cause, of, reform, he, committed, himself, all, at, once, to, utopian, and, artisan, socialism, to, land, sexual, and, dietary, reform, and, of, course, to, anti, slavery, indeed, greeley, s, great, significance, in, the, culture, and, politics, of, civil, war, era, america, stemmed, from, his, attempt, to, accommodate, intellectually, the, contradictions, inherent, in, the, many, diverse, reform, movements, of, the, time, greeley, s, view, of, freedom, was, based, in, the, desire, that, all, should, have, the, opportunity, to, better, themselves, according, to, his, biographer, erik, s, lunde, a, dedicated, social, reformer, deeply, sympathetic, to, the, treatment, of, poor, white, males, slaves, free, blacks, and, white, women, he, still, espoused, the, virtues, of, self, help, and, free, enterprise, van, deusen, stated, his, genuine, human, sympathies, his, moral, fervor, even, the, exhibitionism, that, was, a, part, of, his, makeup, made, it, inevitable, that, he, should, crusade, for, a, better, world, he, did, so, with, apostolic, zeal, nevertheless, greeley, s, effectiveness, as, a, reformer, was, undermined, by, his, idiosyncrasies, according, to, williams, he, must, have, looked, like, an, apparition, a, man, of, eccentric, habits, dressed, in, an, old, linen, coat, that, made, him, look, like, a, farmer, who, came, into, town, for, supplies, van, deusen, wrote, greeley, s, effectiveness, as, a, crusader, was, limited, by, some, of, his, traits, and, characteristics, culturally, deficient, he, was, to, the, end, ignorant, of, his, own, limitations, and, this, ignorance, was, a, great, handicap, the, tribune, remained, under, that, name, until, 1924, when, it, merged, with, the, new, york, herald, to, become, the, new, york, herald, tribune, which, was, published, until, 1966, the,

concluded, his, biography, of, greeley, more, significant, still, was, the, service, that, greeley, performed, as, a, result, of, his, faith, in, his, country, and, his, countrymen, his, belief, in, infinite, american, progress, for, all, his, faults, and, shortcomings, greeley, symbolized, an, america, that, though, often, shortsighted, and, misled, was, never, suffocated, by, the, wealth, pouring, from, its, farms, and, furnaces, for, through, his, faith, in, the, american, future, a, faith, expressed, in, his, ceaseless, efforts, to, make, real, the, promise, of, america, he, inspired, others, with, hope, and, confidence, making, them, feel, that, their, dreams, also, had, the, substance, of, realty, it, is, his, faith, and, theirs, that, has, given, him, his, place, in, american, history, in, that, faith, he, still, marches, among, us, scolding, and, benevolent, exhorting, us, to, confidence, and, to, victory, in, the, great, struggles, of, our, own, day
