remain, a, centerpiece, of, contemporary, torah, study, a, large, fraction, of, rabbinic, literature, published, since, the, middle, ages, discusses, rashi, either, using, his, view, as, supporting, evidence, or, debating, against, it, his, commentary, on, the, talmud, which, covers, nearly, all, of, the, babylonian, talmud, has, been, included, in, every, edition, of, the, talmud, since, its,

yitzhak, 3, shlomo, yitzhaki, and, myriad, similar, highly, respectful, derivatives, in, older, literature, rashi, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, jarchi, or, yarhi, his, abbreviated, name, being, interpreted, as, r, abbi, sh, lomo, y, arhi, this, was, understood, to, refer, to, the, hebrew, name, of, lunel, in, provence, popularly, derived, from, the, occitan, luna, moon, in, hebrew, in, which, rashi, was, assumed, to, have, lived, at, some, time, or, to, have, been, born, or, where, his, ancestors, were, supposed, to, have, originated, later, christian, writers, richard, simon, and, johann, christoph, wolf, claimed, that, only, christian, scholars, referred, to, rashi, as, jarchi, and, that, this, epithet, was, unknown, to, the, jews, bernardo, de, rossi, however, demonstrated, that, hebrew, scholars, also, referred, to, rashi, as, yarhi, in, 1839, leopold, zunz, showed, that, the, hebrew, usage, of, jarchi, was, an, erroneous, propagation, of, the, error, by, christian,

davidic, line, in, his, voluminous, writings, rashi, himself, made, no, such, claim, at, all, the, main, early, rabbinical, source, about, his, ancestry, responsum, no, 29, by, solomon, luria, makes, no, such, claim, either, his, fame, later, made, him, the, subject, of, many, legends, one, tradition, contends, that, his, parents, were, childless, for, many, years, rashi, s, father, yitzhak, a,

en, route, he, cast, the, gem, into, the, sea, afterwards, he, was, visited, by, either, the, voice, of, god, or, the, prophet, elijah, who, told, him, that, he, would, be, rewarded, with, the, birth, of, a, noble, son, who, would, illuminate, the, world, with, his, torah, knowledge, another, legend, also, states, that, rashi, s, parents, moved, to, worms, germany, while, rashi, s, mother, was, pregnant, as, she, walked, down, one, of, the, narrow, streets, in, the, jewish, quarter, she, was, imperiled, by, two, oncoming, carriages, she, turned, and, pressed, herself, against, a, wall, which, opened, to, receive, her, this, miraculous, niche, is, still, visible, in, the, wall, of, the, worms, synagogue, additional, legends, particularly, in, hasidic, literature, postulate, that, rashi, s, tremendous, works, and, accomplishments, were, inspired, by, the, holy, spirit, the, shekhinah, as, no, mere, human, could, produce, such, immense, works, one, text, goes, so, far, as, to, claim, that, rashi, was, beyond, human, the, author, proposes, that, he, never, died, a, natural, death, but, rather, ascended, to, heaven, alive, like, the, immortal, prophet, elijah, according, to, tradition, rashi, was, first, brought, to, learn, torah, by, his, father, on, shavuot, day, at, the, age, of, five, his, father, was, his, main, torah, teacher, until, his, death, when, rashi, was, still, a, youth, at, the, age, of, 17, he, married, and, soon, after, went, to, learn, in, the, yeshiva, of, yaakov, ben, yakar, in, worms, returning, to, his, wife, three, times, yearly, for, the, days, of, awe, passover, and, shavuot, when, yaakov, died, in, 1064, rashi, continued, learning, in, worms, for, another, year, in, the, yeshiva, of, his, relative, isaac, ben, eliezer, halevi, who, was, also, chief, rabbi, of, worms, then, he, moved, to, mainz, where, he, studied, under, another, of, his, relatives, isaac, ben, judah, the, rabbinic, head, of, mainz, and, one, of, the, leading, sages, of, the, lorraine, region, straddling, france, and, germany, rashi, s, teachers, were, students, of, rabbeinu, gershom, and, eliezer, hagadol, leading, talmudists, of, the, previous, generation, from, his, teachers, rashi, imbibed, the, oral, traditions, pertaining, to, the, talmud, as, they, had, been, passed, down, for, centuries, as, well, as, an, understanding, of, the, talmud, s, logic, and, forms, of, argument, rashi, took, concise, copious, notes, from, what, he, learned, in, yeshiva, incorporating, this, material, in, his, commentaries, he, was, also, greatly, influenced, by, the, exegetical, principles, of, menahem, kara, he, returned, to, troyes, at, the, age, of, 25, after, which, time, his, mother, died, and, he, was, asked, to, join, the, troyes, beth, din, rabbinical, court, he, also, began, answering, halakhic, questions, upon, the, death, of, the, head, of, the, bet, din, zerach, ben, abraham, rashi, assumed, the, court, s, leadership, and, answered, hundreds, of, halakhic, queries, at, some, time, around, 1070, he, founded, a, yeshiva, which, attracted, many, disciples, it, is, thought, by, some, that, rashi, earned, his, living, as, a, vintner, since, rashi, shows, an, extensive, knowledge, of, its, utensils, and, process, but, there, is, no, evidence, for, this, most, scholars, and, a, jewish, oral, tradition, contend, that, he, was, a, vintner, the, only, reason, given, for, the, centuries, old, tradition, that, he, was, a, vintner, being, not, true, is, that, the, soil, in, all, of, troyes, is, not, optimal, for, growing, wine, grapes, claimed, by, the, research, of, haym, soloveitchik, there, exists, a, reference, to, a, seal, said, to, be, from, his, vineyard, although, there, are, many, legends, about, his, travels, rashi, likely, never, went, further, than, from, the, seine, to, the, rhine, his, furthest, destinations, were, the, yeshivas, of, lorraine, in, 1096, the, people, s, crusade, swept, through, the, lorraine, murdering, 12, 000, jews, and, uprooting, whole, communities, among, those, murdered, in, worms, were, the, three, sons, of, isaac, ben, eliezer, halevi, rashi, s, teacher, rashi, wrote, several, selichot, penitential, poems, mourning, the, slaughter, and, the, destruction, of, the, region, s, great, yeshivot, seven, of, rashi, s, selichot, still, exist, including, adonai, elohei, hatz, vaot, which, is, recited, on, the, eve, of, rosh, hashanah, and, az, terem, nimtehu, which, is, recited, on, the, fast, of, gedalia, rashi, died, on, july, 13, 1105, tammuz, 29, 4865, at, the, age, of, 65, he, was, buried, in, troyes, the, approximate, location, of, the, cemetery, in, which, he, was, buried, was, recorded, in, seder, ha, dorot, but, over, time, the, location, of, the, cemetery, was, forgotten, a, number, of, years, ago, a, sorbonne, professor, discovered, an, ancient, map, depicting, the, site, of, the, cemetery, which, lay, under, an, open, square, in, the, city, of, troyes, after, this, discovery, french, jews, erected, a, large, monument, in, the, center, of, the, square, a, large, black, and, white, globe, featuring, the, three, hebrew, letters, of, artfully, arranged, counterclockwise, in, negative, space, evoking, the, style, of, hebrew, microcalligraphy, the, granite, base, of, the, monument, is, engraved, rabbi, shlomo, yitzchaki, commentator, and, guide, in, 2005, yisroel, meir, gabbai, erected, an, additional, plaque, at, this, site, marking, the, square, as, a, burial, ground, the, plaque, reads, the, place, you, are, standing, on, is, the, cemetery, of, the, town, of, troyes, many, rishonim, are, buried, here, among, them, rabbi, shlomo, known, as, rashi, the, holy, may, his, merit, protect, us, rashi, had, no, sons, all, of, his, three, children, were, girls, named, yocheved, miriam, and, rachel, he, invested, himself, in, their, education, his, writings, and, the, legends, which, surround, him, suggest, that, his, daughters, were, well, versed, in, the, torah, and, the, talmud, at, a, time, when, women, were, not, expected, to, study, and, would, help, him, when, he, was, too, weak, to, write, his, daughters, married, his, disciples, most, present, day, ashkenazi, rabbinical, dynasties, can, trace, their, lineage, back, to, his, daughters, miriam, or, yocheved, a, late, 20th, century, legend, claims, that, rashi, s, daughters, wore, tefillin, while, a, few, women, in, medieval, ashkenaz, did, wear, tefillin, there, is, no, evidence, that, rashi, s, daughters, did, it, is, reputed, that, the, famous, polish, talmudist, moses, isserles, 1530, 1572, was, a, descendant, of, rashi, rashi, s, commentary, on, the, tanakh, and, especially, his, commentary, on, the, chumash, is, the, essential, companion, for, any, study, of, the, bible, among, orthodox, jews, drawing, on, the, breadth, of, midrashic, talmudic, and, aggadic, literature, including, literature, that, is, no, longer, extant, as, well, as, his, knowledge, of, hebrew, grammar, and, halakhah, rashi, clarifies, the, simple, meaning, of, the, text, so, that, a, bright, child, of, five, could, understand, it, at, the, same, time, his, commentary, forms, the, foundation, for, some, of, the, most, profound, legal, analysis, and, mystical, discourses, that, came, after, it, scholars, debate, why, rashi, chose, a, particular, midrash, to, illustrate, a, point, or, why, he, used, certain, words, and, phrases, and, not, others, shneur, zalman, of, liadi, wrote, that, rashi, s, commentary, on, torah, is, the, wine, of, torah, it, opens, the, heart, and, uncovers, one, s, essential, love, and, fear, of, g, d, scholars, believe, that, rashi, s, commentary, on, the, torah, grew, out, of, the, lectures, he, gave, to, his, students, in, his, yeshiva, and, evolved, with, the, questions, and, answers, they, raised, on, it, rashi, completed, this, commentary, only, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, it, was, immediately, accepted, as, authoritative, by, all, jewish, communities, ashkenazi, and, sephardi, alike, the, first, dated, hebrew, printed, book, was, rashi, s, commentary, on, the, chumash, printed, by, abraham, ben, garton, in, reggio, di, calabria, italy, 18, february, 1475, this, version, did, not, include, the, text, of, the, chumash, itself, rashi, wrote, commentaries, on, all, the, books, of, tanakh, except, chronicles, i, ii, and, ezra, nehemiah, his, commentary, to, job, is, incomplete, ending, at, 40, 25, a, main, characteristic, of, rashi, s, writing, was, his, focus, on, grammar, and, syntax, his, primary, focus, was, on, word, choice, and, essentially, as, a, dictionary, where, he, defines, unusual, hebrew, words, he, searches, for, things, that, may, not, be, clear, to, the, reader, and, offers, clarification, on, the, inconsistency, that, may, be, present, rashi, does, so, by, filling, in, missing, information, that, lead, to, a, more, complete, understanding, of, the, torah, a, portion, of, his, writing, is, dedicated, to, making, distinctions, between, the, peshat, or, plain, and, literal, meaning, of, the, text, and, the, aggadah, or, rabbinic, interpretation, rashbam, one, of, rashi, s, grandchildren, heavily, critiqued, his, response, on, his, commentary, on, the, torah, based, primarily, on, the, classic, midrashim, rabbinic, homilies, rashi, himself, explained, his, method, as, utilizing, both, peshat, and, derash, i, however, am, only, concerned, with, the, plain, sense, of, scripture, peshuto, shel, mikra, and, with, such, agadoth, that, explain, the, words, of, scripture, in, a, manner, that, fits, in, with, them, in, one, place, he, quotes, a, midrash, and, then, states, but, this, midrash, cannot, be, reconciled, with, scripture, for, several, reasons, therefore, i, say, let, scripture, be, reconciled, according, to, its, simple, meaning, clearly, and, the, midrash, may, also, be, expounded, as, is, said, is, not, my, word, like, a, hammer, which, shatters, the, rock, it, is, divided, into, many, fragments, rashi, wrote, the, first, comprehensive, commentary, on, the, talmud, covering, nearly, all, of, the, babylonian, talmud, a, total, of, 30, out, of, 39, tractates, due, to, his, death, the, commentary, drawing, on, his, knowledge, of, the, entire, contents, of, the, talmud, attempts, to, provide, a, full, explanation, of, the, words, and, of, the, logical, structure, of, each, talmudic, passage, unlike, other, commentators, rashi, does, not, paraphrase, or, exclude, any, part, of, the, text, but, elucidates, phrase, by, phrase, often, he, provides, punctuation, in, the, unpunctuated, text, explaining, for, example, this, is, a, question, he, says, this, in, surprise, he, repeats, this, in, agreement, etc, as, in, his, commentary, on, the, tanakh, rashi, frequently, illustrates, the, meaning, of, the, text, using, analogies, to, the, professions, crafts, and, sports, of, his, day, he, also, translates, difficult, hebrew, or, aramaic, words, into, the, spoken, french, language, of, his, day, giving, latter, day, scholars, a, window, into, the, vocabulary, and, pronunciation, of, old, french, rashi, s, talmud, commentary, spread, quickly, reaching, jews, as, far, as, yemen, by, mid, 12th, century, it, has, been, included, in, every, version, of, the, talmud, since, its, first, printing, in, the, fifteenth, century, it, is, always, situated, towards, the, middle, of, the, opened, book, display, i, e, on, the, side, of, the, page, closest, to, the, binding, some, of, the, other, printed, commentaries, which, are, attributed, to, rashi, were, composed, by, others, primarily, his, students, akiva, eger, stated, that, the, commentary, on, nazir, was, not, in, fact, by, rashi, while, zvi, hirsch, chajes, stated, that, the, commentary, on, taanit, was, not, by, rashi, in, some, editions, of, the, talmud, the, text, indicates, that, rashi, died, before, completing, the, tractate, and, that, it, was, completed, by, a, student, this, is, true, of, makkot, the, end, of, which, was, composed, by, his, son, in, law, judah, ben, nathan, and, of, bava, batra, finished, in, a, more, detailed, style, by, his, grandson, the, rashbam, the, commentary, attributed, to, rashi, on, horayot, was, thought, by, some, to, have, been, written, by, judah, ben, nathan, but, evidence, was, uncovered, indicating, that, the, commentary, on, horayot, was, from, the, school, of, gershom, ben, judah, there, is, a, legend, that, the, commentary, on, nedarim, which, is, clearly, not, his, was, actually, composed, by, his, daughters, another, legend, states, that, rashi, died, while, writing, a, commentary, on, talmud, and, that, the, very, last, word, he, wrote, was, tahor, which, means, pure, in, hebrew, indicating, that, his, soul, was, pure, as, it, left, his, body, about, 300, of, rashi, s, responsa, and, halakhic, decisions, are, extant, although, some, may, find, contradictory, to, rashi, s, intended, purpose, for, his, writings, these, responsa, were, copied, preserved, and, published, by, his, students, grandchildren, and, other, future, scholars, siddur, rashi, compiled, by, an, unknown, student, also, contains, rashi, s, responsa, on, prayer, many, other, rulings, and, responsa, are, recorded, in, mahzor, vitry, other, compilations, include, sefer, hapardes, probably, edited, by, shemaiah, of, troyes, rashi, s, student, and, sefer, haorah, prepared, by, nathan, hamachiri, rashi, s, writing, is, placed, under, the, category, of, post, talmudic, for, its, explanation, and, elaboration, on, the, talmud, however, he, not, only, wrote, about, the, meaning, of, biblical, and, talmudic, passages, but, also, on, liturgical, texts, syntax, rules, and, cases, regarding, new, religions, emerging, some, say, that, his, responsa, allows, people, to, obtain, clear, pictures, of, his, personality, and, shows, rashi, as, a, kind, gentle, humble, and, liberal, man, they, also, illustrate, his, intelligence, and, common, sense, rashi, s, responsa, not, only, addressed, some, of, the, different, cases, and, questions, regarding, jewish, life, and, law, but, it, shed, light, into, the, historical, and, social, conditions, which, the, jews, were, under, during, the, first, crusade, he, covered, the, following, topics, and, themes, in, his, responsa, linguistic, focus, on, texts, law, related, to, prayer, food, and, the, sabbath, wine, produced, by, non, jews, oaths, and, excommunications, sales, partnerships, loans, and, interest, bails, communal, affairs, and, civil, law, rashi, s, responsa, can, be, broken, down, into, three, genres, questions, by, contemporary, sages, and, students, regarding, the, torah, the, law, and, other, compilations, for, example, in, his, writing, regarding, relations, with, the, christians, he, provides, a, guide, for, how, one, should, behave, when, dealing, with, martyrs, and, converts, as, well, as, the, insults, and, terms, of, aimed, at, the, jews, stemming, from, the, aftermath, of, the, crusades, rashi, wrote, concerning, those, who, were, forced, to, convert, and, the, rights, women, had, when, their, husbands, were, killed, rashi, focused, the, majority, of, his, responsa, if, not, all, on, a, meticulous, analysis, of, the, language, of, the, text, rashi, wrote, several, selichot, penitential, prayers, some, of, which, are, still, recited, today, as, part, of, the, jewish, liturgy, these, include, other, poems, are, sometimes, falsely, attributed, to, rashi, the, above, list, is, probably, not, exhaustive, but, no, evidence, exists, to, connect, rashi, to, other, poems, rashi, was, one, of, the, first, authors, to, write, in, old, french, the, language, he, spoke, in, everyday, life, which, he, used, alongside, hebrew, as, most, contemporary, french, authors, instead, wrote, in, latin, as, a, consequence, besides, its, religious, value, his, work, is, valued, for, the, insight, it, gives, into, the, language, and, culture, of, northern, france, in, the, 11th, century, his, commentaries, on, the, tanakh, especially, his, commentary, on, the, chumash, the, five, books, of, moses, serves, as, the, basis, of, more, than, 300, supercommentaries, which, analyze, rashi, s, choice, of, language, and, citations, penned, by, some, of, the, greatest, names, in, rabbinic, literature, tens, of, thousands, of, men, women, and, children, study, chumash, with, rashi, as, they, review, the, torah, portion, to, be, read, in, synagogue, on, the, upcoming, shabbat, according, to, halakha, a, man, may, even, fulfill, of, the, requirement, of, shnayim, mikra, ve, echad, targum, by, reading, rashi, s, commentary, rather, than, the, standard, targum, onkelos, since, its, publication, rashi, s, commentary, on, the, torah, is, standard, in, almost, all, chumashim, produced, within, the, orthodox, jewish, community, mordechai, leifer, of, nadvorna, said, that, anyone, who, learns, the, weekly, parsha, together, with, the, commentary, by, rashi, every, week, is, guaranteed, to, sit, in, the, yeshiva, school, of, rashi, in, the, afterlife, voluminous, supercommentaries, have, been, published, on, rashi, s, bible, commentaries, including, gur, aryeh, by, judah, loew, the, maharal, sefer, ha, mizrachi, by, elijah, mizrachi, the, re, em, and, yeri, ot, shlomo, by, solomon, luria, the, maharshal, menachem, mendel, schneerson, in, his, rashi, sichos, often, addresses, several, of, these, commentaries, at, once, rashi, s, influence, grew, the, most, in, the, 15th, century, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, his, commentaries, were, translated, into, many, other, languages, rashi, s, commentary, on, the, pentateuch, was, known, as, the, first, printed, hebrew, work, english, translations, include, those, of, rosenbaum, and, silbermann, and, artscroll, rashi, s, commentary, on, the, talmud, continues, to, be, a, key, basis, for, contemporary, rabbinic, scholarship, and, interpretation, without, rashi, s, commentary, the, talmud, would, have, remained, a, closed, book, rashi, s, commentary, had, a, profound, influence, on, subsequent, talmud, study, and, scholarship, the, commentaries, of, rashi, democratized, talmudic, scholarship, prior, to, his, work, the, only, way, to, master, a, tractate, was, to, travel, to, a, talmudic, academy, and, study, at, the, feet, of, a, master, no, written, work, could, systematically, convey, with, any, degree, of, sustained, accuracy, the, precise, line, of, a, talmudic, argument, with, the, appearance, of, rashi, s, work, anyone, regardless, of, means, could, by, dint, of, talent, and, effort, master, any, talmudic, topic, it, further, expanded, the, range, of, knowledge, of, most, scholars, previously, one, knew, accurately, only, what, one, had, been, fortunate, to, study, at, an, academy, the, lifelong, study, of, talmud, the, constant, conquest, of, new, tractates, and, the, unlimited, personal, acquisition, of, knowledge, was, in, many, ways, the, consequence, of, rashi, s, inimitable, work, of, exposition, the, presence, of, rashi, s, commentary, also, changed, the, nature, of, subsequent, talmud, commentaries, this, is, not, to, say, that, rashi, s, explanations, were, definitive, far, from, it, for, some, three, hundred, years, scholars, scrutinized, his, commentary, criticized, innumerable, passages, and, demanded, their, reinterpretation, yet, all, realized, that, the, problem, that, had, confronted, scholars, for, close, to, half, a, millennium, how, to, turn, the, abrupt, and, sometimes, gnomic, formulations, of, the, talmud, into, a, coherent, and, smoothly, flowing, text, had, been, solved, definitively, by, rashi, the, subsequent, task, of, scholars, therefore, was, to, emend, and, add, to, his, interpretations, in, general, rashi, s, commentary, provides, the, peshat, or, literal, meaning, of, the, talmud,
