been, in, publication, for, less, than, four, years, when, he, died, of, tuberculosis, at, the, age, of, 25, they, were, indifferently, received, in, his, lifetime, but, his, fame, grew, rapidly, after, his, death, by, the, end, of, the, century, he, was, placed, in, the, canon, of, english, literature, strongly, influencing, many, writers, of, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, of, 1888, called, one, ode, one, of, the, final, masterpieces, keats, had, a, style, heavily, loaded, with, sensualities, notably, in, the, series, of, odes, typically, of, the, romantics, he, accentuated, extreme, emotion, through, natural, imagery, today, his, poems, and, letters, remain, among, the, most, popular, and, analysed, in, english, literature, in, particular, ode, to, a, nightingale, ode, on, a, grecian, urn, sleep, and, poetry, and, the, sonnet, on, first, looking, into, chapman, s, homer, jorge, luis, borges, named, his, first, time, reading, keats, an, experience, he, felt, all, his, life, john, keats, was, born, in, moorgate, london, on, 31, october, 1795, to, thomas, and, frances, keats, n, e, jennings, there, is, little, evidence, of, his, exact, birthplace, although, keats, and, his, family, seem, to, have, marked, his, birthday, on, 29, october, baptism, records, give, the, date, as, the, 31st, he, was, the, eldest, of, four, surviving, children, his, younger, siblings, were, george, 1797, 1841, thomas, 1799, 1818, and, frances, mary, fanny, 1803, 1889, who, later, married, the, spanish, author, valent, n, llanos, guti, rrez, another, son, was, lost, in, infancy, his, father, first, worked, as, an, ostler, at, the, stables, attached, to, the, swan, and, hoop, inn, owned, by, his, father, in, law, john, jennings, an, establishment, he, later, managed, and, where, the, growing, family, lived, for, some, years, keats, believed, he, was, born, at, the, inn, a, birthplace, of, humble, origins, but, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, this, the, globe, pub, now, occupies, the, site, a, few, yards, from, modern, moorgate, station, keats, was, baptised, at, st, botolph, without, bishopsgate, and, sent, to, a, local, dame, school, as, a, child, his, parents, wished, to, send, their, sons, to, eton, or, harrow, but, the, family, decided, they, could, not, afford, the, fees, in, the, summer, of, 1803, john, was, sent, to, board, at, john, clarke, s, school, in, enfield, close, to, his, grandparents, house, the, small, school, had, a, liberal, outlook, and, a, progressive, curriculum, more, modern, than, the, larger, more, prestigious, schools, in, the, family, atmosphere, at, clarke, s, keats, developed, an, interest, in, classics, and, history, which, would, stay, with, him, throughout, his, short, life, the, headmaster, s, son, charles, cowden, clarke, also, became, an, important, mentor, and, friend, introducing, keats, to, renaissance, literature, including, tasso, spenser, and, chapman, s, translations, the, young, keats, was, described, by, his, friend, edward, holmes, as, a, volatile, character, always, in, extremes, given, to, indolence, and, fighting, at, 13, he, began, focusing, his, energy, on, reading, and, study, winning, his, first, academic, prize, in, midsummer, 1809, in, april, 1804, when, keats, was, eight, his, father, died, from, a, skull, fracture, after, falling, from, his, horse, while, returning, from, a, visit, to, keats, and, his, brother, george, at, school, thomas, keats, died, intestate, frances, remarried, two, months, later, but, left, her, new, husband, soon, afterwards, and, the, four, children, went, to, live, with, a, grandmother, alice, jennings, in, the, village, of, edmonton, in, march, 1810, when, keats, was, 14, his, mother, died, of, tuberculosis, leaving, the, children, in, their, grandmother, s, custody, she, appointed, two, guardians, richard, abbey, and, john, sandell, for, them, that, autumn, keats, left, clarke, s, school, to, be, an, apprentice, with, thomas, hammond, a, surgeon, and, apothecary, who, was, a, neighbour, and, the, doctor, of, the, jennings, family, keats, lodged, in, the, attic, above, the, surgery, at, 7, church, street, until, 1813, cowden, clarke, who, remained, close, to, keats, called, this, period, the, most, placid, time, in, keats, life, from, 1814, keats, had, two, bequests, held, in, trust, for, him, until, his, 21st, birthday, 800, was, willed, by, his, grandfather, john, jennings, also, keats, s, mother, left, a, legacy, of, 8000, to, be, equally, divided, among, her, living, children, it, seems, he, was, not, told, of, the, 800, and, probably, knew, nothing, of, it, as, he, never, applied, for, it, historically, blame, has, often, been, laid, on, abbey, as, legal, guardian, but, he, may, also, have, been, unaware, of, it, william, walton, solicitor, for, keats, s, mother, and, grandmother, definitely, knew, and, had, a, duty, of, care, to, relay, the, information, to, keats, it, seems, he, did, not, though, it, would, have, made, a, critical, difference, to, the, poet, s, expectations, money, was, always, a, great, concern, and, difficulty, as, he, struggled, to, stay, out, of, debt, and, make, his, way, in, the, world, independently, on, first, looking, into, chapman, s, homer, much, have, i, travell, d, in, the, realms, of, gold, and, many, goodly, states, and, kingdoms, seen, round, many, western, islands, have, i, been, which, bards, in, fealty, to, apollo, hold, oft, of, one, wide, expanse, had, i, been, told, that, deep, browed, homer, ruled, as, his, demesne, yet, did, i, never, breathe, its, pure, serene, till, i, heard, chapman, speak, out, loud, and, bold, then, felt, i, like, some, watcher, of, the, skies, when, a, new, planet, swims, into, his, ken, or, like, stout, cortez, when, with, eagle, eyes, he, star, d, at, the, pacific, and, all, his, men, look, d, at, each, other, with, a, wild, surmise, silent, upon, a, peak, in, darien, the, sonnet, on, first, looking, into, chapman, s, homer, october, 1816, in, october, 1815, having, finished, his, five, year, apprenticeship, with, hammond, keats, registered, as, a, medical, student, at, guy, s, hospital, now, part, of, king, s, college, london, and, began, studying, there, within, a, month, he, was, accepted, as, a, dresser, at, the, hospital, assisting, surgeons, during, operations, the, equivalent, of, a, junior, house, surgeon, today, it, was, a, significant, promotion, that, marked, a, distinct, aptitude, for, medicine, and, it, brought, greater, responsibility, and, a, heavier, workload, keats, s, long, and, expensive, medical, training, with, hammond, and, at, guy, s, hospital, led, his, family, to, assume, he, would, pursue, a, lifelong, career, in, medicine, assuring, financial, security, and, it, seems, that, at, this, point, keats, had, a, genuine, desire, to, become, a, doctor, he, lodged, near, the, hospital, at, 28, st, thomas, s, street, in, southwark, with, other, medical, students, including, henry, stephens, who, gained, fame, as, an, inventor, and, ink, magnate, keats, s, training, took, up, increasing, amounts, of, his, writing, time, and, he, became, increasingly, ambivalent, about, it, he, felt, he, was, facing, a, stark, choice, he, had, written, his, first, extant, poem, an, imitation, of, spenser, in, 1814, when, he, was, 19, now, strongly, drawn, by, ambition, inspired, by, fellow, poets, such, as, leigh, hunt, and, lord, byron, and, beleaguered, by, family, financial, crises, he, suffered, periods, of, depression, his, brother, george, wrote, that, john, feared, that, he, should, never, be, a, poet, if, he, was, not, he, would, destroy, himself, in, 1816, keats, received, his, apothecary, s, licence, which, made, him, eligible, to, practise, as, an, apothecary, physician, and, surgeon, but, before, the, end, of, the, year, he, informed, his, guardian, that, he, resolved, to, be, a, poet, not, a, surgeon, although, he, continued, his, work, and, training, at, guy, s, keats, devoted, more, and, more, time, to, the, study, of, literature, experimenting, with, verse, forms, particularly, the, sonnet, in, may, 1816, leigh, hunt, agreed, to, publish, the, sonnet, o, solitude, in, his, magazine, the, examiner, a, leading, liberal, magazine, of, the, day, this, was, the, first, appearance, of, keats, s, poetry, in, print, charles, cowden, clarke, called, it, his, friend, s, red, letter, day, first, proof, that, keats, ambitions, were, valid, among, his, poems, of, 1816, was, to, my, brothers, that, summer, keats, went, with, clarke, to, the, seaside, town, of, margate, to, write, there, he, began, calidore, and, initiated, an, era, of, great, letter, writing, on, returning, to, london, he, took, lodgings, at, 8, dean, street, southwark, and, braced, himself, to, study, further, for, membership, of, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, in, october, 1816, clarke, introduced, keats, to, the, influential, leigh, hunt, a, close, friend, of, byron, and, shelley, five, months, later, came, the, publication, of, poems, the, first, volume, of, keats, s, verse, which, included, i, stood, tiptoe, and, sleep, and, poetry, both, strongly, influenced, by, hunt, the, book, was, a, critical, failure, arousing, little, interest, although, reynolds, reviewed, it, favourably, in, the, champion, clarke, commented, that, the, book, might, have, emerged, in, timbuctoo, keats, s, publishers, charles, and, james, ollier, felt, ashamed, of, it, keats, immediately, changed, publishers, to, taylor, and, hessey, in, fleet, street, unlike, the, olliers, keats, s, new, publishers, were, enthusiastic, about, his, work, within, a, month, of, the, publication, of, poems, they, were, planning, a, new, keats, volume, and, had, paid, him, an, advance, hessey, became, a, steady, friend, to, keats, and, made, the, company, s, rooms, available, for, young, writers, to, meet, their, publishing, lists, came, to, include, coleridge, hazlitt, clare, hogg, carlyle, and, charles, lamb, through, taylor, and, hessey, keats, met, their, eton, educated, lawyer, richard, woodhouse, who, advised, them, on, literary, as, well, as, legal, matters, and, was, deeply, impressed, by, poems, although, he, noted, that, keats, could, be, wayward, trembling, easily, daunted, woodhouse, was, convinced, of, keats, s, genius, a, poet, to, support, as, he, became, one, of, england, s, greatest, writers, soon, after, they, met, the, two, became, close, friends, and, woodhouse, started, to, collect, keatsiana, documenting, as, much, as, he, could, about, the, poetry, this, archive, survives, as, one, of, the, main, sources, of, information, on, keats, s, work, andrew, motion, represents, him, as, boswell, to, keats, s, johnson, ceaselessly, promoting, his, work, fighting, his, corner, and, spurring, his, poetry, to, greater, heights, in, later, years, woodhouse, was, one, of, the, few, to, accompany, keats, to, gravesend, kent, to, embark, on, his, final, trip, to, rome, despite, the, bad, reviews, of, poems, hunt, published, the, essay, three, young, poets, shelley, keats, and, reynolds, and, the, sonnet, on, first, looking, into, chapman, s, homer, foreseeing, great, things, to, come, he, introduced, keats, to, many, prominent, men, in, his, circle, including, the, editor, of, the, times, thomas, barnes, the, writer, charles, lamb, the, conductor, vincent, novello, and, the, poet, john, hamilton, reynolds, who, would, become, a, close, friend, keats, also, met, regularly, with, william, hazlitt, a, powerful, literary, figure, of, the, day, it, was, a, turning, point, for, keats, establishing, him, in, the, public, eye, as, a, figure, in, what, hunt, termed, a, new, school, of, poetry, at, this, time, keats, wrote, to, his, friend, bailey, i, am, certain, of, nothing, but, the, holiness, of, the, heart, s, affections, and, the, truth, of, the, imagination, what, imagination, seizes, as, beauty, must, be, truth, this, passage, would, eventually, be, transmuted, into, the, concluding, lines, of, ode, on, a, grecian, urn, beauty, is, truth, truth, beauty, that, is, all, ye, know, on, earth, and, all, ye, need, to, know, in, early, december, 1816, under, the, heady, influence, of, his, artistic, friends, keats, told, abbey, he, had, decided, to, give, up, medicine, in, favour, of, poetry, to, abbey, s, fury, keats, had, spent, a, great, deal, on, his, medical, training, and, despite, his, state, of, financial, hardship, and, indebtedness, made, large, loans, to, friends, such, as, the, painter, benjamin, haydon, keats, would, go, on, to, lend, 700, to, his, brother, george, by, lending, so, much, keats, could, no, longer, cover, the, interest, of, his, own, debts, having, left, his, training, at, the, hospital, suffering, from, a, succession, of, colds, and, unhappy, with, living, in, damp, rooms, in, london, keats, moved, with, his, brothers, into, rooms, at, 1, well, walk, in, the, village, of, hampstead, in, april, 1817, there, john, and, george, nursed, their, tubercular, brother, tom, the, house, was, close, to, hunt, and, others, of, his, circle, in, hampstead, and, to, coleridge, respected, elder, of, the, first, wave, of, romantic, poets, then, living, in, highgate, on, 11, april, 1818, keats, reported, that, he, and, coleridge, had, taken, a, long, walk, on, hampstead, heath, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, george, he, wrote, that, they, had, talked, about, a, thousand, things, nightingales, poetry, poetical, sensation, metaphysics, around, this, time, he, was, introduced, to, charles, wentworth, dilke, and, james, rice, in, june, 1818, keats, began, a, walking, tour, of, scotland, ireland, and, the, lake, district, with, charles, armitage, brown, keats, s, brother, george, and, his, wife, georgiana, accompanied, them, to, lancaster, and, then, continued, to, liverpool, from, where, they, migrated, to, america, living, in, ohio, and, louisville, kentucky, until, 1841, when, george, s, investments, failed, like, keats, s, other, brother, they, both, died, penniless, and, racked, by, tuberculosis, for, which, there, was, no, effective, treatment, until, the, next, century, in, july, while, on, the, isle, of, mull, keats, caught, a, bad, cold, and, was, too, thin, and, fevered, to, proceed, on, the, journey, after, returning, south, in, august, keats, continued, to, nurse, tom, so, exposing, himself, to, infection, some, have, suggested, this, was, when, tuberculosis, his, family, disease, took, hold, consumption, was, not, identified, as, a, disease, with, a, single, infectious, origin, until, 1820, there, was, considerable, stigma, attached, to, it, as, it, was, often, tied, with, weakness, repressed, sexual, passion, or, masturbation, keats, refuses, to, give, it, a, name, in, his, letters, tom, keats, died, on, 1, december, 1818, john, keats, moved, to, the, newly, built, wentworth, place, owned, by, his, friend, charles, armitage, brown, it, was, on, the, edge, of, hampstead, heath, ten, minutes, walk, south, of, his, old, home, in, well, walk, the, winter, of, 1818, 19, though, a, difficult, period, for, the, poet, marked, the, beginning, of, his, annus, mirabilis, in, which, he, wrote, his, most, mature, work, he, had, been, inspired, by, a, series, of, recent, lectures, by, hazlitt, on, english, poets, and, poetic, identity, and, had, also, met, wordsworth, keats, may, have, seemed, to, his, friends, to, be, living, on, comfortable, means, but, in, reality, he, was, borrowing, regularly, from, abbey, and, his, friends, he, composed, five, of, his, six, great, odes, at, wentworth, place, in, april, and, may, and, although, it, is, debated, in, which, order, they, were, written, ode, to, psyche, opened, the, published, series, according, to, brown, ode, to, a, nightingale, was, composed, under, a, plum, tree, in, the, garden, brown, wrote, in, the, spring, of, 1819, a, nightingale, had, built, her, nest, near, my, house, keats, felt, a, tranquil, and, continual, joy, in, her, song, and, one, morning, he, took, his, chair, from, the, breakfast, table, to, the, grass, plot, under, a, plum, tree, where, he, sat, for, two, or, three, hours, when, he, came, into, the, house, i, perceived, he, had, some, scraps, of, paper, in, his, hand, and, these, he, was, quietly, thrusting, behind, the, books, on, inquiry, i, found, those, scraps, four, or, five, in, number, contained, his, poetic, feelings, on, the, song, of, our, nightingale, dilke, co, owner, of, the, house, strenuously, denied, the, story, printed, in, richard, monckton, milnes, 1848, biography, of, keats, dismissing, it, as, pure, delusion, my, heart, aches, and, a, drowsy, numbness, pains, my, sense, as, though, of, hemlock, i, had, drunk, or, emptied, some, dull, opiate, to, the, drains, one, minute, past, and, lethe, wards, had, sunk, tis, not, through, envy, of, thy, happy, lot, but, being, too, happy, in, thine, happiness, that, thou, light, winged, dryad, of, the, trees, in, some, melodious, plot, of, beechen, green, and, shadows, numberless, singest, of, summer, in, full, throated, ease, first, stanza, of, ode, to, a, nightingale, may, 1819, ode, on, a, grecian, urn, and, ode, on, melancholy, were, inspired, by, sonnet, forms, and, probably, written, after, ode, to, a, nightingale, keats, s, new, and, progressive, publishers, taylor, and, hessey, issued, endymion, which, keats, dedicated, to, thomas, chatterton, a, work, that, he, termed, a, trial, of, my, powers, of, imagination, it, was, damned, by, the, critics, giving, rise, to, byron, s, quip, that, keats, was, ultimately, snuffed, out, by, an, article, suggesting, that, he, never, truly, got, over, it, a, particularly, harsh, review, by, john, wilson, croker, appeared, in, the, april, 1818, edition, of, the, quarterly, review, john, gibson, lockhart, writing, in, blackwood, s, magazine, described, endymion, as, imperturbable, drivelling, idiocy, with, biting, sarcasm, lockhart, advised, it, is, a, better, and, a, wiser, thing, to, be, a, starved, apothecary, than, a, starved, poet, so, back, to, the, shop, mr, john, back, to, plasters, pills, and, ointment, boxes, it, was, lockhart, at, blackwoods, who, coined, the, defamatory, term, the, cockney, school, for, hunt, and, his, circle, which, included, both, hazlitt, and, keats, the, dismissal, was, as, much, political, as, literary, aimed, at, upstart, young, writers, deemed, uncouth, for, their, lack, of, education, non, formal, rhyming, and, low, diction, they, had, not, attended, eton, harrow, or, oxbridge, and, they, were, not, from, the, upper, classes, in, 1819, keats, wrote, the, eve, of, st, agnes, la, belle, dame, sans, merci, hyperion, lamia, and, a, play, otho, the, great, critically, damned, and, not, performed, until, 1950, the, poems, fancy, and, bards, of, passion, and, of, mirth, were, inspired, by, the, garden, of, wentworth, place, in, september, very, short, of, money, and, in, despair, considering, taking, up, journalism, or, a, post, as, a, ship, s, surgeon, he, approached, his, publishers, with, a, new, book, of, poems, they, were, unimpressed, with, the, collection, finding, the, presented, versions, of, lamia, confusing, and, describing, st, agnes, as, having, a, sense, of, pettish, disgust, and, a, don, juan, style, of, mingling, up, sentiment, and, sneering, concluding, it, was, a, poem, unfit, for, ladies, the, final, volume, keats, lived, to, see, published, lamia, isabella, the, eve, of, st, agnes, and, other, poems, was, published, in, july, 1820, it, received, greater, acclaim, than, had, endymion, or, poems, finding, favourable, notices, in, both, the, examiner, and, edinburgh, review, it, came, to, be, recognised, as, one, of, the, most, important, poetic, works, ever, published, wentworth, place, now, houses, the, keats, house, museum, keats, befriended, isabella, jones, in, may, 1817, while, on, holiday, in, the, village, of, bo, peep, near, hastings, she, is, described, as, beautiful, talented, and, widely, read, not, of, the, top, flight, of, society, yet, financially, secure, an, enigmatic, figure, who, would, become, a, part, of, keats, s, circle, throughout, their, friendship, keats, never, hesitated, to, own, his, sexual, attraction, to, her, although, they, seemed, to, enjoy, circling, each, other, rather, than, offering, commitment, he, writes, that, he, frequented, her, rooms, in, the, winter, of, 1818, 19, and, in, his, letters, to, george, says, that, he, warmed, with, her, and, kissed, her, the, trysts, may, have, been, a, sexual, initiation, for, keats, according, to, bate, and, robert, gittings, jones, inspired, and, was, a, steward, of, keats, s, writing, the, themes, of, the, eve, of, st, agnes, and, the, eve, of, st, mark, may, well, have, been, suggested, by, her, the, lyric, hush, hush, was, about, her, and, that, the, first, version, of, bright, star, may, have, originally, been, for, her, in, 1821, jones, was, one, of, the, first, in, england, to, be, notified, of, keats, s, death, letters, and, drafts, of, poems, suggest, that, keats, first, met, frances, fanny, brawne, between, september, and, november, 1818, it, is, likely, that, the, 18, year, old, brawne, visited, the, dilke, family, at, wentworth, place, before, she, lived, there, she, was, born, in, the, hamlet, of, west, end, now, in, the, district, of, west, hampstead, on, 9, august, 1800, like, keats, s, grandfather, her, grandfather, kept, a, london, inn, and, both, lost, several, family, members, to, tuberculosis, she, shared, her, first, name, with, both, keats, s, sister, and, mother, and, had, a, talent, for, dress, making, and, languages, as, well, as, a, natural, theatrical, bent, during, november, 1818, she, developed, an, intimacy, with, keats, but, it, was, shadowed, by, the, illness, of, tom, keats, whom, john, was, nursing, through, this, period, on, 3, april, 1819, brawne, and, her, widowed, mother, moved, into, the, other, half, of, dilke, s, wentworth, place, and, keats, and, brawne, were, able, to, see, each, other, every, day, keats, began, to, lend, brawne, books, such, as, dante, s, inferno, and, they, would, read, together, he, gave, her, the, love, sonnet, bright, star, perhaps, revised, for, her, as, a, declaration, it, was, a, work, in, progress, which, he, continued, until, the, last, months, of, his, life, and, the, poem, came, to, be, associated, with, their, relationship, all, his, desires, were, concentrated, on, fanny, from, this, point, there, is, no, further, documented, mention, of, isabella, jones, sometime, before, the, end, of, june, he, arrived, at, some, sort, of, understanding, with, brawne, far, from, a, formal, engagement, as, he, still, had, too, little, to, offer, with, no, prospects, and, financial, stricture, keats, endured, great, conflict, knowing, his, expectations, as, a, struggling, poet, in, increasingly, hard, straits, would, preclude, marriage, to, brawne, their, love, remained, unconsummated, jealousy, for, his, star, began, to, gnaw, at, him, darkness, disease, and, depression, surrounded, him, reflected, in, poems, such, as, the, eve, of, st, agnes, and, la, belle, dame, sans, merci, were, love, and, death, both, stalk, i, have, two, luxuries, to, brood, over, in, my, walks, he, wrote, to, her, your, loveliness, and, the, hour, of, my, death, in, one, of, his, many, hundreds, of, notes, and, letters, keats, wrote, to, brawne, on, 13, october, 1819, my, love, has, made, me, selfish, i, cannot, exist, without,

advised, by, his, doctors, to, move, to, a, warmer, climate, in, september, 1820, keats, left, for, rome, knowing, he, would, probably, never, see, brawne, again, after, leaving, he, felt, unable, to, write, to, her, or, read, her, letters, although, he, did, correspond, with, her, mother, he, died, there, five, months, later, none, of, brawne, s, letters, to, keats, survive, it, took, a, month, for, the, news, of, his, death, to, reach, london, after, which, brawne, stayed, in, mourning, for, six, years, in, 1833, more, than, 12, years, after, his, death, she, married, and, went, on, to, have, three, children, she, outlived, keats, by, more, than, 40, years, during, 1820, keats, displayed, increasingly, serious, symptoms, of, tuberculosis, suffering, two, lung, haemorrhages, in, the, first, few, days, of, february, on, first, coughing, up, blood, on, 3, february, 1820, he, said, to, charles, armitage, brown, i, know, the, colour, of, that, blood, it, is, arterial, blood, i, cannot, be, deceived, in, that, colour, that, drop, of, blood, is, my, death, warrant, i, must, die, he, lost, large, amounts, of, blood, and, was, bled, further, by, the, attending, physician, hunt, nursed, him, in, london, for, much, of, the, following, summer, at, the, suggestion, of, his, doctors, he, agreed, to, move, to, italy, with, his, friend, joseph, severn, on, 13, september, they, left, for, gravesend, and, four, days, later, boarded, the, sailing, brig, maria, crowther, on, 1, october, the, ship, landed, at, lulworth, bay, or, holworth, bay, where, the, two, went, ashore, back, on, board, ship, he, made, the, final, revisions, of, bright, star, the, journey, was, a, minor, catastrophe, storms, broke, out, followed, by, a, dead, calm, that, slowed, the, ship, s,

november, by, which, time, any, hope, of, the, warmer, climate, he, sought, had, disappeared, keats, wrote, his, last, letter, on, 30, november, 1820, to, charles, armitage, brown, tis, the, most, difficult, thing, in, the, world, to, me, to, write, a, letter, my, stomach, continues, so, bad, that, i, feel, it, worse, on, opening, any, book, yet, i, am, much, better, than, i, was, in,

care, from, severn, and, dr, james, clark, his, health, rapidly, deteriorated, the, medical, attention, keats, received, may, have, hastened, his, death, in, november, 1820, clark, declared, that, the, source, of, his, illness, was, mental, exertion, and, that, the, source, was, largely, situated, in, his, stomach, clark, eventually, diagnosed, consumption, tuberculosis, and, placed, keats, on, a, starvation, diet, of, an, anchovy, and, a, piece, of, bread, a, day, intended, to, reduce, the, blood, flow, to, his, stomach, he, also, bled, the, poet, a, standard, treatment, of, the, day, but, also, likely, a, significant, contributor, to, keats, s, weakness, severn, s, biographer, sue, brown, writes, they, could, have, used, opium, in, small, doses, and, keats, had, asked, severn, to, buy, a, bottle, of, opium, when, they, were, setting, off, on, their, voyage, what, severn, didn, t, realise, was, that, keats, saw, it, as, a, possible, resource, if, he, wanted, to, commit, suicide, he, tried, to, get, the, bottle, from, severn, on, the, voyage, but, severn, wouldn, t, let, him, have, it, then, in, rome, he, tried, again, severn, was, in, such, a, quandary, he, didn, t, know, what, to, do, so, in, the, end, he, went, to, the, doctor, who, took, it, away, as, a, result, keats, went, through, dreadful, agonies, with, nothing, to, ease, the, pain, at, all, keats, was, angry, with, both, severn, and, clark, when, they, would, not, give, him, laudanum, opium, he, repeatedly, demanded, how, long, is, this, posthumous, existence, of, mine, to, go, on, the, first, months, of, 1821, marked, a, slow, and, steady, decline, into, the, final, stage, of, tuberculosis, his, autopsy, showed, his, lung, almost, disintegrated, keats, was, coughing, up, blood, and, covered, in, sweat, severn, nursed, him, devotedly, and, observed, in, a, letter, how, keats, would, sometimes, cry, upon, waking, to, find, himself, still, alive, severn, writes, keats, raves, till, i, am, in, a, complete, tremble, for, him, about, four, the, approaches, of, death, came, on, severn, i, lift, me, up, i, am, dying, i, shall, die, easy, don, t, be, frightened, be, firm, and, thank, god, it, has, come, i, lifted, him, up, in, my, arms, the, phlegm, seem, d, boiling, in, his, throat, and, increased, until, eleven, when, he, gradually, sank, into, death, so, quiet, that, i, still, thought, he, slept, john, keats, died, in, rome, on, 23, february, 1821, his, body, was, buried, in, the, city, s, protestant, cemetery, his, last, request, was, to, be, placed, under, a, tombstone, bearing, no, name, or, date, only, the, words, here, lies, one, whose, name, was, writ, in, water, severn, and, brown, erected, the, stone, which, under, a, relief, of, a, lyre, with, broken, strings, includes, the, epitaph, this, grave, contains, all, that, was, mortal, of, a, young, english, poet, who, on, his, death, bed, in, the, bitterness, of, his, heart, at, the, malicious, power, of, his, enemies, desired, these, words, to, be, engraven, on, his, tomb, stone, here, lies, one, whose, name, was, writ, in, water, feb, 24th, 1821, severn, and, brown, added, their, lines, to, the, stone, in, protest, at, the, critical, reception, of, keats, s, work, hunt, blamed, his, death, on, the, quarterly, review, s, scathing, attack, of, endymion, as, byron, quipped, in, his, narrative, poem, don,

now, umbrella, pines, myrtle, shrubs, roses, and, carpets, of, wild, violets, when, keats, died, at, 25, he, had, been, writing, poetry, seriously, for, only, about, six, years, from, 1814, until, the, summer, of, 1820, and, publishing, for, only, four, in, his, lifetime, sales, of, keats, s, three, volumes, of, poetry, probably, amounted, to, only, 200, copies, his, first, poem, the, sonnet, o, solitude, appeared, in, the, examiner, in, may, 1816, while, his, collection, lamia, isabella, the, eve, of, st, agnes, and, other, poems, was, published, in, july, 1820, before, his, last, visit, to, rome, the, compression, of, his, poetic, apprenticeship, and, maturity, into, so, short, a, time, is, just, one, remarkable, aspect, of, keats, s, work, although, prolific, during, his, short, career, and, now, one, of, the, most, studied, and, admired, british, poets, his, reputation, rests, on, a, small, body, of, work, centred, on, the, odes, and, only, in, the, creative, outpouring, of, the, last, years, of, his, short, life, was, he, able, to, express, the, inner, intensity, for, which, he, has, been, lauded, since, his, death, keats, was, convinced, that, he, had, made, no, mark, in, his, lifetime, aware, that, he, was, dying, he, wrote, to, fanny, brawne, in, february, 1820, i, have, left, no, immortal, work, behind, me, nothing, to, make, my, friends, proud, of, my, memory, but, i, have, lov, d, the, principle, of, beauty, in, all, things, and, if, i, had, had, time, i, would, have, made, myself, remember, d, keats, s, ability, and, talent, was, acknowledged, by, several, influential, contemporary, allies, such, as, shelley, and, hunt, his, admirers, praised, him, for, thinking, on, his, pulses, for, having, developed, a, style, which, was, more, heavily, loaded, with, sensualities, more, gorgeous, in, its, effects, more, voluptuously, alive, than, any, poet, who, had, come, before, him, loading, every, rift, with, ore, shelley, often, corresponded, with, keats, in, rome, and, loudly, declared, that, keats, s, death, had, been, brought, on, by, bad, reviews, in, the, quarterly, review, seven, weeks, after, the, funeral, he, wrote, adonais, a, despairing, elegy, stating, that, keats, s, early, death, was, a, personal, and, public, tragedy, the, loveliest, and, the, last, the, bloom, whose, petals, nipped, before, they, blew, died, on, the, promise, of, the, fruit, although, keats, wrote, that, if, poetry, comes, not, as, naturally, as, the, leaves, to, a, tree, it, had, better, not, come, at, all, poetry, did, not, come, easily, to, him, his, work, was, the, fruit, of, a, deliberate, and, prolonged, classical, self, education, he, may, have, possessed, an, innate, poetic, sensibility, but, his, early, works, were, clearly, those, of, a, young, man, learning, his, craft, his, first, attempts, at, verse, were, often, vague, languorously, narcotic, and, lacking, a, clear, eye, his, poetic, sense, was, based, on, the, conventional, tastes, of, his, friend, charles, cowden, clarke, who, first, introduced, him, to, the, classics, and, also, came, from, the, predilections, of, hunt, s, examiner, which, keats, read, as, a, boy, hunt, scorned, the, augustan, or, french, school, dominated, by, pope, and, attacked, earlier, romantic, poets, wordsworth, and, coleridge, now, in, their, forties, as, unsophisticated, obscure, and, crude, writers, during, keats, s, few, years, as, a, published, poet, the, reputation, of, the, older, romantic, school, was, at, its, lowest, ebb, keats, came, to, echo, these, sentiments, in, his, work, identifying, himself, with, a, new, school, for, a, time, somewhat, alienating, him, from, wordsworth, coleridge, and, byron, and, providing, a, basis, for, scathing, attacks, from, blackwood, s, and, the, quarterly, review, season, of, mists, and, mellow, fruitfulness, close, bosom, friend, of, the, maturing, sun, conspiring, with, him, how, to, load, and, bless,

obscurity, of, first, wave, romantics, and, uneducated, affectation, of, hunt, s, cockney, school, keats, s, posthumous, reputation, mixed, the, reviewers, caricature, of, the, simplistic, bumbler, with, the, image, of, a, hyper, sensitive, genius, killed, by, high, feeling, which, shelley, later, portrayed, the, victorian, sense, of, poetry, as, the, work, of, indulgence, and, luxuriant, fancy, offered, a, schema, into, which, keats, was, posthumously, fitted, marked, as, the, standard, bearer, of, sensory, writing, his, reputation, grew, steadily, and, remarkably, his, work, had, the, full, support, of, the, influential, cambridge, apostles, whose, members, included, the, young, tennyson, later, a, popular, poet, laureate, who, came, to, regard, keats, as, the, greatest, poet, of, the,

distracted, by, metaphysics, or, politics, fashions, or, science, eliot, wrote, of, keats, s, conclusions, there, is, hardly, one, statement, of, keats, about, poetry, which, will, not, be, found, to, be, true, and, what, is, more, true, for, greater, and, more, mature, poetry, than, anything, keats, ever, wrote, few, of, keats, s, letters, remain, from, the, period, before, he, joined, his, literary, circle, from, spring, 1817, however, there, is, a, rich, record, of, his, prolific, and, impressive, letter, writing, skills, he, and, his, friends, poets, critics, novelists, and, editors, wrote, to, each, other, daily, and, keats, s, ideas, are, bound, up, in, the, ordinary, his, day, to, day, missives, sharing, news, parody, and, social, commentary, they, glitter, with, humour, and, critical, intelligence, born, of, an, unself, conscious, stream, of, consciousness, they, are, impulsive, full, of, awareness, of, his, own, nature, and, his, weak, spots, when, his, brother, george, went, to, america, keats, wrote, to, him, in, detail, the, body, of, letters, becoming, the, real, diary, and, self, revelation, of, keats, s, life, as, well, as, an, exposition, of, his, philosophy, with, the, first, drafts, of, poems, containing, some, of, keats, s, finest, writing, and, thought, gittings, sees, them, as, akin, to, a, spiritual, journal, not, written, for, a, specific, other, so, much, as, for, synthesis, keats, also, reflected, on, the, background, and, composition, of, his, poetry, specific, letters, often, coincide, with, or, anticipate, the, poems, they, describe, in, february, to, may, 1819, he, produced, many, of, his, finest, letters, writing, to, his, brother, george, keats, explored, the, idea, of, the, world, as, the, vale, of, soul, making, anticipating, the, great, odes, he, wrote, some, months, later, in, the, letters, keats, coined, ideas, such, as, the, mansion, of, many, apartments, and, the, chameleon, poet, which, came, to, gain, common, currency, and, capture, the, public, imagination, though, only, making, single, appearances, as, phrases, in, his, correspondence, the, poetical, mind, keats, argued, has, no, self, it, is, every, thing, and, nothing, it, has, no, character, it, enjoys, light, and, shade, what, shocks, the, virtuous, philosopher, delights, the, camelion, poet, it, does, no, harm, from, its, relish, of, the, dark, side, of, things, any, more, than, from, its, taste, for, the, bright, one, because, they, both, end, in, speculation, a, poet, is, the, most, unpoetical, of, any, thing, in, existence, because, he, has, no, identity, he, is, continually, in, for, and, filling, some, other, body, the, sun, the, moon, the, sea, and, men, and, women, who, are, creatures, of, impulse, are, poetical, and, have, about, them, an, unchangeable, attribute, the, poet, has, none, no, identity, he, is, certainly, the, most, unpoetical, of, all, god, s, creatures, he, used, the, term, negative, capability, to, discuss, the, state, of, being, in, which, we, are, capable, of, being, in, uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without, any, irritable, reaching, after, fact, reason, content, with, half, knowledge, where, one, trusts, in, the, heart, s, perceptions, he, wrote, later, he, was, certain, of, nothing, but, the, holiness, of, the, heart, s, affections, and, the, truth, of, imagination, what, the, imagination, seizes, as, beauty, must, be, truth, whether, it, existed, before, or, not, for, i, have, the, same, idea, of, all, our, passions, as, of, love, they, are, all, in, their, sublime,

than, the, chilly, green, of, spring, somehow, the, stubble, plain, looks, warm, in, the, same, way, as, some, pictures, look, warm, this, struck, me, so, much, in, my, sunday, s, walk, that, i,

there, are, areas, of, his, life, and, daily, routine, that, keats, omits, he, mentions, little, of, his, childhood, or, his, financial, straits, being, seemingly, embarrassed, to, discuss, them, there, is, no, reference, to, his, parents, in, his, last, year, as, his, health, deteriorated, his, concerns, often, give, way, to, despair, and, morbid, obsessions, his, letters, to, fanny, brawne,
