beat, his, former, trainer, and, veteran, boxer, archie, moore, in, a, 1962, match, these, early, fights, were, not, without, trials, clay, was, knocked, down, by, both, sonny, banks, and, cooper, in, the, cooper, fight, clay, was, floored, by, a, left, hook, at, the, end, of, round, four, and, was, saved, by, the, bell, going, on, to, win, in, the, predicted, fifth, round, due, to, cooper, s, severely, cut, eye, the, fight, with, doug, jones, on, march, 13, 1963, was, clay, s, toughest, fight, during, this, stretch, the, number, two, and, three, heavyweight, contenders, respectively, clay, and, jones, fought, on, jones, home, turf, at, new, york, s, madison, square, garden, jones, staggered, clay, in, the, first, round, and, the, unanimous, decision, for, clay, was, greeted, by, boos, and, a, rain, of, debris, thrown, into, the, ring, watching, on, closed, circuit, tv, heavyweight, champ, sonny, liston, quipped, that, if, he, fought, clay, he, liston, might, get, locked, up, for, murder, the, fight, was, later, named, fight, of, the, year, by, the, ring, magazine, in, each, of, these, fights, clay, vocally, belittled, his, opponents, and, vaunted, his, abilities, he, called, jones, an, ugly, little, man, and, cooper, a, bum, he, said, he, was, embarrassed, to, get, in, the, ring, with, alex, miteff, and, claimed, that, madison, square, garden, was, too, small, for, me, ali, s, trash, talk, was, inspired, by, professional, wrestler, gorgeous, george, wagner, s, after, he, saw, george, s, talking, ability, attract, huge, crowds, to, events, in, a, 1969, interview, he, stated, that, he, met, with, george, in, las, vegas, in, 1961, that, george, told, him, that, talking, a, big, game, would, earn, paying, fans, who, either, wanted, to, see, him, win, or, wanted, to, see, him, lose, thus, clay, transformed, himself, into, a, self, described, big, mouth, and, a, bragger, in, 1960, clay, left, moore, s, camp, partially, due, to, clay, s, refusal, to, do, chores, such, as, washing, dishes, and, sweeping, to, replace, moore, clay, hired, angelo, dundee, to, be, his, trainer, clay, had, met, dundee, in, february, 1957, during, clay, s, amateur, career, around, this, time, clay, sought, longtime, idol, sugar, ray, robinson, to, be, his, manager, but, was, rebuffed, by, late, 1963, clay, had, become, the, top, contender, for, sonny, liston, s, title, the, fight, was, set, for, february, 25, 1964, in, miami, beach, liston, was, an, intimidating, personality, a, dominating, fighter, with, a, criminal, past, and, ties, to, the, mob, based, on, clay, s, uninspired, performance, against, jones, and, cooper, in, his, previous, two, fights, and, liston, s, destruction, of, former, heavyweight, champion, floyd, patterson, in, two, first, round, knockouts, clay, was, an, 8, 1, underdog, despite, this, clay, taunted, liston, during, the, pre, fight, buildup, dubbing, him, the, big, ugly, bear, claiming, liston, even, smells, like, a, bear, and, i, m, gonna, give, him, to, the, local, zoo, after, i, whup, him, clay, turned, the, pre, fight, weigh, in, into, a, circus, shouting, at, liston, that, someone, is, going, to, die, at, ringside, tonight, clay, s, pulse, rate, was, measured, at, 120, more, than, double, his, normal, 54, many, of, those, in, attendance, thought, clay, s, behavior, stemmed, from, fear, and, some, commentators, wondered, if, he, would, show, up, for, the, bout, the, outcome, of, the, fight, was, a, major, upset, at, the, opening, bell, liston, rushed, at, clay, seemingly, angry, and, looking, for, a, quick, knockout, however, clay, s, superior, speed, and, mobility, enabled, him, to, elude, liston, making, the, champion, miss, and, look, awkward, at, the, end, of, the, first, round, clay, opened, up, his, attack, and, hit, liston, repeatedly, with, jabs, liston, fought, better, in, round, two, but, at, the, beginning, of, the, third, round, clay, hit, liston, with, a, combination, that, buckled, his, knees, and, opened, a, cut, under, his, left, eye, this, was, the, first, time, liston, had, ever, been, cut, at, the, end, of, round, four, clay, was, returning, to, his, corner, when, he, began, experiencing, blinding, pain, in, his, eyes, and, asked, his, trainer, angelo, dundee, to, cut, off, his, gloves, dundee, refused, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, problem, was, due, to, ointment, used, to, seal, liston, s, cuts, perhaps, deliberately, applied, by, his, corner, to, his, gloves, though, unconfirmed, boxing, historian, bert, sugar, said, that, two, of, liston, s, opponents, also, complained, about, their, eyes, burning, despite, liston, s, attempts, to, knock, out, a, blinded, clay, clay, was, able, to, survive, the, fifth, round, until, sweat, and, tears, rinsed, the, irritation, from, his, eyes, in, the, sixth, clay, dominated, hitting, liston, repeatedly, liston, did, not, answer, the, bell, for, the, seventh, round, and, clay, was, declared, the, winner, by, tko, liston, stated, that, the, reason, he, quit, was, an, injured, shoulder, following, the, win, a, triumphant, clay, rushed, to, the, edge, of, the, ring, and, pointing, to, the, ringside, press, shouted, eat, your, words, he, added, i, am, the, greatest, i, shook, up, the, world, i, m, the, prettiest, thing, that, ever, lived, at, ringside, post, fight, clay, appeared, unconvinced, that, the, fight, was, stopped, due, to, a, liston, shoulder, injury, saying, that, the, only, injury, liston, had, was, an, open, eye, a, big, cut, eye, when, told, by, joe, louis, that, the, injury, was, a, left, arm, thrown, out, of, its, socket, clay, quipped, yeah, swinging, at, nothing, who, wouldn, t, in, winning, this, fight, at, the, age, of, 22, clay, became, the, youngest, boxer, to, take, the, title, from, a, reigning, heavyweight, champion, however, floyd, patterson, remained, the, youngest, to, win, the, heavyweight, championship, doing, so, at, the, age, 21, during, an, elimination, bout, following, rocky, marciano, s, retirement, mike, tyson, broke, both, records, in, 1986, when, he, defeated, trevor, berbick, to, win, the, heavyweight, title, at, age, 20, the, feat, also, made, clay, the, fastest, boxer, to, win, the, championship, non, vacant, in, the, modern, era, doing, so, in, 20, bouts, soon, after, the, liston, fight, clay, changed, his, name, to, cassius, x, and, then, later, to, muhammad, ali, upon, converting, to, the, nation, of, islam, ali, then, faced, a, rematch, with, liston, scheduled, for, may, 1965, in, lewiston, maine, it, had, been, scheduled, for, boston, the, previous, november, but, was, postponed, for, six, months, due, to, ali, s, emergency, surgery, for, a, hernia, three, days, before, the, fight, was, controversial, midway, through, the, first, round, liston, was, knocked, down, by, a, difficult, to, see, blow, the, press, dubbed, a, phantom, punch, referee, jersey, joe, walcott, did, not, begin, the, count, immediately, after, the, knockdown, as, ali, refused, to, retreat, to, a, neutral, corner, liston, rose, after, he, had, been, down, for, about, 20, seconds, and, the, fight, momentarily, continued, however, a, few, seconds, later, walcott, having, been, informed, by, the, timekeepers, that, liston, had, been, down, for, a, count, of, 10, stopped, the, match, and, declared, ali, the, winner, by, knockout, the, entire, fight, lasted, less, than, two, minutes, it, has, since, been, speculated, that, liston, purposely, dropped, to, the, ground, proposed, motivations, include, threats, on, his, life, from, the, nation, of, islam, that, he, had, bet, against, himself, and, that, he, took, a, dive, to, pay, off, debts, slow, motion, replays, show, that, liston, was, jarred, by, a, chopping, right, from, ali, although, it, is, unclear, whether, the, blow, was, a, genuine, knockout, punch, ali, defended, his, title, against, former, heavyweight, champion, floyd, patterson, on, november, 22, 1965, before, the, match, ali, mocked, patterson, who, was, widely, known, to, call, him, by, his, former, name, cassius, clay, as, an, uncle, tom, calling, him, the, rabbit, although, ali, had, the, better, of, patterson, who, appeared, injured, during, the, fight, the, match, lasted, 12, rounds, before, being, called, on, a, technical, knockout, patterson, later, said, he, had, strained, his, sacroiliac, ali, was, criticized, in, the, sports, media, for, appearing, to, have, toyed, with, patterson, during, the, fight, patterson, biographer, w, k, stratton, claims, that, the, conflict, between, ali, and, patterson, was, not, genuine, but, was, staged, to, increase, ticket, sales, and, the, closed, circuit, viewing, audience, with, both, men, complicit, in, the, theatrics, stratton, also, cites, an, interview, by, howard, cosell, in, which, ali, explained, that, rather, than, toying, with, patterson, he, refrained, from, knocking, him, out, after, it, became, apparent, patterson, was, injured, patterson, later, said, that, he, had, never, been, hit, by, punches, as, soft, as, ali, s, stratton, states, that, ali, arranged, the, second, fight, in, 1972, with, the, financially, struggling, patterson, to, help, the, former, champion, earn, enough, money, to, pay, a, debt, to, the, irs, after, the, patterson, fight, ali, founded, his, own, promotion, company, main, bout, the, company, mainly, handled, ali, s, boxing, promotions, and, pay, per, view, closed, circuit, television, broadcasts, the, company, s, stockholders, were, mainly, fellow, nation, of, islam, members, along, with, several, others, including, bob, arum, ali, and, then, wba, heavyweight, champion, boxer, ernie, terrell, had, agreed, to, meet, for, a, bout, in, chicago, on, march, 29, 1966, the, wba, one, of, two, boxing, associations, had, stripped, ali, of, his, title, following, his, joining, the, nation, of, islam, but, in, february, ali, was, reclassified, by, the, louisville, draft, board, as, 1, a, from, 1, y, and, he, indicated, that, he, would, refuse, to, serve, commenting, to, the, press, i, ain, t, got, nothing, against, no, viet, cong, no, viet, cong, never, called, me, nigger, although, the, second, part, is, probably, apocryphal, amidst, the, media, and, public, outcry, over, ali, s, stance, the, illinois, athletic, commission, refused, to, sanction, the, fight, citing, technicalities, instead, ali, traveled, to, canada, and, europe, and, won, championship, bouts, against, george, chuvalo, henry, cooper, brian, london, and, karl, mildenberger, ali, returned, to, the, united, states, to, fight, cleveland, williams, at, the, astrodome, in, houston, on, november, 14, 1966, the, bout, drew, a, record, breaking, indoor, crowd, of, 35, 460, people, williams, had, once, been, considered, among, the, hardest, punchers, in, the, heavyweight, division, but, in, 1964, he, had, been, shot, at, point, blank, range, by, a, texas, policeman, resulting, in, the, loss, of, one, kidney, and, 3, 0, metres, 10, ft, of, his, small, intestine, ali, dominated, williams, winning, a, third, round, technical, knockout, in, what, some, consider, the, finest, performance, of, his, career, ali, fought, terrell, in, houston, on, february, 6, 1967, terrell, who, was, unbeaten, in, five, years, and, had, defeated, many, of, the, boxers, ali, had, faced, was, billed, as, ali, s, toughest, opponent, since, liston, he, was, big, strong, and, had, a, three, inch, reach, advantage, over, ali, during, the, lead, up, to, the, bout, terrell, repeatedly, called, ali, clay, much, to, ali, s, annoyance, the, two, almost, came, to, blows, over, the, name, issue, in, a, pre, fight, interview, with, howard, cosell, ali, seemed, intent, on, humiliating, terrell, i, want, to, torture, him, he, said, a, clean, knockout, is, too, good, for, him, the, fight, was, close, until, the, seventh, round, when, ali, bloodied, terrell, and, almost, knocked, him, out, in, the, eighth, round, ali, taunted, terrell, hitting, him, with, jabs, and, shouting, between, punches, what, s, my, name, uncle, tom, what, s, my, name, ali, won, a, unanimous, 15, round, decision, terrell, claimed, that, early, in, the, fight, ali, deliberately, thumbed, him, in, the, eye, forcing, him, to, fight, half, blind, and, then, in, a, clinch, rubbed, the, wounded, eye, against, the, ropes, because, of, ali, s, apparent, intent, to, prolong, the, fight, to, inflict, maximum, punishment, critics, described, the, bout, as, one, of, the, ugliest, boxing, fights, tex, maule, later, wrote, it, was, a, wonderful, demonstration, of, boxing, skill, and, a, barbarous, display, of, cruelty, ali, denied, the, accusations, of, cruelty, but, for, ali, s, critics, the, fight, provided, more, evidence, of, his, arrogance, after, ali, s, title, defense, against, zora, folley, on, march, 22, he, was, stripped, of, his, title, due, to, his, refusal, to, be, drafted, to, army, service, his, boxing, license,

bullets, on, brown, people, in, vietnam, while, so, called, negro, people, in, louisville, are, treated, like, dogs, and, denied, simple, human, rights, ali, antagonized, the, white, establishment, in, 1966, by, refusing, to, be, drafted, into, the, u, s, military, citing, his, religious, beliefs, and, opposition, to, american, involvement, in, the, vietnam, war, on, april, 28, 1967, ali, appeared, in, houston, for, his, scheduled, induction, into, the, u, s, armed, forces, but, he, refused, three, times, to, step, forward, when, his, name, was, called, an, officer, warned, him, that, he, was, committing, a, felony, punishable, by, five, years, in, prison, and, a, fine, of, 10, 000, once, more, ali, refused, to, budge, when, his, name, was, called, and, he, was, arrested, later, that, same, day, the, new, york, state, athletic, commission, suspended, his, boxing, license, and, the, world, boxing, association, stripped, him, of, his, title, other, boxing, commissions, followed, suit, ali, remained, unable, to, obtain, a, license, to, box, in, any, state, for, over, three, years, on, june, 4, 1967, in, a, first, for, sports, professionals, a, group, of, high, profile, african, american, athletes, including, jim, brown, bill, russell, and, kareem, abdul, jabbar, as, well, as, one, political, leader, carl, stokes, assembled, with, ali, at, the, negro, industrial, economic, union, in, cleveland, for, what, became, known, as, the, cleveland, summit, or, the, muhammad, ali, summit, the, meeting, was, organized, by, brown, for, his, peers, to, question, ali, about, the, seriousness, of, his, convictions, and, to, decide, whether, to, support, him, which, they, ultimately, did, at, the, trial, on, june, 20, 1967, the, jury, found, ali, guilty, after, only, 21, minutes, of, deliberation, of, the, criminal, offense, of, violating, the, selective, service, laws, by, refusing, to, be, drafted, after, a, court, of, appeals, upheld, the, conviction, the, case, was, reviewed, by, the, u, s, supreme, court, in, 1971, ali, remained, free, in, the, years, between, the, appellate, court, decision, and, the, supreme, court, ruling, as, public, opinion, began, turning, against, the, war, and, the, civil, rights, movement, continued, to, gather, momentum, ali, became, a, popular, speaker, at, colleges, and, universities, across, the, country, this, itinerary, was, rare, if, not, unprecedented, for, a, prizefighter, at, howard, university, for, example, he, gave, his, popular, black, is, best, speech, to, 4, 000, cheering, students, and, community, intellectuals, after, he, was, invited, to, speak, by, sociology, professor, nathan, hare, on, behalf, of, the, black, power, committee, a, student, protest, group, on, june, 28, 1971, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, in, clay, v, united, states, overturned, ali, s, conviction, by, a, unanimous, 8, 0, decision, justice, thurgood, marshall, recused, himself, as, he, had, been, the, u, s, solicitor, general, at, the, time, of, ali, s, conviction, the, decision, was, not, based, on, nor, did, it, address, the, merits, of, ali, s, claims, per, se, rather, the, court, held, that, since, the, appeal, board, gave, no, reason, for, the, denial, of, a, conscientious, objector, exemption, to, ali, that, it, was, therefore, impossible, to, determine, which, of, the, three, basic, tests, for, conscientious, objector, status, offered, in, the, justice, department, s, brief, the, appeal, board, relied, on, and, ali, s, conviction, must, be, reversed, in, a, 1974, interview, ali, said, if, they, say, stand, and, salute, the, flag, i, do, that, out, of, respect, because, i, m, in, the, country, ali, would, later, say, if, america, was, in, trouble, and, real, war, came, i, d, be, on, the, front, line, if, we, had, been, attacked, but, i, could, see, that, wasn, t, right, he, also, said, black, men, would, go, over, there, and, fight, but, when, they, came, home, they, couldn, t, even, be, served, a, hamburger, ali, s, example, inspired, many, black, americans, and, others, however, initially, when, he, refused, induction, he, became, arguably, the, most, hated, man, in, the, country, and, received, many, death, threats, people, who, supported, ali, during, this, time, were, also, threatened, including, sports, journalist, jerry, izenberg, whose, columns, defended, ali, s, decision, not, to, serve, he, wrote, bomb, threats, emptied, our, office, making, the, staff, stand, out, in, the, snow, my, car, windshield, was, smashed, with, a, sledgehammer, the, new, york, times, columnist, william, rhoden, wrote, ali, s, actions, changed, my, standard, of, what, constituted, an, athlete, s, greatness, possessing, a, killer, jump, shot, or, the, ability, to, stop, on, a, dime, was, no, longer, enough, what, were, you, doing, for, the, liberation, of, your, people, what, were, you, doing, to, help, your, country, live, up, to, the, covenant, of, its, founding, principles, recalling, ali, s, anti, war, position, kareem, abdul, jabbar, said, i, remember, the, teachers, at, my, high, school, didn, t, like, ali, because, he, was, so, anti, establishment, and, he, kind, of, thumbed, his, nose, at, authority, and, got, away, with, it, the, fact, that, he, was, proud, to, be, a, black, man, and, that, he, had, so, much, talent, made, some, people, think, that, he, was, dangerous, but, for, those, very, reasons, i, enjoyed, him, civil, rights, figures, came, to, believe, that, ali, had, an, energizing, effect, on, the, freedom, movement, as, a, whole, al, sharpton, spoke, of, his, bravery, at, a, time, when, there, was, still, widespread, support, for, the, vietnam, war, for, the, heavyweight, champion, of, the, world, who, had, achieved, the, highest, level, of, athletic, celebrity, to, put, all, of, that, on, the, line, the, money, the, ability, to, get, endorsements, to, sacrifice, all, of, that, for, a, cause, gave, a, whole, sense, of, legitimacy, to, the, movement, and, the, causes, with, young, people, that, nothing, else, could, have, done, even, those, who, were, assassinated, certainly, lost, their, lives, but, they, didn, t, voluntarily, do, that, he, knew, he, was, going, to, jail, and, did, it, anyway, that, s, another, level, of, leadership, and, sacrifice, ali, was, honored, with, the, annual, martin, luther, king, award, in, 1970, by, civil, rights, leader, ralph, abernathy, who, called, him, a, living, example, of, soul, power, the, march, on, washington, in, two, fists, coretta, scott, king, added, that, ali, was, a, champion, of, justice, and, peace, and, unity, in, speaking, of, the, cost, on, ali, s, career, of, his, refusal, to, be, drafted, his, trainer, angelo, dundee, said, one, thing, must, be, taken, into, account, when, talking, about, ali, he, was, robbed, of, his, best, years, his, prime, years, ali, s, promoter, bob, arum, did, not, support, ali, s, choice, at, the, time, but, in, 2016, arum, stated, when, i, look, back, at, his, life, and, i, was, blessed, to, call, him, a, friend, and, spent, a, lot, of, time, with, him, it, s, hard, for, me, to, talk, about, his, exploits, in, boxing, because, as, great, as, they, were, they, paled, in, comparison, to, the, impact, that, he, had, on, the, world, he, did, what, he, thought, was, right, and, it, turned, out, he, was, right, and, i, was, wrong, ali, s, resistance, to, the, draft, was, covered, in, the, 2013, documentary, the, trials, of, muhammad, ali, in, a, secret, operation, code, named, minaret, the, national, security, agency, nsa, intercepted, the, communications, of, leading, americans, including, ali, senators, frank, church, and, howard, baker, dr, martin, luther, king, jr, prominent, u, s, journalists, and, others, who, criticized, the, u, s, war, in, vietnam, a, review, by, the, nsa, of, the, minaret, program, concluded, that, it, was, disreputable, if, not, outright, illegal, in, 1971, ali, s, fight, of, the, century, with, frazier, was, used, by, an, activist, group, the, citizens, commission, to, investigate, the, fbi, to, pull, off, a, burglary, at, an, fbi, office, in, pennsylvania, the, anticipation, for, the, fight, was, unlike, anything, else, so, they, believed, the, security, would, also, be, focused, on, the, fight, this, raid, exposed, the, cointelpro, operations, that, included, illegal, spying, on, activists, involved, with, the, civil, rights, and, anti, war, movements, one, of, the, cointelpro, targets, was, ali, and, their, activities, included, the, fbi, gaining, access, to, his, records, as, far, back, as, elementary, school, one, such, record, mentioned, him, loving, art, as, a, child, in, march, 1966, ali, refused, to, be, inducted, into, the, armed, forces, he, was, systematically, denied, a, boxing, license, in, every, state, and, stripped, of, his, passport, as, a, result, he, did, not, fight, from, march, 1967, to, october, 1970, from, ages, 25, to, almost, 29, as, his, case, worked, its, way, through, the, appeals, process, before, his, conviction, was, overturned, in, 1971, during, this, time, of, inactivity, as, opposition, to, the, vietnam, war, began, to, grow, and, ali, s, stance, gained, sympathy, he, spoke, at, colleges, across, the, nation, criticizing, the, vietnam, war, and, advocating, african, american, pride, and, racial, justice, ali, based, himself, in, chicago, according, to, most, close, to, him, his, chicago, years, were, formative, at, the, time, ali, was, widely, condemned, by, the, american, media, with, fears, that, his, actions, could, potentially, lead, to, mass, civil, disobedience, despite, this, ebony, magazine, noted, in, the, late, 1960s, that, ali, s, popularity, had, increased, during, this, time, especially, among, black, people, while, banned, from, sanctioned, bouts, ali, settled, a, 1, million, lawsuit, against, radio, producer, murray, woroner, by, accepting, 10, 000, to, appear, in, a, privately, staged, fantasy, fight, against, retired, champion, rocky, marciano, in, 1969, the, boxers, were, filmed, sparring, for, about, 75, one, minute, rounds, they, produced, several, potential, outcomes, a, computer, program, purportedly, determined, the, winner, based, on, data, about, the, fighters, along, with, the, opinions, of, approximately, 250, boxing, experts, edited, versions, of, the, bout, were, shown, in, movie, theaters, in, 1970, in, the, u, s, version, ali, lost, in, a, simulated, 13th, round, knockout, but, in, the, european, version, marciano, lost, due, to, cuts, also, simulated, ali, suggested, that, prejudice, determined, his, defeat, in, the, u, s, version, he, was, reported, to, have, jokingly, said, that, computer, was, made, in, alabama, on, august, 11, 1970, with, his, case, still, in, appeal, ali, was, granted, a, license, to, box, by, the, city, of, atlanta, athletic, commission, leroy, johnson, jesse, hill, jr, and, harry, pett, had, used, their, local, political, influence, and, set, up, the, company, house, of, sports, to, organize, the, fight, underlining, the, influential, power, of, georgia, s, black, politics, in, ali, s, comeback, ali, s, first, return, bout, was, against, jerry, quarry, on, october, 26, resulting, in, a, win, after, three, rounds, after, quarry, was, cut, a, month, earlier, a, victory, in, federal, court, forced, the, new, york, state, boxing, commission, to, reinstate, ali, s, license, he, fought, oscar, bonavena, at, madison, square, garden, in, december, an, uninspired, performance, that, ended, in, a, dramatic, technical, knockout, of, bonavena, in, the, 15th, round, the, win, left, ali, as, a, top, contender, against, heavyweight, champion, joe, frazier, ali, and, frazier, s, first, fight, held, at, the, garden, on, march, 8, 1971, was, nicknamed, the, fight, of, the, century, due, to, the, tremendous, excitement, surrounding, a, bout, between, two, undefeated, fighters, each, with, a, legitimate, claim, to, be, heavyweight, champion, veteran, us, boxing, writer, john, condon, called, it, the, greatest, event, i, ve, ever, worked, on, in, my, life, the, bout, was, broadcast, to, 36, countries, promoters, granted, 760, press, passes, adding, to, the, atmosphere, were, the, considerable, pre, fight, theatrics, and, name, calling, before, the, fight, frazier, called, ali, cassius, clay, this, angered, ali, and, he, portrayed, frazier, as, a, dumb, tool, of, the, white, establishment, frazier, is, too, ugly, to, be, champ, ali, said, frazier, is, too, dumb, to, be, champ, ali, also, frequently, called, frazier, an, uncle, tom, dave, wolf, who, worked, in, frazier, s, camp, recalled, that, ali, was, saying, the, only, people, rooting, for, joe, frazier, are, white, people, in, suits, alabama, sheriffs, and, members, of, the, ku, klux, klan, i, m, fighting, for, the, little, man, in, the, ghetto, joe, was, sitting, there, smashing, his, fist, into, the, palm, of, his, hand, saying, what, the, fuck, does, he, know, about, the, ghetto, ali, began, training, at, a, farm, near, reading, pennsylvania, in, 1971, and, finding, the, country, setting, to, his, liking, sought, to, develop, a, real, training, camp, in, the, countryside, he, found, a, five, acre, site, on, a, pennsylvania, country, road, in, the, village, of, deer, lake, pennsylvania, on, this, site, ali, carved, out, what, was, to, become, his, training, camp, where, he, trained, for, all, his, fights, from, 1972, to, the, end, of, his, career, in, 1981, the, monday, night, fight, lived, up, to, its, billing, in, a, preview, of, their, two, other, fights, a, crouching, bobbing, and, weaving, frazier, constantly, pressured, ali, getting, hit, regularly, by, ali, jabs, and, combinations, but, relentlessly, attacking, and, scoring, repeatedly, especially, to, ali, s, body, the, fight, was, even, in, the, early, rounds, but, ali, was, taking, more, punishment, than, ever, in, his, career, up, until, that, point, on, several, occasions, in, the, early, rounds, he, played, to, the, crowd, and, shook, his, head, no, after, he, was, hit, in, the, later, rounds, in, what, was, the, first, appearance, of, the, rope, a, dope, strategy, ali, leaned, against, the, ropes, and, absorbed, punishment, from, frazier, hoping, to, tire, him, in, the, 11th, round, frazier, connected, with, a, left, hook, that, wobbled, ali, but, because, it, appeared, that, ali, might, be, clowning, as, he, staggered, backwards, across, the, ring, frazier, hesitated, to, press, his, advantage, fearing, an, ali, counterattack, in, the, final, round, frazier, knocked, ali, down, with, a, vicious, left, hook, which, referee, arthur, mercante, said, was, as, hard, as, a, man, can, be, hit, ali, was, back, on, his, feet, in, three, seconds, nevertheless, ali, lost, by, unanimous, decision, his, first, professional, defeat, in, 1971, basketball, star, wilt, chamberlain, challenged, ali, to, a, fight, and, a, bout, was, scheduled, for, july, 26, although, the, seven, foot, two, inch, tall, chamberlain, had, formidable, physical, advantages, over, ali, weighing, 60, pounds, more, and, able, to, reach, 14, inches, further, ali, was, able, to, influence, chamberlain, into, calling, off, the, bout, by, taunting, him, with, calls, of, timber, and, the, tree, will, fall, during, a, shared, interview, these, statements, of, confidence, unsettled, his, taller, opponent, whom, los, angeles, lakers, owner, jack, kent, cooke, had, offered, a, record, setting, contract, conditional, on, chamberlain, agreeing, to, abandon, what, cooke, termed, this, boxing, foolishness, and, he, did, exactly, that, to, replace, ali, s, opponent, promoter, bob, arum, quickly, booked, a, former, sparring, partner, of, ali, s, jimmy, ellis, who, was, a, childhood, friend, from, louisville, kentucky, to, fight, him, ali, won, the, bout, through, a, technical, knockout, when, the, referee, stopped, the, fight, in, the, twelfth, round, after, the, loss, to, frazier, ali, fought, jerry, quarry, had, a, second, bout, with, floyd, patterson, and, faced, bob, foster, in, 1972, winning, a, total, of, six, fights, that, year, during, two, bouts, he, had, in, 1973, with, joe, bugner, and, ken, norton, he, wore, a, people, s, choice, robe, which, was, given, to, him, by, elvis, presley, in, 1973, before, his, fight, with, norton, tom, cushman, said, ali, was, gloriously, overconfident, he, didn, t, consider, this, guy, a, threat, at, all, but, during, the, fight, either, in, the, 2nd, round, according, to, most, press, reports, or, the, final, round, according, to, norton, norton, broke, ali, s, jaw, and, inflicted, by, decision, the, second, loss, of, his, career, after, considering, retirement, ali, won, a, controversial, decision, against, norton, in, their, second, bout, this, led, to, a, rematch, with, joe, frazier, at, madison, square, garden, on, january, 28, 1974, frazier, had, recently, lost, his, title, to, george, foreman, ali, was, strong, in, the, early, rounds, of, the, fight, and, staggered, frazier, in, the, second, round, referee, tony, perez, mistakenly, thought, he, heard, the, bell, ending, the, round, and, stepped, between, the, two, fighters, as, ali, was, pressing, his, attack, giving, frazier, time, to, recover, however, frazier, came, on, in, the, middle, rounds, snapping, ali, s, head, in, round, seven, and, driving, him, to, the, ropes, at, the, end, of, round, eight, the, last, four, rounds, saw, round, to, round, shifts, in, momentum, between, the, two, fighters, throughout, most, of, the, bout, however, ali, was, able, to, circle, away, from, frazier, s, dangerous, left, hook, and, to, tie, frazier, up, when, he, was, cornered, the, latter, a, tactic, that, frazier, s, camp, complained, of, bitterly, judges, awarded, ali, a, unanimous, decision, the, defeat, of, frazier, set, the, stage, for, a, title, fight, against, heavyweight, champion, george, foreman, in, kinshasa, zaire, on, october, 30, 1974, a, bout, nicknamed, the, rumble, in, the, jungle, foreman, was, considered, one, of, the, hardest, punchers, in, heavyweight, history, in, assessing, the, fight, analysts, pointed, out, that, joe, frazier, and, ken, norton, who, had, given, ali, four, tough, battles, and, won, two, of, them, had, both, been, devastated, by, foreman, in, second, round, knockouts, ali, was, 32, years, old, and, had, lost, speed, and, reflexes, since, his, twenties, contrary, to, his, later, persona, foreman, was, at, the, time, a, brooding, and, intimidating, presence, almost, no, one, associated, with, the, sport, not, even, ali, s, long, time, supporter, howard, cosell, gave, the, former, champion, a, chance, of, winning, as, usual, ali, was, confident, and, colorful, before, the, fight, he, told, interviewer, david, frost, if, you, think, the, world, was, surprised, when, nixon, resigned, wait, till, i, whup, foreman, s, behind, he, told, the, press, i, ve, done, something, new, for, this, fight, i, done, wrestled, with, an, alligator, i, done, tussled, with, a, whale, handcuffed, lightning, thrown, thunder, in, jail, only, last, week, i, murdered, a, rock, injured, a, stone, hospitalized, a, brick, i, m, so, mean, i, make, medicine, sick, ali, was, wildly, popular, in, zaire, with, crowds, chanting, ali, bomaye, ali, kill, him, wherever, he, went, ali, opened, the, fight, moving, and, scoring, with, right, crosses, to, foreman, s, head, then, beginning, in, the, second, round, and, to, the, consternation, of, his, corner, ali, retreated, to, the, ropes, and, invited, foreman, to, hit, him, while, covering, up, clinching, and, counterpunching, all, while, verbally, taunting, foreman, the, move, which, would, later, become, known, as, the, rope, a, dope, so, violated, conventional, boxing, wisdom, letting, one, of, the, hardest, hitters, in, boxing, strike, at, will, that, at, ringside, writer, george, plimpton, thought, the, fight, had, to, be, fixed, foreman, increasingly, angered, threw, punches, that, were, deflected, and, did, not, land, squarely, midway, through, the, fight, as, foreman, began, tiring, ali, countered, more, frequently, and, effectively, with, punches, and, flurries, which, electrified, the, pro, ali, crowd, in, the, eighth, round, ali, dropped, an, exhausted, foreman, with, a, combination, at, center, ring, foreman, failed, to, make, the, count, against, the, odds, and, amidst, pandemonium, in, the, ring, ali, had, regained, the, title, by, knockout, reflecting, on, the, fight, george, foreman, later, said, i, thought, ali, was, just, one, more, knockout, victim, until, about, the, seventh, round, i, hit, him, hard, to, the, jaw, and, he, held, me, and, whispered, in, my, ear, that, all, you, got, george, i, realized, that, this, ain, t, what, i, thought, it, was, it, was, a, major, upset, victory, after, ali, came, in, as, a, 4, 1, underdog, against, the, previously, unbeaten, heavy, hitting, foreman, the, fight, became, famous, for, ali, s, introduction, of, the, rope, a, dope, tactic, the, fight, was, watched, by, a, record, estimated, television, audience, of, 1, billion, viewers, worldwide, it, was, the, world, s, most, watched, live, television, broadcast, at, the, time, ali, s, next, opponents, included, chuck, wepner, ron, lyle, and, joe, bugner, wepner, a, journeyman, known, as, the, bayonne, bleeder, stunned, ali, with, a, knockdown, in, the, ninth, round, ali, would, later, say, he, tripped, on, wepner, s, foot, the, fight, inspired, sylvester, stallone, to, create, the, acclaimed, film, rocky, ali, then, agreed, to, a, third, match, with, joe, frazier, in, manila, the, bout, known, as, the, thrilla, in, manila, was, held, on, october, 1, 1975, in, temperatures, approaching, 100, f, 38, c, in, the, first, rounds, ali, was, aggressive, moving, and, exchanging, blows, with, frazier, however, ali, soon, appeared, to, tire, and, adopted, the, rope, a, dope, strategy, frequently, resorting, to, clinches, during, this, part, of, the, bout, ali, did, some, effective, counterpunching, but, for, the, most, part, absorbed, punishment, from, a, relentlessly, attacking, frazier, in, the, 12th, round, frazier, began, to, tire, and, ali, scored, several, sharp, blows, that, closed, frazier, s, left, eye, and, opened, a, cut, over, his, right, eye, with, frazier, s, vision, now, diminished, ali, dominated, the, 13th, and, 14th, rounds, at, times, conducting, what, boxing, historian, mike, silver, called, target, practice, on, frazier, s, head, the, fight, was, stopped, when, frazier, s, trainer, eddie, futch, refused, to, allow, frazier, to, answer, the, bell, for, the, 15th, and, final, round, despite, frazier, s, protests, frazier, s, eyes, were, both, swollen, shut, ali, in, his, corner, winner, by, tko, slumped, on, his, stool, spent, an, ailing, ali, said, afterwards, that, the, fight, was, the, closest, thing, to, dying, that, i, know, and, when, later, asked, if, he, had, viewed, the, fight, on, videotape, reportedly, said, why, would, i, want, to, go, back, and, see, hell, after, the, fight, he, cited, frazier, as, the, greatest, fighter, of, all, times, next, to, me, after, the, third, fight, with, frazier, ali, considered, retirement, he, said, i, m, sore, all, over, my, arms, my, face, my, sides, all, ache, i, m, so, so, tired, there, is, a, great, possibility, that, i, will, retire, you, might, have, seen, the, last, of, me, i, want, to, sit, back, and, count, my, money, live, in, my, house, and, my, farm, work, for, my, people, and, concentrate, on, my, family, on, february, 2, 1976, ali, defeated, jean, pierre, coopman, by, 5th, round, knockout, the, wbc, heavyweight, title, was, not, on, the, line, for, this, fight, on, april, 30, 1976, ali, would, fight,

with, that, girl, ali, s, biographer, and, friend, thomas, hauser, has, said, this, claim, was, of, questionable, veracity, ali, said, that, he, first, heard, of, the, nation, of, islam, when, he, was, fighting, in, the, golden, gloves, tournament, in, chicago, in, 1959, and, attended, his, first, nation, of, islam, meeting, in, 1961, he, continued, to, attend, meetings, although, keeping, his, involvement, hidden, from, the, public, in, 1962, clay, met, malcolm, x, who, soon, became, his, spiritual, and, political, mentor, by, the, time, of, the, first, liston, fight, nation, of, islam, members, including, malcolm, x, were, visible, in, his, entourage, this, led, to, a, story, in, the, miami, herald, just, before, the, fight, disclosing, that, clay, had, joined, the, nation, of, islam, which, nearly, caused, the, bout, to, be, canceled, the, article, quoted, cassius, clay, sr, as, saying, that, his, son, had, joined, the, black, muslims, when, he, was, 18, in, fact, clay, was, initially, refused, entry, to, the, nation, of, islam, often, called, the, black, muslims, at, the, time, due, to, his, boxing, career, however, after, he, won, the, championship, from, liston, in, 1964, the, nation, of, islam, was, more, receptive, and, agreed, to, publicize, his, membership, shortly, afterwards, on, march, 6, elijah, muhammad, gave, a, radio, address, that, clay, would, be, renamed, muhammad, one, who, is, worthy, of, praise, ali, most, high, around, that, time, ali, moved, to, the, south, side, of, chicago, and, lived, in, a, series, of, houses, always, near, the, nation, of, islam, s, mosque, maryam, or, elijah, muhammad, s, residence, he, stayed, in, chicago, for, about, 12, years, only, a, few, journalists, most, notably, howard, cosell, accepted, the, new, name, at, that, time, ali, stated, that, his, earlier, name, was, a, slave, name, and, a, white, man, s, name, and, added, that, i, didn, t, choose, it, and, i, don, t, want, it, i, am, muhammad, ali, a, free, name, the, person, he, was, formerly, named, after, was, a, white, slave, owner, turned, abolitionist, ali, explained, in, his, autobiography, after, studying, his, works, he, may, have, gotten, rid, of, his, slaves, but, he, held, on, to, white, supremacy, ali, concluded, why, should, i, keep, my, white, slavemaster, s, name, visible, and, my, black, ancestors, invisible, unknown, unhonored, not, afraid, to, antagonize, the, white, establishment, ali, stated, i, am, america, i, am, the, part, you, won, t, recognize, but, get, used, to, me, black, confident, cocky, my, name, not, yours, my, religion, not, yours, my, goals, my, own, get, used, to, me, ali, s, friendship, with, malcolm, x, ended, as, malcolm, split, with, the, nation, of, islam, a, couple, of, weeks, after, ali, joined, and, ali, remained, with, the, nation, of, islam, ali, later, said, that, turning, his, back, on, malcolm, was, one, of, the, mistakes, he, regretted, most, in, his, life, aligning, himself, with, the, nation, of, islam, its, leader, elijah, muhammad, and, a, narrative, that, labeled, the, white, race, as, the, perpetrator, of, genocide, against, african, americans, made, ali, a, target, of, public, condemnation, the, nation, of, islam, was, widely, viewed, by, whites, and, some, african, americans, as, a, black, separatist, hate, religion, with, a, propensity, toward, violence, ali, had, few, qualms, about, using, his, influential, voice, to, speak, nation, of, islam, doctrine, in, a, press, conference, articulating, his, opposition, to, the, vietnam, war, ali, stated, my, enemy, is, the, white, people, not, vietcong, or, chinese, or, japanese, in, relation, to, integration, he, said, we, who, follow, the, teachings, of, elijah, muhammad, don, t, want, to, be, forced, to, integrate, integration, is, wrong, we, don, t, want, to, live, with, the, white, man, that, s, all, writer, jerry, izenberg, once, noted, that, the, nation, became, ali, s, family, and, elijah, muhammad, became, his, father, but, there, is, an, irony, to, the, fact, that, while, the, nation, branded, white, people, as, devils, ali, had, more, white, colleagues, than, most, african, american, people, did, at, that, time, in, america, and, continued, to, have, them, throughout, his, career, in, hauser, s, biography, muhammad, ali, his, life, and, times, ali, stated, that, he, was, not, a, christian, as, he, thought, the, idea, of, god, having, a, son, sounded, wrong, and, did, not, make, sense, to, him, stating, god, don, t, beget, man, begets, however, he, still, believed, that, even, good, christians, or, good, jews, could, receive, god, s, blessing, and, enter, heaven, as, he, stated, god, created, all, people, no, matter, what, their, religion, he, also, stated, if, you, re, against, someone, because, he, s, a, muslim, that, s, wrong, if, you, re, against, someone, because, he, s, a, christian, or, a, jew, that, s, wrong, in, a, 2004, autobiography, ali, attributed, his, conversion, to, mainstream, sunni, islam, to, warith, deen, muhammad, who, assumed, leadership, of, the, nation, of, islam, upon, the, death, of, his, father, elijah, muhammad, and, persuaded, the, nation, s, followers, to, become, adherents, of, sunni, islam, he, said, some, people, did, not, like, the, change, and, stuck, to, elijah, s, teachings, but, he, admired, it, and, so, left, elijah, s, teachings, and, became, a, follower, of, sunni, islam, ali, had, gone, on, the, hajj, pilgrimage, to, mecca, in, 1972, which, inspired, him, in, a, similar, manner, to, malcolm, x, meeting, people, of, different, colors, from, all, over, the, world, giving, him, a, different, outlook, and, greater, spiritual, awareness, in, 1977, he, said, that, after, he, retired, he, would, dedicate, the, rest, of, his, life, to, getting, ready, to, meet, god, by, helping, people, charitable, causes, uniting, people, and, helping, to, make, peace, he, went, on, another, hajj, pilgrimage, to, mecca, in, 1988, after, the, september, 11, attacks, in, 2001, he, stated, that, islam, is, a, religion, of, peace, and, does, not, promote, terrorism, or, killing, people, and, that, he, was, angry, that, the, world, sees, a, certain, group, of, islam, followers, who, caused, this, destruction, but, they, are, not, real, muslims, they, are, racist, fanatics, who, call, themselves, muslims, in, december, 2015, after, the, november, 2015, paris, attacks, he, stated, that, true, muslims, know, that, the, ruthless, violence, of, so, called, islamic, jihadists, goes, against, the, very, tenets, of, our, religion, that, we, as, muslims, have, to, stand, up, to, those, who, use, islam, to, advance, their, own, personal, agenda, and, that, political, leaders, should, use, their, position, to, bring, understanding, about, the, religion, of, islam, and, clarify, that, these, misguided, murderers, have, perverted, people, s, views, on, what, islam, really, is, he, also, developed, an, interest, in, sufism, which, he, referenced, in, his, autobiography, the, soul, of, a, butterfly, according, to, ali, s, daughter, hana, yasmeen, ali, who, co, authored, the, soul, of,

such, as, grand, mufti, of, syria, al, marhum, al, sheikh, ahmed, kuftaro, hisham, kabbani, imam, zaid, shakir, hamza, yusuf, and, timothy, j, gianotti, who, was, at, ali, s, bedside, during, his, last, days, and, ensured, that, although, his, funeral, was, interfaith, it, was, still, in, accordance, with, islamic, rites, and, rituals, during, his, amateur, career, ali, refrained, from, smoking, drugs, and, drinking, alcohol, and, soda, pop, and, adopted, an, idiosyncratic, diet, upon, his, acceptance, of, the, dietary, restrictions, of, islam, the, nation, of, islam, recruited,
