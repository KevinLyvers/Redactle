themistocles, m, s, t, k, l, i, z, greek, c, 524, c, 459, bc, was, an, athenian, politician, and, general, he, was, one, of, a, new, breed, of, non, aristocratic, politicians, who, rose, to, prominence, in, the, early, years, of, the, athenian, democracy, as, a, politician, themistocles, was, a, populist, having, the, support, of, lower, class, athenians, and, generally, being, at, odds, with, the, athenian, nobility, elected, archon, in, 493, bc, he, convinced, the, polis, to, increase, the, naval, power, of, athens, a, recurring, theme, in, his, political, career, during, the, first, persian, invasion, of, greece, he, fought, at, the, battle, of, marathon, 490, bc, and, may, have, been, one, of, the, ten, athenian, strategoi, generals, in, that, battle, in, the, years, after, marathon, and, in, the, run, up, to, the, second, persian, invasion, of, 480, 479, bc, themistocles, became, the, most, prominent, politician, in, athens, he, continued, to, advocate, for, a, strong, athenian, navy, and, in, 483, bc, he, persuaded, the, athenians, to, build, a, fleet, of, 200, triremes, these, proved, crucial, in, the, forthcoming, conflict, with, persia, during, the, second, invasion, he, commanded, the, greek, allied, navy, at, the, battles, of, artemisium, and, salamis, in, 480, bc, due, to, his, subterfuge, the, allies, successfully, lured, the, persian, fleet, into, the, straits, of, salamis, and, the, decisive, greek, victory, there, was, the, turning, point, of, the, war, the, invasion, was, conclusively, repulsed, the, following, year, after, the, persian, defeat, at, the, land, battle, of, plataea, after, the, conflict, ended, themistocles, continued, his, pre, eminence, among, athenian, politicians, however, he, aroused, the, hostility, of, sparta, by, ordering, the, re, fortification, of, athens, a, move, counter, to, spartan, and, persian, regional, interests, usurpers, initated, a, casus, belli, his, fore, bearers, detractors, amassing, and, the, democratic, circle, declared, corrupted, without, singular, authoritarian, overseeing, to, cleanse, the, adjudication, of, maligned, authority, in, 472, or, 471, bc, he, was, ostracised, and, went, into, exile, in, argos, themistocles, thus, fled, from, southern, greece, alexander, i, of, macedon, r, 498, 454, bc, temporarily, gave, him, sanctuary, at, pydna, before, he, traveled, to, asia, minor, where, he, entered, the, service, of, the, persian, king, artaxerxes, i, reigned, 465, 424, bc, he, was, made, governor, of, magnesia, and, lived, there, for, the, rest, of, his, life, themistocles, died, in, 459, bc, probably, of, natural, causes, his, reputation, was, posthumously, rehabilitated, and, he, was, re, established, as, a, hero, of, the, athenian, and, indeed, greek, cause, themistocles, can, still, reasonably, be, thought, of, as, the, man, most, instrumental, in, achieving, the, salvation, of, greece, from, the, persian, threat, as, plutarch, describes, him, his, naval, policies, would, have, a, lasting, impact, on, athens, as, well, since, maritime, power, became, the, cornerstone, of, the, athenian, empire, and, golden, age, thucydides, assessed, themistocles, as, a, man, who, exhibited, the, most, indubitable, signs, of, genius, indeed, in, this, particular, he, has, a, claim, on, our, admiration, quite, extraordinary, and, unparalleled, themistocles, was, born, in, the, attic, deme, of, phrearrhii, around, 524, bc, the, son, of, neocles, a, leontian, also, of, phrearrhii, who, was, in, the, words, of, plutarch, no, very, conspicuous, man, at, athens, his, mother, is, more, obscure, her, name, was, either, euterpe, or, abrotonum, and, her, place, of, origin, has, been, given, variously, as, halicarnassus, thrace, or, acarnania, like, many, contemporaries, little, is, known, of, his, early, years, some, authors, report, that, he, was, unruly, as, a, child, and, was, consequently, disowned, by, his, father, plutarch, considers, this, to, be, false, plutarch, indicates, that, on, account, of, his, mother, s, background, themistocles, was, considered, something, of, an, outsider, furthermore, the, family, appear, to, have, lived, in, an, immigrant, district, of, athens, cynosarges, outside, the, city, walls, however, in, an, early, example, of, his, cunning, themistocles, persuaded, well, born, children, to, exercise, with, him, in, cynosarges, thus, breaking, down, the, distinction, between, alien, and, legitimate, plutarch, further, reports, that, themistocles, was, preoccupied, even, as, a, child, with, preparing, for, public, life, his, teacher, is, said, to, have, told, him, my, boy, you, will, be, nothing, insignificant, but, definitely, something, great, either, for, good, or, evil, themistocles, left, three, sons, by, archippe, the, daughter, of, lysander, of, alopece, archeptolis, polyeuctus, and, cleophantus, plato, s, meno, mentions, cleophantus, as, a, most, excellent, horseman, but, no, equal, to, his, father, in, deeds, or, virtue, and, themistocles, had, two, sons, older, than, these, three, neocles, and, diocles, neocles, died, when, he, was, young, bitten, by, a, horse, and, diocles, was, adopted, by, his, grandfather, lysander, themistocles, had, many, daughters, mnesiptolema, the, product, of, his, second, marriage, married, her, step, brother, archeptolis, and, became, priestess, of, cybele, italia, was, married, to, panthoides, of, chios, and, sybaris, to, nicomedes, the, athenian, after, themistocles, died, his, nephew, phrasicles, went, to, magnesia, and, married, another, daughter, nicomache, with, her, brothers, consent, phrasicles, then, took, charge, of, her, sister, asia, the, youngest, of, all, ten, children, themistocles, grew, up, in, a, period, of, upheaval, in, athens, the, tyrant, peisistratos, had, died, in, 527, bc, passing, power, to, his, sons, hipparchus, and, hippias, hipparchus, was, murdered, in, 514, bc, and, in, response, to, this, hippias, became, paranoid, and, started, to, rely, increasingly, on, foreign, mercenaries, to, keep, a, hold, on, power, the, head, of, the, powerful, but, exiled, alcmaeonid, family, cleisthenes, began, to, scheme, to, overthrow, hippias, and, return, to, athens, in, 510, bc, he, persuaded, the, spartan, king, cleomenes, i, to, launch, a, full, scale, attack, on, athens, which, succeeded, in, overthrowing, hippias, however, in, the, aftermath, the, other, noble, eupatrid, families, of, athens, rejected, cleisthenes, electing, isagoras, as, archon, with, the, support, of, cleomenes, on, a, personal, level, cleisthenes, wanted, to, return, to, athens, however, he, also, probably, wanted, to, prevent, athens, becoming, a, spartan, client, state, outmaneuvering, the, other, nobles, he, proposed, to, the, athenian, people, a, radical, program, in, which, political, power, would, be, invested, in, the, people, a, democracy, the, athenian, people, thus, overthrew, isagoras, repelled, a, spartan, attack, under, cleomenes, and, invited, cleisthenes, to, return, to, athens, and, put, his, plan, into, action, the, establishment, of, the, democracy, was, to, radically, change, athens, and, so, it, was, that, the, athenians, found, themselves, suddenly, a, great, power, they, gave, vivid, proof, of, what, equality, and, freedom, of, speech, might, achieve, the, new, system, of, government, in, athens, opened, up, a, wealth, of, opportunity, for, men, like, themistocles, who, previously, would, have, had, no, access, to, power, moreover, the, new, institutions, of, the, democracy, required, skills, that, had, previously, been, unimportant, in, government, themistocles, was, to, prove, himself, a, master, of, the, new, system, he, could, infight, he, could, network, he, could, spin, and, crucially, he, knew, how, to, make, himself, visible, themistocles, moved, to, the, ceramicus, a, down, market, part, of, athens, this, move, marked, him, out, as, a, man, of, the, people, and, allowed, him, to, interact, more, easily, with, ordinary, citizens, he, began, building, up, a, support, base, among, these, newly, empowered, citizens, he, wooed, the, poor, and, they, not, used, to, being, courted, duly, loved, him, back, touring, the, taverns, the, markets, the, docks, canvassing, where, no, politician, had, thought, to, canvas, before, making, sure, never, to, forget, a, single, voter, s, name, themistocles, had, set, his, eyes, on, a, radical, new, constituency, however, he, took, care, to, ensure, that, he, did, not, alienate, the, nobility, of, athens, he, began, to, practice, law, the, first, person, in, athens, to, prepare, for, public, life, in, this, way, his, ability, as, attorney, and, arbitrator, used, in, the, service, of, the, common, people, gained, him, further, popularity, themistocles, probably, turned, 30, in, 494, bc, which, qualified, him, to, become, an, archon, the, highest, of, the, magistracies, in, athens, on, the, back, of, his, popularity, he, evidently, decided, to, run, for, this, office, and, was, elected, archon, eponymous, the, highest, government, office, in, the, following, year, 493, bc, themistocles, s, archonship, saw, the, beginnings, of, a, major, theme, in, his, career, the, advancement, of, athenian, sea, power, under, his, guidance, the, athenians, began, the, building, of, a, new, port, at, piraeus, to, replace, the, existing, facilities, at, phalerum, although, further, away, from, athens, piraeus, offered, three, natural, harbours, and, could, be, easily, fortified, since, athens, was, to, become, an, essentially, maritime, power, during, the, 5th, century, bc, themistocles, s, policies, were, to, have, huge, significance, for, the, future, of, athens, and, indeed, greece, in, advancing, naval, power, themistocles, was, probably, advocating, a, course, of, action, he, thought, essential, for, the, long, term, prospects, of, athens, however, as, plutarch, implies, since, naval, power, relied, on, the, mass, mobilisation, of, the, common, citizens, thetes, as, rowers, such, a, policy, put, more, power, into, the, hands, of, average, athenians, and, thus, into, themistocles, s, own, hands, after, marathon, probably, in, 489, miltiades, the, hero, of, the, battle, was, seriously, wounded, in, an, abortive, attempt, to, capture, paros, taking, advantage, of, his, incapacitation, the, powerful, alcmaeonid, family, arranged, for, him, to, be, prosecuted, the, athenian, aristocracy, and, indeed, greek, aristocrats, in, general, were, loath, to, see, one, person, pre, eminent, and, such, maneuvers, were, commonplace, miltiades, was, given, a, massive, fine, for, the, crime, of, deceiving, the, athenian, people, but, died, weeks, later, as, a, result, of, his, wound, in, the, wake, of, this, prosecution, the, athenian, people, chose, to, use, a, new, institution, of, the, democracy, which, had, been, part, of, cleisthenes, reforms, but, remained, so, far, unused, this, was, ostracism, each, athenian, citizen, was, required, to, write, on, a, shard, of, pottery, ostrakon, the, name, of, a, politician, that, they, wished, to, see, exiled, for, a, period, of, ten, years, this, may, have, been, triggered, by, miltiades, prosecution, and, used, by, the, athenians, to, try, to, stop, such, power, games, among, the, noble, families, certainly, in, the, years, 487, bc, following, the, heads, of, the, prominent, families, including, the, alcmaeonids, were, exiled, the, career, of, a, politician, in, athens, thus, became, fraught, with, more, difficulty, since, displeasing, the, population, was, likely, to, result, in, exile, themistocles, with, his, power, base, firmly, established, among, the, poor, moved, naturally, to, fill, the, vacuum, left, by, miltiades, death, and, in, that, decade, became, the, most, influential, politician, in, athens, however, the, support, of, the, nobility, began, to, coalesce, around, the, man, who, would, become, themistocles, s, great, rival, aristides, aristides, cast, himself, as, themistocles, s, opposite, virtuous, honest, and, incorruptible, and, his, followers, called, him, the, just, plutarch, suggests, that, according, the, philosopher, ariston, of, ceos, the, rivalry, between, the, two, had, begun, when, they, competed, over, the, love, of, a, boy, they, were, rivals, for, the, affection, of, the, beautiful, stesilaus, of, ceos, and, were, passionate, beyond, all, moderation, during, the, decade, themistocles, continued, to, advocate, the, expansion, of, athenian, naval, power, the, athenians, were, certainly, aware, throughout, this, period, that, the, persian, interest, in, greece, had, not, ended, darius, son, and, successor, xerxes, i, had, continued, the, preparations, for, the, invasion, of, greece, themistocles, seems, to, have, realised, that, for, the, greeks, to, survive, the, coming, onslaught, required, a, greek, navy, that, could, hope, to, face, up, to, the, persian, navy, and, he, therefore, attempted, to, persuade, the, athenians, to, build, such, a, fleet, aristides, as, champion, of, the, zeugites, the, upper, hoplite, class, vigorously, opposed, such, a, policy, in, 483, bc, a, massive, new, seam, of, silver, was, found, in, the, athenian, mines, at, laurium, themistocles, proposed, that, the, silver, should, be, used, to, build, a, new, fleet, of, 200, triremes, while, aristides, suggested, it, should, instead, be, distributed, among, the, athenian, citizens, themistocles, avoided, mentioning, persia, deeming, that, it, was, too, distant, a, threat, for, the, athenians, to, act, on, and, instead, focused, their, attention, on, aegina, at, the, time, athens, was, embroiled, in, a, long, running, war, with, the, aeginetans, and, building, a, fleet, would, allow, the, athenians, to, finally, defeat, them, at, sea, as, a, result, themistocles, s, motion, was, carried, easily, although, only, 100, triremes, were, to, be, built, aristides, refused, to, countenance, this, conversely, themistocles, was, not, pleased, that, only, 100, ships, would, be, built, tension, between, the, two, camps, built, over, the, winter, so, that, the, ostracism, of, 482, bc, became, a, direct, contest, between, themistocles, and, aristides, in, what, has, been, characterized, as, the, first, referendum, aristides, was, ostracised, and, themistocles, s, policies, were, endorsed, indeed, becoming, aware, of, the, persian, preparations, for, the, coming, invasion, the, athenians, voted, for, the, construction, of, more, ships, than, themistocles, had, initially, asked, for, in, the, run, up, to, the, persian, invasion, themistocles, had, thus, become, the, foremost, politician, in, athens, in, 481, bc, a, congress, of, greek, city, states, was, held, during, which, 30, or, so, states, agreed, to, ally, themselves, against, the, forthcoming, invasion, the, spartans, and, athenians, were, foremost, in, this, alliance, being, sworn, enemies, of, the, persians, the, spartans, claimed, the, command, of, land, forces, and, since, the, greek, hereafter, referred, to, as, allied, fleet, would, be, dominated, by, athens, themistocles, tried, to, claim, command, of, the, naval, forces, however, the, other, naval, powers, including, corinth, and, aegina, refused, to, give, command, to, the, athenians, and, themistocles, pragmatically, backed, down, instead, as, a, compromise, the, spartans, an, insignificant, naval, power, in, the, person, of, eurybiades, were, to, command, the, naval, forces, herodotus, is, clear, however, that, themistocles, commanded, the, fleet, in, all, but, name, the, congress, met, again, in, the, spring, of, 480, bc, a, thessalian, delegation, suggested, that, the, allies, could, muster, in, the, narrow, vale, of, tempe, on, the, borders, of, thessaly, and, thereby, block, xerxes, advance, a, force, of, 10, 000, hoplites, was, dispatched, under, the, command, of, the, spartan, polemarch, euenetus, and, themistocles, to, the, vale, of, tempe, which, they, believed, the, persian, army, would, have, to, pass, through, however, once, there, alexander, i, of, macedon, warned, them, that, the, vale, could, be, bypassed, in, several, ways, and, that, the, army, of, xerxes, was, overwhelmingly, large, and, the, greeks, retreated, shortly, afterwards, they, received, the, news, that, xerxes, had, crossed, the, hellespont, themistocles, now, developed, a, second, strategy, the, route, to, southern, greece, boeotia, attica, and, the, peloponnesus, would, require, the, army, of, xerxes, to, travel, through, the, very, narrow, pass, of, thermopylae, this, could, easily, be, blocked, by, the, greek, hoplites, despite, the, overwhelming, numbers, of, persians, furthermore, to, prevent, the, persians, bypassing, thermopylae, by, sea, the, athenian, and, allied, navies, could, block, the, straits, of, artemisium, however, after, the, tempe, debacle, it, was, uncertain, whether, the, spartans, would, be, willing, to, march, out, from, the, peloponnesus, again, to, persuade, the, spartans, to, defend, attica, themistocles, had, to, show, them, that, the, athenians, were, willing, to, do, everything, necessary, for, the, success, of, the, alliance, in, short, the, entire, athenian, fleet, must, be, dispatched, to, artemisium, to, do, this, every, able, bodied, athenian, male, would, be, required, to, man, the, ships, this, in, turn, meant, that, the, athenians, must, prepare, to, abandon, athens, persuading, the, athenians, to, take, this, course, was, one, of, the, highlights, of, themistocles, s, career, as, holland, has, it, what, precise, heights, of, oratory, he, attained, what, stirring, and, memorable, phrases, he, pronounced, we, have, no, way, of, knowing, only, by, the, effect, it, had, on, the, assembly, can, we, gauge, what, surely, must, have, been, its, electric, and, vivifying, quality, for, themistocles, s, audacious, proposals, when, put, to, the, vote, were, ratified, the, athenian, people, facing, the, gravest, moment, of, peril, in, their, history, committed, themselves, once, and, for, all, to, the, alien, element, of, the, sea, and, put, their, faith, in, a, man, whose, ambitions, many, had, long, profoundly, dreaded, his, proposals, accepted, themistocles, issued, orders, for, the, women, and, children, of, athens, to, be, sent, to, the, city, of, troezen, safely, inside, the, peloponnesus, he, was, then, able, to, travel, to, a, meeting, of, the, allies, at, which, he, proposed, his, strategy, with, the, athenian, fleet, fully, committed, to, the, defence, of, greece, the, other, allies, accepted, his, proposals, thus, in, august, 480, bc, when, the, persian, army, was, approaching, thessaly, the, allied, fleet, sailed, to, artemisium, and, the, allied, army, marched, to, thermopylae, themistocles, himself, took, command, of, the, athenian, contingent, of, the, fleet, and, went, to, artemisium, when, the, persian, fleet, finally, arrived, at, artemisium, after, a, significant, delay, eurybiades, who, both, herodotus, and, plutarch, suggest, was, not, the, most, inspiring, commander, wished, to, sail, away, without, fighting, at, this, point, themistocles, accepted, a, large, bribe, from, the, local, people, for, the, fleet, to, remain, at, artemisium, and, he, used, some, of, it, to, bribe, eurybiades, to, remain, while, pocketing, the, rest, from, this, point, on, themistocles, appears, to, have, been, more, or, less, in, charge, of, the, allied, effort, at, artemisium, over, three, days, of, battle, the, allies, held, their, own, against, the, much, larger, persian, fleet, but, sustained, significant, losses, however, the, loss, of, the, simultaneous, battle, of, thermopylae, to, the, persians, made, their, continued, presence, at, artemisium, irrelevant, and, the, allies, thus, evacuated, according, to, herodotus, themistocles, left, messages, at, every, place, where, the, persian, fleet, might, stop, for, drinking, water, asking, the, ionians, in, the, persian, fleet, to, defect, or, at, least, fight, badly, even, if, this, did, not, work, themistocles, apparently, intended, that, xerxes, would, at, least, begin, to, suspect, the, ionians, thereby, sowing, dissension, in, the, persian, ranks, in, the, aftermath, of, thermopylae, boeotia, fell, to, the, persians, who, then, began, to, advance, on, athens, the, peloponnesian, allies, prepared, to, now, defend, the, isthmus, of, corinth, thus, abandoning, athens, to, the, persians, from, artemisium, the, allied, fleet, sailed, to, the, island, of, salamis, where, the, athenian, ships, helped, with, the, final, evacuation, of, athens, the, peloponnesian, contingents, wanted, to, sail, to, the, coast, of, the, isthmus, to, concentrate, forces, with, the, army, however, themistocles, tried, to, convince, them, to, remain, in, the, straits, of, salamis, invoking, the, lessons, of, artemisium, battle, in, close, conditions, works, to, our, advantage, after, threatening, to, sail, with, the, whole, athenian, people, into, exile, in, sicily, he, eventually, persuaded, the, other, allies, whose, security, after, all, relied, on, the, athenian, navy, to, accept, his, plan, therefore, even, after, athens, had, fallen, to, the, persians, and, the, persian, navy, had, arrived, off, the, coast, of, salamis, the, allied, navy, remained, in, the, straits, themistocles, appears, to, have, been, aiming, to, fight, a, battle, that, would, cripple, the, persian, navy, and, thus, guarantee, the, security, of, the, peloponnesus, to, bring, about, this, battle, themistocles, used, a, cunning, mix, of, subterfuge, and, misinformation, psychologically, exploiting, xerxes, desire, to, finish, the, invasion, xerxes, actions, indicate, that, he, was, keen, to, finish, the, conquest, of, greece, in, 480, bc, and, to, do, this, he, needed, a, decisive, victory, over, the, allied, fleet, themistocles, sent, a, servant, sicinnus, to, xerxes, with, a, message, proclaiming, that, themistocles, was, on, the, king, s, side, and, prefers, that, your, affairs, prevail, not, the, hellenes, themistocles, claimed, that, the, allied, commanders, were, infighting, that, the, peloponnesians, were, planning, to, evacuate, that, very, night, and, that, to, gain, victory, all, the, persians, needed, to, do, was, to, block, the, straits, in, performing, this, subterfuge, themistocles, seems, to, have, been, trying, to, lure, the, persian, fleet, into, the, straits, the, message, also, had, a, secondary, purpose, in, the, event, of, an, allied, defeat, the, athenians, might, receive, some, degree, of, mercy, from, xerxes, having, indicated, their, readiness, to, submit, at, any, rate, this, was, exactly, the, kind, of, news, that, xerxes, wanted, to, hear, xerxes, evidently, took, the, bait, and, the, persian, fleet, was, sent, out, to, effect, the, block, perhaps, overconfident, and, expecting, no, resistance, the, persian, navy, sailed, into, the, straits, only, to, find, that, far, from, disintegrating, the, allied, navy, was, ready, for, battle, according, to, herodotus, after, the, persian, navy, began, its, maneuvers, aristides, arrived, at, the, allied, camp, from, aegina, aristides, had, been, recalled, from, exile, along, with, the, other, ostracised, athenians, on, the, order, of, themistocles, so, that, athens, might, be, united, against, the, persians, aristides, told, themistocles, that, the, persian, fleet, had, encircled, the, allies, which, greatly, pleased, themistocles, as, he, now, knew, that, the, persians, had, walked, into, his, trap, the, allied, commanders, seem, to, have, taken, this, news, rather, uncomplainingly, and, holland, therefore, suggests, that, they, were, party, to, themistocles, s, ruse, all, along, either, way, the, allies, prepared, for, battle, and, themistocles, delivered, a, speech, to, the, marines, before, they, embarked, on, the, ships, in, the, ensuing, battle, the, cramped, conditions, in, the, straits, hindered, the, much, larger, persian, navy, which, became, disarrayed, and, the, allies, took, advantage, to, win, a, famous, victory, salamis, was, the, turning, point, in, the, second, persian, invasion, and, indeed, the, greco, persian, wars, in, general, while, the, battle, did, not, end, the, persian, invasion, it, effectively, ensured, that, all, greece, would, not, be, conquered, and, allowed, the, allies, to, go, on, the, offensive, in, 479, bc, a, number, of, historians, believe, that, salamis, is, one, of, the, most, significant, battles, in, human, history, since, themistocles, s, long, standing, advocacy, of, athenian, naval, power, enabled, the, allied, fleet, to, fight, and, his, stratagem, brought, about, the, battle, of, salamis, it, is, probably, not, an, exaggeration, to, say, as, plutarch, does, that, themistocles, is, thought, to, have, been, the, man, most, instrumental, in, achieving, the, salvation, of, hellas, the, allied, victory, at, salamis, ended, the, immediate, threat, to, greece, and, xerxes, now, returned, to, asia, with, part, of, the, army, leaving, his, general, mardonius, to, attempt, to, complete, the, conquest, mardonius, wintered, in, boeotia, and, thessaly, and, the, athenians, were, thus, able, to, return, to, their, city, which, had, been, burnt, and, razed, by, the, persians, for, the, winter, for, the, athenians, and, themistocles, personally, the, winter, would, be, a, testing, one, the, peloponnesians, refused, to, countenance, marching, north, of, the, isthmus, to, fight, the, persian, army, the, athenians, tried, to, shame, them, into, doing, so, with, no, success, during, the, winter, the, allies, held, a, meeting, at, corinth, to, celebrate, their, success, and, award, prizes, for, achievement, however, perhaps, tired, of, the, athenians, pointing, out, their, role, at, salamis, and, of, their, demands, for, the, allies, to, march, north, the, allies, awarded, the, prize, for, civic, achievement, to, aegina, furthermore, although, the, admirals, all, voted, for, themistocles, in, second, place, they, all, voted, for, themselves, in, first, place, so, that, no, one, won, the, prize, for, individual, achievement, in, response, realising, the, importance, of, the, athenian, fleet, to, their, security, and, probably, seeking, to, massage, themistocles, s, ego, the, spartans, brought, themistocles, to, sparta, there, he, was, awarded, a, special, prize, for, his, wisdom, and, cleverness, and, won, high, praise, from, all, furthermore, plutarch, reports, that, at, the, next, olympic, games, themistocles, entered, the, stadium, the, audience, neglected, the, contestants, all, day, long, to, gaze, on, him, and, pointed, him, out, with, admiring, applause, to, visiting, strangers, so, that, he, too, was, delighted, and, confessed, to, his, friends, that, he, was, now, reaping, in, full, measure, the, harvest, of, his, toils, in, behalf, of, hellas, after, returning, to, athens, in, the, winter, plutarch, reports, that, themistocles, made, a, proposal, to, the, city, while, the, greek, fleet, was, wintering, at, pagasae, themistocles, once, declared, to, the, people, that, he, had, devised, a, certain, measure, which, could, not, be, revealed, to, them, though, it, would, be, helpful, and, salutary, for, the, city, and, they, ordered, that, aristides, alone, should, hear, what, it, was, and, pass, judgment, on, it, so, themistocles, told, aristides, that, his, purpose, was, to, burn, the, naval, station, of, the, confederate, hellenes, for, that, in, this, way, the, athenians, would, be, greatest, and, lords, of, all, then, aristides, came, before, the, people, and, said, of, the, deed, which, themistocles, purposed, to, do, that, none, other, could, be, more, advantageous, and, none, more, unjust, on, hearing, this, the, athenians, ordained, that, themistocles, cease, from, his, purpose, however, as, happened, to, many, prominent, individuals, in, the, athenian, democracy, themistocles, s, fellow, citizens, grew, jealous, of, his, success, and, possibly, tired, of, his, boasting, it, is, probable, that, in, early, 479, bc, themistocles, was, stripped, of, his, command, instead, xanthippus, was, to, command, the, athenian, fleet, and, aristides, the, land, forces, though, themistocles, was, no, doubt, politically, and, militarily, active, for, the, rest, of, the, campaign, no, mention, of, his, activities, in, 479, bc, is, made, in, the, ancient, sources, in, the, summer, of, that, year, after, receiving, an, athenian, ultimatum, the, peloponnesians, finally, agreed, to, assemble, an, army, and, march, to, confront, mardonius, who, had, reoccupied, athens, in, june, at, the, decisive, battle, of, plataea, the, allies, destroyed, the, persian, army, while, apparently, on, the, same, day, the, allied, navy, destroyed, the, remnants, of, the, persian, fleet, at, the, battle, of, mycale, these, twin, victories, completed, the, allied, triumph, and, ended, the, persian, threat, to, greece, whatever, the, cause, of, themistocles, s, unpopularity, in, 479, bc, it, obviously, did, not, last, long, both, diodorus, and, plutarch, suggest, he, was, quickly, restored, to, the, favour, of, the, athenians, indeed, after, 479, bc, he, seems, to, have, enjoyed, a, relatively, long, period, of, popularity, in, the, aftermath, of, the, invasion, and, the, destruction, of, athens, by, the, achaemenids, the, athenians, began, rebuilding, their, city, under, the, guidance, of, themistocles, in, the, autumn, of, 479, bc, they, wished, to, restore, the, fortifications, of, athens, but, the, spartans, objected, on, the, grounds, that, no, place, north, of, the, isthmus, should, be, left, that, the, persians, could, use, as, a, fortress, themistocles, urged, the, citizens, to, build, the, fortifications, as, quickly, as, possible, then, went, to, sparta, as, an, ambassador, to, answer, the, charges, levelled, by, the, spartans, there, he, assured, them, that, no, building, work, was, on, going, and, urged, them, to, send, emissaries, to, athens, to, see, for, themselves, by, the, time, the, ambassadors, arrived, the, athenians, had, finished, building, and, then, detained, the, spartan, ambassadors, when, they, complained, about, the, presence, of, the, fortifications, by, delaying, in, this, manner, themistocles, gave, the, athenians, enough, time, to, fortify, the, city, and, thus, ward, off, any, spartan, attack, aimed, at, preventing, the, re, fortification, of, athens, furthermore, the, spartans, were, obliged, to, repatriate, themistocles, in, order, to, free, their, own, ambassadors, however, this, episode, may, be, seen, as, the, beginning, of, the, spartan, mistrust, of, themistocles, which, would, return, to, haunt, him, themistocles, also, now, returned, to, his, naval, policy, and, more, ambitious, undertakings, that, would, increase, the, dominant, position, of, his, native, state, he, further, extended, and, fortified, the, port, complex, at, piraeus, and, fastened, the, city, to, the, piraeus, and, the, land, to, the, sea, themistocles, probably, aimed, to, make, athens, the, dominant, naval, power, in, the, aegean, indeed, athens, would, create, the, delian, league, in, 478, bc, uniting, the, naval, power, of, the, aegean, islands, and, ionia, under, athenian, leadership, themistocles, introduced, tax, breaks, for, merchants, and, artisans, to, attract, both, people, and, trade, to, the, city, to, make, athens, a, great, mercantile, centre, he, also, instructed, the, athenians, to, build, 20, triremes, per, year, to, ensure, that, their, dominance, in, naval, matters, continued, plutarch, reports, that, themistocles, also, secretly, proposed, to, destroy, the, beached, ships, of, the, other, allied, navies, to, ensure, complete, naval, dominance, but, was, overruled, by, aristides, and, the, council, of, athens, it, seems, clear, that, towards, the, end, of, the, decade, themistocles, had, begun, to, accrue, enemies, and, had, become, arrogant, moreover, his, fellow, citizens, had, become, jealous, of, his, prestige, and, power, the, rhodian, poet, timocreon, was, among, his, most, eloquent, enemies, composing, slanderous, drinking, songs, meanwhile, the, spartans, actively, worked, against, him, trying, to, promote, cimon, son, of, miltiades, as, a, rival, to, themistocles, furthermore, after, the, treason, and, disgrace, of, the, spartan, general, pausanias, the, spartans, tried, to, implicate, themistocles, in, the, plot, he, was, however, acquitted, of, these, charges, in, athens, itself, he, lost, favour, by, building, a, sanctuary, of, artemis, with, the, epithet, aristoboul, of, good, counsel, near, his, home, a, blatant, reference, to, his, own, role, in, delivering, greece, from, the, persian, invasion, eventually, in, either, 472, or, 471, bc, he, was, ostracised, in, itself, this, did, not, mean, that, themistocles, had, done, anything, wrong, ostracism, in, the, words, of, plutarch, was, not, a, penalty, but, a, way, of, pacifying, and, alleviating, that, jealousy, which, delights, to, humble, the, eminent, breathing, out, its, malice, into, this, disfranchisement, themistocles, first, went, to, live, in, exile, in, argos, however, perceiving, that, they, now, had, a, prime, opportunity, to, bring, themistocles, down, for, good, the, spartans, again, levelled, accusations, of, themistocles, s, complicity, in, pausanias, s, treason, they, demanded, that, he, be, tried, by, the, congress, of, greeks, rather, than, in, athens, although, it, seems, that, in, the, end, he, was, actually, summoned, to, athens, to, stand, trial, perhaps, realising, he, had, little, hope, of, surviving, this, trial, themistocles, fled, first, to, kerkyra, and, thence, to, admetus, king, of, molossia, themistocles, s, flight, probably, only, served, to, convince, his, accusers, of, his, guilt, and, he, was, declared, a, traitor, in, athens, his, property, to, be, confiscated, both, diodorus, and, plutarch, considered, that, the, charges, were, false, and, made, solely, for, the, purposes, of, destroying, themistocles, the, spartans, sent, ambassadors, to, admetus, threatening, that, the, whole, of, greece, would, go, to, war, with, the, molossians, unless, they, surrendered, themistocles, admetus, however, allowed, themistocles, to, escape, giving, him, a, large, sum, of, gold, to, aid, him, on, his, way, themistocles, then, fled, from, greece, apparently, never, to, return, thus, effectively, bringing, his, political, career, to, an, end, from, molossia, themistocles, apparently, fled, to, pydna, from, where, he, took, a, ship, for, asia, minor, this, ship, was, blown, off, course, by, a, storm, and, ended, up, at, naxos, which, an, athenian, fleet, was, in, the, process, of, besieging, desperate, to, avoid, the, legal, authorities, themistocles, who, had, been, traveling, under, an, assumed, identity, revealed, himself, to, the, captain, and, said, that, if, he, did, not, reach, safety, he, would, tell, the, athenians, that, he, d, bribed, the, ship, to, take, him, according, to, thucydides, who, wrote, within, living, memory, of, the, events, the, ship, eventually, landed, safely, at, ephesus, where, themistocles, disembarked, plutarch, has, the, ship, docking, at, cyme, in, aeolia, and, diodorus, has, themistocles, making, his, way, to, asia, in, an, undefined, manner, diodorus, and, plutarch, next, recount, a, similar, tale, namely, that, themistocles, stayed, briefly, with, an, acquaintance, lysitheides, or, nicogenes, who, was, also, acquainted, with, the, persian, king, artaxerxes, i, since, there, was, a, bounty, on, themistocles, s, head, this, acquaintance, devised, a, plan, to, safely, convey, themistocles, to, the, persian, king, in, the, type, of, covered, wagon, that, the, king, s, concubines, travelled, in, all, three, chroniclers, agree, that, themistocles, s, next, move, was, to, contact, the, persian, king, in, thucydides, this, is, by, letter, while, plutarch, and, diodorus, have, a, face, to, face, meeting, with, the, king, the, spirit, is, however, the, same, in, all, three, themistocles, introduces, himself, to, the, king, and, seeks, to, enter, his, service, i, themistocles, am, come, to, you, who, did, your, house, more, harm, than, any, of, the, hellenes, when, i, was, compelled, to, defend, myself, against, your, father, s, invasion, harm, however, far, surpassed, by, the, good, that, i, did, him, during, his, retreat, which, brought, no, danger, for, me, but, much, for, him, thucydides, thucydides, and, plutarch, say, that, themistocles, asked, for, a, year, s, grace, to, learn, the, persian, language, and, customs, after, which, he, would, serve, the, king, and, artaxerxes, granted, this, plutarch, reports, that, as, might, be, imagined, artaxerxes, was, elated, that, such, a, dangerous, and, illustrious, foe, had, come, to, serve, him, at, some, point, in, his, travels, themistocles, s, wife, and, children, were, extricated, from, athens, by, a, friend, and, joined, him, in, exile, his, friends, also, managed, to, send, him, many, of, his, belongings, although, up, to, 100, talents, worth, of, his, goods, were, confiscated, by, the, athenians, when, after, a, year, themistocles, returned, to, the, king, s, court, he, appears, to, have, made, an, immediate, impact, and, he, attained, very, high, consideration, there, such, as, no, hellene, has, ever, possessed, before, or, since, plutarch, recounts, that, honors, he, enjoyed, were, far, beyond, those, paid, to, other, foreigners, nay, he, actually, took, part, in, the, king, s, hunts, and, in, his, household, diversions, themistocles, advised, the, king, on, his, dealings, with, the, greeks, although, it, seems, that, for, a, long, period, the, king, was, distracted, by, events, elsewhere, in, the, empire, and, thus, themistocles, lived, on, for, a, long, time, without, concern, he, was, made, governor, of, the, district, of, magnesia, on, the, maeander, river, in, asia, minor, and, assigned, the, revenues, of, three, cities, magnesia, about, 50, talents, per, year, for, bread, myus, for, opson, and, lampsacus, for, wine, according, to, plutarch, neanthes, of, cyzicus, and, phanias, reported, two, more, the, city, of, palaescepsis, for, clothes, and, the, city, of, percote, for, bedding, and, furniture, for, his, house, both, near, lampsacus, themistocles, was, one, of, the, several, greek, aristocrats, who, took, refuge, in, the, achaemenid, empire, following, reversals, at, home, other, famous, ones, being, hippias, demaratos, gongylos, or, later, alcibiades, in, general, those, were, generously, welcomed, by, the, achaemenid, kings, and, received, land, grants, to, support, them, and, ruled, on, various, cities, of, asia, minor, conversely, some, achaemenid, satraps, were, welcomed, as, exiles, in, western, courts, such, as, artabazos, ii, coins, are, the, only, contemporary, documents, remaining, from, the, time, of, themistocles, although, many, of, the, first, coins, of, antiquity, illustrated, the, images, of, various, gods, or, symbols, the, first, portraiture, of, actual, rulers, only, appears, in, the, 5th, century, bc, themistocles, was, probably, the, first, ruler, ever, to, issue, coinage, with, his, personal, portrait, as, he, became, achaemenid, governor, of, magnesia, in, 465, 459, bc, themistocles, may, have, been, in, a, unique, position, in, which, he, could, transfer, the, notion, of, individual, portraiture, already, current, in, the, greek, world, and, at, the, same, time, wield, the, dynastic, power, of, an, achaemenid, dynast, who, could, issue, his, own, coins, and, illustrate, them, as, he, wished, still, there, is, some, doubt, that, his, coins, may, have, represented, zeus, rather, than, himself, during, his, lifetime, themistocles, is, known, to, have, erected, two, statues, to, himself, one, in, athens, and, the, other, in, magnesia, which, would, lend, credence, to, the, possibility, that, he, also, illustrated, himself, on, his, coins, the, themistocles, statue, in, magnesia, was, illustrated, on, the, reverse, of, some, of, the, magnesian, coins, of, roman, emperor, antoninus, pius, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, the, rulers, of, lycia, followed, towards, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, as, the, most, prolific, and, unambiguous, producers, of, coins, displaying, the, portrait, of, their, rulers, from, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, portraiture, of, the, issuing, ruler, would, then, become, a, standard, generalized, feature, of, coinage, themistocles, died, at, magnesia, in, 459, bc, at, the, age, of, 65, according, to, thucydides, from, natural, causes, however, perhaps, inevitably, there, were, also, rumours, surrounding, his, death, saying, that, unwilling, to, follow, the, great, king, s, order, to, make, war, on, athens, he, committed, suicide, by, taking, poison, or, drinking, bull, s, blood, plutarch, provides, the, most, evocative, version, of, this, story, but, when, egypt, revolted, with, athenian, aid, and, cimon, s, mastery, of, the, sea, forced, the, king, to, resist, the, efforts, of, the, hellenes, and, to, hinder, their, hostile, growth, messages, came, down, to, themistocles, saying, that, the, king, commanded, him, to, make, good, his, promises, by, applying, himself, to, the, hellenic, problem, then, neither, embittered, by, anything, like, anger, against, his, former, fellow, citizens, nor, lifted, up, by, the, great, honor, and, power, he, was, to, have, in, the, war, but, possibly, thinking, his, task, not, even, approachable, both, because, hellas, had, other, great, generals, at, the, time, and, especially, because, cimon, was, so, marvelously, successful, in, his, campaigns, yet, most, of, all, out, of, regard, for, the, reputation, of, his, own, achievements, and, the, trophies, of, those, early, days, having, decided, that, his, best, course, was, to, put, a, fitting, end, to, his, life, he, made, a, sacrifice, to, the, gods, then, called, his, friends, together, gave, them, a, farewell, clasp, of, his, hand, and, as, the, current, story, goes, drank, bull, s, blood, or, as, some, say, took, a, quick, poison, and, so, died, in, magnesia, in, the, sixty, fifth, year, of, his, life, they, say, that, the, king, on, learning, the, cause, and, the, manner, of, his, death, admired, the, man, yet, more, and, continued, to, treat, his, friends, and, kindred, with, kindness, it, was, rumored, that, after, his, death, themistocles, s, bones, were, transported, to, attica, in, accordance, with, his, wishes, and, buried, in, his, native, soil, in, secret, it, being, illegal, to, bury, an, athenian, traitor, in, attica, the, magnesians, built, a, splendid, tomb, in, their, marketplace, for, themistocles, which, still, stood, during, the, time, of, plutarch, and, continued, to, dedicate, part, of, their, revenues, to, the, family, of, themistocles, nepos, in, the, 1st, century, bc, wrote, about, a, statue, of, themistocles, visible, in, the, forum, of, magnesia, the, statue, also, appears, on, a, coin, type, of, roman, emperor, antoninus, pius, minted, in, magnesia, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, archeptolis, son, of, themistocles, became, a, governor, of, magnesia, after, his, father, s, death, c, 459, bce, archeptolis, also, minted, his, own, silver, coinage, as, he, ruled, magnesia, and, it, is, probable, that, part, of, his, revenues, continued, to, be, handed, over, to, the, achaemenids, in, exchange, for, the, maintenance, of, their, territorial, grant, themistocles, and, his, son, formed, what, some, authors, have, called, a, greek, dynasty, in, the, persian, empire, from, a, second, wife, themistocles, also, had, a, daughter, named, mnesiptolema, whom, he, appointed, as, priestess, of, the, temple, of, dindymene, in, magnesia, with, the, title, of, mother, of, the, gods, mnesiptolema, would, eventually, marry, her, half, brother, archeptolis, homopatric, but, not, homometric, marriages, being, permitted, in, athens, themistocles, also, had, several, other, daughters, named, nicomache, asia, italia, sybaris, and, probably, hellas, who, married, the, greek, exile, in, persia, gongylos, and, still, had, a, fief, in, persian, anatolia, in, 400, 399, bc, as, his, widow, themistocles, also, had, three, other, sons, diocles, polyeucteus, and, cleophantus, the, latter, possibly, a, ruler, of, lampsacus, one, of, the, descendants, of, cleophantus, still, issued, a, decree, in, lampsacus, around, 200, bc, mentioning, a, feast, for, his, own, father, also, named, themistocles, who, had, greatly, benefited, the, city, later, pausanias, wrote, that, the, sons, of, themistocles, appear, to, have, returned, to, athens, and, that, they, dedicated, a, painting, of, themistocles, in, the, parthenon, and, erected, a, bronze, statue, to, artemis, leucophryene, the, goddess, of, magnesia, on, the, acropolis, they, may, have, returned, from, asia, minor, in, old, age, after, 412, bc, when, the, achaemenids, took, again, firm, control, of, the, greek, cities, of, asia, and, they, may, have, been, expelled, by, the, achaemenid, satrap, tissaphernes, sometime, between, 412, and, 399, bc, in, effect, from, 414, bc, darius, ii, had, started, to, resent, increasing, athenian, power, in, the, aegean, and, had, tissaphernes, enter, into, an, alliance, with, sparta, against, athens, which, in, 412, bc, led, to, the, persian, conquest, of, the, greater, part, of, ionia, plutarch, in, the, 1st, century, ad, indicates, that, he, met, in, athens, a, lineal, descendant, of, themistocles, also, called, themistocles, who, was, still, being, paid, revenues, from, asia, minor, 600, years, after, the, events, in, question, it, is, possible, to, draw, some, conclusions, about, themistocles, s, character, perhaps, his, most, evident, trait, was, his, massive, ambition, in, his, ambition, he, surpassed, all, men, he, hankered, after, public, office, rather, as, a, man, in, delirium, might, crave, a, cure, he, was, proud, and, vain, and, anxious, for, recognition, of, his, deeds, his, relationship, with, power, was, of, a, particularly, personal, nature, while, he, undoubtedly, desired, the, best, for, athens, many, of, his, actions, also, seem, to, have, been, made, in, self, interest, he, also, appears, to, have, been, corrupt, at, least, by, modern, standards, and, was, known, for, his, fondness, of, bribes, yet, set, against, these, negative, traits, was, an, apparently, natural, brilliance, and, talent, for, leadership, both, herodotus, and, plato, record, variations, of, an, anecdote, in, which, themistocles, responded, with, subtle, sarcasm, to, an, undistinguished, man, who, complained, that, the, great, politician, owed, his, fame, merely, to, the, fact, that, he, came, from, athens, as, herodotus, tells, it, as, plato, tells, it, the, heckler, hails, from, the, small, island, of, seriphus, themistocles, retorts, that, it, is, true, that, he, would, not, have, been, famous, if, he, had, come, from, that, small, island, but, that, the, heckler, would, not, have, been, famous, either, if, he, had, been, born, in, athens, themistocles, was, undoubtedly, intelligent, but, also, possessed, natural, cunning, the, workings, of, his, mind, infinitely, mobile, and, serpentine, themistocles, was, evidently, sociable, and, appears, to, have, enjoyed, strong, personal, loyalty, from, his, friends, at, any, rate, it, seems, to, have, been, themistocles, s, particular, mix, of, virtues, and, vices, that, made, him, such, an, effective, politician, themistocles, died, with, his, reputation, in, tatters, a, traitor, to, the, athenian, people, the, saviour, of, greece, had, turned, into, the, enemy, of, liberty, however, his, reputation, in, athens, was, rehabilitated, by, pericles, in, the, 450s, bc, and, by, the, time, herodotus, wrote, his, history, themistocles, was, once, again, seen, as, a, hero, thucydides, evidently, held, themistocles, in, some, esteem, and, is, uncharacteristically, flattering, in, his, praise, for, him, see, above, diodorus, also, extensively, praises, themistocles, going, as, far, as, to, offer, a, rationale, for, the, length, at, which, he, discusses, him, now, on, the, subject, of, the, high, merits, of, themistocles, even, if, we, have, dwelt, over, long, on, the, subject, in, this, digression, we, believed, it, not, seemly, that, we, should, leave, his, great, ability, unrecorded, indeed, diodorus, whose, history, includes, alexander, the, great, and, hannibal, goes, so, far, as, to, say, that, but, if, any, man, putting, envy, aside, will, estimate, closely, not, only, the, man, s, natural, gifts, but, also, his, achievements, he, will, find, that, on, both, counts, themistocles, holds, first, place, among, all, of, whom, we, have, record, therefore, one, may, well, be, amazed, that, the, athenians, were, willing, to, rid, themselves, of, a, man, of, such, genius, plutarch, offers, a, more, nuanced, view, of, themistocles, with, more,
