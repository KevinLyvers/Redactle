edwin, powell, hubble, november, 20, 1889, september, 28, 1953, was, an, american, astronomer, he, played, a, crucial, role, in, establishing, the, fields, of, extragalactic, astronomy, and, observational, cosmology, hubble, proved, that, many, objects, previously, thought, to, be, clouds, of, dust, and, gas, and, classified, as, nebulae, were, actually, galaxies, beyond, the, milky, way, he, used, the, strong, direct, relationship, between, a, classical, cepheid, variable, s, luminosity, and, pulsation, period, discovered, in, 1908, by, henrietta, swan, leavitt, for, scaling, galactic, and, extragalactic, distances, hubble, confirmed, in, 1929, that, the, recessional, velocity, of, a, galaxy, increases, with, its, distance, from, earth, a, behavior, that, became, known, as, hubble, s, law, although, it, had, been, proposed, two, years, earlier, by, georges, lema, tre, the, hubble, law, implies, that, the, universe, is, expanding, a, decade, before, the, american, astronomer, vesto, slipher, had, provided, the, first, evidence, that, the, light, from, many, of, these, nebulae, was, strongly, red, shifted, indicative, of, high, recession, velocities, hubble, s, name, is, most, widely, recognized, for, the, hubble, space, telescope, which, was, named, in, his, honor, with, a, model, prominently, displayed, in, his, hometown, of, marshfield, missouri, edwin, hubble, was, born, in, 1889, to, virginia, lee, hubble, n, e, james, 1864, 1934, and, john, powell, hubble, an, insurance, executive, in, marshfield, missouri, and, moved, to, wheaton, illinois, in, 1900, in, his, younger, days, he, was, noted, more, for, his, athletic, prowess, than, his, intellectual, abilities, although, he, did, earn, good, grades, in, every, subject, except, spelling, edwin, was, a, gifted, athlete, playing, baseball, football, and, running, track, in, both, high, school, and, college, he, won, seven, first, places, and, a, third, place, in, a, single, high, school, track, and, field, meet, in, 1906, and, he, played, a, variety, of, positions, on, the, basketball, court, from, center, to, shooting, guard, hubble, led, the, university, of, chicago, s, basketball, team, to, their, first, big, ten, conference, title, in, 1907, hubble, s, studies, at, the, university, of, chicago, were, concentrated, on, mathematics, astronomy, and, philosophy, which, resulted, in, a, bachelor, of, science, degree, by, 1910, for, a, year, he, was, also, a, student, laboratory, assistant, for, the, physicist, robert, millikan, a, future, nobel, prize, winner, hubble, also, became, a, member, of, the, kappa, sigma, fraternity, a, rhodes, scholar, he, spent, three, years, at, the, queen, s, college, oxford, studying, jurisprudence, instead, of, science, as, a, promise, to, his, dying, father, and, later, added, studies, in, literature, and, spanish, eventually, earning, his, master, s, degree, in, 1909, hubble, s, father, moved, his, family, from, chicago, to, shelbyville, kentucky, so, that, the, family, could, live, in, a, small, town, ultimately, settling, in, nearby, louisville, his, father, died, in, the, winter, of, 1913, while, edwin, was, still, in, england, in, the, following, summer, edwin, returned, home, to, care, for, his, mother, two, sisters, and, younger, brother, along, with, his, brother, william, the, family, moved, once, more, to, everett, avenue, in, louisville, s, highlands, neighborhood, to, accommodate, edwin, and, william, hubble, was, a, dutiful, son, who, despite, his, intense, interest, in, astronomy, since, boyhood, acquiesced, to, his, father, s, request, to, study, law, first, at, the, university, of, chicago, and, later, at, oxford, in, this, time, he, also, took, some, math, and, science, courses, after, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1913, edwin, returned, to, the, midwest, from, oxford, but, did, not, have, the, motivation, to, practice, law, instead, he, proceeded, to, teach, spanish, physics, and, mathematics, at, new, albany, high, school, in, new, albany, indiana, where, he, also, coached, the, boys, basketball, team, after, a, year, of, high, school, teaching, he, entered, graduate, school, with, the, help, of, his, former, professor, from, the, university, of, chicago, to, study, astronomy, at, the, university, s, yerkes, observatory, where, he, received, his, ph, d, in, 1921, his, dissertation, was, titled, photographic, investigations, of, faint, nebulae, at, yerkes, he, had, access, to, its, 40, inch, refractor, built, in, 1897, as, well, as, an, innovative, 26, inch, 61, cm, reflector, after, the, united, states, declared, war, on, germany, in, 1917, during, world, war, i, hubble, rushed, to, complete, his, ph, d, dissertation, so, he, could, join, the, military, hubble, volunteered, for, the, united, states, army, and, was, assigned, to, the, newly, created, 86th, division, where, he, served, in, the, 2nd, battalion, 343rd, infantry, regiment, he, rose, to, the, rank, of, major, and, was, found, fit, for, overseas, duty, on, july, 9, 1918, the, 86th, division, moved, overseas, but, never, saw, combat, as, it, was, broken, up, and, its, personnel, used, as, replacements, in, other, units, after, the, end, of, world, war, i, hubble, spent, a, year, at, cambridge, university, where, he, renewed, his, studies, of, astronomy, in, 1919, hubble, was, offered, a, staff, position, at, the, carnegie, institution, for, science, s, mount, wilson, observatory, near, pasadena, california, by, george, ellery, hale, the, founder, and, director, of, the, observatory, hubble, remained, on, staff, at, mount, wilson, until, his, death, in, 1953, shortly, before, his, death, hubble, became, the, first, astronomer, to, use, the, newly, completed, giant, 200, inch, 5, 1, m, reflector, hale, telescope, at, the, palomar, observatory, near, san, diego, california, hubble, also, worked, as, a, civilian, for, u, s, army, at, aberdeen, proving, ground, in, maryland, during, world, war, ii, as, the, chief, of, the, external, ballistics, branch, of, the, ballistics, research, laboratory, during, which, he, directed, a, large, volume, of, research, in, exterior, ballistics, which, increased, the, effective, firepower, of, bombs, and, projectiles, his, work, was, facilitated, by, his, personal, development, of, several, items, of, equipment, for, the, instrumentation, used, in, exterior, ballistics, the, most, outstanding, development, being, the, high, speed, clock, camera, which, made, possible, the, study, of, the, characteristics, of, bombs, and, low, velocity, projectiles, in, flight, the, results, of, his, studies, were, credited, with, greatly, improving, design, performance, and, military, effectiveness, of, bombs, and, rockets, for, his, work, there, he, received, the, legion, of, merit, award, edwin, hubble, s, arrival, at, mount, wilson, observatory, california, in, 1919, coincided, roughly, with, the, completion, of, the, 100, inch, 2, 5, m, hooker, telescope, then, the, world, s, largest, at, that, time, the, prevailing, view, of, the, cosmos, was, that, the, universe, consisted, entirely, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, using, the, hooker, telescope, at, mount, wilson, hubble, identified, cepheid, variables, a, standard, candle, discovered, by, henrietta, leavitt, comparing, their, apparent, luminosity, to, their, intrinsic, luminosity, gives, their, distance, from, earth, hubble, found, cepheids, in, several, nebulae, including, the, andromeda, nebula, and, triangulum, nebula, his, observations, made, in, 1924, proved, conclusively, that, these, nebulae, were, much, too, distant, to, be, part, of, the, milky, way, and, were, in, fact, entire, galaxies, outside, our, own, thus, today, they, are, no, longer, considered, nebulae, this, was, first, hypothesized, as, early, as, 1755, when, immanuel, kant, s, general, history, of, nature, and, theory, of, the, heavens, appeared, hubble, s, hypothesis, was, opposed, by, many, in, the, astronomy, establishment, of, the, time, in, particular, by, harvard, university, based, harlow, shapley, despite, the, opposition, hubble, then, a, thirty, five, year, old, scientist, had, his, findings, first, published, in, the, new, york, times, on, november, 23, 1924, then, presented, them, to, other, astronomers, at, the, january, 1, 1925, meeting, of, the, american, astronomical, society, hubble, s, results, for, andromeda, were, not, formally, published, in, a, peer, reviewed, scientific, journal, until, 1929, hubble, s, findings, fundamentally, changed, the, scientific, view, of, the, universe, supporters, state, that, hubble, s, discovery, of, nebulae, outside, of, our, galaxy, helped, pave, the, way, for, future, astronomers, although, some, of, his, more, renowned, colleagues, simply, scoffed, at, his, results, hubble, ended, up, publishing, his, findings, on, nebulae, this, published, work, earned, him, an, award, titled, the, american, association, prize, and, five, hundred, dollars, from, burton, e, livingston, of, the, committee, on, awards, hubble, also, devised, the, most, commonly, used, system, for, classifying, galaxies, grouping, them, according, to, their, appearance, in, photographic, images, he, arranged, the, different, groups, of, galaxies, in, what, became, known, as, the, hubble, sequence, hubble, went, on, to, estimate, the, distances, to, 24, extra, galactic, nebulae, using, a, variety, of, methods, in, 1929, hubble, examined, the, relationship, between, these, distances, and, their, radial, velocities, as, determined, from, their, redshifts, all, of, his, estimated, distances, are, now, known, to, be, too, small, by, up, to, a, factor, of, about, 7, this, was, due, to, factors, such, as, the, fact, that, there, are, two, kinds, of, cepheid, variables, or, confusing, bright, gas, clouds, with, bright, stars, however, his, distances, were, more, or, less, proportional, to, the, true, distances, and, combining, his, distances, with, measurements, of, the, redshifts, of, the, galaxies, by, vesto, slipher, and, by, his, assistant, milton, l, humason, he, found, a, roughly, linear, relationship, between, the, distances, of, the, galaxies, and, their, radial, velocities, corrected, for, solar, motion, a, discovery, that, later, became, known, as, hubble, s, law, this, meant, that, the, greater, the, distance, between, any, two, galaxies, the, greater, their, relative, speed, of, separation, if, interpreted, that, way, hubble, s, measurements, on, 46, galaxies, lead, to, a, value, for, the, hubble, constant, of, 500, km, s, mpc, which, is, much, higher, than, the, currently, accepted, values, of, 74, km, s, mpc, cosmic, distance, ladder, method, or, 68, km, s, mpc, cmb, method, due, to, errors, in, their, distance, calibrations, yet, the, reason, for, the, redshift, remained, unclear, georges, lema, tre, predicted, on, theoretical, grounds, based, on, einstein, s, equations, for, general, relativity, the, redshift, distance, relation, and, published, observational, support, for, it, two, years, before, the, discovery, of, hubble, s, law, although, he, used, the, term, velocities, in, his, paper, and, apparent, radial, velocities, in, the, introduction, he, later, expressed, doubt, about, interpreting, these, as, real, velocities, in, 1931, he, wrote, a, letter, to, the, dutch, cosmologist, willem, de, sitter, expressing, his, opinion, on, the, theoretical, interpretation, of, the, redshift, distance, relation, mr, humason, and, i, are, both, deeply, sensible, of, your, gracious, appreciation, of, the, papers, on, velocities, and, distances, of, nebulae, we, use, the, term, apparent, velocities, to, emphasize, the, empirical, features, of, the, correlation, the, interpretation, we, feel, should, be, left, to, you, and, the, very, few, others, who, are, competent, to, discuss, the, matter, with, authority, today, the, apparent, velocities, in, question, are, usually, thought, of, as, an, increase, in, proper, distance, that, occurs, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, universe, light, traveling, through, an, expanding, metric, will, experience, a, hubble, type, redshift, a, mechanism, somewhat, different, from, the, doppler, effect, although, the, two, mechanisms, become, equivalent, descriptions, related, by, a, coordinate, transformation, for, nearby, galaxies, in, the, 1930s, hubble, was, involved, in, determining, the, distribution, of, galaxies, and, spatial, curvature, these, data, seemed, to, indicate, that, the, universe, was, flat, and, homogeneous, but, there, was, a, deviation, from, flatness, at, large, redshifts, according, to, allan, sandage, hubble, believed, that, his, count, data, gave, a, more, reasonable, result, concerning, spatial, curvature, if, the, redshift, correction, was, made, assuming, no, recession, to, the, very, end, of, his, writings, he, maintained, this, position, favouring, or, at, the, very, least, keeping, open, the, model, where, no, true, expansion, exists, and, therefore, that, the, redshift, represents, a, hitherto, unrecognized, principle, of, nature, there, were, methodological, problems, with, hubble, s, survey, technique, that, showed, a, deviation, from, flatness, at, large, redshifts, in, particular, the, technique, did, not, account, for, changes, in, luminosity, of, galaxies, due, to, galaxy, evolution, earlier, in, 1917, albert, einstein, had, found, that, his, newly, developed, theory, of, general, relativity, indicated, that, the, universe, must, be, either, expanding, or, contracting, unable, to, believe, what, his, own, equations, were, telling, him, einstein, introduced, a, cosmological, constant, a, fudge, factor, to, the, equations, to, avoid, this, problem, when, einstein, learned, of, hubble, s, redshifts, he, immediately, realized, that, the, expansion, predicted, by, general, relativity, must, be, real, and, in, later, life, he, said, that, changing, his, equations, was, the, biggest, blunder, of, life, in, fact, einstein, apparently, once, visited, hubble, and, tried, to, convince, him, that, the, universe, was, expanding, hubble, also, discovered, the, asteroid, 1373, cincinnati, on, august, 30, 1935, in, 1936, he, wrote, the, observational, approach, to, cosmology, and, the, realm, of, the, nebulae, which, explained, his, approaches, to, extra, galactic, astronomy, and, his, view, of, the, subject, s, history, in, december, 1941, hubble, reported, to, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, that, results, from, a, six, year, survey, with, the, mt, wilson, telescope, did, not, support, the, expanding, universe, theory, according, to, a, los, angeles, times, article, reporting, on, hubble, s, remarks, the, nebulae, could, not, be, uniformly, distributed, as, the, telescope, shows, they, are, and, still, fit, the, explosion, idea, explanations, which, try, to, get, around, what, the, great, telescope, sees, he, said, fail, to, stand, up, the, explosion, for, example, would, have, had, to, start, long, after, the, earth, was, created, and, possibly, even, after, the, first, life, appeared, here, hubble, s, estimate, of, what, we, now, call, the, hubble, constant, would, put, the, big, bang, only, 2, billion, years, ago, hubble, married, grace, lillian, burke, leib, 1889, 1980, daughter, of, john, patrick, and, luella, kepford, burke, on, february, 26, 1924, hubble, was, raised, as, a, protestant, christian, but, some, of, his, later, statements, suggest, uncertainty, hubble, had, a, heart, attack, in, july, 1949, while, on, vacation, in, colorado, he, was, cared, for, by, his, wife, and, continued, on, a, modified, diet, and, work, schedule, he, died, of, cerebral, thrombosis, a, blood, clot, in, his, brain, on, september, 28, 1953, in, san, marino, california, no, funeral, was, held, for, him, and, his, wife, never, revealed, his, burial, site, hubble, s, papers, comprising, the, bulk, of, his, correspondence, photographs, notebooks, observing, logbooks, and, other, materials, are, held, by, the, huntington, library, in, san, marino, california, they, were, donated, by, his, wife, grace, burke, hubble, upon, her, death, in, 1980, in, 2011, the, journal, nature, reported, claims, that, hubble, might, have, played, a, role, in, the, redaction, of, key, parts, of, the, 1931, english, translation, of, lema, tre, s, 1927, paper, which, formulated, what, was, later, called, hubble, s, law, and, also, gave, observational, evidence, historians, quoted, in, the, article, were, skeptical, that, the, redactions, were, part, of, a, campaign, to, ensure, hubble, retained, priority, however, the, observational, astronomer, sidney, van, den, bergh, published, a, paper, suggesting, that, while, the, omissions, may, have, been, made, by, a, translator, they, may, still, have, been, deliberate, in, november, 2011, the, astronomer, mario, livio, reported, in, nature, that, a, letter, he, found, in, the, lema, tre, archive, demonstrated, that, the, redaction, had, been, made, by, lema, tre, himself, who, apparently, saw, no, point, in, publishing, scientific, content, which, had, already, been, reported, in, 1929, by, hubble, however, the, fact, remains, that, lema, tre, published, the, law, in, french, two, years, prior, to, hubble, during, hubble, s, life, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, did, not, cover, work, done, in, astronomy, hubble, spent, much, of, the, later, part, of, his, career, attempting, to, have, astronomy, considered, part, of, physics, instead, of, being, a, separate, science, he, did, this, largely, so, that, astronomers, including, himself, could, be, recognized, by, the, nobel, prize, committee, for, their, valuable, contributions, to, astrophysics, this, campaign, was, unsuccessful, in, hubble, s, lifetime, but, shortly, after, his, death, the, nobel, prize, committee, decided, that, astronomical, work, would, be, eligible, for, the, physics, prize, however, the, nobel, prize, is, not, awarded, posthumously, on, march, 6, 2008, the, united, states, postal, service, released, a, 41, cent, stamp, honoring, hubble, on, a, sheet, titled, american, scientists, designed, by, artist, victor, stabin, his, citation, reads, often, called, a, pioneer, of, the, distant, stars, astronomer, edwin, hubble, 1889, 1953, played, a, pivotal, role, in, deciphering, the, vast, and, complex, nature, of, the, universe, his, meticulous, studies, of, spiral, nebulae, proved, the, existence, of, galaxies, other, than, our, own, milky, way, had, he, not, died, suddenly, in, 1953, hubble, would, have, won, that, year, s, nobel, prize, in, physics, the, assertion, that, he, would, have, won, the, nobel, prize, in, 1953, is, likely, false, although, he, was, nominated, for, the, prize, that, year, the, other, scientists, on, the, american, scientists, sheet, include, gerty, cori, biochemist, linus, pauling, chemist, and, john, bardeen, physicist, in, the, 1980, documentary, cosmos, a, personal, voyage, by, astronomer, carl, sagan, hubble, s, life, and, work, are, portrayed, on, screen, in, episode, 10, the, edge, of, forever, the, play, creation, s, birthday, written, by, cornell, physicist, hasan,
