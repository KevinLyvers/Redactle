and, royalty, while, suleiman, was, campaigning, in, hungary, turkmen, tribes, in, central, anatolia, in, cilicia, revolted, under, the, leadership, of, kalender, elebi, some, hungarian, nobles, proposed, that, ferdinand, who, was, the, ruler, of, neighboring, austria, and, tied, to, louis, ii, s, family, by, marriage, be, king, of, hungary, citing, previous, agreements, that, the, habsburgs, would, take, the, hungarian, throne, if, louis, died, without, heirs, 52, however, other, nobles, turned, to, the, nobleman, john, z, polya, who, was, being, supported, by, suleiman, under, charles, v, and, his, brother, ferdinand, i, the, habsburgs, reoccupied, buda, and, took, possession, of, hungary, reacting, in, 1529, suleiman, marched, through, the, valley, of, the, danube, and, regained, control, of, buda, in, the, following, autumn, his, forces, laid, the, siege, to, vienna, this, was, to, be, the, ottoman, empire, s, most, ambitious, expedition, and, the, apogee, of, its, drive, to, the, west, with, a, reinforced, garrison, of, 16, 000, men, the, austrians, inflicted, the, first, defeat, on, suleiman, sowing, the, seeds, of, a, bitter, ottoman, habsburg, rivalry, that, lasted, until, the, 20th, century, his, second, attempt, to, conquer, vienna, failed, in, 1532, as, ottoman, forces, were, delayed, by, the, siege, of, g, ns, and, failed, to, reach, vienna, in, both, cases, the, ottoman, army, was, plagued, by, bad, weather, forcing, them, to, leave, behind, essential, siege, equipment, and, was, hobbled, by, overstretched, supply, lines, 444, in, 1533, the, treaty, of,

tribute, and, accepted, the, ottoman, grand, vizier, as, his, brother, and, equal, in, rank, by, the, 1540s, a, renewal, of, the, conflict, in, hungary, presented, suleiman, with, the, opportunity, to, avenge, the, defeat, suffered, at, vienna, in, 1541, the, habsburgs, attempted, to, lay, siege, to, buda, but, were, repulsed, and, more, habsburg, fortresses, were, captured, by, the, ottomans, in, two, consecutive, campaigns, in, 1541, and, 1544, as, a, result, 53, ferdinand, and, charles, were, forced, to, conclude, a, humiliating, five, year, treaty, with, suleiman, ferdinand, renounced, his, claim, to, the, kingdom, of, hungary, and, was, forced, to, pay, a, fixed, yearly, sum, to, the, sultan, for, the, hungarian, lands, he, continued, to, control, of, more, symbolic, importance,

without, resistance, suleiman, joined, ibrahim, in, 1534, they, made, a, push, towards, persia, only, to, find, the, shah, sacrificing, territory, instead, of, facing, a, pitched, battle, resorting, to, harassment, of, the, ottoman, army, as, it, proceeded, along, the, harsh, interior, in, 1535, suleiman, made, a, grand, entrance, into, baghdad, he, enhanced, his, local, support, by, restoring, the, tomb, of, abu, hanifa, the, founder, of, the, hanafi, school, of, islamic, law, to, which, the, ottomans, adhered, attempting, to, defeat, the, shah, once, and, for, all, suleiman, embarked, upon, a, second, campaign, in, 1548, 1549, as, in, the, previous, attempt, tahmasp, avoided, confrontation, with, the, ottoman, army, and, instead, chose, to, retreat, using, scorched, earth, tactics, in, the, process, and, exposing, the, ottoman, army, to, the, harsh, winter, of, the, caucasus, suleiman, abandoned, the, campaign, with, temporary, ottoman, gains, in, tabriz, and, the, urmia,

parts, of, persia, the, shah, s, army, continued, its, strategy, of, avoiding, the, ottomans, leading, to, a, stalemate, from, which, neither, army, made, any, significant, gain, in, 1555, a, settlement, known, as, the, peace, of, amasya, was, signed, which, defined, the, borders, of, the, two, empires, by, this, treaty, armenia, and, georgia, were, divided, equally, between, the, two,

1514, ibrahim, converted, to, islam, and, suleiman, made, him, the, royal, falconer, then, promoted, him, to, first, officer, of, the, royal, bedchamber, 87, it, was, reported, that, they, slept,

at, the, time, ibrahim, was, only, about, thirty, years, old, and, lacked, any, actual, military, expertise, it, is, said, that, tongues, wagged, at, this, unprecedented, promotion, straight, from, palace, service, to, the, two, highest, offices, of, the, empire, during, his, thirteen, years, as, grand, vizier, his, rapid, rise, to, power, and, vast, accumulation, of, wealth, had, made, ibrahim, many, enemies, at, the, sultan, s, court, suleiman, s, suspicion, of, ibrahim, was, worsened, by, a, quarrel, between, the, latter, and, the, finance, secretary, defterdar, skender, elebi, the, dispute, ended, in, the, disgrace, of, elebi, on, charges, of, intrigue, with, ibrahim, convincing, suleiman, to, sentence, the, defterdar, to, death, ibrahim, also, supported, ehzade, mustafa, as,

eldest, was, mahidevran, s, son, while, selim, bayezid, and, cihangir, were, born, to, hurrem, hurrem, is, usually, held, at, least, partly, responsible, for, the, intrigues, in, nominating, a, successor, though, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, this, although, she, was, suleiman, s, wife, she, exercised, no, official, public, role, this, did, not, however, prevent, hurrem, from, wielding, powerful, political, influence, until, the, reign, of, ahmed, i, 1603, 1617, the, empire, had, no, formal, means, of, nominating, a, successor, so, successions, usually, involved, the, death, of, competing, princes, in, order, to, avert, civil, unrest, and, rebellions, by, 1552, when, the, campaign, against, persia, had, begun, with, r, stem, appointed, commander, in, chief, of, the, expedition, intrigues, against, mustafa, began, r, stem, sent, one, of, suleiman, s, most, trusted, men, to, report, that, since, suleiman, was, not, at, the, head, of, the, army, the, soldiers, thought, the, time, had, come, to, put, a, younger, prince, on, the, throne, at, the, same, time, he, spread, rumours, that, mustafa, had, proved, receptive, to, the, idea, angered, by, what, he, came, to, believe, were, mustafa, s, plans, to, claim, the, throne, the, following, summer, upon, return, from, his, campaign, in, persia, suleiman, summoned, him, to, his, tent, in, the, ere, li, valley, when, mustafa, entered, his, father, s, tent, to, meet, with, him, suleiman, s, eunuchs, attacked, mustafa, and, after, a, long, struggle, the, mutes, killed, him, using, a, bow, string, cihangir, is, said, to, have, died, of, grief, a, few, months, after, the, news, of, his, half, brother, s, murder, 89, the, two, surviving, brothers, selim, and, bayezid, were, given, command, in, different, parts, of, the, empire, within, a, few, years, however, civil, war, broke, out, between, the, brothers, each, supported, by, his, loyal, forces, with, the, aid, of, his, father, s, army, selim, defeated, bayezid, in, konya, in, 1559, leading, the, latter, to, seek, refuge, with, the, safavids, along, with, his, four, sons, following, diplomatic, exchanges, the, sultan, demanded, from, the, safavid, shah, that, bayezid, be, either, extradited, or, executed, in, return, for, large, amounts, of, gold, the, shah, allowed, a, turkish, executioner, to, strangle, bayezid, and, his, four, sons, in, 1561, 89, clearing, the, path, for, selim, s, succession, to, the, throne, five, years, later, on, 6, september, 1566, suleiman, who, had, set, out, from, constantinople, to, command, an, expedition, to, hungary, died, before, an, ottoman, victory, at, the, siege, of, szigetv, r, in, hungary, at, the, age, of, 71, 545, and, his, grand, vizier, sokollu, mehmed, pasha, kept, his, death, secret, during, the, retreat, for, the, enthronement, of, selim, ii, the, sultan, s, body, was, taken, back, to, istanbul, to, be, buried, while, his, heart, liver, and, some, other, organs, were, buried, in, turb, k, outside, szigetv, r, a, mausoleum, constructed, above, the, burial, site, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, holy, place, and, pilgrimage, site, within, a, decade, a, mosque, and, sufi, hospice, were, built, near, it, and, the, site, was, protected, by, a, salaried, garrison, of, several, dozen, men, the, formation, of, suleiman, s, legacy, began, even, before, his, death, throughout, his, reign, literary, works, were, commissioned, praising, suleiman, and, constructing, an, image, of, him, as, an, ideal, ruler, most, significantly, by, celalzade, mustafa, chancellor, of, the, empire, from, 1534, to, 1557, 4, 5, 250, later, ottoman, writers, applied, this, idealised, image, of, suleiman, to, the, near, eastern, literary, genre, of, advice, literature, named, na, atn, me, urging, sultans, to, conform, to, his, model, of, rulership, and, to, maintain, the, empire, s, institutions, in, their, sixteenth, century, form, such, writers, were, pushing, back, against, the, political, and, institutional, transformation, of, the, empire, after, the, middle, of, the, sixteenth, century, and, portrayed, deviation, from, the, norm, as, it, had, existed, under, suleiman, as, evidence, of, the, decline, of, the, empire, 54, 55, 64, western, historians, failing, to, recognise, that, these, decline, writers, were, working, within, an, established, literary, genre, and, often, had, deeply, personal, reasons, for, criticizing, the, empire, long, took, their, claims, at, face, value, and, consequently, adopted, the, idea, that, the, empire, entered, a, period, of, decline, after, the, death, of, suleiman, 73, 77, since, the, 1980s, this, view, has, been, thoroughly, reexamined, and, modern, scholars, have, come, to, overwhelmingly, reject, the, idea, of, decline, labelling, it, an, untrue, myth, suleiman, s, conquests, had, brought, under, the, control, of, the, empire, major, muslim, cities, such, as, baghdad, many, balkan, provinces, reaching, present, day, croatia, and, hungary, and, most, of, north, africa, his, expansion, into, europe, had, given, the, ottoman, turks, a, powerful, presence, in, the, european, balance, of, power, indeed, such, was, the, perceived, threat, of, the, ottoman, empire, under, the, reign, of, suleiman, that, austria, s, ambassador, busbecq, warned, of, europe, s, imminent, conquest, on, side, are, the, resources, of, a, mighty, empire, strength, unimpaired, habituation, to, victory, endurance, of, toil, unity, discipline, frugality, and, watchfulness, can, we, doubt, what, the, result, will, be, when, the, turks, have, settled, with, persia, they, will, fly, at, our, throats, supported, by, the, might, of, the, whole, east, how, unprepared, we, are, i, dare, not, say, suleiman, s, legacy, was, not, however, merely, in, the, military, field, the, french, traveler, jean, de, th, venot, bears, witness, a, century, later, to, the, strong, agricultural, base, of, the, country, the, well, being, of, the, peasantry, the, abundance, of, staple, foods, and, the, pre, eminence, of, organization, in, suleiman, s, government, even, thirty, years, after, his, death, sultan, solyman, was, quoted, by, the, english, playwright, william, shakespeare, as, a, military, prodigy, in, the, merchant, of, venice, where, the, prince, of, morocco, boasts, about, his, prowess, by, saying, that, he, defeated, suleiman, in, three, battles, act, 2, scene, 1, through, the, distribution, of, court, patronage, suleiman, also, presided, over, a, golden, age, in, ottoman, arts, witnessing, immense, achievement, in, the, realms, of, architecture, literature, art, theology, and, philosophy, today, the, skyline, of, the, bosphorus, and, of, many, cities, in, modern, turkey, and, the, former, ottoman, provinces, are, still, adorned, with, the, architectural, works, of, mimar, sinan, one, of, these, the, s, leymaniye, mosque, is, the, final, resting, place, of, suleiman, he, is, buried, in, a, domed, mausoleum, attached, to, the, mosque, nevertheless, assessments, of, suleiman, s, reign, have, frequently, fallen, into, the, trap, of, the, great, man, theory, of, history, the, administrative, cultural, and, military, achievements, of, the, age, were, a, product, not, of, suleiman, alone, but, also, of, the, many, talented, figures, who, served, him, such, as, grand, viziers, ibrahim, pasha, and, r, stem, pasha, the, grand, mufti, ebussuud, efendi, who, played, a, major, role, in, legal, reform, and, chancellor, and, chronicler, celalzade, mustafa, who, played, a,
