guilder, purchase, would, be, a, cause, for, later, financial, difficulties, the, neighborhood, sheltered, many, immigrants, and, was, becoming, the, jewish, quarter, it, was, there, that, rembrandt, frequently, sought, his, jewish, neighbors, to, model, for, his, old, testament, scenes, one, of, the, great, patrons, at, the, early, stages, of, his, career, was, amsterdam, statesman, andries, de,

works, after, saskia, s, illness, the, widow, geertje, dircx, was, hired, as, titus, caretaker, and, dry, nurse, at, some, time, she, also, became, rembrandt, s, lover, in, may, 1649, she, left, and, charged, rembrandt, with, breach, of, promise, and, asked, to, be, awarded, alimony, rembrandt, tried, to, settle, the, matter, amicably, but, to, pay, her, lawyer, she, pawned, the, diamond, ring,

had, her, committed, to, a, women, s, house, of, correction, at, gouda, in, august, 1650, rembrandt, also, took, measures, to, ensure, she, stay, in, the, house, of, correction, for, as, long, as, possible, rembrandt, paid, for, the, costs, in, early, 1649, rembrandt, began, a, relationship, with, the, 23, year, old, hendrickje, stoffels, who, had, initially, been, his, maid, she, may, have, been, the, cause, of, geertje, s, leaving, in, that, year, he, made, no, dated, paintings, or, etchings, at, all, in, 1654, rembrandt, produced, a, controversial, nude, bathsheba, at, her, bath, in, june, hendrickje, received, three, summonses, from, the, reformed, church, to, answer, the, charge, that, she, had, committed, the, acts, of, a, whore, with, rembrandt, the, painter, in, july, she, admitted, her, guilt, and, was, banned, from, receiving, communion, rembrandt, was, not, summoned, to, appear, for, the, church, council, in, october, they, had, a, daughter, cornelia, had, he, remarried, he, would, have, lost, access, to, a, trust, set, up, for, titus, in, saskia, s, will, rembrandt, despite, his, artistic, success, found, himself, in, financial, turmoil, his, penchant, for, acquiring, art, prints, and, rare, items, led, him, to, live, beyond, his, means, in, january, 1653, the, sale, of, the, property, formally, was, finalized, but, rembrandt, still, had, to, cover, half, of, the, remaining, mortgage, creditors, began, pressing, for, installments, but, rembrandt, facing, financial, strain, sought, a, postponement, the, house, required, repairs, prompting, rembrandt, to, borrow, money, from, friends, including, jan, six, in, november, 1655, amid, a, year, overshadowed, by, plague, and, the, drafting, of, wills, rembrandt, s, 14, year, old, son, titus, took, a, significant, step, by, drafting, a, will, that, designated, his, father, as, the, sole, heir, effectively, sidelining, his, mother, s, family, in, december, rembrandt, orchestrated, a, sale, of, his, paintings, yet, the, earnings, failed, to, meet, expectations, this, tumultuous, period, deeply, impacted, the, art, industry, prompting, rembrandt, to, seek, a, high, court, arrangement, known, as, cessio, bonorum, despite, the, financial, difficulties, rembrandt, s, bankruptcy, wasn, t, forced, in, july, 1656, he, declared, his, insolvency, taking, stock, and, willingly, surrendered, his, assets, notably, he, had, already, transferred, the, house, to, his, son, both, the, authorities, and, his, creditors, showed, leniency, granting, him, ample, time, to, settle, his, debts, jacob, j, hinlopen, allegedly, played, a, role, in, november, 1657, another, auction, was, held, to, sell, his, paintings, as, well, as, a, substantial, number, of, etching, plates, and, drawings, some, by, renowned, artists, such, as, raphael, mantegna, and, giorgione, remarkably, rembrandt, was, permitted, to, retain, his, tools, as, a, means, of, generating, income, rembrandt, lost, the, guardianship, of, his, son, and, thus, control, over, his, actions, a, new, guardian, louis, crayers, claimed, the, house, in, settlement, of, titus, s, debt, the, sale, list, comprising, 363, items, offers, insight, into, rembrandt, s, diverse, collections, which, encompassed, old, master, paintings, drawings, roman, emperors, busts, greek, philosophers, statues, books, a, bible, two, globes, bonnets, armor, and, various, objects, from, asia, chinaware, as, well, as, a, collections, of, natural, history, specimens, two, lion, skins, a, bird, of, paradise, corals, and, minerals, unfortunately, the, prices, realized, in, the, sale, were, disappointing, by, february, 1658, rembrandt, house, was, sold, at, a, foreclosure, auction, and, the, family, moved, to, more, modest, lodgings, at, rozengracht, in, 1660, he, finished, ahasuerus, and, haman, at, the, feast, of, esther, which, he, sold, to, jan, j, hinlopen, early, december, 1660, the, sale, of, the, house, was, finalized, but, the, proceeds, went, directly, to, titus, guardian, two, weeks, later, hendrickje, and, titus, established, a, dummy, corporation, as, art, dealers, allowing, rembrandt, who, had, board, and, lodging, to, continue, his, artistic, pursuits, in, 1661, they, secured, a, contract, for, a, major, project, at, the, newly, completed, town, hall, the, resulting, work, the, conspiracy, of, claudius, civilis, was, rejected, by, the, mayors, and, returned, to, the, painter, within, a, few, weeks, the, surviving, fragment, in, stockholm, is, only, a, quarter, of, the, original, despite, these, setbacks, rembrandt, continued, to, receive, significant, portrait, commissions, and, completed, notable, works, such, as, the, sampling, officials, in, 1662, it, remains, a, challenge, to, gauge, rembrandt, s, wealth, accurately, as, he, may, have, overestimated, the, value, of, his, art, collection, nonetheless, half, of, his, assets, were, earmarked, for, titus, inheritance, in, march, 1663, with, hendrickje, s, illness, titus, assumed, a, more, prominent, role, isaac, van, hertsbeeck, rembrandt, s, primary, creditor, went, to, the, high, court, and, contested, titus, priority, for, payment, leading, to, legal, battles, that, titus, ultimately, won, in, 1665, when, he, came, of, age, during, this, time, rembrandt, worked, on, notable, pieces, like, the, jewish, bride, and, his, final, self, portraits, but, struggled, with, rent, arrears, notably, cosimo, iii, de, medici, grand, duke, of, tuscany, visited, rembrandt, twice, and, returned, to, florence, with, one, of, the, self, portraits, rembrandt, outlived, both, hendrickje, and, titus, he, died, on, friday, 4, october, 1669, and, was, buried, four, days, later, in, a, rented, grave, in, the, westerkerk, his, illegitimate, child, cornelia, 1654, 1684, eventually, moved, to, batavia, in, 1670, accompanied, by, an, obscure, painter, and, her, mother, s, inheritance, titus, considerable, inheritance, passed, to, his, only, child, titia, 1669, 1715, who, married, her, cousin, and, lived, at, blauwburgwal, rembrandt, s, life, was, marked, by, more, than, just, artistic, achievements, he, navigated, numerous, legal, and, financial, challenges, leaving, a, complex, legacy, in, a, letter, to, huygens, rembrandt, offered, the, only, surviving, explanation, of, what, he, sought, to, achieve, through, his, art, writing, that, the, greatest, and, most, natural, movement, translated, from, de, meeste, en, de, natuurlijkste, beweegelijkheid, the, word, beweegelijkheid, translates, to, emotion, or, motive, whether, this, refers, to, objectives, material, or, something, else, is, not, known, but, critics, have, drawn, particular, attention, to, the, way, rembrandt, seamlessly, melded, the, earthly, and, spiritual, earlier, 20th, century, connoisseurs, claimed, rembrandt, had, produced, well, over, 600, paintings, nearly, 400, etchings, and, 2, 000, drawings, more, recent, scholarship, from, the, 1960s, to, the, present, day, led, by, the, rembrandt, research, project, often, controversially, has, winnowed, his, oeuvre, to, nearer, 300, paintings, his, prints, traditionally, all, called, etchings, although, many, are, produced, in, whole, or, part, by, engraving, and, sometimes, drypoint, have, a, much, more, stable, total, of, slightly, under, 300, it, is, likely, rembrandt, made, many, more, drawings, in, his, lifetime, than, 2, 000, but, those, extant, are, more, rare, than, presumed, two, experts, claim, that, the, number, of, drawings, whose, autograph, status, can, be, regarded, as, effectively, certain, is, no, higher, than, about, 75, although, this, is, disputed, the, list, was, to, be, unveiled, at, a, scholarly, meeting, in, february, 2010, at, one, time, approximately, 90, paintings, were, counted, as, rembrandt, self, portraits, but, it, is, now, known, that, he, had, his, students, copy, his, own, self, portraits, as, part, of, their, training, modern, scholarship, has, reduced, the, autograph, count, to, over, forty, paintings, as, well, as, a, few, drawings, and, thirty, one, etchings, which, include, many, of, the, most, remarkable, images, of, the, group, some, show, him, posing, in, quasi, historical, fancy, dress, or, pulling, faces, at, himself, his, oil, paintings, trace, the, progress, from, an, uncertain, young, man, through, the, dapper, and, very, successful, portrait, painter, of, the, 1630s, to, the, troubled, but, massively, powerful, portraits, of, his, old, age, together, they, give, a, remarkably, clear, picture, of, the, man, his, appearance, and, his, psychological, make, up, as, revealed, by, his, richly, weathered, face, in, his, portraits, and, self, portraits, he, angles, the, sitter, s, face, in, such, a, way, that, the, ridge, of, the, nose, nearly, always, forms, the, line, of, demarcation, between, brightly, illuminated, and, shadowy, areas, a, rembrandt, face, is, a, face, partially, eclipsed, and, the, nose, bright, and, obvious, thrusting, into, the, riddle, of, halftones, serves, to, focus, the, viewer, s, attention, upon, and, to, dramatize, the, division, between, a, flood, of, light, an, overwhelming, clarity, and, a, brooding, duskiness, in, a, number, of, biblical, works, including, the, raising, of, the, cross, joseph, telling, his, dreams, and, the, stoning, of, saint, stephen, rembrandt, painted, himself, as, a, character, in, the, crowd, durham, suggests, that, this, was, because, the, bible, was, for, rembrandt, a, kind, of, diary, an, account, of, moments, in, his, own, life, among, the, more, prominent, characteristics, of, rembrandt, s, work, are, his, use, of, chiaroscuro, the, theatrical, employment, of, light, and, shadow, derived, from, caravaggio, or, more, likely, from, the, dutch, caravaggisti, but, adapted, for, very, personal, means, also, notable, are, his, dramatic, and, lively, presentation, of, subjects, devoid, of, the, rigid, formality, that, his, contemporaries, often, displayed, and, a, deeply, felt, compassion, for, mankind, irrespective, of, wealth, and, age, his, immediate, family, his, wife, saskia, his, son, titus, and, his, common, law, wife, hendrickje, often, figured, prominently, in, his, paintings, many, of, which, had, mythical, biblical, or, historical, themes, throughout, his, career, rembrandt, took, as, his, primary, subjects, the, themes, of, portraiture, landscape, and, narrative, painting, for, the, last, he, was, especially, praised, by, his, contemporaries, who, extolled, him, as, a, masterly, interpreter, of, biblical, stories, for, his, skill, in, representing, emotions, and, attention, to, detail, stylistically, his, paintings, progressed, from, the, early, smooth, manner, characterized, by, fine, technique, in, the, portrayal, of, illusionistic, form, to, the, late, rough, treatment, of, richly, variegated, paint, surfaces, which, allowed, for, an, illusionism, of, form, suggested, by, the, tactile, quality, of, the, paint, itself, rembrandt, must, have, realized, that, if, he, kept, the, paint, deliberately, loose, and, paint, like, on, some, parts, of, the, canvas, the, perception, of, space, became, much, greater, a, parallel, development, may, be, seen, in, rembrandt, s, skill, as, a, printmaker, in, the, etchings, of, his, maturity, particularly, from, the, late, 1640s, onward, the, freedom, and, breadth, of, his, drawings, and, paintings, found, expression, in, the, print, medium, as, well, the, works, encompass, a, wide, range, of, subject, matter, and, technique, sometimes, leaving, large, areas, of, white, paper, to, suggest, space, at, other, times, employing, complex, webs, of, line, to, produce, rich, dark, tones, lastman, s, influence, on, rembrandt, was, most, prominent, during, his, period, in, leiden, from, 1625, to, 1631, paintings, were, rather, small, but, rich, in, details, for, example, in, costumes, and, jewelry, religious, and, allegorical, themes, were, favored, as, were, tronies, in, 1626, rembrandt, produced, his, first, etchings, the, wide, dissemination, of, which, would, largely, account, for, his, international, fame, in, 1629, he, completed, judas, repentant, returning, the, pieces, of, silver, and, the, artist, in, his, studio, works, that, evidence, his, interest, in, the, handling, of, light, and, variety, of, paint, application, and, constitute, the, first, major, progress, in, his, development, as, a, painter, during, his, early, years, in, amsterdam, 1632, 1636, rembrandt, began, to, paint, dramatic, biblical, and, mythological, scenes, in, high, contrast, and, of, large, format, the, blinding, of, samson, 1636, belshazzar, s, feast, c, 1635, dana, 1636, but, reworked, later, seeking, to, emulate, the, baroque, style, of, rubens, with, the, occasional, help, of, assistants, in, uylenburgh, s, workshop, he, painted, numerous, portrait, commissions, both, small, jacob, de, gheyn, iii, and, large, portrait, of, the, shipbuilder, jan, rijcksen, and, his, wife, 1633, anatomy, lesson, of, dr, nicolaes, tulp, 1632, by, the, late, 1630s, rembrandt, had, produced, a, few, paintings, and, many, etchings, of, landscapes, often, these, landscapes, highlighted, natural, drama, featuring, uprooted, trees, and, ominous, skies, cottages, before, a, stormy, sky, c, 1641, the, three, trees, 1643, from, 1640, his, work, became, less, exuberant, and, more, sober, in, tone, possibly, reflecting, personal, tragedy, biblical, scenes, were, now, derived, more, often, from, the, new, testament, than, the, old, testament, as, had, been, the, case, before, in, 1642, he, painted, the, night, watch, the, most, substantial, of, the, important, group, portrait, commissions, which, he, received, in, this, period, and, through, which, he, sought, to, find, solutions, to, compositional, and, narrative, problems, that, had, been, attempted, in, previous, works, in, the, decade, following, the, night, watch, rembrandt, s, paintings, varied, greatly, in, size, subject, and, style, the, previous, tendency, to, create, dramatic, effects, primarily, by, strong, contrasts, of, light, and, shadow, gave, way, to, the, use, of, frontal, lighting, and, larger, and, more, saturated, areas, of, color, simultaneously, figures, came, to, be, placed, parallel, to, the, picture, plane, these, changes, can, be, seen, as, a, move, toward, a, classical, mode, of, composition, and, considering, the, more, expressive, use, of, brushwork, as, well, may, indicate, a, familiarity, with, venetian, art, susanna, and, the, elders, 1637, 47, at, the, same, time, there, was, a, marked, decrease, in, painted, works, in, favor, of, etchings, and, drawings, of, landscapes, in, these, graphic, works, natural, drama, eventually, made, way, for, quiet, dutch, rural, scenes, in, the, 1650s, rembrandt, s, style, changed, again, colors, became, richer, and, brush, strokes, more, pronounced, with, these, changes, rembrandt, distanced, himself, from, earlier, work, and, current, fashion, which, increasingly, inclined, toward, fine, detailed, works, his, use, of, light, becomes, more, jagged, and, harsh, and, shine, becomes, almost, nonexistent, his, singular, approach, to, paint, application, may, have, been, suggested, in, part, by, familiarity, with, the, work, of, titian, and, could, be, seen, in, the, context, of, the, then, current, discussion, of, finish, and, surface, quality, of, paintings, contemporary, accounts, sometimes, remark, disapprovingly, of, the, coarseness, of, rembrandt, s, brushwork, and, the, artist, himself, was, said, to, have, dissuaded, visitors, from, looking, too, closely, at, his, paintings, the, tactile, manipulation, of, paint, may, hearken, to, medieval, procedures, when, mimetic, effects, of, rendering, informed, a, painting, s, surface, the, result, is, a, richly, varied, handling, of, paint, deeply, layered, and, often, apparently, haphazard, which, suggests, form, and, space, in, both, an, illusory, and, highly, individual, manner, in, later, years, biblical, themes, were, often, depicted, but, emphasis, shifted, from, dramatic, group, scenes, to, intimate, portrait, like, figures, james, the, apostle, 1661, in, his, last, years, rembrandt, painted, his, most, deeply, reflective, self, portraits, from, 1652, to, 1669, he, painted, fifteen, and, several, moving, images, of, both, men, and, women, the, jewish, bride, c, 1666, in, love, in, life, and, before, god, rembrandt, produced, etchings, for, most, of, his, career, from, 1626, to, 1660, when, he, was, forced, to, sell, his, printing, press, and, practically, abandoned, etching, only, the, troubled, year, of, 1649, produced, no, dated, work, he, took, easily, to, etching, and, though, he, learned, to, use, a, burin, and, partly, engraved, many, plates, the, freedom, of, etching, technique, was, fundamental, to, his, work, he, was, very, closely, involved, in, the, whole, process, of, printmaking, and, must, have, printed, at, least, early, examples, of, his, etchings, himself, at, first, he, used, a, style, based, on, drawing, but, soon, moved, to, one, based, on, painting, using, a, mass, of, lines, and, numerous, bitings, with, the, acid, to, achieve, different, strengths, of, line, towards, the, end, of, the, 1630s, he, reacted, against, this, manner, and, moved, to, a, simpler, style, with, fewer, bitings, he, worked, on, the, so, called, hundred, guilder, print, in, stages, throughout, the, 1640s, and, it, was, the, critical, work, in, the, middle, of, his, career, from, which, his, final, etching, style, began, to, emerge, although, the, print, only, survives, in, two, states, the, first, very, rare, evidence, of, much, reworking, can, be, seen, underneath, the, final, print, and, many, drawings, survive, for, elements, of, it, in, the, mature, works, of, the, 1650s, rembrandt, was, more, ready, to, improvise, on, the, plate, and, large, prints, typically, survive, in, several, states, up, to, eleven, often, radically, changed, he, now, used, hatching, to, create, his, dark, areas, which, often, take, up, much, of, the, plate, he, also, experimented, with, the, effects, of, printing, on, different, kinds, of, paper, including, japanese, paper, which, he, used, frequently, and, on, vellum, he, began, to, use, surface, tone, leaving, a, thin, film, of, ink, on, parts, of, the, plate, instead, of, wiping, it, completely, clean, to, print, each, impression, he, made, more, use, of, drypoint, exploiting, especially, in, landscapes, the, rich, fuzzy, burr, that, this, technique, gives, to, the, first, few, impressions, his, prints, have, similar, subjects, to, his, paintings, although, the, 27, self, portraits, are, relatively, more, common, and, portraits, of, other, people, less, so, the, landscapes, mostly, small, largely, set, the, course, for, the, graphic, treatment, of, landscape, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, of, the, many, hundreds, of, drawings, rembrandt, made, only, about, two, hundred, have, a, landscape, motif, as, their, subject, and, of, the, approximately, three, hundred, etchings, about, thirty, show, a, landscape, as, for, his, painted, landscapes, one, does, not, even, get, beyond, eight, works, one, third, of, his, etchings, are, of, religious, subjects, many, treated, with, a, homely, simplicity, whilst, others, are, his, most, monumental, prints, a, few, erotic, or, just, obscene, compositions, have, no, equivalent, in, his, paintings, he, owned, until, forced, to, sell, it, a, magnificent, collection, of, prints, by, other, artists, and, many, borrowings, and, influences, in, his, work, can, be, traced, to, artists, as, diverse, as, mantegna, raphael, hercules, seghers, and, giovanni, benedetto, castiglione, drawings, by, rembrandt, and, his, pupils, followers, have, been, extensively, studied, by, many, artists, and, scholars, through, the, centuries, his, original, draughtsmanship, has, been, described, as, an, individualistic, art, style, that, was, very, similar, to, east, asian, old, masters, most, notably, chinese, masters, rembrandt, was, interested, in, mughal, miniatures, especially, around, the, 1650s, he, drew, versions, of, some, 23, mughal, paintings, and, may, have, owned, an, album, of, them, these, miniatures, include, paintings, of, shah, jahan, akbar, jahangir, and, dara, shikoh, and, may, have, influenced, the, costumes, and, other, aspects, of, his, works, rembrandt, painted, the, militia, company, of, captain, frans, banning, cocq, between, 1640, and, 1642, and, it, became, his, most, famous, work, this, picture, was, called, de, nachtwacht, by, the, dutch, and, the, night, watch, by, sir, joshua, reynolds, because, by, 1781, the, picture, was, so, dimmed, and, defaced, that, it, was, almost, indistinguishable, and, it, looked, quite, like, a, night, scene, after, it, was, cleaned, it, was, discovered, to, represent, broad, day, a, party, of, 18, musketeers, stepping, from, a, gloomy, courtyard, into, the, blinding, sunlight, for, th, ophile, thor, it, was, the, prettiest, painting, in, the, world, the, piece, was, commissioned, for, the, new, hall, of, the, kloveniersdoelen, the, musketeer, branch, of, the, civic, militia, rembrandt, departed, from, convention, which, ordered, that, such, genre, pieces, should, be, stately, and, formal, rather, a, line, up, than, an, action, scene, instead, he, showed, the, militia, readying, themselves, to, embark, on, a, mission, though, the, exact, nature, of, the, mission, or, event, is, a, matter, of, ongoing, debate, contrary, to, what, is, often, said, the, work, was, hailed, as, a, success, from, the, beginning, parts, of, the, canvas, were, cut, off, approximately, 20, from, the, left, hand, side, was, removed, to, make, the, painting, fit, its, new, position, when, it, was, moved, to, the, town, hall, in, 1715, in, 1817, this, large, painting, was, moved, to, the, trippenhuis, since, 1885, the, painting, is, on, display, at, the, rijksmuseum, in, 1940, the, painting, was, moved, to, kasteel, radboud, in, 1941, to, a, bunker, near, heemskerk, in, 1942, to, st, pietersberg, in, june, 1945, it, was, shipped, back, to, amsterdam, in, 1968, the, rembrandt, research, project, began, under, the, sponsorship, of, the, netherlands, organization, for, the, advancement, of, scientific, research, it, was, initially, expected, to, last, a, highly, optimistic, ten, years, art, historians, teamed, up, with, experts, from, other, fields, to, reassess, the, authenticity, of, works, attributed, to, rembrandt, using, all, methods, available, including, state, of, the, art, technical, diagnostics, and, to, compile, a, complete, new, catalogue, raisonn, of, his, paintings, as, a, result, of, their, findings, many, paintings, that, were, previously, attributed, to, rembrandt, have, been, removed, from, their, list, although, others, have, been, added, back, many, of, those, removed, are, now, thought, to, be, the, work, of, his, students, one, example, of, activity, is, the, polish, rider, now, housed, in, the, frick, collection, in, new, york, city, rembrandt, s, authorship, had, been, questioned, by, at, least, one, scholar, alfred, von, wurzbach, at, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, but, for, many, decades, later, most, scholars, including, the, foremost, authority, writing, in, english, julius, s, held, agreed, that, it, was, indeed, by, the, master, in, the, 1980s, however, dr, josua, bruyn, of, the, foundation, rembrandt, research, project, cautiously, and, tentatively, attributed, the, painting, to, one, of, rembrandt, s, closest, and, most, talented, pupils, willem, drost, about, whom, little, is, known, but, bruyn, s, remained, a, minority, opinion, the, suggestion, of, drost, s, authorship, is, now, generally, rejected, and, the, frick, itself, never, changed, its, own, attribution, the, label, still, reading, rembrandt, and, not, attributed, to, or, school, of, more, recent, opinion, has, shifted, even, more, decisively, in, favor, of, the, frick, in, his, 1999, book, rembrandt, s, eyes, simon, schama, and, the, rembrandt, project, scholar, ernst, van, de, wetering, melbourne, symposium, 1997, both, argued, for, attribution, to, the, master, those, few, scholars, who, still, question, rembrandt, s, authorship, feel, that, the, execution, is, uneven, and, favour, different, attributions, for, different, parts, of, the, work, a, similar, issue, was, raised, by, schama, concerning, the, verification, of, titles, associated, with, the, subject, matter, depicted, in, rembrandt, s, works, for, example, the, exact, subject, being, portrayed, in, aristotle, with, a, bust, of, homer, recently, retitled, by, curators, at, the, metropolitan, museum, has, been, directly, challenged, by, schama, applying, the, scholarship, of, paul, crenshaw, schama, presents, a, substantial, argument, that, it, was, the, famous, ancient, greek, painter, apelles, who, is, depicted, in, contemplation, by, rembrandt, and, not, aristotle, another, painting, pilate, washing, his, hands, is, also, of, questionable, attribution, critical, opinion, of, this, picture, has, varied, since, 1905, when, wilhelm, von, bode, described, it, as, a, somewhat, abnormal, work, by, rembrandt, scholars, have, since, dated, the, painting, to, the, 1660s, and, assigned, it, to, an, anonymous, pupil, possibly, aert, de, gelder, the, composition, bears, superficial, resemblance, to, mature, works, by, rembrandt, but, lacks, the, master, s, command, of, illumination, and, modeling, the, attribution, and, re, attribution, work, is, ongoing, in, 2005, four, oil, paintings, previously, attributed, to, rembrandt, s, students, were, reclassified, as, the, work, of, rembrandt, himself, study, of, an, old, man, in, profile, and, study, of, an, old, man, with, a, beard, from, a, us, private, collection, study, of, a, weeping, woman, owned, by, the, detroit, institute, of, arts, and, portrait, of, an, elderly, woman, in, a, white, bonnet, painted, in, 1640, the, old, man, sitting, in, a, chair, is, a, further, example, in, 2014, professor, ernst, van, de, wetering, offered, his, view, to, the, guardian, that, the, demotion, of, the, 1652, painting, old, man, sitting, in, a, chair, was, a, vast, mistake, it, is, a, most, important, painting, the, painting, needs, to, be, seen, in, terms, of, rembrandt, s, experimentation, this, was, highlighted, much, earlier, by, nigel, konstam, who, studied, rembrandt, throughout, his, career, rembrandt, s, own, studio, practice, is, a, major, factor, in, the, difficulty, of, attribution, since, like, many, masters, before, him, he, encouraged, his, students, to, copy, his, paintings, sometimes, finishing, or, retouching, them, to, be, sold, as, originals, and, sometimes, selling, them, as, authorized, copies, additionally, his, style, proved, easy, enough, for, his, most, talented, students, to, emulate, further, complicating, matters, is, the, uneven, quality, of, some, of, rembrandt, s, own, work, and, his, frequent, stylistic, evolutions, and, experiments, as, well, there, were, later, imitations, of, his, work, and, restorations, which, so, seriously, damaged, the, original, works, that, they, are, no, longer, recognizable, technical, investigation, of, rembrandt, s, paintings, in, the, possession, of, the, gem, ldegalerie, alte, meister, and, in, the, gem, ldegalerie, alte, meister, kassel, was, conducted, by, hermann, k, hn, in, 1977, the, pigment, analyses, of, some, thirty, paintings, have, shown, that, rembrandt, s, palette, consisted, of, the, following, pigments, lead, white, various, ochres, vandyke, brown, bone, black, charcoal, black, lamp, black, vermilion, madder, lake, azurite, ultramarine, yellow, lake, and, lead, tin, yellow, synthetic, orpiment, was, shown, in, the, shadows, of, the, sleeve, of, the, jewish, groom, this, toxic, arsenic, yellow, was, rarely, used, in, oil, painting, one, painting, saskia, van, uylenburgh, as, flora, reportedly, contains, gamboge, rembrandt, very, rarely, used, pure, blue, or, green, colors, the, most, pronounced, exception, being, belshazzar, s, feast, in, the, national, gallery, in, london, the, book, by, bomford, describes, more, recent, technical, investigations, and, pigment, analyses, of, rembrandt, s, paintings, predominantly, in, the, national, gallery, in, london, the, entire, array, of, pigments, employed, by, rembrandt, can, be, found, at, colourlex, the, best, source, for, technical, information, on, rembrandt, s, paintings, on, the, web, is, the, rembrandt, database, containing, all, works, of, rembrandt, with, detailed, investigative, reports, infrared, and, radiography, images, and, other, scientific, details, rembrandt, is, a, modification, of, the, spelling, of, the, artist, s, first, name, that, he, introduced, in, 1633, harmenszoon, indicates, that, his, father, s, name, is, harmen, van, rijn, indicates, that, his, family, lived, near, the, rhine, rembrandt, s, earliest, signatures, c, 1625, consisted, of, an, initial, r, or, the, monogram, rh, for, rembrant, harmenszoon, and, starting, in, 1629, rhl, the, l, stood, presumably, for, leiden, in, 1632, he, used, this, monogram, early, in, the, year, then, added, his, family, name, to, it, rhl, van, rijn, but, replaced, this, form, in, that, same, year, and, began, using, his, first, name, alone, with, its, original, spelling, rembrant, in, 1633, he, added, a, d, and, maintained, this, form, consistently, from, then, on, proving, that, this, minor, change, had, a, meaning, for, him, whatever, it, might, have, been, this, change, is, purely, visual, it, does, not, change, the, way, his, name, is, pronounced, curiously, enough, despite, the, large, number, of, paintings, and, etchings, signed, with, this, modified, first, name, most, of, the, documents, that, mentioned, him, during, his, lifetime, retained, the, original, rembrant, spelling, note, the, rough, chronology, of, signature, forms, above, applies, to, the, paintings, and, to, a, lesser, degree, to, the, etchings, from, 1632, presumably, there, is, only, one, etching, signed, rhl, v, rijn, the, large, format, raising, of, lazarus, b, 73, his, practice, of, signing, his, work, with, his, first, name, later, followed, by, vincent, van, gogh, was, probably, inspired, by, raphael, leonardo, da, vinci, and, michelangelo, who, then, as, now, were, referred, to, by, their, first, names, alone, rembrandt, ran, a, large, workshop, and, had, many, pupils, the, list, of, rembrandt, pupils, from, his, period, in, leiden, as, well, as, his, time, in, amsterdam, is, quite, long, mostly, because, his, influence, on, painters, around, him, was, so, great, that, it, is, difficult, to, tell, whether, someone, worked, for, him, in, his, studio, or, just, copied, his, style, for, patrons, eager, to, acquire, a, rembrandt, a, partial, list, should, include, ferdinand,
