age, hobsbawm, was, denied, a, lectureship, at, cambridge, by, political, enemies, and, blocked, for, a, time, from, a, professorship, at, birkbeck, for, the, same, reasons, hobsbawm, spoke, of, his,

the, dual, revolution, the, political, french, revolution, and, the, british, industrial, revolution, he, saw, their, effect, as, a, driving, force, behind, the, predominant, trend, towards, liberal, capitalism, today, another, recurring, theme, in, his, work, was, social, banditry, which, hobsbawm, placed, in, a, social, and, historical, context, thus, countering, the, traditional, view, of, it, being, a, spontaneous, and, unpredictable, form, of, primitive, rebellion, he, coined, the, term, long, nineteenth, century, which, begins, with, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, and, ends, with, the, start, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, he, published, numerous, essays, in, various, intellectual, journals, dealing, with, subjects, such, as, barbarity, in, the, modern, age, the, troubles, of,

1930s, when, it, was, frowned, upon, by, the, communist, party, hobsbawm, occasionally, wrote, about, other, forms, of, popular, music, such, as, in, his, 1963, article, beatles, and, before, in, which, he, predicts, that, the, beatles, are, probably, just, about, to, begin, their, slow, descent, and, that, n, 29, years, time, nothing, of, them, will, survive, hobsbawm, joined, the, sozialistischer, sch, lerbund, association, of, socialist, pupils, an, offshoot, of, the, young, communist, league, of, germany, in, berlin, in, 1931, and, the, communist, party, of, great, britain, cpgb, in, 1936, he, was, a, member, of, the, communist, party, historians, group, from, 1946, until, its, demise, and, subsequently, president, of, its, successor, the, socialist, history, society, until, his, death, the, soviet, invasion, of, hungary, in, 1956, led, thousands, of, its, members, to, leave, the, british, communist, party, but, hobsbawm, unique, among, his, colleagues, remained, in, the, party, but, was, mistrusted, by, its, leadership, and, ceased, political, work, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, hobsbawm, maintained, some, ties, to, former, colleagues, such, as, e, p, thompson, and, john, saville, who, had, left, the, cpgb, at, this, time, and, became, leading, lights, of, the, new, left, in, britain, occasionally, contributing, to, new, left, publications, but, also, providing, intelligence, reports, on, the, dissidents, to, cpgb, headquarters, he, later, described, the, new, left, as, a, half, remembered, footnote, he, signed, a, historians, letter, of, protest, against, the, soviet, invasion, of, hungary, and, was, firmly, in, favour, of, the, prague, spring, hobsbawm, was, a, leading, light, of, the, eurocommunist, faction, in, the, communist, party, of, great, britain, cpgb, that, began, to, gather, strength, after, 1968, when, the, cpgb, criticised, the, soviet, crushing, of, the, prague, spring, and, the, french, communist, party, s, failure, to, support, the, may, 68, movement, in, paris, in, the, forward, march, of, labour, halted, originally, a, marx, memorial, lecture, the, british, working, class, one, hundred, years, after, marx, that, was, delivered, to, a, small, audience, of, fellow, marxists, in, march, 1978, before, being, published, in, marxism, today, in, september, 1978, he, argued, that, the, working, class, was, inevitably, losing, its, central, role, in, society, and, that, left, wing, parties, could, no, longer, appeal, only, to, this, class, a, controversial, viewpoint, in, a, period, of, trade, union, militancy, hobsbawm, supported, neil, kinnock, s, transformation, of, the, british, labour, party, from, 1983, the, party, received, just, 28, per, cent, of, the, vote, in, that, year, s, elections, just, 2, per, cent, more, than, the, social, democratic, party, liberal, alliance, and, though, not, close, to, kinnock, came, to, be, referred, to, as, neil, kinnock, s, favourite, marxist, his, interventions, in, kinnock, s, remaking, of, the, labour, party, helped, prepare, the, ground, for, the, third, way, new, labour, and, tony, blair, whom, hobsbawm, later, derisively, referred, to, as, thatcher, in, trousers, until, the, cessation, of, publication, in, 1991, he, contributed, to, the, magazine, marxism, today, a, third, of, the, 30, reprints, of, marxism, today, s, feature, articles, that, appeared, in, the, guardian, during, the, 1980s, were, articles, or, interviews, by, or, with, hobsbawm, making, him, by, far, the, most, popular, of, all, contributors, in, addition, to, his, association, with, the, cpgb, hobsbawm, developed, close, ties, to, the, largest, communist, party, in, the, western, world, the, italian, communist, party, pci, of, which, he, declared, himself, a, spiritual, member, he, developed, contacts, with, italian, left, wing, academics, and, intellectuals, in, the, early, 1950s, which, led, to, him, encountering, the, work, of, antonio, gramsci, whose, writings, were, a, key, influence, on, hobsbawm, s, work, on, the, history, of, subaltern, groups, emphasising, their, agency, as, well, as, structural, factors, hobsbawm, spoke, favourably, about, pci, general, secretary, enrico, berlinguer, s, strategy, of, historic, compromise, in, the, 1970s, seeking, rapprochement, with, the, catholic, church, and, the, christian, democrats, providing, passive, support, to, the, latter, in, government, in, order, to, bring, the, communists, into, the, political, mainstream, by, accepting, italy, s, position, as, a, member, of, nato, thus, being, able, to, build, broader, alliances, and, convince, wider, sections, of, society, of, its, legitimacy, as, a, potential, governing, force, from, the, 1960s, his, politics, took, a, more, moderate, turn, as, hobsbawm, came, to, recognise, that, his, hopes, were, unlikely, to, be, realised, and, no, longer, advocated, socialist, systems, of, the, soviet, type, until, the, day, of, his, death, however, he, remained, firmly, entrenched, on, the, left, maintaining, that, the, long, term, outlooks, for, humanity, were, bleak, i, think, we, ought, to, get, out, of, that, 20th, century, habit, of, thinking, of, systems, as, mutually, exclusive, you, re, either, socialist, or, you, re, capitalist, or, whatever, hobsbawm, stated, in, 2009, in, regard, to, the, emergence, of, a, new, historical, system, there, are, plenty, of, people, who, still, think, so, i, think, very, few, attempts, have, been, made, to, build, a, system, on, the, total, assumption, of, social, ownership, and, social, management, at, its, peak, the, soviet, system, tried, it, and, in, the, past, 20, or, 30, years, the, capitalist, system, has, also, tried, it, in, both, cases, the, results, demonstrate, that, it, won, t, work, so, it, seems, to, me, the, problem, isn, t, whether, this, market, system, disappears, but, exactly, what, the, nature, of, the, mixture, between, market, economy, and, public, economy, is, and, above, all, in, my, view, what, the, social, objectives, of, that, economy, are, one, of, the, worst, things, about, the, politics, of, the, past, 30, years, is, that, the, rich, have, forgotten, to, be, afraid, of, the, poor, of, most, of, the, people, in, the, world, hobsbawm, stressed, that, since, communism, was, not, created, the, sacrifices, were, in, fact, not, justified, a, point, he, emphasised, in, age, of, extremes, still, whatever, assumptions, are, made, the, number, of, direct, and, indirect, victims, must, be, measured, in, eight, rather, than, seven, digits, in, these, circumstances, it, does, not, much, matter, whether, we, opt, for, a, conservative, estimate, nearer, to, ten, than, to, twenty, million, or, a, larger, figure, none, can, be, anything, but, shameful, and, beyond, palliation, let, alone, justification, i, add, without, comment, that, the, total, population, of, the, ussr, in, 1937, was, said, to, have, been, 164, millions, or, 16, 7, millions, less, than, the, demographic, forecasts, of, the, second, five, year, plan, 1933, 38, elsewhere, he, insisted, i, have, never, tried, to, diminish, the, appalling, things, that, happened, in, russia, though, the, sheer, extent, of, the, massacres, we, didn, t, realise, in, the, early, days, we, knew, a, new, world, was, being, born, amid, blood, and, tears, and, horror, revolution, civil, war, famine, we, knew, of, the, volga, famine, of, the, early, 20s, if, not, the, early, 30s, thanks, to, the, breakdown, of, the, west, we, had, the, illusion, that, even, this, brutal, experimental, system, was, going, to, work, better, than, the, west, it, was, that, or, nothing, with, regard, to, the, 1930s, he, wrote, that, it, is, impossible, to, understand, the, reluctance, of, men, and, women, on, the, left, to, criticise, or, even, often, to, admit, to, themselves, what, was, happening, in, the, ussr, in, those, years, or, the, isolation, of, the, ussr, s, critics, on, the, left, without, this, sense, that, in, the, fight, against, fascism, communism, and, liberalism, were, in, a, profound, sense, fighting, for, the, same, cause, not, to, mention, the, more, obvious, fact, that, in, the, conditions, of, the, 1930s, what, stalin, did, was, a, russian, problem, however, shocking, whereas, what, hitler, did, was, a, threat, everywhere, he, claimed, that, the, demise, of, the, ussr, was, traumatic, not, only, for, communists, but, for, socialists, everywhere, regarding, queen, elizabeth, ii, hobsbawm, stated, that, constitutional, monarchy, in, general, has, proved, a, reliable, framework, for, liberal, democratic, regimes, and, is, likely, to, remain, useful, on, the, nuclear, attacks, on, japan, in, world, war, ii, he, adhered, to, the, view, that, there, was, even, less, sign, of, a, crack, in, japan, s, determination, to, fight, to, the, end, which, is, why, nuclear, arms, were, dropped, on, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, to, ensure, a, rapid, japanese, surrender, he, believed, there, was, an, ancillary, political, non, military, reason, for, the, bombings, perhaps, the, thought, that, it, would, prevent, america, s, ally, the, ussr, from, establishing, a, claim, to, a, major, part, in, japan, s, defeat, was, not, absent, from, the, minds, of, the, us, government, either, hobsbawm, is, quoted, as, saying, that, next, to, sex, there, is, nothing, so, physically, intense, as, participation, in, a, mass, demonstration, at, a, time, of, great, public, exaltation, in, 1994, neal, ascherson, said, of, hobsbawm, no, historian, now, writing, in, english, can, match, his, overwhelming, command, of, fact, and, source, but, the, key, word, is, command, hobsbawm, s, capacity, to, store, and, retrieve, detail, has, now, reached, a, scale, normally, approached, only, by, large, archives, with, big, staffs, in, 2002, hobsbawm, was, described, by, right, leaning, magazine, the, spectator, as, arguably, our, greatest, living, historian, not, only, britain, s, but, the, world, s, while, niall, ferguson, wrote, that, hobsbawm, is, one, of, the, great, historians, of, his, generation, is, undeniable, his, quartet, of, books, beginning, with, the, age, of, revolution, and, ending, with, the, age, of, extremes, constitute, the, best, starting, point, i, know, for, anyone, who, wishes, to, begin, studying, modern, history, nothing, else, produced, by, the, british, marxist, historians, will, endure, as, these, books, will, in, 2003, the, new, york, times, described, him, as, one, of, the, great, british, historians, of, his, age, an, unapologetic, communist, and, a, polymath, whose, erudite, elegantly, written, histories, are, still, widely, read, in, schools, here, and, abroad, james, joll, wrote, in, the, new, york, review, of, books, that, eric, hobsbawm, s, nineteenth, century, trilogy, is, one, of, the, great, achievements, of, historical, writing, in, recent, decades, mark, mazower, wrote, of, his, historical, writings, being, about, trends, social, forces, large, scale, change, over, vast, distances, telling, that, kind, of, history, in, a, way, that, is, as, compelling, as, a, detective, story, is, a, real, challenge, of, style, and, composition, in, the, tetralogy, hobsbawm, shows, how, to, do, it, ian, kershaw, said, that, hobsbawm, s, take, on, the, twentieth, century, his, 1994, book, the, age, of, extremes, consisted, of, masterly, analysis, meanwhile, tony, judt, while, praising, hobsbawm, s, vast, knowledge, and, graceful, prose, cautioned, that, hobsbawm, s, bias, in, favour, of, the, ussr, communist, states, and, communism, in, general, and, his, tendency, to, disparage, any, nationalist, movement, as, passing, and, irrational, weakened, his, grasp, of, parts, of, the, 20th, century, with, regard, to, the, impact, of, his, marxist, outlook, and, sympathies, on, his, scholarship, ben, pimlott, saw, it, as, a, tool, not, a, straitjacket, he, s, not, dialectical, or, following, a, party, line, although, judt, argued, that, it, has, prevented, his, achieving, the, analytical, distance, he, does, on, the, 19th, century, he, isn, t, as, interesting, on, the, russian, revolution, because, he, can, t, free, himself, completely, from, the, optimistic, vision, of, earlier, years, for, the, same, reason, he, s, not, that, good, on, fascism, in, a, 2011, poll, by, history, today, magazine, he, was, named, the, third, most, important, historian, of, the, previous, 60, years, after, reading, age, of, extremes, kremlinologist, robert, conquest, concluded, that, hobsbawm, suffers, from, a, massive, reality, denial, regarding, the, ussr, and, john, gray, though, praising, his, work, on, the, nineteenth, century, has, described, hobsbawm, s, writings, on, the, post, 1914, period, as, banal, in, the, extreme, they, are, also, highly, evasive, a, vast, silence, surrounds, the, realities, of, communism, a, refusal, to, engage, which, led, the, late, tony, judt, to, conclude, that, hobsbawm, had, provincialised, himself, it, is, a, damning, judgement, in, a, 1994, interview, on, bbc, television, with, canadian, academic, michael, ignatieff, hobsbawm, said, that, the, deaths, of, millions, of, soviet, citizens, under, stalin, would, have, been, worth, it, if, a, genuinely, communist, society, had, been, the, result, hobsbawm, argued, that, in, a, period, in, which, as, you, might, imagine, mass, murder, and, mass, suffering, are, absolutely, universal, the, chance, of, a, new, world, being, born, in, great, suffering, would, still, have, been, worth, backing, but, unfortunately, the, soviet, union, was, not, the, beginning, of, the, world, revolution, the, following, year, when, asked, the, same, question, on, bbc, radio, 4, s, desert, island, discs, if, the, sacrifice, of, millions, of, lives, would, have, been, worth, the, future, communist, society, he, replied, that, s, what, we, felt, when, we, fought, the, second, world, war, he, repeated, what, he, had, already, said, to, ignatieff, when, he, asked, the, rhetorical, question, do, people, now, say, we, shouldn, t, have, had, world, war, ii, because, more, people, died, in, world, war, ii, than, died, in, stalin, s, terror, tony, judt, was, of, the, opinion, that, hobsbawm, clings, to, a, pernicious, illusion, of, the, late, enlightenment, that, if, one, can, promise, a, benevolent, outcome, it, would, be, worth, the, human, cost, but, one, of, the, great, lessons, of, the, 20th, century, is, that, it, s, not, true, for, such, a, clear, headed, writer, he, appears, blind, to, the, sheer, scale, of, the, price, paid, i, find, it, tragic, rather, than, disgraceful, neil, ascherson, believes, that, eric, is, not, a, man, for, apologising, or, feeling, guilty, he, does, feel, bad, about, the, appalling, waste, of, lives, in, soviet, communism, but, he, refuses, to, acknowledge, that, he, regrets, anything, he, s, not, that, kind, of, person, hobsbawm, himself, in, his, autobiography, wrote, that, he, desires, historical, understanding, not, agreement, approval, or, sympathy, the, 1930s, aside, hobsbawm, was, criticised, for, never, relinquishing, his, communist, party, membership, whereas, people, like, arthur, koestler, left, the, party, after, seeing, the, friendly, reception, of, nazi, foreign, minister, joachim, von, ribbentrop, in, moscow, during, the, years, of, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, 1939, 1941, hobsbawm, stood, firm, even, after, the, soviet, interventions, of, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1956, and, the, prague, spring, in, his, review, of, hobsbawm, s, 2002, memoirs, interesting, times, niall, ferguson, wrote, the, essence, of, communism, is, the, abnegation, of, individual, freedom, as, hobsbawm, admits, in, a, chilling, passage, the, party, had, the, first, or, more, precisely, the, only, real, claim, on, our, lives, its, demands, had, absolute, priority, we, accepted, its, discipline, and, hierarchy, we, accepted, the, absolute, obligation, to, follow, the, lines, it, proposed, to, us, even, when, we, disagreed, with, it, we, did, what, it, ordered, us, to, do, whatever, it, had, ordered, we, would, have, obeyed, if, the, party, ordered, you, to, abandon, your, lover, or, spouse, you, did, so, consider, some, of, the, lines, our, historian, dutifully, toed, he, accepted, the, order, to, side, with, the, nazis, against, the, weimar, supporting, social, democrats, in, the, great, berlin, transport, strike, of, 1932, he, accepted, the, order, to, side, with, the, nazis, against, britain, and, france, following, the, ribbentrop, molotov, pact, of, 1939, he, accepted, the, excommunication, of, tito, he, condoned, the, show, trials, of, men, like, l, szl, rajk, in, hungary, in, 1954, just, after, stalin, s, death, he, visited, moscow, as, one, of, the, honoured, members, of, the, historians, group, of, the, british, communist, party, he, admits, to, having, been, dismayed, when, two, years, later, khrushchev, denounced, stalin, s, crimes, at, the, twentieth, congress, of, the, soviet, communist, party, when, khrushchev, himself, ordered, the, tanks, into, budapest, hungary, hobsbawm, finally, spoke, up, publishing, a, letter, of, protest, but, he, did, not, leave, the, party, hobsbawm, let, his, membership, lapse, not, long, before, the, party, s, dissolution, in, 1991, in, his, memoirs, hobsbawm, wrote, the, dream, of, the, october, revolution, is, still, there, somewhere, inside, me, i, have, abandoned, nay, rejected, it, but, it, has, not, been, obliterated, to, this, day, i, notice, myself, treating, the, memory, and, tradition, of, the, ussr, with, an, indulgence, and, tenderness, reviewing, the, book, david, caute, wrote, one, keeps, asking, of, hobsbawm, didn, t, you, know, what, deutscher, and, orwell, knew, didn, t, you, know, about, the, induced, famine, the, horrors, of, collectivisation, the, false, confessions, the, terror, within, the, party, the, massive, forced, labour, of, the, gulag, as, orwell, himself, documented, a, great, deal, of, evidence, was, reliably, knowable, even, before, 1939, but, hobsbawm, pleads, that, much, of, it, was, not, reliably, knowable, until, khrushchev, s, denunciation, of, stalin, in, 1956, reviewing, hobsbawm, s, 2011, how, to, change, the, world, in, the, wall, street, journal, michael, c, moynihan, argued, when, the, bloody, history, of, 20th, century, communism, intrudes, upon, mr, hobsbawm, s, disquisitions, it, s, quickly, dismissed, of, the, countries, occupied, by, the, soviet, union, after, world, war, ii, the, second, world, war, he, says, with, characteristic, slipperiness, led, communist, parties, to, power, in, eastern, and, central, europe, he, explains, that, a, possible, critique, of, the, new, socialist, regimes, does, not, concern, us, here, why, did, communist, regimes, share, the, characteristics, of, state, terror, oppression, and, murder, to, answer, this, question, is, not, part, of, the, present, chapter, regarding, the, execrable, pact, between, nazi, germany, and, stalinist, russia, which, shocked, many, former, communist, sympathizers, into, lives, of, anticommunism, mr, hobsbawm, dismisses, the, zig, zags, and, turns, of, comintern, and, soviet, policy, specifically, the, about, turn, of, 1939, 41, which, need, not, detain, us, here, in, one, sense, mr, hobsbawm, s, admirers, are, right, about, his, erudition, he, possesses, an, encyclopedic, knowledge, of, marxist, thought, specifically, italian, communism, and, pre, soviet, socialist, movements, but, that, knowledge, is, wasted, when, used, to, write, untrustworthy, history, reviewing, the, same, book, francis, wheen, argued, in, a, similar, vein, when, writing, about, how, the, anti, fascist, campaigns, of, the, 1930s, brought, new, recruits, to, the, communist, cause, he, cannot, even, bring, himself, to, mention, the, hitler, stalin, pact, referring, only, to, temporary, episodes, such, as, 1939, 41, the, soviet, invasion, of, hungary, and, the, crushing, of, the, prague, spring, are, skipped, over, an, alternative, conservative, assessment, of, hobsbawm, came, from, matthew, walther, in, national, review, while, critical, of, hobsbawm, for, his, communist, sympathies, and, his, purported, views, about, israel, walther, wrote, that, there, is, no, denying, his, intelligence, and, erudition, and, concluded, that, if, hobsbawm, is, read, 50, or, 100, years, from, now, it, will, probably, be, despite, rather, than, because, of, his, politics, in, 2008, the, historian, tony, judt, summed, up, hobsbawm, s, career, thus, eric, j, hobsbawm, was, a, brilliant, historian, in, the, great, english, tradition, of, narrative, history, on, everything, he, touched, he, wrote, much, better, had, usually, read, much, more, and, had, a, broader, and, subtler, understanding, than, his, more, fashionable, emulators, if, he, had, not, been, a, lifelong, communist, he, would, be, remembered, simply, as, one, of, the, great, historians, of, the, 20th, century, hobsbawm, s, friend, historian, donald, sassoon, wrote, that, hobsbawm, was, not, a, jewish, historian, he, was, an, historian, who, happened, to, be, jewish, his, first, marriage, was, to, muriel, seaman, in, 1943, they, divorced, in, 1951, his, second, marriage, was, to, marlene, schwarz, in, 1962, with, whom, he, had, two, children, julia, hobsbawm, and, andy, hobsbawm, he, had, an, out, of, wedlock, son, joshua, bennathan, who, was, born, in, 1958, and, died, in, november, 2014, hobsbawm, died, from, complications, of, pneumonia, and, leukaemia, at, the, royal, free, hospital, in, london, on, 1, october, 2012, aged, 95, his, daughter, julia, said, he, d, been, quietly, fighting, leukaemia, for, a, number, of, years, without, fuss, or, fanfare, right, up, until, the, end, he, was, keeping, up, what, he, did, best, he, was, keeping, up, with, current, affairs, there, was, a, stack, of, newspapers, by, his, bed, following, hobsbawm, s, death, reactions, included, praise, for, his, sheer, academic, productivity, and, prowess, and, tough, reasoning, in, the, guardian, reacting, to, news, of, hobsbawm, s, death, ed, miliband, called, him, an, extraordinary, historian, a, man, passionate, about, his, politics, he, brought, history, out, of, the, ivory, tower, and, into, people, s, lives, he, was, cremated, at, golders, green, crematorium, and, his, ashes, were, interred, in, highgate, cemetery, very, close, to, karl, marx, a, memorial, service, for, hobsbawm, was, held, at, the, new, school, in, october, 2013, owing, to, his, status, as, a, widely, read, and, prominent, communist, historian, and, the, fact, that, his, ideology, had, influenced, his, work, hobsbawm, has, been, credited, with, spreading, marxist, thought, around, the, globe, his, writings, reached, particular, prominence, in, india, and, brazil, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, at, a, time, of, lively, debate, about, these, countries, political, and, social, future, emile, chabal, in, an, essay, for, aeon, wrote, in, the, period, from, the, early, 1960s, to, the, late, 80s, marxists, in, non, communist, countries, were, increasingly, able, to, participate, in, a, transnational, discussion, over, the, past, and, future, of, capitalism, and, the, most, promising, agents, of, revolutionary, change, hobsbawm, played, a, starring, role, in, these, discussions, and, occasionally, set, the, agenda, a, complete, list, of, eric, hobsbawm, s, publications, private, papers, and, other, unpublished, material, can, be, found, in, the, eric, hobsbawm, bibliography, archived, 22, december, 2020, at, the, wayback, machine
