him, a, proper, royal, burial, cleopatra, then, 14, years, of, age, would, have, traveled, with, the, roman, expedition, into, egypt, years, later, antony, would, profess, that, he, had, fallen, in, love, with, her, at, this, time, gabinius, was, put, on, trial, in, rome, for, abusing, his, authority, for, which, he, was, acquitted, but, his, second, trial, for, accepting, bribes, led, to, his, exile, from, which, he, was, recalled, seven, years, later, in, 48, bc, by, caesar, crassus, replaced, him, as, governor, of, syria, and, extended, his, provincial, command, to, egypt, but, crassus,

s, largely, germanic, and, gallic, roman, garrison, the, gabiniani, to, harass, people, in, the, streets, of, alexandria, and, installed, his, longtime, roman, financier, rabirius, as, his, chief, financial, officer, within, a, year, rabirius, was, placed, under, protective, custody, and, sent, back, to, rome, after, his, life, was, endangered, for, draining, egypt, of, its, resources, despite, these, problems, ptolemy, xii, created, a, will, designating, cleopatra, and, ptolemy, xiii, as, his, joint, heirs, oversaw, major, construction, projects, such, as, the, temple, of, edfu, and, a, temple, at, dendera, and, stabilized, the, economy, on, 31, may, 52, bc, cleopatra, was, made, a, regent, of, ptolemy, xii, as, indicated, by, an, inscription, in, the, temple, of, hathor, at, dendera, rabirius, was, unable, to, collect, the, entirety, of, ptolemy, xii, s, debt, by, the, time, of, the, latter, s, death, and, so, it, was, passed, on, to, his, successors, cleopatra, and, ptolemy, xiii, ptolemy, xii, died, sometime, before, 22, march, 51, bc, when, cleopatra, in, her, first, act, as, queen, began, her, voyage, to, hermonthis, near, thebes, to, install, a, new, sacred, buchis, bull, worshiped, as, an, intermediary, for, the, god, montu, in, the, ancient, egyptian, religion, cleopatra, faced, several, pressing, issues, and, emergencies, shortly, after, taking, the, throne, these, included, famine, caused, by, drought, and, a, low, level, of, the, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, and, lawless, behavior, instigated, by, the, gabiniani, the, now, unemployed, and, assimilated, roman, soldiers, left, by, gabinius, to, garrison, egypt, inheriting, her, father, s, debts, cleopatra, also, owed, the, roman, republic, 17, 5, million, drachmas, in, 50, bc, marcus, calpurnius, bibulus, proconsul, of, syria, sent, his, two, eldest, sons, to, egypt, most, likely, to, negotiate, with, the, gabiniani, and, recruit, them, as, soldiers, in, the, desperate, defense, of, syria, against, the, parthians, the, gabiniani, tortured, and, murdered, these, two, perhaps, with, secret, encouragement, by, rogue, senior, administrators, in, cleopatra, s, court, cleopatra, sent, the, gabiniani, culprits, to, bibulus, as, prisoners, awaiting, his, judgment, but, he, sent, them, back, to, cleopatra, and, chastised, her, for, interfering, in, their, adjudication, which, was, the, prerogative, of, the, roman, senate, bibulus, siding, with, pompey, in, caesar, s, civil, war, failed, to, prevent, caesar, from, landing, a, naval, fleet, in, greece, which, ultimately, allowed, caesar, to, reach, egypt, in, pursuit, of, pompey, by, 29, august, 51, bc, official, documents, started, listing, cleopatra, as, the, sole, ruler, evidence, that, she, had, rejected, her, brother, ptolemy, xiii, as, a, co, ruler, she, had, probably, married, him, but, there, is, no, record, of, this, the, ptolemaic, practice, of, sibling, marriage, was, introduced, by, ptolemy, ii, and, his, sister, arsinoe, ii, a, long, held, royal, egyptian, practice, it, was, loathed, by, contemporary, greeks, by, the, reign, of, cleopatra, however, it, was, considered, a, normal, arrangement, for, ptolemaic, rulers, despite, cleopatra, s, rejection, of, him, ptolemy, xiii, still, retained, powerful, allies, notably, the, eunuch, potheinos, his, childhood, tutor, regent, and, administrator, of, his, properties, others, involved, in, the, cabal, against, cleopatra, included, achillas, a, prominent, military, commander, and, theodotus, of, chios, another, tutor, of, ptolemy, xiii, cleopatra, seems, to, have, attempted, a, short, lived, alliance, with, her, brother, ptolemy, xiv, but, by, the, autumn, of, 50, bc, ptolemy, xiii, had, the, upper, hand, in, their, conflict, and, began, signing, documents, with, his, name, before, that, of, his, sister, followed, by, the, establishment, of, his, first, regnal, date, in, 49, bc, in, the, summer, of, 49, bc, cleopatra, and, her, forces, were, still, fighting, against, ptolemy, xiii, within, alexandria, when, pompey, s, son, gnaeus, pompeius, arrived, seeking, military, aid, on, behalf, of, his, father, after, returning, to, italy, from, the, wars, in, gaul, and, crossing, the, rubicon, in, january, of, 49, bc, caesar, had, forced, pompey, and, his, supporters, to, flee, to, greece, in, perhaps, their, last, joint, decree, both, cleopatra, and, ptolemy, xiii, agreed, to, gnaeus, pompeius, s, request, and, sent, his, father, 60, ships, and, 500, troops, including, the, gabiniani, a, move, that, helped, erase, some, of, the, debt, owed, to, rome, losing, the, fight, against, her, brother, cleopatra, was, then, forced, to, flee, alexandria, and, withdraw, to, the, region, of, thebes, by, the, spring, of, 48, bc, cleopatra, had, traveled, to, roman, syria, with, her, younger, sister, arsinoe, iv, to, gather, an, invasion, force, that, would, head, to, egypt, she, returned, with, an, army, but, her, advance, to, alexandria, was, blocked, by, her, brother, s, forces, including, some, gabiniani, mobilized, to, fight, against, her, so, she, camped, outside, pelousion, in, the, eastern, nile, delta, in, greece, caesar, and, pompey, s, forces, engaged, each, other, at, the, decisive, battle, of, pharsalus, on, 9, august, 48, bc, leading, to, the, destruction, of, most, of, pompey, s, army, and, his, forced, flight, to, tyre, lebanon, given, his, close, relationship, with, the, ptolemies, pompey, ultimately, decided, that, egypt, would, be, his, place, of, refuge, where, he, could, replenish, his, forces, ptolemy, xiii, s, advisers, however, feared, the, idea, of, pompey, using, egypt, as, his, base, in, a, protracted, roman, civil, war, in, a, scheme, devised, by, theodotus, pompey, arrived, by, ship, near, pelousion, after, being, invited, by, a, written, message, only, to, be, ambushed, and, stabbed, to, death, on, 28, september, 48, bc, ptolemy, xiii, believed, he, had, demonstrated, his, power, and, simultaneously, defused, the, situation, by, having, pompey, s, head, severed, and, embalmed, sent, to, caesar, who, arrived, in, alexandria, by, early, october, and, took, up, residence, at, the, royal, palace, caesar, expressed, grief, and, outrage, over, the, killing, of, pompey, and, called, on, both, ptolemy, xiii, and, cleopatra, to, disband, their, forces, and, reconcile, with, each, other, ptolemy, xiii, arrived, at, alexandria, at, the, head, of, his, army, in, clear, defiance, of, caesar, s, demand, that, he, disband, and, leave, his, army, before, his, arrival, cleopatra, initially, sent, emissaries, to, caesar, but, upon, allegedly, hearing, that, caesar, was, inclined, to, having, affairs, with, royal, women, she, came, to, alexandria, to, see, him, personally, historian, cassius, dio, records, that, she, did, so, without, informing, her, brother, dressed, in, an, attractive, manner, and, charmed, caesar, with, her, wit, plutarch, provides, an, entirely, different, account, that, alleges, she, was, bound, inside, a, bed, sack, to, be, smuggled, into, the, palace, to, meet, caesar, when, ptolemy, xiii, realized, that, his, sister, was, in, the, palace, consorting, directly, with, caesar, he, attempted, to, rouse, the, populace, of, alexandria, into, a, riot, but, he, was, arrested, by, caesar, who, used, his, oratorical, skills, to, calm, the, frenzied, crowd, caesar, then, brought, cleopatra, and, ptolemy, xiii, before, the, assembly, of, alexandria, where, caesar, revealed, the, written, will, of, ptolemy, xii, previously, possessed, by, pompey, naming, cleopatra, and, ptolemy, xiii, as, his, joint, heirs, caesar, then, attempted, to, arrange, for, the, other, two, siblings, arsinoe, iv, and, ptolemy, xiv, to, rule, together, over, cyprus, thus, removing, potential, rival, claimants, to, the, egyptian, throne, while, also, appeasing, the, ptolemaic, subjects, still, bitter, over, the, loss, of, cyprus, to, the, romans, in, 58, bc, judging, that, this, agreement, favored, cleopatra, over, ptolemy, xiii, and, that, the, latter, s, army, of, 20, 000, including, the, gabiniani, could, most, likely, defeat, caesar, s, army, of, 4, 000, unsupported, troops, potheinos, decided, to, have, achillas, lead, their, forces, to, alexandria, to, attack, both, caesar, and, cleopatra, after, caesar, managed, to, execute, potheinos, arsinoe, iv, joined, forces, with, achillas, and, was, declared, queen, but, soon, afterward, had, her, tutor, ganymedes, kill, achillas, and, take, his, position, as, commander, of, her, army, ganymedes, then, tricked, caesar, into, requesting, the, presence, of, the, erstwhile, captive, ptolemy, xiii, as, a, negotiator, only, to, have, him, join, the, army, of, arsinoe, iv, the, resulting, siege, of, the, palace, with, caesar, and, cleopatra, trapped, together, inside, lasted, into, the, following, year, of, 47, bc, sometime, between, january, and, march, of, 47, bc, caesar, s, reinforcements, arrived, including, those, led, by, mithridates, of, pergamon, and, antipater, the, idumaean, ptolemy, xiii, and, arsinoe, iv, withdrew, their, forces, to, the, nile, where, caesar, attacked, them, ptolemy, xiii, tried, to, flee, by, boat, but, it, capsized, and, he, drowned, ganymedes, may, have, been, killed, in, the, battle, theodotus, was, found, years, later, in, asia, by, marcus, junius, brutus, and, executed, arsinoe, iv, was, forcefully, paraded, in, caesar, s, triumph, in, rome, before, being, exiled, to, the, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesus, cleopatra, was, conspicuously, absent, from, these, events, and, resided, in, the, palace, most, likely, because, she, had, been, pregnant, with, caesar, s, child, since, september, 48, bc, caesar, s, term, as, consul, had, expired, at, the, end, of, 48, bc, however, antony, an, officer, of, his, helped, to, secure, caesar, s, appointment, as, dictator, lasting, for, a, year, until, october, 47, bc, providing, caesar, with, the, legal, authority, to, settle, the, dynastic, dispute, in, egypt, wary, of, repeating, the, mistake, of, cleopatra, s, sister, berenice, iv, in, having, a, female, monarch, as, sole, ruler, caesar, appointed, cleopatra, s, 12, year, old, brother, ptolemy, xiv, as, joint, ruler, with, the, 22, year, old, cleopatra, in, a, nominal, sibling, marriage, but, cleopatra, continued, living, privately, with, caesar, the, exact, date, at, which, cyprus, was, returned, to, her, control, is, not, known, although, she, had, a, governor, there, by, 42, bc, caesar, is, alleged, to, have, joined, cleopatra, for, a, cruise, of, the, nile, and, sightseeing, of, egyptian, monuments, although, this, may, be, a, romantic, tale, reflecting, later, well, to, do, roman, proclivities, and, not, a, real, historical, event, the, historian, suetonius, provided, considerable, details, about, the, voyage, including, use, of, thalamegos, the, pleasure, barge, constructed, by, ptolemy, iv, which, during, his, reign, measured, 90, metres, 300, ft, in, length, and, 24, metres, 80, ft, in, height, and, was, complete, with, dining, rooms, state, rooms, holy, shrines, and, promenades, along, its, two, decks, resembling, a, floating, villa, caesar, could, have, had, an, interest, in, the, nile, cruise, owing, to, his, fascination, with, geography, he, was, well, read, in, the, works, of, eratosthenes, and, pytheas, and, perhaps, wanted, to, discover, the, source, of, the, river, but, turned, back, before, reaching, ethiopia, caesar, departed, from, egypt, around, april, 47, bc, allegedly, to, confront, pharnaces, ii, of, pontus, the, son, of, mithridates, vi, of, pontus, who, was, stirring, up, trouble, for, rome, in, anatolia, it, is, possible, that, caesar, married, to, the, prominent, roman, woman, calpurnia, also, wanted, to, avoid, being, seen, together, with, cleopatra, when, she, had, their, son, he, left, three, legions, in, egypt, later, increased, to, four, under, the, command, of, the, freedman, rufio, to, secure, cleopatra, s, tenuous, position, but, also, perhaps, to, keep, her, activities, in, check, caesarion, cleopatra, s, alleged, child, with, caesar, was, born, 23, june, 47, bc, and, was, originally, named, pharaoh, caesar, as, preserved, on, a, stele, at, the, serapeum, of, saqqara, perhaps, owing, to, his, still, childless, marriage, with, calpurnia, caesar, remained, publicly, silent, about, caesarion, but, perhaps, accepted, his, parentage, in, private, cleopatra, on, the, other, hand, made, repeated, official, declarations, about, caesarion, s, parentage, naming, caesar, as, the, father, cleopatra, and, her, nominal, joint, ruler, ptolemy, xiv, visited, rome, sometime, in, late, 46, bc, presumably, without, caesarion, and, were, given, lodging, in, caesar, s, villa, within, the, horti, caesaris, as, with, their, father, ptolemy, xii, caesar, awarded, both, cleopatra, and, ptolemy, xiv, the, legal, status, of, friend, and, ally, of, the, roman, people, latin, socius, et, amicus, populi, romani, in, effect, client, rulers, loyal, to, rome, cleopatra, s, visitors, at, caesar, s, villa, across, the, tiber, included, the, senator, cicero, who, found, her, arrogant, sosigenes, of, alexandria, one, of, the, members, of, cleopatra, s, court, aided, caesar, in, the, calculations, for, the, new, julian, calendar, put, into, effect, 1, january, 45, bc, the, temple, of, venus, genetrix, established, in, the, forum, of, caesar, on, 25, september, 46, bc, contained, a, golden, statue, of, cleopatra, which, stood, there, at, least, until, the, 3rd, century, ad, associating, the, mother, of, caesar, s, child, directly, with, the, goddess, venus, mother, of, the, romans, the, statue, also, subtly, linked, the, egyptian, goddess, isis, with, the, roman, religion, cleopatra, s, presence, in, rome, most, likely, had, an, effect, on, the, events, at, the, lupercalia, festival, a, month, before, caesar, s, assassination, antony, attempted, to, place, a, royal, diadem, on, caesar, s, head, but, the, latter, refused, in, what, was, most, likely, a, staged, performance, perhaps, to, gauge, the, roman, public, s, mood, about, accepting, hellenistic, style, kingship, cicero, who, was, present, at, the, festival, mockingly, asked, where, the, diadem, came, from, an, obvious, reference, to, the, ptolemaic, queen, whom, he, abhorred, caesar, was, assassinated, on, the, ides, of, march, 15, march, 44, bc, but, cleopatra, stayed, in, rome, until, about, mid, april, in, the, vain, hope, of, having, caesarion, recognized, as, caesar, s, heir, however, caesar, s, will, named, his, grandnephew, octavian, as, the, primary, heir, and, octavian, arrived, in, italy, around, the, same, time, cleopatra, decided, to, depart, for, egypt, a, few, months, later, cleopatra, had, ptolemy, xiv, killed, by, poisoning, elevating, her, son, caesarion, as, her, co, ruler, octavian, antony, and, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, formed, the, second, triumvirate, in, 43, bc, in, which, they, were, each, elected, for, five, year, terms, to, restore, order, in, the, republic, and, bring, caesar, s, assassins, to, justice, cleopatra, received, messages, from, both, gaius, cassius, longinus, one, of, caesar, s, assassins, and, publius, cornelius, dolabella, proconsul, of, syria, and, caesarian, loyalist, requesting, military, aid, she, decided, to, write, cassius, an, excuse, that, her, kingdom, faced, too, many, internal, problems, while, sending, the, four, legions, left, by, caesar, in, egypt, to, dolabella, these, troops, were, captured, by, cassius, in, palestine, while, serapion, cleopatra, s, governor, of, cyprus, defected, to, cassius, and, provided, him, with, ships, cleopatra, took, her, own, fleet, to, greece, to, personally, assist, octavian, and, antony, her, ships, were, heavily, damaged, in, a, mediterranean, storm, and, she, arrived, too, late, to, aid, in, the, fighting, by, the, autumn, of, 42, bc, antony, had, defeated, the, forces, of, caesar, s, assassins, at, the, battle, of, philippi, in, greece, leading, to, the, suicide, of, cassius, and, brutus, by, the, end, of, 42, bc, octavian, had, gained, control, over, much, of, the, western, half, of, the, roman, republic, and, antony, the, eastern, half, with, lepidus, largely, marginalized, in, the, summer, of, 41, bc, antony, established, his, headquarters, at, tarsos, in, anatolia, and, summoned, cleopatra, there, in, several, letters, which, she, rebuffed, until, antony, s, envoy, quintus, dellius, convinced, her, to, come, the, meeting, would, allow, cleopatra, to, clear, up, the, misconception, that, she, had, supported, cassius, during, the, civil, war, and, address, territorial, exchanges, in, the, levant, but, antony, also, undoubtedly, desired, to, form, a, personal, romantic, relationship, with, the, queen, cleopatra, sailed, up, the, kydnos, river, to, tarsos, in, thalamegos, hosting, antony, and, his, officers, for, two, nights, of, lavish, banquets, on, board, the, ship, cleopatra, managed, to, clear, her, name, as, a, supposed, supporter, of, cassius, arguing, she, had, really, attempted, to, help, dolabella, in, syria, and, convinced, antony, to, have, her, exiled, sister, arsinoe, iv, executed, at, ephesus, cleopatra, s, former, rebellious, governor, of, cyprus, was, also, handed, over, to, her, for, execution, cleopatra, invited, antony, to, come, to, egypt, before, departing, from, tarsos, which, led, antony, to, visit, alexandria, by, november, 41, bc, antony, was, well, received, by, the, populace, of, alexandria, both, for, his, heroic, actions, in, restoring, ptolemy, xii, to, power, and, coming, to, egypt, without, an, occupation, force, like, caesar, had, done, in, egypt, antony, continued, to, enjoy, the, lavish, royal, lifestyle, he, had, witnessed, aboard, cleopatra, s, ship, docked, at, tarsos, he, also, had, his, subordinates, such, as, publius, ventidius, bassus, drive, the, parthians, out, of, anatolia, and, syria, cleopatra, carefully, chose, antony, as, her, partner, for, producing, further, heirs, as, he, was, deemed, to, be, the, most, powerful, roman, figure, following, caesar, s, demise, with, his, powers, as, a, triumvir, antony, also, had, the, broad, authority, to, restore, former, ptolemaic, lands, which, were, currently, in, roman, hands, to, cleopatra, while, it, is, clear, that, both, cilicia, and, cyprus, were, under, cleopatra, s, control, by, 19, november, 38, bc, the, transfer, probably, occurred, earlier, in, the, winter, of, 41, 40, bc, during, her, time, spent, with, antony, by, the, spring, of, 40, bc, antony, left, egypt, due, to, troubles, in, syria, where, his, governor, lucius, decidius, saxa, was, killed, and, his, army, taken, by, quintus, labienus, a, former, officer, under, cassius, who, now, served, the, parthian, empire, cleopatra, provided, antony, with, 200, ships, for, his, campaign, and, as, payment, for, her, newly, acquired, territories, she, would, not, see, antony, again, until, 37, bc, but, she, maintained, correspondence, and, evidence, suggests, she, kept, a, spy, in, his, camp, by, the, end, of, 40, bc, cleopatra, had, given, birth, to, twins, a, boy, named, alexander, helios, and, a, girl, named, cleopatra, selene, ii, both, of, whom, antony, acknowledged, as, his, children, helios, the, sun, and, selene, the, moon, were, symbolic, of, a, new, era, of, societal, rejuvenation, as, well, as, an, indication, that, cleopatra, hoped, antony, would, repeat, the, exploits, of, alexander, the, great, by, conquering, the, parthians, mark, antony, s, parthian, campaign, in, the, east, was, disrupted, by, the, events, of, the, perusine, war, 41, 40, bc, initiated, by, his, ambitious, wife, fulvia, against, octavian, in, the, hopes, of, making, her, husband, the, undisputed, leader, of, rome, it, has, been, suggested, that, fulvia, wanted, to, cleave, antony, away, from, cleopatra, but, the, conflict, emerged, in, italy, even, before, cleopatra, s, meeting, with, antony, at, tarsos, fulvia, and, antony, s, brother, lucius, antonius, were, eventually, besieged, by, octavian, at, perusia, modern, perugia, italy, and, then, exiled, from, italy, after, which, fulvia, died, at, sicyon, in, greece, while, attempting, to, reach, antony, her, sudden, death, led, to, a, reconciliation, of, octavian, and, antony, at, brundisium, in, italy, in, september, 40, bc, although, the, agreement, struck, at, brundisium, solidified, antony, s, control, of, the, roman, republic, s, territories, east, of, the, ionian, sea, it, also, stipulated, that, he, concede, italia, hispania, and, gaul, and, marry, octavian, s, sister, octavia, the, younger, a, potential, rival, for, cleopatra, in, december, 40, bc, cleopatra, received, herod, in, alexandria, as, an, unexpected, guest, and, refugee, who, fled, a, turbulent, situation, in, judea, herod, had, been, installed, as, a, tetrarch, there, by, antony, but, he, was, soon, at, odds, with, antigonus, ii, mattathias, of, the, long, established, hasmonean, dynasty, the, latter, had, imprisoned, herod, s, brother, and, fellow, tetrarch, phasael, who, was, executed, while, herod, was, fleeing, toward, cleopatra, s, court, cleopatra, attempted, to, provide, him, with, a, military, assignment, but, herod, declined, and, traveled, to, rome, where, the, triumvirs, octavian, and, antony, named, him, king, of, judea, this, act, put, herod, on, a, collision, course, with, cleopatra, who, would, desire, to, reclaim, the, former, ptolemaic, territories, that, comprised, his, new, herodian, kingdom, relations, between, antony, and, cleopatra, perhaps, soured, when, he, not, only, married, octavia, but, also, sired, her, two, children, antonia, the, elder, in, 39, bc, and, antonia, minor, in, 36, bc, and, moved, his, headquarters, to, athens, however, cleopatra, s, position, in, egypt, was, secure, her, rival, herod, was, occupied, with, civil, war, in, judea, that, required, heavy, roman, military, assistance, but, received, none, from, cleopatra, since, the, authority, of, antony, and, octavian, as, triumvirs, had, expired, on, 1, january, 37, bc, octavia, arranged, for, a, meeting, at, tarentum, where, the, triumvirate, was, officially, extended, to, 33, bc, with, two, legions, granted, by, octavian, and, a, thousand, soldiers, lent, by, octavia, antony, traveled, to, antioch, where, he, made, preparations, for, war, against, the, parthians, antony, summoned, cleopatra, to, antioch, to, discuss, pressing, issues, such, as, herod, s, kingdom, and, financial, support, for, his, parthian, campaign, cleopatra, brought, her, now, three, year, old, twins, to, antioch, where, antony, saw, them, for, the, first, time, and, where, they, probably, first, received, their, surnames, helios, and, selene, as, part, of, antony, and, cleopatra, s, ambitious, plans, for, the, future, in, order, to, stabilize, the, east, antony, not, only, enlarged, cleopatra, s, domain, he, also, established, new, ruling, dynasties, and, client, rulers, who, would, be, loyal, to, him, yet, would, ultimately, outlast, him, in, this, arrangement, cleopatra, gained, significant, former, ptolemaic, territories, in, the, levant, including, nearly, all, of, phoenicia, lebanon, minus, tyre, and, sidon, which, remained, in, roman, hands, she, also, received, ptolemais, akko, modern, acre, israel, a, city, that, was, established, by, ptolemy, ii, given, her, ancestral, relations, with, the, seleucids, she, was, granted, the, region, of, coele, syria, along, the, upper, orontes, river, she, was, even, given, the, region, surrounding, jericho, in, palestine, but, she, leased, this, territory, back, to, herod, at, the, expense, of, the, nabataean, king, malichus, i, a, cousin, of, herod, cleopatra, was, also, given, a, portion, of, the, nabataean, kingdom, around, the, gulf, of, aqaba, on, the, red, sea, including, ailana, modern, aqaba, jordan, to, the, west, cleopatra, was, handed, cyrene, along, the, libyan, coast, as, well, as, itanos, and, olous, in, roman, crete, although, still, administered, by, roman, officials, these, territories, nevertheless, enriched, her, kingdom, and, led, her, to, declare, the, inauguration, of, a, new, era, by, double, dating, her, coinage, in, 36, bc, antony, s, enlargement, of, the, ptolemaic, realm, by, relinquishing, directly, controlled, roman, territory, was, exploited, by, his, rival, octavian, who, tapped, into, the, public, sentiment, in, rome, against, the, empowerment, of, a, foreign, queen, at, the, expense, of, their, republic, octavian, fostering, the, narrative, that, antony, was, neglecting, his, virtuous, roman, wife, octavia, granted, both, her, and, livia, his, own, wife, extraordinary, privileges, of, sacrosanctity, some, 50, years, before, cornelia, africana, daughter, of, scipio, africanus, had, been, the, first, living, roman, woman, to, have, a, statue, dedicated, to, her, she, was, now, followed, by, octavia, and, livia, whose, statues, were, most, likely, erected, in, the, forum, of, caesar, to, rival, that, of, cleopatra, s, erected, by, caesar, in, 36, bc, cleopatra, accompanied, antony, to, the, euphrates, in, his, journey, toward, invading, the, parthian, empire, she, then, returned, to, egypt, perhaps, due, to, her, advanced, state, of, pregnancy, by, the, summer, of, 36, bc, she, had, given, birth, to, ptolemy, philadelphus, her, second, son, with, antony, antony, s, parthian, campaign, in, 36, bc, turned, into, a, complete, debacle, for, a, number, of, reasons, in, particular, the, betrayal, of, artavasdes, ii, of, armenia, who, defected, to, the, parthian, side, after, losing, some, 30, 000, men, more, than, crassus, at, carrhae, an, indignity, he, had, hoped, to, avenge, antony, finally, arrived, at, leukokome, near, berytus, modern, beirut, lebanon, in, december, engaged, in, heavy, drinking, before, cleopatra, arrived, to, provide, funds, and, clothing, for, his, battered, troops, antony, desired, to, avoid, the, risks, involved, in, returning, to, rome, and, so, he, traveled, with, cleopatra, back, to, alexandria, to, see, his, newborn, son, as, antony, prepared, for, another, parthian, expedition, in, 35, bc, this, time, aimed, at, their, ally, armenia, octavia, traveled, to, athens, with, 2, 000, troops, in, alleged, support, of, antony, but, most, likely, in, a, scheme, devised, by, octavian, to, embarrass, him, for, his, military, losses, antony, received, these, troops, but, told, octavia, not, to, stray, east, of, athens, as, he, and, cleopatra, traveled, together, to, antioch, only, to, suddenly, and, inexplicably, abandon, the, military, campaign, and, head, back, to, alexandria, when, octavia, returned, to, rome, octavian, portrayed, his, sister, as, a, victim, wronged, by, antony, although, she, refused, to, leave, antony, s, household, octavian, s, confidence, grew, as, he, eliminated, his, rivals, in, the, west, including, sextus, pompeius, and, even, lepidus, the, third, member, of, the, triumvirate, who, was, placed, under, house, arrest, after, revolting, against, octavian, in, sicily, dellius, was, sent, as, antony, s, envoy, to, artavasdes, ii, in, 34, bc, to, negotiate, a, potential, marriage, alliance, that, would, wed, the, armenian, king, s, daughter, to, alexander, helios, the, son, of, antony, and, cleopatra, when, this, was, declined, antony, marched, his, army, into, armenia, defeated, their, forces, and, captured, the, king, and, armenian, royal, family, antony, then, held, a, military, parade, in, alexandria, as, an, imitation, of, a, roman, triumph, dressed, as, dionysus, and, riding, into, the, city, on, a, chariot, to, present, the, royal, prisoners, to, cleopatra, who, was, seated, on, a, golden, throne, above, a, silver, dais, news, of, this, event, was, heavily, criticized, in, rome, as, a, perversion, of, time, honored, roman, rites, and, rituals, to, be, enjoyed, instead, by, an, egyptian, queen, in, an, event, held, at, the, gymnasium, soon, after, the, triumph, cleopatra, dressed, as, isis, and, declared, that, she, was, the, queen, of, kings, with, her, son, caesarion, king, of, kings, while, alexander, helios, was, declared, king, of, armenia, media, and, parthia, and, two, year, old, ptolemy, philadelphus, was, declared, king, of, syria, and, cilicia, cleopatra, selene, ii, was, bestowed, with, crete, and, cyrene, antony, and, cleopatra, may, have, been, wed, during, this, ceremony, antony, sent, a, report, to, rome, requesting, ratification, of, these, territorial, claims, now, known, as, the, donations, of, alexandria, octavian, wanted, to, publicize, it, for, propaganda, purposes, but, the, two, consuls, both, supporters, of, antony, had, it, censored, from, public, view, in, late, 34, bc, antony, and, octavian, engaged, in, a, heated, war, of, propaganda, that, would, last, for, years, antony, claimed, that, his, rival, had, illegally, deposed, lepidus, from, their, triumvirate, and, barred, him, from, raising, troops, in, italy, while, octavian, accused, antony, of, unlawfully, detaining, the, king, of, armenia, marrying, cleopatra, despite, still, being, married, to, his, sister, octavia, and, wrongfully, claiming, caesarion, as, the, heir, of, caesar, instead, of, octavian, the, litany, of, accusations, and, gossip, associated, with, this, propaganda, war, have, shaped, the, popular, perceptions, about, cleopatra, from, augustan, period, literature, through, to, various, media, in, modern, times, cleopatra, was, said, to, have, brainwashed, mark, antony, with, witchcraft, and, sorcery, and, was, as, dangerous, as, homer, s, helen, of, troy, in, destroying, civilization, pliny, the, elder, claims, in, his, natural, history, that, cleopatra, once, dissolved, a, pearl, worth, tens, of, millions, of, sesterces, in, vinegar, just, to, win, a, dinner, party, bet, the, accusation, that, antony, had, stolen, books, from, the, library, of, pergamum, to, restock, the, library, of, alexandria, later, turned, out, to, be, an, admitted, fabrication, by, gaius, calvisius, sabinus, a, papyrus, document, dated, to, february, 33, bc, later, used, to, wrap, a, mummy, contains, the, signature, of, cleopatra, probably, written, by, an, official, authorized, to, sign, for, her, it, concerns, certain, tax, exemptions, in, egypt, granted, to, either, quintus, caecillius, or, publius, canidius, crassus, a, former, roman, consul, and, antony, s, confidant, who, would, command, his, land, forces, at, actium, a, subscript, in, a, different, handwriting, at, the, bottom, of, the, papyrus, reads, make, it, happen, or, so, be, it, ancient, greek, romanized, gin, sth, i, this, is, likely, the, autograph, of, the, queen, as, it, was, ptolemaic, practice, to, countersign, documents, to, avoid, forgery, in, a, speech, to, the, roman, senate, on, the, first, day, of, his, consulship, on, 1, january, 33, bc, octavian, accused, antony, of, attempting, to, subvert, roman, freedoms, and, territorial, integrity, as, a, slave, to, his, oriental, queen, before, antony, and, octavian, s, joint, imperium, expired, on, 31, december, 33, bc, antony, declared, caesarion, as, the, true, heir, of, caesar, in, an, attempt, to, undermine, octavian, in, 32, bc, the, antonian, loyalists, gaius, sosius, and, gnaeus, domitius, ahenobarbus, became, consuls, the, former, gave, a, fiery, speech, condemning, octavian, now, a, private, citizen, without, public, office, and, introduced, pieces, of, legislation, against, him, during, the, next, senatorial, session, octavian, entered, the, senate, house, with, armed, guards, and, levied, his, own, accusations, against, the, consuls, intimidated, by, this, act, the, consuls, and, over, 200, senators, still, in, support, of, antony, fled, rome, the, next, day, to, join, the, side, of, antony, antony, and, cleopatra, traveled, together, to, ephesus, in, 32, bc, where, she, provided, him, with, 200, of, the, 800, naval, ships, he, was, able, to, acquire, ahenobarbus, wary, of, having, octavian, s, propaganda, confirmed, to, the, public, attempted, to, persuade, antony, to, have, cleopatra, excluded, from, the, campaign, against, octavian, publius, canidius, crassus, made, the, counterargument, that, cleopatra, was, funding, the, war, effort, and, was, a, competent, monarch, cleopatra, refused, antony, s, requests, that, she, return, to, egypt, judging, that, by, blocking, octavian, in, greece, she, could, more, easily, defend, egypt, cleopatra, s, insistence, that, she, be, involved, in, the, battle, for, greece, led, to, the, defections, of, prominent, romans, such, as, ahenobarbus, and, lucius, munatius, plancus, during, the, spring, of, 32, bc, antony, and, cleopatra, traveled, to, athens, where, she, persuaded, antony, to, send, octavia, an, official, declaration, of, divorce, this, encouraged, plancus, to, advise, octavian, that, he, should, seize, antony, s, will, invested, with, the, vestal, virgins, although, a, violation, of, sacred, and, legal, rights, octavian, forcefully, acquired, the, document, from, the, temple, of, vesta, and, it, became, a, useful, tool, in, the, propaganda, war, against, antony, and, cleopatra, octavian, highlighted, parts, of, the, will, such, as, caesarion, being, named, heir, to, caesar, that, the, donations, of, alexandria, were, legal, that, antony, should, be, buried, alongside, cleopatra, in, egypt, instead, of, rome, and, that, alexandria, would, be, made, the, new, capital, of, the, roman, republic, in, a, show, of, loyalty, to, rome, octavian, decided, to, begin, construction, of, his, own, mausoleum, at, the, campus, martius, octavian, s, legal, standing, was, also, improved, by, being, elected, consul, in, 31, bc, with, antony, s, will, made, public, octavian, had, his, casus, belli, and, rome, declared, war, on, cleopatra, not, antony, the, legal, argument, for, war, was, based, less, on, cleopatra, s, territorial, acquisitions, with, former, roman, territories, ruled, by, her, children, with, antony, and, more, on, the, fact, that, she, was, providing, military, support, to, a, private, citizen, now, that, antony, s, triumviral, authority, had, expired, antony, and, cleopatra, had, a, larger, fleet, than, octavian, but, the, crews, of, antony, and, cleopatra, s, navy, were, not, all, well, trained, some, of, them, perhaps, from, merchant, vessels, whereas, octavian, had, a, fully, professional, force, antony, wanted, to, cross, the, adriatic, sea, and, blockade, octavian, at, either, tarentum, or, brundisium, but, cleopatra, concerned, primarily, with, defending, egypt, overrode, the, decision, to, attack, italy, directly, antony, and, cleopatra, set, up, their, winter, headquarters, at, patrai, in, greece, and, by, the, spring, of, 31, bc, they, had, moved, to, actium, on, the, southern, side, of, the, ambracian, gulf, cleopatra, and, antony, had, the, support, of, various, allied, kings, but, cleopatra, had, already, been, in, conflict, with, herod, and, an, earthquake, in, judea, provided, him, with, an, excuse, to, be, absent, from, the, campaign, they, also, lost, the, support, of, malichus, i, which, would, prove, to, have, strategic, consequences, antony, and, cleopatra, lost, several, skirmishes, against, octavian, around, actium, during, the, summer, of, 31, bc, while, defections, to, octavian, s, camp, continued, including, antony, s, long, time, companion, dellius, and, the, allied, kings, amyntas, of, galatia, and, deiotaros, of, paphlagonia, while, some, in, antony, s, camp, suggested, abandoning, the, naval, conflict, to, retreat, inland, cleopatra, urged, for, a, naval, confrontation, to, keep, octavian, s, fleet, away, from, egypt, on, 2, september, 31, bc, the, naval, forces, of, octavian, led, by, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, met, those, of, antony, and, cleopatra, at, the, battle, of, actium, cleopatra, aboard, her, flagship, the, antonias, commanded, 60, ships, at, the, mouth, of, the, ambracian, gulf, at, the, rear, of, the, fleet, in, what, was, likely, a, move, by, antony, s, officers, to, marginalize, her, during, the, battle, antony, had, ordered, that, their, ships, should, have, sails, on, board, for, a, better, chance, to, pursue, or, flee, from, the, enemy, which, cleopatra, ever, concerned, about, defending, egypt, used, to, swiftly, move, through, the, area, of, major, combat, in, a, strategic, withdrawal, to, the, peloponnese, burstein, writes, that, partisan, roman, writers, would, later, accuse, cleopatra, of, cowardly, deserting, antony, but, their, original, intention, of, keeping, their, sails, on, board, may, have, been, to, break, the, blockade, and, salvage, as, much, of, their, fleet, as, possible, antony, followed, cleopatra, and, boarded, her, ship, identified, by, its, distinctive, purple, sails, as, the, two, escaped, the, battle, and, headed, for, tainaron, antony, reportedly, avoided, cleopatra, during, this, three, day, voyage, until, her, ladies, in, waiting, at, tainaron, urged, him, to, speak, with, her, the, battle, of, actium, raged, on, without, cleopatra, and, antony, until, the, morning, of, 3, september, and, was, followed, by, massive, defections, of, officers, troops, and, allied, kings, to, octavian, s, side, while, octavian, occupied, athens, antony, and, cleopatra, landed, at, paraitonion, in, egypt, the, couple, then, went, their, separate, ways, antony, to, cyrene, to, raise, more, troops, and, cleopatra, to, the, harbor, at, alexandria, in, an, attempt, to, mislead, the, oppositional, party, and, portray, the, activities, in, greece, as, a, victory, she, was, afraid, that, news, about, the, outcome, of, the, battle, of, actium, would, lead, to, a, rebellion, it, is, uncertain, whether, or, not, at, this, time, she, actually, executed, artavasdes, ii, and, sent, his, head, to, his, rival, artavasdes, i, of, media, atropatene, in, an, attempt, to, strike, an, alliance, with, him, lucius, pinarius, mark, antony, s, appointed, governor, of, cyrene, received, word, that, octavian, had, won, the, battle, of, actium, before, antony, s, messengers, could, arrive, at, his, court, pinarius, had, these, messengers, executed, and, then, defected, to, octavian, s, side, surrendering, to, him, the, four, legions, under, his, command, that, antony, desired, to, obtain, antony, nearly, committed, suicide, after, hearing, news, of, this, but, was, stopped, by, his, staff, officers, in, alexandria, he, built, a, reclusive, cottage, on, the, island, of, pharos, that, he, nicknamed, the, timoneion, after, the, philosopher, timon, of, athens, who, was, famous, for, his, cynicism, and, misanthropy, herod, who, had, personally, advised, antony, after, the, battle, of, actium, that, he, should, betray, cleopatra, traveled, to, rhodes, to, meet, octavian, and, resign, his, kingship, out, of, loyalty, to, antony, octavian, was, impressed, by, his, speech, and, sense, of, loyalty, so, he, allowed, him, to, maintain, his, position, in, judea, further, isolating, antony, and, cleopatra, cleopatra, perhaps, started, to, view, antony, as, a, liability, by, the, late, summer, of, 31, bc, when, she, prepared, to, leave, egypt, to, her, son, caesarion, cleopatra, planned, to, relinquish, her, throne, to, him, take, her, fleet, from, the, mediterranean, into, the, red, sea, and, then, set, sail, to, a, foreign, port, perhaps, in, india, where, she, could, spend, time, recuperating, however, these, plans, were, ultimately, abandoned, when, malichus, i, as, advised, by, octavian, s, governor, of, syria, quintus, didius, managed, to, burn, cleopatra, s, fleet, in, revenge, for, his, losses, in, a, war, with, herod, that, cleopatra, had, largely, initiated, cleopatra, had, no, other, option, but, to, stay, in, egypt, and, negotiate, with, octavian, although, most, likely, later, pro, octavian, propaganda, it, was, reported, that, at, this, time, cleopatra, started, testing, the, strengths, of, various, poisons, on, prisoners, and, even, her, own, servants, cleopatra, had, caesarion, enter, into, the, ranks, of, the, ephebi, which, along, with, reliefs, on, a, stele, from, koptos, dated, 21, september, 31, bc, demonstrated, that, cleopatra, was, now, grooming, her, son, to, become, the, sole, ruler, of, egypt, in, a, show, of, solidarity, antony, also, had, marcus, antonius, antyllus, his, son, with, fulvia, enter, the, ephebi, at, the, same, time, separate, messages, and, envoys, from, antony, and, cleopatra, were, then, sent, to, octavian, still, stationed, at, rhodes, although, octavian, seems, to, have, replied, only, to, cleopatra, cleopatra, requested, that, her, children, should, inherit, egypt, and, that, antony, should, be, allowed, to, live, in, exile, in, egypt, offered, octavian, money, in, the, future, and, immediately, sent, him, lavish, gifts, octavian, sent, his, diplomat, thyrsos, to, cleopatra, after, she, threatened, to, burn, herself, and, vast, amounts, of, her, treasure, within, a, tomb, already, under, construction, thyrsos, advised, her, to, kill, antony, so, that, her, life, would, be, spared, but, when, antony, suspected, foul, intent, he, had, this, diplomat, flogged, and, sent, back, to, octavian, without, a, deal, after, lengthy, negotiations, that, ultimately, produced, no, results, octavian, set, out, to, invade, egypt, in, the, spring, of, 30, bc, stopping, at, ptolemais, in, phoenicia, where, his, new, ally, herod, provided, his, army, with, fresh, supplies, octavian, moved, south, and, swiftly, took, pelousion, while, cornelius, gallus, marching, eastward, from, cyrene, defeated, antony, s, forces, near, paraitonion, octavian, advanced, quickly, to, alexandria, but, antony, returned, and, won, a, small, victory, over, octavian, s, tired, troops, outside, the, city, s, hippodrome, however, on, 1, august, 30, bc, antony, s, naval, fleet, surrendered, to, octavian, followed, by, antony, s, cavalry, cleopatra, hid, herself, in, her, tomb, with, her, close, attendants, and, sent, a, message, to, antony, that, she, had, committed, suicide, in, despair, antony, responded, to, this, by, stabbing, himself, in, the, stomach, and, taking, his, own, life, at, age, 53, according, to, plutarch, he, was, still, dying, when, brought, to, cleopatra, at, her, tomb, telling, her, he, had, died, honorably, and, that, she, could, trust, octavian, s, companion, gaius, proculeius, over, anyone, else, in, his, entourage, it, was, proculeius, however, who, infiltrated, her, tomb, using, a, ladder, and, detained, the, queen, denying, her, the, ability, to, burn, herself, with, her, treasures, cleopatra, was, then, allowed, to, embalm, and, bury, antony, within, her, tomb, before, she, was, escorted, to, the, palace, octavian, entered, alexandria, occupied, the, palace, and, seized, cleopatra, s, three, youngest, children, when, she, met, with, octavian, cleopatra, told, him, bluntly, i, will, not, be, led, in, a, triumph, ancient, greek, romanized, ou, thriamb, usomai, according, to, livy, a, rare, recording, of, her, exact, words, octavian, promised, that, he, would, keep, her, alive, but, offered, no, explanation, about, his, future, plans, for, her, kingdom, when, a, spy, informed, her, that, octavian, planned, to, move, her, and, her, children, to, rome, in, three, days, she, prepared, for, suicide, as, she, had, no, intentions, of, being, paraded, in, a, roman, triumph, like, her, sister, arsinoe, iv, it, is, unclear, if, cleopatra, s, suicide, on, 10, august, 30, bc, at, age, 39, took, place, within, the, palace, or, her, tomb, it, is, said, she, was, accompanied, by, her, servants, eiras, and, charmion, who, also, took, their, own, lives, octavian, was, said, to, have, been, angered, by, this, outcome, but, had, cleopatra, buried, in, royal, fashion, next, to, antony, in, her, tomb, cleopatra, s, physician, olympos, did, not, explain, her, cause, of, death, although, the, popular, belief, is, that, she, allowed, an, asp, or, egyptian, cobra, to, bite, and, poison, her, plutarch, relates, this, tale, but, then, suggests, an, implement, kn, stis, lit, spine, cheese, grater, was, used, to, introduce, the, toxin, by, scratching, while, dio, says, that, she, injected, the, poison, with, a, needle, bel, n, and, strabo, argued, for, an, ointment, of, some, kind, no, venomous, snake, was, found, with, her, body, but, she, did, have, tiny, puncture, wounds, on, her, arm, that, could, have, been, caused, by, a, needle, cleopatra, decided, in, her, last, moments, to, send, caesarion, away, to, upper, egypt, perhaps, with, plans, to, flee, to, kushite, nubia, ethiopia, or, india, caesarion, now, ptolemy, xv, would, reign, for, a, mere, 18, days, until, executed, on, the, orders, of, octavian, on, 29, august, 30, bc, after, returning, to, alexandria, under, the, false, pretense, that, octavian, would, allow, him, to, be, king, octavian, was, convinced, by, the, advice, of, the, philosopher, arius, didymus, that, there, was, room, for, only, one, caesar, in, the, world, with, the, fall, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, the, roman, province, of, egypt, was, established, marking, the, end, of, the, hellenistic, period, in, january, of, 27, bc, octavian, was, renamed, augustus, the, revered, and, amassed, constitutional, powers, that, established, him, as, the, first, roman, emperor, inaugurating, the, principate, era, of, the, roman, empire, following, the, tradition, of, macedonian, rulers, cleopatra, ruled, egypt, and, other, territories, such, as, cyprus, as, an, absolute, monarch, serving, as, the, sole, lawgiver, of, her, kingdom, she, was, the, chief, religious, authority, in, her, realm, presiding, over, religious, ceremonies, dedicated, to, the, deities, of, both, the, egyptian, and, greek, polytheistic, faiths, she, oversaw, the, construction, of, various, temples, to, egyptian, and, greek, gods, a, synagogue, for, the, jews, in, egypt, and, even, built, the, caesareum, of, alexandria, dedicated, to, the, cult, worship, of, her, patron, and, lover, julius, caesar, cleopatra, was, directly, involved, in, the, administrative, affairs, of, her, domain, tackling, crises, such, as, famine, by, ordering, royal, granaries, to, distribute, food, to, the, starving, populace, during, a, drought, at, the, beginning, of, her, reign, although, the, command, economy, that, she, managed, was, more, of, an, ideal, than, a, reality, the, government, attempted, to, impose, price, controls, tariffs, and, state, monopolies, for, certain, goods, fixed, exchange, rates, for, foreign, currencies, and, rigid, laws, forcing, peasant, farmers, to, stay, in, their, villages, during, planting, and, harvesting, seasons, apparent, financial, troubles, led, cleopatra, to, debase, her, coinage, which, included, silver, and, bronze, currencies, but, no, gold, coins, like, those, of, some, of, her, distant, ptolemaic, predecessors, after, her, suicide, cleopatra, s, three, surviving, children, cleopatra, selene, ii, alexander, helios, and, ptolemy, philadelphus, were, sent, to, rome, with, octavian, s, sister, octavia, the, younger, a, former, wife, of, their, father, as, their, guardian, cleopatra, selene, ii, and, alexander, helios, were, present, in, the, roman, triumph, of, octavian, in, 29, bc, the, fates, of, alexander, helios, and, ptolemy, philadelphus, are, unknown, after, this, point, octavia, arranged, the, betrothal, of, cleopatra, selene, ii, to, juba, ii, son, of, juba, i, whose, north, african, kingdom, of, numidia, had, been, turned, into, a, roman, province, in, 46, bc, by, julius, caesar, due, to, juba, i, s, support, of, pompey, the, emperor, augustus, installed, juba, ii, and, cleopatra, selene, ii, after, their, wedding, in, 25, bc, as, the, new, rulers, of, mauretania, where, they, transformed, the, old, carthaginian, city, of, iol, into, their, new, capital, renamed, caesarea, mauretaniae, modern, cherchell, algeria, cleopatra, selene, ii, imported, many, important, scholars, artists, and, advisers, from, her, mother, s, royal, court, in, alexandria, to, serve, her, in, caesarea, now, permeated, in, hellenistic, greek, culture, she, also, named, her, son, ptolemy, of, mauretania, in, honor, of, their, ptolemaic, dynastic, heritage, cleopatra, selene, ii, died, c, 5, bc, and, when, juba, ii, died, in, 23, 24, ad, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ptolemy, however, ptolemy, was, eventually, executed, by, the, roman, emperor, caligula, in, 40, ad, perhaps, under, the, pretense, that, ptolemy, had, unlawfully, minted, his, own, royal, coinage, and, utilized, regalia, reserved, for, the, roman, emperor, ptolemy, of, mauretania, was, the, last, known, monarch, of, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, although, queen, zenobia, of, the, short, lived, palmyrene, empire, during, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, claimed, descent, from, cleopatra, a, cult, dedicated, to, cleopatra, still, existed, as, late, as, 373, ad, when, petesenufe, an, egyptian, scribe, of, the, book, of, isis, explained, that, he, overlaid, the, figure, of, cleopatra, with, gold, although, almost, 50, ancient, works, of, roman, historiography, mention, cleopatra, these, often, include, only, terse, accounts, of, the, battle, of, actium, her, suicide, and, augustan, propaganda, about, her, personal, deficiencies, despite, not, being, a, biography, of, cleopatra, the, life, of, antonius, written, by, plutarch, in, the, 1st, century, ad, provides, the, most, thorough, surviving, account, of, cleopatra, s, life, plutarch, lived, a, century, after, cleopatra, but, relied, on, primary, sources, such, as, philotas, of, amphissa, who, had, access, to, the, ptolemaic, royal, palace, cleopatra, s, personal, physician, named, olympos, and, quintus, dellius, a, close, confidant, of, mark, antony, and, cleopatra, plutarch, s, work, included, both, the, augustan, view, of, cleopatra, which, became, canonical, for, his, period, as, well, as, sources, outside, of, this, tradition, such, as, eyewitness, reports, the, jewish, roman, historian, josephus, writing, in, the, 1st, century, ad, provides, valuable, information, on, the, life, of, cleopatra, via, her, diplomatic, relationship, with, herod, the, great, however, this, work, relies, largely, on, herod, s, memoirs, and, the, biased, account, of, nicolaus, of, damascus, the, tutor, of, cleopatra, s, children, in, alexandria, before, he, moved, to, judea, to, serve, as, an, adviser, and, chronicler, at, herod, s, court, the, roman, history, published, by, the, official, and, historian, cassius, dio, in, the, early, 3rd, century, ad, while, failing, to, fully, comprehend, the, complexities, of, the, late, hellenistic, world, nevertheless, provides, a, continuous, history, of, the, era, of, cleopatra, s, reign, cleopatra, is, barely, mentioned, in, de, bello, alexandrino, the, memoirs, of, an, unknown, staff, officer, who, served, under, caesar, the, writings, of, cicero, who, knew, her, personally, provide, an, unflattering, portrait, of, cleopatra, the, augustan, period, authors, virgil, horace, propertius, and, ovid, perpetuated, the, negative, views, of, cleopatra, approved, by, the, ruling, roman, regime, although, virgil, established, the, idea, of, cleopatra, as, a, figure, of, romance, and, epic, melodrama, horace, also, viewed, cleopatra, s, suicide, as, a, positive, choice, an, idea, that, found, acceptance, by, the, late, middle, ages, with, geoffrey, chaucer, the, historians, strabo, velleius, valerius, maximus, pliny, the, elder, and, appian, while, not, offering, accounts, as, full, as, plutarch, josephus, or, dio, provided, some, details, of, her, life, that, had, not, survived, in, other, historical, records, inscriptions, on, contemporary, ptolemaic, coinage, and, some, egyptian, papyrus, documents, demonstrate, cleopatra, s, point, of, view, but, this, material, is, very, limited, in, comparison, to, roman, literary, works, the, fragmentary, libyka, commissioned, by, cleopatra, s, son, in, law, juba, ii, provides, a, glimpse, at, a, possible, body, of, historiographic, material, that, supported, cleopatra, s, perspective, cleopatra, s, gender, has, perhaps, led, to, her, depiction, as, a, minor, if, not, insignificant, figure, in, ancient, medieval, and, even, modern, historiography, about, ancient, egypt, and, the, greco, roman, world, for, instance, the, historian, ronald, syme, asserted, that, she, was, of, little, importance, to, caesar, and, that, the, propaganda, of, octavian, magnified, her, importance, to, an, excessive, degree, although, the, common, view, of, cleopatra, was, one, of, a, prolific, seductress, she, had, only, two, known, sexual, partners, caesar, and, antony, the, two, most, prominent, romans, of, the, time, period, who, were, most, likely, to, ensure, the, survival, of, her, dynasty, plutarch, described, cleopatra, as, having, had, a, stronger, personality, and, charming, wit, than, physical, beauty, cleopatra, was, depicted, in, various, ancient, works, of, art, in, the, egyptian, as, well, as, hellenistic, greek, and, roman, styles, surviving, works, include, statues, busts, reliefs, and, minted, coins, as, well, as, ancient, carved, cameos, such, as, one, depicting, cleopatra, and, antony, in, hellenistic, style, now, in, the, altes, museum, berlin, contemporary, images, of, cleopatra, were, produced, both, in, and, outside, of, ptolemaic, egypt, for, instance, there, was, once, a, large, gilded, bronze, statue, of, cleopatra, inside, the, temple, of, venus, genetrix, in, rome, the, first, time, that, a, living, person, had, their, statue, placed, next, to, that, of, a, deity, in, a, roman, temple, it, was, erected, there, by, caesar, and, remained, in, the, temple, at, least, until, the, 3rd, century, ad, its, preservation, perhaps, owing, to, caesar, s, patronage, although, augustus, did, not, remove, or, destroy, artworks, in, alexandria, depicting, cleopatra, a, life, sized, roman, style, statue, of, cleopatra, was, found, near, the, tomba, di, nerone, rome, along, the, via, cassia, and, is, now, housed, in, the, museo, pio, clementino, part, of, the, vatican, museums, plutarch, in, his, life, of, antonius, said, that, the, public, statues, of, antony, were, torn, down, by, augustus, but, those, of, cleopatra, were, preserved, following, her, death, thanks, to, her, friend, archibius, paying, the, emperor, 2, 000, talents, to, dissuade, him, from, destroying, hers, since, the, 1950s, scholars, have, debated, whether, or, not, the, esquiline, venus, discovered, in, 1874, on, the, esquiline, hill, in, rome, and, housed, in, the, palazzo, dei, conservatori, of, the, capitoline, museums, is, a, depiction, of, cleopatra, based, on, the, statue, s, hairstyle, and, facial, features, apparent, royal, diadem, worn, over, the, head, and, the, uraeus, egyptian, cobra, wrapped, around, the, base, detractors, of, this, theory, argue, that, the, face, in, this, statue, is, thinner, than, the, face, on, the, berlin, portrait, and, assert, that, it, was, unlikely, she, would, be, depicted, as, the, naked, goddess, venus, or, the, greek, aphrodite, however, she, was, depicted, in, an, egyptian, statue, as, the, goddess, isis, while, some, of, her, coinage, depicts, her, as, venus, aphrodite, she, also, dressed, as, aphrodite, when, meeting, antony, at, tarsos, the, esquiline, venus, is, generally, thought, to, be, a, mid, 1st, century, ad, roman, copy, of, a, 1st, century, bc, greek, original, from, the, school, of, pasiteles, surviving, coinage, of, cleopatra, s, reign, include, specimens, from, every, regnal, year, from, 51, to, 30, bc, cleopatra, the, only, ptolemaic, queen, to, issue, coins, on, her, own, behalf, almost, certainly, inspired, her, partner, caesar, to, become, the, first, living, roman, to, present, his, portrait, on, his, own, coins, cleopatra, was, the, first, foreign, queen, to, have, her, image, appear, on, roman, currency, coins, dated, to, the, period, of, her, marriage, to, antony, which, also, bear, his, image, portray, the, queen, as, having, a, very, similar, aquiline, nose, and, prominent, chin, as, that, of, her, husband, these, similar, facial, features, followed, an, artistic, convention, that, represented, the, mutually, observed, harmony, of, a, royal, couple, her, strong, almost, masculine, facial, features, in, these, particular, coins, are, strikingly, different, from, the, smoother, softer, and, perhaps, idealized, sculpted, images, of, her, in, either, the, egyptian, or, hellenistic, styles, her, masculine, facial, features, on, minted, currency, are, similar, to, that, of, her, father, ptolemy, xii, auletes, and, perhaps, also, to, those, of, her, ptolemaic, ancestor, arsinoe, ii, 316, 260, bc, and, even, depictions, of, earlier, queens, such, as, hatshepsut, and, nefertiti, it, is, likely, due, to, political, expediency, that, antony, s, visage, was, made, to, conform, not, only, to, hers, but, also, to, those, of, her, macedonian, greek, ancestors, who, founded, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, to, familiarize, himself, to, her, subjects, as, a, legitimate, member, of, the, royal, house, the, inscriptions, on, the, coins, are, written, in, greek, but, also, in, the, nominative, case, of, roman, coins, rather, than, the, genitive, case, of, greek, coins, in, addition, to, having, the, letters, placed, in, a, circular, fashion, along, the, edges, of, the, coin, instead, of, across, it, horizontally, or, vertically, as, was, customary, for, greek, ones, these, facets, of, their, coinage, represent, the, synthesis, of, roman, and, hellenistic, culture, and, perhaps, also, a, statement, to, their, subjects, however, ambiguous, to, modern, scholars, about, the, superiority, of, either, antony, or, cleopatra, over, the, other, diana, kleiner, argues, that, cleopatra, in, one, of, her, coins, minted, with, the, dual, image, of, her, husband, antony, made, herself, more, masculine, looking, than, other, portraits, and, more, like, an, acceptable, roman, client, queen, than, a, hellenistic, ruler, cleopatra, had, actually, achieved, this, masculine, look, in, coinage, predating, her, affair, with, antony, such, as, the, coins, struck, at, the, ascalon, mint, during, her, brief, period, of, exile, to, syria, and, the, levant, which, joann, fletcher, explains, as, her, attempt, to, appear, like, her, father, and, as, a, legitimate, successor, to, a, male, ptolemaic, ruler, various, coins, such, as, a, silver, tetradrachm, minted, sometime, after, cleopatra, s, marriage, with, antony, in, 37, bc, depict, her, wearing, a, royal, diadem, and, a, melon, hairstyle, the, combination, of, this, hairstyle, with, a, diadem, is, also, featured, in, two, surviving, sculpted, marble, heads, this, hairstyle, with, hair, braided, back, into, a, bun, is, the, same, as, that, worn, by, her, ptolemaic, ancestors, arsinoe, ii, and, berenice, ii, in, their, own, coinage, after, her, visit, to, rome, in, 46, 44, bc, it, became, fashionable, for, roman, women, to, adopt, it, as, one, of, their, hairstyles, but, it, was, abandoned, for, a, more, modest, austere, look, during, the, conservative, rule, of, augustus, of, the, surviving, greco, roman, style, busts, and, heads, of, cleopatra, the, sculpture, known, as, the, berlin, cleopatra, located, in, the, antikensammlung, berlin, collection, at, the, altes, museum, possesses, her, full, nose, whereas, the, head, known, as, the, vatican, cleopatra, located, in, the, vatican, museums, is, damaged, with, a, missing, nose, both, the, berlin, cleopatra, and, vatican, cleopatra, have, royal, diadems, similar, facial, features, and, perhaps, once, resembled, the, face, of, her, bronze, statue, housed, in, the, temple, of, venus, genetrix, both, heads, are, dated, to, the, mid, 1st, century, bc, and, were, found, in, roman, villas, along, the, via, appia, in, italy, the, vatican, cleopatra, having, been, unearthed, in, the, villa, of, the, quintilii, francisco, pina, polo, writes, that, cleopatra, s, coinage, present, her, image, with, certainty, and, asserts, that, the, sculpted, portrait, of, the, berlin, head, is, confirmed, as, having, a, similar, profile, with, her, hair, pulled, back, into, a, bun, a, diadem, and, a, hooked, nose, a, third, sculpted, portrait, of, cleopatra, accepted, by, scholars, as, being, authentic, survives, at, the, archaeological, museum, of, cherchell, algeria, this, portrait, features, the, royal, diadem, and, similar, facial, features, as, the, berlin, and, vatican, heads, but, has, a, more, unique, hairstyle, and, may, actually, depict, cleopatra, selene, ii, daughter, of, cleopatra, a, possible, parian, marble, sculpture, of, cleopatra, wearing, a, vulture, headdress, in, egyptian, style, is, located, at, the, capitoline, museums, discovered, near, a, sanctuary, of, isis, in, rome, and, dated, to, the, 1st, century, bc, it, is, either, roman, or, hellenistic, egyptian, in, origin, other, possible, sculpted, depictions, of, cleopatra, include, one, in, the, british, museum, london, made, of, limestone, which, perhaps, only, depicts, a, woman, in, her, entourage, during, her, trip, to, rome, the, woman, in, this, portrait, has, facial, features, similar, to, others, including, the, pronounced, aquiline, nose, but, lacks, a, royal, diadem, and, sports, a, different, hairstyle, however, the, british, museum, head, once, belonging, to, a, full, statue, could, potentially, represent, cleopatra, at, a, different, stage, in, her, life, and, may, also, betray, an, effort, by, cleopatra, to, discard, the, use, of, royal, insignia, i, e, the, diadem, to, make, herself, more, appealing, to, the, citizens, of, republican, rome, duane, w, roller, speculates, that, the, british, museum, head, along, with, those, in, the, egyptian, museum, cairo, the, capitoline, museums, and, in, the, private, collection, of, maurice, nahmen, while, having, similar, facial, features, and, hairstyles, as, the, berlin, portrait, but, lacking, a, royal, diadem, most, likely, represent, members, of, the, royal, court, or, even, roman, women, imitating, cleopatra, s, popular, hairstyle, in, the, house, of, marcus, fabius, rufus, at, pompeii, italy, a, mid, 1st, century, bc, second, style, wall, painting, of, the, goddess, venus, holding, a, cupid, near, massive, temple, doors, is, most, likely, a, depiction, of, cleopatra, as, venus, genetrix, with, her, son, caesarion, the, commission, of, the, painting, most, likely, coincides, with, the, erection, of, the, temple, of, venus, genetrix, in, the, forum, of, caesar, in, september, 46, bc, where, caesar, had, a, gilded, statue, erected, depicting, cleopatra, this, statue, likely, formed, the, basis, of, her, depictions, in, both, sculpted, art, as, well, as, this, painting, at, pompeii, the, woman, in, the, painting, wears, a, royal, diadem, over, her, head, and, is, strikingly, similar, in, appearance, to, the, vatican, cleopatra, which, bears, possible, marks, on, the, marble, of, its, left, cheek, where, a, cupid, s, arm, may, have, been, torn, off, the, room, with, the, painting, was, walled, off, by, its, owner, perhaps, in, reaction, to, the, execution, of, caesarion, in, 30, bc, by, order, of, octavian, when, public, depictions, of, cleopatra, s, son, would, have, been, unfavorable, with, the, new, roman, regime, behind, her, golden, diadem, crowned, with, a, red, jewel, is, a, translucent, veil, with, crinkles, that, suggest, the, melon, hairstyle, favored, by, the, queen, her, ivory, white, skin, round, face, long, aquiline, nose, and, large, round, eyes, were, features, common, in, both, roman, and, ptolemaic, depictions, of, deities, roller, affirms, that, there, seems, little, doubt, that, this, is, a, depiction, of, cleopatra, and, caesarion, before, the, doors, of, the, temple, of, venus, in, the, forum, julium, and, as, such, it, becomes, the, only, extant, contemporary, painting, of, the, queen, another, painting, from, pompeii, dated, to, the, early, 1st, century, ad, and, located, in, the, house, of, giuseppe, ii, contains, a, possible, depiction, of, cleopatra, with, her, son, caesarion, both, wearing, royal, diadems, while, she, reclines, and, consumes, poison, in, an, act, of, suicide, the, painting, was, originally, thought, to, depict, the, carthaginian, noblewoman, sophonisba, who, toward, the, end, of, the, second, punic, war, 218, 201, bc, drank, poison, and, committed, suicide, at, the, behest, of, her, lover, masinissa, king, of, numidia, arguments, in, favor, of, it, depicting, cleopatra, include, the, strong, connection, of, her, house, with, that, of, the, numidian, royal, family, masinissa, and, ptolemy, viii, physcon, having, been, associates, and, cleopatra, s, own, daughter, marrying, the, numidian, prince, juba, ii, sophonisba, was, also, a, more, obscure, figure, when, the, painting, was, made, while, cleopatra, s, suicide, was, far, more, famous, an, asp, is, absent, from, the, painting, but, many, romans, held, the, view, that, she, received, poison, in, another, manner, than, a, venomous, snakebite, a, set, of, double, doors, on, the, rear, wall, of, the, painting, positioned, very, high, above, the, people, in, it, suggests, the, described, layout, of, cleopatra, s, tomb, in, alexandria, a, male, servant, holds, the, mouth, of, an, artificial, egyptian, crocodile, possibly, an, elaborate, tray, handle, while, another, man, standing, by, is, dressed, as, a, roman, in, 1818, a, now, lost, encaustic, painting, was, discovered, in, the, temple, of, serapis, at, hadrian, s, villa, near, tivoli, lazio, italy, that, depicted, cleopatra, committing, suicide, with, an, asp, biting, her, bare, chest, a, chemical, analysis, performed, in, 1822, confirmed, that, the, medium, for, the, painting, was, composed, of, one, third, wax, and, two, thirds, resin, the, thickness, of, the, painting, over, cleopatra, s, bare, flesh, and, her, drapery, were, reportedly, similar, to, the, paintings, of, the, fayum, mummy, portraits, a, steel, engraving, published, by, john, sartain, in, 1885, depicting, the, painting, as, described, in, the, archaeological, report, shows, cleopatra, wearing, authentic, clothing, and, jewelry, of, egypt, in, the, late, hellenistic, period, as, well, as, the, radiant, crown, of, the, ptolemaic, rulers, as, seen, in, their, portraits, on, various, coins, minted, during, their, respective, reigns, after, cleopatra, s, suicide, octavian, commissioned, a, painting, to, be, made, depicting, her, being, bitten, by, a, snake, parading, this, image, in, her, stead, during, his, triumphal, procession, in, rome, the, portrait, painting, of, cleopatra, s, death, was, perhaps, among, the, great, number, of, artworks, and, treasures, taken, from, rome, by, emperor, hadrian, to, decorate, his, private, villa, where, it, was, found, in, an, egyptian, temple, a, roman, panel, painting, from, herculaneum, italy, dated, to, the, 1st, century, ad, possibly, depicts, cleopatra, in, it, she, wears, a, royal, diadem, red, or, reddish, brown, hair, pulled, back, into, a, bun, pearl, studded, hairpins, and, earrings, with, ball, shaped, pendants, the, white, skin, of, her, face, and, neck, set, against, a, stark, black, background, her, hair, and, facial, features, are, similar, to, those, in, the, sculpted, berlin, and, vatican, portraits, as, well, as, her, coinage, a, highly, similar, painted, bust, of, a, woman, with, a, blue, headband, in, the, house, of, the, orchard, at, pompeii, features, egyptian, style, imagery, such, as, a, greek, style, sphinx, and, may, have, been, created, by, the, same, artist, the, portland, vase, a, roman, cameo, glass, vase, dated, to, the, augustan, period, and, now, in, the, british, museum, includes, a, possible, depiction, of, cleopatra, with, antony, in, this, interpretation, cleopatra, can, be, seen, grasping, antony, and, drawing, him, toward, her, while, a, serpent, i, e, the, asp, rises, between, her, legs, eros, floats, above, and, anton, the, alleged, ancestor, of, the, antonian, family, looks, on, in, despair, as, his, descendant, antony, is, led, to, his, doom, the, other, side, of, the, vase, perhaps, contains, a, scene, of, octavia, abandoned, by, her, husband, antony, but, watched, over, by, her, brother, the, emperor, augustus, the, vase, would, thus, have, been, created, no, earlier, than, 35, bc, when, antony, sent, his, wife, octavia, back, to, italy, and, stayed, with, cleopatra, in, alexandria, the, bust, of, cleopatra, in, the, royal, ontario, museum, represents, a, bust, of, cleopatra, in, the, egyptian, style, dated, to, the, mid, 1st, century, bc, it, is, perhaps, the, earliest, depiction, of, cleopatra, as, both, a, goddess, and, ruling, pharaoh, of, egypt, the, sculpture, also, has, pronounced, eyes, that, share, similarities, with, roman, copies, of, ptolemaic, sculpted, works, of, art, the, dendera, temple, complex, near, dendera, egypt, contains, egyptian, style, carved, relief, images, along, the, exterior, walls, of, the, temple, of, hathor, depicting, cleopatra, and, her, young, son, caesarion, as, a, grown, adult, and, ruling, pharaoh, making, offerings, to, the, gods, augustus, had, his, name, inscribed, there, following, the, death, of, cleopatra, a, large, ptolemaic, black, basalt, statue, measuring, 104, centimetres, 41, in, in, height, now, in, the, hermitage, museum, saint, petersburg, is, thought, to, represent, arsinoe, ii, wife, of, ptolemy, ii, but, recent, analysis, has, indicated, that, it, could, depict, her, descendant, cleopatra, due, to, the, three, uraei, adorning, her, headdress, an, increase, from, the, two, used, by, arsinoe, ii, to, symbolize, her, rule, over, lower, and, upper, egypt, the, woman, in, the, basalt, statue, also, holds, a, divided, double, cornucopia, dikeras, which, can, be, seen, on, coins, of, both, arsinoe, ii, and, cleopatra, in, his, kleopatra, und, die, caesaren, 2006, bernard, andreae, contends, that, this, basalt, statue, like, other, idealized, egyptian, portraits, of, the, queen, does, not, contain, realistic, facial, features, and, hence, adds, little, to, the, knowledge, of, her, appearance, adrian, goldsworthy, writes, that, despite, these, representations, in, the, traditional, egyptian, style, cleopatra, would, have, dressed, as, a, native, only, perhaps, for, certain, rites, and, instead, would, usually, dress, as, a, greek, monarch, which, would, include, the, greek, headband, seen, in, her, greco, roman, busts, in, modern, times, cleopatra, has, become, an, icon, of, popular, culture, a, reputation, shaped, by, theatrical, representations, dating, back, to, the, renaissance, as, well, as, paintings, and, films, this, material, largely, surpasses, the, scope, and, size, of, existent, historiographic, literature, about, her, from, classical, antiquity, and, has, made, a, greater, impact, on, the, general, public, s, view, of, cleopatra, than, the, latter, the, 14th, century, english, poet, geoffrey, chaucer, in, the, legend, of, good, women, contextualized, cleopatra, for, the, christian, world, of, the, middle, ages, his, depiction, of, cleopatra, and, antony, her, shining, knight, engaged, in, courtly, love, has, been, interpreted, in, modern, times, as, being, either, playful, or, misogynistic, satire, chaucer, highlighted, cleopatra, s, relationships, with, only, two, men, as, hardly, the, life, of, a, seductress, and, wrote, his, works, partly, in, reaction, to, the, negative, depiction, of, cleopatra, in, de, mulieribus, claris, and, de, casibus, virorum, illustrium, latin, works, by, the, 14th, century, italian, poet, giovanni, boccaccio, the, renaissance, humanist, bernardino, cacciante, in, his, 1504, libretto, apologetico, delle, donne, was, the, first, italian, to, defend, the, reputation, of, cleopatra, and, criticize, the, perceived, moralizing, and, misogyny, in, boccaccio, s, works, works, of, islamic, historiography, written, in, arabic, covered, the, reign, of, cleopatra, such, as, the, 10th, century, meadows, of, gold, by, al, masudi, although, his, work, erroneously, claimed, that, octavian, died, soon, after, cleopatra, s, suicide, cleopatra, appeared, in, miniatures, for, illuminated, manuscripts, such, as, a, depiction, of, her, and, antony, lying, in, a, gothic, style, tomb, by, the, boucicaut, master, in, 1409, in, the, visual, arts, the, sculpted, depiction, of, cleopatra, as, a, free, standing, nude, figure, committing, suicide, began, with, the, 16th, century, sculptors, bartolommeo, bandinelli, and, alessandro, vittoria, early, prints, depicting, cleopatra, include, designs, by, the, renaissance, artists, raphael, and, michelangelo, as, well, as, 15th, century, woodcuts, in, illustrated, editions, of, boccaccio, s, works, in, the, performing, arts, the, death, of, elizabeth, i, of, england, in, 1603, and, the, german, publication, in, 1606, of, alleged, letters, of, cleopatra, inspired, samuel, daniel, to, alter, and, republish, his, 1594, play, cleopatra, in, 1607, he, was, followed, by, william, shakespeare, whose, antony, and, cleopatra, largely, based, on, plutarch, was, first, performed, in, 1608, and, provided, a, somewhat, salacious, view, of, cleopatra, in, stark, contrast, to, england, s, own, virgin, queen, cleopatra, was, also, featured, in, operas, such, as, george, frideric, handel, s, 1724, giulio, cesare, in, egitto, which, portrayed, the, love, affair, of, caesar, and, cleopatra, domenico, cimarosa, wrote, cleopatra, on, a, similar, subject, in, 1789, in, victorian, britain, cleopatra, was, highly, associated, with, many, aspects, of, ancient, egyptian, culture, and, her, image, was, used, to, market, various, household, products, including, oil, lamps, lithographs, postcards, and, cigarettes, fictional, novels, such, as, h, rider, haggard, s, cleopatra, 1889, and, th, ophile, gautier, s, one, of, cleopatra, s, nights, 1838, depicted, the, queen, as, a, sensual, and, mystic, easterner, while, the, egyptologist, georg, ebers, s, cleopatra, 1894, was, more, grounded, in, historical, accuracy, the, french, dramatist, victorien, sardou, and, irish, playwright, george, bernard, shaw, produced, plays, about, cleopatra, while, burlesque, shows, such, as, f, c, burnand, s, antony, and, cleopatra, offered, satirical, depictions, of, the, queen, connecting, her, and, the, environment, she, lived, in, with, the, modern, age, shakespeare, s, antony, and, cleopatra, was, considered, canonical, by, the, victorian, era, its, popularity, led, to, the, perception, that, the, 1885, painting, by, lawrence, alma, tadema, depicted, the, meeting, of, antony, and, cleopatra, on, her, pleasure, barge, in, tarsus, although, alma, tadema, revealed, in, a, private, letter, that, it, depicts, a, subsequent, meeting, of, theirs, in, alexandria, also, based, on, shakespeare, s, play, was, samuel, barber, s, opera, antony, and, cleopatra, 1966, commissioned, for, the, opening, of, the, metropolitan, opera, house, in, his, unfinished, 1825, short, story, the, egyptian, nights, alexander, pushkin, popularized, the, claims, of, the, 4th, century, roman, historian, aurelius, victor, previously, largely, ignored, that, cleopatra, had, prostituted, herself, to, men, who, paid, for, sex, with, their, lives, cleopatra, also, became, appreciated, outside, the, western, world, and, middle, east, as, the, qing, dynasty, chinese, scholar, yan, fu, wrote, an, extensive, biography, of, her, georges, m, li, s, s, robbing, cleopatra, s, tomb, french, cl, op, tre, an, 1899, french, silent, horror, film, was, the, first, film, to, depict, the, character, of, cleopatra, hollywood, films, of, the, 20th, century, were, influenced, by, earlier, victorian, media, which, helped, to, shape, the, character, of, cleopatra, played, by, theda, bara, in, cleopatra, 1917, claudette, colbert, in, cleopatra, 1934, and, elizabeth, taylor, in, cleopatra, 1963, in, addition, to, her, portrayal, as, a, vampire, queen, bara, s, cleopatra, also, incorporated, tropes, familiar, from, 19th, century, orientalist, painting, such, as, despotic, behavior, mixed, with, dangerous, and, overt, female, sexuality, colbert, s, character, of, cleopatra, served, as, a, glamour, model, for, selling, egyptian, themed, products, in, department, stores, in, the, 1930s, targeting, female, moviegoers, in, preparation, for, the, film, starring, taylor, as, cleopatra, women, s, magazines, of, the, early, 1960s, advertised, how, to, use, makeup, clothes, jewelry, and, hairstyles, to, achieve, the, egyptian, look, similar, to, the, queens, cleopatra, and, nefertiti, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, there, were, forty, three, films, two, hundred, plays, and, novels, forty, five, operas, and, five, ballets, associated, with, cleopatra, whereas, myths, about, cleopatra, persist, in, popular, media, important, aspects, of, her, career, go, largely, unnoticed, such, as, her, command, of, naval, forces, and, administrative, acts, publications, on, ancient, greek, medicine, attributed, to, her, are, likely, to, be, the, work, of, a, physician, by, the, same, name, writing, in, the, late, first, century, ad, ingrid, d, rowland, who, highlights, that, the, berenice, called, cleopatra, cited, by, the, 3rd, or, 4th, century, female, roman, physician, metrodora, was, likely, conflated, by, medieval, scholars, as, referring, to, cleopatra, only, fragments, exist, of, these, medical, and, cosmetic, writings, such, as, those, preserved, by, galen, including, remedies, for, hair, disease, baldness, and, dandruff, along, with, a, list, of, weights, and, measures, for, pharmacological, purposes, a, tius, of, amida, attributed, a, recipe, for, perfumed, soap, to, cleopatra, while, paul, of, aegina, preserved, alleged, instructions, of, hers, for, dyeing, and, curling, hair, cleopatra, belonged, to, the, macedonian, greek, dynasty, of, the, ptolemies, their, european, origins, tracing, back, to, northern, greece, through, her, father, ptolemy, xii, auletes, she, was, a, descendant, of, two, prominent, companions, of, alexander, the, great, of, macedon, the, general, ptolemy, i, soter, founder, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, of, egypt, and, seleucus, i, nicator, the, macedonian, greek, founder, of, the, seleucid, empire, of, west, asia, while, cleopatra, s, paternal, line, can, be, traced, the, identity, of, her, mother, is, uncertain, she, was, presumably, the, daughter, of, cleopatra, v, tryphaena, the, sister, wife, of, ptolemy, xii, who, had, previously, given, birth, to, their, daughter, berenice, iv, cleopatra, i, syra, was, the, only, member, of, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, known, for, certain, to, have, introduced, some, non, greek, ancestry, her, mother, laodice, iii, was, a, daughter, born, to, king, mithridates, ii, of, pontus, a, persian, of, the, mithridatic, dynasty, and, his, wife, laodice, who, had, a, mixed, greek, persian, heritage, cleopatra, i, syra, s, father, antiochus, iii, the, great, was, a, descendant, of, queen, apama, the, sogdian, iranian, wife, of, seleucus, i, nicator, it, is, generally, believed, that, the, ptolemies, did, not, intermarry, with, native, egyptians, michael, grant, asserts, that, there, is, only, one, known, egyptian, mistress, of, a, ptolemy, and, no, known, egyptian, wife, of, a, ptolemy, further, arguing, that, cleopatra, probably, did, not, have, any, egyptian, ancestry, and, would, have, described, herself, as, greek, stacy, schiff, writes, that, cleopatra, was, a, macedonian, greek, with, some, persian, ancestry, arguing, that, it, was, rare, for, the, ptolemies, to, have, an, egyptian, mistress, duane, w, roller, speculates, that, cleopatra, could, have, been, the, daughter, of, a, theoretical, half, macedonian, greek, half, egyptian, woman, from, memphis, in, northern, egypt, belonging, to, a, family, of, priests, dedicated, to, ptah, a, hypothesis, not, generally, accepted, in, scholarship, but, contends, that, whatever, cleopatra, s, ancestry, she, valued, her, greek, ptolemaic, heritage, the, most, ernle, bradford, writes, that, cleopatra, challenged, rome, not, as, an, egyptian, woman, but, as, a, civilized, greek, claims, that, cleopatra, was, an, illegitimate, child, never, appeared, in, roman, propaganda, against, her, strabo, was, the, only, ancient, historian, who, claimed, that, ptolemy, xii, s, children, born, after, berenice, iv, including, cleopatra, were, illegitimate, cleopatra, v, or, vi, was, expelled, from, the, court, of, ptolemy, xii, in, late, 69, bc, a, few, months, after, the, birth, of, cleopatra, while, ptolemy, xii, s, three, younger, children, were, all, born, during, the, absence, of, his, wife, the, high, degree, of, inbreeding, among, the, ptolemies, is, also, illustrated, by, cleopatra, s, immediate, ancestry, of, which, a, reconstruction, is, shown, below, the, family, tree, given, below, also, lists, cleopatra, v, as, a, daughter, of, ptolemy, x, alexander, i, and, berenice, iii, this, would, make, her, a, cousin, of, her, husband, ptolemy, xii, but, she, could, have, been, a, daughter, of, ptolemy, ix, lathyros, which, would, have, made, her, a, sister, wife, of, ptolemy, xii, instead, the, confused, accounts, in, ancient, primary, sources, have, also, led, scholars, to, number, ptolemy, xii, s, wife, as, either, cleopatra, v, or, cleopatra, vi, the, latter, may, have, actually, been, a, daughter, of, ptolemy, xii, fletcher, and, john, whitehorne, assert, that, this, is, a, possible, indication, cleopatra, v, had, died, in, 69, bc, rather, than, reappearing, as, a, co, ruler, with, berenice, iv, in, 58, bc, during, ptolemy, xii, s, exile, in, rome
