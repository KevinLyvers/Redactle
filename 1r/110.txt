interest, in, colour, and, movement, as, seen, in, the, tradition, of, correggio, and, rubens, he, revitalized, the, waning, baroque, style, shifting, it, to, the, less, severe, more, naturalistic, less, formally, classical, rococo, watteau, is, credited, with, inventing, the, genre, of, f, tes, galantes, scenes, of, bucolic, and, idyllic, charm, suffused, with, a, theatrical, air, some, of, his, best, known, subjects, were, drawn, from, the, world, of, italian, comedy, and, ballet, jean, antoine, watteau, was, born, in, october, 1684, in, valenciennes, once, an, important, town, in, the, county, of, hainaut, which, became, sequently, part, of, the, burgundian, and, habsburg, netherlands, until, its, secession, to, france, following, the, franco, dutch, war, he, was, the, second, of, four, sons, born, to, jean, philippe, watteau, 1660, 1720, and, michelle, lardenois, 1653, 1727, and, was, presumed, to, be, of, walloon, descent, the, watteaus, were, a, quite, well, to, do, family, although, jean, philippe, a, roofer, in, second, generation, was, said, to, be, given, to, brawling, showing, an, early, interest, in, painting, jean, antoine, may, have, been, apprenticed, to, jacques, albert, g, rin, a, local, painter, and, his, first, artistic, subjects, were, charlatans, selling, quack, remedies, on, the, streets, of, valenciennes, watteau, left, for, paris, in, 1702, after, a, period, spent, as, a, scene, painter, and, in, poor, health, he, found, employment, in, a, workshop, at, pont, notre, dame, making, copies, of, popular, genre, paintings, in, the, flemish, and, dutch, tradition, it, was, in, that, period, that, he, developed, his, characteristic, sketchlike, technique, his, drawings, attracted, the, attention, of, the, painter, claude, gillot, and, by, 1705, he, was, employed, as, an, assistant, to, gillot, whose, work, influenced, by, those, of, francesco, primaticcio, and, the, school, of, fontainebleau, represented, a, reaction, against, the, turgid, official, art, of, louis, xiv, s, reign, in, gillot, s, studio, watteau, became, acquainted, with, the, characters, of, the, commedia, dell, arte, which, moved, onto, the, th, tre, de, la, foire, following, the, com, die, italienne, s, departure, in, 1697, a, favorite, subject, of, gillot, s, that, would, become, one, of, watteau, s, lifelong, passions, after, a, quarrel, with, gillot, watteau, moved, to, the, workshop, of, claude, audran, iii, an, interior, decorator, under, whose, influence, he, began, to, make, drawings, admired, for, their, consummate, elegance, audran, was, the, curator, of, the, palais, du, luxembourg, and, from, him, watteau, acquired, his, knowledge, of, decorative, art, and, ornamental, design, at, the, palace, watteau, was, able, to, see, the, magnificent, series, of, canvases, painted, by, peter, paul, rubens, for, queen, marie, de, medici, the, flemish, painter, would, become, one, of, his, major, influences, together, with, the, venetian, masters, that, he, would, later, study, in, the, collection, of, his, patron, and, friend, the, banker, pierre, crozat, during, this, period, watteau, painted, the, departing, regiment, the, first, picture, in, his, second, and, more, personal, manner, showing, influence, of, rubens, and, the, first, of, a, long, series, of, camp, pictures, he, showed, the, painting, to, audran, who, made, light, of, it, and, advised, him, not, to, waste, his, time, and, gifts, on, such, subjects, watteau, determined, to, leave, him, advancing, as, excuse, his, desire, to, return, to, valenciennes, he, found, a, purchaser, at, the, modest, price, of, 60, livres, in, a, man, called, sirois, the, father, in, law, of, his, later, friend, and, patron, edme, fran, ois, gersaint, and, was, thus, enabled, to, return, to, the, home, of, his, childhood, in, valenciennes, he, painted, a, number, of, the, small, camp, pieces, notably, the, camp, fire, which, was, again, bought, by, sirois, the, price, this, time, being, raised, to, 200, livres, in, 1709, watteau, tried, to, obtain, a, one, year, stay, in, rome, by, winning, the, prix, de, rome, from, the, academy, but, managed, only, to, get, awarded, with, the, second, prize, in, 1712, he, tried, again, and, was, persuaded, by, charles, de, la, fosse, that, he, had, nothing, to, learn, from, going, to, rome, thanks, to, fosse, he, was, accepted, as, an, associate, member, of, the, academy, in, 1712, and, a, full, member, in, 1717, he, took, those, five, years, to, deliver, the, required, reception, piece, one, of, his, masterpieces, the, pilgrimage, to, cythera, also, called, the, embarkation, for, cythera, watteau, then, went, to, live, with, the, collector, pierre, crozat, who, eventually, on, his, death, in, 1740, left, around, 400, paintings, and, 19, 000, drawings, by, the, masters, thus, watteau, was, able, to, spend, even, more, time, becoming, familiar, with, the, works, of, rubens, and, the, venetian, masters, he, lacked, aristocratic, patrons, his, buyers, were, bourgeois, such, as, bankers, and, dealers, among, his, most, famous, paintings, beside, the, two, versions, of, the, pilgrimage, to, cythera, one, in, the, louvre, the, other, in, the, schloss, charlottenburg, berlin, are, pierrot, long, identified, as, gilles, f, tes, venitiennes, love, in, the, italian, theater, love, in, the, french, theater, voulez, vous, triompher, des, belles, and, mezzetin, the, subject, of, his, hallmark, painting, pierrot, gilles, is, an, actor, in, a, white, satin, costume, who, stands, isolated, from, his, four, companions, staring, ahead, with, an, enigmatic, expression, on, his, face, watteau, s, final, masterpiece, the, shop, sign, of, gersaint, exits, the, pastoral, forest, locale, for, a, mundane, urban, set, of, encounters, painted, at, watteau, s, own, insistence, in, eight, days, working, only, in, the, mornings, in, order, to, warm, up, his, fingers, this, sign, for, the, shop, in, paris, of, the, paintings, dealer, edme, fran, ois, gersaint, is, effectively, the, final, curtain, of, watteau, s, theatre, it, has, been, compared, with, las, meninas, as, a, meditation, on, art, and, illusion, the, scene, is, an, art, gallery, where, the, fa, ade, has, magically, vanished, and, the, gallery, and, street, in, the, canvas, are, fused, into, one, contiguous, drama, watteau, alarmed, his, friends, by, a, carelessness, about, his, future, and, financial, security, as, if, foreseeing, he, would, not, live, for, long, in, fact, he, had, been, sickly, and, physically, fragile, since, childhood, in, 1720, he, travelled, to, london, england, to, consult, dr, richard, mead, one, of, the, most, fashionable, physicians, of, his, time, and, an, admirer, of, watteau, s, work, however, london, s, damp, and, smoky, air, offset, any, benefits, of, dr, mead, s, wholesome, food, and, medicines, watteau, returned, to, france, spending, six, months, with, gersaint, and, then, spent, his, last, few, months, on, the, estate, of, his, patron, abb, haranger, where, he, died, in, 1721, perhaps, from, tuberculous, laryngitis, at, the, age, of, 36, the, abb, said, watteau, was, semi, conscious, and, mute, during, his, final, days, clutching, a, paint, brush, and, painting, imaginary, paintings, in, the, air, his, nephew, louis, joseph, watteau, son, of, antoine, s, brother, no, l, joseph, watteau, 1689, 1756, and, grand, nephew, fran, ois, louis, joseph, watteau, son, of, louis, followed, antoine, into, painting, little, known, during, his, lifetime, beyond, a, small, circle, of, his, devotees, watteau, was, mentioned, but, seldom, in, contemporary, art, criticism, and, then, usually, reprovingly, sir, michael, levey, once, noted, that, watteau, created, unwittingly, the, concept, of, the, individualistic, artist, loyal, to, himself, and, himself, alone, if, his, immediate, followers, lancret, and, pater, would, depict, the, unabashed, frillery, of, aristocratic, romantic, pursuits, watteau, in, a, few, masterpieces, anticipates, an, art, about, art, the, world, of, art, as, seen, through, the, eyes, of, an, artist, in, contrast, to, the, rococo, whimsicality, and, licentiousness, cultivated, by, boucher, and, fragonard, in, the, later, part, of, louis, xv, s, reign, watteau, s, theatrical, panache, is, usually, tinged, with, a, note, of, sympathy, wistfulness, and, sadness, at, the, transience, of, love, and, other, earthly, delights, famously, the, victorian, essayist, walter, pater, wrote, of, watteau, he, was, always, a, seeker, after, something, in, the, world, that, is, there, in, no, satisfying, measure, or, not, at, all, 414, watteau, was, a, prolific, draftsman, his, drawings, typically, executed, in, trois, crayons, technique, were, collected, and, admired, even, by, those, such, as, count, de, caylus, or, gersaint, who, found, fault, with, his, paintings, in, 1726, and, 1728, jean, de, jullienne, published, suites, of, etchings, after, watteau, s, drawings, and, in, 1735, he, published, a, series, of, engravings, after, his, paintings, the, recueil, jullienne, the, quality, of, the, reproductions, using, a, mixture, of, engraving, and, etching, following, the, practice, of, the, rubens, engravers, varied, according, to, the, skill, of, the, people, employed, by, jullienne, but, was, often, very, high, such, a, comprehensive, record, was, hitherto, unparalleled, this, helped, disseminate, his, influence, round, europe, and, into, the, decorative, arts, watteau, s, influence, on, the, arts, not, only, painting, but, the, decorative, arts, costume, film, poetry, music, was, more, extensive, than, that, of, almost, any, other, 18th, century, artist, the, watteau, dress, a, long, sacklike, dress, with, loose, pleats, hanging, from, the, shoulder, at, the, back, similar, to, those, worn, by, many, of, the, women, in, his, paintings, is, named, after, him, according, to, konody, s, critical, assessment, in, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, eleventh, edition, in, part, in, his, treatment, of, the, landscape, background, and, of, the, atmospheric, surroundings, of, the, figures, can, be, found, the, germs, of, impressionism, his, influence, on, later, generations, of, painters, may, have, been, less, apparent, in, france, than, in, england, where, j, m, w, turner, was, among, his, admirers, a, revived, vogue, for, watteau, began, in, england, during, the, british, regency, and, was, later, encapsulated, by, the, goncourt, brothers, in, france, edmond, de, goncourt, having, published, a, catalogue, raisonn, in, 1875, and, the, world, of, art, union, in, russia, in, 1984, watteau, societies, were, created, in, paris, by, jean, ferr, and, london, by, dr, selby, whittingham, a, major, exhibition, in, paris, washington, and, berlin, commemorated, the, 1984, tercentenary, of, his, birth, since, 2000, a, watteau, centre, has, been, established, at, valenciennes, by, professor, chris, rauseo, a, catalogue, raisonn, of, watteau, s, drawings, has, been, compiled, by, pierre, rosenberg, and, louis, antoine, prat, replacing, the, one, by, sir, karl, parker, and, jacques, mathey, similar, projects, on, his, paintings, are, undertaken, by, alan, wintermute, and, martin, eidelberg, respectively, media, related, to, antoine, watteau, at, wikimedia,
