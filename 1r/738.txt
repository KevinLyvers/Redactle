socrates, s, k, r, t, i, z, greek, c, 470, 399, bc, was, a, greek, philosopher, from, athens, who, is, credited, as, the, founder, of, western, philosophy, and, as, among, the, first, moral, philosophers, of, the, ethical, tradition, of, thought, an, enigmatic, figure, socrates, authored, no, texts, and, is, known, mainly, through, the, posthumous, accounts, of, classical, writers, particularly, his, students, plato, and, xenophon, these, accounts, are, written, as, dialogues, in, which, socrates, and, his, interlocutors, examine, a, subject, in, the, style, of, question, and, answer, they, gave, rise, to, the, socratic, dialogue, literary, genre, contradictory, accounts, of, socrates, make, a, reconstruction, of, his, philosophy, nearly, impossible, a, situation, known, as, the, socratic, problem, socrates, was, a, polarizing, figure, in, athenian, society, in, 399, bc, he, was, accused, of, impiety, and, corrupting, the, youth, after, a, trial, that, lasted, a, day, he, was, sentenced, to, death, he, spent, his, last, day, in, prison, refusing, offers, to, help, him, escape, plato, s, dialogues, are, among, the, most, comprehensive, accounts, of, socrates, to, survive, from, antiquity, they, demonstrate, the, socratic, approach, to, areas, of, philosophy, including, epistemology, and, ethics, the, platonic, socrates, lends, his, name, to, the, concept, of, the, socratic, method, and, also, to, socratic, irony, the, socratic, method, of, questioning, or, elenchus, takes, shape, in, dialogue, using, short, questions, and, answers, epitomized, by, those, platonic, texts, in, which, socrates, and, his, interlocutors, examine, various, aspects, of, an, issue, or, an, abstract, meaning, usually, relating, to, one, of, the, virtues, and, find, themselves, at, an, impasse, completely, unable, to, define, what, they, thought, they, understood, socrates, is, known, for, proclaiming, his, total, ignorance, he, used, to, say, that, the, only, thing, he, was, aware, of, was, his, ignorance, seeking, to, imply, that, the, realization, of, our, ignorance, is, the, first, step, in, philosophizing, socrates, exerted, a, strong, influence, on, philosophers, in, later, antiquity, and, has, continued, to, do, so, in, the, modern, era, he, was, studied, by, medieval, and, islamic, scholars, and, played, an, important, role, in, the, thought, of, the, italian, renaissance, particularly, within, the, humanist, movement, interest, in, him, continued, unabated, as, reflected, in, the, works, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, and, friedrich, nietzsche, depictions, of, socrates, in, art, literature, and, popular, culture, have, made, him, a, widely, known, figure, in, the, western, philosophical, tradition, socrates, did, not, document, his, teachings, all, that, is, known, about, him, comes, from, the, accounts, of, others, mainly, the, philosopher, plato, and, the, historian, xenophon, who, were, both, his, pupils, the, athenian, comic, dramatist, aristophanes, socrates, s, contemporary, and, plato, s, pupil, aristotle, who, was, born, after, socrates, s, death, the, often, contradictory, stories, from, these, ancient, accounts, only, serve, to, complicate, scholars, ability, to, reconstruct, socrates, s, true, thoughts, reliably, a, predicament, known, as, the, socratic, problem, the, works, of, plato, xenophon, and, other, authors, who, use, the, character, of, socrates, as, an, investigative, tool, are, written, in, the, form, of, a, dialogue, between, socrates, and, his, interlocutors, and, provide, the, main, source, of, information, on, socrates, s, life, and, thought, socratic, dialogues, logos, sokratikos, was, a, term, coined, by, aristotle, to, describe, this, newly, formed, literary, genre, while, the, exact, dates, of, their, composition, are, unknown, some, were, probably, written, after, socrates, s, death, as, aristotle, first, noted, the, extent, to, which, the, dialogues, portray, socrates, authentically, is, a, matter, of, some, debate, an, honest, man, xenophon, was, no, trained, philosopher, he, could, neither, fully, conceptualize, nor, articulate, socrates, s, arguments, he, admired, socrates, for, his, intelligence, patriotism, and, courage, on, the, battlefield, he, discusses, socrates, in, four, works, the, memorabilia, the, oeconomicus, the, symposium, and, the, apology, of, socrates, he, also, mentions, a, story, featuring, socrates, in, his, anabasis, oeconomicus, recounts, a, discussion, on, practical, agricultural, issues, like, plato, s, apology, xenophon, s, apologia, describes, the, trial, of, socrates, but, the, works, diverge, substantially, and, according, to, w, k, c, guthrie, xenophon, s, account, portrays, a, socrates, of, intolerable, smugness, and, complacency, symposium, is, a, dialogue, of, socrates, with, other, prominent, athenians, during, an, after, dinner, discussion, but, is, quite, different, from, plato, s, symposium, there, is, no, overlap, in, the, guest, list, in, memorabilia, he, defends, socrates, from, the, accusations, of, corrupting, the, youth, and, being, against, the, gods, essentially, it, is, a, collection, of, various, stories, gathered, together, to, construct, a, new, apology, for, socrates, plato, s, representation, of, socrates, is, not, straightforward, plato, was, a, pupil, of, socrates, and, outlived, him, by, five, decades, how, trustworthy, plato, is, in, representing, the, attributes, of, socrates, is, a, matter, of, debate, the, view, that, he, did, not, represent, views, other, than, socrates, s, own, is, not, shared, by, many, contemporary, scholars, a, driver, of, this, doubt, is, the, inconsistency, of, the, character, of, socrates, that, he, presents, one, common, explanation, of, this, inconsistency, is, that, plato, initially, tried, to, accurately, represent, the, historical, socrates, while, later, in, his, writings, he, was, happy, to, insert, his, own, views, into, socrates, s, words, under, this, understanding, there, is, a, distinction, between, the, socratic, socrates, of, plato, s, earlier, works, and, the, platonic, socrates, of, plato, s, later, writings, although, the, boundary, between, the, two, seems, blurred, xenophon, s, and, plato, s, accounts, differ, in, their, presentations, of, socrates, as, a, person, xenophon, s, socrates, is, duller, less, humorous, and, less, ironic, than, plato, s, xenophon, s, socrates, also, lacks, the, philosophical, features, of, plato, s, socrates, ignorance, the, socratic, method, or, elenchus, and, thinks, enkrateia, self, control, is, of, pivotal, importance, which, is, not, the, case, with, plato, s, socrates, generally, logoi, sokratikoi, cannot, help, us, to, reconstruct, the, historical, socrates, even, in, cases, where, their, narratives, overlap, as, authors, may, have, influenced, each, other, s, accounts, writers, of, athenian, comedy, including, aristophanes, also, commented, on, socrates, aristophanes, s, most, important, comedy, with, respect, to, socrates, is, the, clouds, in, which, socrates, is, a, central, character, in, this, drama, aristophanes, presents, a, caricature, of, socrates, that, leans, towards, sophism, ridiculing, socrates, as, an, absurd, atheist, socrates, in, clouds, is, interested, in, natural, philosophy, which, conforms, to, plato, s, depiction, of, him, in, phaedo, what, is, certain, is, that, by, the, age, of, 45, socrates, had, already, captured, the, interest, of, athenians, as, a, philosopher, it, is, not, clear, whether, aristophanes, s, work, is, useful, in, reconstructing, the, historical, socrates, other, ancient, authors, who, wrote, about, socrates, were, aeschines, of, sphettus, antisthenes, aristippus, bryson, cebes, crito, euclid, of, megara, phaedo, and, aristotle, all, of, whom, wrote, after, socrates, s, death, aristotle, was, not, a, contemporary, of, socrates, he, studied, under, plato, at, the, latter, s, academy, for, twenty, years, aristotle, treats, socrates, without, the, bias, of, xenophon, and, plato, who, had, an, emotional, tie, with, socrates, and, he, scrutinizes, socrates, s, doctrines, as, a, philosopher, aristotle, was, familiar, with, the, various, written, and, unwritten, stories, of, socrates, his, role, in, understanding, socrates, is, limited, he, does, not, write, extensively, on, socrates, and, when, he, does, he, is, mainly, preoccupied, with, the, early, dialogues, of, plato, there, are, also, general, doubts, on, his, reliability, on, the, history, of, philosophy, still, his, testimony, is, vital, in, understanding, socrates, in, a, seminal, work, titled, the, worth, of, socrates, as, a, philosopher, 1818, the, philosopher, friedrich, schleiermacher, attacked, xenophon, s, accounts, his, attack, was, widely, accepted, schleiermacher, criticized, xenophon, for, his, na, ve, representation, of, socrates, xenophon, was, a, soldier, argued, schleiermacher, and, was, therefore, not, well, placed, to, articulate, socratic, ideas, furthermore, xenophon, was, biased, in, his, depiction, of, his, former, friend, and, teacher, he, believed, socrates, was, treated, unfairly, by, athens, and, sought, to, prove, his, point, of, view, rather, than, to, provide, an, impartial, account, the, result, said, schleiermacher, was, that, xenophon, portrayed, socrates, as, an, uninspiring, philosopher, by, the, early, 20th, century, xenophon, s, account, was, largely, rejected, the, philosopher, karl, joel, basing, his, arguments, on, aristotle, s, interpretation, of, logos, sokratikos, suggested, that, the, socratic, dialogues, are, mostly, fictional, according, to, joel, the, dialogues, authors, were, just, mimicking, some, socratic, traits, of, dialogue, in, the, mid, 20th, century, philosophers, such, as, olof, gigon, and, eug, ne, dupr, el, based, on, joel, s, arguments, proposed, that, the, study, of, socrates, should, focus, on, the, various, versions, of, his, character, and, beliefs, rather, than, aiming, to, reconstruct, a, historical, socrates, later, ancient, philosophy, scholar, gregory, vlastos, suggested, that, the, early, socratic, dialogues, of, plato, were, more, compatible, with, other, evidence, for, a, historical, socrates, than, his, later, writings, an, argument, that, is, based, on, inconsistencies, in, plato, s, own, evolving, depiction, of, socrates, vlastos, totally, disregarded, xenophon, s, account, except, when, it, agreed, with, plato, s, more, recently, charles, h, kahn, has, reinforced, the, skeptical, stance, on, the, unsolvable, socratic, problem, suggesting, that, only, plato, s, apology, has, any, historical, significance, socrates, was, born, in, 470, or, 469, bc, to, sophroniscus, and, phaenarete, a, stoneworker, and, a, midwife, respectively, in, the, athenian, deme, of, alopece, therefore, he, was, an, athenian, citizen, having, been, born, to, relatively, affluent, athenians, he, lived, close, to, his, father, s, relatives, and, inherited, as, was, customary, part, of, his, father, s, estate, securing, a, life, reasonably, free, of, financial, concerns, his, education, followed, the, laws, and, customs, of, athens, he, learned, the, basic, skills, of, reading, and, writing, and, like, most, wealthy, athenians, received, extra, lessons, in, various, other, fields, such, as, gymnastics, poetry, and, music, he, was, married, twice, which, came, first, is, not, clear, his, marriage, to, xanthippe, took, place, when, socrates, was, in, his, fifties, and, another, marriage, was, with, a, daughter, of, aristides, an, athenian, statesman, he, had, three, sons, with, xanthippe, socrates, fulfilled, his, military, service, during, the, peloponnesian, war, and, distinguished, himself, in, three, campaigns, according, to, plato, another, incident, that, reflects, socrates, s, respect, for, the, law, is, the, arrest, of, leon, the, salaminian, as, plato, describes, in, his, apology, socrates, and, four, others, were, summoned, to, the, tholos, and, told, by, representatives, of, the, thirty, tyrants, which, began, ruling, in, 404, bc, to, arrest, leon, for, execution, again, socrates, was, the, sole, abstainer, choosing, to, risk, the, tyrants, wrath, and, retribution, rather, than, to, participate, in, what, he, considered, to, be, a, crime, socrates, attracted, great, interest, from, the, athenian, public, and, especially, the, athenian, youth, he, was, notoriously, ugly, having, a, flat, turned, up, nose, bulging, eyes, and, a, large, belly, his, friends, joked, about, his, appearance, socrates, was, indifferent, to, material, pleasures, including, his, own, appearance, and, personal, comfort, he, neglected, personal, hygiene, bathed, rarely, walked, barefoot, and, owned, only, one, ragged, coat, he, moderated, his, eating, drinking, and, sex, although, he, did, not, practice, full, abstention, although, socrates, was, attracted, to, youth, as, was, common, and, accepted, in, ancient, greece, he, resisted, his, passion, for, young, men, because, as, plato, describes, he, was, more, interested, in, educating, their, souls, socrates, did, not, seek, sex, from, his, disciples, as, was, often, the, case, between, older, and, younger, men, in, athens, politically, he, did, not, take, sides, in, the, rivalry, between, the, democrats, and, the, oligarchs, in, athens, he, criticized, both, the, character, of, socrates, as, exhibited, in, apology, crito, phaedo, and, symposium, concurs, with, other, sources, to, an, extent, that, gives, confidence, in, plato, s, depiction, of, socrates, in, these, works, as, being, representative, of, the, real, socrates, socrates, died, in, athens, in, 399, bc, after, a, trial, for, impiety, and, the, corruption, of, the, young, he, spent, his, last, day, in, prison, among, friends, and, followers, who, offered, him, a, route, to, escape, which, he, refused, he, died, the, next, morning, in, accordance, with, his, sentence, after, drinking, poison, hemlock, according, to, the, phaedo, his, last, words, were, crito, we, owe, a, rooster, to, asclepius, don, t, forget, to, pay, the, debt, in, 399, bc, socrates, was, formally, accused, of, corrupting, the, minds, of, the, youth, of, athens, and, for, asebeia, impiety, i, e, worshipping, false, gods, and, failing, to, worship, the, gods, of, athens, at, the, trial, socrates, defended, himself, unsuccessfully, he, was, found, guilty, by, a, majority, vote, cast, by, a, jury, of, hundreds, of, male, athenian, citizens, and, according, to, the, custom, proposed, his, own, penalty, that, he, should, be, given, free, food, and, housing, by, the, state, for, the, services, he, rendered, to, the, city, or, alternatively, that, he, be, fined, one, mina, of, silver, according, to, him, all, he, had, the, jurors, declined, his, offer, and, ordered, the, death, penalty, socrates, was, charged, in, a, politically, tense, climate, in, 404, bc, the, athenians, had, been, crushed, by, spartans, at, the, decisive, naval, battle, of, aegospotami, and, subsequently, the, spartans, laid, siege, to, athens, they, replaced, the, democratic, government, with, a, new, pro, oligarchic, government, named, the, thirty, tyrants, because, of, their, tyrannical, measures, some, athenians, organized, to, overthrow, the, tyrants, and, indeed, they, managed, to, do, so, briefly, until, a, spartan, request, for, aid, from, the, thirty, arrived, and, a, compromise, was, sought, when, the, spartans, left, again, however, democrats, seized, the, opportunity, to, kill, the, oligarchs, and, reclaim, the, government, of, athens, the, accusations, against, socrates, were, initiated, by, a, poet, meletus, who, asked, for, the, death, penalty, in, accordance, with, the, charge, of, asebeia, other, accusers, were, anytus, and, lycon, after, a, month, or, two, in, late, spring, or, early, summer, the, trial, started, and, likely, went, on, for, most, of, one, day, there, were, two, main, sources, for, the, religion, based, accusations, first, socrates, had, rejected, the, anthropomorphism, of, traditional, greek, religion, by, denying, that, the, gods, did, bad, things, like, humans, do, second, he, seemed, to, believe, in, a, daimonion, an, inner, voice, with, as, his, accusers, suggested, divine, origin, plato, s, apology, starts, with, socrates, answering, the, various, rumours, against, him, that, have, given, rise, to, the, indictment, first, socrates, defends, himself, against, the, rumour, that, he, is, an, atheist, naturalist, philosopher, as, portrayed, in, aristophanes, s, the, clouds, or, a, sophist, against, the, allegations, of, corrupting, the, youth, socrates, answers, that, he, has, never, corrupted, anyone, intentionally, since, corrupting, someone, would, carry, the, risk, of, being, corrupted, back, in, return, and, that, would, be, illogical, since, corruption, is, undesirable, on, the, second, charge, socrates, asks, for, clarification, meletus, responds, by, repeating, the, accusation, that, socrates, is, an, atheist, socrates, notes, the, contradiction, between, atheism, and, worshipping, false, gods, he, then, claims, that, he, is, god, s, gift, to, the, athenians, since, his, activities, ultimately, benefit, athens, thus, in, condemning, him, to, death, athens, itself, will, be, the, greatest, loser, after, that, he, says, that, even, though, no, human, can, reach, wisdom, seeking, it, is, the, best, thing, someone, can, do, implying, money, and, prestige, are, not, as, precious, as, commonly, thought, socrates, was, given, the, chance, to, offer, alternative, punishments, for, himself, after, being, found, guilty, he, could, have, requested, permission, to, flee, athens, and, live, in, exile, but, he, did, not, do, so, according, to, xenophon, socrates, made, no, proposals, while, according, to, plato, he, suggested, free, meals, should, be, provided, for, him, daily, in, recognition, of, his, worth, to, athens, or, more, in, earnest, that, a, fine, should, be, imposed, on, him, the, jurors, favoured, the, death, penalty, by, making, him, drink, a, cup, of, hemlock, a, poisonous, liquid, in, return, socrates, warned, jurors, and, athenians, that, criticism, of, them, by, his, many, disciples, was, inescapable, unless, they, became, good, men, after, a, delay, caused, by, athenian, religious, ceremonies, socrates, spent, his, last, day, in, prison, his, friends, visited, him, and, offered, him, an, opportunity, to, escape, which, he, declined, the, question, of, what, motivated, athenians, to, convict, socrates, remains, controversial, among, scholars, there, are, two, theories, the, first, is, that, socrates, was, convicted, on, religious, grounds, the, second, that, he, was, accused, and, convicted, for, political, reasons, another, more, recent, interpretation, synthesizes, the, religious, and, political, theories, arguing, that, religion, and, state, were, not, separate, in, ancient, athens, the, argument, for, religious, persecution, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, plato, s, and, xenophon, s, accounts, of, the, trial, mostly, focus, on, the, charges, of, impiety, in, those, accounts, socrates, is, portrayed, as, making, no, effort, to, dispute, the, fact, that, he, did, not, believe, in, the, athenian, gods, against, this, argument, stands, the, fact, that, many, skeptics, and, atheist, philosophers, during, this, time, were, not, prosecuted, according, to, the, argument, for, political, persecution, socrates, was, targeted, because, he, was, perceived, as, a, threat, to, democracy, it, was, true, that, socrates, did, not, stand, for, democracy, during, the, reign, of, the, thirty, tyrants, and, that, most, of, his, pupils, were, against, the, democrats, the, case, for, it, being, a, political, persecution, is, usually, challenged, by, the, existence, of, an, amnesty, that, was, granted, to, athenian, citizens, in, 403, bc, to, prevent, escalation, to, civil, war, after, the, fall, of, the, thirty, however, as, the, text, from, socrates, s, trial, and, other, texts, reveal, the, accusers, could, have, fuelled, their, rhetoric, using, events, prior, to, 403, bc, a, fundamental, characteristic, of, plato, s, socrates, is, the, socratic, method, or, the, method, of, refutation, elenchus, it, is, most, prominent, in, the, early, works, of, plato, such, as, apology, crito, gorgias, republic, i, and, others, the, typical, elenchus, proceeds, as, follows, socrates, initiates, a, discussion, about, a, topic, with, a, known, expert, on, the, subject, usually, in, the, company, of, some, young, men, and, boys, and, by, dialogue, proves, the, expert, s, beliefs, and, arguments, to, be, contradictory, socrates, initiates, the, dialogue, by, asking, his, interlocutor, for, a, definition, of, the, subject, as, he, asks, more, questions, the, interlocutor, s, answers, eventually, contradict, the, first, definition, the, conclusion, is, that, the, expert, did, not, really, know, the, definition, in, the, first, place, the, interlocutor, may, come, up, with, a, different, definition, that, new, definition, in, turn, comes, under, the, scrutiny, of, socratic, questioning, with, each, round, of, question, and, answer, socrates, and, his, interlocutor, hope, to, approach, the, truth, more, often, they, continue, to, reveal, their, ignorance, since, the, interlocutors, definitions, most, commonly, represent, the, mainstream, opinion, on, a, matter, the, discussion, places, doubt, on, the, common, opinion, socrates, also, tests, his, own, opinions, through, the, socratic, method, thus, socrates, does, not, teach, a, fixed, philosophical, doctrine, rather, he, acknowledges, his, own, ignorance, while, searching, for, truth, with, his, pupils, and, interlocutors, scholars, have, questioned, the, validity, and, the, exact, nature, of, the, socratic, method, or, indeed, if, there, even, was, a, socratic, method, in, 1982, the, scholar, of, ancient, philosophy, gregory, vlastos, claimed, that, the, socratic, method, could, not, be, used, to, establish, the, truth, or, falsehood, of, a, proposition, rather, vlastos, argued, it, was, a, way, to, show, that, an, interlocutor, s, beliefs, were, inconsistent, there, have, been, two, main, lines, of, thought, regarding, this, view, depending, on, whether, it, is, accepted, that, socrates, is, seeking, to, prove, a, claim, wrong, according, to, the, first, line, of, thought, known, as, the, constructivist, approach, socrates, indeed, seeks, to, refute, a, claim, by, this, method, and, the, method, helps, in, reaching, affirmative, statements, the, non, constructivist, approach, holds, that, socrates, merely, wants, to, establish, the, inconsistency, between, the, premises, and, conclusion, of, the, initial, argument, socrates, starts, his, discussions, by, prioritizing, the, search, for, definitions, in, most, cases, socrates, initiates, his, discourse, with, an, expert, on, a, subject, by, seeking, a, definition, by, asking, for, example, what, virtue, goodness, justice, or, courage, is, to, establish, a, definition, socrates, first, gathers, clear, examples, of, a, virtue, and, then, seeks, to, establish, what, they, had, in, common, according, to, guthrie, socrates, lived, in, an, era, when, sophists, had, challenged, the, meaning, of, various, virtues, questioning, their, substance, socrates, s, quest, for, a, definition, was, an, attempt, to, clear, the, atmosphere, from, their, radical, skepticism, some, scholars, have, argued, that, socrates, does, not, endorse, the, priority, of, definition, as, a, principle, because, they, have, identified, cases, where, he, does, not, do, so, some, have, argued, that, this, priority, of, definition, comes, from, plato, rather, than, socrates, philosopher, peter, geach, accepting, that, socrates, endorses, the, priority, of, definition, finds, the, technique, fallacious, ccording, to, geach, one, may, know, a, proposition, even, if, one, cannot, define, the, terms, in, which, the, proposition, is, stated, plato, s, socrates, often, claims, that, he, is, aware, of, his, own, lack, of, knowledge, especially, when, discussing, ethical, concepts, such, as, arete, i, e, goodness, courage, since, he, does, not, know, the, nature, of, such, concepts, for, example, during, his, trial, with, his, life, at, stake, socrates, says, i, thought, evenus, a, happy, man, if, he, really, possesses, this, art, techn, and, teaches, for, so, moderate, a, fee, certainly, i, would, pride, and, preen, myself, if, i, knew, epistamai, these, things, but, i, do, not, know, epistamai, them, gentlemen, in, some, of, plato, s, dialogues, socrates, appears, to, credit, himself, with, some, knowledge, and, can, even, seem, strongly, opinionated, for, a, man, who, professes, his, own, ignorance, there, are, varying, explanations, of, the, socratic, inconsistency, other, than, that, socrates, is, simply, being, inconsistent, one, explanation, is, that, socrates, is, being, either, ironic, or, modest, for, pedagogical, purposes, he, aims, to, let, his, interlocutor, to, think, for, himself, rather, than, guide, him, to, a, prefixed, answer, to, his, philosophical, questions, another, explanation, is, that, socrates, holds, different, interpretations, of, the, meaning, of, knowledge, knowledge, for, him, might, mean, systematic, understanding, of, an, ethical, subject, on, which, socrates, firmly, rejects, any, kind, of, mastery, or, might, refer, to, lower, level, cognition, which, socrates, may, accept, that, he, possesses, in, any, case, there, is, consensus, that, socrates, accepts, that, acknowledging, one, s, lack, of, knowledge, is, the, first, step, towards, wisdom, socrates, is, known, for, disavowing, knowledge, a, claim, encapsulated, in, the, saying, i, know, that, i, know, nothing, this, is, often, attributed, to, socrates, on, the, basis, of, a, statement, in, plato, s, apology, though, the, same, view, is, repeatedly, found, elsewhere, in, plato, s, early, writings, on, socrates, in, other, statements, though, he, implies, or, even, claims, that, he, does, have, knowledge, for, example, in, plato, s, apology, socrates, says, but, that, to, do, injustice, and, disobey, my, superior, god, or, man, this, i, know, to, be, evil, and, base, apology, 29b6, 7, in, his, debate, with, callicles, he, says, i, know, well, that, if, you, will, agree, with, me, on, those, things, which, my, soul, believes, those, things, will, be, the, very, truth, whether, socrates, genuinely, thought, he, lacked, knowledge, or, merely, feigned, a, belief, in, his, own, ignorance, remains, a, matter, of, debate, a, common, interpretation, is, that, he, was, indeed, feigning, modesty, according, to, norman, gulley, socrates, did, this, to, entice, his, interlocutors, to, speak, with, him, on, the, other, hand, terence, irwin, claims, that, socrates, s, words, should, be, taken, literally, gregory, vlastos, argues, that, there, is, enough, evidence, to, refute, both, claims, on, his, view, for, socrates, there, are, two, separate, meanings, of, knowledge, knowledge, c, and, knowledge, e, c, stands, for, certain, and, e, stands, for, elenchus, i, e, the, socratic, method, knowledge, c, is, something, unquestionable, whereas, knowledge, e, is, the, knowledge, derived, from, socrates, s, elenchus, thus, socrates, speaks, the, truth, when, he, says, he, knows, c, something, and, he, is, also, truthful, when, saying, he, knows, e, for, example, that, it, is, evil, for, someone, to, disobey, his, superiors, as, he, claims, in, apology, not, all, scholars, have, agreed, with, this, semantic, dualism, james, h, lesher, has, argued, that, socrates, claimed, in, various, dialogues, that, one, word, is, linked, to, one, meaning, i, e, in, hippias, major, meno, and, laches, lesher, suggests, that, although, socrates, claimed, that, he, had, no, knowledge, about, the, nature, of, virtues, he, thought, that, in, some, cases, people, can, know, some, ethical, propositions, there, is, a, widespread, assumption, that, socrates, was, an, ironist, mostly, based, on, the, depiction, of, socrates, by, plato, and, aristotle, socrates, s, irony, is, so, subtle, and, slightly, humorous, that, it, often, leaves, the, reader, wondering, if, socrates, is, making, an, intentional, pun, plato, s, euthyphro, is, filled, with, socratic, irony, the, story, begins, when, socrates, is, meeting, with, euthyphro, a, man, who, has, accused, his, own, father, of, murder, when, socrates, first, hears, the, details, of, the, story, he, comments, it, is, not, i, think, any, random, person, who, could, do, this, correctly, but, surely, one, who, is, already, far, progressed, in, wisdom, when, euthyphro, boasts, about, his, understanding, of, divinity, socrates, responds, that, it, is, most, important, that, i, become, your, student, socrates, is, commonly, seen, as, ironic, when, using, praise, to, flatter, or, when, addressing, his, interlocutors, scholars, are, divided, on, why, socrates, uses, irony, according, to, an, opinion, advanced, since, the, hellenistic, period, socratic, irony, is, a, playful, way, to, get, the, audience, s, attention, another, line, of, thought, holds, that, socrates, conceals, his, philosophical, message, with, irony, making, it, accessible, only, to, those, who, can, separate, the, parts, of, his, statements, which, are, ironic, from, those, which, are, not, gregory, vlastos, has, identified, a, more, complex, pattern, of, irony, in, socrates, on, vlastos, s, view, socrates, s, words, have, a, double, meaning, both, ironic, and, not, one, example, is, when, he, denies, having, knowledge, vlastos, suggests, that, socrates, is, being, ironic, when, he, says, he, has, no, knowledge, where, knowledge, means, a, lower, form, of, cognition, while, according, to, another, sense, of, knowledge, socrates, is, serious, when, he, says, he, has, no, knowledge, of, ethical, matters, this, opinion, is, not, shared, by, many, other, scholars, for, socrates, the, pursuit, of, eudaimonia, motivates, all, human, action, directly, or, indirectly, virtue, and, knowledge, are, linked, in, socrates, s, view, to, eudaimonia, but, how, closely, he, considered, them, to, be, connected, is, still, debated, some, argue, that, socrates, thought, that, virtue, and, eudaimonia, are, identical, according, to, another, view, virtue, serves, as, a, means, to, eudaimonia, the, identical, and, sufficiency, theses, respectively, another, point, of, debate, is, whether, according, to, socrates, people, desire, what, is, in, fact, good, or, rather, simply, what, they, perceive, as, good, moral, intellectualism, refers, to, the, prominent, role, socrates, gave, to, knowledge, he, believed, that, all, virtue, was, based, on, knowledge, hence, socrates, is, characterized, as, a, virtue, intellectualist, he, also, believed, that, humans, were, guided, by, the, cognitive, power, to, comprehend, what, they, desire, while, diminishing, the, role, of, impulses, a, view, termed, motivational, intellectualism, in, plato, s, protagoras, 345c4, e6, socrates, implies, that, no, one, errs, willingly, which, has, become, the, hallmark, of, socratic, virtue, intellectualism, in, socratic, moral, philosophy, priority, is, given, to, the, intellect, as, being, the, way, to, live, a, good, life, socrates, deemphasizes, irrational, beliefs, or, passions, plato, s, dialogues, that, support, socrates, s, intellectual, motivism, as, this, thesis, is, named, are, mainly, the, gorgias, 467c, 8e, where, socrates, discusses, the, actions, of, a, tyrant, that, do, not, benefit, him, and, meno, 77d, 8b, where, socrates, explains, to, meno, his, view, that, no, one, wants, bad, things, unless, they, do, not, know, what, is, good, and, bad, in, the, first, place, scholars, have, been, puzzled, by, socrates, s, view, that, akrasia, acting, because, of, one, s, irrational, passions, contrary, to, one, s, knowledge, or, beliefs, is, impossible, most, believe, that, socrates, left, no, space, for, irrational, desires, although, some, claim, that, socrates, acknowledged, the, existence, of, irrational, motivations, but, denied, they, play, a, primary, role, in, decision, making, socrates, s, religious, nonconformity, challenged, the, views, of, his, times, and, his, critique, reshaped, religious, discourse, for, the, coming, centuries, in, ancient, greece, organized, religion, was, fragmented, celebrated, in, a, number, of, festivals, for, specific, gods, such, as, the, city, dionysia, or, in, domestic, rituals, and, there, were, no, sacred, texts, religion, intermingled, with, the, daily, life, of, citizens, who, performed, their, personal, religious, duties, mainly, with, sacrifices, to, various, gods, whether, socrates, was, a, practicing, man, of, religion, or, a, provocateur, atheist, has, been, a, point, of, debate, since, ancient, times, his, trial, included, impiety, accusations, and, the, controversy, has, not, yet, ceased, socrates, discusses, divinity, and, the, soul, mostly, in, alcibiades, euthyphro, and, apology, in, alcibiades, socrates, links, the, human, soul, to, divinity, concluding, then, this, part, of, her, resembles, god, and, whoever, looks, at, this, and, comes, to, know, all, that, is, divine, will, gain, thereby, the, best, knowledge, of, himself, his, discussions, on, religion, always, fall, under, the, lens, of, his, rationalism, socrates, in, euthyphro, reaches, a, conclusion, which, takes, him, far, from, the, age, s, usual, practice, he, considers, sacrifices, to, the, gods, to, be, useless, especially, when, they, are, driven, by, the, hope, of, receiving, a, reward, in, return, instead, he, calls, for, philosophy, and, the, pursuit, of, knowledge, to, be, the, principal, way, of, worshipping, the, gods, his, rejection, of, traditional, forms, of, piety, connecting, them, to, self, interest, implied, that, athenians, should, seek, religious, experience, by, self, examination, socrates, argued, that, the, gods, were, inherently, wise, and, just, a, perception, far, from, traditional, religion, at, that, time, in, euthyphro, the, euthyphro, dilemma, arises, socrates, questions, his, interlocutor, about, the, relationship, between, piety, and, the, will, of, a, powerful, god, is, something, good, because, it, is, the, will, of, this, god, or, is, it, the, will, of, this, god, because, it, is, good, in, other, words, does, piety, follow, the, good, or, the, god, the, trajectory, of, socratic, thought, contrasts, with, traditional, greek, theology, which, took, lex, talionis, the, eye, for, an, eye, principle, for, granted, socrates, thought, that, goodness, is, independent, from, gods, and, gods, must, themselves, be, pious, socrates, affirms, a, belief, in, gods, in, plato, s, apology, where, he, says, to, the, jurors, that, he, acknowledges, gods, more, than, his, accusers, for, plato, s, socrates, the, existence, of, gods, is, taken, for, granted, in, none, of, his, dialogues, does, he, probe, whether, gods, exist, or, not, in, apology, a, case, for, socrates, being, agnostic, can, be, made, based, on, his, discussion, of, the, great, unknown, after, death, and, in, phaedo, the, dialogue, with, his, students, in, his, last, day, socrates, gives, expression, to, a, clear, belief, in, the, immortality, of, the, soul, he, also, believed, in, oracles, divinations, and, other, messages, from, gods, these, signs, did, not, offer, him, any, positive, belief, on, moral, issues, rather, they, were, predictions, of, unfavorable, future, events, in, xenophon, s, memorabilia, socrates, constructs, an, argument, close, to, the, contemporary, teleological, intelligent, design, argument, he, claims, that, since, there, are, many, features, in, the, universe, that, exhibit, signs, of, forethought, e, g, eyelids, a, divine, creator, must, have, created, the, universe, he, then, deduces, that, the, creator, should, be, omniscient, and, omnipotent, and, also, that, it, created, the, universe, for, the, advance, of, humankind, since, humans, naturally, have, many, abilities, that, other, animals, do, not, at, times, socrates, speaks, of, a, single, deity, while, at, other, times, he, refers, to, plural, gods, this, has, been, interpreted, to, mean, that, he, either, believed, that, a, supreme, deity, commanded, other, gods, or, that, various, gods, were, parts, or, manifestations, of, this, single, deity, the, relationship, of, socrates, s, religious, beliefs, with, his, strict, adherence, to, rationalism, has, been, subject, to, debate, philosophy, professor, mark, mcpherran, suggests, that, socrates, interpreted, every, divine, sign, through, secular, rationality, for, confirmation, professor, of, ancient, philosophy, a, a, long, suggests, that, it, is, anachronistic, to, suppose, that, socrates, believed, the, religious, and, rational, realms, were, separate, in, several, texts, e, g, plato, s, euthyphro, 3b5, apology, 31c, d, xenophon, s, memorabilia, 1, 1, 2, socrates, claims, he, hears, a, daim, nic, sign, an, inner, voice, heard, usually, when, he, was, about, to, make, a, mistake, socrates, gave, a, brief, description, of, this, daimonion, at, his, trial, apology, 31c, d, the, reason, for, this, is, something, you, have, heard, me, frequently, mention, in, different, places, namely, the, fact, that, i, experience, something, divine, and, daimonic, as, meletus, has, inscribed, in, his, indictment, by, way, of, mockery, it, started, in, my, childhood, the, occurrence, of, a, particular, voice, whenever, it, occurs, it, always, deters, me, from, the, course, of, action, i, was, intending, to, engage, in, but, it, never, gives, me, positive, advice, it, is, this, that, has, opposed, my, practicing, politics, and, i, think, its, doing, so, has, been, absolutely, fine, modern, scholarship, has, variously, interpreted, this, socratic, daim, nion, as, a, rational, source, of, knowledge, an, impulse, a, dream, or, even, a, paranormal, experience, felt, by, an, ascetic, socrates, socrates, s, theory, of, virtue, states, that, all, virtues, are, essentially, one, since, they, are, a, form, of, knowledge, for, socrates, the, reason, a, person, is, not, good, is, because, they, lack, knowledge, since, knowledge, is, united, virtues, are, united, as, well, another, famous, dictum, no, one, errs, willingly, also, derives, from, this, theory, in, protagoras, socrates, argues, for, the, unity, of, virtues, using, the, example, of, courage, if, someone, knows, what, the, relevant, danger, is, they, can, undertake, a, risk, aristotle, comments, socrates, the, elder, thought, that, the, end, of, life, was, knowledge, of, virtue, and, he, used, to, seek, for, the, definition, of, justice, courage, and, each, of, the, parts, of, virtue, and, this, was, a, reasonable, approach, since, he, thought, that, all, virtues, were, sciences, and, that, as, soon, as, one, knew, justice, he, would, be, just, some, texts, suggest, that, socrates, had, love, affairs, with, alcibiades, and, other, young, persons, others, suggest, that, socrates, s, friendship, with, young, boys, sought, only, to, improve, them, and, were, not, sexual, in, gorgias, socrates, claims, he, was, a, dual, lover, of, alcibiades, and, philosophy, and, his, flirtatiousness, is, evident, in, protagoras, meno, 76a, c, and, phaedrus, 227c, d, however, the, exact, nature, of, his, relationship, with, alcibiades, is, not, clear, socrates, was, known, for, his, self, restraint, while, alcibiades, admits, in, the, symposium, that, he, had, tried, to, seduce, socrates, but, failed, the, socratic, theory, of, love, is, mostly, deduced, from, lysis, where, socrates, discusses, love, at, a, wrestling, school, in, the, company, of, lysis, and, his, friends, they, start, their, dialogue, by, investigating, parental, love, and, how, it, manifests, with, respect, to, the, freedom, and, boundaries, that, parents, set, for, their, children, socrates, concludes, that, if, lysis, is, utterly, useless, nobody, will, love, him, not, even, his, parents, while, most, scholars, believe, this, text, was, intended, to, be, humorous, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, lysis, shows, socrates, held, an, egoistic, view, of, love, according, to, which, we, only, love, people, who, are, useful, to, us, in, some, way, other, scholars, disagree, with, this, view, arguing, that, socrates, s, doctrine, leaves, room, for, non, egoistic, love, for, a, spouse, still, others, deny, that, socrates, suggests, any, egoistic, motivation, at, all, in, symposium, socrates, argues, that, children, offer, the, false, impression, of, immortality, to, their, parents, and, this, misconception, yields, a, form, of, unity, among, them, scholars, also, note, that, for, socrates, love, is, rational, socrates, who, claims, to, know, only, that, he, does, not, know, makes, an, exception, in, plato, s, symposium, where, he, says, he, will, tell, the, truth, about, love, which, he, learned, from, a, clever, woman, classicist, armand, d, angour, has, made, the, case, that, socrates, was, in, his, youth, close, to, aspasia, and, that, diotima, to, whom, socrates, attributes, his, understanding, of, love, in, symposium, is, based, on, her, however, it, is, also, possible, that, diotima, really, existed, while, socrates, was, involved, in, public, political, and, cultural, debates, it, is, hard, to, define, his, exact, political, philosophy, in, plato, s, gorgias, he, tells, callicles, i, believe, that, i, m, one, of, a, few, athenians, so, as, not, to, say, i, m, the, only, one, but, the, only, one, among, our, contemporaries, to, take, up, the, true, political, craft, and, practice, the, true, politics, this, is, because, the, speeches, i, make, on, each, occasion, do, not, aim, at, gratification, but, at, what, s, best, his, claim, illustrates, his, aversion, for, the, established, democratic, assemblies, and, procedures, such, as, voting, since, socrates, saw, politicians, and, rhetoricians, as, using, tricks, to, mislead, the, public, he, never, ran, for, office, or, suggested, any, legislation, rather, he, aimed, to, help, the, city, flourish, by, improving, its, citizens, as, a, citizen, he, abided, by, the, law, he, obeyed, the, rules, and, carried, out, his, military, duty, by, fighting, wars, abroad, his, dialogues, however, make, little, mention, of, contemporary, political, decisions, such, as, the, sicilian, expedition, socrates, spent, his, time, conversing, with, citizens, among, them, powerful, members, of, athenian, society, scrutinizing, their, beliefs, and, bringing, the, contradictions, of, their, ideas, to, light, socrates, believed, he, was, doing, them, a, favor, since, for, him, politics, was, about, shaping, the, moral, landscape, of, the, city, through, philosophy, rather, than, electoral, procedures, there, is, a, debate, over, where, socrates, stood, in, the, polarized, athenian, political, climate, which, was, divided, between, oligarchs, and, democrats, while, there, is, no, clear, textual, evidence, one, widely, held, theory, holds, that, socrates, leaned, towards, democracy, he, disobeyed, the, one, order, that, the, oligarchic, government, of, the, thirty, tyrants, gave, him, he, respected, the, laws, and, political, system, of, athens, which, were, formulated, by, democrats, and, according, to, this, argument, his, affinity, for, the, ideals, of, democratic, athens, was, a, reason, why, he, did, not, want, to, escape, prison, and, the, death, penalty, on, the, other, hand, there, is, some, evidence, that, socrates, leaned, towards, oligarchy, most, of, his, friends, supported, oligarchy, he, was, contemptuous, of, the, opinion, of, the, many, and, was, critical, of, the, democratic, process, and, protagoras, shows, some, anti, democratic, elements, a, less, mainstream, argument, suggests, that, socrates, favoured, democratic, republicanism, a, theory, that, prioritizes, active, participation, in, public, life, and, concern, for, the, city, yet, another, suggestion, is, that, socrates, endorsed, views, in, line, with, liberalism, a, political, ideology, formed, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, this, argument, is, mostly, based, on, crito, and, apology, where, socrates, talks, about, the, mutually, beneficial, relationship, between, the, city, and, its, citizens, according, to, socrates, citizens, are, morally, autonomous, and, free, to, leave, the, city, if, they, wish, but, by, staying, within, the, city, they, also, accept, the, laws, and, the, city, s, authority, over, them, on, the, other, hand, socrates, has, been, seen, as, the, first, proponent, of, civil, disobedience, socrates, s, strong, objection, to, injustice, along, with, his, refusal, to, serve, the, thirty, tyrants, order, to, arrest, leon, are, suggestive, of, this, line, as, he, says, in, critias, one, ought, never, act, unjustly, even, to, repay, a, wrong, that, has, been, done, to, oneself, n, the, broader, picture, socrates, s, advice, would, be, for, citizens, to, follow, the, orders, of, the, state, unless, after, much, reflection, they, deem, them, to, be, unjust, socrates, s, impact, was, immense, in, philosophy, after, his, death, with, the, exception, of, the, epicureans, and, the, pyrrhonists, almost, all, philosophical, currents, after, socrates, traced, their, roots, to, him, plato, s, academy, aristotle, s, lyceum, the, cynics, and, the, stoics, interest, in, socrates, kept, increasing, until, the, third, century, ad, the, various, schools, differed, in, response, to, fundamental, questions, such, as, the, purpose, of, life, or, the, nature, of, arete, virtue, since, socrates, had, not, handed, them, an, answer, and, therefore, philosophical, schools, subsequently, diverged, greatly, in, their, interpretation, of, his, thought, he, was, considered, to, have, shifted, the, focus, of, philosophy, from, a, study, of, the, natural, world, as, was, the, case, for, pre, socratic, philosophers, to, a, study, of, human, affairs, immediate, followers, of, socrates, were, his, pupils, euclid, of, megara, aristippus, and, antisthenes, who, drew, differing, conclusions, among, themselves, and, followed, independent, trajectories, the, full, doctrines, of, socrates, s, pupils, are, difficult, to, reconstruct, antisthenes, had, a, profound, contempt, of, material, goods, according, to, him, virtue, was, all, that, mattered, diogenes, and, the, cynics, continued, this, line, of, thought, on, the, opposite, end, aristippus, endorsed, the, accumulation, of, wealth, and, lived, a, luxurious, life, after, leaving, athens, and, returning, to, his, home, city, of, cyrene, he, founded, the, cyrenaic, philosophical, school, which, was, based, on, hedonism, and, endorsing, living, an, easy, life, with, physical, pleasures, his, school, passed, to, his, grandson, bearing, the, same, name, there, is, a, dialogue, in, xenophon, s, work, in, which, aristippus, claims, he, wants, to, live, without, wishing, to, rule, or, be, ruled, by, others, in, addition, aristippus, maintained, a, skeptical, stance, on, epistemology, claiming, that, we, can, be, certain, only, of, our, own, feelings, this, view, resonates, with, the, socratic, understanding, of, ignorance, euclid, was, a, contemporary, of, socrates, after, socrates, s, trial, and, death, he, left, athens, for, the, nearby, town, of, megara, where, he, founded, a, school, named, the, megarians, his, theory, was, built, on, the, pre, socratic, monism, of, parmenides, euclid, continued, socrates, s, thought, focusing, on, the, nature, of, virtue, the, stoics, relied, heavily, on, socrates, they, applied, the, socratic, method, as, a, tool, to, avoid, inconsistencies, their, moral, doctrines, focused, on, how, to, live, a, smooth, life, through, wisdom, and, virtue, the, stoics, assigned, virtue, a, crucial, role, in, attaining, happiness, and, also, prioritized, the, relation, between, goodness, and, ethical, excellence, all, of, which, echoed, socratic, thought, at, the, same, time, the, philosophical, current, of, platonism, claimed, socrates, as, its, predecessor, in, ethics, and, in, its, theory, of, knowledge, arcesilaus, who, became, the, head, of, the, academy, about, 80, years, after, its, founding, by, plato, radically, changed, the, academy, s, doctrine, to, what, is, now, known, as, academic, skepticism, centered, on, the, socratic, philosophy, of, ignorance, the, academic, skeptics, competed, with, the, stoics, over, who, was, socrates, s, true, heir, with, regard, to, ethics, while, the, stoics, insisted, on, knowledge, based, ethics, arcesilaus, relied, on, socratic, ignorance, the, stoics, reply, to, arcesilaus, was, that, socratic, ignorance, was, part, of, socratic, irony, they, themselves, disapproved, the, use, of, irony, an, argument, that, ultimately, became, the, dominant, narrative, of, socrates, in, later, antiquity, while, aristotle, considered, socrates, an, important, philosopher, socrates, was, not, a, central, figure, in, aristotelian, thought, one, of, aristotle, s, pupils, aristoxenus, even, authored, a, book, detailing, socrates, s, scandals, the, epicureans, were, antagonistic, to, socrates, they, attacked, him, for, superstition, criticizing, his, belief, in, his, daimonion, and, his, regard, for, the, oracle, at, delphi, they, also, criticized, socrates, for, his, character, and, various, faults, and, focusing, mostly, on, his, irony, which, was, deemed, inappropriate, for, a, philosopher, and, unseemly, for, a, teacher, the, pyrrhonists, were, also, antagonistic, to, socrates, accusing, him, of, being, a, prater, about, ethics, who, engaged, in, mock, humility, and, who, sneered, at, and, mocked, people, socratic, thought, found, its, way, to, the, islamic, middle, east, alongside, that, of, aristotle, and, the, stoics, plato, s, works, on, socrates, as, well, as, other, ancient, greek, literature, were, translated, into, arabic, by, early, muslim, scholars, such, as, al, kindi, jabir, ibn, hayyan, and, the, mu, tazila, for, muslim, scholars, socrates, was, hailed, and, admired, for, combining, his, ethics, with, his, lifestyle, perhaps, because, of, the, resemblance, in, this, regard, with, muhammad, s, personality, socratic, doctrines, were, altered, to, match, islamic, faith, according, to, muslim, scholars, socrates, made, arguments, for, monotheism, and, for, the, temporality, of, this, world, and, rewards, in, the, next, life, his, influence, in, the, arabic, speaking, world, continues, to, the, present, day, in, medieval, times, little, of, socrates, s, thought, survived, in, the, christian, world, as, a, whole, however, works, on, socrates, from, christian, scholars, such, as, lactantius, eusebius, and, augustine, were, maintained, in, the, byzantine, empire, where, socrates, was, studied, under, a, christian, lens, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, many, of, the, texts, were, brought, back, into, the, world, of, roman, christianity, where, they, were, translated, into, latin, overall, ancient, socratic, philosophy, like, the, rest, of, classical, literature, before, the, renaissance, was, addressed, with, skepticism, in, the, christian, world, at, first, during, the, early, italian, renaissance, two, different, narratives, of, socrates, developed, on, the, one, hand, the, humanist, movement, revived, interest, in, classical, authors, leonardo, bruni, translated, many, of, plato, s, socratic, dialogues, while, his, pupil, giannozzo, manetti, authored, a, well, circulated, book, a, life, of, socrates, they, both, presented, a, civic, version, of, socrates, according, to, which, socrates, was, a, humanist, and, a, supporter, of, republicanism, bruni, and, manetti, were, interested, in, defending, secularism, as, a, non, sinful, way, of, life, presenting, a, view, of, socrates, that, was, aligned, with, christian, morality, assisted, their, cause, in, doing, so, they, had, to, censor, parts, of, his, dialogues, especially, those, which, appeared, to, promote, homosexuality, or, any, possibility, of, pederasty, with, alcibiades, or, which, suggested, that, the, socratic, daimon, was, a, god, on, the, other, hand, a, different, picture, of, socrates, was, presented, by, italian, neoplatonists, led, by, the, philosopher, and, priest, marsilio, ficino, ficino, was, impressed, by, socrates, s, un, hierarchical, and, informal, way, teaching, which, he, tried, to, replicate, ficino, portrayed, a, holy, picture, of, socrates, finding, parallels, with, the, life, of, jesus, christ, for, ficino, and, his, followers, socratic, ignorance, signified, his, acknowledgement, that, all, wisdom, is, god, given, through, the, socratic, daimon, in, early, modern, france, socrates, s, image, was, dominated, by, features, of, his, private, life, rather, than, his, philosophical, thought, in, various, novels, and, satirical, plays, some, thinkers, used, socrates, to, highlight, and, comment, upon, controversies, of, their, own, era, like, th, ophile, de, viau, who, portrayed, a, christianized, socrates, accused, of, atheism, while, for, voltaire, the, figure, of, socrates, represented, a, reason, based, theist, michel, de, montaigne, wrote, extensively, on, socrates, linking, him, to, rationalism, as, a, counterweight, to, contemporary, religious, fanatics, in, the, 18th, century, german, idealism, revived, philosophical, interest, in, socrates, mainly, through, hegel, s, work, for, hegel, socrates, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, humankind, by, the, introduction, of, the, principle, of, free, subjectivity, or, self, determination, while, hegel, hails, socrates, for, his, contribution, he, nonetheless, justifies, the, athenian, court, for, socrates, s, insistence, upon, self, determination, would, be, destructive, of, the, sittlichkeit, a, hegelian, term, signifying, the, way, of, life, as, shaped, by, the, institutions, and, laws, of, the, state, also, hegel, sees, the, socratic, use, of, rationalism, as, a, continuation, of, protagoras, focus, on, human, reasoning, as, encapsulated, in, the, motto, homo, mensura, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, but, modified, it, is, our, reasoning, that, can, help, us, reach, objective, conclusions, about, reality, also, hegel, considered, socrates, as, a, predecessor, of, later, ancient, skeptic, philosophers, even, though, he, never, clearly, explained, why, s, ren, kierkegaard, considered, socrates, his, teacher, and, authored, his, master, s, thesis, on, him, the, concept, of, irony, with, continual, reference, to, socrates, there, he, argues, that, socrates, is, not, a, moral, philosopher, but, is, purely, an, ironist, he, also, focused, on, socrates, s, avoidance, of, writing, for, kierkegaard, this, avoidance, was, a, sign, of, humility, deriving, from, socrates, s, acceptance, of, his, ignorance, not, only, did, socrates, not, write, anything, down, according, to, kierkegaard, but, his, contemporaries, misconstrued, and, misunderstood, him, as, a, philosopher, leaving, us, with, an, almost, impossible, task, in, comprehending, socratic, thought, only, plato, s, apology, was, close, to, the, real, socrates, in, kierkegaard, s, view, in, his, writings, he, revisited, socrates, quite, frequently, in, his, later, work, kierkegaard, found, ethical, elements, in, socratic, thought, socrates, was, not, only, a, subject, of, study, for, kierkegaard, he, was, a, model, as, well, kierkegaard, paralleled, his, task, as, a, philosopher, to, socrates, he, writes, the, only, analogy, i, have, before, me, is, socrates, my, task, is, a, socratic, task, to, audit, the, definition, of, what, it, is, to, be, a, christian, with, his, aim, being, to, bring, society, closer, to, the, christian, ideal, since, he, believed, that, christianity, had, become, a, formality, void, of, any, christian, essence, kierkegaard, denied, being, a, christian, as, socrates, denied, possessing, any, knowledge, friedrich, nietzsche, resented, socrates, s, contributions, to, western, culture, in, his, first, book, the, birth, of, tragedy, 1872, nietzsche, held, socrates, responsible, for, what, he, saw, as, the, deterioration, of, ancient, greek, civilization, during, the, 4th, century, bc, and, after, for, nietzsche, socrates, turned, the, scope, of, philosophy, from, pre, socratic, naturalism, to, rationalism, and, intellectualism, he, writes, i, conceive, of, as, precursors, to, a, reformation, of, the, greeks, but, not, of, socrates, with, empedocles, and, democritus, the, greeks, were, well, on, their, way, towards, taking, the, correct, measure, of, human, existence, its, unreason, its, suffering, they, never, reached, this, goal, thanks, to, socrates, the, effect, nietzsche, proposed, was, a, perverse, situation, that, had, continued, down, to, his, day, our, culture, is, a, socratic, culture, he, believed, in, a, later, publication, the, twilight, of, the, idols, 1887, nietzsche, continued, his, offensive, against, socrates, focusing, on, the, arbitrary, linking, of, reason, to, virtue, and, happiness, in, socratic, thinking, he, writes, i, try, to, understand, from, what, partial, and, idiosyncratic, states, the, socratic, problem, is, to, be, derived, his, equation, of, reason, virtue, happiness, it, was, with, this, absurdity, of, a, doctrine, of, identity, that, he, fascinated, ancient, philosophy, never, again, freed, itself, from, the, late, 19th, century, until, the, early, 20th, the, most, common, explanation, of, nietzsche, s, hostility, towards, socrates, was, his, anti, rationalism, he, considered, socrates, the, father, of, european, rationalism, in, the, mid, 20th, century, philosopher, walter, kaufmann, published, an, article, arguing, that, nietzsche, admired, socrates, current, mainstream, opinion, is, that, nietzsche, was, ambivalent, towards, socrates, continental, philosophers, hannah, arendt, leo, strauss, and, karl, popper, after, experiencing, the, horrors, of, world, war, ii, amidst, the, rise, of, totalitarian, regimes, saw, socrates, as, an, icon, of, individual, conscience, arendt, in, eichmann, in, jerusalem, 1963, suggests, that, socrates, s, constant, questioning, and, self, reflection, could, prevent, the, banality, of, evil, strauss, considers, socrates, s, political, thought, as, paralleling, plato, s, he, sees, an, elitist, socrates, in, plato, s, republic, as, exemplifying, why, the, polis, is, not, and, could, not, be, an, ideal, way, of, organizing, life, since, philosophical, truths, cannot, be, digested, by, the, masses, popper, takes, the, opposite, view, he, argues, that, socrates, opposes, plato, s, totalitarian, ideas, for, popper, socratic, individualism, along, with, athenian, democracy, imply, popper, s, concept, of, the, open, society, as, described, in, his, open, society, and, its, enemies, 1945
