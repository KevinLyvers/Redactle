the, palakkad, raja, sought, the, help, of, hyder, ali, hyder, ali, then, led, campaigns, against, the, zamorin, of, calicut, in, the, malabar, coast, of, india, in, 1766, hyder, ali, defeated, the,

territory, the, young, king, of, mysore, krishnaraja, wodeyar, ii, rewarded, hyder, ali, s, performance, by, granting, him, the, title, of, fath, hyder, bahadur, or, nawab, hyder, ali, khan, hyder, ali, is, also, known, to, be, the, first, ruler, of, mysore, to, be, granted, the, title, of, nawab, thus, it, can, be, said, that, he, was, briefly, the, nawab, of, mysore, by, 1759, because, of, the, ongoing, conflicts, with, the, marathas, the, mysorean, treasury, was, virtually, bankrupted, prompting, the, queen, mother, to, force, into, exile, nanjaraj, who, had, assumed, the, position, of, dalwai, upon, his, brother, s, death, in, 1758, hyder, ali, was, a, beneficiary, of, this, action, rising, in, influence, in, the, court, in, 1760, the, queen, mother, conspired, with, khande, rao, who, had, gone, into, the, raja, s, service, to, oust, hyder, ali, he, was, precipitously, forced, out, of, seringapatam, leaving, his, family, including, his, son, tipu, sultan, under, house, arrest, the, sudden, departure, left, hyder, ali, with, few, resources, he, may, have, been, fortuitously, aided, at, this, time, by, the, faraway, third, battle, of, panipat, in, which, the, marathas, suffered, a, major, defeat, on, 14, january, 1761, because, of, this, loss, the, marathas, withdrew, forces, from, mysore, and, hyder, ali, s, brother, in, law, makdum, ali, chased, them, into, bidnur, and, sunda, hyder, ali, soon, consolidated, his, strength, by, placing, mirza, sahib, as, the, commander, of, sira, a, sufi, pir, ibrahim, sahib, maternal, uncle, of, hyder, ali, in, bangalore, and, amin, sahib, his, cousin, in, basnagar, soon, afterward, hyder, ali, marched, alongside, makdum, ali, s, forces, which, numbered, about, 6, 000, along, with, the, 3, 000, men, from, his, garrison, at, bangalore, toward, seringapatam, they, clashed, with, khande, rao, s, forces, before, reaching, the, capital, khande, rao, with, 11, 000, men, won, the, battle, and, hyder, ali, was, forced, to, apply, to, the, exiled, nanjaraj, for, support, nanjaraj, gave, him, command, of, his, army, and, the, title, of, dalwai, with, this, force, hyder, ali, again, moved, out, against, khande, rao, the, two, armies, faced, each, other, again, but, a, deception, by, hyder, ali, convinced, khande, rao, to, flee, instead, of, engaging, in, battle, hyder, ali, sent, letters, appearing, to, be, from, nanjaraj, to, some, of, khande, rao, s, commanders, confirming, their, agreement, to, hand, khande, rao, over, to, hyder, ali, fearing, a, conspiracy, khande, rao, fled, into, seringapatam, after, a, minor, battle, against, the, now, leaderless, army, hyder, ali, took, over, most, of, its, remnants, and, surrounded, seringapatam, the, ensuing, negotiations, left, hyder, ali, in, nearly, complete, military, control, of, mysore, concessions, that, he, extracted, included, the, surrender, of, khande, rao, who, hyder, ali, imprisoned, in, bangalore, hyder, ali, became, king, of, mysore, in, 1761, after, overthrowing, the, prime, minister, and, making, the, king, krishnaraja, wodeyar, ii, a, prisoner, in, his, own, palace, hyder, ali, formally, styled, himself, sultan, hyder, ali, khan, in, his, correspondence, with, the, mughal, emperor, shah, alam, ii, hyder, ali, retained, his, title, during, the, first, anglo, mysore, war, that, raged, in, 1766, and, onwards, he, was, very, cautious, in, his, diplomacy, with, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, who, was, according, to, an, official, mughal, firman, the, sovereign, of, all, muslim, ruled, territories, in, southern, india, the, english, and, the, marathas, continued, to, refer, to, hyder, ali, and, later, his, son, tipu, sultan, as, nabobs, over, the, next, few, years, hyder, expanded, his, territories, to, the, north, two, key, acquisitions, were, sira, taken, from, the, marathas, and, the, kingdom, of, bednore, where, as, a, casus, belli, he, agreed, to, support, a, claimant, to, its, throne, against, usurpers, in, 1763, he, took, its, capital, ikkeri, which, included, a, large, treasury, he, renamed, the, capital, haidernagar, and, began, styling, himself, hyder, ali, khan, bahadur, a, title, that, had, been, bestowed, on, him, by, salabat, jung, as, reward, for, his, taking, of, sira, he, moved, most, of, his, family, to, ikkeri, a, natural, fortress, in, the, hopes, that, it, would, serve, him, for, a, safe, refuge, he, assumed, the, trappings, of, the, ruler, of, bednore, began, issuing, coins, and, established, a, system, of, weights, and, measures, he, made, sure, his, son, tipu, received, a, quality, education, employing, learned, tutors, and, appointing, a, suitable, hand, of, attendants, to, see, to, his, upbringing, he, cultivated, a, suspicion, of, foreigners, specifically, refusing, to, allow, the, east, india, company, to, have, a, resident, at, his, court, his, security, however, was, not, assured, in, bednore, a, bout, of, illness, and, a, widespread, conspiracy, against, him, convinced, him, that, it, would, not, make, an, ideal, capital, for, his, domain, and, he, returned, to, mysore, the, taking, of, bednore, included, several, ports, on, the, malabar, coast, including, mangalore, hyder, used, these, ports, to, establish, a, small, navy, the, documentary, record, on, the, navy, is, fragmentary, portuguese, records, indicate, that, the, fleet, was, launched, sometime, between, 1763, and, 1765, it, was, apparently, officered, by, europeans, and, its, first, admiral, was, an, englishman, by, 1768, its, admiral, was, a, mysorean, cavalry, officer, named, ali, bey, or, lutf, ali, beg, apparently, chosen, by, hyder, because, he, did, not, trust, the, european, captains, hyder, had, amicable, relations, with, the, christian, population, in, mangalore, which, had, long, been, under, portuguese, influence, and, had, a, sizeable, roman, catholic, population, and, with, christians, in, general, he, had, a, very, close, friendship, with, two, goan, catholic, clergymen, bishop, noronha, and, fr, joachim, miranda, and, allowed, a, protestant, missionary, to, live, at, his, court, hyder, s, army, also, included, catholic, soldiers, and, he, allowed, christians, to, build, a, church, at, seringapatam, where, french, generals, used, to, offer, prayers, and, priests, used, to, visit, mangalorean, historian, a, l, p, d, souza, mentions, that, hyder, also, had, christians, in, his, administration, pursuant, to, treaties, concluded, with, the, portuguese, he, also, allowed, portuguese, priests, to, settle, disputes, among, christians, however, many, mangaloreans, not, just, christians, disliked, him, for, the, heavy, tax, burden, he, imposed, on, them, the, maratha, confederacy, had, just, been, routed, at, the, third, battle, of, panipat, by, ahmad, shah, durrani, and, the, mughals, had, been, restored, in, the, year, 1761, the, maratha, empire, was, very, vulnerable, and, feeble, to, any, attack, and, the, peshwa, s, power, had, been, almost, eliminated, in, all, of, northern, india, at, this, point, in, his, life, hyder, ali, decided, to, go, to, war, with, the, marathas, and, put, an, end, to, the, threat, they, posed, to, his, power, he, therefore, attacked, the, maratha, aligned, rani, of, bednore, she, had, appealed, to, the, nawab, of, savanur, for, assistance, when, hyder, invaded, hyder, consequently, threatened, the, nawab, attempting, to, extort, tribute, from, him, failing, in, this, he, overran, that, territory, reaching, as, far, as, dharwad, north, of, the, tungabhadra, river, since, savanur, was, a, tributary, of, the, marathas, the, peshwa, madhavrao, i, countered, with, a, strong, force, and, defeated, hyder, near, rattihalli, and, in, decisive, battle, of, jadi, hanwati, following, the, victory, the, marathas, restored, their, power, under, the, reign, of, madhavrao, peshwa, the, maratha, victory, forced, hyder, to, retreat, he, had, to, abandon, bednore, although, he, was, able, to, remove, its, treasures, to, seringapatam, hyder, paid, 35, lakhs, rupees, in, tribute, to, end, the, war, and, returned, most, of, his, gains, although, he, did, retain, sira, in, 1766, hyder, ali, returned, to, the, malabar, this, time, at, the, invitation, of, the, raja, of, cannanore, who, sought, independence, from, the, zamorin, the, ruler, of, calicut, who, held, sway, over, cannanore, hyder, also, claimed, a, debt, of, tribute, from, the, zamorin, who, had, supported, hyder, s, opponents, in, earlier, campaigns, after, a, difficult, campaign, hyder, reached, calicut, where, the, zamorin, after, promising, to, make, payment, failed, to, deliver, hyder, placed, the, zamorin, under, house, arrest, and, had, his, finance, minister, tortured, fearing, similar, treatment, the, zamorin, set, fire, to, his, palace, and, perished, in, the, flames, ending, eradi, dynastic, rule, of, calicut, after, establishing, control, of, calicut, hyder, departed, but, was, forced, to, return, several, months, later, when, the, nairs, rebelled, against, the, rule, of, his, lieutenant, reza, sahib, hyder, s, response, was, harsh, after, putting, down, the, rebellion, many, rebels, were, executed, and, thousands, of, others, were, forcibly, relocated, to, the, mysorean, highlands, mysore, s, titular, ruler, krishnaraja, died, in, april, 1766, while, hyder, was, in, malabar, hyder, had, left, orders, that, krishnaraja, s, son, nanjaraja, wodeyar, be, invested, should, that, happen, and, he, only, later, came, to, formally, pay, his, respects, to, the, new, rajah, he, took, advantage, of, this, opportunity, to, engage, in, a, sort, of, house, cleaning, the, raja, s, palace, was, plundered, and, its, staff, reduced, to, the, point, where, virtually, everyone, employed, there, was, also, a, spy, for, hyder, ali, after, the, battle, of, buxar, the, british, led, by, hector, monro, decided, to, support, the, maratha, confederacy, against, the, shah, alam, ii, the, nawabs, and, mysore, as, the, power, struggle, between, mysore, and, the, peshwa, continued, it, soon, began, to, involve, the, british, and, other, european, trading, companies, being, himself, a, former, ally, of, the, french, hyder, ali, expected, the, support, of, the, british, against, the, marathas, but, such, support, never, materialized, in, 1766, mysore, began, to, become, drawn, into, territorial, and, diplomatic, disputes, between, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, and, the, east, india, company, which, had, by, then, become, the, dominant, european, power, on, the, eastern, indian, coast, the, nizam, seeking, to, deflect, the, company, from, their, attempts, to, gain, control, of, the, northern, circars, made, overtures, to, hyder, ali, to, launch, an, invasion, of, the, carnatic, company, representatives, also, appealed, to, hyder, ali, but, he, rebuffed, to, them, the, nizam, then, ostensibly, struck, a, deal, with, the, company, administration, in, the, madras, presidency, for, their, support, but, apparently, did, so, with, the, expectation, that, when, hyder, ali, was, prepared, for, war, the, deal, with, the, british, would, be, broken, this, diplomatic, manoeuvring, resulted, in, the, start, of, the, first, anglo, mysore, war, in, august, 1767, when, a, company, outpost, at, changama, was, attacked, by, a, combined, mysore, hyderabad, army, under, hyder, ali, s, command, despite, significantly, outnumbering, the, british, force, british, estimates, place, the, allied, army, size, at, 70, 000, to, the, british, 7, 000, the, allies, were, repulsed, with, heavy, losses, hyder, ali, moved, on, to, capture, kaveripattinam, after, two, days, of, siege, while, the, british, commander, at, changama, colonel, joseph, smith, eventually, retreated, to, tiruvannamalai, for, supplies, and, reinforcements, there, hyder, ali, was, decisively, repulsed, on, 26, september, 1767, with, the, onset, of, the, monsoon, season, hyder, ali, opted, to, continue, campaigning, rather, than, adopting, the, usual, practice, of, suspending, operations, because, of, the, difficult, conditions, the, weather, created, for, armies, after, over, running, a, few, lesser, outposts, he, besieged, ambur, in, november, 1767, forcing, the, british, to, resume, campaigning, the, british, garrison, commander, refused, large, bribes, offered, by, hyder, ali, in, exchange, for, surrender, and, the, arrival, of, a, relief, column, in, early, december, forced, hyder, ali, to, lift, the, siege, he, retreated, northward, covering, the, movements, of, the, nizam, s, forces, but, was, disheartened, when, an, entire, corps, of, european, cavalry, deserted, to, the, british, the, failures, of, this, campaign, combined, with, successful, british, advances, in, the, northern, circars, and, secret, negotiations, between, the, british, and, the, nizam, asaf, jah, ii, led, to, a, split, between, hyder, ali, and, the, nizam, the, latter, withdrew, back, to, hyderabad, and, eventually, negotiated, a, new, treaty, with, the, british, company, in, 1768, hyder, ali, apparently, seeking, an, end, to, the, conflict, made, peace, overtures, to, the, british, but, was, rebuffed, in, early, 1768, the, bombay, presidency, in, bombay, organised, an, expedition, to, mysore, s, malabar, coast, territories, hyder, ali, s, fleet, which, the, british, reported, as, numbering, about, ten, ships, deserted, en, masse, apparently, because, the, captains, were, unhappy, with, the, oustering, of, their, british, admirals, and, some, even, demanded, the, return, of, ali, raja, kunhi, amsa, ii, but, hyder, ali, chose, a, cavalry, commander, lutf, ali, beg, as, fleet, commander, owing, to, a, british, bluff, lutf, ali, beg, also, withdrew, much, of, the, mangalore, garrison, to, move, on, what, he, perceived, to, be, the, british, target, onore, the, british, consequently, captured, mangalore, with, minimal, opposition, in, february, this, activity, combined, with, the, loss, of, the, nizam, as, an, ally, prompted, hyder, ali, to, withdraw, from, the, carnatic, and, move, with, speed, to, malabar, dispatching, his, son, tipu, with, an, advance, force, hyder, ali, followed, and, eventually, re, took, mangalore, and, the, other, ports, held, by, the, over, extended, british, forces, he, also, levied, additional, taxes, as, punishment, against, local, malabari, nair, chieftains, which, were, then, stripped, of, rights, and, authority, after, his, reconquest, hyder, ali, learned, that, the, mangalorean, catholics, had, helped, the, british, in, their, conquest, of, mangalore, behaviour, he, considered, treasonous, he, summoned, a, portuguese, officer, and, several, christian, priests, from, mangalore, to, suggest, an, appropriate, punishment, to, impose, on, the, mangalorean, catholics, for, their, treachery, the, portuguese, officer, suggested, the, death, penalty, for, those, catholics, who, helped, the, british, as, a, typical, punishment, for, the, betrayal, of, one, s, sovereign, in, catholic, nations, but, hyder, ali, exhibited, a, diplomatic, stance, and, instead, imprisoned, those, christians, who, were, condemned, for, treachery, he, afterwards, opened, negotiations, with, the, portuguese, and, reached, an, agreement, with, them, that, removed, suspicion,

british, recovered, many, places, that, hyder, ali, had, taken, and, only, weakly, garrisoned, and, advanced, as, far, south, as, dindigul, they, also, convinced, the, marathas, to, enter, the, conflict, and, a, large, force, of, theirs, under, the, command, of, morari, rao, joined, with, colonel, smith, at, ooscota, in, early, august, 1768, this, army, then, began, preparations, to,

mysore, forces, attacked, the, maratha, camp, during, the, battle, of, ooscota, but, was, repulsed, when, faced, with, the, large, maratha, reinforcements, hyder, ali, was, then, foiled, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, the, arrival, of, a, second, british, column, at, the, allied, camp, the, strength, of, these, combined, forces, convinced, him, to, retreat, from, bangalore, toward, gurramkonda, where, he, was, reinforced, by, his, brother, in, law, he, also, attempted, diplomatic, measures, to, prevent, a, siege, of, bangalore, offering, to, pay, ten, lakhs, rupees, and, grant, other, land, concessions, in, exchange, for, peace, the, company, administration, countered, with, a, list, of, demands, that, included, payments, of, tribute, to, the, nizam, and, several, land, concessions, to, the, east, india, company, hyder, ali, specifically, refused, to, deal, with, muhammed, ali, khan, wallajah, his, nemesis, in, the, carnatic, the, negotiations, failed, to, reach, common, ground, on, 3, october, hyder, ali, while, moving, his, army, from, guuramkonda, back, toward, bangalore, surprised, a, small, garrison, of, muhammed, ali, khan, wallajah, s, men, at, a, rock, fort, call, mulwagal, near, ooscota, british, reinforcements, were, sent, and, colonel, wood, was, able, to, recover, the, lower, fort, but, not, the, upper, the, next, day, he, went, out, with, a, few, companies, of, men, to, investigate, movements, that, might, have, been, cover, for, enemy, reinforcements, this, small, force, numbering, four, companies, was, surrounded, by, hyder, ali, s, entire, army, in, the, battle, of, mulwagal, a, stratagem, by, another, officer, colonel, brooks, prevented, the, loss, of, this, detachment, colonel, brooks, and, another, two, companies, dragged, two, cannons, to, the, top, of, a, nearby, rise, and, brooks, called, out, smith, smith, while, firing, the, cannons, both, sides, interpreted, this, to, mean, that, colonel, smith, was, arriving, in, force, and, hyder, s, troops, began, to, retreat, this, enabled, colonel, wood, to, join, with, brooks, and, other, reinforcements, from, mulwagal, before, hyder, ali, realised, his, tactical, error, hyder, ali, renewed, his, attack, but, was, eventually, repulsed, with, heavy, losses, he, was, estimated, to, lose, 1, 000, men, while, the, british, lost, about, 200, the, severity, of, the, conflict, convinced, colonel, smith, that, he, would, be, unable, to, effectively, besiege, bangalore, without, first, inflicting, a, major, defeat, on, hyder, ali, in, open, battle, company, officials, blamed, smith, for, the, failure, to, decisively, defeat, hyder, ali, and, recalled, him, to, madras, hyder, ali, took, the, opportunity, to, besiege, hosur, and, colonel, wood, marched, in, relief, of, the, town, as, wood, approached, hyder, ali, raised, the, siege, sneaked, around, wood, s, column, and, attacked, his, baggage, train, in, a, battle, near, bagalur, hyder, ali, successfully, captured, supplies, and, arms, and, drove, wood, in, disgrace, toward, venkatagiri, wood, was, consequently, recalled, and, replaced, by, colonel, lang, hyder, ali, then, raised, additional, forces, in, mysore, and, went, on, the, offensive, in, november, 1768, he, split, his, army, into, two, and, crossed, the, ghats, into, the, carnatic, regaining, control, of, many, minor, posts, held, by, the, british, en, route, to, erode, hyder, ali, overwhelmed, one, contingent, of, british, who, were, sent, as, prisoners, to, seringapatam, when, it, was, established, that, one, of, its, officers, was, serving, in, violation, of, a, parole, agreement, after, rapidly, establishing, control, over, much, of, the, southern, carnatic, his, march, approached, madras, this, prompted, the, british, to, send, an, envoy, to, discuss, peace, because, of, hyder, ali, s, insistence, that, the, nawab, of, the, carnatic, be, excluded, from, the, negotiations, they, went, nowhere, hyder, ali, then, surprised, company, authorities, by, taking, a, picked, force, of, 6, 000, cavalry, and, a, small, number, of, infantry, and, made, in, three, days, a, forced, march, of, 130, miles, 210, km, to, the, gates, of, madras, this, show, of, force, compelled, the, company, to, negotiate, further, hyder, ali, who, was, seeking, diplomatic, leverage, against, the, marathas, wanted, an, alliance, of, mutual, defence, and, offence, the, company, refused, to, accede, to, an, offensive, military, treaty, the, treaty, signed, at, madras, on, 29, march, 1769, restored, the, status, quo, ante, bellum, except, for, mysore, s, acquisition, of, karur, and, also, included, language, that, each, side, would, help, the, other, defend, its, territory, in, summarising, hyder, ali, s, conduct, of, the, war, biographer, lewin, bowring, notes, that, he, evinced, high, qualities, as, a, tactician, and, the, sagacity, of, a, born, diplomatist, when, hyder, took, over, the, malabar, territories, he, took, advantage, of, the, coastal, access, to, develop, relations, with, trading, partners, overseas, to, this, end, he, established, port, tariffs, that, were, biased, against, european, traders, and, preferential, for, mysorean, and, arab, traders, beginning, in, 1770, he, sent, ambassadors, to, abu, hilal, ahmad, bin, said, in, muscat, and, karim, khan, in, shiraz, then, the, capital, of, persia, seeking, military, and, economic, alliances, in, a, 1774, embassy, to, karim, khan, the, ruler, of, persia, he, sought, to, establish, a, trading, post, on, the, persian, gulf, karim, responded, by, offering, bandar, abbas, but, nothing, further, seems, to, have, passed, between, them, on, the, subject, karim, khan, later, did, send, 1, 000, troops, to, mysore, in, 1776, in, response, to, another, embassy, in, 1775, nursullah, khan, hyder, s, ambassador, had, more, success, in, muscat, where, a, trading, house, was, established, in, 1776, during, the, final, years, of, his, reign, hyder, ali, also, planned, to, send, an, embassy, to, the, ottoman, sultan, mustafa, iii, but, it, was, his, son, tipu, sultan, who, succeeded, in, making, direct, contact, with, istanbul, hyder, believing, he, would, be, supported, by, the, british, in, conflict, with, the, marathas, began, demanding, tribute, payments, from, smaller, states, on, the, frontiers, between, maratha, and, mysore, territories, and, refused, to, pay, tributes, demanded, by, the, marathas, the, marathas, responded, in, november, 1770, with, an, invasion, by, an, army, of, 35, 000, men, pursuant, to, their, treaty, hyder, requested, british, assistance, the, company, refused, and, hyder, retreated, slashing, and, burning, as, he, went, to, deny, the, bounty, of, the, land, to, the, marathas, the, marathas, captured, much, of, north, eastern, mysore, and, consolidated, their, gains, during, the, monsoon, season, hyder, offered, to, pay, some, of, the, tribute, demanded, but, his, offer, was, rejected, as, insufficient, and, the, marathas, renewed, the, offensive, after, the, monsoons, they, advanced, to, the, vicinity, of, seringapatam, and, then, feinted, a, withdrawal, to, the, north, when, hyder, followed, they, turned, in, force, and, claimed, to, inflict, serious, casualties, on, hyder, s, army, and, captured, most, of, its, baggage, they, then, fruitlessly, besieged, seringapatam, for, five, weeks, before, abandoning, the, effort, and, instead, took, bangalore, hyder, again, appealed, to, the, british, for, help, but, their, pre, conditions, and, proposed, terms, were, unacceptable, to, him, and, an, attempt, by, hyder, to, get, them, to, go, on, the, offensive, scuttled, the, negotiations, in, 1772, hyder, finally, sued, for, peace, he, agreed, to, pay, 3, 6, million, rupees, in, tribute, arrears, and, 1, 4, million, rupees, in, annual, tribute, and, ceded, territory, all, the, way, to, bangalore, upon, his, return, to, seringapatam, after, the, peace, was, concluded, hyder, learned, that, nanjaraja, the, titular, ruler, of, mysore, had, been, engaged, in, secret, communications, with, the, marathas, hyder, ordered, nanjaraja, strangled, and, placed, his, brother, chamaraja, on, the, throne, the, peace, with, the, marathas, was, short, lived, the, peshwa, madhavrao, i, died, late, in, 1772, beginning, a, struggle, for, his, succession, in, 1773, hyder, used, this, opportunity, to, send, tipu, with, an, army, to, recover, territories, lost, to, the, marathas, to, the, north, while, he, descended, into, coorg, which, provided, a, more, secure, route, to, the, malabar, territories, he, wanted, to, recover, from, the, marathas, a, claimant, to, the, coorg, throne, had, asked, for, hyder, s, assistance, in, 1770, when, he, was, pre, occupied, with, the, marathas, he, quickly, captured, coorg, s, capital, merkara, imprisoning, raja, vira, rajendra, he, installed, a, brahmin, as, governor, to, collect, revenues, before, continuing, to, malabar, where, by, the, end, of, 1774, he, had, recovered, all, his, lost, territory, the, coorgs, rose, in, rebellion, against, his, governor, upon, which, hyder, returned, to, coorg, crushed, the, rebellion, and, hanged, most, of, the, ring, leaders, this, did, not, stop, the, restive, coorgs, from, becoming, a, continuing, problem, for, hyder, and, for, tipu, after, his, death, in, 1776, the, young, raja, chamaraja, wodeyar, viii, died, to, choose, a, successor, hyder, had, all, of, the, children, of, the, royal, family, brought, together, and, watched, them, play, a, child, also, named, chamaraja, wodeyar, ix, chose, to, play, with, a, jewelled, dagger, and, was, supposedly, selected, on, that, basis, as, the, new, raja, of, mysore, by, march, 1775, the, leadership, situation, at, poona, the, maratha, capital, had, stabilised, and, the, marathas, joined, an, alliance, with, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, to, oppose, hyder, the, maratha, army, was, routed, by, one, of, hyder, s, generals, in, 1776, and, hyder, either, bribed, or, sufficiently, threatened, the, nizam, s, military, leaders, so, that, they, withdrew, from, the, campaign, this, only, temporarily, halted, the, conflict, which, was, fought, with, renewed, vigor, until, 1779, hyder, successfully, extended, his, domain, to, the, krishna, river, after, a, lengthy, siege, of, dharwad, in, a, controversial, action, hyder, in, 1779, dealt, harshly, with, madakari, nayaka, the, ruler, of, chitradurga, madakari, had, supported, hyder, in, earlier, conflicts, but, in, 1777, had, changed, allegiance, to, the, marathas, after, seizing, chitradurga, hyder, sent, madakari, nayaka, to, seringapatam, as, a, prisoner, where, he, died, hyder, further, sent, 20, 000, of, madakari, s, followers, to, seringapatam, where, the, boys, among, them, were, allegedly, forcibly, converted, to, islam, and, formed, into, so, called, chela, battalions, in, the, mysorean, army, during, the, lengthy, conflict, with, the, marathas, hyder, had, several, times, requested, the, assistance, of, the, east, india, company, and, it, had, each, time, been, refused, in, part, due, to, the, influence, at, madras, of, hyder, s, enemy, the, nawab, of, arcot, the, british, had, also, angered, the, marathas, by, repudiating, treaties, with, whom, they, were, at, war, for, much, of, the, 1770s, and, they, had, also, upset, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, asaf, jah, ii, over, their, occupation, of, guntur, in, 1771, maratha, envoys, had, approached, hyder, with, a, proposal, to, ally, against, the, company, with, the, goal, of, wresting, control, of, eastern, india, from, their, rule, since, hyder, was, at, the, time, still, attempting, alliance, with, the, british, he, informed, them, of, this, offer, noting, that, he, thought, the, marathas, would, gain, too, much, power, and, even, threaten, his, own, position, under, those, circumstances, the, marathas, still, at, war, with, the, british, renewed, an, offer, of, alliance, in, 1779, in, this, case, the, alliance, was, to, include, the, nizam, his, decision, to, join, this, alliance, was, prompted, by, two, british, actions, the, first, was, the, british, capture, by, capitulation, of, the, west, coast, port, of, mah, part, of, a, concerted, effort, by, the, british, to, capture, all, french, outposts, after, the, 1778, french, entry, into, the, american, revolutionary, war, hyder, received, much, of, his, french, supplied, equipment, through, this, french, controlled, port, and, had, provided, troops, for, its, defence, furthermore, the, action, had, provoked, the, nairs, on, the, malabar, coast, to, rise, in, rebellion, again, although, hyder, had, quickly, put, this, down, the, second, offence, was, the, movement, of, british, troops, through, territory, under, his, control, and, also, other, territory, controlled, by, the, nizam, from, madras, to, guntur, there, was, a, skirmish, in, the, hills, and, the, british, detachment, ended, up, retreating, to, madras, hyder, ali, began, rebuilding, his, navy, in, 1778, employing, joze, azelars, a, dutchman, he, had, built, eight, ketches, with, masts, and, 40, cannons, and, eight, smaller, dhows, when, the, war, broke, out, in, 1779, azelars, noted, that, the, brahmans, and, their, allies, made, every, possible, effort, to, halt, progress, of, the, newly, rebuilt, navy, based, at, bhatkal, the, alliance, planned, to, make, virtually, simultaneous, attacks, on, british, holdings, all, throughout, india, while, the, marathas, agreed, to, honour, hyder, s, claims, to, territories, he, currently, held, north, of, the, tungabhadra, river, and, reduced, the, amount, of, tribute, he, was, required, to, pay, under, earlier, agreements, hyder, expected, to, receive, assistance, from, the, french, especially, in, the, carnatic, the, territory, he, sought, to, conquer, however, diplomatic, actions, by, governor, warren, hastings, and, the, company, successfully, convinced, both, the, nizam, and, the, marathas, not, to, take, up, arms, and, hyder, ended, up, fighting, the, war, on, his, own, he, successfully, gained, alliances, with, ali, raja, bibi, junumabe, ii, of, cannanore, arakkal, kingdom, and, the, muslim, mappila, community, and, later, even, met, with, muslim, malays, from, malacca, who, were, in, dutch, service, the, army, hyder, assembled, was, one, of, the, largest, seen, in, southern, india, estimated, to, number, 83, 000, carefully, co, ordinating, the, actions, of, his, subordinate, commanders, he, swept, down, the, eastern, ghats, onto, the, coastal, plain, in, july, 1780, laying, waste, the, countryside, due, to, hyder, s, secrecy, and, poor, british, intelligence, officials, in, madras, were, unaware, of, his, movements, until, the, fires, of, burning, villages, just, 9, miles, 14, km, away, were, seen, in, madras, hyder, himself, organised, the, siege, of, arcot, while, detaching, his, son, karim, khan, sahib, to, take, porto, novo, the, movement, in, august, of, sir, hector, munro, with, a, force, of, over, 5, 000, from, madras, to, kanchipuram, conjeevaram, prompted, hyder, to, lift, the, siege, of, arcot, and, move, to, confront, him, word, then, arrived, that, munro, was, awaiting, the, arrival, of, reinforcements, from, guntur, under, colonel, william, baillie, so, he, sent, a, detachment, under, tipu, to, intercept, them, and, eventually, followed, in, strength, himself, when, munro, sent, a, force, from, his, army, to, meet, baillie, tipu, and, hyder, surrounded, baillie, s, force, and, compelled, the, surrender, of, about, 3, 000, men, in, the, battle, of, pollilur, on, 10, september, it, was, the, first, effective, use, of, rocket, artillery, and, made, a, strong, impression, upon, the, british, hyder, then, renewed, the, siege, of, arcot, which, fell, in, november, shortly, after, the, outbreak, of, hostilities, governor, hastings, had, sent, general, sir, eyre, coote, south, from, bengal, to, take, charge, of, british, forces, opposing, hyder, he, arrived, at, madras, in, november, to, take, command, from, munro, coote, marched, into, the, carnatic, and, eventually, occupied, cuddalore, after, being, re, supplied, there, he, besieged, chidambram, where, an, assault, on, the, fort, was, repulsed, hyder, had, in, the, mean, time, descended, into, tanjore, with, severe, consequences, after, extracting, the, allegiance, of, the, maratha, king, thuljaji, hyder, plundered, the, country, destroying, cattle, and, crops, the, economic, output, of, tanjore, is, estimated, to, have, fallen, by, 90, between, 1780, and, 1782, hyder, s, ravages, were, followed, by, alleged, expeditions, of, plunder, launched, by, the, kallars, the, economic, devastation, wrought, by, these, attacks, was, so, severe, that, tanjore, s, economy, did, not, recover, until, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, the, era, is, referred, to, in, local, folklore, as, the, hyderakalam, with, general, coote, at, cuddalore, hyder, then, made, a, forced, march, to, interpose, his, army, between, chidambram, and, cuddalore, cutting, coote, s, supply, line, coote, marched, to, face, him, and, won, a, decisive, victory, in, the, battle, of, porto, novo, on, 1, july, 1781, coote, estimated, that, hyder, lost, 10, 000, men, in, the, battle, hyder, then, dispatched, tipu, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, the, junction, of, coote, s, army, with, reinforcements, from, bengal, this, failed, and, in, late, august, the, two, armies, met, again, at, pollilur, chosen, by, hyder, as, a, place, to, make, a, stand, because, it, was, the, site, of, his, victory, over, baillie, the, previous, year, hyder, was, defeated, this, time, although, the, battle, was, not, decisive, while, coote, re, grouped, and, searched, for, provisions, hyder, took, the, opportunity, to, besiege, vellore, madras, authorities, convinced, the, ageing, coote, to, put, off, his, retirement, and, relieve, the, fortress, there, hyder, and, coote, met, in, battle, at, sholinghur, near, vellore, hyder, s, artillery, was, ineffective, and, the, re, provisioned, vellore, which, had, been, on, the, brink, of, surrender, lord, macartney, who, had, recently, arrived, to, take, the, governorship, of, madras, also, brought, news, that, britain, was, at, war, with, the, dutch, consequent, to, this, the, company, was, instructed, to, seize, dutch, holdings, in, india, and, macartney, had, ordered, a, detachment, from, tanjore, under, colonel, braithwaite, to, capture, the, main, dutch, post, at, negapatam, hyder, made, an, agreement, with, the, dutch, to, provide, troops, for, its, defence, but, was, himself, forced, away, from, negapatam, by, braithwaite, the, british, took, negapatam, after, a, three, week, siege, in, october, and, november, 1781, this, setback, forced, hyder, to, withdraw, from, most, of, tanjore, in, january, 1782, general, coote, his, health, failing, again, set, out, to, re, provision, vellore, hyder, did, not, prevent, the, re, supply, but, shadowed, the, british, back, toward, tripassore, offering, battle, near, sholinghur, coote, successfully, manoeuvred, away, from, hyder, without, battle, in, february, hyder, detached, tipu, with, a, sizeable, force, to, recover, tanjore, intelligence, failures, led, the, main, british, garrison, to, become, surrounded, by, this, superior, force, colonel, brathwaite, and, 2, 000, men, surrendered, hyder, was, also, pre, occupied, by, bad, news, from, the, west, a, mysorean, force, that, had, been, besieging, tellicherry, was, broken, with, its, commander, and, his, siege, guns, captured, and, coorg, and, malabar, were, also, descending, into, open, rebellion, hyder, consequently, sent, forces, west, to, deal, with, these, matters, and, was, preparing, to, follow, himself, when, word, arrived, on, 10, march, that, a, french, force, had, landed, at, porto, novo, hyder, immediately, sent, tipu, from, tanjore, to, meet, with, them, and, followed, himself, from, arcot, at, this, time, he, had, a, celebrated, meeting, with, the, french, admiral, suffren, and, the, allies, agreed, on, a, plan, to, establish, cuddalore, as, a, french, base, cuddalore, was, occupied, without, resistance, on, 8, april, and, hyder, s, army, joined, by, the, french, marched, toward, permacoil, which, fell, in, may, coote, responded, by, marching, toward, arni, where, hyder, had, a, major, supply, depot, hyder, and, the, french, had, been, considering, an, assault, on, wandiwash, but, abandoned, that, idea, and, marched, to, face, coote, they, skirmished, there, on, 2, june, in, august, the, british, landed, a, force, on, the, malabar, coast, to, which, hyder, responded, by, sending, additional, troops, under, tipu, to, the, west, the, onset, of, the, monsoon, season, then, suspended, most, military, activity, on, the, eastern, plain, and, hyder, established, his, camp, near, chittoor, he, was, a, bold, an, original, and, an, enterprising, commander, skilful, in, tactics, and, fertile, in, resources, full, of, energy, and, never, desponding, in, defeat, he, was, singularly, faithful, to, his, engagements, and, straightforward, in, his, policy, towards, the, british, his, name, is, always, mentioned, in, mysore, with, respect, if, not, with, admiration, bowring, hyder, who, had, suffered, from, a, cancerous, growth, on, his, back, died, in, his, camp, on, 6, december, 1782, some, other, accounts, record, it, as, 7, december, 1782, and, some, historical, accounts, in, the, persian, language, record, the, death, in, dates, ranging, from, hijri, 1, moharram, 1197, to, hijri, 4, moharram, 1197, in, the, islamic, calendar, the, differences, in, recorded, dates, may, be, due, to, the, lunar, calendar, and, the, differences, in, moon, sightings, in, the, surrounding, kingdoms, hyder, s, advisers, tried, to, keep, his, death, a, secret, until, tipu, could, be, recalled, from, the, malabar, coast, upon, learning, of, his, father, s, death, tipu, immediately, returned, to, chittoor, to, assume, the, reins, of, power, his, accession, was, not, without, problems, he, had, to, put, down, an, attempt, by, an, uncle, to, place, tipu, s, brother, abdul, karim, on, the, throne, the, british, learned, of, his, death, within, 48, hours, of, its, occurrence, but, the, dilatory, attitude, of, coote, s, replacement, james, stuart, meant, that, they, were, unable, to, capitalise, on, it, militarily, hyder, ali, was, buried, at, the, gumbaz, in, seringapatam, the,
