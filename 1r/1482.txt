on, marlborough, his, life, and, times, a, biography, of, his, ancestor, john, churchill, 1st, duke, of, marlborough, he, had, developed, a, reputation, for, being, a, heavy, drinker, although, jenkins, believes, that, was, often, exaggerated, hoping, that, the, labour, government, could, be, ousted, he, gained, baldwin, s, approval, to, work, towards, establishing, a, conservative, liberal,

hitler, who, was, then, rising, in, prominence, hanfstaengl, tried, to, arrange, a, meeting, between, churchill, and, hitler, but, hitler, was, unenthusiastic, what, on, earth, would, i, talk, to, him, about, soon, after, visiting, blenheim, churchill, was, affected, by, paratyphoid, fever, and, spent, two, weeks, at, a, sanatorium, in, salzburg, he, returned, to, chartwell, on, 25, september,

remained, there, until, late, october, after, hitler, came, to, power, in, january, 1933, churchill, was, quick, to, stand, in, opposition, to, such, a, regime, and, expressed, alarm, that, the, british, government, had, reduced, air, force, spending, and, warned, that, germany, would, soon, overtake, britain, in, air, force, production, armed, with, data, provided, clandestinely, by, senior, civil, servants, desmond, morton, and, ralph, wigram, churchill, was, able, to, speak, with, authority, about, what, was, happening, in, germany, especially, the, development, of, the, luftwaffe, he, spoke, of, his, concerns, in, a, radio, broadcast, in, november, 1934, having, denounced, the, intolerance, and, militarism, of, nazism, in, the, house, of, commons, while, churchill, regarded, mussolini, s, regime, as, a, bulwark, against, the, threat, of, communist, revolution, he, opposed, the, italian, invasion, of, ethiopia, despite, describing, the, country, as, a, primitive, uncivilised, nation, he, admired, the, exiled, king, of, spain, alfonso, xiii, and, feared, communism, was, making, inroads, during, the, spanish, civil, war, he, referred, to, franco, s, army, as, the, anti, red, movement, but, later, became, critical, of, franco, as, too, close, to, mussolini, and, hitler, between, october, 1933, and, september, 1938, the, four, volumes, of, marlborough, his, life, and, times, were, published, and, sold, well, in, december, 1934, the, india, bill, entered, parliament, and, was, passed, in, february, 1935, churchill, and, 83, other, conservative, mps,

divorcee, wallis, simpson, caused, the, abdication, crisis, churchill, supported, edward, and, clashed, with, baldwin, on, the, issue, afterwards, although, churchill, immediately, pledged, loyalty, to, george, vi, he, wrote, that, the, abdication, was, premature, and, probably, quite, unnecessary, in, may, 1937, baldwin, resigned, and, was, succeeded, as, prime, minister, by, neville, chamberlain, at, first, churchill, welcomed, chamberlain, s, appointment, but, in, february, 1938, matters, came, to, a, head, after, foreign, secretary, anthony, eden, resigned, over, chamberlain, s, appeasement, of, mussolini, a, policy, which, chamberlain, was, extending, towards, hitler, in, 1938, churchill, warned, the, government, against, appeasement, and, called, for, collective, action, to, deter, german, aggression, following, the, anschluss, churchill, spoke, in, the, house, of, commons, a, country, like, ours, possessed, of, immense, territory, and, wealth, whose, defence, has, been, neglected, cannot, avoid, war, by, dilating, upon, its, horrors, or, even, by, a, continuous, display, of, pacific, qualities, or, by, ignoring, the, fate, of, the, victims, of, aggression, elsewhere, war, will, be, avoided, in, present, circumstances, only, by, the, accumulation, of, deterrents, against, the, aggressor, he, began, calling, for, a, mutual, defence, pact, among, european, states, threatened, by, german, expansionism, arguing, this, was, the, only, way, to, halt, hitler, in, september, germany, mobilised, to, invade, the, sudetenland, in, czechoslovakia, churchill, visited, chamberlain, and, urged, him, to, tell, germany, that, britain, would, declare, war, if, the, germans, invaded, czechoslovak, territory, chamberlain, was, unwilling, to, do, this, on, 30, september, chamberlain, signed, the, munich, agreement, agreeing, to, allow, german, annexation, of, the, sudetenland, speaking, in, the, house, of, commons, on, 5, october, churchill, called, the,

actions, and, his, speeches, enhanced, churchill, s, reputation, he, was, concerned, about, german, naval, activity, in, the, baltic, and, wanted, to, send, a, naval, force, but, this, was, soon, changed, to, a, plan, codenamed, operation, wilfred, to, mine, norwegian, waters, and, stop, iron, ore, shipments, from, narvik, to, germany, due, to, disagreements, wilfred, was, delayed, until, 8,

opposition, called, for, a, division, which, was, in, effect, a, vote, of, no, confidence, in, chamberlain, s, government, churchill, was, called, upon, to, wind, up, the, debate, which, placed, him, in, the, difficult, position, of, having, to, defend, the, government, without, damaging, his, prestige, although, the, government, won, the, vote, its, majority, was, drastically, reduced, amid, calls, for, a, national, government, early, on, 10, may, german, forces, invaded, belgium, luxembourg, and, the, netherlands, as, a, prelude, to, their, assault, on, france, since, the, division, vote, chamberlain, had, been, trying, to, form, a, coalition, but, labour, declared, on, the, friday, they, would, not, serve, under, his, leadership, although, they, would, accept, another, conservative, the, only, two, candidates, were, churchill, and, lord, halifax, the, foreign, secretary, the, matter, had, already, been, discussed, at, a, meeting, on, the, 9th, between, chamberlain, halifax, churchill, and, david, margesson, the, government, chief, whip, halifax, admitted, he, could, not, govern, effectively, as, a, member, of, the, house, of, lords, so, chamberlain, advised, the, king, to, send, for, churchill, who, became, prime, minister, churchill, later, wrote, of, a, profound, sense, of, relief, as, he, now, had, authority, over, the, whole, scene, he, believed, his, life, so, far, had, been, a, preparation, for, this, hour, and, for, this, trial, in, may, churchill, was, still, unpopular, with, many, conservatives, and, most, of, the, labour, party, chamberlain, remained, conservative, party, leader, until, october, by, that, time, churchill, had, won, over, his, doubters, and, his, succession, was, a, formality, he, began, his, premiership, by, forming, a, war, cabinet, chamberlain, as, lord, president, of, the, council, labour, leader, clement, attlee, as, lord, privy, seal, later, deputy, prime, minister, halifax, as, foreign, secretary, and, labour, s, arthur, greenwood, as, a, minister, without, portfolio, in, practice, these, five, were, augmented, by, the, service, chiefs, and, ministers, who, attended, most, meetings, the, cabinet, changed, in, size, and, membership, as, the, war, progressed, a, key, appointment, being, the, leading, trades, unionist, ernest, bevin, as, minister, of, labour, and, national, service, in, response, to, criticisms, churchill, created, and, assumed, the, position, of, minister, of, defence, making, him, the, most, powerful, wartime, prime, minister, in, history, he, drafted, outside, experts, into, government, to, fulfil, vital, functions, especially, on, the, home, front, these, included, friends, like, lord, beaverbrook, and, frederick, lindemann, who, became, the, government, s, scientific, advisor, at, the, end, of, may, with, the, british, expeditionary, force, in, retreat, to, dunkirk, and, the, fall, of, france, imminent, halifax, proposed, the, government, should, explore, a, peace, settlement, using, the, still, neutral, mussolini, as, an, intermediary, there, were, high, level, meetings, from, 26, to, 28, may, including, with, the, french, premier, paul, reynaud, churchill, s, resolve, was, to, fight, on, even, if, france, capitulated, but, his, position, remained, precarious, until, chamberlain, resolved, to, support, him, churchill, had, the, full, support, of, the, two, labour, members, but, knew, he, could, not, survive, as, prime, minister, if, both, chamberlain, and, halifax, were, against, him, by, gaining, the, support, of, his, outer, cabinet, churchill, outmanoeuvred, halifax, and, won, chamberlain, over, churchill, succeeded, as, an, orator, despite, being, handicapped, from, childhood, with, a, speech, impediment, he, had, a, lateral, lisp, and, was, unable, to, pronounce, the, letter, s, verbalising, it, with, a, slur, he, worked, on, his, pronunciation, by, repeating, phrases, designed, to, cure, his, problem, with, the, sibilant, s, he, was, ultimately, successful, turning, the, impediment, into, an, asset, as, when, he, called, hitler, a, nar, zee, rhymes, with, khazi, emphasis, on, the, z, rather, than, a, nazi, ts, his, first, speech, as, prime, minister, delivered, to, the, commons, on, 13, may, was, the, blood, toil, tears, and, sweat, speech, churchill, made, it, plain, to, the, nation, that, a, long, road, lay, ahead, and, that, victory, was, the, final, goal, i, would, say, to, the, house, that, i, have, nothing, to, offer, but, blood, toil, tears, and, sweat, we, have, before, us, an, ordeal, of, the, most, grievous, kind, you, ask, what, is, our, policy, i, will, say, it, is, to, wage, war, by, sea, land, and, air, with, all, our, might, and, with, all, the, strength, that, god, can, give, us, to, wage, war, against, a, monstrous, tyranny, never, surpassed, in, the, dark, lamentable, catalogue, of, human, crime, that, is, our, policy, you, ask, what, is, our, aim, i, can, answer, in, one, word, it, is, victory, victory, at, all, costs, victory, in, spite, of, all, terror, victory, however, long, and, hard, the, road, may, be, for, without, victory, there, is, no, survival, churchill, s, use, of, rhetoric, hardened, public, opinion, against, a, peaceful, resolution, jenkins, says, churchill, s, speeches, were, an, inspiration, for, the, nation, and, a, catharsis, for, churchill, himself, the, dunkirk, evacuation, of, 338, 226, allied, servicemen, ended, on, 4, june, when, the, french, rearguard, surrendered, the, total, was, far, in, excess, of, expectations, and, gave, rise, to, a, popular, view, dunkirk, had, been, a, miracle, even, a, victory, churchill, himself, referred, to, a, miracle, of, deliverance, in, his, we, shall, fight, on, the, beaches, speech, to, the, commons, that, afternoon, the, speech, ended, on, a, note, of, defiance, with, a, clear, appeal, to, the, united, states, we, shall, go, on, to, the, end, we, shall, fight, in, france, we, shall, fight, on, the, seas, and, oceans, we, shall, fight, with, growing, confidence, and, growing, strength, in, the, air, we, shall, defend, our, island, whatever, the, cost, may, be, we, shall, fight, on, the, beaches, we, shall, fight, on, the, landing, grounds, we, shall, fight, in, the, fields, and, in, the, streets, we, shall, fight, in, the, hills, we, shall, never, surrender, and, even, if, which, i, do, not, for, a, moment, believe, this, island, or, a, large, part, of, it, were, subjugated, and, starving, then, our, empire, beyond, the, seas, armed, and, guarded, by, the, british, fleet, would, carry, on, the, struggle, until, in, god, s, good, time, the, new, world, with, all, its, power, and, might, steps, forth, to, the, rescue, and, the, liberation, of, the, old, germany, initiated, fall, rot, in, france, the, following, day, and, italy, entered, the, war, on, the, 10th, the, wehrmacht, occupied, paris, on, the, 14th, and, completed, their, conquest, of, france, on, 25, june, it, was, now, inevitable, that, hitler, would, attack, and, probably, try, to, invade, great, britain, faced, with, this, churchill, addressed, the, commons, on, 18, june, with, one, of, his, most, famous, speeches, ending, with, this, peroration, what, general, weygand, called, the, battle, of, france, is, over, i, expect, that, the, battle, of, britain, is, about, to, begin, hitler, knows, that, he, will, have, to, break, us, in, this, island, or, lose, the, war, let, us, therefore, brace, ourselves, to, our, duty, and, so, bear, ourselves, that, if, the, british, commonwealth, and, empire, lasts, for, a, thousand, years, men, will, still, say, this, was, their, finest, hour, churchill, ordered, the, commencement, of, the, western, desert, campaign, on, 11, june, a, response, to, the, italian, declaration, of, war, this, went, well, at, first, while, italy, was, the, sole, opposition, and, operation, compass, was, a, success, in, early, 1941, however, mussolini, requested, german, support, hitler, sent, the, afrika, korps, to, tripoli, under, generalleutnant, erwin, rommel, who, arrived, not, long, after, churchill, had, halted, compass, so, he, could, reassign, forces, to, greece, where, the, balkans, campaign, was, entering, a, critical, phase, in, other, initiatives, through, june, and, july, 1940, churchill, ordered, the, formation, of, the, special, operations, executive, soe, and, commandos, the, soe, was, ordered, to, promote, and, execute, subversive, activity, in, nazi, occupied, europe, while, the, commandos, were, charged, with, raids, on, military, targets, there, hugh, dalton, the, minister, of, economic, warfare, took, political, responsibility, for, the, soe, and, recorded, that, churchill, told, him, and, now, go, and, set, europe, ablaze, on, 20, august, 1940, at, the, height, of, the, battle, of, britain, churchill, addressed, the, commons, to, outline, the, situation, in, the, middle, of, it, he, made, a, statement, that, created, a, famous, nickname, for, the, raf, fighter, pilots, involved, in, the, battle, the, gratitude, of, every, home, in, our, island, in, our, empire, and, indeed, throughout, the, world, except, in, the, abodes, of, the, guilty, goes, out, to, the, british, airmen, who, undaunted, by, odds, unwearied, in, their, constant, challenge, and, mortal, danger, are, turning, the, tide, of, the, world, war, by, their, prowess, and, by, their, devotion, never, in, the, field, of, human, conflict, was, so, much, owed, by, so, many, to, so, few, the, luftwaffe, altered, its, strategy, from, 7, september, 1940, and, began, the, blitz, which, was, intensive, through, october, and, november, churchill, s, morale, was, high, and, told, his, private, secretary, john, colville, in, november, he, thought, the, threat, of, invasion, was, past, he, was, confident, great, britain, could, hold, its, own, given, the, increase, in, output, but, was, realistic, about, its, chances, of, winning, the, war, without, american, intervention, in, september, 1940, the, british, and, american, governments, concluded, the, destroyers, for, bases, deal, by, which, 50, american, destroyers, were, transferred, to, the, royal, navy, in, exchange, for, free, us, base, rights, in, bermuda, the, caribbean, and, newfoundland, an, added, advantage, for, britain, was, that, its, military, assets, in, those, bases, could, be, redeployed, elsewhere, churchill, s, good, relations, with, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, helped, secure, vital, food, oil, and, munitions, via, the, north, atlantic, shipping, routes, it, was, for, this, reason, that, churchill, was, relieved, when, roosevelt, was, re, elected, in, 1940, roosevelt, set, about, implementing, a, new, method, of, providing, necessities, to, great, britain, without, the, need, for, monetary, payment, he, persuaded, congress, that, repayment, for, this, costly, service, would, take, the, form, of, defending, the, us, the, policy, was, known, as, lend, lease, and, was, formally, enacted, on, 11, march, 1941, hitler, launched, his, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, on, 22, june, 1941, churchill, had, known, since, april, from, enigma, decrypts, at, bletchley, park, that, the, attack, was, imminent, he, had, tried, to, warn, joseph, stalin, via, the, ambassador, to, moscow, stafford, cripps, but, stalin, did, not, trust, churchill, the, night, before, the, attack, already, intending, to, address, the, nation, churchill, alluded, to, his, hitherto, anti, communist, views, by, saying, to, colville, if, hitler, invaded, hell, i, would, at, least, make, a, favourable, reference, to, the, devil, in, august, 1941, churchill, made, his, first, transatlantic, crossing, of, the, war, on, board, hms, prince, of, wales, and, met, roosevelt, in, placentia, bay, newfoundland, on, 14, august, they, issued, the, joint, statement, known, as, the, atlantic, charter, this, outlined, the, goals, of, both, countries, for, the, future, of, the, world, and, is, seen, as, the, inspiration, for, the, 1942, declaration, by, united, nations, itself, the, basis, of, the, un, founded, in, 1945, in, december, 1941, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, was, followed, by, their, invasion, of, malaya, and, on, the, 8th, churchill, declared, war, on, japan, with, the, hope, of, using, irish, ports, for, counter, submarine, operations, churchill, sent, a, telegram, to, irish, prime, minister, amon, de, valera, in, which, he, obliquely, offers, irish, unity, now, is, your, chance, now, or, never, a, nation, once, again, i, will, meet, you, wherever, you, wish, no, meeting, took, place, and, there, is, no, record, of, a, response, churchill, went, to, washington, to, meet, roosevelt, for, the, arcadia, conference, this, was, important, for, europe, first, the, decision, to, prioritise, victory, in, europe, over, victory, in, the, pacific, taken, by, roosevelt, while, churchill, was, still, in, the, mid, atlantic, the, americans, agreed, with, churchill, that, hitler, was, the, main, enemy, and, defeat, of, germany, was, key, to, allied, success, it, was, also, agreed, that, the, first, joint, anglo, american, strike, would, be, operation, torch, the, invasion, of, french, north, africa, originally, planned, for, the, spring, 1942, it, was, launched, in, november, 1942, when, the, crucial, second, battle, of, el, alamein, was, underway, on, 26, december, churchill, addressed, a, joint, meeting, of, the, us, congress, but, that, night, suffered, a, heart, attack, diagnosed, by, his, physician, sir, charles, wilson, as, a, coronary, deficiency, needing, several, weeks, bed, rest, churchill, insisted, he, did, not, need, bed, rest, and, journeyed, to, ottawa, by, train, where, he, gave, a, speech, to, the, canadian, parliament, that, included, the, some, chicken, some, neck, line, in, which, he, recalled, french, predictions, in, 1940, that, britain, alone, would, have, her, neck, wrung, like, a, chicken, he, arrived, home, mid, january, having, flown, from, bermuda, to, plymouth, in, the, first, transatlantic, air, crossing, by, a, head, of, government, to, find, there, was, a, crisis, of, confidence, in, his, government, and, him, he, decided, to, face, a, vote, of, confidence, in, the, commons, which, he, won, easily, while, he, was, away, the, eighth, army, having, relieved, the, siege, of, tobruk, had, pursued, operation, crusader, against, rommel, s, forces, in, libya, successfully, driving, them, back, to, a, defensive, position, at, el, agheila, in, cyrenaica, on, 21, january, 1942, however, rommel, launched, a, surprise, counter, attack, which, drove, the, allies, back, to, gazala, elsewhere, british, success, in, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, was, compromised, by, the, kriegsmarine, s, introduction, of, its, m4, 4, rotor, enigma, whose, signals, could, not, be, deciphered, by, bletchley, park, for, nearly, a, year, at, a, press, conference, in, washington, churchill, had, to, play, down, his, increasing, doubts, about, the, security, of, singapore, given, japanese, advances, churchill, already, had, grave, concerns, about, the, quality, of, british, troops, after, the, defeats, in, norway, france, greece, and, crete, following, the, fall, of, singapore, to, the, japanese, on, 15, february, 1942, he, felt, his, misgivings, were, confirmed, and, said, this, is, the, worst, disaster, and, largest, capitulation, in, british, military, history, on, 11, february, the, kriegsmarine, pulled, off, its, audacious, channel, dash, a, massive, blow, to, british, naval, prestige, the, combined, effect, of, these, events, was, to, sink, churchill, s, morale, to, its, lowest, point, of, the, war, meanwhile, the, japanese, had, occupied, most, of, burma, by, the, end, of, april, 1942, counter, offensives, were, hampered, by, the, monsoon, season, and, disordered, conditions, in, bengal, and, bihar, as, well, as, a, severe, cyclone, which, devastated, the, region, in, october, 1942, a, combination, of, factors, including, the, curtailment, of, essential, rice, imports, from, burma, poor, administration, wartime, inflation, and, large, scale, natural, disasters, such, as, flooding, and, crop, disease, led, to, the, bengal, famine, of, 1943, in, which, an, estimated, 2, 1, 3, 8, million, people, died, from, december, 1942, food, shortages, had, prompted, senior, officials, to, ask, london, for, grain, imports, although, the, colonial, authorities, failed, to, recognise, the, seriousness, of, the, famine, and, responded, ineptly, churchill, s, government, was, criticised, for, refusing, to, approve, more, imports, a, policy, it, ascribed, to, an, acute, shortage, of, shipping, when, the, british, realised, the, full, extent, of, the, famine, in, september, 1943, churchill, ordered, the, transportation, of, 130, 000, tons, of, grain, and, the, cabinet, agreed, to, send, 200, 000, tons, by, the, end, of, the, year, during, the, last, quarter, of, 1943, 100, 000, tons, of, rice, and, 176, 000, tons, of, wheat, were, imported, compared, to, averages, of, 55, 000, and, 54, 000, tons, respectively, earlier, in, the, year, in, october, churchill, wrote, to, the, viceroy, of, india, lord, wavell, charging, him, with, the, responsibility, of, ending, the, famine, in, february, 1944, as, preparation, for, operation, overlord, placed, greater, demands, on, allied, shipping, churchill, cabled, wavell, saying, i, will, certainly, help, you, all, i, can, but, you, must, not, ask, the, impossible, grain, shipment, requests, continued, to, be, turned, down, by, the, government, throughout, 1944, and, wavell, complained, to, churchill, in, october, that, the, vital, problems, of, india, are, being, treated, by, his, majesty, s, government, with, neglect, even, sometimes, with, hostility, and, contempt, the, impact, of, british, policies, on, the, famine, death, toll, remains, controversial, on, 20, may, 1942, the, soviet, foreign, minister, vyacheslav, molotov, arrived, in, london, to, sign, a, treaty, of, friendship, molotov, wanted, it, done, on, the, basis, of, territorial, concessions, regarding, poland, and, the, baltic, countries, churchill, and, eden, worked, for, a, compromise, and, a, twenty, year, treaty, was, formalised, with, the, question, of, frontiers, placed, on, hold, molotov, also, sought, a, second, front, in, europe, churchill, confirmed, preparations, were, in, progress, and, made, no, promises, on, a, date, churchill, felt, pleased, with, these, negotiations, however, rommel, had, launched, his, counter, offensive, operation, venice, to, begin, the, battle, of, gazala, on, 26, may, the, allies, were, driven, out, of, libya, and, suffered, a, defeat, in, the, fall, of, tobruk, on, 21, june, churchill, was, with, roosevelt, when, the, news, reached, him, and, was, shocked, by, the, surrender, of, 35, 000, troops, which, was, apart, from, singapore, the, heaviest, blow, he, received, in, the, war, the, axis, advance, was, halted, at, the, first, battle, of, el, alamein, in, july, and, the, battle, of, alam, el, halfa, in, september, both, sides, were, exhausted, and, in, need, of, reinforcements, and, supplies, churchill, returned, to, washington, on, 17, june, he, and, roosevelt, agreed, on, the, implementation, of, operation, torch, as, the, necessary, precursor, to, an, invasion, of, europe, roosevelt, had, appointed, general, dwight, d, eisenhower, as, commanding, officer, of, the, european, theater, of, operations, united, states, army, etousa, having, received, the, news, from, north, africa, churchill, obtained, shipment, from, america, to, the, eighth, army, of, 300, sherman, tanks, and, 100, howitzers, he, returned, to, britain, on, 25, june, and, had, to, face, another, motion, of, no, confidence, this, time, in, his, direction, of, the, war, but, again, he, won, easily, in, august, despite, health, concerns, churchill, visited, british, forces, in, north, africa, raising, morale, en, route, to, moscow, for, his, first, meeting, with, stalin, he, was, accompanied, by, roosevelt, s, special, envoy, averell, harriman, he, was, in, moscow, 12, 16, august, and, had, lengthy, meetings, with, stalin, though, they, got, along, well, personally, there, was, little, chance, of, real, progress, given, the, state, of, the, war, stalin, was, desperate, for, the, allies, to, open, the, second, front, in, europe, as, churchill, had, discussed, with, molotov, in, may, and, the, answer, was, the, same, while, he, was, in, cairo, in, august, churchill, appointed, field, marshal, alexander, as, field, marshal, auchinleck, s, successor, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, middle, east, theatre, command, of, the, eighth, army, was, given, to, general, william, gott, but, he, was, shot, down, and, killed, while, flying, to, cairo, and, general, montgomery, succeeded, him, as, 1942, drew, to, a, close, the, tide, of, war, began, to, turn, with, allied, victories, in, el, alamein, and, stalingrad, until, november, the, allies, had, been, on, the, defensive, but, afterwards, the, germans, were, churchill, ordered, church, bells, to, be, rung, throughout, great, britain, for, the, first, time, since, 1940, on, 10, november, knowing, el, alamein, was, a, victory, he, delivered, one, of, his, most, memorable, speeches, at, mansion, house, in, london, this, is, not, the, end, it, is, not, even, the, beginning, of, the, end, but, it, is, perhaps, the, end, of, the, beginning, in, january, 1943, churchill, met, roosevelt, at, the, casablanca, conference, it, was, attended, by, general, charles, de, gaulle, from, the, free, french, forces, stalin, had, hoped, to, attend, but, declined, because, of, stalingrad, although, churchill, expressed, doubts, on, the, matter, the, so, called, casablanca, declaration, committed, the, allies, to, securing, unconditional, surrender, from, morocco, churchill, went, to, cairo, adana, cyprus, cairo, again, and, algiers, he, arrived, home, on, 7, february, having, been, out, of, the, country, for, a, month, he, addressed, the, commons, on,

15, march, churchill, made, two, transatlantic, crossings, during, the, year, meeting, roosevelt, at, the, third, washington, conference, in, may, and, the, first, quebec, conference, in, august, in, november, churchill, and, roosevelt, met, chinese, generalissimo, chiang, kai, shek, at, the, cairo, conference, the, most, important, conference, of, the, year, was, 28, november, to, 1, december, at, tehran, where, churchill, and, roosevelt, met, stalin, in, the, first, of, the, big, three, meetings, preceding, those, at, yalta, and, potsdam, roosevelt, and, stalin, co, operated, in, persuading, churchill, to, commit, to, opening, of, second, front, in, western, europe, and, it, was, agreed, germany, would, be, divided, after, the, war, but, no, decisions, were, made, about, how, on, their, way, back, churchill, and, roosevelt, held, a, second, cairo, conference, with, turkish, president, smet, n, n, but, were, unable, to, gain, commitment, from, turkey, to, join, the, allies,

371, days, in, the, autumn, of, 1942, after, churchill, s, meeting, with, stalin, he, was, approached, by, eisenhower, commanding, the, north, african, theater, of, operations, us, army, natousa, and, his, aides, on, the, subject, of, where, the, western, allies, should, launch, their, first, strike, in, europe, according, to, general, mark, w, clark, the, americans, admitted, a, cross, channel, operation, in, the, near, future, was, utterly, impossible, as, an, alternative, churchill, recommended, slit, ting, the, soft, belly, of, the, mediterranean, and, persuaded, them, to, invade, sicily, and, then, mainland, italy, after, they, had, defeated, the, afrika, korps, after, the, war, clark, still, agreed, churchill, s, analysis, was, correct, but, added, that, when, the, allies, landed, at, salerno, they, found, italy, was, a, tough, old, gut, the, invasion, of, sicily, began, on, 9, july, and, was, completed, by, 17, august, churchill, was, not, keen, on, overlord, as, he, feared, an, anglo, american, army, in, france, might, not, be, a, match, for, the, fighting, efficiency, of, the, wehrmacht, he, preferred, peripheral, operations, including, a, plan, called, operation, jupiter, for, an, invasion, of, norway, events, in, sicily, had, an, unexpected, impact, in, italy, king, victor, emmanuel, sacked, mussolini, on, 25, july, and, appointed, marshal, badoglio, as, prime, minister, badoglio, opened, negotiations, with, the, allies, which, resulted, in, the, armistice, of, cassibile, on, 3, september, in, response, the, germans, activated, operation, achse, and, took, control, of, most, of, italy, although, he, still, preferred, italy, to, normandy, as, the, allies, main, route, into, the, third, reich, churchill, was, concerned, about, the, strong, german, resistance, at, salerno, and, after, the, allies, successfully, gained, their, bridgehead, at, anzio, but, still, failed, to, break, the, stalemate, he, caustically, said, that, instead, of, hurling, a, wildcat, onto, the, shore, the, allied, force, had, become, a, stranded, whale, the, big, obstacle, was, monte, cassino, and, it, was, not, until, may, 1944, when, it, was, finally, overcome, enabling, the, allies, to, advance, on, rome, which, was, taken, on, 4, june, the, difficulties, in, italy, caused, churchill, to, change, heart, about, strategy, when, the, anzio, stalemate, developed, after, his, return, to, england, from, north, africa, he, threw, himself, into, the, planning, of, overlord, and, set, up, meetings, with, shaef, and, the, british, chiefs, of, staff, these, were, attended, by, eisenhower, or, his, chief, of, staff, general, walter, bedell, smith, churchill, was, especially, taken, by, the, mulberry, harbours, but, was, keen, to, make, the, most, of, allied, airpower, which, by, 1944, had, become, overwhelming, churchill, never, lost, his, apprehension, about, the, invasion, and, underwent, mood, fluctuation, as, d, day, approached, jenkins, says, he, faced, potential, victory, with, much, less, buoyancy, than, when, he, defiantly, faced, the, prospect, of, defeat, four, years, earlier, churchill, could, not, ignore, the, need, for, post, war, reforms, the, beveridge, report, with, its, five, giant, evils, was, published, in, november, 1942, and, assumed, great, importance, amid, popular, acclaim, even, so, churchill, spent, most, of, his, focus, on, the, war, and, saw, reform, in, terms, of, tidying, up, his, attitude, was, demonstrated, in, a, radio, broadcast, on, 26, march, 1944, he, was, obliged, to, devote, most, of, it, to, reform, and, showed, a, distinct, lack, of, interest, colville, said, churchill, had, broadcast, indifferently, and, harold, nicolson, said, that, to, many, people, churchill, came, across, the, air, as, a, worn, and, petulant, old, man, in, the, end, however, it, was, demand, for, reform, that, decided, the, 1945, general, election, labour, was, perceived, as, the, party, that, would, deliver, beveridge, attlee, bevin, and, labour, s, other, coalition, ministers, were, seen, as, working, towards, reform, and, earned, the, trust, of, the, electorate, churchill, was, determined, to, be, actively, involved, in, the, normandy, invasion, and, hoped, to, cross, the, channel, on, d, day, 6, june, 1944, or, at, least, d, day, 1, his, desire, caused, unnecessary, consternation, at, shaef, until, he, was, effectively, vetoed, by, the, king, churchill, expected, an, allied, death, toll, of, 20, 000, on, d, day, but, fewer, than, 8, 000, died, in, all, of, june, he, made, his, first, visit, to, normandy, on, 12, june, to, visit, montgomery, whose, hq, was, five, miles, inland, that, evening, as, he, was, returning, to, london, the, first, v, 1, flying, bombs, were, launched, on, 22, 23, july, churchill, went, to, cherbourg, and, arromanches, where, he, saw, the, mulberry, harbour, churchill, met, roosevelt, at, the, second, quebec, conference, in, september, 1944, they, reached, agreement, on, the, morgenthau, plan, for, the, allied, occupation, of, germany, the, intention, of, which, was, not, only, to, demilitarise, but, de, industrialise, eden, opposed, it, and, was, able, to, persuade, churchill, to, disown, it, us, secretary, of, state, cordell, hull, opposed, it, and, convinced, roosevelt, it, was, infeasible, at, the, fourth, moscow, conference, in, october, 1944, churchill, and, eden, met, stalin, and, molotov, this, conference, has, gained, notoriety, for, the, so, called, percentages, agreement, in, which, churchill, and, stalin, effectively, agreed, the, post, war, fate, of, the, balkans, by, then, the, soviet, armies, were, in, rumania, and, bulgaria, churchill, suggested, a, scale, of, predominance, throughout, the, whole, region, so, as, not, to, as, he, put, it, get, at, cross, purposes, in, small, ways, he, wrote, down, some, suggested, percentages, of, influence, per, country, and, gave, it, to, stalin, who, ticked, it, the, agreement, was, that, russia, would, have, 90, control, of, romania, and, 75, control, of, bulgaria, the, united, kingdom, and, united, states, would, have, 90, control, of, greece, hungary, and, yugoslavia, would, be, 50, each, in, 1958, five, years, after, the, account, of, this, meeting, was, published, in, the, second, world, war, soviet, authorities, denied, stalin, had, accepted, such, an, imperialist, proposal, from, 30, january, to, 2, february, 1945, churchill, and, roosevelt, met, for, their, malta, conference, ahead, of, the, second, big, three, event, at, yalta, from, 4, to, 11, february, yalta, had, massive, implications, for, the, post, war, world, there, were, two, predominant, issues, the, question, of, setting, up, the, united, nations, organisation, on, which, much, progress, was, made, and, the, more, vexed, question, of, poland, s, post, war, status, which, churchill, saw, as, a, test, case, for, eastern, europe, churchill, faced, criticism, for, the, agreement, on, poland, for, example, 27, tory, mps, voted, against, him, when, the, matter, was, debated, in, the, commons, at, the, end, of, the, month, jenkins, however, maintains, that, churchill, did, as, well, as, possible, in, difficult, circumstances, not, least, the, fact, that, roosevelt, was, seriously, ill, and, could, not, provide, churchill, with, meaningful, support, another, outcome, of, yalta, was, the, so, called, operation, keelhaul, the, western, allies, agreed, to, the, forcible, repatriation, of, all, soviet, citizens, in, the, allied, zones, including, prisoners, of, war, to, the, soviet, union, and, the, policy, was, later, extended, to, all, eastern, european, refugees, many, of, whom, were, anti, communist, keelhaul, was, implemented, between, august, 1946, and, may, 1947, on, the, nights, of, 13, 15, february, 1945, 1, 200, british, and, us, bombers, attacked, dresden, which, was, crowded, with, wounded, and, refugees, from, the, eastern, front, the, attacks, were, part, of, an, area, bombing, campaign, initiated, by, churchill, in, january, with, the, intention, of, shortening, the, war, churchill, came, to, regret, the, bombing, because, initial, reports, suggested, an, excessive, number, of, civilian, casualties, close, to, the, end, of, the, war, though, an, independent, commission, in, 2010, confirmed, a, death, toll, of, about, 24, 000, on, 28, march, he, decided, to, restrict, area, bombing, and, sent, a, memo, to, general, ismay, for, the, chiefs, of, staff, committee, the, destruction, of, dresden, remains, a, serious, query, against, the, conduct, of, allied, bombing, i, feel, the, need, for, more, precise, concentration, upon, military, objectives, rather, than, on, mere, acts, of, terror, and, wanton, destruction, however, impressive, historian, frederick, taylor, has, pointed, out, that, the, number, of, soviets, who, died, from, german, bombing, was, roughly, equivalent, to, the, number, of, germans, who, died, from, allied, raids, jenkins, asks, if, churchill, was, moved, more, by, foreboding, than, by, regret, but, admits, it, is, easy, to, criticise, with, the, hindsight, of, victory, he, adds, that, the, area, bombing, campaign, was, no, more, reprehensible, than, president, truman, s, use, of, the, second, atomic, bomb, on, nagasaki, six, months, later, andrew, marr, quoting, max, hastings, says, that, churchill, s, memo, was, a, calculated, political, attempt, to, distance, himself, from, the, rising, controversy, surrounding, the, area, offensive, on, 7, may, 1945, at, the, shaef, headquarters, in, reims, the, allies, accepted, germany, s, surrender, the, next, day, was, victory, in, europe, day, ve, day, when, churchill, broadcast, to, the, nation, that, germany, had, surrendered, and, that, a, final, ceasefire, would, come, into, effect, at, one, minute, past, midnight, that, night, churchill, went, to, buckingham, palace, where, he, appeared, on, the, balcony, with, the, royal, family, before, a, huge, crowd, of, celebrating, citizens, he, went, from, the, palace, to, whitehall, where, he, addressed, another, large, crowd, god, bless, you, all, this, is, your, victory, in, our, long, history, we, have, never, seen, a, greater, day, than, this, everyone, man, or, woman, has, done, their, best, he, asked, bevin, to, come, forward, and, share, the, applause, bevin, said, no, winston, this, is, your, day, and, proceeded, to, conduct, the, people, in, the, singing, of, for, he, s, a, jolly, good, fellow, in, the, evening, churchill, made, another, broadcast, correctly, asserting, that, the, defeat, of, japan, would, follow, in, the, coming, months, later, in, the, month, france, attempted, to, put, down, a, nationalist, uprising, in, the, syria, churchill, intervened, and, on, 31, may, gave, de, gaulle, an, ultimatum, to, desist, but, this, was, ignored, in, what, became, known, as, the, levant, crisis, british, forces, from, transjordan, were, mobilised, to, restore, order, the, french, outnumbered, had, no, option, but, to, return, to, their, bases, de, gaulle, felt, humiliated, and, a, diplomatic, row, broke, out, churchill, reportedly, told, a, colleague, that, de, gaulle, was, a, great, danger, to, peace, and, for, great, britain, in, may, 1945, winston, churchill, commissioned, the, chiefs, of, staff, committee, to, provide, its, thoughts, on, a, possible, military, campaign, against, the, ussr, code, named, operation, unthinkable, one, plan, involved, a, surprise, attack, on, soviet, troops, stationed, in, germany, to, impose, the, will, of, the, united, states, and, the, british, empire, on, the, soviets, the, hypothetical, start, date, for, the, allied, invasion, of, soviet, held, europe, was, set, for, 1, july, 1945, with, a, general, election, looming, and, with, labour, ministers, refusing, to, continue, the, coalition, churchill, resigned, as, prime, minister, on, 23, may, 1945, later, that, day, he, accepted, the, king, s, invitation, to, form, a, new, government, known, officially, as, the, national, government, but, sometimes, called, the, caretaker, ministry, it, contained, conservatives, national, liberals, and, a, few, non, party, figures, such, as, sir, john, anderson, and, lord, woolton, but, not, labour, or, archibald, sinclair, s, official, liberals, churchill, was, formally, reappointed, on, 28, may, churchill, was, great, britain, s, representative, at, the, potsdam, conference, when, it, opened, on, 17, july, and, was, accompanied, at, its, sessions, by, eden, and, attlee, they, attended, nine, sessions, in, nine, days, before, returning, to, england, for, their, election, counts, after, the, landslide, labour, victory, attlee, returned, with, bevin, as, the, new, foreign, secretary, and, there, were, five, days, of, discussion, potsdam, went, badly, for, churchill, eden, later, described, his, performance, as, appalling, saying, he, was, unprepared, and, verbose, churchill, upset, the, chinese, exasperated, the, americans, and, was, easily, led, by, stalin, whom, he, was, supposed, to, be, resisting, churchill, mishandled, the, election, campaign, by, resorting, to, party, politics, and, trying, to, denigrate, labour, on, 4, june, he, committed, a, serious, gaffe, by, saying, in, a, radio, broadcast, that, a, labour, government, would, require, some, form, of, gestapo, to, enforce, its, agenda, it, backfired, and, attlee, made, political, capital, by, saying, in, his, reply, broadcast, next, day, the, voice, we, heard, last, night, was, that, of, mr, churchill, but, the, mind, was, that, of, lord, beaverbrook, jenkins, says, that, this, broadcast, was, the, making, of, attlee, although, polling, day, was, 5, july, the, results, did, not, become, known, until, 26, july, owing, to, the, need, to, collect, votes, of, those, serving, overseas, clementine, and, daughter, mary, had, been, at, the, count, in, woodford, churchill, s, new, constituency, and, had, returned, to, downing, street, to, meet, him, for, lunch, churchill, was, unopposed, by, the, major, parties, in, woodford, but, his, majority, over, a, sole, independent, candidate, was, much, less, than, expected, he, anticipated, defeat, by, labour, and, mary, later, described, the, lunch, as, an, occasion, of, stygian, gloom, to, clementine, s, suggestion, that, defeat, might, be, a, blessing, in, disguise, churchill, retorted, at, the, moment, it, seems, very, effectively, disguised, that, afternoon, churchill, s, doctor, lord, moran, commiserated, with, him, on, the, ingratitude, of, the, public, to, which, churchill, replied, i, wouldn, t, call, it, that, they, have, had, a, very, hard, time, having, lost, despite, enjoying, personal, support, amongst, the, population, he, resigned, as, prime, minister, and, was, succeeded, by, attlee, who, formed, the, first, majority, labour, government, many, reasons, have, been, given, for, churchill, s, defeat, key, being, a, widespread, desire, for, reform, and, that, the, man, who, had, led, britain, in, war, was, not, seen, as, the, man, to, lead, in, peace, although, the, conservative, party, was, unpopular, many, electors, appear, to, have, wanted, churchill, to, continue, as, prime, minister, whatever, the, outcome, or, to, have, wrongly, believed, this, would, be, possible, churchill, continued, to, lead, the, conservative, party, and, served, as, leader, of, the, opposition, in, 1946, he, was, in, america, from, early, january, to, late, march, it, was, on, this, trip, he, gave, his, iron, curtain, speech, about, the, ussr, and, its, creation, of, the, eastern, bloc, speaking, on, 5, march, 1946, in, the, company, of, president, truman, at, westminster, college, in, fulton, missouri, churchill, declared, from, stettin, in, the, baltic, to, trieste, in, the, adriatic, an, iron, curtain, has, descended, across, the, continent, behind, that, line, lie, all, the, capitals, of, the, ancient, states, of, central, and, eastern, europe, warsaw, berlin, prague, vienna, budapest, belgrade, bucharest, and, sofia, all, these, famous, cities, and, the, populations, around, them, lie, in, what, i, must, call, the, soviet, sphere, his, view, was, that, though, the, soviet, union, did, not, want, war, with, the, western, allies, its, entrenched, position, in, eastern, europe, had, made, it, impossible, for, the, three, great, powers, to, provide, the, world, with, a, triangular, leadership, churchill, s, desire, was, much, closer, collaboration, between, britain, and, america, within, the, same, speech, he, called, for, a, special, relationship, between, the, british, commonwealth, and, empire, and, the, united, states, but, emphasised, the, need, for, co, operation, within, the, framework, of, the, united, nations, charter, churchill, was, an, early, proponent, of, pan, europeanism, having, called, for, a, united, states, of, europe, in, a, 1930, article, he, supported, the, creations, of, the, council, of, europe, in, 1949, and, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, in, 1951, but, his, support, was, always, with, the, firm, proviso, that, britain, must, not, actually, join, any, federal, grouping, having, lived, in, ireland, as, a, child, churchill, always, opposed, its, partition, as, a, minister, in, 1913, and, again, in, 1921, he, suggested, that, ulster, should, be, part, of, a, united, ireland, but, with, a, degree, of, autonomy, from, an, independent, irish, government, he, was, always, opposed, on, this, by, ulster, unionists, while, he, was, leader, of, the, opposition, he, told, john, dulanty, and, frederick, boland, successive, irish, ambassadors, to, london, that, he, still, hoped, for, reunification, labour, won, the, 1950, general, election, but, with, a, much, reduced, majority, a, fresh, election, was, called, the, following, year, and, the, conservatives, won, a, majority, despite, losing, the, popular, vote, the, conservatives, won, a, majority, of, 17, seats, in, the, october, 1951, general, election, and, churchill, became, prime, minister, remaining, in, office, until, his, resignation, on, 5, april, 1955, eden, his, eventual, successor, was, restored, to, foreign, affairs, future, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, was, appointed, minister, of, housing, and, local, government, with, a, manifesto, commitment, to, build, 300, 000, new, houses, per, year, churchill, s, only, real, domestic, concern, he, achieved, the, target, and, in, 1954, was, promoted, to, minister, of, defence, churchill, was, nearly, 77, when, he, took, office, and, not, in, good, health, following, minor, strokes, by, december, 1951, george, vi, had, become, concerned, about, churchill, s, decline, and, intended, asking, him, to, stand, down, in, favour, of, eden, but, the, king, had, his, own, health, issues, and, died, on, 6, february, 1952, churchill, developed, a, friendship, with, elizabeth, ii, and, in, spring, 1953, accepted, the, order, of, the, garter, at, her, request, he, was, knighted, as, sir, winston, on, 24, april, 1953, it, was, widely, expected, he, would, retire, after, the, queen, s, coronation, in, june, 1953, but, after, eden, became, seriously, ill, churchill, increased, his, own, responsibilities, by, taking, over, at, the, foreign, office, eden, was, incapacitated, until, the, end, of, the, year, and, never, completely, well, again, on, the, evening, of, 23, june, 1953, churchill, suffered, a, serious, stroke, the, matter, was, kept, secret, and, churchill, went, to, chartwell, to, recuperate, he, had, recovered, by, november, he, retired, in, april, 1955, and, was, succeeded, by, eden, churchill, feared, a, global, conflagration, and, firmly, believed, the, only, way, to, preserve, peace, and, freedom, was, friendship, and, co, operation, between, britain, and, america, he, made, four, official, transatlantic, visits, from, january, 1952, to, july, 1954, he, enjoyed, a, good, relationship, with, truman, but, difficulties, arose, over, the, planned, european, defence, community, edc, by, which, truman, hoped, to, reduce, america, s, military, presence, in, west, germany, churchill, wanted, us, military, support, of, british, interests, in, egypt, and, the, middle, east, but, while, truman, expected, british, military, involvement, in, korea, he, viewed, any, us, commitment, to, the, middle, east, as, maintaining, british, imperialism, the, americans, recognised, the, british, empire, was, in, terminal, decline, and, had, welcomed, the, attlee, government, s, policy, of, decolonisation, churchill, believed, britain, s, position, as, a, world, power, depended, on, the, empire, s, continued, existence, churchill, had, been, obliged, to, recognise, colonel, nasser, s, revolutionary, government, of, egypt, which, took, power, in, 1952, much, to, churchill, s, dismay, agreement, was, reached, in, october, 1954, on, the, phased, evacuation, of, british, troops, from, their, suez, base, britain, agreed, to, terminate, its, rule, in, anglo, egyptian, sudan, by, 1956, though, this, was, in, return, for, nasser, s, abandonment, of, egyptian, claims, over, the, region, elsewhere, the, malayan, emergency, a, guerrilla, war, fought, by, communist, fighters, against, commonwealth, forces, had, begun, in, 1948, and, continued, until, 1960, churchill, s, government, maintained, the, military, response, to, the, crisis, and, adopted, a, similar, strategy, for, the, mau, mau, uprising, in, british, kenya, 1952, 1960, churchill, was, uneasy, about, the, election, of, eisenhower, as, truman, s, successor, after, stalin, died, in, march, 1953, churchill, sought, a, summit, meeting, with, the, soviets, but, eisenhower, refused, out, of, fear, the, soviets, would, use, it, for, propaganda, by, july, churchill, was, deeply, regretting, that, the, democrats, had, not, been, returned, churchill, believed, eisenhower, did, not, fully, comprehend, the, danger, posed, by, the, h, bomb, and, he, greatly, distrusted, eisenhower, s, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, churchill, hosted, eisenhower, at, the, three, powers, bermuda, conference, with, french, prime, minister, joseph, laniel, in, december, they, met, again, in, june, july, 1954, at, the, white, house, in, the, end, the, soviets, proposed, a, four, power, summit, but, it, did, not, meet, until, july, 1955, three, months, after, churchill, s, retirement, elizabeth, ii, offered, to, create, churchill, duke, of, london, but, he, declined, because, of, the, objections, of, randolph, who, would, have, inherited, the, title, although, publicly, supportive, churchill, was, privately, scathing, about, eden, s, handling, of, the, suez, crisis, and, clementine, believed, that, many, of, his, visits, to, the, us, in, the, following, years, were, attempts, to, repair, anglo, american, relations, churchill, remained, an, mp, until, he, stood, down, at, the, 1964, general, election, by, the, time, of, the, 1959, general, election, he, seldom, attended, the, house, of, commons, despite, the, conservative, landslide, in, 1959, his, own, majority, fell, by, more, than, 1, 000, he, spent, most, of, his, retirement, at, chartwell, or, at, his, london, home, in, hyde, park, gate, and, became, a, habitu, of, high, society, at, la, pausa, on, the, french, riviera, in, june, 1962, aged, 87, churchill, had, a, fall, in, monte, carlo, and, broke, his, hip, he, was, flown, home, to, a, london, hospital, where, he, remained, for, 3, weeks, jenkins, says, churchill, was, never, the, same, after, this, in, 1963, us, president, john, f, kennedy, acting, under, authorisation, granted, by, an, act, of, congress, proclaimed, him, an, honorary, citizen, of, the, united, states, but, he, was, unable, to, attend, the, white, house, ceremony, there, has, been, speculation, he, became, very, depressed, in, his, final, years, but, this, has, been, emphatically, denied, by, his, secretary, anthony, montague, browne, who, was, with, him, for, his, last, 10, years, montague, browne, wrote, that, he, never, heard, churchill, refer, to, depression, and, certainly, did, not, suffer, from, it, churchill, suffered, his, final, stroke, on, 10, january, 1965, and, died, on, 24, january, like, the, duke, of, wellington, in, 1852, and, william, gladstone, in, 1898, churchill, was, given, a, state, funeral, his, coffin, lay, in, state, at, westminster, hall, for, three, days, the, funeral, ceremony, was, at, st, paul, s, cathedral, on, 30, january, afterwards, the, coffin, was, taken, by, boat, along, the, river, thames, to, waterloo, station, and, from, there, by, a, special, train, to, the, family, plot, at, st, martin, s, church, bladon, worldwide, numerous, memorials, have, been, dedicated, to, churchill, his, statue, in, parliament, square, was, unveiled, by, his,

of, historical, and, biographical, description, and, oratorial, output, churchill, received, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, in, 1953, he, used, either, winston, s, churchill, or, winston, spencer, churchill, as, his, pen, name, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, american, novelist, winston, churchill, whom, he, had, a, friendly, correspondence, with, for, many, years, he, relied, on, his, press, articles, to, assuage, his, financial, worries, churchill, became, an, accomplished, amateur, artist, beginning, after, his, resignation, from, the, admiralty, in, 1915, often, using, the, pseudonym,

saying, that, dogs, look, up, to, you, cats, look, down, on, you, give, me, a, pig, he, looks, you, in, the, eye, and, treats, you, as, an, equal, jenkins, concludes, his, biography, of, churchill, by, comparing, him, favourably, with, william, gladstone, and, summarising, i, now, put, churchill, with, all, his, idiosyncrasies, his, indulgences, his, occasional, childishness, but, also, his, genius, his, tenacity, and, his, persistent, ability, right, or, wrong, successful, or, unsuccessful, to, be, larger, than, life, as, the, greatest, human, being, ever, to, occupy, 10, downing, street, churchill, always, self, confidently, believed, himself, to, be, a, man, of, destiny, because, of, this, he, lacked, restraint, and, could, be, reckless, his, self, belief, manifested, in, his, affinity, with, war, of, which, according, to, sebastian, haffner, he, exhibited, a, profound, and, innate, understanding, churchill, considered, himself, a, military, genius, but, that, made, him, vulnerable, to, failure, and, paul, addison, says, the, gallipoli, disaster, was, the, greatest, blow, his, self, image, was, ever, to, sustain, jenkins, points, out, that, although, churchill, was, exhilarated, by, war, he, was, never, indifferent, to, the, suffering, it, causes, as, a, politician, churchill, was, perceived, by, some, to, have, been, largely, motivated, by, personal, ambition, rather, than, political, principle, during, his, early, career, he, was, often, provocative, and, argumentative, to, an, unusual, degree, and, his, barbed, rhetorical, style, earned, him, enemies, in, parliament, on, the, other, hand, he, was, deemed, to, be, an, honest, politician, who, displayed, particular, loyalty, to, his, family, and, close, friends, robert, rhodes, james, said, he, lacked, any, capacity, for, intrigue, and, was, refreshingly, innocent, and, straightforward, until, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, churchill, s, approach, to, politics, generated, widespread, mistrust, and, dislike, largely, on, account, of, his, two, party, defections, his, biographers, have, variously, categorised, him, in, terms, of, political, ideology, as, fundamentally, conservative, always, liberal, in, outlook, and, never, circumscribed, by, party, affiliation, he, was, nearly, always, opposed, to, socialism, because, of, its, propensity, for, state, planning, and, his, belief, in, free, markets, the, exception, was, during, his, wartime, coalition, when, he, was, reliant, upon, the, support, of, his, labour, colleagues, churchill, had, long, been, regarded, as, an, enemy, of, the, working, class, and, his, response, to, the, rhondda, valley, unrest, and, his, anti, socialist, rhetoric, brought, condemnation, from, socialists, who, saw, him, as, a, reactionary, his, role, in, opposing, the, general, strike, earned, the, enmity, of, strikers, and, most, members, of, the, labour, movement, paradoxically, churchill, was, supportive, of, trade, unionism, which, he, saw, as, the, antithesis, of, socialism, on, the, other, hand, his, detractors, did, not, take, churchill, s, domestic, reforms, into, account, for, he, was, in, many, respects, a, radical, and, reformer, but, always, with, the, intention, of, preserving, the, existing, social, structure, displaying, what, addison, calls, the, attitude, of, a, benevolent, paternalist, jenkins, himself, a, senior, labour, minister, remarked, that, churchill, had, a, substantial, record, as, a, social, reformer, for, his, work, in, his, ministerial, career, similarly, rhodes, james, thought, that, churchill, s, achievements, were, considerable, churchill, was, a, staunch, imperialist, and, monarchist, and, consistently, exhibited, a, romanticised, view, of, the, british, empire, and, reigning, monarch, especially, during, his, last, term, as, premier, churchill, has, been, described, as, a, liberal, imperialist, who, saw, british, imperialism, as, a, form, of, altruism, that, benefited, its, subject, peoples, he, advocated, against, black, or, indigenous, self, rule, in, africa, australia, the, caribbean, the, americas, and, india, believing, the, british, empire, maintained, the, welfare, of, those, who, lived, in, the, colonies, according, to, addison, churchill, was, opposed, to, immigration, from, the, commonwealth, addison, makes, the, point, that, churchill, opposed, anti, semitism, as, in, 1904, when, he, was, critical, of, the, proposed, aliens, bill, and, argues, he, would, never, have, tried, to, stoke, up, racial, animosity, against, immigrants, or, to, persecute, minorities, in, the, 1920s, churchill, supported, zionism, but, believed, that, communism, was, the, product, of, an, international, jewish, conspiracy, although, this, belief, was, not, unique, among, politicians, few, had, his, stature, and, the, article, he, wrote, on, the, subject, was, criticised, by, the, jewish, chronicle, churchill, made, disparaging, remarks, about, non, white, ethnicities, throughout, his, life, philip, murphy, partly, attributes, the, strength, of, this, vitriol, to, an, almost, childish, desire, to, shock, his, inner, circle, churchill, s, response, to, the, bengal, famine, was, criticised, by, contemporaries, as, slow, a, controversy, later, increased, by, the, publication, of, private, remarks, made, to, secretary, for, india, leo, amery, in, which, churchill, allegedly, said, aid, would, be, inadequate, because, indians, breeding, like, rabbits, philip, murphy, says, that, following, the, independence, of, india, in, 1947, churchill, adopted, a, pragmatic, stance, towards, empire, although, he, continued, to, use, imperial, rhetoric, during, his, second, term, as, prime, minister, he, was, seen, as, a, moderating, influence, on, britain, s, suppression, of, armed, insurgencies, in, malaya, and, kenya, he, argued, that, ruthless, policies, contradicted, british, values, and, international, opinion, while, biographies, by, addison, gilbert, jenkins, and, rhodes, james, are, among, the, most, acclaimed, works, about, churchill, he, has, been, the, subject, of, numerous, others, david, freeman,
