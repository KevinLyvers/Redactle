those, of, any, other, playwright, today, his, influence, is, such, that, the, french, language, is, often, referred, to, as, the, language, of, moli, re, born, into, a, prosperous, family, and, having, studied, at, the, coll, ge, de, clermont, now, lyc, e, louis, le, grand, moli, re, was, well, suited, to, begin, a, life, in, the, theatre, thirteen, years, as, an, itinerant, actor, helped, him, polish, his, comedic, abilities, while, he, began, writing, combining, commedia, dell, arte, elements, with, the, more, refined, french, comedy, through, the, patronage, of, aristocrats, including, philippe, i, duke, of, orl, ans, the, brother, of, louis, xiv, moli, re, procured, a, command, performance, before, the, king, at, the, louvre, performing, a, classic, play, by, pierre,

continued, as, the, official, author, of, court, entertainments, despite, the, adulation, of, the, court, and, parisians, moli, re, s, satires, attracted, criticism, from, other, circles, for, tartuffe, s, impiety, the, catholic, church, in, france, denounced, this, study, of, religious, hypocrisy, which, was, followed, by, a, ban, by, the, parlement, while, dom, juan, was, withdrawn, and, never, restaged, by, moli, re, his, hard, work, in, so, many, theatrical, capacities, took, its, toll, on, his, health, and, by, 1667, he, was, forced, to, take, a, break, from, the, stage, in, 1673, during, a, production, of, his, final, play, the, imaginary, invalid, moli, re, who, suffered, from, pulmonary, tuberculosis, was, seized, by, a, coughing, fit, and, a, haemorrhage, while, playing, the, hypochondriac, argan, he, finished, the, performance, but, collapsed, again, and, died, a, few, hours, later, moli, re, was, born, in, paris, shortly, before, his, christening, as, jean, poquelin, on, 15, january, 1622, known, as, jean, baptiste, he, was, the, first, son, of, jean, poquelin, and, marie, cress, who, had, married, on, 27, april, 1621, his, mother, was, the, daughter, of, a, prosperous, bourgeois, family, upon, seeing, him, for, the, first, time, a, maid, exclaimed, le, nez, a, reference, to, the, infant, s, large, nose, moli, re, was, called, le, nez, by, his, family, from, that, time, he, lost, his, mother, when, he, was, 10, and, he, does, not, seem, to, have, been, particularly, close, to, his, father, after, his, mother, s, death, he, lived, with, his, father, above, the, pavillon, des, singes, on, the, rue, saint, honor, an, affluent, area, of, paris, it, is, likely, that, his, education, commenced, with, studies, at, a, parisian, elementary, school, followed, by, his, enrollment, in, the, prestigious, jesuit, coll, ge, de, clermont, where, he, completed, his, studies, in, a, strict, academic, environment, and, got, a, first, taste, of, life, on, the, stage, in, 1631, his, father, jean, poquelin, purchased, from, the, court, of, louis, xiii, the, posts, of, valet, de, chambre, ordinaire, et, tapissier, du, roi, valet, of, the, king, s, chamber, and, keeper, of, carpets, and, upholstery, his, son, assumed, the, same, posts, in, 1641, the, title, required, only, three, months, work, and, an, initial, cost, of, 1, 200, livres, the, title, paid, 300, livres, a, year, and, provided, a, number, of, lucrative, contracts, moli, re, also, studied, as, a, provincial, lawyer, some, time, around, 1642, probably, in, orl, ans, but, it, is, not, documented, that, he, ever, qualified, so, far, he, had, followed, his, father, s, plans, which, had, served, him, well, he, had, mingled, with, nobility, at, the, coll, ge, de, clermont, and, seemed, destined, for, a, career, in, office, in, june, 1643, when, moli, re, was, 21, he, decided, to, abandon, his, social, class, and, pursue, a, career, on, the, stage, taking, leave, of, his, father, he, joined, the, actress, madeleine, b, jart, with, whom, he, had, crossed, paths, before, and, founded, the, illustre, th, tre, with, 630, livres, they, were, later, joined, by, madeleine, s, brother, and, sister, the, theatre, troupe, went, bankrupt, in, 1645, moli, re, had, become, head, of, the, troupe, due, in, part, perhaps, to, his, acting, prowess, and, his, legal, training, however, the, troupe, had, acquired, large, debts, mostly, for, the, rent, of, the, theatre, a, court, for, jeu, de, paume, for, which, they, owed, 2000, livres, historians, differ, as, to, whether, his, father, or, the, lover, of, a, member, of, his, troupe, paid, his, debts, either, way, after, a, 24, hour, stint, in, prison, he, returned, to, the, acting, circuit, it, was, at, this, time, that, he, began, to, use, the, pseudonym, moli, re, possibly, inspired, by, a, small, village, of, the, same, name, in, the, midi, near, le, vigan, it, was, likely, that, he, changed, his, name, to, spare, his, father, the, shame, of, having, an, actor, in, the, family, actors, although, no, longer, vilified, by, the, state, under, louis, xiv, were, still, not, allowed, to, be, buried, in, sacred, ground, after, his, imprisonment, he, and, madeleine, began, a, theatrical, circuit, of, the, provinces, with, a, new, theatre, troupe, this, life, was, to, last, about, twelve, years, during, which, he, initially, played, in, the, company, of, charles, dufresne, and, subsequently, created, a, company, of, his, own, which, had, sufficient, success, and, obtained, the, patronage, of, philippe, i, duke, of, orl, ans, few, plays, survive, from, this, period, the, most, noteworthy, are, l, tourdi, ou, les, contretemps, the, bungler, and, le, docteur, amoureux, the, doctor, in, love, with, these, two, plays, moli, re, moved, away, from, the, heavy, influence, of, the, italian, improvisational, commedia, dell, arte, and, displayed, his, talent, for, mockery, in, the, course, of, his, travels, he, met, armand, prince, of, conti, the, governor, of, languedoc, who, became, his, patron, and, named, his, company, after, him, this, friendship, later, ended, when, armand, having, contracted, syphilis, from, a, courtesan, turned, toward, religion, and, joined, moli, re, s, enemies, in, the, parti, des, d, vots, and, the, compagnie, de, saint, sacrement, in, lyon, mademoiselle, du, parc, known, as, marquise, joined, the, company, marquise, was, courted, in, vain, by, pierre, corneille, and, later, became, the, lover, of, jean, racine, racine, offered, moli, re, his, tragedy, th, ag, ne, et, charicl, e, one, of, the, early, works, he, wrote, after, he, had, abandoned, his, theology, studies, but, moli, re, would, not, perform, it, though, he, encouraged, racine, to, pursue, his, artistic, career, moli, re, was, forced, to, reach, paris, in, stages, staying, outside, for, a, few, weeks, in, order, to, promote, himself, with, society, gentlemen, and, allow, his, reputation, to, feed, in, to, paris, moli, re, reached, paris, in, 1658, and, performed, in, front, of, the, king, at, the, louvre, then, for, rent, as, a, theatre, in, corneille, s, tragedy, nicom, de, and, in, the, farce, le, docteur, amoureux, with, some, success, he, was, awarded, the, title, of, troupe, de, monsieur, monsieur, being, the, honorific, for, the, king, s, brother, philippe, i, duke, of, orl, ans, with, the, help, of, monsieur, his, company, was, allowed, to, share, the, theatre, in, the, large, hall, of, the, petit, bourbon, with, the, italian, commedia, dell, arte, company, of, tiberio, fiorillo, famous, for, the, character, of, scaramouche, the, two, companies, performed, in, the, theatre, on, different, nights, the, premiere, of, moli, re, s, les, pr, cieuses, ridicules, the, affected, young, ladies, took, place, at, the, petit, bourbon, on, 18, november, 1659, les, pr, cieuses, ridicules, was, the, first, of, moli, re, s, many, attempts, to, satirize, certain, societal, mannerisms, and, affectations, then, common, in, france, it, is, widely, accepted, that, the, plot, was, based, on, samuel, chappuzeau, s, le, cercle, des, femmes, of, 1656, he, primarily, mocks, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, a, group, created, by, richelieu, under, a, royal, patent, to, establish, the, rules, of, the, fledgling, french, theatre, the, acad, mie, preached, unity, of, time, action, and, styles, of, verse, moli, re, is, often, associated, with, the, claim, that, comedy, castigat, ridendo, mores, or, criticises, customs, through, humour, a, phrase, in, fact, coined, by, his, contemporary, jean, de, santeuil, and, sometimes, mistaken, for, a, classical, latin, proverb, despite, his, own, preference, for, tragedy, which, he, had, tried, to, further, with, the, illustre, th, tre, moli, re, became, famous, for, his, farces, which, were, generally, in, one, act, and, performed, after, the, tragedy, some, of, these, farces, were, only, partly, written, and, were, played, in, the, style, of, commedia, dell, arte, with, improvisation, over, a, canovaccio, a, vague, plot, outline, he, began, to, write, full, five, act, comedies, in, verse, l, tourdi, lyon, 1654, and, le, d, pit, amoureux, b, ziers, 1656, which, although, immersed, in, the, gags, of, contemporary, italian, troupes, were, successful, as, part, of, madeleine, b, jart, and, moli, re, s, plans, to, win, aristocratic, patronage, and, ultimately, move, the, troupe, to, a, position, in, a, paris, theater, venue, later, moli, re, concentrated, on, writing, musical, comedies, in, which, the, drama, is, interrupted, by, songs, and, or, dances, but, for, years, the, fundamentals, of, numerous, comedy, traditions, would, remain, strong, especially, italian, e, g, the, semi, improvisatory, style, that, in, the, 1750s, writers, started, calling, commedia, dell, arte, spanish, and, french, plays, all, also, drawing, on, classical, models, e, g, plautus, and, terence, especially, the, trope, of, the, clever, slave, servant, les, pr, cieuses, ridicules, won, moli, re, the, attention, and, the, criticism, of, many, but, it, was, not, a, popular, success, he, then, asked, fiorillo, to, teach, him, the, techniques, of, commedia, dell, arte, his, 1660, play, sganarelle, ou, le, cocu, imaginaire, the, imaginary, cuckold, seems, to, be, a, tribute, both, to, commedia, dell, arte, and, to, his, teacher, its, theme, of, marital, relationships, dramatizes, moli, re, s, pessimistic, views, on, the, falsity, inherent, in, human, relationships, this, view, is, also, evident, in, his, later, works, and, was, a, source, of, inspiration, for, many, later, authors, including, with, different, effect, 20th, century, nobel, prize, winner, luigi, pirandello, it, describes, a, kind, of, round, dance, where, two, couples, believe, that, each, of, their, partners, has, been, betrayed, by, the, other, s, and, is, the, first, in, moli, re, s, jealousy, series, which, includes, dom, garcie, de, navarre, l, cole, des, maris, and, l, cole, des, femmes, in, 1660, the, petit, bourbon, was, demolished, to, make, way, for, the, eastern, expansion, of, the, louvre, but, moli, re, s, company, was, allowed, to, move, into, the, abandoned, theatre, in, the, east, wing, of, the, palais, royal, after, a, period, of, refurbishment, they, opened, there, on, 20, january, 1661, in, order, to, please, his, patron, monsieur, who, was, so, enthralled, with, entertainment, and, art, that, he, was, soon, excluded, from, state, affairs, moli, re, wrote, and, played, dom, garcie, de, navarre, ou, le, prince, jaloux, the, jealous, prince, 4, february, 1661, a, heroic, comedy, derived, from, a, work, of, cicognini, two, other, comedies, of, the, same, year, were, the, successful, l, cole, des, maris, the, school, for, husbands, and, les, f, cheux, the, bores, subtitled, com, die, faite, pour, les, divertissements, du, roi, a, comedy, for, the, king, s, amusements, because, it, was, performed, during, a, series, of, parties, that, nicolas, fouquet, gave, in, honor, of, the, sovereign, these, entertainments, led, jean, baptiste, colbert, to, demand, the, arrest, of, fouquet, for, wasting, public, money, and, he, was, condemned, to, life, imprisonment, on, 20, february, 1662, moli, re, married, armande, b, jart, whom, he, believed, to, be, the, sister, of, madeleine, she, may, have, been, her, illegitimate, daughter, with, the, duke, of, modena, the, same, year, he, premiered, l, cole, des, femmes, the, school, for, wives, subsequently, regarded, as, a, masterpiece, it, poked, fun, at, the, limited, education, that, was, given, to, daughters, of, rich, families, and, reflected, moli, re, s, own, marriage, both, this, work, and, his, marriage, attracted, much, criticism, the, play, sparked, the, protest, called, the, quarrel, of, l, cole, des, femmes, on, the, artistic, side, he, responded, with, two, lesser, known, works, la, critique, de, l, cole, des, femmes, in, which, he, imagined, the, spectators, of, his, previous, work, attending, it, the, piece, mocks, the, people, who, had, criticised, l, cole, des, femmes, by, showing, them, at, dinner, after, watching, the, play, it, addresses, all, the, criticism, raised, about, the, piece, by, presenting, the, critics, arguments, and, then, dismissing, them, this, was, the, so, called, guerre, comique, war, of, comedy, in, which, the, opposite, side, was, taken, by, writers, like, donneau, de, vis, edm, boursault, and, montfleury, however, more, serious, opposition, was, brewing, focusing, on, moli, re, s, politics, and, his, personal, life, a, so, called, parti, des, d, vots, arose, in, french, high, society, who, protested, against, moli, re, s, excessive, realism, and, irreverence, which, were, causing, some, embarrassment, these, people, accused, moli, re, of, having, married, his, daughter, the, prince, of, conti, once, moli, re, s, friend, joined, them, moli, re, had, other, enemies, too, among, them, the, jansenists, and, some, traditional, authors, however, the, king, expressed, support, for, the, moliere, granting, him, a, pension, and, agreeing, to, be, the, godfather, of, moli, re, s, first, son, boileau, also, supported, him, through, statements, that, he, included, in, his, art, po, tique, moli, re, s, friendship, with, jean, baptiste, lully, influenced, him, towards, writing, his, le, mariage, forc, and, la, princesse, d, lide, subtitled, as, com, die, galante, m, l, e, de, musique, et, d, entr, es, de, ballet, written, for, royal, divertissements, at, the, palace, of, versailles, tartuffe, ou, l, imposteur, was, also, performed, at, versailles, in, 1664, and, created, the, greatest, scandal, of, moli, re, s, artistic, career, its, depiction, of, the, hypocrisy, of, the, dominant, classes, was, taken, as, an, outrage, and, violently, contested, it, also, aroused, the, wrath, of, the, jansenists, and, the, play, was, banned, moli, re, was, always, careful, not, to, attack, the, institution, of, monarchy, he, earned, a, position, as, one, of, the, king, s, favourites, and, enjoyed, his, protection, from, the, attacks, of, the, court, the, king, allegedly, suggested, that, moli, re, suspend, performances, of, tartuffe, and, the, author, rapidly, wrote, dom, juan, ou, le, festin, de, pierre, to, replace, it, it, was, a, strange, work, derived, from, a, work, by, tirso, de, molina, and, rendered, in, a, prose, that, still, seems, modern, today, it, describes, the, story, of, an, atheist, who, becomes, a, religious, hypocrite, and, for, this, is, punished, by, god, this, work, too, was, quickly, suspended, the, king, demonstrating, his, protection, once, again, became, the, new, official, sponsor, of, moli, re, s, troupe, with, music, by, lully, moli, re, presented, l, amour, m, decin, love, doctor, or, medical, love, subtitles, on, this, occasion, reported, that, the, work, was, given, par, ordre, du, roi, by, order, of, the, king, and, this, work, was, received, much, more, warmly, than, its, predecessors, in, 1666, le, misanthrope, was, produced, it, is, now, widely, regarded, as, moli, re, s, most, refined, masterpiece, the, one, with, the, highest, moral, content, but, it, was, little, appreciated, at, the, time, it, caused, the, conversion, of, donneau, de, vis, who, became, fond, of, his, theatre, but, it, was, a, commercial, flop, forcing, moli, re, to, immediately, write, le, m, decin, malgr, lui, the, doctor, despite, himself, a, satire, against, the, official, sciences, this, was, a, success, despite, a, moral, treatise, by, the, prince, of, conti, criticizing, the, theatre, in, general, and, moli, re, in, particular, in, several, of, his, plays, moli, re, depicted, the, physicians, of, his, day, as, pompous, individuals, who, speak, poor, latin, to, impress, others, with, false, erudition, and, know, only, clysters, and, bleedings, as, ineffective, remedies, after, the, m, licerte, and, the, pastorale, comique, he, tried, again, to, perform, a, revised, tartuffe, in, 1667, this, time, with, the, name, of, panulphe, or, l, imposteur, as, soon, as, the, king, left, paris, for, a, tour, lamoignon, and, the, archbishop, banned, the, play, the, king, finally, imposed, respect, for, tartuffe, a, few, years, later, after, he, had, gained, more, power, over, the, clergy, moli, re, now, ill, wrote, less, le, sicilien, ou, l, amour, peintre, was, written, for, festivities, at, the, castle, of, saint, germain, en, laye, and, was, followed, in, 1668, by, amphitryon, inspired, both, by, plautus, work, of, the, same, name, and, jean, rotrou, s, successful, reconfiguration, of, the, drama, with, some, conjecture, moli, re, s, play, can, be, seen, to, allude, to, the, love, affairs, of, louis, xiv, then, king, of, france, george, dandin, ou, le, mari, confondu, the, confounded, husband, was, little, appreciated, but, success, returned, with, l, avare, the, miser, now, very, well, known, with, lully, he, again, used, music, for, monsieur, de, pourceaugnac, for, les, amants, magnifiques, and, finally, for, le, bourgeois, gentilhomme, the, middle, class, gentleman, another, of, his, masterpieces, it, is, claimed, to, be, particularly, directed, against, colbert, the, minister, who, had, condemned, his, old, patron, fouquet, the, collaboration, with, lully, ended, with, a, trag, die, et, ballet, psych, written, in, collaboration, with, pierre, corneille, and, philippe, quinault, in, 1672, madeleine, b, jart, died, and, moli, re, suffered, from, this, loss, and, from, the, worsening, of, his, own, illness, nevertheless, he, wrote, a, successful, les, fourberies, de, scapin, scapin, s, deceits, a, farce, and, a, comedy, in, five, acts, his, following, play, la, comtesse, d, escarbagnas, is, considered, one, of, his, lesser, works, les, femmes, savantes, the, learned, ladies, of, 1672, is, considered, another, of, moli, re, s, masterpieces, it, was, born, from, the, termination, of, the, legal, use, of, music, in, theatre, since, lully, had, patented, the, opera, in, france, and, taken, most, of, the, best, available, singers, for, his, own, performances, so, moli, re, had, to, go, back, to, his, traditional, genre, it, was, a, great, success, and, it, led, to, his, last, work, which, is, still, held, in, high, esteem, in, his, 14, years, in, paris, moli, re, single, handedly, wrote, 31, of, the, 85, plays, performed, on, his, stage, in, 1661, moli, re, introduced, the, com, dies, ballets, in, conjunction, with, les, f, cheux, these, ballets, were, a, transitional, form, of, dance, performance, between, the, court, ballets, of, louis, xiv, and, the, art, of, professional, theatre, which, was, developing, in, the, advent, of, the, use, of, the, proscenium, stage, the, com, dies, ballets, developed, accidentally, when, moli, re, was, enlisted, to, mount, both, a, play, and, a, ballet, in, the, honor, of, louis, xiv, and, found, that, he, did, not, have, a, big, enough, cast, to, meet, these, demands, moli, re, therefore, decided, to, combine, the, ballet, and, the, play, so, that, his, goal, could, be, met, while, the, performers, catch, their, breath, and, change, costume, the, risky, move, paid, off, and, moli, re, was, asked, to, produce, twelve, more, com, dies, ballets, before, his, death, during, the, com, dies, ballets, moli, re, collaborated, with, pierre, beauchamp, who, codified, the, five, balletic, positions, of, the, feet, and, arms, and, was, partly, responsible, for, the, creation, of, the, beauchamp, feuillet, dance, notation, moli, re, also, collaborated, with, jean, baptiste, lully, lully, was, a, dancer, choreographer, and, composer, whose, dominant, reign, at, the, paris, op, ra, lasted, 15, years, under, his, command, ballet, and, opera, rightly, became, professional, arts, unto, themselves, the, com, dies, ballets, closely, integrated, dance, with, music, and, the, action, of, the, play, and, the, style, of, continuity, distinctly, separated, these, performances, from, the, court, ballets, of, the, time, additionally, the, com, dies, ballets, demanded, that, both, the, dancers, and, the, actors, play, an, important, role, in, advancing, the, story, similar, to, the, court, ballets, both, professionally, trained, dancers, and, courtiers, socialized, together, at, the, com, dies, ballets, louis, xiv, even, played, the, part, of, an, egyptian, in, moli, re, s, le, mariage, forc, 1664, and, also, appeared, as, neptune, and, apollo, in, his, retirement, performance, of, les, amants, magnifiques, 1670, moli, re, suffered, from, pulmonary, tuberculosis, possibly, contracted, when, he, was, imprisoned, for, debt, as, a, young, man, the, circumstances, of, moli, re, s, death, on, 17, february, 1673, became, legend, he, collapsed, on, stage, in, a, fit, of, coughing, and, haemorrhaging, while, performing, in, the, last, play, he, had, written, which, had, lavish, ballets, performed, to, the, music, of, marc, antoine, charpentier, and, which, ironically, was, titled, le, malade, imaginaire, the, imaginary, invalid, moli, re, insisted, on, completing, his, performance, afterwards, he, collapsed, again, with, another, larger, haemorrhage, before, being, taken, home, where, he, died, a, few, hours, later, without, receiving, the, last, rites, because, two, priests, refused, to, visit, him, while, a, third, arrived, too, late, the, superstition, that, green, brings, bad, luck, to, actors, is, said, to, originate, from, the, colour, of, the, clothing, he, was, wearing, at, the, time, of, his, death, under, french, law, at, the, time, actors, were, not, allowed, to, be, buried, in, the, sacred, ground, of, a, cemetery, however, moli, re, s, widow, armande, asked, the, king, if, her, spouse, could, be, granted, a, normal, funeral, at, night, the, king, agreed, and, moli, re, s, body,
