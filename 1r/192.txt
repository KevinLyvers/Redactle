from, across, the, channel, instilled, in, him, the, love, of, and, competence, in, the, english, language, the, proctor, caught, him, reading, a, book, by, rimbaud, or, mallarm, and, reprimanded, him, let, s, have, no, disorder, in, your, studies, cartier, bresson, said, he, used, the, informal, tu, which, usually, meant, you, were, about, to, get, a, good, thrashing, but, he, went, on, you, re, going, to, read, in, my, office, well, that, wasn, t, an, offer, he, had, to, repeat, he, studied, painting, when, he, was, just, 5, years, old, taking, an, apprenticeship, in, his, uncle, louis,

to, paris, galleries, to, study, contemporary, art, cartier, bresson, s, interest, in, modern, art, was, combined, with, an, admiration, for, the, works, of, the, renaissance, masters, jan, van, eyck, paolo, uccello, masaccio, piero, della, francesca, cartier, bresson, regarded, lhote, as, his, teacher, of, photography, without, a, camera, although, cartier, bresson, became, frustrated, with, lhote, s, rule, laden, approach, to, art, the, rigorous, theoretical, training, later, helped, him, identify, and, resolve, problems, of, artistic, form, and, composition, in, photography, in, the, 1920s, schools, of, photographic, realism, were, popping, up, throughout, europe, but, each, had, a, different, view, on, the, direction, photography, should, take, the, surrealist, movement, founded, in, 1924, was, a, catalyst, for, this, paradigm, shift, cartier, bresson, began, socializing, with, the, surrealists, at, the, caf, cyrano, in, the, place, blanche, he, met, a, number, of, the, movement, s, leading, protagonists, and, was, drawn, to, the, surrealist, movement, s, technique, of, using, the, subconscious, and, the, immediate, to, influence, their, work, the, historian, peter, galassi, explains, the, surrealists, approached, photography, in, the, same, way, that, aragon, and, breton, approached, the, street, with, a, voracious, appetite, for, the, usual, and, unusual, the, surrealists, recognized, in, plain, photographic, fact, an, essential, quality, that, had, been, excluded, from, prior, theories, of, photographic, realism, they, saw, that, ordinary, photographs, especially, when, uprooted, from, their, practical, functions, contain, a, wealth, of, unintended, unpredictable, meanings, cartier, bresson, matured, artistically, in, this, stormy, cultural, and, political, atmosphere, but, although, he, knew, the, concepts, he, couldn, t, express, them, dissatisfied, with, his, experiments, he, destroyed, most, of, his, early, paintings, from, 1928, to, 1929, cartier, bresson, studied, art, literature, and, english, at, the, university, of, cambridge, where, he, became, bilingual, in, 1930, he, was, conscripted, into, the, french, army, and, stationed, at, le, bourget, near, paris, a, time, about, which, he, later, remarked, and, i, had, quite, a, hard, time, of, it, too, because, i, was, toting, joyce, under, my, arm, and, a, lebel, rifle, on, my, shoulder, in, 1929, cartier, bresson, s, air, squadron, commandant, placed, him, under, house, arrest, for, hunting, without, a, licence, cartier, bresson, met, american, expatriate, harry, crosby, at, le, bourget, who, persuaded, the, commandant, to, release, cartier, bresson, into, his, custody, for, a, few, days, the, two, men, both, had, an, interest, in, photography, and, harry, presented, henri, with, his, first, camera, they, spent, their, time, together, taking, and, printing, pictures, at, crosby, s, home, le, moulin, du, soleil, the, sun, mill, near, paris, in, ermenonville, france, 163, crosby, later, said, cartier, bresson, looked, like, a, fledgling, shy, and, frail, and, mild, as, whey, embracing, the, open, sexuality, offered, by, crosby, and, his, wife, caresse, cartier, bresson, fell, into, an, intense, sexual, relationship, with, her, that, lasted, until, 1931, two, years, after, harry, crosby, died, by, suicide, cartier, bresson, s, affair, with, caresse, crosby, ended, in, 1931, leaving, him, broken, hearted, during, conscription, he, read, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, this, gave, him, the, idea, of, escaping, and, finding, adventure, on, the, c, te, d, ivoire, in, french, colonial, africa, he, survived, by, shooting, game, and, selling, it, to, local, villagers, from, hunting, he, learned, methods, which, he, later, used, in, photography, on, the, c, te, d, ivoire, he, contracted, blackwater, fever, which, nearly, killed, him, while, still, feverish, he, sent, instructions, to, his, grandfather, for, his, own, funeral, asking, to, be, buried, in, normandy, at, the, edge, of, the, eawy, forest, while, debussy, s, string, quartet, was, played, although, cartier, bresson, took, a, portable, camera, smaller, than, a, brownie, box, to, c, te, d, ivoire, only, seven, photographs, survived, the, tropics, returning, to, france, cartier, bresson, recuperated, in, marseille, in, late, 1931, and, deepened, his, relationship, with, the, surrealists, he, became, inspired, by, a, 1930, photograph, by, hungarian, photojournalist, martin, munkacsi, showing, three, naked, young, african, boys, caught, in, near, silhouette, running, into, the, surf, of, lake, tanganyika, titled, three, boys, at, lake, tanganyika, this, captured, the, freedom, grace, and, spontaneity, of, their, movement, and, their, joy, at, being, alive, that, photograph, inspired, him, to, stop, painting, and, to, take, up, photography, seriously, he, explained, i, suddenly, understood, that, a, photograph, could, fix, eternity, in, an, instant, he, acquired, the, leica, camera, with, 50, mm, lens, in, marseilles, that, would, accompany, him, for, many, years, the, anonymity, that, the, small, camera, gave, him, in, a, crowd, or, during, an, intimate, moment, was, essential, in, overcoming, the, formal, and, unnatural, behavior, of, those, who, were, aware, of, being, photographed, he, enhanced, his, anonymity, by, painting, all, shiny, parts, of, the, leica, with, black, paint, the, leica, opened, up, new, possibilities, in, photography, the, ability, to, capture, the, world, in, its, actual, state, of, movement, and,

many, of, his, most, renowned, photographs, such, as, behind, the, gare, saint, lazare, are, of, seemingly, unimportant, moments, of, ordinary, daily, life, cartier, bresson, did, not, like, to, be,

of, his, face, to, avoid, being, photographed, in, a, charlie, rose, interview, in, 2000, cartier, bresson, noted, that, it, wasn, t, necessarily, that, he, hated, to, be, photographed, but, it, was, that, he, was, embarrassed, by, the, notion, of, being, photographed, for, being, famous, cartier, bresson, believed, that, what, went, on, beneath, the, surface, was, nobody, s, business, but, his, own, he, did, recall, that, he, once, confided, his, innermost, secrets, to, a, paris, taxi, driver, certain, that, he, would, never, meet, the, man, again, in, 2003, he, created, the, henri, cartier, bresson, foundation, in, paris, with, his, wife, the, belgian, photographer, martine, franck, and, his, daughter, to, preserve, and, share, his, legacy, in, 2018, the, foundation, relocated, from, the, montparnasse, district, to, le, marais, the, highest, price, reached, by, one, of, his, photographs, was, when, behind, the, gare, saint, lazare, sold, at, christie, s, on, 17, november, 2011, by, 590, 455, cartier, bresson, s, photographs, were, also, influential, in, the, development, of, cin, ma, v, rit, film, in, particular, he, is, credited, as, the, inspiration, for, the, national, film, board, of, canada, s, early, work, in, this, genre, with, its, 1958, candid, eye, series, cartier, bresson, almost, always, used, a, leica, 35, mm, rangefinder, camera, fitted, with, a, normal, 50, mm, lens, or, occasionally, a, wide, angle, lens, for, landscapes, he, often, wrapped, black, tape, around, the, camera, s, chrome, body, to, make, it, less, conspicuous, with, fast, black, and, white, film, and, sharp, lenses, he, was, able, to, photograph, events, unnoticed, no, longer, bound, by, a, 4, 5, press, camera, or, a, medium, format, twin, lens, reflex, camera, miniature, format, cameras, gave, cartier, bresson, what, he, called, the, velvet, hand, the, hawk, s, eye, he, never, photographed, with, flash, a, practice, he, saw, as, impolite, like, coming, to, a, concert, with, a, pistol, in, your, hand, he, believed, in, composing, his, photographs, in, the, viewfinder, not, in, the, darkroom, he, showcased, this, belief, by, having, nearly, all, his, photographs, printed, only, at, full, frame, and, completely, free, of, any, cropping, or, other, darkroom, manipulation, he, insisted, that, his, prints, be, left, uncropped, so, as, to, include, a, few, millimeters, of, the, unexposed, negative, around, the, image, area, resulting, in, a, black, frame, around, the, developed, picture, cartier, bresson, worked, exclusively, in, black, and, white, other, than, a, few, experiments, in, color, he, disliked, developing, or, making, his, own, prints, and, showed, a, considerable, lack, of, interest, in, the, process, of, photography, in, general, likening, photography, with, the, small, camera, to, an, instant, drawing, technical, aspects, of, photography, were, valid, for, him, only, where, they, allowed, him, to, express, what, he, saw, constant, new, discoveries,
