louis, hector, berlioz, 11, december, 1803, 8, march, 1869, was, a, french, romantic, composer, and, conductor, his, output, includes, orchestral, works, such, as, the, symphonie, fantastique, and, harold, in, italy, choral, pieces, including, the, requiem, and, l, enfance, du, christ, his, three, operas, benvenuto, cellini, les, troyens, and, b, atrice, et, b, n, dict, and, works, of, hybrid, genres, such, as, the, dramatic, symphony, rom, o, et, juliette, and, the, dramatic, legend, la, damnation, de, faust, the, elder, son, of, a, provincial, physician, berlioz, was, expected, to, follow, his, father, into, medicine, and, he, attended, a, parisian, medical, college, before, defying, his, family, by, taking, up, music, as, a, profession, his, independence, of, mind, and, refusal, to, follow, traditional, rules, and, formulas, put, him, at, odds, with, the, conservative, musical, establishment, of, paris, he, briefly, moderated, his, style, sufficiently, to, win, france, s, premier, music, prize, the, prix, de, rome, in, 1830, but, he, learned, little, from, the, academics, of, the, paris, conservatoire, opinion, was, divided, for, many, years, between, those, who, thought, him, an, original, genius, and, those, who, viewed, his, music, as, lacking, in, form, and, coherence, at, the, age, of, twenty, four, berlioz, fell, in, love, with, the, irish, shakespearean, actress, harriet, smithson, and, he, pursued, her, obsessively, until, she, finally, accepted, him, seven, years, later, their, marriage, was, happy, at, first, but, eventually, foundered, harriet, inspired, his, first, major, success, the, symphonie, fantastique, in, which, an, idealised, depiction, of, her, occurs, throughout, berlioz, completed, three, operas, the, first, of, which, benvenuto, cellini, was, an, outright, failure, the, second, the, epic, les, troyens, the, trojans, was, so, large, in, scale, that, it, was, never, staged, in, its, entirety, during, his, lifetime, his, last, opera, b, atrice, et, b, n, dict, based, on, shakespeare, s, comedy, much, ado, about, nothing, was, a, success, at, its, premiere, but, did, not, enter, the, regular, operatic, repertoire, meeting, only, occasional, success, in, france, as, a, composer, berlioz, increasingly, turned, to, conducting, in, which, he, gained, an, international, reputation, he, was, highly, regarded, in, germany, britain, and, russia, both, as, a, composer, and, as, a, conductor, to, supplement, his, earnings, he, wrote, musical, journalism, throughout, much, of, his, career, some, of, it, has, been, preserved, in, book, form, including, his, treatise, on, instrumentation, 1844, which, was, influential, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, berlioz, died, in, paris, at, the, age, of, 65, berlioz, was, born, on, 11, december, 1803, the, eldest, child, of, louis, berlioz, 1776, 1848, a, physician, and, his, wife, marie, antoinette, jos, phine, n, e, marmion, 1784, 1838, his, birthplace, was, the, family, home, in, the, commune, of, la, c, te, saint, andr, in, the, d, partement, of, is, re, in, south, eastern, france, his, parents, had, five, more, children, three, of, whom, died, in, infancy, their, surviving, daughters, nanci, and, ad, le, remained, close, to, berlioz, throughout, their, lives, berlioz, s, father, a, respected, local, figure, was, a, progressively, minded, doctor, credited, as, the, first, european, to, practise, and, write, about, acupuncture, he, was, an, agnostic, with, a, liberal, outlook, his, wife, was, a, strict, roman, catholic, of, less, flexible, views, after, briefly, attending, a, local, school, when, he, was, about, ten, berlioz, was, educated, at, home, by, his, father, he, recalled, in, his, m, moires, that, he, enjoyed, geography, especially, books, about, travel, to, which, his, mind, would, sometimes, wander, when, he, was, supposed, to, be, studying, latin, the, classics, nonetheless, made, an, impression, on, him, and, he, was, moved, to, tears, by, virgil, s, account, of, the, tragedy, of, dido, and, aeneas, later, he, studied, philosophy, rhetoric, and, because, his, father, planned, a, medical, career, for, him, anatomy, music, did, not, feature, prominently, in, the, young, berlioz, s, education, his, father, gave, him, basic, instruction, on, the, flageolet, and, he, later, took, flute, and, guitar, lessons, with, local, teachers, he, never, studied, the, piano, and, throughout, his, life, played, haltingly, at, best, he, later, contended, that, this, was, an, advantage, because, it, saved, me, from, the, tyranny, of, keyboard, habits, so, dangerous, to, thought, and, from, the, lure, of, conventional, harmonies, at, the, age, of, twelve, berlioz, fell, in, love, for, the, first, time, the, object, of, his, affections, was, an, eighteen, year, old, neighbour, estelle, dub, uf, he, was, teased, for, what, was, seen, as, a, boyish, infatuation, but, something, of, his, early, passion, for, estelle, endured, all, his, life, he, poured, some, of, his, unrequited, feelings, into, his, early, attempts, at, composition, trying, to, master, harmony, he, read, rameau, s, trait, de, l, harmonie, which, proved, incomprehensible, to, a, novice, but, charles, simon, catel, s, simpler, treatise, on, the, subject, made, it, clearer, to, him, he, wrote, several, chamber, works, as, a, youth, subsequently, destroying, the, manuscripts, but, one, theme, that, remained, in, his, mind, reappeared, later, as, the, a, flat, second, subject, of, the, overture, to, les, francs, juges, in, march, 1821, berlioz, passed, the, baccalaur, at, examination, at, the, university, of, grenoble, it, is, not, certain, whether, at, the, first, or, second, attempt, and, in, late, september, aged, seventeen, he, moved, to, paris, at, his, father, s, insistence, he, enrolled, at, the, school, of, medicine, of, the, university, of, paris, he, had, to, fight, hard, to, overcome, his, revulsion, at, dissecting, bodies, but, in, deference, to, his, father, s, wishes, he, forced, himself, to, continue, his, medical, studies, the, horrors, of, the, medical, college, were, mitigated, thanks, to, an, ample, allowance, from, his, father, which, enabled, him, to, take, full, advantage, of, the, cultural, and, particularly, musical, life, of, paris, music, did, not, at, that, time, enjoy, the, prestige, of, literature, in, french, culture, but, paris, nonetheless, possessed, two, major, opera, houses, and, the, country, s, most, important, music, library, berlioz, took, advantage, of, them, all, within, days, of, arriving, in, paris, he, went, to, the, op, ra, and, although, the, piece, on, offer, was, by, a, minor, composer, the, staging, and, the, magnificent, orchestral, playing, enchanted, him, he, went, to, other, works, at, the, op, ra, and, the, op, ra, comique, at, the, former, three, weeks, after, his, arrival, he, saw, gluck, s, iphig, nie, en, tauride, which, thrilled, him, he, was, particularly, inspired, by, gluck, s, use, of, the, orchestra, to, carry, the, drama, along, a, later, performance, of, the, same, work, at, the, op, ra, convinced, him, that, his, vocation, was, to, be, a, composer, the, dominance, of, italian, opera, in, paris, against, which, berlioz, later, campaigned, was, still, in, the, future, and, at, the, opera, houses, he, heard, and, absorbed, the, works, of, tienne, m, hul, and, fran, ois, adrien, boieldieu, other, operas, written, in, the, french, style, by, foreign, composers, particularly, gaspare, spontini, and, above, all, five, operas, by, gluck, he, began, to, visit, the, paris, conservatoire, library, in, between, his, medical, studies, seeking, out, scores, of, gluck, s, operas, and, making, copies, of, parts, of, them, by, the, end, of, 1822, he, felt, that, his, attempts, to, learn, composition, needed, to, be, augmented, with, formal, tuition, and, he, approached, jean, fran, ois, le, sueur, director, of, the, royal, chapel, and, professor, at, the, conservatoire, who, accepted, him, as, a, private, pupil, in, august, 1823, berlioz, made, the, first, of, many, contributions, to, the, musical, press, a, letter, to, the, journal, le, corsaire, defending, french, opera, against, the, incursions, of, its, italian, rival, he, contended, that, all, rossini, s, operas, put, together, could, not, stand, comparison, with, even, a, few, bars, of, those, of, gluck, spontini, or, le, sueur, by, now, he, had, composed, several, works, including, estelle, et, n, morin, and, le, passage, de, la, mer, rouge, the, crossing, of, the, red, sea, both, since, lost, in, 1824, berlioz, graduated, from, medical, school, after, which, he, abandoned, medicine, to, the, strong, disapproval, of, his, parents, his, father, suggested, law, as, an, alternative, profession, and, refused, to, countenance, music, as, a, career, he, reduced, and, sometimes, withheld, his, son, s, allowance, and, berlioz, went, through, some, years, of, financial, hardship, in, 1824, berlioz, composed, a, messe, solennelle, it, was, performed, twice, after, which, he, suppressed, the, score, which, was, thought, lost, until, a, copy, was, discovered, in, 1991, during, 1825, and, 1826, he, wrote, his, first, opera, les, francs, juges, which, was, not, performed, and, survives, only, in, fragments, the, best, known, of, which, is, the, overture, in, later, works, he, reused, parts, of, the, score, such, as, the, march, of, the, guards, which, he, incorporated, four, years, later, in, the, symphonie, fantastique, as, the, march, to, the, scaffold, in, august, 1826, berlioz, was, admitted, as, a, student, to, the, conservatoire, studying, composition, under, le, sueur, and, counterpoint, and, fugue, with, anton, reicha, in, the, same, year, he, made, the, first, of, four, attempts, to, win, france, s, premier, music, prize, the, prix, de, rome, and, was, eliminated, in, the, first, round, the, following, year, to, earn, some, money, he, joined, the, chorus, at, the, th, tre, des, nouveaut, s, he, competed, again, for, the, prix, de, rome, submitting, the, first, of, his, prix, cantatas, la, mort, d, orph, e, in, july, later, that, year, he, attended, productions, of, shakespeare, s, hamlet, and, romeo, and, juliet, at, the, th, tre, de, l, od, on, given, by, charles, kemble, s, touring, company, although, at, the, time, berlioz, spoke, hardly, any, english, he, was, overwhelmed, by, the, plays, the, start, of, a, lifelong, passion, for, shakespeare, he, also, conceived, a, passion, for, kemble, s, leading, lady, harriet, smithson, his, biographer, hugh, macdonald, calls, it, emotional, derangement, and, obsessively, pursued, her, without, success, for, several, years, she, refused, even, to, meet, him, the, first, concert, of, berlioz, s, music, took, place, in, may, 1828, when, his, friend, nathan, bloc, conducted, the, premieres, of, the, overtures, les, francs, juges, and, waverley, and, other, works, the, hall, was, far, from, full, and, berlioz, lost, money, nevertheless, he, was, greatly, encouraged, by, the, vociferous, approval, of, his, performers, and, the, applause, from, musicians, in, the, audience, including, his, conservatoire, professors, the, directors, of, the, op, ra, and, op, ra, comique, and, the, composers, auber, and, h, rold, berlioz, s, fascination, with, shakespeare, s, plays, prompted, him, to, start, learning, english, during, 1828, so, that, he, could, read, them, in, the, original, at, around, the, same, time, he, encountered, two, further, creative, inspirations, beethoven, and, goethe, he, heard, beethoven, s, third, fifth, and, seventh, symphonies, performed, at, the, conservatoire, and, read, goethe, s, faust, in, g, rard, de, nerval, s, translation, beethoven, became, both, an, ideal, and, an, obstacle, for, berlioz, an, inspiring, predecessor, but, a, daunting, one, goethe, s, work, was, the, basis, of, huit, sc, nes, de, faust, berlioz, s, opus, 1, which, premiered, the, following, year, and, was, reworked, and, expanded, much, later, as, la, damnation, de, faust, berlioz, was, largely, apolitical, and, neither, supported, nor, opposed, the, july, revolution, of, 1830, but, when, it, broke, out, he, found, himself, in, the, middle, of, it, he, recorded, events, in, his, m, moires, i, was, finishing, my, cantata, when, the, revolution, broke, out, i, dashed, off, the, final, pages, of, my, orchestral, score, to, the, sound, of, stray, bullets, coming, over, the, roofs, and, pattering, on, the, wall, outside, my, window, on, the, 29th, i, had, finished, and, was, free, to, go, out, and, roam, about, paris, till, morning, pistol, in, hand, the, cantata, was, la, mort, de, sardanapale, with, which, he, won, the, prix, de, rome, his, entry, the, previous, year, cl, op, tre, had, attracted, disapproval, from, the, judges, because, to, highly, conservative, musicians, it, betrayed, dangerous, tendencies, and, for, his, 1830, offering, he, carefully, modified, his, natural, style, to, meet, official, approval, during, the, same, year, he, wrote, the, symphonie, fantastique, and, became, engaged, to, be, married, by, now, recoiling, from, his, obsession, with, smithson, berlioz, fell, in, love, with, a, nineteen, year, old, pianist, marie, camille, moke, his, feelings, were, reciprocated, and, the, couple, planned, to, be, married, in, december, berlioz, organised, a, concert, at, which, the, symphonie, fantastique, was, premiered, protracted, applause, followed, the, performance, and, the, press, reviews, expressed, both, the, shock, and, the, pleasure, the, work, had, given, berlioz, s, biographer, david, cairns, calls, the, concert, a, landmark, not, only, in, the, composer, s, career, but, in, the, evolution, of, the, modern, orchestra, franz, liszt, was, among, those, attending, the, concert, this, was, the, beginning, of, a, long, friendship, liszt, later, transcribed, the, entire, symphonie, fantastique, for, piano, to, enable, more, people, to, hear, it, shortly, after, the, concert, berlioz, set, off, for, italy, under, the, terms, of, the, prix, de, rome, winners, studied, for, two, years, at, the, villa, medici, the, french, academy, in, rome, within, three, weeks, of, his, arrival, he, went, absent, without, leave, he, had, learnt, that, marie, had, broken, off, their, engagement, and, was, to, marry, an, older, and, richer, suitor, camille, pleyel, the, heir, to, the, pleyel, piano, manufacturing, company, berlioz, made, an, elaborate, plan, to, kill, them, both, and, her, mother, known, to, him, as, l, hippopotame, and, acquired, poisons, pistols, and, a, disguise, for, the, purpose, by, the, time, he, reached, nice, on, his, journey, to, paris, he, thought, better, of, the, scheme, abandoned, the, idea, of, revenge, and, successfully, sought, permission, to, return, to, the, villa, medici, he, stayed, for, a, few, weeks, in, nice, and, wrote, his, king, lear, overture, on, the, way, back, to, rome, he, began, work, on, a, piece, for, narrator, solo, voices, chorus, and, orchestra, le, retour, la, vie, the, return, to, life, later, renamed, l, lio, a, sequel, to, the, symphonie, fantastique, berlioz, took, little, pleasure, in, his, time, in, rome, his, colleagues, at, the, villa, medici, under, their, benevolent, principal, horace, vernet, made, him, welcome, and, he, enjoyed, his, meetings, with, felix, mendelssohn, who, was, visiting, the, city, but, he, found, rome, distasteful, the, most, stupid, and, prosaic, city, i, know, it, is, no, place, for, anyone, with, head, or, heart, nonetheless, italy, had, an, important, influence, on, his, development, he, visited, many, parts, of, it, during, his, residency, in, rome, macdonald, comments, that, after, his, time, there, berlioz, had, a, new, colour, and, glow, in, his, music, sensuous, and, vivacious, derived, not, from, italian, painting, in, which, he, was, uninterested, or, italian, music, which, he, despised, but, from, the, scenery, and, the, sun, and, from, his, acute, sense, of, locale, macdonald, identifies, harold, in, italy, benvenuto, cellini, and, rom, o, et, juliette, as, the, most, obvious, expressions, of, his, response, to, italy, and, adds, that, les, troyens, and, b, atrice, et, b, n, dict, reflect, the, warmth, and, stillness, of, the, mediterranean, as, well, as, its, vivacity, and, force, berlioz, himself, wrote, that, harold, in, italy, drew, on, the, poetic, memories, formed, from, my, wanderings, in, abruzzi, vernet, agreed, to, berlioz, s, request, to, be, allowed, to, leave, the, villa, medici, before, the, end, of, his, two, year, term, heeding, vernet, s, advice, that, it, would, be, prudent, to, delay, his, return, to, paris, where, the, conservatoire, authorities, might, be, less, indulgent, about, his, premature, ending, of, his, studies, he, made, a, leisurely, journey, back, detouring, via, la, c, te, saint, andr, to, see, his, family, he, left, rome, in, may, 1832, and, arrived, in, paris, in, november, on, 9, december, 1832, berlioz, presented, a, concert, of, his, works, at, the, conservatoire, the, programme, included, the, overture, of, les, francs, juges, the, symphonie, fantastique, extensively, revised, since, its, premiere, and, le, retour, la, vie, in, which, bocage, a, popular, actor, declaimed, the, monologues, through, a, third, party, berlioz, had, sent, an, invitation, to, harriet, smithson, who, accepted, and, was, dazzled, by, the, celebrities, in, the, audience, among, the, musicians, present, were, liszt, fr, d, ric, chopin, and, niccol, paganini, writers, included, alexandre, dumas, th, ophile, gautier, heinrich, heine, victor, hugo, and, george, sand, the, concert, was, such, a, success, that, the, programme, was, repeated, within, the, month, but, the, more, immediate, consequence, was, that, berlioz, and, smithson, finally, met, by, 1832, smithson, s, career, was, in, decline, she, presented, a, ruinously, unsuccessful, season, first, at, the, th, tre, italien, and, then, at, lesser, venues, and, by, march, 1833, she, was, deep, in, debt, biographers, differ, about, whether, and, to, what, extent, smithson, s, receptiveness, to, berlioz, s, wooing, was, motivated, by, financial, considerations, but, she, accepted, him, and, in, the, face, of, strong, opposition, from, both, their, families, they, were, married, at, the, british, embassy, in, paris, on, 3, october, 1833, the, couple, lived, first, in, paris, and, later, in, montmartre, then, still, a, village, on, 14, august, 1834, their, only, child, louis, cl, ment, thomas, was, born, the, first, few, years, of, the, marriage, were, happy, although, it, eventually, foundered, harriet, continued, to, yearn, for, a, career, but, as, her, biographer, peter, raby, comments, she, never, learned, to, speak, french, fluently, which, seriously, limited, both, her, professional, and, her, social, life, paganini, known, chiefly, as, a, violinist, had, acquired, a, stradivarius, viola, which, he, wanted, to, play, in, public, if, he, could, find, the, right, music, greatly, impressed, by, the, symphonie, fantastique, he, asked, berlioz, to, write, him, a, suitable, piece, berlioz, told, him, that, he, could, not, write, a, brilliantly, virtuoso, work, and, began, composing, what, he, called, a, symphony, with, viola, obbligato, harold, in, italy, as, he, foresaw, paganini, found, the, solo, part, too, reticent, there, s, not, enough, for, me, to, do, here, i, should, be, playing, all, the, time, and, the, violist, at, the, premiere, in, november, 1834, was, chr, tien, urhan, until, the, end, of, 1835, berlioz, had, a, modest, stipend, as, a, laureate, of, the, prix, de, rome, his, earnings, from, composing, were, neither, substantial, nor, regular, and, he, supplemented, them, by, writing, music, criticism, for, the, parisian, press, macdonald, comments, that, this, was, activity, at, which, he, excelled, but, which, he, abhorred, he, wrote, for, l, europe, litt, raire, 1833, le, r, novateur, 1833, 1835, and, from, 1834, for, the, gazette, musicale, and, the, journal, des, d, bats, he, was, the, first, but, not, the, last, prominent, french, composer, to, double, as, a, reviewer, among, his, successors, were, faur, messager, dukas, and, debussy, although, he, complained, both, privately, and, sometimes, in, his, articles, that, his, time, would, be, better, spent, writing, music, than, in, writing, music, criticism, he, was, able, to, indulge, himself, in, attacking, his, b, tes, noires, and, extolling, his, enthusiasms, the, former, included, musical, pedants, coloratura, writing, and, singing, viola, players, who, were, merely, incompetent, violinists, inane, libretti, and, baroque, counterpoint, he, extravagantly, praised, beethoven, s, symphonies, and, gluck, s, and, weber, s, operas, and, scrupulously, refrained, from, promoting, his, own, compositions, his, journalism, consisted, mainly, of, music, criticism, some, of, which, he, collected, and, published, such, as, evenings, in, the, orchestra, 1854, but, also, more, technical, articles, such, as, those, that, formed, the, basis, of, his, treatise, on, instrumentation, 1844, despite, his, complaints, berlioz, continued, writing, music, criticism, for, most, of, his, life, long, after, he, had, any, financial, need, to, do, so, berlioz, secured, a, commission, from, the, french, government, for, his, requiem, the, grande, messe, des, morts, first, performed, at, les, invalides, in, december, 1837, a, second, government, commission, followed, the, grande, symphonie, fun, bre, et, triomphale, in, 1840, neither, work, brought, him, much, money, or, artistic, fame, at, the, time, but, the, requiem, held, a, special, place, in, his, affections, if, i, were, threatened, with, the, destruction, of, the, whole, of, my, works, save, one, i, would, crave, mercy, for, the, messe, des, morts, one, of, berlioz, s, main, aims, in, the, 1830s, was, battering, down, the, doors, of, the, op, ra, in, paris, at, this, period, the, musical, success, that, mattered, was, in, the, opera, house, and, not, the, concert, hall, robert, schumann, commented, to, the, french, music, by, itself, means, nothing, berlioz, worked, on, his, opera, benvenuto, cellini, from, 1834, until, 1837, continually, distracted, by, his, increasing, activities, as, a, critic, and, as, a, promoter, of, his, own, symphonic, concerts, the, berlioz, scholar, d, kern, holoman, comments, that, berlioz, rightly, regarded, benvenuto, cellini, as, a, work, of, exceptional, exuberance, and, verve, deserving, a, better, reception, than, it, received, holoman, adds, that, the, piece, was, of, surpassing, technical, difficulty, and, that, the, singers, were, not, especially, co, operative, a, weak, libretto, and, unsatisfactory, staging, exacerbated, the, poor, reception, the, opera, had, only, four, complete, performances, three, in, september, 1838, and, one, in, january, 1839, berlioz, said, that, the, failure, of, the, piece, meant, that, the, doors, of, the, op, ra, were, closed, to, him, for, the, rest, of, his, career, which, they, were, except, for, a, commission, to, arrange, a, weber, score, in, 1841, shortly, after, the, failure, of, the, opera, berlioz, had, a, great, success, as, composer, conductor, of, a, concert, at, which, harold, in, italy, was, given, again, this, time, paganini, was, present, in, the, audience, he, came, on, to, the, platform, at, the, end, and, knelt, in, homage, to, berlioz, and, kissed, his, hand, a, few, days, later, berlioz, was, astonished, to, receive, a, cheque, from, him, for, 20, 000, francs, paganini, s, gift, enabled, berlioz, to, pay, off, harriet, s, and, his, own, debts, give, up, music, criticism, for, the, time, being, and, concentrate, on, composition, he, wrote, the, dramatic, symphony, rom, o, et, juliette, for, voices, chorus, and, orchestra, it, was, premiered, in, november, 1839, and, was, so, well, received, that, berlioz, and, his, huge, instrumental, and, vocal, forces, gave, two, further, performances, in, rapid, succession, among, the, audiences, was, the, young, wagner, who, was, overwhelmed, by, its, revelation, of, the, possibilities, of, musical, poetry, and, who, later, drew, on, it, when, composing, tristan, und, isolde, at, the, close, of, the, decade, berlioz, achieved, official, recognition, in, the, form, of, appointment, as, deputy, librarian, of, the, conservatoire, and, as, an, officer, of, the, legion, of, honour, the, former, was, an, undemanding, post, but, not, highly, paid, and, berlioz, remained, in, need, of, a, reliable, income, to, allow, him, the, leisure, for, composition, the, symphonie, fun, bre, et, triomphale, marking, the, tenth, anniversary, of, the, 1830, revolution, was, performed, in, the, open, air, under, the, direction, of, the, composer, in, july, 1840, the, following, year, the, op, ra, commissioned, berlioz, to, adapt, weber, s, der, freisch, tz, to, meet, the, house, s, rigid, requirements, he, wrote, recitatives, to, replace, the, spoken, dialogue, and, orchestrated, weber, s, invitation, to, the, dance, to, provide, the, obligatory, ballet, music, in, the, same, year, he, completed, settings, of, six, poems, by, his, friend, th, ophile, gautier, which, formed, the, song, cycle, les, nuits, d, t, with, piano, accompaniment, later, orchestrated, he, also, worked, on, a, projected, opera, la, nonne, sanglante, the, bloody, nun, to, a, libretto, by, eug, ne, scribe, but, made, little, progress, in, november, 1841, he, began, publishing, a, series, of, sixteen, articles, in, the, revue, et, gazette, musicale, giving, his, views, about, orchestration, they, were, the, basis, of, his, treatise, on, instrumentation, published, in, 1843, during, the, 1840s, berlioz, spent, much, of, his, time, making, music, outside, france, he, struggled, to, make, money, from, his, concerts, in, paris, and, learning, of, the, large, sums, made, by, promoters, from, performances, of, his, music, in, other, countries, he, resolved, to, try, conducting, abroad, he, began, in, brussels, giving, two, concerts, in, september, 1842, an, extensive, german, tour, followed, in, 1842, and, 1843, he, gave, concerts, in, twelve, german, cities, his, reception, was, enthusiastic, the, german, public, was, better, disposed, than, the, french, to, his, innovative, compositions, and, his, conducting, was, seen, as, highly, impressive, during, the, tour, he, had, enjoyable, meetings, with, mendelssohn, and, schumann, in, leipzig, wagner, in, dresden, and, meyerbeer, in, berlin, by, this, time, berlioz, s, marriage, was, failing, harriet, resented, his, celebrity, and, her, own, eclipse, and, as, raby, puts, it, possessiveness, turned, to, suspicion, and, jealousy, as, berlioz, became, involved, with, the, singer, marie, recio, harriet, s, health, deteriorated, and, she, took, to, drinking, heavily, her, suspicion, about, recio, was, well, founded, the, latter, became, berlioz, s, mistress, in, 1841, and, accompanied, him, on, his, german, tour, berlioz, returned, to, paris, in, mid, 1843, during, the, following, year, he, wrote, two, of, his, most, popular, short, works, the, overtures, le, carnaval, romain, reusing, music, from, benvenuto, cellini, and, le, corsaire, originally, called, la, tour, de, nice, towards, the, end, of, the, year, he, and, harriet, separated, berlioz, maintained, two, households, harriet, remained, in, montmartre, and, he, moved, in, with, recio, at, her, flat, in, central, paris, his, son, louis, was, sent, to, a, boarding, school, in, rouen, foreign, tours, featured, prominently, in, berlioz, s, life, during, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, not, only, were, they, highly, rewarding, both, artistically, and, financially, but, he, did, not, have, to, grapple, with, the, administrative, problems, of, promoting, concerts, in, paris, macdonald, comments, the, more, he, travelled, the, more, bitter, he, became, about, conditions, at, home, yet, though, he, contemplated, settling, abroad, in, dresden, for, instance, and, in, london, he, always, went, back, to, paris, berlioz, s, major, work, from, the, decade, was, la, damnation, de, faust, he, presented, it, in, paris, in, december, 1846, but, it, played, to, half, empty, houses, despite, excellent, reviews, some, from, critics, not, usually, well, disposed, to, his, music, the, highly, romantic, subject, was, out, of, step, with, the, times, and, one, sympathetic, reviewer, observed, that, there, was, an, unbridgeable, gap, between, the, composer, s, conception, of, art, and, that, of, the, paris, public, the, failure, of, the, piece, left, berlioz, heavily, in, debt, he, restored, his, finances, the, following, year, with, the, first, of, two, highly, remunerative, trips, to, russia, his, other, foreign, tours, during, the, rest, of, the, 1840s, included, austria, hungary, bohemia, and, germany, after, those, came, the, first, of, his, five, visits, to, england, it, lasted, for, more, than, seven, months, november, 1847, to, july, 1848, his, reception, in, london, was, enthusiastic, but, the, visit, was, not, a, financial, success, because, of, mismanagement, by, his, impresario, the, conductor, louis, antoine, jullien, soon, after, berlioz, s, return, to, paris, in, mid, september, 1848, harriet, suffered, a, series, of, strokes, which, left, her, almost, paralysed, she, needed, constant, nursing, which, he, paid, for, when, in, paris, he, visited, her, continually, sometimes, twice, a, day, after, the, failure, of, la, damnation, de, faust, berlioz, spent, less, time, on, composition, during, the, next, eight, years, he, wrote, a, te, deum, completed, in, 1849, but, not, published, until, 1855, and, some, short, pieces, his, most, substantial, work, between, the, damnation, and, his, epic, les, troyens, 1856, 1858, was, a, sacred, trilogy, l, enfance, du, christ, christ, s, childhood, which, he, began, in, 1850, in, 1851, he, was, at, the, great, exhibition, in, london, as, a, member, of, an, international, committee, judging, musical, instruments, he, returned, to, london, in, 1852, and, 1853, conducting, his, own, works, and, others, he, enjoyed, consistent, success, there, with, the, exception, of, a, revival, of, benvenuto, cellini, at, covent, garden, which, was, withdrawn, after, one, performance, the, opera, was, presented, in, leipzig, in, 1852, in, a, revised, version, prepared, by, liszt, with, berlioz, s, approval, and, was, moderately, successful, in, the, early, years, of, the, decade, berlioz, made, numerous, appearances, in, germany, as, a, conductor, in, 1854, harriet, died, both, berlioz, and, their, son, louis, had, been, with, her, shortly, before, her, death, during, the, year, berlioz, completed, the, composition, of, l, enfance, du, christ, worked, on, his, book, of, memoirs, and, married, marie, recio, which, he, explained, to, his, son, he, felt, it, his, duty, to, do, after, living, with, her, for, so, many, years, at, the, end, of, the, year, the, first, performance, of, l, enfance, du, christ, was, warmly, received, to, his, surprise, he, spent, much, of, the, next, year, in, conducting, and, writing, prose, during, berlioz, s, german, tour, in, 1856, liszt, and, his, companion, carolyne, zu, sayn, wittgenstein, encouraged, berlioz, s, tentative, conception, of, an, opera, based, on, the, aeneid, having, first, completed, the, orchestration, of, his, 1841, song, cycle, les, nuits, d, t, he, began, work, on, les, troyens, the, trojans, writing, his, own, libretto, based, on, virgil, s, epic, he, worked, on, it, in, between, his, conducting, commitments, for, two, years, in, 1858, he, was, elected, to, the, institut, de, france, an, honour, he, had, long, sought, though, he, played, down, the, importance, he, attached, to, it, in, the, same, year, he, completed, les, troyens, he, then, spent, five, years, trying, to, have, it, staged, in, june, 1862, berlioz, s, wife, died, suddenly, aged, 48, she, was, survived, by, her, mother, to, whom, berlioz, was, devoted, and, who, looked, after, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, les, troyens, a, five, act, five, hour, opera, was, on, too, large, a, scale, to, be, acceptable, to, the, management, of, the, op, ra, and, berlioz, s, efforts, to, have, it, staged, there, failed, the, only, way, he, could, find, of, seeing, the, work, produced, was, to, divide, it, into, two, parts, the, fall, of, troy, and, the, trojans, at, carthage, the, latter, consisting, of, the, final, three, acts, of, the, original, was, presented, at, the, th, tre, lyrique, paris, in, november, 1863, but, even, that, truncated, version, was, further, truncated, during, the, run, of, 22, performances, number, after, number, was, cut, the, experience, demoralised, berlioz, who, wrote, no, more, music, after, this, berlioz, did, not, seek, a, revival, of, les, troyens, and, none, took, place, for, nearly, 30, years, he, sold, the, publishing, rights, for, a, large, sum, and, his, last, years, were, financially, comfortable, he, was, able, to, give, up, his, work, as, a, critic, but, he, lapsed, into, depression, as, well, as, losing, both, his, wives, he, had, lost, both, his, sisters, and, he, became, morbidly, aware, of, death, as, many, of, his, friends, and, other, contemporaries, died, he, and, his, son, had, grown, deeply, attached, to, each, other, but, louis, was, a, captain, in, the, merchant, navy, and, was, more, often, than, not, away, from, home, berlioz, s, physical, health, was, not, good, and, he, was, often, in, pain, from, an, intestinal, complaint, possibly, crohn, s, disease, after, the, death, of, his, second, wife, berlioz, had, two, romantic, interludes, during, 1862, he, met, probably, in, the, montmartre, cemetery, a, young, woman, less, than, half, his, age, whose, first, name, was, am, lie, and, whose, second, possibly, married, name, is, not, recorded, almost, nothing, is, known, of, their, relationship, which, lasted, for, less, than, a, year, after, they, ceased, to, meet, am, lie, died, aged, only, 26, berlioz, was, unaware, of, it, until, he, came, across, her, grave, six, months, later, cairns, hypothesises, that, the, shock, of, her, death, prompted, him, to, seek, out, his, first, love, estelle, now, a, widow, aged, 67, he, called, on, her, in, september, 1864, she, received, him, kindly, and, he, visited, her, in, three, successive, summers, he, wrote, to, her, nearly, every, month, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1867, berlioz, received, the, news, that, his, son, had, died, in, havana, of, yellow, fever, macdonald, suggests, that, berlioz, may, have, sought, distraction, from, his, grief, by, going, ahead, with, a, planned, series, of, concerts, in, st, petersburg, and, moscow, but, far, from, rejuvenating, him, the, trip, sapped, his, remaining, strength, the, concerts, were, successful, and, berlioz, received, a, warm, response, from, the, new, generation, of, russian, composers, and, the, general, public, but, he, returned, to, paris, visibly, unwell, he, went, to, nice, to, recuperate, in, the, mediterranean, climate, but, fell, on, rocks, by, the, shore, possibly, because, of, a, stroke, and, had, to, return, to, paris, where, he, convalesced, for, several, months, in, august, 1868, he, felt, able, to, travel, briefly, to, grenoble, to, judge, a, choral, festival, after, arriving, back, in, paris, he, gradually, grew, weaker, and, died, at, his, house, in, the, rue, de, calais, on, 8, march, 1869, at, the, age, of, 65, he, was, buried, in, montmartre, cemetery, with, his, two, wives, who, were, exhumed, and, re, buried, next, to, him, in, his, 1983, book, the, musical, language, of, berlioz, julian, rushton, asks, where, berlioz, comes, in, the, history, of, musical, forms, and, what, is, his, progeny, rushton, s, answers, to, these, questions, are, nowhere, and, none, he, cites, well, known, studies, of, musical, history, in, which, berlioz, is, mentioned, only, in, passing, or, not, at, all, and, suggests, that, this, is, partly, because, berlioz, had, no, models, among, his, predecessors, and, was, a, model, to, none, of, his, successors, in, his, works, as, in, his, life, berlioz, was, a, lone, wolf, forty, years, earlier, sir, thomas, beecham, a, lifelong, proponent, of, berlioz, s, music, commented, similarly, writing, that, although, for, example, mozart, was, a, greater, composer, his, music, drew, on, the, works, of, his, predecessors, whereas, berlioz, s, works, were, all, wholly, original, the, symphonie, fantastique, or, la, damnation, de, faust, broke, upon, the, world, like, some, unaccountable, effort, of, spontaneous, generation, which, had, dispensed, with, the, machinery, of, normal, parentage, rushton, suggests, that, berlioz, s, way, is, neither, architectural, nor, developmental, but, illustrative, he, judges, this, to, be, part, of, a, continuing, french, musical, aesthetic, favouring, a, decorative, rather, than, the, german, architectural, approach, to, composition, abstraction, and, discursiveness, are, alien, to, this, tradition, and, in, operas, and, to, a, large, extent, in, orchestral, music, there, is, little, continuous, development, instead, self, contained, numbers, or, sections, are, preferred, berlioz, s, compositional, techniques, have, been, strongly, criticised, and, equally, strongly, defended, it, is, common, ground, for, critics, and, defenders, that, his, approach, to, harmony, and, musical, structure, conforms, to, no, established, rules, his, detractors, ascribe, this, to, ignorance, and, his, proponents, to, independent, minded, adventurousness, his, approach, to, rhythm, caused, perplexity, to, conservatively, inclined, contemporaries, he, hated, the, phrase, carr, e, the, unvaried, four, or, eight, bar, phrase, and, introduced, new, varieties, of, rhythm, to, his, music, he, explained, his, practice, in, an, 1837, article, accenting, weak, beats, at, the, expense, of, the, strong, alternating, triple, and, duple, groups, of, notes, and, using, unexpected, rhythmic, themes, independent, of, the, main, melody, macdonald, writes, that, berlioz, was, a, natural, melodist, but, that, his, rhythmic, sense, led, him, away, from, regular, phrase, lengths, he, spoke, naturally, in, a, kind, of, flexible, musical, prose, with, surprise, and, contour, important, elements, berlioz, s, approach, to, harmony, and, counterpoint, was, idiosyncratic, and, has, provoked, adverse, criticism, pierre, boulez, commented, there, are, awkward, harmonies, in, berlioz, that, make, one, scream, in, rushton, s, analysis, most, of, berlioz, s, melodies, have, clear, tonal, and, harmonic, implications, but, the, composer, sometimes, chose, not, to, harmonise, accordingly, rushton, observes, that, berlioz, s, preference, for, irregular, rhythm, subverts, conventional, harmony, classic, and, romantic, melody, usually, implies, harmonic, motion, of, some, consistency, and, smoothness, berlioz, s, aspiration, to, musical, prose, tends, to, resist, such, consistency, the, pianist, and, musical, analyst, charles, rosen, has, written, that, berlioz, often, sets, the, climax, of, his, melodies, in, relief, with, the, most, emphatic, chord, a, triad, in, root, position, and, often, a, tonic, chord, where, the, melody, leads, the, listener, to, expect, a, dominant, he, gives, as, an, example, the, second, phrase, of, the, main, theme, the, id, e, fixe, of, the, symphonie, fantastique, famous, for, its, shock, to, classical, sensibilities, in, which, the, melody, implies, a, dominant, at, its, climax, resolved, by, a, tonic, but, in, which, berlioz, anticipates, the, resolution, by, putting, a, tonic, under, the, climactic, note, even, among, those, unsympathetic, to, his, music, few, deny, that, berlioz, was, a, master, of, orchestration, richard, strauss, wrote, that, berlioz, invented, the, modern, orchestra, some, of, those, who, recognise, berlioz, s, mastery, of, orchestration, nonetheless, dislike, a, few, of, his, more, extreme, effects, the, pedal, point, for, trombones, in, the, hostias, section, of, the, requiem, is, often, cited, some, musicians, such, as, gordon, jacob, have, found, the, effect, unpleasant, macdonald, has, questioned, berlioz, s, fondness, for, divided, cellos, and, basses, in, dense, low, chords, but, he, emphasises, that, such, contentious, points, are, rare, compared, with, the, felicities, and, masterstrokes, abounding, in, the, scores, berlioz, took, instruments, hitherto, used, for, special, purposes, and, introduced, them, into, his, regular, orchestra, macdonald, mentions, the, harp, the, cor, anglais, the, bass, clarinet, and, the, valve, trumpet, among, the, characteristic, touches, in, berlioz, s, orchestration, singled, out, by, macdonald, are, the, wind, chattering, on, repeated, notes, for, brilliance, or, being, used, to, add, sombre, colour, to, romeo, s, arrival, at, the, capulets, vault, and, the, ch, ur, d, ombres, in, l, lio, of, berlioz, s, brass, he, writes, brass, can, be, solemn, or, brazen, the, marche, au, supplice, in, the, symphonie, fantastique, is, a, defiantly, modern, use, of, brass, trombones, introduce, mephistopheles, with, three, flashing, chords, or, support, the, gloomy, doubts, of, narbal, in, les, troyens, with, a, hiss, of, cymbals, pianissimo, they, mark, the, entry, of, the, cardinal, in, benvenuto, cellini, and, the, blessing, of, little, astyanax, by, priam, in, les, troyens, berlioz, wrote, four, large, scale, works, he, called, symphonies, but, his, conception, of, the, genre, differed, greatly, from, the, classical, pattern, of, the, german, tradition, with, rare, exceptions, such, as, beethoven, s, ninth, a, symphony, was, taken, to, be, a, large, scale, wholly, orchestral, work, usually, in, four, movements, using, sonata, form, in, the, first, movement, and, sometimes, in, others, some, pictorial, touches, were, included, in, symphonies, by, beethoven, mendelssohn, and, others, but, the, symphony, was, not, customarily, used, to, recount, a, narrative, all, four, of, berlioz, s, symphonies, differ, from, the, contemporary, norm, the, first, the, symphonie, fantastique, 1830, is, purely, orchestral, and, the, opening, movement, is, broadly, in, sonata, form, but, the, work, tells, a, story, graphically, and, specifically, the, recurring, id, e, fixe, theme, is, the, composer, s, idealised, and, in, the, last, movement, caricatured, portrait, of, harriet, smithson, schumann, wrote, of, the, work, that, despite, its, apparent, formlessness, there, is, an, inherent, symmetrical, order, corresponding, to, the, great, dimensions, of, the, work, and, this, besides, the, inner, connexions, of, thought, and, in, the, 20th, century, constant, lambert, wrote, formally, speaking, it, is, among, the, finest, of, 19th, century, symphonies, the, work, has, always, been, among, berlioz, s, most, popular, harold, in, italy, despite, its, subtitle, symphony, in, four, parts, with, viola, principal, is, described, by, the, musicologist, mark, evan, bonds, as, a, work, traditionally, seen, as, lacking, any, direct, historical, antecedent, a, hybrid, of, symphony, and, concerto, that, owes, little, or, nothing, to, the, earlier, lighter, genre, of, the, symphonie, concertante, in, the, 20th, century, critical, opinion, varied, about, the, work, even, among, those, well, disposed, to, berlioz, felix, weingartner, an, early, 20th, century, champion, of, the, composer, wrote, in, 1904, that, it, did, not, reach, the, level, of, the, symphonie, fantastique, fifty, years, later, edward, sackville, west, and, desmond, shawe, taylor, found, it, romantic, and, picturesque, berlioz, at, his, best, in, the, 21st, century, bonds, ranks, it, among, the, greatest, works, of, its, kind, in, the, 19th, century, the, dramatic, symphony, with, chorus, rom, o, et, juliette, 1839, is, still, further, from, the, traditional, symphonic, model, the, episodes, of, shakespeare, s, drama, are, represented, in, orchestral, music, interspersed, with, expository, and, narrative, sections, for, voices, among, berlioz, s, admirers, the, work, divides, opinion, weingartner, called, it, a, style, less, mixture, of, different, forms, not, quite, oratorio, not, quite, opera, not, quite, symphony, fragments, of, all, three, and, nothing, perfect, countering, accusations, of, lack, of, unity, in, this, and, other, berlioz, works, emmanuel, chabrier, replied, in, a, single, emphatic, word, cairns, regards, the, work, as, symphonic, albeit, a, bold, extension, of, the, genre, but, he, notes, that, other, berliozians, including, wilfrid, mellers, view, it, as, a, curious, not, entirely, convincing, compromise, between, symphonic, and, operatic, techniques, rushton, comments, that, pronounced, unity, is, not, among, the, virtues, of, the, work, but, he, argues, that, to, close, one, s, mind, on, that, account, is, to, miss, all, that, the, music, has, to, give, the, last, of, the, four, symphonies, is, the, symphonie, funebre, et, triomphale, for, giant, brass, and, woodwind, band, 1840, with, string, parts, added, later, together, with, optional, chorus, the, structure, is, more, conventional, than, the, instrumentation, the, first, movement, is, in, sonata, form, but, there, are, only, two, other, movements, and, berlioz, did, not, adhere, to, the, traditional, relationship, between, the, various, keys, of, the, piece, wagner, called, the, symphony, popular, in, the, most, ideal, sense, every, urchin, in, a, blue, blouse, would, thoroughly, understand, it, none, of, berlioz, s, three, completed, operas, were, written, to, commission, and, theatre, managers, were, not, enthusiastic, about, staging, them, cairns, writes, that, unlike, meyerbeer, who, was, rich, influential, and, deferred, to, by, opera, managements, berlioz, was, an, opera, composer, on, sufferance, one, who, composed, on, borrowed, time, paid, for, with, money, that, was, not, his, but, lent, by, a, wealthy, friend, the, three, operas, contrast, strongly, with, one, another, the, first, benvenuto, cellini, 1838, inspired, by, the, memoirs, of, the, florentine, sculptor, is, an, opera, semiseria, seldom, staged, until, the, 21st, century, when, there, have, been, signs, of, a, revival, in, its, fortunes, with, its, first, production, at, the, metropolitan, opera, 2003, and, a, co, production, by, the, english, national, opera, and, the, op, ra, national, de, paris, 2014, but, it, remains, the, least, often, produced, of, the, three, operas, in, 2008, the, music, critic, michael, quinn, called, it, an, opera, overflowing, in, every, way, with, musical, gold, bursting, from, each, curve, and, crevice, a, score, of, continually, stupendous, brilliance, and, invention, but, agreed, with, the, general, view, of, the, libretto, incoherent, episodic, too, epic, to, be, comedy, too, ironic, for, tragedy, berlioz, welcomed, liszt, s, help, in, revising, the, work, streamlining, the, confusing, plot, for, his, other, two, operas, he, wrote, his, own, libretti, the, epic, les, troyens, 1858, is, described, by, the, musical, scholar, james, haar, as, incontestably, berlioz, s, masterpiece, a, view, shared, by, many, other, writers, berlioz, based, the, text, on, virgil, s, aeneid, depicting, the, fall, of, troy, and, subsequent, travels, of, the, hero, holoman, describes, the, poetry, of, the, libretto, as, old, fashioned, for, its, day, but, effective, and, at, times, beautiful, the, opera, consists, of, a, series, of, self, contained, numbers, but, they, form, a, continuous, narrative, with, the, orchestra, playing, a, vital, part, in, expounding, and, commenting, on, the, action, although, the, work, plays, for, five, hours, including, intervals, it, is, no, longer, the, normal, practice, to, present, it, across, two, evenings, les, troyens, in, holoman, s, view, embodies, the, composer, s, artistic, creed, the, union, of, music, and, poetry, holds, incomparably, greater, power, than, either, art, alone, the, last, of, berlioz, s, operas, is, the, shakespearean, comedy, b, atrice, et, b, n, dict, 1862, written, the, composer, said, as, a, relaxation, after, his, efforts, with, les, troyens, he, described, it, as, a, caprice, written, with, the, point, of, a, needle, his, libretto, based, on, much, ado, about, nothing, omits, shakespeare, s, darker, sub, plots, and, replaces, the, clowns, dogberry, and, verges, with, an, invention, of, his, own, the, tiresome, and, pompous, music, master, somarone, the, action, focuses, on, the, sparring, between, the, two, leading, characters, but, the, score, contains, some, gentler, music, such, as, the, nocturne, duet, nuit, paisible, et, sereine, the, beauty, of, which, cairns, suggests, matches, or, surpasses, the, love, music, in, rom, o, or, les,

la, damnation, de, faust, although, not, written, for, the, theatre, is, sometimes, staged, as, an, opera, berlioz, gained, a, reputation, only, partly, justified, for, liking, gigantic, orchestral, and, choral, forces, in, france, there, was, a, tradition, of, open, air, performance, dating, from, the, revolution, calling, for, larger, ensembles, than, were, needed, in, the, concert, hall, among, the, generation, of, french, composers, ahead, of, him, cherubini, m, hul, gossec, and, berlioz, s, teacher, le, sueur, all, wrote, for, huge, forces, on, occasion, and, in, the, requiem, and, to, a, lesser, degree, the, te, deum, berlioz, follows, them, in, his, own, manner, the, requiem, calls, for, sixteen, timpani, quadruple, woodwind, and, twelve, horns, but, the, moments, when, the, full, orchestral, sound, is, unleashed, are, few, the, dies, irae, is, one, such, and, most, of, the, requiem, is, notable, for, its, restraint, the, orchestra, does, not, play, at, all, in, the, quaerens, me, section, and, what, cairns, calls, the, apocalyptic, armoury, is, reserved, for, special, moments, of, colour, and, emphasis, its, purpose, is, not, merely, spectacular, but, architectural, to, clarify, the, musical, structure, and, open, up, multiple, perspectives, what, macdonald, calls, berlioz, s, monumental, manner, is, more, prominent, in, the, te, deum, composed, in, 1849, and, first, heard, in, 1855, when, it, was, given, in, connection, with, the, exposition, universelle, by, that, time, the, composer, had, added, to, its, two, choruses, a, part, for, massed, children, s, voices, inspired, by, hearing, a, choir, of, 6, 500, children, singing, in, st, paul, s, cathedral, during, his, london, trip, in, 1851, a, cantata, for, double, chorus, and,

a, rarity, la, damnation, de, faust, though, conceived, as, a, work, for, the, concert, hall, did, not, achieve, success, in, france, until, it, was, staged, as, an, opera, long, after, the, composer, s, death, within, a, year, of, raoul, gunsbourg, s, production, of, the, piece, at, monte, carlo, in, 1893, the, work, was, presented, as, an, opera, in, italy, germany, britain, russia, and, the, us, the, many, elements, of, the, work, vary, from, the, robust, hungarian, march, near, the, beginning, to, the, delicate, dance, of, the, sylphs, the, frenetic, ride, to, the, abyss, m, phistoph, l, s,

faust, in, mixing, dramatic, action, and, philosophic, reflection, berlioz, after, a, brief, youthful, religious, spell, was, a, lifelong, agnostic, but, he, was, not, hostile, to, the, roman, catholic, church, and, macdonald, calls, the, serenely, contemplative, end, of, the, work, the, nearest, berlioz, ever, came, to, a, devoutly, christian, mode, of, expression, berlioz, wrote, songs, throughout, his, career, but, not, prolifically, his, best, known, work, in, the, genre, is, the, song, cycle, les, nuits, d, t, a, group, of, six, songs, originally, for, voice, and, piano, but, now, usually, heard, in, its, later, orchestrated, form, he, suppressed, some, of, his, early, songs, and, his, last, publication, in, 1865, was, the, 33, m, lodies, collecting, into, one, volume, all, his, songs, that, he, chose, to, preserve, some, of, them, such, as, h, l, ne, and, sara, la, baigneuse, exist, in, versions, for, four, voices, with, accompaniment, and, there, are, others, for, two, or, three, voices, berlioz, later, orchestrated, some, of, the, songs, originally, written, with, piano, accompaniment, and, some, such, as, za, de, and, le, chasseur, danois, were, written, with, alternative, piano, or, orchestral, parts, la, captive, to, words, by, victor, hugo, exists, in, six, different, versions, in, its, final, version, 1849, it, was, described, by, the, berlioz, scholar, tom, s, wotton, as, like, a, miniature, symphonic, poem, the, first, version, written, at, the, villa, medici, had, been, in, fairly, regular, rhythm, but, for, his, revision, berlioz, made, the, strophic, outline, less, clear, cut, and, added, optional, orchestral, parts, for, the, last, stanza, which, brings, the, song, to, a, quiet, close, the, songs, remain, on, the, whole, among, the, least, known, of, berlioz, s, works, and, john, warrack, suggests, that, schumann, identified, why, this, might, be, so, the, shape, of, the, melodies, is, as, usual, with, berlioz, not, straightforward, and, to, those, used, to, the, regular, four, bar, phrases, of, french, or, german, song, this, is, an, obstacle, to, appreciation, warrack, also, comments, that, the, piano, parts, though, not, lacking, in, harmonic, interest, are, discernibly, written, by, a, non, pianist, despite, that, warrack, considers, up, to, a, dozen, songs, from, the, 33, m, lodies, well, worth, exploring, among, them, are, some, masterpieces, berlioz, s, literary, output, was, considerable, and, mostly, consists, of, music, criticism, some, was, collected, and, published, in, book, form, his, treatise, on, instrumentation, 1844, began, as, a, series, of, articles, and, remained, a, standard, work, on, orchestration, throughout, the, 19th, century, when, richard, strauss, was, commissioned, to, revise, it, in, 1905, he, added, new, material, but, did, not, change, berlioz, s, original, text, the, revised, form, remained, widely, used, well, into, the, 20th, century, a, new, english, translation, was, published, in, 1948, other, selections, from, berlioz, s, press, columns, were, published, in, les, soir, es, de, l, orchestre, evenings, with, the, orchestra, 1852, les, grotesques, de, la, musique, 1859, and, travers, chants, through, songs, 1862, his, m, moires, were, published, posthumously, in, 1870, macdonald, comments, that, there, are, few, facets, of, musical, practice, of, the, time, untouched, in, berlioz, s, feuilletons, he, professed, to, dislike, writing, his, press, pieces, and, they, undoubtedly, took, up, time, that, he, would, have, preferred, to, spend, writing, music, his, excellence, as, a, witty, and, perceptive, critic, may, have, worked, to, his, disadvantage, in, another, way, he, became, so, well, known, to, the, french, public, in, that, capacity, that, his, stature, as, a, composer, became, correspondingly, more, difficult, to, establish, the, first, biography, of, berlioz, by, eug, ne, de, mirecourt, was, published, during, the, composer, s, lifetime, holoman, lists, six, other, french, biographies, of, the, composer, published, in, the, four, decades, after, his, death, of, those, who, wrote, for, and, against, berlioz, s, music, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, among, the, most, outspoken, were, musical, amateurs, such, as, the, lawyer, and, diarist, george, templeton, strong, who, called, the, composer, s, music, variously, flatulent, rubbish, and, the, work, of, a, tipsy, chimpanzee, and, in, the, pro, berlioz, camp, the, poet, and, journalist, walter, j, turner, who, wrote, what, cairns, calls, exaggerated, eulogies, like, strong, turner, was, in, the, words, of, the, music, critic, charles, reid, unhampered, by, any, excess, of, technical, knowledge, serious, studies, of, berlioz, in, the, 20th, century, began, with, adolphe, boschot, s, l, histoire, d, un, romantique, three, volumes, 1906, 1913, his, successors, were, tom, s, wotton, author, of, a, 1935, biography, and, julien, tiersot, who, wrote, numerous, scholarly, articles, on, berlioz, and, began, the, collection, and, editing, of, the, composer, s, letters, a, process, eventually, completed, in, 2016, eighty, years, after, tiersot, s, death, in, the, early, 1950s, the, best, known, berlioz, scholar, was, jacques, barzun, a, prot, g, of, wotton, and, like, him, strongly, hostile, to, many, of, boschot, s, conclusions, which, they, saw, as, unfairly, critical, of, the, composer, barzun, s, study, was, published, in, 1950, he, was, accused, at, the, time, by, the, musicologist, winton, dean, of, being, excessively, partisan, and, refusing, to, admit, failings, and, unevenness, in, berlioz, s, music, more, recently, he, has, been, credited, by, the, musicologist, nicholas, temperley, with, playing, a, major, part, in, improving, the, climate, of, musical, opinion, towards, berlioz, since, barzun, the, leading, berlioz, scholars, have, included, david, cairns, d, kern, holoman, hugh, macdonald, and, julian, rushton, cairns, translated, and, edited, berlioz, s, m, moires, in, 1969, and, published, a, two, volume, 1500, page, study, of, the, composer, 1989, and, 1999, described, in, grove, s, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, as, one, of, the, masterpieces, of, modern, biography, holoman, was, responsible, for, the, publication, in, 1987, of, the, first, thematic, catalogue, of, berlioz, s, works, two, years, later, he, published, a, single, volume, biography, of, the, composer, macdonald, was, appointed, in, 1967, as, the, inaugural, general, editor, of, the, new, berlioz, edition, published, by, b, renreiter, 26, volumes, were, issued, between, 1967, and, 2006, under, his, editorship, he, is, also, one, of, the, editors, of, berlioz, s, correspondance, g, n, rale, and, author, of, a, 1978, study, of, berlioz, s, orchestral, music, and, of, the, grove, article, on, the, composer, rushton, has, published, two, volumes, of, analyses, of, berlioz, s, music, 1983, and, 2001, the, critic, rosemary, wilson, said, of, his, work, he, has, done, more, than, any, other, writer, to, explain, the, uniqueness, of, berlioz, s, musical, style, without, losing, a, sense, of, wonder, in, its, originality, of, musical, expression, no, other, composer, so, controversial, as, hector, berlioz, feelings, about, the, merits, of, his, music, are, seldom, lukewarm, it, has, always, tended, to, excite, either, uncritical, admiration, or, unfair, disparagement, the, record, guide, 1955, because, few, of, berlioz, s, works, were, often, performed, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, widely, accepted, views, of, his, music, were, based, on, hearsay, rather, than, on, the, music, itself, orthodox, opinion, emphasised, supposed, technical, defects, in, the, music, and, ascribed, to, the, composer, characteristics, that, he, did, not, possess, debussy, called, him, a, monster, not, a, musician, at, all, he, creates, the, illusion, of, music, by, means, borrowed, from, literature, and, painting, in, 1904, in, the, second, edition, of, grove, henry, hadow, made, this, judgment, the, remarkable, inequality, of, his, composition, may, be, explained, in, any, rate, in, part, as, the, work, of, a, vivid, imagination, striving, to, explain, itself, in, a, tongue, which, he, never, perfectly, understood, by, the, 1950s, the, critical, climate, was, changing, although, in, 1954, the, fifth, edition, of, grove, carried, this, verdict, from, l, on, vallas, berlioz, in, truth, never, did, contrive, to, express, what, he, aimed, at, in, the, impeccable, manner, he, desired, his, boundless, artistic, ambition, was, nourished, by, no, more, than, a, melodic, gift, of, no, great, amplitude, clumsy, harmonic, procedures, and, a, pen, without, pliancy, cairns, dismisses, the, article, as, an, astonishing, anthology, of, all, the, nonsense, that, has, ever, been, talked, about, but, adds, that, by, the, 1960s, it, seemed, a, quaint, survival, from, a, vanished, age, by, 1963, cairns, viewing, berlioz, s, greatness, as, firmly, established, felt, able, to, advise, anyone, writing, on, the, subject, do, not, keep, harping, on, the, strangeness, of, berlioz, s, music, you, will, no, longer, carry, the, reader, with, you, and, do, not, use, phrases, like, genius, without, talent, a, certain, strain, of, amateurishness, curiously, uneven, they, have, had, their, day, one, important, reason, for, the, steep, rise, in, berlioz, s, reputation, and, popularity, is, the, introduction, of, the, lp, record, after, the, second, world, war, in, 1950, barzun, made, the, point, that, although, berlioz, was, praised, by, his, artistic, peers, including, schumann, wagner, c, sar, franck, and, modest, mussorgsky, the, public, had, heard, little, of, his, music, until, recordings, became, widely, available, barzun, maintained, that, many, myths, had, grown, up, about, the, supposed, quirkiness, or, ineptitude, of, the, music, myths, that, were, dispelled, once, the, works, were, finally, made, available, for, all, to, hear, neville, cardus, made, a, similar, point, in, 1955, as, more, and, more, berlioz, works, became, widely, available, on, record, professional, musicians, and, critics, and, the, musical, public, were, for, the, first, time, able, to, judge, for, themselves, a, milestone, in, the, reappraisal, of, berlioz, s, reputation, came, in, 1957, when, for, the, first, time, a, professional, opera, company, staged, the, original, version, of, the, trojans, in, a, single, evening, it, was, at, the, royal, opera, house, covent, garden, the, work, was, sung, in, english, with, some, minor, cuts, but, its, importance, was, internationally, recognised, and, led, to, the, world, premiere, staging, of, the, work, uncut, and, in, french, at, covent, garden, in, 1969, marking, the, centenary, of, the, composer, s, death, in, recent, decades, berlioz, has, been, widely, regarded, as, a, great, composer, prone, to, lapses, like, any, other, in, 1999, the, composer, and, critic, bayan, northcott, wrote, that, the, work, of, cairns, rushton, sir, colin, davis, and, others, retained, the, embattled, conviction, of, a, cause, nevertheless, northcott, was, writing, about, davis, s, berlioz, odyssey, of, seventeen, concerts, of, berlioz, s, music, featuring, all, the, major, works, a, prospect, unimaginable, in, earlier, decades, of, the, century, northcott, concluded, berlioz, still, seems, so, immediate, so, controversial, so, ever, new, all, of, berlioz, s, major, works, and, most, of, his, minor, ones, have, been, commercially, recorded, this, is, a, comparatively, recent, development, in, the, mid, 1950s, the, international, record, catalogues, listed, complete, recordings, of, seven, major,

from, les, troyens, were, available, but, there, were, no, complete, recordings, of, the, operas, recordings, conducted, by, colin, davis, are, prominent, in, the, berlioz, discography, some, studio,
