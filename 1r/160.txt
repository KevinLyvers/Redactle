alberto, giacometti, d, k, m, t, i, us, also, d, k, italian, 10, october, 1901, 11, january, 1966, was, a, swiss, sculptor, painter, draftsman, and, printmaker, beginning, in, 1922, he, lived, and, worked, mainly, in, paris, but, regularly, visited, his, hometown, borgonovo, to, see, his, family, and, work, on, his, art, giacometti, was, one, of, the, most, important, sculptors, of, the, 20th, century, his, work, was, particularly, influenced, by, artistic, styles, such, as, cubism, and, surrealism, philosophical, questions, about, the, human, condition, as, well, as, existential, and, phenomenological, debates, played, a, significant, role, in, his, work, around, 1935, he, gave, up, on, his, surrealist, influences, to, pursue, a, more, deepened, analysis, of, figurative, compositions, giacometti, wrote, texts, for, periodicals, and, exhibition, catalogues, and, recorded, his, thoughts, and, memories, in, notebooks, and, diaries, his, critical, nature, led, to, self, doubt, about, his, own, work, and, his, self, perceived, inability, to, do, justice, to, his, own, artistic, vision, his, insecurities, nevertheless, remained, a, powerful, motivating, artistic, force, throughout, his, entire, life, between, 1938, and, 1944, giacometti, s, sculptures, had, a, maximum, height, of, seven, centimeters, 2, 75, inches, their, small, size, reflected, the, actual, distance, between, the, artist, s, position, and, his, model, in, this, context, he, self, critically, stated, but, wanting, to, create, from, memory, what, i, had, seen, to, my, terror, the, sculptures, became, smaller, and, smaller, after, world, war, ii, giacometti, created, his, most, famous, sculptures, his, extremely, tall, and, slender, figurines, these, sculptures, were, subject, to, his, individual, viewing, experience, between, an, imaginary, yet, real, a, tangible, yet, inaccessible, space, in, giacometti, s, whole, body, of, work, his, painting, constitutes, only, a, small, part, after, 1957, however, his, figurative, paintings, were, equally, as, present, as, his, sculptures, the, almost, monochrome, paintings, of, his, late, work, do, not, refer, to, any, other, artistic, styles, of, modernity, giacometti, was, born, in, borgonovo, switzerland, the, eldest, of, four, children, of, giovanni, giacometti, a, well, known, post, impressionist, painter, and, annetta, giacometti, stampa, he, was, a, descendant, of, protestant, refugees, escaping, the, inquisition, coming, from, an, artistic, background, he, was, interested, in, art, from, an, early, age, and, was, encouraged, by, his, father, and, godfather, alberto, attended, the, geneva, school, of, fine, arts, his, brothers, diego, 1902, 1985, and, bruno, 1907, 2012, would, go, on, to, become, artists, and, architects, as, well, additionally, his, cousin, zaccaria, giacometti, later, professor, of, constitutional, law, and, chancellor, of, the, university, of, zurich, grew, up, together, with, them, having, been, orphaned, at, the, age, of, 12, in, 1905, in, 1922, he, moved, to, paris, to, study, under, the, sculptor, antoine, bourdelle, an, associate, of, rodin, it, was, there, that, giacometti, experimented, with, cubism, and, surrealism, and, came, to, be, regarded, as, one, of, the, leading, surrealist, sculptors, among, his, associates, were, mir, max, ernst, picasso, bror, hjorth, and, balthus, between, 1936, and, 1940, giacometti, concentrated, his, sculpting, on, the, human, head, focusing, on, the, sitter, s, gaze, he, preferred, models, he, was, close, to, his, sister, and, the, artist, isabel, rawsthorne, then, known, as, isabel, delmer, this, was, followed, by, a, phase, in, which, his, statues, of, isabel, became, stretched, out, her, limbs, elongated, obsessed, with, creating, his, sculptures, exactly, as, he, envisioned, through, his, unique, view, of, reality, he, often, carved, until, they, were, as, thin, as, nails, and, reduced, to, the, size, of, a, pack, of, cigarettes, much, to, his, consternation, a, friend, of, his, once, said, that, if, giacometti, decided, to, sculpt, you, he, would, make, your, head, look, like, the, blade, of, a, knife, during, world, war, ii, giacometti, took, refuge, in, switzerland, there, in, 1946, he, met, annette, arm, a, secretary, for, the, red, cross, they, married, in, 1949, after, his, marriage, his, tiny, sculptures, became, larger, but, the, larger, they, grew, the, thinner, they, became, for, the, remainder, of, giacometti, s, life, annette, was, his, main, female, model, his, paintings, underwent, a, parallel, procedure, the, figures, appear, isolated, and, severely, attenuated, as, the, result, of, continuous, reworking, he, frequently, revisited, his, subjects, one, of, his, favourite, models, was, his, younger, brother, diego, with, whom, he, shared, his, studio, in, paris, in, 1958, giacometti, was, asked, to, create, a, monumental, sculpture, for, the, chase, manhattan, bank, building, in, new, york, which, was, beginning, construction, although, he, had, for, many, years, harbored, an, ambition, to, create, work, for, a, public, square, he, had, never, set, foot, in, new, york, and, knew, nothing, about, life, in, a, rapidly, evolving, metropolis, nor, had, he, ever, laid, eyes, on, an, actual, skyscraper, according, to, his, biographer, james, lord, giacometti, s, work, on, the, project, resulted, in, the, four, figures, of, standing, women, his, largest, sculptures, entitled, grande, femme, debout, i, through, iv, 1960, the, commission, was, never, completed, however, because, giacometti, was, unsatisfied, by, the, relationship, between, the, sculpture, and, the, site, and, abandoned, the, project, in, 1962, giacometti, was, awarded, the, grand, prize, for, sculpture, at, the, venice, biennale, and, the, award, brought, with, it, worldwide, fame, even, when, he, had, achieved, popularity, and, his, work, was, in, demand, he, still, reworked, models, often, destroying, them, or, setting, them, aside, to, be, returned, to, years, later, the, prints, produced, by, giacometti, are, often, overlooked, but, the, catalogue, raisonn, giacometti, the, complete, graphics, and, 15, drawings, by, herbert, lust, tudor, 1970, comments, on, their, impact, and, gives, details, of, the, number, of, copies, of, each, print, some, of, his, most, important, images, were, in, editions, of, only, 30, and, many, were, described, as, rare, in, 1970, in, his, later, years, giacometti, s, works, were, shown, in, a, number, of, large, exhibitions, throughout, europe, riding, a, wave, of, international, popularity, and, despite, his, declining, health, he, traveled, to, the, united, states, in, 1965, for, an, exhibition, of, his, works, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, as, his, last, work, he, prepared, the, text, for, the, book, paris, sans, fin, a, sequence, of, 150, lithographs, containing, memories, of, all, the, places, where, he, had, lived, giacometti, died, in, 1966, of, heart, disease, pericarditis, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, at, the, kantonsspital, in, chur, switzerland, his, body, was, returned, to, his, birthplace, in, borgonovo, where, he, was, interred, close, to, his, parents, with, no, children, annette, giacometti, became, the, sole, holder, of, his, property, rights, she, worked, to, collect, a, full, listing, of, authenticated, works, by, her, late, husband, gathering, documentation, on, the, location, and, manufacture, of, his, works, and, working, to, fight, the, rising, number, of, counterfeited, works, when, she, died, in, 1993, the, fondation, giacometti, was, set, up, by, the, french, state, in, may, 2007, the, executor, of, his, widow, s, estate, former, french, foreign, minister, roland, dumas, was, convicted, of, illegally, selling, giacometti, s, works, to, a, top, auctioneer, jacques, tajan, who, was, also, convicted, both, were, ordered, to, pay, 850, 000, to, the, alberto, and, annette, giacometti, foundation, regarding, giacometti, s, sculptural, technique, and, according, to, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, the, rough, eroded, heavily, worked, surfaces, of, three, men, walking, ii, 1949, typify, his, technique, reduced, as, they, are, to, their, very, core, these, figures, evoke, lone, trees, in, winter, that, have, lost, their, foliage, within, this, style, giacometti, would, rarely, deviate, from, the, three, themes, that, preoccupied, him, the, walking, man, the, standing, nude, woman, and, the, bust, or, all, three, combined, in, various, groupings, in, a, letter, to, pierre, matisse, giacometti, wrote, figures, were, never, a, compact, mass, but, like, a, transparent, construction, in, the, letter, giacometti, writes, about, how, he, looked, back, at, the, realist, classical, busts, of, his, youth, with, nostalgia, and, tells, the, story, of, the, existential, crisis, which, precipitated, the, style, he, became, known, for, the, wish, to, make, compositions, with, figures, for, this, i, had, to, make, quickly, i, thought, in, passing, one, or, two, studies, from, nature, just, enough, to, understand, the, construction, of, a, head, of, a, whole, figure, and, in, 1935, i, took, a, model, this, study, should, take, i, thought, two, weeks, and, then, i, could, realize, my, compositions, i, worked, with, the, model, all, day, from, 1935, to, 1940, nothing, was, as, i, imagined, a, head, became, for, me, an, object, completely, unknown, and, without, dimensions, since, giacometti, achieved, exquisite, realism, with, facility, when, he, was, executing, busts, in, his, early, adolescence, giacometti, s, difficulty, in, re, approaching, the, figure, as, an, adult, is, generally, understood, as, a, sign, of, existential, struggle, for, meaning, rather, than, as, a, technical, deficit, giacometti, was, a, key, player, in, the, surrealist, art, movement, but, his, work, resists, easy, categorization, some, describe, it, as, formalist, others, argue, it, is, expressionist, or, otherwise, having, to, do, with, what, deleuze, calls, blocs, of, sensation, as, in, deleuze, s, analysis, of, francis, bacon, even, after, his, excommunication, from, the, surrealist, group, while, the, intention, of, his, sculpting, was, usually, imitation, the, end, products, were, an, expression, of, his, emotional, response, to, the, subject, he, attempted, to, create, renditions, of, his, models, the, way, he, saw, them, and, the, way, he, thought, they, ought, to, be, seen, he, once, said, that, he, was, sculpting, not, the, human, figure, but, the, shadow, that, is, cast, scholar, william, barrett, in, irrational, man, a, study, in, existential, philosophy, 1962, argues, that, the, attenuated, forms, of, giacometti, s, figures, reflect, the, view, of, 20th, century, modernism, and, existentialism, that, modern, life, is, increasingly, empty, and, devoid, of, meaning, all, the, sculptures, of, today, like, those, of, the, past, will, end, one, day, in, pieces, so, it, is, important, to, fashion, one, s, work, carefully, in, its, smallest, recess, and, charge, every, particle, of, matter, with, life, a, 2011, 2012, exhibition, at, the, pinacoth, que, de, paris, focused, on, showing, how, giacometti, was, inspired, by, etruscan, art, giacometti, is, best, known, for, the, bronze, sculptures, of, tall, thin, human, figures, made, in, the, years, 1945, to, 1960, giacometti, was, influenced, by, the, impressions, he, took, from, the, people, hurrying, in, the, big, city, people, in, motion, he, saw, as, a, succession, of, moments, of, stillness, the, emaciated, figures, are, often, interpreted, as, an, expression, of, the, existential, fear, insignificance, and, loneliness, of, mankind, the, mood, of, fear, in, the, period, of, the, 1940s, and, the, cold, war, is, reflected, in, this, figure, it, feels, sad, lonely, and, difficult, to, relate, to, giacometti, s, work, has, been, the, subject, of, numerous, solo, exhibitions, including, the, high, museum, of, art, atlanta, 1970, centre, pompidou, paris, 2007, 2008, pushkin, museum,
