and, regional, congressmen, mayors, and, councilmen, would, be, voted, for, on, the, same, day, going, into, the, elections, ch, vez, had, control, of, all, three, branches, of, government, for, the, position, of, president, ch, vez, s, closest, challenger, proved, to, be, his, former, friend, and, co, conspirator, in, the, 1992, coup, francisco, arias, c, rdenas, who, since, becoming, a, governor, of, zulia, state, had, turned, towards, the, political, centre, and, begun, to, denounce, ch, vez, as, autocratic, some, of, his, supporters, feared, that, he, had, alienated, those, in, the, middle, class, and, the, roman, catholic, church, hierarchy, who, had, formerly, supported, him, ch, vez, was, re, elected, with, 60, of, the, vote, a, larger, majority, than, his, 1998, electoral, victory, that, year, ch, vez, improved, ideological, ties, with, the, cuban, government, of, fidel, castro, by, signing, an, agreement, under, which, venezuela, would, supply, cuba, with, 53, 000, barrels, of, oil, per, day, at, preferential, rates, in, return, receiving, 20, 000, trained, cuban, medics, and, educators, in, the, ensuing, decade, this, would, be, increased, to, 90, 000, barrels, a, day, in, exchange, for, 40, 000, cuban, medics, and, teachers, dramatically, aiding, the, caribbean, island, s, economy, and, standard, of, living, after, its, special, period, of, the, 1990s, however, venezuela, s, growing, alliance, with, cuba, came, at, the, same, time, as, a, deteriorating, relationship, with, the, united, states, ch, vez, opposed, of, the, 2001, american, led, invasion, of, afghanistan, in, response, to, the, 11, september, attacks, against, the, u, s, by, islamist, militants, in, late, 2001, ch, vez, showed, pictures, on, his, television, show, of, children, said, to, be, killed, in, a, bombing, attack, he, commented, that, they, are, not, to, blame, for, the, terrorism, of, osama, bin, laden, or, anyone, else, called, on, the, american, government, to, end, the, massacre, of, the, innocents, and, describing, the, war, as, fighting, terrorism, with, terrorism, the, u, s, government, responded, negatively, to, the, comments, which, were, picked, up, by, the, media, worldwide, and, recalled, its, ambassador, for, consultations, meanwhile, the, 2000, elections, had, led, to, ch, vez, s, supporters, gaining, 101, out, of, 165, seats, in, the, venezuelan, national, assembly, and, so, in, november, 2001, they, voted, to, allow, him, to, pass, 49, social, and, economic, decrees, this, move, antagonized, the, opposition, movement, particularly, strongly, at, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, venezuela, was, the, world, s, fifth, largest, exporter, of, crude, oil, with, oil, accounting, for, 85, of, the, country, s, exports, therefore, dominating, the, country, s, economy, before, the, election, of, ch, vez, the, state, run, oil, company, petr, leos, de, venezuela, s, a, pdvsa, ran, autonomously, making, oil, decisions, based, on, internal, guidance, to, increase, profits, once, he, came, to, power, ch, vez, started, directing, pdvsa, and, effectively, turned, it, into, a, direct, government, arm, whose, profits, would, be, injected, into, social, spending, the, result, of, this, was, the, creation, of, bolivarian, missions, oil, funded, social, programs, targeting, poverty, literacy, hunger, and, more, in, 2001, the, government, introduced, a, new, hydrocarbons, law, through, which, it, sought, to, gain, greater, state, control, over, the, oil, industry, the, law, increased, the, transnational, companies, taxation, in, oil, extraction, activities, to, 30, and, set, the, minimum, state, participation, in, mixed, companies, at, 51, whereby, the, state, run, oil, company, petr, leos, de, venezuela, s, a, pdvsa, could, have, joint, control, with, private, companies, over, industry, by, 2006, all, of, the, 32, operating, agreements, signed, with, private, companies, during, the, 1990s, had, been, converted, from, being, primarily, or, privately, run, to, being, at, least, 51, controlled, by, pdvsa, ch, vez, had, also, removed, many, of, the, managers, and, executives, of, pdvsa, and, replaced, them, with, political, allies, stripping, the, state, owned, company, expertise, much, of, ch, vez, s, opposition, originated, from, the, response, to, the, cubanization, of, venezuela, ch, vez, s, popularity, dropped, due, to, his, relationship, with, fidel, castro, and, cuba, with, ch, vez, attempting, to, make, venezuela, in, cuba, s, image, ch, vez, following, castro, s, example, consolidated, the, country, s, bicameral, legislature, into, a, single, national, assembly, that, gave, him, more, power, and, created, community, groups, of, loyal, supporters, allegedly, trained, as, paramilitaries, such, actions, created, great, fear, among, venezuelans, who, felt, like, they, were, tricked, and, that, ch, vez, had, dictatorial, goals, the, first, organized, protest, against, the, bolivarian, government, occurred, in, january, 2001, when, the, ch, vez, administration, tried, to, implement, educational, reforms, through, the, proposed, resolution, 259, and, decree, 1, 011, which, would, have, seen, the, publication, of, textbooks, with, a, heavy, bolivarian, bias, parents, noticed, that, such, textbooks, were, really, cuban, books, filled, with, revolutionary, propaganda, outfitted, with, different, covers, the, protest, movement, which, was, primarily, by, middle, class, parents, whose, children, went, to, privately, run, schools, marched, to, central, caracas, shouting, out, the, slogan, con, mis, hijos, no, te, metas, don, t, mess, with, my, children, although, the, protesters, were, denounced, by, ch, vez, who, called, them, selfish, and, individualistic, the, protest, was, successful, enough, for, the, government, to, retract, the, proposed, education, reforms, and, instead, enter, into, a, consensus, based, educational, program, with, the, opposition, later, into, 2001, an, organization, known, as, the, coordinadora, democr, tica, de, acci, n, c, vica, democratic, coordinator, cd, was, founded, under, which, the, venezuelan, opposition, political, parties, corporate, powers, most, of, the, country, s, media, the, venezuelan, federation, of, chambers, of, commerce, the, institutional, military, front, and, the, central, workers, union, all, united, to, oppose, ch, vez, s, regime, the, prominent, businessman, pedro, carmona, 1941, was, chosen, as, the, cd, s, leader, the, coordinadora, democr, tica, and, other, opponents, of, ch, vez, s, bolivarian, government, accused, it, of, trying, to, turn, venezuela, from, a, democracy, into, a, dictatorship, by, centralising, power, amongst, its, supporters, in, the, constituent, assembly, and, granting, ch, vez, increasingly, autocratic, powers, many, of, them, pointed, to, ch, vez, s, personal, friendship, with, cuba, s, fidel, castro, and, the, one, party, socialist, government, in, cuba, as, a, sign, of, where, the, bolivarian, government, was, taking, venezuela, ch, vez, sought, to, make, pdvsa, his, main, source, of, funds, for, political, projects, and, replaced, oil, experts, with, political, allies, in, order, to, support, him, with, this, initiative, in, early, 2002, he, placed, a, leftist, professor, as, the, president, of, pdvsa, in, april, 2002, ch, vez, appointed, his, allies, to, head, the, pdvsa, and, replaced, the, company, s, board, of, directors, with, loyalists, who, had, little, or, no, experience, in, the, oil, industry, mocking, the, pdvsa, executives, on, television, as, he, fired, them, anger, with, ch, vez, s, decisions, led, to, civil, unrest, in, venezuela, which, culminated, in, an, attempted, coup, on, 11, april, 2002, during, a, march, headed, to, the, presidential, palace, nineteen, people, were, killed, and, over, 110, were, wounded, ch, vez, believed, that, the, best, way, to, stay, in, power, was, to, implement, plan, vila, military, officers, including, general, ra, l, baduel, a, founder, of, ch, vez, s, mbr, 200, then, decided, that, they, had, to, pull, support, from, ch, vez, to, deter, a, massacre, and, shortly, after, at, 8, 00, pm, v, squez, velasco, together, with, other, ranking, army, officers, declared, that, ch, vez, had, lost, his, support, ch, vez, agreed, to, be, detained, and, was, transferred, by, army, escort, to, la, orchila, business, leader, pedro, carmona, declared, himself, president, of, an, interim, government, carmona, abolished, the, 1999, constitution, and, appointed, a, governing, committee, protests, in, support, of, ch, vez, along, with, insufficient, support, for, carmona, s, government, quickly, led, to, carmona, s, resignation, and, ch, vez, was, returned, to, power, on, 14, april, ch, vez, s, response, was, to, moderate, his, approach, implementing, a, new, economic, team, that, appeared, to, be, more, centrist, and, reinstated, the, old, board, of, directors, and, managers, of, the, state, oil, company, petr, leos, de, venezuela, s, a, pdvsa, whose, replacement, had, been, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, coup, at, the, same, time, the, bolivarian, government, began, to, increase, the, country, s, military, capacity, purchasing, 100, 000, ak, 47, assault, rifles, and, several, helicopters, from, russia, as, well, as, a, number, of, super, tucano, light, attack, and, training, planes, from, brazil, troop, numbers, were, also, increased, ch, vez, faced, a, two, month, management, strike, at, the, pdvsa, the, ch, vez, government, s, response, was, to, fire, about, 19, 000, striking, employees, for, abandoning, their, posts, and, then, employing, retired, workers, foreign, contractors, and, the, military, to, do, their, jobs, instead, the, total, firing, of, tens, of, thousands, of, employees, by, ch, vez, would, forever, damage, venezuela, s, oil, industry, due, to, the, tremendous, loss, of, expertise, by, 2005, the, members, of, venezuela, s, energy, ministries, stated, it, would, take, more, than, 15, years, for, pdvsa, to, recover, from, ch, vez, s, actions, the, 1999, constitution, had, introduced, the, concept, of, a, recall, referendum, into, venezuelan, politics, so, the, opposition, called, for, such, a, referendum, to, take, place, the, resulting, 2004, referendum, to, recall, ch, vez, was, unsuccessful, 70, of, the, eligible, venezuelan, population, turned, out, to, vote, with, 59, of, voters, deciding, to, keep, the, president, in, power, in, january, 2005, ch, vez, began, openly, proclaiming, the, ideology, of, socialism, of, the, 21st, century, something, that, was, distinct, from, his, earlier, forms, of, bolivarianism, which, had, been, social, democratic, in, nature, merging, elements, of, capitalism, and, socialism, he, used, this, new, term, to, contrast, the, democratic, socialism, which, he, wanted, to, promote, in, latin, america, from, the, marxist, leninist, socialism, that, had, been, spread, by, socialist, states, like, the, soviet, union, and, the, people, s, republic, of, china, during, the, 20th, century, arguing, that, the, latter, had, not, been, truly, democratic, suffering, from, a, lack, of, participatory, democracy, and, an, excessively, authoritarian, governmental, structure, in, may, 2006, ch, vez, visited, europe, in, a, private, capacity, where, he, announced, plans, to, supply, cheap, venezuelan, oil, to, poor, working, class, communities, in, the, continent, the, mayor, of, london, ken, livingstone, welcomed, him, describing, him, as, the, best, news, out, of, latin, america, in, many, years, in, the, presidential, election, of, december, 2006, which, saw, a, 77, voter, turnout, ch, vez, was, once, more, elected, this, time, with, 63, of, the, vote, beating, his, closest, challenger, manuel, rosales, the, organization, of, american, states, oas, and, the, carter, center, concluded, that, the, election, results, were, free, and, legitimate, after, this, victory, ch, vez, promised, an, expansion, of, the, revolution, on, 15, december, 2006, ch, vez, publicly, announced, that, those, leftist, political, parties, who, had, continually, supported, him, in, the, patriotic, pole, would, unite, into, one, single, much, larger, party, the, united, socialist, party, of, venezuela, partido, socialista, unido, de, venezuela, psuv, in, the, speech, which, he, gave, announcing, the, psuv, s, creation, ch, vez, declared, that, the, old, parties, must, forget, their, own, structures, party, colours, and, slogans, because, they, are, not, the, most, important, thing, for, the, fatherland, ch, vez, had, initially, proclaimed, that, those, leftist, parties, which, chose, to, not, dissolve, into, the, psuv, would, have, to, leave, the, government, party, membership, rose, to, 5, 7, million, people, by, 2007, the, united, nations, international, labour, organization, expressed, concern, over, some, voters, being, pressured, to, join, the, party, on, 28, december, 2006, president, ch, vez, announced, that, the, government, would, not, renew, rctv, s, broadcast, license, which, expired, on, 27, may, 2007, thereby, forcing, the, channel, to, cease, operations, on, that, day, on, 17, may, 2007, the, government, rejected, a, plea, made, by, rctv, to, stop, the, tv, station, s, forced, shutdown, thousands, of, protesters, marching, both, against, and, in, support, of, the, government, s, decision, remained, on, the, streets, in, caracas, other, marches, took, place, in, maracaibo, and, valencia, on, 21, may, 2007, hundreds, of, journalists, and, students, marched, in, caracas, carrying, a, banner, reading, s, o, s, freedom, of, expression, a, few, days, later, on, 25, may, 2007, university, students, from, the, universidad, cat, lica, andr, s, bello, the, universidad, sim, n, bol, var, and, the, universidad, central, de, venezuela, protested, against, the, government, s, intentions, on, 26, may, tens, of, thousands, of, protesters, marched, in, support, of, rctv, to, their, headquarters, since, the, week, prior, to, the, shutdown, of, rctv, many, individuals, international, organizations, and, ngos, including, the, oas, s, secretary, general, jos, miguel, insulza, and, its, special, rapporteur, for, freedom, of, expression, the, inter, american, press, association, human, rights, watch, and, the, committee, to, protect, journalists, have, expressed, concerns, for, freedom, of, the, press, following, the, shutdown, however, secretary, insulza, also, stated, that, it, was, up, to, the, venezuelan, courts, to, solve, this, dispute, and, that, he, believed, that, this, was, an, administrative, decision, in, 2007, the, bolivarian, government, set, up, a, constitutional, commission, in, order, to, review, the, 1999, constitution, and, suggest, potential, amendments, to, be, made, to, it, led, by, the, prominent, pro, ch, vez, intellectual, luis, britto, garc, a, it, suggested, measures, that, would, have, increased, many, of, the, president, s, powers, for, instance, increasing, the, presidential, term, limit, to, seven, years, allowing, the, president, to, run, for, election, indefinitely, and, centralizing, powers, in, the, executive, the, government, put, the, suggested, changes, to, a, public, referendum, in, december, 2007, abstention, rate, was, high, however, with, 44, of, registered, voters, not, turning, out, and, in, the, end, the, proposed, changes, were, rejected, by, 51, of, votes, this, would, prove, to, the, first, electoral, loss, that, ch, vez, had, faced, in, the, thirteen, electoral, contests, held, since, he, took, power, due, to, the, top, down, nature, of, the, changes, as, well, as, general, public, dissatisfaction, with, the, absence, of, internal, debate, on, its, content, as, well, as, dissatisfaction, with, the, running, of, the, social, programmes, increasing, street, crime, and, with, corruption, within, the, government, in, mid, 2010, tons, of, rotten, food, supplies, imported, during, ch, vez, s, government, through, subsidies, of, state, owned, enterprise, pdval, were, found, due, to, the, scandal, pdval, started, being, administrated, by, the, vice, president, of, venezuela, and, afterwards, by, the, alimentation, ministry, three, former, managers, were, detained, but, were, released, afterwards, and, two, of, them, had, their, positions, restored, in, july, 2010, official, estimates, stated, that, 130, 000, tons, of, food, supplies, were, affected, while, the, political, opposition, informed, of, 170, 000, tons, as, of, 2012, any, advances, in, the, investigations, by, the, national, assembly, were, unknown, the, most, accepted, explanation, of, the, loss, of, food, supplies, is, the, organization, of, pdval, because, the, food, network, allegedly, imported, supplies, faster, than, what, it, could, distribute, them, the, opposition, considers, the, affair, as, a, corrupt, case, and, spokespeople, have, assured, that, the, public, officials, deliberately, imported, more, food, that, could, be, distributed, to, embezzle, funds, through, the, import, of, subsidized, supplies, in, order, to, ensure, that, his, bolivarian, revolution, became, socially, ingrained, in, venezuela, ch, vez, discussed, his, wish, to, stand, for, re, election, when, his, term, ran, out, in, 2013, and, spoke, of, ruling, beyond, 2030, under, the, 1999, constitution, he, could, not, legally, stand, for, re, election, again, and, so, brought, about, a, referendum, on, 15, february, 2009, to, abolish, the, two, term, limit, for, all, public, offices, including, the, presidency, approximately, 70, of, the, venezuelan, electorate, voted, and, they, approved, this, alteration, to, the, constitution, with, over, 54, in, favor, allowing, any, elected, official, the, chance, to, try, to, run, indefinitely, on, 7, october, 2012, ch, vez, won, election, as, president, for, a, fourth, time, his, third, six, year, term, he, defeated, henrique, capriles, with, 54, of, the, votes, versus, 45, for, capriles, which, was, a, lower, victory, margin, than, in, his, previous, presidential, wins, in, the, 2012, venezuelan, presidential, election, turnout, in, the, election, was, 80, with, a, hotly, contested, election, between, the, two, candidates, there, was, significant, support, for, ch, vez, amongst, the, venezuelan, lower, class, ch, vez, s, opposition, blamed, him, for, unfairly, using, state, funds, to, spread, largesse, before, the, election, to, bolster, chavez, s, support, among, his, primary, electoral, base, the, lower, class, the, inauguration, of, ch, vez, s, new, term, was, scheduled, for, 10, january, 2013, but, as, he, was, undergoing, medical, treatment, at, the, time, in, cuba, he, was, not, able, to, return, to, venezuela, for, that, date, the, national, assembly, president, diosdado, cabello, proposed, to, postpone, the, inauguration, and, the, supreme, court, decided, that, being, just, another, term, of, the, sitting, president, and, not, the, inauguration, of, a, new, one, the, formality, could, be, bypassed, the, venezuelan, bishops, conference, opposed, the, verdict, stating, that, the, constitution, must, be, respected, and, the, venezuelan, government, had, not, been, transparent, regarding, details, about, ch, vez, s, health, acting, executive, officials, produced, orders, of, government, signed, by, ch, vez, which, were, suspected, of, forgery, by, some, opposition, politicians, who, claimed, that, ch, vez, was, too, sick, to, be, in, control, of, his, faculties, guillermo, cochez, recently, dismissed, from, the, office, of, panamanian, ambassador, to, the, organization, of, american, states, even, claimed, that, ch, vez, had, been, brain, dead, since, 31, december, 2012, due, to, the, death, of, ch, vez, vice, president, nicol, s, maduro, took, over, the, presidential, powers, and, duties, for, the, remainder, of, ch, vez, s, abbreviated, term, until, presidential, elections, were, held, venezuela, s, constitution, specifies, that, the, speaker, of, the, national, assembly, diosdado, cabello, should, assume, the, interim, presidency, if, a, president, cannot, be, sworn, in, maduro, remains, in, power, as, president, as, of, 2024, ch, vez, was, described, as, a, leftist, with, one, journal, stating, that, he, was, billed, as, the, hemisphere, s, second, leftist, leader, after, cuba, s, fidel, castro, in, a, 1996, interview, ch, vez, stated, i, am, not, marxist, but, i, am, not, anti, marxist, i, am, not, communist, but, i, am, not, anti, communist, in, 1999, ch, vez, told, the, new, york, times, that, if, you, are, attempting, to, determine, whether, chavez, is, of, the, left, right, or, center, if, he, is, socialist, communist, or, capitalist, well, i, am, none, of, those, but, i, have, a, bit, of, all, of, those, in, a, 1998, interview, ch, vez, stated, that, i, am, not, a, socialist, i, believe, that, today, s, world, latin, america, and, the, world, to, come, require, a, leap, forward, we, are, going, beyond, socialism, and, even, savage, capitalism, democracy, is, impossible, in, a, capitalist, system, capitalism, is, the, realm, of, injustice, and, a, tyranny, of, the, richest, against, the, poorest, rousseau, said, between, the, powerful, and, the, weak, all, freedom, is, oppressed, only, the, rule, of, law, sets, you, free, that, s, why, the, only, way, to, save, the, world, is, through, socialism, a, democratic, socialism, it, s, much, more, than, that, it, s, a, way, of, life, it, s, giving, power, to, the, people, it, is, not, the, government, of, the, rich, over, the, people, which, is, what, s, happening, in, almost, all, the, so, called, democratic, western, capitalist, countries, hugo, ch, vez, june, 2010, both, before, and, during, his, presidency, ch, vez, spoke, out, against, savage, capitalism, neoliberal, capitalism, and, simply, capitalism, in, various, speeches, during, his, first, electoral, campaign, as, noted, by, one, observer, ch, vez, made, clear, his, rejection, of, what, he, called, savage, capitalism, using, the, words, of, pope, john, paul, ii, ch, vez, wanted, greater, state, intervention, in, the, economy, but, built, bridges, to, the, private, sector, to, promote, the, development, of, national, industry, according, to, eduardo, semtei, a, political, scientist, considered, close, to, the, ideas, of, chavez, from, the, beginning, he, had, the, idea, that, the, classic, capitalist, model, is, a, model, contrary, to, the, development, of, society, in, 1999, ch, vez, argued, that, a, new, constitution, drafted, by, an, assembly, packed, with, his, allies, would, distance, venezuela, from, savage, capitalism, he, reiterated, this, position, on, 28, september, 2001, when, chavez, spoke, negatively, of, neoliberal, capitalism, and, the, economic, measures, of, the, carlos, andr, s, p, rez, el, gran, viraje, one, of, the, causes, of, the, caracazo, riots, in, various, interviews, conducted, in, 2002, ch, vez, shared, his, views, on, capitalism, saying, that, the, bolivarian, revolution, was, an, alternative, to, neoliberalism, saying, that, capitalism, was, sown, in, the, marrow, of, venezuela, and, the, rest, of, the, world, stating, that, his, revolution, and, its, missions, were, more, humane, ultimately, ch, vez, said, that, the, bolivarian, revolution, was, an, alternative, economy, to, dehumanized, capitalism, in, 2003, ch, vez, argued, that, the, soviet, union, disappeared, when, it, failed, in, its, efforts, to, dismantle, the, devastating, logic, of, capital, stating, that, it, is, the, alternative, model, that, he, promoted, was, the, one, now, confronting, neoliberalism, and, savage, capitalism, while, at, the, world, social, forum, on, 26, january, 2003, ch, vez, criticized, the, idea, that, capitalism, and, neoliberalism, won, following, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, saying, that, some, individuals, raised, the, thesis, of, single, thinking, there, are, no, more, alternatives, socialism, is, over, and, communism, is, over, and, long, live, neoliberal, capitalism, and, all, this, fairy, tale, ch, vez, noted, in, a, 2005, interview, that, at, one, time, i, came, to, think, about, the, third, way, i, was, having, trouble, interpreting, the, world, i, was, confused, i, spoke, and, wrote, a, lot, about, human, capitalism, today, i, am, convinced, that, it, is, impossible, i, became, convinced, that, socialism, is, the, way, ch, vez, arguably, did, not, fully, talk, openly, about, the, socialism, of, the, 21st, century, until, 3, december, 2006, during, a, speech, after, his, reelection, in, the, 2006, presidential, elections, ch, vez, s, connection, to, marxism, was, a, complex, one, though, he, had, described, himself, as, a, marxist, on, some, occasions, in, may, 1996, he, gave, an, interview, with, agust, n, blanco, mu, oz, in, which, he, remarked, i, am, not, a, marxist, but, i, am, not, anti, marxist, i, am, not, communist, but, i, am, not, anti, communist, in, a, 2009, speech, to, the, national, assembly, he, said, i, am, a, marxist, to, the, same, degree, as, the, followers, of, the, ideas, of, jesus, christ, and, the, liberator, of, america, sim, n, bol, var, he, was, well, versed, in, many, marxist, texts, having, read, the, works, of, many, marxist, theoreticians, and, often, publicly, quoted, them, various, international, marxists, supported, his, government, believing, it, to, be, a, sign, of, proletariat, revolution, as, predicted, in, marxist, theory, in, 2010, hugo, ch, vez, proclaimed, support, for, the, ideas, of, marxist, leon, trotsky, saying, when, i, called, him, former, minister, of, labour, jos, ram, n, rivero, ch, vez, explained, he, said, to, me, president, i, want, to, tell, you, something, before, someone, else, tells, you, i, am, a, trotskyist, and, i, said, well, what, is, the, problem, i, am, also, a, trotskyist, i, follow, trotsky, s, line, that, of, permanent, revolution, and, then, cited, marx, and, lenin, ch, vez, also, noted, his, identification, with, socialism, noting, that, the, constitution, speaks, that, the, socioeconomic, regime, of, venezuela, must, have, a, strong, cooperative, and, associative, content, and, that, gives, it, a, charge, that, breaks, with, individualism, and, neoliberalism, which, gives, a, strong, socialist, content, to, the, project, in, that, direction, we, have, to, go, all, out, to, cooperate, is, to, socialize, the, economy, to, give, it, a, social, content, i, am, sure, that, in, puerto, cruz, agricultural, cooperatives, will, emerge, later, in, his, presidency, ch, vez, promoted, the, socialism, of, the, 21st, century, his, approach, was, more, heavily, influenced, by, the, theories, of, istv, n, m, sz, ros, michael, lebowitz, and, marta, harnecker, who, was, ch, vez, s, adviser, between, 2004, and, 2011, rather, than, by, those, of, heinz, dieterich, hugo, ch, vez, defined, his, political, position, as, bolivarianism, an, ideology, he, developed, from, that, of, sim, n, bol, var, 1783, 1830, and, others, bol, var, was, a, 19th, century, general, who, led, the, fight, against, the, colonialist, spanish, authorities, and, who, is, widely, revered, across, latin, america, today, along, with, bol, var, the, other, two, primary, influences, upon, bolivarianism, are, sim, n, rodr, guez, 1769, 1854, a, philosopher, who, was, bol, var, s, tutor, and, mentor, and, ezequiel, zamora, 1817, 1860, the, venezuelan, federalist, general, the, fact, that, ch, vez, s, ideology, originated, from, bol, var, has, also, received, some, criticism, because, ch, vez, had, occasionally, described, himself, as, being, influenced, by, karl, marx, a, critic, of, bol, var, beddow, and, thibodeaux, noted, the, complications, between, bol, var, and, marx, stating, that, escribing, bolivar, as, a, socialist, warrior, in, the, class, struggle, when, he, was, actually, member, of, the, aristocratic, criollos, is, peculiar, when, considering, karl, marx, s, own, writings, on, bolivar, whom, he, dismissed, as, a, false, liberator, who, merely, sought, to, preserve, the, power, of, the, old, creole, nobility, which, he, belonged, ch, vez, s, early, heroes, were, nationalist, military, dictators, that, included, former, peruvian, president, juan, velasco, alvarado, and, former, panamanian, maximum, leader, omar, torrijos, one, dictator, ch, vez, admired, was, marcos, p, rez, jim, nez, a, former, president, of, venezuela, that, he, praised, for, the, public, works, he, performed, ch, vez, praised, p, rez, jim, nez, in, order, to, vilify, preceding, democratic, governments, stating, that, general, p, rez, jim, nez, was, the, best, president, venezuela, had, in, a, long, time, he, was, much, better, than, r, mulo, betancourt, much, better, than, all, of, those, others, they, hated, him, because, he, was, a, soldier, ch, vez, was, also, well, acquainted, with, the, various, traditions, of, latin, american, socialism, espoused, by, such, figures, as, colombian, politician, jorge, eli, cer, gait, n, and, former, chilean, president, salvador, allende, early, in, his, presidency, ch, vez, was, advised, and, influenced, by, the, argentine, peronist, norberto, ceresole, cuban, communist, revolutionaries, che, guevara, and, fidel, castro, also, influenced, ch, vez, especially, with, castro, s, government, assistance, with, the, bolivarian, missions, ch, vez, also, spoke, admiringly, of, mahatma, gandhi, stating, in, a, 2005, speech, stating, we, must, remember, that, thought, of, gandhi, that, reflects, a, deep, respect, for, himself, for, his, own, country, for, a, healthy, nationalism, and, expressed, support, for, what, he, said, was, gandhi, s, espousal, of, being, anti, capitalist, anti, colonialist, and, anti, imperialist, during, the, same, speech, ch, vez, also, expressed, influence, from, jawaharlal, nehru, noting, he, was, a, main, figure, of, the, non, aligned, movement, with, ch, vez, citing, his, leadership, as, an, inspiration, of, the, need, of, brotherhood, and, solidarity, among, the, peoples, of, the, third, world, the, need, to, unite, to, defend, the, interests, of, our, people, of, poor, people, against, the, abuse, of, rich, people, other, indirect, influences, on, ch, vez, s, political, philosophy, are, the, gospel, teachings, of, jesus, christ, other, inspirations, of, ch, vez, s, political, view, are, giuseppe, garibaldi, antonio, gramsci, and, antonio, negri, in, september, 2006, ch, vez, said, 9, 11, conspiracy, theories, were, not, absurd, and, that, a, building, never, collapses, like, that, unless, it, s, with, an, implosion, ch, vez, also, told, christopher, hitchens, that, he, did, not, believe, that, the, footage, of, the, apollo, 11, moon, landings, was, genuine, the, red, line, represents, trends, of, annual, rates, given, throughout, the, period, shown, from, his, election, in, 1998, until, his, death, in, march, 2013, ch, vez, s, administration, proposed, and, enacted, populist, economic, policies, the, social, programs, were, designed, to, be, short, term, though, after, seeing, political, success, as, their, result, ch, vez, made, the, efforts, central, to, his, administration, and, often, overspent, outside, of, venezuela, s, budget, due, to, increasing, oil, prices, in, the, early, 2000s, which, raised, funds, not, seen, in, venezuela, since, the, 1980s, ch, vez, created, the, bolivarian, missions, aimed, at, providing, public, services, to, improve, economic, cultural, and, social, conditions, using, these, populist, policies, in, order, to, maintain, political, power, according, to, corrales, and, penfold, aid, was, disbursed, to, some, of, the, poor, and, more, gravely, in, a, way, that, ended, up, helping, the, president, and, his, allies, and, cronies, more, than, anyone, else, the, missions, which, were, directly, overseen, by, ch, vez, and, often, linked, to, his, political, campaigns, entailed, the, construction, of, thousands, of, free, medical, clinics, for, the, poor, and, the, enactment, of, food, and, housing, subsidies, the, quality, of, life, of, venezuelans, had, also, improved, temporarily, according, to, a, un, index, teresa, a, meade, wrote, that, ch, vez, s, popularity, strongly, depended, on, the, lower, classes, who, have, benefited, from, these, health, initiatives, and, similar, policies, following, elections, social, programs, saw, less, attention, from, the, government, and, their, overall, effectiveness, decreased, the, gini, coefficient, a, measure, of, income, inequality, dropped, from, 495, in, 1998, to, 39, in, 2011, putting, venezuela, behind, only, canada, in, the, western, hemisphere, 95, of, venezuelans, aged, 15, and, older, could, also, read, and, write, though, some, scholars, have, disputed, the, claim, that, literacy, improvements, during, chavez, s, presidency, resulted, from, his, administration, s, policies, the, poverty, rate, fell, from, 48, 6, in, 1999, to, 32, 1, in, 2013, according, to, the, venezuelan, government, s, national, statistics, institute, ine, the, drop, of, venezuela, s, poverty, rate, compared, to, poverty, in, other, south, american, countries, was, slightly, behind, that, of, peru, brazil, and, panama, with, the, poverty, rate, becoming, higher, than, the, latin, american, average, in, 2013, according, to, the, un, in, the, two, years, following, ch, vez, s, death, the, poverty, rate, returned, to, where, it, had, been, before, his, presidency, with, a, 2017, nacla, analysis, stating, that, reductions, in, poverty, and, inequality, during, the, ch, vez, years, were, real, but, somewhat, superficial, structural, poverty, and, inequality, such, as, the, quality, of, housing, neighborhoods, education, and, employment, remained, largely, unchanged, ch, vez, s, populist, policies, eventually, led, to, a, severe, socioeconomic, crisis, in, venezuela, the, social, works, initiated, by, ch, vez, s, government, relied, on, oil, products, the, keystone, of, the, venezuelan, economy, with, ch, vez, s, administration, suffering, from, dutch, disease, as, a, result, in, 2012, the, world, bank, also, explained, that, venezuela, s, economy, was, extremely, vulnerable, to, changes, in, oil, prices, since, in, 2012, 96, of, the, country, s, exports, and, nearly, half, of, its, fiscal, revenue, relied, on, oil, production, while, by, 2008, according, to, foreign, policy, exports, of, everything, but, oil, collapsed, the, ch, vez, administration, then, spent, governmental, proceeds, from, the, high, oil, prices, on, his, populist, policies, to, gain, the, approval, of, voters, economists, say, that, the, venezuelan, government, s, overspending, on, social, programs, and, strict, business, policies, caused, to, imbalances, in, the, country, s, economy, contributing, to, rising, inflation, poverty, low, healthcare, spending, and, shortages, in, venezuela, going, into, the, final, years, of, his, presidency, such, occurrences, especially, the, risk, of, default, and, the, unfriendliness, toward, private, businesses, led, to, a, lack, of, foreign, investment, and, stronger, foreign, currencies, though, the, venezuelan, government, argued, that, the, private, sector, had, remained, relatively, unchanged, during, chavez, s, presidency, despite, several, nationalizations, in, january, 2013, near, the, end, of, ch, vez, s, presidency, the, heritage, foundation, and, the, wall, street, journal, gave, venezuela, s, economic, freedom, a, score, of, 36, 1, down, from, 56, 1, in, 1999, ranking, its, freedom, very, low, at, 174th, of, 177, countries, with, freedom, on, a, downward, trend, according, to, some, analysts, the, economic, problems, venezuela, has, suffered, under, president, nicol, s, maduro, would, likely, have, emerged, even, if, ch, vez, had, remained, president, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, health, and, nutrition, indexes, in, venezuela, were, generally, low, and, social, inequality, in, access, to, nutrition, was, high, ch, vez, made, it, his, stated, goal, to, lower, inequality, in, access, to, basic, nutrition, and, to, achieve, food, sovereignty, for, venezuela, the, main, strategy, for, making, food, available, to, all, economic, classes, was, the, controversial, policy, of, creating, fixed, price, ceilings, for, basic, staple, foods, which, was, implemented, in, 2003, between, 1998, and, 2006, malnutrition, related, deaths, fell, by, 50, ch, vez, also, expropriated, and, redistributed, 5, million, acres, of, farmland, from, large, landowners, price, controls, initiated, by, ch, vez, created, product, shortages, since, merchants, could, no, longer, afford, to, import, necessary, goods, ch, vez, blamed, speculators, and, hoarders, for, these, scarcities, and, strictly, enforced, his, price, control, policy, denouncing, anyone, who, sold, food, products, for, higher, prices, in, 2011, food, prices, in, caracas, were, nine, times, higher, than, when, the, price, controls, were, put, in, place, and, resulted, in, shortages, of, cooking, oil, chicken, powdered, milk, cheese, sugar, and, meat, the, price, controls, increased, the, demand, for, basic, foods, while, making, it, difficult, for, venezuela, to, import, goods, causing, increased, reliance, on, domestic, production, economists, believe, this, policy, increased, shortages, shortages, of, food, then, occurred, throughout, the, rest, of, ch, vez, s, presidency, with, food, shortage, rates, between, 10, and, 20, from, 2010, to, 2013, one, possible, reason, for, shortages, is, the, relationship, between, inflation, and, subsidies, where, a, lack, profitability, due, to, price, regulations, affects, operations, in, turn, the, lack, of, dollars, made, it, difficult, to, purchase, more, food, imports, ch, vez, s, strategy, in, response, to, food, shortages, consisted, of, attempting, to, increase, domestic, production, through, nationalizing, large, parts, of, the, food, industry, though, such, nationalizations, allegedly, did, the, opposite, and, caused, decreased, production, instead, as, part, of, his, strategy, of, food, security, ch, vez, started, a, national, chain, of, supermarkets, the, mercal, network, which, had, 16, 600, outlets, and, 85, 000, employees, that, distributed, food, at, highly, discounted, prices, and, ran, 6, 000, soup, kitchens, throughout, the, country, simultaneously, ch, vez, expropriated, many, private, supermarkets, the, mercal, network, was, criticized, by, some, commentators, as, being, a, part, of, ch, vez, s, strategy, to, brand, himself, as, a, provider, of, cheap, food, and, the, shops, feature, his, picture, prominently, the, mercal, network, was, also, subject, to, frequent, shortages, of, basic, staples, such, as, meat, milk, and, sugar, and, when, scarce, products, arrived, shoppers, had, to, wait, in, lines, after, his, election, in, 1998, more, than, 100, 000, state, owned, cooperatives, which, claimed, to, represent, some, 1, 5, million, people, were, formed, with, the, assistance, of, government, start, up, credit, and, technical, training, the, venezuelan, government, often, failed, to, construct, the, number, of, homes, they, had, proposed, according, to, venezuela, s, el, universal, one, of, the, ch, vez, administration, s, outstanding, failures, was, the, inability, to, meet, its, goals, of, constructing, housing, the, red, line, represents, what, the, venezuelan, government, officially, rates, the, hard, bol, var, sources, banco, central, de, venezuela, dolar, paralelo, federal, reserve, bank, international, monetary, fund, in, the, first, few, years, of, chavez, s, office, his, newly, created, social, programs, required, large, payments, in, order, to, make, the, desired, changes, on, 5, february, 2003, the, government, created, cadivi, a, currency, control, board, charged, with, handling, foreign, exchange, procedures, its, creation, was, to, control, capital, flight, by, placing, limits, on, individuals, and, only, offering, them, so, much, of, a, foreign, currency, this, limit, to, foreign, currency, led, to, a, creation, of, a, currency, black, market, economy, since, venezuelan, merchants, rely, on, foreign, goods, that, require, payments, with, reliable, foreign, currencies, as, venezuela, printed, more, money, for, their, social, programs, the, bol, var, continued, to, devalue, for, venezuelan, citizens, and, merchants, since, the, government, held, the, majority, of, the, more, reliable, currencies, the, implied, value, or, black, market, value, is, what, venezuelans, believe, the, hard, bol, var, is, worth, compared, to, the, united, states, dollar, the, high, rates, in, the, black, market, make, it, difficult, for, businesses, to, purchase, necessary, goods, since, the, government, often, forces, these, businesses, to, make, price, cuts, this, leads, to, businesses, selling, their, goods, and, making, a, low, profit, since, businesses, make, low, profits, this, leads, to, shortages, since, they, are, unable, to, import, the, goods, that, venezuela, is, reliant, on, chavez, used, exchange, rate, subsidies, to, underwrite, imports, this, policy, was, not, welfare, maximizing, but, rather, benefited, special, interests, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, there, was, a, steady, increase, in, crime, in, latin, america, the, countries, of, colombia, el, salvador, venezuela, and, brazil, all, had, homicide, rates, above, the, regional, average, during, ch, vez, s, terms, as, president, hundreds, of, thousands, of, venezuelans, were, murdered, due, to, violent, crimes, occurring, in, the, country, gareth, a, jones, and, dennis, rodgers, stated, in, their, book, youth, violence, in, latin, america, gangs, and, juvenile, justice, in, perspective, that, with, the, change, of, political, regime, in, 1999, and, the, initiation, of, the, bolivarian, revolution, a, period, of, transformation, and, political, conflict, began, marked, by, a, further, increase, in, the, number, and, rate, of, violent, deaths, showing, that, in, four, years, the, murder, rate, had, increased, to, 44, per, 100, 000, people, kidnappings, also, rose, tremendously, during, ch, vez, s, tenure, with, the, number, of, kidnappings, over, 20, times, higher, in, 2011, than, when, chavez, was, elected, documentary, filmmaker, james, brabazon, stated, kidnapping, crimes, had, skyrocketed, after, late, venezuelan, president, hugo, chavez, freed, thousands, of, violent, prisoners, as, part, of, controversial, criminal, justice, system, reforms, while, kidnappings, and, murders, also, increased, due, to, colombian, organized, crime, activity, as, well, he, further, explained, that, common, criminals, felt, that, the, venezuelan, government, did, not, care, for, the, problems, of, the, higher, and, middle, classes, which, in, turn, gave, them, a, sense, of, impunity, that, created, a, large, business, of, kidnapping, for, ransom, under, ch, vez, s, administration, crimes, were, so, prevalent, that, by, 2007, the, government, no, longer, produced, crime, data, homicide, rates, in, venezuela, more, than, tripled, with, one, ngo, finding, the, rate, to, have, nearly, quadrupled, the, majority, of, the, deaths, occur, in, crowded, slums, in, caracas, the, ngo, found, that, the, number, of, homicides, in, the, country, increased, from, 6, 000, in, 1999, to, 24, 763, in, 2013, in, 2010, caracas, had, the, highest, murder, rate, in, the, world, having, more, deaths, than, baghdad, during, the, iraq, war, according, to, the, united, nations, office, on, drugs, and, crime, in, 2012, there, were, 13, 080, murders, in, venezuela, in, leaked, government, ine, data, for, kidnappings, in, the, year, 2009, the, number, of, kidnappings, were, at, an, estimated, 16, 917, contrasting, the, cicpcs, number, of, only, 673, before, the, venezuelan, government, blocked, the, data, according, to, the, leaked, ine, report, only, 1, 332, investigations, for, kidnappings, were, opened, or, about, 7, of, the, total, kidnapping, cases, with, 90, of, the, kidnappings, happening, away, from, rural, areas, 80, of, all, being, express, kidnappings, and, the, most, common, victim, being, lower, middle, or, middle, class, venezuelans, and, middle, aged, men, also, in, 2009, it, was, reported, that, venezuelan, authorities, would, assign, judicial, police, to, caracas, area, morgues, to, speak, with, families, at, that, time, they, would, advise, families, not, to, report, the, murder, of, their, family, member, to, the, media, in, exchange, for, expediting, the, process, of, releasing, the, victim, s, body, in, september, 2010, responding, to, escalating, crime, rates, in, the, country, ch, vez, stated, that, venezuela, was, no, more, violent, than, it, was, when, he, first, took, office, an, international, crisis, group, report, that, same, year, stated, that, when, ch, vez, took, office, there, were, some, factors, beyond, his, control, that, led, to, the, crime, epidemic, throughout, venezuela, but, that, ch, vez, ignored, it, as, well, as, corruption, in, the, country, especially, among, fellow, state, officials, the, report, also, stated, that, international, organised, crime, filters, between, colombia, and, venezuela, with, assistance, from, the, highest, spheres, of, government, in, venezuela, leading, to, higher, rates, of, kidnapping, drug, trafficking, and, homicides, ch, vez, supporters, stated, that, the, bolivarian, national, police, had, reduced, crime, and, also, said, that, the, states, with, the, highest, murder, rates, were, controlled, by, the, opposition, during, ch, vez, s, presidency, there, were, reports, of, prisoners, having, easy, access, to, firearms, drugs, and, alcohol, carlos, nieto, head, of, window, to, freedom, alleged, that, heads, of, gangs, acquire, military, weapons, from, the, state, saying, they, have, the, types, of, weapons, that, can, only, be, obtained, by, the, country, s, armed, forces, no, one, else, has, these, use, of, internet, and, mobile, phones, were, also, commonplace, allowing, criminals, to, take, part, in, street, crime, while, in, prison, one, prisoner, explained, how, if, the, guards, mess, with, us, we, shoot, them, and, that, he, had, seen, a, man, have, his, head, cut, off, and, people, play, football, with, it, edgardo, lander, a, sociologist, and, professor, at, the, central, university, of, venezuela, with, a, phd, in, sociology, from, harvard, university, explained, that, venezuelan, prisons, were, practically, a, school, for, criminals, since, young, inmates, come, out, trained, and, hardened, compared, to, before, their, incarceration, he, also, explained, that, prisons, are, controlled, by, gangs, and, that, very, little, has, been, done, to, restrain, their, activities, the, electoral, processes, surrounding, venezuela, s, democracy, under, ch, vez, were, often, observed, controversially, according, to, bloomberg, he, changed, venezuela, from, a, democracy, to, a, largely, authoritarian, system, however, there, were, limits, to, his, authoritarianism, and, he, thought, of, the, electoral, system, as, a, key, way, to, make, himself, more, effective, as, a, leader, as, new, york, university, historian, greg, grandin, has, pointed, out, ch, vez, submitted, himself, and, his, agenda, to, 14, national, votes, winning, 13, of, them, by, large, margins, in, polling, deemed, by, jimmy, carter, to, be, best, in, the, world, francisco, toro, editor, of, caracas, chronicles, an, opposition, friendly, news, and, analysis, site, said, ch, vez, was, always, careful, to, maintain, electoral, legitimacy, toro, says, that, ch, vez, had, big, advantages, with, friendly, media, and, his, tendency, to, use, state, money, on, his, campaigns, but, that, he, didn, t, steal, or, cancel, elections, blatantly, ch, vez, even, allowed, his, opposition, to, run, a, recall, referendum, against, him, in, 2004, just, two, years, after, surviving, a, coup, attempt, he, won, the, referendum, by, a, huge, margin, since, 1998, elections, in, venezuela, have, been, automated, using, touch, screen, dre, voting, machines, which, provide, a, voter, verified, paper, audit, trail, and, administered, by, the, national, electoral, council, in, venezuela, voters, touch, a, computer, screen, to, cast, their, vote, and, then, receive, a, paper, receipt, which, they, verify, and, deposit, in, a, ballot, box, most, of, the, paper, ballots, are, compared, with, the, electronic, tally, this, system, makes, vote, rigging, nearly, impossible, to, steal, the, vote, would, require, hacking, the, computers, and, then, stuffing, the, ballot, boxes, to, match, the, rigged, vote, beginning, in, 2012, venezuela, s, elections, used, biometric, authentication, to, activate, the, voting, machine, in, december, 1998, hugo, ch, vez, declared, three, goals, for, the, new, government, convening, a, constituent, assembly, to, write, a, new, constitution, eliminating, government, corruption, and, fighting, against, social, exclusion, and, poverty, however, according, to, the, libertarian, cato, institute, during, hugo, ch, vez, s, time, in, power, corruption, has, become, widespread, throughout, the, government, due, to, impunity, towards, members, of, the, government, bribes, and, the, lack, of, transparency, in, 2004, hugo, ch, vez, and, his, allies, took, over, the, supreme, court, filling, it, with, supporters, of, ch, vez, and, made, new, measures, so, the, government, could, dismiss, justices, from, the, court, according, to, the, cato, institute, the, national, electoral, council, of, venezuela, was, under, control, of, ch, vez, where, he, tried, to, push, a, constitutional, reform, that, would, have, allowed, him, unlimited, opportunities, for, reelection, the, corruption, perceptions, index, produced, annually, by, the, berlin, based, ngo, transparency, international, tni, reported, that, in, the, later, years, of, ch, vez, s, tenure,
