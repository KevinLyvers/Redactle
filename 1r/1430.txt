of, economic, liberalism, the, evolution, of, his, regime, followed, the, path, begun, by, gheorghiu, dej, he, continued, with, the, program, of, intensive, industrialization, aimed, at, the,

to, 61, in, 1966, and, 49, by, 1971, however, for, romania, like, other, eastern, people, s, republics, industrialization, did, not, mean, a, total, social, break, with, the, countryside, the, peasants, returned, periodically, to, the, villages, or, resided, in, them, commuting, daily, to, the, city, in, a, practice, called, naveta, this, allowed, romanians, to, act, as, peasants, and, workers, at, the, same, time, universities, were, also, founded, in, small, romanian, towns, which, served, to, train, qualified, professionals, such, as, engineers, economists, planners, or, jurists, necessary, for, the, industrialization, and, development, project, of, the, country, romanian, healthcare, also, achieved, improvements, and, recognition, by, the, world, health, organization, who, in, may, 1969, marcolino, candau, director, general, of, this, organization, visited, romania, and, declared, that, the, visits, of, who, staff, to, various, romanian, hospital, establishments, had, made, an, extraordinarily, good, impression, the, social, and, economic, transformations, resulted, in, improved, living, conditions, for, romanians, economic, growth, allowed, for, higher, salaries, which, combined, with, the, benefits, offered, by, the, state, free, medical, care, pensions, free, universal, education, at, all, levels, etc, were, a, leap, compared, to, the, pre, wwii, situation, of, the, romanian, population, certain, extra, retributions, were, allowed, for, the, peasants, who, started, to, produce, more, in, 1966, in, an, attempt, to, boost, the, country, s, population, ceau, escu, made, abortion, illegal, and, introduced, decree, 770, in, order, to, reverse, the, romanian, population, s, low, birth, and, fertility, rates, mothers, of, at, least, five, children,

deficiencies, measures, to, encourage, reproduction, included, financial, motivations, for, families, who, bore, children, guaranteed, maternity, leave, and, childcare, support, for, mothers, who, returned, to, work, work, protection, for, women, and, extensive, access, to, medical, control, in, all, stages, of, pregnancy, as, well, as, after, it, medical, control, was, seen, as, one, of, the, most, productive, effects, of, the, law, since, all, women, who, became, pregnant, were, under, the, care, of, a, qualified, medical, practitioner, even, in, rural, areas, in, some, cases, if, a, woman, was, unable, to, visit, a, medical, office, a, doctor, would, visit, her, home, ceau, escu, s, speech, of, 21, august, 1968, represented, the, apogee, of, ceau, escu, s, rule, it, marked, the, highest, point, in, ceau, escu, s, popularity, when, he, openly, condemned, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, ceau, escu, visited, china, north, korea, mongolia, and, north, vietnam, in, 1971, he, took, great, interest, in, the, idea, of, total, national, transformation, as, embodied, in, the, programmes, of, north, korea, s, juche, and, china, s, cultural, revolution, he, was, also, inspired, by, the, personality, cults, of, north, korea, s, kim, il, sung, and, china, s, mao, zedong, journalist, edward, behr, claimed, that, ceau, escu, admired, both, mao, and, kim, as, leaders, who, not, only, totally, dominated, their, nations, but, had, also, used, totalitarian, methods, coupled, with, significant, ultra, nationalism, mixed, in, with, communism, in, order, to, transform, both, china, and, north, korea, into, major, world, powers, furthermore, that, kim, and, even, more, so, mao, had, broken, free, of, soviet, control, were, additional, sources, of, admiration, for, ceau, escu, according, to, british, journalist, edward, behr, elena, ceau, escu, allegedly, bonded, with, mao, s, wife, jiang, qing, behr, wrote, that, the, possibility, that, what, ceau, escu, had, seen, in, both, china, and, north, korea, were, vast, potemkin, villages, for, the, hoodwinking, of, gullible, foreign, guests, was, something, that, never, seemed, to, have, crossed, his, mind, shortly, after, returning, home, he, began, to, emulate, north, korea, s, system, north, korean, books, on, juche, were, translated, into, romanian, and, widely, distributed, inside, the, country, on, 6, july, 1971, he, delivered, a, speech, before, the, executive, committee, of, the, romanian, communist, party, this, quasi, maoist, speech, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, july, theses, contained, seventeen, proposals, among, these, were, continuous, growth, in, the, leading, role, of, the, party, improvement, of, party, education, and, of, mass, political, action, youth, participation, on, large, construction, projects, as, part, of, their, patriotic, work, an, intensification, of, political, ideological, education, in, schools, and, universities, as, well, as, in, children, s, youth, and, student, organizations, and, an, expansion, of, political, propaganda, orienting, radio, and, television, shows, to, this, end, as, well, as, publishing, houses, theatres, and, cinemas, opera, ballet, artists, unions, promoting, a, militant, revolutionary, character, in, artistic, productions, the, liberalization, of, 1965, was, condemned, and, an, index, of, banned, books, and, authors, was, re, established, the, theses, heralded, the, beginning, of, a, mini, cultural, revolution, in, romania, launching, a, neo, stalinist, offensive, against, cultural, autonomy, reaffirming, an, ideological, basis, for, literature, that, in, theory, the, party, had, hardly, abandoned, although, presented, in, terms, of, socialist, humanism, the, theses, in, fact, marked, a, return, to, the, strict, guidelines, of, socialist, realism, and, attacks, on, non, compliant, intellectuals, strict, ideological, conformity, in, the, humanities, and, social, sciences, was, demanded, in, a, 1972, speech, ceau, escu, stated, he, wanted, a, certain, blending, of, party, and, state, activities, in, the, long, run, we, shall, witness, an, ever, closer, blending, of, the, activities, of, the, party, state, and, other, social, bodies, in, practice, a, number, of, joint, party, state, organizations, were, founded, such, as, the, council, for, socialist, education, and, culture, which, had, no, precise, counterpart, in, any, of, the, other, communist, states, of, eastern, europe, and, the, romanian, communist, party, was, embedded, into, the, daily, life, of, the, nation, in, a, way, that, it, never, had, been, before, in, 1974, the, party, programme, of, the, romanian, communist, party, announced, that, structural, changes, in, society, were, insufficient, to, create, a, full, socialist, consciousness, in, the, people, and, that, a, full, socialist, consciousness, could, only, come, about, if, the, entire, population, was, made, aware, of, socialist, values, that, guided, society, the, communist, party, was, to, be, the, agency, that, would, so, enlighten, the, population, and, in, the, words, of, the, british, historian, richard, crampton, the, party, would, merge, state, and, society, the, individual, and, the, collective, and, would, promote, the, ever, more, organic, participation, of, party, members, in, the, entire, social, life, in, 1974, ceau, escu, converted, his, post, of, president, of, the, state, council, to, a, full, fledged, executive, presidency, he, was, first, elected, to, this, post, in, 1974, and, would, be, reelected, every, five, years, until, 1989, although, ceau, escu, had, been, nominal, head, of, state, since, 1967, he, had, merely, been, first, among, equals, on, the, state, council, deriving, his, real, power, from, his, status, as, party, leader, the, new, post, however, made, him, the, nation, s, top, decision, maker, both, in, name, and, in, fact, he, was, empowered, to, carry, out, those, functions, of, the, state, council, that, did, not, require, plenums, he, also, appointed, and, dismissed, the, president, of, the, supreme, court, and, the, prosecutor, general, whenever, the, legislature, was, not, in, session, in, practice, from, 1974, onward, ceau, escu, frequently, ruled, by, decree, over, time, he, usurped, many, powers, and, functions, that, nominally, were, vested, in, the, state, council, as, a, whole, effectively, ceau, escu, now, held, all, governing, power, in, the, nation, virtually, all, party, and, state, institutions, were, subordinated, to, his, will, the, principles, of, democratic, centralism, combined, with, the, legislature, s, infrequent, sessions, it, sat, in, full, session, only, twice, a, year, meant, that, for, all, intents, and, purposes, his, decisions, had, the, force, of, law, starting, with, the, 1973, 74, arab, oil, embargo, against, the, west, a, period, of, prolonged, high, oil, prices, set, in, that, characterised, the, rest, of, the, 1970s, romania, as, a, major, oil, equipment, producer, greatly, benefited, from, the, high, oil, prices, of, the, 1970s, which, led, ceau, escu, to, embark, on, an, ambitious, plan, to, invest, heavily, in, oil, refining, plants, ceau, escu, s, plan, was, to, make, romania, into, europe, s, number, one, oil, refiner, not, only, of, its, own, oil, but, also, of, oil, from, middle, eastern, states, such, as, iraq, and, iran, and, then, to, sell, all, of, the, refined, oil, at, a, profit, on, the, rotterdam, spot, market, as, romania, lacked, the, money, to, build, the, necessary, oil, refining, plants, and, ceau, escu, chose, to, spend, the, windfall, from, the, high, oil, prices, on, aid, to, the, third, world, in, an, attempt, to, buy, romania, international, influence, ceau, escu, borrowed, heavily, from, western, banks, on, the, assumption, that, when, the, loans, came, due, the, profits, from, the, sales, of, the, refined, oil, would, be, more, than, enough, to, pay, off, the, loans, the, 1977, earthquake, which, destroyed, much, of, bucharest, led, to, delays, in, the, oil, plan, by, the, time, the, oil, refining, plants, were, finished, in, the, early, 1980s, a, slump, in, oil, prices, had, set, in, leading, to, major, financial, problems, for, romania, in, august, 1977, over, 30, 000, miners, went, on, strike, in, the, jiu, river, valley, complaining, of, low, pay, and, poor, working, conditions, the, jiu, valley, miners, strike, was, the, most, significant, expression, of, opposition, to, ceau, escu, s, rule, prior, to, the, late, 1980s, the, striking, miners, were, inspired, by, similar, strikes, along, poland, s, baltic, coast, in, december, 1970, and, just, as, in, poland, in, 1970, the, striking, romanian, miners, demanded, face, to, face, negotiations, with, their, nation, s, leader, when, ceau, escu, appeared, before, the, miners, on, the, third, day, of, the, strike, he, was, greeted, in, the, words, of, the, british, historian, richard, crampton, once, again, la, polonaise, with, cries, of, down, with, the, red, bourgeoisie, ceau, escu, ultimately, negotiated, a, compromise, solution, to, the, strike, in, the, years, after, the, strike, a, number, of, its, leaders, died, of, accidents, and, premature, disease, rumors, emerged, that, securitate, had, doctors, give, the, strike, leaders, 5, minute, chest, x, rays, to, ensure, the, development, of, cancer, he, continued, to, follow, an, independent, policy, in, foreign, relations, for, example, in, 1984, romania, was, one, of, few, communist, states, notably, including, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, yugoslavia, to, take, part, in, the, 1984, summer, olympics, in, los, angeles, despite, a, soviet, led, boycott, also, the, socialist, republic, of, romania, was, the, first, of, the, eastern, bloc, nations, to, have, official, relations, with, the, western, bloc, and, the, european, community, an, agreement, including, romania, in, the, community, s, generalised, system, of, preferences, was, signed, in, 1974, and, an, agreement, on, industrial, products, was, signed, in, 1980, on, 4, april, 1975, ceau, escu, visited, japan, and, met, with, emperor, hirohito, in, june, 1978, ceau, escu, made, a, state, visit, to, the, uk, where, a, 200m, licensing, agreement, was, signed, between, the, romanian, government, and, british, aerospace, for, the, production, of, more, than, eighty, bac, one, eleven, aircraft, the, deal, was, said, at, the, time, to, be, the, biggest, between, two, countries, involving, a, civil, aircraft, this, was, the, first, state, visit, by, a, communist, head, of, state, to, the, uk, and, ceau, escu, was, given, a, knighthood, by, the, queen, which, was, revoked, on, the, day, before, his, death, in, 1989, similarly, in, 1983, vice, president, of, the, united, states, george, h, w, bush, and, in, 1985, united, states, secretary, of, state, george, shultz, also, praised, the, romanian,

highest, ranking, defector, from, the, eastern, bloc, during, the, cold, war, his, defection, was, a, powerful, blow, against, the, administration, forcing, ceau, escu, to, overhaul, romania, s,

activities, such, as, massive, spying, on, american, industry, and, elaborate, efforts, to, rally, western, political, support, systematization, romanian, sistematizarea, was, the, program, of, urban, planning, carried, out, under, ceau, escu, s, regime, after, a, visit, to, north, korea, in, 1971, ceau, escu, was, impressed, by, the, juche, ideology, of, that, country, and, began, a, major, campaign, shortly, afterwards, beginning, in, 1974, systematization, consisted, largely, of, the, demolition, and, reconstruction, of, existing, villages, towns, and, cities, in, whole, or, in, part, with, the, stated, goal, of, turning, romania, into, a, multilaterally, developed, socialist, society, the, policy, largely, consisted, in, the, mass, construction, of, high, density, blocks, of, flats, blocuri, during, the, 1980s, ceau, escu, became, obsessed, with, building, himself, a, palace, of, unprecedented, proportions, along, with, an, equally, grandiose, neighborhood, centrul, civic, to, accompany, it, the, mass, demolitions, that, occurred, in, the, 1980s, under, which, an, overall, area, of, eight, square, kilometres, of, the, historic, center, of, bucharest, were, leveled, including, monasteries, churches, synagogues, a, hospital, and, a, noted, art, deco, sports, stadium, in, order, to, make, way, for, the, grandiose, centrul, civic, civic, center, and, the, house, of, the, republic, now, officially, renamed, the, palace, of, parliament, were, the, most, extreme, manifestation, of, the, systematization, policy, in, 1988, massive, rural, resettlement, program, began, ceau, escu, s, political, independence, from, the, soviet, union, and, his, protest, against, the, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, in, 1968, drew, the, interest, of, western, powers, whose, governments, briefly, believed, that, he, was, an, anti, soviet, maverick, and, hoped, to, create, a, schism, in, the, warsaw, pact, by, funding, him, ceau, escu, did, not, realise, that, the, funding, was, not, always, favorable, ceau, escu, was, able, to, borrow, heavily, more, than, 13, billion, from, the, west, to, finance, economic, development, programs, but, these, loans, ultimately, devastated, the, country, s, finances, he, also, secured, a, deal, for, cheap, oil, from, iran, but, the, deal, fell, through, after, the, shah, was, overthrown, in, an, attempt, to, correct, this, ceau, escu, decided, to, repay, romania, s, foreign, debts, he, organised, the, 1986, military, referendum, and, managed, to, change, the, constitution, adding, a, clause, that, barred, romania, from, taking, foreign, loans, in, the, future, according, to, official, results, the, referendum, yielded, a, nearly, unanimous, yes, vote, romania, s, record, having, all, of, its, debts, to, commercial, banks, paid, off, in, full, has, not, been, matched, by, any, other, heavily, indebted, country, in, the, world, the, policy, to, repay, and, in, multiple, cases, prepay, romania, s, external, debt, became, the, dominant, policy, in, the, late, 1980s, the, result, was, economic, stagnation, throughout, the, 1980s, and, towards, the, end, of, the, decade, an, economic, crisis, the, country, s, industrial, capacity, was, eroded, as, equipment, grew, obsolete, and, energy, intensity, increased, and, the, standard, of, living, deteriorated, significantly, draconian, restrictions, were, imposed, on,

by, 0, 5, mostly, due, to, a, decline, in, industrial, output, caused, by, significantly, increased, material, costs, despite, the, 1988, decline, the, net, foreign, balance, reached, its, decade, long, peak, 9, 5, of, gdp, in, 1989, gdp, slumped, by, a, further, 5, 8, due, to, growing, shortages, and, the, increasingly, obsolete, capital, stock, by, march, 1989, virtually, all, external, debt, had, been, repaid, including, all, medium, and, long, term, external, debt, the, remaining, amount, totalling, less, than, 1, million, consisted, of, short, term, credits, mainly, short, term, export,

instead, romanian, workers, began, to, mobilize, against, the, economic, policies, of, ceau, escu, spontaneous, labor, conflicts, limited, in, scale, took, place, in, major, industrial, centers, such, as, cluj, napoca, november, 1986, and, the, nicolina, platform, in, ia, i, february, 1987, culminating, in, a, massive, strike, in, bra, ov, the, draconian, measures, taken, by, ceau, escu, involved, reducing, energy, and, food, consumption, as, well, as, lowering, workers, incomes, leading, to, what, political, scientist, vladimir, tism, neanu, called, generalized, dissatisfaction, over, 20, 000, workers, and, a, number, of, townspeople, marched, against, economic, policies, in, socialist, romania, and, nicolae, ceau, escu, s, policies, of, rationing, of, basic, foodstuffs, rationing, electricity, and, central, heating, the, first, protests, began, practically, on, 14, november, 1987, at, the, 440, molds, section, of, the, red, flag, truck, company, initially, the, protests, were, for, basic, needs, we, want, food, and, heating, we, want, our, money, we, want, food, for, the, children, we, want, light, and, heat, and, we, want, bread, without, a, card, next, to, the, county, hospital, they, sang, the, anthem, of, the, revolution, of, 1848, de, teapt, te, rom, ne, upon, arriving, in, the, city, center, thousands, of, workers, from, the, tractorul, bra, ov, and, hidromecanica, factories, pupils, students, and, others, joined, the, demonstration, from, this, moment, on, the, protest, became, political, participants, later, claimed, to, have, chanted, slogans, such, as, down, with, ceau, escu, down, with, communism, down, with, the, dictatorship, or, down, with, the, tyrant, during, the, march, members, of, the, securitate, disguised, as, workers, infiltrated, the, demonstrators, or, remained, on, the, sidelines, as, spectators, photographing, or, even, filming, by, dusk, securitate, forces, and, the, military, surrounded, the, city, center, and, disbanded, the, revolt, by, force, some, 300, protesters, were, arrested, and, in, order, to, hide, the, political, nature, of, the, bra, ov, uprising, tried, for, disturbing, the, peace, and, outrage, against, morals, those, under, investigation, were, beaten, and, tortured, 61, receiving, sentences, ranging, from, 6, months, to, 3, years, in, prison, including, sentences, to, be, carried, out, working, at, various, state, enterprises, across, in, the, country, although, many, previous, party, meetings, had, called, for, the, death, penalty, to, set, an, example, the, regime, was, eager, to, downplay, the, uprising, as, isolated, cases, of, hooliganism, protesters, were, sentenced, to, deportation, with, compulsory, residence, arranged, in, other, cities, despite, such, measures, having, been, repealed, as, far, back, as, the, late, 1950s, the, entire, trial, lasted, only, an, hour, and, a, half, a, few, days, after, the, workers, revolt, c, t, lin, bia, a, student, at, the, faculty, of, forestry, sat, in, front, of, the, canteen, with, a, placard, that, read, the, arrested, workers, must, not, die, he, was, joined, by, colleagues, lucian, silaghi, and, horia, erban, the, three, were, arrested, immediately, subsequently, graffiti, in, solidarity, with, the, workers, revolt, appeared, on, the, campus, and, some, students, distributed, manifestos, security, teams, conducted, a, total, of, seven, arrests, those, arrested, were, investigated, expelled, from, the, faculty, returned, to, their, home, localities, and, placed, under, strict, supervision, along, with, their, families, under, the, ceau, escu, regime, romani, people, in, romania, were, largely, neglected, this, can, be, seen, perhaps, most, blatantly, in, a, motion, from, the, politburo, of, the, central, committee, of, the, romanian, workers, party, which, largely, laid, the, foundation, for, the, ceau, escu, regime, s, policies, regarding, the, rights, of, ethnic, minorities, the, motion, entirely, ignored, the, romani, the, regime, excluded, the, romani, from, its, list, of, co, inhabiting, nationalities, preventing, them, from, gaining, any, government, representation, as, an, ethnic, group, their, exclusion, continued, even, after, increased, representation, of, minorities, such, as, hungarians, and, germans, ceau, escu, largely, wished, to, ignore, the, living, conditions, of, the, romani, who, had, suffered, similar, institutional, neglect, at, the, hands, of, his, predecessors, as, far, back, as, ion, antonescu, the, romani, long, a, highly, vulnerable, ethnic, minority, group, across, europe, were, left, in, significant, poverty, and, at, risk, of, hate, crimes, in, the, country, such, conditions, exist, in, modern, day, romania, as, demonstrated, by, the, policies, of, several, subsequent, presidents, in, november, 1989, the, xivth, congress, of, the, romanian, communist, party, pcr, saw, ceau, escu, then, aged, 71, re, elected, for, another, five, years, as, leader, of, the, pcr, during, the, congress, ceau, escu, made, a, speech, denouncing, the, anti, communist, revolutions, happening, throughout, the, rest, of, eastern, europe, the, following, month, ceau, escu, s, government, itself, collapsed, after, a, series, of, violent, events, in, timi, oara, and, bucharest, czechoslovak, president, gust, v, hus, k, s, resignation, on, 10, december, 1989, amounted, to, the, fall, of, the, communist, regime, in, czechoslovakia, leaving, ceau, escu, s, romania, as, the, only, remaining, hard, line, communist, regime, in, the, warsaw, pact, demonstrations, in, the, city, of, timi, oara, were, triggered, by, the, government, sponsored, attempt, to, evict, l, szl, t, k, s, an, ethnic, hungarian, pastor, accused, by, the, government, of, inciting, ethnic, hatred, members, of, his, ethnic, hungarian, congregation, surrounded, his, apartment, in, a, show, of, support, romanian, students, spontaneously, joined, the, demonstration, which, soon, lost, nearly, all, connection, to, its, initial, cause, and, became, a, more, general, anti, government, demonstration, regular, military, forces, police, and, the, securitate, fired, on, demonstrators, on, 17, december, 1989, killing, and, injuring, men, women, and, children, on, 18, december, 1989, ceau, escu, departed, for, a, state, visit, to, iran, leaving, the, duty, of, crushing, the, timi, oara, revolt, to, his, subordinates, and, his, wife, upon, his, return, to, romania, on, the, evening, of, 20, december, the, situation, became, even, more, tense, and, he, gave, a, televised, speech, from, the, tv, studio, inside, the, central, committee, building, cc, building, in, which, he, spoke, about, the, events, at, timi, oara, in, terms, of, an, interference, of, foreign, forces, in, romania, s, internal, affairs, and, an, external, aggression, on, romania, s, sovereignty, the, country, which, had, little, to, no, information, of, the, events, transpiring, in, timi, oara, from, the, national, media, learned, about, the, revolt, from, anti, communist, radio, stations, that, broadcast, news, in, the, eastern, bloc, throughout, the, cold, war, such, as, voice, of, america, and, radio, free, europe, and, by, word, of, mouth, on, the, next, day, 21, december, ceau, escu, staged, a, mass, meeting, in, bucharest, official, media, presented, it, as, a, spontaneous, movement, of, support, for, ceau, escu, emulating, the, 1968, meeting, in, which, he, had, spoken, against, the, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, by, warsaw, pact, forces, the, mass, meeting, of, 21, december, held, in, what, is, now, revolution, square, began, like, many, of, ceau, escu, s, speeches, over, the, years, he, spoke, of, the, achievements, of, the, socialist, revolution, and, romania, s, multi, laterally, developed, socialist, society, he, also, blamed, the, timi, oara, riots, on, fascist, agitators, who, want, to, destroy, socialism, however, ceau, escu, had, misjudged, the, crowd, s, mood, roughly, eight, minutes, into, his, speech, several, people, began, jeering, and, booing, and, others, began, chanting, timi, oara, he, tried, to, silence, them, by, raising, his, right, hand, and, calling, for, the, crowd, s, attention, before, order, was, temporarily, restored, then, proceeded, to, announce, social, benefit, reforms, that, included, raising, the, national, minimum, wage, by, 200, lei, per, month, to, a, total, of, 2, 200, per, month, by, 1, january, images, of, ceau, escu, s, facial, expression, as, the, crowd, began, to, boo, and, heckle, him, were, among, the, most, widely, broadcast, of, the, collapse, of, communism, in, eastern, europe, failing, to, control, the, crowd, the, ceau, escus, took, cover, inside, the, building, that, housed, the, central, committee, of, the, romanian, communist, party, the, rest, of, the, day, saw, an, open, revolt, of, bucharest, s, population, which, had, assembled, in, university, square, and, confronted, the, police, and, army, at, barricades, the, rioters, however, were, no, match, for, the, military, apparatus, concentrated, in, bucharest, which, cleared, the, streets, by, midnight, and, arrested, hundreds, of, people, in, the, process, by, the, morning, of, 22, december, the, rebellion, had, already, spread, to, all, major, cities, across, the, country, the, suspicious, death, of, vasile, milea, ceau, escu, s, defence, minister, later, confirmed, as, a, suicide, he, tried, to, incapacitate, himself, with, a, flesh, wound, but, a, bullet, severed, his, artery, was, announced, by, the, media, immediately, thereafter, ceau, escu, presided, over, the, cpex, political, executive, committee, meeting, and, assumed, the, leadership, of, the, army, believing, that, milea, had, been, murdered, rank, and, file, soldiers, switched, sides, to, the, revolution, almost, en, masse, the, commanders, wrote, off, ceau, escu, as, a, lost, cause, and, made, no, effort, to, keep, their, men, loyal, to, the, government, ceau, escu, made, a, last, desperate, attempt, to, address, the, crowd, gathered, in, front, of, the, central, committee, building, but, the, people, in, the, square, began, throwing, stones, and, other, projectiles, at, him, forcing, him, to, take, refuge, in, the, building, once, more, he, elena, and, four, others, managed, to, get, to, the, roof, and, escape, by, helicopter, only, seconds, ahead, of, a, group, of, demonstrators, who, had, followed, them, there, the, romanian, communist, party, disappeared, soon, afterwards, unlike, its, kindred, parties, in, the, former, soviet, bloc, it, has, never, been, revived, the, western, press, published, estimates, of, the, number, of, people, killed, by, securitate, forces, the, count, increased, rapidly, until, an, estimated, 64, 000, fatalities, were, reported, across, front, pages, the, hungarian, military, attach, expressed, doubt, regarding, these, figures, pointing, out, the, unfeasible, logistics, of, killing, such, a, large, number, of, people, in, such, a, short, period, after, ceau, escu, s, death, hospitals, across, the, country, reported, a, death, toll, of, fewer, than, 1, 000, and, probably, much, lower, than, that, ceau, escu, and, his, wife, elena, fled, the, capital, with, emil, bobu, and, manea, m, nescu, and, flew, by, helicopter, to, ceau, escu, s, snagov, residence, from, which, they, fled, again, this, time, to, t, rgovi, te, they, abandoned, the, helicopter, near, t, rgovi, te, having, been, ordered, to, land, by, the, army, which, by, that, time, had, restricted, flying, in, romania, s, airspace, the, ceau, escus, were, held, by, the, police, while, the, policemen, listened, to, the, radio, they, were, eventually, handed, over, to, the, army, on, christmas, day, 25, december, 1989, the, ceau, escus, were, tried, before, a, court, convened, in, a, small, room, on, orders, of, the, national, salvation, front, romania, s, provisional, government, they, faced, charges, including, illegal, gathering, of, wealth, and, genocide, ceau, escu, repeatedly, denied, the, court, s, authority, to, try, him, and, asserted, he, was, still, legally, the, president, of, romania, at, the, end, of, the, trial, the, ceau, escus, were, found, guilty, and, sentenced, to, death, a, soldier, standing, guard, in, the, proceedings, was, ordered, to, take, the, ceau, escus, outside, one, by, one, and, shoot, them, but, the, ceau, escus, demanded, to, die, together, the, soldiers, agreed, to, this, and, began, to, tie, their, hands, behind, their, backs, which, the, ceau, escus, protested, against, but, were, powerless, to, prevent, the, ceau, escus, were, executed, by, a, group, of, soldiers, captain, ionel, boeru, sergeant, major, georghin, octavian, and, dorin, marian, c, rlan, and, five, other, non, commissioned, officers, who, were, recruited, from, twenty, volunteers, before, his, sentence, was, carried, out, nicolae, ceau, escu, sang, the, internationale, whilst, being, led, towards, the, wall, the, firing, squad, began, shooting, as, soon, as, the, two, were, in, their, positions, up, against, the, wall, later, that, day, the, execution, was, also, shown, on, romanian, television, the, hasty, show, trial, and, the, images, of, the, dead, ceau, escus, were, videotaped, and, the, footage, released, in, numerous, western, countries, two, days, after, the, execution, the, manner, in, which, the, trial, was, conducted, has, been, criticised, however, ion, iliescu, romania, s, provisional, president, said, in, 2009, that, the, trial, was, quite, shameful, but, necessary, in, order, to, end, the, state, of, near, anarchy, that, had, gripped, the, country, in, the, three, days, since, the, ceau, escus, fled, bucharest, similarly, victor, st, nculescu, who, had, been, defence, minister, before, going, over, to, the, revolution, said, in, 2009, that, the, alternative, would, have, been, seeing, the, ceau, escus, lynched, on, the, streets, of, bucharest, the, ceau, escus, were, the, last, people, to, be, executed, in, romania, before, the, abolition, of, capital, punishment, on, 7, january, 1990, nicolae, and, elena, ceau, escu, were, originally, buried, in, simple, graves, at, ghencea, cemetery, in, bucharest, on, opposite, sides, of, a, path, their, graves, were, often, decorated, with, flowers, and, symbols, of, communist, rule, in, april, 2007, their, son, valentin, ceau, escu, lost, an, appeal, for, an, investigation, into, whether, the, graves, were, genuine, upon, his, death, in, 1996, the, younger, son, nicu, was, buried, nearby, in, the, same, cemetery, according, to, the, jurnalul, na, ional, requests, were, made, by, the, ceau, escus, daughter, zoia, and, by, supporters, of, their, political, views, to, move, their, remains, to, mausoleums, or, to, purpose, built, churches, these, demands, were, denied, by, the, government, on, 21, july, 2010, forensic,

while, the, term, ceau, ism, portmanteau, of, ceau, escu, and, communism, became, widely, used, inside, romania, usually, as, a, pejorative, it, never, achieved, status, in, academia, this, can, be, explained, by, the, largely, crude, and, syncretic, character, of, the, dogma, ceau, escu, attempted, to, include, his, views, in, mainstream, marxist, theory, to, which, he, added, his, belief, in, a, multilaterally, developed, socialist, society, as, a, necessary, stage, between, the, leninist, concepts, of, socialist, and, communist, societies, a, critical, view, reveals, that, the, main, reason, for, the, interval, is, the, disappearance, of, the, state, and, party, structures, in, communism, a, romanian, encyclopedic, dictionary, entry, in, 1978, underlines, the, concept, as, a, new, superior, stage, in, the, socialist, development, of, romania, begun, by, the, 1971, 1975, five, year, plan, prolonged, over, several, five, year, plans, ceau, ism, s, main, trait, was, a, form, of, romanian, nationalism, one, which, arguably, propelled, ceau, escu, to, power, in, 1965, and, probably, led, the, party, leadership, under, ion, gheorghe, maurer, to, select, him, over, the, more, orthodox, gheorghe, apostol, although, he, had, previously, been, a, careful, supporter, of, the, official, lines, ceau, escu, came, to, embody, romanian, society, s, wish, for, independence, after, what, many, considered, years, of, soviet, directives, and, purges, during, and, after, the, sovrom, fiasco, he, carried, this, nationalist, option, inside, the, party, manipulating, it, against, the, nominated, successor, apostol, this, nationalist, policy, had, more, timid, precedents, for, example, gheorghiu, dej, had, overseen, the, withdrawal, of, the, red, army, in, 1958, it, had, also, engineered, the, publishing, of, several, works, that, subverted, the, russian, and, soviet, image, no, longer, glossing, over, traditional, points, of, tension, with, russia, and, the, soviet, union, even, alluding, to, an, unlawful, soviet, presence, in, bessarabia, in, the, final, years, of, gheorghiu, dej, s, rule, more, problems, were, openly, discussed, with, the, publication, of, a, collection, of, karl, marx, s, writings, that, dealt, with, romanian, topics, showing, marx, s, previously, censored, politically, uncomfortable, views, of, russia, ceau, escu, was, prepared, to, take, a, more, decisive, step, in, questioning, soviet, policies, in, the, early, years, of, his, rule, he, generally, relaxed, political, pressures, inside, romanian, society, which, led, to, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, being, the, most, liberal, decade, in, socialist, romania, gaining, the, public, s, confidence, ceau, escu, took, a, clear, stand, against, the, 1968, crushing, of, the, prague, spring, by, leonid, brezhnev, after, a, visit, from, charles, de, gaulle, earlier, in, the, same, year, during, which, the, french, president, gave, recognition, to, the, incipient, maverick, ceau, escu, s, public, speech, in, august, deeply, impressed, the, population, not, only, through, its, themes, but, also, because, uniquely, it, was, unscripted, he, immediately, attracted, western, sympathies, and, backing, which, lasted, well, beyond, the, liberal, phase, of, his, rule, at, the, same, time, the, period, brought, forward, the, threat, of, armed, soviet, invasion, significantly, many, young, men, inside, romania, joined, the, patriotic, guards, created, on, the, spur, of, the, moment, in, order, to, meet, the, perceived, threat, president, richard, nixon, was, invited, to, bucharest, in, 1969, which, was, the, first, visit, of, a, united, states, president, to, a, communist, country, after, the, start, of, the, cold, war, alexander, dub, ek, s, version, of, socialism, with, a, human, face, was, never, suited, to, romanian, communist, goals, ceau, escu, found, himself, briefly, aligned, with, dub, ek, s, czechoslovakia, and, josip, broz, tito, s, yugoslavia, the, latter, friendship, was, to, last, until, tito, s, death, in, 1980, with, ceau, escu, adapting, the, titoist, doctrine, of, independent, socialist, development, to, suit, his, own, objectives, romania, proclaimed, itself, a, socialist, in, place, of, people, s, republic, to, show, that, it, was, fulfilling, marxist, goals, without, moscow, s, oversight, a, move, mirroring, communist, yugoslavia, which, renamed, itself, from, a, federal, people, s, republic, to, a, socialist, federal, republic, a, few, years, earlier, the, system, s, nationalist, traits, grew, and, progressively, blended, with, north, korean, juche, and, chinese, maoist, ideals, in, 1971, the, party, which, had, already, been, completely, purged, of, internal, opposition, with, the, possible, exception, of, gheorghe, gaston, marin, approved, the, july, theses, expressing, ceau, escu, s, disdain, of, western, models, as, a, whole, and, the, reevaluation, of, the, recent, liberalisation, as, bourgeois, the, 1974, xith, party, congress, tightened, the, party, s, grip, on, romanian, culture, guiding, it, towards, ceau, escu, s, nationalist, principles, notably, it, demanded, that, romanian, historians, refer, to, dacians, as, having, an, unorganised, state, part, of, a, political, continuum, that, culminated, in, the, socialist, republic, the, government, continued, its, cultural, dialogue, with, ancient, forms, with, ceau, escu, connecting, his, cult, of, personality, to, figures, such, as, mircea, cel, b, tr, n, lit, mircea, the, elder, whom, he, styled, mircea, the, great, and, mihai, viteazul, michael, the, brave, it, also, started, adding, dacian, or, roman, versions, to, the, names, of, cities, and, towns, drobeta, to, turnu, severin, napoca, to, cluj, although, ceau, escu, maintained, an, independent, national, communist, course, his, absolute, control, over, the, country, as, well, as, the, intensity, of, the, personality, cult, surrounding, him, led, many, non, romanian, observers, to, describe, his, rule, as, one, of, the, closest, things, to, an, old, style, stalinist, regime, the, last, edition, of, the, country, study, on, romania, for, instance, referred, to, the, pcr, s, stalinist, repression, of, individual, liberties, a, new, generation, of, committed, supporters, on, the, outside, confirmed, the, administration, s, character, ceau, escu, probably, never, emphasized, that, his, policies, constituted, a, paradigm, for, theorists, of, national, bolshevism, such, as, jean, fran, ois, thiriart, but, there, was, a, publicised, connection, between, him, and, iosif, constantin, dr, gan, an, iron, guardist, romanian, italian, migr, millionaire, dr, gan, was, already, committed, to, a, dacianist, and, protochronist, attitude, that, largely, echoed, the, official, cultural, policy, nicolae, ceau, escu, had, a, major, influence, on, modern, day, romanian, populist, rhetoric, in, his, final, years, he, had, begun, to, rehabilitate, the, image, of, pro, nazi, dictator, ion, antonescu, although, antonescu, s, image, was, never, a, fully, official, myth, in, ceau, escu, s, time, after, his, overthrow, politicians, such, as, corneliu, vadim, tudor, have, coupled, the, images, of, the, two, leaders, into, their, versions, of, a, national, pantheon, the, conflict, with, hungary, over, the, treatment, of, the, magyar, minority, in, romania, had, several, unusual, aspects, not, only, was, it, a, vitriolic, argument, between, two, officially, socialist, states, it, also, marked, the, moment, when, hungary, a, state, behind, the, iron, curtain, appealed, to, the, organization, for, security, and, co, operation, in, europe, for, sanctions, to, be, taken, against, romania, this, meant, that, the, later, 1980s, were, marked, by, a, pronounced, anti, hungarian, discourse, which, owed, more, to, nationalist, tradition, than, to, marxism, and, the, ultimate, isolation, of, romania, on, the, world, stage, the, strong, opposition, to, ceau, escu, on, all, forms, of, perestroika, and, glasnost, placed, ceau, escu, at, odds, with, mikhail, gorbachev, he, was, very, displeased, when, other, warsaw, pact, countries, decided, to, try, their, own, versions, of, gorbachev, s, reforms, in, particular, he, was, incensed, when, poland, s, leaders, opted, for, a, power, sharing, arrangement, with, the, solidarity, trade, union, he, even, went, as, far, as, to, call, for, a, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, poland, a, significant, reversal, considering, how, violently, he, had, opposed, the, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, 20, years, earlier, for, his, part, gorbachev, made, no, secret, of, his, distaste, for, ceau, escu, whom, he, called, the, romanian, f, hrer, at, a, meeting, between, the, two,
