was, discharged, in, august, and, returned, to, britain, aboard, hms, lion, arriving, in, late, november, nelson, gradually, recovered, over, several, months, and, soon, began, agitating, for, a, command, he, was, appointed, to, the, frigate, hms, albemarle, on, 15, august, 1781, while, nelson, served, in, the, west, indies, he, came, into, contact, with, several, prominent, white, colonists, residing, there, forming, friendships, with, many, of, them, these, relationships, led, nelson, to, absorb, their, proslavery, views, particularly, the, view, that, slavery, was, necessary, to, the, islands, economic, prosperity, according, to, grindal, nelson, later, used, his, social, influence, to, counter, the, emerging, abolitionist, movement, in, britain, university, of, southampton, academic, christer, petley, contextualises, this, view, the, debate, over, the, future, of, slavery, divided, britons, wilberforce, personified, one, type, of, british, patriotism, arguing, for, an, end, to, slave, trading, on, the, basis, that, it, was, a, blot, on, the, reputation, of, a, proud, and, christian, nation, slaveholders, offered, their, own, patriotic, arguments, maintaining, that, the, trade, was, so, instrumental, to, the, imperial, economy, that, britain, could, ill, afford, to, stop, it, nelson, had, befriended, several, slaveholding, colonists, during, his, time, in, the, caribbean, privately, he, came, to, sympathise, with, their, political, outlook, it, is, clear, that, by, the, time, of, his, death, at, trafalgar, he, despised, wilberforce, and, stood, in, staunch, opposition, to, the, british, abolitionist, campaign, over, the, course, of, his, life, nelson, came, into, contact, numerous, times, with, aspects, of, slavery, and, the, people, who, were, involved, in, that, institution, these, included, both, his, relationships, with, caribbean, plantation, owners, and, his, marriage, to, fanny, a, slaveowner, who, was, born, into, a, family, which, belonged, to, the, antiguan, plantocracy, one, of, his, friends, in, the, west, indies, was, simon, taylor, one, of, the, richest, plantation, owners, in, jamaica, who, owned, hundreds, of, slaves, in, 1805, taylor, wrote, to, nelson, requesting, that, he, publicly, intervene, in, favour, of, the, pro, slavery, side, in, britain, s, debate, over, abolition, nelson, wrote, a, letter, back, to, taylor, writing, that, while, a, tongue, he, would, launch, voice, against, the, damnable, and, cursed, sic, doctrine, of, wilberforce, and, his, hypocritical, allies, in, the, same, letter, nelson, also, wrote, that, he, had, always, to, serve, the, public, weal, of, which, the, west, india, colonies, form, so, prominent, and, interesting, a, part, i, have, ever, been, and, shall, die, a, firm, friend, to, our, present, colonial, system, i, was, bred, as, you, know, in, the, good, old, school, and, taught, to, appreciate, the, value, of, our, west, india, possessions, this, letter, was, published, in, 1807, by, the, anti, abolitionist, faction, some, eighteen, months, after, nelson, s, death, and, out, of, context, in, an, apparent, attempt, to, bolster, their, cause, prior, to, the, parliamentary, vote, on, the, abolition, bill, the, wording, of, the, letter, as, published, in, 1807, not, in, nelson, s, handwriting, and, with, a, poor, facsimile, of, his, signature, appears, out, of, character, for, nelson, whose, many, other, surviving, letters, never, expressed, racist, or, pro, slavery, sentiments, comparison, with, the, pressed, copy, of, the, original, letter, now, part, of, the, bridport, papers, held, in, the, british, library, shows, that, the, published, copy, had, 25, alterations, distorting, it, to, give, it, a, more, anti, abolitionist, slant, many, of, nelson, s, actions, indicate, his, position, on, the, matter, of, slavery, most, notably, nelson, received, orders, on, 23, october, 1781, to, take, the, newly, refitted, albemarle, to, sea, he, was, instructed, to, collect, an, inbound, convoy, of, the, russia, company, at, elsinore, and, escort, them, back, to, britain, for, this, operation, the, admiralty, placed, the, frigates, hms, argo, and, hms, enterprise, under, his, command, nelson, successfully, organised, the, convoy, and, escorted, it, into, british, waters, he, then, left, the, convoy, to, return, to, port, but, severe, storms, hampered, him, gales, almost, wrecked, albemarle, as, she, was, a, poorly, designed, ship, and, an, earlier, accident, had, left, her, damaged, but, nelson, eventually, brought, her, into, portsmouth, in, february, 1782, there, the, admiralty, ordered, him, to, fit, albemarle, for, sea, and, join, the, escort, for, a, convoy, collecting, at, cork, ireland, to, sail, for, quebec, canada, nelson, arrived, off, newfoundland, with, the, convoy, in, late, may, then, detached, on, a, cruise, to, hunt, american, privateers, nelson, was, generally, unsuccessful, he, succeeded, only, in, retaking, several, captured, british, merchant, ships, and, capturing, a, number, of, small, fishing, boats, and, assorted, craft, in, august, 1782, nelson, had, a, narrow, escape, from, a, far, superior, french, force, under, louis, philippe, de, vaudreuil, only, evading, them, after, a, prolonged, chase, nelson, arrived, at, quebec, on, 18, september, he, sailed, again, as, part, of, the, escort, for, a, convoy, to, new, york, he, arrived, in, mid, november, and, reported, to, admiral, samuel, hood, commander, of, the, new, york, station, at, nelson, s, request, hood, transferred, him, to, his, fleet, and, albemarle, sailed, in, company, with, hood, bound, for, the, west, indies, on, their, arrival, the, british, fleet, took, up, position, off, jamaica, to, await, the, arrival, of, de, vaudreuil, s, force, nelson, and, the, albemarle, were, ordered, to, scout, the, numerous, passages, for, signs, of, the, enemy, but, it, became, clear, by, early, 1783, that, the, french, had, eluded, hood, during, his, scouting, operations, nelson, had, developed, a, plan, to, attack, the, french, garrison, of, the, turks, islands, commanding, a, small, flotilla, of, frigates, and, smaller, vessels, he, landed, a, force, of, 167, seamen, and, marines, early, on, the, morning, of, 8, march, under, a, supporting, bombardment, the, french, were, found, to, be, heavily, entrenched, and, after, several, hours, nelson, called, off, the, assault, several, of, the, officers, involved, criticised, nelson, but, hood, does, not, appear, to, have, reprimanded, him, nelson, spent, the, rest, of, the, war, cruising, in, the, west, indies, where, he, captured, a, number, of, french, and, spanish, prizes, after, news, of, the, peace, reached, hood, nelson, returned, to, britain, in, late, june, 1783, nelson, visited, france, in, late, 1783, and, stayed, with, acquaintances, at, saint, omer, briefly, attempting, to, learn, french, during, his, stay, he, returned, to, england, in, january, 1784, and, attended, court, as, part, of, lord, hood, s, entourage, influenced, by, the, factional, politics, of, the, time, he, contemplated, standing, for, parliament, as, a, supporter, of, william, pitt, but, was, unable, to, find, a, seat, in, 1784, nelson, received, command, of, the, frigate, hms, boreas, with, the, assignment, to, enforce, the, navigation, acts, in, the, vicinity, of, antigua, nelson, hated, antigua, and, the, only, consolation, was, mrs, mary, moutray, who, he, greatly, admired, the, acts, were, unpopular, with, both, the, americans, and, the, colonies, nelson, served, on, the, station, under, admiral, sir, richard, hughes, and, often, came, into, conflict, with, his, superior, officer, over, their, differing, interpretation, of, the, acts, the, captains, of, the, american, vessels, nelson, had, seized, sued, him, for, illegal, seizure, because, the, merchants, of, the, nearby, island, of, nevis, supported, the, american, claim, nelson, was, in, peril, of, imprisonment, he, remained, sequestered, on, boreas, for, eight, months, until, the, courts, ruled, in, his, favour, in, the, interim, nelson, met, frances, fanny, nisbet, a, young, widow, from, a, nevis, plantation, family, nelson, developed, an, affection, for, her, in, response, her, uncle, john, herbert, offered, him, a, massive, dowry, both, herbert, and, nisbet, concealed, the, fact, that, their, famed, riches, were, a, fiction, and, fanny, did, not, disclose, the, fact, that, she, was, infertile, due, to, a, womb, infection, once, they, were, engaged, herbert, offered, nelson, nowhere, near, the, dowry, he, had, promised, during, the, georgian, era, breaking, a, marital, engagement, was, seen, as, quite, dishonourable, and, so, nelson, and, nisbet, were, married, at, montpelier, estate, on, the, island, of, nevis, on, 11, march, 1787, shortly, before, the, end, of, his, tour, of, duty, in, the, caribbean, the, marriage, was, registered, at, fig, tree, church, in, st, john, s, parish, on, nevis, nelson, returned, to, england, in, july, with, fanny, following, later, following, the, marriage, he, became, the, stepfather, of, nisbet, s, 7, year, old, son, josiah, nisbet, nelson, remained, with, boreas, until, she, was, paid, off, in, november, 1787, he, and, fanny, then, divided, their, time, between, bath, and, london, occasionally, visiting, nelson, s, relations, in, norfolk, in, 1788, they, settled, at, nelson, s, childhood, home, at, burnham, thorpe, now, in, reserve, and, on, half, pay, he, attempted, to, persuade, the, admiralty, and, other, senior, figures, he, was, acquainted, with, such, as, hood, to, provide, him, with, a, command, he, was, unsuccessful, as, there, were, too, few, ships, in, the, peacetime, navy, and, hood, did, not, intercede, on, his, behalf, nelson, spent, his, time, trying, to, find, employment, for, former, crew, members, attending, to, family, affairs, and, cajoling, contacts, in, the, navy, for, a, posting, in, 1792, the, french, revolutionary, government, annexed, the, austrian, netherlands, modern, belgium, which, were, traditionally, preserved, as, a, buffer, state, the, admiralty, recalled, nelson, to, service, and, gave, him, command, of, the, 64, gun, hms, agamemnon, in, january, 1793, nelson, took, his, stepson, josiah, with, him, as, a, midshipman, on, 1, february, france, declared, war, in, may, 1793, nelson, sailed, as, part, of, a, division, under, the, command, of, vice, admiral, william, hotham, joined, later, in, the, month, by, the, rest, of, lord, hood, s, fleet, the, force, initially, sailed, to, gibraltar, and, with, the, intention, of, establishing, naval, superiority, in, the, mediterranean, made, their, way, to, toulon, anchoring, off, the, port, in, july, toulon, was, largely, under, the, control, of, moderate, republicans, and, royalists, but, was, threatened, by, the, forces, of, the, national, convention, which, were, marching, on, the, city, short, of, supplies, and, doubting, their, ability, to, defend, themselves, the, city, authorities, requested, that, hood, take, it, under, his, protection, hood, readily, acquiesced, and, sent, nelson, to, carry, dispatches, to, sardinia, and, naples, requesting, reinforcements, after, delivering, the, dispatches, to, sardinia, agamemnon, arrived, at, naples, in, early, september, there, nelson, met, king, ferdinand, iv, of, naples, followed, by, the, british, ambassador, to, the, kingdom, william, hamilton, at, some, point, during, the, negotiations, for, reinforcements, nelson, was, introduced, to, hamilton, s, new, wife, emma, hamilton, the, former, mistress, of, hamilton, s, nephew, charles, greville, the, negotiations, were, successful, and, 2, 000, men, and, several, ships, were, mustered, by, mid, september, nelson, put, to, sea, in, pursuit, of, a, french, frigate, but, on, failing, to, catch, her, sailed, for, leghorn, and, then, to, corsica, he, arrived, at, toulon, on, 5, october, where, he, found, that, a, large, french, army, had, occupied, the, hills, surrounding, the, city, and, was, bombarding, it, hood, still, hoped, the, city, could, be, held, if, more, reinforcements, arrived, and, sent, nelson, to, join, a, squadron, operating, off, cagliari, early, on, the, morning, of, 22, october, 1793, agamemnon, sighted, five, sails, nelson, closed, with, them, and, discovered, that, they, were, a, french, squadron, he, promptly, gave, chase, firing, on, the, 40, gun, melpomene, during, the, action, of, 22, october, 1793, he, inflicted, considerable, damage, but, the, remaining, french, ships, turned, to, join, the, battle, realising, he, was, outnumbered, nelson, withdrew, and, continued, to, cagliari, arriving, on, 24, october, after, making, repairs, nelson, and, agamemnon, sailed, for, tunis, on, 26, october, with, a, squadron, under, commodore, robert, linzee, on, his, arrival, nelson, was, given, command, of, a, small, squadron, consisting, of, agamemnon, three, frigates, and, a, sloop, and, ordered, to, blockade, the, french, garrison, on, corsica, the, fall, of, toulon, at, the, end, of, december, 1793, severely, damaged, british, fortunes, in, the, mediterranean, hood, had, failed, to, make, adequate, provisions, for, a, withdrawal, and, 18, french, ships, of, the, line, fell, into, republican, hands, nelson, s, mission, to, corsica, took, on, an, added, significance, as, it, could, provide, the, british, with, a, naval, base, close, to, the, french, coast, hood, therefore, reinforced, nelson, with, extra, ships, during, january, 1794, a, british, assault, force, landed, on, the, island, on, 7, february, after, which, nelson, moved, to, intensify, the, blockade, off, bastia, for, the, rest, of, the, month, he, carried, out, raids, along, the, coast, and, intercepted, enemy, shipping, by, late, february, san, fiorenzo, had, fallen, and, british, troops, under, lieutenant, general, david, dundas, entered, the, outskirts, of, bastia, however, dundas, merely, assessed, the, enemy, positions, and, then, withdrew, arguing, that, the, french, were, too, well, entrenched, to, risk, an, assault, nelson, convinced, hood, otherwise, but, a, protracted, debate, between, the, army, and, naval, commanders, meant, that, nelson, did, not, receive, permission, to, proceed, until, late, march, nelson, began, to, land, guns, from, his, ships, and, emplace, them, in, the, hills, surrounding, the, town, on, 11, april, the, british, squadron, entered, the, harbour, and, opened, fire, while, nelson, took, command, of, the, land, forces, and, commenced, bombardment, after, 45, days, the, town, surrendered, nelson, then, prepared, for, an, assault, on, calvi, working, in, company, with, lieutenant, general, charles, stuart, british, forces, landed, at, calvi, on, 19, june, and, immediately, began, moving, guns, ashore, to, occupy, the, heights, surrounding, the, town, while, nelson, directed, a, continuous, bombardment, of, the, enemy, positions, stuart, s, men, began, to, advance, on, the, morning, of, 12, july, nelson, was, at, one, of, the, forward, batteries, when, a, shot, struck, one, of, the, nearby, sandbags, protecting, the, position, spraying, stones, and, sand, nelson, was, struck, by, debris, in, his, right, eye, and, forced, to, retire, from, the, position, however, his, wound, was, soon, bandaged, and, he, returned, to, action, by, 18, july, most, of, the, enemy, positions, had, been, disabled, and, that, night, stuart, supported, by, nelson, stormed, the, main, defensive, position, and, captured, it, repositioning, their, guns, the, british, brought, calvi, under, constant, bombardment, and, the, town, surrendered, on, 10, august, nelson, did, regain, partial, sight, in, his, damaged, eye, after, the, siege, but, by, his, own, account, could, only, distinguish, light, from, dark, but, no, object, after, the, occupation, of, corsica, hood, ordered, nelson, to, open, diplomatic, relations, with, the, city, state, of, genoa, a, strategically, important, potential, ally, soon, afterwards, hood, returned, to, england, and, was, succeeded, by, admiral, william, hotham, as, commander, in, chief, in, the, mediterranean, nelson, put, into, leghorn, and, while, agamemnon, underwent, repairs, met, with, other, naval, officers, at, the, port, and, entertained, a, brief, affair, with, a, local, woman, adelaide, correglia, hotham, arrived, with, the, rest, of, the, fleet, in, december, whereupon, nelson, and, agamemnon, sailed, on, a, number, of, cruises, with, them, in, late, 1794, and, early, 1795, on, 8, march, news, reached, hotham, that, the, french, fleet, was, at, sea, and, heading, for, corsica, he, immediately, set, out, to, intercept, them, and, nelson, eagerly, anticipated, his, first, fleet, action, the, french, were, reluctant, to, engage, and, the, two, fleets, shadowed, each, other, on, 12, march, the, following, day, two, of, the, french, ships, collided, allowing, nelson, to, engage, the, much, larger, 84, gun, a, ira, this, engagement, went, on, for, two, and, a, half, hours, until, the, arrival, of, two, french, ships, forced, nelson, to, veer, away, having, inflicted, heavy, casualties, and, considerable, damage, the, fleets, continued, to, shadow, each, other, before, making, contact, again, on, 14, march, in, the, battle, of, genoa, nelson, joined, the, other, british, ships, in, attacking, the, battered, a, ira, now, under, tow, from, censeur, heavily, damaged, the, two, french, ships, were, forced, to, surrender, and, nelson, took, possession, of, censeur, defeated, at, sea, the, french, abandoned, their, plan, to, invade, corsica, and, returned, to, port, nelson, and, the, fleet, remained, in, the, mediterranean, throughout, the, summer, of, 1795, on, 4, july, agamemnon, sailed, from, san, fiorenzo, with, a, small, force, of, frigates, and, sloops, bound, for, genoa, on, 6, july, nelson, ran, into, the, french, fleet, and, found, himself, pursued, by, several, much, larger, ships, of, the, line, he, retreated, to, san, fiorenzo, arriving, just, ahead, of, the, pursuing, french, who, broke, off, as, nelson, s, signal, guns, alerted, the, british, fleet, in, the, harbour, hotham, pursued, the, french, to, the, hy, res, islands, but, failed, to, bring, them, to, a, decisive, action, a, number, of, small, engagements, were, fought, but, to, nelson, s, dismay, he, saw, little, action, nelson, returned, to, operate, out, of, genoa, intercepting, and, inspecting, merchantmen, and, cutting, out, suspicious, vessels, in, both, enemy, and, neutral, harbours, nelson, formulated, ambitious, plans, for, amphibious, landings, and, naval, assaults, to, frustrate, the, progress, of, the, french, army, of, italy, which, was, now, advancing, on, genoa, but, could, excite, little, interest, in, hotham, in, november, hotham, was, replaced, by, sir, hyde, parker, but, the, situation, in, italy, was, rapidly, deteriorating, the, french, were, raiding, around, genoa, and, strong, jacobin, sentiment, was, rife, within, the, city, itself, a, large, french, assault, at, the, end, of, november, broke, the, allied, lines, forcing, a, general, retreat, towards, genoa, nelson, s, forces, were, able, to, cover, the, withdrawing, army, and, prevent, them, from, being, surrounded, but, he, had, too, few, ships, and, men, to, materially, alter, the, strategic, situation, the, british, were, forced, to, withdraw, from, the, italian, ports, nelson, returned, to, corsica, on, 30, november, angry, and, depressed, with, the, british, failure, and, questioning, his, future, in, the, navy, in, january, 1796, the, position, of, commander, in, chief, of, the, fleet, in, the, mediterranean, passed, to, sir, john, jervis, who, appointed, nelson, to, exercise, independent, command, over, the, ships, blockading, the, french, coast, as, a, commodore, nelson, spent, the, first, half, of, the, year, conducting, operations, to, frustrate, french, advances, and, bolster, britain, s, italian, allies, despite, some, minor, successes, in, intercepting, small, french, warships, such, as, in, the, action, of, 31, may, 1796, when, nelson, s, squadron, captured, a, convoy, of, seven, small, vessels, he, began, to, feel, the, british, presence, on, the, italian, peninsula, was, rapidly, becoming, useless, in, june, the, agamemnon, was, sent, back, to, britain, for, repairs, and, nelson, was, appointed, to, the, 74, gun, hms, captain, in, the, same, month, the, french, thrust, towards, leghorn, and, were, certain, to, capture, the, city, nelson, hurried, there, to, oversee, the, evacuation, of, british, nationals, and, transport, them, to, corsica, after, which, jervis, ordered, him, to, blockade, the, newly, captured, french, port, in, july, he, oversaw, the, occupation, of, elba, but, by, september, the, genoese, had, broken, their, neutrality, to, declare, in, favour, of, the, french, by, october, the, genoese, position, and, continued, french, advances, led, the, british, to, decide, that, the, mediterranean, fleet, could, no, longer, be, supplied, they, ordered, it, to, be, evacuated, to, gibraltar, nelson, helped, oversee, the, withdrawal, from, corsica, and, by, december, 1796, was, aboard, the, frigate, hms, minerve, covering, the, evacuation, of, the, garrison, at, elba, he, then, sailed, for, gibraltar, during, the, passage, nelson, captured, the, spanish, frigate, santa, sabina, and, placed, lieutenants, jonathan, culverhouse, and, thomas, hardy, in, charge, of, the, captured, vessel, taking, the, frigate, s, spanish, captain, on, board, minerve, santa, sabina, was, part, of, a, larger, spanish, force, and, the, following, morning, two, spanish, ships, of, the, line, and, a, frigate, were, sighted, closing, fast, unable, to, outrun, them, nelson, was, initially, determined, to, fight, but, culverhouse, and, hardy, raised, the, british, colours, and, sailed, northeast, drawing, the, spanish, ships, after, them, until, being, captured, giving, nelson, the, opportunity, to, escape, nelson, went, on, to, rendezvous, with, the, british, fleet, at, elba, where, he, spent, christmas, he, sailed, for, gibraltar, in, late, january, and, after, learning, that, the, spanish, fleet, had, sailed, from, cartagena, stopped, just, long, enough, to, collect, hardy, culverhouse, and, the, rest, of, the, prize, crew, captured, with, santa, sabina, before, pressing, on, through, the, straits, to, join, sir, john, jervis, off, cadiz, nelson, joined, sir, john, jervis, fleet, off, cape, st, vincent, and, reported, the, spanish, movements, jervis, decided, to, engage, and, the, two, fleets, met, on, 14, february, 1797, nelson, found, himself, towards, the, rear, of, the, british, line, and, realised, that, it, would, be, a, long, time, before, he, could, bring, captain, into, action, instead, of, continuing, to, follow, the, line, nelson, disobeyed, orders, and, wore, ship, breaking, from, the, line, and, heading, to, engage, the, spanish, van, consisting, of, the, 112, gun, san, josef, the, 80, gun, san, nicolas, and, the, 130, gun, sant, sima, trinidad, captain, engaged, all, three, assisted, by, hms, culloden, which, had, come, to, nelson, s, aid, after, an, hour, of, exchanging, broadsides, which, left, both, captain, and, culloden, badly, damaged, nelson, found, himself, alongside, san, nicolas, he, led, a, boarding, party, across, crying, westminster, abbey, or, glorious, victory, and, forced, her, to, surrender, san, josef, attempted, to, come, to, the, san, nicolas, aid, but, became, entangled, with, her, compatriot, and, was, left, immobile, nelson, led, his, party, from, the, deck, of, san, nicolas, onto, san, josef, and, captured, her, as, well, as, night, fell, the, spanish, fleet, broke, off, and, sailed, for, cadiz, four, ships, had, surrendered, to, the, british, and, two, of, them, were, nelson, s, nelson, was, victorious, but, had, disobeyed, direct, orders, jervis, liked, nelson, and, so, did, not, officially, reprimand, him, but, did, not, mention, nelson, s, actions, in, his, official, report, of, the, battle, he, did, write, a, private, letter, to, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, george, spencer, in, which, he, said, that, nelson, contributed, very, much, to, the, fortune, of, the, day, nelson, also, wrote, several, letters, about, his, victory, reporting, that, his, action, was, being, referred, to, amongst, the, fleet, as, nelson, s, patent, bridge, for, boarding, first, rates, nelson, s, account, was, later, challenged, by, rear, admiral, william, parker, who, had, been, aboard, hms, prince, george, parker, claimed, that, nelson, had, been, supported, by, several, more, ships, than, he, acknowledged, and, that, san, josef, had, already, struck, her, colours, by, the, time, nelson, boarded, her, nelson, s, account, of, his, role, prevailed, and, the, victory, was, well, received, in, britain, jervis, was, made, earl, st, vincent, and, nelson, on, 17, may, was, made, a, knight, of, the, bath, on, 20, february, in, a, standard, promotion, according, to, his, seniority, and, unrelated, to, the, battle, nelson, was, promoted, to, rear, admiral, of, the, blue, nelson, was, given, hms, theseus, as, his, flagship, and, on, 27, may, 1797, was, ordered, to, lie, off, cadiz, monitoring, the, spanish, fleet, and, awaiting, the, arrival, of, spanish, treasure, ships, from, the, american, colonies, he, carried, out, a, bombardment, and, personally, led, an, amphibious, assault, on, 3, july, during, the, action, nelson, s, barge, collided, with, that, of, the, spanish, commander, and, a, hand, to, hand, struggle, ensued, between, the, two, crews, twice, nelson, was, nearly, cut, down, and, both, times, his, life, was, saved, by, a, seaman, named, john, sykes, who, took, the, blows, himself, and, was, badly, wounded, the, british, raiding, force, captured, the, spanish, boat, and, towed, her, back, to, theseus, during, this, period, nelson, developed, a, scheme, to, capture, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, aiming, to, seize, a, large, quantity, of, specie, from, the, treasure, ship, principe, de, asturias, which, was, reported, to, have, recently, arrived, the, battle, plan, called, for, a, combination, of, naval, bombardments, and, an, amphibious, landing, the, initial, attempt, was, called, off, after, adverse, currents, hampered, the, assault, and, the, element, of, surprise, was, lost, nelson, immediately, ordered, another, assault, but, this, was, beaten, back, he, prepared, for, a, third, attempt, to, take, place, during, the, night, although, he, personally, led, one, of, the, battalions, the, operation, ended, in, failure, as, the, spanish, were, better, prepared, than, had, been, expected, and, had, secured, strong, defensive, positions, several, of, the, boats, failed, to, land, at, the, correct, positions, in, the, confusion, while, those, that, did, were, swept, by, gunfire, and, grapeshot, nelson, s, boat, reached, its, intended, landing, point, but, as, he, stepped, ashore, he, was, hit, in, the, right, arm, by, a, musketball, which, fractured, his, humerus, in, multiple, places, he, was, rowed, back, to, theseus, to, be, attended, to, by, its, surgeon, thomas, eshelby, upon, arriving, at, his, ship, he, refused, to, be, helped, aboard, declaring, most, of, the, right, arm, was, amputated, and, within, half, an, hour, nelson, had, returned, to, issuing, orders, to, his, captains, years, later, he, would, excuse, himself, to, commodore, john, thomas, duckworth, for, not, writing, longer, letters, due, to, not, being, naturally, left, handed, later, on, he, developed, the, sensation, of, phantom, limb, in, the, area, of, his, amputation, and, declared, that, he, had, found, the, direct, evidence, of, the, existence, of, soul, meanwhile, a, force, under, sir, thomas, troubridge, had, fought, their, way, to, the, main, square, but, could, go, no, further, unable, to, return, to, the, fleet, because, their, boats, had, been, sunk, troubridge, was, forced, to, enter, into, negotiations, with, the, spanish, commander, and, the, british, were, allowed, to, withdraw, the, expedition, had, failed, to, achieve, any, of, its, objectives, and, had, left, a, quarter, of, the, landing, force, dead, or, wounded, the, squadron, remained, off, tenerife, for, a, further, three, days, and, by, 16, august, had, rejoined, lord, john, jervis, fleet, off, cadiz, despondently, nelson, wrote, to, jervis, he, returned, to, england, aboard, hms, seahorse, arriving, at, spithead, on, 1, september, he, was, met, with, a, hero, s, welcome, the, british, public, had, lionised, nelson, after, cape, st, vincent, and, his, wound, earned, him, sympathy, they, refused, to, attribute, the, defeat, at, tenerife, to, him, preferring, instead, to, blame, poor, planning, on, the, part, of, st, vincent, the, secretary, at, war, william, windham, or, even, prime, minister, william, pitt, nelson, returned, to, bath, with, fanny, before, moving, to, london, in, october, 1797, to, seek, expert, medical, attention, concerning, his, amputation, wound, while, in, london, news, reached, him, that, admiral, duncan, had, defeated, the, dutch, fleet, at, the, battle, of, camperdown, nelson, exclaimed, that, he, would, have, given, his, other, arm, to, have, been, present, he, spent, the, last, months, of, 1797, recuperating, in, london, during, which, time, he, was, awarded, the, freedom, of, the, city, of, london, and, a, pension, of, 1, 000, equivalent, to, 130, 800, in, 2023, a, year, he, used, this, money, to, buy, round, wood, farm, near, ipswich, and, intended, to, retire, there, with, fanny, despite, his, plans, nelson, was, never, to, live, there, although, surgeons, had, been, unable, to, remove, the, central, ligature, from, his, amputation, site, which, had, caused, considerable, inflammation, and, infection, it, came, out, of, its, own, accord, in, early, december, and, nelson, rapidly, began, to, recover, eager, to, return, to, sea, he, began, agitating, for, a, command, and, was, promised, the, 80, gun, hms, foudroyant, as, she, was, not, yet, ready, for, sea, nelson, was, instead, given, command, of, the, 74, gun, hms, vanguard, to, which, he, appointed, edward, berry, as, his, flag, captain, french, activities, in, the, mediterranean, theatre, were, raising, concern, among, the, admiralty, as, napoleon, was, gathering, forces, in, southern, france, but, the, destination, of, his, army, was, unknown, nelson, and, the, vanguard, were, to, be, dispatched, to, cadiz, to, reinforce, the, fleet, on, 28, march, 1798, nelson, hoisted, his, flag, and, sailed, to, join, earl, st, vincent, st, vincent, sent, him, on, to, toulon, with, a, small, force, to, reconnoitre, french, activities, nelson, passed, through, the, straits, of, gibraltar, and, took, up, position, off, toulon, by, 17, may, but, his, squadron, was, dispersed, and, blown, southwards, by, a, strong, gale, which, struck, the, area, on, 20, may, while, the, british, were, battling, the, storm, napoleon, had, sailed, with, his, invasion, fleet, under, the, command, of, vice, admiral, fran, ois, paul, brueys, d, aigalliers, nelson, having, been, reinforced, with, a, number, of, ships, from, st, vincent, went, in, pursuit, nelson, began, searching, the, italian, coast, for, napoleon, s, fleet, but, was, hampered, by, a, lack, of, frigates, that, could, operate, as, fast, scouts, napoleon, had, already, arrived, at, malta, and, after, a, show, of, force, secured, the, island, s, surrender, nelson, followed, him, there, but, by, the, time, he, arrived, the, french, had, already, left, after, a, conference, with, his, captains, he, decided, napoleon, s, most, likely, destination, now, was, egypt, and, headed, for, alexandria, however, upon, nelson, s, arrival, on, 28, june, he, found, no, sign, of, the, french, dismayed, he, withdrew, and, began, searching, to, the, east, of, the, port, during, this, time, on, 1, july, napoleon, s, fleet, arrived, in, alexandria, and, landed, their, forces, unopposed, brueys, anchored, his, fleet, in, aboukir, bay, ready, to, support, napoleon, if, required, nelson, meanwhile, had, crossed, the, mediterranean, again, in, a, fruitless, attempt, to, locate, the, french, and, returned, to, naples, to, re, provision, when, he, again, set, sail, his, intentions, were, to, search, the, seas, off, cyprus, but, he, decided, to, pass, alexandria, again, for, a, final, check, along, the, way, his, force, found, and, captured, a, french, merchant, ship, which, provided, the, first, news, of, the, french, fleet, they, had, passed, south, east, of, crete, a, month, prior, heading, to, alexandria, nelson, hurried, to, the, port, but, again, found, it, empty, of, the, french, searching, along, the, coast, he, finally, discovered, the, french, fleet, in, aboukir, bay, on, 1, august, 1798, nelson, immediately, prepared, for, battle, repeating, a, sentiment, he, had, expressed, at, the, battle, of, cape, st, vincent, before, this, time, tomorrow, i, shall, have, gained, a, peerage, or, westminster, abbey, it, was, late, by, the, time, the, british, arrived, and, the, french, having, anchored, in, a, strong, position, and, possessing, a, combined, firepower, greater, than, that, of, nelson, s, fleet, did, not, expect, them, to, attack, nelson, however, immediately, ordered, his, ships, to, advance, the, french, line, was, anchored, close, to, a, line, of, shoals, in, the, belief, that, this, would, secure, their, port, side, from, attack, brueys, had, assumed, the, british, would, follow, convention, and, attack, his, centre, from, the, starboard, side, however, captain, thomas, foley, aboard, hms, goliath, discovered, a, gap, between, the, shoals, and, the, french, ships, and, took, goliath, into, this, channel, the, unprepared, french, found, themselves, attacked, on, both, sides, the, british, fleet, splitting, with, some, following, foley, and, others, passing, down, the, starboard, side, of, the, french, line, the, british, fleet, was, soon, heavily, engaged, passing, down, the, french, line, and, engaging, their, ships, one, by, one, nelson, on, vanguard, personally, engaged, spartiate, while, also, coming, under, fire, from, aquilon, at, about, eight, o, clock, he, was, with, edward, berry, on, the, quarterdeck, when, a, piece, of, french, shot, struck, him, in, the, forehead, he, fell, to, the, deck, with, a, flap, of, torn, skin, obscuring, his, good, eye, blinded, and, half, stunned, he, felt, sure, he, would, die, and, cried, out, i, am, killed, remember, me, to, my, wife, he, was, taken, below, to, be, seen, by, the, surgeon, after, examining, nelson, the, surgeon, pronounced, the, wound, non, threatening, and, applied, a, temporary, bandage, the, french, van, pounded, by, british, fire, from, both, sides, had, begun, to, surrender, and, the, victorious, british, ships, continued, to, move, down, the, line, bringing, brueys, 118, gun, flagship, orient, under, constant, heavy, fire, orient, caught, fire, under, this, bombardment, and, later, exploded, nelson, briefly, came, on, deck, to, direct, the, battle, but, returned, to, the, surgeon, after, watching, the, destruction, of, orient, the, battle, of, the, nile, was, a, major, blow, to, napoleon, s, ambitions, in, the, east, the, fleet, had, been, destroyed, orient, another, ship, and, two, frigates, had, been, burnt, while, seven, 74, gun, ships, and, two, 80, gun, ships, had, been, captured, only, two, ships, of, the, line, and, two, frigates, escaped, the, forces, napoleon, had, brought, to, egypt, were, stranded, napoleon, attacked, north, along, the, mediterranean, coast, but, turkish, defenders, supported, by, captain, sir, sidney, smith, defeated, his, army, at, the, siege, of, acre, napoleon, then, left, his, army, and, sailed, back, to, france, evading, detection, by, british, ships, given, its, strategic, importance, historians, such, as, ernle, bradford, regard, nelson, s, achievement, at, the, nile, as, the, most, significant, of, his, career, even, greater, than, that, at, trafalgar, seven, years, later, nelson, wrote, dispatches, to, the, admiralty, and, oversaw, temporary, repairs, to, the, vanguard, before, sailing, to, naples, where, he, was, met, with, enthusiastic, celebrations, king, ferdinand, iv, of, naples, in, company, with, the, hamiltons, greeted, him, in, person, when, he, arrived, at, port, and, sir, william, hamilton, invited, nelson, to, stay, at, his, home, celebrations, were, held, in, honour, of, nelson, s, birthday, that, september, 1798, and, he, attended, a, banquet, at, the, hamiltons, house, where, other, officers, had, begun, to, notice, his, attentions, to, emma, lady, hamilton, lord, jervis, himself, had, begun, to, grow, concerned, about, reports, of, nelson, s, behaviour, but, in, early, october, word, of, nelson, s, victory, had, reached, london, and, overshadowed, the, matter, the, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, george, spencer, fainted, upon, hearing, the, news, scenes, of, celebration, erupted, across, the, country, balls, and, victory, feasts, were, held, and, church, bells, were, rung, the, city, of, london, awarded, nelson, and, his, captains, swords, while, the, king, ordered, they, be, presented, with, special, medals, emperor, paul, i, of, russia, sent, nelson, a, gift, and, sultan, selim, iii, of, the, ottoman, empire, awarded, nelson, the, order, of, the, turkish, crescent, as, well, as, the, diamond, chelengk, from, his, own, turban, for, nelson, s, role, in, restoring, ottoman, rule, to, egypt, samuel, hood, after, a, conversation, with, the, prime, minister, told, nelson, s, wife, fanny, that, her, husband, would, likely, be, given, a, viscountcy, similarly, to, jervis, earldom, after, cape, st, vincent, and, adam, duncan, s, viscountcy, after, camperdown, lord, spencer, however, demurred, arguing, that, as, nelson, had, only, been, detached, in, command, of, a, squadron, rather, than, being, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, fleet, such, an, award, would, create, an, unwelcome, precedent, instead, nelson, received, the, title, of, baron, nelson, of, the, nile, nelson, was, dismayed, by, lord, spencer, s, decision, and, declared, that, he, would, rather, have, received, no, title, than, that, of, a, mere, barony, he, was, however, cheered, by, the, attention, showered, on, him, by, the, citizens, of, naples, the, prestige, accorded, him, by, the, kingdom, s, elite, and, the, comforts, he, received, at, the, hamiltons, residence, he, made, frequent, visits, to, their, residence, to, attend, functions, in, his, honour, or, tour, nearby, attractions, with, emma, who, was, almost, constantly, at, his, side, and, with, whom, by, now, he, had, fallen, deeply, in, love, orders, arrived, from, the, admiralty, to, blockade, the, french, forces, in, alexandria, and, malta, a, task, nelson, delegated, to, his, captains, samuel, hood, and, alexander, ball, despite, enjoying, his, lifestyle, in, naples, even, while, judging, it, to, be, a, country, of, fiddlers, and, poets, whores, and, scoundrels, which, he, found, less, than, desirable, nelson, began, to, think, of, returning, to, england, however, king, ferdinand, iv, had, just, faced, an, extended, period, of, pressure, from, his, wife, maria, carolina, of, austria, who, was, advocating, for, an, aggressive, foreign, policy, towards, france, a, country, which, five, years, earlier, had, beheaded, her, sister, and, its, queen, marie, antoinette, sir, william, hamilton, was, joined, in, agreement, with, queen, maria, carolina, and, the, king, finally, agreed, to, declare, war, on, france, the, neapolitan, army, led, by, the, austrian, general, mack, and, supported, by, nelson, s, fleet, retook, rome, from, the, french, in, late, november, 1798, the, french, regrouped, outside,

several, months, in, blockading, naples, while, a, popular, counter, revolutionary, force, under, cardinal, ruffo, known, as, the, sanfedisti, marched, to, retake, the, city, in, late, june, ruffo, s, army, entered, naples, forcing, the, french, and, their, supporters, to, withdraw, to, the, city, s, fortifications, as, rioting, and, looting, broke, out, amongst, the, ill, disciplined, neapolitan, troops, dismayed, by, the, bloodshed, ruffo, agreed, to, a, capitulation, with, the, jacobin, forces, which, allowed, them, safe, conduct, to, france, nelson, arrived, off, naples, on, 24, june, to, find, the, treaty, put, into, effect, his, subsequent, role, is, still, controversial, nelson, aboard, foudroyant, was, outraged, and, backed, by, king, ferdinand, iv, he, insisted, that, the, rebels, must, surrender, unconditionally, they, refused, nelson, appears, to, have, relented, and, the, jacobin, forces, marched, out, to, the, awaiting, transports, nelson, then, had, the, transports, seized, he, took, those, who, had, surrendered, under, the, treaty, under, armed, guard, as, well, as, the, former, admiral, francesco, caracciolo, who, had, commanded, the, neapolitan, navy, under, king, ferdinand, iv, but, had, changed, sides, during, the, brief, jacobin, rule, nelson, ordered, his, trial, by, court, martial, and, refused, caracciolo, s, request, that, it, be, held, by, british, officers, caracciolo, was, also, not, allowed, to, summon, witnesses, in, his, defence, and, was, tried, by, royalist, neapolitan, officers, he, was, sentenced, to, death, caracciolo, requested, to, be, shot, rather, than, hanged, but, nelson, following, the, wishes, of, queen, maria, carolina, a, close, friend, of, lady, hamilton, also, denied, this, request, and, even, ignored, the, court, s, request, to, allow, 24, hours, for, caracciolo, to, prepare, himself, caracciolo, was, hanged, aboard, the, neapolitan, frigate, minerva, at, 5, o, clock, the, same, afternoon, nelson, kept, the, bulk, of, the, jacobins, on, the, transports, and, began, to, hand, hundreds, over, for, trial, and, execution, refusing, to, intervene, despite, pleas, for, clemency, from, both, the, hamiltons, and, queen, maria, carolina, when, the, transports, were, finally, allowed, to, carry, the, jacobins, to, france, less, than, one, third, were, still, alive, on, 13, august, 1799, in, reward, for, his, support, of, the, monarchy, king, ferdinand, iv, gave, nelson, the, newly, created, title, duke, of, bronte, in, the, peerage, of, the, kingdom, of, sicily, as, his, perpetual, property, as, well, as, the, estate, of, the, former, benedictine, abbey, of, santa, maria, di, maniace, which, he, later, transformed, into, the, castello, di, nelson, situated, between, the, comunes, of, bronte, and, maniace, later, known, as, the, duchy, of, nelson, in, 1799, nelson, opposed, the, mistreatment, of, slaves, held, in, portuguese, galleys, off, palermo, and, intervened, to, secure, their, release, nelson, petitioned, the, portuguese, commander, marquiz, de, niza, the, marquis, acquiesced, to, the, unusual, request, allowing, twenty, four, slaves, to, be, transferred, to, hms, bonne, citoyenne, their, blessings, to, nelson, ringing, out, across, the, harbour, as, their, names, were, added, to, the, sloop, s, already, crowded, muster, book, nelson, returned, to, palermo, in, august, and, in, september, became, the, senior, officer, in, the, mediterranean, after, lord, john, jervis, successor, george, elphinstone, 1st, viscount, keith, left, to, chase, the, french, and, spanish, fleets, into, the, atlantic, nelson, spent, most, of, 1799, at, the, neapolitan, court, but, put, to, sea, again, in, february, 1800, after, lord, keith, s, return, keith,

was, during, this, time, that, nelson, and, lady, emma, hamilton, s, illegitimate, daughter, horatia, nelson, was, likely, conceived, nelson, had, a, difficult, relationship, with, his, superior, officer, he, was, gaining, a, reputation, for, insubordination, having, initially, refused, to, send, ships, when, keith, requested, them, and, on, occasion, returning, to, palermo, without, orders, pleading, poor, health, keith, s, reports, and, rumours, of, nelson, s, close, relationship, with, emma, hamilton, were, now, circulating, around, london, and, lord, spencer, wrote, a, pointed, letter, suggesting, that, he, return, home, you, will, be, more, likely, to, recover, your, health, and, strength, in, england, than, in, any, inactive, situation, at, a, foreign, court, however, pleasing, the, respect, and, gratitude, shown, to, you, for, your, services, may, be, the, recall, of, sir, william, hamilton, to, britain, was, a, further, incentive, for, nelson, to, return, in, june, nelson, left, malta, and, conveyed, queen, maria, carolina, and, her, suite, to, leghorn, upon, his, arrival, nelson, shifted, his, flag, to, hms, alexander, but, again, disobeyed, lord, keith, s, orders, by, refusing, to, join, the, main, fleet, keith, travelled, to, leghorn, to, demand, in, person, an, explanation, and, refused, to, be, moved, by, the, queen, s, pleas, to, allow, her, to, be, conveyed, in, a, british, ship, in, the, face, of, keith, s, demands, nelson, reluctantly, struck, his, flag, and, bowed, to, lady, hamilton, s, request, to, return, to, england, over, land,

visited, eisenstaedt, by, september, they, were, in, prague, and, later, called, at, dresden, dessau, and, hamburg, from, there, they, caught, a, packet, ship, to, great, yarmouth, arriving, on, 6, november, nelson, was, given, a, hero, s, welcome, and, after, being, sworn, in, as, a, freeman, of, the, borough, received, the, amassed, crowd, s, applause, he, then, made, his, way, to, london,

first, time, nelson, was, reported, as, being, cold, and, distant, to, his, wife, while, his, attentions, to, lady, hamilton, and, her, obesity, became, the, subject, of, gossip, with, the, marriage, breaking, down, nelson, began, to, hate, even, being, in, the, same, room, as, fanny, events, came, to, a, head, around, christmas, when, according, to, nelson, s, solicitor, fanny, issued, an, ultimatum, on, whether, he, was, to, choose, her, or, lady, hamilton, nelson, replied, i, love, you, sincerely, but, i, cannot, forget, my, obligations, to, lady, hamilton, or, speak, of, her, otherwise, than, with, affection, and, admiration, the, two, never, lived, together, again, shortly, after, his, arrival, in, england, nelson, was, appointed, to, be, second, in, command, of, the,

move, his, flag, from, hms, san, josef, to, hms, st, george, in, preparation, for, a, planned, expedition, to, the, baltic, tired, of, british, ships, imposing, a, blockade, against, french, trade, and, stopping, and, searching, their, merchantmen, the, russian, prussian, danish, and, swedish, governments, had, formed, an, alliance, to, break, the, blockade, nelson, joined, admiral, sir, hyde, parker, s, fleet, at, yarmouth, from, where, they, sailed, for, the, danish, coast, in, march, on, their, arrival, parker, was, inclined, to, blockade, denmark, and, control, the, entrance, to, the, baltic, but, nelson, urged, a, pre, emptive, attack, on, the, danish, fleet, in, the, harbour, of, copenhagen, he, convinced, parker, to, allow, him, to, make, an, assault, and, was, given, significant, reinforcements, parker, himself, would, wait, in, the, kattegat, covering, nelson, s, fleet, in, case, of, the, arrival, of, the, swedish, or, russian, fleets, on, the, morning, of, 2, april, 1801, nelson, began, to, advance, into, copenhagen, harbour, the, battle, began, badly, for, the, british, with, hms, agamemnon, bellona, and, russell, running, aground, and, the, rest, of, the, fleet, encountering, heavier, fire, from, the, danish, shore, batteries, than, had, been, anticipated, sir, hyde, parker, sent, the, signal, for, nelson, to, withdraw, reasoning, i, will, make, the, signal, for, recall, for, nelson, s, sake, if, he, is, in, a, condition, to, continue, the, action, he, will, disregard, it, if, he, is, not, it, will, be, an, excuse, for, his, retreat, and, no, blame, can, be, attached, to, him, nelson, directing, action, aboard, hms, elephant, was, informed, of, the, signal, by, the, signal, lieutenant, frederick, langford, but, angrily, responded, i, told, you, to, look, out, on, the, danish, commodore, and, let, me, know, when, he, surrendered, keep, your, eyes, fixed, on, him, he, then, turned, to, his, flag, captain, thomas, foley, and, said, you, know, foley, i, have, only, one, eye, i, have, a, right, to, be, blind, sometimes, he, raised, the, telescope, to, his, blind, eye, and, said, i, really, do, not, see, the, signal, the, battle, lasted, three, hours, leaving, both, danish, and, british, fleets, heavily, damaged, at, length, nelson, dispatched, a, letter, to, the, danish, commander, crown, prince, frederick, calling, for, a, truce, which, the, prince, accepted, parker, approved, of, nelson, s, actions, in, retrospect, and, nelson, was, given, the, honour, of, going, into, copenhagen, the, next, day, to, open, formal, negotiations, at, a, banquet, that, evening, he, told, prince, frederick, that, the, battle, had, been, the, most, severe, he, had, ever, participated, in, the, outcome, of, the, battle, and, several, weeks, of, ensuing, negotiations, was, a, fourteen, week, armistice, with, nelson, becoming, commander, in, chief, in, the, baltic, sea, upon, parker, s, recall, in, may, as, a, reward, for, the,

to, concede, to, having, lost, sight, of, despard, for, the, last, twenty, years, nelson, directed, a, further, plea, for, clemency, to, prime, minister, henry, addington, who, was, later, to, tell,

in, passing, through, the, strait, of, gibraltar, and, into, the, atlantic, bound, for, the, west, indies, nelson, gave, chase, but, after, arriving, in, the, caribbean, spent, june, in, a, fruitless,

was, given, a, rapturous, reception, from, crowds, who, had, gathered, to, view, his, arrival, senior, british, officials, congratulated, him, for, sustaining, the, close, pursuit, crediting, him, with, saving, the, west, indies, from, a, french, invasion, nelson, briefly, stayed, in, london, where, he, was, cheered, wherever, he, went, before, visiting, merton, place, to, see, lady, hamilton, arriving, in, late, august, he, entertained, a, number, of, his, friends, and, relations, there, over, the, coming, month, and, began, plans, for, a, grand, engagement, with, the, enemy, fleet, one,

general, arthur, wellesley, the, future, duke, of, wellington, met, briefly, in, a, waiting, area, wellington, was, waiting, to, be, debriefed, on, his, indian, operations, and, nelson, on, his, chase, and, future, plans, wellington, later, recalled, entered, at, once, into, conversation, with, me, if, i, can, call, it, conversation, for, it, was, almost, all, on, his, side, and, all, about, himself, and, in, reality, a, style, so, vain, and, so, silly, as, to, surprise, and, almost, disgust, me, after, a, few, minutes, nelson, left, the, room, but, having, then, been, informed, who, his, companion, had, been, returned, and, entered, into, a, more, earnest, and, intelligent, discussion, with, the, young, wellesley, this, lasted, for, a, quarter, of, an, hour, and, encompassed, topics, such, as, the, war, the, state, of, the, colonies, and, the, geopolitical, situation, on, this, second, discussion, wellesley, recalled, i, don, t, know, that, i, ever, had, a, conversation, that, interested, me, more, this, was, the, only, meeting, between, the, two, men, nelson, returned, briefly, to, merton, to, set, his, affairs, in, order, and, bid, farewell, to, emma, before, travelling,

wishers, gathered, they, accompanied, nelson, to, his, barge, and, cheered, him, off, which, nelson, acknowledged, by, raising, his, hat, he, was, recorded, as, having, turned, to, his, colleague, and, stated, i, had, their, huzzas, before, i, have, their, hearts, now, robert, southey, reported, on, the, onlookers, for, nelson, s, walk, to, the, dock, many, were, in, tears, and, many, knelt, down, before, him, and, blessed, him, as, he, passed, victory, joined, the, british, fleet, off, c, diz, on, 27, september, and, nelson, took, over, from, vice, admiral, cuthbert, collingwood, nelson, spent, the, following, weeks, preparing, and, refining, his, tactics, for, the, anticipated, battle, and, dining, with, his, captains, to, ensure, they, understood, his, intentions, he, had, devised, a, plan, of, attack, that, anticipated, the, allied, fleet, would, form, up, in, a, traditional, line, of, battle, drawing, on, his, own, experience, from, the, nile, and, copenhagen, and, the, examples, of, duncan, at, camperdown, and, rodney, at, the, saintes, nelson, decided, to, split, his, fleet, into, squadrons, rather, than, forming, it, into, a, similar, line, parallel, to, the,

their, opponents, formation, before, unengaged, enemy, ships, could, come, to, their, aid, the, combined, french, and, spanish, fleet, under, villeneuve, s, command, numbered, thirty, three, ships, of, the, line, napoleon, had, intended, for, villeneuve, to, sail, into, the, english, channel, and, cover, a, planned, invasion, of, britain, however, the, entry, of, austria, and, russia, into, the, war, forced, napoleon, to, call, off, this, invasion, and, transfer, troops, to, germany, villeneuve, had, been, reluctant, to, risk, engagement, with, the, british, and, this, reluctance, led, napoleon, to, send, vice, admiral, fran, ois, rosily, to, c, diz, in, order, to, take, command, of, the, fleet, rosily, was, then, to, sail, it, into, the, mediterranean, and, land, troops, at, naples, before, making, port, at, toulon, villeneuve, decided, to, sail, the, fleet, out, before, his, successor, could, arrive, on, 20, october, 1805, the, fleet, was, sighted, making, its, way, out, of, harbour, by, patrolling, british, frigates, and, nelson, was, informed, that, they, appeared, to, be, heading, to, the, west, at, four, o, clock, in, the, morning, of, 21, october, nelson, ordered, the, victory, to, turn, towards, the, approaching, enemy, fleet, and, signalled, the, rest, of, his, force, to, battle, stations, he, then, went, below, and, made, out, his, will, before, returning, to, the, quarterdeck, to, carry, out, an, inspection, despite, having, twenty, seven, ships, to, villeneuve, s, thirty, three, nelson, was, confident, of, success, declaring, that, he, would, not, be, satisfied, with, taking, fewer, than, twenty, prizes, he, returned, briefly, to, his, cabin, to, write, a, final, prayer, after, which, he, joined, victory, s, signal, lieutenant, john, pasco, mr, pasco, i, wish, to, say, to, the, fleet, england, confides, that, every, man, will, do, his, duty, you, must, be, quick, for, i, have, one, more, signal, to, make, which, is, for, close, action, pasco, suggested, changing, confides, to, expects, which, being, in, the, signal, book, could, be, signalled, by, the, use, of, a, single, code, three, flags, whereas, confides, would, have, to, be, spelt, out, letter, by, letter, nelson, agreed, and, the, signal, was, hoisted, as, the, fleets, converged, victory, s, captain, thomas, hardy, suggested, that, nelson, remove, the, decorations, on, his, coat, so, that, he, would, not, be, so, easily, identified, by, enemy, sharpshooters, nelson, replied, that, it, was, too, late, to, be, shifting, a, coat, adding, that, they, were, military, orders, and, he, did, not, fear, to, show, them, to, the, enemy, captain, henry, blackwood, of, the, frigate, hms, euryalus, suggested, nelson, come, aboard, his, ship, to, better, observe, the, battle, nelson, refused, and, also, turned, down, hardy, s, suggestion, to, let, admiral, sir, eliab, harvey, s, hms, temeraire, come, ahead, of, victory, and, lead, the, line, into, battle, victory, came, under, fire, initially, passing, wide, but, then, with, greater, accuracy, as, the, distances, decreased, a, cannonball, struck, and, killed, nelson, s, secretary, john, scott, nearly, cutting, him, in, two, hardy, s, clerk, then, took, over, but, he, too, was, almost, immediately, killed, victory, s, wheel, was, shot, away, another, cannonball, cut, down, eight, marines, standing, next, to, nelson, on, the, quarterdeck, hardy, s, shoe, buckle, was, suddenly, dented, by, a, splinter, nelson, observed, this, is, too, warm, work, to, last, long, victory, had, by, now, reached, the, enemy, line, and, hardy, asked, nelson, which, ship, to, engage, first, nelson, told, him, to, take, his, pick, whereupon, hardy, moved, victory, across, the, stern, of, the, 80, gun, french, flagship, bucentaure, victory, then, came, under, fire, from, the, 74, gun, redoutable, which, was, lying, off, bucentaure, s, stern, as, well, as, the, 130, gun, sant, sima, trinidad, as, sharpshooters, from, the, enemy, ships, fired, onto, victory, s, deck, from, their, rigging, nelson, and, hardy, continued, directing, and, giving, orders, at, a, quarter, past, one, in, the, afternoon, hardy, realised, that, nelson, was, not, by, his, side, he, turned, to, see, nelson, kneeling, on, the, deck, supporting, himself, with, his, hand, before, falling, onto, his, side, hardy, rushed, to, him, at, which, point, nelson, smiled, hardy, i, do, believe, they, have, done, it, at, last, my, backbone, is, shot, through, he, had, been, hit, by, a, musket, ball, fired, from, the, mizzen, top, of, redoutable, at, a, range, of, 50, feet, 15, m, the, ball, entered, his, left, shoulder, passed, through, a, lung, then, his, spine, at, the, sixth, and, seventh, thoracic, vertebrae, and, lodged, two, inches, 5, cm, below, his, right, shoulder, blade, in, the, muscles, of, his, back, nelson, was, carried, below, to, the, cockpit, by, sergeant, major, of, marines, robert, adair, and, two, seamen, as, he, was, being, carried, down, he, asked, them, to, pause, while, he, gave, advice, to, a, midshipman, on, the, handling, of, the, tiller, he, then, draped, a, handkerchief, over, his, face, to, avoid, causing, alarm, amongst, the, crew, he, was, taken, to, ship, surgeon, william, beatty, telling, him, you, can, do, nothing, for, me, i, have, but, a, short, time, to, live, my, back, is, shot, through, nelson, was, made, comfortable, fanned, and, brought, lemonade, and, watered, wine, to, drink, after, he, complained, of, feeling, hot, and, thirsty, he, asked, several, times, to, see, hardy, who, was, on, deck, supervising, the, battle, and, asked, beatty, to, remember, him, to, emma, his, daughter, and, his, friends, hardy, came, belowdecks, to, see, nelson, just, after, half, past, two, and, informed, him, that, a, number, of, enemy, ships, had, surrendered, nelson, told, him, that, he, was, sure, to, die, and, begged, him, to, pass, his, possessions, on, to, emma, those, with, nelson, at, this, point, were, the, chaplain, alexander, scott, the, purser, walter, burke, nelson, s, steward, chevalier, and, beatty, nelson, fearing, that, a, gale, was, blowing, up, instructed, hardy, to, be, sure, to, anchor, after, reminding, him, to, take, care, of, poor, lady, hamilton, nelson, said, kiss, me, hardy, beatty, recorded, that, hardy, knelt, and, kissed, nelson, on, the, cheek, he, then, stood, for, a, minute, or, two, before, kissing, nelson, on, the, forehead, nelson, asked, who, is, that, on, hearing, that, it, was, hardy, he, replied, god, bless, you, hardy, by, now, very, weak, nelson, continued, to, murmur, instructions, to, burke, and, scott, fan, fan, rub, rub, drink, drink, beatty, had, heard, nelson, murmur, thank, god, i, have, done, my, duty, and, when, he, returned, nelson, s, voice, had, faded, and, his, pulse, was, very, weak, nelson, looked, up, as, beatty, took, his, pulse, then, closed, his, eyes, scott, who, remained, by, nelson, as, he, died, recorded, his, last, words, as, god, and, my, country, nelson, died, at, half, past, four, in, the, afternoon, three, hours, after, he, had, been, shot, he, was, 47, years, old, nelson, s, body, was, placed, in, a, cask, of, brandy, mixed, with, camphor, and, myrrh, which, was, then, lashed, to, the, victory, s, mainmast, and, placed, under, guard, this, was, a, controversial, decision, with, the, public, later, believing, it, would, have, been, better, for, him, to, have, been, put, in, rum, instead, to, better, preserve, him, victory, was, towed, to, gibraltar, after, the, battle, and, on, arrival, the, body, was, transferred, to, a, lead, lined, coffin, filled, with, spirits, of, wine, and, his, effects, uniforms, and, papers, sent, separately, collingwood, s, dispatches, about, the, battle, were, carried, to, england, aboard, hms, pickle, and, when, the, news, arrived, in, london, a, messenger, was, sent, to, merton, place, to, bring, the, news, of, nelson, s, death, to, emma, hamilton, she, later, recalled, they, brought, me, word, mr, whitby, from, the, admiralty, show, him, in, directly, i, said, he, came, in, and, with, a, pale, countenance, and, faint, voice, said, we, have, gained, a, great, victory, never, mind, your, victory, i, said, my, letters, give, me, my, letters, captain, whitby, was, unable, to, speak, tears, in, his, eyes, and, a, deathly, paleness, over, his, face, made, me, comprehend, him, i, believe, i, gave, a, scream, and, fell, back, and, for, ten, hours, i, could, neither, speak, nor, shed, a, tear, king, george, iii, on, receiving, the, news, is, alleged, to, have, said, in, tears, we, have, lost, more, than, we, have, gained, the, times, reported, we, do, not, know, whether, we, should, mourn, or, rejoice, the, country, has, gained, the, most, splendid, and, decisive, victory, that, has, ever, graced, the, naval, annals, of, england, but, it, has, been, dearly, purchased, nelson, s, body, was, unloaded, from, the, victory, at, the, nore, it, was, conveyed, upriver, in, commander, sir, george, grey, s, yacht, chatham, to, greenwich, and, placed, inside, a, lead, coffin, the, lead, coffin, was, then, placed, inside, a, wooden, one, made, from, the, mast, of, l, orient, which, had, been, salvaged, after, the, battle, of, the, nile, he, lay, in, state, for, three, days, in, the, painted, hall, of, greenwich, hospital, where, the, surrounding, arrangements, all, but, disintegrated, under, the, crush, of, crowds, far, greater, than, authorities, had, anticipated, his, body, was, then, taken, upriver, aboard, a, barge, originally, used, as, king, charles, ii, s, state, barge, accompanied, by, lord, samuel, hood, chief, mourner, sir, peter, parker, and, the, prince, of, wales, the, prince, of, wales, at, first, announced, his, intention, of, attending, the, funeral, as, chief, mourner, however, he, ultimately, attended, in, a, private, capacity, along, with, his, brothers, when, his, father, king, george, iii, reminded, him, that, it, was, against, protocol, for, the, heir, to, the, throne, to, attend, the, funerals, of, anyone, except, members, of, the, royal, family, on, 8, january, 1806, the, coffin, was, taken, into, the, admiralty, for, the, night, attended, by, nelson, s, chaplain, alexander, scott, the, following, day, 9, january, a, funeral, procession, consisting, of, 32, admirals, over, a, hundred, captains, and, an, escort, of, 10, 000, soldiers, took, the, coffin, from, the, admiralty, to, st, paul, s, cathedral, after, a, four, hour, service, he, was, interred, within, a, crypt, in, a, sarcophagus, originally, carved, for, cardinal, wolsey, the, sarcophagus, and, its, base, had, been, previously, taken, over, for, the, tomb, of, henry, viii, which, was, never, completed, the, sailors, charged, with, folding, the, flag, which, they, were, to, then, place, on, nelson, s, coffin, after, it, had, been, lowered, through, the, floor, of, the, nave, instead, tore, it, into, fragments, each, taking, a, piece, as, a, memorial, of, their, fallen, commander, nelson, was, regarded, as, a, highly, effective, leader, and, someone, who, was, able, to, sympathise, with, the, needs, of, his, men, he, based, his, command, on, love, rather, than, authority, inspiring, both, his, superiors, and, his, subordinates, with, his, considerable, courage, commitment, and, charisma, dubbed, the, nelson, touch, nelson, combined, this, talent, with, an, adept, grasp, of, strategy, and, politics, making, him, a, highly, successful, naval, commander, admiral, t, g, heihachir, himself, often, called, the, nelson, of, the, east, placed, nelson, as, among, the, greatest, naval, commanders, in, history, second, only, to, admiral, yi, sun, sin, the, memorandum, nelson, wrote, before, trafalgar, expresses, his, attitude, well, no, captain, can, do, very, wrong, if, he, places, his, ship, alongside, that, of, the, enemy, nelson, s, personality, was, complex, often, characterised, by, a, desire, to, be, noticed, both, by, his, superiors, and, the, public, he, was, easily, flattered, by, praise, and, dismayed, when, he, felt, he, was, not, given, sufficient, credit, for, his, actions, this, led, him, to, take, risks, and, to, enthusiastically, publicise, his, resultant, successes, which, was, not, always, considered, acceptable, at, the, time, nelson, was, also, highly, confident, in, his, abilities, determined, and, able, to, make, important, decisions, his, active, career, meant, that, he, was, considerably, experienced, in, combat, and, was, a, shrewd, judge, of, his, opponents, able, to, identify, and, exploit, his, enemies, weaknesses, he, was, often, prone, to, insecurities, however, as, well, as, violent, mood, swings, and, was, extremely, vain, he, loved, to, receive, decorations, and, tributes, despite, his, personality, he, remained, a, highly, professional, leader, and, was, driven, all, his, life, by, a, strong, sense, of, duty, nelson, s, fame, reached, new, heights, after, his, death, and, he, came, to, be, regarded, as, one, of, britain, s, greatest, military, heroes, ranked, alongside, the, duke, of, marlborough, and, duke, of, wellington, in, the, bbc, s, 100, greatest, britons, programme, in, 2002, nelson, was, voted, the, ninth, greatest, briton, of, all, time, aspects, of, nelson, s, life, and, career, were, controversial, both, during, his, lifetime, and, after, his, death, his, affair, with, emma, hamilton, was, widely, remarked, upon, and, disapproved, of, to, the, extent, that, emma, was, denied, permission, to, attend, his, funeral, she, and, their, daughter, horatia, were, also, subsequently, ignored, by, the, government, which, awarded, nelson, s, money, and, titles, only, to, legitimate, family, nelson, s, actions, during, the, reoccupation, of, naples, have, also, been, the, subject, of, debate, his, approval, of, the, wave, of, reprisals, against, the, jacobins, who, had, surrendered, under, the, terms, agreed, by, cardinal, ruffo, as, well, as, his, personal, intervention, in, securing, the, execution, of, francesco, caracciolo, are, considered, by, some, biographers, such, as, robert, southey, to, have, been, a, shameful, breach, of, honour, a, prominent, contemporary, politician, charles, james, fox, was, among, those, who, attacked, nelson, for, his, actions, at, naples, declaring, in, the, house, of, commons, i, wish, that, the, atrocities, of, which, we, hear, so, much, and, which, i, abhor, as, much, as, any, man, were, indeed, unexampled, i, fear, that, they, do, not, belong, exclusively, to, the, french, naples, for, instance, has, been, what, is, called, delivered, and, yet, if, i, am, rightly, informed, it, has, been, stained, and, polluted, by, murders, so, ferocious, and, by, cruelties, of, every, kind, so, abhorrent, that, the, heart, shudders, at, the, recital, demanded, that, a, british, officer, should, be, brought, forward, and, to, him, they, capitulated, they, made, terms, with, him, under, the, sanction, of, the, british, name, before, they, sailed, their, property, was, confiscated, numbers, were, thrown, into, dungeons, and, some, of, them, i, understand, notwithstanding, the, british, guarantee, were, actually, executed, other, pro, republican, writers, produced, books, and, pamphlets, decrying, the, events, in, naples, as, atrocities, later, assessments, including, one, by, andrew, lambert, have, stressed, that, the, armistice, had, not, been, authorised, by, the, king, of, naples, and, that, the, retribution, meted, out, by, the, neapolitans, was, not, unusual, for, the, time, lambert, also, suggests, that, nelson, in, fact, acted, to, put, an, end, to, the, bloodshed, using, his, ships, and, men, to, restore, order, in, the, city, nelson, s, influence, continued, long, after, his, death, and, saw, periodic, revivals, of, interest, especially, during, times, of, crisis, in, britain, in, the, 1860s, poet, laureate, alfred, tennyson, appealed, to, the, image, and, tradition, of, nelson, in, order, to, oppose, the, defence, cuts, being, made, by, prime, minister, william, ewart, gladstone, first, sea, lord, jackie, fisher, was, a, keen, exponent, of, nelson, during, the, early, years, of, the, twentieth, century, and, often, emphasised, his, legacy, during, his, period, of, naval, reform, winston, churchill, also, found, nelson, to, be, a, source, of, inspiration, during, the, second, world, war, nelson, has, been, frequently, depicted, in, art, and, literature, appearing, in, paintings, by, benjamin, west, and, arthur, william, devis, and, in, books, and, biographies, by, john, mcarthur, james, stanier, clarke, and, robert, southey, nelson, is, also, celebrated, and, commemorated, in, numerous, songs, written, both, during, his, life, and, following, his, death, nelson, s, victory, in, the, battle, of, the, nile, is, commemorated, in, the, battle, of, the, nile, a, favourite, patriotic, song, thomas, attwood, s, nelson, s, tomb, a, favourite, song, commemorates, nelson, s, death, in, the, battle, of, trafalgar,

most, certainly, saw, haydn, s, new, mass, and, in, response, he, met, and, gave, the, elderly, haydn, a, watch, he, wore, during, the, battle, the, city, of, nelson, in, new, zealand, is, named, after, him, a, number, of, monuments, and, memorials, were, constructed, across, the, country, and, abroad, to, honour, his, memory, and, achievements, dublin, s, monument, to, nelson, nelson, s,

statue, of, the, vice, admiral, lord, horatio, nelson, is, an, important, historic, relic, it, is, not, a, relic, to, be, placed, in, the, national, heroes, square, of, a, nation, that, has, had, to, fight, for, too, long, to, shape, its, destiny, and, to, forge, a, positive, future, for, its, citizens, nelson, s, titles, as, inscribed, on, his, coffin, and, read, out, at, the, funeral, by, the,
