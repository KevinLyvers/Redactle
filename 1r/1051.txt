empire, into, modern, western, culture, the, greek, language, became, the, lingua, franca, of, the, region, and, was, the, predominant, language, of, the, byzantine, empire, until, its, collapse, in, the, mid, 15th, century, ad, alexander, became, legendary, as, a, classical, hero, in, the, mould, of, achilles, featuring, prominently, in, the, historical, and, mythical, traditions, of, both, greek, and, non, greek, cultures, his, military, achievements, and, unprecedented, enduring, successes, in, battle, made, him, the, measure, against, which, many, later, military, leaders, would, compare, themselves, and, his, tactics, remain, a, significant, subject, of, study, in, military, academies, worldwide, legends, of, alexander, s, exploits, coalesced, into, the, third, century, alexander, romance, which, in, the, premodern, period, went, through, over, one, hundred, recensions, translations, and, derivations, and, was, translated, into, almost, every, european, vernacular, and, every, language, of, the, islamic, world, after, the, bible, it, was, the, most, popular, form, of, european, literature, alexander, iii, was, born, in, pella, the, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, macedon, on, the, sixth, day, of, the, ancient, greek, month, of, hekatombaion, which, probably, corresponds, to, 20, july, 356, bc, although, the, exact, date, is, uncertain, he, was, the, son, of, the, erstwhile, king, of, macedon, philip, ii, and, his, fourth, wife, olympias, daughter, of, neoptolemus, i, king, of, epirus, although, philip, had, seven, or, eight, wives, olympias, was, his, principal, wife, for, some, time, likely, because, she, gave, birth, to, alexander, several, legends, surround, alexander, s, birth, and, childhood, according, to, the, ancient, greek, biographer, plutarch, on, the, eve, of, the, consummation, of, her, marriage, to, philip, olympias, dreamed, that, her, womb, was, struck, by, a, thunderbolt, that, caused, a, flame, to, spread, far, and, wide, before, dying, away, sometime, after, the, wedding, philip, is, said, to, have, seen, himself, in, a, dream, securing, his, wife, s, womb, with, a, seal, engraved, with, a, lion, s, image, plutarch, offered, a, variety, of, interpretations, for, these, dreams, that, olympias, was, pregnant, before, her, marriage, indicated, by, the, sealing, of, her, womb, or, that, alexander, s, father, was, zeus, ancient, commentators, were, divided, about, whether, the, ambitious, olympias, promulgated, the, story, of, alexander, s, divine, parentage, variously, claiming, that, she, had, told, alexander, or, that, she, dismissed, the, suggestion, as, impious, on, the, day, alexander, was, born, philip, was, preparing, a, siege, on, the, city, of, potidea, on, the, peninsula, of, chalcidice, that, same, day, philip, received, news, that, his, general, parmenion, had, defeated, the, combined, illyrian, and, paeonian, armies, and, that, his, horses, had, won, at, the, olympic, games, it, was, also, said, that, on, this, day, the, temple, of, artemis, in, ephesus, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, world, burnt, down, this, led, hegesias, of, magnesia, to, say, that, it, had, burnt, down, because, artemis, was, away, attending, the, birth, of, alexander, such, legends, may, have, emerged, when, alexander, was, king, and, possibly, at, his, instigation, to, show, that, he, was, superhuman, and, destined, for, greatness, from, conception, in, his, early, years, alexander, was, raised, by, a, nurse, lanike, sister, of, alexander, s, future, general, cleitus, the, black, later, in, his, childhood, alexander, was, tutored, by, the, strict, leonidas, a, relative, of, his, mother, and, by, lysimachus, of, acarnania, alexander, was, raised, in, the, manner, of, noble, macedonian, youths, learning, to, read, play, the, lyre, ride, fight, and, hunt, when, alexander, was, ten, years, old, a, trader, from, thessaly, brought, philip, a, horse, which, he, offered, to, sell, for, thirteen, talents, the, horse, refused, to, be, mounted, and, philip, ordered, it, away, alexander, however, detecting, the, horse, s, fear, of, its, own, shadow, asked, to, tame, the, horse, which, he, eventually, managed, plutarch, stated, that, philip, overjoyed, at, this, display, of, courage, and, ambition, kissed, his, son, tearfully, declaring, my, boy, you, must, find, a, kingdom, big, enough, for, your, ambitions, macedon, is, too, small, for, you, and, bought, the, horse, for, him, alexander, named, it, bucephalas, meaning, ox, head, bucephalas, carried, alexander, as, far, as, india, when, the, animal, died, because, of, old, age, according, to, plutarch, at, age, 30, alexander, named, a, city, after, him, bucephala, when, alexander, was, 13, philip, began, to, search, for, a, tutor, and, considered, such, academics, as, isocrates, and, speusippus, the, latter, offering, to, resign, from, his, stewardship, of, the, academy, to, take, up, the, post, in, the, end, philip, chose, aristotle, and, provided, the, temple, of, the, nymphs, at, mieza, as, a, classroom, in, return, for, teaching, alexander, philip, agreed, to, rebuild, aristotle, s, hometown, of, stageira, which, philip, had, razed, and, to, repopulate, it, by, buying, and, freeing, the, ex, citizens, who, were, slaves, or, pardoning, those, who, were, in, exile, mieza, was, like, a, boarding, school, for, alexander, and, the, children, of, macedonian, nobles, such, as, ptolemy, hephaistion, and, cassander, many, of, these, students, would, become, his, friends, and, future, generals, and, are, often, known, as, the, companions, aristotle, taught, alexander, and, his, companions, about, medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and, art, under, aristotle, s, tutelage, alexander, developed, a, passion, for, the, works, of, homer, and, in, particular, the, iliad, aristotle, gave, him, an, annotated, copy, which, alexander, later, carried, on, his, campaigns, alexander, was, able, to, quote, euripides, from, memory, in, his, youth, alexander, was, also, acquainted, with, persian, exiles, at, the, macedonian, court, who, received, the, protection, of, philip, ii, for, several, years, as, they, opposed, artaxerxes, iii, among, them, were, artabazos, ii, and, his, daughter, barsine, possible, future, mistress, of, alexander, who, resided, at, the, macedonian, court, from, 352, to, 342, bc, as, well, as, amminapes, future, satrap, of, alexander, or, a, persian, nobleman, named, sisines, this, gave, the, macedonian, court, a, good, knowledge, of, persian, issues, and, may, even, have, influenced, some, of, the, innovations, in, the, management, of, the, macedonian, state, suda, writes, that, anaximenes, of, lampsacus, was, one, of, alexander, s, teachers, and, that, anaximenes, also, accompanied, alexander, on, his, campaigns, at, the, age, of, 16, alexander, s, education, under, aristotle, ended, philip, ii, had, waged, war, against, the, thracians, to, the, north, which, left, alexander, in, charge, as, regent, and, heir, apparent, during, philip, s, absence, the, thracian, tribe, of, maedi, revolted, against, macedonia, alexander, responded, quickly, and, drove, them, from, their, territory, the, territory, was, colonized, and, a, city, named, alexandropolis, was, founded, upon, philip, s, return, alexander, was, dispatched, with, a, small, force, to, subdue, the, revolts, in, southern, thrace, campaigning, against, the, greek, city, of, perinthus, alexander, reportedly, saved, his, father, s, life, meanwhile, the, city, of, amphissa, began, to, work, lands, that, were, sacred, to, apollo, near, delphi, a, sacrilege, that, gave, philip, the, opportunity, to, further, intervene, in, greek, affairs, while, philip, was, occupied, in, thrace, alexander, was, ordered, to, muster, an, army, for, a, campaign, in, southern, greece, concerned, that, other, greek, states, might, intervene, alexander, made, it, look, as, though, he, was, preparing, to, attack, illyria, instead, during, this, turmoil, the, illyrians, invaded, macedonia, only, to, be, repelled, by, alexander, philip, and, his, army, joined, his, son, in, 338, bc, and, they, marched, south, through, thermopylae, taking, it, after, stubborn, resistance, from, its, theban, garrison, they, went, on, to, occupy, the, city, of, elatea, only, a, few, days, march, from, both, athens, and, thebes, the, athenians, led, by, demosthenes, voted, to, seek, alliance, with, thebes, against, macedonia, both, athens, and, philip, sent, embassies, to, win, thebes, s, favour, but, athens, won, the, contest, philip, marched, on, amphissa, ostensibly, acting, on, the, request, of, the, amphictyonic, league, capturing, the, mercenaries, sent, there, by, demosthenes, and, accepting, the, city, s, surrender, philip, then, returned, to, elatea, sending, a, final, offer, of, peace, to, athens, and, thebes, who, both, rejected, it, as, philip, marched, south, his, opponents, blocked, him, near, chaeronea, boeotia, during, the, ensuing, battle, of, chaeronea, philip, commanded, the, right, wing, and, alexander, the, left, accompanied, by, a, group, of, philip, s, trusted, generals, according, to, the, ancient, sources, the, two, sides, fought, bitterly, for, some, time, philip, deliberately, commanded, his, troops, to, retreat, counting, on, the, untested, athenian, hoplites, to, follow, thus, breaking, their, line, alexander, was, the, first, to, break, the, theban, lines, followed, by, philip, s, generals, having, damaged, the, enemy, s, cohesion, philip, ordered, his, troops, to, press, forward, and, quickly, routed, them, with, the, athenians, lost, the, thebans, were, surrounded, left, to, fight, alone, they, were, defeated, after, the, victory, at, chaeronea, philip, and, alexander, marched, unopposed, into, the, peloponnese, devastating, much, of, laconia, and, ejecting, the, spartans, from, various, parts, of, it, at, corinth, philip, established, a, hellenic, alliance, modelled, on, the, old, anti, persian, alliance, of, the, greco, persian, wars, which, included, most, greek, city, states, except, sparta, philip, was, then, named, hegemon, often, translated, as, supreme, commander, of, this, league, known, by, modern, scholars, as, the, league, of, corinth, and, announced, his, plans, to, attack, the, persian, empire, when, philip, returned, to, pella, he, fell, in, love, with, and, married, cleopatra, eurydice, in, 338, bc, the, niece, of, his, general, attalus, the, marriage, made, alexander, s, position, as, heir, less, secure, since, any, son, of, cleopatra, eurydice, would, be, a, fully, macedonian, heir, while, alexander, was, only, half, macedonian, during, the, wedding, banquet, a, drunken, attalus, publicly, prayed, to, the, gods, that, the, union, would, produce, a, legitimate, heir, at, the, wedding, of, cleopatra, whom, philip, fell, in, love, with, and, married, she, being, much, too, young, for, him, her, uncle, attalus, in, his, drink, desired, the, macedonians, would, implore, the, gods, to, give, them, a, lawful, successor, to, the, kingdom, by, his, niece, this, so, irritated, alexander, that, throwing, one, of, the, cups, at, his, head, you, villain, said, he, what, am, i, then, a, bastard, then, philip, taking, attalus, s, part, rose, up, and, would, have, run, his, son, through, but, by, good, fortune, for, them, both, either, his, over, hasty, rage, or, the, wine, he, had, drunk, made, his, foot, slip, so, that, he, fell, down, on, the, floor, at, which, alexander, reproachfully, insulted, him, see, there, said, he, the, man, who, makes, preparations, to, pass, out, of, europe, into, asia, overturned, in, passing, from, one, seat, to, another, in, 337, bc, alexander, fled, macedon, with, his, mother, dropping, her, off, with, her, brother, king, alexander, i, of, epirus, in, dodona, capital, of, the, molossians, he, continued, to, illyria, where, he, sought, refuge, with, one, or, more, illyrian, kings, perhaps, with, glaucias, and, was, treated, as, a, guest, despite, having, defeated, them, in, battle, a, few, years, before, however, it, appears, philip, never, intended, to, disown, his, politically, and, militarily, trained, son, accordingly, alexander, returned, to, macedon, after, six, months, due, to, the, efforts, of, a, family, friend, demaratus, who, mediated, between, the, two, parties, in, the, following, year, the, persian, satrap, governor, of, caria, pixodarus, offered, his, eldest, daughter, to, alexander, s, half, brother, philip, arrhidaeus, olympias, and, several, of, alexander, s, friends, suggested, this, showed, philip, intended, to, make, arrhidaeus, his, heir, alexander, reacted, by, sending, an, actor, thessalus, of, corinth, to, tell, pixodarus, that, he, should, not, offer, his, daughter, s, hand, to, an, illegitimate, son, but, instead, to, alexander, when, philip, heard, of, this, he, stopped, the, negotiations, and, scolded, alexander, for, wishing, to, marry, the, daughter, of, a, carian, explaining, that, he, wanted, a, better, bride, for, him, philip, exiled, four, of, alexander, s, friends, harpalus, nearchus, ptolemy, and, erigyius, and, had, the, corinthians, bring, thessalus, to, him, in, chains, in, the, 24th, day, of, the, macedonian, month, dios, which, probably, corresponds, to, 25, october, 336, bc, while, at, aegae, attending, the, wedding, of, his, daughter, cleopatra, to, olympias, s, brother, alexander, i, of, epirus, philip, was, assassinated, by, the, captain, of, his, bodyguards, pausanias, as, pausanias, tried, to, escape, he, tripped, over, a, vine, and, was, killed, by, his, pursuers, including, two, of, alexander, s, companions, perdiccas, and, leonnatus, alexander, was, proclaimed, king, on, the, spot, by, the, nobles, and, army, at, the, age, of, 20, alexander, began, his, reign, by, eliminating, potential, rivals, to, the, throne, he, had, his, cousin, the, former, amyntas, iv, executed, he, also, had, two, macedonian, princes, from, the, region, of, lyncestis, killed, for, having, been, involved, in, his, father, s, assassination, but, spared, a, third, alexander, lyncestes, olympias, had, cleopatra, eurydice, and, europa, her, daughter, by, philip, burned, alive, when, alexander, learned, about, this, he, was, furious, alexander, also, ordered, the, murder, of, attalus, who, was, in, command, of, the, advance, guard, of, the, army, in, asia, minor, and, cleopatra, s, uncle, attalus, was, at, that, time, corresponding, with, demosthenes, regarding, the, possibility, of, defecting, to, athens, attalus, also, had, severely, insulted, alexander, and, following, cleopatra, s, murder, alexander, may, have, considered, him, too, dangerous, to, be, left, alive, alexander, spared, arrhidaeus, who, was, by, all, accounts, mentally, disabled, possibly, as, a, result, of, poisoning, by, olympias, news, of, philip, s, death, roused, many, states, into, revolt, including, thebes, athens, thessaly, and, the, thracian, tribes, north, of, macedon, when, news, of, the, revolts, reached, alexander, he, responded, quickly, though, advised, to, use, diplomacy, alexander, mustered, 3, 000, macedonian, cavalry, and, rode, south, towards, thessaly, he, found, the, thessalian, army, occupying, the, pass, between, mount, olympus, and, mount, ossa, and, ordered, his, men, to, ride, over, mount, ossa, when, the, thessalians, awoke, the, next, day, they, found, alexander, in, their, rear, and, promptly, surrendered, adding, their, cavalry, to, alexander, s, force, he, then, continued, south, towards, the, peloponnese, alexander, stopped, at, thermopylae, where, he, was, recognized, as, the, leader, of, the, amphictyonic, league, before, heading, south, to, corinth, athens, sued, for, peace, and, alexander, pardoned, the, rebels, the, famous, encounter, between, alexander, and, diogenes, the, cynic, occurred, during, alexander, s, stay, in, corinth, when, alexander, asked, diogenes, what, he, could, do, for, him, the, philosopher, disdainfully, asked, alexander, to, stand, a, little, to, the, side, as, he, was, blocking, the, sunlight, this, reply, apparently, delighted, alexander, who, is, reported, to, have, said, but, verily, if, i, were, not, alexander, i, would, like, to, be, diogenes, at, corinth, alexander, took, the, title, of, hegemon, leader, and, like, philip, was, appointed, commander, for, the, coming, war, against, persia, he, also, received, news, of, a, thracian, uprising, before, crossing, to, asia, alexander, wanted, to, safeguard, his, northern, borders, in, the, spring, of, 335, bc, he, advanced, to, suppress, several, revolts, starting, from, amphipolis, he, travelled, east, into, the, country, of, the, independent, thracians, and, at, mount, haemus, the, macedonian, army, attacked, and, defeated, the, thracian, forces, manning, the, heights, the, macedonians, marched, into, the, country, of, the, triballi, and, defeated, their, army, near, the, lyginus, river, a, tributary, of, the, danube, alexander, then, marched, for, three, days, to, the, danube, encountering, the, getae, tribe, on, the, opposite, shore, crossing, the, river, at, night, he, surprised, them, and, forced, their, army, to, retreat, after, the, first, cavalry, skirmish, news, then, reached, alexander, that, the, illyrian, chieftain, cleitus, and, king, glaukias, of, the, taulantii, were, in, open, revolt, against, his, authority, marching, west, into, illyria, alexander, defeated, each, in, turn, forcing, the, two, rulers, to, flee, with, their, troops, with, these, victories, he, secured, his, northern, frontier, while, alexander, campaigned, north, the, thebans, and, athenians, rebelled, once, again, alexander, immediately, headed, south, while, the, other, cities, again, hesitated, thebes, decided, to, fight, the, theban, resistance, was, ineffective, and, alexander, razed, the, city, and, divided, its, territory, between, the, other, boeotian, cities, the, end, of, thebes, cowed, athens, leaving, all, of, greece,

and, illyria, he, showed, his, intent, to, conquer, the, entirety, of, the, persian, empire, by, throwing, a, spear, into, asian, soil, and, saying, he, accepted, asia, as, a, gift, from, the, gods,

his, mother, sisygambis, and, a, fabulous, treasure, he, offered, a, peace, treaty, that, included, the, lands, he, had, already, lost, and, a, ransom, of, 10, 000, talents, for, his, family, alexander, replied, that, since, he, was, now, king, of, asia, it, was, he, alone, who, decided, territorial, divisions, alexander, proceeded, to, take, possession, of, syria, and, most, of, the, coast, of, the, levant, in, the, following, year, 332, bc, he, was, forced, to, attack, tyre, which, he, captured, after, a, long, and, difficult, siege, the, men, of, military, age, were, massacred, and, the, women, and, children, sold, into, slavery, when, alexander, destroyed, tyre, most, of, the, towns, on, the, route, to, egypt, quickly, capitulated, however, alexander, was, met, with, resistance, at, gaza, the, stronghold, was, heavily, fortified, and, built, on, a, hill, requiring, a, siege, when, his, engineers, pointed, out, to, him, that, because, of, the, height, of, the, mound, it, would, be, impossible, this, encouraged, alexander, all, the, more, to, make, the, attempt, after, three, unsuccessful, assaults, the, stronghold, fell, but, not, before, alexander, had, received, a, serious, shoulder, wound, as, in, tyre, men, of, military, age, were, put, to, the, sword, and, the, women, and, children, were, sold, into, slavery, egypt, was, only, one, of, a, large, number, of, territories, taken, by, alexander, from, the, persians, after, his, trip, to, siwa, alexander, was, crowned, in, the, temple, of, ptah, at, memphis, it, appears, that, the, egyptian, people, did, not, find, it, disturbing, that, he, was, a, foreigner, nor, that, he, was, absent, for, virtually, his, entire, reign, alexander, restored, the, temples, neglected, by, the, persians, and, dedicated, new, monuments, to, the, egyptian, gods, in, the, temple, of, luxor, near, karnak, he, built, a, chapel, for, the, sacred, barge, during, his, brief, months, in, egypt, he, reformed, the, taxation, system, on, the, greek, models, and, organized, the, military, occupation, of, the, country, but, in, early, 331, bc, he, left, for, asia, in, pursuit, of, the, persians, alexander, advanced, on, egypt, in, later, 332, bc, where, he, was, regarded, as, a, liberator, to, legitimize, taking, power, and, be, recognized, as, the, descendant, of, the, long, line, of, pharaohs, alexander, made, sacrifices, to, the, gods, at, memphis, and, went, to, consult, the, famous, oracle, of, amun, ra, at, the, siwa, oasis, in, the, libyan, desert, at, which, he, was, pronounced, the, son, of, the, deity, amun, henceforth, alexander, often, referred, to, zeus, ammon, as, his, true, father, and, after, his, death, currency, depicted, him, adorned, with, horns, using, the, horns, of, ammon, as, a, symbol, of, his, divinity, the, greeks, interpreted, this, message, one, that, the, gods, addressed, to, all, pharaohs, as, a, prophecy, during, his, stay, in, egypt, he, founded, alexandria, which, would, become, the, prosperous, capital, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, after, his, death, control, of, egypt, passed, to, ptolemy, i, son, of, lagos, the, founder, of, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, 305, 30, bc, after, the, death, of, alexander, leaving, egypt, in, 331, bc, alexander, marched, eastward, into, achaemenid, assyria, in, upper, mesopotamia, now, northern, iraq, and, defeated, darius, again, at, the, battle, of, gaugamela, darius, once, more, fled, the, field, and, alexander, chased, him, as, far, as, arbela, gaugamela, would, be, the, final, and, decisive, encounter, between, the, two, darius, fled, over, the, mountains, to, ecbatana, modern, hamadan, while, alexander, captured, babylon, babylonian, astronomical, diaries, say, that, the, king, of, the, world, alexander, sent, his, scouts, with, a, message, to, the, people, of, babylon, before, entering, the, city, i, shall, not, enter, your, houses, from, babylon, alexander, went, to, susa, one, of, the, achaemenid, capitals, and, captured, its, treasury, he, sent, the, bulk, of, his, army, to, the, persian, ceremonial, capital, of, persepolis, via, the, persian, royal, road, alexander, himself, took, selected, troops, on, the, direct, route, to, the, city, he, then, stormed, the, pass, of, the, persian, gates, in, the, modern, zagros, mountains, which, had, been, blocked, by, a, persian, army, under, ariobarzanes, and, then, hurried, to, persepolis, before, its, garrison, could, loot, the, treasury, on, entering, persepolis, alexander, allowed, his, troops, to, loot, the, city, for, several, days, alexander, stayed, in, persepolis, for, five, months, during, his, stay, a, fire, broke, out, in, the, eastern, palace, of, xerxes, i, and, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, city, possible, causes, include, a, drunken, accident, or, deliberate, revenge, for, the, burning, of, the, acropolis, of, athens, during, the, second, persian, war, by, xerxes, plutarch, and, diodorus, allege, that, alexander, s, companion, the, hetaera, tha, s, instigated, and, started, the, fire, even, as, he, watched, the, city, burn, alexander, immediately, began, to, regret, his, decision, plutarch, claims, that, he, ordered, his, men, to, put, out, the, fires, but, the, flames, had, already, spread, to, most, of, the, city, curtius, claims, that, alexander, did, not, regret, his, decision, until, the, next, morning, plutarch, recounts, an, anecdote, in, which, alexander, pauses, and, talks, to, a, fallen, statue, of, xerxes, as, if, it, were, a, live, person, shall, i, pass, by, and, leave, you, lying, there, because, of, the, expeditions, you, led, against, greece, or, shall, i, set, you, up, again, because, of, your, magnanimity, and, your, virtues, in, other, respects, alexander, then, chased, darius, first, into, media, and, then, parthia, the, persian, king, no, longer, controlled, his, own, destiny, and, was, taken, prisoner, by, bessus, his, bactrian, satrap, and, kinsman, as, alexander, approached, bessus, had, his, men, fatally, stab, the, great, king, and, then, declared, himself, darius, s, successor, as, artaxerxes, v, before, retreating, into, central, asia, to, launch, a, guerrilla, campaign, against, alexander, alexander, buried, darius, s, remains, next, to, his, achaemenid, predecessors, in, a, regal, funeral, he, claimed, that, while, dying, darius, had, named, him, as, his, successor, to, the, achaemenid, throne, the, achaemenid, empire, is, normally, considered, to, have, fallen, with, darius, however, as, basic, forms, of, community, life, and, the, general, structure, of, government, were, maintained, and, resuscitated, by, alexander, under, his, own, rule, he, in, the, words, of, the, iranologist, pierre, briant, may, therefore, be, considered, to, have, acted, in, many, ways, as, the, last, of, the, achaemenids, alexander, viewed, bessus, as, a, usurper, and, set, out, to, defeat, him, this, campaign, initially, against, bessus, turned, into, a, grand, tour, of, central, asia, alexander, founded, a, series, of, new, cities, all, called, alexandria, including, modern, kandahar, in, afghanistan, and, alexandria, eschate, the, furthest, in, modern, tajikistan, the, campaign, took, alexander, through, media, parthia, aria, west, afghanistan, drangiana, arachosia, south, and, central, afghanistan, bactria, north, and, central, afghanistan, and, scythia, in, 329, bc, spitamenes, who, held, an, undefined, position, in, the, satrapy, of, sogdiana, betrayed, bessus, to, ptolemy, one, of, alexander, s, trusted, companions, and, bessus, was, executed, however, at, some, point, later, when, alexander, was, on, the, jaxartes, dealing, with, an, incursion, by, a, horse, nomad, army, spitamenes, raised, sogdiana, in, revolt, alexander, personally, defeated, the, scythians, at, the, battle, of, jaxartes, and, immediately, launched, a, campaign, against, spitamenes, defeating, him, in, the, battle, of, gabai, after, the, defeat, spitamenes, was, killed, by, his, own, men, who, then, sued, for, peace, during, this, time, alexander, adopted, some, elements, of, persian, dress, and, customs, at, his, court, notably, the, custom, of, proskynesis, either, a, symbolic, kissing, of, the, hand, or, prostration, on, the, ground, that, persians, showed, to, their, social, superiors, this, was, one, aspect, of, alexander, s, broad, strategy, aimed, at, securing, the, aid, and, support, of, the, iranian, upper, classes, the, greeks, however, regarded, the, gesture, of, proskynesis, as, the, province, of, deities, and, believed, that, alexander, meant, to, deify, himself, by, requiring, it, this, cost, him, the, sympathies, of, many, of, his, countrymen, and, he, eventually, abandoned, it, during, the, long, rule, of, the, achaemenids, the, elite, positions, in, many, segments, of, the, empire, including, the, central, government, the, army, and, the, many, satrapies, were, specifically, reserved, for, iranians, and, to, a, major, degree, persian, noblemen, the, latter, were, in, many, cases, additionally, connected, through, marriage, alliances, with, the, royal, achaemenid, family, this, created, a, problem, for, alexander, as, to, whether, he, had, to, make, use, of, the, various, segments, and, people, that, had, given, the, empire, its, solidity, and, unity, for, a, lengthy, period, of, time, pierre, briant, explains, that, alexander, realized, that, it, was, insufficient, to, merely, exploit, the, internal, contradictions, within, the, imperial, system, as, in, asia, minor, babylonia, or, egypt, he, also, had, to, re, create, a, central, government, with, or, without, the, support, of, the, iranians, as, early, as, 334, bc, he, demonstrated, awareness, of, this, when, he, challenged, incumbent, king, darius, iii, by, appropriating, the, main, elements, of, the, achaemenid, monarchy, s, ideology, particularly, the, theme, of, the, king, who, protects, the, lands, and, the, peasants, alexander, wrote, a, letter, in, 332, bc, to, darius, iii, wherein, he, argued, that, he, was, worthier, than, darius, to, succeed, to, the, achaemenid, throne, however, alexander, s, eventual, decision, to, burn, the, achaemenid, palace, at, persepolis, in, conjunction, with, the, major, rejection, and, opposition, of, the, entire, persian, people, made, it, impracticable, for, him, to, pose, himself, as, darius, legitimate, successor, against, bessus, artaxerxes, v, however, briant, adds, alexander, reasserted, his, claim, to, legitimacy, as, the, avenger, of, darius, iii, a, plot, against, his, life, was, revealed, and, one, of, his, officers, philotas, was, executed, for, failing, to, alert, alexander, the, death, of, the, son, necessitated, the, death, of, the, father, and, thus, parmenion, who, had, been, charged, with, guarding, the, treasury, at, ecbatana, was, assassinated, at, alexander, s, command, to, prevent, attempts, at, vengeance, most, infamously, alexander, personally, killed, the, man, who, had, saved, his, life, at, granicus, cleitus, the, black, during, a, violent, drunken, altercation, at, maracanda, modern, day, samarkand, in, uzbekistan, in, which, cleitus, accused, alexander, of, several, judgmental, mistakes, and, especially, of, having, forgotten, the, macedonian, ways, in, favour, of, a, corrupt, oriental, lifestyle, later, in, the, central, asian, campaign, a, second, plot, against, his, life, was, revealed, this, one, was, instigated, by, his, own, royal, pages, his, official, historian, callisthenes, of, olynthus, was, implicated, in, the, plot, and, in, the, anabasis, of, alexander, arrian, states, that, callisthenes, and, the, pages, were, then, tortured, on, the, rack, as, punishment, and, likely, died, soon, after, it, remains, unclear, if, callisthenes, was, actually, involved, in, the, plot, for, prior, to, his, accusation, he, had, fallen, out, of, favour, by, leading, the, opposition, to, the, attempt, to, introduce, proskynesis, when, alexander, set, out, for, asia, he, left, his, general, antipater, an, experienced, military, and, political, leader, and, part, of, philip, ii, s, old, guard, in, charge, of, macedon, alexander, s, sacking, of, thebes, ensured, that, greece, remained, quiet, during, his, absence, the, one, exception, was, a, call, to, arms, by, spartan, king, agis, iii, in, 331, bc, whom, antipater, defeated, and, killed, in, the, battle, of, megalopolis, antipater, referred, the, spartans, punishment, to, the, league, of, corinth, which, then, deferred, to, alexander, who, chose, to, pardon, them, there, was, also, considerable, friction, between, antipater, and, olympias, and, each, complained, to, alexander, about, the, other, in, general, greece, enjoyed, a, period, of, peace, and, prosperity, during, alexander, s, campaign, in, asia, alexander, sent, back, vast, sums, from, his, conquest, which, stimulated, the, economy, and, increased, trade, across, his, empire, however, alexander, s, constant, demands, for, troops, and, the, migration, of, macedonians, throughout, his, empire, depleted, macedon, s, strength, greatly, weakening, it, in, the, years, after, alexander, and, ultimately, led, to, its, subjugation, by, rome, after, the, third, macedonian, war, 171, 168, bc, the, conquest, by, philip, ii, of, pangaeum, and, then, of, the, island, of, thasos, between, 356, and, 342, bc, brought, rich, gold, and, silver, mines, under, macedonian, control, alexander, appears, to, have, introduced, a, new, coinage, in, cilicia, in, tarsus, after, the, battle, of, issus, in, 333, bc, which, went, on, to, become, the, main, coinage, of, the, empire, alexander, minted, gold, staters, silver, tetradrachms, and, drachims, and, various, fractional, bronze, coins, the, types, of, these, coins, remained, constant, in, his, empire, the, gold, series, had, the, head, of, athena, on, the, obverse, and, a, winged, nike, victory, on, the, reverse, the, silver, coinage, had, a, beardless, head, of, heracles, wearing, a, lionskin, headdress, on, the, obverse, and, zeus, aetophoros, eagle, bearer, enthroned, with, a, scepter, in, his, left, hand, on, the, reverse, there, are, both, greek, and, non, greek, aspects, to, this, design, heracles, and, zeus, were, important, deities, for, the, macedonians, with, heracles, considered, to, be, the, ancestor, of, the, temenid, dynasty, and, zeus, the, patron, of, the, main, macedonian, sanctuary, dium, the, lion, was, also, the, symbolic, animal, of, the, anatolian, god, sandas, worshipped, at, tarsus, the, reverse, design, of, alexander, s, tetradrachms, is, closely, modelled, on, the, depiction, of, the, god, baaltars, baal, of, tarsus, on, the, silver, staters, minted, at, tarsus, by, the, persian, satrap, mazaeus, before, alexander, s, conquest, alexander, did, not, attempt, to, impose, uniform, imperial, coinage, throughout, his, new, conquests, persian, coins, continued, to, circulate, in, all, the, satrapies, of, the, empire, after, the, death, of, spitamenes, and, his, marriage, to, roxana, raoxshna, in, old, iranian, to, cement, relations, with, his, new, satrapies, alexander, turned, to, the, indian, subcontinent, he, invited, the, chieftains, of, the, former, satrapy, of, gandhara, a, region, presently, straddling, eastern, afghanistan, and, northern, pakistan, to, come, to, him, and, submit, to, his, authority, omphis, indian, name, ambhi, the, ruler, of, taxila, whose, kingdom, extended, from, the, indus, to, the, hydaspes, jhelum, complied, but, the, chieftains, of, some, hill, clans, including, the, aspasioi, and, assakenoi, sections, of, the, kambojas, known, in, indian, texts, also, as, ashvayanas, and, ashvakayanas, refused, to, submit, ambhi, hastened, to, relieve, alexander, of, his, apprehension, and, met, him, with, valuable, presents, placing, himself, and, all, his, forces, at, his, disposal, alexander, not, only, returned, ambhi, his, title, and, the, gifts, but, he, also, presented, him, with, a, wardrobe, of, persian, robes, gold, and, silver, ornaments, 30, horses, and, 1, 000, talents, in, gold, alexander, was, emboldened, to, divide, his, forces, and, ambhi, assisted, hephaestion, and, perdiccas, in, constructing, a, bridge, over, the, indus, where, it, bends, at, hund, supplied, their, troops, with, provisions, and, he, received, alexander, and, his, whole, army, in, his, capital, city, of, taxila, with, every, demonstration, of, friendship, and, the, most, liberal, hospitality, on, the, subsequent, advance, of, the, macedonian, king, taxiles, accompanied, him, with, a, force, of, 5, 000, men, and, took, part, in, the, battle, of, the, hydaspes, after, that, victory, he, was, sent, by, alexander, in, pursuit, of, porus, to, whom, he, was, charged, to, offer, favourable, terms, but, narrowly, escaped, losing, his, life, at, the, hands, of, his, old, enemy, subsequently, the, two, rivals, were, reconciled, by, the, personal, mediation, of, alexander, taxiles, contributed, zealously, to, the, equipment, of, the, fleet, on, the, hydaspes, and, was, entrusted, by, alexander, with, the, government, of, the, whole, territory, between, that, river, and, the, indus, a, considerable, accession, of, power, was, granted, him, after, the, death, of, philip, son, of, machatas, and, he, was, allowed, to, retain, his, authority, at, the, death, of, alexander, himself, 323, bc, as, well, as, in, the, subsequent, partition, of, the, provinces, at, triparadisus, 321, bc, in, the, winter, of, 327, 326, bc, alexander, personally, led, a, campaign, against, the, aspasioi, of, the, kunar, valley, the, guraeans, of, the, guraeus, valley, and, the, assakenoi, of, the, swat, and, buner, valleys, a, fierce, contest, ensued, with, the, aspasioi, in, which, alexander, was, wounded, in, the, shoulder, by, a, dart, but, eventually, the, aspasioi, lost, alexander, then, faced, the, assakenoi, who, fought, against, him, from, the, strongholds, of, massaga, ora, and, aornos, the, fort, of, massaga, was, reduced, after, days, of, bloody, fighting, in, which, alexander, was, seriously, wounded, in, the, ankle, according, to, curtius, not, only, did, alexander, slaughter, the, entire, population, of, massaga, but, also, did, he, reduce, its, buildings, to, rubble, a, similar, slaughter, followed, at, ora, in, the, aftermath, of, massaga, and, ora, numerous, assakenians, fled, to, the, fortress, of, aornos, alexander, followed, close, behind, and, captured, the, strategic, hill, fort, after, four, bloody, days, after, aornos, alexander, crossed, the, indus, and, won, an, epic, battle, against, king, porus, who, ruled, a, region, lying, between, the, hydaspes, and, the, acesines, chenab, in, what, is, now, the, punjab, in, the, battle, of, the, hydaspes, in, 326, bc, alexander, was, impressed, by, porus, s, bravery, and, made, him, an, ally, he, appointed, porus, as, satrap, and, added, to, porus, s, territory, land, that, he, did, not, previously, own, towards, the, south, east, up, to, the, hyphasis, beas, choosing, a, local, helped, him, control, these, lands, that, were, distant, from, greece, alexander, founded, two, cities, on, opposite, sides, of, the, hydaspes, river, naming, one, bucephala, in, honour, of, his, horse, who, died, around, this, time, the, other, was, nicaea, victory, thought, to, be, located, at, the, site, of, modern, day, mong, punjab, philostratus, the, elder, in, the, life, of, apollonius, of, tyana, writes, that, in, the, army, of, porus, there, was, an, elephant, who, fought, bravely, against, alexander, s, army, and, alexander, dedicated, it, to, the, helios, sun, and, named, it, ajax, because, he, thought, that, such, a, great, animal, deserved, a, great, name, the, elephant, had, gold, rings, around, its, tusks, and, an, inscription, was, on, them, written, in, greek, alexander, the, son, of, zeus, dedicates, ajax, to, the, helios, east, of, porus, s, kingdom, near, the, ganges, river, was, the, nanda, empire, of, magadha, and, further, east, the, gangaridai, empire, of, bengal, region, of, the, indian, subcontinent, fearing, the, prospect, of, facing, other, large, armies, and, exhausted, by, years, of, campaigning, alexander, s, army, mutinied, at, the, hyphasis, river, beas, refusing, to, march, farther, east, this, river, thus, marks, the, easternmost, extent, of, alexander, s, conquests, as, for, the, macedonians, however, their, struggle, with, porus, blunted, their, courage, and, stayed, their, further, advance, into, india, for, having, had, all, they, could, do, to, repulse, an, enemy, who, mustered, only, twenty, thousand, infantry, and, two, thousand, horse, they, violently, opposed, alexander, when, he, insisted, on, crossing, the, river, ganges, also, the, width, of, which, as, they, learned, was, thirty, two, furlongs, its, depth, one, hundred, fathoms, while, its, banks, on, the, further, side, were, covered, with, multitudes, of, men, at, arms, and, horsemen, and, elephants, for, they, were, told, that, the, kings, of, the, ganderites, and, praesii, were, awaiting, them, with, eighty, thousand, horsemen, two, hundred, thousand, footmen, eight, thousand, chariots, and, six, thousand, war, elephants, alexander, tried, to, persuade, his, soldiers, to, march, farther, but, his, general, coenus, pleaded, with, him, to, change, his, opinion, and, return, the, men, he, said, longed, to, again, see, their, parents, their, wives, and, children, their, homeland, alexander, eventually, agreed, and, turned, south, marching, along, the, indus, along, the, way, his, army, conquered, the, malhi, in, modern, day, multan, and, other, indian, tribes, while, besieging, the, mallian, citadel, alexander, suffered, a, near, fatal, injury, when, an, arrow, penetrated, his, armor, and, entered, his, lung, alexander, sent, much, of, his, army, to, carmania, modern, southern, iran, with, general, craterus, and, commissioned, a, fleet, to, explore, the, persian, gulf, shore, under, his, admiral, nearchus, while, he, led, the, rest, back, to, persia, through, the, more, difficult, southern, route, along, the, gedrosian, desert, and, makran, alexander, reached, susa, in, 324, bc, but, not, before, losing, many, men, to, the, harsh, desert, discovering, that, many, of, his, satraps, and, military, governors, had, misbehaved, in, his, absence, alexander, executed, several, of, them, as, examples, on, his, way, to, susa, as, a, gesture, of, thanks, he, paid, off, the, debts, of, his, soldiers, and, announced, that, he, would, send, over, aged, and, disabled, veterans, back, to, macedon, led, by, craterus, his, troops, misunderstood, his, intention, and, mutinied, at, the, town, of, opis, they, refused, to, be, sent, away, and, criticized, his, adoption, of, persian, customs, and, dress, and, the, introduction, of, persian, officers, and, soldiers, into, macedonian, units, after, three, days, unable, to, persuade, his, men, to, back, down, alexander, gave, persians, command, posts, in, the, army, and, conferred, macedonian, military, titles, upon, persian, units, the, macedonians, quickly, begged, forgiveness, which, alexander, accepted, and, held, a, great, banquet, with, several, thousand, of, his, men, in, an, attempt, to, craft, a, lasting, harmony, between, his, macedonian, and, persian, subjects, alexander, held, a, mass, marriage, of, his, senior, officers, to, persian, and, other, noblewomen, at, susa, but, few, of, those, marriages, seem, to, have, lasted, much, beyond, a, year, meanwhile, upon, his, return, to, persia, alexander, learned, that, guards, of, the, tomb, of, cyrus, the, great, in, pasargadae, had, desecrated, it, and, swiftly, executed, them, alexander, admired, cyrus, the, great, from, an, early, age, reading, xenophon, s, cyropaedia, which, described, cyrus, s, heroism, in, battle, and, governance, as, a, king, and, legislator, during, his, visit, to, pasargadae, alexander, ordered, his, architect, aristobulus, to, decorate, the, interior, of, the, sepulchral, chamber, of, cyrus, s, tomb, afterwards, alexander, travelled, to, ecbatana, to, retrieve, the, bulk, of, the, persian, treasure, there, his, closest, friend, hephaestion, died, of, illness, or, poisoning, hephaestion, s, death, devastated, alexander, and, he, ordered, the, preparation, of, an, expensive, funeral, pyre, in, babylon, along, with, a, decree, for, public, mourning, back, in, babylon, alexander, planned, a, series, of, new, campaigns, beginning, with, an, invasion, of, arabia, but, he, would, not, have, a, chance, to, realize, them, as, he, died, shortly, after, hephaestion, on, the, evening, of, 29, may, alexander, organized, a, banquet, for, his, army, to, celebrate, the, end, of, the, campaign, of, india, and, the, onset, of, the, invasion, of, the, arabian, peninsula, there, is, a, tradition, that, they, would, only, start, serious, drinking, after, everyone, was, done, with, their, meals, but, the, wine, was, usually, heavily, watered, before, his, death, someone, asked, alexander, on, who, would, be, his, designated, successor, should, he, die, he, responded, to, the, strongest, one, he, may, have, also, added, that, there, would, be, funeral, games, to, be, played, after, his, death, on, either, 10, or, 11, june, 323, bc, alexander, died, in, the, palace, of, nebuchadnezzar, ii, in, babylon, at, age, 32, there, are, two, different, versions, of, alexander, s, death, differing, slightly, in, details, plutarch, s, account, is, that, roughly, 14, days, before, his, death, alexander, entertained, admiral, nearchus, and, spent, the, night, and, next, day, drinking, with, medius, of, larissa, alexander, developed, a, fever, which, worsened, until, he, was, unable, to, speak, the, common, soldiers, anxious, about, his, health, were, granted, the, right, to, file, past, him, as, he, silently, waved, at, them, in, the, second, account, diodorus, recounts, that, alexander, was, struck, with, pain, after, downing, a, large, bowl, of, unmixed, wine, in, honour, of, heracles, followed, by, 11, days, of, weakness, he, did, not, develop, a, fever, instead, dying, after, some, agony, arrian, also, mentioned, this, as, an, alternative, but, plutarch, specifically, denied, this, claim, given, the, propensity, of, the, macedonian, aristocracy, to, assassination, foul, play, featured, in, multiple, accounts, of, his, death, diodorus, plutarch, arrian, and, justin, all, mentioned, the, theory, that, alexander, was, poisoned, justin, stated, that, alexander, was, the, victim, of, a, poisoning, conspiracy, plutarch, dismissed, it, as, a, fabrication, while, both, diodorus, and, arrian, noted, that, they, mentioned, it, only, for, the, sake, of, completeness, the, accounts, were, nevertheless, fairly, consistent, in, designating, antipater, recently, removed, as, macedonian, viceroy, replaced, by, craterus, as, the, head, of, the, alleged, plot, perhaps, taking, his, summons, to, babylon, as, a, death, sentence, and, having, seen, the, fate, of, parmenion, and, philotas, antipater, purportedly, arranged, for, alexander, to, be, poisoned, by, his, son, iollas, who, was, alexander, s, wine, pourer, there, was, even, a, suggestion, that, aristotle, may, have, participated, the, strongest, argument, against, the, poison, theory, is, the, fact, that, twelve, days, passed, between, the, start, of, his, illness, and, his, death, such, long, acting, poisons, were, probably, not, available, however, in, a, 2003, bbc, documentary, investigating, the, death, of, alexander, leo, schep, from, the, new, zealand, national, poisons, centre, proposed, that, the, plant, white, hellebore, veratrum, album, which, was, known, in, antiquity, may, have, been, used, to, poison, alexander, in, a, 2014, manuscript, in, the, journal, clinical, toxicology, schep, suggested, alexander, s, wine, was, spiked, with, veratrum, album, and, that, this, would, produce, poisoning, symptoms, that, match, the, course, of, events, described, in, the, alexander, romance, veratrum, album, poisoning, can, have, a, prolonged, course, and, it, was, suggested, that, if, alexander, was, poisoned, veratrum, album, offers, the, most, plausible, cause, another, poisoning, explanation, put, forward, in, 2010, proposed, that, the, circumstances, of, his, death, were, compatible, with, poisoning, by, water, of, the, river, styx, modern, day, mavroneri, in, arcadia, greece, that, contained, calicheamicin, a, dangerous, compound, produced, by, bacteria, several, natural, causes, diseases, have, been, suggested, including, malaria, and, typhoid, fever, a, 1998, article, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, attributed, his, death, to, typhoid, fever, complicated, by, bowel, perforation, and, ascending, paralysis, a, 2004, analysis, suggested, pyogenic, infectious, spondylitis, or, meningitis, other, illnesses, fit, the, symptoms, including, acute, pancreatitis, west, nile, virus, and, guillain, barr, syndrome, natural, cause, theories, also, tend, to, emphasize, that, alexander, s, health, may, have, been, in, general, decline, after, years, of, heavy, drinking, and, severe, wounds, the, anguish, that, alexander, felt, after, hephaestion, s, death, may, also, have, contributed, to, his, declining, health, alexander, s, body, was, laid, in, a, gold, anthropoid, sarcophagus, that, was, filled, with, honey, which, was, in, turn, placed, in, a, gold, casket, according, to, aelian, a, seer, called, aristander, foretold, that, the, land, where, alexander, was, laid, to, rest, would, be, happy, and, unvanquishable, forever, perhaps, more, likely, the, successors, may, have, seen, possession, of, the, body, as, a, symbol, of, legitimacy, since, burying, the, prior, king, was, a, royal, prerogative, while, alexander, s, funeral, cortege, was, on, its, way, to, macedon, ptolemy, seized, it, and, took, it, temporarily, to, memphis, his, successor, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, transferred, the, sarcophagus, to, alexandria, where, it, remained, until, at, least, late, antiquity, ptolemy, ix, lathyros, one, of, ptolemy, s, final, successors, replaced, alexander, s, sarcophagus, with, a, glass, one, so, he, could, convert, the, original, to, coinage, the, 2014, discovery, of, an, enormous, tomb, in, northern, greece, at, amphipolis, dating, from, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, has, given, rise, to, speculation, that, its, original, intent, was, to, be, the, burial, place, of, alexander, this, would, fit, with, the, intended, destination, of, alexander, s, funeral, cortege, however, the, memorial, was, found, to, be, dedicated, to, the, dearest, friend, of, alexander, the, great, hephaestion, pompey, julius, caesar, and, augustus, all, visited, the, tomb, in, alexandria, where, augustus, allegedly, accidentally, knocked, the, nose, off, caligula, was, said, to, have, taken, alexander, s, breastplate, from, the, tomb, for, his, own, use, around, ad, 200, emperor, septimius, severus, closed, alexander, s, tomb, to, the, public, his, son, and, successor, caracalla, a, great, admirer, visited, the, tomb, during, his, own, reign, after, this, details, on, the, fate, of, the, tomb, are, hazy, the, so, called, alexander, sarcophagus, discovered, near, sidon, and, now, in, the, istanbul, archaeology, museum, is, so, named, not, because, it, was, thought, to, have, contained, alexander, s, remains, but, because, its, bas, reliefs, depict, alexander, and, his, companions, fighting, the, persians, and, hunting, it, was, originally, thought, to, have, been, the, sarcophagus, of, abdalonymus, died, 311, bc, the, king, of, sidon, appointed, by, alexander, immediately, following, the, battle, of, issus, in, 331, however, in, 1969, it, was, suggested, by, karl, schefold, that, it, may, date, from, earlier, than, abdalonymus, s, death, demades, likened, the, macedonian, army, after, the, death, of, alexander, to, the, blinded, cyclops, due, to, the, many, random, and, disorderly, movements, that, it, made, in, addition, leosthenes, also, likened, the, anarchy, between, the, generals, after, alexander, s, death, to, the, blinded, cyclops, who, after, he, had, lost, his, eye, went, feeling, and, groping, about, with, his, hands, before, him, not, knowing, where, to, lay, them, alexander, s, death, was, so, sudden, that, when, reports, of, his, death, reached, greece, they, were, not, immediately, believed, alexander, had, no, obvious, or, legitimate, heir, his, son, alexander, iv, by, roxane, being, born, after, alexander, s, death, according, to, diodorus, alexander, s, companions, asked, him, on, his, deathbed, to, whom, he, bequeathed, his, kingdom, his, laconic, reply, was, t, i, kratist, i, to, the, strongest, another, theory, is, that, his, successors, wilfully, or, erroneously, misheard, t, i, krater, i, to, craterus, the, general, leading, his, macedonian, troops, home, and, newly, entrusted, with, the, regency, of, macedonia, arrian, and, plutarch, claimed, that, alexander, was, speechless, by, this, time, implying, that, this, was, an, apocryphal, story, diodorus, curtius, and, justin, offered, the, more, plausible, story, that, alexander, passed, his, signet, ring, to, perdiccas, a, bodyguard, and, leader, of, the, companion, cavalry, in, front, of, witnesses, thereby, nominating, him, perdiccas, initially, did, not, claim, power, instead, suggesting, that, roxane, s, baby, would, be, king, if, male, with, himself, craterus, leonnatus, and, antipater, as, guardians, however, the, infantry, under, the, command, of, meleager, rejected, this, arrangement, since, they, had, been, excluded, from, the, discussion, instead, they, supported, alexander, s, half, brother, philip, arrhidaeus, eventually, the, two, sides, reconciled, and, after, the, birth, of, alexander, iv, he, and, philip, iii, were, appointed, joint, kings, albeit, in, name, only, dissension, and, rivalry, soon, affected, the, macedonians, the, satrapies, handed, out, by, perdiccas, at, the, partition, of, babylon, became, power, bases, each, general, used, to, bid, for, power, after, the, assassination, of, perdiccas, in, 321, bc, macedonian, unity, collapsed, and, 40, years, of, war, between, the, successors, diadochi, ensued, before, the, hellenistic, world, settled, into, three, stable, power, blocs, ptolemaic, egypt, seleucid, syria, and, east, and, antigonid, macedonia, in, the, process, both, alexander, iv, and, philip, iii, were, murdered, diodorus, stated, that, alexander, had, given, detailed, written, instructions, to, craterus, some, time, before, his, death, which, are, known, as, alexander, s, last, plans, craterus, started, to, carry, out, alexander, s, commands, but, the, successors, chose, not, to, further, implement, them, on, the, grounds, they, were, impractical, and, extravagant, furthermore, perdiccas, had, read, the, notebooks, containing, alexander, s, last, plans, to, the, macedonian, troops, in, babylon, who, voted, not, to, carry, them, out, according, to, diodorus, alexander, s, last, plans, called, for, military, expansion, into, the, southern, and, western, mediterranean, monumental, constructions, and, the, intermixing, of, eastern, and, western, populations, it, included, the, enormous, scale, of, these, plans, has, led, many, scholars, to, doubt, their, historicity, ernst, badian, argued, that, they, were, exaggerated, by, perdiccas, in, order, to, ensure, that, the, macedonian, troops, voted, not, to, carry, them, out, other, scholars, have, proposed, that, they, were, invented, by, later, authors, within, the, tradition, of, the, alexander, romance, alexander, perhaps, earned, the, epithet, the, great, due, to, his, unparalleled, success, as, a, military, commander, he, never, lost, a, battle, despite, typically, being, outnumbered, this, was, due, to, use, of, terrain, phalanx, and, cavalry, tactics, bold, strategy, and, the, fierce, loyalty, of, his, troops, the, macedonian, phalanx, armed, with, the, sarissa, a, spear, 6, metres, 20, ft, long, had, been, developed, and, perfected, by, philip, ii, through, rigorous, training, and, alexander, used, its, speed, and, manoeuvrability, to, great, effect, against, larger, but, more, disparate, persian, forces, alexander, also, recognized, the, potential, for, disunity, among, his, diverse, army, which, employed, various, languages, and, weapons, he, overcame, this, by, being, personally, involved, in, battle, in, the, manner, of, a, macedonian, king, in, his, first, battle, in, asia, at, granicus, alexander, used, only, a, small, part, of, his, forces, perhaps, 13, 000, infantry, with, 5, 000, cavalry, against, a, much, larger, persian, force, of, 40, 000, alexander, placed, the, phalanx, at, the, center, and, cavalry, and, archers, on, the, wings, so, that, his, line, matched, the, length, of, the, persian, cavalry, line, about, 3, km, 1, 86, mi, by, contrast, the, persian, infantry, was, stationed, behind, its, cavalry, this, ensured, that, alexander, would, not, be, outflanked, while, his, phalanx, armed, with, long, pikes, had, a, considerable, advantage, over, the, persians, scimitars, and, javelins, macedonian, losses, were, negligible, compared, to, those, of, the, persians, at, issus, in, 333, bc, his, first, confrontation, with, darius, he, used, the, same, deployment, and, again, the, central, phalanx, pushed, through, alexander, personally, led, the, charge, in, the, center, routing, the, opposing, army, at, the, decisive, encounter, with, darius, at, gaugamela, darius, equipped, his, chariots, with, scythes, on, the, wheels, to, break, up, the, phalanx, and, equipped, his, cavalry, with, pikes, alexander, arranged, a, double, phalanx, with, the, center, advancing, at, an, angle, parting, when, the, chariots, bore, down, and, then, reforming, the, advance, was, successful, and, broke, darius, s, center, causing, the, latter, to, flee, once, again, when, faced, with, opponents, who, used, unfamiliar, fighting, techniques, such, as, in, central, asia, and, india, alexander, adapted, his, forces, to, his, opponents, style, thus, in, bactria, and, sogdiana, alexander, successfully, used, his, javelin, throwers, and, archers, to, prevent, outflanking, movements, while, massing, his, cavalry, at, the, center, in, india, confronted, by, porus, s, elephant, corps, the, macedonians, opened, their, ranks, to, envelop, the, elephants, and, used, their, sarissas, to, strike, upwards, and, dislodge, the, elephants, handlers, historical, sources, frequently, give, conflicting, accounts, of, alexander, s, appearance, and, the, earliest, sources, are, the, most, scant, in, their, detail, during, his, lifetime, alexander, carefully, curated, his, image, by, commissioning, works, from, famous, and, great, artists, of, the, time, this, included, commissioning, sculptures, by, lysippos, paintings, by, apelles, and, gem, engravings, by, pyrgoteles, ancient, authors, recorded, that, alexander, was, so, pleased, with, portraits, of, himself, created, by, lysippos, that, he, forbade, other, sculptors, from, crafting, his, image, scholars, today, however, find, the, claim, dubious, nevertheless, andrew, stewart, highlights, the, fact, that, artistic, portraits, not, least, because, of, who, they, are, commissioned, by, are, always, partisan, and, that, artistic, portrayals, of, alexander, seek, to, legitimize, him, or, by, extension, his, successors, to, interpret, him, to, their, audiences, to, answer, their, critiques, and, to, persuade, them, of, his, greatness, and, thus, should, be, considered, within, a, framework, of, praise, and, blame, in, the, same, way, sources, such, as, praise, poetry, are, despite, those, caveats, lysippos, s, sculpture, famous, for, its, naturalism, as, opposed, to, a, stiffer, more, static, pose, is, thought, to, be, the, most, faithful, depiction, curtius, rufus, a, roman, historian, from, the, first, century, ad, who, wrote, the, histories, of, alexander, the, great, gives, this, account, of, alexander, sitting, on, the, throne, of, darius, iii, then, alexander, seating, himself, on, the, royal, throne, which, was, far, too, high, for, his, bodily, stature, therefore, since, his, feet, did, not, reach, its, lowest, step, one, of, the, royal, pages, placed, a, table, under, his, feet, both, curtius, and, diodorus, report, a, story, that, when, darius, iii, s, mother, sisygambis, first, met, alexander, and, hephaestion, she, assumed, that, the, latter, was, alexander, because, he, was, the, taller, and, more, handsome, of, the, two, the, greek, biographer, plutarch, c, 45, c, 120, ad, discusses, the, accuracy, of, his, depictions, the, outward, appearance, of, alexander, is, best, represented, by, the, statues, of, him, which, lysippus, made, and, it, was, by, this, artist, alone, that, alexander, himself, thought, it, fit, that, he, should, be, modelled, for, those, peculiarities, which, many, of, his, successors, and, friends, afterwards, tried, to, imitate, namely, the, poise, of, the, neck, which, was, bent, slightly, to, the, left, and, the, melting, glance, of, his, eyes, this, artist, has, accurately, observed, apelles, however, in, painting, him, as, wielder, of, the, thunder, bolt, did, not, reproduce, his, complexion, but, made, it, too, dark, and, swarthy, whereas, he, was, of, a, fair, colour, as, they, say, and, his, fairness, passed, into, ruddiness, on, his, breast, particularly, and, in, his, face, moreover, that, a, very, pleasant, odour, exhaled, from, his, skin, and, that, there, was, a, fragrance, about, his, mouth, and, all, his, flesh, so, that, his, garments, were, filled, with, it, this, we, have, read, in, the, memoirs, of, aristoxenus, historians, have, understood, the, detail, of, the, pleasant, fragrance, attributed, to, alexander, as, stemming, from, a, belief, in, ancient, greece, that, pleasant, scents, are, characteristic, of, gods, and, heroes, the, alexander, mosaic, and, contemporary, coins, portray, alexander, with, a, straight, nose, a, slightly, protruding, jaw, full, lips, and, eyes, deep, set, beneath, a, strongly, pronounced, forehead, he, is, also, described, as, having, a, slight, upward, tilt, of, his, head, to, the, left, the, ancient, historian, aelian, c, 175, c, 235, ad, in, his, varia, historia, 12, 14, describes, alexander, s, hair, color, as, xanth, n, which, at, the, time, could, mean, yellowish, brownish, or, reddish, it, is, sometimes, claimed, that, alexander, had, one, blue, and, one, brown, eye, referring, to, the, alexander, romance, which, is, however, a, fictional, account, that, also, claims, alexander, had, sharp, teeth, like, fangs, and, did, not, look, like, philip, or, olympias, reconstruction, based, on, remaining, traces, of, paint, of, the, original, polychromy, on, his, sarcophagus, indicates, that, he, was, depicted, with, brown, eyes, and, chestnut, brown, hair, both, of, alexander, s, parents, encouraged, his, ambitions, his, father, philip, was, probably, alexander, s, most, immediate, and, influential, role, model, as, the, young, alexander, watched, him, campaign, practically, every, year, winning, victory, after, victory, while, ignoring, severe, wounds, alexander, s, relationship, with, his, father, forged, the, competitive, side, of, his, personality, he, had, a, need, to, outdo, his, father, illustrated, by, his, reckless, behavior, in, battle, while, alexander, worried, that, his, father, would, leave, him, no, great, or, brilliant, achievement, to, be, displayed, to, the, world, he, also, downplayed, his, father, s, achievements, to, his, companions, alexander, s, mother, olympia, similarly, had, huge, ambitions, and, encouraged, her, son, to, believe, it, was, his, destiny, to, conquer, the, persian, empire, she, instilled, a, sense, of, destiny, in, him, and, plutarch, tells, how, his, ambition, kept, his, spirit, serious, and, lofty, in, advance, of, his, years, according, to, plutarch, alexander, also, had, a, violent, temper, and, rash, impulsive, nature, which, could, influence, his, decision, making, although, alexander, was, stubborn, and, did, not, respond, well, to, orders, from, his, father, he, was, open, to, reasoned, debate, he, had, a, calmer, side, perceptive, logical, and, calculating, he, had, a, great, desire, for, knowledge, a, love, for, philosophy, and, was, an, avid, reader, this, was, no, doubt, in, part, due, to, aristotle, s, tutelage, alexander, was, intelligent, and, quick, to, learn, his, intelligent, and, rational, side, was, amply, demonstrated, by, his, ability, and, success, as, a, general, he, had, great, self, restraint, in, pleasures, of, the, body, in, contrast, with, his, lack, of, self, control, with, alcohol, alexander, was, erudite, and, patronized, both, arts, and, sciences, however, he, had, little, interest, in, sports, or, the, olympic, games, unlike, his, father, seeking, only, the, homeric, ideals, of, honour, tim, and, glory, kudos, he, had, great, charisma, and, force, of, personality, characteristics, which, made, him, a, great, leader, his, unique, abilities, were, further, demonstrated, by, the, inability, of, any, of, his, generals, to, unite, macedonia, and, retain, the, empire, after, his, death, only, alexander, had, the, ability, to, do, so, during, his, final, years, and, especially, after, the, death, of, hephaestion, alexander, began, to, exhibit, signs, of, megalomania, and, paranoia, his, extraordinary, achievements, coupled, with, his, own, ineffable, sense, of, destiny, and, the, flattery, of, his, companions, may, have, combined, to, produce, this, effect, his, delusions, of, grandeur, are, readily, visible, in, his, will, and, in, his, desire, to, conquer, the, world, in, as, much, as, he, is, by, various, sources, described, as, having, boundless, ambition, an, epithet, the, meaning, of, which, has, descended, into, a, historical, clich, he, appears, to, have, believed, himself, a, deity, or, at, least, sought, to, deify, himself, olympias, always, insisted, to, him, that, he, was, the, son, of, zeus, a, theory, apparently, confirmed, to, him, by, the, oracle, of, amun, at, siwa, he, began, to, identify, himself, as, the, son, of, zeus, ammon, alexander, adopted, elements, of, persian, dress, and, customs, at, court, notably, proskynesis, which, was, one, aspect, of, alexander, s, broad, strategy, aimed, at, securing, the, aid, and, support, of, the, iranian, upper, classes, however, the, practise, of, proskynesis, was, disapproved, by, the, macedonians, and, they, were, unwilling, to, perform, it, this, behaviour, cost, him, the, sympathies, of, many, of, his, countrymen, alexander, also, was, a, pragmatic, ruler, who, understood, the, difficulties, of, ruling, culturally, disparate, peoples, many, of, whom, lived, in, societies, where, the, king, was, treated, as, divine, thus, rather, than, megalomania, his, behaviour, may, have, been, a, practical, attempt, at, strengthening, his, rule, and, keeping, his, empire, together, alexander, married, three, times, roxana, daughter, of, the, sogdian, nobleman, oxyartes, of, bactria, out, of, love, and, the, persian, princesses, stateira, and, parysatis, the, former, a, daughter, of, darius, iii, and, the, latter, a, daughter, of, artaxerxes, iii, for, political, reasons, he, apparently, had, two, sons, alexander, iv, of, macedon, by, roxana, and, possibly, heracles, of, macedon, from, his, mistress, barsine, he, lost, another, child, when, roxana, miscarried, at, babylon, alexander, also, had, a, close, relationship, with, his, friend, general, and, bodyguard, hephaestion, the, son, of, a, macedonian, noble, hephaestion, s, death, devastated, alexander, this, event, may, have, contributed, to, alexander, s, failing, health, and, detached, mental, state, during, his, final, months, alexander, s, sexuality, has, been, the, subject, of, speculation, and, controversy, in, modern, times, the, roman, era, writer, athenaeus, says, based, on, the, scholar, dicaearchus, who, was, alexander, s, contemporary, that, the, king, was, quite, excessively, keen, on, boys, and, that, alexander, kissed, the, eunuch, bagoas, in, public, this, episode, is, also, told, by, plutarch, probably, based, on, the, same, source, none, of, alexander, s, contemporaries, however, are, known, to, have, explicitly, described, alexander, s, relationship, with, hephaestion, as, sexual, though, the, pair, was, often, compared, to, achilles, and, patroclus, who, are, often, interpreted, as, a, couple, aelian, writes, of, alexander, s, visit, to, troy, where, alexander, garlanded, the, tomb, of, achilles, and, hephaestion, that, of, patroclus, the, latter, hinting, that, he, was, a, beloved, of, alexander, in, just, the, same, way, as, patroclus, was, of, achilles, some, modern, historians, e, g, robin, lane, fox, believe, not, only, that, alexander, s, youthful, relationship, with, hephaestion, was, sexual, but, also, that, their, sexual, contacts, may, have, continued, into, adulthood, which, went, against, the, social, norms, of, at, least, some, greek, cities, such, as, athens, though, some, modern, researchers, have, tentatively, proposed, that, macedonia, or, at, least, the, macedonian, court, may, have, been, more, tolerant, of, homosexuality, between, adults, peter, green, argues, that, there, is, little, evidence, in, ancient, sources, that, alexander, had, much, sexual, interest, in, women, he, did, not, produce, an, heir, until, the, very, end, of, his, life, however, ogden, calculates, that, alexander, who, impregnated, his, partners, thrice, in, eight, years, had, a, higher, matrimonial, record, than, his, father, at, the, same, age, two, of, these, pregnancies, stateira, s, and, barsine, s, are, of, dubious, legitimacy, according, to, diodorus, siculus, alexander, accumulated, a, harem, in, the, style, of, persian, kings, but, he, used, it, rather, sparingly, not, wishing, to, offend, the, macedonians, showing, great, self, control, in, pleasures, of, the, body, nevertheless, plutarch, described, how, alexander, was, infatuated, by, roxana, while, complimenting, him, on, not, forcing, himself, on, her, green, suggested, that, in, the, context, of, the, period, alexander, formed, quite, strong, friendships, with, women, including, ada, of, caria, who, adopted, him, and, even, darius, s, mother, sisygambis, who, supposedly, died, from, grief, upon, hearing, of, alexander, s, death, alexander, s, legacy, extended, beyond, his, military, conquests, and, his, reign, marked, a, turning, point, in, european, and, asian, history, his, campaigns, greatly, increased, contacts, and, trade, between, east, and, west, and, vast, areas, to, the, east, were, significantly, exposed, to, greek, civilization, and, influence, some, of, the, cities, he, founded, became, major, cultural, centers, many, surviving, into, the, 21st, century, his, chroniclers, recorded, valuable, information, about, the, areas, through, which, he, marched, while, the, greeks, themselves, got, a, sense, of, belonging, to, a, world, beyond, the, mediterranean, alexander, s, most, immediate, legacy, was, the, introduction, of, macedonian, rule, to, huge, new, swathes, of, asia, at, the, time, of, his, death, alexander, s, empire, covered, some, 5, 200, 000, km, 2, 2, 000, 000, sq, mi, and, was, the, largest, state, of, its, time, many, of, these, areas, remained, in, macedonian, hands, or, under, greek, influence, for, the, next, 200, 300, years, the, successor, states, that, emerged, were, at, least, initially, dominant, forces, and, these, 300, years, are, often, referred, to, as, the, hellenistic, period, the, eastern, borders, of, alexander, s, empire, began, to, collapse, even, during, his, lifetime, however, the, power, vacuum, he, left, in, the, northwest, of, the, indian, subcontinent, directly, gave, rise, to, one, of, the, most, powerful, indian, dynasties, in, history, the, maurya, empire, taking, advantage, of, this, power, vacuum, chandragupta, maurya, referred, to, in, greek, sources, as, sandrokottos, of, relatively, humble, origin, took, control, of, the, punjab, and, with, that, power, base, proceeded, to, conquer, the, nanda, empire, over, the, course, of, his, conquests, alexander, founded, many, cities, that, bore, his, name, most, of, them, east, of, the, tigris, the, first, and, greatest, was, alexandria, in, egypt, which, would, become, one, of, the, leading, mediterranean, cities, the, cities, locations, reflected, trade, routes, as, well, as, defensive, positions, at, first, the, cities, must, have, been, inhospitable, little, more, than, defensive, garrisons, following, alexander, s, death, many, greeks, who, had, settled, there, tried, to, return, to, greece, however, a, century, or, so, after, alexander, s, death, many, of, the, alexandrias, were, thriving, with, elaborate, public, buildings, and, substantial, populations, that, included, both, greek, and, local, peoples, in, 334, bc, alexander, the, great, donated, funds, for, the, completion, of, the, new, temple, of, athena, polias, in, priene, in, modern, day, western, turkey, an, inscription, from, the, temple, now, housed, in, the, british, museum, declares, king, alexander, dedicated, to, athena, polias, this, inscription, is, one, of, the, few, independent, archaeological, discoveries, confirming, an, episode, from, alexander, s, life, the, temple, was, designed, by, pytheos, one, of, the, architects, of, the, mausoleum, at, halicarnassus, libanius, wrote, that, alexander, founded, the, temple, of, zeus, bottiaios, ancient, greek, in, the, place, where, later, the, city, of, antioch, was, built, suda, wrote, that, alexander, built, a, big, temple, to, sarapis, in, 2023, british, museum, experts, have, suggested, the, possibility, that, a, greek, temple, at, girsu, in, iraq, was, founded, by, alexander, according, to, the, researchers, recent, discoveries, suggest, that, this, site, honours, zeus, and, two, divine, sons, the, sons, are, heracles, and, alexander, hellenization, was, coined, by, the, german, historian, johann, gustav, droysen, to, denote, the, spread, of, greek, language, culture, and, population, into, the, former, persian, empire, after, alexander, s, conquest, this, process, can, be, seen, in, such, great, hellenistic, cities, as, alexandria, antioch, and, seleucia, south, of, modern, baghdad, alexander, sought, to, insert, greek, elements, into, persian, culture, and, to, hybridize, greek, and, persian, culture, homogenizing, the, populations, of, asia, and, europe, although, his, successors, explicitly, rejected, such, policies, hellenization, occurred, throughout, the, region, accompanied, by, a, distinct, and, opposite, orientalization, of, the, successor, states, the, core, of, the, hellenistic, culture, promulgated, by, the, conquests, was, essentially, athenian, the, close, association, of, men, from, across, greece, in, alexander, s, army, directly, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, largely, attic, based, koine, or, common, greek, dialect, koine, spread, throughout, the, hellenistic, world, becoming, the, lingua, franca, of, hellenistic, lands, and, eventually, the, ancestor, of, modern, greek, furthermore, town, planning, education, local, government, and, art, current, in, the, hellenistic, period, were, all, based, on, classical, greek, ideals, evolving, into, distinct, new, forms, commonly, grouped, as, hellenistic, also, the, new, testament, was, written, in, the, koine, greek, language, aspects, of, hellenistic, culture, were, still, evident, in, the, traditions, of, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, mid, 15th, century, some, of, the, most, pronounced, effects, of, hellenization, can, be, seen, in, afghanistan, and, india, in, the, region, of, the, relatively, late, rising, greco, bactrian, kingdom, 250, 125, bc, in, modern, afghanistan, pakistan, and, tajikistan, and, the, indo, greek, kingdom, 180, bc, 10, ad, in, modern, afghanistan, and, india, on, the, silk, road, trade, routes, hellenistic, culture, hybridized, with, iranian, and, buddhist, cultures, the, cosmopolitan, art, and, mythology, of, gandhara, a, region, spanning, the, upper, confluence, of, the, indus, swat, and, kabul, rivers, in, modern, pakistan, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, the, 5th, century, ad, are, most, evident, of, the, direct, contact, between, hellenistic, civilization, and, south, asia, as, are, the, edicts, of, ashoka, which, directly, mention, the, greeks, within, ashoka, s, dominion, as, converting, to, buddhism, and, the, reception, of, buddhist, emissaries, by, ashoka, s, contemporaries, in, the, hellenistic, world, the, resulting, syncretism, known, as, greco, buddhism, influenced, the, development, of, buddhism, and, created, a, culture, of, greco, buddhist, art, these, greco, buddhist, kingdoms, sent, some, of, the, first, buddhist, missionaries, to, china, sri, lanka, and, hellenistic, asia, and, europe, greco, buddhist, monasticism, some, of, the, first, and, most, influential, figurative, portrayals, of, the, buddha, appeared, at, this, time, perhaps, modelled, on, greek, statues, of, apollo, in, the, greco, buddhist, style, several, buddhist, traditions, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, ancient, greek, religion, the, concept, of, boddhisatvas, is, reminiscent, of, greek, divine, heroes, and, some, mahayana, ceremonial, practices, burning, incense, gifts, of, flowers, and, food, placed, on, altars, are, similar, to, those, practised, by, the, ancient, greeks, however, similar, practices, were, also, observed, amongst, the, native, indic, culture, one, greek, king, menander, i, probably, became, buddhist, and, was, immortalized, in, buddhist, literature, as, milinda, the, process, of, hellenization, also, spurred, trade, between, the, east, and, west, for, example, greek, astronomical, instruments, dating, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, were, found, in, the, greco, bactrian, city, of, ai, khanoum, in, modern, day, afghanistan, while, the, greek, concept, of, a, spherical, earth, surrounded, by, the, spheres, of, planets, eventually, supplanted, the, long, standing, indian, cosmological, belief, of, a, disc, consisting, of, four, continents, grouped, around, a, central, mountain, mount, meru, like, the, petals, of, a, flower, the, yavanajataka, lit, greek, astronomical, treatise, and, paulisa, siddhanta, texts, depict, the, influence, of, greek, astronomical, ideas, on, indian, astronomy, following, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, in, the, east, hellenistic, influence, on, indian, art, was, far, reaching, in, architecture, a, few, examples, of, the, ionic, order, can, be, found, as, far, as, pakistan, with, the, jandial, temple, near, taxila, several, examples, of, capitals, displaying, ionic, influences, can, be, seen, as, far, as, patna, especially, with, the, pataliputra, capital, dated, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, corinthian, order, is, also, heavily, represented, in, the, art, of, gandhara, especially, through, indo, corinthian, capitals, alexander, and, his, exploits, were, admired, by, many, romans, especially, generals, who, wanted, to, associate, themselves, with, his, achievements, polybius, began, his, histories, by, reminding, romans, of, alexander, s, achievements, and, thereafter, roman, leaders, saw, him, as, a, role, model, pompey, the, great, adopted, the, epithet, magnus, and, even, alexander, s, anastole, type, haircut, and, searched, the, conquered, lands, of, the, east, for, alexander, s, 260, year, old, cloak, which, he, then, wore, as, a, sign, of, greatness, julius, caesar, dedicated, a, lysippean, equestrian, bronze, statue, but, replaced, alexander, s, head, with, his, own, while, octavian, visited, alexander, s, tomb, in, alexandria, and, temporarily, changed, his, seal, from, a, sphinx, to, alexander, s, profile, the, emperor, trajan, also, admired, alexander, as, did, nero, and, caracalla, the, macriani, a, roman, family, that, in, the, person, of, macrinus, briefly, ascended, to, the, imperial, throne, kept, images, of, alexander, on, their, persons, either, on, jewellery, or, embroidered, into, their, clothes, on, the, other, hand, some, roman, writers, particularly, republican, figures, used, alexander, as, a, cautionary, tale, of, how, autocratic, tendencies, can, be, kept, in, check, by, republican, values, alexander, was, used, by, these, writers, as, an, example, of, ruler, values, such, as, amicitia, friendship, and, clementia, clemency, but, also, iracundia, anger, and, cupiditas, gloriae, over, desire, for, glory, emperor, julian, in, his, satire, called, the, caesars, describes, a, contest, between, the, previous, roman, emperors, with, alexander, the, great, called, in, as, an, extra, contestant, in, the, presence, of, the, assembled, gods, the, itinerarium, alexandri, is, a, 4th, century, latin, description, of, alexander, the, great, s, campaigns, julius, caesar, went, to, serve, his, quaestorship, in, hispania, after, his, wife, s, funeral, in, the, spring, or, early, summer, of, 69, bc, while, there, he, encountered, a, statue, of, alexander, the, great, and, realised, with, dissatisfaction, that, he, was, now, at, an, age, when, alexander, had, the, world, at, his, feet, while, he, had, achieved, comparatively, little, pompey, posed, as, the, new, alexander, since, he, was, his, boyhood, hero, after, caracalla, concluded, his, campaign, against, the, alamanni, it, became, evident, that, he, was, inordinately, preoccupied, with, alexander, the, great, he, began, openly, mimicking, alexander, in, his, personal, style, in, planning, his, invasion, of, the, parthian, empire, caracalla, decided, to, arrange, 16, 000, of, his, men, in, macedonian, style, phalanxes, despite, the, roman, army, having, made, the, phalanx, an, obsolete, tactical, formation, the, historian, christopher, matthew, mentions, that, the, term, phalangarii, has, two, possible, meanings, both, with, military, connotations, the, first, refers, merely, to, the, roman, battle, line, and, does, not, specifically, mean, that, the, men, were, armed, with, pikes, and, the, second, bears, similarity, to, the, marian, mules, of, the, late, roman, republic, who, carried, their, equipment, suspended, from, a, long, pole, which, were, in, use, until, at, least, the, 2nd, century, ad, as, a, consequence, the, phalangarii, of, legio, ii, parthica, may, not, have, been, pikemen, but, rather, standard, battle, line, troops, or, possibly, triarii, caracalla, s, mania, for, alexander, went, so, far, that, caracalla, visited, alexandria, while, preparing, for, his, persian, invasion, and, persecuted, philosophers, of, the, aristotelian, school, based, on, a, legend, that, aristotle, had, poisoned, alexander, this, was, a, sign, of, caracalla, s, increasingly, erratic, behaviour, but, this, mania, for, alexander, strange, as, it, was, was, overshadowed, by, subsequent, events, in, alexandria, in, 39, caligula, performed, a, spectacular, stunt, by, ordering, a, temporary, floating, bridge, to, be, built, using, ships, as, pontoons, stretching, for, over, two, miles, from, the, resort, of, baiae, to, the, neighbouring, port, of, puteoli, it, was, said, that, the, bridge, was, to, rival, the, persian, king, xerxes, pontoon, bridge, crossing, of, the, hellespont, caligula, who, could, not, swim, then, proceeded, to, ride, his, favourite, horse, incitatus, across, wearing, the, breastplate, of, alexander, the, great, this, act, was, in, defiance, of, a, prediction, by, tiberius, s, soothsayer, thrasyllus, of, mendes, that, caligula, had, no, more, chance, of, becoming, emperor, than, of, riding, a, horse, across, the, bay, of, baiae, the, diffusion, of, greek, culture, and, language, cemented, by, alexander, s, conquests, in, west, asia, and, north, africa, served, as, a, precondition, for, the, later, roman, expansion, into, these, territories, and, entire, basis, for, the, byzantine, empire, according, to, errington, alexander, wrote, and, received, numerous, letters, but, no, originals, survive, a, few, official, letters, addressed, to, the, greek, cities, survive, in, copies, inscribed, in, stone, and, the, content, of, others, is, sometimes, reported, in, historical, sources, these, only, occasionally, quote, the, letters, and, it, is, an, open, question, how, reliable, such, quotations, are, several, fictitious, letters, some, perhaps, based, on, actual, letters, made, their, way, into, the, romance, tradition, many, of, the, legends, about, alexander, derive, from, his, own, lifetime, probably, encouraged, by, alexander, himself, his, court, historian, callisthenes, portrayed, the, sea, in, cilicia, as, drawing, back, from, him, in, proskynesis, writing, shortly, after, alexander, s, death, onesicritus, invented, a, tryst, between, alexander, and, thalestris, queen, of, the, mythical, amazons, he, reportedly, read, this, passage, to, his, patron, king, lysimachus, who, had, been, one, of, alexander, s, generals, and, who, quipped, i, wonder, where, i, was, at, the, time, in, the, first, centuries, after, alexander, s, death, probably, in, alexandria, a, quantity, of, the, legendary, material, coalesced, into, a, text, known, as, the, alexander, romance, later, falsely, ascribed, to, callisthenes, and, therefore, known, as, pseudo, callisthenes, this, text, underwent, over, one, hundred, recensions, translations, and, derivations, throughout, the, islamic, and, european, worlds, in, premodern, times, containing, many, dubious, stories, and, was, translated, into, twenty, five, languages, for, example, middle, persian, syriac, and, arabic, alexander, the, great, s, accomplishments, and, legacy, have, been, depicted, in, many, cultures, alexander, has, featured, in, both, high, and, popular, culture, beginning, from, his, own, era, to, the, present, day, the, alexander, romance, in, particular, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, portrayals, of, alexander, in, later, cultures, from, persian, to, medieval, european, to, modern, greek, alexander, features, prominently, in, modern, greek, folklore, more, than, any, other, ancient, figure, the, colloquial, form, of, his, name, in, modern, greek, o, megalexandros, is, a, household, name, and, he, is, the, only, ancient, hero, to, appear, in, the, karagiozis, shadow, play, one, well, known, fable, among, greek, seamen, involves, a, solitary, mermaid, who, would, grasp, a, ship, s, prow, during, a, storm, and, ask, the, captain, is, king, alexander, alive, the, answer, should, be, he, is, alive, and, well, and, rules, the, world, causing, the, mermaid, to, vanish, and, the, sea, to, calm, any, other, answer, would, cause, the, mermaid, to, turn, into, a, raging, gorgon, who, would, drag, the, ship, to, the, bottom, of, the, sea, all, hands, aboard, in, pre, islamic, middle, persian, zoroastrian, literature, alexander, is, referred, to, by, the, epithet, gujastak, meaning, accursed, and, is, accused, of, destroying, temples, and, burning, the, sacred, texts, of, zoroastrianism, in, islamic, persia, under, the, influence, of, the, alexander, romance, in, persian, iskandarnameh, a, more, positive, portrayal, of, alexander, emerges, firdausi, s, shahnameh, the, book, of, kings, includes, alexander, in, a, line, of, legitimate, persian, shahs, a, mythical, figure, who, explored, the, far, reaches, of, the, world, in, search, of, the, fountain, of, youth, in, the, shahnameh, alexander, s, first, journey, is, to, mecca, to, pray, at, the, kaaba, alexander, was, depicted, as, performing, a, hajj, pilgrimage, to, mecca, many, times, in, subsequent, islamic, art, and, literature, later, persian, writers, associate, him, with, philosophy, portraying, him, at, a, symposium, with, figures, such, as, socrates, plato, and, aristotle, in, search, of, immortality, the, figure, of, dhu, al, qarnayn, arabic, lit, the, two, horned, one, is, believed, by, the, majority, of, modern, researchers, of, the, qur, an, as, well, as, islamic, commentators, to, be, a, reference, to, alexander, the, figure, is, also, believed, by, scholars, to, be, based, on, later, legends, of, alexander, in, this, tradition, he, was, a, heroic, figure, who, built, a, wall, to, defend, against, the, nations, of, gog, and, magog, he, also, travelled, the, known, world, in, search, of, the, water, of, life, and, immortality, eventually, becoming, a, prophet, the, syriac, version, of, the, alexander, romance, portrays, him, as, an, ideal, christian, world, conqueror, who, prayed, to, the, one, true, god, in, egypt, alexander, was, portrayed, as, the, son, of, nectanebo, ii, the, last, pharaoh, before, the, persian, conquest, his, defeat, of, darius, was, depicted, as, egypt, s, salvation, proving, egypt, was, still, ruled, by, an, egyptian, according, to, josephus, alexander, was, shown, the, book, of, daniel, when, he, entered, jerusalem, which, described, a, mighty, greek, king, who, would, conquer, the, persian, empire, this, is, cited, as, a, reason, for, sparing, jerusalem, in, hindi, and, urdu, the, name, sikandar, derived, from, the, persian, name, for, alexander, denotes, a, rising, young, talent, and, the, delhi, sultanate, ruler, alauddin, khalji, stylized, himself, as, sikandar, i, sani, the, second, alexander, the, great, in, medieval, india, turkic, and, afghan, sovereigns, from, the, iranian, cultured, region, of, central, asia, brought, positive, cultural, connotations, of, alexander, to, the, indian, subcontinent, resulting, in, the, efflorescence, of, sikandernameh, alexander, romances, written, by, indo, persian, poets, such, as, amir, khusrau, and, the, prominence, of, alexander, the, great, as, a, popular, subject, in, mughal, era, persian, miniatures, in, medieval, europe, alexander, the, great, was, revered, as, a, member, of, the, nine, worthies, a, group, of, heroes, whose, lives, were, believed, to, encapsulate, all, the, ideal, qualities, of, chivalry, during, the, first, italian, campaign, of, the, french, revolutionary, wars, in, a, question, from, bourrienne, asking, whether, he, gave, his, preference, to, alexander, or, caesar, napoleon, said, that, he, places, alexander, the, great, in, the, first, rank, the, main, reason, being, his, campaign, on, asia, in, the, greek, anthology, there, are, poems, referring, to, alexander, throughout, time, art, objects, related, to, alexander, were, being, created, in, addition, to, speech, works, sculptures, and, paintings, in, modern, times, alexander, is, still, the, subject, of, musical, and, cinematic, works, the, song, alexander, the, great, by, the, british, heavy, metal, band, iron, maiden, is, indicative, some, films, that, have, been, shot, with, the, theme, of, alexander, are, there, are, also, many, references, to, other, movies, and, tv, series, newer, novels, about, alexander, are, the, trilogy, alexander, the, great, by, valerio, massimo, manfredi, consisting, of, the, son, of, the, dream, the, sand, of, amon, and, the, ends, of, the, world, the, trilogy, of,

few, inscriptions, and, fragments, texts, written, by, people, who, actually, knew, alexander, or, who, gathered, information, from, men, who, served, with, alexander, were, all, lost, contemporaries, who, wrote, accounts, of, his, life, included, alexander, s, campaign, historian, callisthenes, alexander, s, generals, ptolemy, and, nearchus, aristobulus, a, junior, officer, on, the, campaigns, and, onesicritus, alexander, s, chief, helmsman, their, works, are, lost, but, later, works, based, on, these, original, sources, have, survived, the, earliest, of, these, is, diodorus, siculus, 1st,

whose, work, dated, as, late, as, the, 4th, century, of, these, arrian, is, generally, considered, the, most, reliable, given, that, he, used, ptolemy, and, aristobulus, as, his, sources, closely, followed, by, diodorus
