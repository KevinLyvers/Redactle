guang, had, kum, raj, va, imprisoned, for, many, years, essentially, as, booty, during, this, time, it, is, thought, that, kum, raj, va, became, familiar, with, the, chinese, language, kum, raj, va, was, also, coerced, by, l, into, marrying, the, kucha, king, s, daughter, and, so, he, was, forced, to, give, up, his, monk, s, vows, after, the, yao, family, of, later, qin, overthrew, the, previous,

free, kum, raj, va, from, their, hostage, an, exasperated, yao, xing, had, armies, dispatched, to, liangzhou, in, order, to, defeat, the, warlords, of, the, l, family, and, to, have, kum, raj, va, brought, back, to, them, finally, the, armies, of, emperor, yao, succeeded, in, defeating, the, l, family, and, kum, raj, va, was, brought, east, to, the, capital, of, chang, an, in, 401, ce, at, chang, an, kum, raj, va, was, introduced, to, the, emperor, yao, xing, the, court, and, the, buddhist, leaders, he, became, a, famous, and, well, respected, in, china, being, given, the, title, of, national, preceptor, guoshi, at, chang, an, kum, raj, va, led, a, court, sponsored, translation, team, of, scholars, who, worked, on, translating, numerous, sanskrit, buddhist, texts, into, the, chinese, language, yao, xing, looked, upon, him, as, his, own, teacher, and, many, young, and, old, chinese, buddhists, flocked, to, him, learning, both, from, his, direct, teachings, and, through, his, translation, bureau, activities, at, the, xiaoyao, gardens, where, daily, sessions, were, held, attended, by, over, a, thousand, monks, within, a, dozen, years, kum, raj, va, s, translation, bureau, had, translated, about, thirty, five, sutras, in, 294, scrolls, his, translations, are, still, in, use, today, in, chinese, buddhism, kumarajiva, had, four, main, disciples, who, worked, on, his, team, daosheng, sengzhao, daorong, and, sengrui, according, to, paul, williams, mah, praj, p, ramitopade, a, a, text, translated, by, him, also, has, a, clear, association, with, the, vaibh, ikas, sarv, stiv, dins, kum, raj, va, revolutionized, chinese, buddhism, and, his, team, s, translation, style, is, known, for, its, clarity, and, for, overcoming, the, previous, geyi, concept, matching, system, of, translation, which, matched, buddhist, terminology, with, daoist, and, confucian, terms, kum, raj, va, s, readable, translation, style, was, distinctive, possessing, a, flowing, smoothness, that, reflects, his, prioritization, on, conveying, the, meaning, as, opposed, to, precise, literal, rendering, because, of, this, his, renderings, of, seminal, mah, y, na, texts, have, often, remained, more, popular, than, later, more, literal, translations, e, g, those, of, xuanzang, kum, raj, va, s, translations, were, very, influential, on, the, development, of, buddhist, chinese, and, they, introduced, much, commonly, used, terminology, such, as, these, translations, were, a, group, effort, and, therefore, it, is, more, accurate, to, say, that, they, were, translated, by, a, committee, which, was, guided, by, kum, raj, va, not, by, kum, raj, va, alone, the, process, of, translation, began, with, the, reading, of, the, text, by, kum, raj, va, who, would, also, give, a, running, commentary, in, chinese, the, chinese, monks, and, students, would, discuss, the, text, with, kum, raj, va, and, among, themselves, a, translation, in, chinese, would, emerge, from, this, process, which, would, be, checked, by, kum, raj, va, the, text, was, then, written, down, and, revised, numerous, times, these, were, also, public, events, which, were, attended, by, devotees, including, emperor, yao, xing, kum, raj, va, also, developed, a, system, of, transcription, in, order, to, render, sanskrit, terms, in, chinese, by, using, certain, chinese, characters, and, their, sounds, to, represent, each, syllable, of, a, foreign, word, this, system, would, go, on, to, become, the, basis, of, the, development, of, pinyin, romanization, this, encounter, with, sanskrit, influenced, the, development, of, the, chinese, language, itself, not, only, in, the, adoption, of, specifically, buddhist, terms, but, also, regarding, certain, secular, terms, as, well, such, as, moment, kum, raj, va, has, sometimes, been, regarded, by, both, the, chinese, and, by, western, scholars, as, abbreviating, his, translations, with, later, translators, such, as, xuanzang, being, regarded, as, being, more, precise, according, to, jan, nattier, this, is, actually, an, erroneous, and, mistaken, view, and, the, main, difference, was, due, to, the, earlier, versions, of, kumarajiva, s, source, texts, here, kum, raj, va, s, work, can, be, compared, with, an, extant, indic, manuscript, that, is, in, those, rare, cases, where, part, or, all, of, a, text, he, translated, has, survived, in, a, sanskrit, or, prakrit, version, a, somewhat, surprising, result, emerges, while, his, translations, are, indeed, shorter, in, many, instances, than, their, extant, and, much, later, sanskrit, counterparts, when, earlier, indic, language, manuscript, fragments, are, available, they, often, provide, exact, parallels, of, kum, raj, va, s, supposed, abbreviations, what, seems, likely, to, have, happened, in, sum, is, that, kum, raj, va, was, working, from, earlier, indian, versions, in, which, these, expansions, had, not, yet, taken, place, according, to, john, m, thompson, at, present, there, are, fifty, two, translations, in, the, taish, under, his, name, and, their, authenticity, is, fairly, well, accepted, they, include, mah, y, na, sutras, as, well, as, works, on, buddhist, meditation, dhy, na, and, abhidharma, among, the, most, important, sutras, translated, by, kum, raj, va, and, his, team, probably, from, kuchan, target, sources, are, the, following, they, also, translated, several, key, treatises, mainly, of, the, madhyamaka, school, which, became, the, central, works, of, east, asian, madhyamaka, buddhism, these, are, other, treatises, that, the, team, worked, on, include, the, da, abh, mika, vibh, t, 1521, a, commentary, to, the, da, abh, mik, s, tra, attributed, to, nagarjuna, and, the, treatise, on, arising, bodhicitta, t, 1659, kum, raj, va, and, his, team, also, translated, some, treatises, on, meditation, dhy, na, in, the, taisho, tripitaka, vol, 15, five, meditation, works, are, attributed, to, kum, raj, va, scholars, are, divided, on, how, many, of, these, were, actually, worked, on, by, kum, raj, va, though, t, 613, and, t, 614, are, well, attested, in, early, catalogs, and, prefaces, furthermore, chinese, sources, indicate, that, these, works, were, edited, summarized, and, extracted, from, indian, sources, eric, greene, explains, that, the, main, methods, of, mediation, taught, in, t, 614, are, the, five, gates, of, chan, associated, with, the, so, called, yog, c, ras, of, northwest, india, which, became, a, standard, arrangement, in, later, writings, on, meditation, and, are, the, following, after, having, calmed, the, mind, and, entered, dhy, na, chan, through, these, methods, the, meditator, then, proceeds, to, develop, wisdom, praj, by, cultivating, the, four, foundations, of, mindfulness, si, nian, chu, sm, tyupasth, na, according, to, greene, following, this, one, moves, through, the, so, called, four, nirvedha, bh, g, ya, ku, alam, la, si, shan, gen, the, roots, of, good, that, lead, to, liberation, which, in, the, sarv, stiv, din, system, are, the, highest, levels, of, mundane, accomplishment, this, in, turn, leads, to, the, so, called, path, of, vision, dar, ana, maraga, a, sequence, of, sixteen, mental, moments, in, which, by, means, of, insight, into, the, four, noble, truths, while, t, 614, discusses, the, path, of, hinayana, as, well, as, the, bodhisattva, path, the, actual, meditation, practices, are, not, different, they, are, just, approached, in, different, ways, for, example, the, bodhisattva, practices, the, same, contemplation, of, impurity, as, the, sravaka, but, they, are, also, warned, not, to, become, so, disgusted, with, the, world, that, they, seek, immediate, nirv, a, instead, a, bodhisattva, should, always, practice, these, meditations, with, the, wish, for, perfecting, themselves, in, order, to, help, others, as, such, kum, raj, va, seems, to, have, understood, the, practice, of, a, bodhisattva, to, have, consisted, of, the, same, methods, of, meditation, found, in, r, vaka, y, na, sources, the, only, difference, being, that, bodhisattvas, have, a, different, motivation, and, a, different, goal, buddhahood, other, translations, include, the, da, zhuang, yan, jing, lun, mah, la, k, ra, s, tra, stra, of, asvaghosa, and, samyukta, avadana, sutra, according, to, robinson, kum, raj, va, s, additions, to, the, vinaya, section, of, the, chinese, canon, are, the, sarv, stiv, da, vinaya, t, 1435, the, sarv, stiv, da, pr, timok, a, sutra, t, 1436, and, according, to, tradition, the, pu, sa, chieh, p, n, bodhisattva, pr, timok, a, which, is, probably, the, second, half, of, the, present, brahmajala, sutra, t, 1484, kum, raj, va, is, also, known, to, have, authored, a, few, original, works, including, his, commentary, on, the, vimalak, rti, nirdesa, s, tra, zhu, weimojie, jing, taisho, number, 1775, and, the, shixiang, lun, treatise, on, tattva, now, lost, kum, raj, va, and, his, team, are, also, responsible, for, a, biography, of, nagarjuna, t, 2047, which, may, have, been, based, on, kum, raj, va, s, own, accounts, to, his, students, another, text, which, contains, some, original, teachings, by, kum, raj, va, is, the, jiumoluoshi, fashi, dayi, the, great, teaching, of, dharma, master, kum, raj, va, t, no, 1856, which, is, a, series, of, letters, between, kum, raj, va, and, lushan, huiyuan, 334, 416, discussing, some, basic, mahayana, topics, regarding, kum, raj, va, s, own, philosophical, views, according, to, richard, h, robinson, he, shows, himself, to, be, an, orthodox, nyav, din, and, m, dhyamika, rejects, the, authority, of, the, abhidharma, and, interprets, the, gamas, in, a, mah, y, na, way, holds, that, the, buddha, s, statements, are, purely, pragmatic, and, do, not, imply, any, real, entities, and, denies, that, real, entities, arise, because, a, neither, inherence, nor, non, inherence, of, the, effect, in, the, cause, is, admissible, and, b, simultaneous, and, successive, occurrence, of, cause, and, effect, are, alike, untenable, he, maintains, that, reality, transcends, the, four, modes, of, the, tetralemma, and, he, holds, nagarjuna, s, concept, of, negation, likewise, according, to, john, m, thompson, the, philosophy, which, emerges, from, the, explanations, of, kum, raj, va, is, virtually, identical, to, the, views, of, nagarjuna, and, other, madhyamikas, stressing, the, emptiness, of, all, dharmas, even, the, emptiness, of, emptiness, and, the, bodhisattva, s, non, attachment, to, all, things, and, teachings, thompson, adds, like, both, the, praj, p, ramita, sutras, and, madhyamika, commentaries, kum, raj, va, says, that, the, buddha, s, teachings, ultimately, come, from, and, lead, us, to, a, level, beyond, words, and, thought, because, the, buddha, and, bodhisattvas, reside, in, this, transcendent, realm, which, is, none, other, than, our, present, world, their, wisdom, enables, them, to, use, various, upaya, to, lead, suffering, beings, to, enlightenment, apparent, contradictions, and, confusions, in, buddhist, texts, are, due, to, their, up, ya, which, accommodate, to, the, audience, s, level, and, lead, them, to, the, truth, kum, raj, va, even, suggests, that, the, teachings, in, the, sutras, may, delude, those, who, are, unprepared, i, e, at, a, lower, level, of, understanding, according, to, kum, raj, va, we, truly, understand, the, dharma, only, when, we, attain, complete, and, pure, praj, praj, is, the, means, of, removing, all, obstacles, and, hindrances, all, attachments, even, attachments, to, itself, as, kum, raj, va, says, in, the, buddha, dharma, the, medicine, of, praj, is, just, like, this, by, this, medicine, one, demolishes, the, objects, of, addictions, if, within, praj, beings, then, conceive, addiction, then, one, must, practice, a, method, of, treatment, if, within, praj, there, are, no, addictions, to, praj, then, further, treatment, is, not, applied, these, ideas, are, found, in, the, dazhidulun, t, 1509, skt, mah, praj, p, ramitopade, a, various, modern, scholars, also, hold, that, the, dazhidulun, which, was, traditionally, held, to, be, an, original, work, of, nagarjuna, that, was, translated, by, kum, raj, va, s, team, actually, contains, numerous, additions, by, kum, raj, va, and, his, team, or, is, actually, a, product, of, the, editorship, of, kum, raj, va, s, student, sengrui, as, etienne, lamotte, notes, kum, raj, va, s, team, also, edited, and, abridged, the, latter, half, of, this, text, considerably, according, to, rafal, felbur, the, translations, associated, with, his, name, executed, both, from, prakrits, i, e, vernacular, forms, of, sanskrit, and, from, early, forms, of, buddhist, sanskrit, into, a, form, of, classical, chinese, have, enjoyed, enormous, success, in, the, sinitic, tradition, this, success, is, so, great, that, even, when, in, the, subsequent, centuries, other, scholars, produced, new, and, supposedly, improved, translations, of, the, same, texts, it, has, been, the, kumarajiva, versions, that, have, remained, in, use, in, the, devotional, exegetical, and, literary, life, of, east, asia, up, to, the, present, day, in, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, centuries, as, the, sinitic, buddhist, traditions, have, contributed, to, the, emergence, of, a, distinctly, global, modernist, buddhism, the, kumarajiva, corpus, of, early, fifth, century, translations, has, been, an, implicit, major, presence, aside, from, the, linguistic, and, terminological, influence, of, kum, raj, va, s, translation, work, his, work, also, influenced, the, philosophical, understanding, of, buddhism, in, china, according, to, fan, muyou, before, kum, raj, va, many, chinese, buddhists, had, serious, misunderstandings, of, emptiness, and, not, self, this, is, because, they, had, been, influenced, by, neo, taoist, xuanxue, philosophy, and, thus, they, saw, emptiness, as, either, a, kind, of, non, being, as, a, real, or, absolute, substance, both, of, which, are, mistaken, interpretations, of, the, concepts, of, nyat, and, anatman, kum, raj, va, and, his, students, like, sengzhao, and, sengrui, recognized, these, errors, and, worked, to, correct, them, by, introducing, proper, interpretations, based, on, indian, madhyamaka, philosophy
