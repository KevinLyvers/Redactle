still, lacked, a, reliable, income, this, brought, his, conflicts, with, stanislaus, who, was, frustrated, with, lending, him, money, to, their, peak, in, 1912, prezioso, arranged, for, him, to, lecture, on, hamlet, for, the, minerva, society, between, november, 1912, and, february, 1913, joyce, once, more, lectured, at, the, universit, popolare, on, various, topics, in, english, literature, and, applied, for, a, teaching, diploma, in, english, at, the, university, of, padua, he, performed, very, well, on, the, qualification, tests, but, was, denied, because, italy, did, not, recognise, his, degree, from, an, irish, university, in, 1912, joyce, and, his, family, returned, to, dublin, briefly, in, the, summer, while, there, his, three, year, long, struggle, with, roberts, over, the, publication, of, dubliners, came, to, an, end, as, roberts, refused, to, publish, the, book, due, to, concerns, of, libel, roberts, had, the, printed, sheets, destroyed, though, joyce, was, able, to, obtain, a, copy, of, the, proof, sheets, when, joyce, returned, to, trieste, he, wrote, an, invective, against, roberts, gas, from, a, burner, he, never, went, to, dublin, again, joyce, s, fortunes, changed, for, the, better, in, 1913, when, richards, agreed, to, publish, dubliners, it, was, issued, on, 15, june, 1914, eight, and, a, half, years, since, joyce, had, first, submitted, it, to, him, around, the, same, time, he, found, an, unexpected, advocate, in, ezra, pound, who, was, living, in, london, on, the, advice, of, yeats, pound, wrote, to, joyce, asking, if, he, could, include, a, poem, from, chamber, music, i, hear, an, army, charging, upon, the, land, in, the, journal, des, imagistes, they, struck, up, a, correspondence, that, lasted, until, the, late, 1930s, pound, became, joyce, s, promoter, helping, ensure, that, joyce, s, works, were, both, published, and, publicized, after, pound, persuaded, dora, marsden, to, serially, publish, a, portrait, of, the, artist, as, a, young, man, in, the, london, literary, magazine, the, egoist, joyce, s, pace, of, writing, increased, he, completed, a, portrait, of, the, artist, as, a, young, man, by, 1914, resumed, exiles, completing, it, in, 1915, started, the, novelette, giacomo, joyce, which, he, eventually, abandoned, and, began, drafting, ulysses, in, august, 1914, world, war, i, broke, out, although, joyce, and, stanislaus, were, subjects, of, the, united, kingdom, which, was, now, at, war, with, austria, hungary, they, remained, in, trieste, even, when, stanislaus, who, had, publicly, expressed, his, sympathy, for, the, triestine, irredentists, was, interned, at, the, beginning, of, january, 1915, joyce, chose, to, stay, in, may, 1915, italy, declared, war, on, austria, hungary, and, less, than, a, month, later, joyce, took, his, family, to, z, rich, in, neutral, switzerland, joyce, arrived, in, z, rich, as, a, double, exile, he, was, an, irishman, with, a, british, passport, and, a, triestine, on, parole, from, austria, hungary, to, get, to, switzerland, he, had, to, promise, the, austro, hungarian, officials, that, he, would, not, help, the, allies, during, the, war, and, he, and, his, family, had, to, leave, almost, all, of, their, possessions, in, trieste, during, the, war, he, was, kept, under, surveillance, by, both, the, british, and, austro, hungarian, secret, services, joyce, s, first, concern, was, earning, a, living, one, of, nora, s, relatives, sent, them, a, small, sum, to, cover, the, first, few, months, pound, and, yeats, worked, with, the, british, government, to, provide, a, stipend, from, the, royal, literary, fund, in, 1915, and, a, grant, from, the, british, civil, list, the, following, year, eventually, joyce, received, large, regular, sums, from, the, editor, harriet, shaw, weaver, who, operated, the, egoist, and, the, psychotherapist, edith, rockefeller, mccormick, who, lived, in, z, rich, studying, under, carl, jung, weaver, financially, supported, joyce, throughout, the, entirety, of, his, life, and, even, paid, for, his, funeral, between, 1917, and, the, beginning, of, 1919, joyce, was, financially, secure, and, lived, quite, well, the, family, sometimes, stayed, in, locarno, in, the, italian, speaking, region, of, switzerland, however, health, problems, remained, a, constant, issue, during, their, time, in, z, rich, both, joyce, and, nora, suffered, illnesses, that, were, diagnosed, as, nervous, breakdowns, and, he, had, to, undergo, many, eye, surgeries, during, the, war, z, rich, was, the, centre, of, a, vibrant, expatriate, community, joyce, s, regular, evening, hangout, was, the, cafe, pfauen, where, he, got, to, know, a, number, of, the, artists, living, in, the, city, at, the, time, including, the, sculptor, august, suter, and, the, painter, frank, budgen, he, often, used, the, time, spent, with, them, as, material, for, ulysses, he, made, the, acquaintance, of, the, writer, stefan, zweig, who, organised, the, premiere, of, exiles, in, munich, in, august, 1919, he, became, aware, of, dada, which, was, coming, into, its, own, at, the, cabaret, voltaire, he, may, have, even, met, the, marxist, theoretician, and, revolutionary, vladimir, lenin, at, the, cafe, odeon, a, place, they, both, frequented, joyce, kept, up, his, interest, in, music, he, met, ferruccio, busoni, staged, music, with, otto, luening, and, learned, music, theory, from, philipp, jarnach, much, of, what, joyce, learned, about, musical, notation, and, counterpoint, found, its, way, into, ulysses, particularly, the, sirens, section, joyce, avoided, public, discussion, of, the, war, s, politics, and, maintained, strict, neutrality, he, made, few, comments, about, the, 1916, easter, rising, in, ireland, although, he, was, sympathetic, to, the, irish, independence, movement, he, disagreed, with, its, violence, he, stayed, intently, focused, on, ulysses, and, the, ongoing, struggle, to, get, his, work, published, some, of, the, serial, instalments, of, the, portrait, of, the, artist, as, a, young, man, in, the, egoist, had, been, censored, by, the, printers, but, the, entire, novel, was, published, by, b, w, huebsch, in, 1916, in, 1918, pound, got, a, commitment, from, margaret, caroline, anderson, the, owner, and, editor, of, the, new, york, based, literary, magazine, the, little, review, to, publish, ulysses, serially, joyce, co, founded, an, acting, company, the, english, players, and, became, its, business, manager, the, company, was, pitched, to, the, british, government, as, a, contribution, to, the, war, effort, and, mainly, staged, works, by, irish, playwrights, such, as, oscar, wilde, george, bernard, shaw, and, john, millington, synge, for, synge, s, riders, to, the, sea, nora, played, a, principal, role, and, joyce, sang, offstage, which, he, did, again, when, robert, browning, s, in, a, balcony, was, staged, he, hoped, the, company, would, eventually, stage, his, play, exiles, but, his, participation, in, the, english, players, declined, in, the, wake, of, the, great, influenza, epidemic, of, 1918, though, the, company, continued, until, 1920, joyce, s, work, with, the, english, players, involved, him, in, a, lawsuit, henry, wilfred, carr, a, wounded, war, veteran, and, british, consul, accused, joyce, of, underpaying, him, for, his, role, in, the, importance, of, being, earnest, carr, sued, for, compensation, joyce, countersued, for, libel, the, cases, were, resolved, in, 1919, with, joyce, winning, the, compensation, case, but, losing, the, one, for, libel, the, incident, ended, up, creating, acrimony, between, the, british, consulate, and, joyce, for, the, rest, of, his, time, in, z, rich, by, 1919, joyce, was, in, financial, straits, again, mccormick, stopped, paying, her, stipend, partly, because, he, refused, to, submit, to, psychoanalysis, from, jung, and, z, rich, had, become, expensive, to, live, in, after, the, war, furthermore, he, was, becoming, isolated, as, the, city, s, emigres, returned, home, in, october, 1919, joyce, s, family, moved, back, to, trieste, but, it, had, changed, the, austro, hungarian, empire, had, ceased, to, exist, and, trieste, was, now, an, italian, city, in, post, war, recovery, eight, months, after, his, return, joyce, went, to, sirmione, italy, to, meet, pound, who, made, arrangements, for, him, to, move, to, paris, joyce, and, his, family, packed, their, belongings, and, headed, for, paris, in, june, 1920, when, joyce, and, his, family, arrived, in, paris, in, july, 1920, their, visit, was, intended, to, be, a, layover, on, their, way, to, london, for, the, first, four, months, he, stayed, with, ludmila, savitzky, and, met, sylvia, beach, who, ran, the, rive, gauche, bookshop, shakespeare, and, company, beach, quickly, became, an, important, person, in, joyce, s, life, providing, financial, support, and, becoming, one, of, joyce, s, publishers, through, beach, and, pound, joyce, quickly, joined, the, intellectual, circle, of, paris, and, was, integrated, into, the, international, modernist, artist, community, joyce, met, valery, larbaud, who, championed, joyce, s, works, to, the, french, and, supervised, the, french, translation, of, ulysses, paris, became, the, joyces, regular, residence, for, twenty, years, though, they, never, settled, into, a, single, location, for, long, joyce, finished, writing, ulysses, near, the, end, of, 1921, but, had, difficulties, getting, it, published, with, financial, backing, from, the, lawyer, john, quinn, margaret, anderson, and, her, co, editor, jane, heap, had, begun, serially, publishing, it, in, the, little, review, in, march, 1918, but, in, january, and, may, 1919, two, instalments, were, suppressed, as, obscene, and, potentially, subversive, in, september, 1920, an, unsolicited, instalment, of, the, nausicaa, episode, was, sent, to, the, daughter, of, a, new, york, attorney, associated, with, the, new, york, society, for, the, suppression, of, vice, leading, to, an, official, complaint, the, trial, proceedings, continued, until, february, 1921, when, both, anderson, and, healy, defended, by, quinn, were, fined, 50, each, for, publishing, obscenity, and, ordered, to, cease, publishing, ulysses, huebsch, who, had, expressed, interest, in, publishing, the, novel, in, the, united, states, decided, against, it, after, the, trial, weaver, was, unable, to, find, an, english, printer, and, the, novel, was, banned, for, obscenity, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1922, where, it, was, blacklisted, until, 1936, almost, immediately, after, anderson, and, healy, were, ordered, to, stop, printing, ulysses, beach, agreed, to, publish, it, through, her, bookshop, she, had, books, mailed, to, people, in, paris, and, the, united, states, who, had, subscribed, to, get, a, copy, weaver, mailed, books, from, beach, s, plates, to, subscribers, in, england, soon, the, postal, officials, of, both, countries, began, confiscating, the, books, they, were, then, smuggled, into, both, countries, because, the, work, had, no, copyright, in, the, united, states, at, this, time, bootleg, versions, appeared, including, pirate, versions, from, publisher, samuel, roth, who, only, ceased, his, actions, in, 1928, when, a, court, enjoined, publication, ulysses, was, not, legally, published, in, the, united, states, until, 1934, after, judge, john, m, woolsey, ruled, in, united, states, v, one, book, called, ulysses, that, the, book, was, not, obscene, in, 1923, joyce, began, his, next, work, an, experimental, novel, that, eventually, became, finnegans, wake, it, would, take, sixteen, years, to, complete, at, first, joyce, called, it, work, in, progress, which, was, the, name, ford, madox, ford, used, in, april, 1924, when, he, published, its, mamalujo, episode, in, his, magazine, the, transatlantic, review, in, 1926, eugene, and, maria, jolas, serialised, the, novel, in, their, magazine, transition, when, parts, of, the, novel, first, came, out, some, of, joyce, s, supporters, like, stanislaus, pound, and, weaver, wrote, negatively, about, it, and, it, was, criticised, by, writers, like, se, n, faol, in, wyndham, lewis, and, rebecca, west, in, response, joyce, and, the, jolases, organised, the, publication, of, a, collection, of, positive, essays, titled, our, exagmination, round, his, factification, for, incamination, of, work, in, progress, which, included, writings, by, samuel, beckett, and, william, carlos, williams, an, additional, purpose, of, publishing, these, essays, was, to, market, work, in, progress, to, a, larger, audience, joyce, publicly, revealed, the, novel, s, title, as, finnegans, wake, in, 1939, the, same, year, he, completed, it, it, was, published, in, london, by, faber, and, faber, with, the, assistance, of, t, s, eliot, joyce, s, health, problems, afflicted, him, throughout, his, paris, years, he, had, over, a, dozen, eye, operations, but, his, vision, severely, declined, by, 1930, he, was, practically, blind, in, the, left, eye, and, his, right, eye, functioned, poorly, he, even, had, all, of, his, teeth, removed, because, of, infection, at, one, point, joyce, became, worried, that, he, could, not, finish, finnegans, wake, asking, the, irish, author, james, stephens, to, complete, it, if, something, should, happen, joyce, s, financial, problems, continued, although, he, was, now, earning, a, good, income, from, his, investments, and, royalties, his, spending, habits, often, left, him, without, available, money, despite, these, issues, he, published, pomes, penyeach, in, 1927, a, collection, of, thirteen, poems, that, he, wrote, in, trieste, z, rich, and, paris, in, 1930, joyce, began, thinking, of, establishing, a, residence, in, london, once, more, primarily, to, assure, that, giorgio, who, had, just, married, helen, fleischmann, would, have, his, inheritance, secured, under, british, law, joyce, moved, to, london, obtained, a, long, term, lease, on, a, flat, registered, on, the, electoral, roll, and, became, liable, for, jury, service, after, living, together, for, twenty, seven, years, joyce, and, nora, got, married, at, the, register, office, in, kensington, on, 4, july, 1931, joyce, stayed, in, london, for, at, least, six, months, to, establish, his, residency, but, abandoned, his, flat, and, returned, to, paris, later, in, the, year, when, lucia, showed, signs, of, mental, illness, he, planned, to, return, but, never, did, and, later, became, disaffected, with, england, in, later, years, joyce, lived, in, paris, but, frequently, travelled, to, switzerland, for, eye, surgery, or, for, treatment, for, lucia, who, was, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, lucia, was, analysed, by, carl, jung, who, had, previously, written, that, ulysses, was, similar, to, schizophrenic, writing, jung, suggested, that, she, and, her, father, were, two, people, going, into, a, river, except, that, joyce, was, diving, and, lucia, was, falling, in, spite, of, joyce, s, attempts, to, help, lucia, she, remained, permanently, institutionalised, after, his, death, in, the, late, 1930s, joyce, became, increasingly, concerned, about, the, rise, of, fascism, and, antisemitism, as, early, as, 1938, joyce, was, involved, in, helping, a, number, of, jews, escape, nazi, persecution, after, the, fall, of, france, in, 1940, joyce, and, his, family, fled, from, nazi, occupation, returning, to, z, rich, a, final, time, on, 11, january, 1941, joyce, underwent, surgery, in, z, rich, for, a, perforated, duodenal, ulcer, he, fell, into, a, coma, the, following, day, he, awoke, at, 2, am, on, 13, january, 1941, and, asked, a, nurse, to, call, his, wife, and, son, they, were, en, route, when, he, died, 15, minutes, later, at, age, 58, his, body, was, buried, in, the, fluntern, cemetery, in, z, rich, swiss, tenor, max, meili, sang, addio, terra, addio, cielo, from, monteverdi, s, l, orfeo, at, the, burial, service, joyce, had, been, a, subject, of, the, united, kingdom, all, of, his, life, and, although, two, senior, irish, diplomats, were, in, switzerland, at, the, time, only, the, british, consul, attended, the, funeral, when, joseph, walshe, secretary, at, the, department, of, external, affairs, in, dublin, was, informed, of, joyce, s, death, by, frank, cremins, charg, d, affaires, at, bern, walshe, responded, please, wire, details, of, joyce, s, death, if, possible, find, out, did, he, die, a, catholic, express, sympathy, with, mrs, joyce, and, explain, inability, to, attend, funeral, buried, originally, in, an, ordinary, grave, joyce, was, moved, in, 1966, to, a, more, prominent, honour, grave, with, a, seated, portrait, statue, by, american, artist, milton, hebald, nearby, nora, whom, he, had, married, in, 1931, survived, him, by, 10, years, she, is, buried, by, his, side, as, is, their, son, giorgio, who, died, in, 1976, after, joyce, s, death, the, irish, government, declined, nora, s, request, to, permit, the, repatriation, of, joyce, s, remains, despite, being, persistently, lobbied, by, the, american, diplomat, john, j, slocum, in, october, 2019, a, motion, was, put, to, dublin, city, council, to, plan, and, budget, for, the, costs, of, the, exhumations, and, reburials, of, joyce, and, his, family, somewhere, in, dublin, subject, to, his, family, s, wishes, the, proposal, immediately, became, controversial, with, the, irish, times, commenting, it, is, hard, not, to, suspect, that, there, is, a, calculating, even, mercantile, aspect, to, contemporary, ireland, s, relationship, to, its, great, writers, whom, we, are, often, more, keen, to, celebrate, and, if, possible, monetise, than, read, throughout, his, life, joyce, stayed, actively, interested, in, irish, national, politics, and, in, its, relationship, to, british, colonialism, he, studied, socialism, and, anarchism, he, attended, socialist, meetings, and, expressed, an, individualist, view, influenced, by, benjamin, tucker, s, philosophy, and, oscar, wilde, s, essay, the, soul, of, man, under, socialism, he, described, his, opinions, as, those, of, a, socialist, artist, joyce, s, direct, engagement, in, politics, was, strongest, during, his, time, in, trieste, when, he, submitted, newspaper, articles, gave, lectures, and, wrote, letters, advocating, for, ireland, s, independence, from, british, rule, after, leaving, trieste, joyce, s, direct, involvement, in, politics, waned, but, his, later, works, still, reflect, his, commitment, he, remained, sympathetic, to, individualism, and, critical, of, coercive, ideologies, such, as, nationalism, his, novels, address, socialist, anarchist, and, irish, nationalist, issues, ulysses, has, been, read, as, a, novel, critiquing, the, effect, of, british, colonialism, on, the, irish, people, finnegans, wake, has, been, read, as, a, work, that, investigates, the, divisive, issues, of, irish, politics, the, interrelationship, between, colonialism, and, race, and, the, coercive, oppression, of, nationalism, and, fascism, joyce, s, politics, is, reflected, in, his, attitude, toward, his, british, passport, he, wrote, about, the, negative, effects, of, british, occupation, in, ireland, and, was, sympathetic, to, the, attempts, of, the, irish, to, free, themselves, from, it, in, 1907, he, expressed, his, support, for, the, early, sinn, f, in, movement, before, the, establishment, of, the, irish, free, state, in, 1922, however, throughout, his, life, joyce, refused, to, exchange, his, british, passport, for, an, irish, one, when, he, had, a, choice, he, opted, to, renew, his, british, passport, in, 1935, instead, of, obtaining, one, from, the, irish, free, state, and, he, chose, to, keep, it, in, 1940, when, accepting, an, irish, passport, could, have, helped, him, to, leave, vichy, france, more, easily, his, refusal, to, change, his, passport, was, partly, due, to, the, advantages, that, a, british, passport, gave, him, internationally, his, being, out, of, sympathy, with, the, violence, of, irish, politics, and, his, dismay, over, the, irish, free, state, s, political, alignment, with, the, catholic, church, joyce, had, a, complex, relationship, with, religion, firsthand, statements, by, him, and, stanislaus, attest, that, he, did, not, consider, himself, a, catholic, though, his, work, is, deeply, influenced, by, catholicism, in, particular, his, intellectual, foundations, were, grounded, in, his, early, jesuitical, education, even, after, he, left, ireland, he, sometimes, went, to, church, when, living, in, trieste, he, woke, up, early, to, attend, catholic, mass, on, holy, thursday, and, good, friday, or, occasionally, attended, eastern, orthodox, services, stating, that, he, liked, the, ceremonies, better, some, critics, have, argued, that, joyce, firmly, rejected, the, catholic, faith, he, lapsed, from, the, church, early, in, life, and, nora, refused, to, allow, a, catholic, service, when, he, died, his, works, frequently, critique, ridicule, and, blaspheme, catholicism, and, he, appropriates, catholic, rituals, and, concepts, for, his, own, artistic, purposes, nevertheless, catholic, critics, have, argued, that, joyce, never, fully, abandoned, his, faith, wrestling, with, it, in, his, writings, and, becoming, increasingly, reconciled, with, it, they, argue, that, ulysses, and, finnegans, wake, are, expressions, of, a, catholic, sensibility, insisting, that, the, critical, views, of, religion, expressed, by, the, characters, in, his, novel, do, not, represent, the, views, of, joyce, the, author, other, critics, have, suggested, that, joyce, s, apparent, apostasy, was, less, a, denial, of, faith, than, a, transmutation, a, criticism, of, the, church, s, adverse, impact, on, spiritual, life, politics, and, personal, development, joyce, s, attitude, toward, catholicism, has, been, described, as, an, enigma, in, which, there, are, two, joyces, a, modern, one, who, resisted, the, power, of, catholicism, and, another, who, maintained, his, allegiance, to, its, traditions, he, has, been, compared, to, the, medieval, episcopi, vagantes, wandering, bishops, who, left, their, discipline, but, not, their, cultural, heritage, of, thought, joyce, s, responses, to, questions, about, his, faith, were, often, ambiguous, for, example, during, an, interview, after, the, completion, of, ulysses, joyce, was, asked, when, did, you, leave, the, catholic, church, he, answered, that, s, for, the, church, to, say, dubliners, is, a, collection, of, 15, short, stories, first, published, in, 1914, that, form, a, naturalistic, depiction, of, irish, middle, class, life, in, and, around, the, city, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, tales, were, written, when, irish, nationalism, and, the, search, for, national, identity, was, at, its, peak, joyce, holds, up, a, mirror, to, that, identity, as, a, first, step, in, the, spiritual, liberation, of, ireland, the, stories, centre, on, joyce, s, idea, of, an, epiphany, a, moment, when, a, character, experiences, a, life, changing, self, understanding, or, illumination, many, of, the, characters, in, dubliners, later, appear, in, minor, roles, in, joyce, s, novel, ulysses, the, initial, stories, are, narrated, by, child, protagonists, later, stories, deal, with, the, lives, and, concerns, of, progressively, older, people, this, aligns, with, joyce, s, tripartite, division, of, the, collection, into, childhood, adolescence, and, maturity, a, portrait, of, the, artist, as, a, young, man, published, in, 1916, is, a, shortened, rewrite, of, the, novel, stephen, hero, which, was, abandoned, in, 1905, it, is, a, k, nstlerroman, a, kind, of, coming, of, age, novel, depicting, the, childhood, and, adolescence, of, the, protagonist, stephen, dedalus, and, his, gradual, growth, into, artistic, self, consciousness, it, functions, both, as, an, autobiographical, fiction, of, the, author, and, a, biography, of, the, fictional, protagonist, some, hints, of, the, techniques, joyce, frequently, employed, in, later, works, such, as, stream, of, consciousness, interior, monologue, and, references, to, a, character, s, psychic, reality, rather, than, to, his, external, surroundings, are, evident, throughout, this, novel, despite, early, interest, in, the, theatre, joyce, published, only, one, play, exiles, begun, shortly, after, the,
