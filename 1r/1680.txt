dorothy, mary, crowfoot, hodgkin, om, frs, honfrsc, n, e, crowfoot, 12, may, 1910, 29, july, 1994, was, a, nobel, prize, winning, english, chemist, who, advanced, the, technique, of, x, ray, crystallography, to, determine, the, structure, of, biomolecules, which, became, essential, for, structural, biology, among, her, most, influential, discoveries, are, the, confirmation, of, the, structure, of, penicillin, as, previously, surmised, by, edward, abraham, and, ernst, boris, chain, and, mapping, the, structure, of, vitamin, b, 12, for, which, in, 1964, she, became, the, third, woman, to, win, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, hodgkin, also, elucidated, the, structure, of, insulin, in, 1969, after, 35, years, of, work, hodgkin, used, the, name, dorothy, crowfoot, until, twelve, years, after, marrying, thomas, lionel, hodgkin, when, she, began, using, dorothy, crowfoot, hodgkin, hodgkin, is, referred, to, as, dorothy, hodgkin, by, the, royal, society, when, referring, to, its, sponsorship, of, the, dorothy, hodgkin, fellowship, and, by, somerville, college, the, national, archives, of, the, united, kingdom, refer, to, her, as, dorothy, mary, crowfoot, hodgkin, dorothy, mary, crowfoot, was, born, in, cairo, egypt, the, oldest, of, the, four, daughters, whose, parents, worked, in, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, in, the, colonial, administration, and, later, as, archaeologists, dorothy, came, from, a, distinguished, family, of, archaeologists, her, parents, were, john, winter, crowfoot, 1873, 1959, working, for, the, country, s, ministry, of, education, and, his, wife, grace, mary, n, e, hood, 1877, 1957, known, to, friends, and, family, as, molly, the, family, lived, in, cairo, during, the, winter, months, returning, to, england, each, year, to, avoid, the, hotter, part, of, the, season, in, egypt, in, 1914, hodgkin, s, mother, left, her, age, 4, and, her, two, younger, sisters, joan, age, 2, and, elisabeth, age, 7, months, with, their, crowfoot, grandparents, near, worthing, and, returned, to, her, husband, in, egypt, they, spent, much, of, their, childhood, apart, from, their, parents, yet, they, were, supportive, from, afar, her, mother, would, encourage, dorothy, to, pursue, the, interest, in, crystals, first, displayed, at, the, age, of, 10, in, 1923, dorothy, and, her, sister, would, study, pebbles, that, they, had, found, in, nearby, streams, using, portable, mineral, analysis, kit, their, parents, then, moved, south, to, sudan, where, until, 1926, her, father, was, in, charge, of, education, and, archaeology, her, mother, s, four, brothers, were, killed, in, world, war, i, and, as, a, result, she, became, an, ardent, supporter, of, the, new, league, of, nations, in, 1921, hodgkin, s, father, entered, her, in, the, sir, john, leman, grammar, school, in, beccles, england, where, she, was, one, of, two, girls, allowed, to, study, chemistry, only, once, when, she, was, 13, did, she, make, an, extended, visit, to, her, parents, then, living, in, khartoum, the, capital, of, sudan, where, her, father, was, principal, of, gordon, college, when, she, was, 14, her, distant, cousin, the, chemist, charles, harington, later, sir, charles, recommended, d, s, parsons, fundamentals, of, biochemistry, resuming, the, pre, war, pattern, her, parents, lived, and, worked, abroad, for, part, of, the, year, returning, to, england, and, their, children, for, several, months, every, summer, in, 1926, on, his, retirement, from, the, sudan, civil, service, her, father, took, the, post, of, director, of, the, british, school, of, archaeology, in, jerusalem, where, he, and, her, mother, remained, until, 1935, in, 1928, hodgkin, joined, her, parents, at, the, archaeological, site, of, jerash, in, present, day, jordan, where, she, documented, the, patterns, of, mosaics, from, multiple, byzantine, era, churches, dated, to, the, 5th, 6th, centuries, she, spent, more, than, a, year, finishing, the, drawings, as, she, started, her, studies, in, oxford, while, also, conducting, chemical, analyses, of, glass, tesserae, from, the, same, site, her, attention, to, detail, through, the, creation, of, precise, scale, drawings, of, these, mosaics, mirrors, her, subsequent, work, in, recognising, and, documenting, patterns, in, chemistry, hodgkin, enjoyed, the, experience, of, field, archaeology, so, much, that, she, considered, giving, up, chemistry, in, favour, of, archaeology, her, drawings, are, archived, by, yale, university, hodgkin, developed, a, passion, for, chemistry, from, a, young, age, and, her, mother, a, proficient, botanist, fostered, her, interest, in, the, sciences, on, her, 16th, birthday, her, mother, gave, her, a, book, by, w, h, bragg, on, x, ray, crystallography, concerning, the, nature, of, things, which, helped, her, decide, her, future, she, was, further, encouraged, by, the, chemist, a, f, joseph, a, family, friend, who, also, worked, in, sudan, her, state, school, education, did, not, include, latin, then, required, for, entrance, to, oxbridge, her, leman, school, headmaster, george, watson, gave, her, personal, tuition, in, the, subject, enabling, her, to, pass, the, university, of, oxford, entrance, examination, when, hodgkin, was, asked, in, later, life, to, name, her, childhood, heroes, she, named, three, women, first, and, foremost, her, mother, molly, the, medical, missionary, mary, slessor, and, margery, fry, the, principal, of, somerville, college, in, 1928, at, age, 18, hodgkin, entered, somerville, college, oxford, where, she, studied, chemistry, she, graduated, in, 1932, with, a, first, class, honours, degree, the, third, woman, at, this, institution, to, achieve, this, distinction, in, the, autumn, of, that, year, she, began, studying, for, a, phd, at, newnham, college, cambridge, under, the, supervision, of, john, desmond, bernal, it, was, then, that, she, became, aware, of, the, potential, of, x, ray, crystallography, to, determine, the, structure, of, proteins, she, was, working, with, bernal, on, the, technique, s, first, application, to, the, analysis, of, a, biological, substance, pepsin, the, pepsin, experiment, is, largely, credited, to, hodgkin, however, she, always, made, it, clear, that, it, was, bernal, who, initially, took, the, photographs, and, gave, her, additional, key, insights, her, phd, was, awarded, in, 1937, for, research, on, x, ray, crystallography, and, the, chemistry, of, sterols, in, 1933, hodgkin, was, awarded, a, research, fellowship, by, somerville, college, and, in, 1934, she, moved, back, to, oxford, she, started, teaching, chemistry, with, her, own, lab, equipment, the, college, appointed, her, its, first, fellow, and, tutor, in, chemistry, in, 1936, a, post, which, she, held, until, 1977, in, the, 1940s, one, of, her, students, was, margaret, roberts, later, margaret, thatcher, who, while, prime, minister, hung, a, portrait, of, hodgkin, in, her, office, at, downing, street, out, of, respect, for, her, former, teacher, hodgkin, was, however, a, life, long, labour, party, supporter, in, april, 1953, together, with, sydney, brenner, jack, dunitz, leslie, orgel, and, beryl, m, oughton, hodgkin, was, one, of, the, first, people, to, travel, from, oxford, to, cambridge, to, see, the, model, of, the, double, helix, structure, of, dna, constructed, by, francis, crick, and, james, watson, which, was, based, on, data, and, technique, acquired, by, maurice, wilkins, and, rosalind, franklin, according, to, the, late, dr, beryl, oughton, married, name, rimmer, they, drove, to, cambridge, in, two, cars, after, hodgkin, announced, that, they, were, off, to, see, the, model, of, the, structure, of, dna, hodgkin, became, a, reader, at, oxford, in, 1957, and, she, was, given, a, fully, modern, laboratory, the, following, year, in, 1960, hodgkin, was, appointed, the, royal, society, s, wolfson, research, professor, a, position, she, held, until, 1970, this, provided, her, salary, research, expenses, and, research, assistance, to, continue, her, work, at, the, university, of, oxford, she, was, a, fellow, of, wolfson, college, oxford, from, 1977, to, 1983, hodgkin, was, particularly, noted, for, discovering, three, dimensional, biomolecular, structures, in, 1945, working, with, c, h, harry, carlisle, she, published, the, first, such, structure, of, a, steroid, cholesteryl, iodide, having, worked, with, cholesteryls, since, the, days, of, her, doctoral, studies, in, 1945, hodgkin, and, her, colleagues, including, biochemist, barbara, low, solved, the, structure, of, penicillin, demonstrating, contrary, to, scientific, opinion, at, the, time, that, it, contains, a, lactam, ring, the, work, was, not, published, until, 1949, in, 1948, hodgkin, first, encountered, vitamin, b, 12, one, of, the, most, structurally, complex, vitamins, known, and, created, new, crystals, vitamin, b, 12, had, first, been, discovered, at, merck, earlier, that, year, it, had, a, structure, at, the, time, that, was, almost, completely, unknown, and, when, hodgkin, discovered, it, contained, cobalt, she, realized, the, structure, actualization, could, be, determined, by, x, ray, crystallography, analysis, the, large, size, of, the, molecule, and, the, fact, that, the, atoms, were, largely, unaccounted, for, aside, from, cobalt, posed, a, challenge, in, structure, analysis, that, had, not, been, previously, explored, from, these, crystals, she, deduced, the, presence, of, a, ring, structure, because, the, crystals, were, pleochroic, a, finding, which, she, later, confirmed, using, x, ray, crystallography, the, b, 12, study, published, by, hodgkin, was, described, by, lawrence, bragg, as, being, as, significant, as, breaking, the, sound, barrier, scientists, from, merck, had, previously, crystallised, b, 12, but, had, published, only, refractive, indices, of, the, substance, the, final, structure, of, b, 12, for, which, hodgkin, was, later, awarded, the, nobel, prize, was, published, in, 1955, and, 1956, insulin, was, one, of, hodgkin, s, most, extraordinary, research, projects, it, began, in, 1934, when, she, was, offered, a, small, sample, of, crystalline, insulin, by, robert, robinson, the, hormone, captured, her, imagination, because, of, the, intricate, and, wide, ranging, effect, it, has, in, the, body, however, at, this, stage, x, ray, crystallography, had, not, been, developed, far, enough, to, cope, with, the, complexity, of, the, insulin, molecule, she, and, others, spent, many, years, improving, the, technique, it, took, 35, years, after, taking, her, first, photograph, of, an, insulin, crystal, for, x, ray, crystallography, and, computing, techniques, to, be, able, to, tackle, larger, and, more, complex, molecules, like, insulin, hodgkin, s, dream, of, unlocking, the, structure, of, insulin, was, put, on, hold, until, 1969, when, she, was, finally, able, to, work, with, her, team, of, young, international, scientists, to, uncover, the, structure, for, the, first, time, hodgkin, s, work, with, insulin, was, instrumental, in, paving, the, way, for, insulin, to, be, mass, produced, and, used, on, a, large, scale, for, treatment, of, both, type, one, and, type, two, diabetes, she, went, on, to, cooperate, with, other, laboratories, active, in, insulin, research, giving, advice, and, traveling, the, world, giving, talks, about, insulin, and, its, importance, for, the, future, of, diabetes, solving, the, structure, of, insulin, had, two, important, implications, for, the, treatment, of, diabetes, both, making, mass, production, of, insulin, possible, and, allowing, scientists, to, alter, the, structure, of, insulin, to, create, even, better, drug, options, for, patients, going, forward, hodgkin, s, soft, spoken, gentle, and, modest, demeanor, hid, a, steely, determination, to, achieve, her, ends, whatever, obstacles, might, stand, in, her, way, she, inspired, devotion, in, her, students, and, colleagues, even, the, most, junior, of, whom, knew, her, simply, as, dorothy, her, structural, studies, of, biologically, important, molecules, set, standards, for, a, field, that, was, very, much, in, development, during, her, work, life, she, made, fundamental, contributions, to, the, understanding, of, how, these, molecules, carry, out, their, tasks, in, living, system, hodgkin, s, mentor, professor, john, desmond, bernal, greatly, influenced, her, life, scientifically, politically, and, personally, bernal, was, a, key, scientific, adviser, to, the, uk, government, during, the, second, world, war, he, was, also, an, open, and, vocal, member, of, the, communist, party, and, a, faithful, supporter, of, the, soviet, regime, until, its, invasion, of, hungary, in, 1956, he, was, a, chemist, who, believed, in, equal, opportunity, for, women, in, his, laboratory, hodgkin, extended, work, that, he, began, on, biological, molecules, including, sterols, she, helped, him, to, make, the, first, x, ray, diffraction, studies, of, pepsin, and, crystalline, protein, hodgkin, always, referred, to, him, as, sage, they, were, lovers, before, she, met, thomas, hodgkin, the, marriages, of, both, dorothy, and, bernal, were, unconventional, by, the, standards, of, the, present, and, of, those, days, in, 1934, at, the, age, of, 24, dorothy, began, experiencing, pain, in, her, hands, causing, them, to, become, swollen, and, distorted, she, was, diagnosed, with, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, went, to, a, clinic, in, buxton, for, thermal, baths, and, gold, treatments, after, some, treatment, hodgkin, returned, to, the, lab, where, she, struggled, to, use, the, main, switch, on, the, x, ray, equipment, due, to, the, condition, of, her, hands, she, had, to, create, a, lever, on, her, own, in, order, to, utilize, the, switch, her, condition, would, become, progressively, worse, and, debilitating, over, time, with, deformities, in, both, her, hands, and, feet, and, prolonged, periods, of, pain, while, hodgkin, spent, a, great, deal, of, time, in, a, wheelchair, in, her, later, years, she, remained, scientifically, active, in, her, career, in, 1937, dorothy, crowfoot, married, thomas, lionel, hodgkin, an, historian, s, son, who, was, then, teaching, an, adult, education, class, in, mining, and, industrial, communities, in, the, north, of, england, after, he, resigned, from, the, colonial, office, he, was, an, intermittent, member, of, the, communist, party, and, later, wrote, several, major, works, on, african, politics, and, history, becoming, a, well, known, lecturer, at, balliol, college, in, oxford, as, his, health, was, too, poor, for, active, military, service, he, continued, working, throughout, world, war, ii, returning, to, oxford, on, the, weekends, where, his, wife, remained, working, on, penicillin, the, couple, had, three, children, luke, b, 1938, d, oct, 2020, elizabeth, b, 1941, and, toby, b, 1946, the, oldest, son, luke, became, a, mathematics, instructor, at, the, new, university, of, warwick, their, daughter, elizabeth, followed, her, father, s, career, as, a, historian, their, younger, son, toby, studied, botany, and, agriculture, overall, thomas, hodgkin, spent, extended, periods, of, time, in, west, africa, where, he, was, enthusiastic, supporter, and, chronicler, of, the, emerging, postcolonial, states, hodgkin, published, as, dorothy, crowfoot, until, 1949, when, she, was, persuaded, by, hans, clarke, s, secretary, to, use, her, married, name, on, a, chapter, she, contributed, to, the, chemistry, of, penicillin, by, then, she, had, been, married, for, 12, years, given, birth, to, three, children, and, been, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, frs, thereafter, she, would, publish, as, dorothy, crowfoot, hodgkin, and, this, was, the, name, used, by, the, nobel, foundation, in, its, award, to, her, and, the, biography, it, included, among, other, nobel, prize, recipients, it, is, also, what, the, science, history, institute, calls, her, for, simplicity, s, sake, hodgkin, is, referred, to, as, dorothy, hodgkin, by, the, royal, society, when, referring, to, its, sponsorship, of, the, dorothy, hodgkin, fellowship, and, by, somerville, college, after, it, inaugurated, the, annual, lectures, in, her, honour, the, national, archives, of, the, united, kingdom, refer, to, her, as, dorothy, mary, crowfoot, hodgkin, on, a, variety, of, plaques, commemorating, places, where, she, worked, or, lived, e, g, 94, woodstock, road, oxford, she, is, dorothy, crowfoot, hodgkin, in, 2022, the, department, of, biochemistry, in, oxford, renamed, its, much, expanded, building, after, hodgkin, calling, it, the, dorothy, crowfoot, hodgkin, building, between, the, 1950s, and, the, 1970s, hodgkin, established, and, maintained, lasting, contacts, with, scientists, in, her, field, abroad, at, the, institute, of, crystallography, in, moscow, in, india, and, with, the, chinese, group, working, in, beijing, and, shanghai, on, the, structure, of, insulin, her, first, visit, to, china, was, in, 1959, over, the, next, quarter, century, she, travelled, there, seven, more, times, the, last, visit, a, year, before, her, death, particularly, memorable, was, the, visit, in, 1971, after, the, chinese, group, themselves, independently, solved, the, structure, of, insulin, later, than, hodgkin, s, team, but, to, a, higher, resolution, during, the, subsequent, three, years, 1972, 1975, when, she, was, president, of, the, international, union, of, crystallography, she, was, unable, to, persuade, the, chinese, authorities, however, to, permit, the, country, s, scientists, to, become, members, of, the, union, and, attend, its, meetings, her, relations, with, a, supposed, scientist, in, another, people, s, democracy, had, less, happy, results, at, the, age, of, 73, hodgkin, wrote, a, foreword, to, the, english, edition, of, stereospecific, polymerization, of, isoprene, published, by, robert, maxwell, as, the, work, of, elena, ceau, escu, wife, of, romania, s, communist, dictator, hodgkin, wrote, of, the, author, s, outstanding, achievements, and, impressive, career, following, the, overthrow, of, ceausescu, during, the, romanian, revolution, of, 1989, it, was, revealed, that, elena, ceausescu, had, neither, finished, secondary, school, nor, attended, university, her, scientific, credentials, were, a, hoax, and, the, publication, in, question, was, written, for, her, by, a, team, of, scientists, to, obtain, a, fraudulent, doctorate, because, of, hodgkin, s, political, activities, and, her, husband, s, association, with, the, communist, party, she, was, banned, from, entering, the, us, in, 1953, and, subsequently, not, allowed, to, visit, the, country, except, by, cia, waiver, in, 1961, thomas, became, an, advisor, to, kwame, nkrumah, president, of, ghana, a, country, he, visited, for, extended, periods, before, nkrumah, s, ouster, in, 1966, hodgkin, was, in, ghana, with, her, husband, when, they, received, the, news, that, she, had, been, awarded, the, nobel, prize, she, acquired, from, her, mother, molly, a, concern, about, social, inequalities, and, a, determination, to, do, what, she, could, to, prevent, armed, conflict, dorothy, became, particularly, concerned, about, the, threat, of, nuclear, war, in, 1976, she, became, president, of, the, pugwash, conference, and, served, longer, than, any, who, preceded, or, succeeded, her, in, this, post, she, stepped, down, in, 1988, the, year, after, the, intermediate, range, nuclear, forces, treaty, imposed, a, global, ban, on, short, and, long, range, nuclear, weapons, systems, as, well, as, an, intrusive, verification, regime, she, accepted, the, lenin, peace, prize, from, the, soviet, government, in, 1987, in, recognition, of, her, work, for, peace, and, disarmament, due, to, distance, hodgkin, decided, not, to, attend, the, 1987, congress, of, the, international, union, of, crystallography, in, australia, however, despite, increasing, frailty, she, astounded, close, friends, and, family, by, going, to, beijing, for, the, 1993, congress, where, she, was, welcomed, by, all, she, died, in, july, 1994, after, a, stroke, at, her, husband, s, home, in, the, village, of, ilmington, near, shipston, on, stour, warwickshire, the, national, portrait, gallery, london, lists, 17, portraits, of, dorothy, hodgkin, including, an, oil, painting, of, her, at, her, desk, by, maggi, hambling, and, a, photograph, portrait, by, david, montgomery, graham, sutherland, made, preliminary, sketches, for, a, portrait, of, dorothy, crowfoot, hodgkin, in, 1978, one, sketch, is, in, the, collection, of, the, science, history, institute, and, another, at, the, royal, society, in, london, the, portrait, was, never, finished, a, portrait, of, dorothy, hodgkin, by, bryan, organ, was, commissioned, by, private, subscription, to, become, part, of, the, collection, of, the, royal, society, accepted, by, the, president, of, the, society, on, 25, march, 1982, it, was, the, first, portrait, of, a, woman, fellow, to, be, included, in, the, society, s, collection
