of, novgorod, from, 1010, to, 1034, and, prince, of, rostov, from, 987, to, 1010, uniting, the, principalities, for, a, time, yaroslav, s, baptismal, name, was, george, after, saint, george, yaroslav, was, a, son, of, vladimir, the, great, and, rogneda, of, polotsk, yaroslav, ruled, the, northern, lands, around, rostov, before, being, transferred, to, novgorod, in, 1010, he, had, a, strained, relationship, with, his, father, and, refused, to, pay, tribute, to, kiev, in, 1014, following, vladimir, s, death, in, 1015, yaroslav, waged, a, complicated, war, for, the, kievan, throne, against, his, half, brother, sviatopolk, ultimately, emerging, victorious, in, 1019, as, the, grand, prince, of, kiev, yaroslav, focused, on, foreign, policy, forming, alliances, with, scandinavian, countries, and, weakening, byzantine, influence, on, kiev, he, successfully, captured, the, area, around, present, day, tartu, estonia, establishing, the, fort, of, yuryev, and, forced, nearby, regions, to, pay, tribute, yaroslav, also, defended, his, state, against, nomadic, tribes, such, as, the, pechenegs, by, constructing, a, line, of, forts, he, was, a, patron, of, literary, culture, sponsoring, the, construction, of, saint, sophia, cathedral, in, 1037, and, promoting, the, first, work, of, old, east, slavic, literature, by, hilarion, of, kiev, yaroslav, married, ingegerd, olofsdotter, in, 1019, and, had, several, children, who, married, into, foreign, royal, families, his, children, from, his, second, marriage, went, on, to, rule, various, parts, of, kievan, rus, yaroslav, was, known, for, promoting, unity, among, his, children, and, emphasizing, the, importance, of, living, in, peace, after, his, death, his, body, was, placed, in, a, sarcophagus, within, saint, sophia, s, cathedral, but, his, remains, were, later, lost, or, stolen, yaroslav, s, legacy, includes, founding, several, towns, and, having, numerous, monuments, and, institutions, named, after, him, the, early, years, of, yaroslav, s, life, are, mostly, unknown, he, was, one, of, the, numerous, sons, of, vladimir, the, great, presumably, his, second, by, rogneda, of, polotsk, although, his, actual, age, as, stated, in, the, primary, chronicle, and, corroborated, by, the, examination, of, his, skeleton, in, the, 1930s, would, place, him, among, the, youngest, children, of, vladimir, it, has, been, suggested, that, he, was, a, child, begotten, out, of, wedlock, after, vladimir, s, divorce, from, rogneda, and, marriage, to, anna, porphyrogenita, or, even, that, he, was, a, child, of, anna, porphyrogenita, herself, french, historian, jean, pierre, arrignon, argues, that, he, was, indeed, anna, s, son, as, this, would, explain, his, interference, in, byzantine, affairs, in, 1043, william, humphreys, also, favors, a, reconstruction, making, yaroslav, the, son, rather, than, the, step, son, of, anna, by, invoking, onomastic, arguments, it, is, curious, that, yaroslav, named, his, elder, son, vladimir, after, his, own, father, and, one, of, his, daughters, anna, as, if, after, his, own, mother, there, is, a, certain, pattern, in, his, sons, having, slavic, names, and, his, daughters, having, greek, names, only, furthermore, yaroslav, s, maternity, by, rogneda, of, polotsk, had, been, questioned, by, mykola, kostomarov, in, the, 19th, century, yaroslav, figures, prominently, in, the, norse, sagas, under, the, name, jarisleif, the, lame, his, legendary, lameness, probably, resulting, from, an, arrow, wound, was, corroborated, by, the, scientists, who, examined, his, remains, in, his, youth, yaroslav, was, sent, by, his, father, to, rule, the, northern, lands, around, rostov, he, was, transferred, to, veliky, novgorod, as, befitted, a, senior, heir, to, the, throne, in, 1010, while, living, there, he, founded, the, town, of, yaroslavl, literally, yaroslav, s, on, the, volga, river, his, relations, with, his, father, were, apparently, strained, and, grew, only, worse, on, the, news, that, vladimir, bequeathed, the, kievan, throne, to, his, younger, son, boris, in, 1014, yaroslav, refused, to, pay, tribute, to, kiev, and, only, vladimir, s, death, in, july, 1015, prevented, a, war, during, the, next, four, years, yaroslav, waged, a, complicated, and, bloody, war, for, kiev, against, his, half, brother, sviatopolk, i, of, kiev, who, was, supported, by, his, father, in, law, duke, boles, aw, i, the, brave, king, of, poland, from, 1025, during, the, course, of, this, struggle, several, other, brothers, boris, gleb, and, svyatoslav, were, brutally, murdered, the, primary, chronicle, accused, sviatopolk, of, planning, those, murders, the, saga, eymundar, ttr, hrings, is, often, interpreted, as, recounting, the, story, of, boris, assassination, by, the, varangians, in, the, service, of, yaroslav, however, the, victim, s, name, is, given, there, as, burizaf, which, is, also, a, name, of, boleslaus, i, in, the, scandinavian, sources, it, is, thus, possible, that, the, saga, tells, the, story, of, yaroslav, s, struggle, against, sviatopolk, whose, troops, were, commanded, by, the, polish, duke, and, not, against, boris, yaroslav, defeated, sviatopolk, in, their, first, battle, in, 1016, and, sviatopolk, fled, to, poland, sviatopolk, returned, in, 1018, with, polish, troops, furnished, by, his, father, in, law, seized, kiev, and, pushed, yaroslav, back, into, novgorod, yaroslav, prevailed, over, sviatopolk, and, in, 1019, firmly, established, his, rule, over, kiev, one, of, his, first, actions, as, a, grand, prince, was, to, confer, on, the, loyal, novgorodians, who, had, helped, him, to, gain, the, kievan, throne, numerous, freedoms, and, privileges, thus, the, foundation, of, the, novgorod, republic, was, laid, for, their, part, the, novgorodians, respected, yaroslav, more, than, they, did, other, kievan, princes, and, the, princely, residence, in, their, city, next, to, the, marketplace, and, where, the, veche, often, convened, was, named, yaroslav, s, court, after, him, it, probably, was, during, this, period, that, yaroslav, promulgated, the, first, code, of, laws, in, the, lands, of, the, east, slavs, the, russkaya, pravda, leaving, aside, the, legitimacy, of, yaroslav, s, claims, to, the, kievan, throne, and, his, postulated, guilt, in, the, murder, of, his, brothers, nestor, the, chronicler, and, later, russian, historians, often, presented, him, as, a, model, of, virtue, styling, him, the, wise, a, less, appealing, side, of, his, personality, is, revealed, by, his, having, imprisoned, his, youngest, brother, sudislav, for, life, in, response, another, brother, mstislav, of, chernigov, whose, distant, realm, bordered, the, north, caucasus, and, the, black, sea, hastened, to, kiev, despite, reinforcements, led, by, yaroslav, s, brother, in, law, king, anund, jacob, of, sweden, as, yakun, blind, and, dressed, in, a, gold, suit, or, handsome, and, dressed, in, a, gold, suit, mstislav, inflicted, a, heavy, defeat, on, yaroslav, in, 1024, yaroslav, and, mstislav, then, divided, kievan, rus, between, them, the, area, stretched, east, from, the, dnieper, river, with, the, capital, at, chernigov, was, ceded, to, mstislav, until, his, death, in, 1036, in, his, foreign, policy, yaroslav, relied, on, a, scandinavian, alliance, and, attempted, to, weaken, the, byzantine, influence, on, kiev, according, to, heimskringla, olaf, the, swede, made, an, alliance, with, yaroslav, even, though, the, alliance, was, not, liked, in, sweden, in, order, to, declare, war, against, olaf, ii, of, norway, this, was, sealed, in, 1019, when, king, olof, of, sweden, married, his, daughter, to, yaroslav, instead, of, the, norwegian, king, that, led, to, protests, in, sweden, because, the, swedes, wanted, to, reestablish, control, over, their, lost, eastern, territories, and, bring, in, tribute, from, kievan, rus, as, his, father, eric, the, victorious, had, but, after, years, of, war, against, norway, sweden, no, longer, had, the, power, to, collect, regular, tributes, from, kievan, rus, according, to, heimskringla, in, 1022, olaf, was, deposed, and, forced, to, give, power, to, his, son, anund, jakob, he, defended, the, eastern, countries, from, invaders, ensuring, swedish, military, interests, in, a, successful, military, raid, in, 1030, he, captured, tartu, estonia, and, renamed, it, yuryev, named, after, yury, yaroslav, s, patron, saint, and, forced, the, surrounding, ugandi, county, to, pay, annual, tribute, in, 1031, he, conquered, cherven, cities, from, the, poles, followed, by, the, construction, of, sutiejsk, to, guard, the, newly, acquired, lands, in, c, 1034, yaroslav, concluded, an, alliance, with, polish, king, casimir, i, the, restorer, sealed, by, the, latter, s, marriage, to, yaroslav, s, sister, maria, yaroslav, s, eldest, son, vladimir, ruled, in, novgorod, from, 1034, and, supervised, relations, in, the, north, later, in, yaroslav, s, reign, around, c, 1035, ingvar, the, far, travelled, anund, jakob, s, jarl, sent, swedish, soldiers, into, kievan, rus, due, to, olof, s, son, wanting, to, assist, his, father, s, ally, yaroslav, in, his, wars, against, the, pechenegs, and, byzantines, later, in, c, 1041, anund, jakob, tried, to, reestablish, swedish, control, over, the, eastern, trade, routes, and, reopen, them, the, georgian, annals, report, 1000, men, coming, into, georgia, but, the, original, force, was, likely, much, larger, around, 3, 000, men, ingvar, s, fate, is, unknown, but, he, was, likely, captured, in, battle, during, the, byzantine, campaigns, or, killed, supposedly, in, 1041, only, one, ship, returned, to, sweden, according, to, the, legend, yaroslav, presented, his, second, direct, challenge, to, constantinople, in, 1043, when, a, rus, flotilla, headed, by, one, of, his, sons, appeared, near, constantinople, and, demanded, money, threatening, to, attack, the, city, otherwise, whatever, the, reason, the, greeks, refused, to, pay, and, preferred, to, fight, the, rus, flotilla, defeated, the, byzantine, fleet, but, was, almost, destroyed, by, a, storm, and, came, back, to, kiev, empty, handed, to, defend, his, state, from, the, pechenegs, and, other, nomadic, tribes, threatening, it, from, the, south, he, constructed, a, line, of, forts, composed, of, yuriev, bohuslav, kaniv, korsun, and, pereyaslavl, to, celebrate, his, decisive, victory, over, the, pechenegs, in, 1036, who, thereafter, were, never, a, threat, to, kiev, he, sponsored, the, construction, of, the, saint,

celebrated, monuments, of, his, reign, such, as, the, golden, gate, of, kiev, were, destroyed, during, the, mongol, invasion, of, rus, but, later, restored, yaroslav, was, a, notable, patron, of, literary, culture, and, learning, in, 1051, he, had, a, slavic, monk, hilarion, of, kiev, proclaimed, the, metropolitan, bishop, of, kiev, thus, challenging, the, byzantine, tradition, of, placing, greeks, on, the, episcopal, sees, hilarion, s, discourse, on, yaroslav, and, his, father, vladimir, is, frequently, cited, as, the, first, work, of, old, east, slavic, literature, in, 1019, yaroslav,

opened, and, surprisingly, found, to, contain, only, one, skeleton, that, of, a, female, it, seems, the, documents, detailing, the, 1964, reinterment, of, the, remains, were, falsified, to, hide, the, fact, that, yaroslav, s, remains, had, been, lost, subsequent, questioning, of, individuals, involved, in, the, research, and, reinterment, of, the, remains, seems, to, point, to, the, idea, that, yaroslav, s, remains, were, purposely, hidden, prior, to, the, german, occupation, of, ukraine, and, then, either, lost, completely, or, stolen, and, transported, to, the, united, states, where, many,
