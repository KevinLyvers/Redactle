in, 1557, 1563, the, king, put, in, an, administrative, system, that, reduced, the, power, of, hereditary, shan, saophas, and, brought, shan, customs, in, line, with, lowland, norms, it, eliminated, the, threat, of, shan, raids, into, upper, burma, an, overhanging, concern, since, the, late, 13th, century, his, shan, policy, was, followed, by, burmese, kings, right, up, to, the, final, fall, of, the, kingdom, to, the, british, in, 1885, bayinnaung, could, not, replicate, this, administrative, policy, everywhere, in, his, far, flung, empire, however, his, empire, was, a, loose, collection, of, formerly, sovereign, kingdoms, whose, kings, were, loyal, to, him, as, the, cakkavatti, universal, ruler, rather, than, to, the, kingdom, of, toungoo, itself, indeed, ava, and, siam, revolted, just,

chao, chana, sip, thit, conqueror, of, the, ten, directions, the, future, king, bayinnaung, was, born, ye, htut, ipa, on, 16, january, 1516, to, mingyi, swe, and, shin, myo, myat, his, exact, ancestry, is, unclear, no, extant, contemporary, records, including, hanthawaddy, hsinbyushin, ayedawbon, the, extensive, chronicle, of, the, king, s, reign, written, two, years, before, his, death, mention, his, ancestry, it, was, only, in, 1724, some, 143, years, after, the, king, s, death, that, maha, yazawin, the, official, chronicle, of, the, taungoo, dynasty, first, proclaimed, his, genealogy, according, to, maha, yazawin, he, was, born, to, a, gentry, family, in, toungoo, taungoo, then, a, former, vassal, state, of, the, ava, kingdom, he, was, descended, from, viceroys, of,

tarabya, i, of, pakhan, later, chronicles, simply, repeat, maha, yazawin, s, account, in, all, the, chronicles, perhaps, too, neatly, tie, his, ancestry, to, all, the, previous, main, dynasties, that, existed, in, upper, burma, the, ava, sagaing, myinsaing, pinya, and, pagan, dynasties, despite, the, official, version, of, royal, descent, oral, traditions, speak, of, a, decidedly, less, grandiose, genealogy, that, his, parents, were, commoners, from, ngathayauk, in, pagan, district, or, htihlaing, village, in, toungoo, district, and, that, his, father, was, a, toddy, palm, tree, climber, then, one, of, the, lowest, professions, in, burmese, society, the, commoner, origin, narrative, first, gained, prominence, in, the, early, 20th, century, during, the, british, colonial, period, as, nationalist, writers, like, po, kya, promoted, it, as, proof, that, even, a, son, of, a, toddy, tree, climber, could, rise, to, become, the, great, emperor, in, burmese, society, to, be, sure, the, chronicle, and, oral, traditions, need, not, be, mutually, exclusive, since, being, a, toddy, tree, climber, does, not, preclude, his, having, royal, ancestors, whatever, their, origin, and, station, in, life, may, have, been, both, of, his, parents, were, chosen, to, be, part, of, the, seven, person, staff, to, take, care, of, the, royal, baby, tabinshwehti, in, april, 1516, ye, htut, s, mother,

its, former, ally, prome, in, 1532, 1533, tabinshwehti, and, the, toungoo, leadership, concluded, that, their, kingdom, had, to, act, quickly, if, it, wished, to, avoid, being, swallowed, up, by, the, confederation, it, was, during, the, kingdom, s, mobilizations, that, ye, htut, made, his, mark, and, was, noticed, for, his, deeds, of, valor, and, strength, of, character, ye, htut, was, by, the, king, s, side, in, 1532, when, the, king, and, his, 500, most, skillful, horsemen, made, an, uninvited, foray, into, the, shwemawdaw, pagoda, at, the, outskirts, of, pegu, the, capital, of,

companion, and, adviser, to, the, young, king, however, the, close, relationship, between, the, two, was, severely, tested, in, 1534, as, they, prepared, for, war, against, hanthawaddy, ye, htut, had, become, romantically, involved, with, thakin, gyi, the, king, s, younger, half, sister, and, the, affair, was, discovered, around, april, 1534, the, commoner, s, affair, with, the, king, s, sister, under, burmese, law, constituted, an, act, of, treason, ye, htut, spurned, suggestions, of, mutiny, and, submitted, to, arrest, tabinshwehti, deliberated, at, length, with, his, ministers, and, finally, came, to, the, conclusion, that, ye, htut, should, be, given, his, sister, in, marriage, and, a, princely, title, of, kyawhtin, nawrahta, with, this, decision, tabinshwehti, won, the, loyalty, of, his, brother, in, law, without, parallel, in, burmese, history, tabinshwehti, s, decision, would, pay, enormous, dividends, in, the, following, years, between, 1534, and, 1549, toungoo, would, bring, war, to, all, its, neighbors, and, in, the, process, found, the, largest, polity, in, burma, since, the, fall, of, pagan, in, 1287, ye, htut, would, win, many, key, battles, for, his, king, and, help, administer, the, growing, kingdom, in, late, 1534, toungoo, attacked, hanthawaddy, the, larger, wealthier, but, disunited, kingdom, to, their, south, it, was, toungoo, s, gambit, to, break, out, of, its, narrow, landlocked, realm, before, the, confederation, s, attention, turned, to, the, last, remaining, holdout, in, upper, burma, while, toungoo, did, not, yet, have, any, foreign, firearms, due, to, receiving, a, constant, flow, of, refugees, from, elsewhere, in, upper, burma, for, the, last, three, decades, toungoo, did, have, more, manpower, than, it, normally, could, have, enlisted, tabinshwehti, and, ye, htut, now, styled, as, kyawhtin, nawrahta, were, to, cut, their, teeth, in, failure, however, their, maiden, annual, dry, season, campaigns, 1534, 1537, all, failed, against, pegu, s, well, armed, heavily, fortified, defenses, but, their, performance, got, better, with, each, successive, campaign, penetrating, deeper, and, deeper, into, hanthawaddy, territory, they, finally, broke, through, in, their, 1538, 1539, campaign, and, captured, pegu, kyawhtin, nawrahta, made, his, name, in, the, battle, of, naungyo, in, which, his, light, forces, decisively, defeated, numerically, superior, hanthawaddy, forces, in, the, irrawaddy, delta, the, battle, one, of, the, most, famous, in, burmese, military, history, has, been, called, the, first, characteristic, touch, of, the, great, bayinnaung, after, the, battle, a, grateful, tabinshwehti, bestowed, upon, his, brother, in, law, the, title, of, bayinnaung, king, s, elder, brother, the, name, by, which, he, would, be, remembered, toungoo, went, on, to, conquer, all, of, hanthawaddy, by, mid, 1541, gaining, complete, control, of, lower, burma, s, manpower, access, to, foreign, firearms, and, maritime, wealth, to, pay, for, them, and, tabinshwehti, would, use, these, new, assets, for, further, expansions, by, incorporating, portuguese, mercenaries, firearms, and, military, tactics, into, the, toungoo, armed, forces, tabinshwehti, and, bayinnaung, continued, to, grow, as, military, leaders, the, duo, also, benefited, from, having, experienced, former, hanthawaddy, military, commanders, like, saw, lagun, ein, and, smim, payu, serve, as, their, top, military, advisers, and, generals, with, their, help, bayinnaung, delivered, key, decisive, victories, at, the, battle, of, padaung, pass, 1542, against, prome, s, ally, arakan, and, the, battle, of, salin, 1544, against, the, confederation, enabling, toungoo, to, take, over, central, burma, as, far, north, as, pagan, bagan, after, bayinnaung, crushed, the, arakanese, forces, in, april, 1542, tabinshwehti, was, so, pleased, with, the, victory, that, he, made, bayinnaung, the, heir, apparent, of, the, kingdom, the, duo, s, later, campaigns, against, arakan, 1545, 1547, and, siam, 1547, 1549, however, fell, short, in, both, campaigns, toungoo, forces, won, all, major, open, battles, and, went, on, to, lay, siege, to, the, capitals, mrauk, u, and, ayutthaya, respectively, but, they, still, had, no, answer, to, heavily, fortified, defenses, equipped, with, portuguese, firearms, and, had, to, retreat, both, times, toungoo, s, own, portuguese, supplied, cannon, had, little, impact, on, the, walls, of, both, capitals, nor, did, they, have, enough, manpower, 19, 000, and, 12, 000, troops, respectively, in, the, arakanese, and, siamese, campaigns, for, long, term, sieges, nonetheless, despite, the, setbacks, tabinshwehti, and, bayinnaung, had, by, 1549, built, up, the, largest, polity, in, burma, since, the, fall, of, the, pagan, empire, in, 1287, stretching, from, pagan, in, the, north, to, tavoy, in, the, south, bayinnaung, was, also, entrusted, to, administer, the, kingdom, tabinshwehti, appointed, him, chief, minister, in, 1539, in, the, then, prevailing, administrative, model, the, role, of, the, prime, minister, was, limited, to, managing, and, coordinating, semi, independent, tributaries, autonomous, viceroys, and, governors, who, actually, had, control, over, day, to, day, administration, and, manpower, trusted, local, rulers, like, smim, payu, and, saw, lagun, ein, were, appointed, by, the, king, to, assist, bayinnaung, with, central, administration, in, 1549, tabinshwehti, who, had, developed, a, liking, to, wine, gave, up, all, administrative, duties, to, bayinnaung, and, spent, much, of, his, time, on, long, hunting, trips, away, from, the, capital, concerned, by, the, king, s, erratic, behavior, ministers, at, the, court, urged, bayinnaung, to, take, over, the, throne, but, he, declined, saying, he, would, try, to, win, back, the, king, to, his, old, sense, of, duty, to, his, own, kingdom, he, was, unsuccessful, even, when, faced, with, a, serious, rebellion, by, smim, htaw, the, king, asked, bayinnaung, in, january, 1550, to, suppress, the, rebellion, and, went, on, another, months, long, hunting, trip, on, 30, april, 1550, tabinshwehti, was, assassinated, by, his, own, bodyguards, on, the, order, of, smim, sawhtut, one, of, the, king, s, close, advisers, smim, sawhtut, naturally, proclaimed, himself, king, but, so, did, all, other, major, governors, and, viceroys, including, bayinnaung, s, own, brother, minkhaung, ii, although, bayinnaung, had, been, tabinshwehti, s, chosen, heir, apparent, since, 1542, none, of, them, acknowledged, bayinnaung, as, the, rightful, successor, when, bayinnaung, received, the, news, of, the, assassination, he, was, in, dala, modern, yangon, chasing, after, smim, htaw, s, rebel, forces, the, toungoo, empire, which, he, had, helped, found, and, expand, for, the, last, 16, years, lay, in, ruins, he, as, a, colonial, era, historian, noted, was, a, king, without, a, kingdom, bayinnaung, would, have, to, rebuild, the, kingdom, all, anew, at, dala, with, few, but, faithful, troops, he, plotted, his, next, moves, his, two, eldest, younger, brothers, minye, sithu, and, thado, dhamma, yaza, ii, were, with, him, and, remained, loyal, also, in, his, service, was, an, ethnic, mon, commander, named, binnya, dala, who, would, become, his, most, trusted, adviser, and, best, commander, because, he, did, not, yet, have, any, foreign, mercenaries, who, could, handle, firearms, he, sent, for, his, favorite, portuguese, mercenary, diogo, soares, de, mello, who, had, greatly, impressed, him, in, the, siamese, campaign, soares, who, was, abroad, returned, with, his, men, all, 39, of, them, and, he, was, warmly, received, by, bayinnaung, two, months, after, the, assassination, bayinnaung, was, ready, to, start, the, restoration, project, he, faced, the, following, adversaries, after, much, deliberation, bayinnaung, and, his, advisers, decided, that, their, war, of, restoration, would, begin, at, toungoo, the, original, home, of, the, dynasty, it, was, a, calculated, gamble, since, they, would, have, to, pass, through, the, heart, of, pegu, controlled, territory, but, they, decided, to, take, the, gamble, because, they, felt, bayinnaung, would, find, the, best, support, in, his, native, toungoo, rather, than, deep, in, the, mon, country, they, found, themselves, in, in, late, june, bayinnaung, and, his, small, but, cohesive, unit, of, fighting, men, left, dala, for, toungoo, they, marched, north, to, hinthada, and, then, crossed, over, to, the, eastern, side, of, bago, yoma, north, of, pegu, smim, sawhtut, now, king, of, pegu, came, out, with, his, army, to, stop, them, bayinnaung, as, recounted, by, the, chronicles, paid, no, more, heed, than, a, lion, does, to, jackals, and, marched, on, discovering, that, bayinnaung, s, target, was, not, pegu, sawhtut, did, not, engage, them, bayinnaung, set, up, camp, at, zeyawaddy, 50, km, 31, miles, outside, of, toungoo, once, there, bayinnaung, received, many, of, the, ministers, and, soldiers, of, tabinshwehti, s, old, court, who, fled, pegu, and, martaban, the, new, arrivals, were, of, all, ethnic, backgrounds, burmans, shans, and, mons, demonstrating, that, in, 16th, century, burma, vertical, patron, client, structures, often, preempted, horizontal, ones, even, those, as, strong, as, ethnic, identity, and, cultures, by, late, august, he, had, collected, a, serious, fighting, force, 9600, men, 200, horses, 20, elephants, 200, war, boats, his, land, and, naval, forces,

execution, of, prome, s, ruler, thado, dhamma, yaza, i, but, regretted, the, decision, immediately, afterwards, he, appointed, his, second, eldest, younger, brother, as, viceroy, of, prome, with, the, style, of, thado, dhamma, yaza, ii, bayinnaung, then, proceeded, to, complete, the, conquest, of, northernmost, central, burma, up, to, pagan, bagan, by, mid, september, 1551, he, appointed, his,

forced, to, withdraw, speedily, as, pegu, forces, marched, toward, toungoo, pegu, s, forces, withdrew, from, his, territory, but, bayinnaung, now, decided, that, pegu, must, be, eliminated, first,

september, 1573, according, to, g, e, harvey, however, the, kotte, king, s, action, was, not, voluntary, the, burmese, king, had, demanded, a, princess, to, fulfill, a, prophecy, given, by, his, astrologers, and, dharmapala, who, had, no, daughters, complied, by, sending, the, daughter, of, a, chamberlain, whom, he, had, treated, as, his, own, at, any, rate, dharmapala, who, had, converted, to, catholicism, continued, to, curry, favor, by, sending, what, he, claimed, was, the, real, tooth, relic, ostensibly, to, be, safeguarded, under, the, protection, of, the, great, buddhist, king, the, main, purpose, of, his, mission, was, to, seek, military, help, against, a, rebellion, the, tooth, was, received, on, 14, july, 1576, while, it, is, unclear, whether, bayinnaung, actually, believed, in, the, authenticity, of, the, relic, the, possession, of, a, holy, tooth, which, many, millions, of, subjects, believed, in, was, of, the, highest, importance, in, return, bayinnaung, sent, 2500, of, his, best, invulnerables, from, all, parts, of, the, empire, in, five, ships, to, colombo, the, king, s, best, troops, easily, defeated, the, rebellion, which, was, noticed, by, the, other, three, rulers, on, the, island, chronicles, say, that, the, burmese, generals, then, received, the, rulers, of, the, four, kingdoms, of, ceylon, in, colombo, and, instructed, them, to, safeguard, the, religion, king, karaliyadde, bandara, of, kandy, offered, a, daughter, and, what, he, claimed, was, the, real, tooth, but, his, majesty, seeing, no, reason, to, reopen, the, case, would, not, enter, into, controversy, with, skeptics, and, dismissed, them, with, thanks, no, troubles, arose, when, queen, visuddhadevi, of, lan, na, who, had, successfully, kept, the, middle, tai, country, quiet, for, over, 13, years, died, on, 2, january, 1579, bayinnaung, s, choice, nawrahta, minsaw, one, of, his, sons, faced, no, problems, taking, over, the, lan, na, throne, when, instabilities, arose, in, lan, xang, he, took, no, chances, on, 17, october, 1579, he, sent, a, sizable, army, 22, 000, men, 1200, horses, 120, elephants, which, faced, no, opposition, according, to, laotian, history, the, vassal, king, of, lan, xang, maha, ouparat, died, in, 1580, and, bayinnaung, installed, sen, soulintha, the, usurper, whom, he, had, kept, in, pegu, since, 1574, as, the, successor, the, burmese, chronicles, make, no, mention, of, any, change, for, the, rest, of, the, king, s, reign, the, chronicles, lone, post, 1579, entry, on, lan, xang, during, his, reign, simply, states, that, on, 2, september, 1581, the, king, commissioned, a, buddhist, pagoda, in, lan, xang, the, chronicles, say, that, the, vassal, king, died, in, september, october, 1588, by, 1580, not, only, had, the, universal, ruler, subdued, all, the, countries, which, had, occupied, his, attention, for, the, last, three, decades, but, he, also, had, the, respect, of, neighboring, states, he, faced, no, internal, or, external, threats, although, portuguese, goa, considered, itself, technically, at, war, with, burma, for, her, interference, in, ceylon, instead, of, resting, he, turned, his, gaze, on, arakan, the, kingdom, he, and, tabinshwehti, unsuccessfully, tried, to, conquer, in, 1545, 1547, he, determined, that, it, was, now, time, to, reduce, the, western, coastal, kingdom, to, the, vassal, status, it, held, under, the, pagan, kings, once, more, a, year, earlier, he, had, sent, an, embassy, to, emperor, akbar, of, the, mughal, empire, which, had, just, acquired, bengal, in, 1576, perhaps, to, ascertain, whether, his, occupation, of, arakan, would, be, viewed, as, an, act, of, hostility, to, the, mughals, at, any, rate, the, king, sent, an, 8000, strong, naval, invasion, force, on, 15, october, 1580, the, fleet, which, consisted, of, 200, ships, went, on, to, occupy, sandoway, in, november, 1580, the, king, had, probably, planned, to, lead, the, assault, on, the, arakanese, capital, mrauk, u, by, himself, but, could, not, because, of, his, failing, health, the, invasion, force, remained, inactive, at, sandoway, for, a, year, the, king, sent, additional, land, and, naval, forces, 29, 000, troops, 1600, horses, 120, elephants, on, 28, august, 1581, in, preparation, for, the, coming, dry, season, campaign, but, the, king, died, six, weeks, later, and, the, invasion, forces, withdrew, soon, after, bayinnaung, successfully, assembled, the, largest, empire, in, burmese, history, the, empire, spanned, from, manipur, to, cambodian, marches, and, the, borders, of, arakan, to, yunnan, and, likely, received, propitiatory, homage, from, states, as, far, east, as, vietnam, and, cambodia, notwithstanding, its, fragility, his, realm, was, certainly, the, largest, empire, in, the, history, of, mainland, southeast, asia, and, probably, the, largest, empire, in, the, history, of, southeast, asia, the, portuguese, called, pegu, the, most, powerful, monarchy, in, asia, except, that, of, china, but, bayinnaung, who, began, his, reign, as, a, king, without, a, kingdom, ended, his, reign, as, an, emperor, without, an, empire, according, to, than, tun, bayinnaung, conquered, territories, not, to, colonize, them, but, to, gain, the, loyalty, of, their, rulers, he, kept, conquered, kings, and, lords, in, their, own, positions, so, long, as, they, remained, loyal, to, him, tun, aung, chain, adds, that, the, extensive, polity, was, held, together, not, so, much, by, formal, institutions, as, personal, relationships, based, on, the, concepts, of, thissa, allegiance, and, kyezu, obligation, lieberman, writes, he, presented, himself, as, cakkavatti, or, world, ruler, par, excellence, this, was, nothing, new, the, king, was, simply, following, the, then, prevailing, southeast, asian, administrative, model, of, solar, polities, in, which, the, high, king, ruled, the, core, while, semi, independent, tributaries, autonomous, viceroys, and, governors, actually, controlled, day, to, day, administration, and, manpower, as, such, the, king, of, kings, governed, only, pegu, and, the, mon, country, himself, leaving, the, rest, of, the, realm, to, vassal, kings, in, ava, prome, lan, na, lan, xang, martaban, siam, and, toungoo, he, regarded, lan, na, as, the, most, important, of, all, the, vassal, states, and, spent, much, time, there, he, administered, lower, burma, with, the, help, of, ministers, the, vast, majority, of, whom, were, of, ethnic, mon, background, the, word, used, by, european, visitors, to, describe, a, court, official, was, semini, italian, translation, of, smim, mon, for, lord, his, chief, minister, was, binnya, dala, known, for, his, military, and, administrative, abilities, and, literary, talents, he, introduced, administrative, reforms, only, at, the, margins, by, and, large, he, simply, grafted, the, prevailing, decentralized, administration, system, which, barely, worked, for, petty, states, like, his, native, toungoo, to, the, largest, polity, ever, in, the, region, indeed, it, did, not, work, for, mid, size, kingdoms, like, ava, hanthawaddy, lan, na, and, siam, ava, had, always, had, to, contend, with, prome, and, toungoo, pegu, with, martaban, and, bassein, chiang, mai, with, chiang, saen, and, nan, ayutthaya, with, phitsanulok, etc, now, because, of, the, sheer, size, of, the, empire, the, system, was, even, more, decentralized, and, stretched, thinner, still, at, any, rate, it, was, the, only, system, the, toungoo, kings, knew, and, they, had, no, choice, but, to, retain, it, he, perhaps, inadvertently, did, introduce, a, key, reform, which, turned, out, to, be, the, most, important, and, most, enduring, of, his, legacies, it, was, his, policy, to, administer, the, shan, states, which, had, constantly, raided, upper, burma, since, the, late, 13th, century, the, king, permitted, the, saophas, of, the, states, to, retain, their, royal, regalia, and, ceremonies, and, feudal, rights, over, their, subjects, the, office, of, the, saopha, remained, hereditary, but, the, incumbent, saopha, could, now, be, removed, by, the, king, for, gross, misconduct, although, the, king, s, choice, of, successor, was, limited, to, members, of, the, saopha, s, own, family, the, key, innovation, was, that, he, required, sons, of, his, vassal, rulers, to, reside, in, his, palace, as, pages, who, served, a, dual, purpose, they, were, hostages, for, good, conduct, of, their, fathers, and, they, received, valuable, training, in, burmese, court, life, his, shan, policy, was, followed, by, all, burmese, kings, right, up, to, the, final, fall, of, the, kingdom, to, the, british, in, 1885, still, his, reforms, were, ad, hoc, and, experimental, patron, client, relationships, still, mattered, much, more, than, weak, or, non, existent, institutions, his, vassals, were, loyal, to, him, not, toungoo, burma, the, reforms, he, started, would, ultimately, be, expanded, by, his, 17th, century, successors, but, they, had, not, sufficiently, taken, root, by, his, death, to, prevent, his, overheated, empire, from, rapidly, collapsing, in, the, next, two, decades, his, majesty, introduced, a, measure, of, legal, uniformity, by, summoning, learned, monks, and, officials, from, all, over, his, dominions, to, prescribe, an, official, collection, of, law, books, the, scholars, compiled, dhammathat, kyaw, and, kosaungchok, based, on, king, wareru, s, dhammathat, the, decisions, given, in, his, court, were, collected, in, hanthawaddy, hsinbyumyashin, hpyat, hton, he, promoted, the, new, law, throughout, the, empire, so, far, as, it, was, compatible, with, customs, and, practices, of, local, society, the, adoption, of, burmese, customary, law, and, the, burmese, calendar, in, siam, began, in, his, reign, he, also, standardized, the, weights, and, measurements, such, as, the, cubit, tical, basket, throughout, the, realm, another, enduring, legacy, of, bayinnaung, was, his, introduction, of, a, more, orthodox, theravada, buddhism, to, upper, burma, and, the, shan, states, he, propagated, the, religious, reforms, begun, by, king, dhammazedi, in, the, late, 1470s, viewing, himself, as, the, model, buddhist, king, the, king, distributed, copies, of, the, scriptures, fed, monks, and, built, pagodas, at, every, new, conquered, state, from, upper, burma, and, the, shan, states, to, lan, na, and, siam, some, of, the, pagodas, are, still, to, be, seen, and, in, later, ages, the, burmese, would, point, to, them, as, proof, of, their, claim, to, rule, those, countries, still, following, in, the, footsteps, of, dhammazedi, he, supervised, mass, ordinations, at, the, kalyani, ordination, hall, at, pegu, in, his, orthodox, theravada, buddhism, in, the, name, of, purifying, the, religion, he, prohibited, all, human, and, animal, sacrifices, throughout, the, kingdom, in, particular, he, forbade, the, shan, practice, of, killing, the, slaves, and, animals, belonging, to, a, saopha, at, his, funeral, his, attempts, to, rid, of, animist, nat, worship, from, buddhism, however, failed, he, donated, jewels, to, adorn, the, crowns, of, many, a, pagoda, including, the, shwedagon, the, shwemawdaw, the, kyaiktiyo, and, many, less, famous, ones, he, added, a, new, spire, to, the, shwedagon, in, 1564, after, the, death, of, his, beloved, queen, yaza, dewi, his, main, temple, was, the, mahazedi, pagoda, at, pegu, completed, in, 1561, he, tried, but, failed, to, secure, the, release, of, the, tooth, relic, of, kandy, from, the, portuguese, invaders, in, 1560, he, later, interfered, with, the, internal, affairs, of, ceylon, in, the, 1570s, ostensibly, to, protect, the, buddha, sasana, there, his, kingdom, was, mainly, an, agrarian, state, with, a, few, wealthy, maritime, trading, ports, the, main, ports, were, syriam, thanlyin, dala, and, martaban, the, kingdom, exported, commodities, such, as, rice, and, jewels, at, pegu, overseas, trade, was, in, the, hands, of, eight, brokers, appointed, by, the, king, their, fee, was, two, percent, their, honesty, and, businesslike, methods, won, the, esteem, of, european, merchants, the, wealth, was, seen, at, the, capital, contemporary, european, travelers, would, never, tire, of, describing, pegu, the, long, moat, full, of, crocodiles, the, walls, the, watch, towers, the, gorgeous, palace, the, great, processions, with, elephants, and, palanquins, and, grandees, in, shining, robes, the, shrines, filled, with, images, of, massy, gold, and, gems, the, unending, hosts, of, armed, men, and, the, apparition, of, the, great, king, himself, the, king, appointed, officials, to, supervise, merchant, shipping, and, sent, out, ships, to, undertake, commercial, voyages, the, prosperous, life, at, the, capital, however, was, probably, not, replicated, at, the, countryside, annual, mobilizations, of, men, greatly, reduced, the, manpower, necessary, to, cultivate, the, rice, fields, harvests, at, times, fell, perilously, low, causing, severe, rice, shortages, such, as, in, 1567, bayinnaung, built, the, largest, empire, in, southeast, asia, on, the, back, of, breathtaking, military, conquests, his, success, has, been, attributed, to, a, more, martial, toungoo, tradition, portuguese, firearms, foreign, mercenaries, and, larger, forces, first, he, was, a, product, of, toungoo, a, rebellion, prone, former, vassal, of, ava, where, he, as, a, young, man, at, the, palace, received, a, military, style, education, since, childhood, with, their, training, he, and, tabinshwehti, launched, their, first, campaign, against, a, larger, wealthier, hanthawaddy, when, they, were, both, just, 18, secondly, the, beginning, of, their, military, careers, coincided, with, the, arrival, of, portuguese, cannon, and, matchlocks, in, large, quantities, portuguese, weaponry, proved, superior, in, accuracy, safety, ballistic, weight, and, rapidity, of, fire, to, asian, made, firearms, the, duo, arrived, at, the, coast, on, the, cusp, of, this, transformation, and, quickly, turned, it, to, their, advantage, incorporating, portuguese, firearms, as, well, as, portuguese, and, indian, ocean, mostly, muslim, mercenaries, into, their, forces, indigenous, infantry, and, elephant, units, also, began, using, guns, with, 20, 33, of, the, troops, so, equipped, on, some, late, 16th, century, campaigns, according, to, lieberman, had, toungoo, attacked, pegu, a, generation, later, it, is, conceivable, that, portuguese, guns, could, have, given, pegu, the, victory, thus, altering, the, course, of, history, but, it, was, toungoo, that, seized, hanthawaddy, s, advantages, and, leveraged, them, into, an, empire, finally, bayinnaung, was, able, to, marshal, more, manpower, than, any, ruler, in, the, region, he, required, every, new, conquered, state, to, provide, conscripts, for, his, next, campaign, using, both, larger, forces, and, superior, firearms, he, had, no, trouble, reducing, manipur, and, the, entire, shan, world, to, tributary, status, his, larger, forces, and, their, greater, fighting, experience, proved, to, make, the, difference, against, siam, which, too, was, a, wealthy, coastal, power, with, a, powerful, well, equipped, military, it, turned, out, however, that, siam, was, not, his, greatest, adversary, it, was, the, remote, mountainous, states, like, lan, xang, mohnyin, and, mogaung, whose, guerrilla, warfare, gave, him, constant, trouble, many, of, his, men, died, from, starvation, and, disease, while, fruitlessly, searching, for, elusive, bands, of, rebels, year, after, year, the, death, toll, must, have, been, significant, since, it, made, it, to, the, chronicles, he, was, fortunate, that, the, charismatic, guerrilla, leader, setthathirath, died, in, the, end, his, military, might, alone, could, not, bring, lasting, peace, he, needed, competent, local, rulers, who, commanded, the, respect, of, the, local, populace, to, rule, the, lands, on, his, behalf, history, shows, that, he, used, the, political, solution, instead, to, maintain, peace, to, be, sure, the, individual, ingredients, alone, cannot, explain, his, success, the, same, ingredients, were, available, to, his, successors, yet, no, one, in, burma, or, elsewhere, in, the, successor, states, of, his, empire, could, put, them, together, for, example, he, raised, upwards, of, 60, 000, to, 70, 000, men, for, his, major, campaigns, his, toungoo, successors, raised, a, third, at, most, it, was, not, until, the, early, konbaung, kings, that, the, army, again, raised, nearly, as, many, men, harvey, notes, from, his, teens, until, his, death, he, was, constantly, in, the, field, leading, every, major, campaign, in, person, the, failure, of, other, kings, who, attempted, the, same, conquests, is, the, measure, of, his, ability, the, king, died, on, 10, october, 1581, after, a, long, illness, his, full, reign, name, at, death, was, thiri, tri, bawa, naditra, pawara, pandita, thudhamma, yaza, maha, dipadi, his, eldest, son, and, heir, apparent, nanda, took, over, the, throne, without, incident, but, the, empire, which, bayinnaung, had, built, on, military, conquests, and, maintained, by, both, military, power, and, personal, relationships, with, the, vassal, rulers, was, to, crumble, soon, after, the, first, crack, appeared, in, the, far, north, in, september, 1582, when, the, chinese, shan, states, of, sanda, and, thaungthut, revolted, the, rebellion, was, put, down, in, march, 1583, much, more, serious, cracks, followed, ava, upper, burma, revolted, in, october, 1583, and, the, rebellion, was, put, down, on, 24, april, 1584, siam, revolted, on, 3, may, 1584, nanda, would, spend, the, rest, of, his, reign, fighting, siam, and, other, former, vassals, and, would, lose, the, entire, empire, in, the, process, by, 1599, the, king, had, three, principal, queens, consort, and, over, 50, other, junior, queens, in, all, he, left, 97, children, the, following, is, a, list, of, notable, queens, and, their, issue, a, notable, queen, of, bayinnaung, in, thai, history, is, suphankanlaya, daughter, of, king, maha, thammarachathirat, of, siam, bayinnaung, is, considered, one, of, the, three, greatest, burmese, kings, alongside, anawrahta, and, alaungpaya, the, founders, of, the, first, and, third, burmese, empires, respectively, the, king, is, mostly, remembered, for, his, military, conquests, not, just, in, myanmar, but, also, in, thailand, and, laos, his, reign, has, been, called, the, greatest, explosion, of, human, energy, ever, seen, in, burma, in, myanmar, the, soldier, king, is, considered, the, favorite, king, of, the, present, day, burmese, generals, according, to, thant, myint, u, the, generals, often, see, themselves, as, fighting, the, same, enemies, and, in, the, same, places, their, soldiers, slugging, their, way, through, the, same, thick, jungle, preparing, to, torch, a, town, or, press, gang, villagers, the, past, closer, more, comparable, a, way, to, justify, present, action, his, statues, are, there, because, the, ordeal, of, welding, a, nation, together, by, force, is, not, just, history, in, thailand, he, is, well, known, as, the, conqueror, of, the, ten, directions, from, the, 1931, novel, phu, chana, sip, thit, conqueror, of, the, ten, directions, by, chote, praepan, he, has, thus, far, escaped, the, increasingly, negative, portrayals, of, burmese, kings, in, thai, history, books, as, the, founder, of, an, empire, geographically, centered, in, siam, he, is, well, known, by, the, thai, people, and, often, still, treated, with, respect, in, laos, king, setthathirath, is, lionized, for, his, pesky, resistance, to, the, empire, though, he, is, best, known, for, empire, building, his, greatest, legacy, was, his, integration, of, the, shan, states, which, eliminated, the, threat, of, shan, raids, into, upper, burma, an, overhanging, concern, to, upper, burma, since, the, late, 13th, century, his, shan, policy, greatly, enhanced, by, later, toungoo, kings, reduced, the, power, of, hereditary, saophas, and, brought, hill, customs, in, line, with, low, land, norms, this, policy, was, followed, by, burmese, kings, right, up, to, the, final, fall, of, the, kingdom, to, the, british, in, 1885, the, adoption, of, burmese, customary, law, and,
