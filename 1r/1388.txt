known, generically, as, bakufu, ended, almost, all, western, trade, with, japan, and, barred, christian, missionaries, from, the, islands, under, the, sakoku, edict, of, 1635, in, addition, to, the, substantial, chinese, trade, only, the, dutch, continued, trade, with, japan, maintaining, a, post, on, the, island, of, dejima, by, nagasaki, however, by, the, early, 19th, century, european, and,

property, at, the, north, end, of, the, gosho, at, the, time, birth, was, culturally, believed, to, be, a, source, of, pollution, so, the, imperial, prince, was, not, born, in, the, palace, instead, it, was, common, for, members, of, the, imperial, family, to, be, born, in, a, structure, often, temporary, near, the, pregnant, woman, s, father, s, house, the, prince, mutsuhito, s, mother, nakayama, yoshiko, was, a, concubine, japanese, romanized, gon, no, tenji, to, his, father, emperor, k, mei, and, she, was, the, daughter, of, the, acting, major, counselor, nakayama, tadayasu, the, young, prince, was, given, the, title, sachi, no, miya, or, prince, sachi, the, young, prince, was, born, into, an, era, of, great, change, in, japan, this, change, was, symbolised, dramatically, in, july, 1853, when, commodore, matthew, perry, and, his, american, naval, squadron, what, the, japanese, dubbed, the, black, ships, sailed, into, the, harbour, at, edo, known, since, 1868, as, tokyo, perry, sought, to, open, japan, up, to, international, trade, and, showcased, the, modern, cannons, that, his, naval, fleet, equipped, for, the, first, time, in, at, least, 250, years, the, shogunate, took, the, highly, unusual, step, of, consulting, with, the, imperial, court, because, of, the, crisis, brought, on, by, perry, s, arrival, emperor, k, mei, s, officials, advised, that, they, felt, they, should, agree, to, trade, with, the, americans, and, asked, that, they, be, informed, in, advance, of, any, steps, to, be, taken, upon, perry, s, return, the, japanese, government, decided, that, their, military, was, no, match, for, the, american, military, and, thus, allowed, trade, and, submitted, to, what, it, dubbed, the, unequal, treaties, unequal, treaties, meant, giving, up, tariff, authority, and, the, right, to, try, foreigners, in, its, own, courts, the, shogunate, s, willingness, to, consult, with, the, court, was, short, lived, in, 1858, word, of, a, treaty, arrived, with, a, letter, stating, that, due, to, shortness, of, time, it, had, not, been, possible, to, consult, emperor, k, mei, was, so, incensed, that, he, threatened, to, abdicate, though, even, this, action, would, have, required, the, consent, of, the, sh, gun, much, of, the, emperor, s, boyhood, is, known, only, through, later, accounts, which, his, biographer, donald, keene, points, out, are, often, contradictory, one, contemporary, described, mutsuhito, as, healthy, and, strong, somewhat, of, a, bully, and, exceptionally, talented, at, sumo, another, states, that, the, prince, was,

many, daimy, s, were, increasingly, dissatisfied, with, bakufu, handling, foreign, affairs, large, numbers, of, young, samurai, known, as, shishi, or, men, of, high, purpose, began, to, meet, and, speak, against, the, shogunate, the, shishi, revered, emperor, k, mei, and, favoured, direct, violent, action, to, cure, societal, ills, while, they, initially, desired, the, death, or, expulsion, of, all, foreigners, the, shishi, would, later, begin, to, advocate, the, modernisation, of, the, country, the, bakufu, enacted, several, measures, to, appease, the, various, groups, in, an, effort, to, drive, a, wedge, between, the, shishi, and, daimy, s, kyoto, was, a, major, centre, for, the, shishi, and, the, shishi, had, influence, over, the, emperor, k, mei, in, 1863, the, shishi, persuaded, him, to, issue, an, order, to, expel, barbarians, the, order, placed, the, shogunate, in, a, difficult, position, since, they, had, no, intention, of, enforcing, the, order, because, they, did, not, have, the, power, to, carry, it, out, several, attacks, were, made, on, foreigners, or, their, ships, and, foreign, forces, retaliated, bakufu, forces, were, able, to, drive, most, of, the, shishi, out, of, kyoto, and, an, attempt, by, them, to, return, in, 1864, was, driven, back, nevertheless, unrest, continued, throughout, japan, the, prince, s, awareness, of, the, political, turmoil, is, uncertain, during, this, time, he, studied, waka, poetry, first, with, his, father, then, with, the, court, poets, in, 1866, a, new, sh, gun, tokugawa, yoshinobu, took, office, as, the, prince,

resistance, from, among, the, bakufu, even, as, unrest, and, military, actions, continued, in, mid, 1866, a, bakufu, army, set, forth, to, punish, rebels, in, southern, japan, the, army, was, defeated, emperor, k, mei, fell, seriously, ill, at, the, age, of, 36, and, died, on, 30, january, 1867, british, diplomat, sir, ernest, satow, wrote, it, is, impossible, to, deny, that,

ascended, to, the, throne, on, 13, february, 1867, the, new, emperor, continued, his, classical, education, which, did, not, include, matters, of, politics, in, the, meantime, the, sh, gun, yoshinobu, struggled, to, maintain, power, he, repeatedly, asked, for, the, emperor, s, confirmation, of, his, actions, which, he, eventually, received, but, there, is, no, indication, that, the, young, emperor, was, himself, involved, in, the, decisions, the, shishi, and, other, rebels, continued, to, shape, their, vision, of, the, new, japan, and, although, they, revered, the, emperor, they, had, no, thought, of, having, him, play, an, active, part, in, the, political, process, the, political, struggle, reached, its, climax, in, late, 1867, an, agreement, was, reached, by, which, yoshinobu, would, maintain, his, title, and, some, of, his, power, but, the, lawmaking, power, would, be, vested, in, a, bicameral, legislature, based, on, the, british, model, the, agreement, fell, apart, and, on, 9,

audience, laid, the, foundation, for, modern, dutch, diplomacy, in, japan, subsequently, de, graeff, van, polsbroek, assisted, the, emperor, and, the, government, in, their, negotiations, with, representatives, of, the, major, european, powers, on, 7, april, 1868, the, emperor, was, presented, with, the, charter, oath, a, five, point, statement, of, the, nature, of, the, new, government, the, statement, was, designed, to, win, over, those, who, had, not, yet, committed, themselves, to, the, new, regime, this, document, which, the, emperor, then, formally, promoted, abolished, feudalism, and, proclaimed, a, modern, democratic, government, for, japan, the, charter, oath, would, later, be, cited, by, emperor, sh, wa, in, the, humanity, declaration, as, support, for, the,

or, enlightened, rule, heretofore, the, neng, had, often, been, changed, multiple, times, in, an, emperor, s, reign, from, now, on, it, was, announced, there, would, only, be, one, neng, per, reign, soon, after, his, coronation, the, emperor, journeyed, to, tokyo, by, road, visiting, it, for, the, first, time, he, arrived, in, late, november, and, began, an, extended, stay, by, distributing, sake, among, the, population, the, population, of, tokyo, was, eager, for, an, imperial, visit, tokyo, had, been, the, site, of, the, sh, gun, s, court, and, the, city, s, population, feared, that, with, the, abolition, of, the, shogunate, the, city, might, fall, into, decline, it, would, not, be, until, 1889, that, a, final, decision, was, made, to, move, the, capital, to, tokyo, while, in, tokyo, the, emperor, boarded, a, japanese, naval, vessel, for, the, first, time, and, the, following, day, gave, instructions, for, studies, to, see, how, japan, s, navy, could, be, strengthened, soon, after, his, return, to, kyoto, a, rescript, was, issued, in, the, emperor, s, name, but, most, likely, written, by, court, officials, it, indicated, his, intent, to, be, involved, in, government, affairs, and, indeed, he, attended, cabinet, meetings, and, innumerable, other, government, functions, though, rarely, speaking, almost, until, the, day, of, his, death, the, successful, revolutionaries, organized, themselves, into, a, council, of, state, and, subsequently, into, a, system, where, three, main, ministers, led, the, government, this, structure, would, last, until, the, establishment, of, a, prime, minister, who, would, lead, a, cabinet, in, a, western, fashion, in, 1885, initially, not, even, the, retention, of, the, emperor, was, certain, revolutionary, leader, got, sh, jir, later, stated, that, some, officials, were, afraid, the, extremists, might, go, further, and, abolish, the, mikado, japan, s, new, leaders, sought, to, reform, the, patchwork, system, of, domains, governed, by, the, daimy, s, in, 1869, several, of, the, daimy, s, who, had, supported, the, revolution, gave, their, land, property, to, the, emperor, and, were, reappointed, as, governors, with, considerable, salaries, by, the, following, year, all, other, daimy, s, had, followed, suit, in, 1871, as, japan, was, organized, into, 72, prefectures, the, emperor, announced, that, domains, were, entirely, abolished, the, daimy, s, were, compensated, with, annual, salaries, equal, to, ten, percent, of, their, former, revenues, from, which, they, now, did, not, have, to, deduct, the, cost, of, governing, but, were, required, to, move, to, the, new, capital, tokyo, most, daimy, s, retired, from, politics, the, new, administration, gradually, abolished, most, privileges, of, the, samurai, including, their, right, to, a, stipend, from, the, government, however, unlike, the, daimy, s, many, samurai, suffered, financially, from, this, change, most, other, class, based, distinctions, were, abolished, legalized, discrimination, against, the, burakumin, ended, however, these, classes, continue, to, suffer, discrimination, in, japan, to, the, present, time, the, 1889, constitution, created, a, new, parliament, although, it, had, no, real, power, power, had, passed, from, the, tokugawa, into, the, hands, of, those, daimy, s, and, other, samurai, who, had, led, the, restoration, japan, was, thus, controlled, by, the, genr, an, oligarchy, which, comprised, the, most, powerful, men, of, the, military, political, and, economic, spheres, the, emperor, showed, greater, political, longevity, than, his, recent, predecessors, as, he, was, the, first, japanese, monarch, to, remain, on, the, throne, past, the, age, of, 50, since, emperor, gimachi, s, abdication, from, the, throne, in, 1586, the, japanese, take, pride, in, the, meiji, restoration, as, it, and, the, accompanying, industrialization, allowed, japan, to, become, the, preeminent, power, in, the, pacific, and, a, major, player, in, the, world, within, a, generation, yet, emperor, meiji, s, role, in, the, restoration, as, well, as, the, amount, of, personal, authority, and, influence, he, wielded, during, his, reign, remains, debatable, he, kept, no, diary, wrote, almost, no, letters, unlike, his, father, and, left, no, more, than, three, or, four, photographs, the, accounts, of, people, who, had, met, or, were, close, to, him, usually, contain, little, substantial, information, or, are, mutually, contradictory, due, to, the, lack, of, reliable, sources, of, the, period, mysteries, surrounding, emperor, meiji, s, personality, and, role, in, the, restoration, remain, a, matter, of, historical, dispute, james, c, baxter, argues, that, the, emperor, was, a, figurehead, without, real, power, who, rarely, interfered, with, what, had, been, agreed, upon, in, advance, by, the, meiji, oligarchy, conversely, herbert, bix, describes, meiji, as, a, powerful, autocrat, whom, the, genr, struggled, to, restrain, while, accommodating, his, anti, democratic, inclinations, r, starr, characterizes, meiji, as, a, highly, individualistic, and, forthright, person, who, was, no, puppet, to, any, group, in, his, government, and, although, progressive, not, liberal, or, democratic, yet, another, group, of, historians, contend, he, was, never, a, full, dictator, but, remain, divided, on, whether, his, personal, power, was, far, closer, to, the, absolutist, end, or, he, merely, played, a, mediating, role, in, the, genr, s, decision, making, he, composed, the, following, poem, in, waka, form, this, poem, was, later, recited, by, his, grandson, emperor, sh, wa, in, an, imperial, conference, in, september, 1941, before, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, to, tell, that, he, wanted, to, avoid, the, war, the, illustrated, london, news, published, an, article, with, a, cover, illustration, of, emperor, meiji, in, the, new, york, tribune, on, 19, march, 1905, the,

most, practical, of, modern, monarchs, for, in, less, than, forty, years, he, has, brought, his, country, from, semi, barbarism, to, the, status, of, a, first, class, power, near, the, end, of, his,
