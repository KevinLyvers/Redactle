was, an, early, medieval, era, hindu, philosopher, and, scholar, of, the, advaita, vedanta, school, of, hindu, philosophy, while, details, of, his, biography, are, uncertain, his, ideas, inspired, others, such, as, adi, shankara, who, called, him, a, paramaguru, highest, teacher, gaudapada, was, the, author, or, compiler, of, the, m, kya, k, rik, also, known, as, gaudapada, karika, the, text, consists, of, four, chapters, also, called, four, books, of, which, chapter, four, uses, buddhist, terminology, thereby, showing, it, was, influenced, by, buddhism, however, doctrinally, gaudapada, s, work, is, vedantic, and, not, buddhist, the, first, three, chapters, of, gaudapada, s, text, have, been, influential, in, the, advaita, vedanta, tradition, parts, of, the, first, chapter, that, include, the, mandukya, upanishad, have, been, considered, a, valid, scriptural, source, by, the, dvaita, and, vishistadvaita, schools, of, vedanta, the, century, in, which, gaudapada, lived, and, his, life, details, are, uncertain, estimates, vary, from, early, 6th, to, 7th, century, ce, he, is, generally, dated, from, estimates, for, adi, shankara, whose, teacher, govinda, bhagavatpada, is, presumed, to, be, the, direct, disciple, of, gaudapada, shankara, in, some, texts, refers, to, gaudapada, as, the, teacher, s, teacher, who, knows, the, tradition, of, the, ved, nta, samprad, ya, vit, assuming, how, long, each, lived, and, when, gaudapada, is, estimated, to, have, lived, sometime, in, the, 7th, century, ce, alternatively, states, potter, the, phrase, teacher, s, teacher, should, not, be, taken, literally, and, more, in, the, sense, of, another, phrase, he, uses, for, gaudapada, namely, paramaguru, highest, teacher, he, may, have, been, the, guru, of, sankara, s, teacher, but, was, likely, a, more, distant, guru, states, michael, comans, aka, vasudevacharya, another, estimate, places, him, around, the, early, 6th, century, this, estimate, is, based, on, buddhist, literature, and, particularly, those, of, scholars, bhavaviveka, santaraksita, and, kamalasila, who, cite, gau, apada, k, rik, s, bhavaviveka, was, a, contemporary, of, dharmapala, states, karl, potter, while, chinese, texts, and, travel, accounts, place, dharmapala, in, the, mid, 6th, century, ce, assuming, the, buddhist, and, chinese, records, are, reliable, and, for, bhavaviveka, to, have, quoted, gau, apada, k, rik, s, gaudapada, must, have, lived, around, 500, ce, or, sometime, in, the, first, half, of, 6th, century, ce, but, it, is, certain, that, gaudapada, lived, after, the, 4th, century, because, he, cites, some, buddhist, views, of, n, g, rjuna, and, asanga, the, latter, of, whom, various, accounts, place, in, 4th, century, india, gaudapada, wrote, or, compiled, the, m, ukya, k, rik, also, known, as, the, gau, ap, da, k, rik, and, as, the, gama, stra, some, scholars, states, karl, potter, doubt, that, gaudap, da, k, rik, was, written, by, one, author, the, m, ukya, k, rik, is, a, concise, explanation, in, verse, form, of, the, doctrines, in, mandukya, upanishad, one, of, the, shortest, but, a, profound, upanishad, consisting, of, just, 12, sentences, even, before, the, time, of, adi, shankara, mandukya, upanishad, was, considered, to, be, a, ruti, but, not, one, particularly, important, during, his, era, in, later, periods, it, acquired, a, higher, value, and, expressing, the, upanishadic, essence, the, karika, notably, presents, rational, arguments, from, dream, states, infinitude, and, finitude, space, and, time, causality, disintegration, and, generation, in, support, of, the, advaita, doctrine, the, m, ukya, k, rik, is, the, earliest, extant, systematic, treatise, on, advaita, ved, nta, though, it, is, not, the, oldest, work, to, present, advaita, views, nor, the, only, pre, sankara, work, with, the, same, type, of, teachings, according, to, hajime, nakamura, not, only, was, the, gaudapada, karika, treasured, in, the, advaita, tradition, the, text, was, also, revered, and, highly, respected, in, vishistadvaita, and, dvaita, vedanta, schools, of, hinduism, gaudapada, s, text, adds, nakamura, was, treasured, but, not, considered, a, sruti, by, advaita, scholars, while, ramanuja, and, madhvacharya, of, non, advaita, schools, considered, its, first, chapter, to, be, a, sruti, the, gaudapadiya, karika, has, 215, metered, verses, which, are, divided, into, four, chapters, chronologically, according, to, hajime, nakamura, the, buddhist, texts, that, quote, from, gaudapada, karikas, imply, that, the, vedantic, ideas, in, the, first, three, chapters, are, of, greater, antiquity, most, of, chapter, three, of, the, compilation, of, gaudapada, karika, was, complete, by, 400, 500, ce, states, nakamura, he, estimates, that, most, of, chapter, one, was, complete, by, 300, 400, ce, while, chapter, two, which, presupposes, chapter, one, can, be, dated, to, have, been, mostly, complete, after, chapter, one, but, before, chapter, three, most, of, the, chapter, four, was, written, sometime, between, 400, and, 600, ce, om, is, bliss, om, is, brahman, both, the, higher, and, lower, as, well, as, ishvara,

dukkha, sorrow, this, fourth, state, of, self, in, gaudapada, karika, is, found, in, chapters, 8, 7, through, 8, 12, of, chandogya, upanishad, which, discusses, the, four, states, of, consciousness, as, awake, dream, filled, sleep, deep, sleep, and, beyond, deep, sleep, the, vishva, and, taijasa, state, of, self, states, gaudapada, can, be, a, source, of, cause, and, effect, the, prajna, is, only, cause, while, turiya, state, is, neither, it, is, the, waking, state, and, dream, state, that, lead, to, awareness, errors, and, unawareness, the, perceived, duality, of, the, world, is, maya, when, in, reality, there, is, only, nonduality, chapter, one, ends, with, the, discussion, of, the, om, and, its, symbolism, for, brahman, and, the, atman, within, the, heart, of, all, living, beings, unreal, are, the, dream, objects, during, sleep, states, gaudapada, because, the, one, who, dreams, never, actually, goes, to, the, places, he, dreams, of, and, because, whatever, situation, he, dreams, about, is, something, he, leaves, upon, waking, up, this, is, in, the, scripture, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, in, the, same, sense, the, true, reality, is, covered, up, for, man, even, in, his, waking, state, state, kaarikas, 4, 6, of, chapter, two, because, translates, potter, any, object, nonexistent, in, the, beginning, and, in, the, end, is, also, nonexistent, in, the, middle, when, we, sleep, we, feel, the, external, things, we, dream, about, are, real, and, the, internal, states, as, unreal, but, in, the, awakened, state, we, realize, both, are, unreal, in, the, same, way, in, our, waking, state, whatever, we, apprehend, to, be, real, and, unreal, are, both, unreal, covering, up, the, true, reality, state, kaarikas, 10, 15, but, this, assertion, leads, to, the, obvious, question, states, gaudapada, that, if, both, internal, and, external, are, not, true, reality, who, is, it, that, imagines, who, apprehends, them, and, who, cognizes, gaudapada, submits, his, answer, as, the, aatman, self, soul, gaudapada, kaarika, states, that, while, we, do, grasp, objects, we, perceive, we, think, but, this, does, not, connote, the, nature, of, reality, and, unreality, just, like, our, fear, of, a, rope, for, a, serpent, in, darkness, we, construct, realities, states, gaudapada, and, imagine, jivatman, to, be, various, things, such, as, praana, breath, loka, world, deva, gods, bhoktr, enjoyer, bhojya, enjoyables, sukshma, subtle, sthula, gross, murta, material, amurta, nonmaterial, and, so, on, we, imagine, things, in, our, mind, we, create, things, in, our, mind, we, destroy, things, in, our, mind, says, gaudapada, yet, all, these, things, are, not, different, from, it, the, atman, gender, neutral, all, such, constructions, create, dualities, in, our, imagination, are, maya, the, true, reality, state, kaarikas, 33, 36, is, nondual, and, it, is, atman, those, who, have, mastered, and, grown, past, all, attachments, past, all, fear, and, past, all, anger, they, are, past, all, dualities, know, their, self, have, secured, the, nonduality, within, according, to, kaarikas, 36, 38, such, wise, individuals, do, not, care, about, praise, from, anyone, are, beyond, all, rituals, are, homeless, wanderers, for, they, have, realized, the, truth, inside, them, and, outside, they, translates, potter, remain, steadfastly, true, to, nature, duties, of, worship, duties, of, worship, arise, only, for, those, who, think, something, is, born, and, who, are, thus, miserable, i, shall, therefore, speak, of, the, nonmiserable, state, in, which, gaudapada, karika, 3, 1, 2, translator, karl, potter, gaudapada, opens, this, chapter, by, criticizing, upasana, worship, and, states, that, this, assumes, that, the, brahman, atman, is, unborn, in, the, beginning, and, in, the, end, but, is, presently, born, as, jiva, he, states, that, the, nondual, brahman, atman, self, can, give, rise, to, apparent, duality, jivas, individual, souls, while, remaining, unaffected, in, the, process, to, this, end, he, gives, the, analogy, of, space, and, jars, self, is, like, space, and, the, jivas, are, like, space, in, jars, just, as, space, is, enclosed, in, a, jar, so, is, the, self, manifested, as, jivas, when, the, jar, is, destroyed, the, space, in, the, jar, merges, into, space, so, likewise, are, the, jivas, one, with, the, self, gaudapada, states, that, the, upanishads, like, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, teach, that, one, s, own, atman, self, is, identical, to, the, atman, in, other, beings, and, that, all, atman, are, identical, with, brahman, while, some, upanishads, acknowledges, gaudapada, imply, a, difference, between, individual, soul, and, the, brahman, those, texts, are, discussing, the, apparent, distinction, duality, when, one, believes, in, apparent, creation, in, reality, states, gaudapada, there, is, no, creation, of, souls, from, brahman, as, they, are, identical, we, must, not, confuse, passages, meant, for, spiritual, instruction, according, to, karikas, 3, 17, 18, gaudapada, admits, that, dualists, disagree, with, this, view, but, the, ancient, texts, admit, duality, in, the, context, of, appearances, while, nonduality, is, indeed, the, highest, reality, translates, karmarkar, according, to, karl, potter, s, translation, of, karikas, 3, 33, 36, an, awareness, that, is, without, conceptual, construction, is, unborn, and, this, awareness, is, brahman, this, awareness, is, not, a, metaphor, nor, born, it, is, real, such, awareness, shines, forth, without, fear, beyond, words, and, thought, is, calm, and, unwavering, equanimous, and, full, of, light, it, comes, from, self, reflection, understanding, giving, up, attachment, to, dukkha, frustration, and, sukha, pleasure, where, the, mind, rests, in, indescribable, calmness, within, karikas, 3, 39, 46, describe, asparsa, yoga, through, which, this, calmness, is, attained, in, this, practice, of, non, contact, a, sparsa, the, mind, is, controlled, and, brought, to, rest, and, does, not, create, things, appearances, after, which, it, grasps, it, becomes, non, dual, free, from, the, grasping, subject, object, dualism, knowing, that, only, atman, brahman, is, real, the, creations, of, the, mind, are, seen, as, false, appearances, and, negated, mk, 3, 31, 33, when, the, mind, is, brought, to, rest, it, becomes, or, is, brahman, mk, 3, 46, according, to, gaudapada, asparsa, yoga, is, difficult, for, most, including, the, yogis, who, see, fear, namely, a, loss, of, atman, in, what, is, fearlessly, blissful, the, last, chapter, of, gaudapada, karika, has, a, different, style, than, the, first, three, and, it, opens, by, expressing, reverence, for, all, the, greatest, of, men, who, are, like, the, cosmic, space, through, their, awareness, of, nonduality, free, from, self, contradictions, and, confusion, and, who, understand, dharma, karikas, 3, 10, repeat, some, content, from, previous, chapters, but, with, some, word, substitutions, karikas, 11, 13, quote, the, key, duality, premise, of, samkhya, school, of, hindu, philosophy, cross, examines, it, then, asks, how, and, why, is, cause, eternal, the, text, states, that, the, samkhya, premise, cause, is, born, as, its, effect, leads, to, infinite, regress, which, is, not, persuasive, gaudapada, karika, then, acknowledges, the, theory, of, ajativada, or, non, origination, of, the, buddhas, buddhists, like, samkhya, premise, the, text, praises, and, cross, examines, it, in, three, ways, first, non, origination, premises, makes, sense, when, neither, the, point, of, origin, nor, the, end, of, something, is, known, but, we, know, the, point, of, origin, of, any, example, of, something, produced, and, there, ajativada, premise, does, not, follow, secondly, the, ajativada, premise, commits, the, sadhyasama, fallacy, of, reasoning, by, offering, examples, of, what, is, yet, to, be, proved, thirdly, state, karikas, 29, 41, neither, samsara, nor, mukti, has, a, beginning, or, end, because, if, something, is, born, it, must, have, an, end, and, something, that, is, unborn, has, no, end, karikas, 45, 52, state, that, only, consciousness, vijnana, is, real, explaining, it, with, an, example, of, fire, stick, before, and, during, the, time, it, burns, and, adding, that, we, construct, and, deconstruct, our, state, of, awareness, karikas, 53, 56, assert, that, there, is, no, causation, no, effects, and, repeats, that, consciousness, is, the, only, real, thing, everything, is, impermanent, nothing, is, eternal, and, everything, is, also, without, origination, by, nature, state, karikas, 57, 60, karikas, 61, 81, repeat, text, on, four, states, from, earlier, chapters, to, re, emphasize, the, premises, about, impermanence, and, non, origination, attachment, to, unreality, causes, desire, sorrow, dukkha, and, fear, while, detachment, leads, to, freeing, from, such, states, and, to, samadhi, there, are, three, stages, of, understanding, state, karikas, 87, 89, laukika, ordinary, which, cognizes, object, and, subject, as, real, shuddha, laukika, purified, ordinary, where, perceiving, is, considered, real, but, not, the, objects, and, lokottara, supramundane, where, neither, objects, nor, perceiving, are, cognized, as, real, karikas, 90, 100, presents, agrayana, vehicle, to, knowing, the, text, states, all, dharmas, are, without, beginning, without, variety, and, are, consciousness, only, duality, is, for, the, unwise, nonduality, and, undifferentiated, reality, is, for, the, wise, and, difficult, to, grasp, the, last, karikas, of, the, chapter, four, add, as, translated, by, karl, potter, this, the, buddhas, understand, the, buddha, instructs, us, that, consciousness, does, not, reach, the, dharmas, yet, the, buddha, said, nothing, about, either, consciousness, or, dharmas, the, influence, of, buddhist, doctrines, on, gaudapada, has, been, a, vexed, question, though, most, recent, writers, seem, to, be, willing, to, admit, buddhist, influence, yet, also, note, that, gaudapada, was, a, vedantin, and, not, a, buddhist, gaudapada, took, over, the, yogachara, teaching, of, vij, apti, m, tra, representation, only, which, states, that, the, empirical, reality, that, we, experience, is, a, fabrication, of, the, mind, experienced, by, consciousness, an, sich, and, the, four, cornered, negation, which, negates, any, positive, predicates, of, the, absolute, gaudapada, wove, into, the, philosophy, of, mandukaya, upanisad, which, was, further, developed, by, shankara, in, this, view, the, ultimate, ontological, reality, is, the, pure, consciousness, which, is, bereft, of, attributes, and, intentionality, the, world, of, duality, is, nothing, but, a, vibration, of, the, mind, manod, ya, or, manaspandita, the, pluralistic, world, is, imagined, by, the, mind, sa, kalpa, and, this, false, projection, is, sponsored, by, the, illusory, factor, called, m, y, according, to, bhattacharya, asparsayoga, also, has, buddhist, origins, in, chapter, four, according, to, bhattacharya, two, karikas, refer, to, the, buddha, according, to, murti, the, conclusion, is, irresistible, that, gaudapada, a, vedanta, philosopher, is, attempting, an, advaitic, interpretation, of, vedanta, in, the, light, of, the, madhyamika, and, yogcara, doctrines, he, even, freely, quotes, and, appeals, to, them, however, adds, murti, the, doctrines, are, unlike, buddhism, chapter, one, two, and, three, are, entirely, vedantin, and, founded, on, the, upanishads, with, little, buddhist, flavour, while, the, first, three, chapters, discuss, brahman, and, atman, soul, self, chapter, four, doesn, t, this, according, to, murti, may, be, because, this, was, authored, by, someone, else, and, not, gaudapada, a, position, shared, by, richard, king, further, state, both, murti, and, king, no, vedanta, scholars, who, followed, gaudapada, ever, quoted, from, chapter, four, they, only, quote, from, the, first, three, according, to, sarma, chapter, four, may, well, have, been, written, by, gaudapada, assuming, he, was, fully, conversant, with, mahayana, school, s, teachings, yet, to, mistake, him, to, be, a, hidden, or, open, buddhist, is, absurd, the, doctrines, of, gaudapada, and, buddhism, are, totally, opposed, states, murti, we, have, been, talking, of, borrowing, influence, and, relationship, in, rather, general, terms, it, is, necessary, to, define, the, possible, nature, of, the, borrowing, granting, that, it, did, take, place, the, vedantins, stake, everything, on, the, atman, brahman, and, accept, the, authority, of, the, upanishads, we, have, pointed, out, at, length, the, nairatmya, standpoint, of, buddhism, and, its, total, opposition, to, the, atman, soul, substance, the, permanent, and, universal, in, any, form, sengaku, mayeda, states, that, it, might, be, gaudapada, the, author, of, the, mandukyakarika, or, his, predecessors, and, not, shankara, who, can, be, called, a, buddhist, in, disguise, and, credits, shankara, with, re, inject, the, upanishadic, spirit, into, the, extremely, buddhisticized, mandukyakarika, of, his, paramaguru, pouring, new, life, into, it, as, it, were, giving, it, an, interpretation, that, followed, the, line, of, vedanta, school, and, achieved, the, re, vedantinization, of, the, buddhisticized, vedantic, tradition, swami, nikhilananda, denies, buddhist, influence, arguing, that, gaudapada, used, buddhist, terminology, because, buddhism, was, prevalent, at, that, time, but, he, was, ultimately, an, advaita, vedantin, and, he, disagrees, with, gautama, buddha, in, the, second, last, verse, of, the, alatashanti, prakarana, in, the, k, rik, dasgupta, explicitly, states, that, nikhilanda, is, incorrect, in, denying, buddhist, influence, stating, in, sangharakshita, s, words, that, the, influence, of, buddhism, on, his, thinking, could, not, be, denied, a, number, of, additional, works, are, attributed, to, gaudapada, but, their, authenticity, is, uncertain, the, attributed, works, are, gaudapada, is, also, credited, with, a, commentary, on, samkhyakarikas, according, to, potter, the, naive, nature, of, this, commentary, is, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, depth, of, reflection, in, gaudapada, karikas, and, it, is, unlikely, that, the, commentary, on, the, samkhyakarikas, was, written, by, gaudapada, gaudapada, is, one, of, the, key, persons, in, the, advaita, vedanta, he, is, traditionally, said, to, have, been, highly, influential, on, adi, shankara, one, of, the, most, important,
