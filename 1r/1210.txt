courant, s, readers, were, aware, of, the, ruse, and, james, was, unhappy, with, benjamin, when, he, discovered, the, popular, correspondent, was, his, younger, brother, franklin, was, an, advocate, of, free, speech, from, an, early, age, when, his, brother, was, jailed, for, three, weeks, in, 1722, for, publishing, material, unflattering, to, the, governor, young, franklin, took, over, the, newspaper, and, had, mrs, dogood, proclaim, quoting, cato, s, letters, without, freedom, of, thought, there, can, be, no, such, thing, as, wisdom, and, no, such, thing, as, public, liberty, without, freedom, of, speech, franklin, left, his, apprenticeship, without, his, brother, s, permission, and, in, so, doing, became, a, fugitive, at, age, 17, franklin, ran, away, to, philadelphia, seeking, a, new, start, in, a, new, city, when, he, first, arrived, he, worked, in, several, printing, shops, there, but, he, was, not, satisfied, by, the, immediate, prospects, in, any, of, these, jobs, after, a, few, months, while, working, in, one, printing, house, pennsylvania, governor, sir, william, keith, convinced, him, to, go, to, london, ostensibly, to, acquire, the, equipment, necessary, for, establishing, another, newspaper, in, philadelphia, discovering, that, keith, s, promises, of, backing, a, newspaper, were, empty, he, worked, as, a, typesetter, in, a, printer, s, shop, in, what, is, the, present, day, church, of, st, bartholomew, the, great, in, the, smithfield, area, of, london, following, this, he, returned, to, philadelphia, in, 1726, with, the, help, of, thomas, denham, a, merchant, who, employed, him, as, a, clerk, shopkeeper, and, bookkeeper, in, his, business, in, 1727, at, age, 21, franklin, formed, the, junto, a, group, of, like, minded, aspiring, artisans, and, tradesmen, who, hoped, to, improve, themselves, while, they, improved, their, community, the, junto, was, a, discussion, group, for, issues, of, the, day, it, subsequently, gave, rise, to, many, organizations, in, philadelphia, the, junto, was, modeled, after, english, coffeehouses, that, franklin, knew, well, and, which, had, become, the, center, of, the, spread, of, enlightenment, ideas, in, britain, reading, was, a, great, pastime, of, the, junto, but, books, were, rare, and, expensive, the, members, created, a, library, initially, assembled, from, their, own, books, after, franklin, wrote, a, proposition, was, made, by, me, that, since, our, books, were, often, referr, d, to, in, our, disquisitions, upon, the, inquiries, it, might, be, convenient, for, us, to, have, them, altogether, where, we, met, that, upon, occasion, they, might, be, consulted, and, by, thus, clubbing, our, books, to, a, common, library, we, should, while, we, lik, d, to, keep, them, together, have, each, of, us, the, advantage, of, using, the, books, of, all, the, other, members, which, would, be, nearly, as, beneficial, as, if, each, owned, the, whole, this, did, not, suffice, however, franklin, conceived, the, idea, of, a, subscription, library, which, would, pool, the, funds, of, the, members, to, buy, books, for, all, to, read, this, was, the, birth, of, the, library, company, of, philadelphia, whose, charter, he, composed, in, 1731, upon, denham, s, death, franklin, returned, to, his, former, trade, in, 1728, he, set, up, a, printing, house, in, partnership, with, hugh, meredith, the, following, year, he, became, the, publisher, of, the, pennsylvania, gazette, a, newspaper, in, philadelphia, the, gazette, gave, franklin, a, forum, for, agitation, about, a, variety, of, local, reforms, and, initiatives, through, printed, essays, and, observations, over, time, his, commentary, and, his, adroit, cultivation, of, a, positive, image, as, an, industrious, and, intellectual, young, man, earned, him, a, great, deal, of, social, respect, but, even, after, he, achieved, fame, as, a, scientist, and, statesman, he, habitually, signed, his, letters, with, the, unpretentious, b, franklin, printer, in, 1732, he, published, the, first, german, language, newspaper, in, america, die, philadelphische, zeitung, although, it, failed, after, only, one, year, because, four, other, newly, founded, german, papers, quickly, dominated, the, newspaper, market, franklin, also, printed, moravian, religious, books, in, german, he, often, visited, bethlehem, pennsylvania, staying, at, the, moravian, sun, inn, in, a, 1751, pamphlet, on, demographic, growth, and, its, implications, for, the, thirteen, colonies, he, called, the, pennsylvania, germans, palatine, boors, who, could, never, acquire, the, complexion, of, anglo, american, settlers, and, referred, to, blacks, and, tawneys, as, weakening, the, social, structure, of, the, colonies, although, he, apparently, reconsidered, shortly, thereafter, and, the, phrases, were, omitted, from, all, later, printings, of, the, pamphlet, his, views, may, have, played, a, role, in, his, political, defeat, in, 1764, according, to, ralph, frasca, franklin, promoted, the, printing, press, as, a, device, to, instruct, colonial, americans, in, moral, virtue, frasca, argues, he, saw, this, as, a, service, to, god, because, he, understood, moral, virtue, in, terms, of, actions, thus, doing, good, provides, a, service, to, god, despite, his, own, moral, lapses, franklin, saw, himself, as, uniquely, qualified, to, instruct, americans, in, morality, he, tried, to, influence, american, moral, life, through, the, construction, of, a, printing, network, based, on, a, chain, of, partnerships, from, the, carolinas, to, new, england, he, thereby, invented, the, first, newspaper, chain, it, was, more, than, a, business, venture, for, like, many, publishers, he, believed, that, the, press, had, a, public, service, duty, when, he, established, himself, in, philadelphia, shortly, before, 1730, the, town, boasted, two, wretched, little, news, sheets, andrew, bradford, s, the, american, weekly, mercury, and, samuel, keimer, s, universal, instructor, in, all, arts, and, sciences, and, pennsylvania, gazette, this, instruction, in, all, arts, and, sciences, consisted, of, weekly, extracts, from, chambers, s, universal, dictionary, franklin, quickly, did, away, with, all, of, this, when, he, took, over, the, instructor, and, made, it, the, pennsylvania, gazette, the, gazette, soon, became, his, characteristic, organ, which, he, freely, used, for, satire, for, the, play, of, his, wit, even, for, sheer, excess, of, mischief, or, of, fun, from, the, first, he, had, a, way, of, adapting, his, models, to, his, own, uses, the, series, of, essays, called, the, busy, body, which, he, wrote, for, bradford, s, american, mercury, in, 1729, followed, the, general, addisonian, form, already, modified, to, suit, homelier, conditions, the, thrifty, patience, in, her, busy, little, shop, complaining, of, the, useless, visitors, who, waste, her, valuable, time, is, related, to, the, women, who, address, mr, spectator, the, busy, body, himself, is, a, true, censor, morum, as, isaac, bickerstaff, had, been, in, the, tatler, and, a, number, of, the, fictitious, characters, ridentius, eugenius, cato, and, cretico, represent, traditional, 18th, century, classicism, even, this, franklin, could, use, for, contemporary, satire, since, cretico, the, sowre, philosopher, is, evidently, a, portrait, of, his, rival, samuel, keimer, franklin, had, mixed, success, in, his, plan, to, establish, an, inter, colonial, network, of, newspapers, that, would, produce, a, profit, for, him, and, disseminate, virtue, over, the, years, he, sponsored, two, dozen, printers, in, pennsylvania, south, carolina, new, york, connecticut, and, even, the, caribbean, by, 1753, eight, of, the, fifteen, english, language, newspapers, in, the, colonies, were, published, by, him, or, his, partners, he, began, in, charleston, south, carolina, in, 1731, after, his, second, editor, died, the, widow, elizabeth, timothy, took, over, and, made, it, a, success, she, was, one, of, the, colonial, era, s, first, woman, printers, for, three, decades, franklin, maintained, a, close, business, relationship, with, her, and, her, son, peter, timothy, who, took, over, the, south, carolina, gazette, in, 1746, the, gazette, was, impartial, in, political, debates, while, creating, the, opportunity, for, public, debate, which, encouraged, others, to, challenge, authority, timothy, avoided, blandness, and, crude, bias, and, after, 1765, increasingly, took, a, patriotic, stand, in, the, growing, crisis, with, great, britain, franklin, s, connecticut, gazette, 1755, 68, however, proved, unsuccessful, as, the, revolution, approached, political, strife, slowly, tore, his, network, apart, in, 1730, or, 1731, franklin, was, initiated, into, the, local, masonic, lodge, he, became, a, grand, master, in, 1734, indicating, his, rapid, rise, to, prominence, in, pennsylvania, the, same, year, he, edited, and, published, the, first, masonic, book, in, the, americas, a, reprint, of, james, anderson, s, constitutions, of, the, free, masons, he, was, the, secretary, of, st, john, s, lodge, in, philadelphia, from, 1735, to, 1738, in, january, 1738, franklin, appeared, as, a, witness, in, a, manslaughter, trial, against, two, men, who, killed, a, simple, minded, apprentice, named, daniel, rees, in, a, fake, masonic, initiation, gone, wrong, one, of, the, men, threw, or, accidentally, spilled, the, burning, spirits, and, daniel, rees, died, of, his, burns, two, days, later, while, franklin, did, not, directly, participate, in, the, hazing, that, led, to, rees, death, he, knew, of, the, hazing, before, it, turned, fatal, and, did, nothing, to, stop, it, he, was, criticized, for, his, inaction, in, the, american, weekly, mercury, by, his, publishing, rival, andrew, bradford, ultimately, franklin, replied, in, his, own, defense, in, the, gazette, franklin, remained, a, freemason, for, the, rest, of, his, life, at, age, 17, in, 1723, franklin, proposed, to, 15, year, old, deborah, read, while, a, boarder, in, the, read, home, at, that, time, deborah, s, mother, was, wary, of, allowing, her, young, daughter, to, marry, franklin, who, was, on, his, way, to, london, at, governor, keith, s, request, and, also, because, of, his, financial, instability, her, own, husband, had, recently, died, and, she, declined, franklin, s, request, to, marry, her, daughter, franklin, travelled, to, london, and, after, he, failed, to, communicate, as, expected, with, deborah, and, her, family, they, interpreted, his, long, silence, as, a, breaking, of, his, promises, at, the, urging, of, her, mother, deborah, married, a, potter, named, john, rogers, on, august, 5, 1725, john, soon, fled, to, barbados, with, her, dowry, in, order, to, avoid, debts, and, prosecution, since, rogers, fate, was, unknown, bigamy, laws, prevented, deborah, from, remarrying, franklin, returned, in, 1726, and, resumed, his, courtship, of, deborah, they, established, a, common, law, marriage, on, september, 1, 1730, they, took, in, his, recently, acknowledged, illegitimate, young, son, and, raised, him, in, their, household, they, had, two, children, together, their, son, francis, folger, franklin, was, born, in, october, 1732, and, died, of, smallpox, in, 1736, their, daughter, sarah, sally, franklin, was, born, in, 1743, and, eventually, married, richard, bache, deborah, s, fear, of, the, sea, meant, that, she, never, accompanied, franklin, on, any, of, his, extended, trips, to, europe, another, possible, reason, why, they, spent, much, time, apart, is, that, he, may, have, blamed, her, for, possibly, preventing, their, son, francis, from, being, inoculated, against, the, disease, that, subsequently, killed, him, deborah, wrote, to, him, in, november, 1769, saying, she, was, ill, due, to, dissatisfied, distress, from, his, prolonged, absence, but, he, did, not, return, until, his, business, was, done, deborah, read, franklin, died, of, a, stroke, on, december, 14, 1774, while, franklin, was, on, an, extended, mission, to, great, britain, he, returned, in, 1775, in, 1730, 24, year, old, franklin, publicly, acknowledged, his, illegitimate, son, william, and, raised, him, in, his, household, william, was, born, on, february, 22, 1730, but, his, mother, s, identity, is, unknown, he, was, educated, in, philadelphia, and, beginning, at, about, age, 30, studied, law, in, london, in, the, early, 1760s, william, himself, fathered, an, illegitimate, son, william, temple, franklin, born, on, the, same, day, and, month, february, 22, 1760, the, boy, s, mother, was, never, identified, and, he, was, placed, in, foster, care, in, 1762, the, elder, william, franklin, married, elizabeth, downes, daughter, of, a, planter, from, barbados, in, london, in, 1763, he, was, appointed, as, the, last, royal, governor, of, new, jersey, a, loyalist, to, the, king, william, franklin, saw, his, relations, with, father, benjamin, eventually, break, down, over, their, differences, about, the, american, revolutionary, war, as, benjamin, franklin, could, never, accept, william, s, position, deposed, in, 1776, by, the, revolutionary, government, of, new, jersey, william, was, placed, under, house, arrest, at, his, home, in, perth, amboy, for, six, months, after, the, declaration, of, independence, he, was, formally, taken, into, custody, by, order, of, the, provincial, congress, of, new, jersey, an, entity, which, he, refused, to, recognize, regarding, it, as, an, illegal, assembly, he, was, incarcerated, in, connecticut, for, two, years, in, wallingford, and, middletown, and, after, being, caught, surreptitiously, engaging, americans, into, supporting, the, loyalist, cause, was, held, in, solitary, confinement, at, litchfield, for, eight, months, when, finally, released, in, a, prisoner, exchange, in, 1778, he, moved, to, new, york, city, which, was, occupied, by, the, british, at, the, time, while, in, new, york, city, he, became, leader, of, the, board, of, associated, loyalists, a, quasi, military, organization, chartered, by, king, george, iii, and, headquartered, in, new, york, city, they, initiated, guerrilla, forays, into, new, jersey, southern, connecticut, and, new, york, counties, north, of, the, city, when, british, troops, evacuated, from, new, york, william, franklin, left, with, them, and, sailed, to, england, he, settled, in, london, never, to, return, to, north, america, in, the, preliminary, peace, talks, in, 1782, with, britain, benjamin, franklin, insisted, that, loyalists, who, had, borne, arms, against, the, united, states, would, be, excluded, from, this, plea, that, they, be, given, a, general, pardon, he, was, undoubtedly, thinking, of, william, franklin, in, 1732, franklin, began, to, publish, the, noted, poor, richard, s, almanack, with, content, both, original, and, borrowed, under, the, pseudonym, richard, saunders, on, which, much, of, his, popular, reputation, is, based, he, frequently, wrote, under, pseudonyms, the, first, issue, published, was, for, the, upcoming, year, 1733, he, had, developed, a, distinct, signature, style, that, was, plain, pragmatic, and, had, a, sly, soft, but, self, deprecating, tone, with, declarative, sentences, although, it, was, no, secret, that, he, was, the, author, his, richard, saunders, character, repeatedly, denied, it, poor, richard, s, proverbs, adages, from, this, almanac, such, as, a, penny, saved, is, twopence, dear, often, misquoted, as, a, penny, saved, is, a, penny, earned, and, fish, and, visitors, stink, in, three, days, remain, common, quotations, in, the, modern, world, wisdom, in, folk, society, meant, the, ability, to, provide, an, apt, adage, for, any, occasion, and, his, readers, became, well, prepared, he, sold, about, ten, thousand, copies, per, year, it, became, an, institution, in, 1741, franklin, began, publishing, the, general, magazine, and, historical, chronicle, for, all, the, british, plantations, in, america, he, used, the,

advice, to, a, young, man, about, channeling, sexual, urges, due, to, its, licentious, nature, it, was, not, published, in, collections, of, his, papers, during, the, 19th, century, federal, court,

causing, excessive, inflation, in, 1766, he, made, a, case, for, paper, money, to, the, british, house, of, commons, as, he, matured, franklin, began, to, concern, himself, more, with, public,

royal, government, was, a, rare, political, miscalculation, however, pennsylvanians, worried, that, such, a, move, would, endanger, their, political, and, religious, freedoms, because, of, these, fears, and, because, of, political, attacks, on, his, character, franklin, lost, his, seat, in, the, october, 1764, assembly, elections, the, anti, proprietary, party, dispatched, him, to, england,

he, called, the, honest, whigs, which, held, stated, meetings, and, included, members, such, as, richard, price, the, minister, of, newington, green, unitarian, church, who, ignited, the, revolution,

london, in, 1768, he, developed, a, phonetic, alphabet, in, a, scheme, for, a, new, alphabet, and, a, reformed, mode, of, spelling, this, reformed, alphabet, discarded, six, letters, he, regarded, as, redundant, c, j, q, w, x, and, y, and, substituted, six, new, letters, for, sounds, he, felt, lacked, letters, of, their, own, this, alphabet, never, caught, on, and, he, eventually, lost, interest, franklin, used, london, as, a, base, to, travel, in, 1771, he, made, short, journeys, through, different, parts, of, england, staying, with, joseph, priestley, at, leeds, thomas, percival, at,

in, ireland, he, stayed, with, lord, hillsborough, franklin, noted, of, him, that, all, the, plausible, behaviour, i, have, described, is, meant, only, by, patting, and, stroking, the, horse, to, make, him, more, patient, while, the, reins, are, drawn, tighter, and, the, spurs, set, deeper, into, his, sides, in, dublin, franklin, was, invited, to, sit, with, the, members, of, the, irish, parliament, rather, than, in, the, gallery, he, was, the, first, american, to, receive, this, honor, while, touring, ireland, he, was, deeply, moved, by, the, level, of, poverty, he, witnessed, the, economy, of, the, kingdom, of, ireland, was, affected, by, the, same, trade, regulations, and, laws, that, governed, the, thirteen, colonies, he, feared, that, the, american, colonies, could, eventually, come, to, the, same, level, of, poverty, if, the, regulations, and, laws, continued, to, apply, to, them, franklin, spent, two, months, in, german, lands, in, 1766, but, his, connections, to, the, country, stretched, across, a, lifetime, he, declared, a, debt, of, gratitude, to, german, scientist, otto, von, guericke, for, his, early, studies, of, electricity, franklin, also, co,

news, of, his, electrical, discoveries, was, widespread, in, france, his, reputation, meant, that, he, was, introduced, to, many, influential, scientists, and, politicians, and, also, to, king, louis, xv, one, line, of, argument, in, parliament, was, that, americans, should, pay, a, share, of, the, costs, of, the, french, and, indian, war, and, therefore, taxes, should, be, levied, on, them, franklin, became, the, american, spokesman, in, highly, publicized, testimony, in, parliament, in, 1766, he, stated, that, americans, already, contributed, heavily, to, the, defense, of, the, empire, he, said, local, governments, had, raised, outfitted, and, paid, 25, 000, soldiers, to, fight, france, as, many, as, britain, itself, sent, and, spent, many, millions, from, american, treasuries,

franklin, is, known, to, have, occasionally, attended, the, hellfire, club, s, meetings, during, 1758, as, a, non, member, during, his, time, in, england, however, some, authors, and, historians, would, argue, he, was, in, fact, a, british, spy, as, there, are, no, records, left, having, been, burned, in, 1774, many, of, these, members, are, just, assumed, or, linked, by, letters, sent, to, each, other, one, early, proponent, that, franklin, was, a, member, of, the, hellfire, club, and, a, double, agent, is, the, historian, donald, mccormick, who, has, a, history, of, making, controversial, claims, in, 1763, soon, after, franklin, returned, to, pennsylvania, from, england, for, the, first, time, the, western, frontier, was, engulfed, in, a, bitter, war, known, as, pontiac,

leaders, and, persuaded, them, to, disperse, franklin, wrote, a, scathing, attack, against, the, racial, prejudice, of, the, paxton, boys, if, an, indian, injures, me, he, asked, does, it, follow, that, i, may, revenge, that, injury, on, all, indians, he, provided, an, early, response, to, british, surveillance, through, his, own, network, of, counter, surveillance, and, manipulation, he, waged, a, public, relations, campaign, secured, secret, aid, played, a, role, in, privateering, expeditions, and, churned, out, effective, and, inflammatory, propaganda, by, the, time, franklin,

wrought, he, replied, a, republic, madam, if, you, can, keep, it, franklin, suffered, from, obesity, throughout, his, middle, age, and, elder, years, which, resulted, in, multiple, health, problems, particularly, gout, which, worsened, as, he, aged, in, poor, health, during, the, signing, of, the, u, s, constitution, in, 1787, he, was, rarely, seen, in, public, from, then, until, his, death, franklin, died, from, pleuritic, attack, at, his, home, in, philadelphia, on, april, 17, 1790, he, was, aged, 84, at, the, time, of, his, death, his, last, words, were, reportedly, a, dying, man, can, do, nothing, easy, to, his, daughter, after, she, suggested, that, he, change, position, in, bed, and, lie, on, his, side, so, he, could, breathe, more, easily, franklin, s, death, is, described, in, the, book, the, life, of, benjamin, franklin, quoting, from, the, account, of, john, paul, jones, when, the, pain, and, difficulty, of, breathing, entirely, left, him, and, his, family, were, flattering, themselves, with, the, hopes, of, his, recovery, when, an, imposthume, which, had, formed, itself, in, his, lungs, suddenly, burst, and, discharged, a, quantity, of, matter, which, he, continued, to, throw, up, while, he, had, power, but, as, that, failed, the, organs, of, respiration, became, gradually, oppressed, a, calm, lethargic, state, succeeded, and, on, the, 17th, instant, april, 1790, about, eleven, o, clock, at, night, he, quietly, expired, closing, a, long, and, useful, life, of, eighty, four, years, and, three, months, approximately, 20, 000, people, attended, franklin, s, funeral, after, which, he, was, interred, in, christ, church, burial, ground, in, philadelphia, upon, learning, of, his, death, the, constitutional, assembly, in, revolutionary, france, entered, into, a, state, of, mourning, for, a, period, of, three, days, and, memorial, services, were, conducted, in, honor, of, franklin, throughout, the, country, in, 1728, aged, 22, franklin, wrote, what, he, hoped, would, be, his, own, epitaph, the, body, of, b, franklin, printer, like, the, cover, of, an, old, book, its, contents, torn, out, and, stript, of, its, lettering, and, gilding, lies, here, food, for, worms, but, the, work, shall, not, be, wholly, lost, for, it, will, as, he, believ, d, appear, once, more, in, a, new, more, perfect, edition, corrected, and, amended, by, the, author, franklin, s, actual, grave, however, as, he, specified, in, his, final, will, simply, reads, benjamin, and, deborah, franklin, franklin, was, a, prodigious, inventor, among, his, many, creations, were, the, lightning, rod, franklin, stove, bifocal, glasses, and, the, flexible, urinary, catheter, he, never, patented, his, inventions, in, his, autobiography, he, wrote, as, we, enjoy, great, advantages, from, the, inventions, of, others, we, should, be, glad, of, an, opportunity, to, serve, others, by, any, invention, of, ours, and, this, we, should, do, freely, and, generously, franklin, started, exploring, the, phenomenon, of, electricity, in, the, 1740s, after, he, met, the, itinerant, lecturer, archibald, spencer, who, used, static, electricity, in, his, demonstrations, he, proposed, that, vitreous, and, resinous, electricity, were, not, different, types, of, electrical, fluid, as, electricity, was, called, then, but, the, same, fluid, under, different, pressures, the, same, proposal, was, made, independently, that, same, year, by, william, watson, he, was, the, first, to, label, them, as, positive, and, negative, respectively, which, replaced, the, then, current, distinction, made, between, vitreous, and, resinous, electricity, and, he, was, the, first, to, discover, the, principle, of, conservation, of, charge, in, 1748, he, constructed, a, multiple, plate, capacitor, that, he, called, an, electrical, battery, not, a, true, battery, like, volta, s, pile, by, placing, eleven, panes, of, glass, sandwiched, between, lead, plates, suspended, with, silk, cords, and, connected, by, wires, in, pursuit, of, more, pragmatic, uses, for, electricity, remarking, in, spring, 1749, that, he, felt, chagrin, d, a, little, that, his, experiments, had, heretofore, resulted, in, nothing, in, this, way, of, use, to, mankind, franlkin, planned, a, practical, demonstration, he, proposed, a, dinner, party, where, a, turkey, was, to, be, killed, via, electric, shock, and, roasted, on, an, electrical, spit, after, having, prepared, several, turkeys, this, way, he, noted, that, the, birds, kill, d, in, this, manner, eat, uncommonly, tender, franklin, recounted, that, in, the, process, of, one, of, these, experiments, he, was, shocked, by, a, pair, of, leyden, jars, resulting, in, numbness, in, his, arms, that, persisted, for, one, evening, noting, i, am, ashamed, to, have, been, guilty, of, so, notorious, a, blunder, franklin, briefly, investigated, electrotherapy, including, the, use, of, the, electric, bath, this, work, led, to, the, field, becoming, widely, known, in, recognition, of, his, work, with, electricity, he, received, the, royal, society, s, copley, medal, in, 1753, and, in, 1756, he, became, one, of, the, few, 18th, century, americans, elected, a, fellow, of, the, society, the, cgs, unit, of, electric, charge, has, been, named, after, him, one, franklin, fr, is, equal, to, one, statcoulomb, franklin, advised, harvard, university, in, its, acquisition, of, new, electrical, laboratory, apparatus, after, the, complete, loss, of, its, original, collection, in, a, fire, that, destroyed, the, original, harvard, hall, in, 1764, the, collection, he, assembled, later, became, part, of, the, harvard, collection, of, historical, scientific, instruments, now, on, public, display, in, its, science, center, franklin, published, a, proposal, for, an, experiment, to, prove, that, lightning, is, electricity, by, flying, a, kite, in, a, storm, on, may, 10, 1752, thomas, fran, ois, dalibard, of, france, conducted, franklin, s, experiment, using, a, 40, foot, tall, 12, m, iron, rod, instead, of, a, kite, and, he, extracted, electrical, sparks, from, a, cloud, on, june, 15, 1752, franklin, may, possibly, have, conducted, his, well, known, kite, experiment, in, philadelphia, successfully, extracting, sparks, from, a, cloud, he, described, the, experiment, in, his, newspaper, the, pennsylvania, gazette, on, october, 19, 1752, without, mentioning, that, he, himself, had, performed, it, this, account, was, read, to, the, royal, society, on, december, 21, and, printed, as, such, in, the, philosophical, transactions, joseph, priestley, published, an, account, with, additional, details, in, his, 1767, history, and, present, status, of, electricity, franklin, was, careful, to, stand, on, an, insulator, keeping, dry, under, a, roof, to, avoid, the, danger, of, electric, shock, others, such, as, georg, wilhelm, richmann, in, russia, were, indeed, electrocuted, in, performing, lightning, experiments, during, the, months, immediately, following, his, experiment, in, his, writings, franklin, indicates, that, he, was, aware, of, the, dangers, and, offered, alternative, ways, to, demonstrate, that, lightning, was, electrical, as, shown, by, his, use, of, the, concept, of, electrical, ground, he, did, not, perform, this, experiment, in, the, way, that, is, often, pictured, in, popular, literature, flying, the, kite, and, waiting, to, be, struck, by, lightning, as, it, would, have, been, dangerous, instead, he, used, the, kite, to, collect, some, electric, charge, from, a, storm, cloud, showing, that, lightning, was, electrical, on, october, 19, 1752, in, a, letter, to, england, with, directions, for, repeating, the, experiment, he, wrote, when, rain, has, wet, the, kite, twine, so, that, it, can, conduct, the, electric, fire, freely, you, will, find, it, streams, out, plentifully, from, the, key, at, the, approach, of, your, knuckle, and, with, this, key, a, phial, or, leyden, jar, may, be, charged, and, from, electric, fire, thus, obtained, spirits, may, be, kindled, and, all, other, electric, experiments, performed, which, are, usually, done, by, the, help, of, a, rubber, glass, globe, or, tube, and, therefore, the, sameness, of, the, electrical, matter, with, that, of, lightening, completely, demonstrated, franklin, s, electrical, experiments, led, to, his, invention, of, the, lightning, rod, he, said, that, conductors, with, a, sharp, rather, than, a, smooth, point, could, discharge, silently, and, at, a, far, greater, distance, he, surmised, that, this, could, help, protect, buildings, from, lightning, by, attaching, upright, rods, of, iron, made, sharp, as, a, needle, and, gilt, to, prevent, rusting, and, from, the, foot, of, those, rods, a, wire, down, the, outside, of, the, building, into, the, ground, would, not, these, pointed, rods, probably, draw, the, electrical, fire, silently, out, of, a, cloud, before, it, came, nigh, enough, to, strike, and, thereby, secure, us, from, that, most, sudden, and, terrible, mischief, following, a, series, of, experiments, on, franklin, s, own, house, lightning, rods, were, installed, on, the, academy, of, philadelphia, later, the, university, of, pennsylvania, and, the, pennsylvania, state, house, later, independence, hall, in, 1752, franklin, had, a, major, influence, on, the, emerging, science, of, demography, or, population, studies, in, the, 1730s, and, 1740s, he, began, taking, notes, on, population, growth, finding, that, the, american, population, had, the, fastest, growth, rate, on, earth, emphasizing, that, population, growth, depended, on, food, supplies, he, emphasized, the, abundance, of, food, and, available, farmland, in, america, he, calculated, that, america, s, population, was, doubling, every, 20, years, and, would, surpass, that, of, england, in, a, century, in, 1751, he, drafted, observations, concerning, the, increase, of, mankind, peopling, of, countries, etc, four, years, later, it, was, anonymously, printed, in, boston, and, was, quickly, reproduced, in, britain, where, it, influenced, the, economist, adam, smith, and, later, the, demographer, thomas, malthus, who, credited, franklin, for, discovering, a, rule, of, population, growth, franklin, s, predictions, on, how, british, mercantilism, was, unsustainable, alarmed, british, leaders, who, did, not, want, to, be, surpassed, by, the, colonies, so, they, became, more, willing, to, impose, restrictions, on, the, colonial, economy, kammen, 1990, and, drake, 2011, say, franklin, s, observations, concerning, the, increase, of, mankind, 1755, stands, alongside, ezra, stiles, discourse, on, christian, union, 1760, as, the, leading, works, of, 18th, century, anglo, american, demography, drake, credits, franklin, s, wide, readership, and, prophetic, insight, franklin, was, also, a, pioneer, in, the, study, of, slave, demography, as, shown, in, his, 1755, essay, in, his, capacity, as, a, farmer, he, wrote, at, least, one, critique, about, the, negative, consequences, of, price, controls, trade, restrictions, and, subsidy, of, the, poor, this, is, succinctly, preserved, in, his, letter, to, the, london, chronicle, published, november, 29, 1766, titled, on, the, price, of, corn, and, management, of, the, poor, as, deputy, postmaster, franklin, became, interested, in, north, atlantic, ocean, circulation, patterns, while, in, england, in, 1768, he, heard, a, complaint, from, the, colonial, board, of, customs, british, packet, ships, carrying, mail, had, taken, several, weeks, longer, to, reach, new, york, than, it, took, an, average, merchant, ship, to, reach, newport, rhode, island, the, merchantmen, had, a, longer, and, more, complex, voyage, because, they, left, from, london, while, the, packets, left, from, falmouth, in, cornwall, franklin, put, the, question, to, his, cousin, timothy, folger, a, nantucket, whaler, captain, who, told, him, that, merchant, ships, routinely, avoided, a, strong, eastbound, mid, ocean, current, the, mail, packet, captains, sailed, dead, into, it, thus, fighting, an, adverse, current, of, 3, miles, per, hour, 5, km, h, franklin, worked, with, folger, and, other, experienced, ship, captains, learning, enough, to, chart, the, current, and, name, it, the, gulf, stream, by, which, it, is, still, known, today, franklin, published, his, gulf, stream, chart, in, 1770, in, england, where, it, was, ignored, subsequent, versions, were, printed, in, france, in, 1778, and, the, u, s, in, 1786, the, british, original, edition, of, the, chart, had, been, so, thoroughly, ignored, that, everyone, assumed, it, was, lost, forever, until, phil, richardson, a, woods, hole, oceanographer, and, gulf, stream, expert, discovered, it, in, the, biblioth, que, nationale, in, paris, in, 1980, this, find, received, front, page, coverage, in, the, new, york, times, it, took, many, years, for, british, sea, captains, to, adopt, franklin, s, advice, on, navigating, the, current, once, they, did, they, were, able, to, trim, two, weeks, from, their, sailing, time, in, 1853, the, oceanographer, and, cartographer, matthew, fontaine, maury, noted, that, while, franklin, charted, and, codified, the, gulf, stream, he, did, not, discover, it, though, it, was, dr, franklin, and, captain, tim, folger, who, first, turned, the, gulf, stream, to, nautical, account, the, discovery, that, there, was, a, gulf, stream, cannot, be, said, to, belong, to, either, of, them, for, its, existence, was, known, to, peter, martyr, d, anghiera, and, to, sir, humphrey, gilbert, in, the, 16th, century, an, aging, franklin, accumulated, all, his, oceanographic, findings, in, maritime, observations, published, by, the, philosophical, society, s, transactions, in, 1786, it, contained, ideas, for, sea, anchors, catamaran, hulls, watertight, compartments, shipboard, lightning, rods, and, a, soup, bowl, designed, to, stay, stable, in, stormy, weather, franklin, was, along, with, his, contemporary, leonhard, euler, the, only, major, scientist, who, supported, christiaan, huygens, s, wave, theory, of, light, which, was, basically, ignored, by, the, rest, of, the, scientific, community, in, the, 18th, century, isaac, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, was, held, to, be, true, it, took, thomas, young, s, well, known, slit, experiment, in, 1803, to, persuade, most, scientists, to, believe, huygens, s, theory, on, october, 21, 1743, according, to, the, popular, myth, a, storm, moving, from, the, southwest, denied, franklin, the, opportunity, of, witnessing, a, lunar, eclipse, he, was, said, to, have, noted, that, the, prevailing, winds, were, actually, from, the, northeast, contrary, to, what, he, had, expected, in, correspondence, with, his, brother, he, learned, that, the, same, storm, had, not, reached, boston, until, after, the, eclipse, despite, the, fact, that, boston, is, to, the, northeast, of, philadelphia, he, deduced, that, storms, do, not, always, travel, in, the, direction, of, the, prevailing, wind, a, concept, that, greatly, influenced, meteorology, after, the, icelandic, volcanic, eruption, of, laki, in, 1783, and, the, subsequent, harsh, european, winter, of, 1784, franklin, made, observations, on, the, causal, nature, of, these, two, seemingly, separate, events, he, wrote, about, them, in, a, lecture, series, though, franklin, is, famously, associated, with, kites, from, his, lightning, experiments, he, has, also, been, noted, by, many, for, using, kites, to, pull, humans, and, ships, across, waterways, george, pocock, in, the, book, a, treatise, on, the, aeropleustic, art, or, navigation, in, the, air, by, means, of, kites, or, buoyant, sails, noted, being, inspired, by, benjamin, franklin, s, traction, of, his, body, by, kite, power, across, a, waterway, franklin, noted, a, principle, of, refrigeration, by, observing, that, on, a, very, hot, day, he, stayed, cooler, in, a, wet, shirt, in, a, breeze, than, he, did, in, a, dry, one, to, understand, this, phenomenon, more, clearly, he, conducted, experiments, in, 1758, on, a, warm, day, in, cambridge, england, he, and, fellow, scientist, john, hadley, experimented, by, continually, wetting, the, ball, of, a, mercury, thermometer, with, ether, and, using, bellows, to, evaporate, the, ether, with, each, subsequent, evaporation, the, thermometer, read, a, lower, temperature, eventually, reaching, 7, f, 14, c, another, thermometer, showed, that, the, room, temperature, was, constant, at, 65, f, 18, c, in, his, letter, cooling, by, evaporation, franklin, noted, that, one, may, see, the, possibility, of, freezing, a, man, to, death, on, a, warm, summer, s, day, in, 1761, franklin, wrote, a, letter, to, mary, stevenson, describing, his, experiments, on, the, relationship, between, color, and, heat, absorption, he, found, that, darker, color, clothes, got, hotter, when, exposed, to, sunlight, than, lighter, color, clothes, an, early, demonstration, of, black, body, thermal, radiation, one, experiment, he, performed, consisted, of, placing, square, pieces, of, cloth, of, various, color, out, in, the, snow, on, a, sunny, day, he, waited, some, time, and, then, measured, that, the, black, pieces, sank, furthest, into, the, snow, of, all, the, colors, indicating, that, they, got, the, hottest, and, melted, the, most, snow, according, to, michael, faraday, franklin, s, experiments, on, the, non, conduction, of, ice, are, worth, mentioning, although, the, law, of, the, general, effect, of, liquefaction, on, electrolytes, is, not, attributed, to, franklin, however, as, reported, in, 1836, by, franklin, s, great, grandson, alexander, dallas, bache, of, the, university, of, pennsylvania, the, law, of, the, effect, of, heat, on, the, conduction, of, bodies, otherwise, non, conductors, for, example, glass, could, be, attributed, to, franklin, franklin, wrote, a, certain, quantity, of, heat, will, make, some, bodies, good, conductors, that, will, not, otherwise, conduct, and, again, and, water, though, naturally, a, good, conductor, will, not, conduct, well, when, frozen, into, ice, while, traveling, on, a, ship, franklin, had, observed, that, the, wake, of, a, ship, was, diminished, when, the, cooks, scuttled, their, greasy, water, he, studied, the, effects, on, a, large, pond, in, clapham, common, london, i, fetched, out, a, cruet, of, oil, and, dropt, a, little, of, it, on, the, water, though, not, more, than, a, teaspoon, full, produced, an, instant, calm, over, a, space, of, several, yards, square, he, later, used, the, trick, to, calm, the, waters, by, carrying, a, little, oil, in, the, hollow, joint, of, cane, in, a, 1772, letter, to, joseph, priestley, franklin, laid, out, the, earliest, known, description, of, the, pro, con, list, a, common, decision, making, technique, now, sometimes, called, a, decisional, balance, sheet, my, way, is, to, divide, half, a, sheet, of, paper, by, a, line, into, two, columns, writing, over, the, one, pro, and, over, the, other, con, then, during, three, or, four, days, consideration, i, put, down, under, the, different, heads, short, hints, of, the, different, motives, that, at, different, times, occur, to, me, for, or, against, the, measure, when, i, have, thus, got, them, all, together, in, one, view, i, endeavour, to, estimate, their, respective, weights, and, where, i, find, two, one, on, each, side, that, seem, equal, i, strike, them, both, out, if, i, find, a, reason, pro, equal, to, some, two, reasons, con, i, strike, out, the, three, if, i, judge, some, two, reasons, con, equal, to, some, three, reasons, pro, i, strike, out, the, five, and, thus, proceeding, i, find, at, length, where, the, ballance, lies, and, if, after, a, day, or, two, of, farther, consideration, nothing, new, that, is, of, importance, occurs, on, either, side, i, come, to, a, determination, accordingly, like, the, other, advocates, of, republicanism, franklin, emphasized, that, the, new, republic, could, survive, only, if, the, people, were, virtuous, all, his, life, he, explored, the, role, of, civic, and, personal, virtue, as, expressed, in, poor, richard, s, aphorisms, he, felt, that, organized, religion, was, necessary, to, keep, men, good, to, their, fellow, men, but, rarely, attended, religious, services, himself, when, he, met, voltaire, in, paris, and, asked, his, fellow, member, of, the, enlightenment, vanguard, to, bless, his, grandson, voltaire, said, in, english, god, and, liberty, and, added, this, is, the, only, appropriate, benediction, for, the, grandson, of, monsieur, franklin, franklin, s, parents, were, both, pious, puritans, the, family, attended, the, old, south, church, the, most, liberal, puritan, congregation, in, boston, where, benjamin, franklin, was, baptized, in, 1706, franklin, s, father, a, poor, chandler, owned, a, copy, of, a, book, bonifacius, essays, to, do, good, by, the, puritan, preacher, and, family, friend, cotton, mather, which, franklin, often, cited, as, a, key, influence, on, his, life, if, i, have, been, franklin, wrote, to, cotton, mather, s, son, seventy, years, later, a, useful, citizen, the, public, owes, the, advantage, of, it, to, that, book, his, first, pen, name, silence, dogood, paid, homage, both, to, the, book, and, to, a, widely, known, sermon, by, mather, the, book, preached, the, importance, of, forming, voluntary, associations, to, benefit, society, franklin, learned, about, forming, do, good, associations, from, mather, but, his, organizational, skills, made, him, the, most, influential, force, in, making, voluntarism, an, enduring, part, of, the, american, ethos, franklin, formulated, a, presentation, of, his, beliefs, and, published, it, in, 1728, he, no, longer, accepted, the, key, puritan, ideas, regarding, salvation, the, divinity, of, jesus, or, indeed, much, religious, dogma, he, classified, himself, as, a, deist, in, his, 1771, autobiography, although, he, still, considered, himself, a, christian, he, retained, a, strong, faith, in, a, god, as, the, wellspring, of, morality, and, goodness, in, man, and, as, a, providential, actor, in, history, responsible, for, american, independence, at, a, critical, impasse, during, the, constitutional, convention, in, june, 1787, he, attempted, to, introduce, the, practice, of, daily, common, prayer, with, these, words, in, the, beginning, of, the, contest, with, g, britain, when, we, were, sensible, of, danger, we, had, daily, prayer, in, this, room, for, the, divine, protection, our, prayers, sir, were, heard, and, they, were, graciously, answered, all, of, us, who, were, engaged, in, the, struggle, must, have, observed, frequent, instances, of, a, superintending, providence, in, our, favor, and, have, we, now, forgotten, that, powerful, friend, or, do, we, imagine, that, we, no, longer, need, his, assistance, i, have, lived, sir, a, long, time, and, the, longer, i, live, the, more, convincing, proofs, i, see, of, this, truth, that, god, governs, in, the, affairs, of, men, i, therefore, beg, leave, to, move, that, henceforth, prayers, imploring, the, assistance, of, heaven, and, its, blessings, on, our, deliberations, be, held, in, this, assembly, every, morning, before, we, proceed, to, business, and, that, one, or, more, of, the, clergy, of, this, city, be, requested, to, officiate, in, that, service, the, motion, gained, almost, no, support, and, was, never, brought, to, a, vote, franklin, was, an, enthusiastic, admirer, of, the, evangelical, minister, george, whitefield, during, the, first, great, awakening, he, did, not, himself, subscribe, to, whitefield, s, theology, but, he, admired, whitefield, for, exhorting, people, to, worship, god, through, good, works, he, published, all, of, whitefield, s, sermons, and, journals, thereby, earning, a, lot, of, money, and, boosting, the, great, awakening, when, he, stopped, attending, church, franklin, wrote, in, his, autobiography, sunday, being, my, studying, day, i, never, was, without, some, religious, principles, i, never, doubted, for, instance, the, existence, of, the, deity, that, he, made, the, world, and, governed, it, by, his, providence, that, the, most, acceptable, service, of, god, was, the, doing, good, to, man, that, our, souls, are, immortal, and, that, all, crime, will, be, punished, and, virtue, rewarded, either, here, or, hereafter, franklin, retained, a, lifelong, commitment, to, the, non, religious, puritan, virtues, and, political, values, he, had, grown, up, with, and, through, his, civic, work, and, publishing, he, succeeded, in, passing, these, values, into, the, american, culture, permanently, he, had, a, passion, for, virtue, these, puritan, values, included, his, devotion, to, egalitarianism, education, industry, thrift, honesty, temperance, charity, and, community, spirit, thomas, kidd, states, as, an, adult, franklin, touted, ethical, responsibility, industriousness, and, benevolence, even, as, he, jettisoned, christian, orthodoxy, the, classical, authors, read, in, the, enlightenment, period, taught, an, abstract, ideal, of, republican, government, based, on, hierarchical, social, orders, of, king, aristocracy, and, commoners, it, was, widely, believed, that, english, liberties, relied, on, their, balance, of, power, but, also, hierarchal, deference, to, the, privileged, class, puritanism, and, the, epidemic, evangelism, of, the, mid, eighteenth, century, had, created, challenges, to, the, traditional, notions, of, social, stratification, by, preaching, that, the, bible, taught, all, men, are, equal, that, the, true, value, of, a, man, lies, in, his, moral, behavior, not, his, class, and, that, all, men, can, be, saved, franklin, steeped, in, puritanism, and, an, enthusiastic, supporter, of, the, evangelical, movement, rejected, the, salvation, dogma, but, embraced, the, radical, notion, of, egalitarian, democracy, franklin, s, commitment, to, teach, these, values, was, itself, something, he, gained, from, his, puritan, upbringing, with, its, stress, on, inculcating, virtue, and, character, in, themselves, and, their, communities, these, puritan, values, and, the, desire, to, pass, them, on, were, one, of, his, quintessentially, american, characteristics, and, helped, shape, the, character, of, the, nation, max, weber, considered, franklin, s, ethical, writings, a, culmination, of, the, protestant, ethic, which, ethic, created, the, social, conditions, necessary, for, the, birth, of, capitalism, one, of, his, notable, characteristics, was, his, respect, tolerance, and, promotion, of, all, churches, referring, to, his, experience, in, philadelphia, he, wrote, in, his, autobiography, new, places, of, worship, were, continually, wanted, and, generally, erected, by, voluntary, contribution, my, mite, for, such, purpose, whatever, might, be, the, sect, was, never, refused, he, helped, create, a, new, type, of, nation, that, would, draw, strength, from, its, religious, pluralism, the, evangelical, revivalists, who, were, active, mid, century, such, as, whitefield, were, the, greatest, advocates, of, religious, freedom, claiming, liberty, of, conscience, to, be, an, inalienable, right, of, every, rational, creature, whitefield, s, supporters, in, philadelphia, including, franklin, erected, a, large, new, hall, that, could, provide, a, pulpit, to, anyone, of, any, belief, franklin, s, rejection, of, dogma, and, doctrine, and, his, stress, on, the, god, of, ethics, and, morality, and, civic, virtue, made, him, the, prophet, of, tolerance, he, composed, a, parable, against, persecution, an, apocryphal, 51st, chapter, of, genesis, in, which, god, teaches, abraham, the, duty, of, tolerance, while, he, was, living, in, london, in, 1774, he, was, present, at, the, birth, of, british, unitarianism, attending, the, inaugural, session, of, the, essex, street, chapel, at, which, theophilus, lindsey, drew, together, the, first, avowedly, unitarian, congregation, in, england, this, was, somewhat, politically, risky, and, pushed, religious, tolerance, to, new, boundaries, as, a, denial, of, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, was, illegal, until, the, 1813, act, although, his, parents, had, intended, for, him, a, career, in, the, church, franklin, as, a, young, man, adopted, the, enlightenment, religious, belief, in, deism, that, god, s, truths, can, be, found, entirely, through, nature, and, reason, declaring, i, soon, became, a, thorough, deist, he, rejected, christian, dogma, in, a, 1725, pamphlet, a, dissertation, on, liberty, and, necessity, pleasure, and, pain, which, he, later, saw, as, an, embarrassment, while, simultaneously, asserting, that, god, is, all, wise, all, good, all, powerful, he, defended, his, rejection, of, religious, dogma, with, these, words, i, think, opinions, should, be, judged, by, their, influences, and, effects, and, if, a, man, holds, none, that, tend, to, make, him, less, virtuous, or, more, vicious, it, may, be, concluded, that, he, holds, none, that, are, dangerous, which, i, hope, is, the, case, with, me, after, the, disillusioning, experience, of, seeing, the, decay, in, his, own, moral, standards, and, those, of, two, friends, in, london, whom, he, had, converted, to, deism, franklin, decided, that, deism, was, true, but, it, was, not, as, useful, in, promoting, personal, morality, as, were, the, controls, imposed, by, organized, religion, ralph, frasca, contends, that, in, his, later, life, he, can, be, considered, a, non, denominational, christian, although, he, did, not, believe, christ, was, divine, in, a, major, scholarly, study, of, his, religion, thomas, kidd, argues, that, franklin, believed, that, true, religiosity, was, a, matter, of, personal, morality, and, civic, virtue, kidd, says, franklin, maintained, his, lifelong, resistance, to, orthodox, christianity, while, arriving, finally, at, a, doctrineless, moralized, christianity, according, to, david, morgan, franklin, was, a, proponent, of, generic, religion, he, prayed, to, powerful, goodness, and, referred, to, god, as, the, infinite, john, adams, noted, that, he, was, a, mirror, in, which, people, saw, their, own, religion, the, catholics, thought, him, almost, a, catholic, the, church, of, england, claimed, him, as, one, of, them, the, presbyterians, thought, him, half, a, presbyterian, and, the, friends, believed, him, a, wet, quaker, adams, himself, decided, that, franklin, best, fit, among, the, atheists, deists, and, libertines, whatever, else, franklin, was, concludes, morgan, he, was, a, true, champion, of, generic, religion, in, a, letter, to, richard, price, franklin, states, that, he, believes, religion, should, support, itself, without, help, from, the, government, claiming, when, a, religion, is, good, i, conceive, that, it, will, support, itself, and, when, it, cannot, support, itself, and, god, does, not, take, care, to, support, so, that, its, professors, are, oblig, d, to, call, for, the, help, of, the, civil, power, it, is, a, sign, i, apprehend, of, its, being, a, bad, one, in, 1790, just, about, a, month, before, he, died, franklin, wrote, a, letter, to, ezra, stiles, president, of, yale, university, who, had, asked, him, his, views, on, religion, as, to, jesus, of, nazareth, my, opinion, of, whom, you, particularly, desire, i, think, the, system, of, morals, and, his, religion, as, he, left, them, to, us, the, best, the, world, ever, saw, or, is, likely, to, see, but, i, apprehend, it, has, received, various, corrupt, changes, and, i, have, with, most, of, the, present, dissenters, in, england, some, doubts, as, to, his, divinity, tho, it, is, a, question, i, do, not, dogmatize, upon, having, never, studied, it, and, i, think, it, needless, to, busy, myself, with, it, now, when, i, expect, soon, an, opportunity, of, knowing, the, truth, with, less, trouble, i, see, no, harm, however, in, its, being, believed, if, that, belief, has, the, good, consequence, as, it, probably, has, of, making, his, doctrines, more, respected, and, better, observed, especially, as, i, do, not, perceive, that, the, supreme, takes, it, amiss, by, distinguishing, the, unbelievers, in, his, government, of, the, world, with, any, particular, marks, of, his, displeasure, on, july, 4, 1776, congress, appointed, a, three, member, committee, composed, of, franklin, jefferson, and, adams, to, design, the, great, seal, of, the, united, states, franklin, s, proposal, which, was, not, adopted, featured, the, motto, rebellion, to, tyrants, is, obedience, to, god, and, a, scene, from, the, book, of, exodus, he, took, from, the, frontispiece, of, the, geneva, bible, with, moses, the, israelites, the, pillar, of, fire, and, george, iii, depicted, as, pharaoh, the, design, that, was, produced, was, not, acted, upon, by, congress, and, the, great, seal, s, design, was, not, finalized, until, a, third, committee, was, appointed, in, 1782, franklin, strongly, supported, the, right, to, freedom, of, speech, in, those, wretched, countries, where, a, man, cannot, call, his, tongue, his, own, he, can, scarce, call, anything, his, own, whoever, would, overthrow, the, liberty, of, a, nation, must, begin, by, subduing, the, freeness, of, speech, without, freedom, of, thought, there, can, be, no, such, thing, as, wisdom, and, no, such, thing, as, public, liberty, without, freedom, of, speech, which, is, the, right, of, every, man, franklin, sought, to, cultivate, his, character, by, a, plan, of, 13, virtues, which, he, developed, at, age, 20, in, 1726, and, continued, to, practice, in, some, form, for, the, rest, of, his, life, his, autobiography, lists, his, 13, virtues, as, franklin, did, not, try, to, work, on, them, all, at, once, instead, he, worked, on, only, one, each, week, leaving, all, others, to, their, ordinary, chance, while, he, did, not, adhere, completely, to, the, enumerated, virtues, and, by, his, own, admission, he, fell, short, of, them, many, times, he, believed, the, attempt, made, him, a, better, man, contributing, greatly, to, his, success, and, happiness, which, is, why, in, his, autobiography, he, devoted, more, pages, to, this, plan, than, to, any, other, single, point, and, wrote, i, hope, therefore, that, some, of, my, descendants, may, follow, the, example, and, reap, the, benefit, franklin, s, views, and, practices, concerning, slavery, evolved, over, the, course, of, his, life, in, his, early, years, franklin, owned, seven, slaves, including, two, men, who, worked, in, his, household, and, his, shop, but, in, his, later, years, became, an, adherent, of, abolition, a, revenue, stream, for, his, newspaper, was, paid, ads, for, the, sale, of, slaves, and, for, the, capture, of, runaway, slaves, and, allowed, the, sale, of, slaves, in, his, general, store, he, later, became, an, outspoken, critic, of, slavery, in, 1758, he, advocated, the, opening, of, a, school, for, the, education, of, black, slaves, in, philadelphia, he, took, two, slaves, to, england, with, him, peter, and, king, king, escaped, with, a, woman, to, live, in, the, outskirts, of, london, and, by, 1758, he, was, working, for, a, household, in, suffolk, after, returning, from, england, in, 1762, franklin, became, notably, more, abolitionist, in, nature, attacking, american, slavery, in, the, wake, of, somerset, v, stewart, he, voiced, frustration, at, british, abolitionists, o, pharisaical, britain, to, pride, thyself, in, setting, free, a, single, slave, that, happens, to, land, on, thy, coasts, while, thy, merchants, in, all, thy, ports, are, encouraged, by, thy, laws, to, continue, a, commerce, whereby, so, many, hundreds, of, thousands, are, dragged, into, a, slavery, that, can, scarce, be, said, to, end, with, their, lives, since, it, is, entailed, on, their, posterity, franklin, refused, to, publicly, debate, the, issue, of, slavery, at, the, 1787, constitutional, convention, at, the, time, of, the, american, founding, there, were, about, half, a, million, slaves, in, the, united, states, mostly, in, the, five, southernmost, states, where, they, made, up, 40, of, the, population, many, of, the, leading, american, founders, most, notably, thomas, jefferson, george, washington, and, james, madison, owned, slaves, but, many, others, did, not, benjamin, franklin, thought, that, slavery, was, an, atrocious, debasement, of, human, nature, and, a, source, of, serious, evils, in, 1787, franklin, and, benjamin, rush, helped, write, a, new, constitution, for, the, pennsylvania, society, for, promoting, the, abolition, of, slavery, and, that, same, year, franklin, became, president, of, the, organization, in, 1790, quakers, from, new, york, and, pennsylvania, presented, their, petition, for, abolition, to, congress, their, argument, against, slavery, was, backed, by, the, pennsylvania, abolitionist, society, in, his, later, years, as, congress, was, forced, to, deal, with, the, issue, of, slavery, franklin, wrote, several, essays, that, stressed, the, importance, of, the, abolition, of, slavery, and, of, the, integration, of, african, americans, into, american, society, these, writings, included, franklin, became, a, vegetarian, when, he, was, a, teenager, apprenticing, at, a, print, shop, after, coming, upon, a, book, by, the, early, vegetarian, advocate, thomas, tryon, in, addition, he, would, have, also, been, familiar, with, the, moral, arguments, espoused, by, prominent, vegetarian, quakers, in, the, colonial, era, province, of, pennsylvania, including, benjamin, lay, and, john, woolman, his, reasons, for, vegetarianism, were, based, on, health, ethics, and, economy, when, about, 16, years, of, age, i, happen, d, to, meet, with, a, book, written, by, one, tryon, recommending, a, vegetable, diet, i, determined, to, go, into, it, i, presently, found, that, i, could, save, half, what, paid, me, this, was, an, additional, fund, for, buying, books, but, i, had, another, advantage, in, it, i, made, the, greater, progress, from, that, greater, clearness, of, head, and, quicker, apprehension, which, usually, attend, temperance, in, eating, and, drinking, franklin, also, declared, the, consumption, of, meat, to, be, unprovoked, murder, despite, his, convictions, he, began, to, eat, fish, after, being, tempted, by, fried, cod, on, a, boat, sailing, from, boston, justifying, the, eating, of, animals, by, observing, that, the, fish, s, stomach, contained, other, fish, nonetheless, he, recognized, the, faulty, ethics, in, this, argument, and, would, continue, to, be, a, vegetarian, on, and, off, he, was, excited, by, tofu, which, he, learned, of, from, the, writings, of, a, spanish, missionary, to, southeast, asia, domingo, fern, ndez, navarrete, franklin, sent, a, sample, of, soybeans, to, prominent, american, botanist, john, bartram, and, had, previously, written, to, british, diplomat, and, chinese, trade, expert, james, flint, inquiring, as, to, how, tofu, was, made, with, their, correspondence, believed, to, be, the, first, documented, use, of, the, word, tofu, in, the, english, language, franklin, s, second, reply, to, vindex, patriae, a, 1766, letter, advocating, self, sufficiency, and, less, dependence, on, england, lists, various, examples, of, the, bounty, of, american, agricultural, products, and, does, not, mention, meat, detailing, new, american, customs, he, wrote, that, hey, resolved, last, spring, to, eat, no, more, lamb, and, not, a, joint, of, lamb, has, since, been, seen, on, any, of, their, tables, the, sweet, little, creatures, are, all, alive, to, this, day, with, the, prettiest, fleeces, on, their, backs, imaginable, the, concept, of, preventing, smallpox, by, variolation, was, introduced, to, colonial, america, by, an, african, slave, named, onesimus, via, his, owner, cotton, mather, in, the, early, eighteenth, century, but, the, procedure, was, not, immediately, accepted, james, franklin, s, newspaper, carried, articles, in, 1721, that, vigorously, denounced, the, concept, however, by, 1736, benjamin, franklin, was, known, as, a, supporter, of, the, procedure, therefore, when, four, year, old, franky, died, of, smallpox, opponents, of, the, procedure, circulated, rumors, that, the, child, had, been, inoculated, and, that, this, was, the, cause, of, his, subsequent, death, when, franklin, became, aware, of, this, gossip, he, placed, a, notice, in, the, pennsylvania, gazette, stating, i, do, hereby, sincerely, declare, that, he, was, not, inoculated, but, receiv, d, the, distemper, in, the, common, way, of, infection, i, intended, to, have, my, child, inoculated, the, child, had, a, bad, case, of, flux, diarrhea, and, his, parents, had, waited, for, him, to, get, well, before, having, him, inoculated, franklin, wrote, in, his, autobiography, in, 1736, i, lost, one, of, my, sons, a, fine, boy, of, four, years, old, by, the, small, pox, taken, in, the, common, way, i, long, regretted, bitterly, and, still, regret, that, i, had, not, given, it, to, him, by, inoculation, this, i, mention, for, the, sake, of, parents, who, omit, that, operation, on, the, supposition, that, they, should, never, forgive, themselves, if, a, child, died, under, it, my, example, showing, that, the, regret, may, be, the, same, either, way, and, that, therefore, the, safer, should, be, chosen, franklin, is, known, to, have, played, the, violin, the, harp, and, the, guitar, he, also, composed, music, notably, a, string, quartet, in, early, classical, style, while, he, was, in, london, he, developed, a, much, improved, version, of, the, glass, harmonica, in, which, the, glasses, rotate, on, a, shaft, with, the, player, s, fingers, held, steady, instead, of, the, other, way, around, he, worked, with, the, london, glassblower, charles, james, to, create, it, and, instruments, based, on, his, mechanical, version, soon, found, their, way, to, other, parts, of, europe, joseph, haydn, a, fan, of, franklin, s, enlightened, ideas, had, a, glass, harmonica, in, his, instrument, collection, mozart, composed, for, franklin, s, glass, harmonica, as, did, beethoven, gaetano, donizetti, used, the, instrument, in, the, accompaniment, to, amelia, s, aria, par, che, mi, dica, ancora, in, the, tragic, opera, il, castello, di, kenilworth, 1821, as, did, camille, saint, sa, ns, in, his, 1886, the, carnival, of, the, animals, richard, strauss, calls, for, the, glass, harmonica, in, his, 1917, die, frau, ohne, schatten, and, numerous, other, composers, used, franklin, s, instrument, as, well, franklin, was, an, avid, chess, player, he, was, playing, chess, by, around, 1733, making, him, the, first, chess, player, known, by, name, in, the, american, colonies, his, essay, on, the, morals, of, chess, in, columbian, magazine, in, december, 1786, is, the, second, known, writing, on, chess, in, america, this, essay, in, praise, of, chess, and, prescribing, a, code, of, behavior, for, the, game, has, been, widely, reprinted, and, translated, he, and, a, friend, used, chess, as, a, means, of, learning, the, italian, language, which, both, were, studying, the, winner, of, each, game, between, them, had, the, right, to, assign, a, task, such, as, parts, of, the, italian, grammar, to, be, learned, by, heart, to, be, performed, by, the, loser, before, their, next, meeting, franklin, was, able, to, play, chess, more, frequently, against, stronger, opposition, during, his, many, years, as, a, civil, servant, and, diplomat, in, england, where, the, game, was, far, better, established, than, in, america, he, was, able, to, improve, his, playing, standard, by, facing, more, experienced, players, during, this, period, he, regularly, attended, old, slaughter, s, coffee, house, in, london, for, chess, and, socializing, making, many, important, personal, contacts, while, in, paris, both, as, a, visitor, and, later, as, ambassador, he, visited, the, famous, caf, de, la, r, gence, which, france, s, strongest, players, made, their, regular, meeting, place, no, records, of, his, games, have, survived, so, it, is, not, possible, to, ascertain, his, playing, strength, in, modern, terms, franklin, was, inducted, into, the, u, s, chess, hall, of, fame, in, 1999, the, franklin, mercantile, chess, club, in, philadelphia, the, second, oldest, chess, club, in, the, u, s, is, named, in, his, honor, franklin, bequeathed, 1, 000, about, 4, 400, at, the, time, or, about, 125, 000, in, 2021, dollars, each, to, the, cities, of, boston, and, philadelphia, in, trust, to, gather, interest, for, 200, years, the, trust, began, in, 1785, when, the, french, mathematician, charles, joseph, mathon, de, la, cour, who, admired, franklin, greatly, wrote, a, friendly, parody, of, franklin, s, poor, richard, s, almanack, called, fortunate, richard, the, main, character, leaves, a, smallish, amount, of, money, in, his, will, five, lots, of, 100, livres, to, collect, interest, over, one, two, three, four, or, five, full, centuries, with, the, resulting, astronomical, sums, to, be, spent, on, impossibly, elaborate, utopian, projects, franklin, who, was, 79, years, old, at, the, time, wrote, thanking, him, for, a, great, idea, and, telling, him, that, he, had, decided, to, leave, a, bequest, of, 1, 000, pounds, each, to, his, native, boston, and, his, adopted, philadelphia, by, 1990, more, than, 2, 000, 000, 4, 12, million, in, 2023, had, accumulated, in, franklin, s, philadelphia, trust, which, had, loaned, the, money, to, local, residents, from, 1940, to, 1990, the, money, was, used, mostly, for, mortgage, loans, when, the, trust, came, due, philadelphia, decided, to, spend, it, on, scholarships, for, local, high, school, students, franklin, s, boston, trust, fund, accumulated, almost, 5, 000, 000, during, that, same, time, at, the, end, of, its, first, 100, years, a, portion, was, allocated, to, help, establish, a, trade, school, that, became, the, franklin, institute, of, boston, and, the, entire, fund, was, later, dedicated, to, supporting, this, institute, in, 1787, a, group, of, prominent, ministers, in, lancaster, pennsylvania, proposed, the, foundation, of, a, new, college, named, in, franklin, s, honor, franklin, donated, 200, towards, the, development, of, franklin, college, now, called, franklin, marshall, college, as, the, only, person, to, have, signed, the, declaration, of, independence, in, 1776, treaty, of, alliance, with, france, in, 1778, treaty, of, paris, in, 1783, and, u, s, constitution, in, 1787, franklin, is, considered, one, of, the, leading, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, his, pervasive, influence, in, the, early, history, of, the, nation, has, led, to, his, being, jocularly, called, the, only, president, of, the, united, states, who, was, never, president, of, the, united, states, franklin, s, likeness, is, ubiquitous, since, 1914, it, has, adorned, american, 100, bills, from, 1948, to, 1963, franklin, s, portrait, was, on, the, half, dollar, he, has, appeared, on, a, 50, bill, and, on, several, varieties, of, the, 100, bill, from, 1914, and, 1918, franklin, also, appears, on, the, 1, 000, series, ee, savings, bond, on, april, 12, 1976, as, part, of, a, bicentennial, celebration, congress, dedicated, a, 20, foot, 6, m, tall, marble, statue, in, philadelphia, s, franklin, institute, as, the, benjamin, franklin, national, memorial, vice, president, nelson, rockefeller, presided, over, the, dedication, ceremony, many, of, franklin, s, personal, possessions, are, on, display, at, the, institute, in, london, his, house, at, 36, craven, street, which, is, the, only, surviving, former, residence, of, franklin, was, first, marked, with, a, blue, plaque, and, has, since, been, opened, to, the, public, as, the, benjamin, franklin, house, in, 1998, workmen, restoring, the, building, dug, up, the, remains, of, six, children, and, four, adults, hidden, below, the, home, a, total, of, 15, bodies, have, been, recovered, the, friends, of, benjamin, franklin, house, the, organization, responsible, for, the, restoration, note, that, the, bones, were, likely, placed, there, by, william, hewson, who, lived, in, the, house, for, two, years, and, who, had, built, a, small, anatomy, school, at, the, back, of, the, house, they, note, that, while, franklin, likely, knew, what, hewson, was, doing, he, probably, did, not, participate, in, any, dissections, because, he, was, much, more, of, a, physicist, than, a, medical, man, he, has, been, honored, on, u, s, postage, stamps, many, times, the, image, of, franklin, the, first, postmaster, general, of, the, united, states, occurs, on, the, face, of, u, s, postage, more, than, any, other, notable, american, save, that, of, george, washington, he, appeared, on, the, first, u, s, postage, stamp, issued, in, 1847, from, 1908, through, 1923, the, u, s, post, office, issued, a, series, of, postage, stamps, commonly, referred, to, as, the, washington, franklin, issues, in, which, washington, and, franklin, were, depicted, many, times, over, a, 14, year, period, the, longest, run, of, any, one, series, in, u, s, postal, history, however, he, only, appears, on, a, few, commemorative, stamps, some, of, the, finest, portrayals, of, franklin, on, record, can, be, found, on, the, engravings, inscribed, on, the, face, of, u, s, postage
