chandragupta, ii, r, c, 375, 415, also, known, by, his, title, vikramaditya, as, well, as, chandragupta, vikramaditya, was, the, third, ruler, of, the, gupta, empire, in, india, modern, scholars, generally, identify, him, with, king, chandra, of, the, delhi, iron, pillar, inscription, chandragupta, ii, continued, the, expansionist, policy, of, his, father, samudragupta, through, military, conquests, and, marital, alliances, historical, evidence, attests, to, his, remarkable, victories, which, include, the, defeat, of, the, sassanids, the, conquest, of, the, western, kshatrapas, and, the, vassalization, of, the, hunas, under, the, reign, of, chandragupta, ii, the, gupta, empire, reached, its, zenith, directly, controlling, a, vast, territory, which, stretched, from, the, oxus, river, in, the, west, to, the, bengal, region, in, the, east, and, from, the, foothills, of, the, himalayas, in, the, north, to, the, narmada, river, in, the, south, chandragupta, ii, expanded, his, influence, and, indirectly, ruled, over, the, kuntala, region, of, karnataka, through, a, marriage, alliance, with, kadambas, and, during, his, daughter, prabhavatigupta, s, 20, years, long, regency, he, effectively, integrated, the, vakataka, kingdom, into, the, gupta, empire, chandragupta, ii, was, a, devout, vaishnav, but, tolerated, other, faiths, as, well, the, chinese, pilgrim, faxian, who, visited, india, during, his, reign, suggests, that, he, ruled, over, a, peaceful, and, prosperous, kingdom, the, legendary, figure, of, vikramaditya, is, probably, based, on, chandragupta, ii, among, other, kings, and, the, noted, sanskrit, poet, kalidasa, may, have, been, his, court, poet, the, cave, shrines, at, udayagiri, were, also, built, during, his, rule, chandragupta, ii, was, the, second, ruler, of, the, dynasty, to, bear, the, name, chandragupta, the, first, being, his, grandfather, chandragupta, i, he, was, also, simply, known, as, chandra, as, attested, by, his, coins, the, sanchi, inscription, of, his, officer, amrakardava, states, that, he, was, also, known, as, deva, raja, the, records, of, his, daughter, prabhavatigupta, issued, as, a, vakataka, queen, call, him, chandragupta, as, well, as, deva, gupta, deva, shri, iast, deva, ri, is, another, variation, of, this, name, the, delhi, iron, pillar, inscription, states, that, king, chandra, was, also, known, as, dhava, if, this, king, chandra, is, identified, with, chandragupta, see, below, it, appears, that, dhava, was, another, name, for, the, king, another, possibility, is, that, dhava, is, a, mistake, for, a, common, noun, bhava, although, this, is, unlikely, as, the, rest, of, the, inscription, does, not, contain, any, errors, a, passage, in, the, vishnu, purana, suggests, that, major, parts, of, the, eastern, coast, of, india, kosala, odra, tamralipta, and, puri, were, ruled, by, the, devarakshitas, around, the, same, time, as, the, guptas, since, it, seems, unlikely, that, an, obscure, dynasty, named, devarakshita, was, powerful, enough, to, control, substantial, territory, during, the, gupta, period, some, scholars, such, as, dasharatha, sharma, theorize, that, deva, rakshita, iast, devarak, ita, was, another, name, for, chandragupta, ii, others, such, as, d, k, ganguly, oppose, this, theory, arguing, that, this, identification, is, quite, arbitrary, and, cannot, be, explained, satisfactorily, chandragupta, assumed, the, titles, bhattaraka, and, maharajadhiraja, and, bore, the, epithet, apratiratha, having, no, equal, or, antagonist, the, supiya, stone, pillar, inscription, issued, during, the, reign, of, his, descendant, skandagupta, also, calls, him, vikramaditya, chandragupta, was, a, son, of, samudragupta, and, queen, dattadevi, as, attested, by, his, own, inscriptions, according, to, the, official, gupta, genealogy, chandragupta, succeeded, his, father, on, the, gupta, throne, the, sanskrit, play, devichandraguptam, combined, with, other, evidence, suggests, that, he, had, an, elder, brother, named, ramagupta, who, preceded, him, on, the, throne, in, the, play, ramagupta, decides, to, surrender, his, queen, dhruvadevi, to, a, shaka, enemy, when, besieged, but, chandragupta, goes, to, the, enemy, camp, disguised, as, the, queen, and, kills, the, enemy, sometime, later, chandragupta, dethrones, ramagupta, and, becomes, the, new, king, the, historicity, of, this, narrative, is, debated, among, modern, historians, with, some, believing, it, to, be, based, on, true, historical, events, while, others, dismissing, it, as, a, work, of, fiction, the, mathura, pillar, inscription, of, chandragupta, ii, as, well, as, some, other, gupta, inscriptions, mention, two, dates, several, historians, have, assumed, that, one, of, these, dates, denotes, the, king, s, regnal, year, while, the, other, date, denotes, the, year, of, the, gupta, calendar, era, however, indologist, harry, falk, in, 2004, has, theorised, that, the, date, understood, to, be, the, regnal, year, by, the, earlier, scholars, is, actually, a, date, of, the, k, l, nuvarttam, na, system, according, to, falk, the, k, l, nuvarttam, na, system, is, a, continuation, of, the, kushana, calendar, era, established, by, emperor, kanishka, whose, coronation, falk, dates, to, 127, ce, the, kushana, era, restarts, counting, after, a, hundred, years, e, g, the, year, after, 100, is, 1, not, 101, the, date, portion, of, the, mathura, inscription, reads, in, iast, the, letters, before, the, words, k, l, nuvarttam, na, sa, vatsare, are, abraded, in, the, inscription, but, historian, d, r, bhandarkar, 1931, 1932, reconstructed, them, as, gupta, and, translated, the, term, gupta, k, l, nuvarttam, na, sa, vatsare, as, year, following, the, gupta, era, he, translated, the, entire, sentence, as, historian, d, c, sircar, 1942, restored, the, missing, letters, as, c, me, fifth, and, concluded, that, the, inscription, was, dated, to, the, chandragupta, s, fifth, regnal, year, the, missing, letters, have, alternatively, been, read, as, prathame, first, according, to, these, interpretations, the, inscription, is, thus, dated, in, year, 61, of, the, gupta, era, and, either, the, first, or, the, fifth, regnal, year, of, chandragupta, assuming, that, the, gupta, era, starts, around, 319, 320, ce, the, beginning, of, chandragupta, s, reign, can, be, dated, to, either, 376, 377, ce, or, 380, 381, ce, falk, agrees, that, the, missing, letters, denote, a, numerical, year, but, dismisses, sircar, s, reading, as, mere, imagination, pointing, out, that, the, missing, letters, are, abraded, beyond, recovery, in, support, of, his, kushana, era, theory, falk, presents, four, gupta, inscriptions, in, chronological, order, that, mention, the, term, k, l, nuvarttam, na, sa, vatsare, falk, notes, that, the, dynastic, year, in, the, table, above, appears, to, be, a, year, of, the, gupta, era, the, k, l, nuvarttam, na, year, cannot, be, regnal, year, because, chandragupta, i, is, not, known, to, have, ruled, for, as, long, as, 61, years, if, we, assume, 61, of, the, mathura, pillar, inscription, denotes, a, year, of, the, gupta, era, as, assumed, by, bhandarkar, sircar, and, other, scholars, we, must, assume, that, 15, of, the, buddhist, image, pedestal, also, denotes, a, year, of, the, gupta, era, this, is, obviously, incorrect, since, kumaragupta, i, ruled, after, chandragupta, ii, scholars, k, k, thaplyal, and, r, c, sharma, who, studied, the, buddhist, image, pedestal, inscription, speculated, that, the, scribe, had, mistakenly, interchanged, the, years, 121, and, 15, but, falk, calls, this, assumption, unnecessary, according, to, falk, the, discrepancy, can, be, explained, satisfactorily, if, we, assume, that, the, k, l, nuvarttam, na, era, denotes, a, system, that, restarts, counting, after, a, hundred, years, the, yaksha, figure, inscription, is, dated, to, year, 112, of, the, gupta, era, c, 432, ce, which, corresponds, to, the, k, l, nuvarttam, na, year, 5, thus, the, k, l, nuvarttam, na, era, used, during, kumaragupta, s, time, must, have, started, in, 432, 5, 427, ce, the, years, mentioned, in, the, buddhist, image, pedestal, inscription, also, suggests, that, the, epoch, of, this, era, was, c, 426, 427, ce, since, the, k, l, nuvarttam, na, system, restarts, counting, every, 100, years, the, k, l, nuvarttam, na, era, used, during, the, reign, of, chandragupta, ii, must, have, started, in, 327, ce, thus, the, mathura, inscription, can, be, dated, to, 327, 61, c, 388, ce, while, falk, s, theory, does, not, change, the, gupta, chronology, significantly, it, implies, that, the, date, of, the, mathura, inscription, cannot, be, used, to, determine, the, beginning, of, chandragupta, s, reign, the, sanchi, inscription, dated, to, 412, 413, ce, year, 93, of, the, gupta, era, is, the, last, known, dated, inscription, of, chandragupta, his, son, kumaragupta, was, on, the, throne, by, the, 415, 416, ce, year, 96, of, the, gupta, era, so, chandragupta, s, reign, must, have, ended, sometime, during, 412, 415, ce, the, udayagiri, inscription, of, chandragupta, s, foreign, minister, virasena, suggests, that, the, king, had, a, distinguished, military, career, it, states, that, he, bought, the, earth, paying, for, it, with, his, prowess, and, reduced, the, other, kings, to, the, status, of, slaves, his, empire, seems, to, have, extended, from, the, mouth, of, the, indus, and, northern, pakistan, in, the, west, to, the, bengal, region, in, the, east, and, from, the, himalayan, terai, region, in, the, north, to, the, narmada, river, in, the, south, chandragupta, s, father, samudragupta, and, his, son, kumaragupta, i, are, known, to, have, performed, the, ashvamedha, horse, sacrifice, to, proclaim, their, military, prowess, in, the, 20th, century, the, discovery, of, a, stone, image, of, a, horse, found, near, varanasi, and, the, misreading, of, its, inscription, as, chandramgu, taken, to, be, chandragupta, led, to, speculation, that, chandragupta, also, performed, the, ashvamedha, sacrifice, however, there, is, no, actual, evidence, to, support, this, theory, historical, and, literary, evidence, suggests, that, chandragupta, ii, achieved, military, successes, against, the, western, kshatrapas, also, known, as, shakas, who, ruled, in, west, central, india, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, of, chandragupta, s, father, samudragupta, names, the, shaka, murundas, among, the, kings, who, tried, to, appease, him, it, may, be, possible, that, samudragupta, reduced, the, shakas, to, a, state, of, subordinate, alliance, and, chandragupta, completely, subjugated, them, virasena, s, udayagiri, inscription, describes, him, as, a, resident, of, pataliputra, and, states, that, he, came, to, udayagiri, in, central, india, with, the, king, who, sought, to, conquer, the, whole, world, this, indicates, that, chandragupta, had, reached, udayagiri, in, central, india, during, a, military, campaign, the, theory, that, chandragupta, led, an, army, to, central, india, is, also, corroborated, by, the, c, 412, 413, ce, gupta, year, 93, sanchi, inscription, of, amrakardava, who, is, said, to, have, acquired, victory, and, fame, in, many, battles, and, whose, livelihood, was, secured, by, serving, chandragupta, a, c, 401, 402, ce, gupta, year, 82, inscription, of, chandragupta, s, feudatory, maharaja, sanakanika, has, also, been, discovered, in, central, india, the, only, important, power, to, have, ruled, in, this, region, during, chandragupta, s, period, were, the, western, kshatrapas, whose, rule, is, attested, by, their, distinct, coinage, the, coins, issued, by, the, western, kshatrapa, rulers, abruptly, come, to, end, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 4th, century, the, coins, of, this, type, reappear, in, the, second, decade, of, the, 5th, century, and, are, dated, in, the, gupta, era, which, suggests, that, chandragupta, subjugated, the, western, kshatrapas, the, exact, date, of, chandragupta, s, victory, is, not, known, but, it, can, be, tentatively, dated, to, sometime, between, 397, and, 409, the, last, of, the, 4th, century, kshatrapa, coins, that, of, rudrasimha, iii, can, be, dated, to, the, shaka, year, 310, or, 319, the, coin, legend, is, partially, lost, that, is, 388, or, 397, chandragupta, s, coins, dated, to, 409, are, similar, to, the, kshtrapa, coins, with, the, shakas, buddhist, vihara, symbol, replaced, by, the, gupta, symbol, of, garuda, literary, evidence, also, corroborates, chandragupta, s, victory, over, the, western, kshatrapas, the, sanskrit, play, devichandraguptam, whose, historicity, is, disputed, narrates, that, chandragupta, s, elder, brother, ramagupta, agreed, to, surrender, his, queen, dhruvadevi, to, a, shaka, chief, when, besieged, but, chandragupta, went, to, the, enemy, camp, disguised, as, the, queen, and, killed, the, shaka, chief, chandragupta, bore, the, title, vikramaditya, and, several, indian, legends, talk, of, king, vikramaditya, who, defeated, the, shakas, several, modern, scholars, have, theorised, that, these, legends, may, be, based, on, chandragupta, s, victory, over, the, shakas, as, a, result, of, his, victory, over, the, western, kshatrapas, chandragupta, must, have, extended, his, empire, up, to, the, arabian, sea, coast, in, present, day, gujarat, the, iron, pillar, of, delhi, contains, an, inscription, of, a, king, called, chandra, modern, scholars, generally, identify, this, king, with, chandragupta, ii, although, this, cannot, be, said, with, complete, certainty, while, alternative, identifications, have, been, proposed, there, is, strong, evidence, for, identifying, chandra, of, the, iron, pillar, inscription, as, chandragupta, ii, the, iron, pillar, inscription, credits, chandra, with, the, following, victories, if, chandra, is, identified, with, chandragupta, it, appears, that, chandragupta, marched, through, the, punjab, region, and, advanced, up, to, the, country, of, the, vahlikas, that, is, balkh, in, present, day, afghanistan, some, short, sanskrit, inscriptions, at, the, sacred, rock, of, hunza, in, present, day, pakistan, written, in, gupta, script, mention, the, name, chandra, a, few, of, these, inscriptions, also, mention, the, name, harishena, and, one, particular, inscription, mentions, chandra, with, the, epithet, vikramaditya, based, on, the, identification, of, chandra, with, chandragupta, and, harishena, with, the, gupta, courtier, harishena, these, inscriptions, can, be, considered, as, further, evidence, of, a, gupta, military, campaign, in, the, area, however, this, identification, is, not, certain, and, chandra, of, the, hunza, inscriptions, could, have, well, been, a, local, ruler, according, to, sten, konow, the, term, seven, faces, mentioned, in, the, iron, pillar, inscription, refers, to, the, seven, mouths, of, indus, historians, r, c, majumdar, and, k, p, jayaswal, on, the, other, hand, believe, that, the, term, refers, to, the, tributaries, of, indus, the, five, rivers, of, punjab, jhelum, ravi, sutlej, beas, and, chenab, plus, possibly, the, kabul, and, the, kunar, rivers, it, is, quite, possible, that, chandragupta, passed, through, the, punjab, region, during, this, campaign, his, political, influence, in, this, region, is, attested, to, by, the, use, of, the, gupta, era, in, an, inscription, found, at, shorkot, and, by, some, coins, bearing, the, name, chandragupta, however, there, is, no, evidence, that, chandragupta, annexed, punjab, to, the, gupta, empire, which, suggests, that, chandragupta, s, victory, in, this, region, was, not, a, decisive, one, there, is, little, evidence, of, gupta, influence, in, punjab, after, his, reign, numismatic, evidence, suggests, that, punjab, was, ruled, by, petty, chieftains, after, his, death, these, chieftains, bore, indian, names, but, issued, coins, that, imitate, the, kidarite, coinage, they, may, have, been, hinduized, foreigners, or, indians, continuing, the, usage, of, foreign, style, coinage, the, identification, of, chandra, with, chandragupta, ii, also, suggests, chandragupta, achieved, victories, in, the, vanga, area, in, the, present, day, bengal, region, according, to, the, allahabad, pillar, inscription, of, his, father, samudragupta, the, samatata, kingdom, of, the, bengal, region, was, a, gupta, tributary, the, guptas, are, known, to, have, been, ruling, bengal, in, the, early, 6th, century, although, there, are, no, surviving, records, of, the, gupta, presence, in, this, region, for, the, intervening, period, it, is, possible, that, a, large, part, of, the, bengal, region, was, annexed, to, the, gupta, empire, by, chandragupta, and, that, this, control, continued, into, the, 6th, century, the, delhi, iron, pillar, inscription, suggests, that, an, alliance, of, semi, independent, chiefs, of, bengal, unsuccessfully, resisted, chandragupta, s, attempts, to, extend, the, gupta, influence, in, this, region, gupta, records, mention, dhruvadevi, as, chandragupta, s, queen, and, the, mother, of, his, successor, kumaragupta, i, the, basarh, clay, seal, mentions, dhruva, svamini, as, a, queen, of, chandragupta, and, the, mother, of, govindagupta, it, is, unlikely, that, chandragupta, had, two, different, queens, with, similar, names, it, appears, that, dhruvasvamini, was, most, probably, another, name, for, dhruvadevi, and, that, govindagupta, was, a, real, brother, of, kumaragupta, chandragupta, also, married, kuvera, naga, alias, kuberanaga, whose, name, indicates, that, she, was, a, princess, of, the, naga, dynasty, which, held, considerable, power, in, central, india, before, samudragupta, subjugated, them, this, matrimonial, alliance, may, have, helped, chandragupta, consolidate, the, gupta, empire, and, the, nagas, may, have, helped, him, in, his, war, against, the, western, kshatrapas, prabhavati, gupta, the, daughter, of, chandragupta, and, kuvera, naga, married, the, vakataka, king, rudrasena, ii, who, ruled, in, the, deccan, region, to, the, south, of, the, gupta, empire, after, her, husband, s, death, in, c, 390, prabhavati, gupta, acted, as, a, regent, for, her, minor, sons, in, the, two, copper, plate, inscriptions, issued, during, her, regency, the, names, of, her, gupta, ancestors, with, their, imperial, titles, appear, before, the, name, of, the, vakataka, king, with, the, lesser, title, maharaja, this, suggests, that, the, gupta, court, may, have, had, influence, in, the, vakataka, administration, during, her, regency, historians, hermann, kulke, and, dietmar, rothermund, believe, that, the, vakataka, kingdom, was, practically, a, part, of, the, gupta, empire, during, her, 20, year, long, regency, the, vakatakas, may, have, supported, chandragupta, during, his, conflict, with, the, western, kshatrapas, the, guptas, also, appear, to, have, entered, into, a, matrimonial, alliance, with, the, kadamba, dynasty, the, southern, neighbours, of, the, vakatakas, the, talagunda, pillar, inscription, suggests, that, the, daughters, of, the, kadamba, king, kakusthavarman, married, into, other, royal, families, including, that, of, the, guptas, while, kakusthavarman, was, a, contemporary, of, chandragupta, s, son, kumaragupta, i, it, is, noteworthy, that, some, medieval, chiefs, of, present, day, karnataka, where, the, kadambas, ruled, claimed, descent, from, chandragupta, according, to, the, vikramaditya, legends, emperor, vikramaditya, a, character, believed, to, be, based, on, chandragupta, sent, his, court, poet, kalidasa, as, an, ambassador, to, the, lord, of, kuntala, while, the, kuntala, king, referred, to, in, this, legend, has, been, identified, by, some, scholars, with, a, vakataka, king, it, is, more, likely, that, he, was, a, kadamba, king, because, the, vakataka, king, did, not, rule, over, kuntala, and, was, never, called, the, lord, of, kuntala, several, feudatories, of, chandragupta, are, known, from, historical, records, the, following, ministers, and, officers, of, chandragupta, are, known, from, various, historical, records, jyotirvidabharana, 22, 10, a, treatise, attributed, to, kalidasa, states, that, nine, famous, scholars, known, as, the, navaratnas, nine, gems, attended, the, court, of, the, legendary, vikramaditya, besides, kalidasa, himself, these, included, amarasimha, dhanvantari, ghatakarapara, kshapanaka, shanku, varahamihira, vararuchi, and, vetala, bhatta, however, there, is, no, historical, evidence, to, show, that, these, nine, scholars, were, contemporary, figures, or, proteges, of, the, same, king, jyotirvidabharana, is, considered, a, literary, forgery, of, a, date, later, than, kalidasa, by, multiple, scholars, there, is, no, mention, of, such, navaratnas, in, earlier, literature, and, d, c, sircar, calls, this, tradition, absolutely, worthless, for, historical, purposes, nevertheless, multiple, scholars, believe, that, one, of, these, navaratnas, kalidasa, may, have, indeed, flourished, during, the, reign, of, chandragupta, ii, these, scholars, include, william, jones, a, b, keith, and, vasudev, vishnu, mirashi, among, others, it, is, possible, that, kalidasa, was, a, court, poet, of, chandragupta, many, gold, and, silver, coins, of, chandragupta, as, well, the, inscriptions, issued, by, him, and, his, successors, describe, him, as, a, parama, bhagvata, that, is, a, devotee, of, the, god, vishnu, one, of, his, gold, coins, discovered, at, bayana, calls, him, chakra, vikramah, literally, powerful, discus, and, shows, him, receiving, a, discus, from, vishnu, an, udayagiri, inscription, records, the, construction, of, a, vaishnava, cave, temple, by, chandragupta, s, feudatory, maharaja, sanakanika, in, year, 82, of, the, gupta, era, c, 401, 402, chandragupta, was, also, tolerant, of, other, faiths, the, udayagiri, inscription, of, chandragupta, s, foreign, minister, virasena, records, the, construction, of, a, temple, dedicated, to, the, god, shambhu, shiva, an, inscription, found, at, sanchi, near, udayagiri, records, donations, to, the, local, buddhist, monastery, by, his, military, officer, amrakardava, in, year, 93, of, the, gupta, era, c, 412, 413, chinese, pilgrim, faxian, visited, india, during, the, reign, of, chandragupta, and, spent, around, six, years, in, the, gupta, kingdom, he, was, mostly, interested, in, buddhist, religious, affairs, and, did, not, bother, to, record, the, name, of, the, reigning, king, his, account, presents, an, idealised, picture, of, the, gupta, administration, and, not, everything, he, states, can, be, taken, at, face, value, however, his, description, of, the, kingdom, as, a, peaceful, and, prosperous, one, seems, to, be, generally, true, attested, by, the, fact, that, he, did, not, face, any, brigandage, unlike, the, later, chinese, pilgrim, xuanzang, faxian, describes, madhya, desha, middle, kingdom, the, region, to, the, south, east, of, mathura, as, a, populous, region, with, good, climate, and, happy, people, he, mentions, that, the, citizens, were, not, required, to, register, their, households, or, attend, to, any, magistrates, and, their, rules, faxian, mentions, that, wicked, repeated, rebels, had, their, right, hand, cut, off, by, the, king, s, administration, but, otherwise, there, was, no, corporal, punishment, for, crimes, the, criminals, were, only, fined, lightly, or, heavily, according, to, the, severity, of, the, crime, according, to, faxian, the, king, s, bodyguards, and, attendants, all, received, salaries, faxian, mentions, that, other, than, the, untouchable, chandalas, the, people, did, not, consume, meat,
