stir, by, submitting, an, instrumental, fugue, rather, than, the, required, vocal, fugue, the, subject, was, taken, up, by, the, national, and, international, newspapers, and, was, resolved, only, when, the, french, minister, of, public, information, decreed, that, boulanger, s, work, be, judged, on, its, musical, merit, alone, she, won, the, second, grand, prix, for, her, cantata, la, sir, ne, in, 1908, as, well, as, performing, piano, duets, in, public, concerts, boulanger, and, pugno, collaborated, on, composing, a, song, cycle, les, heures, claires, which, was, well, received, enough,

during, the, war, lili, began, to, suffer, ill, health, she, died, in, march, 1918, nadia, struggled, with, the, death, of, her, sister, and, according, to, jeanice, brooks, he, dichotomy, between, private, grief, and, public, strength, was, strongly, characteristic, of, boulanger, s, frame, of, mind, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, world, war, i, guilt, at, surviving, her, talented, sibling, seems, to, have, led, to, determination, to, deserve, lili, s, death, which, nadia, framed, as, redemptive, sacrifice, by, throwing, herself, into, work, and, domestic, responsibility, as, nadia, wrote, in, her, datebook, in, january, 1919, i, place, this, new, year, before, you, my, little, beloved, lili, may, it, see, me, fulfill, my, duty, towards, you, so, that, it, is, less, terrible, for, mother, and, that, i, try, to, resemble, you, in, 1919, boulanger, performed, in, more, than, twenty, concerts, often, programming, her, own, music, and, that, of, her, sister, since, the,

normale, de, musique, de, paris, boulanger, was, invited, by, cortot, to, join, the, school, where, she, taught, classes, in, harmony, counterpoint, musical, analysis, organ, and, composition, mangeot, also, asked, boulanger, to, contribute, articles, of, music, criticism, to, his, paper, le, monde, musical, and, she, occasionally, provided, articles, for, this, and, other, newspapers, for, the, rest, of, her, life, though, she, never, felt, at, ease, setting, her, opinions, down, for, posterity, in, this, way, in, 1920, boulanger, began, to, compose, again, writing, a, series, of, songs, to, words, by, camille, mauclair, in, 1921, she, performed, at, two, concerts, in, support, of, women, s, rights, both, of, which, featured, music, by, lili, however, later, in, life, she, claimed, never, to, have, been, involved, with, feminism, and, that, women, should, not, have, the, right, to, vote, as, they, lacked, the, necessary, political, sophistication, in, the, summer, of, 1921, the, french, music, school, for, americans, opened, in, fontainebleau, with, boulanger, listed, on, the, programme, as, a, professor, of, harmony, her, close, friend, isidor, philipp, headed, the, piano, departments, of, both, the, paris, conservatory, and, the, new, fontainebleau, school, and, was, an, important, draw, for, american, students, she, inaugurated, the, custom, which, would, continue, for, the, rest, of, her, life, of, inviting, the, best, students, to, her, summer, residence, at, gargenville, one, weekend, for, lunch, and, dinner, among, the, students, attending, the, first, year, at, fontainebleau, was, aaron, copland, boulanger, s, unrelenting, schedule, of, teaching, performing, composing, and, writing, letters, started, to, take, its, toll, on, her, health, she, had, frequent, migraines, and, toothaches, she, stopped, writing, as, a, critic, for, le, monde, musical, as, she, could, not, attend, the, requisite, concerts, to, maintain, her, and, her, mother, s, living, standards, she, concentrated, on, teaching, which, was, her, most, lucrative, source, of, income, faur, believed, she, was, mistaken, to, stop, composing, but, she, told, him, if, there, is, one, thing, of, which, i, am, certain, it, is, that, i, wrote, useless, music, in, 1924, walter, damrosch, arthur, judson, and, the, new, york, symphony, society, arranged, for, boulanger,

children, when, nothing, came, of, it, she, abandoned, trying, to, write, about, her, ideas, gershwin, visited, boulanger, in, 1927, asking, for, lessons, in, composition, they, spoke, for, half, an, hour, after, which, boulanger, announced, i, can, teach, you, nothing, taking, this, as, a, compliment, gershwin, repeated, the, story, many, times, the, great, depression, increased, social, tensions, in, france, days, after, the, stavisky, riots, in, february, 1934, and, in, the, midst, of, a, general, strike, boulanger, resumed, conducting, she, made, her, paris, debut, with, the,

reviewers, approved, her, use, of, modern, instruments, when, hindemith, published, his, the, craft, of, musical, composition, boulanger, asked, him, for, permission, to, translate, the, text, into,

asked, about, the, difference, between, a, well, made, work, and, a, masterpiece, boulanger, replied, i, can, tell, whether, a, piece, is, well, made, or, not, and, i, believe, that, there, are, conditions, without, which, masterpieces, cannot, be, achieved, but, i, also, believe, that, what, defines, a, masterpiece, cannot, be, pinned, down, i, won, t, say, that, the, criterion, for, a, masterpiece, does, not, exist, but, i, don, t, know, what, it, is, she, claimed, to, enjoy, all, good, music, according, to, lennox, berkeley, a, good, waltz, has, just, as, much, value, to, her, as, a, good, fugue, and, this, is, because, she, judges, a, work, solely, on, its, aesthetic, content, she, was, an, admirer, of, debussy, and, a, disciple, of, ravel, although, she, bore, little, sympathy, for, schoenberg, and, the, viennese, dodecaphonicians, she, was, an, ardent, champion, of, stravinsky, she, insisted, on, complete, attention, at, all, times, anyone, who, acts, without, paying, attention, to, what, he, is, doing, is, wasting, his, life, i, d, go, so, far, as, to, say, that, life, is, denied, by, lack, of, attention, whether, it, be, to, cleaning, windows, or, trying, to, write, a, masterpiece, in, 1920, two, of, her, favourite, female, students, left, her, to, marry, she, thought, they, had, betrayed, their, work, with, her, and, their, obligation, to, music, her, attitude, to, women, in, music, was, contradictory, despite, lili, s, success, and, her, own, eminence, as, a, teacher, she, held, throughout, her, life, that, a, woman, s, duty, was, to, be, a, wife, and, mother, according, to, ned, rorem, she, would, always, give, the, benefit, of, the, doubt, to, her, male, students, while, overtaxing, the, females, she, saw, teaching, as, a, pleasure, a, privilege, and, a, duty, no, one, is, obliged, to, give, lessons, it, poisons, your, life, if, you, give, lessons, and, it, bores, you, boulanger, accepted, pupils, from, any, background, her, only, criterion, was, that, they, had, to, want, to, learn, she, treated, students, differently, depending, on, their, ability, her, talented, students, were, expected, to, answer, the, most, rigorous, questions, and, perform, well, under, stress, the, less, able, students, who, did, not, intend, to, follow, a, career, in, music, were, treated, more, leniently, and, michel, legrand, claimed, that, the, ones, she, disliked, were, graduated, with, a, first, prize, in, one, year, the, good, pupils, never, got, a, reward, so, they, stayed, i, was, for, seven, years, and, i, never, obtained, a,
