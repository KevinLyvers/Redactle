jean, baptiste, joseph, fourier, f, r, i, e, i, r, french, 21, march, 1768, 16, may, 1830, was, a, french, mathematician, and, physicist, born, in, auxerre, and, best, known, for, initiating, the, investigation, of, fourier, series, which, eventually, developed, into, fourier, analysis, and, harmonic, analysis, and, their, applications, to, problems, of, heat, transfer, and, vibrations, the, fourier, transform, and, fourier, s, law, of, conduction, are, also, named, in, his, honour, fourier, is, also, generally, credited, with, the, discovery, of, the, greenhouse, effect, fourier, was, born, in, auxerre, now, in, the, yonne, d, partement, of, france, the, son, of, a, tailor, he, was, orphaned, at, the, age, of, nine, fourier, was, recommended, to, the, bishop, of, auxerre, and, through, this, introduction, he, was, educated, by, the, benedictine, order, of, the, convent, of, st, mark, the, commissions, in, the, scientific, corps, of, the, army, were, reserved, for, those, of, good, birth, and, being, thus, ineligible, he, accepted, a, military, lectureship, on, mathematics, he, took, a, prominent, part, in, his, own, district, in, promoting, the, french, revolution, serving, on, the, local, revolutionary, committee, he, was, imprisoned, briefly, during, the, terror, but, in, 1795, was, appointed, to, the, cole, normale, and, subsequently, succeeded, joseph, louis, lagrange, at, the, cole, polytechnique, fourier, accompanied, napoleon, bonaparte, on, his, egyptian, expedition, in, 1798, as, scientific, adviser, and, was, appointed, secretary, of, the, institut, d, gypte, cut, off, from, france, by, the, british, fleet, he, organized, the, workshops, on, which, the, french, army, had, to, rely, for, their, munitions, of, war, he, also, contributed, several, mathematical, papers, to, the, egyptian, institute, also, called, the, cairo, institute, which, napoleon, founded, at, cairo, with, a, view, of, weakening, british, influence, in, the, east, after, the, british, victories, and, the, capitulation, of, the, french, under, general, menou, in, 1801, fourier, returned, to, france, in, 1801, napoleon, appointed, fourier, prefect, governor, of, the, department, of, is, re, in, grenoble, where, he, oversaw, road, construction, and, other, projects, however, fourier, had, previously, returned, home, from, the, napoleon, expedition, to, egypt, to, resume, his, academic, post, as, professor, at, cole, polytechnique, when, napoleon, decided, otherwise, in, his, remark, the, prefect, of, the, department, of, is, re, having, recently, died, i, would, like, to, express, my, confidence, in, citizen, fourier, by, appointing, him, to, this, place, hence, being, faithful, to, napoleon, he, took, the, office, of, prefect, it, was, while, at, grenoble, that, he, began, to, experiment, on, the, propagation, of, heat, he, presented, his, paper, on, the, propagation, of, heat, in, solid, bodies, to, the, paris, institute, on, 21, december, 1807, he, also, contributed, to, the, monumental, description, de, l, gypte, in, 1822, fourier, succeeded, jean, baptiste, joseph, delambre, as, permanent, secretary, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, 1830, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, fourier, never, married, in, 1830, his, diminished, health, began, to, take, its, toll, fourier, had, already, experienced, in, egypt, and, grenoble, some, attacks, of, aneurysm, of, the, heart, at, paris, it, was, impossible, to, be, mistaken, with, respect, to, the, primary, cause, of, the, frequent, suffocations, which, he, experienced, a, fall, however, which, he, sustained, on, the, 4th, of, may, 1830, while, descending, a, flight, of, stairs, aggravated, the, malady, to, an, extent, beyond, what, could, have, been, ever, feared, shortly, after, this, event, he, died, in, his, bed, on, 16, may, 1830, fourier, was, buried, in, the, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, in, paris, a, tomb, decorated, with, an, egyptian, motif, to, reflect, his, position, as, secretary, of, the, cairo, institute, and, his, collation, of, description, de, l, gypte, his, name, is, one, of, the, 72, names, inscribed, on, the, eiffel, tower, a, bronze, statue, was, erected, in, auxerre, in, 1849, but, it, was, melted, down, for, armaments, during, world, war, ii, joseph, fourier, university, in, grenoble, was, named, after, him, in, 1822, fourier, published, his, work, on, heat, flow, in, th, orie, analytique, de, la, chaleur, the, analytical, theory, of, heat, in, which, he, based, his, reasoning, on, newton, s, law, of, cooling, namely, that, the, flow, of, heat, between, two, adjacent, particles, is, proportional, to, the, extremely, small, difference, of, their, temperatures, this, book, was, translated, with, editorial, corrections, into, english, 56, years, later, by, freeman, 1878, the, book, was, also, edited, with, many, editorial, corrections, by, mathematician, jean, gaston, darboux, and, republished, in, french, in, 1888, there, were, three, important, contributions, in, this, work, one, purely, mathematical, two, essentially, physical, in, mathematics, fourier, claimed, that, any, function, of, a, variable, whether, continuous, or, discontinuous, can, be, expanded, in, a, series, of, sines, of, multiples, of, the, variable, though, this, result, is, not, correct, without, additional, conditions, fourier, s, observation, that, some, discontinuous, functions, are, the, sum, of, infinite, series, was, a, breakthrough, the, question, of, determining, when, a, fourier, series, converges, has, been, fundamental, for, centuries, joseph, louis, lagrange, had, given, particular, cases, of, this, false, theorem, and, had, implied, that, the, method, was, general, but, he, had, not, pursued, the, subject, peter, gustav, lejeune, dirichlet, was, the, first, to, give, a, satisfactory, demonstration, of, it, with, some, restrictive, conditions, this, work, provides, the, foundation, for, what, is, today, known, as, the, fourier, transform, one, important, physical, contribution, in, the, book, was, the, concept, of, dimensional, homogeneity, in, equations, i, e, an, equation, can, be, formally, correct, only, if, the, dimensions, match, on, either, side, of, the, equality, fourier, made, important, contributions, to, dimensional, analysis, the, other, physical, contribution, was, fourier, s, proposal, of, his, partial, differential, equation, for, conductive, diffusion, of, heat, this, equation, is, now, taught, to, every, student, of, mathematical, physics, fourier, left, an, unfinished, work, on, determining, and, locating, real, roots, of, polynomials, which, was, edited, by, claude, louis, navier, and, published, in, 1831, this, work, contains, much, original, matter, in, particular, fourier, s, theorem, on, polynomial, real, roots, published, in, 1820, fourier, s, theorem, on, real, roots, of, polynomials, states, that, a, polynomial, with, real, coefficients, has, a, real, root, between, any, two, consecutive, zeros, of, its, derivative, fran, ois, budan, in, 1807, and, 1811, had, published, independently, his, theorem, also, known, by, the, name, of, fourier, which, is, very, close, to, fourier, s, theorem, each, theorem, is, a, corollary, of, the, other, fourier, s, proof, is, the, one, that, was, usually, given, during, 19th, century, in, textbooks, on, the, theory, of, equations, a, complete, solution, of, the, problem, was, given, in, 1829, by, jacques, charles, fran, ois, sturm, in, the, 1820s, fourier, calculated, that, an, object, the, size, of, the, earth, and, at, its, distance, from, the, sun, should, be, considerably, colder, than, the, planet, actually, is, if, warmed, by, only, the, effects, of, incoming, solar, radiation, he, examined, various, possible, sources, of, the, additional, observed, heat, in, articles, published, in, 1824, and, 1827, however, in, the, end, because, of, the, large, 33, degree, difference, between, his, calculations, and, observations, fourier, mistakenly, believed, that, there, is, a, significant, contribution, of, radiation, from, interstellar, space, still, fourier, s, consideration, of, the, possibility, that, the, earth, s, atmosphere, might, act, as, an, insulator, of, some, kind, is, widely, recognized, as, the, first, proposal, of, what, is, now, known, as, the, greenhouse, effect, although, fourier, never, called, it, that, in, his, articles, fourier, referred, to, an, experiment, by, horace, b, n, dict, de, saussure, who, lined, a, vase, with, blackened, cork, into, the, cork, he, inserted, several, panes, of, transparent, glass, separated, by, intervals, of, air, midday, sunlight, was, allowed, to, enter, at, the, top, of, the, vase, through, the, glass, panes, the, temperature, became, more, elevated, in, the, more, interior, compartments, of, this, device, fourier, noted, that, if, gases, in, the, atmosphere, could, form, a, stable, barrier, like, the, glass, panes, they, would, have, a, similar, effect, on, planetary, temperatures, this, conclusion, may, have, contributed, to, the, later, use, of, the, metaphor, of, the, greenhouse, effect, to, refer, to, the, processes, that, determine, atmospheric, temperatures, fourier, noted, that, the, actual, mechanisms, that, determine, the, temperatures, of, the, atmosphere, included, convection, which, was, not, present, in, de, saussure, s, experimental, device
