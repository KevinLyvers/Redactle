in, both, his, public, speeches, and, personal, diary, however, like, many, americans, before, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, he, opposed, not, only, the, military, intervention, of, the, u, s, but,

to, you, after, a, war, lindbergh, s, mother, was, a, chemistry, teacher, at, cass, technical, high, school, in, detroit, and, later, at, little, falls, high, school, from, which, her, son, graduated, on, june, 5, 1918, lindbergh, attended, more, than, a, dozen, other, schools, from, washington, d, c, to, california, during, his, childhood, and, teenage, years, none, for, more, than, a, year, or, two, including, the, force, school, and, sidwell, friends, school, while, living, in, washington, with, his, father, and, redondo, union, high, school, in, redondo, beach, california, while, living, there, with, his, mother, although, he, enrolled, in, the, college, of, engineering, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, in, late, 1920, lindbergh, dropped, out, in, the, middle, of, his, sophomore, year, and, then, went, to, lincoln, nebraska, in, march, 1922, to, begin, flight, training, from, an, early, age, lindbergh, had, exhibited, an, interest, in, the, mechanics, of, motorized, transportation, including, his, family, s, saxon, six, automobile, and, later, his, excelsior, motorbike, by, the, time, that, he, started, college, as, a, mechanical, engineering, student, he, had, also, become, fascinated, with, flying, though, he, had, never, been, close, enough, to, a, plane, to, touch, it, after, quitting, college, in, february, 1922, lindbergh, enrolled, at, the, nebraska, aircraft, corporation, s, flying, school, in, lincoln, and, flew, for, the, first, time, on, april, 9, as, a, passenger, in, a, two, seat, lincoln, standard, tourabout, biplane, trainer, piloted, by, otto, timm, a, few, days, later, lindbergh, took, his, first, formal, flying, lesson, in, that, same, aircraft, though, he, was, never, permitted, to, solo, because, he, could, not, afford, to, post, the, requisite, damage, bond, to, gain, flight, experience, and, earn, money, for, further, instruction, lindbergh, left, lincoln, in, june, to, spend, the, next, few, months, barnstorming, across, nebraska, kansas, colorado, wyoming, and, montana, as, a, wing, walker, and, parachutist, he, also, briefly, worked, as, an, airplane, mechanic, at, the, billings, montana, municipal, airport, lindbergh, left, flying, with, the, onset, of, winter, and, returned, to, his, father, s, home, in, minnesota, his, return, to, the, air, and, his, first, solo, flight, did, not, come, until, half, a, year, later, in, may, 1923, at, souther, field, in, americus, georgia, a, former, army, flight, training, field, where, he, bought, a, world, war, i, surplus, curtiss, jn, 4, jenny, biplane, though, lindbergh, had, not, touched, an, airplane, in, more, than, six, months, he, had, already, secretly, decided, that, he, was, ready, to, take, to, the, air, by, himself, after, a, half, hour, of, dual, time, with, a, pilot, who, was, visiting, the, field, to, pick, up, another, surplus, jn, 4, lindbergh, flew, solo, for, the, first, time, in, the, jenny, that, he, had, just, purchased, for, 500, after, spending, another, week, or, so, at, the, field, to, practice, thereby, acquiring, five, hours, of, pilot, in, command, time, lindbergh, took, off, from, americus, for, montgomery, alabama, some, 140, miles, 230, km, to, the, west, for, his, first, solo, cross, country, flight, he, went, on, to, spend, much, of, the, remainder, of, 1923, engaged, in, almost, nonstop, barnstorming, under, the, name, of, daredevil, lindbergh, unlike, in, the, previous, year, this, time, lindbergh, flew, in, his, own, ship, as, the, pilot, a, few, weeks, after, leaving, americus, he, achieved, another, key, aviation, milestone, when, he, made, his, first, night, flight, near, lake, village, arkansas, while, lindbergh, was, barnstorming, in, lone, rock, wisconsin, on, two, occasions, he, flew, a, local, physician, across, the, wisconsin, river, to, emergency, calls, that, were, otherwise, unreachable, because, of, flooding, he, broke, his, propeller, several, times, while, landing, and, on, june, 3, 1923, he, was, grounded, for, a, week, when, he, ran, into, a, ditch, in, glencoe, minnesota, while, flying, his, father, then, running, for, the, u, s, senate, to, a, campaign, stop, in, october, lindbergh, flew, his, jenny, to, iowa, where, he, sold, it, to, a, flying, student, after, selling, the, jenny, lindbergh, returned, to, lincoln, by, train, there, he, joined, leon, klink, and, continued, to, barnstorm, through, the, south, for, the, next, few, months, in, klink, s, curtiss, jn, 4c, canuck, the, canadian, version, of, the, jenny, lindbergh, also, cracked, up, this, aircraft, once, when, his, engine, failed, shortly, after, takeoff, in, pensacola, florida, but, again, he, managed, to, repair, the, damage, himself, following, a, few, months, of, barnstorming, through, the, south, the, two, pilots, parted, company, in, san, antonio, texas, where, lindbergh, reported, to, brooks, field, on, march, 19, 1924, to, begin, a, year, of, military, flight, training, with, the, united, states, army, air, service, there, and, later, at, nearby, kelly, field, lindbergh, had, his, most, serious, flying, accident, on, march, 5, 1925, eight, days, before, graduation, when, a, mid, air, collision, with, another, army, s, e, 5, during, aerial, combat, maneuvers, forced, him, to, bail, out, only, 18, of, the, 104, cadets, who, started, flight, training, a, year, earlier, remained, when, lindbergh, graduated, first, overall, in, his, class, in, march, 1925, thereby, earning, his, army, pilot, s, wings, and, a, commission, as, a, second, lieutenant, in, the, air, service, reserve, corps, lindbergh, later, said, that, this, year, was, critical, to, his, development, as, both, a, focused, goal, oriented, individual, and, as, an, aviator, the, army, did, not, need, additional, active, duty, pilots, however, so, immediately, following, graduation, lindbergh, returned, to, civilian, aviation, as, a, barnstormer, and, flight, instructor, although, as, a, reserve, officer, he, also, continued, to, do, some, part, time, military, flying, by, joining, the, 110th, observation, squadron, 35th, division, missouri, national, guard, in, st, louis, he, was, promoted, to, first, lieutenant, on, december, 7, 1925, and, to, captain, in, july, 1926, in, october, 1925, lindbergh, was, hired, by, the, robertson, aircraft, corporation, rac, at, the, lambert, st, louis, flying, field, in, anglum, missouri, where, he, had, been, working, as, a, flight, instructor, to, first, lay, out, and, then, serve, as, chief, pilot, for, the, newly, designated, 278, mile, 447, km, contract, air, mail, route, 2, cam, 2, to, provide, service, between, st, louis, and, chicago, maywood, field, with, two, intermediate, stops, in, springfield, and, peoria, illinois, lindbergh, and, three, other, rac, pilots, philip, r, love, thomas, p, nelson, and, harlan, a, bud, gurney, flew, the, mail, over, cam, 2, in, a, fleet, of, four, modified, war, surplus, de, havilland, dh, 4, biplanes, just, before, signing, on, to, fly, with, cam, lindbergh, had, applied, to, serve, as, a, pilot, on, richard, e, byrd, s, north, pole, expedition, but, apparently, his, bid, came, too, late, on, april, 13, 1926, lindbergh, executed, the, united, states, post, office, department, s, oath, of, mail, messengers, and, two, days, later, he, opened, service, on, the, new, route, on, two, occasions, combinations, of, bad, weather, equipment, failure, and, fuel, exhaustion, forced, him, to, bail, out, on, night, approach, to, chicago, both, times, he, reached, the, ground, without, serious, injury, and, immediately, set, about, ensuring, that, his, cargo, was, located, and, sent, on, with, minimum, delay, in, mid, february, 1927, he, left, for, san, diego, california, to, oversee, design, and, construction, of, the, spirit, of, st, louis, in, 1919, british, aviators, john, alcock, and, arthur, brown, won, the, daily, mail, prize, for, the, first, nonstop, transatlantic, flight, their, aircraft, was, a, vickers, vimy, iv, biplane, designed, for, service, in, ww1, alcock, and, brown, left, st, john, s, newfoundland, on, june, 14, 1919, and, arrived, in, clifden, county, galway, ireland, the, following, day, around, the, same, time, french, born, new, york, hotelier, raymond, orteig, was, approached, by, augustus, post, secretary, of, the, aero, club, of, america, and, prompted, to, put, up, a, 25, 000, about, 421, 977, in, 2024, award, for, the, first, successful, nonstop, transatlantic, flight, specifically, between, new, york, city, and, paris, in, either, direction, within, five, years, after, its, establishment, when, that, time, limit, lapsed, in, 1924, without, a, serious, attempt, orteig, renewed, the, offer, for, another, five, years, this, time, attracting, a, number, of, well, known, highly, experienced, and, well, financed, contenders, none, of, whom, was, successful, on, september, 21, 1926, world, war, i, french, flying, ace, ren, fonck, s, sikorsky, s, 35, crashed, on, takeoff, from, roosevelt, field, in, new, york, u, s, naval, aviators, noel, davis, and, stanton, h, wooster, were, killed, at,

airport, in, the, levasseur, pl, 8, seaplane, l, oiseau, blanc, they, disappeared, somewhere, in, the, atlantic, after, last, being, seen, crossing, the, west, coast, of, ireland, american, air, racer, clarence, d, chamberlin, and, arctic, explorer, richard, e, byrd, were, also, in, the, race, financing, the, operation, of, the, historic, flight, was, a, challenge, due, to, lindbergh, s, obscurity, but, two, st, louis, businessmen, eventually, obtained, a, 15, 000, bank, loan, lindbergh, contributed, 2, 000, 33, 536, in, 2023, of, his, own, money, from, his, salary, as, an, air, mail, pilot, and, another, 1, 000, was, donated, by, rac, the, total, of, 18, 000, was, far, less, than, what, was, available, to, lindbergh, s, rivals, the, group, tried, to, buy, an, off, the, peg, single, or, multiengine, monoplane, from, wright, aeronautical, then, travel, air, and, finally, the, newly, formed, columbia, aircraft, corporation, but, all, insisted, on, selecting, the, pilot, as, a, condition, of, sale, finally, the, much, smaller, ryan, aircraft, company, of, san, diego, agreed, to, design, and, build, a, custom, monoplane, for, 10, 580, and, on, february, 25, a, deal, was, formally, closed, dubbed, the, spirit, of, st, louis, the, fabric, covered, single, seat, single, engine, ryan, nyp, for, new, york, paris, high, wing, monoplane, cab, registration, n, x, 211, was, designed, jointly, by, lindbergh, and, ryan, s, chief, engineer, donald, a, hall, the, spirit, flew, for, the, first, time, just, two, months, later, and, after, a, series, of, test, flights, lindbergh, took, off, from, san, diego, on, may, 10, he, went, first, to, st, louis, then, on, to, roosevelt, field, on, new, york, s, long, island, in, the, early, morning, of, friday, may, 20, 1927, lindbergh, took, off, from, roosevelt, field, on, long, island, his, destination, le, bourget, aerodrome, was, about, 7, miles, 11, km, outside, paris, and, 3, 610, miles, 5, 810, km, from, his, starting, point, he, was, too, busy, the, night, before, to, lie, down, for, more, than, a, couple, of, hours, and, had, been, unable, sleep, it, rained, the, morning, of, his, takeoff, but, as, the, plane, was, wheeled, into, position, on, the, runway, the, rain, ceased, and, light, began, to, break, through, the, low, hanging, clouds, a, crowd, variously, described, as, nearly, a, thousand, or, several, thousand, assembled, to, see, lindbergh, off, and, he, walked, around, the, plane, on, a, final, tour, of, inspection, after, stepping, from, a, closed, car, where, he, had, waited, for, its, transatlantic, flight, the, spirit, was, loaded, with, 450, u, s, gallons, 1, 700, liters, of, fuel, that, was, filtered, repeatedly, to, avoid, fuel, line, blockage, the, fuel, load, was, a, thousand, pounds, heavier, than, any, the, spirit, had, lifted, during, a, test, flight, and, the, fully, loaded, airplane, weighed, 5, 200, pounds, 2, 400, kg, or, 2, 7, short, tons, 2, 400, kg, with, takeoff, hampered, by, a, muddy, rain, soaked, runway, the, plane, was, helped, by, men, pushing, at, the, wing, struts, with, the, last, man, leaving, the, wings, only, one, hundred, yards, 91, m, down, the, runway, lindbergh, s, monoplane, was, powered, by, a, j, 5c, wright, whirlwind, radial, engine, and, gained, speed, very, slowly, during, its, 7, 52, am, takeoff, but, cleared, telephone, lines, at, the, far, end, of, the, field, by, about, twenty, feet, six, point, one, metres, with, a, fair, reserve, of, flying, speed, at, 8, 52, am, an, hour, after, takeoff, lindbergh, was, flying, at, an, altitude, of, 500, feet, 150, m, over, rhode, island, following, an, uneventful, passage, aside, from, some, turbulence, over, long, island, sound, and, connecticut, by, 9, 52, am, he, had, passed, boston, and, was, flying, with, cape, cod, to, his, right, with, an, airspeed, of, 107, miles, per, hour, 172, km, h, and, altitude, of, 150, feet, 46, m, about, an, hour, later, he, began, to, feel, tired, even, though, only, a, few, hours, had, elapsed, since, takeoff, to, keep, his, mind, clear, lindbergh, descended, and, flew, at, only, 10, feet, 3, 0, m, above, the, water, s, surface, by, around, 11, 52, am, he, had, climbed, to, an, altitude, of, 200, feet, 61, m, and, at, this, point, was, 400, miles, 640, km, distant, from, new, york, nova, scotia, appeared, ahead, and, after, flying, over, the, gulf, of, maine, he, was, only, 6, miles, 9, 7, km, or, 2, degrees, off, course, at, 3, 52, pm, the, eastern, coast, of, cape, breton, island, was, below, he, struggled, to, stay, awake, even, though, it, was, only, the, afternoon, of, the, first, day, at, 5, 52, pm, he, was, flying, along, the, newfoundland, coast, and, passed, st, john, s, at, 7, 15, pm, on, its, may, 21, front, page, the, new, york, times, ran, a, special, cable, from, the, prior, evening, captain, lindbergh, s, airplane, passed, over, st, john, s, at, 8, 15, o, clock, tonight, was, seen, by, hundreds, and, disappeared, seaward, heading, for, ireland, it, was, flying, quite, low, between, the, hills, near, st, john, s, the, times, also, observed, that, lindbergh, was, following, the, track, of, hawker, and, greeve, and, also, of, alcock, and, brown, on, the, first, transatlantic, flight, eight, years, ago, stars, appeared, as, night, fell, around, 8, pm, the, sea, became, totally, obscured, by, fog, prompting, lindbergh, to, climb, from, an, altitude, of, 800, feet, 240, m, to, 7, 500, feet, 2, 300, m, to, stay, above, the, quickly, rising, cloud, an, hour, later, he, was, flying, at, 10, 000, feet, 3, 000, m, a, towering, thunderhead, stood, in, front, of, him, and, he, flew, into, the, cloud, but, turned, back, after, he, noticed, ice, forming, on, the, plane, while, inside, the, cloud, lindbergh, thrust, a, bare, hand, through, the, cockpit, window, and, felt, the, sting, of, ice, particles, after, returning, to, open, sky, he, curved, back, to, his, course, at, 11, 52, pm, lindbergh, was, in, warmer, air, and, no, ice, remained, on, the, spirit, he, was, flying, 90, miles, per, hour, 140, km, h, at, 10, 000, feet, 3, 000, m, and, was, 500, miles, 800, km, from, newfoundland, eighteen, hours, into, the, flight, he, was, halfway, to, paris, and, while, he, had, planned, to, celebrate, at, this, point, he, instead, felt, only, dread, because, lindbergh, flew, through, several, time, zones, dawn, came, earlier, at, around, 2, 52, am, he, began, to, hallucinate, about, two, hours, later, at, this, point, in, the, flight, he, continually, fell, asleep, awakening, seconds, possibly, minutes, later, but, after, flying, for, hours, in, or, above, the, fog, the, weather, finally, began, to, clear, 7, 52, am, marked, twenty, four, hours, in, the, air, for, lindbergh, and, fortunately, he, did, not, feel, as, tired, by, this, point, finally, at, around, 9, 52, am, new, york, time, or, twenty, seven, hours, after, he, left, roosevelt, field, lindbergh, saw, porpoises, and, fishing, boats, a, sign, he, had, reached, the, other, side, of, the, atlantic, he, circled, and, flew, closely, but, no, fishermen, appeared, on, the, boat, decks, although, he, did, see, a, face, watching, from, a, porthole, dingle, bay, in, county, kerry, of, southwest, ireland, was, the, first, european, land, that, lindbergh, encountered, he, veered, to, get, a, better, look, and, consulted, his, charts, identifying, it, as, the, southern, tip, of, ireland, the, local, time, in, ireland, was, 3, pm, flying, over, dingle, bay, the, spirit, was, 2, 5, hours, ahead, of, schedule, and, less, than, 3, miles, 4, 8, km, off, course, lindbergh, had, navigated, almost, precisely, to, the, coastal, point, he, had, marked, on, his, chart, he, wanted, to,

came, from, plymouth, on, the, english, coast, that, lindbergh, s, plane, had, started, across, the, english, channel, news, soon, spread, across, both, europe, and, the, united, states, that, lindbergh, had, been, spotted, over, england, and, a, crowd, started, to, form, at, le, bourget, aerodrome, as, he, neared, paris, at, sunset, he, flew, over, cherbourg, on, the, french, coast, 200, miles, 320, km, from, paris, it, was, around, 2, 52, pm, new, york, time, over, the, 33, 1, 2, hours, of, his, flight, lindbergh, faced, many, challenges, which, included, skimming, over, storm, clouds, at, 10, 000, ft, 3, 000, m, and, wave, tops, at, as, low, as, 10, ft, 3, 0, m, the, aircraft, fought, icing, flew, blind, through, fog, for, several, hours, and, lindbergh, navigated, only, by, dead, reckoning, he, was, not, proficient, at, navigating, by, the, sun, and, stars, and, he, rejected, radio, navigation, gear, as, heavy, and, unreliable, he, was, fortunate, that, the, winds, over, the, atlantic, cancelled, each, other, out, giving, him, zero, wind, drift, and, thus, accurate, navigation, during, the, long, flight, over, featureless, ocean, on, arriving, at, paris, lindbergh, circled, the, eiffel, tower, before, flying, to, the, airfield, he, flew, over, the, crowd, at, le, bourget, aerodrome, at, 10, 16, and, landed, at, 10, 22, pm, on, saturday, may, 21, on, the, far, side, of, the, field, and, nearly, half, a, mile, from, the, crowd, as, reported, by, the, new, york, times, the, airfield, was, not, marked, on, his, map, and, lindbergh, knew, only, that, it, was, some, seven, miles, northeast, of, the, city, he, initially, mistook, it, for, some, large, industrial, complex, because, of, the, bright, lights, spreading, out, in, all, directions, in, fact, the, headlights, of, tens, of, thousands, of, spectators, cars, caught, in, the, largest, traffic, jam, in, paris, history, in, their, attempt, to, be, present, for, lindbergh, s, landing, a, crowd, estimated, at, 150, 000, stormed, the, field, dragged, lindbergh, out, of, the, cockpit, and, carried, him, around, above, their, heads, for, nearly, half, an, hour, among, the, crowd, were, two, future, indian, prime, ministers, jawaharlal, nehru, and, his, daughter, indira, gandhi, some, minor, damage, was, done, to, the, spirit, especially, to, the, fine, linen, silver, painted, fabric, covering, on, the, fuselage, by, souvenir, hunters, before, pilot, and, plane, reached, the, safety, of, a, nearby, hangar, with, the, aid, of, french, military, fliers, soldiers, and, police, the, times, reported, that, before, the, police, could, intervene, the, souvenir, mad, spectators, stripped, the, plane, of, everything, which, could, be, taken, off, and, were, cutting, off, pieces, of, linen, when, a, squad, of, soldiers, with, fixed, bayonets, quickly, surrounded, the, plane, providing, guard, as, it, was, wheeled, into, a, shed, lindbergh, met, the, u, s, ambassador, to, france, myron, t, herrick, across, le, bourget, field, in, a, little, room, with, a, few, chairs, and, an, army, cot, the, lights, in, the, room, were, turned, off, to, conceal, his, presence, from, the, frenzied, crowd, which, surged, madly, trying, to, find, him, lindbergh, shook, hands, with, herrick, and, handed, him, several, letters, he, had, carried, across, the, atlantic, three, of, which, were, from, col, theodore, roosevelt, jr, son, of, former, president, theodore, roosevelt, who, had, written, letters, of, introduction, at, lindbergh, s, request, lindbergh, left, the, airfield, around, midnight, and, was, driven, through, paris, to, the, ambassador, s, residence, stopping, to, visit, the, french, tomb, of, the, unknown, soldier, at, the, arc, de, triomphe, after, arriving, at, the, residence, he, slept, for, the, first, time, in, about, 60, hours, lindbergh, s, flight, was, certified, by, the, national, aeronautic, association, of, the, united, states, based,

able, to, see, europe, the, morning, after, landing, lindbergh, appeared, in, the, balcony, of, the, u, s, embassy, responding, briefly, and, modestly, to, the, calls, of, the, crowd, the, french,

then, went, to, place, a, wreath, on, the, belgian, tomb, of, the, unknown, soldier, he, then, visited, the, belgian, royal, palace, at, the, invitation, of, king, albert, i, where, the, king, made, lindbergh, a, knight, of, the, order, of, leopold, as, lindbergh, shook, the, king, s, hand, he, said, i, have, heard, much, of, the, famous, soldier, king, of, the, belgians, the, united, press, reported, that, one, million, persons, are, in, brussels, today, to, greet, lindbergh, constituting, the, greatest, welcome, ever, accorded, a, private, citizen, in, belgium, after, belgium,

reaching, the, airfield, he, overflew, london, where, crowds, some, on, roofs, gazed, at, the, flyer, and, observers, with, field, glasses, in, the, west, end, business, district, watched, him, about,

later, had, they, cleared, a, space, large, enough, for, him, to, land, police, reserves, were, sent, to, the, airfield, in, large, numbers, but, it, was, not, enough, to, contain, the, multitude, as, the, plane, came, to, a, stop, the, crowd, waved, american, flags, smashed, fences, and, knocked, down, police, while, lindbergh, himself, was, described, as, grinning, and, serene, amid, the, seething, crowd, the, united, press, reported, that, a, man, s, leg, was, broken, in, the, crush, and, another, man, fell, from, atop, a, hangar, and, suffered, internal, injuries, english, officials, were, reportedly, surprised, by, the, enthusiasm, of, the, welcome, a, limousine, pulled, near, the, spirit, escorting, lindbergh, to, a, tower, on, the, field, where, he, responded, to, the, cheering, crowd, all, i, can, say, is, that, this, is, worse, than, what, happened, at, le, bourget, field, he, told, them, but, all, the, same, i, m, glad, to, be, here, when, he, reached, the, reception, room, where, british, secretary, of, state, for, air, sir, samuel, hoare, u, s, ambassador, alanson, b, houghton, and, others, waited, his, first, words, were, save, my, plane, mechanics,

s, visit, to, the, palace, a, crowd, massed, hoping, to, get, a, glimpse, of, him, the, crowd, became, so, great, that, police, had, to, call, in, reserves, from, scotland, yard, upon, his, arrival, back, in, the, united, states, aboard, the, u, s, navy, cruiser, uss, memphis, cl, 13, on, june, 11, 1927, a, fleet, of, warships, and, multiple, flights, of, military, aircraft, escorted, him, up, the, potomac, river, to, the, washington, navy, yard, where, president, calvin, coolidge, awarded, him, the, distinguished, flying, cross, lindbergh, received, the, first, award, of, this, medal, but, it, violated, the, authorizing, regulation, coolidge, s, own, executive, order, published, in, march, 1927, required, recipients, to, perform, their, feats, of, airmanship, while, participating, in, an, aerial, flight, as, part, of, the, duties, incident, to, such, membership, which, lindbergh, very, clearly, failed, to, satisfy, the, u, s, post, office, department, issued, a, 10, cent, air, mail, stamp, scott, c, 10, depicting, the, spirit, and, a, map, of, the, flight, lindbergh, flew, from, washington, d, c, to, new, york, city, on, june, 13, arriving, in, lower, manhattan, he,

another, ceremony, hosted, by, new, york, governor, al, smith, and, attended, by, a, crowd, of, 200, 000, some, 4, 000, 000, people, saw, lindbergh, that, day, at, central, park, governor, smith, awarded, him, the, new, york, medal, for, valor, that, evening, lindbergh, was, accompanied, by, his, mother, and, mayor, walker, when, he, was, the, guest, of, honor, at, a, 500, guest, banquet, and, dance, held, at, clarence, mackay, s, long, island, estate, harbor, hill, the, following, night, lindbergh, was, honored, with, a, grand, banquet, at, the, hotel, commodore, given, by, the, mayor, s,

lindbergh, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, colonel, in, the, air, corps, of, the, officers, reserve, corps, of, the, u, s, army, on, december, 14, 1927, a, special, act, of, congress, awarded, lindbergh, the, medal, of, honor, despite, the, fact, that, it, was, almost, always, awarded, for, heroism, in, combat, it, was, presented, to, lindbergh, by, president, coolidge, at, the, white, house, on, march, 21, 1928, curiously, the, medal, contradicted, coolidge, s, earlier, executive, order, directing, that, not, more, than, one, of, the, several, decorations, authorized, by, federal, law, will, be, awarded, for, the, same, act, of, heroism, or, extraordinary, achievement, lindbergh, was, recognized, for, the, same, act, with, both, the, medal, of, honor, and, the, distinguished, flying, cross, the, statute, authorizing, the, award, was, also, criticized, for, apparently, violating, procedure, house, legislators, reportedly, neglected, to, have, their, votes, counted, similar, noncombat, awards, of, the, medal, of, honor, were, also, authorized, by, special, statutes, and, awarded, to, naval, aviators, richard, e, byrd, and, floyd, bennett, as, well, as, arctic, explorer, adolphus, w, greely, in, addition, the, medal, of, honor, awarded, to, general, douglas, macarthur, was, reportedly, based, on, the, lindbergh, precedent, although, macarthur, notably, lacked, implementing, legislation, which, probably, rendered, his, award, unlawful, lindbergh, was, honored, as, the, first, time, magazine, man, of, the, year, now, called, person, of, the, year, when, he, appeared, on, that, magazine, s, cover, at, age, 25, on, january, 2, 1928, he, remained, the, youngest, time, person, of, the, year, until, greta, thunberg, surpassed, his, record, in, 2019, the, winner, of, the, 1930, best, woman, aviator, of, the, year, award, elinor, smith, sullivan, said, that, before, lindbergh, s, flight, people, seemed, to, think, we, were, from, outer, space, or, something, but, after, charles, lindbergh, s, flight, we, could, do, no, wrong, it, s, hard, to, describe, the, impact, lindbergh, had, on, people, even, the, first, walk, on, the, moon, doesn, t, come, close, the, twenties, was, such, an, innocent, time, and, people, were, still, so, religious, i, think, they, felt, like, this, man, was, sent, by, god, to, do, this, and, it, changed, aviation, forever, because, all, of, a, sudden, the, wall, streeters, were, banging, on, doors, looking, for, airplanes, to, invest, in, we, d, been, standing, on, our, heads, trying, to, get, them, to, notice, us, but, after, lindbergh, suddenly, everyone, wanted, to, fly, and, there, weren, t, enough, planes, to, carry, them, barely, two, months, after, lindbergh, arrived, in, paris, g, p, putnam, s, sons, published, his, 318, page, autobiography, we, which, was, the, first, of, 15, books, he, eventually, wrote, or, to, which, he, made, significant, contributions, the, company, was, run, by, aviation, enthusiast, george, p, putnam, the, dustjacket, notes, said, that, lindbergh, wanted, to, share, the, story, of, his, life, and, his, transatlantic, flight, together, with, his, views, on, the, future, of, aviation, and, that, we, referred, to, the, spiritual, partnership, that, had, developed, between, himself, and, his, airplane, during, the, dark, hours, of, his, flight, however, as, berg, wrote, in, 1998, putnam, s, chose, the, title, without, lindbergh, s, knowledge, or, approval, and, lindbergh, would, forever, complain, about, it, that, his, use, of, we, meant, him, and, his, backers, not, him, and, his, plane, as, the, press, had, people, believing, nonetheless, as, berg, remarked, his, frequent, unconscious, use, of, the, phrase, suggested, otherwise, putnam, s, sold, special, autographed, copies, of, the, book, for, 25, each, all, of, which, were, purchased, before, publication, we, was, soon, translated, into, most, major, languages, and, sold, more, than, 650, 000, copies, in, the, first, year, earning, lindbergh, more, than, 250, 000, its, success, was, considerably, aided, by, lindbergh, s, three, month, 22, 350, mile, 35, 970, km, tour, of, the, united, states, in, the, spirit, on, behalf, of, the, daniel, guggenheim, fund, for, the, promotion, of, aeronautics, between, july, 20, and, october, 23, 1927, lindbergh, visited, 82, cities, in, all, 48,

and, february, 8, 1928, dubbed, the, good, will, tour, it, included, stops, in, mexico, where, he, also, met, his, future, wife, anne, the, daughter, of, u, s, ambassador, dwight, morrow, guatemala, british, honduras, el, salvador, honduras, nicaragua, costa, rica, panama, the, canal, zone, colombia, venezuela, st, thomas, puerto, rico, the, dominican, republic, haiti, and, cuba, covering, 9, 390, miles, 15, 110, km, in, just, over, 116, hours, of, flight, time, a, year, and, two, days, after, it, had, made, its, first, flight, lindbergh, flew, the, spirit, from, st, louis, to, washington, d, c, where, it, has, been, on, public, display, at, the, smithsonian, institution, ever, since, over, the, previous, 367, days, lindbergh, and, the, spirit, had, logged, 489, hours, 28, minutes, of, flight, time, together, a, lindbergh, boom, in, aviation, had, begun, the, volume, of, mail, moving, by, air, increased, 50, percent, within, six, months, applications, for, pilots, licenses, tripled, and, the, number, of, planes, quadrupled, 17, president, herbert, hoover, appointed, lindbergh, to, the, national, advisory, committee, for, aeronautics, lindbergh, and, pan, american, world, airways, head, juan, trippe, were, interested, in, developing, an, air, route, across, alaska, and, siberia, to, china, and, japan, in, the, summer, of, 1931, with, trippe, s, support, lindbergh, and, his, wife, flew, from, long, island, to, nome, alaska, and, from, there, to, siberia, japan, and, china, the, flight, was, carried, out, with, a, lockheed, model, 8, sirius, named, tingmissartoq, the, route, was, not, available, for, commercial, service, until, after, world, war, ii, as, prewar, aircraft, lacked, the, range, to, fly, alaska, to, japan, nonstop, and, the, united, states, had, not, officially, recognized, the, soviet, government, in, china, they, volunteered, to, help, in, disaster, investigation, and, relief, efforts, for, the, central, china, flood, of, 1931, this, was, later, documented, in, anne, s, book, north, to, the, orient, lindbergh, used, his, world, fame, to, promote, air, mail, service, for, example, at, the, request, of, basil, l, rowe, the, owner, of, west, indian, aerial, express, and, later, pan, am, s, chief, pilot, in, february, 1928, he, carried, some, 3, 000, pieces, of, special, souvenir, mail, between, santo, domingo, r, d, port, au, prince,

1927, and, february, 8, 1928, and, the, only, franked, mail, pieces, that, he, ever, flew, in, his, iconic, plane, two, weeks, after, his, latin, american, tour, lindbergh, piloted, a, series, of, special, flights, over, his, old, cam, 2, route, on, february, 20, and, february, 21, tens, of, thousands, of, self, addressed, souvenir, covers, were, sent, in, from, all, over, the, world, so, at, each, stop, lindbergh, switched, to, another, of, the, three, planes, he, and, his, fellow, cam, 2, pilots, had, used, so, it, could, be, said, that, each, cover, had, been, flown, by, him, the, covers, were, then, backstamped, and, returned, to, their, senders, as, a, promotion, of, the, air, mail, service, in, 1929, 1931, lindbergh, carried, much, smaller, numbers, of, souvenir, covers, on, the, first, flights, over, routes, in, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, which, he, had, earlier, laid, out, as, a, consultant, to, pan, american, airways, to, be, then, flown, under, contract, to,

philatelic, world, as, the, covers, of, the, lost, mail, flight, the, historic, flight, was, received, with, much, notoriety, in, the, press, and, marked, the, beginning, of, extended, airmail, service, between, the, united, states, and, mexico, in, his, autobiography, lindbergh, derided, pilots, he, met, as, womanizing, barnstormers, he, also, criticized, army, cadets, for, their, facile,

were, soon, to, be, withdrawn, from, circulation, and, would, therefore, attract, attention, the, bills, serial, numbers, were, also, recorded, on, may, 12, the, child, s, remains, were, found, in, woods, not, far, from, the, lindbergh, home, the, case, was, widely, called, the, crime, of, the, century, and, was, described, by, h, l, mencken, as, the, biggest, story, since, the, resurrection, in, response, congress, passed, the, so, called, lindbergh, law, which, made, kidnapping, a, federal, offense, if, the, victim, is, taken, across, state, lines, or, as, in, the, lindbergh, case, the, kidnapper, uses, the, mail, or, interstate, or, foreign, commerce, in, committing, or, in, furtherance, of, the, commission, of, the, offense, such, as, in, demanding, ransom, richard, hauptmann, a, 34, year, old, german, immigrant, carpenter, was, arrested, near, his, home, in, the, bronx, new, york, on, september, 19, 1934, after, paying, for, gasoline, with, one, of, the, ransom, bills, 13,

atmosphere, in, flemington, new, jersey, he, was, convicted, on, february, 13, sentenced, to, death, and, electrocuted, at, trenton, state, prison, on, april, 3, 1936, relatives, of, hauptmann, have, contested, his, guilt, and, as, of, 2024, there, is, an, ongoing, push, for, dna, testing, which, some, scholars, and, legal, activists, contend, may, exonerate, him, an, intensely, private, man, lindbergh, became, exasperated, by, the, unrelenting, public, attention, in, the, wake, of, the, kidnapping, and, hauptmann, trial, and, was, concerned, for, the, safety, of, his, three, year, old, second, son, jon, consequently, in, the, predawn, hours, of, sunday, december, 22, 1935, the, family, sailed, furtively, from, manhattan, for, liverpool, the, only, three, passengers, aboard, the,

treasury, secretary, ogden, l, mills, news, of, the, lindberghs, flight, to, europe, did, not, become, public, until, a, full, day, later, and, even, after, the, identity, of, their, ship, became, known, radiograms, addressed, to, lindbergh, on, it, were, returned, as, addressee, not, aboard, they, arrived, in, liverpool, on, december, 31, then, departed, for, south, wales, to, stay, with,

four, acre, 1, 6, ha, island, lindbergh, purchased, off, the, breton, coast, of, france, except, for, a, brief, visit, to, the, u, s, in, december, 1937, the, lindberghs, lived, and, traveled, extensively, around, europe, in, their, personal, miles, m, 12, mohawk, two, person, airplane, before, returning, to, the, u, s, in, april, 1939, and, settling, in, a, rented, seaside, estate, at, lloyd, neck, long, island, new, york, the, return, was, prompted, by, a, personal, request, by, general, h, h, hap, arnold, the, chief, of, the, united, states, army, air, corps, in, which, lindbergh, was, a, reserve, colonel, for, him, to, accept, a, temporary, return, to, active, duty, to, help, evaluate, the, air, corps, s, readiness, for, war, his, duties, included, evaluating, new, aircraft, types, in, development, recruitment, procedures, and, finding, a, site, for, a, new, air, force, research, institute, and, other, potential, air, bases, assigned, a, curtiss, p, 36, fighter, he, toured, various, facilities, reporting, back, to, wilbur, wright, field, lindbergh, s, brief, four, month, tour, was, also, his, first, period, of, active, military, service, since, his, graduation, from, the, army, s, flight, school, fourteen, years, earlier, in, 1925, lindbergh, wrote, to, the, longines, watch, company, and, described, a, watch, that, would, make, navigation, easier, for, pilots, first, produced, in, 1931, they, called, it, the, lindbergh, hour, angle, watch, and, it, remains, in, production, today, in, 1929, lindbergh, became, interested, in, the, work, of, rocket, pioneer, robert, h, goddard, by, helping, goddard, secure, an, endowment, from, daniel, guggenheim, in, 1930, lindbergh, allowed, goddard, to, expand, his, research, and, development, throughout, his, life, lindbergh, remained, a, key, advocate, of, goddard, s, work, in, 1930, lindbergh, s, sister, in, law, developed, a, fatal, heart, condition, lindbergh, began, to, wonder, why, hearts, could, not, be, repaired, with, surgery, starting, in, early, 1931, at, the, rockefeller, institute, and, continuing, during, his, time, living, in, france, lindbergh, studied, the, perfusion, of, organs, outside, the, body, with, nobel, prize, winning, french, surgeon, alexis, carrel, although, perfused, organs, were, said, to, have, survived, surprisingly, well, all, showed, progressive, degenerative, changes, within, a, few, days, lindbergh, s, invention, a, glass, perfusion, pump, named, the, model, t, pump, is, credited, with, making, future, heart, surgeries, possible, in, this, early, stage, the, pump, was, far, from, perfected, in, 1938, lindbergh, and, carrel, described, an, artificial, heart, in, the, book, in, which, they, summarized, their, work, the, culture, of, organs, but, it, was, decades, before, one, was, built, in, later, years, lindbergh, s, pump, was, further, developed, by, others, eventually, leading, to, the, construction, of, the, first, heart, lung, machine, in, july, 1936, shortly, before, the, opening, of, the, 1936, summer, olympics, in, berlin, american, journalist, william, l, shirer, recorded, in, his, diary, the, lindberghs, are, here, and, the, nazis, led, by, g, ring, are, making, a, great, play, for, them, this, 1936, visit, was, the, first, of, several, that, lindbergh, made, at, the, request, of, the, u, s, military, establishment, between, 1936, and, 1938, with, the, goal, of, evaluating, german, aviation, during, this, visit, the, lufthansa, airline, held, a, tea, for, the, lindberghs, and, later, invited, them, for, a, ride, aboard, the, massive, four, engine, junkers, g, 38, that, had, been, christened, field, marshal, von, hindenburg, shirer, who, was, on, the, flight, wrote, somewhere, over, wannsee, lindbergh, took, the, controls, himself, and, treated, us, to, some, very, steep, banks, considering, the, size, of, the, plane, and, other, little, manoeuvres, which, terrified, most, of, the, passengers, the, talk, is, that, the, lindberghs, have, been, favorably, impressed, by, what, the, nazis, have, shown, them, he, has, shown, no, enthusiasm, for, meeting, the, foreign, correspondents, who, have, a, perverse, liking, for, enlightening, visitors, on, the, third, reich, as, they, see, it, and, we, have, not, pressed, for, an, interview, hanna, reitsch, demonstrated, the, focke, wulf, fw, 61, helicopter, to, lindbergh, in, 1937, 121, and, he, was, the, first, american, to, examine, germany, s, newest, bomber, the, junkers, ju, 88, and, germany, s, front, line, fighter, aircraft, the, messerschmitt, bf, 109, which, he, was, allowed, to, pilot, he, said, of, the, bf, 109, that, he, knew, of, no, other, pursuit, plane, which, combines, simplicity, of, construction, with, such, excellent, performance, characteristics, there, is, disagreement, on, how, accurate, lindbergh, s, reports, were, but, cole, asserts, that, the, consensus, among, british, and, american, officials, was, that, they, were, slightly, exaggerated, but, badly, needed, arthur, krock, the, chief, of, the, new, york, times, s, washington, bureau, wrote, in, 1939, when, the, new, flying, fleet, of, the, united, states, begins, to, take, air, among, those, who, will, have, been, responsible, for, its, size, its, modernness, and, its, efficiency, is, colonel, charles, a, lindbergh, informed, officials, here, in, touch, with, what, colonel, lindbergh, has, been, doing, for, his, country, abroad, are, authority, for, this, statement, and, for, the, further, observation, that, criticism, of, any, of, his, activities, in, germany, or, elsewhere, is, as, ignorant, as, it, is, unfair, general, henry, h, arnold, the, only, u, s, air, force, general, to, hold, five, star, rank, wrote, in, his, autobiography, nobody, gave, us, much, useful, information, about, hitler, s, air, force, until, lindbergh, came, home, in, 1939, lindbergh, also, undertook, a, survey, of, aviation, in, the, soviet, union, in, 1938, in, 1938, hugh, wilson, the, american, ambassador, to, germany, hosted, a, dinner, for, lindbergh, with, germany, s, air, chief, generalfeldmarschall, hermann, g, ring, and, three, central, figures, in, german, aviation, ernst, heinkel, adolf, baeumker, and, willy, messerschmitt, at, this, dinner, g, ring, presented, lindbergh, with, the, commander, cross, of, the, order, of, the, german, eagle, lindbergh, s, acceptance, became, controversial, when, only, a, few, weeks, after, this, visit, the, nazi, party, carried, out, the, kristallnacht, a, nation, wide, anti, jewish, pogrom, which, is, now, considered, a, key, inaugurating, event, of, the, holocaust, lindbergh, declined, to, return, the, medal, later, writing, it, seems, to, me, that, the, returning, of, decorations, which, were, given, in, times, of, peace, and, as, a, gesture, of, friendship, can, have, no, constructive, effect, if, i, were, to, return, the, german, medal, it, seems, to, me, that, it, would, be, an, unnecessary, insult, even, if, war, develops, between, us, i, can, see, no, gain, in, indulging, in, a, spitting, contest, before, that, war, begins, regarding, this, ambassador, wilson, later, wrote, to, lindbergh, neither, you, nor, i, nor, any, other, american, present, had, any, previous, hint, that, the, presentation, would, be, made, i, have, always, felt, that, if, you, refused, the, decoration, presented, under, those, circumstances, you, would, have, been, guilty, of, a, breach, of, good, taste, it, would, have, been, an, act, offensive, to, a, guest, of, the, ambassador, of, your, country, in, the, house, of, the, ambassador, lindbergh, s, reaction, to, the, kristallnacht, was, entrusted, to, his, diary, i, do, not, understand, these, riots, on, the, part, of, the, germans, he, wrote, it, seems, so, contrary, to, their, sense, of, order, and, intelligence, they, have, undoubtedly, had, a, difficult, jewish, problem, but, why, is, it, necessary, to, handle, it, so, unreasonably, later, though, many, would, note, the, careful, and, orderly, fashion, in, which, the, holocaust, was, carried, out, with, jews, identified, shipped, to, concentration, camps, and, most, murdered, lindbergh, had, planned, to, move, to, berlin, for, the, winter, of, 1938, 39, he, had, provisionally, found, a, house, in, wannsee, but, after, nazi, friends, discouraged, him, from, leasing, it, because, it, had, been, formerly, owned, by, jews, it, was, recommended, that, he, contact, albert, speer, who, said, he, would, build, the, lindberghs, a, house, anywhere, they, wanted, on, the, advice, of, his, close, friend, alexis, carrel, he, cancelled, the, trip, in, 1938, the, u, s, air, attach, in, berlin, invited, lindbergh, to, inspect, the, rising, power, of, nazi, germany, s, air, force, impressed, by, german, technology, and, the, apparently, large, number, of, aircraft, at, their, disposal, and, influenced, by, the, staggering, number, of, deaths, from, world, war, i, he, opposed, u, s, entry, into, the, impending, european, conflict, in, september, 1938, he, stated, to, the, french, cabinet, that, the, luftwaffe, possessed, 8, 000, aircraft, and, could, produce, 1, 500, per, month, although, this, was, seven, times, the, actual, number, determined, by, the, deuxi, me, bureau, it, influenced, france, into, trying, to, avoid, conflict, with, nazi, germany, through, the, munich, agreement, at, the, urging, of, u, s, ambassador, joseph, kennedy, lindbergh, wrote, a, secret, memo, to, the, british, warning, that, a, military, response, by, britain, and, france, to, hitler, s, violation, of, the, munich, agreement, would, be, disastrous, he, claimed, that, france, was, militarily, weak, and, britain, over, reliant, on, its, navy, he, urgently, recommended, that, they, strengthen, their, air, power, to, force, hitler, to, redirect, his, aggression, against, asiatic, communism, following, hitler, s, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, and, poland, lindbergh, opposed, sending, aid, to, countries, under, threat, writing, i, do, not, believe, that, repealing, the, arms, embargo, would, assist, democracy, in, europe, and, if, we, repeal, the, arms, embargo, with, the, idea, of, assisting, one, of, the, warring, sides, to, overcome, the, other, then, why, mislead, ourselves, by, talk, of, neutrality, he, equated, assistance, with, war, profiteering, to, those, who, argue, that, we, could, make, a, profit, and, build, up, our, own, industry, by, selling, munitions, abroad, i, reply, that, we, in, america, have, not, yet, reached, a, point, where, we, wish, to, capitalize, on, the, destruction, and, death, of, war, in, august, 1939, lindbergh, was, the, first, choice, of, albert, einstein, whom, he, met, years, earlier, in, new, york, to, deliver, the, einstein, szil, rd, letter, alerting, president, roosevelt, about, the, vast, potential, of, nuclear, fission, however, lindbergh, did, not, respond, to, einstein, s, letter, or, to, szilard, s, later, letter, of, september, 13, two, days, later, lindbergh, gave, a, nationwide, radio, address, in, which, he, called, for, isolationism, and, indicated, some, pro, german, sympathies, and, antisemitic, insinuations, about, jewish, ownership, of, the, media, saying, we, must, ask, who, owns, and, influences, the, newspaper, the, news, picture, and, the, radio, station, if, our, people, know, the, truth, our, country, is, not, likely, to, enter, the, war, after, that, szilard, stated, to, einstein, lindbergh, is, not, our, man, 475, in, october, 1939, following, the, outbreak, of, hostilities, between, britain, and, germany, and, a, month, after, the, canadian, declaration, of, war, on, germany, lindbergh, made, another, nationwide, radio, address, criticizing, canada, for, drawing, the, western, hemisphere, into, a, european, war, simply, because, they, prefer, the, crown, of, england, to, the, independence, of, the, americas, lindbergh, went, on, to, further, state, his, opinion, that, the, entire, continent, and, its, surrounding, islands, needed, to, be, free, from, the, dictates, of, european, powers, in, november, 1939, lindbergh, authored, a, controversial, reader, s, digest, article, in, which, he, deplored, the, war, but, asserted, the, need, for, a, german, assault, on, the, soviet, union, lindbergh, wrote, our, civilization, depends, on, peace, among, western, nations, and, therefore, on, united, strength, for, peace, is, a, virgin, who, dare, not, show, her, face, without, strength, her, father, for, protection, in, late, 1940, lindbergh, became, the, spokesman, of, the, isolationist, america, first, committee, soon, speaking, to, overflow, crowds, at, madison, square, garden, and, chicago, s, soldier, field, with, millions, listening, by, radio, he, argued, emphatically, that, america, had, no, business, attacking, germany, lindbergh, justified, this, stance, in, writings, that, were, only, published, posthumously, i, was, deeply, concerned, that, the, potentially, gigantic, power, of, america, guided, by, uninformed, and, impractical, idealism, might, crusade, into, europe, to, destroy, hitler, without, realizing, that, hitler, s, destruction, would, lay, europe, open, to, the, rape, loot, and, barbarism, of, soviet, russia, s, forces, causing, possibly, the, fatal, wounding, of, western, civilization, in, april, 1941, he, argued, before, 30, 000, members, of, the, america, first, committee, that, the, british, government, has, one, last, desperate, plan, to, persuade, us, to, send, another, american, expeditionary, force, to, europe, and, to, share, with, england, militarily, as, well, as, financially, the, fiasco, of, this, war, in, his, 1941, testimony, before, the, house, committee, on, foreign, affairs, opposing, the, lend, lease, bill, lindbergh, proposed, that, the, united, states, negotiate, a, neutrality, pact, with, germany, president, franklin, roosevelt, publicly, decried, lindbergh, s, views, as, those, of, a, defeatist, and, appeaser, comparing, him, to, u, s, rep, clement, l, vallandigham, who, had, led, the, copperhead, movement, opposed, to, the, american, civil, war, following, this, lindbergh, resigned, his, colonel, s, commission, in, the, u, s, army, air, corps, reserve, on, april, 28, 1941, writing, that, he, saw, no, honorable, alternative, given, that, roosevelt, had, publicly, questioned, his, loyalty, the, next, day, the, new, york, times, ran, an, above, the, fold, front, page, article, about, his, resignation, on, september, 11, 1941, lindbergh, delivered, a, speech, for, an, america, first, rally, at, the, des, moines, coliseum, that, accused, three, groups, of, pressing, this, country, toward, war, the, british, the, jewish, and, the, roosevelt, administration, he, said, that, the, british, were, propagandizing, america, because, they, couldn, t, defeat, nazi, germany, without, american, aid, and, that, the, presidency, of, franklin, d, roosevelt, was, trying, to, use, a, war, to, consolidate, power, the, three, paragraphs, lindbergh, devoted, to, accusing, american, jews, of, war, agitation, formed, what, biographer, a, scott, berg, called, the, core, of, his, thesis, in, the, speech, lindbergh, said, that, jewish, americans, had, outsized, control, over, government, and, news, media, even, though, jews, did, not, compose, even, 3, of, newspaper, publishers, and, were, only, a, minority, of, foreign, policy, bureaucrats, employing, recognizably, antisemitic, tropes, the, speech, received, a, strong, public, backlash, as, newspapers, politicians, and, clergy, throughout, the, country, criticized, america, first, and, lindbergh, for, his, remarks, antisemitism, lindbergh, s, anticommunism, resonated, deeply, with, many, americans, while, his, pro, eugenics, views, and, nordicism, enjoyed, social, acceptance, his, speeches, and, writings, reflected, his, adoption, of, views, on, race, religion, and, eugenics, similar, to, those, of, the, german, nazis, and, he, was, suspected, of, being, a, nazi, sympathizer, however, during, a, speech, in, september, 1941, lindbergh, stated, no, person, with, a, sense, of, the, dignity, of, mankind, can, condone, the, persecution, of, the, jewish, race, in, germany, interventionist, pamphlets, pointed, out, that, his, efforts, were, praised, in, nazi, germany, and, included, quotations, such, as, racial, strength, is, vital, politics, a, luxury, roosevelt, disliked, lindbergh, s, outspoken, opposition, to, his, administration, s, interventionist, policies, telling, treasury, secretary, henry, morgenthau, if, i, should, die, tomorrow, i, want, you, to, know, this, i, am, absolutely, convinced, lindbergh, is, a, nazi, in, 1941, he, wrote, to, secretary, of, war, henry, stimson, when, i, read, lindbergh, s, speech, i, felt, that, it, could, not, have, been, better, put, if, it, had, been, written, by, goebbels, himself, what, a, pity, that, this, youngster, has, completely, abandoned, his, belief, in, our, form, of, government, and, has, accepted, nazi, methods, because, apparently, they, are, efficient, shortly, after, the, war, ended, lindbergh, toured, a, nazi, concentration, camp, and, wrote, in, his, diary, here, was, a, place, where, men, and, life, and, death, had, reached, the, lowest, form, of, degradation, how, could, any, reward, in, national, progress, even, faintly, justify, the, establishment, and, operation, of, such, a, place, lindbergh, seemed, to, state, that, he, believed, the, survival, of, the, white, race, was, more, important, than, the, survival, of, democracy, in, europe, our, bond, with, europe, is, one, of, race, and, not, of, political, ideology, he, declared, critics, have, noticed, an, apparent, influence, on, lindbergh, of, german, philosopher, oswald, spengler, spengler, was, a, conservative, authoritarian, popular, during, the, interwar, period, though, he, had, fallen, out, of, favor, with, the, nazis, because, he, had, not, wholly, subscribed, to, their, theories, of, racial, purity, in, a, 1935, interview, lindbergh, stated, there, is, no, escaping, the, fact, that, men, were, definitely, not, created, equal, lindbergh, developed, a, long, term, friendship, with, the, automobile, pioneer, henry, ford, who, was, well, known, for, his, antisemitic, newspaper, the, dearborn, independent, in, a, famous, comment, about, lindbergh, to, detroit, s, former, fbi, field, office, special, agent, in, charge, in, july, 1940, ford, said, when, charles, comes, out, here, we, only, talk, about, the, jews, lindbergh, considered, russia, a, semi, asiatic, country, compared, to, germany, and, he, believed, communism, was, an, ideology, that, would, destroy, the, west, s, racial, strength, and, replace, everyone, of, european, descent, with, a, pressing, sea, of, yellow, black, and, brown, he, stated, that, if, he, had, to, choose, he, would, rather, see, america, allied, with, nazi, germany, than, soviet, russia, he, preferred, nordics, but, he, believed, after, soviet, communism, was, defeated, russia, would, be, a, valuable, ally, against, potential, aggression, from, east, asia, lindbergh, elucidated, his, beliefs, regarding, the, white, race, in, a, 1939, article, in, reader, s, digest, we, can, have, peace, and, security, only, so, long, as, we, band, together, to, preserve, that, most, priceless, possession, our, inheritance, of, european, blood, only, so, long, as, we, guard, ourselves, against, attack, by, foreign, armies, and, dilution, by, foreign, races, lindbergh, said, certain, races, have, demonstrated, superior, ability, in, the, design, manufacture, and, operation, of, machines, and, that, the, growth, of, our, western, civilization, has, been, closely, related, to, this, superiority, lindbergh, admired, the, german, genius, for, science, and, organization, the, english, genius, for, government, and, commerce, the, french, genius, for, living, and, the, understanding, of, life, he, believed, in, america, they, can, be, blended, to, form, the, greatest, genius, of, all, in, his, book, the, american, axis, holocaust, researcher, and, investigative, journalist, max, wallace, agreed, with, franklin, roosevelt, s, assessment, that, lindbergh, was, pro, nazi, however, he, found, that, the, roosevelt, administration, s, accusations, of, dual, loyalty, or, treason, were, unsubstantiated, wallace, considered, lindbergh, to, be, a, well, intentioned, but, bigoted, and, misguided, nazi, sympathizer, whose, career, as, the, leader, of, the, isolationist, movement, had, a, destructive, impact, on, jewish, people, lindbergh, s, pulitzer, prize, winning, biographer, a, scott, berg, contended, that, lindbergh, was, not, so, much, a, supporter, of, the, nazi, regime, as, someone, so, stubborn, in, his, convictions, and, relatively, inexperienced, in, political, maneuvering, that, he, easily, allowed, rivals, to, portray, him, as, one, lindbergh, s, receipt, of, the, order, of, the, german, eagle, presented, in, october, 1938, by, generalfeldmarschall, hermann, g, ring, on, behalf, of, f, hrer, adolf, hitler, was, approved, without, objection, by, the, american, embassy, lindbergh, returned, to, the, united, states, in, early, 1939, to, spread, his, message, of, nonintervention, berg, contended, lindbergh, s, views, were, commonplace, in, the, united, states, in, the, interwar, era, lindbergh, s, support, for, the, america, first, committee, was, representative, of, the, sentiments, of, a, number, of, american, people, berg, also, noted, as, late, as, april, 1939, after, germany, overtook, czechoslovakia, lindbergh, was, willing, to, make, excuses, for, adolf, hitler, much, as, i, disapprove, of, many, things, hitler, had, done, he, wrote, in, his, diary, on, april, 2, 1939, i, believe, she, has, pursued, the, only, consistent, policy, in, europe, in, recent, years, i, cannot, support, her, broken, promises, but, she, has, only, moved, a, little, faster, than, other, nations, in, breaking, promises, the, question, of, right, and, wrong, is, one, thing, by, law, and, another, thing, by, history, berg, also, explained, that, leading, up, to, the, war, lindbergh, believed, the, great, battle, would, be, between, the, soviet, union, and, germany, not, fascism, and, democracy, wallace, noted, that, it, was, difficult, to, find, any, social, scientists, among, lindbergh, s, contemporaries, in, the, 1930s, who, found, validity, in, racial, explanations, for, human, behavior, wallace, went, on, to, observe, throughout, his, life, eugenics, would, remain, one, of, lindbergh, s, enduring, passions, after, jews, began, to, be, murdered, on, a, large, scale, in, 1940, and, 41, many, of, those, who, had, tolerated, hitler, began, to, oppose, the, regime, but, lindbergh, continued, to, support, the, regime, until, germany, declared, war, on, the, united, states, lindbergh, always, championed, military, strength, and, alertness, he, believed, that, a, strong, defensive, war, machine, would, make, america, an, impenetrable, fortress, and, defend, the, western, hemisphere, from, an, attack, by, foreign, powers, and, that, this, was, the, u, s, military, s, sole, purpose, while, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, came, as, a, shock, to, lindbergh, he, did, predict, that, america, s, wavering, policy, in, the, philippines, would, invite, a, brutal, war, there, and, in, one, speech, warned, we, should, either, fortify, these, islands, adequately, or, get, out, of, them, entirely, in, january, 1942, lindbergh, met, with, secretary, of, war, henry, l, stimson, seeking, to, be, recommissioned, in, the, army, air, forces, stimson, was, strongly, opposed, because, of, the, long, record, of, public, comments, blocked, from, active, military, service, lindbergh, approached, a, number, of, aviation, companies, and, offered, his, services, as, a, consultant, as, a, technical, adviser, with, ford, in, 1942, he, was, heavily, involved, in, troubleshooting, early, problems, at, the, willow, run, consolidated, b, 24, liberator, bomber, production, line, as, b, 24, production, smoothed, out, he, joined, united, aircraft, in, 1943, as, an, engineering, consultant, devoting, most, of, his, time, to, its, chance, vought, division, in, 1944, lindbergh, persuaded, united, aircraft, to, send, him, as, a, technical, representative, to, the, pacific, theater, to, study, aircraft, performance, under, combat, conditions, in, preparation, for, his, deployment, to, the, pacific, lindbergh, went, to, brooks, brothers, to, buy, a, naval, officer, s, uniform, without, insignia, and, visited, brentano, s, bookstore, at, rockefeller, center, in, new, york, to, buy, a, new, testament, writing, in, his, wartime, journal, entry, for, april, 3, 1944, purchased, a, small, new, testament, at, brentano, s, since, i, can, only, carry, one, book, and, a, very, small, one, that, is, my, choice, it, would, not, have, been, a, decade, ago, but, the, more, i, learn, and, the, more, i, read, the, less, competition, it, has, he, demonstrated, how, united, states, marine, corps, aviation, pilots, could, take, off, safely, with,

mcdonough, who, refused, to, fly, with, lindbergh, again, as, he, did, not, want, to, be, known, as, the, guy, who, killed, lindbergh, in, his, six, months, in, the, pacific, in, 1944, lindbergh,

a, large, portion, of, the, world, poland, is, not, free, nor, the, baltic, states, nor, the, balkans, fear, hatred, and, mistrust, are, breeding, in, lindbergh, s, words, soviet, and, communist, influence, over, the, post, war, world, meant, that, while, our, soldiers, have, been, victorious, america, had, nonetheless, not, accomplished, the, objectives, for, which, we, went, to, war, and, he, declared, we, have, not, established, peace, or, liberty, in, europe, commenting, on, the, post, war, world, lindbergh, said, that, a, whole, civilization, is, in, disintegration, and, believed, america, needed, to, support, europe, against, communism, because, america, had, taken, a, leading, part, in, world, war, ii, he, said, it, therefore, could, not, retire, now, and, leave, europe, to, the, destructive, forces, that, the, war, had, let, loose, while, he, still, believed, his, prewar, non, interventionism, was, correct, lindbergh, said, the, united, states, now, had, a, responsibility, to, support, europe, because, of, honor, self, respect, and, our, own, national, interests, furthermore, he, wrote, that, we, could, not, let, atrocities, such, as, those, of, the, concentration, camps, go, unpunished, and, he, firmly, supported, the, nuremberg, trials, after, the, war, lindbergh, toured, germany, covering, almost, two, thousand, miles, during, his, last, two, weeks, in, the, country, and, also, traveled, to, paris, and, participated, in, conferences, with, military, personnel, and, the, american, ambassador, during, the, same, trip, while, in, germany, in, june, 1945, he, toured, dora, concentration, camp, inspecting, the, tunnels, of, nordhausen, and, viewing, v, 1, and, v, 2, missile, parts, he, attempted, to, reconcile, as, berg, wrote, the, technology, he, saw, with, how, the, forces, of, evil, had, harnessed, it, reflecting, on, what, happened, in, the, camps, lindbergh, wrote, in, his, wartime, journal, that, it, seemed, impossible, that, men, civilized, men, could, degenerate, to, such, a, level, yet, they, had, in, the, following, page, in, his, journal, he, also, lamented, the, mistreatment, of, japanese, people, by, americans, and, other, allied, personnel, during, the, war, comparing, these, incidents, to, what, the, germans, did, as, berg, wrote, in, 1998, lindbergh, returned, from, this, two, month, european, journey, more, alarmed, about, the, state, of, the, world, than, ever, but, nonetheless, he, knew, that, the, american, public, no, longer, gave, a, hoot, for, his, opinions, drawing, lessons, from, the, war, lindbergh, stated, no, peace, will, last, that, is, not, based, on, christian, principles, on, justice, on, compassion, on, a, sense, of, the, dignity, of, man, without, such, principles, there, can, be, no, lasting, strength, the, germans, found, that, out, soon, after, returning, to, america, lindbergh, paid, a, visit, to, his, mother, in, detroit, and, on, the, train, home, he, wrote, a, letter, wherein, he, mentioned, a, spiritual, awareness, speaking, of, how, important, it, was, to, spend, time, in, the, garden, take, in, the, sun, and, listen, to, birds, in, berg, s, words, this, letter, revealed, a, changed, man, as, time, went, on, lindbergh, became, increasingly, spiritual, in, his, outlook, and, grew, concerned, with, the, impact, science, and, technology, had, on, the, world, in, 1948, his, of, flight, and, life, was, published, a, book, that, has, been, described, as, an, impassioned, warning, against, the, dangers, of, scientific, materialism, and, the, powers, of, technology, in, this, book, he, wrote, of, his, experiences, as, a, combat, pilot, in, the, pacific, theater, and, declared, his, conversion, from, a, worshiper, of, science, to, a, worshiper, of, the, eternal, truths, of, god, expressing, concern, for, humanity, s, future, in, 1949, he, received, the, wright, brothers, memorial, trophy, and, declared, in, his, acceptance, speech, if, we, are, to, be, finally, successful, we, must, measure, scientific, accomplishments, by, their, effect, on, man, himself, on, april, 7, 1954, on, the, recommendation, of, president,

cronkite, s, live, television, coverage, he, later, wrote, the, foreword, to, apollo, astronaut, michael, collins, s, autobiography, while, he, maintained, his, interest, in, technology, lindbergh, began, to, focus, more, on, protecting, the, natural, world, and, after, viewing, the, apollo, 11, launch, he, participated, in, a, wwf, sponsored, dedication, of, a, 900, acre, bird, preserve,

activities, with, them, even, after, his, death, the, three, women, none, of, whom, ever, married, all, managed, to, keep, their, affairs, secret, even, from, their, children, who, during, his, lifetime, and, for, almost, a, decade, after, his, death, did, not, know, the, true, identity, of, their, father, whom, they, had, only, known, by, the, alias, careu, kent, and, seen, only, when, he, briefly, visited, them, once, or, twice, a, year, however, after, reading, a, magazine, article, about, lindbergh, in, the, mid, 1980s, brigitte, s, daughter, astrid, deduced, the, truth, she, later, discovered, photographs, and, more, than, 150, love, letters, from, lindbergh, to, her, mother, after, brigitte, and, anne, lindbergh, had, both, died, she, made, her, findings, public, in, 2003, dna,

protect, them, perhaps, to, protect, himself, absolutely, in, later, life, lindbergh, was, heavily, involved, in, conservation, movements, and, was, deeply, concerned, about, the, negative, impacts, of, new, technologies, on, the, natural, world, and, native, peoples, focusing, on, regions, like, hawaii, africa, and, the, philippines, he, campaigned, to, protect, endangered, species, including, the, humpback, whale, blue, whale, philippine, eagle, and, the, tamaraw, a, rare, dwarf, philippine, buffalo, and, was, instrumental, in, establishing, protections, for, the, tasaday, and, agta,

protect, arctic, wolves, in, alaska, and, helped, establish, voyageurs, national, park, in, northern, minnesota, in, an, essay, appearing, in, the, july, 1964, reader, s, digest, lindbergh, wrote, about, a, realization, he, had, in, kenya, during, a, trip, to, see, land, being, considered, for, a, national, park, he, contrasted, his, time, amid, the, african, landscape, with, his, involvement, in, a, supersonic, transport, convention, in, new, york, and, while, lying, under, an, acacia, tree, he, realized, how, the, construction, of, an, airplane, was, simple, compared, to, the, evolutionary, achievement, of, a, bird, he, wrote, that, if, i, had, to, choose, i, would, rather, have, birds, than, airplanes, in, this, essay, he, questioned, his, old, definition, of, progress, and, concluded, that, nature, displayed, more, actual, progress, than, humanity, s, creations, he, wrote, several, more, essays, for, reader, s, digest, and, life, urging, people, to, respect, the, self, awareness, that, came, from, contact, with, nature, which, he, called, the, wisdom, of, wildness, and, not, merely, follow, science, as, david, boocker, wrote, in, 2009, lindbergh, s, essays, appearing, in, popular, magazines, introduced, millions, of, people, to, the, conservation, cause, and, he, made, an, important, appeal, to, lead, a, life, less, complicated, by, technology, on, may, 14, 1971, lindbergh, received, the, philippine, order, of, the, golden, heart, at, a, formal, dinner, at, malaca, ang, palace, in, manila, he, was, described, as, an, aviation, pioneer, who, had, symbolized, the, advance, of, technology, and, who, now, was, a, symbol, of, the, drive, to, protect, natural, life, from, technology, lindbergh, actively, participated, in, both, conservation, and, advocacy, for, tribal, minorities, in, the, philippines, frequently, visiting, the, country, and, working, to, protect, species, including, the, tamaraw, and, philippine, eagle, which, he, described, as, a, magnificent, bird, lending, his, name, to, a, law, against, killing, or, trapping, the, animal, in, august, 1971, in, davao, city, he, ceremonially, received, a, young, philippine, eagle, kept, in, captivity, after, its, mother, was, killed, by, a, hunter, delaying, his, return, to, the, united, states, so, he, could, take, part, in, the, presentation, arturo, garcia, a, movie, theater, manager, in, davao, had, bought, the, bird, for, 40, in, march, 1970, after, the, hunting, incident, and, built, a, large, cage, for, it, behind, his, house, lindbergh, entered, the, cage, with, jesus, alvarez, director, of, the, philippines, park, and, wildlife, commission, received, the, eagle, and, then, turned, it, over, to, alvarez, remarking, now, we, have, to, see, if, the, bird, can, go, back, to, its, natural, place, the, associated, press, reported, on, both, lindbergh, s, reception, of, the, order, of, the, golden, heart, and, the, presentation, of, the, eagle, lindbergh, s, speeches, and, writings, in, later, life, centered, on, technology, and, nature, and, his, lifelong, belief, that, all, the, achievements, of, mankind, have, value, only, to, the, extent, that, they, preserve, and, improve, the, quality, of, life, in, 1972, lindbergh, undertook, an, expedition, with, a, television, news, crew, to, mindanao, in, the, philippines, to, investigate, reports, of, a, lost, tribe, the, tasaday, a, philippine, indigenous, people, of, the, lake, sebu, area, were, attracting, much, media, attention, at, the, time, although, both, nbc, evening, news, and, national, geographic, ran, stories, about, the, supposed, discovery, of, the, tribe, a, controversy, emerged, over, whether, the, tasaday, were, truly, uncontacted, or, had, just, been, portrayed, that, way, for, media, attention, particularly, by, manuel, elizalde, jr, a, philippine, politician, who, publicized, the, tribe, and, were, in, reality, not, completely, isolated, lindbergh, himself, cooperated, with, elizalde, to, get, a, proclamation, from, president, ferdinand, marcos, to, preserve, more, than, 46, 000, acres, of, tasaday, country, however, during, lindbergh, s, expedition,

foot, 910, m, high, jungle, ridge, line, and, because, of, this, terrain, the, sikorsky, had, to, hover, with, the, nose, wheel, on, one, side, of, the, ridge, and, the, main, wheels, on, the, other, with, the, boarding, steps, a, few, feet, over, the, ridge, top, during, the, operation, the, helicopter, had, to, refuel, twice, prompting, lindbergh, to, comment, that, although, he, had, helped, develop, in, flight, refueling, he, had, never, been, aboard, a, helicopter, during, the, procedure, nor, on, the, receiving, end, of, it, after, more, than, twelve, hours, and, a, total, of, eight, trips, to, a, nearby, drop, point, the, mission, was, completed, and, all, 46, individuals, stranded, on, the, ridge, were, extracted, with, lindbergh, aboard, the, helicopter, then, flew, to, mactan,

than, a, week, remarking, that, it, normally, takes, several, months, but, when, you, ve, got, an, international, hero, it, kind, of, gains, some, momentum, the, helicopter, involved, in, the, rescue,

the, nature, conservancy, to, preserve, plants, and, wildlife, in, kipahulu, valley, on, the, hawaiian, island, of, maui, lindbergh, chose, the, kipahulu, valley, for, retirement, building, an, a, frame, cottage, there, in, 1971, pryor, moved, there, in, 1965, with, his, wife, mary, after, retiring, from, pan, am, lindbergh, s, choice, of, maui, as, a, retirement, home, represented, his, love, of, natural, places, and, his, lifelong, commitment, to, the, ideal, of, simplicity, commenting, on, lindbergh, s, profound, concern, with, the, impact, of, technology, on, humanity, richard, hallion, wrote, he, recognized, the, narrow, margin, on, which, society, trod, in, the, unstable, nuclear, era, and, his, work, after, world, war, ii, confirmed, his, fear, that, humanity, now, had, the, ability, to, destroy, in, minutes, what, previous, generations, had, taken, centuries, to, create, and, so, lindbergh, the, technologist, changed, to, lindbergh, the, philosopher, protector, of, the, tasaday, preaching, a, turn, from, the, materialistic, mechanistic, society, toward, a, society, based, on, simplicity, humiliation, contemplation, prayer, in, her, 1988, book, charles, a, lindbergh, and, the, american, dilemma, susan, m, gray, wrote, that, lindbergh, established, his, middle, ground, between, technology, and, human, values, embracing, both, rejecting, neither, lindbergh, spent, his, last, years, on, maui, in, his, small, rustic, seaside, home, in, 1972, he, became, sick, with, cancer, and, ultimately, died, of, lymphoma, on, the, morning, of, august, 26, 1974, at, age, 72,

radiation, treatments, he, spent, several, months, in, maui, recuperating, and, also, made, a, 26, day, stay, in, the, columbia, presbyterian, medical, center, in, new, york, but, with, little, improvement, after, he, realized, the, treatment, would, not, save, him, he, decided, to, leave, columbia, hospital, and, made, a, final, return, to, kipahulu, with, his, wife, anne, flying, to,
