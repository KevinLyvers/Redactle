hanno, the, navigator, sometimes, hannon, punic, n, greek, romanized, ann, n, was, a, carthaginian, explorer, sometimes, identified, as, a, king, who, lived, during, the, fifth, century, bc, known, for, his, naval, expedition, along, the, coast, of, west, africa, however, the, only, source, of, said, voyage, is, a, periplus, translated, into, greek, historians, have, attempted, to, identify, specific, locations, along, hanno, s, route, based, on, the, periplus, according, to, some, modern, analyses, his, expedition, could, have, potentially, reached, as, far, south, as, gabon, still, according, to, other, sources, he, could, not, have, sailed, much, further, than, coastal, southern, morocco, the, name, of, hanno, was, given, to, many, carthaginians, ancient, texts, which, specifically, mention, hanno, the, navigator, do, not, provide, much, in, the, way, of, positively, identifying, him, some, authors, referred, to, him, as, a, king, while, others, referred, to, him, with, the, latin, words, dux, leader, general, or, imperator, commander, emperor, the, greek, translation, of, hanno, s, periplus, account, names, him, a, basileus, a, term, which, may, be, interpreted, as, king, but, was, commonly, used, for, other, high, level, carthaginian, officials, the, consensus, of, scholarship, places, hanno, as, living, sometime, in, the, 5th, century, bc, identifying, him, as, a, member, of, the, aristocratic, magonid, family, r, c, c, law, identifies, hanno, as, the, son, of, hamilcar, i, hanno, s, account, the, periplus, lit, circumnavigation, remains, extant, in, greek, language, manuscripts, the, original, version, written, in, the, punic, language, has, been, lost, the, greek, translation, is, abridged, and, 101, lines, long, while, it, contains, contradictions, and, obvious, errors, it, is, probably, derived, from, an, original, carthaginian, text, the, periplus, has, survived, as, the, nearest, we, have, to, a, specimen, of, carthaginian, literature, and, one, of, the, few, extant, accounts, of, ancient, exploration, penned, by, the, explorer, himself, in, the, fifth, century, the, text, was, translated, into, greek, over, the, centuries, the, translation, was, copied, several, times, by, greek, and, greek, speaking, roman, clerks, two, copies, remain, extant, dating, to, the, 9th, and, 14th, centuries, conrad, gessner, produced, the, first, latin, translation, printed, at, zurich, in, 1559, this, summary, is, based, on, a, translation, by, al, n, oikonomides, the, proper, names, are, unchanged, from, the, translation, it, reflects, the, views, of, the, translator, and, may, ignore, more, widely, accepted, theories, among, scholars, as, the, work, begins, this, is, the, report, of, the, periplus, of, hanno, king, of, the, carthaginians, into, the, libyan, areas, of, the, earth, beyond, the, pillars, of, hercules, which, he, dedicated, in, the, sanctuary, of, kronos, with, 60, ships, and, 30, 000, people, hanno, intends, to, found, cities, along, the, african, coast, he, first, founds, one, city, then, sails, some, distance, and, founds, five, others, arriving, at, a, river, the, carthaginians, meet, the, lixitae, a, friendly, nomadic, tribe, they, learn, of, the, nearby, ethiopians, and, taking, aboard, several, lixitae, set, sail, again, at, the, small, island, kerne, another, settlement, is, built, around, the, lake, chretes, and, an, unnamed, river, there, are, savage, men, and, large, wild, beasts, respectively, after, returning, to, kerne, they, sail, further, south, down, africa, finding, ethiopians, whose, language, even, the, lixitae, interpreters, do, not, understand, passing, further, hanno, finds, an, immense, opening, of, the, sea, from, which, fires, may, be, sighted, at, a, bay, called, the, horn, of, the, west, they, land, on, an, island, where, humans, live, the, carthaginians, hurry, away, in, fear, and, reach, lands, where, there, are, many, flames, a, very, tall, mountain, is, there, finally, arriving, at, a, bay, the, horn, of, the, south, there, is, an, island, with, hostile, hirsute, men, named, gorillas, see, gorillai, three, of, them, are, killed, their, skins, brought, home, to, carthage, having, run, out, of, provisions, they, do, not, sail, further, the, periplus, abruptly, ends, here, without, discussing, the, return, journey, both, ancient, and, modern, authors, have, criticized, the, work, most, attempts, to, locate, the, places, described, in, the, periplus, based, on, the, reported, sailing, distances, and, directions, have, failed, to, make, the, text, more, accurate, scholars, have, tried, textual, criticism, ultimately, the, carthaginians, probably, edited, the, real, account, to, protect, their, trade, other, countries, would, not, be, able, to, identify, the, places, described, while, carthaginians, could, still, boast, about, their, accomplishments, oikonomides, theorizes, that, the, hypothetical, punic, manuscript, that, was, translated, into, greek, was, incomplete, itself, it, left, out, the, later, parts, of, the, original, periplus, the, ending, of, the, narrative, is, abrupt, and, it, would, also, have, been, logically, impossible, for, the, expedition, to, end, as, described, therefore, he, argues, the, final, two, lines, must, have, been, inserted, to, compensate, for, an, incomplete, manuscript, carthage, dispatched, hanno, at, the, head, of, a, fleet, of, 60, ships, to, explore, and, colonize, the, northwestern, coast, of, africa, he, sailed, west, from, carthage, toward, the, iberian, peninsula, passing, through, the, modern, strait, of, gibraltar, and, founding, or, repopulating, seven, colonies, along, the, coast, of, what, is, now, morocco, he, then, continued, at, least, some, distance, further, south, along, the, continent, s, atlantic, coast, allegedly, encountering, various, indigenous, peoples, along, his, way, whom, met, the, fleet, with, a, range, of, welcomes, the, gold, trade, had, been, a, vital, foundation, of, the, carthaginian, empire, from, the, fifth, century, bc, and, may, have, been, the, original, motivation, for, the, exploration, of, sub, saharan, africa, the, purpose, of, hanno, s, voyage, was, to, secure, the, gold, route, to, west, africa, a, number, of, modern, scholars, have, commented, upon, hanno, s, voyage, stating, that, in, many, cases, the, analyses, have, been, to, refine, information, and, interpretation, of, the, original, account, william, smith, points, out, that, the, complement, of, personnel, totalled, 30, 000, men, and, that, the, core, mission, included, the, intent, to, found, carthaginian, or, in, the, older, parlance, libyophoenician, towns, other, sources, have, questioned, this, high, number, of, men, with, some, suggesting, 5, 000, to, be, a, more, accurate, number, r, c, c, law, notes, that, it, is, a, measure, of, the, obscurity, of, the, problem, that, while, some, commentators, have, argued, that, hanno, reached, the, gabon, area, others, have, taken, him, no, further, than, southern, morocco, harden, reports, a, consensus, that, the, expedition, reached, at, least, as, far, as, senegal, due, to, the, vagueness, of, the, periplus, estimates, for, the, voyage, s, distance, range, from, under, 700, miles, 1, 100, km, to, at, least, 3, 000, miles, 4, 800, km, some, agree, he, could, have, reached, gambia, however, harden, mentions, disagreement, as, to, the, farthest, limit, of, hanno, s, explorations, sierra, leone, cameroon, or, gabon, he, notes, the, description, of, mount, cameroon, a, 4, 040, metre, 13, 250, ft, volcano, more, closely, matches, hanno, s, description, than, guinea, s, 890, metre, 2, 920, ft, mount, kakoulima, warmington, prefers, mount, kakoulima, considering, mount, cameroon, too, distant, french, historian, raymond, mauny, in, his, 1955, article, la, navigation, sur, les, c, tes, du, sahara, pendant, l, antiquit, argued, that, ancient, navigators, hanno, euthymenes, scylax, etc, could, not, have, sailed, south, along, the, atlantic, coast, much, farther, than, cape, bojador, in, the, territory, of, western, sahara, carthage, reportedly, knew, of, and, conducted, some, trade, with, the, peoples, of, the, canary, islands, ancient, geographers, were, aware, of, the, archipelago, as, well, though, nothing, further, south, ships, with, square, sails, without, a, stern, rudder, might, navigate, south, but, the, winds, and, currents, throughout, the, year, would, complicate, or, prevent, the, return, trip, from, senegal, to, morocco, oared, ships, might, be, able, to, achieve, the, return, northward, but, only, with, very, great, difficulties, and, a, large, crew, mauny, assumed, that, hanno, did, not, get, farther, than, the, mouth, of, the, river, dr, a, attributing, artifacts, found, on, mogador, island, to, the, expedition, described, in, the, periplus, of, pseudo, scylax, dated, mid, 4th, century, bc, and, noting, that, no, evidence, of, mediterranean, trade, further, south, had, yet, been, found, the, author, ends, by, suggesting, archaeological, investigations, of, the, islands, along, the, coast, such, as, cape, verde, or, the, le, de, hern, dragon, island, near, dakhla, western, sahara, where, ancient, adventurers, may, have, been, stranded, and, settled, the, end, of, the, periplus, describes, an, island, populated, with, hairy, and, savage, people, attempts, to, capture, the, men, failed, three, of, the, women, were, taken, but, were, so, ferocious, that, they, were, killed, their, skins, brought, home, to, carthage, the, skins, were, kept, in, the, temple, of, juno, tanit, or, astarte, on, hanno, s, return, and, according, to, pliny, the, elder, survived, until, the, roman, destruction, of, carthage, in, 146, bc, some, 350, years, after, hanno, s, expedition, hanno, s, interpreters, of, an, african, tribe, lixites, or, nasamonians, called, the, people, gorillai, in, greek, in, 1847, the, gorilla, an, ape, species, was, scientifically, described, and, named, after, the, gorillai, the, authors, did, not, affirmatively, identify, hanno, s, gorillai, as, the, gorilla, the, text, was, known, to, the, roman, pliny, the, elder, c, 23, 79, and, the, greek, arrian, of, nicomedia, c, 86, 160, while, the, power, of, carthage, was, at, its, height, hanno, published, an, account, of, a, voyage, which, he, made, from, gades, to, the, extremity, of, arabia, himilco, was, also, sent, about, the, same, time, to, explore, the, remote, parts, of, europe, pliny, may, have, recorded, the, time, vaguely, because, he, was, ignorant, of, the, actual, date, his, claim, that, hanno, completely, circumnavigated, africa, reaching, arabia, is, considered, unrealistic, by, contemporary, scholarship, arrian, mentions, hanno, s, voyage, at, the, end, of, his, anabasis, of, alexander, viii, indica, hannon, the, libyan, set, out, from, carthage, with, libya, on, his, left, and, sailed, out, beyond, the, pillars, of, heracles, into, the, outer, sea, continuing, his, voyage, then, in, an, easterly, direction, for, a, total, of, thirty, five, days, but, when, he, eventually, turned, south, he, met, a, number, of, crippling, obstacles, lack, of, water, burning, heat, streams, of, lava, gushing, into, the, sea, greek, historian, herodotus, writing, around, 430, bc, described, carthaginian, trade, on, the, moroccan, coast, histories, 4, 196, though, it, is, doubtful, whether, he, was, aware, of, hanno, s, voyage, itself, the, lunar, crater, hanno, is, named, after, him, in, the, 16th, century, the, voyage, of, hanno, saw, increased, scholarly, interest, from, europeans, in, an, age, when, european, exploration, and, navigation, were, flourishing, already, then, the, extent, of, hanno, s, voyage, was, debated
