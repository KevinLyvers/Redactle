american, citizens, northerners, at, the, time, found, it, hard, to, believe, that, such, a, great, orator, had, once, been, enslaved, it, was, in, response, to, this, disbelief, that, douglass, wrote, his, first, autobiography, douglass, wrote, three, autobiographies, describing, his, experiences, as, an, enslaved, person, in, his, narrative, of, the, life, of, frederick, douglass, an, american, slave, 1845, which, became, a, bestseller, and, was, influential, in, promoting, the, cause, of, abolition, as, was, his, second, book, my, bondage, and, my, freedom, 1855, following, the,

lloyd, garrison, in, the, anti, slavery, interpretation, of, the, u, s, constitution, when, radical, abolitionists, under, the, motto, no, union, with, slaveholders, criticized, douglass, s, willingness, to, engage, in, dialogue, with, slave, owners, he, replied, i, would, unite, with, anybody, to, do, right, and, with, nobody, to, do, wrong, frederick, augustus, washington, bailey, was, born, into, slavery, on, the, eastern, shore, of, the, chesapeake, bay, in, talbot, county, maryland, the, plantation, was, between, hillsboro, and, cordova, his, birthplace, was, likely, his, grandmother, s, cabin, east, of, tappers, corner, and, west, of, tuckahoe, creek, in, his, first, autobiography, douglass, stated, i, have, no, accurate, knowledge, of, my, age, never, having, seen, any, authentic, record, containing, it, in, successive, autobiographies, he, gave, more, precise, estimates, of, when, he, was, born, his, final, estimate, being, 1817, however, based, on, the, extant, records, of, douglass, s, former, owner, aaron, anthony, historian, dickson, j, preston, determined, that, douglass, was, born, in, february, 1818, though, the, exact, date, of, his, birth, is, unknown, he, chose, to, celebrate, february, 14, as, his, birthday, remembering, that, his, mother, called, him, her, little, valentine, douglass, s, mother, enslaved, was, of, african, descent, and, his, father, who, may, have, been, her, master, apparently, of, european, descent, in, his, narrative, 1845, douglass, wrote, my, father, was, a, white, man, according, to, david, w, blight, s, 2018, biography, of, douglass, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, searched, in, vain, for, the, name, of, his, true, father, douglass, s, genetic, heritage, likely, also, included, native, american, douglass, said, his, mother, harriet, bailey, gave, him, his, name, frederick, augustus, washington, bailey, and, after, he, escaped, to, the, north, in, september, 1838, he, took, the, surname, douglass, having, already, dropped, his, two, middle, names, he, later, wrote, of, his, earliest, times, with, his, mother, the, opinion, was, also, whispered, that, my, master, was, my, father, but, of, the, correctness, of, this, opinion, i, know, nothing, my, mother, and, i, were, separated, when, i, was, but, an, infant, it, is, a, common, custom, in, the, part, of, maryland, from, which, i, ran, away, to, part, children, from, their, mothers, at, a, very, early, age, i, do, not, recollect, of, ever, seeing, my, mother, by, the, light, of, day, she, was, with, me, in, the, night, she, would, lie, down, with, me, and, get, me, to, sleep, but, long, before, i, waked, she, was, gone, after, separation, from, his, mother, during, infancy, young, frederick, lived, with, his, maternal, grandmother, betsy, bailey, who, was, also, enslaved, and, his, maternal, grandfather, isaac, who, was, free, betsy, would, live, until, 1849, frederick, s, mother, remained, on, the, plantation, about, 12, miles, 19, km, away, visiting, frederick, only, a, few, times, before, her, death, when, he, was, 7, years, old, returning, much, later, about, 1883, to, purchase, land, in, talbot, county, that, was, meaningful, to, him, he, was, invited, to, address, a, colored, school, i, once, knew, a, little, colored, boy, whose, mother, and, father, died, when, he, was, six, years, old, he, was, a, slave, and, had, no, one, to, care, for, him, he, slept, on, a, dirt, floor, in, a, hovel, and, in, cold, weather, would, crawl, into, a, meal, bag, head, foremost, and, leave, his, feet, in, the, ashes, to, keep, them, warm, often, he, would, roast, an, ear, of, corn, and, eat, it, to, satisfy, his, hunger, and, many, times, has, he, crawled, under, the, barn, or, stable, and, secured, eggs, which, he, would, roast, in, the, fire, and, eat, that, boy, did, not, wear, pants, like, you, do, but, a, tow, linen, shirt, schools, were, unknown, to, him, and, he, learned, to, spell, from, an, old, webster, s, spelling, book, and, to, read, and, write, from, posters, on, cellar, and, barn, doors, while, boys, and, men, would, help, him, he, would, then, preach, and, speak, and, soon, became, well, known, he, became, presidential, elector, united, states, marshal, united, states, recorder, united, states, diplomat, and, accumulated, some, wealth, he, wore, broadcloth, and, didn, t, have, to, divide, crumbs, with, the, dogs, under, the, table, that, boy, was, frederick, douglass, at, the, age, of, 6, douglass, was, separated, from, his, grandparents, and, moved, to, the, wye, house, plantation, where, aaron, anthony, worked, as, overseer, and, edward, lloyd, was, his, unofficial, master, after, anthony, died, in, 1826, douglass, was, given, to, lucretia, auld, wife, of, thomas, auld, who, sent, him, to, serve, thomas, s, brother, hugh, auld, and, his, wife, sophia, auld, in, baltimore, from, the, day, he, arrived, sophia, saw, to, it, that, douglass, was, properly, fed, and, clothed, and, that, he, slept, in, a, bed, with, sheets, and, a, blanket, douglass, described, her, as, a, kind, and, tender, hearted, woman, who, treated, him, as, she, supposed, one, human, being, ought, to, treat, another, douglass, felt, that, he, was, lucky, to, be, in, the, city, where, he, said, enslaved, people, were, almost, freemen, compared, to, those, on, plantations, when, douglass, was, about, 12, sophia, auld, began, teaching, him, the, alphabet, hugh, auld, disapproved, of, the, tutoring, feeling, that, literacy, would, encourage, enslaved, people, to, desire, freedom, douglass, later, referred, to, this, as, the, first, decidedly, antislavery, lecture, he, had, ever, heard, very, well, thought, i, wrote, douglass, knowledge, unfits, a, child, to, be, a, slave, i, instinctively, assented, to, the, proposition, and, from, that, moment, i, understood, the, direct, pathway, from, slavery, to, freedom, under, her, husband, s, influence, sophia, came, to, believe, that, education, and, slavery, were, incompatible, and, one, day, snatched, a, newspaper, away, from, douglass, she, stopped, teaching, him, altogether, and, hid, all, potential, reading, materials, including, her, bible, from, him, in, his, autobiography, douglass, related, how, he, learned, to, read, from, white, children, in, the, neighborhood, and, by, observing, the, writings, of, the, men, with, whom, he, worked, douglass, continued, secretly, to, teach, himself, to, read, and, write, he, later, often, said, knowledge, is, the, pathway, from, slavery, to, freedom, as, douglass, began, to, read, newspapers, pamphlets, political, materials, and, books, of, every, description, this, new, realm, of, thought, led, him, to, question, and, condemn, the, institution, of, slavery, in, later, years, douglass, credited, the, columbian, orator, an, anthology, that, he, discovered, at, about, age, 12, with, clarifying, and, defining, his, views, on, freedom, and, human, rights, first, published, in, 1797, the, book, is, a, classroom, reader, containing, essays, speeches, and, dialogues, to, assist, students, in, learning, reading, and, grammar, he, later, learned, that, his, mother, had, also, been, literate, about, which, he, would, later, declare, i, am, quite, willing, and, even, happy, to, attribute, any, love, of, letters, i, possess, and, for, which, i, have, got, despite, of, prejudices, only, too, much, credit, not, to, my, admitted, anglo, saxon, paternity, but, to, the, native, genius, of, my, sable, unprotected, and, uncultivated, mother, a, woman, who, belonged, to, a, race, whose, mental, endowments, it, is, at, present, fashionable, to, hold, in, disparagement, and, contempt, when, douglass, was, hired, out, to, william, freeland, he, gathered, eventually, more, than, thirty, male, slaves, on, sundays, and, sometimes, even, on, weeknights, in, a, sabbath, literacy, school, in, 1833, thomas, auld, took, douglass, back, from, hugh, s, a, means, of, punishing, hugh, douglass, later, wrote, thomas, sent, douglass, to, work, for, edward, covey, a, poor, farmer, who, had, a, reputation, as, a, slave, breaker, he, whipped, douglass, so, frequently, that, his, wounds, had, little, time, to, heal, douglass, later, said, the, frequent, whippings, broke, his, body, soul, and, spirit, the, 16, year, old, douglass, finally, rebelled, against, the, beatings, however, and, fought, back, after, douglass, won, a, physical, confrontation, covey, never, tried, to, beat, him, again, recounting, his, beatings, at, covey, s, farm, in, narrative, of, the, life, of, frederick, douglass, an, american, slave, douglass, described, himself, as, a, man, transformed, into, a, brute, still, douglass, came, to, see, his, physical, fight, with, covey, as, life, transforming, and, introduced, the, story, in, his, autobiography, as, such, you, have, seen, how, a, man, was, made, a, slave, you, shall, see, how, a, slave, was, made, a, man, douglass, first, tried, to, escape, from, freeland, who, had, hired, him, from, his, owner, but, was, unsuccessful, in, 1837, douglass, met, and, fell, in, love, with, anna, murray, a, free, black, woman, in, baltimore, about, five, years, his, senior, her, free, status, strengthened, his, belief, in, the, possibility, of, gaining, his, own, freedom, murray, encouraged, him, and, supported, his, efforts, by, aid, and, money, on, september, 3, 1838, douglass, successfully, escaped, by, boarding, a, northbound, train, of, the, philadelphia, wilmington, and, baltimore, railroad, in, baltimore, the, area, where, he, boarded, was, formerly, thought, to, be, a, short, distance, east, of, the, train, depot, in, a, recently, developed, neighborhood, between, the, modern, neighborhoods, of, harbor, east, and, little, italy, this, depot, was, at, president, and, fleet, streets, east, of, the, basin, of, the, baltimore, harbor, on, the, northwest, branch, of, the, patapsco, river, research, cited, in, 2021, however, suggests, that, douglass, in, fact, boarded, the, train, at, the, canton, depot, of, the, philadelphia, wilmington, and, baltimore, railroad, on, boston, street, in, the, canton, neighborhood, of, baltimore, further, east, douglass, reached, havre, de, grace, maryland, in, harford, county, in, the, northeast, corner, of, the, state, along, the, southwest, shore, of, the, susquehanna, river, which, flowed, into, the, chesapeake, bay, although, this, placed, him, only, some, 20, miles, 32, km, from, the, maryland, pennsylvania, state, line, it, was, easier, to, continue, by, rail, through, delaware, another, slave, state, dressed, in, a, sailor, s, uniform, provided, to, him, by, murray, who, also, gave, him, part, of, her, savings, to, cover, his, travel, costs, he, carried, identification, papers, and, protection, papers, that, he, had, obtained, from, a, free, black, seaman, douglass, crossed, the, wide, susquehanna, river, by, the, railroad, s, steam, ferry, at, havre, de, grace, to, perryville, on, the, opposite, shore, in, cecil, county, then, continued, by, train, across, the, state, line, to, wilmington, delaware, a, large, port, at, the, head, of, the, delaware, bay, from, there, because, the, rail, line, was, not, yet, completed, he, went, by, steamboat, along, the, delaware, river, farther, northeast, to, the, quaker, city, of, philadelphia, pennsylvania, an, anti, slavery, stronghold, he, continued, to, the, safe, house, of, abolitionist, david, ruggles, in, new, york, city, his, entire, journey, to, freedom, took, less, than, 24, hours, douglass, later, wrote, of, his, arrival, in, new, york, city, i, have, often, been, asked, how, i, felt, when, first, i, found, myself, on, free, soil, and, my, readers, may, share, the, same, curiosity, there, is, scarcely, anything, in, my, experience, about, which, i, could, not, give, a, more, satisfactory, answer, a, new, world, had, opened, upon, me, if, life, is, more, than, breath, and, the, quick, round, of, blood, i, lived, more, in, one, day, than, in, a, year, of, my, slave, life, it, was, a, time, of, joyous, excitement, which, words, can, but, tamely, describe, in, a, letter, written, to, a, friend, soon, after, reaching, new, york, i, said, i, felt, as, one, might, feel, upon, escape, from, a, den, of, hungry, lions, anguish, and, grief, like, darkness, and, rain, may, be, depicted, but, gladness, and, joy, like, the, rainbow, defy, the, skill, of, pen, or, pencil, once, douglass, had, arrived, he, sent, for, murray, to, follow, him, north, to, new, york, she, brought, the, basic, supplies, for, them, to, set, up, a, home, they, were, married, on, september, 15, 1838, by, a, black, presbyterian, minister, just, eleven, days, after, douglass, had, reached, new, york, at, first, they, adopted, johnson, as, their, married, name, to, divert, attention, as, a, child, douglass, was, exposed, to, a, number, of, religious, sermons, and, in, his, youth, he, sometimes, heard, sophia, auld, reading, the, bible, in, time, he, became, interested, in, literacy, he, began, reading, and, copying, bible, verses, and, he, eventually, converted, to, christianity, he, described, this, approach, in, his, last, biography, life, and, times, of, frederick, douglass, i, was, not, more, than, thirteen, years, old, when, in, my, loneliness, and, destitution, i, longed, for, some, one, to, whom, i, could, go, as, to, a, father, and, protector, the, preaching, of, a, white, methodist, minister, named, hanson, was, the, means, of, causing, me, to, feel, that, in, god, i, had, such, a, friend, he, thought, that, all, men, great, and, small, bond, and, free, were, sinners, in, the, sight, of, god, that, they, were, but, natural, rebels, against, his, government, and, that, they, must, repent, of, their, sins, and, be, reconciled, to, god, through, christ, i, cannot, say, that, i, had, a, very, distinct, notion, of, what, was, required, of, me, but, one, thing, i, did, know, well, i, was, wretched, and, had, no, means, of, making, myself, otherwise, i, consulted, a, good, coloured, man, named, charles, lawson, and, in, tones, of, holy, affection, he, told, me, to, pray, and, to, cast, all, my, care, upon, god, this, i, sought, to, do, and, though, for, weeks, i, was, a, poor, broken, hearted, mourner, traveling, through, doubts, and, fears, i, finally, found, my, burden, lightened, and, my, heart, relieved, i, loved, all, mankind, slaveholders, not, excepted, though, i, abhorred, slavery, more, than, ever, i, saw, the, world, in, a, new, light, and, my, great, concern, was, to, have, everybody, converted, my, desire, to, learn, increased, and, especially, did, i, want, a, thorough, acquaintance, with, the, contents, of, the, bible, douglass, was, mentored, by, rev, charles, lawson, and, early, in, his, activism, he, often, included, biblical, allusions, and, religious, metaphors, in, his, speeches, although, a, believer, he, strongly, criticized, religious, hypocrisy, and, accused, slaveholders, of, wickedness, lack, of, morality, and, failure, to, follow, the, golden, rule, in, this, sense, douglass, distinguished, between, the, christianity, of, christ, and, the, christianity, of, america, and, considered, religious, slaveholders, and, clergymen, who, defended, slavery, as, the, most, brutal, sinful, and, cynical, of, all, who, represented, wolves, in, sheep, s, clothing, in, what, to, the, slave, is, the, fourth, of, july, an, oration, douglass, gave, in, the, corinthian, hall, of, rochester, he, sharply, criticized, the, attitude, of, religious, people, who, kept, silent, about, slavery, and, he, charged, that, ministers, committed, a, blasphemy, when, they, taught, it, as, sanctioned, by, religion, he, considered, that, a, law, passed, to, support, slavery, was, one, of, the, grossest, infringements, of, christian, liberty, and, said, that, pro, slavery, clergymen, within, the, american, church, stripped, the, love, of, god, of, its, beauty, and, leave, the, throne, of, religion, a, huge, horrible, repulsive, form, and, an, abomination, in, the, sight, of, god, of, ministers, like, john, chase, lord, leonard, elijah, lathrop, ichabod, spencer, and, orville, dewey, he, said, that, they, taught, against, the, scriptures, that, we, ought, to, obey, man, s, law, before, the, law, of, god, he, further, asserted, in, speaking, of, the, american, church, however, let, it, be, distinctly, understood, that, i, mean, the, great, mass, of, the, religious, organizations, of, our, land, there, are, exceptions, and, i, thank, god, that, there, are, noble, men, may, be, found, scattered, all, over, these, northern, states, henry, ward, beecher, of, brooklyn, samuel, j, may, of, syracuse, and, my, esteemed, friend, he, maintained, that, upon, these, men, lies, the, duty, to, inspire, our, ranks, with, high, religious, faith, and, zeal, and, to, cheer, us, on, in, the, great, mission, of, the, slave, s, redemption, from, his, chains, in, addition, he, called, religious, people, to, embrace, abolitionism, stating, let, the, religious, press, the, pulpit, the, sunday, school, the, conference, meeting, the, great, ecclesiastical, missionary, bible, and, tract, associations, of, the, land, array, their, immense, powers, against, slavery, and, slave, holding, and, the, whole, system, of, crime, and, blood, would, be, scattered, to, the, winds, during, his, visits, to, the, united, kingdom, between, 1846, and, 1848, douglass, asked, british, christians, never, to, support, american, churches, that, permitted, slavery, and, he, expressed, his, happiness, to, know, that, a, group, of, ministers, in, belfast, had, refused, to, admit, slaveholders, as, members, of, the, church, on, his, return, to, the, united, states, douglass, founded, the, north, star, a, weekly, publication, with, the, motto, right, is, of, no, sex, truth, is, of, no, color, god, is, the, father, of, us, all, and, we, are, all, brethren, in, his, 1848, letter, to, thomas, auld, douglass, denounced, his, former, slaveholder, for, leaving, douglass, s, family, illiterate, your, wickedness, and, cruelty, committed, in, this, respect, on, your, fellow, creatures, are, greater, than, all, the, stripes, you, have, laid, upon, my, back, or, theirs, it, is, an, outrage, upon, the, soul, a, war, upon, the, immortal, spirit, and, one, for, which, you, must, give, account, at, the, bar, of, our, common, father, and, creator, sometimes, considered, a, precursor, of, a, non, denominational, liberation, theology, douglass, was, a, deeply, spiritual, man, as, his, home, continues, to, show, the, fireplace, mantle, features, busts, of, two, of, his, favorite, philosophers, david, friedrich, strauss, author, of, the, life, of, jesus, and, ludwig, feuerbach, author, of, the, essence, of, christianity, in, addition, to, several, bibles, and, books, about, various, religions, in, the, library, images, of, angels, and, jesus, are, displayed, as, well, as, interior, and, exterior, photographs, of, washington, s, metropolitan, african, methodist, episcopal, church, throughout, his, life, douglass, had, linked, that, individual, experience, with, social, reform, and, according, to, john, stauffer, he, like, other, christian, abolitionists, followed, practices, such, as, abstaining, from, tobacco, alcohol, and, other, substances, that, he, believed, corrupted, body, and, soul, douglass, stated, himself, that, he, was, a, teetotaler, according, to, david, w, blight, however, douglass, loved, cigars, and, received, them, as, gifts, from, ottilie, assing, douglass, praised, the, agnostic, orator, robert, g, ingersoll, whom, douglass, met, in, peoria, illinois, stating, genuine, goodness, is, the, same, whether, found, inside, or, outside, the, church, and, that, to, be, an, infidel, no, more, proves, a, man, to, be, selfish, mean, and, wicked, than, to, be, evangelical, proves, him, to, be, honest, just, and, human, perhaps, there, were, christian, ministers, and, christian, families, in, peoria, at, that, time, by, whom, i, might, have, been, received, in, the, same, gracious, manner, but, in, my, former, visits, to, this, place, i, had, failed, to, meet, them, douglass, and, anna, murray, had, five, children, rosetta, douglass, lewis, henry, douglass, frederick, douglass, jr, charles, remond, douglass, and, annie, douglass, died, at, the, age, of, ten, charles, and, rosetta, helped, produce, his, newspapers, anna, douglass, remained, a, loyal, supporter, of, her, husband, s, public, work, his, relationships, with, julia, griffiths, and, ottilie, assing, two, women, with, whom, he, was, professionally, involved, caused, recurring, speculation, and, scandals, assing, was, a, journalist, recently, immigrated, from, germany, who, first, visited, douglass, in, 1856, seeking, permission, to, translate, my, bondage, and, my, freedom, into, german, until, 1872, she, often, stayed, at, his, house, for, several, months, at, a, time, as, his, intellectual, and, emotional, companion, assing, held, anna, douglass, in, utter, contempt, and, was, vainly, hoping, that, douglass, would, separate, from, his, wife, douglass, biographer, david, w, blight, concludes, that, assing, and, douglass, were, probably, lovers, though, douglass, and, assing, are, widely, believed, to, have, had, an, intimate, relationship, the, surviving, correspondence, contains, no, proof, of, such, a, relationship, anna, died, in, 1882, in, 1884, douglass, married, helen, pitts, a, white, suffragist, and, abolitionist, from, honeoye, new, york, pitts, was, the, daughter, of, gideon, pitts, jr, an, abolitionist, colleague, and, friend, of, douglass, s, a, graduate, of, mount, holyoke, college, then, called, mount, holyoke, female, seminary, pitts, worked, on, a, radical, feminist, publication, named, alpha, while, living, in, washington, d, c, she, later, worked, as, douglass, s, secretary, assing, who, had, depression, and, was, diagnosed, with, incurable, breast, cancer, committed, suicide, in, france, in, 1884, after, hearing, of, the, marriage, upon, her, death, assing, bequeathed, douglass, a, 13, 000, trust, fund, a, large, album, and, his, choice, of, books, from, her, library, the, marriage, of, douglass, and, pitts, provoked, a, storm, of, controversy, since, pitts, was, both, white, and, nearly, 20, years, younger, many, in, her, family, stopped, speaking, to, her, his, children, considered, the, marriage, a, repudiation, of, their, mother, but, feminist, elizabeth, cady, stanton, congratulated, the, couple, douglass, responded, to, the, criticisms, by, saying, that, his, first, marriage, had, been, to, someone, the, color, of, his, mother, and, his, second, to, someone, the, color, of, his, father, the, couple, settled, in, new, bedford, massachusetts, an, abolitionist, center, full, of, former, enslaved, people, in, 1838, moving, to, lynn, massachusetts, in, 1841, after, meeting, and, staying, with, nathan, and, mary, johnson, they, adopted, douglass, as, their, married, name, douglass, had, grown, up, using, his, mother, s, surname, of, bailey, after, escaping, slavery, he, had, changed, his, surname, first, to, stanley, and, then, to, johnson, in, new, bedford, the, latter, was, such, a, common, name, that, he, wanted, one, that, was, more, distinctive, and, asked, nathan, johnson, to, choose, a, suitable, surname, nathan, suggested, douglass, after, having, read, the, poem, the, lady, of, the, lake, by, walter, scott, in, which, two, of, the, principal, characters, have, the, surname, douglas, douglass, thought, of, joining, a, white, methodist, church, but, was, disappointed, from, the, beginning, upon, finding, that, it, was, segregated, later, he, joined, the, african, methodist, episcopal, zion, church, an, independent, black, denomination, first, established, in, new, york, city, which, counted, among, its, members, sojourner, truth, and, harriet, tubman, he, became, a, licensed, preacher, in, 1839, which, helped, him, to, hone, his, oratorical, skills, he, held, various, positions, including, steward, sunday, school, superintendent, and, sexton, in, 1840, douglass, delivered, a, speech, in, elmira, new, york, then, a, station, on, the, underground, railroad, in, which, a, black, congregation, would, form, years, later, becoming, the, region, s, largest, church, by, 1940, douglass, also, joined, several, organizations, in, new, bedford, and, regularly, attended, abolitionist, meetings, he, subscribed, to, william, lloyd, garrison, s, weekly, newspaper, the, liberator, he, later, said, that, no, face, and, form, ever, impressed, me, with, such, sentiments, as, did, those, of, william, lloyd, garrison, so, deep, was, this, influence, that, in, his, last, autobiography, douglass, said, his, paper, took, a, place, in, my, heart, second, only, to, the, bible, garrison, was, likewise, impressed, with, douglass, and, had, written, about, his, anti, colonization, stance, in, the, liberator, as, early, as, 1839, douglass, first, heard, garrison, speak, in, 1841, at, a, lecture, that, garrison, gave, in, liberty, hall, new, bedford, at, another, meeting, douglass, was, unexpectedly, invited, to, speak, after, telling, his, story, douglass, was, encouraged, to, become, an, anti, slavery, lecturer, a, few, days, later, douglass, spoke, at, the, massachusetts, anti, slavery, society, s, annual, convention, in, nantucket, then, 23, years, old, douglass, conquered, his, nervousness, and, gave, an, eloquent, speech, about, his, life, as, a, slave, while, living, in, lynn, douglass, engaged, in, an, early, protest, against, segregated, transportation, in, september, 1841, at, lynn, central, square, station, douglass, and, his, friend, james, n, buffum, were, thrown, off, an, eastern, railroad, train, because, douglass, refused, to, sit, in, the, segregated, railroad, coach, in, 1843, douglass, joined, other, speakers, in, the, american, anti, slavery, society, s, hundred, conventions, project, a, six, month, tour, at, meeting, halls, throughout, the, eastern, and, midwestern, united, states, during, this, tour, slavery, supporters, frequently, accosted, douglass, at, a, lecture, in, pendleton, indiana, an, angry, mob, chased, and, beat, douglass, before, a, local, quaker, family, the, hardys, rescued, him, his, hand, was, broken, in, the, attack, it, healed, improperly, and, bothered, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, a, stone, marker, in, falls, park, in, the, pendleton, historic, district, commemorates, this, event, in, 1847, douglass, explained, to, garrison, i, have, no, love, for, america, as, such, i, have, no, patriotism, i, have, no, country, what, country, have, i, the, institutions, of, this, country, do, not, know, me, do, not, recognize, me, as, a, man, douglass, s, best, known, work, is, his, first, autobiography, narrative, of, the, life, of, frederick, douglass, an, american, slave, written, during, his, time, in, lynn, massachusetts, and, published, in, 1845, at, the, time, some, skeptics, questioned, whether, a, black, man, could, have, produced, such, an, eloquent, piece, of, literature, the, book, received, generally, positive, reviews, and, became, an, immediate, bestseller, within, three, years, it, had, been, reprinted, nine, times, with, 11, 000, copies, circulating, in, the, united, states, it, was, also, translated, into, french, and, dutch, and, published, in, europe, douglass, published, three, autobiographies, during, his, lifetime, and, revised, the, third, of, these, each, time, expanding, on, the, previous, one, the, 1845, narrative, was, his, biggest, seller, and, probably, allowed, him, to, raise, the, funds, to, gain, his, legal, freedom, the, following, year, as, discussed, below, in, 1855, douglass, published, my, bondage, and, my, freedom, in, 1881, in, his, sixties, douglass, published, life, and, times, of, frederick, douglass, which, he, revised, in, 1892, douglass, s, friends, and, mentors, feared, that, the, publicity, would, draw, the, attention, of, his, ex, owner, hugh, auld, who, might, try, to, get, his, property, back, they, encouraged, douglass, to, tour, ireland, as, many, former, slaves, had, done, douglass, set, sail, on, the, cambria, for, liverpool, england, on, august, 16, 1845, he, traveled, in, ireland, as, the, great, famine, was, beginning, the, feeling, of, freedom, from, american, racial, discrimination, amazed, douglass, eleven, days, and, a, half, gone, and, i, have, crossed, three, thousand, miles, of, the, perilous, deep, instead, of, a, democratic, government, i, am, under, a, monarchical, government, instead, of, the, bright, blue, sky, of, america, i, am, covered, with, the, soft, grey, fog, of, the, emerald, isle, i, breathe, and, lo, the, chattel, becomes, a, man, i, gaze, around, in, vain, for, one, who, will, question, my, equal, humanity, claim, me, as, his, slave, or, offer, me, an, insult, i, employ, a, cab, i, am, seated, beside, white, people, i, reach, the, hotel, i, enter, the, same, door, i, am, shown, into, the, same, parlor, i, dine, at, the, same, table, and, no, one, is, offended, i, find, myself, regarded, and, treated, at, every, turn, with, the, kindness, and, deference, paid, to, white, people, when, i, go, to, church, i, am, met, by, no, upturned, nose, and, scornful, lip, to, tell, me, we, don, t, allow, niggers, in, here, still, douglass, was, astounded, by, the, extreme, levels, of, poverty, he, encountered, in, dublin, much, of, it, reminding, him, of, his, experiences, in, slavery, in, a, letter, to, william, lloyd, garrison, douglass, wrote, i, see, much, here, to, remind, me, of, my, former, condition, and, i, confess, i, should, be, ashamed, to, lift, up, my, voice, against, american, slavery, but, that, i, know, the, cause, of, humanity, is, one, the, world, over, he, who, really, and, truly, feels, for, the, american, slave, cannot, steel, his, heart, to, the, woes, of, others, and, he, who, thinks, himself, an, abolitionist, yet, cannot, enter, into, the, wrongs, of, others, has, yet, to, find, a, true, foundation, for, his, anti, slavery, faith, he, also, met, and, befriended, the, irish, nationalist, and, strident, abolitionist, daniel, o, connell, who, was, to, be, a, great, inspiration, douglass, spent, two, years, in, ireland, and, great, britain, lecturing, in, churches, and, chapels, his, draw, was, such, that, some, facilities, were, crowded, to, suffocation, one, example, was, his, hugely, popular, london, reception, speech, which, douglass, delivered, in, may, 1846, at, alexander, fletcher, s, finsbury, chapel, douglass, remarked, that, in, england, he, was, treated, not, as, a, color, but, as, a, man, in, 1846, douglass, met, with, thomas, clarkson, one, of, the, last, living, british, abolitionists, who, had, persuaded, parliament, to, abolish, slavery, in, great, britain, s, colonies, during, this, trip, douglass, became, legally, free, as, british, supporters, led, by, anna, richardson, and, her, sister, in, law, ellen, of, newcastle, upon, tyne, raised, funds, to, buy, his, freedom, from, his, american, owner, thomas, auld, many, supporters, tried, to, encourage, douglass, to, remain, in, england, but, with, his, wife, still, in, massachusetts, and, three, million, of, his, black, brethren, in, bondage, in, the, united, states, he, returned, to, america, in, the, spring, of, 1847, soon, after, the, death, of, daniel, o, connell, in, the, 21st, century, historical, plaques, were, installed, on, buildings, in, cork, and, waterford, ireland, and, london, to, celebrate, douglass, s, visit, the, first, is, on, the, imperial, hotel, in, cork, and, was, unveiled, on, august, 31, 2012, the, second, is, on, the, fa, ade, of, waterford, city, hall, unveiled, on, october, 7, 2013, it, commemorates, his, speech, there, on, october, 9, 1845, the, third, plaque, adorns, nell, gwynn, house, south, kensington, in, london, at, the, site, of, an, earlier, house, where, douglass, stayed, with, the, british, abolitionist, george, thompson, on, july, 31, 2023, the, first, statue, of, him, in, europe, was, unveiled, in, high, street, in, belfast, douglass, spent, time, in, scotland, and, was, appointed, scotland, s, antislavery, agent, he, made, anti, slavery, speeches, and, wrote, letters, back, to, the, usa, he, considered, the, city, of, edinburgh, to, be, elegant, grand, and, very, welcoming, maps, of, the, places, in, the, city, that, were, important, to, his, stay, are, held, by, the, national, library, of, scotland, a, plaque, and, a, mural, on, gilmore, place, in, edinburgh, mark, his, stay, there, in, 1846, a, variety, of, collaborative, projects, are, currently, underway, to, commemorate, frederick, douglass, s, journey, and, visit, to, ireland, in, the, 19th, century, after, returning, to, the, u, s, in, 1847, using, 500, equivalent, to, 57, 716, in, 2023, given, to, him, by, english, supporters, douglass, started, publishing, his, first, abolitionist, newspaper, the, north, star, from, the, basement, of, the, memorial, ame, zion, church, in, rochester, new, york, originally, pittsburgh, journalist, martin, delany, was, co, editor, but, douglass, didn, t, feel, he, brought, in, enough, subscriptions, and, they, parted, ways, the, north, star, s, motto, was, right, is, of, no, sex, truth, is, of, no, color, god, is, the, father, of, us, all, and, we, are, all, brethren, the, ame, church, and, north, star, joined, in, the, freedmen, community, s, vigorous, opposition, to, the, mostly, white, american, colonization, society, and, its, proposal, to, send, free, black, people, to, africa, douglass, also, participated, in, the, underground, railroad, he, and, his, wife, provided, lodging, and, resources, in, their, home, to, more, than, four, hundred, fugitive, slaves, douglass, also, soon, split, with, garrison, whom, he, found, unwilling, to, support, actions, against, american, slavery, earlier, douglass, had, agreed, with, garrison, s, position, that, the, constitution, was, pro, slavery, because, of, the, three, fifths, clause, the, compromise, that, provided, that, 60, percent, of, the, number, of, enslaved, people, would, be, added, to, the, whole, number, of, free, persons, for, the, purpose, of, apportioning, congressional, seats, and, protection, of, the, international, slave, trade, through, 1807, garrison, had, burned, copies, of, the, constitution, to, express, his, opinion, however, lysander, spooner, published, the, unconstitutionality, of, slavery, 1846, which, examined, the, united, states, constitution, as, an, antislavery, document, douglass, s, change, of, opinion, about, the, constitution, and, his, splitting, from, garrison, around, 1847, became, one, of, the, abolitionist, movement, s, most, notable, divisions, douglass, angered, garrison, by, saying, that, the, constitution, could, and, should, be, used, as, an, instrument, in, the, fight, against, slavery, on, july, 24, 1851, shortly, after, his, announced, change, of, opinion, douglass, delivered, a, speech, titled, is, the, united, states, constitution, for, or, against, slavery, he, expressed, his, changed, views, again, in, an, 1860, speech, in, glasgow, scotland, titled, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, is, it, pro, slavery, or, anti, slavery, in, that, speech, he, said, when, i, escaped, from, slavery, and, was, introduced, to, the, garrisonians, i, adopted, very, many, of, their, opinions, i, was, young, had, read, but, little, and, naturally, took, some, things, on, trust, subsequent, reading, and, experience, however, brought, me, to, other, conclusions, he, now, believed, that, dissolution, of, the, american, union, which, garrison, advocated, would, place, the, slave, system, more, exclusively, under, the, control, of, the, slaveholding, states, in, addition, mr, garrison, and, his, friends, tell, us, that, while, in, the, union, we, are, responsible, for, slavery, i, deny, that, going, out, of, the, union, would, free, us, from, that, responsibility, the, american, people, in, the, northern, states, have, helped, to, enslave, the, black, people, their, duty, will, not, be, done, till, they, give, them, back, their, plundered, rights, in, september, 1848, on, the, tenth, anniversary, of, his, escape, douglass, published, an, open, letter, addressed, to, his, former, master, thomas, auld, berating, him, for, his, conduct, and, inquiring, after, members, of, his, family, still, held, by, auld, in, the, course, of, the, letter, douglass, adeptly, transitions, from, formal, and, restrained, to, familiar, and, then, to, impassioned, at, one, point, he, is, the, proud, parent, describing, his, improved, circumstances, and, the, progress, of, his, own, four, young, children, but, then, he, dramatically, shifts, tone, oh, sir, a, slaveholder, never, appears, to, me, so, completely, an, agent, of, hell, as, when, i, think, of, and, look, upon, my, dear, children, it, is, then, that, my, feelings, rise, above, my, control, the, grim, horrors, of, slavery, rise, in, all, their, ghastly, terror, before, me, the, wails, of, millions, pierce, my, heart, and, chill, my, blood, i, remember, the, chain, the, gag, the, bloody, whip, the, deathlike, gloom, overshadowing, the, broken, spirit, of, the, fettered, bondman, the, appalling, liability, of, his, being, torn, away, from, wife, and, children, and, sold, like, a, beast, in, the, market, in, a, graphic, passage, douglass, asked, auld, how, he, would, feel, if, douglass, had, come, to, take, away, his, daughter, amanda, into, slavery, treating, her, the, way, he, and, members, of, his, family, had, been, treated, by, auld, yet, in, his, conclusion, douglass, shows, his, focus, and, benevolence, stating, that, he, has, no, malice, towards, him, personally, and, asserts, that, there, is, no, roof, under, which, you, would, be, more, safe, than, mine, and, there, is, nothing, in, my, house, which, you, might, need, for, comfort, which, i, would, not, readily, grant, indeed, i, should, esteem, it, a, privilege, to, set, you, an, example, as, to, how, mankind, ought, to, treat, each, other, in, 1848, douglass, was, the, only, black, person, to, attend, the, seneca, falls, convention, the, first, women, s, rights, convention, in, upstate, new, york, elizabeth, cady, stanton, asked, the, assembly, to, pass, a, resolution, asking, for, women, s, suffrage, many, of, those, present, opposed, the, idea, including, influential, quakers, james, and, lucretia, mott, douglass, stood, and, spoke, eloquently, in, favor, of, women, s, suffrage, he, said, that, he, could, not, accept, the, right, to, vote, as, a, black, man, if, women, could, also, not, claim, that, right, he, suggested, that, the, world, would, be, a, better, place, if, women, were, involved, in, the, political, sphere, in, this, denial, of, the, right, to, participate, in, government, not, merely, the, degradation, of, woman, and, the, perpetuation, of, a, great, injustice, happens, but, the, maiming, and, repudiation, of, one, half, of, the, moral, and, intellectual, power, of, the, government, of, the, world, after, douglass, s, powerful, words, the, attendees, passed, the, resolution, in, the, wake, of, the, seneca, falls, convention, douglass, used, an, editorial, in, the, north, star, to, press, the, case, for, women, s, rights, he, recalled, the, marked, ability, and, dignity, of, the, proceedings, and, briefly, conveyed, several, arguments, of, the, convention, and, feminist, thought, at, the, time, on, the, first, count, douglass, acknowledged, the, decorum, of, the, participants, in, the, face, of, disagreement, in, the, remainder, he, discussed, the, primary, document, that, emerged, from, the, conference, a, declaration, of, sentiments, and, the, infant, feminist, cause, he, criticized, opponents, of, women, s, rights, a, discussion, of, the, rights, of, animals, would, be, regarded, with, far, more, complacency, by, many, of, what, are, called, the, wise, and, the, good, of, our, land, than, would, be, a, discussion, of, the, rights, of, woman, he, also, noted, the, link, between, abolitionism, and, feminism, the, overlap, between, the, communities, his, opinion, as, the, editor, of, a, prominent, newspaper, carried, weight, and, he, stated, the, position, of, the, north, star, explicitly, we, hold, woman, to, be, justly, entitled, to, all, we, claim, for, man, this, letter, written, a, week, after, the, convention, reaffirmed, the, first, part, of, the, paper, s, slogan, right, is, of, no, sex, after, the, civil, war, when, the, 15th, amendment, giving, black, men, the, right, to, vote, was, being, debated, douglass, split, with, the, stanton, led, faction, of, the, women, s, rights, movement, douglass, supported, the, amendment, which, would, grant, suffrage, to, black, men, stanton, opposed, the, 15th, amendment, because, it, limited, the, expansion, of, suffrage, to, black, men, she, predicted, its, passage, would, delay, for, decades, the, cause, for, women, s, right, to, vote, stanton, argued, that, american, women, and, black, men, should, band, together, to, fight, for, universal, suffrage, and, opposed, any, bill, that, split, the, issues, douglass, and, stanton, both, knew, that, there, was, not, yet, enough, male, support, for, women, s, right, to, vote, but, that, an, amendment, giving, black, men, the, vote, could, pass, in, the, late, 1860s, stanton, wanted, to, attach, women, s, suffrage, to, that, of, black, men, so, that, her, cause, would, be, carried, to, success, douglass, thought, such, a, strategy, was, too, risky, that, there, was, barely, enough, support, for, black, men, s, suffrage, he, feared, that, linking, the, cause, of, women, s, suffrage, to, that, of, black, men, would, result, in, failure, for, both, douglass, argued, that, white, women, already, empowered, by, their, social, connections, to, fathers, husbands, and, brothers, at, least, vicariously, had, the, vote, black, women, he, believed, would, have, the, same, degree, of, empowerment, as, white, women, once, black, men, had, the, vote, douglass, assured, the, american, women, that, at, no, time, had, he, ever, argued, against, women, s, right, to, vote, in, 1850, douglass, was, elected, the, vice, president, of, the, american, league, of, colored, laborers, the, first, black, labor, union, in, the, united, states, which, he, had, also, helped, found, meanwhile, in, 1851, he, merged, the, north, star, with, gerrit, smith, s, liberty, party, paper, to, form, frederick, douglass, paper, which, was, published, until, 1859, on, july, 5, 1852, douglass, delivered, an, address, in, corinthian, hall, at, a, meeting, organized, by, the, rochester, ladies, anti, slavery, society, this, speech, eventually, became, known, as, what, to, the, slave, is, the, fourth, of, july, one, biographer, called, it, perhaps, the, greatest, antislavery, oration, ever, given, in, 1853, he, was, a, prominent, attendee, of, the, radical, abolitionist, national, african, american, convention, in, rochester, douglass, was, one, of, five, people, whose, names, were, attached, to, the, address, of, the, convention, to, the, people, of, the, united, states, published, under, the, title, the, claims, of, our, common, cause, the, other, four, were, amos, no, freeman, james, monroe, whitfield, henry, o, wagoner, and, george, boyer, vashon, like, many, abolitionists, douglass, believed, that, education, would, be, crucial, for, african, americans, to, improve, their, lives, he, was, an, early, advocate, for, school, desegregation, in, the, 1850s, douglass, observed, that, new, york, s, facilities, and, instruction, for, african, american, children, were, vastly, inferior, to, those, for, european, americans, douglass, called, for, court, action, to, open, all, schools, to, all, children, he, said, that, full, inclusion, within, the, educational, system, was, a, more, pressing, need, for, african, americans, than, political, issues, such, as, suffrage, on, march, 12, 1859, douglass, met, with, radical, abolitionists, john, brown, george, debaptiste, and, others, at, william, webb, s, house, in, detroit, to, discuss, emancipation, douglass, met, brown, again, when, brown, visited, his, home, two, months, before, leading, the, raid, on, harpers, ferry, brown, penned, his, provisional, constitution, during, his, two, week, stay, with, douglass, also, staying, with, douglass, for, over, a, year, was, shields, green, a, fugitive, slave, whom, douglass, was, helping, as, he, often, did, shortly, before, the, raid, douglass, taking, green, with, him, travelled, from, rochester, via, new, york, city, to, chambersburg, pennsylvania, brown, s, communications, headquarters, he, was, recognized, there, by, black, people, who, asked, him, for, a, lecture, douglass, agreed, although, he, said, his, only, topic, was, slavery, green, joined, him, on, the, stage, brown, incognito, sat, in, the, audience, a, white, reporter, referring, to, nigger, democracy, called, it, a, flaming, address, by, the, notorious, negro, orator, there, in, an, abandoned, stone, quarry, for, secrecy, douglass, and, green, met, with, brown, and, john, henri, kagi, to, discuss, the, raid, after, discussions, lasting, as, douglass, put, it, a, day, and, a, night, he, disappointed, brown, by, declining, to, join, him, considering, the, mission, suicidal, to, douglass, s, surprise, green, went, with, brown, instead, of, returning, to, rochester, with, douglass, anne, brown, said, that, green, told, her, that, douglass, promised, to, pay, him, on, his, return, but, david, blight, called, this, much, more, ex, post, facto, bitterness, than, reality, almost, all, that, is, known, about, this, incident, comes, from, douglass, it, is, clear, that, it, was, of, immense, importance, to, him, both, as, a, turning, point, in, his, life, not, accompanying, john, brown, and, its, importance, in, his, public, image, the, meeting, was, not, revealed, by, douglass, for, 20, years, he, first, disclosed, it, in, his, speech, on, john, brown, at, storer, college, in, 1881, trying, unsuccessfully, to, raise, money, to, support, a, john, brown, professorship, at, storer, to, be, held, by, a, black, man, he, again, referred, to, it, stunningly, in, his, last, autobiography, after, the, raid, which, took, place, between, october, 16, and, 18, 1859, douglass, was, accused, both, of, supporting, brown, and, of, not, supporting, him, enough, he, was, nearly, arrested, on, a, virginia, warrant, and, fled, for, a, brief, time, to, canada, before, proceeding, onward, to, england, on, a, previously, planned, lecture, tour, arriving, near, the, end, of, november, during, his, lecture, tour, of, great, britain, on, march, 26, 1860, douglass, delivered, a, speech, before, the, scottish, anti, slavery, society, in, glasgow, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, is, it, pro, slavery, or, anti, slavery, outlining, his, views, on, the, american, constitution, that, month, on, the, 13th, douglass, s, youngest, daughter, annie, died, in, rochester, new, york, just, days, shy, of, her, 11th, birthday, douglass, sailed, back, from, england, the, following, month, traveling, through, canada, to,

execution, hunter, congratulated, douglass, douglass, considered, photography, very, important, in, ending, slavery, and, racism, and, believed, that, the, camera, would, not, lie, even, in, the, hands, of, a, racist, white, person, as, photographs, were, an, excellent, counter, to, many, racist, caricatures, particularly, in, blackface, minstrelsy, he, was, the, most, photographed, american, of, the, 19th, century, consciously, using, photography, to, advance, his, political, views, he, never, smiled, specifically, so, as, not, to, play, into, the, racist, caricature, of, a, happy, enslaved, person, he, tended, to, look, directly, into, the, camera, and, confront, the, viewer, with, a, stern, look, by, the, time, of, the, civil, war, douglass, was, one, of, the, most, famous, black, men, in, the, country, known, for, his, orations, on, the, condition, of, the, black, race, and, on, other, issues, such, as, women, s, rights, his, eloquence, gathered, crowds, at, every, location, his, reception, by, leaders, in, england, and, ireland, added, to, his, stature, he, had, been, seriously, proposed, for, the, congressional, seat, of, his, friend, and, supporter, gerrit, smith, who, declined, to, run, again, after, his, term, ended, in, 1854, smith, recommended, to, him, that, he, not, run, because, there, were, strenuous, objections, from, members, of, congress, the, possibility, afflicted, some, with, convulsions, others, with, panic, more, with, an, astonishing, flow, of, exceedingly, select, and, nervous, language, giving, vent, to, all, sorts, of, linguistic, enormities, if, the, house, agreed, to, seat, him, which, was, unlikely, all, the, southern, members, would, walk, out, so, the, country, would, finally, be, split, no, black, person, would, serve, in, congress, until, 1870, just, after, the, passage, of, the, fifteenth, amendment, douglass, and, the, abolitionists, argued, that, because, the, aim, of, the, civil, war, was, to, end, slavery, african, americans, should, be, allowed, to, engage, in, the, fight, for, their, freedom, douglass, publicized, this, view, in, his, newspapers, and, several, speeches, after, lincoln, had, finally, allowed, black, soldiers, to, serve, in, the, union, army, douglass, helped, the, recruitment, efforts, publishing, his, famous, broadside, men, of, color, to, arms, on, march, 21, 1863, his, eldest,

s, emancipation, proclamation, which, took, effect, on, january, 1, 1863, declared, the, freedom, of, all, slaves, in, confederate, held, territory, slaves, in, union, held, areas, were, not, covered, because, the, proclamation, was, permissible, under, the, constitution, only, as, a, war, measure, they, were, freed, with, the, adoption, of, the, 13th, amendment, on, december, 6, 1865, douglass, described, the, spirit, of, those, awaiting, the, proclamation, we, were, waiting, and, listening, as, for, a, bolt, from, the, sky, we, were, watching, by, the, dim, light, of, the, stars, for, the, dawn, of, a, new, day, we, were, longing, for, the, answer, to, the, agonizing, prayers, of, centuries, during, the, u, s, presidential, election, of, 1864, douglass, supported, john, c, fr, mont, who, was, the, candidate, of, the, abolitionist, radical, democracy, party, douglass, was, disappointed, that, president, lincoln, did, not, publicly, endorse, suffrage, for, black, freedmen, douglass, believed, that, since, african, american, men, were, fighting, for, the, union, in, the, american, civil, war, they, deserved, the, right, to, vote, the, postwar, ratification, of, the, 13th, amendment, on, december, 6, 1865, outlawed, slavery, except, as, a, punishment, for, crime, the, 14th, amendment, provided, for, birthright, citizenship, and, prohibited, the, states, from,

subject, of, black, suffrage, on, april, 14, 1876, douglass, delivered, the, keynote, speech, at, the, unveiling, of, the, emancipation, memorial, in, washington, s, lincoln, park, he, spoke, frankly, about, the, complex, legacy, of, lincoln, noting, what, he, perceived, as, both, positive, and, negative, attributes, of, the, late, president, calling, lincoln, the, white, man, s, president, douglass, criticized, lincoln, s, tardiness, in, joining, the, cause, of, emancipation, noting, that, lincoln, initially, opposed, the, expansion, of, slavery, but, did, not, support, its, elimination, he, had, been, ready, and, willing, at, any, time, during, the, first, years, of, his, administration, to, deny, postpone, and, sacrifice, the, humanity, of, the, colored, people, to, promote, the, welfare, of, the, white, people, lincoln, was, neither, our, man, or, our, model, but, douglass, also, asked, can, any, colored, man, or, any, white, man, friendly, to, the, freedom, of, all, men, ever, forget, the, night, which, followed, the, first, day, of, january, 1863, when, the, world, was, to, see, if, abraham, lincoln, would, prove, to, be, as, good, as, his, word, he, also, said, though, mr, lincoln, shared, the, prejudices, of, his, white, fellow, countrymen, against, the, negro, it, is, hardly, necessary, to, say, that, in, his, heart, of, hearts, he, loathed, and, hated, slavery, most, famously, he, added, viewed, from, the, genuine, abolition, ground, mr, lincoln, seemed, tardy, cold, dull, and, indifferent, but, measuring, him, by, the, sentiment, of, his, country, a, sentiment, he, was, bound, as, a, statesman, to, consult, he, was, swift, zealous, radical, and, determined, the, crowd, roused, by, his, speech, gave, douglass, a, standing, ovation, lincoln, s, widow, mary, lincoln, supposedly, gave, lincoln, s, favorite, walking, stick, to, douglass, in, appreciation, that, walking, stick, still, rests, in, his, final, residence, cedar, hill, in, washington, d, c, now, preserved, as, the, frederick, douglass, national, historic, site, after, delivering, the, speech, douglass, immediately, wrote, to, the, national, republican, newspaper, in, washington, which, published, his, letter, five, days, later, on, april, 19, criticizing, the, statue, s, design, and, suggesting, the, park, could, be, improved, by, more, dignified, monuments, of, free, black, people, the, negro, here, though, rising, is, still, on, his, knees, and, nude, douglass, wrote, what, i, want, to, see, before, i, die, is, a, monument, representing, the, negro, not, couchant, on, his, knees, like, a, four, footed, animal, but, erect, on, his, feet, like, a, man, after, the, civil, war, douglass, continued, to, work, for, equality, for, african, americans,
