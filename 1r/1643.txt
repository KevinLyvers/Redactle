tsung, dao, lee, chinese, pinyin, l, zh, ngd, o, november, 24, 1926, august, 4, 2024, was, a, chinese, american, physicist, known, for, his, work, on, parity, violation, the, lee, yang, theorem, particle, physics, relativistic, heavy, ion, rhic, physics, nontopological, solitons, and, soliton, stars, he, was, a, university, professor, emeritus, at, columbia, university, in, new, york, city, where, he, taught, from, 1953, until, his, retirement, in, 2012, in, 1957, at, the, age, of, 30, lee, won, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, chen, ning, yang, for, their, work, on, the, violation, of, the, parity, law, in, weak, interactions, which, chien, shiung, wu, experimentally, proved, from, 1956, to, 1957, with, her, well, known, wu, experiment, lee, remains, the, youngest, nobel, laureate, in, the, science, fields, after, world, war, ii, he, is, the, third, youngest, nobel, laureate, in, sciences, in, history, after, william, l, bragg, who, won, the, prize, at, 25, with, his, father, william, h, bragg, in, 1915, and, werner, heisenberg, who, won, in, 1932, also, at, 30, lee, and, yang, were, the, first, chinese, laureates, since, he, became, a, naturalized, american, citizen, in, 1962, lee, is, also, the, youngest, american, ever, to, have, won, a, nobel, prize, lee, was, born, in, shanghai, china, with, his, ancestral, home, in, nearby, suzhou, his, father, chun, kang, lee, l, j, n, k, ng, one, of, the, first, graduates, of, the, university, of, nanking, was, a, chemical, industrialist, and, merchant, who, was, involved, in, china, s, early, development, of, modern, synthesized, fertilizer, lee, s, grandfather, chong, tan, lee, l, zh, ng, t, n, was, the, first, chinese, methodist, episcopal, senior, pastor, of, st, john, s, church, in, suzhou, lee, has, four, brothers, and, one, sister, educator, robert, c, t, lee, was, one, of, t, d, s, brothers, lee, s, mother, chang, and, brother, robert, c, t, moved, to, taiwan, in, the, 1950s, lee, received, his, secondary, education, in, shanghai, high, school, affiliated, to, soochow, university, and, jiangxi, jiangxi, joint, high, school, due, to, the, second, sino, japanese, war, lee, s, high, school, education, was, interrupted, thus, he, did, not, obtain, his, secondary, diploma, nevertheless, in, 1943, lee, directly, applied, to, and, was, admitted, by, the, national, chekiang, university, now, zhejiang, university, initially, lee, registered, as, a, student, in, the, department, of, chemical, engineering, very, quickly, lee, s, talent, was, discovered, and, his, interest, in, physics, grew, rapidly, several, physics, professors, including, shu, xingbei, and, wang, ganchang, largely, guided, lee, and, he, soon, transferred, into, the, department, of, physics, of, national, che, kiang, university, where, he, studied, in, 1943, 1944, however, again, disrupted, by, a, further, japanese, invasion, lee, continued, at, the, national, southwestern, associated, university, in, kunming, the, next, year, in, 1945, where, he, studied, with, professor, wu, ta, you, professor, wu, nominated, lee, for, a, chinese, government, fellowship, for, graduate, study, in, the, united, states, in, 1946, lee, went, to, the, university, of, chicago, and, was, selected, by, professor, enrico, fermi, to, become, his, phd, student, lee, received, his, phd, under, fermi, in, 1950, for, his, research, work, hydrogen, content, of, white, dwarf, stars, lee, served, as, research, associate, and, lecturer, in, physics, at, the, university, of, california, at, berkeley, from, 1950, to, 1951, in, 1953, lee, joined, columbia, university, where, he, remained, until, retirement, his, first, work, at, columbia, was, on, a, solvable, model, of, quantum, field, theory, better, known, as, the, lee, model, soon, his, focus, turned, to, particle, physics, and, the, developing, puzzle, of, k, meson, decays, lee, realized, in, early, 1956, that, the, key, to, the, puzzle, was, parity, non, conservation, at, lee, s, suggestion, the, first, experimental, test, was, on, hyperon, decay, by, the, steinberger, group, at, that, time, the, experimental, result, gave, only, an, indication, of, a, 2, standard, deviation, effect, of, possible, parity, violation, encouraged, by, this, feasibility, study, lee, made, a, systematic, study, of, possible, time, reversal, t, parity, p, charge, conjugation, c, and, cp, violations, in, weak, interactions, with, collaborators, including, c, n, yang, after, the, definitive, experimental, confirmation, by, chien, shiung, wu, and, her, assistants, that, showed, that, parity, was, not, conserved, lee, and, yang, were, awarded, the, 1957, nobel, prize, in, physics, unfortunately, wu, was, not, awarded, the, nobel, prize, which, is, considered, one, of, the, largest, controversies, in, nobel, committee, history, in, the, early, 1960s, lee, and, collaborators, initiated, the, important, field, of, high, energy, neutrino, physics, in, 1964, lee, with, m, nauenberg, analyzed, the, divergences, connected, with, particles, of, zero, rest, mass, and, described, a, general, method, known, as, the, kln, theorem, for, dealing, with, these, divergences, which, still, plays, an, important, role, in, contemporary, work, in, qcd, with, its, massless, self, interacting, gluons, in, 1974, 75, lee, published, several, papers, on, a, new, form, of, matter, in, high, density, which, led, to, the, modern, field, of, rhic, physics, now, dominating, the, entire, high, energy, nuclear, physics, field, besides, particle, physics, lee, was, active, in, statistical, mechanics, astrophysics, hydrodynamics, many, body, system, solid, state, and, lattice, qcd, in, 1983, lee, wrote, a, paper, entitled, can, time, be, a, discrete, dynamical, variable, which, led, to, a, series, of, publications, by, lee, and, collaborators, on, the, formulation, of, fundamental, physics, in, terms, of, difference, equations, but, with, exact, invariance, under, continuous, groups, of, translational, and, rotational, transformations, beginning, in, 1975, lee, and, collaborators, established, the, field, of, non, topological, solitons, which, led, to, his, work, on, soliton, stars, and, black, holes, throughout, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, from, 1997, to, 2003, lee, was, director, of, the, riken, bnl, research, center, now, director, emeritus, which, together, with, other, researchers, from, columbia, completed, a, 1, teraflops, supercomputer, qcdsp, for, lattice, qcd, in, 1998, and, a, 10, teraflops, qcdoc, machine, in, 2001, most, recently, lee, and, richard, m, friedberg, developed, a, new, method, to, solve, the, schr, dinger, equation, leading, to, convergent, iterative, solutions, for, the, long, standing, quantum, degenerate, double, wall, potential, and, other, instanton, problems, they, also, did, work, on, the, neutrino, mapping, matrix, lee, was, one, of, the, 20, american, recipients, of, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, to, sign, a, letter, addressed, to, president, george, w, bush, in, may, 2008, urging, him, to, reverse, the, damage, done, to, basic, science, research, in, the, fiscal, year, 2008, omnibus, appropriations, bill, by, requesting, additional, emergency, funding, for, the, department, of, energy, s, office, of, science, the, national, science, foundation, and, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, soon, after, the, re, establishment, of, china, american, relations, with, the, prc, lee, and, his, wife, jeannette, hui, chun, chin, q, n, hu, j, n, were, able, to, go, to, the, prc, where, lee, gave, a, series, of, lectures, and, seminars, and, organized, the, cuspea, china, u, s, physics, examination, and, application, in, 1998, lee, established, the, chun, tsung, endowment, in, memory, of, his, wife, who, had, died, three, years, earlier, the, chun, tsung, scholarships, supervised, by, the, united, board, for, christian, higher, education, in, asia, new, york, are, awarded, to, undergraduates, usually, in, their, 2nd, or, 3rd, year, at, six, universities, which, are, shanghai, jiaotong, university, fudan, university, lanzhou, university, soochow, university, peking, university, and, tsinghua, university, students, selected, for, such, scholarships, are, named, chun, tsung, scholars, lee, and, jeannette, hui, chun, chin, married, in, 1950, and, had, two, sons, james, lee, chinese, pinyin, l, zh, ngq, ng, and, stephen, lee, chinese, pinyin, l, zh, ngh, n, his, wife, died, in, 1996, tsung, dao, lee, died, in, san, francisco, on, august, 4, 2024, at, the, age,
