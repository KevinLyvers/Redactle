jules, henri, poincar, uk, p, w, k, r, e, us, p, w, k, r, e, french, 29, april, 1854, 17, july, 1912, was, a, french, mathematician, theoretical, physicist, engineer, and, philosopher, of, science, he, is, often, described, as, a, polymath, and, in, mathematics, as, the, last, universalist, since, he, excelled, in, all, fields, of, the, discipline, as, it, existed, during, his, lifetime, due, to, his, scientific, success, influence, and, his, discoveries, he, has, been, deemed, the, philosopher, par, excellence, of, modern, science, as, a, mathematician, and, physicist, he, made, many, original, fundamental, contributions, to, pure, and, applied, mathematics, mathematical, physics, and, celestial, mechanics, in, his, research, on, the, three, body, problem, poincar, became, the, first, person, to, discover, a, chaotic, deterministic, system, which, laid, the, foundations, of, modern, chaos, theory, he, is, also, considered, to, be, one, of, the, founders, of, the, field, of, topology, poincar, made, clear, the, importance, of, paying, attention, to, the, invariance, of, laws, of, physics, under, different, transformations, and, was, the, first, to, present, the, lorentz, transformations, in, their, modern, symmetrical, form, poincar, discovered, the, remaining, relativistic, velocity, transformations, and, recorded, them, in, a, letter, to, hendrik, lorentz, in, 1905, thus, he, obtained, perfect, invariance, of, all, of, maxwell, s, equations, an, important, step, in, the, formulation, of, the, theory, of, special, relativity, in, 1905, poincar, first, proposed, gravitational, waves, ondes, gravifiques, emanating, from, a, body, and, propagating, at, the, speed, of, light, as, being, required, by, the, lorentz, transformations, in, 1912, he, wrote, an, influential, paper, which, provided, a, mathematical, argument, for, quantum, mechanics, the, poincar, group, used, in, physics, and, mathematics, was, named, after, him, early, in, the, 20th, century, he, formulated, the, poincar, conjecture, which, became, over, time, one, of, the, famous, unsolved, problems, in, mathematics, it, was, solved, in, 2002, 2003, by, grigori, perelman, poincar, was, born, on, 29, april, 1854, in, cit, ducale, neighborhood, nancy, meurthe, et, moselle, into, an, influential, french, family, his, father, l, on, poincar, 1828, 1892, was, a, professor, of, medicine, at, the, university, of, nancy, his, younger, sister, aline, married, the, spiritual, philosopher, mile, boutroux, another, notable, member, of, henri, s, family, was, his, cousin, raymond, poincar, a, fellow, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, who, was, president, of, france, from, 1913, to, 1920, and, three, time, prime, minister, of, france, between, 1913, and, 1929, during, his, childhood, he, was, seriously, ill, for, a, time, with, diphtheria, and, received, special, instruction, from, his, mother, eug, nie, launois, 1830, 1897, in, 1862, henri, entered, the, lyc, e, in, nancy, now, renamed, the, lyc, e, henri, poincar, in, his, honour, along, with, henri, poincar, university, also, in, nancy, he, spent, eleven, years, at, the, lyc, e, and, during, this, time, he, proved, to, be, one, of, the, top, students, in, every, topic, he, studied, he, excelled, in, written, composition, his, mathematics, teacher, described, him, as, a, monster, of, mathematics, and, he, won, first, prizes, in, the, concours, g, n, ral, a, competition, between, the, top, pupils, from, all, the, lyc, es, across, france, his, poorest, subjects, were, music, and, physical, education, where, he, was, described, as, average, at, best, however, poor, eyesight, and, a, tendency, towards, absentmindedness, may, explain, these, difficulties, he, graduated, from, the, lyc, e, in, 1871, with, a, baccalaur, at, in, both, letters, and, sciences, during, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, he, served, alongside, his, father, in, the, ambulance, corps, poincar, entered, the, cole, polytechnique, as, the, top, qualifier, in, 1873, and, graduated, in, 1875, there, he, studied, mathematics, as, a, student, of, charles, hermite, continuing, to, excel, and, publishing, his, first, paper, d, monstration, nouvelle, des, propri, t, s, de, l, indicatrice, d, une, surface, in, 1874, from, november, 1875, to, june, 1878, he, studied, at, the, cole, des, mines, while, continuing, the, study, of, mathematics, in, addition, to, the, mining, engineering, syllabus, and, received, the, degree, of, ordinary, mining, engineer, in, march, 1879, as, a, graduate, of, the, cole, des, mines, he, joined, the, corps, des, mines, as, an, inspector, for, the, vesoul, region, in, northeast, france, he, was, on, the, scene, of, a, mining, disaster, at, magny, in, august, 1879, in, which, 18, miners, died, he, carried, out, the, official, investigation, into, the, accident, in, a, characteristically, thorough, and, humane, way, at, the, same, time, poincar, was, preparing, for, his, doctorate, in, science, in, mathematics, under, the, supervision, of, charles, hermite, his, doctoral, thesis, was, in, the, field, of, differential, equations, it, was, named, sur, les, propri, t, s, des, fonctions, d, finies, par, les, quations, aux, diff, rences, partielles, poincar, devised, a, new, way, of, studying, the, properties, of, these, equations, he, not, only, faced, the, question, of, determining, the, integral, of, such, equations, but, also, was, the, first, person, to, study, their, general, geometric, properties, he, realised, that, they, could, be, used, to, model, the, behaviour, of, multiple, bodies, in, free, motion, within, the, solar, system, poincar, graduated, from, the, university, of, paris, in, 1879, after, receiving, his, degree, poincar, began, teaching, as, junior, lecturer, in, mathematics, at, the, university, of, caen, in, normandy, in, december, 1879, at, the, same, time, he, published, his, first, major, article, concerning, the, treatment, of, a, class, of, automorphic, functions, there, in, caen, he, met, his, future, wife, louise, poulain, d, andecy, 1857, 1934, granddaughter, of, isidore, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, and, great, granddaughter, of, tienne, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, and, on, 20, april, 1881, they, married, together, they, had, four, children, jeanne, born, 1887, yvonne, born, 1889, henriette, born, 1891, and, l, on, born, 1893, poincar, immediately, established, himself, among, the, greatest, mathematicians, of, europe, attracting, the, attention, of, many, prominent, mathematicians, in, 1881, poincar, was, invited, to, take, a, teaching, position, at, the, faculty, of, sciences, of, the, university, of, paris, he, accepted, the, invitation, during, the, years, 1883, to, 1897, he, taught, mathematical, analysis, in, the, cole, polytechnique, in, 1881, 1882, poincar, created, a, new, branch, of, mathematics, qualitative, theory, of, differential, equations, he, showed, how, it, is, possible, to, derive, the, most, important, information, about, the, behavior, of, a, family, of, solutions, without, having, to, solve, the, equation, since, this, may, not, always, be, possible, he, successfully, used, this, approach, to, problems, in, celestial, mechanics, and, mathematical, physics, he, never, fully, abandoned, his, career, in, the, mining, administration, to, mathematics, he, worked, at, the, ministry, of, public, services, as, an, engineer, in, charge, of, northern, railway, development, from, 1881, to, 1885, he, eventually, became, chief, engineer, of, the, corps, des, mines, in, 1893, and, inspector, general, in, 1910, beginning, in, 1881, and, for, the, rest, of, his, career, he, taught, at, the, university, of, paris, the, sorbonne, he, was, initially, appointed, as, the, ma, tre, de, conf, rences, d, analyse, associate, professor, of, analysis, eventually, he, held, the, chairs, of, physical, and, experimental, mechanics, mathematical, physics, and, theory, of, probability, and, celestial, mechanics, and, astronomy, in, 1887, at, the, young, age, of, 32, poincar, was, elected, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, he, became, its, president, in, 1906, and, was, elected, to, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, on, 5, march, 1908, in, 1887, he, won, oscar, ii, king, of, sweden, s, mathematical, competition, for, a, resolution, of, the, three, body, problem, concerning, the, free, motion, of, multiple, orbiting, bodies, see, three, body, problem, section, below, in, 1893, poincar, joined, the, french, bureau, des, longitudes, which, engaged, him, in, the, synchronisation, of, time, around, the, world, in, 1897, poincar, backed, an, unsuccessful, proposal, for, the, decimalisation, of, circular, measure, and, hence, time, and, longitude, it, was, this, post, which, led, him, to, consider, the, question, of, establishing, international, time, zones, and, the, synchronisation, of, time, between, bodies, in, relative, motion, see, work, on, relativity, section, below, in, 1904, he, intervened, in, the, trials, of, alfred, dreyfus, attacking, the, spurious, scientific, claims, regarding, evidence, brought, against, dreyfus, poincar, was, the, president, of, the, soci, t, astronomique, de, france, saf, the, french, astronomical, society, from, 1901, to, 1903, poincar, had, two, notable, doctoral, students, at, the, university, of, paris, louis, bachelier, 1900, and, dimitrie, pompeiu, 1905, in, 1912, poincar, underwent, surgery, for, a, prostate, problem, and, subsequently, died, from, an, embolism, on, 17, july, 1912, in, paris, he, was, 58, years, of, age, he, is, buried, in, the, poincar, family, vault, in, the, cemetery, of, montparnasse, paris, in, section, 16, close, to, the, gate, rue, mile, richard, a, former, french, minister, of, education, claude, all, gre, proposed, in, 2004, that, poincar, be, reburied, in, the, panth, on, in, paris, which, is, reserved, for, french, citizens, of, the, highest, honour, poincar, made, many, contributions, to, different, fields, of, pure, and, applied, mathematics, such, as, celestial, mechanics, fluid, mechanics, optics, electricity, telegraphy, capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, potential, theory, quantum, theory, theory, of, relativity, and, physical, cosmology, he, was, also, a, populariser, of, mathematics, and, physics, and, wrote, several, books, for, the, lay, public, among, the, specific, topics, he, contributed, to, are, the, following, the, problem, of, finding, the, general, solution, to, the, motion, of, more, than, two, orbiting, bodies, in, the, solar, system, had, eluded, mathematicians, since, newton, s, time, this, was, known, originally, as, the, three, body, problem, and, later, the, n, body, problem, where, n, is, any, number, of, more, than, two, orbiting, bodies, the, n, body, solution, was, considered, very, important, and, challenging, at, the, close, of, the, 19th, century, indeed, in, 1887, in, honour, of, his, 60th, birthday, oscar, ii, king, of, sweden, advised, by, g, sta, mittag, leffler, established, a, prize, for, anyone, who, could, find, the, solution, to, the, problem, the, announcement, was, quite, specific, given, a, system, of, arbitrarily, many, mass, points, that, attract, each, according, to, newton, s, law, under, the, assumption, that, no, two, points, ever, collide, try, to, find, a, representation, of, the, coordinates, of, each, point, as, a, series, in, a, variable, that, is, some, known, function, of, time, and, for, all, of, whose, values, the, series, converges, uniformly, in, case, the, problem, could, not, be, solved, any, other, important, contribution, to, classical, mechanics, would, then, be, considered, to, be, prizeworthy, the, prize, was, finally, awarded, to, poincar, even, though, he, did, not, solve, the, original, problem, one, of, the, judges, the, distinguished, karl, weierstrass, said, this, work, cannot, indeed, be, considered, as, furnishing, the, complete, solution, of, the, question, proposed, but, that, it, is, nevertheless, of, such, importance, that, its, publication, will, inaugurate, a, new, era, in, the, history, of, celestial, mechanics, the, first, version, of, his, contribution, even, contained, a, serious, error, for, details, see, the, article, by, diacu, and, the, book, by, barrow, green, the, version, finally, printed, contained, many, important, ideas, which, led, to, the, theory, of, chaos, the, problem, as, stated, originally, was, finally, solved, by, karl, f, sundman, for, n, 3, in, 1912, and, was, generalised, to, the, case, of, n, 3, bodies, by, qiudong, wang, in, the, 1990s, the, series, solutions, have, very, slow, convergence, it, would, take, millions, of, terms, to, determine, the, motion, of, the, particles, for, even, very, short, intervals, of, time, so, they, are, unusable, in, numerical, work, poincar, s, work, at, the, bureau, des, longitudes, on, establishing, international, time, zones, led, him, to, consider, how, clocks, at, rest, on, the, earth, which, would, be, moving, at, different, speeds, relative, to, absolute, space, or, the, luminiferous, aether, could, be, synchronised, at, the, same, time, dutch, theorist, hendrik, lorentz, was, developing, maxwell, s, theory, into, a, theory, of, the, motion, of, charged, particles, electrons, or, ions, and, their, interaction, with, radiation, in, 1895, lorentz, had, introduced, an, auxiliary, quantity, without, physical, interpretation, called, local, time, t, t, v, x, c, 2, displaystyle, t, prime, t, vx, c, 2, and, introduced, the, hypothesis, of, length, contraction, to, explain, the, failure, of, optical, and, electrical, experiments, to, detect, motion, relative, to, the, aether, see, michelson, morley, experiment, poincar, was, a, constant, interpreter, and, sometimes, friendly, critic, of, lorentz, s, theory, poincar, as, a, philosopher, was, interested, in, the, deeper, meaning, thus, he, interpreted, lorentz, s, theory, and, in, so, doing, he, came, up, with, many, insights, that, are, now, associated, with, special, relativity, in, the, measure, of, time, 1898, poincar, said, a, little, reflection, is, sufficient, to, understand, that, all, these, affirmations, have, by, themselves, no, meaning, they, can, have, one, only, as, the, result, of, a, convention, he, also, argued, that, scientists, have, to, set, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, as, a, postulate, to, give, physical, theories, the, simplest, form, based, on, these, assumptions, he, discussed, in, 1900, lorentz, s, wonderful, invention, of, local, time, and, remarked, that, it, arose, when, moving, clocks, are, synchronised, by, exchanging, light, signals, assumed, to, travel, with, the, same, speed, in, both, directions, in, a, moving, frame, in, 1881, poincar, described, hyperbolic, geometry, in, terms, of, the, hyperboloid, model, formulating, transformations, leaving, invariant, the, lorentz, interval, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, 1, displaystyle, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, 1, which, makes, them, mathematically, equivalent, to, the, lorentz, transformations, in, 2, 1, dimensions, in, addition, poincar, s, other, models, of, hyperbolic, geometry, poincar, disk, model, poincar, half, plane, model, as, well, as, the, beltrami, klein, model, can, be, related, to, the, relativistic, velocity, space, see, gyrovector, space, in, 1892, poincar, developed, a, mathematical, theory, of, light, including, polarization, his, vision, of, the, action, of, polarizers, and, retarders, acting, on, a, sphere, representing, polarized, states, is, called, the, poincar, sphere, it, was, shown, that, the, poincar, sphere, possesses, an, underlying, lorentzian, symmetry, by, which, it, can, be, used, as, a, geometrical, representation, of, lorentz, transformations, and, velocity, additions, he, discussed, the, principle, of, relative, motion, in, two, papers, in, 1900, and, named, it, the, principle, of, relativity, in, 1904, according, to, which, no, physical, experiment, can, discriminate, between, a, state, of, uniform, motion, and, a, state, of, rest, in, 1905, poincar, wrote, to, lorentz, about, lorentz, s, paper, of, 1904, which, poincar, described, as, a, paper, of, supreme, importance, in, this, letter, he, pointed, out, an, error, lorentz, had, made, when, he, had, applied, his, transformation, to, one, of, maxwell, s, equations, that, for, charge, occupied, space, and, also, questioned, the, time, dilation, factor, given, by, lorentz, in, a, second, letter, to, lorentz, poincar, gave, his, own, reason, why, lorentz, s, time, dilation, factor, was, indeed, correct, after, all, it, was, necessary, to, make, the, lorentz, transformation, form, a, group, and, he, gave, what, is, now, known, as, the, relativistic, velocity, addition, law, poincar, later, delivered, a, paper, at, the, meeting, of, the, academy, of, sciences, in, paris, on, 5, june, 1905, in, which, these, issues, were, addressed, in, the, published, version, of, that, he, wrote, the, essential, point, established, by, lorentz, is, that, the, equations, of, the, electromagnetic, field, are, not, altered, by, a, certain, transformation, which, i, will, call, by, the, name, of, lorentz, of, the, form, and, showed, that, the, arbitrary, function, displaystyle, ell, left, varepsilon, right, must, be, unity, for, all, displaystyle, varepsilon, lorentz, had, set, 1, displaystyle, ell, 1, by, a, different, argument, to, make, the, transformations, form, a, group, in, an, enlarged, version, of, the, paper, that, appeared, in, 1906, poincar, pointed, out, that, the, combination, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, c, 2, t, 2, displaystyle, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, c, 2, t, 2, is, invariant, he, noted, that, a, lorentz, transformation, is, merely, a, rotation, in, four, dimensional, space, about, the, origin, by, introducing, c, t, 1, displaystyle, ct, sqrt, 1, as, a, fourth, imaginary, coordinate, and, he, used, an, early, form, of, four, vectors, poincar, expressed, a, lack, of, interest, in, a, four, dimensional, reformulation, of, his, new, mechanics, in, 1907, because, in, his, opinion, the, translation, of, physics, into, the, language, of, four, dimensional, geometry, would, entail, too, much, effort, for, limited, profit, so, it, was, hermann, minkowski, who, worked, out, the, consequences, of, this, notion, in, 1907, like, others, before, poincar, 1900, discovered, a, relation, between, mass, and, electromagnetic, energy, while, studying, the, conflict, between, the, action, reaction, principle, and, lorentz, ether, theory, he, tried, to, determine, whether, the, center, of, gravity, still, moves, with, a, uniform, velocity, when, electromagnetic, fields, are, included, he, noticed, that, the, action, reaction, principle, does, not, hold, for, matter, alone, but, that, the, electromagnetic, field, has, its, own, momentum, poincar, concluded, that, the, electromagnetic, field, energy, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, behaves, like, a, fictitious, fluid, fluide, fictif, with, a, mass, density, of, e, c, 2, if, the, center, of, mass, frame, is, defined, by, both, the, mass, of, matter, and, the, mass, of, the, fictitious, fluid, and, if, the, fictitious, fluid, is, indestructible, it, s, neither, created, or, destroyed, then, the, motion, of, the, center, of, mass, frame, remains, uniform, but, electromagnetic, energy, can, be, converted, into, other, forms, of, energy, so, poincar, assumed, that, there, exists, a, non, electric, energy, fluid, at, each, point, of, space, into, which, electromagnetic, energy, can, be, transformed, and, which, also, carries, a, mass, proportional, to, the, energy, in, this, way, the, motion, of, the, center, of, mass, remains, uniform, poincar, said, that, one, should, not, be, too, surprised, by, these, assumptions, since, they, are, only, mathematical, fictions, however, poincar, s, resolution, led, to, a, paradox, when, changing, frames, if, a, hertzian, oscillator, radiates, in, a, certain, direction, it, will, suffer, a, recoil, from, the, inertia, of, the, fictitious, fluid, poincar, performed, a, lorentz, boost, to, order, v, c, to, the, frame, of, the, moving, source, he, noted, that, energy, conservation, holds, in, both, frames, but, that, the, law, of, conservation, of, momentum, is, violated, this, would, allow, perpetual, motion, a, notion, which, he, abhorred, the, laws, of, nature, would, have, to, be, different, in, the, frames, of, reference, and, the, relativity, principle, would, not, hold, therefore, he, argued, that, also, in, this, case, there, has, to, be, another, compensating, mechanism, in, the, ether, poincar, himself, came, back, to, this, topic, in, his, st, louis, lecture, 1904, he, rejected, the, possibility, that, energy, carries, mass, and, criticized, his, own, solution, to, compensate, the, above, mentioned, problems, the, apparatus, will, recoil, as, if, it, were, a, cannon, and, the, projected, energy, a, ball, and, that, contradicts, the, principle, of, newton, since, our, present, projectile, has, no, mass, it, is, not, matter, it, is, energy, shall, we, say, that, the, space, which, separates, the, oscillator, from, the, receiver, and, which, the, disturbance, must, traverse, in, passing, from, one, to, the, other, is, not, empty, but, is, filled, not, only, with, ether, but, with, air, or, even, in, inter, planetary, space, with, some, subtile, yet, ponderable, fluid, that, this, matter, receives, the, shock, as, does, the, receiver, at, the, moment, the, energy, reaches, it, and, recoils, when, the, disturbance, leaves, it, that, would, save, newton, s, principle, but, it, is, not, true, if, the, energy, during, its, propagation, remained, always, attached, to, some, material, substratum, this, matter, would, carry, the, light, along, with, it, and, fizeau, has, shown, at, least, for, the, air, that, there, is, nothing, of, the, kind, michelson, and, morley, have, since, confirmed, this, we, might, also, suppose, that, the, motions, of, matter, proper, were, exactly, compensated, by, those, of, the, ether, but, that, would, lead, us, to, the, same, considerations, as, those, made, a, moment, ago, the, principle, if, thus, interpreted, could, explain, anything, since, whatever, the, visible, motions, we, could, imagine, hypothetical, motions, to, compensate, them, but, if, it, can, explain, anything, it, will, allow, us, to, foretell, nothing, it, will, not, allow, us, to, choose, between, the, various, possible, hypotheses, since, it, explains, everything, in, advance, it, therefore, becomes, useless, in, the, above, quote, he, refers, to, the, hertz, assumption, of, total, aether, entrainment, that, was, falsified, by, the, fizeau, experiment, but, that, experiment, does, indeed, show, that, that, light, is, partially, carried, along, with, a, substance, finally, in, 1908, he, revisits, the, problem, and, ends, with, abandoning, the, principle, of, reaction, altogether, in, favor, of, supporting, a, solution, based, in, the, inertia, of, aether, itself, but, we, have, seen, above, that, fizeau, s, experiment, does, not, permit, of, our, retaining, the, theory, of, hertz, it, is, necessary, therefore, to, adopt, the, theory, of, lorentz, and, consequently, to, renounce, the, principle, of, reaction, he, also, discussed, two, other, unexplained, effects, 1, non, conservation, of, mass, implied, by, lorentz, s, variable, mass, m, displaystyle, gamma, m, abraham, s, theory, of, variable, mass, and, kaufmann, s, experiments, on, the, mass, of, fast, moving, electrons, and, 2, the, non, conservation, of, energy, in, the, radium, experiments, of, marie, curie, it, was, albert, einstein, s, concept, of, mass, energy, equivalence, 1905, that, a, body, losing, energy, as, radiation, or, heat, was, losing, mass, of, amount, m, e, c, 2, that, resolved, poincar, s, paradox, without, using, any, compensating, mechanism, within, the, ether, the, hertzian, oscillator, loses, mass, in, the, emission, process, and, momentum, is, conserved, in, any, frame, however, concerning, poincar, s, solution, of, the, center, of, gravity, problem, einstein, noted, that, poincar, s, formulation, and, his, own, from, 1906, were, mathematically, equivalent, in, 1905, poincar, first, proposed, gravitational, waves, ondes, gravifiques, emanating, from, a, body, and, propagating, at, the, speed, of, light, he, wrote, it, has, become, important, to, examine, this, hypothesis, more, closely, and, in, particular, to, ask, in, what, ways, it, would, require, us, to, modify, the, laws, of, gravitation, that, is, what, i, have, tried, to, determine, at, first, i, was, led, to, assume, that, the, propagation, of, gravitation, is, not, instantaneous, but, happens, with, the, speed, of, light, einstein, s, first, paper, on, relativity, was, published, three, months, after, poincar, s, short, paper, but, before, poincar, s, longer, version, einstein, relied, on, the, principle, of, relativity, to, derive, the, lorentz, transformations, and, used, a, similar, clock, synchronisation, procedure, einstein, synchronisation, to, the, one, that, poincar, 1900, had, described, but, einstein, s, paper, was, remarkable, in, that, it, contained, no, references, at, all, poincar, never, acknowledged, einstein, s, work, on, special, relativity, however, einstein, expressed, sympathy, with, poincar, s, outlook, obliquely, in, a, letter, to, hans, vaihinger, on, 3, may, 1919, when, einstein, considered, vaihinger, s, general, outlook, to, be, close, to, his, own, and, poincar, s, to, be, close, to, vaihinger, s, in, public, einstein, acknowledged, poincar, posthumously, in, the, text, of, a, lecture, in, 1921, titled, geometrie, und, erfahrung, geometry, and, experience, in, connection, with, non, euclidean, geometry, but, not, in, connection, with, special, relativity, a, few, years, before, his, death, einstein, commented, on, poincar, as, being, one, of, the, pioneers, of, relativity, saying, lorentz, had, already, recognized, that, the, transformation, named, after, him, is, essential, for, the, analysis, of, maxwell, s, equations, and, poincar, deepened, this, insight, still, further, poincar, s, work, in, the, development, of, special, relativity, is, well, recognised, though, most, historians, stress, that, despite, many, similarities, with, einstein, s, work, the, two, had, very, different, research, agendas, and, interpretations, of, the, work, poincar, developed, a, similar, physical, interpretation, of, local, time, and, noticed, the, connection, to, signal, velocity, but, contrary, to, einstein, he, continued, to, use, the, ether, concept, in, his, papers, and, argued, that, clocks, at, rest, in, the, ether, show, the, true, time, and, moving, clocks, show, the, local, time, so, poincar, tried, to, keep, the, relativity, principle, in, accordance, with, classical, concepts, while, einstein, developed, a, mathematically, equivalent, kinematics, based, on, the, new, physical, concepts, of, the, relativity, of, space, and, time, while, this, is, the, view, of, most, historians, a, minority, go, much, further, such, as, e, t, whittaker, who, held, that, poincar, and, lorentz, were, the, true, discoverers, of, relativity, poincar, introduced, group, theory, to, physics, and, was, the, first, to, study, the, group, of, lorentz, transformations, he, also, made, major, contributions, to, the, theory, of, discrete, groups, and, their, representations, the, subject, is, clearly, defined, by, felix, klein, in, his, erlangen, program, 1872, the, geometry, invariants, of, arbitrary, continuous, transformation, a, kind, of, geometry, the, term, topology, was, introduced, as, suggested, by, johann, benedict, listing, instead, of, previously, used, analysis, situs, some, important, concepts, were, introduced, by, enrico, betti, and, bernhard, riemann, but, the, foundation, of, this, science, for, a, space, of, any, dimension, was, created, by, poincar, his, first, article, on, this, topic, appeared, in, 1894, his, research, in, geometry, led, to, the, abstract, topological, definition, of, homotopy, and, homology, he, also, first, introduced, the, basic, concepts, and, invariants, of, combinatorial, topology, such, as, betti, numbers, and, the, fundamental, group, poincar, proved, a, formula, relating, the, number, of, edges, vertices, and, faces, of, n, dimensional, polyhedron, the, euler, poincar, theorem, and, gave, the, first, precise, formulation, of, the, intuitive, notion, of, dimension, poincar, published, two, now, classical, monographs, new, methods, of, celestial, mechanics, 1892, 1899, and, lectures, on, celestial, mechanics, 1905, 1910, in, them, he, successfully, applied, the, results, of, their, research, to, the, problem, of, the, motion, of, three, bodies, and, studied, in, detail, the, behavior, of, solutions, frequency, stability, asymptotic, and, so, on, they, introduced, the, small, parameter, method, fixed, points, integral, invariants, variational, equations, the, convergence, of, the, asymptotic, expansions, generalizing, a, theory, of, bruns, 1887, poincar, showed, that, the, three, body, problem, is, not, integrable, in, other, words, the, general, solution, of, the, three, body, problem, can, not, be, expressed, in, terms, of, algebraic, and, transcendental, functions, through, unambiguous, coordinates, and, velocities, of, the, bodies, his, work, in, this, area, was, the, first, major, achievement, in, celestial, mechanics, since, isaac, newton, these, monographs, include, an, idea, of, poincar, which, later, became, the, basis, for, mathematical, chaos, theory, see, in, particular, the, poincar, recurrence, theorem, and, the, general, theory, of, dynamical, systems, poincar, authored, important, works, on, astronomy, for, the, equilibrium, figures, of, a, gravitating, rotating, fluid, he, introduced, the, important, concept, of, bifurcation, points, and, proved, the, existence, of, equilibrium, figures, such, as, the, non, ellipsoids, including, ring, shaped, and, pear, shaped, figures, and, their, stability, for, this, discovery, poincar, received, the, gold, medal, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, 1900, after, defending, his, doctoral, thesis, on, the, study, of, singular, points, of, the, system, of, differential, equations, poincar, wrote, a, series, of, memoirs, under, the, title, on, curves, defined, by, differential, equations, 1881, 1882, in, these, articles, he, built, a, new, branch, of, mathematics, called, qualitative, theory, of, differential, equations, poincar, showed, that, even, if, the, differential, equation, can, not, be, solved, in, terms, of, known, functions, yet, from, the, very, form, of, the, equation, a, wealth, of, information, about, the, properties, and, behavior, of, the, solutions, can, be, found, in, particular, poincar, investigated, the, nature, of, the, trajectories, of, the, integral, curves, in, the, plane, gave, a, classification, of, singular, points, saddle, focus, center, node, introduced, the, concept, of, a, limit, cycle, and, the, loop, index, and, showed, that, the, number, of, limit, cycles, is, always, finite, except, for, some, special, cases, poincar, also, developed, a, general, theory, of, integral, invariants, and, solutions, of, the, variational, equations, for, the, finite, difference, equations, he, created, a, new, direction, the, asymptotic, analysis, of, the, solutions, he, applied, all, these, achievements, to, study, practical, problems, of, mathematical, physics, and, celestial, mechanics, and, the, methods, used, were, the, basis, of, its, topological, works, poincar, s, work, habits, have, been, compared, to, a, bee, flying, from, flower, to, flower, poincar, was, interested, in, the, way, his, mind, worked, he, studied, his, habits, and, gave, a, talk, about, his, observations, in, 1908, at, the, institute, of, general, psychology, in, paris, he, linked, his, way, of, thinking, to, how, he, made, several, discoveries, the, mathematician, darboux, claimed, he, was, un, intuitif, an, intuitive, arguing, that, this, is, demonstrated, by, the, fact, that, he, worked, so, often, by, visual, representation, jacques, hadamard, wrote, that, poincar, s, research, demonstrated, marvelous, clarity, and, poincar, himself, wrote, that, he, believed, that, logic, was, not, a, way, to, invent, but, a, way, to, structure, ideas, and, that, logic, limits, ideas, poincar, s, mental, organisation, was, interesting, not, only, to, poincar, himself, but, also, to, douard, toulouse, a, psychologist, of, the, psychology, laboratory, of, the, school, of, higher, studies, in, paris, toulouse, wrote, a, book, entitled, henri, poincar, 1910, in, it, he, discussed, poincar, s, regular, schedule, these, abilities, were, offset, to, some, extent, by, his, shortcomings, in, addition, toulouse, stated, that, most, mathematicians, worked, from, principles, already, established, while, poincar, started, from, basic, principles, each, time, o, connor, et, al, 2002, his, method, of, thinking, is, well, summarised, as, habitu, n, gliger, les, d, tails, et, ne, regarder, que, les, cimes, il, passait, de, l, une, l, autre, avec, une, promptitude, surprenante, et, les, faits, qu, il, d, couvrait, se, groupant, d, eux, m, mes, autour, de, leur, centre, taient, instantan, ment, et, automatiquement, class, s, dans, sa, m, moire, accustomed, to, neglecting, details, and, to, looking, only, at, mountain, tops, he, went, from, one, peak, to, another, with, surprising, rapidity, and, the, facts, he, discovered, clustering, around, their, center, were, instantly, and, automatically, pigeonholed, in, his, memory, awards, named, after, him, henri, poincar, did, not, receive, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, but, he, had, influential, advocates, like, henri, becquerel, or, committee, member, g, sta, mittag, leffler, the, nomination, archive, reveals, that, poincar, received, a, total, of, 51, nominations, between, 1904, and, 1912, the, year, of, his, death, of, the, 58, nominations, for, the, 1910, nobel, prize, 34, named, poincar, nominators, included, nobel, laureates, hendrik, lorentz, and, pieter, zeeman, both, of, 1902, marie, curie, of, 1903, albert, michelson, of, 1907, gabriel, lippmann, of, 1908, and, guglielmo, marconi, of, 1909, the, fact, that, renowned, theoretical, physicists, like, poincar, boltzmann, or, gibbs, were, not, awarded, the, nobel, prize, is, seen, as, evidence, that, the, nobel, committee, had, more, regard, for, experimentation, than, theory, in, poincar, s, case, several, of, those, who, nominated, him, pointed, out, that, the, greatest, problem, was, to, name, a, specific, discovery, invention, or, technique, poincar, had, philosophical, views, opposite, to, those, of, bertrand, russell, and, gottlob, frege, who, believed, that, mathematics, was, a, branch, of, logic, poincar, strongly, disagreed, claiming, that, intuition, was, the, life, of, mathematics, poincar, gives, an, interesting, point, of, view, in, his, 1902, book, science, and, hypothesis, for, a, superficial, observer, scientific, truth, is, beyond, the, possibility, of, doubt, the, logic, of, science, is, infallible, and, if, the, scientists, are, sometimes, mistaken, this, is, only, from, their, mistaking, its, rule, poincar, believed, that, arithmetic, is, synthetic, he, argued, that, peano, s, axioms, cannot, be, proven, non, circularly, with, the, principle, of, induction, murzi, 1998, therefore, concluding, that, arithmetic, is, a, priori, synthetic, and, not, analytic, poincar, then, went, on, to, say, that, mathematics, cannot, be, deduced, from, logic, since, it, is, not, analytic, his, views, were, similar, to, those, of, immanuel, kant, kolak, 2001, folina, 1992, he, strongly, opposed, cantorian, set, theory, objecting, to, its, use, of, impredicative, definitions, however, poincar, did, not, share, kantian, views, in, all, branches, of, philosophy, and, mathematics, for, example, in, geometry, poincar, believed, that, the, structure, of, non, euclidean, space, can, be, known, analytically, poincar, held, that, convention, plays, an, important, role, in, physics, his, view, and, some, later, more, extreme, versions, of, it, came, to, be, known, as, conventionalism, poincar, believed, that, newton, s, first, law, was, not, empirical, but, is, a, conventional, framework, assumption, for, mechanics, gargani, 2012, he, also, believed, that, the, geometry, of, physical, space, is, conventional, he, considered, examples, in, which, either, the, geometry, of, the, physical, fields, or, gradients, of, temperature, can, be, changed, either, describing, a, space, as, non, euclidean, measured, by, rigid, rulers, or, as, a, euclidean, space, where, the, rulers, are, expanded, or, shrunk, by, a, variable, heat, distribution, however, poincar, thought, that, we, were, so, accustomed, to, euclidean, geometry, that, we, would, prefer, to, change, the, physical, laws, to, save, euclidean, geometry, rather, than, shift, to, non, euclidean, physical, geometry, poincar, s, famous, lectures, before, the, soci, t, de, psychologie, in, paris, published, as, science, and, hypothesis, the, value, of, science, and, science, and, method, were, cited, by, jacques, hadamard, as, the, source, for, the, idea, that, creativity, and, invention, consist, of, two, mental, stages, first, random, combinations, of, possible, solutions, to, a, problem, followed, by, a, critical, evaluation, although, he, most, often, spoke, of, a, deterministic, universe, poincar, said, that, the, subconscious, generation, of, new, possibilities, involves, chance, it, is, certain, that, the, combinations, which, present, themselves, to, the, mind, in, a, kind, of, sudden, illumination, after, a, somewhat, prolonged, period, of, unconscious, work, are, generally, useful, and, fruitful, combinations, all, the, combinations, are, formed, as, a, result, of, the, automatic, action, of, the, subliminal, ego, but, those, only, which, are, interesting, find, their, way, into, the, field, of, consciousness, a, few, only, are, harmonious, and, consequently, at, once, useful, and, beautiful, and, they, will, be, capable, of, affecting, the, geometrician, s, special, sensibility, i, have, been, speaking, of, which, once, aroused, will, direct, our, attention, upon, them, and, will, thus, give, them, the, opportunity, of, becoming, conscious, in, the, subliminal, ego, on, the, contrary, there, reigns, what, i, would, call, liberty, if, one, could, give, this, name, to, the, mere, absence, of, discipline, and, to, disorder, born, of, chance, poincar, s, two, stages, random, combinations, followed, by, selection, became, the, basis, for, daniel, dennett, s, two, stage, model, of, free, will, popular, writings, on, the, philosophy, of, science, on, algebraic, topology, on, celestial, mechanics, on, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, other, exhaustive, bibliography, of, english, translations, here, is, a, list, of, theorems, proved, by, poincar
