their, russian, language, newspaper, but, his, revolutionary, fervor, exceeded, their, moderate, reform, agenda, bakunin, s, 1862, pamphlet, the, people, s, cause, romanov, pugachev, or, pestel, criticized, the, russian, tsar, for, not, using, his, position, to, facilitate, a, bloodless, revolution, and, forgo, another, pugachev, s, rebellion, in, early, august, 1862, he, briefly, travelled, to, paris, in, paris, at, this, time, famous, photographer, nadar, took, three, famous, photographs, of, him, on, august, 7, 1862, after, being, photographed, he, also, signed, nadar, s, livre, d, or,

the, polish, january, uprising, against, russia, bakunin, reunited, with, his, wife, moved, to, italy, the, next, year, where, they, stayed, for, three, years, bakunin, in, his, early, 50s, developed, his, core, anarchist, thoughts, in, italy, he, continued, to, refine, these, ideas, in, his, remaining, 12, years, among, this, ideology, was, the, first, of, many, conspiratorial, revolutionary, societies, though, none, of, these, participated, in, revolutionary, actions, chiefly, the, revolutionary, toppling, of, the, state, to, be, replaced, by, free, federation, between, voluntarily, associated, economic, producers, he, moved, to, switzerland, in, 1867, a, more, permissive, environment, for, revolutionary, literature, bakunin, s, anarchist, writings, were, fragmentary, and, prolific, with, france, s, collapse, in, the, 1870, franco, prussian, war, bakunin, traveled, to, lyon, and, participated, in, the, fruitless, lyon, commune, in, which, the, citizens, briefly, occupied, the, city, hall, bakunin, retreated, to, switzerland, in, switzerland, the, russian, revolutionary, sergey, nechayev, sought, out, bakunin, for, a, collaboration, not, knowing, nechayev, s, past, betrayals, bakunin, warmed, to, nechayev, s, revolutionary, zeal, and, they, together, produced, the, 1869, catechism, of, the, revolutionary, a, tract, that, endorsed, an, ascetic, life, for, revolutionaries, without, societal, or, moral, bonds, bakunin, s, connection, with, nechayev, hurt, the, former, s, reputation, more, recent, scholarship, however, challenges, the, catechism, s, authorship, crediting, nechayev, as, the, primary, or, sole, author, bakunin, ultimately, disavowed, their, connection, while, bakunin, encountered, karl, marx, in, paris, 1844, and, london, 1864, he, came, to, know, him, through, the, first, international, international, working, men, s, association, which, marx, and, friedrich, engels, formed, in, the, 1860s, bakunin, s, relationship, with, marx, became, strained, in, the, early, 1870s, for, both, interpersonal, and, ideological, differences, bakunin, respected, marx, s, erudition, and, passion, for, socialism, but, found, his, personality, to, be, authoritarian, and, arrogant, in, turn, marx, was, skeptical, towards, russian, reactionism, and, bakunin, s, unruliness, as, bakunin, developed, his, anarchist, ideas, in, this, period, he, came, to, see, federative, social, organization, led, by, the, peasantry, and, poorest, workers, as, the, primary, post, revolution, goal, whereas, marx, believed, in, a, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, led, by, organized, workers, in, industrially, advanced, countries, in, which, the, workers, use, state, infrastructure, until, the, state, withers, away, bakunists, abhorred, the, political, organization, for, which, marx, advocated, marx, had, bakunin, and, bakunist, anarchists, ejected, from, the, first, international, s, 1872, hague, congress, this, breaking, point, split, the, marxist, socialist, movement, from, the, anarchist, movement, and, led, to, the, undoing, of, the, international, bakunin, s, ideas, continued, to, spread, nevertheless, to, the, labor, movement, in, spain, and, the, watchmakers, of, the, swiss, jura, federation, bakunin, wrote, his, last, major, work, statism, and, anarchy, 1873, anonymously, in, russian, to, stir, underground, revolution, in, russia, it, restates, his, anarchist, position, establishes, the, german, empire, as, the, foremost, centralized, state, in, opposition, to, european, anarchism, likens, marx, to, german, authoritarianism, and, warns, of, marx, s, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, being, led, by, autocrats, for, their, own, gain, in, the, name, of, the, proletariat, this, premonition, furthered, the, gulf, between, the, marxists, and, bakunist, anarchists, in, one, final, revolutionary, act, bakunin, planned, the, unsuccessful, 1874, bologna, insurrection, with, his, italian, followers, its, failure, was, a, major, setback, to, the, italian, anarchist, movement, bakunin, retreated, to, switzerland, where, he, retired, dying, in, bern, on, 1, july, 1876, the, passion, for, destruction, is, also, a, creative, passion, much, of, bakunin, s, writings, on, anarchism, reflects, antipathy, for, the, state, and, political, organization, itself, as, the, source, of, oppression, and, exploitation, his, revolutionary, solutions, focus, on, undoing, the, state, and, hierarchical, religious, social, and, economic, institutions, to, be, replaced, by, a, system, of, freely, federated, communes, organized, from, below, upward, with, voluntary, associations, of, economic, producers, starting, locally, but, ostensibly, organizing, internationally, these, thoughts, were, first, published, in, his, unfinished, 1871, the, knouto, germanic, empire, and, the, social, revolution, expanded, by, a, second, part, published, in, his, 1908, oeuvres, and, again, elaborated, a, fragment, found, and, published, posthumously, as, god, and, the, state, 1882, the, latter, was, his, most, famous, work, translated, widely, and, a, touchstone, of, anarchist, literature, it, appeals, to, cast, off, both, the, state, and, religion, to, realize, man, s, inborn, freedom, bakunin, s, core, political, thought, addressed, emancipatory, communities, in, which, members, freely, develop, their, abilities, and, faculties, without, overpowering, each, other, participation, within, community, was, a, personal, concern, of, his, and, his, vision, of, a, community, s, role, in, creating, free, and, happy, humans, stemmed, from, his, close, sibling, relationships, bakunin, unsuccessfully, sought, community, in, religion, and, philosophy, through, influences, including, arnold, ruge, left, hegelianism, ludwig, feuerbach, philosophical, humanism, wilhelm, weitling, proto, communism, and, pierre, joseph, proudhon, early, anarchism, bakunin, turned, from, metaphysics, and, theory, to, the, practice, of, creating, communities, of, free, independent, people, his, first, attempts, at, this, with, the, polish, emigrants, and, prague, slav, congress, in, the, 1840s, focused, on, national, liberation, but, he, turned, to, emancipatory, community, after, the, failed, 1863, polish, naval, expedition, for, bakunin, freedom, required, community, such, that, humanity, could, only, be, free, if, everyone, was, free, and, equality, that, all, people, have, the, same, starting, basis, including, equality, in, rights, and, social, functions, for, women, he, envisioned, an, international, revolution, by, the, awakened, masses, that, would, bring, about, new, forms, of, social, organization, by, committees, of, delegates, and, independent, municipalities, in, a, large, scale, federation, undoing, all, state, structure, and, social, coercion, in, this, emancipated, community, every, adult, would, be, entitled, freedom, to, be, governed, by, their, own, conscience, and, reason, according, to, their, own, will, responsible, foremost, to, themselves, and, then, to, their, community, he, did, not, believe, a, reformed, bourgeois, or, revolutionary, state, could, emancipate, like, such, a, community, he, described, so, his, vision, of, revolution, meant, not, capturing, power, but, ensuring, that, no, new, power, took, the, place, of, the, old, bakunin, was, not, a, systematic, thinker, and, did, not, design, grand, systems, or, theoretical, constructs, his, writing, was, prolific, and, fragmented, he, was, prone, to, large, digressions, and, rarely, completed, what, he, set, out, to, address, as, a, result, much, of, his, writings, on, anarchism, do, not, cohere, and, were, published, only, posthumously, bakunin, did, develop, his, theoretical, perspective, through, draft, programs, bakunin, first, called, himself, an, anarchist, in, 1867, bakunin, saw, the, institutions, of, church, and, state, as, standing, against, the, aims, of, emancipatory, community, namely, that, they, impose, wisdom, and, justice, from, above, under, the, pretense, that, the, masses, could, not, fully, self, govern, he, wrote, that, to, exploit, and, to, govern, mean, the, same, thing, bakunin, held, the, state, as, a, regulated, system, of, domination, and, exploitation, by, a, privileged, ruling, class, this, applied, to, states, both, historical, and, contemporaneous, including, modern, monarchies, and, republics, that, each, used, military, and, bureaucratic, centralization, he, regarded, representative, democracies, as, a, paradoxical, abstraction, from, social, reality, although, a, popular, legislature, is, meant, to, represent, the, will, of, the, people, he, saw, it, rarely, function, as, such, in, practice, elected, politicians, instead, represented, abstractions, bakunin, believed, that, powerful, institutions, to, be, inherently, stronger, than, individual, will, and, incapable, of, internal, reform, due, to, the, overwhelming, ambitions, and, temptations, that, corrupt, those, with, power, to, bakunin, anarchists, were, rightly, enemies, of, all, power, knowing, that, power, corrupts, those, invested, with, it, just, as, much, as, those, compelled, to, submit, to, it, bakunin, clashed, with, marx, over, worker, governance, and, revolutionary, change, bakunin, argued, that, even, the, best, revolutionary, placed, on, the, russian, throne, would, become, worse, than, czar, alexander, bakunin, wrote, that, socialist, workers, in, power, would, become, ex, workers, who, govern, by, their, own, pretensions, not, representing, the, people, bakunin, did, not, believe, in, transitional, dictatorship, serving, any, purpose, other, than, to, perpetuate, itself, saying, that, liberty, without, socialism, is, privilege, and, injustice, and, socialism, without, liberty, is, slavery, and, brutality, bakunin, disagreed, with, marx, that, the, state, would, wither, away, under, worker, ownership, and, that, worker, conquest, and, changes, in, production, conditions, would, inherently, kill, the, state, bakunin, promoted, spontaneous, worker, actions, over, marx, s, suggested, organization, of, a, working, class, party, while, bakunin, believed, that, science, and, specialists, could, be, useful, in, enlightening, communities, he, did, not, believe, in, government, by, experts, or, letting, any, privileged, minority, rule, over, a, majority, or, any, presumed, intelligence, rule, over, a, presumed, stupidity, bakunin, wrote, of, referring, to, the, authority, to, the, bootmaker, on, boots, and, to, savants, for, their, specialities, and, listening, to, the, freely, in, respect, for, their, expertise, but, not, allowing, the, bootmaker, or, the, savant, to, impose, this, authority, and, not, letting, them, be, beyond, reproach, of, criticism, or, censure, bakunin, believed, that, authority, should, be, in, continual, voluntary, exchange, rather, than, a, constant, subordination, he, believed, intelligence, to, have, intrinsic, benefits, so, as, to, not, require, additional, privileges, towards, the, end, of, his, life, beginning, in, 1864, in, italy, with, the, international, brotherhood, bakunin, attempted, to, unite, his, international, network, under, secret, revolutionary, societies, a, concept, at, odds, with, his, professed, caution, against, the, autocratic, tendencies, of, the, revolutionary, elite, composed, of, bakunin, s, circle, these, informal, groups, existed, mainly, on, paper, and, thus, did, not, participate, in, revolutionary, action, or, bridge, revolutionary, theory, to, practice, like, bakunin, intended, the, groups, operated, with, significant, autonomy, having, diverged, from, bakunin, on, multiple, controversial, issues, despite, being, cast, at, the, hague, congress, as, under, bakunin, s, stern, authority, they, were, organized, by, personal, relationships, rather, than, the, vertical, hierarchies, and, membership, ranks, found, in, bakunin, s, notes, his, written, programs, played, a, larger, role, in, his, politics, than, these, draft, secret, societies, the, idea, of, the, invisible, dictatorship, was, central, to, bakunin, s, politics, in, combination, with, bakunin, s, opposition, to, parliamentary, politics, historian, peter, marshall, wrote, that, such, a, secret, party, its, existence, unknown, and, its, policies, beholden, to, none, had, the, potential, for, greater, tyranny, than, a, blanquist, or, marxist, party, and, was, hard, to, envision, as, presaging, an, open, democratic, society, bakunin, married, antonia, kwiatkowska, originally, from, poland, during, his, exile, in, siberia, kwiatkowska, was, much, younger, than, bakunin, a, difference, of, 26, years, she, was, 18, and, had, little, interest, in, politics, their, differences, and, bakunin, s, meagre, attention, to, romance, have, left, biographers, speculating, about, possible, psychosexual, rationales, for, bakunin, s, personal, life, and, the, extent, of, his, dedication, to, revolutionary, action, though, she, remained, married, to, bakunin, until, his, death, in, 1876, kwiatkowska, had, three, children, with, another, man, while, bakunin, was, still, alive, an, italian, disciple, of, his, who, married, her, after, bakunin, s, death, bakunin, was, the, leading, anarchist, revolutionary, of, the, 19th, century, active, from, the, 1840s, through, the, 1870s, his, foundational, anarchist, writings, helped, the, movement, stand, in, contrast, to, capitalism, and, marxism, and, became, more, popular, after, his, death, with, some, of, his, highest, regarded, works, published, posthumously, and, in, new, editions, his, statism, and, anarchy, influenced, the, growing, russian, narodnik, movement, of, peasant, socialism, and, his, anarchism, influenced, ideology, in, both, the, russian, revolution, and, the, spanish, civil, war, the, 1960s, new, left, revived, interest, in, his, works, and, ideas, of, voluntary, association, and, opposition, to, authoritarian, socialism, with, new, editions, and, translations, published, bakunin, s, legacy, reflects, the, paradox, and, ambivalence, by, which, he, lived, as, historian, paul, avrich, put, it, bakunin, was, a, nobleman, who, yearned, for, a, peasant, revolt, a, libertarian, with, an, urge, to, dominate, others, an, intellectual, with, a, powerful, anti, intellectual, streak, who, professed, support, for, unfettered, liberty, while, demanding, unconditional, obedience, from, his, followers, many, of, his, actions, put, him, closer, to, later, authoritarian, movements, even, if, his, words, were, anti, authoritarian, in, particular, the, antisemitic, passages, in, bakunin, s, writing, have, been, the, subject, of, extended, interest, such, that, bakunin, biographer, mark, leier, has, said, the, question, is, raised, every, time, he, speaks, on, bakunin, both, leier, and, scholar, of, antisemitism, eirik, eiglad, have, commented, that, antisemitism, was, not, essential, to, bakunin, s, thought, nor, was, his, thought, valued, for, his, antisemitism, sociologist, marcel, stoetzler, argued, the, opposite, saying, that, the, antisemitic, trope, of, jewish, world, domination, was, at, the, centre, of, bakunin, s, political, thought, bakunin, s, anti, jewish, and, anti, german,
