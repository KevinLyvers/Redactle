the, st, lawrence, river, during, the, siege, of, quebec, which, brought, him, to, the, attention, of, the, admiralty, and, the, royal, society, this, acclaim, came, at, a, crucial, moment, for, the, direction, of, british, overseas, exploration, and, it, led, to, his, commission, in, 1768, as, commander, of, hms, endeavour, for, the, first, of, three, pacific, voyages, in, these, voyages, cook, sailed, thousands, of, miles, across, largely, uncharted, areas, of, the, globe, he, mapped, lands, from, new, zealand, to, hawaii, in, the, pacific, ocean, in, greater, detail, and, on, a, scale,

adverse, conditions, and, brought, him, to, the, attention, of, the, admiralty, and, royal, society, at, a, crucial, moment, both, in, his, career, and, in, the, direction, of, british, overseas, discovery, cook, s, maps, were, used, into, the, 20th, century, with, copies, being, referenced, by, those, sailing, newfoundland, s, waters, for, 200, years, following, his, exertions, in, newfoundland, cook, wrote, that, he, intended, to, go, not, only, farther, than, any, man, has, been, before, me, but, as, far, as, i, think, it, is, possible, for, a, man, to, go, on, 25, may, 1768, the, admiralty, commissioned, cook, to, command, a, scientific, voyage, to, the, pacific, ocean, the, purpose, of, the, voyage, was, to, observe, and, record, the, 1769, transit, of, venus, across, the, sun, which, when, combined, with, observations, from, other, places, would, help, to, determine, the, distance, of, the, earth, from, the, sun, cook, at, age, 39, was, promoted, to, lieutenant, to, grant, him, sufficient, status, to, take, the, command, for, its, part, the, royal, society, agreed, that, cook, would, receive, a, one, hundred, guinea, gratuity, in, addition, to, his, naval, pay, the, expedition, sailed, aboard, hms, endeavour, departing, england, on, 26, august, 1768, cook, and, his, crew, rounded, cape, horn, and, continued, westward, across, the, pacific, arriving, at, tahiti, on, 13, april, 1769, where, the, observations, of, the, transit, were, made, however, the, result, of, the, observations, was, not, as, conclusive, or, accurate, as, had, been, hoped, once, the, observations, were, completed, cook, opened, the, sealed, orders, which, were, additional, instructions, from, the, admiralty, for, the, second, part, of, his, voyage, to, search, the, south, pacific, for, signs, of, the, postulated, rich, southern, continent, of, terra, australis, cook, then, sailed, to, new, zealand, where, he, mapped, the, complete, coastline, making, only, some, minor, errors, with, the, aid, of, tupaia, a, tahitian, priest, who, had, joined, the, expedition, cook, was, the, first, european, to, communicate, with, the, m, ori, however, at, least, eight, m, ori, were, killed, in, violent, encounters, cook, then, voyaged, west, reaching, the, southeastern, coast, of, australia, near, today, s, point, hicks, on, 19, april, 1770, and, in, doing, so, his, expedition, became, the, first, recorded, europeans, to, have, encountered, its, eastern, coastline, on, 23, april, he, made, his, first, recorded, direct, observation, of, aboriginal, australians, at, brush, island, near, bawley, point, noting, in, his, journal, and, were, so, near, the, shore, as, to, distinguish, several, people, upon, the, sea, beach, they, appear, d, to, be, of, a, very, dark, or, black, colour, but, whether, this, was, the, real, colour, of, their, skins, or, the, c, othes, they, might, have, on, i, know, not, endeavour, continued, northwards, along, the, coastline, keeping, the, land, in, sight, with, cook, charting, and, naming, landmarks, as, he, went, on, 29, april, cook, and, crew, made, their, first, landfall, on, the, continent, at, a, beach, now, known, as, silver, beach, on, botany, bay, kamay, botany, bay, national, park, two, gweagal, men, of, the, dharawal, eora, nation, opposed, their, landing, and, in, the, confrontation, one, of, them, was, shot, and, wounded, cook, and, his, crew, stayed, at, botany, bay, for, a, week, collecting, water, timber, fodder, and, botanical, specimens, and, exploring, the, surrounding, area, cook, sought, to, establish, relations, with, the, indigenous, population, without, success, at, first, cook, named, the, inlet, sting, ray, harbour, after, the, many, stingrays, found, there, this, was, later, changed, to, botanist, bay, and, finally, botany, bay, after, the, unique, specimens, retrieved, by, the, botanists, joseph, banks, and, daniel, solander, this, first, landing, site, was, later, to, be, promoted, particularly, by, joseph, banks, as, a, suitable, candidate, for, situating, a, settlement, and, british, colonial, outpost, after, his, departure, from, botany, bay, he, continued, northwards, he, stopped, at, bustard, bay, now, known, as, seventeen, seventy, on, 23, may, 1770, on, 24, may, cook, and, banks, and, others, went, ashore, continuing, north, on, 11, june, a, mishap, occurred, when, endeavour, ran, aground, on, a, shoal, of, the, great, barrier, reef, and, then, nursed, into, a, river, mouth, on, 18, june, 1770, the, ship, was, badly, damaged, and, his, voyage, was, delayed, almost, seven, weeks, while, repairs, were, carried, out, on, the, beach, near, the, docks, of, modern, cooktown, queensland, at, the, mouth, of, the, endeavour, river, the, crew, s, encounters, with, the, local, aboriginal, people, were, mostly, peaceful, although, following, a, dispute, over, green, turtles, cook, ordered, shots, to, be, fired, and, one, local, was, lightly, wounded, the, voyage, then, continued, and, at, about, midday, on, 22, august, 1770, they, reached, the, northernmost, tip, of, the, coast, and, without, leaving, the, ship, cook, named, it, york, cape, now, cape, york, leaving, the, east, coast, cook, turned, west, and, nursed, his, battered, ship, through, the, dangerously, shallow, waters, of, torres, strait, searching, for, a, vantage, point, cook, saw, a, steep, hill, on, a, nearby, island, from, the, top, of, which, he, hoped, to, see, a, passage, into, the, indian, seas, cook, named, the, island, possession, island, where, he, claimed, the, entire, coastline, that, he, had, just, explored, as, british, territory, cook, returned, to, england, via, batavia, modern, jakarta, indonesia, where, many, in, his, crew, succumbed, to, malaria, and, then, the, cape, of, good, hope, arriving, at, the, island, of, saint, helena, on, 30, april, 1771, the, ship, finally, returned, to, england, on, 12, july, 1771, anchoring, in, the, downs, with, cook, going, to, deal, cook, s, journals, were, published, upon, his, return, and, he, became, something, of, a, hero, among, the, scientific, community, among, the, general, public, however, the, aristocratic, botanist, joseph, banks, was, a, greater, hero, banks, even, attempted, to, take, command, of, cook, s, second, voyage, but, removed, himself, from, the, voyage, before, it, began, and, johann, reinhold, forster, and, his, son, georg, forster, were, taken, on, as, scientists, for, the, voyage, cook, s, son, george, was, born, five, days, before, he, left, for, his, second, voyage, shortly, after, his, return, from, the, first, voyage, cook, was, promoted, in, august, 1771, to, the, rank, of, commander, in, 1772, he, was, commissioned, to, lead, another, scientific, expedition, on, behalf, of, the, royal, society, to, search, for, the, hypothetical, terra, australis, on, his, first, voyage, cook, had, demonstrated, by, circumnavigating, new, zealand, that, it, was, not, attached, to, a, larger, landmass, to, the, south, although, he, charted, almost, the, entire, eastern, coastline, of, australia, showing, it, to, be, continental, in, size, the, terra, australis, was, believed, to, lie, further, south, despite, this, evidence, to, the, contrary, alexander, dalrymple, and, others, of, the, royal, society, still, believed, that, a, massive, southern, continent, should, exist, cook, commanded, hms, resolution, on, this, voyage, while, tobias, furneaux, commanded, its, companion, ship, hms, adventure, cook, s, expedition, circumnavigated, the, globe, at, an, extreme, southern, latitude, becoming, one, of, the, first, to, cross, the, antarctic, circle, on, 17, january, 1773, in, the, antarctic, fog, resolution, and, adventure, became, separated, furneaux, made, his, way, to, new, zealand, where, he, lost, some, of, his, men, during, an, encounter, with, m, ori, and, eventually, sailed, back, to, britain, while, cook, continued, to, explore, the, antarctic, reaching, 71, 10, s, on, 31, january, 1774, cook, almost, encountered, the, mainland, of, antarctica, but, turned, towards, tahiti, to, resupply, his, ship, he, then, resumed, his, southward, course, in, a, second, fruitless, attempt, to, find, the, supposed, continent, on, this, leg, of, the, voyage, he, brought, a, young, tahitian, named, omai, who, proved, to, be, somewhat, less, knowledgeable, about, the, pacific, than, tupaia, had, been, on, the, first, voyage, on, his, return, voyage, to, new, zealand, in, 1774, cook, landed, at, the, friendly, islands, easter, island, norfolk, island, new, caledonia, and, vanuatu, before, returning, to, england, cook, made, a, final, sweep, across, the, south, atlantic, from, cape, horn, and, surveyed, mapped, and, took, possession, for, britain, of, south, georgia, which, had, been, explored, by, the, english, merchant, anthony, de, la, roch, in, 1675, cook, also, discovered, and, named, clerke, rocks, and, the, south, sandwich, islands, sandwich, land, he, then, turned, north, to, south, africa, and, from, there, continued, back, to, england, his, reports, upon, his, return, home, put, to, rest, the, popular, myth, of, terra, australis, cook, s, second, voyage, marked, a, successful, employment, of, larcum, kendall, s, k1, copy, of, john, harrison, s, h4, marine, chronometer, which, enabled, cook, to, calculate, his, longitudinal, position, with, much, greater, accuracy, cook, s, log, was, full, of, praise, for, this, time, piece, which, he, used, to, make, charts, of, the, southern, pacific, ocean, that, were, so, remarkably, accurate, that, copies, of, them, were, still, in, use, in, the, mid, 20th, century, upon, his, return, cook, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, post, captain, and, given, an, honorary, retirement, from, the, royal, navy, with, a, posting, as, an, officer, of, the, greenwich, hospital, he, reluctantly, accepted, insisting, that, he, be, allowed, to, quit, the, post, if, an, opportunity, for, active, duty, should, arise, his, fame, extended, beyond, the, admiralty, he, was, made, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, and, awarded, the, copley, gold, medal, for, completing, his, second, voyage, without, losing, a, man, to, scurvy, nathaniel, dance, holland, painted, his, portrait, he, dined, with, james, boswell, he, was, described, in, the, house, of, lords, as, the, first, navigator, in, europe, but, he, could, not, be, kept, away, from, the, sea, a, third, voyage, was, planned, and, cook, volunteered, to, find, the, northwest, passage, he, travelled, to, the, pacific, and, hoped, to, travel, east, to, the, atlantic, while, a, simultaneous, voyage, travelled, the, opposite, route, on, his, last, voyage, cook, again, commanded, hms, resolution, while, captain, charles, clerke, commanded, hms, discovery, the, voyage, was, ostensibly, planned, to, return, the, pacific, islander, omai, to, tahiti, or, so, the, public, was, led, to, believe, the, trip, s, principal, goal, was, to, locate, a, northwest, passage, around, the, american, continent, after, dropping, omai, at, tahiti, cook, travelled, north, and, in, 1778, became, the, first, european, to, begin, formal, contact, with, the, hawaiian, islands, after, his, initial, landfall, in, january, 1778, at, waimea, harbour, kauai, cook, named, the, archipelago, the, sandwich, islands, after, the, fourth, earl, of, sandwich, the, acting, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, from, the, sandwich, islands, cook, sailed, north, and, then, northeast, to, explore, the, west, coast, of, north, america, north, of, the, spanish, settlements, in, alta, california, he, sighted, the, oregon, coast, at, approximately, 44, 30, north, latitude, naming, cape, foulweather, after, the, bad, weather, which, forced, his, ships, south, to, about, 43, north, before, they, could, begin, their, exploration, of, the, coast, northward, he, unknowingly, sailed, past, the, strait, of, juan, de, fuca, and, soon, after, entered, nootka, sound, on, vancouver, island, he, anchored, near, the, first, nations, village, of, yuquot, cook, s, two, ships, remained, in, nootka, sound, from, 29, march, to, 26, april, 1778, in, what, cook, called, ship, cove, now, resolution, cove, at, the, south, end, of, bligh, island, relations, between, cook, s, crew, and, the, people, of, yuquot, were, cordial, but, sometimes, strained, in, trading, the, people, of, yuquot, demanded, much, more, valuable, items, than, the, usual, trinkets, that, had, been, acceptable, in, hawaii, metal, objects, were, much, desired, but, the, lead, pewter, and, tin, traded, at, first, soon, fell, into, disrepute, the, most, valuable, items, which, the, british, received, in, trade, were, sea, otter, pelts, during, the, stay, the, yuquot, hosts, essentially, controlled, the, trade, with, the, british, vessels, the, natives, usually, visited, the, british, vessels, at, resolution, cove, instead, of, the, british, visiting, the, village, of, yuquot, at, friendly, cove, after, leaving, nootka, sound, in, search, of, the, northwest, passage, cook, explored, and, mapped, the, coast, all, the, way, to, the, bering, strait, on, the, way, identifying, what, came, to, be, known, as, cook, inlet, in, alaska, in, a, single, visit, cook, charted, the, majority, of, the, north, american, northwest, coastline, on, world, maps, for, the, first, time, determined, the, extent, of, alaska, and, closed, the, gaps, in, russian, from, the, west, and, spanish, from, the, south, exploratory, probes, of, the, northern, limits, of, the, pacific, by, the, second, week, of, august, 1778, cook, was, through, the, bering, strait, sailing, into, the, chukchi, sea, he, headed, northeast, up, the, coast, of, alaska, until, he, was, blocked, by, sea, ice, at, a, latitude, of, 70, 44, north, cook, then, sailed, west, to, the, siberian, coast, and, then, southeast, down, the, siberian, coast, back, to, the, bering, strait, by, early, september, 1778, he, was, back, in, the, bering, sea, to, begin, the, trip, to, the, sandwich, hawaiian, islands, he, became, increasingly, frustrated, on, this, voyage, and, perhaps, began, to, suffer, from, a, stomach, ailment, it, has, been, speculated, that, this, led, to, irrational, behaviour, towards, his, crew, such, as, forcing, them, to, eat, walrus, meat, which, they, had, pronounced, inedible, cook, returned, to, hawaii, in, 1779, after, sailing, around, the, archipelago, for, some, eight, weeks, he, made, landfall, at, kealakekua, bay, on, hawai, i, island, the, largest, island, in, the, hawaiian, archipelago, cook, s, arrival, coincided, with, the, makahiki, a, hawaiian, harvest, festival, of, worship, for, the, polynesian, god, lono, coincidentally, the, form, of, cook, s, ship, hms, resolution, or, more, particularly, the, mast, formation, sails, and, rigging, resembled, certain, significant, artefacts, that, formed, part, of, the, season, of,

island, during, the, lono, festivals, it, has, been, argued, most, extensively, by, marshall, sahlins, that, such, coincidences, were, the, reasons, for, cook, s, and, to, a, limited, extent, his, crew, s, initial, deification, by, some, hawaiians, who, treated, cook, as, an, incarnation, of, lono, though, this, view, was, first, suggested, by, members, of, cook, s, expedition, the, idea, that, any, hawaiians, understood, cook, to, be, lono, and, the, evidence, presented, in, support, of, it, was, challenged, in, 1992, by, gananath, obeyesekere, in, the, so, called, sahlins, obeyesekere,

turned, his, back, to, help, launch, the, boats, he, was, struck, on, the, head, by, the, villagers, and, then, stabbed, to, death, as, he, fell, on, his, face, in, the, surf, he, was, first, struck, on, the, head, with, a, club, by, a, chief, named, kalaimanokaho, owaha, or, kana, ina, namesake, of, charles, kana, ina, and, then, stabbed, by, one, of, the, king, s, attendants, nuaa, the,

them, to, retain, his, body, following, their, practice, of, the, time, they, prepared, his, body, with, funerary, rituals, usually, reserved, for, the, chiefs, and, highest, elders, of, the, society, the, body, was, disembowelled, and, baked, to, facilitate, removal, of, the, flesh, and, the, bones, were, carefully, cleaned, for, preservation, as, religious, icons, in, a, fashion, somewhat, reminiscent, of, the, treatment, of, european, saints, in, the, middle, ages, some, of, cook, s, remains, thus, preserved, were, eventually, returned, to, his, crew, for, a, formal, burial, at, sea,

instrument, such, as, a, backstaff, or, quadrant, longitude, was, more, difficult, to, measure, accurately, because, it, requires, precise, knowledge, of, the, time, difference, between, points, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, earth, turns, a, full, 360, degrees, relative, to, the, sun, each, day, thus, longitude, corresponds, to, time, 15, degrees, every, hour, or, 1, degree, every, 4,
