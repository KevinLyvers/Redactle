as, sculptures, and, paintings, he, never, regarded, himself, as, an, artist, seeing, painting, and, sculpture, as, branches, of, the, tree, whose, trunk, is, architecture, aalto, s, early, career, ran, in, parallel, with, the, rapid, economic, growth, and, industrialization, of, finland, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, many, of, his, clients, were, industrialists, among, them, the, ahlstr, m, gullichsen, family, who, became, his, patrons, the, span, of, his, career, from, the, 1920s, to, the, 1970s, is, reflected, in, the, styles, of, his, work, ranging, from, nordic,

throughout, his, entire, career, is, characterized, by, a, concern, for, design, as, gesamtkunstwerk, a, total, work, of, art, in, which, he, together, with, his, first, wife, aino, aalto, would, design, not, only, the, building, but, the, interior, surfaces, furniture, lamps, and, glassware, as, well, his, furniture, designs, are, considered, scandinavian, modern, an, aesthetic, reflected, in, their, elegant, simplification, and, concern, for, materials, especially, wood, but, also, in, aalto, s, technical, innovations, which, led, him, to, receiving, patents, for, various, manufacturing, processes, such, as, those, used, to, produce, bent, wood, as, a, designer, he, is, celebrated, as, a, forerunner, of, midcentury, modernism, in, design, his, invention, of, bent,

work, reflects, a, deep, desire, to, humanize, architecture, through, an, unorthodox, handling, of, form, and, materials, that, was, both, rational, and, intuitive, influenced, by, the, so, called, international, style, modernism, or, functionalism, as, it, was, called, in, finland, and, his, acquaintance, with, leading, modernists, in, europe, including, swedish, architect, erik, gunnar, asplund, and, many, of, the, artists, and, architects, associated, with, the, bauhaus, aalto, created, designs, that, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, trajectory, of, modernism, before, and, after,

1978, the, museum, of, finnish, architecture, in, helsinki, arranged, a, major, exhibition, of, aalto, s, works, although, he, is, sometimes, regarded, as, among, the, first, and, most, influential, architects, of, nordic, modernism, closer, examination, reveals, that, aalto, while, a, pioneer, in, finland, closely, followed, and, had, personal, contacts, with, other, pioneers, in, sweden, in, particular, gunnar, asplund, and, sven, markelius, what, they, and, many, others, of, that, generation, in, the, nordic, countries, shared, was, a, classical, education, and, an, approach, to, classical, architecture, that, historians, now, call, nordic, classicism, it, was, a, style, that, had, been, a, reaction, to, the, previous, dominant, style, of, national, romanticism, before, moving, in, the, late, 1920s, towards, modernism, upon, returning, to, jyv, skyl, in, 1923, to, establish, his, own, architect, s, office, aalto, designed, several, single, family, homes, designed, in, the, style, of, nordic, classicism, for, example, the, manor, like, house, for, his, mother, s, cousin, terho, manner, in, t, ysa, 1923, a, summer, villa, for, the, jyv, skyl, chief, constable, also, from, 1923, and, the, alatalo, farmhouse, in, tarvaala, 1924, during, this, period, he, completed, his, first, public, buildings, the, jyv, skyl, workers, club, in, 1925, the, jyv, skyl, defence, corps, building, in, 1926, and, the, sein, joki, civil, guard, house, building, in, 1924, 29, he, entered, several, architectural, competitions, for, prestigious, state, public, buildings, in, finland, and, abroad, this, included, two, competitions, for, the, finnish, parliament, building, in, 1923, and, 1924, the, extension, to, the, university, of, helsinki, in, 1931, and, the, building, to, house, the, league, of, nations, in, geneva, switzerland, in, 1926, 27, aalto, s, first, church, design, to, be, completed, muurame, church, illustrates, his, transition, from, nordic, classicism, to, functionalism, this, was, the, period, when, aalto, was, most, prolific, in, his, writings, with, articles, for, professional, journals, and, newspapers, among, his, most, well, known, essays, from, this, period, are, urban, culture, 1924, temple, baths, on, jyv, skyl, ridge, 1925, abb, coignard, s, sermon, 1925, and, from, doorstep, to, living, room, 1926, the, shift, in, aalto, s, design, approach, from, classicism, to, modernism, is, epitomised, by, the, viipuri, library, in, vyborg, 1927, 35, which, went, through, a, transformation, from, an, originally, classical, competition, entry, proposal, to, the, completed, high, modernist, building, his, humanistic, approach, is, in, full, evidence, in, the, library, the, interior, displays, natural, materials, warm, colours, and, undulating, lines, due, to, problems, related, to, financing, compounded, by, a, change, of, site, the, viipuri, library, project, lasted, eight, years, during, that, time, aalto, designed, the, standard, apartment, building, 1928, 29, in, turku, the, turun, sanomat, building, 1929, 30, and, the, paimio, sanatorium, 1929, 32, which, he, designed, in, collaboration, with, his, first, wife, aino, aalto, a, number, of, factors, contributed, to, aalto, s, shift, towards, modernism, his, increased, familiarity, with, international, trends, facilitated, by, his, travels, throughout, europe, the, opportunity, to, experiment, with, concrete, prefabrication, in, the, standard, apartment, building, the, cutting, edge, le, corbusier, inspired, formal, language, of, the, turun, sanomat, building, and, aalto, s, application, of, both, in, the, paimio, sanatorium, and, in, the, ongoing, design, for, the, library, although, the, turun, sanomat, building, and, paimio, sanatorium, are, comparatively, pure, modernist, works, they, carried, the, seeds, of, his, questioning, of, such, an, orthodox, modernist, approach, and, a, move, to, a, more, daring, synthetic, attitude, it, has, been, pointed, out, that, the, planning, principle, for, paimio, sanatorium, the, splayed, wings, was, indebted, to, the, zonnestraal, sanatorium, 1925, 31, by, jan, duiker, which, aalto, visited, while, it, was, under, construction, while, these, early, functionalist, bear, hallmarks, of, influences, from, le, corbusier, walter, gropius, and, other, key, modernist, figures, of, central, europe, aalto, nevertheless, started, to, show, his, individuality, in, a, departure, from, such, norms, with, the, introduction, of, organic, references, through, sven, markelius, aalto, became, a, member, of, the, congres, internationaux, d, architecture, moderne, ciam, attending, the, second, congress, in, frankfurt, in, 1929, and, the, fourth, congress, in, athens, in, 1933, where, he, established, a, close, friendship, with, l, szl, moholy, nagy, sigfried, giedion, and, philip, morton, shand, it, was, during, this, time, that, he, closely, followed, the, work, of, the, main, force, driving, the, new, modernism, le, corbusier, visiting, him, in, his, paris, office, several, times, in, the, following, years, it, was, not, until, the, completion, of, the, paimio, sanatorium, 1932, and, viipuri, library, 1935, that, aalto, first, achieved, world, attention, in, architecture, his, reputation, grew, in, the, us, following, the, invitation, to, hold, a, retrospective, exhibition, of, his, works, at, moma, in, new, york, in, 1938, this, was, his, first, visit, to, the, states, the, exhibition, which, later, went, on, a, 12, city, tour, of, the, country, was, a, landmark, aalto, was, the, second, ever, architect, after, le, corbusier, to, have, a, solo, exhibition, at, the, museum, his, reputation, grew, in, the, us, following, the, critical, reception, of, his, design, for, the, finnish, pavilion, at, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, described, by, frank, lloyd, wright, as, a, work, of, genius, it, could, be, said, that, aalto, s, international, reputation, was, sealed, with, his, inclusion, in, the, second, edition, of, sigfried, giedion, s, influential, book, on, modernist, architecture, space, time, and, architecture, the, growth, of, a, new, tradition, 1949, in, which, aalto, received, more, attention, than, any, other, modernist, architect, including, le, corbusier, in, his, analysis, of, aalto, giedion, gave, primacy, to, qualities, that, depart, from, direct, functionality, such, as, mood, atmosphere, intensity, of, life, and, even, national, characteristics, declaring, that, finland, is, with, aalto, wherever, he, goes, during, the, 1930s, alvar, spent, some, time, experimenting, with, laminated, wood, sculpture, and, abstract, relief, characterized, by, irregular, curved, forms, utilizing, this, knowledge, he, was, able, to, solve, technical, problems, concerning, the, flexibility, of, wood, while, at, the, same, time, working, out, spatial, issues, in, his, designs, aalto, s, early, experiments, with, wood, and, his, move, away, from, a, purist, modernism, would, be, tested, in, built, form, with, the, commission, to, design, villa, mairea, 1939, in, noormarkku, the, luxury, home, of, young, industrialist, couple, harry, and, maire, gullichsen, it, was, maire, gullichsen, who, acted, as, the, main, client, and, she, worked, closely, not, only, with, alvar, but, also, with, aino, aalto, on, the, design, encouraging, them, to, be, more, daring, in, their, work, the, building, forms, a, u, shape, around, a, central, inner, garden, whose, central, feature, is, a, kidney, shaped, swimming, pool, adjacent, to, the, pool, is, a, sauna, executed, in, a, rustic, style, alluding, to, both, finnish, and, japanese, precedents, the, design, of, the, house, is, a, synthesis, of, numerous, stylistic, influences, from, traditional, finnish, vernacular, to, purist, modernism, as, well, as, influences, from, english, and, japanese, architecture, while, the, house, is, clearly, intended, for, a, wealthy, family, aalto, nevertheless, argued, that, it, was, also, an, experiment, that, would, prove, useful, in, the, design, of, mass, housing, his, increased, fame, led, to, offers, and, commissions, outside, finland, in, 1941, he, accepted, an, invitation, as, a, visiting, professor, to, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, in, the, us, during, the, second, world, war, he, returned, to, finland, to, direct, the, reconstruction, office, after, the, war, he, returned, to, mit, where, he, designed, the, student, dormitory, baker, house, completed, in, 1949, the, dormitory, flanked, the, charles, river, and, its, undulating, form, provided, maximum, view, and, ventilation, for, each, resident, this, was, the, first, building, of, aalto, s, redbrick, period, originally, used, in, baker, house, to, signify, the, ivy, league, university, tradition, aalto, went, on, to, use, it, in, a, number, of, key, buildings, after, his, return, to, finland, most, notably, in, several, of, the, buildings, in, the, new, helsinki, university, of, technology, campus, starting, in, 1950, s, yn, tsalo, town, hall, 1952, helsinki, pensions, institute, 1954, helsinki, house, of, culture, 1958, as, well, as, in, his, own, summer, house, the, experimental, house, in, muuratsalo, 1957, in, the, 1950s, aalto, immersed, himself, in, sculpting, exploring, wood, bronze, marble, and, mixed, media, among, the, notable, works, from, this, period, is, his, 1960, memorial, to, the, battle, of, suomussalmi, located, on, the, battlefield, it, consists, of, a, leaning, bronze, pillar, on, a, pedestal, foremost, among, aalto, s, work, from, the, early, 1960s, until, his, death, in, 1976, were, his, projects, in, helsinki, in, particular, the, huge, town, plan, for, the, void, in, the, centre, of, helsinki, adjacent, to, t, l, bay, and, the, vast, railway, yards, an, area, marked, on, the, edges, by, significant, buildings, such, as, the, national, museum, and, the, main, railway, station, both, by, eliel, saarinen, in, his, town, plan, aalto, proposed, a, line, of, separate, marble, clad, buildings, fronting, the, bay, which, would, house, various, cultural, institutions, including, a, concert, hall, opera, museum, of, architecture, and, headquarters, for, the, finnish, academy, the, scheme, also, extended, into, the, kamppi, district, with, a, series, of, tall, office, blocks, aalto, first, presented, his, vision, in, 1961, but, it, went, through, various, modifications, during, the, early, 60s, only, two, fragments, of, the, overall, plan, were, realized, the, finlandia, hall, concert, hall, 1976, fronting, on, t, l, bay, and, an, office, building, in, the, kamppi, district, for, the, helsinki, electricity, company, 1975,

the, academic, bookstore, 1962, and, the, syp, bank, building, 1969, following, aalto, s, death, in, 1976, his, office, continued, to, operate, under, the, direction, of, his, widow, elissa, who,

vienna, workshop, and, worked, for, a, time, under, eliel, saarinen, he, also, drew, inspiration, from, gebr, der, thonet, during, the, late, 1920s, and, 1930s, he, worked, closely, with, aino, aalto, on, his, furniture, designs, a, focus, due, in, part, to, his, decision, to, design, many, of, the, individual, furniture, pieces, and, lamps, for, the, paimio, sanatorium, of, particular, significance, was, the, aaltos, experimentation, in, bent, plywood, chairs, most, notably, the, so, called, paimio, chair, designed, for, tuberculosis, patients, and, the, model, 60, stacking, stool,

personal, synthetic, and, idiosyncratic, modernism, aalto, s, wide, field, of, design, activity, ranges, from, large, scale, projects, such, as, city, planning, and, architecture, to, more, intimate, human, scale, work, in, interior, design, furniture, and, glassware, design, and, painting, it, has, been, estimated, that, during, his, entire, career, aalto, designed, over, 500, individual,

with, wood, was, influenced, by, early, scandinavian, architects, his, experiments, and, bold, departures, from, aesthetic, norms, brought, attention, to, his, ability, to, make, wood, do, things, not, previously, done, his, techniques, in, the, way, he, cut, beech, wood, for, example, and, his, ability, to, use, plywood, as, a, structural, element, while, at, the, same, time, exploiting, its,

forest, by, binding, beech, wood, with, withes, into, columns, aalto, claimed, that, his, paintings, were, not, made, as, individual, artworks, but, as, part, of, his, process, of, architectural, design, and, many, of, his, small, scale, sculptural, experiments, with, wood, led, to, later, larger, architectural, details, and, forms, these, experiments, also, led, to, a, number, of, patents,

required, for, a, product, workshop, or, special, event, aalto, was, also, influential, in, bringing, modern, art, to, the, attention, of, the, finnish, people, in, particular, the, work, of, his, friends, alexander, milne, calder, and, fernand, l, ger, as, mentioned, above, aalto, s, international, reputation, was, sealed, with, his, inclusion, in, the, second, edition, of, sigfried, giedion, s, influential, book, on, modernist, architecture, space, time, and, architecture, the, growth, of, a, new, tradition, 1949, in, which, aalto, received, more, attention, than, any, other, modernist, architect, including, le, corbusier, in, his, analysis, of, aalto, giedion, gave, primacy, to, qualities, that, depart, from, direct, functionality, such, as, mood, atmosphere, intensity, of, life, and, even, national, characteristics, declaring, that, finland, is, with, aalto, wherever, he, goes, more, recently, however, some, architecture, critics, and, historians, have, questioned, aalto, s, influence, on, the, historical, canon, the, italian, marxist, architecture, historians, manfredo, tafuri, and, francesco, dal, co, contend, that, aalto, s, historical, significance, has, perhaps, been, rather, exaggerated, with, aalto, we, are, outside, of, the, great, themes, that, have, made, the, course, of, contemporary, architecture, so, dramatic, the, qualities, of, his, works, have, a, meaning, only, as, masterful, distractions, not, subject, to, reproduction, outside, the, remote, reality, in, which, they, have, their, roots, at, the, heart, of, their, critique, was, the, perception, of, aalto, s, work, as, unsuited, to, the, urban, context, essentially, his, architecture, is, not, appropriate, to, urban, typologies, at, the, other, end, of, the, political, spectrum, though, similarly, concerned, with, the, appropriateness, of, aalto, s, formal, language, the, american, cultural, theorist, and, architectural, historian, charles, jencks, singled, out, his, pensions, institute, as, an, example, of, what, he, termed, the, architect, s, soft, paternalism, conceived, as, a, fragmented, mass, to, break, up, the, feeling, of, bureaucracy, it, succeeds, all, too, well, in, being, humane, and, killing, the, pensioner, with, kindness, the, forms, are, familiar, red, brick, and, ribbon, strip, windows, broken, by, copper, and, bronze, elements, all, carried, through, with, a, literal, mindedness, that, borders, on, the, soporific, during, his, lifetime, aalto, faced, criticisms, from, his, fellow, architects, in, finland, most, notably, kirmo, mikkola, and, juhani, pallasmaa, by, the, last, decade, of, aalto, s, life, his, work, was, seen, as, unfashionably, individualistic, at, a, time, when, the, opposing, tendencies, of, rationalism, and, constructivism, often, championed, under, left, wing, politics, argued, for, anonymous, aggressively, non, aesthetic, architecture, of, aalto, s, late, works, mikkola, wrote, aalto, has, moved, to, baroque, line, aalto, has, been, commemorated, in, a, number, of, ways, g, ran, schildt, has, written, and, edited, many, books, on, aalto, the, most, well, known, being, the, three, volume,
