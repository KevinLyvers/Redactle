attraction, and, repulsion, he, began, with, an, enormous, advantage, and, exploited, it, to, the, utmost, he, headed, the, one, institution, that, stood, for, the, polar, opposite, of, the, communist, way, of, life, that, the, polish, people, hated, he, was, a, pole, but, beyond, the, regime, s, reach, by, identifying, with, him, poles, would, have, the, chance, to, cleanse, themselves, of, the, compromises, they, had, to, make, to, live, under, the, regime, and, so, they, came, to, him, by, the, millions, they, listened, he, told, them, to, be, good, not, to, compromise, themselves, to, stick, by, one, another, to, be, fearless, and, that, god, is, the, only, source, of, goodness, the, only, standard, of, conduct, be, not, afraid, he, said, millions, shouted, in, response, we,

this, holy, year, 2000, as, an, important, appointment, i, thought, of, its, celebration, as, a, providential, opportunity, during, which, the, church, thirty, five, years, after, the, second,

importance, of, starting, afresh, from, christ, no, we, shall, not, be, saved, by, a, formula, but, by, a, person, in, the, splendour, of, the, truth, veritatis, splendor, he, emphasised, the,

apostolic, letters, and, exhortations, john, paul, ii, talked, about, the, dignity, and, the, equality, of, women, he, argued, for, the, importance, of, the, family, for, the, future, of, humanity, other, encyclicals, include, the, gospel, of, life, evangelium, vitae, and, ut, unum, sint, that, they, may, be, one, though, critics, accused, him, of, inflexibility, in, explicitly, re, asserting, catholic, moral, teachings, against, abortion, and, euthanasia, that, have, been, in, place, for, well, over, a, thousand, years, he, urged, a, more, nuanced, view, of, capital, punishment, in, his, second, encyclical, dives, in, misericordia, he, stressed, that, divine, mercy, is, the, greatest, feature, of, god, needed, especially, in, modern, times, john, paul, ii, was, considered, a, conservative, on, doctrine, and, issues, relating, to, human, sexual, reproduction, and, the, ordination, of, women, while, he, was, visiting, the, united, states, in, 1977, the, year, before,

during, his, wednesday, audiences, in, rome, between, september, 1979, and, november, 1984, were, later, compiled, and, published, as, a, single, work, titled, theology, of, the, body, an, extended, meditation, on, human, sexuality, he, extended, it, to, the, condemnation, of, abortion, euthanasia, and, virtually, all, capital, punishment, calling, them, all, a, part, of, a, struggle, between, a, culture, of, life, and, a, culture, of, death, he, campaigned, for, world, debt, forgiveness, and, social, justice, he, coined, the, term, social, mortgage, which, related, that, all, private,

was, present, and, very, influential, at, the, 1962, 65, second, vatican, council, affirmed, the, teachings, of, that, council, and, did, much, to, implement, them, nevertheless, his, critics, often, wished, that, he, would, embrace, what, has, been, called, a, progressive, agenda, that, some, hoped, would, evolve, as, a, result, of, the, council, in, fact, the, council, did, not, advocate, progressive, changes, in, these, areas, for, example, they, still, condemned, abortion, as, an, unspeakable, crime, john, paul, ii, continued, to, declare, that, contraception, abortion, and, homosexual, acts, were, gravely, sinful, and, along, with, joseph, ratzinger, future, pope, benedict, xvi, initially, opposed, liberation, theology, following, the, church, s, exaltation, of, the,

that, it, was, in, every, instance, profaned, by, contraception, abortion, divorce, followed, by, a, second, marriage, and, by, homosexual, acts, in, 1994, john, paul, ii, asserted, the, church, s, lack, of, authority, to, ordain, women, to, the, priesthood, stating, that, without, such, authority, ordination, is, not, legitimately, compatible, with, fidelity, to, christ, this, was, also, deemed, a, repudiation, of, calls, to, break, with, the, constant, tradition, of, the, church, by, ordaining, women, to, the, priesthood, in, addition, john, paul, ii, chose, not, to, end, the, discipline, of, mandatory, priestly, celibacy, although, in, a, small, number, of, unusual, circumstances, he, did, allow, certain, married, clergymen, of, other, christian, traditions, who, later,

the, death, penalty, although, previous, popes, had, accepted, the, practice, at, a, papal, mass, in, st, louis, missouri, in, the, united, states, he, said, a, sign, of, hope, is, the, increasing, recognition, that, the, dignity, of, human, life, must, never, be, taken, away, even, in, the, case, of, someone, who, has, done, great, evil, modern, society, has, the, means, of, protecting, itself, without, definitively, denying, criminals, the, chance, to, reform, i, renew, the, appeal, i, made, most, recently, at, christmas, for, a, consensus, to, end, the, death, penalty, which, is, both, cruel, and, unnecessary, during, that, visit, john, paul, ii, convinced, the, then, governor, of, missouri, mel, carnahan, to, reduce, the, death, sentence, of, convicted, murderer, darrell, j, mease,

president, alfonso, portillo, for, a, moratorium, on, executions, john, paul, ii, taught, on, the, environmental, health, of, earth, that, humanity, has, disappointed, god, s, expectations, degrading, that, flowerbed, which, is, the, earth, our, dwelling, place, his, phrase, and, exhortation, ecological, conversion, which, was, used, in, a, general, audience, in, the, vatican, in, 2001, has, been, widely, adopted, for, example, in, the, mandate, for, catholic, earthcare, australia, and, in, the, writings, of, pope, francis, john, paul, ii, pushed, for, a, reference, to, europe, s, christian, cultural, roots, in, the, draft, of, the, european, constitution, in, his, 2003, apostolic, exhortation, ecclesia, in, europa, john, paul, ii, wrote, that, he, fully, respected, the, secular, nature, of, european, institutions, however, he, wanted, the, constitution, to, enshrine, religious, rights, including, acknowledging, the, rights, of, religious, groups, to, organise, freely, recognise, the, specific, identity, of, each, denomination, and, allow, for, a, structured, dialogue, between, each, religious, community, and, the, european, union, eu, and, extend, across, the, eu, the, legal, status, enjoyed, by, religious, institutions, in, individual, member, states, john, paul, ii, said, i, wish, once, more, to, appeal, to, those, drawing, up, the, future, european, constitutional, treaty, so, that, it, will, include, a, reference, to, the, religion, and, in, particular, to, the, christian, heritage, of, europe, the, pope, s, desire, for, a, reference, to, europe, s, christian, identity, in, the, eu, constitution, was, supported, by, non, catholic, representatives, of, the, church, of, england, and, eastern, orthodox, churches, from, russia, romania, and, greece, john, paul, ii, s, demand, to, include, a, reference, to, europe, s, christian, roots, in, the, european, constitution, was, supported, by, some, non, christians, such, as, joseph, weiler, a, practising, orthodox, jew, and, renowned, constitutional, lawyer, who, said, that, the, eu, constitution, s, lack, of, a, reference, to, christianity, was, not, a, demonstration, of, neutrality, but, rather, a, jacobin, attitude, at, the, same, time, john, paul, ii, was, an, enthusiastic, supporter, of, european, integration, in, particular, he, supported, his, native, poland, s, entry, into, the, bloc, on, 19, may, 2003, three, weeks, before, a, referendum, was, held, in, poland, on, eu, membership, the, polish, pope, addressed, his, compatriots, and, urged, them, to, vote, for, poland, s, eu, membership, at, st, peter, s, square, in, vatican, city, state, while, some, conservative, catholic, politicians, in, poland, opposed, eu, membership, john, paul, ii, said, i, know, that, there, are, many, in, opposition, to, integration, i, appreciate, their, concern, about, maintaining, the, cultural, and, religious, identity, of, our, nation, however, i, must, emphasise, that, poland, has, always, been, an, important, part, of, europe, europe, needs, poland, the, church, in, europe, needs, the, poles, testimony, of, faith, poland, needs, europe, the, polish, pope, compared, poland, s, entry, into, the, eu, to, the, union, of, lublin, which, was, signed, in, 1569, and, united, the, kingdom, of, poland, and, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, into, one, nation, and, created, an, elective, monarchy, on, 22, october, 1996, in, a, speech, to, the, pontifical, academy, of, sciences, plenary, session, at, the, vatican, john, paul, ii, said, of, evolution, that, this, theory, has, been, progressively, accepted, by, researchers, following, a, series, of, discoveries, in, various, fields, of, knowledge, the, convergence, neither, sought, nor, fabricated, of, the, results, of, work, that, was, conducted, independently, is, in, itself, a, significant, argument, in, favour, of, this, theory, john, paul, ii, s, embrace, of, evolution, was, enthusiastically, praised, by, american, palaeontologist, and, evolutionary, biologist, stephen, jay, gould, with, whom, he, had, an, audience, in, 1984, although, generally, accepting, the, theory, of, evolution, john, paul, ii, made, one, major, exception, the, human, soul, saying, if, the, human, body, has, its, origin, in, living, material, which, pre, exists, it, the, spiritual, soul, is, immediately, created, by, god, in, 2003, john, paul, ii, criticised, the, 2003, united, states, led, invasion, of, iraq, saying, in, his, state, of, the, world, address, no, to, war, war, is, not, always, inevitable, it, is, always, a, defeat, for, humanity, he, sent, cardinal, pio, laghi, the, former, apostolic, pro, nuncio, to, the, united, states, to, talk, with, george, w, bush, the, us, president, to, express, opposition, to, the, war, john, paul, ii, said, that, it, was, up, to, the, united, nations, to, solve, the, international, conflict, through, diplomacy, and, that, a, unilateral, aggression, is, a, crime, against, peace, and, a, violation, of, international, law, the, pope, s, opposition, to, the, iraq, war, led, to, him, being, a, candidate, to, win, the, 2003, nobel, peace, prize, which, was, ultimately, awarded, to, iranian, attorney, judge, and, noted, human, rights, advocate, shirin, ebadi, in, 1984, and, 1986, through, cardinal, ratzinger, future, pope, benedict, xvi, as, prefect, of, the, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, john, paul, ii, officially, condemned, aspects, of, liberation, theology, which, had, many, followers, in, latin, america, visiting, europe, salvadoran, archbishop, scar, romero, unsuccessfully, advocated, for, the, vatican, to, condemn, the, right, wing, military, regime, of, el, salvador, for, violations, of, human, rights, during, the, salvadoran, civil, war, and, the, support, of, death, squads, though, romero, expressed, his, frustration, at, working, with, clergy, who, cooperated, with, the, government, john, paul, ii, encouraged, him, to, maintain, episcopal, unity, as, a, top, priority, in, his, travel, to, managua, nicaragua, in, 1983, john, paul, ii, harshly, condemned, what, he, dubbed, the, popular, church, referencing, the, ecclesial, base, communities, supported, by, the, latin, american, episcopal, conference, and, the, nicaraguan, clergy, s, tendencies, to, support, the, leftist, sandinistas, reminding, the, clergy, of, their, duties, of, obedience, to, the, holy, see, during, that, visit, ernesto, cardenal, a, priest, and, minister, in, the, sandinista, government, knelt, to, kiss, his, hand, john, paul, withdrew, it, wagged, his, finger, in, cardenal, s, face, and, told, him, you, must, straighten, out, your, position, with, the, church, however, in, march, 1986, the, vatican, published, an, instruction, on, the, subject, in, which, while, warning, against, reducing, the, salvific, dimension, of, liberation, to, the, socio, ethical, dimension, which, is, a, consequence, of, it, it, supported, the, special, option, for, the, poor, favored, by, the, liberation, theologians, and, described, the, basic, christian, communities, which, they, had, promoted, as, a, source, of, great, hope, for, the, church, a, few, weeks, later, the, pope, himself, seemed, to, endorse, the, movement, when, he, wrote, to, the, brazilian, bishops, that, as, long, as, it, is, in, harmony, with, the, teaching, of, the, church, we, are, convinced, we, and, you, that, the, theology, of, liberation, is, not, only, timely, but, useful, and, necessary, it, should, constitute, a, new, state, in, close, connection, with, the, former, ones, of, theological, reflection, john, paul, ii, was, the, first, pontiff, to, denounce, mafia, violence, in, southern, italy, in, 1993, during, a, pilgrimage, to, agrigento, sicily, he, appealed, to, the, mafiosi, i, say, to, those, responsible, convert, one, day, the, judgement, of, god, will, arrive, in, 1994, john, paul, ii, visited, catania, and, told, victims, of, mafia, violence, to, rise, up, and, cloak, yourself, in, light, and, justice, in, 1995, the, mafia, bombed, two, historical, churches, in, rome, some, believed, that, this, was, the, mob, s, vendetta, against, the, pope, for, his, denunciations, of, organised, crime, between, 1990, and, 1991, a, 34, nation, coalition, led, by, the, united, states, waged, a, war, against, saddam, hussein, s, iraq, which, had, invaded, and, annexed, kuwait, john, paul, ii, was, a, staunch, opponent, of, the, gulf, war, throughout, the, conflict, he, appealed, to, the, international, community, to, stop, the, war, and, after, it, was, over, led, diplomatic, initiatives, to, negotiate, peace, in, the, middle, east, in, his, 1991, encyclical, centesimus, annus, john, paul, ii, harshly, condemned, the, conflict, no, never, again, war, which, destroys, the, lives, of, innocent, people, teaches, how, to, kill, throws, into, upheaval, even, the, lives, of, those, who, do, the, killing, and, leaves, behind, a, trail, of, resentment, and, hatred, thus, making, it, all, the, more, difficult, to, find, a, just, solution, of, the, very, problems, which, provoked, the, war, in, april, 1991, during, his, urbi, et, orbi, sunday, message, at, st, peter, s, basilica, john, paul, ii, called, for, the, international, community, to, lend, an, ear, to, the, long, ignored, aspirations, of, oppressed, peoples, he, specifically, named, the, kurds, a, people, who, were, fighting, a, civil, war, against, saddam, hussein, s, troops, in, iraq, as, one, such, people, and, referred, to, the, war, as, a, darkness, menacing, the, earth, during, this, time, the, vatican, had, expressed, its, frustration, with, the, international, ignoring, of, the, pope, s, calls, for, peace, in, the, middle, east, in, 1990, during, the, civil, war, between, tutsis, and, hutus, in, the, mostly, catholic, country, of, rwanda, john, paul, ii, called, for, a, ceasefire, and, condemned, the, persecution, of, the, tutsis, in, 1994, he, was, the, first, world, leader, to, condemn, the, massacre, of, the, tutsis, as, a, genocide, in, 1995, during, his, third, visit, to, kenya, before, an, audience, of, 300, 000, john, paul, ii, pleaded, for, an, end, to, the, violence, in, rwanda, and, burundi, urging, forgiveness, and, reconciliation, as, a, solution, to, the, genocide, he, told, rwandan, and, burundian, refugees, that, he, was, close, to, them, and, shared, their, immense, pain, he, said, what, is, happening, in, your, countries, is, a, terrible, tragedy, that, must, end, during, the, african, synod, we, the, pastors, of, the, church, felt, the, duty, to, express, our, consternation, and, to, launch, an, appeal, for, forgiveness, and, reconciliation, this, is, the, only, way, to, dissipate, the, threats, of, ethnocentrism, that, are, hovering, over, africa, these, days, and, that, have, so, brutally, touched, rwanda, and, burundi, while, taking, a, traditional, position, on, human, sexuality, maintaining, the, catholic, church, s, moral, opposition, to, homosexual, acts, john, paul, ii, asserted, that, people, with, homosexual, inclinations, possess, the, same, inherent, dignity, and, rights, as, others, in, his, book, memory, and, identity, he, referred, to, the, strong, pressures, by, the, european, parliament, to, recognise, homosexual, unions, as, an, alternative, type, of, family, with, the, right, to, adopt, children, in, the, book, as, quoted, by, reuters, he, wrote, it, is, legitimate, and, necessary, to, ask, oneself, if, this, is, not, perhaps, part, of, a, new, ideology, of, evil, more, subtle, and, hidden, perhaps, intent, upon, exploiting, human, rights, themselves, against, man, and, against, the, family, in, 1986, the, pope, approved, the, release, of, a, document, from, the, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, regarding, letter, to, the, bishops, of, the, catholic, church, on, the, pastoral, care, of, homosexual, persons, while, not, neglecting, to, comment, on, homosexuality, and, moral, order, the, letter, issued, multiple, affirmations, of, the, dignity, of, homosexual, persons, a, 1997, study,

teaching, catholic, doctrine, and, particularly, for, preparing, local, catechisms, it, was, meant, to, encourage, and, assist, in, the, writing, of, new, local, catechisms, rather, than, replacing, them, according, to, joaqu, n, navarro, valls, john, paul, ii, s, press, secretary, the, single, fact, of, john, paul, ii, s, election, in, 1978, changed, everything, in, poland, everything, began, not, in, east, germany, or, czechoslovakia, then, the, whole, thing, spread, why, in, 1980, did, they, lead, the, way, in, gdansk, why, did, they, decide, now, or, never, only, because, there, was, a, polish, pope, he, was, in, chile, and, pinochet, was, out, he, was, in, haiti, and, duvalier, was, out, he, was, in, the, philippines, and, marcos, was, out, on, many, of, those, occasions, people, would, come, here, to, the, vatican, thanking, the, holy, father, for, changing, things, before, john, paul, ii, s, pilgrimage, to, latin, america, during, a, meeting, with, reporters, he, criticised, augusto, pinochet, s, regime, as, dictatorial, in, the, words, of, the, new, york, times, he, used, unusually, strong, language, to, criticise, pinochet, and, asserted, to, journalists, that, the, catholic, church, in, chile, must, not, only, pray, but, actively, fight, for, the, restoration, of, democracy, in, chile, during, his, visit, to, chile, in, 1987, john, paul, ii, asked, chile, s, 31, catholic, bishops, to, campaign, for, free, elections, in, the, country, according, to, george, weigel, and, cardinal, stanis, aw, dziwisz, he, encouraged, pinochet, to, accept, a, democratic, opening, of, the, regime, and, may, even, have, called, for, his, resignation, according, to, monsignor, s, awomir, oder, the, postulator, of, john, paul, ii, s, beatification, cause, john, paul, s, words, to, pinochet, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, chilean, dictator, the, pope, confided, to, a, friend, i, received, a, letter, from, pinochet, in, which, he, told, me, that, as, a, catholic, he, had, listened, to, my, words, he, had, accepted, them, and, he, had, decided, to, begin, the, process, to, change, the, leadership, of, his, country, during, his, visit, to, chile, john, paul, ii, supported, the, vicariate, of, solidarity, the, church, led, pro, democracy, anti, pinochet, organisation, john, paul, ii, visited, the, vicariate, of, solidarity, s, offices, spoke, with, its, workers, and, called, upon, them, to, continue, their, work, emphasizing, that, the, gospel, consistently, urges, respect, for, human, rights, while, in, chile, john, paul, ii, made, gestures, of, public, support, of, chile, s, anti, pinochet, democratic, opposition, for, instance, he, hugged, and, kissed, carmen, gloria, quintana, a, young, student, who, had, been, nearly, burned, to, death, by, chilean, police, and, told, her, that, we, must, pray, for, peace, and, justice, in, chile, later, he, met, with, several, opposition, groups, including, those, that, had, been, declared, illegal, by, pinochet, s, government, the, opposition, praised, john, paul, ii, for, denouncing, pinochet, as, a, dictator, for, many, members, of, chile, s, opposition, were, persecuted, for, much, milder, statements, bishop, carlos, camus, one, of, the, harshest, critics, of, pinochet, s, dictatorship, within, the, chilean, church, praised, john, paul, ii, s, stance, during, the, papal, visit, saying, i, am, quite, moved, because, our, pastor, supports, us, totally, never, again, will, anyone, be, able, to, say, that, we, are, interfering, in, politics, when, we, defend, human, dignity, he, added, no, country, the, pope, has, visited, has, remained, the, same, after, his, departure, the, pope, s, visit, is, a, mission, an, extraordinary, social, catechism, and, his, stay, here, will, be, a, watershed, in, chilean, history, some, have, erroneously, accused, john, paul, ii, of, affirming, pinochet, s, regime, by, appearing, with, the, chilean, ruler, in, public, cardinal, roberto, tucci, the, organiser, of, john, paul, ii, s, visits, revealed, that, pinochet, tricked, the, pontiff, by, telling, him, he, would, take, him, to, his, living, room, while, in, reality, he, took, him, to, his, balcony, tucci, says, that, the, pontiff, was, furious, john, paul, ii, visited, haiti, on, 9, march, 1983, when, the, country, was, ruled, by, jean, claude, baby, doc, duvalier, he, bluntly, criticised, the, poverty, of, the, country, directly, addressing, baby, doc, and, his, wife, mich, le, bennett, in, front, of, a, large, crowd, of, haitians, yours, is, a, beautiful, country, rich, in, human, resources, but, christians, cannot, be, unaware, of, the, injustice, the, excessive, inequality, the, degradation, of, the, quality, of, life, the, misery, the, hunger, the, fear, suffered, by, the, majority, of, the, people, john, paul, ii, spoke, in, french, and, occasionally, in, creole, and, in, the, homily, outlined, the, basic, human, rights, that, most, haitians, lacked, the, opportunity, to, eat, enough, to, be, cared, for, when, ill, to, find, housing, to, study, to, overcome, illiteracy, to, find, worthwhile, and, properly, paid, work, all, that, provides, a, truly, human, life, for, men, and, women, for, young, and, old, following, john, paul, ii, s, pilgrimage, the, haitian, opposition, to, duvalier, frequently, reproduced, and, quoted, the, pope, s, message, shortly, before, leaving, haiti, john, paul, ii, called, for, social, change, in, haiti, by, saying, lift, up, your, heads, be, conscious, of, your, dignity, of, men, created, in, god, s, image, john, paul, ii, s, visit, inspired, massive, protests, against, the, duvalier, dictatorship, in, response, to, the, visit, 860, catholic, priests, and, church, workers, signed, a, statement, committing, the, church, to, work, on, behalf, of, the, poor, in, 1986, duvalier, was, deposed, in, an, uprising, the, collapse, of, the, dictatorship, of, general, alfredo, stroessner, of, paraguay, was, linked, among, other, things, to, john, paul, ii, s, visit, to, the, south, american, country, in, may, 1988, since, stroessner, s, taking, power, through, a, coup, d, tat, in, 1954, paraguay, s, bishops, increasingly, criticised, the, regime, for, human, rights, abuses, rigged, elections, and, the, country, s, feudal, economy, during, his, private, meeting, with, stroessner, john, paul, ii, told, the, dictator, politics, has, a, fundamental, ethical, dimension, because, it, is, first, and, foremost, a, service, to, man, the, church, can, and, must, remind, men, and, in, particular, those, who, govern, of, their, ethical, duties, for, the, good, of, the, whole, of, society, the, church, cannot, be, isolated, inside, its, temples, just, as, men, s, consciences, cannot, be, isolated, from, god, later, during, a, mass, john, paul, ii, criticised, the, regime, for, impoverishing, the, peasants, and, the, unemployed, saying, that, the, government, must, give, people, greater, access, to, the, land, although, stroessner, tried, to, prevent, him, from, doing, so, john, paul, ii, met, opposition, leaders, in, the, one, party, state, by, the, late, 1970s, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, had, been, predicted, by, some, observers, john, paul, ii, has, been, credited, with, being, instrumental, in, bringing, down, communism, in, central, and, eastern, europe, by, being, the, spiritual, inspiration, behind, its, downfall, and, catalyst, for, a, peaceful, revolution, in, poland, lech, wa, sa, the, founder, of, solidarity, and, the, first, post, communist, president, of, poland, credited, john, paul, ii, with, giving, poles, the, courage, to, demand, change, according, to, wa, sa, before, his, pontificate, the, world, was, divided, into, blocs, nobody, knew, how, to, get, rid, of, communism, in, warsaw, in, 1979, he, simply, said, do, not, be, afraid, and, later, prayed, let, your, spirit, descend, and, change, the, image, of, the, land, this, land, it, has, also, been, widely, alleged, that, the, vatican, bank, covertly, funded, solidarity, in, 1984, the, foreign, policy, of, the, ronald, reagan, administration, saw, opened, diplomatic, relations, with, the, vatican, for, the, first, time, since, 1870, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, long, history, of, strong, domestic, opposition, this, time, there, was, very, little, opposition, from, congress, the, courts, and, protestant, groups, relations, between, reagan, and, john, paul, ii, were, close, especially, because, of, their, shared, anti, communism, and, keen, interest, in, forcing, the, soviets, out, of, poland, reagan, s, correspondence, with, the, pope, reveals, a, continuous, scurrying, to, shore, up, vatican, support, for, u, s, policies, perhaps, most, surprisingly, the, papers, show, that, as, late, as, 1984, the, pope, did, not, believe, the, communist, polish, government, could, be, changed, no, one, can, prove, conclusively, that, he, was, a, primary, cause, of, the, end, of, communism, however, the, major, figures, on, all, sides, not, just, lech, wa, sa, the, polish, solidarity, leader, but, also, solidarity, s, arch, opponent, general, wojciech, jaruzelski, not, just, the, former, american, president, george, bush, senior, but, also, the, former, soviet, president, mikhail, gorbachev, now, agree, that, he, was, i, would, argue, the, historical, case, in, three, steps, without, the, polish, pope, no, solidarity, revolution, in, poland, in, 1980, without, solidarity, no, dramatic, change, in, soviet, policy, towards, eastern, europe, under, gorbachev, without, that, change, no, velvet, revolutions, in, 1989, in, december, 1989, john, paul, ii, met, with, the, soviet, leader, mikhail, gorbachev, at, the, vatican, and, each, expressed, his, respect, and, admiration, for, the, other, gorbachev, once, said, the, collapse, of, the, iron, curtain, would, have, been, impossible, without, john, paul, ii, on, john, paul, ii, s, death, gorbachev, said, pope, john, paul, ii, s, devotion, to, his, followers, is, a, remarkable, example, to, all, of, us, on, 4, june, 2004, u, s, president, george, w, bush, presented, the, presidential, medal, of, freedom, the, united, states, highest, civilian, honour, to, john, paul, ii, during, a, ceremony, at, the, apostolic, palace, the, president, read, the, citation, that, accompanied, the, medal, which, recognised, this, son, of, poland, whose, principled, stand, for, peace, and, freedom, has, inspired, millions, and, helped, to, topple, communism, and, tyranny, after, receiving, the, award, john, paul, ii, said, may, the, desire, for, freedom, peace, a, more, humane, world, symbolised, by, this, medal, inspire, men, and, women, of, goodwill, in, every, time, and, place, in, 1983, poland, s, communist, government, unsuccessfully, tried, to, humiliate, john, paul, ii, by, falsely, saying, he, had, fathered, an, illegitimate, child, section, d, of, s, u, ba, bezpiecze, stwa, sb, the, security, service, had, an, action, named, triangolo, to, carry, out, criminal, operations, against, the, catholic, church, in, poland, the, operation, encompassed, all, polish, hostile, actions,

representatives, of, different, religions, and, denominations, spent, a, day, of, fasting, and, prayer, although, the, contact, between, the, holy, see, and, many, christians, of, the, east, had, never, totally, ceased, communion, had, been, interrupted, since, ancient, times, again, the, history, of, conflict, in, central, europe, was, a, complex, part, of, john, paul, ii, s, personal, cultural, heritage, which, made, him, all, the, more, determined, to, react, so, as, to, attempt, to, overcome, abiding, difficulties, given, that, relatively, speaking, the, holy, see, and, the, non, catholic, eastern, churches, are, close, in, many, points, of, faith, in, may, 1999, john, paul, ii, visited, romania, on, the, invitation, from, patriarch, teoctist, ar, pa, u, of, the, romanian,

catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, churches, regarding, latin, and, byzantine, traditions, was, clearly, of, great, personal, interest, for, many, years, john, paul, ii, sought, to, facilitate, dialogue, and, unity, stating, as, early, as, 1988, in, euntes, in, mundum, europe, has, two, lungs, it, will, never, breathe, easily, until, it, uses, both, of, them, during, his, 2001, travels,

private, 30, minute, meeting, the, two, spoke, publicly, christodoulos, read, a, list, of, 13, offences, of, the, catholic, church, against, the, eastern, orthodox, church, since, the, great, schism, including, the, sack, of, constantinople, by, the, fourth, crusade, in, 1204, and, bemoaned, the, lack, of, apology, from, the, catholic, church, saying, until, now, there, has, not, been, heard, a, single, request, for, pardon, for, the, maniacal, crusaders, of, the, 13th, century, the, pope, responded, by, saying, for, the, occasions, past, and, present, when, sons, and, daughters, of, the, catholic, church, have, sinned, by, action, or, omission, against, their, orthodox, brothers, and, sisters, may, the, lord, grant, us, forgiveness, to, which, christodoulos, immediately, applauded, john, paul, ii, said, that, the, sacking, of, constantinople, was, a, source, of, profound, regret, for, catholics, later, john, paul, ii, and, christodoulos, met, on, a, spot, where, paul, of, tarsus, had, once, preached, to, athenian, christians, they, issued, a, common, declaration, saying, we, shall, do, everything, in, our, power, so, that, the, christian, roots, of, europe, and, its,

that, those, who, practise, them, are, particularly, close, to, christianity, and, among, them, the, church, s, missionaries, also, find, it, easier, to, speak, a, common, language, is, there, perhaps, in, this, veneration, of, ancestors, a, kind, of, preparation, for, the, christian, faith, in, the, communion, of, saints, in, which, all, believers, whether, living, or, dead, form, a, single, community, a, single, body, there, is, nothing, strange, then, that, the, african, and, asian, animists, would, become, believers, in, christ, more, easily, than, followers, of, the, great,

inaction, the, scandal, came, to, a, head, when, sin, ad, o, connor, infamously, tore, up, a, photo, of, john, paul, ii, on, a, 3, october, 1992, episode, of, saturday, night, live, while, performing, an, a, capella, rendition, of, bob, marley, s, war, in, response, to, mounting, criticism, over, the, next, decade, john, paul, ii, stated, in, 2002, that, there, is, no, place, in, the, priesthood, and, religious, life, for, those, who, would, harm, the, young, the, catholic, church, instituted, reforms, to, prevent, future, abuse, by, requiring, background, checks, for, church, employees, and, because, a, significant, majority, of, victims, were, boys, disallowing, ordination, of, men, with, deep, seated, homosexual, tendencies, they, now, require, dioceses, faced, with, an, allegation, to, alert, the, authorities, conduct, an, investigation, and, remove, the, accused, from, duty, in, 2008, the, church, asserted, that, the, scandal, was, a, very, serious, problem, and, estimated, that, it, was, probably, caused, by, no, more, than, 1, per, cent, or, 5, 000, of, the, over, 500, 000, catholic, priests, worldwide, in, april, 2002, john, paul, ii, despite, being, frail, from, parkinson, s, disease, summoned, all, the, american, cardinals, to, the, vatican, to, discuss, possible, solutions, to, the, issue, of, sexual, abuse, in, the, american, church, he, asked, them, to, diligently, investigate, accusations, john, paul, ii, suggested, that, american, bishops, be, more, open, and, transparent, in, dealing, with, such, scandals, and, emphasised, the, role, of, seminary, training, to, prevent, sexual, deviance, among, future, priests, in, what, the, new, york, times, called, unusually, direct, language, john, paul, condemned, the, arrogance, of, priests, that, led, to, the, scandals, priests, and, candidates, for, the, priesthood, often, live, at, a, level, both, materially, and, educationally, superior, to, that, of, their, families, and, the, members, of, their, own, age, group, it, is, therefore, very, easy, for, them, to, succumb, to, the, temptation, of, thinking, of, themselves, as, better, than, others, when, this, happens, the, ideal, of, priestly, service, and, self, giving, dedication, can, fade, leaving, the, priest, dissatisfied, and, disheartened, the, pope, read, a, statement, intended, for, the, american, cardinals, calling, the, sex, abuse, an, appalling, sin, and, said, the, priesthood, had, no, room, for, such, men, in, 2002, archbishop, juliusz, paetz, the, catholic, archbishop, of, pozna, was, accused, of, molesting, seminarians, john, paul, ii, accepted, his, resignation, and, placed, sanctions, on, him, prohibiting, paetz, from, exercising, his, ministry, as, bishop, it, was, reported, that, these, restrictions, were, lifted, though, vatican, spokesperson, federico, lombardi, strenuously, denied, this, saying, his, rehabilitation, was, without, foundation, in, 2003, john, paul, ii, reiterated, that, there, is, no, place, in, the, priesthood, and, religious, life, for, those, who, would, harm, the, young, in, april, 2003, a, three, day, conference, was, held, titled, abuse, of, children, and, young, people, by, catholic, priests, and, religious, where, eight, non, catholic, psychiatric, experts, were, invited, to, speak, to, near, all, vatican, dicasteries, representatives, the, panel, of, experts, overwhelmingly, opposed, implementation, of, policies, of, zero, tolerance, such, as, was, proposed, by, the, united, states, conference, of, catholic, bishops, one, expert, called, such, policies, a, case, of, overkill, since, they, do, not, permit, flexibility, to, allow, for, differences, among, individual, cases, in, 2004, john, paul, ii, recalled, bernard, francis, law, to, be, archpriest, of, the, papal, basilica, of, santa, maria, maggiore, law, had, previously, resigned, as, archbishop, of, boston, in, 2002, in, response, to, the, catholic, church, sexual, abuse, cases, after, church,

and, was, later, requested, by, the, vatican, to, withdraw, from, his, ministry, however, maciel, s, trial, began, in, 2004, during, the, pontificate, of, john, paul, ii, but, the, pope, died, before, it, ended, and, the, conclusions, were, known, in, an, interview, with, l, osservatore, romano, pope, francis, said, i, am, grateful, to, pope, benedict, who, dared, to, say, this, publicly, when, more, facts, began, to, come, to, light, after, degollado, s, death, in, 2008, pope, benedict, xvi, in, 2010, launched, another, investigation, and, on, 1, may, 2010, announced, a, declaration, about, the, crimes, of, the, founder, of, the, legionaries, and, to, pope, john, paul, ii, who, dared, to, give, the, green, light, to, the, legionaries, case, on, 10, november, 2020, the, vatican, published, a, report, which, found, that, john, paul, ii, learned, of, allegations, of, sexual, impropriety, against, former, cardinal, theodore, mccarrick, who, at, the, time, was, serving, as, archbishop, of, newark, through, a, 1999, letter, from, cardinal, john, o, connor, warning, him, that, appointing, mccarrick, to, be, archbishop, of, washington, d, c, a, position, which, had, recently, been, opened, would, be, a, mistake, john, paul, ii, ordered, an, investigation, which, stalled, when, three, of, the, four, bishops, tasked, with, investigating, claims, allegedly, brought,
