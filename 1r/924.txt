life, changed, radically, after, he, encountered, eustathius, of, sebaste, a, charismatic, bishop, and, ascetic, abandoning, his, legal, and, teaching, career, basil, devoted, his, life, to, god, in, a, letter, he, described, his, spiritual, awakening, i, had, wasted, much, time, on, follies, and, spent, nearly, all, of, my, youth, in, vain, labours, and, devotion, to, the, teachings, of, a, wisdom, that, god, had, made, foolish, suddenly, i, awoke, as, out, of, a, deep, sleep, i, beheld, the, wonderful, light, of, the, gospel, truth, and, i, recognized, the, nothingness, of, the, wisdom, of, the, princes, of, this, world, after, his, baptism, basil, traveled, in, 357, to, palestine, egypt, syria, and, mesopotamia, to, study, ascetics, and, monasticism, he, distributed, his, fortunes, among, the, poor, and, went, briefly, into, solitude, near, neocaesarea, of, pontus, modern, niksar, on, the, iris, basil, eventually, realized, that, while, he, respected, the, ascetics, piety, and, prayerfulness, the, solitary, life, did, not, call, him, eustathius, of, sebaste, a, prominent, anchorite, near, pontus, had, mentored, basil, however, they, also, eventually, differed, over, dogma, basil, instead, felt, drawn, toward, communal, religious, life, and, by, 358, he, was, gathering, around, him, a, group, of, like, minded, disciples, including, his, brother, peter, together, they, founded, a, monastic, settlement, on, his, family, s, estate, near, annesi, modern, sonusa, or, uluk, y, near, the, confluence, of, the, iris, and, lycos, rivers, his, widowed, mother, emmelia, sister, macrina, and, several, other, women, joined, basil, and, devoted, themselves, to, pious, lives, of, prayer, and, charitable, works, some, claim, macrina, founded, this, community, here, basil, wrote, about, monastic, communal, life, his, writings, became, pivotal, in, developing, monastic, traditions, of, the, eastern, church, in, 358, basil, invited, his, friend, gregory, of, nazianzus, to, join, him, in, annesi, when, gregory, eventually, arrived, they, collaborated, on, origen, s, philocalia, a, collection, of, origen, s, works, gregory, decided, to, return, to, his, family, in, nazianzus, basil, attended, the, council, of, constantinople, 360, he, at, first, sided, with, eustathius, and, the, homoiousians, a, semi, arian, faction, who, taught, that, the, son, was, of, like, substance, with, the, father, neither, the, same, one, substance, nor, different, from, him, the, homoiousians, opposed, the, arianism, of, eunomius, but, refused, to, join, with, the, supporters, of, the, nicene, creed, who, professed, that, the, members, of, the, trinity, were, of, one, substance, homoousios, however, basil, s, bishop, dianius, of, caesarea, had, subscribed, only, to, the, earlier, nicene, form, of, agreement, basil, eventually, abandoned, the, homoiousians, and, emerged, instead, as, a, strong, supporter, of, the, nicene, creed, his, ability, to, balance, his, theological, convictions, with, his, political, connections, made, basil, a, powerful, advocate, for, the, nicene, position, in, 362, bishop, meletius, of, antioch, ordained, basil, as, a, deacon, eusebius, then, summoned, basil, to, caesarea, and, ordained, him, as, presbyter, of, the, church, there, in, 365, eusebius, needed, him, as, an, assistant, because, of, his, intellectual, gifts, ecclesiastical, entreaties, rather, than, basil, s, desires, thus, altered, his, career, path, basil, and, gregory, nazianzus, spent, the, next, few, years, combatting, the, arian, heresy, which, threatened, to, divide, cappadocia, s, christians, in, close, fraternal, co, operation, they, agreed, to, a, great, rhetorical, contest, with, accomplished, arian, theologians, and, rhetors, in, the, subsequent, public, debates, presided, over, by, agents, of, valens, gregory, and, basil, emerged, triumphant, this, success, confirmed, for, both, gregory, and, basil, that, their, futures, lay, in, administration, of, the, church, basil, next, took, on, functional, administration, of, the, city, of, caesarea, eusebius, is, reported, as, becoming, jealous, of, the, reputation, and, influence, which, basil, quickly, developed, and, allowed, basil, to, return, to, his, earlier, solitude, later, however, gregory, persuaded, basil, to, return, basil, did, so, and, became, the, administrator, for, the, diocese, of, caesarea, in, 370, eusebius, died, and, basil, was, chosen, to, succeed, him, and, was, consecrated, as, a, bishop, on, 14, june, 370, his, new, post, as, bishop, of, caesarea, also, gave, him, the, powers, of, exarch, of, pontus, and, metropolitan, of, five, suffragan, bishops, many, of, whom, had, opposed, him, in, the, election, for, eusebius, s, successor, it, was, then, that, his, great, powers, were, called, into, action, hot, blooded, and, somewhat, imperious, basil, was, also, generous, and, sympathetic, he, personally, organized, a, soup, kitchen, and, distributed, food, to, the, poor, during, a, famine, following, a, drought, his, letters, show, that, he, actively, worked, to, reform, thieves, and, prostitutes, they, also, show, him, encouraging, his, clergy, not, to, be, tempted, by, wealth, or, the, comparatively, easy, life, of, a, priest, and, that, he, personally, took, care, in, selecting, worthy, candidates, for, holy, orders, he, also, had, the, courage, to, criticize, public, officials, who, failed, in, their, duty, of, administering, justice, at, the, same, time, he, preached, every, morning, and, evening, in, his, own, church, to, large, congregations, in, addition, to, all, the, above, he, built, a, large, complex, just, outside, caesarea, called, the, basiliad, which, included, a, poorhouse, hospice, and, hospital, and, was, compared, by, gregory, of, nazianzus, to, the, wonders, of, the, world, his, zeal, for, orthodoxy, did, not, blind, him, to, what, was, good, in, an, opponent, and, for, the, sake, of, peace, and, charity, he, was, content, to, waive, the, use, of, orthodox, terminology, when, it, could, be, surrendered, without, a, sacrifice, of, truth, the, emperor, valens, who, was, an, adherent, of, the, arian, philosophy, sent, his, prefect, modestus, to, at, least, agree, to, a, compromise, with, the, arian, faction, basil, s, adamant, negative, response, prompted, modestus, to, say, that, no, one, had, ever, spoken, to, him, in, that, way, before, basil, replied, perhaps, you, have, never, yet, had, to, deal, with, a, bishop, modestus, reported, back, to, valens, that, he, believed, nothing, short, of, violence, would, avail, against, basil, valens, was, apparently, unwilling, to, engage, in, violence, he, did, however, issue, orders, banishing, basil, repeatedly, none, of, which, succeeded, valens, came, himself, to, attend, when, basil, celebrated, the, divine, liturgy, on, the, feast, of, the, theophany, epiphany, and, at, that, time, was, so, impressed, by, basil, that, he, donated, to, him, some, land, for, the, building, of, the, basiliad, this, interaction, helped, to, define, the, limits, of, governmental, power, over, the, church, basil, then, had, to, face, the, growing, spread, of, arianism, this, belief, system, which, denied, that, christ, was, consubstantial, with, the, father, was, quickly, gaining, adherents, and, was, seen, by, many, particularly, those, in, alexandria, most, familiar, with, it, as, posing, a, threat, to, the, unity, of, the, church, basil, entered, into, connections, with, the, west, and, with, the, help, of, athanasius, he, tried, to, overcome, its, distrustful, attitude, toward, the, homoiousians, the, difficulties, had, been, enhanced, by, bringing, in, the, question, as, to, the, essence, of, the, holy, spirit, although, basil, advocated, objectively, the, consubstantiality, of, the, holy, spirit, with, the, father, and, the, son, he, belonged, to, those, who, faithful, to, eastern, tradition, would, not, allow, the, predicate, homoousios, to, the, former, for, this, he, was, reproached, as, early, as, 371, by, the, orthodox, zealots, among, the, monks, and, athanasius, defended, him, basil, corresponded, with, pope, damasus, in, the, hope, of, having, his, aid, and, encouragement, against, triumphant, arianism, the, pope, however, cherished, some, degree, of, suspicion, against, the, cappadocian, doctor, basil, died, before, the, factional, disturbances, ended, he, suffered, from, liver, disease, excessive, ascetic, practices, also, contributed, to, his, early, demise, historians, disagree, about, the, exact, date, basil, died, the, great, institute, before, the, gates, of, caesarea, the, ptochoptopheion, or, basileiad, which, was, used, as, poorhouse, hospital, and, hospice, became, a, lasting, monument, of, basil, s, episcopal, care, for, the, poor, many, of, st, basil, s, writings, and, sermons, specifically, on, the, topics, of, money, and, possessions, continue, to, influence, modern, christianity, the, principal, theological, writings, of, basil, are, his, on, the, holy, spirit, an, appeal, to, scripture, and, early, christian, tradition, to, prove, the, divinity, of, the, holy, spirit, and, his, refutation, of, the, apology, of, the, impious, eunomius, which, was, written, about, in, 364, and, comprised, three, books, against, eunomius, of, cyzicus, the, chief, exponent, of, anomoian, arianism, the, first, three, books, of, the, refutation, are, his, work, his, authorship, of, the, fourth, and, fifth, books, is, generally, considered, doubtful, he, was, a, famous, preacher, and, many, of, his, homilies, including, a, series, of, lenten, lectures, on, the, hexaemeron, also, hexa, meros, six, days, of, creation, latin, hexameron, and, an, exposition, of, the, psalter, have, been, preserved, some, like, that, against, usury, and, that, on, the, famine, in, 368, are, valuable, for, the, history, of, morals, others, illustrate, the, honor, paid, to, martyrs, and, relics, the, address, to, young, men, on, the, study, of, classical, literature, shows, that, basil, was, influenced, by, his, own, education, which, taught, him, to, appreciate, the, propaedeutic, importance, of, the, classics, in, one, of, his, homilies, he, describes, in, one, of, the, earliest, descriptions, of, desalination, how, sailors, in, his, time, obtain, fresh, water, by, hanging, sponges, over, a, vessel, with, boiling, seawater, and, collecting, and, condensing, the, water, vapor, in, his, exegesis, basil, was, an, admirer, of, origen, and, the, need, for, the, spiritual, interpretation, of, scripture, in, his, work, on, the, holy, spirit, he, asserts, that, to, take, the, literal, sense, and, stop, there, is, to, have, the, heart, covered, by, the, veil, of, jewish, literalism, lamps, are, useless, when, the, sun, is, shining, he, frequently, stresses, the, need, for, reserve, in, doctrinal, and, sacramental, matters, at, the, same, time, he, was, against, the, wild, allegories, of, some, contemporaries, concerning, this, he, wrote, i, know, the, laws, of, allegory, though, less, by, myself, than, from, the, works, of, others, there, are, those, truly, who, do, not, admit, the, common, sense, of, the, scriptures, for, whom, water, is, not, water, but, some, other, nature, who, see, in, a, plant, in, a, fish, what, their, fancy, wishes, who, change, the, nature, of, reptiles, and, of, wild, beasts, to, suit, their, allegories, like, the, interpreters, of, dreams, who, explain, visions, in, sleep, to, make, them, serve, their, own, end, his, ascetic, tendencies, are, exhibited, in, the, moralia, and, asketika, sometimes, mistranslated, as, rules, of, st, basil, ethical, manuals, for, use, in, the, world, and, the, cloister, respectively, there, has, been, a, good, deal, of, discussion, concerning, the, authenticity, of, the, two, works, known, as, the, greater, asketikon, and, the, lesser, asketikon, according, to, orosius, basil, taught, apocatastasis, entailing, the, restoration, of, all, sinners, to, christ, after, purification, this, doctrine, is, most, evident, in, his, commentary, on, isaiah, however, there, is, some, scholarly, dispute, about, this, commentary, and, if, it, should, truly, be, attributed, to, basil, on, the, other, hand, he, vehemently, opposed, the, view, that, hell, has, an, end, in, his, short, regulae, even, claiming, that, the, many, people, who, hold, it, are, deceived, by, the, devil, however, the, notion, of, a, finite, hell, was, also, espoused, by, his, siblings, macrina, and, gregory, of, nyssa, and, potentially, by, his, dear, friend, gregory, of, nazianzus, it, is, probable, that, the, relevant, passage, in, regulae, was, interpolated, the, passage, also, seems, to, include, ideas, that, could, be, considered, in, opposition, to, ideas, in, basil, s, undisputed, writings, for, example, the, notion, of, physical, punishments, in, hell, and, of, hell, itself, as, a, physical, place, with, different, locations, as, well, as, potentially, being, in, contradiction, to, most, of, basil, s, linguistic, use, in, his, book, de, spiritu, sancto, basil, lists, some, who, for, him, are, illustrious, men, of, the, church, and, quotes, them, these, are, irenaeus, of, lyon, clement, of, rome, dionysius, of, rome, dionysius, of, alexandria, eusebius, julius, africanus, gregory, thaumaturgus, firmilian, and, origen, basil, also, stresses, the, complete, equality, of, both, genders, deriving, from, the, same, human, lump, both, in, the, image, of, god, endowed, with, the, same, honour, and, dignity, in, perfect, equality, men, even, risk, being, inferior, in, piety, homily, on, julitta, 241b, likewise, in, homilies, on, psalms, 1, pg, 29, 216, 17, he, insists, on, the, socratic, and, stoic, tenet, here, christianized, that, man, and, woman, have, one, and, the, same, virtue, and, one, and, the, same, nature, their, common, creation, was, of, equal, honour, and, dignity, they, have, the, same, capacity, and, activity, and, will, be, given, the, same, reward, similarly, in, letter, to, amphilochius, 188, basil, again, uses, in, reference, to, the, equality, of, women, and, men, basil, faced, the, slavery, issue, in, de, spiritu, sancto, 20, in, the, context, of, a, trinitarian, debate, basil, recognizes, that, no, human, is, a, slave, by, nature, this, principle, countered, aristotle, s, conviction, and, was, consistent, with, gregory, of, nyssa, view, and, with, that, of, many, other, patristic, thinkers, even, augustine, and, theodoret, conceded, this, basil, indeed, viewed, slavery, as, a, result, of, the, fall, a, principle, that, was, shared, by, augustine, theodoret, and, many, other, fathers, sometimes, slavery, is, a, boon, to, the, enslaved, person, basil, maintained, in, moral, rules, 75, he, recommended, that, christian, slaves, work, harder, than, non, christian, slaves, this, view, is, opposed, to, gregory, of, nyssa, and, is, reminiscent, of, aristotle, s, argument, and, of, theodoret, s, it, is, in, the, ethical, manuals, and, moral, sermons, that, the, practical, aspects, of, his, theoretical, theology, are, illustrated, so, for, example, it, is, in, his, sermon, to, the, lazicans, that, we, find, basil, explaining, how, it, is, our, common, nature, that, obliges, us, to, treat, our, neighbor, s, natural, needs, e, g, hunger, thirst, as, our, own, even, though, he, is, a, separate, individual, basil, s, three, hundred, letters, reveal, his, character, they, show, his, observant, nature, which, despite, the, troubles, of, ill, health, and, ecclesiastical, unrest, remained, optimistic, tender, and, even, playful, basil, is, honoured, as, the, chief, architect, of, monastic, life, in, the, greek, church, most, of, his, extant, works, and, a, few, spuriously, attributed, to, him, are, available, in, the, patrologia, graeca, which, includes, latin, translations, of, varying, quality, several, of, basil, s, works, have, appeared, in, the, late, twentieth, century, in, the, sources, chr, tiennes, collection, a, famous, quote, of, basil, is, the, below, the, bread, you, store, belongs, to, the, hungry, the, clothes, you, accumulate, belong, to, the, naked, the, shoes, that, you, have, in, your, closet, are, for, the, barefoot, the, money, you, bury, deep, into, the, ground, to, keep, it, safe, belongs, to, the, poor, you, were, unfair, to, as, many, people, as, you, could, have, helped, and, you, did, not, basil, of, caesarea, holds, a, very, important, place, in, the, history, of, christian, liturgy, coming, as, he, did, at, the, end, of, the, age, of, persecution, that, st, basil, composed, a, liturgy, or, rather, reformed, an, existing, liturgy, is, beyond, doubt, since, besides, the, constant, tradition, of, the, byzantine, church, there, are, many, testimonies, in, ancient, writings, to, establish, the, fact, basil, s, liturgical, influence, is, well, attested, in, early, sources, most, of, the, liturgies, bearing, the, name, of, basil, are, not, entirely, his, work, in, their, present, form, but, they, nevertheless, preserve, a, recollection, of, basil, s, activity, in, this, field, in, formularizing, liturgical, prayers, and, promoting, church, song, patristics, scholars, conclude, that, the, liturgy, of, saint, basil, bears, unmistakably, the, personal, hand, pen, mind, and, heart, of, st, basil, the, great, one, liturgy, that, can, be, attributed, to, him, is, the, divine, liturgy, of, saint, basil, the, great, a, liturgy, that, is, somewhat, longer, than, the, more, commonly, used, divine, liturgy, of, st, john, chrysostom, the, difference, between, the, two, is, primarily, in, the, silent, prayers, said, by, the, priest, and, in, the, use, of, the, hymn, to, the, theotokos, all, of, creation, instead, of, the, axion, estin, of, john, chrysostom, s, liturgy, the, eastern, churches, preserve, numerous, other, prayers, attributed, to, basil, including, three, prayers, of, exorcism, several, morning, and, evening, prayers, and, the, prayer, of, the, hours, which, is, read, at, each, service, of, the, daily, office, through, his, examples, and, teachings, basil, effected, a, noteworthy, moderation, in, the, austere, practices, which, were, previously, characteristic, of, monastic, life, he, is, also, credited, with, coordinating, the, duties, of, work, and, prayer, to, ensure, a, proper, balance, between, the, two, basil, is, remembered, as, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, in, the, development, of, christian, monasticism, not, only, is, basil, recognized, as, the, father, of, eastern, monasticism, historians, recognize, that, his, legacy, extends, also, to, the, western, church, largely, due, to, his, influence, on, saint, benedict, patristic, scholars, such, as, meredith, assert, that, benedict, himself, recognized, this, when, he, wrote, in, the, epilogue, to, his, rule, that, his, monks, in, addition, to, the, bible, should, read, the, confessions, of, the, fathers, and, their, institutes, and, their, lives, and, the, rule, of, our, holy, father, basil, basil, s, teachings, on, monasticism, as, encoded, in, works, such, as, his, small, asketikon, was, transmitted, to, the, west, via, rufinus, during, the, late, 4th, century, as, a, result, of, basil, s, influence, numerous, religious, orders, in, eastern, christianity, bear, his, name, in, the, roman, catholic, church, the, basilian, fathers, also, known, as, the, congregation, of, st, basil, an, international, order, of, priests, and, students, studying, for, the, priesthood, is, named, after, him, basil, was, given, the, title, doctor, of, the, church, in, the, western, church, for, his, contributions, to, the, debate, initiated, by, the, arian, controversy, regarding, the, nature, of, the, trinity, and, especially, the, question, of, the, divinity, of, the, holy, spirit, basil, was, responsible, for, defining, the, terms, ousia, essence, substance, and, hypostasis, person, reality, and, for, defining, the, classic, formulation, of, three, persons, in, one, nature, his, single, greatest, contribution, was, his, insistence, on, the, divinity, and, consubstantiality, of, the, holy, spirit, with, the, father, and, the, son, in, greek, tradition, basil, brings, gifts, to, children, every, 1, january, st, basil, s, day, it, is, traditional, on, st, basil, s, day, to, serve, vasilopita, a, rich, bread, baked, with, a, coin, inside, the, tradition, is, attributed, to, st, basil, who, when, a, bishop, wanted, to, distribute, money, to, the, poor, and, commissioned, some, women, to, bake, sweetened, bread, in, which, he, arranged, to, place, gold, coins, thus, the, families, in, cutting, the, bread, were, pleasantly, surprised, to, find, the, coins, it, is, customary, on, his, feast, day, to, visit, the, homes, of, friends, and, relatives, to, sing, new, year, s, carols, and, to, set, an, extra, place, at, the, table, for, saint, basil, basil, being, born, into, a, wealthy, family, gave, away, all, his, possessions, to, the, poor, the, underprivileged, those, in, need, and, children, according, to, some, sources, basil, died, on, 1, january, and, the, eastern, orthodox, church, celebrates, his, feast, day, together, with, that, of, the, feast, of, the, circumcision, on, that, day, this, was, also, the, day, on, which, the, general, roman, calendar, celebrated, it, at, first, but, in, the, 13th, century, it, was, moved, to, 14, june, a, date, believed, to, be, that, of, his, ordination, as, bishop, and, it, remained, on, that, date, until, the, 1969, revision, of, the, calendar, which, moved, it, to, 2, january, rather, than, 1, january, because, the, latter, date, is, occupied, by, the, solemnity, of, mary, mother, of, god, on, 2, january, saint, basil, is, celebrated, together, with, saint, gregory, nazianzen, novus, ordo, services,
