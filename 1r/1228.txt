inscription, revealing, a, unique, practice, of, dealing, with, works, of, art, that, he, seems, to, have, developed, for, himself, on, certain, fixed, occasions, over, a, long, period, he, contemplated, a, number, of, paintings, or, works, of, calligraphy, which, possessed, special, meaning, for, him, inscribing, each, regularly, with, mostly, private, notes, on, the, circumstances, of,

commitment, he, learned, to, read, tibetan, and, studied, buddhist, texts, assiduously, his, beliefs, are, reflected, in, the, tibetan, buddhist, imagery, of, his, tomb, perhaps, the, most, personal, and, private, expression, of, an, emperor, s, life, he, supported, the, yellow, church, the, tibetan, buddhist, gelug, sect, to, maintain, peace, among, the, mongols, since, the, mongols, were, followers, of, the, dalai, lama, and, panchen, lama, of, the, yellow, church, he, also, said, it, was, merely, in, pursuance, of, our, policy, of, extending, our, affection, to, the, weak, which, led, him, to, patronize, the, yellow, church, in, 1744, he, turned, the, palace, of, harmony, yonghe, palace, into, a, tibetan, buddhist, temple, for, mongols, to, explain, the, practical, reasons, for, supporting, the, yellow, hats, tibetan, buddhists, and, to, deflect, han, chinese, criticism, he, had, the, lama, shuo, stele, engraved, in, tibetan, mongol, manchu, and, chinese, which, said, by, patronizing, the, yellow, church, we, maintain, peace, among, the, mongols, this, being, an, important, task, we, cannot, but, protect, this, religion, in, doing, so, we, do, not, show, any, bias, nor, do, we, wish, to, adulate, the, tibetan, priests, as, it, was, done, during, the, yuan, dynasty, mark, elliott, concludes, that, these, actions, delivered, political, benefits, but, meshed, seamlessly, with, his, personal, faith, qing, policy, on, muslims, and, islam, was, changed, during, the, reign, of, the, kangxi, yongzheng, and, qianlong, emperors, while, the, kangxi, emperor, proclaimed, muslims, and, han, to, be, equal, his, grandson, the, qianlong, emperor, endorsed, han, officials, harsh, recommendations, towards, treatment, of, muslims, the, kangxi, emperor, said, that, muslim, and, han, chinese, were, equal, when, people, argued, for, muslims, to, be, treated, differently, the, yongzheng, emperor, held, the, opinion, that, islam, was, foolish, but, he, felt, it, did, not, pose, a, threat, when, a, judge, in, shandong, petitioned, him, to, destroy, mosques, and, ban, islam, yongzheng, then, fired, an, official, for, demanding, muslims, be, punished, more, harshly, than, non, muslims, this, policy, changed, in, the, reign, of, the, qianlong, emperor, chen, hongmou, a, qing, official, said, that, muslims, needed, to, be, brought, to, law, and, order, by, being, punished, more, harshly, and, blaming, muslim, leaders, for, criminal, behavior, of, muslims, in, a, letter, to, the, board, of, punishments, called, covenant, to, instruct, and, admonish, muslims, that, he, wrote, in, 1751, although, the, board, of, punishment, did, nothing, the, shaanxi, gansu, governor, general, in, 1762, then, proceeded, to, implement, his, recommendation, and, had, muslim, criminals, punished, severely, more, than, han, chinese, ones, he, also, implemented, the, policy, that, the, criminal, deeds, of, muslim, congregants, of, mosques, ended, up, with, their, imams, being, punished, and, held, responsible, for, them, these, anti, muslim, policies, by, the, governor, general, received, endorsement, from, the, qianlong, emperor, great, changes, happening, to, chinese, muslims, like, the, introduction, of, a, sufi, order, the, naqshbandiyya, to, the, hui, causing, the, qianlong, emperor, to, adopt, this, harsh, attitude, against, muslims, in, contrast, to, his, grandfather, and, father, this, led, to, larger, connections, between, the, hui, and, the, broader, islamic, world, from, the, west, as, the, naqshbandiyya, order, came, east, to, the, hui, when, hui, scholars, in, suzhou, were, converted, to, naqshbandiyya, by, muhammad, yusuf, khoja, afaq, khoja, muhammad, yusuf, s, son, also, further, spread, naqshbandi, orders, among, chinese, muslims, like, tibetan, muslims, salars, hui, and, other, muslim, ethnicities, in, hezhou, gansu, now, linxia, and, xining, in, qinghai, and, lanzhou, ma, laichi, was, the, leader, of, one, of, these, orders, and, he, personally, studied, in, the, islamic, world, in, bukhara, to, learn, sufism, and, yemen, and, in, mecca, where, he, was, taught, by, mawlana, makhdum, this, brought, him, prestige, among, chinese, muslims, in, an, argument, over, the, breaking, of, fast, during, ramadan, ma, laichi, said, that, before, praying, in, the, mosque, fast, should, be, broken, not, vice, versa, and, this, led, to, him, getting, many, naqshbandi, converts, from, hui, and, turkic, salars, it, came, to, court, in, 1731, when, the, muslims, arguing, over, how, to, break, ramadan, fast, filed, lawsuits, the, muslim, plaintiffs, were, told, by, the, qing, authorities, at, the, court, to, resolve, them, themselves, as, the, legal, authorities, who, had, no, idea, about, ramadan, fasting, the, dispute, was, not, solved, and, continued, to, go, on, and, was, compounded, by, even, more, disputes, like, how, to, perform, dhikr, in, sufism, in, a, jahri, vocal, as, taught, by, ma, mingxin, another, sufi, who, learned, in, the, western, islamic, lands, like, bukhara, or, khufi, silent, like, what, ma, laichi, did, the, zabid, naqshbandiyyas, in, yemen, taught, ma, mingxin, for, two, decades, they, taught, vocal, dhikr, ma, mingxin, was, also, affected, by, another, series, of, events, in, the, middle, eastern, muslim, world, revivalist, movements, among, muslims, like, the, saudis, who, allied, with, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, this, renewal, tajdid, influenced, ma, mingxin, in, yemen, while, ma, mingxin, was, in, yemen, and, away, from, china, all, of, muslim, inner, asia, was, conquered, by, the, infidel, qing, dynasty, giving, even, more, relevance, to, his, situation, and, views, ma, laichi, and, ma, mingxin, again, sued, each, other, in, court, but, this, second, time, the, qing, passed, a, verdict, in, favor, of, the, quiet, dhikr, faction, the, silentist, khafiyya, of, ma, laichi, and, gave, it, the, status, of, orthodoxy, while, damning, as, heterodox, the, aloudist, jahriyya, of, ma, mingxin, ma, mingxin, ignored, the, order, and, kept, proselytizing, in, shaanxi, ningxia, and, xinjiang, going, to, guangchuan, from, hezhou, in, 1769, after, being, kicked, out, and, banned, from, xunhua, district, turkic, salars, in, xunhua, followed, his, orders, even, after, the, qing, banned, him, from, there, and, he, continued, to, have, further, lawsuits, and, legal, issues, with, the, khafiyya, and, ma, laichi, as, the, qing, backed, the, khafiyya, a, violent, battle, where, a, qing, official, and, khafiyya, followers, were, among, one, hundred, slaughtered, by, a, jahriyya, assault, headed, by, su, forty, three, a, supporter, of, ma, mingxin, in, 1781, led, to, ma, mingxin, declared, a, rebel, and, taken, to, jail, in, lanzhou, the, qing, executed, ma, mingxin, after, his, release, was, demanded, by, the, armed, followers, of, su, forty, three, a, jahriyya, rebellion, all, over, northwest, china, ensued, after, ma, mingxin, was, executed, in, response, the, manchus, in, beijing, sent, manchu, grand, secretary, agui, with, a, battalion, to, slaughter, jahriyya, chiefs, and, exile, the, adherents, of, the, sufi, order, to, the, border, regions, tian, wu, led, another, jahriyya, rebellion, 3, years, after, that, which, was, crushed, by, the, qing, and, the, ma, datian, the, jahriyya, s, 3rd, leader, was, exiled, to, manchuria, in, 1818, by, the, qing, and, died, this, continual, build, up, of, conflict, between, muslims, and, the, qing, court, led, to, the, 19th, century, full, scale, wars, with, muslim, rebellions, against, the, qing, in, southern, and, northern, china, the, change, in, manchu, attitudes, towards, muslims, from, tolerating, muslims, and, regarding, them, as, equal, to, han, chinese, before, the, 1760s, to, the, violence, between, the, qing, state, and, muslims, after, the, 1760s, was, due, to, progressive, qing, involvement, in, the, conflict, between, the, sufi, orders, jahriyya, and, khafiyya, making, it, no, longer, possible, for, the, qing, to, keep, up, with, the, early, rhetoric, of, muslim, equality, the, manchu, court, under, qianlong, began, approving, and, implementing, chen, hongmou, s, anti, muslim, laws, that, targeted, muslims, for, practicing, their, religion, and, the, violence, by, the, qing, state, the, communal, violence, between, jahriyya, and, khafiyya, coincided, with, the, jahriyya, s, major, expansion, chen, hongmou, s, policies, were, implemented, as, laws, in, 1762, by, the, qing, government, s, board, of, punishments, and, the, qing, manchu, qianlong, emperor, leading, to, severe, tensions, with, muslims, state, authorities, were, mandated, to, receive, all, reports, of, muslim, criminal, behaviour, by, local, officials, and, all, criminal, behaviour, by, muslims, had, to, be, reported, by, muslim, leaders, to, qing, authorities, under, these, laws, this, led, to, an, inundation, of, anti, muslim, reports, filing, in, qing, offices, as, the, qing, court, received, information, that, muslims, were, inherently, violent, and, muslim, bandits, were, committing, crimes, as, report, after, report, were, filed, by, local, officials, and, muslim, crimes, inundated, court, records, the, qing, became, even, more, anti, muslim, after, receiving, these, reports, about, criminal, behavior, and, started, passing, even, more, anti, muslim, laws, one, of, them, being, that, if, any, weapon, was, found, in, a, group, of, 3, or, more, muslims, all, of, those, muslims, would, by, sentenced, as, criminals, by, the, qing, a, new, criminal, category, or, act, brawling, dou, ou, was, designated, by, the, qing, manchu, court, of, the, manchu, qianlong, emperor, in, the, 1770s, especially, as, an, anti, muslim, measure, to, arrest, muslims, leading, to, even, non, jahriyya, muslims, to, join, with, jahriyya, against, the, qing, and, leading, the, qing, court, to, be, even, more, anti, muslim, apprehensive, of, anti, qing, rebellion, by, muslims, this, led, to, the, execution, of, ma, mingxin, in, 1781, and, the, rebellion, and, violence, was, compounded, by, lack, of, qing, intelligence, a, qing, official, who, was, tasked, with, ending, the, jahriyya, and, khafiyya, communal, violence, mistakenly, thought, the, people, he, were, talking, to, were, khafiyya, when, they, were, in, fact, jahriyya, and, he, told, them, that, the, qing, would, massacre, all, jahriyya, adherents, this, led, to, him, being, murdered, by, the, jahriyya, mob, which, led, to, the, qing, sending, manchu, grand, secretary, agui, on, a, full, scale, pacification, crackdown, campaign, against, the, jahriyya, the, military, victory, of, the, qing, against, the, jahriyya, led, to, even, more, jahriyya, anger, officials, went, overboard, in, massacring, muslims, deemed, as, state, enemies, to, impress, the, qing, court, leading, to, further, growth, in, jahriyya, membership, leading, in, turn, to, the, 1784, rebellion, by, tian, wu, the, qianlong, emperor, asked, his, minister, what, was, going, on, as, he, was, puzzled, as, to, how, the, muslims, from, many, regions, gathered, together, for, revolt, he, asked, if, the, investigation, of, muslim, behavior, by, li, shiyao, got, leaked, leading, to, rebels, to, incite, violence, by, telling, muslims, the, government, would, exterminate, them, he, then, pondered, and, said, none, of, these, could, be, why, and, kept, asking, why, to, solve, the, issue, of, the, 1784, revolt, northwestern, china, was, put, under, military, occupation, by, the, qing, for, 50, years, until, the, taiping, rebellion, of, southern, china, forced, the, qing, to, move, them, away, from, northwest, china, leading, to, the, massive, 1860s, and, 1870s, muslim, revolts, in, the, northwest, caused, by, growing, violence, the, sudden, questions, about, halal, in, islam, that, mongol, buddhists, had, in, the, 18th, century, was, caused, by, all, these, things, northwestern, china, right, next, to, mongolia, getting, militarized, the, qing, government, officially, declaring, muslims, to, be, anti, qing, and, violent, and, revivalist, islam, coming, to, china, more, than, 1000, hui,

identified, china, and, the, qing, empire, as, the, same, and, in, treaties, and, diplomatic, papers, the, qing, empire, called, itself, china, the, qianlong, emperor, rejected, earlier, ideas, that, only, han, could, be, subjects, of, china, and, only, han, land, could, be, considered, as, part, of, china, so, he, redefined, china, as, multiethnic, saying, in, 1755, that, there, exists, a, view, of, china, according, to, which, non, han, people, cannot, become, china, s, subjects, and, their, land, cannot, be, integrated, into, the, territory, of, china, this, does, not, represent, our, dynasty, s, understanding, of, china, but, is, instead, that, of, the, earlier, han, tang, song, and, ming, dynasties, the, qianlong, emperor, rejected, the, views, of, han, officials, who, said, xinjiang, was, not, part, of, china, and, that, he, should, not, conquer, it, putting, forth, the, view, that, china, was, multiethnic, and, did, not, just, refer, to, han, the, qianlong, emperor,

of, hectares, in, inner, mongolia, by, the, 1780s, the, qianlong, emperor, allowed, han, peasants, suffering, from, drought, to, move, into, manchuria, despite, him, issuing, edicts, in, favor, of,

complacent, in, his, reign, and, started, placing, his, trust, in, corrupt, officials, such, as, yu, minzhong, and, heshen, as, heshen, was, the, highest, ranked, minister, and, most, favoured, by, the, qianlong, emperor, at, the, time, the, day, to, day, governance, of, the, country, was, left, in, his, hands, while, the, emperor, himself, indulged, in, the, arts, luxuries, and, literature, when, heshen, was, executed, by, the, jiaqing, emperor, the, qing, government, discovered, that, heshen, s, personal, fortune, exceeded, that, of, the, qing, empire, s, depleted, treasury, amounting, to, 900, million, silver, taels, the, total, of, 12, years, of, treasury, surplus, of, the, qing, imperial, court, the, qianlong, emperor, began, his, reign, with, about, 33, 95, million, silver, taels, in, treasury, surplus, at, the, peak, of, his, reign, c, 1775, even, with, further, tax, cuts, the, treasury, surplus, still, reached, 73, 9, million, silver, taels, a, record, unmatched, by, his, predecessors, the, kangxi, and, yongzheng, emperors, both, of, whom, had, implemented, remarkable, tax, cut, policies, however, due, to, numerous, factors, such, as, long, term, embezzlement, and, corruption, by, officials, frequent, expeditions, to, the, south, huge, palace, constructions, many, war, and, rebellion, campaigns, as, well, as, his, own, extravagant, lifestyle, all, of, these, cost, the, treasury, a, total, of, 150, 2, million, silver, taels, this, coupled, with, his, senior, age, and, the, lack, of, political, reforms, ushered, the, beginning, of, the, gradual, decline, and, eventual, demise, of, the, qing, empire, casting, a, shadow, over, his, political, life, legal, trade, in, the, south, china, sea, was, resumed, in, 1727, but, the, east, india, company, s, discovery, that, the, prices, and, duties, at, ningbo, were, both, much, lower, than, those, at, guangzhou, prompted, them, to, begin, shifting, their, trade, north, from, 1755, to, 1757, the, qianlong, emperor, s, attempt, to, discourage, this, through, higher, fees, failed, in, the, winter, of, 1757, he, declared, that, effective, the, next, year, guangzhou, then, romanized, as, canton, was, to, be, the, only, chinese, port, permitted, to, foreign, traders, beginning, the, canton, system, with, its, cohong, and, thirteen, factories, during, the, mid, 18th, century, european, powers, began, to, pressure, for, increases, in, the, already, burgeoning, foreign, trade, and, for, outposts, on, the, chinese, coast, demands, which, the, aging, qianlong, emperor, resisted, in, 1793, king, george, iii, sent, a, large, scale, delegation, to, present, their, requests, directly, to, the, emperor, in, beijing, headed, by, george, macartney, one, of, the, country, s, most, seasoned, diplomats, the, british, sent, a, sample, of, trade, goods, that, they, intended, to, sell, in, china, this, was, misinterpreted, as, tribute, that, was, adjudged, to, be, of, low, quality, historians, both, in, china, and, abroad, long, presented, the, failure, of, the, mission, to, achieve, its, goals, as, a, symbol, of, china, s, refusal, to, change, and, inability, to, modernize, they, explain, the, refusal, first, on, the, fact, that, interaction, with, foreign, kingdoms, was, limited, to, neighbouring, tributary, states, furthermore, the, worldviews, on, the, two, sides, were, incompatible, china, holding, entrenched, beliefs, that, china, was, the, central, kingdom, however, after, the, publication, in, the, 1990s, of, a, fuller, range, of, archival, documents, concerning, the, visit, these, claims, have, been, challenged, one, historian, characterized, the, emperor, and, his, court, as, clearly, clever, and, competent, political, operators, and, concluded, that, they, acted, within, the, formal, qing, claims, to, universal, rule, they, reacted, prudently, to, reports, of, british, expansion, in, india, by, placating, the, british, with, unspecified, promises, in, order, to, avoid, military, conflicts, and, loss, of, trade, macartney, was, granted, an, audience, with, the, qianlong, emperor, on, two, days, the, second, of, which, coincided, with, the, emperor, s, 82nd, birthday, there, is, continued, debate, about, the, nature, of, the, audience, and, what, level, of, ceremonials, were, performed, macartney, wrote, that, he, resisted, demands, that, the, british, trade, ambassadors, kneel, and, perform, the, kowtow, and, debate, continues, as, to, what, exactly, occurred, differing, opinions, recorded, by, qing, courtiers, and, british, delegates, qianlong, gave, macartney, a, letter, for, the, british, king, stating, the, reasons, that, he, would, not, grant, macartney, s, requests, yesterday, your, ambassador, petitioned, my, ministers, to, memorialise, me, regarding, your, trade, with, china, but, his, proposal, is, not, consistent, with, our, dynastic, usage, and, cannot, be, entertained, hitherto, all, european, nations, including, your, own, country, s, barbarian, merchants, have, carried, on, their, trade, with, our, celestial, empire, at, canton, such, has, been, the, procedure, for, many, years, although, our, celestial, empire, possesses, all, things, in, prolific, abundance, and, lacks, no, product, within, its, own, borders, your, request, for, a, small, island, near, chusan, where, your, merchants, may, reside, and, goods, be, warehoused, arises, from, your, desire, to, develop, trade, consider, moreover, that, england, is, not, the, only, barbarian, land, which, wishes, to, establish, trade, with, our, empire, supposing, that, other, nations, were, all, to, imitate, your, evil, example, and, beseech, me, to, present, them, each, and, all, with, a, site, for, trading, purposes, how, could, i, possibly, comply, this, also, is, a, flagrant, infringement, of, the, usage, of, my, empire, and, cannot, possibly, be, entertained, hitherto, the, barbarian, merchants, of, europe, have, had, a, definite, locality, assigned, to, them, at, aomen, for, residence, and, trade, and, have, been, forbidden, to, encroach, an, inch, beyond, the, limits, assigned, to, that, locality, if, these, restrictions, were, withdrawn, friction, would, inevitably, occur, between, the, chinese, and, your, barbarian, subjects, regarding, your, nation, s, worship, of, the, lord, of, heaven, it, is, the,
