and, clearly, recognizable, he, used, planes, of, colour, and, small, brushstrokes, that, build, up, to, form, complex, fields, the, paintings, convey, c, zanne, s, intense, study, of, his, subjects, his, painting, initially, provoked, incomprehension, and, ridicule, in, contemporary, art, criticism, until, the, late, 1890s, it, was, mainly, fellow, artists, such, as, camille, pissarro, and, the,

resulting, in, a, large, inheritance, his, mother, anne, elisabeth, honorine, aubert, 1814, 1897, was, vivacious, and, romantic, but, quick, to, take, offence, it, was, from, her, that, c, zanne, got,

paris, in, 1861, he, was, strongly, encouraged, to, make, this, decision, by, zola, who, was, already, living, in, the, capital, at, the, time, and, urged, c, zanne, to, abandon, his, hesitancy, and, follow, him, there, eventually, his, father, reconciled, with, c, zanne, and, supported, his, choice, of, career, on, condition, that, he, begin, a, regular, course, of, study, having, given, up, hope, of, finding, paul, as, his, successor, in, the, banking, business, c, zanne, later, received, an, inheritance, of, 400, 000, francs, from, his, father, which, rid, him, of, all, financial, worries, c, zanne, moved, to, paris, in, april, 1861, the, high, hopes, he, had, set, in, paris, were, not, fulfilled, as, he, had, applied, to, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, and, was, turned, down,

his, hometown, of, aix, he, often, copied, at, the, louvre, from, works, by, old, masters, such, as, michelangelo, rubens, and, titian, but, the, city, remained, alien, to, him, and, he, soon, thought, of, returning, to, aix, en, provence, initially, the, friendship, formed, in, the, mid, 1860s, between, pissarro, and, c, zanne, was, that, of, master, and, disciple, in, which, pissarro, exerted, a, formative, influence, on, the, younger, artist, over, the, course, of, the, following, decade, their, landscape, painting, excursions, together, in, louveciennes, and, pontoise, led, to, a, collaborative, working, relationship, between, equals, zola, s, faith, in, c, zanne, s, future, was, shaken, in, june, he, wrote, to, their, childhood, friend, baille, paul, is, still, the, excellent, and, strange, fellow, i, knew, at, school, to, prove, that, he, hasn, t, lost, any, of, his, originality, i, have, only, to, tell, you, that, as, soon, as, he, got, here, he, talked, about, returning, c, zanne, painted, a, portrait, of, zola, that, zola, had, asked, for, to, encourage, his, friend, but, c, zanne, was, unsatisfied, with, the, result, and, destroyed, the, picture, in,

sisley, in, contrast, to, the, official, artistic, life, of, france, c, zanne, was, under, the, influence, of, gustave, courbet, and, eug, ne, delacroix, who, strove, for, a, renewal, of, art, and, demanded, the, depiction, of, unembellished, reality, courbet, s, followers, called, themselves, realists, and, followed, his, principle, il, faut, encanailler, l, art, one, must, throw, art, into, the, gutter, formulated, as, early, as, 1849, which, means, that, art, must, be, brought, down, from, its, ideal, height, and, become, a, matter, of, everyday, life, douard, manet, made, the, definitive, break, with, historical, painting, concerned, not, with, analytical, observation, but, with, the, reproduction, of, his, subjective, perception, and, the, liberation, of, the, pictorial, object, from, symbolic, burdens, the, exclusion, of, the, works, of, manet, pissarro, and, monet, from, the, official, salon, the, salon, de, paris, in, 1863, provoked, such, outrage, among, artists,

noticed, unusual, patterns, in, the, cracking, and, on, a, hunch, had, it, x, rayed, because, c, zanne, dated, few, paintings, it, is, believed, to, be, the, earliest, firmly, dated, portrait, by, the, artist, museum, curators, believe, it, is, likely, a, self, portrait, if, so, it, may, also, be, one, of, the, earliest, depictions, of, the, artist, who, was, in, his, 20s, the, year, he, painted, the, still, life, in, the, summer, of, 1865, c, zanne, returned, to, aix, zola, s, debut, novel, la, confession, de, claude, was, published, it, was, dedicated, to, his, childhood, friends,

january, 1872, c, zanne, s, mother, was, kept, a, party, to, family, events, but, his, father, was, not, informed, of, hortense, for, fear, of, risking, his, wrath, and, so, as, not, to, lose, the, financial, allowances, that, his, father, gave, him, to, live, as, an, artist, the, artist, received, from, his, father, a, monthly, allowance, of, 100, francs, when, c, zanne, s, friend, the, crippled, painter, achille, emperaire, sought, refuge, with, the, family, in, paris, in, 1872, due, to, financial, hardship, he, soon, left, his, friend, however, it, was, necessary, otherwise, i,

pissarro, to, work, in, pontoise, in, the, oise, valley, pissarro, as, a, sensitive, artist, became, a, mentor, to, the, shy, irritable, c, zanne, whome, he, was, able, to, persuade, to, turn, away, from, the, darker, colours, and, gave, him, advice, to, always, only, paint, with, the, three, primary, colours, red, yellow, blue, and, their, immediate, deviations, and, refrain, from, linear, contouring, defining, shapes, from, the, gradation, of, the, colour, tonal, values, c, zanne, felt, that, the, impressionist, technique, was, bringing, him, closer, to, his, goal, and, heeded, his, friend, s, advice, pissarro, later, reported, we, were, always, together, but, still, each, of, us, kept, what, counts, alone, our, own, feelings, the, young, painters, in, paris, did, not, see, any, support, for, their, works, in, the, salon, de, paris, and, therefore, took, up, claude, monet, s, plan, for, their, own, exhibition, which, had, been, made, in, 1867, from, 15, april, to, 15, may, 1874, the, first, group, exhibition, of, the, soci, t, anonyme, des, artistes, peintres, sculpteurs, engravers, later, known, as, the, impressionists, took, place, this, name, derives, from, the,

thus, created, the, term, for, this, new, art, movement, the, place, of, exhibition, was, the, studio, of, the, photographer, nadar, on, boulevard, des, capucines, pissarro, pushed, through, c, zanne, s, participation, despite, concerns, from, some, members, who, feared, c, zanne, s, bold, paintings, would, harm, the, exhibition, c, zanne, was, influenced, by, their, style, but, his, social, relations, with, them, were, inept, he, seemed, rude, shy, angry, and, given, to, depression, in, addition, to, c, zanne, renoir, monet, alfred, sisley, berthe, morisot, edgar, degas, and, pissarro, among, others, exhibited, manet, declined, participation, for, him, c, zanne, was, a, mason, who, paints, with, a, trowel, c, zanne, in, particular, caused, a, sensation, arousing, indignation, and, derision, from, the, critics, with, his, paintings, such, as, the, landscape, near, auvers, and, the, modern, olympia, in, a, modern, olympia, created, as, a, quote, from, manet, s, 1863, painting, olympia, which, was, often, reviled, c, zanne, sought, an, even, more, drastic, depiction, and, in, addition, to, the, prostitute, and, servant, also, showed, the, suitor, whose, figure, is, believed, to, be, a, self, portrait, the, exhibition, proved, a, financial, failure, the, final, accounts, showed, a, deficit, of, over, 180, francs, for, each, of, the, participating, artists, c, zanne, s, the, hanged, man, s, house, was, one, of, the, few, pictures, that, could, be, sold, the, collector, count, doria, bought, it, for, 300, francs, in, 1875, c, zanne, met, the, customs, inspector, and, art, collector, victor, chocquet, who, mediated, by, renoir, bought, three, of, his, works, and, became, his, most, loyal, collector, and, whose, commissions, provided, some, financial, relief, c, zanne, did, not, take, part, in, the, group, s, second, exhibition, but, instead, presented, 16, of, his, works, in, the, third, exhibition, in, 1877, which, in, turn, drew, considerable, criticism, reviewer, louis, leroy, said, of, c, zanne, s, portrait, of, chocquet, this, peculiar, looking, head, the, colour, of, an, old, boot, might, give, a, shock, and, cause, yellow, fever, in, the, fruit, of, her, womb, before, its, entry, into, the, world, it, was, the, last, time, he, exhibited, with, the, impressionists, another, patron, was, the, paint, merchant, julien, p, re, tanguy, who, supported, the, young, painters, by, supplying, them, with, paint, and, canvas, in, exchange, for, paintings, in, march, 1878, c, zanne, s, father, found, out, about, the, long, hidden, relationship, with, hortense, and, their, illegitimate, son, paul, through, a, thoughtless, letter, by, victor, chocquet, he, then, cut, the, monthly, bill, in, half, and, c, zanne, entered, a, financially, tense, period, in, which, he, had, to, ask, zola, for, help, but, in, september, he, relented, and, decided, to, give, him, 400, francs, for, his, family, c, zanne, continued, to, migrate, between, the, paris, region, and, provence, until, louis, auguste, had, a, studio, built, for, him, at, his, home, bastide, du, jas, de, bouffan, in, the, early, 1880s, this, was, on, the, upper, floor, and, an, enlarged, window, was, provided, allowing, in, the, northern, light, but, interrupting, the, line, of, the, eaves, this, feature, remains, c, zanne, stabilized, his, residence, in, l, estaque, he, painted, with, renoir, there, in, 1882, and, visited, renoir, and, monet, in, 1883, in, 1881, c, zanne, worked, in, pontoise, with, paul, gauguin, and, pissarro, c, zanne, returned, to, aix, at, the, end, of, the, year, he, later, accused, gauguin, of, having, stolen, his, little, sensation, from, him, and, that, gauguin, on, the, other, hand, only, painted, chinoiseries, in, the, spring, of, 1882, c, zanne, worked, with, renoir, in, aix, and, for, the, first, time, in, l, estaque, a, small, fishing, village, near, marseille, which, he, also, visited, in, 1883, and, 1888, one, of, the, first, two, stays, was, the, bay, of, marseille, seen, from, l, estaque, during, the, autumn, of, 1885, and, the, months, that, followed, c, zanne, stayed, in, gardanne, a, small, hilltop, town, near, aix, en, provence, where, he, produced, several, paintings, whose, faceted, forms, were, already, anticipating, the, cubist, style, c, zanne, s, long, friendly, relationship, with, mile, zola, had, by, now, become, more, distant, in, 1878, the, urbane, successful, writer, had, set, up, a, luxurious, summer, house, in, m, dan, near, auvers, where, c, zanne, had, visited, him, repeatedly, in, the, years, 1879, to, 1882, and, in, 1885, but, his, friend, s, lavish, lifestyle, made, c, zanne, who, lived, an, unassuming, life, aware, of, his, own, inadequacy, and, caused, him, to, doubt, himself, zola, who, meanwhile, regarded, the, childhood, friend, as, a, failure, published, his, roman, clef, l, uvre, from, the, novel, cycle, of, rougon, macquart, in, march, 1886, whose, protagonist, the, painter, claude, lantier, did, not, achieve, the, realization, of, his, goals, and, committed, suicide, in, order, to, further, emphasize, the, parallels, between, fiction, and, biography, zola, placed, the, successful, writer, sandoz, alongside, the, painter, lantier, in, his, work, monet, and, edmond, de, goncourt, tended, to, see, douard, manet, in, the, fictional, painter, described, but, c, zanne, found, himself, reflected, in, many, details, he, formally, thanked, him, for, sending, the, work, supposedly, related, to, him, for, a, long, time, it, was, thought, that, contact, between, the, two, childhood, friends, then, broke, off, forever, recently, letters, have, been, discovered, that, refute, this, a, letter, from, 1887, demonstrates, that, their, friendship, did, endure, for, at, least, some, time, after, on, 28, april, 1886, paul, c, zanne, and, hortense, fiquet, were, married, in, aix, in, the, presence, of, his, parents, the, connection, to, hortense, was, not, legalized, out, of, love, as, their, relationship, had, long, since, broken, down, c, zanne, was, shy, of, women, and, terrified, of, being, touched, a, trauma, that, stemmed, from, his, childhood, when, by, his, own, admission, a, classmate, had, kicked, him, from, behind, on, the, stairs, rather, the, marriage, was, intended, to, secure, the, rights, of, the, now, fourteen, year, old, son, paul, whom, c, zanne, loved, very, much, as, a, legitimate, son, in, the, early, 1880s, the, c, zanne, family, stabilized, their, residence, in, provence, where, they, remained, except, for, brief, sojourns, abroad, from, then, on, the, move, reflects, a, new, independence, from, the, paris, centered, impressionists, and, a, marked, preference, for, the, south, c, zanne, s, native, soil, hortense, s, brother, had, a, house, within, view, of, montagne, sainte, victoire, at, l, estaque, a, run, of, paintings, of, this, mountain, from, 1880, to, 1883, and, others, of, gardanne, from, 1885, to, 1888, are, sometimes, known, as, the, constructive, period, despite, the, strained, relationship, hortense, was, the, person, who, was, most, often, portrayed, by, c, zanne, from, the, early, 1870s, to, the, early, 1890s, 26, paintings, of, hortense, are, known, she, endured, the, strenuous, sessions, motionless, and, patiently, in, october, 1886, after, the, death, of, his, father, c, zanne, his, mother, and, sisters, inherited, his, estate, which, included, the, jas, de, bouffan, estate, so, that, c, zanne, s, financial, situation, became, much, easier, my, father, was, a, brilliant, man, he, said, in, retrospect, he, left, me, an, income, of, 25, 000, francs, by, 1888, the, family, was, in, the, former, manor, jas, de, bouffan, a, substantial, house, and, grounds, with, outbuildings, which, afforded, a, new, found, comfort, as, of, 2001, this, house, with, much, reduced, grounds, is, now, owned, by, the, city, and, was, open, to, the, public, on, a, restricted, basis, c, zanne, lived, in, paris, and, increasingly, in, aix, without, his, family, renoir, visited, him, there, in, january, 1888, and, they, worked, together, in, jas, de, bouffan, s, studio, in, 1890, c, zanne, developed, diabetes, the, illness, made, it, even, more, difficult, for, him, to, deal, with, his, fellow, human, beings, c, zanne, spent, a, few, months, in, switzerland, with, her, and, his, son, paul, in, the, hope, that, the, troubled, relationship, with, hortense, could, be, stabilized, the, attempt, failed, so, he, returned, to, provence, with, hortense, and, paul, fils, going, to, paris, financial, need, prompted, hortense, s, return, to, provence, but, in, separate, living, quarters, c, zanne, moved, in, with, his, mother, and, sister, in, 1891, he, turned, to, catholicism, in, the, same, year, he, exhibited, three, of, his, works, at, the, group, les, xx, in, brussels, the, soci, t, des, vingt, short, les, xx, or, les, vingt, was, an, association, founded, around, 1883, by, belgian, artists, or, artists, living, in, belgium, including, fernand, khnopff, th, o, van, rysselberghe, james, ensor, and, the, siblings, anna, and, eug, ne, boch, in, may, 1895, he, attended, monet, s, exhibition, at, the, durand, ruel, gallery, with, pissarro, he, was, enthusiastic, but, later, significantly, identified, 1868, as, monet, s, strongest, period, when, he, was, even, more, influenced, by, courbet, with, his, fellow, student, from, the, acad, mie, suisse, achille, emperaire, c, zanne, went, to, the, area, around, the, village, of, le, tholonet, where, he, lived, in, the, ch, teau, noir, which, is, located, on, the, montagne, sainte, victoire, he, often, took, the, mountains, as, a, theme, in, his, paintings, he, rented, a, hut, at, the, nearby, bib, mus, quarry, bib, mus, became, another, motif, for, his, paintings, ambroise, vollard, an, aspiring, gallery, owner, opened, c, zanne, s, first, one, man, show, in, november, 1895, in, his, gallery, he, showed, a, selection, of, 50, of, around, 150, works, that, c, zanne, had, sent, him, as, a, package, vollard, met, degas, and, renoir, in, 1894, when, he, was, exhibiting, a, bundle, of, manet, in, his, small, shop, and, they, exchanged, manet, works, for, their, own, works, with, him, vollard, also, established, relationships, with, pierre, bonnard, and, douard, vuillard, and, in, the, same, year, the, well, known, paint, dealer, p, re, tanguy, when, tanguy, died, vollard, was, able, to, buy, works, by, three, artists, who, were, still, unknown, at, the, time, c, zanne, gauguin, and, van, gogh, the, first, buyer, of, a, c, zanne, painting, was, monet, followed, by, colleagues, like, degas, renoir, pissarro, and, later, art, collectors, prices, for, works, by, c, zanne, rose, a, hundredfold, and, vollard, as, always, profited, from, his, stocks, in, 1897, a, c, zanne, painting, was, purchased, by, a, museum, for, the, first, time, hugo, von, tschudi, acquired, c, zanne, s, landscape, painting, the, mill, on, the, couleuvre, near, pontoise, in, the, durand, ruel, gallery, for, the, berlin, national, gallery, c, zanne, s, mother, died, on, 25, october, 1897, in, november, 1899, at, the, insistence, of, his, sister, he, sold, the, now, practically, deserted, property, jas, de, bouffan, and, moved, into, a, small, city, apartment, at, 23, rue, boulegon, in, aix, en, provence, the, planned, purchase, of, the, ch, teau, noir, property, could, not, be, realized, he, hired, a, housekeeper, mme, bremond, to, look, after, him, until, his, death, the, art, market, meanwhile, continued, to, react, positively, to, c, zanne, s, works, pissarro, wrote, from, paris, in, june, 1899, about, the, auction, of, the, chocquet, collection, from, his, estate, these, include, thirty, two, c, zannes, of, the, first, rank, the, c, zannes, will, fetch, very, high, prices, and, are, already, estimated, at, four, to, five, thousand, francs, in, this, auction, market, prices, for, c, zanne, paintings, were, achieved, for, the, first, time, but, they, were, still, far, below, those, for, paintings, by, manet, monet, or, renoir, in, 1901, maurice, denis, exhibited,

road, on, some, high, ground, where, he, had, his, studio, built, on, the, chemin, des, lauves, in, 1902, according, to, his, needs, atelier, de, c, zanne, now, open, to, the, public, he, moved, there, in, 1903, for, large, format, paintings, such, as, the, bathers, which, he, created, in, the, les, lauves, studio, he, had, a, long, narrow, gap, in, the, wall, built, through, which, natural, light, could, flow, that, year, zola, died, leaving, c, zanne, in, mourning, despite, the, estrangement, his, health, deteriorated, with, age, in, addition, to, his, diabetes, he, suffered, from, depression, which, manifested, itself, in, growing, distrust, of, his, fellow, human, beings, to, the, point, of, delusions, of, persecution, despite, the, artist, s, increasing, recognition, hateful, press, releases, appeared, and, he, received, numerous, threatening, letters, c, zanne, s, paintings, were, not, well, received, among, the, petty, bourgeoisie, of, aix, in, 1903, henri, rochefort, visited, the, auction, of, paintings, that, had, been, in, zola, s, possession, and, published, on, 9, march, 1903, in, l, intransigeant, a, highly, critical, article, entitled, love, for, the, ugly, rochefort, describes, how, spectators, had, supposedly, experienced, laughing, fits, when, seeing, the, paintings, of, an, ultra, impressionist, named, c, zanne, the, public, in, aix, was, outraged, and, for, many, days, copies, of, l, intransigeant, appeared, on, c, zanne, s, door, mat, with, messages, asking, him, to, leave, the, town, he, was, dishonouring, i, don, t, understand, the, world, and, the, world, doesn, t, understand, me, so, i, withdrew, from, the, world, said, old, c, zanne, to, his, coachman, when, c, zanne, deposited, his, will, with, a, notary, in, september, 1902, he, excluded, his, wife, hortense, from, the, inheritance, and, declared, his, son, paul, to, be, the, sole, heir, hortense, is, said, to, have, burned, the, mementos, of, his, mother, in, 1903, he, exhibited, for, the, first, time, at, the, newly, established, salon, d, automne, paris, autumn, salon, the, painter, and, art, theorist, mile, bernard, first, visited, him, for, a, month, in, february, 1904, and, published, an, article, about, the, painter, in, l, occident, magazine, in, july, c, zanne, was, then, working, on, a, vanitas, still, life, with, three, skulls, on, an, oriental, carpet, bernard, reported, that, this, painting, changed, colour, and, form, every, day, during, his, stay, although, it, appeared, complete, from, day, one, he, later, regarded, this, work, as, c, zanne, s, legacy, and, summed, it, up, truly, his, way, of, working, was, a, reflection, with, a, brush, in, his, hand, in, the, memento, mori, still, lifes, that, he, created, several, times, c, zanne, s, increasing, depression, of, old, age, was, evident, which, in, his, letters, since, 1896, with, comments, such, as, life, is, beginning, to, be, deadly, monotonous, for, me, were, echoed, an, exchange, of, letters, with, bernard, continued, until, c, zanne, s, death, he, first, published, his, memoirs, souvenirs, sur, paul, c, zanne, in, the, mercure, de, france, in, 1907, and, in, 1912, they, appeared, in, book, form, from, 15, october, to, 15, november, 1904, an, entire, room, of, the, salon, d, automne, was, furnished, with, the, works, of, c, zanne, in, 1905, an, exhibition, was, held, in, london, in, which, his, work, was, also, shown, the, galerie, vollard, exhibited, his, works, in, june, and, the, salon, d, automne, followed, in, turn, from, 19, october, to, 25, november, with, 10, paintings, the, art, historian, and, patron, karl, ernst, osthaus, who, had, founded, the, museum, folkwang, in, 1902, visited, c, zanne, on, 13, april, 1906, in, the, hope, of, being, able, to, purchase, a, painting, by, the, artist, his, wife, gertrud, probably, took, the, last, photograph, of, c, zanne, osthaus, described, his, visit, in, his, work, a, visit, to, c, zanne, published, in, the, same, year, despite, the, later, successes, c, zanne, was, only, ever, able, to, approach, his, goals, on, 5, september, 1906, he, wrote, to, his, son, paul, finally, i, want, to, tell, you, that, as, a, painter, i, am, becoming, more, clairvoyant, to, nature, but, that, it, is, always, very, difficult, for, me, to, realize, my, feelings, i, cannot, reach, the, intensity, that, unfolds, before, my, senses, i, do, not, possess, that, wonderful, richness, of, colour, that, animates, nature, on, 15, october, 1906, c, zanne, was, caught, in, a, storm, while, working, in, the, field, after, working, for, two, hours, he, decided, to, go, home, but, on, the, way, he, collapsed, and, lost, consciousness, he, was, taken, home, by, a, passing, driver, of, a, laundry, cart, due, to, hypothermia, he, contracted, severe, pneumonia, his, old, housekeeper, rubbed, his, arms, and, legs, to, restore, the, circulation, as, a, result, he, regained, consciousness, the, next, day, c, zanne, went, out, into, the, garden, to, work, on, his, last, painting, portrait, of, the, gardener, vallier, and, wrote, an, impatient, letter, to, his, paint, dealer, bemoaning, the, delay, in, the, delivery, of, paint, but, later, on, he, fainted, vallier, with, whom, he, was, working, called, for, help, he, was, put, to, bed, and, he, never, left, it, his, wife, hortense, and, son, paul, received, a, telegram, from, the, housekeeper, but, they, were, too, late, he, died, a, few, days, later, on, 22, october, 1906, of, pneumonia, at, the, age, of, 67, and, was, buried, at, the, saint, pierre, cemetery, in, his, hometown, of, aix, en, provence, various, periods, in, the, work, and, life, of, c, zanne, have, been, defined, c, zanne, s, early, dark, period, was, influenced, by, the, works, of, french, romanticism, and, early, realism, models, were, eug, ne, delacroix, and, gustave, courbet, his, paintings, are, characterized, by, a, thick, application, of, paint, high, contrast, dark, tones, with, pronounced, shadows, the, use, of, pure, black, and, other, tones, mixed, with, black, brown, gray, and, prussian, blue, occasionally, a, few, white, dots, or, green, and, red, brushstrokes, are, added, to, brighten, up, enlivening, the, monochrome, monotony, the, themes, of, his, pictures, from, this, period, are, portraits, of, family, members, or, demonic, erotic, content, in, which, his, own, traumatic, experiences, are, reminiscent, they, differ, sharply, from, his, earlier, watercolours, and, sketches, at, the, cole, sp, ciale, de, dessin, at, aix, en, provence, in, 1859, and, their, violence, of, expression, is, in, contrast, to, his, subsequent, works, in, 1866, 67, inspired, by, the, example, of, courbet, c, zanne, painted, a, series, of, paintings, with, a, palette, knife, he, later, called, these, works, mostly, portraits, une, couillarde, a, coarse, word, for, ostentatious, virility, lawrence, gowing, has, written, that, c, zanne, s, palette, knife, phase, was, not, only, the, invention, of, modern, expressionism, although, it, was, incidentally, that, the, idea, of, art, as, emotional, ejaculation, made, its, first, appearance, at, this, moment, among, the, couillarde, paintings, are, a, series, of, portraits, of, his, uncle, dominique, in, which, c, zanne, achieved, a, style, that, was, as, unified, as, impressionism, was, fragmentary, later, works, of, the, dark, period, include, several, erotic, or, violent, subjects, such, as, women, dressing, c, 1867, the, abduction, c, 1867, and, the, murder, c, 1867, 68, which, depicts, a, man, stabbing, a, woman, who, is, held, down, by, his, female, accomplice, camille, pissarro, lived, in, pontoise, there, and, in, auvers, he, and, c, zanne, painted, landscapes, together, for, a, long, time, afterwards, c, zanne, described, himself, as, pissarro, s, pupil, referring, to, him, as, god, the, father, as, well, as, saying, we, all, stem, from, pissarro, under, pissarro, s, influence, c, zanne, began, to, abandon, dark, colours, and, his, canvases, grew, much, brighter, and, he, now, used, a, colour, palette, based, purely, on, the, basic, tones, yellow, red, and, blue, in, doing, so, he, broke, away, from, his, technique, of, heavy, often, overloaded, looking, application, of, paint, and, adopted, the, loose, painting, technique, of, his, role, models, consisting, of, brushstrokes, placed, side, by, side, portraits, and, figurative, compositions, receded, in, these, years, c, zanne, subsequently, created, landscape, paintings, in, which, the, illusionistic, deep, space, was, canceled, more, and, more, clearly, the, objects, continue, to, be, understood, as, volumes, and, reduced, to, their, basic, geometric, shapes, this, design, method, is, transferred, to, the, entire, picture, area, the, painterly, gesture, now, treats, the, distance, in, a, similar, way, to, the, objects, themselves, giving, the, impression, of, a, long, distance, effect, in, this, way, c, zanne, left, the, traditional, pictorial, space, on, the, one, hand, but, on, the, other, hand, counteracted, the, dissolving, impression, of, impressionist, pictorial, works, the, period, of, synthesis, followed, in, which, c, zanne, completely, broke, away, from, the, impressionist, style, of, painting, he, solidified, the, forms, by, applying, paint, diagonally, across, the, surface, eliminated, the, perspective, representation, to, create, the, depth, of, the, picture, and, directed, his, attention, to, the, balance, of, the, composition, during, this, period, he, increasingly, created, landscape, and, figure, paintings, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, joachim, gasquet, he, wrote, the, coloured, surfaces, always, the, surfaces, the, colourful, place, where, the, soul, of, the, surfaces, trembles, the, prismatic, warmth, the, encounter, of, the, surfaces, in, the, sunlight, i, design, my, surfaces, with, my, shades, on, the, palette, understand, me, the, areas, must, be, clearly, visible, definitely, but, they, have, to, be, distributed, correctly, they, have, to, flow, into, one, another, everything, has, to, play, together, and, yet, create, contrasts, it, s, all, about, the, volume, the, still, lifes, that, c, zanne, painted, from, the, late, 1880s, are, another, focus, of, his, work, he, refrained, from, rendering, the, motifs, in, linear, perspective, and, instead, depicted, them, in, the, dimensions, that, made, sense, to, him, in, terms, of, composition, a, pear, for, example, can, be, oversized, in, order, to, achieve, inner, balance, and, an, exciting, composition, he, built, his, arrangements, in, the, studio, in, addition, to, the, fruit, there, are, jugs, pots, and, plates, and, occasionally, a, putto, often, surrounded, by, a, white, puffy, tablecloth, that, lends, the, subject, a, baroque, opulence, it, is, not, the, objects, that, should, attract, attention, but, the, arrangement, of, the, shapes, and, colours, on, the, surface, c, zanne, developed, the, composition, from, individual, dabs, of, paint, spread, across, the, canvas, from, which, the, form, and, volume, of, the, object, gradually, build, up, achieving, the, balance, of, these, patches, of, colour, on, the, canvas, required, a, slow, process, so, c, zanne, often, worked, on, a, painting, for, a, long, time, initially, only, portraying, family, members, or, friends, c, zanne, s, better, financial, position, allowed, him, to, hire, a, professional, model, a, young, italian, named, michelangelo, di, rosa, for, the, boy, in, the, red, vest, 1888, 1890, one, of, his, best, known, paintings, di, rosa, was, represented, in, four, paintings, and, two, watercolours, many, of, his, later, works, the, so, called, lyrical, period, such, as, the, cycle, of, the, bathers, are, characterized, by, a, turn, to, freely, invented, figures, in, the, landscape, c, zanne, created, about, 140, paintings, and, sketches, on, the, theme, of, the, bathing, scenes, here, you, can, find, his, admiration, for, classical, painting, which, seeks, to, unite, man, and, nature, in, harmony, in, arcadian, idylls, in, the, last, seven, years, he, created, three, large, format, versions, of, the, great, bathers, les, grandes, baigneuses, with, the, 208, 249, cm, work, on, display, in, philadelphia, being, the, largest, c, zanne, was, concerned, with, the, composition, and, the, interplay, of, shapes, and, colours, of, nature, and, figures, for, his, paintings, at, this, time, he, used, sketches, and, photographs, as, templates, since, he, did, not, like, the, presence, of, naked, models, c, zanne, painted, five, versions, of, the, card, players, les, joueurs, de, cartes, in, 1890, and, 1895, in, which, the, same, person, is, represented, in, different, variants, for, the, card, players, he, used, farmers, and, day, laborers, who, worked, in, the, fields, near, the, jas, de, bouffan, as, models, they, are, not, genre, pictures, even, if, they, show, scenes, from, everyday, life, the, motif, is, constructed, according, to, strict, laws, of, colour, and, form, the, area, around, the, montagne, sainte, victoire, was, one, of, the, most, important, themes, of, his, later, years, from, a, vantage, point, above, his, studio, later, called, terrain, des, paintres, he, painted, several, views, of, the, mountain, a, precise, observation, of, nature, was, a, prerequisite, for, c, zanne, s, painting, in, order, to, paint, a, landscape, correctly, i, first, have, to, recognize, the, geological, stratification, in, total, he, painted, more, than, 30, oil, paintings, and, 45, watercolours, of, the, mountains, and, he, wrote, to, a, friend, in, the, 1890s, art, is, a, harmony, parallel, to, nature, c, zanne, was, primarily, concerned, with, watercolour, painting, in, his, late, work, as, he, realized, that, the, specific, application, of, his, method, could, be, particularly, evident, in, this, medium, the, late, watercolours, also, had, an, effect, on, his, oil, paintings, for, example, in, the, study, with, bathers, 1902, 1906, in, which, a, depiction, full, of, empty, spaces, flanked, by, colour, appears, to, be, complete, the, painter, and, art, critic, roger, fry, emphasized, this, in, his, seminal, c, zanne, publication, c, zanne, a, study, of, his, development, from, 1927, that, after, 1885, the, watercolour, technique, had, a, strong, influence, on, his, painting, with, oil, paints, the, watercolours, in, vollard, s, c, zanne, monograph, of, 1914, and, in, julius, meier, graefe, s, picture, portfolio, edited, in, 1918, with, ten, facsimiles, based, on, the, watercolours, became, known, to, a, larger, group, of, interested, parties, only, lightly, coloured, pencil, studies, which, occasionally, appeared, in, sketch, albums, stand, next, to, carefully, coloured, works, many, watercolours, are, equal, to, the, realizations, on, canvas, and, form, an, autonomous, group, of, works, in, terms, of, subject, matter, landscape, watercolours, dominate, followed, by, figure, paintings, and, still, lifes, while, portraits, in, contrast, to, paintings, and, drawings, are, rarer, c, zanne, s, early, work, is, often, concerned, with, the, figure, in, the, landscape, and, includes, many, paintings, of, groups, of, large, heavy, figures, in, the, landscape, imaginatively, painted, later, in, his, career, he, became, more, interested, in, working, from, direct, observation, and, gradually, developed, a, light, airy, painting, style, nevertheless, in, c, zanne, s, mature, work, there, is, the, development, of, a, solidified, almost, architectural, style, of, painting, throughout, his, life, he, struggled, to, develop, an, authentic, observation, of, the, seen, world, by, the, most, accurate, method, of, representing, it, in, paint, that, he, could, find, to, this, end, he, structurally, ordered, whatever, he, perceived, into, simple, forms, and, colour, planes, his, statement, i, want, to, make, of, impressionism, something, solid, and, lasting, like, the, art, in, the, museums, and, his, contention, that, he, was, recreating, poussin, after, nature, underscored, his, desire, to, unite, observation, of, nature, with, the, permanence, of, classical, composition, as, with, the, old, masters, for, c, zanne, the, basis, of, painting, was, drawing, but, the, prerequisite, for, all, work, was, subordination, to, the, object, or, the, eye, or, pure, looking, all, the, painter, s, intentions, must, be, silent, he, should, silence, all, voices, of, prejudice, forget, forget, create, silence, be, a, perfect, echo, the, landscape, is, reflected, becomes, human, thinks, in, me, i, climb, with, her, to, the, roots, of, the, world, we, germinate, a, tender, excitement, seizes, me, and, from, the, roots, of, this, excitement, then, rises, the, juice, the, colour, i, was, born, in, the, real, world, i, see, in, order, to, paint, that, then, the, craft, must, be, used, but, a, humble, craft, that, obeys, and, is, ready, to, transmit, unconsciously, in, addition, to, oil, paintings, and, watercolours, c, zanne, left, behind, an, extensive, oeuvre, of, more, than, 1200, drawings, which, hidden, in, the, cupboards, and, folders, of, the, studio, during, his, lifetime, only, began, to, interest, collectors, in, the, 1930s, they, form, the, working, material, for, his, works, and, show, detailed, sketches, observation, notes, and, traces, of, c, zanne, s, sometimes, difficult, to, decipher, stages, on, the, way, to, the, realization, of, the, picture, their, task, linked, to, the, process, of, creating, the, respective, work, was, to, give, the, overall, structure, and, the, object, designations, within, the, pictorial, organism, even, in, old, age, portraits, and, figure, drawings, were, made, based, on, models, from, antique, sculptures, and, baroque, paintings, from, the, louvre, which, gave, him, clarity, about, the, isolation, of, plastic, phenomena, therefore, the, black, and, white, of, the, drawings, was, an, essential, prerequisite, for, c, zanne, s, colour, designs, paul, c, zanne, was, the, first, artist, to, begin, breaking, down, objects, into, simple, geometric, shapes, in, his, much, quoted, letter, of, 15, april, 1904, to, the, painter, and, art, theorist, mile, bernard, who, had, met, c, zanne, in, his, last, years, he, wrote, treat, nature, according, to, cylinder, sphere, and, cone, and, put, the, whole, in, perspective, like, this, that, each, side, of, an, object, of, a, surface, leads, to, a, central, point, c, zanne, realized, his, painting, ideas, in, the, paintings, of, montagne, sainte, victoire, and, his, still, lifes, in, his, pictorial, conception, even, a, mountain, is, understood, as, a, superimposition, of, forms, spaces, and, structures, that, rise, above, the, ground, mile, bernard, wrote, of, c, zanne, s, unusual, way, of, working, he, began, with, the, shadow, parts, and, with, one, spot, on, which, he, put, a, second, larger, one, then, a, third, until, all, these, shades, covering, each, other, modelled, the, object, with, their, colouring, it, was, then, that, i, realized, that, a, law, of, harmony, was, guiding, his, work, and, that, these, modulations, had, a, direction, preordained, in, his, mind, in, this, preordained, direction, for, c, zanne, lay, the, real, secret, of, painting, in, the, context, of, harmony, and, the, illusion, of, depth, to, the, collector, karl, ernst, osthaus, c, zanne, emphasized, on, 13, april, 1906, during, his, visit, to, aix, that, the, main, thing, in, a, picture, is, the, meeting, of, the, distance, the, colour, must, express, every, leap, into, the, depths, c, zanne, was, interested, in, the, simplification, of, naturally, occurring, forms, to, their, geometric, essentials, he, wanted, to, treat, nature, in, terms, of, the, cylinder, the, sphere, and, the, cone, a, tree, trunk, may, be, conceived, of, as, a, cylinder, an, apple, or, orange, a, sphere, for, example, additionally, c, zanne, s, desire, to, capture, the, truth, of, perception, led, him, to, explore, binocular, vision, graphically, rendering, slightly, different, yet, simultaneous, visual, perceptions, of, the, same, phenomena, to, provide, the, viewer, with, an, aesthetic, experience, of, depth, different, from, those, of, earlier, ideals, of, perspective, in, particular, single, point, perspective, his, interest, in, new, ways, of, modelling, space, and, volume, derived, from, the, stereoscopy, obsession, of, his, era, and, from, reading, hippolyte, taine, s, berkelean, theory, of, spatial, perception, c, zanne, s, innovations, have, prompted, critics, to, suggest, such, varied, explanations, as, sick, retinas, pure, vision, and, the, influence, of, the, steam, railway, c, zanne, preferred, to, use, these, terms, when, describing, his, painting, process, first, of, all, there, is, the, motif, by, which, he, not, only, meant, the, representational, concept, of, the, picture, but, also, the, motivation, for, his, tireless, work, of, observing, and, painting, aller, sur, le, motif, as, he, called, his, approach, to, work, therefore, meant, entering, into, a, relationship, with, an, external, object, that, moved, the, artist, inwardly, and, that, had, to, be, translated, into, a, picture, sensation, is, another, key, term, in, c, zanne, s, vocabulary, first, of, all, he, meant, visual, perception, in, the, sense, of, impression, i, e, an, optical, sensory, stimulus, emanating, from, the, object, at, the, same, time, it, includes, the, emotion, as, a, psychological, reaction, to, what, is, perceived, c, zanne, expressly, did, not, place, the, object, to, be, depicted, at, the, center, of, his, painterly, efforts, but, rather, the, sensation, painting, from, nature, does, not, mean, copying, the, object, it, means, realizing, its, sensations, the, medium, that, mediated, between, things, and, sensations, was, the, colour, although, c, zanne, left, it, open, to, what, extent, it, arises, from, things, or, is, an, abstraction, of, his, vision, c, zanne, used, the, third, term, r, alisation, to, describe, the, actual, painterly, activity, which, he, feared, would, fail, to, the, end, several, things, had, to, be, realized, at, the, same, time, first, the, motif, in, all, its, diversity, then, the, feelings, that, the, motif, triggered, in, him, and, finally, the, painting, itself, the, realization, of, which, could, bring, the, other, realizations, to, light, painting, therefore, meant, letting, those, opposing, movements, of, taking, in, and, giving, of, impression, and, expression, merge, into, one, another, in, a, single, gesture, the, realization, in, art, became, a, key, concept, in, c, zanne, s, thinking, and, acting, the, sometimes, longer, dates, for, creation, in, the, catalogues, of, c, zanne, s, works, do, not, always, indicate, that, the, exact, dating, cannot, be, clarified, even, if, c, zanne, rarely, dated, his, pictures, especially, since, he, worked, on, some, pictures, for, months, if, not, years, before, he, was, satisfied, with, the, result, the, artist, himself, regarded, many, of, his, paintings, as, unfinished, for, painting, was, a, never, ending, process, for, him, cataloging, c, zanne, s, works, turned, out, to, be, a, difficult, task, ambroise, vollard, made, the, first, attempt, a, multi, volume, photo, album, similar, to, his, catalogue, of, renoir, vollard, s, catalogue, never, materialized, however, georges, rivi, re, the, father, in, law, of, c, zanne, s, son, published, a, biography, of, the, artist, in, 1923, le, ma, tre, paul, c, zanne, that, included, a, chronological, and, annotated, list, of, many, of, the, painter, s, works, conceived, by, the, art, dealer, paul, rosenberg, the, first, complete, catalogue, raisonn, was, published, by, lionello, venturi, in, 1936, the, two, volume, c, zanne, son, art, son, oeuvre, became, the, definitive, catalogue, of, the, artist, s, work, for, over, five, decades, although, requiring, a, supplement, as, additional, works, were, discovered, and, new, scholarship, and, documentation, introduced, adrien, chappuis, the, drawings, of, paul, c, zanne, a, catalog, raisonn, was, published, by, thames, and, hudson, in, london, in, 1973, and, has, remained, the, classic, source, for, the, artist, s, graphic, work, john, rewald, continued, venturi, s, work, after, his, death, rewald, was, tasked, with, combining, venturi, s, planned, supplement, with, his, own, research, an, agreement, that, did, not, work, out, as, intended, after, years, of, studying, c, zanne, s, works, rewald, found, that, he, not, only, disagreed, with, many, of, his, predecessor, s, dates, but, a, number, of, his, attributions, as, well, he, therefore, set, about, developing, an, entirely, new, catalogue, raisonn, rewald, s, paul, c, zanne, the, watercolours, a, catalog, raisonn, was, published, by, thames, and, hudson, london, with, 645, illustrations, in, 1983, the, missing, dating, of, the, paintings, rewald, only, found, one, and, imprecise, formulations, of, the, pictorial, motif, such, as, paysage, or, quelques, pommes, caused, confusion, in, his, early, treatment, of, the, venturi, rewald, made, a, list, of, all, the, works, that, could, be, dated, without, a, stylistic, analysis, because, rewald, rejected, such, an, analysis, as, unscientific, he, continued, his, list, by, following, the, various, whereabouts, of, c, zanne, that, could, be, verified, by, documents, another, scheme, of, his, approach, was, to, rely, on, the, memories, of, the, people, portrayed, especially, if, they, were, c, zanne, s, contemporaries, based, on, his, own, interviews, he, made, chronological, assignments, among, the, works, that, could, be, dated, with, certainty, were, c, zanne, s, portrait, of, gustave, geffroy, which, the, sitter, confirmed, as, 1895, and, lake, annecy, which, the, artist, visited, only, once, in, 1896, rewald, died, in, 1994, he, was, not, able, to, fully, complete, his, work, when, in, doubt, rewald, s, tendency, was, to, include, rather, than, exclude, this, method, was, adopted, by, his, closest, associates, walter, feilchenfeldt, jr, son, of, the, art, dealer, walter, feilchenfeldt, and, jayne, warman, who, completed, the, catalog, and, provided, it, with, introductions, the, catalog, was, published, in, 1996, under, the, title, the, paintings, of, paul, c, zanne, a, catalog, raisonne, review, it, includes, the, 954, works, that, rewald, wanted, to, record, feilchenfeldt, warman, and, david, nash, went, on, to, produce, the, first, complete, catalogue, of, the, artist, work, since, with, the, paintings, watercolours, and, drawings, of, paul, c, zanne, an, online, catalogue, raisonn, yes, c, zanne, he, is, the, greatest, of, us, all, c, zanne, s, childhood, friend, the, writer, mile, zola, was, skeptical, about, c, zanne, s, human, and, artistic, qualities, saying, as, early, as, 1861, that, paul, may, have, the, genius, of, a, great, painter, but, he, will, never, have, the, genius, to, actually, become, one, the, slightest, obstacle, drives, him, to, despair, in, fact, it, was, c, zanne, s, self, doubt, and, refusal, to, make, artistic, compromises, as, well, as, his, rejection, of, social, concessions, that, led, his, contemporaries, to, regard, him, as, an, oddball, c, zanne, s, works, were, rejected, numerous, times, by, the, official, salon, in, paris, and, ridiculed, by, art, critics, when, exhibited, with, the, impressionists, yet, during, his, lifetime, c, zanne, was, considered, a, master, by, younger, artists, who, visited, his, studio, in, aix, in, the, circle, of, the, impressionists, however, c, zanne, was, given, special, recognition, camille, pissarro, pierre, auguste, renoir, claude, monet, and, edgar, degas, spoke, enthusiastically, about, his, work, and, pissarro, said, i, think, it, will, be, centuries, before, we, get, an, account, of, it, a, portrait, of, c, zanne, was, painted, by, his, friend, and, mentor, pissarro, in, 1874, and, in, 1901, the, co, founder, of, the, nabis, group, maurice, denis, created, hommage, c, zanne, showing, c, zanne, s, painting, still, life, with, fruit, on, the, easel, amidst, artist, friends, at, the, vollard, gallery, originally, owned, by, paul, gauguin, hommage, c, zanne, was, later, acquired, by, french, writer, and, denis, friend, andr, gide, who, owned, it, until, 1928, it, is, now, on, display, at, the, mus, e, d, orsay, the, first, joint, impressionist, exhibition, in, paris, from, april, to, may, 1874, attracted, extensive, criticism, audiences, and, art, critics, for, whom, the, ideal, of, the, cole, de, beaux, arts, was, proof, of, the, existence, of, art, burst, out, laughing, one, critic, claimed, that, monet, painted, by, loading, his, paints, in, a, gun, and, shooting, them, at, the, canvas, a, colleague, performed, an, indian, dance, in, front, of, a, painting, by, c, zanne, and, shouted, hugh, i, am, the, walking, impression, the, avenging, palette, knife, monet, s, boulevard, des, capucines, the, house, of, the, hanged, man, and, the, modern, olympia, by, mr, c, zanne, hugh, hugh, in, 1883, the, french, writer, joris, karl, huysmans, replied, to, pissarro, in, a, letter, to, pissarro, s, accusation, that, c, zanne, was, only, briefly, mentioned, in, huysman, s, book, l, art, moderne, by, suggesting, that, c, zanne, s, view, of, the, motifs, was, distorted, by, astigmatism, but, it, there, is, certainly, an, eye, defect, involved, which, i, am, assured, he, is, also, aware, of, five, years, later, in, la, cravache, magazine, his, judgment, became, more, positive, when, he, described, c, zanne, s, works, as, strange, yet, real, and, as, revelations, designated, the, art, dealer, ambroise, vollard, first, came, into, contact, with, c, zanne, s, works, in, 1892, through, the, paint, dealer, tanguy, who, had, exhibited, them, in, his, shop, in, the, rue, clauzel, in, montmartre, in, return, for, the, delivery, of, painting, utensils, vollard, recalled, the, lack, of, response, the, shop, was, rarely, visited, since, it, was, not, yet, fashionable, at, the, time, to, buy, atrocious, works, expensively, not, even, cheaply, tanguy, even, took, interested, parties, to, the, painter, s, studio, to, which, he, had, a, key, where, small, pictures, and, 100, francs, large, pictures, could, be, bought, at, a, fixed, price, of, 40, francs, the, journal, des, artistes, echoed, the, general, tone, of, the, time, anxious, to, ask, whether, its, sensitive, readers, would, not, be, sickened, at, the, sight, of, these, oppressive, abominations, which, exceed, the, measure, of, evil, permitted, by, law, the, art, critic, gustave, geffroy, was, one, of, the, few, critics, who, judged, c, zanne, s, work, fairly, and, unreservedly, during, his, lifetime, as, early, as, 25, march, 1894, he, wrote, in, the, journal, about, the, then, current, relationship, between, c, zanne, s, painting, and, the, efforts, of, younger, artists, that, c, zanne, had, become, a, kind, of, forerunner, to, which, the, symbolists, referred, and, that, there, was, a, direct, connection, between, c, zanne, s, painting, and, of, the, gauguins, bernards, and, even, vincent, van, goghs, a, year, later, after, the, successful, exhibition, at, the, vollard, gallery, in, 1895, geffroy, again, led, the, journal, he, is, a, great, truth, fanatic, fiery, and, naive, harsh, and, nuanced, he, will, go, to, the, louvre, between, these, two, chronicles, c, zanne, painted, the, portrait, of, geffroy, which, c, zanne, left, unfinished, because, he, was, dissatisfied, with, it, two, retrospectives, posthumously, paid, tribute, to, the, artist, in, 1907, from, 17, to, 29, june, the, bernheim, jeune, gallery, in, paris, showed, 79, watercolours, by, c, zanne, the, 5th, salon, d, automne, then, paid, homage, to, him, from, 5, october, to, 15, november, exhibiting, 49, paintings, and, seven, watercolours, in, two, rooms, in, the, grand, palais, visitors, included, the, art, historian, julius, meier, graefe, who, would, write, the, first, c, zanne, biography, in, 1910, harry, graf, kessler, and, rainer, maria, rilke, the, two, exhibitions, motivated, many, artists, such, as, georges, braque, andr, derain, wassily, kandinsky, henri, matisse, and, pablo, picasso, on, their, crucial, insights, for, 20th, century, art, in, 1910, some, of, c, zanne, s, paintings, were, shown, in, the, manet, and, the, post, impressionists, exhibition, in, london, another, one, followed, in, 1912, the, exhibition, had, been, initiated, by, the, painter, and, art, critic, roger, fry, in, the, grafton, galleries, which, wanted, to, introduce, english, art, lovers, to, the, work, of, douard, manet, georges, seurat, vincent, van, gogh, paul, gauguin, and, c, zanne, fry, used, the, name, to, describe, the, post, impressionist, style, although, the, exhibition, was, judged, negatively, by, critics, and, the, public, it, was, to, be, significant, in, the, history, of, modern, art, fry, recognized, the, extraordinary, value, of, the, path, that, artists, such, as, van, gogh, and, c, zanne, had, taken, in, expressing, their, personal, feelings, and, worldview, through, their, paintings, even, if, visitors, at, the, time, could, not, yet, understand, this, c, zanne, s, first, exhibition, in, the, united, states, took, place, in, 1910, 11, at, gallery, 291, in, new, york, in, 1913, his, works, were, exhibited, at, the, armory, show, in, new, york, it, was, a, groundbreaking, exhibition, of, modern, art, and, sculpture, although, here, too, the, exhibits, were, met, with, criticism, and, ridicule, today, these, artists, who, were, criticized, and, ridiculed, even, by, their, own, art, academies, during, their, lifetime, are, regarded, as, the, fathers, of, modern, art, c, zanne, c, zanne, was, the, father, of, all, of, us, a, kind, of, dear, god, of, painting, many, productive, misunderstandings, lie, hidden, in, the, reception, of, the, works, and, the, supposed, intentions, of, c, zanne, which, had, a, considerable, influence, on, the, further, course, and, development, of, modern, art, the, list, of, those, artists, who, more, or, less, justifiably, referred, to, him, and, who, coined, individual, elements, from, the, wealth, of, his, creative, approaches, for, their, own, pictorial, inventions, shows, an, almost, complete, art, history, of, the, 20th, century, as, early, as, 1910, guillaume, apollinaire, stated, that, most, of, the, new, painters, claim, to, be, successors, of, this, serious, painter, who, was, only, interested, in, art, immediately, after, c, zanne, s, death, in, 1906, stimulated, by, a, comprehensive, exhibition, of, his, watercolours, in, the, spring, of, 1907, at, the, galerie, bernheim, jeune, and, a, retrospective, in, october, 1907, at, the, salon, d, automne, in, paris, a, lively, examination, of, his, work, began, among, young, french, artists, henri, matisse, and, andr, derain, were, the, first, to, become, passionate, about, c, zanne, followed, by, picasso, fernand, l, ger, georges, braque, marcel, duchamp, and, piet, mondrian, this, enthusiasm, was, lasting, as, the, eighty, year, old, matisse, said, in, 1949, that, he, owed, the, most, to, the, art, of, c, zanne, braque, also, described, the, influence, of, c, zanne, on, his, art, as, an, initiation, and, said, in, 1961, c, zanne, was, the, first, to, turn, away, from, the, learned, mechanized, perspective, picasso, admitted, that, he, was, the, only, master, for, me, he, was, a, father, figure, to, us, it, was, he, who, offered, us, protection, c, zanne, expert, g, tz, adriani, notes, however, that, the, c, zanne, s, reception, by, cubists, particularly, by, the, albert, gleizes, and, jean, metzinger, who, placed, c, zanne, at, the, beginning, of, their, way, of, painting, in, their, 1912, treatise, du, cubisme, was, arbitrary, because, they, largely, ignored, the, motivation, gained, from, observing, nature, in, this, context, he, points, to, the, formalistic, misinterpretations, that, refer, to, mile, bernard, s, published, paper, from, 1907, which, refers, to, a, 1904, letter, c, zanne, wrote, advising, him, to, treat, nature, according, to, cylinder, sphere, and, cone, further, misinterpretations, of, this, kind, can, be, found, in, kazimir, malevich, s, 1919, text, on, the, new, systems, in, art, in, his, quote, c, zanne, did, not, intend, to, reinterpret, the, experience, of, nature, in, the, sense, of, orienting, himself, towards, cubic, form, elements, he, was, more, concerned, with, corresponding, to, the, object, forms, and, their, colouring, under, the, various, aspects, in, the, picture, one, of, the, many, examples, of, c, zanne, s, influence, on, modernism, is, the, 1888, painting, mardi, gras, in, the, pushkin, museum, which, shows, his, son, paul, with, his, friend, louis, guillaume, and, in, costumes, from, the, commedia, dell, arte, picasso, took, inspiration, from, it, for, the, harlequin, theme, in, his, pink, period, matisse, in, turn, took, up, the, theme, of, the, most, classic, painting, in, the, bathers, series, the, great, bathers, from, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, in, his, 1909, painting, the, bathers, numerous, artists, were, inspired, by, c, zanne, s, work, the, painter, paula, modersohn, becker, saw, c, zanne, s, paintings, in, paris, in, 1900, which, deeply, impressed, her, shortly, before, her, death, she, wrote, to, clara, westhoff, in, a, letter, on, 21, october, 1907, i, am, thinking, and, thinking, a, lot, these, days, about, c, zanne, and, how, he, is, one, of, the, three, or, four, painters, who, struck, me, like, a, thunderstorm, or, a, major, event, paul, klee, noted, in, his, diary, in, 1909, c, zanne, is, a, teacher, par, excellence, for, me, after, seeing, more, than, a, dozen, paintings, by, c, zanne, in, the, munich, secession, the, artist, group, der, blaue, reiter, referred, to, him, in, their, 1912, almanac, when, franz, marc, reported, on, the, kinship, between, el, greco, and, c, zanne, whose, works, he, understood, as, the, gateways, to, a, new, era, of, painting, again, kandinsky, who, had, seen, c, zanne, s, painting, at, the, 1907, retrospective, at, the, salon, d, automne, refers, to, c, zanne, in, his, 1912, treatise, on, the, spiritual, in, art, in, whose, work, he, found, a, strong, resonance, of, the, abstract, recognized, and, found, the, spiritual, part, of, his, beliefs, predetermined, in, him, el, lissitzky, emphasized, his, importance, for, the, russian, avant, garde, around, 1923, and, lenin, suggested, erecting, monuments, to, the, heroes, of, the, world, revolution, in, 1918, on, the, roll, of, honor, were, courbet, and, c, zanne, next, to, matisse, alberto, giacometti, dealt, most, extensively, with, c, zanne, s, style, of, representation, aristide, maillol, worked, on, a, c, zanne, monument, in, 1909, but, failed, due, to, rejection, by, the, city, of, aix, en, provence, c, zanne, was, also, an, important, authority, for, artists, of, the, newer, generation, jasper, johns, described, him, as, the, most, important, role, model, alongside, duchamp, and, leonardo, da, vinci, inspired, by, c, zanne, albert, gleizes, and, jean, metzinger, wrote, c, zanne, is, one, of, the, greatest, of, those, who, changed, the, course, of, art, history, from, him, we, have, learned, that, to, alter, the, colouring, of, an, object, is, to, alter, its, structure, his, work, proves, without, doubt, that, painting, is, not, or, not, any, longer, the, art, of, imitating, an, object, by, lines, and, colours, but, of, giving, plastic, form, to, our, nature, du, cubisme, 1912, along, with, the, work, of, vincent, van, gogh, and, paul, gauguin, the, work, of, c, zanne, with, its, sense, of, immediacy, and, incompletion, critically, influenced, matisse, and, others, prior, to, fauvism, and, expressionism, c, zanne, s, explorations, of, geometric, simplification, and, optical, phenomena, inspired, picasso, braque, metzinger, gleizes, gris, and, others, to, experiment, with, ever, more, complex, views, of, the, same, subject, and, eventually, to, the, fracturing, of, form, c, zanne, thus, sparked, one, of, the, most, revolutionary, areas, of, artistic, enquiry, of, the, 20th, century, one, which, was, to, affect, profoundly, the, development, of, modern, art, picasso, referred, to, c, zanne, as, the, father, of, us, all, and, claimed, him, as, my, one, and, only, master, other, painters, such, as, edgar, degas, pierre, auguste, renoir, paul, gauguin, kasimir, malevich, georges, rouault, paul, klee, and, henri, matisse, acknowledged, c, zanne, s, genius, ernest, hemingway, compared, his, writing, to, c, zanne, s, landscapes, as, he, describes, in, a, moveable, feast,

zanne, s, death, in, october, 2006, as, an, opportunity, to, trace, the, genesis, of, a, legend, c, zanne, encountered, rejection, and, incomprehension, before, he, was, allowed, to, rise, to, the, olympus, of, art, history, and, the, international, art, market, the, 2016, film, c, zanne, and, i, explores, the, friendship, between, the, artist, and, mile, zola, paul, c, zanne, figures,

with, mile, zola, is, explored, as, well, as, c, zanne, s, phobia, of, touch, and, his, painting, method, of, modulation, the, french, philosopher, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, argues, in, his, work, mis, re, de, la, philosophie, that, c, zanne, has, so, to, speak, the, sixth, sense, he, senses, the, reality, in, the, making, before, it, is, completed, in, normal, perception, so, the, painter, touches, on, the, sublime, when, he, sees, the, overwhelming, quality, of, the, mountainous, landscape, which, can, neither, be, represented, with, normal, language, nor, with, the, usual, painting, technique, lyotard, sums, it, up, one, can, also, say, that, the, uncanniness, of, the, oil, paintings, and, watercolours, dedicated, to, mountains, and, fruits, derives, both, from, a, deep, sense, of, the, disappearance, of, appearances, and, from, the, demise, of, the, visible, world, c, zanne, s, stylistic, approaches, and, beliefs, regarding, how, to, paint, were, analyzed, and, written, about, by, the, french, philosopher, maurice, merleau, ponty, who, is, primarily, known, for, his, association, with, phenomenology, and, existentialism, in, his, 1945, essay, entitled, c, zanne, s, doubt, merleau, ponty, discusses, how, c, zanne, gave, up, classic, artistic, elements, such, as, pictorial, arrangements, single, view, perspectives, and, outlines, that, enclosed, colour, in, an, attempt, to, get, a, lived, perspective, by, capturing, all, the, complexities, that, an, eye, observes, he, wanted, to, see, and, sense, the, objects, he, was, painting, rather, than, think, about, them, ultimately, he, wanted, to, get, to, the, point, where, sight, was, also, touch, he, would, take, hours, sometimes, to, put, down, a, single, stroke, because, each, stroke, needed, to, contain, the, air, the, light, the, object, the, composition, the, character, the, outline, and, the, style, a, still, life, might, have, taken, c, zanne, one, hundred, working, sessions, while, a, portrait, took, him, around, one, hundred, and, fifty, sessions, c, zanne, believed, that, while, he, was, painting, he, was, capturing, a, moment, in, time, that, once, passed, could, not, come, back, the, atmosphere, surrounding, what, he, was, painting, was, a, part, of, the, sensational, reality, he, was, painting, c, zanne, claimed, art, is, a, personal, apperception, which, i, embody, in, sensations, and, which, i, ask, the, understanding, to, organize, into, a, painting, the, increase, in, value, of, c, zanne, s, work, can, be, seen, from, the, auction, of, his, painting, rideau,
