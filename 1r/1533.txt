establishment, especially, the, officers, of, the, kwantung, army, he, promoted, a, policy, of, a, strong, fleet, to, project, force, through, gunboat, diplomacy, rather, than, a, fleet, used, primarily, for, the, transport, of, invasion, land, forces, as, some, of, his, political, opponents, in, the, army, wanted, this, stance, led, him, to, oppose, the, invasion, of, china, he, also, opposed, war, against, the, united, states, partly, because, of, his, studies, at, harvard, university, 1919, 1921, and, his, two, postings, as, a, naval, attach, in, washington, d, c, where, he, learned, to, speak, fluent, english, yamamoto, traveled, extensively, in, the, united, states, during, his, tour, of, duty, there, where, he, studied, american, customs, and, business, practices, he,

naval, conference, 1930, as, a, rear, admiral, and, the, london, naval, conference, 1935, as, a, vice, admiral, as, the, growing, military, influence, on, the, government, at, the, time, deemed, that, a, career, military, specialist, needed, to, accompany, the, diplomats, to, the, arms, limitations, talks, yamamoto, was, a, strong, proponent, of, naval, aviation, and, served, as, head, of, the, aeronautics, department, before, accepting, a, post, as, commander, of, the, first, carrier, division, yamamoto, opposed, the, japanese, invasion, of, northeast, china, in, 1931, the, subsequent, full, scale, land, war, with, china, in, 1937, and, the, tripartite, pact, with, nazi, germany, and, fascist, italy, in, 1940, as, deputy, navy, minister, he, apologized, to, united, states, ambassador, joseph, c, grew, for, the, bombing, of, the, gunboat, uss, panay, in, december, 1937, these, issues, made, him, a, target, of, assassination, threats, by, pro, war, militarists, throughout, 1938, many, young, army, and, naval, officers, began, to, speak, publicly, against, yamamoto, and, certain, other, japanese, admirals, such, as, mitsumasa, yonai, and, shigeyoshi, inoue, for, their, strong, opposition, to, a, tripartite, pact, with, nazi, germany, and, fascist, italy, which, the, admirals, saw, as, inimical, to, japan, s, natural, interests, 101, yamamoto, received, a, steady, stream, of, hate, mail, and, death, threats, from, japanese, nationalists, his, reaction, to, the, prospect, of, death, by, assassination, was, passive, and, accepting, the, admiral, wrote, to, die, for, emperor, and, nation, is, the, highest, hope, of, a, military, man, after, a, brave, hard, fight, the, blossoms, are, scattered, on, the, fighting, field, but, if, a, person, wants, to, take, a, life, instead, still, the, fighting, man, will, go, to, eternity, for, emperor, and, country, one, man, s, life, or, death, is, a, matter, of, no, importance, all, that, matters, is, the, empire, as, confucius, said, they, may, crush, cinnabar, yet, they, do, not, take, away, its, color, one, may, burn, a, fragrant, herb, yet, it, will, not, destroy, the, scent, they, may, destroy, my, body, yet, they, will, not, take, away, my, will, 101, 02, the, japanese, army, annoyed, at, yamamoto, s, unflinching, opposition, to, a, rome, berlin, tokyo, treaty, dispatched, military, police, to, guard, him, a, ruse, by, the, army, to, keep, an, eye, on, him, 102, 03, he, was, later, reassigned, from, the, naval, ministry, to, sea, as, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, combined, fleet, on, august, 30, 1939, this, was, done, as, one, of, the, last, acts, of, acting, navy, minister, mitsumasa, yonai, under, baron, hiranuma, kiichir, s, short, lived, administration, it, was, done, partly, to, make, it, harder, for, assassins, to, target, yamamoto, yonai, was, certain, that, if, yamamoto, remained, ashore, he, would, be, killed, before, the, year, ended, 103, yamamoto, was, promoted, to, admiral, on, november, 15, 1940, this, was, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, when, hideki, tojo, was, appointed, prime, minister, on, october, 18, 1941, many, political, observers, thought, that, yamamoto, s, career, was, essentially, over, 114, tojo, had, been, yamamoto, s, old, opponent, from, the, time, when, the, latter, served, as, japan, s, deputy, naval, minister, and, tojo, was, the, prime, mover, behind, japan, s, takeover, of, manchuria, it, was, believed, that, yamamoto, would, be, appointed, to, command, the, yokosuka, naval, base, a, nice, safe, demotion, with, a, big, house, and, no, power, at, all, 114, however, after, a, brief, stint, in, the, post, a, new, japanese, cabinet, was, announced, and, yamamoto, found, himself, returned, to, his, position, of, power, despite, his, open, conflict, with, tojo, and, other, members, of, the, army, s, oligarchy, who, favored, war, with, the, european, powers, and, the, united, states, two, of, the, main, reasons, for, yamamoto, s, political, survival, were, his, immense, popularity, within, the, fleet, where, he, commanded, the, respect, of, his, men, and, officers, and, his, close, relations, with, the, imperial, family, 115, he, also, had, the, acceptance, of, japan, s, naval, hierarchy, there, was, no, officer, more, competent, to, lead, the, combined, fleet, to, victory, than, admiral, yamamoto, his, daring, plan, for, the, pearl, harbor, attack, had, passed, through, the, crucible, of, the, japanese, naval, establishment, and, after, many, expressed, misgivings, his, fellow, admirals, had, realized, that, yamamoto, spoke, no, more, than, the, truth, when, he, said, that, japan, s, hope, for, victory, in, this, war, was, limited, by, time, and, oil, every, sensible, officer, of, the, navy, was, well, aware, of, the, perennial, oil, problems, also, it, had, to, be, recognized, that, if, the, enemy, could, seriously, disturb, japanese, merchant, shipping, then, the, fleet, would, be, endangered, even, more, 115, 116, consequently, yamamoto, stayed, in, his, post, with, tojo, now, in, charge, of, japan, s, highest, political, office, it, became, clear, the, army, would, lead, the, navy, into, a, war, about, which, yamamoto, had, serious, reservations, he, wrote, to, an, ultranationalist, should, hostilities, once, break, out, between, japan, and, the, united, states, it, would, not, be, enough, that, we, take, guam, and, the, philippines, nor, even, hawaii, and, san, francisco, to, make, victory, certain, we, would, have, to, march, into, washington, and, dictate, the, terms, of, peace, in, the, white, house, i, wonder, if, our, politicians, have, confidence, as, to, the, final, outcome, and, are, prepared, to, make, the, necessary, sacrifices, this, quote, was, spread, by, the, militarists, minus, the, last, sentence, so, it, was, interpreted, in, america, as, a, boast, that, japan, would, conquer, the, entire, continental, united, states, the, omitted, sentence, showed, yamamoto, s, counsel, of, caution, towards, a, war, that, could, cost, japan, dearly, nevertheless, yamamoto, accepted, the, reality, of, impending, war, and, planned, for, a, quick, victory, by, destroying, the, united, states, pacific, fleet, at, pearl, harbor, in, a, preventive, strike, while, simultaneously, thrusting, into, the, oil, and, rubber, rich, areas, of, southeast, asia, especially, the, dutch, east, indies, borneo, and, malaya, in, naval, matters, yamamoto, opposed, the, building, of, the, battleships, yamato, and, musashi, as, an, unwise, investment, of, resources, yamamoto, was, responsible, for, a, number, of, innovations, in, japanese, naval, aviation, although, remembered, for, his, association, with, aircraft, carriers, yamamoto, did, more, to, influence, the, development, of, land, based, naval, aviation, particularly, the, mitsubishi, g3m, and, g4m, medium, bombers, his, demand, for, great, range, and, the, ability, to, carry, a, torpedo, was, intended, to, conform, to, japanese, conceptions, of, bleeding, the, american, fleet, as, it, advanced, across, the, pacific, the, planes, did, achieve, long, range, but, long, range, fighter, escorts, were, not, available, these, planes, were, lightly, constructed, and, when, fully, fueled, they, were, especially, vulnerable, to, enemy, fire, this, earned, the, g4m, the, sardonic, nickname, the, flying, cigarette, lighter, yamamoto, would, eventually, die, in, one, of, these, aircraft, the, range, of, the, g3m, and, g4m, contributed, to, a, demand, for, great, range, in, a, fighter, aircraft, this, partly, drove, the, requirements, for, the, a6m, zero, which, was, as, noteworthy, for, its, range, as, for, its, maneuverability, both, qualities, were, again, purchased, at, the, expense, of, light, construction, and, flammability, that, later, contributed, to, the, a6m, s, high, casualty, rates, as, the, war, progressed, as, japan, moved, toward, war, during, 1940, yamamoto, gradually, moved, toward, strategic, as, well, as, tactical, innovation, again, with, mixed, results, prompted, by, talented, young, officers, such, as, lieutenant, commander, minoru, genda, yamamoto, approved, the, reorganization, of, japanese, carrier, forces, into, the, first, air, fleet, a, consolidated, striking, force, that, gathered, japan, s, six, largest, carriers, into, one, unit, this, innovation, gave, great, striking, capacity, but, also, concentrated, the, vulnerable, carriers, into, a, compact, target, yamamoto, also, oversaw, the, organization, of, a, similar, large, land, based, organization, in, the, 11th, air, fleet, which, would, later, use, the, g3m, and, g4m, to, neutralize, american, air, forces, in, the, philippines, and, sink, the, british, force, z, in, january, 1941, yamamoto, went, even, further, and, proposed, a, radical, revision, of, japanese, naval, strategy, for, two, decades, in, keeping, with, the, doctrine, of, captain, alfred, t, mahan, the, naval, general, staff, had, planned, in, terms, of, japanese, light, surface, forces, submarines, and, land, based, air, units, whittling, down, the, american, fleet, as, it, advanced, across, the, pacific, until, the, japanese, navy, engaged, it, in, a, climactic, kantai, kessen, decisive, battle, in, the, northern, philippine, sea, between, the, ryukyu, islands, and, the, marianas, with, battleships, fighting, in, traditional, battle, lines, correctly, pointing, out, this, plan, had, never, worked, even, in, japanese, war, games, and, painfully, aware, of, american, strategic, advantages, in, military, production, capacity, yamamoto, proposed, instead, to, seek, parity, with, the, americans, by, first, reducing, their, forces, with, a, preventive, strike, then, following, up, with, a, decisive, battle, fought, offensively, rather, than, defensively, yamamoto, hoped, but, probably, did, not, believe, that, if, the, americans, could, be, dealt, terrific, blows, early, in, the, war, they, might, be, willing, to, negotiate, an, end, to, the, conflict, the, naval, general, staff, proved, reluctant, to, go, along, and, yamamoto, was, eventually, driven, to, capitalize, on, his, popularity, in, the, fleet, by, threatening, to, resign, to, get, his, way, admiral, osami, nagano, and, the, naval, general, staff, eventually, caved, in, to, this, pressure, but, only, insofar, as, approving, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, in, january, 1941, yamamoto, began, developing, a, plan, to, attack, the, american, base, in, pearl, harbor, hawaii, which, the, japanese, continued, to, refine, during, the, next, months, on, november, 5, 1941, yamamoto, in, his, top, secret, operation, order, no, 1, issued, to, the, combined, fleet, the, empire, of, japan, must, drive, out, britain, and, america, from, greater, east, asia, and, hasten, the, settlement, of, china, whereas, in, the, event, that, britain, and, america, were, driven, out, from, the, philippines, and, dutch, east, indies, an, independent, self, supporting, economic, entity, will, be, firmly, established, mirroring, the, principle, of, the, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, in, another, personification, two, days, later, he, set, the, date, for, the, intended, surprise, attack, in, pearl, harbor, and, that, would, be, on, december, 7, for, one, simple, reason, it, was, a, sunday, the, day, that, american, military, personnel, would, be, least, alert, to, an, attack, the, first, air, fleet, commenced, preparations, for, the, pearl, harbor, raid, solving, a, number, of, technical, problems, along, the, way, including, how, to, launch, torpedoes, in, the, shallow, waters, of, pearl, harbor, and, how, to, craft, armor, piercing, bombs, by, machining, down, battleship, gun, projectiles, although, the, united, states, and, japan, were, officially, at, peace, the, first, air, fleet, of, six, carriers, attacked, on, december, 7, 1941, launching, 353, aircraft, against, pearl, harbor, and, other, locations, within, honolulu, in, two, waves, the, attack, was, a, success, according, to, the, parameters, of, the, mission, which, sought, to, sink, at, least, four, american, battleships, and, prevent, the, united, states, from, interfering, in, japan, s, southward, advance, for, at, least, six, months, three, american, aircraft, carriers, were, also, considered, a, choice, target, but, these, were, at, sea, at, the, time, in, the, end, four, american, battleships, were, sunk, four, were, damaged, and, eleven, other, cruisers, destroyers, and, auxiliaries, were, sunk, or, seriously, damaged, 188, american, aircraft, were, destroyed, and, 159, others, damaged, and, 2, 403, people, were, killed, and, 1, 178, others, wounded, the, japanese, lost, 64, servicemen, and, only, 29, aircraft, with, 74, others, damaged, by, anti, aircraft, fire, from, the, ground, the, damaged, aircraft, were, disproportionately, dive, and, torpedo, bombers, seriously, reducing, the, ability, to, exploit, the, first, two, waves, success, so, the, commander, of, the, first, air, fleet, naval, vice, admiral, chuichi, nagumo, withdrew, yamamoto, later, lamented, nagumo, s, failure, to, seize, the, initiative, to, seek, out, and, destroy, the, american, carriers, or, further, bombard, various, strategically, important, facilities, on, oahu, such, as, pearl, s, oil, tanks, nagumo, had, absolutely, no, idea, where, the, american, carriers, were, and, remaining, on, station, while, his, forces, looked, for, them, ran, the, risk, of, his, own, forces, being, found, first, and, attacked, while, his, aircraft, were, absent, searching, in, any, case, insufficient, daylight, remained, after, recovering, the, aircraft, from, the, first, two, waves, for, the, carriers, to, launch, and, recover, a, third, before, dark, and, nagumo, s, escorting, destroyers, lacked, the, fuel, capacity, to, loiter, long, much, has, been, made, of, yamamoto, s, hindsight, but, in, keeping, with, japanese, military, tradition, to, not, criticize, the, commander, on, the, spot, he, did, not, punish, nagumo, for, his, withdrawal, on, the, strategic, moral, and, political, level, the, attack, was, a, disaster, for, japan, rousing, americans, thirst, for, revenge, due, to, what, is, famously, called, a, sneak, attack, the, shock, of, the, attack, coming, in, an, unexpected, place, with, devastating, results, and, without, a, declaration, of, war, galvanized, the, american, public, s, determination, to, avenge, the, attack, when, asked, by, prime, minister, fumimaro, konoe, in, mid, 1941, about, the, outcome, of, a, possible, war, with, the, united, states, yamamoto, made, a, well, known, and, prophetic, statement, if, ordered, to, fight, he, said, i, shall, run, wild, considerably, for, the, first, six, months, or, a, year, but, i, have, utterly, no, confidence, for, the, second, and, third, years, his, prediction, would, be, validated, as, japan, easily, conquered, territories, and, islands, in, asia, and, the, pacific, for, the, first, six, months, of, the, war, before, suffering, a, major, defeat, at, the, battle, of, midway, on, june, 4, 7, 1942, which, ultimately, tilted, the, balance, of, power, in, the, pacific, toward, the, united, states, with, the, american, fleet, largely, neutralized, at, pearl, harbor, yamamoto, s, combined, fleet, turned, to, the, task, of, executing, the, larger, japanese, war, plan, devised, by, the, imperial, japanese, army, and, navy, general, staff, the, first, air, fleet, made, a, circuit, of, the, pacific, striking, american, australian, dutch, and, british, installations, from, wake, island, to, australia, to, ceylon, in, the, indian, ocean, the, 11th, air, fleet, caught, the, united, states, fifth, air, force, on, the, ground, in, the, philippines, hours, after, pearl, harbor, and, then, sank, the, british, force, z, s, battleship, hms, prince, of, wales, and, battlecruiser, hms, repulse, at, sea, under, yamamoto, s, able, subordinates, vice, admirals, jisabur, ozawa, nobutake, kond, and, ib, takahashi, the, japanese, swept, the, inadequate, remaining, american, british, dutch, and, australian, naval, assets, from, the, dutch, east, indies, in, a, series, of, amphibious, landings, and, surface, naval, battles, culminating, in, the, battle, of, the, java, sea, on, february, 27, 1942, along, with, the, occupation, of, the, dutch, east, indies, came, the, fall, of, singapore, on, february, 15, and, the, eventual, reduction, of, the, remaining, american, filipino, defensive, positions, in, the, philippines, on, the, bataan, peninsula, on, april, 9, and, corregidor, island, on, may, 6, the, japanese, had, secured, their, oil, and, rubber, rich, southern, resources, area, by, late, march, having, achieved, their, initial, aims, with, surprising, speed, and, little, loss, albeit, against, enemies, ill, prepared, to, resist, them, the, japanese, paused, to, consider, their, next, moves, yamamoto, and, a, few, japanese, military, leaders, and, officials, waited, hoping, that, the, united, states, or, great, britain, would, negotiate, an, armistice, or, a, peace, treaty, to, end, the, war, but, when, the, british, as, well, as, the, americans, expressed, no, interest, in, negotiating, japanese, thoughts, turned, to, securing, their, newly, seized, territory, and, acquiring, more, with, an, eye, to, driving, one, or, more, of, their, enemies, out, of, the, war, competing, plans, were, developed, at, this, stage, including, thrusts, to, the, west, against, british, india, south, against, australia, and, east, against, the, united, states, yamamoto, was, involved, in, this, debate, supporting, different, plans, at, different, times, with, varying, degrees, of, enthusiasm, and, for, varying, purposes, including, horse, trading, for, support, of, his, own, objectives, plans, included, ideas, as, ambitious, as, invading, india, or, australia, or, seizing, hawaii, these, grandiose, ventures, were, inevitably, set, aside, as, the, army, could, not, spare, enough, troops, from, china, for, the, first, two, which, would, require, a, minimum, of, 250, 000, men, nor, shipping, to, support, the, latter, two, transports, were, allocated, separately, to, the, navy, and, army, and, jealously, guarded, instead, the, imperial, general, staff, supported, an, army, thrust, into, burma, in, hopes, of, linking, up, with, indian, nationalists, revolting, against, british, rule, and, attacks, in, new, guinea, and, the, solomon, islands, designed, to, imperil, australia, s, lines, of, communication, with, the, united, states, yamamoto, argued, for, a, decisive, offensive, strike, in, the, east, to, finish, off, the, american, fleet, but, the, more, conservative, naval, general, staff, officers, were, unwilling, to, risk, it, on, april, 18, in, the, midst, of, these, debates, the, doolittle, raid, struck, tokyo, and, surrounding, areas, demonstrating, the, threat, posed, by, american, aircraft, carriers, and, giving, yamamoto, an, event, he, could, exploit, to, get, his, way, and, further, debate, over, military, strategy, came, to, a, quick, end, the, naval, general, staff, agreed, to, yamamoto, s, midway, island, mi, operation, subsequent, to, the, first, phase, of, the, operations, against, australia, s, link, with, america, and, concurrent, with, its, plan, to, invade, the, aleutian, islands, yamamoto, rushed, planning, for, the, midway, and, aleutians, missions, while, dispatching, a, force, under, vice, admiral, takeo, takagi, including, the, fifth, carrier, division, the, large, new, carriers, sh, kaku, and, zuikaku, to, support, the, effort, to, seize, the, islands, of, tulagi, and, guadalcanal, for, seaplane, and, airplane, bases, and, the, town, of, port, moresby, on, papua, new, guinea, s, south, coast, facing, australia, the, port, moresby, mo, operation, proved, an, unwelcome, setback, although, tulagi, and, guadalcanal, were, taken, the, port, moresby, invasion, fleet, was, compelled, to, turn, back, when, takagi, clashed, with, an, american, carrier, task, force, in, the, battle, of, the, coral, sea, in, early, may, although, the, japanese, sank, the, carrier, uss, lexington, and, damaged, the, uss, yorktown, the, americans, damaged, the, carrier, sh, kaku, so, badly, that, she, required, dockyard, repairs, and, the, japanese, lost, the, light, carrier, shoho, just, as, importantly, japanese, operational, mishaps, and, american, fighters, and, anti, aircraft, fire, devastated, the, dive, bomber, and, torpedo, plane, formations, of, both, sh, kaku, s, and, zuikaku, s, air, groups, these, losses, sidelined, zuikaku, while, she, awaited, replacement, aircraft, and, aircrews, and, saw, to, tactical, integration, and, training, these, two, ships, would, be, sorely, missed, a, month, later, at, midway, yamamoto, s, plan, for, midway, island, was, an, extension, of, his, efforts, to, knock, the, american, pacific, fleet, out, of, action, long, enough, for, japan, to, fortify, its, defensive, perimeter, in, the, pacific, island, chains, yamamoto, felt, it, necessary, to, seek, an, early, offensive, decisive, battle, this, plan, was, long, believed, to, have, been, to, draw, american, attention, and, possibly, carrier, forces, north, from, pearl, harbor, by, sending, his, fifth, fleet, one, carrier, one, light, carrier, four, battleships, eight, cruisers, 25, destroyers, and, four, transports, against, the, aleutians, raiding, dutch, harbor, on, unalaska, island, and, invading, the, more, distant, islands, of, kiska, and, attu, while, fifth, fleet, attacked, the, aleutians, first, mobile, force, four, carriers, two, battleships, three, cruisers, and, 12, destroyers, would, attack, midway, and, destroy, its, air, force, once, this, was, neutralized, second, fleet, one, light, carrier, two, battleships, 10,

failure, yamamoto, initiated, two, security, measures, the, first, was, an, aerial, reconnaissance, mission, operation, k, over, pearl, harbor, to, ascertain, if, the, american, carriers, were, there, the, second, was, a, picket, line, of, submarines, to, detect, the, movement, of, enemy, carriers, toward, midway, in, time, for, first, mobile, force, first, fleet, and, second, fleet, to, combine, against, it, in, the, event, the, first, measure, was, aborted, and, the, second, delayed, until, after, the, american, carriers, had, already, sortied, the, plan, was, a, compromise, and, hastily, prepared, apparently, so, it, could, be, launched, in, time, for, the, anniversary, of, the, battle, of, tsushima, but, appeared, well, thought, out, well, organized, and, finely, timed, when, viewed, from, a, japanese, viewpoint, against, four, fleet, carriers, two, light, carriers, seven, battleships, 14, cruisers, and, 42, destroyers, likely, to, be, in, the, area, of, the, main, battle, the, united, states, could, field, only, three, carriers, eight, cruisers, and, 15, destroyers, the, disparity, appeared, crushing, only, in, numbers, of, carrier, decks, available, aircraft, and, submarines, was, there, near, parity, between, the, two, sides, despite, various, mishaps, developed, in, the, execution, it, appeared, that, barring, something, unforeseen, yamamoto, held, all, the, cards, unknown, to, yamamoto, the, americans, had, learned, of, japanese, plans, thanks, to, the, code, breaking, of, japanese, naval, code, d, known, to, the, us, as, jn, 25, as, a, result, admiral, chester, nimitz, the, pacific, fleet, commander, was, able, to, place, his, outnumbered, forces, in, a, position, to, conduct, their, own, ambush, by, nimitz, s, calculation, his, three, available, carrier, decks, plus, midway, gave, him, rough, parity, with, nagumo, s, first, mobile, force, following, a, nuisance, raid, by, japanese, flying, boats, in, may, nimitz, dispatched, a, minesweeper, to, guard, the, intended, refueling, point, for, operation, k, near, french, frigate, shoals, causing, the, reconnaissance, mission, to, be, aborted, and, leaving, yamamoto, ignorant, of, whether, the, pacific, fleet, carriers, were, still, at, pearl, harbor, it, remains, unclear, why, yamamoto, permitted, the, earlier, attack, and, why, his, submarines, did, not, sortie, sooner, as, reconnaissance, was, essential, to, success, at, midway, nimitz, also, dispatched, his, carriers, toward, midway, early, and, they, passed, the, japanese, submarines, en, route, to, their, picket, line, positions, nimitz, s, carriers, positioned, themselves, to, ambush, the, kid, butai, striking, force, when, it, struck, midway, a, token, cruiser, and, destroyer, force, was, sent, toward, the, aleutians, but, otherwise, nimitz, ignored, them, on, june, 4, 1942, days, before, yamamoto, expected, them, to, interfere, in, the, midway, operation, american, carrier, based, aircraft, destroyed, the, four, carriers, of, the, kid, butai, catching, the, japanese, carriers, at, especially, vulnerable, times, with, his, air, power, destroyed, and, his, forces, not, yet, concentrated, for, a, fleet, battle, yamamoto, maneuvered, his, remaining, forces, still, strong, on, paper, to, trap, the, american, forces, he, was, unable, to, do, so, because, his, initial, dispositions, had, placed, his, surface, combatants, too, far, from, midway, and, because, admiral, raymond, spruance, prudently, withdrew, to, the, east, to, further, defend, midway, island, believing, based, on, a, mistaken, submarine, report, the, japanese, still, intended, to, invade, not, knowing, several, battleships, including, the, powerful, yamato, were, in, the, japanese, order, of, battle, he, did, not, comprehend, the, severe, risk, of, a, night, surface, battle, in, which, his, carriers, and, cruisers, would, be, at, a, disadvantage, however, his, move, to, the, east, avoided, that, possibility, correctly, perceiving, he, had, lost, and, could, not, bring, surface, forces, into, action, yamamoto, withdrew, the, defeat, marked, the, high, tide, of, japanese, expansion, yamamoto, s, plan, has, been, the, subject, of, much, criticism, some, historians, state, it, violated, the, principle, of, concentration, of, force, and, was, overly, complex, others, point, to, similarly, complex, allied, operations, such, as, operation, mb8, that, were, successful, and, note, the, extent, to, which, the, american, intelligence, coup, derailed, the, operation, before, it, began, had, yamamoto, s, dispositions, not, denied, nagumo, adequate, pre, attack, reconnaissance, assets, both, the, american, cryptanalytic, success, and, the, unexpected, appearance, of, the, american, carriers, would, have, been, irrelevant, the, battle, of, midway, checked, japanese, momentum, but, the, japanese, navy, was, still, a, powerful, force, capable, of, regaining, the, initiative, it, planned, to, resume, the, thrust, with, operation, fs, aimed, at, eventually, taking, fiji, and, samoa, to, cut, the, american, lifeline, to, australia, yamamoto, remained, as, commander, in, chief, retained, at, least, partly, to, avoid, diminishing, the, morale, of, the, combined, fleet, however, he, had, lost, face, as, a, result, of, the, midway, defeat, and, the, naval, general, staff, were, disinclined, to, indulge, in, further, gambles, this, reduced, yamamoto, to, pursuing, the, classic, defensive, decisive, battle, strategy, he, had, attempted, to, avoid, yamamoto, committed, combined, fleet, units, to, a, series, of, small, attrition, actions, across, the, south, and, central, pacific, that, stung, the, americans, but, in, return, suffered, losses, he, could, ill, afford, three, major, efforts, to, beat, the, americans, moving, on, guadalcanal, precipitated, a, pair, of, carrier, battles, that, yamamoto, commanded, personally, the, battles, of, the, eastern, solomons, and, santa, cruz, islands, in, september, and, october, respectively, and, finally, a, pair, of, wild, surface, engagements, in, november, all, timed, to, coincide, with, japanese, army, pushes, the, effort, was, wasted, when, the, army, could, not, hold, up, its, end, of, the, operation, yamamoto, s, naval, forces, won, a, few, victories, and, inflicted, considerable, losses, and, damage, to, the, american, fleet, in, several, battles, around, guadalcanal, which, included, the, battles, of, savo, island, cape, esperance, and, tassafaronga, but, he, could, never, draw, the, united, states, into, a, decisive, fleet, action, as, a, result, japanese, naval, strength, declined, to, boost, morale, following, the, defeat, at, guadalcanal, yamamoto, decided, to, make, an, inspection, tour, throughout,
