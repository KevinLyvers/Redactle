portable, after, seeing, the, big, mural, the, art, critic, clement, greenberg, wrote, i, took, one, look, at, it, and, i, thought, now, that, s, great, art, and, i, knew, jackson, was, the, greatest, painter, this, country, had, produced, the, catalog, introducing, his, first, exhibition, described, pollock, s, talent, as, volcanic, it, has, fire, it, is, unpredictable, it, is, undisciplined, it, spills, out, of, itself, in, a, mineral, prodigality, not, yet, crystallized, pollock, s, most, famous, paintings, were, made, during, the, drip, period, between, 1947, and, 1950, he, became, famous, following, an, august, 8, 1949, four, page, spread, in, life, magazine, that, asked, is, he, the, greatest, living, painter, in, the, united, states, thanks, to, the, mediation, of, alfonso, ossorio, a, close, friend, of, pollock, and, the, art, historian, michel, tapi, the, young, gallery, owner, paul, facchetti, from, march, 7, 1952, managed, to, realize, the, first, exhibition, of, pollock, s, works, from, 1948, to, 1951, in, his, studio, paul, facchetti, in, paris, and, in, europe, at, the, peak, of, his, fame, pollock, abruptly, abandoned, the, drip, style, pollock, s, drip, paintings, were, influenced, by, the, artist, janet, sobel, the, art, critic, clement, greenberg, would, later, report, that, pollock, admitted, to, him, that, sobel, s, work, had, made, an, impression, on, him, pollock, s, work, after, 1951, was, darker, in, color, including, a, collection, painted, in, black, on, unprimed, canvases, these, paintings, have, been, referred, to, as, his, black, pourings, and, when, he, exhibited, them, at, the, betty, parsons, gallery, in, new, york, none, of, them, sold, parsons, later, sold, one, to, a, friend, at, half, the, price, these, works, show, pollock, attempting, to, find, a, balance, between, abstraction, and, depictions, of, the, figure, he, later, returned, to, using, color, and, continued, with, figurative, elements, during, this, period, pollock, had, moved, to, the, sidney, janis, gallery, a, more, commercial, gallery, the, demand, for, his, work, from, collectors, was, great, in, response, to, this, pressure, along, with, personal, frustration, his, alcoholism, deepened, pollock, and, lee, krasner, met, while, they, both, exhibited, at, the, mcmillen, gallery, in, 1942, krasner, was, unfamiliar, yet, intrigued, with, pollock, s, work, and, went, to, his, apartment, unannounced, to, meet, him, following, the, gallery, exhibition, in, october, 1945, pollock, and, krasner, were, married, in, a, church, with, two, witnesses, present, for, the, event, in, november, they, moved, out, of, the, city, to, the, springs, area, of, east, hampton, on, the, south, shore, of, long, island, with, the, help, of, a, down, payment, loan, from, peggy, guggenheim, they, bought, a, wood, frame, house, and, barn, at, 830, springs, fireplace, road, pollock, converted, the, barn, into, a, studio, in, that, space, he, perfected, his, big, drip, technique, of, working, with, paint, with, which, he, would, become, permanently, identified, when, the, couple, found, themselves, free, from, work, they, enjoyed, spending, their, time, together, cooking, and, baking, working, on, the, house, and, garden, and, entertaining, friends, krasner, s, influence, on, her, husband, s, art, was, something, critics, began, to, reassess, by, the, latter, half, of, the, 1960s, due, to, the, rise, of, feminism, at, the, time, krasner, s, extensive, knowledge, and, training, in, modern, art, and, techniques, helped, her, bring, pollock, up, to, date, with, what, contemporary, art, should, be, krasner, is, often, considered, to, have, tutored, her, husband, in, the, tenets, of, modernistic, painting, pollock, was, then, able, to, change, his, style, to, fit, a, more, organized, and, cosmopolitan, genre, of, modern, art, and, krasner, became, the, one, judge, he, could, trust, at, the, beginning, of, the, two, artists, marriage, pollock, would, trust, his, peers, opinions, on, what, did, or, did, not, work, in, his, pieces, krasner, was, also, responsible, for, introducing, him, to, many, collectors, critics, and, artists, including, herbert, matter, who, would, help, further, his, career, as, an, emerging, artist, art, dealer, john, bernard, myers, once, said, there, would, never, have, been, a, jackson, pollock, without, a, lee, pollock, whereas, fellow, painter, fritz, bultman, referred, to, pollock, as, krasner, s, creation, her, frankenstein, both, men, recognizing, the, immense, influence, krasner, had, on, pollock, s, career, jackson, pollock, s, influence, on, his, wife, s, artwork, is, often, discussed, by, art, historians, many, people, thought, that, krasner, began, to, reproduce, and, reinterpret, her, husband, s, chaotic, paint, splatters, in, her, own, work, there, are, several, accounts, where, krasner, intended, to, use, her, own, intuition, as, a, way, to, move, towards, pollock, s, i, am, nature, technique, in, order, to, reproduce, nature, in, her, art, in, 1955, pollock, painted, scent, and, search, his, last, two, paintings, he, did, not, paint, at, all, in, 1956, but, was, making, sculptures, at, tony, smith, s, home, constructions, of, wire, gauze, and, plaster, shaped, by, sand, casting, they, have, heavily, textured, surfaces, similar, to, what, pollock, often, created, in, his, paintings, pollock, and, krasner, s, relationship, began, to, crumble, by, 1956, owing, to, pollock, s, continuing, alcoholism, and, infidelity, involving, another, artist, ruth, kligman, on, august, 11, 1956, at, 10, 15, p, m, pollock, died, in, a, single, car, crash, in, his, oldsmobile, convertible, while, driving, under, the, influence, of, alcohol, at, the, time, krasner, was, visiting, friends, in, europe, she, abruptly, returned, on, hearing, the, news, from, a, friend, one, of, the, passengers, edith, metzger, was, also, killed, in, the, accident, which, occurred, less, than, a, mile, from, pollock, s, home, the, other, passenger, ruth, kligman, survived, in, december, 1956, four, months, after, his, death, pollock, was, given, a, memorial, retrospective, exhibition, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, moma, in, new, york, city, a, larger, more, comprehensive, exhibition, of, his, work, was, held, there, in, 1967, in, 1998, and, 1999, his, work, was, honored, with, large, scale, retrospective, exhibitions, at, moma, and, at, the, tate, in, london, for, the, rest, of, her, life, his, widow, lee, krasner, managed, his, estate, and, ensured, that, pollock, s, reputation, remained, strong, despite, changing, art, world, trends, the, couple, are, buried, in, green, river, cemetery, in, springs, with, a, large, boulder, marking, his, grave, and, a, smaller, one, marking, hers, the, work, of, thomas, hart, benton, pablo, picasso, and, joan, mir, influenced, pollock, pollock, started, using, synthetic, resin, based, paints, called, alkyd, enamels, which, at, that, time, was, a, novel, medium, pollock, described, this, use, of, household, paints, instead, of, artist, s, paints, as, a, natural, growth, out, of, a, need, he, used, hardened, brushes, sticks, and, even, basting, syringes, as, paint, applicators, pollock, s, technique, of, pouring, and, dripping, paint, is, thought, to, be, one, of, the, origins, of, the, term, action, painting, with, this, technique, pollock, was, able, to, achieve, his, own, signature, style, palimpsest, paintings, with, paints, flowing, from, his, chosen, tool, onto, the, canvas, by, defying, the, convention, of, painting, on, an, upright, surface, he, added, a, new, dimension, by, being, able, to, view, and, apply, paint, to, his, canvases, from, all, directions, in, 1936, pollock, participated, in, an, experimental, workshop, run, by, the, mexican, muralist, david, alfaro, siqueiros, it, was, there, that, he, first, used, liquid, enamel, paints, which, he, continued, to, incorporate, in, his, paintings, in, the, early, to, mid, 1940s, long, before, he, encountered, the, work, of, the, ukrainian, american, artist, janet, sobel, 1894, 1968, born, jennie, lechovsky, peggy, guggenheim, included, sobel, s, work, in, her, the, art, of, this, century, gallery, in, 1945, jackson, pollock, and, art, critic, clement, greenberg, saw, sobel, s, work, there, in, 1946, and, later, greenberg, noted, that, sobel, was, a, direct, influence, on, jackson, pollock, s, drip, painting, technique, in, his, essay, american, type, painting, greenberg, noted, those, works, were, the, first, of, all, over, painting, he, had, seen, and, said, pollock, admitted, that, these, pictures, had, made, an, impression, on, him, while, painting, this, way, pollock, moved, away, from, figurative, representation, and, challenged, the, western, tradition, of, using, easel, and, brush, he, used, the, force, of, his, whole, body, to, paint, which, was, expressed, on, the, large, canvases, in, 1956, time, magazine, dubbed, pollock, jack, the, dripper, due, to, his, painting, style, my, painting, does, not, come, from, the, easel, i, prefer, to, tack, the, unstretched, canvas, to, the, hard, wall, or, the, floor, i, need, the, resistance, of, a, hard, surface, on, the, floor, i, am, more, at, ease, i, feel, nearer, more, part, of, the, painting, since, this, way, i, can, walk, around, it, work, from, the, four, sides, and, literally, be, in, the, painting, i, continue, to, get, further, away, from, the, usual, painter, s, tools, such, as, easel, palette, brushes, etc, i, prefer, sticks, trowels, knives, and, dripping, fluid, paint, or, a, heavy, impasto, with, sand, broken, glass, or, other, foreign, matter, added, when, i, am, in, my, painting, i, m, not, aware, of, what, i, m, doing, it, is, only, after, a, sort, of, get, acquainted, period, that, i, see, what, i, have, been, about, i, have, no, fear, of, making, changes, destroying, the, image, etc, because, the, painting, has, a, life, of, its, own, i, try, to, let, it, come, through, it, is, only, when, i, lose, contact, with, the, painting, that, the, result, is, a, mess, otherwise, there, is, pure, harmony, an, easy, give, and, take, and, the, painting, comes, out, well, pollock, observed, native, american, sandpainting, demonstrations, in, the, 1940s, referring, to, his, style, of, painting, on, the, floor, pollock, stated, i, feel, nearer, more, a, part, of, the, painting, since, this, way, i, can, walk, round, it, work, from, the, four, sides, and, literally, be, in, the, painting, this, is, akin, to, the, methods, of, the, indian, sand, painters, of, the, west, other, influences, on, his, drip, technique, include, the, mexican, muralists, and, surrealist, automatism, pollock, denied, reliance, on, the, accident, he, usually, had, an, idea, of, how, he, wanted, a, particular, work, to, appear, his, technique, combined, the, movement, of, his, body, over, which, he, had, control, the, viscous, flow, of, paint, the, force, of, gravity, and, the, absorption, of, paint, into, the, canvas, it, was, a, mixture, of, controllable, and, uncontrollable, factors, flinging, dripping, pouring, and, spattering, he, would, move, energetically, around, the, canvas, almost, as, if, in, a, dance, and, would, not, stop, until, he, saw, what, he, wanted, to, see, austrian, artist, wolfgang, paalen, s, article, on, totem, art, of, the, indigenous, people, of, british, columbia, in, which, the, concept, of, space, in, totemist, art, is, considered, from, an, artist, s, point, of, view, influenced, pollock, as, well, pollock, owned, a, signed, and, dedicated, copy, of, the, amerindian, number, of, paalen, s, magazine, dyn, 4, 5, 1943, he, had, also, seen, paalen, s, surrealist, paintings, in, an, exhibition, in, 1940, another, strong, influence, must, have, been, paalen, s, surrealist, fumage, technique, which, appealed, to, painters, looking, for, new, ways, to, depict, what, was, called, the, unseen, or, the, possible, the, technique, was, once, demonstrated, in, matta, s, workshop, about, which, steven, naifeh, reports, once, when, matta, was, demonstrating, the, surrealist, technique, fumage, jackson, turned, to, peter, busa, and, said, in, a, stage, whisper, i, can, do, that, without, the, smoke, pollock, s, painter, friend, fritz, bultman, even, stated, it, was, wolfgang, paalen, who, started, it, all, in, 1950, hans, namuth, a, young, photographer, wanted, to, take, pictures, both, stills, and, moving, of, pollock, at, work, pollock, promised, to, start, a, new, painting, especially, for, the, photographic, session, but, when, namuth, arrived, pollock, apologized, and, told, him, the, painting, was, finished, namuth, said, that, when, he, entered, the, studio, a, dripping, wet, canvas, covered, the, entire, floor, there, was, complete, silence, pollock, looked, at, the, painting, then, unexpectedly, he, picked, up, can, and, paint, brush, and, started, to, move, around, the, canvas, it, was, as, if, he, suddenly, realized, the, painting, was, not, finished, his, movements, slow, at, first, gradually, became, faster, and, more, dance, like, as, he, flung, black, white, and, rust, colored, paint, onto, the, canvas, he, completely, forgot, that, lee, and, i, were, there, he, did, not, seem, to, hear, the, click, of, the, camera, shutter, my, photography, session, lasted, as, long, as, he, kept, painting, perhaps, half, an, hour, in, all, that, time, pollock, did, not, stop, how, could, one, keep, up, this, level, of, activity, finally, he, said, this, is, it, pollock, s, finest, paintings, reveal, that, his, all, over, line, does, not, give, rise, to, positive, or, negative, areas, we, are, not, made, to, feel, that, one, part, of, the, canvas, demands, to, be, read, as, figure, whether, abstract, or, representational, against, another, part, of, the, canvas, read, as, ground, there, is, not, inside, or, outside, to, pollock, s, line, or, the, space, through, which, it, moves, pollock, has, managed, to, free, line, not, only, from, its, function, of, representing, objects, in, the, world, but, also, from, its, task, of, describing, or, bounding, shapes, or, figures, whether, abstract, or, representational, on, the, surface, of, the, canvas, continuing, to, evade, the, viewer, s, search, for, figurative, elements, in, his, paintings, pollock, abandoned, titles, and, started, numbering, his, works, he, said, about, this, ook, passively, and, try, to, receive, what, the, painting, has, to, offer, and, not, bring, a, subject, matter, or, preconceived, idea, of, what, they, are, to, be, looking, for, his, wife, said, he, used, to, give, his, pictures, conventional, titles, but, now, he, simply, numbers, them, numbers, are, neutral, they, make, people, look, at, a, picture, for, what, it, is, pure, painting, pollock, s, work, has, been, the, subject, of, important, critical, debates, critic, robert, coates, once, derided, a, number, of, pollock, s, works, as, mere, unorganized, explosions, of, random, energy, and, therefore, meaningless, reynold, s, news, in, a, 1959, headline, said, this, is, not, art, it, s, a, joke, in, bad, taste, french, abstract, painter, jean, h, lion, on, the, other, hand, remarked, on, first, seeing, a, pollock, it, filled, out, space, going, on, and, on, because, it, did, not, have, a, start, or, end, to, it, clement, greenberg, supported, pollock, s, work, on, formalistic, grounds, it, fit, well, with, greenberg, s, view, of, art, history, as, a, progressive, purification, in, form, and, elimination, of, historical, content, he, considered, pollock, s, work, to, be, the, best, painting, of, its, day, and, the, culmination, of, the, western, tradition, via, cubism, and, c, zanne, to, manet, in, a, 1952, article, in, artnews, harold, rosenberg, coined, the, term, action, painting, and, wrote, that, what, was, to, go, on, the, canvas, was, not, a, picture, but, an, event, the, big, moment, came, when, it, was, decided, to, paint, just, to, paint, the, gesture, on, the, canvas, was, a, gesture, of, liberation, from, value, political, aesthetic, moral, many, people, assumed, that, he, had, modeled, his, action, painter, paradigm, on, pollock, the, congress, for, cultural, freedom, an, organization, to, promote, american, culture, and, values, backed, by, the, central, intelligence, agency, cia, sponsored, exhibitions, of, pollock, s, work, some, left, wing, scholars, including, eva, cockcroft, have, argued, that, the, united, states, government, and, wealthy, elite, embraced, pollock, and, abstract, expressionism, to, place, the, united, states, in, the, forefront, of, global, art, and, devalue, socialist, realism, cockcroft, wrote, that, pollock, became, a, weapon, of, the, cold, war, pollock, described, his, art, as, motion, made, visible, memories, arrested, in, space, pollock, s, staining, into, raw, canvas, was, adapted, by, the, color, field, painters, helen, frankenthaler, and, morris, louis, frank, stella, made, all, over, composition, a, hallmark, of, his, works, of, the, 1960s, joseph, glasco, was, introduced, to, pollock, by, alfonso, ossorio, in, 1949, throughout, his, life, glasco, continued, to, reflect, on, pollock, s, artistic, influence, particularly, in, the, early, to, mid, 1970s, when, his, style, changed, to, all, over, collage, paintings, with, their, emphasis, on, rhythm, and, process, the, happenings, artist, allan, kaprow, sculptors, richard, serra, and, eva, hesse, and, many, contemporary, artists, have, retained, pollock, s, emphasis, on, the, process, of, creation, they, were, influenced, by, his, approach, to, the, process, rather, than, the, look, of, his, work, in, 2004, one, number, 31, 1950, was, ranked, the, eighth, most, influential, piece, of, modern, art, in, a, poll, of, 500, artists, curators, critics, and, dealers, in, the, early, 1990s, three, groups, of, movie, makers, were, developing, pollock, biographical, projects, each, based, on, a, different, source, the, project, that, at, first, seemed, most, advanced, was, a, joint, venture, between, barbra, streisand, s, barwood, films, and, robert, de, niro, s, tribeca, productions, de, niro, s, parents, were, friends, of, krasner, and, pollock,

about, 1970, the, suit, was, settled, in, a, confidential, agreement, in, 2012, in, 1999, the, physicist, and, artist, richard, taylor, used, computer, analysis, to, show, similarities, between, pollock, s, painted, patterns, and, fractals, patterns, that, recur, on, multiple, size, scales, found, in, natural, scenery, reflecting, pollock, s, own, words, i, am, nature, his, research, team, labelled, pollock, s, style, fractal, expressionism, in, 2003, 24, pollockesque, paintings, and, drawings, were, found, in, a, locker, in, wainscott, new, york, in, 2005, the, pollock, krasner, foundation, requested, a, fractal, analysis, to, be, used, for, the, first, time, in, an, authenticity, dispute, researchers, at, the, university, of, oregon, used, the, technique, to, identify, differences, between, the, patterns, in, the, six, disputed, paintings, analyzed, and, those, in, 14, established, pollocks, pigment, analysis, of, the, paintings, by, researchers, at, harvard, university, showed, the, presence, in, one, painting, of, a, synthetic, pigment, that, was, not, patented, until, the, 1980s, and, materials, in, two, others, that, were, not, available, in, pollock, s, lifetime, in, 2007, a, traveling, museum, exhibition, of, the, paintings, was, mounted, and, was, accompanied, by, a, comprehensive, book, pollock, matters, written, by, ellen, g, landau, one, of,

their, proper, historic, context, landau, also, presents, the, forensic, findings, of, harvard, university, and, presents, possible, explanations, for, the, forensic, inconsistencies, that, were, found, in, three, of, the, 24, paintings, however, the, scientist, who, invented, one, of, the, modern, pigments, dismissed, the, possibility, that, pollock, used, this, paint, as, being, unlikely, to, the, point, of, fantasy, subsequently, over, 10, scientific, groups, have, performed, fractal, analysis, on, over, 50, of, pollock, s, works, a, 2015, study, that, used, fractal, analysis, as, one, of, its, techniques, achieved, a, 93, success, rate, distinguishing, real, from, fake, pollocks, current, research, of, fractal, expressionism, focuses, on, human, response, to, viewing, fractals, cognitive, neuroscientists, have, shown, that, pollock, s, fractals, induce, the, same, stress, reduction, in, observers, as, computer, generated, fractals, and, naturally, occurring,
