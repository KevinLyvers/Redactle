the, constantinople, conference, were, surprised, by, the, promulgation, of, a, constitution, but, european, powers, at, the, conference, rejected, the, constitution, as, a, too, radical, change, they, preferred, the, 1856, constitution, isl, hat, hatt, h, m, y, nu, or, the, 1839, g, lhane, edict, hatt, erif, and, questioned, whether, a, parliament, was, necessary, to, act, as, an, official, voice, of, the, people, in, any, event, like, many, other, would, be, reforms, of, the, ottoman, empire, it, proved, nearly, impossible, russia, continued, to, mobilize, for, war, and, early, in, 1877, the, ottoman, empire, went, to, war, with, the, russian, empire, abdul, hamid, s, biggest, fear, near, dissolution, was, realized, with, the, russian, declaration, of, war, on, 24, april, 1877, in, that, conflict, the, ottoman, empire, fought, without, help, from, european, allies, russian, chancellor, prince, gorchakov, had, by, that, time, effectively, purchased, austrian, neutrality, with, the, reichstadt, agreement, the, british, empire, though, still, fearing, the, russian, threat, to, the, british, presence, in, india, did, not, involve, itself, in, the, conflict, because, of,

hamid, ruled, the, ottoman, empire, from, y, ld, z, palace, as, russia, could, dominate, the, newly, independent, states, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, greatly, increased, its, influence, in, southeastern, europe, at, the, great, powers, insistence, especially, the, united, kingdom, s, the, treaty, was, revised, at, the, congress, of, berlin, so, as, to, reduce, the, great, advantages, russia, gained, in, exchange, for, these, favors, cyprus, was, ceded, to, britain, in, 1878, there, were, troubles, in, egypt, where, a, discredited, khedive, had, to, be, deposed, abdul, hamid,

provinces, cyprus, egypt, and, sudan, ostensibly, remained, ottoman, provinces, until, 1914, when, britain, officially, annexed, them, in, response, to, the, ottoman, participation, in, world, war, i, on, the, side, of, the, central, powers, abdul, hamid, s, distrust, of, the, reformist, admirals, of, the, ottoman, navy, whom, he, suspected, of, plotting, against, him, and, trying, to, restore, the, constitution, and, his, subsequent, decision, to, lock, the, ottoman, fleet, the, world, s, third, largest, fleet, during, the, reign, of, his, predecessor, abdul, aziz, inside, the, golden, horn, indirectly, caused, the, loss, of, ottoman, overseas, territories, and, islands, in, north, africa, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, aegean, sea, during, and, after, his, reign, financial, difficulties, forced, him, to, consent, to, foreign, control, over, the, ottoman, national, debt, in, a, decree, issued, in, december, 1881, a, large, portion, of, the, empire, s, revenues, were, handed, over, to, the, public, debt, administration, for, the, benefit, of, mostly, foreign, bondholders, see, kararname, of, 1296, the, 1885, union, of, bulgaria, with, eastern, rumelia, was, another, blow, to, the, empire, the, creation, of, an, independent, and, powerful, bulgaria, was, viewed, as, a, serious, threat, to, the, empire, for, many, years, abdul, hamid, had, to, deal, with, bulgaria, in, a, way, that, did, not, antagonize, the, russians, or, the, germans, there, were, also, key, problems, regarding, the, albanian, question, resulting, from, the, albanian, league, of, prizren, and, with, the, greek, and, montenegrin, frontiers, where, the, european, powers, were, determined, that, the, berlin, congress, s, decisions, be, carried, out, crete, was, granted, extended, privileges, but, these, did, not, satisfy, the, population, which, sought, unification, with, greece, in, early, 1897, a, greek, expedition, sailed, to, crete, to, overthrow, ottoman, rule, on, the, island, this, act, was, followed, by, the, greco, turkish, war, in, which, the, ottoman, empire, defeated, greece, but, as, a, result, of, the, treaty, of, constantinople, crete, was, taken, over, en, depot, by, the, united, kingdom, france, and, russia, prince, george, of, greece, was, appointed, ruler, and, crete, was, effectively, lost, to, the, ottoman, empire, the, ammiyya, a, revolt, in, 1889, 90, among, druze, and, other, syrians, against, excesses, of, the, local, sheikhs, similarly, led, to, capitulation, to, the, rebels, demands, as, well, as, concessions, to, belgian, and, french, companies, to, provide, a, railroad, between, beirut, and, damascus, most, people, expected, abdul, hamid, ii, to, have, liberal, ideas, and, some, conservatives, were, inclined, to, regard, him, with, suspicion, as, a, dangerous, reformer, despite, working, with, the, reformist, young, ottomans, while, still, crown, prince, and, appearing, to, be, a, liberal, leader, he, became, increasingly, conservative, after, taking, the, throne, in, a, process, known, as, stibdad, abdul, hamid, reduced, his, ministers, to, acting, as, secretaries, and, concentrated, much, of, the, empire, s, administration, into, his, own, hands, default, in, the, public, funds, an, empty, treasury, the, 1875, insurrection, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, the, war, with, serbia, and, montenegro, the, result, of, russo, turkish, war, and, the, feeling, aroused, throughout, europe, by, abdul, hamid, s, government, in, stamping, out, the, bulgarian, rebellion, all, contributed, to, his, apprehension, regarding, enacting, significant, changes, his, push, for, education, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, 18, professional, schools, and, in, 1900, dar, lf, n, n, u, ah, ne, now, known, as, istanbul, university, was, established, he, also, created, a, large, system, of, primary, secondary, and, military, schools, throughout, the, empire, 51, secondary, schools, were, constructed, in, a, 12, year, period, 1882, 1894, as, the, goal, of, the, educational, reforms, in, the, hamidian, era, were, to, counter, foreign, influence, these, secondary, schools, used, european, teaching, techniques, while, instilling, in, students, a, strong, sense, of, ottoman, identity, and, islamic, morality, abdul, hamid, also, reorganized, the, ministry, of, justice, and, developed, rail, and, telegraph, systems, the, telegraph, system, was, expanded, to, incorporate, the, furthest, parts, of, the, empire, railways, connected, constantinople, and, vienna, by, 1883, and, shortly, afterward, the, orient, express, connected, paris, to, constantinople, during, his, rule, railways, within, the, ottoman, empire, expanded, to, connect, ottoman, controlled, europe, and, anatolia, with, constantinople, as, well, the, increased, ability, to, travel, and, communicate, within, the, ottoman, empire, served, to, strengthen, constantinople, s, influence, over, the, rest, of, the, empire, abdul, hamid, introduced, legislation, against, the, slave, trade, via, the, anglo, ottoman, convention, of, 1880, and, the, kanunname, of, 1889, abdul, hamid, took, stringent, measures, regarding, his, security, the, memory, of, the, deposition, of, abdul, aziz, was, on, his, mind, and, convinced, him, that, a, constitutional, government, was, not, a, good, idea, because, of, this, information, was, tightly, controlled, and, the, press, rigidly, censored, a, secret, police, umur, u, hafiye, and, a, network, of, informants, was, present, throughout, the, empire, and, many, leading, figures, of, the, second, constitutional, era, and, ottoman, successor, states, were, arrested, or, exiled, school, curricula, were, closely, inspected, to, prevent, dissidence, ironically, the, schools, that, abdul, hamid, founded, and, tried, to, control, became, breeding, grounds, of, discontent, as, students, and, teachers, alike, chafed, at, the, censors, clumsy, restrictions, starting, around, 1890, armenians, began, demanding, implementation, of, the, reforms, promised, to, them, at, the, berlin, conference, to, prevent, such, measures, in, 1890, 91, abdul, hamid, gave, semi, official, status, to, the, bandits, who, were, already, actively, mistreating, the, armenians, in, the, provinces, made, up, of, kurds, and, other, ethnic, groups, such, as, turcomans, and, armed, by, the, state, they, came, to, be, called, the, hamidiye, alaylar, hamidian, regiments, the, hamidiye, and, kurdish, brigands, were, given, free, rein, to, attack, armenians, confiscating, stores, of, grain, foodstuffs, and, driving, off, livestock, confident, of, escaping, punishment, as, they, were, subject, only, to, court, martial, in, the, face, of, such, violence, the, armenians, established, revolutionary, organizations, the, social, democrat, hunchakian, party, hunchak, founded, in, switzerland, in, 1887, and, the, armenian, revolutionary, federation, the, arf, or, dashnaktsutiun, founded, in, 1890, in, tiflis, unrest, ensued, and, clashes, occurred, in, 1892, at, merzifon, and, in, 1893, at, tokat, abdul, hamid, put, these, revolts, down, with, harsh, methods, as, a, result, 300, 000, armenians, were, killed, in, what, became, known, as, the, hamidian, massacres, news, of, the, massacres, was, widely, reported, in, europe, and, the, united, states, and, drew, strong, responses, from, foreign, governments, and, humanitarian, organizations, abdul, hamid, was, called, the, bloody, sultan, or, red, sultan, in, the, west, on, 21, july, 1905, the, armenian, revolutionary, federation, attempted, to, assassinate, him, with, a, car, bomb, during, a, public, appearance, but, he, was, delayed, for, a, minute, and, the, bomb, went, off, too, early, killing, 26, wounding, 58, four, of, whom, died, during, their, treatment, in, hospital, and, destroying, 17, cars, this, continued, aggression, along, with, the, handling, of, the, armenian, desire, for, reform, led, western, european, powers, to, take, a, more, hands, on, approach, with, the, turks, abdul, hamid, survived, an, attempted, stabbing, in, 1904, as, well, abdul, hamid, did, not, believe, that, the, tanzimat, movement, could, succeed, in, helping, the, disparate, peoples, of, the, empire, achieve, a, common, identity, such, as, ottomanism, he, adopted, a, new, ideological, principle, pan, islamism, since, beginning, in, 1517, ottoman, sultans, were, also, nominally, caliphs, he, wanted, to, promote, that, fact, and, emphasized, the, ottoman, caliphate, given, the, great, diversity, of, ethnicities, in, the, ottoman, empire, he, believed, that, islam, was, the, only, way, to, unite, his, people, pan, islamism, encouraged, muslims, living, under, european, powers, to, unite, under, one, polity, this, threatened, several, european, countries, austria, through, bosnian, muslims, russia, through, tatars, and, kurds, france, and, spain, through, moroccan, muslims, and, britain, through, indian, muslims, foreigners, privileges, in, the, ottoman, empire, which, were, an, obstacle, to, effective, government, were, curtailed, at, the, very, end, of, his, reign, abdul, hamid, finally, provided, funds, to, start, construction, of, the, strategically, important, constantinople, baghdad, railway, and, the, constantinople, medina, railway, which, would, ease, the, trip, to, mecca, for, the, hajj, after, he, was, deposed, the, cup, accelerated, and, completed, construction, of, both, railways, missionaries, were, sent, to, distant, countries, preaching, islam, and, the, caliph, s, supremacy, during, his, rule, abdul, hamid, refused, theodor, herzl, s, offers, to, pay, down, a, substantial, portion, of, the, ottoman, debt, 150, million, pounds, sterling, in, gold, in, exchange, for, a, charter, allowing, the, zionists, to, settle, in, palestine, he, is, famously, quoted, as, telling, herzl, s, emissary, as, long, as, i, am, alive, i, will, not, have, our, body, divided, only, our, corpse, they, can, divide, pan, islamism, was, a, considerable, success, after, the, greco, ottoman, war, many, muslims, celebrated, the, ottoman, victory, as, their, victory, uprisings, lockouts, and, objections, to, european, colonization, in, newspapers, were, reported, in, muslim, regions, after, the, war, but, abdul, hamid, s, appeals, to, muslim, sentiment, were, not, always, very, effective, due, to, widespread, disaffection, within, the, empire, in, mesopotamia, and, yemen, disturbance, was, endemic, nearer, home, a, semblance, of, loyalty, was, maintained, in, the, army, and, among, the, muslim, population, only, by, a, system, of, deflation, and, espionage, in, 1898, u, s, secretary, of, state, john, hay, asked, united, states, minister, to, the, ottoman, empire, oscar, straus, to, request, that, abdul, hamid, in, his, capacity, as, caliph, write, a, letter, to, the, sulu, muslims, a, moro, subgroup, of, the, sulu, sultanate, in, the, philippines, ordering, them, not, to, join, the, moro, rebellion, and, submit, to, american, suzerainty, and, american, military, rule, the, sultan, obliged, the, americans, and, wrote, the, letter, which, was, sent, to, mecca, whence, two, sulu, chiefs, brought, it, to, sulu, it, was, successful, since, the, sulu, mohammedans, refused, to, join, the, insurrectionists, and, had, placed, themselves, under, the, control, of, our, army, thereby, recognizing, american, sovereignty, despite, abdul, hamid, s, pan, islamic, ideology, he, had, readily, acceded, to, straus, s, request, for, help, in, telling, the, sulu, muslims, to, not, resist, america, since, he, felt, no, need, to, cause, hostilities, between, the, west, and, muslims, collaboration, between, the, american, military, and, sulu, sultanate, was, due, to, the, ottoman, sultan, persuading, the, sulu, sultan, john, p, finley, wrote, after, due, consideration, of, these, facts, the, sultan, as, caliph, caused, a, message, to, be, sent, to, the, mohammedans, of, the, philippine, islands, forbidding, them, to, enter, into, any, hostilities, against, the, americans, inasmuch, as, no, interference, with, their, religion, would, be, allowed, under, american, rule, as, the, moros, have, never, asked, more, than, that, it, is, not, surprising, that, they, refused, all, overtures, made, by, aguinaldo, s, agents, at, the, time, of, the, filipino, insurrection, president, mckinley, sent, a, personal, letter, of, thanks, to, mr, straus, for, the, excellent, work, he, had, done, and, said, its, accomplishment, had, saved, the, united, states, at, least, twenty, thousand, troops, in, the, field, president, mckinley, did, not, mention, the, ottoman, role, in, the, pacification, of, the, sulu, moros, in, his, address, to, the, first, session, of, the, fifty, sixth, congress, in, december, 1899, since, the, agreement, with, the, sultan, of, sulu, was, not, submitted, to, the, senate, until, 18, december, the, bates, treaty, which, the, americans, signed, with, the, moro, sulu, sultanate, and, which, guaranteed, the, sultanate, s, autonomy, in, its, internal, affairs, and, governance, was, then, violated, by, the, americans, who, then, invaded, moroland, causing, the, moro, rebellion, to, break, out, in, 1904, with, war, raging, between, the, americans, and, moro, muslims, and, atrocities, committed, against, moro, muslim, women, and, children, such, as, the, moro, crater, massacre, the, triple, entente, the, united, kingdom, france, and, russia, had, strained, relations, with, the, ottoman, empire, abdul, hamid, and, his, close, advisors, believed, the, empire, should, be, treated, as, an, equal, player, by, these, great, powers, in, the, sultan, s, view, the, ottoman, empire, was, a, european, empire, that, was, distinguished, by, having, more, muslims, than, christians, over, time, the, hostile, diplomatic, attitudes, of, france, the, occupation, of, tunisia, in, 1881, and, great, britain, the, 1882, establishment, of, de, facto, control, in, egypt, caused, abdul, hamid, to, gravitate, towards, germany, abdul, hamid, twice, hosted, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, in, istanbul, on, 21, october, 1889, and, on, 5, october, 1898, wilhelm, ii, later, visited, constantinople, a, third, time, on, 15, october, 1917, as, a, guest, of, mehmed, v, german, officers, such, as, baron, von, der, goltz, and, bodo, borries, von, ditfurth, were, employed, to, oversee, the, organization, of, the, ottoman, army, german, government, officials, were, brought, in, to, reorganize, the, ottoman, government, s, finances, the, german, emperor, was, also, rumored, to, have, counseled, abdul, hamid, in, his, controversial, decision, to, appoint, his, third, son, as, his, successor, germany, s, friendship, was, not, altruistic, it, had, to, be, fostered, by, railway, and, loan, concessions, in, 1899, a, significant, german, wish, the, construction, of, a, berlin, baghdad, railway, was, granted, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, also, requested, the, sultan, s, help, when, he, had, trouble, with, chinese, muslim, troops, during, the, boxer, rebellion, the, chinese, muslim,
