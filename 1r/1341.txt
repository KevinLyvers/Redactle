two, proposed, bills, sirleaf, added, we, like, ourselves, just, the, way, we, are, we, ve, got, certain, traditional, values, in, our, society, that, we, would, like, to, preserve, according, to, tiawan, gongloe, liberia, s, former, solicitor, general, if, she, tried, to, decriminalise, the, law, it, would, be, political, suicide, in, a, letter, to, the, guardian, sirleaf, s, press, secretary, challenged, the, portrayal, of, her, remarks, in, the, media, saying, that, there, currently, exists, no, law, referencing, homosexuality, in, liberia, and, as, such, the, president, could, not, be, defending, a, law, on, homosexuality, the, president, is, on, record, as, saying, that, any, law, brought, before, her, regarding, homosexuality, will, be, vetoed, this, statement, also, applies, to, an, initial, attempt, by, two, members, of, the, liberian, legislature, to, introduce, tougher, laws, targeting, homosexuality, the, letter, added, the, status, quo, in, liberia, has, been, one, of, tolerance, and, no, one, has, ever, been, prosecuted, under, that, law, and, went, on, to, hint, at, future, possible, liberalization, stating, that, the, president, thinks, that, with, the, unprecedented, freedom, of, speech, and, expression, liberia, enjoys, today, our, budding, democracy, will, be, strong, enough, to, accommodate, new, ideas, and, debate, both, their, value, and, liberia, s, laws, with, openness, respect, and, independence, the, guardian, published, a, correction, to, its, story, nobel, peace, prize, winner, defends, law, criminalising, homosexuality, in,

concerning, homosexuality, in, liberia, that, is, she, refuses, to, dismantle, the, existing, anti, sodomy, law, while, also, saying, she, will, refuse, to, sign, two, new, bills, that, would, toughen, laws, on, homosexuality, the, comments, letter, and, clarification, suggest, that, she, considered, the, status, quo, for, gay, rights, in, liberia, to, be, one, of, de, facto, tolerance, until, the, recent, controversy, and, did, not, support, decriminalization, of, homosexuality, but, also, refused, to, support, further, criminalisation, of, homosexual, acts, which, was, being, attempted, in, liberia, she, reaffirmed, this, view, during, an, interview, with, tony, blair, upon, her, election, to, office, sirleaf, made, her, first, foreign, trip, as, president, to, neighboring, ivory, coast, meeting, with, ivorian, president, laurent, gbagbo, in, an, attempt, to, repair, relations, between, the, two, countries, following, c, te, d, ivoire, s, support, of, the,
