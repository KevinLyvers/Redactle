joined, the, party, abu, bakr, wanted, to, know, whether, he, had, come, to, give, orders, or, to, convey, them, ali, said, that, he, had, not, come, to, replace, abu, bakr, as, amir, ul, hajj, and, that, his, only, mission, was, to, convey, a, special, message, to, the, people, on, behalf, of, muhammad, at, mecca, abu, bakr, presided, at, the, hajj, ceremony, and, ali, read, the, proclamation, on, behalf, of, muhammad, the, main, points, of, the, proclamation, were, from, the, day, this, proclamation, was, made, a, new, era, dawned, and, islam, alone, was, to, be, supreme, in, arabia, abu, bakr, led, one, military, expedition, the, expedition, of, abu, bakr, as, siddiq, which, took, place, in, najd, in, july, 628, third, month, 7ah, in, the, islamic, calendar, abu, bakr, led, a, large, company, in, nejd, on, the, order, of, muhammad, many, were, killed, and, taken, prisoner, the, sunni, hadith, collection, sunan, abu, dawud, mentions, the, event, in, 632, during, the, final, weeks, of, his, life, muhammad, ordered, an, expedition, into, syria, to, avenge, the, defeat, of, the, muslims, in, the, battle, of, mu, tah, some, years, previously, leading, the, campaign, was, usama, ibn, zayd, whose, father, muhammad, s, erstwhile, adopted, son, zayd, ibn, harithah, had, been, killed, in, the, earlier, conflict, no, more, than, twenty, years, old, inexperienced, and, untested, usama, s, appointment, was, controversial, becoming, especially, problematic, when, veterans, such, as, abu, bakr, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, and, sa, d, ibn, abi, waqqas, were, placed, under, his, command, nevertheless, the, expedition, was, dispatched, though, soon, after, setting, off, news, was, received, of, muhammad, s, death, forcing, the, army, to, return, to, medina, the, campaign, was, not, reengaged, until, after, abu, bakr, s, ascension, to, the, caliphate, at, which, point, he, chose, to, reaffirm, usama, s, command, which, ultimately, led, to, its, success, there, are, a, number, of, traditions, regarding, muhammad, s, final, days, which, have, been, used, to, reinforce, the, idea, of, the, great, friendship, and, trust, which, is, existed, between, him, and, abu, bakr, in, one, such, episode, as, muhammad, was, nearing, death, he, found, himself, unable, to, lead, prayers, as, he, usually, would, he, instructed, abu, bakr, to, take, his, place, ignoring, concerns, from, aisha, that, her, father, was, too, emotionally, delicate, for, the, role, abu, bakr, subsequently, took, up, the, position, and, when, muhammad, entered, the, prayer, hall, one, morning, during, fajr, prayers, abu, bakr, attempted, to, step, back, to, let, him, to, take, up, his, normal, place, and, lead, muhammad, however, allowed, him, to, continue, in, a, related, incident, around, this, time, muhammad, ascended, the, pulpit, and, addressed, the, congregation, saying, god, has, given, his, servant, the, choice, between, this, world, and, that, which, is, with, god, and, he, has, chosen, the, latter, abu, bakr, understanding, this, to, mean, that, muhammad, did, not, have, long, to, live, responded, nay, we, and, our, children, will, be, your, ransom, muhammad, consoled, his, friend, and, ordered, that, all, the, doors, leading, to, the, mosque, be, closed, aside, from, that, which, led, from, abu, bakr, s, house, for, i, know, no, one, who, is, a, better, friend, to, me, than, he, upon, muhammad, s, death, the, muslim, community, was, unprepared, for, the, loss, of, its, leader, and, many, experienced, a, profound, shock, umar, was, particularly, affected, instead, declaring, that, muhammad, had, gone, to, consult, with, god, and, would, soon, return, threatening, anyone, who, would, say, that, muhammad, was, dead, abu, bakr, having, returned, to, medina, calmed, umar, by, showing, him, muhammad, s, body, convincing, him, of, his, death, he, then, addressed, those, who, had, gathered, at, the, mosque, saying, if, anyone, worships, muhammad, muhammad, is, dead, if, anyone, worships, god, god, is, alive, immortal, thus, putting, an, end, to, any, idolising, impulse, in, the, population, he, then, concluded, with, verses, from, the, quran, o, muhammad, verily, you, will, die, and, they, also, will, die, 39, 30, muhammad, is, no, more, than, an, apostle, and, indeed, many, apostles, have, passed, away, before, him, if, he, dies, or, is, killed, will, you, then, turn, back, on, your, heels, and, he, who, turns, back, on, his, heels, not, the, least, harm, will, he, do, to, allah, and, allah, will, give, reward, to, those, who, are, grateful, 3, 144, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, muhammad, s, death, a, gathering, of, the, ansar, took, place, in, the, saqifa, courtyard, of, the, banu, sa, ida, clan, the, general, belief, at, the, time, was, that, the, purpose, of, the, meeting, was, for, the, ansar, to, decide, on, a, new, leader, of, the, muslim, community, among, themselves, with, the, intentional, exclusion, of, the, muhajirun, migrants, from, mecca, though, this, has, later, become, the, subject, of, debate, nevertheless, abu, bakr, and, umar, upon, learning, of, the, meeting, became, concerned, of, a, potential, coup, and, hastened, to, the, gathering, upon, arriving, abu, bakr, addressed, the, assembled, men, with, a, warning, that, an, attempt, to, elect, a, leader, outside, of, muhammad, s, own, tribe, the, quraysh, would, likely, result, in, dissension, as, only, they, can, command, the, necessary, respect, among, the, community, he, then, took, umar, and, abu, ubaidah, by, the, hand, and, offered, them, to, the, ansar, as, potential, choices, habab, ibn, mundhir, a, veteran, from, the, battle, of, badr, countered, with, his, own, suggestion, that, the, quraysh, and, the, ansar, choose, a, leader, each, from, among, themselves, who, would, then, rule, jointly, the, group, grew, heated, upon, hearing, this, proposal, and, began, to, argue, amongst, themselves, the, orientalist, william, muir, gives, the, following, observation, of, the, situation, the, moment, was, critical, the, unity, of, the, faith, was, at, stake, a, divided, power, would, fall, to, pieces, and, all, might, be, lost, the, mantle, of, the, prophet, must, fall, upon, one, successor, and, on, one, alone, the, sovereignty, of, islam, demanded, an, undivided, caliphate, and, arabia, would, acknowledge, no, master, but, from, amongst, koreish, umar, hastily, took, abu, bakr, s, hand, and, swore, his, own, allegiance, to, the, latter, an, example, followed, by, the, gathered, men, the, meeting, broke, up, when, a, violent, scuffle, erupted, between, umar, and, the, chief, of, the, banu, sa, ida, sa, d, ibn, ubadah, this, event, suggests, that, the, choice, of, abu, bakr, was, not, unanimous, with, emotions, running, high, as, a, result, of, the, disagreement, abu, bakr, was, near, universally, accepted, as, head, of, the, muslim, community, under, the, title, of, caliph, as, a, result, of, saqifah, though, he, did, face, contention, because, of, the, rushed, nature, of, the, event, several, companions, most, prominent, among, them, being, ali, ibn, abi, talib, initially, refused, to, acknowledge, his, authority, among, shi, ites, it, is, also, argued, that, ali, had, previously, been, appointed, as, muhammad, s, heir, with, the, election, being, seen, as, in, contravention, to, the, latter, s, wishes, abu, bakr, later, sent, umar, to, confront, ali, resulting, in, an, altercation, which, may, have, involved, violence, however, after, six, months, the, group, made, peace, with, abu, bakr, and, ali, offered, him, his, allegiance, after, assuming, the, office, of, caliph, abu, bakr, s, first, address, was, as, follows, i, have, been, given, the, authority, over, you, and, i, am, not, the, best, of, you, if, i, do, well, help, me, and, if, i, do, wrong, set, me, right, sincere, regard, for, truth, is, loyalty, and, disregard, for, truth, is, treachery, the, weak, amongst, you, shall, be, strong, with, me, until, i, have, secured, his, rights, if, god, wills, and, the, strong, amongst, you, shall, be, weak, with, me, until, i, have, wrested, from, him, the, rights, of, others, if, god, wills, obey, me, so, long, as, i, obey, god, and, his, messenger, but, if, i, disobey, god, and, his, messenger, you, owe, me, no, obedience, arise, for, your, prayer, god, have, mercy, upon, you, al, bidaayah, wan, nihaayah, 6, 305, 306, abu, bakr, s, reign, lasted, for, 27, months, during, which, he, crushed, the, rebellion, of, the, arab, tribes, throughout, the, arabian, peninsula, in, the, successful, ridda, wars, in, the, last, months, of, his, rule, he, sent, khalid, ibn, al, walid, on, conquests, against, the, sassanid, empire, in, mesopotamia, and, against, the, byzantine, empire, in, syria, this, would, set, in, motion, a, historical, trajectory, continued, later, on, by, umar, and, uthman, ibn, affan, that, in, just, a, few, short, decades, would, lead, to, one, of, the, largest, empires, in, history, he, had, little, time, to, pay, attention, to, the, administration, of, state, though, state, affairs, remained, stable, during, his, caliphate, on, the, advice, of, umar, and, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, he, agreed, to, draw, a, salary, from, the, state, treasury, and, discontinue, his, cloth, trade, troubles, emerged, soon, after, abu, bakr, s, succession, with, several, arab, tribes, launching, revolts, threatening, the, unity, and, stability, of, the, new, community, and, state, these, insurgencies, and, the, caliphate, s, responses, to, them, are, collectively, referred, to, as, the, ridda, wars, wars, of, apostasy, the, opposition, movements, came, in, two, forms, one, type, challenged, the, political, power, of, the, nascent, caliphate, as, well, as, the, religious, authority, of, islam, with, the, acclamation, of, rival, ideologies, headed, by, political, leaders, who, claimed, the, mantle, of, prophethood, in, the, manner, that, muhammad, had, done, these, rebellions, include, these, leaders, are, all, denounced, in, islamic, histories, as, false, prophets, the, second, form, of, opposition, movement, was, more, strictly, political, in, character, some, of, the, revolts, of, this, type, took, the, form, of, tax, rebellions, in, najd, among, tribes, such, as, the, banu, fazara, and, banu, tamim, other, dissenters, while, initially, allied, to, the, muslims, used, muhammad, s, death, as, an, opportunity, to, attempt, to, restrict, the, growth, of, the, new, islamic, state, they, include, some, of, the, rab, a, in, bahrayn, the, azd, in, oman, as, well, as, among, the, kindah, and, khawlan, in, yemen, abu, bakr, likely, understanding, that, maintaining, firm, control, over, the, disparate, tribes, of, arabia, was, crucial, to, ensuring, the, survival, of, the, state, suppressed, the, insurrections, with, military, force, he, dispatched, khalid, ibn, walid, and, a, body, of, troops, to, subdue, the, uprisings, in, najd, as, well, as, that, of, musaylimah, who, posed, the, most, serious, threat, concurrent, to, this, shurahbil, ibn, hasana, and, al, ala, a, al, hadrami, were, sent, to, bahrayn, while, ikrimah, ibn, abi, jahl, hudhayfah, al, bariqi, and, arfaja, al, bariqi, were, instructed, to, conquer, oman, finally, al, muhajir, ibn, abi, umayya, and, khalid, ibn, asid, were, sent, to, yemen, to, aid, the, local, governor, in, re, establishing, control, abu, bakr, also, made, use, of, diplomatic, means, in, addition, to, military, measures, like, muhammad, before, him, he, used, marriage, alliances, and, financial, incentives, to, bind, former, enemies, to, the, caliphate, for, instance, a, member, of, the, banu, hanifa, who, had, sided, with, the, muslims, was, rewarded, with, the, granting, of, a, land, estate, similarly, a, kindah, rebel, named, al, ash, ath, ibn, qays, after, repenting, and, re, joining, islam, was, later, given, land, in, medina, as, well, as, the, hand, of, abu, bakr, s, sister, umm, farwa, in, marriage, at, their, heart, the, ridda, movements, were, challenges, to, the, political, and, religious, supremacy, of, the, islamic, state, through, his, success, in, suppressing, the, insurrections, abu, bakr, had, in, effect, continued, the, political, consolidation, which, had, begun, under, muhammad, s, leadership, with, relatively, little, interruption, by, wars, end, he, had, established, an, islamic, hegemony, over, the, entirety, of, the, arabian, peninsula, with, arabia, having, united, under, a, single, centralised, state, with, a, formidable, military, the, region, could, now, be, viewed, as, a, potential, threat, to, the, neighbouring, byzantine, and, sasanian, empires, it, may, be, that, abu, bakr, reasoning, that, it, was, inevitable, that, one, of, these, powers, would, launch, a, pre, emptive, strike, against, the, youthful, caliphate, decided, that, it, was, better, to, deliver, the, first, blow, himself, regardless, of, the, caliph, s, motivations, in, 633, small, forces, were, dispatched, into, iraq, and, palestine, capturing, several, towns, though, the, byzantines, and, sassanians, were, certain, to, retaliate, abu, bakr, had, reason, to, be, confident, the, two, empires, were, militarily, exhausted, after, centuries, of, war, against, each, other, making, it, likely, that, any, forces, sent, to, arabia, would, be, diminished, and, weakened, a, more, pressing, advantage, though, was, the, effectiveness, of, the, muslim, fighters, as, well, as, their, zeal, the, latter, of, which, was, partially, based, on, their, certainty, of, the, righteousness, of, their, cause, additionally, the, general, belief, among, the, muslims, was, that, the, community, must, be, defended, at, all, costs, historian, theodor, n, ldeke, gives, the, somewhat, controversial, opinion, that, this, religious, fervour, was, intentionally, used, to, maintain, the, enthusiasm, and, momentum, of, the, ummah, it, was, certainly, good, policy, to, turn, the, recently, subdued, tribes, of, the, wilderness, towards, an, external, aim, in, which, they, might, at, once, satisfy, their, lust, for, booty, on, a, grand, scale, maintain, their, warlike, feeling, and, strengthen, themselves, in, their, attachment, to, the, new, faith, muhammad, himself, had, already, sent, expeditions, across, the, frontier, and, thereby, had, pointed, out, the, way, to, his, successors, to, follow, in, his, footsteps, was, in, accordance, with, the, innermost, being, of, the, youthful, islam, already, grown, great, amid, the, tumult, of, arms, though, abu, bakr, had, started, these, initial, conflicts, which, eventually, resulted, in, the, islamic, conquests, of, persia, and, the, levant, he, did, not, live, to, see, those, regions, conquered, by, islam, instead, leaving, the, task, to, his, successors, abu, bakr, was, instrumental, in, preserving, the, quran, in, written, form, it, is, said, that, after, the, hard, won, victory, over, musaylimah, in, the, battle, of, yamama, in, 632, umar, saw, that, some, five, hundred, of, the, muslims, who, had, memorised, the, quran, had, been, killed, in, wars, fearing, that, it, might, become, lost, or, corrupted, umar, requested, that, abu, bakr, authorise, the, compilation, and, preservation, of, the, scriptures, in, written, format, the, caliph, was, initially, hesitant, being, quoted, as, saying, how, can, we, do, that, which, the, messenger, of, allah, may, allah, bless, and, keep, him, did, not, himself, do, he, eventually, relented, however, and, appointed, zayd, ibn, thabit, who, had, previously, served, as, one, of, the, scribes, of, muhammad, for, the, task, of, gathering, the, scattered, verses, the, fragments, were, recovered, from, every, quarter, including, from, the, ribs, of, palm, branches, scraps, of, leather, stone, tablets, and, from, the, hearts, of, men, the, collected, work, was, transcribed, onto, sheets, and, verified, through, comparison, with, quran, memorisers, the, finished, codex, termed, the, mus, haf, was, presented, to, abu, bakr, who, prior, to, his, death, bequeathed, it, to, his, successor, umar, upon, umar, s, own, death, the, mus, haf, was, left, to, his, daughter, hafsa, who, had, been, one, of, the, wives, of, muhammad, it, was, this, volume, borrowed, from, hafsa, which, formed, the, basis, of, uthman, s, legendary, prototype, which, became, the, definitive, text, of, the, quran, all, later, editions, are, derived, from, this, original, on, 23, august, 634, abu, bakr, fell, sick, and, did, not, recover, he, developed, a, high, fever, and, was, confined, to, bed, his, illness, was, prolonged, and, when, his, condition, worsened, he, felt, that, his, end, was, near, realising, this, he, sent, for, ali, and, requested, him, to, perform, his, ghusl, since, ali, had, also, done, it, for, muhammad, abu, bakr, felt, that, he, should, nominate, his, successor, so, that, the, issue, should, not, be, a, cause, of, dissension, among, the, muslims, after, his, death, though, there, was, already, controversy, over, ali, not, having, been, appointed, he, appointed, umar, for, this, role, after, discussing, the, matter, with, some, companions, some, of, them, favoured, the, nomination, and, others, disliked, it, due, to, the, tough, nature, of, umar, abu, bakr, thus, dictated, his, last, testament, to, uthman, ibn, affan, as, follows, in, the, name, of, most, merciful, god, this, is, the, last, will, and, testament, of, abu, bakr, bin, abu, quhafa, when, he, is, in, the, last, hour, of, the, world, and, the, first, of, the, next, an, hour, in, which, the, infidel, must, believe, the, wicked, be, convinced, of, their, evil, ways, i, nominate, umar, ibn, al, khattab, as, my, successor, therefore, hear, to, him, and, obey, him, if, he, acts, right, confirm, his, actions, my, intentions, are, good, but, i, cannot, see, the, future, results, however, those, who, do, ill, shall, render, themselves, liable, to, severe, account, hereafter, fare, you, well, may, you, be, ever, attended, by, the, divine, favor, of, blessing, umar, led, the, funeral, prayer, for, him, and, he, was, buried, beside, the, grave, of, muhammad, the, historian, al, tabari, in, regards, to, abu, bakr, s, appearance, records, the, following, interaction, between, aisha, and, her, paternal, nephew, abd, allah, ibn, abd, al, rahman, ibn, abi, bakr, when, she, was, in, her, howdah, and, saw, a, man, from, among, the, arabs, passing, by, she, said, i, have, not, seen, a, man, more, like, abu, bakr, than, this, one, we, said, to, her, describe, abu, bakr, she, said, a, slight, white, man, thin, bearded, and, bowed, his, waist, wrapper, would, not, hold, but, would, fall, down, around, his, loins, he, had, a, lean, face, sunken, eyes, a, bulging, forehead, and, trembling, knuckles, referencing, another, source, al, tabari, further, describes, him, as, being, white, mixed, with, yellowness, of, good, build, slight, bowed, thin, tall, like, a, male, palm, tree, hook, nosed, lean, faced, sunken, eyed, thin, shanked, and, strong, thighed, he, used, to, dye, himself, with, henna, and, black, dye, though, the, period, of, his, caliphate, covers, only, two, years, two, months, and, fifteen, days, it, included, successful, invasions, of, the, two, most, powerful, empires, of, the, time, the, sassanid, empire, and, byzantine, empire, he, is, known, as, al, siddiq, atiq, and, companion, of, the, cave, abu, bakr, had, the, distinction, of, being, the, first, caliph, in, the, history, of, islam, and, also, the, first, caliph, to, nominate, a, successor, he, was, the, only, caliph, in, the, history, of, islam, who, refunded, to, the, state, treasury, at, the, time, of, his, death, the, entire, amount, of, the, allowance, that, he, had, drawn, during, the, period, of, his, caliphate, he, has, the, distinction, of, purchasing, the, land, for, al, masjid, al, nabawi, sunni, muslim, tradition, considers, abu, bakr, the, best, men, after, the, prophets, in, sunni, islam, they, also, consider, abu, bakr, as, one, of, the, ten, promised, paradise, al, ashara, al, mubashshara, whom, muhammad, had, testified, were, destined, for, paradise, he, is, regarded, as, the, successor, of, allah, s, messenger, khalifa, rasulullah, and, first, of, the, rightly, guided, caliphs, i, e, rashidun, and, as, the, rightful, successor, to, muhammad, abu, bakr, had, always, been, the, closest, friend, and, confidant, of, muhammad, throughout, his, life, being, beside, muhammad, at, every, major, event, it, was, abu, bakr, s, wisdom, that, muhammad, always, honored, abu, bakr, is, regarded, among, the, best, of, muhammad, s, followers, as, umar, ibn, al, khattab, stated, if, the, faith, of, abu, bakr, was, weighed, against, the, faith, of, the, people, of, the, earth, the, faith, of, abu, bakr, would, outweigh, the, others, shia, muslims, believe, that, ali, ibn, abi, talib, was, supposed, to, assume, the, leadership, and, that, he, had, been, publicly, and, unambiguously, appointed, by, muhammad, as, his, successor, at, ghadir, khumm, it, is, also, believed, that, abu, bakr, and, umar, conspired, to, take, over, power, in, the, muslim, nation, after, muhammad, s, death, in, a, coup, d, tat, against, ali, most, twelver, shia, as, the, main, branch, of, shia, islam, with, 85, of, all, shias, have, a, negative, view, of, abu, bakr, because, after, muhammad, s, death, abu, bakr, refused, to, grant, muhammad, s, daughter, fatimah, the, lands, of, the, village, of, fadak, which, she, claimed, her, father, had, given, to, her, as, a, gift, before, his, death, he, refused, to, accept, the, testimony, of, her, witnesses, so, she, claimed, the, land, would, still, belong, to, her, as, inheritance, from, her, deceased, father, however, abu, bakr, replied, by, saying, that, muhammad, had, told, him, that, the, prophets, of, god, do, not, leave, as, inheritance, any, worldly, possessions, and, on, this, basis, he, refused, to, give, her, the, lands, of, fadak, however, as, sayed, ali, asgher, razwy, notes, in, his, book, a, restatement, of, the, history, of, islam, muslims, muhammad, inherited, a, maid, servant, five, camels, and, ten, sheep, shia, muslims, believe, that, prophets, can, receive, inheritance, and, can, pass, on, inheritance, to, others, as, well, in, addition, shias, claim, that, muhammad, had, given, fadak, to, fatimah, during, his, lifetime, and, fadak, was, therefore, a, gift, to, fatimah, not, inheritance, this, view, has, also, been, supported, by, the, abbasid, ruler, al, ma, mun, twelvers, also, accuse, abu, bakr, of, participating, in, the, burning, of, the, house, of, ali, and, fatima, the, twelver, shia, believe, that, abu, bakr, sent, khalid, ibn, walid, to, crush, those, who, were, in, favour, of, ali, s, caliphate, see, ridda, wars, the, twelver, shia, strongly, contest, the, idea, that, abu, bakr, or, umar, were, instrumental, in, the, collection, or, preservation, of, the, quran, claiming, that, they, should, have, accepted, the, copy, of, the, book, in, the, possession, of, ali, however, sunnis, argue, that, ali, and, abu, bakr, were, not, enemies, and, that, ali, named, his, sons, abi, bakr, in, honor, of, abu, bakr, after, the, death, of, abu, bakr, ali, raised, abu, bakr, s, son, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, the, twelver, shia, view, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, as, one, of, the, greatest, companions, of, ali, when, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, was, killed, by, the, umayyads, aisha, the, third, wife, of, muhammad, raised, and, taught, her, nephew, qasim, ibn, muhammad, ibn,
