companies, in, which, his, own, family, held, an, interest, within, a, few, years, his, paper, dominated, the, san, francisco, market, early, in, his, career, at, the, san, francisco, examiner, hearst, envisioned, running, a, large, newspaper, chain, and, always, knew, that, his, dream, of, a, nation, spanning, multi, paper, news, operation, was, impossible, without, a, triumph, in, new, york, in, 1895, with, the, financial, support, of, his, widowed, mother, his, father, had, died, in, 1891, hearst, bought, the, then, failing, new, york, morning, journal, hiring, writers, such, as, stephen, crane, and, julian, hawthorne, and, entering, into, a, head, to, head, circulation, war, with, joseph, pulitzer, owner, and, publisher, of, the, new, york, world, hearst, stole, cartoonist, richard, f, outcault, along, with, all, of, pulitzer, s, sunday, staff, another, prominent, hire, was, james, j, montague, who, came, from, the, portland, oregonian, and, started, his, well, known, more, truth, than, poetry, column, at, the, hearst, owned, new, york, evening, journal, when, hearst, purchased, the, penny, paper, so, called, because, its, copies, sold, for, a, penny, apiece, the, journal, was, competing, with, new, york, s, 16, other, major, dailies, it, had, a, strong, focus, on, democratic, party, politics, hearst, imported, his, best, managers, from, the, san, francisco, examiner, and, quickly, established, himself, as, the, most, attractive, employer, among, new, york, newspapers, he, was, seen, as, generous, paid, more, than, his, competitors, and, gave, credit, to, his, writers, with, page, one, bylines, further, he, was, unfailingly, polite, unassuming, impeccably, calm, and, indulgent, of, prima, donnas, eccentrics, bohemians, drunks, or, reprobates, so, long, as, they, had, useful, talents, according, to, historian, kenneth, whyte, hearst, s, activist, approach, to, journalism, can, be, summarized, by, the, motto, while, others, talk, the, journal, acts, the, new, york, journal, and, its, chief, rival, the, new, york, world, mastered, a, style, of, popular, journalism, that, came, to, be, derided, as, yellow, journalism, so, named, after, outcault, s, yellow, kid, comic, pulitzer, s, world, had, pushed, the, boundaries, of, mass, appeal, for, newspapers, through, bold, headlines, aggressive, news, gathering, generous, use, of, cartoons, and, illustrations, populist, politics, progressive, crusades, an, exuberant, public, spirit, and, dramatic, crime, and, human, interest, stories, hearst, s, journal, used, the, same, recipe, for, success, forcing, pulitzer, to, drop, the, price, of, the, world, from, two, cents, to, a, penny, soon, the, two, papers, were, locked, in, a, fierce, often, spiteful, competition, for, readers, in, which, both, papers, spent, large, sums, of, money, and, saw, huge, gains, in, circulation, within, a, few, months, of, purchasing, the, journal, hearst, hired, away, pulitzer, s, three, top, editors, sunday, editor, morrill, goddard, who, greatly, expanded, the, scope, and, appeal, of, the, american, sunday, newspaper, solomon, carvalho, and, a, young, arthur, brisbane, who, became, managing, editor, of, the, hearst, newspaper, empire, and, a, well, known, columnist, contrary, to, popular, assumption, they, were, not, lured, away, by, higher, pay, rather, each, man, had, grown, tired, of, the, office, environment, that, pulitzer, encouraged, while, hearst, s, many, critics, attribute, the, journal, s, incredible, success, to, cheap, sensationalism, kenneth, whyte, noted, in, the, uncrowned, king, the, sensational, rise, of, william, randolph, hearst, rather, than, racing, to, the, bottom, he, drove, the, journal, and, the, penny, press, upmarket, the, journal, was, a, demanding, sophisticated, paper, by, contemporary, standards, though, yellow, journalism, would, be, much, maligned, whyte, said, all, good, yellow, journalists, sought, the, human, in, every, story, and, edited, without, fear, of, emotion, or, drama, they, wore, their, feelings, on, their, pages, believing, it, was, an, honest, and, wholesome, way, to, communicate, with, readers, but, as, whyte, pointed, out, this, appeal, to, feelings, is, not, an, end, in, itself, our, emotions, tend, to, ignite, our, intellects, a, story, catering, to, a, reader, s, feelings, is, more, likely, than, a, dry, treatise, to, stimulate, thought, the, two, papers, finally, declared, a, truce, in, late, 1898, after, both, lost, vast, amounts, of, money, covering, the, spanish, american, war, hearst, probably, lost, several, million, dollars, in, his, first, three, years, as, publisher, of, the, journal, figures, are, impossible, to, verify, but, the, paper, began, turning, a, profit, after, it, ended, its, fight, with, the, world, under, hearst, the, journal, remained, loyal, to, the, populist, or, left, wing, of, the, democratic, party, it, was, the, only, major, publication, in, the, east, to, support, william, jennings, bryan, in, 1896, its, coverage, of, that, election, was, probably, the, most, important, of, any, newspaper, in, the, country, attacking, relentlessly, the, unprecedented, role, of, money, in, the, republican, campaign, and, the, dominating, role, played, by, william, mckinley, s, political, and, financial, manager, mark, hanna, the, first, national, party, boss, in, american, history, a, year, after, taking, over, the, paper, hearst, could, boast, that, sales, of, the, journal, s, post, election, issue, including, the, evening, and, german, language, editions, topped, 1, 5, million, a, record, unparalleled, in, the, history, of, the, world, the, journal, s, political, coverage, however, was, not, entirely, one, sided, kenneth, whyte, says, that, most, editors, of, the, time, believed, their, papers, should, speak, with, one, voice, on, political, matters, by, contrast, in, new, york, hearst, helped, to, usher, in, the, multi, perspective, approach, we, identify, with, the, modern, op, ed, page, at, first, he, supported, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, but, later, he, turned, against, it, hearst, fought, hard, against, wilsonian, internationalism, the, league, of, nations, and, the, world, court, thereby, appealing, to, an, isolationist, audience, the, morning, journal, s, daily, circulation, routinely, climbed, above, the, 1, million, mark, after, the, sinking, of, the, maine, and, u, s, entry, into, the, spanish, american, war, a, war, that, some, called, the, journal, s, war, due, to, the, paper, s, immense, influence, in, provoking, american, outrage, against, spain, much, of, the, coverage, leading, up, to, the, war, beginning, with, the, outbreak, of, the, cuban, revolution, in, 1895, was, tainted, by, rumor, propaganda, and, sensationalism, with, the, yellow, papers, regarded, as, the, worst, offenders, the, journal, and, other, new, york, newspapers, were, so, one, sided, and, full, of, errors, in, their, reporting, that, coverage, of, the, cuban, crisis, and, the, ensuing, spanish, american, war, is, often, cited, as, one, of, the, most, significant, milestones, in, the, rise, of, yellow, journalism, s, hold, over, the, mainstream, media, huge, headlines, in, the, journal, assigned, blame, for, the, maine, s, destruction, on, sabotage, which, was, based, on, no, evidence, this, reporting, stoked, outrage, and, indignation, against, spain, among, the, paper, s, readers, in, new, york, the, journal, s, crusade, against, spanish, rule, in, cuba, was, not, due, to, mere, jingoism, although, the, democratic, ideals, and, humanitarianism, that, inspired, their, coverage, are, largely, lost, to, history, as, are, their, heroic, efforts, to, find, the, truth, on, the, island, under, unusually, difficult, circumstances, the, journal, s, journalistic, activism, in, support, of, the, cuban, rebels, rather, was, centered, around, hearst, s, political, and, business, ambitions, perhaps, the, best, known, myth, in, american, journalism, is, the, claim, without, any, contemporary, evidence, that, the, illustrator, frederic, remington, sent, by, hearst, to, cuba, to, cover, the, cuban, war, of, independence, cabled, hearst, to, tell, him, all, was, quiet, in, cuba, hearst, in, this, canard, is, said, to, have, responded, please, remain, you, furnish, the, pictures, and, i, ll, furnish, the, war, hearst, was, personally, dedicated, to, the, cause, of, the, cuban, rebels, and, the, journal, did, some, of, the, most, important, and, courageous, reporting, on, the, conflict, as, well, as, some, of, the, most, sensationalized, their, stories, on, the, cuban, rebellion, and, spain, s, atrocities, on, the, island, many, of, which, turned, out, to, be, untrue, were, motivated, primarily, by, hearst, s, outrage, at, spain, s, brutal, policies, on, the, island, these, had, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, innocent, cubans, the, most, well, known, story, involved, the, imprisonment, and, escape, of, cuban, prisoner, evangelina, cisneros, while, hearst, and, the, yellow, press, did, not, directly, cause, america, s, war, with, spain, they, inflamed, public, opinion, in, new, york, city, to, a, fever, pitch, new, york, s, elites, read, other, papers, such, as, the, times, and, sun, which, were, far, more, restrained, the, journal, and, the, world, were, local, papers, oriented, to, a, very, large, working, class, audience, in, new, york, city, they, were, not, among, the, top, ten, sources, of, news, in, papers, in, other, cities, and, their, stories, did, not, make, a, splash, outside, new, york, city, outrage, across, the, country, came, from, evidence, of, what, spain, was, doing, in, cuba, a, major, influence, in, the, decision, by, congress, to, declare, war, according, to, a, 21st, century, historian, war, was, declared, by, congress, because, public, opinion, was, sickened, by, the, bloodshed, and, because, leaders, like, mckinley, realized, that, spain, had, lost, control, of, cuba, these, factors, weighed, more, on, the, president, s, mind, than, the, melodramas, in, the, new, york, journal, hearst, sailed, to, cuba, with, a, small, army, of, journal, reporters, to, cover, the, spanish, american, war, they, brought, along, portable, printing, equipment, which, was, used, to, print, a, single, edition, newspaper, in, cuba, after, the, fighting, had, ended, two, of, the, journal, s, correspondents, james, creelman, and, edward, marshall, were, wounded, in, the, fighting, a, leader, of, the, cuban, rebels, gen, calixto, garc, a, gave, hearst, a, cuban, flag, that, had, been, riddled, with, bullets, as, a, gift, in, appreciation, of, hearst, s, major, role, in, cuba, s, liberation, in, part, to, aid, in, his, political, ambitions, hearst, opened, newspapers, in, other, cities, among, them, chicago, los, angeles, and, boston, in, 1915, he, founded, international, film, service, an, animation, studio, designed, to, exploit, the, popularity, of, the, comic, strips, he, controlled, the, creation, of, his, chicago, paper, was, requested, by, the, democratic, national, committee, hearst, used, this, as, an, excuse, for, his, mother, phoebe, hearst, to, transfer, him, the, necessary, start, up, funds, by, the, mid, 1920s, he, had, a, nationwide, string, of, 28, newspapers, among, them, the, los, angeles, examiner, the, boston, american, the, atlanta, georgian, the, chicago, examiner, the, detroit, times, the, seattle, post, intelligencer, the, washington, times, herald, the, washington, herald, and, his, flagship, the, san, francisco, examiner, hearst, also, diversified, his, publishing, interests, into, book, publishing, and, magazines, several, of, the, latter, are, still, in, circulation, including, such, periodicals, as, cosmopolitan, good, housekeeping, town, and, country, and, harper, s, bazaar, in, 1924, hearst, opened, the, new, york, daily, mirror, a, racy, tabloid, frankly, imitating, the, new, york, daily, news, among, his, other, holdings, were, two, news, services, universal, news, and, international, news, service, or, ins, the, latter, of, which, he, founded, in, 1909, he, also, owned, ins, companion, radio, station, wins, in, new, york, king, features, syndicate, which, still, owns, the, copyrights, of, a, number, of, popular, comics, characters, a, film, company, cosmopolitan, productions, extensive, new, york, city, real, estate, and, thousands, of, acres, of, land, in, california, and, mexico, along, with, timber, and, mining, interests, inherited, from, his, father, hearst, promoted, writers, and, cartoonists, despite, the, lack, of, any, apparent, demand, for, them, by, his, readers, the, press, critic, a, j, liebling, reminds, us, how, many, of, hearst, s, stars, would, not, have, been, deemed, employable, elsewhere, one, hearst, favorite, george, herriman, was, the, inventor, of, the, dizzy, comic, strip, krazy, kat, not, especially, popular, with, either, readers, or, editors, when, it, was, first, published, in, the, 21st, century, it, is, considered, a, classic, a, belief, once, held, only, by, hearst, himself, in, 1929, he, became, one, of, the, sponsors, of, the, first, round, the, world, voyage, in, an, airship, the, lz, 127, graf, zeppelin, from, germany, his, sponsorship, was, conditional, on, the, trip, starting, at, lakehurst, naval, air, station, new, jersey, the, ship, s, captain, dr, hugo, eckener, first, flew, the, graf, zeppelin, across, the,

states, and, the, vast, over, extension, of, his, empire, cost, him, control, of, his, holdings, it, is, unlikely, that, the, newspapers, ever, paid, their, own, way, mining, ranching, and, forestry, provided, whatever, dividends, the, hearst, corporation, paid, out, when, the, collapse, came, all, hearst, properties, were, hit, hard, but, none, more, so, than, the, papers, hearst, s, conservative, politics, increasingly, at, odds, with, those, of, his, readers, worsened, matters, for, the, once, great, hearst, media, chain, having, been, refused, the, right, to, sell, another, round, of, bonds, to, unsuspecting, investors, the, shaky, empire, tottered, unable, to, service, its, existing, debts, hearst, corporation, faced, a, court, mandated, reorganization, in, 1937, from, that, point, hearst, was, reduced, to, being, an, employee, subject, to, the, directives, of, an, outside, manager, newspapers, and, other, properties, were, liquidated, the, film, company, shut,

he, narrowly, failed, in, attempts, to, become, mayor, of, new, york, city, in, both, 1905, and, 1909, and, governor, of, new, york, in, 1906, nominally, remaining, a, democrat, while, also, creating, the, independence, party, he, was, defeated, for, the, governorship, by, charles, evans, hughes, hearst, s, unsuccessful, campaigns, for, office, after, his, tenure, in, the, house, of, representatives, earned, him, the, unflattering, but, short, lived, nickname, of, william, also, randolph, hearst, which, was, coined, by, wallace, irwin, hearst, was, on, the, left, wing, of, the, progressive, movement, speaking, on, behalf, of, the, working, class, who, bought, his, papers, and, denouncing, the, rich, and, powerful, who, disdained, his, editorials, with, the, support, of, tammany, hall, the, regular, democratic, organization, in, manhattan, hearst, was, elected, to, congress, from, new, york, in, 1902, and, 1904, he, made, a, major, effort, to, win, the, 1904, democratic, nomination, for, president, losing, to, conservative, alton, b, parker, breaking, with, tammany, in, 1907, hearst, ran, for, mayor, of, new, york, city, under, a, third, party, of, his, own, creation, the, municipal, ownership, league, tammany, hall, exerted, its, utmost, to, defeat, him, an, opponent, of, the, british, empire, hearst, opposed, american, involvement, in, the, first, world, war, and, attacked, the, formation, of, the, league, of, nations, his, newspapers, abstained, from, endorsing, any, candidate, in, 1920, and, 1924, hearst, s, last, bid, for, office, came, in, 1922, when, he, was, backed, by, tammany, hall, leaders, for, the, u, s, senate, nomination, in, new, york, al, smith, vetoed, this, earning, the, lasting, enmity, of, hearst, although, hearst, shared, smith, s, opposition, to, prohibition, he, swung, his, papers, behind, herbert, hoover, in, the, 1928, presidential, election, during, the, 1920s, hearst, was, a, jeffersonian, democrat, he, warned, citizens, against, the, dangers, of, big, government, and, against, unchecked, federal, power, that, could, infringe, on, individual, rights, when, unemployment, was, near, 25, percent, it, appeared, that, hoover, would, lose, his, bid, for, reelection, in, 1932, so, hearst, sought, to, block, the, nomination, of, franklin, d, roosevelt, as, the, democratic, challenger, while, continuing, to, oppose, smith, he, promoted, the, rival, candidacy, of, speaker, of, the, house, john, nance, garner, a, texan, whose, guiding, motto, is, america, first, and, who, in, his, own, words, saw, the, gravest, possible, menace, facing, the, country, as, the, constantly, increasing, tendency, toward, socialism, and, communism, at, the, democratic, party, convention, in, 1932, with, control, of, delegations, from, his, own, state, of, california, and, from, garner, s, home, state, of, texas, hearst, had, enough, influence, to, ensure, that, the, triumphant, roosevelt, picked, garner, as, his, running, mate, in, the, anticipation, that, roosevelt, would, turn, out, to, be, in, his, words, properly, conservative, hearst, supported, his, election, but, the, rapprochement,
