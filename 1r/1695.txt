norman, ernest, borlaug, b, r, l, march, 25, 1914, september, 12, 2009, was, an, american, agronomist, who, led, initiatives, worldwide, that, contributed, to, the, extensive, increases, in, agricultural, production, termed, the, green, revolution, borlaug, was, awarded, multiple, honors, for, his, work, including, the, nobel, peace, prize, the, presidential, medal, of, freedom, and, the, congressional, gold, medal, one, of, only, seven, people, to, have, received, all, three, awards, borlaug, received, his, b, s, in, forestry, in, 1937, and, phd, in, plant, pathology, and, genetics, from, the, university, of, minnesota, in, 1942, he, took, up, an, agricultural, research, position, with, cimmyt, in, mexico, where, he, developed, semi, dwarf, high, yield, disease, resistant, wheat, varieties, during, the, mid, 20th, century, borlaug, led, the, introduction, of, these, high, yielding, varieties, combined, with, modern, agricultural, production, techniques, to, mexico, pakistan, and, india, as, a, result, mexico, became, a, net, exporter, of, wheat, by, 1963, between, 1965, and, 1970, wheat, yields, nearly, doubled, in, pakistan, and, india, greatly, improving, the, food, security, in, those, nations, borlaug, was, often, called, the, father, of, the, green, revolution, and, is, credited, with, saving, over, a, billion, people, worldwide, from, starvation, according, to, jan, douglas, executive, assistant, to, the, president, of, the, world, food, prize, foundation, the, source, of, this, number, is, gregg, easterbrook, s, 1997, article, forgotten, benefactor, of, humanity, the, article, states, that, the, form, of, agriculture, that, borlaug, preaches, may, have, prevented, a, billion, deaths, dennis, t, avery, also, estimated, that, the, number, of, lives, saved, by, borlaug, s, efforts, to, be, one, billion, in, 2009, josette, sheeran, then, the, executive, director, of, the, world, food, programme, stated, that, borlaug, saved, more, lives, than, any, man, in, human, history, he, was, awarded, the, 1970, nobel, peace, prize, in, recognition, of, his, contributions, to, world, peace, through, increasing, food, supply, later, in, his, life, he, helped, apply, these, methods, of, increasing, food, production, in, asia, and, africa, he, was, also, an, accomplished, wrestler, in, college, and, a, pioneer, of, wrestling, in, the, united, states, being, inducted, into, the, national, wrestling, hall, of, fame, for, his, contributions, borlaug, was, the, great, grandchild, of, norwegian, immigrants, to, the, united, states, ole, olson, dybevig, and, solveig, thomasdatter, rinde, of, feios, a, small, village, in, vik, kommune, sogn, og, fjordane, norway, emigrated, to, dane, county, wisconsin, in, 1854, the, family, eventually, moved, to, the, small, norwegian, american, community, of, saude, near, cresco, iowa, there, they, were, members, of, saude, lutheran, church, where, norman, was, baptized, and, confirmed, borlaug, was, born, to, henry, oliver, 1889, 1971, and, clara, vaala, borlaug, 1888, 1972, on, his, grandparents, farm, in, saude, in, 1914, the, first, of, four, children, his, three, sisters, were, palma, lillian, behrens, 1916, 2004, charlotte, culbert, 1919, 2012, and, helen, b, d, 1921, from, age, seven, to, nineteen, he, worked, on, the, 106, acre, 43, ha, family, farm, west, of, protivin, fishing, hunting, and, raising, corn, oats, timothy, grass, cattle, pigs, and, chickens, he, attended, the, one, teacher, one, room, new, oregon, 8, rural, school, in, howard, county, through, eighth, grade, today, the, school, building, built, in, 1865, is, owned, by, the, norman, borlaug, heritage, foundation, as, part, of, project, borlaug, legacy, at, cresco, high, school, borlaug, was, a, member, of, the, football, baseball, and, wrestling, teams, his, wrestling, coach, dave, barthelma, continually, encouraged, him, to, give, 105, borlaug, attributed, his, decision, to, leave, the, farm, and, pursue, further, education, to, his, grandfather, s, urgent, encouragement, to, learn, nels, olson, borlaug, 1859, 1935, once, told, him, you, re, wiser, to, fill, your, head, now, if, you, want, to, fill, your, belly, later, on, when, borlaug, applied, for, admission, to, the, university, of, minnesota, in, 1933, he, failed, its, entrance, exam, but, was, accepted, at, the, school, s, newly, created, two, year, general, college, after, two, quarters, he, transferred, to, the, college, of, agriculture, s, forestry, program, as, a, member, of, the, university, of, minnesota, men, s, wrestling, team, borlaug, reached, the, big, ten, semifinals, and, promoted, the, sport, to, minnesota, high, schools, in, exhibition, matches, all, around, the, state, wrestling, taught, me, some, valuable, lessons, i, always, figured, i, could, hold, my, own, against, the, best, in, the, world, it, made, me, tough, many, times, i, drew, on, that, strength, it, s, an, inappropriate, crutch, perhaps, but, that, s, the, way, i, m, made, to, finance, his, studies, borlaug, put, his, education, on, hold, periodically, to, earn, some, income, as, he, did, in, 1935, as, a, leader, in, the, civilian, conservation, corps, working, with, the, unemployed, on, federal, projects, many, of, the, people, who, worked, for, him, were, starving, he, later, recalled, i, saw, how, food, changed, them, all, of, this, left, scars, on, me, from, 1935, to, 1938, before, and, after, receiving, his, bachelor, of, science, in, forestry, in, 1937, borlaug, worked, for, the, united, states, forest, service, at, stations, in, massachusetts, and, idaho, he, spent, one, summer, in, the, middle, fork, of, idaho, s, salmon, river, the, most, isolated, piece, of, wilderness, in, the, nation, at, that, time, in, the, last, months, of, his, undergraduate, education, borlaug, attended, a, sigma, xi, lecture, by, elvin, charles, stakman, a, professor, and, soon, to, be, head, of, the, plant, pathology, group, at, the, university, of, minnesota, the, event, was, a, pivot, for, borlaug, s, future, stakman, in, his, speech, entitled, these, shifty, little, enemies, that, destroy, our, food, crops, discussed, the, manifestation, of, the, plant, disease, rust, a, parasitic, fungus, that, feeds, on, phytonutrients, in, wheat, oats, and, barley, crops, stakman, had, discovered, that, special, plant, breeding, methods, produced, plants, resistant, to, rust, his, research, greatly, interested, borlaug, and, when, borlaug, s, job, at, the, forest, service, was, eliminated, because, of, budget, cuts, he, asked, stakman, if, he, should, go, into, forest, pathology, stakman, advised, him, to, focus, on, plant, pathology, instead, he, subsequently, enrolled, at, the, university, to, study, plant, pathology, under, stakman, borlaug, earned, a, master, of, science, degree, in, 1940, and, a, ph, d, in, plant, pathology, and, genetics, in, 1942, borlaug, was, a, member, of, the, alpha, gamma, rho, fraternity, while, in, college, he, met, his, future, wife, margaret, gibson, as, he, waited, tables, at, a, coffee, shop, in, the, university, s, dinkytown, where, the, two, worked, they, were, married, in, 1937, and, had, three, children, norma, jean, jeanie, laube, scotty, who, died, from, spina, bifida, soon, after, birth, and, william, five, grandchildren, and, six, great, grandchildren, on, march, 8, 2007, margaret, borlaug, died, at, the, age, of, 95, following, a, fall, they, had, been, married, for, 69, years, borlaug, resided, in, dallas, the, last, years, of, his, life, although, his, global, humanitarian, efforts, left, him, with, only, a, few, weeks, of, the, year, to, spend, there, from, 1942, to, 1944, borlaug, was, employed, as, a, microbiologist, at, dupont, in, wilmington, delaware, it, was, planned, that, he, would, lead, research, on, industrial, and, agricultural, bacteriocides, fungicides, and, preservatives, however, following, the, december, 7, 1941, attack, on, pearl, harbor, borlaug, tried, to, enlist, in, the, military, but, was, rejected, under, wartime, labor, regulations, his, lab, was, converted, to, conduct, research, for, the, united, states, armed, forces, one, of, his, first, projects, was, to, develop, glue, that, could, withstand, the, warm, salt, water, of, the, south, pacific, the, imperial, japanese, navy, had, gained, control, of, the, island, of, guadalcanal, and, patrolled, the, sky, and, sea, by, day, the, only, way, for, u, s, forces, to, supply, the, troops, stranded, on, the, island, was, to, approach, at, night, by, speedboat, and, jettison, boxes, of, canned, food, and, other, supplies, into, the, surf, to, wash, ashore, the, problem, was, that, the, glue, holding, these, containers, together, disintegrated, in, saltwater, within, weeks, borlaug, and, his, colleagues, had, developed, an, adhesive, that, resisted, corrosion, allowing, food, and, supplies, to, reach, the, stranded, marines, other, tasks, included, work, with, camouflage, canteen, disinfectants, ddt, to, control, malaria, and, insulation, for, small, electronics, in, 1940, the, avila, camacho, administration, took, office, in, mexico, the, administration, s, primary, goal, for, mexican, agriculture, was, augmenting, the, nation, s, industrialization, and, economic, growth, u, s, vice, president, elect, henry, wallace, who, was, instrumental, in, persuading, the, rockefeller, foundation, to, work, with, the, mexican, government, in, agricultural, development, saw, avila, camacho, s, ambitions, as, beneficial, to, u, s, economic, and, military, interests, the, rockefeller, foundation, contacted, e, c, stakman, and, two, other, leading, agronomists, they, developed, a, proposal, for, a, new, organization, the, office, of, special, studies, as, part, of, the, mexican, government, but, directed, by, the, rockefeller, foundation, it, was, to, be, staffed, with, both, mexican, and, us, scientists, focusing, on, soil, development, maize, and, wheat, production, and, plant, pathology, stakman, chose, dr, jacob, george, dutch, harrar, as, project, leader, harrar, immediately, set, out, to, hire, borlaug, as, head, of, the, newly, established, cooperative, wheat, research, and, production, program, in, mexico, borlaug, declined, choosing, to, finish, his, war, service, at, dupont, in, july, 1944, after, rejecting, dupont, s, offer, to, double, his, salary, and, temporarily, leaving, behind, his, pregnant, wife, and, 14, month, old, daughter, he, flew, to, mexico, city, to, head, the, new, program, as, a, geneticist, and, plant, pathologist, in, 1964, borlaug, was, made, the, director, of, the, international, wheat, improvement, program, at, el, bat, n, texcoco, on, the, eastern, fringes, of, mexico, city, as, part, of, the, newly, established, consultative, group, on, international, agricultural, research, s, international, maize, and, wheat, improvement, center, centro, internacional, de, mejoramiento, de, ma, z, y, trigo, or, cimmyt, funding, for, this, autonomous, international, research, training, institute, developed, from, the, cooperative, wheat, research, production, program, was, undertaken, jointly, by, the, ford, and, rockefeller, foundations, and, the, mexican, government, besides, his, work, in, genetic, resistance, against, crop, loss, borlaug, felt, that, pesticides, including, ddt, had, more, benefits, than, drawbacks, for, humanity, and, advocated, publicly, for, their, continued, use, he, continued, to, support, pesticide, use, despite, the, severe, public, criticism, he, received, for, it, borlaug, mostly, admired, the, work, and, personality, of, rachel, carson, but, lamented, her, silent, spring, what, he, saw, as, an, inaccurate, portrayal, of, the, effects, of, ddt, borlaug, retired, officially, from, the, position, in, 1979, but, remained, a, cimmyt, senior, consultant, in, addition, to, taking, up, charitable, and, educational, roles, he, continued, to, be, involved, in, plant, research, at, cimmyt, with, wheat, triticale, barley, maize, and, high, altitude, sorghum, in, 1981, borlaug, became, a, founding, member, of, the, world, cultural, council, in, 1984, borlaug, began, teaching, and, conducting, research, at, texas, a, m, university, eventually, he, was, given, the, title, distinguished, professor, of, international, agriculture, at, the, university, and, the, holder, of, the, eugene, butler, endowed, chair, in, agricultural, biotechnology, he, advocated, for, agricultural, biotechnology, as, he, had, for, pesticides, in, earlier, decades, publicly, knowledgeably, and, always, despite, heavy, criticism, borlaug, served, on, the, faculty, of, the, university, of, minnesota, university, of, iowa, cornell, university, and, texas, a, m, university, borlaug, remained, at, a, m, until, his, death, in, september, 2009, the, cooperative, wheat, research, production, program, a, joint, venture, by, the, rockefeller, foundation, and, the, mexican, ministry, of, agriculture, involved, research, in, genetics, plant, breeding, plant, pathology, entomology, agronomy, soil, science, and, cereal, technology, the, goal, of, the, project, was, to, boost, wheat, production, in, mexico, which, at, the, time, was, importing, a, large, portion, of, its, grain, plant, pathologist, george, harrar, recruited, and, assembled, the, wheat, research, team, in, late, 1944, the, four, other, members, were, soil, scientist, william, colwell, maize, breeder, edward, wellhausen, potato, breeder, john, niederhauser, and, norman, borlaug, all, from, the, united, states, during, the, sixteen, years, borlaug, remained, with, the, project, he, bred, a, series, of, remarkably, successful, high, yield, disease, resistant, semi, dwarf, wheat, borlaug, said, that, his, first, few, years, in, mexico, were, difficult, he, lacked, trained, scientists, and, equipment, local, farmers, were, hostile, towards, the, wheat, program, because, of, serious, crop, losses, from, 1939, to, 1941, due, to, stem, rust, it, often, appeared, to, me, that, i, had, made, a, dreadful, mistake, in, accepting, the, position, in, mexico, he, wrote, in, the, epilogue, to, his, book, norman, borlaug, on, world, hunger, he, spent, the, first, ten, years, breeding, wheat, cultivars, resistant, to, disease, including, rust, in, that, time, his, group, made, 6, 000, individual, crossings, of, wheat, initially, borlaug, s, work, had, been, concentrated, in, the, central, highlands, in, the, village, of, chapingo, near, texcoco, where, the, problems, with, rust, and, poor, soil, were, most, prevalent, the, village, never, met, their, aims, he, realized, that, he, could, speed, up, breeding, by, taking, advantage, of, the, country, s, two, growing, seasons, in, the, summer, he, would, breed, wheat, in, the, central, highlands, as, usual, then, immediately, take, the, seeds, north, to, the, valle, del, yaqui, research, station, near, ciudad, obreg, n, sonora, the, difference, in, altitudes, and, temperatures, would, allow, more, crops, to, be, grown, each, year, borlaug, s, boss, george, harrar, was, against, this, expansion, besides, the, extra, costs, of, doubling, the, work, borlaug, s, plan, went, against, a, then, held, principle, of, agronomy, that, has, since, been, disproved, it, was, believed, that, to, store, energy, for, germination, before, being, planted, seeds, needed, a, rest, period, after, harvesting, when, harrar, vetoed, his, plan, borlaug, resigned, elvin, stakman, who, was, visiting, the, project, calmed, the, situation, talking, borlaug, into, withdrawing, his, resignation, and, harrar, into, allowing, the, double, wheat, season, as, of, 1945, wheat, would, then, be, bred, at, locations, 700, miles, 1000, km, apart, 10, degrees, apart, in, latitude, and, 8, 500, feet, 2600, m, apart, in, altitude, this, was, called, shuttle, breeding, as, an, unexpected, benefit, of, the, double, wheat, season, the, new, breeds, did, not, have, problems, with, photoperiodism, normally, wheat, varieties, cannot, adapt, to, new, environments, due, to, the, changing, periods, of, sunlight, borlaug, later, recalled, as, it, worked, out, in, the, north, we, were, planting, when, the, days, were, getting, shorter, at, low, elevation, and, high, temperature, then, we, d, take, the, seed, from, the, best, plants, south, and, plant, it, at, high, elevation, when, days, were, getting, longer, and, there, was, lots, of, rain, soon, we, had, varieties, that, fit, the, whole, range, of, conditions, that, wasn, t, supposed, to, happen, by, the, books, this, meant, that, the, project, would, not, need, to, start, separate, breeding, programs, for, each, geographic, region, of, the, planet, because, purebred, genotypically, identical, plant, varieties, often, only, have, one, or, a, few, major, genes, for, disease, resistance, and, plant, diseases, such, as, rust, are, continuously, producing, new, races, that, can, overcome, a, pure, line, s, resistance, multiple, linear, lines, varieties, were, developed, multiline, varieties, are, mixtures, of, several, phenotypically, similar, pure, lines, which, each, have, different, genes, for, disease, resistance, by, having, similar, heights, flowering, and, maturity, dates, seed, colors, and, agronomic, characteristics, they, remain, compatible, with, each, other, and, do, not, reduce, yields, when, grown, together, on, the, field, in, 1953, borlaug, extended, this, technique, by, suggesting, that, several, pure, lines, with, different, resistance, genes, should, be, developed, through, backcross, methods, using, one, recurrent, parent, backcrossing, involves, crossing, a, hybrid, and, subsequent, generations, with, a, recurrent, parent, as, a, result, the, genotype, of, the, backcrossed, progeny, becomes, increasingly, similar, to, that, of, the, recurrent, parent, borlaug, s, method, would, allow, the, various, different, disease, resistant, genes, from, several, donor, parents, to, be, transferred, into, a, single, recurrent, parent, to, make, sure, each, line, has, different, resistant, genes, each, donor, parent, is, used, in, a, separate, backcross, program, between, five, and, ten, of, these, lines, may, then, be, mixed, depending, upon, the, races, of, pathogen, present, in, the, region, as, this, process, is, repeated, some, lines, will, become, susceptible, to, the, pathogen, these, lines, can, easily, be, replaced, with, new, resistant, lines, as, new, sources, of, resistance, become, available, new, lines, are, developed, in, this, way, the, loss, of, crops, is, kept, to, a, minimum, because, only, one, or, a, few, lines, become, susceptible, to, a, pathogen, within, a, given, season, and, all, other, crops, are, unaffected, by, the, disease, because, the, disease, would, spread, more, slowly, than, if, the, entire, population, were, susceptible, this, also, reduces, the, damage, to, susceptible, lines, there, is, still, the, possibility, that, a, new, race, of, pathogen, will, develop, to, which, all, lines, are, susceptible, however, dwarfing, is, an, important, agronomic, quality, for, wheat, dwarf, plants, produce, thick, stems, the, cultivars, borlaug, worked, with, had, tall, thin, stalks, taller, wheat, grasses, better, compete, for, sunlight, but, tend, to, collapse, under, the, weight, of, the, extra, grain, a, trait, called, lodging, from, the, rapid, growth, spurts, induced, by, nitrogen, fertilizer, borlaug, used, in, the, poor, soil, to, prevent, this, he, bred, wheat, to, favor, shorter, stronger, stalks, that, could, better, support, larger, seed, heads, in, 1953, he, acquired, a, japanese, dwarf, variety, of, wheat, called, norin, 10, developed, by, the, agronomist, gonjiro, inazuka, in, iwate, prefecture, including, ones, which, had, been, crossed, with, a, high, yielding, american, cultivar, called, brevor, 14, by, orville, vogel, norin, 10, brevor, 14, is, semi, dwarf, one, half, to, two, thirds, the, height, of, standard, varieties, and, produces, more, stalks, and, thus, more, heads, of, grain, per, plant, also, larger, amounts, of, assimilate, were, partitioned, into, the, actual, grains, further, increasing, the, yield, borlaug, crossbred, the, semi, dwarf, norin, 10, brevor, 14, cultivar, with, his, disease, resistant, cultivars, to, produce, wheat, varieties, that, were, adapted, to, tropical, and, sub, tropical, climates, borlaug, s, new, semi, dwarf, disease, resistant, varieties, called, pitic, 62, and, penjamo, 62, changed, the, potential, yield, of, spring, wheat, dramatically, by, 1963, 95, of, mexico, s, wheat, crops, used, the, semi, dwarf, varieties, developed, by, borlaug, that, year, the, harvest, was, six, times, larger, than, in, 1944, the, year, borlaug, arrived, in, mexico, mexico, had, become, fully, self, sufficient, in, wheat, production, and, a, net, exporter, of, wheat, four, other, high, yield, varieties, were, also, released, in, 1964, lerma, rojo, 64, siete, cerros, sonora, 64, and, super, x, in, 1961, to, 1962, borlaug, s, dwarf, spring, wheat, strains, were, sent, for, multilocation, testing, in, the, international, wheat, rust, nursery, organized, by, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, in, march, 1962, a, few, of, these, strains, were, grown, in, the, fields, of, the, indian, agricultural, research, institute, in, pusa, new, delhi, india, in, may, 1962, m, s, swaminathan, a, member, of, iari, s, wheat, program, requested, of, dr, b, p, pal, director, of, iari, to, arrange, for, the, visit, of, borlaug, to, india, and, to, obtain, a, wide, range, of, dwarf, wheat, seed, possessing, the, norin, 10, dwarfing, genes, the, letter, was, forwarded, to, the, indian, ministry, of, agriculture, headed, by, shri, c, subramaniam, which, arranged, with, the, rockefeller, foundation, for, borlaug, s, visit, in, march, 1963, the, rockefeller, foundation, and, the, mexican, government, sent, borlaug, and, dr, robert, glenn, anderson, to, india, to, continue, his, work, he, supplied, 100, kg, 220, lb, of, seed, from, each, of, the, four, most, promising, strains, and, 630, promising, selections, in, advanced, generations, to, the, iari, in, october, 1963, and, test, plots, were, subsequently, planted, at, delhi, ludhiana, pant, nagar, kanpur, pune, and, indore, anderson, stayed, as, head, of, the, rockefeller, foundation, wheat, program, in, new, delhi, until, 1975, during, the, mid, 1960s, the, indian, subcontinent, was, at, war, and, experienced, minor, famine, and, starvation, which, was, limited, partially, by, the, u, s, shipping, a, fifth, of, its, wheat, production, to, india, in, 1966, and, 1967, the, indian, and, pakistani, bureaucracies, and, the, region, s, cultural, opposition, to, new, agricultural, techniques, initially, prevented, borlaug, from, fulfilling, his, desire, to, immediately, plant, the, new, wheat, strains, there, in, 1965, as, a, response, to, food, shortages, borlaug, imported, 550, tons, of, seeds, for, the, government, biologist, paul, r, ehrlich, wrote, in, his, 1968, bestseller, the, population, bomb, the, battle, to, feed, all, of, humanity, is, over, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, hundreds, of, millions, of, people, will, starve, to, death, in, spite, of, any, crash, programs, embarked, upon, now, ehrlich, said, i, have, yet, to, meet, anyone, familiar, with, the, situation, who, thinks, india, will, be, self, sufficient, in, food, by, 1971, and, india, couldn, t, possibly, feed, two, hundred, million, more, people, by, 1980, in, 1965, after, extensive, testing, borlaug, s, team, under, anderson, began, its, effort, by, importing, about, 450, tons, of, lerma, rojo, and, sonora, 64, semi, dwarf, seed, varieties, 250, tons, went, to, pakistan, and, 200, to, india, they, encountered, many, obstacles, their, first, shipment, of, wheat, was, held, up, in, mexican, customs, and, so, it, could, not, be, shipped, from, the, port, at, guaymas, in, time, for, proper, planting, instead, it, was, sent, via, a, 30, truck, convoy, from, mexico, to, the, u, s, port, in, los, angeles, encountering, delays, at, the, mexico, united, states, border, once, the, convoy, entered, the, u, s, it, had, to, take, a, detour, as, the, u, s, national, guard, had, closed, the, freeway, due, to, the, watts, riots, in, los, angeles, when, the, seeds, reached, los, angeles, a, mexican, bank, refused, to, honor, pakistan, treasury, s, payment, of, us, 100, 000, because, the, check, contained, three, misspelled, words, still, the, seed, was, loaded, onto, a, freighter, destined, for, bombay, india, and, karachi, pakistan, twelve, hours, into, the, freighter, s, voyage, war, broke, out, between, india, and, pakistan, over, the, kashmir, region, borlaug, received, a, telegram, from, the, pakistani, minister, of, agriculture, malik, khuda, bakhsh, bucha, i, m, sorry, to, hear, you, are, having, trouble, with, my, check, but, i, ve, got, troubles, too, bombs, are, falling, on, my, front, lawn, be, patient, the, money, is, in, the, bank, these, delays, prevented, borlaug, s, group, from, conducting, the, germination, tests, needed, to, determine, seed, quality, and, proper, seeding, levels, they, started, planting, immediately, and, often, worked, in, sight, of, artillery, flashes, a, week, later, borlaug, discovered, that, his, seeds, were, germinating, at, less, than, half, the, normal, rate, it, later, turned, out, that, the, seeds, had, been, damaged, in, a, mexican, warehouse, by, over, fumigation, with, a, pesticide, he, immediately, ordered, all, locations, to, double, their, seeding, rates, the, initial, yields, of, borlaug, s, crops, were, higher, than, any, ever, harvested, in, south, asia, the, countries, subsequently, committed, to, importing, large, quantities, of, both, the, lerma, rojo, 64, and, sonora, 64, varieties, in, 1966, india, imported, 18, 000, tons, the, largest, purchase, and, import, of, any, seed, in, the, world, at, that, time, in, 1967, pakistan, imported, 42, 000, tons, and, turkey, 21, 000, tons, pakistan, s, import, planted, on, 1, 5, million, acres, 6, 100, km, 2, produced, enough, wheat, to, seed, the, entire, nation, s, wheatland, the, following, year, by, 1968, when, ehrlich, s, book, was, released, william, gaud, of, the, united, states, agency, for, international, development, was, calling, borlaug, s, work, a, green, revolution, high, yields, led, to, a, shortage, of, various, utilities, labor, to, harvest, the, crops, bullock, carts, to, haul, it, to, the, threshing, floor, jute, bags, trucks, rail, cars, and, grain, storage, facilities, some, local, governments, were, forced, to, close, school, buildings, temporarily, to, use, them, for, grain, storage, in, pakistan, wheat, yields, nearly, doubled, from, 4, 6, million, tons, in, 1965, to, 7, 3, million, tons, in, 1970, pakistan, was, self, sufficient, in, wheat, production, by, 1968, yields, were, over, 21, million, tons, by, 2000, in, india, yields, increased, from, 12, 3, million, tons, in, 1965, to, 20, 1, million, tons, in, 1970, by, 1974, india, was, self, sufficient, in, the, production, of, all, cereals, by, 2000, india, was, harvesting, a, record, 76, 4, million, tons, 2, 81, billion, bushels, of, wheat, since, the, 1960s, food, production, in, both, nations, has, increased, faster, than, the, rate, of, population, growth, india, s, use, of, high, yield, farming, has, prevented, an, estimated, 100, million, acres, 400, 000, km, 2, of, virgin, land, from, being, converted, into, farmland, an, area, about, the, size, of, california, or, 13, 6, of, the, total, area, of, india, the, use, of, these, wheat, varieties, has, also, had, a, substantial, effect, on, production, in, six, latin, american, countries, six, countries, in, the, near, and, middle, east, and, several, others, in, africa, borlaug, s, work, with, wheat, contributed, to, the, development, of, high, yield, semi, dwarf, indica, and, japonica, rice, cultivars, at, the, international, rice, research, institute, and, china, s, hunan, rice, research, institute, borlaug, s, colleagues, at, the, consultative, group, on, international, agricultural, research, also, developed, and, introduced, a, high, yield, variety, of, rice, throughout, most, of, asia, land, devoted, to, the, semi, dwarf, wheat, and, rice, varieties, in, asia, expanded, from, 200, acres, 0, 8, km, 2, in, 1965, to, over, 40, million, acres, 160, 000, km, 2, in, 1970, in, 1970, this, land, accounted, for, over, 10, of, the, more, productive, cereal, land, in, asia, for, his, contributions, to, the, world, food, supply, borlaug, was, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, 1970, norwegian, officials, notified, his, wife, in, mexico, city, at, 4, 00, a, m, but, borlaug, had, already, left, for, the, test, fields, in, the, toluca, valley, about, 40, miles, 65, km, west, of, mexico, city, a, chauffeur, took, her, to, the, fields, to, inform, her, husband, according, to, his, daughter, jeanie, laube, my, mom, said, you, won, the, nobel, peace, prize, and, he, said, no, i, haven, t, it, took, some, convincing, he, thought, the, whole, thing, was, a, hoax, he, was, awarded, the, prize, on, december, 10, in, his, nobel, lecture, the, following, day, he, speculated, on, his, award, when, the, nobel, peace, prize, committee, designated, me, the, recipient, of, the, 1970, award, for, my, contribution, to, the, green, revolution, they, were, in, effect, i, believe, selecting, an, individual, to, symbolize, the, vital, role, of, agriculture, and, food, production, in, a, world, that, is, hungry, both, for, bread, and, for, peace, his, speech, repeatedly, presented, improvements, in, food, production, within, a, sober, understanding, of, the, context, of, population, the, green, revolution, has, won, a, temporary, success, in, man, s, war, against, hunger, and, deprivation, it, has, given, man, a, breathing, space, if, fully, implemented, the, revolution, can, provide, sufficient, food, for, sustenance, during, the, next, three, decades, but, the, frightening, power, of, human, reproduction, must, also, be, curbed, otherwise, the, success, of, the, green, revolution, will, be, ephemeral, only, most, people, still, fail, to, comprehend, the, magnitude, and, menace, of, the, population, monster, since, man, is, potentially, a, rational, being, however, i, am, confident, that, within, the, next, two, decades, he, will, recognize, the, self, destructive, course, he, steers, along, the, road, of, irresponsible, population, growth, borlaug, continually, advocated, increasing, crop, yields, as, a, means, to, curb, deforestation, the, large, role, he, played, in, both, increasing, crop, yields, and, promoting, this, view, has, led, to, this, methodology, being, called, by, agricultural, economists, the, borlaug, hypothesis, namely, that, increasing, the, productivity, of, agriculture, on, the, best, farmland, can, help, control, deforestation, by, reducing, the, demand, for, new, farmland, according, to, this, view, assuming, that, global, food, demand, is, on, the, rise, restricting, crop, usage, to, traditional, low, yield, methods, would, also, require, at, least, one, of, the, following, the, world, population, to, decrease, either, voluntarily, or, as, a, result, of, mass, starvations, or, the, conversion, of, forest, land, into, crop, land, it, is, thus, argued, that, high, yield, techniques, are, ultimately, saving, ecosystems, from, destruction, on, a, global, scale, this, view, holds, strictly, true, ceteris, paribus, if, deforestation, only, occurs, to, increase, land, for, agriculture, but, other, land, uses, exist, such, as, urban, areas, pasture, or, fallow, so, further, research, is, necessary, to, ascertain, what, land, has, been, converted, for, what, purposes, to, determine, how, true, this, view, remains, increased, profits, from, high, yield, production, may, also, induce, cropland, expansion, in, any, case, although, as, world, food, needs, decrease, this, expansion, may, decrease, as, well, borlaug, expressed, the, idea, now, known, as, the, borlaug, hypothesis, in, a, speech, given, in, oslo, norway, in, 2000, upon, the, occasion, of, the, 30th, anniversary, of, his, acceptance, of, the, nobel, peace, prize, had, the, global, cereal, yields, of, 1950, still, prevailed, in, 1999, we, would, have, needed, nearly, 1, 8, billion, ha, of, additional, land, of, the, same, quality, instead, of, the, 600, million, that, was, used, to, equal, the, current, global, harvest, borlaug, s, name, is, nearly, synonymous, with, the, green, revolution, against, which, many, criticisms, have, been, mounted, over, the, decades, throughout, his, years, of, research, borlaug, s, programs, often, faced, opposition, by, nonscientists, who, consider, genetic, crossbreeding, to, be, unnatural, and, therefore, those, that, inherently, dislike, the, unnatural, criticized, such, crossbreeding, these, farming, techniques, in, addition, to, increasing, yields, often, reaped, large, profits, for, u, s, agribusiness, and, agrochemical, corporations, and, were, criticized, by, one, author, in, 2003, as, widening, social, inequality, in, the, countries, owing, to, uneven, food, distribution, while, forcing, a, capitalist, agenda, of, u, s, corporations, onto, countries, that, had, undergone, land, reform, other, concerns, include, the, crossing, of, genetic, barriers, the, inability, of, a, single, crop, to, fulfill, all, nutritional, requirements, the, decreased, biodiversity, from, planting, few, varieties, the, environmental, and, economic, effects, of, inorganic, fertilizer, and, pesticides, the, side, effects, of, large, amounts, of, herbicides, sprayed, on, fields, of, herbicide, resistant, crops, and, the, destruction, of, wilderness, caused, by, the, construction, of, roads, in, populated, third, world, areas, borlaug, refuted, or, dismissed, most, claims, of, his, critics, but, did, take, certain, concerns, seriously, he, stated, that, his, work, has, been, a, change, in, the, right, direction, but, it, has, not, transformed, the, world, into, a, utopia, of, environmental, lobbyists, opposing, crop, yield, improvements, he, stated, some, of, the, environmental, lobbyists, of, the, western, nations, are, the, salt, of, the, earth, but, many, of, them, are, elitists, they, ve, never, experienced, the, physical, sensation, of, hunger, they, do, their, lobbying, from, comfortable, office, suites, in, washington, or, brussels, if, they, lived, just, one, month, amid, the, misery, of, the, developing, world, as, i, have, for, fifty, years, they, d, be, crying, out, for, tractors, and, fertilizer, and, irrigation, canals, and, be, outraged, that, fashionable, elitists, back, home, were, trying, to, deny, them, these, things, borlaug, cautioned, there, are, no, miracles, in, agricultural, production, nor, is, there, such, a, thing, as, a, miracle, variety, of, wheat, rice, or, maize, which, can, serve, as, an, elixir, to, cure, all, ills, of, a, stagnant, traditional, agriculture, the, journalist, john, vidal, writing, in, the, guardian, commented, that, the, plaudits, and, honors, heaped, on, borlaug, present, him, as, a, saint, or, even, the, god, of, american, farmers, but, that, the, technology, was, far, from, perfect, the, green, revolution, promised, to, end, hunger, and, poverty, and, to, benefit, rural, societies, everywhere, instead, its, long, term, effects, included, what, the, indian, environmentalist, vandana, shiva, has, called, rural, impoverishment, increased, debt, social, inequality, and, the, displacement, of, vast, numbers, of, peasant, farmers, vidal, further, cites, the, political, commentator, alexander, cockburn, who, wrote, that, borlaug, was, aside, from, kissinger, probably, the, biggest, killer, of, all, to, have, got, the, peace, prize, given, that, his, wheat, led, to, the, death, of, peasants, by, the, million, following, his, retirement, borlaug, continued, to, participate, in, teaching, research, and, activism, he, spent, much, of, the, year, based, at, cimmyt, in, mexico, conducting, research, and, four, months, of, the, year, serving, at, texas, a, m, university, where, he, had, been, a, distinguished, professor, of, international, agriculture, since, 1984, from, 1994, to, 2003, borlaug, served, on, the, international, fertilizer, development, center, board, of, directors, in, 1999, the, university, s, board, of, regents, named, its, us, 16, million, center, for, southern, crop, improvement, in, honor, of, borlaug, he, worked, in, the, building, s, heep, center, and, taught, one, semester, each, year, in, the, early, 1980s, environmental, groups, that, were, opposed, to, borlaug, s, methods, campaigned, against, his, planned, expansion, of, efforts, into, africa, they, prompted, the, rockefeller, and, ford, foundations, and, the, world, bank, to, stop, funding, most, of, his, african, agriculture, projects, western, european, governments, were, persuaded, to, stop, supplying, fertilizer, to, africa, according, to, david, seckler, former, director, general, of, the, international, water, management, institute, the, environmental, community, in, the, 1980s, went, crazy, pressuring, the, donor, countries, and, the, big, foundations, not, to, support, ideas, like, inorganic, fertilizers, for, africa, in, 1984, during, the, ethiopian, famine, ryoichi, sasakawa, the, chairman, of, the, japan, shipbuilding, industry, foundation, now, the, nippon, foundation, contacted, the, semi, retired, borlaug, wondering, why, the, methods, used, in, asia, were, not, extended, to, africa, and, hoping, borlaug, could, help, he, convinced, borlaug, to, help, with, this, new, effort, and, borlaug, assisted, in, creating, the, sasakawa, africa, association, saa, to, coordinate, the, project, the, saa, is, a, research, and, extension, organization, that, aims, to, increase, food, production, in, african, countries, that, are, struggling, with, food, shortages, i, assumed, we, d, do, a, few, years, of, research, first, borlaug, later, recalled, but, after, i, saw, the, terrible, circumstances, there, i, said, let, s, just, start, growing, soon, borlaug, and, the, saa, had, projects, in, seven, countries, yields, of, maize, in, developed, african, countries, tripled, yields, of, wheat, sorghum, cassava, and, cowpeas, also, increased, in, these, countries, at, present, more, than, ten, years, after, borlaug, s, death, in, 2009, program, activities, are, under, way, in, benin, burkina, faso, ethiopia, ghana, guinea, mali, malawi, mozambique, nigeria, tanzania, and, uganda, all, of, which, suffered, from, repeated, famines, in, previous, decades, from, 1986, to, 2009, borlaug, was, the, president, of, the, saa, that, year, a, joint, venture, between, the, carter, center, and, saa, was, launched, called, sasakawa, global, 2000, sg, 2000, the, program, focuses, on, food, population, and, agricultural, policy, since, then, more, than, 8, million, small, scale, farmers, in, 15, african, countries, have, been, trained, in, saa, farming, techniques, which, have, helped, them, to, double, or, triple, grain, production, those, elements, that, allowed, borlaug, s, projects, to, succeed, in, india, and, pakistan, such, as, well, organized, market, economies, transportation, and, irrigation, systems, are, severely, lacking, throughout, much, of, africa, posing, additional, obstacles, to, increasing, yields, and, reducing, the, ongoing, threat, of, food, shortages, because, of, these, challenges, borlaug, s, initial, projects, were, restricted, to, relatively, developed, regions, of, the, continent, despite, these, setbacks, borlaug, found, encouragement, visiting, ethiopia, in, 1994, after, a, major, famine, jimmy, carter, won, prime, minister, meles, zenawi, s, support, for, a, campaign, seeking, to, aid, farmers, using, the, fertilizer, diammonium, phosphate, and, borlaug, s, methods, the, following, season, ethiopia, recorded, the, largest, harvests, of, major, crops, in, history, with, a, 32, increase, in, production, and, a, 15, increase, in, average, yield, over, the, previous, season, for, borlaug, the, rapid, increase, in, yields, suggested, that, there, was, still, hope, for, higher, food, production, throughout, sub, saharan, africa, despite, lingering, questions, about, population, sustainability, and, the, absence, of, long, term, studies, in, africa, the, world, food, prize, is, an, international, award, recognizing, the, achievements, of, individuals, who, have, advanced, human, development, by, improving, the, quality, quantity, or, availability, of, food, in, the, world, the, prize, was, created, in, 1986, by, norman, borlaug, as, a, way, to, recognize, personal, accomplishments, and, as, a, means, of, education, by, using, the, prize, to, establish, role, models, for, others, the, first, prize, was, given, to, borlaug, s, former, colleague, m, s, swaminathan, in, 1987, for, his, work, in, india, the, next, year, swaminathan, used, the, us, 250, 000, prize, to, start, the, ms, swaminathan, research, foundation, for, research, on, sustainable, development, in, 2005, borlaug, with, his, former, graduate, student, ronnie, coffman, convened, an, international, expert, panel, in, kenya, on, the, emerging, threat, of, ug99, in, east, africa, the, working, group, produced, a, report, sounding, the, alarm, on, global, stem, rust, and, their, work, led, to, the, formation, of, the, global, rust, initiative, in, 2008, with, funding, from, the, bill, melinda, gates, foundation, the, organization, was, re, named, the, borlaug, global, rust, initiative, the, limited, potential, for, land, expansion, for, cultivation, worried, borlaug, who, in, march, 2005, stated, that, we, will, have, to, double, the, world, food, supply, by, 2050, with, 85, of, future, growth, in, food, production, having, to, come, from, lands, already, in, use, he, recommends, a, multidisciplinary, research, focus, to, further, increase, yields, mainly, through, increased, crop, immunity, to, large, scale, diseases, such, as, the, rust, fungus, which, affects, all, cereals, but, rice, his, dream, was, to, transfer, rice, immunity, to, cereals, such, as, wheat, maize, sorghum, and, barley, and, transfer, bread, wheat, proteins, gliadin, and, glutenin, to, other, cereals, especially, rice, and, maize, borlaug, believed, that, genetically, modified, organisms, gmo, were, the, only, way, to, increase, food, production, as, the, world, runs, out, of, unused, arable, land, gmos, were, not, inherently, dangerous, because, we, ve, been, genetically, modifying, plants, and, animals, for, a, long, time, long, before, we, called, it, science, people, were, selecting, the, best, breeds, in, a, review, of, borlaug, s, 2000, publication, entitled, ending, world, hunger, the, promise, of, biotechnology, and, the, threat, of, antiscience, zealotry, the, authors, argued, that, borlaug, s, warnings, were, still, true, in, 2010, gm, crops, are, as, natural, and, safe, as, today, s, bread, wheat, opined, dr, borlaug, who, also, reminded, agricultural, scientists, of, their, moral, obligation, to, stand, up, to, the, antiscience, crowd, and, warn, policy, makers, that, global, food, insecurity, will, not, disappear, without, this, new, technology, and, ignoring, this, reality, global, food, insecurity, would, make, future, solutions, all, the, more, difficult, to, achieve, according, to, borlaug, africa, the, former, soviet, republics, and, the, cerrado, are, the, last, frontiers, after, they, are, in, use, the, world, will, have, no, additional, sizable, blocks, of, arable, land, left, to, put, into, production, unless, you, are, willing, to, level, whole, forests, which, you, should, not, do, so, future, food, production, increases, will, have, to, come, from, higher, yields, and, though, i, have, no, doubt, yields, will, keep, going, up, whether, they, can, go, up, enough, to, feed, the, population, monster, is, another, matter, unless, progress, with, agricultural, yields, remains, very, strong, the, next, century, will, experience, sheer, human, misery, that, on, a, numerical, scale, will, exceed, the, worst, of, everything, that, has, come, before, besides, increasing, the, worldwide, food, supply, early, in, his, career, borlaug, stated, that, taking, steps, to, decrease, the, rate, of, population, growth, will, also, be, necessary, to, prevent, food, shortages, in, his, nobel, lecture, of, 1970, borlaug, stated, most, people, still, fail, to, comprehend, the, magnitude, and, menace, of, the, population, monster, if, it, continues, to, increase, at, the, estimated, present, rate, of, two, percent, a, year, the, world, population, will, reach, 6, 5, billion, by, the, year, 2000, currently, with, each, second, or, tick, of, the, clock, about, 2, 2, additional, people, are, added, to, the, world, population, the, rhythm, of, increase, will, accelerate, to, 2, 7, 3, 3, and, 4, 0, for, each, tick, of, the, clock, by, 1980, 1990, and, 2000, respectively, unless, man, becomes, more, realistic, and, preoccupied, about, this, impending, doom, the, tick, tock, of, the, clock, will, continually, grow, louder, and, more, menacing, each, decade, where, will, it, all, end, however, some, observers, have, suggested, that, by, the, 1990s, borlaug, had, changed, his, position, on, population, control, they, point, to, a, quote, from, the, year, 2000, in, which, he, stated, i, now, say, that, the, world, has, the, technology, either, available, or, well, advanced, in, the, research, pipeline, to, feed, on, a, sustainable, basis, a, population, of, 10, billion, people, the, more, pertinent, question, today, is, whether, farmers, and, ranchers, will, be, permitted, to, use, this, new, technology, while, the, affluent, nations, can, certainly, afford, to, adopt, ultra, low, risk, positions, and, pay, more, for, food, produced, by, the, so, called, organic, methods, the, one, billion, chronically, undernourished, people, of, the, low, income, food, deficit, nations, cannot, however, borlaug, remained, on, the, advisory, board, of, population, media, center, an, organization, working, to, stabilize, world, population, until, his, death, borlaug, died, of, lymphoma, at, the, age, of, 95, on, september, 12, 2009, in, his, dallas, home, borlaug, s, children, released, a, statement, saying, we, would, like, his, life, to, be, a, model, for, making, a, difference, in, the, lives, of, others, and, to, bring, about, efforts, to, end, human, misery, for, all, mankind, the, prime, minister, of, india, manmohan, singh, and, president, of, india, pratibha, patil, paid, tribute, to, borlaug, saying, borlaug, s, life, and, achievement, are, testimony, to, the, far, reaching, contribution, that, one, man, s, towering, intellect, persistence, and, scientific, vision, can, make, to, human, peace, and, progress, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, described, borlaug, as, a, towering, scientist, whose, work, rivals, that, of, the, 20th, century, s, other, great, scientific, benefactors, of, humankind, and, kofi, annan, former, secretary, general, of, the, united, nations, said, as, we, celebrate, dr, borlaug, s, long, and, remarkable, life, we, also, celebrate, the, long, and, productive, lives, that, his, achievements, have, made, possible, for, so, many, millions, of, people, around, the, world, we, will, continue, to, be, inspired, by, his, enduring, devotion, to, the, poor, needy, and, vulnerable, of, our, world, in, 1968, borlaug, received, what, he, considered, an, especially, satisfying, tribute, when, the, people, of, ciudad, obreg, n, where, some, of, his, earliest, experiments, were, undertaken, named, a, street, after, him, also, in, that, year, he, became, a, member, of, the, u, s, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1970, he, was, given, an, honorary, doctorate, by, the, agricultural, university, of, norway, in, 1970, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, by, the, norwegian, nobel, committee, for, his, contributions, to, the, green, revolution, that, was, having, such, an, impact, on, food, production, particularly, in, asia, and, in, latin, america, in, 1970, he, was, awarded, the, order, of, the, aztec, eagle, by, the, mexican,

india, in, 1975, he, was, named, a, distinguished, fellow, of, the, iowa, academy, of, science, in, 1980, he, received, the, s, roger, horchow, award, for, greatest, public, service, by, a, private, citizen, an, award, given, out, annually, by, jefferson, awards, in, 1980, he, was, elected, honorary, member, of, the, hungarian, academy, of, sciences, in, 1984, his, name, was, placed, in, the, national, agricultural, hall, of, fame, at, the, national, center, in, bonner, springs, kansas, also, that, year, he, was, recognized, for, sustained, service, to, humanity, through, outstanding, contributions, in, plant, breeding, from, the, governors, conference, on, agriculture, innovations, in, little, rock, arkansas, also, in, 1984, he, received, the, henry, g, bennet, distinguished, service, award, at, commencement, ceremonies, at, oklahoma, state, university, in, 1986, borlaug, was, inducted, into, the, scandinavian, american, hall, of, fame, during, norsk, h, stfest, borlaug, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1987, borlaug, had, a, long, history, of, involvement, with, the, council, for, agricultural, science, and, technology, cast,
