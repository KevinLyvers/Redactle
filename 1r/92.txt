as, caravaggio, was, an, italian, painter, active, in, rome, for, most, of, his, artistic, life, during, the, final, four, years, of, his, life, he, moved, between, naples, malta, and, sicily, until, his, death, his, paintings, have, been, characterized, by, art, critics, as, combining, a, realistic, observation, of, the, human, state, both, physical, and, emotional, with, a, dramatic, use, of, lighting, which, had, a, formative, influence, on, baroque, painting, caravaggio, employed, close, physical, observation, with, a, dramatic, use, of, chiaroscuro, that, came, to, be, known, as, tenebrism, he, made, the, technique, a, dominant, stylistic, element, transfixing, subjects, in, bright, shafts, of, light, and, darkening, shadows, caravaggio, vividly, expressed, crucial, moments, and, scenes, often, featuring, violent, struggles, torture, and, death, he, worked, rapidly, with, live, models, preferring, to, forgo, drawings, and, work, directly, onto, the, canvas, his, inspiring, effect, on, the, new, baroque, style, that, emerged, from, mannerism, was, profound, his, influence, can, be, seen, directly, or, indirectly, in, the, work, of, peter, paul, rubens, jusepe, de, ribera, gian, lorenzo, bernini, and, rembrandt, artists, heavily, under, his, influence, were, called, the, caravaggisti, or, caravagesques, as, well, as, tenebrists, or, tenebrosi, shadowists, caravaggio, trained, as, a, painter, in, milan, before, moving, to, rome, when, he, was, in, his, twenties, he, developed, a, considerable, name, as, an, artist, and, as, a, violent, touchy, and, provocative, man, he, killed, ranuccio, tommasoni, in, a, brawl, which, led, to, a, death, sentence, for, murder, and, forced, him, to, flee, to, naples, there, he, again, established, himself, as, one, of, the, most, prominent, italian, painters, of, his, generation, he, travelled, to, malta, and, on, to, sicily, in, 1607, and, pursued, a, papal, pardon, for, his, sentence, in, 1609, he, returned, to, naples, where, he, was, involved, in, a, violent, clash, his, face, was, disfigured, and, rumours, of, his, death, circulated, questions, about, his, mental, state, arose, from, his, erratic, and, bizarre, behavior, he, died, in, 1610, under, uncertain, circumstances, while, on, his, way, from, naples, to, rome, reports, stated, that, he, died, of, a, fever, but, suggestions, have, been, made, that, he, was, murdered, or, that, he, died, of, lead, poisoning, caravaggio, s, innovations, inspired, baroque, painting, but, the, latter, incorporated, the, drama, of, his, chiaroscuro, without, the, psychological, realism, the, style, evolved, and, fashions, changed, and, caravaggio, fell, out, of, favour, in, the, 20th, century, interest, in, his, work, revived, and, his, importance, to, the, development, of, western, art, was, reevaluated, the, 20th, century, art, historian, andr, berne, joffroy, stated, what, begins, in, the, work, of, caravaggio, is, quite, simply, modern, painting, caravaggio, michelangelo, merisi, or, amerighi, was, born, in, milan, where, his, father, fermo, fermo, merixio, was, a, household, administrator, and, architect, decorator, to, the, marquess, of, caravaggio, a, town, 35, km, to, the, east, of, milan, and, south, of, bergamo, in, 1576, the, family, moved, to, caravaggio, to, escape, a, plague, that, ravaged, milan, and, caravaggio, s, father, and, grandfather, both, died, there, on, the, same, day, in, 1577, it, is, assumed, that, the, artist, grew, up, in, caravaggio, but, his, family, kept, up, connections, with, the, sforzas, and, the, powerful, colonna, family, who, were, allied, by, marriage, with, the, sforzas, and, destined, to, play, a, major, role, later, in, caravaggio, s, life, caravaggio, s, mother, had, to, raise, all, of, her, five, children, in, poverty, she, died, in, 1584, the, same, year, he, began, his, four, year, apprenticeship, to, the, milanese, painter, simone, peterzano, described, in, the, contract, of, apprenticeship, as, a, pupil, of, titian, caravaggio, appears, to, have, stayed, in, the, milan, caravaggio, area, after, his, apprenticeship, ended, but, it, is, possible, that, he, visited, venice, and, saw, the, works, of, giorgione, whom, federico, zuccari, later, accused, him, of, imitating, and, titian, he, would, also, have, become, familiar, with, the, art, treasures, of, milan, including, leonardo, da, vinci, s, last, supper, and, with, the, regional, lombard, art, a, style, that, valued, simplicity, and, attention, to, naturalistic, detail, and, was, closer, to, the, naturalism, of, germany, than, to, the, stylised, formality, and, grandeur, of, roman, mannerism, following, his, initial, training, under, simone, peterzano, in, 1592, caravaggio, left, milan, for, rome, in, flight, after, certain, quarrels, and, the, wounding, of, a, police, officer, the, young, artist, arrived, in, rome, naked, and, extremely, needy, without, fixed, address, and, without, provision, short, of, money, during, this, period, he, stayed, with, the, miserly, pandolfo, pucci, known, as, monsignor, insalata, a, few, months, later, he, was, performing, hack, work, for, the, highly, successful, giuseppe, cesari, pope, clement, viii, s, favourite, artist, painting, flowers, and, fruit, in, his, factory, like, workshop, in, rome, there, was, a, demand, for, paintings, to, fill, the, many, huge, new, churches, and, palaces, being, built, at, the, time, it, was, also, a, period, when, the, church, was, searching, for, a, stylistic, alternative, to, mannerism, in, religious, art, that, was, tasked, to, counter, the, threat, of, protestantism, caravaggio, s, innovation, was, a, radical, naturalism, that, combined, close, physical, observation, with, a, dramatic, even, theatrical, use, of, chiaroscuro, that, came, to, be, known, as, tenebrism, the, shift, from, light, to, dark, with, little, intermediate, value, known, works, from, this, period, include, the, small, boy, peeling, a, fruit, his, earliest, known, painting, boy, with, a, basket, of, fruit, and, young, sick, bacchus, supposedly, a, self, portrait, done, during, convalescence, from, a, serious, illness, that, ended, his, employment, with, cesari, all, three, demonstrate, the, physical, particularity, for, which, caravaggio, was, to, become, renowned, the, fruit, basket, boy, s, produce, has, been, analyzed, by, a, professor, of, horticulture, who, was, able, to, identify, individual, cultivars, right, down, to, a, large, fig, leaf, with, a, prominent, fungal, scorch, lesion, resembling, anthracnose, glomerella, cingulata, caravaggio, left, cesari, determined, to, make, his, own, way, after, a, heated, argument, at, this, point, he, forged, some, extremely, important, friendships, with, the, painter, prospero, orsi, the, architect, onorio, longhi, and, the, sixteen, year, old, sicilian, artist, mario, minniti, orsi, established, in, the, profession, introduced, him, to, influential, collectors, longhi, more, balefully, introduced, him, to, the, world, of, roman, street, brawls, minniti, served, caravaggio, as, a, model, and, years, later, would, be, instrumental, in, helping, him, to, obtain, important, commissions, in, sicily, ostensibly, the, first, archival, reference, to, caravaggio, in, a, contemporary, document, from, rome, is, the, listing, of, his, name, with, that, of, prospero, orsi, as, his, partner, as, an, assistant, in, a, procession, in, october, 1594, in, honour, of, st, luke, the, earliest, informative, account, of, his, life, in, the, city, is, a, court, transcript, dated, 11, july, 1597, when, caravaggio, and, prospero, orsi, were, witnesses, to, a, crime, near, san, luigi, de, francesi, the, fortune, teller, his, first, composition, with, more, than, one, figure, shows, a, boy, likely, minniti, having, his, palm, read, by, a, romani, girl, who, is, stealthily, removing, his, ring, as, she, strokes, his, hand, the, theme, was, quite, new, for, rome, and, proved, immensely, influential, over, the, next, century, and, beyond, however, at, the, time, caravaggio, sold, it, for, practically, nothing, the, cardsharps, showing, another, na, ve, youth, of, privilege, falling, victim, to, card, cheats, is, even, more, psychologically, complex, and, perhaps, caravaggio, s, first, true, masterpiece, like, the, fortune, teller, it, was, immensely, popular, and, over, 50, copies, survived, more, importantly, it, attracted, the, patronage, of, cardinal, francesco, maria, del, monte, one, of, the, leading, connoisseurs, in, rome, for, del, monte, and, his, wealthy, art, loving, circle, caravaggio, executed, a, number, of, intimate, chamber, pieces, the, musicians, the, lute, player, a, tipsy, bacchus, and, an, allegorical, but, realistic, boy, bitten, by, a, lizard, featuring, minniti, and, other, adolescent, models, caravaggio, s, first, paintings, on, religious, themes, returned, to, realism, and, the, emergence, of, remarkable, spirituality, the, first, of, these, was, the, penitent, magdalene, showing, mary, magdalene, at, the, moment, when, she, has, turned, from, her, life, as, a, courtesan, and, sits, weeping, on, the, floor, her, jewels, scattered, around, her, it, seemed, not, a, religious, painting, at, all, a, girl, sitting, on, a, low, wooden, stool, drying, her, hair, where, was, the, repentance, suffering, promise, of, salvation, it, was, understated, in, the, lombard, manner, not, histrionic, in, the, roman, manner, of, the, time, it, was, followed, by, others, in, the, same, style, saint, catherine, martha, and, mary, magdalene, judith, beheading, holofernes, sacrifice, of, isaac, saint, francis, of, assisi, in, ecstasy, and, rest, on, the, flight, into, egypt, these, works, while, viewed, by, a, comparatively, limited, circle, increased, caravaggio, s, fame, with, both, connoisseurs, and, his, fellow, artists, but, a, true, reputation, would, depend, on, public, commissions, for, which, it, was, necessary, to, look, to, the, church, already, evident, was, the, intense, realism, or, naturalism, for, which, caravaggio, is, now, famous, he, preferred, to, paint, his, subjects, as, the, eye, sees, them, with, all, their, natural, flaws, and, defects, instead, of, as, idealised, creations, this, allowed, a, full, display, of, his, virtuosic, talents, this, shift, from, accepted, standard, practice, and, the, classical, idealism, of, michelangelo, was, very, controversial, at, the, time, caravaggio, also, dispensed, with, the, lengthy, preparations, for, a, painting, that, were, traditional, in, central, italy, at, the, time, instead, he, preferred, the, venetian, practice, of, working, in, oils, directly, from, the, subject, half, length, figures, and, still, life, supper, at, emmaus, from, c, 1600, 1601, is, a, characteristic, work, of, this, period, demonstrating, his, virtuoso, talent, in, 1599, presumably, through, the, influence, of, del, monte, caravaggio, was, contracted, to, decorate, the, contarelli, chapel, in, the, church, of, san, luigi, dei, francesi, the, two, works, making, up, the, commission, the, martyrdom, of, saint, matthew, and, the, calling, of, saint, matthew, delivered, in, 1600, were, an, immediate, sensation, thereafter, he, never, lacked, commissions, or, patrons, caravaggio, s, tenebrism, a, heightened, chiaroscuro, brought, high, drama, to, his, subjects, while, his, acutely, observed, realism, brought, a, new, level, of, emotional, intensity, opinion, among, his, artist, peers, was, polarized, some, denounced, him, for, various, perceived, failings, notably, his, insistence, on, painting, from, life, without, drawings, but, for, the, most, part, he, was, hailed, as, a, great, artistic, visionary, the, painters, then, in, rome, were, greatly, taken, by, this, novelty, and, the, young, ones, particularly, gathered, around, him, praised, him, as, the, unique, imitator, of, nature, and, looked, on, his, work, as, miracles, caravaggio, went, on, to, secure, a, string, of, prestigious, commissions, for, religious, works, featuring, violent, struggles, grotesque, decapitations, torture, and, death, most, notable, and, technically, masterful, among, them, were, the, incredulity, of, saint, thomas, circa, 1601, and, the, taking, of, christ, circa, 1602, for, the, mattei, family, which, were, only, rediscovered, in, the, 1990s, in, trieste, and, in, dublin, after, remaining, unrecognized, for, two, centuries, for, the, most, part, each, new, painting, increased, his, fame, but, a, few, were, rejected, by, the, various, bodies, for, whom, they, were, intended, at, least, in, their, original, forms, and, had, to, be, re, painted, or, find, new, buyers, the, essence, of, the, problem, was, that, while, caravaggio, s, dramatic, intensity, was, appreciated, his, realism, was, seen, by, some, as, unacceptably, vulgar, his, first, version, of, saint, matthew, and, the, angel, featuring, the, saint, as, a, bald, peasant, with, dirty, legs, attended, by, a, lightly, clad, over, familiar, boy, angel, was, rejected, and, a, second, version, had, to, be, painted, as, the, inspiration, of, saint, matthew, similarly, the, conversion, of, saint, paul, was, rejected, and, while, another, version, of, the, same, subject, the, conversion, on, the, way, to, damascus, was, accepted, it, featured, the, saint, s, horse, s, haunches, far, more, prominently, than, the, saint, himself, prompting, this, exchange, between, the, artist, and, an, exasperated, official, of, santa, maria, del, popolo, why, have, you, put, a, horse, in, the, middle, and, saint, paul, on, the, ground, because, is, the, horse, god, no, but, he, stands, in, god, s, light, the, aristocratic, collector, ciriaco, mattei, brother, of, cardinal, girolamo, mattei, who, was, friends, with, cardinal, francesco, maria, bourbon, del, monte, gave, the, supper, at, emmaus, to, the, city, palace, he, shared, with, his, brother, 1601, national, gallery, london, the, incredulity, of, saint, thomas, c, 1601, ecclesiastical, version, private, collection, florence, the, incredulity, of, saint, thomas, c, 1601, 1601, secular, version, sanssouci, palace, potsdam, john, the, baptist, with, the, ram, 1602, capitoline, museums, rome, and, the, taking, of, christ, 1602, national, gallery, of, ireland, dublin, caravaggio, commissioned, the, second, version, of, the, taking, of, christ, which, was, looted, from, the, odessa, museum, in, 2008, and, recovered, in, 2010, is, believed, by, some, experts, to, be, a, contemporary, copy, the, incredulity, of, saint, thomas, is, one, of, the, most, famous, paintings, by, caravaggio, circa, 1601, 1602, there, are, two, autograph, versions, of, the, painting, the, ecclesiastical, trieste, version, for, girolamo, mattei, now, in, a, private, collection, and, the, secular, potsdam, version, for, vincenzo, giustiniani, pietro, bellori, which, later, entered, the, prussian, royal, collection, survived, the, second, world, war, unscathed, and, can, be, viewed, in, the, palais, in, sanssouci, potsdam, the, painting, depicts, the, episode, that, led, to, the, term, doubting, thomas, in, art, history, formally, known, as, the, incredulity, of, saint, thomas, which, has, been, frequently, depicted, and, used, to, make, various, theological, statements, in, christian, art, since, at, least, the, 5th, century, according, to, the, gospel, of, john, thomas, the, apostle, missed, one, of, jesus, appearances, to, the, apostles, after, his, resurrection, and, said, unless, i, see, the, marks, of, the, nails, in, his, hands, and, put, my, finger, where, the, nails, were, and, put, my, hand, into, his, side, i, will, not, believe, it, a, week, later, jesus, appeared, and, told, thomas, to, touch, him, and, stop, doubting, then, jesus, said, because, you, have, seen, me, you, have, believed, blessed, are, those, who, have, not, seen, and, yet, have, believed, both, versions, of, the, painting, show, in, a, demonstrative, gesture, how, the, doubting, apostle, puts, his, finger, into, christ, s, side, wound, the, latter, guiding, his, hand, the, unbeliever, is, depicted, like, a, peasant, dressed, in, a, robe, torn, at, the, shoulder, and, with, dirt, under, his, fingernails, the, composition, of, the, picture, is, designed, in, such, a, way, that, the, viewer, is, directly, involved, in, the, event, and, feels, the, intensity, of, the, event, it, should, also, be, noted, that, in, the, ecclesiastical, version, of, the, unbelieving, thomas, christ, s, thigh, is, shown, to, be, covered, whereas, in, the, secular, version, of, the, painting, christ, s, thigh, is, visible, other, works, included, entombment, the, madonna, di, loreto, madonna, of, the, pilgrims, the, grooms, madonna, and, death, of, the, virgin, the, history, of, these, last, two, paintings, illustrates, the, reception, given, to, some, of, caravaggio, s, art, and, the, times, in, which, he, lived, the, grooms, madonna, also, known, as, madonna, dei, palafrenieri, painted, for, a, small, altar, in, saint, peter, s, basilica, in, rome, remained, there, for, just, two, days, and, was, then, removed, a, cardinal, s, secretary, wrote, in, this, painting, there, are, but, vulgarity, sacrilege, impiousness, and, disgust, one, would, say, it, is, a, work, made, by, a, painter, that, can, paint, well, but, of, a, dark, spirit, and, who, has, been, for, a, lot, of, time, far, from, god, from, his, adoration, and, from, any, good, thought, death, of, the, virgin, commissioned, in, 1601, by, a, wealthy, jurist, for, his, private, chapel, in, the, new, carmelite, church, of, santa, maria, della, scala, was, rejected, by, the, carmelites, in, 1606, caravaggio, s, contemporary, giulio, mancini, records, that, it, was, rejected, because, caravaggio, had, used, a, well, known, prostitute, as, his, model, for, the, virgin, giovanni, baglione, another, contemporary, tells, that, it, was, due, to, mary, s, bare, legs, a, matter, of, decorum, in, either, case, caravaggio, scholar, john, gash, suggests, that, the, problem, for, the, carmelites, may, have, been, theological, rather, than, aesthetic, in, that, caravaggio, s, version, fails, to, assert, the, doctrine, of, the, assumption, of, mary, the, idea, that, the, mother, of, god, did, not, die, in, any, ordinary, sense, but, was, assumed, into, heaven, the, replacement, altarpiece, commissioned, from, one, of, caravaggio, s, most, able, followers, carlo, saraceni, showed, the, virgin, not, dead, as, caravaggio, had, painted, her, but, seated, and, dying, and, even, this, was, rejected, and, replaced, with, a, work, showing, the, virgin, not, dying, but, ascending, into, heaven, with, choirs, of, angels, in, any, case, the, rejection, did, not, mean, that, caravaggio, or, his, paintings, were, out, of, favour, death, of, the, virgin, was, no, sooner, taken, out, of, the, church, than, it, was, purchased, by, the, duke, of, mantua, on, the, advice, of, rubens, and, later, acquired, by, charles, i, of, england, before, entering, the, french, royal, collection, in, 1671, one, secular, piece, from, these, years, is, amor, vincit, omnia, in, english, also, called, amor, victorious, painted, in, 1602, for, vincenzo, giustiniani, a, member, of, del, monte, s, circle, the, model, was, named, in, a, memoir, of, the, early, 17th, century, as, cecco, the, diminutive, for, francesco, he, is, possibly, francesco, boneri, identified, with, an, artist, active, in, the, period, 1610, 1625, and, known, as, cecco, del, caravaggio, caravaggio, s, cecco, carrying, a, bow, and, arrows, and, trampling, symbols, of, the, warlike, and, peaceful, arts, and, sciences, underfoot, he, is, unclothed, and, it, is, difficult, to, accept, this, grinning, urchin, as, the, roman, god, cupid, as, difficult, as, it, was, to, accept, caravaggio, s, other, semi, clad, adolescents, as, the, various, angels, he, painted, in, his, canvases, wearing, much, the, same, stage, prop, wings, the, point, however, is, the, intense, yet, ambiguous, reality, of, the, work, it, is, simultaneously, cupid, and, cecco, as, caravaggio, s, virgins, were, simultaneously, the, mother, of, christ, and, the, roman, courtesans, who, modeled, for, them, caravaggio, led, a, tumultuous, life, he, was, notorious, for, brawling, even, in, a, time, and, place, when, such, behavior, was, commonplace, and, the, transcripts, of, his, police, records, and, trial, proceedings, fill, many, pages, bellori, claims, that, around, 1590, 1592, caravaggio, already, well, known, for, brawling, with, gangs, of, young, men, committed, a, murder, which, forced, him, to, flee, from, milan, first, to, venice, and, then, to, rome, on, 28, november, 1600, while, living, at, the, palazzo, madama, with, his, patron, cardinal, del, monte, caravaggio, beat, nobleman, girolamo, stampa, da, montepulciano, a, guest, of, the, cardinal, with, a, club, resulting, in, an, official, complaint, to, the, police, episodes, of, brawling, violence, and, tumult, grew, more, and, more, frequent, caravaggio, was, often, arrested, and, jailed, at, tor, di, nona, after, his, release, from, jail, in, 1601, caravaggio, returned, to, paint, first, the, taking, of, christ, and, then, amor, vincit, omnia, in, 1603, he, was, arrested, again, this, time, for, the, defamation, of, another, painter, giovanni, baglione, who, sued, caravaggio, and, his, followers, orazio, gentileschi, and, onorio, longhi, for, writing, offensive, poems, about, him, the, french, ambassador, intervened, and, caravaggio, was, transferred, to, house, arrest, after, a, month, in, jail, in, tor, di, nona, between, may, and, october, 1604, caravaggio, was, arrested, several, times, for, possession, of, illegal, weapons, and, for, insulting, the, city, guards, he, was, also, sued, by, a, tavern, waiter, for, having, thrown, a, plate, of, artichokes, in, his, face, an, early, published, notice, on, caravaggio, dating, from, 1604, and, describing, his, lifestyle, three, years, previously, recounts, that, after, a, fortnight, s, work, he, will, swagger, about, for, a, month, or, two, with, a, sword, at, his, side, and, a, servant, following, him, from, one, ball, court, to, the, next, ever, ready, to, engage, in, a, fight, or, an, argument, so, that, it, is, most, awkward, to, get, along, with, him, in, 1605, caravaggio, was, forced, to, flee, to, genoa, for, three, weeks, after, seriously, injuring, mariano, pasqualone, di, accumoli, a, notary, in, a, dispute, over, lena, caravaggio, s, model, and, lover, the, notary, reported, having, been, attacked, on, 29, july, with, a, sword, causing, a, severe, head, injury, caravaggio, s, patrons, intervened, and, managed, to, cover, up, the, incident, upon, his, return, to, rome, caravaggio, was, sued, by, his, landlady, prudenzia, bruni, for, not, having, paid, his, rent, out, of, spite, caravaggio, threw, rocks, through, her, window, at, night, and, was, sued, again, in, november, caravaggio, was, hospitalized, for, an, injury, which, he, claimed, he, had, caused, himself, by, falling, on, his, own, sword, on, 29, may, 1606, caravaggio, killed, a, young, man, possibly, unintentionally, resulting, in, his, fleeing, rome, with, a, death, sentence, hanging, over, him, ranuccio, tomassoni, was, a, gangster, from, a, wealthy, family, the, two, had, argued, many, times, often, ending, in, blows, the, circumstances, are, unclear, whether, a, brawl, or, a, duel, with, swords, at, campo, marzio, but, the, killing, may, have, been, unintentional, many, rumors, circulated, at, the, time, as, to, the, cause, of, the, fight, several, contemporary, avvisi, referred, to, a, quarrel, over, a, gambling, debt, and, a, pallacorda, game, a, sort, of, tennis, and, this, explanation, has, become, established, in, the, popular, imagination, other, rumors, however, claimed, that, the, duel, stemmed, from, jealousy, over, fillide, melandroni, a, well, known, roman, prostitute, who, had, modeled, for, him, in, several, important, paintings, tomassoni, was, her, pimp, according, to, such, rumors, caravaggio, castrated, tomassoni, with, his, sword, before, deliberately, killing, him, with, other, versions, claiming, that, tomassoni, s, death, had, been, caused, accidentally, during, the, castration, the, duel, may, have, had, a, political, dimension, as, tomassoni, s, family, was, notoriously, pro, spanish, whereas, caravaggio, was, a, client, of, the, french, ambassador, caravaggio, s, patrons, had, hitherto, been, able, to, shield, him, from,

to, protect, him, caravaggio, was, sentenced, to, beheading, for, murder, and, an, open, bounty, was, decreed, enabling, anyone, who, recognized, him, to, carry, out, the, sentence, legally, caravaggio, s, paintings, began, obsessively, to, depict, severed, heads, often, his, own, at, this, time, good, modern, accounts, are, to, be, found, in, peter, robb, s, m, and, helen, langdon, s,

details, it, was, a, serious, matter, caravaggio, was, forced, to, flee, rome, he, moved, just, south, of, the, city, then, to, naples, malta, and, sicily, following, the, death, of, tomassoni, caravaggio, fled, first, to, the, estates, of, the, colonna, family, south, of, rome, and, then, on, to, naples, where, costanza, colonna, sforza, widow, of, francesco, sforza, in, whose, husband, s, household, caravaggio, s, father, had, held, a, position, maintained, a, palace, in, naples, outside, the, jurisdiction, of, the, roman, authorities, and, protected, by, the, colonna, family, the, most, famous, painter, in, rome, became, the, most, famous, in, naples, his, connections, with, the, colonnas, led, to, a, stream, of, important, church, commissions, including, the, madonna, of, the, rosary, and, the, seven, works, of, mercy, the, seven, works, of, mercy, depicts, the, seven, corporal, works, of, mercy, as, a, set, of, compassionate, acts, concerning, the, material, needs, of, others, the, painting, was, made, for, and, is, still, housed, in, the, church, of, pio, monte, della, misericordia, in, naples, caravaggio, combined, all, seven, works, of, mercy, in, one, composition, which, became, the, church, s, altarpiece, alessandro, giardino, has, also, established, the, connection, between, the, iconography, of, the, seven, works, of, mercy, and, the, cultural, scientific, and, philosophical, circles, of, the, painting, s, commissioners, despite, his, success, in, naples, after, only, a, few, months, in, the, city, caravaggio, left, for, malta, the, headquarters, of, the, knights, of, malta, fabrizio, sforza, colonna, costanza, s, son, was, a, knight, of, malta, and, general, of, the, order, s, galleys, he, appears, to, have, facilitated, caravaggio, s, arrival, on, the, island, in, 1607, and, his, escape, the, next, year, caravaggio, presumably, hoped, that, the, patronage, of, alof, de, wignacourt, grand, master, of, the, knights, of, saint, john, could, help, him, secure, a, pardon, for, tomassoni, s, death, wignacourt, was, so, impressed, at, having, the, famous, artist, as, official, painter, to, the, order, that, he, inducted, him, as, a, knight, and, the, early, biographer, bellori, records, that, the, artist, was, well, pleased, with, his, success, major, works, from, his, malta, period, include, the, beheading, of, saint, john, the, baptist, his, largest, ever, work, and, the, only, painting, to, which, he, put, his, signature, saint, jerome, writing, both, housed, in, saint, john, s, co, cathedral, valletta, malta, and, a, portrait, of, alof, de, wignacourt, and, his, page, as, well, as, portraits, of, other, leading, knights, according, to, andrea, pomella, the, beheading, of, saint, john, the, baptist, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, most, important, works, in, western, painting, completed, in, 1608, the, painting, had, been, commissioned, by, the, knights, of, malta, as, an, altarpiece, and, measuring, 370, by, 520, centimetres, 145, in, 205, in, was, the, largest, altarpiece, caravaggio, painted, it, still, hangs, in, st, john, s, co, cathedral, for, which, it, was, commissioned, and, where, caravaggio, himself, was, inducted, and, briefly, served, as, a, knight, yet, by, late, august, 1608, he, was, arrested, and, imprisoned, likely, the, result, of, yet, another, brawl, this, time, with, an, aristocratic, knight, during, which, the, door, of, a, house, was, battered, down, and, the, knight, seriously, wounded, caravaggio, was, imprisoned, by, the, knights, at, valletta, but, he, managed, to, escape, by, december, he, had, been, expelled, from, the, order, as, a, foul, and, rotten, member, a, formal, phrase, used, in, all, such, cases, caravaggio, made, his, way, to, sicily, where, he, met, his, old, friend, mario, minniti, who, was, now, married, and, living, in, syracuse, together, they, set, off, on, what, amounted, to, a, triumphal, tour, from, syracuse, to, messina, and, maybe, on, to, the, island, capital, palermo, in, syracuse, and, messina, caravaggio, continued, to, win, prestigious, and, well, paid, commissions, among, other, works, from, this, period, are, burial, of, st, lucy, the, raising, of, lazarus, and, adoration, of, the, shepherds, his, style, continued, to, evolve, showing, now, friezes, of, figures, isolated, against, vast, empty, backgrounds, his, great, sicilian, altarpieces, isolate, their, shadowy, pitifully, poor, figures, in, vast, areas, of, darkness, they, suggest, the, desperate, fears, and, frailty, of, man, and, at, the, same, time, convey, with, a, new, yet, desolate, tenderness, the, beauty, of, humility, and, of, the, meek, who, shall, inherit, the, earth, contemporary, reports, depict, a, man, whose, behaviour, was, becoming, increasingly, bizarre, which, included, sleeping, fully, armed, and, in, his, clothes, ripping, up, a, painting, at, a, slight, word, of, criticism, and, mocking, local, painters, caravaggio, displayed, bizarre, behaviour, from, very, early, in, his, career, mancini, describes, him, as, extremely, crazy, a, letter, from, del, monte, notes, his, strangeness, and, minniti, s, 1724, biographer, says, that, mario, left, caravaggio, because, of, his, behaviour, the, strangeness, seems, to, have, increased, after, malta, susinno, s, early, 18th, century, le, vite, de, pittori, messinesi, lives, of, the, painters, of, messina, provides, several, colourful, anecdotes, of, caravaggio, s, erratic, behaviour, in, sicily, and, these, are, reproduced, in, modern, full, length, biographies, such, as, langdon, and, robb, bellori, writes, of, caravaggio, s, fear, driving, him, from, city, to, city, across, the, island, and, finally, feeling, that, it, was, no, longer, safe, to, remain, back, to, naples, baglione, says, caravaggio, was, being, chased, by, his, enemy, but, like, bellori, does, not, say, who, this, enemy, was, after, only, nine, months, in, sicily, caravaggio, returned, to, naples, in, the, late, summer, of, 1609, according, to, his, earliest, biographer, he, was, being, pursued, by, enemies, while, in, sicily, and, felt, it, safest, to, place, himself, under, the, protection, of, the, colonnas, until, he, could, secure, his, pardon, from, the, pope, now, paul, v, and, return, to, rome, in, naples, he, painted, the, denial, of, saint, peter, a, final, john, the, baptist, borghese, and, his, last, picture, the, martyrdom, of, saint, ursula, his, style, continued, to, evolve, saint, ursula, is, caught, in, a, moment, of, highest, action, and, drama, as, the, arrow, fired, by, the, king, of, the, huns, strikes, her, in, the, breast, unlike, earlier, paintings, that, had, all, the, immobility, of, the, posed, models, the, brushwork, was, also, much, freer, and, more, impressionistic, in, october, 1609, he, was, involved, in, a, violent, clash, an, attempt, on, his, life, perhaps, ambushed, by, men, in, the, pay, of, the, knight, he, had, wounded, in, malta, or, some, other, faction, of, the, order, his, face, was, seriously, disfigured, and, rumours, circulated, in, rome, that, he, was, dead, he, painted, a, salome, with, the, head, of, john, the, baptist, madrid, showing, his, own, head, on, a, platter, and, sent, it, to, wignacourt, as, a, plea, for, forgiveness, perhaps, at, this, time, he, also, painted, a, david, with, the, head, of, goliath, showing, the, young, david, with, a, strangely, sorrowful, expression, gazing, at, the, severed, head, of, the, giant, which, is, again, caravaggio, this, painting, he, may, have, sent, to, his, patron, the, unscrupulous, art, loving, cardinal, scipione, borghese, nephew, of, the, pope, who, had, the, power, to, grant, or, withhold, pardons, caravaggio, hoped, borghese, could, mediate, a, pardon, in, exchange, for, works, by, the, artist, news, from, rome, encouraged, caravaggio, and, in, the, summer, of, 1610, he, took, a, boat, northwards, to, receive, the, pardon, which, seemed, imminent, thanks, to, his, powerful, roman, friends, with, him, were, three, last, paintings, the, gifts, for, cardinal, scipione, what, happened, next, is, the, subject, of, much, confusion, and, conjecture, shrouded, in, much, mystery, the, bare, facts, seem, to, be, that, on, 28, july, an, anonymous, avviso, private, newsletter, from, rome, to, the, ducal, court, of, urbino, reported, that, caravaggio, was, dead, three, days, later, another, avviso, said, that, he, had, died, of, fever, on, his, way, from, naples, to, rome, a, poet, friend, of, the, artist, later, gave, 18, july, as, the, date, of, death, and, a, recent, researcher, claims, to, have, discovered, a, death, notice, showing, that, the, artist, died, on, that, day, of, a, fever, in, porto, ercole, near, grosseto, in, tuscany, caravaggio, had, a, fever, at, the, time, of, his, death, and, what, killed, him, was, a, matter, of, controversy, and, rumour, at, the, time, and, has, been, a, matter, of, historical, debate, and, study, since, contemporary, rumors, held, that, either, the, tomassoni, family, or, the, knights, had, him, killed, in, revenge, traditionally, historians, have, long, thought, he, died, of, syphilis, some, have, said, he, had, malaria, or, possibly, brucellosis, from, unpasteurised, dairy, some, scholars, have, argued, that, caravaggio, was, actually, attacked, and, killed, by, the, same, enemies, that, had, been, pursuing, him, since, he, fled, malta, possibly, wignacourt, or, factions, of, the, knights, caravaggio, s, remains, were, buried, in, porto, ercole, s, san, sebastiano, cemetery, which, closed, in, 1956, and, then, moved, to, st, erasmus, cemetery, where, in, 2010, archaeologists, conducted, a, year, long, investigation, of, remains, found, in, three, crypts, and, after, using, dna, carbon, dating, and, other, methods, believe, with, a, high, degree, of, confidence, that, they, have, identified, those, of, caravaggio, initial, tests, suggested, caravaggio, might, have, died, of, lead, poisoning, paints, used, at, the, time, contained, high, amounts, of, lead, salts, and, caravaggio, is, known, to, have, indulged, in, violent, behavior, as, caused, by, lead, poisoning, later, research, concluded, he, died, as, the, result, of, a, wound, sustained, in, a, brawl, in, naples, specifically, from, sepsis, caused, by, staphylococcus, aureus, vatican, documents, released, in, 2002, support, the, theory, that, the, wealthy, tomassoni, family, had, him, hunted, down, and, killed, as, a, vendetta, for, caravaggio, s, murder, of, gangster, ranuccio, tomassoni, in, a, botched, attempt, at, castration, after, a, duel, over, the, affections, of, model, fillide, melandroni, since, the, 1970s, art, scholars, and, historians, have, debated, the, inferences, of, homoeroticism, in, caravaggio, s, works, as, a, way, to, better, understand, the, man, caravaggio, never, married, and, had, no, known, children, and, howard, hibbard, observed, the, absence, of, erotic, female, figures, in, the, artist, s, oeuvre, in, his, entire, career, he, did, not, paint, a, single, female, nude, and, the, cabinet, pieces, from, the, del, monte, period, are, replete, with, full, lipped, languorous, boys, who, seem, to, solicit, the, onlooker, with, their, offers, of, fruit, wine, flowers, and, themselves, suggesting, an, erotic, interest, in, the, male, form, the, model, of, amor, vincit, omnia, cecco, del, caravaggio, lived, with, the, artist, in, rome, and, stayed, with, him, even, after, he, was, obliged, to, leave, the, city, in, 1606, the, two, may, have, been, lovers, a, connection, with, a, certain, lena, is, mentioned, in, a, 1605, court, deposition, by, pasqualone, where, she, is, described, as, michelangelo, s, girl, according, to, g, b, passeri, this, lena, was, caravaggio, s, model, for, the, madonna, di, loreto, and, according, to, catherine, puglisi, lena, may, have, been, the, same, person, as, the, courtesan, maddalena, di, paolo, antognetti, who, named, caravaggio, as, an, intimate, friend, by, her, own, testimony, in, 1604, caravaggio, was, also, rumored, to, be, madly, in, love, with, fillide, melandroni, a, well, known, roman, prostitute, who, modeled, for, him, in, several, important, paintings, caravaggio, s, sexuality, also, received, early, speculation, due, to, claims, about, the, artist, by, honor, gabriel, riqueti, comte, de, mirabeau, writing, in, 1783, mirabeau, contrasted, the, personal, life, of, caravaggio, directly, with, the, writings, of, st, paul, in, the, book, of, romans, arguing, that, romans, excessively, practice, sodomy, or, homosexuality, the, holy, mother, catholic, church, teachings, on, morality, and, so, on, short, book, title, contains, the, latin, phrase, et, f, min, eorum, immutaverunt, naturalem, usum, in, eum, usum, qui, est, contra, naturam, and, their, women, changed, their, natural, habit, to, that, which, is, against, nature, the, phrase, according, to, mirabeau, entered, caravaggio, s, thoughts, and, he, claimed, that, such, an, abomination, could, be, witnessed, through, a, particular, painting, housed, at, the, museum, of, the, grand, duke, of, tuscany, featuring, a, rosary, of, a, blasphemous, nature, in, which, a, circle, of, thirty, men, turpiter, ligati, are, intertwined, in, embrace, and, presented, in, unbridled, composition, mirabeau, notes, the, affectionate, nature, of, caravaggio, s, depiction, reflects, the, voluptuous, glow, of, the, artist, s, sexuality, by, the, late, nineteenth, century, sir, richard, francis, burton, identified, the, painting, as, caravaggio, s, painting, of, st, rosario, burton, also, identifies, both, st, rosario, and, this, painting, with, the, practices, of, tiberius, mentioned, by, seneca, the, younger, the, survival, status, and, location, of, caravaggio, s, painting, is, unknown, no, such, painting, appears, in, his, or, his, school, s, catalogues, aside, from, the, paintings, evidence, also, comes, from, the, libel, trial, brought, against, caravaggio, by, giovanni, baglione, in, 1603, baglione, accused, caravaggio, and, his, friends, of, writing, and, distributing, scurrilous, doggerel, attacking, him, the, pamphlets, according, to, baglione, s, friend, and, witness, mao, salini, had, been, distributed, by, a, certain, giovanni, battista, a, bardassa, or, boy, prostitute, shared, by, caravaggio, and, his, friend, onorio, longhi, caravaggio, denied, knowing, any, young, boy, of, that, name, and, the, allegation, was, not, followed, up, baglione, s, painting, of, divine, love, has, also, been, seen, as, a, visual, accusation, of, sodomy, against, caravaggio, such, accusations, were, damaging, and, dangerous, as, sodomy, was, a, capital, crime, at, the, time, even, though, the, authorities, were, unlikely, to, investigate, such, a, well, connected, person, as, caravaggio, once, an, artist, had, been, smeared, as, a, pederast, his, work, was, smeared, too, francesco, susino, in, his, later, biography, additionally, relates, the, story, of, how, the, artist, was, chased, by, a, schoolmaster, in, sicily, for, spending, too, long, gazing, at, the, boys, in, his, care, susino, presents, it, as, a, misunderstanding, but, some, authors, have, speculated, that, caravaggio, may, indeed, have, been, seeking, sex, with, the, boys, using, the, incident, to, explain, some, of, his, paintings, which, they, believe, to, be, homoerotic, the, art, historian, andrew, graham, dixon, has, summarised, the, debate, a, lot, has, been, made, of, caravaggio, s, presumed, homosexuality, which, has, in, more, than, one, previous, account, of, his, life, been, presented, as, the, single, key, that, explains, everything, both, the, power, of, his, art, and, the, misfortunes, of, his, life, there, is, no, absolute, proof, of, it, only, strong, circumstantial, evidence, and, much, rumour, the, balance, of, probability, suggests, that, caravaggio, did, indeed, have, sexual, relations, with, men, but, he, certainly, had, female, lovers, throughout, the, years, that, he, spent, in, rome, he, kept, close, company, with, a, number, of, prostitutes, the, truth, is, that, caravaggio, was, as, uneasy, in, his, relationships, as, he, was, in, most, other, aspects, of, life, he, likely, slept, with, men, he, did, sleep, with, women, he, settled, with, no, one, the, idea, that, he, was, an, early, martyr, to, the, drives, of, an, unconventional, sexuality, is, an, anachronistic, fiction, washington, post, art, critic, philip, kennicott, has, taken, issue, with, what, he, regarded, as, graham, dixon, s, minimizing, of, caravaggio, s, homosexuality, there, was, a, fussiness, to, the, tone, whenever, a, scholar, or, curator, was, forced, to, grapple, with, transgressive, sexuality, and, you, can, still, find, it, even, in, relatively, recent, histories, including, andrew, graham, dixon, s, 2010, biography, of, caravaggio, which, acknowledges, only, that, he, likely, slept, with, men, the, author, notes, the, artist, s, fluid, sexual, desires, but, gives, some, of, caravaggio, s, most, explicitly, homoerotic, paintings, tortured, readings, to, keep, them, safely, in, the, category, of, mere, ambiguity, caravaggio, put, the, oscuro, shadows, into, chiaroscuro, chiaroscuro, was, practised, long, before, he, came, on, the, scene, but, it, was, caravaggio, who, made, the, technique, a, dominant, stylistic, element, darkening, the, shadows, and, transfixing, the, subject, in, a, blinding, shaft, of, light, with, this, came, the, acute, observation, of, physical, and, psychological, reality, that, formed, the, ground, both, for, his, immense, popularity, and, for, his, frequent, problems, with, his, religious, commissions, he, worked, at, great, speed, from, live, models, scoring, basic, guides, directly, onto, the, canvas, with, the, end, of, the, brush, handle, very, few, of, caravaggio, s, drawings, appear, to, have, survived, and, it, is, likely, that, he, preferred, to, work, directly, on, the, canvas, an, unusual, approach, at, the, time, his, models, were, basic, to, his, realism, some, have, been, identified, including, mario, minniti, and, francesco, boneri, both, fellow, artists, minniti, appearing, as, various, figures, in, the, early, secular, works, the, young, boneri, as, a, succession, of, angels, baptists, and, davids, in, the, later, canvasses, his, female, models, include, fillide, melandroni, anna, bianchini, and, maddalena, antognetti, the, lena, mentioned, in, court, documents, of, the, artichoke, case, as, caravaggio, s, concubine, all, well, known, prostitutes, who, appear, as, female, religious, figures, including, the, virgin, and, various, saints, caravaggio, himself, appears, in, several, paintings, his, final, self, portrait, being, as, the, witness, on, the, far, right, to, the, martyrdom, of, saint, ursula, caravaggio, had, a, noteworthy, ability, to, express, in, one, scene, of, unsurpassed, vividness, the, passing, of, a, crucial, moment, the, supper, at, emmaus, depicts, the, recognition, of, christ, by, his, disciples, a, moment, before, he, is, a, fellow, traveller, mourning, the, passing, of, the, messiah, as, he, never, ceases, to, be, to, the, innkeeper, s, eyes, the, second, after, he, is, the, saviour, in, the, calling, of, st, matthew, the, hand, of, the, saint, points, to, himself, as, if, he, were, saying, who, me, while, his, eyes, fixed, upon, the, figure, of, christ, have, already, said, yes, i, will, follow, you, with, the, resurrection, of, lazarus, he, goes, a, step, further, giving, a, glimpse, of, the, actual, physical, process, of, resurrection, the, body, of, lazarus, is, still, in, the, throes, of, rigor, mortis, but, his, hand, facing, and, recognising, that, of, christ, is, alive, other, major, baroque, artists, would, travel, the, same, path, for, example, bernini, fascinated, with, themes, from, ovid, s, metamorphoses, the, installation, of, the, st, matthew, paintings, in, the, contarelli, chapel, had, an, immediate, impact, among, the, younger, artists, in, rome, and, caravaggism, became, the, cutting, edge, for, every, ambitious, young, painter, the, first, caravaggisti, included, orazio, gentileschi, and, giovanni, baglione, baglione, s, caravaggio, phase, was, short, lived, caravaggio, later, accused, him, of, plagiarism, and, the, two, were, involved, in, a, long, feud, baglione, went, on, to, write, the, first, biography, of, caravaggio, in, the, next, generation, of, caravaggisti, there, were, carlo, saraceni, bartolomeo, manfredi, and, orazio, borgianni, gentileschi, despite, being, considerably, older, was, the, only, one, of, these, artists, to, live, much, beyond, 1620, and, ended, up, as, a, court, painter, to, charles, i, of, england, his, daughter, artemisia, gentileschi, was, also, stylistically, close, to, caravaggio, and, one, of, the, most, gifted, of, the, movement, however, in, rome, and, italy, it, was, not, caravaggio, but, the, influence, of, his, rival, annibale, carracci, blending, elements, from, the, high, renaissance, and, lombard, realism, that, ultimately, triumphed, caravaggio, s, brief, stay, in, naples, produced, a, notable, school, of, neapolitan, caravaggisti, including, battistello, caracciolo, and, carlo, sellitto, the, caravaggisti, movement, there, ended, with, a, terrible, outbreak, of, plague, in, 1656, but, the, spanish, connection, naples, was, a, possession, of, spain, was, instrumental, in, forming, the, important, spanish, branch, of, his, influence, rubens, was, likely, one, of, the, first, flemish, artists, to, be, influenced, by, caravaggio, whose, work, he, got, to, know, during, his, stay, in, rome, in, 1601, he, later, painted, a, copy, or, rather, an, interpretation, of, caravaggio, s, entombment, of, christ, and, recommended, his, patron, the, duke, of, mantua, purchase, death, of, the, virgin, louvre, although, some, of, this, interest, in, caravaggio, is, reflected, in, his, drawings, during, his, italian, residence, it, was, only, after, his, return, to, antwerp, in, 1608, that, rubens, works, show, openly, caravaggesque, traits, such, as, in, the, cain, slaying, abel, 1608, 1609, courtauld, institute, of, art, and, the, old, woman, and, boy, with, candles, 1618, 1619, mauritshuis, however, the, influence, of, caravaggio, on, rubens, work, would, be, less, important, than, that, of, raphael, correggio, barocci, and, the, venetians, flemish, artists, who, were, influenced, by, rubens, such, as, jacob, jordaens, pieter, van, mol, gaspar, de, crayer, and, willem, jacob, herreyns, also, used, certain, stark, realism, and, strong, contrasts, of, light, and, shadow, common, to, the, caravaggesque, style, a, number, of, catholic, artists, from, utrecht, including, hendrick, ter, brugghen, gerrit, van, honthorst, and, dirck, van, baburen, travelled, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 17th, century, to, rome, here, they, became, profoundly, influenced, by, the, work, of, caravaggio, and, his, followers, on, their, return, to, utrecht, their, caravaggesque, works, inspired, a, short, lived, but, influential, flowering, of, artworks, inspired, indirectly, in, style, and, subject, matter, by, the, works, of, caravaggio, and, the, italian, followers, of, caravaggio, this, style, of, painting, was, later, referred, to, as, utrecht, caravaggism, in, the, following, generation, of, dutch, artists, the, effects, of, caravaggio, although, attenuated, are, to, be, seen, in, the, work, of, vermeer, and, rembrandt, neither, of, whom, visited, italy, caravaggio, s, innovations, inspired, the, baroque, but, the, baroque, took, the, drama, of, his, chiaroscuro, without, the, psychological, realism, while, he, directly, influenced, the, style, of, the, artists, mentioned, above, and, at, a, distance, the, frenchmen, georges, de, la, tour, and, simon, vouet, and, the, spaniard, giuseppe, ribera, within, a, few, decades, his, works, were, being, ascribed, to, less, scandalous, artists, or, simply, overlooked, the, baroque, to, which, he, contributed, so, much, had, evolved, and, fashions, had, changed, but, perhaps, more, pertinently, caravaggio, never, established, a, workshop, as, the, carracci, did, and, thus, had, no, school, to, spread, his, techniques, nor, did, he, ever, set, out, his, underlying, philosophical, approach, to, art, the, psychological, realism, that, may, only, be, deduced, from, his, surviving, work, thus, his, reputation, was, doubly, vulnerable, to, the,

school, led, by, the, carracci, baglione, his, first, biographer, played, a, considerable, part, in, creating, the, legend, of, caravaggio, s, unstable, and, violent, character, as, well, as, his,
