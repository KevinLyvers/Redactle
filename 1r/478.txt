sir, edward, william, elgar, 1st, baronet, om, gcvo, l, r, 2, june, 1857, 23, february, 1934, was, an, english, composer, many, of, whose, works, have, entered, the, british, and, international, classical, concert, repertoire, among, his, best, known, compositions, are, orchestral, works, including, the, enigma, variations, the, pomp, and, circumstance, marches, concertos, for, violin, and, cello, and, two, symphonies, he, also, composed, choral, works, including, the, dream, of, gerontius, chamber, music, and, songs, he, was, appointed, master, of, the, king, s, musick, in, 1924, although, elgar, is, often, regarded, as, a, typically, english, composer, most, of, his, musical, influences, were, not, from, england, but, from, continental, europe, he, felt, himself, to, be, an, outsider, not, only, musically, but, socially, in, musical, circles, dominated, by, academics, he, was, a, self, taught, composer, in, protestant, britain, his, roman, catholicism, was, regarded, with, suspicion, in, some, quarters, and, in, the, class, conscious, society, of, victorian, and, edwardian, britain, he, was, acutely, sensitive, about, his, humble, origins, even, after, he, achieved, recognition, he, nevertheless, married, the, daughter, of, a, senior, british, army, officer, she, inspired, him, both, musically, and, socially, but, he, struggled, to, achieve, success, until, his, forties, when, after, a, series, of, moderately, successful, works, his, enigma, variations, 1899, became, immediately, popular, in, britain, and, overseas, he, followed, the, variations, with, a, choral, work, the, dream, of, gerontius, 1900, based, on, a, roman, catholic, text, that, caused, some, disquiet, in, the, anglican, establishment, in, britain, but, it, became, and, has, remained, a, core, repertory, work, in, britain, and, elsewhere, his, later, full, length, religious, choral, works, were, well, received, but, have, not, entered, the, regular, repertory, in, his, fifties, elgar, composed, a, symphony, and, a, violin, concerto, that, were, immensely, successful, his, second, symphony, and, his, cello, concerto, did, not, gain, immediate, public, popularity, and, took, many, years, to, achieve, a, regular, place, in, the, concert, repertory, of, british, orchestras, elgar, s, music, came, in, his, later, years, to, be, seen, as, appealing, chiefly, to, british, audiences, his, stock, remained, low, for, a, generation, after, his, death, it, began, to, revive, significantly, in, the, 1960s, helped, by, new, recordings, of, his, works, some, of, his, works, have, in, recent, years, been, taken, up, again, internationally, but, the, music, continues, to, be, played, more, in, britain, than, elsewhere, elgar, has, been, described, as, the, first, composer, to, take, the, gramophone, seriously, between, 1914, and, 1925, he, conducted, a, series, of, acoustic, recordings, of, his, works, the, introduction, of, the, moving, coil, microphone, in, 1923, made, far, more, accurate, sound, reproduction, possible, and, elgar, made, new, recordings, of, most, of, his, major, orchestral, works, and, excerpts, from, the, dream, of, gerontius, edward, elgar, was, born, in, the, small, village, of, lower, broadheath, near, worcester, england, on, 2, june, 1857, his, father, william, henry, elgar, 1821, 1906, was, raised, in, dover, and, had, been, apprenticed, to, a, london, music, publisher, in, 1841, william, moved, to, worcester, where, he, worked, as, a, piano, tuner, and, set, up, a, shop, selling, sheet, music, and, musical, instruments, in, 1848, he, married, ann, greening, 1822, 1902, daughter, of, a, farm, worker, edward, was, the, fourth, of, their, seven, children, ann, elgar, had, converted, to, roman, catholicism, shortly, before, edward, s, birth, and, he, was, baptised, and, brought, up, as, a, roman, catholic, to, the, disapproval, of, his, father, william, elgar, was, a, violinist, of, professional, standard, and, held, the, post, of, organist, of, st, george, s, roman, catholic, church, worcester, from, 1846, to, 1885, at, his, instigation, masses, by, cherubini, and, hummel, were, first, heard, at, the, three, choirs, festival, by, the, orchestra, in, which, he, played, the, violin, all, the, elgar, children, received, a, musical, upbringing, by, the, age, of, eight, elgar, was, taking, piano, and, violin, lessons, and, his, father, who, tuned, the, pianos, at, many, grand, houses, in, worcestershire, would, sometimes, take, him, along, giving, him, the, chance, to, display, his, skill, to, important, local, figures, elgar, s, mother, was, interested, in, the, arts, and, encouraged, his, musical, development, he, inherited, from, her, a, discerning, taste, for, literature, and, a, passionate, love, of, the, countryside, his, friend, and, biographer, w, h, billy, reed, wrote, that, elgar, s, early, surroundings, had, an, influence, that, permeated, all, his, work, and, gave, to, his, whole, life, that, subtle, but, none, the, less, true, and, sturdy, english, quality, he, began, composing, at, an, early, age, for, a, play, written, and, acted, by, the, elgar, children, when, he, was, about, ten, he, wrote, music, that, forty, years, later, he, rearranged, with, only, minor, changes, and, orchestrated, as, the, suites, titled, the, wand, of, youth, until, he, was, fifteen, elgar, received, a, general, education, at, littleton, now, lyttleton, house, school, near, worcester, his, only, formal, musical, training, beyond, piano, and, violin, lessons, from, local, teachers, consisted, of, more, advanced, violin, studies, with, adolf, pollitzer, during, brief, visits, to, london, in, 1877, 78, elgar, said, my, first, music, was, learnt, in, the, cathedral, from, books, borrowed, from, the, music, library, when, i, was, eight, nine, or, ten, he, worked, through, manuals, of, instruction, on, organ, playing, and, read, every, book, he, could, find, on, the, theory, of, music, he, later, said, that, he, had, been, most, helped, by, hubert, parry, s, articles, in, the, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, elgar, began, to, learn, german, in, the, hope, of, going, to, the, leipzig, conservatory, for, further, musical, studies, but, his, father, could, not, afford, to, send, him, years, later, a, profile, in, the, musical, times, considered, that, his, failure, to, get, to, leipzig, was, fortunate, for, elgar, s, musical, development, thus, the, budding, composer, escaped, the, dogmatism, of, the, schools, however, it, was, a, disappointment, to, elgar, that, on, leaving, school, in, 1872, he, went, not, to, leipzig, but, to, the, office, of, a, local, solicitor, as, a, clerk, he, did, not, find, an, office, career, congenial, and, for, fulfilment, he, turned, not, only, to, music, but, to, literature, becoming, a, voracious, reader, around, this, time, he, made, his, first, public, appearances, as, a, violinist, and, organist, after, a, few, months, elgar, left, the, solicitor, to, embark, on, a, musical, career, giving, piano, and, violin, lessons, and, working, occasionally, in, his, father, s, shop, he, was, an, active, member, of, the, worcester, glee, club, along, with, his, father, and, he, accompanied, singers, played, the, violin, composed, and, arranged, works, and, conducted, for, the, first, time, pollitzer, believed, that, as, a, violinist, elgar, had, the, potential, to, be, one, of, the, leading, soloists, in, the, country, but, elgar, himself, having, heard, leading, virtuosi, at, london, concerts, felt, his, own, violin, playing, lacked, a, full, enough, tone, and, he, abandoned, his, ambitions, to, be, a, soloist, at, twenty, two, he, took, up, the, post, of, conductor, of, the, attendants, band, at, the, worcester, and, county, lunatic, asylum, in, powick, three, miles, five, km, from, worcester, the, band, consisted, of, piccolo, flute, clarinet, two, cornets, euphonium, three, or, four, first, and, a, similar, number, of, second, violins, occasional, viola, cello, double, bass, and, piano, elgar, coached, the, players, and, wrote, and, arranged, their, music, including, quadrilles, and, polkas, for, the, unusual, combination, of, instruments, the, musical, times, wrote, this, practical, experience, proved, to, be, of, the, greatest, value, to, the, young, musician, he, acquired, a, practical, knowledge, of, the, capabilities, of, these, different, instruments, he, thereby, got, to, know, intimately, the, tone, colour, the, ins, and, outs, of, these, and, many, other, instruments, he, held, the, post, for, five, years, from, 1879, travelling, to, powick, once, a, week, another, post, he, held, in, his, early, days, was, professor, of, the, violin, at, the, worcester, college, for, the, blind, sons, of, gentlemen, although, rather, solitary, and, introspective, by, nature, elgar, thrived, in, worcester, s, musical, circles, he, played, in, the, violins, at, the, worcester, and, birmingham, festivals, and, one, great, experience, was, to, play, dvo, k, s, symphony, no, 6, and, stabat, mater, under, the, composer, s, baton, elgar, regularly, played, the, bassoon, in, a, wind, quintet, alongside, his, brother, frank, an, oboist, and, conductor, who, ran, his, own, wind, band, elgar, arranged, numerous, pieces, by, mozart, beethoven, haydn, and, others, for, the, quintet, honing, his, arranging, and, compositional, skills, in, his, first, trips, abroad, elgar, visited, paris, in, 1880, and, leipzig, in, 1882, he, heard, saint, sa, ns, play, the, organ, at, the, madeleine, and, attended, concerts, by, first, rate, orchestras, in, 1882, he, wrote, i, got, pretty, well, dosed, with, schumann, my, ideal, brahms, rubinstein, wagner, so, had, no, cause, to, complain, in, leipzig, he, visited, a, friend, helen, weaver, who, was, a, student, at, the, conservatoire, they, became, engaged, in, the, summer, of, 1883, but, for, unknown, reasons, the, engagement, was, broken, off, the, next, year, elgar, was, greatly, distressed, and, some, of, his, later, cryptic, dedications, of, romantic, music, may, have, alluded, to, helen, and, his, feelings, for, her, throughout, his, life, elgar, was, often, inspired, by, close, women, friends, helen, weaver, was, succeeded, by, mary, lygon, dora, penny, julia, worthington, alice, stuart, wortley, and, finally, vera, hockman, who, enlivened, his, old, age, in, 1882, seeking, more, professional, orchestral, experience, elgar, was, employed, as, a, violinist, in, birmingham, in, william, stockley, s, orchestra, for, whom, he, played, every, concert, for, the, next, seven, years, and, where, he, later, said, he, learned, all, the, music, i, know, on, 13, december, 1883, he, took, part, with, stockley, in, a, performance, at, birmingham, town, hall, of, one, of, his, first, works, for, full, orchestra, the, s, r, nade, mauresque, the, first, time, one, of, his, compositions, had, been, performed, by, a, professional, orchestra, stockley, had, invited, him, to, conduct, the, piece, but, later, recalled, he, declined, and, further, insisted, upon, playing, in, his, place, in, the, orchestra, the, consequence, was, that, he, had, to, appear, fiddle, in, hand, to, acknowledge, the, genuine, and, hearty, applause, of, the, audience, elgar, often, went, to, london, in, an, attempt, to, get, his, works, published, but, this, period, in, his, life, found, him, frequently, despondent, and, low, on, money, he, wrote, to, a, friend, in, april, 1884, my, prospects, are, about, as, hopeless, as, ever, i, am, not, wanting, in, energy, i, think, so, sometimes, i, conclude, that, tis, want, of, ability, i, have, no, money, not, a, cent, when, elgar, was, 29, he, took, on, a, new, pupil, caroline, alice, roberts, known, as, alice, daughter, of, the, late, major, general, sir, henry, roberts, and, published, author, of, verse, and, prose, fiction, eight, years, older, than, elgar, alice, became, his, wife, three, years, later, elgar, s, biographer, michael, kennedy, writes, alice, s, family, was, horrified, by, her, intention, to, marry, an, unknown, musician, who, worked, in, a, shop, and, was, a, roman, catholic, she, was, disinherited, they, were, married, on, 8, may, 1889, at, brompton, oratory, from, then, until, her, death, she, acted, as, his, business, manager, and, social, secretary, dealt, with, his, mood, swings, and, was, a, perceptive, musical, critic, she, did, her, best, to, gain, him, the, attention, of, influential, society, though, with, limited, success, in, time, he, would, learn, to, accept, the, honours, given, him, realising, that, they, mattered, more, to, her, and, her, social, class, and, recognising, what, she, had, given, up, to, further, his, career, in, her, diary, she, wrote, the, care, of, a, genius, is, enough, of, a, life, work, for, any, woman, as, an, engagement, present, elgar, dedicated, his, short, violin, and, piano, piece, salut, d, amour, to, her, with, alice, s, encouragement, the, elgars, moved, to, london, to, be, closer, to, the, centre, of, british, musical, life, and, elgar, started, devoting, his, time, to, composition, their, only, child, carice, irene, was, born, at, their, home, in, west, kensington, on, 14, august, 1890, her, name, revealed, in, elgar, s, dedication, of, salut, d, amour, was, a, contraction, of, her, mother, s, names, caroline, and, alice, elgar, took, full, advantage, of, the, opportunity, to, hear, unfamiliar, music, in, the, days, before, miniature, scores, and, recordings, were, available, it, was, not, easy, for, young, composers, to, get, to, know, new, music, elgar, took, every, chance, to, do, so, at, the, crystal, palace, concerts, he, and, alice, attended, day, after, day, hearing, music, by, a, wide, range, of, composers, among, these, were, masters, of, orchestration, from, whom, he, learned, much, such, as, berlioz, and, richard, wagner, his, own, compositions, made, little, impact, on, london, s, musical, scene, august, manns, conducted, elgar, s, orchestral, version, of, salut, d, amour, and, the, suite, in, d, at, the, crystal, palace, and, two, publishers, accepted, some, of, elgar, s, violin, pieces, organ, voluntaries, and, part, songs, some, tantalising, opportunities, seemed, to, be, within, reach, but, vanished, unexpectedly, for, example, an, offer, from, the, royal, opera, house, covent, garden, to, run, through, some, of, his, works, was, withdrawn, at, the, last, second, when, sir, arthur, sullivan, arrived, unannounced, to, rehearse, some, of, his, own, music, sullivan, was, horrified, when, elgar, later, told, him, what, had, happened, elgar, s, only, important, commission, while, in, london, came, from, his, home, city, the, worcester, festival, committee, invited, him, to, compose, a, short, orchestral, work, for, the, 1890, three, choirs, festival, the, result, is, described, by, diana, mcveagh, in, the, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, as, his, first, major, work, the, assured, and, uninhibited, froissart, elgar, conducted, the, first, performance, in, worcester, in, september, 1890, for, lack, of, other, work, he, was, obliged, to, leave, london, in, 1891, and, return, with, his, wife, and, child, to, worcestershire, where, he, could, earn, a, living, conducting, local, musical, ensembles, and, teaching, they, settled, in, alice, s, former, home, town, great, malvern, during, the, 1890s, elgar, gradually, built, up, a, reputation, as, a, composer, chiefly, of, works, for, the, great, choral, festivals, of, the, english, midlands, the, black, knight, 1892, and, king, olaf, 1896, both, inspired, by, longfellow, the, light, of, life, 1896, and, caractacus, 1898, were, all, modestly, successful, and, he, obtained, a, long, standing, publisher, in, novello, and, co, other, works, of, this, decade, included, the, serenade, for, strings, 1892, and, three, bavarian, dances, 1897, elgar, was, of, enough, consequence, locally, to, recommend, the, young, composer, samuel, coleridge, taylor, to, the, three, choirs, festival, for, a, concert, piece, which, helped, establish, the, younger, man, s, career, elgar, was, catching, the, attention, of, prominent, critics, but, their, reviews, were, polite, rather, than, enthusiastic, although, he, was, in, demand, as, a, festival, composer, he, was, only, just, getting, by, financially, and, felt, unappreciated, in, 1898, he, said, he, was, very, sick, at, heart, over, music, and, hoped, to, find, a, way, to, succeed, with, a, larger, work, his, friend, august, jaeger, tried, to, lift, his, spirits, a, day, s, attack, of, the, blues, will, not, drive, away, your, desire, your, necessity, which, is, to, exercise, those, creative, faculties, which, a, kind, providence, has, given, you, your, time, of, universal, recognition, will, come, in, 1899, that, prediction, suddenly, came, true, at, the, age, of, forty, two, elgar, produced, the, enigma, variations, which, were, premiered, in, london, under, the, baton, of, the, eminent, german, conductor, hans, richter, in, elgar, s, own, words, i, have, sketched, a, set, of, variations, on, an, original, theme, the, variations, have, amused, me, because, i, ve, labelled, them, with, the, nicknames, of, my, particular, friends, that, is, to, say, i, ve, written, the, variations, each, one, to, represent, the, mood, of, the, party, the, person, and, have, written, what, i, think, they, would, have, written, if, they, were, asses, enough, to, compose, he, dedicated, the, work, to, my, friends, pictured, within, probably, the, best, known, variation, is, nimrod, depicting, jaeger, purely, musical, considerations, led, elgar, to, omit, variations, depicting, arthur, sullivan, and, hubert, parry, whose, styles, he, tried, but, failed, to, incorporate, in, the, variations, the, large, scale, work, was, received, with, general, acclaim, for, its, originality, charm, and, craftsmanship, and, it, established, elgar, as, the, pre, eminent, british, composer, of, his, generation, the, work, is, formally, titled, variations, on, an, original, theme, the, word, enigma, appears, over, the, first, six, bars, of, music, which, led, to, the, familiar, version, of, the, title, the, enigma, is, that, although, there, are, fourteen, variations, on, the, original, theme, there, is, another, overarching, theme, never, identified, by, elgar, which, he, said, runs, through, and, over, the, whole, set, but, is, never, heard, later, commentators, have, observed, that, although, elgar, is, today, regarded, as, a, characteristically, english, composer, his, orchestral, music, and, this, work, in, particular, share, much, with, the, central, european, tradition, typified, at, the, time, by, the, work, of, richard, strauss, the, enigma, variations, were, well, received, in, germany, and, italy, and, remain, to, the, present, day, a, worldwide, concert, staple, elgar, s, biographer, basil, maine, commented, when, sir, arthur, sullivan, died, in, 1900, it, became, apparent, to, many, that, elgar, although, a, composer, of, another, build, was, his, true, successor, as, first, musician, of, the, land, elgar, s, next, major, work, was, eagerly, awaited, for, the, birmingham, triennial, music, festival, of, 1900, he, set, cardinal, john, henry, newman, s, poem, the, dream, of, gerontius, for, soloists, chorus, and, orchestra, richter, conducted, the, premiere, which, was, marred, by, a, poorly, prepared, chorus, which, sang, badly, critics, recognised, the, mastery, of, the, piece, despite, the, defects, in, performance, it, was, performed, in, d, sseldorf, germany, in, 1901, and, again, in, 1902, conducted, by, julius, buths, who, also, conducted, the, european, premiere, of, the, enigma, variations, in, 1901, the, german, press, was, enthusiastic, the, cologne, gazette, said, in, both, parts, we, meet, with, beauties, of, imperishable, value, elgar, stands, on, the, shoulders, of, berlioz, wagner, and, liszt, from, whose, influences, he, has, freed, himself, until, he, has, become, an, important, individuality, he, is, one, of, the, leaders, of, musical, art, of, modern, times, the, d, sseldorfer, volksblatt, wrote, a, memorable, and, epoch, making, first, performance, since, the, days, of, liszt, nothing, has, been, produced, in, the, way, of, oratorio, which, reaches, the, greatness, and, importance, of, this, sacred, cantata, richard, strauss, then, widely, viewed, as, the, leading, composer, of, his, day, was, so, impressed, that, in, elgar, s, presence, he, proposed, a, toast, to, the, success, of, the, first, english, progressive, musician, meister, elgar, performances, in, vienna, paris, and, new, york, followed, and, the, dream, of, gerontius, soon, became, equally, admired, in, britain, according, to, kennedy, it, is, unquestionably, the, greatest, british, work, in, the, oratorio, form, opened, a, new, chapter, in, the, english, choral, tradition, and, liberated, it, from, its, handelian, preoccupation, elgar, as, a, roman, catholic, was, much, moved, by, newman, s, poem, about, the, death, and, redemption, of, a, sinner, but, some, influential, members, of, the, anglican, establishment, disagreed, his, colleague, charles, villiers, stanford, complained, that, the, work, stinks, of, incense, the, dean, of, gloucester, banned, gerontius, from, his, cathedral, in, 1901, and, at, worcester, the, following, year, the, dean, insisted, on, expurgations, before, allowing, a, performance, elgar, is, probably, best, known, for, the, first, of, the, five, pomp, and, circumstance, marches, which, were, composed, between, 1901, and, 1930, it, is, familiar, to, millions, of, television, viewers, all, over, the, world, every, year, who, watch, the, last, night, of, the, proms, where, it, is, traditionally, performed, when, the, theme, of, the, slower, middle, section, technically, called, the, trio, of, the, first, march, came, into, his, head, he, told, his, friend, dora, penny, i, ve, got, a, tune, that, will, knock, em, will, knock, em, flat, when, the, first, march, was, played, in, 1901, at, a, london, promenade, concert, it, was, conducted, by, henry, wood, who, later, wrote, that, the, audience, rose, and, yelled, the, one, and, only, time, in, the, history, of, the, promenade, concerts, that, an, orchestral, item, was, accorded, a, double, encore, to, mark, the, coronation, of, edward, vii, elgar, was, commissioned, to, set, a, c, benson, s, coronation, ode, for, a, gala, concert, at, the, royal, opera, house, on, 30, june, 1902, the, approval, of, the, king, was, confirmed, and, elgar, began, work, the, contralto, clara, butt, had, persuaded, him, that, the, trio, of, the, first, pomp, and, circumstance, march, could, have, words, fitted, to, it, and, elgar, invited, benson, to, do, so, elgar, incorporated, the, new, vocal, version, into, the, ode, the, publishers, of, the, score, recognised, the, potential, of, the, vocal, piece, land, of, hope, and, glory, and, asked, benson, and, elgar, to, make, a, further, revision, for, publication, as, a, separate, song, it, was, immensely, popular, and, is, now, considered, an, unofficial, british, national, anthem, in, the, united, states, the, trio, known, simply, as, pomp, and, circumstance, or, the, graduation, march, has, been, adopted, since, 1905, for, virtually, all, high, school, and, university, graduations, in, march, 1904, a, three, day, festival, of, elgar, s, works, was, presented, at, covent, garden, an, honour, never, before, given, to, any, english, composer, the, times, commented, four, or, five, years, ago, if, any, one, had, predicted, that, the, opera, house, would, be, full, from, floor, to, ceiling, for, the, performance, of, an, oratorio, by, an, english, composer, he, would, probably, have, been, supposed, to, be, out, of, his, mind, the, king, and, queen, attended, the, first, concert, at, which, richter, conducted, the, dream, of, gerontius, and, returned, the, next, evening, for, the, second, the, london, premiere, of, the, apostles, first, heard, the, previous, year, at, the, birmingham, festival, the, final, concert, of, the, festival, conducted, by, elgar, was, primarily, orchestral, apart, for, an, excerpt, from, caractacus, and, the, complete, sea, pictures, sung, by, clara, butt, the, orchestral, items, were, froissart, the, enigma, variations, cockaigne, the, first, two, at, that, time, the, only, two, pomp, and, circumstance, marches, and, the, premiere, of, a, new, orchestral, work, in, the, south, inspired, by, a, holiday, in, italy, elgar, was, knighted, at, buckingham, palace, on, 5, july, 1904, the, following, month, he, and, his, family, moved, to, pl, s, gwyn, a, large, house, on, the, outskirts, of, hereford, overlooking, the, river, wye, where, they, lived, until, 1911, between, 1902, and, 1914, elgar, was, in, kennedy, s, words, at, the, zenith, of, popularity, he, made, four, visits, to, the, us, including, one, conducting, tour, and, earned, considerable, fees, from, the, performance, of, his, music, between, 1905, and, 1908, he, held, the, post, of, peyton, professor, of, music, at, the, university, of, birmingham, he, had, accepted, the, post, reluctantly, feeling, that, a, composer, should, not, head, a, school, of, music, he, was, not, at, ease, in, the, role, and, his, lectures, caused, controversy, with, his, attacks, on, the, critics, and, on, english, music, in, general, vulgarity, in, the, course, of, time, may, be, refined, vulgarity, often, goes, with, inventiveness, but, the, commonplace, mind, can, never, be, anything, but, commonplace, an, englishman, will, take, you, into, a, large, room, beautifully, proportioned, and, will, point, out, to, you, that, it, is, white, all, over, white, and, somebody, will, say, what, exquisite, taste, you, know, in, your, own, mind, in, your, own, soul, that, it, is, not, taste, at, all, that, it, is, the, want, of, taste, that, is, mere, evasion, english, music, is, white, and, evades, everything, he, regretted, the, controversy, and, was, glad, to, hand, on, the, post, to, his, friend, granville, bantock, in, 1908, his, new, life, as, a, celebrity, was, a, mixed, blessing, to, the, highly, strung, elgar, as, it, interrupted, his, privacy, and, he, often, was, in, ill, health, he, complained, to, jaeger, in, 1903, my, life, is, one, continual, giving, up, of, little, things, which, i, love, both, w, s, gilbert, and, thomas, hardy, sought, to, collaborate, with, elgar, in, this, decade, elgar, refused, but, would, have, collaborated, with, bernard, shaw, had, shaw, been, willing, elgar, paid, three, visits, to, the, usa, between, 1905, and, 1911, his, first, was, to, conduct, his, music, and, to, accept, a, doctorate, from, yale, university, his, principal, composition, in, 1905, was, the, introduction, and, allegro, for, strings, dedicated, to, samuel, sanford, it, was, well, received, but, did, not, catch, the, public, imagination, as, the, dream, of, gerontius, had, done, and, continued, to, do, among, keen, elgarians, however, the, kingdom, was, sometimes, preferred, to, the, earlier, work, elgar, s, friend, frank, schuster, told, the, young, adrian, boult, compared, with, the, kingdom, gerontius, is, the, work, of, a, raw, amateur, as, elgar, approached, his, fiftieth, birthday, he, began, work, on, his, first, symphony, a, project, that, had, been, in, his, mind, in, various, forms, for, nearly, ten, years, his, first, symphony, 1908, was, a, national, and, international, triumph, within, weeks, of, the, premiere, it, was, performed, in, new, york, under, walter, damrosch, vienna, under, ferdinand, l, we, st, petersburg, under, alexander, siloti, and, leipzig, under, arthur, nikisch, there, were, performances, in, rome, chicago, boston, toronto, and, fifteen, british, towns, and, cities, in, just, over, a, year, it, received, a, hundred, performances, in, britain, america, and, continental, europe, the, violin, concerto, 1910, was, commissioned, by, fritz, kreisler, one, of, the, leading, international, violinists, of, the, time, elgar, wrote, it, during, the, summer, of, 1910, with, occasional, help, from, w, h, reed, the, leader, of, the, london, symphony, orchestra, lso, who, helped, the, composer, with, advice, on, technical, points, elgar, and, reed, formed, a, firm, friendship, which, lasted, for, the, rest, of, elgar, s, life, reed, s, biography, elgar, as, i, knew, him, 1936, records, many, details, of, elgar, s, methods, of, composition, the, work, was, presented, by, the, royal, philharmonic, society, with, kreisler, and, the, lso, conducted, by, the, composer, reed, recalled, the, concerto, proved, to, be, a, complete, triumph, the, concert, a, brilliant, and, unforgettable, occasion, so, great, was, the, impact, of, the, concerto, that, kreisler, s, rival, eug, ne, ysa, e, spent, much, time, with, elgar, going, through, the, work, there, was, great, disappointment, when, contractual, difficulties, prevented, ysa, e, from, playing, it, in, london, the, violin, concerto, was, elgar, s, last, popular, triumph, the, following, year, he, presented, his, second, symphony, in, london, but, was, disappointed, at, its, reception, unlike, the, first, symphony, it, ends, not, in, a, blaze, of, orchestral, splendour, but, quietly, and, contemplatively, reed, who, played, at, the, premiere, later, wrote, that, elgar, was, recalled, to, the, platform, several, times, to, acknowledge, the, applause, but, missed, that, unmistakable, note, perceived, when, an, audience, even, an, english, audience, is, thoroughly, roused, or, worked, up, as, it, was, after, the, violin, concerto, or, the, first, symphony, elgar, asked, reed, what, is, the, matter, with, them, billy, they, sit, there, like, a, lot, of, stuffed, pigs, the, work, was, by, normal, standards, a, success, with, twenty, seven, performances, within, three, years, of, its, premiere, but, it, did, not, achieve, the, international, furore, of, the, first, symphony, in, june, 1911, as, part, of, the, celebrations, surrounding, the, coronation, of, king, george, v, elgar, was, appointed, to, the, order, of, merit, an, honour, limited, to, twenty, four, holders, at, any, time, the, following, year, the, elgars, moved, back, to, london, to, a, large, house, in, netherhall, gardens, hampstead, designed, by, norman, shaw, there, elgar, composed, his, last, two, large, scale, works, of, the, pre, war, era, the, choral, ode, the, music, makers, for, the, birmingham, festival, 1912, and, the, symphonic, study, falstaff, for, the, leeds, festival, 1913, both, were, received, politely, but, without, enthusiasm, even, the, dedicatee, of, falstaff, the, conductor, landon, ronald, confessed, privately, that, he, could, not, make, head, or, tail, of, the, piece, while, the, musical, scholar, percy, scholes, wrote, of, falstaff, that, it, was, a, great, work, but, so, far, as, public, appreciation, goes, a, comparative, failure, when, world, war, i, broke, out, elgar, was, horrified, at, the, prospect, of, the, carnage, but, his, patriotic, feelings, were, nonetheless, aroused, he, composed, a, song, for, soldiers, which, he, later, withdrew, he, signed, up, as, a, special, constable, in, the, local, police, and, later, joined, the, hampstead, volunteer, reserve, of, the, army, he, composed, patriotic, works, carillon, a, recitation, for, speaker, and, orchestra, in, honour, of, belgium, and, polonia, an, orchestral, piece, in, honour, of, poland, land, of, hope, and, glory, already, popular, became, still, more, so, and, elgar, wished, in, vain, to, have, new, less, nationalistic, words, sung, to, the, tune, elgar, s, other, compositions, during, the, war, included, incidental, music, for, a, children, s, play, the, starlight, express, 1915, a, ballet, the, sanguine, fan, 1917, and, the, spirit, of, england, 1915, 17, to, poems, by, laurence, binyon, three, choral, settings, very, different, in, character, from, the, romantic, patriotism, of, his, earlier, years, his, last, large, scale, composition, of, the, war, years, was, the, fringes, of, the, fleet, settings, of, verses, by, rudyard, kipling, performed, with, great, popular, success, around, the, country, until, kipling, for, unexplained, reasons, objected, to, their, performance, in, theatres, elgar, conducted, a, recording, of, the, work, for, the, gramophone, company, towards, the, end, of, the, war, elgar, was, in, poor, health, his, wife, thought, it, best, for, him, to, move, to, the, countryside, and, she, rented, brinkwells, a, house, near, fittleworth, in, sussex, from, the, painter, rex, vicat, cole, there, elgar, recovered, his, strength, and, in, 1918, and, 1919, he, produced, four, large, scale, works, the, first, three, of, these, were, chamber, pieces, the, violin, sonata, in, e, minor, the, piano, quintet, in, a, minor, and, the, string, quartet, in, e, minor, on, hearing, the, work, in, progress, alice, elgar, wrote, in, her, diary, e, writing, wonderful, new, music, all, three, works, were, well, received, the, times, wrote, elgar, s, sonata, contains, much, that, we, have, heard, before, in, other, forms, but, as, we, do, not, at, all, want, him, to, change, and, be, somebody, else, that, is, as, it, should, be, the, quartet, and, quintet, were, premiered, at, the, wigmore, hall, on, 21, may, 1919, the, manchester, guardian, wrote, this, quartet, with, its, tremendous, climaxes, curious, refinements, of, dance, rhythms, and, its, perfect, symmetry, and, the, quintet, more, lyrical, and, passionate, are, as, perfect, examples, of, chamber, music, as, the, great, oratorios, were, of, their, type, by, contrast, the, remaining, work, the, cello, concerto, in, e, minor, had, a, disastrous, premiere, at, the, opening, concert, of, the, lso, s, 1919, 20, season, in, october, 1919, apart, from, the, elgar, work, which, the, composer, conducted, the, rest, of, the, programme, was, conducted, by, albert, coates, who, overran, his, rehearsal, time, at, the, expense, of, elgar, s, lady, elgar, wrote, that, brutal, selfish, ill, mannered, bounder, that, brute, coates, went, on, rehearsing, the, critic, of, the, observer, ernest, newman, wrote, there, have, been, rumours, about, during, the, week, of, inadequate, rehearsal, whatever, the, explanation, the, sad, fact, remains, that, never, in, all, probability, has, so, great, an, orchestra, made, so, lamentable, an, exhibition, of, itself, the, work, itself, is, lovely, stuff, very, simple, that, pregnant, simplicity, that, has, come, upon, elgar, s, music, in, the, last, couple, of, years, but, with, a, profound, wisdom, and, beauty, underlying, its, simplicity, elgar, attached, no, blame, to, his, soloist, felix, salmond, who, played, the, work, for, him, again, later, in, contrast, with, the, first, symphony, and, its, hundred, performances, in, just, over, a, year, the, cello, concerto, did, not, have, a, second, performance, in, london, for, more, than, a, year, although, in, the, 1920s, elgar, s, music, was, no, longer, in, fashion, his, admirers, continued, to, present, his, works, when, possible, reed, singles, out, a, performance, of, the, second, symphony, in, march, 1920, conducted, by, a, young, man, almost, unknown, to, the, public, adrian, boult, for, bringing, the, grandeur, and, nobility, of, the, work, to, a, wider, public, also, in, 1920, landon, ronald, presented, an, all, elgar, concert, at, the, queen, s, hall, alice, elgar, wrote, with, enthusiasm, about, the, reception, of, the, symphony, but, this, was, one, of, the, last, times, she, heard, elgar, s, music, played, in, public, after, a, short, illness, she, died, of, lung, cancer, on, 7, april, 1920, at, the, age, of, seventy, two, elgar, was, devastated, by, the, loss, of, his, wife, with, no, public, demand, for, new, works, and, deprived, of, alice, s, constant, support, and, inspiration, he, allowed, himself, to, be, deflected, from, composition, his, daughter, later, wrote, that, elgar, inherited, from, his, father, a, reluctance, to, settle, down, to, work, on, hand, but, could, cheerfully, spend, hours, over, some, perfectly, unnecessary, and, entirely, unremunerative, undertaking, a, trait, that, became, stronger, after, alice, s, death, for, much, of, the, rest, of, his, life, elgar, indulged, himself, in, his, several, hobbies, throughout, his, life, he, was, a, keen, amateur, chemist, sometimes, using, a, laboratory, in, his, back, garden, he, even, patented, the, elgar, sulphuretted, hydrogen, apparatus, in, 1908, he, enjoyed, football, supporting, wolverhampton, wanderers, f, c, for, whom, he, composed, an, anthem, he, banged, the, leather, for, goal, and, in, his, later, years, he, frequently, attended, horseraces, his, prot, g, s, the, conductor, malcolm, sargent, and, violinist, yehudi, menuhin, both, recalled, rehearsals, with, elgar, at, which, he, swiftly, satisfied, himself, that, all, was, well, and, then, went, off, to, the, races, in, his, younger, days, elgar, had, been, an, enthusiastic, cyclist, buying, royal, sunbeam, bicycles, for, himself, and, his, wife, in, 1903, he, named, his, mr, phoebus, as, an, elderly, widower, he, enjoyed, being, driven, about, the, countryside, by, his, chauffeur, in, november, and, december, 1923, he, took, a, voyage, to, brazil, journeying, up, the, amazon, to, manaus, where, he, was, impressed, by, its, opera, house, the, teatro, amazonas, almost, nothing, is, recorded, about, elgar, s, activities, or, the, events, that, he, encountered, during, the, trip, which, gave, the, novelist, james, hamilton, paterson, considerable, latitude, when, writing, gerontius, a, fictional, account, of, the, journey, after, alice, s, death, elgar, sold, the, hampstead, house, and, after, living, for, a, short, time, in, a, flat, in, st, james, s, in, the, heart, of, london, he, moved, back, to, worcestershire, to, the, village, of, kempsey, where, he, lived, from, 1923, to, 1927, he, did, not, wholly, abandon, composition, in, these, years, he, made, large, scale, symphonic, arrangements, of, works, by, bach, and, handel, and, wrote, his, empire, march, and, eight, songs, pageant, of, empire, for, the, 1924, british, empire, exhibition, shortly, after, these, were, published, he, was, appointed, master, of, the, king, s, musick, on, 13, may, 1924, following, the, death, of, sir, walter, parratt, from, 1926, onwards, elgar, made, a, series, of, recordings, of, his, own, works, described, by, the, music, writer, robert, philip, as, the, first, composer, to, take, the, gramophone, seriously, he, had, already, recorded, much, of, his, music, by, the, early, acoustic, recording, process, for, his, master, s, voice, hmv, from, 1914, onwards, but, the, introduction, of, electrical, microphones, in, 1925, transformed, the, gramophone, from, a, novelty, into, a, realistic, medium, for, reproducing, orchestral, and, choral, music, elgar, was, the, first, composer, to, take, full, advantage, of, this, technological, advance, fred, gaisberg, of, hmv, who, produced, elgar, s, recordings, set, up, a, series, of, sessions, to, capture, on, disc, the, composer, s, interpretations, of, his, major, orchestral, works, including, the, enigma, variations, falstaff, the, first, and, second, symphonies, and, the, cello, and, violin, concertos, for, most, of, these, the, orchestra, was, the, lso, but, the, variations, were, played, by, the, royal, albert, hall, orchestra, later, in, the, series, of, recordings, elgar, also, conducted, two, newly, founded, orchestras, boult, s, bbc, symphony, orchestra, and, sir, thomas, beecham, s, london, philharmonic, orchestra, elgar, s, recordings, were, released, on, 78, rpm, discs, by, both, hmv, and, rca, victor, after, world, war, ii, the, 1932, recording, of, the, violin, concerto, with, the, teenage, menuhin, as, soloist, remained, available, on, 78, and, later, on, lp, but, the, other, recordings, were, out, of, the, catalogues, for, some, years, when, they, were, reissued, by, emi, on, lp, in, the, 1970s, they, caused, surprise, to, many, by, their, fast, tempi, in, contrast, to, the, slower, speeds, adopted, by, many, conductors, in, the, years, since, elgar, s, death, the, recordings, were, reissued, on, cd, in, the, 1990s, in, november, 1931, elgar, was, filmed, by, path, for, a, newsreel, depicting, a, recording, session, of, pomp, and, circumstance, march, no, 1, at, the, opening, of, emi, s, abbey, road, studios, in, london, it, is, believed, to, be, the, only, surviving, sound, film, of, elgar, who, makes, a, brief, remark, before, conducting, the, lso, asking, the, musicians, to, play, this, tune, as, though, you, ve, never, heard, it, before, a, memorial, plaque, to, elgar, at, abbey, road, was, unveiled, on, 24, june, 1993, a, late, piece, of, elgar, s, the, nursery, suite, was, an, early, example, of, a, studio, premiere, its, first, performance, was, in, the, abbey, road, studios, for, this, work, dedicated, to, the, wife, and, daughters, of, the, duke, of, york, elgar, once, again, drew, on, his, youthful, sketch, books, in, his, final, years, elgar, experienced, a, musical, revival, the, bbc, organised, a, festival, of, his, works, to, celebrate, his, seventy, fifth, birthday, in, 1932, he, flew, to, paris, in, 1933, to, conduct, the, violin, concerto, for, menuhin, while, in, france, he, visited, his, fellow, composer, frederick, delius, at, his, house, at, grez, sur, loing, he, was, sought, out, by, younger, musicians, such, as, adrian, boult, malcolm, sargent, and, john, barbirolli, who, championed, his, music, when, it, was, out, of, fashion, he, began, work, on, an, opera, the, spanish, lady, and, accepted, a, commission, from, the, bbc, to, compose, a, third, symphony, his, final, illness, prevented, their, completion, he, fretted, about, the, unfinished, works, he, asked, reed, to, ensure, that, nobody, would, tinker, with, the, sketches, and, attempt, a, completion, of, the, symphony, but, at, other, times, he, said, if, i, can, t, complete, the, third, symphony, somebody, will, complete, it, or, write, a, better, one, after, elgar, s, death, percy, m, young, in, co, operation, with, the, bbc, and, elgar, s, daughter, carice, produced, a, version, of, the, spanish, lady, which, was, issued, on, cd, the, third, symphony, sketches, were, elaborated, by, the, composer, anthony, payne, into, a, complete, score, in, 1997, inoperable, colorectal, cancer, was, discovered, during, an, operation, on, 8, october, 1933, he, told, his, consulting, doctor, arthur, thomson, that, he, had, no, faith, in, an, afterlife, i, believe, there, is, nothing, but, complete, oblivion, elgar, died, on, 23, february, 1934, at, the, age, of, seventy, six, and, was, buried, next, to, his, wife, at, st, wulstan, s, roman, catholic, church, in, little, malvern, elgar, was, contemptuous, of, folk, music, and, had, little, interest, in, or, respect, for, the, early, english, composers, calling, william, byrd, and, his, contemporaries, museum, pieces, of, later, english, composers, he, regarded, purcell, as, the, greatest, and, he, said, that, he, had, learned, much, of, his, own, technique, from, studying, hubert, parry, s, writings, the, continental, composers, who, most, influenced, elgar, were, handel, dvo, k, and, to, some, degree, brahms, in, elgar, s, chromaticism, the, influence, of, wagner, is, apparent, but, elgar, s, individual, style, of, orchestration, owes, much, to, the, clarity, of, nineteenth, century, french, composers, berlioz, massenet, saint, sa, ns, and, particularly, delibes, whose, music, elgar, played, and, conducted, at, worcester, and, greatly, admired, elgar, began, composing, when, still, a, child, and, all, his, life, he, drew, on, his, early, sketchbooks, for, themes, and, inspiration, the, habit, of, assembling, his, compositions, even, large, scale, ones, from, scraps, of, themes, jotted, down, randomly, remained, throughout, his, life, his, early, adult, works, included, violin, and, piano, pieces, music, for, the, wind, quintet, in, which, he, and, his, brother, played, between, 1878, and, 1881, and, music, of, many, types, for, the, powick, asylum, band, diana, mcveagh, in, grove, s, dictionary, finds, many, embryonic, elgarian, touches, in, these, pieces, but, few, of, them, are, regularly, played, except, salut, d, amour, and, as, arranged, decades, later, into, the, wand, of, youth, suites, some, of, the, childhood, sketches, elgar, s, sole, work, of, note, during, his, first, spell, in, london, in, 1889, 91, the, overture, froissart, was, a, romantic, bravura, piece, influenced, by, mendelssohn, and, wagner, but, also, showing, further, elgarian, characteristics, orchestral, works, composed, during, the, subsequent, years, in, worcestershire, include, the, serenade, for, strings, and, three, bavarian, dances, in, this, period, and, later, elgar, wrote, songs, and, part, songs, w, h, reed, expressed, reservations, about, these, pieces, but, praised, the, part, song, the, snow, for, female, voices, and, sea, pictures, a, cycle, of, five, songs, for, contralto, and, orchestra, which, remains, in, the, repertory, elgar, s, principal, large, scale, early, works, were, for, chorus, and, orchestra, for, the, three, choirs, and, other, festivals, these, were, the, black, knight, king, olaf, the, light, of, life, the, banner, of, st, george, and, caractacus, he, also, wrote, a, te, deum, and, benedictus, for, the, hereford, festival, of, these, mcveagh, comments, favourably, on, his, lavish, orchestration, and, innovative, use, of, leitmotifs, but, less, favourably, on, the, qualities, of, his, chosen, texts, and, the, patchiness, of, his, inspiration, mcveagh, makes, the, point, that, because, these, works, of, the, 1890s, were, for, many, years, little, known, and, performances, remain, rare, the, mastery, of, his, first, great, success, the, enigma, variations, appeared, to, be, a, sudden, transformation, from, mediocrity, to, genius, but, in, fact, his, orchestral, skills, had, been, building, up, throughout, the, decade, elgar, s, best, known, works, were, composed, within, the, twenty, one, years, between, 1899, and, 1920, most, of, them, are, orchestral, reed, wrote, elgar, s, genius, rose, to, its, greatest, height, in, his, orchestral, works, and, quoted, the, composer, as, saying, that, even, in, his, oratorios, the, orchestral, part, is, the, most, important, the, enigma, variations, made, elgar, s, name, nationally, the, variation, form, was, ideal, for, him, at, this, stage, of, his, career, when, his, comprehensive, mastery, of, orchestration, was, still, in, contrast, to, his, tendency, to, write, his, melodies, in, short, sometimes, rigid, phrases, his, next, orchestral, works, cockaigne, a, concert, overture, 1900, 1901, the, first, two, pomp, and, circumstance, marches, 1901, and, the, gentle, dream, children, 1902, are, all, short, the, longest, of, them, cockaigne, lasting, less, than, fifteen, minutes, in, the, south, 1903, 1904, although, designated, by, elgar, as, a, concert, overture, is, according, to, kennedy, really, a, tone, poem, and, the, longest, continuous, piece, of, purely, orchestral, writing, elgar, had, essayed, he, wrote, it, after, setting, aside, an, early, attempt, to, compose, a, symphony, the, work, reveals, his, continuing, progress, in, writing, sustained, themes, and, orchestral, lines, although, some, critics, including, kennedy, find, that, in, the, middle, part, elgar, s, inspiration, burns, at, less, than, its, brightest, in, 1905, elgar, completed, the, introduction, and, allegro, for, strings, this, work, is, based, unlike, much, of, elgar, s, earlier, writing, not, on, a, profusion, of, themes, but, on, only, three, kennedy, called, it, a, masterly, composition, equalled, among, english, works, for, strings, only, by, vaughan, williams, s, tallis, fantasia, during, the, next, four, years, elgar, composed, three, major, concert, pieces, which, though, shorter, than, comparable, works, by, some, of, his, european, contemporaries, are, among, the, most, substantial, such, works, by, an, english, composer, these, were, his, first, symphony, violin, concerto, and, second, symphony, which, all, play, for, between, forty, five, minutes, and, an, hour, mcveagh, says, of, the, symphonies, that, they, rank, high, not, only, in, elgar, s, output, but, in, english, musical, history, both, are, long, and, powerful, without, published, programmes, only, hints, and, quotations, to, indicate, some, inward, drama, from, which, they, derive, their, vitality, and, eloquence, both, are, based, on, classical, form, but, differ, from, it, to, the, extent, that, they, were, considered, prolix, and, slackly, constructed, by, some, critics, certainly, the, invention, in, them, is, copious, each, symphony, would, need, several, dozen, music, examples, to, chart, its, progress, elgar, s, violin, concerto, and, cello, concerto, in, the, view, of, kennedy, rank, not, only, among, his, finest, works, but, among, the, greatest, of, their, kind, they, are, however, very, different, from, each, other, the, violin, concerto, composed, in, 1909, as, elgar, reached, the, height, of, his, popularity, and, written, for, the, instrument, dearest, to, his, heart, is, lyrical, throughout, and, rhapsodical, and, brilliant, by, turns, the, cello, concerto, composed, a, decade, later, immediately, after, world, war, i, seems, in, kennedy, s, words, to, belong, to, another, age, another, world, the, simplest, of, all, elgar, s, major, works, also, the, least, grandiloquent, between, the, two, concertos, came, elgar, s, symphonic, study, falstaff, which, has, divided, opinion, even, among, elgar, s, strongest, admirers, donald, tovey, viewed, it, as, one, of, the, immeasurably, great, things, in, music, with, power, identical, with, shakespeare, s, while, kennedy, criticises, the, work, for, too, frequent, reliance, on, sequences, and, an, over, idealised, depiction, of, the, female, characters, reed, thought, that, the, principal, themes, show, less, distinction, than, some, of, elgar, s, earlier, works, elgar, himself, thought, falstaff, the, highest, point, of, his, purely, orchestral, work, the, major, works, for, voices, and, orchestra, of, the, twenty, one, years, of, elgar, s, middle, period, are, three, large, scale, works, for, soloists, chorus, and, orchestra, the, dream, of, gerontius, 1900, and, the, oratorios, the, apostles, 1903, and, the, kingdom, 1906, and, two, shorter, odes, the, coronation, ode, 1902, and, the, music, makers, 1912, the, first, of, the, odes, as, a, pi, ce, d, occasion, has, rarely, been, revived, after, its, initial, success, with, the, culminating, land, of, hope, and, glory, the, second, is, for, elgar, unusual, in, that, it, contains, several, quotations, from, his, earlier, works, as, richard, strauss, quoted, himself, in, ein, heldenleben, the, choral, works, were, all, successful, although, the, first, gerontius, was, and, remains, the, best, loved, and, most, performed, on, the, manuscript, elgar, wrote, quoting, john, ruskin, this, is, the, best, of, me, for, the, rest, i, ate, and, drank, and, slept, loved, and, hated, like, another, my, life, was, as, the, vapour, and, is, not, but, this, i, saw, and, knew, this, if, anything, of, mine, is, worth, your, memory, all, three, of, the, large, scale, works, follow, the, traditional, model, with, sections, for, soloists, chorus, and, both, together, elgar, s, distinctive, orchestration, as, well, as, his, melodic, inspiration, lifts, them, to, a, higher, level, than, most, of, their, british, predecessors, elgar, s, other, works, of, his, middle, period, include, incidental, music, for, grania, and, diarmid, a, play, by, george, moore, and, w, b, yeats, 1901, and, for, the, starlight, express, a, play, based, on, a, story, by, algernon, blackwood, 1916, of, the, former, yeats, called, elgar, s, music, wonderful, in, its, heroic, melancholy, elgar, also, wrote, a, number, of, songs, during, his, peak, period, of, which, reed, observes, it, cannot, be, said, that, he, enriched, the, vocal, repertory, to, the, same, extent, as, he, did, that, of, the, orchestra, after, the, cello, concerto, elgar, completed, no, more, large, scale, works, he, made, arrangements, of, works, by, bach, handel, and, chopin, in, distinctively, elgarian, orchestration, and, once, again, turned, his, youthful, notebooks, to, use, for, the, nursery, suite, 1931, his, other, compositions, of, this, period, have, not, held, a, place, in, the, regular, repertory, for, most, of, the, rest, of, the, twentieth, century, it, was, generally, agreed, that, elgar, s, creative, impulse, ceased, after, his, wife, s, death, anthony, payne, s, elaboration, of, the, sketches, for, elgar, s, third, symphony, into, a, complete, score, led, to, a, reconsideration, of, this, supposition, elgar, left, the, opening, of, the, symphony, complete, in, full, score, and, those, pages, along, with, others, show, elgar, s, orchestration, changed, markedly, from, the, richness, of, his, pre, war, work, the, gramophone, described, the, opening, of, the, new, work, as, something, thrilling, unforgettably, gaunt, its, first, public, performance, was, given, by, the, bbc, symphony, orchestra, under, andrew, davis, in, london, on, 15, february, 1998, payne, also, subsequently, produced, a, performing, version, of, the, sketches, for, a, sixth, pomp, and, circumstance, march, premiered, at, the, proms, in, august, 2006, elgar, s, sketches, for, a, piano, concerto, dating, from, 1913, were, elaborated, by, the, composer, robert, walker, and, first, performed, in, august, 1997, by, the, pianist, david, owen, norris, the, realisation, has, since, been, extensively, revised, views, of, elgar, s, stature, have, varied, in, the, decades, since, his, music, came, to, prominence, at, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, richard, strauss, as, noted, hailed, elgar, as, a, progressive, composer, even, the, hostile, reviewer, in, the, observer, unimpressed, by, the, thematic, material, of, the, first, symphony, in, 1908, called, the, orchestration, magnificently, modern, hans, richter, rated, elgar, as, the, greatest, modern, composer, in, any, country, and, richter, s, colleague, arthur, nikisch, considered, the, first, symphony, a, masterpiece, of, the, first, order, to, be, justly, ranked, with, the, great, symphonic, models, beethoven, and, brahms, by, contrast, the, critic, w, j, turner, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, wrote, of, elgar, s, salvation, army, symphonies, and, herbert, von, karajan, called, the, enigma, variations, second, hand, brahms, elgar, s, immense, popularity, was, not, long, lived, after, the, success, of, his, first, symphony, and, violin, concerto, his, second, symphony, and, cello, concerto, were, politely, received, but, without, the, earlier, wild, enthusiasm, his, music, was, identified, in, the, public, mind, with, the, edwardian, era, and, after, the, first, world, war, he, no, longer, seemed, a, progressive, or, modern, composer, in, the, early, 1920s, even, the, first, symphony, had, only, one, london, performance, in, more, than, three, years, wood, and, younger, conductors, such, as, boult, sargent, and, barbirolli, championed, elgar, s, music, but, in, the, recording, catalogues, and, the, concert, programmes, of, the, middle, of, the, century, his, works, were, not, well, represented, in, 1924, the, music, scholar, edward, j, dent, wrote, an, article, for, a, german, music, journal, in, which, he, identified, four, features, of, elgar, s, style, that, gave, offence, to, a, section, of, english, opinion, namely, dent, indicated, the, academic, and, snobbish, section, too, emotional, not, quite, free, from, vulgarity, pompous, and, too, deliberately, noble, in, expression, this, article, was, reprinted, in, 1930, and, caused, controversy, in, the, later, years, of, the, century, there, was, in, britain, at, least, a, revival, of, interest, in, elgar, s, music, the, features, that, had, offended, austere, taste, in, the, inter, war, years, were, seen, from, a, different, perspective, in, 1955, the, reference, book, the, record, guide, wrote, of, the, edwardian, background, during, the, height, of, elgar, s, career, boastful, self, confidence, emotional, vulgarity, material, extravagance, a, ruthless, philistinism, expressed, in, tasteless, architecture, and, every, kind, of, expensive, yet, hideous, accessory, such, features, of, a, late, phase, of, imperial, england, are, faithfully, reflected, in, elgar, s, larger, works, and, are, apt, to, prove, indigestible, today, but, if, it, is, difficult, to, overlook, the, bombastic, the, sentimental, and, the, trivial, elements, in, his, music, the, effort, to, do, so, should, nevertheless, be, made, for, the, sake, of, the, many, inspired, pages, the, power, and, eloquence, and, lofty, pathos, of, elgar, s, best, work, anyone, who, doubts, the, fact, of, elgar, s, genius, should, take, the, first, opportunity, of, hearing, the, dream, of, gerontius, which, remains, his, masterpiece, as, it, is, his, largest, and, perhaps, most, deeply, felt, work, the, symphonic, study, falstaff, the, introduction, and, allegro, for, strings, the, enigma, variations, and, the, violoncello, concerto, by, the, 1960s, a, less, severe, view, was, being, taken, of, the, edwardian, era, in, 1966, the, critic, frank, howes, wrote, that, elgar, reflected, the, last, blaze, of, opulence, expansiveness, and, full, blooded, life, before, world, war, i, swept, so, much, away, in, howes, s, view, there, was, a, touch, of, vulgarity, in, both, the, era, and, elgar, s, music, but, a, composer, is, entitled, to, be, judged, by, posterity, for, his, best, work, elgar, is, historically, important, for, giving, to, english, music, a, sense, of, the, orchestra, for, expressing, what, it, felt, like, to, be, alive, in, the, edwardian, age, for, conferring, on, the, world, at, least, four, unqualified, masterpieces, and, for, thereby, restoring, england, to, the, comity, of, musical, nations, in, 1967, the, critic, and, analyst, david, cox, considered, the, question, of, the, supposed, englishness, of, elgar, s, music, cox, noted, that, elgar, disliked, folk, songs, and, never, used, them, in, his, works, opting, for, an, idiom, that, was, essentially, german, leavened, by, a, lightness, derived, from, french, composers, including, berlioz, and, gounod, how, then, asked, cox, could, elgar, be, the, most, english, of, composers, cox, found, the, answer, in, elgar, s, own, personality, which, could, use, the, alien, idioms, in, such, a, way, as, to, make, of, them, a, vital, form, of, expression, that, was, his, and, his, alone, and, the, personality, that, comes, through, in, the, music, is, english, this, point, about, elgar, s, transmuting, his, influences, had, been, touched, on, before, in, 1930, the, times, wrote, when, elgar, s, first, symphony, came, out, someone, attempted, to, prove, that, its, main, tune, on, which, all, depends, was, like, the, grail, theme, in, parsifal, but, the, attempt, fell, flat, because, everyone, else, including, those, who, disliked, the, tune, had, instantly, recognized, it, as, typically, elgarian, while, the, grail, theme, is, as, typically, wagnerian, as, for, elgar, s, englishness, his, fellow, composers, recognised, it, richard, strauss, and, stravinsky, made, particular, reference, to, it, and, sibelius, called, him, the, personification, of, the, true, english, character, in, music, a, noble, personality, and, a, born, aristocrat, among, elgar, s, admirers, there, is, disagreement, about, which, of, his, works, are, to, be, regarded, as, masterpieces, the, enigma, variations, are, generally, counted, among, them, the, dream, of, gerontius, has, also, been, given, high, praise, by, elgarians, and, the, cello, concerto, is, similarly, rated, many, rate, the, violin, concerto, equally, highly, but, some, do, not, sackville, west, omitted, it, from, the, list, of, elgar, masterpieces, in, the, record, guide, and, in, a, long, analytical, article, in, the, musical, quarterly, daniel, gregory, mason, criticised, the, first, movement, of, the, concerto, for, a, kind, of, sing, songiness, as, fatal, to, noble, rhythm, in, music, as, it, is, in, poetry, falstaff, also, divides, opinion, it, has, never, been, a, great, popular, favourite, and, kennedy, and, reed, identify, shortcomings, in, it, in, a, musical, times, 1957, centenary, symposium, on, elgar, led, by, vaughan, williams, by, contrast, several, contributors, share, eric, blom, s, view, that, falstaff, is, the, greatest, of, all, elgar, s, works, the, two, symphonies, divide, opinion, even, more, sharply, mason, rates, the, second, poorly, for, its, over, obvious, rhythmic, scheme, but, calls, the, first, elgar, s, masterpiece, it, is, hard, to, see, how, any, candid, student, can, deny, the, greatness, of, this, symphony, however, in, the, 1957, centenary, symposium, several, leading, admirers, of, elgar, express, reservations, about, one, or, both, symphonies, in, the, same, year, roger, fiske, wrote, in, the, gramophone, for, some, reason, few, people, seem, to, like, the, two, elgar, symphonies, equally, each, has, its, champions, and, often, they, are, more, than, a, little, bored, by, the, rival, work, the, critic, john, warrack, wrote, there, are, no, sadder, pages, in, symphonic, literature, than, the, close, of, the, first, symphony, s, adagio, as, horn, and, trombones, twice, softly, intone, a, phrase, of, utter, grief, whereas, to, michael, kennedy, the, movement, is, notable, for, its, lack, of, anguished, yearning, and, angst, and, is, marked, instead, by, a, benevolent, tranquillity, despite, the, fluctuating, critical, assessment, of, the, various, works, over, the, years, elgar, s, major, works, taken, as, a, whole, have, in, the, twenty, first, century, recovered, strongly, from, their, neglect, in, the, 1950s, the, record, guide, in, 1955, could, list, only, one, currently, available, recording, of, the, first, symphony, none, of, the, second, one, of, the, violin, concerto, two, of, the, cello, concerto, two, of, the, enigma, variations, one, of, falstaff, and, none, of, the, dream, of, gerontius, since, then, there, have, been, multiple, recordings, of, all, the, major, works, more, than, thirty, recordings, have, been, made, of, the, first, symphony, since, 1955, for, example, and, more, than, a, dozen, of, the, dream, of, gerontius, similarly, in, the, concert, hall, elgar, s, works, after, a, period, of, neglect, are, once, again, frequently, programmed, the, elgar, society, s, website, in, its, diary, of, forthcoming, performances, lists, performances, of, elgar, s, works, by, orchestras, soloists, and, conductors, across, europe, north, america, and, australasia, elgar, was, knighted, in, 1904, and, in, 1911, he, was, appointed, a, member, of, the,
