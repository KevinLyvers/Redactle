the, 1950s, when, it, was, popular, and, who, only, came, to, champion, abolishing, the, death, penalty, when, this, was, popular, with, the, french, people, as, minister, of, justice, he, was, an, official, representative, of, france, during, the, wedding, of, rainier, iii, prince, of, monaco, and, actress, grace, kelly, under, the, fourth, republic, he, was, representative, of, a, generation, of, young, ambitious, politicians, he, appeared, as, a, possible, future, prime, minister, in, 1958, mitterrand, was, one, of, the, few, to, object, to, the, nomination, of, charles, de, gaulle, as, head, of, government, and, to, de, gaulle, s, plan, for, a, fifth, republic, he, justified, his, opposition, by, the, circumstances, of, de, gaulle, s, comeback, the, 13, may, 1958, quasi, putsch, and, military, pressure, in, september, 1958, determinedly, opposed, to, charles, de, gaulle, fran, ois, mitterrand, made, an, appeal, to, vote, no, in, the, referendum, over, the, constitution, which, was, nevertheless, adopted, on, 4, october, 1958, this, defeated, coalition, of, the, no, was, composed, of, the, pcf, and, some, left, wing, republican, politicians, such, as, pierre, mend, s, france, and, fran, ois, mitterrand, this, attitude, may, have, been, a, factor, in, mitterrand, s, losing, his, seat, in, the, 1958, elections, beginning, a, long, crossing, of, the, desert, this, term, is, usually, applied, to, de, gaulle, s, decline, in, influence, for, a, similar, period, indeed, in, the, second, round, of, the, legislative, election, fran, ois, mitterrand, was, supported, by, the, communists, but, the, french, section, of, the, workers, international, sfio, refused, to, withdraw, its, candidate, this, division, caused, the, election, of, the, gaullist, candidate, one, year, later, he, was, elected, to, represent, ni, vre, in, the, senate, where, he, was, part, of, the, group, of, the, democratic, left, at, the, same, time, he, was, not, admitted, to, the, ranks, of, the, unified, socialist, party, parti, socialiste, unifi, psu, which, was, created, by, mend, s, france, former, internal, opponents, of, mollet, and, reform, minded, former, members, of, the, communist, party, the, psu, leaders, justified, their, decision, by, referring, to, his, non, resignation, from, mollet, s, cabinet, and, by, his, past, in, vichy, also, in, that, same, year, on, the, avenue, de, l, observatoire, in, paris, mitterrand, claimed, to, have, escaped, an, assassin, s, bullet, by, diving, behind, a, hedge, in, what, became, known, as, the, observatory, affair, the, incident, brought, him, a, great, deal, of, publicity, initially, boosting, his, political, ambitions, some, of, mitterrand, s, critics, claimed, however, that, he, had, staged, the, incident, himself, resulting, in, a, backlash, against, him, he, later, said, he, had, earlier, been, warned, by, right, wing, deputy, robert, pesquet, that, he, was, the, target, of, an, alg, rie, fran, aise, death, squad, and, accused, prime, minister, michel, debr, of, being, its, instigator, before, his, death, pesquet, claimed, that, mitterrand, had, set, up, a, fake, attempt, on, his, life, prosecution, was, initiated, against, fran, ois, mitterrand, but, was, later, dropped, nonetheless, the, observatory, affair, cast, a, lasting, shadow, over, mitterrand, s, reputation, years, later, in, 1965, when, fran, ois, mitterrand, emerged, as, the, challenger, to, de, gaulle, in, the, second, round, of, the, presidential, elections, de, gaulle, was, urged, by, an, aide, to, use, the, observatory, affair, to, discredit, his, opponent, no, and, don, t, insist, was, the, general, s, response, it, would, be, wrong, to, demean, the, office, of, the, presidency, since, one, day, he, may, have, the, job, mitterrand, visited, china, in, 1961, during, the, worst, of, the, great, chinese, famine, but, denied, the, existence, of, starvation, in, the, 1962, election, mitterrand,

indochina, but, the, second, term, was, also, marked, by, rivalries, within, the, ps, and, the, split, of, the, mitterrandist, group, at, the, rennes, congress, where, supporters, of, laurent, fabius, and, lionel, jospin, clashed, bitterly, for, control, of, the, party, the, scandals, about, the, financing, of, the, party, the, contaminated, blood, scandal, which, implicated, laurent, fabius, and, former, ministers, georgina, dufoix, and, emond, herv, and, the, elys, e, wiretaps, affairs, disappointed, with, rocard, s, apparent, failure, to, enact, the, socialists, programme, mitterrand, dismissed, michel, rocard, in, 1991, and, appointed, dith, cresson, to, replace, him, she, was, the, first, woman, to, become, prime, minister, in, france, but, proved, a, costly, mistake, due, to, her, tendency, for, making, acerbic, and, racist, public, remarks, after, the, socialists, experienced, heavy, losses, in, the, 1992, regional, elections, cresson, resigned, from, office, her, successor, pierre, b, r, govoy, promised, to, fight, unemployment, and, corruption, but, he, could, not, prevent, the, catastrophic, defeat, of, the, left, in, the, 1993, legislative, election, the, socialist, party, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, with, the, right, wing, parties, winning, 485, seats, to, the, left, s, 95, he, killed, himself, on, 1, may, 1993, mitterrand, named, the, former, rpr, finance, minister, edouard, balladur, as, prime, minister, the, second, cohabitation, was, less, contentious, than, the, first, because, the, two, men, knew, they, were, not, rivals, for, the, next, presidential, election, by, this, point, fran, ois, mitterrand, was, nearly, 80, years, old, and, suffering, from, cancer, in, addition, to, the, shock, of, his, friend, fran, ois, de, grossouvre, s, suicide, his, second, and, last, term, ended, after, the, 1995, presidential, election, in, may, 1995, with, the, election, of, jacques, chirac, socialist, candidate, lionel, jospin, lost, the, presidential, election, overall, as, president, mitterrand, maintained, the, basic, characteristic, of, a, strong, welfare, base, underpinned, by, a, strong, state, a, united, nations, human, development, report, concluded, that, from, 1979, to, 1989, france, was, the, only, country, in, the, oecd, apart, from, portugal, in, which, income, inequalities, did, not, get, worse, during, his, second, term, as, president, however, the, gap, between, rich, and, poor, widened, in, france, with, both, unemployment, and, poverty, rising, in, the, awake, of, the, economic, recession, of, 1991, 1993, according, to, other, studies, though, the, percentage, of, the, french, population, living, in, poverty, based, on, various, criteria, fell, between, the, mid, eighties, and, the, mid, nineties, according, to, wayne, northcutt, certain, domestic, circumstances, helped, shape, mitterrand, s, foreign, policy, in, four, ways, he, needed, to, maintain, a, political, consensus, he, kept, an, eye, on, economic, conditions, he, believed, in, the, nationalistic, imperative, for, french, policy, and, he, tried, to, exploit, gaullism, and, its, heritage, for, political, advantage, fran, ois, mitterrand, supported, closer, european, collaboration, and, the, preservation, of, france, s, unique, relationship, with, its, former, colonies, which, he, feared, were, falling, under, anglo, saxon, influence, his, drive, to, preserve, french, power, in, africa, led, to, controversies, concerning, paris, role, during, the, rwandan, genocide, despite, mitterrand, s, left, wing, affiliations, the, 1980s, saw, france, becoming, more, distant, from, the, ussr, especially, following, events, such, as, the, expulsion, of, 47, soviet, diplomats, and, their, families, from, the, country, in, 1982, after, they, were, accused, of, large, scale, industrial, and, military, espionage, fran, ois, mitterrand, also, sharply, criticized, the, soviet, intervention, in, afghanistan, as, well, as, the, country, s, nuclear, weapons, buildup, when, fran, ois, mitterrand, visited, the, ussr, in, november, 1988, the, soviet, media, claimed, to, be, leaving, aside, the, virtually, wasted, decade, and, the, loss, of, the, soviet, french, special, relationship, of, the, gaullist, era, nevertheless, mitterrand, was, worried, by, the, rapidity, of, the, eastern, bloc, s, collapse, he, was, opposed, to, german, reunification, but, came, to, see, it, as, unavoidable, he, was, opposed, to, the, swift, recognition, of, croatia, and, slovenia, which, he, thought, would, lead, to, the, violent, implosion, of, yugoslavia, france, participated, in, the, gulf, war, 1990, 1991, with, the, u, n, coalition, he, initially, opposed, further, membership, fearing, the, community, was, not, ready, and, it, would, water, it, down, to, a, free, trade, area, mitterrand, supported, the, enlargement, of, the, community, to, include, spain, and, portugal, which, both, joined, in, january, 1986, in, february, 1986, he, helped, the, single, european, act, come, into, effect, he, worked, well, with, his, friend, helmut, kohl, and, improved, franco, german, relations, significantly, together, they, fathered, the, maastricht, treaty, which, was, signed, on, 7, february, 1992, it, was, ratified, by, referendum, approved, by, just, over, 51, of, the, voters, british, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, was, against, a, german, reunification, and, also, against, the, then, discussed, maastricht, treaty, when, kohl, then, west, german, chancellor, asked, fran, ois, mitterrand, to, agree, to, reunification, france, was, one, of, the, four, allies, who, had, to, agree, to, the, two, plus, four, treaty, fran, ois, mitterrand, told, kohl, he, accepted, it, only, in, the, event, germany, would, abandon, the, deutsche, mark, and, adopt, the, euro, kohl, accepted, this, package, deal, including, without, talking, to, karl, otto, p, hl, then, president, of, the, bundesbank, that, year, he, also, established, the, mitterrand, doctrine, a, policy, of, not, extraditing, convicted, far, left, terrorists, of, the, years, of, lead, such, as, cesare, battisti, to, italy, due, to, the, alleged, non, conformity, of, italian, legislation, to, european, standards, of, rule, of, law, in, particular, the, anti, terrorism, laws, passed, by, italy, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, when, the, european, court, of, human, rights, finally, ruled, against, the, fran, ois, mitterrand, doctrine, the, policy, had, already, led, to, most, of, the, criminals, never, being, punished, for, their, crimes, responding, to, a, democratic, movement, in, africa, after, the, 1989, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, he, made, his, la, baule, speech, in, june, 1990, which, tied, development, aid, to, democratic, efforts, from, former, french, colonies, and, during, which, he, opposed, the, devaluation, of, the, cfa, franc, seeing, an, east, wind, blowing, in, the, former, soviet, union, and, eastern, europe, he, stated, that, a, southern, wind, was, also, blowing, in, africa, and, that, state, leaders, had, to, respond, to, the, populations, wishes, and, aspirations, by, a, democratic, opening, which, included, a, representative, system, free, elections, multipartyism, freedom, of, the, press, an, independent, judiciary, and, abolition, of, censorship, claiming, that, france, was, the, country, making, the, most, important, effort, concerning, development, aid, he, announced, that, the, least, developed, countries, ldcs, would, henceforth, receive, only, grants, from, france, as, opposed, to, loans, in, order, to, combat, the, massive, increase, of, third, world, debt, during, the, 1980s, he, likewise, limited, the, interest, rate, to, 5, on, french, loans, to, intermediate, income, countries, that, is, ivory, coast, congo, cameroon, and, gabon, he, also, criticized, interventionism, in, sovereign, matters, which, was, according, to, him, only, another, form, of, colonialism, however, according, to, fran, ois, mitterrand, this, did, not, imply, lessened, concern, on, the, part, of, paris, for, its, former, colonies, fran, ois, mitterrand, thus, continued, with, the, african, policy, of, de, gaulle, inaugurated, in, 1960, which, followed, the, relative, failure, of, the, 1958, creation, of, the, french, community, all, in, all, fran, ois, mitterrand, s, la, baule, speech, which, marked, a, relative, turning, point, in, france, s, policy, concerning, its, former, colonies, has, been, compared, with, the, 1956, loi, cadre, defferre, which, was, responding, to, anti, colonialist, feelings, african, heads, of, state, themselves, reacted, to, fran, ois, mitterrand, s, speech, at, most, with, indifference, omar, bongo, president, of, gabon, declared, that, he, would, rather, have, events, counsel, him, abdou, diouf, president, of, senegal, said, that, according, to, him, the, best, solution, was, a, strong, government, and, a, good, faith, opposition, the, president, of, chad, hiss, ne, habr, nicknamed, the, african, pinochet, claimed, that, it, was, contradictory, to, demand, that, african, states, should, simultaneously, carry, on, a, democratic, policy, and, social, and, economic, policies, which, limited, their, sovereignty, in, a, clear, allusion, to, the, international, monetary, fund, and, the, world, bank, s, structural, adjustment, programs, hassan, ii, the, king, of, morocco, said, for, his, part, that, africa, was, too, open, to, the, world, to, remain, indifferent, to, what, was, happening, around, it, but, that, western, countries, should, help, young, democracies, open, out, without, putting, a, knife, under, their, throat, without, a, brutal, transition, to, multipartyism, all, in, all, the, la, baule, speech, has, been, said, to, be, on, one, hand, one, of, the, foundations, of, political, renewal, in, africa, french, speaking, area, and, on, the, other, hand, cooperation, with, france, this, despite, incoherence, and, inconsistency, like, any, public, policy, controversy, surrounding, the, discovery, of, the, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, was, intense, after, american, researcher, robert, gallo, and, french, scientist, luc, montagnier, both, claimed, to, have, discovered, it, the, two, scientists, had, given, the, new, virus, different, names, the, controversy, was, eventually, settled, by, an, agreement, helped, along, by, the, mediation, of, dr, jonas, salk, between, president, ronald, reagan, and, fran, ois, mitterrand, which, gave, equal, credit, to, both, men, and, their, teams, in, october, 1985, to, commemorate, the, tricentenary, of, the, revocation, of, the, edict, of, nantes, mitterrand, gave, a, formal, apology, to, the, descendants, of, huguenots, around, the, world, at, the, same, time, a, special, postage, stamp, was, released, in, their, honour, the, stamp, states, that, france, is, the, home, of, the, huguenots, accueil, des, huguenots, hence, their, rights, were, finally, recognised, on, 2, february, 1993, in, his, capacity, as, co, prince, of, andorra, mitterrand, and, joan, mart, alanis, who, was, bishop, of, urgell, and, therefore, andorra, s, other, co, prince, signed, andorra, s, new, constitution, which, was, later, approved, by, referendum, in, the, principality, mitterrand, died, in, paris, on, 8, january, 1996, at, the, age, of, 79, from, prostate, cancer, a, condition, he, and, his, doctors, had, concealed, for, most, of, his, presidency, see, section, on, medical, secrecy, below, a, few, days, before, his, death, he, was, joined, by, family, members, and, close, friends, for, a, last, meal, that, attracted, controversy, because, in, addition, to, other, gourmet, dishes, it, included, the, serving, of, roast, ortolan, bunting, a, small, wild, songbird, that, is, a, protected, species, whose, sale, was, and, remains, illegal, in, france, the, day, of, the, funeral, was, declared, a,

delmas, laurent, fabius, maurice, couve, de, murville, michel, rocard, pierre, mauroy, dith, cresson, were, present, sixty, one, heads, of, state, were, presented, fran, ois, mitterrand, s, grave, is, in, jarnac, former, leaders, and, foreign, delegations, who, attended, fran, ois, mitterrand, s, funeral, included, as, of, 2022, fran, ois, mitterrand, has, had, the, most, prime, ministers, during, the, regime, of, the, 5th, republic, following, his, death, a, controversy, erupted, when, his, former, physician, claude, gubler, wrote, a, book, called, le, grand, secret, the, grand, secret, explaining, that, fran, ois, mitterrand, had, false, health, reports, published, since, november, 1981, hiding, his, cancer, fran, ois, mitterrand, s, family, then, prosecuted, gubler, and, his, publisher, for, violating, medical, confidentiality, the, urba, consultancy, was, established, in, 1971, by, the, socialist, party, to, advise, socialist, led, communes, on, infrastructure, projects, and, public, works, the, urba, affair, became, public, in, 1989, when, two, police, officers, investigating, the, marseille, regional, office, of, urba, discovered, detailed, minutes, of, the, organisation, s, contracts, which, showed, a, division, of, proceeds, between, the, party, and, elected, officials, although, the, minutes, proved, a, direct, link, between, urba, and, corrupt, payments, to, politicians, an, edict, from, the, office, of, fran, ois, mitterrand, even, though, he, himself, was, listed, as, a, recipient, prevented, further, investigation, the, fran, ois, mitterrand, election, campaign, of, 1988, was, directed, by, henri, nallet, who, then, became, justice, minister, and, therefore, in, charge, of, the, investigation, at, national, level, in, 1990, fran, ois, mitterrand, declared, an, amnesty, for, those, under, investigation, thus, ending, the, affair, socialist, party, treasurer, henri, emmanuelli, was, tried, in, 1997, for, corruption, offences, for, which, he, received, a, two, year, suspended, sentence, from, 1982, to, 1986, fran, ois, mitterrand, established, an, anti, terror, cell, installed, as, a, service, of, the, president, of, the, republic, this, was, an, unusual, set, up, since, such, law, enforcement, missions, against, terrorism, are, normally, left, to, the, national, police, and, gendarmerie, run, under, the, cabinet, and, the, prime, minister, and, under, the, supervision, of, the, judiciary, the, cell, was, largely, staffed, by, members, of, these, services, but, it, bypassed, the, normal, line, of, command, and, safeguards, three, thousand, conversations, concerning, 150, people, 7, for, reasons, judged, to, be, contestable, by, the, ensuing, court, process, were, recorded, between, january, 1983, and, march, 1986, by, this, anti, terrorist, cell, at, the, elys, e, palace, in, one, of, its, first, actions, the, cell, was, involved, in, the, irish, of, vincennes, affair, in, which, it,
