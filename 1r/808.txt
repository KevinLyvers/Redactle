was, caused, by, a, confusion, of, the, text, s, editor, and, its, originator, he, suggests, that, vishnugupta, was, a, redactor, of, the, original, work, of, kau, ilya, thomas, burrow, suggests, that, chanakya, and, kau, ilya, may, have, been, two, different, people, according, to, the, jain, account, chanakya, was, born, to, two, lay, jains, shravaka, named, chanin, and, chaneshvari, his, birthplace, was, the, chanaka, village, in, golla, vishaya, district, the, identity, of, golla, is, not, certain, but, hemachandra, states, that, chanakya, was, a, dramila, implying, that, he, was, a, native, of, south, india, chanakya, was, born, with, a, full, set, of, teeth, according, to, the, monks, this, was, a, sign, that, he, would, become, a, king, in, the, future, chanin, did, not, want, his, son, to, become, haughty, so, he, broke, chanakya, s, teeth, the, monks, prophesied, that, the, baby, would, go, on, to, become, a, power, behind, the, throne, chanakya, grew, up, to, be, a, learned, shravaka, and, married, a, brahmin, woman, her, relatives, mocked, her, for, being, married, to, a, poor, man, this, motivated, chanakya, to, visit, pataliputra, and, seek, donations, from, the, emperor, nanda, who, was, famous, for, his, generosity, towards, brahmins, while, waiting, for, the, emperor, at, the, imperial, court, chanakya, sat, on, the, emperor, s, throne, a, dasi, slave, woman, courteously, offered, chanakya, the, next, seat, but, chanakya, kept, his, kamandal, water, pot, on, it, while, remaining, seated, on, the, throne, the, servant, offered, him, a, choice, of, four, more, seats, but, each, time, he, kept, his, various, items, on, the, seats, refusing, to, budge, from, the, throne, finally, the, annoyed, servant, kicked, him, off, the, throne, enraged, chanakya, vowed, to, uproot, nanda, and, his, entire, establishment, like, a, great, wind, uproots, a, tree, chanakya, knew, that, he, was, prophesied, to, become, a, power, behind, the, throne, so, he, started, searching, for, a, person, worthy, of, being, a, king, while, wandering, he, did, a, favour, for, the, pregnant, daughter, of, a, village, chief, on, the, condition, that, her, child, would, belong, to, him, chandragupta, was, born, to, this, lady, when, chandragupta, grew, up, chanakya, came, to, his, village, and, saw, him, playing, king, among, a, group, of, boys, to, test, him, chanakya, asked, him, for, a, donation, the, boy, told, chanakya, to, take, the, cows, nearby, declaring, that, nobody, would, disobey, his, order, this, display, of, power, convinced, chanakya, that, chandragupta, was, the, one, worthy, of, being, a, king, chanakya, took, chandragupta, to, conquer, pataliputra, the, capital, of, nanda, he, assembled, an, army, using, the, wealth, he, had, acquired, through, alchemy, dhatuvada, visaradan, the, army, suffered, a, severe, defeat, forcing, chanakya, and, chandragupta, to, flee, the, battlefield, they, reached, a, lake, while, being, pursued, by, an, enemy, officer, chanakya, asked, chandragupta, to, jump, into, the, lake, and, disguised, himself, as, a, meditating, ascetic, when, the, enemy, soldier, reached, the, lake, he, asked, the, ascetic, if, he, had, seen, chandragupta, chanakya, pointed, at, the, lake, as, the, soldier, removed, his, armour, to, jump, into, the, lake, chanakya, took, his, sword, and, killed, him, when, chandragupta, came, out, of, the, water, chanakya, asked, him, what, went, through, your, mind, when, i, disclosed, your, location, to, the, enemy, chandragupta, replied, that, he, trusted, his, master, to, make, the, best, decision, this, convinced, chanakya, that, chandragupta, would, remain, under, his, influence, even, after, becoming, the, king, on, another, occasion, chanakya, similarly, escaped, the, enemy, by, chasing, away, a, washerman, and, disguising, himself, as, one, once, he, cut, open, the, belly, of, a, brahmin, who, had, just, eaten, food, and, took, out, the, food, to, feed, a, hungry, chandragupta, one, day, chanakya, and, chandragupta, overheard, a, woman, scolding, her, son, the, child, had, burnt, his, finger, by, putting, it, in, the, middle, of, a, bowl, of, hot, gruel, the, woman, told, her, son, that, by, not, starting, from, the, cooler, edges, he, was, being, foolish, like, chanakya, who, attacked, the, capital, before, conquering, the, bordering, regions, chanakya, realized, his, mistake, and, made, a, new, plan, to, defeat, nanda, he, formed, an, alliance, with, parvataka, the, king, of, a, mountain, kingdom, called, himavatkuta, offering, him, half, of, nanda, s, empire, after, securing, parvataka, s, help, chanakya, and, chandragupta, started, besieging, the, cities, other, than, pataliputra, one, particular, city, offered, a, strong, resistance, chanakya, entered, this, city, disguised, as, a, shaivite, mendicant, and, declared, that, the, siege, would, end, if, the, idols, of, the, seven, mothers, were, removed, from, the, town, s, temple, as, soon, as, the, superstitious, defenders, removed, the, idols, from, the, temple, chanakya, ordered, his, army, to, end, the, siege, when, the, defenders, started, celebrating, their, victory, chanakya, s, army, launched, a, surprise, attack, and, captured, the, town, gradually, chanakya, and, chandragupta, subdued, all, the, regions, outside, the, capital, finally, they, captured, pataliputra, and, chandragupta, became, the, emperor, they, allowed, the, emperor, nanda, to, go, into, exile, with, all, the, goods, he, could, take, on, a, cart, as, nanda, and, his, family, were, leaving, the, city, on, a, cart, his, daughter, saw, chandragupta, and, fell, in, love, with, the, new, emperor, she, chose, him, as, her, husband, by, svayamvara, tradition, as, she, was, getting, off, the, cart, 9, spokes, of, the, cart, s, wheel, broke, interpreting, this, as, an, omen, chanakya, declared, that, chandragupta, s, dynasty, would, last, for, 9, generations, meanwhile, parvataka, fell, in, love, with, one, of, nanda, s, visha, kanyas, poison, girl, assassin, chanakya, approved, the, marriage, and, parvataka, collapsed, when, he, touched, the, girl, during, the, wedding, chanakya, asked, chandragupta, not, to, call, a, physician, thus, parvataka, died, and, chandragupta, became, the, sole, ruler, of, nanda, s, territories, chanakya, then, started, consolidating, the, power, by, eliminating, nanda, s, loyalists, who, had, been, harassing, people, in, various, parts, of, the, empire, chanakya, learned, about, a, weaver, who, would, burn, any, part, of, his, house, infested, with, cockroaches, chanakya, assigned, the, responsibility, of, crushing, the, rebels, to, this, weaver, soon, the, empire, was, free, of, insurgents, chanakya,

monks, chanakya, decided, to, prove, to, him, that, these, men, were, not, worthy, of, his, patronage, he, covered, the, floor, of, the, palace, area, near, the, women, s, rooms, with, powder, and, left, the, non, jain, monks, there, their, footprints, showed, that, they, had, sneaked, up, to, the, windows, of, the, women, s, rooms, to, peep, inside, the, jain, monks, who, were, assessed, using, the, same, method, stayed, away, from, the, women, s, rooms, after, seeing, this, chandragupta, appointed, the, jain, monks, as, his, spiritual, counsellors, chanakya, used, to, mix, small, doses, of,

his, ministers, however, subandhu, wanted, to, become, a, higher, minister, and, grew, jealous, of, chanakya, so, he, told, bindusara, that, chanakya, was, responsible, for, the, death, of, his, mother, bindusara, confirmed, the, allegations, with, the, nurses, who, told, him, that, chanakya, had, cut, open, the, belly, of, his, mother, bindusara, became, enraged, and, started, hating, chanakya, as, a, result, chanakya, who, had, grown, very, old, by, this, time, retired, and, decided, to, starve, himself, to, death, meanwhile, bindusara, learned, the, detailed, circumstances, of,

have, to, either, become, a, monk, or, face, death, subandhu, tested, the, perfume, on, another, man, and, then, fed, him, luxurious, food, something, that, the, monks, abstain, from, the, man, died,

disgusted, vararuchi, retired, to, a, forest, as, an, ascetic, shakatala, was, then, restored, as, the, minister, but, kept, planning, his, revenge, one, day, shakatala, came, across, chanakya, a, brahmin, who, was, uprooting, all, the, grass, in, his, path, because, one, blade, of, the, grass, had, pricked, his, foot, shakatala, realized, that, he, could, use, a, man, so, vengeful, to, destroy, the, fake, emperor, he, invited, chanakya, to, the, emperor, s, assembly, promising, him, 100, 000, gold, coins, for, presiding, over, a, ritual, ceremony, shakatala, hosted, chanakya, in, his, own, house, and, treated, him, with, great, respect, but, the, day, chanakya, arrived, at, the, imperial, court, shakatala, got, another, brahmin, named, subandhu, to, preside, over, the,

the, new, emperor, in, kshemendra, s, version, it, is, chanakya, who, installs, chandragupta, as, the, new, emperor, shakatala, also, appointed, chanakya, as, the, imperial, priest, rajpurohita, having, achieved, his, revenge, he, then, retired, to, the, forest, as, an, ascetic, according, to, the, mudrarakshasa, version, the, emperor, nanda, once, removed, chanakya, from, the, first, seat, of, the, empire, this, possibly, refers, to, chanakya, s, expulsion, from, the, emperor, s, assembly, for, this, reason, chanakya, vowed, not, to, tie, his, top, knot, shikha, until, the, complete,

spy, bhagurayana, accompanied, malayaketu, pretending, to, be, his, friend, rakshasa, continued, to, plot, chandragupta, s, death, but, all, his, plans, were, foiled, by, chanakya, for, example, once, rakshasa, arranged, for, assassins, to, be, transported, to, chandragupta, s, bedroom, via, a, tunnel, chanakya, became, aware, of, them, by, noticing, a, trail, of, ants, carrying, the, leftovers, of, their, food, he, then, arranged, for, the, assassins, to, be, burned, to, death, meanwhile, parvata, s, brother, vairodhaka, became, the, ruler, of, his, emperor, chanakya, convinced, him, that, rakshasa, was, responsible, for, killing, his, brother, and, agreed, to, share, half, of, nanda, s, emperor, with, him, secretly, however, chanakya, hatched, a, plan, to, get, vairodhaka, killed, he,
