the, first, century, and, the, beginning, of, the, second, rabbi, akiva, was, a, leading, contributor, to, the, mishnah, and, to, midrash, halakha, he, is, referred, to, in, tosafot, as, rosh, la, hakhamim, chief, of, the, sages, he, was, executed, by, the, romans, in, the, aftermath, of, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, akiva, ben, joseph, written, in, the, babylonian, talmud, and, in, the, jerusalem, talmud, born, c, 50, ce, was, of, humble, parentage, according, to, some, sources, he, was, descended, from, converts, to, judaism, when, akiva, married, the, daughter, of, ben, kalba, sabua, a, wealthy, citizen, of, jerusalem, akiva, was, an, uneducated, shepherd, employed, by, him, the, first, name, of, akiva, s, wife, is, not, provided, in, earlier, sources, but, a, later, version, of, the, tradition, gives, it, as, rachel, she, stood, loyally, by, her, husband, during, the, period, of, his, late, initiation, into, rabbinic, studies, after, he, was, 40, years, of, age, and, in, which, akiva, dedicated, himself, to, the, study, of, torah, a, different, tradition, narrates, that, at, the, age, of, 40, akiva, attended, the, academy, of, his, native, town, lod, presided, over, by, eliezer, ben, hurcanus, hurcanus, was, a, neighbour, of, joseph, the, father, of, akiva, the, fact, that, eliezer, was, his, first, teacher, and, the, only, one, whom, akiva, later, designates, as, rabbi, is, of, importance, in, settling, the, date, of, akiva, s, birth, these, legends, set, the, beginning, of, his, years, of, study, at, about, 75, 80, besides, eliezer, akiva, studied, under, joshua, ben, hananiah, and, nachum, ish, gamzu, according, to, the, jerusalem, talmud, r, joshua, ordained, akiva, as, his, fellow, student, presumably, with, semikhah, akiva, was, on, equal, footing, with, gamaliel, ii, whom, he, later, met, rabbi, tarfon, was, considered, as, one, of, akiva, s, masters, but, the, pupil, outranked, his, teacher, and, he, became, one, of, akiva, s, greatest, admirers, akiva, remained, in, lod, as, long, as, eliezer, dwelt, there, and, then, moved, his, own, school, to, beneberak, akiva, also, lived, for, some, time, at, ziphron, modern, zafran, near, hamath, according, to, the, talmud, akiva, was, a, shepherd, for, ben, kalba, sabua, when, the, latter, s, daughter, noticed, his, modesty, and, fine, character, traits, she, offered, to, marry, him, if, he, would, agree, to, begin, studying, torah, as, at, the, time, he, was, 40, years, old, and, illiterate, when, her, father, found, out, she, was, secretly, betrothed, to, an, unlearned, man, he, was, furious, he, drove, his, daughter, out, of, his, house, swearing, that, he, would, never, help, her, while, akiva, remained, her, husband, akiva, and, his, wife, lived, in, such, poverty, that, they, used, straw, for, their, bed, the, talmud, relates, that, once, elijah, the, prophet, assumed, the, guise, of, a, poor, man, and, came, to, their, door, to, beg, for, some, straw, for, a, bed, for, his, wife, after, she, had, given, birth, when, akiva, and, his, wife, saw, that, there, were, people, even, poorer, than, they, rachel, said, to, him, go, and, become, a, scholar, by, agreement, with, his, wife, akiva, spent, twelve, years, away, from, home, pursuing, his, studies, he, would, make, a, living, by, cutting, wood, from, the, forest, selling, half, for, his, wife, s, and, children, s, wellbeing, and, using, the, other, half, for, keeping, a, fire, burning, at, night, to, keep, himself, warm, and, to, provide, light, thereby, for, his, own, studies, returning, at, the, end, of, twelve, years, accompanied, by, 12, 000, disciples, at, the, point, of, entering, his, home, he, overheard, his, wife, say, to, a, neighbour, who, was, critical, of, his, long, absence, if, i, had, my, wish, he, should, stay, another, twelve, years, at, the, academy, without, crossing, the, threshold, akiva, went, back, to, the, academy, he, returned, twelve, years, later, escorted, by, 24, 000, disciples, when, his, wife, went, out, to, greet, him, some, of, his, students, not, knowing, who, she, was, sought, to, restrain, her, but, akiva, exclaimed, let, her, alone, for, what, is, mine, and, yours, is, hers, she, deserves, the, credit, for, our, torah, study, not, knowing, who, he, was, ben, kalba, sabua, also, approached, akiva, and, asked, him, for, help, annulling, his, vow, to, disown, his, daughter, and, her, husband, akiva, asked, him, would, you, have, made, your, vow, if, you, had, known, that, he, would, become, a, great, scholar, ben, kalba, sabua, replied, had, i, known, that, he, would, learn, even, one, chapter, or, one, single, halakha, akiva, said, to, him, i, am, that, man, ben, kalba, sabua, fell, at, akiva, s, feet, and, gave, him, half, his, wealth, according, to, another, source, akiva, saw, that, at, some, future, time, he, would, take, in, marriage, the, wife, of, turnus, rufus, his, executioner, also, known, as, quintus, tineius, rufus, after, she, converted, to, judaism, for, which, reason, he, spat, on, the, ground, for, having, come, from, a, fetid, drop, smiled, at, her, conversion, and, wept, at, such, beauty, eventually, rotting, in, the, dust, after, death, the, motive, behind, this, marriage, is, not, given, the, greatest, tannaim, of, the, middle, of, the, second, century, came, from, akiva, s, school, notably, rabbi, meir, judah, bar, ilai, simeon, bar, yochai, jose, ben, halafta, eleazar, ben, shammua, and, rabbi, nehemiah, besides, these, akiva, had, many, disciples, whose, names, have, not, been, handed, down, but, the, aggadah, variously, gives, their, number, as, 12, 000, 24, 000, and, 48, 000, akiva, is, reported, to, have, had, a, rabbinic, relationship, with, rabban, gamaliel, dated, as, before, their, trip, to, rome, convinced, of, the, necessity, of, a, central, authority, for, judaism, akiva, became, a, devoted, adherent, and, friend, of, rabban, gamaliel, who, aimed, at, constituting, the, patriarch, the, true, spiritual, chief, of, the, jews, however, akiva, was, just, as, firmly, convinced, that, the, power, of, the, patriarch, must, be, limited, both, by, the, written, and, the, oral, law, the, interpretation, of, which, lay, in, the, hands, of, the, learned, and, he, was, accordingly, brave, enough, to, act, in, ritual, matters, in, rabban, gamaliel, s, own, house, contrary, to, the, decisions, of, rabban, gamaliel, himself, akiva, filled, the, office, of, an, overseer, of, the, poor, various, rabbinic, texts, testify, to, his, personal, qualities, such, as, benevolence, and, kindness, toward, the, sick, and, needy, in, 95, 96, ce, akiva, was, in, rome, and, some, time, before, 110, he, was, in, nehardea, during, his, travels, it, is, probable, that, he, visited, other, places, having, important, jewish, communities, akiva, allegedly, took, part, in, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, of, 132, 136, but, his, role, here, is, not, historically, determined, the, only, established, fact, concerning, akiva, s, connection, with, bar, kochba, is, that, he, regarded, bar, kochba, as, the, promised, messiah, this, is, the, only, evidence, of, active, participation, by, akiva, in, the, revolution, some, modern, scholars, argue, that, akiva, s, thousands, of, students, died, fighting, for, bar, kochba, but, this, opinion, was, first, formulated, by, nachman, krochmal, around, 200, years, ago, and, has, no, earlier, source, a, baraita, states, that, akiva, suffered, martyrdom, on, account, of, his, transgression, of, hadrian, s, edicts, against, the, practice, and, the, teaching, of, the, jewish, religion, being, sentenced, to, die, by, turnus, rufus, in, caesarea, as, this, story, credits, the, execution, to, religious, rather, than, political, reasons, it, may, be, evidence, against, akiva, s, having, a, role, in, the, revolt, akiva, s, death, occurred, after, several, years, of, imprisonment, which, places, it, at, about, 132, before, the, suppression, of, the, bar, kochba, revolution, otherwise, the, delay, of, the, romans, in, executing, him, would, be, quite, inexplicable, that, the, religious, interdicts, of, hadrian, preceded, the, overthrow, of, bar, kochba, is, shown, by, the, mekhilta, jewish, sources, relate, that, he, was, subjected, to, combing, a, roman, torture, in, which, the, victim, s, skin, was, flayed, with, iron, combs, the, death, of, akiva, is, usually, rendered, as, some, redacted, form, of, three, separate, versions, of, the, circumstances, each, version, shares, the, same, basic, plot, points, akiva, defies, the, roman, prohibition, on, teaching, torah, the, consul, turnus, rufus, orders, his, execution, akiva, is, flayed, alive, and, his, final, words, are, the, shema, prayer, the, most, common, version, of, akiva, s, death, is, that, the, roman, government, ordered, him, to, stop, teaching, torah, on, pain, of, death, and, that, he, refused, when, turnus, rufus, as, he, is, called, in, jewish, sources, ordered, akiva, s, execution, akiva, is, said, to, have, recited, his, prayers, calmly, though, suffering, agonies, and, when, rufus, asked, him, whether, he, was, a, sorcerer, since, he, felt, no, pain, akiva, replied, i, am, no, sorcerer, but, i, rejoice, at, the, opportunity, now, given, to, me, to, love, my, god, with, all, my, life, seeing, that, i, have, hitherto, been, able, to, love, him, only, with, all, my, means, and, with, all, my, might, he, began, reciting, the, shema, and, with, the, word, echad, one, he, expired, the, version, in, the, babylonian, talmud, tells, it, as, a, response, of, akiva, to, his, students, who, asked, him, how, he, could, yet, offer, prayers, to, god, he, says, to, them, all, my, life, i, was, worried, about, the, verse, with, all, your, soul, and, the, sages, expounded, this, to, signify, even, if, he, takes, away, your, soul, and, i, said, to, myself, when, will, i, ever, be, able, to, fulfil, this, command, and, now, that, i, am, finally, able, to, fulfil, it, i, should, not, then, he, said, the, shema, and, he, extended, the, final, word, echad, one, until, his, life, expired, with, that, word, a, heavenly, voice, went, out, and, announced, blessed, are, you, rabbi, akiva, that, your, life, expired, with, echad, another, legend, is, that, elijah, bore, the, body, by, night, to, caesarea, the, night, however, was, as, bright, as, the, finest, summer, s, day, when, they, arrived, elijah, and, joshua, entered, a, cavern, that, contained, a, bed, table, chair, and, lamp, and, deposited, akiva, s, body, there, no, sooner, had, they, left, it, than, the, cavern, closed, of, its, own, accord, so, that, no, one, has, found, it, since, rebbe, akiva, s, modern, day, tomb, is, located, in, tiberias, annually, on, the, night, of, lag, baomer, pilgrims, light, bonfires, at, the, tomb, of, rebbe, akiva, the, pilgrims, include, some, from, boston, massachusetts, a, tradition, reinstated, by, the, bostoner, rebbe, in, 1983, a, tannaitic, tradition, mentions, that, of, the, four, who, delved, into, the, pardes, legend, akiva, was, the, only, one, who, was, able, to, properly, absorb, this, wisdom, with, the, other, three, suffering, various, consequences, as, a, result, of, the, attempt, this, serves, at, least, to, show, how, strong, in, later, ages, was, the, recollection, of, akiva, s, philosophical, speculation, akiva, s, opinion, about, the, creation, of, man, is, recorded, in, pirkei, avot, akiva, s, ontology, is, based, upon, the, principle, that, man, was, created, that, is, not, in, the, image, of, god, which, would, be, but, after, an, image, after, a, primordial, type, or, philosophically, speaking, after, an, idea, what, philo, calls, in, agreement, with, judean, theology, the, first, heavenly, man, see, adam, admon, strict, monotheist, that, akiva, was, he, protested, against, any, comparison, of, god, with, the, angels, and, declared, the, plain, interpretation, of, as, meaning, like, one, of, us, to, be, arrant, blasphemy, it, is, quite, instructive, to, read, how, a, christian, of, akiva, s, generation, justin, martyr, calls, the, literal, interpretation, thus, objected, to, by, akiva, a, jewish, heretical, one, in, his, earnest, endeavours, to, insist, as, strongly, as, possible, upon, the, incomparable, nature, of, god, akiva, indeed, lowers, the, angels, somewhat, to, the, realms, of, mortals, and, alluding, to, psalms, 78, 25, maintains, that, manna, is, the, actual, food, of, the, angels, this, view, of, akiva, s, in, spite, of, the, energetic, protests, of, his, colleague, rabbi, ishmael, became, the, one, generally, accepted, by, his, contemporaries, from, his, views, as, to, the, relation, between, god, and, man, he, deduces, that, a, murderer, is, to, be, considered, as, committing, the, crime, against, the, divine, archetype, of, man, similarly, he, recognizes, as, the, chief, and, greatest, principle, of, judaism, the, command, thou, shalt, love, thy, neighbour, as, thyself, he, does, not, indeed, maintain, thereby, that, the, execution, of, this, command, is, equivalent, to, the, performance, of, the, whole, law, and, in, one, of, his, polemic, interpretations, of, scripture, he, protests, strongly, against, a, contrary, opinion, allegedly, held, by, christians, and, other, non, jews, since, the, diaspora, according, to, which, judaism, is, at, best, simply, morality, for, in, spite, of, his, philosophy, akiva, was, an, extremely, strict, and, national, jew, but, he, is, far, from, representing, strict, justice, as, the, only, attribute, of, god, in, agreement, with, the, ancient, israel, theology, of, the, the, attribute, of, justice, and, the, attribute, of, mercy, he, teaches, that, god, combines, goodness, and, mercy, with, strict, justice, hence, his, maxim, referred, to, above, god, rules, the, world, in, mercy, but, according, to, the, preponderance, of, good, or, bad, in, human, acts, as, to, the, question, concerning, the, frequent, sufferings, of, the, pious, and, the, prosperity, of, the, wicked, truly, a, burning, one, in, akiva, s, time, this, is, answered, by, the, explanation, that, the, pious, are, punished, in, this, life, for, their, few, sins, so, that, in, the, next, they, may, receive, only, reward, while, the, wicked, obtain, in, this, world, all, the, recompense, for, the, little, good, they, have, done, and, in, the, next, world, will, receive, only, punishment, for, their, misdeeds, consistent, as, akiva, always, was, his, ethics, and, his, views, of, justice, were, only, the, strict, consequences, of, his, philosophical, system, justice, as, an, attribute, of, god, must, also, be, exemplary, for, man, no, mercy, in, justice, is, his, basic, principle, in, the, doctrine, concerning, law, and, he, does, not, conceal, his, opinion, that, the, action, of, the, jews, in, taking, the, spoil, of, the, egyptians, is, to, be, condemned, akiva, was, instrumental, in, drawing, up, the, canon, of, the, tanakh, he, protested, strongly, against, the, canonicity, of, certain, of, the, apocrypha, the, wisdom, of, sirach, for, instance, in, which, passages, is, to, be, explained, according, to, kiddushin, 49a, and, according, to, its, aramaic, equivalent, so, that, akiva, s, utterance, reads, he, who, reads, aloud, in, the, synagogue, from, books, not, belonging, to, the, canon, as, if, they, were, canonical, etc, but, he, was, not, opposed, to, a, private, reading, of, the, apocrypha, as, is, evident, from, the, fact, that, he, himself, makes, frequent, use, of, sirach, akiva, stoutly, defended, however, the, canonicity, of, the, song, of, songs, and, esther, gr, tz, s, statements, respecting, akiva, s, attitude, toward, the, canonicity, of, the, song, of, songs, were, viewed, as, misconceptions, by, i, h, weiss, aquila, meanwhile, was, a, disciple, of, akiva, and, under, akiva, s, guidance, gave, the, greek, speaking, jews, a, rabbinical, bible, akiva, probably, also, provided, for, a, revised, text, of, the, targums, certainly, for, the, essential, base, of, the, targum, onkelos, which, in, matters, of, halakha, reflects, akiva, s, opinions, completely, akiva, worked, in, the, domain, of, the, halakha, both, in, the, systematization, of, its, traditional, material, and, in, its, further, development, the, condition, of, the, halakha, that, is, of, religious, praxis, and, indeed, of, judaism, in, general, was, a, very, precarious, one, at, the, turn, of, the, 1st, century, of, the, common, era, the, lack, of, any, systematized, collection, of, the, accumulated, halachot, rendered, impossible, any, presentation, of, them, in, a, form, suitable, for, practical, purposes, means, for, the, theoretical, study, of, the, halakha, were, also, scant, both, logic, and, exegesis, the, two, props, of, the, halakha, being, differently, conceived, by, the, various, rulings, tannaim, and, differently, taught, according, to, a, tradition, which, has, historical, confirmation, it, was, akiva, who, systematized, and, arranged, the, mishna, the, halakhic, codex, the, midrash, the, exegesis, of, the, halkha, and, the, halachot, the, logical, amplification, of, the, halakha, the, mishna, of, akiva, as, his, pupil, rabbi, meir, had, taken, it, from, him, became, the, basis, of, the, six, orders, of, the, mishna, the, mishnah, of, the, one, called, rabbi, akiva, mentioned, by, epiphanius, as, well, as, the, great, mishnayot, of, akiva, are, probably, not, to, be, understood, as, independent, mishnayot, existing, at, that, time, but, as, the, teachings, and, opinions, of, akiva, contained, in, the, officially, recognized, mishnayot, and, midrashim, at, the, same, time, it, is, fair, to, consider, the, mishnah, of, judah, ha, nasi, called, simply, the, mishnah, as, well, as, the, majority, of, all, halakhic, midrashim, now, extant, as, derived, from, the, school, of, akiva, according, to, jo, anan, bar, nappa, a, 199, 279, our, mishnah, comes, directly, from, rabbi, meir, the, tosefta, from, r, nehemiah, the, sifra, from, r, judah, and, the, sifre, from, r, simon, but, they, all, took, akiva, for, a, model, in, their, works, and, followed, him, one, recognizes, here, the, threefold, division, of, the, halakhic, material, that, emanated, from, akiva, 1, the, codified, halakhah, i, e, mishnah, 2, the, tosefta, which, in, its, original, form, contains, a, concise, logical, argument, for, the, mishnah, somewhat, like, the, lebush, of, mordecai, jafe, on, the, shulchan, aruch, 3, the, halakhic, midrash, the, following, halakhic, midrashim, originating, in, akiva, s, school, the, mekhilta, of, rabbi, shimon, on, exodus, sifra, on, leviticus, sifre, zu, a, on, numbers, and, the, sifre, to, deuteronomy, the, halakhic, portion, of, which, belongs, to, akiva, s, school, what, was, rabbi, akiva, like, a, worker, who, goes, out, with, his, basket, he, finds, wheat, he, puts, it, in, barley, he, puts, it, in, spelt, he, puts, it, in, beans, he, puts, it, in, lentils, he, puts, it, in, when, he, arrives, home, he, sorts, out, the, wheat, by, itself, barley, by, itself, spelt, by, itself, beans, by, themselves, lentils, by, themselves, so, did, rabbi, akiva, he, arranged, the, torah, rings, by, rings, admirable, as, is, the, systematization, of, the, halakha, by, akiva, his, hermeneutics, and, halakhic, exegesis, which, form, the, foundation, of, all, talmudic, learning, surpassed, it, the, enormous, difference, between, the, halakha, before, and, after, akiva, may, be, briefly, described, as, follows, the, old, halakha, was, as, its, name, indicates, the, religious, practice, sanctioned, as, binding, by, tradition, to, which, were, added, extensions, and, in, some, cases, limitations, of, the, torah, arrived, at, by, strict, logical, deduction, the, opposition, offered, by, the, sadducees, which, became, especially, strenuous, in, the, first, century, bc, led, to, the, development, of, the, halakhic, midrash, whose, purpose, was, to, deduce, these, amplifications, of, the, law, by, tradition, and, logic, out, of, the, law, itself, it, might, be, thought, that, with, the, destruction, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, which, event, made, an, end, of, sadduceeism, the, halakhic, midrash, would, also, have, disappeared, seeing, that, the, halakha, could, now, dispense, with, the, midrash, this, probably, would, have, been, the, case, had, not, akiva, created, his, own, midrash, by, means, of, which, he, was, able, to, discover, things, that, were, even, unknown, to, moses, akiva, made, the, accumulated, treasure, of, the, oral, law, which, until, his, time, was, only, a, subject, of, knowledge, and, not, a, science, an, inexhaustible, mine, from, which, by, the, means, he, provided, new, treasures, might, be, continually, extracted, if, the, older, halakha, is, to, be, considered, as, the, product, of, the, internal, struggle, between, phariseeism, and, sadduceeism, the, halakha, of, akiva, must, be, conceived, as, the, result, of, an, external, contest, between, judaism, on, the, one, hand, and, hellenism, and, hellenistic, christianity, on, the, other, akiva, no, doubt, perceived, that, the, intellectual, bond, uniting, the, jews, far, from, being, allowed, to, disappear, with, the, destruction, of, the, jewish, state, must, be, made, to, draw, them, closer, together, than, before, he, pondered, also, the, nature, of, that, bond, the, bible, could, never, again, fill, the, place, alone, for, the, christians, also, regarded, it, as, a, divine, revelation, still, less, could, dogma, serve, the, purpose, for, dogmas, were, always, repellent, to, rabbinical, judaism, whose, very, essence, is, development, and, the, susceptibility, to, development, mention, has, already, been, made, of, the, fact, that, akiva, was, the, creator, of, a, rabbinical, bible, version, elaborated, with, the, aid, of, his, pupil, aquila, though, this, is, traditionally, debated, and, designed, to, become, the, common, property, of, all, jews, but, this, was, not, sufficient, to, obviate, all, threatening, danger, it, was, to, be, feared, that, the, jews, by, their, facility, in, accommodating, themselves, to, surrounding, even, then, a, marked, characteristic, might, become, entangled, in, the, net, of, grecian, philosophy, and, even, in, that, of, gnosticism, the, example, of, his, colleagues, and, friends, elisha, ben, abuyah, ben, azzai, and, ben, zoma, strengthened, him, still, more, in, his, conviction, of, the, necessity, of, providing, some, counterpoise, to, the, intellectual, influence, of, the, non, jewish, world, akiva, sought, to, apply, the, system, of, isolation, followed, by, the, pharisees, those, who, separate, themselves, to, doctrine, as, they, did, to, practice, to, the, intellectual, life, as, they, did, to, that, of, daily, discourse, and, he, succeeded, in, furnishing, a, firm, foundation, for, his, system, as, the, fundamental, principle, of, his, system, akiva, enunciates, his, conviction, that, the, mode, of, expression, used, by, the, torah, is, quite, different, from, that, of, every, other, book, in, the, language, of, the, torah, nothing, is, mere, form, everything, is, essence, it, has, nothing, superfluous, not, a, word, not, a, syllable, not, even, a, letter, every, peculiarity, of, diction, every, particle, every, sign, is, to, be, considered, as, of, higher, importance, as, having, a, wider, relation, and, as, being, of, deeper, meaning, than, it, seems, to, have, like, philo, who, saw, in, the, hebrew, construction, of, the, infinitive, with, the, finite, form, of, the, same, verb, and, in, certain, particles, adverbs, prepositions, etc, some, deep, reference, to, philosophical, and, ethical, doctrines, akiva, perceived, in, them, indications, of, many, important, ceremonial, laws, legal, statutes, and, ethical, teachings, he, thus, gave, the, jewish, mind, not, only, a, new, field, for, its, own, employment, but, convinced, both, of, the, immutability, of, holy, scripture, and, of, the, necessity, for, development, in, judaism, he, succeeded, in, reconciling, these, two, apparently, hopeless, opposites, by, means, of, his, remarkable, method, the, following, two, illustrations, will, serve, to, make, this, clear, his, hermeneutics, frequently, put, him, at, odds, with, the, interpretation, of, his, colleagues, as, particularly, demonstrated, by, his, attitude, toward, the, samaritans, he, considered, friendly, discussion, with, these, potential, converts, as, desirable, on, political, as, well, as, on, religious, grounds, and, he, permitted, not, only, eating, their, bread, but, also, intermarriage, considering, them, as, full, converts, this, is, quite, remarkable, seeing, that, in, matrimonial, legislation, he, went, so, far, as, to, declare, every, forbidden, betrothal, as, absolutely, void, and, the, offspring, as, illegitimate, for, similar, reasons, akiva, rules, leniently, in, the, biblical, ordinance, of, kil, ayim, nearly, every, chapter, in, the, treatise, of, that, name, contains, a, mitigation, by, akiva, love, for, the, holy, land, which, he, as, a, genuine, nationalist, frequently, and, warmly, expressed, was, so, powerful, with, him, that, he, would, have, exempted, agriculture, from, much, of, the, rigour, of, the, law, these, examples, will, suffice, to, justify, the, opinion, that, akiva, was, the, man, to, whom, judaism, owes, pre, eminently, its, activity, and, its, capacity, for, further, development, in, accordance, with, the, tradition, he, received, when, moses, ascended, into, heaven, he, saw, god, preoccupied, with, making, ornamental, crowns, for, the, letters, of, the, torah, when, moses, inquired, what, the, purpose, of, these, embellishments, were, god, explained, that, a, man, named, akiva, would, be, born, in, several, generations, and, that, he, would, be, able, to, deduce, halakha, from, every, little, curve, and, crown, of, the, letters, of, the, law, moses, requested, that, he, be, allowed, to, see, this, man, and, god, assented, moses, found, himself, sitting, in, akiva, s, study, hall, as, moses, listened, to, akiva, s, lesson, he, grew, weary, because, he, could, not, understand, it, however, when, one, of, the, students, asked, akiva, for, the, source, of, his, teaching, akiva, replied, that, it, was, a, law, to, moses, at, sinai, and, moses, was, put, at, ease, when, moses, returns, to, god, and, asks, what, the, pious, akiva, s, ultimate, reward, will, be, he, is, shown, the, grisly, aftermath, of, akiva, s, execution, horrified, moses, demands, god, explain, his, actions, at, which, point, god, commands, moses, to, be, silent, and, respect, his, judgement, this, story, gives, a, picture, of, akiva, s, activity, as, the, father, of, talmudic, interpretation, tinnius, rufus, asked, which, is, the, more, beautiful, god, s, work, or, man, s, akiva, replied, undoubtedly, man, s, work, is, the, better, for, while, nature, at, god, s, command, supplies, us, only, with, the, raw, material, human, skill, enables, us, to, elaborate, the, same, according, to, the, requirements, of, art, and, good, taste, rufus, had, hoped, to, drive, akiva, into, a, corner, by, his, strange, question, for, he, expected, quite, a, different, answer, and, intended, to, compel, akiva, to, admit, the, wickedness, of, circumcision, he, then, put, the, question, why, has, god, not, made, man, just, as, he, wanted, him, to, be, akiva, had, an, answer, ready, for, the, very, reason, man, must, perfect, himself, the, aggadah, explains, how, akiva, in, the, prime, of, life, commenced, his, rabbinical, studies, legendary, allusion, to, this, change, in, akiva, s, life, is, made, in, two, slightly, varying, forms, likely, the, older, of, the, two, goes, as, follows, akiva, noticing, a, stone, at, a, well, that, had, been, hollowed, out, by, drippings, from, the, buckets, said, if, these, drippings, can, by, continuous, action, penetrate, this, solid, stone, how, much, more, can, the, persistent, word, of, god, penetrate, the, pliant, fleshly, human, heart, if, that, word, but, be, presented, with, patient, insistency, akiva, taught, thousands, of, students, on, one, occasion, twenty, four, thousand, students, of, his, died, in, a, plague, his, five, main, students, were, judah, bar, ilai, rabbi, meir, rabbi, eleazar, ben, shammua, jose, ben, halafta, and, shimon, bar, yochai, once, he, was, called, upon, to, decide, between, a, dark, skinned, king, and, the, king, s, wife, the, wife, having, been, accused, of, infidelity, after, bearing, a, white, child, akiva, ascertained, that, the, royal, chamber, was, adorned, with, white, marble, statuary, and, based, on, the, theory, that, a, child, is, similar, in, nature, to, whatever, its, parents, gazed, upon, while, conceiving, the, child, he, exonerated, the, queen, from, suspicion, it, is, related, that, during, his, stay, in, rome, akiva, became, intimately, acquainted, with, the, jewish, proselyte, ketia, bar, shalom, a, very, influential, roman, according, to, some, scholars, identical, with, flavius, clemens, domitian, s, nephew, who, before, his, execution, for, pleading, the, cause, of, the, jews, bequeathed, to, akiva, all, his, possessions, the, talmud, enumerates, six, occasions, in, which, akiva, gained, wealth, in, one, case, his, success, as, a, teacher, led, his, wealthy, father, in, law, kalba, savua, to, acknowledge, such, a, distinguished, son, in, law, and, to, support, him, another, source, of, his, wealth, was, said, to, be, a, large, sum, of, money, borrowed, from, a, heathen, woman, a, matrona, as, bondsmen, for, the, loan, akiva, named, god, and, the, sea, on, the, shore, of, which, the, matrona, s, house, stood, akiva, being, sick, could, not, return, the, money, at, the, time, appointed, but, his, bondsmen, did, not, leave, him, in, the, lurch, an, imperial, princess, suddenly, became, insane, in, which, condition, she, threw, a, chest, containing, imperial, treasures, into, the, sea, it, was, cast, upon, the, shore, close, to, the, house, of, akiva, s, creditor, so, that, when, the, matrona, went, to, the, shore, to, demand, of, the, sea, the, amount, she, had, lent, akiva, the, ebbing, tide, left, boundless, riches, at, her, feet, later, when, akiva, arrived, to, discharge, his, indebtedness, the, matrona, not, only, refused, to, accept, the, money, but, insisted, upon, akiva, s, receiving, a, large, share, of, what, the, sea, had, brought, to, her, this, was, not, the, only, occasion, on, which, akiva, was, made, to, feel, the, truth, of, his, favourite, maxim, whatever, god, does, he, does, for, the, best, once, being, unable, to, find, any, sleeping, accommodation, in, a, certain, city, he, was, compelled, to, pass, the, night, outside, its, walls, without, a, murmur, he, resigned, himself, to, this, hardship, and, even, when, a, lion, devoured, his, donkey, and, a, cat, killed, the, rooster, whose, crowing, was, to, herald, the, dawn, to, him, and, the, wind, extinguished, his, candle, the, only, remark, he, made, was, all, that, god, does, is, for, the, good, when, morning, dawned, he, learned, how, true, his, words, were, a, band, of, robbers, had, fallen, upon, the, city, and, carried, its, inhabitants, into, captivity, but, he, had, escaped, because, his, abiding, place, had, not, been, noticed, in, the, darkness, and, neither, beast, nor, fowl, had, betrayed, him, another, legend, according, to, which, the, gates, of, the, infernal, regions, opened, for, akiva, is, analogous, to, the, more, familiar, tale, that, he, entered, paradise, and, was, allowed, to, leave, it, unscathed, there, exists, the, following, tradition, akiva, once, met, a, coal, black, man, carrying, a, heavy, load, of, wood, and, running, with, the, speed, of, a, horse, akiva, stopped, him, and, inquired, my, son, why, do, you, work, so, hard, if, you, are, a, slave, and, have, a, harsh, master, i, will, buy, you, from, him, if, it, be, out, of, poverty, that, you, do, this, i, will, take, care, of, your, needs, it, is, for, neither, of, these, the, man, replied, i, am, dead, and, am, compelled, because, of, my, great, sins, to, build, my, funeral, pyre, every, day, in, life, i, was, a, tax, gatherer, and, oppressed, the, poor, let, me, go, at, once, lest, the, demon, tortures, me, for, my, delay, is, there, no, help, for, you, asked, akiva, almost, none, replied, the, deceased, for, i, understand, that, my, sufferings, will, end, only, when, i, have, a, pious, son, when, i, died, my, wife, was, pregnant, but, i, have, little, hope, that, she, will, give, my, child, proper, training, akiva, inquired, about, the, man, s, name, and, that, of, his, wife, and, her, dwelling, place, when, in, the, course, of, his, travels, he, reached, the, place, akiva, sought, information, concerning, the, man, s, family, the, neighbours, very, freely, expressed, their, opinion, that, the, deceased, and, his, wife, deserved, to, inhabit, the, infernal, regions, for, all, time, the, latter, because, she, had, not, even, performed, brit, milah, for, the, child, akiva, however, was, not, to, be, turned, from, his, purpose, he, sought, the, son, of, the, tax, gatherer, and, laboured, long, and, assiduously, in, teaching, him, the, word, of, god, after, fasting, for, 40, days, and, praying, to, god, to, bless, his, efforts, he, heard, a, heavenly, voice, bat, kol, asking, why, do, you, go, to, so, much, trouble, on, behalf, of, this, person, because, he, is, just, the, kind, to, work, for, was, the, prompt, answer, akiva, persevered, until, his, pupil, was, able, to, officiate, as, a, reader, in, the, synagogue, and, when, there, for, the, first, time, he, recited, the, prayer, bless, the, lord, the, father, suddenly, appeared, to, akiva, and, overwhelmed, him, with, thanks, for, his, deliverance, from, the, pains, of, hell, through, the, merit, of, his, son, this, legend, has, been, somewhat,
