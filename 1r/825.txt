pierre, bourdieu, french, 1, august, 1930, 23, january, 2002, was, a, french, sociologist, and, public, intellectual, bourdieu, s, contributions, to, the, sociology, of, education, the, theory, of, sociology, and, sociology, of, aesthetics, have, achieved, wide, influence, in, several, related, academic, fields, e, g, anthropology, media, and, cultural, studies, education, popular, culture, and, the, arts, during, his, academic, career, he, was, primarily, associated, with, the, school, for, advanced, studies, in, the, social, sciences, in, paris, and, the, coll, ge, de, france, bourdieu, s, work, was, primarily, concerned, with, the, dynamics, of, power, in, society, especially, the, diverse, and, subtle, ways, in, which, power, is, transferred, and, social, order, is, maintained, within, and, across, generations, in, conscious, opposition, to, the, idealist, tradition, of, much, of, western, philosophy, his, work, often, emphasized, the, corporeal, nature, of, social, life, and, stressed, the, role, of, practice, and, embodiment, in, social, dynamics, building, upon, and, criticizing, the, theories, of, karl, marx, sigmund, freud, max, weber, mile, durkheim, claude, l, vi, strauss, erwin, panofsky, and, marcel, mauss, among, others, his, research, pioneered, novel, investigative, frameworks, and, methods, and, introduced, such, influential, concepts, as, cultural, social, and, symbolic, forms, of, capital, as, opposed, to, traditional, economic, forms, of, capital, the, cultural, reproduction, the, habitus, the, field, or, location, and, symbolic, violence, another, notable, influence, on, bourdieu, was, blaise, pascal, after, whom, bourdieu, titled, his, pascalian, meditations, bourdieu, was, a, prolific, author, producing, hundreds, of, articles, and, three, dozen, books, nearly, all, of, which, are, now, available, in, english, his, best, known, book, is, distinction, a, social, critique, of, the, judgment, of, taste, 1979, in, which, he, argues, that, judgments, of, taste, are, related, to, social, position, or, more, precisely, are, themselves, acts, of, social, positioning, the, argument, is, put, forward, by, an, original, combination, of, social, theory, and, data, from, quantitative, surveys, photographs, and, interviews, in, an, attempt, to, reconcile, difficulties, such, as, how, to, understand, the, subject, within, objective, structures, in, the, process, bourdieu, attempts, to, reconcile, the, influences, of, both, external, social, structures, and, subjective, experience, on, the, individual, the, book, was, named, the, sixth, most, important, sociological, work, of, the, twentieth, century, by, the, international, sociological, association, isa, pierre, bourdieu, s, work, emphasized, how, social, classes, especially, the, ruling, and, intellectual, classes, preserve, their, social, privileges, across, generations, despite, the, myth, that, contemporary, post, industrial, society, boasts, equality, of, opportunity, and, high, social, mobility, achieved, through, formal, education, pierre, bourdieu, was, born, in, denguin, pyr, n, es, atlantiques, in, southern, france, to, a, postal, worker, and, his, wife, the, household, spoke, b, arnese, a, gascon, dialect, in, 1962, bourdieu, married, marie, claire, brizard, and, the, couple, would, go, on, to, have, three, sons, j, r, me, emmanuel, and, laurent, bourdieu, was, educated, at, the, lyc, e, louis, barthou, in, pau, before, moving, to, the, lyc, e, louis, le, grand, in, paris, from, there, he, gained, entrance, to, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, ens, also, in, paris, where, he, studied, philosophy, alongside, louis, althusser, after, getting, his, agr, gation, bourdieu, worked, as, a, lyc, e, teacher, at, moulins, for, a, year, before, his, conscription, into, the, french, army, in, 1955, his, biographers, write, that, he, chose, not, to, enter, the, reserve, officer, s, college, like, many, of, his, fellow, ens, graduates, as, he, wished, to, stay, with, people, from, his, own, modest, social, background, deployed, to, algeria, in, october, 1955, during, its, war, of, independence, from, france, bourdieu, served, in, a, unit, guarding, military, installations, before, being, transferred, to, clerical, work, after, his, year, long, military, service, bourdieu, stayed, on, as, a, lecturer, in, algiers, during, the, algerian, war, in, 1958, 1962, bourdieu, undertook, ethnographic, research, into, the, clash, through, a, study, of, the, kabyle, peoples, of, the, berbers, laying, the, groundwork, for, his, anthropological, reputation, the, result, was, his, first, book, sociologie, de, l, alg, rie, 1958, the, sociology, of, algeria, which, became, an, immediate, success, in, france, and, was, published, in, america, in, 1962, he, later, drew, heavily, on, this, fieldwork, in, his, 1972, book, outline, of, a, theory, of, practice, a, strong, intervention, into, anthropological, theory, bourdieu, routinely, sought, to, connect, theoretical, ideas, with, empirical, research, and, his, work, can, be, seen, as, sociology, of, culture, or, as, he, described, it, a, theory, of, practice, his, contributions, to, sociology, were, both, evidential, and, theoretical, i, e, calculated, through, both, systems, his, key, terms, would, be, habitus, capital, and, field, he, extended, the, idea, of, capital, to, categories, such, as, social, capital, cultural, capital, financial, capital, and, symbolic, capital, for, bourdieu, each, individual, occupies, a, position, in, a, multidimensional, social, space, a, person, is, not, defined, only, by, social, class, membership, but, by, every, single, kind, of, capital, he, can, articulate, through, social, relations, that, capital, includes, the, value, of, social, networks, which, bourdieu, showed, could, be, used, to, produce, or, reproduce, inequality, in, 1960, bourdieu, returned, to, the, university, of, paris, before, gaining, a, teaching, position, at, the, university, of, lille, where, he, remained, until, 1964, from, 1964, onwards, bourdieu, held, the, position, of, professor, directeur, d, tudes, in, the, vie, section, of, the, cole, pratique, des, hautes, tudes, the, future, cole, des, hautes, tudes, en, sciences, sociales, and, from, 1981, the, chair, of, sociology, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, held, before, him, by, raymond, aron, and, maurice, halbwachs, in, 1968, bourdieu, took, over, the, centre, de, sociologie, europ, enne, founded, by, aron, which, he, directed, until, his, death, in, 1975, with, the, research, group, he, had, formed, at, the, centre, de, sociologie, europ, enne, he, launched, the, interdisciplinary, journal, actes, de, la, recherche, en, sciences, sociales, with, which, he, sought, to, transform, the, accepted, canons, of, sociological, production, while, buttressing, the, scientific, rigor, of, sociology, in, 1993, he, was, honored, with, the, m, daille, d, or, du, centre, national, de, la, recherche, scientifique, cnrs, in, 1996, he, received, the, goffman, prize, from, the, university, of, california, berkeley, and, in, 2001, the, huxley, medal, of, the, royal, anthropological, institute, bourdieu, died, of, cancer, at, the, age, of, 71, much, of, bourdieu, s, work, observes, the, role, of, educational, and, cultural, resources, in, the, expression, of, agency, bourdieu, was, in, practice, both, influenced, by, and, sympathetic, to, the, marxist, identification, of, economic, command, as, a, principal, component, of, power, and, agency, within, capitalist, society, bourdieu, s, anthropological, work, was, dominated, by, social, hierarchy, reproduction, analysis, bourdieu, criticized, the, importance, given, to, economic, factors, in, the, analysis, of, social, order, and, change, he, stressed, instead, that, the, capacity, of, actors, to, impose, their, cultural, reproductions, and, symbolic, systems, plays, an, essential, role, in, the, reproduction, of, dominant, social, structures, symbolic, violence, is, the, self, interested, capacity, to, ensure, that, the, arbitrariness, of, the, social, order, is, either, ignored, or, argued, as, natural, thereby, justifying, the, legitimacy, of, existing, social, structures, this, concept, plays, an, essential, part, in, his, sociological, analysis, which, emphasizes, the, importance, of, practices, in, the, social, world, bourdieu, was, opposed, to, the, intellectualist, tradition, and, stressed, that, social, domination, and, cultural, reproduction, were, primarily, focused, on, bodily, know, how, and, competent, practices, in, the, society, bourdieu, fiercely, opposed, rational, choice, theory, because, he, believed, it, was, a, misunderstanding, of, how, social, agents, operate, bourdieu, s, work, is, influenced, by, much, of, traditional, anthropology, and, sociology, which, he, undertook, to, synthesize, into, his, own, theory, from, max, weber, he, retained, an, emphasis, on, the, dominance, of, symbolic, systems, in, social, life, as, well, as, the, idea, of, social, orders, which, would, ultimately, be, transformed, by, bourdieu, from, a, sociology, of, religion, into, a, theory, of, fields, from, marx, he, gained, his, understanding, of, society, as, the, ensemble, of, social, relationships, what, exist, in, the, social, world, are, relations, not, interactions, between, agents, or, intersubjective, ties, between, individuals, but, objective, relations, which, exist, independently, of, individual, consciousness, and, will, 97, grounded, in, the, mode, and, conditions, of, economic, production, and, of, the, need, to, dialectically, develop, social, theory, from, social, practice, arnold, hauser, earlier, published, the, orthodox, application, of, marxist, class, theory, to, the, fine, arts, in, the, social, history, of, art, 1951, from, mile, durkheim, through, marcel, mauss, and, claude, l, vi, strauss, bourdieu, inherited, a, certain, structuralist, interpretation, of, the, tendency, of, social, structures, to, reproduce, themselves, based, on, the, analysis, of, symbolic, structures, and, forms, of, classification, however, bourdieu, critically, diverged, from, durkheim, in, emphasizing, the, role, of, the, social, agent, in, enacting, through, the, embodiment, of, social, structures, symbolic, orders, he, furthermore, emphasized, that, the, reproduction, of, social, structures, does, not, operate, according, to, a, functionalist, logic, maurice, merleau, ponty, and, through, him, the, phenomenology, of, edmund, husserl, played, an, essential, part, in, the, formulation, of, bourdieu, s, focus, on, the, body, action, and, practical, dispositions, which, found, their, primary, manifestation, in, bourdieu, s, theory, of, habitus, bourdieu, was, also, influenced, by, wittgenstein, especially, with, regard, to, his, work, on, rule, following, stating, that, wittgenstein, is, probably, the, philosopher, who, has, helped, me, most, at, moments, of, difficulty, he, s, a, kind, of, saviour, for, times, of, great, intellectual, distress, bourdieu, s, work, is, built, upon, an, attempt, to, transcend, a, series, of, oppositions, which, he, thought, characterized, the, social, sciences, subjectivism, objectivism, micro, macro, freedom, determinism, of, his, time, his, concepts, of, habitus, capital, and, field, were, conceived, with, the, intention, of, overcoming, such, oppositions, during, the, 1990s, bourdieu, became, more, and, more, involved, in, political, debate, becoming, one, of, the, most, important, public, faces, of, intellectual, life, in, france, while, a, fierce, critic, of, neoliberalism, bourdieu, was, also, critical, of, the, total, intellectual, role, played, by, jean, paul, sartre, and, he, dismissed, sartre, s, attempts, to, intervene, in, french, politics, as, irresponsible, and, opportunistic, bourdieu, saw, sociology, not, as, a, form, of, intellectual, entertainment, but, as, a, serious, discipline, of, a, scientific, nature, there, is, an, apparent, contradiction, between, bourdieu, s, earlier, writings, against, using, sociology, for, political, activism, and, his, later, launch, into, the, role, of, a, public, intellectual, with, some, highly, visible, political, statements, although, much, of, his, early, work, stressed, the, importance, of, treating, sociology, as, a, strict, scientific, discipline, la, sociologie, est, un, sport, de, combat, transl, sociology, is, a, martial, art, his, later, career, saw, him, enter, the, less, academic, world, of, political, debate, in, france, raising, the, issue, of, whether, the, sociologist, has, political, responsibilities, extending, to, the, public, domain, although, bourdieu, earlier, faulted, public, intellectuals, such, as, sartre, he, had, strong, political, views, which, influenced, his, sociology, from, the, beginning, by, the, time, of, his, later, work, his, main, concern, had, become, the, effect, of, globalisation, and, those, who, benefited, least, from, it, his, politics, then, became, more, overt, and, his, role, as, public, intellectual, was, born, from, an, urgency, to, speak, out, against, neoliberal, discourse, that, had, become, so, dominant, within, political, debate, bourdieu, developed, a, project, to, investigate, the, effects, particularly, the, harm, of, neoliberal, reforms, in, france, the, most, significant, fruit, of, this, project, was, the, 1993, study, the, weight, of, the, world, although, his, views, are, perhaps, more, candidly, expressed, in, his, articles, the, weight, of, the, world, represented, a, heavyweight, scientific, challenge, to, the, dominant, trends, in, french, politics, since, it, was, the, work, of, a, team, of, sociologists, it, also, shows, bourdieu, s, collaborative, character, indicating, that, he, was, still, in, 1993, reluctant, to, accept, being, singled, out, with, the, category, of, public, intellectual, nevertheless, bourdieu, s, activities, as, a, critical, sociologist, prepared, him, for, the, public, stage, fulfilling, his, constructionist, view, of, social, life, as, it, relied, upon, the, idea, of, social, actors, making, change, through, collective, struggles, his, relationship, with, the, media, was, improved, through, his, very, public, action, of, organizing, strikes, and, rallies, that, raised, huge, media, interest, in, him, and, his, many, books, became, more, popular, through, this, new, notoriety, one, of, the, main, differences, between, the, critical, sociologist, and, public, intellectual, is, the, ability, to, have, a, relationship, with, popular, media, resources, outside, the, academic, realm, it, is, notable, that, in, his, later, writings, bourdieu, sounded, cautionary, notes, about, such, individuals, describing, them, as, like, the, trojan, horse, for, the, unwanted, elements, they, may, bring, to, the, academic, world, again, bourdieu, seems, wary, of, accepting, the, description, public, intellectual, worrying, that, it, might, be, difficult, to, reconcile, with, science, and, scholarship, research, is, needed, on, what, conditions, transform, particular, intellectuals, into, public, intellectuals, bourdieu, developed, a, theory, of, the, action, around, the, concept, of, habitus, which, exerted, a, considerable, influence, in, the, social, sciences, this, theory, seeks, to, show, that, social, agents, develop, strategies, which, are, adapted, to, the, structures, of, the, social, worlds, that, they, inhabit, these, strategies, are, unconscious, and, act, on, the, level, of, a, bodily, logic, in, bourdieu, s, perspective, each, relatively, autonomous, field, of, modern, life, such, as, economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science, or, education, ultimately, engenders, a, specific, complex, of, social, relations, where, the, agents, will, engage, their, everyday, practice, through, this, practice, they, develop, a, certain, disposition, for, social, action, that, is, conditioned, by, their, position, on, the, field, this, disposition, combined, with, every, other, disposition, the, individual, develops, through, their, engagement, with, other, fields, operating, within, the, social, world, will, eventually, come, to, constitute, a, system, of, dispositions, i, e, habitus, lasting, acquired, schemes, of, perception, thought, and, action, habitus, is, somewhat, reminiscent, of, some, preexisting, sociological, concepts, such, as, socialization, though, it, also, differs, from, the, more, classic, concepts, in, several, key, ways, most, notably, a, central, aspect, of, the, habitus, is, its, embodiment, habitus, does, not, only, or, even, primarily, function, at, the, level, of, explicit, discursive, consciousness, the, internal, structures, become, embodied, and, work, in, a, deeper, practical, and, often, pre, reflexive, way, an, illustrative, example, might, be, the, muscle, memory, cultivated, in, many, areas, of, physical, education, consider, the, way, we, catch, a, ball, the, complex, geometric, trajectories, are, not, calculated, it, is, not, an, intellectual, process, although, it, is, a, skill, that, requires, learning, it, is, more, a, physical, than, a, mental, process, and, has, to, be, performed, physically, to, be, learned, in, this, sense, the, concept, has, something, in, common, with, anthony, giddens, concept, of, practical, consciousness, the, concept, of, habitus, was, inspired, by, marcel, mauss, s, notion, of, body, technique, and, hexis, as, well, as, erwin, panofsky, s, concept, of, intuitus, the, word, habitus, itself, can, be, found, in, the, works, of, mauss, as, well, as, of, norbert, elias, max, weber, edmund, husserl, and, alfred, schutz, as, re, workings, of, the, concept, as, it, emerged, in, aristotle, s, notion, of, hexis, which, would, become, habitus, through, thomas, aquinas, s, latin, translation, disposition, a, key, concept, in, bourdieu, s, work, can, be, defined, as, a, sense, of, the, game, a, partly, rational, but, partly, intuitive, understanding, of, fields, and, of, social, order, in, general, a, practical, sense, a, practical, reason, giving, rise, to, opinions, tastes, tone, of, voice, typical, body, movements, and, mannerisms, and, so, on, the, dispositions, constitutive, of, habitus, are, therefore, conditioned, responses, to, the, social, world, becoming, so, ingrained, that, they, come, to, occur, spontaneously, rather, like, knee, jerk, opinions, it, follows, that, the, habitus, developed, by, an, individual, will, typify, his, position, in, the, social, space, by, doing, so, social, agents, will, often, acknowledge, legitimate, and, reproduce, the, social, forms, of, domination, including, prejudices, and, the, common, opinions, of, each, field, as, self, evident, clouding, from, conscience, and, practice, even, the, acknowledgment, of, other, possible, means, of, production, including, symbolic, production, and, power, relations, though, not, deterministic, the, inculcation, of, the, subjective, structures, of, the, habitus, can, be, observed, through, statistical, data, for, example, while, its, selective, affinity, with, the, objective, structures, of, the, social, world, explains, the, continuity, of, the, social, order, through, time, as, the, individual, habitus, is, always, a, mix, of, multiple, engagements, in, the, social, world, through, the, person, s, life, while, the, social, fields, are, put, into, practice, through, the, agency, of, the, individuals, no, social, field, or, order, can, be, completely, stable, in, other, words, if, the, relation, between, individual, predisposition, and, social, structure, is, far, stronger, than, common, sense, tends, to, believe, it, is, not, a, perfect, match, some, examples, of, his, empirical, results, include, showing, that, despite, the, apparent, freedom, of, choice, in, the, arts, people, s, artistic, preferences, e, g, classical, music, rock, traditional, music, strongly, tie, in, with, their, social, position, and, showing, that, subtleties, of, language, such, as, accent, grammar, spelling, and, style, all, part, of, cultural, capital, are, a, major, factor, in, social, mobility, e, g, getting, a, higher, paid, higher, status, job, sociologists, very, often, look, at, either, social, laws, structure, or, the, individual, minds, agency, in, which, these, laws, are, inscribed, sociological, arguments, have, raged, between, those, who, argue, that, the, former, should, be, sociology, s, principal, interest, structuralists, and, those, who, argue, the, same, for, the, latter, phenomenologists, when, bourdieu, instead, asks, that, dispositions, be, considered, he, is, making, a, very, subtle, intervention, in, sociology, asserting, a, middle, ground, where, social, laws, and, individual, minds, meet, and, is, arguing, that, the, proper, object, of, sociological, analysis, should, be, this, middle, ground, dispositions, according, to, bourdieu, agents, do, not, continuously, calculate, according, to, explicit, rational, and, economic, criteria, rather, social, agents, operate, according, to, an, implicit, practical, logic, a, practical, sense, and, bodily, dispositions, instead, of, confining, his, analysis, of, social, relations, and, change, to, voluntaristic, agency, or, strictly, in, terms, of, class, as, a, structural, relation, bourdieu, uses, the, agency, structure, bridging, concept, of, field, a, field, can, be, described, as, any, historical, non, homogeneous, social, spatial, arena, in, which, people, maneuver, and, struggle, in, pursuit, of, desirable, resources, in, simpler, terms, a, field, refers, to, any, setting, in, which, agents, and, their, social, positions, are, located, accordingly, the, position, of, each, particular, agent, in, the, field, is, a, result, of, interaction, between, the, specific, rules, of, the, field, agent, s, habitus, and, agent, s, capital, social, economic, and, cultural, fields, interact, with, each, other, and, are, hierarchical, most, are, subordinate, to, the, larger, field, of, power, and, class, relations, for, bourdieu, social, activity, differences, led, to, various, relatively, autonomous, social, spaces, in, which, competition, centers, around, particular, capital, these, fields, are, treated, on, a, hierarchical, basis, with, economic, power, usually, governing, wherein, the, dynamics, of, fields, arise, out, of, the, struggle, of, social, actors, trying, to, occupy, the, dominant, positions, within, the, field, bourdieu, embraces, prime, elements, of, conflict, theory, like, marx, social, struggle, also, occurs, within, fields, hierarchically, nested, under, the, economic, antagonisms, between, social, classes, the, conflicts, which, take, place, in, each, social, field, have, specific, characteristics, arising, from, those, fields, and, that, involve, many, social, relationships, which, are, not, economic, social, agents, act, according, to, their, feel, for, the, game, in, which, the, feel, roughly, refers, to, the, habitus, and, the, game, to, the, field, bourdieu, s, most, significant, work, on, cultural, production, is, available, in, two, books, the, field, of, cultural, production, 1993, and, the, rules, of, art, 1996, bourdieu, builds, his, theory, of, cultural, production, using, his, own, characteristic, theoretical, vocabulary, of, habitus, capital, and, field, david, hesmondhalgh, writes, that, by, cultural, production, bourdieu, intends, a, very, broad, understanding, of, culture, in, line, with, the, tradition, of, classical, sociology, including, science, which, in, turn, includes, social, science, law, and, religion, as, well, as, expressive, aesthetic, activities, such, as, art, literature, and, music, however, his, work, on, cultural, production, focuses, overwhelmingly, on, two, types, of, field, or, sub, field, of, cultural, production, literature, and, art, according, to, bourdieu, the, principal, obstacle, to, a, rigorous, science, of, the, production, of, the, value, of, cultural, goods, is, the, charismatic, ideology, of, creation, which, can, be, easily, found, in, studies, of, art, literature, and, other, cultural, fields, in, bourdieu, s, opinion, this, charismatic, ideology, directs, the, gaze, towards, the, apparent, producer, and, prevents, us, from, asking, who, has, created, this, creator, and, the, magic, power, of, transubstantiation, with, which, the, creator, is, endowed, 167, for, bourdieu, a, sociologically, informed, view, of, an, artist, ought, to, describe, 1, their, relations, to, the, field, of, production, e, g, influences, antagonisms, etc, and, 2, their, attitudes, to, their, relations, to, the, field, of, consumption, e, g, their, readers, enthusiasts, or, detractors, further, a, work, of, literature, for, example, may, not, adequately, be, analysed, either, as, the, product, of, the, author, s, life, and, beliefs, a, naively, biographical, account, or, without, any, reference, to, the, author, s, intentions, as, barthes, argued, in, short, the, subject, of, a, work, is, a, habitus, in, relationship, with, a, post, a, position, that, is, within, a, field, according, to, bourdieu, cultural, revolutions, are, always, dependent, on, the, possibilities, present, in, the, positions, inscribed, in, the, field, for, bourdieu, habitus, was, essential, in, resolving, a, prominent, antinomy, of, the, human, sciences, objectivism, and, subjectivism, as, mentioned, above, bourdieu, used, the, methodological, and, theoretical, concepts, of, habitus, and, field, in, order, to, make, an, epistemological, break, with, the, prominent, objective, subjective, antinomy, of, the, social, sciences, he, wanted, to, effectively, unite, social, phenomenology, and, structuralism, habitus, and, field, are, proposed, to, do, so, the, individual, agent, develops, these, dispositions, in, response, to, the, objective, conditions, it, encounters, in, this, way, bourdieu, theorizes, the, inculcation, of, objective, social, structures, into, the, subjective, mental, experience, of, agents, for, the, objective, social, field, places, requirements, on, its, participants, for, membership, so, to, speak, within, the, field, having, thereby, absorbed, objective, social, structure, into, a, personal, set, of, cognitive, and, somatic, dispositions, and, the, subjective, structures, of, action, of, the, agent, then, being, commensurate, with, the, objective, structures, and, extant, exigencies, of, the, social, field, a, doxic, relationship, emerges, doxa, refers, to, the, learned, fundamental, deep, founded, unconscious, beliefs, and, values, taken, as, self, evident, universals, that, inform, an, agent, s, actions, and, thoughts, within, a, particular, field, doxa, tends, to, favor, the, particular, social, arrangement, of, the, field, thus, privileging, the, dominant, and, taking, their, position, of, dominance, as, self, evident, and, universally, favorable, therefore, the, categories, of, understanding, and, perception, that, constitute, a, habitus, being, congruous, with, the, objective, organization, of, the, field, tend, to, reproduce, the, very, structures, of, the, field, a, doxic, situation, may, be, thought, of, as, a, situation, characterized, by, a, harmony, between, the, objective, external, structures, and, the, subjective, internal, structures, of, the, habitus, in, the, doxic, state, the, social, world, is, perceived, as, natural, taken, for, granted, and, even, commonsensical, bourdieu, thus, sees, habitus, as, an, important, factor, contributing, to, social, reproduction, because, it, is, central, to, generating, and, regulating, the, practices, that, make, up, social, life, individuals, learn, to, want, what, conditions, make, possible, for, them, and, not, to, aspire, to, what, is, not, available, to, them, the, conditions, in, which, the, individual, lives, generate, dispositions, compatible, with, these, conditions, including, tastes, in, art, literature, food, and, music, and, in, a, sense, pre, adapted, to, their, demands, the, most, improbable, practices, are, therefore, excluded, as, unthinkable, by, a, kind, of, immediate, submission, to, order, that, inclines, agents, to, make, a, virtue, of, necessity, that, is, to, refuse, what, is, categorically, denied, and, to, will, the, inevitable, 54, amongst, any, society, of, individuals, the, constant, performance, of, dispositions, trivial, and, grand, forms, an, observable, range, of, preferences, and, allegiances, points, and, vectors, this, spatial, metaphor, can, be, analysed, by, sociologists, and, realised, in, diagrammatic, form, ultimately, conceptualising, social, relations, this, way, gives, rise, to, an, image, of, society, as, a, web, of, interrelated, spaces, these, are, the, social, fields, for, bourdieu, habitus, and, field, can, only, exist, in, relation, to, each, other, although, a, field, is, constituted, by, the, various, social, agents, participating, in, it, and, thus, their, habitus, a, habitus, in, effect, represents, the, transposition, of, objective, structures, of, the, field, into, the, subjective, structures, of, action, and, thought, of, the, agent, the, relationship, between, habitus, and, field, is, twofold, first, the, field, exists, only, insofar, as, social, agents, possess, the, dispositions, and, set, of, perceptual, schemata, that, are, necessary, to, constitute, that, field, and, imbue, it, with, meaning, concomitantly, by, participating, in, the, field, agents, incorporate, into, their, habitus, the, proper, know, how, that, will, allow, them, to, constitute, the, field, habitus, manifests, the, structures, of, the, field, and, the, field, mediates, between, habitus, and, practice, bourdieu, attempts, to, use, the, concepts, of, habitus, and, field, to, remove, the, division, between, the, subjective, and, the, objective, bourdieu, asserts, that, any, research, must, be, composed, of, two, minutes, wherein, the, first, minute, is, an, objective, stage, of, research, where, one, looks, at, the, relations, of, the, social, space, and, the, structures, of, the, field, while, the, second, minute, must, be, a, subjective, analysis, of, social, agents, dispositions, to, act, and, their, categories, of, perception, and, understanding, that, result, from, their, inhabiting, the, field, proper, research, bourdieu, argues, thus, cannot, do, without, these, two, together, bourdieu, contended, there, is, transcendental, objectivity, only, when, certain, necessary, historical, conditions, are, met, the, scientific, field, is, precisely, that, field, in, which, objectivity, may, be, acquired, bourdieu, s, ideal, scientific, field, is, one, that, grants, its, participants, an, interest, or, investment, in, objectivity, further, this, ideal, scientific, field, is, one, in, which, the, field, s, degree, of, autonomy, advances, and, in, a, corresponding, process, its, entrance, fee, becomes, increasingly, strict, the, scientific, field, entails, rigorous, intersubjective, scrutinizing, of, theory, and, data, this, should, make, it, difficult, for, those, within, the, field, to, bring, in, for, example, political, influence, however, the, autonomy, of, the, scientific, field, cannot, be, taken, for, granted, an, important, part, of, bourdieu, s, theory, is, that, the, historical, development, of, a, scientific, field, sufficiently, autonomous, to, be, described, as, such, and, to, produce, objective, work, is, an, achievement, that, requires, continual, reproduction, having, been, achieved, it, cannot, be, assumed, to, be, secure, bourdieu, does, not, discount, the, possibility, that, the, scientific, field, may, lose, its, autonomy, and, therefore, deteriorate, losing, its, defining, characteristic, as, a, producer, of, objective, work, in, this, way, the, conditions, of, possibility, for, the, production, of, transcendental, objectivity, could, arise, and, then, disappear, bourdieu, insists, on, the, importance, of, a, reflexive, sociology, in, which, sociologists, must, at, all, times, conduct, their, research, with, conscious, attention, to, the, effects, of, their, own, position, their, own, set, of, internalized, structures, and, how, these, are, likely, to, distort, or, prejudice, their, objectivity, the, sociologist, according, to, bourdieu, must, engage, in, a, sociology, of, sociology, so, as, not, to, unwittingly, attribute, to, the, object, of, observation, the, characteristics, of, the, subject, they, ought, to, conduct, their, research, with, one, eye, continually, reflecting, back, upon, their, own, habitus, their, dispositions, learned, through, long, social, and, institutional, training, it, is, only, by, maintaining, such, a, continual, vigilance, that, the, sociologists, can, spot, themselves, in, the, act, of, importing, their, own, biases, into, their, work, reflexivity, is, therefore, a, kind, of, additional, stage, in, the, scientific, epistemology, it, is, not, enough, for, the, scientist, to, go, through, the, usual, stages, research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer, review, etc, bourdieu, recommends, also, that, the, scientist, purge, their, work, of, the, prejudices, likely, to, derive, from, their, social, position, in, a, good, illustration, of, the, process, bourdieu, chastises, academics, including, himself, for, judging, their, students, work, against, a, rigidly, scholastic, linguistic, register, favouring, students, whose, writing, appears, polished, marking, down, those, guilty, of, vulgarity, without, a, reflexive, analysis, of, the, snobbery, being, deployed, under, the, cover, of, those, subjective, terms, the, academic, will, unconsciously, reproduce, a, degree, of, class, prejudice, promoting, the, student, with, high, linguistic, capital, and, holding, back, the, student, who, lacks, it, not, because, of, the, objective, quality, of, the, work, but, simply, because, of, the, register, in, which, it, is, written, reflexivity, should, enable, the, academic, to, be, conscious, of, their, prejudices, e, g, for, apparently, sophisticated, writing, and, impel, them, to, take, steps, to, correct, for, this, bias, bourdieu, also, describes, how, the, scholastic, point, of, view, unconsciously, alters, how, scientists, approach, their, objects, of, study, because, of, the, systematicity, of, their, training, and, their, mode, of, analysis, they, tend, to, exaggerate, the, systematicity, of, the, things, they, study, this, inclines, them, to, see, agents, following, clear, rules, where, in, fact, they, use, less, determinate, strategies, it, makes, it, hard, to, theorise, the, fuzzy, logic, of, the, social, world, its, practical, and, therefore, mutable, nature, poorly, described, by, words, like, system, structure, and, logic, which, imply, mechanisms, rigidity, and, omnipresence, the, scholar, can, too, easily, find, themselves, mistaking, the, things, of, logic, for, the, logic, of, things, a, phrase, of, marx, s, which, bourdieu, is, fond, of, quoting, again, reflexivity, is, recommended, as, the, key, to, discovering, and, correcting, for, such, errors, which, would, otherwise, remain, unseen, mistakes, produced, by, an, over, application, of, the, virtues, that, produced, also, the, truths, within, which, the, errors, are, embedded, 68, 70, bourdieu, introduced, the, notion, of, capital, defined, as, sums, of, particular, assets, put, to, productive, use, for, bourdieu, such, assets, could, take, various, forms, habitually, referring, to, several, principal, forms, of, capital, economic, symbolic, cultural, and, social, lo, c, wacquant, would, go, on, to, describe, bourdieu, s, thought, further, capital, comes, in, 3, principal, species, economic, cultural, and, social, a, fourth, species, symbolic, capital, designates, the, effects, of, any, form, of, capital, when, people, do, not, perceive, them, as, such, bourdieu, developed, theories, of, social, stratification, based, on, aesthetic, taste, in, his, 1979, work, distinction, a, social, critique, of, the, judgment, of, taste, in, french, la, distinction, published, by, harvard, university, press, bourdieu, claims, that, how, one, chooses, to, present, one, s, social, space, to, the, world, one, s, aesthetic, dispositions, depicts, one, s, status, and, distances, oneself, from, lower, groups, specifically, bourdieu, hypothesizes, that, children, internalize, these, dispositions, at, an, early, age, and, that, such, dispositions, guide, the, young, towards, their, appropriate, social, positions, towards, the, behaviors, that, are, suitable, for, them, and, foster, an, aversion, towards, other, behaviors, bourdieu, theorizes, that, class, fractions, teach, aesthetic, preferences, to, their, young, class, fractions, are, determined, by, a, combination, of, the, varying, degrees, of, social, economic, and, cultural, capital, society, incorporates, symbolic, goods, especially, those, regarded, as, the, attributes, of, excellence, the, ideal, weapon, in, strategies, of, distinction, 66, those, attributes, deemed, excellent, are, shaped, by, the, interests, of, the, dominating, class, he, emphasizes, the, dominance, of, cultural, capital, early, on, by, stating, that, differences, in, cultural, capital, mark, the, differences, between, the, classes, 69, the, development, of, aesthetic, dispositions, are, very, largely, determined, by, social, origin, rather, than, accumulated, capital, and, experience, over, time, the, acquisition, of, cultural, capital, depends, heavily, on, total, early, imperceptible, learning, performed, within, the, family, from, the, earliest, days, of, life, 66, bourdieu, argues, that, in, the, main, people, inherit, their, cultural, attitudes, the, accepted, definitions, that, their, elders, offer, them, 477, he, asserts, the, primacy, of, social, origin, and, cultural, capital, by, claiming, that, social, capital, and, economic, capital, though, acquired, cumulatively, over, time, depend, upon, it, bourdieu, claims, that, one, has, to, take, account, of, all, the, characteristics, of, social, condition, which, are, statistically, associated, from, earliest, childhood, with, possession, of, high, or, low, income, and, which, tend, to, shape, tastes, adjusted, to, these, conditions, 177, according, to, bourdieu, tastes, in, food, culture, and, presentation, are, indicators, of, class, because, trends, in, their, consumption, seemingly, correlate, with, an, individual, s, place, in, society, each, fraction, of, the, dominant, class, develops, its, own, aesthetic, criteria, the, multitude, of, consumer, interests, based, on, differing, social, positions, necessitates, that, each, fraction, has, its, own, artists, and, philosophers, newspapers, and, critics, just, as, it, has, its, hairdresser, interior, decorator, or, tailor, 231, 2, however, bourdieu, does, not, disregard, the, importance, of, social, capital, and, economic, capital, in, the, formation, of, cultural, capital, for, example, the, production, of, art, and, the, ability, to, play, an, instrument, presuppose, not, only, dispositions, associated, with, long, establishment, in, the, world, of, art, and, culture, but, also, economic, means, and, spare, time, 75, however, regardless, of, one, s, ability, to, act, upon, one, s, preferences, bourdieu, specifies, that, respondents, are, only, required, to, express, a, status, induced, familiarity, with, legitimate, culture, 63, functions, as, a, sort, of, social, orientation, a, sense, of, one, s, place, guiding, the, occupants, of, a, given, social, space, towards, the, social, positions, adjusted, to, their, properties, and, towards, the, practices, or, goods, which, befit, the, occupants, of, that, position, 466, thus, different, modes, of, acquisition, yield, differences, in, the, nature, of, preferences, 65, these, cognitive, structures, are, internalized, embodied, social, structures, becoming, a, natural, entity, to, the, individual, 468, different, tastes, are, thus, seen, as, unnatural, and, rejected, resulting, in, disgust, provoked, by, horror, or, visceral, intolerance, feeling, sick, of, the, tastes, of, others, 56, bourdieu, himself, believes, class, distinction, and, preferences, are, most, marked, in, the, ordinary, choices, of, everyday, existence, such, as, furniture, clothing, or, cooking, which, are, particularly, revealing, of, deep, rooted, and, long, standing, dispositions, because, lying, outside, the, scope, of, the, educational, system, they, have, to, be, confronted, as, it, were, by, naked, taste, 77, indeed, bourdieu, believes, that, the, strongest, and, most, indelible, mark, of, infant, learning, would, probably, be, in, the, tastes, of, food, 79, bourdieu, thinks, that, meals, served, on, special, occasions, are, an, interesting, indicator, of, the, mode, of, self, presentation, adopted, in, showing, off, a, life, style, in, which, furniture, also, plays, a, part, 79, the, idea, is, that, their, likes, and, dislikes, should, mirror, those, of, their, associated, class, fractions, children, from, the, lower, end, of, the, social, hierarchy, are, predicted, to, choose, heavy, fatty, fattening, foods, which, are, also, cheap, in, their, dinner, layouts, opting, for, plentiful, and, good, meals, as, opposed, to, foods, that, are, original, and, exotic, 177, 179, these, potential, outcomes, would, reinforce, bourdieu, s, ethic, of, sobriety, for, the, sake, of, slimness, which, is, most, recognized, at, the, highest, levels, of, the, social, hierarchy, that, contrasts, the, convivial, indulgence, characteristic, of, the, lower, classes, 179, demonstrations, of, the, tastes, of, luxury, or, freedom, and, the, tastes, of, necessity, reveal, a, distinction, among, the, social, classes, the, degree, to, which, social, origin, affects, these, preferences, surpasses, both, educational, and, economic, capital, demonstrably, at, equivalent, levels, of, educational, capital, social, origin, remains, an, influential, factor, in, determining, these, dispositions, 63, how, one, describes, one, s, social, environment, relates, closely, to, social, origin, because, the, instinctive, narrative, springs, from, early, stages, of, development, 78, also, across, the, divisions, of, labor, economic, constraints, tend, to, relax, without, any, fundamental, change, in, the, pattern, of, spending, 185, this, observation, reinforces, the, idea, that, social, origin, more, than, economic, capital, produces, aesthetic, preferences, because, regardless, of, economic, capability, consumption, patterns, remain, stable, bourdieu, sees, symbolic, capital, e, g, prestige, honor, attention, as, a, crucial, source, of, power, symbolic, capital, is, any, species, of, capital, that, is, in, lo, c, wacquant, s, terms, not, perceived, as, such, but, which, is, instead, perceived, through, socially, inculcated, classificatory, schemes, when, a, holder, of, symbolic, capital, uses, the, power, this, confers, against, an, agent, who, holds, less, and, seeks, thereby, to, alter, their, actions, they, exercise, symbolic, violence, research, published, in, organization, science, shows, that, symbolic, capital, can, be, divided, along, two, dimensions, reputability, and, respectability, and, can, be, transferred, by, association, symbolic, violence, is, fundamentally, the, imposition, of, categories, of, thought, and, perception, upon, dominated, social, agents, who, then, take, the, social, order, to, be, just, it, is, the, incorporation, of, unconscious, structures, that, tend, to, perpetuate, the, structures, of, action, of, the, dominant, the, dominated, then, take, their, position, to, be, right, symbolic, violence, is, in, some, senses, much, more, powerful, than, physical, violence, in, that, it, is, embedded, in, the, very, modes, of, action, and, structures, of, cognition, of, individuals, and, imposes, the, spectre, of, legitimacy, of, the, social, order, in, his, theoretical, writings, bourdieu, employs, some, terminology, used, in, economics, to, analyze, the, processes, of, social, and, cultural, reproduction, of, how, the, various, forms, of, capital, tend, to, transfer, from, one, generation, to, the, next, for, bourdieu, formal, education, represents, the, key, example, of, this, process, educational, success, according, to, bourdieu, entails, a, whole, range, of, cultural, behaviour, extending, to, ostensibly, non, academic, features, like, gait, dress, or, accent, privileged, children, have, learned, this, behaviour, as, have, their, teachers, children, of, unprivileged, backgrounds, have, not, the, children, of, privilege, therefore, fit, the, pattern, of, their, teachers, expectations, with, apparent, ease, they, are, docile, the, unprivileged, are, found, to, be, difficult, to, present, challenges, yet, both, behave, as, their, upbringing, dictates, bourdieu, regards, this, ease, or, natural, ability, distinction, as, in, fact, the, product, of, a, great, social, labour, largely, on, the, part, of, the, parents, it, equips, their, children, with, the, dispositions, of, manner, as, well, as, thought, which, ensure, they, are, able, to, succeed, within, the, educational, system, and, can, then, reproduce, their, parents, class, position, in, the, wider, social, system, cultural, capital, refers, to, assets, e, g, competencies, skills, qualifications, which, enable, holders, to, mobilise, cultural, authority, and, can, also, be, a, source, of, misrecognition, and, symbolic, violence, for, example, working, class, children, can, come, to, see, the, educational, success, of, their, middle, class, peers, as, always, legitimate, seeing, what, is, often, class, based, inequality, as, instead, the, result, of, hard, work, or, even, natural, ability, a, key, part, of, this, process, is, the, transformation, of, people, s, symbolic, or, economic, inheritance, e, g, accent, or, property, into, cultural, capital, e, g, university, qualifications, bourdieu, argues, that, cultural, capital, has, developed, in, opposition, to, economic, capital, moreover, the, conflict, between, those, who, mostly, hold, cultural, capital, and, those, who, mostly, hold, economic, capital, finds, expression, in, the, opposed, social, fields, of, art, and, business, the, field, of, art, and, related, cultural, fields, are, seen, to, have, striven, historically, for, autonomy, which, in, different, times, and, places, has, been, more, or, less, achieved, the, autonomous, field, of, art, is, summed, up, as, an, economic, world, turned, upside, down, 81, highlighting, the, opposition, between, economic, and, cultural, capital, for, bourdieu, social, capital, is, the, sum, of, the, resources, actual, or, virtual, that, accrue, to, an, individual, or, a, group, by, virtue, of, possessing, a, durable, network, of, more, or, less, institutionalized, relationships, of, mutual, acquaintance, and, recognition, 119, in, order, for, individuals, to, gain, such, capital, they, must, work, for, it, constantly, and, it, takes, time, according, to, bourdieu, for, some, families, cultural, capital, is, accumulated, over, a, period, of, generations, as, they, adopt, cultural, investment, strategies, and, pass, them, on, to, their, children, this, gives, children, an, opportunity, to, realize, their, potential, through, education, and, they, pass, on, those, same, values, to, their, children, over, time, individuals, in, such, families, gain, cultural, currency, which, gives, them, an, inherent, advantage, over, other, groups, of, people, which, is, why, there, is, such, variation, in, academic, achievement, in, children, of, different, social, classes, having, such, cultural, currency, enables, people, to, compensate, for, a, lack, of, financial, capital, by, giving, them, a, certain, level, of, respect, and, status, in, society, bourdieu, believes, that, cultural, capital, may, play, a, role, when, individuals, pursue, power, and, status, in, society, through, politics, or, other, means, social, and, cultural, capital, along, with, economic, capital, contribute, to, the, inequality, we, see, in, the, world, according, to, bourdieu, s, argument, bourdieu, takes, language, to, be, not, merely, a, method, of, communication, but, also, a, mechanism, of, power, the, language, one, uses, is, designated, by, one, s, relational, position, in, a, field, or, social, space, different, uses, of, language, tend, to, reiterate, the, respective, positions, of, each, participant, linguistic, interactions, are, manifestations, of, the, participants, respective, positions, in, social, space, and, categories, of, understanding, and, thus, tend, to, reproduce, the, objective, structures, of, the, social, field, this, determines, who, has, a, right, to, be, listened, to, to, interrupt, to, ask, questions, and, to, lecture, and, to, what, degree, the, representation, of, identity, in, forms, of, language, can, be, subdivided, into, language, dialect, and, accent, for, example, the, use, of, different, dialects, in, an, area, can, represent, a, varied, social, status, for, individuals, for, example, until, the, french, revolution, the, differences, in, dialect, directly, reflected, a, person, s, presumed, social, status, peasants, and, the, lower, classes, spoke, local, dialects, while, only, nobles, and, the, upper, classes, were, fluent, in, the, official, french, language, accents, can, reflect, an, area, s, inner, conflict, with, classifications, and, authority, within, a, population, because, language, characteristics, are, acknowledged, and, noticed, as, signifiers, of, power, they, become, mechanisms, of, power, bourdieu, discusses, language, in, his, earlier, work, on, education, with, sociologists, jean, claude, passeron, and, monique, de, saint, martin, this, book, rapport, p, dagogique, et, communication, 1965, was, translated, into, english, in, 1994, in, their, work, the, authors, argue, that, academic, language, is, a, dead, language, for, the, great, majority, of, french, people, and, is, no, one, s, mother, tongue, this, statement, is, widely, cited, by, scholars, working, on, second, language, acquisition, particularly, in, the, context, of, teaching, english, academic, writing, to, speakers, of, languages, other, than, english, bourdieu, was, for, many, the, leading, intellectual, of, present, day, france, a, thinker, in, the, same, rank, as, foucault, barthes, and, lacan, his, works, have, been, translated, into, two, dozen, languages, and, have, affected, the, whole, gamut, of, disciplines, in, the, social, sciences, and, the, humanities, they, have, also, been, used, in, pedagogy, several, works, of, his, are, considered, classics, not, only, in, sociology, but, also, in, anthropology, education, and, cultural, studies, distinction, a, social, critique, of, the, judgement, of, taste, la, distinction, was, named, as, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, ten, most, important, works, of, sociology, by, the, international, sociological, association, the, rules, of, art, has, significantly, affected, sociology, history, literature, and, aesthetics, in, france, bourdieu, was, seen, not, as, an, ivory, tower, academic, or, cloistered, don, but, as, a, passionate, activist, for, those, he, believed, to, be, subordinated, by, society, in, 2001, a, documentary, film, about, bourdieu, sociology, is, a, martial, art, became, an, unexpected, hit, in, paris, its, very, title, stressed, how, much, of, a, politically, engaged, intellectual, bourdieu, was, taking, on, the, mantle, of, mile, zola, and, jean, paul, sartre, in, french, public, life, and, slugging, it, out, with, politicians, because, he, thought, that, was, what, people, like, him, should, do, for, bourdieu, sociology, was, a, combative, effort, that, sought, to, expose, the, un, thought, structures, that, lie, beneath, the, physical, somatic, and, thought, practices, of, social, agents, he, saw, sociology, as, a, means, of, confronting, symbolic, violence, and, of, exposing, those, unseen, areas, in, which, one, could, be, free, bourdieu, s, work, continues, to, be, influential, his, work, is, widely, cited, and, many, sociologists, and, other, social, scientists, work, explicitly, in, a, bourdieusian, framework, one, example, is, lo, c, wacquant, who, persistently, applies, the, bourdieusian, theoretical, and, methodological, principles, to, subjects, such, as, boxing, employing, what, bourdieu, termed, participant, objectivation, objectivation, participante, or, what, wacquant, calls, carnal, sociology, in, addition, to, publishing, a, book, on, bourdieu, s, lasting, influence, novelist, douard, louis, uses, the, legacy, of, pierre, bourdieu, as, a, literary, device, bourdieu, also, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, popularisation, of, correspondence, analysis, and, particularly, multiple, correspondence, analysis, bourdieu, held, that, these, geometric, techniques, of, data, analysis, are, like, his, sociology, inherently, relational, i, use, correspondence, analysis, very, much, because, i, think, that, it, is, essentially, a, relational, procedure, whose, philosophy, fully, expresses, what, in, my, view, constitutes, social, reality, it, is, a, procedure, that, thinks, in, relations, as, i, try, to, do,
