alaric, i, l, r, k, gothic, alar, ks, ruler, of, all, c, 370, 411, ad, was, the, first, king, of, the, visigoths, from, 395, to, 410, he, rose, to, leadership, of, the, goths, who, came, to, occupy, moesia, territory, acquired, a, couple, of, decades, earlier, by, a, combined, force, of, goths, and, alans, after, the, battle, of, adrianople, alaric, began, his, career, under, the, gothic, soldier, gainas, and, later, joined, the, roman, army, once, an, ally, of, rome, under, the, roman, emperor, theodosius, alaric, helped, defeat, the, franks, and, other, allies, of, a, would, be, roman, usurper, despite, losing, many, thousands, of, his, men, he, received, little, recognition, from, rome, and, left, the, roman, army, disappointed, after, the, death, of, theodosius, and, the, disintegration, of, the, roman, armies, in, 395, he, is, described, as, king, of, the, visigoths, as, the, leader, of, the, only, effective, field, force, remaining, in, the, balkans, he, sought, roman, legitimacy, never, quite, achieving, a, position, acceptable, to, himself, or, to, the, roman, authorities, he, operated, mainly, against, the, successive, western, roman, regimes, and, marched, into, italy, where, he, died, he, is, responsible, for, the, sack, of, rome, in, 410, one, of, several, notable, events, in, the, western, roman, empire, s, eventual, decline, according, to, jordanes, a, 6th, century, roman, bureaucrat, of, gothic, origin, who, later, turned, his, hand, to, history, alaric, was, born, on, peuce, island, at, the, mouth, of, the, danube, delta, in, present, day, romania, and, belonged, to, the, noble, balti, dynasty, of, the, thervingian, goths, there, is, no, way, to, verify, this, claim, historian, douglas, boin, does, not, make, such, an, unequivocal, assessment, about, alaric, s, gothic, heritage, and, instead, claims, he, came, from, either, the, thervingi, or, the, greuthung, tribes, when, the, goths, suffered, setbacks, against, the, huns, they, made, a, mass, migration, across, the, danube, and, fought, a, war, with, rome, alaric, was, probably, a, child, during, this, period, who, grew, up, along, rome, s, periphery, alaric, s, upbringing, was, shaped, by, living, along, the, border, of, roman, territory, in, a, region, that, the, romans, viewed, as, a, veritable, backwater, some, four, centuries, before, the, roman, poet, ovid, regarded, the, area, along, the, danube, and, black, sea, where, alaric, was, reared, as, a, land, of, barbarians, among, the, most, remote, in, the, vast, world, alaric, s, childhood, in, the, balkans, where, the, goths, had, settled, by, way, of, an, agreement, with, theodosius, was, spent, in, the, company, of, veterans, who, had, fought, at, the, battle, of, adrianople, in, 378, during, which, they, had, annihilated, much, of, the, eastern, army, and, killed, emperor, valens, imperial, campaigns, against, the, visigoths, were, conducted, until, a, treaty, was, reached, in, 382, this, treaty, was, the, first, foedus, on, imperial, roman, soil, and, required, these, semi, autonomous, germanic, tribes, among, whom, alaric, was, raised, to, supply, troops, for, the, roman, army, in, exchange, for, peace, control, of, cultivatable, land, and, freedom, from, roman, direct, administrative, control, correspondingly, there, was, hardly, a, region, along, the, roman, frontier, during, alaric, s, day, without, gothic, slaves, and, servants, of, one, form, or, another, for, several, subsequent, decades, many, goths, like, alaric, were, called, up, into, regular, units, of, the, eastern, field, army, while, others, served, as, auxiliaries, in, campaigns, led, by, theodosius, against, the, western, usurpers, magnus, maximus, and, eugenius, a, new, phase, in, the, relationship, between, the, goths, and, the, empire, resulted, from, the, treaty, signed, in, 382, as, more, and, more, goths, attained, aristocratic, rank, from, their, service, in, the, imperial, army, alaric, began, his, military, career, under, the, gothic, soldier, gainas, and, later, joined, the, roman, army, he, first, appeared, as, leader, of, a, mixed, band, of, goths, and, allied, peoples, who, invaded, thrace, in, 391, but, were, stopped, by, the, half, vandal, roman, general, stilicho, while, the, roman, poet, claudian, belittled, alaric, as, a, little, known, menace, terrorizing, southern, thrace, during, this, time, alaric, s, abilities, and, forces, were, formidable, enough, to, prevent, the, roman, emperor, theodosius, from, crossing, the, hebrus, river, by, 392, alaric, had, entered, roman, military, service, which, coincided, with, a, reduction, of, hostilities, between, goths, and, romans, in, 394, he, led, a, gothic, force, that, helped, emperor, theodosius, defeat, the, frankish, usurper, arbogast, fighting, at, the, behest, of, eugenius, at, the, battle, of, frigidus, despite, sacrificing, around, 10, 000, of, his, men, who, had, been, victims, of, theodosius, callous, tactical, decision, to, overwhelm, the, enemies, front, lines, using, gothic, foederati, alaric, received, little, recognition, from, the, emperor, alaric, was, among, the, few, who, survived, the, protracted, and, bloody, affair, many, romans, considered, it, their, gain, and, a, victory, that, so, many, goths, had, died, during, the, battle, of, frigidus, river, alaric, biographer, douglas, boin, 2020, posited, that, seeing, ten, thousand, of, his, alaric, s, dead, kinsmen, likely, elicited, questions, about, what, kind, of, ruler, theodosius, actually, had, been, and, whether, remaining, in, direct, roman, service, was, best, for, men, like, him, refused, the, reward, he, expected, which, included, a, promotion, to, the, position, of, magister, militum, and, command, of, regular, roman, units, alaric, mutinied, and, began, to, march, against, constantinople, on, 17, january, 395, theodosius, died, of, an, illness, leaving, his, two, young, and, incapable, sons, arcadius, and, honorius, in, stilicho, s, guardianship, modern, writers, regard, alaric, as, king, of, the, visigoths, from, 395, according, to, historian, peter, heather, it, is, not, entirely, clear, in, the, sources, if, alaric, rose, to, prominence, at, the, time, the, goths, revolted, following, theodosius, s, death, or, if, he, had, already, risen, within, his, tribe, as, early, as, the, war, against, eugenius, whatever, the, circumstances, jordanes, recorded, that, the, new, king, persuaded, his, people, to, seek, a, kingdom, by, their, own, exertions, rather, than, serve, others, in, idleness, whether, or, not, alaric, was, a, member, of, an, ancient, germanic, royal, clan, as, claimed, by, jordanes, and, debated, by, historians, is, less, important, than, his, emergence, as, a, leader, the, first, of, his, kind, since, fritigern, theodosius, s, death, left, the, roman, field, armies, collapsing, and, the, empire, divided, again, between, his, two, sons, one, taking, the, eastern, and, the, other, the, western, portion, of, the, empire, stilicho, made, himself, master, of, the, west, and, attempted, to, establish, control, in, the, east, as, well, and, led, an, army, into, greece, alaric, rebelled, again, historian, roger, collins, points, out, that, while, the, rivalries, created, by, the, two, halves, of, the, empire, vying, for, power, worked, to, alaric, s, advantage, and, that, of, his, people, simply, being, called, to, authority, by, the, gothic, people, did, not, solve, the, practicalities, of, their, needs, for, survival, he, needed, roman, authority, in, order, to, be, supplied, by, roman, cities, alaric, took, his, gothic, army, on, what, stilicho, s, propagandist, claudian, described, as, a, pillaging, campaign, that, began, first, in, the, east, historian, thomas, burns, s, interpretation, is, that, alaric, and, his, men, were, recruited, by, rufinus, s, eastern, regime, in, constantinople, and, sent, to, thessaly, to, stave, off, stilicho, s, threat, no, battle, took, place, alaric, s, forces, made, their, way, down, to, athens, and, along, the, coast, where, he, sought, to, force, a, new, peace, upon, the, romans, in, 396, he, marched, through, thermopylae, and, sacked, athens, where, archaeological, evidence, shows, widespread, damage, to, the, city, stilicho, s, propagandist, claudian, accuses, his, troops, of, plundering, for, the, next, year, or, so, as, far, south, as, the, mountainous, peloponnese, peninsula, and, reports, that, only, stilicho, s, surprise, attack, with, his, western, field, army, having, sailed, from, italy, stemmed, the, plundering, as, he, pushed, alaric, s, forces, north, into, epirus, zosimus, adds, that, stilicho, s, troops, destroyed, and, pillaged, too, and, let, alaric, s, men, escape, with, their, plunder, stilicho, was, forced, to, send, some, of, his, eastern, forces, home, they, went, to, constantinople, under, the, command, of, one, gainas, a, goth, with, a, large, gothic, following, on, arrival, gainas, murdered, rufinus, and, was, appointed, magister, militum, for, thrace, by, eutropius, the, new, supreme, minister, and, the, only, eunuch, consul, of, rome, who, zosimus, claims, controlled, arcadius, as, if, he, were, a, sheep, a, poem, by, synesius, advises, arcadius, to, display, manliness, and, remove, a, skin, clad, savage, probably, referring, to, alaric, from, the, councils, of, power, and, his, barbarians, from, the, roman, army, we, do, not, know, if, arcadius, ever, became, aware, of, this, advice, but, it, had, no, recorded, effect, stilicho, obtained, a, few, more, troops, from, the, german, frontier, and, continued, to, campaign, indecisively, against, the, eastern, empire, again, he, was, opposed, by, alaric, and, his, men, during, the, next, year, 397, eutropius, personally, led, his, troops, to, victory, over, some, huns, who, were, marauding, in, asia, minor, with, his, position, thus, strengthened, he, declared, stilicho, a, public, enemy, and, he, established, alaric, as, magister, militum, per, illyricum, alaric, thus, acquired, entitlement, to, gold, and, grain, for, his, followers, and, negotiations, were, underway, for, a, more, permanent, settlement, stilicho, s, supporters, in, milan, were, outraged, at, this, seeming, betrayal, meanwhile, eutropius, was, celebrated, in, 398, by, a, parade, through, constantinople, for, having, achieved, victory, over, the, wolves, of, the, north, alaric, s, people, were, relatively, quiet, for, the, next, couple, of, years, in, 399, eutropius, fell, from, power, the, new, eastern, regime, now, felt, that, they, could, dispense, with, alaric, s, services, and, they, nominally, transferred, alaric, s, province, to, the, west, this, administrative, change, removed, alaric, s, roman, rank, and, his, entitlement, to, legal, provisioning, for, his, men, leaving, his, army, the, only, significant, force, in, the, ravaged, balkans, as, a, problem, for, stilicho, according, to, historian, michael, kulikowski, sometime, in, the, spring, of, 402, alaric, decided, to, invade, italy, but, no, sources, from, antiquity, indicate, to, what, purpose, burns, suggests, that, alaric, was, probably, desperate, for, provisions, using, claudian, as, his, source, historian, guy, halsall, reports, that, alaric, s, attack, actually, began, in, late, 401, but, since, stilicho, was, in, raetia, dealing, with, frontier, issues, the, two, did, not, first, confront, one, another, in, italy, until, 402, alaric, s, entry, into, italy, followed, the, route, identified, in, the, poetry, of, claudian, as, he, crossed, the, peninsula, s, alpine, frontier, near, the, city, of, aquileia, for, a, period, of, six, to, nine, months, there, were, reports, of, gothic, attacks, along, the, northern, italian, roads, where, alaric, was, spotted, by, roman, townspeople, along, the, route, on, via, postumia, alaric, first, encountered, stilicho, two, battles, were, fought, the, first, was, at, pollentia, on, easter, sunday, where, stilicho, according, to, claudian, achieved, an, impressive, victory, taking, alaric, s, wife, and, children, prisoner, and, more, significantly, seizing, much, of, the, treasure, that, alaric, had, amassed, over, the, previous, five, years, worth, of, plundering, pursuing, the, retreating, forces, of, alaric, stilicho, offered, to, return, the, prisoners, but, was, refused, the, second, battle, was, at, verona, where, alaric, was, defeated, for, a, second, time, stilicho, once, again, offered, alaric, a, truce, and, allowed, him, to, withdraw, from, italy, kulikowski, explains, this, confusing, if, not, outright, conciliatory, behavior, by, stating, given, stilicho, s, cold, war, with, constantinople, it, would, have, been, foolish, to, destroy, as, biddable, and, violent, a, potential, weapon, as, alaric, might, well, prove, to, be, halsall, s, observations, are, similar, as, he, contends, that, the, roman, general, s, decision, to, permit, alaric, s, withdrawal, into, pannonia, makes, sense, if, we, see, alaric, s, force, entering, stilicho, s, service, and, stilicho, s, victory, being, less, total, than, claudian, would, have, us, believe, perhaps, more, revealing, is, a, report, from, the, greek, historian, zosimus, writing, a, half, a, century, later, that, indicates, an, agreement, was, concluded, between, stilicho, and, alaric, in, 405, which, suggests, alaric, being, in, western, service, at, that, point, likely, stemming, from, arrangements, made, back, in, 402, between, 404, and, 405, alaric, remained, in, one, of, the, four, pannonian, provinces, from, where, he, could, play, east, off, against, west, while, potentially, threatening, both, historian, a, d, lee, observes, alaric, s, return, to, the, north, west, balkans, brought, only, temporary, respite, to, italy, for, in, 405, another, substantial, body, of, goths, and, other, barbarians, this, time, from, outside, the, empire, crossed, the, middle, danube, and, advanced, into, northern, italy, where, they, plundered, the, countryside, and, besieged, cities, and, towns, under, their, leader, radagaisus, although, the, imperial, government, was, struggling, to, muster, enough, troops, to, contain, these, barbarian, invasions, stilicho, managed, to, stifle, the, threat, posed, by, the, tribes, under, radagaisus, when, the, latter, split, his, forces, into, three, separate, groups, stilicho, cornered, radagaisus, near, florence, and, starved, the, invaders, into, submission, meanwhile, alaric, bestowed, with, codicils, of, magister, militum, by, stilicho, and, now, supplied, by, the, west, awaited, for, one, side, or, the, other, to, incite, him, to, action, as, stilicho, faced, further, difficulties, from, more, barbarians, sometime, in, 406, and, into, 407, more, large, groups, of, barbarians, consisting, primarily, of, vandals, sueves, and, alans, crossed, the, rhine, into, gaul, while, about, the, same, time, a, rebellion, occurred, in, britain, under, a, common, soldier, named, constantine, it, spread, to, gaul, burdened, by, so, many, enemies, stilicho, s, position, was, strained, during, this, crisis, in, 407, alaric, again, marched, on, italy, taking, a, position, in, noricum, modern, austria, where, he, demanded, a, sum, of, 4, 000, pounds, of, gold, to, buy, off, another, full, scale, invasion, the, roman, senate, loathed, the, idea, of, supporting, alaric, zosimus, observed, that, one, senator, famously, declaimed, non, est, ista, pax, sed, pactio, servitutis, this, is, not, peace, but, a, pact, of, servitude, stilicho, paid, alaric, the, 4, 000, pounds, of, gold, nevertheless, this, agreement, sensible, in, view, of, the, military, situation, fatally, weakened, stilicho, s, standing, at, honorius, s, court, twice, stilicho, had, allowed, alaric, to, escape, his, grasp, and, radagaisus, had, advanced, all, the, way, to, the, outskirts, of, florence, in, the, east, arcadius, died, on, 1, may, 408, and, was, replaced, by, his, son, theodosius, ii, stilicho, seems, to, have, planned, to, march, to, constantinople, and, to, install, there, a, regime, loyal, to, himself, he, may, also, have, intended, to, give, alaric, a, senior, official, position, and, send, him, against, the, rebels, in, gaul, before, stilicho, could, do, so, while, he, was, away, at, ticinum, at, the, head, of, a, small, detachment, a, bloody, coup, against, his, supporters, took, place, at, honorius, s, court, it, was, led, by, honorius, s, minister, olympius, stilicho, s, small, escort, of, goths, and, huns, was, commanded, by, a, goth, sarus, whose, gothic, troops, massacred, the, hun, contingent, in, their, sleep, and, then, withdrew, towards, the, cities, in, which, their, own, families, were, billeted, stilicho, ordered, that, sarus, s, goths, should, not, be, admitted, but, now, without, an, army, he, was, forced, to, flee, for, sanctuary, agents, of, olympius, promised, stilicho, his, life, but, instead, betrayed, and, killed, him, alaric, was, again, declared, an, enemy, of, the, emperor, olympius, s, men, then, massacred, the, families, of, the, federate, troops, as, presumed, supporters, of, stilicho, although, they, had, probably, rebelled, against, him, and, the, troops, defected, en, masse, to, alaric, many, thousands, of, barbarian, auxiliaries, along, with, their, wives, and, children, joined, alaric, in, noricum, the, conspirators, seem, to, have, let, their, main, army, disintegrate, and, had, no, policy, except, hunting, down, supporters, of, stilicho, italy, was, left, without, effective, indigenous, defence, forces, thereafter, as, a, declared, enemy, of, the, emperor, alaric, was, denied, the, legitimacy, that, he, needed, to, collect, taxes, and, hold, cities, without, large, garrisons, which, he, could, not, afford, to, detach, he, again, offered, to, move, his, men, this, time, to, pannonia, in, exchange, for, a, modest, sum, of, money, and, the, modest, title, of, comes, but, he, was, refused, because, olympius, s, regime, regarded, him, as, a, supporter, of, stilicho, when, alaric, was, rebuffed, he, led, his, force, of, around, 30, 000, men, many, newly, enlisted, and, understandably, motivated, on, a, march, toward, rome, to, avenge, their, murdered, families, he, moved, across, the, julian, alps, into, italy, probably, using, the, route, and, supplies, arranged, for, him, by, stilicho, bypassing, the, imperial, court, in, ravenna, which, was, protected, by, widespread, marshland, and, had, a, port, and, in, september, 408, he, menaced, the, city, of, rome, imposing, a, strict, blockade, no, blood, was, shed, this, time, alaric, relied, on, hunger, as, his, most, powerful, weapon, when, the, ambassadors, of, the, senate, entreating, for, peace, tried, to, intimidate, him, with, hints, of, what, the, despairing, citizens, might, accomplish, he, laughed, and, gave, his, celebrated, answer, the, thicker, the, hay, the, easier, mowed, after, much, bargaining, the, famine, stricken, citizens, agreed, to, pay, a, ransom, of, 5, 000, pounds, of, gold, 30, 000, pounds, of, silver, 4, 000, silken, tunics, 3, 000, hides, dyed, scarlet, and, 3, 000, pounds, of, pepper, alaric, also, recruited, some, 40, 000, freed, gothic, slaves, thus, ended, alaric, s, first, siege, of, rome, after, having, provisionally, agreed, to, the, terms, offered, by, alaric, for, lifting, the, blockade, honorius, recanted, historian, a, d, lee, highlights, that, one, of, the, points, of, contention, for, the, emperor, was, alaric, s, expectation, of, being, named, head, of, the, roman, army, a, post, honorius, was, not, prepared, to, grant, to, alaric, when, this, title, was, not, bestowed, onto, alaric, he, proceeded, to, not, only, besiege, rome, again, in, late, 409, but, also, to, proclaim, a, leading, senator, priscus, attalus, as, a, rival, emperor, from, whom, alaric, then, received, the, appointment, he, desired, meanwhile, alaric, s, newly, appointed, emperor, attalus, who, seems, not, to, have, understood, the, limits, of, his, power, or, his, dependence, on, alaric, failed, to, take, alaric, s, advice, and, lost, the, grain, supply, in, africa, to, a, pro, honorian, comes, africae, heraclian, then, sometime, in, 409, attalus, accompanied, by, alaric, marched, on, ravenna, and, after, receiving, unprecedented, terms, and, concessions, from, the, legitimate, emperor, honorius, refused, him, and, instead, demanded, that, honorius, be, deposed, and, exiled, fearing, for, his, safety, honorius, made, preparations, to, flee, to, ravenna, when, ships, carrying, 4, 000, troops, arrived, from, constantinople, restoring, his, resolve, now, that, honorius, no, longer, felt, the, need, to, negotiate, alaric, regretting, his, choice, of, puppet, emperor, deposed, attalus, perhaps, to, re, open, negotiations, with, ravenna, negotiations, with, honorius, might, have, succeeded, had, it, not, been, for, another, intervention, by, sarus, of, the, amal, family, and, therefore, a, hereditary, enemy, of, alaric, and, his, house, he, attacked, alaric, s, men, why, sarus, who, had, been, in, imperial, service, for, years, under, stilicho, acted, at, this, moment, remains, a, mystery, but, alaric, interpreted, this, attack, as, directed, by, ravenna, and, as, bad, faith, from, honorius, no, longer, would, negotiations, suffice, for, alaric, as, his, patience, had, reached, its, end, which, led, him, to, march, on, rome, for, a, third, and, final, time, on, 24, august, 410, alaric, and, his, forces, began, the, sack, of, rome, an, assault, that, lasted, three, days, after, hearing, reports, that, alaric, had, entered, the, city, possibly, aided, by, gothic, slaves, inside, there, were, reports, that, emperor, honorius, safe, in, ravenna, broke, into, wailing, and, lamentation, but, quickly, calmed, once, it, was, explained, to, him, that, it, was, the, city, of, rome, that, had, met, its, end, and, not, roma, his, pet, fowl, writing, from, bethlehem, st, jerome, letter, 127, 12, to, the, lady, principia, lamented, a, dreadful, rumour, reached, us, from, the, west, we, heard, that, rome, was, besieged, that, the, citizens, were, buying, their, safety, with, gold, the, city, which, had, taken, the, whole, world, was, itself, taken, nay, it, fell, by, famine, before, it, fell, to, the, sword, nonetheless, christian, apologists, also, cited, how, alaric, ordered, that, anyone, who, took, shelter, in, a, church, was, to, be, spared, when, liturgical, vessels, were, taken, from, the, basilica, of, st, peter, and, alaric, heard, of, this, he, ordered, them, returned, and, had, them, ceremoniously, restored, in, the, church, if, the, account, from, the, historian, orosius, can, be, seen, as, accurate, there, was, even, a, celebratory, recognition, of, christian, unity, by, way, of, a, procession, through, the, streets, where, romans, and, barbarians, alike, raised, a, hymn, to, god, in, public, historian, edward, james, concludes, that, such, stories, are, likely, more, political, rhetoric, of, the, noble, barbarians, than, a, reflection, of, historical, reality, according, to, historian, patrick, geary, roman, booty, was, not, the, focus, of, alaric, s, sack, of, rome, he, came, for, needed, food, supplies, historian, stephen, mitchell, asserts, that, alaric, s, followers, seemed, incapable, of, feeding, themselves, and, relied, on, provisions, supplied, by, the, roman, authorities, whatever, alaric, s, intentions, were, cannot, be, known, entirely, but, kulikowski, certainly, sees, the, issue, of, available, treasure, in, a, different, light, writing, that, for, three, days, alaric, s, goths, sacked, the, city, stripping, it, of, the, wealth, of, centuries, the, barbarian, invaders, were, not, gentle, in, their, treatment, of, property, as, substantial, damage, was, still, evident, into, the, sixth, century, certainly, the, roman, world, was, shaken, by, the, fall, of, the, eternal, city, to, barbarian, invaders, but, as, guy, halsall, emphasizes, rome, s, fall, had, less, striking, political, effects, alaric, unable, to, treat, with, honorius, remained, in, the, political, cold, kulikowski, sees, the, situation, similarly, commenting, but, for, alaric, the, sack, of, rome, was, an, admission, of, defeat, a, catastrophic, failure, everything, he, had, hoped, for, had, fought, for, over, the, course, of, a, decade, and, a, half, went, up, in, flames, with, the, capital, of, the, ancient, world, imperial, office, a, legitimate, place, for, himself, and, his, followers, inside, the, empire, these, were, now, forever, out, of, reach, he, might, seize, what, he, wanted, as, he, had, seized, rome, but, he, would, never, be, given, it, by, right, the, sack, of, rome, solved, nothing, and, when, the, looting, was, over, alaric, s, men, still, had, nowhere, to, live, and, fewer, future, prospects, than, ever, before, still, the, importance, of, alaric, cannot, be, overestimated, according, to, halsall, since, he, had, desired, and, obtained, a, roman, command, even, though, he, was, a, barbarian, his, real, misfortune, was, being, caught, between, the, rivalry, of, the, eastern, and, western, empires, and, their, court, intrigue, according, to, historian, peter, brown, when, one, compares, alaric, with, other, barbarians, he, was, almost, an, elder, statesman, nonetheless, alaric, s, respect, for, roman, institutions, as, a, former, servant, to, its, highest, office, did, not, stay, his, hand, in, violently, sacking, the, city, that, had, for, centuries, exemplified, roman, glory, leaving, behind, physical, destruction, and, social, disruption, while, alaric, took, clerics, and, even, the, emperor, s, sister, galla, placidia, with, him, when, he, left, the, city, many, other, italian, communities, beyond, the, city, of, rome, itself, fell, victim, to, the, forces, under, alaric, as, procopius, wars, 3, 2, 11, 13, writing, in, the, sixth, century, later, relates, for, they, destroyed, all, the, cities, which, they, captured, especially, those, south, of, the, ionian, gulf, so, completely, that, nothing, has, been, left, to, my, time, to, know, them, by, unless, indeed, it, might, be, one, tower, or, gate, or, some, such, thing, which, chanced, to, remain, and, they, killed, all, the, people, as, many, as, came, in, their, way, both, old, and, young, alike, sparing, neither, women, nor, children, wherefore, even, up, to, the, present, time, italy, is, sparsely, populated, whether, alaric, s, forces, wrought, the, level, of, destruction, described, by, procopius, or, not, cannot, be, known, but, evidence, speaks, to, a, significant, population, decrease, as, the, number, of, people, on, the, food, dole, dropped, from, 800, 000, in, 408, to, 500, 000, by, 419, rome, s, fall, to, the, barbarians, was, as, much, a, psychological, blow, to, the, empire, as, anything, else, since, some, romans, citizens, saw, the, collapse, as, resulting, from, the, conversion, to, christianity, while, christian, apologists, like, augustine, writing, city, of, god, responded, in, turn, lamenting, rome, s, capture, famed, christian, theologian, jerome, wrote, how, day, and, night, he, could, not, stop, thinking, of, everyone, s, safety, and, moreover, how, alaric, had, extinguished, the, bright, light, of, all, the, world, some, contemporary, christian, observers, even, saw, alaric, a, professed, christian, as, god, s, wrath, upon, a, still, pagan, rome, not, only, had, rome, s, sack, been, a, significant, blow, to, the, roman, people, s, morale, they, had, also, endured, two, years, worth, of, trauma, brought, about, by, fear, hunger, due, to, blockades, and, illness, however, the, goths, were, not, long, in, the, city, of, rome, as, only, three, days, after, the, sack, alaric, marched, his, men, south, to, campania, from, where, he, intended, to, sail, to, sicily, probably, to, obtain, grain, and, other, supplies, when, a, storm, destroyed, his, fleet, during, the, early, months, of, 411, while, on, his, northward, return, journey, through, italy, alaric, took, ill, and, died, at, consentia, in, bruttium, his, cause, of, death, was, likely, fever, and, his, body, was, according, to, legend, buried, under, the, riverbed, of, the, busento, in, accordance, with, the, pagan, practices, of, the, visigothic, people, the, stream, was, temporarily, turned, aside, from, its, course, while, the, grave, was, dug, wherein, the, gothic, chief, and, some, of, his, most, precious, spoils, were, interred, when, the, work, was, finished, the, river, was, turned, back, into, its, usual, channel, and, the, captives, by, whose, hands, the, labor, had, been, accomplished, were, put, to, death, that, none, might, learn, their, secret, alaric, was, succeeded, in, the, command, of, the, gothic, army, by, his, brother, in, law, ataulf, who, married, honorius, sister, galla, placidia, three, years, later, following, in, the, wake, of, alaric, s, leadership, which, kulikowski, claims, had, given, his, people, a, sense, of, community, that, survived, his, own, death, alaric, s, goths, remained, together, inside, the, empire, going, on, to, settle, in, gaul, there, in, the, province, of, aquitaine, they, put, down, roots, and, created, the, first, autonomous, barbarian, kingdom, inside, the, frontiers, of, the, roman, empire, the, goths, were, able, to, settle, in, aquitaine, only, after, honorius, granted, the, once, roman, province, to, them, sometime, in, 418, or, 419, not, long, after, alaric, s, exploits, in, rome, and, athaulf, s, settlement, in, aquitaine, there, is, a, rapid, emergence, of, germanic, barbarian, groups, in, the, west, who, begin, controlling, many, western, provinces, these, barbarian, peoples, included, vandals, in, spain, and, africa, visigoths, in, spain, and, aquitaine, burgundians, along, the, upper, rhine, and, southern, gaul, and, franks, on, the, lower, rhine, and, in, northern, and, central, gaul, the, chief, authorities, on, the, career, of, alaric, are, the, historian, orosius, and, the, poet, claudian, both, contemporary, neither, disinterested, zosimus, a, historian, who, lived, probably, about, half, a, century, after, alaric, s, death, and, jordanes, a, goth, who, wrote, the, history, of, his, nation, in, 551, basing, his, work, on, cassiodorus, s, gothic, history
