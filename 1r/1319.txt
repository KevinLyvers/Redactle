rule, is, often, placed, as, the, beginning, of, modern, ethiopia, and, brought, an, end, to, the, decentralized, zemene, mesafint, era, of, the, princes, although, tewodros, ii, s, origins, were, in, the, era, of, the, princes, his, ambitions, were, not, those, of, the, regional, nobility, he, sought, to, re, establish, a, cohesive, ethiopian, state, and, to, reform, its, administration, and, church, tewodros, ii, s, first, task, after, having, reunited, the, other, provinces, was, to, bring, shewa, under, his, control, during, the, era, of, the, princes, shewa, was, even, more, than, most, provinces, an, independent, entity, its, ruler, even, styling, himself, negus, the, title, for, king, in, the, course, of, subduing, the, shewans, tewodros, took, with, him, a, shewan, prince,

rebellions, by, nobles, in, other, regions, resisting, modernization, he, ultimately, committed, suicide, at, the, battle, of, magdala, during, the, british, expedition, to, abyssinia, in, the, first, six, years, of, his, reign, the, new, ruler, managed, to, put, down, these, rebellions, and, the, empire, was, relatively, peaceful, from, about, 1861, to, 1863, but, the, energy, wealth, and, manpower, necessary, to, deal, with, regional, opposition, limited, the, scope, of, tewodros, s, other, activities, tewodros, ii, never, realized, his, dream, of, restoring, a, strong, monarchy, although, he, took, many, important, initial, steps, he, sought, to, establish, the, principle, that, governors, and, judges, must, be, salaried, appointees, he, also, established, a, professional, standing, army, rather, than, depending, on, local, lords, to, provide, soldiers, for, his, expeditions, he, introduced, the, collection, of, books, in, the, form, of, a, library, tax, codes, as, well, as, a, centralized, political, system, with, respective, administrative, districts, he, also, intended, to, reform, the, church, but, he, was, confronted, by, strong, opposition, when, he, tried, to, impose, a, tax, on, church, lands, to, help, finance, government, activities, tewodros, confiscation, of, these, lands, gained, him, enemies, in, the, church, and, little, support, elsewhere, essentially, tewodros, was, a, talented, military, campaigner, the, british, consul, walter, plowden, knew, well, the, political, events, of, ethiopia, during, the, 1850s, and, had, foretold, the, rising, star, of, kassa, the, freelance, warrior, from, qwara, when, being, crowned, as, king, plowden, described, him, as, such, the, king, theodorus, is, young, in, years, vigorous, in, all, manly, exercises, of, a, striking, countenance, peculiarly, polite, and, engaging, when, pleased, and, mostly, displaying, great, tact, and, delicacy, he, is, persuaded, that, he, is, destined, to, restore, the, glories, of, the, ethiopian, empire, and, to, achieve, great, conquests, of, untiring, energy, both, mental, and, bodily, his, personal, and, moral, daring, is, boundless, when, aroused, his, wrath, is, terrible, and, all, tremble, but, at, all, moments, he, possesses, a, perfect, self, control, indefatigable, in, business, he, takes, little, repose, night, or, day, his, ideas, and, language, are, clear, and, precise, hesitation, is, not, known, to, him, and, has, no, counsellors, or, go, between, he, is, fond, of, splendour, and, received, in, state, even, on, a, campaign, he, is, unsparing, in, punishment, necessary, in, a, wilderness, as, abyssinia, at, that, time, he, salutes, his, meanest, poor, subjects, with, courtesy, is, sincerely, though, often, mistakenly, religious, and, will, acknowledge, a, fault, committed, to, his, poorest, follower, in, a, moment, of, compassion, with, sincerity, and, grace, he, is, generous, to, excess, and, free, from, all, cupidity, regarding, nothing, with, pleasure, or, desire, but, munitions, of, war, for, his, soldiers, he, has, exercised, the, utmost, clemency, towards, the, vanquished, treating, them, more, like, friends, than, enemies, his, faith, is, signal, without, christ, i, am, nothing, the, french, explorer, geographer, ethnologist, linguist, and, astronomer, antoine, thomson, d, abbadie, describes, him, during, his, stay, in, ethiopia, kassa, passed, for, being, twenty, eight, his, face, was, more, black, than, red, like, almost, all, ethiopians, he, had, a, slender, body, and, seemed, to, owe, his, great, agility, less, to, his, muscles, than, to, his, powerful, will, his, forehead, is, high, and, almost, domed, his, slightly, aquiline, nose, is, a, common, trait, among, thoroughbred, amharas, his, beard, is, very, light, and, his, lip, thin, georg, wilhelm, schimper, the, german, botanist, had, mentioned, the, following, about, tewodros, theodore, the, new, king, of, kings, of, ethiopia, was, certainly, the, most, remarkable, man, that, has, appeared, in, africa, for, some, centuries, at, the, date, of, his, assumption, of, the, regal, title, theodore, was, thirty, seven, years, of, age, of, medium, stature, but, possessing, a, well, knit, muscular, frame, capable, of, ensuring, any, amount, of, fatigue, a, noble, bearing, and, a, majestic, walk, and, he, was, the, best, shot, the, best, spearmen, the, best, runner, and, the, best, horseman, in, abyssinia, kassa, hailu, was, born, in, qwara, west, of, gondar, his, father, was, an, amhara, nobleman, of, the, qwara, district, named, hailegiorgis, woldegiorgis, his, paternal, grandfather, dejazmatch, woldegiorgis, was, a, widely, respected, figure, of, his, time, dembiya, was, part, of, the, large, territory, known, as, ye, maru, qemas, which, translates, as, the, taste, of, the, honey, or, literally, what, has, been, tasted, by, maru, his, paternal, grandfather, dejazmatch, woldegiorgis, was, a, widely, respected, figure, of, his, time, dembiya, was, part, of, the, large, territory, known, as, ye, maru, qemas, which, translates, as, the, taste, of, the, honey, or, literally, what, has, been, tasted, by, maru, this, name, was, given, to, the, territory, because, it, was, the, personal, fief, of, dejazmach, maru, a, powerful, warlord, and, relative, of, kassa, when, maru, died, in, october, 1827, his, fiefdom, was, given, albeit, begrudgingly, to, dejazmach, hailu, by, the, governor, of, the, province, empress, menen, liben, amede, kassa, was, in, line, to, potentially, take, control, of, ye, maru, qemas, after, kenfu, s, death, though, kenfu, also, wanted, to, give, the, land, to, his, own, sons, when, kenfu, died, however, neither, his, sons, nor, kassa, inherited, control, of, the, territory, because, empress, menen, liben, re, annexed, it, under, her, own, control, according, to, the, ethiopian, chronicles, kassa, s, mother, woizero, atitegeb, wondbewossen, was, from, gondar, and, belonged, to, a, noble, family, however, according, to, hormuzd, rassam, she, was, originally, from, amhara, sayint, her, mother, woizero, tishal, was, a, member, of, a, noble, family, of, begemder, while, her, paternal, grandfather, ras, wodajo, was, a, powerful, and, highly, influential, figure, it, is, thought, that, tewodros, ii, s, paternal, side, of, the, family, carried, with, it, a, slim, margin, of, solomonic, pedigree, however, insignificant, it, proved, when, compared, to, the, more, prominently, illustrious, ancestries, of, some, of, his, highborn, rivals, tewodros, in, his, reign, indeed, claimed, that, his, father, was, descended, from, emperor, fasilides, by, way, of, a, daughter, when, kassa, was, very, young, his, parents, divorced, and, woizero, atitegeb, moved, back, to, gondar, taking, her, son, with, her, not, long, after, their, departure, however, news, reached, them, that, kassa, s, father, had, died, popular, legend, states, that, kassa, s, paternal, relatives, split, up, the, entire, paternal, inheritance, leaving, young, kassa, and, his, mother, with, nothing, and, in, very, dire, circumstances, financially, in, hard, times, his, enemies, came, up, with, a, rumour, that, she, was, reduced, to, selling, kosso, a, claim, for, which, kassa, would, go, on, to, imprison, henry, aaron, stern, for, publishing, during, his, reign, there, is, actually, no, evidence, that, woizero, atitegeb, was, ever, a, kosso, seller, and, several, writers, such, as, paulos, ngo, ngo, have, stated, outright, that, it, was, a, false, rumor, spread, by, her, detractors, evidence, indicates, that, woizero, atitegeb, was, fairly, well, to, do, and, indeed, had, inherited, considerable, land, holdings, from, her, own, illustrious, relatives, from, which, to, lead, a, comfortable, life, kassa, s, youth, was, probably, not, lived, lavishly, but, he, was, far, from, a, pauper, kassa, was, sent, to, school, at, the, convent, of, tekla, haymanot, between, gondar, and, lake, tana, he, took, refuge, when, it, was, sacked, by, a, defeated, dejazmatch, wube, who, by, burning, and, dismembering, the, children, took, vengeance, on, their, victorious, parents, kassa, escaped, and, fled, to, the, protection, of, his, kinsman, dejazmach, kenfu, hailu, probably, his, uncle, but, believed, to, be, his, half, brother, he, continued, his, formal, education, and, became, familiar, with, the, bible, and, ethiopian, literature, he, also, received, instruction, on, the, techniques, of, ethiopian, warfare, from, kenfu, when, kenfu, died, and, his, two, sons, were, defeated, by, another, dajazmach, earl, dajazmach, goshu, of, damot, and, gojjam, kassa, was, forced, to, make, another, start, in, life, and, offered, his, services, to, goshu, kassa, hailu, was, born, into, a, country, rife, with, civil, war, and, he, defeated, many, regional, noblemen, and, princes, before, becoming, emperor, during, time, known, as, the, zemene, mesafint, or, age, of, the, princes, during, this, era, regional, princes, and, noble, lords, of, diverse, ethnic, and, religious, backgrounds, vied, with, each, other, for, power, and, control, of, the, gondarine, emperor, a, puppet, emperor, of, the, solomonic, dynasty, was, enthroned, in, gondar, by, one, nobleman, only, to, be, dethroned, and, replaced, by, another, member, of, the, imperial, dynasty, when, a, different, regional, prince, was, able, to, seize, gondar, and, the, reins, of, power, regions, such, as, gojjam, and, shewa, were, ruled, by, their, own, branches, of, the, imperial, dynasty, and, in, shewa, the, local, prince, went, as, far, as, assuming, the, title, of, king, in, wollo, competing, royal, powerful, oromo, and, muslim, dynasties, also, vied, for, power, nevertheless, a, semblance, of, order, and, unity, was, maintained, in, northern, ethiopia, during, the, era, of, the, princes, by, the, powerful, rases, of, the, were, sheik, dynasty, of, wollo, such, as, ras, ali, the, great, and, ras, gugsa, who, controlled, gondar, and, the, emperor, kassa, began, his, career, in, this, era, as, a, shifta, outlaw, but, after, amassing, a, sizable, force, of, followers, was, able, to, not, only, restore, himself, to, his, father, s, previous, fiefdom, of, qwara, but, was, able, to, control, all, of, dembiya, moreover, he, gained, popular, support, by, his, benevolent, treatment, of, the, inhabitants, in, the, areas, he, controlled, according, to, sven, rubenson, kassa, shared, out, captured, grain, and, money, to, the, peasants, in, qwara, and, told, them, to, buy, hoes, and, plant, this, garnered, notice, of, the, nobleman, in, control, of, gondar, ras, ali, ii, of, yejju, of, wollo, empress, menen, liben, amede, wife, of,

him, firmly, to, her, son, and, herself, although, all, sources, and, authorities, believe, that, kassa, truly, loved, and, respected, his, wife, his, relationship, with, his, new, in, laws, deteriorated, largely, because, of, the, disdainful, treatment, he, repeatedly, received, from, the, empress, menen, by, 1852, he, rebelled, against, ras, ali, and, in, a, series, of, victories, gur, amaba, takusa, ayshal, and, amba, jebelli, over, the, next, three, years, he, defeated, every, army, the, ras, and, the, empress, sent, against, him, at, ayshal, he, captured, the, empress, menen, and, ras, ali, fled, kassa, announced, that, he, was, deposing, emperor, yohannes, iii, and, then, marched, on, his, greatest, remaining, rival, dejazmach, wube, haile, maryam, of, semien, kassa, refused, to, acknowledge, an, attempt, to, restore, the, former, emperor, sahle, dengel, in, the, place, of, the, hapless, yohannes, iii, who, had, acknowledged, kassa, immediately, yohannes, iii, was, treated, well, by, kassa, who, seems, to, have, had, some, personal, sympathy, for, him, his, views, on, sahle, dengel, are, not, known, but, are, not, likely, to, have, been, sympathetic, following, the, defeat, of, dejazmach, wube, kassa, was, crowned, emperor, by, abuna, salama, iii, in, the, church, of, derasge, maryam, on, february, 11, 1855, he, took, the, throne, name, of, tewodros, ii, attempting, to, fulfill, a, prophecy, that, a, man, named, tewodros, would, restore, the, ethiopian, empire, to, greatness, and, rule, for, 40, years, tewodros, ii, s, military, career, started, when, he, served, in, his, relative, kenfu, haile, giorgis, army, in, 1837, he, led, a, successful, attack, on, ottoman, forces, in, the, town, of, gallabat, and, fought, in, the, battle, of, wadkaltabu, where, he, helped, defeat, an, egyptian, raid, his, uncle, dejazmach, kenfu, died, in, 1839, and, qwara, was, lost, to, the, family, and, claimed, by, empress, menen, of, gondar, kassa, hailu, resorted, to, become, a, shifta, one, who, refuses, to, recognize, his, feudal, lord, kassa, hailu, organized, his, own, army, in, the, plains, of, qwara, when, he, became, too, powerful, to, ignore, as, a, way, to, deal, with, him, without, using, force, he, was, named, dajazmach, of, qwara, and, given, the, hand, of, tawabach, the, daughter, of, ras, ali, of, begemder, in, 1845, kassa, was, very, close, to, tawabach, and, devoted, to, his, marriage, but, his, submission, to, empress, menen, was, short, lived, in, october, 1846, he, attacked, and, plundered, dembea, a, city, located, due, south, of, gondar, and, in, january, 1847, he, went, on, to, occupy, gondar, when, kassa, unoccupied, gondar, later, that, year, empress, menen, sent, an, army, after, him, into, north, of, lake, tana, kassa, easily, defeated, the, army, and, took, the, empress, as, prisoner, her, son, ras, ali, of, begemder, chose, to, negotiate, with, kassa, he, gave, kassa, all, lands, west, and, north, of, lake, tana, and, kassa, in, return, released, his, mother, prouty, and, rosenfeld, 1982, 60, the, reconciled, relationship, with, empress, menen, led, him, to, join, up, with, ras, ali, and, ras, goshu, zewde, of, gojam, however, when, conflict, re, emerged, yet, again, in, 1852, kassa, retreated, back, to, qwara, to, re, strengthen, his, troops, in, 1842, tewodros, invaded, egyptian, controlled, sudan, from, western, ethiopia, successfully, capturing, metemma, however, he, suffered, a, major, defeat, in, march, 1848, at, the, battle, of, dabarki, effectively, ending, his, invasion, the, defeat, at, dabarki, led, to, tewodros, taking, efforts, to, modernize, his, military, incorporating, firearm, drills, and, more, modern, artillery, tewodros, sought, to, unify, and, modernise, ethiopia, however, since, he, was, nearly, always, away, on, campaign, during, his, tenure, as, emperor, disloyal, leaders, frequently, tried, to, dislodge, him, while, he, was, away, fighting, within, a, few, years, he, had, forcibly, brought, back, under, direct, imperial, rule, the, kingdom, of, shewa, and, the, province, of, gojjam, he, crushed, the, many, lords, and, princes, of, wollo, and, tigray, and, brought, recalcitrant, regions, of, begemder, and, simien, under, his, direct, rule, he, moved, the, capital, city, of, the, empire, from, gondar, first, to, debre, tabor, and, later, to, magdala, tewodros, ended, the, division, of, ethiopia, among, the, various, regional, lords, and, princes, that, had, vied, among, each, other, for, power, for, almost, two, centuries, he, forcibly, re, incorporated, the, regions, of, gojjam, tigre, shewa, and, wollo, under, the, direct, administration, of, the, imperial, throne, after, they, had, been, ruled, by, local, branches, of, the, imperial, dynasty, in, gojjam, and, shewa, or, other, noblemen, wollo, with, all, of, his, rivals, apparently, subdued, he, imprisoned, them, and, their, relatives, at, magdala, among, the, royal, and, aristocratic, prisoners, at, magdala, was, the, young, prince, of, shewa, sahle, maryam, the, future, emperor, menelik, ii, tewodros, doted, on, the, young, prince, and, married, him, to, his, own, daughter, alitash, tewodros, menelik, would, eventually, escape, from, magdala, and, abandon, his, wife, offending, tewodros, deeply, the, death, of, his, beloved, wife, empress, tewabech, marked, the, start, of, a, deterioration, in, tewodros, ii, s, behavior, increasingly, erratic, and, vengeful, he, gave, full, rein, to, some, of, his, more, brutal, tendencies, now, that, the, calming, influence, of, his, wife, was, absent, for, instance, after, the, murder, of, the, english, traveller, john, bell, who, had, become, the, emperor, s, close, friend, and, confidante, the, emperor, in, revenge, had, 500, prisoners, beheaded, in, debarek, then, in, february, 1863, after, defeating, the, rebel, tedla, gwalu, tewodros, ordered, the, killing, of, the, 7, 000, prisoners, he, had, taken, tewodros, ii, remarried, this, time, to, the, daughter, of, his, imprisoned, enemy, dejazmach, wube, the, new, empress, tiruwork, wube, was, a, proud, and, haughty, woman, very, aware, of, her, illustrious, solomonic, ancestry, she, is, said, to, have, intended, on, the, religious, life, and, becoming, a, nun, especially, after, the, fall, of, her, father, and, his, imprisonment, along, with, her, brothers, at, the, hands, of, tewodros, ii, however, tewodros, request, for, her, hand, in, marriage, was, seen, by, her, family, as, an, opportunity, to, get, dejazmatch, wube, and, his, sons, freed, from, imprisonment, and, so, they, prevailed, on, her, to, marry, the, emperor, however, while, the, conditions, of, their, imprisonment, were, eased, dejazmatch, wube, and, his, sons, were, not, released, deeply, imbittering, empress, tiruwork, against, tewodros, already, feeling, that, she, had, married, far, beneath, her, dignity, to, a, usurper, the, failure, of, the, emperor, to, free, her, family, did, not, help, their, marital, relationship, the, marriage, was, very, far, from, a, happy, one, and, was, extremely, stormy, they, did, have, a, son, dejazmatch, alemayehu, tewodros, whom, the, emperor, adored, and, whom, he, regarded, as, his, heir, by, october, 1862, emperor, tewodros, position, as, ruler, had, become, precarious, much, of, ethiopia, was, in, revolt, against, him, except, for, a, small, area, stretching, from, lake, tana, east, to, his, fortress, at, magdala, ethiopia, he, was, engaged, in, constant, military, campaigns, against, a, wide, array, of, rebels, likewise, abyssinia, was, also, threatened, by, the, encroachment, of, islam, as, muslim, turks, and, egyptians, repeatedly, invaded, ethiopia, from, the, red, sea, and, from, sudan, while, the, muslim, oromo, tribe, was, expanding, throughout, central, ethiopia, tewodros, wrote, a, letter, to, queen, victoria, as, a, fellow, christian, monarch, asking, for, british, assistance, in, the, region, tewodros, asked, the, british, consul, in, ethiopia, captain, charles, duncan, cameron, to, carry, a, letter, to, queen, victoria, requesting, skilled, workers, to, come, to, teach, his, subjects, how, to, produce, firearms, and, other, technical, skills, cameron, traveled, to, the, coast, with, the, letter, but, when, he, informed, the, foreign, office, of, the, letter, and, its, contents, he, was, instructed, to, simply, send, the, letter, to, london, rather, than, take, it, himself, he, was, to, proceed, to, sudan, to, make, inquiries, about, the, slave, trade, there, after, doing, this, cameron, returned, to, ethiopia, on, cameron, s, return, the, emperor, became, enraged, when, he, found, out, that, cameron, had, not, taken, the, letter, to, london, personally, had, not, brought, a, response, from, the, queen, and, most, of, all, had, spent, time, traveling, through, enemy, egyptian, and, turkish, territories, cameron, tried, to, appease, the, emperor, saying, that, a, reply, to, the, letter, would, arrive, shortly, the, foreign, office, in, london, did, not, pass, the, letter, to, queen, victoria, but, simply, filed, it, under, pending, there, the, letter, stayed, for, a, year, then, the, foreign, office, sent, the, letter, to, india, because, abyssinia, came, under, the, raj, s, remit, it, is, alleged, that, when, the, letter, arrived, in, india, officials, filed, it, under, not, even, pending, britain, had, several, reasons, for, ignoring, the, letter, the, british, empire, s, interests, in, northeast, africa, were, quite, different, from, those, of, tewodros, the, british, did, not, want, to, conduct, a, christian, crusade, against, islam, but, instead, to, cooperate, politically, strategically, and, commercially, with, the, ottoman, empire, egypt, and, the, sudan, this, was, not, only, to, protect, the, route, to, india, but, also, to, ensure, that, the, ottoman, empire, continued, to, act, as, a, buffer, against, russia, s, plans, for, expansion, into, central, asia, more, so, as, a, result, of, the, american, civil, war, deliveries, of, cotton, from, the, american, south, to, the, british, textile, industry, were, cut, off, entirely, making, the, british, increasingly, dependent, on, egyptian, sudanese, cotton, the, british, did, not, wish, to, see, a, conflagration, in, the, region, which, would, upset, the, status, quo, after, two, years, had, passed, and, tewodros, had, not, received, a, reply, he, imprisoned, cameron, together, with, all, the, british, subjects, in, ethiopia, and, various, other, europeans, in, an, attempt, to, get, the, queen, s, attention, his, prisoners, included, an, anglican, missionary, named, henry, a, stern, who, had, previously, published, a, book, in, europe, describing, tewodros, as, a, barbaric, cruel, unstable, usurper, when, tewodros, saw, this, book, he, became, violently, angry, pulled, a, gun, on, stern, and, had, to, be, restrained, from, killing, the, missionary, he, then, beat, to, death, the, two, servants, stern, had, brought, with, him, tewodros, also, received, reports, from, abroad, that, foreign, papers, had, quoted, these, european, residents, of, ethiopia, as, having, said, many, negative, things, about, him, and, his, reign, the, british, sent, a, mission, under, an, assyrian, born, british, subject, hormuzd, rassam, who, bore, a, letter, from, the, queen, in, response, to, tewodros, now, three, year, old, letter, requesting, aid, he, did, not, bring, the, skilled, workers, as, tewodros, had, requested, deeply, insulted, by, the, british, failure, to, do, exactly, as, they, were, asked, tewodros, had, the, members, of, the, rassam, mission, added, to, his, other, european, prisoners, this, last, breach, of, diplomatic, immunity, was, the, catalyst, to, britain, launching, the, 1868, expedition, to, abyssinia, under, robert, napier, he, traveled, from, india, then, a, british, colony, with, more, than, 30, 000, personnel, a, force, of, 13, 000, troops, and, 26, 000, camp, followers, which, consisted, of, not, only, soldiers, but, also, specialists, such, as, engineers, tewodros, had, become, increasingly, unpopular, over, the, years, due, to, his, harsh, methods, and, many, regional, figures, had, rebelled, against, him, several, readily, assisted, the, british, by, providing, guides, and, food, as, the, expeditionary, force, marched, towards, magdala, where, the, emperor, had, fortified, the, mountaintop, the, british, force, defeated, the, abyssinian, army, at, arogye, on, the, plain, facing, magdala, on, 10, april, 1868, with, tewodros, army, so, decisively, defeated, many, of, his, men, began, to, desert, and, the, emperor, was, left, with, only, 4, 000, soldiers, tewodros, ii, attempted, to, make, peace, napier, responded, with, a, message, thanking, him, for, this, peace, offering, and, stating, that, he, would, treat, the, emperor, and, his, family, with, every, dignity, tewodros, ii, furiously, responded, that, he, would, never, be, taken, prisoner, the, british, shelled, magdala, which, killed, most, of, tewodros, s, remaining, soldiers, tewodros, released, all, the, europeans, unharmed, but, ordered, 300, ethiopian, prisoners, to, be, flung, over, the, cliff, on, 15, april, 1868, as, the, british, troops, stormed, the, citadel, of, magdala, emperor, tewodros, committed, suicide, rather, than, surrender, a, modern, commentator, states, when, tewodros, preferred, self, inflicted, death, to, captivity, he, deprived, the, british, of, this, ultimate, satisfaction, and, laid, the, foundation, for, his, own, resurrection, as, a, symbol, of, the, defiant, independence, of, the, ethiopian, he, has, been, said, to, have, used, a, pistol, which, he, had, used, during, fighting, for, unification, during, the, era, though, in, reality, he, used, a, duelling, pistol, gifted, to, him, by, queen, victoria, and, presented, by, consul, cameron, tewodros, ii, was, buried, by, the, british, troops, at, magdala, s, medhane, alem, savior, of, the, world, orthodox, church, under, the, name, of, theodore, ii, in, 2019, the, national, army, museum, announced, the, return, to, ethiopia, of, a, lock, of, tewodros, hair, taken, after, his, death, in, battle, magdala, was, in, the, territory, of, the, muslim, oromo, tribes, who, had, long, before, taken, it, from, the, amhara, people, however, tewodros, had, won, it, back, from, them, some, years, earlier, two, rival, oromos, queens, werkait, and, mostiat, had, both, allied, themselves, with, the, british, and, claimed, control, of, the, conquered, fortress, as, a, reward, napier, much, preferred, to, hand, magdala, over, to, the, christian, ruler, of, lasta, wagshum, gobeze, because, if, gobeze, were, in, control, of, the, fortress, he, would, be, able, to, halt, the, oromos, advance, and, assume, responsibility, for, over, 30, 000, christian, refugees, from, tewodros, s, camp, yet, as, gobeze, was, unresponsive, to, these, overtures, much, preferring, to, acquire, tewodros, s, cannons, and, the, two, oromo, queens, could, not, reach, an, arrangement, napier, decided, to, destroy, the, fortress, after, a, thorough, medical, examination, which, confirmed, tewodros, death, as, the, result, of, suicide, the, body, was, dressed, and, laid, out, in, a, hut, by, the, request, of, the, emperor, s, widow, the, body, was, later, buried, in, the, church, of, magdala, lieutenant, stumm, an, eyewitness, described, the, discovery, of, tewodros, s, body, climbing, a, narrow, rock, stairway, we, advanced, quickly, toward, a, second, gate, through, which, we, passed, without, meeting, resistance, about, a, hundred, paces, beyond, it, lay, the, half, naked, body, of, the, emperor, himself, who, had, taken, his, own, life, with, a, pistol, shot, a, strange, smile, was, on, the, remarkably, young, and, attractive, looking, face, and, i, was, struck, particularly, by, the, finely, drawn, boldly, aquiline, nose, after, tewodros, has, been, buried, napier, allowed, his, troops, to, loot, the, citadel, as, a, punitive, measure, according, to, historian, richard, pankhurst, fifteen, elephants, and, almost, 200, mules, were, required, to, carry, away, the, booty, these, became, dispersed, in, museums, and, state, collections, across, europe, though, some, looted, artifacts, have, been, returned, to, ethiopia, tewodros, ii, s, family, later, moved, the, emperor, s, remains, to, the, mahedere, selassie, monastery, in, his, native, qwara, where, they, remain, to, this, day, tewodros, had, asked, his, wife, the, empress, tiruwork, wube, in, the, event, of, his, death, to, put, his, son, prince, alemayehu, under, the, protection, of, the, british, this, decision, was, apparently, made, in, fear, that, his, life, would, be, taken, by, any, aspirant, for, the, empire, of, abyssinia, in, accordance, with, these, wishes, alemayehu, was, taken, to, london, where, he, was, presented, to, queen, victoria, who, took, a, liking, to, the, young, boy, alemayehu, later, studied, at, cheltenham, college, the, rugby, school, and, the, royal, military, academy, sandhurst, however, both, the, queen, and, napier, were, later, concerned, with, the, subsequent, development, of, the, young, prince, who, became, increasingly, lonely, unhappy, and, depressed, during, this, time, in, 1879, the, prince, died, at, the, age, of, 19, he, was, buried, near, the, royal, chapel, in, windsor, with, a, funeral, plaque, placed, to, his, memory, by, queen, victoria, on, a, curious, side, note, many, of, the, hostages, were, unhappy, with, napier, s, demand, that, they, leave, the, country, several, hostages, argued, that, they, had, long, since, become, alienated, from, their, old, homeland, in, europe, and, would, no, longer, have, any, chance, of, building, a, new, life, for, their, families, there, the, german, observer, josef, bechtinger, who, accompanied, the, expedition, wrote, most, of, them, instead, of, thanking, providence, for, their, final, rescue, were, not, all, happy, with, the, new, turn, of, events, they, were, indignant, upset, at, having, to, leave, abyssinia, what, they, said, are, we, supposed, to, do, in, europe, now, what, are, we, supposed, to, do, now, with, our, wives, and, children, back, in, our, homeland, which, has, become, alien, to, us, how, are, we, supposed, to, live, now, among, people, who, have, alien, to, us, and, whom, we, no, longer, like, what, are, we, supposed, to, live, on, bechtinger,

her, ancestors, ruled, although, queen, victoria, subsidised, the, education, at, rugby, of, dejazmatch, alemayehu, tewodros, captain, tristram, speedy, was, appointed, as, his, guardian, he, developed, a, very, strong, attachment, to, captain, speedy, and, his, wife, however, prince, alemayehu, grew, increasingly, lonely, as, the, years, went, by, and, his, compromised, health, made, things, even, harder, he, died, in, october, 1879, at, the, age, of, 19, without, seeing, his, homeland, again, prince, alemayehu, left, an, impression, on, queen, victoria, who, wrote, of, his,
