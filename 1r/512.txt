cappella, choir, all, three, from, 1950, and, a, sonatine, for, violin, and, piano, 1951, in, august, 1951, just, after, his, first, darmstadt, visit, stockhausen, began, working, with, a, form, of, athematic, serial, composition, that, rejected, the, twelve, tone, technique, of, schoenberg, he, characterized, many, of, these, earliest, compositions, together, with, the, music, of, other, like, minded, composers, of, the, period, as, punktuelle, musik, punctual, or, pointist, music, commonly, mistranslated, as, pointillist, though, one, critic, concluded, after, analysing, several, of, these, early, works, that, stockhausen, never, really, composed, punctually, compositions, from, this, phase, include, kreuzspiel, 1951, the, klavierst, cke, i, iv, 1952, the, fourth, of, this, first, set, of, four, klavierst, cke, titled, klavierst, ck, iv, is, specifically, cited, by, stockhausen, as, an, example, of, punctual, music, and, the, first, unpublished, versions, of, punkte, and, kontra, punkte, 1952, however, several, works, from, these, same, years, show, stockhausen, formulating, his, first, really, ground, breaking, contribution, to, the, theory, and, above, all, practice, of, composition, that, of, group, composition, found, in, stockhausen, s, works, as, early, as, 1952, and, continuing, throughout, his, compositional, career, this, principle, was, first, publicly, described, by, stockhausen, in, a, radio, talk, from, december, 1955, titled, gruppenkomposition, klavierst, ck, i, in, december, 1952, he, composed, a, konkrete, et, de, realized, in, pierre, schaeffer, s, paris, musique, concr, te, studio, in, march, 1953, he, moved, to, the, nwdr, studio, in, cologne, and, turned, to, electronic, music, with, two, electronic, studies, 1953, and, 1954, and, then, introducing, spatial, placements, of, sound, sources, with, his, mixed, concr, te, and, electronic, work, gesang, der, j, nglinge, 1955, 56, experiences, gained, from, the, studies, made, plain, that, it, was, an, unacceptable, oversimplification, to, regard, timbres, as, stable, entities, reinforced, by, his, studies, with, meyer, eppler, beginning, in, 1955, stockhausen, formulated, new, statistical, criteria, for, composition, focussing, attention, on, the, aleatoric, directional, tendencies, of, sound, movement, the, change, from, one, state, to, another, with, or, without, returning, motion, as, opposed, to, a, fixed, state, stockhausen, later, wrote, describing, this, period, in, his, compositional, work, the, first, revolution, occurred, from, 1952, 53, as, musique, concr, te, electronic, tape, music, and, space, music, entailing, composition, with, transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc, the, integration, of, all, concrete, and, abstract, synthetic, sound, possibilities, also, all, noises, and, the, controlled, projection, of, sound, in, space, his, position, as, the, leading, german, composer, of, his, generation, was, established, with, gesang, der, j, nglinge, and, three, concurrently, composed, pieces, in, different, media, zeitma, e, for, five, woodwinds, gruppen, for, three, orchestras, and, klavierst, ck, xi, the, principles, underlying, the, latter, three, compositions, are, presented, in, stockhausen, s, best, known, theoretical, article, wie, die, zeit, vergeht, how, time, passes, first, published, in, 1957, in, vol, 3, of, die, reihe, his, work, with, electronic, music, and, its, utter, fixity, led, him, to, explore, modes, of, instrumental, and, vocal, music, in, which, performers, individual, capabilities, and, the, circumstances, of, a, particular, performance, e, g, hall, acoustics, may, determine, certain, aspects, of, a, composition, he, called, this, variable, form, in, other, cases, a, work, may, be, presented, from, a, number, of, different, perspectives, in, zyklus, 1959, for, example, he, began, using, graphic, notation, for, instrumental, music, the, score, is, written, so, that, the, performance, can, start, on, any, page, and, it, may, be, read, upside, down, or, from, right, to, left, as, the, performer, chooses, still, other, works, permit, different, routes, through, the, constituent, parts, stockhausen, called, both, of, these, possibilities, polyvalent, form, which, may, be, either, open, form, essentially, incomplete, pointing, beyond, its, frame, as, with, klavierst, ck, xi, 1956, or, closed, form, complete, and, self, contained, as, with, momente, 1962, 64, 69, in, many, of, his, works, elements, are, played, off, against, one, another, simultaneously, and, successively, in, kontra, punkte, against, points, 1952, 53, which, in, its, revised, form, became, his, official, opus, 1, a, process, leading, from, an, initial, point, texture, of, isolated, notes, toward, a, florid, ornamental, ending, is, opposed, by, a, tendency, from, diversity, six, timbres, dynamics, and, durations, toward, uniformity, timbre, of, solo, piano, a, nearly, constant, soft, dynamic, and, fairly, even, durations, in, gruppen, 1955, 57, fanfares, and, passages, of, varying, speed, superimposed, durations, based, on, the, harmonic, series, are, occasionally, flung, between, three, full, orchestras, giving, the, impression, of, movement, in, space, in, his, kontakte, for, electronic, sounds, optionally, with, piano, and, percussion, 1958, 60, he, achieved, for, the, first, time, an, isomorphism, of, the, four, parameters, of, pitch, duration, dynamics, and, timbre, in, 1960, stockhausen, returned, to, the, composition, of, vocal, music, for, the, first, time, since, gesang, der, j, nglinge, with, carr, for, four, orchestras, and, four, choirs, two, years, later, he, began, an, expansive, cantata, titled, momente, 1962, 64, 69, for, solo, soprano, four, choir, groups, and, thirteen, instrumentalists, in, 1963, stockhausen, created, plus, minus, 2, 7, pages, for, realisation, containing, basic, note, materials, and, a, complex, system, of, transformations, to, which, those, materials, are, to, be, subjected, in, order, to, produce, an, unlimited, number, of, different, compositions, through, the, rest, of, the, 1960s, he, continued, to, explore, such, possibilities, of, process, composition, in, works, for, live, performance, such, as, prozession, 1967, kurzwellen, and, spiral, both, 1968, culminating, in, the, verbally, described, intuitive, music, compositions, of, aus, den, sieben, tagen, 1968, and, f, r, kommende, zeiten, 1968, 70, some, of, his, later, works, such, as, ylem, 1972, and, the, first, three, parts, of, herbstmusik, 1974, also, fall, under, this, rubric, several, of, these, process, compositions, were, featured, in, the, all, day, programmes, presented, at, expo, 70, for, which, stockhausen, composed, two, more, similar, pieces, pole, for, two, players, and, expo, for, three, in, other, compositions, such, as, stop, for, orchestra, 1965, adieu, for, wind, quintet, 1966, and, the, dr, k, sextett, which, was, written, in, 1968, 69, in, honour, of, alfred, kalmus, of, universal, edition, he, presented, his, performers, with, more, restricted, improvisational, possibilities, he, pioneered, live, electronics, in, mixtur, 1964, 67, 2003, for, orchestra, and, electronics, mikrophonie, i, 1964, for, tam, tam, two, microphones, two, filters, with, potentiometers, 6, players, mikrophonie, ii, 1965, for, choir, hammond, organ, and, four, ring, modulators, and, solo, for, a, melody, instrument, with, feedback, 1966, improvisation, also, plays, a, part, in, all, of, these, works, but, especially, in, solo, he, also, composed, two, electronic, works, for, tape, telemusik, 1966, and, hymnen, 1966, 67, the, latter, also, exists, in, a, version, with, partially, improvising, soloists, and, the, third, of, its, four, regions, in, a, version, with, orchestra, at, this, time, stockhausen, also, began, to, incorporate, pre, existent, music, from, world, traditions, into, his, compositions, telemusik, was, the, first, overt, example, of, this, trend, in, 1968, stockhausen, composed, the, vocal, sextet, stimmung, for, the, collegium, vocale, k, ln, an, hour, long, work, based, entirely, on, the, overtones, of, a, low, b, flat, in, the, following, year, he, created, fresco, for, four, orchestral, groups, a, wandelmusik, foyer, music, composition, this, was, intended, to, be, played, for, about, five, hours, in, the, foyers, and, grounds, of, the, beethovenhalle, auditorium, complex, in, bonn, before, after, and, during, a, group, of, in, part, simultaneous, concerts, of, his, music, in, the, auditoriums, of, the, facility, the, overall, project, was, given, the, title, musik, f, r, die, beethovenhalle, this, had, precedents, in, two, collective, composition, seminar, projects, that, stockhausen, gave, at, darmstadt, in, 1967, and, 1968, ensemble, and, musik, f, r, ein, haus, and, would, have, successors, in, the, park, music, composition, for, five, spatially, separated, groups, sternklang, star, sounds, of, 1971, the, orchestral, work, trans, composed, in, the, same, year, and, the, thirteen, simultaneous, musical, scenes, for, soloists, and, duets, titled, alphabet, f, r, li, ge, 1972, since, the, mid, 1950s, stockhausen, had, been, developing, concepts, of, spatialization, in, his, works, not, only, in, electronic, music, such, as, the, 5, channel, gesang, der, j, nglinge, 1955, 56, and, telemusik, 1966, and, 4, channel, kontakte, 1958, 60, and, hymnen, 1966, 67, instrumental, vocal, works, like, gruppen, for, three, orchestras, 1955, 57, and, carr, for, four, orchestras, and, four, choirs, 1959, 60, also, exhibit, this, trait, in, lectures, such, as, music, in, space, from, 1958, he, called, for, new, kinds, of, concert, halls, to, be, built, suited, to, the, requirements, of, spatial, music, his, idea, was, a, spherical, space, which, is, fitted, all, around, with, loudspeakers, in, the, middle, of, this, spherical, space, a, sound, permeable, transparent, platform, would, be, suspended, for, the, listeners, they, could, hear, music, composed, for, such, standardized, spaces, coming, from, above, from, below, and, from, all, points, of, the, compass, in, 1968, the, west, german, government, invited, stockhausen, to, collaborate, on, the, german, pavilion, at, the, 1970, world, fair, in, osaka, and, to, create, a, joint, multimedia, project, for, it, with, artist, otto, piene, other, collaborators, on, the, project, included, the, pavilion, s, architect, fritz, bornemann, fritz, winckel, director, of, the, electronic, music, studio, at, technische, universit, t, berlin, and, engineer, max, mengeringhausen, the, pavilion, theme, was, gardens, of, music, in, keeping, with, which, bornemann, intended, planting, the, exhibition, halls, beneath, a, broad, lawn, with, a, connected, auditorium, sprouting, above, ground, initially, bornemann, conceived, this, auditorium, in, the, form, of, an, amphitheatre, with, a, central, orchestra, podium, and, surrounding, audience, space, in, the, summer, of, 1968, stockhausen, met, with, bornemann, and, persuaded, him, to, change, this, conception, to, a, spherical, space, with, the, audience, in, the, centre, surrounded, by, loudspeaker, groups, in, seven, rings, at, different, latitudes, around, the, interior, walls, of, the, sphere, although, stockhausen, and, piene, s, planned, multimedia, project, titled, hinab, hinauf, was, developed, in, detail, the, world, fair, committee, rejected, their, concept, as, too, extravagant, and, instead, asked, stockhausen, to, present, daily, five, hour, programs, of, his, music, stockhausen, s, works, were, performed, for, 5, hours, every, day, over, a, period, of, 183, days, to, a, total, audience, of, about, a, million, listeners, according, to, stockhausen, s, biographer, michael, kurtz, many, visitors, felt, the, spherical, auditorium, to, be, an, oasis, of, calm, amidst, the, general, hubbub, and, after, a, while, it, became, one, of, the, main, attractions, of, expo, 1970, beginning, with, mantra, for, two, pianos, and, electronics, 1970, stockhausen, turned, to, formula, composition, a, technique, which, involves, the, projection, and, multiplication, of, a, single, double, or, triple, melodic, line, formula, sometimes, as, in, mantra, and, the, large, orchestral, composition, with, mime, soloists, inori, the, simple, formula, is, stated, at, the, outset, as, an, introduction, he, continued, to, use, this, technique, e, g, in, the, two, related, solo, clarinet, pieces, harlekin, and, der, kleine, harlekin, of, 1975, and, the, orchestral, jubil, um, of, 1977, through, the, completion, of, the, opera, cycle, licht, in, 2003, some, works, from, the, 1970s, did, not, employ, formula, technique, e, g, the, vocal, duet, am, himmel, wandre, ich, in, the, sky, i, am, walking, one, of, the, 13, components, of, the, multimedia, alphabet, f, r, li, ge, 1972, which, stockhausen, developed, in, conversation, with, the, british, biophysicist, and, lecturer, on, mystical, aspects, of, sound, vibration, jill, purce, laub, und, regen, leaves, and, rain, from, the, theatre, piece, herbstmusik, 1974, the, unaccompanied, clarinet, composition, amour, and, the, choral, opera, atmen, gibt, das, leben, breathing, gives, life, 1974, 77, but, nevertheless, share, its, simpler, melodically, oriented, style, two, such, pieces, tierkreis, zodiac, 1974, 75, and, in, freundschaft, in, friendship, 1977, a, solo, piece, with, versions, for, virtually, every, orchestral, instrument, have, become, stockhausen, s, most, widely, performed, and, recorded, compositions, this, dramatic, simplification, of, style, provided, a, model, for, a, new, generation, of, german, composers, loosely, associated, under, the, label, neue, einfachheit, or, new, simplicity, the, best, known, of, these, composers, is, wolfgang, rihm, who, studied, with, stockhausen, in, 1972, 73, his, orchestral, composition, sub, kontur, 1974, 75, quotes, the, formula, of, stockhausen, s, inori, 1973, 74, and, he, has, also, acknowledged, the, influence, of, momente, on, this, work, other, large, works, by, stockhausen, from, this, decade, include, the, orchestral, trans, 1971, and, two, music, theatre, compositions, utilizing, the, tierkreis, melodies, musik, im, bauch, music, in, the, belly, for, six, percussionists, 1975, and, the, science, fiction, opera, sirius, 1975, 77, for, eight, channel, electronic, music, with, soprano, bass, trumpet, and, bass, clarinet, which, has, four, different, versions, for, the, four, seasons, each, lasting, over, an, hour, and, a, half, between, 1977, and, 2003, stockhausen, composed, seven, operas, in, a, cycle, titled, licht, die, sieben, tage, der, woche, light, the, seven, days, of, the, week, the, licht, cycle, deals, with, the, traits, associated, in, various, historical, traditions, with, each, weekday, monday, birth, and, fertility, tuesday, conflict, and, war, wednesday, reconciliation, and, cooperation, thursday, traveling, and, learning, etc, and, with, the, relationships, between, three, archetypal, characters, michael, lucifer, and, eve, each, of, these, characters, dominates, one, of, the, operas, donnerstag, samstag, and, montag, respectively, the, three, possible, pairings, are, foregrounded, in, three, others, and, the, equal, combination, of, all, three, is, featured, in, mittwoch, wednesday, stockhausen, s, conception, of, opera, was, based, significantly, on, ceremony, and, ritual, with, influence, from, the, japanese, noh, theatre, as, well, as, judeo, christian, and, vedic, traditions, in, 1968, at, the, time, of, the, composition, of, aus, den, sieben, tagen, stockhausen, had, read, a, biography, by, satprem, about, the, bengali, guru, sri, aurobindo, and, subsequently, he, also, read, many, of, the, published, writings, by, aurobindo, himself, the, title, of, licht, owes, something, to, aurobindo, s, theory, of, agni, the, hindu, and, vedic, fire, deity, developed, from, two, basic, premises, of, nuclear, physics, stockhausen, s, definition, of, a, formula, and, especially, his, conception, of, the, licht, superformula, also, owes, a, great, deal, to, sri, aurobindo, s, category, of, the, supramental, similarly, his, approach, to, voice, and, text, sometimes, departed, from, traditional, usage, characters, were, as, likely, to, be, portrayed, by, instrumentalists, or, dancers, as, by, singers, and, a, few, parts, of, licht, e, g, luzifers, traum, from, samstag, welt, parlament, from, mittwoch, lichter, wasser, and, hoch, zeiten, from, sonntag, use, written, or, improvised, texts, in, simulated, or, invented, languages, the, seven, operas, were, not, composed, in, weekday, order, but, rather, starting, apart, from, jahreslauf, in, 1977, which, became, the, first, act, of, dienstag, with, the, solo, operas, and, working, toward, the, more, complex, ones, donnerstag, 1978, 80, samstag, 1981, 83, montag, 1984, 88, dienstag, 1977, 1987, 91, freitag, 1991, 94, mittwoch, 1995, 97, and, finally, sonntag, 1998, 2003, stockhausen, had, dreams, of, flying, throughout, his, life, and, these, dreams, are, reflected, in, the, helikopter, streichquartett, the, third, scene, of, mittwoch, aus, licht, completed, in, 1993, in, it, the, four, members, of, a, string, quartet, perform, in, four, helicopters, flying, independent, flight, paths, over, the, countryside, near, the, concert, hall, the, sounds, they, play, are, mixed, together, with, the, sounds, of, the, helicopters, and, played, through, speakers, to, the, audience, in, the, hall, videos, of, the, performers, are, also, transmitted, back, to, the, concert, hall, the, performers, are, synchronized, with, the, aid, of, a, click, track, transmitted, to, them, and, heard, over, headphones, the, first, performance, of, the, piece, took, place, in, amsterdam, on, 26, june, 1995, as, part, of, the, holland, festival, despite, its, extremely, unusual, nature, the, piece, has, been, given, several, performances, including, one, on, 22, august, 2003, as, part, of, the, salzburg, festival, to, open, the, hangar, 7, venue, and, the, german, premi, re, on, 17, june, 2007, in, braunschweig, as, part, of, the, stadt, der, wissenschaft, 2007, festival, the, work, has, also, been, recorded, by, the, arditti, quartet, in, 1999, he, was, invited, by, walter, fink, to, be, the, ninth, composer, featured, in, the, annual, komponistenportr, t, of, the, rheingau, musik, festival, in, 1999, bbc, producer, rodney, wilson, asked, stockhausen, to, collaborate, with, stephen, and, timothy, quay, on, a, film, for, the, fourth, series, of, sound, on, film, international, although, stockhausen, s, music, had, been, used, for, films, previously, most, notably, parts, of, hymnen, in, nicolas, roeg, s, walkabout, in, 1971, this, was, the, first, time, he, had, been, asked, to, provide, music, specially, for, the, purpose, he, adapted, 21, minutes, of, material, taken, from, his, electronic, music, for, freitag, aus, licht, calling, the, result, zwei, paare, two, couples, and, the, brothers, quay, created, their, animated, film, which, they, titled, in, absentia, based, only, on, their, reactions, to, the, music, and, the, simple, suggestion, that, a, window, might, be, an, idea, to, use, when, at, a, preview, screening, stockhausen, saw, the, film, which, shows, a, madwoman, writing, letters, from, a, bleak, asylum, cell, he, was, moved, to, tears, the, brothers, quay, were, astonished, to, learn, that, his, mother, had, been, imprisoned, by, the, nazis, in, an, asylum, where, she, later, died, this, was, a, very, moving, moment, for, us, as, well, especially, because, we, had, made, the, film, without, knowing, any, of, this, after, completing, licht, stockhausen, embarked, on, a, new, cycle, of, compositions, based, on, the, hours, of, the, day, klang, sound, twenty, one, of, these, pieces, were, completed, before, stockhausen, s, death, the, first, four, works, from, this, cycle, are, first, hour, himmelfahrt, ascension, for, organ, or, synthesizer, soprano, and, tenor, 2004, 2005, second, hour, freude, joy, for, two, harps, 2005, third, hour, nat, rliche, dauern, natural, durations, for, piano, 2005, 2006, and, fourth, hour, himmels, t, r, heaven, s, door, for, a, percussionist, and, a, little, girl, 2005, the, fifth, hour, harmonien, harmonies, is, a, solo, in, three, versions, for, flute, bass, clarinet, and, trumpet, 2006, the, sixth, through, twelfth, hours, are, chamber, music, works, based, on, the, material, from, the, fifth, hour, the, thirteenth, hour, cosmic, pulses, is, an, electronic, work, made, by, superimposing, 24, layers, of, sound, each, having, its, own, spatial, motion, among, eight, loudspeakers, placed, around, the, concert, hall, hours, 14, through, 21, are, solo, pieces, for, bass, voice, baritone, voice, basset, horn, horn, tenor, voice, soprano, voice, soprano, saxophone, and, flute, respectively, each, with, electronic, accompaniment, of, a, different, set, of, three, layers, from, cosmic, pulses, the, twenty, one, completed, pieces, were, first, performed, together, as, a, cycle, at, the, festival, musiktriennale, k, ln, on, 8, 9, may, 2010, in, 176, individual, concerts, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, stockhausen, published, a, series, of, articles, that, established, his, importance, in, the, area, of, music, theory, although, these, include, analyses, of, music, by, mozart, debussy, bart, k, stravinsky, goeyvaerts, boulez, nono, johannes, fritsch, michael, von, biel, and, especially, webern, the, items, on, compositional, theory, directly, related, to, his, own, work, are, regarded, as, the, most, important, generally, indeed, the, texte, come, closer, than, anything, else, currently, available, to, providing, a, general, compositional, theory, for, the, postwar, period, his, most, celebrated, article, is, wie, die, zeit, vergeht, how, time, passes, first, published, in, the, third, volume, of, die, reihe, 1957, in, it, he, expounds, a, number, of, temporal, conceptions, underlying, his, instrumental, compositions, zeitma, e, gruppen, and, klavierst, ck, xi, in, particular, this, article, develops, 1, a, scale, of, twelve, tempos, analogous, to, the, chromatic, pitch, scale, 2, a, technique, of, building, progressively, smaller, integral, subdivisions, over, a, basic, fundamental, duration, analogous, to, the, overtone, series, 3, musical, application, of, the, concept, of, the, partial, field, time, fields, and, field, sizes, in, both, successive, and, simultaneous, proportions, 4, methods, of, projecting, large, scale, form, from, a, series, of, proportions, 5, the, concept, of, statistical, composition, 6, the, concept, of, action, duration, and, the, associated, variable, form, and, 7, the, notion, of, the, directionless, temporal, field, and, with, it, polyvalent, form, other, important, articles, from, this, period, include, elektronische, und, instrumentale, musik, electronic, and, instrumental, music, 1958, musik, im, raum, music, in, space, 1958, musik, und, graphik, music, and, graphics, 1959, momentform, 1960, die, einheit, der, musikalischen, zeit, the, unity, of, musical, time, 1961, and, erfindung, und, entdeckung, invention, and, discovery, 1961, the, last, summing, up, the, ideas, developed, up, to, 1961, taken, together, these, temporal, theories, suggested, that, the, entire, compositional, structure, could, be, conceived, as, timbre, since, the, different, experienced, components, such, as, colour, harmony, and, melody, meter, and, rhythm, dynamics, and, form, correspond, to, the, different, segmental, ranges, of, this, unified, time, the, total, musical, result, at, any, given, compositional, level, is, simply, the, spectrum, of, a, more, basic, duration, i, e, its, timbre, perceived, as, the, overall, effect, of, the, overtone, structure, of, that, duration, now, taken, to, include, not, only, the, rhythmic, subdivisions, of, the, duration, but, also, their, relative, dynamic, strength, envelope, etc, compositionally, considered, this, produced, a, change, of, focus, from, the, individual, tone, to, a, whole, complex, of, tones, related, to, one, another, by, virtue, of, their, relation, to, a, fundamental, a, change, that, was, probably, the, most, important, compositional, development, of, the, latter, part, of, the, 1950s, not, only, for, stockhausen, s, music, but, for, advanced, music, in, general, some, of, these, ideas, considered, from, a, purely, theoretical, point, of, view, divorced, from, their, context, as, explanations, of, particular, compositions, drew, significant, critical, fire, for, this, reason, stockhausen, ceased, publishing, such, articles, for, a, number, of, years, as, he, felt, that, many, useless, polemics, about, these, texts, had, arisen, and, he, preferred, to, concentrate, his, attention, on, composing, through, the, 1960s, although, he, taught, and, lectured, publicly, stockhausen, published, little, of, an, analytical, or, theoretical, nature, only, in, 1970, did, he, again, begin, publishing, theoretical, articles, with, kriterien, the, abstract, for, his, six, seminar, lectures, for, the, darmst, dter, ferienkurse, the, seminars, themselves, covering, seven, topics, micro, and, macro, continuum, collage, and, metacollage, expansion, of, the, scale, of, tempos, feedback, spectral, harmony, formant, modulation, expansion, of, dynamics, a, principle, of, mikrophonie, i, and, space, music, spatial, forming, and, notation, were, published, only, posthumously, his, collected, writings, were, published, in, texte, zur, musik, including, his, compositional, theories, and, analyses, on, music, as, a, general, phenomenon, stockhausen, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, great, visionaries, of, 20th, century, music, his, two, early, electronic, studies, especially, the, second, had, a, powerful, influence, on, the, subsequent, development, of, electronic, music, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, particularly, in, the, work, of, the, italian, franco, evangelisti, and, the, poles, andrzej, dobrowolski, and, w, odzimierz, koto, ski, the, influence, of, his, kontra, punkte, zeitma, e, and, gruppen, may, be, seen, in, the, work, of, many, composers, including, igor, stravinsky, s, threni, 1957, 58, and, movements, for, piano, and, orchestra, 1958, 59, and, other, works, up, to, the, variations, aldous, huxley, in, memoriam, 1963, 64, whose, rhythms, are, likely, to, have, been, inspired, at, least, in, part, by, certain, passages, from, stockhausen, s, gruppen, though, music, of, stockhausen, s, generation, may, seem, an, unlikely, influence, stravinsky, said, in, a, 1957, conversation, i, have, all, around, me, the, spectacle, of, composers, who, after, their, generation, has, had, its, decade, of, influence, and, fashion, seal, themselves, off, from, further, development, and, from, the, next, generation, as, i, say, this, exceptions, come, to, mind, krenek, for, instance, of, course, it, requires, greater, effort, to, learn, from, one, s, juniors, and, their, manners, are, not, invariably, good, but, when, you, are, seventy, five, and, your, generation, has, overlapped, with, four, younger, ones, it, behooves, you, not, to, decide, in, advance, how, far, composers, can, go, but, to, try, to, discover, whatever, new, thing, it, is, makes, the, new, generation, new, amongst, british, composers, sir, harrison, birtwistle, readily, acknowledges, the, influence, of, stockhausen, s, zeitma, e, especially, on, his, two, wind, quintets, refrains, and, choruses, and, five, distances, and, gruppen, on, his, work, more, generally, brian, ferneyhough, says, that, although, the, technical, and, speculative, innovations, of, klavierst, cke, i, iv, kreuzspiel, and, kontra, punkte, escaped, him, on, first, encounter, they, nevertheless, produced, a, sharp, emotion, the, result, of, a, beneficial, shock, engendered, by, their, boldness, and, provided, an, important, source, of, motivation, rather, than, of, imitation, for, my, own, investigations, while, still, in, school, he, became, fascinated, upon, hearing, the, british, premi, re, of, gruppen, and, listened, many, times, to, the, recording, of, this, performance, while, trying, to, penetrate, its, secrets, how, it, always, seemed, to, be, about, to, explode, but, managed, nevertheless, to, escape, unscathed, in, its, core, but, scarcely, managed, to, grasp, it, retrospectively, it, is, clear, that, from, this, confusion, was, born, my, interest, for, the, formal, questions, which, remain, until, today, although, it, eventually, evolved, in, a, direction, of, its, own, ferneyhough, s, 1967, wind, sextet, prometheus, began, as, a, wind, quintet, with, cor, anglais, stemming, directly, from, an, encounter, with, stockhausen, s, zeitma, e, with, respect, to, stockhausen, s, later, work, he, said, i, have, never, subscribed, whatever, the, inevitable, personal, distance, to, the, thesis, according, to, which, the, many, transformations, of, vocabulary, characterizing, stockhausen, s, development, are, the, obvious, sign, of, his, inability, to, carry, out, the, early, vision, of, strict, order, that, he, had, in, his, youth, on, the, contrary, it, seems, to, me, that, the, constant, reconsideration, of, his, premises, has, led, to, the, maintenance, of, a, remarkably, tough, thread, of, historical, consciousness, which, will, become, clearer, with, time, i, doubt, that, there, has, been, a, single, composer, of, the, intervening, generation, who, even, if, for, a, short, time, did, not, see, the, world, of, music, differently, thanks, to, the, work, of, stockhausen, in, a, short, essay, describing, stockhausen, s, influence, on, his, own, work, richard, barrett, concludes, that, stockhausen, remains, the, composer, whose, next, work, i, look, forward, most, to, hearing, apart, from, myself, of, course, and, names, as, works, that, have, had, particular, impact, on, his, musical, thinking, mantra, gruppen, carr, klavierst, ck, x, inori, and, jubil, um, french, composer, and, conductor, pierre, boulez, once, declared, stockhausen, is, the, greatest, living, composer, and, the, only, one, whom, i, recognize, as, my, peer, boulez, also, acknowledged, the, influence, of, performing, stockhausen, s, zeitma, e, on, his, subsequent, development, as, a, conductor, another, french, composer, jean, claude, loy, regards, stockhausen, as, the, most, important, composer, of, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, cites, virtually, all, his, catalog, of, works, as, a, powerful, discoveration, and, a, true, revelation, dutch, composer, louis, andriessen, acknowledged, the, influence, of, stockhausen, s, momente, in, his, pivotal, work, contra, tempus, of, 1968, german, composer, wolfgang, rihm, who, studied, with, stockhausen, was, influenced, by, momente, hymnen, and, inori, at, the, cologne, iscm, festival, in, 1960, the, danish, composer, per, n, rg, rd, heard, stockhausen, s, kontakte, as, well, as, pieces, by, kagel, boulez, and, berio, he, was, profoundly, affected, by, what, he, heard, and, his, music, suddenly, changed, into, a, far, more, discontinuous, and, disjunct, style, involving, elements, of, strict, organization, in, all, parameters, some, degree, of, aleatoricism, and, controlled, improvisation, together, with, an, interest, in, collage, from, other, musics, jazz, musicians, such, as, miles, davis, charles, mingus, herbie, hancock, yusef, lateef, and, anthony, braxton, cite, stockhausen, as, an, influence, stockhausen, was, influential, within, pop, and, rock, music, as, well, frank, zappa, acknowledges, stockhausen, in, the, liner, notes, of, freak, out, his, 1966, debut, with, the, mothers, of, invention, on, the, back, of, the, who, s, second, lp, released, in, the, us, happy, jack, their, primary, composer, and, guitarist, pete, townshend, is, said, to, have, an, interest, in, stockhausen, rick, wright, and, roger, waters, of, pink, floyd, also, acknowledge, stockhausen, as, an, influence, san, francisco, psychedelic, groups, jefferson, airplane, and, the, grateful, dead, are, said, to, have, done, the, same, stockhausen, said, that, the, grateful, dead, were, well, orientated, toward, new, music, founding, members, of, cologne, based, experimental, band, can, irmin, schmidt, and, holger, czukay, both, studied, with, stockhausen, at, the, cologne, courses, for, new, music, german, electronic, pioneers, kraftwerk, also, say, they, studied, with, stockhausen, and, icelandic, vocalist, bj, rk, has, acknowledged, stockhausen, s, influence, stockhausen, along, with, john, cage, is, one, of, the, few, avant, garde, composers, to, have, succeeded, in, penetrating, the, popular, consciousness, the, beatles, included, his, face, on, the, cover, of, sgt, pepper, s, lonely, hearts, club, band, in, particular, a, day, in, the, life, 1967, and, revolution, 9, 1968, were, influenced, by, stockhausen, s, electronic, music, stockhausen, s, name, and, the, perceived, strangeness, and, supposed, unlistenability, of, his, music, was, even, a, punchline, in, cartoons, as, documented, on, a, page, on, the, official, stockhausen, website, stockhausen, cartoons, perhaps, the, most, caustic, remark, about, stockhausen, was, attributed, to, sir, thomas, beecham, asked, have, you, heard, any, stockhausen, he, is, alleged, to, have, replied, no, but, i, believe, i, have, trodden, in, some, stockhausen, s, fame, is, also, reflected, in, works, of, literature, for, example, he, is, mentioned, in, philip, k, dick, s, 1974, novel, flow, my, tears, the, policeman, said, and, in, thomas, pynchon, s, 1966, novel, the, crying, of, lot, 49, the, pynchon, novel, features, the, scope, a, bar, with, a, strict, electronic, music, policy, protagonist, oedipa, maas, asks, a, hip, graybeard, about, a, sudden, chorus, of, whoops, and, yibbles, coming, out, of, a, kind, of, jukebox, he, replies, that, s, by, stockhausen, the, early, crowd, tends, to, dig, your, radio, cologne, sound, later, on, we, really, swing, the, french, writer, michel, butor, acknowledges, that, stockhausen, s, music, taught, me, a, lot, mentioning, in, particular, the, electronic, works, gesang, der, j, nglinge, and, hymnen, later, in, his, life, stockhausen, was, portrayed, by, at, least, one, journalist, john, o, mahony, of, the, guardian, newspaper, as, an, eccentric, for, example, being, alleged, to, live, an, effectively, polygamous, lifestyle, with, two, women, to, whom, o, mahony, referred, as, his, wives, while, at, the, same, time, stating, he, was, not, married, to, either, of, them, in, the, same, article, o, mahony, says, stockhausen, said, he, was, born, on, a, planet, orbiting, the, star, sirius, in, the, german, newspaper, die, zeit, stockhausen, stated, that, he, was, educated, at, sirius, see, sirius, star, system, below, in, 1995, bbc, radio, 3, sent, stockhausen, a, package, of, recordings, from, contemporary, techno, and, ambient, music, artists, aphex, twin, richie, hawtin, plastikman, scanner, and, daniel, pemberton, and, asked, him, for, his, opinion, on, the, music, in, august, of, that, year, radio, 3, reporter, dick, witts, interviewed, stockhausen, about, these, pieces, for, a, broadcast, in, october, called, the, technocrats, and, asked, what, advice, he, would, give, these, young, musicians, stockhausen, made, suggestions, to, each, and, they, were, then, invited, to, respond, all, but, plastikman, obliged, robin, maconie, finds, that, compared, to, the, work, of, his, contemporaries, stockhausen, s, music, has, a, depth, and, rational, integrity, that, is, quite, outstanding, his, researches, initially, guided, by, meyer, eppler, have, a, coherence, unlike, any, other, composer, then, or, since, maconie, also, compares, stockhausen, to, beethoven, if, a, genius, is, someone, whose, ideas, survive, all, attempts, at, explanation, then, by, that, definition, stockhausen, is, the, nearest, thing, to, beethoven, this, century, has, produced, reason, his, music, lasts, and, as, stravinsky, said, one, never, thinks, of, beethoven, as, a, superb, orchestrator, because, the, quality, of, invention, transcends, mere, craftsmanship, it, is, the, same, with, stockhausen, the, intensity, of, imagination, gives, rise, to, musical, impressions, of, an, elemental, and, seemingly, unfathomable, beauty, arising, from, necessity, rather, than, conscious, design, christopher, ballantine, comparing, the, categories, of, experimental, and, avant, garde, music, concludes, that, perhaps, more, than, any, other, contemporary, composer, stockhausen, exists, at, the, point, where, the, dialectic, between, experimental, and, avant, garde, music, becomes, manifest, it, is, in, him, more, obviously, than, anywhere, else, that, these, diverse, approaches, converge, this, alone, would, seem, to, suggest, his, remarkable, significance, igor, stravinsky, expressed, great, but, not, uncritical, enthusiasm, for, stockhausen, s, music, in, the, conversation, books, with, robert, craft, and, for, years, organised, private, listening, sessions, with, friends, in, his, home, where, he, played, tapes, of, stockhausen, s, latest, works, in, an, interview, published, in, march, 1968, however, he, says, of, an, unidentified, person, i, have, been, listening, all, week, to, the, piano, music, of, a, composer, now, greatly, esteemed, for, his, ability, to, stay, an, hour, or, so, ahead, of, his, time, but, i, find, the, alternation, of, note, clumps, and, silences, of, which, it, consists, more, monotonous, than, the, foursquares, of, the, dullest, eighteenth, century, music, the, following, october, a, report, in, sovetskaia, muzyka, translated, this, sentence, and, a, few, others, from, the, same, article, into, russian, substituting, for, the, conjunction, but, the, phrase, ia, imeiu, v, vidu, karlkheintsa, shtokkhauzena, i, am, referring, to, karlheinz, stockhausen, when, this, translation, was, quoted, in, druskin, s, stravinsky, biography, the, field, was, widened, to, all, of, stockhausen, s, compositions, and, druskin, adds, for, good, measure, indeed, works, he, calls, unnecessary, useless, and, uninteresting, again, quoting, from, the, same, sovetskaia, muzyka, article, even, though, it, had, made, plain, that, the, characterization, was, of, american, university, composers, throughout, his, career, stockhausen, excited, controversy, one, reason, for, this, is, that, his, music, displays, high, expectations, about, shaping, and, transforming, the, world, about, the, truth, of, life, and, of, reality, about, the, creative, departure, into, a, future, determined, by, spirit, so, that, stockhausen, s, work, like, no, other, in, the, history, of, new, music, has, a, polarizing, effect, arouses, passion, and, provokes, drastic, opposition, even, hatred, another, reason, was, acknowledged, by, stockhausen, himself, in, a, reply, to, a, question, during, an, interview, on, the, bavarian, radio, on, 4, september, 1960, reprinted, as, a, foreword, to, his, first, collection, of, writings, i, have, often, been, reproached, especially, recently, for, being, too, candid, and, through, this, making, not, a, few, enemies, for, myself, being, undiplomatic, it, must, be, admitted, i, am, not, gifted, as, an, esotericist, not, as, a, mystic, or, a, hermit, and, not, as, a, diplomat, it, corresponds, that, my, love, of, my, fellow, humans, expresses, itself, in, candour, i, hope, my, enemies, will, not, on, this, account, destroy, me, i, also, hope, my, enemies, find, forms, of, retort, that, i, can, find, richly, fanciful, witty, pertinent, instructive, that, grant, me, respect, through, a, noble, and, truly, humane, form, of, enmity, after, the, student, revolts, in, 1968, musical, life, in, germany, became, highly, politicized, and, stockhausen, found, himself, a, target, for, criticism, especially, from, the, leftist, camp, who, wanted, music, in, the, service, of, the, class, struggle, cornelius, cardew, and, konrad, boehmer, denounced, their, former, teacher, as, a, servant, of, capitalism, in, a, climate, where, music, mattered, less, than, political, ideology, some, critics, held, that, stockhausen, was, too, litist, while, others, complained, he, was, too, mystical, as, reported, in, the, german, magazine, der, spiegel, the, premi, re, and, only, performance, to, date, on, 15, november, 1969, of, stockhausen, s, work, fresco, for, four, orchestral, groups, playing, in, four, different, locations, was, the, scene, of, a, scandal, the, rehearsals, were, already, marked, by, objections, from, the, orchestral, musicians, questioning, such, directions, as, glissandos, no, faster, than, one, octave, per, minute, and, others, phoning, the, artists, union, to, clarify, whether, they, really, had, to, perform, the, stockhausen, work, as, part, of, the, orchestra, in, the, backstage, warm, up, room, at, the, premiere, a, hand, lettered, sign, could, be, seen, saying, we, re, playing, otherwise, we, would, be, fired, during, the, premi, re, the, parts, on, some, music, stands, suddenly, were, replaced, by, placards, reading, things, like, stockhausen, zoo, please, don, t, feed, that, someone, had, planted, some, musicians, fed, up, with, the, monkeyshines, left, after, an, hour, though, the, performance, was, planned, for, four, to, five, hours, stockhausen, fans, protested, while, stockhausen, foes, were, needling, the, musicians, asking, how, can, you, possibly, participate, in, such, crap, wie, k, nnt, ihr, blo, so, eine, schei, e, machen, at, one, point, someone, managed, to, switch, off, the, stand, lights, leaving, the, musicians, in, the, dark, after, 260, minutes, the, performance, ended, with, no, one, participating, any, longer, in, an, obituary, in, the, german, newspaper, die, zeit, karlheinz, stockhausen, was, quoted, as, having, said, i, was, educated, at, sirius, and, want, to, return, to, there, although, i, am, still, living, in, k, rten, near, cologne, on, hearing, about, this, conductor, michael, gielen, stated, when, he, said, he, knew, what, was, happening, at, sirius, i, turned, away, from, him, in, horror, i, haven, t, listened, to, a, note, since, he, called, stockhausen, s, statements, hubris, and, nonsense, while, at, the, same, time, defending, his, own, belief, in, astrology, why, should, these, large, celestial, bodies, exist, if, they, do, not, stand, for, something, i, cannot, imagine, that, there, is, anything, senseless, in, the, universe, there, is, much, we, do, not, understand, in, a, press, conference, in, hamburg, on, 16, september, 2001, stockhausen, was, asked, by, a, journalist, whether, the, characters, in, licht, were, for, him, merely, some, figures, out, of, a, common, cultural, history, or, rather, material, appearances, stockhausen, replied, i, pray, daily, to, michael, but, not, to, lucifer, i, have, renounced, him, but, he, is, very, much, present, like, in, new, york, recently, the, same, journalist, then, asked, how, the, events, of, 11, september, had, affected, him, and, how, he, viewed, reports, of, the, attack, in, connection, with, the, harmony, of, humanity, represented, in, hymnen, he, answered, well, what, happened, there, is, of, course, now, all, of, you, must, adjust, your, brains, the, biggest, work, of, art, there, has, ever, been, the, fact, that, spirits, achieve, with, one, act, something, which, we, in, music, could, never, dream, of, that, people, practise, ten, years, madly, fanatically, for, a, concert, and, then, die, and, that, is, the, greatest, work, of, art, that, exists, for, the, whole, cosmos, just, imagine, what, happened, there, there, are, people, who, are, so, concentrated, on, this, single, performance, and, then, five, thousand, people, are, driven, to, resurrection, in, one, moment, i, couldn, t, do, that, compared, to, that, we, are, nothing, as, composers, it, is, a, crime, you, know, of, course, because, the, people, did, not, agree, to, it, they, did, not, come, to, the, concert, that, is, obvious, and, nobody, had, told, them, you, could, be, killed, in, the, process, as, a, result, of, the, reaction, to, the, press, report, of, stockhausen, s, comments, a, four, day, festival, of, his, work, in, hamburg, was, cancelled, in, addition, his, pianist, daughter, announced, to, the, press, that, she, would, no, longer, appear, under, the, name, stockhausen, in, a, subsequent, message, he, stated, that, the, press, had, published, false, defamatory, reports, about, his, comments, and, said, at, the, press, conference, in, hamburg, i, was, asked, if, michael, eve, and, lucifer, were, historical, figures, of, the, past, and, i, answered, that, they, exist, now, for, example, lucifer, in, new, york, in, my, work, i, have, defined, lucifer, as, the, cosmic, spirit, of, rebellion, of, anarchy, he, uses, his, high, degree, of, intelligence, to, destroy, creation, he, does, not, know, love, after, further, questions, about, the, events, in, america, i, said, that, such, a, plan, appeared, to, be, lucifer, s, greatest, work, of, art, of, course, i, used, the, designation, work, of, art, to, mean, the, work, of, destruction, personified, in, lucifer, in, the, context, of, my, other, comments, this, was, unequivocal, amongst, the, numerous, honours, and, distinctions, that, were, bestowed, upon, stockhausen,
