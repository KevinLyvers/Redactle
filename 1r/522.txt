two, autobiographies, rubinstein, is, often, intensely, self, critical, a, natural, pianist, with, a, big, technique, he, claimed, that, he, practiced, as, little, as, possible, learning, new, pieces, quickly, and, with, insufficient, attention, to, detail, relying, on, his, charm, and, charisma, to, conceal, the, lack, of, finish, in, his, playing, the, literal, truth, of, these, self, directed, critiques, is, open, to, question, rubinstein, wasn, t, averse, to, making, himself, the, butt, of, a, good, story, even, so, he, insisted, that, his, attitude, toward, practicing, changed, after, his, marriage, he, stated, that, he, did, not, want, his, children, to, see, him, as, a, second, rater, so, he, began, in, the, summer, of, 1934, to, restudy, his, entire, repertoire, i, buckled, down, back, to, work, six, hours, eight, hours, nine, hours, a, day, he, recalled, in, 1958, and, a, strange, thing, happened, i, began, to, discover, new, meanings, new, qualities, new, possibilities, in, music, that, i, have, been, regularly, playing, for, more, than, 30, years, in, general, however, rubinstein, believed, that, excessive, practice, could, be, dangerous, for, young, pianists, perhaps, recalling, his, own, youthful, brush, with, repetitive, stress, syndrome, rubinstein, regularly, advised, that, young, pianists, should, practice, no, more, than, three, hours, a, day, i, was, born, very, very, lazy, and, i, don, t, always, practice, very, long, he, said, but, i, must, say, in, my, defense, that, it, is, not, so, good, in, a, musical, way, to, overpractice, when, you, do, the, music, seems, to, come, out, of, your, pocket, if, you, play, with, a, feeling, of, oh, i, know, this, you, play, without, that, little, drop, of, fresh, blood, that, is, necessary, and, the, audience, feels, it, of, his, own, practice, methods, he, said, at, every, concert, i, leave, a, lot, to, the, moment, i, must, have, the, unexpected, the, unforeseen, i, want, to, risk, to, dare, i, want, to, be, surprised, by, what, comes, out, i, want, to, enjoy, it, more, than, the, audience, that, way, the, music, can, bloom, anew, it, s, like, making, love, the, act, is, always, the, same, but, each, time, it, s, different, rubinstein, was, reluctant, to, teach, in, his, earlier, life, refusing, to, accept, william, kapell, s, request, for, lessons, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1950s, that, he, accepted, his, first, pupil, dubravka, tom, i, srebotnjak, other, pupils, of, rubinstein, include, fran, ois, ren, duch, ble, avi, sch, nfeld, ann, schein, carlyss,
