lilie, naming, after, this, coat, of, arms, distinguishes, this, line, of, the, fugger, family, from, the, of, the, doe, german, vom, reh, branch, until, 2009, historians, assumed, that, jakob, fugger, who, was, a, minor, order, at, the, age, of, 12, had, lived, as, a, canon, in, a, church, located, in, herrieden, a, document, from, the, austrian, state, archive, has, now, shown, that, jakob, fugger, was, already, representing, his, family, business, in, venice, in, 1473, at, the, age, of, 14, other, research, showed, that, jakob, fugger, spent, the, years, between, 1473, and, 1487, mostly, at, the, fondaco, dei, tedeschi, the, house, of, german, merchants, in, venice, venice, being, one, of, the, most, important, centers, of, trade, at, the, time, proved, to, be, an, ideal, environment, for, jakob, fugger, s, education, in, banking, and, the, metal, trade, his, long, residence, in, italy, also, helped, bring, the, renaissance, style, to, the, german, region, with, his, funding, the, construction, of, the, first, buildings, of, this, style, that, originated, in, italy, legal, and, architectural, structures, of, venice, also, had, a, significant, influence, on, the, funding, of, the, fuggerei, which, was, similar, to, the, social, housing, of, venice, jakob, fugger, laid, the, foundation, of, his, mining, business, in, salzburg, he, provided, loans, to, the, independent, silver, mine, owners, in, the, salzburg, slate, alps, which, had, constant, need, for, new, capital, instead, of, receiving, the, usual, documents, acknowledging, debt, he, demanded, kuxe, which, essentially, made, him, a, shareholder, in, the, mines, through, this, he, forced, more, and, more, mine, operators, in, the, area, of, gastein, and, schladming, to, sell, their, silver, directly, to, the, fugger, family, instead, of, intermediary, traders, jakob, fugger, was, responsible, for, his, family, s, business, in, augsburg, tyrol, venice, and, rome, around, 1485, the, family, also, founded, manufactories, in, innsbruck, since, 1510, in, hall, since, 1539, in, schwaz, through, a, small, loan, he, there, first, came, into, contact, with, archduke, sigismund, a, member, of, the, habsburg, family, the, archduke, had, as, the, sole, owner, of, the, tyrol, property, rights, handed, out, permissions, for, mining, operations, to, private, investors, which, in, return, had, to, pay, a, share, of, their, profits, to, sigismund, despite, this, income, he, was, constantly, short, of, money, owing, to, a, lavish, lifestyle, several, illegitimate, children, and, his, extensive, construction, projects, a, responsibility, to, pay, the, amount, of, 100, 000, guilders, of, war, reparations, to, venice, was, eventually, financed, by, jakob, fugger, in, 1488, the, total, debt, already, amounted, to, more, than, 150, 000, guilders, notable, was, the, form, of, payment, instead, of, paying, the, f, rst, directly, the, fugger, family, paid, the, money, to, his, creditors, as, well, as, providing, the, wages, for, the, royal, court, and, craftsmen, fugger, met, an, engineer, by, the, name, of, jan, thurzo, and, they, formed, a, powerful, copper, company, in, the, neighbouring, town, of, bansk, bystrica, in, 1495, in, 1517, the, fugger, family, financed, more, than, half, of, tyrol, s, public, budget, as, a, result, they, were, at, times, entitled, to, all, the, silver, and, copper, out, of, tyrol, the, expansion, of, high, risk, albeit, very, lucrative, business, connections, to, maximilian, i, was, undoubtedly, promoted, by, fugger, in, his, view, the, house, of, habsburg, was, bound, to, be, the, dominant, power, and, dynasty, within, the, german, region, and, as, such, should, receive, his, financial, and, political, support, jakob, fugger, met, the, young, roman, german, king, for, the, first, time, in, 1489, at, a, frankfurt, fair, at, that, time, his, plans, for, the, independent, duchy, of, tyrol, had, been, agreed, upon, with, the, king, s, chancellor, johann, waldner, on, 16, march, 1490, sigismund, and, the, tyrol, estates, came, together, with, king, maximilian, also, present, the, archduke, had, to, resign, under, the, pressure, from, the, estates, who, accused, him, of, mismanagement, and, his, possessions, fell, to, the, king, maximilian, then, promised, to, repay, all, loans, of, its, predecessor, to, jakob, fugger, thus, the, fugger, business, became, one, of, the, most, important, financial, backers, of, maximilian, who, since, 1486, was, co, regent, of, the, holy, roman, empire, after, his, father, frederick, iii, died, in, 1493, he, became, the, reigning, emperor, despite, having, constant, financial, difficulties, due, to, an, extravagant, lifestyle, and, many, failed, political, projects, his, reign, saw, the, kingdoms, of, spain, bohemia, and, hungary, gained, for, the, house, of, habsburg, not, by, waging, war, but, through, advantageous, marriage, arrangements, which, were, funded, with, the, help, of, jakob, fugger, on, 15, july, 1507, maximilian, i, sold, the, county, of, kirchberg, located, at, ulm, the, adjacent, lordship, wei, enhorn, with, the, associated, city, as, well, as, the, lordships, wullenstetten, and, pfaffenhofen, roth, from, the, habsburg, possessions, in, further, austria, to, jakob, fugger, maximilian, i, who, crowned, himself, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1508, received, a, payment, of, 50, 000, guilders, for, these, sales, more, sales, followed, in, 1508, where, he, sold, manor, schmiechen, and, in, 1514, where, he, sold, the, lordship, biberbach, to, fugger, maximilian, i, elevated, jakob, fugger, into, nobility, in, 1511, and, granted, him, the, title, of, imperial, count, in, 1514, so, the, former, burgher, could, operate, his, business, without, interference, from, local, nobility, in, the, course, of, his, life, jakob, fugger, also, became, lord, of, more, than, 50, smaller, villages, criticism, from, reformer, martin, luther, on, the, fugger, business, methods, and, novelistic, portrayal, from, early, research, have, led, to, the, notion, that, jakob, fugger, exercised, considerable, power, over, maximilian, i, the, king, and, emperor, of, the, holy, roman, empire, while, more, recent, research, shows, that, this, was, only, partially, true, however, close, to, the, end, of, his, life, maximilian, was, so, heavily, indebted, to, jakob, fugger, that, he, had, no, choice, but, to, continue, his, support, for, the, emperor, to, still, be, able, reclaim, his, outstanding, debits, when, maximilian, s, grandson, charles, v, stood, for, election, to, become, the, next, emperor, jakob, fugger, raised, a, sum, of, more, than, 500, 000, guilders, a, significant, portion, of, his, wealth, and, of, the, total, amount, raised, in, his, support, to, ensure, the, seven, prince, electors, would, choose, him, thereby, he, helped, prevent, the, election, of, francis, i, of, france, which, would, have, endangered, his, claims, and, investments, gravely, although, it, also, made, him, highly, dependent, on, the, house, of, habsburg, much, later, the, fugger, family, lost, a, large, portion, of, their, wealth, following, three, spanish, state, bankruptcies, 1557, 1560, and, 1575, under, the, reign, of, philip, ii, of, spain, likely, at, the, insistence, of, jakob, fugger, the, company, became, one, of, the, first, open, trading, companies, german, der, compagnia, palese, des, welschen, rechts, in, europe, in, 1494, at, the, same, time, it, was, renamed, into, ulrich, fugger, of, augsburg, and, brothers, to, show, the, equality, of, the, three, brothers, involved, in, business, issues, even, though, tyrolean, sources, almost, universally, speak, of, the, jakob, fugger, company, and, central, contracts, of, the, hungarian, trade, were, all, signed, by, him, at, this, development, the, greatly, increased, influence, of, jakob, within, the, company, can, be, observed, during, the, late, 1480s, jakob, fugger, dominated, the, company, s, policies, although, the, eldest, brother, ulrich, still, formally, led, the, company, the, enormous, growth, potential, in, the, mining, and, ore, trade, was, very, profitably, harnessed, by, jakob, fugger, in, the, following, years, as, collateral, for, loans, that, he, had, given, to, the, habsburgs, and, the, king, of, hungary, he, demanded, mine, revenues, of, tyrol, and, the, transfer, of, mining, rights, in, upper, hungary, to, him, through, this, method, he, eventually, established, a, dominant, and, almost, monopolistic, hold, on, the, copper, trade, in, central, europe, with, his, business, partner, hans, thurz, he, founded, the, hungarian, trade, in, 1494, mines, funded, by, fugger, were, constructed, in, neusohl, present, day, bansk, bystrica, slovakia, at, the, time, part, of, the, hungarian, kingdom, the, expansion, continued, with, the, construction, of, smelting, plants, in, neusohl, and, nearby, moschnitz, arnoldstein, in, carinthia, hohenkirchen, in, thuringia, the, copper, was, distributed, through, manufactories, in, breslau, leipzig, krak, w, and, ofen, for, transportation, to, the, ports, of, gda, sk, stettin, and, l, beck, on, the, baltic, sea, fugger, funded, the, construction, of, a, new, road, across, the, jablunkov, pass, from, those, ports, the, copper, was, shipped, to, the, russian, region, and, additionally, through, antwerp, to, lisbon, where, it, was, an, important, portuguese, trade, good, destined, for, the, export, to, india, part, of, the, copper, was, also, transported, through, wiener, neustadt, and, the, adriatic, ports, triest, and, zengg, to, the, copper, market, in, venice, at, the, time, mines, from, both, tyrol, and, hungary, provided, the, bulk, of, the, total, european, production, in, copper, which, provided, an, incredibly, advantageous, position, in, the, european, market, albeit, not, a, total, monopoly, the, fugger, family, were, the, first, german, trading, house, in, a, direct, business, relationship, with, the, roman, curia, in, the, year, 1500, jakob, fugger, loaned, the, vatican, the, money, necessary, to, build, the, new, st, peter, s, basilica, the, sistine, chapel, as, well, as, other, buildings, within, the, vatican, to, repay, jakob, the, massive, amount, of, money, owed, pope, leo, x, had, to, heavily, tax, the, german, people, as, well, as, sell, indulgences, which, was, heavily, unpopular, with, a, large, group, of, monks, including, martin, luther, partly, because, of, the, corruption, within, the, church, martin, luther, was, prompted, to, write, his, ninety, five, theses, following, the, death, of, pope, alexander, vi, in, august, 1503, jakob, fugger, intensified, his, contacts, to, the, vatican, in, rome, for, the, new, pope, julius, ii, fugger, financed, the, recruitment, in, 1505, 1506, of, the, swiss, guard, which, still, exists, today, early, dealings, in, rome, are, attributed, to, the, cleric, markus, fugger, in, 1473, in, 1477, the, fugger, business, was, responsible, for, transferring, church, revenues, from, sweden, to, rome, between, 1508, and, 1524, the, company, leased, the, roman, mint, the, zecca, manufacturing, 66, types, of, coins, for, four, different, popes, after, this, the, fugger, family, was, represented, by, only, one, manufactory, in, rome, mostly, due, to, the, 1527, sack, of, rome, and, the, less, german, friendly, medici, pope, clement, vii, the, commodity, trade, played, a, relatively, small, role, compared, to, the, two, main, branches, of, the, fugger, business, banking, and, mining, it, is, only, because, of, the, associated, exotic, investments, that, jakob, fugger, s, early, trading, expeditions, take, a, prominent, place, in, the, history, of, the, fugger, business, after, vasco, da, gama, s, discovery, of, the, sea, route, to, india, and, the, establishment, of, the, portuguese, spice, monopoly, jakob, fugger, took, part, in, the, spice, trade, and, in, 1503, opened, a, manufactory, in, lisbon, he, received, permission, to, trade, pepper, other, spices, and, luxury, goods, such, as, pearls, and, gemstones, through, lisbon, along, with, other, merchant, houses, of, germany, and, italy, he, contributed, to, a, fleet, of, 22, portuguese, ships, led, by, francisco, de, almeida, that, sailed, to, india, in, the, year, 1505, and, returned, in, 1506, even, though, one, third, of, the, imported, wares, had, to, be, ceded, to, the, king, of, portugal, the, operation, was, still, profitable, soon, afterwards, the, king, declared, the, spice, trade, a, monopoly, of, the, crown, in, order, to, secure, his, income, and, exclude, foreign, merchants, from, participating, however, the, portuguese, were, still, largely, dependent, on, the, copper, delivered, by, fugger, which, was, an, essential, export, good, for, the, trade, with, india, unlike, the, welser, family, jakob, fugger, s, participation, in, the, overseas, trade, was, very, cautious, and, conservative, and, the, only, other, operation, of, this, kind, he, invested, in, was, a, failed, 1525, trade, expedition, to, the, maluku, islands, led, by, the, spaniard, garcia, de, loaisa, there, is, some, evidence, that, he, financed, magellan, s, famed, voyage, especially, for, mining, projects, in, upper, hungary, the, fugger, company, required, enormous, capital, which, at, the, time, it, could, not, raise, hence, cardinal, melchior, von, meckau, was, the, main, sponsor, of, the, fugger, business, in, 1496, the, prince, bishop, had, secretly, and, unknown, to, his, church, chapter, invested, 150, 000, guilders, in, the, fugger, company, in, return, for, interest, thereby, evading, the, official, church, ban, on, interest, when, he, died, in, rome, in, 1509, this, investment, was, uncovered, the, pope, the, bishopric, brixen, and, the, family, of, meckau, all, claiming, the, inheritance, now, demanded, the, immediate, payback, of, these, assets, which, would, have, resulted, in, insolvency, for, jakob, fugger, it, was, this, situation, that, prompted, emperor, maximilian, i, to, step, in, and, assist, his, banker, on, the, condition, of, assisting, pope, julius, ii, in, a, war, against, the, republic, of, venice, the, habsburg, monarch, was, recognized, as, being, the, rightful, heir, of, cardinal, melchior, von, meckau, the, inheritance, could, now, be, settled, by, amortizing, outstanding, debts, fugger, also, had, to, deliver, jewels, as, compensation, to, the, pope, however, in, return, for, his, support, maximilian, i, demanded, the, continuous, financial, support, of, his, ongoing, military, and, political, campaigns, since, the, death, of, his, brothers, georg, in, 1506, and, ulrich, in, 1510, jakob, fugger, was, now, running, the, fugger, business, as, the, sole, policy, and, decision, maker, the, company, was, renamed, into, jakob, fugger, und, gebr, der, s, hne, jakob, fugger, and, brother, s, sons, in, the, following, years, up, until, his, death, jakob, fugger, managed, to, raise, the, family, fortune, which, amounted, to, about, 200, 000, guilders, in, 1511, to, more, than, two, million, guilders, perhaps, 2, of, europe, s, gdp, emperor, maximilian, died, in, january, 1519, and, bequeathed, to, his, grandson, charles, the, hereditary, lands, of, house, habsburg, with, adjoining, burgundian, lands, as, well, as, a, disputed, claim, to, the, throne, of, the, holy, roman, empire, to, secure, his, essential, investments, into, house, habsburg, jakob, fugger, decided, to, support, the, election, of, the, 19, year, old, claimant, to, the, throne, in, addition, to, charles, the, english, king, henry, viii, the, french, king, francis, i, and, frederick, iii, elector, of, saxony, announced, their, candidacy, francis, i, had, already, secured, the, votes, of, the, archdiocese, of, trier, and, the, electorate, of, the, palatinate, as, well, as, offering, a, sum, of, 300, 000, guilders, of, election, money, the, prince, electors, consisted, of, the, three, archbishops, of, mainz, cologne, and, trier, in, addition, to, the, king, of, bohemia, the, elector, of, the, palatinate, the, margrave, of, brandenburg, and, the, duke, of, saxony, this, was, a, difficult, situation, for, charles, who, now, relied, on, the, riches, of, jakob, fugger, to, sway, the, election, in, his, favor, fugger, transferred, the, enormous, sum, of, more, than, 850, 000, guilders, to, the, prince, electors, which, ultimately, resulted, in, the, unanimous, election, of, charles, holy, roman, emperor, on, 28, july, 1519, out, of, this, 850, 000, guilders, fugger, himself, funded, around, 550, 000, while, another, merchant, house, of, augsburg, the, welser, family, contributed, about, 150, 000, and, three, italian, bankers, providing, the, rest, what, today, would, be, seen, as, bribery, was, common, practice, in, the, election, of, the, emperor, exceptional, however, were, the, immense, sums, involved, mainly, due, to, the, keen, competition, among, the, princely, candidates, a, few, days, later, the, pope, granted, charles, the, right, to, name, himself, elected, emperor, it, was, only, in, 1530, that, charles, v, was, crowned, emperor, by, the, pope, in, bologna, he, was, the, last, emperor, to, receive, a, papal, coronation, charles, v, since, his, election, reigning, over, a, realm, where, the, sun, never, set, was, now, deeply, indebted, to, jakob, fugger, in, 1521, the, debts, amounted, to, more, than, 600, 000, guilders, the, emperor, amortized, 415, 000, of, this, sum, and, in, return, granted, the, fugger, company, the, silver, and, copper, mining, operations, of, tyrol, during, the, imperial, diet, of, 1523, in, nuremberg, it, was, debated, whether, to, restrict, trade, capital, and, the, number, of, trade, establishments, companies, were, allowed, to, maintain, jakob, fugger, intervened, and, reminded, the, emperor, that, it, is, known, that, your, imperial, majesty, could, not, have, claimed, the, roman, crown, without, my, help, german, es, ist, auch, wissentlich, und, liegt, am, tage, dass, eure, kaiserliche, majest, t, die, r, mische, krone, ohne,

as, archbishop, of, mainz, for, this, choice, violated, the, canonical, prohibition, to, hold, more, than, one, bishopric, albert, also, did, not, meet, the, requirements, for, taking, over, a, diocese, since, the, 24, year, old, had, not, yet, reached, the, appropriate, age, and, did, not, have, a, university, degree, and, therefore, needed, a, study, leave, for, which, the, curia, charged, a, high, processing, fee, in, 1514, albert, suggested, to, pope, leo, x, that, a, special, indulgence, be, announced, in, his, three, dioceses, as, well, as, in, his, native, diocese, of, brandenburg, and, that, half, of, the, income, should, be, used, for, the, construction, of, the, new, st, peter, s, basilica, and, half, for, his, repayments, to, jakob, fugger, an, according, papal, bull, was,

albert, employed, johann, tetzel, for, the, actual, preaching, of, the, indulgence, later, martin, luther, then, professor, of, theology, in, wittenberg, addressed, a, letter, of, protest, to, albert, concerning, the, conduct, of, tetzel, largely, in, reaction, to, tetzel, s, actions, luther, wrote, his, famous, ninety, five, theses, which, led, to, the, reformation, after, the, diet, of, augsburg, in, 1518, luther, had, to, answer, for, his, theses, in, the, fugger, house, before, cardinal, thomas, cajetan, who, had, been, commissioned, by, the, pope, when, luther, refused, to, retract, his, theses, he, had, to, flee, the, city, at, night, the, citizens, of, augsburg, now, demanded, the, unhindered, spread, of, the, evangelical, faith, which, brought, jakob, fugger, who, preferred, to, remain, catholic, and, thus, remain, loyal, to, the, emperor, especially, since, he, operated, his, mines, in, habsburg, lands, and, had, very, high, outstanding, debts, with, the, emperor, into, contrast, to, the, majority, of, his, fellow, citizens, the, fugger, family, largely, financed, the, house, of, habsburg, who, would, play, a, prominent, role, in, the, counter, reformation, fugger, insisted, that, only, catholic, inhabitants, should, find, care, and, cure, in, his, fuggerei, as, the, reformation, progressed, the, complex, found, itself, located, in, an, increasingly, protestant, city, of, augsburg, only, a, few, years, after, jakob, fugger, s, death, the, augsburg, confession, by, philip, melanchthon, was, formulated, at, the, diet, of, augsburg, in, 1530, the, confessio, augustana, represents, the, confessional, and, founding, document, of, the, lutheran, church, the, descendants, of, jakob, fugger, have, remained, catholic, to, this, day, together, with, his,

built, in, preparation, for, fugger, s, elevation, into, nobility, and, to, distance, himself, from, the, local, patricians, furthermore, it, was, a, medium, to, preserve, the, name, and, memory, of, fugger, in, the, style, of, the, italian, memoria, architecture, in, 1518, the, chapel, was, consecrated, to, the, patron, saint, of, jesus, christ, in, the, altar, sacrament, the, holy, virgin, mary,

catholic, because, the, fugger, foundation, continued, to, look, after, it, and, contributed, to, the, upkeep, of, the, church, this, is, how, the, remarkable, fact, came, about, that, part, of, the, church, is, denominationally, different, from, the, rest, and, that, the, burial, place, of, the, fugger, family, who, are, considered, strictly, catholic, is, now, in, a, protestant, church, the, fugger, family, already, owned, two, houses, in, augsburg, in, prominent, locations, when, jakob, fugger, built, the, fuggerh, user, near, the, wine, market, now, maximilianstra, e, from, 1512, to,
