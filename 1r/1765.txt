nikolai, zinin, then, in, 1850, went, to, paris, to, further, the, work, there, he, met, ascanio, sobrero, who, had, invented, nitroglycerin, three, years, before, sobrero, strongly, opposed, the, use, of, nitroglycerin, because, it, was, unpredictable, exploding, when, subjected, to, variable, heat, or, pressure, but, nobel, became, interested, in, finding, a, way, to, control, and, use, nitroglycerin, as, a, commercially, usable, explosive, it, had, much, more, power, than, gunpowder, in, 1851, at, age, 18, he, went, to, the, united, states, for, one, year, to, study, working, for, a, short, period, under, swedish, american, inventor, john, ericsson, who, designed, the, american, civil, war, ironclad, uss, monitor, nobel, filed, his, first, patent, an, english, patent, for, a, gas, meter, in, 1857, while, his, first, swedish, patent, which, he, received, in, 1863, was, on, ways, to, prepare, gunpowder, the, family, factory, produced, armaments, for, the, crimean, war, 1853,

study, of, explosives, and, especially, to, the, safe, manufacture, and, use, of, nitroglycerin, nobel, invented, a, detonator, in, 1863, and, in, 1865, designed, the, blasting, cap, on, 3, september, 1864, a, shed, used, for, preparation, of, nitroglycerin, exploded, at, the, factory, in, heleneborg, stockholm, sweden, killing, five, people, including, nobel, s, younger, brother, emil, he, was, then, deprived, of, his, license, to, produce, explosives, fazed, by, the, accident, nobel, founded, the, company, nitroglycerin, ab, in, vinterviken, so, that, he, could, continue, to, work, in, a, more, isolated, area, nobel, invented, dynamite, in, 1867, a, substance, easier, and, safer, to, handle, than, the, more, unstable, nitroglycerin, dynamite, was, patented, in, the, us, and, the, uk, and, was, used, extensively, in, mining, and, the, building, of, transport, networks, internationally, in, 1875, nobel, invented, gelignite, more, stable, and, powerful, than, dynamite, and, in, 1887, patented, ballistite, a, predecessor, of, cordite, nobel, was, elected, a, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1884, the, same, institution, that, would, later, select, laureates, for, two, of, the, nobel, prizes, and, he, received, an, honorary, doctorate, from, uppsala, university, in, 1893, nobel, s, brothers, ludvig, and, robert, founded, the, oil, company, branobel, and, became, hugely, rich, in, their, own, right, nobel, invested, in, these, and, amassed, great, wealth, through, the, development, of, these, new, oil, regions, it, operated, mainly, in, baku, azerbaijan, but, also, in, cheleken, turkmenistan, during, his, life, nobel, was, issued, 355, patents, internationally, and, by, his, death, his, business, had, established, more, than, 90, armaments, factories, despite, his, apparently, pacifist, character, nobel, found, that, when, nitroglycerin, was, incorporated, in, an, absorbent, inert, substance, like, kieselguhr, diatomaceous, earth, it, became, safer, and, more, convenient, to, handle, and, this, mixture, he, patented, in, 1867, as, dynamite, nobel, demonstrated, his, explosive, for, the, first, time, that, year, at, a, quarry, in, redhill, surrey, england, in, order, to, help, reestablish, his, name, and, improve, the, image, of, his, business, from, the, earlier, controversies, associated, with, dangerous, explosives, nobel, had, also, considered, naming, the, highly, powerful, substance, nobel, s, safety, powder, which, is, the, text, used, in, his, patent, but, settled, with, dynamite, instead, referring, to, the, greek, word, for, power, nobel, later, combined, nitroglycerin, with, various, nitrocellulose, compounds, similar, to, collodion, but, settled, on, a, more, efficient, recipe, combining, another, nitrate, explosive, and, obtained, a, transparent, jelly, like, substance, which, was, a, more, powerful, explosive, than, dynamite, gelignite, or, blasting, gelatin, as, it, was, named, was, patented, in, 1876, and, was, followed, by, a, host, of, similar, combinations, modified, by, the, addition, of, potassium, nitrate, and, various, other, substances, gelignite, was, more, stable, powerful, transportable, and, conveniently, formed, to, fit, into, bored, holes, like, those, used, in, drilling, and, mining, than, the, previously, used, compounds, it, was, adopted, as, the, standard, technology, for, mining, in, the, age, of, engineering, bringing, nobel, a, great, amount, of, financial, success, though, at, a, cost, to, his, health, an, offshoot, of, this, research, resulted, in, nobel, s, invention, of, ballistite, the, precursor, of, many, modern, smokeless, powder, explosives, and, still, used, as, a, rocket, propellant, there, is, a, well, known, story, about, the, origin, of, the, nobel, prize, although, historians, have, been, unable, to, verify, it, and, some, dismiss, the, story, as, a, myth, in, 1888, the, death, of, his, brother, ludvig, supposedly, caused, several, newspapers, to, publish, obituaries, of, alfred, in, error, one, french, newspaper, condemned, him, for, his, invention, of, military, explosives, in, many, versions, of, the, story, dynamite, is, quoted, although, this, was, mainly, used, for, civilian, applications, and, this, is, said, to, have, brought, about, his, decision, to, leave, a, better, legacy, after, his, death, the, obituary, stated, le, marchand, de, la, mort, est, mort, the, merchant, of, death, is, dead, and, went, on, to, say, dr, alfred, nobel, who, became, rich, by, finding, ways, to, kill, more, people, faster, than, ever, before, died, yesterday, nobel, read, the, obituary, and, was, appalled, at, the, idea, that, he, would, be, remembered, in, this, way, his, decision, to, posthumously, donate, the, majority, of, his, wealth, to, found, the, nobel, prize, has, been, credited, to, him, wanting, to, leave, behind, a, better, legacy, however, it, has, been, questioned, whether, or, not, the, obituary, in, question, actually, existed, on, 27, november, 1895, at, the, swedish, norwegian, club, in, paris, nobel, signed, his, last, will, and, testament, and, set, aside, the, bulk, of, his, estate, to, establish, the, nobel, prizes, to, be, awarded, annually, without, distinction, of, nationality, after, taxes, and, bequests, to, individuals, nobel, s, will, allocated, 94, of, his, total, assets, 31, 225, 000, swedish, kronor, to, establish, the, five, nobel, prizes, by, 2022, the, foundation, had, approximately, 6, billion, swedish, kronor, of, invested, capital, the, first, three, of, these, prizes, are, awarded, for, eminence, in, physical, science, in, chemistry, and, in, medical, science, or, physiology, the, fourth, is, for, literary, work, in, an, ideal, direction, and, the, fifth, prize, is, to, be, given, to, the, person, or, society, that, renders, the, greatest, service, to, the, cause, of, international, fraternity, in, the, suppression, or, reduction, of, standing, armies, or, in, the, establishment, or, furtherance, of, peace, congresses, the, formulation, for, the, literary, prize, being, given, for, a, work, in, an, ideal, direction, i, idealisk, riktning, in, swedish, is, cryptic, and, has, caused, much, confusion, for, many, years, the, swedish, academy, interpreted, ideal, as, idealistic, idealistisk, and, used, it, as, a, reason, not, to, give, the, prize, to, important, but, less, romantic, authors, such, as, henrik, ibsen, and, leo, tolstoy, this, interpretation, has, since, been, revised, and, the, prize, has, been, awarded, to, for, example, dario, fo, and, jos, saramago, who, do, not, belong, to, the, camp, of, literary, idealism, there, was, room, for, interpretation, by, the, bodies, he, had, named, for, deciding, on, the, physical, sciences, and, chemistry, prizes, given, that, he, had, not, consulted, them, before, making, the, will, in, his, one, page, testament, he, stipulated, that, the, money, go, to, discoveries, or, inventions, in, the, physical, sciences, and, to, discoveries, or, improvements, in, chemistry, he, had, opened, the, door, to, technological, awards, but, had, not, left, instructions, on, how, to, deal, with, the, distinction, between, science, and, technology, since, the, deciding, bodies, he, had, chosen, were, more, concerned, with, the, former, the, prizes, went, to, scientists, more, often, than, engineers, technicians, or, other, inventors, sweden, s, central, bank, sveriges, riksbank, celebrated, its, 300th, anniversary, in, 1968, by, donating, a, large, sum, of, money, to, the, nobel, foundation, to, be, used, to, set, up, a, sixth, prize, in, the, field, of, economics, in, honor, of, alfred, nobel, in, 2001, alfred, nobel, s, great, great, nephew, peter, nobel, born, 1931, asked, the, bank, of, sweden, to, differentiate, its, award, to, economists, given, in, alfred, nobel, s, memory, from, the, five, other, awards, this, request, added, to, the, controversy, over, whether, the, bank, of, sweden, prize, in, economic, sciences, in, memory, of, alfred, nobel, is, actually, a, legitimate, nobel, prize, in, his, letters, to, his, mistress, hess, nobel, described, constant, pain, debilitating, migraines, and, paralyzing, fatigue, leading, some, to, believe, that, he, suffered, from, fibromyalgia, however, his, concerns, at, the, time, were, dismissed, as, hypochondria, leading, to, further, depression, by, 1895, nobel, had, developed, angina, pectoris, on, 27, november, 1895, he, finalized, his, will, and, testament, leaving, most, of, his, wealth, in, trust, unbeknownst, to, his, family, to, fund, the, nobel, prize, awards, on, 10, december, 1896, he, suffered, a, stroke, intracerebral, hemorrhage, and, was, first, partially, paralyzed, and, then, died, aged, 63, he, is, buried, in, norra, begravningsplatsen, in, stockholm, based, on, his, experimentation, with, explosives, his, strenuous, work, habit, and, the, decline, in, his, health, at, the, end, of, the, 1870s, some, hypothesize, that, nitroglycerine, poisoning, was, a, contributing, factor, to, his, death, at, a, premature, age, nobel, was, lutheran, and, during, his, years, living, in, paris, he, regularly, attended, the, church, of, sweden, abroad, led, by, pastor, nathan, s, derblom, who, received, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, 1930, he, was, an, agnostic, in, youth, and, became, an, atheist, later, in, life, though, he, still, donated, generously, to, the, church, nobel, remained, a, solitary, character, given, to, periods, of, depression, he, never, married, although, his, biographers, note, that, he, had, at, least, three, loves, his, first, love, was, in, russia, with, a, girl, named, alexandra, who, rejected, his, marriage, proposal, in, 1876, austro, bohemian, countess, bertha, von, suttner, became, his, secretary, but, she, left, him, after, a, brief, stay, to, marry, her, previous, lover, baron, arthur, gundaccar, von, suttner, her, contact, with, nobel, was, brief, yet, she, corresponded, with, him, until, his, death, in, 1896, and, probably, influenced, his, decision, to, include, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, his, will, she, was, awarded, the, 1905, nobel, peace, prize, for, her, sincere, peace, activities, nobel, s, longest, lasting, relationship, was, an, 18, year, relationship, with, sofija, hess, from, celje, whom, he, met, in, 1876, in, baden, bei, wien, where, she, worked, as, an, employee, in, a, flower, shop, that, catered, to, wealthy, clientele, the, extent, of, their, relationship, was, revealed, by, a, collection, of, 221, letters, sent, by, nobel, to, hess, over, 15, years, at, the, time, that, they, met, nobel, was, 43, years, old, while, hess, was, 26, their, relationship, which, was, not, merely, platonic, ended, when, she, became, pregnant, from, another, man, although, nobel, continued, to, support, her, financially, until, hess, married, her, child, s, father, to, avoid, being, ostracized, as, a, whore, hess, was, a, jewish, woman, who, converted, to, christianity, and, the, letters, include, remarks, by, nobel, characterized, as, antisemitism, nobel, also, displayed, characteristics, of, chauvinism, in, the, letters, writing, to, hess, you, neither, work, nor, write, nor, read, nor, think, and, guilted, her, writing, i, have, for, years, now, sacrificed, out, of, purely, noble, motives, my, time, my, duties, my, intellectual, life, my, reputation, nobel, traveled, for, much, of, his, business, life, maintaining, companies, in, europe, and, america, from, 1865, to, 1873, nobel, lived, in, kr, mmel, now, in, the, municipality, of, geesthacht, near, hamburg, from, 1873, to, 1891, he, lived, in, a, house, in, the, avenue, malakoff, in,
