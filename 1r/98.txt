of, beauty, 1753, in, it, he, professes, to, define, the, principles, of, beauty, and, grace, which, he, a, real, child, of, rococo, saw, realized, in, serpentine, lines, the, line, of, beauty, by, some, of, hogarth, s, adherents, the, book, was, praised, as, a, fine, deliverance, upon, aesthetics, by, his, enemies, and, rivals, its, obscurities, and, minor, errors, were, made, the, subject, of, endless, ridicule, and, caricature, for, instance, paul, sandby, produced, several, caricatures, against, hogarth, s, treatise, hogarth, wrote, also, a, manuscript, called, apology, for, painters, c, 1761, and, unpublished, autobiographical, notes, hogarth, lived, in, an, age, when, artwork, became, increasingly, commercialized, being, viewed, in, shop, windows, taverns, and, public, buildings, and, sold, in, printshops, old, hierarchies, broke, down, and, new, forms, began, to, flourish, the, ballad, opera, the, bourgeois, tragedy, and, especially, a, new, form, of, fiction, called, the, novel, with, which, authors, such, as, henry, fielding, had, great, success, therefore, by, that, time, hogarth, hit, on, a, new, idea, painting, and, engraving, modern, moral, subjects, to, treat, my, subjects, as, a, dramatic, writer, my, picture, was, my, stage, as, he, himself, remarked, in, his, manuscript, notes, he, drew, from, the, highly, moralizing, protestant, tradition, of, dutch, genre, painting, and, the, very, vigorous, satirical, traditions, of, the, english, broadsheet, and, other, types, of, popular, print, in, england, the, fine, arts, had, little, comedy, in, them, before, hogarth, his, prints, were, expensive, and, remained, so, until, early, 19th, century, reprints, brought, them, to, a, wider, audience, when, analysing, the, work, of, the, artist, as, a, whole, ronald, paulson, says, in, a, harlot, s, progress, every, single, plate, but, one, is, based, on, d, rer, s, images, of, the, story, of, the, virgin, and, the, story, of, the, passion, in,
