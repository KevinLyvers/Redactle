josquin, lebloitte, dit, des, prez, c, 1450, 1455, 27, august, 1521, was, a, composer, of, high, renaissance, music, who, is, variously, described, as, french, or, franco, flemish, considered, one, of, the, greatest, composers, of, the, renaissance, he, was, a, central, figure, of, the, franco, flemish, school, and, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, music, of, 16th, century, europe, building, on, the, work, of, his, predecessors, guillaume, du, fay, and, johannes, ockeghem, he, developed, a, complex, style, of, expressive, and, often, imitative, movement, between, independent, voices, polyphony, which, informs, much, of, his, work, he, further, emphasized, the, relationship, between, text, and, music, and, departed, from, the, early, renaissance, tendency, towards, lengthy, melismatic, lines, on, a, single, syllable, preferring, to, use, shorter, repeated, motifs, between, voices, josquin, was, a, singer, and, his, compositions, are, mainly, vocal, they, include, masses, motets, and, secular, chansons, josquin, s, biography, has, been, continually, revised, by, modern, scholarship, and, remains, highly, uncertain, little, is, known, of, his, early, years, he, was, born, in, the, french, speaking, area, of, flanders, and, he, may, have, been, an, altar, boy, and, have, been, educated, at, the, cambrai, cathedral, or, taught, by, ockeghem, by, 1477, he, was, in, the, choir, of, ren, of, anjou, and, then, probably, served, under, louis, xi, of, france, now, a, wealthy, man, in, the, 1480s, josquin, traveled, italy, with, the, cardinal, ascanio, sforza, may, have, worked, in, vienna, for, the, hungarian, king, matthias, corvinus, and, wrote, the, motet, ave, maria, virgo, serena, and, the, popular, chansons, adieu, mes, amours, and, que, vous, ma, dame, he, served, pope, innocent, viii, and, pope, alexander, vi, in, rome, louis, xii, in, france, and, ercole, i, d, este, in, ferrara, many, of, his, works, were, printed, and, published, by, ottaviano, petrucci, in, the, early, 16th, century, including, the, missa, hercules, dux, ferrariae, in, his, final, years, in, cond, josquin, produced, some, of, his, most, admired, works, including, the, masses, missa, de, beata, virgine, and, missa, pange, lingua, the, motets, benedicta, es, inviolata, pater, noster, ave, maria, and, praeter, rerum, seriem, and, the, chansons, mille, regretz, nimphes, napp, s, and, plus, nulz, regretz, influential, both, during, and, after, his, lifetime, josquin, has, been, described, as, the, first, western, composer, to, retain, posthumous, fame, his, music, was, widely, performed, and, imitated, in, 16th, century, europe, and, was, highly, praised, by, martin, luther, and, the, music, theorists, heinrich, glarean, and, gioseffo, zarlino, in, the, baroque, era, josquin, s, reputation, became, overshadowed, by, the, italian, composer, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, though, he, was, still, studied, by, some, theorists, and, music, historians, during, the, 20th, century, early, music, revival, publications, by, august, wilhelm, ambros, albert, smijers, helmuth, osthoff, and, edward, lowinsky, and, a, successful, academic, conference, caused, his, reevaluation, as, a, central, figure, in, renaissance, music, this, has, led, to, controversy, over, whether, he, has, been, unrealistically, elevated, over, his, contemporaries, particularly, in, light, of, over, a, hundred, attributions, now, considered, dubious, he, continues, to, draw, interest, in, the, 21st, century, and, his, music, is, frequently, recorded, central, in, the, repertoire, of, early, music, vocal, ensembles, and, the, subject, of, continuing, scholarship, he, was, celebrated, worldwide, on, the, 500th, anniversary, of, his, death, in, 2021, josquin, s, full, name, josquin, lebloitte, dit, des, prez, became, known, in, the, late, 20th, century, from, a, pair, of, 1483, documents, found, in, cond, sur, l, escaut, where, he, is, referred, to, as, the, nephew, of, gille, lebloitte, dit, des, prez, and, the, son, of, gossard, lebloitte, dit, des, prez, his, first, name, josquin, is, a, diminutive, form, of, josse, the, french, form, of, the, name, of, a, judoc, a, breton, saint, of, the, 7th, century, josquin, was, a, common, name, in, flanders, and, northern, france, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, other, documents, indicate, that, the, surname, des, prez, had, been, used, by, the, family, for, at, least, two, generations, perhaps, to, distinguish, them, from, other, branches, of, the, lebloitte, family, at, the, time, the, name, lebloitte, was, rare, and, the, reason, that, josquin, s, family, took, up, the, more, common, surname, des, prez, as, their, dit, name, remains, uncertain, his, name, has, many, spellings, in, contemporary, records, his, first, name, is, spelled, as, gosse, gossequin, jodocus, joskin, josquinus, josse, jossequin, judocus, and, juschino, and, his, surname, is, given, as, a, prato, de, prato, pratensis, de, pr, s, desprez, des, pr, s, and, des, pr, s, in, his, motet, illibata, dei, virgo, nutrix, he, includes, an, acrostic, of, his, name, where, it, is, spelled, iosqvin, des, prez, documents, from, cond, where, he, lived, for, the, last, years, of, his, life, refer, to, him, as, maistre, josse, desprez, these, include, a, letter, written, by, the, chapter, of, notre, dame, of, cond, to, margaret, of, austria, where, he, is, named, as, josquin, desprez, scholarly, opinion, differs, on, whether, his, surname, should, be, written, as, one, word, desprez, or, two, des, prez, with, publications, from, continental, europe, preferring, the, former, and, english, language, publications, the, latter, modern, scholarship, typically, refers, to, him, as, josquin, little, is, known, about, josquin, s, early, years, the, specifics, of, his, biography, have, been, debated, for, centuries, the, musicologist, william, elders, noted, that, it, could, be, called, a, twist, of, fate, that, neither, the, year, nor, the, place, of, birth, of, the, greatest, composer, of, the, renaissance, is, known, a, now, outdated, theory, is, that, he, was, born, around, 1440, based, on, a, mistaken, association, with, jushinus, de, kessalia, recorded, in, documents, as, judocus, de, picardia, a, reevaluation, of, his, later, career, name, and, family, background, has, discredited, this, claim, he, is, now, thought, to, have, been, born, around, 1450, and, at, the, latest, 1455, making, him, a, a, close, contemporary, of, loyset, comp, re, and, heinrich, isaac, and, slightly, older, than, jacob, obrecht, josquin, s, father, gossart, dit, des, prez, was, a, policeman, in, the, castellany, of, ath, who, was, accused, of, numerous, offenses, including, complaints, of, undue, force, and, disappears, from, the, records, after, 1448, nothing, is, known, of, josquin, s, mother, who, is, absent, from, surviving, documents, suggesting, that, she, was, either, not, considered, josquin, s, legitimate, mother, or, that, she, died, soon, after, or, during, his, birth, around, 1466, perhaps, on, the, death, of, his, father, josquin, was, named, by, his, uncle, and, aunt, gille, lebloitte, dit, des, prez, and, jacque, banestonne, as, their, heir, josquin, was, born, in, the, french, speaking, area, of, flanders, in, modern, day, northeastern, france, or, belgium, despite, his, association, with, cond, in, his, later, years, josquin, s, own, testimony, indicates, that, he, was, not, born, there, the, only, firm, evidence, for, his, birthplace, is, a, later, legal, document, in, which, josquin, described, being, born, beyond, noir, eauwe, meaning, black, water, this, description, has, puzzled, scholars, and, there, are, various, theories, on, which, body, of, water, is, being, referred, to, l, eau, noire, river, in, the, ardennes, has, been, proposed, and, there, was, a, village, named, prez, there, though, the, musicologist, david, fallows, contends, that, the, complications, surrounding, josquin, s, name, make, a, surname, connection, irrelevant, and, that, the, river, is, too, small, and, too, far, from, cond, to, be, a, candidate, fallows, proposes, a, birthplace, near, the, converging, escaut, and, haine, rivers, at, cond, preferring, the, latter, since, it, was, known, for, transporting, coal, perhaps, fitting, the, black, water, description, other, theories, include, a, birth, near, saint, quentin, aisne, due, to, his, early, association, with, the, collegiate, church, of, saint, quentin, or, in, the, small, village, of, beaurevoir, which, is, near, the, escaut, a, river, that, may, be, referred, to, in, an, acrostic, in, his, later, motet, illibata, dei, virgo, nutrix, there, is, no, documentary, evidence, covering, josquin, s, education, or, upbringing, fallows, associates, him, with, goseequin, de, condent, an, altar, boy, at, the, collegiate, church, of, saint, g, ry, cambrai, until, mid, 1466, other, scholars, such, as, gustave, reese, relay, a, 17th, century, account, from, cardinal, richelieu, s, friend, claude, h, mer, suggesting, that, josquin, became, a, choirboy, with, his, friend, jean, mouton, at, the, collegiate, church, of, saint, quentin, this, account, has, been, questioned, the, collegiate, chapel, there, was, an, important, center, of, royal, patronage, and, music, for, the, area, all, records, from, saint, quentin, were, destroyed, in, 1669, and, josquin, may, have, acquired, his, later, connections, with, the, french, royal, chapel, through, an, early, association, with, saint, quentin, he, may, have, studied, under, johannes, ockeghem, a, leading, composer, whom, he, greatly, admired, throughout, his, life, this, is, claimed, by, later, writers, such, as, gioseffo, zarlino, and, lodovico, zacconi, josquin, wrote, a, lamentation, on, the, death, of, ockeghem, nymphes, des, bois, there, is, no, concrete, evidence, for, this, tutorship, and, later, commentators, may, only, have, meant, that, josquin, learnt, from, the, older, composer, s, example, josquin, musically, quoted, ockeghem, several, times, most, directly, in, his, double, motet, alma, redemptoris, mater, ave, regina, caelorum, which, shares, an, opening, line, with, ockeghem, s, motet, alma, redemptoris, mater, josquin, could, have, been, associated, with, cambrai, cathedral, as, there, is, a, des, prez, among, the, cathedral, s, musicians, listed, in, omnium, bonorum, plena, a, motet, by, comp, re, the, motet, was, composed, before, 1474, and, names, many, important, musicians, of, the, time, including, antoine, busnois, johannes, tinctoris, johannes, regis, ockeghem, and, guillaume, du, fay, the, motet, may, refer, to, the, singer, pasquier, desprez, but, josquin, is, a, likelier, candidate, josquin, was, certainly, influenced, by, du, fay, s, music, the, musicologist, alejandro, planchart, suggests, that, the, impact, was, not, particularly, large, the, first, firm, record, of, josquin, s, employment, is, from, 19, april, 1477, when, he, was, a, singer, in, the, chapel, of, ren, of, anjou, in, aix, en, provence, other, evidence, may, place, him, in, aix, as, early, as, 1475, josquin, remained, there, until, at, least, 1478, after, which, his, name, disappears, from, historical, records, for, five, years, he, may, have, remained, in, ren, s, service, joining, his, other, singers, to, serve, louis, xi, who, sent, them, to, the, sainte, chapelle, of, paris, josquin, s, connection, to, louis, xi, could, be, furthered, by, his, early, motet, misericordias, domini, in, aeternum, cantabo, which, may, be, a, musical, tribute, for, the, king, since, it, ends, with, the, psalm, verse, in, te, domine, speravi, non, confundar, in, aeternum, the, line, louis, commissioned, jean, bourdichon, to, write, on, 50, scrolls, in, the, ch, teau, de, plessis, lez, tours, a, less, accepted, theory, for, josquin, s, activities, between, 1478, and, 1483, is, that, he, had, already, entered, the, household, of, his, future, employer, ascanio, sforza, in, 1480, in, that, case, josquin, would, have, been, with, ascanio, in, ferrara, and, might, have, written, his, missa, hercules, dux, ferrariae, at, this, time, for, ercole, d, este, around, this, period, the, casanatense, chansonnier, was, collected, in, ferrara, which, includes, six, chansons, by, josquin, adieu, mes, amours, en, l, ombre, d, ung, buissonet, et, trop, penser, ile, fantazies, de, joskin, que, vous, ma, dame, and, une, mousque, de, biscaye, adieu, mes, amours, and, que, vous, ma, dame, are, thought, to, have, been, particularly, popular, given, their, wide, dissemination, in, later, sources, in, february, 1483, josquin, returned, to, cond, to, claim, his, inheritance, from, his, aunt, and, uncle, who, may, have, been, killed, when, the, army, of, louis, xi, besieged, the, town, in, may, 1478, and, had, the, population, locked, and, burned, in, a, church, in, the, same, document, the, collegiate, church, of, cond, is, reported, to, have, given, vin, d, honneur, lit, wine, of, honor, to, josquin, because, as, a, musician, who, had, already, served, two, kings, he, was, now, a, distinguished, visitor, to, the, little, town, josquin, hired, at, least, 15, procurators, to, deal, with, his, inheritance, suggesting, he, was, then, wealthy, this, would, explain, how, later, in, his, life, he, was, able, to, travel, frequently, and, did, not, have, to, compose, greatly, demanded, mass, cycles, like, contemporaries, isaac, and, ludwig, senfl, a, surviving, record, indicates, that, josquin, was, in, milan, by, 15, may, 1484, perhaps, just, after, his, 1483, trip, to, cond, in, march, 1484, he, may, have, visited, rome, fallows, speculates, that, josquin, left, cond, for, italy, so, quickly, because, his, inheritance, gave, him, more, freedom, and, allowed, him, to, avoid, serving, a, king, who, he, suspected, had, caused, the, deaths, of, his, aunt, and, uncle, by, then, the, sacred, music, of, milan, cathedral, had, a, reputation, for, excellence, josquin, was, employed, by, the, house, of, sforza, and, on, 20, june, 1484, came, into, the, service, of, cardinal, ascanio, sforza, josquin, s, renown, as, a, composer, a, strong, recommendation, from, a, patron, of, fellow, musician, or, the, use, of, his, wealth, might, have, helped, him, get, this, prestigious, and, long, term, position, while, working, for, ascanio, on, 19, august, josquin, successfully, requested, a, previously, rejected, dispensation, to, be, rector, at, the, parish, church, saint, aubin, without, having, been, ordained, a, priest, joshua, rifkin, dates, the, well, known, motet, ave, maria, virgo, serena, to, this, time, c, 1485, josquin, went, to, rome, with, ascanio, in, july, 1484, for, a, year, and, may, have, gone, to, paris, for, a, litigation, suit, involving, the, benefice, in, saint, aubin, during, the, later, 1480s, around, this, time, the, poet, serafino, dell, aquila, wrote, his, sonnet, to, josquin, ad, jusquino, suo, compagno, musico, d, ascanio, to, josquin, his, fellow, musician, of, ascanio, which, asks, him, not, to, be, discouraged, if, his, genius, so, sublime, seemed, poorly, remunerated, between, 1485, and, 1489, josquin, may, have, served, under, the, hungarian, king, matthias, corvinus, in, vienna, an, account, by, the, cardinal, girolamo, aleandro, in, 1539, recalls, the, archbishop, of, esztergom, pal, varday, stating, that, the, court, of, matthias, included, excellent, painters, and, musicians, among, them, even, josquin, himself, some, scholars, suggest, aleandro, was, repeating, a, false, rumor, or, that, varday, confused, josquin, des, prez, for, josquin, dor, or, johannes, de, stokem, fallows, contends, that, it, is, unlikely, that, varday, who, was, well, educated, and, a, musician, would, have, made, such, a, mistake, but, concedes, that, it, is, possible, the, court, of, matthias, had, a, high, standard, of, music, and, employed, numerous, musicians, many, of, them, from, italy, though, fallows, asserts, that, josquin, s, presence, in, the, hungarian, king, s, service, is, likely, the, evidence, is, circumstantial, and, no, original, documents, survive, to, confirm, the, claim, josquin, was, in, milan, again, in, january, 1489, probably, until, early, may, and, met, the, theorist, and, composer, franchinus, gaffurius, there, from, june, 1489, until, at, least, april, 1494, josquin, was, a, member, of, the, papal, choir, in, rome, under, pope, innocent, viii, then, the, borgia, pope, alexander, vi, josquin, may, have, arrived, there, due, to, an, exchange, of, singers, between, ludovico, sforza, and, pope, innocent, where, the, latter, sent, gaspar, van, weerbeke, to, milan, presumably, in, return, for, josquin, josquin, s, arrival, brought, much, needed, prestige, to, the, choir, as, the, composers, gaspar, and, stokem, had, left, recently, and, the, only, other, choristers, known, to, be, composers, were, marbrianus, de, orto, and, bertrandus, vaqueras, two, months, after, his, arrival, josquin, laid, claim, to, the, first, of, various, benefices, on, 18, august, holding, three, unrelated, benefices, at, once, without, having, residency, there, or, needing, to, speak, that, area, s, language, was, a, special, privilege, that, josquin, s, tenure, and, position, offered, many, of, his, choir, colleagues, had, also, enjoyed, such, privileges, his, claims, included, a, canonry, at, the, notre, dame, de, paris, saint, omer, cambrai, a, parish, in, the, gift, of, saint, ghislain, abbey, the, basse, yttre, parish, church, two, parishes, near, frasnes, hainaut, and, saint, g, ry, cambrai, surviving, papal, letters, indicate, that, some, of, these, claims, were, approved, but, he, does, not, appear, to, have, taken, up, any, of, the, canonries, the, sistine, chapel, s, monthly, payment, records, give, the, best, record, of, josquin, s, career, but, all, papal, chapel, records, from, april, 1494, to, november, 1500, are, lost, making, it, unknown, when, he, left, rome, after, restorations, from, 1997, to, 1998, the, name, josquinj, was, found, as, a, graffito, on, the, wall, of, the, sistine, chapel, s, cantoria, choir, gallery, it, is, one, of, almost, four, hundred, names, inscribed, in, the, chapel, around, a, hundred, of, which, can, be, identified, with, singers, of, the, papal, choir, they, date, from, the, 15th, to, 18th, centuries, and, the, josquinj, signature, is, in, the, style, of, the, former, there, is, some, evidence, suggesting, the, name, refers, to, josquin, des, prez, it, may, be, interpreted, as, either, josquin, or, josquinus, depending, on, whether, the, curved, line, on, the, far, right, is, read, as, the, abbreviation, for, us, other, choristers, named, josquin, tended, to, sign, their, name, in, full, whereas, josquin, des, prez, is, known, to, have, done, so, mononymously, on, occasion, andrea, adami, da, bolsena, notes, in, his, 1711, osservazioni, per, ben, regolare, il, coro, dei, cantori, della, cappella, pontificia, that, in, his, time, josquin, s, name, was, visibly, sculpted, in, the, sistine, chapel, s, choir, room, the, musicologist, richard, sherr, writes, that, while, this, is, not, a, true, autograph, signature, the, possibility, that, josquin, des, prez, actually, produced, it, during, his, stay, in, the, papal, chapel, is, very, high, and, fallows, says, that, it, hardly, counts, as, an, autograph, but, it, may, be, the, closest, we, can, get, documents, found, since, the, late, 20th, century, have, shed, some, light, on, josquin, s, life, and, works, between, 1494, and, 1503, at, some, point, he, was, ordained, a, priest, in, august, 1494, he, went, to, cambrai, as, attested, by, a, vin, d, honneur, lit, wine, of, honor, record, and, he, may, have, returned, to, rome, soon, after, from, then, to, 1498, there, is, no, firm, evidence, for, his, activities, fallows, suggests, he, stayed, in, cambrai, for, these, four, years, citing, johannes, manlius, s, 1562, book, locorum, communium, collectanea, which, associates, josquin, with, cambrai, s, musical, establishment, this, assertion, would, fit, with, josquin, s, possible, youthful, connections, in, cambrai, and, later, vin, d, honneur, there, manlius, cites, the, reformer, philip, melanchthon, as, the, source, for, many, of, his, stories, strengthening, the, authenticity, of, his, josquin, anecdotes, melanchthon, was, close, to, musical, figures, of, his, time, including, the, publisher, georg, rhau, and, the, composer, adrianus, petit, coclico, two, letters, between, members, of, the, house, of, gonzaga, and, ascanio, sforza, suggest, that, josquin, may, have, re, entered, the, service, of, the, sforza, family, in, milan, around, 1498, they, refer, to, a, servant, juschino, who, delivered, the, hunting, dogs, to, the, gonzagas, circumstantial, evidence, suggests, juschino, may, have, been, josquin, des, prez, but, he, is, not, known, to, have, been, qualified, for, such, a, task, and, it, would, be, unusual, to, refer, to, him, as, a, servant, rather, than, a, musician, or, singer, josquin, probably, did, not, stay, in, milan, long, since, his, former, employers, were, captured, during, louis, xii, s, 1499, invasion, before, he, left, he, most, likely, wrote, two, secular, compositions, the, well, known, frottola, el, grillo, the, cricket, and, in, te, domine, speravi, i, have, placed, my, hope, in, you, lord, based, on, psalm, 31, the, latter, might, be, a, veiled, reference, to, the, religious, reformer, girolamo, savonarola, who, had, been, burned, at, the, stake, in, florence, in, 1498, and, for, whom, josquin, seems, to, have, had, a, special, reverence, the, text, was, savonarola, s, favorite, psalm, a, meditation, on, which, he, left, unfinished, in, prison, when, he, was, executed, josquin, was, probably, in, france, during, the, early, 16th, century, documents, found, in, 2008, indicate, that, he, visited, troyes, twice, between, 1499, and, 1501, the, long, doubted, account, from, h, mer, that, josquin, had, a, canonry, at, saint, quentin, was, confirmed, by, documentary, evidence, that, he, had, exchanged, it, by, 30, may, 1503, canonries, at, saint, quentin, were, almost, always, gifts, from, the, french, king, to, royal, household, members, suggesting, josquin, had, been, employed, by, louis, xii, according, to, glarean, in, the, dodecachordon, of, 1547, the, motet, memor, esto, verbi, tui, servo, tuo, remember, thy, promise, unto, thy, servant, was, composed, as, a, gentle, reminder, to, the, king, to, keep, his, promise, of, a, benefice, to, josquin, glarean, claimed, that, on, receiving, the, benefice, josquin, wrote, a, motet, on, the, text, bonitatem, fecisti, cum, servo, tuo, domine, lord, thou, hast, dealt, graciously, with, thy, servant, to, show, his, gratitude, to, the, king, either, louis, xi, or, louis, xii, although, such, a, motet, survives, and, is, mentioned, with, josquin, s, memor, esto, in, many, sources, bonitatem, fecisti, is, now, attributed, to, carpentras, some, of, josquin, s, other, compositions, have, been, tentatively, dated, to, his, french, period, such, as, vive, le, roy, and, in, exitu, israel, which, resembles, the, style, of, other, composers, of, the, french, court, the, five, voice, de, profundis, a, setting, of, psalm, 130, seems, to, have, been, written, for, a, royal, funeral, perhaps, that, of, louis, xii, anne, of, brittany, or, philip, i, of, castile, josquin, arrived, in, ferrara, by, 30, may, 1503, to, serve, ercole, i, d, este, duke, of, ferrara, an, arts, patron, who, had, been, trying, for, many, years, to, replace, the, composer, and, choirmaster, johannes, martini, who, had, recently, died, no, extant, documents, record, josquin, as, having, worked, in, ferrara, before, though, his, earlier, associations, with, ercole, suggest, prior, employment, there, he, signed, a, deed, indicating, he, did, not, intend, to, stay, there, for, long, ercole, is, known, to, have, met, with, josquin, s, former, employer, louis, xii, throughout, 1499, to, 1502, and, these, meetings, may, have, led, to, his, service, for, the, duke, two, letters, survive, explaining, the, circumstances, of, his, arrival, both, from, courtiers, who, scouted, musical, talent, in, the, service, of, ercole, the, first, of, these, was, from, girolamo, da, sestola, nicknamed, coglia, to, ercole, explaining, my, lord, i, believe, that, there, is, neither, lord, nor, king, who, will, now, have, a, better, chapel, than, yours, if, your, lordship, sends, for, josquin, and, by, having, josquin, in, our, chapel, i, want, to, place, a, crown, upon, this, chapel, of, ours, 14, august, 1502, the, second, letter, from, the, courtier, gian, de, artiganova, criticized, josquin, and, suggested, heinrich, isaac, instead, to, me, seems, well, suited, to, serve, your, lordship, more, so, than, josquin, because, he, is, more, good, natured, and, companionable, and, will, compose, new, works, more, often, it, is, true, that, josquin, composes, better, but, he, composes, when, he, wants, to, and, not, when, one, wants, him, to, and, he, is, asking, 200, ducats, in, salary, while, isaac, will, come, for, 120, but, your, lordship, will, decide, around, three, months, later, josquin, was, chosen, his, salary, of, 200, ducats, was, the, highest, ever, for, a, ducal, chapel, member, the, artiganova, letter, is, a, unique, source, for, josquin, s, personality, and, the, musicologist, patrick, macey, interprets, it, as, meaning, he, was, a, difficult, colleague, and, that, he, took, an, independent, attitude, towards, producing, music, for, his, patrons, edward, lowinsky, connected, his, purportedly, difficult, behavior, with, musical, talent, and, used, the, letter, as, evidence, that, josquin, s, contemporaries, recognized, his, genius, musicologist, rob, wegman, questions, whether, meaningful, conclusions, can, be, drawn, from, such, an, anecdote, in, a, later, publication, wegman, notes, the, largely, unprecedented, nature, of, such, a, position, and, warns, yet, of, course, the, letter, could, equally, well, be, seen, to, reflect, the, attitudes, and, expectations, of, its, recipient, ercole, d, este, while, in, ferrara, josquin, wrote, some, of, his, most, famous, compositions, including, the, austere, savonarola, influenced, miserere, mei, deus, which, became, one, of, the, most, widely, distributed, motets, of, the, 16th, century, also, probably, from, this, period, was, the, virtuoso, motet, virgo, salutiferi, set, to, a, poem, by, ercole, strozzi, and, o, virgo, prudentissima, based, on, a, poem, by, poliziano, due, to, its, stylistic, resemblance, to, miserere, and, virgo, salutiferi, the, missa, hercules, dux, ferrariae, is, also, attributed, to, this, time, it, was, previously, thought, to, have, been, written, in, the, early, 1480s, josquin, did, not, stay, in, ferrara, long, an, outbreak, of, the, plague, in, 1503, prompted, the, evacuation, of, the, duke, and, his, family, as, well, as, two, thirds, of, the, citizens, and, josquin, left, by, april, 1504, his, replacement, obrecht, died, of, the, plague, in, mid, 1505, josquin, probably, moved, from, ferrara, to, his, home, region, of, cond, sur, l, escaut, and, became, provost, of, the, collegiate, church, of, notre, dame, on, 3, may, 1504, he, may, have, obtained, the, post, from, philip, i, s, sponsorship, his, role, gave, him, political, responsibility, and, put, him, in, charge, of, a, workforce, which, included, a, dean, a, treasurer, 25, canons, 18, chaplains, 16, vicars, 6, choir, boys, and, other, priests, this, was, an, appealing, place, for, his, old, age, it, was, near, his, birthplace, had, a, renowned, choir, and, was, the, leading, musical, establishment, in, hainaut, besides, st, vincent, at, soignies, and, cambrai, cathedral, very, few, records, of, his, activity, survive, from, this, time, he, bought, a, house, in, september, 1504, and, sold, it, or, a, different, one, in, november, 1508, the, josquin, mentioned, may, be, the, joskin, who, traveled, to, present, chansons, to, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, in, brussels, or, mechelen, in, his, later, years, josquin, composed, many, of, his, most, admired, works, they, include, the, masses, missa, de, beata, virgine, and, missa, pange, lingua, the, motets, benedicta, es, inviolata, pater, noster, ave, maria, and, praeter, rerum, seriem, and, the, chansons, mille, regretz, nimphes, napp, s, and, plus, nulz, regretz, the, last, of, these, plus, nulz, regretz, is, set, to, a, poem, by, jean, lemaire, de, belges, that, celebrates, the, future, engagement, between, charles, v, and, mary, tudor, in, his, last, years, josquin, s, music, saw, european, wide, dissemination, through, publications, by, the, printer, ottaviano, petrucci, josquin, s, compositions, were, given, a, prominent, place, by, petrucci, and, were, reissued, numerous, times, on, his, deathbed, josquin, left, an, endowment, for, the, performance, of, his, work, pater, noster, at, all, general, processions, when, townsfolk, passed, his, house, stopping, to, place, a, wafer, on, the, marketplace, altar, to, the, holy, virgin, he, died, on, 27, august, 1521, and, left, his, possessions, to, cond, s, chapter, of, notre, dame, he, was, buried, in, front, of, the, church, s, high, altar, but, his, tomb, was, destroyed, either, during, the, french, wars, of, religion, 1562, 1598, or, in, 1793, when, the, church, was, demolished, amid, the, french, revolution, after, du, fay, died, in, 1474, josquin, and, his, contemporaries, lived, in, a, musical, world, of, frequent, stylistic, change, in, part, due, to, the, movement, of, musicians, between, different, regions, of, europe, a, line, of, musicologists, credits, josquin, with, three, primary, developments, 1, the, gradual, departure, from, extensive, melismatic, lines, and, emphasis, instead, on, smaller, motifs, these, motivic, cells, were, short, easily, recognizable, melodic, fragments, which, passed, from, one, voice, to, another, in, a, contrapuntal, texture, giving, it, an, inner, unity, 2, the, prominent, use, of, imitative, polyphony, equally, between, voices, which, combines, a, rational, and, homogeneous, integration, of, the, musical, space, with, a, self, renewing, rhythmic, impetus, 3, a, focus, on, the, text, with, the, music, serving, to, emphasize, its, meaning, an, early, form, of, word, painting, the, musicologist, jeremy, noble, concludes, that, these, innovations, demonstrate, the, transition, from, the, earlier, music, of, du, fay, and, ockeghem, to, josquin, s, successors, adrian, willaert, and, jacques, arcadelt, and, eventually, to, the, late, renaissance, composers, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, and, orlande, de, lassus, josquin, was, a, professional, singer, throughout, his, life, and, his, compositions, are, almost, exclusively, vocal, he, wrote, in, primarily, three, genres, the, mass, motet, and, chanson, with, french, text, in, his, 50, year, career, josquin, s, body, of, work, is, larger, than, that, of, any, other, composer, of, his, period, besides, perhaps, isaac, and, obrecht, establishing, a, chronology, of, his, compositions, is, difficult, the, sources, in, which, they, were, published, offer, little, evidence, and, historical, and, contextual, connections, are, meager, few, manuscripts, of, josquin, s, music, date, from, before, the, 16th, century, due, to, according, to, noble, time, war, and, enthusiasm, both, religious, and, anti, religious, identifying, earlier, works, is, particularly, difficult, and, later, works, only, occasionally, offer, any, more, certainty, the, musicologist, richard, taruskin, writes, that, modern, scholarship, is, still, nowhere, near, a, wholly, reliable, chronology, and, unlikely, ever, to, reach, it, and, suggests, that, the, current, tentative, models, tell, us, more, about, ourselves, and, the, way, in, which, we, come, to, know, what, we, know, than, they, do, about, josquin, the, mass, is, the, central, rite, of, the, catholic, church, and, polyphonic, settings, of, the, ordinary, of, the, mass, the, kyrie, gloria, credo, sanctus, and, agnus, dei, increased, in, popularity, in, the, 14th, century, from, the, 15th, century, composers, treated, it, as, a, central, genre, in, western, classical, music, in, accordance, with, greater, demand, by, josquin, s, time, masses, were, generally, standardized, into, substantial, polyphonic, five, movement, works, making, it, difficult, for, composers, to, satisfy, both, liturgical, and, musical, demands, previous, examples, in, the, genre, by, composers, such, as, du, fay, and, ockeghem, were, widely, admired, and, emulated, josquin, and, obrecht, led, an, intensive, development, of, the, genre, josquin, s, masses, are, generally, less, progressive, than, his, motets, though, he, is, credited, with, numerous, innovations, in, the, genre, his, less, radical, approach, may, be, explained, by, most, of, the, masses, being, earlier, works, or, the, structural, and, textual, limitations, of, the, genre, almost, all, are, for, four, voices, the, josquin, companion, categorizes, the, composer, s, masses, into, the, following, styles, josquin, began, his, career, at, a, time, when, composers, started, to, find, strict, cantus, firmus, masses, limiting, he, pioneered, paraphrase, and, parody, masses, which, were, not, well, established, before, the, 16th, century, many, of, his, works, combine, the, cantus, firmus, style, with, paraphrase, and, parody, making, strict, categorization, problematic, reflecting, on, josquin, s, masses, noble, notes, that, in, general, his, instinct, at, least, in, his, mature, works, seems, to, be, to, extract, as, much, variety, as, possible, from, his, given, musical, material, sacred, or, secular, by, any, appropriate, means, josquin, s, predecessors, and, contemporaries, wrote, masses, based, on, canonic, imitation, the, canonic, voices, in, these, masses, derive, from, pre, existing, melodies, such, as, the, l, homme, arm, song, faugues, comp, re, and, forestier, or, chant, fevin, and, la, rue, s, missae, de, feria, josquin, s, two, canonic, masses, are, not, based, on, existing, tunes, and, so, stand, apart, from, the, mainstream, they, are, closer, to, the, missa, prolationum, written, by, ockeghem, and, missa, ad, fugam, by, de, orto, both, of, which, use, original, melodies, in, all, the, voices, josquin, s, two, canonic, masses, were, published, in, petrucci, s, third, book, of, josquin, masses, in, 1514, the, missa, ad, fugam, is, the, earlier, of, the, two, it, has, a, head, motif, consisting, of, the, whole, first, kyrie, which, is, repeated, in, the, beginning, of, all, five, movements, the, canon, is, restricted, to, the, highest, voice, and, the, pitch, interval, between, the, voices, is, fixed, while, the, temporal, interval, varies, between, only, two, values, the, two, free, voices, generally, do, not, participate, in, the, imitation, the, precise, relationship, of, josquin, s, mass, to, de, orto, s, is, uncertain, as, is, josquin, s, authorship, of, the, mass, no, questions, of, authenticity, cloud, the, missa, sine, nomine, written, during, josquin, s, final, years, in, cond, in, contrast, to, the, inflexibility, of, the, canonic, scheme, in, the, missa, ad, fugam, the, temporal, and, pitch, interval, of, the, canon, along, with, the, voices, that, participate, in, it, are, varied, throughout, the, free, voices, are, more, fully, integrated, into, the, texture, and, frequently, participate, in, imitation, with, the, canonic, voices, sometimes, preemptively, prior, to, josquin, s, mature, period, the, most, common, technique, for, writing, masses, was, the, cantus, firmus, a, technique, which, had, been, in, use, for, most, of, the, 15th, century, josquin, used, the, technique, early, in, his, career, with, the, missa, l, ami, baudichon, considered, to, be, one, of, his, earliest, masses, this, mass, is, based, on, a, secular, tune, similar, to, three, blind, mice, basing, a, mass, on, such, a, source, was, an, accepted, procedure, as, evidenced, by, the, existence, of, the, mass, in, sistine, chapel, part, books, copied, during, the, papacy, of, julius, ii, 1503, 1513, josquin, s, most, famous, cantus, firmus, masses, are, the, two, based, on, the, l, homme, arm, lit, the, armed, man, a, popular, tune, for, mass, composition, throughout, the, renaissance, though, both, are, relatively, mature, compositions, they, are, very, different, missa, l, homme, arm, super, voces, musicales, is, a, technical, tour, de, force, on, the, tune, containing, numerous, mensuration, canons, and, contrapuntal, display, throughout, the, work, the, melody, is, presented, on, each, note, of, the, natural, hexachord, c, d, e, f, g, and, a, the, later, missa, l, homme, arm, sexti, toni, is, a, fantasia, on, the, theme, of, the, armed, man, while, based, on, a, cantus, firmus, it, is, also, a, paraphrase, mass, for, fragments, of, the, tune, appear, in, all, voices, throughout, the, work, the, melody, appears, in, a, wide, variety, of, tempos, and, rhythms, technically, it, is, almost, restrained, compared, to, the, other, l, homme, arm, mass, until, the, closing, agnus, dei, which, contains, a, complex, canonic, structure, including, a, rare, retrograde, canon, around, which, other, voices, are, woven, paraphrase, masses, by, josquin, the, paraphrase, mass, differed, from, the, cantus, firmus, technique, in, that, the, source, material, though, still, monophonic, could, be, by, josquin, s, time, highly, embellished, often, with, ornaments, as, in, the, cantus, firmus, technique, the, source, tune, may, appear, in, many, voices, of, the, mass, several, of, josquin, s, masses, feature, the, paraphrase, technique, such, as, the, early, missa, gaudeamus, which, also, includes, cantus, firmus, and, canonic, elements, the, missa, ave, maris, stella, also, probably, an, early, work, paraphrases, the, marian, antiphon, of, the, same, name, it, is, one, of, his, shortest, masses, the, late, missa, de, beata, virgine, paraphrases, plainchants, in, praise, of, the, virgin, mary, as, a, lady, mass, it, is, a, votive, mass, for, saturday, performance, and, was, his, most, popular, mass, in, the, 16th, century, the, best, known, of, josquin, s, paraphrase, masses, and, one, of, the, most, famous, mass, settings, of, the, renaissance, is, the, missa, pange, lingua, based, on, a, hymn, by, thomas, aquinas, for, the, vespers, of, corpus, christi, it, was, probably, the, last, mass, josquin, composed, this, mass, is, an, extended, fantasia, on, the, tune, using, the, melody, in, all, voices, and, all, parts, of, the, mass, in, elaborate, and, ever, changing, polyphony, one, of, the, high, points, of, the, mass, is, the, et, incarnatus, est, section, of, the, credo, where, the, texture, becomes, homophonic, and, the, tune, appears, in, the, topmost, voice, here, the, portion, which, would, normally, set, sing, o, my, tongue, of, the, mystery, of, the, divine, body, is, instead, given, the, words, and, he, became, incarnate, by, the, holy, ghost, from, the, virgin, mary, and, was, made, man, noble, comments, that, the, vigour, of, the, earlier, masses, can, still, be, felt, in, the, rhythms, and, the, strong, drive, to, cadences, perhaps, more, so, than, in, the, missa, de, beata, virgine, but, essentially, the, two, contrasting, strains, of, josquin, s, music, fantasy, and, intellectual, control, are, so, blended, and, balanced, in, these, two, works, that, one, can, see, in, them, the, beginnings, of, a, new, style, one, which, reconciles, the, conflicting, aims, of, the, great, 15th, century, composers, in, a, new, synthesis, that, was, in, essence, to, remain, valid, for, the, whole, of, the, 16th, century, parody, masses, by, josquin, du, fay, was, one, of, the, first, to, write, masses, based, on, secular, songs, a, parody, mass, and, his, missa, se, la, face, ay, pale, dates, to, the, decade, of, josquin, s, birth, by, the, turn, of, the, 16th, century, composers, were, moving, from, quoting, single, voice, lines, to, widen, their, reference, to, all, voices, in, the, piece, this, was, part, of, the, transition, from, the, medieval, cantus, firmus, mass, where, the, voice, bearing, the, preexisting, melody, stood, aloof, from, the, others, to, the, renaissance, parody, masses, where, all, the, voices, formed, an, integrated, texture, in, such, masses, the, source, material, was, not, a, single, line, but, motifs, and, points, of, imitation, from, all, voices, within, a, polyphonic, work, by, the, time, josquin, died, these, parody, masses, had, become, well, established, and, josquin, s, works, demonstrate, the, variety, of, methods, in, musical, borrowing, during, this, transition, period, six, works, are, generally, attributed, to, josquin, which, borrow, from, polyphonic, pieces, two, of, which, also, include, canonic, features, one, of, these, the, missa, di, dadi, which, includes, a, canon, in, the, benedictus, is, based, on, a, chanson, by, robert, morton, and, has, the, rhythmic, augmentation, of, the, borrowed, tenor, part, indicated, by, dice, faces, which, are, printed, next, to, the, staff, canon, can, also, be, found, in, the, osanna, of, the, missa, faisant, regretz, which, is, based, on, walter, frye, s, tout, a, par, moy, the, missa, fortuna, desperata, is, based, on, the, popular, three, voice, italian, song, fortuna, desperata, in, this, mass, josquin, used, each, of, the, italian, song, s, voices, as, cantus, firmi, varying, throughout, the, work, a, similar, variation, in, the, source, material, s, voices, is, used, in, the, missa, malheur, me, bat, based, on, a, chanson, variously, attributed, to, martini, or, abertijne, malcourt, the, dating, of, missa, malheur, me, bat, remains, controversial, with, some, scholars, calling, it, an, early, composition, and, others, a, later, one, the, missa, mater, patris, based, on, a, three, voice, motet, by, antoine, brumel, is, probably, the, earliest, true, parody, mass, by, any, composer, as, it, no, longer, contains, any, hint, of, a, cantus, firmus, missa, d, ung, aultre, amer, is, based, on, a, popular, chanson, of, the, same, name, by, ockeghem, and, is, one, of, josquin, s, shortest, masses, a, solmization, mass, is, a, polyphonic, mass, which, uses, notes, drawn, from, a, word, or, phrase, the, style, is, first, described, by, zarlino, in, 1558, who, called, it, soggetto, cavato, from, soggetto, cavato, dalle, parole, meaning, carved, out, of, the, words, the, earliest, known, mass, by, any, composer, using, solmization, syllables, is, the, missa, hercules, dux, ferrariae, which, josquin, wrote, for, ercole, i, it, is, based, on, a, cantus, firmus, of, musical, syllables, of, the, duke, s, name, ercole, duke, of, ferrara, which, in, latin, is, h, e, rc, u, l, e, s, d, u, x, f, e, rr, a, r, ie, taking, the, solmization, syllables, with, the, same, vowels, gives, re, ut, re, ut, re, fa, mi, re, which, is, d, c, d, c, d, f, e, d, in, modern, nomenclature, the, missa, hercules, dux, ferrariae, remains, the, best, known, work, to, use, this, device, and, was, published, by, petrucci, in, 1505, relatively, soon, after, its, composition, taruskin, notes, that, the, use, of, ercole, s, name, is, josquin, s, method, of, memorialization, for, his, patron, akin, to, a, portrait, painting, the, other, josquin, mass, to, prominently, use, this, technique, is, the, missa, la, sol, fa, re, mi, based, on, the, musical, syllables, contained, in, laisse, faire, moy, let, me, take, care, of, it, essentially, the, entire, mass, s, content, is, related, to, this, phrase, and, the, piece, is, thus, something, of, an, ostinato, the, traditional, story, as, told, by, glarean, in, 1547, was, that, an, unknown, aristocrat, used, to, order, suitors, away, with, this, phrase, and, josquin, immediately, wrote, an, exceedingly, elegant, mass, on, it, as, a, jab, at, him, scholars, have, proposed, different, origins, for, the, piece, lowinsky, has, connected, it, to, the, court, of, ascanio, sforza, and, the, art, historian, dawson, kiang, connected, it, to, the, turkish, prince, cem, sultan, s, promise, to, the, pope, to, overthrow, his, brother, bayezid, ii, josquin, s, motets, are, his, most, celebrated, and, influential, works, their, style, varies, considerably, but, can, generally, be, divided, into, homophonic, settings, with, block, chords, and, syllabic, text, declamation, ornate, and, often, imitative, contrapuntal, fantasias, in, which, the, text, is, overshadowed, by, music, and, psalm, settings, which, combined, these, extremes, with, the, addition, of, rhetorical, figures, and, text, painting, that, foreshadowed, the, later, development, of, the, madrigal, he, wrote, most, of, them, for, four, voices, which, had, become, the, compositional, norm, by, the, mid, 15th, century, and, descended, from, the, four, part, writing, of, guillaume, de, machaut, and, john, dunstaple, in, the, late, middle, ages, josquin, was, also, a, considerable, innovator, in, writing, motets, for, five, and, six, voices, many, of, the, motets, use, compositional, constraint, on, the, process, others, are, freely, composed, some, use, a, cantus, firmus, as, a, unifying, device, some, are, canonic, others, use, a, motto, which, repeats, throughout, and, some, use, several, of, these, methods, in, some, motets, which, use, canon, it, is, designed, to, be, heard, and, appreciated, as, such, in, others, a, canon, is, present, but, difficult, to, hear, josquin, frequently, used, imitation, in, writing, his, motets, with, sections, akin, to, fugal, expositions, occurring, on, successive, lines, of, the, text, he, was, setting, this, is, prominent, in, his, motet, ave, maria, virgo, serena, an, early, work, where, each, voice, enters, by, restating, the, line, sung, before, it, other, early, works, such, as, a, alma, redemptoris, mater, ave, regina, caelorum, show, prominent, imitation, as, do, later, ones, such, as, his, setting, of, dominus, regnavit, psalm, 93, for, four, voices, josquin, favored, the, technique, throughout, his, career, few, composers, before, josquin, had, written, polyphonic, psalm, settings, and, these, form, a, large, proportion, of, his, later, motets, josquin, s, settings, include, the, famous, miserere, psalm, 51, memor, esto, verbi, tui, based, on, psalm, 119, and, two, settings, of, de, profundis, psalm, 130, which, are, often, considered, to, be, among, his, most, significant, accomplishments, josquin, wrote, several, examples, of, a, new, type, of, piece, developed, in, milan, the, motet, chanson, though, similar, to, 15th, century, works, based, on, the, formes, fixes, mold, which, were, completely, secular, josquin, s, motet, chansons, contained, a, chant, derived, latin, cantus, firmus, in, the, lowest, of, the, three, voices, the, other, voices, sang, a, secular, french, text, which, had, either, a, symbolic, relationship, to, the, sacred, latin, text, or, commented, on, it, josquin, s, three, known, motet, chansons, are, que, vous, madame, in, pace, a, la, mort, monstra, te, esse, matrem, and, fortune, destrange, plummaige, pauper, sum, ego, josquin, left, numerous, french, chansons, for, three, to, six, voices, some, of, which, were, probably, intended, for, instrumental, performance, as, well, in, his, chansons, he, often, used, a, cantus, firmus, sometimes, a, popular, song, whose, origin, can, no, longer, be, traced, as, in, si, j, avoye, marion, in, other, works, he, used, a, tune, originally, associated, with, a, separate, text, or, freely, composed, an, entire, song, using, no, apparent, external, source, material, another, technique, josquin, used, was, to, take, a, popular, song, and, write, it, as, a, canon, with, itself, in, two, inner, voices, and, write, new, melodic, material, above, and, around, it, to, a, new, text, he, did, this, in, one, of, his, most, famous, chansons, faulte, d, argent, josquin, s, earliest, chansons, were, probably, composed, in, northern, europe, under, the, influence, of, composers, such, as, ockeghem, and, busnois, unlike, them, he, never, adhered, strictly, to, the, conventions, of, the, formes, fixes, the, rigid, and, complex, repetition, patterns, of, the, rondeau, virelai, and, ballade, instead, he, often, wrote, his, early, chansons, in, strict, imitation, as, with, many, of, his, sacred, works, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, write, chansons, with, all, voices, equal, parts, of, the, texture, and, many, contain, points, of, imitation, similar, to, his, motets, he, also, used, melodic, repetition, especially, where, the, lines, of, text, rhymed, and, many, of, his, chansons, had, a, lighter, texture, and, faster, tempo, than, his, motets, some, of, his, chansons, were, almost, certainly, designed, to, be, performed, with, instruments, petrucci, published, many, of, them, without, text, and, some, of, the, pieces, for, example, the, fanfare, like, vive, le, roy, contain, writing, more, idiomatic, for, instruments, than, voices, josquin, s, most, famous, chansons, circulated, widely, in, europe, some, of, the, better, known, include, his, lament, on, the, death, of, ockeghem, nymphes, des, bois, requiem, aeternam, mille, regretz, an, uncertain, attribution, to, josquin, nimphes, napp, s, and, plus, nulz, regretz, josquin, also, wrote, at, least, three, pieces, in, the, manner, of, the, frottola, a, popular, italian, song, form, which, he, would, have, heard, during, his, years, in, milan, these, songs, include, scaramella, el, grillo, and, in, te, domine, speravi, they, are, even, simpler, in, texture, than, his, french, chansons, being, almost, uniformly, syllabic, and, homophonic, and, they, remain, among, his, most, frequently, performed, pieces, a, small, woodcut, portraying, josquin, is, the, most, reproduced, image, of, any, renaissance, composer, printed, in, petrus, opmeer, s, 1611, opus, chronographicum, orbis, universi, the, woodcut, is, the, earliest, known, depiction, of, josquin, and, presumably, based, on, an, oil, painting, which, opmeer, says, was, kept, in, the, collegiate, church, of, st, goedele, church, documents, discovered, in, the, 1990s, have, corroborated, opmeer, s, statement, about, the, painting, s, existence, it, may, have, been, painted, during, josquin, s, lifetime, and, was, owned, by, petrus, jacobi, d, 1568, a, cantor, and, organist, at, st, gudula, brussels, following, the, will, s, instructions, the, altarpiece, was, placed, next, to, jacobi, s, tomb, but, it, was, destroyed, in, the, late, 16th, century, by, protestant, iconoclasts, whether, the, woodcut, is, a, realistic, likeness, of, the, oil, painting, remains, uncertain, elders, notes, that, comparisons, between, contemporaneous, woodcuts, based, on, original, paintings, that, do, survive, often, show, incompetent, realizations, putting, the, accuracy, of, the, woodcut, in, question, the, portrait, of, a, musician, widely, attributed, to, leonardo, da, vinci, depicts, a, man, holding, sheet, music, which, has, led, many, scholars, to, identify, him, as, a, musician, the, work, is, usually, dated, to, the, mid, 1480s, and, numerous, candidates, have, been, proposed, including, franchinus, gaffurius, and, atalante, migliorotti, though, none, have, achieved, wide, approval, in, 1972, the, belgian, musicologist, suzanne, clercx, lejeune, argued, the, subject, is, josquin, she, interpreted, the, words, on, the, sitter, s, sheet, music, as, cont, an, abbreviation, of, contratenor, cantuz, cantus, and, a, z, an, abbreviation, of, altuz, and, she, identified, the, music, as, josquin, s, llibata, dei, virgo, nutrix, several, factors, make, this, unlikely, the, painting, does, not, resemble, the, opmeer, portrait, the, notation, is, largely, illegible, and, as, a, priest, in, his, mid, thirties, josquin, does, not, seem, like, the, younger, layperson, in, the, portrait, fallows, disagrees, noting, that, a, lot, of, new, details, point, to, josquin, who, was, the, right, age, in, the, right, place, had, already, served, at, least, two, kings, and, was, now, rich, enough, to, have, his, portrait, painted, by, the, best, but, concludes, that, we, shall, probably, never, know, who, leonardo, s, musician, was, a, portrait, from, the, early, 16th, century, kept, in, the, galleria, nazionale, di, parma, is, often, related, to, josquin, it, is, usually, attributed, to, filippo, mazzola, and, is, thought, to, depict, the, italian, music, theorist, nicol, burzio, though, neither, the, attribution, nor, sitter, are, certain, the, man, in, the, painting, is, holding, an, altered, version, of, josquin, s, canon, guillaume, se, va, chauffer, fallows, notes, that, the, subject, has, similar, facial, features, to, the, portrait, printed, by, opmeer, but, concludes, that, there, is, not, enough, evidence, to, conclude, josquin, is, the, sitter, clercx, lejeune, also, suggested, josquin, was, depicted, in, jean, perr, al, s, fresco, of, the, liberal, arts, in, le, puy, cathedral, but, this, has, not, achieved, acceptance, from, other, scholars, an, 1811, painting, by, charles, gustave, housez, depicts, josquin, it, was, created, long, after, the, composer, s, death, but, clercx, lejeune, has, contended, that, it, is, an, older, portrait, which, housez, restored, and, modified, elders, described, josquin, as, the, first, composer, in, the, history, of, western, music, not, to, have, been, forgotten, after, his, death, while, john, milsom, called, him, the, towering, composer, of, the, renaissance, fallows, wrote, that, his, influence, on, 16th, century, european, music, is, comparable, to, that, of, beethoven, on, the, 19th, and, igor, stravinsky, on, the, 20th, century, comparisons, with, beethoven, are, particularly, common, though, taruskin, cautions, that, drawing, parallels, between, is, easy, doing, so, has, become, traditional, in, music, historiography, unease, with, this, tradition, has, occasionally, been, expressed, by, those, who, see, in, it, a, danger, to, an, unprejudiced, view, of, josquin, and, his, time, to, think, of, josquin, merely, as, a, fifteenth, or, sixteenth, century, beethoven, would, be, like, placing, him, behind, the, nearer, figure, and, thereby, obscuring, him, from, view, his, popularity, led, to, imitation, by, fellow, composers, and, some, publishers, especially, in, germany, misattributed, works, to, him, after, his, death, to, meet, the, demand, for, new, josquin, compositions, this, inspired, a, well, known, remark, that, now, that, josquin, is, dead, he, is, producing, more, compositions, than, when, he, was, still, alive, fallows, asserts, that, the, issue, was, more, complex, than, publishers, attempting, to, increase, their, profits, similar, names, of, composers, and, compositions, caused, confusion, as, did, works, which, quoted, josquin, or, student, works, which, imitated, his, style, josquin, s, pupils, may, have, included, jean, lh, ritier, and, nicolas, gombert, coclico, claimed, to, be, his, student, though, his, statements, are, notoriously, unreliable, numerous, composers, wrote, laments, after, his, death, three, of, which, were, published, by, tielman, susato, in, a, 1545, edition, of, josquin, s, music, these, included, works, by, benedictus, appenzeller, gombert, jacquet, of, mantua, and, jheronimus, vinders, as, well, as, the, anonymous, absolve, quaesumus, while, jean, richafort, s, requiem, musically, quoted, him, josquin, s, compositions, traveled, widely, after, his, death, more, so, than, those, of, du, fay,

performed, his, works, regularly, throughout, the, late, 16th, century, and, into, the, 17th, instrumental, arrangements, of, his, works, were, often, published, from, the, 1530s, to, the, 1590s, josquin, was, described, by, taruskin, as, the, master, architect, of, high, renaissance, music, and, his, compositions, were, parodied, or, quoted, throughout, europe, by, almost, every, major, composer, of, the, later, renaissance, including, arcadelt, brumel, bartolom, de, escobedo, antoine, de, f, vin, robert, de, f, vin, george, de, la, h, le, lupus, hellinck, pierre, hesdin, lassus,

reputation, during, his, lifetime, his, composition, of, masses, was, commended, by, paolo, cortesi, and, the, poet, jean, molinet, and, the, music, theorists, gaffurius, and, pietro, aron, wrote, about, his, works, josquin, s, popularity, during, his, lifetime, is, also, suggested, by, publications, petrucci, s, misse, josquin, of, 1502, was, the, first, single, composer, mass, anthology, and, josquin, was, the, only, composer, whose, masses, merited, a, second, and, a, third, volume, fallows, asserts, that, josquin, gained, european, renown, between, 1494, and, 1503, since, the, petrucci, publications, and, references, by, gaffurius, and, molinet, occurred, during, this, time, after, josquin, s, death, humanists, such, as, cosimo, bartoli, baldassare, castiglione, and, fran, ois, rabelais, praised, him, with, bartoli, describing, him, as, michelangelo, s, equal, in, music, josquin, was, championed, by, the, later, theorists, heinrich, glarean, and, gioseffo, zarlino, and, the, theologian, martin, luther, declared, he, is, the, master, of, the, notes, they, must, do, as, he, wills, as, for, the, other, composers, they, have, to, do, as, the, notes, will, upon, the, emergence, of, baroque, music, in, the, 17th, century, josquin, s, dominance, began, to, lessen, he, was, overshadowed, by, palestrina, who, dominated, the, pre, common, practice, period, musical, narrative, and, whose, compositions, were, considered, the, summit, of, polyphonic, refinement, until, the, 20th, century, discussion, of, josquin, s, music, was, mainly, limited, to, music, scholars, such, as, the, theorists, angelo, berardi, in, the, 1680s, 1690s, and, johann, gottfried, walther, in, 1732, the, late, 18th, century, saw, a, new, interest, in, netherlandish, music, studies, from, charles, burney, johann, nikolaus, forkel, raphael, georg, kiesewetter, and, fran, ois, joseph, f, tis, gave, josquin, more, prominence, the, music, historian, august, wilhelm, ambros, described, josquin, in, the, 1860s, as, one, of, the, towering, figures, of, western, music, history, not, merely, a, forerunner, of, palestrina, but, his, equal, and, his, research, established, the, foundation, for, modern, josquin, scholarship, in, the, early, 20th, century, leading, musicologists, such, as, alfred, einstein, and, carl, dahlhaus, largely, dismissed, josquin, various, publications, then, began, to, raise, his, status, beginning, with, a, new, edition, of, his, complete, works, by, albert, smijers, 1920s, and, high, evaluation, by, friedrich, blume, in, the, das, chorwerk, series, the, early, music, revival, raised, josquin, s, status, and, brought, the, first, major, study, on, him, by, helmuth, osthoff, vol, 1, 1962, vol, 2, 1965, an, influential, article, by, lowinsky, 1964, and, debates, between, the, musicologist, joseph, kerman, and, lowinsky, 1965, the, 1971, international, josquin, festival, conference, firmly, established, josquin, in, the, center, of, renaissance, music, a, position, later, cemented, by, lowinsky, s, 1976, monograph, the, new, josquin, edition, began, publication, in, 1987, reflecting, on, the, sentiment, that, josquin, was, the, greatest, composer, of, his, generation, and, the, most, important, innovative, and, influential, composer, of, the, late, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, sherr, notes, growing, dissent, from, that, position, in, the, early, 21st, century, josquin, s, 2001, article, in, grove, music, online, lists, fewer, than, 200, works, attributed, to, him, down, from, more, than, 370, these,

josquin, s, biography, with, entire, portions, of, it, being, rewritten, due, to, josquin, having, been, confused, with, people, with, similar, names, controversy, has, arisen, about, the, extent, of, josquin, s, influence, there, is, no, doubt, about, his, importance, in, western, music, but, some, scholars, have, contended, that, the, extent, of, his, reevaluation, has, unrealistically, apotheosized, him, over, his, contemporaries, wegman, asserts, that, obrecht, was, more, highly, regarded, in, josquin, s, time, to, which, noble, has, noted, that, josquin, s, prestigious, positions, publications, and, employers, scarcely, looks, like, the, career, of, an, unregarded, composer, reflecting, on, the, dispute, sherr, has, concluded, that, josquin, s, reputation, is, somewhat, lessened, but, on, the, basis, of, his, most, admired, and, firmly, attributed, works, he, remains, one, of, the, towering, figures, in, the, history, of, music, since, the, 1950s, josquin, s, music, has, become, central, to, the, repertoire, of, many, early, music, vocal, ensembles, and, has, been, increasingly, featured, in, recordings, with, those, by, the, hilliard, ensemble, orlando, consort,
