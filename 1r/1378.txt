shevardnadze, s, rapid, rise, in, soviet, georgia, s, political, hierarchy, was, the, result, of, his, campaign, against, corruption, throughout, most, of, shevardnadze, s, leadership, anti, corruption, campaigns, were, central, to, his, authority, and, policy, by, the, time, shevardnadze, had, become, leader, georgia, was, the, soviet, republic, most, afflicted, by, corruption, the, rule, of, vasil, mzhavanadze, had, been, characterised, by, weak, leadership, nepotism, despotism, and, bribery, pervading, the, upper, echelons, of, power, in, georgia, corruption, had, been, allowed, to, thrive, leading, to, serious, deformations, in, the, system, for, example, only, 68, per, cent, of, georgian, goods, were, exported, legally, while, the, percentage, of, goods, exported, legally, from, other, soviet, republics, approached, 100, per, cent, shevardnadze, rallied, support, for, his, anti, corruption, campaigns, by, establishing, the, study, of, public, opinion, to,

personal, subterfuge, the, entire, georgian, border, police, was, purged, while, never, proven, it, is, said, that, after, taking, office, shevardnadze, asked, all, leading, officials, to, show, their, left, hands, and, ordered, those, who, used, western, produced, watches, to, replace, them, with, soviet, ones, this, story, portrayed, shevardnadze, as, an, active, battler, against, corruption, his, campaign, against, corruption, was, largely, unsuccessful, and, when, he, returned, to, georgia, in, 1992, corruption, was, still, a, huge, problem, under, shevardnadze, s, rule, georgia, was, one, of, several, soviet, republics, that, did, not, experience, economic, stagnation, instead, experiencing, rapid, economic, growth, by, 1974, industrial, output, had, increased, by, 9, 6, per, cent, and, agricultural, output, had, increased, by, 18, per, cent, the, shortage, economy, which, had, evolved, into, a, prevalent, problem, in, other, parts, of, the, soviet, union, had, nearly, disappeared, in, georgia, long, food, queues, in, tbilisi, had, shortened, while, those, in, moscow, had, lengthened, some, of, shevardnadze, s, economic, policies, were, adopted, nationally, by, the, soviet, government, in, 1973, shevardnadze, launched, an, agricultural, reform, in, abasha, popularly, referred, to, as, the, abasha, experiment, this, reform, was, inspired, by, j, nos, k, d, r, s, agricultural, policy, in, hungarian, people, s, republic, which, returned, agricultural, decision, making, to, the, local, level, of, governance, shevardnadze, merged, all, abasha, agricultural, institutions, into, a, single, entity, and, established, a, new, remuneration, system, if, a, farmer, fulfilled, the, five, year, plan, early, he, would, be, awarded, a, share, of, the, crops, the, policy, had, a, positive, effect, on, the, georgian, economy, and, because, of, the, large, increase, of, agricultural, output, in, abasha, the, reform, was, introduced, elsewhere, in, the, republic, the, agricultural, reform, in, georgia, became, the, model, of, the, nationwide, agricultural, industrial, organisations, established, by, a, decree, in, 1982, shevardnadze, took, much, of, the, credit, for, georgia, s, economic, performance, under, his, rule, seven, months, before, his, promotion, to, the, soviet, foreign, affairs, ministership, shevardnadze, said, there, were, thirty, or, more, economic, experiments, operating, in, georgia, which, he, said, would, further, democratise, the, economic, management, shevardnadze, was, a, strong, supporter, of, political, reform, in, the, georgian, ssr, he, created, agencies, attached, to, the, central, committee, of, the, georgian, communist, party, whose, main, task, was, studying, analysing, and, moulding, public, opinion, these, agencies, worked, closely, with, georgia, s, communications, networks, and, media, government, ministers, and, shevardnadze, were, regularly, interviewed, live, on, television, shevardnadze, criticised, flattery, in, georgia, and, said, he, and, his, government, s, activities, needed, to, be, criticised, more, often, especially, during, party, congresses, he, showed, himself, even, before, mikhail, gorbachev, s, rise, to, power, to, be, a, firm, supporter, of, people, s, democracy, i, e, power, from, below, previous, soviet, georgian, rulers, had, given, in, to, nationalist, favouritism, to, the, georgians, shevardnadze, was, against, this, policy, of, favouritism, therefore, his, nationalistic, policy, is, considered, controversial, in, georgia, at, the, 25th, congress, of, the, georgian, communist, party, shevardnadze, told, the, congress, for, georgians, the, sun, rises, not, in, the, east, but, in, the, north, in, russia, shevardnadze, saw, extreme, nationalism, coupled, with, corruption, and, inefficiencies, within, the, system, as, one, of, the, main, obstacles, to, economic, growth, during, his, rule, he, condemned, what, he, considered, national, narrow, mindedness, and, isolation, and, writers, who, published, works, with, nationalistic, overtones, the, 1970s, saw, an, increase, in, nationalistic, tendencies, in, georgian, society, the, 1978, georgian, demonstrations, were, sparked, by, the, soviet, government, s, decision, to, amend, the, georgian, constitution, and, remove, the, georgian, language, as, the, sole, state, language, in, the, republic, while, at, first, standing, firm, with, the, soviet, government, shevardnadze, quickly, reiterated, his, position, and, was, able, to, compromise, with, the, soviet, government, and, the, demonstrators, the, georgian, language, was, kept, as, the, sole, official, language, of, the, republic, and, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, soviet, union, passed, legislation, calling, for, an, increasing, level, of, russian, language, training, in, the, non, russian, republics, there, was, another, problem, facing, shevardnadze, during, the, 1978, demonstrations, some, leading, abkhaz, intellectuals, were, writing, to, leonid, brezhnev, in, the, hope, that, he, would, let, the, abkhaz, autonomous, soviet, socialist, republic, secede, from, georgia, and, merge, into, the, russian, sfsr, to, halt, this, development, the, georgian, government, gave, way, to, concessions, made, by, the, secessionists, that, included, establishing, an, abkhaz, university, the, expansion, of, abkhaz, publications, and, creating, an, abkhaz, television, station, shevardnadze, proved, to, be, an, active, supporter, of, defending, minority, interests, at, the, 25th, congress, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, cpsu, in, 1976, shevardnadze, gave, a, speech, in, which, he, called, general, secretary, leonid, brezhnev, vozhd, leader, a, term, previously, reserved, for, joseph, stalin, his, adulation, was, only, surpassed, by, that, of, andrei, kirilenko, and, heydar, aliyev, as, yegor, ligachev, later, said, shevardnadze, never, contradicted, a, general, secretary, during, brezhnev, s, last, days, shevardnadze, publicly, endorsed, konstantin, chernenko, s, candidature, for, the, general, secretaryship, and, called, him, a, great, theoretician, however, when, it, became, clear, that, the, secretaryship, would, not, go, to, chernenko, but, to, yuri, andropov, shevardnadze, swiftly, revised, his, position, and, gave, his, support, to, andropov, shevardnadze, became, the, first, soviet, republican, head, to, offer, his, gratitude, to, the, newly, elected, leader, in, turn, andropov, quickly, signalled, his, appreciation, and, his, support, for, some, of, the, reforms, pioneered, by, shevardnadze, according, to, andropov, s, biographers, the, anti, corruption, drive, he, launched, was, inspired, by, shervardnadze, s, georgian, anti, corruption, campaign, when, andropov, died, shevardnadze, again, became, an, avid, supporter, of, chernenko, s, candidature, for, the, general, secretaryship, when, chernenko, died, shevardnadze, became, a, strong, supporter, of, mikhail, gorbachev, s, leadership, candidature, shevardnadze, became, a, member, of, the, central, committee, cc, of, the, cpsu, in, 1976, and, in, 1978, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, non, voting, candidate, member, of, the, soviet, political, bureau, politburo, his, chance, came, in, 1985, when, the, veteran, soviet, minister, of, foreign, affairs, andrei, gromyko, left, that, post, for, the, largely, ceremonial, position, of, chairman, of, the, presidium, of, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, soviet, union, official, head, of, state, the, de, facto, leader, communist, party, general, secretary, mikhail, gorbachev, appointed, shevardnadze, to, replace, gromyko, as, minister, of, foreign, affairs, thus, consolidating, gorbachev, s, circle, of, relatively, young, reformers, shevardnadze, was, a, close, ally, of, gorbachev, and, was, a, strong, advocate, of, the, reform, policies, of, glasnost, and, perestroika, he, subsequently, played, a, key, role, in, the, d, tente, that, marked, the, end, of, the, cold, war, he, negotiated, nuclear, arms, treaties, with, the, united, states, he, helped, end, the, war, in, afghanistan, allowed, the, reunification, of, germany, and, withdrew, soviet, forces, from, eastern, europe, and, from, the, chinese, border, he, earned, the, nickname, the, silver, fox, during, the, late, 1980s, as, the, soviet, union, descended, into, crisis, shevardnadze, became, increasingly, unpopular, and, was, in, conflict, with, soviet, hard, liners, who, disliked, his, reforms, and, his, soft, line, with, the, west, he, criticised, a, campaign, by, soviet, troops, to, put, down, an, uprising, in, his, native, georgia, in, 1989, in, protest, over, the, growing, influence, of, hardliners, under, gorbachev, shevardnadze, suddenly, resigned, in, december, 1990, saying, dictatorship, is, coming, a, few, months, later, his, fears, were, partially, realised, when, an, unsuccessful, coup, by, communist, hardliners, precipitated, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, shevardnadze, returned, briefly, as, soviet, foreign, minister, in, november, 1991, but, resigned, with, gorbachev, the, following, month, when, the, soviet, union, was, formally, dissolved, in, 1991, shevardnadze, was, baptized, into, the, georgian, orthodox, church, the, newly, independent, republic, of, georgia, elected, as, its, first, president, a, leader, of, the, national, liberation, movement, zviad, gamsakhurdia, an, academic, and, writer, who, had, been, imprisoned, by, shevardnadze, s, government, in, the, late, 1970s, however, gamsakhurdia, s, rule, ended, abruptly, in, january, 1992, when, he, was, deposed, in, a, bloody, coup, d, tat, shevardnadze, was, appointed, speaker, of, the, georgian, parliament, in, march, 1992, and, as, speaker, of, parliament, in, november, both, of, these, posts, were, equivalent, to, that, of, president, when, the,

of, vote, rigging, shevardnadze, s, career, as, georgian, president, was, in, some, respects, more, challenging, than, his, earlier, career, as, soviet, foreign, minister, he, faced, many, enemies, some, dating, back, to, his, campaigns, against, corruption, and, nationalism, during, soviet, times, like, gamsakhurdia, shevardnadze, had, to, deal, with, russian, backed, violent, separatists, in, the, georgian, provinces, of, south, ossetia, and, abkhazia, a, georgian, civil, war, between, supporters, of, gamsakhurdia, and, shevardnadze, broke, out, in, western, georgia, in, 1993, but, was,

were, further, exacerbated, when, russia, accused, georgia, of, harbouring, chechen, guerrillas, on, georgia, s, northern, border, during, the, second, chechen, war, more, friction, was, caused, by, shevardnadze, s, close, relationship, with, the, united, states, which, saw, him, as, a, counterbalance, to, russian, influence, in, the, strategic, transcaucasus, region, under, shevardnadze, s,
