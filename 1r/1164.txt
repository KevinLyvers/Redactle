at, the, battle, of, bannockburn, in, 1314, robert, defeated, a, much, larger, english, army, under, edward, ii, of, england, confirming, the, re, establishment, of, an, independent, scottish, kingdom, the, battle, marked, a, significant, turning, point, with, robert, s, armies, now, free, to, launch, devastating, raids, throughout, northern, england, while, he, also, expanded, the, war, against, england, by, sending, armies, to, invade, ireland, and, appealed, to, the, irish, to, rise, against, edward, ii, s, rule, despite, bannockburn, and, the, capture, of, the, final, english,

robert, i, died, in, june, 1329, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, david, ii, robert, s, body, is, buried, in, dunfermline, abbey, while, his, heart, was, interred, in, melrose, abbey, and, his, internal, organs, embalmed, and, placed, in, st, serf, s, church, dumbarton, robert, the, bruce, was, born, on, 11, july, 1274, his, place, of, birth, is, not, known, for, certain, although, it, most, likely, was, turnberry, castle, in, ayrshire, the, head, of, his, mother, s, earldom, despite, claims, that, he, may, have, been, born, in, lochmaben, in, dumfriesshire, or, writtle, in, essex, robert, de, brus, 1st, lord, of, annandale, the, first, of, the, bruce, de, brus, line, had, settled, in, scotland, during, the, reign, of, king, david, i, and, was, granted, the, lordship, of, annandale, in, 1124, the, future, king, was, one, of, ten, children, and, the, eldest, son, of, robert, de, brus, 6th, lord, of, annandale, and, marjorie, countess, of, carrick, from, his, mother, he, inherited, the, earldom, of, carrick, and, through, his, father, the, lordship, of, annandale, and, a, royal, lineage, as, a, fourth, great, grandson, of, david, i, that, would, give, him, a, claim, to, the, scottish, throne, in, addition, to, the, lordship, of, annandale, the, bruces, also, held, lands, in, aberdeenshire, and, dundee, and, substantial, estates, in, england, in, cumberland, county, durham, essex, middlesex, northumberland, and, yorkshire, and, in, county, antrim, in, ireland, very, little, is, known, of, his, youth, he, was, probably, brought, up, in, a, mixture, of, the, anglo, norman, culture, of, northern, england, and, south, eastern, scotland, and, the, gaelic, culture, of, southwest, scotland, and, most, of, scotland, north, of, the, river, forth, annandale, was, thoroughly, feudalised, and, the, form, of, northern, middle, english, that, would, later, develop, into, the, scots, language, was, spoken, throughout, the, region, carrick, was, historically, an, integral, part, of, galloway, and, though, the, earls, of, carrick, had, achieved, some, feudalisation, the, society, of, carrick, at, the, end, of, the, thirteenth, century, remained, emphatically, celtic, and, gaelic, speaking, robert, the, bruce, would, most, probably, have, become, trilingual, at, an, early, age, he, would, have, been, schooled, to, speak, read, and, possibly, write, in, the, anglo, norman, language, of, his, scots, norman, peers, and, the, scoto, norman, portion, of, his, family, he, would, also, have, spoken, both, the, gaelic, language, of, his, carrick, birthplace, and, his, mother, s, family, and, the, early, scots, language, as, the, heir, to, a, considerable, estate, and, a, pious, layman, robert, would, also, have, been, given, working, knowledge, of, latin, the, language, of, charter, lordship, liturgy, and, prayer, this, would, have, afforded, robert, and, his, brothers, access, to, basic, education, in, the, law, politics, scripture, saints, lives, vitae, philosophy, history, and, chivalric, instruction, and, romance, barbour, reported, that, robert, read, aloud, to, his, band, of, supporters, in, 1306, reciting, from, memory, tales, from, a, twelfth, century, romance, of, charlemagne, fierabras, as, well, as, relating, examples, from, history, such, as, hannibal, s, defiance, of, rome, as, king, robert, certainly, commissioned, verse, to, commemorate, bannockburn, and, his, subjects, military, deeds, contemporary, chroniclers, jean, le, bel, and, thomas, grey, would, both, assert, that, they, had, read, a, history, of, his, reign, commissioned, by, king, robert, himself, in, his, last, years, robert, would, pay, for, dominican, friars, to, tutor, his, son, david, for, whom, he, would, also, purchase, books, a, parliamentary, briefing, document, of, c, 1364, would, also, assert, that, robert, used, continually, to, read, or, have, read, in, his, presence, the, histories, of, ancient, kings, and, princes, and, how, they, conducted, themselves, in, their, times, both, in, wartime, and, in, peacetime, from, these, he, derived, information, about, aspects, of, his, own, rule, tutors, for, the, young, robert, and, his, brothers, were, most, likely, drawn, from, unbeneficed, clergy, or, mendicant, friars, associated, with, the, churches, patronised, by, their, family, however, as, growing, noble, youths, outdoor, pursuits, and, great, events, would, also, have, held, a, strong, fascination, for, robert, and, his, brothers, they, would, have, had, masters, drawn, from, their, parents, household, to, school, them, in, the, arts, of, horsemanship, swordsmanship, the, joust, hunting, and, perhaps, aspects, of, courtly, behaviour, including, dress, protocol, speech, table, etiquette, music, and, dance, some, of, which, may, have, been, learned, before, the, age, of, ten, while, serving, as, pages, in, their, father, s, or, grandfather, s, household, as, many, of, these, personal, and, leadership, skills, were, bound, up, within, a, code, of, chivalry, robert, s, chief, tutor, was, surely, a, reputable, experienced, knight, drawn, from, his, grandfather, s, crusade, retinue, this, grandfather, known, to, contemporaries, as, robert, the, noble, and, to, history, as, bruce, the, competitor, seems, to, have, been, an, immense, influence, on, the, future, king, robert, s, later, performance, in, war, certainly, underlines, his, skills, in, tactics, and, single, combat, the, family, would, have, moved, between, the, castles, of, their, lordships, lochmaben, castle, the, main, castle, of, the, lordship, of, annandale, and, turnberry, and, loch, doon, castle, the, castles, of, the, earldom, of, carrick, a, significant, and, profound, part, of, the, childhood, experience, of, robert, edward, and, possibly, the, other, bruce, brothers, neil, thomas, and, alexander, was, also, gained, through, the, gaelic, tradition, of, being, fostered, to, allied, gaelic, kindreds, a, traditional, practice, in, carrick, southwest, and, western, scotland, the, hebrides, and, ireland, there, were, a, number, of, carrick, ayrshire, hebridean, and, irish, families, and, kindreds, affiliated, with, the, bruces, who, might, have, performed, such, a, service, robert, s, foster, brother, is, referred, to, by, barbour, as, sharing, robert, s, precarious, existence, as, an, outlaw, in, carrick, in, 1307, 1308, this, gaelic, influence, has, been, cited, as, a, possible, explanation, for, robert, the, bruce, s, apparent, affinity, for, hobelar, warfare, using, smaller, sturdy, ponies, in, mounted, raids, as, well, as, for, sea, power, ranging, from, oared, war, galleys, birlinns, to, boats, according, to, historians, such, as, barrow, and, penman, it, is, also, likely, that, when, robert, and, edward, bruce, reached, the, male, age, of, consent, of, twelve, and, began, training, for, full, knighthood, they, were, sent, to, reside, for, a, period, with, one, or, more, allied, english, noble, families, such, as, the, de, clares, of, gloucester, or, perhaps, even, in, the, english, royal, household, sir, thomas, grey, asserted, in, his, scalacronica, that, in, about, 1292, robert, the, bruce, then, aged, eighteen, was, a, young, bachelor, of, king, edward, s, chamber, while, there, remains, little, firm, evidence, of, robert, s, presence, at, edward, s, court, on, 8, april, 1296, both, robert, and, his, father, were, pursued, through, the, english, chancery, for, their, private, household, debts, of, 60, by, several, merchants, of, winchester, this, raises, the, possibility, that, young, robert, the, bruce, was, on, occasion, resident, in, a, royal, centre, which, edward, i, himself, would, visit, frequently, during, his, reign, robert, s, first, appearance, in, history, is, on, a, witness, list, of, a, charter, issued, by, alexander, og, macdonald, lord, of, islay, his, name, appears, in, the, company, of, the, bishop, of, argyll, the, vicar, of, arran, a, kintyre, clerk, his, father, and, a, host, of, gaelic, notaries, from, carrick, robert, bruce, the, king, to, be, was, sixteen, years, of, age, when, margaret, maid, of, norway, died, in, 1290, it, is, also, around, this, time, that, robert, would, have, been, knighted, and, he, began, to, appear, on, the, political, stage, in, the, bruce, dynastic, interest, robert, s, mother, died, early, in, 1292, in, november, of, the, same, year, edward, i, of, england, on, behalf, of, the, guardians, of, scotland, and, following, the, great, cause, awarded, the, vacant, crown, of, scotland, to, his, grandfather, s, first, cousin, once, removed, john, balliol, almost, immediately, robert, de, brus, 5th, lord, of, annandale, resigned, his, lordship, of, annandale, and, transferred, his, claim, to, the, scottish, throne, to, his, son, antedating, this, statement, to, 7, november, in, turn, that, son, robert, de, brus, 6th, lord, of, annandale, resigned, his, earldom, of, carrick, to, his, eldest, son, robert, the, future, king, so, as, to, protect, the, bruce, s, kingship, claim, while, their, middle, lord, robert, the, bruce, s, father, now, held, only, english, lands, while, the, bruces, bid, for, the, throne, had, ended, in, failure, the, balliols, triumph, propelled, the, eighteen, year, old, robert, the, bruce, onto, the, political, stage, in, his, own, right, even, after, john, s, accession, edward, continued, to, assert, his, authority, over, scotland, and, relations, between, the, two, kings, soon, deteriorated, the, bruces, sided, with, king, edward, against, king, john, and, his, comyn, allies, robert, the, bruce, and, his, father, both, considered, john, a, usurper, against, the, objections, of, the, scots, edward, i, agreed, to, hear, appeals, on, cases, ruled, on, by, the, court, of, the, guardians, that, had, governed, scotland, during, the, interregnum, a, further, provocation, came, in, a, case, brought, by, macduff, son, of, malcolm, earl, of, fife, in, which, edward, demanded, that, john, appear, in, person, before, the, english, parliament, to, answer, the, charges, this, the, scottish, king, did, but, the, final, straw, was, edward, s, demand, that, the, scottish, magnates, provide, military, service, in, england, s, war, against, france, this, was, unacceptable, the, scots, instead, formed, an, alliance, with, france, the, comyn, dominated, council, acting, in, the, name, of, king, john, summoned, the, scottish, host, to, meet, at, caddonlee, on, 11, march, the, bruces, and, the, earls, of, angus, and, march, refused, and, the, bruce, family, withdrew, temporarily, from, scotland, while, the, comyns, seized, their, estates, in, annandale, and, carrick, granting, them, to, john, comyn, earl, of, buchan, edward, i, thereupon, provided, a, safe, refuge, for, the, bruces, having, appointed, the, lord, of, annandale, to, the, command, of, carlisle, castle, in, october, 1295, at, some, point, in, early, 1296, robert, married, his, first, wife, isabella, of, mar, the, daughter, of, domhnall, i, earl, of, mar, isabella, died, shortly, after, their, marriage, either, during, or, shortly, after, the, birth, of, their, only, child, marjorie, bruce, almost, the, first, blow, in, the, war, between, scotland, and, england, was, a, direct, attack, on, the, bruces, on, 26, march, 1296, easter, monday, seven, scottish, earls, made, a, surprise, attack, on, the, walled, city, of, carlisle, which, was, not, so, much, an, attack, against, england, as, the, comyn, earl, of, buchan, and, their, faction, attacking, their, bruce, enemies, both, his, father, and, grandfather, were, at, one, time, governors, of, the, castle, and, following, the, loss, of, annandale, to, comyn, in, 1295, it, was, their, principal, residence, robert, bruce, would, have, gained, first, hand, knowledge, of, the, city, s, defences, the, next, time, carlisle, was, besieged, in, 1315, robert, the, bruce, would, be, leading, the, attack, edward, i, responded, to, king, john, s, alliance, with, france, and, the, attack, on, carlisle, by, invading, scotland, at, the, end, of, march, 1296, and, taking, the, town, of, berwick, in, a, particularly, bloody, attack, upon, the, flimsy, palisades, at, the, battle, of, dunbar, scottish, resistance, was, effectively, crushed, edward, deposed, king, john, placed, him, in, the, tower, of, london, and, installed, englishmen, to, govern, the, country, the, campaign, had, been, very, successful, but, the, english, triumph, would, be, only, temporary, although, the, bruces, were, by, now, back, in, possession, of, annandale, and, carrick, in, august, 1296, robert, bruce, lord, of, annandale, and, his, son, robert, bruce, earl, of, carrick, and, future, king, were, among, the, more, than, 1, 500, scots, at, berwick, who, swore, an, oath, of, fealty, to, king, edward, i, of, england, when, the, scottish, revolt, against, edward, i, broke, out, in, july, 1297, james, stewart, 5th, high, steward, of, scotland, led, into, rebellion, a, group, of, disaffected, scots, including, robert, wishart, bishop, of, glasgow, macduff, of, fife, and, the, young, robert, bruce, the, future, king, was, now, twenty, two, and, in, joining, the, rebels, he, seems, to, have, been, acting, independently, of, his, father, who, took, no, part, in, the, rebellion, and, appears, to, have, abandoned, annandale, once, more, for, the, safety, of, carlisle, it, appears, that, robert, bruce, had, fallen, under, the, influence, of, his, grandfather, s, friends, wishart, and, stewart, who, had, inspired, him, to, resistance, with, the, outbreak, of, the, revolt, robert, left, carlisle, and, made, his, way, to, annandale, where, he, called, together, the, knights, of, his, ancestral, lands, and, according, to, the, english, chronicler, walter, of, guisborough, addressed, them, thus, no, man, holds, his, own, flesh, and, blood, in, hatred, and, i, am, no, exception, i, must, join, my, own, people, and, the, nation, in, which, i, was, born, i, ask, that, you, please, come, with, me, and, you, will, be, my, councillors, and, close, comrades, urgent, letters, were, sent, ordering, bruce, to, support, edward, s, commander, john, de, warenne, 6th, earl, of, surrey, to, whom, bruce, was, related, in, the, summer, of, 1297, but, instead, of, complying, bruce, continued, to, support, the, revolt, against, edward, i, that, bruce, was, in, the, forefront, of, inciting, rebellion, is, shown, in, a, letter, written, to, edward, by, hugh, cressingham, on, 23, july, 1292, which, reports, the, opinion, that, if, you, had, the, earl, of, carrick, the, steward, of, scotland, and, his, brother, you, would, think, your, business, done, on, 7, july, bruce, and, his, friends, made, terms, with, edward, by, a, treaty, called, the, capitulation, of, irvine, the, scottish, lords, were, not, to, serve, beyond, the, sea, against, their, will, and, were, pardoned, for, their, recent, violence, in, return, for, swearing, allegiance, to, king, edward, the, bishop, of, glasgow, james, the, steward, and, sir, alexander, lindsay, became, sureties, for, bruce, until, he, delivered, his, infant, daughter, marjorie, as, a, hostage, which, he, never, did, when, king, edward, returned, to, england, after, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, falkirk, the, bruce, s, possessions, were, excepted, from, the, lordships, and, lands, that, edward, assigned, to, his, followers, the, reason, for, this, is, uncertain, though, fordun, records, robert, fighting, for, edward, at, falkirk, under, the, command, of, antony, bek, bishop, of, durham, annandale, and, carrick, this, participation, is, contested, as, no, bruce, appears, on, the, falkirk, roll, of, nobles, present, in, the, english, army, and, two, 19th, century, antiquarians, alexander, murison, and, george, chalmers, have, stated, that, bruce, did, not, participate, and, in, the, following, month, decided, to, lay, waste, to, annandale, and, burn, ayr, castle, to, prevent, it, being, garrisoned, by, the, english, william, wallace, resigned, as, guardian, of, scotland, after, his, defeat, at, the, battle, of, falkirk, he, was, succeeded, by, robert, bruce, and, john, comyn, as, joint, guardians, but, they, could, not, see, past, their, personal, differences, as, a, nephew, and, supporter, of, king, john, and, as, someone, with, a, serious, claim, to, the, scottish, throne, comyn, was, bruce, s, enemy, in, 1299, william, lamberton, bishop, of, st, andrews, was, appointed, as, a, third, neutral, guardian, to, try, to, maintain, order, between, bruce, and, comyn, the, following, year, bruce, finally, resigned, as, joint, guardian, and, was, replaced, by, sir, gilbert, de, umfraville, earl, of, angus, in, may, 1301, umfraville, comyn, and, lamberton, also, resigned, as, joint, guardians, and, were, replaced, by, sir, john, de, soules, as, sole, guardian, soules, was, appointed, largely, because, he, was, part, of, neither, the, bruce, nor, the, comyn, camps, and, was, a, patriot, he, was, an, active, guardian, and, made, renewed, efforts, to, have, king, john, returned, to, the, scottish, throne, in, july, 1301, king, edward, i, launched, his, sixth, campaign, into, scotland, though, he, captured, the, castles, of, bothwell, and, turnberry, he, did, little, to, damage, the, scots, fighting, ability, and, in, january, 1302, he, agreed, to, a, nine, month, truce, it, was, around, this, time, that, robert, the, bruce, submitted, to, edward, along, with, other, nobles, even, though, he, had, been, on, the, side, of, the, scots, until, then, there, were, rumours, that, john, balliol, would, return, to, regain, the, scottish, throne, soules, who, had, probably, been, appointed, by, john, supported, his, return, as, did, most, other, nobles, but, it, was, no, more, than, a, rumour, and, nothing, came, of, it, in, march, 1302, bruce, sent, a, letter, to, the, monks, at, melrose, abbey, apologising, for, having, called, tenants, of, the, monks, to, service, in, his, army, when, there, had, been, no, national, call, up, bruce, pledged, that, henceforth, he, would, never, again, require, the, monks, to, serve, unless, it, was, to, the, common, army, of, the, whole, realm, for, national, defence, bruce, also, married, his, second, wife, that, year, elizabeth, de, burgh, the, daughter, of, richard, de, burgh, 2nd, earl, of, ulster, in, writtle, near, chelmsford, in, essex, elizabeth, was, about, 13, at, the, time, and, bruce, 28, by, elizabeth, he, had, four, children, david, ii, john, died, in, childhood, matilda, who, married, thomas, isaac, and, died, at, aberdeen, 20, july, 1353, and, margaret, who, married, william, de, moravia, 5th, earl, of, sutherland, in, 1345, in, 1303, edward, invaded, again, reaching, edinburgh, before, marching, to, perth, edward, stayed, in, perth, until, july, then, proceeded, via, dundee, brechin, and, montrose, to, aberdeen, where, he, arrived, in, august, from, there, he, marched, through, moray, to, badenoch, before, re, tracing, his, path, back, south, to, dunfermline, with, the, country, now, under, submission, all, the, leading, scots, except, for, william, wallace, surrendered, to, edward, in, february, 1304, john, comyn, who, was, by, now, guardian, again, submitted, to, edward, the, laws, and, liberties, of, scotland, were, to, be, as, they, had, been, in, the, days, of, alexander, iii, and, any, that, needed, alteration, would, be, with, the, assent, of, king, edward, and, the, advice, of, the, scots, nobles, on, 11, june, 1304, bruce, and, william, lamberton, made, a, pact, that, bound, them, each, to, the, other, in, friendship, and, alliance, against, all, men, if, one, should, break, the, secret, pact, he, would, forfeit, to, the, other, the, sum, of, ten, thousand, pounds, the, pact, is, often, interpreted, as, a, sign, of, their, patriotism, despite, both, having, already, surrendered, to, the, english, homage, was, again, obtained, from, the, nobles, and, the, burghs, and, a, parliament, was, held, to, elect, those, who, would, meet, later, in, the, year, with, the, english, parliament, to, establish, rules, for, the, governance, of, scotland, the, earl, of, richmond, edward, s, nephew, was, to, head, up, the, subordinate, government, of, scotland, while, all, this, took, place, william, wallace, was, finally, captured, near, glasgow, and, he, was, hanged, drawn, and, quartered, in, london, on, 23, august, 1305, in, september, 1305, edward, ordered, robert, bruce, to, put, his, castle, at, kildrummy, in, the, keeping, of, such, a, man, as, he, himself, will, be, willing, to, answer, for, suggesting, that, king, edward, suspected, robert, was, not, entirely, trustworthy, and, may, have, been, plotting, behind, his, back, however, an, identical, phrase, appears, in, an, agreement, between, edward, and, his, lieutenant, and, lifelong, friend, aymer, de, valence, a, further, sign, of, edward, s, distrust, occurred, on, 10, october, 1305, when, edward, revoked, his, gift, of, sir, gilbert, de, umfraville, s, lands, to, bruce, that, he, had, made, only, six, months, before, robert, bruce, as, earl, of, carrick, and, now, 7th, lord, of, annandale, held, huge, estates, and, property, in, scotland, and, a, barony, and, some, minor, properties, in, england, and, a, strong, claim, to, the, scottish, throne, bruce, like, all, his, family, had, a, complete, belief, in, his, right, to, the, throne, his, ambition, was, further, thwarted, by, john, comyn, who, supported, john, balliol, comyn, was, the, most, powerful, noble, in, scotland, and, was, related, to, many, other, powerful, nobles, both, within, scotland, and, england, including, relatives, that, held, the, earldoms, of, buchan, mar, ross, fife, angus, dunbar, and, strathearn, the, lordships, of, kilbride, kirkintilloch, lenzie, bedrule, and, scraesburgh, and, sheriffdoms, in, banff, dingwall, wigtown, and, aberdeen, he, also, had, a, powerful, claim, to, the, scottish, throne, through, his, descent, from, donald, iii, on, his, father, s, side, and, david, i, on, his, mother, s, side, comyn, was, the, nephew, of, john, balliol, according, to, barbour, and, fordoun, in, the, late, summer, of, 1305, in, a, secret, agreement, sworn, signed, and, sealed, john, comyn, agreed, to, forfeit, his, claim, to, the, scottish, throne, in, favour, of, robert, bruce, upon, receipt, of, the, bruce, lands, in, scotland, should, an, uprising, occur, led, by, bruce, whether, the, details, of, the, agreement, with, comyn, are, correct, or, not, king, edward, moved, to, arrest, bruce, while, bruce, was, still, at, the, english, court, ralph, de, monthermer, learned, of, edward, s, intention, and, warned, bruce, by, sending, him, twelve, pence, and, a, pair, of, spurs, bruce, took, the, hint, and, he, and, a, squire, fled, the, english, court, during, the, night, they, made, their, way, quickly, for, scotland, according, to, barbour, comyn, betrayed, his, agreement, with, bruce, to, king, edward, i, and, when, bruce, arranged, a, meeting, for, 10, february, 1306, with, comyn, in, the, chapel, of, greyfriars, monastery, in, dumfries, and, accused, him, of, treachery, they, came, to, blows, bruce, stabbed, comyn, before, the, high, altar, the, scotichronicon, says, that, on, being, told, that, comyn, had, survived, the, attack, and, was, being, treated, two, of, bruce, s, supporters, roger, de, kirkpatrick, uttering, the, words, i, mak, siccar, i, make, sure, and, john, lindsay, went, back, into, the, church, and, finished, bruce, s, work, barbour, however, tells, no, such, story, the, flores, historiarum, which, was, written, c, 1307, says, bruce, and, comyn, disagreed, and, bruce, drew, his, sword, and, struck, comyn, over, the, head, bruce, supporters, then, ran, up, and, stabbed, comyn, with, their, swords, bruce, asserted, his, claim, to, the, scottish, crown, and, began, his, campaign, by, force, for, the, independence, of, scotland, bruce, and, his, party, then, attacked, dumfries, castle, where, the, english, garrison, surrendered, bruce, hurried, from, dumfries, to, glasgow, where, his, friend, and, supporter, bishop, robert, wishart, granted, him, absolution, and, subsequently, adjured, the, clergy, throughout, the, land, to, rally, to, bruce, nonetheless, bruce, was, excommunicated, for, this, crime, six, weeks, after, comyn, was, killed, in, dumfries, bruce, was, crowned, king, of, scots, by, bishop, william, de, lamberton, at, scone, near, perth, on, palm, sunday, 25, march, 1306, with, all, formality, and, solemnity, the, royal, robes, and, vestments, that, robert, wishart, had, hidden, from, the, english, were, brought, out, by, the, bishop, and, set, upon, king, robert, the, bishops, of, moray, and, glasgow, were, in, attendance, as, were, the, earls, of, atholl, menteith, the, lennox, and, mar, the, great, banner, of, the, kings, of, scotland, was, planted, behind, bruce, s, throne, edward, i, marched, north, again, in, the, spring, of, 1306, on, his, way, he, granted, the, scottish, estates, of, bruce, and, his, adherents, to, his, own, followers, and, had, published, a, bill, excommunicating, bruce, in, june, bruce, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, methven, his, wife, and, daughters, and, other, women, of, the, party, were, sent, to, kildrummy, in, august, under, the, protection, of, bruce, s, brother, neil, bruce, and, the, earl, of, atholl, and, most, of, his, remaining, men, bruce, fled, with, a, small, following, of, his, most, faithful, men, including, sir, james, douglas, and, gilbert, hay, bruce, s, brothers, thomas, alexander, and, edward, as, well, as, sir, neil, campbell, and, the, earl, of, lennox, a, strong, force, under, edward, prince, of, wales, captured, kildrummy, castle, on, 13, september, 1306, taking, prisoner, the, king, s, youngest, brother, nigel, de, bruce, as, well, as, robert, boyd, and, alexander, lindsay, and, sir, simon, fraser, boyd, managed, to, escape, but, both, nigel, de, bruce, and, lindsay, were, executed, shortly, after, at, berwick, following, king, edward, s, orders, to, execute, all, followers, of, robert, de, bruce, fraser, was, taken, to, london, to, suffer, the, same, fate, shortly, before, the, fall, of, kildrummy, castle, the, earl, of, atholl, made, a, desperate, attempt, to, take, queen, elizabeth, de, burgh, margery, de, bruce, as, well, as, king, robert, s, sisters, and, isabella, of, fife, they, were, betrayed, a, few, days, later, and, also, fell, into, english, hands, atholl, to, be, executed, in, london, and, the, women, to, be, held, under, the, harshest, possible, circumstances, it, is, still, uncertain, where, bruce, spent, the, winter, of, 1306, 1307, most, likely, he, spent, it, in, the, hebrides, possibly, sheltered, by, christina, of, the, isles, the, latter, was, married, to, a, member, of, the, mar, kindred, a, family, to, which, bruce, was, related, not, only, was, his, first, wife, a, member, of, this, family, but, her, brother, gartnait, was, married, to, a, sister, of, bruce, ireland, is, also, a, serious, possibility, and, orkney, under, norwegian, rule, at, the, time, or, norway, proper, where, his, sister, isabel, bruce, was, queen, dowager, are, unlikely, but, not, impossible, bruce, and, his, followers, returned, to, the, scottish, mainland, in, february, 1307, in, two, groups, one, led, by, bruce, and, his, brother, edward, landed, at, turnberry, castle, and, began, a, guerrilla, war, in, south, west, scotland, the, other, led, by, his, brothers, thomas, and, alexander, landed, slightly, further, south, in, loch, ryan, but, they, were, soon, captured, and, executed, in, april, bruce, won, a, small, victory, over, the, english, at, the, battle, of, glen, trool, before, defeating, aymer, de, valence, 2nd, earl, of, pembroke, at, the, battle, of, loudoun, hill, at, the, same, time, james, douglas, made, his, first, foray, for, bruce, into, south, western, scotland, attacking, and, burning, his, own, castle, in, douglasdale, leaving, his, brother, edward, in, command, in, galloway, bruce, travelled, north, capturing, inverlochy, and, urquhart, castles, burning, to, the, ground, inverness, castle, and, nairn, then, unsuccessfully, threatening, elgin, on, 7, july, 1307, king, edward, i, died, leaving, bruce, opposed, by, the, king, s, son, edward, ii, transferring, operations, to, aberdeenshire, in, late, 1307, bruce, threatened, banff, before, falling, seriously, ill, probably, owing, to, the, hardships, of, the, lengthy, campaign, recovering, leaving, john, comyn, 3rd, earl, of, buchan, unsubdued, at, his, rear, bruce, returned, west, to, take, balvenie, and, duffus, castles, then, tarradale, castle, on, the, black, isle, looping, back, via, the, hinterlands, of, inverness, and, a, second, failed, attempt, to, take, elgin, bruce, finally, achieved, his, landmark, defeat, of, comyn, at, the, battle, of, inverurie, in, may, 1308, he, then, overran, buchan, and, defeated, the, english, garrison, at, aberdeen, the, harrying, of, buchan, in, 1308, was, ordered, by, bruce, to, make, sure, all, comyn, family, support, was, extinguished, buchan, had, a, very, large, population, because, it, was, the, agricultural, capital, of, northern, scotland, and, much, of, its, population, was, loyal, to, the, comyn, family, even, after, the, defeat, of, the, earl, of, buchan, most, of, the, comyn, castles, in, moray, aberdeen, and, buchan, were, destroyed, and, their, inhabitants, killed, in, less, than, a, year, bruce, had, swept, through, the, north, and, destroyed, the, power, of, the, comyns, who, had, held, vice, regal, power, in, the, north, for, nearly, one, hundred, years, how, this, dramatic, success, was, achieved, especially, the, taking, of, northern, castles, so, quickly, is, difficult, to, understand, bruce, lacked, siege, weapons, and, it, s, unlikely, his, army, had, substantially, greater, numbers, or, was, better, armed, than, his, opponents, the, morale, and, leadership, of, the, comyns, and, their, northern, allies, appeared, to, be, inexplicably, lacking, in, the, face, of, their, direst, challenge, he, then, crossed, to, argyll, and, defeated, the, isolated, macdougalls, allies, of, the, comyns, at, the, battle, of, pass, of, brander, and, took, dunstaffnage, castle, the, last, major, stronghold, of, the, comyns, and, their, allies, bruce, then, ordered, harryings, in, argyle, and, kintyre, in, the, territories, of, clan, macdougall, in, march, 1309, bruce, held, his, first, parliament, at, st, andrews, and, by, august, he, controlled, all, of, scotland, north, of, the, river, tay, the, following, year, the, clergy, of, scotland, recognised, bruce, as, king, at, a, general, council, the, support, given, him, by, the, church, in, spite, of, his, excommunication, was, of, great, political, importance, on, 1, october, 1310, bruce, wrote, edward, ii, of, england, from, kildrum, in, cumbernauld, parish, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, establish, peace, between, scotland, and, england, over, the, next, three, years, one, english, held, castle, or, outpost, after, another, was, captured, and, reduced, linlithgow, in, 1310, dumbarton, in, 1311, and, perth, by, bruce, himself, in, january, 1312, bruce, also, made, raids, into, northern, england, and, landing, at, ramsey, in, the, isle, of, man, laid, siege, to, castle, rushen, in, castletown, capturing, it, on, 21, june, 1313, and, denying, the, english, the, island, s, strategic, importance, the, eight, years, of, exhausting, but, deliberate, refusal, to, meet, the, english, on, even, ground, have, caused, many, to, consider, bruce, one, of, the, great, guerrilla, leaders, of, any, age, this, represented, a, transformation, for, one, raised, as, a, feudal, knight, by, 1314, bruce, had, recaptured, most, of, the, castles, in, scotland, held, by, the, english, and, was, sending, raiding, parties, into, northern, england, as, far, as, carlisle, in, response, edward, ii, planned, a, major, military, campaign, with, the, support, of, lancaster, and, the, barons, mustering, a, large, army, of, between, 15, 000, and, 20, 000, men, in, the, spring, of, 1314, edward, bruce, laid, siege, to, stirling, castle, a, key, fortification, in, scotland, whose, governor, philip, de, mowbray, agreed, to, surrender, if, not, relieved, before, 24, june, 1314, in, march, james, douglas, captured, roxburgh, and, randolph, captured, edinburgh, castle, bruce, later, ordered, the, execution, of, piers, de, lombard, governor, of, the, castle, while, in, may, bruce, again, raided, england, and, subdued, the, isle, of, man, news, of, the, agreement, regarding, stirling, castle, reached, the, english, king, in, late, may, and, he, decided, to, speed, his, march, north, from, berwick, to, relieve, the, castle, robert, with, between, 5, 500, and, 6, 500, troops, predominantly, spearmen, prepared, to, prevent, edward, s, forces, from, reaching, stirling, the, battle, began, on, 23, june, as, the, english, army, attempted, to, force, its, way, across, the, high, ground, of, the, bannock, burn, which, was, surrounded, by, marshland, skirmishing, between, the, two, sides, broke, out, resulting, in, the, death, of, sir, henry, de, bohun, whom, robert, killed, in, personal, combat, edward, continued, his, advance, the, following, day, and, encountered, the, bulk, of, the, scottish, army, as, they, emerged, from, the, woods, of, new, park, the, english, appear, not, to, have, expected, the, scots, to, give, battle, here, and, as, a, result, had, kept, their, forces, in, marching, rather, than, battle, order, with, the, archers, who, would, usually, have, been, used, to, break, up, enemy, spear, formations, at, the, back, rather, than, the, front, of, the, army, the, english, cavalry, found, it, hard, to, operate, in, the, cramped, terrain, and, were, crushed, by, robert, s, spearmen, the, english, army, was, overwhelmed, and, its, leaders, were, unable, to, regain, control, edward, ii, was, dragged, from, the, battlefield, hotly, pursued, by, the, scottish, forces, and, only, just, escaped, the, heavy, fighting, the, historian, roy, haines, describes, the, defeat, as, a, calamity, of, stunning, proportions, for, the, english, whose, losses, were, huge, in, the, aftermath, of, the, defeat, edward, retreated, to, dunbar, then, travelled, by, ship, to, berwick, and, then, back, to, york, in, his, absence, stirling, castle, quickly, fell, freed, from, english, threats, scotland, s, armies, could, now, invade, northern, england, bruce, also, drove, back, a, subsequent, english, expedition, north, of, the, border, and, launched, raids, into, yorkshire, and, lancashire, buoyed, by, his, military, successes, robert, also, sent, his, brother, edward, to, invade, ireland, in, 1315, in, an, attempt, to, assist, the, irish, lords, in, repelling, english, incursions, in, their, kingdoms, and, to, regain, all, the, lands, they, had, lost, to, the, crown, having, received, a, reply, to, offers, of, assistance, from, domhnall, n, ill, king, of, t, r, eoghain, and, to, open, a, second, front, in, the, continuing, wars, with, england, edward, was, even, crowned, as, high, king, of, ireland, in, 1316, robert, later, went, there, with, another, army, to, assist, his, brother, in, conjunction, with, the, invasion, bruce, popularised, an, ideological, vision, of, a, pan, gaelic, greater, scotia, with, his, lineage, ruling, over, both, ireland, and, scotland, this, propaganda, campaign, was, aided, by, two, factors, the, first, was, his, marriage, alliance, from, 1302, with, the, de, burgh, family, of, the, earldom, of, ulster, in, ireland, second, bruce, himself, on, his, mother, s, side, of, carrick, was, descended, from, gaelic, royalty, in, scotland, as, well, as, ireland, bruce, s, irish, ancestors, included, aoife, of, leinster, d, 1188, whose, ancestors, included, brian, boru, of, munster, and, the, kings, of, leinster, thus, lineally, and, geopolitically, bruce, attempted, to, support, his, anticipated, notion, of, a, pan, gaelic, alliance, between, scottish, irish, gaelic, populations, under, his, kingship, this, is, revealed, by, a, letter, he, sent, to, the, irish, chiefs, where, he, calls, the, scots, and, irish, collectively, nostra, nacio, our, nation, stressing, the, common, language, customs, and, heritage, of, the, two, peoples, whereas, we, and, you, and, our, people, and, your, people, free, since, ancient, times, share, the, same, national, ancestry, and, are, urged, to, come, together, more, eagerly, and, joyfully, in, friendship, by, a, common, language, and, by, common, custom, we, have, sent, you, our, beloved, kinsman, the, bearers, of, this, letter, to, negotiate, with, you, in, our, name, about, permanently, strengthening, and, maintaining, inviolate, the, special, friendship, between, us, and, you, so, that, with, god, s, will, our, nation, nostra, nacio, may, be, able, to, recover, her, ancient, liberty, the, diplomacy, worked, to, a, certain, extent, at, least, in, ulster, where, the, scots, had, some, support, the, irish, chief, domhnall, n, ill, for, instance, later, justified, his, support, for, the, scots, to, pope, john, xxii, by, saying, the, kings, of, lesser, scotia, all, trace, their, blood, to, our, greater, scotia, and, retain, to, some, degree, our, language, and, customs, initially, the, scot, irish, army, seemed, unstoppable, as, they, defeated, the, english, again, and, again, and, levelled, their, towns, however, the, scots, failed, to, win, over, the, non, ulster, chiefs, or, to, make, any, other, significant, gains, in, the, south, of, the, island, where, people, couldn, t, see, the, difference, between, english, and, scottish, occupation, this, was, because, a, famine, struck, ireland, and, the, army, struggled, to, sustain, itself, they, resorted, to, pillaging, and, razing, entire, settlements, as, they, searched, for, supplies, regardless, of, whether, they, were, english, or, irish, eventually, it, was, defeated, when, edward, bruce, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, faughart, the, irish, annals, of, the, period, described, the, defeat, of, the, bruces, by, the, english, as, one, of, the, greatest, things, ever, done, for, the, irish, nation, due, to, the, fact, it, brought, an, end, to, the, famine, and, pillaging, wrought, upon, the, irish, by, both, the, scots, and, the, english, the, reign, of, robert, bruce, also, included, some, significant, diplomatic, achievements, the, declaration, of, arbroath, of, 1320, strengthened, his, position, particularly, in, relation, to, the, papacy, and, pope, john, xxii, eventually, lifted, bruce, s, excommunication, in, may, 1328, king, edward, iii, of, england, signed, the, treaty, of, edinburgh, northampton, which, recognised, scotland, as, an, independent, kingdom, and, bruce, as, its, king, in, 1325, robert, i, acquired, lands, at, cardross, in, exchange, for, those, of, old, montros, in, angus, scotland, with, sir, david, graham, it, was, to, be, here, in, cardoss, that, robert, would, build, the, manor, house, that, would, serve, as, his, favoured, residence, during, the, final, years, of, his, reign, the, extant, chamberlain, s, accounts, for, 1328, detail, a, manor, house, at, cardross, with, king, s, and, queen, s, chambers, and, glazed, windows, a, chapel, kitchens, bake, and, brew, houses, falcon, aviary, medicinal, garden, gatehouse, protective, moat, and, a, hunting, park, there, was, also, a, jetty, and, beaching, area, for, the, king, s, coble, for, fishing, alongside, the, king, s, great, ship, as, most, of, mainland, scotland, s, major, royal, castles, had, remained, in, their, razed, state, since, around, 1313, 1314, cardross, manor, was, perhaps, built, as, a, modest, residence, sympathetic, to, robert, s, subjects, privations, through, a, long, war, repeated, famines, and, livestock, pandemics, before, cardross, became, habitable, in, 1327, robert, s, main, residence, had, been, scone, abbey, robert, had, been, suffering, from, a, serious, illness, from, at, least, 1327, the, lanercost, chronicle, and, scalacronica, state, that, the, king, was, said, to, have, contracted, and, died, of, leprosy, jean, le, bel, also, stated, that, in, 1327, the, king, was, a, victim, of, la, grosse, maladie, which, is, usually, taken, to, mean, leprosy, however, the, ignorant, use, of, the, term, leprosy, by, fourteenth, century, writers, meant, that, almost, any, major, skin, disease, might, be, called, leprosy, the, earliest, mention, of, this, illness, is, to, be, found, in, an, original, letter, written, by, an, eyewitness, in, ulster, at, the, time, the, king, made, a, truce, with, sir, henry, mandeville, on, 12, july, 1327, the, writer, of, this, letter, reported, that, robert, was, so, feeble, and, struck, down, by, illness, that, he, would, not, live, for, he, can, scarcely, move, anything, but, his, tongue, however, none, of, the, several, accounts, of, his, last, years, by, people, who, were, with, him, refer, to, any, sign, of, a, skin, ailment, barbour, writes, of, the, king, s, illness, that, it, began, through, a, benumbing, brought, on, by, his, cold, lying, during, the, months, of, wandering, from, 1306, to, 1309, it, has, been, proposed, alternatively, that, he, had, eczema, tuberculosis, syphilis, motor, neuron, disease, cancer, or, a, series, of, strokes, there, does, not, seem, to, be, any, evidence, as, to, what, the, king, himself, or, his, physicians, believed, his, illness, to, be, nor, is, there, any, evidence, of, an, attempt, in, his, last, years, to, segregate, the, king, in, any, way, from, the, company, of, friends, family, courtiers, or, foreign, diplomats, in, october, 1328, the, pope, finally, lifted, the, interdict, from, scotland, and, the, excommunication, of, robert, the, king, s, last, journey, appears, to, have, been, a, pilgrimage, to, the, shrine, of, saint, ninian, at, whithorn, this, was, possibly, in, search, of, a, miraculous, cure, or, to, make, his, peace, with, god, with, moray, by, his, side, robert, set, off, from, his, manor, at, cardross, for, tarbert, on, his, great, ship, thence, to, the, isle, of, arran, where, he, celebrated, christmas, of, 1328, at, the, hall, of, glenkill, near, lamlash, thence, he, sailed, to, the, mainland, to, visit, his, son, and, his, bride, both, mere, children, now, installed, at, turnberry, castle, the, head, of, the, earldom, of, carrick, and, once, his, own, main, residence, he, journeyed, overland, being, carried, on, a, litter, to, inch, in, wigtownshire, houses, were, built, there, and, supplies, brought, to, that, place, as, though, the, king, s, condition, had, deteriorated, at, the, end, of, march, 1329, he, was, staying, at, glenluce, abbey, and, at, monreith, from, where, st, ninian, s, cave, was, visited, early, in, april, he, arrived, at, the, shrine, of, st, ninian, at, whithorn, he, fasted, four, or, five, days, and, prayed, to, the, saint, before, returning, by, sea, to, cardross, barbour, and, other, sources, relate, that, robert, summoned, his, prelates, and, barons, to, his, bedside, for, a, final, council, at, which, he, made, copious, gifts, to, religious, houses, dispensed, silver, to, religious, foundations, of, various, orders, so, that, they, might, pray, for, his, soul, and, repented, of, his, failure, to, fulfil, a, vow, to, undertake, a, crusade, to, fight, the, saracens, in, the, holy, land, robert, s, final, wish, reflected, conventional, piety, and, was, perhaps, intended, to, perpetuate, his, memory, after, his, death, his, heart, was, to, be, removed, from, his, body, and, accompanied, by, a, company, of, knights, led, by, sir, james, douglas, taken, on, pilgrimage, to, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, before, being, interred, in, melrose, abbey, upon, its, return, from, the, holy, land, i, will, that, as, soone, as, i, am, trespassed, out, of, this, worlde, that, ye, take, my, harte, owte, of, my, body, and, embawme, it, and, take, of, my, treasoure, as, ye, shall, thynke, sufficient, for, that, enterprise, both, for, your, selfe, and, suche, company, as, ye, wyll, take, with, you, and, present, my, hart, to, the, holy, sepulchre, where, as, our, lorde, laye, seyng, my, body, can, nat, come, there, robert, also, arranged, for, perpetual, soul, masses, to, be, funded, at, the, chapel, of, saint, serf, at, ayr, and, at, the, dominican, friary, in, berwick, as, well, as, at, dunfermline, abbey, robert, died, on, 7, june, 1329, at, the, manor, of, cardross, near, dumbarton, apart, from, failing, to, fulfill, a, vow, to, undertake, a, crusade, he, died, utterly, fulfilled, in, that, the, goal, of, his, lifetime, s, struggle, untrammelled, recognition, of, the, bruce, right, to, the, crown, had, been, realised, and, confident, that, he, was, leaving, the, kingdom, of, scotland, safely, in, the, hands, of, his, most, trusted, lieutenant, moray, until, his, infant, son, reached, adulthood, six, days, after, his, death, to, complete, his, triumph, still, further, papal, bulls, were, issued, granting, the, privilege, of, unction, at, the, coronation, of, future, kings, of, scots, it, remains, unclear, just, what, caused, the, death, of, robert, a, month, before, his, fifty, fifth, birthday, contemporary, accusations, that, robert, had, leprosy, the, unclean, sickness, the, present, day, treatable, hansen, s, disease, derived, from, english, and, hainault, chroniclers, none, of, the, scottish, accounts, of, his, death, hint, at, leprosy, penman, states, that, it, is, very, difficult, to, accept, the, notion, of, robert, as, a, functioning, king, serving, in, war, performing, face, to, face, acts, of, lordship, holding, parliament, and, court, travelling, widely, and, fathering, several, children, all, while, displaying, the, infectious, symptoms, of, a, leper, along, with, suggestions, of, eczema, tuberculosis, syphilis, motor, neurone, disease, cancer, or, stroke, a, diet, of, rich, court, food, has, also, been, suggested, as, a, possible, contributory, factor, in, robert, s, death, his, milanese, physician, maino, de, maineri, did, criticise, the, king, s, eating, of, eels, as, dangerous, to, his, health, in, advancing, years, a, team, of, researchers, headed, by, professor, andrew, nelson, from, university, of, western, ontario, have, determined, that, robert, the, bruce, did, not, have, leprosy, they, examined, the, original, casting, of, the, skull, belonging, to, robert, the, bruce, s, descendant, lord, andrew, douglas, alexander, thomas, bruce, and, a, foot, bone, that, had, not, been, re, interred, they, determined, that, skull, and, foot, bone, showed, no, signs, of, leprosy, such, as, an, eroded, nasal, spine, and, a, pencilling, of, the, foot, bone, the, king, s, body, was, embalmed, and, his, sternum, sawn, open, to, allow, extraction, of, the, heart, which, sir, james, douglas, placed, in, a, silver, casket, to, be, worn, on, a, chain, around, his, neck, robert, s, viscera, were, interred, in, the, chapel, of, saint, serf, the, ruins, of, which, are, located, in, the, present, day, levengrove, park, in, dumbarton, his, regular, place, of, worship, and, close, to, his, manor, house, in, the, ancient, parish, of, cardross, the, king, s, body, was, carried, east, from, cardross, by, a, carriage, decked, in, black, lawn, cloth, with, stops, recorded, at, dunipace, and, cambuskenneth, abbey, the, funeral, was, a, grand, affair, with, 478, stone, 3, 040, kg, of, wax, having, been, purchased, for, the, making, of, funerary, candles, a, file, of, mourners, on, foot, including, robert, stewart, and, a, number, of, knights, dressed, in, black, gowns, accompanied, the, funeral, party, into, dunfermline, abbey, a, canopy, chapel, or, hearse, of, imported, baltic, wood, was, erected, over, the, grave, robert, i, s, body, in, a, wooden, coffin, was, then, interred, within, a, stone, vault, beneath, the, floor, underneath, a, box, tomb, of, white, italian, marble, purchased, in, paris, by, thomas, of, chartres, after, june, 1328, a, plinth, of, black, frosterley, marble, topped, this, structure, and, atop, this, plinth, was, a, white, shawl, alabaster, effigy, of, robert, i, painted, and, gilded, the, following, latin, epitaph, was, inscribed, around, the, top, of, the, tomb, hic, jacet, invictus, robertus, rex, benedictus, qui, sua, gesta, legit, repetit, quot, bella, peregit, ad, libertatem, perduxit, per, probitatem, regnum, scottorum, nunc, vivat, in, arce, polorum, here, lies, the, invincible, blessed, king, robert, whoever, reads, about, his, feats, will, repeat, the, many, battles, he, fought, by, his, integrity, he, guided, to, liberty, the, kingdom, of, the, scots, may, he, now, live, in, heaven, ten, alabaster, fragments, from, the, tomb, are, on, display, in, the, national, museum, of, scotland, and, traces, of, gilding, still, remain, on, some, of, them, robert, had, bequeathed, sufficient, funds, to, pay, for, thousands, of, obituary, masses, in, dunfermline, abbey, and, elsewhere, and, his, tomb, would, thus, be, the, site, of, daily, votive, prayers, when, a, projected, international, crusade, failed, to, materialise, sir, james, douglas, and, his, company, escorting, the, casket, containing, bruce, s, heart, sailed, to, spain, where, alfonso, xi, of, castile, was, mounting, a, campaign, against, the, moorish, kingdom, of, granada, according, to, john, barbour, douglas, and, his, companions, including, sir, william, de, keith, sir, william, st, clair, of, rosslyn, and, the, brothers, sir, robert, logan, of, restalrig, and, sir, walter, logan, were, welcomed, cordially, by, king, alfonso, in, august, 1330, the, scots, contingent, formed, part, of, the, castilian, army, besieging, the, frontier, castle, of, teba, under, circumstances, which, are, still, disputed, sir, james, and, most, of, his, companions, were, killed, the, sources, all, agree, that, outnumbered, and, separated, from, the, main, christian, army, a, group, of, scots, knights, led, by, douglas, was, overwhelmed, and, wiped, out, john, barbour, describes, how, the, surviving, members, of, the, company, recovered, douglas, body, together, with, the, casket, containing, bruce, s, heart, the, heart, together, with, douglas, bones, was, then, brought, back, to, scotland, bruce, s, dying, wish, was, that, when, he, passed, his, heart, be, removed, and, taken, to, the, holy, land, his, heart, never, made, it, though, as, all, efforts, to, take, the, heart, failed, and, so, they, brought, the, heart, back, to, scotland, where, it, was, then, buried, in, a, lead, container, at, melrose, abbey, in, roxburghshire, in, 1920, the, heart, was, discovered, by, archaeologists, and, was, reburied, but, the, location, was, not, marked, in, 1996, a, casket, was, unearthed, during, construction, work, scientific, study, by, aoc, archaeologists, in, edinburgh, demonstrated, that, it, did, indeed, contain, human, tissue, and, it, was, of, appropriate, age, it, was, reburied, in, melrose, abbey, in, 1998, pursuant, to, the, dying, wishes, of, the, king, during, the, scottish, reformation, the,

was, said, that, the, nave, was, also, in, a, sorry, state, with, the, walls, so, extensively, damaged, that, it, was, a, danger, to, enter, in, 1672, parts, of, the, east, end, collapsed, while, in, 1716, part, of, the, central, tower, is, said, to, have, fallen, presumably, destabilising, much, that, still, stood, around, its, base, and, the, east, gable, tumbled, in, 1726, the, final, collapse, of, the, central, tower, took, place, in, 1753, on, 17, february, 1818, workmen, breaking, ground, on, the, new, parish, church, to, be, built, on, the, site, of, the, choir, of, dunfermline, abbey,

vault, was, to, be, secured, from, all, further, inspection, with, new, stones, and, iron, bars, and, guarded, by, the, town, constables, and, that, once, the, walls, of, the, new, church, were, built, up, around, the, site, an, investigation, of, the, vault, and, the, remains, could, take, place, accordingly, on, 5, november, 1819, the, investigation, took, place, the, cloth, of, gold,

by, medieval, standards, was, impressive, at, this, height, he, would, have, stood, almost, as, tall, as, edward, i, 6, feet, 2, inches, 188, cm, the, skeleton, lying, on, the, wooden, coffin, board, was, then, placed, upon, the, top, of, a, lead, coffin, and, the, large, crowd, of, curious, people, who, had, assembled, outside, the, church, were, allowed, to, file, past, the, vault, to, view,

and, eventual, victory, the, story, serves, to, illustrate, the, maxim, if, at, first, you, don, t, succeed, try, try, try, again, other, versions, have, bruce, in, a, small, house, watching, the, spider, try, to, make, its, connection, between, two, roof, beams, this, legend, first, appears, in, a, much, later, account, tales, of, a, grandfather, by, walter, scott, published, between, 1828, and, 1830, this, may, have, originally, been, told, about, his, companion, in, arms, sir, james, douglas, the, black, douglas, who, had, spent, time, hiding, out, in, caves, within, his, manor, of, lintalee, which, was, then, occupied, by, the, english, the, entire, account, may, in, fact, be, a, version, of, a, literary, trope, used, in, royal, biographical, writing, a, similar, story, is,

cavalry, de, bohun, caught, sight, of, bruce, who, was, armed, only, with, his, battle, axe, de, bohun, lowered, his, lance, and, charged, and, bruce, stood, his, ground, at, the, last, moment, bruce, swiftly, dodged, the, lance, rose, in, his, saddle, and, with, one, mighty, swing, of, his, axe, struck, bohun, so, hard, that, he, split, de, bohun, s, iron, helmet, and, his, head, in, two, a, blow, so, powerful, that, it, shattered, the, very, weapon, into, pieces, afterwards, the, king, merely, expressed, regret, that, he, had, broken, the, shaft, of, his, favourite, axe, to, this, day, the,
