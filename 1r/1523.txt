from, less, threatened, positions, ludendorff, was, so, distraught, on, the, phone, to, ohl, that, general, wilhelm, groener, who, directed, the, army, s, railroads, and, had, been, a, competitor, with, ludendorff, on, the, general, staff, was, sent, to, evaluate, his, nerves, which, were, judged, satisfactory, for, a, week, the, russians, kept, attacking, they, lost, 80, 000, men, the,

that, another, attack, of, such, scale, and, ferocity, would, have, left, his, forces, faced, with, the, menace, of, a, complete, collapse, after, having, their, strength, decimated, by, the, russians, in, the, brusilov, offensive, the, austro, hungarian, forces, submitted, their, eastern, front, forces, to, hindenburg, s, command, on, 27, july, except, for, archduke, karl, s, army, group,

line, would, be, constructed, immediately, ludendorff, promised, more, arms, rupprecht, was, delighted, that, two, such, competent, men, had, replaced, the, dilettante, falkenhayn, bauer, was, impressed, that, hindenburg, saw, everything, only, with, the, eye, of, the, soldier, under, field, marshal, hindenburg, s, leadership, the, german, supreme, army, command, issued, a, textbook, of, defensive, warfare, that, recommended, fewer, defenders, in, the, front, line, relying, on, light, machine, guns, if, pushed, too, hard, they, were, permitted, to, pull, back, front, line, defenses, were, organized, so, that, penetrating, enemy, forces, found, themselves, cut, down, by, machine, gun, fire, and, artillery, from, those, who, knew, the, ranges, and, location, of, their, own, strong, points, subsequently, the, infantry, would, counterattack, while, the, attacker, s, artillery, was, blind, because, they, were, unsure, where, their, own, men, were, a, reserve, division, was, positioned, immediately, behind, the, line, if, it, entered, the, battle, it, was, commanded, by, the, division, whose, position, had, been, penetrated, mobile, defense, was, also, used, in, world, war, ii, responsibilities, were, reassigned, to, implement, the, new, tactics, front, line, commanders, took, over, reserves, ordered, into, the, battle, and, for, flexibility, infantry, platoons, were, subdivided, into, eight, man, units, under, a, noncom, field, officers, who, visited, headquarters, often, were, invited, to, speak, with, hindenburg, who, inquired, about, their, problems, and, recommendations, at, this, time, he, was, especially, curious, about, the, eight, man, units, which, he, regarded, as, the, greatest, evidence, of, the, confidence, which, we, placed, in, the, moral, and, mental, powers, of, our, army, down, to, its, smallest, unit, revised, infantry, field, regulations, were, published, and, taught, to, all, ranks, including, at, a, school, for, division, commanders, where, they, maneuvered, a, practice, division, a, monthly, periodical, informed, artillery, officers, about, new, developments, in, the, last, months, of, 1916, the, british, battering,

coordinated, by, his, artillery, commander, general, robert, nivelle, then, a, double, creeping, barrage, led, the, infantry, into, the, shattered, first, german, lines, where, the, attackers, stopped, to, repel, counterattacks, with, repeated, nibbles, by, mid, december, 1916, the, french, retook, all, the, ground, the, germans, had, paid, for, so, dearly, nivelle, was, given, command, of, the, french, army, hindenburg, s, day, at, ohl, began, at, 09, 00, when, he, and, ludendorff, discussed, the, reports, usually, quickly, agreeing, on, what, was, to, be, done, ludendorff, would, give, their, staff, of, about, 40, officers, their, assignments, while, hindenburg, walked, for, an, hour, or, so, thinking, or, chatting, with, guests, after, conferring, again, with, ludendorff, he, heard, reports, from, his, departmental, heads, met, with, visitors, and, worked, on, correspondence, at, noon, ludendorff, gave, the, situation, report, to, the, kaiser, unless, an, important, decision, was, required, when, hindenburg, took, over, he, lunched, with, his, personal, staff, which, included, a, son, in, law, who, was, an, army, officer, dinner, at, 20, 00, was, with, the, general, staff, officers, of, all, ranks, and, guests, crowned, heads, allied, leaders, politicians, industrialists, and, scientists, they, left, the, table, to, subdivide, into, informal, chatting, groups, at, 21, 30, ludendorff, announced, that, time, was, up, and, they, returned, to, work, after, a, junior, officer, summarized, the, daily, reports, he, might, confer, with, ludendorff, again, before, retiring, under, hindenburg, the, third, ohl, set, ambitious, benchmarks, for, arms, production, in, what, became, known, as, the, hindenburg, programme, which, was, directed, from, the, war, office, by, general, groener, major, goals, included, a, new, light, machine, gun, updated, artillery, and, motor, transport, but, no, tanks, because, they, considered, them, too, vulnerable, to, artillery, to, increase, output, they, needed, skilled, workers, the, army, released, a, million, men, for, total, war, the, supreme, army, command, wanted, all, german, men, and, women, from, 15, to, 60, enrolled, for, national, service, hindenburg, also, wanted, the, universities, closed, except, for, medical, training, so, that, empty, places, would, not, be, filled, by, women, to, swell, the, next, generation, of, soldiers, he, wanted, contraceptives, banned, and, bachelors, taxed, when, a, polish, army, was, being, formed, he, wanted, jews, excluded, few, of, these, ideas, were, adopted, because, their, political, maneuvering, was, vigorous, but, inept, as, admiral, m, ller, of, the, military, cabinet, observed, old, hindenburg, like, ludendorff, is, no, politician, and, the, latter, is, at, the, same, time, a, hothead, for, example, women, were, not, included, in, the, service, law, that, ultimately, passed, because, in, fact, more, women, were, already, seeking, employment, than, there, were, openings, following, the, death, of, austro, hungarian, emperor, franz, joseph, on, 21, november, hindenburg, met, his, successor, charles, who, was, frank, about, hoping, to, stop,

the, russians, and, ottomans, between, the, black, and, caspian, sea, ran, along, the, heights, of, the, caucasus, mountains, hindenburg, urged, the, ottomans, to, pull, their, men, off, the, heights, before, winter, but, they, did, not, in, his, memoirs, he, would, later, allege, this, was, because, of, their, policy, of, massacre, of, the, armenians, the, front, in, palestine, ran, from, the, mediterranean, to, the, southern, end, of, the, dead, sea, and, the, defenders, of, baghdad, had, a, flank, on, the, tigris, river, the, western, front, ran, southward, from, belgium, until, near, laon, where, it, turned, east, to, pass, verdun, before, again, turning, south, to, end, at, the, swiss, border, the, remaining, german, enclaves, in, africa, were, beyond, his, reach, an, attempt, to, resupply, them, by, dirigible, failed, the, central, powers, were, surrounded, and, outnumbered, by, the, second, quarter, of, 1917, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, were, able, to, assemble, 680, 000, more, men, in, 53, new, divisions, and, provide, them, with, an, adequate, supply, of, new, light, machine, guns, field, guns, were, increased, from, 5, 300, to, 6, 700, and, heavies, from, 3, 700, to, 4, 340, they, tried, to, foster, fighting, spirit, by, patriotic, instruction, with, lectures, and, films, to, ensure, that, a, fight, is, kept, up, against, all, agitators, croakers, and, weaklings, meanwhile, to, mitigate, the, risk, of, being, attacked, before, their, buildup, was, complete, germany, s, new, military, leadership, waged, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, on, allied,

united, states, and, other, neutrals, into, the, war, after, securing, the, dutch, and, danish, borders, hindenburg, announced, that, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, was, imperative, and, ludendorff, added, his, voice, on, 9, january, the, chancellor, was, forced, to, bow, to, their, unsound, military, judgments, ohl, moved, west, to, the, pleasant, spa, town, of, bad, kreuznach, in, southwest, germany, which, was, on, a, main, rail, line, the, kaiser, s, quarters, were, in, the, spa, building, staff, offices, were, in, the, orange, court, and, the, others, lived, in, the, hotel, buildings, in, february, a, third, army, group, was, formed, on, the, western, front, to, cover, the, front, in, alsace, lorraine, commanded, by, archduke, albrecht, of, w, rttemberg, some, effective, divisions, from, the, east, were, exchanged, for, less, competent, divisions, from, the, west, since, their, disasters, of, the, previous, year, the, russian, infantry, had, shown, no, fight, and, in, march, the, revolution, erupted, in, russia, shunning, opportunity, the, central, powers, stayed, put, hindenburg, feared, that, invaders, would, resurrect, the, heroic, resistance, of, 1812, on, the, western, front, the, third, ohl, deduced, the, german, army, s, huge, salient, between, the, valley, of, the, somme, and, laon, obviously, was, vulnerable, to, a, pincer, attack, which, indeed, the, french, were, planning, the, new, hindenburg, line, ran, across, its, base, subsequently, on, 16, march, hindenburg, authorized, operation, alberich, whereby, german, forces, were, ordered, to, move, out, all, able, bodied, inhabitants, and, portable, possessions, to, this, line, in, the, process, they, destroyed, every, building, leveled, all, roads, and, bridges, cut, down, every, tree, fouled, every, well, and, burned, every, combustible, in, 39, days, the, germans, withdrew, from, a, 1000, mi, 2, 2, 590, km, 2, area, more, ground, than, they, had, lost, to, all, allied, offensives, since, 1914, the, cautiously, following, allies, also, had, to, cope, with, booby, traps, some, exploding, a, month, later, the, new, german, front, called, the, hindenburg, line, was, 42, km, 26, mi,

germans, completely, off, the, vimy, ridge, when, the, excitable, ludendorff, became, distraught, over, such, developments, hindenburg, reportedly, calmed, his, first, quartermaster, general, by, pressing, his, hand, and, assuring, him, we, have, lived, through, more, critical, times, than, today, together, ultimately, the, british, tried, to, exploit, their, opening, with, a, futile, cavalry, charge, but, did, not, press, further, in, the, battle, s, aftermath, the, third, ohl, discovered, one, reason, behind, the, british, attack, s, success, was, that, the, sixth, army, commander, ludwig, von, falkenhausen, had, failed, to, properly, apply, their, instructions, for, a, defense, in, depth, by, keeping, reserve, troops, too, far, back, from, the, front, lines, as, a, result, of, this, failure, falkenhausen, along, with, several, staff, officers, were, stripped, of, their, command, after, the, romanov, dynasty, s, fall, from, power, russia, remained, at, war, under, the, new, revolutionary, government, led, by, alexander, kerensky, in, the, kerensky, offensive, launched, on, 1, july, the, russian, army, pushed, austro, hungarian, forces, in, galicia, on, 1, july, in, order, to, counter, this, success, six, german, divisions, mounted, a, counterattack, on, 18, july, that, tore, a, hole, through, the, russian, front, through, which, they, sliced, southward, toward, tarnopol, the, ensuing, german, advance, threatened, to, encircle, the, russian, attackers, thereby, causing, them, to, retreat, at, the, end, of, august, the, advancing, central, powers, stopped, at, the, frontier, of, moldavia, to, keep, up, the, pressure, and, to, seize, ground, he, intended, to, keep, hindenburg, shifted, north, to, the, heavily, fortified, city, of, riga, today, in, latvia, which, has, the, broad, dvina, river, as, a, moat, on, 1, september, the, eighth, army, led, by, oskar, von, hutier, attacked, bruchm, ller, s, bombardment, which, included, gas, and, smoke, shells, drove, the, defenders, from, the, far, bank, east, of, the, city, the, germans, crossed, in, barges, and, then, bridged, the, river, immediately, pressing, forward, to, the, baltic, coast, pocketing, the, defenders, of, the, riga, salient, next, a, joint, operation, with, the, navy, seized, oesel, and, two, smaller, islands, in, the, gulf, of, riga, the, bolshevik, revolution, took, russia, out,

hindenburg, and, ludendorff, to, join, them, but, when, they, arrived, the, kaiser, told, them, that, there, could, be, no, justification, for, their, presence, in, berlin, they, should, return, in, haste, to, headquarters, where, they, certainly, would, be, much, better, occupied, in, a, letter, to, the, emperor, dated, 12, july, 1917, ludendorff, threatened, to, resign, and, hindenburg, joined, in, the, ultimatum, the, kaiser, declined, to, accept, by, then, the, majority, parties, in, the, reichstag, saw, bethmann, hollweg, as, an, unacceptable, negotiator, for, peace, because, he, had, been, chancellor, too, long, and, was, too, weak, in, his, dealings, with, the, supreme, army, command, the, crisis, was, resolved, when, bethmann, hollweg, voluntarily, resigned, ludendorff, and, bauer, wanted, to, replace, both, the, kaiser, and, chancellor, with, a, dictator, but, hindenburg, would, not, agree, on, 19, july, the, reichstag, passed, the, resolution, calling, for, a, peace, of, understanding, without, territorial, acquisitions, achieved, by, force, and, violations, of, political, economic, or, financial, integrity, which, the, new, chancellor, georg, michaelis, agreed, to, interpret, the, resolution, became, advantageous, in, august, when, pope, benedict, xv, called, for, peace, the, german, response, cited, the, resolution, to, finesse, specific, questions, like, those, about, the, future, of, belgium, the, industrialists, opposed, groener, s, advocacy, of, an, excess, profits, tax, and, insistence, that, workers, take, a, part, in, company, management,

the, bloody, battlefield, take, no, thought, for, what, is, to, be, after, the, war, this, only, brings, despondency, into, our, ranks, and, strengthens, the, hopes, of, the, enemy, trust, that, germany, will, achieve, what, she, needs, to, stand, there, safe, for, all, time, trust, that, the, german, oak, will, be, given, air, and, light, for, its, free, growth, muscles, tensed, nerves,

shrouded, in, a, dense, cloud, of, poison, gas, released, from, 894, canisters, fired, simultaneously, from, simple, mortars, the, defenders, fled, before, their, masks, would, fail, the, artillery, opened, fire, several, hours, later, hitting, the, italian, reinforcements, hastening, up, to, fill, the, gap, the, attackers, swept, over, the, almost, empty, defenses, and, marched, through, the,

by, foreign, minister, richard, von, k, hlmann, who, encouraged, the, kaiser, to, listen, to, the, views, of, max, hoffmann, chief, of, staff, on, the, eastern, front, hoffmann, demurred, but, when, ordered, argued, that, it, would, be, a, mistake, to, bring, so, many, slavs, into, germany, when, only, a, small, slice, of, poland, was, needed, to, improve, defenses, ludendorff, was, outraged, that, the, kaiser, had, consulted, a, subordinate, while, hindenburg, complained, that, the, kaiser, disregards, our, opinion, in, a, matter, of, vital, importance, the, kaiser, backed, off, but, would, not, approve, ludendorff, s, order, removing, hoffmann, who, is, not, even, mentioned, in, hindenburg, s, memoir, when, the, soviets, refused, the, terms, offered, at, brest, litovsk, the,

military, control, which, put, their, workers, under, martial, law, on, 16, january, hindenburg, demanded, the, replacement, of, count, von, valentini, the, chief, of, the, civil, cabinet, the, kaiser, bridled, responding, i, do, not, need, your, parental, advice, but, nonetheless, fired, his, old, friend, the, germans, were, unable, to, tender, a, plausible, peace, offer, because, ohl, insisted, on, controlling, belgium, and, retaining, the, french, coalfields, all, of, the, central, powers, cities, were, on, the, brink, of, starvation, and, their, armies, were, on, short, rations, hindenburg, realized, that, empty, stomachs, prejudiced, all, higher, impulses, and, tended, to, make, men, indifferent, he, blamed, his, allies, hunger, on, poor, organization, and, transportation, not, realizing, that, the, germans, would, have, enough, to, eat, if, they, collected, their, harvest, efficiently, and, rationed, its, distribution, effectively, german, troops, were, in, finland, the, baltics, poland, belarus, ukraine, much, of, romania, the, crimea, and, in, a, salient, east, of, ukraine, extending, east, almost, to, the, volga, and, south, into, georgia, and, armenia, hundreds, of, thousands, of, men, were, needed, to, hold, and, police, these, conquests, more, germans, were, in, macedonia, and, in, palestine, where, the, british, were, driving, north, falkenhayn, was, replaced, by, otto, liman, von, sanders, who, had, led, the, defense, of, gallipoli, all, hindenburg, required, was, that, these, fronts, stand, firm, while, the, germans, won, in, the, west, where, now, they, outnumbered, their, opponents, he, firmly, believed, that, his, opponents, could, be, crushed, by, battlefield, defeats, regardless, of, their, far, superior, resources, offensive, tactics, were, tailored, to, the, defense, their, opponents, were, adopting, defense, in, depth, he, would, attack, the, british, because, they, were, less, skillful, than, the, french, the, crucial, blow, would, be, in, flanders, along, the, river, lys, where, the, line, was, held, by, the, portuguese, army, however, winter, mud, prevented, action, there, until, april, consequently, their, first, attack, named, michael, was, on, the, southern, part, of, the, british, line, at, a, projecting, british, salient, near, saint, quentin, schwerpunkts, would, hit, on, either, side, of, the, salient, s, apex, to, pocket, its, defenders, the, v, corps, as, an, overwhelming, display, of, german, power, additional, troops, and, skilled, commanders, like, von, hutier, were, shifted, from, the, east, army, group, von, gallwitz, was, formed, in, the, west, on, 1, february, one, quarter, of, the, western, divisions, were, designated, for, attack, to, counter, the, elastic, defense, during, the, winter, each, of, them, attended, a, four, week, course, on, infiltration, tactics, storm, troops, would, slip, through, weak, points, in, the, front, line, and, slice, through, the, battle, zone, bypassing, strong, points, that, would, be, mopped, up, by, the, mortars, flamethrowers, and, manhandled, field, guns, of, the, next, wave, as, always, surprise, was, essential, so, the, artillery, was, slipped, into, attack, positions, at, night, relying, on, camouflage, for, concealment, the, british, aerial, photographers, were, allowed, free, rein, before, d, day, there, would, be, no, preliminary, registration, fire, the, gunners, were, trained, for, map, firing, in, schools, established, by, bruchm, ller, in, the, short, intense, bombardment, each, gun, fired, in, a, precise, sequence, shifting, back, and, forth, between, different, targets, using, many, gas, shells, to, keep, defenders, immersed, in, a, toxic, cloud, on, d, day, the, air, force, would, establish, air, supremacy, and, strafe, enemy, strong, points, and, also, update, commanders, on, how, far, the, attackers, had, penetrated, signal, lamps, were, used, for, messaging, on, the, ground, headquarters, moved, close, to, the, front, and, as, soon, as, possible, would, advance, to, pre, selected, positions, in, newly, occupied, ground, ohl, moved, to, spa, belgium, while, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, were, closer, to, the, attack, at, avesnes, france, which, re, awoke, his, memories, of, occupied, france, 41, years, before, operation, michael, began, on, 21, march, the, first, day, s, reports, were, inconclusive, but, by, day, two, the, germans, knew, they, had, broken, through, some, of, the, enemy, artillery, lines, but, the, encirclement, failed, because, british, stoutness, gave, their, v, corps, time, to, slip, out, of, the, targeted, salient, on, day, four, german, forces, moved, on, into, the, open, country, and, the, kaiser, prematurely, celebrated, by, awarding, hindenburg, the, grand, cross, of, the, iron, cross, a, medal, first, created, for, von, bl, cher, as, usual, hindenburg, set, objectives, as, the, situation, evolved, south, of, the, salient, the, germans, had, almost, destroyed, the, british, fifth, army, so, they, pushed, west, to, cut, between, the, french, and, british, armies, however, they, advanced, too, slowly, through, the, broken, terrain, of, the, former, somme, battlefields, and, the, ground, devastated, when, withdrawing, the, year, before, and, because, troops, stopped, to, loot, food, and, clothing, and, the, allies, maintained, a, fluid, defensive, line, manned, by, troops, brought, up, and, supplied, by, rail, and, motor, transport, hindenburg, hoped, the, germans, would, get, close, enough, to, amiens, to, bombard, the, railways, with, heavy, artillery, but, they, were, stopped, just, short, after, having, advanced, a, maximum, of, 65, km, 40, mi, hindenburg, also, hoped, that, civilian, morale, would, crumble, because, paris, was, being, shelled, by, naval, guns, mounted, on, rail, carriages, 120, km, 75, mi, away, but, he, underestimated, french, resilience, the, allied, command, was, dismayed, french, headquarters, realized, this, much, became, clear, from, the, terrible, adventure, that, our, enemies, were, masters, of, a, new, method, of, warfare, what, was, even, more, serious, was, that, it, was, perceived, that, the, enemy, s, power, was, due, to, a, thing, that, cannot, be, improvised, the, training, of, officers, and, men, prolonging, michael, with, the, drive, west, delayed, and, weakened, the, attack, in, flanders, again, the, germans, broke, through, smashing, the, portuguese, defenders, and, forcing, the, british, from, all, of, the, ground, they, had, paid, so, dearly, for, in, 1917, however, french, support, enabled, the, british, to, save, hazebrouck, the, rail, junction, that, was, the, german, goal, to, draw, the, french, reserves, away, from, flanders, the, next, attack, was, along, the, aisne, river, where, nivelle, had, attacked, the, year, before, their, success, was, dazzling, the, defender, s, front, was, immersed, in, a, gas, cloud, fired, from, simple, mortars, within, hours, the, germans, had, reoccupied, all, the, ground, the, french, had, taken, by, weeks, of, grinding, and, they, swept, south, through, champagne, until, they, halted, for, resupply, at, the, marne, river, however, the, germans, had, lost, 977, 555, of, their, best, men, between, march, and, the, end, of, july, while, allied, ranks, were, swelling, with, americans, their, dwindling, stock, of, horses, were, on, the, verge, of, starvation, and, the, ragged, troops, thought, continually, of, food, one, of, the, most, effective, propaganda, handbills, which, the, british, showered, on, the, german, lines, listed, the, rations, received, by, prisoners, of, war, the, german, troops, resented, their, officers, better, rations, and, reports, of, the, ample, meals, at, headquarters, in, his, memoirs, ludendorff, devotes, six, pages, to, defending, officer, s, rations, and, perks, after, an, attack, the, survivors, needed, at, least, six, weeks, to, recuperate, but, now, crack, divisions, were, recommitted, much, sooner, tens, of, thousands, of, men, were, skulking, behind, the, lines, determined, to, win, hindenburg, decided, to, expand, the, salient, pointing, toward, paris, to, strip, more, defenders, from, flanders, the, attack, on, gouraud, s, french, fourth, army, followed, the, now, familiar, scenario, but, was, met, by, a, deceptive, elastic, defense, and, was, decisively, repelled, at, the, french, main, line, of, resistance, hindenburg, still, intended, to, make, a, decisive, attack, in, flanders, but, before, the, germans, could, strike, the, french, and, americans, led, by, light, tanks, smashed, through, the, right, flank, of, the, german, salient, on, the, marne, the, german, defense, was, halfhearted, they, had, lost, hindenburg, went, on, the, defensive, the, germans, withdrew, one, by, one, from, the, salients, created, by, their, victories, evacuating, the, wounded, and, supplies, and, retiring, to, shortened, lines, hindenburg, hoped, to, hold, a, line, until, their, enemies, were, ready, to, bargain, after, the, retreat, from, the, marne, ludendorff, became, distraught, shrieking, orders, and, often, in, tears, at, dinner, on, 19, july, he, responded, to, a, suggestion, of, hindenburg, s, by, shouting, i, have, already, told, you, that, is, impossible, hindenburg, led, him, from, the, room, on, 8, august, the, british, completely, surprised, the, germans, with, a, well, coordinated, attack, at, amiens, breaking, well, into, the, german, lines, most, disquieting, was, that, some, german, commanders, surrendered, their, units, and, that, reserves, arriving, at, the, front, were, taunted, for, prolonging, the, war, for, ludendorff, amiens, was, the, black, day, in, the, history, of, the, german, army, bauer, and, others, wanted, ludendorff, replaced, but, hindenburg, stuck, by, his, friend, he, knew, that, many, a, time, has, the, soldier, s, calling, exhausted, strong, characters, a, sympathetic, physician, who, was, ludendorff, s, friend, persuaded, him, to, leave, headquarters, temporarily, to, recuperate, his, breakdown, is, not, mentioned, in, hindenburg, s, or, his, own, memoirs, on, 12, august, army, group, von, boehn, was, created, to, firm, up, the, defenses, in, the, somme, sector, on, 29, september, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, told, the, incredulous, kaiser, that, the, war, was, lost, and, that, they, must, have, an, immediate, armistice, a, new, chancellor, prince, maximilian, of, baden, opened, negotiations, with, president, woodrow, wilson, who, would, deal, only, with, a, democratic, germany, prince, max, told, the, kaiser, that, he, would, resign, unless, ludendorff, was, dismissed, but, that, hindenburg, was, indispensable, to, hold, the, army, together, on, 26, october, the, kaiser, slated, ludendorff, before, curtly, accepting, his, resignation, then, rejecting, hindenburg, s, afterwards, ludendorff, refused, to, share, hindenburg, s, limousine, colonel, bauer, was, retired, hindenburg, promptly, replaced, ludendorff, with, groener, the, chief, of, staff, of, army, group, kiev, which, was, assisting, a, breakaway, ukrainian, state, to, fend, off, the, bolsheviks, while, receiving, food, and, oil, the, germans, were, losing, their, allies, in, june, the, austro, hungarians, in, italy, attacked, the, entente, lines, along, the, piave, river, but, were, repelled, decisively, on, 24, october, the, italians, crossed, the, river, in, the, battle, of, vittorio, veneto, after, a, few, days, of, resolute, resistance, the, defense, collapsed, weakened, by, the, defection, of, men, from, the, empire, s, subject, nations, and, by, starvation, the, men, in, their, sixth, army, had, an, average, weight, of, 120, lb, 54, kg, on, 14, october, austria, hungary, asked, for, an, armistice, in, italy, but, the, fighting, went, on, in, september, the, entente, and, their, greek, allies, attacked, in, macedonia, the, bulgarians, begged, for, more, germans, to, stiffen, their, troops, but, hindenburg, had, none, to, spare, many, bulgarian, soldiers, deserted, as, they, retreated, toward, home, opening, the, road, to, constantinople, the, austro, hungarians, were, pushed, back, in, serbia, albania, and, montenegro, and, signed, an, armistice, on, 3, november, the, ottomans, were, overextended, trying, to, defend, syria, while, exploiting, the, russian, collapse, to, move, into, the, caucasus, despite, hindenburg, s, urging, them, to, defend, what, they, had, the, british, and, arabs, broke, through, in, september,

fleet, on, a, last, battle, against, the, british, sailors, in, kiel, mutinied, and, set, up, workers, and, soldiers, councils, that, spread, quickly, across, germany, sparking, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, on, 8, november, hindenburg, and, the, kaiser, met, with, 39, regimental, officers, at, spa, there, he, delivered, a, situation, report, and, answered, questions, then, hindenburg, left, and, groener, asked, the, officers, to, answer, confidentially, two, questions, about, whether, their, troops, would, follow, the, kaiser, the, answers, were, decisive, the, army, would, not, the, kaiser, then, agreed, to, abdicate, without, doing, so, at, the, time, in, berlin, however, prince, max, had, already, publicly, announced, the, kaiser, s, abdication, and, his, own, resignation, and, that, the, social, democrat, leader, friedrich, ebert, was, the, new, chancellor, the, empire, had, crumbled, all, but, bloodlessly, that, evening, groener, telephoned, ebert, whom, he, knew, and, trusted, to, tell, him, that, if, the, new, government, would, fight, bolshevism, and, support, the, army, then, the, field, marshal, would, lead, a, disciplined, army, home, hindenburg, s, remaining, in, command, bolstered, the, new, government, s, position, the, withdrawal, became, more, fraught, when, the, armistice, obliged, all, german, troops, to, leave, belgium,

soldiers, council, formed, at, spa, arrived, at, ohl, they, were, greeted, politely, by, a, lieutenant, colonel, who, acknowledged, their, leadership, when, they, broached, the, march, home, he, took, them, to, the, map, room, explaining, allocation, of, roads, and, scheduling, unit, departures, billeting, and, feeding, they, agreed, that, the, existing, staffs, should, make, these, arrangements, to, oversee, the, withdrawals, ohl, transferred, headquarters, from, belgium, to, kassel, in, germany, unsure, how, their, officers, would, be, received, by, the, revolutionaries, they, were, greeted, by, the, chairman, of, the, workers, and, soldiers, councils, who, proclaimed, hindenburg, belongs, to, the, german, nation, his, staff, intended, to, billet, him, in, the, kaiser, s, palace, there, wilhelmsh, he, hindenburg, refused, because, they, did, not, have, the, kaiser, s, permission, instead, settling, into, a, humble, inn, thereby, pleasing, both, his, monarchist, staff, and, the, revolutionary, masses, in, the, west, 1, 25, million, men, and, 500, 000, horses, were, brought, home, in, the, time, allotted, hindenburg, did, not, want, to, involve, the, army, in, the, defense, of, the, new, government, against, their, civil, enemies, instead, the, army, supported, the, independent, freikorps, modeled, on, formations, used, in, the, napoleonic, wars, supplying, them, with, weapons, and, equipment, in, february, 1919, ohl, moved, east, to, kolberg, to, mount, an, offensive, against, impinging, soviet, troops, but, they, were, restrained, by, the, allied, occupation, administration, which, in, may, 1919, ordered, all, german, troops, in, the, east, home, on, 25, june, 1919, hindenburg, retired, to, hanover, once, again, he, settled, in, a, splendid, new, villa, which, was, a, gift, of, the, city, despite, his, admittedly, having, lost, the, greatest, war, in, history, victory, comes, from, movement, was, schlieffen, s, principle, for, war, hindenburg, expounded, on, schlieffen, s, ideas, as, an, instructor, and, later, applied, them, during, world, war, i, by, employing, such, tactics, retreats, and, mobile, defenses, commanded, by, hindenburg, proved, effective, and, his, schwerpunkt, attacks, broke, through, the, trench, barrier, on, the, western, front, however, they, failed, to, produce, decisive, victories, because, penetrating, forces, proved, too, slow, to, capitalize, on, their, breakthroughs, hindenburg, has, undergone, a, historical, revalution, his, teaching, of, tactics, and, years, on, the, general, staff, have, been, less, emphasised, while, he, is, remembered, as, a, commander, in, ludendorff, s, shadow, winston, churchill, in, 1923, depicted, hindenburg, as, a, figurehead, awed, by, the, mystique, of, the, general, staff, concluding, that, ludendorff, throughout, appears, as, the, uncontested, master, parkinson, stated, that, he, is, a, beloved, figurehead, while, to, stallings, he, is, an, old, military, booby, these, judgements, stem, from, ludendorff, who, was, famous, during, the, war, and, immediately, thereafter, wrote, his, comprehensive, memoir, with, himself, center, stage, hindenburg, s, less, detailed, memoir, never, disputed, his, colleague, s, claims, military, decisions, were, made, collectively, not, individually, and, it, is, less, useful, to, historians, because, it, was, written, for, general, readers, ludendorff, continued, emphasising, his, preeminence, in, print, which, hindenburg, never, disputed, publicly, others, did, though, the, ohl, officers, who, testified, before, the, reichstag, committee, investigating, the, collapse, of, 1918, agreed, that, hindenburg, was, always, in, command, he, managed, by, setting, objectives, and, appointing, capable, people, to, do, their, jobs, for, instance, giving, full, scope, to, the, intellectual, powers, of, ludendorff, these, subordinates, often, felt, he, did, little, even, though, he, was, setting, the, overall, course, ludendorff, may, have, overrated, himself, repressing, repeated, demonstrations, that, he, lacked, resilience, essential, to, command, postwar, he, displayed, poor, judgment, and, an, attraction, to, unusual, ideas, contrasting, with, his, former, commander, s, adaptation, to, changing, times, most, of, their, conferences, were, in, private, but, on, 26, july, 1918, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, seventh, army, fritz, von, lossberg, traveled, to, ohl, to, request, permission, to, withdraw, to, a, better, position, without, knocking, i, entered, ludendorff, s, office, and, found, him, loudly, arguing, with, the, field, marshal, i, assumed, it, was, over, the, situation, at, the, seventh, army, in, any, case, as, soon, as, i, entered, the, field, marshall, asked, me, to, give, my, assessment, of, the, situation, at, the, seventh, army, i, described, it, in, short, terms, and, emphasized, especially, that, based, on, my, own, observations, i, thought, the, condition, of, the, troops, was, cause, for, serious, concern, for, the, past, few, days, the, seventh, army, commanding, general, the, staff, and, i, had, all, been, recommending, a, withdrawal, from, the, increasingly, untenable, front, lines, i, told, hindenburg, that, i, had, come, to, avesenes, with, the, concurrence, of, the, seventh, army, commanding, general, to, secure, such, an, order, the, field, marshall, turned, to, ludendorff, saying, something, to, the, effect, of, now, ludendorff, make, sure, that, the, order, goes, out, immediately, he, then, left, ludendorff, s, office, rather, upset, hindenburg, s, record, as, a, commander, starting, in, the, field, at, tannenberg, then, leading, four, national, armies, culminating, with, breaking, the, trench, deadlock, in, the, west, and, then, holding, a, defeated, army, together, is, unmatched, by, other, soldiers, in, world, war, i, however, military, skill, is, only, one, component, of, the, record, in, general, the, maladroit, politics, of, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, led, directly, to, the, collapse, of, 1918, the, new, republic, held, its, first, election, on, 19, january, 1919, parties, representing, a, broad, range, of, different, constituencies, ran, candidates, and, voting, was, with, proportional, representation, so, inevitably, governments, were, formed, by, coalitions, of, parties, this, time, social, democrats, democrats, and, centrists, friedrich, ebert, was, elected, as, provisional, chancellor, then, the, elected, representatives, assembled, in, weimar, to, write, a, constitution, it, was, based, in, part, on, the, ideas, of, the, 1849, frankfurt, constitution, although, with, many, of, the, kaiser, s, powers, now, given, to, a, president, elected, for, a, term, of, seven, years, the, president, selected, the, chancellor, and, the, members, of, the, cabinet, but, with, the, crucial, stipulation, that, his, nominees, had, to, be, ratified, by, the, reichstag, which, because, of, proportional, representation, required, support, from, several, parties, the, constitution, was, adopted, on, 11, august, 1919, ebert, was, elected, as, provisional, president, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, were, written, in, secret, it, was, unveiled, on, 7, may, 1919, and, was, followed, by, an, ultimatum, either, ratify, the, treaty, or, the, allies, would, take, whatever, measures, they, deemed, necessary, to, enforce, its, terms, while, germans, of, all, political, shades, cursed, the, treaty, as, an, insult, to, the, nation, s, honor, president, ebert, was, sober, enough, to, consider, the, possibility, that, germany, would, not, be, in, a, position, to, turn, it, down, to, save, face, he, asked, hindenburg, whether, the, army, was, prepared, to, defend, against, an, allied, invasion, from, the, west, which, ebert, believed, would, be, all, but, certain, if, the, treaty, were, voted, down, if, there, was, even, the, slightest, chance, that, the, army, could, hold, out, he, promised, to, urge, rejection, of, the, treaty, under, some, prodding, from, his, chief, of, staff, groener, hindenburg, concluded, the, army, could, not, resume, the, war, under, any, circumstances, rather, than, tell, ebert, himself, he, directed, groener, to, deliver, the, army, s, recommendation, to, the, president, with, just, 19, minutes, to, spare, ebert, informed, french, premier, georges, clemenceau, that, germany, would, ratify, the, treaty, which, was, signed, on, 28, june, 1919, back, in, hanover, as, a, field, marshal, he, was, provided, with, a, staff, who, helped, with, his, still, extensive, correspondence, he, made, few, formal, public, appearances, but, the, streets, around, his, house, often, were, crowded, with, admirers, when, he, took, his, afternoon, walk, during, the, war, he, had, left, the, newspaper, reporters, to, ludendorff, now, he, was, available, he, hunted, locally, and, elsewhere, including, an, annual, chamois, hunt, in, bavaria, the, yearly, tannenberg, memorial, celebration, kept, him, in, the, public, eye, a, berlin, publisher, urged, him, to, produce, his, memoirs, which, could, educate, and, inspire, by, emphasizing, his, ethical, and, spiritual, values, his, story, and, ideas, could, be, put, on, paper, by, a, team, of, anonymous, collaborators, and, the, book, would, be, translated, immediately, for, the, worldwide, market, mein, leben, my, life, was, a, huge, bestseller, presenting, to, the, world, his, carefully, crafted, image, as, a, staunch, steadfast, uncomplicated, soldier, major, themes, were, the, need, for, germany, to, maintain, a, strong, military, as, the, school, teaching, young, german, men, moral, values, and, the, need, to, restore, the, monarchy, because, only, under, the, leadership, of, the, house, of, hohenzollern, could, germany, become, great, again, with, the, conviction, that, the, subordination, of, the, individual, to, the, good, of, the, community, was, not, only, a, necessity, but, a, positive, blessing, throughout, the, kaiser, is, treated, with, great, respect, he, concealed, his, cultural, interests, and, assured, his, readers, it, was, against, my, inclination, to, take, any, interest, in, current, politics, despite, what, his, intimates, knew, of, his, deep, knowledge, of, prussian, political, life, mein, leben, was, dismissed, by, many, military, historians, and, critics, as, a, boring, apologia, that, skipped, over, the, controversial, issues, but, it, painted, for, the, german, public, precisely, the, image, he, sought, the, treaty, required, the, german, army, to, have, no, more, than, 100, 000, men, and, abolished, the, general, staff, therefore, in, march, 1919, the, reichswehr, was, organized, the, 430, 000, armed, men, in, germany,

stand, hindenburg, read, through, a, prepared, statement, ignoring, the, chairman, s, repeated, demands, that, he, answer, questions, he, testified, that, the, german, army, had, been, on, the, verge, of, winning, the, war, in, the, autumn, of, 1918, and, that, the, defeat, had, been, precipitated, by, a, dolchsto, stab, in, the, back, by, disloyal, elements, on, the, home, front, and, unpatriotic, politicians, quoting, a, dinner, conversation, that, ludendorff, had, had, with, sir, neill, malcolm, when, his, reading, was, finished, hindenburg, walked, out, of, the, hearings, despite, being, threatened, with, contempt, sure, that, they, would, not, dare, charge, a, war, hero, his, testimony, introduced, the, dolchsto, legende, which, was, adopted, by, nationalist, and, conservative, politicians, who, sought, to, blame, the, socialist, founders, of, the, weimar, republic, for, losing, the, war, reviews, in, the, german, press, that, grossly, misrepresented, general, frederick, maurice, s, book, about, the, last, months, of, the, war, firmed, up, this, myth, ludendorff, had, used, these, reviews, to, convince, hindenburg, a, 1929, film, glorifying, his, life, as, a,

s, indecision, they, decided, on, hindenburg, despite, his, advanced, age, and, fear, notably, by, foreign, minister, stresemann, of, unfavorable, reactions, by, their, former, enemies, a, delegation, came, to, his, home, on, 1, april, he, stated, his, reservations, but, concluded, if, you, feel, that, my, election, is, necessary, for, the, sake, of, the, fatherland, i, ll, run, in, god, s, name, however, some, parties, on, the, right, still, opposed, him, not, willing, to, be, humiliated, like, ludendorff, he, drafted, a, telegram, declining, the, nomination, but, before, it, was, sent, admiral, alfred, von, tirpitz, and, a, young, leader, of, the, agrarian, nobility, of, eastern, germany, arrived, in, hanover, to, persuade, him, to, wait, until, the, strength, of, his, support, was, clearer, his, conservative, opponents, gave, way, so, he, consented, on, 9, april, again, he, obtained, wilhelm, ii, s, approval, his, campaign, stressed, his, devotion, to, social, justice, religious, equality, genuine, peace, at, home, and, abroad, no, war, no, internal, uprising, can, emancipate, our, chained, nation, which, is, unfortunately, split, by, dissension, he, addressed, only, one, public, meeting, held, in, hanover, and, gave, one, radio, address, on, 11, april, calling, for, a, volksgemeinschaft, national, community, under, his, leadership, the, second, election, held, on, 26, april, 1925, required, only, a, plurality, which, he, obtained, thanks, to, the, support, of, the, bavarian, people, s, party, bvp, which, had, switched, from, marx, and, by, the, refusal, of, the, communists, to, withdraw, their, candidate, ernst, th, lmann, in, the, uk, and, france, the, victory, of, the, aged, field, marshal, was, accepted, with, equanimity, hindenburg, took, office, on, 12, may, 1925, offering, my, hand, in, this, hour, to, every, german, he, moved, into, the, elegant, presidential, palace, on, the, wilhelmstrasse, accompanied, by, oskar, his, military, liaison, officer, and, oskar, s, wife, and, three, children, the, new, president, always, a, stickler, about, uniforms, soon, had, the, servants, wear, new, regalia, with, the, shoe, buckles, appropriate, for, a, court, nearby, was, the, chancellery, which, during, hindenburg, s, tenure, would, have, seven, residents, the, president, also, enjoyed, a, shooting, preserve, he, notified, chancellor, hans, luther, that, he, would, replace, the, head, of, ebert, s, presidential, staff, dr, otto, meissner, with, his, own, man, because, the, cabinet, would, have, to, consent, meissner, was, kept, on, temporarily, he, proved, invaluable, and, was, hindenburg, s, right, hand, throughout, his, presidency, foreign, minister, stresemann, had, vacationed, during, the, campaign, so, as, not, to, tarnish, his, reputation, with, the, victors, by, supporting, the, field, marshal, the, far, right, detested, stresemann, for, promoting, friendly, relations, with, the, victors, at, their, first, meeting, hindenburg, listened, attentively, and, was, persuaded, that, stresemann, s, strategy, was, correct, he, was, cooler, at, their, next, reacting, to, rightist, backlash, nonetheless, he, supported, the, government, s, policy, so, on, 1, december, 1925, the, locarno, treaties, were, signed, a, significant, step, in, restoring, germany, s, position, in, europe, the, right, was, infuriated, because, the, treaty, accepted, the, loss, of, alsace, and, lorraine, though, it, mandated, the, withdrawal, of, the, allied, troops, occupying, the, rhineland, the, president, always, was, lobbied, intensely, by, visitors, and, letter, writers, hindenburg, countered, demands, to, restore, the, monarchy, by, arguing, that, restoring, a, hohenzollern, would, block, progress, in, revising, versailles, he, accepted, the, republic, as, the, mechanism, for, restoring, germany, s, position, in, europe, though, hindenburg, was, no, vernunftrepublikaner, republican, by, reason, because, democracy, was, incompatible, with, the, militaristic, volksgemeinschaft, national, community, that, would, unite, the, people, into, one, for, future, conflicts, the, treaty, ended, luther, s, government, so, hindenburg, had, to, assemble, its, replacement, the, president, could, not, command, but, had, to, practice, politics, in, the, raw, painstakingly, listening, to, and, negotiating, with, party, leaders, to, put, together, a, bloc, with, a, majority, occasionally, he, was, able, to, seal, a, deal, as, the, revered, old, field, marshal, by, appealing, to, patriotism, after, weeks, of, negotiations, luther, formed, a, new, government, with, a, cabinet, drawn, from, the, middle, of, the, road, parties, retaining, stresemann, which, the, reichstag, approved, when, threatened, that, otherwise, the, president, would, call, new, elections, that, government, was, toppled, by, dispute, over, flying, the, old, imperial, flag, alongside, of, the, weimar, colors, which, symbolically, downgraded, the, republic, marx, was, recalled, as, chancellor, in, a, government, that, continued, the, dual, flag, policy, the, next, major, issue, was, the, properties, of, the, former, kings, now, held, by, the, states, the, question, was, whether, former, rulers, should, receive, some, compensation, or, none, more, than, 12, million, voters, petitioned, for, a, referendum, on, this, issue, meanwhile, the, reichstag, was, debating, an, expropriation, bill, hindenburg, s, impulse, was, to, resign, so, that, he, might, express, his, opposition, but, instead, meissner, persuaded, him, to, write, a, personal, letter, which, appeared, in, the, newspapers, opposing, expropriation, the, referendum, on, 20, june, 1926, rejected, expropriation, hindenburg, urged, the, states, to, reach, fair, settlements, promptly, otherwise, he, would, resign, stresemann, s, position, in, successive, governments, was, solidified, when, he, shared, the, nobel, peace, prize, for, 1926, the, next, crisis, came, in, the, autumn, of, 1926, when, reichswehr, commander, seeckt, without, consulting, the, reichswehr, minister, invited, the, eldest, son, of, the, ex, crown, prince, to, attend, maneuvers, to, keep, the, government, in, office, hindenburg, pressured, seeckt, to, resign, his, successor, was, wilhelm, heye, the, social, democrats, shifted, their, stance, and, were, willing, to, join, a, centrist, government, which, would, strengthen, it, hindenburg, was, agreeable, but, then, the, socialists, demanded, a, completely, new, cabinet, which, the, government, rejected, consequently, the, reichstag, voted, no, confidence, after, oratory, that, made, much, of, the, secret, collaboration, between, the, reichswehr, and, the, red, army, which, had, been, revealed, in, british, newspapers, to, counter, these, attacks, the, reichswehr, relied, on, colonel, kurt, von, schleicher, who, had, served, with, oskar, in, the, third, guards, and, was, often, a, guest, at, the, palace, he, assiduously, strove, to, improve, relations, with, the, republic, again, hindenburg, was, saddled, with, finding, a, new, government, he, asked, marx, to, bring, in, more, parties, the, german, nationals, agreed, to, join, and, a, new, government, was, in, place, on, 31, january, 1927, it, legislated, the, eight, hour, day, and, unemployment, insurance, on, 18, september, 1927, hindenburg, spoke, at, the, dedication, of, the, massive, memorial, at, tannenberg, outraging, international, opinion, by, denying, germany, s, responsibility, for, initiating, world, war, i, thereby, repudiating, article, 231, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, he, declared, that, germany, entered, the, war, as, the, means, of, self, assertion, against, a, world, full, of, enemies, pure, in, heart, we, set, off, to, the, defence, of, the, fatherland, and, with, clean, hands, the, german, army, carried, the, sword, his, words, were, much, stronger, than, in, the, draft, approved, by, stresemann, the, allied, governments, retaliated, by, not, congratulating, him, on, his, eightieth, birthday, he, was, more, upset, by, ludendorff, s, refusal, to, have, any, contact, at, the, ceremony, most, germans, did, celebrate, his, birthday, his, present, was, neudeck, the, ancestral, east, prussian, estate, of, the, hindenburgs, purchased, with, funds, from, a, public, subscription, later, it, became, known, that, the, title, was, in, oskar, s, name, to, avoid, potential, inheritance, tax, a, financial, scandal, in, the, navy, led, to, the, resignation, of, the, defense, minister, as, his, replacement, schleicher, wanted, groener, whose, chief, of, staff, he, had, been, late, in, the, war, the, right, strongly, opposed, him, but, the, reichstag, approved, groener, in, turn, enhanced, schleicher, s, role, in, the, army, the, reichstag, s, four, year, term, was, coming, to, an, end, so, hindenburg, pressed, it, to, promptly, pass, required, legislation, and, then, dissolved, it, on, 31, march, 1928, his, leadership, was, widely, applauded, the, election, on, 20, may, 1928, produced, a, shift, to, the, left, although, a, handful, of, nazis, were, elected, however, it, was, difficult, to, assemble, a, new, government, because, several, parties, were, reluctant, to, participate, finally, sufficient, support, was, found, for, the, social, democrat, hermann, m, ller, whom, hindenburg, found, clever, and, agreeable, later, telling, groener, that, m, ller, was, his, best, chancellor, the, next, crisis, followed, stresemann, s, negotiation, of, the, young, plan, which, rescheduled, reparations, payments, and, opened, the, way, for, needed, american, loans, in, addition, the, french, promised, to, leave, the, rhineland, in, 1930, five, years, before, schedule, the, right, formed, a, committee, to, block, adoption, which, started, by, intensively, lobbying, hindenburg, using, such, powerful, voices, as, that, of, admiral, tirpitz, hindenburg, did, not, budge, from, his, refusal, to, support, the, campaign, the, committee, brought, mainstream, conservatives, such, as, the, powerful, newspaper, owner, alfred, hugenberg, into, alliance, with, the, nazis, for, the, first, time, they, submitted, the, issue, to, a, national, plebiscite, which, failed, because, only, 15, of, eligible, voters, cast, a, ballot, far, short, of, the, 50, required, in, his, open, letter, when, he, promulgated, the, required, legislation, to, put, the, issue, before, the, voters, hindenburg, pointed, out, that, their, major, problem, was, the, economic, turmoil, and, growing, unemployment, stemming, from, the, worldwide, depression, his, close, advisers, were, oskar, groener, meissner, and, schleicher, known, as, the, kamarilla, the, younger, hindenburg, the, constitutionally, unforeseen, son, of, the, president, controlled, access, to, the, president, hindenburg, tried, to, assemble, the, next, government, by, obtaining, enough, support, from, political, parties, while, retaining, essential, ministers, such, as, groener, and, stresemann, but, was, unable, to, form, a, working, combination, the, parties, were, too, diverse, and, divided, a, new, election, would, only, reinforce, these, bitter, divisions, schleicher, proposed, a, solution, a, government, in, which, the, chancellor, would, be, responsible, to, the, president, rather, than, the, reichstag, based, on, the, so, called, 25, 48, 53, formula, named, for, the, three, articles, of, the, constitution, that, could, make, such, a, presidential, government, possible, schleicher, suggested, that, in, such, a, presidential, government, the, trained, economist, and, leader, of, the, catholic, center, party, zentrum, heinrich, br, ning, would, make, an, excellent, chancellor, hindenburg, first, talked, with, br, ning, in, february, 1930, he, was, impressed, by, his, probity, and, by, his, outstanding, combat, record, as, a, machine, gun, officer, and, was, reconciled, to, his, being, a, catholic, in, january, 1930, meissner, told, kuno, von, westarp, that, soon, muller, s, grand, coalition, would, be, replaced, by, a, presidential, government, that, would, exclude, the, social, democrats, adding, that, the, coming, hindenburg, government, would, be, anti, marxist, and, anti, parliamentarian, serving, as, a, transition, to, a, dictatorship, schleicher, maneuvered, to, exacerbate, a, bitter, dispute, within, m, ller, s, coalition, which, was, divided, over, whether, the, unemployment, insurance, rate, should, be, raised, by, a, half, percentage, point, or, a, full, percentage, point, with, the, grand, coalition, government, lacking, support, in, the, reichstag, m, ller, asked, hindenburg, to, have, his, budget, approved, under, article, 48, but, schleicher, persuaded, hindenburg, to, refuse, m, ller, s, government, fell, on, 27, march, 1930, and, br, ning, became, chancellor, br, ning, had, hesitated, because, he, lacked, parliamentary, support, but, hindenburg, appealed, to, his, sense, of, duty, and, threatened, to, resign, himself, only, the, four, social, democrats, in, the, previous, cabinet, were, replaced, forming, what, the, press, labeled, the, hindenburg, cabinet, which, dorpalen, argues, failed, to, produce, the, hoped, for, turn, of, events, the, depression, grew, worse, unemployment, was, soaring, and, now, the, constitutional, system, had, been, drastically, shaken, urged, on, by, the, president, the, reichstag, passed, a, bill, supporting, agriculture, by, raising, tariffs, and, providing, subsidies, faced, with, declining, tax, revenues, and, mounting, costs, for, unemployment, insurance, br, ning, introduced, an, austerity, budget, with, steep, spending, cuts, and, steep, tax, increases, the, young, plan, required, such, a, balanced, budget, nonetheless, his, budget, was, defeated, in, the, reichstag, in, july, 1930, so, hindenburg, signed, it, into, law, by, invoking, article, 48, the, reichstag, voted, to, repeal, the, budget, so, hindenburg, dissolved, it, just, two, years, into, its, mandate, and, re, approved, the, budget, with, article, 48, unemployment, was, still, soaring, hindenburg, took, no, part, in, the, campaign, in, the, september, 1930, elections, the, nazis, achieved, an, electoral, breakthrough, gaining, 17, percent, of, the, vote, to, become, the, second, strongest, party, in, the, reichstag, the, communists, also, made, striking, gains, albeit, not, so, great, after, the, elections, br, ning, continued, to, govern, largely, through, article, 48, his, government, was, kept, afloat, by, the, social, democrats, who, voted, against, canceling, his, article, 48, bills, in, order, to, avoid, another, election, that, could, only, benefit, the, nazis, and, the, communists, the, german, historian, eberhard, j, ckel, concluded, that, presidential, government, was, within, the, letter, of, the, constitution, but, violated, its, spirit, as, article, 54, stated, the, chancellor, and, his, cabinet, were, responsible, to, the, reichstag, and, thus, presidential, government, was, an, end, run, around, the, constitution, hindenburg, for, his, part, grew, increasingly, annoyed, with, br, ning, complaining, that, he, was, growing, tired, of, using, article, 48, all, the, time, to, pass, bills, hindenburg, found, the, detailed, notes, that, br, ning, submitted, explaining, the, economic, necessity, of, each, of, his, bills, to, be, incomprehensible, br, ning, continued, with, austerity, a, decree, in, december, 1930, once, again, cut, the, wages, of, public, employees, and, the, budget, modest, withdrawn, br, ning, was, completely, unable, to, explain, his, measures, to, the, voters, or, even, to, the, president, who, relied, on, explanations, from, the, kamarilla, the, nazis, and, german, nationals, marched, out, of, the, reichstag, in, opposition, to, a, procedural, rule, the, 1931, budget, was, then, passed, easily, and, the, reichstag, adjourned, until, october, after, only, increasing, the, military, budget, and, the, subsidies, for, junkers, in, the, so, called, osthilfe, eastern, aid, program, in, june, 1931, there, was, a, banking, crisis, in, which, the, funds, on, deposit, plummeted, complete, disaster, was, averted, by, united, states, president, herbert, hoover, obtaining, a, temporary, moratorium, on, reparation, payments, in, the, summer, of, 1931, hindenburg, complained, in, a, letter, to, his, daughter, what, pains, and, angers, me, the, most, is, being, misunderstood, by, part, of, the, political, right, he, met, adolf, hitler, for, the, first, time, in, october, 1931, at, a, high, level, conference, in, berlin, everyone, present, saw, that, they, took, an, immediate, dislike, to, each, other, afterwards, hindenburg, in, private, often, disparagingly, referred, to, hitler, as, that, austrian, corporal, that, bohemian, corporal, or, sometimes, simply, as, the, corporal, and, also, derided, hitler, s, austrian, dialect, for, his, part, hitler, often, labeled, hindenburg, as, that, old, fool, or, that, old, reactionary, on, 26, january, 1933, hindenburg, privately, told, a, group, of, his, friends, gentlemen, i, hope, you, will, not, hold, me, capable, of, appointing, this, austrian, corporal, to, be, reich, chancellor, hindenburg, made, it, clear, that, he, saw, himself, as, the, leader, of, the, national, forces, and, expected, hitler, to, follow, his, lead, in, foreign, affairs, he, spoke, with, hostility, towards, poland, often, expressing, a, hope, that, the, polish, state, would, disappear, from, the, map, of, europe, at, an, appropriate, moment, by, january, 1932, at, the, age, of, 84, hindenburg, was, vacillating, about, running, for, a, second, term, br, ning, recalled, that, once, the, president, came, to, meet, him, at, the, railway, station, but, failed, to, recognize, him, on, the, other, hand, franz, von, papen, a, later, chancellor, found, that, despite, minor, lapses, the, president, remained, competent, until, his, last, days, hindenburg, was, persuaded, to, run, by, the, kamarilla, and, supported, by, the, centre, party, the, deutsche, volkspartei, dvp, and, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, spd, which, regarded, him, as, the, only, hope, of, defeating, hitler, his, fighting, spirit, was, evoked, by, nazi, taunts, when, he, appeared, in, public, and, in, a, few, weeks, three, million, germans, signed, a, petition, urging, him, to, carry, on, br, ning, proposed, to, the, reichstag, that, in, light, of, the, still, escalating, economic, disaster, now, some, of, the, largest, banks, had, failed, the, election, should, be, postponed, for, two, years, which, would, have, required, a, two, thirds, assent, to, which, the, nazis, would, never, agree, hitler, was, to, be, one, of, his, opponents, in, the, election, hindenburg, left, most, campaigning, to, others, in, his, single, radio, address, he, stressed, the, need, for, unity, i, recall, the, spirit, of, 1914, and, the, mood, at, the, front, which, asked, about, the, man, and, not, about, his, class, or, party, hitler, campaigned, vigorously, throughout, germany, in, the, first, round, of, voting, in, march, 1932, hindenburg, was, front, runner, but, failed, to, gain, the, required, majority, in, the, runoff, the, following, month, hindenburg, won, with, 53, percent, of, the, vote, however, he, was, disappointed, because, he, lost, voters, from, the, right, only, winning, by, the, support, of, those, who, had, strongly, opposed, him, seven, years, before, he, wrote, despite, all, the, blows, in, the, neck, i, have, taken, i, will, not, abandon, my, efforts, for, a, healthy, move, to, the, right, he, called, in, the, party, leaders, for, advice, during, the, meetings, meissner, led, the, discussions, while, hindenburg, would, only, speak, briefly, on, crucial, points, schleicher, took, the, lead, in, choosing, the, cabinet, in, which, he, was, reichswehr, minister, groener, was, now, even, more, unpopular, to, the, right, because, he, had, banned, wearing, party, uniforms, in, public, on, 13, may, 1932, schleicher, told, groener, that, he, had, lost, the, confidence, of, the, army, and, must, resign, at, once, once, groener, was, gone, the, ban, was, lifted, and, the, nazi, brownshirts, were, back, battling, on, the, streets, to, cope, with, mounting, unemployment, br, ning, desperately, wanted, an, emergency, decree, to, launch, a, program, in, which, bankrupt, estates, would, be, carved, up, into, small, farms, and, turned, over, to, unemployed, settlers, when, they, met, hindenburg, read, a, statement, that, there, would, be, no, further, decrees, and, insisted, that, the, cabinet, resign, and, that, there, must, be, a, turn, to, the, right, br, ning, resigned, on, 1, june, 1932, he, was, succeeded, as, chancellor, by, papen, from, the, centre, party, who, was, schleicher, s, choice, hindenburg, did, not, even, ask, the, party, leaders, for, advice, he, was, delighted, with, papen, a, rich, smooth, aristocrat, who, had, been, a, famous, equestrian, and, a, general, staff, officer, he, soon, became, a, hindenburg, family, friend, schleicher, was, no, longer, welcomed, because, he, had, quarreled, with, oskar, the, president, was, delighted, to, find, that, eight, members, of, the, new, cabinet, had, served, as, officers, during, the, war, the, social, democratic, government, of, the, state, of, prussia, was, a, caretaker, because, it, had, lost, its, mandate, in, the, preceding, election, in, his, new, role, as, chancellor, papen, accused, it, of, failing, to, maintain, public, order, and, removed, it, as, the, prussian, government, on, 20, july, in, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, prussian, coup, d, tat, the, national, elections, came, eleven, days, later, eight, parties, received, substantial, numbers, of, votes, but, those, supporting, the, government, lost, strength, while, opponents, on, the, right, and, left, gained, the, nazis, polled, almost, the, same, 37, percent, they, had, in, the, presidential, election, making, them, the, largest, party, in, the, reichstag, schleicher, negotiated, with, them, proposing, that, hitler, become, vice, chancellor, hitler, demanded, the, chancellorship, along, with, five, cabinet, positions, and, important, posts, in, the, state, governments, additionally, the, reichstag, would, have, to, pass, an, enabling, act, giving, a, new, government, all, needed, powers, otherwise, it, would, be, dissolved, around, the, country, nazi, stormtroopers, were, running, riot, attacking, their, political, opponents, hindenburg, refused, to, make, hitler, chancellor, so, he, met, with, hitler, to, explain, that, he, was, unwilling, to, bring, a, single, party, to, power, concluding, with, i, want, to, extend, my, hand, to, you, as, a, fellow, soldier, the, following, morning, he, left, for, neudeck, most, of, the, newspapers, praised, his, defense, of, the, constitution, the, constitution, mandated, a, new, election, within, sixty, days, but, owing, to, the, crisis, hindenburg, postponed, it, papen, published, an, economic, recovery, plan, that, almost, all, of, the, parties, and, the, labor, unions, lambasted, his, scant, support, crumbled, further, to, add, enough, votes, to, gain, a, parliamentary, mandate, schleicher, tried, to, persuade, some, of, the, nazi, leaders, like, the, war, hero, hermann, g, ring, to, defect, and, to, take, a, position, in, his, government, none, of, them, would, so, he, became, another, presidential, chancellor, still, courting, prominent, nazis, otherwise, his, days, as, chancellor, were, numbered, papen, continued, to, negotiate, with, hitler, who, moderated, his, conditions, he, would, settle, for, the, chancellorship, the, reich, commissioner, of, prussia, and, two, cabinet, positions, interior, and, a, new, slot, for, aviation, he, also, promised, that, he, would, respect, the, rights, of, the, president, the, reichstag, and, the, press, and, papen, would, be, vice, chancellor, on, these, terms, hindenburg, allowed, oskar, and, meissner, to, meet, secretly, with, hitler, culminating, in, an, hour, s, t, te, t, te, between, hitler, and, oskar, schleicher, learned, of, the, secret, meeting, and, the, following, morning, met, with, the, president, to, demand, emergency, powers, and, the, dissolution, of, the, reichstag, hindenburg, refused, the, powers, but, agreed, to, the, election, before, a, new, government, could, be, formed, hindenburg, called, general, werner, von, blomberg, an, opponent, of, schleicher, back, from, a, disarmament, conference, and, appointed, him, reichswehr, minister, perhaps, unaware, that, he, was, a, nazi, sympathizer, to, break, the, stalemate, hindenburg, proposed, hitler, as, chancellor, papen, as, vice, chancellor, and, reich, commissioner, of, prussia, and, g, ring, as, prussian, interior, minister, who, controlled, the, police, two, other, cabinet, ministers, would, be, nazis, the, remaining, eight, would, be, from, other, parties, when, hindenburg, met, with, hitler, papen, would, always, be, present, the, new, cabinet, included, only, three, nazis, hitler, g, ring, and, wilhelm, frick, besides, hitler, frick, was, the, only, nazi, with, a, portfolio, he, held, the, nearly, powerless, interior, ministry, unlike, the, rest, of, europe, at, the, time, the, interior, ministry, had, no, power, over, the, police, which, was, the, responsibility, of, the, l, nder, g, ring, did, not, receive, a, portfolio, but, critically, was, made, prussian, interior, minister, controlling, the, largest, police, force, in, which, he, promoted, nazis, as, commanders, blomberg, was, reichswehr, minister, hugenberg, was, both, economics, and, agriculture, minister, and, seldte, the, leader, of, the, first, world, war, ex, servicemen, s, organization, der, stahlhelm, was, labor, minister, the, other, ministers, were, holdovers, from, the, papen, and, schleicher, cabinets, hitler, s, first, act, as, chancellor, was, to, ask, hindenburg, to, dissolve, the, reichstag, so, that, the, nazis, and, deutschnationale, volkspartei, german, nationalists, or, dnvp, could, win, an, outright, majority, to, pass, the, enabling, act, that, would, give, the, new, government, power, to, rule, by, decree, supposedly, for, the, next, four, years, unlike, laws, passed, by, article, 48, which, could, be, cancelled, by, a, majority, in, the, reichstag, under, the, enabling, act, the, chancellor, could, pass, laws, by, decree, that, could, not, be, cancelled, by, a, vote, in, the, reichstag, hindenburg, agreed, to, this, request, in, early, february, 1933, papen, asked, for, and, received, an, article, 48, bill, signed, into, law, that, sharply, limited, freedom, of, the, press, after, the, reichstag, fire, on, 27, february, hindenburg, at, hitler, s, urging, signed, into, law, the, reichstag, fire, decree, via, article, 48, which, effectively, suspended, all, civil, liberties, in, germany, g, ring, as, prussian, interior, minister, had, enlisted, thousands, of, sturmabteilung, sa, men, as, auxiliary, policemen, who, attacked, political, opponents, of, the, nazis, with, communists, and, social, democrats, being, singled, out, for, particular, abuse, fritz, sch, ffer, a, conservative, catholic, and, a, leading, politician, of, the, bavarian, people, s, party, met, hindenburg, on, 17, february, 1933, to, complain, about, the, ongoing, campaign, of, terror, against, the, spd, sch, ffer, told, hindenburg, we, reject, the, notion, that, millions, of, germans, are, not, to, be, designated, as, national, the, socialists, served, in, the, trenches, and, will, serve, in, the, trenches, again, they, voted, for, the, banner, of, hindenburg, i, know, many, socialists, who, have, earned, acclaim, for, their, service, to, germany, i, need, only, mention, the, name, of, ebert, hindenburg, who, had, always, hated, the, social, democrats, rejected, sch, ffer, s, appeal, saying, that, the, spd, were, traitors, who, had, stabbed, the, fatherland, in, the, back, in, 1918, and, who, could, never, belong, to, the, volksgemeinschaft, therefore, the, nazis, had, his, full, support, in, their, campaign, against, the, social, democrats, hindenburg, disliked, hitler, but, he, approved, of, his, efforts, to, create, the, volksgemeinschaft, for, hindenburg, the, government, of, national, concentration, headed, by, hitler, was, the, fulfillment, of, what, he, had, been, seeking, since, 1914, the, creation, of, the, volksgemeinschaft, despite, the, ensuing, anti, red, hysteria, the, nazis, received, only, 44, of, the, vote, though, with, the, support, of, the, dnvp, they, had, a, majority, in, the, reichstag, hitler, soon, obtained, hindenburg, s, confidence, promising, that, after, germany, regained, full, sovereignty, the, monarchy, would, be, restored, after, a, few, weeks, hindenburg, no, longer, asked, papen, to, join, their, meetings, the, opening, of, the, new, reichstag, was, celebrated, with, a, nazi, extravaganza, hindenburg, descended, into, the, crypt, of, the, old, garrison, church, in, potsdam, to, commune, with, the, spirit, of, frederick, the, great, at, his, grave, attended, by, hitler, who, saluted, the, president, as, the, custodian, of, the, new, rise, of, our, people, an, enabling, act, was, prepared, that, transferred, law, making, from, the, reichstag, to, the, government, even, if, the, new, laws, violated, the, constitution, with, the, communist, deputies, and, many, social, democrats, kept, out, of, the, chamber, in, violation, of, articles, 36, and, 37, of, the, constitution, the, reichstag, passed, the, act, with, well, more, than, the, needed, two, thirds, majority, effectively, ending, the, republic, as, it, turned, out, that, meeting, took, place, in, such, an, intimidating, atmosphere, that, the, enabling, act, would, have, garnered, the, required, supermajority, even, with, all, deputies, present, and, voting, during, 1933, and, 1934, hitler, was, very, aware, that, hindenburg, was, the, only, check, on, his, power, with, the, passage, of, the, enabling, act, and, the, banning, of, all, parties, except, the, nazis, hindenburg, s, power, to, sack, the, chancellor, was, the, only, means, by, which, hitler, could, be, legally, removed, from, office, given, that, hindenburg, was, still, a, popular, war, hero, and, a, revered, figure, in, the, reichswehr, there, was, little, doubt, that, the, reichswehr, would, side, with, hindenburg, if, he, ever, decided, to, sack, hitler, thus, as, long, as, hindenburg, was, alive, hitler, was, always, very, careful, to, avoid, offending, him, or, the, army, although, hindenburg, was, in, increasingly, bad, health, the, nazis, made, sure, that, whenever, hindenburg, did, appear, in, public, it, was, in, hitler, s, company, during, these, appearances, hitler, always, made, a, point, of, showing, him, the, utmost, respect, and, deference, economic, austerity, was, abandoned, as, hitler, poured, money, into, new, programs, hiring, the, unemployed, buying, armaments, and, building, infrastructure, especially, roads, and, autobahns, within, a, year, unemployment, fell, by, almost, 40, hitler, gained, the, support, of, the, armed, forces, by, promising, to, rebuild, their, strength, the, german, states, were, taken, over, by, the, national, government, the, labor, unions, were, suppressed, political, opponents, were, imprisoned, and, jews, were, ejected, from, the, civil, service, which, included, the, universities, hindenburg, only, objected, about, the, treatment, of, jews, he, wanted, war, veterans, retained, to, which, hitler, acceded, when, hitler, moved, to, eject, hugenberg, from, the, cabinet, and, to, suppress, the, political, parties, a, trusted, colleague, of, hugenberg, s, was, sent, to, neudeck, to, appeal, for, assistance, but, only, met, with, oskar, hindenburg, delayed, the, appointment, of, one, nazi, gauleiter, but, failed, to, obtain, the, installation, of, a, lutheran, bishop, he, favored, the, honor, guard, at, neudeck, now, were, storm, troopers, on, 27, august, at, the, stirring, ceremonies, at, tannenberg, the, president, was, presented, with, two, large, east, prussian, properties, near, neudeck, on, the, night, before, the, plebiscite, on, nazi, rule, scheduled, for, 11, november, 1933, hindenburg, appealed, to, the, voters, to, support, their, president, and, their, chancellor, 95, 1, of, those, voting, did, so, when, a, new, commander, of, the, army, was, to, be, appointed, the, president, s, choice, won, out, over, the, chancellor, s, but, hindenburg, accepted, a, change, in, the, military, oath, that, eliminated, obedience, to, the, president, and, placed, the, swastika, on, military, uniforms, by, summer, 1934, hindenburg, was, dying, of, metastasized, bladder, cancer, and, his, correspondence, was, dominated, by, complaints, of, nazi, stormtroopers, running, amok, in, the, fall, of, 1933, a, group, of, hindenburg, s, friends, led, by, general, august, von, cramon, asked, hindenburg, to, restore, the, monarchy, hindenburg, replied, of, course, i, recognize, your, fidelity, to, our, kaiser, king, and, lord, without, reservation, but, precisely, because, i, share, this, sentiment, i, must, urgently, warn, against, the, step, you, plan, to, take, the, domestic, crisis, is, not, yet, completely, over, and, foreign, powers, will, have, a, hard, time, imagining, me, on, the, sidelines, if, it, comes, to, a, restoration, of, the, monarchy, to, say, this, is, unbelievably, painful, for, me, during, the, summer, of, 1934, hindenburg, grew, increasingly, alarmed, at, nazi, excesses, with, his, support, papen, gave, a, speech, at, the, university, of, marburg, on, 17, june, calling, for, an, end, to, state, terror, and, the, restoration, of, some, freedoms, when, propaganda, minister, joseph, goebbels, got, wind, of, it, he, not, only, canceled, a, scheduled, tape, delayed, broadcast, of, the, speech, but, ordered, the, seizure, of, newspapers, in, which, part, of, the, text, was, printed, papen, was, furious, telling, hitler, that, he, was, acting, as, a, trustee, of, hindenburg, and, that, a, junior, minister, like, goebbels, had, no, right, to, silence, him, he, resigned, and, immediately, notified, hindenburg, about, what, happened, hindenburg, was, equally, outraged, and, told, blomberg, to, give, hitler, an, ultimatum, unless, hitler, took, steps, to, end, the, growing, tension, in, germany, and, in, the, sa, hindenburg, would, sack, him, declare, martial, law, and, turn, the, government, over, to, the, army, not, long, afterward, hitler, carried, out, the, night, of, the, long, knives, in, which, the, sa, s, leaders, were, murdered, for, which, he, received, hindenburg, s, personal, thanks, in, a, telegram, a, day, later, hindenburg, learned, that, schleicher, and, his, wife, had, been, gunned, down, in, their, home, hitler, apologized, claiming, that, schleicher, had, drawn, a, pistol, during, the, nuremberg, trials, g, ring, admitted, the, telegram, was, never, seen, by, hindenburg, and, was, actually, written, by, the, nazis, hindenburg, remained, in, office, until, his, death, at, the, age, of, 86, from, lung, cancer, at, his, home, in, neudeck, east, prussia, on, 2, august, 1934, the, day, before, hitler, received, word, that, hindenburg, was, on, his, deathbed, he, then, had, the, cabinet, pass, the, law, concerning, the, head, of, state, of, the, german, reich, which, stipulated, that, upon, hindenburg, s, death, the, office, of, president, would, be, abolished, and, its, powers, merged, with, those, of, the, chancellor, under, the, title, of, f, hrer, und, reichskanzler, leader, and, chancellor, of, the, reich, two, hours, after, hindenburg, s, death, it, was, announced, that, as, a, result, of, this, law, hitler, was, now, both, germany, s, head, of, state, and, head, of, government, thereby, eliminating, the, last, remedy, by, which, he, could, be, legally, dismissed, and, cementing, his, status, as, the, absolute, dictator, of, germany, publicly, hitler, announced, that, the, presidency, was, inseparably, united, with, hindenburg, and, it, would, not, be, appropriate, for, the, title, to, ever, be, used, again, in, truth, hitler, had, known, as, early, as, april, 1934, that, hindenburg, would, likely, not, survive, the, year, he, worked, feverishly, to, get, the, armed, forces, the, only, group, in, germany, that, would, be, nearly, powerful, enough, to, remove, him, with, hindenburg, dead, to, support, his, bid, to, become, head, of, state, after, hindenburg, s, death, in, a, meeting, aboard, the, deutschland, on, 11, april, with, blomberg, army, commander, werner, von, fritsch, and, naval, commander, erich, raeder, hitler, publicly, proposed, that, he, himself, succeed, hindenburg, in, return, for, the, armed, forces, support, he, agreed, to, suppress, the, sa, and, promised, that, the, armed, forces, would, be, the, only, bearers, of, arms, in, germany, under, his, watch, raeder, agreed, right, away, but, fritsch, withheld, his, support, until, 18, may, when, the, senior, generals, unanimously, agreed, to, back, hitler, as, hindenburg, s, successor, according, to, g, nther, von, tschirschky, und, b, gendorff, an, interwar, german, diplomat, and, associate, of, hindenburg, who, later, defected, to, the, united, kingdom, president, paul, von, hindenburg, s, last, will, and, testament, had, criticised, the, nazis, and, supported, democracy, the, defector, said, that, it, had, also, argued, for, the, establishment, of, a, constitutional, monarchy, with, clear, separation, of, powers, along, with, the, abolition, of, all, forms, of, racial, and, religious, discrimination, he, alleged, that, the, document, had, been, handed, over, to, hitler, by, hindenburg, s, nazi, supporting, son, a, few, days, after, his, death, the, nazis, released, their, own, version, of, hindenburg, s, final, political, testament, which, was, complimentary, of, hitler, hitler, had, a, plebiscite, held, on, 19, august, 1934, in, which, the, german, people, were, asked, if, they, approved, of, hitler, taking, the, office, of, f, hrer, the, ja, yes, vote, amounted, to, 90, of, the, vote, this, referendum, as, well, as, all, efforts, to, make, hitler, hindenburg, s, successor, violated, the, enabling, act, although, it, gave, hitler, the, right, to, pass, laws, that, were, contrary, to, the, constitution, it, stated, that, the, president, s, powers, were, to, remain, undisturbed, which, has, long, been, interpreted, to, forbid, any, attempt, to, tamper, with, the, presidency, the, constitution, had, also, previously, been, amended, in, 1932, to, make, the, president, of, the, high, court, of, justice, not, the, chancellor, first, in, the, line, of, succession, to, the, presidency, and, even, then, only, on, an, interim, basis, until, fresh, elections, contrary, to, hindenburg, s, will, he, was, interred, with, his, wife, in, a, magnificent, ceremony, at, the, tannenberg, memorial, in, 1944, as, the, soviets, approached, generalleutnant, oskar, von, hindenburg, moved, his, parents, remains, to, western, germany, in, january, 1945, german, troops, blew, up, the, memorial, in, 1949, polish, authorities, razed, the, site, leaving, few, traces, his, remains, were, temporarily, interred, in, thuringia, along, with, the, remains, of, frederick, the, great, frederick, william, i, the,

interred, in, st, elizabeth, s, church, in, marburg, where, they, remain, to, this, day, a, plaque, on, his, grave, only, commemorates, the, victims, of, war, and, violence, without, mentioning, hindenburg, s, name, on, a, visit, to, hindenburg, s, headquarters, crown, prince, wilhelm, described, the, mood, as, family, like, he, reportedly, had, a, good, sense, of, humor, and, often, made, jokes, at, his, own, expense, he, also, had, a, prodigious, memory, for, names, and, faces, asking, colleagues, about, their, sons, in, the, army, even, recalling, their, ranks, and, units, despite, this, bonhomie, hindenburg, kept, his, own, counsel, according, to, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, hindenburg, never, said, more, than, half, of, what, he, really, thought, when, professor, hugo, vogel, commissioned, to, immortalize, the, victorious, tannenberg, commanders, in, paint, arrived, at, headquarters, most, of, his, subjects, begrudged, posing, hindenburg, visited, most, days, often, staying, for, hours, which, his, staff, attributed, to, ego, having, no, inkling, that, he, and, his, wife, collected, paintings, of, the, virgin, nor, that, he, was, an, amateur, artist, nor, that, he, liked, to, discuss, books, schiller, was, his, favorite, author, after, a, painting, was, completed, hindenburg, would, periodically, check, on, how, many, printed, reproductions, had, been, sold, vogel, was, with, him, throughout, the, war, and, did, his, last, portrait, in, 1934, protecting, his, warrior, image, hindenburg, wrote, in, his, memoir, that, the, artists, were, a, distraction, we, would, have, preferred, to, dispense, after, overseeing, germany, s, crushing, victory, at, tannenberg, paul, von, hindenburg, became, the, center, of, a, massive, personality, cult, that, persisted, throughout, his, life, henceforth, he, was, lauded, as, the, living, ideal, of, german, masculinity, and, patriotism, according, to, historian, anna, menge, the, intensity, longevity, striking, political, and, social, breadth, and, political, deployment, of, the, adulation, for, hindenburg, in, short, the, power, of, the, hindenburg, myth, from, 1914, until, 1934, and, beyond, was, a, political, phenomenon, of, the, first, order, the, hindenburg, myth, was, one, of, the, central, narratives, in, german, public, discourse, during, the, first, world, war, the, weimar, republic, and, the, early, years, of, nazi, rule, the, striking, polyvalence, of, the, narrative, it, extolled, not, only, right, wing, notions, of, authoritarian, leadership, but, also, more, bi, partisan, national, values, such, as, salvaging, something, positive, from, war, and, defeat, and, self, affirmation, in, the, face, of, crisis, meant, that, hindenburg, s, myth, could, be, deployed, by, different, groups, at, different, times, and, for, different, purposes, although, promoted, first, and, foremost, by, german, nationalists, especially, in, weimar, s, early, years, some, elements, of, the, hindenburg, myth, had, considerable, cross, party, appeal, that, his, initiation, as, a, mythical, figure, rested, on, national, defence, and, a, battle, fought, against, the, arch, enemy, of, german, social, democracy, tsarist, russia, had, endeared, him, to, many, on, the, moderate, left, from, 1914, onwards, during, world, war, i, the, most, celebrated, tribute, to, hindenburg, was, a, 12, meter, tall, wooden, likeness, erected, in, berlin, what, admirers, paid, to, drive, in, nails, ultimately, 30, tons, of, them, went, to, war, widows, smaller, versions, were, erected, throughout, germany, the, wooden, images, and, his, photographs, invariably, portray, a, resolute, indomitable, warrior, wearing, a, stern, likeness, the, famed, zeppelin, hindenburg, that, was, destroyed, by, fire, in, 1937, was, named, in, his, honor, as, was, the, hindenburgdamm, a, causeway, joining, the, island, of, sylt, to, mainland, schleswig, holstein, that, was, built, during, his, time, in, office, the, previously, upper, silesian, town, of, zabrze, german, hindenburg, o, s, was, also, renamed, after, him, in, 1915, as, well, as, the, sms, hindenburg, a, battlecruiser, commissioned, in, the, imperial, german, navy, in, 1917, and, the, last, capital, ship, to, enter, service, in, the, imperial, navy, the, hindenburg, range, in, new, guinea, which, includes, perhaps, one, of, the, world, s, largest, cliffs, the, hindenburg, wall, also, bears, his, name, historian, christopher, clark, has, criticized, hindenburg, in, his, role, as, head, of, state, for, withdrawing, his, solemn, constitutional, oaths, of, 1925, and, 1932, to, make, common, cause, with, the, sworn, enemies, of, the, republic, and, then, having, publicly, declared, that, he, would, never, consent, to, appoint,
