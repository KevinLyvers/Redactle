september, 1792, from, 1791, onwards, he, used, the, style, of, king, of, the, french, the, first, part, of, louis, xvi, s, reign, was, marked, by, attempts, to, reform, the, french, government, in, accordance, with, enlightenment, ideas, these, included, efforts, to, increase, tolerance, toward, non, catholics, as, well, as, abolish, the, death, penalty, for, deserters, the, french, nobility, reacted, to, the, proposed, reforms, with, hostility, and, successfully, opposed, their, implementation, louis, implemented, deregulation, of, the, grain, market, advocated, by, his, economic, liberal, minister, turgot, but, it, resulted, in, an, increase, in, bread, prices, in, periods, of, bad, harvests, it, led, to, food, scarcity, which, during, a, particularly, bad, harvest, in, 1775, prompted, the, masses, to, revolt, from, 1776, louis, xvi, actively, supported, the, north, american, colonists, who, were, seeking, their, independence, from, great, britain, which, was, realised, in, the, treaty, of, paris, 1783, the, ensuing, debt, and, financial, crisis, contributed, to, the, unpopularity, of, the, ancien, r, gime, this, led, to, the, convening, of, the, estates, general, of, 1789, discontent, among, the, members, of, france, s, middle, and, lower, classes, resulted, in, strengthened, opposition, to, the, french, aristocracy, and, to, the, absolute, monarchy, of, which, louis, xvi, and, his, wife, marie, antoinette, were, representatives, increasing, tensions, and, violence, were, marked, by, events, such, as, the, storming, of, the, bastille, during, which, riots, in, paris, forced, louis, to, definitively, recognize, the, legislative, authority, of, the, national, assembly, louis, s, indecisiveness, and, conservatism, led, some, elements, of, the, people, of, france, to, view, him, as, a, symbol, of, the, perceived, tyranny, of, the, ancien, r, gime, and, his, popularity, deteriorated, progressively, his, unsuccessful, flight, to, varennes, in, june, 1791, four, months, before, the, constitutional, monarchy, was, declared, seemed, to, justify, the, rumors, that, the, king, tied, his, hopes, of, political, salvation, to, the, prospects, of, foreign, intervention, his, credibility, was, deeply, undermined, and, the, abolition, of, the, monarchy, and, the, establishment, of, a, republic, became, an, ever, increasing, possibility, the, growth, of, anti, clericalism, among, revolutionaries, resulted, in, the, abolition, of, the, d, me, religious, land, tax, and, several, government, policies, aimed, at, the, dechristianization, of, france, in, a, context, of, civil, and, international, war, louis, xvi, was, suspended, and, arrested, at, the, time, of, the, insurrection, of, 10, august, 1792, one, month, later, the, monarchy, was, abolished, and, the, french, first, republic, was, proclaimed, on, 21, september, 1792, the, former, king, became, a, desacralized, french, citizen, addressed, as, citoyen, louis, capet, citizen, louis, capet, in, reference, to, his, ancestor, hugh, capet, louis, was, tried, by, the, national, convention, self, instituted, as, a, tribunal, for, the, occasion, found, guilty, of, high, treason, and, executed, by, guillotine, on, 21, january, 1793, louis, xvi, s, death, brought, an, end, to, more, than, a, thousand, years, of, continuous, french, monarchy, both, of, his, sons, died, in, childhood, before, the, bourbon, restoration, his, only, child, to, reach, adulthood, marie, th, r, se, was, given, over, to, her, austrian, relatives, in, exchange, for, french, prisoners, of, war, eventually, dying, childless, in, 1851, louis, auguste, de, france, who, was, given, the, title, duke, of, berry, at, birth, was, born, in, the, palace, of, versailles, on, 23, august, 1754, one, of, seven, children, he, was, the, second, surviving, son, of, louis, the, dauphin, of, france, and, the, grandson, of, louis, xv, and, of, his, consort, maria, leszczy, ska, his, mother, was, marie, jos, phe, of, saxony, the, daughter, of, augustus, iii, prince, elector, of, saxony, and, king, of, poland, and, archduchess, maria, josepha, of, austria, louis, auguste, was, overlooked, by, his, parents, who, favored, his, older, brother, louis, duke, of, burgundy, who, was, regarded, as, bright, and, handsome, but, died, at, the, age, of, nine, in, 1761, louis, auguste, a, strong, and, healthy, boy, but, very, shy, excelled, in, his, studies, and, had, a, strong, taste, for, latin, history, geography, and, astronomy, and, became, fluent, in, italian, and, english, his, tutors, in, mathematics, and, physics, had, high, praises, for, his, work, le, blonde, his, mathematics, instructor, wrote, that, the, prince, s, studies, were, proofs, of, intelligence, and, the, excellence, of, judgement, though, flattery, was, to, be, expected, when, addressing, a, prince, louis, auguste, s, apparent, mathematical, skills, are, corroborated, by, his, enjoyment, of, cartography, which, would, have, required, an, understanding, of, scale, and, projections, he, also, enjoyed, physical, activities, such, as, hunting, with, his, grandfather, and, rough, play, with, his, younger, brothers, louis, stanislas, count, of, provence, and, charles, philipe, count, of, artois, from, an, early, age, louis, auguste, was, encouraged, in, another, of, his, interests, locksmithing, which, was, seen, as, a, useful, pursuit, for, a, child, when, his, father, died, of, tuberculosis, on, 20, december, 1765, the, eleven, year, old, louis, auguste, became, the, new, dauphin, his, mother, never, recovered, from, the, loss, of, her, husband, and, died, on, 13, march, 1767, also, from, tuberculosis, the, strict, and, conservative, education, he, received, from, paul, fran, ois, de, quelen, de, la, vauguyon, gouverneur, des, enfants, de, france, governor, of, the, children, of, france, from, 1760, until, his, marriage, in, 1770, did, not, prepare, him, for, the, throne, that, he, was, to, inherit, in, 1774, after, the, death, of, his, grandfather, louis, xv, throughout, his, education, louis, auguste, received, a, mixture, of, studies, particular, to, religion, morality, and, humanities, his, instructors, may, have, also, had, a, good, hand, in, shaping, louis, auguste, into, the, indecisive, king, that, he, became, abb, berthier, his, instructor, taught, him, that, timidity, was, a, value, in, strong, monarchs, and, abb, soldini, his, confessor, instructed, him, not, to, let, people, read, his, mind, on, 19, april, 1770, at, the, age, of, fifteen, louis, xvi, married, the, fourteen, year, old, habsburg, archduchess, marie, antoinette, his, second, cousin, once, removed, and, the, youngest, daughter, of, francis, i, holy, roman, emperor, and, his, wife, the, empress, maria, theresa, this, marriage, was, met, with, hostility, from, the, french, public, france, s, alliance, with, its, traditional, enemy, austria, had, pulled, the, country, into, the, disastrous, seven, years, war, in, which, it, was, defeated, by, the, british, and, the, prussians, both, in, europe, and, in, north, america, by, the, time, that, louis, xvi, and, marie, antoinette, were, married, the, french, people, generally, disliked, the, austrian, alliance, and, marie, antoinette, was, seen, as, an, unwelcome, foreigner, for, the, young, couple, the, marriage, was, initially, amiable, but, distant, louis, xvi, s, shyness, and, among, other, factors, the, young, age, and, inexperience, of, the, newlyweds, who, were, near, total, strangers, to, each, other, they, had, met, only, two, days, before, their, wedding, meant, that, the, fifteen, year, old, bridegroom, failed, to, consummate, the, union, with, his, fourteen, year, old, bride, his, fear, of, being, manipulated, by, her, for, austrian, purposes, caused, him, to, behave, coldly, towards, her, in, public, correspondence, between, marie, antoinette, s, mother, and, austria, s, french, ambassador, florimond, claude, comte, de, mercy, argenteau, suggest, that, the, austrian, court, did, hope, for, the, princess, to, exert, influence, over, her, husband, letters, sent, between, the, empress, and, the, ambassador, express, a, desire, for, marie, antoinette, to, exercise, authority, in, the, french, court, and, to, encourage, louis, xvi, to, dedicate, more, attention, to, his, role, as, prince, to, their, disappointment, however, the, princess, did, not, seem, overly, interested, in, serious, affairs, over, time, the, couple, became, closer, though, while, their, marriage, was, reportedly, consummated, in, july, 1773, it, did, not, actually, happen, until, 1777, the, couple, s, failure, to, produce, any, children, for, several, years, placed, a, strain, upon, their, marriage, exacerbated, by, the, publication, of, obscene, pamphlets, libelles, mocking, their, infertility, one, such, pamphlet, questioned, can, the, king, do, it, can, t, the, king, do, it, the, reasons, for, the, couple, s, initial, failure, to, have, children, were, debated, at, that, time, and, they, have, continued, to, be, debated, since, one, suggestion, is, that, louis, auguste, suffered, from, a, physiological, dysfunction, most, often, thought, to, be, phimosis, a, suggestion, first, made, in, late, 1772, by, the, royal, doctors, historians, adhering, to, this, view, suggest, that, he, was, circumcised, a, common, treatment, for, phimosis, to, relieve, the, condition, seven, years, after, their, marriage, louis, s, doctors, were, not, in, favour, of, the, surgery, the, operation, was, delicate, and, traumatic, and, capable, of, doing, as, much, harm, as, good, to, an, adult, male, the, argument, for, phimosis, and, a, resulting, operation, is, mostly, seen, to, originate, from, stefan, zweig, s, 1932, biography, of, marie, antoinette, most, modern, historians, agree, that, louis, had, no, surgery, for, instance, as, late, as, 1777, the, prussian, envoy, baron, goltz, reported, that, the, king, of, france, had, definitely, declined, the, operation, louis, was, frequently, declared, to, be, perfectly, capable, of, sexual, intercourse, as, confirmed, by, joseph, ii, and, during, the, time, he, was, supposed, to, have, had, the, operation, he, went, out, hunting, almost, every, day, according, to, his, journal, this, would, not, have, been, possible, if, he, had, undergone, a, circumcision, at, the, very, least, he, would, have, been, unable, to, ride, to, the, hunt, for, a, few, weeks, afterwards, the, couple, s, sexual, problems, are, now, attributed, to, other, factors, antonia, fraser, s, biography, of, the, queen, discusses, joseph, ii, s, letter, on, the, matter, to, one, of, his, brothers, after, he, visited, versailles, in, 1777, in, the, letter, joseph, describes, in, astonishingly, frank, detail, louis, s, inadequate, performance, in, the, marriage, bed, and, marie, antoinette, s, lack, of, interest, in, conjugal, activity, joseph, described, the, couple, as, complete, fumblers, however, with, his, advice, louis, began, to, apply, himself, more, effectively, to, his, marital, duties, and, in, the, third, week, of, march, 1778, marie, antoinette, became, pregnant, eventually, the, royal, couple, became, the, parents, of, four, children, according, to, jeanne, louise, henriette, campan, marie, antoinette, s, lady, in, waiting, the, queen, also, suffered, two, miscarriages, the, first, one, in, 1779, a, few, months, after, the, birth, of, her, first, child, is, mentioned, in, a, letter, to, her, daughter, written, in, july, by, empress, maria, theresa, madame, campan, states, that, louis, spent, an, entire, morning, consoling, his, wife, at, her, bedside, and, swore, to, secrecy, everyone, who, knew, of, the, occurrence, marie, antoinette, suffered, a, second, miscarriage, on, the, night, of, 2, 3, november, 1783, louis, xvi, and, marie, antoinette, were, the, parents, of, four, live, born, children, in, addition, to, his, biological, children, louis, xvi, also, adopted, six, children, armand, francois, michel, gagn, c, 1771, 1792, a, poor, orphan, adopted, in, 1776, jean, amilcar, c, 1781, 1796, a, senegalese, slave, boy, given, to, the, queen, as, a, present, by, stanislas, de, boufflers, in, 1787, but, whom, she, instead, had, freed, baptized, adopted, and, placed, in, a, pension, ernestine, lambriquet, 1778, 1813, daughter, of, two, servants, at, the, palace, who, was, raised, as, the, playmate, of, his, daughter, and, whom, he, adopted, after, the, death, of, her, mother, in, 1788, and, finally, zoe, jeanne, louise, victoire, born, in, 1787, who, was, adopted, in, 1790, along, with, her, two, older, sisters, when, her, parents, an, usher, and, his, wife, in, service, of, the, king, had, died, of, these, only, armand, ernestine, and, zoe, actually, lived, with, the, royal, family, jean, amilcar, along, with, the, elder, siblings, of, zoe, and, armand, who, were, also, formally, foster, children, of, the, royal, couple, simply, lived, on, the, queen, s, expense, until, her, imprisonment, which, proved, fatal, for, at, least, amilcar, as, he, was, evicted, from, the, boarding, school, when, the, fee, was, no, longer, paid, and, reportedly, starved, to, death, on, the, street, armand, and, zoe, had, a, position, which, was, more, similar, to, that, of, ernestine, armand, lived, at, court, with, the, king, and, queen, until, he, left, them, at, the, outbreak, of, the, revolution, because, of, his, republican, sympathies, and, zoe, was, chosen, to, be, the, playmate, of, the, dauphin, just, as, ernestine, had, once, been, selected, as, the, playmate, of, marie, th, r, se, and, sent, away, to, her, sisters, in, a, convent, boarding, school, before, the, flight, to, varennes, in, 1791, when, louis, xvi, acceded, to, the, throne, in, 1774, he, was, nineteen, years, old, he, had, an, enormous, responsibility, as, the, government, was, deeply, in, debt, and, resentment, of, despotic, monarchy, was, on, the, rise, his, predecessor, his, grandfather, louis, xv, had, been, widely, hated, by, the, time, of, his, death, the, public, remembered, him, as, an, irresponsible, man, who, spent, his, time, womanizing, rather, than, administrating, furthermore, the, monarchy, had, poured, money, into, a, series, of, unsuccessful, foreign, military, campaigns, leaving, france, in, a, state, of, financial, difficulty, the, young, louis, xvi, felt, woefully, unqualified, to, resolve, the, situation, as, king, louis, xvi, focused, primarily, on, religious, freedom, and, foreign, policy, although, raised, as, the, dauphin, since, 1765, he, lacked, firmness, and, decisiveness, his, desire, to, be, loved, by, his, people, is, evident, in, the, prefaces, of, many, of, his, edicts, that, would, often, explain, the, nature, and, good, intention, of, his, actions, as, benefiting, the, people, such, as, reinstating, the, parlements, when, questioned, about, his, decision, he, said, it, may, be, considered, politically, unwise, but, it, seems, to, me, to, be, the, general, wish, and, i, want, to, be, loved, in, spite, of, his, indecisiveness, louis, xvi, was, determined, to, be, a, good, king, stating, that, he, must, always, consult, public, opinion, it, is, never, wrong, he, therefore, appointed, an, experienced, advisor, jean, fr, d, ric, ph, lypeaux, count, of, maurepas, who, until, his, death, in, 1781, would, take, charge, of, many, important, ministerial, functions, among, the, major, events, of, louis, xvi, s, reign, was, his, signing, of, the, edict, of, versailles, also, known, as, the, edict, of, tolerance, on, 7, november, 1787, which, was, registered, in, the, parlement, of, paris, on, 29, january, 1788, granting, non, roman, catholics, huguenots, and, lutherans, as, well, as, jews, civil, and, legal, status, in, france, and, the, legal, right, to, practice, their, faiths, this, edict, effectively, nullified, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, that, had, been, law, for, 102, years, the, edict, of, versailles, did, not, legally, proclaim, freedom, of, religion, in, france, this, took, two, more, years, with, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, of, 1789, however, it, was, an, important, step, in, eliminating, religious, tensions, and, it, officially, ended, religious, persecution, within, his, realm, radical, financial, reforms, by, anne, robert, jacques, turgot, and, guillaume, chr, tien, de, lamoignon, de, malesherbes, angered, the, nobles, and, were, blocked, by, the, parlements, who, insisted, that, the, king, did, not, have, the, legal, right, to, levy, new, taxes, so, in, 1776, turgot, was, dismissed, and, malesherbes, resigned, to, be, replaced, by, jacques, necker, necker, supported, the, american, revolution, and, he, carried, out, a, policy, of, taking, out, large, international, loans, instead, of, raising, taxes, he, attempted, to, gain, public, favor, in, 1781, by, publishing, the, first, ever, accounting, of, the, french, crown, s, expenses, and, accounts, the, compte, rendu, au, roi, this, misleading, publication, led, the, people, of, france, to, believe, the, kingdom, ran, a, modest, surplus, when, this, policy, of, hiding, and, ignoring, the, kingdom, s, financial, woes, failed, miserably, louis, dismissed, and, replaced, him, in, 1783, with, charles, alexandre, de, calonne, who, increased, public, spending, to, buy, the, country, s, way, out, of, debt, again, this, failed, so, louis, convoked, the, assembly, of, notables, in, 1787, to, discuss, a, revolutionary, new, fiscal, reform, proposed, by, calonne, when, the, nobles, were, informed, of, the, true, extent, of, the, debt, they, were, shocked, and, rejected, the, plan, after, this, louis, xvi, and, his, new, controller, general, of, finances, tienne, charles, de, lom, nie, de, brienne, tried, to, simply, force, the, parlement, of, paris, to, register, the, new, laws, and, fiscal, reforms, upon, the, refusal, of, the, members, of, the, parlement, louis, xvi, tried, to, use, his, absolute, power, to, subjugate, them, by, every, means, enforcing, in, many, occasions, the, registration, of, his, reforms, via, lit, de, justice, 6, august, 1787, 19, november, 1787, and, 8, may, 1788, exiling, all, parlement, magistrates, to, troyes, as, a, punishment, on, 15, august, 1787, prohibiting, six, members, from, attending, parliamentary, sessions, on, 19, november, arresting, two, very, important, members, of, the, parlement, who, opposed, his, reforms, on, 6, may, 1788, and, even, dissolving, and, depriving, of, all, power, the, parlement, replacing, it, with, a, plenary, court, on, 8, may, 1788, the, failure, of, these, measures, and, displays, of, royal, power, is, attributable, to, three, decisive, factors, first, the, majority, of, the, population, stood, in, favor, of, the, parlement, against, the, king, and, thus, continuously, rebelled, against, him, second, the, royal, treasury, was, financially, destitute, to, a, crippling, degree, leaving, it, incapable, of, sustaining, its, own, imposed, reforms, third, although, the, king, enjoyed, as, much, absolute, power, as, his, predecessors, he, lacked, the, personal, authority, crucial, for, absolutism, to, function, properly, now, unpopular, with, both, the, commoners, and, the, aristocracy, louis, xvi, was, therefore, only, very, briefly, able, to, impose, his, decisions, and, reforms, for, periods, ranging, from, 2, to, 4, months, before, having, to, revoke, them, as, authority, dissipated, from, him, and, reforms, were, clearly, becoming, unavoidable, there, were, increasingly, loud, calls, for, him, to, convoke, the, estates, general, which, had, not, met, since, 1614, at, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, louis, xiii, as, a, last, ditch, attempt, to, get, new, monetary, reforms, approved, louis, xvi, convoked, the, estates, general, on, 8, august, 1788, setting, the, date, of, their, opening, on, 1, may, 1789, with, the, convocation, of, the, estates, general, as, in, many, other, instances, during, his, reign, louis, xvi, placed, his, reputation, and, public, image, in, the, hands, of, those, who, were, perhaps, not, as, sensitive, to, the, desires, of, the, french, population, as, he, was, because, it, had, been, so, long, since, the, estates, general, had, been, convened, there, was, some, debate, as, to, which, procedures, should, be, followed, ultimately, the, parlement, of, paris, agreed, that, all, traditional, observances, should, be, carefully, maintained, to, avoid, the, impression, that, the, estates, general, could, make, things, up, as, it, went, along, under, this, decision, the, king, agreed, to, retain, many, of, the, traditions, which, had, been, the, norm, in, 1614, and, prior, convocations, of, the, estates, general, but, which, were, intolerable, to, a, third, estate, the, bourgeoisie, buoyed, by, recent, proclamations, of, equality, for, example, the, first, and, second, estates, the, clergy, and, nobility, respectively, proceeded, into, the, assembly, wearing, their, finest, garments, while, the, third, estate, was, required, to, wear, plain, oppressively, somber, black, an, act, of, alienation, that, louis, xvi, would, likely, have, not, condoned, he, seemed, to, regard, the, deputies, of, the, estates, general, with, respect, in, a, wave, of, self, important, patriotism, members, of, the, estates, refused, to, remove, their, hats, in, the, king, s, presence, so, louis, removed, his, to, them, this, convocation, was, one, of, the, events, that, transformed, the, general, economic, and, political, malaise, of, the, country, into, the, french, revolution, in, june, 1789, the, third, estate, unilaterally, declared, itself, the, national, assembly, louis, xvi, s, attempts, to, control, it, resulted, in, the, tennis, court, oath, serment, du, jeu, de, paume, on, 20, june, the, declaration, of, the, national, constituent, assembly, on, 9, july, and, eventually, to, the, storming, of, the, bastille, on, 14, july, which, started, the, french, revolution, within, three, short, months, the, majority, of, the, king, s, executive, authority, had, been, transferred, to, the, elected, representatives, of, the, nation, the, menus, plaisirs, du, roi, was, under, the, direction, of, papillon, de, la, fert, and, he, gave, details, in, his, journal, about, the, costs, of, the, performances, over, the, years, 1756, 1780, in, three, different, palaces, the, wedding, in, 1771, was, especially, costly, the, performance, of, castor, et, pollux, in, 1779, when, he, was, visited, by, his, brother, in, law, joseph, ii, involved, more, than, 500, people, royal, household, spending, in, 1788, was, 13, of, total, state, expenses, excluding, interest, on, debts, french, involvement, in, the, seven, years, war, had, left, louis, xvi, a, disastrous, inheritance, britain, s, victories, had, seen, them, capture, most, of, france, s, colonial, territories, while, some, were, returned, to, france, at, the, treaty, of, paris, 1763, almost, all, of, new, france, was, ceded, to, the, british, or, to, france, s, spanish, allies, to, compensate, them, for, losses, to, the, british, this, had, led, to, a, strategy, amongst, the, french, leadership, of, seeking, to, rebuild, the, french, military, in, order, to, fight, a, war, of, revenge, against, britain, in, which, it, was, hoped, the, lost, colonies, could, be, recovered, france, still, maintained, a, strong, influence, in, the, west, indies, and, in, india, maintained, five, trading, posts, leaving, opportunities, for, disputes, and, power, play, with, great, britain, in, the, spring, of, 1776, charles, gravier, comte, de, vergennes, the, minister, for, foreign, affairs, saw, an, opportunity, to, humiliate, france, s, long, standing, enemy, great, britain, and, to, recover, territory, lost, during, the, seven, years, war, by, supporting, the, american, revolution, in, the, same, year, louis, was, persuaded, by, pierre, beaumarchais, to, send, supplies, ammunition, and, guns, to, the, rebels, secretly, early, in, 1778, he, signed, a, formal, treaty, of, alliance, and, later, that, year, france, went, to, war, with, britain, in, deciding, in, favor, of, war, despite, france, s, large, financial, problems, the, king, was, materially, influenced, by, alarmist, reports, after, the, battle, of, saratoga, which, suggested, that, britain, was, preparing, to, make, huge, concessions, to, the, thirteen, colonies, and, then, allied, with, them, to, strike, at, french, and, spanish, possessions, in, the, west, indies, spain, and, the, netherlands, soon, joined, the, french, in, an, anti, british, coalition, after, 1778, great, britain, switched, its, focus, to, the, west, indies, as, defending, the, sugar, islands, was, considered, more, important, than, trying, to, recover, the, thirteen, colonies, france, and, spain, planned, to, invade, the, british, isles, themselves, with, the, armada, of, 1779, but, the, operation, never, went, ahead, france, s, initial, military, assistance, to, the, american, rebels, was, a, disappointment, with, defeats, at, rhode, island, and, savannah, in, 1780, france, sent, jean, baptiste, donatien, de, vimeur, comte, de, rochambeau, and, fran, ois, joseph, paul, de, grasse, to, help, the, americans, along, with, large, land, and, naval, forces, the, french, expeditionary, force, arrived, in, north, america, in, july, 1780, the, appearance, of, french, fleets, in, the, caribbean, was, followed, by, the, capture, of, a, number, of, the, sugar, islands, including, tobago, and, grenada, in, october, 1781, the, french, naval, blockade, was, instrumental, in, forcing, a, british, army, under, cornwallis, to, surrender, at, the, siege, of, yorktown, when, news, of, this, reached, london, in, march, 1782, the, north, ministry, fell, and, great, britain, immediately, sued, for, peace, terms, however, france, delayed, the, end, of, the, war, until, september, 1783, in, the, hope, of, overrunning, more, british, colonies, in, india, and, the, west, indies, great, britain, recognized, the, independence, of, the, thirteen, colonies, as, the, united, states, of, america, and, the, french, war, ministry, rebuilt, its, army, however, the, british, defeated, the, main, french, fleet, in, 1782, at, the, battle, of, the, saintes, and, successfully, defended, jamaica, and, gibraltar, france, gained, little, from, the, treaty, of, paris, 1783, that, ended, the, war, except, the, colonies, of, tobago, and, senegal, louis, xvi, was, wholly, disappointed, in, his, aims, of, recovering, canada, india, and, other, islands, in, the, west, indies, from, britain, as, they, were, too, well, defended, and, the, royal, navy, made, any, attempted, invasion, of, mainland, britain, impossible, the, war, cost, 1, 066, million, livres, financed, by, new, loans, at, high, interest, with, no, new, taxes, necker, concealed, the, crisis, from, the, public, by, explaining, only, that, ordinary, revenues, exceeded, ordinary, expenses, and, not, mentioning, the, loans, after, he, was, forced, from, office, in, 1781, new, taxes, were, levied, this, intervention, in, america, was, not, possible, without, france, adopting, a, neutral, position, in, european, affairs, to, avoid, being, drawn, into, a, continental, war, which, would, be, simply, a, repetition, of, the, french, policy, mistakes, in, the, seven, years, war, vergennes, supported, by, king, louis, refused, to, go, to, war, to, support, austria, in, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, in, 1778, when, the, queen, s, brother, joseph, ii, holy, roman, emperor, tried, to, partition, bavaria, over, a, disputed, inheritance, vergennes, and, maurepas, refused, to, support, the, austrian, position, but, the, intervention, of, marie, antoinette, in, favor, of, austria, obliged, france, to, adopt, a, position, more, favorable, to, austria, which, in, the, treaty, of, teschen, was, able, to, get, in, compensation, the, innviertel, a, territory, whose, population, numbered, around, 100, 000, persons, however, this, intervention, was, a, disaster, for, the, image, of, the, queen, who, was, named, l, autrichienne, a, pun, in, french, meaning, austrian, but, the, chienne, suffix, can, mean, bitch, on, account, of, it, louis, xvi, hoped, to, use, the, american, revolutionary, war, as, an, opportunity, to, expel, the, british, from, india, in, 1782, he, sealed, an, alliance, with, the, peshwa, madhavrao, ii, as, a, consequence, the, marquis, de, bussy, castelnau, moved, his, troops, to, the, isle, de, france, now, mauritius, and, later, contributed, to, the, french, effort, in, india, in, 1783, pierre, andr, de, suffren, became, the, ally, of, hyder, ali, in, the, second, anglo, mysore, war, against, the, british, east, india, company, from, 1782, to, 1783, engaging, the, royal, navy, along, the, coasts, of, india, and, ceylon, france, also, intervened, in, cochinchina, following, pierre, pigneau, de, behaine, s, intervention, to, obtain, military, aid, a, france, cochinchina, alliance, was, signed, through, the, treaty, of, versailles, of, 1787, between, louis, xvi, and, prince, nguy, n, nh, louis, xvi, also, encouraged, major, voyages, of, exploration, in, 1785, he, appointed, jean, fran, ois, de, galaup, comte, de, lap, rouse, to, lead, a, sailing, expedition, around, the, world, la, p, rouse, and, his, fleet, disappeared, after, leaving, botany, bay, in, march, 1788, louis, is, recorded, as, having, asked, on, the, morning, of, his, execution, any, news, of, la, p, rouse, there, is, a, lack, of, scholarship, on, the, subject, of, louis, xvi, s, time, as, a, constitutional, monarch, though, it, was, a, significant, length, of, time, the, reason, as, to, why, many, biographers, have, not, elaborated, extensively, on, this, time, in, the, king, s, life, is, due, to, the, uncertainty, surrounding, his, actions, during, this, period, as, louis, xvi, s, declaration, that, was, left, behind, in, the, tuileries, stated, that, he, regarded, his, actions, during, his, constitutional, reign, as, provisional, he, reflected, that, his, palace, was, a, prison, this, time, period, was, exemplary, in, its, demonstration, of, an, institution, s, deliberation, while, in, their, last, standing, moments, louis, xvi, s, time, in, his, previous, palace, came, to, an, end, on, 5, october, 1789, when, an, angry, mob, of, parisian, working, men, and, women, was, incited, by, revolutionaries, and, marched, on, the, palace, of, versailles, where, the, royal, family, lived, at, dawn, they, infiltrated, the, palace, and, attempted, to, kill, the, queen, who, was, associated, with, a, frivolous, lifestyle, that, symbolized, much, that, was, despised, about, the, ancien, r, gime, after, the, situation, had, been, defused, by, lafayette, head, of, the, national, guard, the, king, and, his, family, were, brought, by, the, crowd, to, the, tuileries, palace, in, paris, the, reasoning, being, that, the, king, would, be, more, accountable, to, the, people, if, he, lived, among, them, in, paris, the, revolution, s, principles, of, popular, sovereignty, though, central, to, democratic, principles, of, later, eras, marked, a, decisive, break, from, the, centuries, old, principle, of, divine, right, that, was, at, the, heart, of, the, french, monarchy, as, a, result, the, revolution, was, opposed, by, many, of, the, rural, people, of, france, and, by, all, the, governments, of, france, s, neighbors, still, within, the, city, of, paris, and, amongst, the, philosophers, of, the, time, many, of, which, were, members, of, the, national, assembly, the, monarchy, had, next, to, no, support, as, the, revolution, became, more, radical, and, the, masses, more, uncontrollable, several, of, the, revolution, s, leading, figures, began, to, doubt, its, benefits, some, like, honor, mirabeau, secretly, plotted, with, the, crown, to, restore, its, power, in, a, new, constitutional, form, beginning, in, 1791, armand, marc, comte, de, montmorin, minister, of, foreign, affairs, started, to, organize, covert, resistance, to, the, revolutionary, forces, thus, the, funds, of, the, liste, civile, voted, annually, by, the, national, assembly, were, partially, assigned, to, secret, expenses, in, order, to, preserve, the, monarchy, arnault, laporte, who, was, in, charge, of, the, civil, list, collaborated, with, both, montmorin, and, mirabeau, after, the, sudden, death, of, mirabeau, maximilien, radix, de, sainte, foix, a, noted, financier, took, his, place, in, effect, he, headed, a, secret, council, of, advisers, to, louis, xvi, which, tried, to, preserve, the, monarchy, these, schemes, proved, unsuccessful, and, were, exposed, later, when, the, armoire, de, fer, was, discovered, regarding, the, financial, difficulties, facing, france, the, assembly, created, the, comit, des, finances, and, while, louis, xvi, attempted, to, declare, his, concern, and, interest, in, remedying, the, economic, situations, inclusively, offering, to, melt, crown, silver, as, a, dramatic, measure, it, appeared, to, the, public, that, the, king, did, not, understand, that, such, statements, no, longer, held, the, same, meaning, as, they, did, before, and, that, doing, such, a, thing, could, not, restore, the, economy, of, a, country, mirabeau, s, death, on, 7, april, and, louis, xvi, s, indecision, fatally, weakened, negotiations, between, the, crown, and, moderate, politicians, the, third, estate, leaders, also, had, no, desire, in, turning, back, or, remaining, moderate, after, their, hard, efforts, to, change, the, politics, of, the, time, and, so, the, plans, for, a, constitutional, monarchy, did, not, last, long, on, one, hand, louis, was, nowhere, near, as, reactionary, as, his, brothers, the, count, of, provence, and, the, count, of, artois, and, he, repeatedly, sent, messages, to, them, requesting, a, halt, to, their, attempts, to, launch, counter, coups, this, was, often, done, through, his, secretly, nominated, regent, cardinal, tienne, charles, de, lom, nie, de, brienne, on, the, other, hand, louis, was, alienated, from, the, new, democratic, government, both, by, its, negative, reaction, to, the, traditional, role, of, the, monarch, and, in, its, treatment, of, him, and, his, family, he, was, particularly, irked, by, being, kept, essentially, as, a, prisoner, in, the, tuileries, and, by, the, refusal, of, the, new, regime, to, allow, him, to, have, confessors, and, priests, of, his, choice, rather, than, constitutional, priests, pledged, to, the, state, and, not, the, roman, catholic, church, on, 21, june, 1791, louis, xvi, attempted, to, flee, secretly, with, his, family, from, paris, to, the, royalist, fortress, town, of, montm, dy, on, the, northeastern, border, of, france, where, he, would, join, the, migr, s, and, be, protected, by, austria, the, voyage, was, planned, by, the, swedish, nobleman, and, often, assumed, secret, lover, of, queen, marie, antoinette, axel, von, fersen, while, the, national, assembly, worked, painstakingly, towards, a, constitution, louis, and, marie, antoinette, were, involved, in, plans, of, their, own, louis, had, appointed, louis, auguste, le, tonnelier, de, breteuil, to, act, as, plenipotentiary, dealing, with, other, foreign, heads, of, state, in, an, attempt, to, bring, about, a, counter, revolution, louis, himself, held, reservations, against, depending, on, foreign, assistance, like, his, mother, and, father, he, thought, that, the, austrians, were, treacherous, and, the, prussians, were, overly, ambitious, as, tensions, in, paris, rose, and, he, was, pressured, to, accept, measures, from, the, assembly, against, his, will, louis, xvi, and, the, queen, plotted, to, secretly, escape, from, france, beyond, escape, they, hoped, to, raise, an, armed, congress, with, the, help, of, the, migr, s, as, well, as, assistance, from, other, nations, with, which, they, could, return, and, in, essence, recapture, france, this, degree, of, planning, reveals, louis, s, political, determination, but, it, was, for, this, determined, plot, that, he, was, eventually, convicted, of, high, treason, he, left, behind, on, his, bed, a, 16, page, written, manifesto, d, claration, du, roi, adress, e, tous, les, fran, ois, sa, sortie, de, paris, traditionally, known, as, the, testament, politique, de, louis, xvi, political, testament, of, louis, xvi, explaining, his, rejection, of, the, constitutional, system, as, illegitimate, the, national, assembly, was, quick, to, decide, to, publish, the, theory, that, the, king, had, been, kidnapped, thus, avoiding, any, challenge, to, the, constitution, which, was, then, nearing, completion, while, at, the, same, time, ordering, that, the, carriage, be, placed, under, arrest, it, was, a, deliberately, deceptive, choice, since, louis, xvi, had, left, a, manifesto, in, plain, view, assuming, and, justifying, the, escape, la, fayette, decided, to, censor, the, text, letters, were, sent, throughout, the, country, to, stop, the, royal, carriage, louis, s, indecision, many, delays, and, misunderstanding, of, france, were, responsible, for, the, failure, of, the, escape, within, 24, hours, the, royal, family, was, arrested, at, varennes, en, argonne, shortly, after, jean, baptiste, drouet, who, recognised, the, king, from, his, profile, on, a, 50, livres, assignat, paper, money, had, given, the, alert, louis, xvi, and, his, family, were, taken, back, to, paris, where, they, arrived, on, 25, june, viewed, suspiciously, as, traitors, they, were, placed, under, tight, house, arrest, upon, their, return, to, the, tuileries, at, the, individual, level, the, failure, of, the, escape, plans, was, due, to, a, series, of, misadventures, delays, misinterpretations, and, poor, judgments, in, a, wider, perspective, the, failure, was, attributable, to, the, king, s, indecision, he, repeatedly, postponed, the, schedule, allowing, for, smaller, problems, to, become, severe, furthermore, he, totally, misunderstood, the, political, situation, he, thought, only, a, small, number, of, radicals, in, paris, were, promoting, a, revolution, that, the, people, as, a, whole, rejected, he, thought, mistakenly, that, he, was, beloved, by, his, subjects, the, king, s, flight, in, the, short, term, was, traumatic, for, france, inciting, a, wave, of, emotions, that, ranged, from, anxiety, to, violence, to, panic, the, realization, that, the, king, had, repudiated, the, revolution, was, a, shock, for, people, who, until, then, had, seen, him, as, a, good, king, who, governed, as, a, manifestation, of, god, s, will, many, suspected, the, king, of, collaborating, with, the, austrians, due, to, marie, antoinette, s, family, ties, and, the, fact, that, the, monarchs, had, clearly, been, heading, for, the, austrian, border, war, now, seemed, imminent, and, the, king, seemed, to, have, been, politically, involved, with, france, s, traditional, enemies, who, were, still, widely, hated, despite, recent, cooperation, many, citizens, felt, betrayed, and, as, a, result, republicanism, now, burst, out, of, the, coffee, houses, and, became, a, dominating, philosophy, of, the, rapidly, radicalized, french, revolution, the, other, monarchies, of, europe, looked, with, concern, upon, the, developments, in, france, and, considered, whether, they, should, intervene, either, in, support, of, louis, or, to, take, advantage, of, the, chaos, in, france, the, key, figure, was, marie, antoinette, s, brother, leopold, ii, holy, roman, emperor, initially, he, had, looked, on, the, revolution, with, equanimity, however, he, became, more, and, more, disturbed, as, it, became, more, and, more, radical, despite, this, he, still, hoped, to, avoid, war, on, 27, august, leopold, and, frederick, william, ii, of, prussia, in, consultation, with, migr, s, french, nobles, issued, the, declaration, of, pillnitz, which, declared, the, interest, of, the, monarchs, of, europe, in, the, well, being, of, louis, and, his, family, and, threatened, vague, but, severe, consequences, if, anything, should, befall, them, although, leopold, saw, the, pillnitz, declaration, as, an, easy, way, to, appear, concerned, about, the, developments, in, france, without, committing, any, soldiers, or, finances, to, change, them, the, revolutionary, leaders, in, paris, viewed, it, fearfully, as, a, dangerous, foreign, attempt, to, undermine, france, s, sovereignty, in, addition, to, the, ideological, differences, between, france, and, the, monarchical, powers, of, europe, there, were, continuing, disputes, over, the, status, of, austrian, estates, in, alsace, and, the, concern, of, members, of, the, national, constituent, assembly, about, the, agitation, of, migr, s, nobles, abroad, especially, in, the, austrian, netherlands, and, the, minor, states, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, the, end, the, legislative, assembly, supported, by, louis, xvi, declared, war, on, austria, the, king, of, bohemia, and, hungary, first, voting, for, war, on, 20, april, 1792, after, a, long, list, of, grievances, was, presented, to, it, by, the, foreign, minister, charles, fran, ois, dumouriez, dumouriez, prepared, an, immediate, invasion, of, the, austrian, netherlands, where, he, expected, the, local, population, to, rise, against, austrian, rule, however, the, revolution, had, thoroughly, disorganised, the, army, and, the, forces, raised, were, insufficient, for, the, invasion, the, soldiers, fled, at, the, first, sign, of, battle, and, in, one, case, on, 28, april, 1792, murdered, their, general, irish, born, th, obald, dillon, whom, they, accused, of, treason, while, the, revolutionary, government, frantically, raised, fresh, troops, and, reorganised, its, armies, a, prussian, austrian, army, under, charles, william, ferdinand, duke, of, brunswick, assembled, at, koblenz, on, the, rhine, in, july, the, invasion, began, with, brunswick, s, army, easily, taking, the, fortresses, of, longwy, and, verdun, the, duke, then, issued, on, 25, july, a, proclamation, called, the, brunswick, manifesto, written, by, louis, s, migr, cousin, louis, joseph, prince, of, cond, declaring, the, intent, of, the, austrians, and, prussians, to, restore, the, king, to, his, full, powers, and, to, treat, any, person, or, town, who, opposed, them, as, rebels, to, be, condemned, to, death, by, martial, law, contrary, to, its, intended, purpose, of, strengthening, louis, xvi, s, position, against, the, revolutionaries, the, brunswick, manifesto, had, the, opposite, effect, of, greatly, undermining, his, already, highly, tenuous, position, it, was, taken, by, many, to, be, the, final, proof, of, collusion, between, the, king, and, foreign, powers, in, a, conspiracy, against, his, own, country, the, anger, of, the, populace, boiled, over, on, 10, august, when, an, armed, mob, with, the, backing, of, a, new, municipal, government, of, paris, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, insurrectional, paris, commune, marched, upon, and, invaded, the, tuileries, palace, the, royal, family, took, shelter, with, the, legislative, assembly, louis, was, officially, arrested, on, 13, august, 1792, and, sent, to, the, temple, an, ancient, fortress, in, paris, that, was, used, as, a, prison, on, 21, september, the, national, assembly, declared, france, to, be, a, republic, and, abolished, the, monarchy, louis, was, stripped, of, all, of, his, titles, and, honors, and, from, this, date, was, known, as, citoyen, louis, capet, the, girondins, were, partial, to, keeping, the, deposed, king, under, arrest, both, as, a, hostage, and, a, guarantee, for, the, future, members, of, the, commune, and, the, most, radical, deputies, who, would, soon, form, the, group, known, as, the, mountain, argued, for, louis, s, immediate, execution, the, legal, background, of, many, of, the, deputies, made, it, difficult, for, a, great, number, of, them, to, accept, an, execution, without, the, due, process, of, law, and, it, was, voted, that, the, deposed, monarch, be, tried, before, the, national, convention, the, organ, that, housed, the, representatives, of, the, sovereign, people, in, many, ways, the, former, king, s, trial, represented, the, trial, of, the, monarchy, by, the, revolution, it, was, seen, as, if, with, the, death, of, one, came, the, life, of, the, other, the, historian, jules, michelet, later, argued, that, the, death, of, the, former, king, led, to, the, acceptance, of, violence, as, a, tool, for, happiness, he, said, if, we, accept, the, proposition, that, one, person, can, be, sacrificed, for, the, happiness, of, the, many, it, will, soon, be, demonstrated, that, two, or, three, or, more, could, also, be, sacrificed, for, the, happiness, of, the, many, little, by, little, we, will, find, reasons, for, sacrificing, the, many, for, the, happiness, of, the, many, and, we, will, think, it, was, a, bargain, two, events, led, up, to, the, trial, for, louis, xvi, first, after, the, battle, of, valmy, on, 22, september, 1792, general, dumouriez, negotiated, with, the, prussians, who, evacuated, france, louis, could, no, longer, be, considered, a, hostage, or, as, leverage, in, negotiations, with, the, invading, forces, second, in, november, 1792, the, armoire, de, fer, iron, chest, incident, took, place, at, the, tuileries, palace, when, the, existence, of, the, hidden, safe, in, the, king, s, bedroom, containing, compromising, documents, and, correspondence, was, revealed, by, fran, ois, gamain, the, versailles, locksmith, who, had, installed, it, gamain, went, to, paris, on, 20, november, and, told, jean, marie, roland, girondin, minister, of, the, interior, who, ordered, it, opened, the, resulting, scandal, served, to, discredit, the, king, following, these, two, events, the, girondins, could, no, longer, keep, the, king, from, trial, on, 11, december, among, crowded, and, silent, streets, the, deposed, king, was, brought, from, the, temple, to, stand, before, the, national, convention, and, hear, his, indictment, an, accusation, of, high, treason, and, crimes, against, the, state, on, 26, december, his, counsel, raymond, des, ze, delivered, louis, s, response, to, the, charges, with, the, assistance, of, fran, ois, tronchet, and, guillaume, chr, tien, de, lamoignon, de, malesherbes, before, the, trial, started, and, louis, mounted, his, defense, to, the, convention, he, told, his, lawyers, that, he, knew, he, would, be, found, guilty, and, be, killed, but, to, prepare, and, act, as, though, they, could, win, he, was, resigned, to, and, accepted, his, fate, before, the, verdict, was, determined, but, he, was, willing, to, fight, to, be, remembered, as, a, good, king, for, his, people, the, convention, would, be, voting, on, three, questions, first, is, louis, guilty, second, whatever, the, decision, should, there, be, an, appeal, to, the, people, and, third, if, found, guilty, what, punishment, should, louis, suffer, the, order, of, the, voting, on, each, question, was, a, compromise, within, the, jacobin, movement, between, the, girondins, and, the, mountain, neither, were, satisfied, but, both, accepted, on, 15, january, 1793, the, convention, composed, of, 721, deputies, voted, on, the, verdict, given, the, overwhelming, evidence, of, louis, s, collusion, with, the, invaders, the, verdict, was, a, foregone, conclusion, with, 693, deputies, voting, guilty, none, for, acquittal, with, 23, abstaining, the, next, day, a, roll, call, vote, was, carried, out, to, decide, upon, the, fate, of, the, former, king, and, the, result, was, uncomfortably, close, for, such, a, dramatic, decision, 288, of, the, deputies, voted, against, death, and, for, some, other, alternative, mainly, some, means, of, imprisonment, or, exile, 72, of, the, deputies, voted, for, the, death, penalty, but, subject, to, several, delaying, conditions, and, reservations, the, voting, took, a, total, of, 36, hours, 361, of, the, deputies, voted, for, louis, s, immediate, execution, louis, was, condemned, to, death, by, a, majority, of, one, vote, philippe, galit, formerly, the, duke, of, orl, ans, and, louis, cousin, voted, for, louis, s, execution, a, cause, of, much, future, bitterness, among, french, monarchists, he, would, himself, be, guillotined, on, the, same, scaffold, place, de, la, r, volution, before, the, end, of, the, same, year, on, 6, november, 1793, the, next, day, a, motion, to, grant, louis, xvi, reprieve, from, the, death, sentence, was, voted, down, 310, of, the, deputies, requested, mercy, but, 380, voted, for, the, immediate, execution, of, the, death, penalty, this, decision, would, be, final, malesherbes, wanted, to, break, the, news, to, louis, and, bitterly, lamented, the, verdict, but, louis, told, him, he, would, see, him, again, in, a, happier, life, and, he, would, regret, leaving, a, friend, like, malesherbes, behind, the, last, thing, louis, said, to, him, was, that, he, needed, to, control, his, tears, because, all, eyes, would, be, upon, him, on, 21, january, 1793, louis, xvi, at, age, 38, was, beheaded, by, guillotine, on, the, place, de, la, r, volution, as, louis, xvi, mounted, the, scaffold, he, appeared, dignified, and, resigned, he, delivered, a, short,
