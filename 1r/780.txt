sir, karl, raimund, popper, ch, frs, fba, 28, july, 1902, 17, september, 1994, was, an, austrian, british, philosopher, academic, and, social, commentator, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, most, influential, philosophers, of, science, popper, is, known, for, his, rejection, of, the, classical, inductivist, views, on, the, scientific, method, in, favour, of, empirical, falsification, according, to, popper, a, theory, in, the, empirical, sciences, can, never, be, proven, but, it, can, be, falsified, meaning, that, it, can, and, should, be, scrutinised, with, decisive, experiments, popper, was, opposed, to, the, classical, justificationist, account, of, knowledge, which, he, replaced, with, critical, rationalism, namely, the, first, non, justificational, philosophy, of, criticism, in, the, history, of, philosophy, in, political, discourse, he, is, known, for, his, vigorous, defence, of, liberal, democracy, and, the, principles, of, social, criticism, that, he, believed, made, a, flourishing, open, society, possible, popper, s, political, thought, would, seem, to, fit, most, comfortably, within, the, liberal, camp, broadly, understood, reason, toleration, nonviolence, and, individual, freedom, formed, the, core, of, his, political, values, and, he, identified, modern, liberal, democracies, as, the, best, to, date, embodiment, of, an, open, society, popper, himself, acknowledged, that, his, primary, interest, was, nature, and, not, politics, karl, popper, was, born, in, vienna, then, in, austria, hungary, in, 1902, to, upper, middle, class, parents, all, of, popper, s, grandparents, were, assimilated, jews, the, popper, family, converted, to, lutheranism, before, he, was, born, and, so, he, received, a, lutheran, baptism, his, father, simon, siegmund, carl, popper, 1856, 1932, was, a, lawyer, from, bohemia, and, a, doctor, of, law, at, the, vienna, university, his, mother, jenny, schiff, 1864, 1938, was, an, accomplished, pianist, of, silesian, and, hungarian, descent, popper, s, uncle, was, the, austrian, philosopher, josef, popper, lynkeus, after, establishing, themselves, in, vienna, the, poppers, made, a, rapid, social, climb, in, viennese, society, as, popper, s, father, became, a, partner, in, the, law, firm, of, vienna, s, liberal, mayor, raimund, gr, bl, and, after, gr, bl, s, death, in, 1898, took, over, the, business, popper, received, his, middle, name, after, raimund, gr, bl, in, his, autobiography, popper, erroneously, recalls, that, gr, bl, s, first, name, was, carl, his, parents, were, close, friends, of, sigmund, freud, s, sister, rosa, graf, his, father, was, a, bibliophile, who, had, 12, 000, 14, 000, volumes, in, his, personal, library, and, took, an, interest, in, philosophy, the, classics, and, social, and, political, issues, popper, inherited, both, the, library, and, the, disposition, from, him, later, he, would, describe, the, atmosphere, of, his, upbringing, as, having, been, decidedly, bookish, popper, left, school, at, the, age, of, 16, and, attended, lectures, in, mathematics, physics, philosophy, psychology, and, the, history, of, music, as, a, guest, student, at, the, university, of, vienna, in, 1919, popper, became, attracted, by, marxism, and, subsequently, joined, the, association, of, socialist, school, students, he, also, became, a, member, of, the, social, democratic, workers, party, of, austria, which, was, at, that, time, a, party, that, fully, adopted, the, marxism, after, the, street, battle, in, the, h, rlgasse, on, 15, june, 1919, when, police, shot, eight, of, his, unarmed, party, comrades, he, turned, away, from, what, he, saw, as, the, philosopher, karl, marx, s, historical, materialism, abandoned, the, ideology, and, remained, a, supporter, of, social, liberalism, throughout, his, life, popper, worked, in, street, construction, for, a, short, time, but, was, unable, to, cope, with, the, heavy, labour, continuing, to, attend, university, as, a, guest, student, he, started, an, apprenticeship, as, a, cabinetmaker, which, he, completed, as, a, journeyman, he, was, dreaming, at, that, time, of, starting, a, daycare, facility, for, children, for, which, he, assumed, the, ability, to, make, furniture, might, be, useful, after, that, he, did, voluntary, service, in, one, of, psychoanalyst, alfred, adler, s, clinics, for, children, in, 1922, he, did, his, matura, by, way, of, a, second, chance, education, and, finally, joined, the, university, as, an, ordinary, student, he, completed, his, examination, as, an, elementary, teacher, in, 1924, and, started, working, at, an, after, school, care, club, for, socially, endangered, children, in, 1925, he, went, to, the, newly, founded, p, dagogisches, institut, and, continued, studying, philosophy, and, psychology, around, that, time, he, started, courting, josefine, anna, henninger, who, later, became, his, wife, popper, and, his, wife, had, chosen, not, to, have, children, because, of, the, circumstances, of, war, in, the, early, years, of, their, marriage, popper, commented, that, this, was, perhaps, a, cowardly, but, in, a, way, a, right, decision, in, 1928, popper, earned, a, doctorate, in, psychology, under, the, supervision, of, karl, b, hler, with, moritz, schlick, being, the, second, chair, of, the, thesis, committee, his, dissertation, was, titled, zur, methodenfrage, der, denkpsychologie, on, questions, of, method, in, the, psychology, of, thinking, in, 1929, he, obtained, an, authorisation, to, teach, mathematics, and, physics, in, secondary, school, and, began, doing, so, he, married, his, colleague, josefine, anna, henninger, 1906, 1985, in, 1930, fearing, the, rise, of, nazism, and, the, threat, of, the, anschluss, he, started, to, use, the, evenings, and, the, nights, to, write, his, first, book, die, beiden, grundprobleme, der, erkenntnistheorie, the, two, fundamental, problems, of, the, theory, of, knowledge, he, needed, to, publish, a, book, to, get, an, academic, position, in, a, country, that, was, safe, for, people, of, jewish, descent, in, the, end, he, did, not, publish, the, two, volume, work, but, instead, a, condensed, version, with, some, new, material, as, logik, der, forschung, the, logic, of, scientific, discovery, in, 1934, here, he, criticised, psychologism, naturalism, inductivism, and, logical, positivism, and, put, forth, his, theory, of, potential, falsifiability, as, the, criterion, demarcating, science, from, non, science, in, 1935, and, 1936, he, took, unpaid, leave, to, go, to, the, united, kingdom, for, a, study, visit, in, 1937, popper, finally, managed, to, get, a, position, that, allowed, him, to, emigrate, to, new, zealand, where, he, became, lecturer, in, philosophy, at, canterbury, university, college, of, the, university, of, new, zealand, in, christchurch, it, was, here, that, he, wrote, his, influential, work, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, in, dunedin, he, met, the, professor, of, physiology, john, carew, eccles, and, formed, a, lifelong, friendship, with, him, in, 1946, after, the, second, world, war, he, moved, to, the, united, kingdom, to, become, a, reader, in, logic, and, scientific, method, at, the, london, school, of, economics, lse, a, constituent, school, of, the, university, of, london, where, three, years, later, in, 1949, he, was, appointed, professor, of, logic, and, scientific, method, popper, was, president, of, the, aristotelian, society, from, 1958, to, 1959, popper, retired, from, academic, life, in, 1969, though, he, remained, intellectually, active, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1985, he, returned, to, austria, so, that, his, wife, could, have, her, relatives, around, her, during, the, last, months, of, her, life, she, died, in, november, that, year, after, the, ludwig, boltzmann, gesellschaft, failed, to, establish, him, as, the, director, of, a, newly, founded, branch, researching, the, philosophy, of, science, he, went, back, again, to, the, united, kingdom, in, 1986, settling, in, kenley, surrey, popper, died, of, complications, of, cancer, pneumonia, and, kidney, failure, in, kenley, at, the, age, of, 92, on, 17, september, 1994, he, had, been, working, continuously, on, his, philosophy, until, two, weeks, before, when, he, suddenly, fell, terminally, ill, writing, his, last, letter, two, weeks, before, his, death, as, well, after, cremation, his, ashes, were, taken, to, vienna, and, buried, at, lainzer, cemetery, adjacent, to, the, orf, centre, where, his, wife, josefine, anna, popper, called, hennie, had, already, been, buried, popper, s, estate, is, managed, by, his, secretary, and, personal, assistant, melitta, mew, and, her, husband, raymond, popper, s, manuscripts, went, to, the, hoover, institution, at, stanford, university, partly, during, his, lifetime, and, partly, as, supplementary, material, after, his, death, the, university, of, klagenfurt, acquired, popper, s, library, in, 1995, the, karl, popper, archives, was, established, within, the, klagenfurt, university, library, holding, popper, s, library, of, approximately, 6, 000, books, including, his, precious, bibliophilia, as, well, as, hard, copies, of, the, original, hoover, material, and, microfilms, of, the, incremental, material, the, library, as, well, as, various, other, partial, collections, are, open, for, researcher, purposes, the, remaining, parts, of, the, estate, were, mostly, transferred, to, the, karl, popper, charitable, trust, in, october, 2008, the, university, of, klagenfurt, acquired, the, copyrights, from, the, estate, popper, won, many, awards, and, honours, in, his, field, including, the, lippincott, award, of, the, american, political, science, association, the, sonning, prize, the, otto, hahn, peace, medal, of, the, united, nations, association, of, germany, in, berlin, and, fellowships, in, the, royal, society, british, academy, london, school, of, economics, king, s, college, london, darwin, college, cambridge, austrian, academy, of, sciences, and, charles, university, prague, austria, awarded, him, the, grand, decoration, of, honour, in, gold, for, services, to, the, republic, of, austria, in, 1986, and, the, federal, republic, of, germany, its, grand, cross, with, star, and, sash, of, the, order, of, merit, and, the, peace, class, of, the, order, pour, le, m, rite, he, was, knighted, by, queen, elizabeth, ii, in, 1965, and, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, 1976, he, was, invested, with, the, insignia, of, a, member, of, the, order, of, the, companions, of, honour, in, 1982, other, awards, and, recognition, for, popper, included, the, city, of, vienna, prize, for, the, humanities, 1965, karl, renner, prize, 1978, austrian, decoration, for, science, and, art, 1980, dr, leopold, lucas, prize, of, the, university, of, t, bingen, 1980, ring, of, honour, of, the, city, of, vienna, 1983, and, the, premio, internazionale, of, the, italian, federico, nietzsche, society, 1988, in, 1989, he, was, the, first, awarded, the, prize, international, catalonia, for, his, work, to, develop, cultural, scientific, and, human, values, all, around, the, world, in, 1992, he, was, awarded, the, kyoto, prize, in, arts, and, philosophy, for, symbolising, the, open, spirit, of, the, 20th, century, and, for, his, enormous, influence, on, the, formation, of, the, modern, intellectual, climate, popper, s, rejection, of, marxism, during, his, teenage, years, left, a, profound, mark, on, his, thought, he, had, at, one, point, joined, a, socialist, association, and, for, a, few, months, in, 1919, considered, himself, a, communist, although, it, is, known, that, popper, worked, as, an, office, boy, at, the, communist, headquarters, whether, or, not, he, ever, became, a, member, of, the, communist, party, is, unclear, during, this, time, he, became, familiar, with, the, marxist, view, of, economics, class, conflict, and, history, although, he, quickly, became, disillusioned, with, the, views, expounded, by, marxists, his, flirtation, with, the, ideology, led, him, to, distance, himself, from, those, who, believed, that, spilling, blood, for, the, sake, of, a, revolution, was, necessary, he, then, took, the, view, that, when, it, came, to, sacrificing, human, lives, one, was, to, think, and, act, with, extreme, prudence, the, failure, of, democratic, parties, to, prevent, fascism, from, taking, over, austrian, politics, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, traumatised, popper, he, suffered, from, the, direct, consequences, of, this, failure, since, events, after, the, anschluss, the, annexation, of, austria, by, the, german, reich, in, 1938, forced, him, into, permanent, exile, his, most, important, works, in, the, field, of, social, science, the, poverty, of, historicism, 1944, and, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, 1945, were, inspired, by, his, reflection, on, the, events, of, his, time, and, represented, in, a, sense, a, reaction, to, the, prevalent, totalitarian, ideologies, that, then, dominated, central, european, politics, his, books, defended, democratic, liberalism, as, a, social, and, political, philosophy, they, also, represented, extensive, critiques, of, the, philosophical, presuppositions, underpinning, all, forms, of, totalitarianism, popper, believed, that, there, was, a, contrast, between, the, theories, of, sigmund, freud, and, alfred, adler, which, he, considered, non, scientific, and, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, which, set, off, the, revolution, in, physics, in, the, early, 20th, century, popper, thought, that, einstein, s, theory, as, a, theory, properly, grounded, in, scientific, thought, and, method, was, highly, risky, in, the, sense, that, it, was, possible, to, deduce, consequences, from, it, which, differed, considerably, from, those, of, the, then, dominant, newtonian, physics, one, such, prediction, that, gravity, could, deflect, light, was, verified, by, eddington, s, experiments, in, 1919, in, contrast, he, thought, that, nothing, could, even, in, principle, falsify, psychoanalytic, theories, he, thus, came, to, the, conclusion, that, they, had, more, in, common, with, primitive, myths, than, with, genuine, science, this, led, popper, to, conclude, that, what, was, regarded, as, the, remarkable, strengths, of, psychoanalytical, theories, were, actually, their, weaknesses, psychoanalytical, theories, were, crafted, in, a, way, that, made, them, able, to, refute, any, criticism, and, to, give, an, explanation, for, every, possible, form, of, human, behaviour, the, nature, of, such, theories, made, it, impossible, for, any, criticism, or, experiment, even, in, principle, to, show, them, to, be, false, when, popper, later, tackled, the, problem, of, demarcation, in, the, philosophy, of, science, this, conclusion, led, him, to, posit, that, the, strength, of, a, scientific, theory, lies, in, its, both, being, susceptible, to, falsification, and, not, actually, being, falsified, by, criticism, made, of, it, he, considered, that, if, a, theory, cannot, in, principle, be, falsified, by, criticism, it, is, not, a, scientific, theory, popper, coined, the, term, critical, rationalism, to, describe, his, philosophy, popper, rejected, the, empiricist, view, following, from, kant, that, basic, statements, are, infallible, rather, according, to, popper, they, are, descriptions, in, relation, to, a, theoretical, framework, concerning, the, method, of, science, the, term, critical, rationalism, indicates, his, rejection, of, classical, empiricism, and, the, classical, observationalist, inductivist, account, of, science, that, had, grown, out, of, it, popper, argued, strongly, against, the, latter, holding, that, scientific, theories, are, abstract, in, nature, and, can, be, tested, only, indirectly, by, reference, to, their, implications, he, also, held, that, scientific, theory, and, human, knowledge, generally, is, irreducibly, conjectural, or, hypothetical, and, is, generated, by, the, creative, imagination, to, solve, problems, that, have, arisen, in, specific, historico, cultural, settings, logically, no, number, of, positive, outcomes, at, the, level, of, experimental, testing, can, confirm, a, scientific, theory, but, a, single, counterexample, is, logically, decisive, it, shows, the, theory, from, which, the, implication, is, derived, to, be, false, popper, s, account, of, the, logical, asymmetry, between, verification, and, falsifiability, lies, at, the, heart, of, his, philosophy, of, science, it, also, inspired, him, to, take, falsifiability, as, his, criterion, of, demarcation, between, what, is, and, is, not, genuinely, scientific, a, theory, should, be, considered, scientific, if, and, only, if, it, is, falsifiable, this, led, him, to, attack, the, claims, of, both, psychoanalysis, and, contemporary, marxism, to, scientific, status, on, the, basis, that, their, theories, are, not, falsifiable, to, say, that, a, given, statement, e, g, the, statement, of, a, law, of, some, scientific, theory, call, it, t, is, falsifiable, does, not, mean, that, t, is, false, it, means, only, that, the, background, knowledge, about, existing, technologies, which, exists, before, and, independently, of, the, theory, allows, the, imagination, or, conceptualization, of, observations, that, are, in, contradiction, with, the, theory, it, is, only, required, that, these, contradictory, observations, can, potentially, be, observed, with, existing, technologies, the, observations, must, be, inter, subjective, this, is, the, material, requirement, of, falsifiability, alan, chalmers, gives, the, brick, fell, upward, when, released, as, an, example, of, an, imaginary, observation, that, shows, that, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, is, falsifiable, in, all, life, is, problem, solving, popper, sought, to, explain, the, apparent, progress, of, scientific, knowledge, that, is, how, it, is, that, our, understanding, of, the, universe, seems, to, improve, over, time, this, problem, arises, from, his, position, that, the, truth, content, of, our, theories, even, the, best, of, them, cannot, be, verified, by, scientific, testing, but, can, only, be, falsified, with, only, falsifications, being, possible, logically, how, can, we, explain, the, growth, of, knowledge, in, popper, s, view, the, advance, of, scientific, knowledge, is, an, evolutionary, process, characterised, by, his, formula, p, s, 1, t, t, 1, e, e, 1, p, s, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, ps, 1, rightarrow, mathrm, tt, 1, rightarrow, mathrm, ee, 1, rightarrow, mathrm, ps, 2, in, response, to, a, given, problem, situation, p, s, 1, displaystyle, mathrm, ps, 1, a, number, of, competing, conjectures, or, tentative, theories, t, t, displaystyle, mathrm, tt, are, systematically, subjected, to, the, most, rigorous, attempts, at, falsification, possible, this, process, error, elimination, e, e, displaystyle, mathrm, ee, performs, a, similar, function, for, science, that, natural, selection, performs, for, biological, evolution, theories, that, better, survive, the, process, of, refutation, are, not, more, true, but, rather, more, fit, in, other, words, more, applicable, to, the, problem, situation, at, hand, p, s, 1, displaystyle, mathrm, ps, 1, consequently, just, as, a, species, biological, fitness, does, not, ensure, continued, survival, neither, does, rigorous, testing, protect, a, scientific, theory, from, refutation, in, the, future, yet, as, it, appears, that, the, engine, of, biological, evolution, has, over, many, generations, produced, adaptive, traits, equipped, to, deal, with, more, and, more, complex, problems, of, survival, likewise, the, evolution, of, theories, through, the, scientific, method, may, in, popper, s, view, reflect, a, certain, type, of, progress, toward, more, and, more, interesting, problems, p, s, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, ps, 2, for, popper, it, is, in, the, interplay, between, the, tentative, theories, conjectures, and, error, elimination, refutation, that, scientific, knowledge, advances, toward, greater, and, greater, problems, in, a, process, very, much, akin, to, the, interplay, between, genetic, variation, and, natural, selection, popper, also, wrote, extensively, against, the, famous, copenhagen, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, he, strongly, disagreed, with, niels, bohr, s, instrumentalism, and, supported, albert, einstein, s, realist, approach, to, scientific, theories, about, the, universe, he, found, that, bohr, s, interpretation, introduced, subjectivity, into, physics, claiming, later, in, his, life, that, bohr, was, a, marvelous, physicist, one, of, the, greatest, of, all, time, but, he, was, a, miserable, philosopher, and, one, couldn, t, talk, to, him, he, was, talking, all, the, time, allowing, practically, only, one, or, two, words, to, you, and, then, at, once, cutting, in, this, popper, s, falsifiability, resembles, charles, peirce, s, nineteenth, century, fallibilism, in, of, clocks, and, clouds, 1966, popper, remarked, that, he, wished, he, had, known, of, peirce, s, work, earlier, among, his, contributions, to, philosophy, is, his, claim, to, have, solved, the, philosophical, problem, of, induction, he, states, that, while, there, is, no, way, to, prove, that, the, sun, will, rise, it, is, possible, to, formulate, the, theory, that, every, day, the, sun, will, rise, if, it, does, not, rise, on, some, particular, day, the, theory, will, be, falsified, and, will, have, to, be, replaced, by, a, different, one, until, that, day, there, is, no, need, to, reject, the, assumption, that, the, theory, is, true, nor, is, it, rational, according, to, popper, to, make, instead, the, more, complex, assumption, that, the, sun, will, rise, until, a, given, day, but, will, stop, doing, so, the, day, after, or, similar, statements, with, additional, conditions, such, a, theory, would, be, true, with, higher, probability, because, it, cannot, be, attacked, so, easily, popper, held, that, it, is, the, least, likely, or, most, easily, falsifiable, or, simplest, theory, attributes, which, he, identified, as, all, the, same, thing, that, explains, known, facts, that, one, should, rationally, prefer, his, opposition, to, positivism, which, held, that, it, is, the, theory, most, likely, to, be, true, that, one, should, prefer, here, becomes, very, apparent, it, is, impossible, popper, argues, to, ensure, a, theory, to, be, true, it, is, more, important, that, its, falsity, can, be, detected, as, easily, as, possible, popper, agreed, with, david, hume, that, there, is, often, a, psychological, belief, that, the, sun, will, rise, tomorrow, and, that, there, is, no, logical, justification, for, the, supposition, that, it, will, simply, because, it, always, has, in, the, past, popper, writes, i, approached, the, problem, of, induction, through, hume, hume, i, felt, was, perfectly, right, in, pointing, out, that, induction, cannot, be, logically, justified, popper, held, that, rationality, is, not, restricted, to, the, realm, of, empirical, or, scientific, theories, but, that, it, is, merely, a, special, case, of, the, general, method, of, criticism, the, method, of, finding, and, eliminating, contradictions, in, knowledge, without, ad, hoc, measures, according, to, this, view, rational, discussion, about, metaphysical, ideas, about, moral, values, and, even, about, purposes, is, possible, popper, s, student, w, w, bartley, iii, tried, to, radicalise, this, idea, and, made, the, controversial, claim, that, not, only, can, criticism, go, beyond, empirical, knowledge, but, that, everything, can, be, rationally, criticised, to, popper, who, was, an, anti, justificationist, traditional, philosophy, is, misled, by, the, false, principle, of, sufficient, reason, he, thinks, that, no, assumption, can, ever, be, or, needs, ever, to, be, justified, so, a, lack, of, justification, is, not, a, justification, for, doubt, instead, theories, should, be, tested, and, scrutinised, it, is, not, the, goal, to, bless, theories, with, claims, of, certainty, or, justification, but, to, eliminate, errors, in, them, he, writes, here, are, no, such, things, as, good, positive, reasons, nor, do, we, need, such, things, but, obviously, cannot, quite, bring, to, believe, that, this, is, my, opinion, let, alone, that, it, is, right, the, philosophy, of, karl, popper, p, 1043, popper, s, principle, of, falsifiability, runs, into, prima, facie, difficulties, when, the, epistemological, status, of, mathematics, is, considered, it, is, difficult, to, conceive, how, simple, statements, of, arithmetic, such, as, 2, 2, 4, could, ever, be, shown, to, be, false, if, they, are, not, open, to, falsification, they, can, not, be, scientific, if, they, are, not, scientific, it, needs, to, be, explained, how, they, can, be, informative, about, real, world, objects, and, events, popper, s, solution, was, an, original, contribution, in, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, his, idea, was, that, a, number, statement, such, as, 2, apples, 2, apples, 4, apples, can, be, taken, in, two, senses, in, its, pure, mathematics, sense, 2, 2, 4, is, logically, true, and, cannot, be, refuted, contrastingly, in, its, applied, mathematics, sense, of, it, describing, the, physical, behaviour, of, apples, it, can, be, falsified, this, can, be, done, by, placing, two, apples, in, a, container, then, proceeding, to, place, another, two, apples, in, the, same, container, if, there, are, five, three, or, a, number, of, apples, that, is, not, four, in, said, container, the, theory, that, 2, apples, 2, apples, 4, apples, is, shown, to, be, false, on, the, contrary, if, there, are, four, apples, in, the, container, the, theory, of, numbers, is, shown, to, be, applicable, to, reality, in, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, and, the, poverty, of, historicism, popper, developed, a, critique, of, historicism, and, a, defence, of, the, open, society, popper, considered, historicism, to, be, the, theory, that, history, develops, inexorably, and, necessarily, according, to, knowable, general, laws, towards, a, determinate, end, he, argued, that, this, view, is, the, principal, theoretical, presupposition, underpinning, most, forms, of, authoritarianism, and, totalitarianism, he, argued, that, historicism, is, founded, upon, mistaken, assumptions, regarding, the, nature, of, scientific, law, and, prediction, since, the, growth, of, human, knowledge, is, a, causal, factor, in, the, evolution, of, human, history, and, since, no, society, can, predict, scientifically, its, own, future, states, of, knowledge, it, follows, he, argued, that, there, can, be, no, predictive, science, of, human, history, for, popper, metaphysical, and, historical, indeterminism, go, hand, in, hand, in, his, early, years, popper, was, impressed, by, marxism, whether, of, communists, or, socialists, an, event, that, happened, in, 1919, had, a, profound, effect, on, him, during, a, riot, caused, by, the, communists, the, police, shot, several, unarmed, people, including, some, of, popper, s, friends, when, they, tried, to, free, party, comrades, from, prison, the, riot, had, in, fact, been, part, of, a, plan, by, which, leaders, of, the, communist, party, with, connections, to, b, la, kun, tried, to, take, power, by, a, coup, popper, did, not, know, about, this, at, that, time, however, he, knew, that, the, riot, instigators, were, swayed, by, the, marxist, doctrine, that, class, struggle, would, produce, vastly, more, dead, men, than, the, inevitable, revolution, brought, about, as, quickly, as, possible, and, so, had, no, scruples, to, put, the, life, of, the, rioters, at, risk, to, achieve, their, selfish, goal, of, becoming, the, future, leaders, of, the, working, class, this, was, the, start, of, his, later, criticism, of, historicism, popper, began, to, reject, marxist, historicism, which, he, associated, with, questionable, means, and, later, socialism, which, he, associated, with, placing, equality, before, freedom, to, the, possible, disadvantage, of, equality, popper, said, that, he, was, a, socialist, for, several, years, and, maintained, an, interest, in, egalitarianism, but, abandoned, it, as, a, whole, because, socialism, was, a, beautiful, dream, but, just, like, egalitarianism, it, was, incompatible, with, individual, liberty, popper, initially, saw, totalitarianism, as, exclusively, right, wing, in, nature, although, as, early, as, 1945, in, the, open, society, he, was, describing, communist, parties, as, giving, a, weak, opposition, to, fascism, due, to, shared, historicism, with, fascism, 730, over, time, primarily, in, defence, of, liberal, democracy, popper, began, to, see, soviet, type, communism, as, a, form, of, totalitarianism, and, viewed, the, main, issue, of, the, cold, war, as, not, capitalism, versus, socialism, but, democracy, versus, totalitarianism, 732, in, 1957, popper, would, dedicate, the, poverty, of, historicism, to, memory, of, the, countless, men, women, and, children, of, all, creeds, or, nations, or, races, who, fell, victims, to, the, fascist, and, communist, belief, in, inexorable, laws, of, historical, destiny, in, 1947, popper, co, founded, the, mont, pelerin, society, with, friedrich, hayek, milton, friedman, ludwig, von, mises, and, others, although, he, did, not, fully, agree, with, the, think, tank, s, charter, and, ideology, specifically, he, unsuccessfully, recommended, that, socialists, should, be, invited, to, participate, and, that, emphasis, should, be, put, on, a, hierarchy, of, humanitarian, values, rather, than, advocacy, of, a, free, market, as, envisioned, by, classical, liberalism, although, popper, was, an, advocate, of, toleration, he, also, warned, against, unlimited, tolerance, in, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, he, argued, unlimited, tolerance, must, lead, to, the, disappearance, of, tolerance, if, we, extend, unlimited, tolerance, even, to, those, who, are, intolerant, if, we, are, not, prepared, to, defend, a, tolerant, society, against, the, onslaught, of, the, intolerant, then, the, tolerant, will, be, destroyed, and, tolerance, with, them, in, this, formulation, i, do, not, imply, for, instance, that, we, should, always, suppress, the, utterance, of, intolerant, philosophies, as, long, as, we, can, counter, them, by, rational, argument, and, keep, them, in, check, by, public, opinion, suppression, would, certainly, be, most, unwise, but, we, should, claim, the, right, to, suppress, them, if, necessary, even, by, force, for, it, may, easily, turn, out, that, they, are, not, prepared, to, meet, us, on, the, level, of, rational, argument, but, begin, by, denouncing, all, argument, they, may, forbid, their, followers, to, listen, to, rational, argument, because, it, is, deceptive, and, teach, them, to, answer, arguments, by, the, use, of, their, fists, or, pistols, we, should, therefore, claim, in, the, name, of, tolerance, the, right, not, to, tolerate, the, intolerant, we, should, claim, that, any, movement, preaching, intolerance, places, itself, outside, the, law, and, we, should, consider, incitement, to, intolerance, and, persecution, as, criminal, in, the, same, way, as, we, should, consider, incitement, to, murder, or, to, kidnapping, or, to, the, revival, of, the, slave, trade, as, criminal, popper, criticized, what, he, termed, the, conspiracy, theory, of, society, the, view, that, powerful, people, or, groups, godlike, in, their, efficacy, are, responsible, for, purposely, bringing, about, all, the, ills, of, society, this, view, cannot, be, right, popper, argued, because, nothing, ever, comes, off, exactly, as, intended, according, to, philosopher, david, coady, popper, has, often, been, cited, by, critics, of, conspiracy, theories, and, his, views, on, the, topic, continue, to, constitute, an, orthodoxy, in, some, circles, however, philosopher, charles, pigden, has, pointed, out, that, popper, s, argument, only, applies, to, a, very, extreme, kind, of, conspiracy, theory, not, to, conspiracy, theories, generally, as, early, as, 1934, popper, wrote, of, the, search, for, truth, as, one, of, the, strongest, motives, for, scientific, discovery, still, he, describes, in, objective, knowledge, 1972, early, concerns, about, the, much, criticised, notion, of, truth, as, correspondence, then, came, the, semantic, theory, of, truth, formulated, by, the, logician, alfred, tarski, and, published, in, 1933, popper, wrote, of, learning, in, 1935, of, the, consequences, of, tarski, s, theory, to, his, intense, joy, the, theory, met, critical, objections, to, truth, as, correspondence, and, thereby, rehabilitated, it, the, theory, also, seemed, in, popper, s, eyes, to, support, metaphysical, realism, and, the, regulative, idea, of, a, search, for, truth, according, to, this, theory, the, conditions, for, the, truth, of, a, sentence, as, well, as, the, sentences, themselves, are, part, of, a, metalanguage, so, for, example, the, sentence, snow, is, white, is, true, if, and, only, if, snow, is, white, although, many, philosophers, have, interpreted, and, continue, to, interpret, tarski, s, theory, as, a, deflationary, theory, popper, refers, to, it, as, a, theory, in, which, is, true, is, replaced, with, corresponds, to, the, facts, he, bases, this, interpretation, on, the, fact, that, examples, such, as, the, one, described, above, refer, to, two, things, assertions, and, the, facts, to, which, they, refer, he, identifies, tarski, s, formulation, of, the, truth, conditions, of, sentences, as, the, introduction, of, a, metalinguistic, predicate, and, distinguishes, the, following, cases, the, first, case, belongs, to, the, metalanguage, whereas, the, second, is, more, likely, to, belong, to, the, object, language, hence, it, is, true, that, possesses, the, logical, status, of, a, redundancy, is, true, on, the, other, hand, is, a, predicate, necessary, for, making, general, observations, such, as, john, was, telling, the, truth, about, phillip, upon, this, basis, along, with, that, of, the, logical, content, of, assertions, where, logical, content, is, inversely, proportional, to, probability, popper, went, on, to, develop, his, important, notion, of, verisimilitude, or, truthlikeness, the, intuitive, idea, behind, verisimilitude, is, that, the, assertions, or, hypotheses, of, scientific, theories, can, be, objectively, measured, with, respect, to, the, amount, of, truth, and, falsity, that, they, imply, and, in, this, way, one, theory, can, be, evaluated, as, more, or, less, true, than, another, on, a, quantitative, basis, which, popper, emphasises, forcefully, has, nothing, to, do, with, subjective, probabilities, or, other, merely, epistemic, considerations, the, simplest, mathematical, formulation, that, popper, gives, of, this, concept, can, be, found, in, the, tenth, chapter, of, conjectures, and, refutations, here, he, defines, it, as, where, v, s, a, displaystyle, mathit, vs, a, is, the, verisimilitude, of, a, c, t, v, a, displaystyle, mathit, ct, v, a, is, a, measure, of, the, content, of, the, truth, of, a, and, c, t, f, a, displaystyle, mathit, ct, f, a, is, a, measure, of, the, content, of, the, falsity, of, a, popper, s, original, attempt, to, define, not, just, verisimilitude, but, an, actual, measure, of, it, turned, out, to, be, inadequate, however, it, inspired, a, wealth, of, new, attempts, knowledge, for, popper, was, objective, both, in, the, sense, that, it, is, objectively, true, or, truthlike, and, also, in, the, sense, that, knowledge, has, an, ontological, status, i, e, knowledge, as, object, independent, of, the, knowing, subject, objective, knowledge, an, evolutionary, approach, 1972, he, proposed, three, worlds, world, one, being, the, physical, world, or, physical, states, world, two, being, the, world, of, mind, or, mental, states, ideas, and, perceptions, and, world, three, being, the, body, of, human, knowledge, expressed, in, its, manifold, forms, or, the, products, of, the, second, world, made, manifest, in, the, materials, of, the, first, world, i, e, books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and, all, the, products, of, the, human, mind, world, three, he, argued, was, the, product, of, individual, human, beings, in, exactly, the, same, sense, that, an, animal, s, path, is, the, product, of, individual, animals, and, thus, has, an, existence, and, is, evolution, independent, of, any, individually, known, subjects, the, influence, of, world, three, in, his, view, on, the, individual, human, mind, world, two, is, at, least, as, strong, as, the, influence, of, world, one, in, other, words, the, knowledge, held, by, a, given, individual, mind, owes, at, least, as, much, to, the, total, accumulated, wealth, of, human, knowledge, made, manifest, as, to, the, world, of, direct, experience, as, such, the, growth, of, human, knowledge, could, be, said, to, be, a, function, of, the, independent, evolution, of, world, three, many, contemporary, philosophers, such, as, daniel, dennett, have, not, embraced, popper, s, three, world, conjecture, mostly, due, to, its, resemblance, to, mind, body, dualism, the, creation, evolution, controversy, raised, the, issue, of, whether, creationistic, ideas, may, be, legitimately, called, science, in, the, debate, both, sides, and, even, courts, in, their, decisions, have, invoked, popper, s, criterion, of, falsifiability, see, daubert, standard, in, this, context, passages, written, by, popper, are, frequently, quoted, in, which, he, speaks, about, such, issues, himself, for, example, he, famously, stated, darwinism, is, not, a, testable, scientific, theory, but, a, metaphysical, research, program, a, possible, framework, for, testable, scientific, theories, he, continued, and, yet, the, theory, is, invaluable, i, do, not, see, how, without, it, our, knowledge, could, have, grown, as, it, has, done, since, darwin, in, trying, to, explain, experiments, with, bacteria, which, become, adapted, to, say, penicillin, it, is, quite, clear, that, we, are, greatly, helped, by, the, theory, of, natural, selection, although, it, is, metaphysical, it, sheds, much, light, upon, very, concrete, and, very, practical, researches, it, allows, us, to, study, adaptation, to, a, new, environment, such, as, a, penicillin, infested, environment, in, a, rational, way, it, suggests, the, existence, of, a, mechanism, of, adaptation, and, it, allows, us, even, to, study, in, detail, the, mechanism, at, work, he, noted, that, theism, presented, as, explaining, adaptation, was, worse, than, an, open, admission, of, failure, for, it, created, the, impression, that, an, ultimate, explanation, had, been, reached, popper, later, said, when, speaking, here, of, darwinism, this, is, an, immensely, impressive, and, powerful, theory, the, claim, that, it, completely, explains, evolution, is, of, course, a, bold, claim, and, very, far, from, being, established, all, scientific, theories, are, conjectures, even, those, that, have, successfully, passed, many, severe, and, varied, tests, the, mendelian, underpinning, of, modern, darwinism, has, been, well, tested, and, so, has, the, theory, of, evolution, he, explained, that, the, difficulty, of, testing, had, led, some, people, to, describe, natural, selection, as, a, tautology, and, that, he, too, had, in, the, past, described, the, theory, as, almost, tautological, and, had, tried, to, explain, how, the, theory, could, be, untestable, as, is, a, tautology, and, yet, of, great, scientific, interest, my, solution, was, that, the, doctrine, of, natural, selection, is, a, most, successful, metaphysical, research, programme, it, raises, detailed, problems, in, many, fields, and, it, tells, us, what, we, would, expect, of, an, acceptable, solution, of, these, problems, i, still, believe, that, natural, selection, works, in, this, way, as, a, research, programme, nevertheless, i, have, changed, my, mind, about, the, testability, and, logical, status, of, the, theory, of, natural, selection, and, i, am, glad, to, have, an, opportunity, to, make, a, recantation, popper, summarised, his, new, view, as, follows, the, theory, of, natural, selection, may, be, so, formulated, that, it, is, far, from, tautological, in, this, case, it, is, not, only, testable, but, it, turns, out, to, be, not, strictly, universally, true, there, seem, to, be, exceptions, as, with, so, many, biological, theories, and, considering, the, random, character, of, the, variations, on, which, natural, selection, operates, the, occurrence, of, exceptions, is, not, surprising, thus, not, all, phenomena, of, evolution, are, explained, by, natural, selection, alone, yet, in, every, particular, case, it, is, a, challenging, research, program, to, show, how, far, natural, selection, can, possibly, be, held, responsible, for, the, evolution, of, a, particular, organ, or, behavioural, program, these, frequently, quoted, passages, are, only, a, small, part, of, what, popper, wrote, on, evolution, however, and, may, give, the, wrong, impression, that, he, mainly, discussed, questions, of, its, falsifiability, popper, never, invented, this, criterion, to, give, justifiable, use, of, words, like, science, in, fact, popper, stressed, that, the, last, thing, i, wish, to, do, however, is, to, advocate, another, dogma, and, that, what, is, to, be, called, a, science, and, who, is, to, be, called, a, scientist, must, always, remain, a, matter, of, convention, or, decision, he, quotes, menger, s, dictum, that, definitions, are, dogmas, only, the, conclusions, drawn, from, them, can, afford, us, any, new, insight, and, notes, that, different, definitions, of, science, can, be, rationally, debated, and, compared, i, do, not, try, to, justify, however, by, representing, them, as, the, true, or, the, essential, aims, of, science, this, would, only, distort, the, issue, and, it, would, mean, a, relapse, into, positivist, dogmatism, there, is, only, one, way, as, far, as, i, can, see, of, arguing, rationally, in, support, of, my, proposals, this, is, to, analyse, their, logical, consequences, to, point, out, their, fertility, their, power, to, elucidate, the, problems, of, the, theory, of, knowledge, popper, had, his, own, sophisticated, views, on, evolution, that, go, much, beyond, what, the, frequently, quoted, passages, say, in, effect, popper, agreed, with, some, points, of, both, creationists, and, naturalists, but, disagreed, with, both, on, crucial, aspects, popper, understood, the, universe, as, a, creative, entity, that, invents, new, things, including, life, but, without, the, necessity, of, something, like, a, god, especially, not, one, who, is, pulling, strings, from, behind, the, curtain, he, said, that, evolution, of, the, genotype, must, as, the, creationists, say, work, in, a, goal, directed, way, but, disagreed, with, their, view, that, it, must, necessarily, be, the, hand, of, god, that, imposes, these, goals, onto, the, stage, of, life, instead, he, formulated, the, spearhead, model, of, evolution, a, version, of, genetic, pluralism, according, to, this, living, organisms, have, goals, and, act, according, to, these, goals, each, guided, by, a, central, control, in, its, most, sophisticated, form, this, is, the, brain, of, humans, but, controls, also, exist, in, much, less, sophisticated, ways, for, species, of, lower, complexity, such, as, the, amoeba, this, control, organ, plays, a, special, role, in, evolution, it, is, the, spearhead, of, evolution, the, goals, bring, the, purpose, into, the, world, mutations, in, the, genes, that, determine, the, structure, of, the, control, may, then, cause, drastic, changes, in, behaviour, preferences, and, goals, without, having, an, impact, on, the, organism, s, phenotype, popper, postulates, that, such, purely, behavioural, changes, are, less, likely, to, be, lethal, for, the, organism, compared, to, drastic, changes, of, the, phenotype, popper, contrasts, his, views, with, the, notion, of, the, hopeful, monster, that, has, large, phenotype, mutations, and, calls, it, the, hopeful, behavioural, monster, after, behaviour, has, changed, radically, small, but, quick, changes, of, the, phenotype, follow, to, make, the, organism, fitter, to, its, changed, goals, this, way, it, looks, as, if, the, phenotype, were, changing, guided, by, some, invisible, hand, while, it, is, merely, natural, selection, working, in, combination, with, the, new, behaviour, for, example, according, to, this, hypothesis, the, eating, habits, of, the, giraffe, must, have, changed, before, its, elongated, neck, evolved, popper, contrasted, this, view, as, evolution, from, within, or, active, darwinism, the, organism, actively, trying, to, discover, new, ways, of, life, and, being, on, a, quest, for, conquering, new, ecological, niches, with, the, naturalistic, evolution, from, without, which, has, the, picture, of, a, hostile, environment, only, trying, to, kill, the, mostly, passive, organism, or, perhaps, segregate, some, of, its, groups, popper, was, a, key, figure, encouraging, patent, lawyer, g, nter, w, chtersh, user, to, publish, his, iron, sulfur, world, hypothesis, on, abiogenesis, and, his, criticism, of, soup, theory, on, the, creation, evolution, controversy, popper, initially, wrote, that, he, considered, it, a, somewhat, sensational, clash, between, a, brilliant, scientific, hypothesis, concerning, the, history, of, the, various, species, of, animals, and, plants, on, earth, and, an, older, metaphysical, theory, which, incidentally, happened, to, be, part, of, an, established, religious, belief, with, a, footnote, to, the, effect, that, he, agree, with, professor, c, e, raven, when, he, calls, this, conflict, a, storm, in, a, victorian, tea, cup, in, his, later, work, however, when, he, had, developed, his, own, spearhead, model, and, active, darwinism, theories, popper, revised, this, view, and, found, some, validity, in, the, controversy, i, have, to, confess, that, this, cup, of, tea, has, become, after, all, my, cup, of, tea, and, with, it, i, have, to, eat, humble, pie, popper, and, john, eccles, speculated, on, the, problem, of, free, will, for, many, years, generally, agreeing, on, an, interactionist, dualist, theory, of, mind, however, although, popper, was, a, body, mind, dualist, he, did, not, think, that, the, mind, is, a, substance, separate, from, the, body, he, thought, that, mental, or, psychological, properties, or, aspects, of, people, are, distinct, from, physical, ones, when, he, gave, the, second, arthur, holly, compton, memorial, lecture, in, 1965, popper, revisited, the, idea, of, quantum, indeterminacy, as, a, source, of, human, freedom, eccles, had, suggested, that, critically, poised, neurons, might, be, influenced, by, the, mind, to, assist, in, a, decision, popper, criticised, compton, s, idea, of, amplified, quantum, events, affecting, the, decision, he, wrote, the, idea, that, the, only, alternative, to, determinism, is, just, sheer, chance, was, taken, over, by, schlick, together, with, many, of, his, views, on, the, subject, from, hume, who, asserted, that, the, removal, of, what, he, called, physical, necessity, must, always, result, in, the, same, thing, with, chance, as, objects, must, either, be, conjoin, d, or, not, tis, impossible, to, admit, of, any, medium, betwixt, chance, and, an, absolute, necessity, i, shall, later, argue, against, this, important, doctrine, according, to, which, the, alternative, to, determinism, is, sheer, chance, yet, i, must, admit, that, the, doctrine, seems, to, hold, good, for, the, quantum, theoretical, models, which, have, been, designed, to, explain, or, at, least, to, illustrate, the, possibility, of, human, freedom, this, seems, to, be, the, reason, why, these, models, are, so, very, unsatisfactory, hume, s, and, schlick, s, ontological, thesis, that, there, cannot, exist, anything, intermediate, between, chance, and, determinism, seems, to, me, not, only, highly, dogmatic, not, to, say, doctrinaire, but, clearly, absurd, and, it, is, understandable, only, on, the, assumption, that, they, believed, in, a, complete, determinism, in, which, chance, has, no, status, except, as, a, symptom, of, our, ignorance, popper, called, not, for, something, between, chance, and, necessity, but, for, a, combination, of, randomness, and, control, to, explain, freedom, though, not, yet, explicitly, in, two, stages, with, random, chance, before, the, controlled, decision, saying, freedom, is, not, just, chance, but, rather, the, result, of, a, subtle, interplay, between, something, almost, random, or, haphazard, and, something, like, a, restrictive, or, selective, control, then, in, his, 1977, book, with, john, eccles, the, self, and, its, brain, popper, finally, formulates, the, two, stage, model, in, a, temporal, sequence, and, he, compares, free, will, to, darwinian, evolution, and, natural, selection, new, ideas, have, a, striking, similarity, to, genetic, mutations, now, let, us, look, for, a, moment, at, genetic, mutations, mutations, are, it, seems, brought, about, by, quantum, theoretical, indeterminacy, including, radiation, effects, accordingly, they, are, also, probabilistic, and, not, in, themselves, originally, selected, or, adequate, but, on, them, there, subsequently, operates, natural, selection, which, eliminates, inappropriate, mutations, now, we, could, conceive, of, a, similar, process, with, respect, to, new, ideas, and, to, free, will, decisions, and, similar, things, that, is, to, say, a, range, of, possibilities, is, brought, about, by, a, probabilistic, and, quantum, mechanically, characterised, set, of, proposals, as, it, were, of, possibilities, brought, forward, by, the, brain, on, these, there, then, operates, a, kind, of, selective, procedure, which, eliminates, those, proposals, and, those, possibilities, which, are, not, acceptable, to, the, mind, popper, was, not, a, religious, man, in, the, formal, sense, of, the, word, he, neither, maintained, any, link, with, his, jewish, ancestry, nor, was, he, an, observant, lutheran, however, he, did, consider, that, every, person, including, himself, was, religious, in, the, sense, of, believing, in, something, more, important, and, beyond, us, through, which, we, can, transcend, ourselves, popper, called, this, something, a, third, world, in, an, interview, that, popper, gave, in, 1969, with, the, condition, that, it, should, be, kept, secret, until, after, his, death, he, summarised, his, position, on, god, as, follows, i, don, t, know, whether, god, exists, or, not, some, forms, of, atheism, are, arrogant, and, ignorant, and, should, be, rejected, but, agnosticism, to, admit, that, we, don, t, know, and, to, search, is, all, right, when, i, look, at, what, i, call, the, gift, of, life, i, feel, a, gratitude, which, is, in, tune, with, some, religious, ideas, of, god, however, the, moment, i, even, speak, of, it, i, am, embarrassed, that, i, may, do, something, wrong, to, god, in, talking, about, god, aged, fifteen, after, reading, spinoza, at, the, suggestion, of, his, father, popper, recounts, that, it, gave, me, a, lifetime, s, dislike, of, theorizing, about, god, he, objected, to, organised, religion, saying, it, tends, to, use, the, name, of, god, in, vain, noting, the, danger, of, fanaticism, because, of, religious, conflicts, the, whole, thing, goes, back, to, myths, which, though, they, may, have, a, kernel, of, truth, are, untrue, why, then, should, the, jewish, myth, be, true, and, the, indian, and, egyptian, myths, not, be, true, ethical, issues, always, constituted, an, important, part, of, the, background, to, popper, s, philosophy, in, later, life, he, discussed, ethics, rarely, and, religious, questions, hardly, at, all, but, he, sympathized, with, the, religious, stance, of, others, and, was, not, prepared, to, endorse, various, humanist, and, secular, offensives, for, popper, religion, was, definitely, not, science, but, because, something, isn, t, science, however, does, not, mean, it, is, meaningless, in, a, letter, unrelated, to, the, interview, he, stressed, his, tolerant, attitude, although, i, am, not, for, religion, i, do, think, that, we, should, show, respect, for, anybody, who, believes, honestly, popper, helped, to, establish, the, philosophy, of, science, as, an, autonomous, discipline, within, philosophy, both, through, his, own, prolific, and, influential, works, and, through, his, influence, on, his, contemporaries, and, students, in, 1946, popper, founded, the, department, of, philosophy, logic, and, scientific, method, at, the, london, school, of, economics, lse, and, there, lectured, and, influenced, both, imre, lakatos, and, paul, feyerabend, two, of, the, foremost, philosophers, of, science, in, the, next, generation, lakatos, significantly, modified, popper, s, position, 1, and, feyerabend, repudiated, it, entirely, but, the, work, of, both, was, deeply, influenced, by, popper, and, engaged, with, many, of, the, problems, that, popper, set, although, there, is, some, dispute, as, to, the, matter, of, influence, popper, had, a, longstanding, and, close, friendship, with, economist, friedrich, hayek, who, was, also, brought, to, lse, from, vienna, each, found, support, and, similarities, in, the, other, s, work, citing, each, other, often, though, not, without, qualification, in, a, letter, to, hayek, in, 1944, popper, stated, i, think, i, have, learnt, more, from, you, than, from, any, other, living, thinker, except, perhaps, alfred, tarski, popper, dedicated, his, conjectures, and, refutations, to, hayek, for, his, part, hayek, dedicated, a, collection, of, papers, studies, in, philosophy, politics, and, economics, to, popper, and, in, 1982, said, ever, since, his, logik, der, forschung, first, came, out, in, 1934, i, have, been, a, complete, adherent, to, his, general, theory, of, methodology, popper, also, had, long, and, mutually, influential, friendships, with, art, historian, ernst, gombrich, biologist, peter, medawar, and, neuroscientist, john, carew, eccles, the, german, jurist, reinhold, zippelius, uses, popper, s, method, of, trial, and, error, in, his, legal, philosophy, peter, medawar, called, him, incomparably, the, greatest, philosopher, of, science, that, has, ever, been, popper, s, influence, both, through, his, work, in, philosophy, of, science, and, through, his, political, philosophy, has, also, extended, beyond, the, academy, one, of, popper, s, students, at, lse, was, george, soros, who, later, became, a, billionaire, investor, and, among, whose, philanthropic, foundations, is, the, open, society, institute, a, think, tank, named, in, honour, of, popper, s, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, soros, revised, his, own, philosophy, differing, from, some, of, popper, s, epistemological, assumptions, in, a, lecture, entitled, open, society, given, at, central, european, university, on, 28, october, 2009, popper, was, mainly, concerned, with, the, problems, of, understanding, of, reality, he, argued, that, and, i, quote, only, democracy, provides, an, institutional, framework, that, permits, reform, without, violence, and, so, the, use, of, reason, in, politics, matters, but, his, approach, was, based, on, a, hidden, assumption, namely, that, the, main, purpose, of, thinking, is, to, gain, a, better, understanding, of, reality, and, that, was, not, necessarily, the, case, the, manipulative, function, could, take, precedence, over, the, cognitive, function, how, could, popper, take, it, for, granted, that, free, political, discourse, is, aimed, at, understanding, reality, and, even, more, intriguingly, how, could, i, who, gave, the, manipulative, function, pride, of, place, in, the, concept, of, reflexivity, follow, him, so, blindly, let, me, spell, out, my, conclusion, more, clearly, an, open, society, is, a, desirable, form, of, social, organization, both, as, a, means, to, an, end, and, an, end, in, itself, provided, it, gives, precedence, to, the, cognitive, over, the, manipulative, function, and, people, are, willing, to, confront, harsh, realities, the, value, of, individual, freedom, is, likely, to, assume, increasing, importance, in, the, immediate, future, most, criticisms, of, popper, s, philosophy, are, of, the, falsification, or, error, elimination, element, in, his, account, of, problem, solving, popper, presents, falsifiability, as, both, an, ideal, and, as, an, important, principle, in, a, practical, method, of, effective, human, problem, solving, as, such, the, current, conclusions, of, science, are, stronger, than, pseudo, sciences, or, non, sciences, insofar, as, they, have, survived, this, particularly, vigorous, selection, method, he, does, not, argue, that, any, such, conclusions, are, therefore, true, or, that, this, describes, the, actual, methods, of, any, particular, scientist, rather, it, is, recommended, as, an, essential, principle, of, methodology, that, if, enacted, by, a, system, or, community, will, lead, to, slow, but, steady, progress, of, a, sort, relative, to, how, well, the, system, or, community, enacts, the, method, it, has, been, suggested, that, popper, s, ideas, are, often, mistaken, for, a, hard, logical, account, of, truth, because, of, the, historical, co, incidence, of, their, appearing, at, the, same, time, as, logical, positivism, the, followers, of, which, mistook, his, aims, for, their, own, the, quine, duhem, thesis, argues, that, it, is, impossible, to, test, a, single, hypothesis, on, its, own, since, each, one, comes, as, part, of, an, environment, of, theories, thus, we, can, only, say, that, the, whole, package, of, relevant, theories, has, been, collectively, falsified, but, cannot, conclusively, say, which, element, of, the, package, must, be, replaced, an, example, of, this, is, given, by, the, discovery, of, the, planet, neptune, when, the, motion, of, uranus, was, found, not, to, match, the, predictions, of, newton, s, laws, the, theory, there, are, seven, planets, in, the, solar, system, was, rejected, and, not, newton, s, laws, themselves, popper, discussed, this, critique, of, naive, falsificationism, in, chapters, 3, and, 4, of, the, logic, of, scientific, discovery, the, philosopher, thomas, kuhn, writes, in, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, 1962, that, he, places, an, emphasis, on, anomalous, experiences, similar, to, that, which, popper, places, on, falsification, however, he, adds, that, anomalous, experiences, cannot, be, identified, with, falsification, and, questions, whether, theories, could, be, falsified, in, the, manner, suggested, by, popper, kuhn, argues, in, the, essential, tension, 1977, that, while, popper, was, correct, that, psychoanalysis, cannot, be, considered, a, science, there, are, better, reasons, for, drawing, that, conclusion, than, those, popper, provided, popper, s, student, imre, lakatos, attempted, to, reconcile, kuhn, s, work, with, falsificationism, by, arguing, that, science, progresses, by, the, falsification, of, research, programs, rather, than, the, more, specific, universal, statements, of, naive, falsificationism, popper, claimed, to, have, recognised, already, in, the, 1934, version, of, his, logic, of, discovery, a, fact, later, stressed, by, kuhn, that, scientists, necessarily, develop, their, ideas, within, a, definite, theoretical, framework, and, to, that, extent, to, have, anticipated, kuhn, s, central, point, about, normal, science, however, popper, criticised, what, he, saw, as, kuhn, s, relativism, this, criticism, being, at, the, heart, of, the, kuhn, popper, debate, also, in, his, collection, conjectures, and, refutations, the, growth, of, scientific, knowledge, harper, row, 1963, popper, writes, science, must, begin, with, myths, and, with, the, criticism, of, myths, neither, with, the, collection, of, observations, nor, with, the, invention, of, experiments, but, with, the, critical, discussion, of, myths, and, of, magical, techniques, and, practices, the, scientific, tradition, is, distinguished, from, the, pre, scientific, tradition, in, having, two, layers, like, the, latter, it, passes, on, its, theories, but, it, also, passes, on, a, critical, attitude, towards, them, the, theories, are, passed, on, not, as, dogmas, but, rather, with, the, challenge, to, discuss, them, and, improve, upon, them, another, objection, is, that, it, is, not, always, possible, to, demonstrate, falsehood, definitively, especially, if, one, is, using, statistical, criteria, to, evaluate, a, null, hypothesis, more, generally, it, is, not, always, clear, if, evidence, contradicts, a, hypothesis, that, this, is, a, sign, of, flaws, in, the, hypothesis, rather, than, of, flaws, in, the, evidence, however, this, is, a, misunderstanding, of, what, popper, s, philosophy, of, science, sets, out, to, do, rather, than, offering, a, set, of, instructions, that, merely, need, to, be, followed, diligently, to, achieve, science, popper, makes, it, clear, in, the, logic, of, scientific, discovery, that, his, belief, is, that, the, resolution, of, conflicts, between, hypotheses, and, observations, can, only, be, a, matter, of, the, collective, judgment, of, scientists, in, each, individual, case, in, science, versus, crime, houck, writes, that, popper, s, falsificationism, can, be, questioned, logically, it, is, not, clear, how, popper, would, deal, with, a, statement, like, for, every, metal, there, is, a, temperature, at, which, it, will, melt, the, hypothesis, cannot, be, falsified, by, any, possible, observation, for, there, will, always, be, a, higher, temperature, than, tested, at, which, the, metal, may, in, fact, melt, yet, it, seems, to, be, a, valid, scientific, hypothesis, these, examples, were, pointed, out, by, carl, gustav, hempel, hempel, came, to, acknowledge, that, logical, positivism, s, verificationism, was, untenable, but, argued, that, falsificationism, was, equally, untenable, on, logical, grounds, alone, the, simplest, response, to, this, is, that, because, popper, describes, how, theories, attain, maintain, and, lose, scientific, status, individual, consequences, of, currently, accepted, scientific, theories, are, scientific, in, the, sense, of, being, part, of, tentative, scientific, knowledge, and, both, of, hempel, s, examples, fall, under, this, category, for, instance, atomic, theory, implies, that, all, metals, melt, at, some, temperature, an, early, adversary, of, popper, s, critical, rationalism, karl, otto, apel, attempted, a, comprehensive, refutation, of, popper, s, philosophy, in, transformation, der, philosophie, 1973, apel, charged, popper, with, being, guilty, of, amongst, other, things, a, pragmatic, contradiction, the, philosopher, adolf, gr, nbaum, argues, in, the, foundations, of, psychoanalysis, 1984, that, popper, s, view, that, psychoanalytic, theories, even, in, principle, cannot, be, falsified, is, incorrect, the, philosopher, roger, scruton, argues, in, sexual, desire, 1986, that, popper, was, mistaken, to, claim, that, freudian, theory, implies, no, testable, observation, and, therefore, does, not, have, genuine, predictive, power, scruton, maintains, that, freudian, theory, has, both, theoretical, terms, and, empirical, content, he, points, to, the, example, of, freud, s, theory, of, repression, which, in, his, view, has, strong, empirical, content, and, implies, testable, consequences, nevertheless, scruton, also, concluded, that, freudian, theory, is, not, genuinely, scientific, the, philosopher, charles, taylor, accuses, popper, of, exploiting, his, worldwide, fame, as, an, epistemologist, to, diminish, the, importance, of, philosophers, of, the, 20th, century, continental, tradition, according, to, taylor, popper, s, criticisms, are, completely, baseless, but, they, are, received, with, an, attention, and, respect, that, popper, s, intrinsic, worth, hardly, merits, the, philosopher, john, gray, argues, that, popper, s, account, of, scientific, method, would, have, prevented, the, theories, of, charles, darwin, and, albert, einstein, from, being, accepted, the, philosopher, and, psychologist, michel, ter, hark, writes, in, popper, otto, selz, and, the, rise, of, evolutionary, epistemology, 2004, that, popper, took, some, of, his, ideas, from, his, tutor, the, german, psychologist, otto, selz, selz, never, published, his, ideas, partly, because, of, the, rise, of, nazism, which, forced, him, to, quit, his, work, in, 1933, and, prohibited, any, reference, to, his, ideas, popper, the, historian, of, ideas, and, his, scholarship, is, criticised, in, some, academic, quarters, for, his, rejection, of, plato, and, hegel
