emperor, menelik, argued, that, while, the, family, of, yohannes, iv, claimed, descent, from, king, solomon, and, the, queen, of, sheba, through, females, of, the, dynasty, his, claim, was, based, on, uninterrupted, direct, male, lineage, which, made, the, claims, of, the, house, of, shewa, equal, to, those, of, the, elder, gondar, line, of, the, dynasty, menelik, and, later, his, daughter, zewditu, would, be, the, last, ethiopian, monarchs, who, could, claim, uninterrupted, direct, male, descent, from, king, solomon, and, the, queen, of, sheba, both, lij, iyasu, and, emperor, haile, selassie, were, in, the, female, line, iyasu, through, his, mother, shewarega, menelik, and, haile, selassie, through, his, paternal, grandmother, tenagnework, sahle, selassie, in, the, end, menelik, was, able, to, obtain, the, allegiance, of, a, large, majority, of, the, ethiopian, nobility, on, 3, november, 1889, menelik, was, consecrated, and, crowned, as, emperor, before, a, glittering, crowd, of, dignitaries, and, clergy, by, abuna, mattewos, bishop, of, shewa, at, the, church, of, mary, on, mount, entoto, the, newly, consecrated, and, crowned, emperor, menelik, ii, quickly, toured, the,

requirements, or, securing, trophies, to, prove, masculinity, menelik, s, clemency, to, ras, mengesha, yohannes, whom, he, made, hereditary, prince, of, his, native, tigray, was, ill, repaid, by, a, long, series, of, revolts, in, 1898, menelik, crushed, a, rebellion, by, ras, mengesha, yohannes, who, died, in, 1906, after, this, menelik, directed, his, efforts, to, the, consolidation, of, his, authority, and, to, a, degree, to, the, opening, up, of, his, country, to, outside, influences, the, league, of, nations, in, 1920, reported, that, after, the, invasion, of, menelik, s, forces, into, non, abyssinian, lands, of, somalis, harari, oromo, sidama, shanqella, etc, the, inhabitants, were, enslaved, and, heavily, taxed, by, the, gabbar, system, leading, to, depopulation, menelik, brought, together, many, of, the, northern, territories, through, political, consensus, the, exception, was, gojjam, which, offered, tribute, to, the, shewan, kingdom, following, its, defeat, at, the, battle, of, embabo, most, of, the, western, and, central, territories, like, jimma, welega, province, and, chebo, surrendered, to, menelik, s, invading, forces, with, no, resistance, native, armed, soldiers,

territories, beginning, in, the, 1870s, menelik, set, off, from, the, central, province, of, shewa, to, reunify, the, lands, and, people, of, the, south, east, and, west, into, an, empire, this, period, of, expansions, has, been, referred, to, by, some, as, the, agar, maqnat, roughly, translating, to, some, type, of, cultivation, of, land, the, people, incorporated, by, menelik, through, conquest, were, the, southerners, oromo, sidama, gurage, wolayta, and, other, groups, 2, historian, raymond, jonas, describes, the, conquest, of, the, emirate, of, harar, by, menelik, as, brutal, in, territories, incorporated, peacefully, like, jimma, leka, and, wolega, the, former, order, was, preserved, and, there, was, no, interference, in, their, self, government, in, areas, incorporated, after, war, the, appointed, new, rulers, did, not, violate, the, peoples, religious, beliefs, and, they, treated, them, lawfully, and, justly, however, in, the, territories, incorporated, by, military, conquest, menelik, s, army, carried, out, atrocities, against, civilians, and, combatants, including, torture, mass, killings, and, large, scale, slavery, large, scale, atrocities, were, also, committed, against, the, dizi, people, and, the, people, of, the, kaficho, kingdom, some, estimates, that, the, number, of, people, killed, as, a, result, of, the, conquest, from, war, famine, and, atrocities, go, into, the, millions, based, on, convergent, subjugation, approaches, cooperation, between, menelik, and, belgian, king, leopold, ii, were, attempted, more, than, once, for, a, period, ethiopia, lacked, a, permanent, capital, instead, the, royal, encampment, served, as, a, roving, capital, for, a, time, menelik, s, camp, was, on, mount, entoto, but, in, 1886, while, menelik, was, on, campaign, in, harar, empress, taytu, betul, camped, at, a, hot, spring, to, the, south, of, mount, entoto, she, decided, to, build, a, house, there, and, from, 1887, this, was, her, permanent, base, which, she, named, addis, ababa, new, flower, menelik, s, generals, were, all, allocated, land, nearby, to, build, their, own, houses, and, in, 1889, work, began, in, a, new, royal, palace, the, city, grew, rapidly, and, by, 1910, the, city, had, around, 70, 000, permanent, inhabitants, with, up, to, 50, 000, more, on, a, temporary, basis, only, in, 1917, after, menelik, s, death, was, the, city, reached, by, the, railway, from, djibouti, during, menelik, s, reign, the, great, famine, of, 1888, to, 1892, which, was, the, worst, famine, in, the, region, s, history, killed, a, third, of, the, total, population, which, was, then, estimated, at, 12, million, the, famine, was, caused, by, rinderpest, an, infectious, viral, cattle, disease, which, wiped, out, most, of, the, national, livestock, killing, over, 90, of, the, cattle, the, native, cattle, population, had, no, prior, exposure, and, were, unable, to, fight, off, the, disease, on, 2, may, 1889, while, claiming, the, throne, against, ras, mengesha, yohannes, the, natural, son, of, emperor, yohannes, iv, menelik, concluded, a, treaty, with, italy, at, wuchale, uccialli, in, italian, in, wollo, province, on, the, signing, of, the, treaty, menelik, said, the, territories, north, of, the, merab, milesh, i, e, eritrea, do, not, belong, to, abyssinia, nor, are, under, my, rule, i, am, the, emperor, of, abyssinia, the, land, referred, to, as, eritrea, is, not, peopled, by, abyssinians, they, are, adals, bejaa, and, tigres, abyssinia, will, defend, his, territories, but, will, not, fight, for, foreign, lands, which, eritrea, is, to, my, knowledge, under, the, treaty, abyssinia, and, kingdom, of, italy, agreed, to, define, the, boundary, between, eritrea, and, ethiopia, for, example, both, ethiopia, and, italy, agreed, that, arafali, halai, segeneiti, and, asmara, are, villages, within, the, italian, border, also, the, italians, agreed, not, to, harass, ethiopian, traders, and, to, allow, safe, passage, for, ethiopian, goods, particularly, military, weapons, the, treaty, also, guaranteed, that, the, ethiopian, government, would, have, ownership, of, the, monastery, of, debre, bizen, but, not, use, it, for, military, purposes, however, there, were, two, versions, of, the, treaty, one, in, italian, and, another, in, amharic, unknown, to, menelik, the, italian, version, gave, italy, more, power, than, the, two, had, agreed, to, the, italians, believed, they, had, tricked, menelik, into, giving, allegiance, to, italy, to, their, surprise, upon, learning, about, the, alteration, emperor, menelik, ii, rejected, the, treaty, the, italians, attempted, to, bribe, him, with, two, million, rounds, of, ammunition, but, he, refused, then, the, italians, approached, ras, mengesha, of, tigray, in, an, attempt, to, create, a, civil, war, however, ras, mengesha, understanding, that, ethiopia, s, independence, was, at, stake, refused, to, be, a, puppet, for, the, italians, the, italians, therefore, prepared, to, attack, ethiopia, with, an, army, led, by, baratieri, subsequently, the, italians, declared, war, and, attempted, to, invade, ethiopia, menelik, s, disagreement, with, article, 17, of, the, treaty, led, to, the, battle, of, adwa, before, italy, could, launch, the, invasion, eritreans, rebelled, in, an, attempt, to, push, italy, out, of, eritrea, and, prevent, its, invasion, of, ethiopia, the, rebellion, was, not, successful, however, some, of, the, eritreans, managed, to, make, their, way, to, the, ethiopian, camp, and, jointly, fought, italy, at, the, battle, of, adwa, on, 17, september, 1895, menelik, ordered, all, of, the, ethiopian, nobility, to, call, out, their, banners, and, raise, their, feudal, hosts, stating, an, enemy, has, come, across, the, sea, he, has, broken, through, our, frontiers, to, destroy, our, fatherland, and, our, faith, i, allowed, him, to, seize, my, possessions, and, i, entered, upon, lengthy, negotiations, with, him, in, hopes, of, obtaining, justice, without, bloodshed, but, the, enemy, refuses, to, listen, he, undermines, our, territories, and, our, people, like, a, mole, enough, with, the, help, of, god, i, will, defend, the, inheritance, of, my, forefathers, and, drive, back, the, invader, by, force, of, arms, let, every, man, who, has, sufficient, strength, accompany, me, and, he, who, has, not, let, him, pray, for, us, menelik, s, opponent, general, oreste, baratieri, underestimated, the, size, of, the, ethiopian, force, predicting, that, menelik, could, only, field, 30, 000, men, despite, the, dismissive, italian, claim, that, ethiopia, was, a, barbaric, african, nation, whose, men, were, no, match, for, white, troops, the, ethiopians, were, better, armed, being, equipped, with, thousands, of, modern, rifles, and, hotchkiss, artillery, guns, together, with, ammunition, and, shells, which, were, superior, to, the, italian, rifles, and, artillery, menelik, had, ensured, that, his, infantry, and, artillerymen, were, properly, trained, in, their, use, giving, the, ethiopians, a, crucial, advantage, as, the, hotchkiss, artillery, could, fire, more, rapidly, than, the, italian, artillery, in, 1887, a, british, diplomat, gerald, portal, wrote, after, seeing, the, ethiopian, feudal, hosts, parade, before, him, the, ethiopians, were, redeemed, by, the, possession, of, unbounded, courage, by, a, disregard, of, death, and, by, a, national, pride, which, leads, them, to, look, down, on, every, human, being, who, has, not, had, the, good, fortune, to, be, born, an, abyssinian, the, emperor, personally, led, his, army, to, attack, an, italian, force, led, by, major, toselli, on, 7, december, 1895, at, boota, hill, the, ethiopians, attacked, a, force, of, 350, eritrean, irregulars, on, the, left, flank, who, collapsed, under, the, ethiopian, assault, causing, toselli, to, send, two, companies, of, italian, infantry, who, halted, the, ethiopian, advance, just, as, toselli, was, rejoicing, in, his, apparent, victory, the, main, ethiopian, assault, came, down, on, his, right, flank, causing, toselli, to, order, a, retreat, the, emperor, s, best, general, ras, makonnen, had, occupied, the, road, leading, back, to, eritrea, and, launched, a, surprise, attack, which, routed, the, italians, the, battle, of, amba, alagi, ended, with, an, italian, force, of, 2, 150, men, losing, 1, 000, men, and, 20, officers, killed, ras, makonnen, followed, up, that, victory, by, defeating, general, arimondi, and, forcing, the, italians, to, retreat, to, the, fort, at, mekele, ras, makonnen, laid, siege, to, the, fort, and, on, the, morning, of, 7, january, 1896, the, defenders, of, the, fort, spotted, a, huge, red, tent, among, the, besiegers, showing, that, the, emperor, had, arrived, on, 8, january, 1896, the, emperor, s, elite, shoan, infantry, captured, the, fort, s, well, and, then, beat, off, desperate, italian, attempts, to, retake, the, well, on, 19, january, 1896, the, fort, s, commander, major, galliano, whose, men, were, dying, of, dehydration, raised, the, white, flag, of, surrender, major, galliano, and, his, men, were, allowed, to, march, out, surrender, their, arms, and, go, free, menelik, stated, he, allowed, the, italians, to, go, free, to, give, proof, of, my, christian, faith, saying, his, quarrel, was, with, the, italian, government, of, prime, minister, francesco, crispi, that, was, trying, to, conquer, his, nation, not, the, ordinary, italian, soldiers, who, been, conscripted, against, their, will, to, fight, in, the, war, menelik, s, magnanimity, to, the, defenders, of, fort, mekele, may, have, been, an, act, of, psychological, warfare, menelik, knew, from, talking, to, french, and, russian, diplomats, that, the, war, and, crispi, himself, were, unpopular, in, italy, and, one, of, the, main, points, of, crispi, s, propaganda, was, allegations, of, atrocities, against, italian, pows, from, menelik, s, viewpoint, allowing, the, italian, pows, to, go, free, and, unharmed, was, the, best, way, of, rebutting, this, propaganda, and, undermining, public, support, for, crispi, crispi, sent, another, 15, 000, men, to, the, horn, of, africa, and, ordered, the, main, italian, commander, general, oreste, baratieri, to, finish, off, the, barbarians, as, baratieri, dithered, menelik, was, forced, to, pull, back, on, 17, february, 1896, as, his, huge, host, was, running, out, of, food, after, crispi, sent, an, insulting, telegram, accusing, baratieri, of, cowardice, on, 28, february, 1896, the, italians, decided, to, seek, battle, with, menelik, on, 1, march, 1896, the, two, armies, met, at, adwa, the, ethiopians, came, out, victorious, with, victory, at, the, battle, of, adwa, and, the, italian, colonial, army, destroyed, eritrea, was, emperor, menelik, s, for, the, taking, but, no, order, to, occupy, was, given, it, seems, that, emperor, menelik, ii, was, wiser, than, the, europeans, had, given, him, credit, for, realising, that, the, italians, would, bring, all, their, force, to, bear, on, his, country, if, he, attacked, he, instead, sought, to, restore, the, peace, that, had, been, broken, by, the, italians, and, their, treaty, manipulation, seven, years, before, in, signing, the, treaty, menelik, ii, again, proved, his, adeptness, at, politics, as, he, promised, each, nation, something, for, what, they, gave, and, made, sure, each, would, benefit, his, country, and, not, another, nation, subsequently, the, treaty, of, addis, ababa, was, reached, between, the, two, nations, italy, was, forced, to, recognise, the, absolute, independence, of, ethiopia, as, described, in, article, iii, of, the, treaty, following, menelik, s, victory, at, the, first, italo, ethiopian, war, the, european, powers, moved, rapidly, to, adjust, relations, with, the, ethiopian, empire, delegations, from, the, united, kingdom, and, france, whose, colonial, possessions, lay, next, to, ethiopia, soon, arrived, in, the, ethiopian, capital, to, negotiate, their, own, treaties, with, this, newly, proven, power, quickly, taking, advantage, of, the, italian, defeat, french, influence, increased, markedly, and, france, became, one, of, the, most, influential, european, powers, in, menelik, s, court, in, december, 1896, a, french, diplomatic, mission, in, addis, ababa, arrived, and, on, 20, march, 1897, signed, a, treaty, that, was, described, as, v, ritable, trait, d, alliance, in, turn, the, increase, in, french, influence, in, ethiopia, led, to, fears, in, london, that, the, french, would, gain, control, of, the, blue, nile, and, would, be, able, to, lever, the, british, out, of, egypt, on, the, eve, of, the, battle, of, adwa, two, sudanese, envoys, from, the, mahdiyya, state, arrived, at, menelik, s, camp, in, adwa, to, discuss, concentrated, action, against, the, italians, in, july, 1896, an, ethiopian, envoy, was, present, at, abdallahi, ibn, muhammad, s, court, in, omdurman, the, british, fearing, that, menelik, would, support, the, mahdist, revolt, sent, a, diplomatic, mission, to, ethiopia, and, on, 14, may, 1897, signed, the, anglo, ethiopian, treaty, of, 1897, menelik, assured, the, british, that, he, would, not, support, the, mahdists, and, declared, them, as, the, enemy, of, his, country, in, exchange, for, cession, of, the, northeastern, part, of, the, haud, region, a, traditional, somali, grazing, area, to, ethiopia, in, december, 1897, ras, makonnen, led, an, expedition, against, the, mahdists, to, seize, the, gold, producing, region, of, benishangul, gumuz, by, the, mid, 1890s, menelik, was, actively, suppressing, the, slave, trade, ordering, the, destruction, of, several, slave, markets, throughout, the, region, and, punishing, slave, traders, with, amputation, both, tewodros, ii, and, yohannes, iv, had, outlawed, slave, trading, but, as, not, all, tribes, were, against, it, and, as, the, country, was, surrounded, on, every, side, by, slave, raiders, and, traders, it, was, not, possible, even, at, the, dawn, of, the, 20th, century, to, suppress, the, trade, entirely, according, to, apologists, while, menelik, actively, enforced, his, prohibition, it, was, beyond, his, power, to, change, the, minds, of, all, his, people, regarding, the, age, old, practice, menelik, ii, was, fascinated, by, modernity, and, like, tewodros, ii, before, him, he, had, a, keen, ambition, to, introduce, western, technological, and, administrative, advances, into, ethiopia, following, the, rush, by, the, major, powers, to, establish, diplomatic, relations, following, the, ethiopian, victory, at, adwa, more, and, more, westerners, began, to, travel, to, ethiopia, looking, for, trade, farming, hunting, and, mineral, exploration, concessions, menelik, ii, founded, the, first, modern, bank, in, ethiopia, the, bank, of, abyssinia, introduced, the, first, modern, postal, system, signed, the, agreement, and, initiated, work, that, established, the, addis, ababa, djibouti, railway, with, the, french, introduced, electricity, to, addis, ababa, as, well, as, the, telephone, telegraph, the, motor, car, and, modern, plumbing, he, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, introduce, coinage, to, replace, the, maria, theresa, thaler, in, 1894, menelik, granted, a, concession, for, the, building, of, a, railway, to, his, capital, from, the, french, port, of, djibouti, but, alarmed, by, a, claim, made, by, france, in, 1902, to, control, of, the, line, in, ethiopian, territory, he, ordered, a, stop, for, four, years, on, the, extension, of, the, railway, beyond, dire, dawa, in, 1906, when, france, the, united, kingdom, and, italy, agreed, on, the, subject, granting, control, to, a, joint, venture, corporation, menelik, officially, reaffirmed, his, full, sovereign, rights, over, the, whole, of, his, empire, according, to, one, persistent, tale, menelik, heard, about, the, modern, method, of, executing, criminals, using, electric, chairs, during, the, 1890s, and, ordered, 3, for, his, kingdom, when, the, chairs, arrived, menelik, learned, they, would, not, work, as, ethiopia, did, not, yet, have, an, electric, power, industry, rather, than, waste, his, investment, menelik, used, one, of, the, chairs, as, his, throne, sending, another, to, his, second, lique, mekwas, or, abate, ba, yalew, recent, research, however, has, cast, significant, doubt, on, this, story, and, suggested, it, was, invented, by, a, canadian, journalist, during, the, 1930s, menelik, reportedly, spoke, french, english, and, italian, fluently, he, read, many, books, and, was, educated, in, finance, getting, involved, in, various, investments, including, in, american, railroads, and, american, securities, and, french, and, belgian, mining, investments, the, british, journalist, augustus, b, wylde, wrote, after, meeting, menelik, i, had, found, him, a, man, of, great, kindness, a, remarkably, shrewd, and, clever, man, and, very, well, informed, on, most, things, except, on, england, and, her, resources, his, information, on, our, country, evidently, having, been, obtained, from, persons, entirely, unfriendly, to, us, and, who, did, not, want, englishmen, to, have, any, diplomatic, or, commercial, transactions, whatever, with, abyssinia, after, meeting, him, count, gleichen, wrote, menelik, s, manners, are, pleasant, and, dignified, he, is, courteous, and, kindly, and, at, the, same, time, simple, in, manner, giving, one, the, impression, of, a, man, who, wishes, to, get, at, the, root, of, a, matter, at, once, without, wasting, time, in, compliments, and, beating, about, the, bush, so, often, the, characteristics, of, oriental, potentates, he, also, aims, at, being, a, popular, sovereign, accessible, to, his, people, at, all, hours, and, ready, to, listen, to, their, complaints, in, this, he, appears, to, be, quite, successful, for, one, and, all, of, his, subjects, seem, to, bear, for, him, a, real, affection, menelik, married, three, times, but, he, did, not, have, a, single, legitimate, child, by, any, of, his, wives, however, he, is, reputed, to, have, fathered, several, children, by, women, who, were, not, his, wives, and, he, recognized, three, of, those, children, as, being, his, progeny, in, 1864, menelik, married, woizero, altash, tewodros, whom, he, divorced, in, 1865, the, marriage, produced, no, children, altash, tewodros, was, a, daughter, of, emperor, tewodros, ii, she, and, menelik, were, married, during, the, time, that, menelik, was, held, captive, by, tewodros, the, marriage, ended, when, menelik, escaped, captivity, abandoning, her, she, was, subsequently, remarried, to, dejazmatch, bariaw, paulos, of, adwa, in, 1865, the, same, year, as, divorcing, his, first, wife, menelik, married, the, much, older, noblewoman, woizero, bafena, wolde, michael, this, marriage, was, also, childless, and, they, were, married, for, seventeen, years, before, being, divorced, in, 1882, menelik, was, very, fond, of, his, wife, but, she, apparently, did, not, have, a, sincere, affection, for, him, woizero, befana, had, several, children, by, previous, marriages, and, was, more, interested, in, securing, their, welfare, than, in, the, welfare, of, her, present, husband, for, many, years, she, was, widely, suspected, of, being, secretly, in, touch, with, emperor, yohannes, iv, in, her, ambition, to, replace, her, husband, on, the, throne, of, shewa, with, one, of, her, sons, from, a, previous, marriage, finally, she, was, implicated, in, a, plot, to, overthrow, menelik, when, he, was, king, of, shewa, with, the, failure, of, her, plot, woizero, befana, was, separated, from, menelik, but, menelik, apparently, was, still, deeply, attached, to, her, an, attempt, at, reconciliation, failed, but, when, his, relatives, and, courtiers, suggested, new, young, wives, to, the, king, he, would, sadly, say, you, ask, me, to, look, at, these, women, with, the, same, eyes, that, once, gazed, upon, befana, paying, tribute, both, to, his, ex, wife, s, beauty, and, his, own, continuing, attachment, to, her, finally, menelik, divorced, his, treasonous, wife, in, 1882, and, in, 1883, he, married, taytu, betul, menelik, s, new, wife, had, been, married, four, times, previously, and, he, became, her, fifth, husband, they, were, married, in, a, full, communion, church, service, and, the, marriage, was, thus, fully, canonical, and, indissoluble, which, had, not, been, the, case, with, either, of, menelik, s, previous, wives, the, marriage, which, proved, childless, would, last, until, his, death, taytu, betul, would, become, empress, consort, upon, her, husband, s, succession, and, would, become, the, most, powerful, consort, of, an, ethiopian, monarch, since, empress, mentewab, she, enjoyed, considerable, influence, on, menelik, and, his, court, until, the, end, something, which, was, aided, by, her, own, family, background, empress, taytu, betul, was, a, noblewoman, of, imperial, blood, and, a, member, of, one, of, the, leading, families, of, the, regions, of, semien, yejju, in, modern, wollo, and, begemder, her, paternal, uncle, dejazmatch, wube, haile, maryam, of, semien, had, been, the, ruler, of, tigray, and, much, of, northern, ethiopia, she, and, her, uncle,

able, to, broaden, his, power, base, in, northern, ethiopia, through, taytu, s, family, connections, in, begemider, semien, and, yejju, she, also, served, him, as, his, close, adviser, and, went, to, the, battle, of, adwa, with, 5, 000, troops, of, her, own, from, 1906, for, all, intents, and, purposes, taytu, betul, ruled, in, menelik, s, stead, during, his, infirmity, menelik, ii, and, taytu, betul, personally, owned, 70, 000, slaves, abba, jifar, ii, also, is, said, to, have, more, than, 10, 000, slaves, and, allowed, his, armies, to, enslave, the, captives, during, a, battle, with, all, his, neighboring, clans, this, practice, was, common, between, various, tribes, and, clans, of, ethiopia, for, thousands, of, years, taytu, arranged, political, marriages, between, her, yejju, and, semien, relatives, and, key, shewan, aristocrates, like, ras, woldegyorgis, aboye, who, was, governor, of, kaffa, ras, mekonen, who, was, governor, of, harar, and, menelik, s, eldest, daughter, zewditu, menelik, who, became, nigeste, negestat, of, the, empire, after, the, overthrow, of, lij, iyasu, taytu, s, step, daughter, zewditu, was, married, to, her, nephew, ras, gugsa, welle, who, administered, begemider, up, to, the, 1930s, previous, to, his, marriage, to, taytu, betul, menelik, fathered, several, natural, children, among, them, he, chose, to, recognise, three, specific, children, two, daughters, and, one, son, as, being, his, progeny, these, were, menelik, s, only, recognised, son, abeto, asfa, wossen, menelik, died, unwed, and, childless, when, he, was, about, fifteen, years, of, age, leaving, him, with, only, two, daughters, the, elder, daughter, woizero, shoaregga, was, first, married, to, dejazmatch, wodajo, gobena, the, son, of, ras, gobena, dachi, they, had, a, son, abeto, wossen, seged, wodajo, but, this, grandson, of, menelik, ii, was, eliminated, from, the, succession, due, to, dwarfism, in, 1892, twenty, five, year, old, woizero, shoaregga, was, married, for, a, second, time, to, forty, two, year, old, ras, mikael, of, wollo, they, had, two, children, namely, a, daughter, woizero, zenebework, mikael, who, would, be, married, at, the, age, of, twelve, to, the, much, older, ras, bezabih, tekle, haymanot, of, gojjam, and, would, die, in, childbirth, a, year, later, and, a, son, lij, iyasu, who, would, nominally, succeed, as, emperor, after, menelik, s, death, in, 1913, but, would, never, be, crowned, and, would, be, deposed, by, powerful, nobles, in, favour, of, menelik, s, younger, daughter, zewditu, in, 1916, menelik, s, younger, daughter, zewditu, menelik, had, a, long, and, chequered, life, she, was, married, four, times, and, eventually, became, empress, in, her, own, right, the, first, woman, to, hold, that, position, in, ethiopia, since, the, queen, of, sheba, she, was, only, ten, years, old, when, menelik, got, her, married, to, ras, araya, selassie, yohannes, the, fifteen, year, old, son, of, emperor,

survived, to, adulthood, menelik, died, in, 1913, and, his, grandson, iyasu, claimed, the, throne, on, principle, of, seniority, however, it, was, suspected, that, iyasu, was, a, secret, convert, to, islam, which, was, the, religion, of, his, paternal, ancestors, and, having, a, muslim, on, the, throne, would, have, grave, implications, for, ethiopia, in, future, generations, therefore, iyasu, was, never, crowned, he, was, deposed, by, nobles, in, 1916, in, favour, of, his, aunt, zewditu, however, zewditu, aged, 40, at, that, time, had, no, surviving, children, all, her, children, had, died, young, and, the, nobles, did, not, want, her, husband, and, his, family, to, exercise, power, and, eventually, occupy, the, throne, therefore, zewditu, s, cousin, ras, tafari, makonnen, was, named, both, heir, to, the, throne, and, regent, of, the, empire, zewditu, had, ceremonial, duties, to, perform, and, wielded, powers, of, arbitration, and, moral, influence, but, ruling, power, was, vested, in, the, hands, of, regent, ras, tafari, makonnen, who, succeeded, her, as, emperor, haile, selassie, in, 1930, apart, from, the, three, recognised, natural, children, menelik, was, rumoured, to, be, the, father, of, some, other, children, also, these, include, ras, birru, wolde, gabriel, and, dejazmach, kebede, tessema, the, latter, in, turn, was, later, rumoured, to, be, the, natural, grandfather, of, colonel, mengistu, haile, mariam, the, communist, leader, of, the, derg, who, eventually, deposed, the, monarchy, and, assumed, power, in, ethiopia, from, 1977, to, 1991, on, 27, october, 1909, menelik, ii, suffered, a, massive, stroke, and, his, mind, and, spirit, died, after, that, menelik, was, no, longer, able, to, reign, and, the, office, was, taken, over, by, empress, taytu, as, de, facto, ruler, until, ras, bitwaddad, tesemma, was, publicly, appointed, regent, however, he, died, within, a, year, and, a, council, of, regency, from, which, the, empress, was, excluded, was, formed, in, march, 1910, in, the, early, morning, hours, of, 12, december, 1913, emperor, menelik, ii, died, he, was, buried, quickly, without, announcement, or, ceremony, at, the, se, el, bet, kidane, meheret, church, on, the, grounds, of, the, imperial, palace, in, 1916, menelik, ii, was, reburied, in, the, specially, built, church, at, ba, eta, le, mariam, monastery, in, addis, ababa, after, the, death, of, menelik, ii, the, council, of, regency, continued, to, rule, ethiopia, lij, iyasu, was, never, crowned, emperor, of, ethiopia, and, eventually, empress, zewditu, i, succeeded, menelik, ii, on, 27, september, 1916, the, adwa, victory, day, is, celebrated, in, march, annually, and, it, would, also, inspire, pan, african, movements, around, the, globe, despite, being, generally, considered, the, founder, of, modern, ethiopia, menelik, s, legacy, also, garnered, controversies, due, to, the, atrocities, committed, by, his, army, against, civilians, and, combatants, during, the, annexation, of, territories, into, his, empire, which, are, considered, by, many, historians, as, constituting, genocide, according, to, awol, allo, the, historical, figure, that, masterminded, the, victory, at, adwa, emperor, menelik, ii, also, presided, over, some, of, the, most, brutal, atrocities, committed, against, the, various, groups, in, the, southern, part, of, the, country, particularly, the, oromos, as, they, resisted, his, southward, expansion, for, oromos, menelik, ii, is, devil, incarnate, and, is, beyond, redemption, perhaps, the, association, of, adwa, with, menelik, ii, is, the, single, most, important, reason, behind, oromo, ambivalence, towards, this, historical, event, a, desire, to, share, in, the, glamor, menelik, enjoyed, after, his, victory, over, italy, may, explain, an, improbable, serb, legend, recounted, by, english, anthropologist, mary, e, durham, portraying, menelik, and, the, serb, king, of, montenegro, as, kinsmen, based, on, little, more, than, the, similarity, between, the, ethiopian, honorific, negus, and, the, name, of, the, herzegovinian, village, njegushi, from, which, the, montenegrin, royal, family, originated, when, these, herzegovinese, migrated, to, montenegro, a, large, body, of, them, went, yet, farther, afield, and, settled, in, the, mountains, of, abyssinia, among, them, a, branch, of, the, family, of, petrovich, of, njegushi, from, which, is, directly, descended, menelik, who, preserves, the, title, of, negus, and, is, a, distant, cousin, of, prince, nikola, of, montenegro, and, to, this, large, admixture, of, slav, blood, the, abyssinians, owe, their, fine, stature, and, their, high, standard, of, civilisation, as, compared, with, the, neighbouring, african, tribes, menelik, is, featured, as, the, leader, of, the, ethiopian, civilization, in, the, new, frontier, season, pass, of, the, 4x, video, game, civilization, vi
