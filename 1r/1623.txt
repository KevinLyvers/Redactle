henry, cavendish, frs, k, v, n, d, kav, n, dish, 10, october, 1731, 24, february, 1810, was, an, english, natural, philosopher, and, scientist, who, was, an, important, experimental, and, theoretical, chemist, and, physicist, he, is, noted, for, his, discovery, of, hydrogen, which, he, termed, inflammable, air, he, described, the, density, of, inflammable, air, which, formed, water, on, combustion, in, a, 1766, paper, on, factitious, airs, antoine, lavoisier, later, reproduced, cavendish, s, experiment, and, gave, the, element, its, name, a, shy, man, cavendish, was, distinguished, for, great, accuracy, and, precision, in, his, researches, into, the, composition, of, atmospheric, air, the, properties, of, different, gases, the, synthesis, of, water, the, law, governing, electrical, attraction, and, repulsion, a, mechanical, theory, of, heat, and, calculations, of, the, density, and, hence, the, mass, of, the, earth, his, experiment, to, measure, the, density, of, the, earth, which, in, turn, allows, the, gravitational, constant, to, be, calculated, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, cavendish, experiment, henry, cavendish, was, born, on, 10, october, 1731, in, nice, where, his, family, was, living, at, the, time, his, mother, was, lady, anne, de, grey, fourth, daughter, of, henry, grey, 1st, duke, of, kent, and, his, father, was, lord, charles, cavendish, the, third, son, of, william, cavendish, 2nd, duke, of, devonshire, the, family, traced, its, lineage, across, eight, centuries, to, norman, times, and, was, closely, connected, to, many, aristocratic, families, of, great, britain, henry, s, mother, died, in, 1733, three, months, after, the, birth, of, her, second, son, frederick, and, shortly, before, henry, s, second, birthday, leaving, lord, charles, cavendish, to, bring, up, his, two, sons, henry, cavendish, was, styled, as, the, honourable, henry, cavendish, from, the, age, of, 11, henry, attended, newcome, s, school, a, private, school, near, london, at, the, age, of, 18, on, 24, november, 1748, he, entered, the, university, of, cambridge, in, st, peter, s, college, now, known, as, peterhouse, but, left, three, years, later, on, 23, february, 1751, without, taking, a, degree, at, the, time, a, common, practice, he, then, lived, with, his, father, in, london, where, he, soon, had, his, own, laboratory, complete, with, dog, room, lord, charles, cavendish, spent, his, life, firstly, in, politics, and, then, increasingly, in, science, especially, in, the, royal, society, of, london, in, 1758, he, took, henry, to, meetings, of, the, royal, society, and, also, to, dinners, of, the, royal, society, club, in, 1760, henry, cavendish, was, elected, to, both, these, groups, and, he, was, assiduous, in, his, attendance, after, that, he, took, virtually, no, part, in, politics, but, followed, his, father, into, science, through, his, researches, and, his, participation, in, scientific, organisations, he, was, active, in, the, council, of, the, royal, society, of, london, to, which, he, was, elected, in, 1765, his, interest, and, expertise, in, the, use, of, scientific, instruments, led, him, to, head, a, committee, to, review, the, royal, society, s, meteorological, instruments, and, to, help, assess, the, instruments, of, the, royal, greenwich, observatory, his, first, paper, factitious, airs, appeared, in, 1766, other, committees, on, which, he, served, included, the, committee, of, papers, which, chose, the, papers, for, publication, in, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, and, the, committees, for, the, transit, of, venus, 1769, for, the, gravitational, attraction, of, mountains, 1774, and, for, the, scientific, instructions, for, constantine, phipps, s, expedition, 1773, in, search, of, the, north, pole, and, the, northwest, passage, in, 1773, henry, joined, his, father, as, an, elected, trustee, of, the, british, museum, to, which, he, devoted, a, good, deal, of, time, and, effort, soon, after, the, royal, institution, of, great, britain, was, established, cavendish, became, a, manager, 1800, and, took, an, active, interest, especially, in, the, laboratory, where, he, observed, and, helped, in, humphry, davy, s, chemical, experiments, about, the, time, of, his, father, s, death, cavendish, began, to, work, closely, with, charles, blagden, an, association, that, helped, blagden, enter, fully, into, london, s, scientific, society, in, return, blagden, helped, to, keep, the, world, at, a, distance, from, cavendish, cavendish, published, no, books, and, few, papers, but, he, achieved, much, several, areas, of, research, including, mechanics, optics, and, magnetism, feature, extensively, in, his, manuscripts, but, they, scarcely, feature, in, his, published, work, cavendish, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, so, called, pneumatic, chemists, of, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, along, with, for, example, joseph, priestley, joseph, black, and, daniel, rutherford, cavendish, found, that, a, definite, peculiar, and, highly, inflammable, gas, which, he, referred, to, as, inflammable, air, was, produced, by, the, action, of, certain, acids, on, certain, metals, this, gas, was, hydrogen, which, cavendish, correctly, guessed, was, proportioned, two, to, one, in, water, although, others, such, as, robert, boyle, had, prepared, hydrogen, gas, earlier, cavendish, is, usually, given, the, credit, for, recognising, its, elemental, nature, in, 1777, cavendish, discovered, that, air, exhaled, by, mammals, is, converted, to, fixed, air, carbon, dioxide, not, phlogisticated, air, as, predicted, by, joseph, priestley, also, by, dissolving, alkalis, in, acids, cavendish, produced, carbon, dioxide, which, he, collected, along, with, other, gases, in, bottles, inverted, over, water, or, mercury, he, then, measured, their, solubility, in, water, and, their, specific, gravity, and, noted, their, combustibility, he, concluded, in, his, 1778, paper, general, considerations, on, acids, that, respirable, air, constitutes, acidity, cavendish, was, awarded, the, royal, society, s, copley, medal, for, this, paper, gas, chemistry, was, of, increasing, importance, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, and, became, crucial, for, frenchman, antoine, laurent, lavoisier, s, reform, of, chemistry, generally, known, as, the, chemical, revolution, in, 1783, cavendish, published, a, paper, on, eudiometry, the, measurement, of, the, goodness, of, gases, for, breathing, he, described, a, new, eudiometer, of, his, invention, with, which, he, achieved, the, best, results, to, date, using, what, in, other, hands, had, been, the, inexact, method, of, measuring, gases, by, weighing, them, then, after, a, repetition, of, a, 1781, experiment, performed, by, priestley, cavendish, published, a, paper, on, the, production, of, pure, water, by, burning, hydrogen, in, dephlogisticated, air, air, in, the, process, of, combustion, now, known, to, be, oxygen, cavendish, concluded, that, rather, than, being, synthesised, the, burning, of, hydrogen, caused, water, to, be, condensed, from, the, air, some, physicists, interpreted, hydrogen, as, pure, phlogiston, cavendish, reported, his, findings, to, priestley, no, later, than, march, 1783, but, did, not, publish, them, until, the, following, year, the, scottish, inventor, james, watt, published, a, paper, on, the, composition, of, water, in, 1783, controversy, about, who, made, the, discovery, first, ensued, in, 1785, cavendish, investigated, the, composition, of, common, i, e, atmospheric, air, obtaining, impressively, accurate, results, he, conducted, experiments, in, which, hydrogen, and, ordinary, air, were, combined, in, known, ratios, and, then, exploded, with, a, spark, of, electricity, furthermore, he, also, described, an, experiment, in, which, he, was, able, to, remove, in, modern, terminology, both, the, oxygen, and, nitrogen, gases, from, a, sample, of, atmospheric, air, until, only, a, small, bubble, of, unreacted, gas, was, left, in, the, original, sample, using, his, observations, cavendish, observed, that, when, he, had, determined, the, amounts, of, phlogisticated, air, nitrogen, and, dephlogisticated, air, oxygen, there, remained, a, volume, of, gas, amounting, to, 1, 120, of, the, original, volume, of, nitrogen, by, careful, measurements, he, was, led, to, conclude, that, common, air, consists, of, one, part, of, dephlogisticated, air, mixed, with, four, of, phlogisticated, in, the, 1890s, around, 100, years, later, two, british, physicists, william, ramsay, and, lord, rayleigh, realised, that, their, newly, discovered, inert, gas, argon, was, responsible, for, cavendish, s, problematic, residue, he, had, not, made, an, error, what, he, had, done, was, perform, rigorous, quantitative, experiments, using, standardised, instruments, and, methods, aimed, at, reproducible, results, taken, the, mean, of, the, result, of, several, experiments, and, identified, and, allowed, for, sources, of, error, the, balance, that, he, used, made, by, a, craftsman, named, harrison, was, the, first, of, the, precision, balances, of, the, 18th, century, and, as, accurate, as, lavoisier, s, which, has, been, estimated, to, measure, one, part, in, 400, 000, cavendish, worked, with, his, instrument, makers, generally, improving, existing, instruments, rather, than, inventing, wholly, new, ones, cavendish, as, indicated, above, used, the, language, of, the, old, phlogiston, theory, in, chemistry, in, 1787, he, became, one, of, the, earliest, outside, france, to, convert, to, the, new, antiphlogistic, theory, of, lavoisier, though, he, remained, sceptical, about, the, nomenclature, of, the, new, theory, he, also, objected, to, lavoisier, s, identification, of, heat, as, having, a, material, or, elementary, basis, working, within, the, framework, of, newtonian, mechanism, cavendish, had, tackled, the, problem, of, the, nature, of, heat, in, the, 1760s, explaining, heat, as, the, result, of, the, motion, of, matter, in, 1783, he, published, a, paper, on, the, temperature, at, which, mercury, freezes, and, in, that, paper, made, use, of, the, idea, of, latent, heat, although, he, did, not, use, the, term, because, he, believed, that, it, implied, acceptance, of, a, material, theory, of, heat, he, made, his, objections, explicit, in, his, 1784, paper, on, air, he, went, on, to, develop, a, general, theory, of, heat, and, the, manuscript, of, that, theory, has, been, persuasively, dated, to, the, late, 1780s, his, theory, was, at, once, mathematical, and, mechanical, it, contained, the, principle, of, the, conservation, of, heat, later, understood, as, an, instance, of, conservation, of, energy, and, even, included, the, concept, although, not, the, label, of, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, following, his, father, s, death, henry, bought, another, house, in, town, and, also, a, house, in, clapham, common, built, by, thomas, cubitt, at, that, time, to, the, south, west, of, london, the, london, house, contained, the, bulk, of, his, library, while, he, kept, most, of, his, instruments, at, clapham, common, where, he, carried, out, most, of, his, experiments, the, most, famous, of, those, experiments, published, in, 1798, was, to, determine, the, density, of, the, earth, and, became, known, as, the, cavendish, experiment, the, apparatus, cavendish, used, for, weighing, the, earth, was, a, modification, of, the, torsion, balance, built, by, geologist, john, michell, who, died, before, he, could, begin, the, experiment, the, apparatus, was, sent, in, crates, to, cavendish, who, completed, the, experiment, in, 1797, 1798, and, published, the, results, the, experimental, apparatus, consisted, of, a, torsion, balance, with, a, pair, of, 2, inch, 1, 61, pound, lead, spheres, suspended, from, the, arm, of, a, torsion, balance, and, two, much, larger, stationary, lead, balls, 350, pounds, cavendish, intended, to, measure, the, force, of, gravitational, attraction, between, the, two, he, noticed, that, michell, s, apparatus, would, be, sensitive, to, temperature, differences, and, induced, air, currents, so, he, made, modifications, by, isolating, the, apparatus, in, a, separate, room, with, external, controls, and, telescopes, for, making, observations, using, this, equipment, cavendish, calculated, the, attraction, between, the, balls, from, the, period, of, oscillation, of, the, torsion, balance, and, then, he, used, this, value, to, calculate, the, density, of, the, earth, cavendish, found, that, the, earth, s, average, density, is, 5, 48, times, greater, than, that, of, water, john, henry, poynting, later, noted, that, the, data, should, have, led, to, a, value, of, 5, 448, and, indeed, that, is, the, average, value, of, the, twenty, nine, determinations, cavendish, included, in, his, paper, the, error, in, the, published, number, was, due, to, a, simple, arithmetical, mistake, on, his, part, what, was, extraordinary, about, cavendish, s, experiment, was, its, elimination, of, every, source, of, error, and, every, factor, that, could, disturb, the, experiment, and, its, precision, in, measuring, an, astonishingly, small, attraction, a, mere, 1, 50, 000, 000, of, the, weight, of, the, lead, balls, the, result, that, cavendish, obtained, for, the, density, of, the, earth, is, within, 1, per, cent, of, the, currently, accepted, figure, cavendish, s, work, led, others, to, accurate, values, for, the, gravitational, constant, g, and, earth, s, mass, based, on, his, results, one, can, calculate, a, value, for, g, of, 6, 754, 10, 11, n, m, 2, kg, 2, which, compares, favourably, with, the, modern, value, of, 6, 67428, 10, 11, n, m, 2, kg, 2, books, often, describe, cavendish, s, work, as, a, measurement, of, either, g, or, the, earth, s, mass, since, these, are, related, to, the, earth, s, density, by, a, trivial, web, of, algebraic, relations, none, of, these, sources, are, wrong, but, they, do, not, match, the, exact, word, choice, of, cavendish, and, this, mistake, has, been, pointed, out, by, several, authors, cavendish, s, stated, goal, was, to, measure, the, earth, s, density, the, first, time, that, the, constant, got, this, name, was, in, 1873, almost, 100, years, after, the, cavendish, experiment, cavendish, s, results, also, give, the, earth, s, mass, cavendish, s, electrical, and, chemical, experiments, like, those, on, heat, had, begun, while, he, lived, with, his, father, in, a, laboratory, in, their, london, house, lord, charles, cavendish, died, in, 1783, leaving, almost, all, of, his, very, substantial, estate, to, henry, like, his, theory, of, heat, cavendish, s, comprehensive, theory, of, electricity, was, mathematical, in, form, and, was, based, on, precise, quantitative, experiments, working, with, his, colleague, timothy, lane, he, created, an, artificial, torpedo, fish, that, could, dispense, electric, shocks, to, show, that, the, source, of, shock, from, these, fish, was, electricity, he, published, an, early, version, of, his, theory, of, electricity, in, 1771, based, on, an, expansive, electrical, fluid, that, exerted, pressure, he, demonstrated, that, if, the, intensity, of, electric, force, were, inversely, proportional, to, distance, then, the, electric, fluid, more, than, that, needed, for, electrical, neutrality, would, lie, on, the, outer, surface, of, an, electrified, sphere, then, he, confirmed, this, experimentally, cavendish, continued, to, work, on, electricity, after, this, initial, paper, but, he, published, no, more, on, the, subject, cavendish, wrote, papers, on, electrical, topics, for, the, royal, society, but, the, bulk, of, his, electrical, experiments, did, not, become, known, until, they, were, collected, and, published, by, james, clerk, maxwell, a, century, later, in, 1879, long, after, other, scientists, had, been, credited, with, the, same, results, cavendish, s, electrical, papers, from, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, of, london, have, been, reprinted, together, with, most, of, his, electrical, manuscripts, in, the, scientific, papers, of, the, honourable, henry, cavendish, f, r, s, 1921, according, to, the, 1911, edition, of, encyclop, dia, britannica, among, cavendish, s, discoveries, were, the, concept, of, electric, potential, which, he, called, the, degree, of, electrification, an, early, unit, of, capacitance, that, of, a, sphere, one, inch, in, diameter, the, formula, for, the, capacitance, of, a, plate, capacitor, the, concept, of, the, dielectric, constant, of, a, material, the, relationship, between, electric, potential, and, current, now, called, ohm, s, law, 1781, laws, for, the, division, of, current, in, parallel, circuits, now, attributed, to, charles, wheatstone, and, the, inverse, square, law, of, variation, of, electric, force, with, distance, now, called, coulomb, s, law, cavendish, died, at, clapham, on, 24, february, 1810, as, one, of, the, wealthiest, men, in, britain, and, was, buried, along, with, many, of, his, ancestors, in, the, church, that, is, now, derby, cathedral, the, road, he, used, to, live, on, in, derby, has, been, named, after, him, as, has, a, road, near, his, house, in, clapham, of, which, the, north, part, is, part, of, the, south, circular, road, the, university, of, cambridge, s, cavendish, laboratory, was, endowed, by, one, of, cavendish, s, later, relatives, william, cavendish, 7th, duke, of, devonshire, chancellor, of, the, university, from, 1861, to, 1891, cavendish, inherited, two, fortunes, that, were, so, large, that, jean, baptiste, biot, called, him, the, richest, of, all, the, savants, and, the, most, knowledgeable, of, the, rich, at, his, death, cavendish, was, the, largest, depositor, in, the, bank, of, england, he, was, a, shy, man, who, was, uncomfortable, in, society, and, avoided, it, when, he, could, he, could, speak, to, only, one, person, at, a, time, and, only, if, the, person, were, known, to, him, and, male, he, conversed, little, always, dressed, in, an, old, fashioned, suit, and, developed, no, known, deep, personal, attachments, outside, his, family, cavendish, was, taciturn, and, solitary, and, regarded, by, many, as, eccentric, he, communicated, with, his, female, servants, only, by, notes, by, one, account, cavendish, had, a, back, staircase, added, to, his, house, to, avoid, encountering, his, housekeeper, because, he, was, especially, shy, of, women, the, contemporary, accounts, of, his, personality, have, led, some, modern, commentators, such, as, oliver, sacks, to, speculate, that, he, was, autistic, his, only, social, outlet, was, the, royal, society, club, whose, members, dined, together, before, weekly, meetings, cavendish, seldom, missed, these, meetings, and, was, profoundly, respected, by, his, contemporaries, however, his, shyness, made, conversation, difficult, guests, were, advised, to, wander, close, to, him, and, then, speak, as, if, into, vacancy, if, their, remarks, were, scientifically, worthy, they, might, receive, a, mumbled, reply, cavendish, was, more, likely, not, to, reply, at, all, cavendish, s, religious, views, were, also, considered, eccentric, for, his, time, he, was, considered, to, be, agnostic, as, his, biographer, george, wilson, comments, as, to, cavendish, s, religion, he, was, nothing, at, all, the, arrangement, of, his, residence, reserved, only, a, fraction, of, space, for, personal, comfort, as, his, library, was, detached, the, upper, rooms, and, lawn, were, for, astronomical, observation, and, his, drawing, room, was, a, laboratory, with, a, forge, in, an, adjoining, room, he, also, enjoyed, collecting, fine, furniture, exemplified, by, his, purchase, of, a, set, of, ten, inlaid, satinwood, chairs, with, matching, cabriole, legged, sofa, because, of, his, asocial, and, secretive, behaviour, cavendish, often, avoided, publishing, his, work, and, much, of, his, findings, were, not, told, even, to, his, fellow, scientists, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, long, after, his, death, james, clerk, maxwell, looked, through, cavendish, s, papers, and, found, observations, and, results, for, which, others, had, been, given, credit, examples, of, what, was, included, in, cavendish, s, discoveries, or, anticipations, were, richter, s, law, of, reciprocal, proportions, ohm, s, law, dalton, s, law, of, partial, pressures, principles, of, electrical, conductivity, including, coulomb, s, law, and, charles, s, law, of, gases, a, manuscript, heat, tentatively, dated, between, 1783, and, 1790, describes, a, mechanical, theory, of, heat, hitherto, unknown, the, manuscript, was, analysed, in, the, early, 21st, century, historian, of, science, russell, mccormmach, proposed, that, heat, is, the, only, 18th, century, work, prefiguring, thermodynamics, theoretical, physicist, dietrich, belitz, concluded, that, in, this, work, cavendish, got, the, nature, of, heat, essentially, right, as, cavendish, performed, his, famous, density, of, the, earth, experiment, in, an, outbuilding, in, the, garden, of, his, clapham, common, estate, his, neighbours, would, point, out, the, building, and, tell, their, children, that, it, was, where, the, world, was, weighed, in, honour, of, henry, cavendish, s, achievements, and, due, to, an, endowment, granted, by, henry, s, relative, william, cavendish, 7th, duke, of, devonshire, the, university, of, cambridge, s, physics, laboratory, was, named, the, cavendish, laboratory, by, maxwell, the, first, cavendish, professor, of, physics, and, an, admirer, of, cavendish, s, work
