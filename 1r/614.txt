lyc, e, lakanal, in, sceaux, hauts, de, seine, close, to, paris, and, turned, to, painting, after, graduating, three, formative, influences, in, his, early, life, seem, to, have, made, a, mark, on, his, films, catholicism, art, and, his, experiences, as, a, prisoner, of, war, robert, bresson, lived, in, paris, france, in, the, le, saint, louis, initially, also, a, photographer, bresson, made, his, first, short, film, les, affaires, publiques, public, affairs, in, 1934, bresson, enlisted, in, the, french, army, on, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, where, he, was, captured, by, the, germans, in, 1940, and, held, as, a, prisoner, of, war, for, more, than, a, year, an, experience, which, informed, un, condamn, mort, s, est, chapp, ou, le, vent, souffle, o, il, veut, a, man, escaped, in, a, career, that, spanned, fifty, years, bresson, made, only, 13, feature, length, films, this, reflects, his, painstaking, approach, to, the, filmmaking, process, and, his, non, commercial, preoccupations, difficulty, finding, funding, for, his, projects, was, also, a, factor, although, many, writers, claim, that, bresson, described, himself, as, a, christian, atheist, no, source, ever, confirmed, this, assertion, neither, are, the, circumstances, clear, under, which, bresson, would, have, said, it, on, the, contrary, in, an, interview, in, 1973, he, said, there, is, the, feeling, that, god, is, everywhere, and, the, more, i, live, the, more, i, see, that, in, nature, in, the, country, when, i, see, a, tree, i, see, that, god, exists, i, try, to, catch, and, to, convey, the, idea, that, we, have, a, soul, and, that, the, soul, is, in, contact, with, god, that, s, the, first, thing, i, want, to, get, in, my, films, furthermore, in, a, 1983, interview, for, tsr, s, sp, cial, cin, ma, bresson, declared, that, he, had, been, interested, in, making, a, film, based, on, the, book, of, genesis, although, he, believed, such, a, production, would, be, too, costly, and, time, consuming, bresson, was, sometimes, accused, of, an, ivory, tower, existence, critic, jonathan, rosenbaum, an, admirer, of, bresson, s, work, argued, that, the, filmmaker, was, a, mysterious, aloof, figure, and, wrote, that, on, the, set, of, four, nights, of, a, dreamer, 1971, the, director, seemed, more, isolated, from, his, crew, than, any, other, filmmaker, i, ve, seen, at, work, his, widow, and, onetime, assistant, director, mylene, van, der, mersch, often, conveyed, his, instructions, bresson, died, on, 18, december, 1999, at, his, home, in, droue, sur, drouette, southwest, of, paris, he, was, 98, he, made, his, last, film, l, argent, in, 1983, and, had, been, unwell, for, some, time, bresson, s, early, artistic, focus, was, to, separate, the, language, of, cinema, from, that, of, the, theater, which, often, relies, heavily, upon, the, actor, s, performance, to, drive, the, work, film, scholar, tony, pipolo, writes, that, bresson, opposed, not, just, professional, actors, but, acting, itself, preferring, to, think, of, his, actors, as, models, in, notes, on, the, cinematographer, original, french, title, notes, sur, le, cin, matographe, also, published, in, english, as, notes, on, the, cinematograph, a, collection, of, aphorisms, written, by, bresson, the, director, succinctly, defines, the, difference, between, the, two, human, models, movement, from, the, exterior, to, the, interior, actors, movement, from, the, interior, to, the, exterior, bresson, further, elaborates, on, his, disdain, for, acting, by, appropriating, a, remark, chateaubriand, had, made, about, 19th, century, poets, and, applying, it, to, actors, what, they, lack, is, not, naturalness, but, nature, for, bresson, to, think, it, s, more, natural, for, a, movement, to, be, made, or, a, phrase, to, be, said, like, this, than, like, that, is, absurd, and, nothing, rings, more, false, in, film, than, the, overstudied, sentiments, of, theater, with, his, model, technique, bresson, s, actors, were, required, to, repeat, multiple, takes, of, each, scene, until, all, semblances, of, performance, were, stripped, away, leaving, a, stark, effect, that, registers, as, both, subtle, and, raw, this, as, well, as, bresson, s, restraint, in, musical, scoring, would, have, a, significant, influence, on, minimalist, cinema, in, the, academic, journal, crosscurrents, shmuel, ben, gad, wrote, there, is, a, credibility, in, bresson, s, models, they, are, like, people, we, meet, in, life, more, or, less, opaque, creatures, who, speak, move, and, gesture, acting, on, the, other, hand, no, matter, how, naturalistic, actively, deforms, or, invents, by, putting, an, overlay, or, filter, over, the, person, presenting, a, simplification, of, a, human, being, and, not, allowing, the, camera, to, capture, the, actor, s, human, depths, thus, what, bresson, sees, as, the, essence, of, filmic, art, the, achievement, of, the, creative, transformation, involved, in, all, art, through, the, interplay, of, images, of, real, things, is, destroyed, by, the, artifice, of, acting, for, bresson, then, acting, is, like, mood, music, and, expressive, camera, work, just, one, more, way, of, deforming, reality, or, inventing, that, has, to, be, avoided, film, critic, roger, ebert, wrote, that, bresson, s, directorial, style, resulted, in, films, of, great, passion, because, the, actors, didn, t, act, out, the, emotions, the, audience, could, internalize, them, some, feel, that, bresson, s, catholic, upbringing, and, belief, system, lie, behind, the, thematic, structures, of, most, of, his, films, recurring, themes, under, this, interpretation, include, salvation, redemption, defining, and, revealing, the, human, soul, and, metaphysical, transcendence, of, a, limiting, and, materialistic, world, an, example, is, a, man, escaped, 1956, where, a, seemingly, simple, plot, of, a, prisoner, of, war, s, escape, can, be, read, as, a, metaphor, for, the, mysterious, process, of, salvation, bresson, s, films, are, also, critiques, of, french, society, and, the, wider, world, with, each, revealing, the, director, s, sympathetic, if, unsentimental, view, of, society, s, victims, that, the, main, characters, of, bresson, s, most, contemporary, films, the, devil, probably, 1977, and, l, argent, 1983, reach, similarly, unsettling, conclusions, about, life, indicates, the, director, s, feelings, towards, the, culpability, of, modern, society, in, the, dissolution, of, individuals, of, an, earlier, protagonist, he, said, mouchette, offers, evidence, of, misery, and, cruelty, she, is, found, everywhere, wars, concentration, camps, tortures, assassinations, film, historian, mark, cousins, argues, that, if, bergman, and, fellini, filmed, life, as, if, it, was, a, theatre, and, a, circus, respectively, bresson, s, microcosm, was, that, of, a, prison, describing, bresson, s, characters, as, psychologically, imprisoned, bresson, published, notes, on, the, cinematographer, in, 1975, in, which, he, argues, for, a, unique, sense, of, the, term, cinematography, for, him, cinematography, is, the, higher, function, of, cinema, while, a, movie, is, in, essence, only, filmed, theatre, cinematography, is, an, attempt, to, create, a, new, language, of, moving, images, and, sounds, bresson, is, often, referred, to, as, a, patron, saint, of, cinema, not, only, for, the, strong, catholic, themes, found, throughout, his, oeuvre, but, also, for, his, notable, contributions, to, the, art, of, film, his, style, can, be, detected, through, his, use, of, sound, associating, selected, sounds, with, images, or, characters, paring, dramatic, form, to, its, essentials, by, the, spare, use, of, music, and, through, his, infamous, actor, model, methods, of, directing, his, almost, exclusively, non, professional, actors, mark, cousins, writes, so, complete, was, bresson, s, rejection, of, cinema, norms, that, he, has, a, tendency, to, fall, outside, film, history, however, his, uncompromising, stance, has, been, extremely, influential, in, some, quarters, bresson, s, book, notes, on, the, cinematographer, 1975, is, one, of, the, most, respected, books, on, film, theory, and, criticism, his, theories, about, film, greatly, influenced, other, filmmakers, particularly, the, french, new, wave, directors, opposing, the, established, pre, war, french, cinema, known, as, tradition, de, la, qualit, by, offering, his, own, personal, responses, to, the, question, what, is, cinema, and, by, formulating, his, ascetic, style, bresson, gained, a, high, reputation, with, the, founders, of, the, french, new, wave, he, is, often, listed, along, with, alexandre, astruc, and, andr, bazin, as, one, of, the, main, figures, who, influenced, them, new, wave, pioneers, praised, bresson, and, posited, him, as, a, prototype, for, or, precursor, to, the, movement, however, bresson, was, neither, as, overtly, experimental, nor, as, outwardly, political, as, the, new, wave, filmmakers, and, his, religious, views, catholicism, and, jansenism, were, not, attractive, to, most, of, the, filmmakers, associated, with, the, movement, in, his, development, of, auteur, theory, fran, ois, truffaut, lists, bresson, among, the, few, directors, to, whom, the, term, auteur, can, genuinely, be, applied, and, later, names, him, as, one, of, the, only, examples, of, directors, who, could, approach, even, the, so, called, unfilmable, scenes, using, the, film, narrative, at, its, disposal, jean, luc, godard, also, looked, upon, bresson, with, high, admiration, robert, bresson, is, french, cinema, as, dostoevsky, is, the, russian, novel, and, mozart, is, the, german, music, screenwriter, and, director, alain, cavalier, describes, bresson, s, role, as, pivotal, not, only, in, the, new, wave, movement, but, for, french, cinema, in, general, writing, in, french, cinema, you, have, a, father, and, a, mother, the, father, is, bresson, and, the, mother, is, renoir, with, bresson, representing, the, strictness, of, the, law, and, renoir, warmth, and, generosity, all, the, better, french, cinema, has, and, will, have, to, connect, to, bresson, in, some, way, bresson, has, also, influenced, a, number, of, other, filmmakers, including, andrei, tarkovsky, chantal, akerman, jean, eustache, abel, ferrara, philippe, garrel, hal, hartley, monte,
