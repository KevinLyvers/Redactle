ludwig, eduard, boltzmann, b, l, t, s, m, n, german, 20, february, 1844, 5, september, 1906, was, an, austrian, physicist, and, philosopher, his, greatest, achievements, were, the, development, of, statistical, mechanics, and, the, statistical, explanation, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, in, 1877, he, provided, the, current, definition, of, entropy, s, k, b, ln, displaystyle, s, k, rm, b, ln, omega, where, is, the, number, of, microstates, whose, energy, equals, the, system, s, energy, interpreted, as, a, measure, of, the, statistical, disorder, of, a, system, max, planck, named, the, constant, k, b, the, boltzmann, constant, statistical, mechanics, is, one, of, the, pillars, of, modern, physics, it, describes, how, macroscopic, observations, such, as, temperature, and, pressure, are, related, to, microscopic, parameters, that, fluctuate, around, an, average, it, connects, thermodynamic, quantities, such, as, heat, capacity, to, microscopic, behavior, whereas, in, classical, thermodynamics, the, only, available, option, would, be, to, measure, and, tabulate, such, quantities, for, various, materials, boltzmann, was, born, in, erdberg, a, suburb, of, vienna, into, a, catholic, family, his, father, ludwig, georg, boltzmann, was, a, revenue, official, his, grandfather, who, had, moved, to, vienna, from, berlin, was, a, clock, manufacturer, and, boltzmann, s, mother, katharina, pauernfeind, was, originally, from, salzburg, boltzmann, was, home, schooled, until, the, age, of, ten, and, then, attended, high, school, in, linz, upper, austria, when, boltzmann, was, 15, his, father, died, starting, in, 1863, boltzmann, studied, mathematics, and, physics, at, the, university, of, vienna, he, received, his, doctorate, in, 1866, and, his, venia, legendi, in, 1869, boltzmann, worked, closely, with, josef, stefan, director, of, the, institute, of, physics, it, was, stefan, who, introduced, boltzmann, to, maxwell, s, work, in, 1869, at, age, 25, thanks, to, a, letter, of, recommendation, written, by, josef, stefan, boltzmann, was, appointed, full, professor, of, mathematical, physics, at, the, university, of, graz, in, the, province, of, styria, in, 1869, he, spent, several, months, in, heidelberg, working, with, robert, bunsen, and, leo, k, nigsberger, and, in, 1871, with, gustav, kirchhoff, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, in, berlin, in, 1873, boltzmann, joined, the, university, of, vienna, as, professor, of, mathematics, and, there, he, stayed, until, 1876, in, 1872, long, before, women, were, admitted, to, austrian, universities, he, met, henriette, von, aigentler, an, aspiring, teacher, of, mathematics, and, physics, in, graz, she, was, refused, permission, to, audit, lectures, unofficially, boltzmann, supported, her, decision, to, appeal, which, was, successful, on, 17, july, 1876, ludwig, boltzmann, married, henriette, they, had, three, daughters, henriette, 1880, ida, 1884, and, else, 1891, and, a, son, arthur, ludwig, 1881, boltzmann, went, back, to, graz, to, take, up, the, chair, of, experimental, physics, among, his, students, in, graz, were, svante, arrhenius, and, walther, nernst, he, spent, 14, happy, years, in, graz, and, it, was, there, that, he, developed, his, statistical, concept, of, nature, boltzmann, was, appointed, to, the, chair, of, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, munich, in, bavaria, germany, in, 1890, in, 1894, boltzmann, succeeded, his, teacher, joseph, stefan, as, professor, of, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, vienna, boltzmann, spent, a, great, deal, of, effort, in, his, final, years, defending, his, theories, he, did, not, get, along, with, some, of, his, colleagues, in, vienna, particularly, ernst, mach, who, became, a, professor, of, philosophy, and, history, of, sciences, in, 1895, that, same, year, georg, helm, and, wilhelm, ostwald, presented, their, position, on, energetics, at, a, meeting, in, l, beck, they, saw, energy, and, not, matter, as, the, chief, component, of, the, universe, boltzmann, s, position, carried, the, day, among, other, physicists, who, supported, his, atomic, theories, in, the, debate, in, 1900, boltzmann, went, to, the, university, of, leipzig, on, the, invitation, of, wilhelm, ostwald, ostwald, offered, boltzmann, the, professorial, chair, in, physics, which, became, vacant, when, gustav, heinrich, wiedemann, died, after, mach, retired, due, to, bad, health, boltzmann, returned, to, vienna, in, 1902, in, 1903, boltzmann, together, with, gustav, von, escherich, and, emil, m, ller, founded, the, austrian, mathematical, society, his, students, included, karl, p, ibram, paul, ehrenfest, and, lise, meitner, in, vienna, boltzmann, taught, physics, and, also, lectured, on, philosophy, boltzmann, s, lectures, on, natural, philosophy, were, very, popular, and, received, considerable, attention, his, first, lecture, was, an, enormous, success, even, though, the, largest, lecture, hall, had, been, chosen, for, it, the, people, stood, all, the, way, down, the, staircase, because, of, the, great, successes, of, boltzmann, s, philosophical, lectures, the, emperor, invited, him, for, a, reception, at, the, palace, in, 1905, he, gave, an, invited, course, of, lectures, in, the, summer, session, at, the, university, of, california, in, berkeley, which, he, described, in, a, popular, essay, a, german, professor, s, trip, to, el, dorado, in, may, 1906, boltzmann, s, deteriorating, mental, condition, described, in, a, letter, by, the, dean, as, a, serious, form, of, neurasthenia, forced, him, to, resign, his, position, and, his, symptoms, indicate, he, experienced, what, would, today, be, diagnosed, as, bipolar, disorder, four, months, later, he, died, by, suicide, on, 5, september, 1906, by, hanging, himself, while, on, vacation, with, his, wife, and, daughter, in, duino, near, trieste, then, austria, he, is, buried, in, the, viennese, zentralfriedhof, his, tombstone, bears, the, inscription, of, boltzmann, s, entropy, formula, s, k, log, w, displaystyle, s, k, cdot, log, w, boltzmann, s, kinetic, theory, of, gases, seemed, to, presuppose, the, reality, of, atoms, and, molecules, but, almost, all, german, philosophers, and, many, scientists, like, ernst, mach, and, the, physical, chemist, wilhelm, ostwald, disbelieved, their, existence, boltzmann, was, exposed, to, molecular, theory, by, the, paper, of, atomist, james, clerk, maxwell, entitled, illustrations, of, the, dynamical, theory, of, gases, which, described, temperature, as, dependent, on, the, speed, of, the, molecules, thereby, introducing, statistics, into, physics, this, inspired, boltzmann, to, embrace, atomism, and, extend, the, theory, boltzmann, wrote, treatises, on, philosophy, such, as, on, the, question, of, the, objective, existence, of, processes, in, inanimate, nature, 1897, he, was, a, realist, in, his, work, on, thesis, of, schopenhauer, s, boltzmann, refers, to, his, philosophy, as, materialism, and, says, further, idealism, asserts, that, only, the, ego, exists, the, various, ideas, and, seeks, to, explain, matter, from, them, materialism, starts, from, the, existence, of, matter, and, seeks, to, explain, sensations, from, it, boltzmann, s, most, important, scientific, contributions, were, in, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, based, upon, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, this, was, important, because, newtonian, mechanics, did, not, differentiate, between, past, and, future, motion, but, rudolf, clausius, invention, of, entropy, to, describe, the, second, law, was, based, on, disgregation, or, dispersion, at, the, molecular, level, so, that, the, future, was, one, directional, boltzmann, was, twenty, five, years, of, age, when, he, came, upon, james, clerk, maxwell, s, work, on, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, which, hypothesized, that, temperature, was, caused, by, collision, of, molecules, maxwell, used, statistics, to, create, a, curve, of, molecular, kinetic, energy, distribution, from, which, boltzmann, clarified, and, developed, the, ideas, of, kinetic, theory, and, entropy, based, upon, statistical, atomic, theory, creating, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, as, a, description, of, molecular, speeds, in, a, gas, it, was, boltzmann, who, derived, the, first, equation, to, model, the, dynamic, evolution, of, the, probability, distribution, maxwell, and, he, had, created, boltzmann, s, key, insight, was, that, dispersion, occurred, due, to, the, statistical, probability, of, increased, molecular, states, boltzmann, went, beyond, maxwell, by, applying, his, distribution, equation, to, not, solely, gases, but, also, liquids, and, solids, boltzmann, also, extended, his, theory, in, his, 1877, paper, beyond, carnot, rudolf, clausius, james, clerk, maxwell, and, lord, kelvin, by, demonstrating, that, entropy, is, contributed, to, by, heat, spatial, separation, and, radiation, maxwell, boltzmann, statistics, and, the, boltzmann, distribution, remain, central, in, the, foundations, of, classical, statistical, mechanics, they, are, also, applicable, to, other, phenomena, that, do, not, require, quantum, statistics, and, provide, insight, into, the, meaning, of, temperature, he, made, multiple, attempts, to, explain, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, with, the, attempts, ranging, over, many, areas, he, tried, helmholtz, s, monocycle, model, a, pure, ensemble, approach, like, gibbs, a, pure, mechanical, approach, like, ergodic, theory, the, combinatorial, argument, the, sto, zahlansatz, etc, most, chemists, since, the, discoveries, of, john, dalton, in, 1808, and, james, clerk, maxwell, in, scotland, and, josiah, willard, gibbs, in, the, united, states, shared, boltzmann, s, belief, in, atoms, and, molecules, but, much, of, the, physics, establishment, did, not, share, this, belief, until, decades, later, boltzmann, had, a, long, running, dispute, with, the, editor, of, the, preeminent, german, physics, journal, of, his, day, who, refused, to, let, boltzmann, refer, to, atoms, and, molecules, as, anything, other, than, convenient, theoretical, constructs, only, a, couple, of, years, after, boltzmann, s, death, perrin, s, studies, of, colloidal, suspensions, 1908, 1909, based, on, einstein, s, theoretical, studies, of, 1905, confirmed, the, values, of, the, avogadro, constant, and, the, boltzmann, constant, convincing, the, world, that, the, tiny, particles, really, exist, to, quote, planck, the, logarithmic, connection, between, entropy, and, probability, was, first, stated, by, l, boltzmann, in, his, kinetic, theory, of, gases, this, famous, formula, for, entropy, s, is, an, alternative, is, the, information, entropy, definition, introduced, in, 1948, by, claude, shannon, it, was, intended, for, use, in, communication, theory, but, is, applicable, in, all, areas, it, reduces, to, boltzmann, s, expression, when, all, the, probabilities, are, equal, but, can, of, course, be, used, when, they, are, not, its, virtue, is, that, it, yields, immediate, results, without, resorting, to, factorials, or, stirling, s, approximation, similar, formulas, are, found, however, as, far, back, as, the, work, of, boltzmann, and, explicitly, in, gibbs, see, reference, s, k, b, ln, w, displaystyle, s, k, mathrm, b, ln, w, where, k, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, and, ln, is, the, natural, logarithm, w, for, wahrscheinlichkeit, a, german, word, meaning, probability, is, the, probability, of, occurrence, of, a, macrostate, or, more, precisely, the, number, of, possible, microstates, corresponding, to, the, macroscopic, state, of, a, system, the, number, of, unobservable, ways, in, the, observable, thermodynamic, state, of, a, system, that, can, be, realized, by, assigning, different, positions, and, momenta, to, the, various, molecules, boltzmann, s, paradigm, was, an, ideal, gas, of, n, identical, particles, of, which, n, i, are, in, the, i, th, microscopic, condition, range, of, position, and, momentum, w, can, be, counted, using, the, formula, for, permutations, w, n, i, 1, n, i, displaystyle, w, n, prod, i, frac, 1, n, i, where, i, ranges, over, all, possible, molecular, conditions, and, where, displaystyle, denotes, factorial, the, correction, in, the, denominator, account, for, indistinguishable, particles, in, the, same, condition, boltzmann, could, also, be, considered, one, of, the, forerunners, of, quantum, mechanics, due, to, his, suggestion, in, 1877, that, the, energy, levels, of, a, physical, system, could, be, discrete, although, boltzmann, used, this, as, a, mathematical, device, with, no, physical, meaning, the, boltzmann, equation, was, developed, to, describe, the, dynamics, of, an, ideal, gas, f, t, v, f, x, f, m, f, v, f, t, c, o, l, l, i, s, i, o, n, displaystyle, frac, partial, f, partial, t, v, frac, partial, f, partial, x, frac, f, m, frac, partial, f, partial, v, frac, partial, f, partial, t, left, frac, right, mathrm, collision, where, represents, the, distribution, function, of, single, particle, position, and, momentum, at, a, given, time, see, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, f, is, a, force, m, is, the, mass, of, a, particle, t, is, the, time, and, v, is, an, average, velocity, of, particles, this, equation, describes, the, temporal, and, spatial, variation, of, the, probability, distribution, for, the, position, and, momentum, of, a, density, distribution, of, a, cloud, of, points, in, single, particle, phase, space, see, hamiltonian, mechanics, the, first, term, on, the, left, hand, side, represents, the, explicit, time, variation, of, the, distribution, function, while, the, second, term, gives, the, spatial, variation, and, the, third, term, describes, the, effect, of, any, force, acting, on, the, particles, the, right, hand, side, of, the, equation, represents, the, effect, of, collisions, in, principle, the, above, equation, completely, describes, the, dynamics, of, an, ensemble, of, gas, particles, given, appropriate, boundary, conditions, this, first, order, differential, equation, has, a, deceptively, simple, appearance, since, f, can, represent, an, arbitrary, single, particle, distribution, function, also, the, force, acting, on, the, particles, depends, directly, on, the, velocity, distribution, function, f, the, boltzmann, equation, is, notoriously, difficult, to, integrate, david, hilbert, spent, years, trying, to, solve, it, without, any, real, success, the, form, of, the, collision, term, assumed, by, boltzmann, was, approximate, however, for, an, ideal, gas, the, standard, chapman, enskog, solution, of, the, boltzmann, equation, is, highly, accurate, it, is, expected, to, lead, to, incorrect, results, for, an, ideal, gas, only, under, shock, wave, conditions, boltzmann, tried, for, many, years, to, prove, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, using, his, gas, dynamical, equation, his, famous, h, theorem, however, the, key, assumption, he, made, in, formulating, the, collision, term, was, molecular, chaos, an, assumption, which, breaks, time, reversal, symmetry, as, is, necessary, for, anything, which, could, imply, the, second, law, it, was, from, the, probabilistic, assumption, alone, that, boltzmann, s, apparent, success, emanated, so, his, long, dispute, with, loschmidt, and, others, over, loschmidt, s, paradox, ultimately, ended, in, his, failure, finally, in, the, 1970s, e, g, d, cohen, and, j, r, dorfman, proved, that, a, systematic, power, series, extension, of, the, boltzmann, equation, to, high, densities, is, mathematically, impossible, consequently, nonequilibrium, statistical, mechanics, for, dense, gases, and, liquids, focuses, on, the, green, kubo, relations, the, fluctuation, theorem, and, other, approaches, instead, the, idea, that, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, or, entropy, law, is, a, law, of, disorder, or, that, dynamically, ordered, states, are, infinitely, improbable, is, due, to, boltzmann, s, view, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, in, particular, it, was, boltzmann, s, attempt, to, reduce, it, to, a, stochastic, collision, function, or, law, of, probability, following, from, the, random, collisions, of, mechanical, particles, following, maxwell, boltzmann, modeled, gas, molecules, as, colliding, billiard, balls, in, a, box, noting, that, with, each, collision, nonequilibrium, velocity, distributions, groups, of, molecules, moving, at, the, same, speed, and, in, the, same, direction, would, become, increasingly, disordered, leading, to, a, final, state, of, macroscopic, uniformity, and, maximum, microscopic, disorder, or, the, state, of, maximum, entropy, where, the, macroscopic, uniformity, corresponds, to, the, obliteration, of, all, field, potentials, or, gradients, the, second, law, he, argued, was, thus, simply, the, result, of, the, fact, that, in, a, world, of, mechanically, colliding, particles, disordered, states, are, the, most, probable, because, there, are, so, many, more, possible, disordered, states, than, ordered, ones, a, system, will, almost, always, be, found, either, in, the, state, of, maximum, disorder, the, macrostate, with, the, greatest, number, of, accessible, microstates, such, as, a, gas, in, a, box, at, equilibrium, or, moving, towards, it, a, dynamically, ordered, state, one, with, molecules, moving, at, the, same, speed, and, in, the, same, direction, boltzmann, concluded, is, thus, the, most, improbable, case, conceivable, an, infinitely, improbable, configuration, of, energy, boltzmann, accomplished, the, feat, of, showing, that, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, is, only, a, statistical, fact, the, gradual, disordering, of, energy, is, analogous, to, the, disordering, of, an, initially, ordered, pack, of, cards, under, repeated, shuffling, and, just, as, the, cards, will, finally, return, to, their, original, order, if, shuffled, a, gigantic, number, of, times, so, the, entire, universe, must, some, day, regain, by, pure, chance, the, state, from, which, it, first, set, out, this, optimistic, coda, to, the, idea, of, the, dying, universe, becomes, somewhat, muted, when, one, attempts, to, estimate, the, timeline, which, will, probably, elapse, before, it, spontaneously, occurs, the, tendency, for, entropy, increase, seems, to, cause, difficulty, to, beginners, in, thermodynamics, but, is, easy, to, understand, from, the, standpoint, of, the, theory, of, probability, consider, two, ordinary, dice, with, both, sixes, face, up, after, the, dice, are, shaken, the, chance, of, finding, these, two, sixes, face, up, is, small, 1, in, 36, thus, one, can, say, that, the, random, motion, the, agitation, of, the, dice, like, the, chaotic, collisions, of, molecules, because, of, thermal, energy, causes, the, less, probable, state, to, change, to, one, that, is, more, probable, with, millions, of, dice, like, the, millions, of, atoms, involved, in, thermodynamic, calculations, the, probability, of, their, all, being, sixes, becomes, so, vanishingly, small, that, the, system, must, move, to, one, of, the, more, probable, states, ludwig, boltzmann, s, contributions, to, physics, and, philosophy, have, left, a, lasting, impact, on, modern, science, his, pioneering, work, in, statistical, mechanics, and, thermodynamics, laid, the, foundation, for, some, of, the, most, fundamental, concepts, in, physics, for, instance, max, planck, in, quantizing, resonators, in, his, black, body, theory, of, radiation, used, the, boltzmann, constant, to, describe, the, entropy, of, the, system, to, arrive, at, his, formula, in, 1900, however, boltzmann, s, work, was, not, always, readily, accepted, during, his, lifetime, and, he, faced, opposition, from, some, of, his, contemporaries, particularly, in, regards, to, the, existence, of, atoms, and, molecules, nevertheless, the, validity, and, importance, of, his, ideas, were, eventually, recognized, and, they, have, since, become, cornerstones, of, modern, physics, here, we, delve, into, some, aspects, of, boltzmann, s, legacy, and, his, influence, on, various, areas, of, science, boltzmann, s, kinetic, theory, of, gases, was, one, of, the, first, attempts, to, explain, macroscopic, properties, such, as, pressure, and, temperature, in, terms, of, the, behaviour, of, individual, atoms, and, molecules, although, many, chemists, were, already, accepting, the, existence, of, atoms, and, molecules, the, broader, physics, community, took, some, time, to, embrace, this, view, boltzmann, s, long, running, dispute, with, the, editor, of, a, prominent, german, physics, journal, over, the, acceptance, of, atoms, and, molecules, underscores, the, initial, resistance, to, this, idea, it, was, only, after, experiments, such, as, jean, perrin, s, studies, of, colloidal, suspensions, confirmed, the, values, of, the, avogadro, constant, and, the, boltzmann, constant, that, the, existence, of, atoms, and, molecules, gained, wider, acceptance, boltzmann, s, kinetic, theory, played, a, crucial, role, in, demonstrating, the, reality, of, atoms, and, molecules, and, explaining, various, phenomena, in, gases, liquids, and, solids, statistical, mechanics, which, boltzmann, pioneered, connects, macroscopic, observations, with, microscopic, behaviors, his, statistical, explanation, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, was, a, significant, achievement, and, he, provided, the, current, definition, of, entropy, s, k, b, ln, displaystyle, s, k, rm, b, ln, omega, where, k, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, and, is, the, number, of, microstates, corresponding, to, a, given, macrostate, max, planck, later, named, the, constant, k, b, as, the, boltzmann, constant, in, honor, of, boltzmann, s, contributions, to, statistical, mechanics, the, boltzmann, constant, plays, a, central, role, in, relating, thermodynamic, quantities, to, microscopic, properties, and, it, is, now, a, fundamental, constant, in, physics, appearing, in, various, equations, across, many, scientific, disciplines, because, the, boltzmann, equation, is, practical, in, solving, problems, in, rarefied, or, dilute, gases, it, has, been, used, in, many, diverse, areas, of, technology, it, is, used, to, calculate, space, shuttle, re, entry, in, the, upper, atmosphere, it, is, the, basis, for, neutron, transport, theory, and, ion, transport, in, semiconductors, boltzmann, s, work, in, statistical, mechanics, laid, the, groundwork, for, understanding, the, statistical, behavior, of, particles, in, systems, with, a, large, number, of, degrees, of, freedom, in, his, 1877, paper, he, used, discrete, energy, levels, of, physical, systems, as, a, mathematical, device, and, went, on, to, show, that, the, same, could, apply, to, continuous, systems, which, might, be, seen, as, a, forerunner, to, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, one, biographer, of, boltzmann, says, that, boltzmann, s, approach, pav, the, way, for, planck, the, concept, of, quantization, of, energy, levels, became, a, fundamental, postulate, in, quantum, mechanics, leading, to, groundbreaking, theories, like, quantum, electrodynamics, and, quantum, field, theory, thus, boltzmann, s, early, insights, into, the, quantization, of, energy, levels, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, development, of, quantum, physics, in, 1885, he, became, a, member, of, the, imperial, austrian, academy, of, sciences, and, in, 1887, he, became, the, president, of, the, university, of, graz, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1888, and, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1899, numerous, things, are, named, in, his, honour
