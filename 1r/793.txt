greatest, roman, historians, by, modern, scholars, the, surviving, portions, of, his, two, major, works, the, annals, latin, annales, and, the, histories, latin, historiae, examine, the, reigns, of, the, emperors, tiberius, claudius, nero, and, those, who, reigned, in, the, year, of, the, four, emperors, 69, ad, these, two, works, span, the, history, of, the, roman, empire, from, the, death, of, augustus, 14, ad, to, the, death, of, domitian, 96, ad, although, there, are, substantial, lacunae, in, the, surviving, texts, tacitus, s, other, writings, discuss, oratory, in, dialogue, format, see, dialogus, de, oratoribus, germania, in, de, origine, et, situ, germanorum, and, the, life, of, his, father, in, law, agricola, the, general, responsible, for, much, of, the, roman, conquest, of, britain, mainly, focusing, on, his, campaign, in, britannia, de, vita, et, moribus, iulii, agricolae, tacitus, s, histories, offers, insights, into, roman, attitudes, towards, jews, descriptions, of, jewish, customs, and, context, for, the, first, jewish, roman, war, his, annals, are, of, interest, for, providing, an, early, account, of, the, persecution, of, christians, and, one, of, the, earliest, extra, biblical, references, to, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, details, about, the, personal, life, of, tacitus, are, scarce, what, little, is, known, comes, from, scattered, hints, throughout, his, work, the, letters, of, his, friend, and, admirer, pliny, the, younger, and, an, inscription, found, at, mylasa, in, caria, tacitus, was, born, in, 56, or, 57, to, an, equestrian, family, the, place, and, date, of, his, birth, as, well, as, his, praenomen, first, name, are, not, known, in, the, letters, of, sidonius, apollinaris, his, name, is, gaius, but, in, the, major, surviving, manuscript, of, his, work, his, name, is, given, as, publius, one, scholar, s, suggestion, of, the, name, sextus, has, been, largely, rejected, most, of, the, older, aristocratic, families, failed, to, survive, the, proscriptions, which, took, place, at, the, end, of, the, republic, and, tacitus, makes, it, clear, that, he, owed, his, rank, to, the, flavian, emperors, hist, 1, 1, the, claim, that, he, was, descended, from, a, freedman, is, derived, from, a, speech, in, his, writings, which, asserts, that, many, senators, and, knights, were, descended, from, freedmen, ann, 13, 27, but, this, is, generally, disputed, in, his, article, on, tacitus, in, pauly, wissowa, i, borzsak, had, conjectured, that, the, historian, was, related, to, thrasea, paetus, and, etruscan, family, of, caecinii, about, whom, he, spoke, very, highly, furthermore, some, later, caecinii, bore, cognomen, tacitus, which, also, could, indicate, some, sort, of, relationship, it, had, been, suggested, that, the, historian, s, mother, was, a, daughter, of, aulus, caecina, paetus, suffect, consul, of, 37, and, sister, of, arria, wife, of, thrasea, his, father, may, have, been, the, cornelius, tacitus, who, served, as, procurator, of, belgica, and, germania, pliny, the, elder, mentions, that, cornelius, had, a, son, who, aged, rapidly, nh, 7, 76, which, implies, an, early, death, there, is, no, mention, of, tacitus, s, suffering, such, a, condition, but, it, is, possible, that, this, refers, to, a, brother, if, cornelius, was, indeed, his, father, the, friendship, between, the, younger, pliny, and, tacitus, leads, some, scholars, to, conclude, that, they, were, both, the, offspring, of, wealthy, provincial, families, the, province, of, his, birth, remains, unknown, though, various, conjectures, suggest, gallia, belgica, gallia, narbonensis, or, northern, italy, his, marriage, to, the, daughter, of, narbonensian, senator, gnaeus, julius, agricola, implies, that, he, came, from, gallia, narbonensis, tacitus, s, dedication, to, lucius, fabius, justus, in, the, dialogus, may, indicate, a, connection, with, spain, and, his, friendship, with, pliny, suggests, origins, in, northern, italy, no, evidence, exists, however, that, pliny, s, friends, from, northern, italy, knew, tacitus, nor, do, pliny, s, letters, hint, that, the, two, men, had, a, common, background, pliny, book, 9, letter, 23, reports, that, when, asked, whether, he, was, italian, or, provincial, he, gave, an, unclear, answer, and, so, was, asked, whether, he, was, tacitus, or, pliny, since, pliny, was, from, italy, some, infer, that, tacitus, was, from, the, provinces, probably, gallia, narbonensis, his, ancestry, his, skill, in, oratory, and, his, sympathetic, depiction, of, barbarians, who, resisted, roman, rule, e, g, ann, 2, 9, have, led, some, to, suggest, that, he, was, a, celt, this, belief, stems, from, the, fact, that, the, celts, who, had, occupied, gaul, prior, to, the, roman, invasion, were, famous, for, their, skill, in, oratory, and, had, been, subjugated, by, rome, as, a, young, man, tacitus, studied, rhetoric, in, rome, to, prepare, for, a, career, in, law, and, politics, like, pliny, he, may, have, studied, under, quintilian, c, 35, ad, c, 100, in, 77, or, 78, he, married, julia, agricola, daughter, of, the, famous, general, agricola, little, is, known, of, their, domestic, life, save, that, tacitus, loved, hunting, and, the, outdoors, he, started, his, career, probably, the, latus, clavus, mark, of, the, senator, under, vespasian, r, 69, 79, but, entered, political, life, as, a, quaestor, in, 81, or, 82, under, titus, he, advanced, steadily, through, the, cursus, honorum, becoming, praetor, in, 88, and, a, quindecimvir, a, member, of, the, priestly, college, in, charge, of, the, sibylline, books, and, the, secular, games, he, gained, acclaim, as, a, lawyer, and, as, an, orator, his, skill, in, public, speaking, ironically, counterpoints, his, cognomen, tacitus, silent, he, served, in, the, provinces, from, c, 89, to, c, 93, either, in, command, of, a, legion, or, in, a, civilian, post, he, and, his, property, survived, domitian, s, reign, of, terror, 81, 96, but, the, experience, left, him, jaded, and, perhaps, ashamed, at, his, own, complicity, instilling, in, him, the, hatred, of, tyranny, evident, in, his, works, the, agricola, chs, 44, 45, is, illustrative, agricola, was, spared, those, later, years, during, which, domitian, leaving, now, no, interval, or, breathing, space, of, time, but, as, it, were, with, one, continuous, blow, drained, the, life, blood, of, the, commonwealth, it, was, not, long, before, our, hands, dragged, helvidius, to, prison, before, we, gazed, on, the, dying, looks, of, mauricus, and, rusticus, before, we, were, steeped, in, senecio, s, innocent, blood, even, nero, turned, his, eyes, away, and, did, not, gaze, upon, the, atrocities, which, he, ordered, with, domitian, it, was, the, chief, part, of, our, miseries, to, see, and, to, be, seen, to, know, that, our, sighs, were, being, recorded, from, his, seat, in, the, senate, he, became, suffect, consul, in, 97, during, the, reign, of, nerva, being, the, first, of, his, family, to, do, so, during, his, tenure, he, reached, the, height, of, his, fame, as, an, orator, when, he, delivered, the, funeral, oration, for, the, famous, veteran, soldier, lucius, verginius, rufus, in, the, following, year, he, wrote, and, published, the, agricola, and, germania, foreshadowing, the, literary, endeavors, that, would, occupy, him, until, his, death, afterward, he, absented, himself, from, public, life, but, returned, during, trajan, s, reign, 98, 117, in, 100, he, and, his, friend, pliny, the, younger, prosecuted, marius, priscus, proconsul, of, africa, for, corruption, priscus, was, found, guilty, and, sent, into, exile, pliny, wrote, a, few, days, later, that, tacitus, had, spoken, with, all, the, majesty, which, characterizes, his, usual, style, of, oratory, a, lengthy, absence, from, politics, and, law, followed, while, he, wrote, the, histories, and, the, annals, in, 112, to, 113, he, held, the, highest, civilian, governorship, that, of, the, roman, province, of, asia, in, western, anatolia, recorded, in, the, inscription, found, at, mylasa, mentioned, above, a, passage, in, the, annals, fixes, 116, as, the, terminus, post, quem, of, his, death, which, may, have, been, as, late, as, 125, or, even, 130, it, seems, that, he, survived, both, pliny, died, c, 113, and, trajan, died, 117, it, remains, unknown, whether, tacitus, had, any, children, the, augustan, history, reports, that, emperor, marcus, claudius, tacitus, r, 275, 276, claimed, him, for, an, ancestor, and, provided, for, the, preservation, of, his, works, but, this, story, may, be, fraudulent, like, much, of, the, augustan, history, five, works, ascribed, to, tacitus, have, survived, albeit, with, gaps, the, most, substantial, of, which, are, the, annals, and, the, histories, this, canon, with, approximate, dates, consists, of, the, annals, and, the, histories, published, separately, were, meant, to, form, a, single, edition, of, thirty, books, although, tacitus, wrote, the, histories, before, the, annals, the, events, in, the, annals, precede, the, histories, together, they, form, a, continuous, narrative, from, the, death, of, augustus, 14, to, the, death, of, domitian, 96, though, most, has, been, lost, what, remains, is, an, invaluable, record, of, the, era, the, first, half, of, the, annals, survived, in, a, single, manuscript, from, corvey, abbey, in, germany, and, the, second, half, in, a, single, manuscript, from, monte, cassino, in, italy, it, is, remarkable, that, they, survived, at, all, in, an, early, chapter, of, the, agricola, tacitus, asserts, that, he, wishes, to, speak, about, the, years, of, domitian, nerva, and, trajan, in, the, histories, the, scope, has, changed, tacitus, says, that, he, will, deal, with, the, age, of, nerva, and, trajan, at, a, later, time, instead, he, will, cover, the, period, from, the, civil, wars, of, the, year, of, the, four, emperors, and, end, with, the, despotism, of, the, flavians, only, the, first, four, books, and, twenty, six, chapters, of, the, fifth, book, survive, covering, the, year, 69, and, the, first, part, of, 70, the, work, is, believed, to, have, continued, up, to, the, death, of, domitian, on, september, 18, 96, the, fifth, book, contains, as, a, prelude, to, the, account, of, titus, s, suppression, of, the, first, jewish, roman, war, a, short, ethnographic, survey, of, the, ancient, jews, and, it, is, an, invaluable, record, of, roman, attitudes, towards, them, the, annals, tacitus, s, final, work, covers, the, period, from, the, death, of, augustus, in, ad, 14, he, wrote, at, least, sixteen, books, but, books, 7, 10, and, parts, of, books, 5, 6, 11, and, 16, are, missing, book, 6, ends, with, the, death, of, tiberius, and, books, 7, 12, presumably, covered, the, reigns, of, caligula, and, claudius, the, remaining, books, cover, the, reign, of, nero, perhaps, until, his, death, in, june, 68, or, until, the, end, of, that, year, to, connect, with, the, histories, the, second, half, of, book, 16, is, missing, ending, with, the, events, of, 66, it, is, not, known, whether, tacitus, completed, the, work, he, died, before, he, could, complete, his, planned, histories, of, nerva, and, trajan, and, no, record, survives, of, the, work, on, augustus, and, the, beginnings, of, the, roman, empire, with, which, he, had, planned, to, finish, his, work, the, annals, is, one, of, the, earliest, secular, historical, records, to, mention, jesus, of, nazareth, which, tacitus, does, in, connection, with, nero, s, persecution, of, the, christians, tacitus, wrote, three, works, with, a, more, limited, scope, agricola, a, biography, of, his, father, in, law, gnaeus, julius, agricola, the, germania, a, monograph, on, the, lands, and, tribes, of, barbarian, germania, and, the, dialogus, a, dialogue, on, the, art, of, rhetoric, the, germania, latin, title, de, origine, et, situ, germanorum, is, an, ethnographic, work, on, the, germanic, tribes, outside, the, roman, empire, the, germania, fits, within, a, classical, ethnographic, tradition, which, includes, authors, such, as, herodotus, and, julius, caesar, the, book, begins, chapters, 1, 27, with, a, description, of, the, lands, laws, and, customs, of, the, various, tribes, later, chapters, focus, on, descriptions, of, particular, tribes, beginning, with, those, who, lived, closest, to, the, roman, empire, and, ending, with, a, description, of, those, who, lived, on, the, shores, of, the, baltic, sea, such, as, the, fenni, tacitus, had, written, a, similar, albeit, shorter, piece, in, his, agricola, chapters, 10, 13, the, agricola, written, c, 98, recounts, the, life, of, gnaeus, julius, agricola, an, eminent, roman, general, and, tacitus, s, father, in, law, it, also, covers, briefly, the, geography, and, ethnography, of, ancient, britain, as, in, the, germania, tacitus, favorably, contrasts, the, liberty, of, the, native, britons, with, the, tyranny, and, corruption, of, the, empire, the, book, also, contains, eloquent, polemics, against, the, greed, of, rome, one, of, which, that, tacitus, claims, is, from, a, speech, by, calgacus, ends, by, asserting, auferre, trucidare, rapere, falsis, nominibus, imperium, atque, ubi, solitudinem, faciunt, pacem, appellant, to, ravage, to, slaughter, to, usurp, under, false, titles, they, call, empire, and, where, they, make, a, desert, they, call, it, peace, oxford, revised, translation, there, is, uncertainty, about, when, tacitus, wrote, dialogus, de, oratoribus, many, characteristics, set, it, apart, from, the, other, works, of, tacitus, so, that, its, authenticity, has, at, various, times, been, questioned, it, is, likely, to, be, early, work, indebted, to, the, author, s, rhetorical, training, since, its, style, imitates, that, of, the, foremost, roman, orator, cicero, it, lacks, for, example, the, incongruities, that, are, typical, of, his, mature, historical, works, the, dialogus, is, dedicated, to, fabius, iustus, a, consul, in, 102, ad, tacitus, s, writings, are, known, for, their, dense, prose, that, seldom, glosses, the, facts, in, contrast, to, the, style, of, some, of, his, contemporaries, such, as, plutarch, when, he, writes, about, a, near, defeat, of, the, roman, army, in, annals, i, 63, he, does, so, with, brevity, of, description, rather, than, embellishment, in, most, of, his, writings, he, keeps, to, a, chronological, narrative, order, only, seldom, outlining, the, bigger, picture, leaving, the, readers, to, construct, that, picture, for, themselves, nonetheless, where, he, does, use, broad, strokes, for, example, in, the, opening, paragraphs, of, the, annals, he, uses, a, few, condensed, phrases, which, take, the, reader, to, the, heart, of, the, story, tacitus, s, historical, style, owes, some, debt, to, sallust, his, historiography, offers, penetrating, often, pessimistic, insights, into, the, psychology, of, power, politics, blending, straightforward, descriptions, of, events, moral, lessons, and, tightly, focused, dramatic, accounts, tacitus, s, own, declaration, regarding, his, approach, to, history, annals, i, 1, is, well, known, inde, consilium, mihi, tradere, sine, ira, et, studio, quorum, causas, procul, habeo, my, purpose, is, to, relate, without, either, anger, or, zeal, motives, from, which, i, am, far, removed, there, has, been, much, scholarly, discussion, about, tacitus, s, neutrality, throughout, his, writing, he, is, preoccupied, with, the, balance, of, power, between, the, senate, and, the, emperors, and, the, increasing, corruption, of, the, governing, classes, of, rome, as, they, adjusted, to, the, ever, growing, wealth, and, power, of, the, empire, in, tacitus, s, view, senators, squandered, their, cultural, inheritance, that, of, free, speech, to, placate, their, rarely, benign, emperor, tacitus, noted, the, increasing, dependence, of, the, emperor, on, the, goodwill, of, his, armies, the, julio, claudians, eventually, gave, way, to, generals, who, followed, julius, caesar, and, sulla, and, pompey, in, recognizing, that, military, might, could, secure, them, the, political, power, in, rome, hist, 1, 4, welcome, as, the, death, of, nero, had, been, in, the, first, burst, of, joy, yet, it, had, not, only, roused, various, emotions, in, rome, among, the, senators, the, people, or, the, soldiery, of, the, capital, it, had, also, excited, all, the, legions, and, their, generals, for, now, had, been, divulged, that, secret, of, the, empire, that, emperors, could, be, made, elsewhere, than, at, rome, tacitus, s, political, career, was, largely, lived, out, under, the, emperor, domitian, his, experience, of, the, tyranny, corruption, and, decadence, of, that, era, 81, 96, may, explain, the, bitterness, and, irony, of, his, political, analysis, he, draws, our, attention, to, the, dangers, of, power, without, accountability, love, of, power, untempered, by, principle, and, the, apathy, and, corruption, engendered, by, the, concentration, of, wealth, generated, through, trade, and, conquest, by, the, empire, nonetheless, the, image, he, builds, of, tiberius, throughout, the, first, six, books, of, the, annals, is, neither, exclusively, bleak, nor, approving, most, scholars, view, the, image, of, tiberius, as, predominantly, positive, in, the, first, books, and, predominantly, negative, after, the, intrigues, of, sejanus, the, entrance, of, tiberius, in, the, first, chapters, of, the, first, book, is, dominated, by, the, hypocrisy, of, the, new, emperor, and, his, courtiers, in, the, later, books, some, respect, is, evident, for, the, cleverness, of, the, old, emperor, in, securing, his, position, in, general, tacitus, does, not, fear, to, praise, and, to, criticize, the, same, person, often, noting, what, he, takes, to, be, their, more, admirable, and, less, admirable, properties, one, of, tacitus, s, hallmarks, is, refraining, from, conclusively, taking, sides, for, or, against, persons, he, describes, which, has, led, some, to, interpret, his, works, as, both, supporting, and, rejecting, the, imperial, system, see, tacitean, studies, black, vs, red, tacitists, his, latin, style, is, highly, praised, his, style, although, it, has, a, grandeur, and, eloquence, thanks, to, tacitus, s, education, in, rhetoric, is, extremely, concise, even, epigrammatic, the, sentences, are, rarely, flowing, or, beautiful, but, their, point, is, always, clear, the, style, has, been, both, derided, as, harsh, unpleasant, and, thorny, and, praised, as, grave, concise, and, pithily, eloquent, a, passage, of, annals, 1, 1, where, tacitus, laments, the, state, of, the, historiography, regarding, the, last, four, emperors, of, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, illustrates, his, style, the, histories, of, tiberius, gaius, claudius, and, nero, while, they, were, in, power, were, falsified, through, terror, and, after, their, death, were, written, under, the, irritation, of, a, recent, hatred, or, in, a, word, for, word, translation, tiberi, g, que, et, claudi, ac, ner, nis, r, s, fl, rentibus, ips, s, ob, metum, falsae, postquam, occiderant, recentibus, di, s, compositae, sunt, tiberius, s, gaius, s, and, claudius, s, as, well, as, nero, s, acts, while, flourishing, themselves, out, of, fear, counterfeited, after, they, came, to, fall, resulting, from, new, found, hate, related, are, compared, to, the, ciceronian, period, where, sentences, were, usually, the, length, of, a, paragraph, and, artfully, constructed, with, nested, pairs, of, carefully, matched, sonorous, phrases, this, is, short, and, to, the, point, but, it, is, also, very, individual, note, the, three, different, ways, of, saying, and, in, the, first, line, que, et, ac, and, especially, the, matched, second, and, third, lines, they, are, parallel, in, sense, but, not, in, sound, the, pairs, of, words, ending, entibus, is, are, crossed, over, in, a, way, that, deliberately, breaks, the, ciceronian, conventions, which, one, would, however, need, to, be, acquainted, with, to, see, the, novelty, of, tacitus, s, style, some, readers, then, and, now, find, this, teasing, of, their, expectations, merely, irritating, others, find, the, deliberate, discord, playing, against, the, evident, parallelism, of, the, two, lines, stimulating, and, intriguing, his, historical, works, focus, on, the, motives, of, the, characters, often, with, penetrating, insight, though, it, is, questionable, how, much, of, his, insight, is, correct, and, how, much, is, convincing, only, because, of, his, rhetorical, skill, he, is, at, his, best, when, exposing, hypocrisy, and, dissimulation, for, example, he, follows, a, narrative, recounting, tiberius, s, refusal, of, the, title, pater, patriae, by, recalling, the, institution, of, a, law, forbidding, any, treasonous, speech, or, writings, and, the, frivolous, prosecutions, which, resulted, annals, 1, 72, elsewhere, annals, 4, 64, 66, he, compares, tiberius, s, public, distribution, of, fire, relief, to, his, failure, to, stop, the, perversions, and, abuses, of, justice, which, he, had, begun, although, this, kind, of, insight, has, earned, him, praise, he, has, also, been, criticized, for, ignoring, the, larger, context, tacitus, owes, most, both, in, language, and, in, method, to, sallust, and, ammianus, marcellinus, is, the, later, historian, whose, work, most, closely, approaches, him, in, style, tacitus, makes, use, of, the, official, sources, of, the, roman, state, the, acta, senatus, the, minutes, of, the, sessions, of, the, senate, and, the, acta, diurna, a, collection, of, the, acts, of, the, government, and, news, of, the, court, and, capital, he, also, read, collections, of, emperors, speeches, such, as, those, of, tiberius, and, claudius, he, is, generally, seen, as, a, scrupulous, historian, who, paid, careful, attention, to, his, sources, tacitus, cites, some, of, his, sources, directly, among, them, cluvius, rufus, fabius, rusticus, and, pliny, the, elder, who, had, written, bella, germaniae, and, a, historical, work, which, was, the, continuation, of, that, of, aufidius, bassus, tacitus, also, uses, collections, of, letters, epistolarium, he, also, took, information, from, exitus, illustrium, virorum, these, were, a, collection, of, books, by, those, who, were, antithetical, to, the, emperors, they, tell, of, sacrifices, by, martyrs, to, freedom, especially, the, men, who, committed, suicide, while, he, places, no, value, on, the, stoic, theory, of, suicide, and, views, suicides, as, ostentatious, and, politically, useless, tacitus, often, gives, prominence, to, speeches, made, by, those, about, to, commit, suicide, for, example, cremutius, cordus, speech, in, ann, iv, 34, 35, in, 1934, 36, a, teubner, edition, of, complete, works, by, tacitus, p, cornelii, taciti, libri, qui, supersunt, edited, by, erich, koestermann, was, published, koestermann, prepared, then, a, second, edition, published, in, 1960, 70, it, is, now, outdated, a, completely, new, teubner, edition, with, the, same, title, was, published, in, 1978, 83, the, most, part, of, it, annals, histories, and, dialogue, was, edited, by, heinz, heubner, with, germania, edited, by, alf, nnerfors, and, agricola, by, josef, delz, yet, another, teubner, edition, was, prepared, by, istv, n, borzs, k, and, kenneth, wellesley, in, 1986, 92, borzs, k, edited, books, i, vi, of, the, annals, and, wellesley, books, xi, xvi, and, the, histories, this, edition, remains, unfinished, as, the, last, volume, containing, the, three, minor, opuscles, was, never, issued, works, by, tacitus
