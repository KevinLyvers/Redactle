jacques, louis, david, french, 30, august, 1748, 29, december, 1825, was, a, french, painter, in, the, neoclassical, style, considered, to, be, the, preeminent, painter, of, the, era, in, the, 1780s, his, cerebral, brand, of, history, painting, marked, a, change, in, taste, away, from, rococo, frivolity, toward, classical, austerity, severity, and, heightened, feeling, which, harmonized, with, the, moral, climate, of, the, final, years, of, the, ancien, r, gime, david, later, became, an, active, supporter, of, the, french, revolution, and, friend, of, maximilien, robespierre, 1758, 1794, and, was, effectively, a, dictator, of, the, arts, under, the, french, republic, imprisoned, after, robespierre, s, fall, from, power, he, aligned, himself, with, yet, another, political, regime, upon, his, release, that, of, napoleon, the, first, consul, of, france, at, this, time, he, developed, his, empire, style, notable, for, its, use, of, warm, venetian, colours, after, napoleon, s, fall, from, imperial, power, and, the, bourbon, revival, david, exiled, himself, to, brussels, then, in, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, where, he, remained, until, his, death, david, had, many, pupils, making, him, the, strongest, influence, in, french, art, of, the, early, 19th, century, especially, academic, salon, painting, jacques, louis, david, was, born, into, a, prosperous, french, family, in, paris, on, 30, august, 1748, when, he, was, about, nine, his, father, was, killed, in, a, duel, and, his, mother, left, him, with, his, well, off, architect, uncles, they, saw, to, it, that, he, received, an, excellent, education, at, the, coll, ge, des, quatre, nations, university, of, paris, but, he, was, never, a, good, student, he, had, a, facial, tumor, that, impeded, his, speech, and, he, was, always, preoccupied, with, drawing, he, covered, his, notebooks, with, drawings, and, he, once, said, i, was, always, hiding, behind, the, instructor, s, chair, drawing, for, the, duration, of, the, class, soon, he, desired, to, be, a, painter, but, his, uncles, and, mother, wanted, him, to, be, an, architect, he, overcame, the, opposition, and, went, to, learn, from, fran, ois, boucher, 1703, 1770, the, leading, painter, of, the, time, who, was, also, a, distant, relative, boucher, was, a, rococo, painter, but, tastes, were, changing, and, the, fashion, for, rococo, was, giving, way, to, a, more, classical, style, boucher, decided, that, instead, of, taking, over, david, s, tutelage, he, would, send, david, to, his, friend, joseph, marie, vien, 1716, 1809, a, painter, who, embraced, the, classical, reaction, to, rococo, there, david, attended, the, royal, academy, based, in, what, is, now, the, louvre, each, year, the, academy, awarded, an, outstanding, student, the, prestigious, prix, de, rome, which, funded, a, 3, to, 5, year, stay, in, rome, since, artists, were, now, revisiting, classical, styles, the, trip, provided, its, winners, the, opportunity, to, study, the, remains, of, classical, antiquity, and, the, works, of, the, italian, renaissance, masters, at, first, hand, called, pensionnaire, they, were, housed, in, the, french, academy, s, rome, outpost, which, from, the, years, 1737, to, 1793, was, the, palazzo, mancini, in, the, via, del, corso, david, made, three, consecutive, attempts, to, win, the, annual, prize, with, minerva, fighting, mars, diana, and, apollo, killing, niobe, s, children, and, the, death, of, seneca, with, each, failure, allegedly, contributing, to, his, lifelong, grudge, against, the, institution, after, his, second, loss, in, 1772, david, went, on, a, hunger, strike, which, lasted, two, and, a, half, days, before, the, faculty, encouraged, him, to, continue, painting, confident, he, now, had, the, support, and, backing, needed, to, win, the, prize, he, resumed, his, studies, with, great, zeal, only, to, fail, to, win, the, prix, de, rome, again, the, following, year, finally, in, 1774, david, was, awarded, the, prix, de, rome, on, the, strength, of, his, painting, of, erasistratus, discovering, the, cause, of, antiochus, disease, a, subject, set, by, the, judges, in, october, 1775, he, made, the, journey, to, italy, with, his, mentor, joseph, marie, vien, who, had, just, been, appointed, director, of, the, french, academy, at, rome, while, in, italy, david, mostly, studied, the, works, of, 17th, century, masters, such, as, poussin, caravaggio, and, the, carracci, although, he, declared, the, antique, will, not, seduce, me, it, lacks, animation, it, does, not, move, david, filled, twelve, sketchbooks, with, drawings, that, he, and, his, studio, used, as, model, books, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, was, introduced, to, the, painter, raphael, mengs, 1728, 1779, who, opposed, the, rococo, tendency, to, sweeten, and, trivialize, ancient, subjects, advocating, instead, the, rigorous, study, of, classical, sources, and, close, adherence, to, ancient, models, mengs, principled, historicizing, approach, to, the, representation, of, classical, subjects, profoundly, influenced, david, s, pre, revolutionary, painting, such, as, the, vestal, virgin, probably, from, the, 1780s, mengs, also, introduced, david, to, the, theoretical, writings, on, ancient, sculpture, by, johann, joachim, winckelmann, 1717, 1768, the, german, scholar, held, to, be, the, founder, of, modern, art, history, as, part, of, the, prix, de, rome, david, toured, the, newly, excavated, ruins, of, pompeii, in, 1779, which, deepened, his, belief, that, the, persistence, of, classical, culture, was, an, index, of, its, eternal, conceptual, and, formal, power, during, the, trip, david, also, assiduously, studied, the, high, renaissance, painters, raphael, making, a, profound, and, lasting, impression, on, the, young, french, artist, although, david, s, fellow, students, at, the, academy, found, him, difficult, to, get, along, with, they, recognized, his, genius, david, s, stay, at, the, french, academy, in, rome, was, extended, by, a, year, in, july, 1780, he, returned, to, paris, there, he, found, people, ready, to, use, their, influence, for, him, and, he, was, made, an, official, member, of, the, royal, academy, he, sent, the, academy, two, paintings, and, both, were, included, in, the, salon, of, 1781, a, high, honor, he, was, praised, by, his, famous, contemporary, painters, but, the, administration, of, the, royal, academy, was, very, hostile, to, this, young, upstart, after, the, salon, the, king, granted, david, lodging, in, the, louvre, an, ancient, and, much, desired, privilege, of, great, artists, when, the, contractor, of, the, king, s, buildings, m, p, coul, was, arranging, with, david, he, asked, the, artist, to, marry, his, daughter, marguerite, charlotte, this, marriage, brought, him, money, and, eventually, four, children, david, had, about, 50, of, his, own, pupils, and, was, commissioned, by, the, government, to, paint, horace, defended, by, his, father, but, he, soon, decided, only, in, rome, can, i, paint, romans, his, father, in, law, provided, the, money, he, needed, for, the, trip, and, david, headed, for, rome, with, his, wife, charlotte, and, three, of, his, students, one, of, whom, jean, germain, drouais, 1763, 1788, was, the, prix, de, rome, winner, of, that, year, in, rome, david, painted, his, famous, oath, of, the, horatii, 1784, in, this, piece, the, artist, references, enlightenment, values, while, alluding, to, rousseau, s, social, contract, the, republican, ideal, of, the, general, became, the, central, focus, of, the, painting, with, all, three, sons, positioned, in, compliance, with, the, father, the, oath, between, the, characters, can, be, read, as, an, act, of, unification, of, men, to, the, binding, of, the, state, the, issue, of, gender, roles, also, becomes, apparent, in, this, piece, as, the, women, in, horatii, greatly, contrast, the, group, of, brothers, david, depicts, the, father, with, his, back, to, the, women, shutting, them, out, of, the, oath, they, also, appear, to, be, smaller, in, scale, and, physically, isolated, from, the, male, figures, the, masculine, virility, and, discipline, displayed, by, the, men, s, rigid, and, confident, stances, is, also, severely, contrasted, to, the, slouching, swooning, female, softness, created, in, the, other, half, of, the, composition, here, we, see, the, clear, division, of, male, female, attributes, that, confined, the, sexes, to, specific, roles, under, rousseau, s, popularized, doctrine, of, separate, spheres, these, revolutionary, ideals, are, also, apparent, in, the, distribution, of, eagles, while, oath, of, the, horatii, and, the, tennis, court, oath, stress, the, importance, of, masculine, self, sacrifice, for, one, s, country, and, patriotism, the, distribution, of, eagles, would, ask, for, self, sacrifice, for, one, s, emperor, napoleon, and, the, importance, of, battlefield, glory, in, 1787, david, did, not, become, the, director, of, the, french, academy, in, rome, which, was, a, position, he, wanted, dearly, the, count, in, charge, of, the, appointments, said, david, was, too, young, but, said, he, would, support, him, in, 6, to, 12, years, this, situation, would, be, one, of, many, that, would, cause, him, to, lash, out, at, the, academy, in, years, to, come, for, the, salon, of, 1787, david, exhibited, his, famous, death, of, socrates, condemned, to, death, socrates, strong, calm, and, at, peace, discusses, the, immortality, of, the, soul, surrounded, by, crito, his, grieving, friends, and, students, he, is, teaching, philosophizing, and, in, fact, thanking, the, god, of, health, asclepius, for, the, hemlock, brew, which, will, ensure, a, peaceful, death, the, wife, of, socrates, can, be, seen, grieving, alone, outside, the, chamber, dismissed, for, her, weakness, plato, is, depicted, as, an, old, man, seated, at, the, end, of, the, bed, critics, compared, the, socrates, with, michelangelo, s, sistine, ceiling, and, raphael, s, stanze, and, one, after, ten, visits, to, the, salon, described, it, as, in, every, sense, perfect, denis, diderot, said, it, looked, as, if, he, copied, it, from, some, ancient, bas, relief, the, painting, was, very, much, in, tune, with, the, political, climate, at, the, time, for, this, painting, david, was, not, honored, by, a, royal, works, of, encouragement, for, his, next, painting, david, created, the, lictors, bring, to, brutus, the, bodies, of, his, sons, the, work, had, tremendous, appeal, for, the, time, before, the, opening, of, the, salon, the, french, revolution, had, begun, the, national, assembly, had, been, established, and, the, bastille, had, fallen, the, royal, court, did, not, want, propaganda, agitating, the, people, so, all, paintings, had, to, be, checked, before, being, hung, david, s, portrait, of, lavoisier, who, was, a, chemist, and, physicist, as, well, as, an, active, member, of, the, jacobin, party, was, banned, by, the, authorities, for, such, reasons, when, the, newspapers, reported, that, the, government, had, not, allowed, the, showing, of, the, lictors, bring, to, brutus, the, bodies, of, his, sons, the, people, were, outraged, and, the, royals, were, forced, to, give, in, the, painting, was, hung, in, the, exhibition, protected, by, art, students, the, painting, depicts, lucius, junius, brutus, the, roman, leader, grieving, for, his, sons, brutus, s, sons, had, attempted, to, overthrow, the, government, and, restore, the, monarchy, so, the, father, ordered, their, death, to, maintain, the, republic, brutus, was, the, heroic, defender, of, the, republic, sacrificing, his, own, family, for, the, good, of, the, republic, on, the, right, the, mother, holds, her, two, daughters, and, the, nurse, is, seen, on, the, far, right, in, anguish, brutus, sits, on, the, left, alone, brooding, seemingly, dismissing, the, dead, bodies, of, his, sons, knowing, what, he, did, was, best, for, his, country, but, the, tense, posture, of, his, feet, and, toes, reveals, his, inner, turmoil, the, whole, painting, was, a, republican, symbol, and, obviously, had, immense, meaning, during, these, times, in, france, it, exemplified, civic, virtue, a, value, highly, regarded, during, the, revolution, in, the, beginning, david, was, a, supporter, of, the, revolution, a, friend, of, robespierre, and, a, member, of, the, jacobin, club, while, others, were, leaving, the, country, for, new, and, greater, opportunities, david, stayed, behind, to, help, destroy, the, old, order, he, was, a, regicide, who, voted, in, the, national, convention, for, the, execution, of, louis, xvi, it, is, uncertain, why, he, did, this, as, there, were, many, more, opportunities, for, him, under, the, king, than, the, new, order, some, people, suggest, david, s, love, for, the, classical, made, him, embrace, everything, about, that, period, including, a, republican, government, others, believed, that, they, found, the, key, to, the, artist, s, revolutionary, career, in, his, personality, undoubtedly, david, s, artistic, sensibility, mercurial, temperament, volatile, emotions, ardent, enthusiasm, and, fierce, independence, might, have, been, expected, to, help, turn, him, against, the, established, order, but, they, did, not, fully, explain, his, devotion, to, the, republican, regime, nor, did, the, vague, statements, of, those, who, insisted, upon, his, powerful, ambition, and, unusual, energy, of, will, actually, account, for, his, revolutionary, connections, those, who, knew, him, maintained, that, generous, ardor, high, minded, idealism, and, well, meaning, though, sometimes, fanatical, enthusiasm, rather, than, opportunism, and, jealousy, motivated, his, activities, during, this, period, soon, david, turned, his, critical, sights, on, the, royal, academy, of, painting, and, sculpture, this, attack, was, probably, caused, primarily, by, the, hypocrisy, of, the, organization, and, their, personal, opposition, to, his, work, as, seen, in, previous, episodes, in, david, s, life, the, royal, academy, was, controlled, by, royalists, who, opposed, david, s, attempts, at, reform, so, the, national, assembly, finally, ordered, it, to, make, changes, to, conform, to, the, new, constitution, david, then, began, work, on, something, that, would, later, hound, him, propaganda, for, the, new, republic, david, s, painting, of, brutus, was, shown, during, the, play, brutus, by, voltaire, in, 1789, jacques, louis, david, attempted, to, leave, his, artistic, mark, on, the, historical, beginnings, of, the, french, revolution, with, his, painting, of, the, oath, of, the, tennis, court, david, undertook, this, task, not, out, of, personal, political, conviction, but, rather, because, he, was, commissioned, to, do, so, the, painting, was, meant, to, commemorate, the, event, of, the, same, name, but, was, never, completed, a, meeting, of, the, estates, general, was, convened, in, may, to, address, reforms, of, the, monarchy, dissent, arose, over, whether, the, three, estates, would, meet, separately, as, had, been, tradition, or, as, one, body, the, king, s, acquiescence, in, the, demands, of, the, upper, orders, led, to, the, deputies, of, the, third, estate, renaming, themselves, as, the, national, assembly, on, 17, june, they, were, locked, out, of, the, meeting, hall, three, days, later, when, they, attempted, to, meet, and, forced, to, reconvene, to, the, royal, indoor, tennis, court, presided, over, by, jean, sylvain, bailly, they, made, a, solemn, oath, never, to, separate, until, a, national, constitution, had, been, created, in, 1789, this, event, was, seen, as, a, symbol, of, the, national, unity, against, the, ancien, regime, rejecting, the, current, conditions, the, oath, signified, a, new, transition, in, human, history, and, ideology, david, was, enlisted, by, the, society, of, friends, of, the, constitution, the, body, that, would, eventually, form, the, jacobins, to, enshrine, this, symbolic, event, this, instance, is, notable, in, more, ways, than, one, because, it, eventually, led, david, to, finally, become, involved, in, politics, as, he, joined, the, jacobins, the, picture, was, meant, to, be, massive, in, scale, the, figures, in, the, foreground, were, to, be, life, sized, portraits, of, the, counterparts, including, jean, sylvain, bailly, the, president, of, the, constituent, assembly, seeking, additional, funding, david, turned, to, the, society, of, friends, of, the, constitution, the, funding, for, the, project, was, to, come, from, over, three, thousand, subscribers, hoping, to, receive, a, print, of, the, image, however, when, the, funding, was, insufficient, the, state, ended, up, financing, the, project, david, set, out, in, 1790, to, transform, the, contemporary, event, into, a, major, historical, picture, which, would, appear, at, the, salon, of, 1791, as, a, large, pen, and, ink, drawing, as, in, the, oath, of, the, horatii, david, represents, the, unity, of, men, in, the, service, of, a, patriotic, ideal, the, outstretched, arms, which, are, prominent, in, both, works, betray, david, s, deeply, held, belief, that, acts, of, republican, virtue, akin, to, those, of, the, romans, were, being, played, out, in, france, in, what, was, essentially, an, act, of, intellect, and, reason, david, creates, an, air, of, drama, in, this, work, the, very, power, of, the, people, appears, to, be, blowing, through, the, scene, with, the, stormy, weather, in, a, sense, alluding, to, the, storm, that, would, be, the, revolution, symbolism, in, this, work, of, art, closely, represents, the, revolutionary, events, taking, place, at, the, time, the, figure, in, the, middle, is, raising, his, right, arm, making, the, oath, that, they, will, never, disband, until, they, have, reached, their, goal, of, creating, a, constitution, of, the, realm, fixed, upon, solid, foundations, the, importance, of, this, symbol, is, highlighted, by, the, fact, that, the, crowd, s, arms, are, angled, to, his, hand, forming, a, triangular, shape, additionally, the, open, space, in, the, top, half, contrasted, to, the, commotion, in, the, lower, half, serves, to, emphasize, the, magnitude, of, the, tennis, court, oath, in, his, attempt, to, depict, political, events, of, the, revolution, in, real, time, david, was, venturing, down, a, new, and, untrodden, path, in, the, art, world, however, thomas, crow, argues, that, this, path, proved, to, be, less, a, way, forward, than, a, cul, de, sac, for, history, painting, essentially, the, history, of, the, demise, of, david, s, the, tennis, court, oath, illustrates, the, difficulty, of, creating, works, of, art, that, portray, current, and, controversial, political, occurrences, political, circumstances, in, france, proved, too, volatile, to, allow, the, completion, of, the, painting, the, unity, that, was, to, be, symbolized, in, the, tennis, court, oath, no, longer, existed, in, radicalized, 1792, the, national, assembly, had, split, between, conservatives, and, radical, jacobins, both, vying, for, political, power, by, 1792, there, was, no, longer, consensus, that, all, the, revolutionaries, at, the, tennis, court, were, heroes, a, sizeable, number, of, the, heroes, of, 1789, had, become, the, villains, of, 1792, in, this, unstable, political, climate, david, s, work, remained, unfinished, with, only, a, few, nude, figures, sketched, onto, the, massive, canvas, david, abandoned, the, oath, of, the, tennis, court, to, have, completed, it, would, have, been, politically, unsound, after, this, incident, when, david, attempted, to, make, a, political, statement, in, his, paintings, he, returned, to, the, less, politically, charged, use, of, metaphor, to, convey, his, message, when, voltaire, died, in, 1778, the, church, denied, him, a, church, burial, and, his, body, was, interred, near, a, monastery, a, year, later, voltaire, s, old, friends, began, a, campaign, to, have, his, body, buried, in, the, panth, on, as, church, property, had, been, confiscated, by, the, french, government, in, 1791, david, was, appointed, to, head, the, organizing, committee, for, the, ceremony, a, parade, through, the, streets, of, paris, to, the, panth, on, despite, rain, and, opposition, from, conservatives, due, to, the, amount, of, money, spent, the, procession, went, ahead, up, to, 100, 000, people, watched, the, father, of, the, revolution, being, carried, to, his, resting, place, this, was, the, first, of, many, large, festivals, organized, by, david, for, the, republic, he, went, on, to, organize, festivals, for, martyrs, that, died, fighting, royalists, these, funerals, echoed, the, religious, festivals, of, the, pagan, greeks, and, romans, and, are, seen, by, many, as, saturnalian, david, incorporated, many, revolutionary, symbols, into, these, theatrical, performances, and, orchestrated, ceremonial, rituals, in, effect, radicalizing, the, applied, arts, themselves, the, most, popular, symbol, for, which, david, was, responsible, as, propaganda, minister, was, drawn, from, classical, greek, images, changing, and, transforming, them, with, contemporary, politics, in, an, elaborate, festival, held, on, the, anniversary, of, the, revolt, that, brought, the, monarchy, to, its, knees, david, s, hercules, figure, was, revealed, in, a, procession, following, the, goddess, of, liberty, marianne, liberty, the, symbol, of, enlightenment, ideals, was, here, being, overturned, by, the, hercules, symbol, that, of, strength, and, passion, for, the, protection, of, the, republic, against, disunity, and, factionalism, in, his, speech, during, the, procession, david, explicitly, emphasized, the, opposition, between, people, and, monarchy, hercules, was, chosen, after, all, to, make, this, opposition, more, evident, the, ideals, that, david, linked, to, his, hercules, single, handedly, transformed, the, figure, from, a, sign, of, the, old, regime, into, a, powerful, new, symbol, of, revolution, david, turned, him, into, the, representation, of, a, collective, popular, power, he, took, one, of, the, favorite, signs, of, monarchy, and, reproduced, elevated, and, monumentalized, it, into, the, sign, of, its, opposite, hercules, the, image, became, to, the, revolutionaries, something, to, rally, around, in, june, 1791, the, king, made, an, ill, fated, attempt, to, flee, the, country, but, was, apprehended, short, of, his, goal, on, the, austrian, netherlands, border, and, was, forced, to, return, under, guard, to, paris, louis, xvi, had, made, secret, requests, to, emperor, leopold, ii, of, austria, marie, antoinette, s, brother, to, restore, him, to, his, throne, this, was, granted, and, austria, threatened, france, if, the, royal, couple, were, hurt, in, reaction, the, people, arrested, the, king, this, led, to, an, invasion, after, the, trials, and, execution, of, louis, and, marie, antoinette, the, bourbon, monarchy, was, destroyed, by, the, french, people, in, 1792, it, would, be, restored, after, napoleon, then, destroyed, again, with, the, restoration, of, the, house, of, bonaparte, when, the, new, national, convention, held, its, first, meeting, david, was, sitting, with, his, friends, jean, paul, marat, and, robespierre, in, the, convention, david, soon, earned, the, nickname, ferocious, terrorist, robespierre, s, agents, discovered, a, secret, vault, containing, the, king, s, correspondence, which, proved, he, was, trying, to, overthrow, the, government, and, demanded, his, execution, the, national, convention, held, the, trial, of, louis, xvi, david, voted, for, the, death, of, the, king, causing, his, wife, marguerite, charlotte, a, royalist, to, divorce, him, when, louis, xvi, was, executed, on, 21, january, 1793, another, man, had, already, died, as, well, louis, michel, le, peletier, de, saint, fargeau, le, peletier, was, killed, on, the, preceding, day, by, a, royal, bodyguard, in, revenge, for, having, voted, for, the, death, of, the, king, david, was, called, upon, to, organize, a, funeral, and, he, painted, le, peletier, assassinated, in, it, the, assassin, s, sword, was, seen, hanging, by, a, single, strand, of, horsehair, above, le, peletier, s, body, a, concept, inspired, by, the, proverbial, ancient, tale, of, the, sword, of, damocles, which, illustrated, the, insecurity, of, power, and, position, this, underscored, the, courage, displayed, by, le, peletier, and, his, companions, in, routing, an, oppressive, king, the, sword, pierces, a, piece, of, paper, on, which, is, written, i, vote, the, death, of, the, tyrant, and, as, a, tribute, at, the, bottom, right, of, the, picture, david, placed, the, inscription, david, to, le, peletier, 20, january, 1793, the, painting, was, later, destroyed, by, le, peletier, s, royalist, daughter, and, is, known, by, only, a, drawing, an, engraving, and, contemporary, accounts, nevertheless, this, work, was, important, in, david, s, career, because, it, was, the, first, completed, painting, of, the, french, revolution, made, in, less, than, three, months, and, a, work, through, which, he, initiated, the, regeneration, process, that, would, continue, with, the, death, of, marat, david, s, masterpiece, on, 13, july, 1793, david, s, friend, marat, was, assassinated, by, charlotte, corday, with, a, knife, she, had, hidden, in, her, clothing, she, gained, entrance, to, marat, s, house, on, the, pretense, of, presenting, him, a, list, of, people, who, should, be, executed, as, enemies, of, france, marat, thanked, her, and, said, that, they, would, be, guillotined, next, week, upon, which, corday, immediately, fatally, stabbed, him, she, was, guillotined, shortly, thereafter, corday, was, of, an, opposing, political, party, whose, name, can, be, seen, in, the, note, marat, holds, in, david, s, subsequent, painting, the, death, of, marat, marat, a, member, of, the, national, convention, and, a, journalist, had, a, skin, disease, that, caused, him, to, itch, horribly, the, only, relief, he, could, get, was, in, his, bath, over, which, he, improvised, a, desk, to, write, his, list, of, suspect, counter, revolutionaries, who, were, to, be, quickly, tried, and, if, convicted, guillotined, david, once, again, organized, a, spectacular, funeral, and, marat, was, buried, in, the, panth, on, marat, s, body, was, to, be, placed, upon, a, roman, bed, his, wound, displayed, and, his, right, arm, extended, holding, the, pen, which, he, had, used, to, defend, the, republic, and, its, people, this, concept, was, to, be, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, corpse, had, begun, to, putrefy, marat, s, body, had, to, be, periodically, sprinkled, with, water, and, vinegar, as, the, public, crowded, to, see, his, corpse, prior, to, the, funeral, on, 15, and, 16, july, the, stench, became, so, bad, however, that, the, funeral, had, to, be, brought, forward, to, the, evening, of, 16, july, the, death, of, marat, perhaps, david, s, most, famous, painting, has, been, called, the, piet, of, the, revolution, upon, presenting, the, painting, to, the, convention, he, said, citizens, the, people, were, again, calling, for, their, friend, their, desolate, voice, was, heard, david, take, up, your, brushes, avenge, marat, i, heard, the, voice, of, the, people, i, obeyed, the, death, of, marat, 1793, became, the, leading, image, of, the, terror, and, immortalized, both, marat, and, david, in, the, world, of, the, revolution, this, piece, stands, today, as, a, moving, testimony, to, what, can, be, achieved, when, an, artist, s, political, convictions, are, directly, manifested, in, his, work, a, political, martyr, was, instantly, created, as, david, portrayed, marat, with, all, the, marks, of, the, real, murder, in, a, fashion, which, greatly, resembles, that, of, christ, or, his, disciples, the, subject, although, realistically, depicted, remains, lifeless, in, a, rather, supernatural, composition, with, the, surrogate, tombstone, placed, in, front, of, him, and, the, almost, holy, light, cast, upon, the, whole, scene, alluding, to, an, out, of, this, world, existence, atheists, though, they, were, david, and, marat, like, so, many, other, fervent, social, reformers, of, the, modern, world, seem, to, have, created, a, new, kind, of, religion, at, the, very, center, of, these, beliefs, there, stood, the, republic, after, the, king, s, execution, war, broke, out, between, the, new, republic, and, virtually, every, major, power, in, europe, david, as, a, member, of, the, committee, of, general, security, contributed, directly, to, the, reign, of, terror, david, organized, his, last, festival, the, festival, of, the, supreme, being, robespierre, had, realized, what, a, tremendous, propaganda, tool, these, festivals, were, and, he, decided, to, create, a, new, religion, mixing, moral, ideas, with, the, republic, and, based, on, the, ideas, of, rousseau, this, process, had, already, begun, by, confiscating, church, lands, and, requiring, priests, to, take, an, oath, to, the, state, the, festivals, called, f, tes, would, be, the, method, of, indoctrination, on, the, appointed, day, 20, prairial, by, the, revolutionary, calendar, robespierre, spoke, descended, steps, and, with, a, torch, presented, to, him, by, david, incinerated, a, cardboard, image, symbolizing, atheism, revealing, an, image, of, wisdom, underneath, soon, the, war, began, to, go, well, french, troops, marched, across, the, southern, half, of, the, netherlands, which, would, later, become, belgium, and, the, emergency, that, had, placed, the, committee, of, public, safety, in, control, was, no, more, then, plotters, seized, robespierre, at, the, national, convention, and, he, was, later, guillotined, in, effect, ending, the, reign, of, terror, as, robespierre, was, arrested, david, yelled, to, his, friend, if, you, drink, hemlock, i, shall, drink, it, with, you, after, this, he, supposedly, fell, ill, and, did, not, attend, the, evening, session, because, of, stomach, pain, which, saved, him, from, being, guillotined, along, with, robespierre, david, was, arrested, and, placed, in, prison, twice, first, from, 2, august, to, 28, december, 1794, and, then, from, 29, may, to, 3, august, 1795, most, of, the, time, he, served, his, sentence, in, the, not, uncomfortable, palais, du, luxembourg, in, paris, there, he, painted, his, own, portrait, showing, him, much, younger, than, he, actually, was, as, well, as, that, of, his, jailer, after, david, s, wife, visited, him, in, jail, he, conceived, the, idea, of, telling, the, story, of, the, rape, of, the, sabine, women, the, sabine, women, enforcing, peace, by, running, between, the, combatants, also, called, the, intervention, of, the, sabine, women, is, said, to, have, been, painted, to, honor, his, wife, with, the, theme, being, love, prevailing, over, conflict, the, painting, was, also, seen, as, a, plea, for, the, people, to, reunite, after, the, bloodshed, of, the, revolution, david, conceived, a, new, style, for, this, painting, one, which, he, called, the, pure, greek, style, as, opposed, to, the, roman, style, of, his, earlier, historical, paintings, the, new, style, was, influenced, heavily, by, the, work, of, art, historian, johann, joachim, winckelmann, in, david, s, words, the, most, prominent, general, characteristics, of, the, greek, masterpieces, are, a, noble, simplicity, and, silent, greatness, in, pose, as, well, as, in, expression, instead, of, the, muscularity, and, angularity, of, the, figures, of, his, past, works, these, were, smoother, more, feminine, and, painterly, this, work, also, brought, him, to, the, attention, of, napoleon, the, story, for, the, painting, is, as, follows, the, romans, have, abducted, the, daughters, of, their, neighbors, the, sabines, to, avenge, this, abduction, the, sabines, attacked, rome, although, not, immediately, since, hersilia, the, daughter, of, tatius, the, leader, of, the, sabines, had, been, married, to, romulus, the, roman, leader, and, then, had, two, children, by, him, in, the, interim, here, we, see, hersilia, between, her, father, and, husband, as, she, adjures, the, warriors, on, both, sides, not, to, take, wives, away, from, their, husbands, or, mothers, away, from, their, children, the, other, sabine, women, join, in, her, exhortations, during, this, time, the, martyrs, of, the, revolution, were, taken, from, the, pantheon, and, buried, in, common, ground, and, revolutionary, statues, were, destroyed, when, david, was, finally, released, to, the, country, france, had, changed, his, wife, managed, to, get, him, released, from, prison, and, he, wrote, letters, to, his, former, wife, and, told, her, he, never, ceased, loving, her, he, remarried, her, in, 1796, finally, wholly, restored, to, his, position, he, retreated, to, his, studio, took, pupils, and, for, the, most, part, retired, from, politics, in, august, 1796, david, and, many, other, artists, signed, a, petition, orchestrated, by, quatrem, re, de, quincy, which, questioned, the, wisdom, of, the, planned, seizure, of, works, of, art, from, rome, the, director, barras, believed, that, david, was, tricked, into, signing, although, one, of, david, s, students, recalled, that, in, 1798, his, master, lamented, the, fact, that, masterpieces, had, been, imported, from, italy, david, s, close, association, with, the, committee, of, public, safety, during, the, terror, resulted, in, his, signing, of, the, death, warrant, for, alexandre, de, beauharnais, a, minor, noble, beauharnais, s, widow, jos, phine, went, on, to, marry, napoleon, bonaparte, and, became, his, empress, david, himself, depicted, their, coronation, in, the, coronation, of, napoleon, and, josephine, 2, december, 1804, david, had, been, an, admirer, of, napoleon, from, their, first, meeting, struck, by, bonaparte, s, classical, features, requesting, a, sitting, from, the, busy, and, impatient, general, david, was, able, to, sketch, napoleon, in, 1797, david, recorded, the, face, of, the, conqueror, of, italy, but, the, full, composition, of, napoleon, holding, the, peace, treaty, with, austria, remains, unfinished, this, was, likely, a, decision, by, napoleon, himself, after, considering, the, current, political, situation, he, may, have, considered, the, publicity, the, portrait, would, bring, about, to, be, ill, timed, bonaparte, had, high, esteem, for, david, and, asked, him, to, accompany, him, to, egypt, in, 1798, but, david, refused, seemingly, unwilling, to, give, up, the, material, comfort, safety, and, peace, of, mind, he, had, obtained, through, the, years, draftsman, and, engraver, dominique, vivant, denon, went, to, egypt, instead, providing, mostly, documentary, and, archaeological, work, after, napoleon, s, successful, coup, d, tat, in, 1799, as, first, consul, he, commissioned, david, to, commemorate, his, daring, crossing, of, the, alps, the, crossing, of, the, st, bernard, pass, had, allowed, the, french, to, surprise, the, austrian, army, and, win, victory, at, the, battle, of, marengo, on, 14, june, 1800, although, napoleon, had, crossed, the, alps, on, a, mule, he, requested, that, he, be, portrayed, calm, upon, a, fiery, steed, david, complied, with, napoleon, crossing, the, saint, bernard, after, the, proclamation, of, the, empire, in, 1804, david, became, the, official, court, painter, of, the, regime, during, this, period, he, took, students, one, of, whom, was, the, belgian, painter, pieter, van, hanselaere, one, of, the, works, david, was, commissioned, for, was, the, coronation, of, napoleon, 1805, 1807, david, was, permitted, to, watch, the, event, he, had, plans, of, notre, dame, delivered, and, participants, in, the, coronation, came, to, his, studio, to, pose, individually, though, never, the, emperor, the, only, time, david, obtained, a, sitting, from, napoleon, had, been, in, 1797, david, did, manage, to, get, a, private, sitting, with, the, empress, jos, phine, and, napoleon, s, sister, caroline, murat, through, the, intervention, of, erstwhile, art, patron, marshal, joachim, murat, the, emperor, s, brother, in, law, for, his, background, david, had, the, choir, of, notre, dame, act, as, his, fill, in, characters, pope, pius, vii, came, to, sit, for, the, painting, and, actually, blessed, david, napoleon, came, to, see, the, painter, stared, at, the, canvas, for, an, hour, and, said, david, i, salute, you, david, had, to, redo, several, parts, of, the, painting, because, of, napoleon, s, various, whims, and, for, this, painting, he, received, twenty, four, thousand, francs, david, was, made, a, chevalier, de, la, l, gion, d, honneur, in, 1803, he, was, promoted, to, an, officier, in, 1808, and, in, 1815, he, was, promoted, to, a, commandant, now, commandeur, de, la, l, gion, d, honneur, on, the, bourbons, returning, to, power, david, figured, in, the, list, of, proscribed, former, revolutionaries, and, bonapartists, for, having, voted, execution, for, the, deposed, king, louis, xvi, and, for, participating, in, the, death, of, louis, xvii, the, deposed, king, s, son, who, was, mistreated, starved, and, forced, into, a, false, confession, of, incest, with, his, mother, queen, marie, antoinette, which, contributed, to, her, death, sentence, the, newly, restored, bourbon, king, louis, xviii, however, granted, amnesty, to, david, and, even, offered, him, the, position, of, court, painter, david, refused, preferring, self, exile, in, brussels, there, he, trained, and, influenced, brussels, artists, such, as, fran, ois, joseph, navez, and, ignace, brice, painted, cupid, and, psyche, and, quietly, lived, the, remainder, of, his, life, with, his, wife, whom, he, had, remarried, in, that, time, he, painted, smaller, scale, mythological, scenes, and, portraits, of, citizens, of, brussels, and, napoleonic, migr, s, such, as, the, baron, gerard, david, created, his, last, great, work, mars, being, disarmed, by, venus, and, the, three, graces, from, 1822, to, 1824, in, december, 1823, he, wrote, this, is, the, last, picture, i, want, to, paint, but, i, want, to, surpass, myself, in, it, i, will, put, the, date, of, my, seventy, five, years, on, it, and, afterwards, i, will, never, again, pick, up, my, brush, the, finished, painting, evoking, painted, porcelain, because, of, its, limpid, coloration, was, exhibited, first, in, brussels, then, in, paris, where, his, former, students, flocked, to, view, it, the, exhibition, was, profitable, 13, 000, francs, after, deducting, operating, costs, thus, more, than, 10, 000, people, visited, and, viewed, the, painting, in, his, later, years, david, remained, in, full, command, of, his, artistic, faculties, even, after, a, stroke, in, the, spring, of, 1825, disfigured, his, face, and, slurred, his, speech, in, june, 1825, he, resolved, to, embark, on, an, improved, version, of, his, the, anger, of, achilles, also, known, as, the, sacrifice, of, iphigenie, the, earlier, version, was, completed, in, 1819, and, is, now, in, the, collection, of, the, kimbell, art, museum, in, fort, worth, texas, david, remarked, to, his, friends, who, visited, his, studio, this, is, what, is, killing, me, such, was, his, determination, to, complete, the, work, but, by, october, it, must, have, already, been, well, advanced, as, his, former, pupil, gros, wrote, to, congratulate, him, having, heard, reports, of, the, painting, s, merits, by, the, time, david, died, the, painting, had, been, completed, and, the, commissioner, ambroise, firmin, didot, brought, it, back, to, paris, to, include, it, in, the, exhibition, pour, les, grecs, that, he, had, organised, and, which, opened, in, paris, in, april, 1826, when, david, was, leaving, a, theater, the, driver, of, a, carriage, struck, him, and, he, later, died, on, 29, december, 1825, at, his, death, some, portraits, were, auctioned, in, paris, they, sold, for, little, the, famous, death, of, marat, was, exhibited, in, a, secluded, room, to, avoid, outraging, public, sensibilities, disallowed, return, to, france, for, burial, for, having, been, a, regicide, of, king, louis, xvi, the, body, of, the, painter, jacques, louis, david, was, buried, in, brussels, and, moved, in, 1882, to, brussels, cemetery, while, some, say, his, heart, was, buried, with, his, wife, at, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, paris, the, theme, of, the, oath, found, in, several, works, such, as, the, oath, of, the, tennis, court, the, distribution, of, the, eagles, and, leonidas, at, thermopylae, was, perhaps, inspired, by, the, rituals, of, freemasonry, in, 1989, during, the, david, against, david, conference, albert, boime, presented, evidence, a, document, dated, in, 1787, showing, the, painter, s, membership, in, the, la, moderation, masonic, lodge, jacques, louis, david, s, facial, abnormalities, were, traditionally, reported, to, be, a, consequence, of, a, deep, facial, sword, wound, after, a, fencing, incident, these, left, him, with, a, noticeable, asymmetry, during, facial, expression, and, resulted, in, his, difficulty, in, eating, or, speaking, he, could, not, pronounce, some, consonants, such, as, the, letter, r, a, sword, scar, wound, on, the, left, side, of, his, face, is, present, in, his, self, portrait, and, sculptures, and, corresponds, to, some, of, the, buccal, branches, of, the, facial, nerve, an, injury, to, this, nerve, and, its, branches, are, likely, to, have, resulted, in, the, difficulties, with, his, left, facial, movement, furthermore, as, a, result, of, this, injury, he, suffered, from, a, growth, on, his, face, that, biographers, and, art, historians, have, defined, as, a, benign, tumor, these, however, may, have, been, a, granuloma, or, even, a, post, traumatic, neuroma, as, historian, simon, schama, has, pointed, out, witty, banter, and, public, speaking, ability, were, key, aspects, of, the, social, culture, of, 18th, century, france, so, david, s, tumor, could, have, been, a, heavy, obstacle, in, his, social, life, david, was, sometimes, referred, to, as, david, of, the, tumor, in, addition, to, his, history, paintings, david, completed, a, number, of, privately, commissioned, portraits, warren, roberts, among, others, has, pointed, out, the, contrast, between, david, s, public, style, of, painting, as, shown, in, his, history, paintings, and, his, private, style, as, shown, in, his, portraits, his, portraits, were, characterized, by, a, sense, of, truth, and, realism, he, focused, on, defining, his, subjects, features, and, characters, without, idealizing, them, this, is, different, from, the, style, seen, in, his, historical, paintings, in, which, he, idealizes, his, figures, features, and, bodies, to, align, with, greek, and, roman, ideals, of, beauty, he, puts, a, great, deal, of, detail, into, his, portraits, defining, smaller, features, such, as, hands, and, fabric, the, compositions, of, his, portraits, remain, simple, with, blank, backgrounds, that, allow, the, viewer, to, focus, on, the, details, of, the, subject, the, portrait, he, did, of, his, wife, 1813, is, an, example, of, his, typical, portrait, style, the, background, is, dark, and, simple, without, any, clues, as, to, the, setting, which, forces, the, viewer, to, focus, entirely, on, her, her, features, are, un, idealized, and, truthful, to, her, appearance, there, is, a, great, amount, of, detail, that, can, be, seen, in, his, attention, to, portraying, the, satin, material, of, the, dress, she, wears, the, drapery, of, the, scarf, around, her, and, her, hands, which, rest, in, her, lap, in, the, painting, of, brutus, 1789, the, man, and, his, wife, are, separated, both, morally, and, physically, paintings, such, as, these, depicting, the, great, strength, of, patriotic, sacrifice, made, david, a, popular, hero, of, the, revolution, in, the, portrait, of, antoine, laurent, lavoisier, and, his, wife, 1788, the, man, and, his, wife, are, tied, together, in, an, intimate, pose, she, leans, on, his, shoulder, while, he, pauses, from, his, work, to, look, up, at, her, david, casts, them, in, a, soft, light, not, in, the, sharp, contrast, of, brutus, or, of, the, horatii, also, of, interest, lavoisier, was, a, tax, collector, as, well, as, a, famous, chemist, though, he, spent, some, of, his, money, trying, to, clean, up, swamps, and, eradicate, malaria, he, was, nonetheless, sent, to, the, guillotine, during, the, reign, of, terror, as, an, enemy, of, the, people, david, then, a, powerful, member, of, the, national, assembly, stood, idly, by, and, watched, other, portraits, include, paintings, of, his, sister, in, law, and, her, husband, madame, and, monsieur, seriziat, the, picture, of, monsieur, seriziat, depicts, a, man, of, wealth, sitting, comfortably, with, his, horse, riding, equipment, the, picture, of, the, madame, shows, her, wearing, an, unadorned, white, dress, holding, her, young, child, s, hand, as, they, lean, against, a, bed, david, painted, these, portraits, of, madame, and, monsieur, seriziat, out, of, gratitude, for, letting, him, stay, with, them, after, he, was, in, jail, towards, the, end, of, david, s, life, he, painted, a, portrait, of, his, old, friend, abb, siey, s, both, had, been, involved, in, the, revolution, both, had, survived, the, purging, of, political, radicals, that, followed, the, reign, of, terror, the, shift, in, david, s, perspective, played, an, important, role, in, the, paintings, of, david, s, later, life, including, this, one, of, siey, s, during, the, height, of, the, terror, david, was, an, ardent, supporter, of, radicals, such, as, robespierre, and, marat, and, twice, offered, up, his, life, in, their, defense, he, organized, revolutionary, festivals, and, painted, portraits, of, martyrs, of, the, revolution, such, as, lepeletier, who, was, assassinated, for, voting, for, the, death, of, the, king, david, was, an, impassioned, speaker, at, times, in, the, national, assembly, in, speaking, to, the, assembly, about, the, young, boy, named, bara, another, martyr, of, the, revolution, david, said, o, bara, o, viala, the, blood, that, you, have, spread, still, smokes, it, rises, toward, heaven, and, cries, for, vengeance, after, robespierre, was, sent, to, the, guillotine, however, david, was, imprisoned, and, changed, the, attitude, of, his, rhetoric, during, his, imprisonment, he, wrote, many, letters, pleading, his, innocence, in, one, he, wrote, i, am, prevented, from, returning, to, my, atelier, which, alas, i, should, never, have, left, i, believed, that, in, accepting, the, most, honorable, position, but, very, difficult, to, fill, that, of, legislator, that, a, righteous, heart, would, suffice, but, i, lacked, the, second, quality, understanding, later, while, explaining, his, developing, grecian, style, for, paintings, such, as, the, intervention, of, the, sabine, women, david, further, commented, on, a, shift, in, attitude, in, all, human, activity, the, violent, and, transitory, develops, first, repose, and, profundity, appear, last, the, recognition, of, these, latter, qualities, requires, time, only, great, masters, have, them, while, their, pupils, have, access, only, to, violent, passions, jacques, louis, david, was, in, his, time, regarded, as, the, leading, painter, in, france, and, arguably, all, of, western, europe, many, of, the, painters, honored, by, the, restored, bourbons, following, the, french, revolution, had, been, david, s, pupils, david, s, student, antoine, jean, gros, for, example, was, made, a, baron, and, honored, by, napoleon, bonaparte, s, court, another, pupil, of, david, s, jean, auguste, dominique, ingres, became, the, most, important, artist, of, the, restored, royal, academy, and, the, figurehead, of, the, neoclassical, school, of, art, engaging, the, increasingly, popular, romantic, school, of, art, that, was, beginning, to, challenge, neoclassicism, david, invested, in, the, formation, of, young, artists, for, the, rome, prize, which, was, also, a, way, to, pursue, his, old, rivalry, with, other, contemporary, painters, such, as, joseph, beno, t, suv, e, who, had, also, started, teaching, classes, to, be, one, of, david, s, students, was, considered, prestigious, and, earned, his, students, a, lifetime, reputation, he, called, on, the, more, advanced, students, such, as, j, r, me, martin, langlois, to, help, him, paint, his, large, canvases, musician, and, artist, therese, emilie, henriette, winkel, and, painter, jean, baptiste, vermay, also, studied, with, david, despite, david, s, reputation, he, was, more, fiercely, criticized, right, after, his, death, than, at, any, point, during, his, life, his, style, came, under, the, most, serious, criticism, for, being, static, rigid, and, uniform, throughout, all, his, work, david, s, art, was, also, attacked, for, being, cold, and, lacking, warmth, david, however, made, his, career, precisely, by, challenging, what, he, saw, as, the, earlier, rigidity, and, conformity, of, the, french, royal, academy, s, approach, to, art, david, s, later, works, also, reflect, his, growth, in, the, development, of, the, empire, style, notable, for, its, dynamism, and, warm, colors, it, is, likely, that, much, of, the, criticism, of, david, following, his, death, came, from, david, s, opponents, during, his, lifetime, david, made, a, great, many, enemies, with, his, competitive, and, arrogant, personality, as, well, as, his, role, in, the, terror, david, sent, many, people, to, the, guillotine, and, personally, signed, the, death, warrants, for, king, louis, xvi, and, marie, antoinette, one, significant, episode, in, david, s, political, career, that, earned, him, a, great, deal, of, contempt, was, the, execution, of, emilie, chalgrin, a, fellow, painter, carle, vernet, had, approached, david, requesting, him, to, intervene, on, behalf, of, his, sister, chalgrin, she, had, been, accused, of, crimes, against, the, republic, most, notably, possessing, stolen, items, david, refused, to, intervene, in, her, favor,
