fray, pastells, a, prominent, member, of, the, order, in, a, letter, to, pastells, rizal, sails, close, to, the, deism, familiar, to, us, today, we, are, entirely, in, accord, in, admitting, the,

in, consequence, it, would, be, to, doubt, everything, and, then, what, is, life, for, now, then, my, faith, in, god, if, the, result, of, a, ratiocination, may, be, called, faith, is, blind, blind, in, the, sense, of, knowing, nothing, i, neither, believe, nor, disbelieve, the, qualities, which, many, attribute, to, him, before, theologians, and, philosophers, definitions, and, lucubrations, of,

to, me, i, cannot, but, reply, it, could, be, but, the, god, that, i, foreknow, is, far, more, grand, far, more, good, plus, supra, i, believe, in, revelation, but, not, in, revelation, or, revelations, which, each, religion, or, religions, claim, to, possess, examining, them, impartially, comparing, them, and, scrutinizing, them, one, cannot, avoid, discerning, the, human, fingernail, and, the, stamp, of, the, time, in, which, they, were, written, no, let, us, not, make, god, in, our, image, poor, inhabitants, that, we, are, of, a, distant, planet, lost, in, infinite, space, however, brilliant, and, sublime, our, intelligence, may, be, it, is, scarcely, more, than, a, small, spark, which, shines, and, in, an, instant, is, extinguished, and, it, alone, can, give, us, no, idea, of, that, blaze, that, conflagration, that, ocean, of, light, i, believe, in, revelation, but, in, that, living, revelation, which, surrounds, us, on, every, side, in, that, voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal, as, is, the, being, from, whom, it, proceeds, in, that, revelation, which, speaks, to, us, and, penetrates, us, from, the, moment, we, are, born, until, we, die, what, books, can, better, reveal, to, us, the, goodness, of, god, his, love, his, providence, his, eternity, his, glory, his, wisdom, the, heavens, declare, the, glory, of, god, and, the, firmament, showeth, his, handiwork, his, best, friend, professor, ferdinand, blumentritt, kept, him, in, touch, with, european, friends, and, fellow, scientists, who, wrote, a, stream, of, letters, which, arrived, in, dutch, french, german, and, english, and, which, baffled, the, censors, delaying, their, transmittal, those, four, years, of, his, exile, coincided, with, the, development, of, the, philippine, revolution, from, inception, and, to, its, final, breakout, which, from, the, viewpoint, of, the, court, which, was, to, try, him, suggested, his, complicity, in, it, he, condemned, the, uprising, although, all, the, members, of, the, katipunan, had, made, him, their, honorary, president, and, had, used, his, name, as, a, cry, for, war, unity, and, liberty, he, is, known, to, making, the, resolution, of, bearing, personal, sacrifice, instead, of, the, incoming, revolution, believing, that, a, peaceful, stand, is, the, best, way, to, avoid, further, suffering, in, the, country, and, loss, of, filipino, lives, in, rizal, s, own, words, i, consider, myself, happy, for, being, able, to, suffer, a, little, for, a, cause, which, i, believe, to, be, sacred, i, believe, further, that, in, any, undertaking, the, more, one, suffers, for, it, the, surer, its, success, if, this, be, fanaticism, may, god, pardon, me, but, my, poor, judgment, does, not, see, it, as, such, in, dapitan, rizal, wrote, haec, est, sibylla, cumana, a, parlor, game, for, his, students, with, questions, and, answers, for, which, a, wooden, top, was, used, in, 2004, jean, paul, verstraeten, traced, this, book, and, the, wooden, top, as, well, as, rizal, s, personal, watch, spoon, and, salter, by, 1896, the, rebellion, fomented, by, the, katipunan, a, militant, secret, society, had, become, a, full, blown, revolution, proving, to, be, a, nationwide, uprising, rizal, had, earlier, volunteered, his, services, as, a, doctor, in, cuba, and, was, given, leave, by, governor, general, ram, n, blanco, to, serve, in, cuba, to, minister, to, victims, of, yellow, fever, rizal, and, josephine, left, dapitan, on, august, 1, 1896, with, letter, of, recommendation, from, blanco, rizal, was, arrested, en, route, to, cuba, via, spain, and, was, imprisoned, in, barcelona, on, october, 6, 1896, he, was, sent, back, the, same, day, to, manila, to, stand, trial, as, he, was, implicated, in, the, revolution, through, his, association, with, members, of, the, katipunan, during, the, entire, passage, he, was, unchained, no, spaniard, laid, a, hand, on, him, and, had, many, opportunities, to, escape, but, refused, to, do, so, while, imprisoned, in, fort, santiago, he, issued, a, manifesto, disavowing, the, current, revolution, in, its, present, state, and, declaring, that, the, education, of, filipinos, and, their, achievement, of, a, national, identity, were, prerequisites, to, freedom, rizal, was, tried, before, a, court, martial, for, rebellion, sedition, and, conspiracy, and, was, convicted, on, all, three, charges, and, sentenced, to, death, blanco, who, was, sympathetic, to, rizal, had, been, forced, out, of, office, the, friars, led, by, then, archbishop, of, manila, bernardino, nozaleda, had, intercalated, camilo, de, polavieja, in, his, stead, as, the, new, spanish, governor, general, of, the, philippines, after, pressuring, queen, regent, maria, cristina, of, spain, thus, sealing, rizal, s, fate, moments, before, his, execution, on, december, 30, 1896, by, a, squad, of, filipino, soldiers, of, the, spanish, army, a, backup, force, of, regular, spanish, army, troops, stood, ready, to, shoot, the, executioners, should, they, fail, to, obey, orders, the, spanish, army, surgeon, general, requested, to, take, his, pulse, it, was, normal, aware, of, this, the, sergeant, commanding, the, backup, force, hushed, his, men, to, silence, when, they, began, raising, vivas, with, the, highly, partisan, crowd, of, peninsular, and, mestizo, spaniards, his, last, words, were, those, of, jesus, christ, consummatum, est, it, is, finished, a, day, before, rizal, s, mother, pleaded, with, the, authorities, to, have, rizal, s, body, placed, under, her, family, s, custody, as, per, rizal, s, wish, this, was, unheeded, but, was, later, granted, by, manuel, luengo, the, civil, governor, of, manila, immediately, following, the, execution, rizal, was, secretly, buried, in, pac, cemetery, now, paco, park, in, manila, with, no, identification, on, his, grave, intentionally, mismarked, to, mislead, and, discourage, martyrdom, his, undated, poem, mi, ltimo, adi, s, believed, to, have, been, written, a, few, days, before, his, execution, was, hidden, in, an, alcohol, stove, which, was, later, handed, to, his, family, with, his, few, remaining, possessions, including, the, final, letters, and, his, last, bequests, 91, during, their, visit, rizal, reminded, his, sisters, in, english, there, is, something, inside, it, referring, to, the, alcohol, stove, given, by, the, pardo, de, taveras, which, was, to, be, returned, after, his, execution, thereby, emphasizing, the, importance, of, the, poem, this, instruction, was, followed, by, another, look, in, my, shoes, in, which, another, item, was, secreted, rizal, s, execution, as, well, as, those, of, other, political, dissidents, mostly, anarchist, in, barcelona, was, ultimately, invoked, by, michele, angiolillo, an, italian, anarchist, when, he, assassinated, spanish, prime, minister, antonio, canovas, del, castillo, rizal, s, sister, narcisa, toured, all, possible, gravesites, only, for, her, efforts, to, end, in, vain, on, one, day, she, visited, paco, cemetery, and, discovered, guards, posted, at, its, gate, later, finding, luengo, accompanied, by, two, army, officers, standing, around, a, freshly, dug, grave, covered, with, earth, which, she, assumed, to, be, that, of, her, brother, s, on, the, reason, that, there, had, never, been, any, ground, burials, at, the, site, after, realizing, that, rizal, was, buried, in, the, spot, she, made, a, gift, to, the, caretaker, and, requested, him, to, place, a, marble, slab, inscribed, with, rpj, rizal, s, initials, in, reverse, in, august, 1898, a, few, days, after, the, americans, took, manila, narcisa, secured, the, consent, of, the, american, authorities, to, retrieve, rizal, s, remains, during, the, exhumation, it, was, then, revealed, that, rizal, was, not, buried, in, a, coffin, but, was, wrapped, in, cloth, before, being, dumped, in, the, grave, his, burial, was, not, on, sanctified, ground, granted, to, the, confessed, faithful, the, identity, of, the, remains, further, confirmed, by, both, the, black, suit, and, the, shoes, both, worn, by, rizal, on, his, execution, but, whatever, was, in, his, shoes, had, disintegrated, following, the, exhumation, the, remains, were, brought, to, the, rizal, household, in, binondo, where, they, were, washed, and, cleaned, before, being, placed, in, an, ivory, urn, made, by, romualdo, teodoro, de, los, reyes, de, jesus, the, urn, remained, in, the, household, until, december, 28, 1912, on, december, 29, the, urn, was, transferred, from, binondo, to, the, marble, hall, of, the, ayuntamiento, de, manila, the, municipal, building, in, intramuros, where, it, remained, on, public, display, from, 9, 00, a, m, to, 5, 00, p, m, guarded, by, the, caballeros, de, rizal, the, public, was, given, the, chance, to, see, the, urn, the, next, day, in, a, solemn, procession, the, urn, began, its, last, journey, from, the, ayuntamiento, to, its, last, resting, place, in, a, spot, in, bagumbayan, now, renamed, as, luneta, where, the, rizal, monument, would, be, built, witnessed, by, his, family, rizal, was, finally, buried, in, fitting, rites, in, a, simultaneous, ceremony, the, corner, stone, for, the, rizal, monument, was, placed, and, the, rizal, monument, commission, was, created, headed, by, tomas, g, del, rosario, a, year, later, on, december, 30, 1913, the, monument, designed, and, made, by, swiss, sculptor, richard, kissling, was, inaugurated, rizal, wrote, mostly, in, spanish, the, lingua, franca, of, the, spanish, east, indies, though, some, of, his, letters, for, example, sa, mga, kababaihang, taga, malolos, were, written, in, tagalog, his, works, have, since, been, translated, into, a, number, of, languages, including, tagalog, and, english, rizal, also, tried, his, hand, at, painting, and, sculpture, his, most, famous, sculptural, work, was, the, triumph, of, science, over, death, a, clay, sculpture, of, a, naked, young, woman, with, overflowing, hair, standing, on, a, skull, while, bearing, a, torch, held, high, the, woman, symbolized, the, ignorance, of, humankind, during, the, dark, ages, while, the, torch, she, bore, symbolized, the, enlightenment, science, brings, over, the, whole, world, he, sent, the, sculpture, as, a, gift, to, his, dear, friend, ferdinand, blumentritt, together, with, another, one, named, the, triumph, of, death, over, life, the, woman, is, shown, trampling, the, skull, a, symbol, of, death, to, signify, the, victory, the, humankind, achieved, by, conquering, the, bane, of, death, through, their, scientific, advancements, the, original, sculpture, is, now, displayed, at, the, rizal, shrine, at, fort, santiago, in, intramuros, manila, it, has, replicas, inside, the, university, of, the, philippines, manila, campus, and, in, alabang, muntinlupa, rizal, is, also, noted, to, be, a, carver, and, sculptor, who, made, works, from, clay, plaster, of, paris, and, baticuling, wood, the, last, being, his, preferred, medium, while, in, exile, in, dapitan, he, served, as, a, mentor, to, three, paete, natives, including, jos, caancan, who, in, turn, taught, three, generations, of, carvers, back, in, his, hometown, rizal, is, known, to, have, made, 56, sculptural, works, but, only, 18, of, these, are, known, to, be, still, existing, as, of, 2021, several, historians, report, that, rizal, retracted, his, anti, catholic, ideas, through, a, document, which, stated, i, retract, with, all, my, heart, whatever, in, my, words, writings, publications, and, conduct, have, been, contrary, to, my, character, as, a, son, of, the, catholic, church, however, there, are, doubts, of, its, authenticity, given, that, there, is, no, certificate, of, rizal, s, catholic, marriage, to, josephine, bracken, also, there, is, an, allegation, that, the, retraction, document, was, a, forgery, after, analyzing, six, major, documents, of, rizal, ricardo, pascual, concluded, that, the, retraction, document, said, to, have, been, discovered, in, 1935, was, not, in, rizal, s, handwriting, senator, rafael, palma, a, former, president, of, the, university, of, the, philippines, and, a, prominent, mason, argued, that, a, retraction, is, not, in, keeping, with, rizal, s, character, and, mature, beliefs, he, called, the, retraction, story, a, pious, fraud, others, who, deny, the, retraction, are, frank, laubach, a, protestant, minister, austin, coates, a, british, writer, and, ricardo, manapat, director, of, the, national, archives, those, who, affirm, the, authenticity, of, rizal, s, retraction, are, prominent, philippine, historians, such, as, nick, joaquin, nicolas, zafra, of, up, le, n, mar, a, guerrero, iii, gregorio, zaide, guillermo, g, mez, rivera, ambeth, ocampo, john, n, schumacher, antonio, m, molina, paul, dumol, and, austin, craig, they, take, the, retraction, document, as, authentic, having, been, judged, as, such, by, a, foremost, expert, on, the, writings, of, rizal, teodoro, kalaw, a, 33rd, degree, mason, and, handwriting, experts, known, and, recognized, in, our, courts, of, justice, h, otley, beyer, and, jos, i, del, rosario, both, of, up, historians, also, refer, to, 11, eyewitnesses, when, rizal, wrote, his, retraction, signed, a, catholic, prayer, book, and, recited, catholic, prayers, and, the, multitude, who, saw, him, kiss, the, crucifix, before, his, execution, a, great, grand, nephew, of, rizal, fr, marciano, guzman, cites, that, rizal, s, 4, confessions, were, certified, by, 5, eyewitnesses, 10, qualified, witnesses, 7, newspapers, and, 12, historians, and, writers, including, aglipayan, bishops, masons, and, anti, clericals, one, witness, was, the, head, of, the, spanish, supreme, court, at, the, time, of, his, notarized, declaration, and, was, highly, esteemed, by, rizal, for, his, integrity, because, of, what, he, sees, as, the, strength, these, direct, evidence, have, in, the, light, of, the, historical, method, in, contrast, with, merely, circumstantial, evidence, up, professor, emeritus, of, history, nicolas, zafra, called, the, retraction, a, plain, unadorned, fact, of, history, guzm, n, attributes, the, denial, of, retraction, to, the, blatant, disbelief, and, stubbornness, of, some, masons, to, explain, the, retraction, guzman, said, that, the, factors, are, the, long, discussion, and, debate, which, appealed, to, reason, and, logic, that, he, had, with, fr, balaguer, the, visits, of, his, mentors, and, friends, from, the, ateneo, and, the, grace, of, god, due, the, numerous, prayers, of, religious, communities, supporters, see, in, the, retraction, rizal, s, moral, courage, to, recognize, his, mistakes, his, reversion, to, the, true, faith, and, thus, his, unfading, glory, and, a, return, to, the, ideals, of, his, fathers, which, did, not, diminish, his, stature, as, a, great, patriot, on, the, contrary, it, increased, that, stature, to, greatness, on, the, other, hand, lawyer, and, senator, jos, w, diokno, stated, at, a, human, rights, lecture, surely, whether, rizal, died, as, a, catholic, or, an, apostate, adds, or, detracts, nothing, from, his, greatness, as, a, filipino, catholic, or, mason, rizal, is, still, rizal, the, hero, who, courted, death, to, prove, to, those, who, deny, our, patriotism, that, we, know, how, to, die, for, our, duty, and, our, beliefs, the, poem, is, more, aptly, titled, adi, s, patria, adorada, literally, farewell, beloved, fatherland, by, virtue, of, logic, and, literary, tradition, the, words, coming, from, the, first, line, of, the, poem, itself, it, first, appeared, in, print, not, in, manila, but, in, hong, kong, in, 1897, when, a, copy, of, the, poem, and, an, accompanying, photograph, came, to, j, p, braga, who, decided, to, publish, it, in, a, monthly, journal, he, edited, there, was, a, delay, when, braga, who, greatly, admired, rizal, wanted, a, good, facsimile, of, the, photograph, and, sent, it, to, be, engraved, in, london, a, process, taking, well, over, two, months, it, finally, appeared, under, mi, ltimo, pensamiento, a, title, he, supplied, and, by, which, it, was, known, for, a, few, years, thus, the, jesuit, balaguer, s, anonymous, account, of, the, retraction, and, the, marriage, to, josephine, was, published, in, barcelona, before, word, of, the, poem, s, existence, had, reached, him, and, he, could, revise, what, he, had, written, his, account, was, too, elaborate, for, rizal, to, have, had, time, to, write, adi, s, six, years, after, his, death, when, the, philippine, organic, act, of, 1902, was, being, debated, in, the, united, states, congress, representative, henry, cooper, of, wisconsin, rendered, an, english, translation, of, rizal, s, valedictory, poem, capped, by, the, peroration, under, what, clime, or, what, skies, has, tyranny, claimed, a, nobler, victim, subsequently, the, us, congress, passed, the, bill, into, law, which, is, now, known, as, the, philippine, organic, act, of, 1902, this, was, a, major, breakthrough, for, a, u, s, congress, that, had, yet, to, grant, the, equal, rights, to, african, americans, guaranteed, to, them, in, the, u, s, constitution, and, at, a, time, the, chinese, exclusion, act, was, still, in, effect, it, created, the, philippine, legislature, appointed, two, filipino, delegates, to, the, u, s, congress, extended, the, u, s, bill, of, rights, to, filipinos, and, laid, the, foundation, for, an, autonomous, government, the, colony, was, on, its, way, to, independence, the, united, states, passed, the, jones, law, that, made, the, legislature, fully, autonomous, until, 1916, but, did, not, recognize, philippine, independence, until, the, treaty, of, manila, in, 1946, fifty, years, after, rizal, s, death, this, same, poem, which, has, inspired, independence, activists, across, the, region, and, beyond, was, recited, in, its, indonesian, translation, by, rosihan, anwar, by, indonesian, soldiers, of, independence, before, going, into, battle, josephine, bracken, whom, rizal, addressed, as, his, wife, on, his, last, day, promptly, joined, the, revolutionary, forces, in, cavite, province, making, her, way, through, thicket, and, mud, across, enemy, lines, and, helped, reloading, spent, cartridges, at, the, arsenal, in, imus, under, the, revolutionary, general, pantale, n, garc, a, imus, came, under, threat, of, recapture, that, the, operation, was, moved, with, bracken, to, maragondon, the, mountain, redoubt, in, cavite, she, witnessed, the, tejeros, convention, prior, to, returning, to, manila, and, was, summoned, by, the, governor, general, but, owing, to, her, stepfather, s, american, citizenship, she, could, not, be, forcibly, deported, she, left, voluntarily, returning, to, hong, kong, she, later, married, another, filipino, vicente, abad, a, mestizo, acting, as, agent, for, the, tabacalera, firm, in, the, philippines, she, died, of, tuberculosis, in, hong, kong, on, march, 15, 1902, and, was, buried, at, the, happy, valley, cemetery, she, was, immortalized, by, rizal, in, the, last, stanza, of, mi, ultimo, adios, farewell, sweet, stranger, my, friend, my, joy, polavieja, faced, condemnation, by, his, countrymen, after, his, return, to, spain, while, visiting, girona, in, catalonia, circulars, were, distributed, among, the, crowd, bearing, rizal, s, last, verses, his, portrait, and, the, charge, that, polavieja, was, responsible, for, the, loss, of, the, philippines, to, spain, ramon, blanco, later, presented, his, sash, and, sword, to, the, rizal, family, as, an, apology, attempts, to, debunk, legends, surrounding, rizal, and, the, tug, of, war, between, freethinker, and, catholic, have, kept, his, legacy, controversial, the, confusion, over, rizal, s, real, stance, on, the, philippine, revolution, leads, to, the, sometimes, bitter, question, of, his, ranking, as, the, nation, s, premier, hero, but, then, again, according, to, the, national, historical, commission, of, the, philippines, nhcp, section, chief, teodoro, atienza, and, filipino, historian, ambeth, ocampo, there, is, no, filipino, historical, figure, including, rizal, that, was, officially, declared, a, national, hero, through, law, or, executive, order, although, there, were, laws, and, proclamations, honoring, filipino, heroes, some, suggest, that, jose, rizal, was, made, a, legislated, national, hero, by, the, american, forces, occupying, the, philippines, in, 1901, the, american, governor, general, william, howard, taft, suggested, that, the, u, s, sponsored, philippine, commission, name, rizal, a, national, hero, for, filipinos, jose, rizal, was, an, ideal, candidate, favourable, to, the, american, occupiers, since, he, was, dead, and, non, violent, a, favourable, quality, which, if, emulated, by, filipinos, would, not, threaten, the, american, rule, or, change, the, status, quo, of, the, occupiers, of, the, philippine, islands, rizal, did, not, advocate, independence, for, the, philippines, either, subsequently, the, us, sponsored, commission, passed, act, no, 346, which, set, the, anniversary, of, rizal, s, death, as, a, day, of, observance, renato, constantino, writes, rizal, is, a, united, states, sponsored, hero, who, was, promoted, as, the, greatest, filipino, hero, during, the, american, colonial, period, of, the, philippines, after, aguinaldo, lost, the, philippine, american, war, the, united, states, promoted, rizal, who, represented, peaceful, political, advocacy, in, fact, repudiation, of, violent, means, in, general, instead, of, more, radical, figures, whose, ideas, could, inspire, resistance, against, american, rule, rizal, was, selected, over, andr, s, bonifacio, who, was, viewed, too, radical, and, apolinario, mabini, who, was, considered, unregenerate, on, the, other, hand, numerous, sources, quote, that, it, was, general, emilio, aguinaldo, and, not, the, second, philippine, commission, who, first, recognized, december, 30, as, national, day, of, mourning, in, memory, of, rizal, and, other, victims, of, spanish, tyranny, as, per, them, the, first, celebration, of, rizal, day, was, held, in, manila, on, december, 30, 1898, under, the, sponsorship, of, the, club, filipino, the, veracity, of, both, claims, seems, to, be, justified, and, hence, difficult, to, ascertain, however, most, historians, agree, that, a, majority, of, filipinos, were, unaware, of, rizal, during, his, lifetime, as, he, was, a, member, of, the, richer, elite, classes, he, was, born, in, an, affluent, family, had, lived, abroad, for, nearly, as, long, as, he, had, lived, in, the, philippines, and, wrote, primarily, in, an, elite, language, at, that, time, tagalog, and, cebuano, were, the, languages, of, the, masses, about, ideals, as, lofty, as, freedom, the, masses, were, more, concerned, about, day, to, day, issues, like, earning, money, and, making, a, living, something, which, has, not, changed, much, today, teodoro, agoncillo, opines, that, the, philippine, national, hero, unlike, those, of, other, countries, is, not, the, leader, of, its, liberation, forces, he, gives, the, opinion, that, andr, s, bonifacio, not, replace, rizal, as, national, hero, as, some, have, suggested, but, that, be, honored, alongside, him, constantino, s, analysis, has, been, criticised, for, its, polemicism, and, inaccuracies, regarding, rizal, the, historian, rafael, palma, contends, that, the, revolution, of, bonifacio, is, a, consequence, wrought, by, the, writings, of, rizal, and, that, although, the, bonifacio, s, revolver, produced, an, immediate, outcome, the, pen, of, rizal, generated, a, more, lasting, achievement, others, present, him, as, a, man, of, contradictions, miguel, de, unamuno, in, rizal, the, tagalog, hamlet, said, of, him, a, soul, that, dreads, the, revolution, although, deep, down, desires, it, he, pivots, between, fear, and, hope, between, faith, and, despair, his, critics, assert, this, character, flaw, is, translated, into, his, two, novels, where, he, opposes, violence, in, noli, me, t, ngere, and, appears, to, advocate, it, in, fili, contrasting, ibarra, s, idealism, to, simoun, s, cynicism, his, defenders, insist, this, ambivalence, is, trounced, when, simoun, is, struck, down, in, the, sequel, s, final, chapters, reaffirming, the, author, s, resolute, stance, pure, and, spotless, must, the, victim, be, if, the, sacrifice, is, to, be, acceptable, many, thinkers, tend, to, find, the, characters, of, mar, a, clara, and, ibarra, noli, me, t, ngere, poor, role, models, mar, a, clara, being, too, frail, and, young, ibarra, being, too, accepting, of, circumstances, rather, than, being, courageous, and, bold, in, el, filibusterismo, rizal, had, father, florentino, say, our, liberty, will, not, be, secured, at, the, sword, s, point, we, must, secure, it, by, making, ourselves, worthy, of, it, and, when, a, people, reaches, that, height, god, will, provide, a, weapon, the, idols, will, be, shattered, tyranny, will, crumble, like, a, house, of, cards, and, liberty, will, shine, out, like, the, first, dawn, rizal, s, attitude, to, the, philippine, revolution, is, also, debated, not, only, based, on, his, own, writings, but, also, due, to, the, varying, eyewitness, accounts, of, p, o, valenzuela, a, doctor, who, in, 1895, had, consulted, rizal, in, dapitan, on, behalf, of, bonifacio, and, the, katipunan, upon, the, outbreak, of, the, philippine, revolution, in, 1896, valenzuela, surrendered, to, the, spanish, authorities, and, testified, in, military, court, that, rizal, had, strongly, condemned, an, armed, struggle, for, independence, when, valenzuela, asked, for, his, support, rizal, had, even, refused, him, entry, to, his, house, bonifacio, in, turn, had, openly, denounced, him, as, a, coward, for, his, refusal, however, years, later, valenzuela, testified, that, rizal, had, been, favorable, to, an, uprising, as, long, as, the, filipinos, were, well, prepared, and, well, supplied, with, arms, rizal, had, suggested, that, the, katipunan, get, wealthy, and, influential, filipino, members, of, society, on, their, side, or, at, least, ensure, they, would, stay, neutral, rizal, had, even, suggested, his, friend, antonio, luna, to, lead, the, revolutionary, forces, since, he, had, studied, military, science, in, the, event, that, the, katipunan, was, discovered, prematurely, they, should, fight, rather, than, allow, themselves, to, be, killed, valenzuela, said, to, historian, teodoro, agoncillo, that, he, had, lied, to, the, spanish, military, authorities, about, rizal, s, true, stance, toward, a, revolution, in, an, attempt, to, exculpate, him, before, his, execution, rizal, wrote, a, proclamation, denouncing, the, revolution, but, as, noted, by, historian, floro, quibuyen, his, final, poem, mi, ultimo, adios, contains, a, stanza, which, equates, his, coming, execution, and, the, rebels, then, dying, in, battle, as, fundamentally, the, same, as, both, are, dying, for, their, country, rizal, was, a, contemporary, of, gandhi, tagore, and, sun, yat, sen, who, also, advocated, liberty, through, peaceful, means, rather, than, by, violent, revolution, coinciding, with, the, appearance, of, those, other, leaders, rizal, from, an, early, age, had, been, enunciating, in, poems, tracts, and, plays, ideas, all, his, own, of, modern, nationhood, as, a, practical, possibility, in, asia, in, noli, me, t, ngere, he, stated, that, if, european, civilization, had, nothing, better, to, offer, colonialism, in, asia, was, doomed, though, popularly, mentioned, especially, on, blogs, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, gandhi, or, nehru, may, have, corresponded, with, rizal, nor, have, they, mentioned, him, in, any, of, their, memoirs, or, letters, but, it, was, documented, by, rizal, s, biographer, austin, coates, who, interviewed, jawaharlal, nehru, and, gandhi, that, rizal, was, mentioned, specifically, in, nehru, s, prison, letters, to, his, daughter, indira, as, a, political, figure, jos, rizal, was, the, founder, of, la, liga, filipina, a, civic, organization, that, subsequently, gave, birth, to, the, katipunan, led, by, andr, s, bonifacio, a, secret, society, which, would, start, the, philippine, revolution, against, spain, that, eventually, laid, the, foundation, of, the, first, philippine, republic, under, emilio, aguinaldo, he, was, a, proponent, of, achieving, philippine, self, government, peacefully, through, institutional, reform, rather, than, through, violent, revolution, and, would, only, support, violent, means, as, a, last, resort, rizal, believed, that, the, only, justification, for, national, liberation, and, self, government, was, the, restoration, of, the, dignity, of, the, people, saying, why, independence, if, the, slaves, of, today, will, be, the, tyrants, of, tomorrow, however, through, careful, examination, of, his, works, and, statements, including, mi, ultimo, adios, rizal, reveals, himself, as, a, revolutionary, his, image, as, the, tagalog, christ, also, intensified, early, reverence, to, him, rizal, through, his, reading, of, morga, and, other, western, historians, knew, of, the, genial, image, of, spain, s, early, relations, with, his, people, in, his, writings, he, showed, the, disparity, between, the, early, colonialists, and, those, of, his, day, with, the, latter, s, injustices, giving, rise, to, gomburza, and, the, philippine, revolution, of, 1896, the, english, biographer, austin, coates, and, writer, benedict, anderson, believe, that, rizal, gave, the, philippine, revolution, a, genuinely, national, character, and, that, rizal, s, patriotism, and, his, standing, as, one, of, asia, s, first, intellectuals, have, inspired, others, of, the, importance, of, a, national, identity, to, nation, building, the, belgian, researcher, jean, paul, jp, verstraeten, authored, several, books, about, jose, rizal, rizal, in, belgium, and, france, jose, rizal, s, europe,

folk, saint, collectively, known, as, the, rizalista, religious, movements, who, claim, him, as, a, sublimation, of, christ, in, september, 1903, he, was, canonized, as, a, saint, in, the, philippine, independent, church, however, it, was, revoked, in, the, 1950s, jos, rizal, was, imprisoned, at, fort, santiago, and, soon, after, he, was, banished, at, dapitan, where, he, plunged, himself, into, studying, nature, he, was, then, able, to, collect, a, number, of, species, of, various, classes, insects, butterflies, amphibians, reptiles, shells, snakes, and, plants, rizal, sent, many, specimens, of, animals, insects, and, plants, for, identification, to, the, anthropological, and, ethnographical, museum, of, dresden, dresden, museum, of, ethnology, it, was, not, in, his, interest, to, receive, any, monetary, payment, all, he, wanted, were, scientific, books, magazines, and, surgical, instruments, which, he, needed, and, used, in, dapitan, during, his, exile, rizal, also, secretly, sent, several, specimens, of, flying, dragons, to, europe, he, believed, that, they, were, a, new, species, the, german, zoologist, benno, wandolleck, named, them, draco, rizali, after, rizal, however, it, has, since, been, discovered, that, the, species, had, already, been, described, by, the, belgian, british, zoologist, george, albert, boulenger, in, 1885, as, draco, guentheri, there, are, three, animal, species, that, rizal, personally, collected, specimens, of, and, that, were, posthumously, named, after, him, there, are, also, other, species, discovered, afterward, in, the,
