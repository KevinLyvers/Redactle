foreign, policy, was, to, gain, the, most, advantageous, terms, for, his, family, alexander, is, one, of, the, most, controversial, of, the, renaissance, popes, partly, because, he, acknowledged, fathering, several, children, by, his, mistresses, as, a, result, his, italianized, valencian, surname, borgia, became, a, byword, for, libertinism, and, nepotism, which, are, traditionally,

of, contemporary, descriptions, of, alexander, relating, him, to, have, been, of, a, medium, complexion, with, dark, eyes, and, slightly, full, lips, of, robust, health, in, later, life, he, reports, that, his, aspect, to, be, venerable, and, far, more, august, than, an, ordinary, human, appearance, and, that, he, was, so, familiar, with, holy, writ, that, his, speeches, were, fairly, sparkling, with, well, chosen, texts, of, the, sacred, books, rodrigo, de, borja, s, career, in, the, church, began, in, 1445, at, the, age, of, 14, when, he, was, appointed, sacristan, at, the, cathedral, of, valencia, by, his, influential, uncle, alfons, cardinal, de, borja, who, had, been, appointed, a, cardinal, by, pope, eugene, iv, the, previous, year, in, 1448, borja, became, canon, at, the, cathedrals, of, valencia, barcelona, and, segorbe, his, uncle, cardinal, de, borja, persuaded, pope, nicholas, v, to, allow, young, borja, to, perform, this, role, in, absentia, and, receive, the, associated, income, so, that, borja, could, travel, to, rome, while, in, rome, rodrigo, borgia, as, his, surname, was, usually, spelled, in, italian, studied, under, gaspare, da, verona, a, humanist, tutor, he, then, studied, law, at, bologna, where, he, graduated, not, simply, as, doctor, of, law, but, as, the, most, eminent, and, judicious, jurisprudent, the, election, of, his, uncle, alfons, cardinal, de, borja, as, pope, callixtus, iii, in, 1455, enabled, borgia, s, appointments, to, other, positions, in, the, church, these, nepotistic, appointments, were, characteristic, of, the, era, each, pope, during, this, period, found, himself, surrounded, by, the, servants, and, retainers, of, his, predecessors, who, often, owed, their, loyalty, to, the, family, of, the, pontiff, who, had, appointed, them, in, 1455, he, inherited, his, uncle, s, post, as, bishop, of, valencia, and, callixtus, appointed, him, dean, of, santa, maria, in, x, tiva, the, following, year, he, was, ordained, deacon, and, created, cardinal, deacon, of, san, nicola, in, carcere, rodrigo, borgia, s, appointment, as, cardinal, only, occurred, after, callixtus, iii, asked, the, cardinals, in, rome, to, create, three, new, positions, in, the, college, of, cardinals, two, for, his, nephews, rodrigo, and, luis, juan, de, mil, and, one, for, the, prince, jaime, of, portugal, in, 1457, callixtus, iii, assigned, the, young, cardinal, de, borja, or, borgia, in, italian, to, go, to, ancona, as, a, papal, legate, to, quell, a, revolt, borgia, was, successful, in, his, mission, and, his, uncle, rewarded, him, with, his, appointment, as, vice, chancellor, of, the, holy, roman, church, the, position, of, vice, chancellor, was, both, incredibly, powerful, and, lucrative, and, borgia, held, this, post, for, 35, years, until, his, own, election, to, the, papacy, in, 1492, at, the, end, of, 1457, rodrigo, cardinal, borgia, s, elder, brother, pedro, luis, borgia, fell, ill, so, rodrigo, temporarily, filled, pedro, luis, position, as, captain, general, of, the, papal, army, until, he, recovered, in, 1458, cardinal, borgia, s, uncle, and, greatest, benefactor, pope, callixtus, died, in, the, papal, election, of, 1458, rodrigo, borgia, was, too, young, to, seek, the, papacy, himself, so, he, sought, to, support, a, cardinal, who, would, maintain, him, as, vice, chancellor, borgia, was, one, of, the, deciding, votes, in, the, election, of, cardinal, piccolomini, as, pope, pius, ii, and, the, new, pope, rewarded, borgia, not, only, with, maintaining, the, chancellorship, but, also, with, a, lucrative, abbey, benefice, and, another, titular, church, in, 1460, pope, pius, rebuked, cardinal, borgia, for, attending, a, private, party, which, pius, had, heard, turned, into, an, orgy, borgia, apologized, for, the, incident, but, denied, that, there, had, been, an, orgy, pope, pius, forgave, him, and, the, true, events, of, the, evening, remain, unknown, in, 1462, rodrigo, borgia, had, his, first, son, pedro, luis, with, an, unknown, mistress, he, sent, pedro, luis, to, grow, up, in, spain, the, following, year, borgia, acceded, to, pope, pius, s, call, for, cardinals, to, help, fund, a, new, crusade, before, embarking, to, lead, the, crusade, personally, pope, pius, ii, fell, ill, and, died, so, borgia, would, need, to, ensure, the, election, of, yet, another, ally, to, the, papacy, to, maintain, his, position, as, vice, chancellor, on, the, first, ballot, the, conclave, of, 1464, elected, borgia, s, friend, pietro, barbo, as, pope, paul, ii, borgia, was, in, high, standing, with, the, new, pope, and, retained, his, positions, including, that, of, vice, chancellor, paul, ii, reversed, some, of, his, predecessor, s, reforms, that, diminished, the, power, of, the, chancellory, following, the, election, borgia, fell, ill, of, the, plague, but, recovered, borgia, had, two, daughters, isabella, 1467, and, girolama, 1469, with, an, unknown, mistress, he, openly, acknowledged, all, three, of, his, children, pope, paul, ii, died, suddenly, in, 1471, while, borgia, had, acquired, the, reputation, and, wealth, to, mount, a, bid, for, the, papacy, in, this, conclave, there, were, only, three, non, italians, making, his, election, a, near, impossibility, consequently, borgia, continued, his, previous, strategy, of, positioning, himself, as, kingmaker, this, time, borgia, gathered, the, votes, to, make, francesco, della, rovere, the, uncle, of, future, borgia, rival, giuliano, della, rovere, pope, sixtus, iv, della, rovere, s, appeal, was, that, he, was, a, pious, and, brilliant, franciscan, friar, who, lacked, many, political, connections, in, rome, he, seemed, to, be, the, perfect, cardinal, to, reform, the, church, and, the, perfect, cardinal, for, borgia, to, maintain, his, influence, sixtus, iv, rewarded, borgia, for, his, support, by, promoting, him, to, cardinal, bishop, and, consecrating, him, as, the, cardinal, bishop, of, albano, requiring, borgia, s, ordination, as, a, priest, borgia, also, received, a, lucrative, abbey, from, the, pope, and, remained, vice, chancellor, at, the, end, of, the, year, the, pope, appointed, borgia, to, be, the, papal, legate, for, spain, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, between, castile, and, aragon, and, to, solicit, their, support, for, another, crusade, in, 1472, borgia, was, appointed, to, be, the, papal, chamberlain, until, his, departure, to, spain, borgia, arrived, in, his, native, aragon, in, the, summer, reuniting, with, family, and, meeting, with, king, juan, ii, and, prince, ferdinand, the, pope, gave, cardinal, borgia, discretion, over, whether, to, give, dispensation, for, ferdinand, s, marriage, to, his, second, cousin, isabella, of, castile, and, borgia, decided, in, favour, of, approving, the, marriage, the, couple, named, borgia, to, be, the, godfather, of, their, first, son, in, recognition, of, this, decision, the, marriage, of, ferdinand, and, isabella, was, critical, in, the, unification, of, castile, and, aragon, into, spain, borgia, also, negotiated, peace, between, castile, and, aragon, and, an, end, to, the, civil, wars, in, the, latter, kingdom, gaining, the, favour, of, the, future, king, ferdinand, who, would, go, on, to, promote, the, interests, of, the, borgia, family, in, aragon, borgia, returned, to, rome, the, following, year, narrowly, surviving, a, storm, that, sank, a, nearby, galley, that, was, carrying, 200, men, of, the, borgia, household, back, in, rome, borgia, began, his, affair, with, vannozza, dei, cattenei, which, would, yield, four, children, cesare, in, 1475, giovanni, in, 1474, or, 1476, lucrezia, in, 1480, and, gioffre, in, 1482, in, 1476, pope, sixtus, appointed, borgia, to, be, the, cardinal, bishop, of, porto, in, 1480, the, pope, legitimized, cesare, as, a, favour, to, cardinal, borgia, and, in, 1482, the, pope, began, to, appoint, the, seven, year, old, to, church, positions, demonstrating, borgia, s, intention, to, use, his, influence, to, promote, his, children, contemporaneously, borgia, continued, to, add, to, his, list, of, benefices, becoming, the, wealthiest, cardinal, by, 1483, he, also, become, dean, of, the, college, of, cardinals, in, that, year, in, 1484, pope, sixtus, iv, died, necessitating, another, election, for, borgia, to, manipulate, to, his, advantage, borgia, was, wealthy, and, powerful, enough, to, mount, a, bid, but, he, faced, competition, from, giuliano, della, rovere, the, late, pope, s, nephew, della, rovere, s, faction, had, the, advantage, of, being, incredibly, large, as, sixtus, had, appointed, many, of, the, cardinals, who, would, participate, in, the, election, borgia, s, attempts, to, gather, enough, votes, included, bribery, and, leveraging, his, close, ties, to, naples, and, aragon, however, many, of, the, spanish, cardinals, were, absent, from, the, conclave, and, della, rovere, s, faction, had, an, overwhelming, advantage, della, rovere, chose, to, promote, cardinal, cibo, as, his, preferred, candidate, and, cibo, wrote, to, the, borgia, faction, wanting, to, strike, a, deal, once, again, borgia, played, kingmaker, and, conceded, to, cardinal, cibo, who, became, pope, innocent, viii, again, borgia, retained, his, position, of, vice, chancellor, successfully, holding, this, position,

wanted, for, his, own, son, in, response, ferdinand, angrily, seized, the, borgia, estates, in, aragon, and, imprisoned, borgia, s, son, pedro, luis, however, borgia, healed, the, relationship, by, turning, down, this, appointment, pope, innocent, at, the, urging, of, his, close, ally, giuliano, della, rovere, decided, to, declare, war, against, naples, but, milan, florence, and, aragon, chose, to, support, naples, over, the, pope, borgia, led, the, opposition, within, the, college, of, cardinals, to, this, war, and, king, ferdinand, rewarded, borgia, by, making, his, son, pedro, luis, the, duke, of, gandia, and, arranging, a, marriage, between, his, cousin, maria, enriquez, and, the, new, duke, now, the, borgia, family, was, directly, tied, to, the, royal, families, of, spain, and, naples, while, borgia, gained, the, favour, of, spain, he, stood, opposed, to, the, pope, and, the, della, rovere, family, as, a, part, of, his, war, opposition, borgia, sought, to, obstruct, an,

giuliano, della, rovere, seen, as, a, pro, french, candidate, it, was, rumoured, but, not, substantiated, that, borgia, succeeded, in, buying, the, largest, number, of, votes, and, sforza, in, particular, was, bribed, with, four, mule, loads, of, silver, mallett, shows, that, borgia, was, in, the, lead, from, the, start, and, that, the, rumours, of, bribery, began, after, the, election, with, the, distribution, of, benefices, sforza, and, della, rovere, were, just, as, willing, and, able, to, bribe, as, anyone, else, the, benefices, and, offices, granted, to, sforza, moreover, would,

and, put, rome, in, a, state, of, defence, but, his, position, was, precarious, when, the, orsini, offered, to, admit, the, french, to, their, castles, alexander, had, no, choice, but, to, come, to,

produced, no, material, results, demonstrated, the, foolishness, of, the, so, called, politics, of, equilibrium, the, medicean, doctrine, of, preventing, one, of, the, italian, principates, from, overwhelming, the, rest, and, uniting, them, under, its, hegemony, charles, viii, s, belligerence, in, italy, had, made, it, transparent, that, the, politics, of, equilibrium, did, nothing, but, render, the, country, unable, to, defend, itself, against, a, powerful, invading, force, italy, was, shown, to, be, very, vulnerable, to, the, predations, of, the, powerful, nation, states, france, and, spain, that, had, forged, themselves, during, the, previous, century, alexander, vi, now, followed, the, general, tendency, of, all, the, princes, of, the, day, to, crush, the, great, feudatories, and, establish, a, centralized, despotism, in, this, manner, he, was, able, to, take, advantage, of, the, defeat, of, the, french, in, order, to, break, the, power, of, the, orsini, from, that, time, on, alexander, was, able, to, build, himself, an, effective, power, base, in, the, papal, states, virginio, orsini, who, had, been, captured, by, the, spanish, died, a, prisoner, at, naples, and, the, pope, confiscated, his, property, the, rest, of, the, orsini, clan, still, held, out, defeating, the, papal, troops, sent, against, them, under, guidobaldo, da, montefeltro, duke, of, urbino, and, giovanni, borgia, duke, of, gandia, at, soriano, january, 1497, peace, was, made, through, venetian, mediation, the, orsini, paying, 50, 000, ducats, in, exchange, for, their, confiscated, lands, the, duke, of, urbino, whom, they, had, captured, was, left, by, the, pope, to, pay, his, own, ransom, the, orsini, remained, very, powerful, and, pope, alexander, vi, could, count, on, none, but, his, 3, 000, spanish, troops, his, only, success, had, been, the, capture, of, ostia, and, the, submission, of, the, francophile, cardinals, colonna, and, savelli, then, occurred, a, major, domestic, tragedy, for, the, house, of, borgia, on, 14, june, his, son, the, duke, of, gandia, who, was, lately, created, duke, of, benevento, and, had, a, questionable, lifestyle, disappeared, the, next, day, his, corpse, was, found, in, the, tiber, alexander, overwhelmed, with, grief, shut, himself, up, in, castel, sant, angelo, he, declared, that, henceforth, the, moral, reform, of, the, church, would, be, the, sole, object, of, his, life, every, effort, was, made, to, discover, the, assassin, no, conclusive, explanation, was, ever, reached, and, it, may, be, that, the, crime, was, simply, as, a, result, of, one, of, the, duke, s, sexual, liaisons, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, borgias, resorted, to, poisoning, judicial, murder, or, extortion, to, fund, their, schemes, and, the, defense, of, the, papal, states, the, only, contemporary, accusations, of, poisoning, were, from, some, of, their, servants, extracted, under, torture, by, alexander, s, bitter, enemy, della, rovere, who, succeeded, him, as, pope, julius, ii, the, debased, state, of, the, curia, was, a, major, scandal, opponents, such, as, the, powerful, florentine, friar, girolamo, savonarola, launched, invectives, against, papal, corruption, and, appealed, for, a, general, council, to, confront, the, papal, abuses, alexander, is, reported, to, have, been, reduced, to, laughter, when, savonarola, s, denunciations, were, related, to, him, nevertheless, he, appointed, sebastian, maggi, to, investigate, the, friar, and, he, responded, on, 16, october, 1495, we, are, displeased, at, the, disturbed, state, of, affairs, in, florence, the, more, so, in, that, it, owes, its, origin, to, your, preaching, for, you, predict, the, future, and, publicly, declare, that, you, do, so, by, the, inspiration, of, the, holy, spirit, when, you, should, be, reprehending, vice, and, praising, virtue, prophecies, like, these, should, not, be, made, when, your, charge, is, to, forward, peace, and, concord, moreover, these, are, not, the, time, for, such, teachings, calculated, as, they, are, to, produce, discord, even, in, times, of, peace, let, alone, in, times, of, trouble, since, however, we, have, been, most, happy, to, learn, from, certain, cardinals, and, from, your, letter, that, you, are, ready, to, submit, yourself, to, the, reproofs, of, the, church, as, becomes, a, christian, and, a, religious, we, are, beginning, to, think, that, what, you, have, done, has, not, been, done, with, an, evil, motive, but, from, a, certain, simple, mindedness, and, a, zeal, however, misguided, for, the, lord, s, vineyard, our, duty, however, prescribes, that, we, order, you, under, holy, obedience, to, cease, from, public, and, private, preaching, until, you, are, able, to, come, to, our, presence, not, under, armed, escort, as, is, your, present, habit, but, safely, quietly, and, modestly, as, becomes, a, religious, or, until, we, make, different, arrangements, if, you, obey, as, we, hope, you, will, we, for, the, time, being, suspend, the, operation, of, our, former, brief, so, that, you, may, live, in, peace, in, accordance, with, the, dictates, of, your, conscience, the, hostility, of, savonarola, seems, to, have, been, political, rather, than, personal, and, the, friar, sent, a, letter, of, condolence, to, the, pope, on, the, death, of, the, duke, of, gandia, faith, most, holy, father, is, the, one, and, true, source, of, peace, and, consolation, faith, alone, brings, consolation, from, a, far, off, country, but, eventually, the, florentines, tired, of, the, friar, s, moralising, and, the, florentine, government, condemned, the, reformer, to, death, executing, him, on, 23, may, 1498, the, prominent, italian, families, looked, down, on, the, spanish, borgia, family, and, they, resented, their, power, which, they, sought, for, themselves, this, is, at, least, partially, why, both, pope, callixtus, iii, and, pope, alexander, vi, gave, powers, to, family, members, whom, they, could, trust, in, these, circumstances, alexander, feeling, more, than, ever, that, he, could, rely, only, on, his, own, kin, turned, his, thoughts, to, further, family, aggrandizement, he, had, annulled, lucrezia, s, marriage, to, giovanni, sforza, who, had, responded, to, the, suggestion, that, he, was, impotent, with, the, unsubstantiated, counterclaim, that, alexander, and, cesare, indulged, in, incestuous, relations, with, lucrezia, in, 1497, unable, to, arrange, a, union, between, cesare, and, the, daughter, of, king, frederick, iv, of, naples, who, had, succeeded, ferdinand, ii, the, previous, year, he, induced, frederick, by, threats, to, agree, to, a, marriage, between, the, duke, of, bisceglie, a, natural, son, of, alfonso, ii, and, lucrezia, alexander, and, the, new, french, king, louis, xii, entered, a, secret, agreement, in, exchange, for, a, bull, of, divorce, between, the, king, and, joan, of, france, so, he, could, marry, anne, of, brittany, and, making, georges, d, amboise, the, king, s, chief, advisor, the, cardinal, of, rouen, cesare, was, given, the, duchy, of, valentinois, in, france, chosen, because, it, was, homophonous, with, his, nickname, valentino, derived, from, his, father, s, papal, epithet, valentinus, the, valencian, as, seen, on, his, coins, denoting, his, origin, in, the, kingdom, of, valencia, spain, military, assistance, to, help, him, subjugate, the, feudal, princelings, of, papal, romagna, and, a, princess, bride, charlotte, of, albret, from, the, kingdom, of, navarre, alexander, hoped, that, louis, xii, s, help, would, be, more, profitable, to, his, house, than, that, of, charles, viii, had, been, in, spite, of, the, remonstrances, of, spain, and, of, the, sforza, he, allied, himself, with, france, in, january, 1499, and, was, joined, by, venice, by, autumn, louis, xii, was, in, italy, expelling, lodovico, sforza, from, milan, with, french, success, seemingly, assured, the, pope, determined, to, deal, drastically, with, romagna, which, although, nominally, under, papal, rule, was, divided, into, a, number, of, practically, independent, lordships, on, which, venice, milan, and, florence, cast, hungry, eyes, cesare, empowered, by, the, support, of, the, french, began, to, attack, the, turbulent, cities, one, by, one, in, his, capacity, as, nominated, gonfaloniere, standard, bearer, of, the, church, but, the, expulsion, of, the, french, from, milan, and, the, return, of, lodovico, sforza, interrupted, his, conquests, and, he, returned, to, rome, early, in, 1500, in, the, jubilee, year, 1500, alexander, ushered, in, the, custom, of, opening, a, holy, door, on, christmas, eve, and, closing, it, on, christmas, day, the, following, year, after, consulting, with, his, master, of, ceremonies, johann, burchard, pope, alexander, vi, opened, the, first, holy, door, in, st, peter, s, basilica, on, christmas, eve, 1499, and, papal, representatives, opened, the, doors, in, the, other, three, patriarchal, basilicas, for, this, pope, alexander, had, a, new, opening, created, in, the, portico, of, st, peter, s, and, commissioned, a, marble, door, alexander, was, carried, in, the, sedia, gestatoria, to, st, peter, s, he, and, his, assistants, bearing, candles, processed, to, the, holy, door, as, the, choir, chanted, psalm, 118, 19, 20, the, pope, knocked, on, the, door, three, times, workers, moved, it, from, the, inside, and, everyone, then, crossed, the, threshold, to, enter, into, a, period, of, penance, and, reconciliation, thus, pope, alexander, formalized, the, rite, and, began, a, longstanding, tradition, that, is, still, in, practice, similar, ceremonies, were, held, at, the, other, three, basilicas, alexander, instituted, a, special, rite, for, the, closing, of, a, holy, door, as, well, on, the, feast, of, the, epiphany, in, 1501, two, cardinals, began, to, seal, the, holy, door, with, two, bricks, one, silver, and, one, gold, sampietrini, basilica, workers, completed, the, seal, placing, specially, minted, coins, and, medals, inside, the, wall, of, alexander, s, many, mistresses, one, of, his, favourites, was, vannozza, dei, cattanei, born, in, 1442, and, who, was, married, to, three, different, men, the, relationship, began, in, 1470, and, she, had, four, children, whom, the, pope, openly, acknowledged, as, his, own, cesare, born, 1475, giovanni, afterwards, duke, of, gandia, commonly, known, as, juan, born, 1474, or, 1476, lucrezia, born, 1480, and, gioffre, goffredo, in, italian, born, 1481, or, 1482, rodrigo, only, legitimized, his, children, after, becoming, pope, he, had, pretended, that, his, four, children, with, vannozza, were, his, niece, and, nephews, and, that, they, were, fathered, by, vannozza, s, husbands, g, j, meyer, argued, that, the, birth, dates, of, the, four, children, in, comparison, with, alexander, s, known, whereabouts, preclude, him, from, having, fathered, any, of, them, his, acknowledgement, merely, consisted, of, addressing, them, as, beloved, son, daughter, in, correspondence, while, applying, the, same, address, to, e, g, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, isabella, i, of, castile, in, the, same, letter, another, mistress, was, the, beautiful, giulia, farnese, giulia, la, bella, wife, of, orsino, orsini, giulia, was, mother, of, laura, orsini, born, in, 1492, probably, daughter, of, alexander, however, he, still, loved, vannozza, and, his, children, by, her, caring, for, them, proved, the, determining, factor, of, his, whole, career, he, lavished, vast, sums, on, them, vannozza, lived, in, the, palace, of, a, late, cardinal, or, in, a, large, palatial, villa, the, children, lived, between, their, mother, s, home, and, the, papal, palace, itself, six, other, children, girolama, isabella, pedro, luiz, giovanni, the, infans, romanus, rodrigo, and, bernardo, were, of, uncertain, maternal, parentage, his, daughter, isabella, was, the, great, great, grandmother, of, pope, innocent, x, who, was, therefore, descended, in, a, direct, line, from, alexander, while, the, explorers, of, spain, imposed, a, form, of, slavery, called, encomienda, on, the, indigenous, peoples, they, met, in, the, new, world, some, popes, had, spoken, out, against, the, practice, of, slavery, in, 1435, pope, eugene, iv, had, issued, an, attack, on, slavery, in, the, canary, islands, in, his, papal, bull, sicut, dudum, which, included, the, excommunication, of, all, those, who, engaged, in, the, slave, trade, with, native, chiefs, there, a, form, of, indentured, servitude, was, allowed, being, similar, to, a, peasant, s, duty, to, his, liege, lord, in, europe, in, the, wake, of, columbus, s, landing, in, the, new, world, pope, alexander, was, asked, by, the, spanish, monarchy, to, confirm, their, ownership, of, these, newly, found, lands, the, bulls, issued, by, pope, alexander, vi, eximiae, devotionis, 3, may, 1493, inter, caetera, 4, may, 1493, and, dudum, siquidem, 23, september, 1493, granted, rights, to, spain, with, respect, to, the, newly, discovered, lands, in, the, americas, similar, to, those, pope, nicholas, v, had, previously, conferred, on, portugal, with, the, bulls, romanus, pontifex, and, dum, diversas, morales, padron, 1979, concludes, that, these, bulls, gave, power, to, enslave, the, natives, minnich, 2010, asserts, that, this, slave, trade, was, permitted, to, facilitate, conversions, to, christianity, other, historians, and, vatican, scholars, strongly, disagree, with, these, accusations, and, assert, that, alexander, never, gave, his, approval, to, the, practice, of, slavery, other, later, popes, such, as, pope, paul, iii, in, sublimis, deus, 1537, pope, benedict, xiv, in, immensa, pastorium, 1741, and, pope, gregory, xvi, in, his, letter, in, supremo, apostolatus, 1839, continued, to, condemn, slavery, thornberry, 2002, asserts, that, inter, caetera, was, applied, in, the, spanish, requirement, of, 1513, which, was, read, to, american, indians, who, could, not, understand, the, colonisers, language, before, hostilities, against, them, began, they, were, given, the, option, to, accept, the, authority, of, the, pope, and, spanish, crown, or, face, being, attacked, and, subjugated, in, 1993, the, indigenous, law, institute, called, on, pope, john, paul, ii, to, revoke, inter, caetera, and, to, make, reparation, for, this, unreasonable, historical, grief, this, was, followed, by, a, similar, appeal, in, 1994, by, the, parliament, of, world, religions, a, danger, now, arose, in, the, shape, of, a, conspiracy, by, the, deposed, despots, the, orsini, and, of, some, of, cesare, s, own, condottieri, at, first, the, papal, troops, were, defeated, and, things, looked, bleak, for, the, house, of, borgia, but, a, promise, of, french, help, quickly, forced, the, confederates, to, come, to, terms, cesare, by, an, act, of, treachery, then, seized, the, ringleaders, at, senigallia, and, put, oliverotto, da, fermo, and, vitellozzo, vitelli, to, death, 31, december, 1502, when, alexander, vi, heard, the, news, he, lured, cardinal, orsini, to, the, vatican, and, cast, him, into, a, dungeon, where, he, died, his, goods, were, confiscated, and, many, other, members, of, the, clan, in, rome, were, arrested, while, alexander, s, son, goffredo, borgia, led, an, expedition, into, the, campagna, and, seized, their, castles, thus, the, two, great, houses, of, orsini, and, colonna, who, had, long, fought, for, predominance, in, rome, and, often, flouted, the, pope, s, authority, were, subjugated, and, the, borgias, power, increased, cesare, then, returned, to, rome, where, his, father, asked, him, to, assist, goffredo, in, reducing, the, last, orsini, strongholds, this, he, was, unwilling, to, do, much, to, his, father, s, annoyance, but, he, eventually, marched, out, captured, ceri, and, made, peace, with, giulio, orsini, who, surrendered, bracciano, the, war, between, france, and, spain, for, the, possession, of, naples, dragged, on, and, the, pope, was, forever, intriguing, ready, to, ally, himself, with, whichever, power, promised, the, most, advantageous, terms, at, any, moment, he, offered, to, help, louis, xii, on, condition, that, sicily, be, given, to, cesare, and, then, offered, to, help, spain, in, exchange, for, siena, pisa, and, bologna, cesare, was, preparing, for, another, expedition, in, august, 1503, when, after, he, and, his, father, had, dined, with, cardinal, adriano, castellesi, on, 6, august, they, were, taken, ill, with, fever, a, few, days, later, cesare, who, lay, in, bed, his, skin, peeling, and, his, face, suffused, to, a, violet, colour, as, a, consequence, of, certain, drastic, measures, to, save, him, eventually, recovered, but, the, aged, pontiff, apparently, had, little, chance, burchard, s, diary, provides, a, few, details, of, the, pope, s, final, illness, and, death, at, age, 72, saturday, 12, august, 1503, the, pope, fell, ill, in, the, morning, after, the, hour, of, vespers, between, six, and, seven, o, clock, a, fever, appeared, and, remained, permanently, on, 15, august, thirteen, ounces, of, blood, were, drawn, from, him, and, the, tertian, ague, supervened, on, thursday, 17, august, at, nine, o, clock, in, the, forenoon, he, took, medicine, on, friday, the, 18th, between, nine, and, ten, o, clock, he, confessed, to, the, bishop, gamboa, of, carignola, who, then, read, mass, to, him, after, his, communion, he, gave, the, eucharist, to, the, pope, who, was, sitting, in, bed, then, he, ended, the, mass, at, which, were, present, five, cardinals, serra, juan, and, francesco, borgia, casanova, and, loris, the, pope, told, them, that, he, felt, very, bad, at, the, hour, of, vespers, after, gamboa, had, given, him, extreme, unction, he, died, as, for, his, true, faults, known, only, to, his, confessor, pope, alexander, vi, apparently, died, genuinely, repentant, the, bishop, of, gallipoli, alexis, celadoni, spoke, of, the, pontiff, s, contrition, during, his, funeral, oration, to, the, electors, of, alexander, s, successor, pope, pius, iii, when, at, last, the, pope, was, suffering, from, a, very, severe, sickness, he, spontaneously, requested, one, after, another, each, of, the, last, sacraments, he, first, made, a, very, careful, confession, of, his, sins, with, a, contrite, heart, and, was, affected, even, to, the, shedding, of, tears, i, am, told, then, he, received, in, communion, the, most, sacred, body, and, extreme, unction, was, administered, to, him, the, interregnum, witnessed, again, the, ancient, tradition, of, violence, and, rioting, cesare, too, ill, to, attend, to, the, business, himself, sent, don, micheletto, his, chief, bravo, to, seize, the, pope, s, treasures, before, the, death, was, publicly, announced, the, next, day, the, body, was, exhibited, to, the, people, and, clergy, of, rome, but, was, covered, by, an, old, tapestry, antiquo, tapete, having, become, greatly, disfigured, by, rapid, decomposition, according, to, raphael, volterrano, it, was, a, revolting, scene, to, look, at, that, deformed, blackened, corpse, prodigiously, swelled, and, exhaling, an, infectious, smell, his, lips, and, nose, were, covered, with, brown, drivel, his, mouth, was, opened, very, widely, and, his, tongue, inflated, by, poison, therefore, no, fanatic, or, devotee, dared, to, kiss, his, feet, or, hands, as, custom, would, have, required, the, venetian, ambassador, stated, that, the, body, was, the, ugliest, most, monstrous, and, horrible, dead, body, that, was, ever, seen, without, any, form, or, likeness, of, humanity, ludwig, von, pastor, insists, that, the, decomposition, was, perfectly, natural, owing, to, the, summer, heat, commentaries, attribute, the, pope, s, death, to, malaria, then, prevalent, in, rome, or, to, another, such, pestilence, one, contemporary, official, wrote, home, that, there, was, little, surprise, that, alexander, and, cesare, had, both, fallen, ill, as, the, bad, air, had, led, to, many, in, rome, and, especially, in, the, roman, curia, becoming, sick, after, a, short, stay, the, body, was, removed, from, the, crypts, of, st, peter, s, and, installed, in, the, less, well, known, spanish, national, church, of, santa, maria, in, monserrato, degli, spagnoli, following, the, death, of, alexander, vi, his, rival, and, successor, julius, ii, said, on, the, day, of, his, election, i, will, not, live, in, the, same, rooms, as, the, borgias, lived, he, desecrated, the, holy, church, as, none, before, the, borgia, apartments, remained, sealed, until, the, 19th, century, catholic, apologists, of, alexander, vi, have, argued, that, the, behaviors, he, receives, criticism, for, were, not, atypical, of, the, period, de, maistre, in, his, work, du, pape, the, latter, are, forgiven, nothing, because, everything, is, expected, from, them, wherefore, the, vices, lightly, passed, over, in, a, louis, xiv, become, most, offensive, and, scandalous, in, an, alexander, vi, alexander, vi, had, sought, reforms, of, the, increasingly, irresponsible, curia, putting, together, a, group, of, his, most, pious, cardinals, in, order, to, move, the, process, along, the, planned, reforms, included, new, rules, on, the, sale, of, church, property, the, limiting, of, cardinals, to, one, diocese, and, stricter, moral, codes, for, clergy, though, these, were, not, implemented, alexander, vi, was, known, for, his, patronage, of, the, arts, and, in, his, days, a, new, architectural, era, was, initiated, in, rome, with, the, coming, of, bramante, raphael, michelangelo, and, pinturicchio, all, worked, for, him, he, commissioned, pinturicchio, to, lavishly, paint, a, suite, of, rooms, in, the, apostolic, palace, in, the, vatican, which, are, today, known, as, the, borgia, apartments, he, took, a, great, interest, in, theatrics, and, he, even, had, plautus, s, menaechmi, performed, in, his, apartments, in, addition, to, the, arts, alexander, vi, also, encouraged, the, development, of, education, in, 1495, he, issued, a, papal, bull, at, the, request, of, william, elphinstone, bishop, of, aberdeen, and, james, iv, of, scotland, founding, king, s, college, aberdeen, king, s, college, now, forms, an, integral, element, of, the, university, of, aberdeen, alexander, vi, also, in, 1501, approved, the, university, of, valencia, alexander, vi, whom, papal, rival, and, successor, giuliano, della, rovere, alleged, without, evidence, was, a, marrano, demonstrated, relatively, benign, treatment, of, jews, after, the, 1492, expulsion, of, the, jews, from, spain, some, 9, 000, impoverished, iberian, jews, arrived, at, the, borders, of, the, papal, states, alexander, welcomed, them, into, rome, declaring, that, they, were, permitted, to, lead, their, life, free, from, interference, from, christians, to, continue, in, their, own, rites, to, gain, wealth, and, to, enjoy, many, other, privileges, he, similarly, allowed, the, immigration, of, jews, expelled, from, portugal, in, 1497, and, from, provence, in, 1498, bohuslav, hasi, tejnsk, z, lobkovic, a, bohemian, humanist, poet, 1461, 1510, wrote, a, hostile, epitaph, on, alexander, in, latin, epitaphium,
