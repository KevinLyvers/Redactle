milton, friedman, f, r, i, d, m, n, july, 31, 1912, november, 16, 2006, was, an, american, economist, and, statistician, who, received, the, 1976, nobel, memorial, prize, in, economic, sciences, for, his, research, on, consumption, analysis, monetary, history, and, theory, and, the, complexity, of, stabilization, policy, with, george, stigler, friedman, was, among, the, intellectual, leaders, of, the, chicago, school, of, economics, a, neoclassical, school, of, economic, thought, associated, with, the, work, of, the, faculty, at, the, university, of, chicago, that, rejected, keynesianism, in, favor, of, monetarism, until, the, mid, 1970s, when, it, turned, to, new, classical, macroeconomics, heavily, based, on, the, concept, of, rational, expectations, several, students, young, professors, and, academics, who, were, recruited, or, mentored, by, friedman, at, chicago, went, on, to, become, leading, economists, including, gary, becker, robert, fogel, and, robert, lucas, jr, friedman, s, challenges, to, what, he, called, naive, keynesian, theory, began, with, his, interpretation, of, consumption, which, tracks, how, consumers, spend, he, introduced, a, theory, which, would, later, become, part, of, mainstream, economics, and, he, was, among, the, first, to, propagate, the, theory, of, consumption, smoothing, during, the, 1960s, he, became, the, main, advocate, opposing, keynesian, government, policies, and, described, his, approach, along, with, mainstream, economics, as, using, keynesian, language, and, apparatus, yet, rejecting, its, initial, conclusions, he, theorized, that, there, existed, a, natural, rate, of, unemployment, and, argued, that, unemployment, below, this, rate, would, cause, inflation, to, accelerate, he, argued, that, the, phillips, curve, was, in, the, long, run, vertical, at, the, natural, rate, and, predicted, what, would, come, to, be, known, as, stagflation, friedman, promoted, a, macroeconomic, viewpoint, known, as, monetarism, and, argued, that, a, steady, small, expansion, of, the, money, supply, was, the, preferred, policy, as, compared, to, rapid, and, unexpected, changes, his, ideas, concerning, monetary, policy, taxation, privatization, and, deregulation, influenced, government, policies, especially, during, the, 1980s, his, monetary, theory, influenced, the, federal, reserve, s, monetary, policy, in, response, to, the, global, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, after, retiring, from, the, university, of, chicago, in, 1977, and, becoming, emeritus, professor, in, economics, in, 1983, friedman, served, as, an, advisor, to, republican, u, s, president, ronald, reagan, and, conservative, british, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, his, political, philosophy, extolled, the, virtues, of, a, free, market, economic, system, with, minimal, government, intervention, in, social, matters, in, his, 1962, book, capitalism, and, freedom, friedman, advocated, policies, such, as, a, volunteer, military, freely, floating, exchange, rates, abolition, of, medical, licenses, a, negative, income, tax, school, vouchers, and, opposition, to, the, war, on, drugs, and, support, for, drug, liberalization, policies, his, support, for, school, choice, led, him, to, found, the, friedman, foundation, for, educational, choice, later, renamed, edchoice, friedman, s, works, cover, a, broad, range, of, economic, topics, and, public, policy, issues, his, books, and, essays, have, had, global, influence, including, in, former, communist, states, a, 2011, survey, of, economists, commissioned, by, the, ejw, ranked, friedman, as, the, second, most, popular, economist, of, the, 20th, century, following, only, john, maynard, keynes, upon, his, death, the, economist, described, him, as, the, most, influential, economist, of, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, possibly, of, all, of, it, friedman, was, born, in, brooklyn, new, york, city, on, july, 31, 1912, his, parents, s, ra, ethel, n, e, landau, and, jen, saul, friedman, were, jewish, working, class, immigrants, from, beregsz, sz, in, carpathian, ruthenia, kingdom, of, hungary, now, berehove, in, ukraine, they, emigrated, to, america, in, their, early, teens, they, both, worked, as, dry, goods, merchants, friedman, was, their, fourth, child, and, only, son, as, well, as, the, youngest, of, the, children, shortly, after, his, birth, the, family, relocated, to, rahway, new, jersey, friedman, s, father, jen, saul, friedman, died, during, friedman, s, senior, year, of, high, school, leaving, friedman, and, two, older, sisters, to, care, for, their, mother, in, his, early, teens, friedman, was, injured, in, a, car, accident, which, scarred, his, upper, lip, a, talented, student, and, an, avid, reader, friedman, graduated, from, rahway, high, school, in, 1928, just, before, his, 16th, birthday, he, was, the, first, in, his, family, to, attend, a, university, friedman, was, awarded, a, competitive, scholarship, to, rutgers, university, and, graduated, in, 1932, friedman, initially, intended, to, become, an, actuary, or, mathematician, however, the, state, of, the, economy, which, was, at, this, point, in, a, depression, convinced, him, to, become, an, economist, he, was, offered, two, scholarships, to, do, graduate, work, one, in, mathematics, at, brown, university, and, the, other, in, economics, at, the, university, of, chicago, friedman, chose, the, latter, earning, a, master, of, arts, degree, in, 1933, he, was, strongly, influenced, by, jacob, viner, frank, knight, and, henry, simons, friedman, met, his, future, wife, economist, rose, director, while, at, the, university, of, chicago, friedman, was, also, the, student, of, friedrich, hayek, during, the, 1933, 1934, academic, year, he, had, a, fellowship, at, columbia, university, where, he, studied, statistics, with, statistician, and, economist, harold, hotelling, he, was, back, in, chicago, for, the, 1934, 1935, academic, year, working, as, a, research, assistant, for, henry, schultz, who, was, then, working, on, theory, and, measurement, of, demand, during, the, 1934, 1935, academic, year, friedman, formed, what, would, later, prove, to, be, lifetime, friendships, with, george, stigler, and, w, allen, wallis, both, of, whom, later, taught, with, friedman, at, the, university, of, chicago, friedman, was, also, influenced, by, two, lifelong, friends, arthur, burns, and, homer, johnson, they, helped, friedman, better, understand, the, depth, of, economic, thinking, friedman, was, unable, to, find, academic, employment, so, in, 1935, he, followed, his, friend, w, allen, wallis, to, washington, d, c, where, franklin, d, roosevelt, s, new, deal, was, a, lifesaver, for, many, young, economists, at, this, stage, friedman, said, he, and, his, wife, regarded, the, job, creation, programs, such, as, the, wpa, ccc, and, pwa, appropriate, responses, to, the, critical, situation, but, not, the, price, and, wage, fixing, measures, of, the, national, recovery, administration, and, the, agricultural, adjustment, administration, foreshadowing, his, later, ideas, he, believed, price, controls, interfered, with, an, essential, signaling, mechanism, to, help, resources, be, used, where, they, were, most, valued, indeed, friedman, later, concluded, that, all, government, intervention, associated, with, the, new, deal, was, the, wrong, cure, for, the, wrong, disease, arguing, the, federal, reserve, was, to, blame, and, that, they, should, have, expanded, the, money, supply, in, reaction, to, what, he, later, described, in, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, as, the, great, contraction, later, friedman, and, his, colleague, anna, schwartz, wrote, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, 1867, 1960, which, argued, that, the, great, depression, was, caused, by, a, severe, monetary, contraction, due, to, banking, crises, and, poor, policy, on, the, part, of, the, federal, reserve, robert, j, shiller, describes, the, book, as, the, most, influential, account, of, the, great, depression, during, 1935, he, began, working, for, the, national, resources, planning, board, which, was, then, working, on, a, large, consumer, budget, survey, ideas, from, this, project, later, became, a, part, of, his, theory, of, the, consumption, function, a, book, which, first, described, consumption, smoothing, and, the, permanent, income, hypothesis, friedman, began, employment, with, the, national, bureau, of, economic, research, during, the, autumn, of, 1937, to, assist, simon, kuznets, in, his, work, on, professional, income, this, work, resulted, in, their, jointly, authored, publication, incomes, from, independent, professional, practice, which, introduced, the, concepts, of, permanent, and, transitory, income, a, major, component, of, the, permanent, income, hypothesis, that, friedman, worked, out, in, greater, detail, in, the, 1950s, the, book, hypothesizes, that, professional, licensing, artificially, restricts, the, supply, of, services, and, raises, prices, incomes, from, independent, professional, practice, remained, quite, controversial, within, the, economics, community, because, of, friedman, s, hypothesis, that, barriers, to, entry, which, were, exercised, and, enforced, by, the, american, medical, association, led, to, higher, than, average, wages, for, physicians, compared, to, other, professional, groups, barriers, to, entry, are, a, fixed, cost, which, must, be, incurred, regardless, of, any, outside, factors, such, as, work, experience, or, other, factors, of, human, capital, during, 1940, friedman, was, appointed, as, an, assistant, professor, teaching, economics, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, but, encountered, anti, semitism, in, the, economics, department, and, returned, to, government, service, from, 1941, to, 1943, friedman, worked, on, wartime, tax, policy, for, the, federal, government, as, an, advisor, to, senior, officials, of, the, united, states, department, of, the, treasury, as, a, treasury, spokesman, during, 1942, he, advocated, a, keynesian, policy, of, taxation, he, helped, to, invent, the, payroll, withholding, tax, system, since, the, federal, government, needed, money, to, fund, the, war, he, later, said, i, have, no, apologies, for, it, but, i, really, wish, we, hadn, t, found, it, necessary, and, i, wish, there, were, some, way, of, abolishing, withholding, now, in, milton, and, rose, friedman, s, jointly, written, memoir, he, wrote, rose, has, repeatedly, chided, me, over, the, years, about, the, role, that, i, played, in, making, possible, the, current, overgrown, government, we, both, criticize, so, strongly, in, 1940, friedman, accepted, a, position, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, but, left, because, of, differences, with, faculty, regarding, united, states, involvement, in, world, war, ii, friedman, believed, the, united, states, should, enter, the, war, in, 1943, friedman, joined, the, division, of, war, research, at, columbia, university, headed, by, w, allen, wallis, and, harold, hotelling, where, he, spent, the, rest, of, world, war, ii, working, as, a, mathematical, statistician, focusing, on, problems, of, weapons, design, military, tactics, and, metallurgical, experiments, in, 1945, friedman, submitted, incomes, from, independent, professional, practice, co, authored, with, kuznets, and, completed, during, 1940, to, columbia, as, his, doctoral, dissertation, the, university, awarded, him, a, phd, in, 1946, friedman, spent, the, 1945, 1946, academic, year, teaching, at, the, university, of, minnesota, where, his, friend, george, stigler, was, employed, on, february, 12, 1945, his, only, son, david, d, friedman, who, would, later, follow, in, his, father, s, footsteps, as, an, economist, was, born, in, 1946, friedman, accepted, an, offer, to, teach, economic, theory, at, the, university, of, chicago, a, position, opened, by, departure, of, his, former, professor, jacob, viner, to, princeton, university, friedman, would, work, for, the, university, of, chicago, for, the, next, 30, years, there, he, contributed, to, the, establishment, of, an, intellectual, community, that, produced, a, number, of, nobel, memorial, prize, winners, known, collectively, as, the, chicago, school, of, economics, at, the, time, arthur, f, burns, who, was, then, the, head, of, the, national, bureau, of, economic, research, and, later, chairman, of, the, federal, reserve, asked, friedman, to, rejoin, the, bureau, s, staff, he, accepted, the, invitation, and, assumed, responsibility, for, the, bureau, s, inquiry, into, the, role, of, money, in, the, business, cycle, as, a, result, he, initiated, the, workshop, in, money, and, banking, the, chicago, workshop, which, promoted, a, revival, of, monetary, studies, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 1940s, friedman, began, a, collaboration, with, anna, schwartz, an, economic, historian, at, the, bureau, that, would, ultimately, result, in, the, 1963, publication, of, a, book, co, authored, by, friedman, and, schwartz, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, 1867, 1960, in, 1951, friedman, was, awarded, the, john, bates, clark, medal, which, at, the, time, was, awarded, every, other, year, to, the, best, economist, under, the, age, of, 40, by, the, american, economic, association, remarkably, his, most, influential, work, was, still, ahead, of, him, friedman, spent, the, 1954, 1955, academic, year, as, a, fulbright, visiting, fellow, at, gonville, and, caius, college, cambridge, at, the, time, the, cambridge, economics, faculty, was, divided, into, a, keynesian, majority, including, joan, robinson, and, richard, kahn, and, an, anti, keynesian, minority, headed, by, dennis, robertson, friedman, speculated, he, was, invited, to, the, fellowship, because, his, views, were, unacceptable, to, both, of, the, cambridge, factions, later, his, weekly, columns, for, newsweek, magazine, 1966, 84, were, well, read, and, increasingly, influential, among, political, and, business, people, and, helped, earn, the, magazine, a, gerald, loeb, special, award, in, 1968, from, 1968, to, 1978, he, and, paul, samuelson, participated, in, the, economics, cassette, series, a, biweekly, subscription, series, where, the, economist, would, discuss, the, days, issues, for, about, a, half, hour, at, a, time, one, of, milton, friedman, s, most, popular, works, a, theory, of, the, consumption, function, challenged, traditional, keynesian, viewpoints, about, the, household, this, work, was, originally, published, in, 1957, by, princeton, university, press, and, it, reanalyzed, the, relationship, displayed, between, aggregate, consumption, or, aggregate, savings, and, aggregate, income, friedman, s, counterpart, keynes, believed, people, would, modify, their, household, consumption, expenditures, to, relate, to, their, existing, income, levels, friedman, s, research, introduced, the, term, permanent, income, to, the, world, which, was, the, average, of, a, household, s, expected, income, over, several, years, and, he, also, developed, the, permanent, income, hypothesis, friedman, thought, income, consisted, of, several, components, namely, transitory, and, permanent, he, established, the, formula, y, y, p, y, t, displaystyle, y, y, p, y, t, to, calculate, income, with, p, representing, the, permanent, component, and, t, representing, the, transitory, component, milton, friedman, s, research, changed, how, economists, interpreted, the, consumption, function, and, his, work, pushed, the, idea, that, current, income, was, not, the, only, factor, affecting, people, s, adjustment, household, consumption, expenditures, instead, expected, income, levels, also, affected, how, households, would, change, their, consumption, expenditures, friedman, s, contributions, strongly, influenced, research, on, consumer, behavior, and, he, further, defined, how, to, predict, consumption, smoothing, which, contradicts, keynes, marginal, propensity, to, consume, although, this, work, presented, many, controversial, points, of, view, which, differed, from, existing, viewpoints, established, by, keynes, a, theory, of, the, consumption, function, helped, friedman, gain, respect, in, the, field, of, economics, his, work, on, the, permanent, income, hypothesis, is, among, the, many, contributions, which, were, listed, as, reasons, for, his, sveriges, riksbank, prize, in, economic, sciences, his, work, was, later, expanded, on, by, christopher, d, carroll, especially, in, regards, to, the, absence, of, liquidity, constraints, the, permanent, income, hypothesis, faces, some, criticism, mainly, from, keynesian, economists, the, primary, criticism, of, the, hypothesis, is, based, on, a, lack, of, liquidity, constraints, his, book, capitalism, and, freedom, inspired, by, a, series, of, lectures, he, gave, at, wabash, college, brought, him, national, and, international, attention, outside, academia, it, was, published, in, 1962, by, the, university, of, chicago, press, and, consists, of, essays, that, used, non, mathematical, economic, models, to, explore, issues, of, public, policy, it, sold, over, 400, 000, copies, in, the, first, eighteen, years, and, more, than, half, a, million, since, 1962, capitalism, and, freedom, was, translated, into, eighteen, languages, friedman, talks, about, the, need, to, move, to, a, classically, liberal, society, that, free, markets, would, help, nations, and, individuals, in, the, long, run, and, fix, the, efficiency, problems, currently, faced, by, the, united, states, and, other, major, countries, of, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, he, goes, through, the, chapters, specifying, an, issue, in, each, respective, chapter, from, the, role, of, government, and, money, supply, to, social, welfare, programs, to, a, special, chapter, on, occupational, licensure, friedman, concludes, capitalism, and, freedom, with, his, classical, liberal, stance, that, government, should, stay, out, of, matters, that, do, not, need, it, and, should, only, involve, itself, when, absolutely, necessary, for, the, survival, of, its, people, and, the, country, he, recounts, how, the, best, of, a, country, s, abilities, come, from, its, free, markets, while, its, failures, come, from, government, intervention, in, 1977, at, the, age, of, 65, friedman, retired, from, the, university, of, chicago, after, teaching, there, for, 30, years, he, and, his, wife, moved, to, san, francisco, where, he, became, a, visiting, scholar, at, the, federal, reserve, bank, of, san, francisco, from, 1977, on, he, was, affiliated, with, the, hoover, institution, at, stanford, university, during, 1977, friedman, was, approached, by, bob, chitester, and, the, free, to, choose, network, they, asked, him, to, create, a, television, program, presenting, his, economic, and, social, philosophy, friedman, and, his, wife, rose, worked, on, this, project, for, the, next, three, years, and, during, 1980, the, ten, part, series, titled, free, to, choose, was, broadcast, by, the, public, broadcasting, service, pbs, the, companion, book, to, the, series, co, authored, by, milton, and, his, wife, rose,

measured, 5, feet, 0, inches, 1, 52, m, and, has, been, described, as, an, elfin, libertarian, by, binyamin, appelbaum, rose, friedman, when, asked, about, friedman, s, successes, said, that, i, have, never, had, the, desire, to, compete, with, milton, professionally, perhaps, because, i, was, smart, enough, to, recognize, i, couldn, t, on, the, other, hand, he, has, always, made, me, feel, that, his, achievement, is, my, achievement, during, the, 1960s, friedman, built, and, subsequently, maintained, a, cottage, in, fairlee, vermont, friedman, also, had, an, apartment, in, russian, hill, san, francisco, where, he, lived, from, 1977, until, his, death, according, to, a, 2007, article, in, commentary, magazine, his, parents, were, moderately, observant, jews, but, friedman, after, an, intense, burst, of, childhood, piety, rejected, religion, altogether, he, described, himself, as, an, agnostic, friedman, wrote, extensively, of, his, life, and, experiences, especially, in, 1998, in, his, memoirs, with, his, wife, rose, titled, two, lucky, people, in, this, book, rose, friedman, describes, how, she, and, milton, friedman, raised, their, two, children, janet, and, david, with, a, christmas, tree, in, the, home, orthodox, jews, of, course, do, not, celebrate, christmas, however, just, as, when, i, was, a, child, my, mother, had, permitted, me, to, have, a, christmas, tree, one, year, when, my, friend, had, one, she, not, only, tolerated, our, having, a, christmas, tree, she, even, strung, popcorn, to, hang, on, it, friedman, died, of, heart, failure, at, the, age, of, 94,

the, day, after, his, death, he, was, survived, by, his, wife, rose, friedman, who, would, die, on, august, 18, 2009, and, their, two, children, david, d, friedman, known, for, the, machinery, of, freedom, as, well, as, his, unique, anarcho, capitalism, from, a, chicago, school, perspective, and, attorney, and, bridge, player, jan, martel, friedman, was, best, known, for, reviving, interest, in, the, money, supply, as, a, determinant, of, the, nominal, value, of, output, that, is, the, quantity, theory, of, money, monetarism, is, the, set, of, views, associated, with, modern, quantity, theory, its, origins, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 16th, century, school, of, salamanca, or, even, further, however, friedman, s, contribution, is, largely, responsible, for, its, modern, popularization, he, co, authored, with, anna, schwartz, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, 1867, 1960, 1963, which, was, an, examination, of, the, role, of, the, money, supply, and, economic, activity, in, the, u, s, history, friedman, was, the, main, proponent, of, the, monetarist, school, of, economics, he, maintained, that, there, is, a, close, and, stable, association, between, inflation, and, the, money, supply, mainly, that, inflation, could, be, avoided, with, proper, regulation, of, the, monetary, base, s, growth, rate, he, famously, used, the, analogy, of, dropping, money, out, of, a, helicopter, to, avoid, dealing, with, money, injection, mechanisms, and, other, factors, that, would, overcomplicate, his, models, friedman, s, arguments, were, designed, to, counter, the, popular, concept, of, cost, push, inflation, that, the, increased, general, price, level, at, the, time, was, the, result, of, increases, in, the, price, of, oil, or, increases, in, wages, as, he, wrote, inflation, is, always, and, everywhere, a, monetary, phenomenon, friedman, rejected, the, use, of, fiscal, policy, as, a, tool, of, demand, management, and, he, held, that, the, government, s, role, in, the, guidance, of, the, economy, should, be, restricted, severely, friedman, wrote, extensively, on, the, great, depression, and, he, termed, the, 1929, 1933, period, the, great, contraction, he, argued, that, the, depression, had, been, caused, by, an, ordinary, financial, shock, and, the, duration, and, seriousness, of, which, were, greatly, increased, by, the, subsequent, contraction, of, the, money, supply, caused, by, the, misguided, policies, of, the, directors, of, the, federal, reserve, the, fed, was, largely, responsible, for, converting, what, might, have, been, a, garden, variety, recession, although, perhaps, a, fairly, severe, one, into, a, major, catastrophe, instead, of, using, its, powers, to, offset, the, depression, it, presided, over, a, decline, in, the, quantity, of, money, by, one, third, from, 1929, to, 1933, far, from, the, depression, being, a, failure, of, the, free, enterprise, system, it, was, a, tragic, failure, of, government, this, theory, was, put, forth, in, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, and, the, chapter, on, the, great, depression, was, then, published, as, a, stand, alone, book, entitled, the, great, contraction, 1929, 1933, both, books, are, still, in, print, from, the, princeton, university, press, and, some, editions, include, as, an, appendix, a, speech, at, a, university, of, chicago, event, honoring, friedman, in, which, ben, bernanke, made, this, statement, let, me, end, my, talk, by, abusing, slightly, my, status, as, an, official, representative, of, the, federal, reserve, i, would, like, to, say, to, milton, and, anna, regarding, the, great, depression, you, re, right, we, did, it, we, re, very, sorry, but, thanks, to, you, we, won, t, do, it, again, friedman, also, argued, for, the, removal, of, government, intervention, in, currency, markets, thereby, spawning, an, enormous, literature, on, the, subject, as, well, as, promoting, the, practice, of, freely, floating, exchange, rates, his, close, friend, george, stigler, explained, as, is, customary, in, science, he, did, not, win, a, full, victory, in, part, because, research, was, directed, along, different, lines, by, the, theory, of, rational, expectations, a, newer, approach, developed, by, robert, lucas, also, at, the, university, of, chicago, the, relationship, between, friedman, and, lucas, or, new, classical, macroeconomics, as, a, whole, was, highly, complex, the, friedmanian, phillips, curve, was, an, interesting, starting, point, for, lucas, but, he, soon, realized, that, the, solution, provided, by, friedman, was, not, quite, satisfactory, lucas, elaborated, a, new, approach, in, which, rational, expectations, were, presumed, instead, of, the, friedmanian, adaptive, expectations, due, to, this, reformulation, the, story, in, which, the, theory, of, the, new, classical, phillips, curve, was, embedded, radically, changed, this, modification, however, had, a, significant, effect, on, friedman, s, own, approach, so, as, a, result, the, theory, of, the, friedmanian, phillips, curve, also, changed, moreover, new, classical, adherent, neil, wallace, who, was, a, graduate, student, at, the, university, of, chicago, between, 1960, and, 1963, regarded, friedman, s, theoretical, courses, as, a, mess, highlighting, the, strained, relationship, between, monetarism, and, new, classical, schools, friedman, was, also, known, for, his, work, on, the, consumption, function, the, permanent, income, hypothesis, 1957, which, friedman, himself, referred, to, as, his, best, scientific, work, this, work, contended, that, utility, maximizing, consumers, would, spend, a, proportional, amount, of, what, they, perceived, to, be, their, permanent, income, permanent, income, refers, to, such, factors, like, human, capital, windfall, gains, would, mostly, be, saved, because, of, the, law, of, diminishing, marginal, utility, friedman, s, essay, the, methodology, of, positive, economics, 1953, provided, the, epistemological, pattern, for, his, own, subsequent, research, and, to, a, degree, that, of, the, chicago, school, there, he, argued, that, economics, as, science, should, be, free, of, value, judgments, for, it, to, be, objective, moreover, a, useful, economic, theory, should, be, judged, not, by, its, descriptive, realism, but, by, its, simplicity, and, fruitfulness, as, an, engine, of, prediction, that, is, students, should, measure, the, accuracy, of, its, predictions, rather, than, the, soundness, of, its, assumptions, his, argument, was, part, of, an, ongoing, debate, among, such, statisticians, as, jerzy, neyman, leonard, savage, and, ronald, fisher, while, being, an, advocate, of, the, free, market, friedman, believed, that, the, government, had, two, crucial, roles, in, an, interview, with, phil, donahue, friedman, argued, that, the, two, basic, functions, of, a, government, are, to, protect, the, nation, against, foreign, enemy, and, to, protect, citizens, against, its, fellows, he, also, admitted, that, although, privatization, of, national, defense, could, reduce, the, overall, cost, he, has, not, yet, thought, of, a, way, to, make, this, privatization, possible, other, important, contributions, include, his, critique, of, the, phillips, curve, and, the, concept, of, the, natural, rate, of, unemployment, 1968, this, critique, associated, his, name, together, with, that, of, edmund, phelps, with, the, insight, that, a, government, that, brings, about, greater, inflation, cannot, permanently, reduce, unemployment, by, doing, so, unemployment, may, be, temporarily, lower, if, the, inflation, is, a, surprise, but, in, the, long, run, unemployment, will, be, determined, by, the, frictions, and, imperfections, of, the, labor, market, if, the, conditions, are, not, met, and, inflation, is, expected, the, long, run, effects, will, replace, the, short, term, effects, through, his, critique, the, philips, curve, evolved, from, a, strict, model, emphasizing, the, connection, between, inflation, and, unemployment, as, being, absolute, to, a, model, which, emphasized, short, term, unemployment, reductions, and, long, term, employment, stagnations, friedman, s, revised, and, updated, phillips, curve, also, changed, as, a, result, of, robert, lucas, s, idea, of, rational, expectations, replacing, the, adaptive, expectations, friedman, used, one, of, his, most, famous, contributions, to, statistics, is, sequential, sampling, friedman, did, statistical, work, at, the, division, of, war, research, at, columbia, where, he, and, his, colleagues, came, up, with, the, technique, it, became, in, the, words, of, the, new, palgrave, dictionary, of, economics, the, standard, analysis, of, quality, control, inspection, the, dictionary, adds, like, many, of, friedman, s, contributions, in, retrospect, it, seems, remarkably, simple, and, obvious, to, apply, basic, economic, ideas, to, quality, control, that, however, is, a, measure, of, his, genius, friedman, criticised, corporate, social, responsibility, most, famously, in, an, op, ed, in, the, new, york, times, magazine, in, 1970, friedman, argued, that, businesses, often, used, claims, about, social, responsibility, to, increase, returns, and, described, them, as, hypocritical, window, dressing, managers, were, also, poorly, prepared, to, make, decisions, about, social, causes, and, these, outlays, diverted, funds, that, belonged, instead, to, shareholders, friedman, believed, that, only, monopolistic, corporations, could, routinely, make, altruistic, expenditures, on, social, responsibility, because, in, a, competitive, market, such, costs, would, undermine, the, business, although, friedman, concluded, the, government, does, have, a, role, in, the, monetary, system, he, was, critical, of, the, federal, reserve, due, to, its, poor, performance, and, felt, it, should, be, abolished, he, was, opposed, to, federal, reserve, policies, even, during, the, so, called, volcker, shock, that, was, labeled, monetarist, friedman, believed, the, federal, reserve, system, should, ultimately, be, replaced, with, a, computer, program, he, favored, a, system, that, would, automatically, buy, and, sell, securities, in, response, to, changes, in, the, money, supply, the, proposal, to, constantly, grow, the, money, supply, at, a, certain, predetermined, amount, every, year, has, become, known, as, friedman, s, k, percent, rule, there, is, debate, about, the, effectiveness, of, a, theoretical, money, supply, targeting, regime, the, fed, s, inability, to, meet, its, money, supply, targets, from, 1978, to, 1982, led, some, to, conclude, it, is, not, a, feasible, alternative, to, more, conventional, inflation, and, interest, rate, targeting, towards, the, end, of, his, life, friedman, expressed, doubt, about, the, validity, of, targeting, the, quantity, of, money, to, date, most, countries, have, adopted, inflation, targeting, instead, of, the, k, percent, rule, idealistically, friedman, actually, favored, the, principles, of, the, 1930s, chicago, plan, which, would, have, ended, fractional, reserve, banking, and, thus, private, money, creation, it, would, force, banks, to, have, 100, reserves, backing, deposits, and, instead, place, money, creation, powers, solely, in, the, hands, of, the, us, government, this, would, make, targeting, money, growth, more, possible, as, endogenous, money, created, by, fractional, reserve, lending, would, no, longer, be, a, major, issue, friedman, was, a, strong, advocate, for, floating, exchange, rates, throughout, the, entire, bretton, woods, period, 1944, 1971, he, argued, that, a, flexible, exchange, rate, would, make, external, adjustment, possible, and, allow, countries, to, avoid, balance, of, payments, crises, he, saw, fixed, exchange, rates, as, an, undesirable, form, of, government, intervention, the, case, was, articulated, in, an, influential, 1953, paper, the, case, for, flexible, exchange, rates, at, a, time, when, most, commentators, regarded, the, possibility, of, floating, exchange, rates, as, an, unrealistic, policy, proposal, while, walter, oi, is, credited, with, establishing, the, economic, basis, for, a, volunteer, military, friedman, was, a, proponent, and, was, credited, with, ending, the, draft, stating, that, the, draft, was, inconsistent, with, a, free, society, in, capitalism, and, freedom, he, argued, conscription, is, inequitable, and, arbitrary, preventing, young, men, from, shaping, their, lives, as, they, see, fit, during, the, nixon, administration, he, headed, the, committee, to, research, a, conversion, to, paid, volunteer, armed, force, friedman, did, however, believe, the, introduction, of, a, system, of, universal, military, training, as, a, reserve, in, cases, of, war, time, could, be, justified, he, still, opposed, its, implementation, in, the, united, states, describing, it, as, a, monstrosity, biographer, lanny, ebenstein, noted, a, drift, over, time, in, friedman, s, views, from, an, interventionist, to, a, more, cautious, foreign, policy, he, supported, us, involvement, in, the, second, world, war, and, initially, supported, a, hard, line, against, communism, but, moderated, over, time, however, friedman, did, state, in, a, 1995, interview, that, he, was, an, anti, interventionist, he, opposed, the, gulf, war, and, the, iraq, war, in, a, spring, 2006, interview, friedman, said, the, us, s, stature, in, the, world, had, been, eroded, by, the, iraq, war, but, that, it, might, be, improved, if, iraq, were, to, become, a, peaceful, and, independent, country, friedman, was, an, economic, advisor, and, speech, writer, in, barry, goldwater, s, failed, presidential, campaign, in, 1964, he, was, an, advisor, to, california, governor, ronald, reagan, and, was, active, in, reagan, s, presidential, campaigns, he, served, as, a, member, of, president, reagan, s, economic, policy, advisory, board, starting, in, 1981, in, 1988, he, received, the, presidential, medal, of, freedom, and, the, national, medal, of, science, in, a, 1995, interview, with, reason, magazine, friedman, criticized, murray, rothbard, and, ayn, rand, as, cult, builders, and, dogmatists, citing, this, as, justification, for, not, joining, the, u, s, libertarian, party, friedman, stated, that, he, was, a, member, of, the, republican, party, not, because, they, have, any, principles, but, because, that, s, the, way, i, am, the, most, useful, and, have, most, influence, he, described, his, philosophy, as, clearly, libertarian, though, distanced, himself, from, zero, government, libertarianism, which, he, called, infeasible, citing, the, lack, of, historical, examples, of, that, philosophy, succeeding, friedman, attended, the, future, of, freedom, conference, which, was, a, meeting, for, libertarians, in, 1990, his, citation, for, the, presidential, medal, of, freedom, reads, he, has, used, a, brilliant, mind, to, advance, a, moral, vision, the, vision, of, a, society, where, men, and, women, are, free, free, to, choose, but, where, government, is, not, as, free, to, override, their, decisions, that, vision, has, changed, america, and, it, is, changing, the, world, all, of, us, owe, a, tremendous, debt, to, this, man, s, towering, intellect, and, his, devotion, to, liberty, in, a, 1962, essay, that, builds, on, arguments, made, by, a, v, dicey, friedman, argued, that, a, free, society, would, constitute, a, desirable, but, unstable, equilibrium, due, to, an, asymmetry, between, the, visible, benefits, and, the, hidden, harms, of, government, intervention, he, uses, tariffs, as, an, example, of, a, policy, that, brings, noticeable, financial, benefits, to, a, visible, group, but, causes, worse, harms, to, a, diffuse, group, of, workers, and, consumers, friedman, was, supportive, of, the, state, provision, of, some, public, goods, that, private, businesses, are, not, considered, as, being, able, to, provide, however, he, argued, that, many, of, the, services, performed, by, government, could, be, performed, better, by, the, private, sector, above, all, if, some, public, goods, are, provided, by, the, state, he, believed, that, they, should, not, be, a, legal, monopoly, where, private, competition, is, prohibited, for, example, he, wrote, there, is, no, way, to, justify, our, present, public, monopoly, of, the, post, office, it, may, be, argued, that, the, carrying, of, mail, is, a, technical, monopoly, and, that, a, government, monopoly, is, the, least, of, evils, along, these, lines, one, could, perhaps, justify, a, government, post, office, but, not, the, present, law, which, makes, it, illegal, for, anybody, else, to, carry, the, mail, if, the, delivery, of, mail, is, a, technical, monopoly, no, one, else, will, be, able, to, succeed, in, competition, with, the, government, if, it, is, not, there, is, no, reason, why, the, government, should, be, engaged, in, it, the, only, way, to, find, out, is, to, leave, other, people, free, to, enter, in, 1962, friedman, criticized, social, security, in, his, book, capitalism, and, freedom, arguing, that, it, had, created, welfare, dependency, however, in, the, penultimate, chapter, of, the, same, book, friedman, argued, that, while, capitalism, had, greatly, reduced, the, extent, of, poverty, in, absolute, terms, poverty, is, in, part, a, relative, matter, even, in, countries, there, are, clearly, many, people, living, under, conditions, that, the, rest, of, us, label, as, poverty, friedman, also, noted, that, while, private, charity, could, be, one, recourse, for, alleviating, poverty, and, cited, late, 19th, century, britain, and, the, united, states, as, exemplary, periods, of, extensive, private, charity, and, eleemosynary, activity, he, made, the, following, point, it, can, be, argued, that, private, charity, is, insufficient, because, the, benefits, from, it, accrue, to, people, other, than, those, who, make, the, gifts, a, neighborhood, effect, i, am, distressed, by, the, sight, of, poverty, i, am, benefited, by, its, alleviation, but, i, am, benefited, equally, whether, i, or, someone, else, pays, for, its, alleviation, the, benefits, of, other, people, s, charity, therefore, partly, accrue, to, me, to, put, it, differently, we, might, all, of, us, be, willing, to, contribute, to, the, relief, of, poverty, provided, everyone, else, did, we, might, not, be, willing, to, contribute, the, same, amount, without, such, assurance, in, small, communities, public, pressure, can, suffice, to, realize, the, proviso, even, with, private, charity, in, the, large, impersonal, communities, that, are, increasingly, coming, to, dominate, our, society, it, is, much, more, difficult, for, it, to, do, so, suppose, one, accepts, as, i, do, this, line, of, reasoning, as, justifying, governmental, action, to, alleviate, poverty, to, set, as, it, were, a, floor, under, the, standard, of, life, of, every, person, in, the, community, arrangement, that, recommends, itself, on, purely, mechanical, grounds, is, a, negative, income, tax, the, advantages, of, this, arrangement, are, clear, it, is, directed, specifically, at, the, problem, of, poverty, it, gives, help, in, the, form, most, useful, to, the, individual, namely, cash, it, is, general, and, could, be, substituted, for, the, host, of, special, measures, now, in, effect, it, makes, explicit, the, cost, borne, by, society, it, operates, outside, the, market, like, any, other, measures, to, alleviate, poverty, it, reduces, the, incentives, of, those, helped, to, help, themselves, but, it, does, not, eliminate, that, incentive, entirely, as, a, system, of, supplementing, incomes, up, to, some, fixed, minimum, would, an, extra, dollar, earned, always, means, more, money, available, for, expenditure, friedman, argued, further, that, other, advantages, of, the, negative, income, tax, were, that, it, could, fit, directly, into, the, tax, system, would, be, less, costly, and, would, reduce, the, administrative, burden, of, implementing, a, social, safety, net, friedman, reiterated, these, arguments, 18, years, later, in, free, to, choose, with, the, additional, proviso, that, such, a, reform, would, only, be, satisfactory, if, it, replaced, the, current, system, of, welfare, programs, rather, than, augment, it, according, to, economist, robert, h, frank, writing, in, the, new, york, times, friedman, s, views, in, this, regard, were, grounded, in, a, belief, that, while, market, forces, accomplish, wonderful, things, they, cannot, ensure, a, distribution, of, income, that, enables, all, citizens, to, meet, basic, economic, needs, friedman, also, criticized, urban, renewal, programs, in, the, united, states, due, to, their, racially, discriminatory, and, economically, regressive, effects, in, 1979, friedman, expressed, support, for, environmental, taxes, in, general, in, an, interview, on, the, phil, donahue, show, saying, the, best, way, to, is, to, impose, a, tax, on, the, cost, of, the, pollutants, emitted, by, a, car, and, make, an, incentive, for, car, manufacturers, and, for, consumers, to, keep, down, the, amount, of, pollution, in, free, to, choose, friedman, reiterated, his, support, for, environmental, taxes, as, compared, with, increased, environmental, regulation, stating, the, preservation, of, the, environment, and, the, avoidance, of, undue, pollution, are, real, problems, and, they, are, problems, concerning, which, the, government, has, an, important, role, to, play, most, economists, agree, that, a, far, better, way, to, control, pollution, than, the, present, method, of, specific, regulation, and, supervision, is, to, introduce, market, discipline, by, imposing, effluent, charges, in, his, 1955, article, the, role, of, government, in, education, friedman, proposed, supplementing, publicly, operated, schools, with, privately, run, but, publicly, funded, schools, through, a, system, of, school, vouchers, reforms, similar, to, those, proposed, in, the, article, were, implemented, in, for, example, chile, in, 1981, and, sweden, in, 1992, in, 1996, friedman, together, with, his, wife, founded, the, friedman, foundation, for, educational, choice, to, advocate, school, choice, and, vouchers, in, 2016, the, friedman, foundation, changed, its, name, to, edchoice, to, honor, the, friedmans, desire, to, have, the, educational, choice, movement, live, on, without, their, names, attached, to, it, after, their, deaths, michael, walker, of, the, fraser, institute, and, friedman, hosted, a, series, of, conferences, from, 1986, to, 1994, the, goal, was, to, create, a, clear, definition, of, economic, freedom, and, a, method, for, measuring, it, eventually, this, resulted, in, the, first, report, on, worldwide, economic, freedom, economic, freedom, in, the, world, this, annual, report, has, since, provided, data, for, numerous, peer, reviewed, studies, and, has, influenced, policy, in, several, nations, with, sixteen, other, distinguished, economists, he, opposed, the, copyright, term, extension, act, and, signed, on, to, an, amicus, brief, filed, in, eldred, v, ashcroft, friedman, jokingly, described, it, as, a, no, brainer, friedman, argued, for, stronger, basic, legal, constitutional, protection, of, economic, rights, and, freedoms, to, further, promote, industrial, commercial, growth, and, prosperity, and, buttress, democracy, and, freedom, and, the, rule, of, law, generally, in, society, friedman, suggested, medical, savings, accounts, repealing, tax, exemptions, of, employer, provided, medical, care, and, income, based, deductibles, as, ways, to, lower, health, care, costs, in, america, friedman, also, argued, that, federal, involvement, in, health, care, should, be, restricted, with, state, and, local, governments, financing, health, care, for, the, poor, friedman, also, supported, libertarian, policies, such, as, legalization, of, drugs, and, prostitution, during, 2005, friedman, and, more, than, 500, other, economists, advocated, discussions, regarding, the, economic, benefits, of, the, legalization, of, marijuana, friedman, was, also, a, supporter, of, gay, rights, he, never, specifically, supported, same, sex, marriage, instead, saying, i, do, not, believe, there, should, be, any, discrimination, against, gays, friedman, favored, immigration, saying, legal, and, illegal, immigration, has, a, very, positive, impact, on, the, u, s, economy, however, he, suggested, that, immigrants, ought, not, to, have, access, to, the, welfare, system, friedman, stated, that, immigration, from, mexico, had, been, a, good, thing, in, particular, illegal, immigration, friedman, argued, that, illegal, immigration, was, a, boon, because, they, take, jobs, that, most, residents, of, this, country, are, unwilling, to, take, they, provide, employers, with, workers, of, a, kind, they, cannot, get, and, they, do, not, use, welfare, in, free, to, choose, friedman, wrote, no, arbitrary, obstacles, should, prevent, people, from, achieving, those, positions, for, which, their, talents, fit, them, and, which, their, values, lead, them, to, seek, not, birth, nationality, color, religion, sex, nor, any, other, irrelevant, characteristic, should, determine, the, opportunities, that, are, open, to, a, person, only, his, abilities, friedman, also, famously, argued, that, the, welfare, state, must, end, before, immigration, or, more, specifically, before, open, borders, because, immigrants, might, have, an, incentive, to, come, directly, because, of, welfare, payments, economist, bryan, caplan, has, disputed, this, assertion, arguing, that, welfare, is, generally, distributed, not, among, immigrants, but, instead, retirees, through, social, security, friedman, was, against, public, housing, as, he, believed, it, was, also, a, form, of, welfare, he, believed, that, one, of, the, main, arguments, politicians, have, for, public, housing, is, that, regular, low, income, housing, was, too, expensive, due, to, the, imposed, higher, cost, of, a, fire, and, police, department, he, believed, that, it, would, only, increase, taxes, and, not, benefit, low, income, people, in, the, long, run, friedman, was, an, advocate, for, direct, cash, instead, of, public, housing, believing, that, the, people, would, be, better, off, that, way, he, argued, that, liberals, would, never, agree, with, this, idea, due, to, them, not, trusting, their, own, citizens, he, also, stated, that, regression, has, already, happened, with, more, land, being, left, vacant, due, to, slow, construction, friedman, argued, that, public, housing, instead, encourages, juvenile, delinquency, friedman, was, also, against, minimum, wage, laws, he, saw, them, as, a, clear, case, as, one, can, find, that, the, precise, opposite, is, happening, when, this, was, attempted, minimum, wage, laws, would, increase, unemployment, in, his, eyes, and, that, employers, would, not, hire, back, workers, that, were, already, there, for, less, pay, in, his, view, this, would, leave, low, income, people, worse, off, because, the, voters, for, minimum, wage, laws, would, then, become, the, victims, of, unemployment, he, believed, that, these, ideas, of, new, minimum, wage, laws, came, from, northern, factories, and, unions, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, competition, from, the, south, george, h, nash, a, leading, historian, of, american, conservatism, says, that, by, the, end, of, the, 1960s, he, was, probably, the, most, highly, regarded, and, influential, conservative, scholar, in, the, country, and, one, of, the, few, with, an, international, reputation, in, 1971, friedman, received, the, golden, plate, award, of, the, american, academy, of, achievement, friedman, allowed, the, libertarian, cato, institute, to, use, his, name, for, its, biennial, milton, friedman, prize, for, advancing, liberty, beginning, in, 2001, a, friedman, prize, was, given, to, the, late, british, economist, peter, bauer, in, 2002, peruvian, economist, hernando, de, soto, in, 2004, mart, laar, former, estonian, prime, minister, in, 2006, and, a, young, venezuelan, student, yon, goicoechea, in, 2008, his, wife, rose, sister, of, aaron, director, with, whom, he, initiated, the, friedman, foundation, for, educational, choice, served, on, the, international, selection, committee, friedman, was, a, recipient, of, the, nobel, memorial, prize, in, economics, upon, friedman, s, death, harvard, president, lawrence, summers, called, him, the, great, liberator, saying, any, honest, democrat, will, admit, that, we, are, now, all, friedmanites, he, said, friedman, s, great, popular, contribution, was, in, convincing, people, of, the, importance, of, allowing, free, markets, to, operate, stephen, moore, a, member, of, the, editorial, forward, of, the, wall, street, journal, said, in, 2013, quoting, the, most, revered, champion, of, free, market, economics, since, adam, smith, has, become, a, little, like, quoting, the, bible, he, adds, there, are, sometimes, multiple, and, conflicting, interpretations, although, post, keynesian, economist, j, k, galbraith, was, a, prominent, critic, of, friedman, and, his, ideology, he, observed, that, the, age, of, john, maynard, keynes, gave, way, to, the, age, of, milton, friedman, friedman, was, awarded, the, nobel, memorial, prize, in, economic, sciences, the, sole, recipient, for, 1976, for, his, achievements, in, the, fields, of, consumption, analysis, monetary, history, and, theory, and, for, his, demonstration, of, the, complexity, of, stabilization, policy, his, appointment, was, controversial, mainly, for, his, association, with, military, dictator, augusto, pinochet, some, economists, such, as, institutional, economist, and, 1974, nobel, prize, winner, gunnar, myrdal, criticized, friedman, and, myrdal, s, own, 1974, nobel, prize, partner, friedrich, hayek, for, being, reactionaries, myrdal, s, criticism, caused, some, economists, to, oppose, the, sveriges, riksbank, prize, in, economics, sciences, in, memory, of, alfred, nobel, itself, friedman, said, if, you, want, to, see, capitalism, in, action, go, to, hong, kong, he, wrote, in, 1990, that, the, hong, kong, economy, was, perhaps, the, best, example, of, a, free, market, economy, one, month, before, his, death, he, wrote, hong, kong, wrong, what, would, cowperthwaite, say, in, the, wall, street, journal, criticizing, donald, tsang, chief, executive, of, hong, kong, for, abandoning, positive, non, interventionism, tsang, later, said, he, was, merely, changing, the, slogan, to, big, market, small, government, where, small, government, is, defined, as, less, than, 20, of, gdp, in, a, debate, between, tsang, and, his, rival, alan, leong, before, the, 2007, hong, kong, chief, executive, election, leong, introduced, the, topic, and, jokingly, accused, tsang, of, angering, friedman, to, death, friedman, had, died, only, a, year, prior, during, 1975, two, years, after, the, military, coup, that, brought, military, dictator, augusto, pinochet, to, power, and, ended, the, government, of, salvador, allende, the, economy, of, chile, experienced, a, severe, crisis, friedman, and, arnold, harberger, accepted, an, invitation, of, a, private, chilean, foundation, to, visit, chile, and, speak, on, principles, of, economic, freedom, he, spent, seven, days, in, chile, giving, a, series, of, lectures, at, the, pontifical, catholic, university, of, chile, and, the, university, of, chile, one, of, the, lectures, was, entitled, the, fragility, of, freedom, and, according, to, friedman, dealt, with, precisely, the, threat, to, freedom, from, a, centralized, military, government, in, a, letter, to, pinochet, of, april, 21, 1975, friedman, considered, the, key, economic, problems, of, chile, are, clearly, inflation, and, the, promotion, of, a, healthy, social, market, economy, he, stated, that, there, is, only, one, way, to, end, inflation, by, drastically, reducing, the, rate, of, increase, of, the, quantity, of, money, and, that, cutting, government, spending, is, by, far, and, away, the, most, desirable, way, to, reduce, the, fiscal, deficit, because, it, strengthens, the, private, sector, thereby, laying, the, foundations, for, healthy, economic, growth, as, to, how, rapidly, inflation, should, be, ended, friedman, felt, that, for, chile, where, inflation, is, raging, at, 10, 20, a, month, gradualism, is, not, feasible, it, would, involve, so, painful, an, operation, over, so, long, a, period, that, the, patient, would, not, survive, choosing, a, brief, period, of, higher, unemployment, was, the, lesser, evil, and, that, the, experience, of, germany, of, brazil, of, the, post, war, adjustment, in, the, u, s, all, argue, for, shock, treatment, in, the, letter, friedman, recommended, to, deliver, the, shock, approach, with, a, package, to, eliminate, the, surprise, and, to, relieve, acute, distress, and, for, definiteness, let, me, sketch, the, contents, of, a, package, proposal, to, be, taken, as, illustrative, although, his, knowledge, of, chile, was, too, limited, to, enable, to, be, precise, or, comprehensive, he, listed, a, sample, proposal, of, 8, monetary, and, fiscal, measures, including, the, removal, of, as, many, as, obstacles, as, possible, that, now, hinder, the, private, market, for, example, suspend, the, present, law, against, discharging, employees, he, closed, stating, such, a, shock, program, could, end, inflation, in, months, his, letter, suggested, that, cutting, spending, to, reduce, the, fiscal, deficit, would, result, in, less, transitional, unemployment, than, raising, taxes, sergio, de, castro, a, chilean, chicago, school, graduate, became, the, nation, s, minister, of, finance, in, 1975, during, his, six, year, tenure, foreign, investment, increased, restrictions, were, placed, on, striking, and, labor, unions, and, gdp, rose, yearly, a, foreign, exchange, program, was, created, between, the, catholic, university, of, chile, and, the, university, of, chicago, many, other, chicago, school, alumni, were, appointed, government, posts, during, and, after, pinochet, s, dictatorship, others, taught, its, economic, doctrine, at, chilean, universities, they, became, known, as, the, chicago, boys, friedman, defended, his, activity, in, chile, on, the, grounds, that, in, his, opinion, the, adoption, of, free, market, policies, not, only, improved, the, economic, situation, of, chile, but, also, contributed, to, the, amelioration, of, pinochet, s, rule, and, to, the, eventual, transition, to, a, democratic, government, during, 1990, that, idea, is, included, in, capitalism, and, freedom, in, which, he, declared, that, economic, freedom, is, not, only, desirable, in, itself, but, is, also, a, necessary, condition, for, political, freedom, in, his, 1980, documentary, free, to, choose, he, said, the, following, chile, is, not, a, politically, free, system, and, i, do, not, condone, the, system, but, the, people, there, are, freer, than, the, people, in, communist, societies, because, government, plays, a, smaller, role, the, conditions, of, the, people, in, the, past, few, years, has, been, getting, better, and, not, worse, they, would, be, still, better, to, get, rid, of, the, junta, and, to, be, able, to, have, a, free, democratic, system, in, 1984, friedman, stated, that, he, has, never, refrained, from, criticizing, the, political, system, in, chile, in, 1991, he, said, i, have, nothing, good, to, say, about, the, political, regime, that, pinochet, imposed, it, was, a, terrible, political, regime, the, real, miracle, of, chile, is, not, how, well, it, has, done, economically, the, real, miracle, of, chile, is, that, a, military, junta, was, willing, to, go, against, its, principles, and, support, a, free, market, regime, designed, by, principled, believers, in, a, free, market, in, chile, the, drive, for, political, freedom, that, was, generated, by, economic, freedom, and, the, resulting, economic, success, ultimately, resulted, in, a, referendum, that, introduced, political, democracy, now, at, long, last, chile, has, all, three, things, political, freedom, human, freedom, and, economic, freedom, chile, will, continue, to, be, an, interesting, experiment, to, watch, to, see, whether, it, can, keep, all, three, or, whether, now, that, it, has, political, freedom, that, political, freedom, will, tend, to, be, used, to, destroy, or, reduce, economic, freedom, he, stressed, that, the, lectures, he, gave, in, chile, were, the, same, lectures, he, later, gave, in, china, and, other, socialist, states, he, further, stated, i, do, not, consider, it, as, evil, for, an, economist, to, render, technical, economic, advice, to, the, chilean, government, any, more, than, i, would, regard, it, as, evil, for, a, physician, to, give, technical, medical, advice, to, the, chilean, government, to, help, end, a, medical, plague, during, the, 2000, pbs, documentary, the, commanding, heights, based, on, the, book, friedman, continued, to, argue, that, free, markets, would, undermine, political, centralization, and, political, control, and, that, criticism, over, his, role, in, chile, missed, his, main, contention, that, freer, markets, resulted, in, freer, people, and, that, chile, s, unfree, economy, had, caused, pinochet, s, rise, friedman, advocated, for, free, markets, which, undermined, political, centralization, and, political, control, because, of, his, involvement, with, the, government, of, chile, which, was, a, dictatorship, at, the, time, of, his, visit, there, were, international, protests, spanning, from, sweden, to, america, when, friedman, was, awarded, the, nobel, memorial, prize, in, 1976, friedman, was, accused, of, supporting, the, military, dictatorship, in, chile, because, of, the, relation, of, economists, of, the, university, of, chicago, to, pinochet, and, a, seven, day, trip, he, took, to, chile, during, march, 1975, less, than, two, years, after, the, coup, that, ended, with, the, death, of, president, salvador, allende, friedman, answered, that, he, was, never, an, advisor, to, the, dictatorship, but, only, gave, some, lectures, and, seminars, on, inflation, and, met, with, officials, including, augusto, pinochet, the, head, of, the, military, dictatorship, while, in, chile, after, a, 1991, speech, on, drug, legalization, friedman, answered, a, question, on, his, involvement, with, the, pinochet, regime, saying, that, he, was, never, an, advisor, to, pinochet, also, mentioned, in, his, 1984, iceland, interview, but, that, a, group, university, of, chicago, students, were, involved, in, chile, s, economic, reforms, friedman, credited, these, reforms, with, high, levels, of, economic, growth, and, with, the, establishment, of, democracy, that, has, subsequently, occurred, in, chile, in, october, 1988, after, returning, from, a, lecture, tour, of, china, during, which, he, had, met, with, zhao, ziyang, general, secretary, of, the, chinese, communist, party, friedman, wrote, to, the, stanford, daily, asking, if, he, should, anticipate, a, similar, avalanche, of, protests, for, having, been, willing, to, give, advice, to, so, evil, a, government, and, if, not, why, not, friedman, visited, iceland, during, the, autumn, of, 1984, met, with, important, icelanders, and, gave, a, lecture, at, the, university, of, iceland, on, the, tyranny, of, the, status, quo, he, participated, in, a, lively, television, debate, on, august, 31, 1984, with, socialist, intellectuals, including, lafur, ragnar, gr, msson, who, later, became, president, of, iceland, when, they, complained, that, a, fee, was, charged, for, attending, his, lecture, at, the, university, and, that, hitherto, lectures, by, visiting, scholars, had, been, free, of, charge, friedman, replied, that, previous, lectures, had, not, been, free, of, charge, in, a, meaningful, sense, lectures, always, have, related, costs, what, mattered, was, whether, attendees, or, non, attendees, covered, those, costs, friedman, thought, that, it, was, fairer, that, only, those, who, attended, paid, in, this, discussion, friedman, also, stated, that, he, did, not, receive, any, money, for, delivering, that, lecture, although, friedman, never, visited, estonia, his, book, free, to, choose, influenced, estonia, s, then, 32, year, old, prime, minister, mart, laar, who, has, claimed, that, it, was, the, only, book, on, economics, he, had, read, before, taking, office, laar, s, reforms, are, often, credited, with, responsibility, for, transforming, estonia, from, an, impoverished, soviet, republic, to, the, baltic, tiger, a, prime, element, of, laar, s, program, was, introduction, of, the, flat, tax, laar, won, the, 2006, milton, friedman, prize, for, advancing, liberty, awarded, by, the, cato, institute, after, 1950, friedman, was, frequently, invited, to, lecture, in, britain, and, by, the, 1970s, his, ideas, had, gained, widespread, attention, in, conservative, circles, for, example, he, was, a, regular, speaker, at, the, institute, of, economic, affairs, iea, a, libertarian, think, tank, conservative, politician, margaret, thatcher, closely, followed, iea, programs, and, ideas, and, met, friedman, there, in, 1978, he, also, strongly, influenced, keith, joseph, who, became, thatcher, s, senior, advisor, on, economic, affairs, as, well, as, alan, walters, and, patrick, minford, two, other, key, advisers, major, newspapers, including, the, daily, telegraph, the, times, and, the, financial, times, all, promulgated, friedman, s, monetarist, ideas, to, british, decision, makers, friedman, s, ideas, strongly, influenced, thatcher, and, her, allies, when, she, became, prime, minister, in, 1979, galbraith, strongly, criticised, the, workability, of, the, friedmanite, formula, for, which, he, said, britain, has, volunteered, to, be, the, guinea, pig, after, his, death, a, number, of, obituaries, and, articles, were, written, in, friedman, s, honor, citing, him, as, one, of, the, most, important, and, influential, economists, of, the, post, war, era, milton, friedman, s, somewhat, controversial, legacy, in, america, remains, strong, within, the, conservative, movement, however, some, journalists, and, economists, like, noah, smith, and, scott, sumner, have, argued, friedman, s, academic, legacy, has, been, buried, under, his, political, philosophy, and, misinterpreted, by, modern, conservatives, friedman, exogenous, money, supply, theory, has, been, deeply, criticized, by, british, post, keynesian, economist, nicholas, kaldor, in, the, 1970s, while, friedman, and, monetarist, economists, claimed, that, the, money, supply, was, exogenously, created, by, a, powerful, central, bank, kaldor, claimed, that, the, money, was, created, by, second, tier, banks, through, the, distribution, of, credits, to, households, and, companies, in, the, post, keynesian, framework, central, banks, simply, refinance, second, tier, banks, on, demand, but, are, not, in, the, core, of, monetary, creation, milton, friedman, and, nicholas, kaldor, were, involved, in, a, fierce, debate, in, 1969, 70, in, which, the, monetarist, economist, had, the, upper, hand, in, 1982, kaldor, published, a, book, entitled, the, scourge, of, monetarism, deeply, criticizing, monetarist, inspired, policies, econometrician, david, hendry, criticized, part, of, friedman, s, and, anna, schwartz, s, 1982, monetary, trends, when, asked, about, it, during, an, interview, with, icelandic, tv, in, 1984, friedman, said, that, the, criticism, referred, to, a, different, problem, from, that, which, he, and, schwartz, had, tackled, and, hence, was, irrelevant, and, pointed, out, the, lack, of, consequential, peer, review, amongst, econometricians, on, hendry, s, work, in, 2006, hendry, said, that, friedman, was, guilty, of, serious, errors, of, misunderstanding, that, meant, the, t, ratios, he, reported, for, uk, money, demand, were, overstated, by, nearly, 100, per, cent, and, said, that, in, a, paper, published, in, 1991, with, neil, ericsson, he, had, refuted, almost, every, empirical, claim, made, about, uk, money, demand, by, friedman, and, schwartz, a, 2004, paper, updated, and, confirmed, the, validity, of, the, hendry, ericsson, findings, through, 2000, some, commentators, believe, that, friedman, was, not, open, enough, in, their, view, to, the, possibility, of, market, inefficiencies, economist, noah, smith, argues, that, while, friedman, made, many, important, contributions, to, economic, theory, not, all, of, his, ideas, relating, to, macroeconomics, have, entirely, held, up, over, the, years, and, that, too, few, people, are, willing, to, challenge, them, political, scientist, c, b, macpherson, disagreed, with, friedman, s, historical, assessment, of, economic, freedom, leading, to, political, freedom, suggesting, that, political, freedom, actually, gave, way, to, economic, freedom, for, property, owning, elites, he, also, challenged, the, notion, that, markets, efficiently, allocated, resources, and, rejected, friedman, s, definition, of, liberty, friedman, s, positivist, methodological, approach, to, economics, has, also, been, critiqued, and, debated, finnish, economist, uskali, m, ki, argued, some, of, his, assumptions, were, unrealistic, and, vague, friedman, has, been, criticized, by, some, prominent, austrian, economists, including, murray, rothbard, and, walter, block, block, called, friedman, a, socialist, and, was, critical, of, his, support, for, a, central, banking, system, saying, first, and, foremost, this, economist, supported, the, federal, reserve, system, all, throughout, his, professional, life, that, organization, of, course, does, not, own, the, money, stock, but, controls, it, friedman, was, an, inveterate, hater, of, the, gold, standard, denigrating, its, advocates, as, gold, bugs, rothbard, criticized, friedman, s, conclusion, that, the, great, depression, happened, as, a, result, of, a, deflationary, spiral, arguing, that, this, is, inconsistent, with, the, data, even, though, during, the, period, described, by, friedman, as, the, great, contraction, the, money, supply, did, in, fact, decrease, year, over, year, by, over, 10, percentage, points, although, the, book, was, described, by, the, cato, institute, as, among, the, greatest, economics, books, in, the, 20th, century, and, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, is, widely, considered, to, be, among, the, most, influential, economics, books, ever, made, it, has, endured, criticisms, for, its, conclusion, that, the, federal, reserve, was, to, blame, for, the, great, depression, some, economists, including, noted, friedman, critic, peter, temin, have, raised, questions, about, the, legitimacy, of, friedman, s, claims, about, whether, or, not, monetary, quantity, levels, were, endogenous, rather, than, exogenously, determined, as, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, posits, nobel, prize, winning, economist, paul, krugman, argued, that, the, 2008, recession, proved, that, during, a, recession, a, central, bank, cannot, control, broad, money, m3, money, as, defined, by, the, oecd, and, even, if, it, can, the, money, supply, does, not, bear, a, direct, or, proven, relationship, with, gdp, according, to, krugman, this, was, true, in, the, 1930s, and, the, claim, that, the, federal, reserve, could, have, avoided, the, great, depression, by, reacting, to, what, friedman, called, the, great, contraction, is, highly, dubious, james, tobin, questioned, the, importance, of, velocity, of, money, and, how, informative, this, measure, of, the, frequency, of, transactions, is, to, the, understanding, of, the, various, fluctuations, observed, in, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, economic, historian, barry, eichengreen, argued, that, because, of, the, gold, standard, which, was, at, this, point, in, time, the, chief, monetary, system, of, the, world, the, federal, reserve, s, hands, were, tied, this, was, because, to, retain, the, credibility, of, the, gold, standard, the, federal, reserve, could, not, undertake, actions, like, dramatically, expanding, the, money, supply, as, proposed, by, friedman, and, schwartz, lawrence, mishel, distinguished, fellow, of, the, economic, policy, institute, argues, that, wages, have, been, kept, low, in, the, united, states, because, of, the, friedman, doctrine, namely, the, adoption, of, corporate, practices, and, economic, policies, or, the, blocking, of, reforms, at, the, behest, of, business, and, the, wealthy, elite, which, resulted, in, the, systematic, disempowerment, of, workers, he, argues, that, the, lack, of, worker, power, caused, wage, suppression, increased, wage, inequality, and, exacerbated, racial, disparities, notably, mechanisms, such, as, excessive, unemployment, globalization, eroded, labor, standards, and, their, lack, of, enforcement, weakened, collective, bargaining, and, corporate, structure, changes, that, disadvantage, workers, all, collectively, functioned, to, keep, wages, low, from, 1980, to, 2020, while, economy, wide, productivity, rose, almost, 70, percent, hourly, compensation, for, typical, workers, increased, less, than, 12, percent, while, the, earnings, of, the, top, 1, percent, and, 0, 1, percent, increased, 158, percent, and, 341, percent, respectively
