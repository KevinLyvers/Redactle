a, fellow, mamluk, leader, baybars, in, syria, who, not, only, needed, to, protect, his, own, future, from, the, mongols, but, was, eager, to, avenge, for, islam, the, mongol, capture, of, damascus,

the, crusader, kingdom, of, jerusalem, now, centered, on, acre, but, pope, alexander, iv, had, forbidden, such, an, alliance, tensions, between, franks, and, mongols, also, increased, when, julian,

mongols, as, the, more, immediate, menace, instead, of, taking, sides, the, crusaders, opted, for, a, position, of, cautious, neutrality, between, the, two, forces, in, an, unusual, move, however, they, allowed, the, egyptian, mamluks, to, march, northward, without, hindrance, through, crusader, territory, and, even, let, them, camp, near, acre, to, resupply, when, news, arrived, that, the, mongols, had, crossed, the, jordan, river, in, 1260, sultan, qutuz, and, his, forces, proceeded, southeast, toward, the, spring, of, goliath, known, in, arabic, as, ain, jalut, in, the, jezreel, valley, they, met, the, mongol, army, of, about, 12, 000, in, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, and, fought, relentlessly, for, many, hours, the, mamluk, leader, baybars, mostly, implemented, hit, and, run, tactics, in, an, attempt, to, lure, the, mongol, forces, into, chasing, him, baybars, and, qutuz, had, hidden, the, bulk, of, their, forces, in, the, hills, to, wait, in, ambush, for, the, mongols, to, come, into, range, the, mongol, leader, kitbuqa, already, provoked, by, the, constant, fleeing, of, baybars, and, his, troops, decided, to, march, forwards, with, all, his, troops, on, the, trail, of, the, fleeing, egyptians, when, the, mongols, reached, the, highlands, egyptians, appeared, from, hiding, and, the, mongols, found, themselves, surrounded, by, enemy, forces, as, the, hidden, troops, hit, them, from, the, sides, and, qutuz, attacked, the, mongol, rear, estimates, of, the, size, of, the, egyptian, army, range, from, 24, 000, to, 120, 000, the, mongols, broke, free, of, the, trap, and, even, mounted, a, temporarily, successful, counterattack, but, their, numbers, had, been, depleted, to, the, point, that, the, outcome, was, inevitable, refusing, to, surrender, the, whole, mongol, army, that, had, remained, in, the, region, including, kitbuqa, were, cut, down, and, killed, that, day, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, established, a, high, water, mark, for, the, mongol, conquest, after, the, succession, was, settled, and, his, brother, kublai, khan, was, established, as, great, khan, hulegu, returned, to, his, lands, by, 1262, when, he, massed, his, armies, to, attack, the, mamluks, and, avenge, the, defeat, at, ain, jalut, however, he, was, instead, drawn, into, civil, war, with, batu, khan, s, brother, berke, berke, khan, a, muslim, convert, and, the, grandson, of, genghis, khan, had, promised, retribution, in, his, rage, after, hulegu, s, sack, of, baghdad, and, allied, himself, with, the, mamluks, he, initiated, a, large, series, of, raids, on, hulegu, s, territories, led, by, nogai, khan, hulegu, suffered, a, severe, defeat, in, an, attempted, invasion, north, of, the, caucasus, in, 1263, this, was, the, first, open, war, between, mongols, and, signaled, the, end, of, the, unified, empire, in, retaliation, for, his, failure, hulegu, killed, berke, s, ortogh, and, berke, did, the, same, in, return, even, while, berke, was, muslim, out, of, mongol, brotherhood, he, at, first, resisted, the, idea, of, fighting, hulegu, he, said, mongols, are, killed, by, mongol, swords, if, we, were, united, then, we, would, have, conquered, all, of, the, world, but, the, economic, situation, of, the, golden, horde, due, to, the, actions, of, the, ilkhanate, led, him, to, declare, jihad, because, the, ilkhanids, were, hogging, the, wealth, of, north, iran, and, because, of, the, ilkhanate, s, demands, for, the, golden, horde, not, to, sell, slaves, to, the, mamluks, hulegu, s, mother, sorghaghtani, successfully, navigated, mongol, politics,

apparently, intercepted, in, sicily, by, manfred, king, of, sicily, who, was, allied, with, the, mamluk, sultanate, and, in, conflict, with, pope, urban, iv, and, rychaldus, was, returned, by, ship, on, 10, april, 1262, hulegu, sent, a, letter, through, john, the, hungarian, to, louis, ix, of, france, offering, an, alliance, it, is, unclear, whether, the, letter, ever, reached, louis, ix, in, paris, the, only, manuscript, known, to, have, survived, was, in, vienna, austria, the, letter, stated, hulegu, s, intention, to, capture, jerusalem, for, the, benefit, of, the, pope, and, asked, for, louis, to, send, a, fleet, against, egypt, from, the, head, of, the, mongol, army, anxious, to, devastate, the, perfidious, nation, of, the, saracens, with, the, good, will, support, of, the, christian, faith, so, that, you, who, are, the, rulers, of, the, coasts, on, the, other, side, of, the, sea, endeavor, to, deny, a, refuge, for, the, infidels, your, enemies, and, ours, by, having, your, subjects, diligently, patrol, the, seas, despite, many, attempts, neither, hulegu, nor, his, successors, were, able, to, form, an, alliance, with, europe, although, mongol, culture, in, the, west, was, in, vogue, in, the, 13th, century, many, new, born, children, in, italy, were, named, after, mongol, rulers, including, hulegu, names, such, as, can, grande, great, khan, alaone, hulegu,
