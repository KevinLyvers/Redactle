indeed, the, world, s, first, professional, athlete, to, earn, over, a, billion, dollars, in, his, career, after, accounting, for, the, 10, million, bonus, woods, received, for, the, fedex, cup,

number, of, golf, industry, analysts, expressed, concern, about, his, impact, on, the, competitiveness, of, the, game, and, the, public, appeal, of, professional, golf, sportswriter, bill, lyon, of, knight, ridder, asked, in, a, column, isn, t, tiger, woods, actually, bad, for, golf, though, lyon, ultimately, concluded, that, he, was, not, at, first, some, pundits, feared, that, woods, would, drive, the, spirit, of, competition, out, of, the, game, of, golf, by, making, existing, courses, obsolete, and, relegating, opponents, to, simply, competing, for, second, place, each, week, a, related, effect, was, measured, by, university, of, california, economist, jennifer, brown, who, found, that, other, golfers, scored, worse, when, competing, against, woods, than, when, he, was, not, in, the, tournament, the, scores, of, highly, skilled, golfers, are, nearly, one, stroke, higher, when, playing, against, woods, this, effect, was, larger, when, he, was, on, winning, streaks, and, disappeared, during, his, well, publicized, slump, in, 2003, 04, brown, explains, the, results, by, noting, that, competitors, of, similar, skill, can, hope, to, win, by, increasing, their, level, of, effort, but, that, when, facing, a, superstar, competitor, extra, exertion, does, not, significantly, raise, one, s, level, of, winning, while, increasing, risk, of, injury, or, exhaustion, leading, to, reduced, effort, many, courses, in, the, pga, tour, rotation, including, major, championship, sites, like, augusta, national, have, added, yardage, to, their, tees, in, an, effort, to, reduce, the, advantage, of, long, hitters, like, woods, in, a, strategy, that, became, known, as, tiger, proofing, woods, said, he, welcomed, the, change, in, that, adding, yardage, to, courses, did, not, affect, his, ability, to, win, woods, has, won, 82, official, pga, tour, events, including, 15, majors, he, is, 14, 1, when, going, into, the, final, round, of, a, major, with, at, least, a, share, of, the, lead, multiple, golf, experts, have, heralded, woods, as, the, greatest, closer, in, history, he, has, the, lowest, career, scoring, average, and, the, largest, career, earnings, of, any, player, in, pga, tour, history, woods, s, victory, at, the, 2013, players, championship, also, marked, a, win, in, his, 300th, pga, tour, start, he, also, won, golf, tournaments, in, his, 100th, in, 2000, and, 200th, in, 2006, tour, starts, woods, has, spent, the, most, consecutive, and, cumulative, weeks, atop, the, world, rankings, he, is, one, of, five, players, along, with, gene, sarazen, ben, hogan, gary, player, and, jack, nicklaus, to, have, won, all, four, major, championships, in, his, career, known, as, the, career, grand, slam, and, was, the, youngest, to, do, so, woods, is,

the, world, of, golf, but, he, did, not, upgrade, his, equipment, in, the, following, years, he, insisted, upon, the, use, of, true, temper, dynamic, gold, steel, shafted, clubs, and, smaller, steel, clubheads, that, promoted, accuracy, over, distance, many, opponents, caught, up, to, him, and, phil, mickelson, even, made, a, joke, in, 2003, about, woods, using, inferior, equipment, which, did, not, sit, well, with, nike, titleist, or, woods, during, 2004, woods, finally, upgraded, his, driver, technology, to, a, larger, clubhead, and, graphite, shaft, which, coupled, with, his, clubhead, speed, again, made, him, one, of, the, tour, s, longest, players, off, the, tee, despite, his, power, advantage, woods, has, always, focused, on, developing, an, excellent, all, around, game, although, in, recent, years, he, has, typically, been, near, the, bottom, of, the, tour, rankings, in, driving, accuracy, his, iron, play, is, generally, accurate, his, recovery, and, bunker, play, is, very, strong, and, his, putting, especially, under, pressure, is, possibly, his, greatest, asset, he, is, largely, responsible, for, a, shift, to, higher, standards, of, athleticism, amongst, professional, golfers, and, is, known, for, utilizing, more, hours, of, practice, than, most, from, mid, 1993, while, he, was, still, an, amateur, until, 2004, woods, worked, almost, exclusively, with, leading, swing, coach, butch, harmon, from, mid, 1997, harmon, and, woods, fashioned, a, major, redevelopment, of, woods, s, full, swing, achieving, greater, consistency, better, distance,

1999, he, was, replaced, by, steve, williams, who, became, a, close, friend, of, woods, and, is, often, credited, with, helping, him, with, key, shots, and, putts, in, june, 2011, woods, dismissed, williams, after, he, caddied, for, adam, scott, in, the, u, s, open, and, replaced, him, with, friend, bryon, bell, on, an, interim, basis, joe, lacava, a, former, caddie, of, both, fred, couples,
