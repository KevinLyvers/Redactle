wearing, covered, shoes, also, previously, mitigated, in, 1432, that, particular, observance, distinguished, the, discalced, i, e, barefoot, followers, of, teresa, from, traditional, carmelites, and, they, would, be, formally, recognized, as, the, separate, order, of, discalced, carmelites, in, 1580, teresa, asked, john, to, delay, his, entry, into, the, carthusian, order, and, to, follow, her, having, spent, a, final, year, studying, in, salamanca, in, august, 1568, john, travelled, with, teresa, from, medina, to, valladolid, where, teresa, intended, to, found, another, convent, after, a, spell, at, teresa, s, side, in, valladolid, learning, more, about, the, new, form, of, carmelite, life, in, october, 1568, john, left, valladolid, accompanied, by, friar, antonio, de, jes, s, de, heredia, to, found, a, new, monastery, for, carmelite, friars, the, first, to, follow, teresa, s, principles, they, were, given, the, use, of, a, derelict, house, at, duruelo, which, had, been, donated, to, teresa, on, 28, november, 1568, the, monastery, was, established, and, on, that, same, day, john, changed, his, name, to, john, of, the, cross, soon, after, in, june, 1570, the, friars, found, the, house, at, duruelo, was, too, small, and, so, moved, to, the, nearby, town, of, mancera, de, abajo, midway, between, vila, and, salamanca, john, moved, from, the, first, community, to, set, up, a, new, community, at, pastrana, in, october, 1570, and, then, a, further, community, at, alcal, de, henares, as, a, house, for, the, academic, training, of, the, friars, in, 1572, he, arrived, in, vila, at, teresa, s, invitation, she, had, been, appointed, prioress, of, the, convent, of, the, incarnation, there, in, 1571, john, became, the, spiritual, director, and, confessor, of, teresa, and, the, other, 130, nuns, there, as, well, as, for, a, wide, range, of, laypeople, in, the, city, in, 1574, john, accompanied, teresa, for, the, foundation, of, a, new, religious, community, in, segovia, returning, to, vila, after, staying, there, a, week, aside, from, the, one, trip, john, seems, to, have, remained, in, vila, between, 1572, and, 1577, at, some, time, between, 1574, and, 1577, while, praying, in, a, loft, overlooking, the, sanctuary, in, the, monastery, of, the, incarnation, in, vila, john, had, a, vision, of, the, crucified, christ, which, led, him, to, create, his, drawing, of, christ, from, above, in, 1641, this, drawing, was, placed, in, a, small, monstrance, and, kept, in, vila, this, same, drawing, inspired, the, artist, salvador, dal, s, 1951, work, christ, of, saint, john, of, the, cross, the, years, 1575, 77, saw, a, great, increase, in, tensions, among, spanish, carmelite, friars, over, the, reforms, of, teresa, and, john, since, 1566, the, reforms, had, been, overseen, by, canonical, visitors, from, the, dominican, order, with, one, appointed, to, castile, and, a, second, to, andalusia, the, visitors, had, substantial, powers, they, could, move, members, of, religious, communities, from, one, house, to, another, or, from, one, province, to, the, next, they, could, assist, religious, superiors, in, the, discharge, of, their, office, and, could, delegate, superiors, between, the, dominican, or, carmelite, orders, in, castile, the, visitor, was, pedro, fern, ndez, who, prudently, balanced, the, interests, of, the, discalced, carmelites, with, those, of, the, nuns, and, friars, who, did, not, desire, reform, in, andalusia, to, the, south, the, visitor, was, francisco, vargas, and, tensions, rose, due, to, his, clear, preference, for, the, discalced, friars, vargas, asked, them, to, make, foundations, in, various, cities, in, contradiction, to, the, express, orders, from, the, carmelite, prior, general, to, curb, expansion, in, andalusia, as, a, result, a, general, chapter, of, the, carmelite, order, was, convened, at, piacenza, in, italy, in, may, 1576, out, of, concern, that, events, in, spain, were, getting, out, of, hand, it, concluded, by, ordering, the, total, suppression, of, the, discalced, houses, that, measure, was, not, immediately, enforced, king, philip, ii, of, spain, was, supportive, of, teresa, s, reforms, and, so, was, not, immediately, willing, to, grant, the, necessary, permission, to, enforce, the, ordinance, the, discalced, friars, also, found, support, from, the, papal, nuncio, to, spain, nicol, ormaneto, bishop, of, padua, who, still, had, ultimate, power, to, visit, and, reform, religious, orders, when, asked, by, the, discalced, friars, to, intervene, nuncio, ormaneto, replaced, vargas, as, visitor, of, the, carmelites, in, andalusia, with, jer, nimo, graci, n, a, priest, from, the, university, of, alcal, who, was, in, fact, a, discalced, carmelite, friar, himself, the, nuncio, s, protection, helped, john, avoid, problems, for, a, time, in, january, 1576, john, was, detained, in, medina, del, campo, by, traditional, carmelite, friars, but, through, the, nuncio, s, intervention, he, was, soon, released, when, ormaneto, died, on, 18, june, 1577, john, was, left, without, protection, and, the, friars, opposing, his, reforms, regained, the, upper, hand, on, the, night, of, 2, december, 1577, a, group, of, carmelites, opposed, to, reform, broke, into, john, s, dwelling, in, vila, and, took, him, prisoner, john, had, received, an, order, from, superiors, opposed, to, reform, to, leave, vila, and, return, to, his, original, house, john, had, refused, on, the, basis, that, his, reform, work, had, been, approved, by, the, papal, nuncio, to, spain, a, higher, authority, than, these, superiors, the, carmelites, therefore, took, john, captive, john, was, taken, from, vila, to, the, carmelite, monastery, in, toledo, at, that, time, the, order, s, leading, monastery, in, castile, with, a, community, of, 40, friars, john, was, brought, before, a, court, of, friars, accused, of, disobeying, the, ordinances, of, piacenza, despite, his, argument, that, he, had, not, disobeyed, the, ordinances, he, was, sentenced, to, a, term, of, imprisonment, he, was, jailed, in, a, monastery, where, he, was, kept, under, a, brutal, regime, that, included, public, lashings, before, the, community, at, least, weekly, and, severe, isolation, in, a, tiny, stifling, cell, measuring, barely, 10, by, 6, feet, 3, 0, by, 1, 8, m, except, when, rarely,

shorter, poems, the, paper, was, passed, to, him, by, the, friar, who, guarded, his, cell, he, managed, to, escape, eight, months, later, on, 15, august, 1578, through, a, small, window, in, a, room, adjoining, his, cell, he, had, managed, to, pry, open, the, hinges, of, the, cell, door, earlier, that, day, after, being, nursed, back, to, health, first, by, teresa, s, nuns, in, toledo, and, then, during, six, weeks, at, the, hospital, of, santa, cruz, john, continued, with, the, reforms, in, october, 1578, he, joined, a, meeting, at, almod, var, del, campo, of, reform, supporters, better, known, as, the, discalced, carmelites, there, in, part, as, a, result, of, the, opposition, faced, from, other, carmelites, they, decided, to, request, from, the, pope, their, formal, separation, from, the, rest, of, the, carmelite, order, at, that, meeting, john, was, appointed, superior, of, el, calvario, an, isolated, monastery, of, around, thirty, friars, in, the, mountains, about, 6,

designed, to, prevent, the, veneration, of, remains, without, official, approval, the, remains, were, buried, in, the, ground, in, the, 1930s, they, were, disinterred, and, are, now, sited, in, a, side, chapel, in, a, marble, case, above, a, special, altar, proceedings, to, beatify, john, began, between, 1614, and, 1616, he, was, eventually, beatified, in, 1675, by, pope, clement, x, and, was,

by, the, then, existing, octave, of, the, feast, of, the, immaculate, conception, this, obstacle, was, removed, in, 1955, and, in, 1969, pope, paul, vi, moved, it, to, the, dies, natalis, birthday, to, heaven, of, john, 14, december, the, church, of, england, and, the, episcopal, church, honor, him, on, the, same, date, in, 1926, he, was, declared, a, doctor, of, the, church, by, pope, pius, xi,

john, of, the, cross, is, considered, one, of, the, foremost, poets, in, spanish, although, his, complete, poems, add, up, to, fewer, than, 2, 500, verses, two, of, them, the, spiritual, canticle, and, the, dark, night, of, the, soul, are, widely, considered, masterpieces, of, spanish, poetry, both, for, their, formal, style, and, their, rich, symbolism, and, imagery, his, theological, works, often, consist, of, commentaries, on, the, poems, all, the, works, were, written, between, 1578, and, his, death, in, 1591, the, spiritual, canticle, is, an, eclogue, in, which, the, bride, representing, the, soul, searches, for, the, bridegroom, representing, jesus, christ, and, is, anxious, at, having, lost, him, both, are, filled, with, joy, upon, reuniting, it, can, be, seen, as, a, free, form, spanish, version, of, the, song, of, songs, at, a, time, when, vernacular, translations, of, the, bible, were, forbidden, the, first, 31, stanzas, of, the, poem, were, composed, in, 1578, while, john, was, imprisoned, in, toledo, after, his, escape, it, was, read, by, the, nuns, at, beas, who, made, copies, of, the, stanzas, over, the, following, years, john, added, further, lines, today, two, versions, exist, one, with, 39, stanzas, and, one, with, 40, with, some, of, the, stanzas, ordered, differently, the, first, redaction, of, the, commentary, on, the, poem, was, written, in, 1584, at, the, request, of, madre, ana, de, jes, s, when, she, was, prioress, of, the, discalced, carmelite, nuns, in, granada, a, second, edition, which, contains, more, detail, was, written, in, 1585, 6, the, dark, night, from, which, the, phrase, dark, night, of, the, soul, takes, its, name, narrates, the, journey, of, the, soul, from, its, bodily, home, to, union, with, god, it, happens, during, the, dark, which, represents, the, hardships, and, difficulties, met, in, detachment, from, the, world, and, reaching, the, light, of, the, union, with, the, creator, there, are, several, steps, during, the, state, of, darkness, which, are, described, in, successive, stanzas, the, main, idea, behind, the, poem, is, the, painful, experience, required, to, attain, spiritual, maturity, and, union, with, god, the, poem, was, likely, written, in, 1578, or, 1579, in, 1584, 5, john, wrote, a, commentary, on, the, first, two, stanzas, and, on, the, first, line, of, the, third, stanza, the, ascent, of, mount, carmel, is, a, more, systematic, study, of, the, ascetical, endeavour, of, a, soul, seeking, perfect, union, with, god, and, the, mystical, events, encountered, along, the, way, although, it, begins, as, a, commentary, on, the, dark, night, after, the, first, two, stanzas, of, the, poem, it, rapidly, diverts, into, a, full, treatise, it, was, composed, some, time, between, 1581, and, 1585, a, four, stanza, work, living, flame, of, love, describes, a, greater, intimacy, as, the, soul, responds, to, god, s, love, it, was, written, in, a, first, version, at, granada, between, 1585, and, 1586, apparently, in, two, weeks, and, in, a, mostly, identical, second, version, at, la, pe, uela, in, 1591, these, together, with, his, dichos, de, luz, y, amor, or, sayings, of, light, and, love, along, with, teresa, s, own, writings, are, the, most, important, mystical, works, in, spanish, and, have, deeply, influenced, later, spiritual, writers, across, the, world, they, include, t, s, eliot, th, r, se, de, lisieux, edith, stein, teresa, benedicta, of, the, cross, and, thomas, merton, john, is, said, to, have, also, influenced, philosophers, jacques, maritain, theologians, hans, urs, von, balthasar, pacifists, dorothy, day, daniel, berrigan, and, philip, berrigan, and, artists, salvador, dal, pope, john, paul, ii, wrote, his, theological, dissertation, on, the, mystical, theology, of, john, of, the, cross, his, writings, were, first, published, in, 1618, by, diego, de, salablanca, the, numerical, divisions, in, the, work, still, used, by, modern, editions, of, the, text, were, introduced, by, salablanca, they, were, not, in, john, s, original, writings, to, help, make, the, work, more, manageable, for, the, reader, this, edition, does, not, contain, the, spiritual, canticle, however, and, also, omits, or, adapts, certain, passages, perhaps, for, fear, of, falling, foul, of, the, inquisition, the, spiritual, canticle, was, first, included, in, the, 1630, edition, produced, by, fray, jeronimo, de, san, jos, at, madrid, this, edition, was, largely, followed, by, later, editors, although, editions, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, gradually, included, a, few, more, poems, and, letters, the, first, french, edition, was, published, in, paris, in, 1622, and, the, first, castilian, edition, in, 1627, in, brussels, a, critical, edition, of, john, s, works, in, english, was, published, by, e, allison, peers, in, 1935, the, influences, on, john, s, writing, are, subject, to, an, ongoing, debate, it, is, widely, acknowledged, that, at, salamanca, university, there, would, have, existed, a, range, of, intellectual, positions, in, john, s, time, they, included, the, influences, of, thomas, aquinas, of, scotus, and, of, durandus, it, is, often, assumed, that, john, would, have, absorbed, the, thought, of, aquinas, to, explain, the, scholastic, framework, of, his, writings, however, the, belief, that, john, was, taught, at, both, the, carmelite, college, of, san, andr, s, and, at, the, university, of, salamanca, has, been, challenged, bezares, calls, into, question, whether, john, even, studied, theology, at, the, university, of, salamanca, the, philosophy, courses, john, probably, took, in, logic, natural, and, moral, philosophy, can, be, reconstructed, but, bezares, argues, that, john, in, fact, abandoned, his, studies, at, salamanca, in, 1568, to, join, teresa, rather, than, graduating, in, the, first, biography, of, john, published, in, 1628, it, is, claimed, on, the, basis, of, information, from, john, s, fellow, students, that, he, in, 1567, made, a, special, study, of, mystical, writers, in, particular, of, pseudo, dionysius, and, pope, gregory, i, there, is, little, consensus, from, john, s, early, years, or, potential, influences, john, was, influenced, heavily, by, the, bible, scriptural, images, are, common, in, both, his, poems, and, prose, in, total, there, are, 1, 583, explicit, and, 115, implicit, quotations, from, the, bible, in, his, works, the, influence, of, the, song, of, songs, on, john, s, spiritual, canticle, has, often, been, noted, both, in, terms, of, the, structure, of, the, poem, with, its, dialogue, between, two, lovers, the, account, of, their, difficulties, in, meeting, each, other, and, the, offstage, chorus, that, comments, on, the, action, and, also, in, terms, of, the, imagery, for, example, of, pomegranates, wine, cellar, turtle, dove, and, lilies, which, echoes, that, of, the, song, of, songs, in, addition, john, shows, at, occasional, points, the, influence, of, the, divine, office, this, demonstrates, how, john, steeped, in, the, language, and, rituals, of, the, church, drew, at, times, on, the, phrases, and, language, here, it, has, rarely, been, disputed, that, the, overall, structure, of, john, s, mystical, theology, and, his, language, of, the, union, of, the, soul, with, god, is, influenced, by, the, pseudo, dionysian, tradition, however, it, has, not, been, clear, whether, john, might, have, had, direct, access, to, the, writings, of, pseudo, dionysius, or, whether, this, influence, may, have, been, mediated, through, various, later, authors, it, is, widely, acknowledged, that, john, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, writings, of, other, medieval, mystics, though, there, is, debate, about, the, exact, thought, which, may, have, influenced, him, and, about, how, he, might, have, been, exposed, to, their, ideas, the, possibility, of, influence, by, the, so, called, rhineland, mystics, such, as, meister, eckhart, johannes, tauler, henry, suso, and, john, of, ruysbroeck, has, also, been, mooted, by, many, authors, a, strong, argument, can, also, be, made, for, contemporary, spanish, literary, influences, on, john, this, case, was, first, made, in, detail, by, d, maso, alonso, who, believed, that, as, well, as, drawing, from, scripture, john, was, transforming, non, religious, profane, themes, derived, from, popular, songs, romanceros, into, religious, poetry, a, controversial, theory, on, the, origins, of, john, s, mystical, imagery, is, that, he, may, have, been, influenced, by, islamic, sources, this, was, first, proposed, in, detail, by, miguel, as, n, palacios, and, has, been, most, recently, put, forward, by, the, puerto, rican, scholar, luce, l, pez, baralt, arguing, that, john, was, influenced, by, islamic, sources, on, the, peninsula, she, traces, islamic, antecedents, of, the, images, of, the, dark, night, the, solitary, bird, of, the, spiritual, canticle, wine, and, mystical, intoxication, the, spiritual, canticle, lamps, of, fire, the, living, flame, however, peter, tyler, concludes, there, are, sufficient, christian, medieval, antecedents, for, many, of, the, metaphors, john, employs, to, suggest, we, should, look, for, christian, sources, rather, than, muslim, sources, as, jos, nieto, indicates, in, trying, to, locate, a, link, between, spanish, christian, mysticism, and, islamic, mysticism, it, might, make, more, sense, to, refer, to, the, common, neo, platonic, tradition, and, mystical, experiences, of, both, rather, than, seek, direct, influence
