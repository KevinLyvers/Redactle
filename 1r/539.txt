some, of, the, earliest, hard, bop, music, while, on, prestige, records, but, did, so, haphazardly, due, to, a, heroin, addiction, after, a, widely, acclaimed, comeback, performance, at, the, newport,

after, adding, saxophonist, wayne, shorter, to, his, new, quintet, in, 1964, davis, led, them, on, a, series, of, more, abstract, recordings, often, composed, by, the, band, members, helping, pioneer,

time, mentally, and, physically, stronger, and, joined, a, gym, he, informed, weinstock, and, blue, note, that, he, was, ready, to, record, with, a, quintet, which, he, was, granted, he, considered, the, albums, that, resulted, from, these, and, earlier, sessions, miles, davis, quartet, and, miles, davis, volume, 2, very, important, because, he, felt, his, performances, were, particularly,

pianist, like, jamal, and, chose, red, garland, blue, haze, 1956, bags, groove, 1957, walkin, 1957, and, miles, davis, and, the, modern, jazz, giants, 1959, documented, the, evolution, of, his, sound, with, the, harmon, mute, placed, close, to, the, microphone, and, the, use, of, more, spacious, and, relaxed, phrasing, he, assumed, a, central, role, in, hard, bop, less, radical, in, harmony, and, melody, and, used, popular, songs, and, american, standards, as, starting, points, for, improvisation, hard, bop, distanced, itself, from, cool, jazz, with, a, harder, beat, and, music, inspired, by, the, blues, a, few, critics, consider, walkin, april, 1954, the, album, that, created, the, hard, bop, genre, davis, gained, a, reputation, for, being, cold, distant, and, easily, angered, he, wrote, that, in, 1954, sugar, ray, robinson, was, the, most, important, thing, in, my, life, besides, music, and, he, adopted, robinson, s, arrogant, attitude, he, showed, contempt, for, critics, and, the, press, davis, had, an, operation, to, remove, polyps, from, his, larynx, in, october, 1955, the, doctors, told, him, to, remain, silent, after, the, operation, but, he, got, into, an, argument, that, permanently, damaged, his, vocal, cords, and, gave, him, a, raspy, voice, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, was, called, the, prince, of, darkness, adding, a, patina, of, mystery, to, his, public, persona, in, july, 1955, davis, s, fortunes, improved, considerably, when, he, played, at, the, newport, jazz, festival, with, a, lineup, of, monk, heath, drummer, connie, kay, and, horn, players, zoot, sims, and, gerry, mulligan, the, performance, was, praised, by, critics, and, audiences, alike, who, considered, it, to, be, a, highlight, of, the, festival, as, well, as, helping, davis, the,

influenced, davis, but, after, eight, months, of, touring, a, tired, evans, left, wynton, kelly, his, replacement, brought, to, the, group, a, swinging, style, that, contrasted, with, evans, s, delicacy, the, sextet, made, their, recording, debut, on, jazz, track, 1958, by, early, 1957, davis, was, exhausted, from, recording, and, touring, and, wished, to, pursue, new, projects, in, march,

stockhausen, leading, to, a, period, of, creative, exploration, biographer, j, k, chambers, wrote, the, effect, of, davis, study, of, stockhausen, could, not, be, repressed, for, long, davis, own, space, music, shows, stockhausen, s, influence, compositionally, his, recordings, and, performances, during, this, period, were, described, as, space, music, by, fans, feather, and, buckmaster, who, described, it, as, a, lot, of, mood, changes, heavy, dark, intense, definitely, space, music, the, studio, album, on, the, corner, 1972, blended, the, influence, of, stockhausen, and, buckmaster, with, funk, elements, davis, invited, buckmaster, to, new, york, city, to, oversee, the, writing, and, recording, of, the, album, with, macero, the, album, reached, no, 1, on, the, billboard, jazz, chart, but, peaked, at, no, 156, on, the, more, heterogeneous, top, 200, albums, chart, davis, felt, that, columbia, marketed, it, to, the, wrong, audience, the, music, was, meant, to, be, heard, by, young, black, people, but, they, just, treated, it, like, any, other, jazz, album, and, advertised, it, that, way, pushed, it, on, the, jazz, radio, stations, young, black, kids, don, t, listen, to, those, stations, they, listen, to, r, b, stations, and, some, rock, stations, in, october, 1972, he, broke, his, ankles, in, a, car, crash, he, took, painkillers, and, cocaine, to, cope, with, the,

garnett, guitarist, reggie, lucas, organist, lonnie, liston, smith, tabla, player, badal, roy, sitarist, khalil, balakrishna, and, drummer, al, foster, only, smith, was, a, jazz, instrumentalist, consequently, the, music, emphasized, rhythmic, density, and, shifting, textures, instead, of, solos, this, group, was, recorded, live, in, 1972, for, in, concert, but, davis, found, it, unsatisfactory, leading, him, to, drop, the, tabla, and, sitar, and, play, keyboards, he, also, added, guitarist, pete, cosey, the, compilation, studio, album, big, fun, contains, four, long, improvisations, recorded, between, 1969, and, 1972, this, was, music, that, polarized, audiences, provoking, boos, and, walk, outs, amid, the, ecstasy, of, others, the, length, density, and, unforgiving, nature, of, it, mocked, those, who, said, that, miles, was, interested, only, in, being, trendy, and, popular, some, have, heard, in, this, music, the, feel, and, shape, of, a, musician, s, late, work, an, egoless, music, that, precedes, its, creator, s, death, as, theodor, adorno, said, of, the, late, beethoven, the, disappearance, of, the, musician, into, the, work, is, a, bow, to, mortality, it, was, as, if, miles, were, testifying, to, all, that, he, had, been, witness, to, for, the, past, thirty, years, both, terrifying, and, joyful, john, szwed, on, agharta, 1975, and, pangaea, 1976, studio, sessions, throughout, 1973, and, 1974, led, to, get, up, with, it, an, album, which, included, four, long, pieces, alongside, four, shorter, recordings, from, 1970, and, 1972, the, track, he, loved, him, madly, a, thirty, minute, tribute, to, the, recently, deceased, duke, ellington, influenced, brian, eno, s, ambient, music, in, the, united, states, it, performed, comparably, to, on, the, corner, reaching, number, 8, on, the, jazz, chart, and, number, 141, on, the, pop, chart, he, then, concentrated, on, live, performance, with, a, series, of, concerts, that, columbia, released, on, the, double, live, albums, agharta, 1975, pangaea, 1976, and, dark, magus, 1977, the, first, two, are, recordings, of, two, sets, from, february, 1, 1975, in, osaka, by, which, time, davis, was, troubled, by, several, physical, ailments, he, relied, on, alcohol, codeine, and, morphine, to, get, through, the, engagements, his, shows, were, routinely, panned, by, critics, who, mentioned, his, habit, of, performing, with, his, back, to, the, audience, cosey, later, asserted, that, the, band, really, advanced, after, the, japanese, tour, but, davis, was, again, hospitalized, for, his, ulcers, and, a, hernia, during, a, tour, of, the, us, while, opening, for, herbie, hancock, after, appearances, at, the, 1975, newport, jazz, festival, in, july, and, the, schaefer, music, festival, in, new, york, in, september, davis, dropped, out, of, music, in, his, autobiography, davis, wrote, frankly, about, his, life, during, his, hiatus, from, music, he, called, his, upper, west, side, brownstone, a, wreck, and, chronicled, his, heavy, use, of, alcohol, and, cocaine, in, addition, to, sexual, encounters, with, many, women, he, also, stated, that, sex, and, drugs, took, the, place, music, had, occupied, in, my, life, drummer, tony, williams, recalled, that, by, noon, on, average, davis, would, be, sick, from, the, previous, night, s, intake, in, december, 1975, he, had, regained, enough, strength, to, undergo, a, much, needed, hip, replacement, operation, in, december, 1976, columbia, was, reluctant, to, renew, his, contract, and, pay, his, usual, large, advances, but, after, his, lawyer, started, negotiating, with, united, artists, columbia, matched, their, offer, establishing, the, miles, davis, fund, to, pay, him, regularly, pianist, vladimir, horowitz, was, the, only, other, musician, with, columbia, who, had, a, similar, status, in, 1978, davis, asked, fusion, guitarist, larry, coryell, to, participate, in, sessions, with, keyboardists, masabumi,

explained, his, reasons, for, not, wishing, to, perform, his, earlier, works, such, as, birth, of, the, cool, or, kind, of, blue, in, his, view, remaining, stylistically, static, was, the, wrong, option, he, commented, so, what, or, kind, of, blue, they, were, done, in, that, era, the, right, hour, the, right, day, and, it, happened, it, s, over, what, i, used, to, play, with, bill, evans, all, those, different, modes, and, substitute, chords, we, had, the, energy, then, and, we, liked, it, but, i, have, no, feel, for, it, anymore, it, s, more, like, warmed, over, turkey, when, shirley,

kind, of, blue, said, i, would, like, to, hear, more, of, the, consummate, melodic, master, but, i, feel, that, big, business, and, his, record, company, have, had, a, corrupting, influence, on, his,

documentaries, focus, on, his, work, before, 1975, according, to, an, article, by, the, independent, from, 1975, onwards, a, decline, in, critical, praise, for, davis, s, output, began, to, form, with, many, viewing, the, era, as, worthless, there, is, a, surprisingly, widespread, view, that, in, terms, of, the, merits, of, his, musical, output, davis, might, as, well, have, died, in, 1975, in, a, 1982, interview, in, downbeat, wynton, marsalis, said, they, call, miles, s, stuff, jazz, that, stuff, is, not, jazz, man, just, because, somebody, played, jazz, at, one, time, that, doesn, t, mean, they, re, still, playing, it, despite, his, contempt, for, davis, later, work, marsalis, work, is, laden, with, ironic, references, to, davis, music, of, the, 60s, davis, did, not, necessarily, disagree, lambasting, what, he, saw, as, marsalis, s, stylistic, conservatism, davis, said, jazz, is, dead, it, s, finito, it, s, over, and, there, s, no, point, apeing, the, shit, writer, stanley,

stylistic, development, in, the, music, during, that, period, it, can, even, be, argued, that, jazz, stopped, evolving, when, davis, wasn, t, there, to, push, it, forward, francis, davis, of, the, atlantic, noted, that, davis, s, career, can, be, seen, as, an, ongoing, critique, of, bebop, the, origins, of, cool, jazz, hard, bop, or, funky, modal, improvisation, and, jazz, rock, fusion, can, be, traced, to, his, efforts, to, tear, bebop, down, to, its, essentials, his, approach, owing, largely, to, the, african, american, performance, tradition, that, focused, on, individual, expression, emphatic, interaction, and, creative, response, to, shifting, contents, had, a, profound, impact, on, generations, of, jazz, musicians, in, 2016, digital, publication, the, pudding, in, an, article,
