dom, henrique, of, portugal, duke, of, viseu, 4, march, 1394, 13, november, 1460, better, known, as, prince, henry, the, navigator, portuguese, infante, dom, henrique, o, navegador, was, a, central, figure, in, the, early, days, of, the, portuguese, empire, and, in, the, 15th, century, european, maritime, discoveries, and, maritime, expansion, through, his, administrative, direction, he, is, regarded, as, the, main, initiator, of, what, would, be, known, as, the, age, of, discovery, henry, was, the, fourth, child, of, king, john, i, of, portugal, who, founded, the, house, of, aviz, after, procuring, the, new, caravel, ship, henry, was, responsible, for, the, early, development, of, portuguese, exploration, and, maritime, trade, with, other, continents, through, the, systematic, exploration, of, western, africa, the, islands, of, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, search, for, new, routes, he, encouraged, his, father, to, conquer, ceuta, 1415, the, muslim, port, on, the, north, african, coast, across, the, straits, of, gibraltar, from, the, iberian, peninsula, he, learned, of, the, opportunity, offered, by, the, saharan, trade, routes, that, terminated, there, and, became, fascinated, with, africa, in, general, he, was, most, intrigued, by, the, christian, legend, of, prester, john, and, the, expansion, of, portuguese, trade, he, is, regarded, as, the, patron, of, portuguese, exploration, henry, was, the, third, surviving, son, of, king, john, i, and, his, wife, philippa, sister, of, king, henry, iv, of, england, he, was, baptized, in, porto, and, may, have, been, born, there, probably, when, the, royal, couple, was, living, in, the, city, s, old, mint, now, called, casa, do, infante, prince, s, house, or, in, the, region, nearby, another, possibility, is, that, he, was, born, at, the, monastery, of, le, a, do, balio, in, le, a, da, palmeira, during, the, same, period, of, the, royal, couple, s, residence, in, the, city, of, porto, henry, was, 21, when, he, his, father, and, brothers, captured, the, moorish, port, of, ceuta, in, northern, morocco, ceuta, had, long, been, a, base, for, barbary, pirates, who, raided, the, portuguese, coast, depopulating, villages, by, capturing, their, inhabitants, to, be, sold, in, the, african, slave, trade, following, this, success, henry, began, to, explore, the, coast, of, africa, most, of, which, was, unknown, to, europeans, his, objectives, included, finding, the, source, of, the, west, african, gold, trade, and, the, legendary, christian, kingdom, of, prester, john, and, stopping, the, pirate, attacks, on, the, portuguese, coast, at, that, time, the, cargo, ships, of, the, mediterranean, were, too, slow, and, heavy, to, undertake, such, voyages, under, henry, s, direction, a, new, and, much, lighter, ship, was, developed, the, caravel, which, could, sail, farther, and, faster, above, all, it, was, highly, maneuverable, and, could, sail, into, the, wind, making, it, largely, independent, of, the, prevailing, winds, the, caravel, used, the, lateen, sail, the, prevailing, rig, in, christian, mediterranean, navigation, since, late, antiquity, with, this, ship, portuguese, mariners, freely, explored, uncharted, waters, around, the, atlantic, from, rivers, and, shallow, waters, to, transoceanic, voyages, in, 1419, henry, s, father, appointed, him, governor, of, the, province, of, the, algarve, on, may, 25, 1420, henry, gained, appointment, as, the, governor, of, the, military, order, of, christ, the, portuguese, successor, to, the, knights, templar, which, had, its, headquarters, at, tomar, in, central, portugal, henry, held, this, position, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, and, the, order, was, an, important, source, of, funds, for, henry, s, ambitious, plans, especially, his, persistent, attempts, to, conquer, the, canary, islands, which, the, portuguese, had, claimed, to, have, discovered, before, the, year, 1346, in, 1425, his, second, brother, the, infante, peter, duke, of, coimbra, made, a, diplomatic, tour, of, europe, with, an, additional, charge, from, henry, to, seek, out, geographic, material, peter, returned, with, a, current, world, map, from, venice, in, 1431, henry, donated, houses, for, the, estudo, geral, to, teach, all, the, sciences, grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, music, and, astronomy, in, what, would, later, become, the, university, of, lisbon, for, other, subjects, like, medicine, or, philosophy, he, ordered, that, each, room, should, be, decorated, according, to, the, subject, taught, henry, also, had, other, resources, when, john, i, died, in, 1433, henry, s, eldest, brother, edward, of, portugal, became, king, he, granted, henry, all, profits, from, trading, within, the, areas, he, discovered, as, well, as, the, sole, right, to, authorize, expeditions, beyond, cape, bojador, henry, also, held, a, monopoly, on, tuna, fishing, in, the, algarve, when, edward, died, eight, years, later, henry, supported, his, brother, peter, duke, of, coimbra, for, the, regency, during, the, minority, of, edward, s, son, afonso, v, and, in, return, received, a, confirmation, of, this, levy, henry, functioned, as, a, primary, organizer, of, the, disastrous, expedition, to, tangier, in, 1437, against, ala, ben, ala, which, ended, in, henry, s, younger, brother, ferdinand, being, given, as, hostage, to, guarantee, portuguese, promises, in, the, peace, agreement, the, portuguese, cortes, refused, to, return, ceuta, as, ransom, for, ferdinand, who, remained, in, captivity, until, his, death, six, years, later, prince, regent, peter, supported, portuguese, maritime, expansion, in, the, atlantic, ocean, and, africa, and, henry, promoted, the, colonization, of, the, azores, during, peter, s, regency, 1439, 1448, for, most, of, the, latter, part, of, his, life, henry, concentrated, on, his, maritime, activities, and, court, politics, according, to, jo, o, de, barros, in, algarve, prince, henry, the, navigator, repopulated, a, village, that, he, called, ter, anabal, from, ter, a, nabal, or, tercena, nabal, this, village, was, situated, in, a, strategic, position, for, his, maritime, enterprises, and, was, later, called, vila, do, infante, estate, or, town, of, the, prince, it, is, traditionally, suggested, that, henry, gathered, at, his, villa, on, the, sagres, peninsula, a, school, of, navigators, and, map, makers, however, modern, historians, hold, this, to, be, a, misconception, he, did, employ, some, cartographers, to, chart, the, coast, of, mauritania, after, the, voyages, he, sent, there, but, there, was, no, center, of, navigation, science, or, observatory, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, nor, was, there, an, organized, navigational, center, referring, to, sagres, sixteenth, century, portuguese, mathematician, and, cosmographer, pedro, nunes, remarked, from, it, our, sailors, went, out, well, taught, and, provided, with, instruments, and, rules, which, all, map, makers, and, navigators, should, know, the, view, that, henry, s, court, rapidly, grew, into, the, technological, base, for, exploration, with, a, naval, arsenal, and, an, observatory, etc, although, repeated, in, popular, culture, has, never, been, established, henry, did, possess, geographical, curiosity, and, employed, cartographers, jehuda, cresques, a, noted, cartographer, has, been, said, to, have, accepted, an, invitation, to, come, to, portugal, to, make, maps, for, the, infante, prestage, makes, the, argument, that, the, presence, of, the, latter, at, the, prince, s, court, probably, accounts, for, the, legend, of, the, school, of, sagres, which, is, now, discredited, henry, sponsored, voyages, collecting, a, 20, tax, o, quinto, on, profits, the, usual, practice, in, the, iberian, states, at, the, time, the, nearby, port, of, lagos, provided, a, convenient, home, port, for, these, expeditions, the, voyages, were, made, in, very, small, ships, mostly, the, caravel, a, light, and, maneuverable, vessel, equipped, by, lateen, sails, most, of, the, voyages, sent, out, by, henry, consisted, of, one, or, two, ships, that, navigated, by, following, the, coast, stopping, at, night, to, tie, up, along, some, shore, during, prince, henry, s, time, and, after, the, portuguese, navigators, discovered, and, perfected, the, north, atlantic, volta, do, mar, the, turn, of, the, sea, or, return, from, the, sea, the, dependable, pattern, of, trade, winds, blowing, largely, from, the, east, near, the, equator, and, the, returning, westerlies, in, the, mid, atlantic, this, was, a, major, step, in, the, history, of, navigation, when, an, understanding, of, oceanic, wind, patterns, was, crucial, to, atlantic, navigation, from, africa, and, the, open, ocean, to, europe, and, enabled, the, main, route, between, the, new, world, and, europe, in, the, north, atlantic, in, future, voyages, of, discovery, although, the, lateen, sail, allowed, sailing, upwind, to, some, extent, it, was, worth, even, major, extensions, of, course, to, have, a, faster, and, calmer, following, wind, for, most, of, a, journey, portuguese, mariners, who, sailed, south, and, southwest, towards, the, canary, islands, and, west, africa, would, afterwards, sail, far, to, the, northwest, that, is, away, from, continental, portugal, and, seemingly, in, the, wrong, direction, before, turning, northeast, near, the, azores, islands, and, finally, east, to, europe, in, order, to, have, largely, following, winds, for, their, full, journey, christopher, columbus, used, this, on, his, transatlantic, voyages, the, first, explorations, followed, not, long, after, the, capture, of, ceuta, in, 1415, henry, was, interested, in, locating, the, source, of, the, caravans, that, brought, gold, to, the, city, during, the, reign, of, his, father, john, i, jo, o, gon, alves, zarco, and, trist, o, vaz, teixeira, were, sent, to, explore, along, the, african, coast, zarco, a, knight, in, service, to, prince, henry, had, commanded, the, caravels, guarding, the, coast, of, algarve, from, the, incursions, of, the, moors, he, had, also, been, at, ceuta, in, 1418, zarco, and, teixeira, were, blown, off, course, by, a, storm, while, making, the, volta, do, mar, westward, swing, to, return, to, portugal, they, found, shelter, at, an, island, they, named, porto, santo, henry, directed, that, porto, santo, be, colonized, the, move, to, claim, the, madeiran, islands, was, probably, a, response, to, castile, s, efforts, to, claim, the, canary, islands, in, 1420, settlers, then, moved, to, the, nearby, island, of, madeira, a, chart, drawn, by, the, catalan, cartographer, gabriel, de, vallseca, of, mallorca, has, been, interpreted, to, indicate, that, the, azores, were, first, discovered, by, diogo, de, silves, in, 1427, in, 1431, gon, alo, velho, was, dispatched, with, orders, to, determine, the, location, of, islands, first, identified, by, de, silves, velho, apparently, got, as, far, as, the, formigas, in, the, eastern, archipelago, before, having, to, return, to, sagres, probably, due, to, bad, weather, by, this, time, the, portuguese, navigators, had, also, reached, the, sargasso, sea, western, north, atlantic, region, naming, it, after, the, sargassum, seaweed, growing, there, sarga, o, sargasso, in, portuguese, in, 1424, cape, bojador, was, the, most, southerly, point, known, to, europeans, on, the, west, coast, of, africa, for, centuries, superstitious, seafarers, held, that, beyond, the, cape, lay, sea, monsters, and, the, edge, of, the, world, however, prince, henry, was, determined, to, know, the, truth, he, was, persistent, and, sent, 15, expeditions, over, a, ten, year, period, to, pass, the, dreaded, cape, each, returned, unsuccessful, the, captains, gave, various, excuses, for, having, failed, finally, in, 1434, gil, eanes, the, commander, of, one, of, henry, s, expeditions, became, the, first, known, european, to, pass, cape, bojador, since, hanno, almost, two, millennium, before, using, the, new, ship, type, the, expeditions, then, pushed, onwards, nuno, trist, o, and, ant, o, gon, alves, reached, cape, blanco, in, 1441, the, portuguese, sighted, the, bay, of, arguin, in, 1443, and, built, an, important, forte, feitoria, a, fort, protecting, a, trading, post, on, the, island, of, arguin, around, the, year, 1448, dinis, dias, soon, came, across, the, senegal, river, and, rounded, the, peninsula, of, cap, vert, in, 1444, by, this, stage, the, explorers, had, passed, the, southern, boundary, of, the, desert, and, from, then, on, henry, had, one, of, his, wishes, fulfilled, the, portuguese, had, circumvented, the, muslim, land, based, trade, routes, across, the, western, sahara, desert, and, slaves, and, gold, began, arriving, in, portugal, this, rerouting, of, trade, devastated, algiers, and, tunis, but, made, portugal, rich, by, 1452, the, influx, of, gold, permitted, the, minting, of, portugal, s, first, gold, cruzado, coins, a, cruzado, was, equal, to, 400, reis, at, the, time, from, 1444, to, 1446, as, many, as, forty, vessels, sailed, from, lagos, on, henry, s, behalf, and, the, first, private, mercantile, expeditions, began, alvise, cadamosto, explored, the, atlantic, coast, of, africa, and, discovered, several, islands, of, the, cape, verde, archipelago, between, 1453, and, 1456, in, his, first, voyage, which, started, on, 22, march, 1455, he, visited, the, madeira, islands, and, the, canary, islands, on, the, second, voyage, in, 1456, cadamosto, became, the, first, european, to, reach, the, cape, verde, islands, ant, nio, noli, later, claimed, the, credit, by, 1462, the, portuguese, had, explored, the, coast, of, africa, as, far, as, present, day, sierra, leone, twenty, eight, years, later, bartolomeu, dias, proved, that, africa, could, be, circumnavigated, when, he, reached, the, southern, tip, of, the, continent, now, known, as, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1498, vasco, da, gama, became, the, first, european, sailor, to, reach, india, by, sea, no, one, used, the, nickname, henry, the, navigator, to, refer, to, prince, henry, during, his, lifetime, or, in, the, following, three, centuries, the, term, was, coined, by, two, nineteenth, century, german, historians, heinrich, schaefer, and, gustave, de, veer, later, on, it, was, made, popular, by, two, british, authors, who, included, it, in, the, titles, of, their, biographies, of, the, prince, henry, major, in, 1868, and, raymond, beazley, in, 1895, contrary, to, his, brothers, prince, henry, was, not, praised, for, his, intellectual, gifts, by, his, contemporaries, it, was, only, later, chroniclers, such, as, jo, o, de, barros, and, dami, o, de, g, is, who, attributed, him, a, scholarly, character, and, an, interest, for, cosmography, the, myth, of, the, sagres, school, allegedly, founded, by, prince, henry, was, created, in, the, 18th, century, mainly, by, samuel, purchas, and, abb, pr, vost, in, nineteenth, century, portugal, the, idealized, vision, of, prince, henry, as, a, putative, pioneer, of, exploration, and, science, reached, its, apogee, henry, is, depicted, in, the, monument, of, the, discoveries, located, in, lisbon, featured, in, the, front, of, the, monument, in, 1994, the, prince,
