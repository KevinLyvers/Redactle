sultan, avoiding, the, divan, had, been, introduced, as, long, ago, as, the, reign, of, suleiman, i, and, was, considered, one, of, the, causes, of, the, decline, of, the, empire, by, a, turkish, historian, nearly, two, centuries, before, mahmud, ii, s, time, mahmud, ii, also, addressed, some, of, the, worst, abuses, connected, with, the, vak, fs, by, placing, their, revenues, under, state, administration, however, he, did, not, venture, to, apply, this, vast, mass, of, property, to, the, general, purposes, of, the, government, his, modernizations, included, the, relaxation, of, much, of, the, restrictions, on, alcoholic, beverages, in, the, empire, and, the, sultan, himself, was, known, to, drink, socially, with, his, ministers, by, the, end, of, his, reign, his, reforms, had, mostly, normalized, drinking, among, the, upper, classes, and, political, figures, in, the, empire, the, financial, situation, of, the, empire, was, troubling, during, his, reign, and, certain, social, classes, had, long, been, under, the, oppression, of, heavy, taxes, in, dealing, with, the, complicated, questions, that, therefore, arose, mahmud, ii, is, considered, to, have, demonstrated, the, best, spirit, of, the, best, of, the, k, pr, l, s, a, firma, dated, 22, february, 1834, abolished, the, vexatious, charges, which, public, functionaries, when, traversing, the, provinces, had, long, been, accustomed, to, take, from, the, inhabitants, by, the, same, edict, all, collection, of, money, except, for, the, two, regular, half, yearly, periods, was, denounced, as, abuses, no, one, is, ignorant, said, sultan, mahmud, ii, in, this, document, that, i, am, bound, to, afford, support, to, all, my, subjects, against, vexatious, proceedings, to, endeavour, unceasingly, to, lighten, instead, of, increasing, their, burdens, and, to, ensure, peace, and, tranquility, therefore, those, acts, of, oppression, are, at, once, contrary, to, the, will, of, god, and, to, my, imperial, orders, the, hara, or, capitation, tax, though, moderate, and, exempting, those, who, paid, it, from, military, service, had, long, been, made, an, engine, of, gross, tyranny, through, the, insolence, and, misconduct, of, the, government, collectors, the, firman, of, 1834, abolished, the, old, mode, of, levying, it, and, ordained, that, it, should, be, raised, by, a, commission, composed, of, the,

the, administrative, government, was, simplified, and, strengthened, and, a, large, number, of, sinecure, offices, were, abolished, sultan, mahmud, ii, provided, a, valuable, personal, example, of, good, sense, and, economy, organising, the, imperial, household, suppressing, all, titles, without, duties, and, all, salaried, officials, without, functions, mahmud, ii, dealt, effectively, with, the, military, fiefs, the, t, mar, s, and, the, ziamet, s, these, had, been, instituted, to, furnish, the, old, effective, military, force, but, had, long, ceased, to, serve, this, purpose, by, attaching, them, to, the, public, domains, mahmud, ii, materially, strengthened, the, resources, of, the, state, and, put, an, end, to, a, host, of, corruptions, one, of, the, most, resolute, acts, of, his, ruling, was, the, suppression, of, the, dere, beys, the, hereditary, local, chiefs, with, power, to, nominate, their, successors, in, default, of, male, heirs, which, in, one, of, the, worst, abuses, of, the, ottoman, feudal, system, had, made, themselves, petty, princes, in, almost, every, province, of, the, empire, the, reduction, of, these, insubordinate, feudatories, was, not, affected, at, once, or, without, severe, struggles, and, frequent, rebellions, mahmud, ii, steadily, persevered, in, this, great, measure, and, ultimately, the, island, of, cyprus, became, the, only, part, of, the, empire, in, which, power, that, was, not, emanating, from, the, sultan, was, allowed, to, be, retained, by, dere, beys, one, of, his, most, notable, achievement, was, the, abolition, through, use, of, military, force, execution, and, exile, and, banning, of, the, bektashi, order, of, the, janissary, corps, event, known, as, the, auspicious, incident, in, 1826, and, the, establishment, of, a, modern, ottoman, army, named, the, asakir, i, mansure, i, muhammediye, meaning, victorious, soldiers, of, muhammad, in, ottoman, turkish, following, the, loss, of, greece, after, the, battle, of, navarino, against, the, combined, british, french, russian, flotilla, in, 1827, mahmud, ii, gave, top, priority, to, rebuilding, a, strong, ottoman, naval, force, the, first,

arsenal, ters, ne, i, mire, on, the, golden, horn, in, constantinople, kadem, which, translates, as, foot, is, often, misinterpreted, as, equivalent, in, length, to, one, imperial, foot, hence, the, wrongly, converted, dimensions, of, 201, x, 56, ft, or, 62, x, 17, m, in, some, sources, during, his, reign, mahmud, ii, also, made, sweeping, reforms, of, the, bureaucracy, in, order, to, reestablish, royal, authority, and, increase, the, administrative, efficiency, of, his, government, this, was, accomplished, by, abolishing, old, offices, introducing, new, lines, of, responsibility,

servants, clothing, was, also, an, essential, aspect, of, mahmud, ii, s, reforms, he, began, by, officially, adopting, the, fez, for, the, military, after, the, janissary, eradication, in, 1826, which, signified, a, break, from, the, old, style, of, military, dress, on, top, of, this, he, ordered, civilian, officials, to, also, adopt, a, similar, but, plain, fez, to, distinguish, them, from, the, military, he, planned, for, the, population, to, adopt, this, as, well, as, he, desired, a, homogeneous, look, for, ottoman, society, with, an, 1829, regulatory, law, unlike, past, sultanic, clothing, decrees, and, those, of, other, societies, mahmud, ii, wanted, all, levels, of, government, and, civilians, to, look, the, same, he, faced, significant, resistance, to, these, measures, specifically, from, religious, groups, laborers, and, military, members, because, of, traditional, religious, and, practical, reasons, mahmud, ii, s, portraits, also, give, a, valuable, insight, into, his, clothing, mentality, as, he, switched, to, a, more, european, style, and, fez, after, 1826, on, top, of, these, reforms, mahmud, ii, was, also, critical, in, the, establishment, and, flourishing,

resumed, selim, s, efforts, to, create, a, system, of, permanent, diplomatic, representation, in, europe, in, 1834, permanent, european, embassies, were, established, with, the, first, being, in, paris, despite, the, difficulties, that, came, along, with, these, actions, the, expansion, of, diplomacy, increased, the, transmission, of, ideas, that, would, have, a, revolutionary, effect, on, the, development, of, bureaucracy, and, ottoman, society, as, a, whole, mahmud, ii, had, at, least, nineteen, consorts, mahmud, had, at, least, eighteen, sons, of, which, only, two, lived, to,
