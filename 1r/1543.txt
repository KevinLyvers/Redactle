his, wife, elizabeth, bird, 1730, 1798, his, grandfather, william, 1690, 1774, had, made, the, family, fortune, in, the, maritime, trade, with, baltic, countries, he, was, twice, elected, mayor, of,

would, become, a, lifelong, friend, wilberforce, profited, from, the, supportive, atmosphere, at, the, school, until, his, father, died, in, 1768, with, his, mother, struggling, to, cope, the, nine,

putney, for, two, years, and, spent, his, holidays, in, wimbledon, where, he, grew, extremely, fond, of, his, relatives, he, became, interested, in, evangelical, christianity, due, to, his, relatives, influence, especially, that, of, his, aunt, hannah, sister, of, the, wealthy, merchant, john, thornton, a, philanthropist, and, a, supporter, of, the, leading, methodist, preacher, george, whitefield, wilberforce, s, staunchly, church, of, england, mother, and, grandfather, alarmed, at, these, nonconformist, influences, and, at, his, leanings, towards, evangelicalism, brought, the, 12, year, old, boy, back, to, hull, in, 1771, wilberforce, was, heartbroken, at, being, separated, from, his, aunt, and, uncle, his, family, opposed, a, return, to, hull, grammar, school, because, the, headmaster, had, become, a, methodist, and, wilberforce, continued, his, education, at, pocklington, school, from, 1771, to, 1776, influenced, by, methodist, scruples, he, initially, resisted, hull, s, lively, social, life, but, as, his, religious, fervour, diminished, he, embraced, theatre, going, attended, balls, and, played, cards, in, october, 1776, at, the, age, of, seventeen, wilberforce, went, up, to, st, john, s, college, cambridge, the, deaths, of, his, grandfather, and, uncle, in, 1774, and, 1777, respectively, had, left, him, independently, wealthy, and, as, a, result, he, had, little, inclination, or, need, to, apply, himself, to, serious, study, instead, he, immersed, himself, in, the, social, round, of, student, life, and, pursued, a, hedonistic, lifestyle, enjoying, cards, gambling, and, late, night, drinking, sessions, although, he, found, the, excesses, of, some, of, his, fellow, students, distasteful, witty, generous, and, an, excellent, conversationalist, wilberforce, was, a, popular, figure, he, made, many, friends, including, the, more, studious, future, prime, minister, william, pitt, despite, his, lifestyle, and, lack, of, interest, in, studying, he, managed, to, pass, his, examinations, and, was, awarded, a, bachelor, of, arts, degree, in, 1781, and, a, master, of, arts, degree, in, 1788, wilberforce, began, to, consider, a, political, career, while, still, at, university, and, during, the, winter, of, 1779, 1780, he, and, pitt, frequently, watched, house, of, commons, debates, from, the, gallery, pitt, already, set, on, a, political, career, encouraged, wilberforce, to, join, him, in, obtaining, a, parliamentary, seat, in, september, 1780, at, the, age, of, 21, and, while, still, a, student, wilberforce, was, elected, member, of, parliament, for, kingston, upon, hull, spending, over, 8, 000, as, was, the, custom, of, the, time, to, ensure, he, received, the, necessary, votes, free, from, financial, pressures, wilberforce, sat, as, an, independent, resolving, to, be, no, party, man, criticised, at, times, for, inconsistency, he, supported, both, tory, and, whig, governments, according, to, his, conscience, working, closely, with, the, party, in, power, and, voting, on, specific, measures, according, to, their, merits, wilberforce, attended, parliament, regularly, but, he, also, maintained, a, lively, social, life, becoming, an, habitu, of, gentlemen, s, gambling, clubs, such, as, goostree, s, and, boodle, s, in, pall, mall, london, the, writer, and, socialite, madame, de, sta, l, described, him, as, the, wittiest, man, in, england, and, according, to, georgiana, duchess, of, devonshire, the, prince, of, wales, said, that, he, would, go, anywhere, to, hear, wilberforce, sing, wilberforce, used, his, speaking, voice, to, great, effect, in, political, speeches, the, diarist, and, author, james, boswell, witnessed, wilberforce, s, eloquence, in, the, house, of, commons, and, noted, i, saw, what, seemed, a, mere, shrimp, mount, upon, the, table, but, as, i, listened, he, grew, and, grew, until, the, shrimp, became, a, whale, during, the, frequent, government, changes, of, 1781, 1784, wilberforce, supported, his, friend, pitt, in, parliamentary, debates, in, autumn, 1783, pitt, wilberforce, and, edward, eliot, travelled, to, france, for, a, six, week, holiday, together, after, a, difficult, start, in, rheims, where, their, presence, aroused, police, suspicion, that, they, were, english, spies, they, visited, paris, meeting, benjamin, franklin, general, lafayette, marie, antoinette, and, louis, xvi, and, joined, the, french, court, at, fontainebleau, pitt, became, prime, minister, in, december, 1783, with, wilberforce, a, key, supporter, of, his, minority, government, despite, their, close, friendship, there, is, no, record, that, pitt, offered, wilberforce, a, ministerial, position, in, this, or, future, governments, this, may, have, been, due, to, wilberforce, s, wish, to, remain, an, independent, mp, alternatively, wilberforce, s, frequent, tardiness, and, disorganisation, as, well, as, his, chronic, eye, problems, that, at, times, made, reading, impossible, may, have, convinced, pitt, that, he, was, not, ministerial, material, when, parliament, was, dissolved, in, the, spring, of, 1784, wilberforce, decided, to, stand, as, a, candidate, for, the, county, of, yorkshire, in, the, 1784, general, election, on, 6, april, he, was, returned, as, mp, for, yorkshire, at, the, age, of, twenty, four, in, october, 1784, wilberforce, embarked, upon, a, tour, of, europe, with, his, mother, sister, and, isaac, milner, the, younger, brother, of, his, former, headmaster, they, visited, the, french, riviera, and, had, dinners, played, cards, and, gambled, in, february, 1785, wilberforce, returned, to, london, temporarily, to, support, pitt, s, proposals, for, parliamentary, reforms, he, rejoined, the, party, in, genoa, italy, and, they, continued, their, tour, to, switzerland, milner, accompanied, wilberforce, to, england, and, on, the, journey, they, read, the, rise, and, progress, of, religion, in, the, soul, by, philip, doddridge, a, leading, early, 18th, century, english, nonconformist, wilberforce, s, spiritual, journey, is, thought, to, have, changed, course, at, this, time, he, started, to, rise, early, to, read, the, bible, and, pray, and, kept, a, private, journal, he, underwent, an, evangelical, conversion, regretting, his, past, life, and, resolving, to, commit, his, future, life, and, work, to, the, service, of, god, his, conversion, changed, some, of, his, habits, but, not, his, nature, he, remained, outwardly, cheerful, interested, and, respectful, tactfully, urging, others, towards, his, new, faith, inwardly, he, became, self, critical, harshly, judging, his, spirituality, use, of, time, vanity, self, control, and, relationships, with, others, at, the, time, religious, enthusiasm, was, generally, regarded, as, a, social, transgression, and, was, stigmatised, in, polite, society, evangelicals, in, the, upper, classes, were, exposed, to, contempt, and, ridicule, and, wilberforce, s, conversion, led, him, to, question, whether, he, should, remain, in, public, life, he, sought, guidance, from, john, newton, a, leading, evangelical, anglican, clergyman, of, the, day, and, rector, of, st, mary, woolnoth, both, counselled, him, to, remain, in, politics, and, he, resolved, to, do, so, with, increased, diligence, and, conscientiousness, his, political, views, were, informed, by, his, faith, and, by, his, desire, to, promote, christianity, and, christian, ethics, in, private, and, public, life, his, views, were, often, deeply, conservative, opposed, to, radical, changes, in, a, god, given, political, and, social, order, and, focused, on, issues, such, as, the, observance, of, the, sabbath, and, the, eradication, of, immorality, through, education, and, reform, he, was, often, distrusted, by, progressive, voices, because, of, his, conservatism, and, regarded, with, suspicion, by, many, tories, who, saw, evangelicals, as, radicals, who, wanted, to, the, overthrow, of, church, and, state, in, 1786, wilberforce, leased, a, house, in, old, palace, yard, westminster, in, order, to, be, near, parliament, he, began, using, his, parliamentary, position, to, advocate, reform, by, introducing, a, registration, bill, proposing, limited, changes, to, parliamentary, election, procedures, in, response, to, the, need, for, bodies, for, dissection, by, surgeons, he, brought, forward, a, bill, to, extend, the, measure, permitting, the, dissection, after, execution, of, criminals, such, as, rapists, arsonists, burglars, and, violent, robbers, the, bill, also, advocated, the, reduction, of, sentences, for, women, convicted, of, treason, a, crime, that, at, the, time, included, a, husband, s, murder, the, house, of, commons, passed, both, bills, but, they, were, defeated, in, the, house, of, lords, the, british, initially, became, involved, in, the, slave, trade, during, the, 16th, century, by, 1783, the, triangular, route, that, took, british, made, goods, to, africa, to, buy, slaves, transported, the, enslaved, to, the, west, indies, and, then, brought, slave, grown, products, such, as, sugar, tobacco, and, cotton, to, britain, represented, about, 80, percent, of, great, britain, s, foreign, income, british, ships, dominated, the, slave, trade, supplying, french, spanish, dutch, portuguese, and, british, colonies, and, in, peak, years, carried, forty, thousand, enslaved, men, women, and, children, across, the, atlantic, in, the, horrific, conditions, of, the, middle, passage, of, the, estimated, 11, million, africans, transported, into, slavery, about, 1, 4, million, died, during, the, voyage, the, british, campaign, to, abolish, the, slave, trade, is, generally, considered, to, have, begun, in, the, 1780s, with, the, establishment, of, the, quakers, anti, slavery, committees, and, their, presentation, to, parliament, of, the, first, slave, trade, petition, in, 1783, the, same, year, wilberforce, while, dining, with, his, cambridge, friend, gerard, edwards, met, rev, james, ramsay, a, ship, s, surgeon, who, had, become, a, clergyman, and, medical, supervisor, on, the, island, of, st, christopher, later, st, kitts, ramsay, was, horrified, by, the, conditions, endured, by, the, enslaved, peoples, both, at, sea, and, on, the, plantations, and, returned, to, england, and, joined, abolitionist, movements, wilberforce, did, not, follow, up, on, his, meeting, with, ramsay, but, three, years, later, inspired, by, his, new, faith, wilberforce, became, interested, in, humanitarian, reform, in, november, 1786, he, received, a, letter, from, sir, charles, middleton, that, re, opened, his, interest, in, the, slave, trade, middleton, suggested, that, wilberforce, bring, forward, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, in, parliament, wilberforce, responded, that, he, felt, the, great, importance, of, the, subject, and, thought, himself, unequal, to, the, task, allotted, to, him, but, yet, would, not, positively, decline, it, he, began, to, read, widely, on, the, subject, and, met, with, a, group, of, abolitionists, called, the, testonites, at, middleton, s, home, in, the, early, winter, of, 1786, 1787, in, early, 1787, thomas, clarkson, met, with, wilberforce, for, the, first, time, at, old, palace, yard, and, brought, a, copy, of, his, essay, on, the, subject, clarkson, visited, wilberforce, weekly, bringing, first, hand, evidence, he, had, obtained, about, the, slave, trade, the, quakers, already, working, for, abolition, recognised, the, need, for, influence, within, parliament, and, urged, clarkson, to, secure, a, commitment, from, wilberforce, to, bring, forward, the, case, for, abolition, in, the, house, of, commons, it, was, arranged, that, bennet, langton, a, lincolnshire, landowner, and, mutual, acquaintance, of, wilberforce, and, clarkson, would, organise, a, dinner, party, on, 13, march, 1787, to, ask, wilberforce, formally, to, lead, the, parliamentary, campaign, by, the, end, of, the, evening, wilberforce, had, agreed, in, general, terms, that, he, would, bring, forward, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, in, parliament, provided, that, no, person, more, proper, could, be, found, the, same, spring, on, 12, may, 1787, the, still, hesitant, wilberforce, held, a, conversation, with, william, pitt, and, the, future, prime, minister, william, grenville, as, they, sat, under, a, large, oak, tree, on, pitt, s, estate, in, kent, under, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, wilberforce, oak, at, holwood, house, pitt, challenged, his, friend, to, give, notice, of, a, motion, concerning, the, slave, trade, before, another, parliamentarian, did, wilberforce, s, response, is, not, recorded, but, he, later, declared, this, was, when, he, decided, to, bring, forward, the, motion, wilberforce, had, planned, to, introduce, a, motion, giving, notice, that, he, would, bring, forward, a, bill, for, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, during, the, 1789, parliamentary, session, however, in, january, 1788, he, was, taken, ill, with, a, probable, stress, related, condition, now, thought, to, be, ulcerative, colitis, it, was, several, months, before, he, was, able, to, resume, work, and, he, spent, time, convalescing, at, bath, and, cambridge, his, regular, bouts, of, gastrointestinal, illnesses, precipitated, the, use, of, moderate, quantities, of, opium, which, proved, effective, in, alleviating, his, condition, and, which, he, continued, to, use, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, wilberforce, s, absence, pitt, who, had, long, been, supportive, of, abolition, introduced, the, preparatory, motion, himself, and, ordered, a, privy, council, investigation, into, the, slave, trade, followed, by, a, house, of, commons, review, with, the, publication, of, the, privy, council, report, in, april, 1789, and, following, months, of, planning, wilberforce, commenced, his, parliamentary, campaign, on, 12, may, 1789, he, made, his, first, major, speech, on, the, subject, of, abolition, in, the, house, of, commons, in, which, he, reasoned, that, the, trade, was, morally, reprehensible, and, an, issue, of, natural, justice, drawing, on, thomas, clarkson, s, mass, of, evidence, he, described, in, detail, the, appalling, conditions, in, which, enslaved, people, travelled, from, africa, in, the, middle, passage, and, argued, that, abolishing, the, trade, would, also, bring, an, improvement, to, the, conditions, of, existing, slaves, in, the, west, indies, he, moved, twelve, resolutions, condemning, the, slave, trade, but, did, not, refer, to, the, abolition, of, slavery, itself, instead, dwelling, on, the, potential, for, reproduction, in, the, existing, slave, population, should, the, trade, be, abolished, with, several, parliamentarians, signalling, support, for, the, bill, the, opponents, of, abolition, delayed, the, vote, by, proposing, that, the, house, of, commons, hear, its, own, evidence, wilberforce, in, a, decision, that, has, been, criticised, for, prolonging, the, slave, trade, reluctantly, agreed, the, hearings, were, not, completed, by, the, end, of, the, parliamentary, session, and, were, deferred, until, the, following, year, in, the, meantime, wilberforce, and, clarkson, tried, unsuccessfully, to, take, advantage, of, the, egalitarian, atmosphere, of, the, french, revolution, to, press, for, france, s, abolition, of, the, trade, in, january, 1790, wilberforce, succeeded, in, speeding, up, the, hearings, by, gaining, approval, for, a, smaller, parliamentary, select, committee, to, consider, the, vast, quantity, of, evidence, which, had, been, accumulated, wilberforce, s, house, in, old, palace, yard, became, a, centre, for, the, abolitionists, campaign, and, the, location, for, many, strategy, meetings, petitioners, for, other, causes, also, besieged, him, there, let, us, not, despair, it, is, a, blessed, cause, and, success, ere, long, will, crown, our, exertions, already, we, have, gained, one, victory, we, have, obtained, for, these, poor, creatures, the, recognition, of, their, human, nature, which, for, a, while, was, most, shamefully, denied, this, is, the, first, fruits, of, our, efforts, let, us, persevere, and, our, triumph, will, be, complete, never, never, will, we, desist, till, we, have, wiped, away, this, scandal, from, the, christian, name, released, ourselves, from, the, load, of, guilt, under, which, we, at, present, labour, and, extinguished, every, trace, of, this, bloody, traffic, of, which, our, posterity, looking, back, to, the, history, of, these, enlightened, times, will, scarce, believe, that, it, has, been, suffered, to, exist, so, long, a, disgrace, and, dishonour, to, this, country, william, wilberforce, speech, before, the, house, of, commons, 18, april, 1791, interrupted, by, a, general, election, in, june, 1790, the, committee, finished, hearing, witnesses, and, in, april, 1791, with, a, closely, reasoned, four, hour, speech, wilberforce, introduced, the, first, parliamentary, bill, to, abolish, the, slave, trade, after, two, evenings, of, debate, the, bill, was, easily, defeated, by, 163, votes, to, 88, as, the, political, climate, having, swung, in, a, conservative, direction, after, the, french, revolution, and, in, reaction, to, an, increase, in, radicalism, and, to, slave, revolts, in, the, french, west, indies, a, protracted, parliamentary, campaign, to, abolish, slavery, continued, and, wilberforce, remained, committed, to, this, cause, despite, frustration, and, hostility, he, was, supported, by, fellow, members, of, the, clapham, sect, among, whom, was, his, best, friend, and, cousin, henry, thornton, wilberforce, accepted, an, invitation, to, share, a, house, with, henry, thornton, in, 1792, moving, into, his, own, home, after, thornton, s, marriage, in, 1796, wilberforce, the, clapham, sect, and, others, were, anxious, to, demonstrate, that, africans, and, particularly, freed, slaves, had, human, and, economic, abilities, beyond, the, slave, trade, and, capable, of, sustaining, a, well, ordered, society, trade, and, cultivation, inspired, in, part, by, the, utopian, vision, of, granville, sharp, they, became, involved, in, the, establishment, in, 1792, of, a, free, colony, in, sierra, leone, with, black, settlers, from, britain, nova, scotia, and, jamaica, as, well, as, native, africans, and, some, whites, they, formed, the, sierra, leone, company, with, wilberforce, subscribing, liberally, to, the, project, in, money, and, time, on, 2, april, 1792, wilberforce, brought, another, bill, calling, for, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, henry, dundas, as, home, secretary, proposed, a, compromise, solution, of, gradual, abolition, of, the, trade, over, several, years, this, was, passed, by, 230, to, 85, votes, but, wilberforce, believed, that, it, was, little, more, than, a, clever, ploy, to, ensure, that, total, abolition, would, be, delayed, indefinitely, on, 26, february, 1793, another, vote, to, abolish, the, slave, trade, was, narrowly, defeated, by, eight, votes, the, outbreak, of, war, with, france, the, same, month, prevented, further, consideration, of, the, issue, as, politicians, concentrated, on, the, national, crisis, and, the, threat, of, invasion, the, same, year, and, again, in, 1794, wilberforce, unsuccessfully, brought, before, parliament, a, bill, to, outlaw, british, ships, from, supplying, enslaved, people, to, foreign, colonies, he, voiced, his, concern, about, the, war, and, urged, pitt, and, his, government, to, make, greater, efforts, to, end, hostilities, growing, more, alarmed, on, 31, december, 1794, wilberforce, moved, that, the, government, seek, a, peaceful, resolution, with, france, a, stance, that, created, a, temporary, breach, in, his, long, friendship, with, pitt, abolition, continued, to, be, associated, in, the, public, consciousness, with, the, french, revolution, and, with, british, radical, groups, resulting, in, a, decline, in, public, support, despite, this, wilberforce, continued, to, introduce, abolition, bills, throughout, the, 1790s, the, early, years, of, the, 19th, century, saw, an, increased, public, interest, in, abolition, in, june, 1804, wilberforce, s, bill, to, abolish, the, slave, trade, successfully, passed, all, its, stages, through, the, house, of, commons, however, it, was, too, late, in, the, parliamentary, session, for, it, to, complete, its, passage, through, the, house, of, lords, on, its, reintroduction, during, the, 1805, session, it, was, defeated, with, even, the, usually, sympathetic, pitt, failing, to, support, it, on, this, occasion, and, throughout, the, campaign, abolition, was, held, back, by, wilberforce, s, trusting, even, credulous, nature, and, his, deferential, attitude, towards, those, in, power, he, found, it, difficult, to, believe, that, men, of, rank, would, not, do, what, he, perceived, to, be, the, right, thing, and, was, reluctant, to, confront, them, when, they, did, not, following, pitt, s, death, in, january, 1806, wilberforce, increased, his, collaboration, with, the, whigs, especially, the, abolitionists, he, gave, general, support, to, the, grenville, fox, administration, which, brought, more, abolitionists, into, the, cabinet, wilberforce, and, charles, fox, led, the, campaign, in, the, house, of, commons, a, radical, change, of, tactics, which, involved, the, introduction, of, a, bill, to, ban, british, subjects, from, aiding, or, participating, in, the, slave, trade, to, the, french, colonies, was, suggested, by, the, maritime, lawyer, james, stephen, a, bill, was, introduced, and, approved, by, the, cabinet, and, wilberforce, and, other, abolitionists, maintained, a, self, imposed, silence, so, as, not, to, draw, any, attention, to, the, effect, of, the, bill, the, approach, was, successful, and, the, foreign, slave, trade, bill, received, royal, assent, on, 23, may, 1806, wilberforce, and, clarkson, collected, a, large, volume, of, evidence, against, the, slave, trade, over, the, previous, two, decades, and, wilberforce, spent, the, latter, part, of, 1806, writing, a, letter, on, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, which, was, a, comprehensive, restatement, of, the, abolitionists, case, wilberforce, was, re, elected, as, an, mp, for, yorkshire, in, the, 1806, united, kingdom, general, election, after, which, he, returned, to, finishing, and, publishing, his, letter, a, 400, page, book, which, formed, the, basis, for, the, final, phase, of, the, campaign, lord, grenville, the, prime, minister, successfully, introduced, an, abolition, bill, in, the, house, of, lords, first, then, charles, grey, moved, for, a, second, reading, in, the, commons, on, 23, february, 1807, as, tributes, were, made, to, wilberforce, whose, face, streamed, with, tears, the, bill, was, carried, by, 283, votes, to, 16, excited, supporters, suggested, taking, advantage, of, the, large, majority, to, seek, the, abolition, of, slavery, itself, but, wilberforce, made, it, clear, that, total, emancipation, was, not, the, immediate, goal, in, his, youth, william, wilberforce, showed, little, interest, in, women, but, when, he, was, in, his, late, thirties, his, friend, thomas, babington, recommended, 25, year, old, barbara, ann, spooner, 1771, 1847, as, a, potential, bride, wilberforce, met, her, two, days, later, on, 15, april, 1797, and, was, immediately, smitten, following, an, eight, day, whirlwind, romance, he, proposed, despite, the, urgings, of, friends, to, slow, down, the, couple, married, at, the, church, of, st, swithin, in, bath, somerset, on, 30, may, 1797, they, were, devoted, to, each, other, and, barbara, was, very, attentive, and, supportive, to, wilberforce, in, his, increasing, ill, health, though, she, showed, little, interest, in, his, political, activities, they, had, six, children, in, fewer, than, ten, years, william, born, 1798, barbara, born, 1799, elizabeth, born, 1801, robert, born, 1802, samuel, born, 1805, and, henry, born, 1807, wilberforce, was, an, indulgent, and, adoring, father, who, revelled, in, his, time, at, home, and, at, play, with, his, children, wilberforce, was, highly, conservative, on, many, political, and, social, issues, he, advocated, change, in, society, through, christianity, and, improvement, in, morals, education, and, religion, fearing, and, opposing, radical, causes, and, revolution, the, radical, writer, william, cobbett, was, among, those, who, attacked, what, they, saw, as, wilberforce, s, hypocrisy, in, campaigning, for, better, working, conditions, for, enslaved, people, while, british, workers, lived, in, terrible, conditions, at, home, critics, noted, wilberforce, s, support, of, the, suspension, of, habeas, corpus, in, 1795, and, his, votes, for, pitt, s, gagging, bills, which, banned, meetings, of, more, than, 50, people, allowing, speakers, to, be, arrested, and, imposing, harsh, penalties, on, those, who, attacked, the, constitution, wilberforce, was, opposed, to, giving, workers, rights, to, organise, into, unions, in, 1799, speaking, in, favour, of, the, combination, act, which, suppressed, trade, union, activity, throughout, britain, and, calling, unions, a, general, disease, in, our, society, he, also, opposed, an, enquiry, into, the, 1819, peterloo, massacre, in, which, eleven, protesters, were, killed, at, a, political, rally, demanding, reform, concerned, about, bad, men, who, wished, to, produce, anarchy, and, confusion, he, approved, of, the, government, s, six, acts, which, further, limited, public, meetings, and, seditious, writings, wilberforce, s, actions, led, the, essayist, william, hazlitt, to, condemn, him, as, one, who, preaches, vital, christianity, to, untutored, savages, and, tolerates, its, worst, abuses, in, civilised, states, wilberforce, s, views, of, women, and, religion, were, also, conservative, he, disapproved, of, women, anti, slavery, activists, such, as, elizabeth, heyrick, who, organised, women, s, abolitionist, groups, in, the, 1820s, protesting, or, ladies, to, meet, to, publish, to, go, from, house, to, house, stirring, up, petitions, these, appear, to, me, proceedings, unsuited, to, the, female, character, as, delineated, in, scripture, wilberforce, initially, strongly, opposed, bills, for, catholic, emancipation, which, would, have, allowed, catholics, to, become, mps, hold, public, office, and, serve, in, the, army, although, by, 1813, he, had, changed, his, views, and, spoke, in, favour, of, a, similar, bill, wilberforce, advocated, legislation, to, improve, the, working, conditions, for, chimney, sweeps, and, textile, workers, engaged, in, prison, reform, and, supported, campaigns, to, restrict, capital, punishment, and, the, severe, punishments, meted, out, under, the, game, laws, he, recognised, the, importance, of, education, in, alleviating, poverty, and, when, hannah, more, and, her, sister, established, sunday, schools, for, the, poor, in, somerset, and, the, mendips, he, provided, financial, and, moral, support, as, they, faced, opposition, from, landowners, and, anglican, clergy, from, the, late, 1780s, onward, wilberforce, campaigned, for, limited, parliamentary, reform, such, as, the, abolition, of, rotten, boroughs, and, the, redistribution, of, commons, seats, to, growing, towns, and, cities, though, by, 1832, he, feared, that, such, measures, went, too, far, with, others, wilberforce, founded, the, world, s, first, animal, welfare, organisation, the, society, for, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, later, the, royal, society, for, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, he, was, also, opposed, to, duelling, which, he, described, as, the, disgrace, of, a, christian, society, and, was, appalled, when, his, friend, pitt, engaged, in, a, duel, with, george, tierney, in, 1798, particularly, as, it, occurred, on, a, sunday, the, christian, day, of, rest, wilberforce, was, generous, with, his, time, and, money, believing, that, those, with, wealth, had, a, duty, to, give, a, significant, portion, of, their, income, to, the, needy, yearly, he, gave, away, thousands, of, pounds, much, of, it, to, clergymen, to, distribute, in, their, parishes, he, paid, off, the, debts, of, others, supported, education, and, missions, and, in, a, year, of, food, shortages, gave, to, charity, more, than, his, own, yearly, income, he, was, exceptionally, hospitable, and, could, not, bear, to, sack, any, of, his, servants, as, a, result, his, home, was, full, of, old, and, incompetent, servants, kept, on, in, charity, although, he, was, often, months, behind, in, his, correspondence, wilberforce, responded, to, numerous, requests, for, advice, or, for, help, in, obtaining, professorships, military, promotions, and, livings, for, clergymen, or, for, the, reprieve, of, death, sentences, a, supporter, of, the, evangelical, wing, of, the, church, of, england, wilberforce, believed, that, the, revitalisation, of, the, church, and, individual, christian, observance, would, lead, to, a, harmonious, moral, society, he, sought, to, elevate, the, status, of, religion, in, public, and, private, life, making, piety, fashionable, in, both, the, upper, and, middle, classes, of, society, to, this, end, in, april, 1797, wilberforce, published, a, practical, view, of, the, prevailing, religious, system, of, professed, christians, in, the, higher, and, middle, classes, of, this, country, contrasted, with, real, christianity, on, which, he, had, been, working, since, 1793, this, was, an, exposition, of, new, testament, doctrine, and, teachings, and, a, call, for, a, revival, of, christianity, as, a, response, to, the, moral, decline, of, the, nation, illustrating, his, own, testimony, and, the, views, which, inspired, him, the, book, was, influential, and, a, best, seller, 7, 500, copies, were, sold, within, six, months, and, it, was, translated, into, several, languages, wilberforce, fostered, and, supported, missionary, activity, in, britain, and, abroad, and, was, involved, with, other, members, of, the, clapham, sect, in, various, evangelical, and, charitable, organisations, he, was, a, founding, member, of, the, church, missionary, society, since, renamed, the, church, mission, society, and, an, early, vice, president, of, the, london, society, for, promoting, christianity, among, the, jews, later, the, church, s, ministry, among, jewish, people, horrified, by, the, lack, of, christian, evangelism, in, india, wilberforce, used, the, 1793, renewal, of, the, british, east, india, company, s, charter, to, propose, the, addition, of, clauses, requiring, the, company, to, provide, teachers, and, chaplains, and, to, commit, to, the, religious, improvement, of, indians, the, plan, was, unsuccessful, due, to, lobbying, by, the, directors, of, the, company, who, feared, that, their, commercial, interests, would, be, damaged, wilberforce, tried, again, in, 1813, when, the, charter, next, came, up, for, renewal, using, petitions, meetings, lobbying, and, letter, writing, he, successfully, campaigned, for, changes, to, the, charter, speaking, in, favour, of, the, charter, act, 1813, he, criticised, the, east, india, company, and, their, rule, in, india, for, its, hypocrisy, and, racial, prejudice, while, also, condemning, aspects, of, hinduism, including, the, caste, system, infanticide, polygamy, and, sati, greatly, concerned, by, what, he, perceived, to, be, the, degeneracy, of, british, society, wilberforce, was, active, in, matters, of, moral, reform, lobbying, against, the, torrent, of, profaneness, that, every, day, makes, more, rapid, advances, and, considered, this, issue, and, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, as, equally, important, goals, at, the, suggestion, of, wilberforce, and, bishop, porteus, king, george, iii, was, requested, by, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, to, issue, in, 1787, a, proclamation, for, the, encouragement, of, piety, and, virtue, as, a, remedy, for, the, rising, tide, of, immorality, the, proclamation, commanded, the, prosecution, of, those, guilty, of, excessive, drinking, blasphemy, profane, swearing, and, cursing, lewdness, profanation, of, the, lord, s, day, and, other, dissolute, immoral, or, disorderly, practices, greeted, largely, with, public, indifference, wilberforce, sought, to, increase, its, impact, by, mobilising, public, figures, to, the, cause, and, by, founding, the, society, for, the, suppression, of, vice, this, and, other, societies, in, which, wilberforce, was, a, prime, mover, mustered, support, for, the, prosecution, of, those, who, had, been, charged, with, violating, relevant, laws, including, brothel, keepers, distributors, of, pornographic, material, and, those, who, did, not, respect, the, sabbath, the, writer, and, clergyman, sydney, smith, criticised, wilberforce, for, being, more, interested, in, the, sins, of, the, poor, than, those, of, the, rich, and, suggested, that, a, better, name, would, be, the, society, for, suppressing, the, vices, of, persons, whose, income, does, not, exceed, 500, per, annum, wilberforce, s, attempts, to, legislate, against, adultery, and, sunday, newspapers, were, also, in, vain, his, involvement, and, leadership, in, other, less, punitive, approaches, were, more, successful, in, the, long, term, however, by, the, end, of, his, life, british, morals, manners, and, sense, of, social, responsibility, had, increased, paving, the, way, for, future, changes, in, societal, conventions, and, attitudes, during, the, victorian, era, wilberforce, worked, with, the, members, of, the, african, institution, to, ensure, the, enforcement, of, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, and, to, promote, abolitionist, negotiations, with, other, countries, in, particular, the, united, states, had, abolished, the, slave, trade, after, 1808, and, wilberforce, lobbied, the, american, government, to, enforce, its, own, mandated, prohibition, more, strongly, the, same, year, wilberforce, moved, his, family, from, clapham, to, a, sizeable, mansion, with, a, large, garden, in, kensington, gore, closer, to, the, houses, of, parliament, in, worsening, health, by, 1812, wilberforce, resigned, his, yorkshire, seat, and, became, mp, for, the, rotten, borough, of, bramber, in, sussex, a, seat, with, little, or, no, constituency, obligations, thus, allowing, him, more, time, for, his, family, and, the, causes, that, interested, him, from, 1816, wilberforce, introduced, a, series, of, bills, which, would, require, the, compulsory, registration, of, enslaved, people, together, with, details, of, their, country, of, origin, permitting, the, illegal, importation, of, foreign, slaves, to, be, detected, later, in, the, same, year, he, began, to, publicly, denounce, slavery, itself, though, he, did, not, demand, immediate, emancipation, believing, incremental, change, to, be, more, effective, in, achieving, abolition, in, 1820, after, a, period, of, poor, health, and, with, his, eyesight, failing, wilberforce, further, limited, public, activities, although, he, became, embroiled, in, unsuccessful, mediation, attempts, between, king, george, iv, and, his, estranged, wife, caroline, of, brunswick, who, had, sought, her, rights, as, queen, of, the, realm, wilberforce, still, hoped, to, lay, a, foundation, for, some, future, measures, for, the, emancipation, of, the, poor, slaves, aware, that, the, cause, would, need, younger, men, to, continue, the, work, in, 1821, he, asked, mp, thomas, fowell, buxton, to, take, over, leadership, of, the, campaign, in, the, commons, as, the, 1820s, continued, wilberforce, increasingly, became, more, of, a, figurehead, for, the, abolitionist, movement, although, he, continued, to, appear, at, anti, slavery, meetings, welcoming, visitors, and, maintaining, a, busy, correspondence, on, the, subject, in, 1823, wilberforce, s, 56, page, appeal, to, the, religion, justice, and, humanity, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, british, empire, in, behalf, of, the, negro, slaves, in, the, west, indies, was, published, the, treatise, stated, that, total, emancipation, was, morally, and, ethically, required, and, that, slavery, was, a, national, crime, which, must, be, ended, by, parliamentary, legislation, to, gradually, abolish, slavery, members, of, parliament, did, not, agree, and, government, opposition, in, march, 1823, stymied, wilberforce, s, call, for, abolition, on, 15, may, 1823, buxton, moved, another, resolution, in, parliament, for, gradual, emancipation, subsequent, debates, followed, on, 16, march, and, 11, june, 1824, in, which, wilberforce, made, his, last, speeches, in, the, house, of, commons, and, which, again, saw, the, emancipationists, outmanoeuvred, by, the, government, wilberforce, s, health, was, continuing, to, fail, and, he, suffered, further, illnesses, in, 1824, and, 1825, with, his, family, concerned, that, his, life, was, endangered, he, declined, a, peerage, and, resigned, his, seat, in, parliament, leaving, the, campaign, to, others, in, 1826, wilberforce, moved, from, his, large, house, in, kensington, gore, to, hendon, park, a, more, modest, property, in, the, countryside, of, mill, hill, north, of, london, where, he, was, joined, by, his, son, william, and, family, william, had, attempted, a, series, of, educational, and, career, paths, and, a, venture, into, farming, in, 1830, led, to, huge, losses, which, his, father, repaid, in, full, despite, offers, from, others, to, assist, this, left, wilberforce, with, little, income, and, he, was, obliged, to, let, his, home, and, spend, the, rest, of, his, life, visiting, family, members, and, friends, he, continued, his, support, for, the, anti, slavery, cause, including, attending, and, chairing, meetings, of, the, anti, slavery, society, wilberforce, approved, of, the, 1830, election, victory, of, the, more, progressive, whigs, though, he, was, concerned, about, the, implications, of, their, reform, bill, which, proposed, the, redistribution, of, parliamentary, seats, towards, newer, towns, and, cities, and, an, extension, of, the, franchise, in, 1833, wilberforce, s, health, declined, further, and, he, suffered, a, severe, attack, of, influenza, from, which, he, never, fully, recovered, he, made, a, final, anti, slavery, speech, in, april, 1833, at, a, public, meeting, in, maidstone, kent, the, following, month, the, whig, government, introduced, the, bill, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, formally, saluting, wilberforce, in, the, process, on, 26, july, 1833, wilberforce, heard, of, government, concessions, that, guaranteed, the, passing, of, the, bill, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, the, following, day, he, grew, much, weaker, and, he, died, early, on, the, morning, of, 29, july, at, his, cousin, s, house, in, cadogan, place, london, wilberforce, had, left, instructions, that, he, be, buried, with, his, sister, and, daughter, at, st, mary, s, church, stoke, newington, just, north, of, london, however, the, leading, members, of, both, houses, of, parliament, urged, that, he, be, honoured, with, a, burial, in, westminster, abbey, the, family, agreed, and, on, 3, august, 1833, wilberforce, was, buried, in, the, north, transept, close, to, his, friend, william, pitt, the, funeral, was, attended, by, many, members, of, parliament, as, well, as, by, members, of, the, public, the, pallbearers, included, the, duke, of, gloucester, the, lord, chancellor, henry, brougham, and, the, speaker, of, the, house, of, commons, charles, manners, sutton, while, tributes, were, paid, and, wilberforce, was, laid, to, rest, both, houses, of, parliament, suspended, their, business, as, a, mark, of, respect, five, years, after, his, death, sons, robert, and, samuel, wilberforce, published, a, five, volume, biography, about, their, father, and, subsequently, a, collection, of, his, letters, in, 1840, the, biography, was, controversial, in, that, the, authors, emphasised, wilberforce, s, role, in, the, abolition, movement, and, played, down, the, important, work, of, thomas, clarkson, clarkson, wrote, a, book, refuting, their, version, of, events, and, the, sons, eventually, made, a, half, hearted, private, apology, to, him, and, removed, the, offending, passages, in, a, revision, of, their, biography, for, more, than, a, century, wilberforce, s, role, in, the, campaign, dominated, the, historical, record, later, historians, have, noted, the, warm, and, highly, productive, relationship, between, clarkson, and, wilberforce, and, have, termed, it, one, of, history, s, great, partnerships, without, both, the, parliamentary, leadership, supplied, by, wilberforce, and, the, research, and, public, mobilisation, organised, by, clarkson, abolition, could, not, have, been, achieved, as, his, sons, had, desired, and, planned, wilberforce, has, long, been, viewed, as, a, christian, hero, a, statesman, saint, held, up, as, a, role, model, for, putting, his, faith, into, action, contemporary, evangelical, and, conservative, movements, in, north, america, appropriate, his, name, and, example, in, their, activism, the, strategies, of, wilberforce, and, other, abolitionists, are, invoked, by, anti, abortion, activists, who, controversially, equate, the, abolition, of, slavery, with, ending, abortion, wilberforce, has, also, been, described, as, a, humanitarian, reformer, who, contributed, to, reshaping, the, political, and, social, attitudes, of, the, time, by, promoting, concepts, of, social, responsibility, and, action, in, the, 1940s, the, role, of, wilberforce, and, the, clapham, sect, in, abolition, was, downplayed, by, historian, eric, williams, who, argued, that, abolition, was, motivated, not, by, humanitarianism, but, by, economics, as, the, west, indian, sugar, industry, was, in, decline, williams, s, approach, strongly, influenced, historians, for, much, of, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, more, recent, historians, have, noted, that, the, sugar, industry, was, still, making, large, profits, at, the, time, of, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, and, this, has, led, to, a, renewed, interest, in, wilberforce, and, the, evangelicals, as, well, as, a, recognition, of, the, anti, slavery, movement, as, a, prototype, for, subsequent, humanitarian, campaigns, wilberforce, s, life, and, work, have, been, commemorated, in, the, united, kingdom, and, elsewhere, in, westminster, abbey, a, seated, statue, of, wilberforce, by, samuel, joseph, was, erected, in, 1840, bearing, an, epitaph, praising, his, christian, character, and, his, long, labour, to, abolish, the, slave, trade, and, slavery, in, wilberforce, s, hometown, of, hull, a, public, subscription, in, 1834, funded, the, wilberforce, monument, a, 31, metre, 102, ft, greek, doric, column, topped, by, a, statue, of, wilberforce, which, stands, in, the, grounds, of, hull, college, near, queen, s, gardens, wilberforce, memorial, school, for, the, blind, in, york, was, established, in, 1833, in, his, honour, wilberforce, s, birthplace, was, acquired, by, the, city, corporation, in, 1903, and, following, renovation, wilberforce, house, in, hull, was, opened, as, britain, s, first, slavery, museum, in, 2006, the, university, of, hull, established, the, wilberforce, institute, for, the, study, of, slavery, and, emancipation, in, a, building, beside, wilberforce, house, various, churches, within, the,
