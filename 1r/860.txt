raymond, bernard, cattell, 20, march, 1905, 2, february, 1998, was, a, british, american, psychologist, known, for, his, psychometric, research, into, intrapersonal, psychological, structure, his, work, also, explored, the, basic, dimensions, of, personality, and, temperament, the, range, of, cognitive, abilities, the, dynamic, dimensions, of, motivation, and, emotion, the, clinical, dimensions, of, abnormal, personality, patterns, of, group, syntality, and, social, behavior, applications, of, personality, research, to, psychotherapy, and, learning, theory, predictors, of, creativity, and, achievement, and, many, multivariate, research, methods, including, the, refinement, of, factor, analytic, methods, for, exploring, and, measuring, these, domains, cattell, authored, co, authored, or, edited, almost, 60, scholarly, books, more, than, 500, research, articles, and, over, 30, standardized, psychometric, tests, questionnaires, and, rating, scales, according, to, a, widely, cited, ranking, cattell, was, the, 16th, most, eminent, 7th, most, cited, in, the, scientific, journal, literature, and, among, the, most, productive, psychologists, of, the, 20th, century, he, was, a, controversial, figure, due, in, part, to, his, friendships, with, and, intellectual, respect, for, white, supremacists, and, neo, nazis, cattell, was, an, early, proponent, of, using, factor, analytic, methods, instead, of, what, he, called, subjective, verbal, theorizing, to, explore, empirically, the, basic, dimensions, of, personality, motivation, and, cognitive, abilities, one, of, the, results, of, cattell, s, application, of, factor, analysis, was, his, discovery, of, 16, separate, primary, trait, factors, within, the, normal, personality, sphere, based, on, the, trait, lexicon, he, called, these, factors, source, traits, this, theory, of, personality, factors, and, the, self, report, instrument, used, to, measure, them, are, known, respectively, as, the, 16, personality, factor, model, and, the, 16pf, questionnaire, 16pf, cattell, also, undertook, a, series, of, empirical, studies, into, the, basic, dimensions, of, other, psychological, domains, intelligence, motivation, career, assessment, and, vocational, interests, cattell, theorized, the, existence, of, fluid, and, crystallized, intelligence, to, explain, human, cognitive, ability, investigated, changes, in, gf, and, gc, over, the, lifespan, and, constructed, the, culture, fair, intelligence, test, to, minimize, the, bias, of, written, language, and, cultural, background, in, intelligence, testing, cattell, s, research, was, mainly, in, personality, abilities, motivations, and, innovative, multivariate, research, methods, and, statistical, analysis, especially, his, many, refinements, to, exploratory, factor, analytic, methodology, in, his, personality, research, he, is, best, remembered, for, his, factor, analytically, derived, 16, factor, model, of, normal, personality, structure, arguing, for, this, model, over, eysenck, s, simpler, higher, order, 3, factor, model, and, constructing, measures, of, these, primary, factors, in, the, form, of, the, 16pf, questionnaire, and, its, downward, extensions, hspq, and, cpq, respectively, he, was, the, first, to, propose, a, hierarchical, multi, level, model, of, personality, with, the, many, basic, primary, factors, at, the, first, level, and, the, fewer, broader, second, order, factors, at, a, higher, stratum, of, personality, organization, these, global, trait, constructs, are, the, precursors, of, the, currently, popular, big, five, ffm, model, of, personality, cattell, s, research, led, to, further, advances, such, as, distinguishing, between, state, and, trait, measures, e, g, state, trait, anxiety, ranging, on, a, continuum, from, immediate, transitory, emotional, states, through, longer, acting, mood, states, dynamic, motivational, traits, and, also, relatively, enduring, personality, traits, cattell, also, conducted, empirical, studies, into, developmental, changes, in, personality, trait, constructs, across, the, lifespan, in, the, cognitive, abilities, domain, cattell, researched, a, wide, range, of, abilities, but, is, best, known, for, the, distinction, between, fluid, and, crystallized, intelligence, he, distinguished, between, the, abstract, adaptive, biologically, influenced, cognitive, abilities, that, he, called, fluid, intelligence, and, the, applied, experience, based, and, learning, enhanced, ability, that, he, called, crystallized, intelligence, thus, for, example, a, mechanic, who, has, worked, on, airplane, engines, for, 30, years, might, have, a, huge, amount, of, crystallized, knowledge, about, the, workings, of, these, engines, while, a, new, young, engineer, with, more, fluid, intelligence, might, focus, more, on, the, theory, of, engine, functioning, these, two, types, of, abilities, might, complement, each, other, and, work, together, toward, achieving, a, goal, as, a, foundation, for, this, distinction, cattell, developed, the, investment, model, of, ability, arguing, that, crystallized, ability, emerged, from, the, investment, of, fluid, ability, in, a, particular, topic, of, knowledge, he, contributed, to, cognitive, epidemiology, with, his, theory, that, crystallized, knowledge, while, more, applied, could, be, maintained, or, even, increase, after, fluid, ability, begins, to, decline, with, age, a, concept, used, in, the, national, adult, reading, test, nart, cattell, constructed, a, number, of, ability, tests, including, the, comprehensive, ability, battery, cab, that, provides, measures, of, 20, primary, abilities, and, the, culture, fair, intelligence, test, cfit, which, was, designed, to, provide, a, completely, non, verbal, measure, of, intelligence, like, that, now, seen, in, the, raven, s, the, culture, fair, intelligence, scales, were, intended, to, minimize, the, influence, of, cultural, or, educational, background, on, the, results, of, intelligence, tests, in, regard, to, statistical, methodology, in, 1960, cattell, founded, the, society, of, multivariate, experimental, psychology, smep, and, its, journal, multivariate, behavioral, research, in, order, to, bring, together, encourage, and, support, scientists, interested, in, multi, variate, research, he, was, an, early, and, frequent, user, of, factor, analysis, a, statistical, procedure, for, finding, underlying, factors, in, data, cattell, also, developed, new, factor, analytic, techniques, for, example, by, inventing, the, scree, test, which, uses, the, curve, of, latent, roots, to, judge, the, optimal, number, of, factors, to, extract, he, also, developed, a, new, factor, analysis, rotation, procedure, the, procrustes, or, non, orthogonal, rotation, designed, to, let, the, data, itself, determine, the, best, location, of, factors, rather, than, requiring, orthogonal, factors, additional, contributions, include, the, coefficient, of, profile, similarity, taking, account, of, shape, scatter, and, level, of, two, score, profiles, p, technique, factor, analysis, based, on, repeated, measurements, of, a, single, individual, sampling, of, variables, rather, than, sampling, of, persons, dr, technique, factor, analysis, for, elucidating, change, dimensions, including, transitory, emotional, states, and, longer, lasting, mood, states, the, taxonome, program, for, ascertaining, the, number, and, contents, of, clusters, in, a, data, set, the, rotoplot, program, for, attaining, maximum, simple, structure, factor, pattern, solutions, as, well, he, put, forward, the, dynamic, calculus, for, assessing, interests, and, motivation, the, basic, data, relations, box, assessing, dimensions, of, experimental, designs, the, group, syntality, construct, personality, of, a, group, the, triadic, theory, of, cognitive, abilities, the, ability, dimension, analysis, chart, adac, and, multiple, abstract, variance, analysis, mava, with, specification, equations, to, embody, genetic, and, environmental, variables, and, their, interactions, as, lee, j, cronbach, at, stanford, university, stated, the, thirty, year, evolution, of, the, data, box, and, related, methodology, fed, on, bold, conjecture, self, criticism, unbridled, imagination, rational, comparison, of, models, in, the, abstract, and, responsiveness, to, the, nasty, surprises, of, data, the, story, epitomizes, scientific, effort, at, its, best, raymond, cattell, was, born, on, 20, march, 1905, in, hill, top, west, bromwich, a, small, town, in, england, near, birmingham, where, his, father, s, family, was, involved, in, inventing, new, parts, for, engines, automobiles, and, other, machines, thus, his, growing, up, years, were, a, time, when, great, technological, and, scientific, ideas, and, advances, were, taking, place, and, this, greatly, influenced, his, perspective, on, how, a, few, people, could, actually, make, a, difference, in, the, world, he, wrote, 1905, was, a, felicitous, year, in, which, to, be, born, the, airplane, was, just, a, year, old, the, curies, and, rutherford, in, that, year, penetrated, the, heart, of, the, atom, and, the, mystery, of, its, radiations, alfred, binet, launched, the, first, intelligence, test, and, einstein, the, theory, of, relativity, when, cattell, was, about, five, years, old, his, family, moved, to, torquay, devon, in, the, south, west, of, england, where, he, grew, up, with, strong, interests, in, science, and, spent, a, lot, of, time, sailing, around, the, coastline, he, was, the, first, of, his, family, and, the, only, one, in, his, generation, to, attend, university, in, 1921, he, was, awarded, a, scholarship, to, study, chemistry, at, king, s, college, london, where, he, obtained, a, bsc, hons, degree, with, 1st, class, honors, at, age, 19, years, while, studying, physics, and, chemistry, at, university, he, learned, from, influential, people, in, many, other, fields, who, visited, or, lived, in, london, he, writes, browsed, far, outside, science, in, my, reading, and, attended, public, lectures, bertrand, russell, h, g, wells, huxley, and, shaw, being, my, favorite, speakers, the, last, in, a, meeting, at, king, s, college, converted, me, to, vegetarianism, for, almost, two, years, as, he, observed, first, hand, the, terrible, destruction, and, suffering, after, world, war, i, cattell, was, increasingly, attracted, to, the, idea, of, applying, the, tools, of, science, to, the, serious, human, problems, that, he, saw, around, him, he, stated, that, in, the, cultural, upheaval, after, wwi, he, felt, that, his, laboratory, table, had, begun, to, seem, too, small, and, the, world, s, problems, so, vast, thus, he, decided, to, change, his, field, of, study, and, pursue, a, phd, in, psychology, at, king, s, college, london, which, he, received, in, 1929, the, title, of, his, phd, dissertation, was, the, subjective, character, of, cognition, and, pre, sensational, development, of, perception, his, phd, advisor, at, king, s, college, london, was, francis, aveling, d, d, d, sc, phd, d, litt, who, was, also, president, of, the, british, psychological, society, from, 1926, until, 1929, in, 1939, cattell, was, honored, for, his, outstanding, contributions, to, psychological, research, with, conferral, of, the, prestigious, higher, doctorate, d, sc, from, the, university, of, london, while, working, on, his, phd, cattell, had, accepted, a, position, teaching, and, counseling, in, the, department, of, education, at, exeter, university, he, ultimately, found, this, disappointing, because, there, was, limited, opportunity, to, conduct, research, cattell, did, his, graduate, work, with, charles, spearman, the, english, psychologist, and, statistician, who, is, famous, for, his, pioneering, work, on, assessing, intelligence, including, the, development, of, the, idea, of, a, general, factor, of, intelligence, termed, g, during, his, three, years, at, exeter, cattell, courted, and, married, monica, rogers, whom, he, had, known, since, his, boyhood, in, devon, and, they, had, a, son, together, she, left, him, about, four, years, later, soon, afterward, he, moved, to, leicester, where, he, organized, one, of, england, s, first, child, guidance, clinics, it, was, also, in, this, time, period, that, he, finished, his, first, book, under, sail, through, red, devon, which, described, his, many, adventures, sailing, around, the, coastline, and, estuaries, of, south, devon, and, dartmoor, in, 1937, cattell, left, england, and, moved, to, the, united, states, when, he, was, invited, by, edward, thorndike, to, come, to, columbia, university, when, the, g, stanley, hall, professorship, in, psychology, became, available, at, clark, university, in, 1938, cattell, was, recommended, by, thorndike, and, was, appointed, to, the, position, however, he, conducted, little, research, there, and, was, continually, depressed, cattell, was, invited, by, gordon, allport, to, join, the, harvard, university, faculty, in, 1941, while, at, harvard, he, began, some, of, the, research, in, personality, that, would, become, the, foundation, for, much, of, his, later, scientific, work, during, world, war, ii, cattell, served, as, a, civilian, consultant, to, the, u, s, government, researching, and, developing, tests, for, selecting, officers, in, the, armed, forces, cattell, returned, to, teaching, at, harvard, and, married, alberta, karen, schuettler, a, phd, student, in, mathematics, at, radcliffe, college, over, the, years, she, worked, with, cattell, on, many, aspects, of, his, research, writing, and, test, development, they, had, three, daughters, and, a, son, they, divorced, in, 1980, herbert, woodrow, professor, of, psychology, at, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, was, searching, for, someone, with, a, background, in, multivariate, methods, to, establish, a, research, laboratory, cattell, was, invited, to, assume, this, position, in, 1945, with, this, newly, created, research, professorship, in, psychology, he, was, able, to, obtain, sufficient, grant, support, for, two, phd, associates, four, graduate, research, assistants, and, clerical, assistance, one, reason, that, cattell, moved, to, the, university, of, illinois, was, because, the, first, electronic, computer, built, and, owned, entirely, by, a, us, educational, institution, illinois, automatic, computer, was, being, developed, there, which, made, it, possible, for, him, to, complete, large, scale, factor, analyses, cattell, founded, the, laboratory, of, personality, assessment, and, group, behavior, in, 1949, he, and, his, wife, founded, the, institute, for, personality, and, ability, testing, ipat, karen, cattell, served, as, director, of, ipat, until, 1993, cattell, remained, in, the, illinois, research, professorship, until, he, reached, the, university, s, mandatory, retirement, age, in, 1973, a, few, years, after, he, retired, from, the, university, of, illinois, he, built, a, home, in, boulder, colorado, where, he, wrote, and, published, the, results, of, a, variety, of, research, projects, that, had, been, left, unfinished, in, illinois, in, 1977, cattell, moved, to, hawaii, largely, because, of, his, love, of, the, ocean, and, sailing, he, continued, his, career, as, a, part, time, professor, and, adviser, at, the, university, of, hawaii, he, also, served, as, adjunct, faculty, of, the, hawaii, school, of, professional, psychology, after, settling, in, hawaii, he, married, heather, birkett, a, clinical, psychologist, who, later, carried, out, extensive, research, using, the, 16pf, and, other, tests, during, the, last, two, decades, of, his, life, in, hawaii, cattell, continued, to, publish, a, variety, of, scientific, articles, as, well, as, books, on, motivation, the, scientific, use, of, factor, analysis, two, volumes, of, personality, and, learning, theory, the, inheritance, of, personality, and, co, edited, a, book, on, functional, psychological, testing, as, well, as, a, complete, revision, of, his, highly, renowned, handbook, of, multivariate, experimental, psychology, cattell, and, heather, birkett, cattell, lived, on, a, lagoon, in, the, southeast, corner, of, oahu, where, he, kept, a, small, sailing, boat, around, 1990, he, had, to, give, up, his, sailing, career, because, of, navigational, challenges, resulting, from, old, age, he, died, at, home, in, honolulu, on, 2, february, 1998, at, age, 92, years, he, is, buried, in, the, valley, of, the, temples, on, a, hillside, overlooking, the, sea, his, will, provided, for, his, remaining, funds, to, build, a, school, for, underprivileged, children, in, cambodia, he, was, an, agnostic, when, cattell, began, his, career, in, psychology, in, the, 1920s, he, felt, that, the, domain, of, personality, was, dominated, by, speculative, ideas, that, were, largely, intuitive, with, little, no, empirical, research, basis, cattell, accepted, e, l, thorndike, s, empiricist, viewpoint, that, if, something, actually, did, exist, it, existed, in, some, amount, and, hence, could, be, measured, cattell, found, that, constructs, used, by, early, psychological, theorists, tended, to, be, somewhat, subjective, and, poorly, defined, for, example, after, examining, over, 400, published, papers, on, the, topic, of, anxiety, in, 1965, cattell, stated, the, studies, showed, so, many, fundamentally, different, meanings, used, for, anxiety, and, different, ways, of, measuring, it, that, the, studies, could, not, even, be, integrated, early, personality, theorists, tended, to, provide, little, objective, evidence, or, research, bases, for, their, theories, cattell, wanted, psychology, to, become, more, like, other, sciences, whereby, a, theory, could, be, tested, in, an, objective, way, that, could, be, understood, and, replicated, by, others, in, cattell, s, words, emeritus, professor, arthur, b, sweney, an, expert, in, psychometric, test, construction, summed, up, cattell, s, methodology, also, according, to, sheehy, 2004, p, 62, in, 1994, cattell, was, one, of, 52, signatories, of, mainstream, science, on, intelligence, an, editorial, written, by, linda, gottfredson, and, published, in, the, wall, street, journal, in, the, letter, the, signers, some, of, whom, were, intelligence, researchers, defended, the, publication, of, the, book, the, bell, curve, there, was, sharp, pushback, on, the, letter, with, a, number, of, signers, not, cattell, having, received, funding, from, white, supremacist, organizations, his, works, can, be, categorized, or, defined, as, part, of, cognitive, psychology, due, to, his, nature, to, measure, every, psychological, aspect, especially, personality, aspect, rather, than, pursue, a, univariate, research, approach, to, psychology, studying, the, effect, that, a, single, variable, such, as, dominance, might, have, on, another, variable, such, as, decision, making, cattell, pioneered, the, use, of, multivariate, experimental, psychology, the, analysis, of, several, variables, simultaneously, he, believed, that, behavioral, dimensions, were, too, complex, and, interactive, to, fully, understand, variables, in, isolation, the, classical, univariate, approach, required, bringing, the, individual, into, an, artificial, laboratory, situation, and, measuring, the, effect, of, one, particular, variable, on, another, also, known, as, the, bivariate, approach, while, the, multivariate, approach, allowed, psychologists, to, study, the, whole, person, and, their, unique, combination, of, traits, within, a, natural, environmental, context, multivariate, experimental, research, designs, and, multivariate, statistical, analyses, allowed, for, the, study, of, real, life, situations, e, g, depression, divorce, loss, that, could, not, be, manipulated, in, an, artificial, laboratory, environment, cattell, applied, multivariate, research, methods, across, several, intrapersonal, psychological, domains, the, trait, constructs, both, normal, and, abnormal, of, personality, motivational, or, dynamic, traits, emotional, and, mood, states, as, well, as, the, diverse, array, of, cognitive, abilities, in, each, of, these, domains, he, considered, there, must, be, a, finite, number, of, basic, unitary, dimensions, that, could, be, identified, empirically, he, drew, a, comparison, between, these, fundamental, underlying, source, traits, and, the, basic, dimensions, of, the, physical, world, that, were, discovered, and, presented, for, example, in, the, periodic, table, of, chemical, elements, in, 1960, cattell, organized, and, convened, an, international, symposium, to, increase, communication, and, cooperation, among, researchers, who, were, using, multivariate, statistics, to, study, human, behavior, this, resulted, in, the, foundation, of, the, society, of, multivariate, experimental, psychology, smep, and, its, flagship, journal, multivariate, behavioral, research, he, brought, many, researchers, from, europe, asia, africa, australia, and, south, america, to, work, in, his, lab, at, the, university, of, illinois, many, of, his, books, involving, multivariate, experimental, research, were, written, in, collaboration, with, notable, colleagues, cattell, noted, that, in, the, hard, sciences, such, as, chemistry, physics, astronomy, as, well, as, in, medical, science, unsubstantiated, theories, were, historically, widespread, until, new, instruments, were, developed, to, improve, scientific, observation, and, measurement, in, the, 1920s, cattell, worked, with, charles, spearman, who, was, developing, the, new, statistical, technique, of, factor, analysis, in, his, effort, to, understand, the, basic, dimensions, and, structure, of, human, abilities, factor, analysis, became, a, powerful, tool, to, help, uncover, the, basic, dimensions, underlying, a, confusing, array, of, surface, variables, within, a, particular, domain, factor, analysis, was, built, upon, the, earlier, development, of, the, correlation, coefficient, which, provides, a, numerical, estimate, of, the, degree, to, which, variables, are, co, related, for, example, if, frequency, of, exercise, and, blood, pressure, level, were, measured, on, a, large, group, of, people, then, intercorrelating, these, two, variables, would, provide, a, quantitative, estimate, of, the, degree, to, which, exercise, and, blood, pressure, are, directly, related, to, each, other, factor, analysis, performs, complex, calculations, on, the, correlation, coefficients, among, the, variables, within, a, particular, domain, such, as, cognitive, ability, or, personality, trait, constructs, to, determine, the, basic, unitary, factors, underlying, the, particular, domain, while, working, at, the, university, of, london, with, spearman, exploring, the, number, and, nature, of, human, abilities, cattell, postulated, that, factor, analysis, could, be, applied, to, other, areas, beyond, the, domain, of, abilities, in, particular, cattell, was, interested, in, exploring, the, basic, taxonomic, dimensions, and, structure, of, human, personality, he, believed, that, if, exploratory, factor, analysis, were, applied, to, a, wide, range, of, measures, of, interpersonal, functioning, the, basic, dimensions, within, the, domain, of, social, behavior, could, be, identified, thus, factor, analysis, could, be, used, to, discover, the, fundamental, dimensions, underlying, the, large, number, of, surface, behaviors, thereby, facilitating, more, effective, research, as, noted, above, cattell, made, many, important, innovative, contributions, to, factor, analytic, methodology, including, the, scree, test, to, estimate, the, optimal, number, of, factors, to, extract, the, procrustes, oblique, rotation, strategy, the, coefficient, of, profile, similarity, p, technique, factor, analysis, dr, technique, factor, analysis, the, taxonome, program, as, well, the, rotoplot, program, for, attaining, maximum, simple, structure, solutions, in, addition, many, eminent, researchers, received, their, grounding, in, factor, analytic, methodology, under, the, guidance, of, cattell, including, richard, gorsuch, an, authority, on, exploratory, factor, analytic, methods, in, order, to, apply, factor, analysis, to, personality, cattell, believed, it, was, necessary, to, sample, the, widest, possible, range, of, variables, he, specified, three, kinds, of, data, for, comprehensive, sampling, to, capture, the, full, range, of, personality, dimensions, in, order, for, a, personality, dimension, to, be, called, fundamental, and, unitary, cattell, believed, that, it, needed, to, be, found, in, factor, analyses, of, data, from, all, three, of, these, measurement, domains, thus, cattell, constructed, measures, of, a, wide, range, of, personality, traits, in, each, medium, l, data, q, data, t, data, he, then, conducted, a, programmatic, series, of, factor, analyses, on, the, data, derived, from, each, of, the, three, measurement, media, in, order, to, elucidate, the, dimensionality, of, human, personality, structure, with, the, help, of, many, colleagues, cattell, s, factor, analytic, studies, continued, over, several, decades, eventually, finding, at, least, 16, primary, trait, factors, underlying, human, personality, comprising, 15, personality, dimensions, and, one, cognitive, ability, dimension, factor, b, in, the, 16pf, he, decided, to, name, these, traits, with, letters, a, b, c, d, e, in, order, to, avoid, misnaming, these, newly, discovered, dimensions, or, inviting, confusion, with, existing, vocabulary, and, concepts, factor, analytic, studies, conducted, by, many, researchers, in, diverse, cultures, around, the, world, have, provided, substantial, support, for, the, validity, of, these, 16, trait, dimensions, in, order, to, measure, these, trait, constructs, across, different, age, ranges, cattell, constructed, q, data, instruments, that, included, the, sixteen, personality, factor, questionnaire, 16pf, for, adults, the, high, school, personality, questionnaire, hspq, now, named, the, adolescent, personality, questionnaire, apq, and, the, children, s, personality, questionnaire, cpq, cattell, also, constructed, the, t, data, objective, analytic, battery, oab, that, provided, measures, of, the, 10, largest, personality, trait, factors, extracted, factor, analytically, as, well, as, objective, t, data, measures, of, dynamic, trait, constructs, such, as, the, motivation, analysis, test, mat, the, school, motivation, analysis, test, smat, and, the, children, s, motivation, analysis, test, cmat, in, order, to, measure, trait, constructs, within, the, abnormal, personality, sphere, cattell, constructed, the, clinical, analysis, questionnaire, caq, part, 1, of, the, caq, measures, the, 16pf, factors, while, part, 2, measures, an, additional, 12, abnormal, psychopathological, personality, trait, dimensions, the, caq, was, later, re, badged, as, the, psycheval, personality, questionnaire, pepq, also, within, the, broadly, conceptualized, personality, domain, cattell, constructed, measures, of, mood, states, and, transitory, emotional, states, including, the, eight, state, questionnaire, 8sq, in, addition, cattell, was, at, the, forefront, in, constructing, the, central, trait, state, kit, from, the, very, beginning, of, his, academic, career, cattell, reasoned, that, as, in, other, scientific, domains, like, intelligence, there, might, be, an, additional, higher, level, of, organization, within, personality, which, would, provide, a, structure, for, the, many, primary, traits, when, he, factor, analyzed, the, intercorrelations, of, the, 16, primary, trait, measures, themselves, he, found, no, fewer, than, five, second, order, or, global, factors, now, commonly, known, as, the, big, five, these, second, stratum, or, global, traits, are, conceptualized, as, broad, overarching, domains, of, behavior, which, provide, meaning, and, structure, for, the, primary, traits, for, example, the, global, trait, extraversion, has, emerged, from, factor, analytic, results, comprising, the, five, primary, trait, factors, that, are, interpersonal, in, focus, thus, global, extraversion, is, fundamentally, defined, by, the, primary, traits, that, are, grouped, together, factor, analytically, and, moving, in, the, opposite, direction, the, second, order, extraversion, factor, gives, conceptual, meaning, and, structure, to, these, primary, traits, identifying, their, focus, and, function, in, human, personality, these, two, levels, of, personality, structure, can, provide, an, integrated, understanding, of, the, whole, person, with, the, global, traits, giving, an, overview, of, the, individual, s, functioning, in, a, broad, brush, way, and, the, more, specific, primary, trait, scores, providing, an, in, depth, detailed, picture, of, the, individual, s, unique, trait, combinations, cattell, s, depth, psychometry, p, 71, research, into, the, 16pf, personality, factors, has, shown, these, constructs, to, be, useful, in, understanding, and, predicting, a, wide, range, of, real, life, behaviors, thus, the, 16, primary, trait, measures, plus, the, five, major, second, stratum, factors, have, been, used, in, educational, settings, to, study, and, predict, achievement, motivation, learning, or, cognitive, style, creativity, and, compatible, career, choices, in, work, or, employment, settings, to, predict, leadership, style, interpersonal, skills, creativity, conscientiousness, stress, management, and, accident, proneness, in, medical, settings, to, predict, heart, attack, proneness, pain, management, variables, likely, compliance, with, medical, instructions, or, recovery, pattern, from, burns, or, organ, transplants, in, clinical, settings, to, predict, self, esteem, interpersonal, needs, frustration, tolerance, and, openness, to, change, and, in, research, settings, to, predict, a, wide, range, of, behavioral, proclivities, such, as, aggression, conformity, and, authoritarianism, cattell, s, programmatic, multivariate, research, which, extended, from, the, 1940s, through, the, 70, s, resulted, in, several, books, that, have, been, widely, recognized, as, identifying, fundamental, taxonomic, dimensions, of, human, personality, and, motivation, and, their, organizing, principles, the, books, listed, above, document, a, programmatic, series, of, empirical, research, studies, based, on, quantitative, personality, data, derived, from, objective, tests, t, data, from, self, report, questionnaires, q, data, and, from, observer, ratings, l, data, they, present, a, theory, of, personality, development, over, the, human, life, span, including, effects, on, the, individual, s, behavior, from, family, social, cultural, biological, and, genetic, influences, as, well, as, influences, from, the, domains, of, motivation, and, ability, as, hans, eysenck, at, the, institute, of, psychiatry, london, remarked, cattell, has, been, one, of, the, most, prolific, writers, in, psychology, since, wilhelm, wundt, according, to, the, citation, index, he, is, one, of, the, ten, most, cited, psychologists, and, this, is, true, with, regard, to, not, only, citations, in, social, science, journals, but, also, those, in, science, journals, generally, of, the, two, hundred, and, fifty, most, cited, scientists, only, three, psychologists, made, the, grade, namely, sigmund, freud, in, the, first, place, then, the, reviewer, and, then, cattell, thus, there, is, no, question, that, cattell, has, made, a, tremendous, impression, on, psychology, and, science, in, general, william, h, tucker, and, barry, mehler, have, criticized, cattell, based, on, his, writings, about, evolution, and, political, systems, they, argue, that, cattell, adhered, to, a, mixture, of, eugenics, and, a, new, religion, of, his, devising, which, he, eventually, named, beyondism, and, proposed, as, a, new, morality, from, science, tucker, notes, that, cattell, thanked, the, prominent, neo, nazi, and, white, supremacist, ideologues, roger, pearson, wilmot, robertson, and, revilo, p, oliver, in, the, preface, to, his, beyondism, and, that, a, beyondist, newsletter, with, which, cattell, was, involved, favorably, reviewed, robertson, s, book, the, ethnostate, cattell, claimed, that, a, diversity, of, cultural, groups, was, necessary, to, allow, that, evolution, he, speculated, about, natural, selection, based, on, both, the, separation, of, groups, and, also, the, restriction, of, external, assistance, to, failing, groups, from, successful, ones, this, included, advocating, for, educational, and, voluntary, birth, control, measures, i, e, by, separating, groups, and, limiting, excessive, growth, of, failing, groups, john, gillis, argued, in, his, biography, of, cattell, that, although, some, of, cattell, s, views, were, controversial, tucker, and, mehler, exaggerated, and, misrepresented, his, views, by, taking, quotes, out, of, context, and, referring, to, outdated, writings, gillis, maintained, that, cattell, was, not, friends, with, white, supremacists, and, described, hitler, s, ideas, as, lunacy, in, 1997, cattell, was, chosen, by, the, american, psychological, association, apa, for, its, gold, medal, award, for, lifetime, achievement, in, the, science, of, psychology, before, the, medal, was, presented, mehler, launched, a, publicity, campaign, against, cattell, through, his, nonprofit, foundation, isar, accusing, cattell, of, being, sympathetic, to, racist, and, fascist, ideas, mehler, claimed, that, it, is, unconscionable, to, honor, this, man, whose, work, helps, to, dignify, the, most, destructive, political, ideas, of, the, twentieth, century, a, blue, ribbon, committee, was, convened, by, the, apa, to, investigate, the, legitimacy, of, the, charges, before, the, committee, reached, a, decision, cattell, issued, an, open, letter, to, the, committee, saying, i, believe, in, equal, opportunity, for, all, individuals, and, i, abhor, racism, and, discrimination, based, on, race, any, other, belief, would, be, antithetical, to, my, life, s, work, and, saying, that, it, is, unfortunate, that, the, apa, announcement, has, brought, misguided, critics, statements, a, great, deal, of, publicity, cattell, refused, the, award, withdrawing, his, name, from, consideration, and, the, committee, was, disbanded, cattell, died, months, later, at, the, age, of, 92, in, 1984, cattell, said, that, the, only, reasonable, thing, is, to, be, noncommittal, on, the, race, question, that, s, not, the, central, issue, and, it, would, be, a, great, mistake, to, be, sidetracked, into, all, the, emotional, upsets, that, go, on, in, discussions, of, racial, differences, we, should, be, quite, careful, to, dissociate, eugenics, from, it, eugenics, real, concern, should, be, with, individual, differences, richard, l, gorsuch, 1997, wrote, in, a, letter, to, the, american, psychological, foundation, para, 4, that, the, charge, of, racism, is, 180, degrees, off, track, was, the, first, one, to, challenge, the, racial, bias, in, tests, and, to, attempt, to, reduce, that, problem, raymond, cattell, s, papers, and, books, are, the, 7th, most, highly, referenced, in, peer, reviewed, psychology, journals, over, the, past, century, some, of, his, most, cited, publications,
