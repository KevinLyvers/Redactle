led, qing, dynasty, 1720, 1912, during, the, dalai, lama, s, recognition, process, the, cultural, anthropologist, melvyn, goldstein, writes, that, everything, the, tibetans, did, during, the,

press, falsely, claiming, that, wu, personally, announced, the, installation, of, the, dalai, lama, who, supposedly, prostrated, himself, to, wu, in, gratitude, after, his, enthronement, the, dalai, lama, s, childhood, was, then, spent, between, the, potala, palace, and, norbulingka, his, summer, residence, both, of, which, are, now, unesco, world, heritage, sites, chiang, kai, shek, ordered, ma, bufang, to, put, his, muslim, soldiers, on, alert, for, an, invasion, of, tibet, in, 1942, ma, bufang, complied, and, moved, several, thousand, troops, to, the, border, with, tibet, chiang, also,

the, labrang, monastery, in, october, 1950, the, army, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, marched, to, the, edge, of, the, dalai, lama, s, territory, and, sent, a, delegation, after, defeating, a, legion, of, the, tibetan, army, in, warlord, controlled, kham, on, 17, november, 1950, at, the, age, of, 15, the, 14th, dalai, lama, assumed, full, temporal, political, power, as, ruler, of, tibet, the, dalai, lama, s, formal, rule, as, head, of, the, government, in, tibet, was, brief, although, he, was, enthroned, as, spiritual, leader, on, 22, february, 1940, when, chinese, cadres, entered, tibet, in, 1950, with, a, crisis, looming, the, dalai, lama, was, asked, to, assume, the, role, of, head, of, state, at, the, age, of, 15, which, he, did, on, 17, november, 1950, customarily, the, dalai, lama, would, typically, assume, control, at, about, the, age, of, 20, he, sent, a, delegation, to, beijing, which, ratified, the, seventeen, point, agreement, without, his, authorisation, in, 1951, the, dalai, lama, believes, the, draft, agreement, was, written, by, china, tibetan, representatives, were, not, allowed, to, suggest, any, alterations, and, china, did, not, allow, the, tibetan, representatives, to, communicate, with, the, tibetan, government, in, lhasa, the, tibetan, delegation, was, not, authorised, by, lhasa, to, sign, but, ultimately, submitted, to, pressure, from, the, chinese, to, sign, anyway, using, seals, specifically, made, for, the, purpose, the, seventeen, point, agreement, recognised, chinese, sovereignty, over, tibet, but, china, allowed, the, dalai, lama, to, continue, to, rule, tibet, internally, and, it, allowed, the, system, of, feudal, peasantry, to, persist, scholar, robert, barnett, wrote, of, the, serfdom, controversy, so, even, if, it, were, agreed, that, serfdom, and, feudalism, existed, in, tibet, this, would, be, little, different, other, than, in, technicalities, from, conditions, in, any, other, premodern, peasant, society, including, most, of, china, at, that, time, the, power, of, the, chinese, argument, therefore, lies, in, its, implication, that, serfdom, and, with, it, feudalism, is, inseparable, from, extreme, abuse, evidence, to, support, this, linkage, has, not, been, found, by, scholars, other, than, those, close, to, chinese, governmental, circles, goldstein, for, example, notes, that, although, the, system, was, based, on, serfdom, it, was, not, necessarily, feudal, and, he, refutes, any, automatic, link, with, extreme, abuse, the, 19, year, old, dalai, lama, toured, china, for, almost, a, year, from, 1954, to, 1955, meeting, many, of, the, revolutionary, leaders, and, the, top, echelon, of, the, chinese, communist, leadership, who, created, modern, china, he, learned, chinese, and, socialist, ideals, as, explained, by, his, chinese, hosts, on, a, tour, of, china, showcasing, the, benefits, of, socialism, and, the, effective, governance, provided, to, turn, the, large, impoverished, nation, into, a, modern, and, egalitarian, society, which, impressed, him, in, september, 1954, he, went, to, the, chinese, capital, to, meet, chairman, mao, zedong, with, the, 10th, panchen, lama, and, attend, the, first, session, of, the, national, people, s, congress, as, a, delegate, primarily, discussing, china, s, constitution, on, 27, september, 1954, the, dalai, lama, was, selected, as, a, vice, chairman, of, the, standing, committee, of, the, national, people, s, congress, a, post, he, officially, held, until, 1964, mao, zedong, who, according, to, the, tibetan, leader, treated, him, as, a, father, would, treat, a, son, also, showed, tibet, s, political, leader, and, its, foremost, spiritual, master, its, ambivalence, to, tibetan, buddhism, the, dalai, lama, recounts, this, episode, in, his, autobiography, my, land, and, my, people, a, few, days, later, i, had, a, message, from, mao, tse, tung, to, say, that, he, was, coming, to, see, me, in, an, hour, s, time, when, he, arrived, he, said, he, had, merely, come, to, call, then, something, made, him, say, that, buddhism, was, quite, a, good, religion, and, lord, buddha, although, he, was, a, prince, had, given, a, good, deal, of, thought, to, the, question, of, improving, the, conditions, of, the, people, he, also, observed, that, the, goddess, tara, was, a, kind, hearted, woman, after, a, very, few, minutes, he, left, i, was, quite, bewildered, by, these, remarks, and, did, not, know, what, to, make, of, them, the, comments, mao, made, during, their, last, meeting, shocked, the, dalai, lama, beyond, belief, my, final, interview, with, this, remarkable, man, was, toward, the, end, of, my, visit, to, china, i, was, at, a, meeting, of, the, standing, committee, of, the, national, assembly, when, i, received, a, message, asking, me, to, go, to, see, him, at, this, house, by, then, i, had, been, able, to, complete, a, tour, of, the, chinese, provinces, and, i, was, able, to, tell, him, truthfully, that, i, had, been, greatly, impressed, and, interested, by, all, the, development, projects, i, had, seen, then, he, started, to, give, me, a, long, lecture, about, the, true, form, of, democracy, and, advised, me, how, to, become, a, leader, of, the, people, and, how, to, take, heed, of, their, suggestions, and, then, he, edged, closer, to, me, on, his, chair, and, whispered, i,

and, panel, discussions, the, dalai, lama, s, best, known, teaching, subject, is, the, kalachakra, tantra, which, as, of, 2014, he, had, conferred, a, total, of, 33, times, most, often, in, india, s, upper, himalayan, regions, but, also, in, the, western, world, the, kalachakra, wheel, of, time, is, one, of, the, most, complex, teachings, of, buddhism, sometimes, taking, two, weeks, to, confer, and, he, often, confers, it, on, very, large, audiences, up, to, 200, 000, students, and, disciples, at, a, time, the, dalai, lama, is, the, author, of, numerous, books, on, buddhism, many, of, them,

expresses, his, belief, that, if, we, only, reserve, compassion, for, those, that, we, love, we, are, ignoring, the, responsibility, of, sharing, these, characteristics, of, respect, and, empathy, with, those, we, do, not, have, relationships, with, which, cannot, allow, us, to, cultivate, love, he, elaborates, upon, this, idea, by, writing, that, although, it, takes, time, to, develop, a,

frequently, accepts, requests, from, students, to, visit, various, countries, worldwide, in, order, to, give, teachings, to, large, buddhist, audiences, teachings, that, are, usually, based, on,

tradition, of, nalanda, monastery, in, ancient, india, since, the, texts, written, by, those, 17, nalanda, pandits, or, masters, to, whom, he, has, composed, a, poem, of, invocation, were, brought,

ladakh, the, dalai, lama, s, lifelong, interest, in, science, and, technology, dates, from, his, childhood, in, lhasa, tibet, when, he, was, fascinated, by, mechanical, objects, like, clocks, watches, telescopes, film, projectors, clockwork, soldiers, and, motor, cars, and, loved, to, repair, disassemble, and, reassemble, them, once, observing, the, moon, through, a, telescope, as, a, child, he, realised, it, was, a, crater, pocked, lump, of, rock, and, not, a, heavenly, body, emitting, its, own, light, as, tibetan, cosmologists, had, taught, him, he, has, also, said, that, had, he, not, been, brought, up, as, a, monk, he, would, probably, have, been, an, engineer, on, his, first, trip, to, the, west, in, 1973, he, asked, to, visit, cambridge, university, s, astrophysics, department, in, the, uk, and, he, sought, out, renowned, scientists, such, as, sir, karl, popper, david, bohm, and, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, who, taught, him, the, basics, of, science, the, dalai, lama, sees, important, common, ground, between, science, and, buddhism, in, having, the, same, approach, to, challenge, dogma, on, the, basis, of, empirical, evidence, that, comes, from, observation, and, analysis, of, phenomena, his, growing, wish, to, develop, meaningful, scientific, dialogue, to, explore, the, buddhism, and, science, interface, led, to, invitations, for, him, to, attend, relevant, conferences, on, his, visits, to, the, west, including, the, alpbach, symposia, on, consciousness, in, 1983, where, he, met, and, had, discussions, with, the, late, chilean, neuroscientist, francisco, j, varela, also, in, 1983, the, american, social, entrepreneur, and, innovator, r, adam, engle, who, had, become, aware, of, the, dalai, lama, s, deep, interest, in, science, was, already, considering, the, idea, of, facilitating, for, him, a, serious, dialogue, with, a, selection, of, appropriate, scientists, in, 1984, engle, formally, offered, to, the, dalai, lama, s, office, to, organise, a, week, long, formal, dialogue, for, him, with, a, suitable, team, of, scientists, provided, that, the, dalai, lama, would, wish, to, fully, participate, in, such, a, dialogue, within, 48, hours, the, dalai, lama, confirmed, to, engle, that, he, was, truly, interested, in, participating, in, something, substantial, about, science, so, engle, proceeded, with, launching, the, project, francisco, varela, having, heard, about, engle, s, proposal, then, called, him, to, tell, him, of, his, earlier, discussions, with, the, dalai, lama, and, to, offer, his, scientific, collaboration, to, the, project, engle, accepted, and, varela, assisted, him, to, assemble, his, team, of, six, specialist, scientists, for, the, first, mind, and, life, dialogue, on, the, cognitive, sciences, which, was, eventually, held, with, the, dalai, lama, at, his, residence, in, dharamsala, in, 1987, this, five, day, event, was, so, successful, that, at, the, end, the, dalai, lama, told, engle, he, would, very, much, like, to, repeat, it, again, in, the, future, engle, then, started, work, on, arranging, a, second, dialogue, this, time, with, neuroscientists, in, california, and, the, discussions, from, the, first, event, were, edited, and, published, as, mind, and, life, s, first, book, gentle, bridges, conversations, with, the, dalai, lama, on, the, sciences, of, mind, as, mind, and, life, institute, s, remit, expanded, engle, formalised, the, organisation, as, a, non, profit, foundation, after, the, third, dialogue, held, in, 1990, which, initiated, the, undertaking, of, neurobiological, research, programmes, in, the, united, states, under, scientific, conditions, over, the, following, decades, as, of, 2014, at, least, 28, dialogues, between, the, dalai, lama, and, panels, of, various, world, renowned, scientists, have, followed, held, in, various, countries, and, covering, diverse, themes, from, the, nature, of, consciousness, to, cosmology, and, from, quantum, mechanics, to, the, neuroplasticity, of, the, brain, sponsors, and, partners, in, these, dialogues, have, included, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, johns, hopkins, university, the, mayo, clinic, and, zurich, university, apart, from, time, spent, teaching, buddhism, and, fulfilling, responsibilities, to, his, tibetan, followers, the, dalai, lama, has, probably, spent, and, continues, to, spend, more, of, his, time, and, resources, investigating, the, interface, between, buddhism, and, science, through, the, ongoing, series, of, mind, and, life, dialogues, and, its, spin, offs, than, on, any, other, single, activity, as, the, institute, s, cofounder, and, the, honorary, chairman, he, has, personally, presided, over, and, participated, in, all, its, dialogues, which, continue, to, expand, worldwide, these, activities, have, given, rise, to, dozens, of, dvd, sets, of, the, dialogues, and, books, he, has, authored, on, them, such, as, ethics, for, the, new, millennium, and, the, universe, in, a, single, atom, as, well, as, scientific, papers, and, university, research, programmes, on, the, tibetan, and, buddhist, side, science, subjects, have, been, added, to, the, curriculum, for, tibetan, monastic, educational, institutions, and, scholarship, on, the, western, side, university, and, research, programmes, initiated, by, these, dialogues, and,

see, learning, focuses, on, developing, critical, thinking, ethical, reasoning, and, compassion, and, stresses, on, commonalities, rather, than, on, the, differences, in, particular, the, mind, and, life, education, humanities, social, sciences, initiatives, have, been, instrumental, in, developing, the, emerging, field, of, contemplative, science, by, researching, for, example, the, effects, of, contemplative, practice, on, the, human, brain, behaviour, and, biology, in, his, 2005, book, the, universe, in, a, single, atom, and, elsewhere, and, to, mark, his, commitment, to, scientific, truth, and, its, ultimate, ascendancy, over, religious, belief, unusually, for, a, major, religious, leader, the, dalai, lama, advises, his, buddhist, followers, if, scientific, analysis, were, conclusively, to, demonstrate, certain, claims, in, buddhism, to, be, false, then, we, must, accept, the, findings, of, science, and, abandon, those, claims, he, has, also, cited, examples, of, archaic, buddhist, ideas, he, has, abandoned, himself, on, this, basis, these, activities, have, even, had, an, impact, in, the, chinese, capital, in, 2013, an, academic, dialogue, with, a, chinese, scientist, a, tibetan, living, buddha, and, a, professor, of, religion, took, place, in, beijing, entitled, high, end, dialogue, ancient, buddhism, and, modern, science, it, addressed, the, same, considerations, that, interest, the, dalai, lama, described, as, discussing, about, the, similarities, between, buddhism, and, modern, science, the, dalai, lama, uses, various, meditation, techniques, including, analytic, meditation, and, emptiness, meditation, he, has, said, that, the, aim, of, meditation, is, to, maintain, a, very, full, state, of, alertness, and, mindfulness, and, then, try, to, see, the, natural, state, of, your, consciousness, all, human, beings, have, an, innate, desire, to, overcome, suffering, to, find, happiness, training, the, mind, to, think, differently, through, meditation, is, one, important, way, to, avoid, suffering, and, be, happy, despite, initially, advocating, for, tibetan, independence, from, 1961, to, 1974, the, dalai, lama, no, longer, supports, it, instead, he, advocates, for, more, meaningful, autonomy, for, tibetans, within, the, people, s, republic, of, china, this, approach, is, known, as, the, middle, way, in, 2005, the, 14th, dalai, lama, emphasized, that, tibet, is, a, part, of, china, and, tibetan, culture, and, buddhism, are, part, of, chinese, culture, in, a, speech, at, kolkata, in, 2017, the, dalai, lama, stated, that, tibetans, wanted, to, stay, with, china, and, they, did, not, desire, independence, he, said, that, he, believed, that, china, after, opening, up, had, changed, 40, to, 50, per, cent, of, what, it, was,

in, the, world, people, think, of, animals, as, if, they, were, vegetables, and, that, is, not, right, we, have, to, change, the, way, people, think, about, animals, i, encourage, the, tibetan, people, and, all, people, to, move, toward, a, vegetarian, diet, that, doesn, t, cause, suffering, the, dalai, lama, advocates, compassion, for, animals, and, frequently, urges, people, to, try, vegetarianism, or, at, least, reduce, their, consumption, of, meat, in, tibet, where, historically, meat, was, the, most, common, food, most, monks, historically, have, been, omnivores, including, the, dalai, lamas, the, fourteenth, dalai, lama, was, raised, in, a, meat, eating, family, but, converted, to, vegetarianism, after, arriving, in, india, where, vegetables, are, much, more, easily, available, and, vegetarianism, is, widespread, he, spent, many, years, as, a, vegetarian, but, after, contracting, hepatitis, in, india, and, suffering, from, weakness, his, doctors, told, him, to, return, to, eating, meat, which, he, now, does, twice, a, week, this, attracted, public, attention, when, during, a, visit, to, the, white, house, he, was, offered, a, vegetarian, menu, but, declined, by, replying, as, he, is, known, to, do, on, occasion, when, dining, in, the, company, of, non, vegetarians, i, m, a, tibetan, monk, not, a, vegetarian, his, own, home, kitchen, however, is, completely, vegetarian, in, 2009, the, english, singer, paul, mccartney, wrote, a, letter, to, the, dalai, lama, inquiring, why, he, was, not, a, vegetarian, as, mccartney, later, told, the, guardian, he, wrote, back, very, kindly, saying, my, doctors, tell, me, that, i, must, eat, meat, and, i, wrote, back, again, saying, you, know, i, don, t, think, that, s, right, i, think, now, he, s, vegetarian, most, of, the, time, i, think, he, s, now, being, told, the, more, he, meets, doctors, from, the, west, that, he, can, get, his, protein, somewhere, else, it, just, doesn, t, seem, right, the, dalai, lama, on, the, one, hand, saying, hey, guys, don, t, harm, sentient, beings, oh, and, by, the, way, i, m, having, a, steak, the, dalai, lama, has, referred, to, himself, as, a, marxist, and, has, articulated, criticisms, of, capitalism, i, am, not, only, a, socialist, but, also, a, bit, leftist, a, communist, in, terms, of, social, economy, theory, i, am, a, marxist, i, think, i, am, farther, to, the, left, than, the, chinese, leaders, they, are, capitalists, he, reports, hearing, of, communism, when, he, was, very, young, but, only, in, the, context, of, the, destruction, of, the, mongolian, people, s, republic, it, was, only, when, he, went, on, his, trip, to, beijing, that, he, learned, about, marxist, theory, from, his, interpreter, baba, phuntsog, wangyal, of, the, tibetan, communist, party, at, that, time, he, reports, i, was, so, attracted, to, marxism, i, even, expressed, my, wish, to, become, a, communist, party, member, citing, his, favourite, concepts, of, self, sufficiency, and, equal, distribution, of, wealth, he, does, not, believe, that, china, implemented, true, marxist, policy, and, thinks, the, historical, communist, states, such, as, the, soviet, union, were, far, more, concerned, with, their, narrow, national, interests, than, with, the, workers, international, moreover, he, believes, one, flaw, of, historically, marxist, regimes, is, that, they, place, too, much, emphasis, on, destroying, the, ruling, class, and, not, enough, on, compassion, he, finds, marxism, superior, to, capitalism, believing, the, latter, is, only, concerned, with, how, to, make, profits, whereas, the, former, has, moral, ethics, stating, in, 1993, of, all, the, modern, economic, theories, the, economic, system, of, marxism, is, founded, on, moral, principles, while, capitalism, is, concerned, only, with, gain, and, profitability, marxism, is, concerned, with, the, distribution, of, wealth, on, an, equal, basis, and, the, equitable, utilisation, of, the, means, of, production, it, is, also, concerned, with, the, fate, of, the, working, classes, that, is, the, majority, as, well, as, with, the, fate, of, those, who, are, underprivileged, and, in, need, and, marxism, cares, about, the, victims, of, minority, imposed, exploitation, for, those, reasons, the, system, appeals, to, me, and, it, seems, fair, i, just, recently, read, an, article, in, a, paper, where, his, holiness, the, pope, also, pointed, out, some, positive, aspects, of, marxism, on, india, pakistan, relations, the, dalai, lama, in, october, 2019, said, there, is, a, difference, between, indian, and, pakistani, prime, minister, s, speech, at, the, un, indian, prime, prime, minister, talks, about, peace, and, you, know, what, his, pakistan, counterpart, said, getting, china, s, political, support, is, pakistan, s, compulsion, but, pakistan, also, needs, india, pakistani, leaders, should, calm, down, and, think, beyond, emotions, and, should, follow, a, realistic, approach, the, dalai, lama, is, outspoken, in, his, concerns, about, environmental, problems, frequently, giving, public, talks, on, themes, related, to, the, environment, he, has, pointed, out, that, many, rivers, in, asia, originate, in, tibet, and, that, the, melting, of, himalayan, glaciers, could, affect, the, countries, in, which, the, rivers, flow, he, acknowledged, official, chinese, laws, against, deforestation, in, tibet, but, lamented, they, can, be, ignored, due, to, possible, corruption, he, was, quoted, as, saying, ecology, should, be, part, of, our, daily, life, personally, he, takes, showers, instead, of, baths, and, turns, lights, off, when, he, leaves, a, room, around, 2005, he, started, campaigning, for, wildlife, conservation, including, by, issuing, a, religious, ruling, against, wearing, tiger, and, leopard, skins, as, garments, the, dalai, lama, supports, the, anti, whaling, position, in, the, whaling, controversy, but, has, criticised, the, activities, of, groups, such, as, the, sea, shepherd, conservation, society, which, carries, out, acts, of, what, it, calls, aggressive, nonviolence, against, property, before, the, 2009, united, nations, climate, change, conference, he, urged, national, leaders, to, put, aside, domestic, concerns, and, take, collective, action, against, climate, change, the, dalai, lama, s, stances, on, topics, of, sexuality, have, changed, over, time, a, monk, since, childhood, the, dalai, lama, has, said, that, sex, offers, fleeting, satisfaction, and, leads, to, trouble, later, while, chastity, offers, a, better, life, and, more, independence, more, freedom, he, has, said, that, problems, arising, from, conjugal, life, sometimes, even, lead, to, suicide, or, murder, he, has, asserted, that, all, religions, have, the, same, view, about, adultery, in, his, discussions, of, the, traditional, buddhist, view, on, appropriate, sexual, behaviour, he, explains, the, concept, of, right, organ, in, the, right, object, at, the, right, time, which, historically, has, been, interpreted, as, indicating, that, oral, manual, and, anal, sex, both, homosexual, and, heterosexual, are, not, appropriate, in, buddhism, or, for, buddhists, however, he, also, says, that, in, modern, times, all, common, consensual, sexual, practices, that, do, not, cause, harm, to, others, are, ethically, acceptable, and, that, society, should, accept, and, respect, people, who, are, gay, or, transgender, from, a, secular, point, of, view, in, a, 1994, interview, with, out, magazine, the, dalai, lama, clarified, his, personal, opinion, on, the, matter, by, saying, if, someone, comes, to, me, and, asks, whether, homosexuality, is, okay, or, not, i, will, ask, what, is, your, companion, s, opinion, if, you, both, agree, then, i, think, i, would, say, if, two, males, or, two, females, voluntarily, agree, to, have, mutual, satisfaction, without, further, implication, of, harming, others, then, it, is, okay, however, when, interviewed, by, canadian, tv, news, anchor, evan, solomon, on, cbc, news, sunday, about, whether, homosexuality, is, acceptable, in, buddhism, the, dalai, lama, responded, that, it, is, sexual, misconduct, in, his, 1996, book, beyond, dogma, he, described, a, traditional, buddhist, definition, of, an, appropriate, sexual, act, as, follows, a, sexual, act, is, deemed, proper, when, the, couples, use, the, organs, intended, for, sexual, intercourse, and, nothing, else, homosexuality, whether, it, is, between, men, or, between, women, is, not, improper, in, itself, what, is, improper, is, the, use, of, organs, already, defined, as, inappropriate, for, sexual, contact, he, elaborated, in, 1997, conceding, that, the, basis, of, that, teaching, was, unknown, to, him, he, also, conveyed, his, own, willingness, to, consider, the, possibility, that, some, of, the, teachings, may, be, specific, to, a, particular, cultural, and, historic, context, in, 2006, the, dalai, lama, has, expressed, concern, at, reports, of, violence, and, discrimination, against, lgbt, people, and, urged, respect, tolerance, and, the, full, recognition, of, human, rights, for, all,

it, however, he, also, stated, that, if, same, sex, marriage, is, in, contradiction, with, one, s, chosen, traditions, then, they, should, not, follow, it, in, 2007, he, said, that, the, next, dalai, lama, could, possibly, be, a, woman, if, a, woman, reveals, herself, as, more, useful, the, lama, could, very, well, be, reincarnated, in, this, form, in, 2009, on, gender, equality, and, sexism, the, dalai, lama, proclaimed, at, the, national, civil, rights, museum, in, memphis, tennessee, i, call, myself, a, feminist, isn, t, that, what, you, call, someone, who, fights, for, women, s, rights, he,

compassionate, world, citing, the, good, works, of, nurses, and, mothers, at, a, 2014, appearance, at, the, tata, institute, of, social, sciences, in, mumbai, the, dalai, lama, said, since, women,

female, must, be, attractive, otherwise, it, is, not, much, use, and, when, asked, if, he, was, joking, replied, no, true, he, followed, with, a, joke, about, his, success, being, due, to, his, own,

happens, to, one, person, can, soon, affect, every, other, being, but, it, also, reminds, us, that, a, compassionate, or, constructive, act, whether, working, in, hospitals, or, just, observing, social, distancing, has, the, potential, to, help, many, in, september, 2018, speaking, at, a, conference, in, malm, sweden, home, to, a, large, immigrant, population, the, dalai, lama, said, i, think, europe, belongs, to, the, europeans, but, also, that, europe, was, morally, responsible, for, helping, a, refugee, really, facing, danger, against, their, life, he, stated, that, europe, has, a, responsibility, to, refugees, to, receive, them, help, them, educate, them, but, that, they, should, aim, to, return, to, their, places, of, origin, and, that, they, ultimately, should, rebuild, their, own, country, speaking, to, german, reporters, in, 2016, the, dalai, lama, said, there, are, too, many, refugees, in, europe, adding, that, europe, for, example, germany, cannot, become, an,

decision, if, it, is, decided, that, the, reincarnation, of, the, dalai, lama, should, continue, and, there, is, a, need, for, the, fifteenth, dalai, lama, to, be, recognized, responsibility, for, doing, so, will, primarily, rest, on, the, concerned, officers, of, the, dalai, lama, s, gaden, phodrang, trust, they, should, consult, the, various, heads, of, the, tibetan, buddhist, traditions, and, the, reliable, oath, bound, dharma, protectors, who, are, linked, inseparably, to, the, lineage, of, the, dalai, lamas, they, should, seek, advice, and, direction, from, these, concerned, beings, and, carry, out, the, procedures, of, search, and, recognition, in, accordance, with, past, tradition, i, shall, leave, clear, written, instructions, about, this, bear, in, mind, that, apart, from, the, reincarnation, recognized, through, such, legitimate, methods, no, recognition, or, acceptance, should, be, given, to, a, candidate, chosen, for, political, ends, by, anyone, including, those, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, october, 2011, the, dalai, lama, repeated, his, statement, in, an, interview, with, canadian, ctv, news, he, added, that, chinese, laws, banning, the, selection, of, successors, based, on, reincarnation, will, not, impact, his, decisions, naturally, my, next, life, is, entirely, up, to, me, no, one, else, and, also, this, is, not, a, political, matter, he, said, in, the, interview, the, dalai, lama, also, added, that, he, has, not, decided, on, whether, he, would, reincarnate, or, be, the, last, dalai, lama, in, an, interview, with, the,

lama, for, almost, five, centuries, the, 14th, dalai, lama, now, is, very, popular, let, us, then, finish, with, a, popular, dalai, lama, gyatso, has, also, expressed, fear, that, the, chinese, government, would, manipulate, any, reincarnation, selection, in, order, to, choose, a, successor, that, would, go, along, with, their, political, goals, in, response, the, chinese, government, implied, that, it, would, select, another, dalai, lama, regardless, of, his, decision, in, october, 1998, the, dalai, lama, s, administration, acknowledged, that, it, received, 1, 7, million, a, year, in, the, 1960s, from, the, u, s, government, through, a, central, intelligence, agency, program, when, asked, by, cia, officer, john, kenneth, knaus, in, 1995, to, comment, on, the, cia, tibetan, program, the, dalai, lama, replied, that, though, it, helped, the, morale, of, those, resisting, the, chinese, thousands, of, lives, were, lost, in, the, resistance, and, further, that, the, u, s, government, had, involved, itself, in, his, country, s, affairs, not, to, help, tibet, but, only, as, a, cold, war, tactic, to, challenge, the, chinese, as, part, of, the, program, the, dalai, lama, received, 180, 000, dollars, a, year, from, 1959, till, 1974, for, his, own, personal, use, his, administration, s, reception, of, cia, funding, has, become, one, of, the, grounds, for, some, state, run, chinese, newspapers, to, discredit, him, along, with, the, tibetan, independence, movement, in, his, autobiography, freedom, in, exile, the, dalai, lama, criticised, the, cia, again, for, supporting, the, tibetan, independence, movement, not, because, they, the, cia, cared, about, tibetan, independence, but, as, part, of, their, worldwide, efforts, to, destabilize, all, communist, governments, in, 1999, the, dalai, lama, said, that, the, cia, tibetan, program, had, been, harmful, for, tibet, because, it, was, primarily, aimed, at, serving, american, interests, and, once, the, american, policy, toward, china, changed, they, stopped, their, help, the, chinese, communist, party, has, criticised, the, 14th, dalai, lama, for, his, close, ties, with, india, in, 2008, the, dalai, lama, said, that, arunachal, pradesh, partially, claimed, by, china, is, part, of, india, citing, the, disputed, 1914, simla, accord, in, 2010, at, the, international, buddhist, conference, in, gujarat, he, described, himself, as, a, son, of, india, and, tibetan, in, appearance, but, an, indian, in, spirituality, the, newspaper, of, the, central, committee, of, the, chinese, communist, party, people, s, daily, questioned, if, the, dalai, lama, by, considering, himself, indian, rather, than, chinese, is, still, entitled, to, represent, tibetans, alluding, to, the, links, between, chinese, and, tibetan, buddhism, and, the, dalai, lama, siding, with, india, on, southern, tibet, dhundup, gyalpo, the, dalai, lama, s, eventual, secretary, in, new, delhi, argued, that, tibetan, and, chinese, peoples, have, no, connections, apart, from, a, few, culinary, dishes, and, that, chinese, buddhists, could, also, be, deemed, indian, in, spirituality, because, both, tibetan, and, chinese, buddhism, originated, from, india, dorje, shugden, is, an, entity, in, tibetan, buddhism, that, since, the, 1930s, has, become, a, point, of, contention, over, whether, to, include, or, exclude, certain, non, gelug, teachings, after, the, 1975, publication, of, the, yellow, book, containing, stories, about, dorje, shugden, acting, wrathfully, against, gelugpas, who, also, practised, nyingma,
