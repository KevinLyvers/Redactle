charles, i, 19, november, 1600, 30, january, 1649, was, king, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, from, 27, march, 1625, until, his, execution, in, 1649, charles, was, born, into, the, house, of, stuart, as, the, second, son, of, king, james, vi, of, scotland, but, after, his, father, inherited, the, english, throne, in, 1603, he, moved, to, england, where, he, spent, much, of, the, rest, of, his, life, he, became, heir, apparent, to, the, kingdoms, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, in, 1612, upon, the, death, of, his, elder, brother, henry, frederick, prince, of, wales, an, unsuccessful, and, unpopular, attempt, to, marry, him, to, infanta, maria, anna, of, spain, culminated, in, an, eight, month, visit, to, spain, in, 1623, that, demonstrated, the, futility, of, the, marriage, negotiation, two, years, later, shortly, after, his, accession, he, married, henrietta, maria, of, france, after, his, succession, in, 1625, charles, quarrelled, with, the, english, parliament, which, sought, to, curb, his, royal, prerogative, he, believed, in, the, divine, right, of, kings, and, was, determined, to, govern, according, to, his, own, conscience, many, of, his, subjects, opposed, his, policies, in, particular, the, levying, of, taxes, without, parliamentary, consent, and, perceived, his, actions, as, those, of, a, tyrannical, absolute, monarch, his, religious, policies, coupled, with, his, marriage, to, a, roman, catholic, generated, antipathy, and, mistrust, from, reformed, religious, groups, such, as, the, english, puritans, and, scottish, covenanters, who, thought, his, views, too, catholic, he, supported, high, church, anglican, ecclesiastics, and, failed, to, aid, continental, protestant, forces, successfully, during, the, thirty, years, war, his, attempts, to, force, the, church, of, scotland, to, adopt, high, anglican, practices, led, to, the, bishops, wars, strengthened, the, position, of, the, english, and, scottish, parliaments, and, helped, precipitate, his, own, downfall, from, 1642, charles, fought, the, armies, of, the, english, and, scottish, parliaments, in, the, english, civil, war, after, his, defeat, in, 1645, at, the, hands, of, the, parliamentarian, new, model, army, he, fled, north, from, his, base, at, oxford, charles, surrendered, to, a, scottish, force, and, after, lengthy, negotiations, between, the, english, and, scottish, parliaments, he, was, handed, over, to, the, long, parliament, in, london, charles, refused, to, accept, his, captors, demands, for, a, constitutional, monarchy, and, temporarily, escaped, captivity, in, november, 1647, re, imprisoned, on, the, isle, of, wight, he, forged, an, alliance, with, scotland, but, by, the, end, of, 1648, the, new, model, army, had, consolidated, its, control, over, england, charles, was, tried, convicted, and, executed, for, high, treason, in, january, 1649, the, monarchy, was, abolished, and, the, commonwealth, of, england, was, established, as, a, republic, the, monarchy, would, be, restored, to, charles, s, son, charles, ii, in, 1660, the, second, son, of, king, james, vi, of, scotland, and, anne, of, denmark, charles, was, born, in, dunfermline, palace, fife, on, 19, november, 1600, at, a, protestant, ceremony, in, the, chapel, royal, of, holyrood, palace, in, edinburgh, on, 23, december, 1600, he, was, baptised, by, david, lindsay, bishop, of, ross, and, created, duke, of, albany, the, traditional, title, of, the, second, son, of, the, king, of, scotland, with, the, subsidiary, titles, of, marquess, of, ormond, earl, of, ross, and, lord, ardmannoch, james, vi, was, the, first, cousin, twice, removed, of, queen, elizabeth, i, of, england, and, when, she, died, childless, in, march, 1603, he, became, king, of, england, as, james, i, charles, was, a, weak, and, sickly, infant, and, while, his, parents, and, older, siblings, left, for, england, in, april, and, early, june, that, year, due, to, his, fragile, health, he, remained, in, scotland, with, his, father, s, friend, lord, fyvie, appointed, as, his, guardian, by, 1604, when, charles, was, three, and, a, half, he, was, able, to, walk, the, length, of, the, great, hall, at, dunfermline, palace, without, assistance, and, it, was, decided, that, he, was, strong, enough, to, journey, to, england, to, be, reunited, with, his, family, in, mid, july, 1604, he, left, dunfermline, for, england, where, he, was, to, spend, most, of, the, rest, of, his, life, in, england, charles, was, placed, under, the, charge, of, elizabeth, lady, carey, the, wife, of, courtier, sir, robert, carey, who, put, him, in, boots, made, of, spanish, leather, and, brass, to, help, strengthen, his, weak, ankles, his, speech, development, was, also, slow, and, he, had, a, stammer, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, january, 1605, charles, was, created, duke, of, york, as, is, customary, in, the, case, of, the, english, sovereign, s, second, son, and, made, a, knight, of, the, bath, thomas, murray, a, presbyterian, scot, was, appointed, as, a, tutor, charles, learnt, the, usual, subjects, of, classics, languages, mathematics, and, religion, in, 1611, he, was, made, a, knight, of, the, garter, eventually, charles, apparently, conquered, his, physical, infirmity, which, might, have, been, caused, by, rickets, he, became, an, adept, horseman, and, marksman, and, took, up, fencing, even, so, his, public, profile, remained, low, in, contrast, to, that, of, his, physically, stronger, and, taller, elder, brother, henry, frederick, prince, of, wales, whom, charles, adored, and, attempted, to, emulate, but, in, early, november, 1612, henry, died, at, the, age, of, 18, of, what, is, suspected, to, have, been, typhoid, or, possibly, porphyria, charles, who, turned, 12, two, weeks, later, became, heir, apparent, as, the, eldest, surviving, son, of, the, sovereign, he, automatically, gained, several, titles, including, duke, of, cornwall, and, duke, of, rothesay, in, november, 1616, he, was, created, prince, of, wales, and, earl, of, chester, in, 1613, charles, s, sister, elizabeth, married, frederick, v, elector, palatine, and, moved, to, heidelberg, in, 1617, the, habsburg, archduke, ferdinand, of, austria, a, catholic, was, elected, king, of, bohemia, the, next, year, the, bohemians, rebelled, defenestrating, the, catholic, governors, in, august, 1619, the, bohemian, diet, chose, frederick, who, led, the, protestant, union, as, their, monarch, while, ferdinand, was, elected, holy, roman, emperor, in, the, imperial, election, frederick, s, acceptance, of, the, bohemian, crown, in, defiance, of, the, emperor, marked, the, beginning, of, the, turmoil, that, would, develop, into, the, thirty, years, war, the, conflict, originally, confined, to, bohemia, spiralled, into, a, wider, european, war, which, the, english, parliament, and, public, quickly, grew, to, see, as, a, polarised, continental, struggle, between, catholics, and, protestants, in, 1620, king, frederick, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, white, mountain, near, prague, and, his, hereditary, lands, in, the, electoral, palatinate, were, invaded, by, a, habsburg, force, from, the, spanish, netherlands, james, however, had, been, seeking, marriage, between, prince, charles, and, ferdinand, s, niece, infanta, maria, anna, of, spain, and, began, to, see, the, spanish, match, as, a, possible, diplomatic, means, of, achieving, peace, in, europe, unfortunately, for, james, negotiation, with, spain, proved, unpopular, with, both, the, public, and, james, s, court, the, english, parliament, was, actively, hostile, towards, spain, and, catholicism, and, thus, when, called, by, james, in, 1621, the, members, hoped, for, an, enforcement, of, recusancy, laws, a, naval, campaign, against, spain, and, a, protestant, marriage, for, the, prince, of, wales, james, s, lord, chancellor, francis, bacon, was, impeached, before, the, house, of, lords, for, corruption, the, impeachment, was, the, first, since, 1459, without, the, king, s, official, sanction, in, the, form, of, a, bill, of, attainder, the, incident, set, an, important, precedent, as, the, process, of, impeachment, would, later, be, used, against, charles, and, his, supporters, the, duke, of, buckingham, archbishop, william, laud, and, the, earl, of, strafford, james, insisted, that, the, house, of, commons, be, concerned, exclusively, with, domestic, affairs, while, the, members, protested, that, they, had, the, privilege, of, free, speech, within, the, commons, walls, demanding, war, with, spain, and, a, protestant, princess, of, wales, like, his, father, charles, considered, discussion, of, his, marriage, in, the, commons, impertinent, and, an, infringement, of, his, father, s, royal, prerogative, in, january, 1622, james, dissolved, parliament, angry, at, what, he, perceived, as, the, members, impudence, and, intransigence, charles, and, buckingham, james, s, favourite, and, a, man, who, had, great, influence, over, the, prince, travelled, incognito, to, spain, in, february, 1623, to, try, to, reach, agreement, on, the, long, pending, spanish, match, the, trip, was, an, embarrassing, failure, the, infanta, thought, charles, little, more, than, an, infidel, and, the, spanish, at, first, demanded, that, he, convert, to, catholicism, as, a, condition, of, the, match, they, insisted, on, toleration, of, catholics, in, england, and, the, repeal, of, the, english, penal, laws, which, charles, knew, parliament, would, not, agree, to, and, that, the, infanta, remain, in, spain, for, a, year, after, any, wedding, to, ensure, that, england, complied, with, all, the, treaty, s, terms, a, personal, quarrel, erupted, between, buckingham, and, the, count, of, olivares, the, spanish, chief, minister, and, so, charles, conducted, the, ultimately, futile, negotiations, personally, when, he, returned, to, london, in, october, without, a, bride, and, to, a, rapturous, and, relieved, public, welcome, he, and, buckingham, pushed, the, reluctant, james, to, declare, war, on, spain, with, the, encouragement, of, his, protestant, advisers, james, summoned, the, english, parliament, in, 1624, to, request, subsidies, for, a, war, charles, and, buckingham, supported, the, impeachment, of, the, lord, treasurer, lionel, cranfield, 1st, earl, of, middlesex, who, opposed, war, on, grounds, of, cost, and, quickly, fell, in, much, the, same, manner, bacon, had, james, told, buckingham, he, was, a, fool, and, presciently, warned, charles, that, he, would, live, to, regret, the, revival, of, impeachment, as, a, parliamentary, tool, an, underfunded, makeshift, army, under, ernst, von, mansfeld, set, off, to, recover, the, palatinate, but, it, was, so, poorly, provisioned, that, it, never, advanced, beyond, the, dutch, coast, by, 1624, the, increasingly, ill, james, was, finding, it, difficult, to, control, parliament, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, march, 1625, charles, and, buckingham, had, already, assumed, de, facto, control, of, the, kingdom, with, the, failure, of, the, spanish, match, charles, and, buckingham, turned, their, attention, to, france, on, 1, may, 1625, charles, was, married, by, proxy, to, the, 15, year, old, french, princess, henrietta, maria, in, front, of, the, doors, of, notre, dame, de, paris, he, had, seen, her, in, paris, while, en, route, to, spain, they, met, in, person, on, 13, june, 1625, in, canterbury, charles, delayed, the, opening, of, his, first, parliament, until, after, the, marriage, was, consummated, to, forestall, any, opposition, many, members, of, the, commons, opposed, his, marriage, to, a, catholic, fearing, that, he, would, lift, restrictions, on, catholic, recusants, and, undermine, the, official, establishment, of, the, reformed, church, of, england, charles, told, parliament, that, he, would, not, relax, religious, restrictions, but, promised, to, do, exactly, that, in, a, secret, marriage, treaty, with, his, brother, in, law, louis, xiii, of, france, moreover, the, treaty, loaned, to, the, french, seven, english, naval, ships, that, were, used, to, suppress, the, protestant, huguenots, at, la, rochelle, in, september, 1625, charles, was, crowned, on, 2, february, 1626, at, westminster, abbey, but, without, his, wife, at, his, side, because, she, refused, to, participate, in, a, protestant, religious, ceremony, distrust, of, charles, s, religious, policies, increased, with, his, support, of, a, controversial, anti, calvinist, ecclesiastic, richard, montagu, who, was, in, disrepute, among, the, puritans, in, his, pamphlet, a, new, gag, for, an, old, goose, 1624, a, reply, to, the, catholic, pamphlet, a, new, gag, for, the, new, gospel, montagu, argued, against, calvinist, predestination, the, doctrine, that, god, preordained, salvation, and, damnation, anti, calvinists, known, as, arminians, believed, that, people, could, accept, or, reject, salvation, by, exercising, free, will, arminian, divines, had, been, one, of, the, few, sources, of, support, for, charles, s, proposed, spanish, marriage, with, king, james, s, support, montagu, produced, another, pamphlet, appello, caesarem, published, in, 1625, shortly, after, james, s, death, and, charles, s, accession, to, protect, montagu, from, the, stricture, of, puritan, members, of, parliament, charles, made, him, a, royal, chaplain, heightening, many, puritans, suspicions, that, charles, favoured, arminianism, as, a, clandestine, attempt, to, aid, catholicism, s, resurgence, rather, than, direct, involvement, in, the, european, land, war, the, english, parliament, preferred, a, relatively, inexpensive, naval, attack, on, spanish, colonies, in, the, new, world, hoping, for, the, capture, of, the, spanish, treasure, fleets, parliament, voted, to, grant, a, subsidy, of, 140, 000, an, insufficient, sum, for, charles, s, war, plans, moreover, the, house, of, commons, limited, its, authorisation, for, royal, collection, of, tonnage, and, poundage, two, varieties, of, customs, duties, to, a, year, although, previous, sovereigns, since, henry, vi, had, been, granted, the, right, for, life, in, this, manner, parliament, could, delay, approval, of, the, rates, until, after, a, full, scale, review, of, customs, revenue, the, bill, made, no, progress, in, the, house, of, lords, past, its, first, reading, although, no, act, of, parliament, for, the, levy, of, tonnage, and, poundage, was, obtained, charles, continued, to, collect, the, duties, a, poorly, conceived, and, executed, naval, expedition, against, spain, under, buckingham, s, leadership, went, badly, and, the, house, of, commons, began, proceedings, for, the, impeachment, of, the, duke, in, may, 1626, charles, nominated, buckingham, as, chancellor, of, cambridge, university, in, a, show, of, support, and, had, two, members, who, had, spoken, against, buckingham, dudley, digges, and, sir, john, eliot, arrested, at, the, door, of, the, house, the, commons, was, outraged, by, the, imprisonment, of, two, of, their, members, and, after, about, a, week, in, custody, both, were, released, on, 12, june, 1626, the, commons, launched, a, direct, protestation, attacking, buckingham, stating, we, protest, before, your, majesty, and, the, whole, world, that, until, this, great, person, be, removed, from, intermeddling, with, the, great, affairs, of, state, we, are, out, of, hope, of, any, good, success, and, do, fear, that, any, money, we, shall, or, can, give, will, through, his, misemployment, be, turned, rather, to, the, hurt, and, prejudice, of, this, your, kingdom, than, otherwise, as, by, lamentable, experience, we, have, found, those, large, supplies, formerly, and, lately, given, despite, the, protests, charles, refused, to, dismiss, his, friend, dismissing, parliament, instead, meanwhile, domestic, quarrels, between, charles, and, henrietta, maria, were, souring, the, early, years, of, their, marriage, disputes, over, her, jointure, appointments, to, her, household, and, the, practice, of, her, religion, culminated, in, the, king, expelling, the, vast, majority, of, her, french, attendants, in, august, 1626, despite, charles, s, agreement, to, provide, the, french, with, english, ships, as, a, condition, of, marrying, henrietta, maria, in, 1627, he, launched, an, attack, on, the, french, coast, to, defend, the, huguenots, at, la, rochelle, the, action, led, by, buckingham, was, ultimately, unsuccessful, buckingham, s, failure, to, protect, the, huguenots, and, his, retreat, from, saint, martin, de, r, spurred, louis, xiii, s, siege, of, la, rochelle, and, furthered, the, english, parliament, s, and, people, s, detestation, of, the, duke, charles, provoked, further, unrest, by, trying, to, raise, money, for, the, war, through, a, forced, loan, a, tax, levied, without, parliamentary, consent, in, november, 1627, the, test, case, in, the, king, s, bench, the, five, knights, case, found, that, the, king, had, a, prerogative, right, to, imprison, without, trial, those, who, refused, to, pay, the, forced, loan, summoned, again, in, march, 1628, parliament, adopted, a, petition, of, right, on, 26, may, calling, upon, charles, to, acknowledge, that, he, could, not, levy, taxes, without, parliament, s, consent, impose, martial, law, on, civilians, imprison, them, without, due, process, or, quarter, troops, in, their, homes, charles, assented, to, the, petition, on, 7, june, but, by, the, end, of, the, month, he, had, prorogued, parliament, and, reasserted, his, right, to, collect, customs, duties, without, authorisation, from, parliament, on, 23, august, 1628, buckingham, was, assassinated, charles, was, deeply, distressed, according, to, edward, hyde, 1st, earl, of, clarendon, he, threw, himself, upon, his, bed, lamenting, with, much, passion, and, with, abundance, of, tears, he, remained, grieving, in, his, room, for, two, days, in, contrast, the, public, rejoiced, at, buckingham, s, death, accentuating, the, gulf, between, the, court, and, the, nation, and, between, the, crown, and, the, commons, buckingham, s, death, effectively, ended, the, war, with, spain, and, eliminated, his, leadership, as, an, issue, but, it, did, not, end, the, conflicts, between, charles, and, parliament, it, did, however, coincide, with, an, improvement, in, charles, s, relationship, with, his, wife, and, by, november, 1628, their, old, quarrels, were, at, an, end, perhaps, charles, s, emotional, ties, were, transferred, from, buckingham, to, henrietta, maria, she, became, pregnant, for, the, first, time, and, the, bond, between, them, grew, stronger, together, they, embodied, an, image, of, virtue, and, family, life, and, their, court, became, a, model, of, formality, and, morality, in, january, 1629, charles, opened, the, second, session, of, the, english, parliament, which, had, been, prorogued, in, june, 1628, with, a, moderate, speech, on, the, tonnage, and, poundage, issue, members, of, the, house, of, commons, began, to, voice, opposition, to, charles, s, policies, in, light, of, the, case, of, john, rolle, a, member, of, parliament, whose, goods, had, been, confiscated, for, failing, to, pay, tonnage, and, poundage, many, mps, viewed, the, imposition, of, the, tax, as, a, breach, of, the, petition, of, right, when, charles, ordered, a, parliamentary, adjournment, on, 2, march, members, held, the, speaker, sir, john, finch, down, in, his, chair, so, that, the, session, could, be, prolonged, long, enough, for, resolutions, against, catholicism, arminianism, and, tonnage, and, poundage, to, be, read, out, and, acclaimed, by, the, chamber, the, provocation, was, too, much, for, charles, who, dissolved, parliament, and, had, nine, parliamentary, leaders, including, sir, john, eliot, imprisoned, over, the, matter, thereby, turning, the, men, into, martyrs, and, giving, popular, cause, to, their, protest, personal, rule, necessitated, peace, without, the, means, in, the, foreseeable, future, to, raise, funds, from, parliament, for, a, european, war, or, buckingham, s, help, charles, made, peace, with, france, and, spain, the, next, 11, years, during, which, charles, ruled, england, without, a, parliament, are, known, as, the, personal, rule, or, the, eleven, years, tyranny, ruling, without, parliament, was, not, exceptional, and, was, supported, by, precedent, but, only, parliament, could, legally, raise, taxes, and, without, it, charles, s, capacity, to, acquire, funds, for, his, treasury, was, limited, to, his, customary, rights, and, prerogatives, a, large, fiscal, deficit, had, arisen, during, the, reigns, of, elizabeth, i, and, james, i, notwithstanding, buckingham, s, short, lived, campaigns, against, both, spain, and, france, charles, had, little, financial, capacity, to, wage, wars, overseas, throughout, his, reign, he, was, obliged, to, rely, primarily, on, volunteer, forces, for, defence, and, on, diplomatic, efforts, to, support, his, sister, elizabeth, and, his, foreign, policy, objective, for, the, restoration, of, the, palatinate, england, was, still, the, least, taxed, country, in, europe, with, no, official, excise, and, no, regular, direct, taxation, to, raise, revenue, without, reconvening, parliament, charles, resurrected, an, all, but, forgotten, law, called, the, distraint, of, knighthood, in, abeyance, for, over, a, century, which, required, any, man, who, earned, 40, or, more, from, land, each, year, to, present, himself, at, the, king, s, coronation, to, be, knighted, relying, on, this, old, statute, charles, fined, those, who, had, failed, to, attend, his, coronation, in, 1626, the, chief, tax, charles, imposed, was, a, feudal, levy, known, as, ship, money, which, proved, even, more, unpopular, and, lucrative, than, tonnage, and, poundage, before, it, previously, collection, of, ship, money, had, been, authorised, only, during, wars, and, only, on, coastal, regions, but, charles, argued, that, there, was, no, legal, bar, to, collecting, the, tax, for, defence, during, peacetime, and, throughout, the, whole, of, the, kingdom, ship, money, paid, directly, to, the, treasury, of, the, navy, provided, between, 150, 000, to, 200, 000, annually, between, 1634, and, 1638, after, which, yields, declined, opposition, to, ship, money, steadily, grew, but, england, s, 12, common, law, judges, ruled, the, tax, within, the, king, s, prerogative, though, some, of, them, had, reservations, the, prosecution, of, john, hampden, for, non, payment, in, 1637, 38, provided, a, platform, for, popular, protest, and, the, judges, found, against, hampden, only, by, the, narrow, margin, of, 7, 5, charles, also, derived, money, by, granting, monopolies, despite, a, statute, forbidding, such, action, which, though, inefficient, raised, an, estimated, 100, 000, a, year, in, the, late, 1630s, one, such, monopoly, was, for, soap, pejoratively, referred, to, as, popish, soap, because, some, of, its, backers, were, catholics, charles, also, raised, funds, from, the, scottish, nobility, at, the, price, of, considerable, acrimony, by, the, act, of, revocation, 1625, whereby, all, gifts, of, royal, or, church, land, made, to, the, nobility, since, 1540, were, revoked, with, continued, ownership, being, subject, to, an, annual, rent, in, addition, the, boundaries, of, the, royal, forests, in, england, were, restored, to, their, ancient, limits, as, part, of, a, scheme, to, maximise, income, by, exploiting, the, land, and, fining, land, users, within, the, reasserted, boundaries, for, encroachment, the, programme, s, focus, was, disafforestation, and, sale, of, forest, lands, for, conversion, to, pasture, and, arable, farming, or, in, the, case, of, the, forest, of, dean, development, for, the, iron, industry, disafforestation, frequently, caused, riots, and, disturbances, including, those, known, as, the, western, rising, against, the, background, of, this, unrest, charles, faced, bankruptcy, in, mid, 1640, the, city, of, london, preoccupied, with, its, own, grievances, refused, to, make, any, loans, to, him, as, did, foreign, powers, in, this, extremity, in, july, charles, seized, silver, bullion, worth, 130, 000, held, in, trust, at, the, mint, in, the, tower, of, london, promising, its, later, return, at, 8, interest, to, its, owners, in, august, after, the, east, india, company, refused, to, grant, a, loan, lord, cottington, seized, the, company, s, stock, of, pepper, and, spices, and, sold, it, for, 60, 000, far, below, its, market, value, promising, to, refund, the, money, with, interest, later, throughout, charles, s, reign, the, english, reformation, was, in, the, forefront, of, political, debate, arminian, theology, emphasised, clerical, authority, and, the, individual, s, ability, to, reject, or, accept, salvation, which, opponents, viewed, as, heretical, and, a, potential, vehicle, for, the, reintroduction, of, catholicism, puritan, reformers, considered, charles, too, sympathetic, to, arminianism, and, opposed, his, desire, to, move, the, church, of, england, in, a, more, traditional, and, sacramental, direction, in, addition, his, protestant, subjects, followed, the, european, war, closely, and, grew, increasingly, dismayed, by, charles, s, diplomacy, with, spain, and, his, failure, to, support, the, protestant, cause, abroad, effectively, in, 1633, charles, appointed, william, laud, archbishop, of, canterbury, they, initiated, a, series, of, reforms, to, promote, religious, uniformity, by, restricting, non, conformist, preachers, insisting, the, liturgy, be, celebrated, as, prescribed, by, the, book, of, common, prayer, organising, the, internal, architecture, of, english, churches, to, emphasise, the, sacrament, of, the, altar, and, reissuing, king, james, s, declaration, of, sports, which, permitted, secular, activities, on, the, sabbath, the, feoffees, for, impropriations, an, organisation, that, bought, benefices, and, advowsons, so, that, puritans, could, be, appointed, to, them, was, dissolved, laud, prosecuted, those, who, opposed, his, reforms, in, the, court, of, high, commission, and, the, star, chamber, the, two, most, powerful, courts, in, the, land, the, courts, became, feared, for, their, censorship, of, opposing, religious, views, and, unpopular, among, the, propertied, classes, for, inflicting, degrading, punishments, on, gentlemen, for, example, in, 1637, william, prynne, henry, burton, and, john, bastwick, were, pilloried, whipped, and, mutilated, by, cropping, and, imprisoned, indefinitely, for, publishing, anti, episcopal, pamphlets, when, charles, attempted, to, impose, his, religious, policies, in, scotland, he, faced, numerous, difficulties, although, born, in, scotland, charles, had, become, estranged, from, it, his, first, visit, since, early, childhood, was, for, his, scottish, coronation, in, 1633, to, the, dismay, of, the, scots, who, had, removed, many, traditional, rituals, from, their, liturgical, practice, charles, insisted, that, the, coronation, be, conducted, using, the, anglican, rite, in, 1637, he, ordered, the, use, of, a, new, prayer, book, in, scotland, that, was, almost, identical, to, the, english, book, of, common, prayer, without, consulting, either, the, scottish, parliament, or, the, kirk, although, it, had, been, written, under, charles, s, direction, by, scottish, bishops, many, scots, resisted, it, seeing, it, as, a, vehicle, to, introduce, anglicanism, to, scotland, on, 23, july, riots, erupted, in, edinburgh, upon, the, first, sunday, of, the, prayer, book, s, usage, and, unrest, spread, throughout, the, kirk, the, public, began, to, mobilise, around, a, reaffirmation, of, the, national, covenant, whose, signatories, pledged, to, uphold, the, reformed, religion, of, scotland, and, reject, any, innovations, not, authorised, by, kirk, and, parliament, when, the, general, assembly, of, the, church, of, scotland, met, in, november, 1638, it, condemned, the, new, prayer, book, abolished, episcopal, church, government, by, bishops, and, adopted, presbyterian, government, by, elders, and, deacons, charles, perceived, the, unrest, in, scotland, as, a, rebellion, against, his, authority, precipitating, the, first, bishops, war, in, 1639, he, did, not, seek, subsidies, from, the, english, parliament, to, wage, war, instead, raising, an, army, without, parliamentary, aid, and, marching, to, berwick, upon, tweed, on, the, scottish, border, the, army, did, not, engage, the, covenanters, as, the, king, feared, the, defeat, of, his, forces, whom, he, believed, to, be, significantly, outnumbered, by, the, scots, in, the, treaty, of, berwick, charles, regained, custody, of, his, scottish, fortresses, and, secured, the, dissolution, of, the, covenanters, interim, government, albeit, at, the, decisive, concession, that, both, the, scottish, parliament, and, general, assembly, of, the, scottish, church, were, called, the, military, failure, in, the, first, bishops, war, caused, a, financial, and, diplomatic, crisis, for, charles, that, deepened, when, his, efforts, to, raise, funds, from, spain, while, simultaneously, continuing, his, support, for, his, palatine, relatives, led, to, the, public, humiliation, of, the, battle, of, the, downs, where, the, dutch, destroyed, a, spanish, bullion, fleet, off, the, coast, of, kent, in, sight, of, the, impotent, english, navy, charles, continued, peace, negotiations, with, the, scots, in, a, bid, to, gain, time, before, launching, a, new, military, campaign, because, of, his, financial, weakness, he, was, forced, to, call, parliament, into, session, in, an, attempt, to, raise, funds, for, such, a, venture, both, the, english, and, irish, parliaments, were, summoned, in, the, early, months, of, 1640, in, march, 1640, the, irish, parliament, duly, voted, in, a, subsidy, of, 180, 000, with, the, promise, to, raise, an, army, 9, 000, strong, by, the, end, of, may, but, in, the, english, general, election, in, march, court, candidates, fared, badly, and, charles, s, dealings, with, the, english, parliament, in, april, quickly, reached, stalemate, the, earls, of, northumberland, and, strafford, attempted, to, broker, a, compromise, whereby, the, king, would, agree, to, forfeit, ship, money, in, exchange, for, 650, 000, although, the, cost, of, the, coming, war, was, estimated, at, 1, million, nevertheless, this, alone, was, insufficient, to, produce, consensus, in, the, commons, the, parliamentarians, calls, for, further, reforms, were, ignored, by, charles, who, still, retained, the, support, of, the, house, of, lords, despite, the, protests, of, the, earl, of, northumberland, the, short, parliament, as, it, came, to, be, known, was, dissolved, in, may, 1640, less, than, a, month, after, it, assembled, by, this, stage, the, earl, of, strafford, lord, deputy, of, ireland, since, 1632, had, emerged, as, charles, s, right, hand, man, and, together, with, archbishop, laud, pursued, a, policy, that, he, termed, thorough, which, aimed, to, make, central, royal, authority, more, efficient, and, effective, at, the, expense, of, local, or, anti, government, interests, although, originally, a, critic, of, the, king, strafford, defected, to, royal, service, in, 1628, in, part, due, to, the, duke, of, buckingham, s, persuasion, and, had, since, emerged, alongside, laud, as, the, most, influential, of, charles, s, ministers, bolstered, by, the, failure, of, the, english, short, parliament, the, scottish, parliament, declared, itself, capable, of, governing, without, the, king, s, consent, and, in, august, 1640, the, covenanter, army, moved, into, the, english, county, of, northumberland, following, the, illness, of, lord, northumberland, who, was, the, king, s, commander, in, chief, charles, and, strafford, went, north, to, command, the, english, forces, despite, strafford, being, ill, himself, with, a, combination, of, gout, and, dysentery, the, scottish, soldiery, many, of, whom, were, veterans, of, the, thirty, years, war, had, far, greater, morale, and, training, than, their, english, counterparts, they, met, virtually, no, resistance, until, reaching, newcastle, upon, tyne, where, they, defeated, the, english, forces, at, the, battle, of, newburn, and, occupied, the, city, as, well, as, the, neighbouring, county, of, durham, as, demands, for, a, parliament, grew, charles, took, the, unusual, step, of, summoning, a, great, council, of, peers, by, the, time, it, met, on, 24, september, at, york, charles, had, resolved, to, follow, the, almost, universal, advice, to, call, a, parliament, after, informing, the, peers, that, a, parliament, would, convene, in, november, he, asked, them, to, consider, how, he, could, acquire, funds, to, maintain, his, army, against, the, scots, in, the, meantime, they, recommended, making, peace, a, cessation, of, arms, was, negotiated, in, the, humiliating, treaty, of, ripon, signed, in, october, 1640, this, stated, that, the, scots, would, continue, to, occupy, northumberland, and, durham, and, be, paid, 850, per, day, indefinitely, until, a, final, settlement, was, negotiated, and, the, english, parliament, recalled, which, would, be, required, to, raise, sufficient, funds, to, pay, the, scottish, forces, consequently, charles, summoned, what, later, became, known, as, the, long, parliament, once, again, his, supporters, fared, badly, at, the, polls, of, the, 493, members, of, the, commons, returned, in, november, over, 350, were, opposed, to, the, king, the, long, parliament, proved, just, as, difficult, for, charles, as, had, the, short, parliament, it, assembled, on, 3, november, 1640, and, quickly, began, proceedings, to, impeach, the, king, s, leading, counsellors, for, high, treason, strafford, was, taken, into, custody, on, 10, november, laud, was, impeached, on, 18, december, finch, now, lord, keeper, of, the, great, seal, was, impeached, the, next, day, and, consequently, fled, to, the, hague, with, charles, s, permission, on, 21, december, to, prevent, the, king, from, dissolving, it, at, will, parliament, passed, the, triennial, act, which, required, parliament, to, be, summoned, at, least, every, three, years, and, permitted, the, lord, keeper, and, 12, peers, to, summon, parliament, if, the, king, failed, to, do, so, the, act, was, coupled, with, a, subsidy, bill, and, to, secure, the, latter, charles, grudgingly, granted, royal, assent, in, february, 1641, strafford, had, become, the, principal, target, of, the, parliamentarians, particularly, john, pym, and, he, went, on, trial, for, high, treason, on, 22, march, 1641, but, the, key, allegation, by, sir, henry, vane, that, strafford, had, threatened, to, use, the, irish, army, to, subdue, england, was, not, corroborated, and, on, 10, april, pym, s, case, collapsed, pym, and, his, allies, immediately, launched, a, bill, of, attainder, which, simply, declared, strafford, guilty, and, pronounced, the, sentence, of, death, charles, assured, strafford, that, upon, the, word, of, a, king, you, shall, not, suffer, in, life, honour, or, fortune, and, the, attainder, could, not, succeed, if, charles, withheld, assent, furthermore, many, members, and, most, peers, opposed, the, attainder, not, wishing, in, the, words, of, one, to, commit, murder, with, the, sword, of, justice, but, increased, tensions, and, an, attempted, coup, by, royalist, army, officers, in, support, of, strafford, and, in, which, charles, was, involved, began, to, sway, the, issue, the, commons, passed, the, bill, on, 20, april, by, a, large, margin, 204, in, favour, 59, opposed, and, 230, abstained, and, the, lords, acquiesced, by, 26, votes, to, 19, with, 79, absent, in, may, on, 3, may, parliament, s, protestation, attacked, the, wicked, counsels, of, charles, s, arbitrary, and, tyrannical, government, while, those, who, signed, the, petition, undertook, to, defend, the, king, s, person, honour, and, estate, they, also, swore, to, preserve, the, true, reformed, religion, parliament, and, the, rights, and, liberties, of, the, subjects, fearing, for, his, family, s, safety, in, the, face, of, unrest, charles, reluctantly, assented, to, strafford, s, attainder, on, 9, may, after, consulting, his, judges, and, bishops, strafford, was, beheaded, three, days, later, also, in, early, may, charles, assented, to, an, unprecedented, act, that, forbade, the, dissolution, of, the, english, parliament, without, its, consent, in, the, following, months, ship, money, fines, in, distraint, of, knighthood, and, excise, without, parliamentary, consent, were, declared, unlawful, and, the, courts, of, star, chamber, and, high, commission, were, abolished, all, remaining, forms, of, taxation, were, legalised, and, regulated, by, the, tonnage, and, poundage, act, the, house, of, commons, also, launched, bills, attacking, bishops, and, episcopacy, but, these, failed, in, the, lords, charles, had, made, important, concessions, in, england, and, temporarily, improved, his, position, in, scotland, by, signing, a, final, settlement, of, the, bishops, wars, then, securing, the, scots, favour, on, a, visit, from, august, to, november, 1641, during, which, he, conceded, to, the, official, establishment, of, presbyterianism, in, scotland, but, after, an, attempted, royalist, coup, in, scotland, known, as, the, incident, charles, s, credibility, was, significantly, undermined, ireland, s, population, was, split, into, three, main, sociopolitical, groups, the, gaelic, irish, who, were, catholic, the, old, english, who, were, descended, from, medieval, normans, and, also, predominantly, catholic, and, the, new, english, who, were, protestant, settlers, from, england, and, scotland, aligned, with, the, english, parliament, and, the, covenanters, strafford, s, administration, had, improved, the, irish, economy, and, boosted, tax, revenue, but, had, done, so, by, heavy, handedly, imposing, order, he, had, trained, up, a, large, catholic, army, in, support, of, the, king, and, weakened, the, irish, parliament, s, authority, while, continuing, to, confiscate, land, from, catholics, for, protestant, settlement, at, the, same, time, as, promoting, a, laudian, anglicanism, that, was, anathema, to, presbyterians, as, a, result, all, three, groups, had, become, disaffected, strafford, s, impeachment, provided, a, new, departure, for, irish, politics, whereby, all, sides, joined, to, present, evidence, against, him, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, english, parliament, the, old, english, members, of, the, irish, parliament, argued, that, while, opposed, to, strafford, they, remained, loyal, to, charles, they, argued, that, the, king, had, been, led, astray, by, malign, counsellors, and, that, moreover, a, viceroy, such, as, strafford, could, emerge, as, a, despotic, figure, instead, of, ensuring, that, the, king, was, directly, involved, in, governance, strafford, s, fall, from, power, weakened, charles, s, influence, in, ireland, the, dissolution, of, the, irish, army, was, unsuccessfully, demanded, three, times, by, the, english, commons, during, strafford, s, imprisonment, until, lack, of, money, eventually, forced, charles, to, disband, the, army, at, the, end, of, strafford, s, trial, disputes, over, the, transfer, of, land, ownership, from, native, catholic, to, settler, protestant, particularly, in, relation, to, the, plantation, of, ulster, coupled, with, resentment, at, moves, to, ensure, the, irish, parliament, was, subordinate, to, the, parliament, of, england, sowed, the, seeds, of, rebellion, when, armed, conflict, arose, between, the, gaelic, irish, and, new, english, in, late, october, 1641, the, old, english, sided, with, the, gaelic, irish, while, simultaneously, professing, their, loyalty, to, the, king, in, november, 1641, the, house, of, commons, passed, the, grand, remonstrance, a, long, list, of, grievances, against, actions, by, charles, s, ministers, committed, since, the, beginning, of, his, reign, that, were, asserted, to, be, part, of, a, grand, catholic, conspiracy, of, which, the, king, was, an, unwitting, member, but, it, was, in, many, ways, a, step, too, far, by, pym, and, passed, by, only, 11, votes, 159, to, 148, furthermore, the, remonstrance, had, very, little, support, in, the, house, of, lords, which, the, remonstrance, attacked, the, tension, was, heightened, by, news, of, the, irish, rebellion, coupled, with, inaccurate, rumours, of, charles, s, complicity, throughout, november, a, series, of, alarmist, pamphlets, published, stories, of, atrocities, in, ireland, including, massacres, of, new, english, settlers, by, the, native, irish, who, could, not, be, controlled, by, the, old, english, lords, rumours, of, papist, conspiracies, circulated, in, england, and, english, anti, catholic, opinion, was, strengthened, damaging, charles, s, reputation, and, authority, the, english, parliament, distrusted, charles, s, motivations, when, he, called, for, funds, to, put, down, the, irish, rebellion, many, members, of, the, commons, suspected, that, forces, he, raised, might, later, be, used, against, parliament, itself, pym, s, militia, bill, was, intended, to, wrest, control, of, the, army, from, the, king, but, it, did, not, have, the, support, of, the, lords, let, alone, charles, instead, the, commons, passed, the, bill, as, an, ordinance, which, they, claimed, did, not, require, royal, assent, the, militia, ordinance, appears, to, have, prompted, more, members, of, the, lords, to, support, the, king, in, an, attempt, to, strengthen, his, position, charles, generated, great, antipathy, in, london, which, was, already, fast, falling, into, lawlessness, when, he, placed, the, tower, of, london, under, the, command, of, colonel, thomas, lunsford, an, infamous, albeit, efficient, career, officer, when, rumours, reached, charles, that, parliament, intended, to, impeach, his, wife, for, supposedly, conspiring, with, the, irish, rebels, he, decided, to, take, drastic, action, charles, suspected, probably, correctly, that, some, members, of, the, english, parliament, had, colluded, with, the, invading, scots, on, 3, january, 1642, charles, directed, parliament, to, give, up, five, specific, members, of, the, commons, pym, john, hampden, denzil, holles, william, strode, and, sir, arthur, haselrig, and, one, peer, lord, mandeville, on, the, grounds, of, high, treason, when, parliament, refused, it, was, possibly, henrietta, maria, who, persuaded, charles, to, arrest, the, five, members, by, force, which, he, resolved, to, do, personally, but, news, of, the, warrant, reached, parliament, ahead, of, him, and, the, wanted, men, slipped, away, by, boat, shortly, before, charles, entered, the, house, of, commons, with, an, armed, guard, on, 4, january, having, displaced, speaker, william, lenthall, from, his, chair, the, king, asked, him, where, the, mps, had, fled, lenthall, on, his, knees, famously, replied, may, it, please, your, majesty, i, have, neither, eyes, to, see, nor, tongue, to, speak, in, this, place, but, as, the, house, is, pleased, to, direct, me, whose, servant, i, am, here, charles, abjectly, declared, all, my, birds, have, flown, and, was, forced, to, retire, empty, handed, the, botched, arrest, attempt, was, politically, disastrous, for, charles, no, english, sovereign, had, ever, entered, the, house, of, commons, and, his, unprecedented, invasion, of, the, chamber, to, arrest, its, members, was, considered, a, grave, breach, of, parliamentary, privilege, in, one, stroke, charles, destroyed, his, supporters, efforts, to, portray, him, as, a, defence, against, innovation, and, disorder, parliament, quickly, seized, london, and, charles, fled, the, capital, for, hampton, court, palace, on, 10, january, moving, two, days, later, to, windsor, castle, after, sending, his, wife, and, eldest, daughter, to, safety, abroad, in, february, he, travelled, northwards, hoping, to, seize, the, military, arsenal, at, hull, to, his, dismay, he, was, rebuffed, by, the, town, s, parliamentary, governor, sir, john, hotham, who, refused, him, entry, in, april, and, charles, was, forced, to, withdraw, in, mid, 1642, both, sides, began, to, arm, charles, raised, an, army, using, the, medieval, method, of, commission, of, array, and, parliament, called, for, volunteers, for, its, militia, the, negotiations, proved, futile, and, charles, raised, the, royal, standard, in, nottingham, on, 22, august, 1642, by, then, his, forces, controlled, roughly, the, midlands, wales, the, west, country, and, northern, england, he, set, up, his, court, at, oxford, parliament, controlled, london, the, south, east, and, east, anglia, as, well, as, the, english, navy, after, a, few, skirmishes, the, opposing, forces, met, in, earnest, at, edgehill, on, 23, october, 1642, charles, s, nephew, prince, rupert, of, the, rhine, disagreed, with, the, battle, strategy, of, the, royalist, commander, lord, lindsey, and, charles, sided, with, rupert, lindsey, resigned, leaving, charles, to, assume, overall, command, assisted, by, lord, forth, rupert, s, cavalry, successfully, charged, through, the, parliamentary, ranks, but, instead, of, swiftly, returning, to, the, field, rode, off, to, plunder, the, parliamentary, baggage, train, lindsey, acting, as, a, colonel, was, wounded, and, bled, to, death, without, medical, attention, the, battle, ended, inconclusively, as, the, daylight, faded, in, his, own, words, the, experience, of, battle, had, left, charles, exceedingly, and, deeply, grieved, he, regrouped, at, oxford, turning, down, rupert, s, suggestion, of, an, immediate, attack, on, london, after, a, week, he, set, out, for, the, capital, on, 3, november, capturing, brentford, on, the, way, while, simultaneously, continuing, to, negotiate, with, civic, and, parliamentary, delegations, at, turnham, green, on, the, outskirts, of, london, the, royalist, army, met, resistance, from, the, city, militia, and, faced, with, a, numerically, superior, force, charles, ordered, a, retreat, he, overwintered, in, oxford, strengthening, the, city, s, defences, and, preparing, for, the, next, season, s, campaign, peace, talks, between, the, two, sides, collapsed, in, april, the, war, continued, indecisively, over, the, next, couple, of, years, and, henrietta, maria, returned, to, britain, for, 17, months, from, february, 1643, after, rupert, captured, bristol, in, july, 1643, charles, visited, the, port, city, and, laid, siege, to, gloucester, further, up, the, river, severn, his, plan, to, undermine, the, city, walls, failed, due, to, heavy, rain, and, on, the, approach, of, a, parliamentary, relief, force, charles, lifted, the, siege, and, withdrew, to, sudeley, castle, the, parliamentary, army, turned, back, towards, london, and, charles, set, off, in, pursuit, the, two, armies, met, at, newbury, berkshire, on, 20, september, just, as, at, edgehill, the, battle, stalemated, at, nightfall, and, the, armies, disengaged, in, january, 1644, charles, summoned, a, parliament, at, oxford, which, was, attended, by, about, 40, peers, and, 118, members, of, the, commons, all, told, the, oxford, parliament, which, sat, until, march, 1645, was, supported, by, the, majority, of, peers, and, about, a, third, of, the, commons, charles, became, disillusioned, by, the, assembly, s, ineffectiveness, calling, it, a, mongrel, in, private, letters, to, his, wife, in, 1644, charles, remained, in, the, southern, half, of, england, while, rupert, rode, north, to, relieve, newark, and, york, which, were, under, threat, from, parliamentary, and, scottish, covenanter, armies, charles, was, victorious, at, the, battle, of, cropredy, bridge, in, late, june, but, the, royalists, in, the, north, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, marston, moor, just, a, few, days, later, the, king, continued, his, campaign, in, the, south, encircling, and, disarming, the, parliamentary, army, of, the, earl, of, essex, returning, northwards, to, his, base, at, oxford, he, fought, at, newbury, for, a, second, time, before, the, winter, closed, in, the, battle, ended, indecisively, attempts, to, negotiate, a, settlement, over, the, winter, while, both, sides, rearmed, and, reorganised, were, again, unsuccessful, at, the, battle, of, naseby, on, 14, june, 1645, rupert, s, horsemen, again, mounted, a, successful, charge, against, the, flank, of, parliament, s, new, model, army, but, elsewhere, on, the, field, opposing, forces, pushed, charles, s, troops, back, attempting, to, rally, his, men, charles, rode, forward, but, as, he, did, so, lord, carnwath, seized, his, bridle, and, pulled, him, back, fearing, for, the, king, s, safety, the, royalist, soldiers, misinterpreted, carnwath, s, action, as, a, signal, to, move, back, leading, to, a, collapse, of, their, position, the, military, balance, tipped, decisively, in, favour, of, parliament, there, followed, a, series, of, defeats, for, the, royalists, and, then, the, siege, of, oxford, from, which, charles, escaped, disguised, as, a, servant, in, april, 1646, he, put, himself, into, the, hands, of, the, scottish, presbyterian, army, besieging, newark, and, was, taken, northwards, to, newcastle, upon, tyne, after, nine, months, of, negotiations, the, scots, finally, arrived, at, an, agreement, with, the, english, parliament, in, exchange, for, 100, 000, and, the, promise, of, more, money, in, the, future, the, scots, withdrew, from, newcastle, and, delivered, charles, to, the, parliamentary, commissioners, in, january, 1647, parliament, held, charles, under, house, arrest, at, holdenby, house, in, northamptonshire, until, cornet, george, joyce, took, him, by, threat, of, force, from, holdenby, on, 3, june, in, the, name, of, the, new, model, army, by, this, time, mutual, suspicion, had, developed, between, parliament, which, favoured, army, disbandment, and, presbyterianism, and, the, new, model, army, which, was, primarily, officered, by, congregationalist, independents, who, sought, a, greater, political, role, charles, was, eager, to, exploit, the, widening, divisions, and, apparently, viewed, joyce, s, actions, as, an, opportunity, rather, than, a, threat, he, was, taken, first, to, newmarket, at, his, own, suggestion, and, then, transferred, to, oatlands, and, subsequently, hampton, court, while, more, fruitless, negotiations, took, place, by, november, he, determined, that, it, would, be, in, his, best, interests, to, escape, perhaps, to, france, southern, england, or, berwick, upon, tweed, near,

isle, of, wight, whom, he, apparently, believed, to, be, sympathetic, but, hammond, confined, charles, in, carisbrooke, castle, and, informed, parliament, that, charles, was, in, his, custody, from, carisbrooke, charles, continued, to, try, to, bargain, with, the, various, parties, in, direct, contrast, to, his, previous, conflict, with, the, scottish, kirk, on, 26, december, 1647, he, signed, a, secret, treaty, with, the, scots, under, the, agreement, called, the, engagement, the, scots, undertook, to, invade, england, on, charles, s, behalf, and, restore, him, to, the, throne, on, condition, that, presbyterianism, be, established, in, england, for, three, years, the, royalists, rose, in, may, 1648, igniting, the, second, civil, war, and, as, agreed, with, charles, the, scots, invaded, england, uprisings, in, kent, essex, and, cumberland, and, a, rebellion, in, south, wales, were, put, down, by, the, new, model, army, and, with, the, defeat, of, the, scots, at, the, battle, of, preston, in, august, 1648, the, royalists, lost, any, chance, of, winning, the, war, charles, s, only, recourse, was, to, return, to, negotiations, which, were, held, at, newport, on, the, isle, of, wight, on, 5, december, 1648, parliament, voted, 129, to, 83, to, continue, negotiating, with, the, king, but, oliver, cromwell, and, the, army, opposed, any, further, talks, with, someone, they, viewed, as, a, bloody, tyrant, and, were, already, taking, action, to, consolidate, their, power, hammond, was, replaced, as, governor, of, the, isle, of, wight, on, 27, november, and, placed, in, the, custody, of, the, army, the, following, day, in, pride, s, purge, on, 6, and, 7, december, the, members, of, parliament, out, of, sympathy, with, the, military, were, arrested, or, excluded, by, colonel, thomas, pride, while, others, stayed, away, voluntarily, the, remaining, members, formed, the, rump, parliament, it, was, effectively, a, military, coup, charles, was, moved, to, hurst, castle, at, the, end, of, 1648, and, thereafter, to, windsor, castle, in, january, 1649, the, rump, parliament, house, of, commons, indicted, him, for, treason, however, the, house, of, lords, rejected, the, charge, the, idea, of, trying, a, king, was, novel, the, chief, justices, of, the, three, common, law, courts, of, england, henry, rolle, oliver, st, john, and, john, wilde, all, opposed, the, indictment, as, unlawful, the, rump, commons, declared, itself, capable, of, legislating, alone, passed, a, bill, creating, a, separate, court, for, charles, s, trial, and, declared, the, bill, an, act, without, the, need, for, royal, assent, the, high, court, of, justice, established, by, the, act, consisted, of, 135, commissioners, but, many, either, refused, to, serve, or, chose, to, stay, away, only, 68, all, firm, parliamentarians, attended, charles, s, trial, on, charges, of, high, treason, and, other, high, crimes, that, began, on, 20, january, 1649, in, westminster, hall, john, bradshaw, acted, as, president, of, the, court, and, the, prosecution, was, led, by, solicitor, general, john, cook, charles, was, accused, of, treason, against, england, by, using, his, power, to, pursue, his, personal, interest, rather, than, the, good, of, the, country, the, charge, stated, that, he, was, devising, a, wicked, design, to, erect, and, uphold, in, himself, an, unlimited, and, tyrannical, power, to, rule, according, to, his, will, and, to, overthrow, the, rights, and, liberties, of, the, people, in, carrying, this, out, he, had, traitorously, and, maliciously, levied, war, against, the, present, parliament, and, the, people, therein, represented, and, that, the, wicked, designs, wars, and, evil, practices, of, him, the, said, charles, stuart, have, been, and, are, carried, on, for, the, advancement, and, upholding, of, a, personal, interest, of, will, power, and, pretended, prerogative, to, himself, and, his, family, against, the, public, interest, common, right, liberty, justice, and, peace, of, the, people, of, this, nation, presaging, the, modern, concept, of, command, responsibility, the, indictment, held, him, guilty, of, all, the, treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages, and, mischiefs, to, this, nation, acted, and, committed, in, the, said, wars, or, occasioned, thereby, an, estimated, 300, 000, people, or, 6, of, the, population, died, during, the, war, over, the, first, three, days, of, the, trial, whenever, charles, was, asked, to, plead, he, refused, stating, his, objection, with, the, words, i, would, know, by, what, power, i, am, called, hither, by, what, lawful, authority, he, claimed, that, no, court, had, jurisdiction, over, a, monarch, that, his, own, authority, to, rule, had, been, given, to, him, by, god, and, by, the, traditional, laws, of, england, and, that, the, power, wielded, by, those, trying, him, was, only, that, of, force, of, arms, charles, insisted, that, the, trial, was, illegal, explaining, that, no, earthly, power, can, justly, call, me, who, am, your, king, in, question, as, a, delinquent, this, day, s, proceeding, cannot, be, warranted, by, god, s, laws, for, on, the, contrary, the, authority, of, obedience, unto, kings, is, clearly, warranted, and, strictly, commanded, in, both, the, old, and, new, testament, for, the, law, of, this, land, i, am, no, less, confident, that, no, learned, lawyer, will, affirm, that, an, impeachment, can, lie, against, the, king, they, all, going, in, his, name, and, one, of, their, maxims, is, that, the, king, can, do, no, wrong, the, higher, house, is, totally, excluded, and, for, the, house, of, commons, it, is, too, well, known, that, the, major, part, of, them, are, detained, or, deterred, from, sitting, the, arms, i, took, up, were, only, to, defend, the, fundamental, laws, of, this, kingdom, against, those, who, have, supposed, my, power, hath, totally, changed, the, ancient, government, the, court, by, contrast, challenged, the, doctrine, of, sovereign, immunity, and, proposed, that, the, king, of, england, was, not, a, person, but, an, office, whose, every, occupant, was, entrusted, with, a, limited, power, to, govern, by, and, according, to, the, laws, of, the, land, and, not, otherwise, at, the, end, of, the, third, day, charles, was, removed, from, the, court, which, then, heard, over, 30, witnesses, against, him, in, his, absence, over, the, next, two, days, and, on, 26, january, condemned, him, to, death, the, next, day, the, king, was, brought, before, a, public, session, of, the, commission, declared, guilty, and, sentenced, the, judgement, read, for, all, which, treasons, and, crimes, this, court, doth, adjudge, that, he, the, said, charles, stuart, as, a, tyrant, traitor, murderer, and, public, enemy, to, the, good, people, of, this, nation, shall, be, put, to, death, by, the, severing, of, his, head, from, his, body, fifty, nine, of, the, commissioners, signed, charles, s, death, warrant, charles, s, execution, was, scheduled, for, tuesday, 30, january, 1649, two, of, his, children, remained, in, england, under, the, control, of, the, parliamentarians, elizabeth, and, henry, they, were, permitted, to, visit, him, on, 29, january, and, he, bade, them, a, tearful, farewell, the, next, morning, he, called, for, two, shirts, to, prevent, the, cold, weather, causing, any, noticeable, shivers, that, the, crowd, could, have, mistaken, for, fear, the, season, is, so, sharp, as, probably, may, make, me, shake, which, some, observers, may, imagine, proceeds, from, fear, i, would, have, no, such, imputation, he, walked, under, guard, from, st, james, s, palace, where, he, had, been, confined, to, the, palace, of, whitehall, where, an, execution, scaffold, had, been, erected, in, front, of, the, banqueting, house, charles, was, separated, from, spectators, by, large, ranks, of, soldiers, and, his, last, speech, reached, only, those, with, him, on, the, scaffold, he, blamed, his, fate, on, his, failure, to, prevent, the, execution, of, his, loyal, servant, strafford, an, unjust, sentence, that, i, suffered, to, take, effect, is, punished, now, by, an, unjust, sentence, on, me, he, declared, that, he, had, desired, the, liberty, and, freedom, of, the, people, as, much, as, any, but, i, must, tell, you, that, their, liberty, and, freedom, consists, in, having, government, it, is, not, their, having, a, share, in, the, government, that, is, nothing, appertaining, unto, them, a, subject, and, a, sovereign, are, clean, different, things, he, continued, i, shall, go, from, a, corruptible, to, an, incorruptible, crown, where, no, disturbance, can, be, at, about, 2, 00, p, m, charles, put, his, head, on, the, block, after, saying, a, prayer, and, signalled, the, executioner, when, he, was, ready, by, stretching, out, his, hands, he, was, then, beheaded, in, one, clean, stroke, according, to, observer, philip, henry, a, moan, as, i, never, heard, before, and, desire, i, may, never, hear, again, rose, from, the, assembled, crowd, some, of, whom, then, dipped, their, handkerchiefs, in, the, king, s, blood, as, a, memento, the, executioner, was, masked, and, disguised, and, there, is, debate, over, his, identity, the, commissioners, approached, richard, brandon, the, common, hangman, of, london, but, he, refused, at, least, at, first, despite, being, offered, 200, a, considerably, large, sum, for, the, time, it, is, possible, he, relented, and, undertook, the, commission, after, being, threatened, with, death, but, others, have, been, named, as, potential, candidates, including, george, joyce, william, hulet, and, hugh, peters, the, clean, strike, confirmed, by, an, examination, of, the, king, s, body, at, windsor, in, 1813, suggests, that, the, execution, was, carried, out, by, an, experienced, headsman, it, was, common, practice, for, the, severed, head, of, a, traitor, to, be, held, up, and, exhibited, to, the, crowd, with, the, words, behold, the, head, of, a, traitor, charles, s, head, was, exhibited, but, those, words, were, not, used, possibly, because, the, executioner, did, not, want, his, voice, recognised, on, the, day, after, the, execution, the, king, s, head, was, sewn, back, onto, his, body, which, was, then, embalmed, and, placed, in, a, lead, coffin, the, commission, refused, to, allow, charles, s, burial, at, westminster, abbey, so, his, body, was, conveyed, to, windsor, on, the, night, of, 7, february, he, was, buried, in, private, on, 9, february, 1649, in, the, henry, viii, vault, in, the, chapel, s, quire, alongside, the, coffins, of, henry, viii, and, henry, s, third, wife, jane, seymour, in, st, george, s, chapel, windsor, castle, the, king, s, son, charles, ii, later, planned, for, an, elaborate, royal, mausoleum, to, be, erected, in, hyde, park, london, but, it, was, never, built, ten, days, after, charles, s, execution, on, the, day, of, his, interment, a, memoir, purportedly, written, by, him, appeared, for, sale, this, book, the, eikon, basilike, greek, for, the, royal, portrait, contained, an, apologia, for, royal, policies, and, proved, an, effective, piece, of, royalist, propaganda, john, milton, wrote, a, parliamentary, rejoinder, the, eikonoklastes, the, iconoclast, but, the, response, made, little, headway, against, the, pathos, of, the, royalist, book, anglicans, and, royalists, fashioned, an, image, of, martyrdom, and, in, the, convocations, of, canterbury, and, york, of, 1660, king, charles, the, martyr, was, added, to, the, church, of, england, s, liturgical, calendar, high, church, anglicans, held, special, services, on, the, anniversary, of, his, death, churches, such, as, those, at, falmouth, and, tunbridge, wells, and, anglican, devotional, societies, such, as, the, society, of, king, charles, the, martyr, were, founded, in, his, honour, with, the, monarchy, overthrown, england, became, a, republic, or, commonwealth, the, house, of, lords, was, abolished, by, the, rump, commons, and, executive, power, was, assumed, by, a, council, of, state, all, significant, military, opposition, in, britain, and, ireland, was, extinguished, by, the, forces, of, oliver, cromwell, in, the, anglo, scottish, war, and, the, cromwellian, conquest, of, ireland, cromwell, forcibly, disbanded, the, rump, parliament, in, 1653, thereby, establishing, the, protectorate, with, himself, as, lord, protector, upon, his, death, in, 1658, he, was, briefly, succeeded, by, his, ineffective, son, richard, parliament, was, reinstated, and, the, monarchy, was, restored, to, charles, i, s, eldest, son, charles, ii, in, 1660, charles, s, unprecedented, 1642, invasion, of, the, house, of, commons, chamber, a, grave, violation, of, the, liberties, of, parliament, and, his, unsuccessful, attempt, to, arrest, five, members, of, parliament, is, commemorated, annually, at, the, state, opening, of, parliament, partly, inspired, by, his, visit, to, the, spanish, court, in, 1623, charles, became, a, passionate, and, knowledgeable, art, collector, amassing, one, of, the, finest, art, collections, ever, assembled, in, spain, he, sat, for, a, sketch, by, vel, zquez, and, acquired, works, by, titian, and, correggio, among, others, in, england, his, commissions, included, the, ceiling, of, the, banqueting, house, whitehall, by, rubens, and, paintings, by, other, artists, from, the, low, countries, such, as, van, honthorst, mytens, and, van, dyck, his, close, associates, including, the, duke, of, buckingham, and, the, earl, of, arundel, shared, his, interest, and, have, been, dubbed, the, whitehall, group, in, 1627, and, 1628, charles, purchased, the, entire, collection, of, the, duke, of, mantua, which, included, work, by, titian, correggio, raphael, caravaggio, del, sarto, and, mantegna, his, collection, grew, further, to, encompass, bernini, bruegel, leonardo, holbein, hollar, tintoretto, and, veronese, and, self, portraits, by, both, d, rer, and, rembrandt, by, charles, s, death, there, were, an, estimated, 1, 760, paintings, most, of, which, were, sold, and, dispersed, by, parliament, in, the, words, of, john, philipps, kenyon, charles, stuart, is, a, man, of, contradictions, and, controversy, revered, by, high, tories, who, considered, him, a, saintly, martyr, he, was, condemned, by, whig, historians, such, as, samuel, rawson, gardiner, who, thought, him, duplicitous, and, delusional, in, recent, decades, most, historians, have, criticised, him, the, main, exception, being, kevin, sharpe, who, offered, a, more, sympathetic, view, that, has, not, been, widely, adopted, sharpe, argued, that, the, king, was, a, dynamic, man, of, conscience, but, barry, coward, thought, charles, the, most, incompetent, monarch, of, england, since, henry, vi, a, view, shared, by, ronald, hutton, who, called, him, the, worst, king, we, have, had, since, the, middle, ages, archbishop, william, laud, whom, parliament, beheaded, during, the, war, described, charles, as, a, mild, and, gracious, prince, who, knew, not, how, to, be, or, how, to, be, made, great, charles, was, more, sober, and, refined, than, his, father, but, he, was, intransigent, he, deliberately, pursued, unpopular, policies, that, brought, ruin, on, himself, both, charles, and, james, were, advocates, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, but, while, james, s, ambitions, concerning, absolute, prerogative, were, tempered, by, compromise, and, consensus, with, his, subjects, charles, believed, he, had, no, need, to, compromise, or, even, to, explain, his, actions, he, thought, he, was, answerable, only, to, god, princes, are, not, bound, to, give, account, of, their, actions, he, wrote, but, to, god, alone, the, official, style, of, charles, i, as, king, in, england, was, charles, by, the, grace, of, god, king, of, england, scotland,
