demetrius, took, his, army, to, asia, minor, to, support, his, father, antigonus, monophthalmus, pyrrhus, impressed, antigonus, for, he, is, reputed, to, have, said, that, pyrrhus, would, become, the, greatest, general, of, his, time, if, he, lived, long, enough, antigonus, had, grown, too, powerful, and, the, other, successors, seleucus, lysimachus, ptolemy, and, cassander, had, united, against, him, lysimachus, and, seleucus, reinforced, by, two, of, cassander, s, armies, had, concentrated, their, forces, in, asia, minor, and, marched, on, antigonus, both, armies, met, at, ipsus, in, phrygia, the, battle, of, ipsus, was, the, largest, and, most, important, battle, of, the, wars, of, the, successors, pyrrhus, probably, fought, with, demetrius, on, the, right, wing, a, place, of, honour, and, made, a, brilliant, display, of, valour, among, the, combatants, despite, these, brave, efforts, antigonus, lost, both, the, battle, and, his, life, demetrius, victorious, on, his, wing, managed, to, escape, with, 9, 000, men, and, pyrrhus, continued, to, serve, his, brother, in, law, as, he, started, rebuilding, antigonus, empire, in, 298, bc, pyrrhus, was, taken, hostage, to,

egypt, from, her, first, husband, philip, respectively, ptolemy, i, s, wife, and, a, macedonian, noble, in, 297, bc, cassander, died, and, ptolemy, always, looking, for, allies, decided, to, help, restore, pyrrhus, to, his, kingdom, he, provided, pyrrhus, with, men, and, funds, and, sent, him, back, to, epirus, pyrrhus, returned, to, epirus, at, the, head, of, an, army, but, not, willing, to, fight, a, civil, war, he, agreed, to, rule, epirus, together, with, neoptolemus, soon, both, kings, started, to, plot, against, one, another, pyrrhus, was, informed, of, a, plot, against, his, life, and, decided, to, strike, first, he, invited, his, fellow, king, to, a, dinner, and, had, him, murdered, the, act, does, not, appear, to, have, been, unpopular, as, epirus, nobility, seem, to, have, been, devoted, to, him, in, 295, bc, pyrrhus, transferred, the, capital, of, his, kingdom, to, ambracia, in, 292, bc, he, went, to, war, against, his, former, ally, and, brother, in, law, demetrius, by, invading, thessaly, while, demetrius, was, besieging, thebes, demetrius, responded, immediately, he, left, the, siege, to, his, son, antigonus, gonatas, and, marched, back, north, at, the, head, of, a, large, army, pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew, to, epirus, while, he, was, back, in, epirus, pyrrhus, suffered, another, setback, his, second, wife, lanassa, daughter, of, the, self, proclaimed, king, of, sicily, agathocles, of, syracuse, deserted, him, she, claimed, that, she, a, daughter, of, a, greek, king, could, no, longer, bear, to, share, her, home, with, barbarian, women, she, fled, to, corcyra, with, her, dowry, offering, it, and, herself, to, demetrius, he, accepted, sailed, to, the, island, and, took, possession, of, both, corcyra, and, lanassa, after, returning, to, his, army, in, mainland, greece, demetrius, planned, to, invade, epirus, in, 289, bc, he, invaded, pyrrhus, allies, the, aetolian, league, hoping, to, neutralize, them, before, he, invaded, epirus, the, aetolians, refused, battle, and, retreated, into, the, hills, after, ransacking, the, aetolians, countryside, demetrius, left, a, strong, force, under, his, best, general, pantauchus, in, aetolia, and, marched, on, epirus, meanwhile, pyrrhus, had, raised, his, army, and, was, marching, to, the, rescue, of, his, aetolian, allies, the, two, armies, on, different, roads, passed, one, another, and, demetrius, started, plundering, epirus, while, pyrrhus, met, pantauchus, in, battle, pyrrhus, had, the, bulk, of, the, army, of, epirus, with, him, probably, 20, 000, 25, 000, men, while, pantauchus, commanded, but, a, detachment, of, demetrius, army, consisting, of, around, 11, 000, men, the, fighting, was, heavy, and, according, to, the, sources, pantauchus, and, pyrrhus, sought, out, one, another, pantauchus, challenged, pyrrhus, to, individual, combat, and, pyrrhus, accepted, after, hurling, spears, at, each, other, they, fought, it, out, with, swords, pyrrhus, was, wounded, but, in, return, wounded, his, opponent, twice, in, the, thigh, and, in, the, neck, pantauchus, bodyguards, had, to, carry, him, away, emboldened, by, their, king, s, victory, the, epirotes, resumed, their, attack, and, broke, pantauchus, army, and, took, 5, 000, prisoners, the, army, then, honoured, pyrrhus, by, bestowing, the, surname, of, eagle, upon, him, demetrius, upon, hearing, of, pyrrhus, s, victory, marched, back, to, macedon, pyrrhus, released, his, prisoners, and, marched, back, to, epirus, in, 289, bc, pyrrhus, learning, that, demetrius, was, dangerously, ill, invaded, macedonia, his, original, intention, was, merely, to, raid, and, pillage, but, with, demetrius, unable, to, lead, his, forces, he, met, almost, no, opposition, pyrrhus, penetrated, as, far, as, the, old, macedonian, capital, of, aegae, before, demetrius, was, well, enough, to, take, the, field, since, demetrius, commanded, a, superior, force, pyrrhus, had, no, choice, but, to, retreat, demetrius, just, as, restless, as, pyrrhus, planned, to, invade, asia, and, reclaim, his, father, s, old, domains, he, first, made, peace, with, pyrrhus, granting, him, his, holdings, in, macedonia, while, holding, on, to, corcyra, and, leucas, then, he, started, to, raise, a, vast, army, and, a, huge, fleet, faced, with, this, threat, the, other, diadochi, lysimachus, ptolemy, and, seleucus, allied, against, him, the, three, kings, sent, embassies, to, pyrrhus, trying, to, win, him, over, to, their, side, or, at, least, get, him, to, remain, neutral, if, the, allies, won, and, pyrrhus, remained, neutral, he, would, gain, nothing, if, on, the, other, hand, demetrius, would, be, victorious, he, could, overwhelm, pyrrhus, at, any, time, in, the, future, pyrrhus, s, personal, enmity, against, demetrius, might, have, played, an, additional, role, in, his, decision, to, join, the, allies, in, 288, bc, the, allied, kings, began, their, campaigns, against, demetrius, ptolemy, sailed, against, demetrius, s, greek, allies, with, a, large, fleet, lysimachus, invaded, upper, macedonia, from, thrace, pyrrhus, waited, until, demetrius, had, marched, against, lysimachus, and, then, invaded, southern, macedonia, demetrius, must, have, thought, that, pyrrhus, would, not, renege, on, his, treaty, because, western, and, southern, macedonia, fell, without, opposition, meanwhile, demetrius, had, won, a, victory, over, lysimachus, near, amphipolis, when, the, macedonian, army, heard, that, their, homeland, was, being, overrun, by, pyrrhus, they, turned, on, demetrius, they, were, fed, up, with, his, autocratic, rule, and, grandiose, plans, and, refused, to, advance, any, further, demetrius, then, led, his, army, against, pyrrhus, probably, hoping, that, his, macedonians, would, be, more, willing, to, fight, a, foreign, invader, rather, than, lysimachus, a, veteran, of, alexander, unfortunately, for, demetrius, his, troops, were, so, fed, up, with, him, that, they, deserted, to, pyrrhus, and, he, had, to, flee, lysimachus, was, soon, joined, by, pyrrhus, and, they, decided, to, share, rulership, over, macedonia, demetrius, gathered, a, new, army, in, greece, and, besieged, athens, which, had, rebelled, against, the, puppet, government, he, had, installed, the, athenians, called, on, pyrrhus, for, assistance, and, he, marched, against, demetrius, once, more, this, caused, demetrius, to, raise, the, siege, the, athenians, thanked, pyrrhus, by, erecting, a, bust, to, him, and, allowing, him, into, the, city, for, the, celebrations, however, they, did, not, allow, his, army, to, enter, the, city, probably, fearing, pyrrhus, would, install, a, garrison, and, make, himself, overlord, of, athens, pyrrhus, made, the, most, of, the, situation, and, advised, the, athenians, never, to, let, a, king, enter, their, city, again, pyrrhus, and, demetrius, made, peace, once, more, but, like, all, previous, agreements, it, did, not, last, when, demetrius, in, 286, bc, invaded, asia, in, order, to, attack, lysimachus, s, asian, domains, lysimachus, requested, that, pyrrhus, invade, thessaly, and, from, there, attack, demetrius, garrisons, in, greece, pyrrhus, agreed, probably, in, order, to, keep, his, fractious, macedonian, troops, busy, and, less, likely, to, rebel, and, also, to, gain, an, easy, victory, over, the, weakened, antigonids, he, quickly, defeated, antigonus, gonatas, demetrius, s, son, who, ceded, thessaly, to, him, in, order, to, make, peace, pyrrhus, s, greek, empire, was, now, at, its, zenith, he, ruled, an, enlarged, epirus, half, of, macedonia, and, thessaly, in, 285, bc, demetrius, was, defeated, by, seleucus, this, freed, the, hands, of, lysimachus, who, decided, to, get, rid, of, his, co, ruler, in, macedonia, he, first, isolated, pyrrhus, from, his, traditional, ally, the, ptolemies, by, marrying, arsinoe, ii, the, sister, of, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, he, also, made, a, large, donation, to, the, aetolians, pyrrhus, s, main, allies, in, greece, pyrrhus, felt, threatened, enough, to, make, an, alliance, with, antigonus, gonatas, in, 284, bc, lysimachus, invaded, pyrrhus, s, half, of, macedonia, with, a, huge, army, unable, to, stand, against, lysimachus, s, superior, army, pyrrhus, retreated, and, linked, up, with, antigonus, gonatas, lysimachus, started, a, propaganda, campaign, in, which, he, appealed, to, the, patriotism, of, the, macedonians, serving, pyrrhus, he, reminded, them, that, pyrrhus, was, in, fact, a, foreign, king, while, he, himself, was, a, true, macedonian, the, campaign, was, successful, with, his, macedonian, troops, turning, against, him, pyrrhus, had, no, other, choice, but, to, withdraw, to, epirus, lysimachus, invaded, and, plundered, epirus, the, following, year, pyrrhus, did, not, oppose, lysimachus, for, he, was, probably, fighting, a, war, in, illyria, to, the, north, according, to, pausanius, pyrrhus, was, roaming, around, as, usual, the, greek, city, of, tarentum, in, southern, italy, fell, out, with, rome, due, to, a, violation, of, an, old, treaty, that, specified, rome, was, not, to, send, warships, into, the, tarentine, gulf, in, 282, bc, the, romans, installed, garrisons, in, the, greek, cities, of, thurii, on, the, western, end, of, the, tarentine, gulf, locri, and, rhegium, and, sent, warships, to, thurii, although, this, was, designed, as, a, measure, against, the, italian, peoples, of, lucania, the, tarentines, grew, nervous, and, attacked, the, romans, in, thurii, driving, the, roman, garrison, from, the, city, and, sinking, several, roman, warships, tarentum, was, now, faced, with, a, roman, attack, and, certain, defeat, unless, they, could, enlist, the, aid, of, greater, powers, rome, had, already, made, itself, into, a, major, power, and, was, poised, to, subdue, all, the, greek, cities, in, magna, graecia, the, tarentines, asked, pyrrhus, to, lead, their, war, against, the, romans, pyrrhus, was, encouraged, to, aid, the, tarentines, by, the, oracle, of, delphi, he, recognized, the, possibility, of, carving, out, an, empire, for, himself, in, italy, he, made, an, alliance, with, ptolemy, keraunos, king, of, macedon, and, his, most, powerful, neighbor, and, arrived, in, italy, in, 280, bc, pyrrhus, entered, italy, with, an, army, consisting, of, 20, 000, infantry, 3, 000, cavalry, 2, 000, archers, 500, slingers, and, 20, war, elephants, in, a, bid, to, subdue, the, romans, the, elephants, had, been, loaned, to, him, by, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, who, had, also, promised, 9, 000, soldiers, and, a, further, 50, elephants, to, defend, epirus, while, pyrrhus, and, his, army, were, away, due, to, his, superior, cavalry, his, elephants, and, his, deadly, phalanx, infantry, he, defeated, the, romans, led, by, consul, publius, valerius, laevinus, in, the, battle, of, heraclea, in, 280, bc, in, the, roman, province, of, lucania, there, are, conflicting, sources, about, casualties, hieronymus, of, cardia, reports, the, romans, lost, about, 7, 000, while, pyrrhus, lost, 3, 000, soldiers, including, many, of, his, best, dionysius, gives, a, bloodier, view, of, 15, 000, roman, dead, and, 13, 000, epirot, several, tribes, including, the, lucanians, bruttii, messapians, and, the, greek, cities, of, croton, and, locri, joined, pyrrhus, he, then, offered, the, romans, a, peace, treaty, which, was, eventually, rejected, pyrrhus, tried, to, wrest, campania, from, the, romans, but, was, thwarted, in, this, by, the, reinforced, army, of, laevinus, he, then, boldly, marched, on, rome, itself, but, found, its, defences, too, formidable, meanwhile, the, romans, had, made, peace, with, the, etruscans, and, had, recalled, tiberius, coruncanius, the, other, consul, who, was, marching, his, army, southwards, from, etruria, towards, rome, pyrrhus, now, faced, three, armies, the, garrison, of, rome, laevinus, from, the, south, and, curuncanius, from, the, north, not, wanting, to, be, caught, between, three, armies, pyrrhus, withdrew, to, tarentum, where, he, wintered, his, troops, when, pyrrhus, invaded, apulia, 279, bc, the, two, armies, met, in, the, battle, of, asculum, where, pyrrhus, won, a, costly, victory, the, consul, publius, decius, mus, was, the, roman, commander, and, while, his, able, force, was, ultimately, defeated, they, almost, managed, to, break, the, back, of, pyrrhus, epirot, army, guaranteeing, the, security, of, rome, itself, in, the, end, the, romans, lost, 6, 000, men, and, pyrrhus, 3, 500, including, many, officers, pyrrhus, later, famously, commented, on, his, victory, at, asculum, stating, if, we, are, victorious, in, one, more, battle, with, the, romans, we, shall, be, utterly, ruined, it, is, from, reports, of, this, semi, legendary, event, that, the, term, pyrrhic, victory, originates, in, 278, bc, pyrrhus, received, two, offers, simultaneously, the, greek, cities, in, sicily, asked, him, to, come, and, drive, out, carthage, which, along, with, rome, was, one, of, the, two, great, powers, of, the, western, mediterranean, at, the, same, time, the, macedonians, whose, king, ptolemy, keraunos, had, been, killed, by, invading, gauls, asked, pyrrhus, to, ascend, the, throne, of, macedon, pyrrhus, decided, that, sicily, offered, him, a, greater, opportunity, and, sailed, his, army, there, in, 278, bc, soon, after, disembarking, his, army, in, sicily, he, lifted, the, carthaginian, siege, of, syracuse, pyrrhus, was, proclaimed, king, of, sicily, he, was, already, making, plans, for, his, son, helenus, a, grandson, of, agathocles, of, syracuse, through, his, mother, to, inherit, the, kingdom, of, sicily, and, his, other, son, alexander, to, be, given, italy, in, 277, bc, pyrrhus, captured, eryx, the, strongest, carthaginian, fortress, in, sicily, this, prompted, the, rest, of, the, carthaginian, controlled, cities, to, defect, to, pyrrhus, in, 276, bc, pyrrhus, negotiated, with, the, carthaginians, although, they, were, inclined, to, come, to, terms, with, pyrrhus, supply, him, money, and, send, him, ships, once, friendly, relations, were, established, he, demanded, that, carthage, abandon, all, of, sicily, and, make, the, libyan, sea, a, boundary, between, themselves, and, the, greeks, the, greek, cities, of, sicily, opposed, making, peace, with, carthage, because, the, carthaginians, still, controlled, the, powerful, fortress, of, lilybaeum, on, the, western, end, of, the, island, pyrrhus, eventually, gave, in, to, their, proposals, and, broke, off, the, peace, negotiations, pyrrhus, army, then, began, besieging, lilybaeum, for, two, months, he, launched, unsuccessful, assaults, on, the, city, until, finally, he, realized, he, could, not, mount, an, effective, siege, without, blockading, it, from, the, sea, as, well, pyrrhus, then, requested, manpower, and, money, from, the, sicilians, in, order, to, construct, a, powerful, fleet, when, the, sicilians, became, unhappy, about, these, contributions, he, had, to, resort, to, compulsory, contributions, and, force, to, keep, them, in, line, these, measures, culminated, in, him, proclaiming, a, military, dictatorship, of, sicily, and, installing, military, garrisons, in, sicilian, cities, these, actions, were, deeply, unpopular, and, soon, sicilian, opinion, became, inflamed, against, him, pyrrhus, had, so, alienated, the, sicilian, greeks, that, they, were, willing, to, make, common, cause, with, the, carthaginians, the, carthaginians, took, heart, from, this, and, sent, another, army, against, him, this, army, was, promptly, defeated, in, spite, of, this, victory, sicily, continued, to, grow, increasingly, hostile, to, pyrrhus, who, began, to, consider, abandoning, sicily, at, this, point, samnite, and, tarentine, envoys, reached, pyrrhus, and, informed, him, that, of, all, the, greek, cities, in, italy, only, tarentum, had, not, been, conquered, by, rome, pyrrhus, made, his, decision, and, departed, from, sicily, as, his, ship, left, the, island, he, turned, and, foreshadowing, the, punic, wars, said, to, his, companions, what, a, wrestling, ground, we, are, leaving, my, friends, for, the, carthaginians, and, the, romans, while, his, army, was, being, transported, by, ship, to, mainland, italy, pyrrhus, navy, was, destroyed, by, the, carthaginians, at, the, battle, of, the, strait, of, messina, with, 98, warships, sunk, or, disabled, out, of, 110, while, pyrrhus, had, been, campaigning, against, the, carthaginians, the, romans, had, rebuilt, their, army, by, calling, up, thousands, of, fresh, recruits, near, today, s, benevento, one, of, the, two, roman, consuls, for, that, year, 275, bc, manius, curius, dentatus, had, camped, with, his, men, the, other, highness, was, at, that, time, in, lucania, so, pyrrhus, sent, against, him, part, of, his, army, to, prevent, him, from, reinforcing, curius, whom, pyrrhus, himself, was, left, to, deal, with, he, set, out, at, night, in, order, to, reach, his, enemy, secretly, however, the, dense, vegetation, of, the, area, caused, problems, for, his, men, who, finally, arrived, at, daylight, when, they, were, tired, and, impossible, to, pass, unnoticed, as, a, result, the, attack, was, repulsed, with, pyrrhus, losing, half, of, his, elephants, the, next, day, the, romans, took, the, initiative, of, the, attack, their, initial, attack, thanks, to, the, cunning, of, pyrrhus, and, the, strong, resistance, of, the, epirotes, failed, however, a, second, wave, frightened, the, elephants, possibly, with, flaming, arrows, causing, them, to, rush, against, the, epirotes, the, latter, left, the, battlefield, in, disorder, and, pyrrhus, had, no, choice, but, to, withdraw, from, the, battle, after, this, inconclusive, battle, pyrrhus, decided, to, end, his, campaign, in, italy, and, return, to, epirus, which, resulted, in, the, loss, of, essentially, all, the, gains, he, had, made, in, italy, only, the, city, of, tarentum, remained, under, the, dominion, of, the, epirotes, his, western, campaign, had, taken, a, heavy, toll, on, his, army, as, well, as, his, treasury, despite, or, perhaps, because, of, this, pyrrhus, went, to, war, yet, again, the, realm, of, his, rival, king, antigonus, gonatas, of, macedon, was, the, most, obvious, target, pyrrhus, raised, an, army, from, his, epirote, garrisons, gallic, mercenaries, and, the, troops, he, had, brought, back, from, italy, and, marched, east, into, macedon, he, won, an, easy, victory, at, the, battle, of, the, aous, and, took, most, of, macedon, antigonus, managed, to, hold, on, to, a, number, of, coastal, cities, he, then, waited, for, an, opportunity, to, reclaim, his, kingdom, while, pyrrhus, was, already, looking, for, another, war, to, fight, furthermore, pyrrhus, made, himself, very, unpopular, in, macedon, by, allowing, his, gauls, to, plunder, the, tombs, of, the, macedonian, kings, at, aegae, in, 272, bc, cleonymus, a, spartan, of, royal, blood, who, was, hated, among, fellow, spartans, asked, pyrrhus, to, attack, sparta, and, place, him, in, power, pyrrhus, agreed, to, the, plan, intending, to, win, control, of, the, peloponnese, for, himself, but, unexpected, strong, resistance, thwarted, his, assault, on, sparta, on, the, retreat, he, lost, his, firstborn, son, ptolemy, who, had, been, in, command, of, the, rearguard, pyrrhus, had, little, time, to, mourn, as, he, was, immediately, offered, an, opportunity, to, intervene, in, a, civic, dispute, in, argos, since, antigonus, gonatas, was, approaching, too, he, hastened, to, enter, the, city, with, his, army, by, stealth, only, to, find, the, place, crowded, with, hostile, troops, during, the, confused, battle, of, argos, in, the, narrow, city, streets, pyrrhus, was, trapped, while, he, was, fighting, an, argive, soldier, the, soldier, s, old, mother, who, was, watching, from, a, rooftop, threw, a, tile, which, knocked, him, from, his, horse, and, broke, part, of, his, spine, paralyzing, him, whether, he, was, alive, or, not, after, the, blow, is, unknown, but, his, death, was, assured, when, a, macedonian, soldier, named, zopyrus, though, frightened, by, the, look, on, the, face, of, the, unconscious, king, hesitantly, and, ineptly, beheaded, his, motionless, body, this, story, is, later, recounted, by, plutarch, in, his, life, of, pyrrhus, antigonus, had, him, cremated, with, all, honours, and, sent, his, surviving, son, helenus, back, to, epirus, that, same, year, upon, hearing, the, news, of, pyrrhus, s, death, the, tarentinians, surrendered, to, rome, in, his, life, of, pyrrhus, plutarch, records, that, hannibal, ranked, him, as, the, greatest, commander, the, world, had, ever, seen, though, in, the, life, of, titus, quinctius, flamininus, plutarch, writes, that, hannibal, placed, him, second, after, alexander, the, great, this, latter, account, is, also, given, by, appian, while, he, was, a, mercurial, and, often, restless, leader, and, not, always, a, wise, king, he, was, considered, one, of, the, greatest, military, commanders, of, his, time, pyrrhus, was, known, for, his, benevolence, as, a, general, pyrrhus, s, greatest, political, weaknesses, were, his, failures, to, maintain, focus, and, to, maintain, a, strong, treasury, at, home, many, of, his, soldiers, were, costly, mercenaries, the, concept, of, a, monarch, having, a, touch, that, could, heal, all, wounds, may, have, originated, with, pyrrhus, as, pliny, the, elder, states, pyrrhus, great, toe, on, his, right, foot, cured, diseases, of, the, spleen, by, merely, touching, the, patient, his, toe, could, also, not, be, burned, so, when, his, body, was, cremated, his, toe, was, put, in, a, coffer, and, kept, at, an, unknown, temple, pyrrhus, lends, his, name, to, the, term, pyrrhic, victory, which, stems, from, a, statement, he, is, alleged, to, have, made, following, the, battle, of, asculum, in, response, to, congratulations, for, winning, a, costly, victory, over, the, romans, he, is, reported, to, have, said, if, we, are, victorious, in, one, more, battle, with, the, romans, we, shall, be, utterly, ruined, the, term, pyrrhic, victory, has, therefore, come, to, signify, a, victory, that, was, won, at, such, cost, that, it, loses, all, worth, pyrrhus, and, his, campaign, in, italy, provided, the, greek, world, with, an, opportunity, to, check, the, advance, of, rome, further, into, the, mediterranean, the, failure, to, fully, exploit, this, opportunity, while, rome, was, still, only, an, italian, regional, power, had, immense, consequences, the, conquest, of, magna, graecia, by, the, romans, brought, them, into, direct, competition, with, carthage, ultimately, leading, to, the, first, punic, war, rome, s, victory, in, this, conflict, arguably, transformed, it, from, a, regional, power, to, one, of, the, most, powerful, states, in, the, mediterranean, over, the, next, century, the, failure, of, the, various, kingdoms, and, city, states, of, the, hellenistic, world, to, put, on, a, united, front, against, rome, resulted, in, their, absorption, into, the, roman, empire, or, in, the, case, of, some, the, reduction, to, the, status, of, a, roman, client, state, by, 197, bc, macedonia, and, many, southern, greek, city, states, became, roman, client, states, in,
