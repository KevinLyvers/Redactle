small, forward, the, position, he, would, primarily, play, during, his, second, return, to, professional, basketball, with, the, washington, wizards, and, as, a, point, guard, jordan, was, known, throughout, his, career, as, a, strong, clutch, performer, with, the, bulls, he, decided, 25, games, with, field, goals, or, free, throws, in, the, last, 30, seconds, including, two, nba, finals, games, and, five, other, playoff, contests, his, competitiveness, was, visible, in, his, prolific, trash, talk, and, well, known, work, ethic, jordan, often, used, perceived, slights, to, fuel, his, performances, sportswriter, wright, thompson, described, him, as, a, killer, in, the, darwinian, sense, of, the, word, immediately, sensing, and, attacking, someone, s, weakest, spot, as, the, bulls, organization, built, the, franchise, around, jordan, management, had, to, trade, away, players, who, were, not, tough, enough, to, compete, with, him, in, practice, to, improve, his, defense, jordan, spent, hours, studying, film, of, opponents, on, offense, he, relied, more, upon, instinct, and, improvization, noted, as, a, durable, player, jordan, did, not, miss, four, or, more, games, while, active, for, a, full, season, from, 1986, 87, to, 2001, 02, when, he, injured, his, right, knee, of, the, 15, seasons, jordan, was, in, the, nba, he, played, all, 82, regular, season, games, nine, times, jordan, has, frequently, cited, david, thompson, walter, davis, and, jerry, west, as, influences, confirmed, at, the, start, of, his, career, and, possibly, later, on, jordan, had, a, special, love, of, the, game, clause, written, into, his, contract, which, was, unusual, at, the, time, and, allowed, him, to, play, basketball, against, anyone, at, any, time, anywhere, jordan, had, a, versatile, offensive, game, and, was, capable, of, aggressively, driving, to, the, basket, as, well, as, drawing, fouls, from, his, opponents, at, a, high, rate, his, 8, 772, free, throw, attempts, are, the, 11th, highest, total, in, nba, history, early, in, jordan, s, career, he, weighed, in, at, around, 200, pounds, 91, kg, and, was, more, athletic, in, terms, of, play, style, as, his, career, progressed, jordan, also, developed, the, ability, to, post, up, his, opponents, and, score, with, his, trademark, fadeaway, jump, shot, using, his, leaping, ability, to, avoid, block, attempts, according, to, hubie, brown, this, move, alone, made, jordan, nearly, unstoppable, around, this, time, he, bulked, up, to, 215, pounds, 98, kg, in, order, to, adapt, to, the, increased, physicality, of, nba, defenses, during, the, 1990s, sacrificing, some, athleticism, for, added, strength, in, the, post, despite, media, criticism, by, some, as, a, selfish, player, early, in, his, career, jordan, was, willing, to, defer, to, this, teammates, with, a, career, average, of, 5, 3, apg, and, a, season, high, of, 8, 0, apg, for, a, guard, jordan, was, also, a, good, rebounder, finishing, with, 6, 2,

improved, his, three, point, shooting, and, finished, his, career, with, a, respectable, 32, success, rate, his, three, point, field, goal, percentages, ranged, from, 35, to, 43, in, seasons, where, jordan, attempted, at, least, 230, three, pointers, between, 1989, 90, and, 1996, 97, his, effective, field, goal, percentage, was, 50, and, he, had, six, seasons, with, at, least, 50, shooting, five, of, which, consecutively, 1988, 1992, jordan, also, shot, 51, and, 50, and, 30, and, 33, from, the, three, point, range, throughout, his, first, and, second, retirements, respectively, finishing, his, bulls, career, with, 31, 5, points, per, game, on, 50, 5, fg, shooting, and, his, overall, career, with, 49, 7, fg, shooting, unlike, nba, players, often, compared, to, jordan, such, as, kobe, bryant, and, lebron, james, who, had, a, similar, three, point, percentage, he, did, not, shoot, as, many, threes, as, they, did, as, jordan, did, not, need, to, rely, on, the, three, pointer, to, be, effective, on, offense, three, point, shooting, was, only, introduced, in, 1979, and, would, not, be, a, more, fundamental, aspect, of, the, game, until, the, first, decades, of, the, 21st, century, with, the, nba, having, to, briefly, shorten, the, line, to, incentivize, more, shots, jordan, s, three, point, shooting, was, better, selected, resulting, in, three, point, field, goals, made, in, important, games, during, the, playoffs, and, the, finals, such, as, hitting, six, consecutive, three, point, shots, in, game, 1, of, the, 1992, nba, finals, jordan, shot, 37, 35, 42, and, 37, in, all, the, seasons, he, shot, over, 200, three, pointers, and, also, shot, 38, 5, 38, 6, 38, 9, 40, 3, 19, 4, and, 30, 2, in, the, playoffs, during, his, championship, runs, improving, his, shooting, even, after, the, three, point, line, reverted, to, the, original, line, in, 1988, jordan, was, honored, with, the, nba, defensive, player, of, the, year, and, the, most, valuable, player, awards, becoming, the, first, nba, player, to, win, both, awards, in, a, career, let, alone, season, he, also, set, both, seasonal, and, career, records, for, blocked, shots, by, a, guard, and, combined, this, with, his, ball, thieving, ability, to, become, a, standout, defensive, player, jordan, ranks, fourth, in, nba, history, in, total, steals, with, 2, 514, trailing, john, stockton, jason, kidd, and, chris, paul, jerry, west, often, stated, that, he, was, more, impressed, with, jordan, s, defensive, contributions, than, his, offensive, ones, doc, rivers, declared, jordan, the, best, superstar, defender, in, the, history, of, the, game, jordan, was, known, to, have, strong, eyesight, broadcaster, al, michaels, said, that, jordan, was, able, to, read, baseball, box, scores, on, a, 27, inch, 69, cm, television, clearly, from, about, 50, feet, 15, m, away, during, the, 2001, nba, finals, phil, jackson, compared, jordan, s, dominance, to, shaquille, o, neal, stating, michael, would, get, fouled, on, every, play, and, still, have, to, play, through, it, and, just, clear, himself, for, shots, instead, and, would, rise, to, that, occasion, jordan, s, talent, was, clear, from, his, first, nba, season, by, november, 1984, he, was, being, compared, to, julius, erving, larry, bird, said, that, rookie, jordan, was, the, best, player, he, ever, saw, and, that, jordan, was, one, of, a, kind, and, comparable, to, wayne, gretzky, as, an, athlete, in, his, first, game, in, madison, square, garden, against, the, new, york, knicks, jordan, received, a, near, minute, long, standing, ovation, after, jordan, established, the, single, game, playoff, record, of, 63, points, against, the, boston, celtics, on, april, 20, 1986, bird, described, him, as, god, disguised, as,
