captain, robert, falcon, scott, cvo, 6, june, 1868, c, 29, march, 1912, was, a, british, royal, navy, officer, and, explorer, who, led, two, expeditions, to, the, antarctic, regions, the, discovery, expedition, of, 1901, 04, and, the, terra, nova, expedition, of, 1910, 13, on, the, first, expedition, he, set, a, new, southern, record, by, marching, to, latitude, 82, s, and, discovered, the, antarctic, plateau, on, which, the, south, pole, is, located, on, the, second, venture, scott, led, a, party, of, five, which, reached, the, south, pole, on, 17, january, 1912, less, than, five, weeks, after, amundsen, s, south, pole, expedition, on, the, return, journey, from, the, pole, a, planned, meeting, with, supporting, dog, teams, from, the, base, camp, failed, despite, scott, s, written, instructions, and, at, a, distance, of, 162, miles, 261, km, from, their, base, camp, at, hut, point, and, approximately, 12, 5, miles, 20, 1, km, from, the, next, depot, scott, and, his, companions, died, when, scott, and, his, party, s, bodies, were, discovered, they, had, in, their, possession, the, first, antarctic, fossils, discovered, the, fossils, were, determined, to, be, from, the, glossopteris, tree, and, proved, that, antarctica, was, once, forested, and, joined, to, other, continents, before, his, appointment, to, lead, the, discovery, expedition, scott, had, a, career, as, a, royal, navy, officer, in, 1899, he, had, a, chance, encounter, with, sir, clements, markham, the, president, of, the, royal, geographical, society, and, learned, of, a, planned, antarctic, expedition, which, he, soon, volunteered, to, lead, his, name, became, inseparably, associated, with, the, antarctic, the, field, of, work, to, which, he, remained, committed, during, the, final, 12, years, of, his, life, following, the, news, of, his, death, scott, became, a, celebrated, hero, a, status, reflected, by, memorials, erected, across, the, uk, however, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, questions, were, raised, about, his, competence, and, character, commentators, in, the, 21st, century, have, regarded, scott, more, positively, after, assessing, the, temperature, drop, below, 40, c, 40, f, in, march, 1912, and, after, re, discovering, scott, s, written, orders, of, october, 1911, in, which, he, had, instructed, the, dog, teams, to, meet, and, assist, him, on, the, return, trip, scott, was, born, on, 6, june, 1868, the, third, of, six, children, and, elder, son, of, john, edward, a, brewer, and, magistrate, and, hannah, n, e, cuming, scott, of, stoke, damerel, near, devonport, there, were, also, naval, and, military, traditions, in, the, family, scott, s, grandfather, and, four, uncles, all, having, served, in, the, army, or, navy, john, scott, s, prosperity, came, from, the, ownership, of, a, small, plymouth, brewery, which, he, had, inherited, from, his, father, and, subsequently, sold, scott, s, early, childhood, years, were, spent, in, comfort, but, some, years, later, when, he, was, establishing, his, naval, career, the, family, suffered, serious, financial, misfortune, in, accordance, with, the, family, s, tradition, scott, and, his, younger, brother, archie, were, predestined, for, careers, in, the, armed, services, scott, spent, four, years, at, a, local, day, school, before, being, sent, to, stubbington, house, school, in, hampshire, a, cramming, establishment, that, prepared, candidates, for, the, entrance, examinations, to, the, naval, training, ship, hms, britannia, at, dartmouth, having, passed, these, exams, scott, began, his, naval, career, in, 1881, as, a, 13, year, old, cadet, in, july, 1883, scott, passed, out, of, britannia, as, a, midshipman, seventh, overall, in, a, class, of, 26, by, october, he, was, en, route, to, south, africa, to, join, hms, boadicea, the, flagship, of, the, cape, squadron, the, first, of, several, ships, on, which, he, served, during, his, midshipman, years, while, stationed, in, st, kitts, west, indies, on, hms, rover, he, had, his, first, encounter, with, clements, markham, then, secretary, of, the, royal, geographical, society, who, would, loom, large, in, scott, s, later, career, on, this, occasion, 1, march, 1887, markham, observed, midshipman, scott, s, cutter, winning, that, morning, s, race, across, the, bay, markham, s, habit, was, to, collect, likely, young, naval, officers, with, a, view, to, their, undertaking, polar, exploration, work, in, the, future, he, was, impressed, by, scott, s, intelligence, enthusiasm, and, charm, and, the, 18, year, old, midshipman, was, duly, noted, in, march, 1888, scott, passed, his, examinations, for, sub, lieutenant, with, four, first, class, certificates, out, of, five, his, career, progressed, smoothly, with, service, on, various, ships, and, promotion, to, lieutenant, in, 1889, in, 1891, after, a, long, spell, in, foreign, waters, he, applied, for, the, two, year, torpedo, training, course, on, hms, vernon, an, important, career, step, he, graduated, with, first, class, certificates, in, both, the, theory, and, practical, examinations, a, small, blot, occurred, in, the, summer, of, 1893, when, while, commanding, a, torpedo, boat, scott, ran, it, aground, a, mishap, which, earned, him, a, mild, rebuke, during, the, research, for, his, dual, biography, of, scott, and, roald, amundsen, polar, historian, roland, huntford, investigated, a, possible, scandal, in, scott, s, early, naval, career, related, to, the, period, 1889, 1890, when, scott, was, a, lieutenant, on, hms, amphion, according, to, huntford, scott, disappears, from, naval, records, for, eight, months, from, mid, august, 1889, until, 26, march, 1890, huntford, hints, at, involvement, with, a, married, american, woman, a, cover, up, and, protection, by, senior, officers, biographer, david, crane, reduces, the, missing, period, to, eleven, weeks, but, is, unable, to, clarify, further, he, rejects, the, notion, of, protection, by, senior, officers, on, the, grounds, that, scott, was, not, important, or, well, connected, enough, to, warrant, this, documents, that, may, have, offered, explanations, are, missing, from, admiralty, records, in, 1894, while, serving, as, torpedo, officer, on, the, depot, ship, hms, vulcan, scott, learned, of, the, financial, calamity, that, had, overtaken, his, family, john, scott, having, sold, the, brewery, and, invested, the, proceeds, unwisely, had, lost, all, his, capital, and, was, now, virtually, bankrupt, at, the, age, of, 63, and, in, poor, health, he, was, forced, to, take, a, job, as, a, brewery, manager, and, move, his, family, to, shepton, mallet, somerset, three, years, later, while, robert, was, serving, with, the, channel, squadron, flagship, hms, majestic, john, scott, died, of, heart, disease, creating, a, fresh, family, crisis, hannah, scott, and, her, two, unmarried, daughters, now, relied, entirely, on, the, service, pay, of, scott, and, the, salary, of, younger, brother, archie, who, had, left, the, army, for, a, higher, paid, post, in, the, colonial, service, archie, s, own, death, in, the, autumn, of, 1898, after, contracting, typhoid, fever, meant, that, the, whole, financial, responsibility, for, the, family, rested, on, scott, promotion, and, the, extra, income, this, would, bring, now, became, a, matter, of, considerable, concern, to, scott, in, the, royal, navy, however, opportunities, for, career, advancement, were, both, limited, and, keenly, sought, after, by, ambitious, officers, early, in, june, 1899, while, home, on, leave, he, had, a, chance, encounter, in, a, london, street, with, clements, markham, who, was, now, knighted, and, president, of, the, royal, geographical, society, rgs, and, learned, for, the, first, time, of, an, impending, antarctic, expedition, with, discovery, under, the, auspices, of, the, rgs, it, was, the, opportunity, for, early, command, and, a, chance, to, distinguish, himself, rather, than, any, predilection, for, polar, exploration, which, motivated, scott, according, to, crane, what, passed, between, them, on, this, occasion, is, not, recorded, but, a, few, days, later, on, 11, june, scott, appeared, at, the, markham, residence, and, volunteered, to, lead, the, expedition, the, british, national, antarctic, expedition, later, known, as, the, discovery, expedition, was, a, joint, enterprise, of, the, rgs, and, the, royal, society, a, long, cherished, dream, of, markham, s, it, required, all, of, his, skills, and, cunning, to, bring, the, expedition, to, fruition, under, naval, command, and, largely, staffed, by, naval, personnel, scott, may, not, have, been, markham, s, first, choice, as, leader, but, having, decided, on, him, the, older, man, remained, a, constant, supporter, there, were, committee, battles, over, the, scope, of, scott, s, responsibilities, with, the, royal, society, pressing, to, put, a, scientist, in, charge, of, the, expedition, s, programme, while, scott, merely, commanded, the, ship, eventually, however, markham, s, view, prevailed, scott, was, given, overall, command, and, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, commander, before, discovery, sailed, for, the, antarctic, on, 6, august, 1901, king, edward, vii, who, showed, a, keen, interest, in, the, expedition, visited, the, discovery, the, day, before, the, ship, left, british, shores, in, august, 1901, and, during, the, visit, appointed, scott, a, member, fourth, class, of, the, royal, victorian, order, his, personal, gift, experience, of, antarctic, or, arctic, waters, was, almost, entirely, lacking, within, the, 50, strong, party, and, there, was, very, little, special, training, in, equipment, or, techniques, before, the, ship, set, sail, dogs, were, taken, as, were, skis, but, the, dogs, succumbed, to, disease, in, the, first, season, nevertheless, the, dogs, performance, impressed, scott, and, despite, moral, qualms, he, implemented, the, principle, of, slaughtering, dogs, for, dog, food, to, increase, the, others, range, during, an, early, attempt, at, ice, travel, a, blizzard, trapped, expedition, members, in, their, tent, and, their, decision, to, leave, it, resulted, in, the, death, of, george, vince, who, slipped, over, a, precipice, on, 11, march, 1902, the, expedition, also, experienced, problems, with, scurvy, which, affected, scott, s, domestic, reputation, the, expedition, had, both, scientific, and, exploration, objectives, the, latter, included, a, long, journey, south, in, the, direction, of, the, south, pole, this, march, undertaken, by, scott, ernest, shackleton, and, edward, wilson, took, them, to, a, latitude, of, 82, 17, s, about, 530, miles, 850, km, from, the, pole, a, harrowing, return, journey, brought, about, shackleton, s, physical, collapse, and, his, early, departure, from, the, expedition, the, second, year, showed, improvements, in, technique, and, achievement, culminating, in, scott, s, western, journey, which, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, polar, plateau, this, has, been, described, by, one, writer, as, one, of, the, great, polar, journeys, the, scientific, results, of, the, expedition, included, important, biological, zoological, and, geological, findings, some, of, the, meteorological, and, magnetic, readings, however, were, later, criticised, as, amateurish, and, inaccurate, at, the, end, of, the, expedition, it, took, the, combined, efforts, of, two, relief, ships, and, the, use, of, explosives, to, free, discovery, from, the, ice, scott, s, insistence, during, the, expedition, on, royal, navy, formalities, had, made, for, uneasy, relations, with, the, merchant, navy, contingent, many, of, whom, departed, for, home, with, the, first, relief, ship, in, march, 1903, second, in, command, albert, armitage, a, merchant, officer, was, offered, the, chance, to, go, home, on, compassionate, grounds, but, interpreted, the, offer, as, a, personal, slight, and, refused, armitage, also, promoted, the, idea, that, the, decision, to, send, shackleton, home, on, the, relief, ship, arose, from, scott, s, animosity, rather, than, shackleton, s, physical, breakdown, although, there, was, later, tension, between, scott, and, shackleton, when, their, polar, ambitions, directly, clashed, mutual, civilities, were, preserved, in, public, scott, joined, in, the, official, receptions, that, greeted, shackleton, on, his, return, in, 1909, after, the, nimrod, expedition, and, the, two, exchanged, polite, letters, about, their, respective, ambitions, in, 1909, 1910, discovery, returned, to, britain, in, september, 1904, the, expedition, had, caught, the, public, imagination, and, scott, became, a, popular, hero, he, was, awarded, a, cluster, of, honours, and, medals, including, many, from, overseas, and, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, captain, he, was, invited, to, balmoral, castle, and, king, edward, vii, promoted, him, to, commander, of, the, royal, victorian, order, scott, s, next, few, years, were, crowded, for, more, than, a, year, he, was, occupied, with, public, receptions, lectures, and, the, writing, of, the, expedition, record, the, voyage, of, the, discovery, in, january, 1906, he, resumed, his, full, time, naval, career, first, as, an, assistant, director, of, naval, intelligence, at, the, admiralty, and, in, august, as, flag, captain, to, rear, admiral, sir, george, egerton, on, hms, victorious, he, was, now, moving, in, ever, more, exalted, social, circles, a, telegram, to, markham, in, february, 1907, refers, to, meetings, with, queen, am, lie, of, orl, ans, and, luis, filipe, prince, royal, of, portugal, and, a, later, letter, home, reports, lunching, with, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, fleet, and, prince, heinrich, of, prussia, the, telegram, related, to, a, collision, involving, scott, s, ship, hms, albemarle, scott, was, cleared, of, blame, hms, albemarle, a, battleship, commanded, by, scott, collided, with, the, battleship, hms, commonwealth, on, 11, february, 1907, suffering, minor, bow, damage, by, early, 1906, scott, queried, the, rgs, about, the, possible, funding, of, a, future, antarctic, expedition, it, was, therefore, unwelcome, news, to, him, that, ernest, shackleton, had, announced, his, own, plans, to, travel, to, discovery, s, old, mcmurdo, sound, base, and, launch, a, bid, for, the, south, pole, from, there, scott, claimed, in, the, first, of, a, series, of, letters, to, shackleton, that, the, area, around, mcmurdo, was, his, own, field, of, work, to, which, he, had, prior, rights, until, he, chose, to, give, them, up, and, that, shackleton, should, therefore, work, from, an, entirely, different, area, in, this, he, was, strongly, supported, by, discovery, s, former, zoologist, edward, wilson, who, asserted, that, scott, s, rights, extended, to, the, entire, ross, sea, sector, shackleton, refused, to, concede, according, to, a, letter, written, to, stanfords, bookshop, owner, edward, stanford, scott, seemed, to, take, offence, with, a, map, that, was, published, that, had, shown, how, far, south, scott, and, shackleton, had, travelled, during, the, discovery, expedition, scott, implied, in, this, letter, dated, in, 1907, and, discovered, in, the, shop, archives, in, 2018, that, having, the, two, men, s, names, together, on, this, map, indicated, that, there, was, dual, leadership, between, scott, and, shackleton, which, was, not, in, accordance, with, fact, after, the, owner, replied, with, an, apology, over, the, issue, scott, expressed, his, regret, at, the, nature, of, the, previous, letter, and, stated, i, tried, to, be, impartial, in, giving, credit, to, my, companions, who, one, and, all, laboured, honestly, and, well, as, i, have, endeavoured, to, record, i, understand, now, of, course, that, you, had, no, personal, knowledge, of, the, wording, and, i, must, express, regret, that, i, failed, to, realise, your, identity, when, i, first, wrote, finally, to, end, the, impasse, shackleton, agreed, in, a, letter, to, scott, dated, 17, may, 1907, to, work, to, the, east, of, the, 170, w, meridian, and, therefore, to, avoid, all, the, familiar, discovery, ground, in, the, end, it, was, a, promise, that, he, was, unable, to, keep, after, his, search, for, alternative, landing, grounds, proved, fruitless, with, his, only, other, option, being, to, return, home, he, set, up, his, headquarters, at, cape, royds, close, to, the, old, discovery, base, for, this, he, was, roundly, condemned, by, the, british, polar, establishment, at, the, time, among, modern, polar, writers, ranulph, fiennes, regards, shackleton, s, actions, as, a, technical, breach, of, honour, but, adds, my, personal, belief, is, that, shackleton, was, basically, honest, but, circumstances, forced, his, mcmurdo, landing, much, to, his, distress, the, polar, historian, beau, riffenburgh, states, that, the, promise, to, scott, should, never, ethically, have, been, demanded, and, compares, scott, s, intransigence, on, this, matter, unfavourably, with, the, generous, attitudes, of, the, norwegian, explorer, fridtjof, nansen, who, gave, freely, of, his, advice, and, expertise, to, all, whether, they, were, potential, rivals, or, not, scott, who, because, of, his, discovery, fame, had, entered, edwardian, society, first, met, kathleen, bruce, early, in, 1907, at, a, private, luncheon, party, she, was, a, sculptor, socialite, and, cosmopolitan, who, had, studied, under, auguste, rodin, and, whose, circle, included, isadora, duncan, pablo, picasso, and, aleister, crowley, her, initial, meeting, with, scott, was, brief, but, when, they, met, again, later, that, year, the, mutual, attraction, was, obvious, a, stormy, courtship, followed, scott, was, not, her, only, suitor, his, main, rival, was, would, be, novelist, gilbert, cannan, and, his, absences, at, sea, did, not, assist, his, cause, however, scott, s, persistence, was, rewarded, and, on, 2, september, 1908, at, the, chapel, royal, hampton, court, palace, the, wedding, took, place, their, only, child, peter, markham, scott, born, 14, september, 1909, was, to, found, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, wwf, shackleton, returned, from, the, antarctic, having, narrowly, failed, to, reach, the, pole, and, this, gave, scott, the, impetus, to, proceed, with, plans, for, his, second, antarctic, expedition, on, 24, march, 1909, he, took, the, admiralty, based, appointment, of, naval, assistant, to, the, second, sea, lord, which, placed, him, conveniently, in, london, in, december, he, was, released, on, half, pay, to, take, up, the, full, time, command, of, the, british, antarctic, expedition, 1910, to, be, known, as, the, terra, nova, expedition, from, its, ship, terra, nova, it, was, the, expressed, hope, of, the, rgs, that, this, expedition, would, be, scientific, primarily, with, exploration, and, the, pole, as, secondary, objects, but, unlike, the, discovery, expedition, neither, they, nor, the, royal, society, were, in, charge, this, time, in, his, expedition, prospectus, scott, stated, that, its, main, objective, was, to, reach, the, south, pole, and, to, secure, for, the, british, empire, the, honour, of, this, achievement, scott, had, as, markham, observed, been, bitten, by, the, pole, mania, in, a, memorandum, of, 1908, scott, presented, his, view, that, man, hauling, to, the, south, pole, was, impossible, and, that, motor, traction, was, needed, snow, vehicles, did, not, yet, exist, however, and, so, his, engineer, reginald, skelton, developed, the, idea, of, a, caterpillar, track, for, snow, surfaces, in, the, middle, of, 1909, scott, realised, that, motors, were, unlikely, to, get, him, all, the, way, to, the, pole, and, decided, additionally, to, take, horses, based, on, shackleton, s, near, success, in, attaining, the, pole, using, ponies, dogs, and, skis, after, consultation, with, nansen, during, trials, of, the, motors, in, norway, in, march, 1910, man, hauling, would, still, be, needed, on, the, polar, plateau, on, the, assumption, that, motors, and, animals, could, not, ascend, the, crevassed, beardmore, glacier, dog, expert, cecil, meares, was, going, to, siberia, to, select, the, dogs, and, scott, ordered, that, while, he, was, there, he, should, deal, with, the, purchase, of, manchurian, ponies, meares, was, not, an, experienced, horse, dealer, and, the, ponies, he, chose, proved, mostly, of, poor, quality, and, ill, suited, to, prolonged, antarctic, work, meanwhile, scott, also, recruited, bernard, day, from, shackleton, s, expedition, as, his, motor, expert, on, 15, june, 1910, scott, s, ship, terra, nova, an, old, converted, whaler, set, sail, from, cardiff, south, wales, scott, meanwhile, was, fundraising, in, britain, and, joined, the, ship, later, in, south, africa, arriving, in, melbourne, australia, in, october, 1910, scott, received, a, telegram, from, amundsen, stating, beg, leave, to, inform, you, fram, proceeding, antarctic, amundsen, possibly, indicating, that, scott, faced, a, race, to, the, pole, the, expedition, suffered, a, series, of, early, misfortunes, which, hampered, the, first, season, s, work, and, impaired, preparations, for, the, main, polar, march, on, its, journey, from, new, zealand, to, the, antarctic, terra, nova, nearly, sank, in, a, storm, and, was, then, trapped, in, pack, ice, for, 20, days, far, longer, than, other, ships, had, experienced, which, meant, a, late, season, arrival, and, less, time, for, preparatory, work, before, the, antarctic, winter, at, cape, evans, antarctica, one, of, the, motor, sledges, was, lost, during, its, unloading, from, the, ship, breaking, through, the, sea, ice, and, sinking, deteriorating, weather, conditions, and, weak, unacclimatised, ponies, affected, the, initial, depot, laying, journey, so, that, the, expedition, s, main, supply, point, one, ton, depot, was, laid, 35, miles, 56, km, north, of, its, planned, location, at, 80, s, lawrence, oates, in, charge, of, the, ponies, advised, scott, to, kill, ponies, for, food, and, advance, the, depot, to, 80, s, which, scott, refused, to, do, oates, is, reported, as, saying, to, scott, sir, i, m, afraid, you, ll, come, to, regret, not, taking, my, advice, four, ponies, died, during, this, journey, either, from, the, cold, or, because, they, slowed, the, team, down, and, were, shot, on, its, return, to, base, the, expedition, learned, of, the, presence, of, amundsen, camped, with, his, crew, and, a, large, contingent, of, dogs, in, the, bay, of, whales, 200, miles, 320, km, to, their, east, scott, conceded, that, his, ponies, would, not, be, able, to, start, early, enough, in, the, season, to, compete, with, amundsen, s, cold, tolerant, dog, teams, for, the, pole, and, also, acknowledged, that, the, norwegian, s, base, was, closer, to, the, pole, by, 69, miles, 111, km, wilson, was, more, hopeful, whereas, gran, shared, scott, s, concern, shortly, afterwards, the, death, toll, among, the, ponies, increased, to, six, three, drowning, when, sea, ice, unexpectedly, disintegrated, casting, in, doubt, the, possibility, of, reaching, the, pole, at, all, however, during, the, 1911, winter, scott, s, confidence, increased, on, 2, august, after, the, return, of, a, three, man, party, from, their, winter, journey, to, cape, crozier, scott, wrote, i, feel, sure, we, are, as, near, perfection, as, experience, can, direct, scott, outlined, his, plans, for, the, southern, journey, to, the, entire, shore, party, leaving, open, who, would, form, the, final, polar, team, according, to, their, performance, during, the, polar, travel, eleven, days, before, scott, s, teams, set, off, towards, the, pole, scott, gave, the, dog, driver, meares, the, following, written, orders, at, cape, evans, dated, 20, october, 1911, to, secure, scott, s, speedy, return, from, the, pole, using, dogs, about, the, first, week, of, february, i, should, like, you, to, start, your, third, journey, to, the, south, the, object, being, to, hasten, the, return, of, the, third, southern, unit, and, give, it, a, chance, to, catch, the, ship, the, date, of, your, departure, must, depend, on, news, received, from, returning, units, the, extent, of, the, depot, of, dog, food, you, have, been, able, to, leave, at, one, ton, camp, the, state, of, the, dogs, etc, it, looks, at, present, as, though, you, should, aim, at, meeting, the, returning, party, about, march, 1, in, latitude, 82, or, 82, 30, the, march, south, began, on, 1, november, 1911, a, caravan, of, mixed, transport, groups, motors, dogs, horses, with, loaded, sledges, travelling, at, different, rates, all, designed, to, support, a, final, group, of, four, men, who, would, make, a, dash, for, the, pole, the, southbound, party, steadily, reduced, in, size, as, successive, support, teams, turned, back, scott, reminded, the, returning, surgeon, lieutenant, atkinson, of, the, order, to, take, the, two, dog, teams, south, in, the, event, of, meares, having, to, return, home, as, seemed, likely, by, 4, january, 1912, the, last, two, four, man, groups, had, reached, 87, 34, s, scott, announced, his, decision, five, men, himself, wilson, bowers, oates, and, e, evans, would, go, forward, the, other, three, teddy, evans, william, lashly, and, tom, crean, would, return, the, chosen, group, marched, on, reaching, the, pole, on, 17, january, only, to, find, a, tent, left, in, place, by, amundsen, in, it, containing, a, letter, dated, 18, december, scott, s, anguish, is, indicated, in, his, diary, the, worst, has, happened, all, the, day, dreams, must, go, great, god, this, is, an, awful, place, the, deflated, party, began, the, 862, miles, 1, 387, km, return, journey, on, 19, january, i, m, afraid, the, return, journey, is, going, to, be, dreadfully, tiring, and, monotonous, wrote, scott, on, that, day, the, party, made, good, progress, despite, poor, weather, and, had, completed, the, polar, plateau, stage, of, their, journey, approximately, 300, miles, 480, km, by, 7, february, in, the, following, days, as, the, party, made, the, 100, miles, 160, km, descent, of, the, beardmore, glacier, the, physical, condition, of, edgar, evans, which, scott, had, noted, with, concern, as, early, as, 23, january, declined, sharply, a, fall, on, 4, february, had, left, evans, dull, and, incapable, and, on, 17, february, after, another, fall, he, died, near, the, glacier, foot, still, needing, to, travel, 400, miles, 640, km, across, the, ross, ice, shelf, the, prospects, of, scott, s, party, steadily, worsened, as, they, struggled, northward, with, deteriorating, weather, a, puzzling, lack, of, fuel, in, the, depots, hunger, and, exhaustion, meanwhile, back, at, cape, evans, the, terra, nova, arrived, at, the, beginning, of, february, and, atkinson, decided, to, unload, the, supplies, from, the, ship, with, his, own, men, rather, than, set, out, south, with, the, dogs, to, meet, scott, as, ordered, when, atkinson, finally, did, leave, south, for, the, planned, rendezvous, with, scott, he, encountered, the, scurvy, ridden, edward, teddy, evans, who, needed, urgent, medical, attention, atkinson, therefore, tried, to, send, the, experienced, navigator, wright, south, to, meet, scott, but, chief, meteorologist, simpson, declared, he, needed, wright, for, scientific, work, atkinson, then, decided, to, send, the, short, sighted, cherry, garrard, on, 25, february, who, was, not, able, to, navigate, only, as, far, as, one, ton, depot, which, is, within, sight, of, mount, erebus, effectively, cancelling, scott, s, orders, for, meeting, him, at, latitude, 82, or, 82, 30, on, 1, march, on, the, return, journey, from, the, pole, scott, reached, the, 82, s, meeting, point, for, the, dog, teams, 300, miles, 480, km, from, hut, point, three, days, ahead, of, schedule, noting, in, his, diary, for, 27, february, 1912, we, are, naturally, always, discussing, possibility, of, meeting, dogs, where, and, when, etc, it, is, a, critical, position, we, may, find, ourselves, in, safety, at, the, next, depot, but, there, is, a, horrid, element, of, doubt, on, 2, march, oates, began, to, suffer, from, the, effects, of, frostbite, and, the, party, s, progress, slowed, as, he, was, increasingly, unable, to, assist, in, the, workload, eventually, only, able, to, drag, himself, alongside, the, men, pulling, the, sledge, by, 10, march, the, temperature, had, dropped, unexpectedly, to, below, 40, c, 40, f, in, a, farewell, letter, to, sir, edgar, speyer, dated, 16, march, scott, wondered, whether, he, had, overshot, the, meeting, point, and, fought, the, growing, suspicion, that, he, had, in, fact, been, abandoned, by, the, dog, teams, we, very, nearly, came, through, and, it, s, a, pity, to, have, missed, it, but, lately, i, have, felt, that, we, have, overshot, our, mark, no, one, is, to, blame, and, i, hope, no, attempt, will, be, made, to, suggest, that, we, had, lacked, support, on, the, same, day, oates, whose, toes, had, become, frostbitten, voluntarily, left, the, tent, and, walked, to, his, death, scott, wrote, that, oates, last, words, were, i, am, just, going, outside, and, may, be, some, time, after, walking, 20, miles, 32, km, farther, despite, scott, s, toes, now, becoming, frostbitten, the, three, remaining, men, made, their, final, camp, on, 19, march, approximately, 12, 5, miles, 20, 1, km, short, of, one, ton, depot, the, next, day, a, fierce, blizzard, prevented, their, making, any, progress, during, the, next, nine, days, as, their, supplies, ran, out, and, with, storms, still, raging, outside, the, tent, scott, and, his, companions, wrote, their, farewell, letters, scott, gave, up, his, diary, after, 23, march, save, for, a, final, entry, on, 29, march, with, its, concluding, words, last, entry, for, god, s, sake, look, after, our, people, he, left, letters, to, wilson, s, mother, bowers, mother, a, string, of, notables, including, his, former, commander, sir, george, egerton, his, own, mother, and, his, wife, he, also, wrote, his, message, to, the, public, primarily, a, vindication, of, the, expedition, s, organisation, and, conduct, in, which, the, party, s, failure, is, attributed, to, weather, and, other, misfortunes, but, ending, on, an, inspirational, note, with, these, words, we, took, risks, we, knew, we, took, them, things, have, come, out, against, us, and, therefore, we, have, no, cause, for, complaint, but, bow, to, the, will, of, providence, determined, still, to, do, our, best, to, the, last, had, we, lived, i, should, have, had, a, tale, to, tell, of, the, hardihood, endurance, and, courage, of, my, companions, which, would, have, stirred, the, heart, of, every, englishman, these, rough, notes, and, our, dead, bodies, must, tell, the, tale, but, surely, surely, a, great, rich, country, like, ours, will, see, that, those, who, are, dependent, on, us, are, properly, provided, for, scott, is, presumed, to, have, died, on, 29, march, 1912, or, possibly, one, day, later, the, positions, of, the, bodies, in, the, tent, when, it, was, discovered, eight, months, later, suggested, that, scott, was, the, last, of, the, three, to, die, in, his, final, journal, entry, he, wrote, i, do, not, think, we, can, hope, for, any, better, things, now, we, shall, stick, it, out, to, the, end, but, we, are, getting, weaker, of, course, and, the, end, cannot, be, far, it, seems, a, pity, but, i, do, not, think, i, can, write, more, r, scott, for, god, s, sake, look, after, our, people, the, bodies, of, scott, and, his, companions, were, discovered, by, a, search, party, on, 12, november, 1912, tryggve, gran, who, was, part, of, the, search, party, described, the, scene, as, snowcovered, til, up, above, the, door, with, scott, in, the, middle, half, out, of, his, bagg, the, frost, had, made, the, skin, yellow, transparent, i, ve, never, seen, anything, worse, in, my, life, their, final, camp, became, their, tomb, their, records, and, personal, belongings, were, retrieved, before, the, tent, roof, was, lowered, over, the, bodies, and, a, high, cairn, of, snow, was, erected, over, it, topped, by, a, roughly, fashioned, cross, erected, using, gran, s, skis, next, to, their, bodies, lay, 35, pounds, 16, kg, of, glossopteris, tree, fossils, which, they, had, dragged, on, hand, sledges, these, were, the, first, ever, discovered, antarctic, fossils, and, proved, that, antarctica, had, once, been, warm, and, connected, to, other, continents, in, january, 1913, before, terra, nova, left, for, home, a, large, wooden, cross, was, made, by, the, ship, s, carpenters, inscribed, with, the, names, of, the, lost, party, and, tennyson,

article, in, the, times, reporting, on, the, glowing, tributes, paid, to, scott, in, the, new, york, press, claimed, that, both, amundsen, and, shackleton, were, to, hear, that, such, a, disaster, could, overtake, a, well, organized, expedition, on, learning, the, details, of, scott, s, death, amundsen, is, reported, to, have, said, i, would, gladly, forgo, any, honour, or, money, if, thereby, i, could, have, saved, scott, his, terrible, death, scott, was, the, better, wordsmith, of, the, two, and, the, story, that, spread, throughout, the, world, was, largely, that, told, by, him, with, amundsen, s, victory, reduced, in, the, eyes, of, many, to, an, unsporting, stratagem, the, response, to, scott, s, final, plea, on, behalf, of, the, dependents, of, the, dead, was, enormous, by, the, standards, of, the, day, the, mansion, house, scott, memorial, fund, closed, at, 75, 000, equivalent, to, 9, 379, 000, in, 2023, this, was, not, equally, distributed, scott, s, widow, son, mother,

tragedy, more, than, 30, monuments, and, memorials, were, set, up, in, britain, alone, including, the, foundation, of, the, scott, polar, research, institute, at, cambridge, many, more, were, established, in, other, parts, of, the, world, including, a, statue, sculpted, by, scott, s, widow, for, his, new, zealand, base, in, christchurch, a, number, of, institutions, have, relics, and,

period, after, world, war, ii, beyond, the, 50th, anniversary, of, his, death, in, 1948, the, film, scott, of, the, antarctic, was, released, in, cinemas, and, was, the, third, most, popular, film, in, britain, the, following, year, it, portrays, the, team, spirit, of, the, expedition, and, the, harsh, antarctic, environment, but, also, includes, critical, scenes, such, as, scott, regarding, his, broken, down, motors, and, ruefully, remembering, nansen, s, advice, to, take, only, dogs, evans, and, cherry, garrard, were, the, only, surviving, expedition, members, to, refuse, participation, in, the, film, but, both, re, published, their, respective, books, in, its, wake, in, 1966, reginald, pound, the, first, biographer, given, access, to, scott, s, original, sledging, journal, revealed, personal, failings, which, cast, a, new, light, on, scott, although, pound, continued, to, endorse, his, heroism, writing, of, a, splendid, sanity, that, would, not, be, subdued, another, book, critical, of, scott, david, thomson, s, scott, s, men, was, released, in, 1977, in, thomson, s, view, scott, was, not, a, great, man, at, least, not, until, near, the, end, his, planning, is, described, as, haphazard, and, flawed, his, leadership, characterised, by, lack, of, foresight, thus, by, the, late, 1970s, biographer, max, jones, stated, scott, s, complex, personality, had, been, revealed, and, his, methods, questioned, in, 1979, came, the, first, extreme, attack, on, scott, from, roland, huntford, s, dual, biography, scott, and, amundsen, in, which, scott, is, depicted, as, a, heroic, bungler, huntford, s, thesis, had, an, immediate, impact, becoming, the, contemporary, orthodoxy, after, huntford, s, book, several, other, mostly, negative, books, about, captain, scott, were, published, francis, spufford, in, a, 1996, history, not, wholly, antagonistic, to, scott, refers, to, devastating, evidence, of, bungling, concluding, that, scott, doomed, his, companions, then, covered, his, tracks, with, rhetoric, travel, writer, paul, theroux, summarised, scott, as, confused, and, demoralised, an, enigma, to, his, men, unprepared, and, a, bungler, this, decline, in, scott, s, reputation, was, accompanied, by, a, corresponding, rise, in, that, of, his, erstwhile, rival, shackleton, at, first, in, the, united, states, but, eventually, in, britain, as, well, a, 2002, nationwide, poll, in, the, united, kingdom, to, discover, the, 100, greatest, britons, showed, shackleton, in, eleventh, place, scott, well, down, the, list, at, 54th, the, 21st, century, has, seen, a, shift, of, opinion, in, scott, s, favour, in, what, cultural, historian, stephanie, barczewski, calls, a, revision, of, the, revisionist, view, meteorologist, susan, solomon, s, 2001, account, the, coldest, march, ties, the, fate, of, scott, s, party, to, the, extraordinarily, adverse, barrier, weather, conditions, of, february, and, march, 1912, rather, than, to, personal, or, organisational, failings, and, while, not, entirely, questioning, any, criticism, of, scott, solomon, principally, characterises, the, criticism, as, the, myth, of, scott, as, a, bungler, in, 2005, david, crane, published, a, new, scott, biography, in, which, he, comes, to, the, conclusion, that, scott, is, possibly, the, only, figure, in, polar, history, except, lawrence, oates, so, wholly, obscured, by, legend, according, to, barczewski, he, goes, some, way, towards, an, assessment, of, scott, free, from, the, baggage, of, earlier, interpretations, what, has, happened, to, scott, s, reputation, crane, argues, derives, from, the, way, the, world, has, changed, since, the, hopeless, heroism, and, obscene, waste, of, the, first, world, war, at, the, time, of, scott, s, death, people, clutched, at, the, proof, he, gave, that, the, qualities, that, made, britain, indeed, the, british, empire, great, were, not, extinct, future, generations, mindful, of, the, carnage, that, started, 2, 1, 2, years, later, the, ideals, of, unquestionable, duty, self, sacrifice, discipline, patriotism, and, hierarchy, associated, with, his, tragedy, take, on, a, different, and, more, sinister, colouring, crane, s, main, achievement, according, to, barczewski, is, the, restoration, of, scott, s, humanity, far, more, effectively, than, either, fiennes, s, stridency, or, solomon, s, scientific, data, daily, telegraph, columnist, jasper, rees, likening, the, changes, in, explorers, reputations, to, climatic, variations, suggests, that, in, the, current, antarctic, weather, report, scott, is, enjoying, his, first, spell, in, the, sun, for, twenty, five, years, the, new, york, times, book, review, was, more, critical, pointing, out, crane, s, support, for, scott, s, account, regarding, the, circumstances, of, the, freeing, of, the, discovery, from, the, pack, ice, and, concluded, that, for, all, the, many, attractions, of, his, book, david, crane, offers, no, answers, that, convincingly, exonerate, scott, from, a, significant, share, of, responsibility, for, his, own, demise, in, 2012, karen, may, published, her, discovery, that, scott, had, issued, written, orders, before, his, march, to, the, pole, for, meares, to, meet, the, returning, party, with, dog, teams, in, contrast, to, huntford, s, assertion, in, 1979, that, scott, issued, those, vital, instructions, only, as, a, casual, oral, order, to, evans, during, the, march, to, the, pole, according, to, may, huntford, s, scenario, was, pure, invention, based, on, an, error, it, has, led, a, number, of, polar, historians, down, a, regrettable, false, trail, the, expedition, was, the, subject, of, terra, nova, a, 1977, play, by, ted, tally, who, later, wrote, the, screenplay, for, the, silence, of, the, lambs, beryl, bainbridge, s, 1991, novel, the, birthday, boys, also, gives, a, fictionalised, account, of, the, expedition, with, monologues, from, the, five, men, who, died, on, the, return, from,
