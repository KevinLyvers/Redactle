reich, he, continued, to, deny, explicit, knowledge, of, and, responsibility, for, the, holocaust, this, image, dominated, his, historiography, in, the, decades, following, the, war, giving, rise, to, the, speer, myth, the, perception, of, him, as, an, apolitical, technocrat, responsible, for, revolutionizing, the, german, war, machine, the, myth, began, to, fall, apart, in, the, 1980s, when, the, armaments, miracle, was, attributed, to, nazi, propaganda, a, quarter, century, after, speer, s, death, adam, tooze, wrote, in, the, wages, of, destruction, that, the, idea, that, speer, was, an,

courting, margarete, margret, weber, 1905, 1987, the, daughter, of, a, successful, craftsman, who, employed, 50, workers, the, relationship, was, frowned, upon, by, speer, s, class, conscious, mother, who, felt, the, webers, were, socially, inferior, despite, this, opposition, the, two, married, in, berlin, on, 28, august, 1928, seven, years, elapsed, before, margarete, was, invited, to, stay, at, her, in, laws, home, the, couple, would, have, six, children, together, but, albert, speer, grew, increasingly, distant, from, his, family, after, 1933, he, remained, so, even, after, his, release,

s, berlin, headquarters, when, the, commission, was, completed, speer, returned, to, mannheim, and, remained, there, as, hitler, took, office, in, january, 1933, the, organizers, of, the, 1933, nuremberg, rally, asked, speer, to, submit, designs, for, the, rally, bringing, him, into, contact, with, hitler, for, the, first, time, neither, the, organizers, nor, rudolf, hess, were, willing, to, decide, whether, to, approve, the, plans, and, hess, sent, speer, to, hitler, s, munich, apartment, to, seek, his, approval, this, work, won, speer, his, first, national, post, as, nazi, party, commissioner, for, the, artistic, and, technical, presentation, of, party, rallies, and, demonstrations, shortly, after, hitler, came, into, power, he, began, to, make, plans, to, rebuild, the, chancellery, at, the, end, of, 1933, he, contracted, paul, troost, to, renovate, the, entire, building, hitler, appointed, speer, whose, work, for, goebbels, had, impressed, him, to, manage, the, building, site, for, troost, as, chancellor, hitler, had, a, residence, in, the, building, and, came, by, every, day, to, be, briefed, by, speer, and, the, building, supervisor, on, the, progress, of, the, renovations, after, one, of, these, briefings, hitler, invited, speer, to, lunch, to, the, architect, s, great, excitement, speer, quickly, became, part, of, hitler, s, inner, circle, he, was, expected, to, call, on, him, in, the, morning, for, a, walk, or, chat, to, provide, consultation, on, architectural, matters, and, to, discuss, hitler, s, ideas, most, days, he, was, invited, to, dinner, in, the, english, version, of, his, memoirs, speer, says, that, his, political, commitment, merely, consisted, of, paying, his, monthly, dues, he, assumed, his, german, readers, would, not, be, so, gullible, and, told, them, the, nazi, party, offered, a, new, mission, he, was, more, forthright, in, an, interview, with, william, hamsher, in, which, he, said, he, joined, the, party, in, order, to, save, germany, from, communism, after, the, war, he, claimed, to, have, had, little, interest, in, politics, at, all, and, had, joined, almost, by, chance, like, many, of, those, in, power, in, the, third, reich, he, was, not, an, ideologue, nor, was, he, anything, more, than, an, instinctive, anti, semite, the, historian, magnus, brechtken, discussing, speer, said, he, did, not, give, anti, jewish, public, speeches, and, that, his, anti, semitism, can, best, be, understood, through, his, actions, which, were, anti, semitic, brechtken, added, that, throughout, speer, s, life, his, central, motives, were, to, gain, power, rule, and, acquire, wealth, when, troost, died, on, 21, january, 1934, speer, effectively, replaced, him, as, the, party, s, chief, architect, hitler, appointed, speer, as, head, of, the, chief, office, for, construction, which, placed, him, nominally, on, hess, s, staff, one, of, speer, s, first, commissions, after, troost, s, death, was, the,

to, hold, 340, 000, people, speer, insisted, that, as, many, events, as, possible, be, held, at, night, both, to, give, greater, prominence, to, his, lighting, effects, and, to, hide, the, overweight, nazis, nuremberg, was, the, site, of, many, official, nazi, buildings, many, more, buildings, were, planned, if, built, the, german, stadium, in, nuremberg, would, have, accommodated, 400, 000, spectators, speer, modified, werner, march, s, design, for, the, olympic, stadium, being, built, for, the, 1936, summer, olympics, he, added, a, stone, exterior, that, pleased, hitler, speer,

ii, in, 1939, led, to, the, postponement, and, later, the, abandonment, of, these, plans, which, after, nazi, capitulation, speer, himself, considered, as, awful, plans, to, build, a, new, reich, chancellery, had, been, underway, since, 1934, land, had, been, purchased, by, the, end, of, 1934, and, starting, in, march, 1936, the, first, buildings, were, demolished, to, create, space, at, vo,

year, shortages, of, labor, meant, the, construction, workers, had, to, work, in, ten, to, twelve, hour, shifts, the, ss, built, two, concentration, camps, in, 1938, and, used, the, inmates, to, quarry, stone, for, its, construction, a, brick, factory, was, built, near, the, oranienburg, concentration, camp, at, speer, s, behest, when, someone, commented, on, the, poor, conditions, there, speer, stated, the, yids, got, used, to, making, bricks, while, in, egyptian, captivity, the, chancellery, was, completed, in, early, january, 1939, the, building, itself, was, hailed, by, hitler, as, the, crowning, glory, of, the, greater, german, political, empire, during, the, chancellery, project, the, pogrom, of, kristallnacht, took, place, speer, made, no, mention, of, it, in, the, first, draft, of, inside, the, third, reich, it, was, only, on, the, urgent, advice, of, his, publisher, that, he, added, a, mention, of, seeing, the, ruins, of, the, central, synagogue, in, berlin, from, his, car, kristallnacht, accelerated, speer, s, ongoing, efforts, to, dispossess, berlin, s, jews, from, their, homes, from, 1939, on, speer, s, department, used, the, nuremberg, laws, to, evict, jewish, tenants, of, non, jewish, landlords, in, berlin, to, make, way, for, non, jewish, tenants, displaced, by, redevelopment, or, bombing, eventually, 75, 000, jews, were, displaced, by, these, measures, speer, denied, he, knew, they, were, being, put, on, holocaust, trains, and, claimed, that, those, displaced, were, completely, free, and, their, families, were, still, in, their, apartments, he, also, said, en, route, to, my, ministry, on, the, city, highway, i, could, see, crowds, of, people, on, the, platform, of, nearby, nikolassee, railroad, station, i, knew, that, these, must, be, berlin, jews, who, were, being, evacuated, i, am, sure, that, an, oppressive, feeling, struck, me, as, i, drove, past, i, presumably, had, a, sense, of, somber, events, matthias, schmidt, said, speer, had, personally, inspected, concentration, camps, and, described, his, comments, as, an, outright, farce, martin, kitchen, described, speer, s, often, repeated, line, that, he, knew, nothing, of, the, dreadful, things, as, hollow, not, only, was, he, fully, aware, of, the, fate, of, the, jews, he, actively, participated, in, their, persecution, as, germany, started, world, war, ii, in, europe, speer, instituted, quick, reaction, squads, to, construct, roads, or, clear, away, debris, before, long, these, units, would, be, used, to, clear, bomb, sites, speer, used, forced, jewish, labor, on, these, projects, in, addition, to, regular, german, workers, construction, stopped, on, the, berlin, and, n, remberg, plans, at, the, outbreak, of, war, though, stockpiling, of, materials, and, other, work, continued, this, slowed, to, a, halt, as, more, resources, were, needed, for, the, armament, industry, speer, s, offices, undertook, building, work, for, each, branch, of, the, military, and, for, the, ss, using, slave, labor, speer, s, building, work, made, him, among, the, wealthiest, of, the, nazi, elite, as, one, of, the, younger, and, more, ambitious, men, in, hitler, s, inner, circle, speer, was, approaching, the, height, of, his, power, in, 1938, prussian, minister, president, hermann, g, ring, had, appointed, him, to, the, prussian, state, council, in, 1941, he, was, elected, to, the, reichstag, from, electoral, constituency, 2, berlin, west, on, 8, february, 1942, reich, minister, of, armaments, and, munitions, fritz, todt, died, in, a, plane, crash, shortly, after, taking, off, from, hitler, s, eastern, headquarters, at, rastenburg, speer, arrived, there, the, previous, evening, and, accepted, todt, s, offer, to, fly, with, him, to, berlin, speer, cancelled, some, hours, before, take, off, because, the, previous, night, he, had, been, up, late, in, a, meeting, with, hitler, hitler, appointed, speer, in, todt, s, place, martin, kitchen, a, british, historian, says, that, the, choice, was, not, surprising, speer, was, loyal, to, hitler, and, his, experience, building, prisoner, of, war, camps, and, other, structures, for, the, military, qualified, him, for, the, job, speer, succeeded, todt, not, only, as, reich, minister, but, in, all, his, other, powerful, positions, including, inspector, general, of, german, roadways, inspector, general, for, water, and, energy, and, head, of, the, nazi, party, s, office, of, technology, at, the, same, time, hitler, also, appointed, speer, as, head, of, the, organisation, todt, a, massive, government, controlled, construction, company, characteristically, hitler, did, not, give, speer, any, clear, remit, he, was, left, to, fight, his, contemporaries, in, the, regime, for, power, and, control, as, an, example, he, wanted, to, be, given, power, over, all, armaments, issues, under, g, ring, s, four, year, plan, g, ring, was, reluctant, to, grant, this, however, speer, secured, hitler, s, support, and, on, 1, march, 1942, g, ring, signed, a, decree, naming, speer, general, plenipotentiary, for, armament, tasks, in, the, four, year, plan, speer, proved, to, be, ambitious, unrelenting, and, ruthless, speer, set, out, to, gain, control, not, just, of, armaments, production, in, the, army, but, in, the, whole, armed, forces, it, did, not, immediately, dawn, on, his, political, rivals, that, his, calls, for, rationalization, and, reorganization, were, hiding, his, desire, to, sideline, them, and, take, control, by, april, 1942, speer, had, persuaded, g, ring, to, create, a, three, member, central, planning, board, within, the, four, year, plan, which, he, used, to, obtain, supreme, authority, over, procurement, and, allocation, of, raw, materials, and, scheduling, of, production, in, order, to, consolidate, german, war, production, in, a, single, agency, speer, was, f, ted, at, the, time, and, in, the, post, war, era, for, performing, an, armaments, miracle, in, which, german, war, production, dramatically, increased, this, miracle, was, brought, to, a, halt, in, the, summer, of, 1943, by, among, other, factors, the, first, sustained, allied, bombing, other, factors, probably, contributed, to, the, increase, more, than, speer, himself, germany, s, armaments, production, had, already, begun, to, result, in, increases, under, his, predecessor, todt, naval, armaments, were, not, under, speer, s, supervision, until, october, 1943, nor, the, luftwaffe, s, armaments, until, june, of, the, following, year, yet, each, showed, comparable, increases, in, production, despite, not, being, under, speer, s, control, another, factor, that, produced, the, boom, in, ammunition, was, the, policy, of, allocating, more, coal, to, the, steel, industry, production, of, every, type, of, weapon, peaked, in, june, and, july, 1944, but, there, was, now, a, severe, shortage, of, fuel, after, august, 1944, oil, from, the, romanian, fields, was, no, longer, available, oil, production, became, so, low, that, any, possibility, of, offensive, action, became, impossible, and, weaponry, lay, idle, as, minister, of, armaments, speer, was, responsible, for, supplying, weapons, to, the, army, with, hitler, s, full, agreement, he, decided, to, prioritize, tank, production, and, he, was, given, unrivaled, power, to, ensure, success, hitler, was, closely, involved, with, the, design, of, the, tanks, but, kept, changing, his, mind, about, the, specifications, this, delayed, the, program, and, speer, was, unable, to, remedy, the, situation, in, consequence, despite, tank, production, having, the, highest, priority, relatively, little, of, the, armaments, budget, was, spent, on, it, this, led, to, a, significant, german, army, failure, at, the, battle, of, prokhorovka, a, major, turning, point, on, the, eastern, front, against, the, soviet, red, army, as, head, of, organisation, todt, speer, was, directly, involved, in, the, construction, and, alteration, of, concentration, camps, he, agreed, to, expand, auschwitz, and, some, other, camps, allocating, 13, 7, million, reichsmarks, for, the, work, to, be, carried, out, this, allowed, an, extra, 300, huts, to, be, built, at, auschwitz, increasing, the, total, human, capacity, to, 132, 000, included, in, the, building, works, was, material, to, build, gas, chambers, crematoria, and, morgues, the, ss, called, this, professor, speer, s, special, programme, speer, realized, that, with, six, million, workers, drafted, into, the, armed, forces, there, was, a, labor, shortage, in, the, war, economy, and, not, enough, workers, for, his, factories, in, response, hitler, appointed, fritz, sauckel, as, a, manpower, dictator, to, obtain, new, workers, speer, and, sauckel, cooperated, closely, to, meet, speer, s, labor, demands, hitler, gave, sauckel, a, free, hand, to, obtain, labor, something, that, delighted, speer, who, had, requested, 1, 000, 000, voluntary, laborers, to, meet, the, need, for, armament, workers, sauckel, had, whole, villages, in, france, holland, and, belgium, forcibly, rounded, up, and, shipped, to, speer, s, factories, sauckel, obtained, new, workers, often, using, the, most, brutal, methods, in, occupied, areas, of, the, soviet, union, that, had, been, subject, to, partisan, action, civilian, men, and, women, were, rounded, up, en, masse, and, sent, to, work, forcibly, in, germany, by, april, 1943, sauckel, had, supplied, 1, 568, 801, voluntary, laborers, forced, laborers, prisoners, of, war, and, concentration, camp, prisoners, to, speer, for, use, in, his, armaments, factories, it, was, for, the, maltreatment, of, these, people, that, speer, was, principally, convicted, at, the, nuremberg, trials, following, his, appointment, as, minister, of, armaments, speer, was, in, control, of, armaments, production, solely, for, the, army, he, coveted, control, of, the, production, of, armaments, for, the, luftwaffe, and, kriegsmarine, as, well, he, set, about, extending, his, power, and, influence, with, unexpected, ambition, his, close, relationship, with, hitler, provided, him, with, political, protection, and, he, was, able, to, outwit, and, outmaneuver, his, rivals, in, the, regime, hitler, s, cabinet, was, dismayed, at, his, tactics, but, regardless, he, was, able, to, accumulate, new, responsibilities, and, more, power, by, july, 1943, he, had, gained, control, of, armaments, production, for, the, luftwaffe, and, kriegsmarine, in, august, 1943, he, took, control, of, most, of, the, ministry, of, economics, to, become, in, admiral, d, nitz, s, words, europe, s, economic, dictator, his, formal, title, was, changed, on, 2, september, 1943, to, reich, minister, for, armaments, and, war, production, he, had, become, one, of, the, most, powerful, people, in, nazi, germany, speer, and, his, hand, picked, director, of, submarine, construction, otto, merker, believed, that, the, shipbuilding, industry, was, being, held, back, by, outdated, methods, and, revolutionary, new, approaches, imposed, by, outsiders, would, dramatically, improve, output, this, belief, proved, incorrect, and, speer, and, merker, s, attempt, to, build, the, kriegsmarine, s, new, generation, of, submarines, the, type, xxi, and, type, xxiii, as, prefabricated, sections, at, different, facilities, rather, than, at, single, dockyards, contributed, to, the, failure, of, this, strategically, important, program, the, designs, were, rushed, into, production, and, the, completed,

allied, big, week, a, series, of, bombing, raids, on, the, german, aircraft, factories, that, were, a, devastating, blow, to, aircraft, production, his, political, rivals, used, the, opportunity, to, undermine, his, authority, and, damage, his, reputation, with, hitler, he, lost, hitler, s, unconditional, support, and, began, to, lose, power, in, response, to, the, allied, big, week, adolf,

the, growth, however, consisted, in, large, part, of, models, that, were, becoming, obsolescent, and, proved, easy, prey, for, allied, aircraft, on, 1, august, 1944, speer, merged, the, fighter, staff, into, a, newly, formed, armament, staff, committee, the, fighter, staff, committee, was, instrumental, in, bringing, about, the, increased, exploitation, of, slave, labor, in, the, war, economy, the, ss, provided, 64, 000, prisoners, for, 20, separate, projects, from, various, concentration, camps, including, mittelbau, dora, prisoners, worked, for, junkers, messerschmitt, henschel,

the, rocket, program, it, began, in, 1932, but, had, not, supplied, any, weaponry, speer, enthusiastically, supported, the, program, and, in, march, 1942, made, an, order, for, a4, rockets, the, predecessor, of, the, world, s, first, ballistic, missile, the, v, 2, rocket, the, rockets, were, researched, at, a, facility, in, peenem, nde, along, with, the, v, 1, flying, bomb, the, v, 2, s, first, target, was, paris, on, 8, september, 1944, the, program, while, advanced, proved, to, be, an, impediment, to, the, war, economy, the, large, capital, investment, was, not, repaid, in, military, effectiveness, the, rockets, were, built, at, an, underground, factory, at, mittelwerk, labor, to, build, the, a4, rockets, came, from, the, mittelbau, dora, concentration, camp, of, the,

control, over, berlin, after, hitler, survived, after, the, plot, speer, s, rivals, attacked, some, of, his, closest, allies, and, his, management, system, fell, out, of, favor, with, radicals, in, the, party, he, lost, yet, more, authority, losses, of, territory, and, a, dramatic, expansion, of, the, allied, strategic, bombing, campaign, caused, the, collapse, of, the, german, economy, from, late, 1944, air, attacks, on, the, transport, network, were, particularly, effective, as, they, cut, the, main, centres, of, production, off, from, essential, coal, supplies, in, january, 1945, speer, told, goebbels, that, armaments, production, could, be, sustained, for, at, least, a, year, however, he, concluded, that, the, war, was, lost, after, soviet, forces, captured, the, important, silesian, industrial, region, later, that, month, nevertheless, speer, believed, that, germany, should, continue, the, war, for, as, long, as, possible, with, the, goal, of, winning, better, conditions, from, the, allies, than, the, unconditional, surrender, they, insisted, upon, during, january, and, february, speer, claimed, that, his, ministry, would, deliver, decisive, weapons, and, a, large, increase, in, armaments, production, which, would, bring, about, a, dramatic, change, on, the, battlefield, speer, gained, control, over, the, railways, in, february, and, asked, heinrich, himmler, to, supply, concentration, camp, prisoners, to, work, on, their, repair, by, mid, march, speer, had, accepted, that, germany, s, economy, would, collapse, within, the, next, eight, weeks, while, he, sought, to, frustrate, directives, to, destroy, industrial, facilities, in, areas, at, risk, of, capture, so, that, they, could, be, used, after, the, war, he, still, supported, the, war, s, continuation, speer, provided, hitler, with, a, memorandum, on, 15, march, which, detailed, germany, s, dire, economic, situation, and, sought, approval, to, cease, demolitions, of, infrastructure, three, days, later, he, also, proposed, to, hitler, that, germany, s, remaining, military, resources, be, concentrated, along, the, rhine, and, vistula, rivers, in, an, attempt, to, prolong, the, fighting, this, ignored, military, realities, as, the, german, armed, forces, were, unable, to, match, the, allies, firepower, and, were, facing, total, defeat, hitler, rejected, speer, s, proposal, to, cease, demolitions, instead, he, issued, the, nero, decree, on, 19, march, which, called, for, the, destruction, of, all, infrastructure, as, the, army, retreated, speer, was, appalled, by, this, order, and, persuaded, several, key, military, and, political, leaders, to, ignore, it, during, a, meeting, with, speer, on, 28, 29, march, hitler, rescinded, the, decree, and, gave, him, authority, over, demolitions, speer, ended, them, though, the, army, continued, to, blow, up, bridges, by, april, little, was, left, of, the, armaments, industry, and, speer, had, few, official, duties, speer, visited, the, f, hrerbunker, on, 22, april, for, the, last, time, he, met, hitler, and, toured, the, damaged, chancellery, before, leaving, berlin, to, return, to, hamburg, speer, would, later, claim, in, his, memoirs, that, during, this, visit, he, confessed, to, hitler, that, he, was, disobeying, his, scorched, earth, policy, an, assertion, which, has, been, described, as, pure, invention, by, historian, richard, j, evans, on, 29, april, the, day, before, committing, suicide, hitler, dictated, a, final, political, testament, which, dropped, speer, from, the, successor, government, speer, was, to, be, replaced, by, his, subordinate, karl, otto, saur, speer, was, disappointed, that, hitler, had, not, selected, him, as, his, successor, after, hitler, s, death, speer, offered, his,

s, supreme, court, said, speer, joined, in, planning, and, executing, the, program, to, dragoon, prisoners, of, war, and, foreign, workers, into, german, war, industries, which, waxed, in, output, while, the, workers, waned, in, starvation, speer, s, attorney, hans, fl, chsner, successfully, contrasted, speer, from, other, defendants, and, portrayed, him, as, an, artist, thrust, into,

architects, and, industrialists, who, had, benefited, from, speer, s, activities, during, the, war, initially, the, funds, were, used, only, to, support, speer, s, family, but, increasingly, the, money, was, used, for, other, purposes, they, paid, for, toni, proost, to, go, on, holiday, and, for, bribes, to, those, who, might, be, able, to, secure, speer, s, release, once, speer, became, aware, of, the, existence, of, the, fund, he, sent, detailed, instructions, about, what, to, do, with, the, money, wolters, raised, a, total, of, dm, 158, 000, for, speer, over, the, final, seventeen,

pages, he, had, completed, his, memoirs, by, november, 1953, and, they, became, the, basis, of, inside, the, third, reich, in, spandau, diaries, speer, aimed, to, present, himself, as, a, tragic, hero, who, had, made, a, faustian, bargain, for, which, he, endured, a, harsh, prison, sentence, much, of, speer, s, energy, was, dedicated, to, keeping, fit, both, physically, and, mentally, during,

october, 1966, speer, s, release, from, prison, was, a, worldwide, media, event, reporters, and, photographers, crowded, both, the, street, outside, spandau, and, the, lobby, of, the, hotel, berlin, where, speer, spent, the, night, he, said, little, reserving, most, comments, for, a, major, interview, published, in, der, spiegel, in, november, 1966, although, he, stated, he, hoped, to, resume, an, architectural, career, his, sole, project, a, collaboration, for, a, brewery, was, unsuccessful, instead, he, revised, his, spandau, writings, into, two, autobiographical, books, inside, the, third, reich, in, german, erinnerungen, or, reminiscences, and, spandau, the, secret, diaries, he, later, published, a, work, about, himmler, and, the, ss, which, has, been, published, in, english, as, the, slave, state, heinrich, himmler, s, masterplan, for, ss, supremacy, or, infiltration, how, heinrich, himmler, schemed, to, build, an, ss, industrial, empire, in, german, der, sklavenstaat, meine, auseinandersetzung, mit, der, ss, speer, was, aided, in, shaping, the, works, by, joachim, fest, and, wolf, jobst, siedler, from, the, publishing, house, ullstein, he, found, himself, unable, to, re, establish, a, relationship, with, his, children, even, with, his, son, albert, who, had, also, become, an, architect, according, to, speer, s, daughter, hilde, schramm, one, by, one, my, sister, and, brothers, gave, up, there, was, no, communication, he, supported, hermann, his, brother, financially, after, the, war, however, his, other, brother, ernst, had, died, in, the, battle, of, stalingrad, despite, repeated, requests, from, his, parents, for, speer, to, repatriate, him, following, his, release, from, spandau, speer, donated, the, chronicle, his, personal, diary, to, the, german, federal, archives, it, had, been, edited, by, wolters, and, made, no, mention, of, the, jews, david, irving, discovered, discrepancies, between, the, deceptively, edited, chronicle, and, independent, documents, speer, asked, wolters, to, destroy, the, material, he, had, omitted, from, his, donation, but, wolters, refused, and, retained, an, original, copy, wolters, friendship, with, speer, deteriorated, and, one, year, before, speer, s, death, wolters, gave, matthias, schmidt, access, to, the, unedited, chronicle, schmidt, authored, the, first, book, highly, critical, of, speer, speer, s, memoirs, were, a, phenomenal, success, the, public, was, fascinated, by, an, inside, view, of, the, third, reich, and, a, major, war, criminal, became, a, popular, figure, almost, overnight, importantly, he, provided, an, alibi, to, older, germans, who, had, been, nazis, if, speer, who, had, been, so, close, to, hitler, had, not, known, the, full, extent, of, the, crimes, of, the, nazi, regime, and, had, just, been, following, orders, then, they, could, tell, themselves, and, others, they, too, had, done, the, same, so, great, was, the, need, to, believe, this, speer, myth, that, fest, and, siedler, were, able, to, strengthen, it, even, in, the, face, of, mounting, historical, evidence, to, the, contrary, speer, made, himself, widely, available, to, historians, and, other, enquirers, in, october, 1973, he, made, his, first, trip, to, britain, flying, to, london, to, be, interviewed, on, the, bbc, midweek, programme, in, the, same, year, he, appeared, on, the, television, programme, the, world, at, war, speer, returned, to, london, in, 1981, to, participate, in, the, bbc, newsnight, programme, he, suffered, a, stroke, and, died, in, london, on, 1, september, he, had, remained, married, to, his, wife, but, he, had, formed, a, relationship, with, a, german, woman, living, in, london, and, was, with, her, at, the, time, of, his, death, his, daughter, margret, nissen, wrote, in, her, 2005, memoirs, that, after, his, release, from, spandau, he, spent, all, of, his, time, constructing, the, speer, myth, after, his, release, from, spandau, speer, portrayed, himself, as, the, good, nazi, he, was, well, educated, middle, class, and, bourgeois, and, could, contrast, himself, with, those, who, in, the, popular, mind, typified, bad, nazis, in, his, memoirs, and, interviews, he, had, distorted, the, truth, and, made, so, many, major, omissions, that, his, lies, became, known, as, myths, speer, even, invented, his, own, birth, s, circumstances, stating, falsely, that, he, was, born, at, midday, amid, crashes, of, thunder, and, bells, of, the, nearby, christ, church, whereas, it, was, between, three, and, five, o, clock, and, the, church, was, built, only, some, years, after, speer, took, his, myth, making, to, a, mass, media, level, and, his, cunning, apologies, were, reproduced, frequently, in, post, war, germany, isabell, trommer, writes, in, her, biography, of, speer, that, fest, and, siedler, were, co, authors, of, speer, s, memoirs, and, co, creators, of, his, myths, in, return, they, were, paid, handsomely, in, royalties, and, other, financial, inducements, speer, siedler, and, fest, had, constructed, a, masterpiece, the, image, of, the, good, nazi, remained, in, place, for, decades, despite, historical, evidence, indicating, that, it, was, false, speer, had, carefully, constructed, an, image, of, himself, as, an, apolitical, technocrat, who, deeply, regretted, having, failed, to, discover, the, monstrous, crimes, of, the, third, reich, this, construction, was, accepted, almost, at, face, value, by, historian, hugh, trevor, roper, when, investigating, the, death, of, adolf, hitler, for, british, intelligence, and, in, writing, the, last, days, of, hitler, trevor, roper, frequently, refers, to, speer, as, a, technocrat, nourished, a, technocrat, s, philosophy, one, who, cared, only, for, his, building, projects, or, his, ministerial, duties, and, who, thought, that, politics, was, irrelevant, at, least, until, hitler, s, nero, decree, which, speer, according, to, his, own, telling, worked, assiduously, to, counter, trevor, roper, who, calls, speer, an, administrative, genius, whose, basic, instincts, were, peaceful, and, constructive, does, take, speer, to, task, however, for, his, failure, to, recognize, the, immorality, of, hitler, and, nazism, calling, him, the, real, criminal, of, nazi, germany, for, ten, years, he, sat, at, the, very, centre, of, political, power, his, keen, intelligence, diagnosed, the, nature, and, observed, the, mutations, of, nazi, government, and, policy, he, saw, and, despised, the, personalities, around, him, he, heard, their, outrageous, orders, and, understood, their, fantastic, ambitions, but, he, did, nothing, supposing, politics, to, be, irrelevant, he, turned, aside, and, built, roads, and, bridges, and, factories, while, the, logical, consequences, of, government, by, madmen, emerged, ultimately, when, their, emergence, involved, the, ruin, of, all, his, work, speer, accepted, the, consequences, and, acted, then, it, was, too, late, germany, had, been, destroyed, after, speer, s, death, matthias, schmidt, published, a, book, that, demonstrated, that, speer, had, ordered, the, eviction, of, jews, from, their, berlin, homes, by, 1999, historians, had, amply, demonstrated, that, speer, had, lied, extensively, even, so, public, perceptions, of, speer, did, not, change, substantially, until, heinrich, breloer, aired, the, biographical, film, speer, und, er, on, television, in, 2004, the, film, began, a, process, of, demystification, and, critical, reappraisal, of, speer, adam, tooze, in, his, book, the, wages, of, destruction, said, speer, had, manoeuvred, himself, through, the, ranks, of, the, regime, skillfully, and, ruthlessly, and, that, the, idea, he, was, a, technocrat, blindly, carrying, out, orders, was, absurd, trommer, said, speer, was, not, an, apolitical, technocrat, instead, he, was, in, reality, one, of, the, most, powerful, and, unscrupulous, leaders, in, the, entire, nazi, regime, kitchen, said, speer, had, deceived, the, nuremberg, tribunal, and, post, war, germany, brechtken, said, that, if, speer, s, extensive, involvement, in, the, holocaust, had, been, known, at, the, time, of, his, trial, he, would, have, been, sentenced, to, death, the, image, of, the, good, nazi, was, supported, by, numerous, speer, myths, in, addition, to, the, myth, that, he, was, an, apolitical, technocrat, he, claimed, he, did, not, have, full, knowledge, of, the, holocaust, or, the, persecution, of, the, jews, another, myth, posits, that, speer, revolutionized, the, german, war, machine, after, his, appointment, as, minister, of, armaments, he, was, credited, with, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, shipment, of, arms, that, was, widely, reported, as, keeping, germany, in, the, war, another, myth, centered, around, a, nonexistent, plan, to, assassinate, hitler, with, poisonous, gas, the, idea, for, this, myth, came, to, him, after, he, recalled, the, panic, when, car, fumes, came, through, an, air, ventilation, system, he, fabricated, the, additional, details, brechtken, wrote, that, speer, s, most, brazen, lie, was, fabricated, during, an, interview, with, a, french, journalist, in, 1952, the, journalist, described, an, invented, scenario, in, which, speer, had, refused, hitler, s, orders, and, hitler, had, left, with, tears, in, his, eyes, speer, liked, the, scenario, so, much, that, he, included, it, in, his, memoirs, the, journalist, had, unwittingly, collaborated, in, creating, one, of, his, myths, speer, also, sought, to, portray, himself, as, an, opponent, of, hitler, s, leadership, despite, his, opposition, to, the, 20, july, plot, he, falsely, claimed, in, his, memoirs, to, have, been, sympathetic, to, the, plotters, he, maintained, hitler, was, cool, towards, him, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, after, learning, they, had, included, him, on, a, list, of, potential, ministers, this, formed, a, key, element, of, the, myths, speer, encouraged, speer, also, falsely, claimed, that, he, had, realised, the, war, was, lost, at, an, early, stage, and, thereafter, worked, to, preserve, the, resources, needed, for, the, civilian, population, s, survival, in, reality, speer, had, sought, to, prolong, the, war, until, further, resistance, was, impossible, thus, contributing, to, the, large, number, of, deaths, and, the, extensive, destruction, germany, suffered, during, the, final, months, of, the, war, speer, maintained, at, the, nuremberg, trials, and, in, his, memoirs, that, he, had, no, direct, knowledge, of, the, holocaust, he, admitted, only, to, being, uncomfortable, around, jews, in, the, published, version, of, the, spandau, diaries, in, his, final, statement, at, nuremberg, speer, gave, the, impression, of, apologizing, although, he, did, not, directly, admit, any, personal, guilt, and, the, only, victim, he, mentioned, was, the, german, people, historian, martin, kitchen, states, that, speer, was, actually, fully, aware, of, what, had, happened, to, the, jews, and, was, intimately, involved, in, the, final, solution, brechtken, said, speer, only, admitted, to, a, generalized, responsibility, for, the, holocaust, to, hide, his, direct, and, actual, responsibility, speer, was, photographed, with, slave, laborers, at, mauthausen, concentration, camp, during, a, visit, on, 31, march, 1943, he, also, visited, gusen, concentration, camp, although, survivor, francisco, boix, testified, at, the, nuremberg, trials, about, speer, s, visit, taylor, writes, that, had, the, photo, been, available, he, would, have, been, hanged, in, 2005, the, daily, telegraph, reported, that, documents, had, surfaced, indicating, that, speer, had, approved, the, allocation, of, materials, for, the, expansion, of, auschwitz, concentration, camp, after, two, of, his, assistants, inspected, the, facility, on, a, day, when, almost, a, thousand, jews, were, massacred, heinrich, breloer, discussing, the, construction, of, auschwitz, said, speer, was, not, just, a, cog, in, the, work, he, was, the, terror, itself, speer, did, not, deny, being, present, at, the, posen, speeches, to, nazi, leaders, at, a, conference, in, posen, pozna, on, 6, october, 1943, but, claimed, to, have, left, the, auditorium, before, himmler, said, during, his, speech, the, grave, decision, had, to, be, taken, to, cause, this, people, to, vanish, from, the, earth, and, later, the, jews, must, be, exterminated, speer, is, mentioned, several, times, in, the, speech, and, himmler, addresses, him,

friedrich, fromm, georg, thomas, and, fritz, todt, had, come, to, the, conclusion, that, the, war, could, not, be, won, the, rational, position, to, adopt, was, to, seek, a, political, solution, that, would, end, the, war, without, defeat, speer, in, response, used, his, propaganda, expertise, to, display, a, new, dynamism, of, the, war, economy, he, produced, spectacular, statistics, claiming, a, sixfold, increase, in, munitions, production, a, fourfold, increase, in, artillery, production, and, he, sent, further, propaganda, to, the, newsreels, of, the, country, he, was, able, to, curtail, the, discussion, that, the, war, should, be, ended, the, armaments, miracle, was, a, myth, speer, had, used, statistical, manipulation, to, support, his, claims, the, production, of, armaments, did, rise, however, this, was, due, to, the, normal, causes, of, reorganization, before, speer, came, to, office, the, relentless, mobilization, of, slave, labor, and, a, deliberate, reduction, in, the, quality, of, output, to, favor, quantity, by, july, 1943, speer, s, armaments, propaganda, became, irrelevant, because, a, catalogue, of, dramatic, defeats, on, the, battlefield, meant, the, prospect,
