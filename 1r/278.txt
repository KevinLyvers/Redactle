windsor, forest, this, was, due, to, strong, anti, catholic, sentiment, and, a, statute, preventing, papists, from, living, within, 10, miles, 16, km, of, london, or, westminster, pope, would, later, describe, the, countryside, around, the, house, in, his, poem, windsor, forest, pope, s, formal, education, ended, at, this, time, and, from, then, on, he, mostly, educated, himself, by, reading, the,

was, already, removed, from, society, as, a, catholic, and, his, poor, health, alienated, him, further, although, he, never, married, he, had, many, female, friends, to, whom, he, wrote, witty, letters, including, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, it, has, been, alleged, that, his, lifelong, friend, martha, blount, was, his, lover, his, friend, william, cheselden, said, according, to, joseph, spence, i, could, give, a, more, particular, account, of, mr, pope, s, health, than, perhaps, any, man, cibber, s, slander, of, carnosity, is, false, he, had, been, gay, but, left, that, way, of, life, upon, his, acquaintance, with, mrs, b, in, may, 1709, pope, s, pastorals, was, published, in, the, sixth, part, of, bookseller, jacob, tonson, s, poetical, miscellanies, this, earned, pope, instant, fame, and, was, followed, by, an, essay, on, criticism, published, in, may, 1711, which, was, equally, well, received, around, 1711, pope, made, friends, with, tory, writers, jonathan, swift, thomas, parnell, and, john, arbuthnot, who, together, formed, the, satirical, scriblerus, club, its, aim, was, to, satirise, ignorance, and, pedantry, through, the, fictional, scholar, martinus, scriblerus, he, also, made, friends, with, whig, writers, joseph, addison, and, richard, steele, in, march, 1713, windsor, forest, was, published, to, great, acclaim, during, pope, s, friendship, with, joseph, addison, he, contributed, to, addison, s, play, cato, as, well, as, writing, for, the, guardian, and, the, spectator, around, this, time, he, began, the, work, of, translating, the, iliad, which, was, a, painstaking, process, publication, began, in, 1715, and, did, not, end, until, 1720, in, 1714, the, political, situation, worsened, with, the, death, of, queen, anne, and, the, disputed, succession, between, the, hanoverians, and, the, jacobites, leading, to, the, jacobite, rising, of, 1715, though, pope, as, a, catholic, might, have, been, expected, to, have, supported, the, jacobites, because, of, his, religious, and, political, affiliations, according, to, maynard, mack, where, pope, himself, stood, on, these, matters, can, probably, never, be, confidently, known, these, events, led, to, an, immediate, downturn, in, the, fortunes, of, the, tories, and, pope, s, friend, henry, st, john, 1st, viscount, bolingbroke, fled, to, france, this, was, added, to, by, the, impeachment, of, the, former, tory, chief, minister, lord, oxford, pope, lived, in, his, parents, house, in, mawson, row, chiswick, between, 1716, and, 1719, the, red, brick, building, is, now, the, mawson, arms, commemorating, him, with, a, blue, plaque, the, money, made, from, his, translation, of, homer, allowed, pope, to, move, in, 1719, to, a, villa, at, twickenham, where, he, created, his, now, famous, grotto, and, gardens, the, serendipitous, discovery, of, a, spring, during, the, excavation, of, the, subterranean, retreat, enabled, it, to, be, filled, with, the, relaxing, sound, of, trickling, water, which, would, quietly, echo, around, the, chambers, pope, was, said, to, have, remarked, were, it, to, have, nymphs, as, well, it, would, be, complete, in, everything, although, the, house, and, gardens, have, long, since, been, demolished, much, of, the, grotto, survives, beneath, radnor, house, independent, co, educational, school, the, grotto, has, been, restored, and, will, open, to, the, public, for, 30, weekends, a, year, from, 2023, under, the, auspices, of, pope, s, grotto, preservation, trust, an, essay, on, criticism, was, first, published, anonymously, on, 15, may, 1711, pope, began, writing, the, poem, early, in, his, career, and, took, about, three, years, to, finish, it, at, the, time, the, poem, was, published, its, heroic, couplet, style, was, quite, a, new, poetic, form, and, pope, s, work, an, ambitious, attempt, to, identify, and, refine, his, own, positions, as, a, poet, and, critic, it, was, said, to, be, a, response, to, an, ongoing, debate, on, the, question, of, whether, poetry, should, be, natural, or, written, according, to, predetermined, artificial, rules, inherited, from, the, classical, past, the, essay, begins, with, a, discussion, of, the, standard, rules, that, govern, poetry, by, which, a, critic, passes, judgement, pope, comments, on, the, classical, authors, who, dealt, with, such, standards, and, the, authority, he, believed, should, be, accredited, to, them, he, discusses, the, laws, to, which, a, critic, should, adhere, while, analysing, poetry, pointing, out, the, important, function, critics, perform, in, aiding, poets, with, their, works, as, opposed, to, simply, attacking, them, the, final, section, of, an, essay, on, criticism, discusses, the, moral, qualities, and, virtues, inherent, in, an, ideal, critic, whom, pope, claims, is, also, the, ideal, man, pope, s, most, famous, poem, is, the, rape, of, the, lock, first, published, in, 1712, with, a, revised, version, in, 1714, a, mock, epic, it, satirises, a, high, society, quarrel, between, arabella, fermor, the, belinda, of, the, poem, and, lord, petre, who, had, snipped, a, lock, of, hair, from, her, head, without, permission, the, satirical, style, is, tempered, however, by, a, genuine, almost, voyeuristic, interest, in, the, beau, monde, fashionable, world, of, 18th, century, society, the, revised, extended, version, of, the, poem, focuses, more, clearly, on, its, true, subject, the, onset, of, acquisitive, individualism, and, a, society, of, conspicuous, consumers, in, the, poem, purchased, artefacts, displace, human, agency, and, trivial, things, come, to, dominate, though, the, dunciad, first, appeared, anonymously, in, dublin, its, authorship, was, not, in, doubt, pope, pilloried, a, host, of, other, hacks, scribblers, and, dunces, in, addition, to, theobald, and, maynard, mack, has, accordingly, called, its, publication, in, many, ways, the, greatest, act, of, folly, in, pope, s, life, though, a, masterpiece, due, to, having, become, one, of, the, most, challenging, and, distinctive, works, in, the, history, of, english, poetry, writes, mack, it, bore, bitter, fruit, it, brought, the, poet, in, his, own, time, the, hostility, of, its, victims, and, their, sympathizers, who, pursued, him, implacably, from, then, on, with, a, few, damaging, truths, and, a, host, of, slanders, and, lies, according, to, his, half, sister, magdalen, rackett, some, of, pope, s, targets, were, so, enraged, by, the, dunciad, that, they, threatened, him, physically, my, brother, does, not, seem, to, know, what, fear, is, she, told, joseph, spence, explaining, that, pope, loved, to, walk, alone, so, went, accompanied, by, his, great, dane, bounce, and, for, some, time, carried, pistols, in, his, pocket, this, first, dunciad, along, with, john, gay, s, the, beggar, s, opera, and, jonathan, swift, s, gulliver, s, travels, joined, in, a, concerted, propaganda, assault, against, robert, walpole, s, whig, ministry, and, the, financial, revolution, it, stabilised, although, pope, was, a, keen, participant, in, the, stock, and, money, markets, he, never, missed, a, chance, to, satirise, the, personal, social, and, political, effects, of, the, new, scheme, of, things, from, the, rape, of, the, lock, onwards, these, satirical, themes, appear, constantly, in, his, work, in, 1731, pope, published, his, epistle, to, burlington, on, the, subject, of, architecture, the, first, of, four, poems, later, grouped, as, the, moral, essays, 1731, 1735, the, epistle, ridicules, the, bad, taste, of, the, aristocrat, timon, for, example, the, following, are, verses, 99, and, 100, of, the, epistle, at, timon, s, villa, let, us, pa, s, a, day, where, all, cry, out, what, ums, are, thrown, away, pope, s, foes, claimed, he, was, attacking, the, duke, of, chandos, and, his, estate, cannons, though, the, charge, was, untrue, it, did, much, damage, to, pope, there, has, been, some, speculation, on, a, feud, between, pope, and, thomas, hearne, due, in, part, to, the, character, of, wormius, in, the, dunciad, who, is, seemingly, based, on, hearne, an, essay, on, man, is, a, philosophical, poem, in, heroic, couplets, published, between, 1732, and, 1734, pope, meant, it, as, the, centrepiece, of, a, proposed, system, of, ethics, to, be, put, forth, in, poetic, form, it, was, a, piece, that, he, sought, to, make, into, a, larger, work, but, he, did, not, live, to, complete, it, it, attempts, to, vindicate, the, ways, of, god, to, man, a, variation, on, milton, s, attempt, in, paradise, lost, to, justify, the, ways, of, god, to, man, 1, 26, it, challenges, as, prideful, an, anthropocentric, worldview, the, poem, is, not, solely, christian, however, it, assumes, that, man, has, fallen, and, must, seek, his, own, salvation, consisting, of, four, epistles, addressed, to, lord, bolingbroke, it, presents, an, idea, of, pope, s, view, of, the, universe, no, matter, how, imperfect, complex, inscrutable, and, disturbing, the, universe, may, be, it, functions, in, a, rational, fashion, according, to, natural, laws, so, that, the, universe, as, a, whole, is, a, perfect, work, of, god, though, to, humans, it, appears, to, be, evil, and, imperfect, in, many, ways, pope, ascribes, this, to, our, limited, mindset, and, intellectual, capacity, he, argues, that, humans, must, accept, their, position, in, the, great, chain, of, being, at, a, middle, stage, between, the, angels, and, the, beasts, of, the, world, accomplish, this, and, we, potentially, could, lead, happy, and, virtuous, lives, the, poem, is, an, affirmative, statement, of, faith, life, seems, chaotic, and, confusing, to, man, in, the, centre, of, it, but, according, to, pope, it, is, truly, divinely, ordered, in, pope, s, world, god, exists, and, is, what, he, centres, the, universe, around, as, an, ordered, structure, the, limited, intelligence, of, man, can, only, take, in, tiny, portions, of, this, order, and, experience, only, partial, truths, hence, man, must, rely, on, hope, which, then, leads, to, faith, man, must, be, aware, of, his, existence, in, the, universe, and, what, he, brings, to, it, in, terms, of, riches, power, and, fame, pope, proclaims, that, man, s, duty, is, to, strive, to, be, good, regardless, of, other, situations, father, of, all, in, every,

universal, prayer, the, imitations, of, horace, that, followed, 1733, 1738, were, written, in, the, popular, augustan, form, of, an, imitation, of, a, classical, poet, not, so, much, a, translation, of, his, works, as, an, updating, with, contemporary, references, pope, used, the, model, of, horace, to, satirise, life, under, george, ii, especially, what, he, saw, as, the, widespread, corruption, tainting, the, country, under, walpole, s, influence, and, the, poor, quality, of, the, court, s, artistic, taste, pope, added, as, an, introduction, to, imitations, a, wholly, original, poem, that, reviews, his, own, literary, career, and, includes, famous, portraits, of, lord, hervey, sporus, thomas, hay, 9th, earl, of, kinnoull, balbus, and, addison, atticus, in, 1738, came, the, universal, prayer, among, the, younger, poets, whose, work, pope, admired, was, joseph, thurston, after, 1738, pope, himself, wrote, little, he, toyed, with, the, idea, of, composing, a, patriotic, epic, in, blank, verse, called, brutus, but, only, the, opening, lines, survive, his, major, work, in, those, years, was, to, revise, and, expand, his, masterpiece, the, dunciad, book, four, appeared, in, 1742, and, a, full, revision, of, the, whole, poem, the, following, year, here, pope, replaced, the, hero, lewis, theobald, with, the, poet, laureate, colley, cibber, as, king, of, dunces, however, the, real, focus, of, the, revised, poem, is, walpole, and, his, works, by, now, pope, s, health, which, had, never, been, good, was, failing, when, told, by, his, physician, on, the, morning, of, his, death, that, he, was, better, pope, replied, here, am, i, dying, of, a, hundred, good, symptoms, he, died, at, his, villa, surrounded, by, friends, on, 30, may, 1744, about, eleven, o, clock, at, night, on, the, previous, day, 29, may, 1744, pope, had, called, for, a, priest, and, received, the, last, rites, of, the, catholic, church, he, was, buried, in, the, nave, of, st, mary, s, church, twickenham, pope, had, been, fascinated, by, homer, since, childhood, in, 1713, he, announced, plans, to, publish, a, translation, of, the, iliad, the, work, would, be, available, by, subscription, with, one, volume, appearing, every, year, over, six, years, pope, secured, a, revolutionary, deal, with, the, publisher, bernard, lintot, which, earned, him, 200, guineas, 210, a, volume, a, vast, sum, at, the, time, his, iliad, translation, appeared, between, 1715, and, 1720, it, was, acclaimed, by, samuel, johnson, as, a, performance, which, no, age, or, nation, could, hope, to, equal, conversely, the, classical, scholar, richard, bentley, wrote, it, is, a, pretty, poem, mr, pope, but, you, must, not, call, it, homer, encouraged, by, the, success, of, the, iliad, bernard, lintot, published, pope, s, five, volume, translation, of, homer, s, odyssey, in, 1725, 1726, for, this, pope, collaborated, with, william, broome, and, elijah, fenton, broome, translated, eight, books, 2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 23, fenton, four, 1, 4, 19, 20, and, pope, the, remaining, twelve, broome, provided, the, annotations, pope, tried, to, conceal, the, extent, of, the, collaboration, but, the, secret, leaked, out, it, did, some, damage, to, pope, s, reputation, for, a, time, but, not, to, his, profits, leslie, stephen, considered, pope, s, portion, of, the, odyssey, inferior, to, his, version, of, the, iliad, given, that, pope, had, put, more, effort, into, the, earlier, work, to, which, in, any, case, his, style, was, better, suited, in, this, period, pope, was, employed, by, the, publisher, jacob, tonson, to, produce, an, opulent, new, edition, of, shakespeare, when, it, appeared, in, 1725, it, silently, regularised, shakespeare, s, metre, and, rewrote, his, verse, in, several, places, pope, also, removed, about, 1, 560, lines, of, shakespeare, s, material, arguing, that, some, appealed, to, him, more, than, others, in, 1726, the, lawyer, poet, and, pantomime, deviser, lewis, theobald, published, a, scathing, pamphlet, called, shakespeare, restored, which, catalogued, the, errors, in, pope, s, work, and, suggested, several, revisions, to, the, text, this, enraged, pope, wherefore, theobald, became, the, main, target, of, pope, s, dunciad, the, second, edition, of, pope, s, shakespeare, appeared, in, 1728, apart, from, some, minor, revisions, to, the, preface, it, seems, that, pope, had, little, to, do, with, it, most, later, 18th, century, editors, of, shakespeare, dismissed, pope, s, creatively, motivated, approach, to, textual, criticism, pope, s, preface, continued, to, be, highly, rated, it, was, suggested, that, shakespeare, s, texts, were, thoroughly, contaminated, by, actors, interpolations, and, they, would, influence, editors, for, most, of, the, 18th, century, pope, s, poetic, career, testifies, to, an, indomitable, spirit, despite, disadvantages, of, health, and, circumstance, the, poet, and, his, family, were, catholics, and, so, fell, subject, to, the, prohibitive, test, acts, which, hampered, their, co, religionists, after, the, abdication, of, james, ii, one, of, these, banned, them, from, living, within, ten, miles, of, london, another, from, attending, public, school, or, university, so, except, for, a, few, spurious, catholic, schools, pope, was, largely, self, educated, he, was, taught, to, read, by, his, aunt, and, became, a, book, lover, reading, in, french, italian, latin, and, greek, and, discovering, homer, at, the, age, of, six, in, 1700, when, only, twelve, years, of, age, he, wrote, his, poem, ode, on, solitude, as, a, child, pope, survived, once, being, trampled, by, a, cow, but, when, he, was, 12, he, began, struggling, with, tuberculosis, of, the, spine, pott, disease, which, restricted, his, growth, so, that, he, was, only, 4, feet, 6, inches, 1, 37, metres, tall, as, an, adult, he, also, suffered, from, crippling, headaches, in, the, year, 1709, pope, showcased, his, precocious, metrical, skill, with, the, publication, of, pastorals, his, first, major, poems, they, earned, him, instant, fame, by, the, age, of, 23, he, had, written, an, essay, on, criticism, released, in, 1711, a, kind, of, poetic, manifesto, in, the, vein, of, horace, s, ars, poetica, it, met, with, enthusiastic, attention, and, won, pope, a, wider, circle, of, prominent, friends, notably, joseph, addison, and, richard, steele, who, had, recently, begun, to, collaborate, on, the, influential, the, spectator, the, critic, john, dennis, having, found, an, ironic, and, veiled, portrait, of, himself, was, outraged, by, what, he, saw, as, the, impudence, of, a, younger, author, dennis, hated, pope, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, save, for, a, temporary, reconciliation, dedicated, his, efforts, to, insulting, him, in, print, to, which, pope, retaliated, in, kind, making, dennis, the, butt, of, much, satire, a, folio, containing, a, collection, of, his, poems, appeared, in, 1717, along, with, two, new, ones, about, the, passion, of, love, verses, to, the, memory, of, an, unfortunate, lady, and, the, famous, proto, romantic, poem, eloisa, to, abelard, though, pope, never, married, about, this, time, he, became, strongly, attached, to, lady, m, montagu, whom, he, indirectly, referenced, in, his, popular, eloisa, to, abelard, and, to, martha, blount, with, whom, his, friendship, continued, through, his, life, as, a, satirist, pope, made, his, share, of, enemies, as, critics, politicians, and, certain, other, prominent, figures, felt, the, sting, of, his, sharp, witted, satires, some, were, so, virulent, that, pope, even, carried, pistols, while, walking, his, dog, in, 1738, and, thenceforth, pope, composed, relatively, little, he, began, having, ideas, for, a, patriotic, epic, in, blank, verse, titled, brutus, but, mainly, revised, and, expanded, his, dunciad, book, four, appeared, in, 1742, and, a, complete, revision, of, the, whole, in, the, year, that, followed, at, this, time, lewis, theobald, was, replaced, with, the, poet, laureate, colley, cibber, as, king, of, dunces, but, his, real, target, remained, the, whig, politician, robert, walpole, by, the, mid, 18th, century, new, fashions, in, poetry, emerged, a, decade, after, pope, s, death, joseph, warton, claimed, that, pope, s, style, was, not, the, most, excellent, form, of, the, art, the, romantic, movement, that, rose, to, prominence, in, early, 19th, century, england, was, more, ambivalent, about, his, work, though, lord, byron, identified, pope, as, one, of, his, chief, influences, believing, his, own, scathing, satire, of, contemporary, english, literature, english, bards, and, scotch, reviewers, to, be, a, continuance, of, pope, s, tradition, william, wordsworth, found, pope, s, style, too, decadent, to, represent, the, human, condition, george, gilfillan, in, an, 1856, study, called, pope, s, talent, a, rose, peering, into, the, summer, air, fine, rather, than, powerful, pope, s, reputation, revived, in, the, 20th, century, his, work, was, full, of, references, to, the, people, and, places, of, his, time, which, aided, people, s, understanding,
