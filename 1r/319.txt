new, moral, philosophy, the, morality, of, rational, self, interest, it, advocates, the, core, tenets, of, rand, s, philosophy, of, objectivism, and, expresses, her, concept, of, human, achievement,

standards, sometimes, reacting, coldly, or, angrily, to, those, who, disagreed, with, her, critics, including, some, former, nbi, students, and, branden, himself, later, said, the, nbi, culture, was,

strongly, negative, atlas, shrugged, received, positive, reviews, from, a, few, publications, but, rand, scholar, mimi, reisel, gladstein, later, wrote, that, reviewers, seemed, to, vie, with, each,

far, fewer, reviews, than, her, novels, the, tenor, of, the, criticism, for, her, first, nonfiction, book, for, the, new, intellectual, was, similar, to, that, for, atlas, shrugged, philosopher, sidney, hook, likened, her, certainty, to, the, way, philosophy, is, written, in, the, soviet, union, and, author, gore, vidal, called, her, viewpoint, nearly, perfect, in, its, immorality, these,

cliffsnotes, and, sparknotes, in, the, literary, encyclopedia, entry, for, rand, written, in, 2001, john, david, lewis, declared, that, rand, wrote, the, most, intellectually, challenging, fiction, of, her, generation, in, 2019, lisa, duggan, described, rand, s, fiction, as, popular, and, influential, on, many, readers, despite, being, easy, to, criticize, for, her, cartoonish, characters, and, melodramatic, plots, her, rigid, moralizing, her, middle, to, lowbrow, aesthetic, preferences, and, philosophical, strivings, ayn, rand, institute, other, rand, called, her, philosophy, objectivism, describing, its, essence, as, the, concept, of, man, as, a, heroic, being, with, his, own, happiness, as, the, moral, purpose, of, his, life, with, productive, achievement, as, his, noblest, activity, and, reason, as, his, only, absolute, she, considered, objectivism, a, systematic, philosophy, and, laid, out, positions, on, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, and, political, philosophy, in, metaphysics, rand, supported, philosophical, realism, and, opposed, anything, she, regarded, as, mysticism, or, supernaturalism, including, all, forms, of, religion, rand, believed, in, free, will, as, a, form, of, agent, causation, and, rejected, determinism, in, aesthetics, rand, defined, art, as, a, selective, re, creation, of, reality, according, to, an, artist, s, metaphysical, value, judgments, according, to, her, art, allows, philosophical, concepts, to, be, presented, in, a, concrete, form, that, can, be, grasped, easily, thereby, fulfilling, a, need, of, human, consciousness, as, a, writer, the, art, form, rand, focused, on, most, closely, was, literature, in, works, such, as, the, romantic, manifesto, and, the, art, of, fiction, she, described, romanticism, the, approach, that, most, accurately, reflects, the, existence, of, human, free, will, in, epistemology, rand, considered, all, knowledge, to, be, based, on, forming, higher, levels, of, understanding, from, sense, perception, the, validity, of, which, she, considered, axiomatic, she, described, reason, as, the, faculty, that, identifies, and, integrates, the, material, provided, by, man, s, senses, rand, rejected, all, claims, of, non, perceptual, knowledge, including, instinct, intuition, revelation, or, any, form, of, just, knowing, in, her, introduction, to, objectivist, epistemology, rand, presented, a, theory, of, concept, formation, and, rejected, the, analytic, synthetic, dichotomy, she, believed, epistemology, was, a, foundational, branch, of, philosophy, and, considered, the, advocacy, of, reason, to, be, the, single, most, significant, aspect, of, her, philosophy, commentators, including, hazel, barnes, nathaniel, branden, and, albert, ellis, have, criticized, rand, s, focus, on, the, importance, of, reason, barnes, and, ellis, said, rand, was, too, dismissive, of, emotion, and, failed, to, recognize, its, importance, in, human, life, branden, said, rand, s, emphasis, on, reason, led, her, to, denigrate, emotions, and, create, unrealistic, expectations, of, how, consistently, rational, human, beings, should, be, in, ethics, rand, argued, for, rational,

sacrificing, others, to, himself, rand, referred, to, egoism, as, the, virtue, of, selfishness, in, her, book, of, that, title, in, it, she, presented, her, solution, to, the, is, ought, problem, by, describing, a, meta, ethical, theory, that, based, morality, in, the, needs, of, man, s, survival, qua, man, which, requires, the, use, of, a, rational, mind, she, condemned, ethical, altruism, as, incompatible, with, the, requirements, of, human, life, and, happiness, and, held, the, initiation, of, force, was, evil, and, irrational, writing, in, atlas, shrugged, that, force, and, mind, are, opposites, rand, s, ethics, and, politics, are, the, most, criticized, areas, of, her, philosophy, several, authors, including, robert, nozick, and, william, f, o, neill, in, two, of, the, earliest, academic, critiques, of, her, ideas, said, she, failed, in, her, attempt, to, solve, the, is, ought, problem, critics, have, called, her, definitions, of, egoism, and, altruism, biased, and, inconsistent, with, normal, usage, critics, from, religious, traditions, oppose, her, atheism, and, her, rejection, of, altruism, rand, s, political, philosophy, emphasized, individual, rights, including, property, rights, she, considered, laissez, faire, capitalism, the, only, moral, social, system, because, in, her, view, it, was, the, only, system, based, on, protecting, those, rights, rand, opposed, collectivism, and, statism, which, she, considered, to, include, many, specific, forms, of, government, such, as, communism, fascism, socialism, theocracy, and, the, welfare, state, her, preferred, form, of, government, was, a, constitutional, republic, that, is, limited, to, the, protection, of, individual, rights, although, her, political, views, are, often, classified, as, conservative, or, libertarian, rand, preferred, the, term, radical, for, capitalism, she, worked, with, conservatives, on, political, projects, but, disagreed, with, them, over, issues, such, as, religion, and, ethics, rand, rejected, anarchism, as, a, naive, theory, based, in, subjectivism, that, would, lead, to, collectivism, in, practice, and, denounced, libertarianism, which, she, associated, with, anarchism, several, critics, including, nozick, have, said, her, attempt, to, justify, individual, rights, based, on, egoism, fails, others, like, libertarian, philosopher, michael, huemer, have, gone, further, saying, that, her, support, of, egoism, and, her, support, of, individual, rights, are, inconsistent, positions, some, critics, like, roy, childs, have, said, that, her, opposition, to, the, initiation, of, force, should, lead, to, support, of, anarchism, rather, than, limited, government, except, for, aristotle, thomas, aquinas, and, classical, liberals, rand, was, sharply, critical, of, most, philosophers, and, philosophical, traditions, known, to, her, acknowledging, aristotle, as, her, greatest, influence, rand, remarked, that, in, the, history, of, philosophy, she, could, only, recommend, three, a, s, aristotle, aquinas, and, ayn, rand, in, a, 1959, interview, with, mike, wallace, when, asked, where, her, philosophy, came, from, she, responded, out, of, my, own, mind, with, the, sole, acknowledgement, of, a, debt, to, aristotle, the, only, philosopher, who, ever, influenced, me, in, an, article, for, the, claremont, review, of, books, political, scientist, charles, murray, criticized, rand, s, claim, that, her, only, philosophical, debt, was, to, aristotle, he, asserted, her, ideas, were, derivative, of, previous, thinkers, such, as, john, locke, and, friedrich, nietzsche, rand, took, early, inspiration, from, nietzsche, and, scholars, have, found, indications, of, this, in, rand, s, private, journals, in, 1928, she, alluded, to, his, idea, of, the, superman, in, notes, for, an, unwritten, novel, whose, protagonist, was, inspired, by, the, murderer, william, edward, hickman, there, are, other, indications, of, nietzsche, s, influence, in, passages, from, the, first, edition, of, we, the, living, which, rand, later, revised, and, in, her, overall, writing, style, by, the, time, she, wrote, the, fountainhead, rand, had, turned, against, nietzsche, s, ideas, and, the, extent, of, his, influence, on, her, even, during, her, early, years, is, disputed, rand, s, views, also, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, promotion, of, egoism, among, the, russian, nihilists, including, chernyshevsky, and, dmitry, pisarev, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, that, she, read, them, rand, considered, immanuel, kant, her, philosophical, opposite, and, the, most, evil, man, in, mankind, s, history, she, believed, his, epistemology, undermined, reason, and, his, ethics, opposed, self, interest, philosophers, george, walsh, and, fred, seddon, have, argued, she, misinterpreted, kant, and, exaggerated, their, differences, she, was, also, critical, of, plato, and, viewed, his, differences, with, aristotle, on, questions, of, metaphysics, and, epistemology, as, the, primary, conflict, in, the, history, of, philosophy, rand, s, relationship, with, contemporary, philosophers, was, mostly, antagonistic, she, was, not, an, academic, and, did, not, participate, in, academic, discourse, she, was, dismissive, of, critics, and, wrote, about, ideas, she, disagreed, with, in, a, polemical, manner, without, in, depth, analysis, academic, philosophers, in, turn, viewed, her, negatively, and, dismissed, her, as, an, unimportant, figure, who, should, not, be, considered, a, philosopher, or, given, any, serious, response, during, rand, s, lifetime, her, work, received, little, attention, from, academic, scholars, in, 1967, john, hospers, discussed, rand, s, ethical, ideas, in, the, second, edition, of, his, textbook, an, introduction, to, philosophical, analysis, that, same, year, hazel, barnes, included, a, chapter, critiquing, objectivism, in, her, book, an, existentialist, ethics, when, the, first, full, length, academic, book, about, rand, s, philosophy, appeared, in, 1971, its, author, declared, writing, about, rand, a, treacherous, undertaking, that, could, lead, to, guilt, by, association, for, taking, her, seriously, a, few, articles, about, rand, s, ideas, appeared, in, academic, journals, before, her, death, in, 1982, many, of, them, in, the, personalist, one, of, these, was, on, the, randian, argument, by, libertarian, philosopher, robert, nozick, who, criticized, her, meta, ethical, arguments, in, the, same, journal, other, philosophers, argued, that, nozick, misstated, rand, s, case, in, an, article, responding, to, nozick, douglas, den, uyl, and, douglas, b, rasmussen, defended, her, positions, but, described, her, style, as, literary, hyperbolic, and, emotional, after, her, death, interest, in, rand, s, ideas, increased, gradually, the, philosophic, thought, of, ayn, rand, a, 1984, collection, of, essays, about, objectivism, edited, by, den, uyl, and, rasmussen, was, the, first, academic, book, about, rand, s, ideas, published, after, her, death, in, one, essay, political, writer, jack, wheeler, wrote, that, despite, the, incessant, bombast, and, continuous, venting, of, randian, rage, rand, s, ethics, are, a, most, immense, achievement, the, study, of, which, is, vastly, more, fruitful, than, any, other, in, contemporary, thought, in, 1987, the, ayn, rand, society, was, founded, as, an, affiliate, of, the, american, philosophical, association, in, a, 1995, entry, about, rand, in, contemporary, women, philosophers, jenny, a, heyl, described, a, divergence, in, how, different, academic, specialties, viewed, rand, she, said, that, rand, s, philosophy, is, regularly, omitted, from, academic, philosophy, yet, throughout, literary, academia, ayn, rand, is, considered, a, philosopher, writing, in, the, 1998, edition, of, the, routledge, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, political, theorist, chandran, kukathas, summarized, the, mainstream, philosophical, reception, of, her, work, in, two, parts, he, said, most, commentators, view, her, ethical, argument, as, an, unconvincing, variant, of, aristotle, s, ethics, and, her, political, theory, is, of, little, interest, because, it, is, marred, by, an, ill, thought, out, and, unsystematic, effort, to, reconcile, her, hostility, to, the, state, with, her, rejection, of, anarchism, the, journal, of, ayn, rand, studies, a, multidisciplinary, peer, reviewed, academic, journal, devoted, to, the, study, of, rand, and, her, ideas, was, established, in, 1999, in, 2009, historian, jennifer, burns, identified, an, explosion, of, scholarship, about, rand, since, 2000, although, as, of, that, year, few, universities, included, rand, or, objectivism, as, a, philosophical, specialty, or, research, area, from, 2002, to, 2012, over, 60, colleges, and, universities, accepted, grants, from, the, charitable, foundation, of, bb, t, that, required, teaching, rand, s, ideas, or, works, in, some, cases, the, grants, were, controversial, or, even, rejected, because, of, the, requirement, to, teach, about, rand, in, a, 2010, essay, for, the, cato, institute, huemer, argued, very, few, people, find, rand, s, ideas, convincing, especially, her, ethics, he, attributed, the, attention, she, receives, to, her, being, a, compelling, writer, especially, as, a, novelist, in, 2012, the, pennsylvania, state, university, press, agreed, to, take, over, publication, of, the, journal, of, ayn, rand, studies, and, the, university, of, pittsburgh, press, launched,

said, that, only, a, few, professional, philosophers, have, taken, her, work, seriously, that, same, year, political, scientist, alan, wolfe, dismissed, rand, as, a, nonperson, among, academics, an, attitude, that, writer, ben, murnane, later, described, as, the, traditional, academic, view, of, rand, in, a, 2018, article, for, aeon, philosopher, skye, c, cleary, wrote, philosophers, love, to, hate, ayn, rand, it, s, trendy, to, scoff, at, any, mention, of, her, however, cleary, said, that, because, many, people, take, rand, s, ideas, seriously, philosophers, need, to, treat, the, ayn, rand, phenomenon, seriously, and, provide, refutations, rather, than, ignoring, her, in, 2020, media, critic, eric, burns, said, rand, is, surely, the, most, engaging, philosopher, of, my, lifetime, but, nobody, in, the, academe, pays, any, attention, to, her, neither, as, an, author, nor, a, philosopher, that, same, year, the, editor, of, a, collection, of, critical, essays, about, rand, said, academics, who, disapproved, of, her, ideas, had, long, held, a, stubborn, resolve, to, ignore, or, ridicule, her, work, but, he, believed, more, were, engaging, with, her, work, in, recent, years,
