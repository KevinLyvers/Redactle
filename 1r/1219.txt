in, what, is, now, eastern, afghanistan, bangladesh, northern, india, and, pakistan, from, 1530, to, 1540, and, again, from, 1555, to, his, death, in, 1556, at, the, time, of, his, death, the, mughal, empire, spanned, almost, one, million, square, kilometers, on, 26, december, 1530, humayun, succeeded, his, father, babur, to, the, throne, of, delhi, as, ruler, of, the, mughal, territories, in, the, indian, subcontinent, humayun, was, an, inexperienced, ruler, when, he, came, to, power, at, the, age, of, 22, his, half, brother, kamran, mirza, inherited, kabul, and, kandahar, the, northernmost, parts, of, their, father, s, empire, the, two, half, brothers, became, bitter, rivals, early, in, his, reign, humayun, lost, his, entire, state, to, sher, shah, suri, but, regained, it, 15, years, later, with, safavid, aid, his, return, from, persia, was, accompanied, by, a, large, retinue, of, persian, noblemen, signaling, an, important, change, in, mughal, court, culture, the, central, asian, origins, of, the, dynasty, were, largely, overshadowed, by, the, influences, of, persian, art, architecture, language, and, literature, to, this, day, stone, carvings, and, thousands, of, persian, manuscripts, in, india, dating, from, the, time, of, humayun, remain, in, the, subcontinent, following, his, return, to, power, humayun, quickly, expanded, the, empire, leaving, a, substantial, legacy, for, his, son, akbar, humayun, was, born, as, nasir, al, din, muhammad, to, babur, s, favorite, wife, m, ham, begum, on, tuesday, 6, march, 1508, according, to, abul, fazl, m, ham, was, related, to, the, noble, family, of, sultan, husayn, bayqara, the, timurid, ruler, of, herat, she, was, also, related, to, sheikh, ahmad, e, jami, the, decision, of, babur, to, divide, the, territories, of, his, empire, between, two, of, his, sons, was, unusual, in, india, although, it, had, been, a, common, central, asian, practice, since, the, time, of, genghis, khan, unlike, most, monarchies, which, practiced, primogeniture, the, timurids, followed, the, example, of, genghis, and, did, not, leave, an, entire, kingdom, to, the, eldest, son, although, under, that, system, only, a, chingissid, could, claim, sovereignty, and, khanal, authority, any, male, chinggisid, within, a, given, sub, branch, had, an, equal, right, to, the, throne, though, the, timurids, were, not, chinggisid, in, their, paternal, ancestry, while, genghis, khan, s, empire, had, been, peacefully, divided, between, his, sons, upon, his, death, almost, every, chinggisid, succession, since, had, resulted, in, fratricide, after, timur, s, death, his, territories, were, divided, among, pir, muhammad, miran, shah, khalil, sultan, and, shah, rukh, which, resulted, in, inter, family, warfare, upon, babur, s, death, humayun, s, territories, were, the, least, secure, he, had, ruled, only, four, years, and, not, all, umarah, nobles, viewed, humayun, as, the, rightful, ruler, indeed, earlier, when, babur, had, become, ill, some, of, the, nobles, had, tried, to, install, his, brother, in, law, mahdi, khwaja, as, ruler, although, this, attempt, failed, it, was, a, sign, of, problems, to, come, when, humayun, came, to, the, throne, of, the, mughal, empire, several, of, his, brothers, revolted, against, him, after, he, split, the, empire, among, them, another, brother, hindal, mirza, supported, humayun, but, was, assassinated, the, emperor, commenced, construction, of, a, tomb, for, his, brother, but, this, was, not, yet, finished, when, he, was, forced, to, flee, to, persia, sher, shah, suri, destroyed, the, structure, and, no, further, work, was, done, on, it, after, humayun, s, restoration, humayun, had, two, major, rivals, for, his, lands, sultan, bahadur, of, gujarat, to, the, southwest, and, sher, shah, suri, sher, khan, settled, along, the, river, ganges, in, bihar, to, the, east, humayun, s, first, campaign, was, to, confront, sher, shah, suri, halfway, through, this, offensive, humayun, had, to, abandon, it, to, focus, on, gujarat, where, a, threat, from, ahmed, shah, had, emerged, humayun, was, victorious, annexing, gujarat, malwa, champaner, and, the, great, fort, of, mandu, during, the, first, five, years, of, humayun, s, reign, bahadur, and, sher, khan, extended, their, rule, although, sultan, bahadur, faced, pressure, in, the, east, from, sporadic, conflicts, with, the, portuguese, while, the, mughals, had, obtained, firearms, via, the, ottoman, empire, bahadur, s, gujarat, had, acquired, them, through, a, series, of, contracts, drawn, up, with, the, portuguese, allowing, the, portuguese, to, establish, a, strategic, foothold, in, northwestern, india, in, 1535, humayun, was, made, aware, that, the, sultan, of, gujarat, was, planning, an, assault, on, the, mughal, territories, in, bayana, with, portuguese, aid, humayun, gathered, an, army, and, marched, on, bahadur, within, a, month, he, had, captured, the, forts, of, mandu, and, champaner, however, instead, of, pressing, his, attack, humayun, ceased, the, campaign, and, consolidated, his, newly, conquered, territory, sultan, bahadur, meanwhile, escaped, and, took, up, refuge, with, the, portuguese, like, his, father, humayun, was, a, frequent, user, of, opium, in, a, popular, revolt, bahadur, shah, recaptured, all, of, gujarat, in, 1536, and, began, an, attack, on, malwa, shortly, after, humayun, had, marched, on, gujarat, sher, shah, suri, saw, an, opportunity, to, wrest, control, of, agra, from, the, mughals, he, began, to, gather, his, army, together, hoping, for, a, rapid, and, decisive, siege, of, the, mughal, capital, upon, hearing, this, alarming, news, humayun, quickly, marched, his, troops, back, to, agra, allowing, bahadur, to, easily, regain, control, of, the, territories, humayun, had, recently, taken, in, february, 1537, however, bahadur, was, killed, when, a, botched, plan, to, kidnap, the, portuguese, viceroy, ended, in, a, fire, fight, that, the, sultan, lost, bahadur, s, passing, caused, a, power, vacuum, in, gujarat, which, ultimately, paved, the, way, for, the, mughals, to, become, the, region, s, dominant, force, while, humayun, succeeded, in, protecting, agra, from, sher, shah, the, second, city, of, the, empire, gaur, the, capital, of, the, vilayat, of, bengal, was, sacked, humayun, s, troops, had, been, delayed, while, trying, to, take, chunar, a, fort, occupied, by, sher, shah, s, son, in, order, to, protect, his, troops, from, an, attack, from, the, rear, the, stores, of, grain, at, gauri, the, largest, in, the, empire, were, emptied, and, humayun, arrived, to, see, corpses, littering, the, roads, the, vast, wealth, of, bengal, was, depleted, and, brought, east, giving, sher, shah, a, substantial, war, chest, sher, shah, withdrew, to, the, east, but, humayun, did, not, follow, instead, he, shut, himself, up, for, a, considerable, time, in, his, harem, and, indulged, himself, in, every, kind, of, luxury, hindal, humayun, s, 19, year, old, brother, had, agreed, to, aid, him, in, this, battle, and, protect, the, rear, from, attack, but, he, abandoned, his, position, and, withdrew, to, agra, where, he, decreed, himself, acting, emperor, when, humayun, sent, the, grand, mufti, sheikh, buhlul, to, reason, with, him, the, sheikh, was, killed, further, provoking, the, rebellion, hindal, ordered, that, the, khutba, or, sermon, in, the, main, mosque, be, surrounded, humayun, s, other, brother, kamran, mirza, marched, from, his, territories, in, the, punjab, ostensibly, to, aid, humayun, however, his, return, home, had, treacherous, motives, as, he, intended, to, stake, a, claim, for, humayun, s, apparently, collapsing, empire, he, brokered, a, deal, with, hindal, providing, that, his, brother, would, cease, all, acts, of, disloyalty, in, return, for, a, share, in, the, new, empire, which, kamran, would, create, once, humayun, was, deposed, in, june, 1539, sher, shah, met, humayun, in, the, battle, of, chausa, on, the, banks, of, the, ganges, near, buxar, this, was, to, become, an, entrenched, battle, in, which, both, sides, spent, a, lot, of, time, digging, themselves, into, positions, the, major, part, of, the, mughal, army, the, artillery, was, now, immobile, and, humayun, decided, to, engage, in, some, diplomacy, using, muhammad, aziz, as, ambassador, humayun, agreed, to, allow, sher, shah, to, rule, over, bengal, and, bihar, but, only, as, provinces, granted, to, him, by, his, emperor, humayun, falling, short, of, outright, sovereignty, the, two, rulers, also, struck, a, bargain, in, order, to, save, face, humayun, s, troops, would, charge, those, of, sher, shah, whose, forces, then, retreat, in, feigned, fear, thus, honour, would, supposedly, be, satisfied, once, the, army, of, humayun, had, made, its, charge, and, sher, shah, s, troops, made, their, agreed, upon, retreat, the, mughal, troops, relaxed, their, defensive, preparations, and, returned, to, their, entrenchments, without, posting, a, proper, guard, observing, the, mughals, vulnerability, sher, shah, reneged, on, his, earlier, agreement, that, very, night, his, army, approached, the, mughal, camp, and, finding, the, mughal, troops, unprepared, with, a, majority, asleep, they, advanced, and, killed, most, of, them, the, emperor, survived, by, swimming, across, the, ganges, using, an, air, filled, water, skin, and, quietly, returned, to, agra, humayun, was, assisted, across, the, ganges, by, shams, al, din, muhammad, when, humayun, returned, to, agra, he, found, that, all, three, of, his, brothers, were, present, humayun, once, again, not, only, pardoned, his, brothers, for, plotting, against, him, but, even, forgave, hindal, for, his, outright, betrayal, with, his, armies, travelling, at, a, leisurely, pace, sher, shah, was, gradually, drawing, closer, and, closer, to, agra, this, was, a, serious, threat, to, the, entire, family, but, humayun, and, kamran, squabbled, over, how, to, proceed, kamran, withdrew, after, humayun, refused, to, make, a, quick, attack, on, the, approaching, enemy, instead, opting, to, build, a, larger, army, under, his, own, name, when, kamran, returned, to, lahore, humayun, with, his, other, brothers, askari, and, hindal, marched, to, meet, sher, shah, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, east, of, agra, at, the, battle, of, kannauj, on, 17, may, 1540, humayun, was, soundly, defeated, he, retreated, to, agra, pursued, by, sher, shah, and, thence, through, delhi, to, lahore, sher, shah, s, founding, of, the, short, lived, sur, empire, with, its, capital, at, delhi, resulted, in, humayun, s, exile, for, 15, years, in, the, court, of, shah, tahmasp, i, the, four, brothers, were, united, in, lahore, but, every, day, they, were, informed, that, sher, shah, was, getting, closer, and, closer, when, he, reached, sirhind, humayun, sent, an, ambassador, carrying, the, message, i, have, left, you, the, whole, of, hindustan, leave, lahore, alone, and, let, sirhind, be, a, boundary, between, you, and, me, sher, shah, however, replied, i, have, left, you, kabul, you, should, go, there, kabul, was, the, capital, of, the, empire, of, humayun, s, brother, kamran, who, was, far, from, willing, to, hand, over, any, of, his, territories, to, his, brother, instead, kamran, approached, sher, shah, and, proposed, that, he, actually, revolt, against, his, brother, and, side, with, sher, shah, in, return, for, most, of, the, punjab, sher, shah, dismissed, his, help, believing, it, not, to, be, required, though, word, soon, spread, to, lahore, about, the, treacherous, proposal, and, humayun, was, urged, to, make, an, example, of, kamran, and, kill, him, humayun, refused, citing, the, last, words, of, his, father, babur, do, nothing, against, your, brothers, even, though, they, may, deserve, it, humayun, visited, guru, angad, at, around, 1540, after, humayun, lost, the, battle, of, kannauj, and, thereby, the, mughal, throne, to, sher, shah, suri, according, to, sikh, hagiographies, when, humayun, arrived, in, gurdwara, mal, akhara, sahib, at, khadur, sahib, guru, angad, was, sitting, and, teaching, children, the, failure, to, greet, the, emperor, immediately, angered, humayun, humayun, lashed, out, but, the, guru, reminded, him, that, the, time, when, you, needed, to, fight, when, you, lost, your, throne, you, ran, away, and, did, not, fight, and, now, you, want, to, attack, a, person, engaged, in, prayer, in, the, sikh, texts, written, more, than, a, century, after, the, event, guru, angad, is, said, to, have, blessed, the, emperor, and, reassured, him, that, someday, he, will, regain, the, throne, humayun, decided, it, would, be, wise, to, withdraw, still, further, he, and, his, army, rode, out, through, and, across, the, thar, desert, when, the, hindu, ruler, rao, maldeo, rathore, allied, with, sher, shah, suri, against, the, mughal, empire, in, many, accounts, humayun, mentions, how, he, and, his, pregnant, wife, had, to, trace, their, steps, through, the, desert, at, the, hottest, time, of, year, their, rations, were, low, and, they, had, little, to, eat, even, drinking, water, was, a, major, problem, in, the, desert, when, hamida, bano, s, horse, died, no, one, would, lend, the, queen, who, was, now, eight, months, pregnant, a, horse, so, humayun, did, so, himself, resulting, in, him, riding, a, camel, for, six, kilometres, four, miles, although, khaled, beg, then, offered, him, his, mount, humayun, was, later, to, describe, this, incident, as, the, lowest, point, in, his, life, humayun, asked, that, his, brothers, join, him, as, he, fell, back, into, sindh, while, the, previously, rebellious, hindal, mirza, remained, loyal, and, was, ordered, to, join, his, brothers, in, kandahar, kamran, mirza, and, askari, mirza, instead, decided, to, head, to, the, relative, peace, of, kabul, this, was, to, be, a, definitive, schism, in, the, family, humayun, headed, for, sindh, because, he, expected, aid, from, the, emir, of, sindh, hussein, umrani, whom, he, had, appointed, and, who, owed, him, his, allegiance, also, his, wife, hamida, hailed, from, sindh, she, was, the, daughter, of, a, prestigious, pir, family, a, pir, is, an, islamic, religious, guide, of, persian, heritage, long, settled, in, sindh, en, route, to, the, emir, s, court, humayun, had, to, break, journey, because, his, pregnant, wife, hamida, was, unable, to, travel, further, humayun, sought, refuge, with, the, hindu, ruler, of, the, oasis, town, of, amarkot, now, part, of, sindh, province, rana, prasad, rao, of, amarkot, duly, welcomed, humayun, into, his, home, and, sheltered, the, refugees, for, several, months, here, in, the, household, of, a, hindu, rajput, nobleman, humayun, s, wife, hamida, bano, daughter, of, a, sindhi, family, gave, birth, to, the, future, emperor, akbar, on, 15, october, 1542, the, date, of, birth, is, well, established, because, humayun, consulted, his, astronomer, to, utilise, the, astrolabe, and, check, the, location, of, the, planets, the, infant, was, the, long, awaited, heir, apparent, to, the, 34, year, old, humayun, and, the, answer, of, many, prayers, shortly, after, the, birth, humayun, and, his, party, left, amarkot, for, sindh, leaving, akbar, behind, who, was, not, ready, for, the, grueling, journey, ahead, in, his, infancy, he, was, later, adopted, by, askari, mirza, for, a, change, humayun, was, not, deceived, in, the, character, of, the, man, on, whom, he, has, pinned, his, hopes, emir, hussein, umrani, ruler, of, sindh, welcomed, humayun, s, presence, and, was, loyal, to, him, just, as, he, had, been, loyal, to, babur, against, the, renegade, arghuns, while, in, sindh, humayun, alongside, hussein, umrani, gathered, horses, and, weapons, and, formed, new, alliances, that, helped, regain, lost, territories, until, finally, humayun, had, gathered, hundreds, of, sindhi, and, baloch, tribesmen, alongside, his, mughals, and, then, marched, towards, kandahar, and, later, kabul, thousands, more, gathered, by, his, side, as, humayun, continually, declared, himself, the, rightful, timurid, heir, of, the, first, mughal, emperor, babur, after, humayun, set, out, from, his, expedition, in, sindh, along, with, 300, camels, mostly, wild, and, 2000, loads, of, grain, he, set, off, to, join, his, brothers, in, kandahar, after, crossing, the, indus, river, on, 11, july, 1543, along, with, the, ambition, to, regain, the, mughal, empire, and, overthrow, the, suri, dynasty, among, the, tribes, that, had, sworn, allegiance, to, humayun, were, the, leghari, magsi, rind, and, many, others, in, kamran, mirza, s, territory, hindal, mirza, had, been, placed, under, house, arrest, in, kabul, after, refusing, to, have, the, khutba, recited, in, kamran, mirza, s, name, his, other, brother, askari, mirza, was, now, ordered, to, gather, an, army, and, march, on, humayun, when, humayun, received, word, of, the, approaching, hostile, army, he, decided, against, facing, them, and, instead, sought, refuge, elsewhere, akbar, was, left, behind, in, camp, close, to, kandahar, as, it, was, december, too, cold, and, dangerous, to, include, the, 14, month, old, toddler, in, the, march, through, the, mountains, of, the, hindu, kush, askari, mirza, took, akbar, in, leaving, the, wives, of, kamran, and, askari, mirza, to, raise, him, the, akbarnama, specifies, kamran, mirza, s, wife, sultan, begam, once, again, humayun, turned, toward, kandahar, where, his, brother, kamran, mirza, was, in, power, but, he, received, no, help, and, had, to, seek, refuge, with, the, shah, of, persia, humayun, fled, to, the, refuge, of, the, safavid, empire, in, persia, marching, with, 40, men, his, wife, bega, begum, and, her, companion, through, mountains, and, valleys, among, other, trials, the, imperial, party, were, forced, to, live, on, horse, meat, boiled, in, the, soldiers, helmets, these, indignities, continued, during, the, month, it, took, them, to, reach, herat, however, after, their, arrival, they, were, reintroduced, to, the, finer, things, in, life, upon, entering, the, city, his, army, was, greeted, with, an, armed, escort, and, they, were, treated, to, lavish, food, and, clothing, they, were, given, fine, accommodations, and, the, roads, were, cleared, and, cleaned, before, them, the, shah, tahmasp, i, unlike, humayun, s, own, family, actually, welcomed, the, mughal, and, treated, him, as, a, royal, visitor, here, humayun, went, sightseeing, and, was, amazed, at, the, persian, artwork, and, architecture, he, saw, much, of, this, was, the, work, of, the, timurid, sultan, husayn, bayqarah, and, his, ancestor, princess, gauhar, shad, thus, he, was, able, to, admire, the, work, of, his, relatives, and, ancestors, at, first, hand, the, mughal, monarch, was, introduced, to, the, work, of, the, persian, miniaturists, and, kamaleddin, behzad, sent, two, of, his, pupils, to, join, humayun, s, court, humayun, was, amazed, by, their, work, and, asked, if, they, would, serve, him, if, he, regained, the, sovereignty, of, hindustan, they, agreed, with, so, much, happening, humayun, did, not, meet, tahmasp, until, july, six, months, after, his, arrival, in, persia, after, a, lengthy, journey, from, herat, the, two, met, in, qazvin, where, a, large, feast, and, parties, were, held, for, the, event, the, meeting, of, the, two, emperors, is, depicted, in, a, famous, wall, painting, in, the, chehel, sotoun, forty, columns, palace, in, esfahan, tahmasp, urged, that, humayun, convert, from, sunni, to, shia, islam, in, order, to, keep, himself, and, several, hundred, followers, alive, although, the, mughals, initially, disagreed, to, their, conversion, they, knew, that, with, this, outward, acceptance, of, shi, ism, tahmasp, was, eventually, prepared, to, offer, humayun, more, substantial, support, when, humayun, s, brother, kamran, mirza, offered, to, cede, kandahar, to, the, persians, in, exchange, for, humayun, dead, or, alive, tahmasp, refused, instead, he, staged, a, celebration, with, 300, tents, an, imperial, persian, carpet, 12, musical, bands, and, meat, of, all, kinds, here, the, shah, announced, that, all, this, and, 12, 000, elite, cavalry, were, humayun, s, to, lead, an, attack, on, kamran, all, that, tahmasp, asked, for, was, that, if, humayun, s, forces, were, victorious, kandahar, would, be, his, with, this, persian, safavid, aid, humayun, took, kandahar, from, askari, mirza, after, a, two, week, siege, he, noted, how, the, nobles, who, had, served, askari, mirza, quickly, flocked, to, serve, him, in, very, truth, the, greater, part, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, world, are, like, a, flock, of, sheep, wherever, one, goes, the, others, immediately, follow, kandahar, was, as, agreed, given, to, the, shah, of, persia, who, sent, his, infant, son, murad, as, the, viceroy, however, the, baby, soon, died, and, humayun, thought, himself, strong, enough, to, assume, power, humayun, now, prepared, to, take, kabul, ruled, by, his, brother, kamran, mirza, in, the, end, there, was, no, actual, siege, kamran, mirza, was, detested, as, a, leader, and, as, humayun, s, persian, army, approached, the, city, hundreds, of, the, former, s, troops, changed, sides, flocking, to, join, humayun, and, swelling, his, ranks, kamran, mirza, absconded, and, began, building, an, army, outside, the, city, in, november, 1545, hamida, and, humayun, were, reunited, with, their, son, akbar, and, held, a, huge, feast, they, also, held, another, feast, in, the, child, s, honour, when, he, was, circumcised, however, while, humayun, had, a, larger, army, than, kamran, mirza, and, had, the, upper, hand, on, two, occasions, his, poor, military, judgement, allowed, the, latter, to, retake, kabul, and, kandahar, forcing, humayun, to, mount, further, campaigns, for, their, recapture, he, might, have, been, aided, by, his, reputation, for, leniency, towards, the, troops, who, had, defended, the, cities, against, him, unlike, kamran, mirza, whose, brief, periods, of, possession, were, marked, by, atrocities, against, the, inhabitants, whom, he, believed, had, helped, his, brother, his, youngest, brother, hindal, mirza, formerly, the, most, disloyal, of, his, siblings, died, fighting, on, his, behalf, his, brother, askari, mirza, was, shackled, in, chains, at, the, behest, of, his, nobles, and, aides, he, was, allowed, go, on, hajj, and, died, en, route, in, the, desert, outside, damascus, humayun, s, other, brother, kamran, mirza, had, repeatedly, sought, to, have, him, killed, in, 1552, kamran, mirza, attempted, to, make, a, pact, with, islam, shah, sher, shah, s, successor, but, was, apprehended, by, a, gakhar, the, gakhars, were, one, of, the, minority, of, tribal, groups, who, had, consistently, remained, loyal, to, their, oath, to, the, mughals, sultan, adam, of, the, gakhars, handed, kamran, mirza, over, to, humayun, humayun, though, inclined, to, forgive, kamran, mirza, was, warned, that, allowing, his, brother, s, repeated, acts, of, treachery, to, go, unpunished, could, foment, rebellion, amongst, his, own, supporters, so, instead, of, killing, kamran, mirza, humayun, had, him, blinded, thereby, ending, any, claim, by, the, latter, to, the, throne, he, then, sent, kamran, mirza, on, hajj, as, he, hoped, to, see, his, brother, thereby, absolved, of, his, offences, however, kamran, mirza, died, close, to, mecca, in, the,
