the, battle, became, a, stalemate, during, this, time, zhuge, liang, made, several, attempts, to, lure, sima, yi, to, attack, him, on, one, occasion, he, sent, women, s, ornaments, to, sima, yi, to, taunt, him, an, apparently, angry, sima, yi, sought, permission, from, cao, rui, to, attack, the, enemy, but, was, denied, cao, rui, even, sent, xin, pi, as, his, special, representative, to, the, frontline, to, ensure, that, sima, yi, followed, orders, and, remained, in, camp, zhuge, liang, knew, that, sima, yi, was, pretending, to, be, angry, because, he, wanted, to, show, the, wei, soldiers, that, he, would, not, put, up, with, zhuge, liang, s, taunting, and, to, ensure, that, his, men, were, ready, for, battle, during, the, stalemate, when, zhuge, liang, sent, a, messenger, to, meet, sima, yi, sima, yi, asked, the, messenger, about, zhuge, liang, s, daily, routine, and, living, conditions, the, messenger, said, that, zhuge, liang, consumed, three, to, four, sheng, of, grain, a, day, and, that, he, micromanaged, almost, everything, except, trivial, issues, like, punishments, for, minor, offences, after, hearing, this, sima, yi, remarked, how, can, zhuge, kongming, expect, to, last, long, he, s, going, to, die, soon, the, stalemate, at, the, wuzhang, plains, lasted, for, over, 100, days, sometime, between, 11, september, and, 10, october, 234, zhuge, liang, became, critically, ill, and, died, in, camp, he, was, 54, by, east, asian, age, reckoning, at, the, time, of, his, death, sun, sheng, s, jin, yangqiu, recorded, the, following, account, a, glowing, red, meteorite, fell, from, the, sky, along, the, northeast, to, southwest, direction, towards, zhuge, liang, s, camp, bounced, off, the, ground, and, landed, again, three, times, expanding, in, size, when, it, bounced, off, and, shrinking, in, size, as, it, landed, zhuge, liang, died, shortly, after, the, book, of, wei, and, han, jin, chunqiu, gave, different, accounts, of, where, zhuge, liang, died, the, former, recorded, that, zhuge, liang, vomited, blood, in, frustration, when, his, army, ran, out, of, supplies, during, the, stalemate, and, he, ordered, his, troops, to, burn, down, their, camp, and, retreat, into, a, valley, where, he, fell, sick, and, died, the, latter, recorded, that, he, died, in, the, residence, of, a, certain, guo, family, in, his, annotations, to, zhuge, liang, s, biography, pei, songzhi, pointed, out, that, the, wei, shu, and, han, jin, chunqiu, accounts, were, wrong, and, that, zhuge, liang, actually, died, in, camp, at, the, wuzhang, plains, he, also, rebutted, the, wei, shu, account, as, follows, it, was, unclear, from, the, situation, at, the, battle, of, wuzhang, plains, which, side, was, winning, and, which, side, was, losing, the, wei, shu, was, exaggerating, when, it, said, that, zhuge, liang, vomited, blood, given, kongming, s, brilliance, was, it, likely, for, him, to, vomit, blood, because, of, zhongda, this, exaggeration, originated, from, a, note, written, by, emperor, yuan, of, jin, which, said, zhuge, liang, lost, the, battle, and, vomited, blood, the, reason, why, the, wei, shu, said, that, zhuge, liang, died, in, a, valley, was, because, the, shu, army, only, released, news, of, zhuge, liang, s, death, after, they, entered, the, valley, when, sima, yi, heard, from, civilians, that, zhuge, liang, had, died, from, illness, and, the, shu, army, had, burnt, down, their, camp, and, retreated, he, led, his, troops, in, pursuit, and, caught, up, with, them, the, shu, forces, on, yang, yi, and, jiang, wei, s, command, turned, around, and, readied, themselves, for, battle, sima, yi, pulled, back, his, troops, and, retreated, some, days, later, while, surveying, the, remains, of, the, shu, camp, sima, yi, remarked, what, a, genius, he, was, based, on, his, observations, that, the, shu, army, made, a, hasty, retreat, he, concluded, that, zhuge, liang, had, indeed, died, so, he, led, his, troops, in, pursuit, again, when, sima, yi, reached, chi, an, he, asked, the, civilians, living, there, about, zhuge, liang, and, heard, that, there, was, a, recent, popular, saying, a, dead, zhuge, liang, scares, away, a, living, zhongda, he, laughed, and, said, i, can, predict, the, thoughts, of, the, living, but, i, can, t, predict, the, dead, s, before, his, death, zhuge, liang, said, that, he, wanted, to, be, buried, as, simply, as, possible, in, mount, dingjun, in, present, day, mian, county, hanzhong, shaanxi, his, tomb, should, be, just, large, enough, for, his, coffin, to, fit, in, he, was, to, be, dressed, in, the, clothes, he, wore, when, he, died, he, did, not, need, to, be, buried, with, any, decorative, objects, or, ornaments, liu, shan, issued, an, imperial, edict, to, mourn, and, eulogise, zhuge, liang, as, well, as, to, confer, on, him, the, posthumous, title, marquis, zhongwu, loyal, martial, marquis, zhuge, liang, once, wrote, a, memorial, to, liu, shan, as, follows, and, kept, his, promise, until, his, death, i, have, 800, mulberry, trees, and, 15, qing, of, farmland, in, chengdu, and, my, family, have, more, than, enough, to, feed, and, clothe, themselves, when, i, am, away, from, chengdu, on, assignment, i, do, not, incur, any, excess, expenses, i, depend, solely, on, my, official, salary, for, my, personal, expenses, i, do, not, run, any, private, enterprises, to, generate, additional, income, if, i, have, any, excess, silk, and, wealth, at, the, time, of, my, death, i, would, have, let, your, majesty, down, in, the, spring, of, 263, liu, shan, ordered, a, memorial, temple, for, zhuge, liang, to, be, built, in, mianyang, county, present, day, mian, county, shaanxi, initially, when, zhuge, liang, died, in, 234, many, people, wanted, the, shu, government, to, build, memorial, temple, to, honour, him, however, after, some, discussion, the, government, decided, not, to, because, it, was, not, in, accordance, with, confucian, rules, of, propriety, in, his, works, sima, guang, noted, that, during, the, han, era, only, emperors, were, worshiped, at, temples, with, no, official, channels, to, worship, zhuge, liang, the, people, took, to, holding, their, own, private, memorial, services, for, zhuge, liang, on, special, occasions, some, time, later, some, people, pointed, out, that, it, was, appropriate, to, build, a, memorial, temple, for, zhuge, liang, in, chengdu, but, the, shu, emperor, liu, shan, refused, two, officials, xi, long, and, xiang, chong, then, wrote, a, memorial, to, liu, shan, and, managed, to, convince, him, to, build, the, memorial, temple, in, mianyang, county, in, the, autumn, of, 263, during, the, wei, invasion, of, shu, the, wei, general, zhong, hui, passed, by, zhuge, liang, s, memorial, temple, in, mianyang, county, along, the, way, and, paid, his, respects, there, he, also, ordered, his, troops, to, refrain, from, farming, and, logging, anywhere, near, zhuge, liang, s, tomb, at, mount, dingjun, the, shu, ji, by, wang, yin, recorded, that, sometime, in, the, early, jin, dynasty, sima, jun, 232, 286, the, prince, of, fufeng, once, had, a, discussion, about, zhuge, liang, with, his, subordinates, liu, bao, huan, xi, and, others, many, of, them, brought, up, negative, points, about, zhuge, liang, making, a, bad, choice, when, he, chose, to, serve, under, liu, bei, creating, unnecessary, burden, and, stress, for, the, people, of, shu, being, overly, ambitious, and, lacking, awareness, about, the, limits, of, his, strengths, and, abilities, however, there, was, one, guo, chong, who, dissented, and, argued, that, zhuge, liang, s, brilliance, and, wisdom, exceeded, that, of, guan, zhong, and, yan, ying, he, then, shared, five, anecdotes, about, zhuge, liang, which, he, claimed, nobody, had, heard, of, liu, bao, huan, xi, and, the, others, fell, silent, after, hearing, the, five, anecdotes, sima, jun, even, generously, endorsed, the, five, anecdotes, by, guo, chong, pei, songzhi, when, annotating, zhuge, liang, s, official, biography, in, the, sanguozhi, found, the, five, anecdotes, unreliable, and, questionable, but, he, still, added, them, into, zhuge, liang, s, biography, and, pointed, out, the, problems, in, each, of, them, in, his, concluding, remarks, pei, songzhi, noted, that, the, fourth, century, historians, sun, sheng, and, xi, zuochi, given, their, attention, to, detail, most, probably, came, across, guo, chong, s, five, anecdotes, while, doing, research, on, the, three, kingdoms, period, he, surmised, that, sun, sheng, and, xi, zuochi, probably, omitted, the, anecdotes, in, their, writings, because, they, like, him, also, found, the, anecdotes, unreliable, and, questionable, in, the, first, anecdote, guo, chong, claimed, that, zhuge, liang, incurred, much, resentment, from, the, people, when, he, implemented, harsh, and, draconian, laws, in, yi, province, covering, present, day, sichuan, and, chongqing, fa, zheng, an, adviser, to, liu, bei, tried, to, dissuade, zhuge, liang, from, doing, so, as, he, believed, that, the, harsh, and, draconian, laws, would, drive, a, wedge, between, the, people, of, yi, province, and, liu, bei, s, government, he, further, pointed, out, that, the, government, lacked, popular, support, and, political, legitimacy, at, the, time, because, some, people, saw, liu, bei, as, a, foreign, invader, who, occupied, yi, province, by, military, force, fa, zheng, then, urged, zhuge, liang, to, relax, the, laws, and, give, the, people, some, breathing, space, in, response, zhuge, liang, argued, that, harsh, laws, were, necessary, to, restore, law, and, order, in, yi, province, and, help, liu, bei, s, government, consolidate, its, control, over, the, territories, and, people, he, blamed, liu, yan, s, soft, rule, and, liu, zhang, s, incompetence, for, allowing, corruption, and, decadence, to, become, deeply, entrenched, in, yi, province, he, also, argued, that, the, best, way, to, set, things, right, was, to, restore, law, and, order, and, to, regulate, the, distribution, of, honours, and, privileges, among, the, population, pei, songzhi, pointed, out, three, problems, in, this, anecdote, first, when, fa, zheng, and, liu, bei, were, still, alive, zhuge, liang, was, never, in, a, position, powerful, enough, for, him, to, implement, such, a, policy, he, would, have, to, be, the, governor, of, yi, province, to, do, so, but, he, only, became, governor, of, yi, province, in, addition, to, other, appointments, during, liu, shan, s, reign, second, as, zhuge, liang, is, known, for, being, a, respectful, humble, and, faithful, subject, it, seemed, totally, out, of, place, for, him, to, advocate, such, a, policy, and, make, such, a, crude, response, to, fa, zheng, third, good, governance, which, zhuge, liang, is, known, for, is, not, normally, associated, with, harsh, laws, in, the, second, anecdote, guo, chong, claimed, that, cao, cao, once, sent, an, assassin, to, kill, liu, bei, when, the, assassin, first, met, liu, bei, he, could, only, speak, to, liu, bei, from, a, distance, so, he, thought, of, a, way, to, attract, liu, bei, s, attention, and, get, up, close, he, started, analysing, the, situation, in, cao, cao, s, domain, and, presented, ideas, to, liu, bei, on, how, to, attack, it, liu, bei, found, his, ideas, interesting, and, asked, him, to, come, closer, just, then, zhuge, liang, came, into, the, meeting, room, and, caused, the, assassin, to, panic, he, noticed, the, assassin, s, facial, expression, and, found, him, suspicious, the, assassin, then, excused, himself, saying, that, he, needed, to, use, the, latrine, liu, bei, told, zhuge, liang, i, found, an, extraordinary, man, who, can, be, a, good, assistant, to, you, when, zhuge, liang, asked, who, it, was, liu, bei, said, the, man, who, just, went, to, the, latrine, zhuge, liang, took, a, deep, breath, and, said, just, now, i, saw, a, look, of, fear, and, panic, on, his, face, his, avoidance, of, eye, contact, and, his, body, language, show, that, he, has, something, evil, on, his, mind, he, must, be, an, assassin, sent, by, cao, cao, liu, bei, immediately, ordered, the, assassin, s, arrest, but, the, assassin, had, already, fled, pei, songzhi, pointed, out, the, problems, in, this, anecdote, if, this, incident, really, happened, the, assassin, must, be, a, great, talent, to, be, able, to, attract, liu, bei, s, attention, and, in, liu, bei, s, opinion, worthy, enough, to, serve, as, an, assistant, to, zhuge, liang, however, this, was, unlikely, because, assassins, were, typically, rough, and, boorish, men, ready, to, sacrifice, their, lives, to, accomplish, their, mission, besides, it, did, not, make, much, sense, for, a, man, of, such, talent, to, be, an, assassin, when, he, could, be, better, off, as, an, adviser, to, any, of, the, great, warlords, moreover, as, cao, cao, was, known, for, respecting, and, cherishing, talents, it, was, unlikely, that, he, would, willingly, sacrifice, someone, of, such, talent, by, sending, him, on, a, risky, mission, furthermore, given, the, significance, of, this, incident, it, should, be, recorded, in, history, but, there, is, no, mention, of, it, in, the, official, histories, guo, chong, s, third, anecdote, concerns, zhuge, liang, s, alleged, use, of, the, empty, fort, strategy, against, sima, yi, at, yangping, in, the, fourth, anecdote, guo, chong, claimed, that, when, zhuge, liang, returned, to, chengdu, after, the, first, northern, expedition, he, received, many, compliments, from, his, colleagues, for, his, successes, in, capturing, a, few, thousand, wei, families, and, making, jiang, wei, defect, to, shu, however, to, their, surprise, zhuge, liang, solemnly, replied, all, the, people, under, heaven, are, people, of, the, han, empire, now, the, han, empire, isn, t, revived, yet, and, the, people, are, still, suffering, from, war, it, will, be, my, fault, even, if, only, one, person, dies, due, to, war, i, dare, not, accept, compliments, built, on, people, s, miseries, the, people, of, shu, then, realised, that, his, goal, was, to, vanquish, wei, rather, than, simply, expanding, shu, s, borders, through, conquests, pei, songzhi, pointed, out, that, zhuge, liang, s, goal, of, achieving, a, complete, victory, over, wei, was, already, well, known, before, he, went, on, the, first, northern, expedition, so, it, seemed, very, odd, for, guo, chong, to, say, that, the, people, of, shu, only, realised, it, after, zhuge, liang, came, back, from, the, first, northern, expedition, he, also, noted, that, the, first, northern, expedition, was, an, overall, failure, so, the, successes, mentioned, in, this, anecdote, neither, made, sense, nor, were, worthy, of, compliments, the, reasons, he, gave, were, as, such, shu, lost, two, battles, against, wei, in, the, first, northern, expedition, and, ultimately, failed, to, conquer, the, three, commanderies, wei, had, nothing, to, lose, from, the, defection, of, jiang, wei, who, at, the, time, was, a, relative, nobody, and, the, capture, of, the, few, thousand, wei, families, was, insufficient, to, make, up, for, the, casualties, the, shu, forces, suffered, at, jieting, and, ji, valley, in, the, fifth, anecdote, guo, chong, claimed, that, during, the, fourth, northern, expedition, when, zhuge, liang, led, shu, forces, to, attack, mount, qi, the, wei, emperor, cao, rui, decided, to, launch, a, counterattack, on, shu, so, he, personally, led, his, forces, to, chang, an, he, then, ordered, sima, yi, and, zhang, he, to, lead, 300, 000, elite, wei, soldiers, from, yong, and, liang, provinces, on, a, covert, operation, deep, into, shu, territory, and, launch, a, stealth, attack, on, jiange, in, present, day, jiange, county, sichuan, a, strategic, mountain, pass, around, the, time, zhuge, liang, had, set, up, a, rotating, shift, system, in, which, at, any, time, 20, percent, of, his, troops, about, 80, 000, men, would, be, stationed, at, mount, qi, while, the, remaining, 80, percent, would, remain, behind, as, the, wei, forces, approached, mount, qi, and, prepared, to, attack, the, shu, positions, zhuge, liang, s, subordinates, urged, him, to, stop, the, rotating, shift, system, and, concentrate, all, the, shu, forces, together, to, resist, the, numerically, superior, wei, forces, zhuge, liang, replied, when, i, lead, the, troops, into, battle, i, operate, on, the, basis, of, trust, even, the, ancients, felt, it, was, a, shame, for, one, to, betray, others, trust, in, him, in, order, to, achieve, his, goals, the, soldiers, who, are, due, to, return, home, can, pack, up, their, belongings, and, prepare, to, leave, their, wives, have, been, counting, the, days, and, looking, forward, to, their, husbands, coming, home, even, though, we, are, in, a, difficult, and, dangerous, situation, now, we, shouldn, t, break, our, earlier, promise, when, the, homebound, soldiers, heard, that, they, were, allowed, to, go, home, their, morale, shot, up, and, they, became, more, motivated, to, stay, back, and, fight, the, wei, forces, before, going, home, they, talked, among, themselves, and, pledged, to, use, their, lives, to, repay, zhuge, liang, s, kindness, later, during, the, battle, they, fought, fiercely, and, killed, zhang, he, and, forced, sima, yi, to, retreat, zhuge, liang, won, the, battle, because, he, successfully, gained, the, trust, of, the, shu, soldiers, pei, songzhi, pointed, out, that, this, anecdote, contradicted, the, accounts, from, historical, records, during, the, fourth, northern, expedition, cao, rui, was, indeed, at, chang, an, but, he, did, not, personally, lead, wei, forces, into, battle, as, for, the, part, about, cao, rui, ordering, sima, yi, and, zhang, he, to, lead, a, 300, 000, strong, army, to, attack, jiange, pei, songzhi, argued, that, it, never, happened, because, it, was, extremely, unlikely, for, such, a, large, army, to, pass, through, the, guanzhong, region, bypass, zhuge, liang, s, position, at, mount, qi, and, enter, shu, territory, completely, undetected, he, also, found, the, part, about, the, rotating, shift, system, untrue, because, it, was, impossible, for, a, shu, expeditionary, force, to, enter, wei, territory, and, remain, there, for, so, long, much, less, set, up, a, rotating, shift, system, zhuge, liang, married, the, daughter, of, huang, chengyan, a, reclusive, scholar, living, south, of, the, han, river, the, xiangyang, ji, recorded, that, huang, chengyan, once, asked, zhuge, liang, i, heard, you, are, looking, for, a, wife, i, have, an, ugly, daughter, with, yellow, hair, and, dark, skin, but, her, talent, matches, yours, zhuge,
