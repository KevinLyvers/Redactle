his, uncle, emperor, alexander, i, died, childless, grand, duke, konstantin, the, next, younger, brother, of, alexander, i, had, previously, renounced, his, rights, to, the, throne, of, russia, thus, alexander, s, father, who, was, the, third, son, of, paul, i, became, the, new, emperor, he, took, the, name, nicholas, i, at, that, time, alexander, became, tsesarevich, as, his, father, s, heir, to, the, throne, in, the, period, of, his, life, as, heir, apparent, 1825, to, 1855, the, intellectual, atmosphere, of, saint, petersburg, did, not, favour, any, kind, of, change, freedom, of, thought, and, all, forms, of, private, initiative, were, suppressed, vigorously, by, the, order, of, his, father, personal, and, official, censorship, was, rife, criticism, of, the, authorities, was, regarded, as, a, serious, offence, the, education, of, the, tsesarevich, as, future, emperor, took, place, under, the, supervision, of, the, liberal, romantic, poet, and, gifted, translator, vasily, zhukovsky,

the, first, romanov, heir, to, visit, siberia, 1837, while, touring, russia, he, also, befriended, the, then, exiled, poet, alexander, herzen, and, pardoned, him, it, was, through, herzen, s, influence, that, he, later, abolished, serfdom, in, russia, in, 1839, when, his, parents, sent, him, on, a, tour, of, europe, he, met, twenty, year, old, queen, victoria, and, they, became, acquainted, simon, sebag, montefiore, speculates, that, a, small, romance, emerged, such, a, marriage, however, would, not, work, as, alexander, was, not, a, minor, prince, of, europe, and, was, in, line, to, inherit, a, throne, himself, in, 1847, alexander, donated, money, to, ireland, during, the, great, famine, he, has, been, described, as, looking, like, a, german, somewhat, of, a, pacifist, a, heavy, smoker, and, card, player, the, death, of, his, father, gave, alexander, a, diplomatic, headache, for, his, father, was, engaged, in, open, warfare, in, the, southwest, of, his, empire, on, 15, january, 1856, the, new, tsar, took, russia, out, of, the, crimean, war, on, the, very, unfavourable, terms, of, the, treaty, of, paris, 1856, which, included, the, loss, of, the, black, sea, fleet, and, the, provision, that, the, black, sea, was, to, be, a, demilitarized, zone, similar, to, a, contemporaneous, region, of, the, baltic, sea, this, gave, him, room, to, breathe, and, pursue, an, ambitious, plan, of, domestic, reforms, encouraged, by, public, opinion, alexander, began, a, period, of, radical, reforms, including, an, attempt, not, to, depend, on, landed, aristocracy, controlling, the, poor, an, effort, to, develop, russia, s, natural, resources, and, to, reform, all, branches, of, the, administration, boris, chicherin, 1828, 1904, was, a, political, philosopher, who, believed, that, russia, needed, a, strong, authoritative, government, by, alexander, to, make, the, reforms, possible, he, praised, alexander, for, the, range, of, his, fundamental, reforms, arguing, that, the, tsar, was, called, upon, to, execute, one, of, the, hardest, tasks, which, can, confront, an, autocratic, ruler, to, completely, remodel, the, enormous, state, which, had, been, entrusted, to, his, care, to, abolish, an, age, old, order, founded, on, slavery, to, replace, it, with, civic, decency, and, freedom, to, establish, justice, in, a, country, which, had, never, known, the, meaning, of, legality, to, redesign, the, entire, administration, to, introduce, freedom, of, the, press, in, the, context, of, untrammeled, authority, to, call, new, forces, to, life, at, every, turn, and, set, them, on, firm, legal, foundations, to, put, a, repressed, and, humiliated, society, on, its, feet, and, to, give, it, the, chance, to, flex, its, muscles, alexander, ii, succeeded, to, the, throne, upon, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1855, as, tsesarevich, he, had, been, an, enthusiastic, supporter, of, his, father, s, reactionary, policies, that, is, he, always, obeyed, the, autocratic, ruler, but, now, he, was, the, autocratic, ruler, himself, and, fully, intended, to, rule, according, to, what, he, thought, best, he, rejected, any, moves, to, set, up, a, parliamentary, system, that, would, curb, his, powers, he, inherited, a, large, mess, that, had, been, wrought, by, his, father, s, fear, of, progress, during, his, reign, many, of, the, other, royal, families, of, europe, had, also, disliked, nicholas, i, which, extended, to, distrust, of, the, romanov, dynasty, itself, even, so, there, was, no, one, more, prepared, to, bring, the, country, around, than, alexander, ii, the, first, year, of, his, reign, was, devoted, to, the, prosecution, of, the, crimean, war, and, after, the, fall, of, sevastopol, to, negotiations, for, peace, led, by, his, trusted, counsellor, prince, alexander, gorchakov, the, country, had, been, exhausted, and, humiliated, by, the, war, bribe, taking, theft, and, corruption, were, rampant, the, emancipation, reform, of, 1861, abolished, serfdom, on, private, estates, throughout, the, russian, empire, by, this, edict, more, than, 23, million, people, received, their, liberty, serfs, gained, the, full, rights, of, free, citizens, including, rights, to, marry, without, having, to, gain, consent, to, own, property, and, to, own, a, business, the, measure, was, the, first, and, most, important, of, the, liberal, reforms, made, by, alexander, ii, polish, landed, proprietors, of, the, lithuanian, provinces, presented, a, petition, hoping, that, their, relations, with, the, serfs, might, be, regulated, in, a, way, more, satisfactory, for, the, proprietors, alexander, ii, authorized, the, formation, of, committees, for, ameliorating, the, condition, of, the, peasants, and, laid, down, the, principles, on, which, the, amelioration, was, to, be, effected, without, consulting, his, ordinary, advisers, alexander, ordered, the, minister, of, the, interior, to, send, a, circular, to, the, provincial, governors, of, european, russia, serfdom, was, rare, in, other, parts, containing, a, copy, of, the, instructions, forwarded, to, the, governor, general, of, lithuania, praising, the, supposed, generous, patriotic, intentions, of, the, lithuanian, landed, proprietors, and, suggesting, that, perhaps, the, landed, proprietors, of, other, provinces, might, express, a, similar, desire, the, hint, was, taken, in, all, provinces, where, serfdom, existed, emancipation, committees, were, formed, emancipation, was, not, a, simple, goal, capable, of, being, achieved, instantaneously, by, imperial, decree, it, contained, complicated, problems, deeply, affecting, the, economic, social, and, political, future, of, the, nation, alexander, had, to, choose, between, the, different, measures, recommended, to, him, and, decide, if, the, serfs, would, become, agricultural, laborers, dependent, economically, and, administratively, on, the, landlords, or, if, the, serfs, would, be, transformed, into, a, class, of, independent, communal, proprietors, the, emperor, gave, his, support, to, the, latter, project, and, the, russian, peasantry, became, one, of, the, last, groups, of, peasants, in, europe, to, shake, off, serfdom, the, architects, of, the, emancipation, manifesto, were, alexander, s, brother, konstantin, yakov, rostovtsev, and, nikolay, milyutin, on, 3, march, 1861, six, years, after, his, accession, the, emancipation, law, was, signed, and, published, a, host, of, new, reforms, followed, in, diverse, areas, the, tsar, appointed, dmitry, milyutin, to, carry, out, significant, reforms, in, the, russian, armed, forces, further, important, changes, were, made, concerning, industry, and, commerce, and, the, new, freedom, thus, afforded, produced, a, large, number, of, limited, liability, companies, plans, were, formed, for, building, a, great, network, of, railways, partly, to, develop, the, natural, resources, of, the, country, and, partly, to, increase, its, power, for, defense, and, attack, military, reforms, included, universal, conscription, introduced, for, all, social, classes, on, 1, january, 1874, prior, to, the, new, regulation, as, of, 1861, conscription, was, compulsorily, enforced, only, for, the, peasantry, conscription, had, been, 25, years, for, serfs, who, were, drafted, by, their, landowners, which, was, widely, considered, to, be, a, life, sentence, other, military, reforms, included, extending, the, reserve, forces, and, the, military, district, system, which, split, the, russian, states, into, 15, military, districts, a, system, still, in, use, over, a, hundred, years, later, the, building, of, strategic, railways, and, an, emphasis, on, the, military, education, of, the, officer, corps, comprised, further, reforms, corporal, punishment, in, the, military, and, branding, of, soldiers, as, punishment, were, banned, the, bulk, of, important, military, reforms, were, enacted, as, a, result, of, the, poor, showing, in, the, crimean, war, a, new, judicial, administration, 1864, based, on, the, french, model, introduced, security, of, tenure, a, new, penal, code, and, a, greatly, simplified, system, of, civil, and, criminal, procedure, also, came, into, operation, reorganisation, of, the, judiciary, occurred, to, include, trial, in, open, court, with, judges, appointed, for, life, a, jury, system, and, the, creation, of, justices, of, the, peace, to, deal, with, minor, offences, at, local, level, legal, historian, sir, henry, maine, credited, alexander, ii, with, the, first, great, attempt, since, the, time, of, grotius, to, codify, and, humanise, the, usages, of, war, alexander, s, bureaucracy, instituted, an, elaborate, scheme, of, local, self, government, zemstvo, for, the, rural, districts, 1864, and, the, large, towns, 1870, with, elective, assemblies, possessing, a, restricted, right, of, taxation, and, a, new, rural, and, municipal, police, under, the, direction, of, the, minister, of, the, interior, under, alexander, s, rules, jews, could, not, own, land, and, were, restricted, in, travel, however, special, taxes, on, jews, were, eliminated, and, those, who, graduated, from, secondary, school, were, permitted, to, live, outside, the, pale, of, settlement, and, became, eligible, for, state, employment, large, numbers, of, educated, jews, moved, as, soon, as, possible, to, moscow, saint, petersburg, and, other, major, cities, the, alaska, colony, was, losing, money, and, would, be, impossible, to, defend, in, wartime, against, britain, so, in, 1867, russia, sold, alaska, to, the, united, states, for, 7, 2, million, equivalent, to, 157, million, in, 2023, the, russian, administrators, soldiers, settlers, and, some, of, the, priests, returned, home, others, stayed, to, minister, to, their, native, parishioners, who, remain, members, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, into, the, 21st, century, alexander, maintained, a, generally, liberal, course, radicals, complained, he, did, not, go, far, enough, and, he, became, a, target, for, numerous, assassination, plots, he, survived, attempts, that, took, place, in, 1866, 1879, and, 1880, finally, 13, march, 1881, assassins, organized, by, the, narodnaya, volya, people, s, will, party, killed, him, with, a, bomb, the, emperor, had, earlier, in, the, day, signed, the, loris, melikov, constitution, which, would, have, created, two, legislative, commissions, made, up, of, indirectly, elected, representatives, had, it, not, been, repealed, by, his, reactionary, successor, alexander, iii, an, attempted, assassination, in, 1866, started, a, more, conservative, period, that, lasted, until, his, death, the, tsar, made, a, series, of, new, appointments, replacing, liberal, ministers, with, conservatives, under, minister, of, education, dmitry, tolstoy, liberal, university, courses, and, subjects, that, encouraged, critical, thinking, were, replaced, by, a, more, traditional, curriculum, and, from, 1871, onwards, only, students, from, gymnasiums, could, progress, to, university, in, 1879, governor, generals, were, established, with, powers, to, prosecute, in, military, courts, and, exile, political, offenders, the, government, also, held, show, trials, with, the, intention, of, deterring, others, from, revolutionary, activity, but, after, cases, such, as, the, trial, of, the, 193, where, sympathetic, juries, acquitted, many, of, the, defendants, this, was, abandoned, after, alexander, ii, became, emperor, of, russia, and, king, of, poland, in, 1855, he, substantially, relaxed, the, strict, and, repressive, regime, that, had, been, imposed, on, congress, poland, after, the, november, uprising, of, 1830, 1831, however, in, 1856, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, alexander, made, a, memorable, speech, to, the, deputies, of, the, polish, nobility, who, inhabited, congress, poland, western, ukraine, lithuania, livonia, and, belarus, in, which, he, warned, against, further, concessions, with, the, words, gentlemen, let, us, have, no, dreams, this, served, as, a, warning, to, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, the, territories, of, the, former, poland, lithuania, were, excluded, from, liberal, policies, introduced, by, alexander, the, result, was, the, january, uprising, of, 1863, 1864, that, was, suppressed, after, eighteen, months, of, fighting, hundreds, of, poles, were, executed, and, thousands, were, deported, to, siberia, the, price, of, suppression, was, russian, support, for, the, unification, of, germany, the, martial, law, in, lithuania, introduced, in, 1863, lasted, for, the, next, 40, years, native, languages, ukrainian, and, belarusian, were, completely, banned, from, printed, texts, the, ems, ukase, being, an, example, the, authorities, banned, use, of, the, latin, script, for, writing, lithuanian, the, polish, language, was, banned, in, both, oral, and, written, form, from, all, provinces, except, congress, poland, where, it, was, allowed, in, private, conversations, only, nikolay, milyutin, was, installed, as, governor, and, he, decided, that, the, best, response, to, the, january, uprising, was, to, make, reforms, regarding, the, peasants, he, devised, a, program, which, involved, the, emancipation, of, the, peasantry, at, the, expense, of, the, nationalist, szlachta, landowners, and, the, expulsion, of, roman, catholic, priests, from, schools, emancipation, of, the, polish, peasantry, from, their, serf, like, status, took, place, in, 1864, on, more, generous, terms, than, the, emancipation, of, russian, peasants, in, 1861, in, 1863, alexander, ii, re, convened, the, diet, of, finland, and, initiated, several, reforms, increasing, finland, s, autonomy, within, the, russian, empire, including, establishment, of, its, own, currency, the, finnish, markka, liberation, of, business, led, to, increased, foreign, investment, and, industrial, development, finland, also, got, its, first, railways, separately, established, under, finnish, administration, finally, the, elevation, of, finnish, from, a, language, of, the, common, people, to, a, national, language, equal, to, swedish, opened, opportunities, for, a, larger, proportion, of, finnish, society, alexander, ii, is, still, regarded, as, the, good, tsar, in, finland, these, reforms, could, be, seen, as, results, of, a, genuine, belief, that, reforms, were, easier, to, test, in, an, underpopulated, homogeneous, country, than, in, the, whole, of, russia, they, may, also, be, seen, as, a, reward, for, the, loyalty, of, its, relatively, western, oriented, population, during, the, crimean, war, and, during, the, polish, uprising, encouraging, finnish, nationalism, and, language, can, also, be, seen, as, an, attempt, to, dilute, ties, with, sweden, during, the, crimean, war, austria, maintained, a, policy, of, hostile, neutrality, towards, russia, and, while, not, going, to, war, was, supportive, of, the, anglo, french, coalition, having, abandoned, its, alliance, with, russia, austria, was, diplomatically, isolated, following, the, war, which, contributed, to, russia, s, non, intervention, in, the, 1859, franco, austrian, war, which, meant, the, end, of, austrian, influence, in, italy, and, in, the, 1866, austro, prussian, war, with, the, loss, of, its, influence, in, most, german, speaking, lands, during, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, russia, supported, the, union, largely, due, to, the, view, that, the, u, s, served, as, a, counterbalance, to, their, geopolitical, rival, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, in, 1863, the, russian, navy, s, baltic, and, pacific, fleets, wintered, in, the, american, ports, of, new, york, and, san, francisco, respectively, the, treaty, of, paris, of, 1856, stood, until, 1871, when, prussia, defeated, france, in, the, franco, prussian, war, during, his, reign, napoleon, iii, eager, for, the, support, of, the, united, kingdom, had, opposed, russia, over, the, eastern, question, france, abandoned, its, opposition, to, russia, after, the, establishment, of, the, french, third, republic, encouraged, by, the, new, attitude, of, french, diplomacy, and, supported, by, the, german, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, russia, renounced, the, black, sea, clauses, of, the, paris, treaty, agreed, to, in, 1856, as, the, united, kingdom, with, austria, could, not, enforce, the, clauses, russia, once, again, established, a, fleet, in, the, black, sea, france, after, the, franco, prussian, war, and, the, loss, of, alsace, lorraine, was, fervently, hostile, to, germany, and, maintained, friendly, relations, with, russia, in, the, russo, turkish, war, 1877, 1878, the, states, of, romania, serbia, and,

russian, victory, during, alexander, ii, s, rule, just, before, the, conclusion, of, the, war, the, russian, army, under, the, emperor, s, order, implemented, the, mass, killings, and, extermination, of, circassian, mountaineers, in, the, circassian, genocide, which, would, be, often, referred, to, as, cleansing, and, genocide, in, several, historic, dialogues, in, 1857, dmitry, milyutin, first, published, the, idea, of, mass, expulsions, of, circassian, natives, milyutin, argued, that, the, goal, was, not, to, simply, move, them, so, that, their, land, could, be, settled, by, productive, farmers, but, rather, that, eliminating, the, circassians, was, to, be, an, end, in, itself, to, cleanse, the, land, of, hostile, elements, tsar, alexander, ii, endorsed, the, plans, a, large, portion, of, indigenous, muslim, peoples, of, the, region, were, ethnically, cleansed, from, their, homeland, at, the, end, of, the, russo, circassian, war, by, russia, a, large, deportation,

emperor, alexander, ii, started, diplomatic, preparations, with, the, other, great, powers, to, secure, their, neutrality, in, case, of, a, war, between, russia, and, the, ottomans, alexander, ii,

mien, and, manners, are, gracious, and, graceful, but, the, expression, of, his, countenance, which, i, could, now, very, closely, examine, is, sad, whether, it, is, satiety, or, the, loneliness, of, despotism, or, fear, of, a, violent, death, i, know, not, but, it, was, a, visage, of, i, should, think, habitual, mournfulness, in, 1866, alexander, ii, took, a, mistress, catherine, dolgorukova,
