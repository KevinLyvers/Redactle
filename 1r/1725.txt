heinrich, hermann, robert, koch, k, x, kokh, german, 11, december, 1843, 27, may, 1910, was, a, german, physician, and, microbiologist, as, the, discoverer, of, the, specific, causative, agents, of, deadly, infectious, diseases, including, tuberculosis, cholera, and, anthrax, he, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, main, founders, of, modern, bacteriology, as, such, he, is, popularly, nicknamed, the, father, of, microbiology, with, louis, pasteur, and, as, the, father, of, medical, bacteriology, his, discovery, of, the, anthrax, bacterium, bacillus, anthracis, in, 1876, is, considered, as, the, birth, of, modern, bacteriology, koch, used, his, discoveries, to, establish, that, germs, could, cause, a, specific, disease, and, directly, provided, proofs, for, the, germ, theory, of, diseases, therefore, creating, the, scientific, basis, of, public, health, saving, millions, of, lives, for, his, life, s, work, koch, is, seen, as, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, medicine, while, working, as, a, private, physician, koch, developed, many, innovative, techniques, in, microbiology, he, was, the, first, to, use, the, oil, immersion, lens, condenser, and, microphotography, in, microscopy, his, invention, of, the, bacterial, culture, method, using, agar, and, glass, plates, later, developed, as, the, petri, dish, by, his, assistant, julius, richard, petri, made, him, the, first, to, grow, bacteria, in, the, laboratory, in, appreciation, of, his, work, he, was, appointed, to, government, advisor, at, the, imperial, health, office, in, 1880, promoted, to, a, senior, executive, position, geheimer, regierungsrat, in, 1882, director, of, hygienic, institute, and, chair, professor, of, hygiene, of, the, faculty, of, medicine, at, berlin, university, in, 1885, and, the, royal, prussian, institute, for, infectious, diseases, later, renamed, robert, koch, institute, after, his, death, in, 1891, the, methods, koch, used, in, bacteriology, led, to, the, establishment, of, a, medical, concept, known, as, koch, s, postulates, four, generalized, medical, principles, to, ascertain, the, relationship, of, pathogens, with, specific, diseases, the, concept, is, still, in, use, in, most, situations, and, influences, subsequent, epidemiological, principles, such, as, the, bradford, hill, criteria, a, major, controversy, followed, when, koch, discovered, tuberculin, as, a, medication, for, tuberculosis, which, was, proven, to, be, ineffective, but, developed, for, diagnosis, of, tuberculosis, after, his, death, for, his, research, on, tuberculosis, he, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1905, the, day, he, announced, the, discovery, of, the, tuberculosis, bacterium, 24, march, 1882, has, been, observed, by, the, world, health, organization, as, world, tuberculosis, day, every, year, since, 1982, koch, was, born, in, clausthal, germany, on, 11, december, 1843, to, hermann, koch, 1814, 1877, and, mathilde, julie, henriette, n, e, biewend, 1818, 1871, his, father, was, a, mining, engineer, he, was, the, third, of, thirteen, siblings, he, excelled, academically, from, an, early, age, before, entering, school, in, 1848, he, had, taught, himself, how, to, read, and, write, he, completed, secondary, education, in, 1862, having, excelled, in, science, and, math, at, the, age, of, 19, in, 1862, koch, entered, the, university, of, g, ttingen, to, study, natural, science, he, took, up, mathematics, physics, and, botany, he, was, appointed, assistant, in, the, university, s, pathological, museum, after, three, semesters, he, decided, to, change, his, area, of, study, to, medicine, as, he, aspired, to, be, a, physician, during, his, fifth, semester, at, the, medical, school, jacob, henle, an, anatomist, who, had, published, a, theory, of, contagion, in, 1840, asked, him, to, participate, in, his, research, project, on, uterine, nerve, structure, this, research, won, him, a, research, prize, from, the, university, and, enabled, him, to, briefly, study, under, rudolf, virchow, who, was, at, the, time, considered, germany, s, most, renowned, physician, in, his, sixth, semester, koch, began, to, research, at, the, physiological, institute, where, he, studied, the, secretion, of, succinic, acid, which, is, a, signalling, molecule, that, is, also, involved, in, the, metabolism, of, the, mitochondria, this, would, eventually, form, the, basis, of, his, dissertation, in, january, 1866, he, graduated, from, the, medical, school, earning, honours, of, the, highest, distinction, maxima, cum, laude, robert, koch, is, widely, known, for, his, work, with, anthrax, discovering, the, causative, agent, of, the, fatal, disease, to, be, bacillus, anthracis, after, officially, becoming, a, district, physician, in, wollstein, today, s, wolsztyn, poland, in, 1872, robert, began, to, delve, into, the, disease, called, anthrax, near, wollstein, anthrax, disease, was, regularly, taking, the, lives, of, humans, and, livestock, without, evidence, explaining, why, eventually, in, 1876, koch, was, able, to, make, an, incredible, discovery, that, anthrax, was, triggered, by, one, singular, pathogen, koch, s, discovery, of, the, dormant, stage, the, anthrax, spores, allowed, him, to, successfully, unravel, the, mystery, behind, the, anthrax, disease, by, gaining, a, better, understanding, of, this, pathogen, he, was, able, to, shed, light, on, the, bacterium, s, remarkable, resistance, to, environmental, factors, robert, koch, nobel, lecture, 2018, this, groundbreaking, achievement, marked, koch, as, the, pioneer, scientist, to, discover, that, a, microscopic, organism, was, causing, a, disease, to, spread, his, findings, were, especially, impressive, as, they, were, done, in, a, poorly, equipped, laboratory, in, wollstein, he, published, the, discovery, in, a, booklet, as, die, tiologie, der, milzbrand, krankheit, begr, ndet, auf, die, entwicklungsgeschichte, des, bacillus, anthracis, the, etiology, of, anthrax, disease, based, on, the, developmental, history, of, bacillus, anthracis, in, 1876, while, working, at, in, w, llstein, his, publication, in, 1877, on, the, structure, of, anthrax, bacterium, marked, the, first, photography, of, a, bacterium, he, discovered, the, formation, of, spores, in, anthrax, bacteria, which, could, remain, dormant, under, specific, conditions, however, under, optimal, conditions, the, spores, were, activated, and, caused, disease, to, determine, this, causative, agent, he, dry, fixed, bacterial, cultures, onto, glass, slides, used, dyes, to, stain, the, cultures, and, observed, them, through, a, microscope, his, work, with, anthrax, is, notable, in, that, he, was, the, first, to, link, a, specific, microorganism, with, a, specific, disease, rejecting, the, idea, of, spontaneous, generation, and, supporting, the, germ, theory, of, disease, after, graduation, in, 1866, koch, briefly, worked, as, an, assistant, in, the, general, hospital, of, hamburg, in, october, of, that, year, he, moved, to, idiot, s, hospital, of, langenhagen, near, hanover, as, a, general, physician, in, 1868, he, moved, to, neimegk, and, then, to, rakwitz, in, 1869, as, the, franco, prussian, war, started, in, 1870, he, enlisted, in, the, german, army, as, a, volunteer, surgeon, in, 1871, to, support, the, war, effort, he, was, discharged, a, year, later, and, was, appointed, as, a, district, physician, kreisphysikus, in, wollstein, in, prussian, posen, now, wolsztyn, poland, as, his, family, settled, there, his, wife, gave, him, a, microscope, as, a, birthday, gift, with, the, microscope, he, set, up, a, private, laboratory, and, started, his, career, in, microbiology, koch, began, conducting, research, on, microorganisms, in, a, laboratory, connected, to, his, patient, s, examination, room, his, early, research, in, this, laboratory, yielded, one, of, his, major, contributions, to, the, field, of, microbiology, as, he, developed, the, technique, of, growing, bacteria, furthermore, he, managed, to, isolate, and, grow, selected, pathogens, in, a, pure, laboratory, culture, his, discovery, of, the, anthrax, bacillus, later, named, bacillus, anthracis, hugely, impressed, ferdinand, julius, cohn, professor, at, the, university, of, breslau, now, the, university, of, wroc, aw, who, helped, him, publish, the, discovery, in, 1876, cohn, had, established, the, institute, of, plant, physiology, and, invited, koch, to, demonstrate, his, new, bacterium, there, in, 1877, koch, was, transferred, to, breslau, as, district, physician, in, 1879, a, year, after, he, left, for, berlin, when, he, was, appointed, a, government, advisor, at, the, imperial, health, office, where, he, worked, from, 1880, to, 1885, following, his, discovery, of, the, tuberculosis, bacterium, he, was, promoted, to, geheimer, regierungsrat, a, senior, executive, position, in, june, 1882, in, 1885, koch, received, two, appointments, as, an, administrator, and, professor, at, berlin, university, he, became, director, of, hygienic, institute, and, chair, professor, of, hygiene, of, the, faculty, of, medicine, in, 1891, he, relinquished, his, professorship, and, became, a, director, of, the, royal, prussian, institute, for, infectious, diseases, now, the, robert, koch, institute, which, consisted, of, a, clinical, division, and, beds, for, the, division, of, clinical, research, for, this, he, accepted, harsh, conditions, the, prussian, ministry, of, health, insisted, after, the, 1890, scandal, with, tuberculin, which, koch, had, discovered, and, intended, as, a, remedy, for, tuberculosis, that, any, of, koch, s, inventions, would, unconditionally, belong, to, the, government, and, he, would, not, be, compensated, koch, lost, the, right, to, apply, for, patent, protection, in, 1906, he, moved, to, east, africa, to, research, a, cure, for, trypanosomiasis, sleeping, sickness, he, established, the, bugula, research, camp, where, up, to, 1000, people, a, day, were, treated, with, the, experimental, drug, atoxyl, robert, koch, made, two, important, developments, in, microscopy, he, was, the, first, to, use, an, oil, immersion, lens, and, a, condenser, that, enabled, smaller, objects, to, be, seen, in, addition, he, was, also, the, first, to, effectively, use, photography, microphotography, for, microscopic, observation, he, introduced, the, bedrock, methods, of, bacterial, staining, using, methylene, blue, and, bismarck, vesuvin, brown, dye, in, an, attempt, to, grow, bacteria, koch, began, to, use, solid, nutrients, such, as, potato, slices, through, these, initial, experiments, koch, observed, individual, colonies, of, identical, pure, cells, he, found, that, potato, slices, were, not, suitable, media, for, all, organisms, and, later, began, to, use, nutrient, solutions, with, gelatin, however, he, soon, realized, that, gelatin, like, potato, slices, was, not, the, optimal, medium, for, bacterial, growth, as, it, did, not, remain, solid, at, 37, c, the, ideal, temperature, for, growth, of, most, human, pathogens, and, also, many, bacteria, can, hydrolyze, gelatin, making, it, a, liquid, as, suggested, to, him, by, his, post, doctoral, assistant, walther, hesse, who, got, the, idea, from, his, wife, fanny, hesse, in, 1881, koch, started, using, agar, to, grow, and, isolate, pure, cultures, agar, is, a, polysaccharide, that, remains, solid, at, 37, c, is, not, degraded, by, most, bacteria, and, results, in, a, stable, transparent, medium, koch, s, booklet, published, in, 1881, titled, zur, untersuchung, von, pathogenen, organismen, methods, for, the, study, of, pathogenic, organisms, has, been, known, as, the, bible, of, bacteriology, in, it, he, described, a, novel, method, of, using, glass, slide, with, agar, to, grow, bacteria, the, method, involved, pouring, a, liquid, agar, onto, the, glass, slide, and, then, spreading, a, thin, layer, of, gelatin, over, it, the, gelatin, made, the, culture, medium, solidify, in, which, bacterial, samples, could, be, spread, uniformly, the, whole, bacterial, culture, was, then, put, on, a, glass, plate, together, with, a, small, wet, paper, koch, named, this, container, as, feuchte, kammer, moist, chamber, the, typical, chamber, was, a, circular, glass, dish, 20, cm, in, diameter, and, 5, cm, in, height, and, had, a, lid, to, prevent, contamination, the, glass, plate, and, the, transparent, culture, media, made, observation, of, the, bacterial, growth, easy, koch, publicly, demonstrated, his, plating, method, at, the, seventh, international, medical, congress, in, london, in, august, 1881, there, louis, pasteur, exclaimed, c, est, un, grand, progr, s, monsieur, what, a, great, progress, sir, it, was, using, koch, s, microscopy, and, agar, plate, culture, method, that, his, students, discovered, new, bacteria, friedrich, loeffler, discovered, the, bacteria, of, glanders, burkholderia, mallei, in, 1882, and, diphtheria, corynebacterium, diphtheriae, in, 1884, and, georg, theodor, august, gaffky, the, bacterium, of, typhoid, salmonella, enterica, in, 1884, koch, s, assistant, julius, richard, petri, developed, an, improved, method, and, published, it, in, 1887, as, eine, kleine, modification, des, koch, schen, plattenverfahrens, a, minor, modification, of, the, plating, technique, of, koch, the, culture, plate, was, given, an, eponymous, name, petri, dish, it, is, often, asserted, that, petri, developed, a, new, culture, plate, but, this, was, not, so, he, simply, discarded, the, use, of, glass, plate, and, instead, used, the, circular, glass, dish, directly, not, just, as, a, moist, chamber, but, as, the, main, culture, container, this, further, reduced, the, chances, of, contaminations, it, would, also, have, been, appropriate, if, the, name, koch, dish, had, been, given, during, his, time, as, the, government, advisor, with, the, imperial, health, agency, in, berlin, in, the, 1880s, koch, became, interested, in, tuberculosis, research, at, the, time, it, was, widely, believed, that, tuberculosis, was, an, inherited, disease, however, koch, was, convinced, that, the, disease, was, caused, by, a, bacterium, and, was, infectious, in, 1882, he, published, his, findings, on, tuberculosis, in, which, he, reported, the, causative, agent, of, the, disease, to, be, the, slow, growing, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, he, published, the, discovery, as, die, tiologie, der, tuberkulose, the, etiology, of, tuberculosis, and, presented, before, the, german, physiological, society, at, berlin, on, 24, march, 1882, koch, said, when, the, cover, glasses, were, exposed, to, this, staining, fluid, for, 24, hours, very, fine, rod, like, forms, became, apparent, in, the, tubercular, mass, for, the, first, time, having, as, further, observations, showed, the, power, of, multiplication, and, of, spore, formation, and, hence, belonging, to, the, same, group, of, organisms, as, the, anthrax, bacillus, microscopic, examination, then, showed, that, only, the, previously, blue, stained, cell, nuclei, and, detritus, became, brown, while, the, tubercle, bacilli, remained, a, beautiful, blue, there, was, no, particular, reaction, to, this, announcement, eminent, scientists, such, as, rudolf, virchow, remained, sceptical, virchow, clung, to, his, theory, that, all, diseases, are, due, to, faulty, cellular, activities, on, the, other, hand, paul, ehrlich, later, recollected, that, this, moment, was, his, single, greatest, scientific, experience, koch, expanded, the, report, and, published, it, under, the, same, title, as, a, booklet, in, 1884, in, which, he, concluded, that, the, discovery, of, tuberculosis, bacterium, fulfilled, the, three, principles, eventually, known, as, koch, s, postulates, which, were, formulated, by, his, assistant, friedrich, loeffler, in, 1883, saying, all, these, factors, together, allow, me, to, conclude, that, the, bacilli, present, in, the, tuberculous, lesions, do, not, only, accompany, tuberculosis, but, rather, cause, it, these, bacilli, are, the, true, agents, of, tuberculosis, in, august, 1883, the, german, government, sent, a, medical, team, led, by, koch, to, alexandria, egypt, to, investigate, a, cholera, epidemic, there, koch, soon, found, that, the, intestinal, mucosa, of, people, who, died, of, cholera, always, had, bacterial, infection, yet, could, not, confirm, whether, the, bacteria, were, the, causative, pathogens, as, the, outbreak, in, egypt, declined, he, was, transferred, to, calcutta, now, kolkata, india, where, there, was, a, more, severe, outbreak, he, soon, found, that, the, river, ganges, was, the, source, of, cholera, he, performed, autopsies, of, almost, 100, bodies, and, found, in, each, bacterial, infection, he, identified, the, same, bacteria, from, water, tanks, linking, the, source, of, the, infection, he, isolated, the, bacterium, in, pure, culture, on, 7, january, 1884, he, subsequently, confirmed, that, the, bacterium, was, a, new, species, and, described, as, a, little, bent, like, a, comma, his, experiment, using, fresh, blood, samples, indicated, that, the, bacterium, could, kill, red, blood, cells, and, he, hypothesized, that, some, sort, of, poison, was, used, by, the, bacterium, to, cause, the, disease, in, 1959, indian, scientist, sambhu, nath, de, discovered, this, poison, the, cholera, toxin, koch, reported, his, discovery, to, the, german, secretary, of, state, for, the, interior, on, 2, february, and, published, it, in, the, deutsche, medizinische, wochenschrift, german, medical, weekly, the, following, month, although, koch, was, convinced, that, the, bacterium, was, the, cholera, pathogen, he, could, not, entirely, establish, critical, evidence, the, bacterium, produced, the, symptoms, in, healthy, subjects, following, koch, s, postulates, his, experiment, on, animals, using, his, pure, bacteria, culture, did, not, cause, the, disease, and, correctly, explained, that, animals, are, immune, to, human, pathogen, the, bacterium, was, then, known, as, the, comma, bacillus, and, scientifically, as, bacillus, comma, it, was, later, realised, that, the, bacterium, was, already, described, by, an, italian, physician, filippo, pacini, in, 1854, and, was, also, observed, by, the, catalan, physician, joaquim, balcells, i, pascual, around, the, same, time, but, they, failed, to, identify, the, bacterium, as, the, causative, agent, of, cholera, koch, s, colleague, richard, friedrich, johannes, pfeiffer, correctly, identified, the, comma, bacillus, as, pacini, s, vibrioni, and, renamed, it, as, vibrio, cholera, in, 1896, koch, gave, much, of, his, research, attention, to, tuberculosis, throughout, his, career, after, medical, expeditions, to, various, parts, of, the, world, he, again, focussed, on, tuberculosis, from, the, mid, 1880s, by, that, time, the, imperial, health, office, was, carrying, out, a, project, for, disinfection, of, sputum, of, tuberculosis, patients, koch, experimented, with, arsenic, and, creosote, as, possible, disinfectants, these, chemicals, and, other, available, drugs, did, not, work, his, report, in, 1883, also, mentioned, a, failed, experiment, in, an, attempt, to, make, a, tuberculosis, vaccine, by, 1888, koch, turned, his, attention, to, synthetic, dyes, as, antibacterial, chemicals, he, developed, a, method, for, examining, antibacterial, activity, by, mixing, the, gelatin, based, culture, media, with, a, yellow, dye, auramin, his, notebook, indicates, that, by, february, 1890, he, tested, hundreds, of, compounds, in, one, of, such, tests, he, found, that, an, extract, from, the, tuberculosis, bacterium, culture, dissolved, in, glycerine, could, cure, tuberculosis, in, guinea, pigs, based, on, a, series, of, experiments, from, april, to, july, 1891, he, could, conclude, that, the, extract, did, not, kill, the, tuberculosis, bacterium, but, destroyed, by, necrosis, the, infected, tissues, thereby, depriving, bacterial, growth, he, made, a, vague, announcement, in, august, 1890, at, the, tenth, international, medical, congress, in, berlin, saying, in, a, communication, which, i, made, a, few, months, ago, to, the, international, medical, congress, i, described, a, substance, of, which, the, result, is, to, make, laboratory, animals, insensitive, to, inoculation, of, tubercle, bacilli, and, in, the, case, of, already, infected, animals, to, bring, the, tuberculous, process, to, a, halt, i, can, tell, that, much, that, guinea, pigs, which, are, highly, susceptible, to, the, disease, no, longer, react, upon, inoculation, with, tubercle, virus, when, treated, with, that, substance, and, that, in, guinea, pigs, which, are, sick, with, tuberculosis, the, pathological, process, can, be, brought, to, a, complete, standstill, by, november, 1890, koch, demonstrated, the, effectiveness, of, the, extract, in, treating, humans, by, administering, the, vaccine, through, the, bacillus, calmette, guerin, bcg, technique, this, absorbs, the, vaccine, through, the, skin, by, means, of, multiple, shallow, punctures, on, the, skin, and, many, patients, and, doctors, went, to, berlin, to, get, koch, s, remedy, while, this, was, effective, in, humans, his, experiments, also, revealed, that, when, the, substance, was, inoculated, into, his, tuberculosis, infected, test, guinea, pigs, they, presented, with, severe, symptoms, this, outcome, characterized, by, an, exaggerated, immune, response, coined, the, term, koch, s, phenomenon, this, is, known, as, an, extreme, skin, reaction, that, manifests, itself, at, the, bcg, vaccination, site, within, a, few, days, after, the, vaccine, is, administered, to, an, individual, infected, with, tuberculosis, when, a, normal, guinea, pig, was, inoculated, with, pure, tubercle, bacillus, the, wound, would, close, rapidly, and, heal, within, several, days, afterwards, the, site, of, the, injection, would, open, and, form, an, ulcer, until, the, animal, died, however, if, the, same, inoculated, culture, was, injected, into, a, guinea, pig, that, was, previously, infected, with, tuberculosis, the, site, of, the, injection, becomes, dark, and, eventually, heals, normally, and, quickly, moreland, 2024, the, uncertainty, in, the, chemical, nature, coined, the, term, phenomenon, in, the, name, koch, s, phenomenon, koch, published, his, experiments, in, the, 15, january, 1891, issue, of, deutsche, medizinische, wochenschrift, and, the, british, medical, journal, immediately, published, the, english, version, simultaneously, the, english, version, was, also, reproduced, in, nature, and, the, lancet, in, the, same, month, the, lancet, presented, it, as, glad, tidings, of, great, joy, koch, simply, referred, to, the, medication, as, brownish, transparent, fluid, josephs, pohl, pincus, had, used, the, name, tuberculin, in, 1844, for, tuberculosis, culture, media, and, koch, subsequently, adopted, as, tuberkulin, the, first, report, on, the, clinical, trial, in, 1891, was, disappointing, by, then, 1061, patients, with, tuberculosis, of, internal, organs, and, of, 708, patients, with, tuberculosis, of, external, tissues, were, given, the, treatment, an, attempt, to, use, tuberculin, as, a, therapeutic, drug, is, regarded, as, koch, s, greatest, failure, with, it, his, reputation, greatly, waned, but, he, devoted, the, rest, of, his, life, trying, to, make, tuberculin, as, a, usable, medication, his, discovery, was, not, a, total, failure, the, substance, is, now, used, to, test, for, hypersensitivity, in, tuberculosis, patients, koch, observed, the, phenomenon, of, acquired, immunity, on, 26, december, 1900, he, arrived, as, part, of, an, expedition, to, german, new, guinea, which, was, then, a, protectorate, of, the, german, reich, koch, serially, examined, the, papuan, people, the, indigenous, inhabitants, and, their, blood, samples, and, noticed, they, contained, plasmodium, parasites, the, cause, of, malaria, but, their, bouts, of, malaria, were, mild, or, could, not, even, be, noticed, i, e, were, subclinical, on, the, contrary, german, settlers, and, chinese, workers, who, had, been, brought, to, new, guinea, fell, sick, immediately, the, longer, they, had, stayed, in, the, country, however, the, more, they, too, seemed, to, develop, a, resistance, against, it, during, his, time, as, government, advisor, koch, published, a, report, on, how, he, discovered, and, experimentally, showed, tuberculosis, bacterium, as, the, pathogen, of, tuberculosis, he, described, the, importance, of, pure, cultures, in, isolating, disease, causing, organisms, and, explained, the, necessary, steps, to, obtain, these, cultures, methods, which, are, summarized, in, koch, s, four, postulates, koch, s, discovery, of, the, causative, agent, of, anthrax, led, to, the, formation, of, a, generic, set, of, postulates, which, can, be, used, in, the, determination, of, the, cause, of, most, infectious, diseases, these, postulates, which, not, only, outlined, a, method, for, linking, cause, and, effect, of, an, infectious, disease, but, also, established, the, significance, of, laboratory, culture, of, infectious, agents, became, the, gold, standard, in, infectious, diseases, although, koch, worked, out, the, principles, he, did, not, formulate, the, postulates, which, were, introduced, by, his, assistant, friedrich, loeffler, loeffler, reporting, his, discovery, of, diphtheria, bacillus, in, 1883, stated, three, postulates, as, follows, the, fourth, postulate, was, added, by, an, american, plant, pathologist, erwin, frink, smith, in, 1905, and, is, stated, as, in, july, 1867, koch, married, emma, emmy, adolfine, josephine, fraatz, and, the, two, had, a,

prize, in, physiology, and, medicine, for, his, investigations, and, discoveries, in, relation, to, tuberculosis, in, 1906, research, on, tuberculosis, and, tropical, diseases, won, him, the, order, pour, le, merite, and, in, 1908, the, robert, koch, medal, established, to, honour, the, greatest, living, physicians, emperor, wilhelm, i, awarded, him, the, order, of, the, crown, 100, 000, marks, and, appointment, as, privy, imperial, councillor, surgeon, general, of, health, service, and, fellow, of, the, science, senate, of, kaiser, wilhelm, society, koch, established, the, royal, prussian, institute, for, infectious, diseases, in, berlin, in, 1891, after, his, death, it, was, renamed, robert, koch, institute, in, his, honour, the, world, health, organization, has, observed, world, tuberculosis, day, every, 24, march, since, 1982, to, commemorate, the, day, koch, discovered, the, tuberculosis, bacterium, koch, s, name, is, one, of, 23, from, the, fields, of, hygiene, and, tropical, medicine, featured, on, the, frieze, of, the, london, school, of, hygiene, tropical, medicine, building, in, keppel, street, bloomsbury, a, large, marble, statue, of, koch, stands, in, a, small, park, known, as, robert, koch, platz, just, north, of, the, charity, hospital, in, the, mitte, section, of, berlin, his, life, was, the, subject, of, a, 1939, german, produced, motion, picture, that, featured, oscar, winning, actor, emil, jannings, in, the, title, role, on, 10, december, 2017, google, showed, a, doodle, in, celebration, of, koch, s, birthday, koch, and, his, relationship, to, paul, ehrlich, who, developed, a, mechanism, to, diagnose, tb, were, portrayed, in, the, 1940, movie, dr, ehrlich, s, magic, bullet, at, their, first, meeting, at, the, seventh, international, medical, congress, in, london, in, august, 1881, koch, and, pasteur, were, friendly, towards, each, other, but, the, rest, of, their, careers, followed, with, scientific, disputes, the, conflict, started, when, koch, interpreted, his, discovery, of, anthrax, bacillus, in, 1876, as, causality, that, is, the, germ, caused, the, anthrax, infections, although, his, postulates, were, not, yet, formulated, he, did, not, establish, the, bacterium, as, the, cause, of, the, disease, it, was, an, inference, pasteur, therefore, argued, that, koch, s, discovery, was, not, the, full, proof, of, causality, but, pasteur, s, anthrax, vaccine, developed, in, 1881, was, koch, published, his, conclusion, in, 1881, with, a, statement, anthrax, never, occurs, without, viable, anthrax, bacilli, or, spores, in, my, opinion, no, more, conclusive, proof, can, be, given, that, anthrax, bacilli, are, the, true, and, only, cause, of, anthrax, and, that, vaccination, such, as, claimed, by, pasteur, would, be, impossible, to, prove, his, vaccine, pasteur, sent, his, assistant, louis, thuillier, to, germany, for, demonstration, and, disproved, koch, s, idea, they, had, a, heated, public, debate, at, the, international, congress, for, hygiene, in, geneva, in, 1882, where, koch, criticised, pasteur, s, methods, as, unreliable, and, claimed, they, are, false, and, they, inevitably, lead, to, false, conclusions, koch, later, continued, to, attack, pasteur, saying, pasteur, is, not, a, physician, and, one, cannot, expect, him, to, make, sound, judgments, about, pathological, processes, and, the, symptoms, of, disease, when, koch, discovered, tuberculin, in, 1890, as, a, medication, for, tuberculosis, he, kept, the, experiment, secret, and, avoided, disclosing, the, source, it, was, only, after, a, year, under, public, pressure, that, he, publicly, announced, the, experiment, and, the, source, clinical, trials, with, tuberculin, were, disastrous, and, complete, failures, rudolf, virchow, s, autopsy, report, of, 21, subjects, treated, with, tuberculin, to, the, berlin, medical, society, on, 7, january, 1891, revealed, that, instead, of, healing, tuberculosis, the, subjects, died, because, of, the, treatment, one, week, later, koch, publicised, that, the, drug, was, a, glycerine, extract, of, a, pure, cultivation, of, the, tuberculosis, bacilli, the, german, official, report, in, late, 1891, declared, that, tuberculosis, was, not, cured, with, tuberculin, from, this, moment, onwards, koch, s, prestige, fell, apart, the, reason, for, his, initial, secrecy, was, due, to, an, ambition, for, monetary, benefits, for, the, new, drug, and, with, that, establishment, of, his, own, research, institute, since, 1885, he, had, tried, to, leave, government, service, and, create, an, independent, state, run, institute, of, his, own, following, the, disappointment, he, was, released, from, the, university, of, berlin, and, forced, to, work, as, director, of, the, royal, prussian, institute, for, infectious, diseases, a, newly, established, institute, in, 1891, he, was, prohibited, from, working, on, tuberculin, and, from, claiming, patent, rights, in, any, of, his, subsequent, works, koch, initially, believed, that, human, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, and, cattle, tuberculosis, bacilli, now, called, mycobacterium, bovis, were, different, pathogens, when, he, made, the, discovery, in, 1882, two, years, later, he, revoked, that, position, and, asserted, that, the, two, bacilli, were, the, same, type, this, later, assumption, was, taken, as, a, fact, in, veterinary, practice, based, on, it, legislations, were, made, in, the, us, for, the, inspection, of, meat, and, milk, in, 1898, an, american, veterinarian, theobald, smith, published, a, detailed, comparative, study, and, found, that, the, tuberculosis, bacteria, are, different, based, on, their, structure, growth, patterns, and, pathogenicity, in, addition, he, also, discovered, that, there, were, variations, in, each, type, in, his, conclusion, he, made, two, important, points, by, that, time, there, was, evidence, that, cattle, tuberculosis, was, transmitted, to, humans, through, meat, and, milk, upon, these, reports, koch, conceded, that, the, two, bacilli, were, different, but, still, advocated, that, cattle, tuberculosis, was, of, no, health, concern, speaking, at, the, third, international, congress, on, tuberculosis, held, in, london, in, july, 1901, he, said, that, cattle, tuberculosis, is, not, dangerous, to, humans, and, there, is, no, need, for, medical, attention, he, said, i, therefore, consider, it, unnecessary, to, take, any, measures, against, this, form, of, tb, the, fight, against, tb, clearly, has, to, concentrate, on, the, human, bacillus, chair, of, the, congress, joseph, lister, reprimanded, koch, and, explained, the, medical, evidence, of, cattle, tuberculosis, in, humans, the, nobel, committee, selected, the, 1902, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, to, be, awarded, for, the, discovery, of, the, transmission, of, malaria, but, it, could, not, make, the, final, decision, on, whom, to, give, it, to, the, british, surgeon, ronald, ross, or, the, italian, biologist, giovanni, battista, grassi, ross, had, discovered, that, the, human, malarial, parasite, was, carried, by, certain, mosquitoes, in, 1897, and, the, next, year, that, bird, malaria, could, be, transmitted, from, infected, to, healthy, birds, by, the, bite, of, a, mosquito, grassi, had, discovered, plasmodium, vivax, and, the, bird, malaria, parasite, and, towards, the, end, of, 1898, the, transmission, of, plasmodium, falciparum, between, humans, through, mosquitoes, anopheles, claviger, to, the, surprise, of, the, nobel, committee, the, two, nominees, exchanged, polemic, arguments, against, each, other, publicly, justifying, the, importance, of, their, own, works, robert, koch, was, then, appointed, as, a, neutral, arbitrator, to, make, the, final, decision, to, his, disadvantage, grassi, had, criticised, koch, on, his, malaria, research, in, 1898, during, an, investigation, of, the, epidemic, while, ross, had, established, a, cordial, relationship, with, koch, ross, was, selected, for, the, award, as, koch, threw, the, full, weight, of, his, considerable, authority, in, insisting, that, grassi, did, not, deserve, the, honour
