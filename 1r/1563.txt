versions, of, truth, s, words, have, been, recorded, with, the, first, one, published, a, month, later, in, the, anti, slavery, bugle, by, rev, marius, robinson, the, newspaper, owner, and, editor, who, was, in, the, audience, robinson, s, recounting, of, the, speech, included, no, instance, of, the, question, ain, t, i, a, woman, nor, did, any, of, the, other, newspapers, reporting, of, her, speech, at, the, time, twelve, years, later, in, may, 1863, gage, published, another, very, different, version, in, it, truth, s, speech, pattern, appeared, to, have, characteristics, of, black, slaves, located, in, the, southern, united, states, and, the, speech, was, vastly, different, from, the, one, robinson, had, reported, gage, s, version, of, the, speech, became, the, most, widely, circulated, version, and, is, known, as, ain, t, i, a, woman, because, that, question, was, repeated, four, times, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, truth, s, own, speech, pattern, was, like, this, as, she, was, born, and, raised, in, new, york, and, she, spoke, only, upper, new, york, state, low, dutch, until, she, was, nine, years, old, in, the, version, recorded, by, rev, marius, robinson, truth, said, i, want, to, say, a, few, words, about, this, matter, i, am, a, woman, s, rights, i, have, as, much, muscle, as, any, man, and, can, do, as, much, work, as, any, man, i, have, plowed, and, reaped, and, husked, and, chopped, and, mowed, and, can, any, man, do, more, than, that, i, have, heard, much, about, the, sexes, being, equal, i, can, carry, as, much, as, any, man, and, can, eat, as, much, too, if, i, can, get, it, i, am, as, strong, as, any, man, that, is, now, as, for, intellect, all, i, can, say, is, if, a, woman, have, a, pint, and, a, man, a, quart, why, can, t, she, have, her, little, pint, full, you, need, not, be, afraid, to, give, us, our, rights, for, fear, we, will, take, too, much, for, we, can, t, take, more, than, our, pint, ll, hold, the, poor, men, seems, to, be, all, in, confusion, and, don, t, know, what, to, do, why, children, if, you, have, woman, s, rights, give, it, to, her, and, you, will, feel, better, you, will, have, your, own, rights, and, they, won, t, be, so, much, trouble, i, can, t, read, but, i, can, hear, i, have, heard, the, bible, and, have, learned, that, eve, caused, man, to, sin, well, if, woman, upset, the, world, do, give, her, a, chance, to, set, it, right, side, up, again, the, lady, has, spoken, about, jesus, how, he, never, spurned, woman, from, him, and, she, was, right, when, lazarus, died, mary, and, martha, came, to, him, with, faith, and, love, and, besought, him, to, raise, their, brother, and, jesus, wept, and, lazarus, came, forth, and, how, came, jesus, into, the, world, through, god, who, created, him, and, the, woman, who, bore, him, man, where, was, your, part, but, the, women, are, coming, up, blessed, be, god, and, a, few, of, the, men, are, coming, up, with, them, but, man, is, in, a, tight, place, the, poor, slave, is, on, him, woman, is, coming, on, him, he, is, surely, between, a, hawk, and, a, buzzard, in, contrast, to, robinson, s, report, gage, s, 1863, version, included, truth, saying, her, 13, children, were, sold, away, from, her, into, slavery, truth, is, widely, believed, to, have, had, five, children, with, one, sold, away, and, was, never, known, to, boast, more, children, gage, s, 1863, recollection, of, the, convention, conflicts, with, her, own, report, directly, after, the, convention, gage, wrote, in, 1851, that, akron, in, general, and, the, press, in, particular, were, largely, friendly, to, the, woman, s, rights, convention, but, in, 1863, she, wrote, that, the, convention, leaders, were, fearful, of, the, mobbish, opponents, other, eyewitness, reports, of, truth, s, speech, told, a, calm, story, one, where, all, faces, were, beaming, with, joyous, gladness, at, the, session, where, truth, spoke, that, not, one, discordant, note, interrupted, the, harmony, of, the, proceedings, in, contemporary, reports, truth, was, warmly, received, by, the, convention, goers, the, majority, of, whom, were, long, standing, abolitionists, friendly, to, progressive, ideas, of, race, and, civil, rights, in, gage, s, 1863, version, truth, was, met, with, hisses, with, voices, calling, to, prevent, her, from, speaking, other, interracial, gatherings, of, black, and, white, abolitionist, women, had, in, fact, been, met, with, violence, including, the, burning, of, pennsylvania, hall, according, to, frances, gage, s, recount, in, 1863, truth, argued, that, man, over, there, says, that, women, need, to, be, helped, into, carriages, and, lifted, over, ditches, and, to, have, the, best, place, everywhere, nobody, helps, me, any, best, place, and, ain, t, i, a, woman, truth, s, ain, t, i, a, woman, showed, the, lack, of, recognition, that, black, women, received, during, this, time, and, whose, lack, of, recognition, will, continue, to, be, seen, long, after, her, time, black, women, of, course, were, virtually, invisible, within, the, protracted, campaign, for, woman, suffrage, wrote, angela, davis, supporting, truth, s, argument, that, nobody, gives, her, any, best, place, and, not, just, her, but, black, women, in, general, over, the, next, 10, years, truth, spoke, before, dozens, perhaps, hundreds, of, audiences, from, 1851, to, 1853, truth, worked, with, marius, robinson, the, editor, of, the, ohio, anti, slavery, bugle, and, traveled, around, that, state, speaking, in, 1853, she, spoke, at, a, suffragist, mob, convention, at, the, broadway, tabernacle, in, new, york, city, that, year, she, also, met, harriet, beecher, stowe, in, 1856, she, traveled, to, battle, creek, michigan, to, speak, to, a, group, called, the, friends, of, human, progress, northampton, camp, meeting, 1844, northampton, massachusetts, at, a, camp, meeting, where, she, was, participating, as, an, itinerant, preacher, a, band, of, wild, young, men, disrupted, the, camp, meeting, refused, to, leave, and, threatened, to, burn, down, the, tents, truth, caught, the, sense, of, fear, pervading, the, worshipers, and, hid, behind, a, trunk, in, her, tent, thinking, that, since, she, was, the, only, black, person, present, the, mob, would, attack, her, first, however, she, reasoned, with, herself, and, resolved, to, do, something, as, the, noise, of, the, mob, increased, and, a, female, preacher, was, trembling, on, the, preachers, stand, truth, went, to, a, small, hill, and, began, to, sing, in, her, most, fervid, manner, with, all, the, strength, of, her, most, powerful, voice, the, hymn, on, the, resurrection, of, christ, her, song, it, was, early, in, the, morning, gathered, the, rioters, to, her, and, quieted, them, they, urged, her, to, sing, preach, and, pray, for, their, entertainment, after, singing, songs, and, preaching, for, about, an, hour, truth, bargained, with, them, to, leave, after, one, final, song, the, mob, agreed, and, left, the, camp, meeting, abolitionist, convention, 1840s, boston, massachusetts, william, lloyd, garrison, invited, sojourner, truth, to, give, a, speech, at, an, annual, antislavery, convention, wendell, phillips, was, supposed, to, speak, after, her, which, made, her, nervous, since, he, was, known, as, such, a, good, orator, so, truth, sang, a, song, i, am, pleading, for, my, people, which, was, her, own, original, composition, sung, to, the, tune, of, auld, lang, syne, mob, convention, september, 7, 1853, at, the, convention, young, men, greeted, her, with, a, perfect, storm, hissing, and, groaning, in, response, truth, said, you, may, hiss, as, much, as, you, please, but, women, will, get, their, rights, anyway, you, can, t, stop, us, neither, sojourner, like, other, public, speakers, often, adapted, her, speeches, to, how, the, audience, was, responding, to, her, in, her, speech, sojourner, speaks, out, for, women, s, rights, she, incorporates, religious, references, in, her, speech, particularly, the, story, of, esther, she, then, goes, on, to, say, that, just, as, women, in, scripture, women, today, are, fighting, for, their, rights, moreover, sojourner, scolds, the, crowd, for, all, their, hissing, and, rude, behavior, reminding, them, that, god, says, to, honor, thy, father, and, thy, mother, american, equal, rights, association, may, 9, 10, 1867, her, speech, was, addressed, to, the, american, equal, rights, association, and, divided, into, three, sessions, sojourner, was, received, with, loud, cheers, instead, of, hisses, now, that, she, had, a, better, formed, reputation, established, the, call, had, advertised, her, name, as, one, of, the, main, convention, speakers, for, the, first, part, of, her, speech, she, spoke, mainly, about, the, rights, of, black, women, sojourner, argued, that, because, the, push, for, equal, rights, had, led, to, black, men, winning, new, rights, now, was, the, best, time, to, give, black, women, the, rights, they, deserve, too, throughout, her, speech, she, kept, stressing, that, we, should, keep, things, going, while, things, are, stirring, and, fears, that, once, the, fight, for, colored, rights, settles, down, it, would, take, a, long, time, to, warm, people, back, up, to, the, idea, of, colored, women, s, having, equal, rights, in, the, second, sessions, of, sojourner, s, speech, she, used, a, story, from, the, bible, to, help, strengthen, her, argument, for, equal, rights, for, women, she, ended, her, argument, by, accusing, men, of, being, self, centered, saying, man, is, so, selfish, that, he, has, got, women, s, rights, and, his, own, too, and, yet, he, won, t, give, women, their, rights, he, keeps, them, all, to, himself, for, the, final, session, of, sojourner, s, speech, the, center, of, her, attention, was, mainly, on, women, s, right, to, vote, sojourner, told, her, audience, that, she, owned, her, own, house, as, did, other, women, and, must, therefore, pay, taxes, nevertheless, they, were, still, unable, to, vote, because, they, were, women, black, women, who, were, enslaved, were, made, to, do, hard, manual, work, such, as, building, roads, sojourner, argues, that, if, these, women, were, able, to, perform, such, tasks, then, they, should, be, allowed, to, vote, because, surely, voting, is, easier, than, building, roads, eighth, anniversary, of, negro, freedom, new, year, s, day, 1871, on, this, occasion, the, boston, papers, related, that, seldom, is, there, an, occasion, of, more, attraction, or, greater, general, interest, every, available, space, of, sitting, and, standing, room, was, crowded, she, starts, off, her, speech, by, giving, a, little, background, about, her, own, life, sojourner, recounts, how, her, mother, told, her, to, pray, to, god, that, she, may, have, good, masters, and, mistresses, she, goes, on, to, retell, how, her, masters, were, not, good, to, her, about, how, she, was, whipped, for, not, understanding, english, and, how, she, would, question, god, why, he, had, not, made, her, masters, be, good, to, her, sojourner, admits, to, the, audience, that, she, had,
