and, religious, author, who, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, first, existentialist, philosopher, he, wrote, critical, texts, on, organized, religion, christianity, morality, ethics, psychology, and, the, philosophy, of, religion, displaying, a, fondness, for, metaphor, irony, and, parables, much, of, his, philosophical, work, deals, with, the, issues, of, how, one, lives, as, a, single, individual, giving, priority, to, concrete, human, reality, over, abstract, thinking, and, highlighting, the, importance, of, personal, choice, and, commitment, he, was, against, literary, critics, who, defined, idealist, intellectuals, and, philosophers, of, his, time, and, thought, that, swedenborg, hegel, fichte, schelling, schlegel, and, hans, christian, andersen, were, all, understood, far, too, quickly, by, scholars, kierkegaard, s, theological, work, focuses, on, christian, ethics, the, institution, of, the, church, the, differences, between, purely, objective, proofs, of, christianity, the, infinite, qualitative, distinction, between, man, and, god, and, the, individual, s, subjective, relationship, to, the, god, man, jesus, the, christ, which, came, through, faith, much, of, his, work, deals, with, christian, love, he, was, extremely, critical, of, the, doctrine, and, practice, of, christianity, as, a, state, controlled, religion, caesaropapism, like, the, church, of, denmark, his, psychological, work, explored, the, emotions, and, feelings, of, individuals, when, faced, with, life, choices, opposite, jean, paul, sartre, and, the, atheistic, existentialism, paradigm, kierkegaard, focused, on, christian, existentialism, kierkegaard, s, early, work, was, written, using, pseudonyms, to, present, distinctive, viewpoints, interacting, in, complex, dialogue, he, explored, particularly, complex, problems, from, different, viewpoints, each, under, a, different, pseudonym, he, wrote, upbuilding, discourses, under, his, own, name, and, dedicated, them, to, the, single, individual, who, might, want, to, discover, the, meaning, of, his, works, he, wrote, science, and, scholarship, want, to, teach, that, becoming, objective, is, the, way, christianity, teaches, that, the, way, is, to, become, subjective, to, become, a, subject, while, scientists, learn, about, the, world, by, observation, kierkegaard, emphatically, denied, that, observation, alone, could, reveal, the, inner, workings, of, the, world, of, the, spirit, some, of, kierkegaard, s, key, ideas, include, the, concept, of, subjective, and, objective, truths, the, knight, of, faith, the, recollection, and, repetition, dichotomy, angst, the, infinite, qualitative, distinction, faith, as, a, passion, and, the, three, stages, on, life, s, way, kierkegaard, wrote, in, danish, and, the, reception, of, his, work, was, initially, limited, to, scandinavia, but, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, his, writings, were, translated, into, french, german, and, other, major, european, languages, by, the, mid, 20th, century, his, thought, exerted, a, substantial, influence, on, philosophy, theology, and, western, culture, in, general, kierkegaard, was, born, to, an, affluent, family, in, copenhagen, his, mother, ane, s, rensdatter, lund, kierkegaard, 1768, 1834, had, served, as, a, maid, in, the, household, before, marrying, his, father, michael, pedersen, kierkegaard, 1756, 1838, she, was, an, unassuming, figure, quiet, and, not, formally, educated, they, had, seven, children, her, granddaughter, henriette, lund, wrote, that, she, wielded, the, sceptre, with, joy, and, protected, like, a, hen, protecting, her, chicks, she, also, wielded, influence, on, her, children, so, that, later, peter, said, that, his, brother, preserved, many, of, their, mother, s, words, in, his, writings, his, father, on, the, other, hand, was, a, well, to, do, wool, merchant, from, jutland, he, was, a, very, stern, man, to, all, appearances, dry, and, prosaic, but, under, his, rustic, cloak, demeanor, he, concealed, an, active, imagination, which, not, even, his, great, age, could, blunt, he, was, also, interested, in, philosophy, and, often, hosted, intellectuals, at, his, home, he, was, devoted, to, the, rationalist, philosophy, of, christian, wolff, and, he, eventually, retired, partly, to, pursue, more, of, wolff, s, writings, kierkegaard, who, followed, his, father, s, beliefs, as, a, child, was, heavily, influenced, by, michael, s, devotion, to, wolffian, rationalism, he, also, enjoyed, the, comedies, of, ludvig, holberg, the, writings, of, johann, georg, hamann, gotthold, ephraim, lessing, edward, young, and, plato, the, figure, of, socrates, whom, kierkegaard, encountered, in, plato, s, dialogues, would, prove, to, be, a, phenomenal, influence, on, the, philosopher, s, later, interest, in, irony, as, well, as, his, frequent, deployment, of, indirect, communication, kierkegaard, loved, to, walk, along, the, crooked, streets, of, 19th, century, copenhagen, where, carriages, rarely, went, in, 1848, kierkegaard, wrote, i, had, real, christian, satisfaction, in, the, thought, that, if, there, were, no, other, there, was, definitely, one, man, in, copenhagen, whom, every, poor, person, could, freely, accost, and, converse, with, on, the, street, that, if, there, were, no, other, there, was, one, man, who, whatever, the, society, he, most, commonly, frequented, did, not, shun, contact, with, the, poor, but, greeted, every, maidservant, he, was, acquainted, with, every, manservant, every, common, laborer, our, lady, s, church, was, at, one, end, of, the, city, where, bishop, mynster, preached, the, gospel, at, the, other, end, was, the, royal, theatre, where, fru, heiberg, performed, based, on, a, speculative, interpretation, of, anecdotes, in, kierkegaard, s, unpublished, journals, especially, a, rough, draft, of, a, story, called, the, great, earthquake, some, early, kierkegaard, scholars, argued, that, michael, believed, he, had, earned, god, s, wrath, and, that, none, of, his, children, would, outlive, him, he, is, said, to, have, believed, that, his, personal, sins, perhaps, indiscretions, such, as, cursing, the, name, of, god, in, his, youth, or, impregnating, ane, out, of, wedlock, necessitated, this, punishment, though, five, of, his, seven, children, died, before, he, did, both, s, ren, and, his, brother, peter, christian, kierkegaard, outlived, him, peter, who, was, seven, years, older, later, became, bishop, in, aalborg, julia, watkin, thought, michael, s, early, interest, in, the, moravian, church, could, have, led, him, to, a, deep, sense, of, the, devastating, effects, of, sin, s, ren, kierkegaard, came, to, hope, that, no, one, would, retain, their, sins, once, they, had, been, forgiven, and, by, the, same, token, that, no, one, who, truly, believed, in, the, forgiveness, of, sin, would, live, their, own, life, as, an, objection, against, the, existence, of, forgiveness, he, made, the, point, that, cato, committed, suicide, before, caesar, had, a, chance, to, forgive, him, this, fear, of, not, finding, forgiveness, is, devastating, edna, h, hong, quoted, kierkegaard, in, her, 1984, book, forgiveness, is, a, work, as, well, as, a, grace, and, kierkegaard, wrote, about, forgiveness, in, 1847, in, 1954, samuel, barber, set, to, music, kierkegaard, s, prayer, father, in, heaven, hold, not, our, sins, up, against, us, but, hold, us, up, against, our, sins, so, that, the, thought, of, you, when, it, wakens, in, our, soul, and, each, time, it, wakens, should, not, remind, us, of, what, we, have, committed, but, of, what, you, did, forgive, not, of, how, we, went, astray, but, of, how, you, did, save, us, from, 1821, to, 1830, kierkegaard, attended, the, school, of, civic, virtue, stre, borgerdyd, gymnasium, when, the, school, was, situated, in, klarebodeme, where, kierkegaard, studied, and, learned, latin, greek, and, history, among, other, subjects, during, his, time, there, he, was, described, as, very, conservative, someone, who, would, honour, the, king, love, the, church, and, respect, the, police, he, frequently, got, into, altercations, with, fellow, students, and, was, ambivalent, towards, his, teachers, he, went, on, to, study, theology, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, he, had, little, interest, in, historical, works, philosophy, dissatisfied, him, and, he, couldn, t, see, dedicating, himself, to, speculation, he, said, what, i, really, need, to, do, is, to, get, clear, about, what, am, i, to, do, not, what, i, must, know, he, wanted, to, lead, a, completely, human, life, and, not, merely, one, of, knowledge, kierkegaard, didn, t, want, to, be, a, philosopher, in, the, traditional, or, hegelian, sense, and, he, didn, t, want, to, preach, a, christianity, that, was, an, illusion, but, he, had, learned, from, his, father, that, one, can, do, what, one, wills, and, his, father, s, life, had, not, discredited, this, theory, one, of, the, first, physical, descriptions, of, kierkegaard, comes, from, an, attendee, hans, br, chner, at, his, brother, peter, s, wedding, party, in, 1836, i, found, almost, comical, he, was, then, twenty, three, years, old, he, had, something, quite, irregular, in, his, entire, form, and, had, a, strange, coiffure, his, hair, rose, almost, six, inches, above, his, forehead, into, a, tousled, crest, that, gave, him, a, strange, bewildered, look, another, comes, from, kierkegaard, s, niece, henriette, lund, 1829, 1909, when, s, ren, kierkegaard, was, a, little, boy, he, was, of, slender, and, delicate, appearance, and, ran, about, in, a, little, coat, of, red, cabbage, color, he, used, to, be, called, fork, by, his, father, because, of, his, tendency, developed, quite, early, toward, satirical, remarks, although, a, serious, almost, austere, tone, pervaded, the, kierkegaards, house, i, have, the, firm, impression, that, there, was, a, place, for, youthful, vivacity, too, even, though, of, a, more, sedate, and, home, made, kind, than, one, is, used, to, nowadays, the, house, was, open, for, an, old, fashioned, hospitality, he, was, also, described, quaintly, attired, slight, and, small, kierkegaard, s, mother, was, a, nice, little, woman, with, an, even, and, happy, disposition, according, to, a, grandchild, s, description, she, was, never, mentioned, in, kierkegaard, s, works, ane, died, on, 31, july, 1834, age, 66, possibly, from, typhus, his, father, died, on, 8, august, 1838, age, 82, on, 11, august, kierkegaard, wrote, my, father, died, on, wednesday, the, 8th, at, 2, 00, a, m, i, so, deeply, desired, that, he, might, have, lived, a, few, years, more, right, now, i, feel, there, is, only, one, person, e, boesen, with, whom, i, can, really, talk, about, him, he, was, a, faithful, friend, troels, frederik, lund, his, nephew, was, instrumental, in, providing, biographers, with, much, information, regarding, s, ren, kierkegaard, lund, was, a, good, friend, of, georg, brandes, and, julius, lange, here, is, an, anecdote, about, his, father, from, kierkegaard, s, journals, at, lunch, one, day, i, overturned, a, salt, shaker, passionate, as, he, was, and, intense, as, he, easily, could, become, he, began, to, scold, so, severely, that, he, even, said, that, i, was, a, prodigal, and, things, like, that, then, i, made, an, objection, reminding, him, of, an, old, episode, in, the, family, when, my, sister, nicoline, had, dropped, a, very, expensive, tureen, and, father, had, not, said, a, word, but, pretended, it, was, nothing, at, all, he, replied, well, you, see, it, was, such, an, expensive, thing, that, no, scolding, was, needed, she, realized, quite, well, that, it, was, wrong, but, precisely, when, it, is, a, trifle, there, must, be, a, scolding, journals, x3a78, according, to, samuel, hugo, bergmann, kierkegaard, s, journals, are, one, of, the, most, important, sources, for, an, understanding, of, his, philosophy, kierkegaard, wrote, over, 7, 000, pages, in, his, journals, on, events, musings, thoughts, about, his, works, and, everyday, remarks, the, entire, collection, of, danish, journals, journalen, was, edited, and, published, in, 13, volumes, consisting, of, 25, separate, bindings, including, indices, the, first, english, edition, of, the, journals, was, edited, by, alexander, dru, in, 1938, the, style, is, literary, and, poetic, manner, kierkegaard, wanted, to, have, regine, his, fianc, e, see, below, as, his, confidant, but, considered, it, an, impossibility, for, that, to, happen, so, he, left, it, to, my, reader, that, single, individual, to, become, his, confidant, his, question, was, whether, or, not, one, can, have, a, spiritual, confidant, he, wrote, the, following, in, his, concluding, postscript, with, regard, to, the, essential, truth, a, direct, relation, between, spirit, and, spirit, is, unthinkable, if, such, a, relation, is, assumed, it, actually, means, that, the, party, has, ceased, to, be, spirit, kierkegaard, s, journals, were, the, source, of, many, aphorisms, credited, to, the, philosopher, the, following, passage, from, 1, august, 1835, is, perhaps, his, most, oft, quoted, aphorism, and, a, key, quote, for, existentialist, studies, what, i, really, need, is, to, get, clear, about, what, i, must, do, not, what, i, must, know, except, insofar, as, knowledge, must, precede, every, act, what, matters, is, to, find, a, purpose, to, see, what, it, really, is, that, god, wills, that, i, shall, do, the, crucial, thing, is, to, find, a, truth, which, is, truth, for, me, to, find, the, idea, for, which, i, am, willing, to, live, and, die, he, wrote, this, way, about, indirect, communication, in, the, same, journal, entry, one, must, first, learn, to, know, himself, before, knowing, anything, else, not, until, a, man, has, inwardly, understood, himself, and, then, sees, the, course, he, is, to, take, does, his, life, gain, peace, and, meaning, only, then, is, he, free, of, that, irksome, sinister, traveling, companion, that, irony, of, life, which, manifests, itself, in, the, sphere, of, knowledge, and, invites, true, knowing, to, begin, with, a, not, knowing, socrates, just, as, god, created, the, world, from, nothing, but, in, the, waters, of, morality, it, is, especially, at, home, to, those, who, still, have, not, entered, the, tradewinds, of, virtue, here, it, tumbles, a, person, about, in, a, horrible, way, for, a, time, lets, him, feel, happy, and, content, in, his, resolve, to, go, ahead, along, the, right, path, then, hurls, him, into, the, abyss, of, despair, often, it, lulls, a, man, to, sleep, with, the, thought, after, all, things, cannot, be, otherwise, only, to, awaken, him, suddenly, to, a, rigorous, interrogation, frequently, it, seems, to, let, a, veil, of, forgetfulness, fall, over, the, past, only, to, make, every, single, trifle, appear, in, a, strong, light, again, when, he, struggles, along, the, right, path, rejoicing, in, having, overcome, temptation, s, power, there, may, come, at, almost, the, same, time, right, on, the, heels, of, perfect, victory, an, apparently, insignificant, external, circumstance, which, pushes, him, down, like, sisyphus, from, the, height, of, the, crag, often, when, a, person, has, concentrated, on, something, a, minor, external, circumstance, arises, which, destroys, everything, as, in, the, case, of, a, man, who, weary, of, life, is, about, to, throw, himself, into, the, thames, and, at, the, crucial, moment, is, halted, by, the, sting, of, a, mosquito, frequently, a, person, feels, his, very, best, when, the, illness, is, the, worst, as, in, tuberculosis, in, vain, he, tries, to, resist, it, but, he, has, not, sufficient, strength, and, it, is, no, help, to, him, that, he, has, gone, through, the, same, thing, many, times, the, kind, of, practice, acquired, in, this, way, does, not, apply, here, although, his, journals, clarify, some, aspects, of, his, work, and, life, kierkegaard, took, care, not, to, reveal, too, much, abrupt, changes, in, thought, repetitive, writing, and, unusual, turns, of, phrase, are, some, among, the, many, tactics, he, used, to, throw, readers, off, track, consequently, there, are, many, varying, interpretations, of, his, journals, kierkegaard, did, not, doubt, the, importance, his, journals, would, have, in, the, future, in, december, 1849, he, wrote, were, i, to, die, now, the, effect, of, my, life, would, be, exceptional, much, of, what, i, have, simply, jotted, down, carelessly, in, the, journals, would, become, of, great, importance, and, have, a, great, effect, for, then, people, would, have, grown, reconciled, to, me, and, would, be, able, to, grant, me, what, was, and, is, my, right, an, important, aspect, of, kierkegaard, s, life, generally, considered, to, have, had, a, major, influence, on, his, work, was, his, broken, engagement, to, regine, olsen, 1822, 1904, kierkegaard, and, olsen, met, on, 8, may, 1837, and, were, instantly, attracted, to, each, other, but, sometime, around, 11, august, 1838, he, had, second, thoughts, in, his, journals, kierkegaard, wrote, idealistically, about, his, love, for, her, on, 8, september, 1840, kierkegaard, formally, proposed, to, olsen, he, soon, felt, disillusioned, about, his, prospects, he, broke, off, the, engagement, on, 11, august, 1841, though, it, is, generally, believed, that, the, two, were, deeply, in, love, in, his, journals, kierkegaard, mentions, his, belief, that, his, melancholy, made, him, unsuitable, for, marriage, but, his, precise, motive, for, ending, the, engagement, remains, unclear, later, on, he, wrote, i, owe, everything, to, the, wisdom, of, an, old, man, and, to, the, simplicity, of, a, young, girl, the, old, man, in, this, statement, is, said, to, be, his, father, while, olsen, was, the, girl, martin, buber, said, kierkegaard, does, not, marry, in, defiance, of, the, whole, nineteenth, century, kierkegaard, then, turned, his, attention, to, his, examinations, on, 13, may, 1839, he, wrote, i, have, no, alternative, than, to, suppose, that, it, is, god, s, will, that, i, prepare, for, my, examination, and, that, it, is, more, pleasing, to, him, that, i, do, this, than, actually, coming, to, some, clearer, perception, by, immersing, myself, in, one, or, another, sort, of, research, for, obedience, is, more, precious, to, him, than, the, fat, of, rams, the, death, of, his, father, and, the, death, of, poul, m, ller, also, played, a, part, in, his, decision, on, 29, september, 1841, kierkegaard, wrote, and, defended, his, master, s, thesis, on, the, concept, of, irony, with, continual, reference, to, socrates, the, university, panel, considered, it, noteworthy, and, thoughtful, but, too, informal, and, witty, for, a, serious, academic, thesis, the, thesis, dealt, with, irony, and, schelling, s, 1841, lectures, which, kierkegaard, had, attended, with, mikhail, bakunin, jacob, burckhardt, and, friedrich, engels, each, had, come, away, with, a, different, perspective, kierkegaard, graduated, from, university, on, 20, october, 1841, with, a, magister, artium, master, of, arts, his, family, s, inheritance, of, approximately, 31, 000, rigsdaler, enabled, him, to, fund, his, work, and, living, expenses, including, servants, kierkegaard, published, some, of, his, works, using, pseudonyms, and, for, others, he, signed, his, own, name, as, author, whether, being, published, under, pseudonym, or, not, kierkegaard, s, central, writing, on, religion, was, fear, and, trembling, and, either, or, is, considered, to, be, his, magnum, opus, pseudonyms, were, used, often, in, the, early, 19th, century, as, a, means, of, representing, viewpoints, other, than, the, author, s, own, kierkegaard, employed, the, same, technique, as, a, way, to, provide, examples, of, indirect, communication, in, writing, under, various, pseudonyms, to, express, sometimes, contradictory, positions, kierkegaard, is, sometimes, criticized, for, playing, with, various, viewpoints, without, ever, committing, to, one, in, particular, he, has, been, described, by, those, opposing, his, writings, as, indeterminate, in, his, standpoint, as, a, writer, though, he, himself, has, testified, to, all, his, work, deriving, from, a, service, to, christianity, after, on, the, concept, of, irony, with, continual, reference, to, socrates, his, 1841, master, s, thesis, under, frederik, christian, sibbern, he, wrote, his, first, book, under, the, pseudonym, johannes, climacus, after, john, climacus, between, 1841, and, 1842, de, omnibus, dubitandum, est, latin, everything, must, be, doubted, was, not, published, until, after, his, death, kierkegaard, s, magnum, opus, either, or, was, published, 20, february, 1843, it, was, mostly, written, during, kierkegaard, s, stay, in, berlin, where, he, took, notes, on, schelling, s, philosophy, of, revelation, either, or, includes, essays, of, literary, and, music, criticism, and, a, set, of, romantic, like, aphorisms, as, part, of, his, larger, theme, of, examining, the, reflective, and, philosophical, structure, of, faith, edited, by, victor, eremita, the, book, contained, the, papers, of, an, unknown, a, and, b, which, the, pseudonymous, author, claimed, to, have, discovered, in, a, secret, drawer, of, his, secretary, eremita, had, a, hard, time, putting, the, papers, of, a, in, order, because, they, were, not, straightforward, b, s, papers, were, arranged, in, an, orderly, fashion, both, of, these, characters, are, trying, to, become, religious, individuals, each, approached, the, idea, of, first, love, from, an, aesthetic, and, an, ethical, point, of, view, the, book, is, basically, an, argument, about, faith, and, marriage, with, a, short, discourse, at, the, end, telling, them, they, should, stop, arguing, eremita, thinks, b, a, judge, makes, the, most, sense, kierkegaard, stressed, the, how, of, christianity, as, well, as, the, how, of, book, reading, in, his, works, rather, than, the, what, three, months, after, the, publication, of, either, or, 16, may, 1843, he, published, two, upbuilding, discourses, 1843, and, continued, to, publish, discourses, along, with, his, pseudonymous, books, these, discourses, were, published, under, kierkegaard, s, own, name, and, are, available, as, eighteen, upbuilding, discourses, today, david, f, swenson, first, translated, the, works, in, the, 1940s, and, titled, them, the, edifying, discourses, however, in, 1990, howard, v, and, edna, h, hong, translated, the, works, again, but, called, them, the, upbuilding, discourses, the, word, upbuilding, was, more, in, line, with, kierkegaard, s, thought, after, 1846, when, he, wrote, christian, deliberations, about, works, of, love, an, upbuilding, discourse, or, edifying, discourse, isn, t, the, same, as, a, sermon, because, a, sermon, is, preached, to, a, congregation, while, a, discourse, can, be, carried, on, between, several, people, or, even, with, oneself, the, discourse, or, conversation, should, be, upbuilding, which, means, one, would, build, up, the, other, person, or, oneself, rather, than, tear, down, to, build, up, kierkegaard, said, although, this, little, book, which, is, called, discourses, not, sermons, because, its, author, does, not, have, authority, to, preach, upbuilding, discourses, not, discourses, for, upbuilding, because, the, speaker, by, no, means, claims, to, be, a, teacher, wishes, to, be, only, what, it, is, a, superfluity, and, desires, only, to, remain, in, hiding, on, 16, october, 1843, kierkegaard, published, three, more, books, about, love, and, faith, and, several, more, discourses, fear, and, trembling, was, published, under, the, pseudonym, johannes, de, silentio, repetition, is, about, a, young, man, s, ren, kierkegaard, who, has, anxiety, and, depression, because, he, feels, he, has, to, sacrifice, his, love, for, a, girl, regine, olsen, to, god, he, tries, to, see, if, the, new, science, of, psychology, can, help, him, understand, himself, constantin, constantius, who, is, the, pseudonymous, author, of, that, book, is, the, psychologist, at, the, same, time, he, published, three, upbuilding, discourses, 1843, under, his, own, name, which, dealt, specifically, with, how, love, can, be, used, to, hide, things, from, yourself, or, others, these, three, books, all, published, on, the, same, day, are, an, example, of, kierkegaard, s, method, of, indirect, communication, kierkegaard, questioned, whether, an, individual, can, know, if, something, is, a, good, gift, from, god, or, not, and, concludes, by,

bringing, forth, and, insofar, as, it, is, that, how, the, observer, himself, is, constituted, is, indeed, decisive, god, s, love, is, imparted, indirectly, just, as, our, own, sometimes, is, during, 1844, he, published, two, three, and, four, more, upbuilding, discourses, just, as, he, did, in, 1843, but, here, he, discussed, how, an, individual, might, come, to, know, god, theologians, philosophers, and, historians, were, all, engaged, in, debating, about, the, existence, of, god, this, is, direct, communication, and, kierkegaard, thinks, this, might, be, useful, for, theologians, philosophers, and, historians, associations, but, not, at, all, useful, for, the, single, individual, who, is, interested, in, becoming, a, christian, kierkegaard, always, wrote, for, that, single, individual, whom, i, with, joy, and, gratitude, call, my, reader, the, single, individual, must, put, what, is, understood, to, use, or, it, will, be, lost, reflection, can, take, an, individual, only, so, far, before, the, imagination, begins, to, change, the, whole, content, of, what, was, being, thought, about, love, is, won, by, being, exercised, just, as, much, as, faith, and, patience, are, he, also, wrote, several, more, pseudonymous, books, in, 1844, philosophical, fragments, prefaces, and, the, concept, of, anxiety, and, finished, the, year, up, with, four, upbuilding, discourses, 1844, he, used, indirect, communication, in, the, first, book, and, direct, communication, in, the, rest, of, them, he, doesn, t, believe, the, question, about, god, s, existence, should, be, an, opinion, held, by, one, group, and, differently, by, another, no, matter, how, many, demonstrations, are, made, he, says, it, s, up, to, the, single, individual, to, make, the, fruit, of, the, holy, spirit, real, because, love, and, joy, are, always, just, possibilities, christendom, wanted, to, define, god, s, attributes, once, and, for, all, but, kierkegaard, was, against, this, his, love, for, regine, was, a, disaster, but, it, helped, him, because, of, his, point, of, view, kierkegaard, believed, each, generation, has, its, own, task, and, need, not, trouble, itself, unduly, by, being, everything, to, previous, and, succeeding, generations, in, an, earlier, book, he, had, said, to, a, certain, degree, every, generation, and, every, individual, begins, his, life, from, the, beginning, and, in, another, no, generation, has, learned, to, love, from, another, no, generation, is, able, to, begin, at, any, other, point, than, the, beginning, no, generation, learns, the, essentially, human, from, a, previous, one, and, finally, in, 1850, he, wrote, those, true, christians, who, in, every, generation, live, a, life, contemporaneous, with, that, of, christ, have, nothing, whatsoever, to, do, with, christians, of, the, preceding, generation, but, all, the, more, with, their, contemporary, christ, his, life, here, on, earth, attends, every, generation, and, every, generation, severally, as, sacred, history, but, in, 1848, the, whole, generation, and, every, individual, in, the, generation, is, a, participant, in, one, s, having, faith, he, was, against, the, hegelian, idea, of, mediation, because, it, introduces, a, third, term, that, comes, between, the, single, individual, and, the, object, of, desire, kierkegaard, wrote, in, 1844, if, a, person, can, be, assured, of, the, grace, of, god, without, needing, temporal, evidence, as, a, middleman, or, as, the, dispensation, advantageous, to, him, as, interpreter, then, it, is, indeed, obvious, to, him, that, the, grace, of, god, is, the, most, glorious, of, all, he, was, against, mediation, and, settled, instead, on, the, choice, to, be, content, with, the, grace, of, god, or, not, it, s, the, choice, between, the, possibility, of, the, temporal, and, the, eternal, mistrust, and, belief, and, deception, and, truth, subjective, and, objective, these, are, the, magnitudes, of, choice, he, always, stressed, deliberation, and, choice, in, his, writings, and, wrote, against, comparison, this, is, how, kant, put, it, in, 1786, and, kierkegaard, put, it, in, 1847, thinking, for, one, s, self, is, to, seek, the, chief, touchstone, of, truth, in, one, s, self, id, est, in, one, s, own, reason, and, the, maxim, to, think, for, one, s, self, at, all, times, is, enlightening, thereto, belongs, not, just, so, much, as, those, may, imagine, who, take, knowledge, to, be, enlightening, as, it, is, rather, a, negative, principle, in, the, use, of, one, s, cognoscitive, faculty, and, he, who, is, very, rich, in, knowledge, is, often, the, least, enlightened, in, the, use, of, it, to, exercise, one, s, own, reason, means, nothing, more, than, relatively, to, every, thing, which, one,

the, invitation, to, learn, from, the, lilies, be, welcome, to, everyone, just, as, the, reminder, is, useful, to, him, alas, those, great, uplifting, simple, thoughts, those, first, thoughts, are, more, and, more, forgotten, perhaps, entirely, forgotten, in, the, weekday, and, worldly, life, of, comparisons, the, one, human, being, compares, himself, with, others, the, one, generation, compares, itself, with, the, other, and, thus, the, heaped, up, pile, of, comparisons, overwhelms, a, person, as, the, ingenuity, and, busyness, increase, there, come, to, be, more, and, more, in, each, generation, who, slavishly, work, a, whole, lifetime, far, down, in, the, low, underground, regions, of, comparisons, indeed, just, as, miners, never, see, the, light, of, day, so, these, unhappy, people, never, come, to, see, the, light, those, uplifting, simple, thoughts, those, first, thoughts, about, how, glorious, it, is, to, be, a, human, being, and, up, there, in, the, higher, regions, of, comparison, smiling, vanity, plays, its, false, game, and, deceives, the, happy, ones, so, that, they, receive, no, impression, from, those, lofty, simple, thoughts, those, first,

an, infinite, difference, since, the, latter, has, no, intimation, of, the, secret, of, the, metaphorical, words, although, he, is, using, the, same, words, but, not, in, their, metaphorical, sense,

then, only, cursorily, concerns, himself, with, his, relationship, to, god, hardly, thinks, or, dreams, that, he, has, so, closely, to, do, with, god, or, that, god, is, so, close, to, him, that,

stated, that, he, was, a, religious, author, throughout, all, of, his, writings, and, that, his, aim, was, to, discuss, the, problem, of, becoming, a, christian, with, a, direct, polemic, against, the, monstrous, illusion, we, call, christendom, he, expressed, the, illusion, this, way, in, his, 1848, christian, address, thoughts, which, wound, from, behind, for, edification, oh, in, the, customary, course, of, life, there, is, so, much, to, lull, a, man, to, sleep, to, teach, him, to, say, peace, and, no, danger, it, is, for, this, cause, we, go, into, the, house, of, god, to, be, awakened, out, of, sleep, and, to, be, riven, away, from, the, enchantments, but, then, again, when, there, is, so, much, in, the, house, of, god, to, lull, us, even, that, which, in, itself, is, arousing, such, as, thoughts, reflections, ideas, can, by, custom, and, monotony, lose, all, their, significance, just, as, a, spring, can, lose, the, resilience, which, makes, it, what, it, is, so, then, to, approach, nearer, to, the, subject, of, this, discourse, it, is, right, reasonable, and, a, plain, duty, to, invite, men, over, and, over, again, to, come, to, the, house, of, the, lord, to, summon, them, to, it, but, one, may, become, so, accustomed, to, hearing, this, invitation, that, one, may, lose, all, sense, of, its, significance, so, that, at, last, one, steps, away, and, it, ends, with, the, invitation, preaching, the, church, empty, or, one, may, become, so, accustomed, to, hearing, this, invitation, that, it, develops, false, ideas, in, those, that, come, makes, us, self, important, in, our, own, thoughts, that, we, are, not, as, they, who, remain, away, makes, us, self, satisfied, secure, because, it, envelops, us, in, a, delusion, as, though, since, we, are, so, urgently, invited, god, were, in, need, of, us, as, though, it, were, not, we, who, in, fear, and, trembling, should, reflect, what, he, may, require, of, us, as, though, it, were, not, we, who, should, sincerely, thank, god, that, he, will, have, dealings, with, us, that, he, will, suffer, and, permit, us, to, approach, him, suffer, that, we, presume, to, believe, that, he, cares, for, us,

abyss, there, were, a, spot, however, little, where, i, could, stand, while, the, consciousness, of, my, sin, must, remain, on, the, other, side, would, that, there, were, a, forgiveness, a, forgiveness, that, does, not, increase, my, sense, of, guilt, but, truly, takes, the, guilt, from, me, also, the, consciousness, of, it, would, that, there, were, oblivion, but, now, this, is, indeed, that, way, it, is, because, love, christ, s, love, hides, a, multitude, of, sins, behold, everything, has, become, new, a, human, being, has, no, authority, cannot, command, that, you, shall, believe, and, just, by, commanding, you, with, authority, help, you, to, believe, but, if, it, requires, authority, even, to, teach, what, authority, is, required, even, greater, if, possible, then, the, authority, that, commands, the, heaving, sea, to, be, still, to, command, the, despairing, person, the, one, who, in, the, agony, of, repentance, is, unable, and, does, not, dare, to, forget, the, prostrate, penitent, who, is, unable, and, does, not, dare, to, stop, staring, at, his, guilt, what, authority, is, required, to, command, him, to, shut, his, eyes, and, what, authority, is, then, required, to, command, him, to, open, the, eyes, of, faith, so, that, he, sees, purity, where, he, saw, guilt, and, sin, that, divine, authority, he, alone, has, jesus, christ, whose, love, hides, a, multitude, of, sins, he, hides, it, very, literally, just, as, when, one, person, places, himself, in, front, of, another, person, and, covers, him, so, completely, with, his, body, that, no, one, no, one, can, see, the, person, hidden, behind, him, so, jesus, christ, covers, your, sin, with, his, holy, body, kierkegaard, began, his, 1843, book, either, or, with, a, question, are, passions, then, the, pagans, of, the, soul, reason, alone, baptized, he, didn, t, want, to, devote, himself, to, thought, or, speculation, like, hegel, did, faith, hope, love, peace, patience, joy, self, control, vanity, kindness, humility, courage, cowardliness, pride, deceit, and, selfishness, these, are, the, inner, passions, that, thought, knows, little, about, hegel, begins, the, process, of, education, with, thought, but, kierkegaard, thinks, we, could, begin, with, passion, or, a, balance, between, the, two, a, balance, between, goethe, and, hegel, he, was, against, endless, reflection, with, no, passion, involved, but, at, the, same, time, he, did, not, want, to, draw, more, attention, to, the, external, display, of, passion, but, the, internal, hidden, passion, of, the, single, individual, kierkegaard, clarified, this, intention, in, his, journals, schelling, put, nature, first, and, hegel, put, reason, first, but, kierkegaard, put, the, human, being, first, and, the, choice, first, in, his, writings, he, makes, an, argument, against, nature, here, and, points, out, that, most, single, individuals, begin, life, as, spectators, of, the, visible, world, and, work, toward, knowledge, of, the, invisible, world, is, it, a, perfection, on, the, part, of, the, bird, that, in, hard, times, it, sits, and, dies, of, hunger, and, knows, of, nothing, at, all, to, do, that, dazed, it, lets, itself, fall, to, the, ground, and, dies, usually, we, do, not, talk, this, way, when, a, sailor, lies, down, in, the, boat, and, lets, matters, take, their, course, in, the, storm, and, knows, nothing, to, do, we, do, not, speak, of, his, perfection, but, when, a, doughty, sailor, knows, how, to, steer, when, he, works, against, the, storm, with, ingenuity, with, strength, and, with, perseverance, when, he, works, himself, out, of, the, danger, we, admire, him, suppose, that, it, were, not, one, man, who, traveled, from, jericho, to, jerusalem, but, there, were, two, and, both, of, them, were, assaulted, by, robbers, and, maimed, and, no, traveler, passed, by, suppose, then, that, one, of, them, did, nothing, but, moan, while, the, other, forgot, and, surmounted, his, own, suffering, to, speak, comfortingly, friendly, words, or, what, involved, great, pain, dragged, himself, to, some, water, to, fetch, the, other, a, refreshing, drink, or, suppose, that, they, were, both, bereft, of, speech, but, one, of, them, in, his, silent, prayer, sighed, to, god, also, for, the, other, was, he, then, not, merciful, if, someone, has, cut, off, my, hands, then, i, cannot,

to, the, world, no, thou, shalt, first, seek, god, s, kingdom, but, then, in, a, certain, sense, it, is, nothing, i, shall, do, yes, certainly, in, a, certain, it, is, nothing, thou, shalt, in, the, deepest, sense, make, thyself, nothing, become, nothing, before, god, learn, to, keep, silent, in, this, silence, is, the, beginning, which, is, first, to, seek, god, s, kingdom, in, this, wise, a, godly, wise, one, gets, to, the, beginning, by, going, in, a, sense, backwards, the, beginning, is, not, that, with, which, one, begins, but, at, which, one, arrives, at, the, beginning, backwards, the, beginning, is, this, art, of, becoming, silent, for, to, be, silent, as, nature, is, is, not, an, art, it, is, man, s, superiority, over, the, beasts, to, be, able, to, speak, but, in, relation, to, god, it, can, easily, become, the, ruin, of, man, who, is, able, to, speak, that, he, is, too, willing, to, speak, god, is, love, man, is, as, one, says, to, a, child, a, silly, little, thing, even, so, far, as, his, own, wellbeing, is, concerned, only, in, much, fear, and, trembling, can, a, man, walk, with, god, in, much, fear, and, trembling, but, to, talk, in, much, fear, and, trembling, is, difficult, for, as, a, sense, of, dread, causes, the, bodily, voice, to, fail, so, also, does, much, fear, and, trembling, render, the, voice, mute, in, silence, this, the, true, man,

authentic, truth, witnesses, kierkegaard, explained, in, his, first, article, that, mynster, s, death, permitted, him, at, last, to, be, frank, about, his, opinions, he, later, wrote, that, all, his, former, output, had, been, preparations, for, this, attack, postponed, for, years, waiting, for, two, preconditions, 1, both, his, father, and, bishop, mynster, should, be, dead, before, the, attack, and, 2, he, should, himself, have, acquired, a, name, as, a, famous, theologic, writer, kierkegaard, s, father, had, been, mynster, s, close, friend, but, s, ren, had, long, come, to, see, that, mynster, s, conception, of, christianity, was, mistaken, demanding, too, little, of, its, adherents, kierkegaard, strongly, objected, to, the, portrayal, of, mynster, as, a, truth, witness, kierkegaard, described, the, hope, the, witness, to, the, truth, has, in, 1847, and, in, his, journals, when, the, concepts, are, shaken, in, an, upheaval, that, is, more, terrible, than, an, earthquake, when, the, truth, is, hated, and, its, witness, persecuted, what, then, must, the, witness, submit, to, the, world, yes, but, does, that, mean, all, is, lost, no, on, the, contrary, we, remain, convinced, of, this, and, thus, no, proof, is, needed, for, if, it, is, not, so, then, such, a, person, is, not, a, witness, to, the, truth, either, therefore, we, are, reassured, that, even, in, the, last, moments, such, a, person, has, retained, a, youthful, recollection, of, what, the, youth, expected, and, he, therefore, has, examined, himself, and, his, relationship, before, god, to, see, whether, the, defect, could, lie, in, him, whether, it, was, not, possible, for, it, to, become, as, the, youth, had, expected, something, he, perhaps, now, desired, most, for, the, sake, of, the, world, namely, that, truth, has, the, victory, and, good, has, its, reward, in, the, world, woe, to, the, one, who, presumptuously, precipitously, and, impetuously, brings, the, horror, of, confusion, into, more, peaceable, situations, but, woe, also, to, the, one, who, if, it, was, necessary, did, not, have, the, bold, confidence, to, turn, everything, around, the, second, time, when,

christians, are, disinclined, from, taking, the, initiative, to, take, responsibility, for, their, own, relation, to, god, he, stressed, that, christianity, is, the, individual, here, the, single,

of, its, members, more, members, would, mean, more, power, for, the, clergymen, a, corrupt, ideal, this, mission, would, seem, at, odds, with, christianity, s, true, doctrine, which, to, kierkegaard, is, to, stress, the, importance, of, the, individual, not, the, whole, thus, the, state, church, political, structure, is, offensive, and, detrimental, to, individuals, since, anyone, can, become, christian, without, knowing, what, it, means, to, be, christian, it, is, also, detrimental, to, the, religion, itself, since, it, reduces, christianity, to, a, mere, fashionable, tradition, adhered, to, by, unbelieving, believers, a, herd, mentality, of, the, population, so, to, speak, kierkegaard, always, stressed, the, importance, of, the, conscience, and, the, use, of, it, however, he, showed, marked, elements, of, convergence, with, the, medieval, catholicism, nonetheless, kierkegaard, has, been, described, as, profoundly, lutheran, before, the, tenth, issue, of, his, periodical, the,

political, officials, a, niche, in, society, who, were, clearly, not, representative, of, the, divine, he, told, emil, boesen, a, friend, since, childhood, who, kept, a, record, of, his, conversations, with, kierkegaard, that, his, life, had, been, one, of, immense, suffering, which, may, have, seemed, like, vanity, to, others, but, he, did, not, think, it, so, kierkegaard, died, in, frederiks, hospital, after, over, a, month, possibly, from, complications, from, a, fall, from, a, tree, in, his, youth, it, has, been, suggested, by, professor, kaare, weismann, and, philosopher,

has, been, made, prominent, viz, namely, that, there, exists, a, worldly, minded, clergy, that, many, things, in, the, church, are, rotten, that, all, need, daily, repentance, that, one, must, never, be, contented, with, the, existing, state, of, either, the, church, or, her, pastors, hans, martensen, was, the, subject, of, a, danish, article, dr, s, kierkegaard, against, dr, h, martensen, by, hans, peter, kofoed, hansen, 1813, 1893, that, was, published, in, 1856, untranslated, and, martensen, mentioned, him, extensively, in, christian, ethics, published, in, 1871, kierkegaard, s, assertion, is, therefore, perfectly, justifiable, that, with, the, category, of, the, individual, the, cause, of, christianity, must, stand, and, fall, that, without, this, category, pantheism, had, conquered, unconditionally, from, this, at, a, glance, it, may, be, seen, that, kierkegaard, ought, to, have, made, common, cause, with, those, philosophic, and, theological, writers, who, specially, desired, to, promote, the, principle, of, personality, as, opposed, to, pantheism, this, is, however, far, from, the, case, for, those, views, which, upheld, the, category, of, existence, and,

of, a, human, being, has, to, disappear, completely, in, his, one, sided, view, of, faith, as, the, highest, good, he, wrote, kierkegaard, can, only, find, true, christianity, in, entire,

is, turned, toward, the, good, but, is, moving, backward, further, and, further, away, from, it, with, every, renewed, intention, and, promise, it, looks, as, if, he, took, a, step, forward, and, yet, he, is, not, merely, standing, still, but, he, is, actually, taking, a, step, backward, the, intention, taken, in, vain, the, unfulfilled, promise, leaves, despondency, dejection, that, in, turn, perhaps, soon, blazes, up, into, an, even, more, vehement, intention, which, leaves, only, greater, listlessness, just, as, the, alcoholic, continually, needs, a, stronger, and, stronger, stimulant, in, order, to, become, intoxicated, likewise, the, one, who, has, become, addicted, to, promises, and, good, intentions, continually, needs, more, and, more, stimulation, in, order, to, go, backward, s, ren, kierkegaard, works, of, love, hong, pp, 93, 94, 1850, one, thing, james, did, have, in, common, with, kierkegaard, was, respect, for, the, single, individual, and, their, respective, comments, may, be, compared, in, direct, sequence, as, follows, a, crowd, is, indeed, made, up, of, single, individuals, it, must, therefore, be, in, everyone, s, power, to, become, what, he, is, a, single, individual, no, one, is, prevented, from, being, a, single, individual, no, one, unless, he, prevents, himself, by, becoming, many, to, become, a, crowd, to, gather, a, crowd, around, oneself, is, on, the, contrary, to, distinguish, life, from, life, even, the, most, well, meaning, one, who, talks, about, that, can, easily, offend, a, single, individual, in, his, book, a, pluralistic, universe, james, stated, that, individuality, outruns, all, classification, yet, we, insist, on, classifying, every, one, we, meet, under, some, general, label, as, these, heads, usually, suggest, prejudicial, associations, to, some, hearer, or, other, the, life, of, philosophy, largely, consists, of, resentments, at, the, classing, and, complaints, of, being, misunderstood, but, there, are, signs, of, clearing, up, for, which, both, oxford, and, harvard, are, partly, to, be, thanked, the, encyclopaedia, of, religion, and, ethics, had, an, article, about, kierkegaard, in, 1908, the, article, began, the, life, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, has, but, few, points, of, contact, with, the, external, world, but, there, were, in, particular, three, occurrences, a, broken, engagement, an, attack, by, a, comic, paper, and, the, use, of, a, word, by, h, l, martensen, which, must, be, referred, to, as, having, wrought, with, extraordinary, effect, upon, his, peculiarly, sensitive, and, high, strung, nature, the, intensity, of, his, inner, life, again, which, finds, expression, in, his, published, works, and, even, more, directly, in, his, notebooks, and, diaries, also, published, cannot, be, properly, understood, without, some, reference, to, his, father, friedrich, von, h, gel, wrote, about, kierkegaard, in, his, 1913, book, eternal, life, a, study, of, its, implications, and, applications, where, he, said, kierkegaard, the, deep, melancholy, strenuous, utterly, uncompromising, danish, religionist, is, a, spiritual, brother, of, the, great, frenchman, blaise, pascal, and, of, the, striking, english, tractarian, hurrell, froude, who, died, young, and, still, full, of, crudity, yet, left, an, abiding, mark, upon, all, who, knew, him, well, john, george, robertson, wrote, an, article, called, s, ren, kierkegaard, in, 1914, notwithstanding, the, fact, that, during, the, last, quarter, of, a, century, we, have, devoted, considerable, attention, to, the, literatures, of, the, north, the, thinker, and, man, of, letters, whose, name, stands, at, the, head, of, the, present, article, is, but, little, known, to, the, english, speaking, world, the, norwegians, ibsen, and, bj, rnson, have, exerted, a, very, real, power, on, our, intellectual, life, and, for, bj, rnson, we, have, cherished, even, a, kind, of, affection, but, kierkegaard, the, writer, who, holds, the, indispensable, key, to, the, intellectual, life, of, scandinavia, to, whom, denmark, in, particular, looks, up, as, her, most, original, man, of, genius, in, the, nineteenth, century, we, have, wholly, overlooked, robertson, wrote, previously, in, cosmopolis, 1898, about, kierkegaard, and, nietzsche, theodor, haecker, wrote, an, essay, titled, kierkegaard, and, the, philosophy, of, inwardness, in, 1913, and, david, f, swenson, wrote, a, biography, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, in, 1920, lee, m, hollander, translated, parts, of, either, or, fear, and, trembling, stages, on, life, s, way, and, preparations, for, the, christian, life, practice, in, christianity, into, english, in, 1923, with, little, impact, swenson, wrote, about, kierkegaard, s, idea, of, armed, neutrality, in, 1918, and, a, lengthy, article, about, s, ren, kierkegaard, in, 1920, swenson, stated, it, would, be, interesting, to, speculate, upon, the, reputation, that, kierkegaard, might, have, attained, and, the, extent, of, the, influence, he, might, have, exerted, if, he, had, written, in, one, of, the, major, european, languages, instead, of, in, the, tongue, of, one, of, the, smallest, countries, in, the, world, austrian, psychologist, wilhelm, stekel, 1868, 1940, referred, to, kierkegaard, as, the, fanatical, follower, of, don, juan, himself, the, philosopher, of, don, juanism, in, his, book, disguises, of, love, german, psychiatrist, and, philosopher, karl, jaspers, 1883, 1969, stated, he, had, been, reading, kierkegaard, since, 1914, and, compared, kierkegaard, s, writings, with, hegel, s, phenomenology, of, mind, and, the, writings, of, friedrich, nietzsche, jaspers, saw, kierkegaard, as, a, champion, of, christianity, and, nietzsche, as, a, champion, for, atheism, later, in, 1935, karl, jaspers, emphasized, kierkegaard, s, and, nietzsche, s, continuing, importance, for, modern, philosophy, albert, barthod, began, translating, kierkegaard, s, works, into, german, as, early, as, 1873, hermann, gottsche, published, kierkegaard, s, journals, in, 1905, it, had, taken, academics, 50, years, to, arrange, his, journals, kierkegaard, s, main, works, were, translated, into, german, by, christoph, schrempf, from, 1909, onwards, emmanuel, hirsch, released, a, german, edition, of, kierkegaard, s, collected, works, from, 1950, onwards, both, harald, hoffding, s, and, schrempf, s, books, about, kierkegaard, were, reviewed, in, 1892, in, the, 1930s, the, first, academic, english, translations, by, alexander, dru, david, f, swenson, douglas, v, steere, and, walter, lowrie, appeared, under, the, editorial, efforts, of, oxford, university, press, editor, charles, williams, one, of, the, members, of, the, inklings, thomas, henry, croxall, another, early, translator, lowrie, and, dru, all, hoped, that, people, would, not, just, read, about, kierkegaard, but, would, actually, read, his, works, dru, published, an, english, translation, of, kierkegaard, s, journals, in, 1958, alastair, hannay, translated, some, of, kierkegaard, s, works, from, the, 1960s, to, the, 1990s, howard, v, hong, and, edna, h, hong, translated, his, works, more, than, once, the, first, volume, of, their, first, version, of, the, journals, and, papers, indiana, 1967, 1978, won, the, 1968, u, s, national, book, award, in, category, translation, they, both, dedicated, their, lives, to, the, study, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, and, his, works, which, are, maintained, at, the, howard, v, and, edna, h, hong, kierkegaard, library, jon, stewart, from, the, university, of, copenhagen, has, written, extensively, about, s, ren, kierkegaard, kierkegaard, s, influence, on, karl, barth, s, early, theology, is, evident, in, the, epistle, to, the, romans, 1918, 1921, 1933, if, i, have, a, system, it, is, limited, to, a, recognition, of, what, kierkegaard, called, the, infinite, qualitative, distinction, and, to, my, regarding, this, as, possessing, negative, as, well, as, positive, significance, god, is, in, heaven, and, thou, art, on, earth, the, relation, between, such, a, god, and, such, a, man, and, the, relation, between, such, a, man, and, such, a, god, is, for, me, the, theme, of, the, bible, and, the, essence, of, philosophy, philosophers, name, this, krisis, of, human, perception, the, prime, cause, the, bible, holds, at, the, same, cross, roads, the, figure, of, jesus, christ, when, i, am, faced, by, such, a, document, as, the, epistle, of, paul, to, the, romans, i, embark, on, its, interpretation, on, the, assumption, that, he, is, confronted, with, the, same, unmistakable, and, unmeasurable, significance, of, that, relation, as, i, myself, am, confronted, with, and, that, it, is, this, situation, which, moulds, his, thought, and, its, expression, karl, barth, the, epistle, to, the, romans, 1919, preface, originally, published, in, german, barth, read, at, least, three, volumes, of, kierkegaard, s, works, practice, in, christianity, the, moment, and, an, anthology, from, his, journals, and, diaries, almost, all, key, terms, from, kierkegaard, which, had, an, important, role, in, the, epistle, to, the, romans, can, be, found, in, practice, in, christianity, the, concept, of, the, indirect, communication, the, paradox, and, the, moment, of, practice, in, christianity, in, particular, confirmed, and, sharpened, barth, s, ideas, on, contemporary, christianity, and, the, christian, life, it, was, in, his, study, of, paul, that, he, found, his, first, peace, of, mind, he, was, fascinated, by, the, revelation, of, the, power, of, the, holy, spirit, when, it, once, touched, a, man, at, the, completeness, with, which, it, overwhelms, and, keeps, its, chosen, ones, loyal, he, conceived, of, paul, as, one, upon, whom, god, had, laid, his, hand, barth, writes, the, man, paul, evidently, sees, and, hears, something, which, is, above, everything, which, is, absolutely, beyond, the, range, of, my, observation, and, measure, of, my, thought, following, this, observation, barth, too, became, a, listener, and, in, that, moment, was, born, the, theology, of, crisis, besides, affecting, barth, deeply, the, philosophy, of, kierkegaard, has, found, voice, in, the, works, of, ibsen, unamuno, and, heidegger, and, its, sphere, of, influence, seems, to, be, growing, in, ever, widening, circles, the, principle, contribution, of, kierkegaard, to, barth, is, the, dualism, of, time, and, eternity, which, kierkegaard, phrases, the, infinite, qualitative, difference, between, time, and, eternity, wilhelm, pauck, wrote, in, 1931, karl, barth, prophet, of, a, new, christianity, that, kierkegaard, s, use, of, the, latin, phrase, finitum, non, capax, infiniti, the, finite, does, not, or, cannot, comprehend, the, infinite, summed, up, barth, s, system, david, g, kingman, and, adolph, keller, each, discussed, barth, s, relationship, to, kierkegaard, in, their, books, the, religious, educational, values, in, karl, barth, s, teachings, 1934, and, karl, barth, and, christian, unity, 1933, keller, notes, the, splits, that, happen, when, a, new, teaching, is, introduced, and, some, assume, a, higher, knowledge, from, a, higher, source, than, others, students, of, kierkegaard, became, a, group, of, dissatisfied, excited, radicals, when, under, barthianism, eduard, geismar, 1871, 1939, who, gave, lectures, on, kierkegaard, in, march, 1936, was, not, radical, enough, for, them, barthianism, was, opposed, to, the, objective, treatment, of, religious, questions, and, to, the, sovereignty, of, man, in, the, existential, meeting, with, the, transcendent, god, but, just, as, students, of, hegel, broke, off, into, right, and, left, so, did, the, german, followers, of, barth, the, inward, distress, the, tension, and, the, preparation, of, kierkegaard, made, them, receptive, to, the, new, a, magazine, entitled, the, tidenverv, the, turn, of, the, times, has, been, their, journal, since, 1926, especially, the, student, christian, movement, became, the, port, of, invasion, for, the, new, thought, but, this, invasion, has, been, split, completely, into, two, camps, which, vehemently, attack, each, other, indictment, was, launched, against, the, old, theology, the, quiet, work, of, the, church, was, scorned, as, secularization, of, the, message, or, as, emotional, smugness, which, had, found, a, place, in, home, missions, despite, all, its, call, to, repentance, barth, endorses, the, main, theme, from, kierkegaard, but, also, reorganizes, the, scheme, and, transforms, the, details, he, expands, the, theory, of, indirect, communication, to, the, field, of, christian, ethics, he, applies, the, concept, of, unrecognizability, to, the, christian, life, he, coins, the, concept, of, the, paradox, of, faith, since, the, form, of, faith, entails, a, contradictory, encounter, of, god, and, human, beings, he, also, portrayed, the, contemporaneity, of, the, moment, when, in, crisis, a, human, being, desperately, perceives, the, contemporaneity, of, christ, in, regard, to, the, concept, of, indirect, communication, the, paradox, and, the, moment, the, kierkegaard, of, the, early, barth, is, a, productive, catalyst, william, hubben, compared, kierkegaard, to, dostoevsky, in, his, 1952, book, four, prophets, of, our, destiny, later, titled, dostoevsky, kierkegaard, nietzsche, and, kafka, logic, and, human, reasoning, are, inadequate, to, comprehend, truth, and, in, this, emphasis, dostoevsky, speaks, entirely, the, language, of, kierkegaard, of, whom, he, had, never, heard, christianity, is, a, way, of, life, an, existential, condition, again, like, kierkegaard, who, affirmed, that, suffering, is, the, climate, in, which, man, s, soul, begins, to, breathe, dostoevsky, stresses, the, function, of, suffering, as, part, of, god, s, revelation, of, truth, to, man, dostoevsky, kierkegaard, nietzsche, and, kafka, by, william, hubben, 1952, mcmillan, p, 83, in, 1955, morton, white, wrote, about, the, word, exists, and, kierkegaard, s, idea, of, god, s, is, ness, the, word, exists, is, one, of, the, most, pivotal, and, controversial, in, philosophy, some, philosophers, think, of, it, as, having, one, meaning, the, sense, in, which, we, say, that, this, book, exists, that, god, does, or, does, not, exist, that, there, exist, odd, numbers, between, 8, and, 20, that, a, characteristic, like, redness, exists, as, well, as, things, that, are, red, that, the, american, government, exists, as, well, as, the, physical, building, in, which, the, government, is, housed, that, minds, exist, as, well, as, bodies, and, when, the, word, exists, is, construed, in, this, unambiguous, way, many, famous, disputes, in, the, history, of, philosophy, and, theology, appear, to, be, quite, straightforward, theists, affirm, that, god, exists, while, atheists, deny, the, very, same, statement, materialists, say, that, matter, exists, while, some, idealists, think, that, it, is, illusory, nominalists, as, they, are, called, deny, the, existence, of, characteristics, like, redness, while, platonic, realists, affirm, it, some, kinds, of, behaviorists, deny, that, there, are, minds, inside, bodies, there, is, however, a, tendency, among, some, philosophers, to, insist, that, the, word, exists, is, ambiguous, and, therefore, that, some, of, these, disputes, are, not, disputes, at, all, but, merely, the, results, of, mutual, misunderstanding, of, a, failure, to, see, that, certain, things, are, said, to, exist, in, one, sense, while, others, exist, in, another, one, of, the, outstanding, efforts, of, this, kind, in, the, twentieth, century, occurs, in, the, early, writings, of, realists, who, maintained, that, only, concrete, things, in, space, and, time, exist, while, abstract, characteristics, of, things, or, relations, between, them, should, be, said, to, subsist, this, is, sometimes, illustrated, by, pointing, out, that, while, chicago, and, st, louis, both, exist, at, definite, places, the, relation, more, populous, than, which, holds, between, them, exists, neither, in, chicago, nor, in, st, louis, nor, in, the, area, between, them, but, is, nevertheless, something, about, which, we, can, speak, something, that, is, usually, assigned, to, a, timeless, and, spaceless, realm, like, that, of, which, plato, spoke, on, this, view, however, human, minds, or, personalities, are, also, said, to, exist, in, spite, of, being, non, material, in, short, the, great, divide, is, between, abstract, subsistents, and, concrete, existents, but, both, human, personalities, and, physical, objects, are, existents, and, do, not, share, in, the, spacelessness, and, timelessness, of, platonic, ideas, so, far, as, one, can, see, kierkegaard, too, distinguishes, different, senses, of, exists, except, that, he, appears, to, need, at, least, three, distinct, senses, for, which, he, should, supply, three, distinct, words, first, of, all, he, needs, one, for, statements, about, god, and, so, he, says, that, god, is, secondly, and, by, contrast, persons, or, personalities, are, said, to, exist, it, would, appear, then, that, he, needs, some, third, term, for, physical, objects, which, on, his, view, are, very, different, from, god, and, persons, but, since, existentialists, don, t, seem, to, be, very, interested, in, physical, objects, or, mere, things, they, appear, to, get, along, with, two, the, great, problem, for, kierkegaard, is, to, relate, god, s, is, ness, if, i, may, use, that, term, for, the, moment, to, human, existence, and, this, he, tries, to, solve, by, appealing, to, the, incarnation, christ, s, person, is, the, existent, outgrowth, of, god, who, is, by, what, is, admittedly, a, mysterious, process, the, abstract, god, enters, a, concrete, existent, we, must, accept, this, on, faith, and, faith, alone, for, clearly, it, cannot, be, like, the, process, whereby, one, existent, is, related, to, another, it, involves, a, passage, from, one, realm, to, another, which, is, not, accessible, to, the, human, mind, christians, who, lacked, this, faith, and, who, failed, to, live, by, it, were, attacked, by, kierkegaard, this, was, the, theological, root, of, his, violent, criticism, of, the, established, church, of, denmark, it, is, one, source, of, his, powerful, influence, on, contemporary, theology, john, daniel, wild, noted, as, early, as, 1959, that, kierkegaard, s, works, had, been, translated, into, almost, every, important, living, language, including, chinese, japanese, and, korean, and, it, is, now, fair, to, say, that, his, ideas, are, almost, as, widely, known, and, as, influential, in, the, world, as, those, of, his, great, opponent, hegel, still, the, most, potent, of, world, philosophers, mortimer, j, adler, wrote, the, following, about, kierkegaard, in, 1962, for, kierkegaard, man, is, essentially, an, individual, not, a, member, of, a, species, or, race, and, ethical, and, religious, truth, is, known, through, individual, existence, and, decision, through, subjectivity, not, objectivity, systems, of, thought, and, a, dialectic, such, as, hegel, s, are, matters, merely, of, thought, which, cannot, comprise, individual, existence, and, decision, such, systems, leave, out, said, kierkegaard, the, unique, and, essential, spermatic, point, the, individual, ethically, and, religiously, conceived, and, existentially, accentuated, similarly, in, the, works, of, the, american, author, henry, david, thoreau, writing, at, the, same, time, as, kierkegaard, there, is, an, emphasis, on, the, solitary, individual, as, the, bearer, of, ethical, responsibility, who, when, he, is, right, carries, the, preponderant, ethical, weight, against, the, state, government, and, a, united, public, opinion, when, they, are, wrong, the, solitary, individual, with, right, on, his, side, is, always, a, majority, of, one, ethics, the, study, of, moral, values, by, mortimer, j, adler, and, seymour, cain, pref, by, william, ernest, hocking, 1962, p, 252, in, 1964, life, magazine, traced, the, history, of, existentialism, from, heraclitus, 500bc, and, parmenides, over, the, argument, over, the, unchanging, one, as, the, real, and, the, state, of, flux, as, the, real, from, there, to, the, old, testament, psalms, and, then, to, jesus, and, later, from, jacob, boehme, 1575, 1624, to, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, and, blaise, pascal, 1623, 1662, and, then, on, to, nietzsche, and, paul, tillich, dostoevsky, and, camus, are, attempts, to, rewrite, descartes, according, to, their, own, lights, and, descartes, is, the, forefather, of, sartre, through, the, fact, that, they, both, used, a, literary, style, the, article, goes, on, to, say, but, the, orthodox, textbook, precursor, of, modern, existentialism, was, the, danish, theologian, s, ren, kierkegaard, 1813, 1855, a, lonely, hunchbacked, writer, who, denounced, the, established, church, and, rejected, much, of, the, then, popular, german, idealism, in, which, thought, and, ideas, rather, than, things, perceived, through, the, senses, were, held, to, constitute, reality, he, built, a, philosophy, based, in, part, on, the, idea, of, permanent, cleavage, between, faith, and, reason, this, was, an, existentialism, which, still, had, room, for, a, god, whom, sartre, later, expelled, but, which, started, the, great, pendulum, swing, toward, the, modern, concepts, of, the, absurd, kierkegaard, spent, his, life, thinking, existentially, and, converting, remarkably, few, to, his, ideas, but, when, it, comes, to, the, absurdity, of, existence, war, is, a, great, convincer, and, it, was, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, that, two, german, philosophers, karl, jaspers, and, martin, heidegger, took, up, kierkegaard, s, ideas, elaborated, and, systematized, them, by, the, 1930s, kierkegaard, s, thinking, made, new, impact, on, french, intellectuals, who, like, sartre, were, nauseated, by, the, static, pre, munich, hypocrisy, of, the, european, middle, class, after, world, war, ii, with, the, human, condition, more, precarious, than, ever, with, humanity, facing, the, mushroom, shaped, ultimate, absurdity, existentialism, and, our, time, came, together, in, jean, paul, sartre, kierkegaard, s, comparatively, early, and, manifold, philosophical, and, theological, reception, in, germany, was, one, of, the, decisive, factors, of, expanding, his, works, influence, and, readership, throughout, the, world, important, for, the, first, phase, of, his, reception, in, germany, was, the, establishment, of, the, journal, zwischen, den, zeiten, between, the, ages, in, 1922, by, a, heterogeneous, circle, of, protestant, theologians, karl, barth, emil, brunner, rudolf, bultmann, and, friedrich, gogarten, their, thought, would, soon, be, referred, to, as, dialectical, theology, at, roughly, the, same, time, kierkegaard, was, discovered, by, several, proponents, of, the, jewish, christian, philosophy, of, dialogue, in, germany, namely, by, martin, buber, ferdinand, ebner, and, franz, rosenzweig, in, addition, to, the, philosophy, of, dialogue, existential, philosophy, has, its, point, of, origin, in, kierkegaard, and, his, concept, of, individuality, martin, heidegger, sparsely, refers, to, kierkegaard, in, being, and, time, 1927, obscuring, how, much, he, owes, to, him, walter, kaufmann, discussed, sartre, jaspers, and, heidegger, in, relation, to, kierkegaard, and, kierkegaard, in, relation, to, the, crisis, of, religion, in, the, 1960s, later, kierkegaard, s, fear, and, trembling, series, two, and, the, sickness, unto, death, series, three, were, included, in, the, penguin, great, ideas, series, two, and, three, kierkegaard, has, been, called, a, philosopher, a, theologian, the, father, of, existentialism, both, atheistic, and, theistic, variations, a, literary, critic, a, social, theorist, a, humorist, a, psychologist, and, a, poet, two, of, his, influential, ideas, are, subjectivity, and, the, notion, popularly, referred, to, as, leap, of, faith, however, the, danish, equivalent, to, the, english, phrase, leap, of, faith, does, not, appear, in, the, original, danish, nor, is, the, english, phrase, found, in, current, english, translations, of, kierkegaard, s, works, kierkegaard, does, mention, the, concepts, of, faith, and, leap, together, many, times, in, his, works, the, leap, of, faith, is, his, conception, of, how, an, individual, would, believe, in, god, or, how, a, person, would, act, in, love, faith, is, not, a, decision, based, on, evidence, that, say, certain, beliefs, about, god, are, true, or, a, certain, person, is, worthy, of, love, no, such, evidence, could, ever, be, enough, to, completely, justify, the, kind, of, total, commitment, involved, in, true, religious, faith, or, romantic, love, faith, involves, making, that, commitment, anyway, kierkegaard, thought, that, to, have, faith, is, at, the, same, time, to, have, doubt, so, for, example, for, one, to, truly, have, faith, in, god, one, would, also, have, to, doubt, one, s, beliefs, about, god, the, doubt, is, the, rational, part, of, a, person, s, thought, involved, in, weighing, evidence, without, which, the, faith, would, have, no, real, substance, someone, who, does, not, realize, that, christian, doctrine, is, inherently, doubtful, and, that, there, can, be, no, objective, certainty, about, its, truth, does, not, have, faith, but, is, merely, credulous, for, example, it, takes, no, faith, to, believe, that, a, pencil, or, a, table, exists, when, one, is, looking, at, it, and, touching, it, in, the, same, way, to, believe, or, have, faith, in, god, is, to, know, that, one, has, no, perceptual, or, any, other, access, to, god, and, yet, still, has, faith, in, god, kierkegaard, writes, doubt, is, conquered, by, faith, just, as, it, is, faith, which, has, brought, doubt, into, the, world, kierkegaard, also, stresses, the, importance, of, the, self, and, the, self, s, relation, to, the, world, as, being, grounded, in, self, reflection, and, introspection, he, argued, in, concluding, unscientific, postscript, to, philosophical, fragments, that, subjectivity, is, truth, and, truth, is, subjectivity, this, has, to, do, with, a, distinction, between, what, is, objectively, true, and, an, individual, s, subjective, relation, such, as, indifference, or, commitment, to, that, truth, people, who, in, some, sense, believe, the, same, things, may, relate, to, those, beliefs, quite, differently, two, individuals, may, both, believe, that, many, of, those, around, them, are, poor, and, deserve, help, but, this, knowledge, may, lead, only, one, of, them, to, decide, to, actually, help, the, poor, this, is, how, kierkegaard, put, it, what, a, priceless, invention, statistics, are, what, a, glorious, fruit, of, culture, what, a, characteristic, counterpart, to, the, de, te, narratur, fabula, of, antiquity, schleiermacher, so, enthusiastically, declares, that, knowledge, does, not, perturb, religiousness, and, that, the, religious, person, does, not, sit, safeguarded, by, a, lightning, rod, and, scoff, at, god, yet, with, the, help, of, statistical, tables, one, laughs, at, all, of, life, in, other, words, kierkegaard, says, who, has, the, more, difficult, task, the, teacher, who, lectures, on, earnest, things, a, meteor, s, distance, from, everyday, life, or, the, learner, who, should, put, it, to, use, this, is, how, it, was, summed, up, in, 1940, kierkegaard, does, not, deny, the, fruitfulness, or, validity, of, abstract, thinking, science, logic, and, so, on, but, he, does, deny, any, superstition, which, pretends, that, abstract, theorizing, is, a, sufficient, concluding, argument, for, human, existence, he, holds, it, to, be, unforgivable, pride, or, stupidity, to, think, that, the, impersonal, abstraction, can, answer, the, vital, problems, of, human, everyday, life, logical, theorems, mathematical, symbols, physical, statistical, laws, can, never, become, patterns, of, human, existence, to, be, human, means, to, be, concrete, to, be, this, person, here, and, now, in, this, particular, and, decisive, moment, face, to, face, with, this, particular, challenge, kierkegaard, primarily, discusses, subjectivity, with, regard, to, religious, matters, as, already, noted, he, argues, that, doubt, is, an, element, of, faith, and, that, it, is, impossible, to, gain, any, objective, certainty, about, religious, doctrines, such, as, the, existence, of, god, or, the, life, of, christ, the, most, one, could, hope, for, would, be, the, conclusion, that, it, is, probable, that, the, christian, doctrines, are, true, but, if, a, person, were, to, believe, such, doctrines, only, to, the, degree, they, seemed, likely, to, be, true, he, or, she, would, not, be, genuinely, religious, at, all, faith, consists, in, a, subjective, relation, of, absolute, commitment, to, these, doctrines, kierkegaard, s, famous, philosophical, 20th, century, critics, include, theodor, adorno, and, emmanuel, levinas, non, religious, philosophers, such, as, jean, paul, sartre, and, martin, heidegger, supported, many, aspects, of, kierkegaard, s, philosophical, views, but, rejected, some, of, his, religious, views, one, critic, wrote, that, adorno, s, book, kierkegaard, construction, of, the, aesthetic, is, the, most, irresponsible, book, ever, written, on, kierkegaard, because, adorno, takes, kierkegaard, s, pseudonyms, literally, and, constructs, a, philosophy, that, makes, him, seem, incoherent, and, unintelligible, another, reviewer, says, that, adorno, is, from, the, more, credible, translations, and, interpretations, of, the, collected, works, of, kierkegaard, we, have, today, levinas, main, attack, on, kierkegaard, focused, on, his, ethical, and, religious, stages, especially, in, fear, and, trembling, levinas, criticises, the, leap, of, faith, by, saying, this, suspension, of, the, ethical, and, leap, into, the, religious, is, a, type, of, violence, the, leap, of, faith, of, course, is, presented, by, a, pseudonym, thus, not, representing, kierkegaard, s, own, view, but, intending, to, prompt, the, exact, kind, of, discussion, engaged, in, by, his, critics, he, states, kierkegaardian, violence, begins, when, existence, is, forced, to, abandon, the, ethical, stage, in, order, to, embark, on, the, religious, stage, the, domain, of, belief, but, belief, no, longer, sought, external, justification, even, internally, it, combined, communication, and, isolation, and, hence, violence, and, passion, that, is, the, origin, of, the, relegation, of, ethical, phenomena, to, secondary, status, and, the, contempt, of, the, ethical, foundation, of, being, which, has, led, through, nietzsche, to, the, amoralism, of, recent, philosophies, levinas, pointed, to, the, judeo, christian, belief, that, it, was, god, who, first, commanded, abraham, to, sacrifice, isaac, and, that, an, angel, commanded, abraham, to, stop, if, abraham, were, truly, in, the, religious, realm, he, would, not, have, listened, to, the, angel, s, command, and, should, have, continued, to, kill, isaac, to, levinas, transcending, ethics, seems, like, a, loophole, to, excuse, would, be, murderers, from, their, crime, and, thus, is, unacceptable, one, interesting, consequence, of, levinas, critique, is, that, it, seemed, to, reveal, that, levinas, viewed, god, as, a, projection, of, inner, ethical, desire, rather, than, an, absolute, moral, agent, however, one, of, kierkegaard, s, central, points, in, fear, and, trembling, was, that, the, religious, sphere, entails, the, ethical, sphere, abraham, had, faith, that, god, is, always, in, one, way, or, another, ethically, in, the, right, even, when, he, commands, someone, to, kill, therefore, deep, down, abraham, had, faith, that, god, as, an, absolute, moral, authority, would, never, allow, him, in, the, end, to, do, something, as, ethically, heinous, as, murdering, his, own, child, and, so, he, passed, the, test, of, blind, obedience, versus, moral, choice, he, was, making, the, point, that, god, as, well, as, the, god, man, christ, doesn, t, tell, people, everything, when, sending, them, out, on, a, mission, and, reiterated, this, in, stages, on, life, s, way, i, conceive, of, god, as, one, who, approves, in, a, calculated, vigilance, i, believe, that, he, approves, of, intrigues, and, what, i, have, read, in, the, sacred, books, of, the, old, testament, is, not, of, a, sort, to, dishearten, me, the, old, testament, furnishes, examples, abundantly, of, a, shrewdness, which, is, nevertheless, well, pleasing, to, god, and, that, at, a, later, period, christ, said, to, his, disciples, these, things, i, said, not, unto, you, from, the, beginning, i, have, yet, many, things, to, say, unto, you, but, ye, cannot, bear, them, now, so, here, is, a, teleological, suspension, of, the, ethical, rule, of, telling, the, whole, truth, sartre, objected, to, the, existence, of, god, if, existence, precedes, essence, it, follows, from, the, meaning, of, the, term, sentient, that, a, sentient, being, cannot, be, complete, or, perfect, in, being, and, nothingness, sartre, s, phrasing, is, that, god, would, be, a, pour, soi, a, being, for, itself, a, consciousness, who, is, also, an, en, soi, a, being, in, itself, a, thing, which, is, a, contradiction, in, terms, critics, of, sartre, rebutted, this, objection, by, stating, that, it, rests, on, a, false, dichotomy, and, a, misunderstanding, of, the, traditional, christian, view, of, god, kierkegaard, has, judge, vilhelm, express, the, christian, hope, this, way, in, either, or, either, the, first, contains, promise, for, the, future, is, the, forward, thrust, the, endless, impulse, or, the, first, does, not, impel, the, individual, the, power, which, is, in, the, first, does, not, become, the, impelling, power, but, the, repelling, power, it, becomes, that, which, thrusts, away, thus, for, the, sake, of, making, a, little, philosophical, flourish, not, with, the, pen, but, with, thought, god, only, once, became, flesh, and, it, would, be, vain, to, expect, this, to, be, repeated, sartre, agreed, with, kierkegaard, s, analysis, of, abraham, undergoing, anxiety, sartre, calls, it, anguish, but, claimed, that, god, told, abraham, to, do, it, in, his, lecture, existentialism, is, a, humanism, sartre, wondered, whether, abraham, ought, to, have, doubted, whether, god, actually, spoke, to, him, in, kierkegaard, s, view, abraham, s, certainty, had, its, origin, in, that, inner, voice, which, cannot, be, demonstrated, or, shown, to, another, the, problem, comes, as, soon, as, abraham, wants, to, be, understood, to, kierkegaard, every, external, proof, or, justification, is, merely, on, the, outside, and, external, to, the, subject, kierkegaard, s, proof, for, the, immortality, of, the, soul, for, example, is, rooted, in, the, extent, to, which, one, wishes, to, live, forever, faith, was, something, that, kierkegaard, often, wrestled, with, throughout, his, writing, career, under, both, his, real, name, and, behind, pseudonyms, he, explored, many, different, aspects, of, faith, these, various, aspects, include, faith, as, a, spiritual, goal, the, historical, orientation, of, faith, particularly, toward, jesus, christ, faith, being, a, gift, from, god, faith, as, dependency, on, a, historical, object, faith, as, a, passion, and, faith, as, a, resolution, to, personal, despair, even, so, it, has, been, argued, that, kierkegaard, never, offers, a, full, explicit, and, systematic, account, of, what, faith, is, either, or, was, published, 20, february, 1843, it, was, mostly, written, during, kierkegaard, s, stay, in, berlin, where, he, took, notes, on, schelling, s, philosophy, of, revelation, according, to, the, routledge, companion, to, philosophy, and, religion, either, or, vol, 1, consists, of, essays, of, literary, and, music, criticism, a, set, of, romantic, like, aphorisms, a, whimsical, essay, on, how, to, avoid, boredom, a, panegyric, on, the, unhappiest, possible, human, being, a, diary, recounting, a, supposed, seduction, and, vol, ii, two, enormous, didactic, and, hortatory, ethical, letters, and, a, sermon, this, opinion, is, a, reminder, of, the, type, of, controversy, kierkegaard, tried, to, encourage, in, many, of, his, writings, both, for, readers, in, his, own, generation, and, for, subsequent, generations, as, well, kierkegaardian, scholar, paul, holmer, described, kierkegaard, s, wish, in, his, introduction, to, the, 1958, publication, of, kierkegaard, s, edifying, discourses, where, he, wrote, kierkegaard, s, constant, and, lifelong, wish, to, which, his, entire, literature, gives, expression, was, to, create, a, new, and, rich, subjectivity, in, himself, and, his, readers, unlike, any, authors, who, believe, that, all, subjectivity, is, a, hindrance, kierkegaard, contends, that, only, some, kinds, of, subjectivity, are, a, hindrance, he, sought, at, once, to, produce, subjectivity, if, it, were, lacking, to, correct, it, if, it, were, there, and, needed, correction, to, amplify, and, strengthen, it, when, it, was, weak, and, undeveloped, and, always, to, bring, subjectivity, of, every, reader, to, the, point, of, eligibility, for, christian, inwardness, and, concern, but, the, edifying, discourses, though, paralleling, the, pseudonymous, works, spoke, a, little, more, directly, albeit, without, authority, they, spoke, the, real, author, s, conviction, and, were, the, purpose, of, kierkegaard, s, lifework, whereas, all, the, rest, of, his, writing, was, designed, to, get, the, readers, out, of, their, lassitude, and, mistaken, conceptions, the, discourses, early, and, late, were, the, goal, of, the, literature, later, naomi, lebowitz, explained, them, this, way, the, edifying, discourses, are, according, to, johannes, climacus, humoristically, revoked, cup, 244, swenson, lowrie, 1968, for, unlike, sermons, they, are, not, ordained, by, authority, they, start, where, the, reader, finds, himself, in, immanent, ethical, possibilities, and, aesthetic, repetitions, and, are, themselves, vulnerable, to, the, lure, of, poetic, sirens, they, force, the, dialectical, movements, of, the, making, and, unmaking, of, the, self, before, god, to, undergo, lyrical, imitations, of, meditation, while, the, clefts, rifts, abysses, are, everywhere, to, be, seen, throughout, retrospective, analyses, kierkegaard, has, been, viewed, as, an, apolitical, philosopher, despite, this, kierkegaard, did, publish, works, of, a, political, nature, such, as, his, first, published, essay, criticizing, the, movement, for, women, s, liberation, although, kierkegaard, s, earlier, works, might, include, some, misogynist, statements, a, negative, view, of, women, is, not, found, in, his, later, works, in, these, later, works, he, expressed, that, men, and, women, are, equal, before, god, showed, great, respect, for, certain, women, and, believed, that, women, are, also, capable, of, being, faithful, he, attacked, hegelianism, via, elaborate, parody, throughout, his, works, from, either, or, to, concluding, unscientific, postscript, despite, his, objections, to, hegelianism, he, expressed, an, admiration, for, hegel, personally, and, would, even, regard, his, system, favourably, if, it, was, proposed, as, a, thought, experiment, kierkegaard, leaned, towards, conservatism, being, a, personal, friend, of, danish, king, christian, viii, whom, he, viewed, as, the, moral, superior, of, every, danish, man, woman, and, child, he, argued, against, democracy, calling, it, the, most, tyrannical, form, of, government, arguing, in, favour, of, monarchy, saying, is, it, tyranny, when, one, person, wants, to, rule, leaving, the, rest, of, us, others, out, no, but, it, is, tyranny, when, all, want, to, rule, kierkegaard, held, strong, contempt, for, the, media, describing, it, as, the, most, wretched, the, most, contemptible, of, all, tyrannies, he, was, critical, of, the, danish, public, at, the, time, labeling, them, as, the, most, dangerous, of, all, powers, and, the, most, meaningless, writing, further, in, two, ages, a, literary, review, that, if, i, were, to, imagine, this, public, as, a, person, i, most, likely, would, think, of, one, of, the, roman, emperors, an, imposing, well, fed, figure, suffering, from, boredom, and, therefore, craving, only, the, sensate, titillation, of, laughter, for, the, divine, gift, of, wit, is, not, worldly, enough, so, this, person, more, sluggish, than, he, is, evil, but, negatively, domineering, saunters, around, looking, for, variety, some, interpret, kierkegaard, s, thought, as, implying, that, in, regards, to, serving, god, sexuality, is, irrelevant, before, god, not, only, for, men, and, women, but, also, for, homosexuals, and, heterosexuals, kierkegaard, s, political, philosophy, has, been, likened, to, neoconservatism, despite, its, major, influence, on, radical, and, anti, traditional, thinkers, religious, and, secular, such, as, dietrich, bonhoeffer, and, jean, paul, sartre, it, has, also, been, likened, to, anti, establishment, thought, and, has, been, described, as, a, starting, point, for, contemporary, political, theories, many, 20th, century, philosophers, both, theistic, and, atheistic, and, theologians, drew, concepts, from, kierkegaard, including, the, notions, of, angst, despair, and, the, importance, of, the, individual, his, fame, as, a, philosopher, grew, tremendously, in, the, 1930s, in, large, part, because, the, ascendant, existentialist, movement, pointed, to, him, as, a, precursor, although, later, writers, celebrated, him, as, a, highly, significant, and, influential, thinker, in, his, own, right, since, kierkegaard, was, raised, as, a, lutheran, he, was, commemorated, as, a, teacher, in, the, calendar, of, saints, of, the, lutheran,
