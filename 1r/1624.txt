sir, james, chadwick, ch, frs, 20, october, 1891, 24, july, 1974, was, an, english, physicist, who, was, awarded, the, 1935, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, discovery, of, the, neutron, in, 1932, in, 1941, he, wrote, the, final, draft, of, the, maud, report, which, inspired, the, u, s, government, to, begin, serious, atom, bomb, research, efforts, he, was, the, head, of, the, british, team, that, worked, on, the, manhattan, project, during, world, war, ii, he, was, knighted, in, britain, in, 1945, for, his, achievements, in, physics, chadwick, graduated, from, the, victoria, university, of, manchester, in, 1911, where, he, studied, under, ernest, rutherford, known, as, the, father, of, nuclear, physics, at, manchester, he, continued, to, study, under, rutherford, until, he, was, awarded, his, msc, in, 1913, the, same, year, chadwick, was, awarded, an, 1851, research, fellowship, from, the, royal, commission, for, the, exhibition, of, 1851, he, elected, to, study, beta, radiation, under, hans, geiger, in, berlin, using, geiger, s, recently, developed, geiger, counter, chadwick, was, able, to, demonstrate, that, beta, radiation, produced, a, continuous, spectrum, and, not, discrete, lines, as, had, been, thought, still, in, germany, when, world, war, i, broke, out, in, europe, he, spent, the, next, four, years, in, the, ruhleben, internment, camp, after, the, war, chadwick, followed, rutherford, to, the, cavendish, laboratory, at, the, university, of, cambridge, where, chadwick, earned, his, doctor, of, philosophy, degree, under, rutherford, s, supervision, from, gonville, and, caius, college, cambridge, in, june, 1921, he, was, rutherford, s, assistant, director, of, research, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, for, over, a, decade, at, a, time, when, it, was, one, of, the, world, s, foremost, centres, for, the, study, of, physics, attracting, students, like, john, cockcroft, norman, feather, and, mark, oliphant, chadwick, followed, his, discovery, of, the, neutron, by, measuring, its, mass, he, anticipated, that, neutrons, would, become, a, major, weapon, in, the, fight, against, cancer, chadwick, left, the, cavendish, laboratory, in, 1935, to, become, a, professor, of, physics, at, the, university, of, liverpool, where, he, overhauled, an, antiquated, laboratory, and, by, installing, a, cyclotron, made, it, an, important, centre, for, the, study, of, nuclear, physics, during, the, second, world, war, chadwick, carried, out, research, as, part, of, the, tube, alloys, project, to, build, an, atom, bomb, while, his, manchester, lab, and, environs, were, harassed, by, luftwaffe, bombing, when, the, quebec, agreement, merged, his, project, with, the, american, manhattan, project, he, became, part, of, the, british, mission, and, worked, at, the, los, alamos, laboratory, and, in, washington, d, c, he, surprised, everyone, by, earning, the, almost, complete, trust, of, project, director, leslie, r, groves, jr, for, his, efforts, chadwick, received, a, knighthood, in, the, new, year, honours, on, 1, january, 1945, in, july, 1945, he, viewed, the, trinity, nuclear, test, after, this, he, served, as, the, british, scientific, advisor, to, the, united, nations, atomic, energy, commission, uncomfortable, with, the, trend, toward, big, science, he, became, the, master, of, gonville, and, caius, college, in, 1948, he, retired, in, 1959, james, chadwick, was, born, in, bollington, cheshire, on, 20, october, 1891, the, first, child, of, john, joseph, chadwick, a, cotton, spinner, and, anne, mary, knowles, a, domestic, servant, he, was, named, james, after, his, paternal, grandfather, in, 1895, his, parents, moved, to, manchester, leaving, him, in, the, care, of, his, maternal, grandparents, he, went, to, bollington, cross, primary, school, and, was, offered, a, scholarship, to, manchester, grammar, school, which, his, family, had, to, turn, down, as, they, could, not, afford, the, small, fees, that, still, had, to, be, paid, instead, he, attended, the, central, grammar, school, for, boys, in, manchester, rejoining, his, parents, there, he, now, had, two, younger, brothers, harry, and, hubert, a, sister, had, died, in, infancy, at, the, age, of, 16, he, sat, two, examinations, for, university, scholarships, and, won, both, of, them, chadwick, chose, to, attend, victoria, university, of, manchester, which, he, entered, in, 1908, he, meant, to, study, mathematics, but, enrolled, in, physics, by, mistake, like, most, students, he, lived, at, home, walking, the, 4, miles, 6, 4, km, to, the, university, and, back, each, day, at, the, end, of, his, first, year, he, was, awarded, a, heginbottom, scholarship, to, study, physics, the, physics, department, was, headed, by, ernest, rutherford, who, assigned, research, projects, to, final, year, students, and, he, instructed, chadwick, to, devise, a, means, of, comparing, the, amount, of, radioactive, energy, of, two, different, sources, the, idea, was, that, they, could, be, measured, in, terms, of, the, activity, of, 1, gram, 0, 035, oz, of, radium, a, unit, of, measurement, which, would, become, known, as, the, curie, rutherford, s, suggested, approach, was, unworkable, something, chadwick, knew, but, was, afraid, to, tell, rutherford, so, chadwick, pressed, on, and, eventually, devised, the, required, method, the, results, became, chadwick, s, first, paper, which, co, authored, with, rutherford, was, published, in, 1912, he, graduated, with, first, class, honours, in, 1911, having, devised, a, means, of, measuring, gamma, radiation, chadwick, proceeded, to, measure, the, absorption, of, gamma, rays, by, various, gases, and, liquids, this, time, the, resulting, paper, was, published, under, his, name, alone, he, was, awarded, his, master, of, science, msc, degree, in, 1912, and, was, appointed, a, beyer, fellow, the, following, year, he, was, awarded, an, 1851, exhibition, scholarship, which, allowed, him, to, study, and, research, at, a, university, in, continental, europe, he, elected, to, go, to, the, physikalisch, technische, reichsanstalt, in, berlin, in, 1913, to, study, beta, radiation, under, hans, geiger, using, geiger, s, recently, developed, geiger, counter, which, provided, more, accuracy, than, the, earlier, photographic, techniques, he, was, able, to, demonstrate, that, beta, radiation, did, not, produce, discrete, lines, as, has, been, previously, thought, but, rather, a, continuous, spectrum, with, peaks, in, certain, regions, on, a, visit, to, geiger, s, laboratory, albert, einstein, told, chadwick, that, i, can, explain, either, of, these, things, but, i, can, t, explain, them, both, at, the, same, time, the, continuous, spectrum, would, remain, an, unexplained, phenomenon, for, many, years, chadwick, was, still, in, germany, at, the, start, of, the, first, world, war, and, was, interned, in, the, ruhleben, internment, camp, near, berlin, where, he, was, allowed, to, set, up, a, laboratory, in, the, stables, and, conduct, scientific, experiments, using, improvised, materials, such, as, radioactive, toothpaste, with, the, help, of, charles, drummond, ellis, he, worked, on, the, ionisation, of, phosphorus, and, the, photochemical, reaction, of, carbon, monoxide, and, chlorine, he, was, released, after, the, armistice, with, germany, came, into, effect, in, november, 1918, and, returned, to, his, parents, home, in, manchester, where, he, wrote, up, his, findings, over, the, previous, four, years, for, the, 1851, exhibition, commissioners, rutherford, gave, chadwick, a, part, time, teaching, position, at, manchester, allowing, him, to, continue, research, he, looked, at, the, nuclear, charge, of, platinum, silver, and, copper, and, experimentally, found, that, this, was, the, same, as, the, atomic, number, within, an, error, of, less, than, 1, 5, per, cent, in, april, 1919, rutherford, became, director, of, the, cavendish, laboratory, at, the, university, of, cambridge, and, chadwick, joined, him, there, a, few, months, later, chadwick, was, awarded, a, clerk, maxwell, studentship, in, 1920, and, enrolled, as, a, doctor, of, philosophy, phd, student, at, gonville, and, caius, college, cambridge, the, first, half, of, his, thesis, was, his, work, with, atomic, numbers, in, the, second, he, looked, at, the, forces, inside, the, nucleus, his, degree, was, awarded, in, june, 1921, in, november, he, became, a, fellow, of, gonville, and, caius, college, chadwick, s, clerk, maxwell, studentship, expired, in, 1923, and, he, was, succeeded, by, the, russian, physicist, pyotr, kapitza, the, chairman, of, the, advisory, council, of, the, department, of, scientific, and, industrial, research, sir, william, mccormick, arranged, for, chadwick, to, become, rutherford, s, assistant, director, of, research, in, this, role, chadwick, helped, rutherford, select, phd, students, over, the, next, few, years, these, would, include, john, cockcroft, norman, feather, and, mark, oliphant, who, would, become, firm, friends, with, chadwick, as, many, students, had, no, idea, what, they, wanted, to, research, rutherford, and, chadwick, would, suggest, topics, chadwick, edited, all, the, papers, produced, by, the, laboratory, in, 1925, chadwick, met, aileen, stewart, brown, the, daughter, of, a, liverpool, stockbroker, the, two, were, married, in, august, 1925, with, kapitza, as, best, man, the, couple, had, twin, daughters, joanna, and, judith, who, were, born, in, february, 1927, in, his, research, chadwick, continued, to, probe, the, nucleus, in, 1925, the, concept, of, spin, had, allowed, physicists, to, explain, the, zeeman, effect, but, it, also, created, unexplained, anomalies, at, the, time, it, was, believed, that, the, nucleus, consisted, of, protons, and, electrons, so, nitrogen, s, nucleus, for, example, with, a, mass, number, of, 14, was, assumed, to, contain, 14, protons, and, 7, electrons, this, gave, it, the, right, mass, and, charge, but, the, wrong, spin, at, a, conference, at, cambridge, on, beta, particles, and, gamma, rays, in, 1928, chadwick, met, geiger, again, geiger, had, brought, with, him, a, new, model, of, his, geiger, counter, which, had, been, improved, by, his, post, doctoral, student, walther, m, ller, chadwick, had, not, used, one, since, the, war, and, the, new, geiger, m, ller, counter, was, potentially, a, major, improvement, over, the, scintillation, techniques, then, in, use, at, cambridge, which, relied, on, the, human, eye, for, observation, the, major, drawback, with, it, was, that, it, detected, alpha, beta, and, gamma, radiation, and, radium, which, the, cavendish, laboratory, normally, used, in, its, experiments, emitted, all, three, and, was, therefore, unsuitable, for, what, chadwick, had, in, mind, however, polonium, is, an, alpha, emitter, and, lise, meitner, sent, chadwick, about, 2, millicuries, about, 0, 5, g, from, germany, in, germany, walther, bothe, and, his, student, herbert, becker, had, used, polonium, to, bombard, beryllium, with, alpha, particles, producing, an, unusual, form, of, radiation, chadwick, had, his, australian, 1851, exhibition, scholar, hugh, webster, duplicate, their, results, to, chadwick, this, was, evidence, of, something, that, he, and, rutherford, had, been, hypothesising, for, years, the, neutron, a, theoretical, nuclear, particle, with, no, electric, charge, then, in, january, 1932, feather, drew, chadwick, s, attention, to, another, surprising, result, fr, d, ric, and, ir, ne, joliot, curie, had, succeeded, in, knocking, protons, from, paraffin, wax, using, polonium, and, beryllium, as, a, source, for, what, they, thought, was, gamma, radiation, rutherford, and, chadwick, disagreed, protons, were, too, heavy, for, that, but, neutrons, would, need, only, a, small, amount, of, energy, to, achieve, the, same, effect, in, rome, ettore, majorana, came, to, the, same, conclusion, the, joliot, curies, had, discovered, the, neutron, but, did, not, know, it, chadwick, dropped, all, his, other, responsibilities, to, concentrate, on, proving, the, existence, of, the, neutron, assisted, by, feather, and, frequently, working, late, at, night, he, devised, a, simple, apparatus, that, consisted, of, a, cylinder, containing, a, polonium, source, and, beryllium, target, the, resulting, radiation, could, then, be, directed, at, a, material, such, as, paraffin, wax, the, displaced, particles, which, were, protons, would, go, into, a, small, ionisation, chamber, where, they, could, be, detected, with, an, oscilloscope, in, february, 1932, after, only, about, two, weeks, of, experimentation, with, neutrons, chadwick, sent, a, letter, to, nature, titled, possible, existence, of, a, neutron, he, communicated, his, findings, in, detail, in, an, article, sent, to, proceedings, of, the, royal, society, a, titled, the, existence, of, a, neutron, in, may, his, discovery, of, the, neutron, was, a, milestone, in, understanding, the, nucleus, reading, chadwick, s, paper, robert, bacher, and, edward, condon, realised, that, anomalies, in, the, then, current, theory, like, the, spin, of, nitrogen, would, be, resolved, if, the, neutron, has, a, spin, of, 1, 2, and, that, a, nitrogen, nucleus, consisted, of, seven, protons, and, seven, neutrons, the, theoretical, physicists, niels, bohr, and, werner, heisenberg, considered, whether, the, neutron, could, be, a, fundamental, nuclear, particle, like, the, proton, and, electron, rather, than, a, proton, electron, pair, heisenberg, showed, that, the, neutron, was, best, described, as, a, new, nuclear, particle, but, its, exact, nature, remained, unclear, in, his, 1933, bakerian, lecture, chadwick, estimated, that, a, neutron, had, a, mass, of, about, 1, 0067, u, since, a, proton, and, an, electron, had, a, combined, mass, of, 1, 0078, u, this, implied, the, neutron, as, a, proton, electron, composite, had, a, binding, energy, of, about, 2, mev, which, sounded, reasonable, although, it, was, hard, to, understand, how, a, particle, with, so, little, binding, energy, could, be, stable, estimating, such, a, small, mass, difference, required, challenging, precise, measurements, however, and, several, conflicting, results, were, obtained, in, 1933, 4, by, bombarding, boron, with, alpha, particles, fr, d, ric, and, ir, ne, joliot, curie, obtained, a, large, value, for, the, mass, of, a, neutron, but, ernest, lawrence, s, team, at, the, university, of, california, produced, a, small, one, then, maurice, goldhaber, a, refugee, from, nazi, germany, and, a, graduate, student, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, suggested, to, chadwick, that, deuterons, could, be, photodisintegrated, by, the, 2, 6, mev, gamma, rays, of, 208, tl, then, known, as, thorium, c, an, accurate, value, for, the, mass, of, the, neutron, could, be, determined, from, this, process, chadwick, and, goldhaber, tried, this, and, found, that, it, worked, they, measured, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, proton, produced, as, 1, 05, mev, leaving, the, mass, of, the, neutron, as, the, unknown, in, the, equation, chadwick, and, goldhaber, calculated, that, it, was, either, 1, 0084, or, 1, 0090, atomic, units, depending, on, the, values, used, for, the, masses, of, the, proton, and, deuteron, the, modern, accepted, value, for, the, mass, of, the, neutron, is, 1, 008, 66, u, the, mass, of, the, neutron, was, too, large, to, be, a, proton, electron, pair, for, his, discovery, of, the, neutron, chadwick, was, awarded, the, hughes, medal, by, the, royal, society, in, 1932, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1935, the, copley, medal, in, 1950, and, the, franklin, medal, in, 1951, his, discovery, of, the, neutron, made, it, possible, to, produce, elements, heavier, than, uranium, in, the, laboratory, by, the, capture, of, slow, neutrons, followed, by, beta, decay, unlike, the, positively, charged, alpha, particles, which, are, repelled, by, the, electrical, forces, present, in, the, nuclei, of, other, atoms, neutrons, do, not, need, to, overcome, any, coulomb, barrier, and, can, therefore, penetrate, and, enter, the, nuclei, of, even, the, heaviest, elements, such, as, uranium, this, inspired, enrico, fermi, to, investigate, the, nuclear, reactions, brought, about, by, collisions, of, nuclei, with, slow, neutrons, work, for, which, fermi, would, receive, the, nobel, prize, in, 1938, wolfgang, pauli, proposed, another, kind, of, particle, on, 4, december, 1930, to, explain, the, continuous, spectrum, of, beta, radiation, that, chadwick, had, reported, in, 1914, since, not, all, of, the, energy, of, beta, radiation, could, be, accounted, for, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, appeared, to, be, violated, but, pauli, argued, that, this, could, be, redressed, if, another, undiscovered, particle, was, involved, pauli, also, called, this, particle, a, neutron, but, it, was, clearly, not, the, same, particle, as, chadwick, s, neutron, fermi, renamed, it, the, neutrino, italian, for, little, neutron, in, 1934, fermi, proposed, his, theory, of, beta, decay, which, explained, that, the, electrons, emitted, from, the, nucleus, were, created, by, the, decay, of, a, neutron, into, a, proton, an, electron, and, a, neutrino, the, neutrino, could, account, for, the, missing, energy, but, a, particle, with, little, mass, and, no, electric, charge, was, difficult, to, observe, rudolf, peierls, and, hans, bethe, calculated, that, neutrinos, could, easily, pass, through, the, earth, so, the, chances, of, detecting, them, were, slim, frederick, reines, and, clyde, cowan, would, confirm, the, neutrino, on, 14, june, 1956, by, placing, a, detector, within, a, large, antineutrino, flux, from, a, nearby, nuclear, reactor, with, the, onset, of, the, great, depression, in, the, united, kingdom, the, government, became, more, parsimonious, with, funding, for, science, at, the, same, time, lawrence, s, recent, invention, the, cyclotron, promised, to, revolutionise, experimental, nuclear, physics, and, chadwick, felt, that, the, cavendish, laboratory, would, fall, behind, unless, it, also, acquired, one, he, therefore, chafed, under, rutherford, who, clung, to, the, belief, that, good, nuclear, physics, could, still, be, done, without, large, expensive, equipment, and, turned, down, the, request, for, a, cyclotron, chadwick, was, himself, a, critic, of, big, science, in, general, and, lawrence, in, particular, whose, approach, he, considered, careless, and, focused, on, technology, at, the, expense, of, science, when, lawrence, postulated, the, existence, of, a, new, and, hitherto, unknown, particle, that, he, claimed, was, a, possible, source, of, limitless, energy, at, the, solvay, conference, in, 1933, chadwick, responded, that, the, results, were, more, likely, attributable, to, contamination, of, the, equipment, while, lawrence, rechecked, his, results, at, berkeley, only, to, find, that, chadwick, was, correct, rutherford, and, oliphant, conducted, an, investigation, at, the, cavendish, that, found, that, deuterium, fuses, to, form, helium, 3, thereby, causing, the, effect, that, lawrence, had, observed, this, was, another, major, discovery, but, the, oliphant, rutherford, particle, accelerator, was, an, expensive, state, of, the, art, piece, of, equipment, in, march, 1935, chadwick, received, an, offer, of, the, lyon, jones, chair, of, physics, at, the, university, of, liverpool, in, his, wife, s, home, town, to, succeed, lionel, wilberforce, the, laboratory, was, so, antiquated, that, it, still, ran, on, direct, current, electricity, but, chadwick, seized, the, opportunity, assuming, the, chair, on, 1, october, 1935, the, university, s, prestige, was, soon, bolstered, by, chadwick, s, nobel, prize, which, was, announced, in, november, 1935, his, medal, was, sold, at, auction, in, 2014, for, 329, 000, chadwick, set, about, acquiring, a, cyclotron, for, liverpool, he, started, by, spending, 700, to, refurbish, the, antiquated, laboratories, at, liverpool, so, some, components, could, be, made, in, house, he, was, able, to, persuade, the, university, to, provide, 2, 000, and, obtained, a, grant, for, another, 2, 000, from, the, royal, society, to, build, his, cyclotron, chadwick, brought, in, two, young, experts, bernard, kinsey, and, harold, walke, who, had, worked, with, lawrence, at, the, university, of, california, a, local, cable, manufacturer, donated, the, copper, conductor, for, the, coils, the, cyclotron, s, 50, ton, magnet, was, manufactured, in, trafford, park, by, metropolitan, vickers, which, also, made, the, vacuum, chamber, the, cyclotron, was, completely, installed, and, running, in, july, 1939, the, total, cost, of, 5, 184, was, more, than, chadwick, had, received, from, the, university, and, the, royal, society, so, chadwick, paid, the, rest, from, his, 159, 917, kr, 8, 243, nobel, prize, money, at, liverpool, the, medicine, and, science, faculties, worked, together, closely, chadwick, was, automatically, a, committee, member, of, both, faculties, and, in, 1938, he, was, appointed, to, a, commission, headed, by, lord, derby, to, investigate, the, arrangements, for, cancer, treatment, in, liverpool, chadwick, anticipated, that, neutrons, and, radioactive, isotopes, produced, with, the, 37, inch, cyclotron, could, be, used, to, study, biochemical, processes, and, might, become, a, weapon, in, the, fight, against, cancer, in, germany, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, bombarded, uranium, with, neutrons, and, noted, that, barium, a, lighter, element, was, among, the, products, produced, hitherto, only, the, same, or, heavier, elements, had, been, produced, by, the, process, in, january, 1939, meitner, and, her, nephew, otto, frisch, astounded, the, physics, community, with, a, paper, that, explained, this, result, they, theorised, that, uranium, atoms, bombarded, with, neutrons, can, break, into, two, roughly, equal, fragments, a, process, they, called, fission, they, calculated, that, this, would, result, in, the, release, of, about, 200, mev, implying, an, energy, release, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, chemical, reactions, and, frisch, confirmed, their, theory, experimentally, it, was, soon, noted, by, hahn, that, if, neutrons, were, released, during, fission, then, a, chain, reaction, was, possible, french, scientists, pierre, joliot, hans, von, halban, and, lew, kowarski, soon, verified, that, more, than, one, neutron, was, indeed, emitted, per, fission, in, a, paper, co, authored, with, the, american, physicist, john, wheeler, bohr, theorised, that, fission, was, more, likely, to, occur, in, the, uranium, 235, isotope, which, made, up, only, 0, 7, per, cent, of, natural, uranium, chadwick, did, not, believe, that, there, was, any, likelihood, of, another, war, with, germany, in, 1939, and, took, his, family, for, a, holiday, on, a, remote, lake, in, northern, sweden, the, news, of, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, therefore, came, as, a, shock, determined, not, to, spend, another, war, in, an, internment, camp, chadwick, made, his, way, to, stockholm, as, fast, as, he, could, but, when, he, arrived, there, with, his, family, he, found, that, all, air, traffic, between, stockholm, and, london, had, been, suspended, they, made, their, way, back, to, england, on, a, tramp, steamer, when, he, reached, liverpool, chadwick, found, joseph, rotblat, a, polish, post, doctoral, fellow, who, had, come, to, work, with, the, cyclotron, was, now, destitute, as, he, was, cut, off, from, funds, from, poland, chadwick, promptly, hired, rotblat, as, a, lecturer, despite, his, poor, grasp, of, english, in, october, 1939, chadwick, received, a, letter, from, sir, edward, appleton, the, secretary, of, the, department, of, scientific, and, industrial, research, asking, for, his, opinion, on, the, feasibility, of, an, atom, bomb, chadwick, responded, cautiously, he, did, not, dismiss, the, possibility, but, carefully, went, over, the, many, theoretical, and, practical, difficulties, involved, chadwick, decided, to, investigate, the, properties, of, uranium, oxide, further, with, rotblat, in, march, 1940, otto, frisch, and, rudolf, peierls, at, the, university, of, birmingham, re, examined, the, theoretical, issues, involved, in, a, paper, that, became, known, as, the, frisch, peierls, memorandum, instead, of, looking, at, unenriched, uranium, oxide, they, considered, what, would, happen, to, a, sphere, of, pure, uranium, 235, and, found, that, not, only, could, a, chain, reaction, occur, but, that, it, might, require, as, little, as, 1, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, of, uranium, 235, and, unleash, the, energy, of, tons, of, dynamite, a, special, subcommittee, of, the, committee, for, the, scientific, survey, of, air, warfare, cssaw, known, as, the, maud, committee, was, created, to, investigate, the, matter, further, it, was, chaired, by, sir, george, thomson, and, its, original, membership, included, chadwick, along, with, mark, oliphant, john, cockcroft, and, philip, moon, while, other, teams, investigated, uranium, enrichment, techniques, chadwick, s, team, at, liverpool, concentrated, on, determining, the, nuclear, cross, section, of, uranium, 235, by, april, 1941, it, had, been, experimentally, confirmed, that, the, critical, mass, of, uranium, 235, might, be, 8, kilograms, 18, lb, or, less, his, research, into, such, matters, was, complicated, by, all, but, incessant, luftwaffe, bombings, of, the, environs, of, his, liverpool, lab, the, windows, were, blown, out, so, often, that, they, were, replaced, by, cardboard, in, july, 1941, chadwick, was, chosen, to, write, the, final, draft, of, the, maud, report, which, when, presented, by, vannevar, bush, to, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, in, october, 1941, inspired, the, u, s, government, to, pour, millions, of, dollars, into, the, pursuit, of, an, atom, bomb, when, george, b, pegram, and, harold, urey, visited, britain, to, see, how, the, project, now, known, as, tube, alloys, was, going, chadwick, was, able, to, tell, them, i, wish, i, could, tell, you, that, the, bomb, is, not, going, to, work, but, i, am, 90, per, cent, sure, that, it, will, in, a, recent, book, about, the, bomb, project, graham, farmelo, wrote, that, chadwick, did, more, than, any, other, scientist, to, give, churchill, the, bomb, chadwick, was, tested, almost, to, the, breaking, point, so, worried, that, he, could, not, sleep, chadwick, resorted, to, sleeping, pills, which, he, continued, to, take, for, most, of, his, remaining, years, chadwick, later, said, that, he, realised, that, a, nuclear, bomb, was, not, only, possible, it, was, inevitable, sooner, or, later, these, ideas, could, not, be, peculiar, to, us, everybody, would, think, about, them, before, long, and, some, country, would, put, them, into, action, sir, hermann, bondi, suggested, that, it, was, fortunate, that, chadwick, not, rutherford, was, the, doyen, of, uk, physics, at, the, time, as, the, latter, s, prestige, might, otherwise, have, overpowered, chadwick, s, interest, in, looking, forward, to, the, bomb, s, prospects, owing, to, the, danger, from, aerial, bombardment, the, chadwicks, sent, their, twins, to, canada, as, part, of, a, government, evacuation, scheme, chadwick, was, reluctant, to, move, tube, alloys, there, believing, that, the, united, kingdom, was, a, better, location, for, the, isotope, separation, plant, the, enormous, scope, of, the, effort, became, more, apparent, in, 1942, even, a, pilot, separation, plant, would, cost, over, 1, million, and, strain, britain, s, resources, to, say, nothing, of, a, full, scale, plant, which, was, estimated, to, cost, somewhere, in, the, vicinity, of, 25, million, it, would, have, to, be, built, in, america, at, the, same, time, that, the, british, became, convinced, that, a, joint, project, was, necessary, the, progress, of, the, american, manhattan, project, was, such, that, british, cooperation, seemed, less, essential, although, the, americans, were, still, eager, to, use, chadwick, s, talents, the, matter, of, cooperation, had, to, be, taken, up, at, the, highest, level, in, september, 1943, the, prime, minister, winston, churchill, and, president, roosevelt, negotiated, the, quebec, agreement, which, reinstated, cooperation, between, britain, the, united, states, and, canada, chadwick, oliphant, peierls, and, simon, were, summoned, to, the, united, states, by, the, director, of, tube, alloys, sir, wallace, akers, to, work, with, the, manhattan, project, the, quebec, agreement, established, a, new, combined, policy, committee, to, direct, the, joint, project, the, americans, disliked, akers, so, chadwick, was, appointed, technical, advisor, to, the, combined, policy, committee, and, the, head, of, the, british, mission, leaving, rotblat, in, charge, in, liverpool, chadwick, began, a, tour, of, the, manhattan, project, facilities, in, november, 1943, except, for, the, hanford, site, where, plutonium, was, produced, which, he, was, not, allowed, to, see, he, became, the, only, man, apart, from, groves, and, his, second, in, command, to, have, access, to, all, the, american, research, and, production, facilities, for, the, uranium, bomb, observing, the, work, on, the, k, 25, gaseous, diffusion, facility, at, oak, ridge, tennessee, chadwick, realised, how, wrong, he, had, been, about, building, the, plant, in, wartime, britain, the, enormous, structure, could, never, have, been, concealed, from, the, luftwaffe, in, early, 1944, he, moved, to, los, alamos, new, mexico, with, his, wife, and, their, twins, who, now, spoke, with, canadian, accents, for, security, reasons, he, was, given, the, cover, name, of, james, chaffee, chadwick, accepted, that, the, americans, did, not, need, british, help, but, that, it, could, still, be, useful, in, bringing, the, project, to, an, early, and, successful, conclusion, working, closely, with, the, director, of, the, manhattan, project, major, general, leslie, r, groves, jr, he, attempted, to, do, everything, he, could, to, support, the, effort, he, also, endeavoured, to, place, british, scientists, in, as, many, parts, of, the, project, as, possible, to, facilitate, a, post, war, british, nuclear, weapons, project, to, which, chadwick, was, committed, requests, from, groves, via, chadwick, for, particular, scientists, tended, to, be, met, with, an, immediate, rejection, by, the, company, ministry, or, university, currently, employing, them, only, to, be, overcome, by, the, overriding, priority, accorded, to, tube, alloys, as, a, result, the, british, team, was, critical, to, the, project, s, success, although, he, had, more, knowledge, of, the, project, than, anyone, else, from, britain, chadwick, had, no, access, to, the, hanford, site, lord, portal, was, offered, a, tour, of, hanford, in, 1946, this, was, the, only, plant, to, which, chadwick, had, been, denied, access, in, wartime, and, now, he, asked, groves, if, he, could, accompany, portal, groves, replied, that, he, could, but, if, he, did, then, portal, will, not, see, very, much, for, his, efforts, chadwick, received, a, knighthood, in, the, new, year, honours, on, 1, january, 1945, he, considered, this, to, be, a, recognition, of, the, work, of, the, whole, tube, alloys, project, by, early, 1945, chadwick, was, spending, most, of, his, time, in, washington, d, c, and, his, family, relocated, from, los, alamos, to, a, house, on, washington, s, dupont, circle, in, april, 1945, he, was, present, at, the, meeting, of, the, combined, policy, committee, on, 4, july, when, field, marshal, sir, henry, maitland, wilson, gave, britain, s, agreement, to, use, the, atom, bomb, against, japan, and, at, the, trinity, nuclear, test, on, 16, july, when, the, first, atom, bomb, was, detonated, inside, its, pit, was, a, polonium, beryllium, modulated, neutron, initiator, a, development, of, the, technique, that, chadwick, had, used, to, discover, the, neutron, over, a, decade, before, william, l, laurence, the, new, york, times, reporter, attached, to, the, manhattan, project, wrote, that, never, before, in, history, had, any, man, lived, to, see, his, own, discovery, materialize, itself, with, such, telling, effect, on, the, destiny, of, man, shortly, after, the, war, ended, chadwick, was, appointed, to, the, advisory, committee, on, atomic, energy, acae, he, was, also, appointed, as, the, british, scientific, advisor, to, the, united, nations, atomic, energy, commission, he, clashed, with, fellow, acae, member, patrick, blackett, who, disagreed, with, chadwick, s, conviction, that, britain, needed, to, acquire, its, own, nuclear, weapons, but, it, was, chadwick, s, position, that, was, ultimately, adopted, he, returned, to, britain, in, 1946, to, find, a, country, still, beset, by, wartime, rationing, and, shortages, at, this, time, sir, james, mountford, the, vice, chancellor, of, the, university, of, liverpool, wrote, in, his, diary, he, had, never, seen, a, man, so, physically, mentally, and, spiritually, tired, as, chadwick, for, he, had, plumbed, such, depths, of, moral, decision, as, more, fortunate, men, are, never, called, upon, even, to, peer, into, almost, insupportable, agonies, of, responsibility, arising, from, his, scientific, work, in, 1948, chadwick, accepted, an, offer, to, become, the, master, of, gonville, and, caius, college, the, job, was, prestigious, but, ill, defined, the, master, was, the, titular, head, of, the, college, but, authority, actually, resided, in, a, council, of, 13, fellows, of, whom, one, was, the, master, as, master, chadwick, strove, to, improve, the, academic, reputation, of, the, college, he, increased, the, number, of, research, fellowships, from, 31, to, 49, and, sought, to, bring, talent, into, the, college, this, involved, controversial, decisions, such, as, hiring, in, 1951, the, chinese, biochemist, tien, chin, tsao, and, the, hungarian, born, economist, peter, bauer, in, what, became, known, as, the, peasants, revolt, fellows, led, by, patrick, hadley, voted, an, old, friend, of, chadwick, s, off, the, council, and, replaced, him, with, bauer, more, friends, of, chadwick, s, were, removed, over, the, following, years, and, he, retired, in, november, 1958, it, was, during, his, mastership, that, francis, crick, a, phd, student, at, gonville, and, caius, college, and, james, watson, discovered, the, structure, of, dna, by, the, 1970s, chadwick, became, more, frail, and, seldom, left, his, flat, although, he, travelled, to, liverpool, for, celebrations, of, his, eightieth, birthday, a, lifelong, atheist, he, saw, no, reason, to, adopt, religious, faith, in, later, life, he, died, in, his, sleep, on, 24, july, 1974
