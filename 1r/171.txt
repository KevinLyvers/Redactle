awaited, museums, designed, by, gehry, opened, the, biomuseo, a, biodiversity, museum, in, panama, city, panama, and, the, fondation, louis, vuitton, a, modern, art, museum, in, the, bois, de, boulogne, park, in, paris, france, which, opened, to, some, rave, reviews, also, in, 2014, gehry, was, commissioned, by, river, la, formerly, the, los, angeles, river, revitalization, corporation, a,

million, building, for, the, university, of, technology, sydney, was, officially, opened, whose, fa, ade, has, more, than, 320, 000, hand, placed, bricks, and, glass, slabs, gehry, said, he, would, not, design, a, building, like, the, crumpled, paper, bag, again, gehry, told, the, french, newspaper, la, croix, in, november, 2016, that, president, of, france, fran, ois, hollande, had, assured, him, he, could, relocate, to, france, if, donald, trump, was, elected, president, of, the, united, states, the, following, month, gehry, said, that, he, had, no, plans, to, move, trump, and, he, exchanged, words, in, 2010, when, gehry, s, 8, spruce, street, originally, known, as, beekman, tower, was, built, 1, foot, 0, 30, m, taller, than, the, nearby, trump, building, which, until, then, was, new, york, city, s, tallest, residential, building, notable, gehry, designed, buildings, completed, in, the, 2020s, include, the, dwight, d, eisenhower, memorial, in, washington, dc, and, the, luma, arles, museum, in, france, in, 2021, noting, gehry, s, progress, on, an, increasing, number, of, significant, projects, in, his, hometown, including, the, grand, avenue, project, a, concert, hall, for, the, youth, orchestra, los, angeles, and, an, office, building, for, warner, bros, the, architect, s, newspaper, stated, that, seventy, four, years, after, he, moved, there, from, his, native, toronto, l, a, is, looking, more, and, more, like, gehry, country, said, to, defy, categorisation, gehry, s, work, reflects, a, spirit, of, experimentation, coupled, with, a, respect, for, the, demands, of, professional, practice, and, has, remained, largely, unaligned, with, broader, stylistic, tendencies, or, movements, with, his, earliest, educational, influences, rooted, in, modernism, gehry, s, work, has, sought, to, escape, modernist, stylistic, tropes, while, remaining, interested, in, some, of, its, underlying, transformative, agendas, continually, working, between, given, circumstances, and, unanticipated, materializations, he, has, been, assessed, as, someone, who, made, us, produce, buildings, that, are, fun, sculpturally, exciting, good, experiences, although, his, approach, may, become, less, relevant, as, pressure, mounts, to, do, more, with, less, gehry, s, style, at, times, seems, unfinished, or, even, crude, but, his, work, is, consistent, with, the, california, funk, art, movement, of, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, which, featured, the, use, of, inexpensive, found, objects, and, nontraditional, media, such, as, clay, to, make, serious, art, his, works, always, have, at, least, some, element, of, deconstructivism, he, has, been, called, the, apostle, of, chain, link, fencing, and, corrugated, metal, siding, however, a, retrospective, exhibit, at, new, york, s, whitney, museum, in, 1988, revealed, that, he, is, also, a, sophisticated, classical, artist, who, knows, european, art, history, and, contemporary, sculpture, and, painting, after, the, phenomenal, success, of, gehry, s, design, for, the, guggenheim, museum, in, bilbao, spain, critics, began, referring, to, the, economic, and, cultural, revitalization, of, cities, through, iconic, innovative, architecture, as, the, bilbao, effect, in, the, first, 12, months, after, the, museum, was, opened, an, estimated, us, 160, million, were, added, to, the, basque, economy, indeed, over, 3, 5, billion, have, been, added, to, the, basque, economy, since, the, building, opened, in, subsequent, years, there, have, been, many, attempts, to, replicate, this, effect, through, large, scale, eye, catching, architectural, commissions, that, have, been, both, successful, and, unsuccessful, such, as, daniel, libeskind, s, expansion, of, the, denver, art, museum, and, buildings, by, gehry, himself, such, as, the, almost, universally, well, received, walt, disney, concert, hall, in, los, angeles, and, the, more, controversial, museum, of, pop, culture, in, seattle, though, some, link, the, concept, of, the, bilbao, effect, to, the, notion, of, starchitecture, gehry, has, consistently, rejected, the, label, of, a, starchitect, though, much, of, gehry, s, work, has, been, well, received, its, reception, was, not, always, positive, art, historian, hal, foster, reads, gehry, s, architecture, as, primarily, in, the, service, of, corporate, branding, criticism, of, his, work, includes, complaints, over, design, flaws, that, the, buildings, waste, structural, resources, by, creating, functionless, forms, do, not, seem, to, belong, in, their, surroundings, or, enhance, the, public, context, of, their, locations, and, are, apparently, designed, without, taking, into, account, the, local, climate, moreover, socialist, magazine, jacobin, pointed, out, that, gehry, s, work, can, be, summed, up, as, architecture, for, the, super, wealthy, in, the, sense, that, it, is, expensive, not, resourceful, and, does, not, serve, the, interests, of, the, overwhelming, majority, the, article, criticized, gehry, s, statement, in, the, world, we, live, in, 98, percent, of, what, gets, built, and, designed, today, is, pure, shit, in, january, 2011, gehry, joined, the, university, of, southern, california, usc, faculty, as, the, judge, widney, professor, of, architecture, he, has, since, continued, in, this, role, at, his, alma, mater, he, has, also, held, teaching, positions, at, harvard, university, the, university, of, california, at, los, angeles, the, university, of, toronto, columbia, university, the, federal, institute, of, technology, in, z, rich, and, at, yale, university, where, he, still, teaches, as, of, 2017, though, he, is, often, referred, to, as, a, starchitect, he, has, repeatedly, expressed, his, disdain, for, the, term, insisting, he, is, only, an, architect, steve, sample, president, of, the, university, of, southern, california, told, gehry, that, after, george, lucas, you, are, our, most, prominent, graduate, as, of, december, 2013, gehry, has, received, over, a, dozen, honorary, university, degrees, see, honorary, doctorates, in, february, 2017, masterclass, announced,
