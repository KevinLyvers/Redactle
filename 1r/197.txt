antonio, stradivari, s, t, r, d, v, r, i, also, us, v, r, i, italian, c, 1644, 18, december, 1737, was, an, italian, luthier, and, a, craftsman, of, string, instruments, such, as, violins, cellos, guitars, violas, and, harps, the, latinized, form, of, his, surname, stradivarius, as, well, as, the, colloquial, strad, are, terms, often, used, to, refer, to, his, instruments, it, is, estimated, that, stradivari, produced, 1, 116, instruments, of, which, 960, were, violins, around, 650, instruments, survive, including, 450, to, 512, violins, his, instruments, are, considered, some, of, the, finest, ever, made, and, are, extremely, valuable, collector, s, items, antonio, stradivari, s, birthdate, presumably, between, 1644, and, 1649, has, been, debated, amongst, historians, due, to, the, numerous, inconsistencies, in, the, evidence, of, the, latter, the, 1668, and, 1678, censuses, report, him, actually, growing, younger, a, fact, explained, by, the, probable, loss, of, statistics, from, 1647, to, 1649, when, renewed, belligerency, between, france, s, modenese, and, spain, s, milanese, proxies, led, to, a, flow, of, refugees, that, included, stradivari, s, mother, stradivari, s, ancestry, consisted, of, notable, citizens, of, cremona, dating, back, to, at, least, the, 12th, or, 13th, century, the, earliest, mention, of, the, family, name, or, a, variation, upon, it, is, in, a, land, grant, dating, from, 1188, the, origin, of, the, name, itself, has, several, possible, explanations, some, sources, say, it, is, the, plural, of, stradivare, essentially, meaning, toll, man, in, lombard, while, others, say, that, the, form, de, strataverta, derives, from, strada, averta, which, in, cremonese, dialect, means, open, road, antonio, s, parents, were, alessandro, stradivari, son, of, giulio, cesare, stradivari, and, anna, moroni, daughter, of, leonardo, moroni, they, married, on, 30, august, 1622, and, had, at, least, three, children, between, 1623, and, 1628, giuseppe, giulio, cesare, carlo, felice, and, giovanni, battista, the, baptismal, records, of, the, parish, of, s, prospero, then, stop, and, it, is, unknown, whether, they, had, any, children, from, 1628, to, 1644, this, gap, in, the, records, may, be, due, to, the, family, leaving, cremona, in, response, to, war, famine, and, plague, in, the, city, from, 1628, to, 1630, or, the, records, may, have, been, lost, due, to, clerical, reforms, imposed, by, joseph, ii, of, austria, in, 1788, the, latter, explanation, is, supported, by, the, word, cremonensis, of, cremona, on, many, of, stradivari, s, labels, which, suggests, that, he, was, born, in, the, city, instead, of, merely, moving, back, there, to, work, antonio, was, born, in, 1644, a, fact, deducible, from, later, violins, however, there, are, no, records, or, information, available, on, his, early, childhood, and, the, first, evidence, of, his, presence, in, cremona, is, the, label, of, his, oldest, surviving, violin, from, 1666, stradivari, likely, began, an, apprenticeship, with, nicola, amati, between, the, ages, of, 12, and, 14, although, a, minor, debate, surrounds, this, fact, one, of, the, few, pieces, of, evidence, supporting, this, is, the, label, of, his, 1666, violin, which, reads, alumnus, nicolai, amati, faciebat, anno, 1666, however, stradivari, did, not, repeatedly, put, amati, s, name, on, his, labels, unlike, many, of, amati, s, other, students, stradivari, s, early, violins, actually, bear, less, resemblance, to, amati, s, than, his, later, instruments, do, m, chanot, chardon, a, well, known, french, luthier, asserted, that, his, father, had, a, label, of, stradivari, s, stating, made, at, the, age, of, thirteen, in, the, workshop, of, nicol, amati, this, label, has, never, been, found, or, confirmed, amati, would, also, have, been, a, logical, choice, for, antonio, s, parents, as, he, represented, an, old, family, of, violin, makers, in, cremona, and, was, far, superior, to, most, other, luthiers, in, italy, some, researchers, believe, there, is, a, closer, educational, association, between, antonio, stradivari, and, francesco, rugeri, than, has, previously, been, recognized, despite, the, long, held, belief, that, antonio, stradivari, was, the, pupil, of, nicol, amati, there, are, important, discrepancies, between, their, work, some, researchers, believe, early, instruments, by, stradivari, bear, a, stronger, resemblance, to, francesco, rugeri, s, work, than, amati, s, additionally, the, utilization, of, a, small, dorsal, pin, or, small, hole, invariably, used, not, just, by, nicol, amati, but, all, of, his, recognized, pupils, but, not, used, by, antonio, stradivari, adds, further, evidence, that, stradivari, may, not, have, learnt, his, craft, from, amati, this, pin, or, hole, was, fundamental, in, the, graduation, of, the, thickness, of, the, plates, and, was, a, technique, passed, on, through, generations, of, pupils, of, the, amati, this, dorsal, pin, is, also, not, found, in, any, of, the, instruments, of, the, rugeri, family, suggesting, antonio, stradivari, may, have, actually, learnt, his, craft, from, francesco, rugeri, both, of, them, having, been, influenced, by, amati, w, e, hill, sons, concede, that, they, fail, to, find, the, hand, of, stradivari, in, any, of, nicola, amati, s, work, although, the, unmistakable, hands, of, andrea, guarneri, and, francesco, rugeri, are, evident, an, alternative, theory, is, that, stradivari, started, out, as, a, woodworker, the, house, he, lived, in, from, 1667, to, 1680, was, owned, by, francesco, pescaroli, a, woodcarver, and, inlayer, stradivari, may, even, have, been, employed, to, decorate, some, of, amati, s, instruments, without, being, a, true, apprentice, this, theory, is, supported, by, some, of, stradivari, s, later, violins, which, have, elaborate, decorations, and, purfling, assuming, that, stradivari, was, a, student, of, amati, he, would, have, begun, his, apprenticeship, in, 1656, 58, and, produced, his, first, decent, instruments, in, 1660, at, the, age, of, 16, his, first, labels, were, printed, from, 1660, to, 1665, which, indicates, that, his, work, had, sufficient, quality, to, be, offered, directly, to, his, patrons, however, he, probably, stayed, in, amati, s, workshop, until, about, 1684, using, his, master, s, reputation, as, a, launching, point, for, his, career, stradivari, married, his, first, wife, francesca, ferraboschi, on, 4, july, 1667, a, clue, to, how, they, would, have, met, lies, in, the, 1659, easter, census, which, lists, the, ferraboschi, family, four, houses, away, from, the, amati, residence, francesca, was, the, young, widow, of, the, burgher, giacomo, capra, with, whom, she, had, two, children, francesca, s, brother, had, shot, giacomo, with, a, crossbow, on, the, piazza, garibaldi, formerly, the, piazza, santa, agata, in, 1664, he, was, later, exiled, though, allowed, to, return, to, cremona, many, years, later, after, their, marriage, stradivari, moved, into, a, house, known, as, the, casa, del, pescatore, or, the, casa, nuziale, in, his, wife, s, parish, the, couple, had, a, daughter, giulia, maria, three, to, four, months, later, they, remained, in, the, house, until, 1680, during, which, time, they, had, five, more, children, starting, with, an, infant, son, who, lived, for, only, a, week, and, then, francesco, catterina, alessandro, and, omobono, stradivari, stradivari, purchased, a, house, now, known, as, no, 1, piazza, roma, formerly, no, 2, piazza, san, domenico, around, 1680, for, the, sum, of, 7000, lire, 2000, of, which, he, paid, at, the, time, of, the, purchase, the, totality, of, the, house, was, paid, for, by, 1684, the, residence, was, just, doors, away, from, those, of, several, other, violin, making, families, of, cremona, including, the, amatis, and, guarneris, stradivari, probably, worked, in, the, loft, and, attic, and, he, stayed, in, this, house, for, the, rest, of, his, life, stradivari, s, wife, francesca, died, on, 20, may, 1698, and, received, an, elaborate, funeral, five, days, later, stradivari, married, his, second, wife, antonia, maria, zambelli, on, 24, august, 1699, she, was, 35, at, the, time, of, the, marriage, they, had, five, children, from, 1700, to, 1708, francesca, maria, giovanni, battista, giuseppe, giovanni, battista, martino, giuseppe, antonio, and, paolo, stradivari, died, in, cremona, on, 18, december, 1737, aged, 93, after, roughly, 75, years, of, crafting, instruments, he, is, buried, in, the, church, of, san, domenico, the, tomb, was, acquired, eight, years, prior, to, his, death, having, been, bought, from, a, cremonese, family, substituting, his, name, for, theirs, in, the, tombstone, stradivari, generated, substantial, wealth, in, his, lifetime, his, will, dated, 1729, counted, eight, living, heirs, including, his, wife, zambelli, was, left, with, her, clothing, bed, linens, household, items, and, half, of, her, jewelry, antonia, would, become, the, responsibility, of, his, two, eldest, sons, annunciata, caterina, was, left, her, jewelry, clothing, linens, and, income, on, loans, paolo, the, youngest, child, would, get, six, finished, violins, valued, at, 1, 000, lire, as, well, as, some, household, effects, and, cash, three, other, children, who, had, joined, religious, orders, were, left, with, their, share, of, inheritance, maria, a, nun, would, get, an, annuity, alessandro, a, priest, would, get, fixed, income, on, a, home, mortgage, loan, and, giuseppe, another, priest, would, get, some, income, on, half, a, share, from, a, pastry, shop, there, were, also, annual, payments, to, his, two, sons, of, 150, and, 300, lire, each, and, 170, lire, for, annunciata, and, 100, for, francesca, his, remaining, two, sons, from, his, first, marriage, had, both, worked, in, the, family, shop, omobono, who, had, left, the, dwelling, aged, eighteen, in, search, of, new, employment, possibilities, in, naples, would, inherit, six, violins, and, francesco, who, was, named, his, father, s, successor, would, inherit, the, rest, of, the, estate, including, all, of, the, tools, stencils, finished, violins, patterns, and, ostensibly, his, father, s, reputation, in, 1733, he, had, bought, his, youngest, son, a, partnership, in, a, local, textile, firm, for, the, large, amount, of, 25, 000, lire, stradivari, probably, developed, his, own, style, slowly, some, of, his, early, violins, were, smaller, with, notable, exception, to, this, is, the, 1679, hellier, violin, which, had, much, larger, proportions, stradivari, s, early, pre, 1684, violins, are, in, strong, contrast, to, amati, s, instruments, from, the, same, time, period, stradivari, s, have, a, stronger, build, less, rounded, curves, with, the, purfling, set, farther, in, by, 1680, stradivari, had, acquired, at, least, a, small, yet, growing, reputation, in, 1682, a, venetian, banker, ordered, a, complete, set, of, instruments, which, he, planned, to, present, to, king, james, ii, of, england, the, fate, of, these, instruments, is, unknown, cosimo, iii, de, medici, bought, another, five, years, later, amati, died, in, 1684, an, event, followed, by, a, noticeable, increase, in, stradivari, s, production, the, years, 1684, and, 1685, also, marked, an, important, development, in, his, style, the, dimensions, he, used, generally, increased, and, his, instruments, were, more, in, the, style, of, amati, s, work, of, the, 1640s, and, 1650s, stradivari, s, instruments, underwent, no, major, change, in, the, next, five, years, although, in, 1688, he, began, cutting, a, more, distinct, bevel, and, began, outlining, the, heads, of, instruments, in, black, a, quite, original, improvement, stradivari, s, relatively, early, success, in, his, career, may, have, allowed, him, to, use, a, more, experimental, approach, to, violin, building, in, fact, stradivari, s, early, career, is, marked, by, wide, experimentation, and, his, instruments, during, this, period, are, generally, considered, of, a, lesser, quality, than, his, later, work, however, the, precision, with, which, he, carved, the, heads, and, inserted, the, purfling, quickly, marked, him, as, one, of, the, most, dextrous, craftsmen, in, the, world, a, prime, example, of, this, being, the, 1690, tuscan, violin, pre, 1690, instruments, are, sometimes, termed, amatis, but, this, is, not, completely, accurate, it, is, largely, because, stradivari, created, many, more, instruments, later, on, that, people, try, to, connect, his, early, work, with, amati, s, style, by, 1680, stradivari, moved, to, no, 1, piazza, roma, formerly, no, 2, piazza, san, domenico, the, house, was, just, doors, away, from, those, of, several, other, violin, making, families, of, cremona, including, the, amatis, and, guarneris, stradivari, probably, worked, in, the, loft, and, attic, and, he, lived, in, this, house, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, the, early, 1690s, stradivari, made, a, pronounced, departure, from, this, earlier, style, of, instrument, making, changing, two, key, elements, of, his, instruments, first, he, began, to, make, violins, with, a, larger, pattern, than, previous, instruments, these, larger, violins, usually, are, known, as, long, strads, he, also, switched, to, using, a, darker, richer, varnish, as, opposed, to, a, yellower, varnish, similar, to, that, used, by, amati, he, continued, to, use, this, pattern, until, 1698, with, few, exceptions, between, 1698, and, 1700, he, abandoned, the, long, strad, model, and, returned, to, a, slightly, shorter, model, which, he, used, until, his, death, the, period, from, 1700, to, 1725, is, often, termed, the, golden, period, of, his, production, instruments, made, during, this, time, are, usually, considered, of, a, higher, quality, than, his, earlier, instruments, these, instruments, also, fetch, much, higher, prices, than, his, other, instruments, and, are, especially, prized, by, collectors, late, period, instruments, made, from, the, late, 1720s, until, his, death, in, 1737, show, signs, of, stradivari, s, advancing, age, these, late, instruments, may, be, a, bit, less, beautiful, than, the, golden, period, instruments, but, many, nonetheless, possess, a, fine, tone, heavier, and, looser, craftsmanship, of, the, late, stradivari, output, can, be, seen, in, the, 1734, habeneck, the, stradivari, parish, san, matteo, and, the, amati, parish, san, faustino, comprised, the, center, of, cremonese, violin, making, they, exerted, influence, on, one, another, s, shape, varnish, and, sound, of, instruments, but, also, on, many, of, their, contemporaries, they, defined, violin, making, standards, for, the, next, 300, years, even, at, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, stradivari, s, influence, could, be, seen, not, only, in, the, work, of, cremonese, makers, but, also, international, ones, such, as, barak, norman, s, one, of, the, first, important, british, makers, in, the, 1720s, daniel, parker, a, very, important, british, luthier, produced, fine, violins, after, stradivari, s, work, selling, anywhere, from, 30, 000, to, 60, 000, in, recent, auctions, parker, based, his, best, instruments, on, stradivari, s, long, pattern, having, the, opportunity, to, study, one, or, more, of, the, instruments, well, into, the, 19th, century, jean, baptiste, vuillaume, the, leading, french, luthier, of, his, time, also, made, many, important, copies, of, strads, and, guarneris, in, the, 18th, century, cremonese, luthiers, were, the, suppliers, and, local, players, on, the, demand, side, after, stradivari, s, death, this, drastically, changed, although, the, cremonese, luthiers, remained, the, suppliers, the, demand, side, now, consisted, mainly, of, collectors, researchers, imitators, profiteers, and, speculators, many, local, players, could, no, longer, afford, the, sought, out, instruments, and, most, of, the, purchased, instruments, would, be, hidden, in, private, collections, put, in, museums, or, simply, put, back, in, their, cases, hoping, that, they, would, gain, value, over, time, this, is, when, the, stradivari, fever, really, took, off, the, violin, collector, count, ignazio, alessandro, cozio, di, salabue, vuillaume, and, later, tarisio, auctions, have, all, contributed, to, this, frenzy, that, would, extend, well, into, the, 21st, century, also, most, of, the, other, major, cremonese, luthiers, died, soon, after, stradivari, putting, an, end, to, the, golden, period, of, cremona, s, violin, making, which, lasted, more, than, 150, years, starting, with, the, amatis, and, ending, with, the, cerutis, the, cremonese, maker, vincenzo, rugeri, 1663, 1719, while, staying, true, to, the, grand, amati, pattern, by, nicolo, amati, was, influenced, by, stradivari, in, that, he, adopted, a, somewhat, lower, arch, consistent, with, stradivarian, ideals, members, of, the, gagliano, family, such, as, gennaro, and, nicolo, made, excellent, copies, of, the, instruments, in, the, 1740s, though, the, only, similarity, to, stradivari, s, instruments, was, the, execution, of, the, form, and, arching, as, well, as, consistently, fine, and, detailed, varnish, nicolo, would, usually, use, the, forma, b, model, for, his, cellos, and, as, the, quality, of, the, output, steadily, declined, within, the, family, the, stradivari, models, were, almost, abandoned, in, naples, having, acquired, many, strads, from, paolo, stradivari, count, cozio, commissioned, giovanni, battista, guadagnini, to, make, some, replicas, of, the, instruments, although, many, features, of, strads, are, present, in, the, copies, they, still, remain, heavily, influenced, by, guadagnini, s, workshop, principles, and, represent, well, the, maker, s, turin, period, vincenzo, panormo, was, also, one, of, the, many, luthiers, who, based, many, of, his, violins, on, strads, he, learned, about, them, in, paris, between, 1779, and, 1789, when, he, worked, closely, with, l, opold, renaudin, another, one, of, strad, s, followers, stradivari, s, influence, could, also, be, seen, in, spain, with, the, outstanding, work, of, jos, contreras, of, granada, and, madrid, having, the, privilege, to, be, exposed, to, stradivari, s, instruments, through, the, spanish, court, he, was, experienced, enough, to, replace, the, scroll, of, a, 1717, stradivari, cello, and, possibly, even, make, its, back, and, ribs, he, had, a, great, ability, to, imitate, the, original, varnish, and, intricacy, of, the, instrument, the, 19th, century, was, not, as, eventful, in, comparison, to, the, previous, centuries, some, of, the, most, important, luthiers, from, this, part, of, history, include, giovanni, rota, as, well, as, the, two, non, italian, makers, fran, ois, chanot, in, france, and, the, artist, inventor, and, musician, william, sidney, mount, in, the, us, who, both, created, experimental, violins, the, 20th, century, was, the, so, called, rebirth, of, cremonese, making, when, luthiers, such, as, giuseppe, antonio, rocca, giovanni, battista, morassi, beltrami, and, the, antoniazzi, family, emerged, from, a, seemingly, uneventful, and, experimental, period, these, makers, sometimes, basing, their, early, violins, on, strads, would, later, on, make, their, own, models, and, would, inspire, each, other, s, work, even, though, antonio, had, a, very, long, working, life, it, is, impossible, for, him, to, have, crafted, more, than, 1, 000, instruments, entirely, by, himself, meaning, that, his, sons, francesco, and, omobono, as, well, as, possibly, a, third, son, must, have, been, working, on, and, off, in, his, shop, it, is, known, that, having, left, the, workshop, at, eighteen, omobono, made, a, few, instruments, on, his, own, such, as, the, blagrove, and, another, violin, dating, from, 1732, on, his, side, francesco, made, very, few, violins, independently, such, as, the, 1742, salabue, and, oliveira, spending, his, lifetime, in, his, father, s, shop, this, was, one, of, the, main, reasons, that, francesco, had, a, large, part, in, antonio, s, will, and, omobono, a, lesser, one, one, of, the, major, differences, between, antonio, and, his, sons, craftsmanship, was, the, quality, of, the, purfling, on, their, instruments, which, in, the, case, of, francesco, and, omobono, has, been, referred, to, as, startlingly, poor, only, a, handful, of, instruments, are, reliably, attributed, to, francesco, alone, two, authentic, labels, known, franciscus, stradivarius, cremonensis, filius, antonii, faciebat, anno, 1742, notably, it, omits, the, a, s, stamp, that, occurs, on, antonio, s, labels, another, label, states, sotto, la, disciplina, d, antonio, stradivari, f, in, cremona, 1737, this, is, of, course, the, year, of, his, father, s, death, and, the, phrase, sotto, la, disciplina, under, the, discipline, although, it, appears, in, a, few, other, instruments, may, here, be, a, particular, sign, of, his, respect, the, hills, violin, shop, estimates, that, stradivari, produced, 1, 116, instruments, of, which, 960, were, violins, it, is, also, estimated, that, around, 650, of, these, instruments, survive, including, 450, to, 512, violins, stradivari, s, instruments, are, regarded, as, amongst, the, finest, bowed, stringed, instruments, ever, created, are, highly, prized, and, are, still, played, by, professionals, today, his, violins, are, desired, more, than, those, of, any, other, luthier, except, his, contemporary, giuseppe, guarneri, del, ges, who, commands, a, similar, respect, among, violinists, however, neither, blind, listening, tests, nor, acoustic, analysis, have, ever, demonstrated, that, stradivarius, instruments, are, better, than, other, high, quality, instruments, or, even, reliably, distinguishable, from, them, while, the, usual, label, for, a, stradivarius, instrument, whether, genuine, or, false, uses, the, traditional, latin, inscription, after, the, mckinley, tariff, act, of, 1890, copies, were, also, inscribed, with, the, country, of, origin, since, thousands, of, instruments, are, based, on, stradivari, s, models, and, bear, the, same, name, as, his, models, many, unwary, people, are, deceived, into, purchasing, forged, stradivarius, instruments, which, can, be, avoided, by, authenticating, the, instrument, some, violinists, and, cellists, use, stradivari, instruments, in, their, work, yo, yo, ma,
