abu, rayhan, muhammad, ibn, ahmad, al, biruni, l, b, r, u, n, i, persian, arabic, 973, after, 1050, known, as, al, biruni, was, a, khwarazmian, iranian, scholar, and, polymath, during, the, islamic, golden, age, he, has, been, called, variously, father, of, comparative, religion, father, of, modern, geodesy, founder, of, indology, and, the, first, anthropologist, al, biruni, was, well, versed, in, physics, mathematics, astronomy, and, natural, sciences, and, also, distinguished, himself, as, a, historian, chronologist, and, linguist, he, studied, almost, all, the, sciences, of, his, day, and, was, rewarded, abundantly, for, his, tireless, research, in, many, fields, of, knowledge, royalty, and, other, powerful, elements, in, society, funded, al, biruni, s, research, and, sought, him, out, with, specific, projects, in, mind, influential, in, his, own, right, al, biruni, was, himself, influenced, by, the, scholars, of, other, nations, such, as, the, greeks, from, whom, he, took, inspiration, when, he, turned, to, the, study, of, philosophy, a, gifted, linguist, he, was, conversant, in, khwarezmian, persian, arabic, sanskrit, and, also, knew, greek, hebrew, and, syriac, he, spent, much, of, his, life, in, ghazni, then, capital, of, the, ghaznavids, in, modern, day, central, eastern, afghanistan, in, 1017, he, travelled, to, the, indian, subcontinent, and, wrote, a, treatise, on, indian, culture, entitled, t, r, kh, al, hind, the, history, of, india, after, exploring, the, hindu, faith, practiced, in, india, he, was, for, his, time, an, admirably, impartial, writer, on, the, customs, and, creeds, of, various, nations, his, scholarly, objectivity, earning, him, the, title, al, ustadh, the, master, in, recognition, of, his, remarkable, description, of, early, 11th, century, india, al, biruni, s, name, is, derived, from, the, persian, word, b, r, n, or, b, r, n, outskirts, as, he, was, born, in, an, outlying, district, of, kath, the, capital, of, the, afrighid, kingdom, of, khwarazm, the, city, now, called, beruniy, is, part, of, the, autonomous, republic, of, karakalpakstan, in, northwest, uzbekistan, his, name, was, most, commonly, latinized, as, alberonius, al, biruni, spent, the, first, twenty, five, years, of, his, life, in, khwarezm, where, he, studied, islamic, jurisprudence, theology, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and, philosophy, and, dabbled, not, only, in, the, field, of, physics, but, also, in, those, of, most, of, the, other, sciences, the, iranian, khwarezmian, language, which, was, biruni, s, mother, tongue, survived, for, several, centuries, after, islam, until, the, turkification, of, the, region, at, least, some, of, the, culture, of, ancient, khwarezm, endured, for, it, is, hard, to, imagine, that, the, commanding, figure, of, biruni, a, repository, of, so, much, knowledge, should, have, appeared, in, a, cultural, vacuum, he, was, sympathetic, to, the, afrighids, who, were, overthrown, by, the, rival, dynasty, of, ma, munids, in, 995, he, left, his, homeland, for, bukhara, then, under, the, samanid, ruler, mansur, ii, the, son, of, nuh, ii, there, he, corresponded, with, avicenna, and, there, are, extant, exchanges, of, views, between, these, two, scholars, in, 998, he, went, to, the, court, of, the, ziyarid, amir, of, tabaristan, qabus, r, 977, 981, 997, 1012, there, he, wrote, his, first, important, work, al, athar, al, baqqiya, an, al, qorun, al, khaliyya, the, remaining, traces, of, past, centuries, translated, as, chronology, of, ancient, nations, or, vestiges, of, the, past, on, historical, and, scientific, chronology, probably, around, 1000, though, he, later, made, some, amendments, to, the, book, he, also, visited, the, court, of, the, bavandid, ruler, al, marzuban, accepting, the, definite, demise, of, the, afrighids, at, the, hands, of, the, ma, munids, he, made, peace, with, the, latter, who, then, ruled, khwarezm, their, court, at, gorganj, also, in, khwarezm, was, gaining, fame, for, its, gathering, of, brilliant, scientists, in, 1017, mahmud, of, ghazni, captured, rey, most, scholars, including, al, biruni, were, taken, to, ghazni, the, capital, of, the, ghaznavid, dynasty, biruni, was, made, court, astrologer, and, accompanied, mahmud, on, his, invasions, into, india, living, there, for, a, few, years, he, was, 44, when, he, went, on, the, journeys, with, mahmud, of, ghazni, biruni, became, acquainted, with, all, things, related, to, india, during, this, time, he, wrote, his, study, of, india, finishing, it, around, 1030, along, with, his, writing, al, biruni, also, made, sure, to, extend, his, study, to, science, while, on, the, expeditions, he, sought, to, find, a, method, to, measure, the, height, of, the, sun, and, created, a, makeshift, quadrant, for, that, purpose, al, biruni, was, able, to, make, much, progress, in, his, study, over, the, frequent, travels, that, he, went, on, throughout, the, lands, of, india, belonging, to, the, sunni, ash, ari, school, al, biruni, nevertheless, also, associated, with, maturidi, theologians, he, was, however, very, critical, of, the, mu, tazila, particularly, criticising, al, jahiz, and, zurqan, he, also, repudiated, avicenna, for, his, views, on, the, eternality, of, the, universe, of, the, 146, books, written, by, al, b, r, n, 95, are, devoted, to, astronomy, mathematics, and, related, subjects, like, mathematical, geography, he, lived, during, the, islamic, golden, age, when, the, abbasid, caliphs, promoted, astronomical, research, because, such, research, possessed, not, only, a, scientific, but, also, a, religious, dimension, in, islam, worship, and, prayer, require, a, knowledge, of, the, precise, directions, of, sacred, locations, which, can, be, determined, accurately, only, through, the, use, of, astronomical, data, in, carrying, out, his, research, al, biruni, used, a, variety, of, different, techniques, dependent, upon, the, particular, field, of, study, involved, his, major, work, on, astrology, is, primarily, an, astronomical, and, mathematical, text, he, states, i, have, begun, with, geometry, and, proceeded, to, arithmetic, and, the, science, of, numbers, then, to, the, structure, of, the, universe, and, finally, to, judicial, astrology, for, no, one, who, is, worthy, of, the, style, and, title, of, astrologer, who, is, not, thoroughly, conversant, with, these, for, sciences, in, these, earlier, chapters, he, lays, the, foundations, for, the, final, chapter, on, astrological, prognostication, which, he, criticises, in, a, later, work, he, wrote, a, refutation, of, astrology, in, contradistinction, to, the, legitimate, science, of, astronomy, for, which, he, expresses, wholehearted, support, some, suggest, that, his, reasons, for, refuting, astrology, relate, to, the, methods, used, by, astrologers, being, based, upon, pseudoscience, rather, than, empiricism, and, also, to, a, conflict, between, the, views, of, the, astrologers, and, those, of, the, orthodox, theologians, of, sunni, islam, he, wrote, an, extensive, commentary, on, indian, astronomy, in, the, ta, q, q, m, li, l, hind, mostly, translation, of, aryabhatta, s, work, in, which, he, claims, to, have, resolved, the, matter, of, earth, s, rotation, in, a, work, on, astronomy, that, is, no, longer, extant, his, miftah, ilm, alhai, a, key, to, astronomy, he, rotation, of, the, earth, does, in, no, way, impair, the, value, of, astronomy, as, all, appearances, of, an, astronomic, character, can, quite, as, well, be, explained, according, to, this, theory, as, to, the, other, there, are, however, other, reasons, which, make, it, impossible, this, question, is, most, difficult, to, solve, the, most, prominent, of, both, modern, and, ancient, astronomers, have, deeply, studied, the, question, of, the, moving, of, the, earth, and, tried, to, refute, it, we, too, have, composed, a, book, on, the, subject, called, miftah, ilm, alhai, a, key, to, astronomy, in, which, we, think, we, have, surpassed, our, predecessors, if, not, in, the, words, at, all, events, in, the, matter, in, his, major, astronomical, work, the, mas, ud, canon, biruni, observed, that, contrary, to, ptolemy, the, sun, s, apogee, highest, point, in, the, heavens, was, mobile, not, fixed, he, wrote, a, treatise, on, the, astrolabe, describing, how, to, use, it, to, tell, the, time, and, as, a, quadrant, for, surveying, one, particular, diagram, of, an, eight, geared, device, could, be, considered, an, ancestor, of, later, muslim, astrolabes, and, clocks, more, recently, biruni, s, eclipse, data, was, used, by, dunthorne, in, 1749, to, help, determine, the, acceleration, of, the, moon, and, his, data, on, equinox, times, and, eclipses, was, used, as, part, of, a, study, of, earth, s, past, rotation, like, later, adherents, of, the, ash, ari, school, such, as, al, ghazali, al, biruni, is, famous, for, vehemently, defending, the, majority, sunni, position, that, the, universe, had, a, beginning, being, a, strong, supporter, of, creatio, ex, nihilo, specifically, refuting, the, philosopher, ibn, sina, in, a, multiple, letter, correspondence, al, biruni, stated, other, people, besides, hold, this, foolish, persuasion, that, time, has, no, terminus, quo, at, all, he, further, stated, that, aristotle, whose, arguments, avicenna, uses, contradicted, himself, when, he, stated, that, the, universe, and, matter, has, a, start, whilst, holding, on, to, the, idea, that, matter, is, pre, eternal, in, his, letters, to, avicenna, he, stated, the, argument, of, aristotle, that, there, is, a, change, in, the, creator, he, further, argued, that, stating, there, is, a, change, in, the, creator, would, mean, there, is, a, change, in, the, effect, meaning, the, universe, has, change, and, that, the, universe, coming, into, being, after, not, being, is, such, a, change, and, so, arguing, there, is, no, change, no, beginning, means, aristotle, believes, the, creator, is, negated, al, biruni, was, proud, of, the, fact, that, he, followed, the, textual, evidence, of, the, religion, without, being, influenced, by, greek, philosophers, such, as, aristotle, al, biruni, contributed, to, the, introduction, of, the, scientific, method, to, medieval, mechanics, he, developed, experimental, methods, to, determine, density, using, a, particular, type, of, hydrostatic, balance, al, biruni, s, method, of, using, the, hydrostatic, balance, was, precise, and, he, was, able, to, measure, the, density, of, many, different, substances, including, precious, metals, gems, and, even, air, he, also, used, this, method, to, determine, the, radius, of, the, earth, which, he, did, by, measuring, the, angle, of, elevation, of, the, horizon, from, the, top, of, a, mountain, and, comparing, it, to, the, angle, of, elevation, of, the, horizon, from, a, nearby, plain, in, addition, to, developing, the, hydrostatic, balance, al, biruni, also, wrote, extensively, on, the, topic, of, density, including, the, different, types, of, densities, and, how, they, are, measured, his, work, on, the, subject, was, very, influential, and, was, later, used, by, scientists, like, galileo, and, newton, in, their, own, research, b, r, n, devised, a, novel, method, of, determining, the, earth, s, radius, by, means, of, the, observation, of, the, height, of, a, mountain, he, carried, it, out, at, nandana, in, pind, dadan, khan, present, day, pakistan, he, used, trigonometry, to, calculate, the, radius, of, the, earth, using, measurements, of, the, height, of, a, hill, and, measurement, of, the, dip, in, the, horizon, from, the, top, of, that, hill, his, calculated, radius, for, the, earth, of, 3928, 77, miles, was, 2, higher, than, the, actual, mean, radius, of, 3847, 80, miles, his, estimate, was, given, as, 12, 803, 337, cubits, so, the, accuracy, of, his, estimate, compared, to, the, modern, value, depends, on, what, conversion, is, used, for, cubits, the, exact, length, of, a, cubit, is, not, clear, with, an, 18, inch, cubit, his, estimate, would, be, 3, 600, miles, whereas, with, a, 22, inch, cubit, his, estimate, would, be, 4, 200, miles, one, significant, problem, with, this, approach, is, that, al, biruni, was, not, aware, of, atmospheric, refraction, and, made, no, allowance, for, it, he, used, a, dip, angle, of, 34, arc, minutes, in, his, calculations, but, refraction, can, typically, alter, the, measured, dip, angle, by, about, 1, 6, making, his, calculation, only, accurate, to, within, about, 20, of, the, true, value, in, his, codex, masudicus, 1037, al, biruni, theorized, the, existence, of, a, landmass, along, the, vast, ocean, between, asia, and, europe, or, what, is, today, known, as, the, americas, he, argued, for, its, existence, on, the, basis, of, his, accurate, estimations, of, the, earth, s, circumference, and, afro, eurasia, s, size, which, he, found, spanned, only, two, fifths, of, the, earth, s, circumference, reasoning, that, the, geological, processes, that, gave, rise, to, eurasia, must, surely, have, given, rise, to, lands, in, the, vast, ocean, between, asia, and, europe, he, also, theorized, that, at, least, some, of, the, unknown, landmass, would, lie, within, the, known, latitudes, which, humans, could, inhabit, and, therefore, would, be, inhabited, biruni, wrote, a, pharmacopoeia, the, kitab, al, saydala, fi, al, tibb, book, on, the, pharmacopoeia, of, medicine, it, lists, synonyms, for, drug, names, in, syriac, persian, greek, baluchi, afghan, kurdi, and, some, indian, languages, he, used, a, hydrostatic, balance, to, determine, the, density, and, purity, of, metals, and, precious, stones, he, classified, gems, by, what, he, considered, their, primary, physical, properties, such, as, specific, gravity, and, hardness, rather, than, the, common, practice, of, the, time, of, classifying, them, by, colour, biruni, s, main, essay, on, political, history, kit, b, al, mus, mara, f, a, b, r, razm, book, of, nightly, conversation, concerning, the, affairs, of, razm, is, now, known, only, from, quotations, in, bayhaq, s, t, r, kh, e, mas, d, in, addition, to, this, various, discussions, of, historical, events, and, methodology, are, found, in, connection, with, the, lists, of, kings, in, his, al, th, r, al, b, qiya, and, in, the, q, n, n, as, well, as, elsewhere, in, the, th, r, in, india, and, scattered, throughout, his, other, works, al, biruni, s, chronology, of, ancient, nations, attempted, to, accurately, establish, the, length, of, various, historical, eras, biruni, is, widely, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, muslim, authorities, on, the, history, of, religion, he, is, known, as, a, pioneer, in, the, field, of, comparative, religion, in, his, study, of, among, other, creeds, zoroastrianism, judaism, hinduism, christianity, buddhism, and, islam, he, assumed, the, superiority, of, islam, we, have, here, given, an, account, of, these, things, in, order, that, the, reader, may, learn, by, the, comparative, treatment, of, the, subject, how, much, superior, the, institutions, of, islam, are, and, how, more, plainly, this, contrast, brings, out, all, customs, and, usages, differing, from, those, of, islam, in, their, essential, foulness, however, he, was, happy, on, occasion, to, express, admiration, for, other, cultures, and, quoted, directly, from, the, sacred, texts, of, other, religions, when, reaching, his, conclusions, he, strove, to, understand, them, on, their, own, terms, rather, than, trying, to, prove, them, wrong, his, underlying, concept, was, that, all, cultures, are, at, least, distant, relatives, of, all, other, cultures, because, they, are, all, human, constructs, rather, what, al, biruni, seems, to, be, arguing, is, that, there, is, a, common, human, element, in, every, culture, that, makes, all, cultures, distant, relatives, however, foreign, they, might, seem, to, one, another, al, biruni, divides, hindus, into, an, educated, and, an, uneducated, class, he, describes, the, educated, as, monotheistic, believing, that, god, is, one, eternal, and, omnipotent, and, eschewing, all, forms, of, idol, worship, he, recognizes, that, uneducated, hindus, worshiped, a, multiplicity, of, idols, yet, points, out, that, even, some, muslims, such, as, the, jabriyah, have, adopted, anthropomorphic, concepts, of, god, al, biruni, wrote, about, the, peoples, customs, and, religions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, according, to, akbar, s, ahmed, like, modern, anthropologists, he, engaged, in, extensive, participant, observation, with, a, given, group, of, people, learnt, their, language, and, studied, their, primary, texts, presenting, his, findings, with, objectivity, and, neutrality, using, cross, cultural, comparisons, akhbar, s, ahmed, concluded, that, al, biruni, can, be, considered, as, the, first, anthropologist, others, however, have, argued, that, he, can, hardly, be, considered, an, anthropologist, in, the, conventional, sense, biruni, s, fame, as, an, indologist, rests, primarily, on, two, texts, biruni, wrote, an, encyclopedic, work, on, india, called, ta, q, q, m, li, l, hind, min, maq, lah, maqb, lah, f, al, aql, aw, mardh, lah, variously, translated, as, verifying, all, that, the, indians, recount, the, reasonable, and, the, unreasonable, or, the, book, confirming, what, pertains, to, india, whether, rational, or, despicable, in, which, he, explored, nearly, every, aspect, of, indian, life, during, his, journey, through, india, military, and, political, history, were, not, biruni, s, main, focus, he, decided, rather, to, document, the, civilian, and, scholarly, aspects, of, hindu, life, examining, culture, science, and, religion, he, explored, religion, within, a, rich, cultural, context, he, expressed, his, objectives, with, simple, eloquence, he, also, translated, the, yoga, sutras, of, indian, sage, patanjali, with, the, title, tarjamat, ket, b, b, tanjal, fi, l, al, men, al, erteb, k, i, shall, not, produce, the, arguments, of, our, antagonists, in, order, to, refute, such, of, them, as, i, believe, to, be, in, the, wrong, my, book, is, nothing, but, a, simple, historic, record, of, facts, i, shall, place, before, the, reader, the, theories, of, the, hindus, exactly, as, they, are, and, i, shall, mention, in, connection, with, them, similar, theories, of, the, greeks, in, order, to, show, the, relationship, existing, between, them, an, example, of, biruni, s, analysis, is, his, summary, of, why, many, hindus, hate, muslims, biruni, notes, in, the, beginning, of, his, book, how, the, muslims, had, a, hard, time, learning, about, hindu, knowledge, and, culture, he, explains, that, hinduism, and, islam, are, totally, different, from, each, other, moreover, hindus, in, 11th, century, india, had, suffered, waves, of, destructive, attacks, on, many, of, its, cities, and, islamic, armies, had, taken, numerous, hindu, slaves, to, persia, which, claimed, biruni, contributed, to, hindus, becoming, suspicious, of, all, foreigners, not, just, muslims, hindus, considered, muslims, violent, and, impure, and, did, not, want, to, share, anything, with, them, over, time, biruni, won, the, welcome, of, hindu, scholars, al, biruni, collected, books, and, studied, with, these, hindu, scholars, to, become, fluent, in, sanskrit, discover, and, translate, into, arabic, the, mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy, and, other, fields, of, arts, as, practiced, in, 11th, century, india, he, was, inspired, by, the, arguments, offered, by, indian, scholars, who, believed, earth, must, be, globular, in, shape, which, they, felt, was, the, only, way, to, fully, explain, the, difference, in, daylight, hours, by, latitude, seasons, and, earth, s, relative, positions, with, moon, and, stars, at, the, same, time, biruni, was, also, critical, of, indian, scribes, who, he, believed, carelessly, corrupted, indian, documents, while, making, copies, of, older, documents, he, also, criticized, the, hindus, on, what, he, saw, them, do, and, not, do, for, example, finding, them, deficient, in, curiosity, about, history, and, religion, one, of, the, specific, aspects, of, hindu, life, that, biruni, studied, was, the, hindu, calendar, his, scholarship, on, the, topic, exhibited, great, determination, and, focus, not, to, mention, the, excellence, in, his, approach, of, the, in, depth, research, he, performed, he, developed, a, method, for, converting, the, dates, of, the, hindu, calendar, to, the, dates, of, the, three, different, calendars, that, were, common, in, the, islamic, countries, of, his, time, period, the, greek, the, arab, muslim, and, the, persian, biruni, also, employed, astronomy, in, the, determination, of, his, theories, which, were, complex, mathematical, equations, and, scientific, calculation, that, allows, one, to, convert, dates, and, years, between, the, different, calendars, the, book, does, not, limit, itself, to, tedious, records, of, battle, because, biruni, found, the, social, culture, to, be, more, important, the, work, includes, research, on, a, vast, array, of, topics, of, indian, culture, including, descriptions, of, their, traditions, and, customs, although, he, tried, to, stay, away, from, political, and, military, history, biruni, did, indeed, record, important, dates, and, noted, actual, sites, of, where, significant, battles, occurred, additionally, he, chronicled, stories, of, indian, rulers, and, told, of, how, they, ruled, over, their, people, with, their, beneficial, actions, and, acted, in, the, interests, of, the, nation, his, details, are, brief, and, mostly, just, list, rulers, without, referring, to, their, real, names, and, he, did, not, go, on, about, deeds, that, each, one, carried, out, during, their, reign, which, keeps, in, line, with, biruni, s, mission, to, try, to, stay, away, from, political, histories, biruni, also, described, the, geography, of, india, in, his, work, he, documented, different, bodies, of, water, and, other, natural, phenomena, these, descriptions, are, useful, to, today, s, modern, historians, because, they, are, able, to, use, biruni, s, scholarship, to, locate, certain, destinations, in, modern, day, india, historians, are, able, to, make, some, matches, while, also, concluding, that, certain, areas, seem, to, have, disappeared, and, been, replaced, with, different, cities, different, forts, and, landmarks, were, able, to, be, located, legitimizing, biruni, s, contributions, with, their, usefulness, to, even, modern, history, and, archeology, the, dispassionate, account, of, hinduism, given, by, biruni, was, remarkable, for, its, time, he, stated, that, he, was, fully, objective, in, his, writings, remaining, unbiased, like, a, proper, historian, should, biruni, documented, everything, about, india, just, as, it, happened, but, he, did, note, how, some, of, the, accounts, of, information, that, he, was, given, by, natives, of, the, land, may, not, have, been, reliable, in, terms, of, complete, accuracy, however, he, did, try, to, be, as, honest, as, possible, in, his, writing, eduard, sachau, compares, it, to, a, magic, island, of, quiet, impartial, research, in, the, midst, of, a, world, of, clashing, swords, burning, towns, and, plundered, temples, biruni, s, writing, was, very, poetic, which, may, diminish, some, of, the, historical, value, of, the, work, for, modern, times, the, lack, of, description, of, battle, and, politics, makes, those, parts, of, the, picture, completely, lost, however, many, have, used, biruni, s, work, to, check, facts, of, history, in, other, works, that, may, have, been, ambiguous, or, had, their, validity, questioned, most, of, the, works, of, al, biruni, are, in, arabic, although, he, seemingly, wrote, the, kitab, al, tafhim, in, both, persian, and, arabic, showing, his, mastery, over, both, languages, b, r, n, s, catalogue, of, his, own, literary, production, up, to, his, 65th, lunar, 63rd, solar, year, the, end, of, 427, 1036, lists, 103, titles, divided, into, 12, categories, astronomy, mathematical, geography, mathematics, astrological, aspects, and, transits, astronomical, instruments, chronology, comets, an, untitled, category, astrology, anecdotes, religion, and, books, he, no, longer, possesses, biruni, wrote, most, of, his, works, in, arabic, the, scientific, language, of, his, age, but, al, tafhim, is, one, of, the, most, important, of, the, early, works, of, science, in, persian, and, is, a, rich, source, for, persian, prose, and, lexicography, the, book, covers, the, quadrivium, in, a, detailed, and, skilled, fashion, following, al, biruni, s, death, his, work, was, neither, built, upon, or, referenced, by, scholars, centuries, later, his, writings, about, india, which, had, become, of, interest, to, the, british, raj, were, revisited, the, lunar, crater, al, biruni, and, the, asteroid, 9936, al, biruni, are, named, in, his, honour,
