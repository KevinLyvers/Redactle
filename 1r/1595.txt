pythagoras, of, samos, ancient, greek, c, 570, c, 495, bc, was, an, ancient, ionian, greek, philosopher, polymath, and, the, eponymous, founder, of, pythagoreanism, his, political, and, religious, teachings, were, well, known, in, magna, graecia, and, influenced, the, philosophies, of, plato, aristotle, and, through, them, the, west, in, general, knowledge, of, his, life, is, clouded, by, legend, modern, scholars, disagree, regarding, pythagoras, s, education, and, influences, but, they, do, agree, that, around, 530, bc, he, travelled, to, croton, in, southern, italy, where, he, founded, a, school, in, which, initiates, were, sworn, to, secrecy, and, lived, a, communal, ascetic, lifestyle, in, antiquity, pythagoras, was, credited, with, many, mathematical, and, scientific, discoveries, including, the, pythagorean, theorem, pythagorean, tuning, the, five, regular, solids, the, theory, of, proportions, the, sphericity, of, the, earth, and, the, identity, of, the, morning, and, evening, stars, as, the, planet, venus, it, was, said, that, he, was, the, first, man, to, call, himself, a, philosopher, lover, of, wisdom, and, that, he, was, the, first, to, divide, the, globe, into, five, climatic, zones, classical, historians, debate, whether, pythagoras, made, these, discoveries, and, many, of, the, accomplishments, credited, to, him, likely, originated, earlier, or, were, made, by, his, colleagues, or, successors, some, accounts, mention, that, the, philosophy, associated, with, pythagoras, was, related, to, mathematics, and, that, numbers, were, important, but, it, is, debated, to, what, extent, if, at, all, he, actually, contributed, to, mathematics, or, natural, philosophy, the, teaching, most, securely, identified, with, pythagoras, is, the, transmigration, of, souls, or, metempsychosis, which, holds, that, every, soul, is, immortal, and, upon, death, enters, into, a, new, body, he, may, have, also, devised, the, doctrine, of, musica, universalis, which, holds, that, the, planets, move, according, to, mathematical, equations, and, thus, resonate, to, produce, an, inaudible, symphony, of, music, scholars, debate, whether, pythagoras, developed, the, numerological, and, musical, teachings, attributed, to, him, or, if, those, teachings, were, developed, by, his, later, followers, particularly, philolaus, of, croton, following, croton, s, decisive, victory, over, sybaris, in, around, 510, bc, pythagoras, s, followers, came, into, conflict, with, supporters, of, democracy, and, pythagorean, meeting, houses, were, burned, pythagoras, may, have, been, killed, during, this, persecution, or, he, may, have, escaped, to, metapontum, and, died, there, pythagoras, influenced, plato, whose, dialogues, especially, his, timaeus, exhibit, pythagorean, teachings, pythagorean, ideas, on, mathematical, perfection, also, impacted, ancient, greek, art, his, teachings, underwent, a, major, revival, in, the, first, century, bc, among, middle, platonists, coinciding, with, the, rise, of, neopythagoreanism, pythagoras, continued, to, be, regarded, as, a, great, philosopher, throughout, the, middle, ages, and, his, philosophy, had, a, major, impact, on, scientists, such, as, nicolaus, copernicus, johannes, kepler, and, isaac, newton, pythagorean, symbolism, was, also, used, throughout, early, modern, european, esotericism, and, his, teachings, as, portrayed, in, ovid, s, metamorphoses, would, later, influence, the, modern, vegetarian, movement, no, authentic, writings, of, pythagoras, have, survived, and, almost, nothing, is, known, for, certain, about, his, life, the, earliest, sources, on, pythagoras, s, life, are, brief, ambiguous, and, often, satirical, the, earliest, source, on, pythagoras, s, teachings, is, a, satirical, poem, probably, written, after, his, death, by, the, greek, philosopher, xenophanes, of, colophon, c, 570, c, 478, bc, who, had, been, one, of, his, contemporaries, in, the, poem, xenophanes, describes, pythagoras, interceding, on, behalf, of, a, dog, that, is, being, beaten, professing, to, recognize, in, its, cries, the, voice, of, a, departed, friend, alcmaeon, of, croton, fl, c, 450, bc, a, doctor, who, lived, in, croton, at, around, the, same, time, pythagoras, lived, there, incorporates, many, pythagorean, teachings, into, his, writings, and, alludes, to, having, possibly, known, pythagoras, personally, the, poet, heraclitus, of, ephesus, fl, c, 500, bc, who, was, born, across, a, few, miles, of, sea, away, from, samos, and, may, have, lived, within, pythagoras, s, lifetime, mocked, pythagoras, as, a, clever, charlatan, remarking, that, pythagoras, son, of, mnesarchus, practiced, inquiry, more, than, any, other, man, and, selecting, from, these, writings, he, manufactured, a, wisdom, for, himself, much, learning, artful, knavery, the, greek, poets, ion, of, chios, c, 480, c, 421, bc, and, empedocles, of, acragas, c, 493, c, 432, bc, both, express, admiration, for, pythagoras, in, their, poems, the, first, concise, description, of, pythagoras, comes, from, the, historian, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, c, 484, c, 420, bc, who, describes, him, as, one, of, the, greatest, greek, teachers, and, states, that, pythagoras, taught, his, followers, how, to, attain, immortality, the, accuracy, of, the, works, of, herodotus, is, controversial, the, writings, attributed, to, the, pythagorean, philosopher, philolaus, of, croton, c, 470, c, 385, bc, are, the, earliest, texts, to, describe, the, numerological, and, musical, theories, that, were, later, ascribed, to, pythagoras, the, athenian, rhetorician, isocrates, c, 436, c, 338, bc, was, the, first, to, describe, pythagoras, as, having, visited, egypt, aristotle, c, 384, c, 322, bc, wrote, a, treatise, on, the, pythagoreans, which, no, longer, exists, some, of, it, may, be, preserved, in, the, protrepticus, aristotle, s, disciples, dicaearchus, aristoxenus, and, heraclides, ponticus, who, all, lived, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, also, wrote, on, the, same, subject, most, of, the, major, sources, on, pythagoras, s, life, are, from, the, roman, period, by, which, point, according, to, the, german, classicist, walter, burkert, the, history, of, pythagoreanism, was, already, the, laborious, reconstruction, of, something, lost, and, gone, three, ancient, biographies, of, pythagoras, have, survived, from, late, antiquity, all, of, which, are, filled, primarily, with, myths, and, legends, the, earliest, and, most, respectable, of, these, is, the, one, from, diogenes, la, rtius, s, lives, and, opinions, of, eminent, philosophers, the, two, later, biographies, were, written, by, the, neoplatonist, philosophers, porphyry, and, iamblichus, and, were, partially, intended, as, polemics, against, the, rise, of, christianity, the, later, sources, are, much, lengthier, than, the, earlier, ones, and, even, more, fantastic, in, their, descriptions, of, pythagoras, s, achievements, porphyry, and, iamblichus, used, material, from, the, lost, writings, of, aristotle, s, disciples, dicaearchus, aristoxenus, and, heraclides, and, material, taken, from, these, sources, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, most, reliable, there, is, not, a, single, detail, in, the, life, of, pythagoras, that, stands, uncontradicted, but, it, is, possible, from, a, more, or, less, critical, selection, of, the, data, to, construct, a, plausible, account, herodotus, isocrates, and, other, early, writers, agree, that, pythagoras, was, the, son, of, mnesarchus, and, that, he, was, born, on, the, greek, island, of, samos, in, the, eastern, aegean, according, to, these, biographers, pythagoras, father, was, not, born, on, the, island, although, he, got, naturalized, there, but, according, to, iamblichus, he, was, a, native, of, the, island, he, is, said, to, have, been, a, gem, engraver, or, a, wealthy, merchant, but, his, ancestry, is, disputed, and, unclear, his, mother, was, a, native, of, samos, descending, from, a, geomoroi, family, apollonius, of, tyana, gives, her, name, as, pytha, s, iamblichus, tells, the, story, that, the, pythia, prophesied, to, her, while, she, was, pregnant, with, him, that, she, would, give, birth, to, a, man, supremely, beautiful, wise, and, beneficial, to, humankind, as, to, the, date, of, his, birth, aristoxenus, stated, that, pythagoras, left, samos, in, the, reign, of, polycrates, at, the, age, of, 40, which, would, give, a, date, of, birth, around, 570, bc, pythagoras, s, name, led, him, to, be, associated, with, pythian, apollo, p, th, aristippus, of, cyrene, in, the, 4th, century, bc, explained, his, name, by, saying, he, spoke, the, truth, no, less, than, did, the, pythian, during, pythagoras, s, formative, years, samos, was, a, thriving, cultural, hub, known, for, its, feats, of, advanced, architectural, engineering, including, the, building, of, the, tunnel, of, eupalinos, and, for, its, riotous, festival, culture, it, was, a, major, center, of, trade, in, the, aegean, where, traders, brought, goods, from, the, near, east, according, to, christiane, l, joost, gaugier, these, traders, almost, certainly, brought, with, them, near, eastern, ideas, and, traditions, pythagoras, s, early, life, also, coincided, with, the, flowering, of, early, ionian, natural, philosophy, he, was, a, contemporary, of, the, philosophers, anaximander, anaximenes, and, the, historian, hecataeus, all, of, whom, lived, in, miletus, across, the, sea, from, samos, pythagoras, is, traditionally, thought, to, have, received, most, of, his, education, in, the, near, east, modern, scholarship, has, shown, that, the, culture, of, archaic, greece, was, heavily, influenced, by, those, of, levantine, and, mesopotamian, cultures, like, many, other, important, greek, thinkers, pythagoras, was, said, to, have, studied, in, egypt, by, the, time, of, isocrates, in, the, fourth, century, bc, pythagoras, s, reputed, studies, in, egypt, were, already, taken, as, fact, the, writer, antiphon, who, may, have, lived, during, the, hellenistic, era, claimed, in, his, lost, work, on, men, of, outstanding, merit, used, as, a, source, by, porphyry, that, pythagoras, learned, to, speak, egyptian, from, the, pharaoh, amasis, ii, himself, that, he, studied, with, the, egyptian, priests, at, diospolis, thebes, and, that, he, was, the, only, foreigner, ever, to, be, granted, the, privilege, of, taking, part, in, their, worship, the, middle, platonist, biographer, plutarch, c, 46, c, 120, ad, writes, in, his, treatise, on, isis, and, osiris, that, during, his, visit, to, egypt, pythagoras, received, instruction, from, the, egyptian, priest, oenuphis, of, heliopolis, meanwhile, solon, received, lectures, from, a, sonchis, of, sais, according, to, the, christian, theologian, clement, of, alexandria, c, 150, c, 215, ad, pythagoras, was, a, disciple, of, sonchis, an, egyptian, archprophet, as, well, as, a, plato, of, sechnuphis, some, ancient, writers, claimed, that, pythagoras, learned, geometry, and, the, doctrine, of, metempsychosis, from, the, egyptians, other, ancient, writers, however, claimed, that, pythagoras, had, learned, these, teachings, from, the, magi, in, persia, or, even, from, zoroaster, himself, diogenes, la, rtius, asserts, that, pythagoras, later, visited, crete, where, he, went, to, the, cave, of, ida, with, epimenides, the, phoenicians, are, reputed, to, have, taught, pythagoras, arithmetic, and, the, chaldeans, to, have, taught, him, astronomy, by, the, third, century, bc, pythagoras, was, already, reported, to, have, studied, under, the, jews, as, well, contradicting, all, these, reports, the, novelist, antonius, diogenes, writing, in, the, second, century, bc, reports, that, pythagoras, discovered, all, his, doctrines, himself, by, interpreting, dreams, the, third, century, ad, sophist, philostratus, claims, that, in, addition, to, the, egyptians, pythagoras, also, studied, under, sages, or, gymnosophists, in, india, iamblichus, expands, this, list, even, further, by, claiming, that, pythagoras, also, studied, with, the, celts, and, iberians, ancient, sources, also, record, pythagoras, having, studied, under, a, variety, of, native, greek, thinkers, some, identify, hermodamas, of, samos, as, a, possible, tutor, hermodamas, represented, the, indigenous, samian, rhapsodic, tradition, and, his, father, creophylos, was, said, to, have, been, the, host, of, his, rival, poet, homer, others, credit, bias, of, priene, thales, or, anaximander, a, pupil, of, thales, other, traditions, claim, the, mythic, bard, orpheus, as, pythagoras, s, teacher, thus, representing, the, orphic, mysteries, the, neoplatonists, wrote, of, a, sacred, discourse, pythagoras, had, written, on, the, gods, in, the, doric, greek, dialect, which, they, believed, had, been, dictated, to, pythagoras, by, the, orphic, priest, aglaophamus, upon, his, initiation, to, the, orphic, mysteries, at, leibethra, iamblichus, credited, orpheus, with, having, been, the, model, for, pythagoras, s, manner, of, speech, his, spiritual, attitude, and, his, manner, of, worship, iamblichus, describes, pythagoreanism, as, a, synthesis, of, everything, pythagoras, had, learned, from, orpheus, from, the, egyptian, priests, from, the, eleusinian, mysteries, and, from, other, religious, and, philosophical, traditions, riedweg, states, that, although, these, stories, are, fanciful, pythagoras, s, teachings, were, definitely, influenced, by, orphism, to, a, noteworthy, extent, of, the, various, greek, sages, claimed, to, have, taught, pythagoras, pherecydes, of, syros, is, mentioned, most, often, similar, miracle, stories, were, told, about, both, pythagoras, and, pherecydes, including, one, in, which, the, hero, predicts, a, shipwreck, one, in, which, he, predicts, the, conquest, of, messina, and, one, in, which, he, drinks, from, a, well, and, predicts, an, earthquake, apollonius, paradoxographus, a, paradoxographer, who, may, have, lived, in, the, second, century, bc, identified, pythagoras, s, thaumaturgic, ideas, as, a, result, of, pherecydes, s, influence, another, story, which, may, be, traced, to, the, neopythagorean, philosopher, nicomachus, tells, that, when, pherecydes, was, old, and, dying, on, the, island, of, delos, pythagoras, returned, to, care, for, him, and, pay, his, respects, duris, the, historian, and, tyrant, of, samos, is, reported, to, have, patriotically, boasted, of, an, epitaph, supposedly, penned, by, pherecydes, which, declared, that, pythagoras, s, wisdom, exceeded, his, own, on, the, grounds, of, all, these, references, connecting, pythagoras, with, pherecydes, riedweg, concludes, that, there, may, well, be, some, historical, foundation, to, the, tradition, that, pherecydes, was, pythagoras, s, teacher, pythagoras, and, pherecydes, also, appear, to, have, shared, similar, views, on, the, soul, and, the, teaching, of, metempsychosis, before, 520, bc, on, one, of, his, visits, to, egypt, or, greece, pythagoras, might, have, met, thales, of, miletus, who, would, have, been, around, fifty, four, years, older, than, him, thales, was, a, philosopher, scientist, mathematician, and, engineer, also, known, for, a, special, case, of, the, inscribed, angle, theorem, pythagoras, s, birthplace, the, island, of, samos, is, situated, in, the, northeast, aegean, sea, not, far, from, miletus, diogenes, la, rtius, cites, a, statement, from, aristoxenus, fourth, century, bc, stating, that, pythagoras, learned, most, of, his, moral, doctrines, from, the, delphic, priestess, themistoclea, porphyry, agrees, with, this, assertion, but, calls, the, priestess, aristoclea, aristokleia, ancient, authorities, furthermore, note, the, similarities, between, the, religious, and, ascetic, peculiarities, of, pythagoras, with, the, orphic, or, cretan, mysteries, or, the, delphic, oracle, porphyry, repeats, an, account, from, antiphon, who, reported, that, while, he, was, still, on, samos, pythagoras, founded, a, school, known, as, the, semicircle, here, samians, debated, matters, of, public, concern, supposedly, the, school, became, so, renowned, that, the, brightest, minds, in, all, of, greece, came, to, samos, to, hear, pythagoras, teach, pythagoras, himself, dwelled, in, a, secret, cave, where, he, studied, in, private, and, occasionally, held, discourses, with, a, few, of, his, close, friends, christoph, riedweg, a, german, scholar, of, early, pythagoreanism, states, that, it, is, entirely, possible, pythagoras, may, have, taught, on, samos, but, cautions, that, antiphon, s, account, which, makes, reference, to, a, specific, building, that, was, still, in, use, during, his, own, time, appears, to, be, motivated, by, samian, patriotic, interest, around, 530, bc, when, pythagoras, was, about, forty, years, old, he, left, samos, his, later, admirers, claimed, that, he, left, because, he, disagreed, with, the, tyranny, of, polycrates, in, samos, riedweg, notes, that, this, explanation, closely, aligns, with, nicomachus, s, emphasis, on, pythagoras, s, purported, love, of, freedom, but, that, pythagoras, s, enemies, portrayed, him, as, having, a, proclivity, towards, tyranny, other, accounts, claim, that, pythagoras, left, samos, because, he, was, so, overburdened, with, public, duties, in, samos, because, of, the, high, estimation, in, which, he, was, held, by, his, fellow, citizens, he, arrived, in, the, greek, colony, of, croton, today, s, crotone, in, calabria, in, what, was, then, magna, graecia, all, sources, agree, that, pythagoras, was, charismatic, and, quickly, acquired, great, political, influence, in, his, new, environment, he, served, as, an, advisor, to, the, elites, in, croton, and, gave, them, frequent, advice, later, biographers, tell, fantastical, stories, of, the, effects, of, his, eloquent, speeches, in, leading, the, people, of, croton, to, abandon, their, luxurious, and, corrupt, way, of, life, and, devote, themselves, to, the, purer, system, which, he, came, to, introduce, diogenes, la, rtius, states, that, pythagoras, did, not, indulge, in, the, pleasures, of, love, and, that, he, cautioned, others, to, only, have, sex, whenever, you, are, willing, to, be, weaker, than, yourself, according, to, porphyry, pythagoras, married, theano, a, lady, of, crete, and, the, daughter, of, pythenax, and, had, several, children, with, her, porphyry, writes, that, pythagoras, had, two, sons, named, telauges, and, arignote, and, a, daughter, named, myia, who, took, precedence, among, the, maidens, in, croton, and, when, a, wife, among, married, women, iamblichus, mentions, none, of, these, children, and, instead, only, mentions, a, son, named, mnesarchus, after, his, grandfather, this, son, was, raised, by, pythagoras, s, appointed, successor, aristaeus, and, eventually, took, over, the, school, when, aristaeus, was, too, old, to, continue, running, it, suda, writes, that, pythagoras, had, 4, children, telauges, mnesarchus, myia, and, arignote, the, wrestler, milo, of, croton, was, said, to, have, been, a, close, associate, of, pythagoras, and, was, credited, with, having, saved, the, philosopher, s, life, when, a, roof, was, about, to, collapse, this, association, may, have, been, the, result, of, confusion, with, a, different, man, named, pythagoras, who, was, an, athletics, trainer, diogenes, la, rtius, records, milo, s, wife, s, name, as, myia, iamblichus, mentions, theano, as, the, wife, of, brontinus, of, croton, diogenes, la, rtius, states, that, the, same, theano, was, pythagoras, s, pupil, and, that, pythagoras, s, wife, theano, was, her, daughter, diogenes, la, rtius, also, records, that, works, supposedly, written, by, theano, were, still, extant, during, his, own, lifetime, and, quotes, several, opinions, attributed, to, her, these, writings, are, now, known, to, be, pseudepigraphical, pythagoras, s, emphasis, on, dedication, and, asceticism, are, credited, with, aiding, in, croton, s, decisive, victory, over, the, neighboring, colony, of, sybaris, in, 510, bc, after, the, victory, some, prominent, citizens, of, croton, proposed, a, democratic, constitution, which, the, pythagoreans, rejected, the, supporters, of, democracy, headed, by, cylon, and, ninon, the, former, of, whom, is, said, to, have, been, irritated, by, his, exclusion, from, pythagoras, s, brotherhood, roused, the, populace, against, them, followers, of, cylon, and, ninon, attacked, the, pythagoreans, during, one, of, their, meetings, either, in, the, house, of, milo, or, in, some, other, meeting, place, accounts, of, the, attack, are, often, contradictory, and, many, probably, confused, it, with, the, later, anti, pythagorean, rebellions, such, as, the, one, in, metapontum, in, 454, bc, the, building, was, apparently, set, on, fire, and, many, of, the, assembled, members, perished, only, the, younger, and, more, active, members, managed, to, escape, sources, disagree, regarding, whether, pythagoras, was, present, when, the, attack, occurred, and, if, he, was, whether, or, not, he, managed, to, escape, in, some, accounts, pythagoras, was, not, at, the, meeting, when, the, pythagoreans, were, attacked, because, he, was, on, delos, tending, to, the, dying, pherecydes, according, to, another, account, from, dicaearchus, pythagoras, was, at, the, meeting, and, managed, to, escape, leading, a, small, group, of, followers, to, the, nearby, city, of, locris, where, they, pleaded, for, sanctuary, but, were, denied, they, reached, the, city, of, metapontum, where, they, took, shelter, in, the, temple, of, the, muses, and, died, there, of, starvation, after, forty, days, without, food, another, tale, recorded, by, porphyry, claims, that, as, pythagoras, s, enemies, were, burning, the, house, his, devoted, students, laid, down, on, the, ground, to, make, a, path, for, him, to, escape, by, walking, over, their, bodies, across, the, flames, like, a, bridge, pythagoras, managed, to, escape, but, was, so, despondent, at, the, deaths, of, his, beloved, students, that, he, committed, suicide, a, different, legend, reported, by, both, diogenes, la, rtius, and, iamblichus, states, that, pythagoras, almost, managed, to, escape, but, that, he, came, to, a, fava, bean, field, and, refused, to, run, through, it, since, doing, so, would, violate, his, teachings, so, he, stopped, instead, and, was, killed, this, story, seems, to, have, originated, from, the, writer, neanthes, who, told, it, about, later, pythagoreans, not, about, pythagoras, himself, although, the, exact, details, of, pythagoras, s, teachings, are, uncertain, it, is, possible, to, reconstruct, a, general, outline, of, his, main, ideas, aristotle, writes, at, length, about, the, teachings, of, the, pythagoreans, but, without, mentioning, pythagoras, directly, one, of, pythagoras, s, main, doctrines, appears, to, have, been, metempsychosis, the, belief, that, all, souls, are, immortal, and, that, after, death, a, soul, is, transferred, into, a, new, body, this, teaching, is, referenced, by, xenophanes, ion, of, chios, and, herodotus, nothing, whatsoever, however, is, known, about, the, nature, or, mechanism, by, which, pythagoras, believed, metempsychosis, to, occur, empedocles, alludes, in, one, of, his, poems, that, pythagoras, may, have, claimed, to, possess, the, ability, to, recall, his, former, incarnations, diogenes, la, rtius, reports, an, account, from, heraclides, ponticus, that, pythagoras, told, people, that, he, had, lived, four, previous, lives, that, he, could, remember, in, detail, the, first, of, these, lives, was, as, aethalides, the, son, of, hermes, who, granted, him, the, ability, to, remember, all, his, past, incarnations, next, he, was, incarnated, as, euphorbus, a, minor, hero, from, the, trojan, war, briefly, mentioned, in, the, iliad, he, then, became, the, philosopher, hermotimus, who, recognized, the, shield, of, euphorbus, in, the, temple, of, apollo, his, final, incarnation, was, as, pyrrhus, a, fisherman, from, delos, one, of, his, past, lives, as, reported, by, dicaearchus, was, as, a, beautiful, courtesan, another, belief, attributed, to, pythagoras, was, that, of, the, harmony, of, the, spheres, which, maintained, that, the, planets, and, stars, move, according, to, mathematical, equations, which, correspond, to, musical, notes, and, thus, produce, an, inaudible, symphony, according, to, porphyry, pythagoras, taught, that, the, seven, muses, were, actually, the, seven, planets, singing, together, in, his, philosophical, dialogue, protrepticus, aristotle, has, his, literary, double, say, when, pythagoras, was, asked, he, said, to, observe, the, heavens, and, he, used, to, claim, that, he, himself, was, an, observer, of, nature, and, it, was, for, the, sake, of, this, that, he, had, passed, over, into, life, pythagoras, was, said, to, have, practiced, divination, and, prophecy, the, earliest, mentions, of, divination, by, isopsephy, in, greek, literature, associate, it, with, pythagoras, he, was, viewed, as, the, founder, of, this, practice, according, to, his, biographer, iamblichus, he, taught, his, method, of, divination, to, a, scythian, priest, of, apollo, by, the, name, of, abaris, the, hyperborean, abaris, stayed, with, pythagoras, and, was, compendiously, taught, physiology, and, theology, and, instead, of, divining, by, the, entrails, of, beasts, he, revealed, to, him, the, art, of, prognosticating, by, numbers, conceiving, this, to, be, a, method, purer, more, divine, and, more, kindred, to, the, celestial, numbers, of, the, gods, this, shouldn, t, be, confused, with, a, simplified, version, known, today, as, pythagorean, numerology, involving, a, variant, of, an, isopsephic, technique, known, among, other, names, as, pythmenes, roots, or, base, numbers, by, means, of, which, the, base, values, of, letters, in, a, word, were, mathematically, reduced, by, addition, or, division, in, order, to, obtain, a, single, value, from, one, to, nine, for, the, whole, name, or, word, these, roots, or, base, numbers, could, then, be, interpreted, with, other, techniques, such, as, traditional, pythagorean, attributions, this, latter, form, of, numerology, flourished, during, the, byzantine, era, and, was, first, attested, among, the, gnostics, of, the, second, century, ad, by, that, time, isopsephy, had, developed, into, several, different, techniques, that, were, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, including, divination, doctrinal, allegory, and, medical, prognosis, and, treatment, in, the, visits, to, various, places, in, greece, delos, sparta, phlius, crete, etc, which, are, ascribed, to, him, he, usually, appears, either, in, his, religious, or, priestly, guise, or, else, as, a, lawgiver, the, so, called, pythagoreans, applied, themselves, to, mathematics, and, were, the, first, to, develop, this, science, and, through, studying, it, they, came, to, believe, that, its, principles, are, the, principles, of, everything, according, to, aristotle, the, pythagoreans, used, mathematics, for, solely, mystical, reasons, devoid, of, practical, application, they, believed, that, all, things, were, made, of, numbers, the, number, one, the, monad, represented, the, origin, of, all, things, and, the, number, two, the, dyad, represented, matter, the, number, three, was, an, ideal, number, because, it, had, a, beginning, middle, and, end, and, was, the, smallest, number, of, points, that, could, be, used, to, define, a, plane, triangle, which, they, revered, as, a, symbol, of, the, god, apollo, the, number, four, signified, the, four, seasons, and, the, four, elements, the, number, seven, was, also, sacred, because, it, was, the, number, of, planets, and, the, number, of, strings, on, a, lyre, and, because, apollo, s, birthday, was, celebrated, on, the, seventh, day, of, each, month, they, believed, that, odd, numbers, were, masculine, that, even, numbers, were, feminine, and, that, the, number, five, represented, marriage, because, it, was, the, sum, of, two, and, three, ten, was, regarded, as, the, perfect, number, and, the, pythagoreans, honored, it, by, never, gathering, in, groups, larger, than, ten, pythagoras, was, credited, with, devising, the, tetractys, the, triangular, figure, of, four, rows, which, add, up, to, the, perfect, number, ten, the, pythagoreans, regarded, the, tetractys, as, a, symbol, of, utmost, mystical, importance, iamblichus, in, his, life, of, pythagoras, states, that, the, tetractys, was, so, admirable, and, so, divinised, by, those, who, understood, that, pythagoras, s, students, would, swear, oaths, by, it, andrew, gregory, concludes, that, the, tradition, linking, pythagoras, to, the, tetractys, is, probably, genuine, modern, scholars, debate, whether, these, numerological, teachings, were, developed, by, pythagoras, himself, or, by, the, later, pythagorean, philosopher, philolaus, of, croton, in, his, landmark, study, lore, and, science, in, ancient, pythagoreanism, walter, burkert, argues, that, pythagoras, was, a, charismatic, political, and, religious, teacher, but, that, the, number, philosophy, attributed, to, him, was, really, an, innovation, by, philolaus, according, to, burkert, pythagoras, never, dealt, with, numbers, at, all, let, alone, made, any, noteworthy, contribution, to, mathematics, burkert, argues, that, the, only, mathematics, the, pythagoreans, ever, actually, engaged, in, was, simple, proofless, arithmetic, but, that, these, arithmetic, discoveries, did, contribute, significantly, to, the, beginnings, of, mathematics, both, plato, and, isocrates, state, that, above, all, else, pythagoras, was, known, as, the, founder, of, a, new, way, of, life, the, organization, pythagoras, founded, at, croton, was, called, a, school, but, in, many, ways, resembled, a, monastery, the, adherents, were, bound, by, a, vow, to, pythagoras, and, each, other, for, the, purpose, of, pursuing, the, religious, and, ascetic, observances, and, of, studying, his, religious, and, philosophical, theories, the, members, of, the, sect, shared, all, their, possessions, in, common, and, were, devoted, to, each, other, to, the, exclusion, of, outsiders, ancient, sources, record, that, the, pythagoreans, ate, meals, in, common, after, the, manner, of, the, spartans, one, pythagorean, maxim, was, koin, t, ph, l, n, all, things, in, common, among, friends, both, iamblichus, and, porphyry, provide, detailed, accounts, of, the, organization, of, the, school, although, the, primary, interest, of, both, writers, is, not, historical, accuracy, but, rather, to, present, pythagoras, as, a, divine, figure, sent, by, the, gods, to, benefit, humankind, iamblichus, in, particular, presents, the, pythagorean, way, of, life, as, a, pagan, alternative, to, the, christian, monastic, communities, of, his, own, time, for, pythagoreans, the, highest, reward, a, human, could, attain, was, for, their, soul, to, join, in, the, life, of, the, gods, and, thus, escape, the, cycle, of, reincarnation, two, groups, existed, within, early, pythagoreanism, the, mathematikoi, learners, and, the, akousmatikoi, listeners, the, akousmatikoi, are, traditionally, identified, by, scholars, as, old, believers, in, mysticism, numerology, and, religious, teachings, whereas, the, mathematikoi, are, traditionally, identified, as, a, more, intellectual, modernist, faction, who, were, more, rationalist, and, scientific, gregory, cautions, that, there, was, probably, not, a, sharp, distinction, between, them, and, that, many, pythagoreans, probably, believed, the, two, approaches, were, compatible, the, study, of, mathematics, and, music, may, have, been, connected, to, the, worship, of, apollo, the, pythagoreans, believed, that, music, was, a, purification, for, the, soul, just, as, medicine, was, a, purification, for, the, body, one, anecdote, of, pythagoras, reports, that, when, he, encountered, some, drunken, youths, trying, to, break, into, the, home, of, a, virtuous, woman, he, sang, a, solemn, tune, with, long, spondees, and, the, boys, raging, willfulness, was, quelled, the, pythagoreans, also, placed, particular, emphasis, on, the, importance, of, physical, exercise, therapeutic, dancing, daily, morning, walks, along, scenic, routes, and, athletics, were, major, components, of, the, pythagorean, lifestyle, moments, of, contemplation, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, each, day, were, also, advised, pythagorean, teachings, were, known, as, symbols, symbola, and, members, took, a, vow, of, silence, that, they, would, not, reveal, these, symbols, to, non, members, those, who, did, not, obey, the, laws, of, the, community, were, expelled, and, the, remaining, members, would, erect, tombstones, for, them, as, though, they, had, died, a, number, of, oral, sayings, ako, smata, attributed, to, pythagoras, have, survived, dealing, with, how, members, of, the, pythagorean, community, should, perform, sacrifices, how, they, should, honor, the, gods, how, they, should, move, from, here, and, how, they, should, be, buried, many, of, these, sayings, emphasize, the, importance, of, ritual, purity, and, avoiding, defilement, for, instance, a, saying, which, leonid, zhmud, concludes, can, probably, be, genuinely, traced, back, to, pythagoras, himself, forbids, his, followers, from, wearing, woolen, garments, other, extant, oral, sayings, forbid, pythagoreans, from, breaking, bread, poking, fires, with, swords, or, picking, up, crumbs, and, teach, that, a, person, should, always, put, the, right, sandal, on, before, the, left, the, exact, meanings, of, these, sayings, however, are, frequently, obscure, iamblichus, preserves, aristotle, s, descriptions, of, the, original, ritualistic, intentions, behind, a, few, of, these, sayings, but, these, apparently, later, fell, out, of, fashion, because, porphyry, provides, markedly, different, ethical, philosophical, interpretations, of, them, new, initiates, were, allegedly, not, permitted, to, meet, pythagoras, until, after, they, had, completed, a, five, year, initiation, period, during, which, they, were, required, to, remain, silent, sources, indicate, that, pythagoras, himself, was, unusually, progressive, in, his, attitudes, towards, women, and, female, members, of, pythagoras, s, school, appear, to, have, played, an, active, role, in, its, operations, iamblichus, provides, a, list, of, 235, famous, pythagoreans, seventeen, of, whom, are, women, in, later, times, many, prominent, female, philosophers, contributed, to, the, development, of, neopythagoreanism, pythagoreanism, also, entailed, a, number, of, dietary, prohibitions, it, is, more, or, less, agreed, that, pythagoras, issued, a, prohibition, against, the, consumption, of, fava, beans, and, the, meat, of, non, sacrificial, animals, such, as, fish, and, poultry, both, of, these, assumptions, however, have, been, contradicted, pythagorean, dietary, restrictions, may, have, been, motivated, by, belief, in, the, doctrine, of, metempsychosis, some, ancient, writers, present, pythagoras, as, enforcing, a, strictly, vegetarian, diet, eudoxus, of, cnidus, a, student, of, archytas, writes, pythagoras, was, distinguished, by, such, purity, and, so, avoided, killing, and, killers, that, he, not, only, abstained, from, animal, foods, but, even, kept, his, distance, from, cooks, and, hunters, other, authorities, contradict, this, statement, according, to, aristoxenus, pythagoras, allowed, the, use, of, all, kinds, of, animal, food, except, the, flesh, of, oxen, used, for, ploughing, and, rams, according, to, heraclides, ponticus, pythagoras, ate, the, meat, from, sacrifices, and, established, a, diet, for, athletes, dependent, on, meat, within, his, own, lifetime, pythagoras, was, already, the, subject, of, elaborate, hagiographic, legends, aristotle, described, pythagoras, as, a, wonder, worker, and, somewhat, of, a, supernatural, figure, in, a, fragment, aristotle, writes, that, pythagoras, had, a, golden, thigh, which, he, publicly, exhibited, at, the, olympic, games, and, showed, to, abaris, the, hyperborean, as, proof, of, his, identity, as, the, hyperborean, apollo, supposedly, the, priest, of, apollo, gave, pythagoras, a, magic, arrow, which, he, used, to, fly, over, long, distances, and, perform, ritual, purifications, he, was, supposedly, once, seen, at, both, metapontum, and, croton, at, the, same, time, when, pythagoras, crossed, the, river, kosas, the, modern, day, basento, several, witnesses, reported, that, they, heard, it, greet, him, by, name, in, roman, times, a, legend, claimed, that, pythagoras, was, the, son, of, apollo, according, to, muslim, tradition, pythagoras, was, said, to, have, been, initiated, by, hermes, egyptian, thoth, pythagoras, was, said, to, have, dressed, all, in, white, he, is, also, said, to, have, borne, a, golden, wreath, atop, his, head, and, to, have, worn, trousers, after, the, fashion, of, the, thracians, diogenes, la, rtius, presents, pythagoras, as, having, exercised, remarkable, self, control, he, was, always, cheerful, but, abstained, wholly, from, laughter, and, from, all, such, indulgences, as, jests, and, idle, stories, pythagoras, was, said, to, have, had, extraordinary, success, in, dealing, with, animals, a, fragment, from, aristotle, records, that, when, a, deadly, snake, bit, pythagoras, he, bit, it, back, and, killed, it, both, porphyry, and, iamblichus, report, that, pythagoras, once, persuaded, a, bull, not, to, eat, fava, beans, and, that, he, once, convinced, a, notoriously, destructive, bear, to, swear, that, it, would, never, harm, a, living, thing, again, and, that, the, bear, kept, its, word, riedweg, suggests, that, pythagoras, may, have, personally, encouraged, these, legends, but, gregory, states, that, there, is, no, direct, evidence, of, this, anti, pythagorean, legends, were, also, circulated, diogenes, la, rtes, retells, a, story, told, by, hermippus, of, samos, which, states, that, pythagoras, had, once, gone, into, an, underground, room, telling, everyone, that, he, was, descending, to, the, underworld, he, stayed, in, this, room, for, months, while, his, mother, secretly, recorded, everything, that, happened, during, his, absence, after, he, returned, from, this, room, pythagoras, recounted, everything, that, had, happened, while, he, was, gone, convincing, everyone, that, he, had, really, been, in, the, underworld, and, leading, them, to, trust, him, with, their, wives, although, pythagoras, is, most, famous, today, for, his, alleged, mathematical, discoveries, classical, historians, dispute, whether, he, himself, ever, actually, made, any, significant, contributions, to, the, field, many, mathematical, and, scientific, discoveries, were, attributed, to, pythagoras, including, his, famous, theorem, as, well, as, discoveries, in, the, fields, of, music, astronomy, and, medicine, since, at, least, the, first, century, bc, pythagoras, has, commonly, been, given, credit, for, discovering, the, pythagorean, theorem, a, theorem, in, geometry, that, states, that, in, a, right, angled, triangle, the, square, of, the, hypotenuse, is, equal, the, squares, of, the, two, other, sides, that, is, a, 2, b, 2, c, 2, displaystyle, a, 2, b, 2, c, 2, according, to, a, popular, legend, after, he, discovered, this, theorem, pythagoras, sacrificed, an, ox, or, possibly, even, a, whole, hecatomb, to, the, gods, cicero, rejected, this, story, as, spurious, because, of, the, much, more, widely, held, belief, that, pythagoras, forbade, blood, sacrifices, porphyry, attempted, to, explain, the, story, by, asserting, that, the, ox, was, actually, made, of, dough, the, pythagorean, theorem, was, known, and, used, by, the, babylonians, and, indians, centuries, before, pythagoras, but, he, may, have, been, the, first, to, introduce, it, to, the, greeks, some, historians, of, mathematics, have, even, suggested, that, he, or, his, students, may, have, constructed, the, first, proof, burkert, rejects, this, suggestion, as, implausible, noting, that, pythagoras, was, never, credited, with, having, proved, any, theorem, in, antiquity, furthermore, the, manner, in, which, the, babylonians, employed, pythagorean, numbers, implies, that, they, knew, that, the, principle, was, generally, applicable, and, knew, some, kind, of, proof, which, has, not, yet, been, found, in, the, still, largely, unpublished, cuneiform, sources, pythagoras, s, biographers, state, that, he, also, was, the, first, to, identify, the, five, regular, solids, and, that, he, was, the, first, to, discover, the, theory, of, proportions, according, to, legend, pythagoras, discovered, that, musical, notes, could, be, translated, into, mathematical, equations, when, he, passed, blacksmiths, at, work, one, day, and, heard, the, sound, of, their, hammers, clanging, against, the, anvils, thinking, that, the, sounds, of, the, hammers, were, beautiful, and, harmonious, except, for, one, he, rushed, into, the, blacksmith, shop, and, began, testing, the, hammers, he, then, realized, that, the, tune, played, when, the, hammer, struck, was, directly, proportional, to, the, size, of, the, hammer, and, therefore, concluded, that, music, was, mathematical, in, ancient, times, pythagoras, and, his, contemporary, parmenides, of, elea, were, both, credited, with, having, been, the, first, to, teach, that, the, earth, was, spherical, the, first, to, divide, the, globe, into, five, climatic, zones, and, the, first, to, identify, the, morning, star, and, the, evening, star, as, the, same, celestial, object, now, known, as, venus, of, the, two, philosophers, parmenides, has, a, much, stronger, claim, to, having, been, the, first, and, the, attribution, of, these, discoveries, to, pythagoras, seems, to, have, possibly, originated, from, a, pseudepigraphal, poem, empedocles, who, lived, in, magna, graecia, shortly, after, pythagoras, and, parmenides, knew, that, the, earth, was, spherical, by, the, end, of, the, fifth, century, bc, this, fact, was, universally, accepted, among, greek, intellectuals, the, identity, of, the, morning, star, and, evening, star, was, known, to, the, babylonians, over, a, thousand, years, earlier, sizeable, pythagorean, communities, existed, in, magna, graecia, phlius, and, thebes, during, the, early, fourth, century, bc, around, the, same, time, the, pythagorean, philosopher, archytas, was, highly, influential, on, the, politics, of, the, city, of, tarentum, in, magna, graecia, according, to, later, tradition, archytas, was, elected, as, strategos, general, seven, times, even, though, others, were, prohibited, from, serving, more, than, a, year, archytas, was, also, a, renowned, mathematician, and, musician, he, was, a, close, friend, of, plato, and, he, is, quoted, in, plato, s, republic, aristotle, states, that, the, philosophy, of, plato, was, heavily, dependent, on, the, teachings, of, the, pythagoreans, cicero, repeats, this, statement, remarking, that, platonem, ferunt, didicisse, pythagorea, omnia, they, say, plato, learned, all, things, pythagorean, according, to, charles, h, kahn, plato, s, middle, dialogues, including, meno, phaedo, and, the, republic, have, a, strong, pythagorean, coloring, and, his, last, few, dialogues, particularly, philebus, and, timaeus, are, extremely, pythagorean, in, character, according, to, r, m, hare, plato, s, republic, may, be, partially, based, on, the, tightly, organised, community, of, like, minded, thinkers, established, by, pythagoras, at, croton, additionally, plato, may, have, borrowed, from, pythagoras, the, idea, that, mathematics, and, abstract, thought, are, a, secure, basis, for, philosophy, science, and, morality, plato, and, pythagoras, shared, a, mystical, approach, to, the, soul, and, its, place, in, the, material, world, and, both, were, probably, influenced, by, orphism, the, historian, of, philosophy, frederick, copleston, states, that, plato, probably, borrowed, his, tripartite, theory, of, the, soul, from, the, pythagoreans, bertrand, russell, in, his, a, history, of, western, philosophy, contends, that, the, influence, of, pythagoras, on, plato, and, others, was, so, great, that, he, should, be, considered, the, most, influential, philosopher, of, all, time, he, concludes, that, i, do, not, know, of, any, other, man, who, has, been, as, influential, as, he, was, in, the, school, of, thought, a, revival, of, pythagorean, teachings, occurred, in, the, first, century, bc, when, middle, platonist, philosophers, such, as, eudorus, and, philo, of, alexandria, hailed, the, rise, of, a, new, pythagoreanism, in, alexandria, at, around, the, same, time, neopythagoreanism, became, prominent, the, first, century, ad, philosopher, apollonius, of, tyana, sought, to, emulate, pythagoras, and, live, by, pythagorean, teachings, the, later, first, century, neopythagorean, philosopher, moderatus, of, gades, expanded, on, pythagorean, number, philosophy, and, probably, understood, the, soul, as, a, kind, of, mathematical, harmony, the, neopythagorean, mathematician, and, musicologist, nicomachus, likewise, expanded, on, pythagorean, numerology, and, music, theory, numenius, of, apamea, interpreted, plato, s, teachings, in, light, of, pythagorean, doctrines, greek, sculpture, sought, to, represent, the, permanent, reality, behind, superficial, appearances, early, archaic, sculpture, represents, life, in, simple, forms, and, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, earliest, greek, natural, philosophies, the, greeks, generally, believed, that, nature, expressed, itself, in, ideal, forms, and, was, represented, by, a, type, which, was, mathematically, calculated, when, dimensions, changed, architects, sought, to, relay, permanence, through, mathematics, maurice, bowra, believes, that, these, ideas, influenced, the, theory, of, pythagoras, and, his, students, who, believed, that, all, things, are, numbers, during, the, sixth, century, bc, the, number, philosophy, of, the, pythagoreans, triggered, a, revolution, in, greek, sculpture, greek, sculptors, and, architects, attempted, to, find, the, mathematical, relation, canon, behind, aesthetic, perfection, possibly, drawing, on, the, ideas, of, pythagoras, the, sculptor, polykleitos, wrote, in, his, canon, that, beauty, consists, in, the, proportion, not, of, the, elements, materials, but, of, the, interrelation, of, parts, with, one, another, and, with, the, whole, in, the, greek, architectural, orders, every, element, was, calculated, and, constructed, by, mathematical, relations, rhys, carpenter, states, that, the, ratio, 2, 1, was, the, generative, ratio, of, the, doric, order, and, in, hellenistic, times, an, ordinary, doric, colonnade, beats, out, a, rhythm, of, notes, the, oldest, known, building, designed, according, to, pythagorean, teachings, is, the, porta, maggiore, basilica, a, subterranean, basilica, which, was, built, during, the, reign, of, the, roman, emperor, nero, as, a, secret, place, of, worship, for, pythagoreans, the, basilica, was, built, underground, because, of, the, pythagorean, emphasis, on, secrecy, and, also, because, of, the, legend, that, pythagoras, had, sequestered, himself, in, a, cave, on, samos, the, basilica, s, apse, is, in, the, east, and, its, atrium, in, the, west, out, of, respect, for, the, rising, sun, it, has, a, narrow, entrance, leading, to, a, small, pool, where, the, initiates, could, purify, themselves, the, building, is, also, designed, according, to, pythagorean, numerology, with, each, table, in, the, sanctuary, providing, seats, for, seven, people, three, aisles, lead, to, a, single, altar, symbolizing, the, three, parts, of, the, soul, approaching, the, unity, of, apollo, the, apse, depicts, a, scene, of, the, poet, sappho, leaping, off, the, leucadian, cliffs, clutching, her, lyre, to, her, breast, while, apollo, stands, beneath, her, extending, his, right, hand, in, a, gesture, of, protection, symbolizing, pythagorean, teachings, about, the, immortality, of, the, soul, the, interior, of, the, sanctuary, is, almost, entirely, white, because, the, color, white, was, regarded, by, pythagoreans, as, sacred, the, emperor, hadrian, s, pantheon, in, rome, was, also, built, based, on, pythagorean, numerology, the, temple, s, circular, plan, central, axis, hemispherical, dome, and, alignment, with, the, four, cardinal, directions, symbolize, pythagorean, views, on, the, order, of, the, universe, the, single, oculus, at, the, top, of, the, dome, symbolizes, the, monad, and, the, sun, god, apollo, the, twenty, eight, ribs, extending, from, the, oculus, symbolize, the, moon, because, twenty, eight, was, the, same, number, of, months, on, the, pythagorean, lunar, calendar, the, five, coffered, rings, beneath, the, ribs, represent, the, marriage, of, the, sun, and, moon, many, early, christians, had, a, deep, respect, for, pythagoras, eusebius, c, 260, c, 340, ad, bishop, of, caesarea, praises, pythagoras, in, his, against, hierokles, for, his, rule, of, silence, his, frugality, his, extraordinary, morality, and, his, wise, teachings, in, another, work, eusebius, compares, pythagoras, to, moses, in, one, of, his, letters, the, church, father, jerome, c, 347, c, 420, ad, praises, pythagoras, for, his, wisdom, and, in, another, letter, he, credits, pythagoras, for, his, belief, in, the, immortality, of, the, soul, which, he, suggests, christians, inherited, from, him, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, ad, rejected, pythagoras, s, teaching, of, metempsychosis, without, explicitly, naming, him, but, otherwise, expressed, admiration, for, him, in, on, the, trinity, augustine, lauds, the, fact, that, pythagoras, was, humble, enough, to, call, himself, a, philosophos, or, lover, of, wisdom, rather, than, a, sage, in, another, passage, augustine, defends, pythagoras, s, reputation, arguing, that, pythagoras, certainly, never, taught, the, doctrine, of, metempsychosis, during, the, middle, ages, pythagoras, was, revered, as, the, founder, of, mathematics, and, music, two, of, the, seven, liberal, arts, he, appears, in, numerous, medieval, depictions, in, illuminated, manuscripts, and, in, the, relief, sculptures, on, the, portal, of, the, cathedral, of, chartres, the, timaeus, was, the, only, dialogue, of, plato, to, survive, in, latin, translation, in, western, europe, which, led, william, of, conches, c, 1080, 1160, to, declare, that, plato, was, pythagorean, a, large, scale, translation, movement, emerged, during, the, abbasid, caliphate, translating, many, greek, texts,
