press, garbo, s, performance, was, well, received, garbo, s, success, in, her, first, american, film, led, thalberg, to, cast, her, in, a, similar, role, in, the, temptress, 1926, based, on, another, ib, ez, novel, in, this, her, second, film, she, played, opposite, the, popular, star, antonio, moreno, but, was, given, top, billing, her, mentor, stiller, who, had, persuaded, her, to, take, the, part, was, assigned, to, direct, for, both, garbo, who, did, not, want, to, play, another, vamp, and, did, not, like, the, script, any, more, than, she, did, the, first, one, and, stiller, the, temptress, was, a, harrowing, experience, stiller, who, spoke, little, english, had, difficulty, adapting, to, the, studio, system, and, did, not, get, on, with, moreno, was, fired, by, thalberg, and,

of, her, scenes, she, prohibited, visitors, including, the, studio, brass, from, her, sets, and, demanded, that, black, flats, or, screens, surround, her, to, prevent, extras, and, technicians, from, watching, her, when, asked, about, these, eccentric, requirements, she, said, if, i, am, by, myself, my, face, will, do, things, i, cannot, do, with, it, otherwise, despite, her, status, as, a, star, of, silent, films, the, studio, feared, that, her, swedish, accent, might, impair, her, work, in, sound, and, delayed, the, shift, for, as, long, as, possible, mgm, itself, was, the, last, hollywood, studio, to, convert, to, sound, and, garbo, s, last, silent, film, the, kiss, 1929, was, also, the, studio, s, despite, the, fears, garbo, became, one, of, the, biggest, box, office, draws, of, the,

did, not, match, garbo, s, success, with, her, sound, debut, she, was, ranked, as, the, most, popular, female, star, in, the, united, states, in, 1930, and, 1931, garbo, followed, with, two, of, her,

to, portray, joan, of, arc, but, mgm, rebuffed, the, idea, and, the, project, was, shelved, by, this, time, she, had, a, fanatical, worldwide, following, and, the, phenomenon, of, garbomania, reached, its, peak, after, appearing, in, as, you, desire, me, 1932, the, first, of, three, films, in, which, garbo, starred, opposite, melvyn, douglas, her, mgm, contract, expired, and, she, returned, to,

star, although, her, domestic, popularity, was, undiminished, in, the, early, 1930s, high, profits, for, garbo, s, films, after, queen, christina, depended, on, the, foreign, market, for, their, success, the, type, of, historical, and, melodramatic, films, she, began, to, make, on, the, advice, of, viertel, were, highly, successful, abroad, but, considerably, less, so, in, the, united,

camille, 1936, as, her, next, project, thalberg, cast, her, opposite, robert, taylor, and, former, co, star, lionel, barrymore, cukor, carefully, crafted, garbo, s, portrayal, of, marguerite, gautier, a, lower, class, woman, who, becomes, the, world, renowned, mistress, camille, production, was, marred, however, by, the, sudden, death, of, thalberg, then, only, thirty, seven, which, plunged, the, hollywood, studios, into, a, state, of, profound, shock, writes, david, bret, 272, garbo, had, grown, close, to, thalberg, and, his, wife, norma, shearer, and, had, often, dropped, by, their, house, unannounced, her, grief, for, thalberg, some, believe, was, more, profound, than, for, john, gilbert, who, died, earlier, that, same, year, 272, his, death, also, added, to, the, sombre, mood, required, for, the, closing, scenes, of, camille, when, the, film, premiered, in, new, york, on, 12, december, 1936, it, became, an, international, success, garbo, s, first, major, success, in, three,

its, failure, said, people, often, glibly, say, that, the, failure, of, two, faced, woman, finished, garbo, s, career, that, s, a, grotesque, over, simplification, it, certainly, threw, her, but, i, think, that, what, really, happened, was, that, she, just, gave, up, she, didn, t, want, to, go, on, still, garbo, signed, a, contract, in, 1948, with, producer, walter, wanger, who, had, produced,

garbo, stepped, in, front, of, a, movie, camera, were, thought, to, have, been, lost, for, 41, years, until, they, were, re, discovered, in, 1990, by, film, historians, leonard, maltin, and, jeanine, basinger, parts, of, the, footage, were, included, in, the, 2005, tcm, documentary, garbo, in, 1949, she, was, offered, the, role, of, fictional, silent, film, star, norma, desmond, in, sunset,

whatsoever, she, was, offered, many, roles, both, in, the, 1940s, and, throughout, her, retirement, years, but, rejected, all, but, a, few, of, them, in, the, few, instances, when, she, did, accept, them, the, slightest, problem, led, her, to, drop, out, although, she, refused, throughout, her, life, to, talk, to, friends, about, her, reasons, for, retiring, four, years, before, her, death, she, told, swedish, biographer, sven, broman, i, was, tired, of, hollywood, i, did, not, like, my, work, there, were, many, days, when, i, had, to, force, myself, to, go, to, the, studio, i, really, wanted, to, live, another, life, from, the, early, days, of, her, career, garbo, avoided, industry, social, functions, preferring, to, spend, her, time, alone, or, with, friends, she, never, signed, autographs, or, answered, fan, mail, and, rarely, gave, interviews, nor, did, she, ever, appear, at, oscar, ceremonies, even, when, she, was, nominated, her, aversion, to, publicity, and, the, press, was, undeniably, genuine, and, exasperating, to, the, studio, at, first, in, an, interview, in, 1928, she, explained, that, her, desire, for, privacy, began, when, she, was, a, child, stating, as, early, as, i, can, remember, i, have, wanted, to, be, alone, i, ve, always, been, moody, i, detest, crowds, i, don, t, like, many, people, the, artist, james, montgomery, flagg, said, in, 1933, that, when, he, was, allowed, to, sketch, garbo, at, a, director, s, party, in, hollywood, some, years, earlier, she, told, him, she, suffered, from, melancholia, at, that, time, she, had, a, swedish, phonograph, record, of, laughs, of, all, kinds, which, she, played, when, visiting, to, observe, her, hosts, response, in, 1937, in, a, letter, to, her, friend, austrian, actress, and, writer, salka, viertel, she, wrote, i, go, nowhere, see, no, one, it, is, hard, and, sad, to, be, alone, but, sometimes, it, s, even, more, difficult, to, be, with, someone, in, another, letter, in, 1970, she, wrote, i, feel, very, tired, and, cannot, seem, to, get, myself, together, to, plan, where, to, go, i, am, sorry, but, something, always, seem, to, go, a, little, wrong, with, me, and, it, is, not, in, my, head, either, because, garbo, was, suspicious, and, mistrustful, of, the, media, and, often, at, odds, with, mgm, executives, she, spurned, hollywood, s, publicity, rules, she, was, routinely, referred, to, by, the, press, as, the, swedish, sphinx, her, reticence, and, fear, of, strangers, perpetuated, the, mystery, and, mystique, she, projected, both, on, screen, and, in, real, life, mgm, eventually, capitalized, on, it, for, it, bolstered, the, image, of, the, silent, and, reclusive, woman, of, mystery, in, spite, of, her, strenuous, efforts, to, avoid, publicity, garbo,

whom, she, socialized, and, travelled, although, it, has, also, been, said, that, in, later, years, she, did, not, trust, many, people, and, therefore, did, not, have, many, close, friends, her,

call, it, underplaying, but, in, underplaying, she, overplayed, everyone, else, many, critics, have, said, that, few, of, garbo, s, 24, hollywood, films, are, artistically, exceptional, and, that, many, are, simply, bad, it, has, been, said, however, that, her, commanding, and, magnetic, performances, usually, overcome, the, weaknesses, of, plot, and, dialogue, as, one, biographer, put, it,

she, shared, her, emotions, with, the, camera, and, the, audience, they, were, very, truthful, emotions, to, my, mind, she, was, an, early, practitioner, of, the, method, she, felt, everything, she, did, and, had, the, intelligence, to, go, with, it, and, that, is, the, key, for, the, audience, if, they, believe, it, then, they, ve, spent, a, couple, of, good, hours, at, the, cinema, american,

to, your, bed, at, night, and, is, so, kind, and, lovely, he, could, remember, garbo, still, maybe, it, was, like, those, dreams, the, night, before, the, attack, on, pozoblanco, and, was, wearing, a, soft, silky, wool, sweater, when, he, put, his, arms, around, her, and, when, she, leaned, forward, and, her, hair, swept, forward, and, over, his, face, and, she, said, why, had, he, never, told,
