allowing, for, some, difference, of, education, the, liberality, of, conduct, and, political, views, which, were, sometimes, exhibited, by, old, hyder, ali, yet, i, did, think, he, might, have, shown, the, same, resolved, and, dogged, spirit, of, resolution, which, induced, tipu, sahib, to, die, manfully, upon, the, breach, of, his, capital, city, with, his, sabre, clenched, in, his, hand, horatio,

as, 5, 000, rocketeers, at, a, time, the, rockets, deployed, by, tipu, during, the, battle, of, pollilur, were, much, more, advanced, than, those, the, british, east, india, company, had, previously, seen, chiefly, because, of, the, use, of, iron, tubes, for, holding, the, propellant, this, enabled, higher, thrust, and, longer, range, for, the, missiles, up, to, 2, km, range, british, accounts, describe, the, use, of, the, rockets, during, the, third, and, fourth, wars, during, the, climactic, battle, at, srirangapatna, in, 1799, british, shells, struck, a, magazine, containing, rockets,

war, the, british, captured, a, number, of, the, mysorean, rockets, these, became, influential, in, british, rocket, development, inspiring, the, congreve, rocket, which, was, soon, put, into, use, in, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1786, tipu, sultan, again, following, the, lead, of, his, father, decided, to, build, a, navy, consisting, of, 20, battleships, of, 72, cannons, and, 20, frigates, of, 65, cannons, in, the, year, 1790, he, appointed, kamaluddin, as, his, mir, bahar, and, established, massive, dockyards, at, jamalabad, and, majidabad, tipu, sultan, s, board, of, admiralty, consisted,

that, increased, the, longevity, of, the, ships, and, was, introduced, to, tipu, by, admiral, suffren, due, to, their, perpetual, battle, engagements, haidar, and, tipu, required, a, disciplined, standing, army, thus, rajputs, muslims, and, able, tribal, men, were, enrolled, for, full, time, service, replacing, the, local, militia, called, the, kandachar, force, of, agricultural, origin, which, existed, in, the, mysore, army, earlier, the, removal, of, the, vokkaligas, from, the, local, militia, which, had, taken, part, in, wars, for, centuries, and, the, imposition, of, higher, taxes, on, them, in, place, of, their, quit, rent, led, indirectly, to, the, implementation, of, ryotwari, system, now, the, ryots, could, not, rely, upon, slaves, for, their, agricultural, activities, since, their, slaves, were, enrolled, in, the, army, in, some, places, besides, paying, higher, taxes, they, had, to, endure, the, additional, responsibility, of, feeding, the, slaves, and, financing, their, marriages, this, led, to, the, weakening, of, the, system, of, slavery, in, mysore, the, peak, of, mysore, s, economic, power, was, under, tipu, sultan, in, the, late, 18th, century, along, with, his, father, hyder, ali, he, embarked, on, an, ambitious, program, of, economic, development, aiming, to, increase, the, wealth, and, revenue, of, mysore, under, his, reign, mysore, overtook, bengal, subah, as, india, s, dominant, economic, power, with, highly, productive, agriculture, and, textile, manufacturing, mysore, s, average, income, was, five, times, higher, than, subsistence, level, at, the, time, tipu, sultan, laid, the, foundation, for, the, construction, of, the, kannambadi, dam, present, day, krishna, raja, sagara, or, krs, dam, on, the, kaveri, river, as, attested, by, an, extant, stone, plaque, bearing, his, name, but, was, unable, to, begin, the, construction, the, dam, was, later, built, and, opened, in, 1938, it, is, a, major, source, of, drinking, water, for, the, people, of, mysore, and, bangalore, the, mysore, silk, industry, was, first, initiated, during, the, reign, of, tipu, sultan, he, sent, an, expert, to, bengal, subah, to, study, silk, cultivation, and, processing, after, which, mysore, began, developing, polyvoltine, silk, the, greater, prominence, of, the, channapatna, toys, can, be, traced, to, patronage, from, tipu, sultan, the, historic, ruler, of, mysore, though, these, toys, existed, before, this, period, historically, given, as, gifts, as, part, of, dusshera, celebrations, it, is, known, that, he, was, an, ardent, admirer, of, arts, and, in, particular, of, woodwork, tipu, sultan, was, considered, as, pioneer, of, road, construction, especially, in, malabar, as, part, of, his, campaigns, he, connected, most, of, the, cities, by, roads, both, hyder, ali, and, tipu, sultan, owed, nominal, allegiance, to, the, mughal, emperor, shah, alam, ii, both, were, described, as, nabobs, by, the, british, east, india, company, in, all, existing, treaties, but, unlike, the, nawab, of, carnatic, they, did, not, acknowledge, the, overlordship, of, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, immediately, after, his, coronation, as, badshah, tipu, sultan, sought, the, investiture, of, the, mughal, emperor, he, earned, the, title, nasib, ud, daula, with, the, heavy, heart, of, those, loyal, to, shah, alam, ii, tipu, was, a, selfdeclared, sultan, this, fact, drew, towards, him, the, hostility, of, nizam, ali, khan, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, who, clearly, expressed, his, hostility, by, dissuading, the, mughal, emperor, and, laying, claims, on, mysore, disheartened, tipu, sultan, began, to, establish, contacts, with, other, muslim, rulers, of, that, period, tipu, sultan, was, the, master, of, his, own, diplomacy, with, foreign, nations, in, his, quest, to, rid, india, of, the, east, india, company, and, to, ensure, the, international, strength, of, france, like, his, father, before, him, he, fought, battles, on, behalf, of, foreign, nations, which, were, not, in, the, best, interests, of, shah, alam, ii, after, ghulam, qadir, had, shah, alam, ii, blinded, on, 10, august, 1788, tipu, sultan, is, believed, to, have, broken, into, tears, after, the, fall, of, seringapatam, in, 1799, the, blind, emperor, did, remorse, for, tipu, but, maintained, his, confidence, in, the, nizam, of, hyderabad, who, had, now, made, peace, with, the, british, after, facing, substantial, threats, from, the, marathas, tipu, sultan, began, to, correspond, with, zaman, shah, durrani, the, ruler, of, the, afghan, durrani, empire, so, they, could, defeat, the, british, and, marathas, initially, zaman, shah, agreed, to, help, tipu, but, the, persian, attack, on, afghanistan, s, western, border,

themselves, in, crisis, and, still, recuperating, from, the, devastating, austro, ottoman, war, and, a, new, conflict, with, the, russian, empire, had, begun, for, which, ottoman, turkey, needed, british, alliance, to, keep, off, the, russians, hence, it, could, not, risk, being, hostile, to, the, british, in, the, indian, theatre, due, to, the, ottoman, inability, to, organise, a, fleet, in, the, indian, ocean, tipu, sultan, s, ambassadors, returned, home, only, with, gifts, from, their, ottoman, brothers, nevertheless, tipu, sultan, s, correspondence, with, the, ottoman, empire, and,

twelve, years, both, hyder, ali, and, tipu, sought, an, alliance, with, the, french, the, only, european, power, still, strong, enough, to, challenge, the, british, east, india, company, in, the, subcontinent, in, 1782, louis, xvi, concluded, an, alliance, with, the, peshwa, madhu, rao, narayan, this, treaty, enabled, bussy, to, move, his, troops, to, the, isle, de, france, now, mauritius, in, the, same, year, french, admiral, de, suffren, ceremonially, presented, a, portrait, of, louis, xvi, to, haidar, ali, and, sought, his, alliance, napoleon, conquered, egypt, in, an, attempt, to, link, with, tipu, sultan, in, february, 1798, napoleon, wrote, a, letter, to, tipu, sultan, appreciating, his, efforts, of, resisting, the, british, annexation, and, plans, but, this, letter, never, reached, tipu, and, was, seized, by, a, british, spy, in, muscat, the, idea, of, a, possible, tipu, napoleon, alliance, alarmed, the, british, governor, general, sir, richard, wellesley, also, known, as, lord, wellesley, so, much, that, he, immediately, started, large, scale, preparations, for, a, final, battle, against, tipu, sultan, tipu, sultan, appointed, judges, from, both, communities, for, hindu, and, muslim, subjects, qadi, for, muslims, and, pandit, for, hindus, in, each, province, upper, courts, also, had, similar, systems, usage, of, liquor, and, prostitution, were, strictly,

decree, for, all, women, to, cover, their, breasts, which, was, not, practised, in, kerala, in, the, previous, era, on, a, personal, level, tipu, was, a, devout, muslim, saying, his, prayers, daily, and, paying, special, attention, to, mosques, in, the, area, regular, endowments, were, made, during, this, period, to, about, 156, hindu, temples, including, the, famed, ranganathaswami, temple, at, srirangapatna, many, sources, mention, the, appointment, of, hindu, officers, in, tipu, s, administration, and, his, land, grants, and, endowments, to, hindu, temples, which, are, cited, as, evidence, for, his, religious, tolerance, his, religious, legacy, has, become, a, source, of, considerable, controversy, in, india, with, some, groups, including, christians, and, even, muslims, proclaiming, him, a, great, warrior, for, the, faith, or, ghazi, for, both, religious, and, political, reasons, various, sources, describe, the, massacres, imprisonment, and, forced, conversion, of, hindus, kodavas, of, coorg, nairs, of, malabar, and, christians, catholics, of, mangalore, the, destruction, of, churches, and, temples, and, the, clamping, down, on, muslims, mappila, of, kerala, the, mahdavia, muslims, the, rulers, of, savanur, and, the, people, of, hyderabad, state, which, are, sometimes, cited, as, evidence, for, his, intolerance, historians, such, as, brittlebank, hasan, chetty, habib, and, saletare, amongst, others, argue, that, controversial, stories, of, tipu, sultan, s, religious, persecution, of, hindus, and, christians, are, largely, derived, from, the, work, of, early, british, authors, who, were, very, much, against, tipu, sultan, s, independence, and, harboured, prejudice, against, the, sultan, such, as, james, kirkpatrick, and, mark, wilks, whom, they, do, not, consider, to, be, entirely, reliable, and, likely, fabricated, a, s, chetty, argues, that, wilks, account, in, particular, cannot, be, trusted, irfan, habib, and, mohibbul, hasan, argue, that, these, early, british, authors, had, a, strong, vested, interest, in, presenting, tipu, sultan, as, a, tyrant, from, whom, the, british, had, liberated, mysore, this, assessment, is, echoed, by, brittlebank, in, her, recent, work, where, she, writes, that, wilks, and, kirkpatrick, must, be, used, with, particular, care, as, both, authors, had, taken, part, in, the, wars, against, tipu, sultan, and, were, closely, connected, to, the, administrations, of, lord, cornwallis, and, richard, wellesley, 1st, marquess, wellesley, tipu, sultan, s, treasurer, was, krishna, rao, shamaiya,
