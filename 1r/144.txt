whitney, is, tropical, forest, with, monkeys, which, was, painted, during, the, last, months, of, his, life, it, shows, one, of, his, signature, exotic, landscapes, lush, tropical, and, virgin, many, of, the, animals, in, rousseau, s, images, have, human, faces, or, attributes, the, central, monkeys, in, this, painting, hold, green, sticks, from, which, strings, appear, to, dangle, suggesting, fishing, poles, and, human, leisure, activities, thereby, emphasizing, the, quasi, human, experience, of, the, animals, in, this, sense, rousseau, s, anthropomorphized, primates, can, be, seen, not, as, true, wild, beasts, but, rather, as, representing, an, escape, from, the, jungle, of, paris, and, the, everyday, grind, of, civilized, life, rousseau, exhibited, his, final, painting, the, dream, in, march, 1910, at, the, salon, des, independants, in, the, same, month, rousseau, suffered, a, phlegmon, in, his, leg, one, which, he, ignored, in, august, when, he, was, admitted, to, the, necker,

seven, friends, stood, at, his, grave, the, painters, paul, signac, and, manuel, ortiz, de, z, rate, the, artist, couple, robert, delaunay, and, sonia, terk, the, sculptor, constantin, br, ncu, i, rousseau, s, landlord, armand, queval, and, guillaume, apollinaire, who, wrote, the, epitaph, br, ncu, i, put, on, the, tombstone, we, salute, you, gentle, rousseau, you, can, hear, us, delaunay, his, wife, monsieur, queval, and, myself, let, our, luggage, pass, duty, free, through, the, gates, of, heaven, we, will, bring, you, brushes, paints, and, canvas, that, you, may, spend, your, sacred, leisure, in, the, light, and, truth, of, painting, as, you, once, did, my, portrait, facing, the, stars, lion, and, the, gypsy, rousseau, claimed, he, had, no, teacher, other, than, nature, although, he, admitted, he, had, received, some, advice, from, two, established, academic, painters, f, lix, auguste, cl, ment, and, jean, l, on, g, r, me, essentially, he, was, self, taught, and, is, considered, to, be, a, na, ve, or, primitive, painter, his, best, known, paintings, depict, jungle, scenes, even, though, he, never, left, france, or, saw, a, jungle, stories, spread, by, admirers, that, his, army, service, included, the, french, expeditionary, force, to, mexico, are, unfounded, his, inspiration, came, from, illustrations, in, children, s, books, and, the, botanical, gardens, in, paris, as, well, as, tableaux, of, taxidermy, wild, animals, during, his, term, of, service, he, had, also, met, soldiers, who, had, survived, the, french, expedition, to, mexico, and, he, listened, to, their, stories, of, the, subtropical, country, they, had, encountered, to, the, critic, ars, ne, alexandre, he, described, his, frequent, visits, to, the, jardin, des, plantes, when, i, go, into, the, glass, houses, and, i, see, the, strange, plants, of, exotic, lands, it, seems, to, me, that, i, enter, into, a, dream, along, with, his, exotic, scenes, there, was, a, concurrent, output, of, smaller, topographical, images, of, the, city, and, its, suburbs, he, claimed, to, have, invented, a, new, genre, of, portrait, landscape, which, he, achieved, by, starting, a, painting, with, a, specific, view, such, as, a, favourite, part, of, the, city, and, then, depicting, a, person, in, the, foreground, most, notably, his, early, myself, portrait, landscape, 1890, rousseau, s, flat, seemingly, childish, style, was, disparaged, by, many, critics, people, often, were, shocked, by, his, work, or, ridiculed, it, his, ingenuousness, was, extreme, and, he, always, aspired, in, vain, to, conventional, acceptance, many, observers, commented, that, he, painted, like, a, child, but, the, work, shows, sophistication, with, his, particular, technique, rousseau, s, work, exerted, an, extensive, influence, on, several, generations, of, avant, garde, artists, including, pablo, picasso, jean, hugo, fernand, l, ger, jean, metzinger, max, beckmann, and, the, surrealists, according, to, roberta, smith, an, art, critic, writing, in, the, new, york, times, beckmann, s, amazing, self, portraits, for, example, descend, from, the, brusque, concentrated, forms, of, rousseau, s, portrait, of, the, writer, pierre, loti, in, 1911, a, retrospective, exhibition, of, rousseau, s, works, was, shown, at, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, his, paintings, were, also, shown, at, the, first, blaue, reiter, exhibition, critics, have, noted, the, influence, of, rousseau, on, wallace, stevens, s, poetry, see, for, instance, stevens, s, floral, decorations, for, bananas, in, the, collection, harmonium, the, american, poet, sylvia, plath, was, a, great, admirer, of, rousseau, referencing, his, art, as, well, as, drawing, inspiration, from, his, works, in, her, poetry, the, poem, yadwigha, on, a, red, couch, among, lilies, 1958, is, based, upon, his, painting, the, dream, whilst, the, poem, snakecharmer, 1957, is, based, upon, his, painting, the, snake, charmer, the,

efforts, countered, the, persona, of, the, humble, oblivious, na, f, by, detailing, his, assured, single, mindedness, and, tracked, the, extensive, influence, his, work, exerted, on, several, generations, of, vanguard, artists, critic, roberta, smith, wrote, in, a, review, of, a, later, exhibition, a, major, exhibition, of, his, work, henri, rousseau, jungles, in, paris, was, shown, at,
