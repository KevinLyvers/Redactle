masaccio, uk, m, s, t, i, o, us, m, s, t, i, o, m, z, t, i, o, italian, december, 21, 1401, summer, 1428, born, tommaso, di, ser, giovanni, di, simone, was, a, florentine, artist, who, is, regarded, as, the, first, great, italian, painter, of, the, quattrocento, period, of, the, italian, renaissance, according, to, vasari, masaccio, was, the, best, painter, of, his, generation, because, of, his, skill, at, imitating, nature, recreating, lifelike, figures, and, movements, as, well, as, a, convincing, sense, of, three, dimensionality, he, employed, nudes, and, foreshortenings, in, his, figures, this, had, seldom, been, done, before, him, the, name, masaccio, is, a, humorous, version, of, maso, short, for, tommaso, meaning, clumsy, or, messy, tom, the, name, may, have, been, created, to, distinguish, him, from, his, principal, collaborator, also, called, maso, who, came, to, be, known, as, masolino, little, delicate, tom, despite, his, brief, career, he, had, a, profound, influence, on, other, artists, and, is, considered, to, have, started, the, early, italian, renaissance, in, painting, with, his, works, in, the, mid, and, late, 1420s, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, use, linear, perspective, in, his, painting, employing, techniques, such, as, vanishing, point, in, art, for, the, first, time, he, moved, away, from, the, international, gothic, style, and, elaborate, ornamentation, of, artists, like, gentile, da, fabriano, to, a, more, naturalistic, mode, that, employed, perspective, and, chiaroscuro, for, greater, realism, masaccio, died, at, the, age, of, twenty, six, and, little, is, known, about, the, exact, circumstances, of, his, death, upon, hearing, of, masaccio, s, death, filippo, brunelleschi, said, we, have, suffered, a, great, loss, masaccio, was, born, to, giovanni, di, simone, cassai, and, jacopa, di, martinozzo, in, castel, san, giovanni, di, altura, now, san, giovanni, valdarno, today, part, of, the, province, of, arezzo, tuscany, his, father, was, a, notary, and, his, mother, the, daughter, of, an, innkeeper, of, barberino, di, mugello, a, town, a, few, miles, north, of, florence, his, family, name, cassai, comes, from, the, trade, of, his, paternal, grandfather, simone, and, granduncle, lorenzo, who, were, carpenters, cabinet, makers, casse, hence, cassai, masaccio, s, father, died, in, 1406, when, he, was, only, five, later, that, same, year, a, brother, was, born, named, giovanni, 1406, 1486, after, his, father, he, also, was, to, become, a, painter, with, the, nickname, of, lo, scheggia, meaning, the, splinter, in, 1412, monna, jacopa, married, an, elderly, apothecary, tedesco, di, maestro, feo, who, already, had, several, daughters, one, of, whom, grew, up, to, marry, the, only, other, documented, painter, from, castel, san, giovanni, mariotto, di, cristofano, 1393, 1457, there, is, no, evidence, for, masaccio, s, artistic, education, however, renaissance, painters, traditionally, began, an, apprenticeship, with, an, established, master, around, the, age, of, 12, masaccio, would, likely, have, had, to, move, to, florence, to, receive, his, training, but, he, was, not, documented, in, the, city, until, he, joined, the, painters, guild, the, arte, de, medici, e, speziali, as, an, independent, master, on, january, 7, 1422, signing, as, masus, s, johannis, simonis, pictor, populi, s, nicholae, de, florentia, the, first, works, attributed, to, masaccio, are, the, san, giovenale, triptych, 1422, now, in, the, masaccio, museum, of, sacred, art, in, cascia, di, reggello, near, florence, and, the, virgin, and, child, with, saint, anne, sant, anna, metterza, c, 1424, at, the, uffizi, the, san, giovenale, altarpiece, was, discovered, in, 1961, in, the, church, of, san, giovenale, at, cascia, di, reggello, very, close, to, masaccio, s, hometown, it, depicts, the, virgin, and, child, with, angels, in, the, central, panel, sts, bartholomew, and, blaise, on, the, left, panel, and, sts, juvenal, i, e, san, giovenale, and, anthony, abbot, in, the, right, panel, the, painting, has, lost, much, of, its, original, framing, and, its, surface, is, badly, abraded, nevertheless, masaccio, s, concern, to, suggest, three, dimensionality, through, volumetric, figures, and, foreshortened, forms, is, apparent, and, stands, as, a, revival, of, giotto, s, approach, rather, than, a, continuation, of, contemporary, trends, the, second, work, was, perhaps, masaccio, s, first, collaboration, with, the, older, and, already, renowned, artist, masolino, da, panicale, 1383, 4, c, 1436, the, circumstances, of, the, two, artists, collaboration, are, unclear, since, masolino, was, considerably, older, it, seems, likely, that, he, brought, masaccio, under, his, wing, but, the, division, of, hands, in, the, virgin, and, child, with, saint, anne, is, so, marked, that, it, is, hard, to, see, the, older, artist, as, the, controlling, figure, in, this, commission, masolino, is, believed, to, have, painted, the, figure, of, st, anne, and, the, angels, that, hold, the, cloth, of, honor, behind, her, while, masaccio, painted, the, more, important, virgin, and, child, on, their, throne, masolino, s, figures, are, delicate, graceful, and, somewhat, flat, while, masaccio, s, are, solid, and, hefty, in, florence, masaccio, could, study, the, works, of, giotto, and, become, friends, with, brunelleschi, and, donatello, according, to, vasari, at, their, prompting, in, 1423, masaccio, travelled, to, rome, with, masolino, from, that, point, he, was, freed, of, all, gothic, and, byzantine, influence, as, seen, in, his, altarpiece, for, the, carmelite, church, in, pisa, the, traces, of, influences, from, ancient, roman, and, greek, art, that, are, present, in, some, of, masaccio, s, works, presumably, originated, from, this, trip, they, should, also, have, been, present, in, a, lost, sagra, today, known, through, some, drawings, including, one, by, michelangelo, a, fresco, commissioned, for, the, consecration, ceremony, of, the, church, of, santa, maria, del, carmine, in, florence, april, 19, 1422, it, was, destroyed, when, the, church, s, cloister, was, rebuilt, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, in, 1424, the, duo, preciso, e, noto, well, and, known, duo, of, masaccio, and, masolino, was, commissioned, by, the, powerful, and, wealthy, felice, brancacci, to, execute, a, cycle, of, frescoes, for, the, brancacci, chapel, in, the, church, of, santa, maria, del, carmine, in, florence, with, the, two, artists, probably, working, simultaneously, the, painting, began, around, 1425, but, for, unknown, reasons, the, chapel, was, left, unfinished, and, was, completed, by, filippino, lippi, in, the, 1480s, the, iconography, of, the, fresco, decoration, is, somewhat, unusual, while, the, majority, of, the, frescoes, represent, the, life, of, st, peter, two, scenes, on, either, side, of, the, threshold, of, the, chapel, space, depict, the, temptation, and, expulsion, of, adam, and, eve, as, a, whole, the, frescoes, recount, the, life, of, st, peter, as, if, it, were, the, story, of, salvation, the, style, of, masaccio, s, scenes, shows, the, influence, of, giotto, especially, figures, are, large, heavy, and, solid, emotions, are, expressed, through, faces, and, gestures, and, there, is, a, strong, impression, of, naturalism, throughout, the, paintings, unlike, giotto, however, masaccio, uses, linear, and, atmospheric, perspective, directional, light, and, chiaroscuro, which, is, the, representation, of, form, through, light, and, color, without, outlines, as, a, result, his, frescoes, are, even, more, convincingly, lifelike, than, those, of, his, trecento, predecessor, the, expulsion, from, the, garden, of, eden, depicts, a, distressed, adam, and, eve, chased, from, the, garden, by, a, threatening, angel, adam, covers, his, entire, face, to, express, his, shame, while, eve, covers, her, breasts, and, groin, the, fresco, had, a, huge, influence, on, michelangelo, and, his, work, another, major, work, is, the, tribute, money, in, which, jesus, and, the, apostles, are, depicted, as, neo, classical, archetypes, scholars, have, often, noted, that, the, shadows, of, the, figures, all, fall, away, from, the, chapel, window, as, if, the, figures, are, lit, by, it, this, is, an, added, stroke, of, verisimilitude, and, further, tribute, to, masaccio, s, innovative, genius, in, the, resurrection, of, the, son, of, theophilus, he, painted, a, pavement, in, perspective, framed, by, large, buildings, to, obtain, a, three, dimensional, space, in, which, the, figures, are, placed, proportionate, to, their, surroundings, in, this, he, was, a, pioneer, in, applying, the, newly, discovered, rules, of, perspective, in, september, 1425, masolino, left, the, work, and, went, to, hungary, it, is, not, known, if, this, was, because, of, money, quarrels, with, felice, or, an, artistic, divergence, with, masaccio, it, has, also, been, supposed, that, masolino, planned, this, trip, from, the, very, beginning, and, needed, a, close, collaborator, who, could, continue, the, work, after, his, departure, but, masaccio, left, the, frescoes, unfinished, in, 1426, in, order, to, respond, to, other, commissions, probably, coming, from, the, same, patron, however, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, declining, finances, of, felice, brancacci, were, insufficient, to, pay, for, any, further, work, so, the, painter, sought, work, elsewhere, masaccio, returned, in, 1427, to, work, again, in, the, carmine, beginning, the, resurrection, of, the, son, of, theophilus, but, apparently, left, it, too, unfinished, although, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, painting, was, severely, damaged, later, in, the, century, because, it, had, contained, portraits, of, the, brancacci, family, at, that, time, excoriated, as, enemies, of, the, medici, this, painting, was, either, restored, or, completed, more, than, fifty, years, later, by, filippino, lippi, some, of, the, scenes, completed, by, masaccio, and, masolino, were, lost, in, a, fire, in, 1771, we, know, about, them, only, through, vasari, s, biography, the, surviving, parts, were, extensively, blackened, by, smoke, in, the, twentieth, century, the, removal, of, marble, slabs, covering, two, areas, of, the, paintings, revealed, the, original, appearance, of, the, work, on, february, 19, 1426, masaccio, was, commissioned, by, giuliano, di, colino, degli, scarsi, da, san, giusto, for, the, sum, of, 80, florins, to, paint, a, major, altarpiece, the, pisa, altarpiece, for, his, chapel, in, the, church, of, santa, maria, del, carmine, in, pisa, the, work, was, dismantled, and, dispersed, in, the, 18th, century, and, only, eleven, of, about, twenty, original, panels, have, been, rediscovered, in, various, collections, around, the, world, the, central, panel, of, the, altarpiece, the, madonna, and, child, is, now, in, the, national, gallery, london, although, it, is, very, damaged, the, work, features, a, sculptural, and, human, madonna, as, well, as, a, convincing, perspectival, depiction, of, her, throne, masaccio, probably, worked, on, it, entirely, in, pisa, shuttling, back, and, forth, to, florence, where, he, was, still, working, on, the, brancacci, chapel, in, these, years, donatello, was, also, working, in, pisa, at, a, monument, for, cardinal, rinaldo, brancacci, to, be, sent, to, naples, it, is, suggested, that, masaccio, s, first, ventures, in, plasticity, and, perspective, were, based, on, donatello, s, sculpture, before, he, could, study, brunelleschi, s, more, scientific, approach, to, perspective, around, 1427, masaccio, won, a, prestigious, commission, to, produce, a, holy, trinity, for, the, dominican, church, of, santa, maria, novella, in, florence, no, contemporary, documents, record, the, patron, of, the, fresco, but, recently, references, to, ownership, of, a, tomb, at, the, foot, of, the, fresco, have, been, found, in, the, records, of, the, berti, family, of, the, santa, maria, novella, quarter, of, florence, this, working, class, family, expressed, a, long, standing, devotion, to, the, trinity, and, may, well, have, commissioned, masaccio, s, painting, probably, it, is, the, male, patron, who, is, represented, to, the, left, of, the, virgin, in, the, painting, while, his, wife, is, right, of, st, john, the, evangelist, the, fresco, considered, by, many, to, be, masaccio, s, masterwork, is, the, earliest, surviving, painting, to, use, systematic, linear, perspective, possibly, devised, by, masaccio, with, the, assistance, of, brunelleschi, according, to, the, reconstruction, masaccio, started, by, producing, a, rough, drawing, of, the, composition, and, perspective, lines, on, the, wall, the, drawing, was, covered, with, fresh, plaster, for, making, the, fresco, to, ensure, the, precise, transfer, of, the, perspective, lines, from, the, sketch, to, the, plaster, masaccio, inserted, a, nail, in, at, the, vanishing, point, under, the, base, of, the, cross, and, attached, strings, to, it, which, he, pressed, in, or, carved, into, the, plaster, the, marks, of, the, preparatory, works, are, still, visible, the, sacred, figures, and, the, donors, are, represented, above, an, image, of, a, skeleton, lying, on, a, sarcophagus, an, inscription, seemingly, carved, into, the, wall, above, the, skeleton, reads, io, fui, gia, quel, che, voi, siete, e, quel, ch, io, sono, voi, anco, sarete, i, once, was, what, now, you, are, and, what, i, am, you, shall, yet, be, this, skeleton, is, both, a, reference, to, adam, whose, sin, brought, humans, to, death, and, a, reminder, to, viewers, that, their, time, on, earth, is, transitory, it, is, only, through, faith, in, the, trinity, the, fresco, suggests, that, one, overcomes, this, death, the, holy, spirit, is, seen, in, the, form, of, a, dove, above, jesus, the, combination, of, trinity, death, and, decay, can, be, interpreted, as, a, transposition, of, the, golgotha, chapel, in, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, masaccio, produced, two, other, works, a, nativity, and, an, annunciation, now, lost, before, leaving, for, rome, where, his, companion, masolino, was, frescoing, a, chapel, with, scenes, from, the, life, of, st, catherine, in, the, basilica, di, san, clemente, it, has, never, been, confirmed, that, masaccio, collaborated, on, that, work, even, though, it, is, possible, that, he, contributed, to, masolino, s, polyptych, for, the, altar, of, santa, maria, maggiore, with, his, panel, portraying, st, jerome, and, st, john, the, baptist, now, in, the, national, gallery, of, london, masaccio, died, at, the, end, of, 1428, according, to, a, legend, he, was, poisoned, by, a, jealous, rival, painter, only, four, frescoes, undoubtedly, from, masaccio, s, hand, still, exist, today, although, many, other, works, have, been, at, least, partially, attributed, to, him, others, are, believed, to, have, been, destroyed, masaccio, profoundly, influenced, the, art, of, painting, and, is, considered, to, have, begun, the, early, italian, renaissance, in, painting, according, to, vasari, all, most, celebrated, florentine, sculptors, and, painters, studied, his, frescoes, extensively, in, order, to, learn, the, precepts, and, rules, for, painting, well, he, transformed, the, direction, of, italian, painting, moving, it, away, from, the, idealizations, of, gothic, art, and, for, the, first, time, presenting, it, as, part, of, a, more, profound, natural, and, humanist, world, moreover, masaccio, influenced, a, great, many, artists, both, while, he, was, alive, and, posthumously, his, influence, is, particularly, notable, in, the, works, of, florentine, minor, masters, such, as, andrea, di, giusto, giovanni, dal, ponte, and, others, who, attempted, to, replicate, his, glowing, lifelike, forms
