and, generals, were, i, depend, upon, you, for, everything, i, have, no, other, thoughts, to, leave, behind, it, is, sad, to, part, from, you, his, death, was, kept, secret, by, the, council, of, five, elders, to, preserve, morale, and, they, ordered, the, japanese, forces, in, korea, to, withdraw, back, to, japan, according, to, the, tokugawa, jikki, record, hideyoshi, held, a, secret, meeting, with, koide, hidemasa, and, katagiri, katsumoto, where, he, shared, his, regret, of, launching, invasions, of, korea, hideyoshi, also, instructed, hidemasa, and, katsumoto, to, guide, hideyori, into, making, an, alliance, with, ieyasu, as, he, predicted, the, power, of, the, tokugawa, clan, would, grow, unchecked, after, his, death, and, only, solution, for, the, toyotomi, clan, to, survive, was, to, not, oppose, ieyasu, after, hideyoshi, s, death, the, other, members, of, the, council, of, five, elders, were, unable, to, keep, ieyasu, s, ambitions, in, check, two, of, hideyoshi, s, top, generals, kat, kiyomasa, and, fukushima, masanori, had, fought, bravely, during, the, war, but, returned, to, find, the, toyotomi, clan, castellan, ishida, mitsunari, in, power, he, held, the, generals, in, contempt, and, they, sided, with, ieyasu, hideyori, lost, the, power, his, father, once, held, and, ieyasu, s, power, was, consolidated, when, his, eastern, army, defeated, the, mitsunari, s, western, army, at, the, battle, of, sekigahara, in, 1600, ieyasu, who, was, appointed, as, a, shogun, in, 1603, and, established, the, tokugawa, shogunate, attacked, osaka, castle, twice, in, 1614, and, 1615, the, siege, of, osaka, forcing, hideyoshi, s, concubine, yodo, dono, and, hideyori, to, commit, suicide, destroying, the, toyotomi, clan, it, is, now, believed, that, hideyoshi, s, loss, of, all, his, adult, heirs, leaving, only, the, five, year, old, hideyori, as, his, successor, was, the, primary, reason, for, the, weakening, of, the, toyotomi, regime, and, its, eventual, downfall, toyotomi, hideyoshi, changed, japanese, society, in, many, ways, these, include, the, imposition, of, a, rigid, class, structure, restrictions, on, travel, and, surveys, of, land, and, production, class, reforms, affected, commoners, and, warriors, during, the, sengoku, period, it, had, become, common, for, peasants, to, become, warriors, or, for, samurai, to, farm, due, to, the, constant, uncertainty, caused, by, the, lack, of, centralised, government, and, always, tentative, peace, upon, taking, control, hideyoshi, decreed, that, all, peasants, be, disarmed, completely, conversely, he, required, samurai, to, leave, the, land, and, take, up, residence, in, the, castle, towns, this, solidified, the, social, class, system, for, the, next, 300, years, furthermore, he, ordered, comprehensive, surveys, and, a, complete, census, of, japan, once, this, was, done, and, all, citizens, were, registered, he, required, all, japanese, to, stay, in, their, respective, han, fiefs, unless, they, obtained, official, permission, to, go, elsewhere, this, ensured, order, in, a, period, when, bandits, still, roamed, the, countryside, and, peace, was, still, new, the, land, surveys, formed, the, basis, for, systematic, taxation, in, 1590, hideyoshi, completed, construction, of, the, osaka, castle, the, largest, and, most, formidable, in, all, japan, to, guard, the, western, approaches, to, kyoto, in, that, same, year, hideyoshi, banned, unfree, labour, or, slavery, in, japan, but, forms, of, contract, and, indentured, labour, persisted, alongside, the, period, penal, codes, forced, labour, hideyoshi, also, influenced, the, material, culture, of, japan, he, lavished, time, and, money, on, the, japanese, tea, ceremony, collecting, implements, sponsoring, lavish, social, events, and, patronizing, acclaimed, masters, as, interest, in, the, tea, ceremony, rose, among, the, ruling, class, so, too, did, the, demand, for, fine, ceramic, implements, and, during, the, course, of, the, korean, campaigns, not, only, were, large, quantities, of, prized, ceramic, ware, confiscated, but, many, korean, artisans, were, forcibly, relocated, to, japan, hideyoshi, also, had, a, long, relationship, with, tea, master, sen, no, riky, which, eventually, soured, leading, to, hideyoshi, ordering, sen, no, riky, to, commit, suicide, the, exact, reason, is, disputed, inspired, by, the, dazzling, golden, pavilion, in, kyoto, he, had, the, golden, tea, room, constructed, which, was, covered, with, gold, leaf, and, lined, inside, with, red, gossamer, using, this, mobile, innovation, he, was, able, to, practice, the, tea, ceremony, wherever, he, went, displaying, his, power, and, status, at, all, times, politically, he, set, up, a, governmental, system, that, balanced, out, the, most, powerful, japanese, warlords, or, daimy, a, council, was, created, to, include, the, most, influential, lords, at, the, same, time, a, regent, was, designated, to, be, in, command, just, before, his, death, hideyoshi, hoped, to, set, up, a, system, stable, enough, to, survive, until, his, son, grew, old, enough, to, become, the, next, leader, a, council, of, five, elders, go, tair, was, formed, consisting, of, the, five, most, powerful, daimy, following, the, death, of, maeda, toshiie, however, tokugawa, ieyasu, began, to, secure, alliances, including, political, marriages, which, had, been, forbidden, by, hideyoshi, eventually, the, pro, toyotomi, forces, fought, against, the, tokugawa, in, the, battle, of, sekigahara, ieyasu, won, and, received, the, title, of, seii, tai, sh, gun, two, years, later, hideyoshi, is, commemorated, at, several, toyokuni, shrines, scattered, over, japan, ieyasu, left, in, place, the, majority, of, hideyoshi, s, decrees, and, built, his, shogunate, upon, them, this, ensured, that, hideyoshi, s, cultural, legacy, remained, in, a, letter, to, his, wife, hideyoshi, wrote, i, mean, to, do, glorious, deeds, and, i, am, ready, for, a, long, siege, with, provisions, and, gold, and, silver, in, plenty, so, as, to, return, in, triumph, and, leave, a, great, name, behind, me, i, desire, you, to, understand, this,
