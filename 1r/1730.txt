louis, pasteur, formemrs, l, u, i, p, s, t, r, french, 27, december, 1822, 28, september, 1895, was, a, french, chemist, pharmacist, and, microbiologist, renowned, for, his, discoveries, of, the, principles, of, vaccination, microbial, fermentation, and, pasteurization, the, last, of, which, was, named, after, him, his, research, in, chemistry, led, to, remarkable, breakthroughs, in, the, understanding, of, the, causes, and, preventions, of, diseases, which, laid, down, the, foundations, of, hygiene, public, health, and, much, of, modern, medicine, pasteur, s, works, are, credited, with, saving, millions, of, lives, through, the, developments, of, vaccines, for, rabies, and, anthrax, he, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, bacteriology, and, has, been, honored, as, the, father, of, bacteriology, and, the, father, of, microbiology, together, with, robert, koch, the, latter, epithet, also, attributed, to, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, pasteur, was, responsible, for, disproving, the, doctrine, of, spontaneous, generation, under, the, auspices, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, his, experiment, demonstrated, that, in, sterilized, and, sealed, flasks, nothing, ever, developed, conversely, in, sterilized, but, open, flasks, microorganisms, could, grow, for, this, experiment, the, academy, awarded, him, the, alhumbert, prize, carrying, 2, 500, francs, in, 1862, pasteur, is, also, regarded, as, one, of, the, fathers, of, germ, theory, of, diseases, which, was, a, minor, medical, concept, at, the, time, his, many, experiments, showed, that, diseases, could, be, prevented, by, killing, or, stopping, germs, thereby, directly, supporting, the, germ, theory, and, its, application, in, clinical, medicine, he, is, best, known, to, the, general, public, for, his, invention, of, the, technique, of, treating, milk, and, wine, to, stop, bacterial, contamination, a, process, now, called, pasteurization, pasteur, also, made, significant, discoveries, in, chemistry, most, notably, on, the, molecular, basis, for, the, asymmetry, of, certain, crystals, and, racemization, early, in, his, career, his, investigation, of, sodium, ammonium, tartrate, initiated, the, field, of, optical, isomerism, this, work, had, a, profound, effect, on, structural, chemistry, with, eventual, implications, for, many, areas, including, medicinal, chemistry, he, was, the, director, of, the, pasteur, institute, established, in, 1887, until, his, death, and, his, body, was, interred, in, a, vault, beneath, the, institute, although, pasteur, made, groundbreaking, experiments, his, reputation, became, associated, with, various, controversies, historical, reassessment, of, his, notebook, revealed, that, he, practiced, deception, to, overcome, his, rivals, louis, pasteur, was, born, on, 27, december, 1822, in, dole, jura, france, to, a, catholic, family, of, a, poor, tanner, he, was, the, third, child, of, jean, joseph, pasteur, and, jeanne, etiennette, roqui, the, family, moved, to, marnoz, in, 1826, and, then, to, arbois, in, 1827, pasteur, entered, primary, school, in, 1831, he, was, dyslexic, and, dysgraphic, he, was, an, average, student, in, his, early, years, and, not, particularly, academic, as, his, interests, were, fishing, and, sketching, he, drew, many, pastels, and, portraits, of, his, parents, friends, and, neighbors, pasteur, attended, secondary, school, at, the, coll, ge, d, arbois, in, october, 1838, he, left, for, paris, to, enroll, in, a, boarding, school, but, became, homesick, and, returned, in, november, in, 1839, he, entered, the, coll, ge, royal, at, besan, on, to, study, philosophy, and, earned, his, bachelor, of, letters, degree, in, 1840, he, was, appointed, a, tutor, at, the, besan, on, college, while, continuing, a, degree, science, course, with, special, mathematics, he, failed, his, first, examination, in, 1841, he, managed, to, pass, the, baccalaur, at, scientifique, general, science, degree, from, dijon, where, he, earned, his, bachelor, of, science, in, mathematics, degree, bachelier, s, sciences, math, matiques, in, 1842, but, with, a, mediocre, grade, in, chemistry, later, in, 1842, pasteur, took, the, entrance, test, for, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, during, the, test, he, had, to, fight, fatigue, and, only, felt, comfortable, with, physics, and, mathematics, he, passed, the, first, set, of, tests, but, because, his, ranking, was, low, pasteur, decided, not, to, continue, and, try, again, next, year, he, went, back, to, the, parisian, boarding, school, to, prepare, for, the, test, he, also, attended, classes, at, the, lyc, e, saint, louis, and, lectures, of, jean, baptiste, dumas, at, the, sorbonne, in, 1843, he, passed, the, test, with, a, high, ranking, and, entered, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, in, 1845, he, received, the, licenci, s, sciences, degree, in, 1846, he, was, appointed, professor, of, physics, at, the, coll, ge, de, tournon, now, called, lyc, e, gabriel, faure, in, ard, che, but, the, chemist, antoine, j, r, me, balard, wanted, him, back, at, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, as, a, graduate, laboratory, assistant, agr, g, pr, parateur, he, joined, balard, and, simultaneously, started, his, research, in, crystallography, and, in, 1847, he, submitted, his, two, theses, one, in, chemistry, and, the, other, in, physics, a, chemistry, thesis, recherches, sur, la, capacit, de, saturation, de, l, acide, ars, nieux, etudes, des, ars, nites, de, potasse, de, soude, et, d, ammoniaque, b, physics, thesis, 1, tudes, des, ph, nom, nes, relatifs, la, polarisation, rotatoire, des, liquides, 2, application, de, la, polarisation, rotatoire, des, liquides, la, solution, de, diverses, questions, de, chimie, after, serving, briefly, as, professor, of, physics, at, the, dijon, lyc, e, in, 1848, he, became, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, university, of, strasbourg, where, he, met, and, courted, marie, laurent, daughter, of, the, university, s, rector, in, 1849, they, were, married, on, 29, may, 1849, and, together, had, five, children, only, two, of, whom, survived, to, adulthood, the, other, three, died, of, typhoid, pasteur, was, appointed, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, university, of, strasbourg, in, 1848, and, became, the, chair, of, chemistry, in, 1852, in, february, 1854, so, that, he, would, have, time, to, carry, out, work, that, could, earn, him, the, title, of, correspondent, of, the, institute, he, got, three, months, paid, leave, with, the, help, of, a, medical, certificate, of, convenience, he, extended, the, leave, until, 1, august, the, date, of, the, start, of, the, exams, i, tell, the, minister, that, i, will, go, and, do, the, examinations, so, as, not, to, increase, the, embarrassment, of, the, service, it, is, also, so, as, not, to, leave, to, another, a, sum, of, 6, or, 700, francs, in, this, same, year, 1854, he, was, named, dean, of, the, new, faculty, of, sciences, at, university, of, lille, where, he, began, his, studies, on, fermentation, it, was, on, this, occasion, that, pasteur, uttered, his, oft, quoted, remark, dans, les, champs, de, l, observation, le, hasard, ne, favorise, que, les, esprits, pr, par, s, in, the, field, of, observation, chance, favors, only, the, prepared, mind, in, 1857, he, moved, to, paris, as, the, director, of, scientific, studies, at, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, where, he, took, control, from, 1858, to, 1867, and, introduced, a, series, of, reforms, to, improve, the, standard, of, scientific, work, the, examinations, became, more, rigid, which, led, to, better, results, greater, competition, and, increased, prestige, many, of, his, decrees, however, were, rigid, and, authoritarian, leading, to, two, serious, student, revolts, during, the, bean, revolt, he, decreed, that, a, mutton, stew, which, students, had, refused, to, eat, would, be, served, and, eaten, every, monday, on, another, occasion, he, threatened, to, expel, any, student, caught, smoking, and, 73, of, the, 80, students, in, the, school, resigned, in, 1863, he, was, appointed, professor, of, geology, physics, and, chemistry, at, the, cole, nationale, sup, rieure, des, beaux, arts, a, position, he, held, until, his, resignation, in, 1867, in, 1867, he, became, the, chair, of, organic, chemistry, at, the, sorbonne, but, he, later, gave, up, the, position, because, of, poor, health, in, 1867, the, cole, normale, s, laboratory, of, physiological, chemistry, was, created, at, pasteur, s, request, and, he, was, the, laboratory, s, director, from, 1867, to, 1888, in, paris, he, established, the, pasteur, institute, in, 1887, in, which, he, was, its, director, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, pasteur, s, early, work, as, a, chemist, beginning, at, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, and, continuing, at, strasbourg, and, lille, he, examined, the, chemical, optical, and, crystallographic, properties, of, a, group, of, compounds, known, as, tartrates, he, resolved, a, problem, concerning, the, nature, of, tartaric, acid, in, 1848, a, solution, of, this, compound, derived, from, living, things, rotated, the, plane, of, polarization, of, light, passing, through, it, the, problem, was, that, tartaric, acid, derived, by, chemical, synthesis, had, no, such, effect, even, though, its, chemical, reactions, were, identical, and, its, elemental, composition, was, the, same, pasteur, noticed, that, crystals, of, tartrates, had, small, faces, then, he, observed, that, in, racemic, mixtures, of, tartrates, half, of, the, crystals, were, right, handed, and, half, were, left, handed, in, solution, the, right, handed, compound, was, dextrorotatory, and, the, left, handed, one, was, levorotatory, pasteur, determined, that, optical, activity, related, to, the, shape, of, the, crystals, and, that, an, asymmetric, internal, arrangement, of, the, molecules, of, the, compound, was, responsible, for, twisting, the, light, the, 2, r, 3, r, and, 2, s, 3, s, tartrates, were, isometric, non, superposable, mirror, images, of, each, other, this, was, the, first, time, anyone, had, demonstrated, molecular, chirality, and, also, the, first, explanation, of, isomerism, some, historians, consider, pasteur, s, work, in, this, area, to, be, his, most, profound, and, most, original, contributions, to, science, and, his, greatest, scientific, discovery, pasteur, was, motivated, to, investigate, fermentation, while, working, at, lille, in, 1856, a, local, wine, manufacturer, m, bigot, whose, son, was, one, of, pasteur, s, students, sought, for, his, advice, on, the, problems, of, making, beetroot, alcohol, and, souring, pasteur, began, his, research, in, the, topic, by, repeating, and, confirming, works, of, theodor, schwann, who, demonstrated, a, decade, earlier, that, yeast, were, alive, according, to, his, son, in, law, ren, vallery, radot, in, august, 1857, pasteur, sent, a, paper, about, lactic, acid, fermentation, to, the, soci, t, des, sciences, de, lille, but, the, paper, was, read, three, months, later, a, memoire, was, subsequently, published, on, 30, november, 1857, in, the, memoir, he, developed, his, ideas, stating, that, i, intend, to, establish, that, just, as, there, is, an, alcoholic, ferment, the, yeast, of, beer, which, is, found, everywhere, that, sugar, is, decomposed, into, alcohol, and, carbonic, acid, so, also, there, is, a, particular, ferment, a, lactic, yeast, always, present, when, sugar, becomes, lactic, acid, pasteur, also, wrote, about, alcoholic, fermentation, it, was, published, in, full, form, in, 1858, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, and, justus, von, liebig, had, proposed, the, theory, that, fermentation, was, caused, by, decomposition, pasteur, demonstrated, that, this, theory, was, incorrect, and, that, yeast, was, responsible, for, fermentation, to, produce, alcohol, from, sugar, he, also, demonstrated, that, when, a, different, microorganism, contaminated, the, wine, lactic, acid, was, produced, making, the, wine, sour, in, 1861, pasteur, observed, that, less, sugar, fermented, per, part, of, yeast, when, the, yeast, was, exposed, to, air, the, lower, rate, of, fermentation, aerobically, became, known, as, the, pasteur, effect, pasteur, s, research, also, showed, that, the, growth, of, micro, organisms, was, responsible, for, spoiling, beverages, such, as, beer, wine, and, milk, with, this, established, he, invented, a, process, in, which, liquids, such, as, milk, were, heated, to, a, temperature, between, 60, and, 100, c, this, killed, most, bacteria, and, moulds, already, present, within, them, pasteur, and, claude, bernard, completed, tests, on, blood, and, urine, on, 20, april, 1862, pasteur, patented, the, process, to, fight, the, diseases, of, wine, in, 1865, the, method, became, known, as, pasteurization, and, was, soon, applied, to, beer, and, milk, beverage, contamination, led, pasteur, to, the, idea, that, micro, organisms, infecting, animals, and, humans, cause, disease, he, proposed, preventing, the, entry, of, micro, organisms, into, the, human, body, leading, joseph, lister, to, develop, antiseptic, methods, in, surgery, in, 1866, pasteur, published, tudes, sur, le, vin, about, the, diseases, of, wine, and, he, published, tudes, sur, la, bi, re, in, 1876, concerning, the, diseases, of, beer, in, the, early, 19th, century, agostino, bassi, had, shown, that, muscardine, was, caused, by, a, fungus, that, infected, silkworms, since, 1853, two, diseases, called, p, brine, and, flacherie, had, been, infecting, great, numbers, of, silkworms, in, southern, france, and, by, 1865, they, were, causing, huge, losses, to, farmers, in, 1865, pasteur, went, to, al, s, and, worked, for, five, years, until, 1870, silkworms, with, p, brine, were, covered, in, corpuscles, in, the, first, three, years, pasteur, thought, that, the, corpuscles, were, a, symptom, of, the, disease, in, 1870, he, concluded, that, the, corpuscles, were, the, cause, of, p, brine, it, is, now, known, that, the, cause, is, a, microsporidian, pasteur, also, showed, that, the, disease, was, hereditary, pasteur, developed, a, system, to, prevent, p, brine, after, the, female, moths, laid, their, eggs, the, moths, were, turned, into, a, pulp, the, pulp, was, examined, with, a, microscope, and, if, corpuscles, were, observed, the, eggs, were, destroyed, pasteur, concluded, that, bacteria, caused, flacherie, the, primary, cause, is, currently, thought, to, be, viruses, the, spread, of, flacherie, could, be, accidental, or, hereditary, hygiene, could, be, used, to, prevent, accidental, flacherie, moths, whose, digestive, cavities, did, not, contain, the, microorganisms, causing, flacherie, were, used, to, lay, eggs, preventing, hereditary, flacherie, following, his, fermentation, experiments, pasteur, demonstrated, that, the, skin, of, grapes, was, the, natural, source, of, yeasts, and, that, sterilized, grapes, and, grape, juice, never, fermented, he, drew, grape, juice, from, under, the, skin, with, sterilized, needles, and, also, covered, grapes, with, sterilized, cloth, both, experiments, could, not, produce, wine, in, sterilized, containers, his, findings, and, ideas, were, against, the, prevailing, notion, of, spontaneous, generation, he, received, a, particularly, stern, criticism, from, f, lix, archim, de, pouchet, who, was, director, of, the, rouen, museum, of, natural, history, to, settle, the, debate, between, the, eminent, scientists, the, french, academy, of, sciences, offered, the, alhumbert, prize, carrying, 2, 500, francs, to, whoever, could, experimentally, demonstrate, for, or, against, the, doctrine, pouchet, stated, that, air, everywhere, could, cause, spontaneous, generation, of, living, organisms, in, liquids, in, the, late, 1850s, he, performed, experiments, and, claimed, that, they, were, evidence, of, spontaneous, generation, francesco, redi, and, lazzaro, spallanzani, had, provided, some, evidence, against, spontaneous, generation, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, respectively, spallanzani, s, experiments, in, 1765, suggested, that, air, contaminated, broths, with, bacteria, in, the, 1860s, pasteur, repeated, spallanzani, s, experiments, but, pouchet, reported, a, different, result, using, a, different, broth, pasteur, performed, several, experiments, to, disprove, spontaneous, generation, he, placed, boiled, liquid, in, a, flask, and, let, hot, air, enter, the, flask, then, he, closed, the, flask, and, no, organisms, grew, in, it, in, another, experiment, when, he, opened, flasks, containing, boiled, liquid, dust, entered, the, flasks, causing, organisms, to, grow, in, some, of, them, the, number, of, flasks, in, which, organisms, grew, was, lower, at, higher, altitudes, showing, that, air, at, high, altitudes, contained, less, dust, and, fewer, organisms, pasteur, also, used, swan, neck, flasks, containing, a, fermentable, liquid, air, was, allowed, to, enter, the, flask, via, a, long, curving, tube, that, made, dust, particles, stick, to, it, nothing, grew, in, the, broths, unless, the, flasks, were, tilted, making, the, liquid, touch, the, contaminated, walls, of, the, neck, this, showed, that, the, living, organisms, that, grew, in, such, broths, came, from, outside, on, dust, rather, than, spontaneously, generating, within, the, liquid, or, from, the, action, of, pure, air, these, were, some, of, the, most, important, experiments, disproving, the, theory, of, spontaneous, generation, pasteur, gave, a, series, of, five, presentations, of, his, findings, before, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, 1881, which, were, published, in, 1882, as, m, moire, sur, les, corpuscules, organis, s, qui, existent, dans, l, atmosph, re, examen, de, la, doctrine, des, g, n, rations, spontan, es, account, of, organized, corpuscles, existing, in, the, atmosphere, examining, the, doctrine, of, spontaneous, generation, pasteur, won, the, alhumbert, prize, in, 1862, he, concluded, that, never, will, the, doctrine, of, spontaneous, generation, recover, from, the, mortal, blow, of, this, simple, experiment, there, is, no, known, circumstance, in, which, it, can, be, confirmed, that, microscopic, beings, came, into, the, world, without, germs, without, parents, similar, to, themselves, in, 1865, jean, baptiste, dumas, chemist, senator, and, former, minister, of, agriculture, and, commerce, asked, pasteur, to, study, a, new, disease, that, was, decimating, silkworm, farms, from, the, south, of, france, and, europe, the, p, brine, characterized, on, a, macroscopic, scale, by, black, spots, and, on, a, microscopic, scale, by, the, cornalia, corpuscles, pasteur, accepted, and, made, five, long, stays, in, al, s, between, 7, june, 1865, and, 1869, arriving, in, al, s, pasteur, familiarized, himself, with, p, brine, and, also, with, another, disease, of, the, silkworm, known, earlier, than, pebrine, flacherie, or, dead, flat, disease, contrary, for, example, to, quatrefages, who, coined, the, new, word, p, brine, pasteur, made, the, mistake, of, believing, that, the, two, diseases, were, the, same, and, even, that, most, of, the, diseases, of, silkworms, known, up, to, that, time, were, identical, with, each, other, and, with, p, brine, it, was, in, letters, of, 30, april, and, 21, may, 1867, to, dumas, that, he, first, made, the, distinction, between, p, brine, and, flacherie, he, made, another, mistake, he, began, by, denying, the, parasitic, microbial, nature, of, p, brine, which, several, scholars, notably, antoine, b, champ, considered, well, established, even, a, note, published, on, 27, august, 1866, by, balbiani, which, pasteur, at, first, seemed, to, welcome, favourably, had, no, effect, at, least, immediately, pasteur, is, mistaken, he, would, only, change, his, mind, in, the, course, of, 1867, at, a, time, where, pasteur, had, not, yet, understood, the, cause, of, the, p, brine, he, propagated, an, effective, process, to, stop, infections, a, sample, of, chrysalises, was, chosen, they, were, crushed, and, the, corpuscles, were, searched, for, in, the, crushed, material, if, the, proportion, of, corpuscular, pupae, in, the, sample, was, very, low, the, chamber, was, considered, good, for, reproduction, this, method, of, sorting, seeds, eggs, is, close, to, a, method, that, osimo, had, proposed, a, few, years, earlier, but, whose, trials, had, not, been, conclusive, by, this, process, pasteur, curbs, p, brine, and, saves, many, of, the, silk, industry, in, the, c, vennes, in, 1878, at, the, congr, s, international, s, ricicole, pasteur, admitted, that, if, p, brine, is, overcome, flacherie, still, exerts, its, ravages, he, attributed, the, persistence, of, flacherie, to, the, fact, that, the, farmers, had, not, followed, his, advice, in, 1884, balbiani, who, disregarded, the, theoretical, value, of, pasteur, s, work, on, silkworm, diseases, acknowledged, that, his, practical, process, had, remedied, the, ravages, of, p, brine, but, added, that, this, result, tended, to, be, counterbalanced, by, the, development, of, flacherie, which, was, less, well, known, and, more, difficult, to, prevent, despite, pasteur, s, success, against, p, brine, french, sericulture, had, not, been, saved, from, damage, see, fr, s, riciculture, in, the, french, wikipedia, pasteur, s, first, work, on, vaccine, development, was, on, chicken, cholera, he, received, the, bacteria, samples, later, called, pasteurella, multocida, after, him, from, henry, toussaint, he, started, the, study, in, 1877, and, by, the, next, year, was, able, to, maintain, a, stable, culture, using, broths, after, another, year, of, continuous, culturing, he, found, that, the, bacteria, were, less, pathogenic, some, of, his, culture, samples, could, no, longer, induce, the, disease, in, healthy, chickens, in, 1879, pasteur, planning, for, holiday, instructed, his, assistant, charles, chamberland, to, inoculate, the, chickens, with, fresh, bacteria, culture, chamberland, forgot, and, went, on, holiday, himself, on, his, return, he, injected, the, month, old, cultures, to, healthy, chickens, the, chickens, showed, some, symptoms, of, infection, but, instead, of, the, infections, being, fatal, as, they, usually, were, the, chickens, recovered, completely, chamberland, assumed, an, error, had, been, made, and, wanted, to, discard, the, apparently, faulty, culture, but, pasteur, stopped, him, pasteur, injected, the, freshly, recovered, chickens, with, fresh, bacteria, that, normally, would, kill, other, chickens, the, chickens, no, longer, showed, any, sign, of, infection, it, was, clear, to, him, that, the, weakened, bacteria, had, caused, the, chickens, to, become, immune, to, the, disease, in, december, 1880, pasteur, presented, his, results, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, as, sur, les, maladies, virulentes, et, en, particulier, sur, la, maladie, appel, e, vulgairement, chol, ra, des, poules, on, virulent, diseases, and, in, particular, on, the, disease, commonly, called, chicken, cholera, and, published, it, in, the, academy, s, journal, comptes, rendus, hebdomadaires, des, s, ances, de, l, acad, mie, des, sciences, he, attributed, that, the, bacteria, were, weakened, by, contact, with, oxygen, he, explained, that, bacteria, kept, in, sealed, containers, never, lost, their, virulence, and, only, those, exposed, to, air, in, culture, media, could, be, used, as, vaccine, pasteur, introduced, the, term, attenuation, for, this, weakening, of, virulence, as, he, presented, before, the, academy, saying, we, can, diminish, the, microbe, s, virulence, by, changing, the, mode, of, culturing, this, is, the, crucial, point, of, my, subject, i, ask, the, academy, not, to, criticize, for, the, time, being, the, confidence, of, my, proceedings, that, permit, me, to, determine, the, microbe, s, attenuation, in, order, to, save, the, independence, of, my, studies, and, to, better, assure, their, progress, i, would, like, to, point, out, to, the, academy, two, main, consequences, to, the, facts, presented, the, hope, to, culture, all, microbes, and, to, find, a, vaccine, for, all, infectious, diseases, that, have, repeatedly, afflicted, humanity, and, are, a, major, burden, on, agriculture, and, breeding, of, domestic, animals, in, fact, pasteur, s, vaccine, against, chicken, cholera, was, not, regular, in, its, effects, and, was, a, failure, in, the, 1870s, he, applied, this, immunization, method, to, anthrax, which, affected, cattle, and, aroused, interest, in, combating, other, diseases, pasteur, cultivated, bacteria, from, the, blood, of, animals, infected, with, anthrax, when, he, inoculated, animals, with, the, bacteria, anthrax, occurred, proving, that, the, bacteria, was, the, cause, of, the, disease, many, cattle, were, dying, of, anthrax, in, cursed, fields, pasteur, was, told, that, sheep, that, died, from, anthrax, were, buried, in, the, field, pasteur, thought, that, earthworms, might, have, brought, the, bacteria, to, the, surface, he, found, anthrax, bacteria, in, earthworms, excrement, showing, that, he, was, correct, he, told, the, farmers, not, to, bury, dead, animals, in, the, fields, pasteur, had, been, trying, to, develop, the, anthrax, vaccine, since, 1877, soon, after, robert, koch, s, discovery, of, the, bacterium, on, 12, july, 1880, henri, bouley, read, before, the, french, academy, of, sciences, a, report, from, henry, toussaint, a, veterinary, surgeon, who, was, not, member, of, the, academy, toussaint, had, developed, anthrax, vaccine, by, killing, the, bacilli, by, heating, at, 55, c, for, 10, minutes, he, tested, on, eight, dogs, and, 11, sheep, half, of, which, died, after, inoculation, it, was, not, a, great, success, upon, hearing, the, news, pasteur, immediately, wrote, to, the, academy, that, he, could, not, believe, that, dead, vaccine, would, work, and, that, toussaint, s, claim, overturns, all, the, ideas, i, had, on, viruses, vaccines, etc, following, pasteur, s, criticism, toussaint, switched, to, carbolic, acid, phenol, to, kill, anthrax, bacilli, and, tested, the, vaccine, on, sheep, in, august, 1880, pasteur, thought, that, this, type, of, killed, vaccine, should, not, work, because, he, believed, that, attenuated, bacteria, used, up, nutrients, that, the, bacteria, needed, to, grow, he, thought, oxidizing, bacteria, made, them, less, virulent, but, pasteur, found, that, anthrax, bacillus, was, not, easily, weakened, by, culturing, in, air, as, it, formed, spores, unlike, chicken, cholera, bacillus, in, early, 1881, he, discovered, that, growing, anthrax, bacilli, at, about, 42, c, made, them, unable, to, produce, spores, and, he, described, this, method, in, a, speech, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, on, 28, february, on, 21, march, he, announced, successful, vaccination, of, sheep, to, this, news, veterinarian, hippolyte, rossignol, proposed, that, the, soci, t, d, agriculture, de, melun, organize, an, experiment, to, test, pasteur, s, vaccine, pasteur, signed, agreement, of, the, challenge, on, 28, april, a, public, experiment, was, conducted, in, may, at, pouilly, le, fort, 58, sheep, 2, goats, and, 10, cattle, were, used, half, of, which, were, given, the, vaccine, on, 5, and, 17, may, while, the, other, half, was, untreated, all, the, animals, were, injected, with, the, fresh, virulent, culture, of, anthrax, bacillus, on, 31, may, the, official, result, was, observed, and, analysed, on, 2, june, in, the, presence, of, over, 200, spectators, all, cattle, survived, vaccinated, or, not, pasteur, had, bravely, predicted, i, hypothesized, that, the, six, vaccinated, cows, would, not, become, very, ill, while, the, four, unvaccinated, cows, would, perish, or, at, least, become, very, ill, however, all, vaccinated, sheep, and, goats, survived, while, unvaccinated, ones, had, died, or, were, dying, before, the, viewers, his, report, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, on, 13, june, concludes, looking, at, everything, from, the, scientific, point, of, view, the, development, of, a, vaccination, against, anthrax, constitutes, significant, progress, beyond, the, first, vaccine, developed, by, jenner, since, the, latter, had, never, been, obtained, experimentally, pasteur, did, not, directly, disclose, how, he, prepared, the, vaccines, used, at, pouilly, le, fort, although, his, report, indicated, it, as, a, live, vaccine, his, laboratory, notebooks, show, that, he, actually, used, potassium, dichromate, killed, vaccine, as, developed, by, chamberland, quite, similar, to, toussaint, s, method, the, notion, of, a, weak, form, of, a, disease, causing, immunity, to, the, virulent, version, was, not, new, this, had, been, known, for, a, long, time, for, smallpox, inoculation, with, smallpox, variolation, was, known, to, result, in, a, much, less, severe, disease, and, greatly, reduced, mortality, in, comparison, with, the, naturally, acquired, disease, edward, jenner, had, also, studied, vaccination, using, cowpox, vaccinia, to, give, cross, immunity, to, smallpox, in, the, late, 1790s, and, by, the, early, 1800s, vaccination, had, spread, to, most, of, europe, the, difference, between, smallpox, vaccination, and, anthrax, or, chicken, cholera, vaccination, was, that, the, latter, two, disease, organisms, had, been, artificially, weakened, so, a, naturally, weak, form, of, the, disease, organism, did, not, need, to, be, found, this, discovery, revolutionized, work, in, infectious, diseases, and, pasteur, gave, these, artificially, weakened, diseases, the, generic, name, of, vaccines, in, honour, of, jenner, s, discovery, in, 1876, robert, koch, had, shown, that, bacillus, anthracis, caused, anthrax, in, his, papers, published, between, 1878, and, 1880, pasteur, only, mentioned, koch, s, work, in, a, footnote, koch, met, pasteur, at, the, seventh, international, medical, congress, in, 1881, a, few, months, later, koch, wrote, that, pasteur, had, used, impure, cultures, and, made, errors, in, 1882, pasteur, replied, to, koch, in, a, speech, to, which, koch, responded, aggressively, koch, stated, that, pasteur, tested, his, vaccine, on, unsuitable, animals, and, that, pasteur, s, research, was, not, properly, scientific, in, 1882, koch, wrote, on, the, anthrax, inoculation, in, which, he, refuted, several, of, pasteur, s, conclusions, about, anthrax, and, criticized, pasteur, for, keeping, his, methods, secret, jumping, to, conclusions, and, being, imprecise, in, 1883, pasteur, wrote, that, he, used, cultures, prepared, in, a, similar, way, to, his, successful, fermentation, experiments, and, that, koch, misinterpreted, statistics, and, ignored, pasteur, s, work, on, silkworms, in, 1882, pasteur, sent, his, assistant, louis, thuillier, to, southern, france, because, of, an, epizootic, of, swine, erysipelas, thuillier, identified, the, bacillus, that, caused, the, disease, in, march, 1883, pasteur, and, thuillier, increased, the, bacillus, s, virulence, after, passing, it, through, pigeons, then, they, passed, the, bacillus, through, rabbits, weakening, it, and, obtaining, a, vaccine, pasteur, and, thuillier, incorrectly, described, the, bacterium, as, a, figure, eight, shape, roux, described, the, bacterium, as, stick, shaped, in, 1884, pasteur, produced, the, first, vaccine, for, rabies, by, growing, the, virus, in, rabbits, and, then, weakening, it, by, drying, the, affected, nerve, tissue, the, rabies, vaccine, was, initially, created, by, emile, roux, a, french, doctor, and, a, colleague, of, pasteur, who, had, produced, a, killed, vaccine, using, this, method, the, vaccine, had, been, tested, in, 50, dogs, before, its, first, human, trial, this, vaccine, was, used, on, 9, year, old, joseph, meister, on, 6, july, 1885, after, the, boy, was, badly, mauled, by, a, rabid, dog, this, was, done, at, some, personal, risk, for, pasteur, since, he, was, not, a, licensed, physician, and, could, have, faced, prosecution, for, treating, the, boy, after, consulting, with, physicians, he, decided, to, go, ahead, with, the, treatment, over, 11, days, meister, received, 13, inoculations, each, inoculation, using, viruses, that, had, been, weakened, for, a, shorter, period, of, time, three, months, later, he, examined, meister, and, found, that, he, was, in, good, health, pasteur, was, hailed, as, a, hero, and, the, legal, matter, was, not, pursued, analysis, of, his, laboratory, notebooks, shows, that, pasteur, had, treated, two, people, before, his, vaccination, of, meister, one, survived, but, may, not, actually, have, had, rabies, and, the, other, died, of, rabies, pasteur, began, treatment, of, jean, baptiste, jupille, on, 20, october, 1885, and, the, treatment, was, successful, later, in, 1885, people, including, four, children, from, the, united, states, went, to, pasteur, s, laboratory, to, be, inoculated, in, 1886, he, treated, 350, people, of, which, only, one, developed, rabies, the, treatment, s, success, laid, the, foundations, for, the, manufacture, of, many, other, vaccines, the, first, of, the, pasteur, institutes, was, also, built, on, the, basis, of, this, achievement, in, the, story, of, san, michele, axel, munthe, writes, of, some, risks, pasteur, undertook, in, the, rabies, vaccine, research, pasteur, himself, was, absolutely, fearless, anxious, to, secure, a, sample, of, saliva, straight, from, the, jaws, of, a, rabid, dog, i, once, saw, him, with, the, glass, tube, held, between, his, lips, draw, a, few, drops, of, the, deadly, saliva, from, the, mouth, of, a, rabid, bull, dog, held, on, the, table, by, two, assistants, their, hands, protected, by, leather, gloves, because, of, his, study, in, germs, pasteur, encouraged, doctors, to, sanitize, their, hands, and, equipment, before, surgery, prior, to, this, few, doctors, or, their, assistants, practiced, these, procedures, ignaz, semmelweis, and, joseph, lister, had, earlier, practiced, hand, sanitizing, in, medical, contexts, in, the, 1860s, a, french, national, hero, at, age, 55, in, 1878, pasteur, discreetly, told, his, family, to, never, reveal, his, laboratory, notebooks, to, anyone, his, family, obeyed, and, all, his, documents, were, held, and, inherited, in, secrecy, finally, in, 1964, pasteur, s, grandson, and, last, surviving, male, descendant, pasteur, vallery, radot, donated, the, papers, to, the, french, national, library, yet, the, papers, were, restricted, for, historical, studies, until, the, death, of, vallery, radot, in, 1971, the, documents, were, given, a, catalogue, number, only, in, 1985, in, 1995, the, centennial, of, the, death, of, louis, pasteur, a, historian, of, science, gerald, l, geison, published, an, analysis, of, pasteur, s, private, notebooks, in, his, the, private, science, of, louis, pasteur, and, declared, that, pasteur, had, given, several, misleading, accounts, and, played, deceptions, in, his, most, important, discoveries, max, perutz, published, a, defense, of, pasteur, in, the, new, york, review, of, books, based, on, further, examinations, of, pasteur, s, documents, french, immunologist, patrice, debr, concluded, in, his, book, louis, pasteur, 1998, that, in, spite, of, his, genius, pasteur, had, some, faults, a, book, review, states, that, debr, sometimes, finds, him, unfair, combative, arrogant, unattractive, in, attitude, inflexible, and, even, dogmatic, scientists, before, pasteur, had, studied, fermentation, in, the, 1830s, charles, cagniard, latour, friedrich, traugott, k, tzing, and, theodor, schwann, used, microscopes, to, study, yeasts, and, concluded, that, yeasts, were, living, organisms, in, 1839, justus, von, liebig, friedrich, w, hler, and, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, stated, that, yeast, was, not, an, organism, and, was, produced, when, air, acted, on, plant, juice, in, 1855, antoine, b, champ, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, university, of, montpellier, conducted, experiments, with, sucrose, solutions, and, concluded, that, water, was, the, factor, for, fermentation, he, changed, his, conclusion, in, 1858, stating, that, fermentation, was, directly, related, to, the, growth, of, moulds, which, required, air, for, growth, he, regarded, himself, as, the, first, to, show, the, role, of, microorganisms, in, fermentation, pasteur, started, his, experiments, in, 1857, and, published, his, findings, in, 1858, april, issue, of, comptes, rendus, chimie, b, champ, s, paper, appeared, in, january, issue, b, champ, noted, that, pasteur, did, not, bring, any, novel, idea, or, experiments, on, the, other, hand, b, champ, was, probably, aware, of, pasteur, s, 1857, preliminary, works, with, both, scientists, claiming, priority, on, the, discovery, a, dispute, extending, to, several, areas, lasted, throughout, their, lives, however, b, champ, was, on, the, losing, side, as, the, bmj, obituary, remarked, his, name, was, associated, with, bygone, controversies, as, to, priority, which, it, would, be, unprofitable, to, recall, b, champ, proposed, the, incorrect, theory, of, microzymes, according, to, k, l, manchester, anti, vivisectionists, and, proponents, of, alternative, medicine, promoted, b, champ, and, microzymes, unjustifiably, claiming, that, pasteur, plagiarized, b, champ, pasteur, thought, that, succinic, acid, inverted, sucrose, in, 1860, marcellin, berthelot, isolated, invertase, and, showed, that, succinic, acid, did, not, invert, sucrose, pasteur, believed, that, fermentation, was, only, due, to, living, cells, he, and, berthelot, engaged, in, a, long, argument, subject, of, vitalism, in, which, berthelot, was, vehemently, opposed, to, any, idea, of, vitalism, hans, buchner, discovered, that, zymase, not, an, enzyme, but, a, mixture, of, enzymes, catalyzed, fermentation, showing, that, fermentation, was, catalyzed, by, enzymes, within, cells, eduard, buchner, also, discovered, that, fermentation, could, take, place, outside, living, cells, pasteur, publicly, claimed, his, success, in, developing, the, anthrax, vaccine, in, 1881, however, his, admirer, turned, rival, henry, toussaint, was, the, one, who, developed, the, first, vaccine, toussaint, isolated, the, bacteria, that, caused, chicken, cholera, later, named, pasteurella, in, honour, of, pasteur, in, 1879, and, gave, samples, to, pasteur, who, used, them, for, his, own, works, on, 12, july, 1880, toussaint, presented, his, successful, result, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, using, an, attenuated, vaccine, against, anthrax, in, dogs, and, sheep, pasteur, on, grounds, of, jealousy, contested, the, discovery, by, publicly, displaying, his, vaccination, method, at, pouilly, le, fort, on, 5, may, 1881, pasteur, then, gave, a, misleading, account, of, the, preparation, of, the, anthrax, vaccine, used, in, the, experiment, he, claimed, that, he, made, a, live, vaccine, but, used, potassium, dichromate, to, inactivate, anthrax, spores, a, method, similar, to, toussaint, s, the, promotional, experiment, was, a, success, and, helped, pasteur, sell, his, products, getting, the, benefits, and, glory, pasteur, s, experiments, are, often, cited, as, against, medical, ethics, especially, on, his, vaccination, of, meister, he, did, not, have, any, experience, in, medical, practice, and, more, importantly, lacked, a, medical, license, this, is, often, cited, as, a, serious, threat, to, his, professional, and, personal, reputation, his, closest, partner, mile, roux, who, had, medical, qualifications, refused, to, participate, in, the, clinical, trial, likely, because, he, considered, it, unjust, however, pasteur, executed, vaccination, of, the, boy, under, the, close, watch, of, practising, physicians, jacques, joseph, grancher, head, of, the, paris, children, s, hospital, s, paediatric, clinic, and, alfred, vulpian, a, member, of, the, commission, on, rabies, he, was, not, allowed, to, hold, the, syringe, although, the, inoculations, were, entirely, under, his, supervision, it, was, grancher, who, was, responsible, for, the, injections, and, he, defended, pasteur, before, the, french, national, academy, of, medicine, in, the, issue, pasteur, has, also, been, criticized, for, keeping, secrecy, of, his, procedure, and, not, giving, proper, pre, clinical, trials, on, animals, pasteur, stated, that, he, kept, his, procedure, secret, in, order, to, control, its, quality, he, later, disclosed, his, procedures, to, a, small, group, of, scientists, pasteur, wrote, that, he, had, successfully, vaccinated, 50, rabid, dogs, before, using, it, on, meister, according, to, geison, pasteur, s, laboratory, notebooks, show, that, he, had, vaccinated, only, 11, dogs, meister, never, showed, any, symptoms, of, rabies, but, the, vaccination, has, not, been, proved, to, be, the, reason, one, source, estimates, the, probability, of, meister, contracting, rabies, at, 10, pasteur, was, awarded, 1, 500, francs, in, 1853, by, the, pharmaceutical, society, for, the, synthesis, of, racemic, acid, in, 1856, the, royal, society, of, london, presented, him, the, rumford, medal, for, his, discovery, of, the, nature, of, racemic, acid, and, its, relations, to, polarized, light, and, the, copley, medal, in, 1874, for, his, work, on, fermentation, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1869, the, french, academy, of, sciences, awarded, pasteur, the, 1859, montyon, prize, for, experimental, physiology, in, 1860, and, the, jecker, prize, in, 1861, and, the, alhumbert, prize, in, 1862, for, his, experimental, refutation, of, spontaneous, generation, though, he, lost, elections, in, 1857, and, 1861, for, membership, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, he, won, the, 1862, election, for, membership, to, the, mineralogy, section, he, was, elected, to, permanent, secretary, of, the, physical, science, section, of, the, academy, in, 1887, and, held, the, position, until, 1889, in, 1873, pasteur, was, elected, to, the, acad, mie, nationale, de, m, decine, and, was, made, the, commander, in, the, brazilian, order, of, the, rose, in, 1881, he, was, elected, to, a, seat, at, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, left, vacant, by, mile, littr, pasteur, received, the, albert, medal, from, the, royal, society, of, arts, in, 1882, in, 1883, he, became, foreign, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in,

was, designed, by, harriet, g, moore, and, cast, in, 1984, by, artworks, foundry, the, unesco, institut, pasteur, medal, was, created, on, the, centenary, of, pasteur, s, death, and, is, given, every, two, years, in, his, name, in, recognition, of, outstanding, research, contributing, to, a, beneficial, impact, on, human, health, the, french, academician, henri, mondor, stated, louis, pasteur, was, neither, a, physician, nor, a, surgeon, but, no, one, has, done, as, much, for, medicine, and, surgery, as, he, has, after, developing, the, rabies, vaccine, pasteur, proposed, an, institute, for, the, vaccine, in, 1887, fundraising, for, the, pasteur, institute, began, with, donations, from, many, countries, the, official, statute, was, registered, in, 1887, stating, that, the, institute, s, purposes, were, the, treatment, of, rabies, according, to, the, method, developed, by, m, pasteur, and, the, study, of, virulent, and, contagious, diseases, the, institute, was, inaugurated, on, 14, november, 1888, he, brought, together, scientists, with, various, specialties, the, first, five, departments, were, directed, by, two, graduates, of, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, mile, duclaux, general, microbiology, research, and, charles, chamberland, microbe, research, applied, to, hygiene, as, well, as, a, biologist, lie, metchnikoff, morphological, microbe, research, and, two, physicians, jacques, joseph, grancher, rabies, and, mile, roux, technical, microbe, research, one, year, after, the, inauguration, of, the, institute, roux, set, up, the, first, course, of, microbiology, ever, taught, in, the, world, then, entitled, cours, de, microbie, technique, course, of, microbe, research, techniques, since, 1891, the, pasteur, institute, had, been, extended, to, different, countries, and, currently, there, are, 32, institutes, in, 29, countries, in, various, parts, of, the, world, pasteur, married, marie, pasteur, n, e, laurent, in, 1849, she, was, the, daughter, of, the, rector, of, the, university, of, strasbourg, and, was, pasteur, s, scientific, assistant, they, had, five, children, together, three, of, whom, died, as, children, their, eldest, daughter, jeanne, was, born, in, 1850, she, died, from, typhoid, fever, aged, 9, whilst, at, the, boarding, school, arbois, in, 1859, in, 1865, 2, year, old, camille, died, of, a, liver, tumour, shortly, after, they, decided, to, bring, c, cile, home, from, boarding, school, but, she, too, died, of, typhoid, fever, on, 23, may, 1866, at, the, age, of, 12, only, jean, baptiste, b, 1851, and, marie, louise, b, 1858, survived, to, adulthood, jean, baptiste, would, be, a, soldier, in, the, franco, prussian, war, between, france, and, prussia, his, grandson, louis, pasteur, vallery, radot, wrote, that, pasteur, had, kept, from, his, catholic, background, only, a, spiritualism, without, religious, practice, however, catholic, observers, often, said, that, pasteur, remained, an, ardent, christian, throughout, his, whole, life, and, his, son, in, law, wrote, in, a, biography, of, him, absolute, faith, in, god, and, in, eternity, and, a, conviction, that, the, power, for, good, given, to, us, in, this, world, will, be, continued, beyond, it, were, feelings, which, pervaded, his, whole, life, the, virtues, of, the, gospel, had, ever, been, present, to, him, full, of, respect, for, the, form, of, religion, which, had, been, that, of, his, forefathers, he, came, simply, to, it, and, naturally, for, spiritual, help, in, these, last, weeks, of, his, life, the, literary, digest, of, 18, october, 1902, gives, this, statement, from, pasteur, that, he, prayed, while, he, worked, posterity, will, one, day, laugh, at, the, foolishness, of, modern, materialistic, philosophers, the, more, i, study, nature, the, more, i, stand, amazed, at, the, work, of, the, creator, i, pray, while, i, am, engaged, at, my, work, in, the, laboratory, maurice, vallery, radot, grandson, of, the, brother, of, the, son, in, law, of, pasteur, and, outspoken, catholic, also, holds, that, pasteur, fundamentally, remained, catholic, according, to, both, pasteur, vallery, radot, and, maurice, vallery, radot, the, following, well, known, quotation, attributed, to, pasteur, is, apocryphal, the, more, i, know, the, more, nearly, is, my, faith, that, of, the, breton, peasant, could, i, but, know, all, i, would, have, the, faith, of, a, breton, peasant, s, wife, according, to, maurice, vallery, radot, the, false, quotation, appeared, for, the, first, time, shortly, after, the, death, of, pasteur, however, despite, his, belief, in, god, it, has, been, said, that, his, views, were, that, of, a, freethinker, rather, than, a, catholic, a, spiritual, more, than, a, religious, man, he, was,
