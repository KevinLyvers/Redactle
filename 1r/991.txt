adr, ad, d, n, mu, ammad, sh, r, z, more, commonly, known, as, mull, adr, persian, arabic, c, 1571, 2, c, 1635, 40, ce, 980, 1050, ah, was, a, persian, twelver, shi, i, islamic, mystic, philosopher, theologian, and, lim, who, led, the, iranian, cultural, renaissance, in, the, 17th, century, according, to, oliver, leaman, mulla, sadra, is, arguably, the, single, most, important, and, influential, philosopher, in, the, muslim, world, in, the, last, four, hundred, years, though, not, its, founder, he, is, considered, the, master, of, the, illuminationist, or, ishraghi, or, ishraqi, school, of, philosophy, a, seminal, figure, who, synthesized, the, many, tracts, of, the, islamic, golden, age, philosophies, into, what, he, called, the, transcendent, theosophy, or, al, hikmah, al, muta, liyah, mulla, sadra, brought, a, new, philosophical, insight, in, dealing, with, the, nature, of, reality, and, created, a, major, transition, from, essentialism, to, existentialism, in, islamic, philosophy, although, his, existentialism, should, not, be, too, readily, compared, to, western, existentialism, his, was, a, question, of, existentialist, cosmology, as, it, pertained, to, god, and, thus, differs, considerably, from, the, individual, moral, and, or, social, questions, at, the, heart, of, russian, french, german, or, american, existentialism, mulla, sadra, s, philosophy, ambitiously, synthesized, avicennism, shahab, al, din, suhrawardi, s, illuminationist, philosophy, ibn, arabi, s, sufi, metaphysics, and, the, theology, of, the, sunni, ash, ari, school, of, kalam, into, the, framework, of, twelver, shi, ism, his, main, work, is, the, transcendent, philosophy, of, the, four, journeys, of, the, intellect, or, simply, four, journeys, in, which, he, attempted, to, reach, sufism, and, prove, the, idea, of, unity, of, existence, by, offering, a, new, intake, and, perspective, on, peripatetic, philosophy, that, was, offered, by, alpharabius, and, avicenna, in, the, islamic, world, mulla, sadra, was, born, in, shiraz, iran, to, a, notable, family, of, court, officials, in, 1571, or, 1572, in, mulla, sadra, s, time, the, safavid, dynasty, governed, over, iran, safavid, kings, granted, independence, to, fars, province, which, was, ruled, by, the, king, s, brother, mulla, sadra, s, father, khwajah, ibrahim, qavami, who, was, a, knowledgeable, and, extremely, faithful, politician, as, the, ruler, of, the, vast, region, of, fars, province, khwajah, was, rich, and, held, a, high, position, when, mulla, sadra, was, born, the, family, named, him, muhammad, but, called, him, sadra, years, later, sadra, was, nicknamed, mulla, that, is, great, scientist, sadra, was, khwajah, s, only, child, in, that, time, it, was, customary, that, the, children, of, aristocrats, were, educated, by, private, teachers, in, their, own, palace, sadra, was, a, very, intelligent, strict, energetic, studious, and, curious, boy, and, mastered, all, the, lessons, related, to, persian, and, arabic, literature, as, well, as, the, art, of, calligraphy, during, a, very, short, time, following, old, traditions, of, his, time, and, before, the, age, of, puberty, he, also, learned, horse, riding, hunting, and, fighting, techniques, mathematics, astronomy, some, medicine, jurisprudence, and, islamic, law, however, he, was, mainly, attracted, to, philosophy, and, particularly, to, mystical, philosophy, and, gnosis, in, 1591, mulla, sadra, moved, to, qazvin, and, then, in, 1597, to, isfahan, to, pursue, a, traditional, and, institutional, education, in, philosophy, theology, hadith, and, hermeneutics, at, that, time, each, city, was, a, successive, capital, of, the, safavid, dynasty, and, the, center, of, twelver, shi, ite, seminaries, sadra, s, teachers, included, mir, damad, and, baha, ad, din, al, amili, mulla, sadra, became, a, master, of, the, science, of, his, time, in, his, own, view, the, most, important, of, these, was, philosophy, in, qazvin, sadra, acquired, most, of, his, scholarly, knowledge, from, two, prominent, teachers, namely, baha, ad, din, al, amili, and, mir, damad, whom, he, accompanied, when, the, safavid, capital, was, transferred, from, qazvin, to, isfahan, in, 1596, ce, 1006, ah, shaykh, baha, was, an, expert, in, islamic, sciences, but, also, a, master, of, astronomy, theoretical, mathematics, engineering, architecture, medicine, and, some, fields, of, secret, knowledge, mir, damad, also, knew, the, science, of, his, time, but, limited, his, domain, to, jurisprudence, hadith, and, mainly, philosophy, mir, damad, was, a, master, of, both, the, peripatetic, aristotelian, and, illuminationist, schools, of, islamic, philosophy, mulla, sadra, obtained, most, of, his, knowledge, of, philosophy, and, gnosis, from, damad, and, always, introduced, damad, as, his, true, teacher, and, spiritual, guide, after, he, had, finished, his, studies, sadra, began, to, explore, unorthodox, doctrines, and, as, a, result, was, both, condemned, and, excommunicated, by, some, shi, i, ulam, he, then, retired, for, a, lengthy, period, of, time, to, a, village, named, kahak, near, qom, where, he, engaged, in, contemplative, exercises, while, in, kahak, he, wrote, a, number, of, minor, works, including, the, ris, la, fi, l, ashr, and, the, ris, la, f, ud, th, al, lam, in, 1612, ali, quli, khan, son, of, all, hwird, h, n, and, the, powerful, governor, of, f, rs, asked, mulla, sadra, to, abandon, his, exile, and, to, come, back, to, shiraz, to, teach, and, run, a, newly, bulit, madrasa, khan, school, persian, mulla, sadra, devoted, his, rest, of, life, to, teach, the, intellectual, sciences, particularly, his, own, teachings, transcendent, theosophy, during, his, time, in, sh, r, z, adr, began, writing, treatises, that, synthesized, wide, ranging, strands, of, existing, islamic, systems, of, thought, at, khan, school, the, ideas, of, his, school, which, may, be, seen, as, a, continuation, of, the, school, of, i, fah, n, of, m, r, d, m, d, and, shaykh, bah, were, promulgated, after, sadr, s, death, by, his, pupils, several, of, whom, would, become, sought, after, thinkers, in, their, own, right, such, as, mull, mu, sin, fay, k, sh, n, mulla, sadra, s, son, in, law, and, abd, razz, l, hidj, although, adr, s, influence, remained, limited, in, the, generations, after, his, death, it, increased, markedly, during, the, 19th, century, when, his, ideas, helped, inspire, a, renewed, akhb, r, tendency, within, twelver, sh, ism, in, recent, times, his, works, have, been, studied, in, iran, europe, and, america, he, died, in, basra, after, the, hajj, and, was, buried, in, the, present, day, city, of, najaf, iraq, although, existentialism, as, defined, nowadays, is, not, identical, to, mulla, sadra, s, definition, he, was, the, first, to, introduce, the, concept, according, to, mulla, sadra, existence, precedes, the, essence, and, is, thus, principal, since, something, has, to, exist, first, and, then, have, an, essence, it, is, notable, that, for, mulla, sadra, this, was, an, issue, that, applied, specifically, to, god, and, god, s, position, in, the, universe, especially, in, the, context, of, reconciling, god, s, position, in, the, qur, an, with, the, greek, influenced, cosmological, philosophies, of, islam, s, golden, era, mulla, sadra, s, metaphysics, gives, priority, to, existence, over, essence, i, e, quiddity, that, is, to, say, essences, are, variable, and, are, determined, according, to, existential, intensity, to, use, henry, corbin, s, definition, thus, essences, are, not, immutable, the, advantage, to, this, schema, is, that, it, is, acceptable, to, the, fundamental, statements, of, the, qur, an, even, as, it, does, not, necessarily, undermine, any, previous, islamic, philosopher, s, aristotelian, or, platonic, foundations, indeed, mulla, sadra, provides, immutability, only, to, god, while, intrinsically, linking, essence, and, existence, to, each, other, and, to, god, s, power, over, existence, in, so, doing, he, provided, for, god, s, authority, over, all, things, while, also, solving, the, problem, of, god, s, knowledge, of, particulars, including, those, that, are, evil, without, being, inherently, responsible, for, them, even, as, god, s, authority, over, the, existence, of, things, that, provide, the, framework, for, evil, to, exist, this, clever, solution, provides, for, freedom, of, will, god, s, supremacy, the, infiniteness, of, god, s, knowledge, the, existence, of, evil, and, definitions, of, existence, and, essence, that, leave, the, two, inextricably, linked, insofar, as, humans, are, concerned, but, fundamentally, separate, insofar, as, god, is, concerned, perhaps, most, importantly, the, primacy, of, existence, provides, the, capacity, for, god, s, judgement, without, god, being, directly, or, indirectly, affected, by, the, evil, being, judged, god, does, not, need, to, possess, sin, to, know, sin, god, is, able, to, judge, the, intensity, of, sin, as, god, perceives, existence, one, result, of, sadra, s, existentialism, is, the, unity, of, the, intellect, and, the, intelligible, arabic, ittihad, al, aaqil, wa, l, maqul, as, henry, corbin, describes, all, the, levels, of, the, modes, of, being, and, perception, are, governed, by, the, same, law, of, unity, which, at, the, level, of, the, intelligible, world, is, the, unity, of, intellection, of, the, intelligizing, subject, and, of, the, form, intelligized, the, same, unity, as, that, of, love, lover, and, beloved, within, this, perspective, we, can, perceive, what, sadra, meant, by, the, unitive, union, of, the, human, soul, in, the, supreme, awareness, of, its, acts, of, knowledge, with, the, active, intelligence, which, is, the, holy, spirit, it, is, never, a, question, of, an, arithmetical, unity, but, of, an, intelligible, unity, permitting, the, reciprocity, which, allows, us, to, understand, that, in, the, soul, which, it, metamorphoses, the, form, or, idea, intelligized, by, the, active, intelligence, is, a, form, which, intelligizes, itself, and, that, as, a, result, the, active, intelligence, or, holy, spirit, intelligizes, itself, in, the, soul, s, act, of, intellection, reciprocally, the, soul, as, a, form, intelligizing, itself, intelligizes, itself, as, a, form, intelligized, by, the, active, intelligence, another, central, concept, of, mulla, sadra, s, philosophy, is, the, theory, of, substantial, motion, arabic, al, harakat, al, jawhariyyah, which, is, based, on, the, premise, that, everything, in, the, order, of, nature, including, celestial, spheres, undergoes, substantial, change, and, transformation, as, a, result, of, the, self, flow, sarayan, al, wujud, and, penetration, of, being, fayd, which, gives, every, concrete, individual, entity, its, share, of, being, in, contrast, to, aristotle, and, avicenna, who, had, accepted, change, only, in, four, categories, i, e, quantity, kamm, quality, kayf, position, wad, and, place, ayn, sadra, defines, change, as, an, all, pervasive, reality, running, through, the, entire, cosmos, including, the, category, of, substance, jawhar, mulla, sadra, held, the, view, that, reality, is, existence, he, believed, that, an, essence, was, by, itself, a, general, notion, and, therefore, does, not, in, reality, exist, to, paraphrase, fazlur, rahman, on, mulla, sadra, s, existential, cosmology, existence, is, the, one, and, only, reality, existence, and, reality, are, therefore, identical, existence, is, the, all, comprehensive, reality, and, there, is, nothing, outside, of, it, essences, which, are, negative, require, some, sort, of, reality, and, therefore, exist, existence, therefore, cannot, be, denied, therefore, existence, cannot, be, negated, as, existence, cannot, be, negated, it, is, self, evident, that, existence, is, god, god, should, not, be, searched, for, in, the, realm, of, existence, but, is, the, basis, of, all, existence, reality, in, arabic, is, al, haq, and, is, stated, in, the, qur, an, as, one, of, the, names, of, god, to, paraphrase, mulla, sadra, s, logical, proof, for, god, sadra, argued, that, all, contingent, beings, require, a, cause, which, puts, their, balance, between, existence, and, non, existence, in, favor, of, the, former, nothing, can, come, into, existence, without, a, cause, since, the, world, is, therefore, contingent, upon, this, first, act, not, only, must, god, exist, but, god, must, also, be, responsible, for, this, first, act, of, creation, sadra, also, believed, that, a, causal, regress, was, impossible, because, the, causal, chain, could, work, only, in, the, matter, that, had, a, beginning, middle, and, end, the, causal, nexus, of, mulla, sadra, was, a, form, of, existential, ontology, within, a, cosmological, framework, that, islam, supported, for, mulla, sadra, the, causal, end, is, as, pure, as, its, corresponding, beginning, which, instructively, places, god, at, both, the, beginning, and, the, end, of, the, creative, act, god, s, capacity, to, measure, the, intensity, of, existential, reality, by, measuring, causal, dynamics, and, their, relationship, to, their, origin, as, opposed, to, knowing, their, effects, provided, the, islamically, acceptable, framework, for, god, s, judgement, of, reality, without, being, tainted, by, its, particulars, this, was, a, solution, to, a, question, that, had, haunted, islamic, philosophy, for, almost, one, thousand, years, how, is, god, able, to, judge, sin, without, knowing, sin, for, mulla, sadra, a, true, statement, is, a, statement, that, is, true, to, the, concrete, facts, in, existence, he, held, a, metaphysical, and, not, a, formal, idea, of, truth, claiming, that, the, world, consists, of, mind, independent, objects, that, are, always, true, and, truth, is, not, what, is, rationally, acceptable, within, a, certain, theory, of, description, in, mulla, sadra, s, view, one, cannot, have, access, to, the, reality, of, being, only, linguistic, analysis, is, available, this, theory, of, truth, has, two, levels, the, claim, that, a, proposition, is, true, if, it, corresponds, to, things, in, reality, and, that, a, proposition, can, be, true, if, it, conforms, with, the, actual, thing, itself, mulla, sadra, s, commemoration, day, persian, is, annually, held, in, iran, at, the, first, of, khordad, the, third, month, of, the, solar, hijri, calendar, on, the, other, hand, this, day, 1st, khordad, has, been, registered, among, the, occasions, of, iranian, calendars
