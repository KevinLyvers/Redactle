21, revolutions, the, first, government, of, the, republic, lasted, less, than, 10, weeks, and, the, longest, ruling, government, lasted, little, over, a, year, revolution, in, portugal, became, a, byword, in, europe, the, cost, of, living, increased, twenty, fivefold, while, the, currency, fell, to, a, 1, 33, part, of, its, gold, value, portugal, s, public, finances, entered, a, critical, phase, having, been, under, imminent, threat, of, default, since, at, least, the, 1890s, the, gaps, between, the, rich, and, the, poor, continued, to, widen, the, regime, led, portugal, to, enter, world, war, i, in, 1916, a, move, that, only, aggravated, the, perilous, state, of, affairs, in, the, country, concurrently, the, catholic, church, was, hounded, by, the, anti, clerical, freemasons, of, the, republic, and, political, assassination, and, terrorism, became, commonplace, between, 1920, and, 1925, according, to, official, police, figures, 325, bombs, burst, in, the, streets, of, lisbon, the, british, diplomat, sir, george, rendel, said, that, he, could, not, describe, the, political, background, as, anything, but, deplorable, very, different, from, the, orderly, prosperous, and, well, managed, country, that, it, later, became, under, the, government, of, senhor, salazar, salazar, would, keep, in, mind, the, political, chaos, of, this, time, when, he, later, ruled, portugal, public, discontent, led, to, the, 28, may, 1926, coup, d, tat, which, was, welcomed, by, most, civilian, classes, at, the, time, the, prevailing, view, in, portugal, was, that, political, parties, were, elements, of, division, and, that, parliamentarianism, was, in, crisis, this, led, to, general, support, or, at, least, tolerance, of, an, authoritarian, regime, as, a, young, man, salazar, s, involvement, in, politics, stemmed, from, his, catholic, views, which, were, aroused, by, the, new, anti, clerical, stance, of, the, first, republic, he, became, a, member, of, the, non, politically, affiliated, catholic, movement, centro, acad, mico, de, democracia, crist, academic, centre, for, christian, democracy, salazar, rejected, the, monarchists, because, he, felt, that, they, were, opposed, to, the, social, doctrines, espoused, by, pope, leo, xiii, to, which, it, is, said, he, was, very, sympathetic, despite, the, fact, that, they, were, contrary, to, his, actions, he, was, a, frequent, contributor, to, journals, concerned, with, social, studies, especially, the, weekly, o, imparcial, which, was, directed, by, his, friend, and, later, cardinal, patriarch, of, lisbon, manuel, gon, alves, cerejeira, local, press, described, him, as, one, of, the, most, powerful, minds, of, the, new, generation, in, 1921, salazar, was, persuaded, to, stand, as, a, candidate, for, election, to, parliament, though, he, did, so, reluctantly, he, appeared, once, in, the, chamber, and, never, returned, struck, by, the, disorder, he, witnessed, and, a, feeling, of, futility, salazar, was, convinced, that, liberal, individualism, had, led, to, fragmentation, of, society, and, a, perversion, of, the, democratic, process, after, the, coup, d, tat, of, 28, may, 1926, which, established, the, ditadura, nacional, regime, salazar, briefly, joined, the, government, of, jos, mendes, cabe, adas, as, minister, of, finance, on, 11, june, a, small, group, of, officers, drove, from, lisbon, to, santa, comba, d, o, to, persuade, him, to, be, minister, of, finance, salazar, spent, five, days, in, lisbon, the, conditions, he, proposed, to, control, spending, were, refused, he, quickly, resigned, and, in, two, hours, he, was, on, a, train, back, to, coimbra, university, explaining, that, because, of, the, frequent, disputes, and, general, disorder, in, the, government, he, could, not, do, his, work, properly, portugal, s, overriding, problem, in, 1926, was, its, enormous, public, debt, much, of, which, was, owed, to, foreign, entities, several, times, between, 1926, and, 1928, salazar, turned, down, appointment, to, the, finance, ministry, he, pleaded, ill, health, devotion, to, his, aged, parents, and, a, preference, for, the, academic, cloisters, in, 1927, under, the, ministry, of, sinel, de, cordes, the, public, deficit, kept, on, growing, the, government, tried, to, obtain, loans, from, baring, brothers, under, the, auspices, of, the, league, of, nations, but, the, conditions, were, considered, unacceptable, with, portugal, under, the, threat, of, an, imminent, financial, collapse, salazar, finally, agreed, to, become, its, 81st, finance, minister, on, 26, april, 1928, after, the, republican, and, freemason, scar, carmona, was, elected, president, however, before, accepting, the, position, he, personally, secured, from, carmona, a, categorical, assurance, that, as, finance, minister, he, would, have, a, free, hand, to, veto, expenditure, in, all, government, departments, not, just, his, own, salazar, was, the, financial, czar, virtually, from, the, day, he, took, office, within, one, year, armed, with, special, powers, salazar, balanced, the, budget, and, stabilised, portugal, s, currency, salazar, produced, the, first, of, many, budgetary, surpluses, in, portugal, in, july, 1929, salazar, again, presented, his, resignation, his, friend, m, rio, de, figueiredo, minister, of, justice, passed, new, legislation, that, facilitated, the, organisation, of, religious, processions, the, new, law, outraged, the, republicans, triggered, a, cabinet, crisis, and, figueiredo, threatened, to, resign, salazar, advised, figueiredo, against, resigning, but, told, his, friend, he, would, join, him, in, his, decision, figueiredo, did, resign, and, salazar, at, that, time, hospitalised, due, to, a, broken, leg, followed, suit, on, 3, july, carmona, went, personally, to, the, hospital, on, the, 4th, and, asked, salazar, to, change, his, mind, prime, minister, jos, vicente, de, freitas, who, took, issue, with, carmona, s, policies, left, the, cabinet, salazar, remained, in, the, cabinet, as, minister, of, finance, but, with, additional, powers, salazar, stayed, on, as, finance, minister, while, military, prime, ministers, came, and, went, from, his, first, successful, year, in, office, he, gradually, came, to, embody, the, financial, and, political, solution, to, the, turmoil, of, the, military, dictatorship, which, had, not, produced, a, clear, leader, finally, on, 5, july, 1932, president, carmona, appointed, salazar, as, the, 100th, prime, minister, of, portugal, after, which, he, began, to, operate, closer, to, the, mainstream, of, political, sentiment, in, his, country, the, authoritarian, government, consisted, of, a, right, wing, coalition, and, he, was, able, to, co, opt, the, moderates, of, each, political, current, with, the, aid, of, censorship, and, repression, directed, against, those, outside, of, it, those, perceived, to, be, genuine, fascists, were, jailed, or, exiled, conservative, catholics, were, salazar, s, earliest, and, most, loyal, supporters, whereas, conservative, republicans, who, could, not, be, co, opted, became, his, most, dangerous, opponents, during, the, early, period, they, attempted, several, coups, but, never, presented, a, united, front, consequently, these, attempts, were, easily, repressed, never, a, true, monarchist, salazar, nevertheless, gained, most, of, the, monarchists, support, as, manuel, ii, of, portugal, the, exiled, and, deposed, last, king, of, portugal, always, endorsed, salazar, later, in, 1932, it, was, due, to, salazar, s, actions, that, the, deposed, king, was, given, a, state, funeral, the, national, syndicalists, were, torn, between, supporting, the, regime, and, denouncing, it, as, bourgeois, they, were, granted, enough, symbolic, concessions, for, salazar, to, win, over, the, moderates, but, the, rest, were, repressed, by, the, political, police, salazar, based, his, political, philosophy, on, a, close, interpretation, of, the, catholic, social, doctrine, much, like, the, contemporary, regime, of, engelbert, dollfuss, in, austria, the, economic, system, known, as, corporatism, was, alleged, to, be, based, on, similar, interpretations, of, the, papal, encyclicals, rerum, novarum, leo, xiii, 1891, and, quadragesimo, anno, pius, xi, 1931, which, were, meant, to, prevent, class, struggle, and, transform, economic, concerns, secondary, to, social, values, rerum, novarum, argued, that, labor, associations, were, part, of, the, natural, order, like, the, family, the, right, of, men, to, organise, into, trade, unions, and, to, engage, in, collective, bargaining, was, thus, inherent, and, could, not, be, denied, by, employers, or, the, state, quadragesimo, anno, provided, the, blue, print, for, the, erection, of, the, corporatist, system, but, the, practice, was, that, stability, of, the, regime, was, maintained, by, suppressing, human, rights, and, liberties, a, new, constitution, was, drafted, by, a, group, of, lawyers, businessmen, clerics, and, university, professors, with, salazar, the, leading, spirit, and, marcelo, caetano, also, playing, a, major, role, the, constitution, created, the, estado, novo, new, state, in, theory, a, corporatist, state, representing, interest, groups, rather, than, individuals, he, wanted, a, system, in, which, the, people, would, be, represented, through, corporations, rather, than, through, political, parties, and, where, national, interest, was, given, priority, over, sectional, claims, salazar, thought, that, the, party, system, had, failed, irrevocably, in, portugal, unlike, mussolini, or, hitler, salazar, never, had, the, intention, to, create, a, party, state, salazar, was, against, the, whole, party, concept, and, in, 1930, he, created, the, national, union, a, single, party, which, he, marketed, as, a, non, party, announcing, that, the, national, union, would, be, the, antithesis, of, a, political, party, the, national, union, became, an, ancillary, body, not, a, source, of, political, power, the, national, union, was, set, up, to, control, and, restrain, public, opinion, rather, than, to, mobilize, it, the, goal, was, to, strengthen, and, preserve, traditional, values, rather, than, to, induce, a, new, social, order, at, no, stage, did, it, appear, that, salazar, wished, it, to, fulfill, the, central, role, the, fascist, party, had, acquired, in, mussolini, s, italy, in, fact, it, was, meant, to, be, a, platform, of, conservatism, not, a, revolutionary, vanguard, ministers, diplomats, and, civil, servants, were, never, compelled, to, join, the, national, union, portuguese, historian, ernesto, c, leal, described, salazar, s, ideology, as, eclectic, and, syncretic, and, primarily, representing, a, combination, of, authoritarian, nationalist, conservative, and, anti, liberal, tendencies, according, to, leal, the, most, unique, characteristic, of, salazar, s, political, thinking, was, christian, corporatism, and, social, corporatism, as, well, as, his, inclusion, of, both, reformist, and, traditionalist, currents, the, legislature, called, the, assembleia, nacional, was, restricted, to, members, of, the, national, union, it, could, initiate, legislation, but, only, concerning, matters, that, did, not, require, government, expenditures, the, parallel, corporative, chamber, included, representatives, of, municipalities, religious, cultural, and, professional, groups, and, of, the, official, workers, syndicates, that, replaced, free, trade, unions, the, new, constitution, introduced, by, salazar, established, an, anti, parliamentarian, and, authoritarian, government, that, would, last, until, 1974, the, president, was, to, be, elected, by, popular, vote, for, a, period, of, seven, years, on, paper, the, new, document, vested, sweeping, almost, dictatorial, powers, in, the, hands, of, the, president, including, the, power, to, appoint, and, dismiss, the, prime, minister, the, president, was, elevated, to, a, position, of, preeminence, as, the, balance, wheel, the, defender, and, ultimate, arbiter, of, national, politics, president, carmona, however, had, allowed, salazar, more, or, less, a, free, hand, since, appointing, him, prime, minister, and, continued, to, do, so, carmona, and, his, successors, would, largely, be, figureheads, as, he, wielded, the, true, power, howard, j, wiarda, argues, that, salazar, achieved, his, position, of, power, not, just, because, of, constitutional, stipulations, but, also, because, of, his, character, domineering, absolutist, ambitious, hardworking, and, intellectually, brilliant, the, corporatist, constitution, was, approved, in, the, national, portuguese, constitutional, referendum, of, 19, march, 1933, a, draft, had, been, published, one, year, before, and, the, public, was, invited, to, state, any, objections, in, the, press, these, tended, to, stay, in, the, realm, of, generalities, and, only, a, handful, of, people, less, than, 6, 000, voted, against, the, new, constitution, the, new, constitution, was, approved, with, 99, 5, of, the, vote, but, with, 488, 840, abstentions, in, a, registered, electorate, of, 1, 330, 258, counting, as, yes, hugh, kay, points, out, that, the, large, number, of, abstentions, might, be, attributable, to, the, fact, that, voters, were, presented, with, a, package, deal, to, which, they, had, to, say, yes, or, no, with, no, opportunity, to, accept, one, clause, and, reject, another, in, this, referendum, women, were, allowed, to, vote, for, the, first, time, in, portugal, their, right, to, vote, had, not, been, obtained, during, the, first, republic, despite, feminist, efforts, and, even, in, the, referendum, vote, secondary, education, was, a, requirement, for, female, voters, whereas, males, only, needed, to, be, able, to, read, and, write, the, year, 1933, marked, a, watershed, in, portuguese, history, under, salazar, s, supervision, teot, nio, pereira, the, sub, secretary, of, state, of, corporations, and, social, welfare, reporting, directly, to, salazar, enacted, extensive, legislation, that, shaped, the, corporatist, structure, and, initiated, a, comprehensive, social, welfare, system, this, system, was, equally, anti, capitalist, and, anti, socialist, the, corporatisation, of, the, working, class, was, accompanied, by, strict, legislation, regulating, business, workers, organisations, were, subordinated, to, state, control, but, granted, a, legitimacy, that, they, had, never, before, enjoyed, and, were, made, beneficiaries, of, a, variety, of, new, social, programs, nevertheless, it, is, important, to, note, that, even, in, the, enthusiastic, early, years, corporatist, agencies, were, not, at, the, centre, of, power, and, therefore, corporatism, was, not, the, true, base, of, the, whole, system, in, 1934, salazar, exiled, francisco, rol, o, preto, as, a, part, of, a, purge, of, the, leadership, of, the, portuguese, national, syndicalists, also, known, as, the, camisas, azuis, blue, shirts, salazar, denounced, the, national, syndicalists, as, inspired, by, certain, foreign, models, meaning, german, nazism, and, condemned, their, exaltation, of, youth, the, cult, of, force, through, direct, action, the, principle, of, the, superiority, of, state, political, power, in, social, life, the, propensity, for, organising, masses, behind, a, single, leader, as, fundamental, differences, between, fascism, and, the, catholic, corporatism, of, the, estado, novo, salazar, s, own, party, the, national, union, was, formed, as, a, subservient, umbrella, organisation, to, support, the, regime, itself, and, therefore, did, not, have, its, own, philosophy, at, the, time, according, to, kay, many, european, countries, feared, what, he, described, as, the, destructive, potential, of, communism, salazar, not, only, forbade, marxist, parties, but, also, revolutionary, fascist, syndicalist, parties, one, overriding, criticism, of, his, regime, is, that, stability, was, bought, and, maintained, at, the, expense, of, suppression, of, human, rights, and, liberties, the, corporatist, state, had, some, similarities, to, italian, fascism, and, the, original, corporativismo, of, benito, mussolini, but, considerable, differences, in, its, moral, approach, to, governing, although, salazar, admired, mussolini, and, was, influenced, by, his, labour, charter, of, 1927, he, distanced, himself, from, fascist, dictatorship, which, he, considered, a, pagan, caesarist, political, system, that, recognised, neither, legal, nor, moral, limits, salazar, also, viewed, german, nazism, as, espousing, pagan, elements, that, he, considered, repugnant, just, before, world, war, ii, salazar, made, this, declaration, we, are, opposed, to, all, forms, of, internationalism, communism, socialism, syndicalism, and, everything, that, may, divide, or, minimise, or, break, up, the, family, we, are, against, class, warfare, irreligion, and, disloyalty, to, one, s, country, against, serfdom, a, materialistic, conception, of, life, and, might, over, right, scholars, such, as, stanley, g, payne, thomas, gerard, gallagher, juan, jos, linz, ant, nio, costa, pinto, roger, griffin, robert, paxton, and, howard, j, wiarda, prefer, to, consider, the, portuguese, estado, novo, as, conservative, authoritarian, rather, than, fascist, on, the, other, hand, some, portuguese, scholars, like, fernando, rosas, manuel, villaverde, cabral, manuel, de, lucena, and, manuel, loff, think, that, the, estado, novo, should, be, considered, fascist, stanley, g, payne, wrote, that, salazar, s, system, might, best, be, described, as, one, of, authoritarian, corporatism, or, even, authoritarian, corporative, liberalism, rather, than, fascism, historian, juan, jos, linz, says, that, fascism, never, took, roots, in, salazar, portugal, the, estado, novo, of, portugal, differed, from, fascism, even, more, profoundly, than, franco, s, spain, salazar, was, in, effect, the, dictator, of, portugal, but, he, preferred, a, passive, public, and, a, limited, state, where, social, power, remained, in, the, hands, of, the, church, the, army, and, the, big, landowners, samuel, hoare, the, british, ambassador, in, madrid, during, the, war, stated, that, salazar, detested, hitler, and, all, his, works, however, he, said, that, europe, owes, him, the, great, service, of, having, pushed, back, the, frontiers, of, communism, with, astonishing, energy, and, exciting, muscle, i, only, fear, that, he, will, go, too, far, in, the, economic, and, social, field, and, talking, to, a, romanian, diplomat, in, spite, of, everything, hitler, was, a, political, genius, who, had, realized, a, colossal, work, historian, robert, paxton, observes, that, one, of, the, main, problems, in, defining, fascism, is, that, it, was, widely, mimicked, he, wrote, in, fascism, s, heyday, in, the, 1930s, many, regimes, that, were, not, functionally, fascist, borrowed, elements, of, fascist, decor, in, order, to, lend, themselves, an, aura, of, force, vitality, and, mass, mobilization, he, went, on, to, observe, that, salazar, crushed, portuguese, fascism, after, he, had, copied, some, of, its, techniques, of, popular, mobilization, political, scientists, manuel, braga, da, cruz, and, philippe, schmitter, argue, that, salazar, s, regime, was, not, fascist, as, it, lacked, most, aspects, of, fascism, unlike, fascism, salazarism, had, no, anti, bourgeois, or, anti, capitalist, motivations, there, was, no, determination, of, the, state, apparatus, by, an, armed, party, and, loyalty, to, salazar, was, more, a, case, of, condescending, obedience, than, enthusiastic, support, on, the, part, of, subordinates, da, cruz, and, schmitter, also, note, that, salazarism, was, marked, by, nationalist, and, conservative, policies, rather, than, expansionist, ambitions, additionally, howard, j, wiarda, observes, that, salazar, did, not, pursue, genocidal, policies, and, while, salazar, s, portugal, was, marked, by, political, repression, it, gradually, became, less, repressive, and, eventually, opened, up, somewhat, not, to, liberalism, but, to, greater, pluralism, and, less, strict, controls, according, to, juan, jos, linz, salazar, s, portugal, was, an, authoritarian, regime, with, its, own, distinctive, politics, and, dynamics, that, was, neither, fascist, nor, totalitarian, in, his, analysis, of, the, regime, he, makes, following, points, salazar, relied, on, secret, police, to, enforce, the, policies, he, wished, to, implement, the, pol, cia, de, vigil, ncia, e, defesa, do, estado, state, surveillance, and, defense, police, was, established, in, 1933, it, was, replaced, in, 1945, by, the, remodeled, pol, cia, internacional, e, de, defesa, do, estado, pide, international, and, state, defence, police, which, lasted, until, 1969, and, from, that, year, to, 1974, under, marcelo, caetano, it, was, the, dire, o, geral, de, seguran, a, dgs, general, security, directorate, the, secret, police, existed, not, only, to, protect, national, security, in, a, modern, sense, but, also, to, monitor, the, population, apply, censorship, and, suppress, the, regime, s, political, opponents, especially, those, associated, with, the, international, communist, movement, or, the, soviet, union, political, prisoners, were, incarcerated, in, detention, centers, such, as, the, caxias, prison, near, lisbon, or, the, tarrafal, camp, on, the, cabo, verde, islands, and, tortured, the, political, police, used, a, net, of, civilian, informants, in, popular, parlance, bufos, who, were, found, in, practically, all,

to, beatings, and, torture, it, was, a, city, area, in, the, middle, of, lisbon, s, downtown, and, the, screams, could, be, heard, in, the, street, on, august, 1, 1958, the, brazilian, ambassador, herself, lvaro, lins, wife, witnessed, a, detainee, fall, from, the, third, floor, of, the, political, police, headquarters, the, spanish, civil, war, which, began, in, july, 1936, was, the, ostensible, reason, for, the, radicalisation, of, the, regime, internally, the, regime, had, to, face, a, monarchist, revolt, in, 1935, a, threatened, leftist, coup, in, 1936, and, several, bombs, and, conspiracies, in, 1936, and, 1937, including, an, attempt, to, assassinate, salazar, in, 1937, at, the, same, time, spanish, republican, agents, were, active, in, lisbon, and, spanish, troops, were, deployed, on, portugal, s, vulnerable, border, severely, threatening, portuguese, sovereignty, at, the, beginning, of, the, spanish, civil, war, salazar, took, up, additional, portfolios, as, minister, of, war, and, minister, of, foreign, affairs, while, retaining, direction, of, the, ministry, of, finance, thus, concentrating, even, more, power, in, his, hands, salazar, supported, francisco, franco, and, the, nationalists, in, their, war, against, the, second, republic, forces, as, well, as, the, anarchists, and, the, communists, the, nationalists, lacked, access, to, seaports, early, on, so, salazar, s, portugal, helped, them, receive, armaments, shipments, from, abroad, including, ordnance, when, certain, nationalist, forces, virtually, ran, out, of, ammunition, consequently, the, nationalists, called, lisbon, the, port, of, castile, later, franco, spoke, of, salazar, in, glowing, terms, in, an, interview, in, the, le, figaro, newspaper, the, most, complete, statesman, the, one, most, worthy, of, respect, that, i, have, known, is, salazar, i, regard, him, as, an, extraordinary, personality, for, his, intelligence, his, political, sense, and, his, humility, his, only, defect, is, probably, his, modesty, on, 8, september, 1936, a, naval, revolt, took, place, in, lisbon, the, crews, of, two, naval, portuguese, vessels, the, nrp, afonso, de, albuquerque, and, the, d, o, mutinied, the, sailors, who, were, affiliated, with, the, communist, party, confined, their, officers, and, attempted, to, sail, the, ships, out, of, lisbon, to, join,

civil, service, and, censorship, was, severely, tightened, every, government, functionary, was, forced, to, declare, that, he, repudiated, communism, this, crusade, aimed, to, root, out, not, only, communists, but, also, the, democratic, opposition, the, convicted, sailors, from, the, 1936, naval, revolt, were, the, first, to, be, sent, to, the, tarrafal, prison, camp, established, by, salazar, in, the, cape, verde, islands, to, house, political, prisoners, it, was, labeled, the, slow, death, camp, where, dozens, of, political, prisoners, mostly, communists, but, also, adherents, of, other, ideologies, were, imprisoned, under, inhumane, unhealthy, conditions, in, exceedingly, hot, weather, and, died, historians, say, that, 60, people, died, in, jails, for, political, reasons, during, salazar, s, nearly, 40, year, regime, in, january, 1938, salazar, appointed, pedro, teot, nio, pereira, as, special, liaison, of, the, portuguese, government, to, franco, s, government, where, he, achieved, great, prestige, and, influence, in, april, 1938, pereira, officially, become, a, full, rank, portuguese, ambassador, to, spain, and, he, remained, in, this, post, throughout, world, war, ii, just, a, few, days, before, the, end, of, the, spanish, civil, war, on, 17, march, 1939, portugal, and, spain, signed, the, iberian, pact, a, non, aggression, treaty, that, marked, the, beginning, of, a, new, phase, in, iberian, relations, meetings, between, franco, and, salazar, played, a, fundamental, role, in, this, new, political, arrangement, the, pact, proved, to, be, a, decisive, instrument, in, keeping, the, iberian, peninsula, out, of, hitler, s, continental, system, the, decisive, conservatism, of, the, regime, naturally, drew, opposition, em, dio, santana, founder, of, the, sindicato, nacional, dos, metal, rgicos, national, syndicate, of, metallurgists, and, an, anarcho, syndicalist, who, was, involved, in, clandestine, activities, against, the, dictatorship, attempted, to, assassinate, salazar, on, 4, july, 1937, salazar, was, on, his, way, to, mass, at, a, private, chapel, in, a, friend, s, house, on, barbosa, du, bocage, avenue, in, lisbon, as, he, stepped, out, of, his, buick, limousine, a, bomb, hidden, in, an, iron, case, exploded, only, 3, metres, 10, ft, away, the, blast, left, salazar, untouched, but, his, chauffeur, was, rendered, deaf, an, inept, secret, police, made, several, arrests, and, beat, five, innocent, people, till, they, confessed, a, year, later, the, bishops, of, the, country, argued, in, a, collective, letter, that,

where, he, was, arrested, by, british, police, and, returned, to, portugal, he, was, then, sentenced, to, 16, years, in, prison, salazar, had, experienced, the, social, turmoil, caused, by, world, war, i, in, which, portugal, participated, during, the, period, of, the, first, republic, world, war, ii, followed, its, course, while, he, was, in, power, salazar, was, widely, praised, for, keeping, portugal, neutral, during, the, second, world, war, from, the, war, s, very, beginning, in, 1939, salazar, was, convinced, that, britain, would, suffer, injury, but, remain, undefeated, that, the, united, states, would, step, into, the, conflict, and, that, the, allies, would, win, the, american, journalist, henry, j, taylor, commented, i, found, not, another, continental, european, leader, who, then, agreed, with, him, in, 1934, several, years, before, the, war, began, salazar, clarified, in, an, official, speech, that, portuguese, nationalism, did, not, include, the, pagan, ideal, and, anti, human, to, deify, a, race, or, empire, and, again, in, 1937, salazar, published, a, book, in, which, he, criticised, the, nuremberg, laws, passed, in, 1935, in, germany, considering, it, regrettable, that, german, nationalism, was, wrinkled, by, racial, characteristics, so, well, marked, which, had, imposed, the, legal, point, of, view, the, distinction, between, citizens, and, the, subject, and, this, at, the, risk, of, dangerous, consequences, salazar, thought, regarding, world, war, ii, that, a, german, victory, spelt, disaster, for, the, rule, of, law, and, for, peripheral, agricultural, countries, such, as, portugal, salazar, s, dislike, of, the, nazi, regime, in, germany, and, its, imperial, ambitions, was, tempered, only, by, his, view, of, the, german, reich, as, a, bastion, against, the, spread, of, communism, rather, than, an, allied, nation, he, had, favoured, the, spanish, nationalist, cause, out, of, fear, of, a, communist, invasion, of, portugal, yet, he, was, uneasy, at, the, prospect, of, a, spanish, government, bolstered, by, strong, ties, with, the, axis, powers, salazar, s, policy, of, neutrality, for, portugal, in, world, war, ii, thus, included, a, strategic, component, the, country, still, held, colonies, that, portugal, could, not, defend, from, military, attack, siding, with, the, axis, would, have, brought, portugal, into, conflict, with, britain, likely, resulting, in, the, loss, of, its, colonies, while, siding, with, the, allies, risked, the, security, of, the, home, country, on, the, mainland, a, conflict, with, britain, would, have, been, economically, costly, as, portugal, relied, on, british, transports, of, goods, from, portuguese, colonies, to, the, mainland, as, the, price, to, pay, for, remaining, neutral, portugal, continued, to, export, tungsten, and, other, commodities, to, both, the, axis, via, switzerland, partly, and, the, allied, countries, on, 1, september, 1939, at, the, start, of, world, war, ii, the, portuguese, government, announced, that, the, 600, year, old, anglo, portuguese, alliance, remained, intact, but, that, since, the, british, did, not, seek, portuguese, assistance, portugal, was, free, to, remain, neutral, in, the, war, and, would, do, so, in, an, aide, m, moire, of, 5, september, 1939, the, british, government, confirmed, the, understanding, british, strategists, regarded, portuguese, non, belligerency, as, essential, to, keep, spain, from, entering, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, axis, britain, recognised, salazar, s, important, role, on, 15, may, 1940, when, douglas, veale, registrar, of, the, university, of, oxford, informed, him, that, the, university, s, hebdomadal, council, had, unanimously, decided, at, its, meeting, last, monday, to, invite, you, to, accept, the, honorary, degree, of, doctor, of, civil, law, in, september, 1940, winston, churchill, wrote, to, salazar, to, congratulate, him, for, his, policy, of, keeping, portugal, out, of, the, war, avowing, that, as, so, often, before, during, the, many, centuries, of, the, anglo, portuguese, alliance, british, and, portuguese, interests, are, identical, on, this, vital, question, sir, samuel, hoare, the, british, ambassador, in, madrid, from, 1940, to, 1944, recognised, salazar, s, crucial, role, in, keeping, iberia, neutral, during, world, war, ii, and, lauded, him, for, it, hoare, averred, that, salazar, detested, hitler, and, all, his, works, and, that, his, corporative, state, was, fundamentally, different, from, a, nazi, or, fascist, state, with, salazar, never, leaving, a, doubt, of, his, desire, for, a, nazi, defeat, historian, carlton, hayes, a, pioneering, specialist, on, the, study, of, nationalism, was, the, american, ambassador, in, spain, during, the, war, he, met, salazar, in, person, and, also, praised, him, expressing, a, similar, opinion, to, hoare, s, in, his, book, wartime, mission, in, spain, in, november, 1943, the, british, ambassador, in, lisbon, sir, ronald, campbell, wrote, paraphrasing, salazar, that, strict, neutrality, was, the, price, the, allies, paid, for, strategic, benefits, accruing, from, portugal, s, neutrality, and, that, if, her, neutrality, instead, of, being, strict, had, been, more, benevolent, in, our, favour, spain, would, inevitably, have, thrown, herself, body, and, soul, into, the, arms, of, germany, if, this, had, happened, the, peninsula, would, have, been, occupied, and, then, north, africa, with, the, result, that, the, whole, course, of, the, war, would, have, been, altered, to, the, advantage, of, the, axis, sir, ronald, campbell, saw, salazar, as, fundamentally, loyal, to, the, anglo, portuguese, alliance, when, in, may, 1943, in, the, third, washington, conference, codenamed, trident, the, conferees, agreed, on, the, occupation, of, the, azores, operation, alacrity, the, british, ambassador, reacted, to, the, us, state, department, s, suggestion, as, particularly, ill, timed, and, incomprehensible, at, the, present, juncture, he, recalled, that, at, the, outset, of, the, war, salazar, had, remained, neutral, with, british, approval, and, stated, that, he, would, answer, the, call, if, it, were, made, on, grounds, of, dire, necessity, the, british, ambassador, was, correct, and, when, in, august, 1943, the, british, requested, military, base, facilities, in, the, azores, invoking, the, alliance, salazar, responded, favourably, and, quickly, portugal, allowed, these, bases, letting, the, british, use, the, azorean, ports, of, horta, on, the, island, of, faial, and, ponta, delgada, on, the, island, of, s, o, miguel, and, the, airfields, of, lajes, field, on, terceira, island, and, santana, field, on, s, o, miguel, island, from, november, 1943, when, the, british,

rehabilitation, use, of, lajes, field, reduced, flying, time, between, brazil, and, west, africa, from, 70, hours, to, 40, a, considerable, reduction, that, enabled, aircraft, to, make, almost, twice, as, many, crossings, clearly, demonstrating, the, geographic, value, of, the, azores, during, the, war, the, british, diplomat, sir, george, rendell, stated, that, the, portuguese, republican, government, of, bernardino, machado, was, far, more, difficult, to, deal, with, as, an, ally, during, the, first, war, than, the, infinitely, better, government, of, salazar, was, as, a, neutral, in, the, second, the, principal, reason, for, the, neutrality, of, portugal, in, world, war, ii, was, strategic, and, within, the, compass, of, the, overall, objectives, of, the, anglo, portuguese, alliance, this, modest, but, complex, role, allowed, portugal, to, rescue, a, large, number, of, war, refugees, portugal, s, official, nationalism, was, not, grounded, in, race, or, biology, salazar, argued, that, portuguese, nationalism, did, not, glorify, a, single, race, because, such, a, notion, was, pagan, and, anti, human, in, 1937, he, published, a, book, entitled, como, se, levanta, um, estado, how, to, raise, a, state, in, which, he, criticised, the, philosophical, ideals, behind, nazi, germany, s, nuremberg, laws, in, 1938, he, sent, a, telegram, to, the, portuguese, embassy, in, berlin, ordering, that, it, should, be, made, clear, to, the, german, reich, that, portuguese, law, did, not, allow, any, distinction, based, on, race, and, that, therefore, portuguese, jewish, citizens, could, not, be, discriminated, against, in, the, previous, year, adolfo, benarus, honorary, chairman, of, comassis, and, a, leader, of, the, lisbon, s, jewish, community, published, a, book, in, which, he, applauded, the, lack, of, anti, semitism, in, portugal, the, honorary, president, of, the, jewish, community, of, lisbon, claimed, in, 1937, that, happily, in, portugal, modern, anti, semitism, doesn, t, exist, in, 2011, avraham, milgram, yad, vashem, historian, said, that, modern, anti, semitism, failed, to, establish, even, a, toehold, in, portugal, while, it, grew, virulently, elsewhere, in, early, 20th, century, europe, on, 12, june, 1940, salazar, issued, instructions, to, the, portuguese, consulates, in, france, to, provide, infanta, marie, anne, of, portugal, grand, duchess, of, luxembourg, and, infanta, maria, ant, nia, of, portugal, duchess, of, parma, with, portuguese, passports, with, these, portuguese, passports, the, entire, entourage, of, the, royal, families, could, get, visas, without, creating, problems, to, the, neutrality, of, the, portuguese, government, this, way, zita, of, bourbon, parma, and, her, son, otto, von, habsburg, got, their, visas, because, they, were, descendants, of, portuguese, citizens, following, the, german, annexation, of, austria, otto, was, sentenced, to, death, by, the, nazi, regime, on, 13, june, salazar, had, to, act, fast, again, this, time, to, support, the, belgian, royal, family, salazar, sent, instructions, to, the, portuguese, consulate, in, bayonne, saying, the, portuguese, territory, is, completely, open, to, the, belgian, royal, family, and, its, entourage, on, 26, june, 1940, four, days, after, france, s, capitulation, to, germany, salazar, authorised, the, hebrew, immigrant, aid, society, hias, hicem, in, paris, to, transfer, its, main, office, to, lisbon, this, authorization, was, done, against, the, will, of, the, british, embassy, in, lisbon, the, british, feared, that, this, would, make, the, portuguese, people, less, sympathetic, with, the, allied, cause, according, to, the, lisbon, jewish, community, salazar, held, mois, s, bensabat, amzalak, the, leader, of, the, lisbon, jewish, community, in, high, esteem, and, allowed, amzalak, to, play, an, important, role, in, getting, salazar, s, permission, for, the, transfer, in, july, 1940, the, civilian, population, of, gibraltar, was, evacuated, due, to, imminent, attacks, expected, from, nazi, germany, at, that, time, portuguese, madeira, agreed, to, host, about, 2, 500, gibraltarian, refugees, mostly, women, and, children, who, arrived, at, funchal, between, 21, july, and, 13, august, 1940, and, remained, there, until, the, end, of, the, war, portugal, particularly, lisbon, was, one, of, the, last, european, exit, points, to, the, us, and, a, large, number, of, refugees, found, shelter, in, portugal, the, portuguese, consul, general, in, bordeaux, aristides, de, sousa, mendes, helped, several, and, his, actions, were, not, unique, by, any, means, issuing, visas, in, contravention, of, instructions, was, widespread, at, portuguese, consulates, all, over, europe, although, some, cases, were, supported, by, salazar, the, portuguese, ambassador, in, budapest, carlos, sampaio, garrido, helped, large, numbers, of, hungarian, jews, who, came, to, the, portuguese, diplomatic, mission, in, 1944, seeking, portuguese, protection, on, 28, april, 1944, the, gestapo, raided, the, ambassador, s, home, and, arrested, his, guests, the, ambassador, who, physically, resisted, the, police, was, also, arrested, but, managed, to, have, his, guests, released, on, the, grounds, of, extraterritoriality, of, diplomatic, legations, in, 2010, garrido, was, recognised, as, righteous, among, the, nations, by, yad, vashem, following, the, german, occupation, of, hungary, in, response, to, a, request, from, britain, and, the, united, states, who, wanted, neutral, countries, to, downgrade, their, diplomatic, presence, in, hungary, salazar, recalled, garrido, and, left, the, charg, d, affaires, carlos, de, liz, teixeira, branquinho, in, his, place, branquinho, in, close, coordination, with, salazar, issued, protective, passports, to, hundreds, of, jewish, families, and, risked, his, life, renting, houses, and, apartments, to, shelter, and, protect, the, refugees, from, deportation, and, murder, branquinho, saved, an, estimated, 1, 000, hungarian, jews, branquinho, s, case, differs, from, that, of, sousa, mendes, in, at, least, three, respects, he, was, deliberately, setting, out, to, save, jews, he, had, the, full, backing, of, the, authorities, in, lisbon, and, was, in, the, heart, of, a, nazi, regime, in, 1944, when, the, holocaust, was, at, its, peak, while, sousa, mendes, was, at, bordeaux, in, 1940, branquinho, s, name, has, been, engraved, in, the, raoul, wallenberg, memorial, at, the, doh, ny, street, synagogue, in, budapest, but, in, portugal, he, remains, largely, unknown, branquinho, was, finally, recalled, to, lisbon, on, 30, october, 1944, tom, gallagher, argues, that, branquinho, s, case, has, been, largely, overlooked, probably, because, he, was, coordinating, his, actions, with, salazar, which, weakens, the, core, argument, in, the, sousa, mendes, legend, that, he, was, defying, a, tyrannical, superior, gallagher, argues, that, the, disproportionate, attention, given, to, sousa, mendes, suggests, that, wartime, history, is, in, danger, of, being, used, in, contemporary, portugal, as, a, political, weapon, tom, gallagher, is, not, alone, in, classifying, as, disproportionate, the, attention, given, to, sousa, mendes, episode, the, portuguese, historian, diogo, ramada, curto, also, thinks, that, the, myth, of, an, aristides, who, opposed, salazar, and, capable, of, acting, individually, in, isolation, is, a, late, invention, that, rigorous, historical, analysis, does, not, confirm, other, portuguese, who, deserve, credit, for, saving, jews, during, the, war, include, professor, francisco, de, paula, leite, pinto, and, mois, s, bensabat, amzalak, a, devoted, jew, and, a, supporter, of, salazar, amzalak, headed, the,

refugees, from, berlin, and, other, european, cities, to, portugal, amzalak, was, also, able, to, persuade, salazar, to, instruct, consuls, in, territories, under, nazi, occupation, to, validate, all, passports, held, by, jews, even, though, these, documents, were, known, to, be, far, from, kosher, large, numbers, of, political, dissidents, including, abwehr, personnel, sought, refuge, in, portugal, after, the, plot, of, 20, july, 1944, to, assassinate, adolf, hitler, until, late, 1942, immigration, was, very, restricted, in, cases, in, which, refugees, were, suspected, to, desire, not, simply, to, pass, through, portugal, in, transit, to, their, destination, but, rather, intended, to, remain, in, the, country, the, consulates, needed, to, get, a, previous, authorization, from, lisbon, this, was, frequently, the, case, with, foreigners, of, indefinite, or, contested, nationality, stateless, individuals, russians, and, jews, expelled, from, their, countries, of, origin, the, number, of, refugees, who, escaped, through, portugal, during, the, war, has, been, estimated, to, range, from, a, few, hundred, thousand, to, one, million, large, numbers, considering, the, size, of, the, country, s, population, of, about, 6, million, at, that, time, after, the, war, portugal, kept, on, welcoming, and, supporting, refugees, in, an, operation, organised, by, caritas, portugal, from, 1947, to, 1952, 5, 500, austrian, children, most, of, them, orphans, were, transported, by, train, from, vienna, to, lisbon, and, then, sent, to, the, foster, care, of, portuguese, families,

members, of, his, family, were, relocated, to, the, seaside, town, of, estoril, in, the, house, address, rua, dom, afonso, henriques, 1937, 2765, 573, estoril, in, october, 1945, salazar, announced, a, liberalisation, program, designed, to, restore, civil, rights, that, had, been, suppressed, during, the, spanish, civil, war, and, world, war, ii, in, hopes, of, improving, the, image, of, his, regime, in, western, circles, the, measures, included, parliamentary, elections, general, political, amnesty, restoration, of, freedom, of, the, press, curtailment, of, legal, repression, and, a, commitment, to, introduce, the, right, of, habeas, corpus, the, opposition, started, to, organise, itself, around, a, broad, coalition, the, movement, of, democratic, unity, mud, which, ranged, from, ultra, catholics, and, fringe, elements, of, the, extreme, right, to, the, portuguese, communist, party, initially, the, mud, was, controlled, by, the, moderate, opposition, but, soon, became, strongly, influenced, by, the, communist, party, which, controlled, its, youth, wing, in, its, leadership, were, several, communists, among, them, oct, vio, pato, salgado, zenha, m, rio, soares, later, president, j, lio, pomar, and, m, rio, sacramento, this, influence, led, the, mud, to, be, outlawed, by, the, government, in, 1948, after, several, waves, of, suppression, restrictions, on, civil, liberties, that, had, been, temporarily, lifted, were, then, gradually, reinstated, as, the, cold, war, started, salazar, s, estado, novo, remained, rigidly, authoritarian, salazar, had, been, able, to, hold, onto, power, by, virtue, of, the, public, s, recollection, of, the, chaos, that, had, characterised, portuguese, life, before, 1926, however, by, the, 1950s, a, new, generation, emerged, that, had, no, collective, memory, of, this, instability, the, clearest, sign, of, this, came, in, the, portuguese, presidential, election, of, 1958, most, neutral, observers, believed, that, the, candidate, of, the, democratic, opposition, humberto, delgado, would, have, defeated, the, candidate, of, the, salazar, regime, am, rico, tom, s, had, the, election, been, conducted, fairly, delgado, was, well, aware, that, the, president, s, power, to, sack, the, prime, minister, was, theoretically, the, only, check, on, salazar, s, power, and, stated, that, if, elected, his, first, policy, would, be, to, dismiss, salazar, delgado, was, able, to, rally, support, from, a, wide, range, of, opposition, viewpoints, among, his, supporters, were, some, controversial, figures, namely, the, press, campaign, manager, francisco, rol, o, preto, a, former, nazi, sympathiser, and, former, leader, of, the, blue, shirts, arrested, and, exiled, by, the, regime, in, the, 1930s, official, figures, credited, delgado, with, one, fourth, of, the, votes, in, total, approximately, a, million, well, behind, tom, s, although, the, electoral, system, was, so, heavily, rigged, that, tom, s, could, not, possibly, have, been, defeated, salazar, was, alarmed, by, the, episode, leaving, nothing, to, chance, he, pushed, through, a, constitutional, amendment, transferring, election, of, the, president, to, the, two, parliamentary, bodies, which, were, both, firmly, under, his, control, delgado, was, expelled, from, the, portuguese, military, and, took, refuge, in, the, brazilian, embassy, before, going, into, exile, much, of, his, banishment, was, spent, in, brazil, and, later, in, algeria, as, a, guest, of, ahmed, ben, bella, later, in, 1965, he, was, lured, into, an, ambush, by, the, pide, the, regime, s, secret, police, near, the, border, town, of, olivenza, and, killed, alongside, his, brazilian, secretary, arajaryr, moreira, de, campos, an, official, statement, claimed, that, delgado, was, shot, and, killed, in, self, defence, despite, delgado, being, unarmed, de, campos, body, bore, marks, of, strangulation, during, the, last, years, of, the, monarchy, and, of, the, first, republic, in, portugal, an, attempt, was, made, to, obtain, firmer, control, over, the, claimed, african, possessions, one, reason, the, government, dragged, itself, into, world, war, i, was, the, defence, of, the, african, empire, considered, a, part, of, the, national, identity, salazar, briefly, served, as, minister, of, colonies, before, assuming, the, premiership, and, in, that, capacity, he, prepared, the, colonial, act, of, 1930, which, centralised, the, administration, of, the, colonies, in, his, own, system, and, proclaimed, the, need, to, bring, indigenous, peoples, into, western, civilisation, and, the, portuguese, nation, assimilation, was, the, main, objective, except, for, the, atlantic, colony, of, cape, verde, which, was, seen, as, an, extension, of, portugal, the, indian, colonies, and, macau, which, were, seen, as, having, their, own, forms, of, civilization, as, it, had, been, before, salazar, s, tenure, in, the, office, a, clear, legal, distinction, continued, to, be, made, between, indigenous, peoples, and, other, citizens, the, latter, mostly, europeans, some, creole, elites, and, a, few, black, africans, a, special, statute, was, given, to, native, communities, to, accommodate, their, tribal, traditions, in, theory, it, established, a, framework, that, would, allow, natives, to, be, gradually, assimilated, into, portuguese, culture, and, citizenship, while, in, reality, the, percentage, of, assimilated, african, population, never, reached, one, per, cent, in, 1945, portugal, still, had, an, extensive, colonial, empire, that, encompassed, portuguese, cape, verde, portuguese, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, portuguese, angola, including, cabinda, portuguese, guinea, and, portuguese, mozambique, in, africa, portuguese, india, in, south, asia, and, portuguese, macau, and, portuguese, timor, in, the, far, east, salazar, wanted, portugal, to, be, relevant, internationally, and, the, country, s, overseas, colonies, made, that, possible, in, 1947, captain, henrique, galv, o, a, portuguese, parliamentarian, submitted, a, report, disclosing, the, situation, of, forced, labor, and, precarious, health, services, in, the, portuguese, colonies, of, africa, the, natives, it, said, were, simply, regarded, as, beasts, of, burden, galv, o, s, courageous, report, eventually, led, to, his, downfall, and, in, 1952, he, was, arrested, for, subversive, activities, although, the, estatuto, do, indigenato, indigenous, statute, set, standards, for, indigenes, to, obtain, portuguese, citizenship, until, it, was, abolished, in, 1961, the, conditions, of, the, native, populations, of, the, colonies, were, still, harsh, and, they, suffered, inferior, legal, status, under, its, policies, under, the, colonial, act, african, natives, could, be, forced, to, work, by, requiring, all, african, men, to, pay, a, tax, in, portuguese, currency, the, government, created, a, situation, in, which, a, large, percentage, of, men, in, any, given, year, could, only, earn, the, specie, needed, to, pay, the, tax, by, going, to, work, for, a, colonial, employer, in, practice, this, enabled, settlers, to, use, forced, labor, on, a, massive, scale, frequently, leading, to, horrific, abuses, following, the, second, world, war, unlike, the, other, european, colonial, powers, salazar, attempted, to, resist, this, tide, of, decolonization, and, maintain, the, integrity, of, the, empire, in, order, to, justify, portugal, s, colonial, policies, and, portugal, s, alleged, civilising, mission, salazar, ended, up, adopting, gilberto, freyre, s, theories, of, lusotropicalism, which, maintained, that, the, portuguese, had, a, special, talent, for, adapting, to, environments, cultures, and, the, peoples, who, lived, in, the, tropics, in, order, to, build, harmonious, multiracial, societies, such, a, view, has, long, been, criticised, notably, by, charles, r, boxer, a, prominent, historian, of, colonial, empires, most, of, salazar, s, political, opponents, with, the, exception, of, the, portuguese, communist, party, also, strongly, favoured, colonialist, policies, this, was, the, case, with, jo, o, lopes, soares, father, of, m, rio, soares, who, had, been, minister, of, colonies, general, norton, de, matos, the, leader, of, the, opposition, supported, by, m, rio, soares, and, ant, nio, s, rgio, a, prominent, salazar, opponent, salazar, s, reluctance, to, travel, abroad, his, increasing, determination, not, to, grant, independence, to, the, colonies, and, his, refusal, to, grasp, the, impossibility, of, his, regime, outliving, him, marked, the, final, years, of, his, tenure, proudly, alone, was, the, motto, of, his, final, decade, for, the, portuguese, ruling, regime, the, overseas, empire, was, a, matter, of, national, identity, in, the, 1960s, armed, revolutionary, movements, and, scattered, guerrilla, activity, reached, mozambique, angola, and, portuguese, guinea, except, in, portuguese, guinea, the, portuguese, army, and, naval, forces, were, able, to, suppress, most, of, these, insurgencies, effectively, through, a, well, planned, counter, insurgency, campaign, using, light, infantry, militia, and, special, operations, forces, however, despite, the, early, military, successes, colonel, francisco, da, costa, gomes, quickly, pointed, out, that, there, could, be, no, permanent, military, solution, for, portugal, s, colonial, problem, in, 1961, general, j, lio, botelho, moniz, after, being, nominated, minister, of, defense, tried, to, convince, president, am, rico, tom, s, in, a, constitutional, coup, d, tat, to, remove, an, aged, salazar, from, the, premiership, botelho, moniz, ended, up, being, removed, from, his, government, position, his, political, ally, francisco, da, costa, gomes, was, nonetheless, allowed, to, publish, a, letter, in, the, newspaper, di, rio, popular, reiterating, his, view, that, a, military, solution, in, africa, was, unlikely, in, the, 1960s, most, of, the, world, ostracised, the, portuguese, government, because, of, its, colonial, policy, especially, the, newly, independent, african, nations, domestically, factions, within, portugal, s, elite, including, business, military, intellectuals, and, the, church, started, to, challenge, salazar, and, his, policies, later, despite, tentative, overtures, towards, an, opening, of, the, regime, marcelo, caetano, balked, at, ending, the, colonial, war, notwithstanding, the, condemnation, of, most, of, the, international, community, the, carnation, revolution, brought, retreat, from, the, colonies, and, acceptance, of, their, independence, the, subsequent, power, vacuum, leading, to, the, inception, of, newly, independent, communist, states, in, 1975, notably, the, people, s, republic, of, angola, and, the, people, s, republic, of, mozambique, which, promptly, began, to, expel, all, of, their, white, portuguese, citizens, as, a, result, over, a, million, portuguese, became, destitute, refugees, the, retornados, of, the, colonies, remaining, to, portugal, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, goa, was, the, first, to, be, lost, in, 1961, a, brief, conflict, drew, a, mixture, of, worldwide, praise, and, condemnation, for, portugal, in, india, the, action, was, seen, as, a, liberation, of, territory, historically, indian, by, reason, of, its, geographical, position, while, portugal, viewed, it, as, an, aggression, against, its, national, soil, and, its, own, citizens, after, india, gained, independence, on, 15, august, 1947, the, british, and, french, vacated, their, colonial, possessions, in, the, new, country, subsequently, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, initiated, proceedings, to, find, a, diplomatic, solution, to, the, goa, problem, the, portuguese, had, been, in, goa, since, 1510, while, an, independent, india, had, only, just, been, established, nehru, argued, that, the, goans, were, indians, by, every, standard, and, that, goa, was, a, colony, ruthlessly, administered, by, a, racist, and, fascist, colonial, regime, just, a, pimple, on, the, face, of, india, in, his, famous, phrase, salazar, maintained, that, in, spite, of, goa, s, location, and, the, nature, of, portugal, s, political, system, it, was, a, province, of, portugal, as, integral, to, his, nation, as, the, algarve, salazar, further, asserted, that, goans, nowhere, considered, or, called, themselves, indians, but, rather, deemed, themselves, to, be, portuguese, of, goa, and, that, goans, were, represented, in, the, portuguese, legislature, indeed, some, had, risen, to, the, highest, levels, of, government, and, the, administration, of, portuguese, universities, the, goans, had, portuguese, citizenship, with, full, rights, thus, access, to, all, governmental, posts, and, the, ability, to, earn, their, living, in, any, part, of, the, portuguese, territories, throughout, the, debate, between, salazar, and, nehru, many, goans, seem, to, have, been, apathetic, regarding, either, position, and, there, were, no, signs, in, goa, of, discontentment, with, the, portuguese, regime, reports, from, times, correspondents, suggested, that, not, only, were, the, residents, of, goa, unexcited, by, the, prospect, of, indian, sovereignty, but, that, even, the, diaspora, was, less, energised, than, the, indian, government, was, prone, to, suggest, contrary, to, what, these, politically, motivated, sources, suggest, goa, did, have, a, vigorous, and, well, established, anti, colonial, movement, led, by, prominent, figures, such, as, trist, o, de, bragan, a, cunha, with, ties, to, the, indian, national, congress, with, an, indian, military, operation, imminent, salazar, ordered, governor, general, manuel, vassalo, e, silva, to, fight, to, the, last, man, and, adopt, a, scorched, earth, policy, eventually, india, launched, operation, vijay, in, december, 1961, to, evict, portugal, from, goa, daman, and, diu, 31, portuguese, soldiers, were, killed, in, action, and, the, portuguese, navy, frigate, nrp, alfonso, de, albuquerque, was, destroyed, before, general, vassalo, e, silva, surrendered, salazar, forced, the, general, into, exile, for, disobeying, his, order, to, fight, to, the, last, man, and, surrendering, to, the, indian, army, support, and, opposition, to, india, s, action, was, on, expected, lines, statements, of, support, came, from, the, arab, states, newly, independent, ceylon, and, indonesia, yugoslavia, and, the, soviet, union, and, soviet, bloc, countries, statements, deploring, india, s, resort, to, force, in, goa, daman, and, diu, were, primarily, made, by, countries, with, overseas, colonies, including, the, united, kingdom, france, the, netherlands, spain, and, some, other, western, countries, notably, the, united, states, canada, and, australia, apart, from, regional, rivals, china, and, pakistan, salazar, was, a, close, friend, of, rhodesian, prime, minister, ian, smith, after, rhodesia, proclaimed, its, unilateral, declaration, of, independence, from, britain, in, 1965, portugal, supported, it, economically, and, militarily, through, neighbouring, portuguese, mozambique, until, 1975, even, though, it, never, officially, recognised, the, new, rhodesian, state, which, was, governed, by, a, white, minority, elite, in, 1975, the, mozambican, liberation, front, took, over, the, rule, of, mozambique, following, negotiations, with, the, new, portuguese, regime, installed, by, the, carnation, revolution, ian, smith, later, wrote, in, his, biography, the, great, betrayal, that, had, salazar, lasted, longer, than, he, did, the, rhodesian, government, would, have, survived, to, the, present, day, ruled, by, a, black, majority, government, under, the, name, of, zimbabwe, rhodesia, despite, the, authoritarian, character, of, the, regime, portugal, did, not, experience, the, same, levels, of, international, isolation, as, spain, did, following, world, war, ii, unlike, spain, portugal, under, salazar, was, accepted, into, the, marshall, plan, 1947, 1948, in, return, for, the, aid, it, gave, to, the, allies, during, the, final, stages, of, the, war, furthermore, also, unlike, spain, it, was, one, of, the, 12, founding, members, of, the, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, nato, in, 1949, a, reflection, of, portugal, s, role, as, an, ally, against, communism, during, the, cold, war, in, spite, of, its, status, as, the, only, non, democratic, founder, in, 1950, portugal, joined, the, european, payments, union, and, participated, in, the, founding, of, the, european, free, trade, association, efta, in, 1960, and, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, in, 1961, it, joined, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, in, 1962, and, finally, portugal, signed, a, free, trade, agreement, with, the, european, economic, community, in, 1972, still, under, the, auspices, of, the, estado, novo, although, the, militants, of, the, first, republic, had, chosen, education, as, one, of, their, banner, causes, the, evidence, shows, that, first, republic, was, less, successful, than, the, authoritarian, estado, novo, in, expanding, elementary, education, under, the, first, republic, literacy, levels, in, children, aged, 7, to, 14, registered, a, modest, increase, from, 26, in, 1911, to, 33, in, 1930, under, the, estado, novo, literacy, levels, in, children, of, the, same, age, group, increased, to, 56, in, 1940, 77, in, 1950, and, 97, in, 1960, under, salazar, the, number, of, elementary, schools, grew, from, 7, 000, in, 1927, to, 10, 000, in, 1940, while, the, illiteracy, rate, under, the, twenty, years, of, the, first, republic, had, only, dropped, a, modest, 9, under, salazar, in, twenty, years, the, illiteracy, rate, dropped, 21, from, 61, 8, in, 1930, to, 40, 4, in, 1950, in, 1940, the, regime, celebrated, the, fact, that, for, the, first, time, in, portuguese, history, the, majority, of, the, population, could, read, and, write, in, 1952, a, vast, multi, pronged, plan, for, popular, education, was, launched, with, the, intent, of, finally, extirpating, illiteracy, and, putting, into, school, every, child, of, school, age, this, plan, included, fines, for, parents, who, did, not, comply, and, these, were, strictly, enforced, by, the, late, 1950s, portugal, had, succeeded, in, pulling, itself, out, of, the, educational, abyss, in, which, it, had, long, found, itself, illiteracy, among, children, of, school, age, virtually, disappeared, in, the, 1960s, portugal, founded, universities, in, the, overseas, provinces, of, angola, and, mozambique, the, university, of, luanda, and, the, university, of, louren, o, marques, in, 1971, it, recognised, the, portuguese, catholic, university, and, by, 1973, founded, several, state, run, universities, across, mainland, portugal, the, minho, university, the, new, university, of, lisbon, the, university, of, vora, and, the, university, of, aveiro, in, addition, the, long, established, universities, of, lisbon, and, coimbra, were, greatly, expanded, and, modernised, new, buildings, and, campuses, were, constructed, such, as, the, cidade, universit, ria, lisbon, and, the, alta, universit, ria, coimbra, the, last, two, decades, of, the, estado, novo, from, the, 1960s, to, the, 1974, carnation, revolution, were, marked, by, strong, investment, in, secondary, and, university, education, which, experienced, one, of, the, fastest, growth, rates, of, portuguese, education, in, history, after, the, politically, unstable, and, financially, chaotic, years, of, the, portuguese, first, republic, financial, stability, was, salazar, s, highest, priority, his, first, incursions, into, portuguese, politics, as, a, member, of, the, cabinet, were, during, the, ditadura, nacional, when, portugal, s, public, finances, were, in, a, critical, state, with, an, imminent, threat, of, default, since, at, least, the, 1890s, after, salazar, became, prime, minister, he, levied, numerous, taxes, to, balance, the, portuguese, budget, and, pay, external, debts, salazar, s, first, years, were, marked, by, the, great, depression, and, the, second, world, war, the, first, era, of, his, rule, was, thus, an, economic, program, based, on, the, policies, of, autarky, and, interventionism, which, were, popular, in, the, 1930s, as, a, response, to, the, great, depression, under, salazar, the, portuguese, budget, went, from, insolvency, to, showing, a, substantial, surplus, every, year, from, 1928, portugal, s, credit, worthiness, rose, in, foreign, markets, and, the, external, floating, debt, was, completely, paid, however, portugal, remained, largely, underdeveloped, its, population, relatively, poor, and, with, low, education, attainment, when, compared, to, the, rest, of, europe, conservative, portuguese, scholars, such, as, jaime, nogueira, pinto, and, rui, ramos, claim, that, salazar, s, early, reforms, and, policies, allowed, political, and, financial, stability, therefore, social, order, and, economic, growth, on, the, other, hand, historians, such, as, the, leftist, politician, fernando, rosas, claim, that, salazar, s, policies, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1950s, led, to, economic, and, social, stagnation, and, rampant, emigration, that, turned, portugal, into, one, of, the, poorest, countries, in, europe, throughout, the, 1950s, salazar, maintained, the, same, import, substitution, approach, to, economic, policy, that, had, ensured, portugal, s, neutral, status, during, world, war, ii, from, 1950, until, salazar, s, death, portugal, saw, its, gdp, per, capita, increase, at, an, annual, average, rate, of, 3, 7, the, rise, of, new, technocrats, in, the, early, 1960s, with, a, background, in, economics, and, technical, industrial, expertise, led, to, a, new, period, of, economic, fostering, with, portugal, as, an, attractive, country, for, international, investment, industrial, development, and, economic, growth, would, continue, throughout, the, 1960s, during, salazar, s, tenure, portugal, participated, in, the, founding, of, the, european, free, trade, association, efta, in, 1960, and, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, in, 1961, in, the, early, 1960s, portugal, also, added, its, membership, in, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, gatt, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, and, the, world, bank, this, marked, the, initiation, of, salazar, s, more, outward, looking, economic, policy, portuguese, foreign, trade, increased, by, 52, in, exports, and, 40, in, imports, the, economic, growth, and, levels, of, capital, formation, from, 1960, to, 1973, were, characterised, by, an, unparalleled, robust, annual, growth, rates, of, gdp, 6, 9, industrial, production, 9, private, consumption, 6,

avoided, adding, more, problems, to, an, already, troubled, nation, but, he, could, not, accept, the, violation, of, rights, already, conceded, by, law, or, by, former, government, to, catholics, or, the, church, in, portugal, despite, his, identification, with, the, catholic, lobby, before, coming, to, power, and, the, fact, that, he, supposedly, based, his, political, philosophy, around, a, close, interpretation, of, the, catholic, social, doctrine, he, did, not, implement, any, direct, change, to, strengthen, the, presence, of, catholicism, in, portugal, in, the, initial, phase, of, his, rule, he, wanted, to, avoid, the, divisiveness, of, the, first, republic, and, he, knew, that, a, significant, part, of, the, political, elite, was, still, anti, clerical, church, and, state, remained, apart, no, attempt, was, made, to, establish, a, theocratic, policy, the, church, s, lost, property, was, never, restored, in, 1932, salazar, declared, the, portuguese, catholic, centre, to,

with, the, church, and, feels, sure, that, the, church, will, refrain, from, any, political, action, and, he, added, it, must, be, so, because, politicai, activity, corrupts, the, church, in, may,

visit, it, was, effectively, limited, to, a, single, day, in, f, tima, not, lisbon, and, the, pope, made, use, of, monte, real, air, base, instead, of, lisbon, airport, which, would, have, given, a,

hemorrhage, on, his, right, hemisphere, most, sources, maintain, that, it, was, caused, by, a, fall, from, a, chair, on, 3, august, in, his, summer, house, in, the, fort, of, saint, anthony, of, barra, in, february, 2009, there, were, anonymous, witnesses, who, admitted, after, some, investigation, into, salazar, s, best, kept, secrets, that, he, had, fallen, in, a, bath, instead, of, from,

at, his, funeral, salazar, never, married, he, has, no, known, descendants, salazar, s, image, in, public, opinion, was, of, a, man, entirely, dedicated, to, the, nation, almost, a, monk, far, removed, from, feminine, temptations, and, censorship, maintained, this, image, however, this, is, not, true, salazar, had, several, love, affairs, although, he, was, afraid, of, falling, in, love, one, of, his, seminary, colleagues, commented, he, never, says, the, words, that, people, expect, he, doesn, t, give, in, to, impulses, as, soon, as, he, has, given, something, from, his, heart, he, hastens, to, take, it, back, the, first, woman, in, his, life, was, felismina, de, oliveira, a, friend, of, his, sister, she, was, a, young, woman, from, a, modest, background, who, accompanied, her, on, saturday, visits, to, salazar, at, the, seminary, opposition, from, felismina, s, family, and, salazar, s, religious, career, put, an, end, to, the, relationship, however, in, 1910, salazar, left, the, seminary, and, entered, the, university, of, coimbra, he, never, intended, to, be, a, priest, in, coimbra, he, had, an, affair, with, the, pianist, gl, ria, castanheira, and, then, with, her, niece, maria, laura, campos, married, whom, he, met, several, times, in, the, hotel, borges, in, lisbon, between, 1931, and, 1932, even, after, she, had, married, for, the, second, time, the, affair, ended, when, laura, moved, to, seville, with, her, husband, also, at, the, hotel, borges, salazar, met, mercedes, de, castro, a, rich, daughter, of, a, diplomat, he, also, had, a, relationship, with, maria, emilia, vieira, a, young, woman, who, before, meeting, the, dictator, had, already, enjoyed, bohemian, adventures, in, paris, as, an, astrologer, and, a, dancer, his, last, affair, the, strongest, and, most, lasting, seems, to, have, been, the, one, he, had, with, christine, garnier, a, french, journalist, and, writer, whom, he, called, the, fragrant, disorder, the, latter, also, married, had, come, to, portugal, in, 1961, with, the, idea, of, writing, a, book, about, salazar, he, invited, her, to, come, to, portugal, on, vacation, to, santa, comba, d, o, she, was, amazed, by, the, modesty, of, his, house, christine, became, his, favorite, and, from, then, on, she, made, frequent, trips, between, portugal, and, france, salazar, abandoned, his, usual, avarice, for, a, while, and, bought, her, expensive, gifts, the, book, was, written, f, rias, com, salazar, a, bestseller, in, paris, christine, s, husband, later, found, salazar, s, letters, to, his, wife, and, eventually, asked, for, a, divorce, several, historians, and, observers, point, to, the, probable, platonic, love, of, his, virgin, governess, maria, de, jesus, caetano, freire, for, him, she, had, followed, him, from, coimbra, where, she, was, already, serving, him, to, lisbon, in, 1928, she, was, a, hard, and, strong, woman, rigid, vengeful, with, a, canine, dedication, to, the, dictator, an, important, character, he, said, the, governess, was, jealous, of, the, attention, he, gave, to, the, two, girls, whom, he, received, at, s, o, bento, and, who, belonged, to, her, family, maria, da, concei, o, rita, one, of, the, children, said, that, salazar, was, incapable, of, going, to, bed, without, stopping, by, her, room, he, was, also, the, one, who, played, with, them, and, told, them, stories, salazar, seen, by, the, world, as, a, cold, and, distant, man, who, rarely, smiled, was, nevertheless, affectionate, and, concerned, about, those, close, to, him, the, portuguese, literary, historian, ant, nio, jos, saraiva, a, communist, and, a, fierce, lifelong, political, opponent, of, salazar, claimed, that, one, who, reads, salazar, s, speeches, and, notes, is, overwhelmed, by, the, clarity, and, conciseness, of, style, the, most, perfect, and, captivating, doctrinal, prose, that, exists, in, portuguese, underscored, by, a, powerful, emotional, rhythm, according, to, saraiva, salazar, s, prose, deserves, a, prominent, place, in, the, history, of, portuguese, literature, and, only, political, barriers, have, deprived, it, of, its, place, saraiva, says, it, is, written, with, the, clarity, of, the, great, prose, of, the, 17th, century, cleansed, of, all, the, distractions, and, sloppiness, that, often, obscures, the, prose, of, the, portuguese, scholars, salazar, had, books, published, namely, como, se, levanta, um, estado, how, to, raise, a, state, in, which, he, criticised, the, philosophical, ideals, behind, the, nuremberg, laws, and, como, se, reergue, um, estado, how, to, re, erect, a, state, due, to, salazar, s, long, rule, a, detached, evaluation, of, him, is, difficult, while, his, rule, saw, more, stability, and, prosperity, than, most, living, portuguese, had, ever, known, it, came, at, the, expense, of, democracy, and, civil, liberties, in, 1983, historian, tom, gallagher, criticised, salazar, s, excessive, promises, writing, that, salazar, was, being, deceitful, when, he, told, ant, nio, ferro, in, 1938, i, estimate, that, within, five, years, every, child, in, this, country, will, have, the, opportunity, to, read, and, write, his, true, policy, had, been, revealed, six, years, earlier, when, he, stated, categorically, i, consider, more, urgent, the, creation, of, elites, than, the, necessity, to, teach, people, how, to, read, historian, neill, lochery, claims, salazar, was, one, of, the, most, gifted, men, of, his, generation, and, hugely, dedicated, to, his, job, and, country, according, to, american, scholar, j, wiarda, despite, certain, problems, and, continued, poverty, in, many, sectors, the, consensus, among, historians, and, economists, is, that, salazar, in, the, 1930s, brought, remarkable, improvements, in, the, economic, sphere, public, works, social, services, and, governmental, honesty, efficiency, and, stability, sir, samuel, hoare, the, british, ambassador, in, spain, recognised, salazar, s, crucial, role, in, keeping, the, iberian, peninsula, neutral, during, world, war, ii, and, lauded, him, hoare, asserted, that, in, his, 30, years, of, political, life, he, had, met, most, of, the, leading, statesmen, of, europe, and, regarded, salazar, highly, among, those, salazar, was, to, him, a, learned, and, impressive, thinker, part, professor, part, priest, part, recluse, of, unshakable, beliefs, he, regarded, him, as, ascetic, concentrated, on, serving, his, country, with, an, encyclopedic, knowledge, of, europe, and, indifferent, to, ostentation, luxury, or, personal, gains, hoare, strongly, believed, in, salazar, as, being, a, man, of, one, idea, the, good, of, his, country, not, wanting, to, endanger, the, work, of, national, regeneration, to, which, he, had, devoted, the, whole, of, his, public, life, historian, carlton, hayes, a, pioneering, specialist, on, the, study, of, nationalism, was, the, american, ambassador, in, spain, during, world, war, ii, he, met, salazar, in, person, and, agreed, with, ambassador, hoare, hayes, wrote, that, salazar, didn, t, look, like, a, regular, dictator, rather, he, appeared, a, modest, quiet, and, highly, intelligent, gentleman, and, scholar, literally, dragged, from, a, professorial, chair, of, political, economy, in, the, venerable, university, of, coimbra, a, dozen, years, previously, in, order, to, straighten, out, portugal, s, finances, and, that, his, almost, miraculous, success, in, this, respect, had, led, to, the, thrusting, upon, him, of, other, major, functions, including, those, of, foreign, minister, and, constitution, maker, hayes, appreciated, portugal, s, endeavours, to, form, a, truly, neutral, peninsular, bloc, with, spain, an, immeasurable, contribution, at, a, time, when, the, british, and, the, united, states, had, much, less, influence, towards, counteracting, the, propaganda, and, appeals, of, the, axis, morito, morishima, the, japanese, minister, in, portugal, during, world, war, ii, praised, salazar, in, his, post, war, memoirs, it, was, the, result, of, salazar, s, intelligence, and, political, ability, that, japan, portugal, diplomatic, relations, were, maintained, until, the, end, war, and, salazar, who, was, engaged, in, diplomacy, with, his, calm, attitude, firm, theory, and, judgment, sophisticated, expression, was, still, vivid, to, my, eyes, every, time, i, think, about, my, stay, in, portugal, i, can, t, stop, but, thinking, that, if, japan, had, had, one, politician, just, one, like, salazar, our, country, would, have, followed, a, different, path, and, we, would, not, be, going, through, our, current, misfortune, situation, belgian, diplomat, andr, de, staercke, dean, of, nato, s, ambassadors, who, served, for, almost, 24, years, on, the, alliance, council, developed, a, close, and, long, friendship, with, salazar, in, his, memoirs, staercke, dedicates, a, full, chapter, to, salazar, and, ranks, salazar, together, with, churchill, and, paul, henri, spaak, as, one, of, the, three, greatest, political, leaders, he, has, met, in, his, life, the, portuguese, literary, historian, ant, nio, jos, saraiva, a, communist, and, a, fierce, lifelong, political, opponent, of, salazar, claimed, that, salazar, was, undoubtedly, one, of, the, most, remarkable, men, in, the, history, of, portugal, and, possessed, a, quality, that, remarkable, men, do, not, always, have, the, right, intention, the, portuguese, historian, scholar, and, editor, a, h, de, oliveira, marques, wrote, of, salazar, he, considered, himself, the, guide, of, the, nation, believed, that, there, were, things, which, only, he, could, do, unfortunately, there, are, a, lot, of, things, that, seemingly, only, i, can, do, official, note, published, in, september, 1935, and, convinced, more, and, more, of, his, countrymen, of, that, too, he, became, more, and, more, of, a, dictator, more, and, more, inclined, to, deify, himself, and, to, trust, others, less, in, november, 1965, time, magazine, said, of, salazar, every, four, years, premier, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, preserves, portugal, s, image, as, a, democracy, by, blowing, the, dust, off, a, few, selected, opposition, leaders, and, relaxing, police, controls, just, enough, for, a, few, weeks, to, permit, them, to, run, for, portugal, s, 130, seat, national, assembly, there, are, a, few, cracks, in, the, facade, the, assembly, functions, only, as, a, rubber, stamp, the, opposition, candidates, are, usually, feeble, old, men, left, over, from, a, regime, that, was, discredited, and, overthrown, four, decades, ago, and, salazar, decides, what, they, can, and, cannot, talk, about, the, portuguese, poet, writer, and, literary, critic, fernando, pessoa, wrote, that, salazar, was, capable, of, governing, within, the, limits, of, his, area, of, expertise, which, is, financial, science, but, not, capable, of, governing, with, the, lack, of, limits, of, government, in, general, adding, that, what, is, wrong, here, is, not, that, sr, oliveira, salazar, is, minister, of, finance, which, i, accept, is, right, but, that, he, is, minister, of, everything, which, is, more, questionable, salazar, saw, no, prospects, for, his, regime, beyond, his, death, nonetheless, the, estado, novo, persisted, under, the, direction, of, marcelo, caetano, salazar, s, longtime, aide, as, well, as, a, well, reputed, scholar, of, the, university, of, lisbon, law, school, statesman, and, distinguished, member, of, the, regime, who, co, wrote, the, constitution, of, 1933, caetano, tried, to, blunt, the, harsher, edges, of, the, regime, he, helped, create, but, the, meager, reforms, he, was, able, to, wring, out, of, the, hardline, elements, of, the, government, did, not, go, nearly, far, enough, for, elements, of, the, population, who, wanted, more, freedom, the, estado, novo, eventually, fell, on, 25, april, 1974, with, the, carnation, revolution, salazar, was, made, member, of, the, following, portuguese, orders, he, also, received, several, other, similar, distinctions, from, countries, including, france, germany, belgium, poland, romania, and, spain,
