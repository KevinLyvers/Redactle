william, bradford, shockley, jr, february, 13, 1910, august, 12, 1989, was, an, american, inventor, physicist, and, eugenicist, he, was, the, manager, of, a, research, group, at, bell, labs, that, included, john, bardeen, and, walter, brattain, the, three, scientists, were, jointly, awarded, the, 1956, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, researches, on, semiconductors, and, their, discovery, of, the, transistor, effect, partly, as, a, result, of, shockley, s, attempts, to, commercialize, a, new, transistor, design, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, california, s, silicon, valley, became, a, hotbed, of, electronics, innovation, he, recruited, brilliant, employees, but, quickly, alienated, them, with, his, autocratic, and, erratic, management, they, left, and, founded, major, companies, in, the, industry, in, his, later, life, while, a, professor, of, electrical, engineering, at, stanford, university, and, afterward, shockley, became, known, as, a, racist, and, eugenicist, shockley, was, born, to, american, parents, in, london, on, february, 13, 1910, and, was, raised, in, his, family, s, hometown, of, palo, alto, california, from, the, age, of, three, his, father, william, hillman, shockley, was, a, mining, engineer, who, speculated, in, mines, for, a, living, and, spoke, eight, languages, his, mother, may, n, e, bradford, grew, up, in, the, american, west, graduated, from, stanford, university, and, became, the, first, female, u, s, deputy, mining, surveyor, shockley, was, homeschooled, up, to, the, age, of, eight, due, to, his, parents, dislike, of, public, schools, as, well, as, shockley, s, habit, of, violent, tantrums, shockley, learned, some, physics, at, a, young, age, from, a, neighbor, who, was, a, stanford, physics, professor, shockley, spent, two, years, at, palo, alto, military, academy, then, briefly, enrolled, in, the, los, angeles, coaching, school, to, study, physics, and, later, graduated, from, hollywood, high, school, in, 1927, shockley, earned, his, bachelor, of, science, degree, from, caltech, in, 1932, and, a, phd, from, mit, in, 1936, the, title, of, his, doctoral, thesis, was, electronic, bands, in, sodium, chloride, a, topic, suggested, by, his, thesis, advisor, john, c, slater, shockley, was, one, of, the, first, recruits, to, bell, labs, by, mervin, kelly, who, became, director, of, research, at, the, company, in, 1936, and, focused, on, hiring, solid, state, physicists, shockley, joined, a, group, headed, by, clinton, davisson, in, murray, hill, new, jersey, executives, at, bell, labs, had, theorized, that, semiconductors, may, offer, solid, state, alternatives, to, the, vacuum, tubes, used, throughout, bell, s, nationwide, telephone, system, shockley, conceived, a, number, of, designs, based, on, copper, oxide, semiconductor, materials, and, with, walter, brattain, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, create, a, prototype, in, 1939, shockley, published, a, number, of, fundamental, papers, on, solid, state, physics, in, physical, review, in, 1938, he, received, his, first, patent, electron, discharge, device, on, electron, multipliers, when, world, war, ii, broke, out, shockley, s, prior, research, was, interrupted, and, he, became, involved, in, radar, research, in, manhattan, new, york, city, in, may, 1942, he, took, leave, from, bell, labs, to, become, a, research, director, at, columbia, university, s, anti, submarine, warfare, operations, group, this, involved, devising, methods, for, countering, the, tactics, of, submarines, with, improved, convoying, techniques, optimizing, depth, charge, patterns, and, so, on, shockley, traveled, frequently, to, the, pentagon, and, washington, to, meet, high, ranking, officers, and, government, officials, in, 1944, he, organized, a, training, program, for, b, 29, bomber, pilots, to, use, new, radar, bomb, sights, in, late, 1944, he, took, a, three, month, tour, to, bases, around, the, world, to, assess, the, results, for, this, project, secretary, of, war, robert, patterson, awarded, shockley, the, medal, for, merit, on, october, 17, 1946, in, july, 1945, the, war, department, asked, shockley, to, prepare, a, report, on, the, question, of, probable, casualties, from, an, invasion, of, the, japanese, mainland, shockley, concluded, if, the, study, shows, that, the, behavior, of, nations, in, all, historical, cases, comparable, to, japan, s, has, in, fact, been, invariably, consistent, with, the, behavior, of, the, troops, in, battle, then, it, means, that, the, japanese, dead, and, ineffectives, at, the, time, of, the, defeat, will, exceed, the, corresponding, number, for, the, germans, in, other, words, we, shall, probably, have, to, kill, at, least, 5, to, 10, million, japanese, this, might, cost, us, between, 1, 7, and, 4, million, casualties, including, 400, 000, to, 800, 000, killed, this, report, influenced, the, decision, of, the, united, states, to, drop, atomic, bombs, on, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, which, preceded, the, surrender, of, japan, shockley, was, the, first, physicist, to, propose, a, log, normal, distribution, to, model, the, creation, process, for, scientific, research, papers, shortly, after, the, war, ended, in, 1945, bell, labs, formed, a, solid, state, physics, group, led, by, shockley, and, chemist, stanley, morgan, which, included, john, bardeen, walter, brattain, physicist, gerald, pearson, chemist, robert, gibney, electronics, expert, hilbert, moore, and, several, technicians, their, assignment, was, to, seek, a, solid, state, alternative, to, fragile, glass, vacuum, tube, amplifiers, first, attempts, were, based, on, shockley, s, ideas, about, using, an, external, electrical, field, on, a, semiconductor, to, affect, its, conductivity, these, experiments, failed, every, time, in, all, sorts, of, configurations, and, materials, the, group, was, at, a, standstill, until, bardeen, suggested, a, theory, that, invoked, surface, states, that, prevented, the, field, from, penetrating, the, semiconductor, the, group, changed, its, focus, to, study, these, surface, states, and, they, met, almost, daily, to, discuss, the, work, the, group, had, excellent, rapport, and, freely, exchanged, ideas, by, the, winter, of, 1946, they, had, enough, results, that, bardeen, submitted, a, paper, on, the, surface, states, to, physical, review, brattain, started, experiments, to, study, the, surface, states, through, observations, made, while, shining, a, bright, light, on, the, semiconductor, s, surface, this, led, to, several, more, papers, one, of, them, co, authored, with, shockley, which, estimated, the, density, of, the, surface, states, to, be, more, than, enough, to, account, for, their, failed, experiments, the, pace, of, the, work, picked, up, significantly, when, they, started, to, surround, point, contacts, between, the, semiconductor, and, the, conducting, wires, with, electrolytes, moore, built, a, circuit, that, allowed, them, to, vary, the, frequency, of, the, input, signal, easily, finally, they, began, to, get, some, evidence, of, power, amplification, when, pearson, acting, on, a, suggestion, by, shockley, put, a, voltage, on, a, droplet, of, glycol, borate, placed, across, a, p, n, junction, bell, labs, attorneys, soon, discovered, shockley, s, field, effect, principle, had, been, anticipated, and, devices, based, on, it, patented, in, 1930, by, julius, lilienfeld, who, filed, his, mesfet, like, patent, in, canada, on, october, 22, 1925, although, the, patent, appeared, breakable, it, could, not, work, the, patent, attorneys, based, one, of, its, four, patent, applications, only, on, the, bardeen, brattain, point, contact, design, three, others, submitted, first, covered, the, electrolyte, based, transistors, with, bardeen, gibney, and, brattain, as, the, inventors, shockley, s, name, was, not, on, any, of, these, patent, applications, this, angered, shockley, who, thought, his, name, should, also, be, on, the, patents, because, the, work, was, based, on, his, field, effect, idea, he, even, made, efforts, to, have, the, patent, written, only, in, his, name, and, told, bardeen, and, brattain, of, his, intentions, shockley, angered, by, not, being, included, on, the, patent, applications, secretly, continued, his, own, work, to, build, a, different, sort, of, transistor, based, on, junctions, instead, of, point, contacts, he, expected, this, kind, of, design, would, be, more, likely, to, be, commercially, viable, the, point, contact, transistor, he, believed, would, prove, to, be, fragile, and, difficult, to, manufacture, shockley, was, also, dissatisfied, with, certain, parts, of, the, explanation, for, how, the, point, contact, transistor, worked, and, conceived, of, the, possibility, of, minority, carrier, injection, on, february, 13, 1948, another, team, member, john, n, shive, built, a, point, contact, transistor, with, bronze, contacts, on, the, front, and, back, of, a, thin, wedge, of, germanium, proving, that, holes, could, diffuse, through, bulk, germanium, and, not, just, along, the, surface, as, previously, thought, 153, 145, shive, s, invention, sparked, shockley, s, invention, of, the, junction, transistor, 143, a, few, months, later, he, invented, an, entirely, new, considerably, more, robust, type, of, transistor, with, a, layer, or, sandwich, structure, this, structure, went, on, to, be, used, for, the, vast, majority, of, all, transistors, into, the, 1960s, and, evolved, into, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, shockley, later, described, the, workings, of, the, team, as, a, mixture, of, cooperation, and, competition, he, also, said, that, he, kept, some, of, his, own, work, secret, until, his, hand, was, forced, by, shive, s, 1948, advance, shockley, worked, out, a, rather, complete, description, of, what, he, called, the, sandwich, transistor, and, a, first, proof, of, principle, was, obtained, on, april, 7, 1949, meanwhile, shockley, worked, on, his, magnum, opus, electrons, and, holes, in, semiconductors, which, was, published, as, a, 558, page, treatise, in, 1950, the, tome, included, shockley, s, critical, ideas, of, drift, and, diffusion, and, the, differential, equations, that, govern, the, flow, of, electrons, in, solid, state, crystals, shockley, s, diode, equation, is, also, described, this, seminal, work, became, the, reference, text, for, other, scientists, working, to, develop, and, improve, new, variants, of, the, transistor, and, other, devices, based, on, semiconductors, this, resulted, in, his, invention, of, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, which, was, announced, at, a, press, conference, on, july, 4, 1951, in, 1951, he, was, elected, to, the, national, academy, of, sciences, nas, he, was, forty, one, years, old, this, was, rather, young, for, such, an, election, two, years, later, he, was, chosen, as, the, recipient, of, the, prestigious, comstock, prize, for, physics, by, the, nas, and, was, the, recipient, of, many, other, awards, and, honors, the, ensuing, publicity, generated, by, the, invention, of, the, transistor, often, thrust, shockley, to, the, fore, much, to, the, chagrin, of, bardeen, and, brattain, bell, labs, management, however, consistently, presented, all, three, inventors, as, a, team, though, shockley, would, correct, the, record, where, reporters, gave, him, sole, credit, for, the, invention, he, eventually, infuriated, and, alienated, bardeen, and, brattain, and, he, essentially, blocked, the, two, from, working, on, the, junction, transistor, bardeen, began, pursuing, a, theory, for, superconductivity, and, left, bell, labs, in, 1951, brattain, refused, to, work, with, shockley, further, and, was, assigned, to, another, group, neither, bardeen, nor, brattain, had, much, to, do, with, the, development, of, the, transistor, beyond, the, first, year, after, its, invention, shockley, left, bell, labs, around, 1953, and, took, a, job, at, caltech, shockley, bardeen, and, brattain, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1956, in, 1956, shockley, started, shockley, semiconductor, laboratory, in, mountain, view, california, which, was, close, to, his, elderly, mother, in, palo, alto, california, the, company, a, division, of, beckman, instruments, inc, was, the, first, establishment, working, on, silicon, semiconductor, devices, in, what, came, to, be, known, as, silicon, valley, shockley, recruited, brilliant, employees, to, his, company, but, alienated, them, by, undermining, them, relentlessly, he, may, have, been, the, worst, manager, in, the, history, of, electronics, according, to, his, biographer, joel, shurkin, shockley, was, autocratic, domineering, erratic, hard, to, please, and, increasingly, paranoid, in, one, well, known, incident, he, demanded, lie, detector, tests, to, find, the, culprit, after, a, company, secretary, suffered, a, minor, cut, in, late, 1957, eight, of, shockley, s, best, researchers, who, would, come, to, be, known, as, the, traitorous, eight, resigned, after, shockley, decided, not, to, continue, research, into, silicon, based, semiconductors, they, went, on, to, form, fairchild, semiconductor, a, loss, from, which, shockley, semiconductor, never, recovered, and, which, led, to, its, purchase, by, another, company, three, years, later, over, the, course, of, the, next, 20, years, more, than, 65, new, enterprises, would, end, up, having, employee, connections, back, to, fairchild, a, group, of, about, thirty, colleagues, have, met, on, and, off, since, 1956, to, reminisce, about, their, time, with, shockley, the, man, who, brought, silicon, to, silicon, valley, as, the, group, s, organizer, said, in, 2002, after, shockley, left, his, role, as, director, of, shockley, semiconductor, he, joined, stanford, university, where, he, was, appointed, the, alexander, m, poniatoff, professor, of, engineering, and, applied, science, in, 1963, a, position, which, he, held, until, he, retired, as, a, professor, emeritus, in, 1975, in, the, last, two, decades, of, his, life, shockley, who, had, no, degree, in, genetics, became, widely, known, for, his, extreme, views, on, race, and, human, intelligence, and, his, advocacy, of, eugenics, as, described, by, his, los, angeles, times, obituary, he, went, from, being, a, physicist, with, impeccable, academic, credentials, to, amateur, geneticist, becoming, a, lightning, rod, whose, views, sparked, campus, demonstrations, and, a, cascade, of, calumny, he, thought, his, work, was, important, to, the, future, of, humanity, and, he, also, described, it, as, the, most, important, aspect, of, his, career, he, argued, that, a, higher, rate, of, reproduction, among, purportedly, less, intelligent, people, was, having, a, dysgenic, effect, and, argued, that, a, drop, in, average, intelligence, would, lead, to, a, decline, in, civilization, he, also, claimed, that, black, people, were, genetically, and, intellectually, inferior, to, white, people, shockley, s, biographer, joel, shurkin, notes, that, for, much, of, shockley, s, life, in, the, racially, segregated, united, states, of, the, time, he, had, almost, no, contact, with, black, people, in, a, debate, with, psychiatrist, frances, cress, welsing, and, on, firing, line, with, william, f, buckley, jr, shockley, argued, my, research, leads, me, inescapably, to, the, opinion, that, the, major, cause, of, the, american, negro, s, intellectual, and, social, deficits, is, hereditary, and, racially, genetic, in, origin, and, thus, not, remediable, to, a, major, degree, by, practical, improvements, in, the, environment, shockley, was, one, of, the, race, theorists, who, received, money, from, the, pioneer, fund, and, at, least, one, donation, to, him, came, from, its, founder, the, eugenicist, wickliffe, draper, shockley, proposed, that, individuals, with, iqs, below, 100, should, be, paid, to, undergo, voluntary, sterilization, 1, 000, for, each, of, their, iq, points, under, 100, this, proposal, led, to, the, university, of, leeds, to, withdraw, its, offer, of, an, honorary, degree, to, him, anthropologist, and, far, right, activist, roger, pearson, defended, shockley, in, a, self, published, book, co, authored, with, shockley, in, 1973, university, of, wisconsin, milwaukee, professor, edgar, g, epps, argued, that, william, shockley, s, position, lends, itself, to, racist, interpretations, the, southern, poverty, law, center, describes, shockley, as, a, white, nationalist, who, failed, to, produce, evidence, for, his, eugenic, theories, amidst, near, universal, acknowledgement, that, his, work, was, that, of, a, racist, crank, the, science, writer, angela, saini, describes, shockley, as, having, been, a, notorious, racist, shockley, insisted, that, he, was, not, a, racist, he, wrote, that, his, findings, do, not, support, white, supremacy, instead, claiming, that, east, asians, and, jews, fare, better, than, whites, intellectually, in, 1973, edgar, epps, wrote, that, i, am, pleased, that, professor, shockley, is, not, an, aryan, supremacist, but, i, would, remind, him, that, a, theory, espousing, hereditary, superiority, of, orientals, or, jews, is, just, as, racist, in, nature, as, the, aryan, supremacy, doctrine, shockley, s, advocacy, of, eugenics, triggered, protests, in, one, incident, the, science, society, sigma, xi, fearing, violence, canceled, a, 1968, convocation, in, brooklyn, where, shockley, was, scheduled, to, speak, in, atlanta, in, 1981, shockley, filed, a, libel, suit, against, the, atlanta, constitution, after, a, science, writer, roger, witherspoon, compared, shockley, s, advocacy, of, a, voluntary, sterilization, program, to, nazi, human, experimentation, the, suit, took, three, years, to, go, to, trial, shockley, won, the, suit, but, he, only, received, one, dollar, in, damages, and, he, did, not, receive, any, punitive, damages, shockley, s, biographer, joel, shurkin, a, science, writer, on, the, staff, of, stanford, university, during, those, years, sums, this, statement, up, by, saying, that, it, was, defamatory, but, shockley, s, reputation, was, not, worth, much, by, the, time, the, trial, reached, a, verdict, shockley, taped, his, telephone, conversations, with, reporters, transcribed, them, and, sent, the, transcripts, to, the, reporters, by, registered, mail, at, one, point, he, toyed, with, the, idea, of, making, the, reporters, take, a, simple, quiz, on, his, work, before, he, would, discuss, the, subject, matter, of, it, with, them, his, habit, of, saving, all, of, his, papers, including, laundry, lists, provides, abundant, documentation, on, his, life, for, researchers, shockley, was, a, candidate, for, the, republican, nomination, in, the, 1982, united, states, senate, election, in, california, he, ran, on, a, single, issue, platform, of, opposing, the, dysgenic, threat, that, he, alleged, african, americans, and, other, groups, posed, he, came, in, eighth, place, in, the, primary, receiving, 8, 308, votes, and, 0, 37, of, the, vote, according, to, shurkin, by, this, time, his, racism, destroyed, his, credibility, almost, no, one, wanted, to, be, associated, with, him, and, many, of, those, who, were, willing, did, him, more, harm, than, good, foundation, for, research, and, education, on, eugenics, and, dysgenics, freed, was, a, non, profit, organization, founded, in, march, 1970, in, the, united, states, formed, to, support, the, research, of, shockley, who, was, the, president, of, the, foundation, and, r, travis, osborne, a, member, the, foundation, released, newsletter, freed, and, research, papers, at, stanford, university, the, organization, was, founded, according, to, its, mission, solely, for, scientific, and, educational, purposes, related, to, human, population, and, quality, problems, from, 1969, to, 1976, the, pioneer, fund, allocated, about, 2, 5, million, adjusted, for, inflation, in, 2023, to, support, shockley, s, endeavors, this, funding, was, distributed, through, grants, to, stanford, university, for, the, exploration, of, research, into, the, factors, which, affect, genetic, potential, and, also, directly, to, freed, via, freed, shockley, promoted, his, concept, of, a, voluntary, sterilization, bonus, plan, proposing, to, compensate, economically, disadvantaged, women, for, undergoing, sterilization, procedures, in, 1970, shockley, listed, former, senator, of, alaska, ernest, gruening, as, a, director, of, freed, at, age, 23, and, while, still, a, student, shockley, married, jean, bailey, in, august, 1933, the, couple, had, two, sons, and, a, daughter, shockley, separated, from, her, in, 1953, he, married, emily, lanning, a, psychiatric, nurse, in, 1955, she, helped, him, with, some, of, his, theories, although, one, of, his, sons, earned, a, phd, at, stanford, university, and, his, daughter, graduated, from, radcliffe, college, shockley, believed, his, children, represent, a, very, significant, regression, my, first, wife, their, mother, had, not, as, high, an, academic, achievement, standing, as, i, had, shockley, was, an, accomplished, rock, climber, going, often, to, the, shawangunks, in, the, hudson, river, valley, his, route, across, an, overhang, known, as, shockley, s, ceiling, is, one, of, the, classic, climbing, routes, in, the, area, several, climbing, guidebooks, changed, the, route, s, name, to, the, ceiling, in, 2020, due, to, shockley, s, eugenics, controversies, he, was, popular, as, a, speaker, lecturer, and, amateur, magician, he, once, magically, produced, a, bouquet, of, roses, at, the, end, of, his, address, before, the, american, physical, society, he, was, also, known, in, his, early, years, for, elaborate, practical, jokes, he, had, a, longtime, hobby, of, raising, ant, colonies, shockley, donated, sperm, to, the, repository, for, germinal, choice, a, sperm, bank, founded, by, robert, klark, graham, in, hopes, of, spreading, humanity, s, best, genes, the, bank, called, by, the, media, the, nobel, prize, sperm, bank, claimed, to, have, three, nobel, prize, winning, donors, though, shockley, was, the, only, one, to, publicly, acknowledge, his, involvement, however, shockley, s, controversial, views, brought, the, repository, for, germinal, choice, a, degree, of, notoriety, and, may, have, discouraged, other, nobel, prize, winners, from, donating, sperm, according, to, pbs, shockley, was, cruel, towards, his, children, and, unhappy, in, his, life, he, reportedly, tried, playing, russian, roulette, as, part, of, an, attempted, suicide, shockley, died, of, prostate, cancer, in, 1989, at, the, age, of, 79, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, estranged, from, most, of, his, friends, and, family, except, his, second, wife, the, former, emmy, lanning, 1913, 2007, his, children, reportedly, learned, of, his, death, by, reading, his, obituary, in, the, newspaper, shockley, is, interred, at, alta, mesa, memorial, park, in, palo, alto, california, shockley, was, granted, over, ninety, us, patents, some, notable, ones, are
