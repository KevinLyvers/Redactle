frederick, william, herschel, kh, frs, h, r, l, hur, sh, l, german, friedrich, wilhelm, herschel, 15, november, 1738, 25, august, 1822, was, a, german, british, astronomer, and, composer, he, frequently, collaborated, with, his, younger, sister, and, fellow, astronomer, caroline, herschel, born, in, the, electorate, of, hanover, william, herschel, followed, his, father, into, the, military, band, of, hanover, before, emigrating, to, great, britain, in, 1757, at, the, age, of, nineteen, herschel, constructed, his, first, large, telescope, in, 1774, after, which, he, spent, nine, years, carrying, out, sky, surveys, to, investigate, double, stars, herschel, published, catalogues, of, nebulae, in, 1802, 2, 500, objects, and, in, 1820, 5, 000, objects, the, resolving, power, of, the, herschel, telescopes, revealed, that, many, objects, called, nebulae, in, the, messier, catalogue, were, actually, clusters, of, stars, on, 13, march, 1781, while, making, observations, he, made, note, of, a, new, object, in, the, constellation, of, gemini, this, would, after, several, weeks, of, verification, and, consultation, with, other, astronomers, be, confirmed, to, be, a, new, planet, eventually, given, the, name, of, uranus, this, was, the, first, planet, to, be, discovered, since, antiquity, and, herschel, became, famous, overnight, as, a, result, of, this, discovery, george, iii, appointed, him, court, astronomer, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, and, grants, were, provided, for, the, construction, of, new, telescopes, herschel, pioneered, the, use, of, astronomical, spectrophotometry, using, prisms, and, temperature, measuring, equipment, to, measure, the, wavelength, distribution, of, stellar, spectra, in, the, course, of, these, investigations, herschel, discovered, infrared, radiation, other, work, included, an, improved, determination, of, the, rotation, period, of, mars, the, discovery, that, the, martian, polar, caps, vary, seasonally, the, discovery, of, titania, and, oberon, moons, of, uranus, and, enceladus, and, mimas, moons, of, saturn, herschel, was, made, a, knight, of, the, royal, guelphic, order, in, 1816, he, was, the, first, president, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, when, it, was, founded, in, 1820, he, died, in, august, 1822, and, his, work, was, continued, by, his, only, son, john, herschel, herschel, was, born, in, the, electorate, of, hanover, in, germany, then, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, one, of, ten, children, of, isaak, herschel, and, his, wife, anna, ilse, moritzen, of, german, lutheran, ancestry, his, ancestors, came, from, pirna, in, saxony, theories, that, they, were, protestants, from, bohemia, have, been, questioned, by, hamel, as, the, surname, herschel, already, occurred, a, century, earlier, in, the, very, same, area, that, the, family, lived, in, herschel, s, father, was, an, oboist, in, the, hanover, military, band, in, 1755, the, hanoverian, guards, regiment, in, whose, band, wilhelm, and, his, brother, jakob, were, engaged, as, oboists, was, ordered, to, england, at, the, time, the, crowns, of, great, britain, and, hanover, were, united, under, king, george, ii, as, the, threat, of, war, with, france, loomed, the, hanoverian, guards, were, recalled, from, england, to, defend, hanover, after, they, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, hastenbeck, herschel, s, father, isaak, sent, his, two, sons, to, seek, refuge, in, england, in, late, 1757, although, his, older, brother, jakob, had, received, his, dismissal, from, the, hanoverian, guards, wilhelm, was, accused, of, desertion, for, which, he, was, pardoned, by, george, iii, in, 1782, wilhelm, nineteen, years, old, at, this, time, was, a, quick, student, of, the, english, language, in, england, he, went, by, the, english, rendition, of, his, name, frederick, william, herschel, in, addition, to, the, oboe, he, played, the, violin, and, harpsichord, and, later, the, organ, he, composed, numerous, musical, works, including, 24, symphonies, and, many, concertos, as, well, as, some, church, music, six, of, his, symphonies, were, recorded, in, april, 2002, by, the, london, mozart, players, conducted, by, matthias, bamert, chandos, 10048, he, was, head, of, the, durham, militia, band, from, 1760, to, 1761, herschel, moved, to, sunderland, in, 1761, charles, avison, engaged, him, as, the, first, violin, and, soloist, for, his, newcastle, orchestra, where, he, played, for, one, season, in, sunderland, in, the, county, of, durh, apprill, 20th, 1761, he, wrote, his, symphony, no, 8, in, c, minor, he, visited, the, home, of, sir, ralph, milbanke, at, halnaby, hall, near, darlington, in, 1760, 14, where, he, wrote, two, symphonies, as, well, as, giving, performances, himself, after, newcastle, he, moved, to, leeds, and, halifax, where, he, was, the, first, organist, at, st, john, the, baptist, church, now, halifax, minster, 411, in, 1766, herschel, became, organist, of, the, octagon, chapel, bath, a, fashionable, chapel, in, a, well, known, spa, in, which, city, he, was, also, director, of, public, concerts, he, was, appointed, as, the, organist, in, 1766, and, gave, his, introductory, concert, on, 1, january, 1767, as, the, organ, was, still, incomplete, he, showed, off, his, versatility, by, performing, his, own, compositions, including, a, violin, concerto, an, oboe, concerto, and, a, harpsichord, sonata, on, 4, october, 1767, he, performed, on, the, organ, for, the, official, opening, of, the, octagon, chapel, his, sister, caroline, arrived, in, england, on, 24, august, 1772, to, live, with, william, in, new, king, street, bath, 1, 25, the, house, they, shared, is, now, the, location, of, the, herschel, museum, of, astronomy, herschel, s, brothers, dietrich, alexander, and, jakob, 1734, 1792, also, appeared, as, musicians, of, bath, in, 1780, herschel, was, appointed, director, of, the, bath, orchestra, with, his, sister, often, appearing, as, soprano, soloist, herschel, s, reading, in, natural, philosophy, during, the, 1770s, not, only, indicates, his, personal, interests, but, also, suggests, an, intention, to, be, upwardly, mobile, both, socially, and, professionally, he, was, well, positioned, to, engage, with, eighteenth, century, philosophical, gentleman, or, philomaths, of, wide, ranging, logical, and, practical, tastes, herschel, s, intellectual, curiosity, and, interest, in, music, eventually, led, him, to, astronomy, after, reading, robert, smith, s, harmonics, or, the, philosophy, of, musical, sounds, 1749, he, took, up, smith, s, a, compleat, system, of, opticks, 1738, which, described, techniques, of, telescope, construction, he, also, read, james, ferguson, s, astronomy, explained, upon, sir, isaac, newton, s, principles, and, made, easy, to, those, who, have, not, studied, mathematics, 1756, and, william, emerson, s, the, elements, of, trigonometry, 1749, the, elements, of, optics, 1768, and, the, principles, of, mechanics, 1754, herschel, took, lessons, from, a, local, mirror, builder, and, having, obtained, both, tools, and, a, level, of, expertise, started, building, his, own, reflecting, telescopes, he, would, spend, up, to, 16, hours, a, day, grinding, and, polishing, the, speculum, metal, primary, mirrors, he, relied, on, the, assistance, of, other, family, members, particularly, his, sister, caroline, and, his, brother, alexander, a, skilled, mechanical, craftsperson, he, began, to, look, at, the, planets, and, the, stars, in, may, 1773, and, on, 1, march, 1774, began, an, astronomical, journal, by, noting, his, observations, of, saturn, s, rings, and, the, great, orion, nebula, m42, the, english, astronomer, royal, nevil, maskelyne, visited, the, herschels, while, they, were, at, walcot, which, they, left, on, 29, september, 1777, by, 1779, herschel, had, also, made, the, acquaintance, of, sir, william, watson, who, invited, him, to, join, the, bath, philosophical, society, herschel, became, an, active, member, and, through, watson, would, greatly, enlarge, his, circle, of, contacts, a, few, years, later, in, 1785, herschel, was, elected, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, philadelphia, herschel, s, early, observational, work, soon, focused, on, the, search, for, pairs, of, stars, that, were, very, close, together, visually, astronomers, of, the, era, expected, that, changes, over, time, in, the, apparent, separation, and, relative, location, of, these, stars, would, provide, evidence, for, both, the, proper, motion, of, stars, and, by, means, of, parallax, shifts, in, their, separation, for, the, distance, of, stars, from, the, earth, the, latter, was, a, method, first, suggested, by, galileo, galilei, from, the, back, garden, of, his, house, in, new, king, street, bath, and, using, a, 6, 2, inch, aperture, 160, mm, 7, foot, focal, length, 2, 1, m, f, 13, newtonian, telescope, with, a, most, capital, speculum, of, his, own, manufacture, in, october, 1779, herschel, began, a, systematic, search, for, such, stars, among, every, star, in, the, heavens, 5, with, new, discoveries, listed, through, 1792, he, soon, discovered, many, more, binary, and, multiple, stars, than, expected, and, compiled, them, with, careful, measurements, of, their, relative, positions, in, two, catalogues, presented, to, the, royal, society, in, london, in, 1782, 269, double, or, multiple, systems, and, 1784, 434, systems, a, third, catalogue, of, discoveries, made, after, 1783, was, published, in, 1821, 145, systems, the, rev, john, michell, of, thornhill, published, work, in, 1767, on, the, distribution, of, double, stars, and, in, 1783, on, dark, stars, that, may, have, influenced, herschel, after, michell, s, death, in, 1793, herschel, bought, a, ten, foot, long, 30, inch, reflecting, telescope, from, michell, s, estate, in, 1797, herschel, measured, many, of, the, systems, again, and, discovered, changes, in, their, relative, positions, that, could, not, be, attributed, to, the, parallax, caused, by, the, earth, s, orbit, he, waited, until, 1802, in, catalogue, of, 500, new, nebulae, nebulous, stars, planetary, nebulae, and, clusters, of, stars, with, remarks, on, the, construction, of, the, heavens, to, announce, the, hypothesis, that, the, two, stars, were, binary, sidereal, systems, orbiting, under, mutual, gravitational, attraction, a, hypothesis, he, confirmed, in, 1803, in, his, account, of, the, changes, that, have, happened, during, the, last, twenty, five, years, in, the, relative, situation, of, double, stars, with, an, investigation, of, the, cause, to, which, they, are, owing, 8, 9, in, all, herschel, discovered, over, 800, confirmed, double, or, multiple, star, systems, almost, all, of, them, physical, rather, than, optical, pairs, his, theoretical, and, observational, work, provided, the, foundation, for, modern, binary, star, astronomy, 74, new, catalogues, adding, to, his, work, were, not, published, until, after, 1820, by, friedrich, wilhelm, struve, james, south, and, john, herschel, in, march, 1781, during, his, search, for, double, stars, herschel, noticed, an, object, appearing, as, a, disk, herschel, originally, thought, it, was, a, comet, or, a, stellar, disc, which, he, believed, he, might, actually, resolve, he, reported, the, sighting, to, nevil, maskelyne, the, astronomer, royal, he, made, many, more, observations, of, it, and, afterwards, russian, academician, anders, lexell, computed, the, orbit, and, found, it, to, be, probably, planetary, herschel, agreed, determining, that, it, must, be, a, planet, beyond, the, orbit, of, saturn, he, called, the, new, planet, the, georgian, star, georgium, sidus, after, king, george, iii, which, also, brought, him, favour, the, name, did, not, stick, in, france, where, reference, to, the, british, king, was, to, be, avoided, if, possible, the, planet, was, known, as, herschel, until, the, name, uranus, was, universally, adopted, the, same, year, herschel, was, awarded, the, copley, medal, and, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, 1782, he, was, appointed, the, king, s, astronomer, not, to, be, confused, with, the, astronomer, royal, on, 1, august, 1782, herschel, and, his, sister, caroline, moved, to, datchet, then, in, buckinghamshire, but, now, in, berkshire, there, he, continued, his, work, as, an, astronomer, and, telescope, maker, he, achieved, an, international, reputation, for, their, manufacture, profitably, selling, over, 60, completed, reflectors, to, british, and, continental, astronomers, from, 1782, to, 1802, and, most, intensively, from, 1783, to, 1790, herschel, conducted, systematic, surveys, in, search, of, deep, sky, or, non, stellar, objects, with, two, 20, foot, focal, length, 610, cm, 12, and, 18, 7, inch, aperture, 30, and, 47, cm, telescopes, in, combination, with, his, favoured, 6, inch, aperture, instrument, excluding, duplicated, and, lost, entries, herschel, ultimately, discovered, over, 2, 400, objects, defined, by, him, as, nebulae, at, that, time, nebula, was, the, generic, term, for, any, visually, diffuse, astronomical, object, including, galaxies, beyond, the, milky, way, until, galaxies, were, confirmed, as, extragalactic, systems, by, edwin, hubble, in, 1924, herschel, published, his, discoveries, as, three, catalogues, catalogue, of, one, thousand, new, nebulae, and, clusters, of, stars, 1786, catalogue, of, a, second, thousand, new, nebulae, and, clusters, of, stars, 1789, and, the, previously, cited, catalogue, of, 500, new, nebulae, 1802, he, arranged, his, discoveries, under, eight, classes, i, bright, nebulae, ii, faint, nebulae, iii, very, faint, nebulae, iv, planetary, nebulae, v, very, large, nebulae, vi, very, compressed, and, rich, clusters, of, stars, vii, compressed, clusters, of, small, and, large, stars, and, viii, coarsely, scattered, clusters, of, stars, herschel, s, discoveries, were, supplemented, by, those, of, caroline, herschel, 11, objects, and, his, son, john, herschel, 1754, objects, and, published, by, him, as, general, catalogue, of, nebulae, and, clusters, in, 1864, this, catalogue, was, later, edited, by, john, dreyer, supplemented, with, discoveries, by, many, other, 19th, century, astronomers, and, published, in, 1888, as, the, new, general, catalogue, abbreviated, ngc, of, 7, 840, deep, sky, objects, the, ngc, numbering, is, still, the, most, commonly, used, identifying, label, for, these, celestial, landmarks, 418, herschel, s, discoveries, later, compiled, in, the, new, general, catalogue, include, ngc, 12, ngc, 13, ngc, 14, ngc, 16, ngc, 23, ngc, 24, ngc, 1357, and, ngc, 7457, following, the, death, of, their, father, william, suggested, that, caroline, join, him, in, bath, england, in, 1772, caroline, was, first, introduced, to, astronomy, by, her, brother, caroline, spent, many, hours, polishing, the, mirrors, of, high, performance, telescopes, so, that, the, amount, of, light, captured, was, maximized, she, also, copied, astronomical, catalogues, and, other, publications, for, william, after, william, accepted, the, office, of, king, s, astronomer, to, george, iii, caroline, became, his, constant, assistant, in, october, 1783, a, new, 20, foot, telescope, came, into, service, for, william, during, this, time, william, was, attempting, to, observe, and, then, record, all, of, the, observations, he, had, to, run, inside, and, let, his, eyes, readjust, to, the, artificial, light, before, he, could, record, anything, and, then, he, would, have, to, wait, until, his, eyes, were, adjusted, to, the, dark, before, he, could, observe, again, caroline, became, his, recorder, by, sitting, at, a, desk, near, an, open, window, william, would, shout, out, his, observations, and, she, would, write, them, down, along, with, any, information, he, needed, from, a, reference, book, caroline, began, to, make, astronomical, discoveries, in, her, own, right, particularly, comets, in, 1783, william, built, her, a, small, newtonian, reflector, telescope, with, a, handle, to, make, a, vertical, sweep, of, the, sky, between, 1783, and, 1787, she, made, an, independent, discovery, of, m110, ngc, 205, which, is, the, second, companion, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, during, the, years, 1786, 1797, she, discovered, or, observed, eight, comets, she, found, fourteen, new, nebulae, and, at, her, brother, s, suggestion, updated, and, corrected, flamsteed, s, work, detailing, the, position, of, stars, she, also, rediscovered, comet, encke, in, 1795, caroline, herschel, s, eight, comets, were, published, between, 28, august, 1782, to, 5, february, 1787, five, of, her, comets, were, published, in, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, william, was, even, summoned, to, windsor, castle, to, demonstrate, caroline, s, comet, to, the, royal, family, william, recorded, this, phenomenon, himself, terming, it, my, sister, s, comet, she, wrote, letters, to, the, astronomer, royal, to, announce, the, discovery, of, her, second, comet, and, wrote, to, joseph, banks, upon, the, discovery, of, her, third, and, fourth, comets, the, catalogue, of, stars, taken, from, mr, flamsteed, s, observations, contained, an, index, of, more, than, 560, stars, that, had, not, been, previously, included, caroline, herschel, was, honoured, by, the, royal, astronomical, society, for, this, work, in, 1828, caroline, also, continued, to, serve, as, william, herschel, s, assistant, often, taking, notes, while, he, observed, at, the, telescope, for, her, work, as, william, s, assistant, she, was, granted, an, annual, salary, of, 50, by, george, iii, her, appointment, made, her, the, first, female, in, england, to, be, honoured, with, a, government, position, it, also, made, her, the, first, woman, to, be, given, a, salary, as, an, astronomer, in, june, 1785, owing, to, damp, conditions, william, and, caroline, moved, to, clay, hall, in, old, windsor, on, 3, april, 1786, the, herschels, moved, to, a, new, residence, on, windsor, road, in, slough, herschel, lived, the, rest, of, his, life, in, this, residence, which, came, to, be, known, as, observatory, house, it, was, demolished, in, 1963, william, herschel, s, marriage, in, 1788, caused, a, lot, of, tension, in, the, brother, sister, relationship, caroline, has, been, referred, to, as, a, bitter, jealous, woman, who, worshipped, her, brother, and, resented, her, sister, in, law, for, invading, her, domestic, life, with, the, arrival, of, mary, caroline, lost, her, managerial, and, social, responsibilities, in, the, household, and, with, them, much, of, her, status, caroline, destroyed, her, journals, between, the, years, 1788, to, 1798, so, her, feelings, during, this, period, are, not, entirely, known, according, to, her, memoir, caroline, then, moved, to, separate, lodgings, but, continued, to, work, as, her, brother, s, assistant, when, her, brother, and, his, family, were, away, from, their, home, she, would, often, return, to, take, care, of, it, for, them, in, later, life, caroline, and, lady, herschel, exchanged, affectionate, letters, caroline, continued, her, astronomical, work, after, william, s, death, in, 1822, she, worked, to, verify, and, confirm, his, findings, as, well, as, putting, together, catalogues, of, nebulae, towards, the, end, of, her, life, she, arranged, two, and, a, half, thousand, nebulae, and, star, clusters, into, zones, of, similar, polar, distances, she, did, this, so, that, her, nephew, john, could, re, examine, them, systematically, eventually, this, list, was, enlarged, and, renamed, the, new, general, catalogue, in, 1828, she, was, awarded, the, gold, medal, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, for, her, work, the, most, common, type, of, telescope, at, that, time, was, the, refracting, telescope, which, involved, the, refraction, of, light, through, a, tube, using, a, convex, glass, lens, this, design, was, subject, to, chromatic, aberration, a, distortion, of, an, image, due, to, the, failure, of, light, of, different, component, wavelengths, to, converge, optician, john, dollond, 1706, 1761, tried, to, correct, for, this, distortion, by, combining, two, separate, lenses, but, it, was, still, difficult, to, achieve, good, resolution, for, far, distant, light, sources, reflector, telescopes, invented, by, isaac, newton, in, 1668, used, a, single, concave, mirror, rather, than, a, convex, lens, this, avoids, chromatic, aberration, the, concave, mirror, gathered, more, light, than, a, lens, reflecting, it, onto, a, flat, mirror, at, the, end, of, the, telescope, for, viewing, a, smaller, mirror, could, provide, greater, magnification, and, a, larger, field, of, view, than, a, convex, lens, newton, s, first, mirror, was, 1, 3, inches, in, diameter, such, mirrors, were, rarely, more, than, 3, inches, in, diameter, because, of, the, poor, reflectivity, of, mirrors, made, of, speculum, metal, herschel, eliminated, the, small, diagonal, mirror, of, a, standard, newtonian, reflector, from, his, design, and, tilted, his, primary, mirror, so, he, could, view, the, formed, image, directly, this, front, view, design, has, come, to, be, called, the, herschelian, telescope, 7, the, creation, of, larger, symmetrical, mirrors, was, extremely, difficult, any, flaw, would, result, in, a, blurred, image, because, no, one, else, was, making, mirrors, of, the, size, and, magnification, desired, by, herschel, he, determined, to, make, his, own, this, was, no, small, undertaking, he, was, assisted, by, his, sister, caroline, and, other, family, members, caroline, herschel, described, the, pouring, of, a, 30, foot, focal, length, mirror, a, day, was, set, apart, for, casting, and, the, metal, was, in, the, furnace, but, unfortunately, it, began, to, leak, at, the, moment, when, ready, for, pouring, and, both, my, brothers, and, the, caster, with, his, men, were, obliged, to, run, out, at, opposite, doors, for, the, stone, flooring, which, ought, to, have, been, taken, up, flew, about, in, all, directions, as, high, as, the, ceiling, my, poor, brother, fell, exhausted, with, heat, and, exertion, on, a, heap, of, brickbats, before, the, second, casting, was, attempted, everything, which, could, ensure, success, had, been, attended, to, and, a, very, perfect, metal, was, found, in, the, mould, which, had, cracked, in, the, cooling, herschel, is, reported, to, have, cast, ground, and, polished, more, than, four, hundred, mirrors, for, telescopes, varying, in, size, from, 6, to, 48, inches, in, diameter, herschel, and, his, assistants, built, and, sold, at, least, sixty, complete, telescopes, of, various, sizes, commissions, for, the, making, and, selling, of, mirrors, and, telescopes, provided, herschel, with, an, additional, source, of, income, the, king, of, spain, reportedly, paid, 3, 150, for, a, telescope, an, essential, part, of, constructing, and, maintaining, telescopes, was, the, grinding, and, polishing, of, their, mirrors, this, had, to, be, done, repeatedly, whenever, the, mirrors, deformed, or, tarnished, during, use, the, only, way, to, test, the, accuracy, of, a, mirror, was, to, use, it, the, largest, and, most, famous, of, herschel, s, telescopes, was, a, reflecting, telescope, with, a, 49, 1, 2, inch, diameter, 1, 26, m, primary, mirror, and, a, 40, foot, 12, m, focal, length, the, 40, foot, telescope, was, at, that, time, the, largest, scientific, instrument, that, had, been, built, it, was, hailed, as, a, triumph, of, human, perseverance, and, zeal, for, the, sublimest, science, 215, in, 1785, herschel, approached, king, george, for, money, to, cover, the, cost, of, building, the, 40, foot, telescope, he, received, 4, 000, without, royal, patronage, the, telescope, could, not, have, been, created, as, it, was, it, took, five, years, and, went, over, budget, the, herschel, home, in, slough, became, a, scramble, of, labourers, and, workmen, smiths, and, carpenters, a, 40, foot, telescope, tube, had, to, be, cast, of, iron, the, tube, was, large, enough, to, walk, through, mirror, blanks, were, poured, from, speculum, metal, a, mix, of, copper, and, tin, they, were, almost, four, feet, 1, 2, m, in, diameter, and, weighed, 1, 000, pounds, 450, kg, when, the, first, disk, deformed, due, to, its, weight, a, second, thicker, one, was, made, with, a, higher, content, of, copper, the, mirrors, had, to, be, hand, polished, a, painstaking, process, a, mirror, was, repeatedly, put, into, the, telescope, and, removed, again, to, ensure, that, it, was, properly, formed, when, a, mirror, deformed, or, tarnished, it, had, to, be, removed, repolished, and, replaced, in, the, apparatus, a, huge, rotating, platform, was, built, to, support, the, telescope, enabling, it, to, be, repositioned, by, assistants, as, a, sweep, progressed, a, platform, near, the, top, of, the, tube, enabled, the, viewer, to, look, down, into, the, tube, and, view, the, resulting, image, in, 1789, shortly, after, this, instrument, was, operational, herschel, discovered, a, new, moon, of, saturn, mimas, only, 250, miles, 400, km, in, diameter, discovery, of, a, second, moon, enceladus, followed, within, the, first, month, of, observation, the, 40, foot, 12, metre, telescope, proved, very, cumbersome, and, in, spite, of, its, size, not, very, effective, at, showing, clearer, images, herschel, s, technological, innovations, had, taken, him, to, the, limits, of, what, was, possible, with, the, technology, of, his, day, the, 40, foot, would, not, be, improved, upon, until, the, victorians, developed, techniques, for, the, precision, engineering, of, large, high, quality, mirrors, william, herschel, was, disappointed, with, it, most, of, herschel, s, observations, were, done, with, a, smaller, 18, 5, inch, 47, cm, 20, foot, focal, length, 6, 1, m, reflector, nonetheless, the, 40, foot, caught, the, public, imagination, it, inspired, scientists, and, writers, including, erasmus, darwin, and, william, blake, and, impressed, foreign, tourists, and, french, dignitaries, king, george, was, pleased, herschel, discovered, that, unfilled, telescope, apertures, can, be, used, to, obtain, high, angular, resolution, something, which, became, the, essential, basis, for, interferometric, imaging, in, astronomy, in, particular, aperture, masking, interferometry, and, hypertelescopes, in, 2012, the, bbc, television, programme, stargazing, live, built, a, replica, of, the, 20, foot, telescope, using, herschel, s, original, plans, but, modern, materials, it, is, to, be, considered, a, close, modern, approximation, rather, than, an, exact, replica, a, modern, glass, mirror, was, used, the, frame, uses, metal, scaffolding, and, the, tube, is, a, sewer, pipe, the, telescope, was, shown, on, the, programme, in, january, 2013, and, stands, on, the, art, design, and, technology, campus, of, the, university, of, derby, where, it, will, be, used, for, educational, purposes, herschel, was, sure, that, he, had, found, ample, evidence, of, life, on, the, moon, and, compared, it, to, the, english, countryside, he, did, not, refrain, himself, from, theorising, that, the, other, planets, were, populated, with, a, special, interest, in, mars, which, was, in, line, with, most, of, his, contemporary, scientists, during, herschel, s, time, scientists, tended, to, believe, in, a, plurality, of, civilised, worlds, in, contrast, most, religious, thinkers, referred, to, unique, properties, of, the, earth, herschel, went, so, far, as, to, speculate, that, the, interior, of, the, sun, was, populated, herschel, examined, the, correlation, of, solar, variation, and, solar, cycle, and, climate, over, a, period, of, 40, years, 1779, 1818, herschel, regularly, observed, sunspots, and, their, variations, in, number, form, and, size, most, of, his, observations, took, place, in, a, period, of, low, solar, activity, the, dalton, minimum, when, sunspots, were, relatively, few, in, number, this, was, one, of, the, reasons, why, herschel, was, not, able, to, identify, the, standard, 11, year, period, in, solar, activity, herschel, compared, his, observations, with, the, series, of, wheat, prices, published, by, adam, smith, in, the, wealth, of, nations, in, 1801, herschel, reported, his, findings, to, the, royal, society, and, indicated, five, prolonged, periods, of, few, sunspots, correlated, with, the, price, of, wheat, herschel, s, study, was, ridiculed, by, some, of, his, contemporaries, but, did, initiate, further, attempts, to, find, a, correlation, later, in, the, 19th, century, william, stanley, jevons, proposed, the, 11, year, cycle, with, herschel, s, basic, idea, of, a, correlation, between, the, low, number, of, sunspots, and, lower, yields, explaining, recurring, booms, and, slumps, in, the, economy, herschel, s, speculation, on, a, connection, between, sunspots, and, regional, climate, using, the, market, price, of, wheat, as, a, proxy, continues, to, be, cited, according, to, one, study, the, influence, of, solar, activity, can, actually, be, seen, on, the, historical, wheat, market, in, england, over, ten, solar, cycles, between, 1600, and, 1700, the, evaluation, is, controversial, and, the, significance, of, the, correlation, is, doubted, by, some, scientists, in, his, later, career, herschel, discovered, two, moons, of, saturn, mimas, and, enceladus, as, well, as, two, moons, of, uranus, titania, and, oberon, he, did, not, give, these, moons, their, names, they, were, named, by, his, son, john, in, 1847, and, 1852, respectively, after, his, death, herschel, measured, the, axial, tilt, of, mars, and, discovered, that, the, martian, ice, caps, first, observed, by, giovanni, domenico, cassini, 1666, and, christiaan, huygens, 1672, changed, size, with, that, planet, s, seasons, it, has, been, suggested, that, herschel, discovered, rings, around, uranus, herschel, introduced, but, did, not, create, the, word, asteroid, meaning, star, like, from, the, greek, asteroeides, aster, star, eidos, form, shape, in, 1802, shortly, after, olbers, discovered, the, second, minor, planet, 2, pallas, in, late, march, to, describe, the, star, like, appearance, of, the, small, moons, of, the, giant, planets, and, of, the, minor, planets, the, planets, all, show, discs, by, comparison, by, the, 1850s, asteroid, became, a, standard, term, for, describing, certain, minor, planets, from, studying, the, proper, motion, of, stars, the, nature, and, extent, of, the, solar, motion, was, first, demonstrated, by, herschel, in, 1783, along, with, first, determining, the, direction, for, the, solar, apex, to, lambda, herculis, only, 10, away, from, today, s, accepted, position, herschel, also, studied, the, structure, of, the, milky, way, and, was, the, first, to, propose, a, model, of, the, galaxy, based, on, observation, and, measurement, he, concluded, that, it, was, in, the, shape, of, a, disk, but, incorrectly, assumed, that, the, sun, was, in, the, centre, of, the, disk, this, heliocentric, view, was, eventually, replaced, by, galactocentrism, due, to, the, work, of, harlow, shapley, heber, doust, curtis, and, edwin, hubble, in, the, 20th, century, all, three, men, used, significantly, more, far, reaching, and, accurate, telescopes, than, herschel, s, in, early, 1800, herschel, was, testing, different, filters, to, pass, sunlight, through, and, noticed, that, filters, of, different, colors, seemed, to, generate, varying, amounts, of, heat, he, decided, to, pass, the, light, through, a, prism, to, measure, the, different, colors, of, light, using, a, thermometer, and, in, the, process, took, a, measurement, just, beyond, the, red, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, he, detected, a, temperature, one, degree, higher, than, that, of, red, light, further, experimentation, led, to, herschel, s, conclusion, that, there, must, be, an, invisible, form, of, light, beyond, the, visible, spectrum, he, published, these, results, in, april, 1800, herschel, used, a, microscope, to, establish, that, coral, was, not, a, plant, as, many, at, the, time, believed, because, it, lacked, the, cell, walls, characteristic, of, plants, it, is, in, fact, an, animal, a, marine, invertebrate, on, 8, may, 1788, william, herschel, married, the, widow, mary, pitt, n, e, baldwin, at, st, laurence, s, church, upton, in, slough, they, had, one, child, john, born, at, observatory, house, on, 7, march, 1792, william, s, personal, background, and, rise, as, man, of, science, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, upbringing, of, his, son, and, grandchildren, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1788, in, 1816, william, was, made, a, knight, of, the, royal, guelphic, order, by, the, prince, regent, and, was, accorded, the, honorary, title, sir, although, this, was, not, the, equivalent, of, an, official, british, knighthood, he, helped, to, found, the, astronomical, society, of, london, in, 1820, which, in, 1831, received, a, royal, charter, and, became, the, royal, astronomical, society, in, 1813, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, on, 25, august, 1822, herschel, died, at, observatory, house, windsor, road, slough, after, a, long, illness, he, was, buried, at, nearby, st, laurence, s, church, upton, slough, herschel, s, epitaph, is, coelorum, perrupit, claustra, he, broke, through, the, barriers, of, the, heavens, caroline, was, deeply, distressed, by, his, death, and, soon, after, his, burial, she, returned, to, hanover, a, decision, she, later, regretted, she, had, lived, in, england, for, fifty, years, her, interests, were, much, more, in, line, with, her, nephew, john, herschel, also, an, astronomer, than, with, her, surviving, family, in, hanover, she, continued, to, work, on, the, organization, and, cataloguing, of, nebulae, creating, what, would, later, become, the, basis, of, the, new, general, catalogue, she, died, on, 9, january, 1848, william, herschel, lived, most, of, his, life, in, the, town, of, slough, then, in, buckinghamshire, now, in, berkshire, he, died, in, the, town, and, was, buried, under, the, tower, of, the, church, of, st, laurence, upton, cum, chalvey, near, slough, herschel, is, especially, honoured, in, slough, and, there, are, several, memorials, to, him, and, his, discoveries, in, 2011, a, new, bus, station, the, design, of, which, was, inspired, by, the, infrared, experiment, of, william, herschel, was, built, in, the, centre, of, slough, john, keats, alludes, to, herschel, s, discovery, of, uranus, in, his, sonnet, on, first, looking, into, chapman, s, homer, then, felt, i, like, some, watcher, of, the, skies, when, a, new, planet, swims, into, his, ken, per, richard, holmes, keats, picks, out, the, finding, of, uranus, thirty, five, years, before, as, one, of, the, defining, moments, of, the, age, his, house, at, 19, new, king, street, in, bath, somerset, where, he, made, many, telescopes, and, first, observed, uranus, is, now, home, to, the, herschel, museum, of, astronomy, there, is, a, memorial, near, the, choir, screen, in, westminster, abbey, herschel, s, complete, musical, works, are, as, follows, various, vocal, works, including, a, te, deum, psalms, motets, and, sacred, chants, along, with, some, catches, keyboard, works, for, organ, and, harpsichord
