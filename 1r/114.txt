century, french, painting, committed, to, painting, only, what, he, could, see, he, rejected, academic, convention, and, the, romanticism, of, the, previous, generation, of, visual, artists, his, independence, set, an, example, that, was, important, to, later, artists, such, as, the, impressionists, and, the, cubists, courbet, occupies, an, important, place, in, 19th, century, french, painting, as, an, innovator, and, as, an, artist, willing, to, make, bold, social, statements, through, his, work, courbet, s, paintings, of, the, late, 1840s, and, early, 1850s, brought, him, his, first, recognition, they, challenged, convention, by, depicting, unidealized, peasants, and, workers, often, on, a, grand, scale, traditionally, reserved, for, paintings, of, religious, or, historical, subjects, courbet, s, subsequent, paintings, were, mostly, of, a, less, overtly, political, character, landscapes, seascapes, hunting, scenes, nudes, and, still, lifes, courbet, was, imprisoned, for, six, months, in, 1871, for, his, involvement, with, the, paris, commune, and, lived, in, exile, in, switzerland, from, 1873, until, his, death, four, years, later, gustave, courbet,

the, french, revolution, courbet, s, sisters, zo, z, lie, and, juliette, were, his, first, models, for, drawing, and, painting, after, moving, to, paris, he, often, returned, home, to, ornans, to, hunt, fish, and, find, inspiration, courbet, went, to, paris, in, 1839, and, worked, at, the, studio, of, steuben, and, hesse, an, independent, spirit, he, soon, left, preferring, to, develop, his, own, style, by, studying, the, paintings, of, spanish, flemish, and, french, masters, in, the, louvre, and, painting, copies, of, their, work, courbet, s, first, works, were, an, odalisque, inspired, by, the, writing, of, victor, hugo, and, a, l, lia, illustrating, george, sand, but, he, soon, abandoned, literary, influences, choosing, instead, to, base, his, paintings, on, observed, reality, among, his, paintings, of, the, early, 1840s, are, several, self, portraits, romantic, in, conception, in, which, the, artist, portrayed, himself, in, various, roles, these, include, self, portrait, with, black, dog, c, 1842, 44, accepted, for, exhibition, at, the, 1844, paris, salon, the, theatrical, self, portrait, which, is, also, known, as, desperate, man, c, 1843, 45, lovers, in, the, countryside, 1844, mus, e, des, beaux, arts, lyon, the, sculptor, 1845, the, wounded, man, 1844, 54, mus, e, d, orsay, paris, the, cellist, self, portrait, 1847, nationalmuseum, stockholm, shown, at, the, 1848, salon, and, man, with, a, pipe, 1848, 49, mus, e, fabre, montpellier, trips, to, the, netherlands, and, belgium, in, 1846, 47, strengthened, courbet, s, belief, that, painters, should, portray, the, life, around, them, as, rembrandt, hals, and, other, dutch, masters, had, by, 1848, he, had, gained, supporters, among, the, younger, critics, the, neo, romantics, and, realists, notably, champfleury, courbet, achieved, his, first, salon, success, in, 1849, with, his, painting, after, dinner, at, ornans, the, work, reminiscent, of, chardin, and, le, nain, earned, courbet, a, gold, medal, and, was, purchased, by, the, state, the, gold, medal, meant, that, his, works, would, no, longer, require, jury, approval, for, exhibition, at, the, salon, an, exemption, courbet, enjoyed, until, 1857, when, the, rule, changed, in, 1849, 50, courbet, painted, the, stone, breakers, destroyed, in, the, allied, bombing, of, dresden, in, 1945, which, proudhon, admired, as, an, icon, of, peasant, life, it, has, been, called, the, first, of, his, great, works, the, painting, was, inspired, by, a, scene, courbet, witnessed, on, the, roadside, he, later, explained, to, champfleury, and, the, writer, francis, wey, it, is, not, often, that, one, encounters, so, complete, an, expression, of, poverty, and, so, right, then, and, there, i, got, the, idea, for, a, painting, i, told, them, to, come, to, my, studio, the, next, morning, courbet, s, work, belonged, neither, to, the, predominant, romantic, nor, neoclassical, schools, history, painting, which, the, paris, salon, esteemed, as, a, painter, s, highest, calling, did, not, interest, him, for, he, believed, that, the, artists, of, one, century, basically, incapable, of, reproducing, the, aspect, of, a, past, or, future, century, instead, he, maintained, that, the, only, possible, source, for, living, art, is, the, artist, s, own, experience, he, and, jean, fran, ois, millet, would, find, inspiration, painting, the, life, of, peasants, and, workers, courbet, painted, figurative, compositions, landscapes, seascapes, and, still, lifes, he, courted, controversy, by, addressing, social, issues, in, his, work, and, by, painting, subjects, that, were, considered, vulgar, such, as, the, rural, bourgeoisie, peasants, and, working, conditions, of, the, poor, his, work, along, with, that, of, honor, daumier, and, jean, fran, ois, millet, became, known, as, realism, for, courbet, realism, dealt, not, with, the, perfection, of, line, and, form, but, entailed, spontaneous, and, rough, handling, of, paint, suggesting, direct, observation, by, the, artist, while, portraying, the, irregularities, in, nature, he, depicted, the, harshness, of, life, and, in, doing, so, challenged, contemporary, academic, ideas, of, art, one, of, the, distinctive, features, of, courbet, s, realism, was, his, lifelong, attachment, to, his, native, province, the, franche, comt, and, of, his, birthplace, ornans, considered, to, be, the, first, of, courbet, s, great, works, the, stone, breakers, of, 1849, is, an, example, of, social, realism, that, caused, a, sensation, when, it, was, first, exhibited, at, the, paris, salon, in, 1850, the, work, was, based, on, two, men, one, young, and, one, old, whom, courbet, discovered, engaged, in, backbreaking, labor, on, the, side, of, the, road, when, he, returned, to, ornans, for, an, eight, month, visit, in, october, 1848, on, his, inspiration, courbet, told, his, friends, and, art, critics, francis, wey, and, jules, champfleury, it, is, not, often, that, one, encounters, so, complete, an, expression, of, poverty, and, so, right, then, and, there, i, got, the, idea, for, a, painting, while, other, artists, had, depicted, the, plight, of, the, rural, poor, courbet, s, peasants, are, not, idealized, like, those, in, works, such, as, breton, s, 1854, painting, the, gleaners, during, world, war, ii, from, 13, to, 15, february, 1945, the, allies, continuously, bombed, the, city, of, dresden, germany, german, troops, hastily, loaded, artworks, from, dresden, s, galleries, and, museums, onto, trucks, the, stone, breakers, was, destroyed, along, with, 153, other, paintings, when, a, transport, vehicle, moving, the, pictures, to, the, k, nigstein, fortress, near, dresden, was, bombed, by, allied, forces, the, salon, of, 1850, 1851, found, him, triumphant, with, the, stone, breakers, the, peasants, of, flagey, and, a, burial, at, ornans, the, burial, one, of, courbet, s, most, important, works, records, the, funeral, of, his, grand, uncle, which, he, attended, in, september, 1848, people, who, attended, the, funeral, were, the, models, for, the, painting, previously, models, had, been, used, as, actors, in, historical, narratives, but, in, burial, courbet, said, he, painted, the, very, people, who, had, been, present, at, the, interment, all, the, townspeople, the, result, is, a, realistic, presentation, of, them, and, life, in, ornans, the, vast, painting, measuring, 10, by, 22, feet, 3, 0, by, 6, 7, meters, drew, both, praise, and, fierce, denunciations, from, critics, and, the, public, in, part, because, it, upset, convention, by, depicting, a, prosaic, ritual, on, a, scale, which, would, previously, have, been, reserved, for, a, religious, or, royal, subject, according, to, art, historian, sarah, faunce, in, paris, the, burial, was, judged, as, a, work, that, had, thrust, itself, into, the, grand, tradition, of, history, painting, like, an, upstart, in, dirty, boots, crashing, a, genteel, party, and, in, terms, of, that, tradition, it, was, of, course, found, wanting, the, painting, lacks, the, sentimental, rhetoric, that, was, expected, in, a, genre, work, courbet, s, mourners, make, no, theatrical, gestures, of, grief, and, their, faces, seemed, more, caricatured, than, ennobled, the, critics, accused, courbet, of, a, deliberate, pursuit, of, ugliness, eventually, the, public, grew, more, interested, in, the, new, realist, approach, and, the, lavish, decadent, fantasy, of, romanticism, lost, popularity, courbet, well, understood, the, importance, of, the, painting, and, said, of, it, burial, at, ornans, was, in, reality, the, burial, of, romanticism, courbet, became, a, celebrity, and, was, spoken, of, as, a, genius, a, terrible, socialist, and, a, savage, he, actively, encouraged, the, public, s, perception, of, him, as, an, unschooled, peasant, while, his, ambition, his, bold, pronouncements, to, journalists, and, his, insistence, on, depicting, his, own, life, in, his, art, gave, him, a, reputation, for, unbridled, vanity, courbet, associated, his, ideas, of, realism, in, art, with, political, anarchism, and, having, gained, an, audience, he, promoted, political, ideas, by, writing, politically, motivated, essays, and, dissertations, his, familiar, visage, was, the, object, of, frequent, caricature, in, the, popular, french, press, in, 1850, courbet, wrote, to, a, friend, in, our, so, very, civilized, society, it, is, necessary, for, me, to, live, the, life, of, a, savage, i, must, be, free, even, of, governments, the, people, have, my, sympathies, i, must, address, myself, to, them, directly, during, the, 1850s, courbet, painted, numerous, figurative, works, using, common, folk, and, friends, as, his, subjects, such, as, village, damsels, 1852, the, wrestlers, 1853, the, bathers, 1853, the, sleeping, spinner, 1853, and, the, wheat, sifters, 1854, in, 1855, courbet, submitted, fourteen, paintings, for, exhibition, at, the, exposition, universelle, three, were, rejected, for, lack, of, space, including, a, burial, at, ornans, and, his, other, monumental, canvas, the, artist, s, studio, refusing, to, be, denied, courbet, took, matters, into, his, own, hands, he, displayed, forty, of, his, paintings, including, the, artist, s, studio, in, his, gallery, called, the, pavilion, of, realism, pavillon, du, r, alisme, which, was, a, temporary, structure, that, he, erected, next, door, to, the, official, salon, like, exposition, universelle, the, work, is, an, allegory, of, courbet, s, life, as, a, painter, seen, as, a, heroic, venture, in, which, he, is, flanked, by, friends, and, admirers, on, the, right, and, challenges, and, opposition, to, the, left, friends, on, the, right, include, the, art, critics, champfleury, and, charles, baudelaire, and, art, collector, alfred, bruyas, on, the, left, are, figures, priest, prostitute, grave, digger, merchant, and, others, who, represent, what, courbet, described, in, a, letter, to, champfleury, as, the, other, world, of, trivial, life, the, people, misery, poverty, wealth, the, exploited, and, the, exploiters, the, people, who, live, off, death, in, the, foreground, of, the, left, hand, side, is, a, man, with, dogs, who, was, not, mentioned, in, courbet, s, letter, to, champfleury, x, rays, show, he, was, painted, later, but, his, role, in, the, painting, is, important, he, is, an, allegory, of, the, then, current, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, identified, by, his, famous, hunting, dogs, and, iconic, twirled, mustache, by, placing, him, on, the, left, courbet, publicly, shows, his, disdain, for, the, emperor, and, depicts, him, as, a, criminal, suggesting, that, his, ownership, of, france, is, an, illegal, one, although, artists, like, eug, ne, delacroix, were, ardent, champions, of, his, effort, the, public, went, to, the, show, mostly, out, of, curiosity, and, to, deride, him, attendance, and, sales, were, disappointing, but, courbet, s, status, as, a, hero, to, the, french, avant, garde, became, assured, he, was, admired, by, the, american, james, abbott, mcneill, whistler, and, he, became, an, inspiration, to, the, younger, generation, of, french, artists, including, douard, manet, and, the, impressionist, painters, the, artist, s, studio, was, recognized, as, a, masterpiece, by, delacroix, baudelaire, and, champfleury, if, not, by, the, public, while, courbet, s, seascapes, painted, during, his, many, visits, to, the, northern, coast, of, france, in, the, late, 1860s, were, decidedly, less, controversial, than, his, salon, submissions, they, furthered, his, contributions, willing, or, otherwise, to, realism, with, their, emphasis, on, both, the, beauty, and, danger, of, the, natural, world, there, is, a, distinct, range, in, the, tones, of, this, period, with, the, calm, sea, 1869, depicting, the, serenity, of, the, receded, tide, and, the, sailboat, c, 1869, showing, a, sailboat, wrestling, with, violent, tides, courbet, wrote, a, realist, manifesto, for, the, introduction, to, the, catalogue, of, this, independent, personal, exhibition, echoing, the, tone, of, the, period, s, political, manifestos, in, it, he, asserts, his, goal, as, an, artist, is, to, translate, the, customs, the, ideas, the, appearance, of, my, epoch, according, to, my, own, estimation, the, title, of, realist, was, thrust, upon, me, just, as, the, title, of, romantic, was, imposed, upon, the, men, of, 1830, titles, have, never, given, a, true, idea, of, things, if, it, were, otherwise, the, works, would, be, unnecessary, without, expanding, on, the, greater, or, lesser, accuracy, of, a, name, that, nobody, i, should, hope, can, really, be, expected, to, understand, i, will, limit, myself, to, a, few, words, of, elucidation, in, order, to, cut, short, the, misunderstandings, i, have, studied, the, art, of, the, ancients, and, the, art, of, the, moderns, avoiding, any, preconceived, system, and, without, prejudice, i, no, longer, wanted, to, imitate, the, one, than, to, copy, the, other, nor, furthermore, was, it, my, intention, to, attain, the, trivial, goal, of, art, for, art, s, sake, no, i, simply, wanted, to, draw, forth, from, a, complete, acquaintance, with, tradition, the, reasoned, and, independent, consciousness, of, my, own, individuality, to, know, in, order, to, do, that, was, my, idea, to, be, in, a, position, to, translate, the, customs, the, ideas, the, appearance, of, my, time, according, to, my, own, estimation, to, be, not, only, a, painter, but, a, man, as, well, in, short, to, create, living, art, this, is, my, goal, gustave, courbet, 1855, in, the, salon, of, 1857, courbet, showed, six, paintings, these, included, young, ladies, on, the, banks, of, the, seine, summer, depicting, two, prostitutes, under, a, tree, as, well, as, the, first, of, many, hunting, scenes, courbet, was, to, paint, during, the, remainder, of, his, life, hind, at, bay, in, the, snow, and, the, quarry, young, ladies, on, the, banks, of, the, seine, painted, in, 1856, provoked, a, scandal, art, critics, accustomed, to, conventional, timeless, nude, women, in, landscapes, were, shocked, by, courbet, s, depiction, of, modern, women, casually, displaying, their, undergarments, by, exhibiting, sensational, works, alongside, hunting, scenes, of, the, sort, that, had, brought, popular, success, to, the, english, painter, edwin, landseer, courbet, guaranteed, himself, both, notoriety, and, sales, during, the, 1860s, courbet, painted, a, series, of, increasingly, erotic, works, such, as, femme, nue, couch, e, culminating, in, the, origin, of, the, world, l, origine, du, monde, 1866, which, depicts, female, genitalia, and, was, not, publicly, exhibited, until, 1988, and, sleep, 1866, featuring, two, women, in, bed, the, latter, painting, became, the, subject, of, a, police, report, when, it, was, exhibited, by, a, picture, dealer, in, 1872, until, about, 1861, napol, on, s, regime, had, exhibited, authoritarian, characteristics, using, press, censorship, to, prevent, the, spread, of, opposition, manipulating, elections, and, depriving, parliament, of, the, right, to, free, debate, or, any, real, power, in, the, 1860s, however, napol, on, iii, made, more, concessions, to, placate, his, liberal, opponents, this, change, began, by, allowing, free, debates, in, parliament, and, public, reports, of, parliamentary, debates, press, censorship, too, was, relaxed, and, culminated, in, the, appointment, of, the, liberal, mile, ollivier, previously, a, leader, of, the, opposition, to, napol, on, s, regime, as, the, de, facto, prime, minister, in, 1870, as, a, sign, of, appeasement, to, the, liberals, who, admired, courbet, napoleon, iii, nominated, him, to, the, legion, of, honour, in, 1870, his, refusal, of, the, cross, of, the, legion, of, honour, angered, those, in, power, but, made, him, immensely, popular, with, those, who, opposed, the, prevailing, regime, on, 4, september, 1870, during, the, franco, prussian, war, courbet, made, a, proposal, that, later, came, back, to, haunt, him, he, wrote, a, letter, to, the, government, of, national, defense, proposing, that, the, column, in, the, place, vend, me, erected, by, napoleon, i, to, honour, the, victories, of, the, french, army, be, taken, down, he, wrote, in, as, much, as, the, vend, me, column, is, a, monument, devoid, of, all, artistic, value, tending, to, perpetuate, by, its, expression, the, ideas, of, war, and, conquest, of, the, past, imperial, dynasty, which, are, reproved, by, a, republican, nation, s, sentiment, citizen, courbet, expresses, the, wish, that, the, national, defense, government, will, authorize, him, to, disassemble, this, column, courbet, proposed, that, the, column, be, moved, to, a, more, appropriate, place, such, as, the, hotel, des, invalides, a, military, hospital, he, also, wrote, an, open, letter, addressed, to, the, german, army, and, to, german, artists, proposing, that, german, and, french, cannons, should, be, melted, down, and, crowned, with, a, liberty, cap, and, made, into, a, new, monument, on, place, vend, me, dedicated, to, the, federation, of, the, german, and, french, people, the, government, of, national, defense, did, nothing, about, his, suggestion, to, tear, down, the, column, but, it, was, not, forgotten, on, 18, march, in, the, aftermath, of, the, french, defeat, in, the, franco, prussian, war, a, revolutionary, government, called, the, paris, commune, briefly, took, power, in, the, city, courbet, played, an, active, part, and, organized, a, federation, of, artists, which, held, its, first, meeting, on, 5, april, in, the, grand, amphitheater, of, the, school, of, medicine, some, three, hundred, to, four, hundred, painters, sculptors, architects, and, decorators, attended, there, were, some, famous, names, on, the, list, of, members, including, andr, gill, honor, daumier, jean, baptiste, camille, corot, eug, ne, pottier, jules, dalou, and, douard, manet, manet, was, not, in, paris, during, the, commune, and, did, not, attend, and, corot, who, was, seventy, five, years, old, stayed, in, a, country, house, and, his, studio, during, the, commune, not, taking, part, in, the, political, events, courbet, chaired, the, meeting, and, proposed, that, the, louvre, and, the, mus, e, du, luxembourg, the, two, major, art, museums, of, paris, closed, during, the, uprising, be, reopened, as, soon, as, possible, and, that, the, traditional, annual, exhibit, called, the, salon, be, held, as, in, years, past, but, with, radical, differences, he, proposed, that, the, salon, should, be, free, of, any, government, interference, or, rewards, to, preferred, artists, no, medals, or, government, commissions, would, be, given, furthermore, he, called, for, the, abolition, of, the, most, famous, state, institutions, of, french, art, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, the, french, academy, in, rome, the, french, school, at, athens, and, the, fine, arts, section, of, the, institute, of, france, on, 12, april, the, executive, committee, of, the, commune, gave, courbet, though, he, was, not, yet, officially, a, member, of, the, commune, the, assignment, of, opening, the, museums, and, organizing, the, salon, they, issued, the, following, decree, at, the, same, meeting, the, column, of, the, place, vend, me, will, be, demolished, on, 16, april, special, elections, were, held, to, replace, more, moderate, members, of, the, commune, who, had, resigned, their, seats, and, courbet, was, elected, as, a, delegate, for, the, 6th, arrondissement, of, paris, he, was, given, the, title, of, delegate, of, fine, arts, and, on, 21, april, he, was, also, made, a, member, of, the, commission, on, education, at, the, meeting, of, the, commission, on, 27, april, the, minutes, reported, that, courbet, requested, the, demolition, of, the, vend, me, column, be, carried, out, and, that, the, column, would, be, replaced, by, an, allegorical, figure, representing, the, taking, of, power, of, the, commune, on, 18, march, nonetheless, courbet, was, a, dissident, by, nature, and, he, was, soon, in, opposition, with, the, majority, of, the, commune, members, on, some, of, its, measures, he, was, one, of, a, minority, of, commune, members, who, opposed, the, creation, of, a, committee, on, public, safety, modeled, on, the, committee, of, the, same, name, which, carried, out, the, reign, of, terror, during, the, french, revolution, courbet, opposed, the, commune, on, another, more, serious, matter, the, arrest, of, his, friend, gustave, chaudey, a, prominent, socialist, magistrate, and, journalist, whose, portrait, courbet, had, painted, the, popular, commune, newspaper, le, p, re, duchesne, accused, chaudey, when, he, was, briefly, deputy, mayor, of, the, 9th, arrondissement, before, the, commune, was, formed, of, ordering, soldiers, to, fire, on, a, crowd, that, had, surrounded, the, h, tel, de, ville, courbet, s, opposition, was, of, no, use, on, 23, may, 1871, in, the, final, days, of, the, commune, chaudey, was, shot, by, a, commune, firing, squad, according, to, some, sources, courbet, resigned, from, the, commune, in, protest, on, 13, may, on, the, proposal, of, courbet, the, paris, house, of, adolphe, thiers, the, chief, executive, of, the, french, government, was, demolished, and, his, art, collection, confiscated, courbet, proposed, that, the, confiscated, art, be, given, to, the, louvre, and, other, museums, but, the, director, of, the, louvre, refused, to, accept, it, on, 16, may, just, nine, days, before, the, fall, of, the, commune, in, a, large, ceremony, with, military, bands, and, photographers, the, vend, me, column, was, pulled, down, and, broke, into, pieces, some, witnesses, said, courbet, was, there, others, denied, it, the, following, day, the, federation, of, artists, debated, dismissing, directors, of, the, louvre, and, of, the, luxembourg, museums, suspected, by, some, in, the, commune, of, having, secret, contacts, with, the, french, government, and, appointed, new, heads, of, the, museums, according, to, one, legend, courbet, defended, the, louvre, and, other, museums, against, looting, mobs, but, there, are, no, records, of, any, such, attacks, on, the, museums, the, only, real, threat, to, the, louvre, came, during, bloody, week, 21, 28, may, 1871, when, a, unit, of, communards, led, by, a, commune, general, jules, bergeret, set, fire, to, the, tuileries, palace, next, to, the, louvre, the, fire, spread, to, the, library, of, the, louvre, which, was, destroyed, but, the, efforts, of, museum, curators, and, firemen, saved, the, art, gallery, after, the, final, suppression, of, the, commune, by, the, french, army, on, 28, may, courbet, went, into, hiding, in, the, apartments, of, different, friends, he,
