tiberius, julius, caesar, augustus, t, a, b, r, i, s, ty, beer, ee, s, 16, november, 42, bc, 16, march, ad, 37, was, roman, emperor, from, ad, 14, until, 37, he, succeeded, his, stepfather, augustus, the, first, roman, emperor, tiberius, was, born, in, rome, in, 42, bc, to, roman, politician, tiberius, claudius, nero, and, his, wife, livia, drusilla, in, 38, bc, tiberius, s, mother, divorced, his, father, and, married, augustus, following, the, untimely, deaths, of, augustus, s, two, grandsons, and, adopted, heirs, gaius, and, lucius, caesar, tiberius, was, designated, augustus, s, successor, prior, to, this, tiberius, had, proved, himself, an, able, diplomat, and, one, of, the, most, successful, roman, generals, his, conquests, of, pannonia, dalmatia, raetia, and, temporarily, parts, of, germania, laid, the, foundations, for, the, empire, s, northern, frontier, early, in, his, career, tiberius, was, happily, married, to, vipsania, daughter, of, augustus, s, friend, distinguished, general, and, intended, heir, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, they, had, a, son, drusus, julius, caesar, after, agrippa, died, augustus, insisted, that, tiberius, divorce, vipsania, and, marry, his, own, daughter, tiberius, s, step, sister, julia, tiberius, reluctantly, gave, in, this, second, marriage, proved, scandalous, deeply, unhappy, and, childless, ultimately, julia, was, sent, into, exile, by, her, father, tiberius, adopted, his, nephew, the, able, and, popular, germanicus, as, heir, on, augustus, s, death, in, 14, tiberius, became, princeps, at, the, age, of, 55, he, seems, to, have, taken, on, the, responsibilities, of, head, of, state, with, great, reluctance, and, perhaps, a, genuine, sense, of, inadequacy, in, the, role, compared, to, the, capable, self, confident, and, charismatic, augustus, from, the, outset, tiberius, had, a, difficult, resentful, relationship, with, the, senate, and, suspected, many, plots, against, him, nevertheless, he, proved, to, be, an, effective, and, efficient, administrator, after, the, deaths, of, his, nephew, germanicus, in, ad, 19, and, his, son, drusus, in, 23, tiberius, became, reclusive, and, aloof, in, 26, he, removed, himself, from, rome, and, left, administration, largely, in, the, hands, of, his, ambitious, praetorian, prefect, sejanus, whom, he, later, had, executed, for, treason, and, then, sejanus, s, replacement, macro, when, tiberius, died, he, was, succeeded, by, his, grand, nephew, and, adopted, grandson, germanicus, s, son, caligula, whose, lavish, building, projects, and, varyingly, successful, military, endeavours, drained, much, of, the, wealth, that, tiberius, had, accumulated, in, the, public, and, imperial, coffers, through, good, management, tiberius, allowed, the, worship, of, his, divine, genius, in, only, one, temple, in, rome, s, eastern, provinces, and, promoted, restraint, in, the, empire, wide, cult, to, the, deceased, augustus, when, tiberius, died, he, was, given, a, sumptuous, funeral, befitting, his, office, but, no, divine, honours, he, came, to, be, remembered, as, a, dark, reclusive, and, sombre, ruler, who, never, really, wanted, to, be, emperor, pliny, the, elder, called, him, the, gloomiest, of, men, tiberius, was, born, in, rome, on, 16, november, 42, bc, to, tiberius, claudius, nero, and, livia, drusilla, both, of, his, biological, parents, belonged, to, the, gens, claudia, an, ancient, patrician, family, that, came, to, prominence, in, the, early, years, of, the, republic, his, mother, was, also, a, member, of, the, livii, family, an, ancient, plebeian, but, prominent, family, through, the, adoption, into, it, of, his, maternal, grandfather, little, is, recorded, of, tiberius, s, early, life, in, 39, bc, his, mother, divorced, his, biological, father, and, though, again, pregnant, by, tiberius, nero, remarried, to, octavian, later, known, as, augustus, in, 38, bc, his, brother, nero, claudius, drusus, was, born, in, 32, bc, tiberius, at, the, age, of, nine, delivered, the, eulogy, for, his, biological, father, at, the, rostra, in, 29, bc, he, rode, in, the, triumphal, chariot, along, with, his, adoptive, father, octavian, in, celebration, of, the, defeat, of, antony, and, cleopatra, at, actium, in, 23, bc, emperor, augustus, became, gravely, ill, and, his, possible, death, threatened, to, plunge, the, roman, world, into, even, more, civil, conflict, historians, generally, agree, that, it, is, during, this, time, that, the, question, of, augustus, s, heir, became, most, acute, and, while, augustus, had, seemed, to, indicate, that, agrippa, and, marcellus, would, carry, on, his, position, in, the, event, of, his, death, the, ambiguity, of, succession, became, augustus, s, chief, problem, in, response, a, series, of, potential, heirs, seem, to, have, been, selected, among, them, tiberius, and, his, brother, drusus, in, 24, bc, at, the, age, of, seventeen, tiberius, entered, politics, under, augustus, s, direction, receiving, the, position, of, quaestor, and, was, granted, the, right, to, stand, for, election, as, praetor, and, consul, five, years, in, advance, of, the, age, required, by, law, similar, provisions, were, made, for, drusus, shortly, thereafter, tiberius, began, appearing, in, court, as, an, advocate, and, it, was, presumably, at, this, time, that, his, interest, in, greek, rhetoric, began, in, 20, bc, tiberius, went, east, to, join, augustus, the, parthian, empire, had, previously, captured, the, standards, of, the, legions, under, the, command, of, marcus, licinius, crassus, 53, bc, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, decidius, saxa, 40, bc, and, mark, antony, 36, bc, and, after, negotiations, with, parthia, s, king, phraates, iv, either, augustus, or, tiberius, or, perhaps, both, together, were, able, to, reclaim, them, for, rome, tiberius, then, led, a, sizeable, force, into, armenia, presumably, to, establish, it, as, a, roman, client, state, and, end, the, threat, it, posed, on, the, roman, parthian, border, augustus, was, able, to, reach, a, compromise, whereby, the, standards, were, returned, and, armenia, remained, a, neutral, territory, between, the, two, powers, tiberius, married, vipsania, agrippina, the, daughter, of, augustus, s, close, friend, and, most, famed, general, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, he, was, appointed, to, the, position, of, praetor, and, was, sent, with, his, legions, to, assist, his, brother, drusus, in, campaigns, in, the, west, while, drusus, focused, his, forces, in, gallia, narbonensis, and, along, the, german, frontier, tiberius, combated, the, tribes, in, the, alps, and, within, transalpine, gaul, conquering, raetia, in, 15, bc, he, discovered, the, sources, of, the, danube, and, soon, afterward, the, bend, of, the, middle, course, returning, to, rome, in, 13, bc, tiberius, was, appointed, as, consul, and, around, this, same, time, his, son, drusus, julius, caesar, was, born, agrippa, s, death, in, 12, bc, elevated, tiberius, and, drusus, with, respect, to, the, succession, at, augustus, s, request, in, 11, bc, tiberius, divorced, vipsania, and, married, julia, the, elder, augustus, s, daughter, and, agrippa, s, widow, tiberius, was, very, reluctant, to, do, this, as, julia, had, made, advances, to, him, when, she, was, married, and, tiberius, was, happily, married, his, new, marriage, with, julia, was, happy, at, first, but, turned, sour, suetonius, claims, that, when, tiberius, ran, into, vipsania, again, he, followed, her, home, crying, and, begging, forgiveness, soon, afterwards, tiberius, met, with, augustus, and, steps, were, taken, to, ensure, that, tiberius, and, vipsania, would, never, meet, again, tiberius, continued, to, be, elevated, by, augustus, and, after, agrippa, s, death, and, his, brother, drusus, s, death, in, 9, bc, seemed, the, clear, candidate, for, succession, as, such, in, 12, bc, he, received, military, commissions, in, pannonia, and, germania, both, areas, highly, volatile, and, of, key, importance, to, augustan, policy, in, 6, bc, tiberius, launched, a, pincer, movement, against, the, marcomanni, setting, out, northwest, from, carnuntum, on, the, danube, with, four, legions, tiberius, passed, through, quadi, territory, in, order, to, invade, marcomanni, territory, from, the, east, meanwhile, general, gaius, sentius, saturninus, would, depart, east, from, moguntiacum, on, the, rhine, with, two, or, three, legions, pass, through, newly, annexed, hermunduri, territory, and, attack, the, marcomanni, from, the, west, the, campaign, was, a, resounding, success, but, tiberius, could, not, subjugate, the, marcomanni, because, he, was, soon, summoned, to, the, rhine, frontier, to, protect, rome, s, new, conquests, in, germania, he, returned, to, rome, and, was, consul, for, a, second, time, in, 7, bc, and, in, 6, bc, was, granted, tribunician, power, tribunicia, potestas, and, control, in, the, east, positions, that, agrippa, had, held, before, him, in, 6, bc, while, on, the, verge, of, accepting, command, in, the, east, and, becoming, the, second, most, powerful, man, in, rome, tiberius, announced, his, withdrawal, from, politics, and, retired, to, rhodes, the, motives, for, tiberius, s, withdrawal, are, unclear, some, historians, have, speculated, that, tiberius, and, drusus, were, only, ever, intended, as, caretakers, and, would, have, been, swept, aside, once, julia, s, two, sons, by, agrippa, gaius, and, lucius, were, adopted, as, augustus, s, heirs, and, came, of, age, the, promiscuous, and, very, public, behaviour, of, his, unhappily, married, wife, julia, may, have, also, played, a, part, tacitus, understood, this, to, be, tiberius, s, innermost, reason, for, moving, to, rhodes, a, reflection, of, his, hatred, of, julia, and, his, longing, for, vipsania, tiberius, forbidden, to, see, the, woman, he, loved, found, himself, married, to, a, woman, he, loathed, and, publicly, humiliated, by, her, nighttime, escapades, in, the, roman, forum, whatever, tiberius, s, motives, his, withdrawal, was, almost, disastrous, for, augustus, s, succession, plans, gaius, and, lucius, were, still, in, their, early, teens, and, augustus, now, 57, years, old, had, no, immediate, successor, there, was, no, longer, a, guarantee, of, a, peaceful, transfer, of, power, after, augustus, s, death, nor, a, guarantee, that, his, family, and, therefore, his, family, s, allies, would, continue, to, hold, power, should, the, position, of, princeps, survive, somewhat, melodramatic, stories, tell, of, augustus, pleading, with, tiberius, to, stay, even, going, so, far, as, to, stage, a, serious, illness, tiberius, s, response, was, to, anchor, off, the, shore, of, ostia, until, word, came, that, augustus, had, survived, then, sailing, straightway, for, rhodes, tiberius, reportedly, regretted, his, departure, and, requested, to, return, to, rome, several, times, but, each, time, augustus, refused, his, requests, with, tiberius, s, departure, succession, rested, solely, on, augustus, s, two, young, grandsons, lucius, and, gaius, caesar, the, situation, became, more, precarious, in, ad, 2, with, the, death, of, lucius, augustus, with, perhaps, some, pressure, from, livia, allowed, tiberius, to, return, to, rome, as, a, private, citizen, and, nothing, more, in, ad, 4, gaius, was, killed, in, armenia, and, augustus, had, no, other, choice, but, to, turn, to, tiberius, the, death, of, gaius, initiated, a, flurry, of, activity, in, the, household, of, augustus, tiberius, was, adopted, in, 26, june, as, full, son, and, heir, and, in, turn, he, was, required, to, adopt, his, nephew, germanicus, the, son, of, his, brother, nero, claudius, drusus, and, augustus, s, niece, antonia, minor, along, with, his, adoption, tiberius, received, tribunician, power, as, well, as, a, share, of, augustus, s, maius, imperium, something, that, even, marcus, agrippa, may, never, have, had, in, ad, 7, agrippa, postumus, a, younger, brother, of, gaius, and, lucius, was, disowned, by, augustus, and, banished, to, the, island, of, pianosa, to, live, in, solitary, confinement, thus, when, in, ad, 13, the, powers, held, by, tiberius, were, made, equal, rather, than, second, to, augustus, s, own, powers, he, was, for, all, intents, and, purposes, a, co, princeps, with, augustus, and, in, the, event, of, the, latter, s, passing, would, simply, continue, to, rule, without, an, interregnum, or, possible, upheaval, however, according, to, suetonius, after, a, two, year, stint, in, germania, which, lasted, from, ad, 10, 12, tiberius, returned, and, celebrated, the, triumph, which, he, had, postponed, accompanied, also, by, his, generals, for, whom, he, had, obtained, the, triumphal, regalia, and, before, turning, to, enter, the, capitol, he, dismounted, from, his, chariot, and, fell, at, the, knees, of, his, father, who, was, presiding, over, the, ceremonies, since, the, consuls, caused, a, law, to, be, passed, soon, after, this, that, he, should, govern, the, provinces, jointly, with, augustus, and, hold, the, census, with, him, he, set, out, for, illyricum, on, the, conclusion, of, the, lustral, ceremonies, thus, according, to, suetonius, these, ceremonies, and, the, declaration, of, his, co, princeps, took, place, in, the, year, ad, 12, after, tiberius, s, return, from, germania, but, he, was, at, once, recalled, and, finding, augustus, in, his, last, illness, but, still, alive, he, spent, an, entire, day, with, him, in, private, augustus, died, on, 19, august, ad, 14, a, month, before, his, 76th, birthday, and, exactly, 56, years, after, he, first, assumed, the, consulship, he, was, cremated, with, all, due, ceremony, and, as, had, been, arranged, beforehand, deified, his, will, read, and, tiberius, now, a, middle, aged, man, at, 55, was, confirmed, as, his, sole, surviving, heir, tiberius, peacefully, took, power, unchallenged, by, any, rivals, the, senate, convened, on, 17, september, to, validate, tiberius, s, position, as, princeps, and, as, it, had, done, with, augustus, before, grant, him, its, powers, tiberius, already, had, the, administrative, and, political, powers, of, the, princeps, but, he, lacked, the, titles, of, augustus, and, pater, patriae, father, of, the, country, and, refused, the, civic, crown, like, augustus, before, him, tiberius, may, have, sought, to, represent, himself, as, a, reluctant, yet, devoted, public, servant, no, more, than, an, ordinary, citizen, who, wanted, to, serve, the, state, and, people, to, the, best, of, his, ability, but, his, refusal, of, these, titular, quasi, religious, honours, and, his, reluctance, to, accept, the, full, powers, of, a, princeps, were, taken, as, insults, to, the, elite, who, offered, them, signs, of, hypocrisy, not, humility, according, to, tacitus, tiberius, derided, the, senate, as, men, fit, to, be, slaves, antagonism, between, tiberius, and, his, senate, seems, to, have, been, a, feature, of, his, rule, in, his, first, few, years, as, emperor, tiberius, seems, to, have, wanted, the, senate, to, act, alone, with, no, reference, to, him, or, his, responsibilities, as, first, senator, his, direct, orders, were, rather, vague, inspiring, debates, on, what, he, actually, meant, rather, than, passing, his, legislation, the, roman, legions, in, pannonia, and, germania, had, not, been, paid, the, bonuses, promised, to, them, by, augustus, and, showed, early, signs, of, mutiny, when, it, was, clear, that, a, response, from, tiberius, was, not, forthcoming, germanicus, and, tiberius, s, son, drusus, julius, caesar, were, dispatched, with, a, small, force, to, quell, the, uprising, and, bring, the, legions, back, in, line, germanicus, took, charge, of, the, mutinous, troops, and, led, them, on, a, short, campaign, across, the, rhine, into, germanic, territory, promising, that, whatever, treasure, they, could, grab, would, count, as, their, bonus, germanicus, s, forces, took, over, all, the, territory, between, the, rhine, and, the, elbe, they, took, control, of, the, teutoburg, forest, where, three, roman, legions, and, their, auxiliary, cohorts, led, by, publius, quinctilius, varus, had, been, annihilated, by, germanic, tribes, several, years, before, germanicus, took, back, the, legionary, standards, lost, in, that, disaster, saving, them, from, the, disgrace, of, captivity, these, bold, and, successful, actions, increased, germanicus, s, already, high, popular, standing, after, his, return, to, rome, germanicus, was, awarded, a, full, triumph, which, he, celebrated, in, ad, 17, it, was, the, first, full, triumph, held, since, augustus, s, own, in, 29, bc, in, ad, 18, germanicus, was, granted, control, over, the, eastern, part, of, the, empire, like, agrippa, and, tiberius, before, him, this, was, interpreted, as, a, sign, that, he, would, be, tiberius, s, successor, but, germanicus, died, just, over, a, year, later, having, accused, gnaeus, calpurnius, piso, the, governor, of, syria, of, poisoning, him, the, pisones, had, been, longtime, supporters, of, the, claudians, and, had, allied, themselves, with, the, young, octavian, after, his, marriage, to, livia, the, mother, of, tiberius, germanicus, s, death, and, accusations, indicted, the, new, princeps, piso, was, placed, on, trial, and, according, to, tacitus, threatened, to, implicate, tiberius, whether, the, governor, actually, could, connect, the, princeps, to, the, death, of, germanicus, is, unknown, rather, than, continuing, to, stand, trial, when, it, became, evident, that, the, senate, was, against, him, piso, committed, suicide, in, ad, 22, tiberius, shared, his, tribunician, authority, with, his, son, drusus, and, began, making, yearly, excursions, to, campania, that, reportedly, became, longer, and, longer, every, year, in, ad, 23, drusus, died, in, mysterious, circumstances, and, tiberius, seems, to, have, made, no, effort, to, elevate, a, replacement, in, ad, 26, tiberius, moved, to, an, imperial, villa, complex, he, had, inherited, from, augustus, on, the, island, of, capri, it, was, just, off, the, coast, of, campania, which, was, a, traditional, holiday, retreat, for, rome, s, upper, classes, particularly, those, who, valued, cultured, leisure, otium, and, a, hellenised, lifestyle, lucius, aelius, sejanus, had, served, the, imperial, family, for, almost, twenty, years, when, he, became, praetorian, prefect, in, ad, 15, as, tiberius, became, more, embittered, with, the, position, of, princeps, he, began, to, depend, more, and, more, upon, the, limited, secretariat, left, to, him, by, augustus, and, specifically, upon, sejanus, and, the, praetorians, in, ad, 17, or, 18, tiberius, had, trimmed, the, ranks, of, the, praetorian, guard, responsible, for, the, defence, of, the, city, and, had, moved, it, from, encampments, outside, of, the, city, walls, into, the, city, itself, giving, sejanus, access, to, somewhere, between, 6000, and, 9000, troops, the, death, of, drusus, elevated, sejanus, at, least, in, the, eyes, of, tiberius, who, thereafter, refers, to, him, as, his, socius, laborum, partner, of, my, labours, tiberius, had, statues, of, sejanus, erected, throughout, the, city, and, sejanus, became, more, and, more, visible, as, tiberius, began, to, withdraw, from, rome, altogether, finally, with, tiberius, s, withdrawal, in, ad, 26, sejanus, was, left, in, charge, of, the, entire, state, mechanism, and, the, city, of, rome, sejanus, s, position, was, not, quite, that, of, successor, he, had, requested, marriage, in, ad, 25, to, tiberius, s, niece, livilla, though, under, pressure, quickly, withdrew, the, request, while, sejanus, s, praetorians, controlled, the, imperial, post, and, therefore, the, information, that, tiberius, received, from, rome, and, the, information, rome, received, from, tiberius, the, presence, of, livia, seems, to, have, checked, his, overt, power, for, a, time, her, death, in, ad, 29, changed, all, that, sejanus, began, a, series, of, purge, trials, of, senators, and, wealthy, equestrians, in, the, city, of, rome, removing, those, capable, of, opposing, his, power, as, well, as, extending, the, imperial, and, his, own, treasury, germanicus, s, widow, agrippina, the, elder, and, two, of, her, sons, nero, julius, caesar, and, drusus, caesar, were, arrested, and, exiled, in, ad, 30, and, later, all, died, in, suspicious, circumstances, in, sejanus, s, purge, of, agrippina, the, elder, and, her, family, caligula, agrippina, the, younger, julia, drusilla, and, julia, livilla, were, the, only, survivors, in, 31, sejanus, held, the, consulship, with, tiberius, in, absentia, and, began, his, play, for, power, in, earnest, precisely, what, happened, is, difficult, to, determine, but, sejanus, seems, to, have, covertly, attempted, to, court, those, families, who, were, tied, to, the, julians, and, attempted, to, ingratiate, himself, with, the, julian, family, line, to, place, himself, as, an, adopted, julian, in, the, position, of, princeps, or, as, a, possible, regent, livilla, was, later, implicated, in, this, plot, and, was, revealed, to, have, been, sejanus, s, lover, for, several, years, the, plot, seems, to, have, involved, the, two, of, them, overthrowing, tiberius, with, the, support, of, the, julians, and, either, assuming, the, principate, themselves, or, serving, as, regent, to, the, young, tiberius, gemellus, or, possibly, even, caligula, those, who, stood, in, his, way, were, tried, for, treason, and, swiftly, dealt, with, in, ad, 31, sejanus, was, summoned, to, a, meeting, of, the, senate, where, a, letter, from, tiberius, was, read, condemning, sejanus, and, ordering, his, immediate, execution, sejanus, was, tried, and, he, and, several, of, his, colleagues, were, executed, within, the, week, as, commander, of, the, praetorian, guard, he, was, replaced, by, naevius, sutorius, macro, tacitus, claims, that, more, treason, trials, followed, and, that, whereas, tiberius, had, been, hesitant, to, act, at, the, outset, of, his, reign, now, towards, the, end, of, his, life, he, seemed, to, do, so, without, compunction, the, hardest, hit, were, those, families, with, political, ties, to, the, julians, even, the, imperial, magistracy, was, hit, as, any, and, all, who, had, associated, with, sejanus, or, could, in, some, way, be, tied, to, his, schemes, were, summarily, tried, and, executed, their, properties, seized, by, the, state, as, tacitus, vividly, describes, executions, were, now, a, stimulus, to, his, fury, and, he, ordered, the, death, of, all, who, were, lying, in, prison, under, accusation, of, complicity, with, sejanus, there, lay, singly, or, in, heaps, the, unnumbered, dead, of, every, age, and, sex, the, illustrious, with, the, obscure, kinsfolk, and, friends, were, not, allowed, to, be, near, them, to, weep, over, them, or, even, to, gaze, on, them, too, long, spies, were, set, round, them, who, noted, the, sorrow, of, each, mourner, and, followed, the, rotting, corpses, till, they, were, dragged, to, the, tiber, where, floating, or, driven, on, the, bank, no, one, dared, to, burn, or, to, touch, them, however, tacitus, s, portrayal, of, a, tyrannical, vengeful, emperor, has, been, challenged, by, some, historians, edward, togo, salmon, notes, in, a, history, of, the, roman, world, in, the, whole, twenty, two, years, of, tiberius, s, reign, not, more, than, fifty, two, persons, were, accused, of, treason, of, whom, almost, half, escaped, conviction, while, the, four, innocent, people, to, be, condemned, fell, victims, to, the, excessive, zeal, of, the, senate, not, to, the, emperor, s, tyranny, while, tiberius, was, in, capri, rumours, abounded, as, to, what, exactly, he, was, doing, there, suetonius, records, the, rumours, of, lurid, tales, of, sexual, perversity, including, graphic, depictions, of, child, molestation, cruelty, and, most, of, all, his, paranoia, while, heavily, sensationalised, suetonius, s, stories, at, least, paint, a, picture, of, how, tiberius, was, perceived, by, the, roman, senatorial, class, and, what, his, impact, on, the, principate, was, during, his, 23, years, of, rule, the, affair, of, sejanus, and, the, final, years, of, treason, trials, permanently, damaged, tiberius, s, image, and, reputation, after, sejanus, s, fall, tiberius, s, withdrawal, from, rome, was, complete, the, empire, continued, to, run, under, the, inertia, of, the, bureaucracy, established, by, augustus, rather, than, through, the, leadership, of, the, princeps, suetonius, records, that, he, became, paranoid, and, spent, a, great, deal, of, time, brooding, over, the, death, of, his, son, during, this, period, there, was, a, short, invasion, by, parthia, and, incursions, on, roman, territories, by, dacian, and, germanic, tribes, little, was, done, to, plan, or, secure, tiberius, s, succession, the, julians, and, their, supporters, were, diminished, in, numbers, and, political, influence, thanks, to, sejanus, and, tiberius, s, immediate, heirs, were, dead, caligula, the, sole, surviving, son, of, germanicus, or, tiberius, s, own, grandson, tiberius, gemellus, were, possibly, candidates, however, tiberius, only, made, a, half, hearted, attempt, at, the, end, of, his, life, to, make, caligula, a, quaestor, and, thus, give, him, some, credibility, as, a, possible, successor, while, gemellus, himself, was, still, only, a, teenager, and, thus, completely, unsuitable, for, some, years, to, come, tiberius, died, in, misenum, on, 16, march, ad, 37, months, before, his, 78th, birthday, while, ancient, sources, agree, on, the, date, and, location, of, his, death, contradictory, accounts, exist, of, the, precise, circumstances, tacitus, relates, that, the, emperor, appeared, to, have, stopped, breathing, and, that, caligula, who, was, at, tiberius, s, villa, was, being, congratulated, on, his, succession, to, the, empire, when, news, arrived, that, the, emperor, had, revived, and, was, recovering, his, faculties, he, goes, on, to, report, that, those, who, had, moments, before, recognized, caligula, as, augustus, fled, in, fear, of, the, emperor, s, wrath, while, macro, took, advantage, of, the, chaos, to, have, tiberius, smothered, with, his, own, bedclothes, suetonius, reports, that, upon, recovering, after, an, illness, and, finding, himself, deserted, by, his, attendants, tiberius, attempted, to, rise, from, his, couch, but, fell, dead, suetonius, further, reports, several, rumours, including, that, the, emperor, had, been, poisoned, by, caligula, starved, and, smothered, with, a, pillow, seneca, the, elder, also, reports, tiberius, having, died, a, natural, death, according, to, cassius, dio, caligula, fearing, that, the, emperor, would, recover, refused, tiberius, s, requests, for, food, insisting, that, he, needed, warmth, not, food, then, assisted, by, macro, he, smothered, the, emperor, in, his, bedclothes, neither, josephus, pliny, nor, philo, relate, the, story, of, tiberius, s, suffocation, stating, simply, the, date, of, his, death, and, or, the, length, of, his, reign, modern, medical, analysis, has, concluded, tiberius, most, likely, died, as, a, result, of, myocardial, infarction, after, his, death, the, senate, refused, to, vote, tiberius, the, divine, honours, that, had, been, paid, to, augustus, and, mobs, filled, the, streets, yelling, to, the, tiber, with, tiberius, the, bodies, of, criminals, were, typically, thrown, into, the, river, instead, of, being, buried, or, burnt, however, the, emperor, was, cremated, and, his, ashes, were, placed, in, the, mausoleum, of, augustus, in, his, will, tiberius, nominated, caligula, and, tiberius, gemellus, as, his, joint, heirs, caligula, s, first, act, on, becoming, princeps, was, to, void, tiberius, s, will, suetonius, describes, tiberius, as, being, pale, skinned, broad, shouldered, left, handed, and, exceptionally, strong, and, tall, for, a, roman, although, he, had, poor, posture, suetonius, and, paterculus, both, write, that, as, a, young, man, he, was, considered, attractive, by, roman, beauty, standards, even, in, adulthood, he, was, prone, to, severe, acne, outbreaks, he, wore, his, hair, cut, short, at, the, front, and, sides, but, long, in, the, back, so, it, covered, the, nape, of, his, neck, in, a, style, similar, to, the, mullet, which, suetonius, claims, was, a, family, tradition, of, the, claudian, gens, this, assertion, is, confirmed, by, busts, of, other, claudian, men, who, were, depicted, with, the, same, hairstyle, suetonius, describes, his, eyes, as, being, larger, than, average, while, a, passage, in, pliny, indicates, they, were, grey, or, blue, grey, polychromy, restoration, on, a, bust, of, tiberius, depict, him, with, grey, eyes, and, hair, suetonius, reports, he, tended, to, talk, with, his, hands, a, habit, others, found, unnerving, and, which, augustus, saw, as, an, inherent, character, flaw, both, cassius, dio, and, tacitus, record, that, by, the, time, he, became, emperor, tiberius, had, gone, bald, tacitus, further, reports, that, the, emperor, had, lost, most, of, his, body, fat, and, become, abnormally, thin, although, he, retained, his, physical, strength, he, also, contracted, a, disfiguring, facial, ailment, which, may, have, been, a, severe, case, of, herpes, an, outbreak, of, which, affected, the, empire, during, his, reign, tiberius, banned, kissing, at, public, functions, in, an, effort, to, curtail, its, spread, tacitus, believed, that, embarrassment, over, his, baldness, and, the, disfigurement, of, his, face, may, have, been, contributing, factors, to, his, retreat, to, capri, and, noted, that, he, regularly, attempted, to, cover, his, sores, with, plaster, despite, this, suetonius, reports, that, tiberius, enjoyed, good, general, health, for, the, duration, of, his, reign, late, in, life, he, suffered, from, a, poor, pulse, which, modern, scholars, believe, may, have, been, a, sign, of, heart, disease, shortly, before, his, death, he, suffered, an, injury, to, his, back, while, killing, a, boar, with, a, javelin, to, open, soldiers, games, which, severely, limited, his, mobility, in, his, final, days, since, the, 20th, century, much, scholarship, has, been, dedicated, to, tiberius, s, psychological, profile, modern, assessments, tend, to, agree, that, he, likely, suffered, from, lifelong, major, depressive, disorder, additionally, while, wine, consumption, was, a, regular, part, of, roman, life, contemporary, sources, note, he, consumed, more, than, was, considered, healthy, by, roman, standards, in, the, legions, he, earned, the, nickname, biberius, this, has, lead, modern, writers, to, conclude, he, probably, suffered, from, alcoholism, as, the, julio, claudian, emperor, who, saw, the, most, frontlines, combat, and, the, one, who, actually, lead, troops, into, battle, modern, writers, have, concluded, tiberus, erratic, and, paranoid, behavior, later, in, life, as, well, as, his, alcohol, intake, may, have, been, the, result, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, proponents, of, this, theory, believe, the, tales, of, tiberius, s, lurid, sexual, exploits, were, contemporary, exaggerations, of, sexual, compulsivity, as, a, means, of, coping, with, untreated, trauma, other, modern, diagnoses, offered, for, tiberius, include, obsessive, compulsive, personality, disorder, and, schizoid, personality, disorder, the, latter, diagnoses, was, offered, by, gregorio, mara, n, in, a, book, length, psychological, assessment, of, the, emperor, which, further, argued, he, suffered, from, some, kind, of, anxiety, disorder, had, he, died, before, ad, 23, he, might, have, been, hailed, as, an, exemplary, ruler, despite, the, overwhelmingly, negative, characterisation, left, by, roman, historians, tiberius, left, the, imperial, treasury, with, nearly, 3, billion, sesterces, upon, his, death, rather, than, embark, on, costly, campaigns, of, conquest, he, chose, to, strengthen, the, existing, empire, by, building, additional, bases, using, diplomacy, as, well, as, military, threats, and, generally, refraining, from, getting, drawn, into, petty, squabbles, between, competing, frontier, tyrants, the, result, was, a, stronger, more, consolidated, empire, ensuring, the, imperial, institutions, introduced, by, his, adoptive, father, would, remain, for, centuries, to, come, of, the, authors, whose, texts, have, survived, only, four, describe, the, reign, of, tiberius, in, considerable, detail, tacitus, suetonius, cassius, dio, and, marcus, velleius, paterculus, fragmentary, evidence, also, remains, from, pliny, the, elder, strabo, and, seneca, the, elder, philo, of, alexandria, speaks, briefly, of, tiberius, s, reign, in, embassy, to, gaius, tiberius, himself, wrote, an, autobiography, which, suetonius, describes, as, brief, and, sketchy, but, this, book, has, been, lost, the, most, detailed, account, of, this, period, was, written, by, tacitus, whose, annals, dedicate, the, first, six, books, entirely, to, the, reign, of, tiberius, tacitus, was, a, roman, senator, born, during, the, reign, of, nero, in, ad, 56, and, consul, suffectus, in, ad, 97, his, text, is, largely, based, on, the, acta, senatus, the, minutes, of, the, session, of, the, senate, and, the, acta, diurna, a, collection, of, the, acts, of, the, government, and, news, of, the, court, and, capital, as, well, as, speeches, by, tiberius, himself, and, the, histories, of, contemporaries, such, as, marcus, cluvius, rufus, fabius, rusticus, and, pliny, the, elder, all, of, which, are, lost, tacitus, s, narrative, emphasises, both, political, and, psychological, motivation, his, characterisation, of, tiberius, throughout, the, first, six, books, is, mostly, negative, and, gradually, worsens, as, his, rule, declines, identifying, a, clear, breaking, point, with, the, death, of, his, son, drusus, in, ad, 23, tacitus, describes, julio, claudian, rule, as, generally, unjust, and, criminal, he, attributes, the, apparent, virtues, of, tiberius, during, his, early, reign, to, hypocrisy, another, major, recurring, theme, concerns, the, balance, of, power, between, the, senate, and, the, emperors, corruption, and, the, growing, tyranny, among, the, governing, classes, of, rome, a, substantial, amount, of, his, account, on, tiberius, is, therefore, devoted, to, the, treason, trials, and, persecutions, following, the, revival, of, the, maiestas, law, under, augustus, ultimately, tacitus, s, opinion, on, tiberius, is, best, illustrated, by, his, conclusion, of, the, sixth, book, his, character, too, had, its, distinct, periods, it, was, a, bright, time, in, his, life, and, reputation, while, under, augustus, he, was, a, private, citizen, or, held, high, offices, a, time, of, reserve, and, crafty, assumption, of, virtue, as, long, as, germanicus, and, drusus, were, alive, again, while, his, mother, lived, he, was, a, compound, of, good, and, evil, he, was, infamous, for, his, cruelty, though, he, veiled, his, debaucheries, while, he, loved, or, feared, sejanus, finally, he, plunged, into, every, wickedness, and, disgrace, when, fear, and, shame, being, cast, off, he, simply, indulged, his, own, inclinations, suetonius, was, an, equestrian, who, held, administrative, posts, during, the, reigns, of, trajan, and, hadrian, the, twelve, caesars, details, a, biographical, history, of, the, principate, from, the, birth, of, julius, caesar, to, the, death, of, domitian, in, ad, 96, like, tacitus, he, drew, upon, the, imperial, archives, as, well, as, histories, by, aufidius, bassus, marcus, cluvius, rufus, fabius, rusticus, and, augustus, s, own, letters, his, account, is, more, sensationalist, and, anecdotal, than, that, of, his, contemporary, tacitus, and, delves, into, tiberius, s, numerous, alleged, debaucheries, while, at, capri, nevertheless, suetonius, praises, tiberius, s, actions, during, his, early, reign, emphasising, his, modesty, one, of, the, few, surviving, sources, contemporary, with, the, rule, of, tiberius, comes, from, velleius, paterculus, who, served, under, tiberius, for, eight, years, from, ad, 4, in, germany, and, pannonia, as, praefect, of, cavalry, and, legatus, paterculus, compendium, of, roman, history, spans, a, period, from, the, fall, of, troy, to, the, death, of, livia, in, ad, 29, his, text, on, tiberius, lavishes, praise, on, both, the, emperor, and, sejanus, how, much, of, this, is, due, to, genuine, admiration, or, prudence, remains, an, open, question, but, it, has, been, conjectured, that, he, was, put, to, death, in, ad, 31, as, a, friend, of, sejanus, according, to, the, gospels, jesus, of, nazareth, preached, and, was, executed, during, the, reign, of, tiberius, by, the, authority, of, pontius, pilate, the, roman, governor, of, judaea, province, luke, 3, 1, states, that, john, the, baptist, entered, on, his, public, ministry, in, the, fifteenth, year, of, tiberius, s, reign, the, city, of, tiberias, on, the, western, shore, of, the, sea, of, galilee, also, known, as, the, sea, of, tiberias, was, named, thus, by, herod, antipas, in, tiberius, s, honour, it, is, referred, to, in, john, 6, 23, and, john, 6, 1, the, so, called, tribute, penny, referred, to,

it, unthinkable, that, tiberius, was, aware, of, christianity, as, a, faith, separate, from, judaism, most, scholars, believe, that, roman, distinction, between, jews, and, christians, began, in, the, 40s, in, caligula, s, reign, and, was, complete, by, around, ad, 70, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, the, early, christian, church, s, view, of, tiberius, has, generally, been, favourable, the, 2nd, 3rd, century, christian, apologist, tertullian, said, tiberius, approached, the, senate, with, a, request, to, acknowledge, christ, as, a, deity, citing, evidence, of, his, miracles, and, his, resurrection, following, his, crucifixion, early, church, historian, eusebius, said, pilate, reported, to, tiberius, of, the, resurrection, of, christ, tiberius, is, said, to, have, taken, pilate, s,
