1930s, west, continued, to, write, plays, including, the, wicked, age, pleasure, man, and, the, constant, sinner, her, productions, predictably, aroused, controversy, which, ensured, that, she, stayed, in, the, news, and, often, resulted, in, packed, houses, at, her, performances, her, 1928, play, diamond, lil, a, story, about, a, racy, easygoing, and, ultimately, very, smart, lady, of, the, 1890s, became, a, broadway, hit, and, cemented, west, s, image, in, the, public, s, eye, this, show, had, an, enduring, popularity, and, west, successfully, revived, it, many, times, throughout, the, course, of, her, career, three, years, after, the, initial, success, of, diamond, lil, west, portrayed, another, sexually, charged, character, babe, gordon, in, the, constant, sinner, which, opened, on, broadway, at, the, royale, theatre, on, september, 14, 1931, the, influential, drama, critic, for, the, new, york, times, j, brooks, atkinson, was, among, many, reviewers, at, the, time, who, bashed, the, play, s, storyline, as, well, as, west, s, performance, atkinson, s, scathing, assessment, of, her, three, act, production, was, published, in, the, times, the, day, after, the, dramedy, s, premiere, the, constant, sinner, commits, one, of, the, major, sins, in, the, theatre, it, is, dull, this, is, a, sin, which, is, common, to, all, of, miss, west, s, wonderworks, except, diamond, lil, but, because, of, the, luridness, of, the, hokum, plot, and, the, highly, colored, melodramatic, backgrounds, of, the, new, piece, it, has, seldom, been, more, in, evidence, the, constant, sinner, is, also, as, might, be, expected, vile, as, to, speech, seldom, come, to, think, about, it, has, fouler, talk, been, heard, on, the, broadway, stage, even, in, these, frank, and, forward, times, however, creditable, an, impersonator, of, scarlet, roles, miss, west, may, be, variety, of, attack, is, not, among, her, qualifications, as, an, actress, her, peculiar, slouching, about, the, stage, which, seems, to, provide, firsthand, evidence, that, as, the, program, says, she, originated, the, shimmy, dance, her, vocal, stunts, her, exploitation, of, blond, buxomness, all, these, grow, pretty, tiresome, through, repetition, other, prominent, reviewers, in, 1931, like, atkinson, roundly, criticized, the, stage, production, calling, it, a, clumsy, drama, deliberately, outlandish, and, labeling, west, herself, as, an, atrocious, playwright, ultimately, the, elaborate, play, closed, on, broadway, after, just, eight, weeks, and, 64, performances, when, compared, to, diamond, lil, which, had, run, for, nine, months, with, 323, performances, the, constant, sinner, was, critically, financially, and, personally, a, disappointment, for, west, nevertheless, its, notoriety, and, even, its, negative, reviews, further, enhanced, her, public, image, as, a, daring, sensational, performer, and, brought, her, additional, widespread, media, attention, during, that, time, in, the, months, after, the, play, closed, west, decided, to, put, her, stage, career, on, hold, and, to, accept, a, short, term, but, lucrative, contract, offer, from, paramount, pictures, to, perform, in, a, feature, film, in, hollywood, in, june, 1932, after, signing, a, two, month, contract, with, paramount, that, provided, her, a, weekly, salary, of, 5, 000, 110, 000, in, 2023, west, left, new, york, by, train, for, california, the, veteran, stage, performer, was, by, then, nearly, 40, years, old, an, unusually, late, age, to, begin, a, film, career, especially, for, women, although, paramount, certainly, never, had, the, slightest, intention, of, casting, her, as, an, ing, nue, she, nonetheless, managed, to, keep, her, age, ambiguous, for, some, time, she, made, her, film, debut, in, the, role, of, maudie, triplett, in, night, after, night, 1932, starring, george, raft, who, had, suggested, west, for, the, part, she, did, not, like, her, small, supporting, role, in, the, drama, at, first, but, was, appeased, when, she, was, allowed, to, rewrite, portions, of, her, character, s, dialogue, one, of, several, revisions, she, made, is, in, her, first, scene, in, night, after, night, when, a, hat, check, girl, exclaims, goodness, what, beautiful, diamonds, and, west, replies, goodness, had, nothing, to, do, with, it, dearie, reflecting, on, the, overall, result, of, her, rewritten, scenes, raft, is, reported, to, have, said, she, stole, everything, but, the, cameras, for, her, next, role, for, paramount, west, brought, her, diamond, lil, character, now, renamed, lady,

the, only, film, for, which, west, was, virtually, not, allowed, to, write, her, own, dialogue, and, as, a, result, the, film, suffered, perhaps, the, most, critical, ongoing, challenge, facing, west, in, her, career, was, censorship, of, her, dialogue, as, on, broadway, a, decade, before, by, the, mid, 1930s, her, risqu, and, ribald, dialogue, could, no, longer, be, allowed, the, heat, s, on,

existed, regarding, the, reaction, to, the, skit, conservative, religious, groups, took, umbrage, far, more, swiftly, than, the, mainstream, these, groups, found, it, easy, to, make, west, their, target, they, took, exception, to, her, outspoken, use, of, sexuality, and, sexual, imagery, which, she, had, employed, in, her, career, since, at, least, the, pre, code, films, of, the, early, 1930s,
