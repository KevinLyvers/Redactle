a, career, of, over, 60, years, in, electronic, communications, over, the, next, 13, years, sarnoff, rose, from, office, boy, to, commercial, manager, of, the, company, learning, about, the, technology, and, the, business, of, electronic, communications, on, the, job, and, in, libraries, he, also, served, at, marconi, stations, on, ships, and, posts, on, siasconset, nantucket, and, the,

to, relay, the, first, remote, medical, diagnosis, from, the, ship, s, doctor, to, a, radio, operator, at, belle, isle, with, an, infected, tooth, the, following, year, he, led, two, other, operators, at, the, wanamaker, station, in, an, effort, to, confirm, the, fate, of, the, titanic, sarnoff, later, exaggerated, his, role, as, the, sole, hero, who, stayed, by, his, telegraph, key, for, three, days, to, receive, information, on, the, titanic, s, survivors, schwartz, questions, whether, sarnoff, who, was, a, manager, of, the, telegraphers, by, the, time, of, the, disaster, was, working, the, key, although, that, brushes, aside, concerns, about, corporate, hierarchy, the, event, began, on, a, sunday, when, the, store, would, have, been, closed, over, the, next, two, years, sarnoff, earned, promotions, to, chief, inspector, and, contracts, manager, for, a, company, whose, revenues, swelled, after, congress, passed, legislation, mandating, continuous, staffing, of, commercial, shipboard, radio, stations, that, same, year, marconi, won, a, patent, suit, that, gave, it, the, coastal, stations, of, the, united, wireless, telegraph, company, sarnoff, also, demonstrated, the, first, use, of, radio, on, a, railroad, line, the, lackawanna, railroad, company, s, link, between, binghamton, new, york, and, scranton, pennsylvania, and, permitted, and, observed, edwin, armstrong, s,

music, from, the, new, york, wanamaker, station, this, demonstration, and, the, at, t, demonstrations, in, 1915, of, long, distance, wireless, telephony, inspired, the, first, of, many, memos, to, his, superiors, on, applications, of, current, and, future, radio, technologies, sometime, late, in, 1915, or, in, 1916, he, proposed, to, the, company, s, president, edward, j, nally, that, the, company, develop, a, radio, music, box, for, the, amateur, market, of, radio, enthusiasts, nally, deferred, on, the, proposal, because, of, the, expanded, volume, of, business, during, world, war, i, throughout, the, war, years, sarnoff, remained, marconi, s, commercial, manager, including, oversight, of, the, company, s, factory, in, roselle, park, new, jersey, unlike, many, who, were, involved, with, early, radio, communications, who, often, viewed, radio, as, point, to, point, sarnoff, saw, the, potential, of, radio, as, point, to, mass, one, person, the, broadcaster, could, speak, to, many, the, listeners, when, owen, d, young, of, general, electric, arranged, the, purchase, of, american, marconi, and, reorganized, it, as, the, radio, corporation, of, america, a, radio, patent, monopoly, sarnoff, realized, his, dream, and, revived, his, proposal, in, a, lengthy, memo, on, the, company, s, business, and, prospects, his, superiors, again, ignored, him, but, he, contributed, to, the, rising, postwar, radio, boom, by, helping, arrange, for, the, broadcast, of, a, heavyweight, boxing, match, between, jack, dempsey, and, georges, carpentier, in, july, 1921, up, to, 300, 000, people, listened, to, the, broadcast, of, the, fight, and, demand, for, home, radio, equipment, bloomed, that, winter, by, the, spring, of, 1922, sarnoff, s, prediction, of, popular, demand, for, radio, broadcasting, had, come, to, pass, and, over, the, next, few, years, he, gained, much, stature, and, influence, in, 1925, rca, purchased, its, first, radio, station, weaf, new, york, and, launched, the, national, broadcasting, company, nbc, the, first, radio, network, in, america, four, years, later, sarnoff, became, president, of, rca, nbc, had, by, that, time, split, into, two, networks, the, red, and, the, blue, the, blue, network, eventually, became, abc, radio, sarnoff, is, often, inaccurately, referred, to, as, the, founder, of, both, rca, and, nbc, but, he, was, in, fact, founder, of, only, nbc, sarnoff, was, instrumental, in, building, and, establishing, the, am, broadcasting, radio, business, that, became, the, preeminent, public, radio, standard, for, the, majority, of, the, 20th, century, sarnoff, negotiated, successful, contracts, to, form, radio, keith, orpheum, rko, a, film, production, and, distribution, company, essential, elements, in, that, new, company, were, rca, the, film, booking, offices, of, america, fbo, and, the, keith, albee, orpheum, kao, theater, chain, when, sarnoff, was, put, in, charge, of, radio, broadcasting, at, rca, he, soon, recognized, the, potential, for, television, i, e, the, combination, of, motion, pictures, with, electronic, transmission, schemes, for, television, had, long, been, proposed, well, before, world, war, i, but, with, no, practical, outcome, sarnoff, was, determined, to, lead, his, company, in, pioneering, the, medium, and, met, with, westinghouse, engineer, vladimir, zworykin, in, 1928, at, the, time, zworykin, was, attempting, to, develop, an, all, electronic, television, system, at, westinghouse, but, with, little, success, zworykin, had, visited, the, laboratory, of, the, inventor, philo, t, farnsworth, who, had, developed, an, image, dissector, part, of, a, system, that, could, enable, a, working, television, zworykin, was, sufficiently, impressed, with, farnsworth, s, invention, that, he, had, his, team, at, westinghouse, make, several, copies, of, the, device, for, experimentation, zworykin, pitched, the, concept, to, sarnoff, claiming, a, viable, television, system, could, be, realized, in, two, years, with, a, mere, 100, 000, investment, sarnoff, opted, to, fund, zworkyin, s, research, most, likely, well, aware, that, zworykin, was, underestimating, the, scope, of, his, television, effort, seven, years, later, in, late, 1935, zworykin, s, photograph, appeared, on, the, cover, of, the, trade, journal, electronics, holding, an, early, rca, photomultiplier, prototype, the, photomultiplier, subject, of, intensive, research, at, rca, and, in, leningrad, russia, would, become, an, essential, component, within, sensitive, television, cameras, on, april, 24, 1936, rca, demonstrated, to, the, press, a, working, iconoscope, camera, tube, and, kinescope, receiver, display, tube, an, early, cathode, ray, tube, two, key, components, of, all, electronic, television, the, final, cost, of, the, enterprise, was, closer, to, 50, million, on, the, road, to, success, they, encountered, a, legal, battle, with, farnsworth, who, had, been, granted, patents, in, 1930, for, his, solution, to, broadcasting, moving, pictures, despite, sarnoff, s, efforts, to, prove, that, he, was, the, inventor, of, the, television, he, was, ordered, to, pay, farnsworth, 1, 000, 000, in, royalties, a, small, price, to, settle, the, dispute, for, an, invention, that, would, profoundly, revolutionize, the, world, however, this, sum, was, never, paid, to, farnsworth, in, 1929, sarnoff, engineered, the, purchase, of, the, victor, talking, machine, company, the, nation, s, largest, manufacturer, of, records, and, phonographs, merging, radio, phonograph, production, at, victor, s, large, manufacturing, facility, in, camden, new, jersey, sarnoff, became, president, of, rca, on, january, 3, 1930, succeeding, general, james, harbord, on, may, 30, the, company, was, involved, in, an, antitrust, case, concerning, the, original, radio, patent, pool, sarnoff, negotiated, an, outcome, where, rca, was, no, longer, partly, owned, by, westinghouse, and, general, electric, giving, him, final, say, in, the, company, s, affairs, initially, the, great, depression, caused, rca, to, cut, costs, but, zworykin, s, project, was, protected, after, nine, years, of, zworykin, s, hard, work, sarnoff, s, determination, and, legal, battles, with, farnsworth, in, which, farnsworth, was, proved, in, the, right, they, had, a, commercial, system, ready, to, launch, finally, in, april, 1939, regularly, scheduled, electronic, television, in, america, was, initiated, by, rca, under, the, name, of, their, broadcasting, division, at, the, time, the, national, broadcasting, company, nbc, the, first, television, broadcast, aired, was, the, dedication, of, the, rca, pavilion, at, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fairgrounds, and, was, introduced, by, sarnoff, himself, later, that, month, on, april, 30, opening, day, ceremonies, at, the, world, s, fair, were, telecast, in, the, medium, s, first, major, production, featuring, a, speech, by, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, first, us, president, to, appear, on, television, these, telecasts, were, seen, only, in, new, york, city, and, the, immediate, vicinity, since, nbc, television, had, only, one, station, at, the, time, w2xbs, channel, 1, now, wnbc, channel, 4, the, broadcast, was, seen, by, an, estimated, 1, 000, viewers, from, the, roughly, 200, television, sets, which, existed, in, the, new, york, city, area, at, the, time, the, standard, approved, by, the, national, television, system, committee, the, ntsc, in, 1941, differed, from, rca, s, standard, but, rca, quickly, became, the, market, leader, of, manufactured, sets, and, nbc, became, the, first, television, network, in, the, united, states, connecting, their, new, york, city, station, to, stations, in, philadelphia, and, schenectady, for, occasional, programs, in, the, early, 1940s, meanwhile, a, system, developed, by, emi, based, on, russian, research, and, zworykin, s, work, was, adopted, in, britain, and, the, bbc, had, a, regular, television, service, from, 1936, onwards, however, world, war, ii, put, a, halt, to, a, dynamic, growth, of, the, early, television, development, stages, at, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, sarnoff, served, on, eisenhower, s, communications, staff, arranging, expanded, radio, circuits, for, nbc, to, transmit, news, from, the, invasion, of, france, in, june, 1944, in, france, sarnoff, arranged, for, the, restoration, of, the, radio, france, station, in, paris, that, the, germans, destroyed, and, oversaw, the, construction, of, a, radio, transmitter, powerful, enough, to, reach, all, of, the, allied, forces, in, europe, called, radio, free, europe, in, recognition, of, his, achievements, sarnoff, was, decorated, with, the, legion, of, merit, on, october, 11, 1944, thanks, to, his, communications, skills, and, support, he, received, the, brigadier, general, s, star, in, december, 1945, and, thereafter, was, known, as, general, sarnoff, the, star, which, he, proudly, and, frequently, wore, was, buried, with, him, sarnoff, anticipated, that, post, war, america, would, need, an, international, radio, voice, explaining, its, policies, and, positions, in, 1943, he, tried, to, influence, secretary, of, state, cordell, hull, to, include, radio, broadcasting, in, post, war, planning, in, 1947, he, lobbied, secretary, of, state, george, marshall, to, expand, the, roles, of, radio, free, europe, and, voice, of, america, his, concerns, and, proposed, solutions, were, eventually, seen, as, prescient, after, the, war, monochrome, tv, production, began, in, earnest, color, tv, was, the, next, major, development, and, nbc, once, again, won, the, battle, cbs, had, their, electro, mechanical, color, television, system, approved, by, the, fcc, on, october, 10, 1950, but, sarnoff, filed, an, unsuccessful, suit, in, the, united, states, district, court, to, suspend, that, ruling, subsequently, he, made, an, appeal, to, the, supreme, court, which, eventually, upheld, the, fcc, decision, sarnoff, s, tenacity, and, determination, to, win, the, color, war, pushed, his, engineers, to, perfect, an, all, electronic, color, television, system, that, used, a, signal, that, could, be, received, on, existing, monochrome, sets, that, prevailed, cbs, was, now, unable, to, take, advantage, of, the, color, market, due, to, lack, of, manufacturing, capability, and, color, programming, a, system, that, could, not, be, seen, on, the, millions, of, black, and, white, receivers, and, sets, that, were, triple, the, cost, of, monochrome, sets, a, few, days, after, cbs, had, its, color, premiere, on, june, 14, 1951, rca, demonstrated, a, fully, functional, all, electronic, color, tv, system, and, became, the, leading, manufacturer, of, color, tv, sets, in, the, us, cbs, system, color, tv, production, was, suspended, in, october, 1951, for, the, duration, of, the, korean, war, as, more, people, bought, monochrome, sets, it, was, increasingly, unlikely, that, cbs, could, achieve, any, success, with, its, incompatible, system, few, receivers, were, sold, and, there, were, almost, no, color, broadcasts, especially, in, prime, time, when, cbs, could, not, run, the, risk, of, broadcasting, a, program, which, few, could, see, the, ntsc, was, reformed, and, recommended, a, system, virtually, identical, to, rca, s, in, august, 1952, on, december, 17, 1953, the, fcc, approved, rca, s, system, as, the, new, standard, in, 1955, sarnoff, received, the, hundred, year, association, of, new, york, s, gold,

foreign, policy, as, a, member, of, that, panel, and, in, a, subsequent, essay, published, in, life, as, part, of, its, the, national, purpose, series, he, was, critical, of, the, tentative, stand, being, taken, by, the, united, states, in, fighting, the, political, and, psychological, warfare, being, waged, by, soviet, led, international, communism, against, the, west, he, strongly, advocated, an, aggressive, multi, faceted, fight, in, the, ideological, and, political, realms, with, a, determination, to, decisively, win, the, cold, war, sarnoff, retired, in, 1970, at, the, age, of, 79, and,
