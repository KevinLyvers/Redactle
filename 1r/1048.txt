solon, greek, c, 630, c, 560, bc, was, an, archaic, athenian, statesman, lawmaker, political, philosopher, and, poet, he, is, one, of, the, seven, sages, of, greece, and, credited, with, laying, the, foundations, for, athenian, democracy, solon, s, efforts, to, legislate, against, political, economic, and, moral, decline, resulted, in, his, constitutional, reform, overturning, most, of, draco, s, laws, solon, s, reforms, included, debt, relief, later, known, and, celebrated, among, athenians, as, the, seisachtheia, shaking, off, of, burdens, he, is, described, by, aristotle, in, the, athenian, constitution, as, the, first, people, s, champion, demosthenes, credited, solon, s, reforms, with, starting, a, golden, age, modern, knowledge, of, solon, is, limited, by, the, fact, that, his, works, only, survive, in, fragments, and, appear, to, feature, interpolations, by, later, authors, it, is, further, limited, by, the, general, paucity, of, documentary, and, archaeological, evidence, covering, athens, in, the, early, 6th, century, bc, ancient, authors, such, as, philo, of, alexandria, herodotus, and, plutarch, are, the, main, sources, but, wrote, about, solon, long, after, his, death, fourth, century, bc, orators, such, as, aeschines, tended, to, attribute, to, solon, all, the, laws, of, their, own, much, later, times, solon, was, born, in, athens, around, 630, bc, his, family, was, distinguished, in, attica, as, they, belonged, to, a, noble, or, eupatrid, clan, solon, s, father, was, probably, execestides, if, so, his, lineage, could, be, traced, back, to, codrus, the, last, king, of, athens, according, to, diogenes, la, rtius, he, had, a, brother, named, dropides, who, was, an, ancestor, six, generations, removed, of, plato, according, to, plutarch, solon, was, related, to, the, tyrant, pisistratus, for, their, mothers, were, cousins, solon, was, eventually, drawn, into, the, unaristocratic, pursuit, of, commerce, when, athens, and, its, neighbor, and, rival, in, the, saronic, gulf, megara, were, contesting, the, possession, of, salamis, solon, was, made, leader, of, the, athenian, forces, after, repeated, disasters, solon, was, able, to, improve, the, morale, of, his, troops, through, a, nationalist, poem, he, wrote, about, the, island, supported, by, pisistratus, he, defeated, the, megarians, either, by, means, of, a, cunning, trick, or, more, directly, through, heroic, battle, around, 595, bc, the, megarians, however, refused, to, give, up, their, claim, the, dispute, was, referred, to, the, spartans, who, eventually, awarded, possession, of, the, island, to, athens, on, the, strength, of, the, case, that, solon, put, to, them, plutarch, professes, admiration, of, solon, s, elegy, the, same, poem, was, said, by, diogenes, la, rtius, to, have, stirred, athenians, more, than, any, other, verses, that, solon, wrote, let, us, go, to, salamis, to, fight, for, the, island, we, desire, and, drive, away, from, our, bitter, shame, one, fragment, describes, assorted, breads, and, cakes, they, drink, and, some, nibble, honey, and, sesame, cakes, itria, others, their, bread, other, gouroi, mixed, with, lentils, in, that, place, not, one, cake, was, unavailable, of, all, those, that, the, black, earth, bears, for, human, beings, and, all, were, present, unstintingly, according, to, diogenes, laertius, in, 594, bc, solon, was, chosen, archon, or, chief, magistrate, solon, repealed, all, of, draco, s, laws, except, those, relating, to, homicide, during, solon, s, time, many, greek, city, states, had, seen, the, emergence, of, tyrants, opportunistic, noblemen, who, had, taken, power, on, behalf, of, sectional, interests, solon, was, described, by, plutarch, as, having, been, temporarily, awarded, autocratic, powers, by, athenian, citizens, on, the, grounds, that, he, had, the, wisdom, to, sort, out, their, differences, for, them, in, a, peaceful, and, equitable, manner, some, modern, scholars, believe, these, powers, were, in, fact, granted, some, years, after, solon, had, been, archon, when, he, would, have, been, a, member, of, the, areopagus, and, probably, a, more, respected, statesman, by, his, peers, as, archon, solon, discussed, his, intended, reforms, with, some, friends, knowing, that, he, was, about, to, cancel, all, debts, these, friends, took, out, loans, and, promptly, bought, some, land, suspected, of, complicity, solon, complied, with, his, own, law, and, released, his, own, debtors, amounting, to, five, talents, or, 15, according, to, some, sources, his, friends, never, repaid, their, debts, after, completing, his, work, of, reform, solon, surrendered, his, extraordinary, authority, and, traveled, abroad, for, ten, years, so, that, the, athenians, could, not, induce, him, to, repeal, any, of, his, laws, within, four, years, of, solon, s, departure, the, old, social, rifts, re, appeared, but, with, some, new, complications, there, were, irregularities, in, the, new, governmental, procedures, elected, officials, sometimes, refused, to, stand, down, from, their, posts, and, occasionally, important, posts, were, left, vacant, it, has, even, been, said, that, some, people, blamed, solon, for, their, troubles, eventually, one, of, solon, s, relatives, pisistratus, ended, the, factionalism, by, force, thus, instituting, an, unconstitutionally, gained, tyranny, in, plutarch, s, account, solon, accused, athenians, of, stupidity, and, cowardice, for, allowing, this, to, happen, solon, s, first, stop, in, his, travels, was, egypt, there, according, to, herodotus, he, visited, the, pharaoh, of, egypt, amasis, ii, according, to, plutarch, he, spent, some, time, and, discussed, philosophy, with, two, egyptian, priests, psenophis, of, heliopolis, and, sonchis, of, sais, a, character, in, two, of, plato, s, dialogues, timaeus, and, critias, claims, solon, visited, neith, s, temple, at, sais, and, received, from, the, priests, there, an, account, of, the, history, of, atlantis, next, solon, sailed, to, cyprus, where, he, oversaw, the, construction, of, a, new, capital, for, a, local, king, in, gratitude, for, which, the, king, named, it, soloi, solon, s, travels, finally, brought, him, to, sardis, capital, of, lydia, according, to, herodotus, and, plutarch, he, met, with, croesus, and, gave, the, lydian, king, advice, which, croesus, failed, to, appreciate, until, it, was, too, late, croesus, had, considered, himself, to, be, the, happiest, man, alive, and, solon, had, advised, him, count, no, man, happy, until, he, be, dead, the, reasoning, was, that, at, any, minute, fortune, might, turn, on, even, the, happiest, man, and, make, his, life, miserable, it, was, only, after, he, had, lost, his, kingdom, to, the, persian, king, cyrus, while, awaiting, execution, that, croesus, acknowledged, the, wisdom, of, solon, s, advice, after, his, return, to, athens, solon, became, a, staunch, opponent, of, pisistratus, in, protest, and, as, an, example, to, others, solon, stood, outside, his, own, home, in, full, armour, urging, all, who, passed, to, resist, the, machinations, of, the, would, be, tyrant, his, efforts, were, in, vain, solon, died, shortly, after, pisistratus, usurped, by, force, the, autocratic, power, that, athens, had, once, freely, bestowed, upon, him, solon, died, in, cyprus, at, the, age, of, 80, and, in, accordance, with, his, will, his, ashes, were, scattered, around, salamis, the, island, where, he, was, born, pausanias, listed, solon, among, the, seven, sages, whose, aphorisms, adorned, apollo, s, temple, in, delphi, stobaeus, in, the, florilegium, relates, a, story, about, a, symposium, where, solon, s, young, nephew, was, singing, a, poem, of, sappho, s, solon, upon, hearing, the, song, asked, the, boy, to, teach, him, to, sing, it, when, someone, asked, why, should, you, waste, your, time, on, it, solon, replied, so, that, i, may, learn, it, before, i, die, ammianus, marcellinus, however, told, a, similar, story, about, socrates, and, the, poet, stesichorus, quoting, the, philosopher, s, rapture, in, almost, identical, terms, ut, aliquid, sciens, amplius, e, vita, discedam, meaning, in, order, to, leave, life, knowing, a, little, more, the, social, and, political, upheavals, that, characterized, athens, in, solon, s, time, have, been, variously, interpreted, by, historians, from, ancient, times, to, the, present, day, the, historical, account, of, solon, s, athens, has, evolved, over, many, centuries, into, a, set, of, contradictory, stories, or, a, complex, story, that, might, be, interpreted, in, a, variety, of, ways, as, further, evidence, accumulates, and, as, historians, continue, to, debate, the, issues, solon, s, motivations, and, the, intentions, behind, his, reforms, will, continue, to, attract, speculation, two, contemporary, historians, have, identified, three, distinct, historical, accounts, of, solon, s, athens, emphasizing, quite, different, rivalries, economic, and, or, ideological, rivalry, regional, rivalry, and, rivalry, between, aristocratic, clans, these, different, accounts, provide, a, convenient, basis, for, an, overview, of, the, issues, involved, economic, and, ideological, rivalry, is, a, common, theme, in, ancient, sources, this, sort, of, account, emerges, from, solon, s, poems, in, which, he, casts, himself, in, the, role, of, a, noble, mediator, between, two, intemperate, and, unruly, factions, this, same, account, is, substantially, taken, up, about, three, centuries, later, by, the, author, of, the, aristotelian, athenaion, politeia, but, with, an, interesting, variation, there, was, conflict, between, the, nobles, and, the, common, people, for, an, extended, period, for, the, constitution, they, were, under, was, oligarchic, in, every, respect, and, especially, in, that, the, poor, along, with, their, wives, and, children, were, in, slavery, to, the, rich, all, the, land, was, in, the, hands, of, a, few, and, if, men, did, not, pay, their, rents, they, themselves, and, their, children, were, liable, to, be, seized, as, slaves, the, security, for, all, loans, was, the, debtor, s, prison, up, to, the, time, of, solon, he, was, the, first, people, s, champion, here, solon, is, presented, as, a, partisan, in, a, democratic, cause, whereas, judged, from, the, viewpoint, of, his, own, poems, he, was, instead, a, mediator, between, rival, factions, a, still, more, significant, variation, in, the, ancient, historical, account, appears, in, the, writing, of, plutarch, in, the, late, 1st, early, 2nd, century, ad, athens, was, torn, by, recurrent, conflict, about, the, constitution, the, city, was, divided, into, as, many, parties, as, there, were, geographical, divisions, in, its, territory, for, the, party, of, the, people, of, the, hills, was, most, in, favour, of, democracy, that, of, the, people, of, the, plain, was, most, in, favour, of, oligarchy, while, the, third, group, the, people, of, the, coast, which, preferred, a, mixed, form, of, constitution, somewhat, between, the, other, two, formed, an, obstruction, and, prevented, the, other, groups, from, gaining, control, regional, rivalry, is, a, theme, commonly, found, among, modern, scholars, the, new, picture, which, emerged, was, one, of, strife, between, regional, groups, united, by, local, loyalties, and, led, by, wealthy, landowners, their, goal, was, to, take, control, of, the, central, government, at, athens, and, with, it, dominate, over, their, rivals, from, other, districts, of, attica, regional, factionalism, was, inevitable, in, a, relatively, large, territory, such, as, athens, possessed, in, most, greek, city, states, a, farmer, could, conveniently, reside, in, a, town, and, travel, to, and, from, his, fields, every, day, according, to, thucydides, on, the, other, hand, most, athenians, continued, to, live, in, rural, settlements, right, up, until, the, peloponnesian, war, the, effects, of, regionalism, in, a, large, territory, could, be, seen, in, laconia, where, sparta, had, gained, control, through, intimidation, and, resettlement, of, some, of, its, neighbours, and, enslavement, of, the, rest, attika, in, solon, s, time, seemed, to, be, moving, towards, a, similarly, ugly, solution, with, many, citizens, in, danger, of, being, reduced, to, the, status, of, helots, rivalry, between, clans, is, a, theme, recently, developed, by, some, scholars, based, on, an, appreciation, of, the, political, significance, of, kinship, groupings, according, to, this, account, bonds, of, kinship, rather, than, local, loyalties, were, the, decisive, influence, on, events, in, archaic, athens, an, athenian, belonged, not, only, to, a, phyle, or, tribe, and, one, of, its, subdivisions, the, phratry, or, brotherhood, but, also, to, an, extended, family, clan, or, genos, it, has, been, argued, that, these, interconnecting, units, of, kinship, reinforced, a, hierarchic, structure, with, aristocratic, clans, at, the, top, thus, rivalries, between, aristocratic, clans, could, engage, all, levels, of, society, irrespective, of, any, regional, ties, in, that, case, the, struggle, between, rich, and, poor, was, the, struggle, between, powerful, aristocrats, and, the, weaker, affiliates, of, their, rivals, or, perhaps, even, with, their, own, rebellious, affiliates, solon, s, laws, were, inscribed, on, axones, large, wooden, slabs, or, cylinders, attached, to, a, series, of, axles, that, stood, upright, in, the, prytaneion, originally, the, axones, recorded, laws, enacted, by, draco, in, the, late, 7th, century, traditionally, 621, bc, nothing, of, draco, s, codification, has, survived, except, for, a, law, relating, to, homicide, yet, there, is, consensus, among, scholars, that, it, did, not, amount, to, anything, like, a, constitution, during, his, visit, to, athens, pausanias, the, 2nd, century, ad, geographer, reported, that, the, inscribed, laws, of, solon, were, still, displayed, by, the, prytaneion, fragments, of, the, axones, were, still, visible, in, plutarch, s, time, but, today, the, only, records, we, have, of, solon, s, laws, are, fragmentary, quotes, and, comments, in, literary, sources, such, as, those, written, by, plutarch, himself, moreover, the, language, of, his, laws, was, archaic, even, by, the, standards, of, the, fifth, century, and, this, caused, interpretation, problems, for, ancient, commentators, modern, scholars, doubt, the, reliability, of, these, sources, and, our, knowledge, of, solon, s, legislation, is, therefore, actually, very, limited, in, its, details, generally, solon, s, reforms, appear, to, have, been, constitutional, economic, moral, and, sexual, in, their, scope, this, distinction, though, somewhat, artificial, does, at, least, provide, a, convenient, framework, within, which, to, consider, the, laws, that, have, been, attributed, to, solon, some, short, term, consequences, of, his, reforms, are, considered, at, the, end, of, the, section, depending, on, how, we, interpret, the, historical, facts, known, to, us, solon, s, constitutional, reforms, were, either, a, radical, anticipation, of, democratic, government, or, they, merely, provided, a, plutocratic, flavour, to, a, stubbornly, aristocratic, regime, or, else, the, truth, lies, somewhere, between, these, two, extremes, before, solon, s, reforms, the, athenian, state, was, administered, by, nine, archons, appointed, or, elected, annually, by, the, areopagus, on, the, basis, of, noble, birth, and, wealth, there, was, an, assembly, of, athenian, citizens, the, ekklesia, but, the, lowest, class, the, thetes, was, not, admitted, and, its, deliberative, procedures, were, controlled, by, the, nobles, there, therefore, seemed, to, be, no, means, by, which, an, archon, could, be, called, to, account, for, breach, of, oath, unless, the, areopagus, favoured, his, prosecution, according, to, the, athenian, constitution, solon, legislated, for, all, citizens, to, be, admitted, into, the, ekklesia, and, for, a, court, the, heliaia, to, be, formed, from, all, the, citizens, the, heliaia, appears, to, have, been, the, ekklesia, or, some, representative, portion, of, it, sitting, as, a, jury, by, giving, common, people, the, power, not, only, to, elect, officials, but, also, to, call, them, to, account, solon, appears, to, have, established, the, foundations, of, a, true, republic, there, is, consensus, among, scholars, that, solon, lowered, the, requirements, those, that, existed, in, terms, of, financial, and, social, qualifications, which, applied, to, election, to, public, office, the, solonian, constitution, divided, citizens, into, four, political, classes, defined, according, to, assessable, property, a, classification, that, might, previously, have, served, the, state, for, military, or, taxation, purposes, only, the, standard, unit, for, this, assessment, was, one, medimnos, approximately, 12, gallons, of, cereals, and, yet, the, kind, of, classification, set, out, below, might, be, considered, too, simplistic, to, be, historically, accurate, according, to, the, athenian, constitution, only, the, pentakosiomedimnoi, were, eligible, for, election, to, high, office, as, archons, and, therefore, only, they, gained, admission, into, the, areopagus, a, modern, view, affords, the, same, privilege, to, the, hippeis, the, top, three, classes, were, eligible, for, a, variety, of, lesser, posts, and, only, the, thetes, were, excluded, from, all, public, office, the, real, motives, behind, solon, s, economic, reforms, are, as, questionable, as, his, real, motives, for, constitutional, reform, were, the, poor, being, forced, to, serve, the, needs, of, a, changing, economy, was, the, economy, being, reformed, to, serve, the, needs, of, the, poor, or, were, solon, s, policies, the, manifestation, of, a, struggle, taking, place, between, poorer, citizens, and, the, aristocrats, solon, s, economic, reforms, need, to, be, understood, in, the, context, of, the, primitive, subsistence, economy, that, prevailed, both, before, and, after, his, time, most, athenians, were, still, living, in, rural, settlements, right, up, to, the, peloponnesian, war, opportunities, for, trade, even, within, the, athenian, borders, were, limited, the, typical, farming, family, even, in, classical, times, barely, produced, enough, to, satisfy, its, own, needs, opportunities, for, international, trade, were, minimal, it, has, been, estimated, that, even, in, roman, times, goods, rose, 40, in, value, for, every, 100, miles, they, were, carried, over, land, but, only, 1, 3, for, the, same, distance, were, they, carried, by, ship, and, yet, there, is, no, evidence, that, athens, possessed, any, merchant, ships, until, around, 525, bc, until, then, the, narrow, warship, doubled, as, a, cargo, vessel, athens, like, other, greek, city, states, in, the, 7th, century, bc, was, faced, with, increasing, population, pressures, and, by, about, 525, bc, it, was, able, to, feed, itself, only, in, good, years, solon, s, reforms, can, thus, be, seen, to, have, taken, place, at, a, crucial, period, of, economic, transition, when, a, subsistence, rural, economy, increasingly, required, the, support, of, a, nascent, commercial, sector, the, specific, economic, reforms, credited, to, solon, are, these, it, is, generally, assumed, on, the, authority, of, ancient, commentators, that, solon, also, reformed, the, athenian, coinage, however, recent, numismatic, studies, now, lead, to, the, conclusion, that, athens, probably, had, no, coinage, until, around, 560, bc, well, after, solon, s, reforms, nevertheless, there, are, now, reasons, to, suggest, that, monetization, had, already, begun, before, solon, s, reforms, by, early, sixth, century, the, athenians, were, using, silver, in, the, form, of, a, variety, of, bullion, silver, pieces, for, monetary, payments, drachma, and, obol, as, a, term, of, bullion, value, had, already, been, adopted, although, the, corresponding, standard, weights, were, probably, unstable, solon, s, economic, reforms, succeeded, in, stimulating, foreign, trade, athenian, black, figure, pottery, was, exported, in, increasing, quantities, and, good, quality, throughout, the, aegean, between, 600, bc, and, 560, bc, a, success, story, that, coincided, with, a, decline, in, trade, in, corinthian, pottery, the, ban, on, the, export, of, grain, might, be, understood, as, a, relief, measure, for, the, benefit, of, the, poor, however, the, encouragement, of, olive, production, for, export, could, actually, have, led, to, increased, hardship, for, many, athenians, to, the, extent, that, it, led, to, a, reduction, in, the, amount, of, land, dedicated, to, grain, moreover, an, olive, produces, no, fruit, for, the, first, six, years, but, farmers, difficulty, of, lasting, until, payback, may, also, give, rise, to, a, mercantilist, argument, in, favour, of, supporting, them, through, that, since, the, british, case, illustrates, that, one, domestic, policy, that, had, a, lasting, impact, was, the, conversion, of, waste, lands, to, agricultural, use, mercantilists, felt, that, to, maximize, a, nation, s, power, all, land, and, resources, had, to, be, used, to, their, utmost, in, his, poems, solon, portrays, athens, as, being, under, threat, from, the, unrestrained, greed, and, arrogance, of, its, citizens, even, the, earth, gaia, the, mighty, mother, of, the, gods, had, been, enslaved, the, visible, symbol, of, this, perversion, of, the, natural, and, social, order, was, a, boundary, marker, called, a, horos, a, wooden, or, stone, pillar, indicating, that, a, farmer, was, in, debt, or, under, contractual, obligation, to, someone, else, either, a, noble, patron, or, a, creditor, up, until, solon, s, time, land, was, the, inalienable, property, of, a, family, or, clan, and, it, could, not, be, sold, or, mortgaged, this, was, no, disadvantage, to, a, clan, with, large, landholdings, since, it, could, always, rent, out, farms, in, a, sharecropping, system, a, family, struggling, on, a, small, farm, however, could, not, use, the, farm, as, security, for, a, loan, even, if, it, owned, the, farm, instead, the, farmer, would, have, to, offer, himself, and, his, family, as, security, providing, some, form, of, slave, labour, in, lieu, of, repayment, equally, a, family, might, voluntarily, pledge, part, of, its, farm, income, or, labour, to, a, powerful, clan, in, return, for, its, protection, farmers, subject, to, these, sorts, of, arrangements, were, loosely, known, as, hektemoroi, indicating, that, they, either, paid, or, kept, a, sixth, of, a, farm, s, annual, yield, in, the, event, of, bankruptcy, or, failure, to, honour, the, contract, stipulated, by, the, horoi, farmers, and, their, families, could, in, fact, be, sold, into, slavery, solon, s, reform, of, these, injustices, was, later, known, and, celebrated, among, athenians, as, the, seisachtheia, shaking, off, of, burdens, as, with, all, his, reforms, there, is, considerable, scholarly, debate, about, its, real, significance, many, scholars, are, content, to, accept, the, account, given, by, the, ancient, sources, interpreting, it, as, a, cancellation, of, debts, while, others, interpret, it, as, the, abolition, of, a, type, of, feudal, relationship, and, some, prefer, to, explore, new, possibilities, for, interpretation, the, reforms, included, the, removal, of, the, horoi, clearly, provided, immediate, economic, relief, for, the, most, oppressed, group, in, attica, and, it, also, brought, an, immediate, end, to, the, enslavement, of, athenians, by, their, countrymen, some, athenians, had, already, been, sold, into, slavery, abroad, and, some, had, fled, abroad, to, escape, enslavement, solon, proudly, records, in, verse, the, return, of, this, diaspora, it, has, been, cynically, observed, however, that, few, of, these, unfortunates, were, likely, to, have, been, recovered, it, has, been, observed, also, that, the, seisachtheia, not, only, removed, slavery, and, accumulated, debt, but, may, also, have, removed, the, ordinary, farmer, s, only, means, of, obtaining, further, credit, the, seisachtheia, however, was, merely, one, set, of, reforms, within, a, broader, agenda, of, moral, reformation, other, reforms, included, demosthenes, claimed, that, the, city, s, subsequent, golden, age, included, personal, modesty, and, frugality, among, the, athenian, aristocracy, as, a, regulator, of, athenian, society, solon, according, to, some, authors, also, formalized, its, sexual, mores, according, to, a, surviving, fragment, from, a, work, brothers, by, the, comic, playwright, philemon, solon, established, publicly, funded, brothels, at, athens, in, order, to, democratize, the, availability, of, sexual, pleasure, while, the, veracity, of, this, comic, account, is, open, to, doubt, at, least, one, modern, author, considers, it, significant, that, in, classical, athens, three, hundred, or, so, years, after, the, death, of, solon, there, existed, a, discourse, that, associated, his, reforms, with, an, increased, availability, of, heterosexual, contacts, ancient, authors, also, say, that, solon, regulated, pederastic, relationships, in, athens, this, has, been, presented, as, an, adaptation, of, custom, to, the, new, structure, of, the, polis, according, to, various, authors, ancient, lawgivers, and, therefore, solon, by, implication, drew, up, a, set, of, laws, that, were, intended, to, promote, and, safeguard, the, institution, of, pederasty, and, to, control, abuses, against, freeborn, boys, in, particular, the, orator, aeschines, cites, laws, excluding, slaves, from, wrestling, halls, and, forbidding, them, to, enter, pederastic, relationships, with, the, sons, of, citizens, accounts, of, solon, s, laws, by, 4th, century, orators, like, aeschines, however, are, considered, unreliable, for, a, number, of, reasons, attic, pleaders, did, not, hesitate, to, attribute, to, him, solon, any, law, which, suited, their, case, and, later, writers, had, no, criterion, by, which, to, distinguish, earlier, from, later, works, nor, can, any, complete, and, authentic, collection, of, his, statutes, have, survived, for, ancient, scholars, to, consult, besides, the, alleged, legislative, aspect, of, solon, s, involvement, with, pederasty, there, were, also, suggestions, of, personal, involvement, ancient, readers, concluded, based, on, his, own, erotic, poetry, that, solon, himself, had, a, preference, for, boys, according, to, some, ancient, authors, solon, had, taken, the, future, tyrant, pisistratus, as, his, eromenos, aristotle, writing, around, 330, bc, attempted, to, refute, that, belief, claiming, that, those, are, manifestly, talking, nonsense, who, pretend, that, solon, was, the, lover, of, pisistratus, for, their, ages, do, not, admit, of, it, as, solon, was, about, thirty, years, older, than, pisistratus, nevertheless, the, tradition, persisted, four, centuries, later, plutarch, ignored, aristotle, s, skepticism, and, recorded, the, following, anecdote, supplemented, with, his, own, conjectures, and, they, say, solon, loved, and, that, is, the, reason, i, suppose, that, when, afterwards, they, differed, about, the, government, their, enmity, never, produced, any, hot, and, violent, passion, they, remembered, their, old, kindnesses, and, retained, still, in, its, embers, living, the, strong, fire, of, their, love, and, dear, affection, a, century, after, plutarch, aelian, also, said, that, pisistratus, had, been, solon, s, eromenos, despite, its, persistence, however, it, is, not, known, whether, the, account, is, historical, or, fabricated, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, tradition, presenting, a, peaceful, and, happy, coexistence, between, solon, and, pisistratus, was, cultivated, during, the, latter, s, dominion, in, order, to, legitimize, his, own, rule, as, well, as, that, of, his, sons, whatever, its, source, later, generations, lent, credence, to, the, narrative, solon, s, presumed, pederastic, desire, was, thought, in, antiquity, to, have, found, expression, also, in, his, poetry, which, is, today, represented, only, in, a, few, surviving, fragments, the, authenticity, of, all, the, poetic, fragments, attributed, to, solon, is, however, uncertain, in, particular, pederastic, aphorisms, ascribed, by, some, ancient, sources, to, solon, have, been, ascribed, by, other, sources, to, theognis, instead, it, is, recorded, that, solon, wrote, poetry, for, pleasure, as, patriotic, propaganda, and, in, defence, of, his, constitutional, reform, solon, s, verses, have, come, down, to, us, in, fragmentary, quotations, by, ancient, authors, such, as, plutarch, and, demosthenes, who, used, them, to, illustrate, their, own, arguments, it, is, possible, that, some, fragments, have, been, wrongly, attributed, to, him, and, some, scholars, have, detected, interpolations, by, later, authors, he, was, also, the, first, citizen, of, athens, to, reference, the, goddess, athena, fr, 4, 1, 4, the, literary, merit, of, solon, s, verse, is, generally, considered, unexceptional, solon, s, poetry, can, be, said, to, appear, self, righteous, and, pompous, at, times, and, he, once, composed, an, elegy, with, moral, advice, for, a, more, gifted, elegiac, poet, mimnermus, most, of, the, extant, verses, show, him, writing, in, the, role, of, a, political, activist, determined, to, assert, personal, authority, and, leadership, and, they, have, been, described, by, the, german, classicist, wilamowitz, as, a, versified, harangue, eine, volksrede, in, versen, according, to, plutarch, however, solon, originally, wrote, poetry, for, amusement, discussing, pleasure, in, a, popular, rather, than, philosophical, way, solon, s, elegiac, style, is, said, to, have, been, influenced, by, the, example, of, tyrtaeus, he, also, wrote, iambic, and, trochaic, verses, which, according, to, one, modern, scholar, are, more, lively, and, direct, than, his, elegies, and, possibly, paved, the, way, for, the, iambics, of, athenian, drama, solon, s, verses, are, mainly, significant, for, historical, rather, than, aesthetic, reasons, as, a, personal, record, of, his, reforms, and, attitudes, however, poetry, is, not, an, ideal, genre, for, communicating, facts, and, very, little, detailed, information, can, be, derived, from, the, surviving, fragments, according, to, solon, the, poet, solon, the, reformer, was, a, voice, for, political, moderation, in, athens, at, a, time, when, his, fellow, citizens, were, increasingly, polarized, by, social, and, economic, differences, some, wicked, men, are, rich, some, good, are, poor, we, will, not, change, our, virtue, for, their, store, virtue, s, a, thing, that, none, can, take, away, but, money, changes, owners, all, the, day, here, translated, by, the, english, poet, john, dryden, solon, s, words, define, a, moral, high, ground, where, differences, between, rich, and, poor, can, be, reconciled, or, maybe, just, ignored, his, poetry, indicates, that, he, attempted, to, use, his, extraordinary, legislative, powers, to, establish, a, peaceful, settlement, between, the, country, s, rival, factions, before, them, both, i, held, my, shield, of, might, and, let, not, either, touch, the, other, s, right, his, attempts, evidently, were, misunderstood, formerly, they, boasted, of, me, vainly, with, averted, eyes, now, they, look, askance, upon, me, friends, no, more, but, enemies, examining, the, poetry, composed, by, solon, makes, it, evident, that, he, adhered, to, a, deontological, ethical, theory, that, acknowledges, certain, acts, to, be, intrinsically, wrong, no, matter, what, even, if, the, resulting, consequences, are, considered, good, when, solon, released, athenians, from, debt, he, did, so, because, he, believed, this, to, be, inherently, good, despite, the, consequences, being, negative, for, him, in, one, of, his, surviving, poems, solon, writes, about, the, importance, of, lawfulness, and, its, ability, to, straighten, out, distorted, judgements, and, make, all, men, s, affairs, correct, and, rational, his, passion, for, lawfulness, and, his, belief, that, following, the, law, is, what, straightens, out, judgment, both, imply, that, he, believes, that, the, set, of, rules, established, by, the, city, state, of, athens, are, objectively, moral, no, matter, what, consequences, may, come, about, in, another, of, his, surviving, poems, solon, writes, such, is, the, punishment, of, zeus, he, does, not, flare, at, every, insult, like, a, mortal, man, but, all, the, time, he, is, aware, whose, heart, is, marked, with, sin, and, in, the, end, it, shows, for, sure, solon, makes, it, clear, in, this, excerpt, that, even, if, somebody, commits, an, immoral, act, and, doesn, t, receive, any, negative, consequences, he, believes, they, will, inevitably, pay, the, price, in, the, end, this, reinforces, his, deontological, ideology, in, which, he, believes, that, certain, actions, are, wrong, and, should, be, avoided, even, if, negative, consequences, are, not, suffered, in, their, own, lifetime
