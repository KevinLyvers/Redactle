sir, william, rowan, hamilton, fras, 3, 4, august, 1805, 2, september, 1865, was, an, irish, mathematician, astronomer, and, physicist, he, was, andrews, professor, of, astronomy, at, trinity, college, dublin, hamilton, was, dunsink, s, third, director, having, worked, there, from, 1827, to, 1865, his, career, included, the, study, of, geometrical, optics, fourier, analysis, and, quaternions, the, last, of, which, made, him, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, linear, algebra, he, has, made, major, contributions, in, optics, classical, mechanics, and, abstract, algebra, his, work, is, fundamental, to, modern, theoretical, physics, particularly, his, reformulation, of, newtonian, mechanics, hamiltonian, mechanics, including, its, hamilitonian, function, are, now, central, both, to, electromagnetism, and, quantum, mechanics, hamilton, was, the, fourth, of, nine, children, born, to, sarah, hutton, 1780, 1817, and, archibald, hamilton, 1778, 1819, who, lived, in, dublin, at, 29, dominick, street, later, renumbered, to, 36, hamilton, s, father, who, was, from, dublin, worked, as, a, solicitor, by, the, age, of, three, hamilton, had, been, sent, to, live, with, his, uncle, james, hamilton, a, graduate, of, trinity, college, who, ran, a, school, in, talbots, castle, in, trim, county, meath, hamilton, is, said, to, have, shown, talent, at, an, early, age, his, uncle, observed, that, hamilton, from, a, young, age, had, displayed, an, uncanny, ability, to, acquire, languages, a, claim, which, has, been, disputed, by, some, historians, who, claim, he, had, only, a, basic, understanding, of, them, 207, at, the, age, of, seven, he, had, already, made, progress, in, hebrew, and, before, he, was, 13, he, had, acquired, under, the, care, of, his, uncle, a, dozen, languages, classical, and, modern, european, languages, persian, arabic, hindustani, sanskrit, marathi, and, malay, the, emphasis, of, hamilton, s, early, education, on, languages, is, attributed, to, the, wish, of, his, father, to, see, him, employed, by, the, british, east, india, company, an, expert, mental, calculator, the, young, hamilton, was, capable, of, working, out, some, calculations, to, many, decimal, places, in, september, 1813, the, american, calculating, prodigy, zerah, colburn, was, being, exhibited, in, dublin, colburn, was, 9, a, year, older, than, hamilton, the, two, were, pitted, against, each, other, in, a, mental, arithmetic, contest, with, colburn, emerging, as, the, clear, victor, 208, in, reaction, to, his, defeat, hamilton, spent, less, time, studying, languages, and, more, on, mathematics, at, age, ten, he, stumbled, across, a, latin, copy, of, euclid, and, at, twelve, he, studied, newton, s, arithmetica, universalis, by, age, 16, he, had, covered, much, of, the, principia, as, well, as, some, more, recent, works, on, analytic, geometry, and, differential, calculus, in, mid, 1822, hamilton, began, a, systematic, study, of, laplace, s, m, canique, c, leste, during, this, period, he, encountered, what, he, believed, to, be, a, logical, error, in, m, canique, c, leste, an, observation, which, led, hamilton, to, be, introduced, to, john, brinkley, then, royal, astronomer, of, ireland, in, november, and, december, of, 1822, he, completed, his, first, three, original, mathematical, papers, on, his, first, visit, to, dunsink, observatory, he, showed, two, of, them, to, brinkley, who, requested, that, the, papers, be, developed, further, hamilton, complied, and, early, in, 1823, brinkley, approved, the, amended, version, in, july, of, 1823, hamilton, earned, a, place, at, trinity, college, dublin, by, examination, at, age, 17, his, tutor, there, was, charles, boyton, a, family, friend, who, brought, to, his, attention, the, contemporary, mathematics, published, by, the, group, at, the, cole, polytechnique, in, paris, john, brinkley, remarked, of, the, precocious, hamilton, this, young, man, i, do, not, say, will, be, but, is, the, first, mathematician, of, his, age, the, college, awarded, hamilton, two, optime, s, or, off, the, chart, grades, in, greek, and, in, physics, he, was, first, in, every, subject, and, at, every, examination, he, aimed, to, win, a, trinity, college, fellowship, by, competitive, examination, but, this, did, not, happen, instead, after, brinkley, in, 1826, was, made, bishop, of, cloyne, hamilton, was, appointed, in, 1827, to, the, vacant, posts, left, by, brinkley, s, departure, andrews, professor, of, astronomy, and, royal, astronomer, of, ireland, 209, despite, having, his, undergraduate, career, cut, short, in, this, way, he, earned, degrees, in, both, classics, and, mathematics, ba, in, 1827, ma, in, 1837, in, 1824, hamilton, was, introduced, at, edgeworthstown, to, the, novelist, maria, edgeworth, by, the, rev, richard, butler, the, vicar, of, trim, county, meath, to, whom, his, uncle, james, hamilton, was, curate, 5, 34, during, the, same, period, his, uncle, introduced, him, to, the, disney, family, at, summerhill, house, county, meath, the, disney, sons, attended, trinity, college, and, hamilton, had, friends, among, them, at, summerhill, he, met, catherine, disney, their, sister, 37, hamilton, was, attracted, to, catherine, disney, but, her, family, did, not, approve, and, catherine, was, required, to, marry, the, rev, william, barlow, a, brother, of, her, elder, sister, s, husband, the, wedding, took, place, in, 1825, 109, 113, hamilton, wrote, in, 1826, about, his, feelings, for, her, in, an, extended, poem, the, enthusiast, over, twenty, years, later, in, 1847, he, confided, in, john, herschel, that, during, this, period, he, might, have, become, a, poet, in, 1825, hamilton, met, arabella, lawrence, younger, sister, of, sarah, lawrence, a, significant, correspondent, and, frank, critic, of, his, poetry, it, was, a, contact, he, made, through, maria, edgeworth, s, circle, 26, hamilton, now, royal, astronomer, of, ireland, took, up, residence, at, dunsink, observatory, where, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, he, was, there, from, 1827, until, his, death, in, 1865, in, his, early, years, at, dunsink, hamilton, observed, the, heavens, quite, regularly, he, left, routine, observation, to, his, assistant, charles, thompson, hamilton, s, sisters, also, supported, the, observatory, s, work, the, introductory, lectures, by, hamilton, in, astronomy, were, celebrated, in, addition, to, his, students, they, attracted, scholars, poets, and, women, felicia, hemans, wrote, her, poem, the, prayer, of, the, lonely, student, after, hearing, one, of, his, lectures, hamilton, invited, his, four, sisters, to, come, and, live, at, the, observatory, in, 1827, and, they, ran, the, household, until, his, marriage, in, 1833, they, included, eliza, mary, hamilton, 1807, 1851, the, poet, in, 1827, hamilton, wrote, to, his, sister, grace, about, some, of, the, lawrence, sisters, having, met, his, sister, eliza, in, dublin, newly, appointed, to, the, observatory, hamilton, set, off, on, a, tour, in, ireland, and, england, with, alexander, nimmo, who, was, coaching, him, on, latitude, and, longitude, one, call, was, to, sarah, lawrence, s, school, at, gateacre, near, liverpool, where, hamilton, had, a, chance, to, assess, the, calculator, master, noakes, they, visited, william, wordsworth, at, rydal, mount, in, september, of, that, year, where, the, writer, caesar, otway, was, also, present, 410, after, the, visit, hamilton, sent, numerous, poems, to, wordsworth, becoming, a, poetic, disciple, when, wordsworth, visited, dublin, in, the, summer, of, 1829, in, a, party, with, john, marshall, and, his, family, he, stayed, at, dunsink, with, hamilton, 411, on, a, second, tour, in, england, with, nimmo, in, 1831, hamilton, parted, from, him, at, birmingham, to, visit, the, lawrence, sisters, and, family, on, his, mother, s, side, in, the, liverpool, area, they, met, up, again, in, the, lake, district, where, they, climbed, helvellyn, and, had, tea, with, wordsworth, hamilton, returned, to, dublin, via, edinburgh, and, glasgow, hamilton, visited, samuel, taylor, coleridge, at, highgate, in, 1832, helped, by, an, unexpected, letter, of, introduction, given, to, him, by, sarah, lawrence, on, a, visit, to, liverpool, in, march, of, that, year, he, also, paid, a, call, with, arabella, on, the, family, of, william, roscoe, who, had, died, in, 1831, he, was, a, christian, described, as, a, lover, of, the, bible, an, orthodox, and, attached, member, of, the, established, church, and, as, having, a, profound, conviction, of, the, truth, of, revealed, religion, while, attending, trinity, college, hamilton, proposed, to, his, friend, s, sister, whose, refusal, drove, the, young, hamilton, to, depression, and, illness, even, to, the, verge, of, suicide, he, proposed, again, in, 1831, to, ellen, de, vere, a, sister, of, the, poet, aubrey, de, vere, who, declined, as, well, hamilton, eventually, married, helen, marie, bayly, in, 1833, a, country, preacher, s, daughter, and, had, three, children, with, her, william, edwin, hamilton, born, 1834, archibald, henry, born, 1835, and, helen, elizabeth, born, 1840, hamilton, s, married, life, turned, out, to, be, difficult, and, unhappy, as, bayly, proved, to, be, pious, shy, timid, and, chronically, ill, hamilton, retained, his, faculties, unimpaired, to, the, last, and, continued, the, task, of, finishing, the, elements, of, quaternions, which, had, occupied, the, last, six, years, of, his, life, he, died, on, 2, september, 1865, following, a, severe, attack, of, gout, he, is, buried, in, mount, jerome, cemetery, in, dublin, hamilton, made, outstanding, contributions, to, classical, mechanics, and, optics, his, first, discovery, was, in, an, early, paper, that, he, communicated, in, 1823, to, john, brinkley, who, presented, it, under, the, title, of, caustics, in, 1824, to, the, royal, irish, academy, it, was, referred, as, usual, to, a, committee, which, recommended, further, development, and, simplification, before, publication, between, 1825, and, 1828, the, paper, was, expanded, and, became, a, clearer, exposition, of, a, novel, method, over, this, period, hamilton, gained, an, appreciation, for, the, nature, and, importance, of, optics, in, 1827, hamilton, presented, a, theory, of, a, single, function, now, known, as, hamilton, s, principal, function, that, brings, together, mechanics, and, optical, theory, it, helped, to, establish, the, foundations, of, the, wave, theory, of, light, in, mathematical, physics, he, proposed, it, when, he, first, predicted, its, existence, in, the, third, supplement, to, his, systems, of, rays, read, in, 1832, the, royal, irish, academy, paper, was, finally, entitled, theory, of, systems, of, rays, 23, april, 1827, and, the, first, part, was, printed, in, 1828, in, the, transactions, of, the, royal, irish, academy, the, more, important, contents, of, the, second, and, third, parts, appeared, in, the, three, voluminous, supplements, to, the, first, part, which, were, published, in, the, same, transactions, and, in, the, two, papers, on, a, general, method, in, dynamics, which, appeared, in, the, philosophical, transactions, in, 1834, and, 1835, in, these, papers, hamilton, developed, his, central, principle, of, varying, action, a, result, of, this, work, is, a, prediction, for, transparent, biaxial, crystals, i, e, monoclinic, orthorhombic, or, triclinic, crystals, a, ray, of, light, entering, such, a, crystal, at, a, certain, angle, would, emerge, as, a, hollow, cone, of, rays, this, discovery, was, known, as, conical, refraction, hamilton, found, it, from, the, geometry, of, the, wave, surface, introduced, by, augustin, jean, fresnel, which, has, singular, point, there, is, a, basic, mathematical, explanation, of, the, phenomenon, namely, that, the, wave, surface, is, not, the, boundary, of, a, convex, body, a, fuller, understanding, awaited, the, microlocal, analysis, of, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, the, step, from, optics, to, dynamics, in, the, application, of, the, method, of, varying, action, was, made, in, 1827, and, communicated, to, the, royal, society, in, whose, philosophical, transactions, for, 1834, and, 1835, there, are, two, papers, on, the, subject, hamiltonian, mechanics, was, a, powerful, new, technique, for, working, with, equations, of, motion, hamilton, s, advances, enlarged, the, class, of, mechanical, problems, that, could, be, solved, his, principle, of, varying, action, was, based, on, the, calculus, of, variations, in, the, general, class, of, problems, included, under, the, principle, of, least, action, which, had, been, studied, earlier, by, pierre, louis, maupertuis, euler, joseph, louis, lagrange, and, others, hamilton, s, analysis, uncovered, a, deeper, mathematical, structure, than, had, been, previously, understood, in, particular, a, symmetry, between, momentum, and, position, the, credit, for, discovering, what, are, now, called, the, lagrangian, and, lagrange, s, equations, also, belongs, to, hamilton, both, the, lagrangian, mechanics, and, hamiltonian, approaches, have, proven, important, in, the, study, of, continuous, classical, systems, in, physics, and, quantum, mechanical, systems, the, techniques, find, use, in, electromagnetism, quantum, mechanics, relativity, theory, and, quantum, field, theory, in, the, dictionary, of, irish, biography, david, spearman, writes, the, formulation, that, he, devised, for, classical, mechanics, proved, to, be, equally, suited, to, quantum, theory, whose, development, it, facilitated, the, hamiltonian, formalism, shows, no, signs, of, obsolescence, new, ideas, continue, to, find, this, the, most, natural, medium, for, their, description, and, development, and, the, function, that, is, now, universally, known, as, the, hamiltonian, is, the, starting, point, for, calculation, in, almost, any, area, of, physics, many, scientists, including, liouville, jacobi, darboux, poincar, kolmogorov, prigogine, and, arnold, have, extended, hamilton, s, work, in, mechanics, differential, equations, and, symplectic, geometry, hamilton, s, mathematical, studies, seem, to, have, been, undertaken, and, carried, to, their, full, development, without, collaboration, and, his, writings, do, not, belong, to, any, particular, school, he, was, intended, by, the, university, authorities, who, elected, him, to, the, professorship, of, astronomy, to, spend, his, time, as, he, best, could, for, the, advancement, of, science, without, restrictions, hamilton, made, his, discovery, of, the, algebra, of, quaternions, in, 1843, 210, among, much, prior, related, work, in, 1840, benjamin, olinde, rodrigues, had, reached, a, result, that, amounted, to, their, discovery, in, all, but, name, hamilton, was, looking, for, ways, of, extending, complex, numbers, which, can, be, viewed, as, points, on, a, 2, dimensional, argand, diagram, to, higher, spatial, dimensions, in, working, with, four, dimensions, rather, than, three, he, created, quaternion, algebra, according, to, hamilton, on, 16, october, he, was, out, walking, along, the, royal, canal, in, dublin, with, his, wife, when, the, solution, in, the, form, of, the, equation, occurred, to, him, hamilton, then, carved, this, equation, using, his, penknife, into, the, side, of, the, nearby, broom, bridge, which, hamilton, called, brougham, bridge, 210, the, quaternions, involved, abandoning, the, commutative, law, a, radical, step, for, the, time, in, the, context, of, this, prototype, geometric, algebra, hamilton, also, introduced, the, cross, and, dot, products, of, vector, algebra, the, quaternion, product, being, the, cross, product, minus, the, dot, product, as, scalar, hamilton, also, described, a, quaternion, as, an, ordered, four, element, multiple, of, real, numbers, and, described, the, first, element, as, the, scalar, part, and, the, remaining, three, as, the, vector, part, he, coined, the, neologisms, tensor, and, scalar, and, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, vector, in, the, modern, sense, hamilton, looked, into, the, solution, of, the, quintic, in, the, theory, of, equations, examining, the, results, arrived, at, by, niels, henrik, abel, george, jerrard, and, others, in, their, researches, there, is, hamilton, s, paper, on, fluctuating, functions, in, fourier, analysis, and, the, invention, of, the, hodograph, of, his, investigations, into, the, solutions, especially, by, numerical, approximation, of, certain, classes, of, physically, important, differential, equations, only, parts, were, published, at, intervals, in, the, philosophical, magazine, hamilton, also, introduced, the, icosian, game, or, hamilton, s, puzzle, it, is, based, on, the, concept, of, a, hamiltonian, path, in, graph, theory, hamilton, introduced, as, a, method, of, analysis, both, quaternions, and, biquaternions, the, extension, to, eight, dimensions, by, the, introduction, of, complex, number, coefficients, when, his, work, was, assembled, in, 1853, the, book, lectures, on, quaternions, had, formed, the, subject, of, successive, courses, of, lectures, delivered, in, 1848, and, subsequent, years, in, the, halls, of, trinity, college, dublin, hamilton, confidently, declared, that, quaternions, would, be, found, to, have, a, powerful, influence, as, an, instrument, of, research, when, he, died, hamilton, was, working, on, a, definitive, statement, of, quaternion, science, his, son, william, edwin, hamilton, brought, the, elements, of, quaternions, a, hefty, volume, of, 762, pages, to, publication, in, 1866, as, copies, ran, short, a, second, edition, was, prepared, by, charles, jasper, joly, when, the, book, was, split, into, two, volumes, the, first, appearing, in, 1899, and, the, second, in, 1901, the, subject, index, and, footnotes, in, this, second, edition, improved, the, elements, accessibility, hamilton, was, twice, awarded, the, cunningham, medal, of, the, royal, irish, academy, the, first, award, in, 1834, was, for, his, work, on, conical, refraction, for, which, he, also, received, the, royal, medal, of, the, royal, society, the, following, year, he, was, to, win, it, again, in, 1848, in, 1835, being, secretary, to, the, meeting, of, the, british, association, which, was, held, that, year, in, dublin, hamilton, was, knighted, by, the, lord, lieutenant, other, honours, rapidly, succeeded, among, which, his, election, in, 1837, to, the, president, s, chair, in, the, royal, irish, academy, and, the, rare, distinction, of, being, made, a, corresponding, member, of, the, saint, petersburg, academy, of, sciences, later, in, 1864, the, newly, established, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, elected, its, first, foreign, associates, and, decided, to, put, hamilton, s, name, on, top, of, their, list, a, plaque, under, the, broom, bridge, associated, with, the, discovery, of, quaternions, was, unveiled, by, amon, de, valera, on, 13, november, 1958, since, 1989, the, national, university, of, ireland, maynooth, has, organised, a, pilgrimage, called, the, hamilton, walk, in, which, mathematicians, take, a, walk, from, dunsink, observatory, to, the, bridge, where, no, trace, of, the, carving, remains, though, a, stone, plaque, does, commemorate, the, discovery, the, hamilton, institute, is, an, applied, mathematics, research, institute, at, maynooth, university, and, the, royal, irish, academy, holds, an, annual, public, hamilton, lecture, at, which, murray, gell, mann, frank, wilczek, andrew, wiles, and, timothy, gowers, have, all, spoken, 2005, was, the, 200th, anniversary, of, hamilton, s, birth, and, the, irish, government, designated, that, the, hamilton, year, celebrating, irish, science, trinity, college, dublin, marked, the, year, by, launching, the, hamilton, mathematics, institute, two, commemorative, stamps, were, issued, by, ireland, in, 1943, to, mark, the, centenary, of, the, announcement, of, quaternions, a, 10, euro, commemorative, silver, proof, coin, was, issued, by, the, central, bank, of, ireland, in, 2005, to, commemorate, 200, years, since, his, birth, it, is, believed, by, some, modern, mathematicians, that, hamilton, s, work, on, quaternions, was, satirized, by, charles, lutwidge, dodgson, in, alice, in, wonderland, in, particular, the, mad, hatter, s, tea, party, was, meant, to, represent, the, folly, of, quaternions, and, the, need, to, revert, to, euclidean, geometry, in, september, 2022, evidence, was, presented, to, counter, this, suggestion, which, appears, to, have, been, based, on, an, incorrect, understanding, of, both, quaternions, and, their, history, hamilton, married, helen, bayly, daughter, of, rev, henry, bayly, rector, of, nenagh, county, tipperary, in, 1833, she, was, a, sister, of, neighbours, to, the, observatory, 108, they, had, three, children, the, journalist, william, edwin, hamilton, born, 1834, archibald, henry, born, 1835, and, helen, eliza, amelia, born, 1840, helen, stayed, with, her, widowed, mother, at, bayly, farm, nenagh, for, extended, periods, until, her, mother, s, death, in, 1837, she, also, was, away, from, dunsink, staying, with, sisters, for, much, of, the, time, from, 1840, to, 1842, hamilton, s, married, life, was, reportedly, difficult, 209, in, the, troubled, period, of, the, early, 1840s, his, sister, sydney, ran, his, household, when, helen, returned, he, was, happier, after, some, depression, 125, 126
