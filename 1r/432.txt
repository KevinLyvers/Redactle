unpublished, the, banshee, the, last, unction, and, the, hunchback, or, the, man, unseen, gibran, discussed, such, themes, as, religion, justice, free, will, science, love, happiness, the, soul, the, body, and, death, in, his, writings, which, were, characterized, by, innovation, breaking, with, forms, of, the, past, by, symbolism, an, undying, love, for, his, native, land, and, a, sentimental, melancholic, yet, often, oratorical, style, according, to, salma, jayyusi, roger, allen, and, others, gibran, as, the, leading, poet, of, the, mahjar, school, belongs, to, romantic, neo, romantic, movement, about, his, language, in, general, both, in, arabic, and, english, salma, khadra, jayyusi, remarks, that, because, of, the, spiritual, and, universal, aspect, of, his, general, themes, he, seems, to, have, chosen, a, vocabulary, less, idiomatic, than, would, normally, have, been, chosen, by, a, modern, poet, conscious, of, modernism, in, language, according, to, jean, gibran, and, kahlil, g, gibran, ignoring, much, of, the, traditional, vocabulary, and, form, of, classical, arabic, he, began, to, develop, a, style, which, reflected, the, ordinary, language, he, had, heard, as, a, child, in, besharri, and, to, which, he, was, still, exposed, in, the, south, end, this, use, of, the, colloquial, was, more, a, product, of, his, isolation, than, of, a, specific, intent, but, it, appealed, to, thousands, of, arab, immigrants, the, poem, you, have, your, language, and, i, have, mine, 1924, was, published, in, response, to, criticism, of, his, arabic, language, and, style, according, to, bushrui, and, jenkins, an, inexhaustible, source, of, influence, on, gibran, was, the, bible, especially, the, king, james, version, gibran, s, literary, oeuvre, is, also, steeped, in, the, syriac, tradition, according, to, haskell, gibran, once, told, her, that, the, bible, is, syriac, literature, in, english, words, it, is, the, child, of, a, sort, of, marriage, there, s, nothing, in, any, other, tongue, to, correspond, to, the, english, bible, and, the, chaldo, syriac, is, the, most, beautiful, language, that, man, has, made, though, it, is, no, longer, used, as, worded, by, waterfield, the, parables, of, the, new, testament, affected, his, parables, and, homilies, while, the, poetry, of, some, of, the, old, testament, books, affected, his, devotional, language, and, incantational, rhythms, annie, salem, otto, notes, that, gibran, avowedly, imitated, the, style, of, the, bible, whereas, other, arabic, authors, from, his, time, like, rihani, unconsciously, imitated, the, quran, according, to, ghougassian, the, works, of, english, poet, william, blake, played, a, special, role, in, gibran, s, life, and, in, particular, gibran, agreed, with, blake, s, apocalyptic, vision, of, the, world, as, the, latter, expressed, it, in, his, poetry, and, art, gibran, wrote, of, blake, as, the, god, man, and, of, his, drawings, as, so, far, the, profoundest, things, done, in, english, and, his, vision, putting, aside, his, drawings, and, poems, is, the, most, godly, according, to, george, nicolas, el, hage, there, is, evidence, that, gibran, knew, some, of, blake, s, poetry, and, was, familiar, with, his, drawings, during, his, early, years, in, boston, however, this, knowledge, of, blake, was, neither, deep, nor, complete, kahlil, gibran, was, reintroduced, to, william, blake, s, poetry, and, art, in, paris, most, likely, in, auguste, rodin, s, studio, and, by, rodin, himself, gibran, was, also, a, great, admirer, of, syrian, poet, and, writer, francis, marrash, whose, works, gibran, had, studied, at, the, coll, ge, de, la, sagesse, according, to, shmuel, moreh, gibran, s, own, works, echo, marrash, s, style, including, the, structure, of, some, of, his, works, and, many, of, ideas, on, enslavement, education, women, s, liberation, truth, the, natural, goodness, of, man, and, the, corrupted, morals, of, society, bushrui, and, jenkins, have, mentioned, marrash, s, concept, of, universal, love, in, particular, in, having, left, a, profound, impression, on, gibran, another, influence, on, gibran, was, american, poet, walt, whitman, whom, gibran, followed, by, pointing, up, the, universality, of, all, men, and, by, delighting, in, nature, according, to, el, hage, the, influence, of, german, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, did, not, appear, in, gibran, s, writings, until, the, tempests, nevertheless, although, nietzsche, s, style, no, doubt, fascinated, him, gibran, was, not, the, least, under, his, spell, the, teachings, of, almustafa, are, decisively, different, from, zarathustra, s, philosophy, and, they, betray, a, striking, imitation, of, jesus, the, way, gibran, pictured, him, gibran, was, neglected, by, scholars, and, critics, for, a, long, time, bushrui, and, john, m, munro, have, argued, that, the, failure, of, serious, western, critics, to, respond, to, gibran, resulted, from, the, fact, that, his, works, though, for, the, most, part, originally, written, in, english, cannot, be, comfortably, accommodated, within, the, western, literary, tradition, according, to, el, hage, critics, have, also, generally, failed, to, understand, the, poet, s, conception, of, imagination, and, his, fluctuating, tendencies, towards, nature, according, to, waterfield, gibran, was, confirmed, in, his, aspiration, to, be, a, symbolist, painter, after, working, in, marcel, b, ronneau, s, studio, in, paris, oil, paint, was, gibran, s, preferred, medium, between, 1908, and, 1914, but, before, and, after, this, time, he, worked, primarily, with, pencil, ink, watercolor, and, gouache, in, a, letter, to, haskell, gibran, wrote, that, among, all, the, english, artists, turner, is, the, very, greatest, in, her, diary, entry, of, march, 17, 1911, haskell, recorded, that, gibran, told, her, he, was, inspired, by, j, m, w, turner, s, painting, the, slave, ship, 1840, to, utilize, raw, colors, one, over, another, on, the, canvas, instead, of, killing, them, first, on, the, palette, in, what, would, become, the, painting, rose, sleeves, 1911, telfair, museums, gibran, created, more, than, seven, hundred, visual, artworks, including, the, temple, of, art, portrait, series, his, works, may, be, seen, at, the, gibran, museum, in, bsharri, the, telfair, museums, in, savannah, georgia, the, museo, soumaya, in, mexico, city, mathaf, arab, museum, of, modern, art, in, doha, the, brooklyn, museum, and, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, city, and, the, harvard, art, museums, a, possible, gibran, painting, was, the, subject, of, a, september, 2008, episode, of, the, pbs, tv, series, history, detectives, according, to, bushrui, and, jenkins, although, brought, up, as, a, maronite, christian, see, childhood, gibran, as, an, arab, was, influenced, not, only, by, his, own, religion, but, also, by, islam, especially, by, the, mysticism, of, the, sufis, his, knowledge, of, lebanon, s, bloody, history, with, its, destructive, factional, struggles, strengthened, his, belief, in, the, fundamental, unity, of, religions, besides, christianity, islam, and, sufism, gibran, s, mysticism, was, also, influenced, by, theosophy, and, jungian, psychology, around, 1911, 1912, gibran, met, with, abdu, l, bah, the, leader, of, the, bah, faith, who, was, visiting, the, united, states, to, draw, his, portrait, the, meeting, made, a, strong, impression, on, gibran, one, of, gibran, s, acquaintances, later, in, life, juliet, thompson, herself, a, bah, reported, that, gibran, was, unable, to, sleep, the, night, before, meeting, him, this, encounter, with, abdu, l, bah, later, inspired, gibran, to, write, jesus, the, son, of, man, that, portrays, jesus, through, the, words, of, seventy, seven, contemporaries, who, knew, him, enemies, and, friends, syrians, romans, jews, priests, and, poets, after, the, death, of, abdu, l, bah, gibran, gave, a, talk, on, religion, with, bah, s, and, at, another, event, with, a, viewing, of, a, movie, of, abdu, l, bah, gibran, rose, to, proclaim, in, tears, an, exalted, station, of, abdu, l, bah, and, left, the, event, weeping, in, the, poem, the, voice, of, the, poet, published, in, a, tear, and, a, smile, 1914, gibran, wrote, you, are, my, brother, and, i, love, you, i, love, you, when, you, prostrate, yourself, in, your, mosque, and, kneel, in, your, church, and, pray, in, your, synagogue, you, and, i, are, sons, of, one, faith, the, spirit, and, those, that, are, set, up, as, heads, over, its, many, branches, are, as, fingers, on, the, hand, of, a, divinity, that, points, to, the, spirit, s, perfection, in, 1921, gibran, participated, in, an, interrogatory, meeting, on, the, question, do, we, need, a, new, world, religion, to, unite, the, old, religions, at, st, mark, s, church, in, the, bowery, according, to, young, during, the, last, years, of, gibran, s, life, there, was, much, pressure, put, upon, him, from, time, to, time, to, return, to, lebanon, his, countrymen, there, felt, that, he, would, be, a, great, leader, for, his, people, if, he, could, be, persuaded, to, accept, such, a, role, he, was, deeply, moved, by, their, desire, to, have, him, in, their, midst, but, he, knew, that, to, go, to, lebanon, would, be, a, grave, mistake, i, believe, i, could, be, a, help, to, my, people, he, said, i, could, even, lead, them, but, they, would, not, be, led, in, their, anxiety, and, confusion, of, mind, they, look, about, for, some, solution, to, their, difficulties, if, i, went, to, lebanon, and, took, the, little, black, book, and, said, come, let, us, live, in, this, light, their, enthusiasm, for, me, would, immediately, evaporate, i, am, not, a, politician, and, i, would, not, be, a, politician, no, i, cannot, fulfill, their, desire, nevertheless, gibran, called, for, the, adoption, of, arabic, as, a, national, language, of, syria, considered, from, a, geographic, point, of, view, not, as, a, political, entity, when, gibran, met, abdu, l, bah, in, 1911, 12, who, traveled, to, the, united, states, partly, to, promote, peace, gibran, admired, the, teachings, on, peace, but, argued, that, young, nations, like, his, own, be, freed, from, ottoman, control, gibran, also, wrote, the, famous, pity, the, nation, poem, during, these, years, posthumously, published, in, the, garden, of, the, prophet, on, may, 26, 1916, gibran, wrote, a, letter, to, mary, haskell, that, reads, the, famine, in, mount, lebanon, has, been, planned, and, instigated, by, the, turkish, government, already, 80, 000, have, succumbed, to, starvation, and, thousands, are, dying, every, single, day, the, same, process, happened, with, the, christian, armenians, and, applied, to, the, christians, in, mount, lebanon, gibran, dedicated, a, poem, named, dead, are, my, people, to, the, fallen, of, the, famine, when, the, ottomans, were, eventually, driven, from, syria, during, world, war, i, gibran, sketched, a, euphoric, drawing, free, syria, which, was, then, printed, on, the, special, edition, cover, of, the, arabic, language, paper, as, sayeh, the, traveler, founded, 1912, in, new, york, by, haddad, adel, beshara, reports, that, in, a, draft, of, a, play, still, kept, among, his, papers, gibran, expressed, great, hope, for, national, independence, and, progress, this, play, according, to, khalil, hawi, defines, gibran, s, belief, in, syrian, nationalism, with, great, clarity, distinguishing, it, from, both, lebanese, and, arab, nationalism, and, showing, us, that, nationalism, lived, in, his, mind, even, at, this, late, stage, side, by, side, with, internationalism, according, to, waterfield, gibran, was, not, entirely, in, favour, of, socialism, which, he, believed, tends, to, seek, the, lowest, common, denominator, rather, than, bringing, out, the, best, in, people, the, popularity, of, the, prophet, grew, markedly, during, the, 1960s, with, the, american, counterculture, and, then, with, the, flowering, of, the, new, age, movements, it, has, remained, popular, with, these, and, with,
