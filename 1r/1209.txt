relations, between, buenos, aires, and, the, upper, peru, ended, with, the, commercial, monopoly, of, lima, which, caused, greater, competition, for, the, manufacturers, of, cuzco, they, needed, to, sell, their, merchandise, in, potos, but, had, to, compete, with, producers, of, buenos, aires, and, even, of, spain, on, the, other, hand, the, widespread, overproduction, throughout, the, andes, pushed, prices, down, furthermore, in, the, years, 1778, and, 1779, extremely, cold, weather, damaged, crops, and, made, travel, difficult, in, 1780, amaru, who, also, experienced, this, crisis, had,

the, indigenous, people, in, his, charge, however, he, was, affected, like, the, rest, of, the, population, due, to, the, establishment, of, customs, and, the, rise, of, the, alcabalas, taxes, he, voiced, his, objection, against, these, issues, he, also, demanded, that, the, indigenous, people, be, freed, from, compulsory, work, in, the, mines, claims, directed, through, the, regular, channels, to, the, colonial, authorities, in, tinta, cusco, and, later, in, lima, obtaining, negatives, or, indifference, in, addition, he, adopted, the, name, tupaq, amaru, ii, in, honor, of, his, ancestor, tupaq, amaru, i, the, last, sapa, inca, of, the, neo, inca, state, seeking, to, be, recognized, for, his, royal, inca, lineage, although, the, spanish, trusteeship, labor, system, or, encomienda, had, been, abolished, in, 1720, a, seventh, of, the, population, living, in, native, communities, pueblos, de, indios, as, well, as, permanent, indigenous, workers, at, the, time, living, in, the, andean, region, of, what, is, now, ecuador, and, bolivia, who, made, up, nine, tenths, of, the, population, were, still, pushed, into, forced, labor, for, what, were, legally, labeled, as, public, work, projects, this, shift, from, the, encomienda, to, the, state, sponsored, and, controlled, draft, labor, system, consolidated, the, indigenous, labor, force, in, the, hands, of, the, local, government, and, not, in, the, individual, encomenderos, most, natives, worked, under, the, supervision, of, a, master, either, tilling, soil, mining, or, working, in, textile, mills, what, little, wage, that, was, acquired, by, workers, was, heavily, taxed, and, cemented, native, american, indebtedness, to, spanish, masters, the, roman, catholic, church, also, had, a, hand, in, extorting, these, natives, through, collections, for, saints, masses, for, the, dead, domestic, and, parochial, work, on, certain, days, forced, gifts, etc, those, not, employed, in, forced, labor, were, still, subject, to, the, spanish, provincial, governors, or, corregidores, who, also, heavily, taxed, and, overpriced, commodities, to, any, free, natives, similarly, ensuring, their, financial, instability, in, addition, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, mining, production, intensified, putting, more, and, more, of, a, burden, on, the, mita, or, draft, labor, system, while, potosi, s, mining, mita, had, already, been, dangerous, and, labor, intensive, work, as, well, as, forcing, a, migration, by, both, the, native, worker, and, sometimes, their, families, to, potosi, to, work, the, labor, became, more, extractive, during, this, time, even, though, no, new, veins, of, ore, had, been, discovered, indeed, many, future, rebellious, areas, centered, around, potosi, and, the, mining, district, condorcanqui, s, interest, in, the, native, american, cause, had, been, spurred, by, the, re, reading, of, one, of, the, royal, commentaries, of, the, incas, a, romantic, and, heroic, account, of, the, history, and, culture, of, the, ancient, incas, the, book, was, outlawed, at, the, time, by, the, lima, viceroy, for, fear, of, it, inspiring, renewed, interest, in, the, lost, inca, culture, and, inciting, rebellion, the, marquis, s, native, pride, coupled, with, his, hate, for, the, spanish, colonial, system, caused, him, to, sympathize, and, frequently, petition, for, the, improvement, of, native, labor, in, the, mills, farms, and, mines, even, using, his, own, wealth, to, help, alleviate, the, taxes, and, burdens, of, the, natives, after, many, of, his, requests, for, the, alleviation, of, the, native, conditions, fell, on, deaf, ears, condorcanqui, decided, to, organize, a, rebellion, he, began, to, stall, on, collecting, reparto, debts, and, tribute, payments, for, which, the, tinta, corregidor, and, governor, antonio, de, arriaga, threatened, him, with, death, condorcanqui, changed, his, name, to, tupaq, amaru, ii, and, claimed, he, was, descended, from, the, last, inca, ruler, tupaq, amaru, the, tupaq, amaru, rebellion, was, an, inca, revival, movement, that, sought, to, improve, the, rights, of, indigenous, peruvians, suffering, under, the, spanish, bourbon, reforms, the, rebellion, was, one, of, many, indigenous, peruvian, uprisings, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, it, began, with, the, capture, and, killing, of, the, tinta, corregidor, and, governor, antonio, de, arriaga, on, november, 4, 1780, after, a, banquet, attended, by, both, tupaq, amaru, ii, and, governor, arriaga, the, immediate, cause, of, the, rebellion, lay, in, grievances, caused, by, a, series, of, modernising, reforms, of, the, colonial, administration, implemented, by, the, bourbon, monarchy, in, spain, under, charles, iii, 1759, 88, centralising, administrative, and, economic, control, and, placing, heavier, tax, and, labour, burdens, on, both, the, indian, and, creole, populations, the, focus, of, discontent, was, the, main, representative, of, the, crown, in, peru, the, visitador, general, jos, antonio, areche, ideologically, the, rebellion, was, complex, at, one, level, it, expressed, simply, a, demand, on, the, spanish, authorities, for, changes, and, reforms, within, the, structure, of, colonial, rule, often, speaking, in, the, name, of, the, king, himself, for, example, at, another, it, envisioned, an, overthrow, of, european, rule, and, something, like, a, restoration, of, the, pre, conquest, inca, empire, the, tahuantinsuyo, tupaq, amaru, s, claim, to, be, the, legitimate, descendant, of, the, inca, suggested, the, possibility, of, an, aristocratic, state, similar, to, the, one, envisioned, in, the, sixteenth, century, by, the, mestizo, writer, inca, garcilaso, de, la, vega, who, saw, the, incas, as, sharing, rule, with, the, spanish, aristocracy, but, there, were, also, strong, millenarian, proto, jacobin, and, even, proto, communist, elements, in, the, rebellion, in, the, main, the, soldiers, of, the, tupamarista, armies, were, poor, indian, peasants, artisans, and, women, who, saw, the, rebellion, not, so, much, as, a, question, of, reforms, or, power, sharing, but, as, an, opportunity, to, turn, the, world, upside, down, the, restoration, of, the, inca, empire, meant, for, them, the, possibility, of, an, egalitarian, society, based, economically, on, the, inca, communal, agricultural, system, the, ayllu, and, one, without, castas, racial, divisions, rich, and, poor, or, forced, labour, in, haciendas, mines, and, factories, particularly, the, dreaded, textile, mills, when, arriaga, left, the, party, drunk, tupaq, amaru, ii, and, several, of, his, allies, captured, him, and, forced, him, to, write, letters, to, a, large, number, of, spaniards, and, kurakas, when, about, 200, of, them, gathered, within, the, next, few, days, tupaq, amaru, ii, surrounded, them, with, approximately, 4, 000, natives, claiming, that, he, was, acting, under, direct, orders, from, the, spanish, crown, amaru, ii, gave, arriaga, s, slave, antonio, oblitas, the, privilege, of, executing, his, master, a, platform, in, the, middle, of, a, local, town, plaza, was, erected, and, the, initial, attempt, at, hanging, the, corregidor, failed, when, the, noose, snapped, arriaga, then, ran, for, his, life, to, try, to, reach, a, nearby, church, but, was, not, quick, enough, to, escape, and, was, successfully, hanged, on, the, second, attempt, after, the, execution, of, de, arriaga, amaru, ii, continued, his, insurrection, releasing, his, first, proclamation, tupaq, amaru, ii, announced, that, there, have, been, repeated, outcries, directed, to, me, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, this, and, surrounding, provinces, outcries, against, the, abuses, committed, by, european, born, crown, officials, justified, outcries, that, have, produced, no, remedy, from, the, royal, courts, to, all, the, inhabitants, of, the, spanish, provinces, he, went, on, in, the, same, proclamation, to, state, i, have, acted, only, against, the, mentioned, abuses, and, to, preserve, the, peace, and, well, being, of, indians, mestizos, mambos, as, well, as, native, born, whites, and, blacks, i, must, now, prepare, for, the, consequences, of, these, actions, tupac, amaru, ii, then, went, on, to, quickly, assemble, an, army, of, 6, 000, natives, who, had, abandoned, their, work, to, join, the, revolt, as, they, marched, towards, cuzco, the, rebels, occupied, the, provinces, of, quispicanchis, tinta, cotabambas, calca, and, chumbivilcas, the, rebels, looted, the, spaniards, houses, and, killed, their, occupants, the, movement, was, supremely, anti, royalist, since, upon, arriving, at, a, town, the, rebels, would, upturn, spanish, authority, women, as, much, as, men, were, affected, by, these, injustices, in, fact, tupaq, amaru, ii, s, wife, micaela, bastidas, commanded, a, battalion, of, insurgents, and, was, responsible, for, the, uprising, in, the, san, felipe, de, tungasuca, region, she, is, also, often, credited, to, being, more, daring, and, a, superior, strategist, compared, to, tupaq, amaru, ii, it, is, told, that, she, scolded, her, husband, for, his, weakness, and, refusal, to, set, up, a, surprise, attack, against, the, spaniards, in, cusco, to, catch, the, weakened, city, defenders, off, guard, instead, of, listening, to, his, wife, tupaq, amaru, ii, lost, precious, time, by, encircling, the, country, in, hopes, that, he, could, gather, more, recruits, for, his, army, so, by, the, time, the, insurgents, had, attacked, the, city, the, spaniards, had, already, brought, in, reinforcements, and, were, able, to, control, and, stop, the, uprising, this, led, to, tupaq, amaru, ii, micaela, bastidas, and, several, others, to, be, captured, while, the, rebels, scattered, during, a, stage, of, his, rebellion, tupaq, amaru, ii, was, able, to, convince, the, quechua, speakers, to, join, him, therefore, under, his, command, the, quechua, speakers, fought, alongside, him, with, aymara, speaking, rebels, from, puno, on, lake, titicaca, and, on, the, bolivian, side, of, the, lake, unfortunately, the, alliance, did, not, last, that, long, and, this, led, the, aymara, leader, t, pac, katari, to, lead, his, army, alone, which, ultimately, led, to, his, capture, in, october, 1781, his, partner, and, female, commander, bartola, sisa, took, control, after, his, capture, and, lead, an, astonishing, number, of, 2, 000, soldiers, for, several, months, soon, after, that, in, early, 1782, the, spanish, military, defeated, the, rebels, in, peru, and, bolivia, according, to, modern, sources, out, of, the, 73, leaders, 32, were, women, who, were, all, executed, privately, on, november, 18, 1780, cusco, dispatched, over, 1, 300, spanish, and, native, loyalist, troops, the, two, opposing, forces, clashed, in, the, town, of, sangarar, it, was, an, absolute, victory, for, amaru, ii, and, his, native, rebels, all, 578, spanish, soldiers, were, killed, and, the, rebels, took, possession, of, their, weapons, and, supplies, the, victory, however, also, came, with, a, price, the, battle, revealed, that, amaru, ii, was, unable, to, fully, control, his, rebel, followers, as, they, viciously, slaughtered, without, direct, orders, reports, of, such, violence, and, the, rebels, insistence, on, the, death, of, spaniards, eliminated, any, chances, for, support, by, the, criollo, class, the, victory, achieved, at, sangarar, would, be, followed, by, a, string, of, defeats, the, gravest, defeat, came, in, amaru, ii, s, failure, to, capture, cuzco, where, his, 40, 000, 60, 000, indigenous, followers, were, repelled, by, the, fortified, town, consisting, of, a, combined, force, of, loyalist, native, troops, and, reinforcements, from, lima, after, being, repelled, from, the, capital, of, the, ancient, inca, empire, and, intellectual, hub, of, colonial, peru, amaru, and, his, men, marched, through, the, countryside, attempting, to, recruit, any, native, to, his, cause, in, doing, so, bolstering, his, forces, amaru, ii, s, army, was, surrounded, between, tinta, and, sangarara, and, he, was, betrayed, by, two, of, his, officers, colonel, ventura, landaeta, and, captain, francisco, cruz, which, led, to, his, capture, when, his, captors, attempted, to, procure, the, names, of, his, rebel, accomplices, from, him, in, exchange, for, promises, amaru, ii, scornfully, replied, there, are, no, accomplices, here, other, than, you, and, i, you, as, oppressor, i, as, liberator, deserve, to, die, amaru, ii, was, sentenced, to, be, executed, he, was, forced, to, watch, the, deaths, of, his, wife, micaela, bastidas, his, eldest, son, hip, lito, his, uncle, francisco, tupa, amaro, his, brother, in, law, antonio, bastidas, and, some, of, his, captains, before, his, own, death, on, may, 18, 1781, they, were, taken, to, the, plaza, de, armas, in, cuzco, to, be, executed, one, by, one, his, son, hip, lito, first, had, his, tongue, cut, out, for, having, spoken, against, the, spanish, and, then, he, was, hanged, micaela, and, jos, gabriel, were, forced, to, witness, the, death, of, their, son, micaela, was, then, made, to, climb, to, the, platform, in, front, of, her, husband, and, her, son, fernando, micaela, fought, against, her, executioners, until, they, finally, subdued, her, and, cut, off, her, tongue, her, thin, neck, could, not, reach, the, winch, so, they, threw, ties, around, her, neck, that, pulled, it, from, side, to, side, to, strangle, her, they, hit, her, with, a, club, and, finally, killed, her, with, kicks, in, the, stomach, and, breasts, the, following, is, an, extract, from, the, official, judicial, death, issued, by, the, spanish, authorities, which, condemns, tupaq, amaru, ii, to, torture, and, death, it, was, ordered, that, tupaq, amaru, ii, be, condemned, to, have, his, tongue, cut, out, after, watching, the, executions, of, his, family, and, to, have, his, hands, and, feet, tied, to, four, horses, who, will, then, be, driven, at, once, toward, the, four, corners, of, the, plaza, pulling, the, arms, and, legs, from, his, body, the, torso, will, then, be, taken, to, the, hill, overlooking, the, city, where, it, will, be, burned, in, a, bonfire, tupac, amaru, s, head, will, be, sent, to, tinta, to, be, displayed, for, three, days, in, the, place, of, public, execution, and, then, placed, upon, a, pike, at, the, principal, entrance, to, the, city, one, of, his, arms, will, be, sent, to, tungasuca, where, he, was, the, cacique, and, the, other, arm, to, the, capital, province, of, carabaya, to, be, similarly, displayed, in, those, locations, his, legs, will, be, sent, to, livitica, and, santa, rosas, in, the, provinces, of, chumbivilcas, and, lampa, respectively, after, the, failed, dismemberment, by, the, four, horses, his, body, was, quartered, and, he, was, then, beheaded, on, the, main, plaza, in, cuzco, in, the, same, place, his, ancestor, tupaq, amaru, i, had, been, beheaded, his, youngest, son, 10, year, old, fernando, was, not, executed, but, was, forced, to, witness, the, torture, and, death, of, his, entire, family, and, to, pass, under, the, gallows, of, those, executed, he, was, later, exiled, to, africa, for, life, imprisonment, however, the, ship, taking, him, there, was, capsized, and, he, ended, up, in, c, diz, to, be, imprisoned, in, the, dungeons, of, the, city, viceroy, agust, n, de, j, uregui, suggested, that, he, should, be, kept, in, spain, fearing, that, some, enemy, power, might, rescue, him, on, the, way, to, africa, scientists, who, have, studied, this, dismemberment, attempt, concluded, that, due, to, the, physical, build, and, resistance, of, tupaq, amaru, ii, it, would, not, have, been, possible, to, dismember, him, in, that, way, however, his, arms, and, legs, were, dislocated, as, was, his, pelvis, despite, the, execution, of, tupaq, amaru, ii, and, his, family, the, vice, regal, government, failed, to, quell, the, rebellion, which, continued, under, the, leadership, of, his, cousin, diego, crist, bal, tupaq, amaru, at, the, same, time, that, it, extended, through, upper, peru, and, the, jujuy, region, likewise, disaffection, of, the, spanish, crown, towards, the, creoles, became, evident, especially, for, the, oruro, case, the, lawsuit, were, filed, against, juan, jos, segovia, born, in, lima, and, colonel, ignacio, flores, born, in, quito, who, had, served, as, president, of, the, real, audiencia, of, charcas, and, as, the, governor, intendant, of, la, plata, chuquisaca, or, charcas, currently, sucre, when, the, revolt, continued, the, spaniards, executed, the, remainder, of, his, family, except, his, 12, year, old, son, fernando, who, had, been, condemned, to, die, with, him, but, was, instead, imprisoned, in, spain, for, the, rest, of, his, life, it, is, not, known, if, any, members, of, the, inca, royal, family, survived, this, final, purge, amaru, s, body, parts, were, strewn, across, the, towns, loyal, to, him, as, ordered, his, houses, were, demolished, their, sites, strewn, with, salt, his, goods, confiscated, his, relatives, declared, infamous, and, all, documents, relating, to, his, descent, burnt, at, the, same, time, on, may, 18, 1781, incan, clothing, and, cultural, traditions, and, self, identification, as, inca, were, outlawed, along, with, other, measures, to, convert, the, population, to, spanish, culture, and, government, until, peru, s, independence, as, a, republic, however, even, after, the, death, of, amaru, native, revolts, still, seized, much, of, what, is, today, southern, peru, bolivia, and, argentina, as, native, revolutionaries, captured, spanish, towns, and, beheaded, many, inhabitants, in, one, instance, a, native, american, army, under, rebel, leader, t, pac, katari, besieged, the, city, of, la, paz, for, 109, days, before, troops, sent, from, buenos, aires, stepped, in, to, relieve, the, city, although, tupaq, amaru, ii, s, rebellion, was, not, a, success, it, marked, the, first, large, scale, rebellion, in, the, spanish, colonies, and, inspired, the, revolt, of, many, natives, and, peruvians, in, the, surrounding, area, the, rebellion, took, on, important, manifestations, in, upper, peru, or, what, is, today, modern, bolivia, including, the, region, south, and, east, of, lake, titicaca, indeed, tupaq, amaru, ii, inspired, the, indigenous, peoples, to, such, an, extent, that, even, the, official, document, wherein, he, is, condemned, to, death, it, is, remarked, that, the, indians, stood, firm, in, the, place, of, our, gunfire, despite, their, enormous, fear, of, it, and, that, despite, being, captured, his, followers, remained, steadfast, in, their, beliefs, in, his, immortality, and, heritage, the, rebellion, gave, indigenous, peruvians, a, new, state, of, mind, a, sort, of, indigenous, nationalism, that, would, re, emerge, and, change, shape, over, the, course, of, the, country, s, future, they, were, now, willing, to, join, forces, with, anyone, who, opposed, the, spanish, as, well, few, peruvians, had, prosperous, co, owned, businesses, and, land, with, the, spaniards, and, as, such, did, not, want, to, lose, those, interests, in, the, event, of, a, revolution, while, tupaq, amaru, ii, s, revolt, was, spawned, in, the, vilcanota, valley, and, ended, in, the, city, of, cuzco, the, legacy, and, ideology, of, his, revolt, had, echoes, throughout, the, andean, region, querr, n, volarlo, y, no, podr, n, volarlo, they, will, want, to, blow, him, up, and, won, t, be, able, to, blow, him, up, querr, n, romperlo, y, no, podr, n, romperlo, they, will, want, to, break, him, and, won, t, be, able, to, break, him, querr, n, matarlo, y, no, podr, n, matarlo, they, will, want, to, kill, him, and, won, t, be, able, to, kill, him, al, tercer, d, a, de, los, sufrimientos, cuando, se, cre, a, todo, consumado, gritando, libertad, sobre, la, tierra, ha, de, volver, y, no, podr, n, matarlo, on, the, third, day, of, suffering, when, it, was, believed, everything, was, finished, he, will, scream, freedom, over, the, land, must, return, and, they, won, t, be, able, to, kill, him, alejandro, romualdo, the, fame, of, tupaq, amaru, ii, spread, to, such, an, extent, that, for, the, indigenous, rebels, in, the, plains, of, casanare, in, the, new, granada, region, he, was, recognized, as, king, of, america, later, movements, invoked, the, name, of, tupaq, amaru, ii, to, obtain, the, support, of, the, indigenous, among, others, felipe, velasco,
