of, the, specialization, of, negro, in, the, title, from, the, mid, 1950s, to, the, mid, 1960s, hughes, s, popularity, among, the, younger, generation, of, black, writers, varied, even, as, his, reputation, increased, worldwide, with, the, gradual, advance, toward, racial, integration, many, black, writers, considered, his, writings, of, black, pride, and, its, corresponding, subject, matter, out, of, date, they, considered, him, a, racial, chauvinist, he, found, some, new, writers, among, them, james, baldwin, lacking, in, such, pride, over, intellectual, in, their, work, and, occasionally, vulgar, hughes, wanted, young, black, writers, to, be, objective, about, their, race, but, not, to, scorn, it, or, flee, it, he, understood, the, main, points, of, the, black, power, movement, of, the, 1960s, but, believed, that, some, of, the, younger, black, writers, who, supported, it, were, too, angry, in, their, work, hughes, s, work, panther, and, the, lash, posthumously, published, in, 1967, was, intended, to, show, solidarity, with, these, writers, but, with, more, skill, and, devoid, of, the, most, virulent, anger, and, racial, chauvinism, some, showed, toward,

to, be, emulated, within, their, own, work, one, of, these, young, black, writers, loften, mitchell, observed, of, hughes, langston, set, a, tone, a, standard, of, brotherhood, and, friendship, and, cooperation, for, all, of, us, to, follow, you, never, got, from, him, i, am, the, negro, writer, but, only, i, am, a, negro, writer, he, never, stopped, thinking, about, the, rest, of, us, hughes, was, drawn, to, communism, as, an, alternative, to, a, segregated, america, many, of, his, lesser, known, political, writings, have, been, collected, in, two, volumes, published, by, the, university, of, missouri, press, and, reflect, his, attraction, to, communism, an, example, is, the, poem, a, new, song, in, 1932, hughes, became, part, of, a, group, of, black, people, who, went, to, the, soviet, union, to, make, a, film, depicting, the, plight, of, african, americans, in, the, united, states, hughes, was, hired, to, write, the, english, dialogue, for, the, film, the, film, was, never, made, but, hughes, was, given, the, opportunity, to, travel, extensively, through, the, soviet, union, and, to, the, soviet, controlled, regions, in, central, asia, the, latter, parts, usually, closed, to, westerners, while, there, he, met, robert, robinson, an, african, american, living, in, moscow, and, unable, to, leave, in, turkmenistan, hughes, met, and, befriended, the, hungarian, author, arthur, koestler, then, a, communist, who, was, given, permission, to, travel, there, as, later, noted, in, koestler, s, autobiography, hughes, together, with, some, forty, other, black, americans, had, originally, been, invited, to, the, soviet, union, to, produce, a, soviet, film, on, negro, life, but, the, soviets, dropped, the, film, idea, because, of, their, 1933, success, in, getting, the, us, to, recognize, the, soviet, union, and, establish, an, embassy, in, moscow, this, entailed, a, toning, down, of, soviet, propaganda, on, racial, segregation, in, america, hughes, and, his, fellow, blacks, were, not, informed, of, the, reasons, for, the, cancellation, but, he, and, koestler, worked, it, out, for, themselves, hughes, also, managed, to, travel, to, china, japan,
