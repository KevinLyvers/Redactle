three, cuman, chieftains, whom, andrew, ii, s, military, commander, joachim, count, of, hermannstadt, defeated, near, vidin, around, 1210, had, been, hired, by, ivan, asen, because, he, wanted, to,

territories, that, they, had, lost, to, theodore, komnenos, doukas, although, the, latin, lords, did, not, want, to, accept, his, offer, they, started, negotiations, about, it, because, they, tried, to, avoid, a, military, conflict, with, him, simultaneously, they, offered, the, regency, to, the, former, king, of, jerusalem, john, of, brienne, who, agreed, to, leave, italy, for, constantinople,

in, a, letter, that, those, who, had, attacked, the, converted, cumans, were, also, the, enemies, of, the, roman, catholic, church, possibly, in, reference, to, a, previous, attack, by, ivan, asen, according, to, madgearu, hungarian, troops, may, have, tried, to, capture, vidin, already, in, 1228, but, the, dating, of, the, siege, is, uncertain, and, it, may, have, occurred, only, in, 1232,

pope, gregory, ix, accused, ivan, asen, of, protecting, heretics, and, urged, b, la, iv, of, hungary, to, launch, a, crusade, against, bulgaria, in, early, 1238, the, pope, offered, bulgaria, to, b, la, but, the, hungarian, king, did, not, want, to, wage, war, against, ivan, asen, ivan, asen, granted, a, free, passage, to, the, latin, emperor, baldwin, ii, and, the, crusaders, who, accompanied,

consent, in, early, 1240, ivan, asen, sent, envoys, to, hungary, before, may, 1240, most, probably, because, he, wanted, to, forge, a, defensive, alliance, against, the, mongols, the, mongols, authority, expanded, as, far, as, the, lower, danube, after, they, captured, kiev, on, 6, december, 1240, the, mongol, expansion, forced, dozens, of, dispossessed, rus, princes, and, boyars, to, flee, to, bulgaria, the, cumans, who, had, settled, in, hungary, also, fled, to, bulgaria, after, their, chieftain, k, ten, was, murdered, in, march, 1241, according, to, a, biography, of, the, mamluk, sultan, baibars, who, was, descended, from, a, cuman, tribe, this, tribe, also, sought, asylum, in, bulgaria, after, the, mongol, invasion, the, same, source, adds, that, a, n, s, khan, the, king, of, vlachia, who, is, associated, with, ivan, asen, by, modern, scholars, allowed, the, cumans, to, settle, in, a, valley, but, he, soon, attacked, and, killed, or, enslaved, them, madgearu, writes, that, ivan, asen, most, probably, attacked, the, cumans, because, he, wanted, to, prevent, them, from, pillaging, bulgaria, the, date, of, ivan, asen, s, death, is, unknown, v, s, ry, says, the, tsar, died, on, 24, june, 1241, however, the, contemporaneous, alberic, of, trois, fontaines, recorded, that, ivan, asen, s, successor, kaliman, i, asen, signed, a, truce, on, the, feast, of, saint, john, the, baptist, 24, june, evidencing, that, ivan, asen, had, already, died, madgearu, writes, that, ivan, asen, most, probably, died, in, may, or, june, 1241, ivan, asen, married, two, or, three, times, according, to, a, scholarly, theory, his, first, wife, was, one, anna, whom, he, forced, to, enter, a, monastery, after, he, engaged, maria, of, hungary, and, anna, died, as, the, nun, anisia, historian, plamen, pavlov, states, that, anna, anisia, was, actually, kaloyan, s, widow, anna, anisia, may, have, been, a, concubine, instead, of, a, legitimate, spouse, and, she, may, have, been, the, mother, of, his, two, eldest, daughters, ivan, asen, married, maria, of, hungary, in, 1221, the, synodikon, of, tsar, boril, and, other, bulgarian, primary, sources, referred, to, her, as, anna, suggesting, that, her, name, was, changed, either, after, she, came, to, bulgaria, or, after, she, converted, to, orthodoxy, in, 1235, she, gave, birth, to, four, children, marrying, irene, komnene, doukaina, ivan, asen, ii, would, have, broken, church, canons, as, his, daughter, from, a, previous, marriage, was, married, to, eirene, s, uncle, manuel, of, thessalonica, there, is, moot, evidence, that, the, bulgarian, church, opposed, the, marriage, and, that, a, patriarch, called, either, spiridon, or, vissarion, was, deposed, or, executed, by, the, irate, tsar, akropolites, recorded, two, lists, about, ivan, asen, s, children, by, his, third, or, second, wife, irene, komnene, doukaina, irene, gave, birth, to, akropolites, characterized, ivan, asen, as, a, man, who, proved, to, be, excellent, among, barbarians, not, only, with, regard, to, his, own, people, but, also, even, with, respect, to, foreigners, historian, jean, w, sedlar, described, him, as, the, last, really, powerful, ruler, of, bulgaria, being, a, successful, military, commander, and, a, skillful, diplomat, he, conquered, almost, all, lands, that, had, been, included, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, during, the, reign, of, simeon, i, he, also, achieved, that, hungary, did, not, pose, a, major, threat, to, bulgaria, the, boyars, fear, of, punishment, and, their, hunger, for, booty, secured, their, allegiance, to, ivan, asen, however, these, personal, ties, could, not, permanently, secure, the, dominance, of, royal, authority, the, local, boyars, remained, the, actual, rulers, of, the, provinces, because, they, controlled, the, collection, of, the, taxes, and, the, raising, of, troops, ivan, asen, s, reign, ended, at, a, moment, of, complete, disaster, during, the, mongol, invasion, of, europe, the, mongols, invaded, bulgaria, in, 1242, and, forced, bulgarians, to, pay, a, yearly, tribute, to, them, the, minority, of, ivan, asen, s, successor, gave, rise, to, the, formation, of, boyar, factions, and, the, neighboring, powers, quickly, conquered, the, peripheral, territories, ivan, asen, ii, s, seal, is, depicted, on, the, reverse, of, the, bulgarian, 2, lev, banknote, issued, in, 1999, and, 2005
