grigori, yefimovich, rasputin, r, s, p, j, u, t, n, russian, 21, january, 1869, 30, december, 1916, was, a, russian, mystic, and, faith, healer, he, is, best, known, for, having, befriended, the, imperial, family, of, nicholas, ii, the, last, emperor, of, russia, through, whom, he, gained, considerable, influence, in, the, final, years, of, the, russian, empire, rasputin, was, born, to, a, family, of, peasants, in, the, siberian, village, of, pokrovskoye, located, within, tyumensky, uyezd, in, tobolsk, governorate, present, day, yarkovsky, district, in, tyumen, oblast, he, had, a, religious, conversion, experience, after, embarking, on, a, pilgrimage, to, a, monastery, in, 1897, and, has, been, described, as, a, monk, or, as, a, strannik, wanderer, or, pilgrim, though, he, held, no, official, position, in, the, russian, orthodox, church, in, 1903, or, in, the, winter, of, 1904, 1905, he, travelled, to, saint, petersburg, and, captivated, a, number, of, religious, and, social, leaders, eventually, becoming, a, prominent, figure, in, russian, society, in, november, 1905, rasputin, met, nicholas, ii, and, his, empress, consort, alexandra, feodorovna, in, late, 1906, rasputin, began, acting, as, a, faith, healer, for, nicholas, and, alexandra, s, only, son, alexei, nikolaevich, who, suffered, from, haemophilia, he, was, a, divisive, figure, at, court, seen, by, some, russians, as, a, mystic, visionary, and, prophet, and, by, others, as, a, religious, charlatan, the, extent, of, rasputin, s, power, reached, an, all, time, high, in, 1915, when, nicholas, left, saint, petersburg, to, oversee, the, imperial, russian, army, as, it, was, engaged, in, the, first, world, war, in, his, absence, rasputin, and, alexandra, consolidated, their, influence, across, the, russian, empire, however, as, russian, military, defeats, mounted, on, the, eastern, front, both, figures, became, increasingly, unpopular, and, in, the, early, morning, of, 30, december, 1916, rasputin, was, assassinated, by, a, group, of, conservative, russian, noblemen, who, opposed, his, influence, over, the, imperial, family, historians, often, suggest, that, rasputin, s, scandalous, and, sinister, reputation, helped, discredit, the, tsarist, government, thus, precipitating, the, overthrow, of, the, house, of, romanov, shortly, after, his, assassination, accounts, of, his, life, and, influence, were, often, based, on, hearsay, and, rumor, he, remains, a, mysterious, and, captivating, figure, in, popular, culture, grigori, yefimovich, rasputin, was, born, a, peasant, in, the, small, village, of, pokrovskoye, along, the, tura, river, in, the, tobolsk, governorate, now, tyumen, oblast, in, the, russian, empire, according, to, official, records, he, was, born, on, 21, january, 1869, and, christened, the, following, day, he, was, named, for, st, gregory, of, nyssa, whose, feast, was, celebrated, on, 10, january, there, are, few, records, of, rasputin, s, parents, his, father, yefim, 1842, 1916, was, a, peasant, farmer, and, church, elder, who, had, been, born, in, pokrovskoye, and, married, rasputin, s, mother, anna, parshukova, c, 1840, 1906, in, 1863, yefim, also, worked, as, a, government, courier, ferrying, people, and, goods, between, tobolsk, and, tyumen, the, couple, had, seven, other, children, all, of, whom, died, in, infancy, and, early, childhood, there, may, have, been, a, ninth, child, feodosiya, according, to, historian, joseph, t, fuhrmann, rasputin, was, certainly, close, to, feodosiya, and, was, godfather, to, her, children, but, the, records, that, have, survived, do, not, permit, us, to, say, more, than, that, according, to, historian, douglas, smith, rasputin, s, youth, and, early, adulthood, are, a, black, hole, about, which, we, know, almost, nothing, though, the, lack, of, reliable, sources, and, information, did, not, stop, others, from, fabricating, stories, about, rasputin, s, parents, and, his, youth, after, his, rise, to, prominence, historians, agree, however, that, like, most, siberian, peasants, including, his, mother, and, father, rasputin, was, not, formally, educated, and, remained, illiterate, well, into, his, early, adulthood, local, archival, records, suggest, that, he, had, a, somewhat, unruly, youth, possibly, involving, drinking, small, thefts, and, disrespect, for, local, authorities, but, contain, no, evidence, of, his, being, charged, with, stealing, horses, blasphemy, or, bearing, false, witness, all, major, crimes, later, imputed, to, him, as, a, young, man, in, 1886, rasputin, traveled, to, abalak, some, 250, km, east, northeast, of, tyumen, and, 2, 800, km, east, of, moscow, where, he, met, a, peasant, girl, named, praskovya, dubrovina, after, a, courtship, of, several, months, they, married, in, february, 1887, praskovya, remained, in, pokrovskoye, throughout, rasputin, s, later, travels, and, rise, to, prominence, and, remained, devoted, to, him, until, his, death, the, couple, had, seven, children, though, only, three, survived, to, adulthood, dmitry, b, 1895, maria, b, 1898, and, varvara, b, 1900, in, 1897, rasputin, developed, a, renewed, interest, in, religion, and, left, pokrovskoye, to, go, on, a, pilgrimage, his, reasons, are, unclear, according, to, some, sources, he, left, the, village, to, escape, punishment, for, his, role, in, horse, theft, other, sources, suggest, rasputin, had, a, vision, of, the, virgin, mary, or, of, st, simeon, of, verkhoturye, while, still, others, suggest, that, his, pilgrimage, was, inspired, by, a, young, theological, student, melity, zaborovsky, whatever, his, reasons, rasputin, cast, off, his, old, life, he, was, 28, years, old, married, ten, years, with, an, infant, son, and, another, child, on, the, way, according, to, smith, his, decision, could, only, have, been, occasioned, by, some, sort, of, emotional, or, spiritual, crisis, rasputin, had, undertaken, earlier, shorter, pilgrimages, to, the, holy, znamensky, monastery, at, abalak, and, to, tobolsk, s, cathedral, but, his, visit, to, the, st, nicholas, monastery, at, verkhoturye, in, 1897, transformed, him, there, he, met, and, was, profoundly, humbled, by, a, starets, elder, known, as, makary, rasputin, may, have, spent, several, months, at, verkhoturye, and, it, was, perhaps, here, that, he, learned, to, read, and, write, however, he, later, claimed, that, some, of, the, monks, at, verkhotuyre, engaged, in, homosexuality, and, criticized, monastic, life, as, too, coercive, he, returned, to, pokrovskoye, a, changed, man, looking, disheveled, and, behaving, differently, he, became, a, vegetarian, swore, off, alcohol, and, prayed, and, sang, much, more, fervently, than, he, had, in, the, past, rasputin, spent, the, years, that, followed, as, a, strannik, a, holy, wanderer, or, pilgrim, leaving, pokrovskoye, for, months, or, even, years, at, a, time, to, wander, the, country, and, visit, a, variety, of, holy, sites, it, is, possible, he, wandered, as, far, as, mount, athos, the, center, of, eastern, orthodox, monastic, life, in, 1900, by, the, early, 1900s, rasputin, had, developed, a, small, circle, of, followers, primarily, family, members, and, other, local, peasants, who, prayed, with, him, on, sundays, and, other, holy, days, when, he, was, in, pokrovskoye, building, a, makeshift, chapel, in, yefim, s, root, cellar, rasputin, was, still, living, within, his, father, s, household, at, the, time, the, group, held, secret, prayer, meetings, there, these, meetings, were, the, subject, of, some, suspicion, and, hostility, from, the, village, priest, and, other, villagers, it, was, rumored, that, female, followers, were, ceremonially, washing, rasputin, before, each, meeting, that, the, group, sang, strange, songs, and, even, that, rasputin, had, joined, the, khlysty, a, religious, sect, whose, ecstatic, rituals, were, rumored, to, include, self, flagellation, and, sexual, orgies, according, to, fuhrmann, however, repeated, investigations, failed, to, establish, that, rasputin, was, ever, a, member, of, the, sect, and, rumors, that, he, was, a, khlyst, appear, to, have, been, unfounded, word, of, rasputin, s, activity, and, charisma, began, to, spread, in, siberia, during, the, early, 1900s, at, some, point, during, 1904, or, 1905, he, traveled, to, the, city, of, kazan, where, he, acquired, a, reputation, as, a, wise, starets, who, could, help, people, resolve, their, spiritual, crises, and, anxieties, despite, rumors, that, rasputin, was, having, sex, with, female, followers, he, made, a, favorable, impression, on, several, local, religious, leaders, among, these, were, archimandrite, andrei, and, bishop, chrysthanos, who, gave, rasputin, a, letter, of, recommendation, to, bishop, sergei, the, rector, of, the, theological, seminary, at, the, alexander, nevsky, monastery, and, arranged, for, him, to, travel, to, saint, petersburg, upon, arriving, at, the, alexander, nevsky, lavra, rasputin, was, introduced, to, church, leaders, including, archimandrite, theofan, inspector, of, the, theological, seminary, who, was, well, connected, in, saint, petersburg, society, and, later, served, as, confessor, to, the, imperial, family, theofan, was, so, impressed, with, rasputin, that, he, invited, him, to, stay, in, his, home, he, went, on, to, become, one, of, rasputin, s, most, important, friends, in, saint, petersburg, gaining, him, entry, to, many, of, the, influential, salons, where, the, local, aristocracy, gathered, for, religious, discussions, it, was, through, these, meetings, that, rasputin, attracted, some, of, his, early, and, influential, followers, many, of, whom, would, later, turn, against, him, alternative, religious, movements, such, as, spiritualism, and, theosophy, had, become, popular, among, saint, petersburg, s, aristocracy, before, rasputin, s, arrival, and, many, of, the, aristocracy, were, intensely, curious, about, the, occult, and, the, supernatural, rasputin, s, ideas, and, strange, manners, made, him, the, subject, of, intense, curiosity, among, the, city, s, elite, who, according, to, fuhrmann, were, bored, cynical, and, seeking, new, experiences, during, this, period, rasputin, s, appeal, may, have, been, enhanced, by, the, fact, that, he, was, also, a, native, russian, unlike, other, self, described, holy, men, such, as, nizier, anthelme, philippe, and, g, rard, encausse, who, had, previously, been, popular, in, saint, petersburg, according, to, fuhrmann, rasputin, stayed, in, saint, petersburg, for, only, a, few, months, on, his, first, visit, and, returned, to, pokrovskoye, in, the, fall, of, 1903, smith, however, argues, that, it, is, impossible, to, know, whether, rasputin, stayed, in, saint, petersburg, or, returned, to, pokrovskoye, at, some, point, between, his, first, arrival, and, 1905, regardless, by, 1905, rasputin, had, formed, friendships, with, several, members, of, the, aristocracy, including, the, black, princesses, militsa, and, anastasia, of, montenegro, who, had, married, cousins, of, tsar, nicholas, ii, grand, duke, peter, nikolaevich, and, prince, george, maximilianovich, romanowsky, and, were, instrumental, in, introducing, rasputin, to, the, tsar, and, his, family, rasputin, first, met, nicholas, on, 1, november, 1905, at, the, peterhof, palace, the, tsar, recorded, the, event, in, his, diary, writing, that, he, and, his, empress, consort, alexandra, feodorovna, had, made, the, acquaintance, of, a, man, of, god, grigory, from, tobolsk, province, rasputin, returned, to, pokrovskoye, shortly, after, their, first, meeting, and, did, not, return, to, saint, petersburg, until, july, 1906, on, his, return, he, sent, nicholas, a, telegram, asking, to, present, the, tsar, with, an, icon, of, st, simeon, of, verkhoturye, he, met, with, nicholas, and, alexandra, on, 18, july, and, again, in, october, when, he, first, met, their, children, at, some, point, nicholas, and, alexandra, became, convinced, that, rasputin, possessed, the, miraculous, power, to, heal, their, only, son, tsesarevich, alexei, nikolaevich, who, suffered, from, haemophilia, historians, disagree, over, when, this, happened, according, to, orlando, figes, rasputin, was, first, introduced, to, the, tsar, and, tsarina, as, a, healer, who, could, help, their, son, in, november, 1905, while, joseph, t, fuhrmann, has, speculated, that, it, was, in, october, 1906, that, rasputin, was, first, asked, to, pray, for, the, health, of, alexei, much, of, rasputin, s, influence, with, the, imperial, family, stemmed, from, the, belief, by, alexandra, and, others, that, he, had, on, several, occasions, eased, alexei, s, pain, and, stopped, his, bleeding, according, to, historian, marc, ferro, the, tsarina, had, a, passionate, attachment, to, rasputin, believing, he, could, heal, her, son, s, affliction, harold, shukman, wrote, that, rasputin, became, an, indispensable, member, of, the, royal, entourage, it, is, unclear, when, rasputin, first, learned, of, alexei, s, haemophilia, or, when, he, first, acted, as, a, healer, he, may, have, been, aware, of, alexei, s, condition, as, early, as, october, 1906, and, was, summoned, by, alexandra, to, pray, for, the, tsarevich, when, he, had, an, internal, hemorrhage, in, the, spring, of, 1907, alexei, recovered, the, next, morning, alexandra, s, friend, anna, vyrubova, became, convinced, that, rasputin, had, miraculous, powers, shortly, thereafter, and, became, one, of, his, most, influential, advocates, during, the, summer, of, 1912, alexei, developed, a, hemorrhage, in, his, thigh, and, groin, after, a, jolting, carriage, ride, near, the, imperial, hunting, grounds, at, spa, a, which, caused, a, large, hematoma, in, severe, pain, and, delirious, with, fever, the, tsarevich, appeared, close, to, death, in, desperation, alexandra, asked, vyrubova, to, send, rasputin, who, was, in, siberia, a, telegram, asking, him, to, pray, for, alexei, rasputin, wrote, back, quickly, telling, the, tsarina, that, god, has, seen, your, tears, and, heard, your, prayers, do, not, grieve, the, little, one, will, not, die, do, not, allow, the, doctors, to, bother, him, too, much, the, next, morning, alexei, s, condition, was, unchanged, but, alexandra, was, encouraged, by, the, message, and, regained, some, hope, that, he, would, survive, his, bleeding, stopped, the, following, day, dr, s, p, fedorov, one, of, the, physicians, who, attended, alexei, admitted, that, the, recovery, was, wholly, inexplicable, from, a, medical, point, of, view, later, dr, fedorov, admitted, that, alexandra, could, not, be, blamed, for, seeing, rasputin, as, a, miracle, man, rasputin, would, come, in, walk, up, to, the, patient, look, at, him, and, spit, the, bleeding, would, stop, in, no, time, how, could, the, empress, not, trust, rasputin, after, that, historian, robert, k, massie, has, called, alexei, s, recovery, one, of, the, most, mysterious, episodes, of, the, whole, rasputin, legend, the, cause, of, his, recovery, is, unclear, massie, speculated, that, rasputin, s, suggestion, not, to, let, doctors, disturb, alexei, had, aided, his, recovery, by, allowing, him, to, rest, and, heal, or, that, his, message, may, have, aided, alexei, s, recovery, by, calming, his, mother, and, reducing, the, tsarevich, s, emotional, stress, alexandra, believed, that, rasputin, had, performed, a, miracle, and, concluded, that, he, was, essential, to, alexei, s, survival, some, writers, and, historians, such, as, ferro, claim, that, rasputin, stopped, alexei, s, bleeding, on, other, occasions, through, hypnosis, still, other, historians, including, memoirist, pierre, gilliard, alexei, s, french, language, tutor, have, speculated, that, rasputin, controlled, alexei, s, bleeding, by, disallowing, the, administration, of, aspirin, then, widely, used, to, relieve, pain, but, unknown, as, an, anti, clotting, agent, until, the, 1950s, alexei, and, his, siblings, were, also, taught, to, view, rasputin, as, our, friend, and, to, share, confidences, with, him, in, the, autumn, of, 1907, their, aunt, grand, duchess, olga, alexandrovna, was, escorted, to, the, nursery, by, nicholas, to, meet, rasputin, maria, her, sisters, and, brother, alexei, were, all, wearing, their, long, white, nightgowns, all, the, children, seemed, to, like, him, olga, alexandrovna, recalled, they, were, completely, at, ease, with, him, rasputin, s, friendship, with, the, tsar, s, children, was, evident, in, the, messages, he, sent, to, them, my, dear, pearl, m, rasputin, wrote, the, nine, year, old, maria, in, one, telegram, in, 1908, tell, me, how, you, talked, with, the, sea, with, nature, i, miss, your, simple, soul, we, will, see, each, other, soon, a, big, kiss, in, a, second, telegram, rasputin, told, the, child, my, dear, m, my, little, friend, may, the, lord, help, you, to, carry, your, cross, with, wisdom, and, joy, in, christ, this, world, is, like, the, day, look, it, s, already, evening, so, it, is, with, the, cares, of, the, world, in, february, 1909, rasputin, sent, all, of, the, children, a, telegram, advising, them, to, love, the, whole, of, god, s, nature, the, whole, of, his, creation, in, particular, this, earth, the, mother, of, god, was, always, occupied, with, flowers, and, needlework, one, of, the, girls, governesses, sofia, ivanovna, tyutcheva, was, horrified, in, 1910, when, rasputin, was, permitted, access, to, the, nursery, when, the, four, girls, were, in, their, nightgowns, tyutcheva, wanted, rasputin, barred, from, the, nurseries, in, response, to, her, complaints, nicholas, asked, rasputin, to, end, his, nursery, visits, i, am, so, afr, aid, that, s, i, can, speak, about, our, friend, something, bad, maria, s, twelve, year, old, sister, tatiana, wrote, to, her, mother, on, 8, march, 1910, after, begging, alexandra, to, forgive, her, for, doing, something, she, did, not, like, i, hope, our, nurse, will, be, nice, to, our, friend, now, alexandra, eventually, had, tyutcheva, fired, tyutcheva, took, her, story, to, other, members, of, the, imperial, family, who, were, scandalized, by, the, reports, though, rasputin, s, contacts, with, the, children, were, by, all, accounts, completely, innocent, nicholas, s, sister, grand, duchess, xenia, alexandrovna, was, horrified, by, tyutcheva, s, story, xenia, wrote, on, 15, march, 1910, that, she, could, not, understand, the, attitude, of, alix, and, the, children, to, that, sinister, grigory, whom, they, consider, to, be, almost, a, saint, when, in, fact, he, s, only, a, khlyst, he, s, always, there, goes, into, the, nursery, visits, olga, and, tatiana, while, they, are, getting, ready, for, bed, sits, there, talking, to, them, and, caressing, them, they, are, careful, to, hide, him, from, sofia, ivanovna, and, the, children, don, t, dare, talk, to, her, about, him,

vishnyakova, had, at, first, been, a, devotee, of, rasputin, but, later, was, disillusioned, by, him, alexandra, refused, to, believe, vishnyakova, and, said, that, everything, rasputin, does, is, holy, grand, duchess, olga, alexandrovna, was, told, that, vishnyakova, s, claim, had, been, immediately, investigated, but, they, caught, the, young, woman, in, bed, with, a, cossack, of, the,

rasputin, had, released, ardent, letters, written, to, him, by, the, tsarina, and, the, grand, duchesses, which, circulated, throughout, society, and, fueled, the, rumors, pornographic, cartoons, also, circulated, that, depicted, rasputin, having, sexual, relations, with, the, tsarina, with, her, four, daughters, and, anna, vyrubova, nude, in, the, background, nicholas, ordered, rasputin, to,

rasputin, continued, until, his, murder, on, 17, december, 1916, our, friend, is, so, contented, with, our, girlies, says, they, have, gone, through, heavy, courses, for, their, age, and, their, souls, have, much, developed, alexandra, wrote, to, nicholas, on, 6, december, 1916, in, his, memoirs, a, a, mordvinov, reported, that, the, four, grand, duchesses, appeared, cold, and, visibly, terribly, upset, by, rasputin, s, death, and, sat, huddled, up, closely, together, on, a, sofa, in, one, of, their, bedrooms, on, the, night, they, received, the, news, mordvinov, reported, that, the, young, women, were, in, a, gloomy, mood, and, seemed, to, sense, the, political, upheaval, that, was, about, to, be, unleashed, rasputin, was, buried, with, an, icon, signed, on, its, reverse, side, by, the, grand, duchesses, and, their, mother, the, imperial, family, s, belief, in, rasputin, s, healing, powers, brought, him, considerable, status, and, power, at, court, nicholas, appointed, rasputin, his, lampadnik, lamplighter, charged, with, keeping, the, lamps, lit, before, religious, icons, in, the, palace, which, gained, him, regular, access, to, the, palace, and, imperial, family, by, december, 1906, rasputin, had, become, close, enough, to, ask, a, special, favor, of, the, tsar, that, he, be, permitted, to, change, his, surname, to, rasputin, noviy, rasputin, new, nicholas, granted, the, request, and, the, name, change, was, speedily, processed, suggesting, that, rasputin, already, had, the, tsar, s, favor, at, that, early, date, rasputin, used, his, position, to, full, effect, accepting, bribes, and, sexual, favors, from, admirers, and, working, diligently, to, expand, his, influence, rasputin, soon, became, a, controversial, figure, he, was, accused, by, his, enemies, of, religious, heresy, and, rape, was, suspected, of, exerting, undue, political, influence, over, the, tsar, and, was, even, rumored, to, be, having, an, affair, with, the, tsarina,

launched, an, inquest, into, his, activities, accusing, him, of, spreading, false, khlyst, like, doctrines, in, saint, petersburg, rasputin, faced, opposition, from, even, more, prominent, critics, including, prime, minister, pyotr, stolypin, and, the, okhrana, the, tsar, s, secret, police, having, ordered, an, investigation, into, rasputin, s, activities, stolypin, confronted, nicholas, but,

that, rasputin, had, assaulted, female, followers, and, behaved, inappropriately, on, visits, with, the, imperial, family, and, particularly, with, nicholas, s, teenage, daughters, olga, and, tatiana, during, this, period, the, first, world, war, the, dissolution, of, feudalism, and, a, meddling, government, bureaucracy, all, contributed, to, russia, s, rapid, economic, decline, many, laid, the, blame, on, alexandra, and, rasputin, one, outspoken, member, of, the, duma, far, right, politician, vladimir, purishkevich, stated, in, november, 1916, that, he, held, the, tsar, s, ministers, had, been, turned, into, marionettes, marionettes, whose, threads, have, been, taken, firmly, in, hand, by, rasputin, and, the, empress, alexandra, fyodorovna, the, evil, genius, of, russia, and, the,

for, a, time, it, was, not, clear, if, he, would, survive, after, surgery, and, some, time, in, a, hospital, in, tyumen, he, recovered, guseva, was, a, follower, of, iliodor, a, former, priest, who, had, supported, rasputin, before, denouncing, his, sexual, escapades, and, self, aggrandizement, in, december, 1911, a, radical, conservative, and, anti, semite, iliodor, had, been, part, of, a, group, of, establishment, figures, who, had, attempted, to, drive, a, wedge, between, rasputin, and, the, imperial, family, in, 1911, when, this, effort, failed, iliodor, was, banished, from, saint, petersburg, and, was, ultimately, defrocked, guseva, claimed, to, have, acted, alone, having, read, about, rasputin, in, the, newspapers, and, believing, him, to, be, a, false, prophet, and, even, an, antichrist, both, the, police, and, rasputin, however, believed, that, iliodor, had, instigated, the, assassination, attempt, iliodor, fled, the, country, before, he, could, be, questioned, and, guseva, was, found, to, be, not, responsible, for, her, actions, by, reason, of, insanity, a, group, of, nobles, led, by, purishkevich, grand, duke, dmitri, pavlovich, and, prince, felix, yusupov, decided, that, rasputin, s, influence, over, alexandra, threatened, the, russian, empire, they, concocted, a, plan, in, december, 1916, to, kill, rasputin, apparently, by, luring, him, to, the, yusupovs, moika, palace, rasputin, was, murdered, during, the, early, morning, on, 30, december, 1916, at, the, home, of, prince, yusupov, he, died, of, three, gunshot, wounds, one, of, which, was, a, close, range, shot, to, his, forehead, little, is, certain, about, his, death, beyond, this, and, the, circumstances, of, his, death, have, been, the, subject, of, considerable, speculation, according, to, smith, what, really, happened, at, the, yusupov, home, on, 17, december, will, never, be, known, the, story, that, yusupov, recounted, in, his, memoirs, however, has, become, the, most, frequently, told, version, of, events, according, to, yusupov, s, account, rasputin, was, invited, to, his, palace, shortly, after, midnight, and, ushered, into, the, basement, yusupov, offered, tea, and, cakes, which, had, been, laced, with, cyanide, after, initially, refusing, the, cakes, rasputin, began, to, eat, them, and, to, yusupov, s, surprise, appeared, unaffected, by, the, poison, rasputin, then, asked, for, some, madeira, wine, which, had, also, been, poisoned, and, drank, three, glasses, but, still, showed, no, sign, of, distress, at, around, 2, 30, am, yusupov, excused, himself, to, go, upstairs, where, his, fellow, conspirators, were, waiting, he, took, a, revolver, from, pavlovich, then, returned, to, the, basement, and, told, rasputin, that, he, d, better, look, at, the, crucifix, and, say, a, prayer, referring, to, a, crucifix, in, the, room, then, shot, him, once, in, the, chest, the, conspirators, then, drove, to, rasputin, s, apartment, with, sukhotin, wearing, rasputin, s, coat, and, hat, in, an, attempt, to, make, it, look, as, though, rasputin, had, returned, home, that, night, upon, returning, to, his, palace, yusupov, went, back, to, the, basement, to, ensure, that, rasputin, was, dead, suddenly, rasputin, leaped, up, and, attacked, yusupov, who, freed, himself, with, some, effort, and, fled, upstairs, rasputin, followed, yusupov, into, the, palace, s, courtyard, where, he, was, shot, by, purishkevich, he, collapsed, into, a, snowbank, the, conspirators, then, wrapped, his, body, in, cloth, drove, it, to, the, petrovsky, bridge, and, dropped, it, into, the, little, nevka, river, in, an, unsubstantiated, claim, grand, duchess, tatiana, who, was, earlier, alleged, to, have, been, raped, by, rasputin, was, present, at, the, site, of, rasputin, s, murder, disguised, as, a, lieutenant, of, the, chevaliers, gardes, so, that, she, could, revenge, herself, on, rasputin, who, had, tried, to, violate, her, maurice, pal, ologue, the, french, ambassador, to, russia, wrote, that, tatiana, had, supposedly, witnessed, rasputin, s, castration, but, he, doubted, the, credibility, of, the, rumor, in, a, modern, analysis, of, rasputin, s, death, published, on, the, 100th, anniversary, of, the, event, dr, carolyn, harris, of, the, university, of, toronto, notes, that, the, actual, circumstances, were, apparently, less, dramatic, than, yusupov, s, account, rasputin, s, daughter, recorded, that, her, father, disliked, sweet, food, and, would, not, have, eaten, the, supposedly, poisoned, cakes, an, autopsy, account, by, the, official, surgeon, involved, has, no, record, of, poisoning, or, drowning, but, simply, records, death, by, a, single, bullet, fired, into, the, head, at, close, range, news, of, rasputin, s, murder, spread, quickly, even, before, his, body, was, found, according, to, smith, purishkevich, spoke, openly, about, the, murder, to, two, soldiers, and, to, a, policeman, who, was, investigating, reports, of, shots, shortly, after, the, event, but, urged, them, not, to, tell, anyone, else, an, investigation, was, launched, the, next, morning, the, stock, exchange, gazette, ran, a, report, of, rasputin, s, death, after, a, party, in, one, of, the, most, aristocratic, homes, in, the, center, of, the, city, on, the, afternoon, of, 30, december, 1916, after, two, workmen, discovered, blood, on, the, railing, of, the, petrovsky, bridge, and, a, boot, on, the, ice, below, police, began, searching, the, area, rasputin, s, body, was, found, under, the, river, ice, on, 1, january, o, s, 19, december, approximately, 200, meters, downstream, from, the, bridge, dmitry, kosorotov, the, city, s, senior, autopsy, surgeon, examined, the, body, kosorotov, s, report, was, lost, but, he, later, stated, that, rasputin, s, body, had, shown, signs, of, severe, trauma, including, three, gunshot, wounds, one, at, close, range, to, the, forehead, a, slice, wound, to, his, left, side, and, other, injuries, many, of, which, kosorotov, felt, had, been, sustained, post, mortem, kosorotov, found, a, single, bullet, in, rasputin, s, body, but, stated, that, it, was, too, badly, deformed, and, of, a, type, too, widely, used, to, trace, he, found, no, evidence, that, rasputin, had, been, poisoned, according, to, both, smith, and, fuhrmann, kosorotov, found, no, water, in, rasputin, s, lungs, and, reports, that, rasputin, had, been, thrown, into, the, water, alive, were, incorrect, some, later, accounts, claimed, that, rasputin, s, penis, had, been, severed, but, kosorotov, found, his,

later, that, day, the, imperial, family, planned, to, build, a, church, over, rasputin, s, grave, site, however, his, body, was, exhumed, and, burned, by, a, detachment, of, soldiers, on, the, orders, of, alexander, kerensky, shortly, after, nicholas, abdicated, the, throne, in, march, 1917, so, that, his, grave, would, not, become, a, rallying, point, for, supporters, of, the, old, regime,
