christopher, marlowe, m, r, l, o, mar, loh, baptised, 26, february, 1564, 30, may, 1593, also, known, as, kit, marlowe, was, an, english, playwright, poet, and, translator, of, the, elizabethan, era, marlowe, is, among, the, most, famous, of, the, elizabethan, playwrights, based, upon, the, many, imitations, of, his, play, tamburlaine, modern, scholars, consider, him, to, have, been, the, foremost, dramatist, in, london, in, the, years, just, before, his, mysterious, early, death, some, scholars, also, believe, that, he, greatly, influenced, william, shakespeare, who, was, baptised, in, the, same, year, as, marlowe, and, later, succeeded, him, as, the, preeminent, elizabethan, playwright, marlowe, was, the, first, to, achieve, critical, reputation, for, his, use, of, blank, verse, which, became, the, standard, for, the, era, his, plays, are, distinguished, by, their, overreaching, protagonists, themes, found, within, marlowe, s, literary, works, have, been, noted, as, humanistic, with, realistic, emotions, which, some, scholars, find, difficult, to, reconcile, with, marlowe, s, anti, intellectualism, and, his, catering, to, the, prurient, tastes, of, his, elizabethan, audiences, for, generous, displays, of, extreme, physical, violence, cruelty, and, bloodshed, events, in, marlowe, s, life, were, sometimes, as, extreme, as, those, found, in, his, plays, differing, sensational, reports, of, marlowe, s, death, in, 1593, abounded, after, the, event, and, are, contested, by, scholars, today, owing, to, a, lack, of, good, documentation, there, have, been, many, conjectures, as, to, the, nature, and, reason, for, his, death, including, a, vicious, bar, room, fight, blasphemous, libel, against, the, church, homosexual, intrigue, betrayal, by, another, playwright, and, espionage, from, the, highest, level, the, privy, council, of, elizabeth, i, an, official, coroner, s, account, of, marlowe, s, death, was, discovered, only, in, 1925, and, it, did, little, to, persuade, all, scholars, that, it, told, the, whole, story, nor, did, it, eliminate, the, uncertainties, present, in, his, biography, christopher, marlowe, the, second, of, nine, children, and, oldest, child, after, the, death, of, his, sister, mary, in, 1568, was, born, to, canterbury, shoemaker, john, marlowe, and, his, wife, katherine, daughter, of, william, arthur, of, dover, he, was, baptised, at, st, george, s, church, canterbury, on, 26, february, 1564, 1563, in, the, old, style, dates, in, use, at, the, time, which, placed, the, new, year, on, 25, march, marlowe, s, birth, was, likely, to, have, been, a, few, days, before, making, him, about, two, months, older, than, william, shakespeare, who, was, baptised, on, 26, april, 1564, in, stratford, upon, avon, by, age, 14, marlowe, was, a, pupil, at, the, king, s, school, canterbury, on, a, scholarship, and, two, years, later, a, student, at, corpus, christi, college, cambridge, where, he, also, studied, through, a, scholarship, with, expectation, that, he, would, become, an, anglican, clergyman, instead, he, received, his, bachelor, of, arts, degree, in, 1584, marlowe, mastered, latin, during, his, schooling, reading, and, translating, the, works, of, ovid, in, 1587, the, university, hesitated, to, award, his, master, of, arts, degree, because, of, a, rumour, that, he, intended, to, go, to, the, english, seminary, at, rheims, in, northern, france, presumably, to, prepare, for, ordination, as, a, roman, catholic, priest, if, true, such, an, action, on, his, part, would, have, been, a, direct, violation, of, royal, edict, issued, by, queen, elizabeth, i, in, 1585, criminalising, any, attempt, by, an, english, citizen, to, be, ordained, in, the, roman, catholic, church, large, scale, violence, between, protestants, and, catholics, on, the, european, continent, has, been, cited, by, scholars, as, the, impetus, for, the, protestant, english, queen, s, defensive, anti, catholic, laws, issued, from, 1581, until, her, death, in, 1603, despite, the, dire, implications, for, marlowe, his, degree, was, awarded, on, schedule, when, the, privy, council, intervened, on, his, behalf, commending, him, for, his, faithful, dealing, and, good, service, to, the, queen, the, nature, of, marlowe, s, service, was, not, specified, by, the, council, but, its, letter, to, the, cambridge, authorities, has, provoked, much, speculation, by, modern, scholars, notably, the, theory, that, marlowe, was, operating, as, a, secret, agent, for, privy, council, member, sir, francis, walsingham, the, only, surviving, evidence, of, the, privy, council, s, correspondence, is, found, in, their, minutes, the, letter, being, lost, there, is, no, mention, of, espionage, in, the, minutes, but, its, summation, of, the, lost, privy, council, letter, is, vague, in, meaning, stating, that, it, was, not, her, majesties, pleasure, that, persons, employed, as, marlowe, had, been, in, matters, touching, the, benefit, of, his, country, should, be, defamed, by, those, who, are, ignorant, in, th, affaires, he, went, about, scholars, agree, the, vague, wording, was, typically, used, to, protect, government, agents, but, they, continue, to, debate, what, the, matters, touching, the, benefit, of, his, country, actually, were, in, marlowe, s, case, and, how, they, affected, the, 23, year, old, writer, as, he, began, his, literary, career, in, 1587, little, is, known, about, marlowe, s, adult, life, all, available, evidence, other, than, what, can, be, deduced, from, his, literary, works, is, found, in, legal, records, and, other, official, documents, writers, of, fiction, and, non, fiction, have, speculated, about, his, professional, activities, private, life, and, character, marlowe, has, been, described, as, a, spy, a, brawler, and, a, heretic, as, well, as, a, magician, duellist, tobacco, user, counterfeiter, and, rakehell, while, j, a, downie, and, constance, kuriyama, have, argued, against, the, more, lurid, speculations, it, is, the, usually, circumspect, j, b, steane, who, remarked, it, seems, absurd, to, dismiss, all, of, these, elizabethan, rumours, and, accusations, as, the, marlowe, myth, much, has, been, written, on, his, brief, adult, life, including, speculation, of, his, involvement, in, royally, sanctioned, espionage, his, vocal, declaration, of, atheism, his, possibly, same, sex, sexual, interests, and, the, puzzling, circumstances, surrounding, his, death, marlowe, is, alleged, to, have, been, a, government, spy, park, honan, and, charles, nicholl, speculate, that, this, was, the, case, and, suggest, that, marlowe, s, recruitment, took, place, when, he, was, at, cambridge, in, 1587, when, the, privy, council, ordered, the, university, of, cambridge, to, award, marlowe, his, degree, as, master, of, arts, it, denied, rumours, that, he, intended, to, go, to, the, english, catholic, college, in, rheims, saying, instead, that, he, had, been, engaged, in, unspecified, affaires, on, matters, touching, the, benefit, of, his, country, surviving, college, records, from, the, period, also, indicate, that, in, the, academic, year, 1584, 1585, marlowe, had, had, a, series, of, unusually, lengthy, absences, from, the, university, which, violated, university, regulations, surviving, college, buttery, accounts, which, record, student, purchases, for, personal, provisions, show, that, marlowe, began, spending, lavishly, on, food, and, drink, during, the, periods, he, was, in, attendance, the, amount, was, more, than, he, could, have, afforded, on, his, known, scholarship, income, it, has, been, speculated, that, marlowe, was, the, morley, who, was, tutor, to, arbella, stuart, in, 1589, this, possibility, was, first, raised, in, a, times, literary, supplement, letter, by, e, st, john, brooks, in, 1937, in, a, letter, to, notes, and, queries, john, baker, has, added, that, only, marlowe, could, have, been, arbella, s, tutor, owing, to, the, absence, of, any, other, known, morley, from, the, period, with, an, ma, and, not, otherwise, occupied, if, marlowe, was, arbella, s, tutor, it, might, indicate, that, he, was, there, as, a, spy, since, arbella, niece, of, mary, queen, of, scots, and, cousin, of, james, vi, of, scotland, later, james, i, of, england, was, at, the, time, a, strong, candidate, for, the, succession, to, elizabeth, s, throne, frederick, s, boas, dismisses, the, possibility, of, this, identification, based, on, surviving, legal, records, which, document, marlowe, s, residence, in, london, between, september, and, december, 1589, marlowe, had, been, party, to, a, fatal, quarrel, involving, his, neighbours, and, the, poet, thomas, watson, in, norton, folgate, and, was, held, in, newgate, prison, for, a, fortnight, in, fact, the, quarrel, and, his, arrest, occurred, on, 18, september, he, was, released, on, bail, on, 1, october, and, he, had, to, attend, court, where, he, was, acquitted, on, 3, december, but, there, is, no, record, of, where, he, was, for, the, intervening, two, months, in, 1592, marlowe, was, arrested, in, the, english, garrison, town, of, flushing, vlissingen, in, the, netherlands, for, alleged, involvement, in, the, counterfeiting, of, coins, presumably, related, to, the, activities, of, seditious, catholics, he, was, sent, to, the, lord, treasurer, burghley, but, no, charge, or, imprisonment, resulted, this, arrest, may, have, disrupted, another, of, marlowe, s, spying, missions, perhaps, by, giving, the, resulting, coinage, to, the, catholic, cause, he, was, to, infiltrate, the, followers, of, the, active, catholic, plotter, william, stanley, and, report, back, to, burghley, marlowe, was, reputed, to, be, an, atheist, which, held, the, dangerous, implication, of, being, an, enemy, of, god, and, by, association, the, state, with, the, rise, of, public, fears, concerning, the, school, of, night, or, school, of, atheism, in, the, late, 16th, century, accusations, of, atheism, were, closely, associated, with, disloyalty, to, the, protestant, monarchy, of, england, some, modern, historians, consider, that, marlowe, s, professed, atheism, as, with, his, supposed, catholicism, may, have, been, no, more, than, a, sham, to, further, his, work, as, a, government, spy, contemporary, evidence, comes, from, marlowe, s, accuser, in, flushing, an, informer, called, richard, baines, the, governor, of, flushing, had, reported, that, each, of, the, men, had, of, malice, accused, the, other, of, instigating, the, counterfeiting, and, of, intending, to, go, over, to, the, catholic, enemy, such, an, action, was, considered, atheistic, by, the, church, of, england, following, marlowe, s, arrest, in, 1593, baines, submitted, to, the, authorities, a, note, containing, the, opinion, of, one, christopher, marly, concerning, his, damnable, judgment, of, religion, and, scorn, of, god, s, word, baines, attributes, to, marlowe, a, total, of, eighteen, items, which, scoff, at, the, pretensions, of, the, old, and, new, testament, such, as, christ, was, a, bastard, and, his, mother, dishonest, the, woman, of, samaria, and, her, sister, were, whores, and, that, christ, knew, them, dishonestly, st, john, the, evangelist, was, bedfellow, to, christ, and, leaned, always, in, his, bosom, cf, john, 13, 23, 25, and, that, he, used, him, as, the, sinners, of, sodom, he, also, implied, that, marlowe, had, catholic, sympathies, other, passages, are, merely, sceptical, in, tone, he, persuades, men, to, atheism, willing, them, not, to, be, afraid, of, bugbears, and, hobgoblins, the, final, paragraph, of, baines, s, document, reads, these, thinges, with, many, other, shall, by, good, honest, witnes, be, approved, to, be, his, opinions, and, comon, speeches, and, that, this, marlowe, doth, not, only, hould, them, himself, but, almost, into, every, company, he, cometh, he, persuades, men, to, atheism, willing, them, not, to, be, afeard, of, bugbeares, and, hobgoblins, and, vtterly, scorning, both, god, and, his, ministers, as, i, richard, baines, will, justify, approue, both, by, mine, oth, and, the, testimony, of, many, honest, men, and, almost, al, men, with, whome, he, hath, conversed, any, time, will, testify, the, same, and, as, i, think, all, men, in, cristianity, ought, to, indevor, that, the, mouth, of, so, dangerous, a, member, may, be, stopped, he, saith, likewise, that, he, hath, quoted, a, number, of, contrarieties, oute, of, the, scripture, which, he, hath, giuen, to, some, great, men, who, in, convenient, time, shalbe, named, when, these, thinges, shalbe, called, in, question, the, witnes, shalbe, produced, similar, examples, of, marlowe, s, statements, were, given, by, thomas, kyd, after, his, imprisonment, and, possible, torture, see, above, kyd, and, baines, connect, marlowe, with, mathematician, thomas, harriot, s, and, sir, walter, raleigh, s, circle, another, document, claimed, about, that, time, that, one, marlowe, is, able, to, show, more, sound, reasons, for, atheism, than, any, divine, in, england, is, able, to, give, to, prove, divinity, and, that, he, hath, read, the, atheist, lecture, to, sir, walter, raleigh, and, others, some, critics, believe, that, marlowe, sought, to, disseminate, these, views, in, his, work, and, that, he, identified, with, his, rebellious, and, iconoclastic, protagonists, plays, had, to, be, approved, by, the, master, of, the, revels, before, they, could, be, performed, and, the, censorship, of, publications, was, under, the, control, of, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, presumably, these, authorities, did, not, consider, any, of, marlowe, s, works, to, be, unacceptable, other, than, the, amores, it, has, been, claimed, that, marlowe, was, homosexual, some, scholars, argue, that, the, identification, of, an, elizabethan, as, gay, or, homosexual, in, the, modern, sense, is, anachronistic, saying, that, for, the, elizabethans, the, terms, were, more, likely, to, have, been, applied, to, homoerotic, affections, or, sexual, acts, rather, than, to, what, we, currently, understand, as, a, settled, sexual, orientation, or, personal, role, identity, other, scholars, argue, that, the, evidence, is, inconclusive, and, that, the, reports, of, marlowe, s, homosexuality, may, be, rumours, produced, after, his, death, richard, baines, reported, marlowe, as, saying, all, they, that, love, not, tobacco, boies, were, fools, david, bevington, and, eric, c, rasmussen, describe, baines, s, evidence, as, unreliable, testimony, and, hese, and, other, testimonials, need, to, be, discounted, for, their, exaggeration, and, for, their, having, been, produced, under, legal, circumstances, we, would, now, regard, as, a, witch, hunt, literary, scholar, j, b, steane, considered, there, to, be, no, evidence, for, marlowe, s, homosexuality, at, all, other, scholars, point, to, the, frequency, with, which, marlowe, explores, homosexual, themes, in, his, writing, in, hero, and, leander, marlowe, writes, of, the, male, youth, leander, in, his, looks, were, all, that, men, desire, edward, the, second, contains, the, following, passage, enumerating, homosexual, relationships, the, mightiest, kings, have, had, their, minions, great, alexander, loved, hephaestion, the, conquering, hercules, for, hylas, wept, and, for, patroclus, stern, achilles, drooped, and, not, kings, only, but, the, wisest, men, the, roman, tully, loved, octavius, grave, socrates, wild, alcibiades, marlowe, wrote, the, only, play, about, the, life, of, edward, ii, up, to, his, time, taking, the, humanist, literary, discussion, of, male, sexuality, much, further, than, his, contemporaries, the, play, was, extremely, bold, dealing, with, a, star, crossed, love, story, between, edward, ii, and, piers, gaveston, though, it, was, a, common, practice, at, the, time, to, reveal, characters, as, homosexual, to, give, audiences, reason, to, suspect, them, as, culprits, in, a, crime, christopher, marlowe, s, edward, ii, is, portrayed, as, a, sympathetic, character, the, decision, to, start, the, play, dido, queen, of, carthage, with, a, homoerotic, scene, between, jupiter, and, ganymede, that, bears, no, connection, to, the, subsequent, plot, has, long, puzzled, scholars, in, early, may, 1593, several, bills, were, posted, about, london, threatening, the, protestant, refugees, from, france, and, the, netherlands, who, had, settled, in, the, city, one, of, these, the, dutch, church, libel, written, in, rhymed, iambic, pentameter, contained, allusions, to, several, of, marlowe, s, plays, and, was, signed, tamburlaine, on, 11, may, the, privy, council, ordered, the, arrest, of, those, responsible, for, the, libels, the, next, day, marlowe, s, colleague, thomas, kyd, was, arrested, his, lodgings, were, searched, and, a, three, page, fragment, of, a, heretical, tract, was, found, in, a, letter, to, sir, john, puckering, kyd, asserted, that, it, had, belonged, to, marlowe, with, whom, he, had, been, writing, in, one, chamber, some, two, years, earlier, in, a, second, letter, kyd, described, marlowe, as, blasphemous, disorderly, holding, treasonous, opinions, being, an, irreligious, reprobate, and, intemperate, of, a, cruel, hart, they, had, both, been, working, for, an, aristocratic, patron, probably, ferdinando, stanley, lord, strange, a, warrant, for, marlowe, s, arrest, was, issued, on, 18, may, when, the, privy, council, apparently, knew, that, he, might, be, found, staying, with, thomas, walsingham, whose, father, was, a, first, cousin, of, the, late, sir, francis, walsingham, elizabeth, s, principal, secretary, in, the, 1580s, and, a, man, more, deeply, involved, in, state, espionage, than, any, other, member, of, the, privy, council, marlowe, duly, presented, himself, on, 20, may, but, there, apparently, being, no, privy, council, meeting, on, that, day, was, instructed, to, give, his, daily, attendance, on, their, lordships, until, he, shall, be, licensed, to, the, contrary, on, wednesday, 30, may, marlowe, was, killed, various, accounts, of, marlowe, s, death, were, current, over, the, next, few, years, in, his, palladis, tamia, published, in, 1598, francis, meres, says, marlowe, was, stabbed, to, death, by, a, bawdy, serving, man, a, rival, of, his, in, his, lewd, love, as, punishment, for, his, epicurism, and, atheism, in, 1917, in, the, dictionary, of, national, biography, sir, sidney, lee, wrote, on, slender, evidence, that, marlowe, was, killed, in, a, drunken, fight, his, claim, was, not, much, at, variance, with, the, official, account, which, came, to, light, only, in, 1925, when, the, scholar, leslie, hotson, discovered, the, coroner, s, report, of, the, inquest, on, marlowe, s, death, held, two, days, later, on, friday, 1, june, 1593, by, the, coroner, of, the, queen, s, household, william, danby, marlowe, had, spent, all, day, in, a, house, in, deptford, owned, by, the, widow, eleanor, bull, with, three, men, ingram, frizer, nicholas, skeres, and, robert, poley, all, three, had, been, employed, by, one, or, other, of, the, walsinghams, skeres, and, poley, had, helped, snare, the, conspirators, in, the, babington, plot, and, frizer, was, a, servant, to, thomas, walsingham, probably, acting, as, a, financial, or, business, agent, as, he, was, for, walsingham, s, wife, audrey, a, few, years, later, these, witnesses, testified, that, frizer, and, marlowe, had, argued, over, payment, of, the, bill, now, famously, known, as, the, reckoning, exchanging, divers, malicious, words, while, frizer, was, sitting, at, a, table, between, the, other, two, and, marlowe, was, lying, behind, him, on, a, couch, marlowe, snatched, frizer, s, dagger, and, wounded, him, on, the, head, according, to, the, coroner, s, report, in, the, ensuing, struggle, marlowe, was, stabbed, above, the, right, eye, killing, him, instantly, the, jury, concluded, that, frizer, acted, in, self, defence, and, within, a, month, he, was, pardoned, marlowe, was, buried, in, an, unmarked, grave, in, the, churchyard, of, st, nicholas, deptford, immediately, after, the, inquest, on, 1, june, 1593, the, complete, text, of, the, inquest, report, was, published, by, leslie, hotson, in, his, book, the, death, of, christopher, marlowe, in, the, introduction, to, which, professor, george, lyman, kittredge, wrote, the, mystery, of, marlowe, s, death, heretofore, involved, in, a, cloud, of, contradictory, gossip, and, irresponsible, guess, work, is, now, cleared, up, for, good, and, all, on, the, authority, of, public, records, of, complete, authenticity, and, gratifying, fullness, however, this, confidence, proved, to, be, fairly, short, lived, hotson, had, considered, the, possibility, that, the, witnesses, had, concocted, a, lying, account, of, marlowe, s, behaviour, to, which, they, swore, at, the, inquest, and, with, which, they, deceived, the, jury, but, decided, against, that, scenario, others, began, to, suspect, that, this, theory, was, indeed, the, case, writing, to, the, times, literary, supplement, shortly, after, the, book, s, publication, eug, nie, de, kalb, disputed, that, the, struggle, and, outcome, as, described, were, even, possible, and, samuel, a, tannenbaum, insisted, the, following, year, that, such, a, wound, could, not, have, possibly, resulted, in, instant, death, as, had, been, claimed, even, marlowe, s, biographer, john, bakeless, acknowledged, that, some, scholars, have, been, inclined, to, question, the, truthfulness, of, the, coroner, s, report, there, is, something, queer, about, the, whole, episode, and, said, that, hotson, s, discovery, raises, almost, as, many, questions, as, it, answers, it, has, also, been, discovered, more, recently, that, the, apparent, absence, of, a, local, county, coroner, to, accompany, the, coroner, of, the, queen, s, household, would, if, noticed, have, made, the, inquest, null, and, void, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, doubting, the, truth, of, the, inquest, concerns, the, reliability, of, marlowe, s, companions, as, witnesses, as, an, agent, provocateur, for, the, late, sir, francis, walsingham, robert, poley, was, a, consummate, liar, the, very, genius, of, the, elizabethan, underworld, and, was, on, record, as, saying, i, will, swear, and, forswear, myself, rather, than, i, will, accuse, myself, to, do, me, any, harm, the, other, witness, nicholas, skeres, had, for, many, years, acted, as, a, confidence, trickster, drawing, young, men, into, the, clutches, of, people, involved, in, the, money, lending, racket, including, marlowe, s, apparent, killer, ingram, frizer, with, whom, he, was, engaged, in, such, a, swindle, despite, their, being, referred, to, as, generosi, gentlemen, in, the, inquest, report, the, witnesses, were, professional, liars, some, biographers, such, as, kuriyama, and, downie, take, the, inquest, to, be, a, true, account, of, what, occurred, but, in, trying, to, explain, what, really, happened, if, the, account, was, not, true, others, have, come, up, with, a, variety, of, murder, theories, since, there, are, only, written, documents, on, which, to, base, any, conclusions, and, since, it, is, probable, that, the, most, crucial, information, about, his, death, was, never, committed, to, paper, it, is, unlikely, that, the, full, circumstances, of, marlowe, s, death, will, ever, be, known, for, his, contemporaries, in, the, literary, world, marlowe, was, above, all, an, admired, and, influential, artist, within, weeks, of, his, death, george, peele, remembered, him, as, marley, the, muses, darling, michael, drayton, noted, that, he, had, in, him, those, brave, translunary, things, that, the, first, poets, had, and, ben, jonson, even, wrote, of, marlowe, s, mighty, line, thomas, nashe, wrote, warmly, of, his, friend, poor, deceased, kit, marlowe, as, did, the, publisher, edward, blount, in, his, dedication, of, hero, and, leander, to, sir, thomas, walsingham, among, the, few, contemporary, dramatists, to, say, anything, negative, about, marlowe, was, the, anonymous, author, of, the, cambridge, university, play, the, return, from, parnassus, 1598, who, wrote, pity, it, is, that, wit, so, ill, should, dwell, wit, lent, from, heaven, but, vices, sent, from, hell, the, most, famous, tribute, to, marlowe, was, paid, by, shakespeare, in, as, you, like, it, where, he, not, only, quotes, a, line, from, hero, and, leander, dead, shepherd, now, i, find, thy, saw, of, might, who, ever, lov, d, that, lov, d, not, at, first, sight, but, also, gives, to, the, clown, touchstone, the, words, when, a, man, s, verses, cannot, be, understood, nor, a, man, s, good, wit, seconded, with, the, forward, child, understanding, it, strikes, a, man, more, dead, than, a, great, reckoning, in, a, little, room, this, appears, to, be, a, reference, to,
