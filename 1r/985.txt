al, shafi, i, arabic, romanized, al, sh, fi, ipa, 767, 820, ce, was, a, sunni, muslim, scholar, jurist, traditionist, theologian, ascetic, and, eponym, of, the, shafi, i, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, he, is, known, to, be, the, first, to, write, a, book, upon, the, principles, of, islamic, jurisprudence, having, authored, one, of, the, earliest, work, on, the, subject, al, risala, his, legacy, and, teaching, on, the, matter, provided, it, with, a, systematic, form, thereby, fundamentally, influenc, the, succeeding, generations, which, are, under, his, direct, and, obvious, impact, and, begin, a, new, phase, of, the, development, of, legal, theory, being, born, in, gaza, palestine, to, the, banu, muttalib, clan, of, the, quraysh, tribe, he, was, relocated, at, the, age, of, two, and, raised, in, mecca, he, later, resided, in, medina, yemen, baghdad, in, iraq, and, egypt, and, also, served, as, a, judge, for, some, time, in, najran, the, biography, of, al, shafi, i, is, difficult, to, trace, it, was, said, dawud, al, zahiri, d, 884, ce, was, the, first, to, write, one, but, the, work, has, been, lost, the, oldest, surviving, biography, goes, back, to, ibn, abi, hatim, al, razi, d, 938, 939, ce, but, is, only, a, collection, of, anecdotes, some, of, them, fantastical, similarly, a, biographical, sketch, written, by, zakariyya, ibn, yahya, al, saji, was, later, reproduced, but, even, then, a, great, deal, of, legend, had, already, crept, into, the, story, of, al, shafi, i, s, life, the, first, real, biography, was, written, by, al, bayhaqi, d, 1065, 1066, ce, but, is, filled, with, what, a, modernist, eye, would, qualify, as, pious, legends, the, following, is, what, seems, to, be, a, sensible, reading, according, to, a, modern, reductionist, perspective, al, shafi, i, belonged, to, the, qurayshi, clan, of, banu, muttalib, which, was, the, sister, clan, of, the, banu, hashim, to, which, muhammad, and, the, abbasid, caliphs, belonged, this, lineage, may, have, given, him, prestige, arising, from, his, belonging, to, the, tribe, of, muhammad, and, his, great, grandfather, s, kinship, to, him, however, he, grew, up, in, poverty, in, spite, of, his, connections, to, the, highest, social, circles, he, was, born, in, palestine, jund, filastin, by, the, town, of, ashkelon, in, 767, 768, ce, 150, ah, his, father, died, in, sham, while, he, was, still, a, child, fearing, the, waste, of, his, sharif, lineage, his, mother, decided, to, move, to, mecca, when, he, was, about, two, years, old, furthermore, his, maternal, family, roots, were, from, yemen, and, there, were, more, members, of, his, family, in, mecca, where, his, mother, believed, he, would, better, be, taken, care, of, little, is, known, about, al, shafi, i, s, early, life, in, mecca, except, that, he, was, brought, up, in, poor, circumstances, and, that, from, his, youth, he, was, devoted, to, learning, an, account, states, that, his, mother, could, not, afford, to, buy, his, paper, so, he, would, write, his, lessons, on, bones, particularly, shoulder, bones, he, studied, under, muslim, ibn, khalid, al, zanji, the, then, judge, of, mecca, who, is, thus, considered, to, be, his, first, teacher, by, the, age, of, seven, al, shafi, i, had, memorised, the, quran, at, ten, he, had, committed, malik, ibn, anas, s, muwatta, to, heart, at, which, time, his, teacher, would, deputise, him, to, teach, in, his, absence, al, shafi, i, was, authorised, to, issue, rulings, at, the, age, of, fifteen, al, shafi, i, moved, to, medina, in, desire, for, further, legal, training, as, was, the, tradition, of, acquiring, knowledge, accounts, differ, on, the, age, in, which, he, set, out, to, medina, an, account, placed, his, age, at, thirteen, while, another, stated, that, he, was, in, his, twenties, there, he, was, taught, for, many, years, by, the, famous, malik, ibn, anas, who, was, impressed, with, his, memory, knowledge, and, intelligence, by, the, time, of, malik, s, death, in, 179, ah, 795, ce, al, shafi, i, had, already, gained, a, reputation, as, a, brilliant, jurist, even, though, he, would, later, disagree, with, some, of, the, views, of, malik, al, shafi, i, accorded, the, deepest, respect, to, him, by, always, referring, to, him, as, the, teacher, at, the, age, of, thirty, al, shafi, i, was, appointed, as, the, abbasid, governor, in, the, yemeni, city, of, najran, he, proved, to, be, a, just, administrator, but, soon, became, entangled, with, factional, jealousies, in, 803, ce, al, shafi, i, was, accused, of, aiding, the, alids, in, a, revolt, and, was, thus, summoned, in, chains, with, a, number, of, alids, to, the, caliph, harun, al, rashid, at, raqqa, whilst, other, conspirators, were, put, to, death, al, shafi, i, s, own, eloquent, defence, convinced, the, caliph, to, dismiss, the, charge, other, accounts, state, that, the, famous, hanafi, jurist, muhammad, al, shaybani, was, present, at, the, court, and, defended, al, shafi, i, as, a, well, known, student, of, the, sacred, law, what, was, certain, was, that, the, incident, brought, al, shafi, i, in, close, contact, with, al, shaybani, who, would, soon, become, his, teacher, it, was, also, postulated, that, this, incident, impelled, him, to, devote, the, rest, of, his, career, to, legal, studies, never, again, to, seek, government, service, al, shafi, i, traveled, to, baghdad, to, study, with, abu, hanifah, s, acolyte, al, shaybani, and, others, it, was, here, that, he, developed, his, first, school, influenced, by, the, teachings, of, both, abu, hanifah, and, malik, his, work, thus, became, known, as, al, madhhab, al, qadim, li, l, imam, al, shafi, i, or, the, old, school, of, al, shafi, i, it, was, here, that, al, shafi, i, actively, participated, in, legal, arguments, with, the, hanafi, jurists, strenuously, defending, the, maliki, school, of, thought, some, authorities, stress, the, difficulties, encountered, by, him, in, his, arguments, al, shafi, i, eventually, left, baghdad, for, mecca, in, 804, ce, possibly, because, of, complaints, by, hanafi, followers, to, al, shaybani, that, al, shafi, i, had, become, somewhat, critical, of, al, shaybani, s, position, during, their, disputes, as, a, result, al, shafi, i, reportedly, participated, in, a, debate, with, al, shaybani, over, their, differences, though, who, won, the, debate, is, disputed, in, mecca, al, shafi, i, began, to, lecture, at, the, sacred, mosque, leaving, a, deep, impression, on, many, students, of, jurisprudence, including, the, founder, of, the, hanbali, school, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, al, shafi, i, s, legal, reasoning, began, to, mature, as, he, started, to, appreciate, the, strength, in, the, legal, reasoning, of, the, hanafi, jurists, and, became, aware, of, the, weaknesses, inherent, in, both, the, maliki, and, hanafi, schools, of, thought, al, shafi, i, eventually, returned, to, baghdad, in, 810, ce, by, this, time, his, stature, as, a, jurist, had, grown, sufficiently, to, permit, him, to, establish, an, independent, line, of, legal, speculation, the, caliph, al, ma, mun, is, said, to, have, offered, al, shafi, i, a, position, as, a, judge, but, he, declined, the, offer, in, 814, ce, al, shafi, i, decided, to, leave, baghdad, for, egypt, the, precise, reasons, for, his, departure, from, iraq, are, uncertain, but, it, was, in, egypt, that, he, would, meet, another, tutor, al, sayyidah, nafisah, who, would, also, financially, support, his, studies, and, where, he, would, dictate, his, life, s, works, to, students, several, of, his, leading, disciples, would, write, down, what, al, shafi, i, said, who, would, then, have, them, read, it, back, aloud, so, that, corrections, could, be, made, al, shafi, i, biographers, all, agree, the, legacy, of, works, under, his, name, are, the, result, of, those, sessions, with, his, disciples, through, muhammad, s, grandson, hasan, ibn, ali, nafisah, was, a, descendant, of, muhammad, and, she, married, another, descendant, of, muhammad, ishaq, al, mu, tamin, ishaq, was, the, son, of, ja, far, al, sadiq, a, teacher, of, al, shafi, i, s, teachers, malik, ibn, anas, 121, as, well, as, abu, hanifah, thus, all, of, the, four, major, imams, of, sunni, jurisprudence, abu, hanifah, malik, his, student, al, shafi, i, and, his, student, ahmad, are, connected, to, ja, far, al, sadiq, who, was, from, the, household, of, muhammad, whether, directly, or, indirectly, at, least, one, authority, states, that, al, shafi, i, died, as, a, result, of, injuries, sustained, from, an, attack, by, supporters, of, a, maliki, follower, named, fityan, the, story, goes, that, al, shafi, i, triumphed, in, the, argument, over, fityan, who, being, intemperate, resorted, to, abuse, the, then, governor, of, egypt, with, whom, al, shafi, i, had, good, relations, ordered, fityan, punished, by, having, him, paraded, through, the, streets, of, the, city, carrying, a, plank, and, stating, the, reason, for, his, punishment, fityan, s, supporters, were, enraged, by, this, treatment, and, attacked, al, shafi, i, in, retaliation, after, one, of, his, lectures, causing, him, to, die, a, few, days, later, however, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, casts, doubt, on, this, story, claiming, it, is, not, from, a, reliable, source, al, shafi, i, was, also, known, to, have, suffered, from, a, painful, intestinal, illness, and, hemorrhoids, which, kept, him, frail, and, ailing, during, the, later, years, of, his, life, thus, the, precise, cause, of, his, death, is, unknown, al, shafi, i, died, at, the, age, of, 54, on, 20, january, 820, ce, 30, rajab, 204, ah, in, al, fustat, egypt, he, was, buried, in, the, vault, of, the, banu, abd, al, hakam, near, mokattam, the, dome, was, built, in, 1212, ce, 608, ah, by, the, ayyubid, sultan, al, kamil, al, shafi, i, s, mausoleum, remains, an, important, site, today, the, shafi, i, school, one, of, the, four, sunni, schools, of, islamic, jurisprudence, known, as, madhhabs, is, named, for, al, sh, fi, who, is, also, credited, setting, up, the, framework, of, islamic, jurisprudence, by, establishing, the, relative, importance, order, of, its, different, sources, as, follows, scholar, john, burton, goes, farther, crediting, al, shafi, i, not, just, with, establishing, the, science, of, fiqh, in, islam, but, its, importance, to, the, religion, where, his, contemporaries, and, their, predecessors, had, engaged, in, defining, islam, as, a, social, and, historical, phenomenon, shafi, i, sought, to, define, a, revealed, law, al, sh, fi, emphasised, the, final, authority, of, a, hadith, of, muhammad, so, that, even, the, qur, an, was, to, be, interpreted, in, the, light, of, traditions, i, e, hadith, and, not, vice, versa, while, traditionally, the, quran, is, considered, above, the, sunna, in, authority, al, shafi, i, forcefully, argued, that, the, sunna, stands, on, equal, footing, with, the, quran, according, to, scholar, daniel, brown, for, as, al, shafi, i, put, it, the, command, of, the, prophet, is, the, command, of, almighty, allah, the, focus, by, the, muslim, community, on, ahadith, of, muhammad, and, disinterest, in, ahadith, of, muhammad, s, companions, whose, ahadith, were, commonly, used, before, al, sh, fi, since, most, of, whom, survived, him, and, spread, his, teachings, after, his, death, is, thought, by, scholar, joseph, schacht, to, reflect, the, success, of, al, sh, fi, s, doctrine, al, sh, fi, influence, was, such, that, he, changed, the, use, of, the, term, sunnah, until, it, invariably, meant, only, the, sunnah, of, the, prophet, according, to, john, burton, this, was, his, principle, achievement, while, earlier, sunnah, had, been, used, to, refer, to, tribal, manners, and, customs, and, while, al, sh, fi, distinguished, between, the, non, authoritative, sunnah, of, the, muslims, that, was, followed, in, practice, and, the, sunnah, of, the, prophet, that, muslims, should, follow, sunnah, came, to, mean, the, sunnah, of, muhammad, in, the, islamic, sciences, burton, credits, him, with, the, imposition, of, a, formal, theoretical, distinction, between, the, sunnah, of, the, prophet, and, the, quran, especially, where, the, two, fundamental, sources, appeared, to, clash, al, shafi, i, was, part, of, those, early, traditionalist, theologians, who, strongly, opposed, mutazilism, and, criticised, the, speculative, theologians, for, abandoning, the, qur, an, and, sunnah, through, their, adoption, of, greek, philosophy, in, metaphysics, saladin, built, a, madrassah, and, a, shrine, on, the, site, of, his, tomb, saladin, s, brother, afdal, built, a, mausoleum, for, him, in, 1211, after, the, defeat, of, the, fatimids, it, remains, a, site, where, people, petition, for, justice, among, the, followers, of, imam, al, sh, fi, s, school, were, he, authored, more, than, 100, books, but, most, them, have, not, reached, us, the, extant, works, of, his, which, are, accessible, today, are, in, addition, to, this, al, shafi, i, was, an, eloquent, poet, who, composed, many, short, poems, aimed, at, addressing, morals, and, behaviour, the, most, famous, of, which, is, his, al, diwan, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, considered, al, shafi, i, as, the, imam, most, faithful, to, tradition, who, led, the, people, of, tradition, to, victory, against, the, exponents, of, ra, y, in, the, words, of, ibn, hanbal, at, no, time, was, there, anyone, of, importance, in, learning, who, erred, less, and, who, followed, more, closely, the, sunnah, of, the, prophet, than, al, shafi, i, shah, waliullah, dehlawi, an, 18th, century, sunni, islamic, scholar, stated, a, mujadid, appears, at, the, end, of, every, century, the, mujadid, of,
