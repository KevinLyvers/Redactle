she, founded, a, school, in, moscow, however, the, soviet, government, s, failure, to, follow, through, on, promises, to, support, her, work, caused, her, to, return, to, the, west, and, leave, the,

danger, breaking, with, convention, duncan, imagined, she, had, traced, dance, to, its, roots, as, a, sacred, art, she, developed, from, this, notion, a, style, of, free, and, natural, movements, inspired, by, the, classical, greek, arts, folk, dances, social, dances, nature, and, natural, forces, as, well, as, an, approach, to, the, new, american, athleticism, which, included, skipping, running, jumping, leaping, and, tossing, duncan, wrote, of, american, dancing, let, them, come, forth, with, great, strides, leaps, and, bounds, with, lifted, forehead, and, far, spread, arms, to, dance, her, focus, on, natural, movement, emphasized, steps, such, as, skipping, outside, of, codified, ballet, technique, duncan, also, cited, the, sea, as, an, early, inspiration, for, her, movement, and, she, believed, movement, originated, from, the, solar, plexus, duncan, placed, an, emphasis, on, evolutionary, dance, motion, insisting, that, each, movement, was, born, from, the, one, that, preceded, it, that, each, movement, gave, rise, to, the, next, and, so, on, in, organic, succession, it, is, this, philosophy, and, new, dance, technique, that, garnered, duncan, the, title, of, the, creator, of, modern, dance, duncan, s, philosophy, of, dance, moved, away, from, rigid, ballet, technique, and, towards, what, she, perceived, as, natural, movement, she, said, that, in, order, to, restore, dance, to, a, high, art, form, instead, of, merely, entertainment, she, strove, to, connect, emotions, and, movement, i, spent, long, days, and, nights, in, the, studio, seeking, that, dance, which, might, be, the, divine, expression, of, the, human, spirit, through, the, medium, of, the, body, s, movement, she, believed, dance, was, meant, to, encircle, all, that, life, had, to, offer, joy, and, sadness, duncan, took, inspiration, from, ancient, greece, and, combined, it, with, a, passion, for, freedom, of, movement, this, is, exemplified, in, her, revolutionary, costume, of, a, white, greek, tunic, and, bare, feet, inspired, by, greek, forms, her, tunics, also, allowed, a, freedom, of, movement, that, corseted, ballet, costumes, and, pointe, shoes, did, not, costumes,
