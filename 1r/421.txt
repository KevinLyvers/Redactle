and, compassionate, tribute, however, because, the, memoirs, revealed, wollstonecraft, s, affairs, and, her, illegitimate, child, they, were, seen, as, shocking, mary, godwin, read, these, memoirs, and, her, mother, s, books, and, was, brought, up, to, cherish, her, mother, s, memory, mary, s, earliest, years, were, happy, judging, from, the, letters, of, william, godwin, s, housekeeper, and,

publishing, firm, called, m, j, godwin, which, sold, children, s, books, as, well, as, stationery, maps, and, games, however, the, business, did, not, turn, a, profit, and, godwin, was, forced, to, borrow, substantial, sums, to, keep, it, going, he, continued, to, borrow, to, pay, off, earlier, loans, compounding, his, difficulties, by, 1809, godwin, s, business, was, close, to, failure, and, he, was, near, to, despair, godwin, was, saved, from, debtor, s, prison, by, philosophical, devotees, such, as, francis, place, who, lent, him, further, money, though, mary, godwin, received, little, formal, education, her, father, tutored, her, in, a, broad, range, of, subjects, he, often, took, the, children, on, educational, outings, and, they, had, access, to, his, library, and, to, the, many, intellectuals, who, visited, him, including, the, romantic, poet, samuel, taylor, coleridge, and, the, former, vice, president, of, the, united, states, aaron, burr, godwin, admitted, he, was, not, educating, the, children, according, to, mary, wollstonecraft, s, philosophy, as, outlined, in, works, such, as, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, 1792, but, mary, godwin, nonetheless, received, an, unusual, and, advanced, education, for, a, girl, of, the, time, she, had, a, governess, and, a, daily, tutor, and, read, many, of, her, father, s, children, s, books, on, roman, and, greek, history, in, manuscript, for, six, months, in, 1811, she, also, attended, a, boarding, school, in, ramsgate, her, father, described, her, at, age, 15, as, singularly, bold, somewhat, imperious, and, active, of, mind, her, desire, of, knowledge, is, great, and, her, perseverance, in, everything, she, undertakes, almost, invincible, in, june, 1812, mary, s, father, sent, her, to, stay, with, the, dissenting, family, of, the, radical, william, baxter, near, dundee, scotland, to, baxter, he, wrote, i, am, anxious, that, she, should, be, brought, up, like, a, philosopher, even, like, a, cynic, scholars, have, speculated, that, she, was, sent, away, for, her, health, to, remove, her, from, the, seamy, side, of, the, business, or, to, introduce, her, to, radical, politics, mary, godwin, revelled, in, the, spacious, surroundings, of, baxter, s, house, and, in, the, companionship, of, his, four, daughters, and, she, returned, north, in, the, summer, of, 1813, for, a, further, stay, of, 10, months, in, the, 1831, introduction, to, frankenstein, she, recalled, i, wrote, then, but, in, a, most, common, place, style, it, was, beneath, the, trees, of, the, grounds, belonging, to, our, house, or, on, the, bleak, sides, of, the, woodless, mountains, near, that, my, true, compositions, the, airy, flights, of, my, imagination, were, born, and, fostered, mary, godwin, may, have, first, met, the, radical, poet, philosopher, percy, bysshe, shelley, in, the, interval, between, her, two, stays, in, scotland, by, the, time, she, returned, home, for, a, second, time, on, 30, march, 1814, percy, shelley, had, become, estranged, from, his, wife, and, was, regularly, visiting, william, godwin, whom, he, had, agreed, to, bail, out, of, debt, percy, shelley, s, radicalism, particularly, his, economic, views, which, he, had, imbibed, from, william, godwin, s, political, justice, 1793, had, alienated, him, from, his, wealthy, aristocratic, family, they, wanted, him, to, follow, traditional, models, of, the, landed, aristocracy, and, he, wanted, to, donate, large, amounts, of, the, family, s, money, to, schemes, intended, to, help, the, disadvantaged, percy, shelley, therefore, had, difficulty, gaining, access, to, money, until, he, inherited, his, estate, because, his, family, did, not, want, him, wasting, it, on, projects, of, political, justice, after, several, months, of, promises, shelley, announced, that, he, either, could, not, or, would, not, pay, off, all, of, godwin, s, debts, godwin, was, angry, and, felt, betrayed, mary, and, percy, began, meeting, each, other, secretly, at, her, mother, mary, wollstonecraft, s, grave, in, the, churchyard, of, st, pancras, old, church, and, they, fell, in, love, she, was, 16, and, he, was, 21, on, 26, june, 1814, shelley, and, godwin, declared, their, love, for, one, another, as, shelley, announced, he, could, not, hide, his, ardent, passion, leading, her, in, a, sublime, and, rapturous, moment, to, say, she, felt, the, same, way, on, either, that, day, or, the, next, godwin, lost, her, virginity, to, shelley, which, tradition, claims, happened, in, the, churchyard, godwin, described, herself, as, attracted, to, shelley, s, wild, intellectual, unearthly, looks, to, mary, s, dismay, her, father, disapproved, and, tried, to, thwart, the, relationship, and, salvage, the, spotless, fame, of, his, daughter, at, about, the, same, time, mary, s, father, learned, of, shelley, s, inability, to, pay, off, the, father, s, debts, mary, who, later, wrote, of, my, excessive, and, romantic, attachment, to, my, father, was, confused, she, saw, percy, shelley, as, an, embodiment, of, her, parents, liberal, and, reformist, ideas, of, the, 1790s, particularly, godwin, s, view, that, marriage, was, a, repressive, monopoly, which, he, had, argued, in, his, 1793, edition, of, political, justice, but, later, retracted, on, 28, july, 1814, the, couple, eloped, and, secretly, left, for, france, taking, mary, s, stepsister, claire, clairmont, with, them, after, convincing, mary, jane, godwin, who, had, pursued, them, to, calais, that, they, did, not, wish, to, return, the, trio, travelled, to, paris, and, then, by, donkey, mule, carriage, and, foot, through, a, france, recently, ravaged, by, war, to, switzerland, it, was, acting, in, a, novel, being, an, incarnate, romance, mary, shelley, recalled, in, 1826, godwin, wrote, about, france, in, 1814, the, distress, of, the, inhabitants, whose, houses, had, been, burned, their, cattle, killed, and, all, their, wealth, destroyed, has, given, a, sting, to, my, detestation, of, war, as, they, travelled, mary, and, percy, read, works, by, mary, wollstonecraft, and, others, kept, a, joint, journal, and, continued, their, own, writing, at, lucerne, lack, of, money, forced, the, three, to, turn, back, they, travelled, down, the, rhine, and, by, land, to, the, dutch, port, of, maassluis, arriving, at, gravesend, kent, on, 13, september, 1814, the, situation, awaiting, mary, godwin, in, england, was, fraught, with, complications, some, of, which, she, had, not, foreseen, either, before, or, during, the, journey, she, had, become, pregnant, she, and, percy, now, found, themselves, penniless, and, to, mary, s, genuine, surprise, her, father, refused, to, have, anything, to, do, with, her, the, couple, moved, with, claire, into, lodgings, at, somers, town, and, later, nelson, square, they, maintained, their, intense, programme, of, reading, and, writing, and, entertained, percy, shelley, s, friends, such, as, thomas, jefferson, hogg, and, the, writer, thomas, love, peacock, percy, shelley, sometimes, left, home, for, short, periods, to, dodge, creditors, the, couple, s, distraught, letters, reveal, their, pain, at, these, separations, pregnant, and, often, ill, mary, godwin, had, to, cope, with, percy, s, joy, at, the, birth, of, his, son, by, harriet, shelley, in, late, 1814, and, his, constant, outings, with, claire, clairmont, shelley, and, clairmont, were, almost, certainly, lovers, which, caused, much, jealousy, on, godwin, s, part, shelley, greatly, offended, godwin, at, one, point, when, during, a, walk, in, the, french, countryside, he, suggested, that, they, both, take, the, plunge, into, a, stream, naked, this, offended, her, principles, she, was, partly, consoled, by, the, visits, of, hogg, whom, she, disliked, at, first, but, soon, considered, a, close, friend, percy, shelley, seems, to, have, wanted, mary, godwin, and, hogg, to, become, lovers, mary, did, not, dismiss, the, idea, since, in, principle, she, believed, in, free, love, in, practice, however, she, loved, only, percy, shelley, and, seems, to, have, ventured, no, further, than, flirting, with, hogg, on, 22, february, 1815, she, gave, birth, to, a, two, month, premature, baby, girl, who, was, not, expected, to, survive, on, 6, march, she, wrote, to, hogg, my, dearest, hogg, my, baby, is,

thing, he, had, put, together, i, saw, the, hideous, phantasm, of, a, man, stretched, out, and, then, on, the, working, of, some, powerful, engine, show, signs, of, life, and, stir, with, an, uneasy, half, vital, motion, frightful, must, it, be, for, supremely, frightful, would, be, the, effect, of, any, human, endeavour, to, mock, the, stupendous, mechanism, of, the, creator, of, the, world, she, began, writing, what, she, assumed, would, be, a, short, story, with, percy, shelley, s, encouragement, she, expanded, this, tale, into, her, first, novel, frankenstein, or, the, modern, prometheus, published, in, 1818, she, later, described, that, summer, in, switzerland, as, the, moment, when, i, first, stepped, out, from, childhood, into, life, the, story, of, the, writing, of, frankenstein,

after, the, initial, idea, by, lord, byron, that, they, each, write, a, ghost, story, while, her, husband, percy, encouraged, her, writing, the, extent, of, percy, s, contribution, to, the, novel, is, unknown, and, has, been, argued, over, by, readers, and, critics, mary, shelley, wrote, i, certainly, did, not, owe, the, suggestion, of, one, incident, nor, scarcely, of, one, train, of, feeling, to, my, husband, and, yet, but, for, his, incitement, it, would, never, have, taken, the, form, in, which, it, was, presented, to, the, world, she, wrote, that, the, preface, to, the, first, edition, was, percy, s, work, as, far, as, i, can, recollect, there, are, differences, in, the, 1818, 1823, and, 1831, editions, which, have, been, attributed, to, percy, s, editing, james, rieger, concluded, percy, s, assistance, at, every, point, in, the, book, s, manufacture, was, so, extensive, that, one, hardly, knows, whether, to, regard, him, as, editor, or, minor, collaborator, while, anne, k,

facsimile, edition, of, the, frankenstein, manuscripts, concluded, that, percy, s, contributions, to, the, book, were, no, more, than, what, most, publishers, editors, have, provided, new, or, old, authors, or, in, fact, what, colleagues, have, provided, to, each, other, after, reading, each, other, s, works, in, progress, writing, on, the, 200th, anniversary, of, frankenstein, literary, scholar, and, poet, fiona, sampson, asked, why, hasn, t, mary, shelley, gotten, the, respect, she, deserves, she, noted, that, in, recent, years, percy, s, corrections, visible, in, the, frankenstein, notebooks, held, at, the, bodleian, library, in, oxford, have, been, seized, on, as, evidence, that, he, must, have, at, least, co, authored, the, novel, in, fact, when, i, examined, the, notebooks, myself, i, realized, that, percy, did, rather, less, than, any, line, editor, working, in, publishing, today, sampson, published, her, findings, in, in, search, of, mary, shelley, 2018, one, of, many,

them, the, couple, devoted, their, time, to, writing, reading, learning, sightseeing, and, socialising, the, italian, adventure, was, however, blighted, for, mary, shelley, by, the, deaths, of, both, her, children, clara, in, september, 1818, in, venice, and, william, in, june, 1819, in, rome, these, losses, left, her, in, a, deep, depression, that, isolated, her, from, percy, shelley, who, wrote, in, his, notebook, my, dearest, mary, wherefore, hast, thou, gone, and, left, me, in, this, dreary, world, alone, thy, form, is, here, indeed, a, lovely, one, but, thou, art, fled, gone, down, a, dreary, road, that, leads, to, sorrow, s, most, obscure, abode, for, thine, own, sake, i, cannot, follow, thee, do, thou, return, for, mine, for, a, time, mary, shelley, found, comfort, only, in, her, writing, the, birth, of, her, fourth, child, percy, florence, on, 12, november, 1819, finally, lifted, her, spirits, though, she, nursed, the, memory, of, her, lost, children, till, the, end, of, her, life, italy, provided, the, shelleys, byron, and, other, exiles, with, political, freedom, unattainable, at, home, despite, its, associations, with, personal, loss, italy, became, for, mary, shelley, a, country, which, memory, painted, as, paradise, their, italian, years, were, a, time, of, intense, intellectual, and, creative, activity, for, both, shelleys, while, percy, composed, a, series, of, major, poems, mary, wrote, the, novel, matilda, the, historical, novel, valperga, and, the, plays, proserpine, and, midas, mary, wrote, valperga, to, help, alleviate, her, father, s, financial, difficulties, as, percy, refused, to, assist, him, further, she, was, often, physically, ill, however, and, prone, to, depressions, she, also, had, to, cope, with, percy, s, interest, in, other, women, such, as, sophia, stacey, emilia, viviani, and, jane, williams, since, mary, shelley, shared, his, belief, in, the, non, exclusivity, of, marriage, she, formed, emotional, ties, of, her, own, among, the, men, and, women, of, their, circle, she, became, particularly, fond, of, the, greek, revolutionary, prince, alexandros, mavrokordatos, and, of, jane, and, edward, williams, in, december, 1818, the, shelleys, travelled, south, with, claire, clairmont, and, their, servants, to, naples, where, they, stayed, for, three, months, receiving, only, one, visitor, a, physician, in, 1820, they, found, themselves, plagued, by, accusations, and, threats, from, paolo, and, elise, foggi, former, servants, whom, percy, shelley, had, dismissed, in, naples, shortly, after, the, foggis, had, married, the, pair, revealed, that, on, 27, february, 1819, in, naples, percy, shelley, had, registered, as, his, child, by, mary, shelley, a, two, month, old, baby, girl, named, elena, adelaide, shelley, the, foggis, also, claimed, that, claire, clairmont, was, the, baby, s, mother, biographers, have, offered, various, interpretations, of, these, events, that, percy, shelley, decided, to, adopt, a, local, child, that, the, baby, was, his, by, elise, claire, or, an, unknown, woman, or, that, she, was, elise, s, by, byron, mary, shelley, insisted, she, would, have, known, if, claire, had, been, pregnant, but, it, is, unclear, how, much, she, really, knew, the, events, in, naples, a, city, mary, shelley, later, called, a, paradise, inhabited, by, devils, remain, shrouded, in, mystery, the, only, certainty, is, that, she, herself, was, not, the, child, s, mother, elena, adelaide, shelley, died, in, naples, on, 9, june, 1820, after, leaving, naples, the, shelleys, settled, in, rome, the, city, where, her, husband, wrote, the, meanest, streets, were, strewed, with, truncated, columns, broken, capitals, and, sparkling, fragments, of, granite, or, porphyry, the, voice, of, dead, time, in, still, vibrations, is, breathed, from, these, dumb, things, animated, and, glorified, as, they, were, by, man, rome, inspired, her, to, begin, writing, the, unfinished, novel, valerius, the, reanimated, roman, where, the, eponymous, hero, resists, the, decay, of, rome, and, the, machinations, of, superstitious, catholicism, the, writing, of, her, novel, was, broken, off, when, her, son, william, died, of, malaria, shelley, bitterly, commented, that, she, had, come, to, italy, to, improve, her, husband, s, health, and, instead, the, italian, climate, had, just, killed, her, two, children, leading, her, to, write, may, you, my, dear, marianne, never, know, what, it, is, to, lose, two, only, and, lovely, children, in, one, year, to, watch, their, dying, moments, and, then, at, last, to, be, left, childless, and, forever, miserable, to, deal, with, her, grief, shelley, wrote, the, novella, the, fields, of, fancy, which, became, matilda, dealing, with, a, young, woman, whose, beauty, inspired, incestuous, love, in, her, father, who, ultimately, commits, suicide, to, stop, himself, from, acting, on, his, passion, for, his, daughter, while, she, spends, the, rest, of, her, life, full, of, despair, about, the, unnatural, love, i, had, inspired, the, novella, offered, a, feminist, critique, of, a, patriarchal, society, as, matilda, is, punished, in, the, afterlife, though, she, did, nothing, to, encourage, her, father, s, feelings, in, the, summer, of, 1822, a, pregnant, mary, moved, with, percy, claire, and, edward, and, jane, williams, to, the, isolated, villa, magni, at, the, sea, s, edge, near, the, hamlet, of, san, terenzo, in, the, bay, of, lerici, once, they, were, settled, in, percy, broke, the, evil, news, to, claire, that, her, daughter, allegra, had, died, of, typhus, in, a, convent, at, bagnacavallo, mary, shelley, was, distracted, and, unhappy, in, the, cramped, and, remote, villa, magni, which, she, came, to, regard, as, a, dungeon, on, 16, june, she, miscarried, losing, so, much, blood, that, she, nearly, died, rather, than, wait, for, a, doctor, percy, sat, her, in, a, bath, of, ice, to, stanch, the, bleeding, an, act, the, doctor, later, told, him, saved, her, life, all, was, not, well, between, the, couple, that, summer, however, and, percy, spent, more, time, with, jane, williams, than, with, his, depressed, and, debilitated, wife, much, of, the, short, poetry, shelley, wrote, at, san, terenzo, involved, jane, rather, than, mary, the, coast, offered, percy, shelley, and, edward, williams, the, chance, to, enjoy, their, perfect, plaything, for, the, summer, a, new, sailing, boat, the, boat, had, been, designed, by, daniel, roberts, and, an, admirer, of, byron, edward, trelawny, who, had, joined, the, party, in, january, 1822, on, 1, july, 1822, percy, shelley, edward, ellerker, williams, and, captain, daniel, roberts, sailed, south, down, the, coast, to, livorno, there, percy, shelley, discussed, with, byron, and, leigh, hunt, the, launch, of, a, radical, magazine, called, the, liberal, on, 8, july, he, and, edward, williams, set, out, on, the, return, journey, to, lerici, with, their, eighteen, year, old, boat, boy, charles, vivian, they, never, reached, their, destination, a, letter, arrived, at, villa, magni, from, hunt, to, percy, shelley, dated, 8, july, saying, pray, write, to, tell, us, how, you, got, home, for, they, say, you, had, bad, weather, after, you, sailed, monday, we, are, anxious, the, paper, fell, from, me, mary, told, a, friend, later, i, trembled, all, over, she, and, jane, williams, rushed, desperately, to, livorno, and, then, to, pisa, in, the, fading, hope, that, their, husbands, were, still, alive, ten, days, after, the, storm, three, bodies, washed, up, on, the, coast, near, viareggio, midway, between, livorno, and, lerici, trelawny, byron, and, hunt, cremated, percy, shelley, s, corpse, on, the, beach, at, viareggio, is, the, most, wonderful, work, to, have, been, written, at, twenty, years, of, age, that, i, ever, heard, of, you, are, now, five, and, twenty, and, most, fortunately, you, have, pursued, a, course, of, reading, and, cultivated, your, mind, in, a, manner, the, most, admirably, adapted, to, make, you, a, great, and, successful, author, if, you, cannot, be, independent, who, should, be, william, godwin, to, mary, shelley, after, her, husband, s, death, mary, shelley, lived, for, a, year, with, leigh, hunt, and, his, family, in, genoa, where, she, often, saw, byron, and, transcribed, his, poems, she, resolved, to, live, by, her, pen, and, for, her, son, but, her, financial, situation, was, precarious, on, 23, july, 1823, she, left, genoa, for, england, and, stayed, with, her, father, and, stepmother, in, the, strand, until, a, small, advance, from, her, father, in, law, enabled, her, to, lodge, nearby, sir, timothy, shelley, had, at, first, agreed, to, support, his, grandson, percy, florence, only, if, he, were, handed, over, to, an, appointed, guardian, mary, shelley, rejected, this, idea, instantly, she, managed, instead, to, wring, out, of, sir, timothy, a, limited, annual, allowance, which, she, had, to, repay, when, percy, florence, inherited, the, estate, but, to, the, end, of, his, days, he, refused, to, meet, her, in, person, and, dealt, with, her, only, through, lawyers, mary, shelley, busied, herself, with, editing, her, husband, s, poems, among, other, literary, endeavours, but, concern, for, her, son, restricted, her, options, sir, timothy, threatened, to, stop, the, allowance, if, any, biography, of, the, poet, were, published, in, 1826, percy, florence, became, the, legal, heir, of, the, shelley, estate, after, the, death, of, his, half, brother, charles, shelley, his, father, s, son, by, harriet, shelley, sir, timothy, raised, mary, s, allowance, from, 100, a, year, to, 250, but, remained, as, difficult, as, ever, mary, shelley, enjoyed, the, stimulating, society, of, william, godwin, s, circle, but, poverty, prevented, her, from, socialising, as, she, wished, she, also, felt, ostracised, by, those, who, like, sir, timothy, still, disapproved, of, her, relationship, with, percy, bysshe, shelley, in, the, summer, of, 1824, mary, shelley, moved, to, kentish, town, in, north, london, to, be, near, jane, williams, she, may, have, been, in, the, words, of, her, biographer, muriel, spark, a, little, in, love, with, jane, jane, later, disillusioned, her, by, gossiping, that, percy, had, preferred, her, to, mary, owing, to, mary, s, inadequacy, as, a, wife, at, around, this, time, mary, shelley, was, working, on, her, novel, the, last, man, 1826, and, she, assisted, a, series, of, friends, who, were, writing, memoirs, of, byron, and, percy, shelley, the, beginnings, of, her, attempts, to, immortalise, her, husband, she, also, met, the, american, actor, john, howard, payne, and, the, american, writer, washington, irving, who, intrigued, her, payne, fell, in, love, with, her, and, in, 1826, asked, her, to, marry, him, she, refused, saying, that, after, being, married, to, one, genius, she, could, only, marry, another, payne, accepted, the, rejection, and, tried, without, success, to, talk, his, friend, irving, into, proposing, himself, mary, shelley, was, aware, of, payne, s, plan, but, how, seriously, she, took, it, is, unclear, in, 1827, mary, shelley, was, party, to, a, scheme, that, enabled, her, friend, isabel, robinson, and, isabel, s, lover, mary, diana, dods, who, wrote, under, the, name, david, lyndsay, to, embark, on, a, life, together, in, france, as, husband, and, wife, with, the, help, of, payne, whom, she, kept, in, the, dark, about, the, details, mary, shelley, obtained, false, passports, for, the, couple, in, 1828, she, fell, ill, with, smallpox, while, visiting, them, in, paris, weeks, later, she, recovered, unscarred, but, without, her, youthful, beauty, during, the, period, 1827, 40, mary, shelley, was, busy, as, an, editor, and, writer, she, wrote, the, novels, the, fortunes, of, perkin, warbeck, 1830, lodore, 1835, and, falkner, 1837, she, contributed, five, volumes, of, lives, of, italian, spanish, portuguese, and, french, authors, to, dionysius, lardner, s, cabinet, cyclopaedia, she, also, wrote, stories, for, ladies, magazines, she, was, still, helping, to, support, her, father, and, they, looked, out, for, publishers, for, each, other, in, 1830, she, sold, the, copyright, for, a, new, edition, of, frankenstein, for, 60, to, henry, colburn, and, richard, bentley, for, their, new, standard, novels, series, after, her, father, s, death, in, 1836, at, the, age, of, eighty, she, began, assembling, his, letters, and, a, memoir, for, publication, as, he, had, requested, in, his, will, but, after, two, years, of, work, she, abandoned, the, project, throughout, this, period, she, also, championed, percy, shelley, s, poetry, promoting, its, publication, and, quoting, it, in, her, writing, by, 1837, percy, s, works, were, well, known, and, increasingly, admired, in, the, summer, of, 1838, edward, moxon, the, publisher, of, tennyson, and, the, son, in, law, of, charles, lamb, proposed, publishing, an, edition, of, the, collected, works, of, percy, shelley, mary, wanted, to, include, in, this, collection, an, unexpurgated, version, of, percy, shelley, s, epic, poem, queen, mab, moxon, wanted, to, leave, out, the, most, radical, passages, as, too, shocking, and, atheistical, but, mary, prevailed, thanks, to, harriet, de, boinville, who, agreed, to, mary, s, request, to, borrow, her, own, original, copy, gifted, by, percy, shelley, mary, was, paid, 500, to, edit, the, poetical, works, 1838, which, sir, timothy, insisted, should, not, include, a, biography, mary, found, a, way, to, tell, the, story, of, percy, s, life, nonetheless, she, included, extensive, biographical, notes, about, the, poems, shelley, continued, to, practise, her, mother, s, feminist, principles, by, extending, aid, to, women, of, whom, society, disapproved, for, instance, shelley, extended, financial, aid, to, mary, diana, dods, a, single, mother, and, illegitimate, herself, who, appears, to, have, been, a, lesbian, and, gave, her, the, new, identity, of, walter, sholto, douglas, husband, of, her, lover, isabel, robinson, shelley, also, assisted, georgiana, paul, a, woman, disallowed, for, by, her, husband, for, alleged, adultery, shelley, wrote, in, her, diary, about, her, assistance, to, the, latter, i, do, not, make, a, boast, i, do, not, say, aloud, behold, my, generosity, and, greatness, of, mind, for, in, truth, it, is, simple, justice, i, perform, and, so, i, am, still, reviled, for, being, worldly, mary, shelley, continued, to, treat, potential, romantic, partners, with, caution, in, 1828, she, met, and, flirted, with, the, french, writer, prosper, m, rim, e, but, her, one, surviving, letter, to, him, appears, to, be, a, deflection, of, his, declaration, of, love, she, was, delighted, when, her, old, friend, from, italy, edward, trelawny, returned, to, england, and, they, joked, about, marriage, in, their, letters, their, friendship, had, altered, however, following, her, refusal, to, cooperate, with, his, proposed, biography, of, percy, shelley, and, he, later, reacted, angrily, to, her, omission, of, the, atheistic, section, of, queen, mab, from, percy, shelley, s, poems, oblique, references, in, her, journals, from, the, early, 1830s, until, the, early, 1840s, suggest, that, mary, shelley, had, feelings, for, the, radical, politician, aubrey, beauclerk, who, may, have, disappointed, her, by, twice, marrying, others, mary, shelley, s, first, concern, during, these, years, was, the, welfare, of, percy, florence, she, honoured, her, late, husband, s, wish, that, his, son, attend, public, school, and, with, sir, timothy, s, grudging, help, had, him, educated, at, harrow, to, avoid, boarding, fees, she, moved, to, harrow, on, the, hill, herself, so, that, percy, could, attend, as, a, day, scholar, though, percy, went, on, to, trinity, college, cambridge, and, dabbled, in, politics, and, the, law, he, showed, no, sign, of, his, parents, gifts, in, 1840, and, 1842, mother, and, son, travelled, together, on, the, continent, journeys, that, mary, shelley, recorded, in, rambles, in, germany, and, italy, in, 1840, 1842, and, 1843, 1844, in, 1844, sir, timothy, shelley, finally, died, at, the, age, of, ninety, falling, from, the, stalk, like, an, overblown, flower, as, mary, put, it, for, the, first, time, she, and, her, son, were, financially, independent, though, the, estate, proved, less, valuable, than, they, had, hoped, in, the, mid, 1840s, mary, shelley, found, herself, the, target, of, three, separate, blackmailers, in, 1845, an, italian, political, exile, called, gatteschi, whom, she, had, met, in, paris, threatened, to, publish, letters, she, had, sent, him, a, friend, of, her, son, bribed, a, police, chief, into, seizing, gatteschi, s, papers, including, the, letters, which, were, then, destroyed, shortly, afterwards, mary, shelley, bought, some, letters, written, by, herself, and, percy, bysshe, shelley, from, a, man, calling, himself, g, byron, and, posing, as, the, illegitimate, son, of, the, late, lord, byron, also, in, 1845, percy, bysshe, shelley, s, cousin, thomas, medwin, approached, her, claiming, to, have, written, a, damaging, biography, of, percy, shelley, he, said, he, would, suppress, it, in, return, for, 250, but, mary, shelley, refused, in, 1848, percy, florence, married, jane, gibson, st, john, the, marriage, proved, a, happy, one, and, mary, shelley, and, jane, were, fond, of, each, other, mary, lived, with, her, son, and, daughter, in, law, at, field, place, sussex, the, shelleys, ancestral, home, and, at, chester, square, london, and, accompanied, them, on, travels, abroad, mary, shelley, s, last, years, were, blighted, by, illness, from, 1839, she, suffered, from, headaches, and, bouts, of, paralysis, in, parts, of, her, body, which, sometimes, prevented, her, from, reading, and, writing, on, 1, february, 1851, at, chester, square, she, died, at, the, age, of, fifty, three, from, what, her, physician, suspected, was, a, brain, tumour, according, to, jane, shelley, mary, shelley, had, asked, to, be, buried, with, her, mother, and, father, but, percy, and, jane, judging, the, graveyard, at, st, pancras, to, be, dreadful, chose, to, bury, her, instead, at, st, peter, s, church, bournemouth, near, their, new, home, at, boscombe, on, the, first, anniversary, of, mary, shelley, s, death, the, shelleys, opened, her, box, desk, inside, they, found, locks, of, her, dead, children, s, hair, a, notebook, she, had, shared, with, percy, bysshe, shelley, and, a, copy, of, his, poem, adona, s, with, one, page, folded, round, a, silk, parcel, containing, some, of, his, ashes, and, the, remains, of, his, heart, mary, shelley, lived, a, literary, life, her, father, encouraged, her, to, learn, to, write, by, composing, letters, and, her, favourite, occupation, as, a, child, was, writing, stories, unfortunately, all, of, mary, s, juvenilia, were, lost, when, she, ran, off, with, percy, in, 1814, and, none, of, her, surviving, manuscripts, can, be, definitively, dated, before, that, year, her, first, published, work, is, often, thought, to, have, been, mounseer, nongtongpaw, comic, verses, written, for, godwin, s, juvenile, library, when, she, was, ten, and, a, half, however, the, poem, is, attributed, to, another, writer, in, the, most, recent, authoritative, collection, of, her, works, percy, shelley, enthusiastically, encouraged, mary, shelley, s, writing, my, husband, was, from, the, first, very, anxious, that, i, should, prove, myself, worthy, of, my, parentage, and, enrol, myself, on, the, page, of, fame, he, was, forever, inciting, me, to, obtain, literary, reputation, certain, sections, of, mary, shelley, s, novels, are, often, interpreted, as, masked, rewritings, of, her, life, critics, have, pointed, to, the, recurrence, of, the, father, daughter, motif, in, particular, as, evidence, of, this, autobiographical, style, for, example, commentators, frequently, read, mathilda, 1820, autobiographically, identifying, the, three, central, characters, as, versions, of, mary, shelley, william, godwin, and, percy, shelley, mary, shelley, herself, confided, that, she, modelled, the, central, characters, of, the, last, man, on, her, italian, circle, lord, raymond, who, leaves, england, to, fight, for, the, greeks, and, dies, in, constantinople, is, based, on, lord, byron, and, the, utopian, adrian, earl, of, windsor, who, leads, his, followers, in, search, of, a, natural, paradise, and, dies, when, his, boat, sinks, in, a, storm, is, a, fictional, portrait, of, percy, bysshe, shelley, however, as, she, wrote, in, her, review, of, godwin, s, novel, cloudesley, 1830, she, did, not, believe, that, authors, were, merely, copying, from, our, own, hearts, william, godwin, regarded, his, daughter, s, characters, as, types, rather, than, portraits, from, real, life, some, modern, critics, such, as, patricia, clemit, and, jane, blumberg, have, taken, the, same, view, resisting, autobiographical, readings, of, mary, shelley, s, works, was, never, heard, of, more, even, her, name, perished, the, private, chronicles, from, which, the, foregoing, relation, has, been, collected, end, with, the, death, of, euthanasia, it, is, therefore, in, public, histories, alone, that, we, find, an, account, of, the, last, years, of, the, life, of, castruccio, from, mary, shelley, valperga, mary, shelley, employed, the, techniques, of, many, different, novelistic, genres, most, vividly, the, godwinian, novel, walter, scott, s, new, historical, novel, and, the, gothic, novel, the, godwinian, novel, made, popular, during, the, 1790s, with, works, such, as, godwin, s, caleb, williams, 1794, employed, a, rousseauvian, confessional, form, to, explore, the, contradictory, relations, between, the, self, and, society, and, frankenstein, exhibits, many, of, the, same, themes, and, literary, devices, as, godwin, s, novel, however, shelley, critiques, those, enlightenment, ideals, that, godwin, promotes, in, his, works, in, the, last, man, she, uses, the, philosophical, form, of, the, godwinian, novel, to, demonstrate, the, ultimate, meaninglessness, of, the, world, while, earlier, godwinian, novels, had, shown, how, rational, individuals, could, slowly, improve, society, the, last, man, and, frankenstein, demonstrate, the, individual, s, lack, of, control, over, history, shelley, uses, the, historical, novel, to, comment, on, gender, relations, for, example, valperga, is, a, feminist, version, of, scott, s, masculinist, genre, introducing, women, into, the, story, who, are, not, part, of, the, historical, record, shelley, uses, their, narratives, to, question, established, theological, and, political, institutions, shelley, sets, the, male, protagonist, s, compulsive, greed, for, conquest, in, opposition, to, a, female, alternative, reason, and, sensibility, in, perkin, warbeck, shelley, s, other, historical, novel, lady, gordon, stands, for, the, values, of, friendship, domesticity, and, equality, through, her, shelley, offers, a, feminine, alternative, to, the, masculine, power, politics, that, destroy, the, male, characters, the, novel, provides, a, more, inclusive, historical, narrative, to, challenge, the, one, which, usually, relates, only, masculine, events, with, the, rise, of, feminist, literary, criticism, in, the, 1970s, mary, shelley, s, works, particularly, frankenstein, began, to, attract, much, more, attention, from, scholars, feminist, and, psychoanalytic, critics, were, largely, responsible, for, the, recovery, from, neglect, of, shelley, as, a, writer, ellen, moers, was, one, of, the, first, to, claim, that, shelley, s, loss, of, a, baby, was, a, crucial, influence, on, the, writing, of, frankenstein, she, argues, that, the, novel, is, a, birth, myth, in, which, shelley, comes, to, terms, with, her, guilt, for, causing, her, mother, s, death, as, well, as, for, failing, as, a, parent, shelley, scholar, anne, k, mellor, suggests, that, from, a, feminist, viewpoint, it, is, a, story, about, what, happens, when, a, man, tries, to, have, a, baby, without, a, woman, is, profoundly, concerned, with, natural, as, opposed, to, unnatural, modes, of, production, and, reproduction, victor, frankenstein, s, failure, as, a, parent, in, the, novel, has, been, read, as, an, expression, of, the, anxieties, which, accompany, pregnancy, giving, birth, and, particularly, maternity, sandra, gilbert, and, susan, gubar, argue, in, their, seminal, book, the, madwoman, in, the, attic, 1979, that, in, frankenstein, in, particular, shelley, responded, to, the, masculine, literary, tradition, represented, by, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, in, their, interpretation, shelley, reaffirms, this, masculine, tradition, including, the, misogyny, inherent, in, it, but, at, the, same, time, conceal, fantasies, of, equality, that, occasionally, erupt, in, monstrous, images, of, rage, mary, poovey, reads, the, first, edition, of, frankenstein, as, part, of, a, larger, pattern, in, shelley, s, writing, which, begins, with, literary, self, assertion, and, ends, with, conventional, femininity, poovey, suggests, that, frankenstein, s, multiple, narratives, enable, shelley, to, split, her, artistic, persona, she, can, express, and, efface, herself, at, the, same, time, shelley, s, fear, of, self, assertion, is, reflected, in, the, fate, of, frankenstein, who, is, punished, for, his, egotism, by, losing, all, his, domestic, ties, feminist, critics, often, focus, on, how, authorship, itself, particularly, female, authorship, is, represented, in, and, through, shelley, s, novels, as, mellor, explains, shelley, uses, the, gothic, style, not, only, to, explore, repressed, female, sexual, desire, but, also, as, way, to, censor, her, own, speech, in, frankenstein, according, to, poovey, and, mellor, shelley, did, not, want, to, promote, her, own, authorial, persona, and, felt, deeply, inadequate, as, a, writer, and, this, shame, contributed, to, the, generation, of, her, fictional, images, of, abnormality, perversion, and, destruction, shelley, s, writings, focus, on, the, role, of, the, family, in, society, and, women, s, role, within, that, family, she, celebrates, the, feminine, affections, and, compassion, associated, with, the, family, and, suggests, that, civil, society, will, fail, without, them, shelley, was, profoundly, committed, to, an, ethic, of, cooperation, mutual, dependence, and, self, sacrifice, in, lodore, for, example, the, central, story, follows, the, fortunes, of, the, wife, and, daughter, of, the, title, character, lord, lodore, who, is, killed, in, a, duel, at, the, end, of, the, first, volume, leaving, a, trail, of, legal, financial, and, familial, obstacles, for, the, two, heroines, to, negotiate, the, novel, is, engaged, with, political, and, ideological, issues, particularly, the, education, and, social, role, of, women, it, dissects, a, patriarchal, culture, that, separated, the, sexes, and, pressured, women, into, dependence, on, men, in, the, view, of, shelley, scholar, betty, t, bennett, the, novel, proposes, egalitarian, educational, paradigms, for, women, and, men, which, would, bring, social, justice, as, well, as, the, spiritual, and, intellectual, means, by, which, to, meet, the, challenges, life, invariably, brings, however, falkner, is, the, only, one, of, mary, shelley, s, novels, in, which, the, heroine, s, agenda, triumphs, the, novel, s, resolution, proposes, that, when, female, values, triumph, over, violent, and, destructive, masculinity, men, will, be, freed, to, express, the, compassion, sympathy, and, generosity, of, their, better, natures, frankenstein, like, much, gothic, fiction, of, the, period, mixes, a, visceral, and, alienating, subject, matter, with, speculative, and, thought, provoking, themes, rather, than, focusing, on, the, twists, and, turns, of, the, plot, however, the, novel, foregrounds, the, mental, and, moral, struggles, of, the, protagonist, victor, frankenstein, and, shelley, imbues, the, text, with, her, own, brand, of, politicised, romanticism, one, that, criticised, the, individualism, and, egotism, of, traditional, romanticism, victor, frankenstein, is, like, satan, in, paradise, lost, and, prometheus, he, rebels, against, tradition, he, creates, life, and, he, shapes, his, own, destiny, these, traits, are, not, portrayed, positively, as, blumberg, writes, his, relentless, ambition, is, a, self, delusion, clothed, as, quest, for, truth, he, must, abandon, his, family, to, fulfill, his, ambition, mary, shelley, believed, in, the, enlightenment, idea, that, people, could, improve, society, through, the, responsible, exercise, of, political, power, but, she, feared, that, the, irresponsible, exercise, of, power, would, lead, to, chaos, in, practice, her, works, largely, criticise, the, way, 18th, century, thinkers, such, as, her, parents, believed, such, change, could, be, brought, about, the, creature, in, frankenstein, for, example, reads, books, associated, with, radical, ideals, but, the, education, he, gains, from, them, is, ultimately, useless, shelley, s, works, reveal, her, as, less, optimistic, than, godwin, and, wollstonecraft, she, lacks, faith, in, godwin, s, theory, that, humanity, could, eventually, be, perfected, as, literary, scholar, kari, lokke, writes, the, last, man, more, so, than, frankenstein, in, its, refusal, to, place, humanity, at, the, centre, of, the, universe, its, questioning, of, our, privileged, position, in, relation, to, nature, constitutes, a, profound, and, prophetic, challenge, to, western, humanism, specifically, mary, shelley, s, allusions, to, what, radicals, believed, was, a, failed, revolution, in, france, and, the, godwinian, wollstonecraftian, and, burkean, responses, to, it, challenge, enlightenment, faith, in, the, inevitability, of, progress, through, collective, efforts, as, in, frankenstein, shelley, offers, a, profoundly, disenchanted, commentary, on, the, age, of, revolution, which, ends, in, a, total, rejection, of, the, progressive, ideals, of, her, own, generation, not, only, does, she, reject, these, enlightenment, political, ideals, but, she, also, rejects, the, romantic, notion, that, the, poetic, or, literary, imagination, can, offer, an, alternative, there, is, a, new, scholarly, emphasis, on, shelley, as, a, lifelong, reformer, deeply, engaged, in, the, liberal, and, feminist, concerns, of, her, day, in, 1820, she, was, thrilled, by, the, liberal, uprising, in, spain, which, forced, the, king, to, grant, a, constitution, in, 1823, she, wrote, articles, for, leigh, hunt, s, periodical, the, liberal, and, played, an, active, role, in, the, formulation, of, its, outlook, she, was, delighted, when, the, whigs, came, back, to, power, in, 1830, and, at, the, prospect, of, the, reform, act, 1832, 2, 3, will, 4, c, 45, critics, have, until, recently, cited, lodore, and, falkner, as, evidence, of, increasing, conservatism, in, mary, shelley, s, later, works, in, 1984, mary, poovey, influentially, identified, the, retreat, of, mary, shelley, s, reformist, politics, into, the, separate, sphere, of, the, domestic, poovey, suggested, that, mary, shelley, wrote, falkner, to, resolve, her, conflicted, response, to, her, father, s, combination, of, libertarian, radicalism, and, stern, insistence, on, social, decorum, mellor, largely, agreed, arguing, that, mary, shelley, grounded, her, alternative, political, ideology, on, the, metaphor, of, the, peaceful, loving, bourgeois, family, she, thereby, implicitly, endorsed, a, conservative, vision, of, gradual, evolutionary, reform, this, vision, allowed, women, to, participate, in, the, public, sphere, but, it, inherited, the, inequalities, inherent, in, the, bourgeois, family, however, in, the, last, decade, or, so, this, view, has, been, challenged, for, example, bennett, claims, that, mary, shelley, s, works, reveal, a, consistent, commitment, to, romantic, idealism, and, political, reform, and, jane, blumberg, s, study, of, shelley, s, early, novels, argues, that, her, career, cannot, be, easily, divided, into, radical, and, conservative, halves, she, contends, that, shelley, was, never, a, passionate, radical, like, her, husband, and, her, later, lifestyle, was, not, abruptly, assumed, nor, was, it, a, betrayal, she, was, in, fact, challenging, the, political, and, literary, influences, of, her, circle, in, her, first, work, in, this, reading, shelley, s, early, works, are, interpreted, as, a, challenge, to, godwin, and, percy, bysshe, shelley, s, radicalism, victor, frankenstein, s, thoughtless, rejection, of, family, for, example, is, seen, as, evidence, of, shelley, s, constant, concern, for, the, domestic, in, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, mary, shelley, frequently, wrote, short, stories, for, gift, books, or, annuals, including, sixteen, for, the, keepsake, which, was, aimed, at, middle, class, women, and, bound, in, silk, with, gilt, edged, pages, mary, shelley, s, work, in, this, genre, has, been, described, as, that, of, a, hack, writer, and, wordy, and, pedestrian, however, critic, charlotte, sussman, points, out, that, other, leading, writers, of, the, day, such, as, the, romantic, poets, william, wordsworth, and, samuel, taylor, coleridge, also, took, advantage, of, this, profitable, market, she, explains, that, the, annuals, were, a, major, mode, of, literary, production, in, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, with, the, keepsake, the, most, successful, many, of, shelley, s, stories, are, set, in, places, or, times, far, removed, from, early, 19th, century, britain, such, as, greece, and, the, reign, of, henry, iv, of, france, shelley, was, particularly, interested, in, the, fragility, of, individual, identity, and, often, depicted, the, way, a, person, s, role, in, the, world, can, be, cataclysmically, altered, either, by, an, internal, emotional, upheaval, or, by, some, supernatural, occurrence, that, mirrors, an, internal, schism, in, her, stories, female, identity, is, tied, to, a, woman, s, short, lived, value, in, the, marriage, market, while, male, identity, can, be, sustained, and, transformed, through, the, use, of, money, although, mary, shelley, wrote, twenty, one, short, stories, for, the, annuals, between, 1823, and, 1839, she, always, saw, herself, above, all, as, a, novelist, she, wrote, to, leigh, hunt, i, write, bad, articles, which, help, to, make, me, miserable, but, i, am, going, to, plunge, into, a, novel, and, hope, that, its, clear, water, will, wash, off, the, mud, of, the, magazines, when, they, ran, off, to, france, in, the, summer, of, 1814, mary, godwin, and, percy, shelley, began, a, joint, journal, which, they, published, in, 1817, under, the, title, history, of, a, six, weeks, tour, adding, four, letters, two, by, each, of, them, based, on, their, visit, to, geneva, in, 1816, along, with, percy, shelley, s, poem, mont, blanc, the, work, celebrates, youthful, love, and, political, idealism, and, consciously, follows, the, example, of, mary, wollstonecraft, and, others, who, had, combined, travelling, with, writing, the, perspective, of, the, history, is, philosophical, and, reformist, rather, than, that, of, a, conventional, travelogue, in, particular, it, addresses, the, effects, of, politics, and, war, on, france, the, letters, the, couple, wrote, on, the, second, journey, confront, the, great, and, extraordinary, events, of, the, final, defeat, of, napoleon, at, waterloo, after, his, hundred, days, return, in, 1815, they, also, explore, the, sublimity, of, lake, geneva, and, mont, blanc, as, well, as, the, revolutionary, legacy, of, the, philosopher, and, novelist, jean, jacques, rousseau, mary, shelley, s, last, full, length, book, written, in, the, form, of, letters, and, published, in, 1844, was, rambles, in, germany, and, italy, in, 1840, 1842, and, 1843, which, recorded, her, travels, with, her, son, percy, florence, and, his, university, friends, in, rambles, shelley, follows, the, tradition, of, mary, wollstonecraft, s, letters, written, in, sweden, norway, and, denmark, and, her, own, a, history, of, a, six, weeks, tour, in, mapping, her, personal, and, political, landscape, through, the, discourse, of, sensibility, and, sympathy, for, shelley, building, sympathetic, connections, between, people, is, the, way, to, build, civil, society, and, to, increase, knowledge, knowledge, to, enlighten, and, free, the, mind, from, clinging, deadening, prejudices, a, wider, circle, of, sympathy, with, our, fellow, creatures, these, are, the, uses, of, travel, between, observations, on, scenery, culture, and, the, people, especially, in, a, political, point, of, view, she, uses, the, travelogue, form, to, explore, her, roles, as, a, widow, and, mother, and, to, reflect, on, revolutionary, nationalism, in, italy, she, also, records, her, pilgrimage, to, scenes, associated, with, percy, shelley, according, to, critic, clarissa, orr, mary, shelley, s, adoption, of, a, persona, of, philosophical, motherhood, gives, rambles, the, unity, of, a, prose, poem, with, death, and, memory, as, central, themes, at, the, same, time, shelley, makes, an, egalitarian, case, against, monarchy, class, distinctions, slavery, and, war, between, 1832, and, 1839, mary, shelley, wrote, many, biographies, of, notable, italian, spanish, portuguese, and, french, men, and, a, few, women, for, dionysius, lardner, s, lives, of, the, most, eminent, literary, and, scientific, men, these, formed, part, of, lardner, s, cabinet, cyclopaedia, one, of, the, best, of, many, such, series, produced, in, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, in, response, to, growing, middle, class, demand, for, self, education, until, the, republication, of, these, essays, in, 2002, their, significance, within, her, body, of, work, was, not, appreciated, in, the, view, of, literary, scholar, greg, kucich, they, reveal, mary, shelley, s, prodigious, research, across, several, centuries, and, in, multiple, languages, her, gift, for, biographical, narrative, and, her, interest, in, the, emerging, forms, of, feminist, historiography, shelley, wrote, in, a, biographical, style, popularised, by, the, 18th, century, critic, samuel, johnson, in, his, lives, of, the, poets, 1779, 1781, combining, secondary, sources, memoir, and, anecdote, and, authorial, evaluation, she, records, details, of, each, writer, s, life, and, character, quotes, their, writing, in, the, original, as, well, as, in, translation, and, ends, with, a, critical, assessment, of, their, achievement, for, shelley, biographical, writing, was, supposed, to, in, her, words, form, as, it, were, a, school, in, which, to, study, the, philosophy, of, history, and, to, teach, lessons, most, frequently, and, importantly, these, lessons, consisted, of, criticisms, of, male, dominated, institutions, such, as, primogeniture, shelley, emphasises, domesticity, romance, family, sympathy, and, compassion, in, the, lives, of, her, subjects, her, conviction, that, such, forces, could, improve, society, connects, her, biographical, approach, with, that, of, other, early, feminist, historians, such, as, mary, hays, and, anna, jameson, unlike, her, novels, most, of, which, had, an, original, print, run, of, several, hundred, copies, the, lives, had, a, print, run, of, about, 4, 000, for, each, volume, thus, according, to, kucich, mary, shelley, s, use, of, biography, to, forward, the, social, agenda, of, women, s, historiography, became, one, of, her, most, influential, political, interventions, the, qualities, that, struck, anyone, newly, introduced, to, shelley, were, first, a, gentle, and, cordial, goodness, that, animated, his, intercourse, with, warm, affection, and, helpful, sympathy, the, other, the, eagerness, and, ardour, with, which, he, was, attached, to, the, cause, of, human, happiness, and, improvement, mary, shelley, preface, poetical, works, of, percy, bysshe, shelley, soon, after, percy, shelley, s, death, mary, shelley, determined, to, write, his, biography, in, a, letter, of, 17, november, 1822, she, announced, i, shall, write, his, life, thus, occupy, myself, in, the, only, manner, from, which, i, can, derive, consolation, however, her, father, in, law, sir, timothy, shelley, effectively, banned, her, from, doing, so, mary, began, her, fostering, of, percy, s, poetic, reputation, in, 1824, with, the, publication, of, his, posthumous, poems, in, 1839, while, she, was, working, on, the, lives, she, prepared, a, new, edition, of, his, poetry, which, became, in, the, words, of, literary, scholar, susan, j, wolfson, the, canonizing, event, in, the, history, of, her, husband, s, reputation, the, following, year, mary, shelley, edited, a, volume, of, her, husband, s, essays, letters, translations, and, fragments, and, throughout, the, 1830s, she, introduced, his, poetry, to, a, wider, audience, by, publishing, assorted, works, in, the, annual, the, keepsake, evading, sir, timothy, s, ban, on, a, biography, mary, shelley, often, included, in, these, editions, her, own, annotations, and, reflections, on, her, husband, s, life, and, work, i, am, to, justify, his, ways, she, had, declared, in, 1824, i, am, to, make, him, beloved, to, all, posterity, it, was, this, goal, argues, blumberg, that, led, her, to, present, percy, s, work, to, the, public, in, the, most, popular, form, possible, to, tailor, his, works, for, a, victorian, audience, she, cast, percy, shelley, as, a, lyrical, rather, than, a, political, poet, as, mary, favret, writes, the, disembodied, percy, identifies, the, spirit, of, poetry, itself, mary, glossed, percy, s, political, radicalism, as, a, form, of, sentimentalism, arguing, that, his, republicanism, arose, from, sympathy, for, those, who, were, suffering, she, inserted, romantic, anecdotes, of, his, benevolence, domesticity, and, love, of, the, natural, world, portraying, herself, as, percy, s, practical, muse, she, also, noted, how, she, had, suggested, revisions, as, he, wrote, despite, the, emotions, stirred, by, this, task, mary, shelley, arguably, proved, herself, in, many, respects, a, professional, and, scholarly, editor, working, from, percy, s, messy, sometimes, indecipherable, notebooks, she, attempted, to, form, a, chronology, for, his, writings, and, she, included, poems, such, as, epipsychidion, addressed, to, emilia, viviani, which, she, would, rather, have, left, out, she, was, forced, however, into, several, compromises, and, as, blumberg, notes, modern, critics, have, found, fault, with, the, edition, and, claim, variously, that, she, miscopied, misinterpreted, purposely, obscured, and, attempted, to, turn, the, poet, into, something, he, was, not, according, to, wolfson, donald, reiman, a, modern, editor, of, percy, bysshe, shelley, s, works, still, refers, to, mary, shelley, s, editions, while, acknowledging, that, her, editing, style, belongs, to, an, age, of, editing, when, the, aim, was, not, to, establish, accurate, texts, and, scholarly, apparatus, but, to, present, a, full, record, of, a, writer, s, career, for, the, general, reader, in, principle, mary, shelley, believed, in, publishing, every, last, word, of, her, husband, s, work, but, she, found, herself, obliged, to, omit, certain, passages, either, by, pressure, from, her, publisher, edward, moxon, or, in, deference, to, public, propriety, for, example, she, removed, the, atheistic, passages, from, queen, mab, for, the, first, edition, after, she, restored, them, in, the, second, edition, moxon, was, prosecuted, and, convicted, of, blasphemous, libel, though, the, prosecution, was, brought, out, of, principle, by, the, chartist, publisher, henry, hetherington, and, no, punishment, was, sought, mary, shelley, s, omissions, provoked, criticism, often, stinging, from, members, of, percy, shelley, s, former, circle, and, reviewers, accused, her, of, among, other, things, indiscriminate, inclusions, her, notes, have, nevertheless, remained, an, essential, source, for, the, study, of, percy, shelley, s, work, as, bennett, explains, biographers, and, critics, agree, that, mary, shelley, s, commitment, to, bring, shelley, the, notice, she, believed, his, works, merited, was, the, single, major, force, that, established, shelley, s, reputation, during, a, period, when, he, almost, certainly, would, have, faded, from, public, view, in, her, own, lifetime, mary, shelley, was, taken, seriously, as, a, writer, though, reviewers, often, missed, her, writings, political, edge, after, her, death, however, she, was, chiefly, remembered, as, the, wife, of, percy, bysshe, shelley, and, as, the, author, of, frankenstein, in, fact, in, the, introduction, to, her, letters, published, in, 1945, editor, frederick, jones, wrote, a, collection, of, the, present, size, could, not, be, justified, by, the, general, quality, of, the, letters, or, by, mary, shelley, s, importance, as, a, writer, it, is, as, the, wife, of, that, she, excites, our, interest, this, attitude, had, not, disappeared, by, 1980, when, betty, t, bennett, published, the, first, volume, of, mary, shelley, s, complete, letters, as, she, explains, the, fact, is, that, until, recent, years, scholars, have, generally, regarded, mary, wollstonecraft, shelley, as, a, result, william, godwin, s, and, mary, wollstonecraft, s, daughter, who, became, shelley, s, pygmalion, it, was, not, until, emily, sunstein, s, mary, shelley, romance, and, reality, in, 1989, that, a, full, length, scholarly, biography, was, published, the, attempts, of, mary, shelley, s, son, and, daughter, in, law, to, victorianise, her, memory, by, censoring, biographical, documents, contributed, to, a, perception, of, mary, shelley, as, a, more, conventional, less, reformist, figure, than, her, works, suggest, her, own, timid, omissions, from, percy, shelley, s, works, and, her, quiet, avoidance, of, public, controversy, in, her, later, years, added, to, this, impression, commentary, by, hogg, trelawny, and, other, admirers, of, percy, shelley, also, tended, to, downplay, mary, shelley, s, radicalism, trelawny, s, records, of, shelley, byron, and, the, author, 1878, praised, percy, shelley, at, the, expense, of, mary, questioning, her, intelligence, and, even, her, authorship, of, frankenstein, lady, shelley, percy, florence, s, wife, responded, in, part, by, presenting, a, severely, edited, collection, of, letters, she, had, inherited, published, privately, as, shelley, and, mary, in, 1882, from, frankenstein, s, first, theatrical, adaptation, in, 1823, to, the, cinematic, adaptations, of, the, 20th, century, including, the, first, cinematic, version, in, 1910, and, now, famous, versions, such, as, james, whale, s, 1931, frankenstein, mel, brooks, satirical, 1974, young, frankenstein, and, kenneth, branagh, s, 1994, mary, shelley, s, frankenstein, many, audiences, first, encounter, the, work, of, mary, shelley, through, adaptation, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, mary, shelley, came, to, be, seen, as, a, one, novel, author, at, best, rather, than, as, the, professional, writer, she, was, most, of, her, works, have, remained, out, of, print, until, the, last, thirty, years, obstructing, a, larger, view, of, her, achievement, in, recent, decades, the, republication, of, almost, all, her, writing, has, stimulated, a, new, recognition, of, its, value, her, habit, of, intensive, reading, and, study, revealed, in, her, journals, and, letters, and, reflected, in, her, works, is, now, better, appreciated, shelley, s, conception, of, herself, as, an, author, has, also, been, recognised, after, percy, s, death, she, wrote, of, her, authorial, ambitions, i, think, that, i, can, maintain, myself, and, there, is, something, inspiriting, in, the, idea, scholars, now, consider, mary, shelley, to, be, a, major, romantic, figure, significant, for, her, literary, achievement, and, her, political, voice, as, a, woman, and, a, liberal, collections, of, mary, shelley, s,
