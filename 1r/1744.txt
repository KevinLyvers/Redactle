isambard, kingdom, brunel, frs, minstce, z, m, b, r, d, k, d, m, b, r, u, n, l, izz, m, bard, king, d, m, broo, nell, 9, april, 1806, 15, september, 1859, was, a, british, civil, engineer, and, mechanical, engineer, who, is, considered, one, of, the, most, ingenious, and, prolific, figures, in, engineering, history, one, of, the, 19th, century, engineering, giants, and, one, of, the, greatest, figures, of, the, industrial, revolution, changed, the, face, of, the, english, landscape, with, his, groundbreaking, designs, and, ingenious, constructions, brunel, built, dockyards, the, great, western, railway, gwr, a, series, of, steamships, including, the, first, purpose, built, transatlantic, steamship, and, numerous, important, bridges, and, tunnels, his, designs, revolutionised, public, transport, and, modern, engineering, though, brunel, s, projects, were, not, always, successful, they, often, contained, innovative, solutions, to, long, standing, engineering, problems, during, his, career, brunel, achieved, many, engineering, firsts, including, assisting, his, father, in, the, building, of, the, first, tunnel, under, a, navigable, river, the, river, thames, and, the, development, of, the, ss, great, britain, the, first, propeller, driven, ocean, going, iron, ship, which, when, launched, in, 1843, was, the, largest, ship, ever, built, on, the, gwr, brunel, set, standards, for, a, well, built, railway, using, careful, surveys, to, minimise, gradients, and, curves, this, necessitated, expensive, construction, techniques, new, bridges, new, viaducts, and, the, two, mile, long, 3, 2, km, box, tunnel, one, controversial, feature, was, the, broad, gauge, of, 7, ft, 1, 4, in, 2, 140, mm, instead, of, what, was, later, to, be, known, as, standard, gauge, of, 4, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, 1, 435, mm, he, astonished, britain, by, proposing, to, extend, the, gwr, westward, to, north, america, by, building, steam, powered, iron, hulled, ships, he, designed, and, built, three, ships, that, revolutionised, naval, engineering, the, ss, great, western, 1838, the, ss, great, britain, 1843, and, the, ss, great, eastern, 1859, in, 2002, brunel, was, placed, second, in, a, bbc, public, poll, to, determine, the, 100, greatest, britons, in, 2006, the, bicentenary, of, his, birth, a, major, programme, of, events, celebrated, his, life, and, work, under, the, name, brunel, 200, isambard, kingdom, brunel, was, born, on, 9, april, 1806, in, britain, street, portsea, portsmouth, hampshire, where, his, father, was, working, on, block, making, machinery, he, was, named, isambard, after, his, father, the, french, civil, engineer, sir, marc, isambard, brunel, and, kingdom, after, his, english, mother, sophia, kingdom, his, mother, s, sister, elizabeth, kingdom, was, married, to, thomas, mudge, jr, son, of, thomas, mudge, the, horologist, he, had, two, elder, sisters, sophia, the, eldest, child, and, emma, the, whole, family, moved, to, london, in, 1808, for, his, father, s, work, brunel, had, a, happy, childhood, despite, the, family, s, constant, money, worries, with, his, father, acting, as, his, teacher, during, his, early, years, his, father, taught, him, drawing, and, observational, techniques, from, the, age, of, four, and, brunel, had, learned, euclidean, geometry, by, eight, during, this, time, he, learned, to, speak, french, fluently, and, the, basic, principles, of, engineering, he, was, encouraged, to, draw, interesting, buildings, and, identify, any, faults, in, their, structure, and, like, his, father, he, demonstrated, an, aptitude, for, mathematics, and, mechanics, when, brunel, was, eight, he, was, sent, to, dr, morrell, s, boarding, school, in, hove, where, he, learned, classics, his, father, a, frenchman, by, birth, was, determined, that, brunel, should, have, access, to, the, high, quality, education, he, had, enjoyed, in, his, youth, in, france, accordingly, at, the, age, of, 14, the, younger, brunel, was, enrolled, first, at, the, university, of, caen, then, at, lyc, e, henri, iv, in, paris, when, brunel, was, 15, his, father, who, had, accumulated, debts, of, over, 5, 000, was, sent, to, a, debtors, prison, after, three, months, went, by, with, no, prospect, of, release, marc, brunel, let, it, be, known, that, he, was, considering, an, offer, from, the, tsar, of, russia, in, august, 1821, facing, the, prospect, of, losing, a, prominent, engineer, the, government, relented, and, issued, marc, 5, 000, to, clear, his, debts, in, exchange, for, his, promise, to, remain, in, britain, when, brunel, completed, his, studies, at, henri, iv, in, 1822, his, father, had, him, presented, as, a, candidate, at, the, renowned, engineering, school, cole, polytechnique, but, as, a, foreigner, he, was, deemed, ineligible, for, entry, brunel, subsequently, studied, under, the, prominent, master, clockmaker, and, horologist, abraham, louis, breguet, who, praised, brunel, s, potential, in, letters, to, his, father, in, late, 1822, having, completed, his, apprenticeship, brunel, returned, to, england, brunel, worked, for, several, years, as, an, assistant, engineer, on, the, project, to, create, a, tunnel, under, london, s, river, thames, between, rotherhithe, and, wapping, with, tunnellers, driving, a, horizontal, shaft, from, one, side, of, the, river, to, the, other, under, the, most, difficult, and, dangerous, conditions, the, project, was, funded, by, the, thames, tunnel, company, and, brunel, s, father, marc, was, the, chief, engineer, the, american, naturalist, said, it, is, stated, also, that, the, operations, of, the, teredo, suggested, to, mr, brunel, his, method, of, tunnelling, the, thames, the, composition, of, the, riverbed, at, rotherhithe, was, often, little, more, than, waterlogged, sediment, and, loose, gravel, an, ingenious, tunnelling, shield, designed, by, marc, brunel, helped, protect, workers, from, cave, ins, but, two, incidents, of, severe, flooding, halted, work, for, long, periods, killing, several, workers, and, badly, injuring, the, younger, brunel, the, latter, incident, in, 1828, killed, the, two, most, senior, miners, and, brunel, himself, narrowly, escaped, death, he, was, seriously, injured, and, spent, six, months, recuperating, during, which, time, he, began, a, design, for, a, bridge, in, bristol, which, would, later, be, completed, as, the, clifton, suspension, bridge, the, event, stopped, work, on, the, tunnel, for, several, years, though, the, thames, tunnel, was, eventually, completed, during, marc, brunel, s, lifetime, his, son, had, no, further, involvement, with, the, tunnel, proper, only, using, the, abandoned, works, at, rotherhithe, to, further, his, abortive, gaz, experiments, this, was, based, on, an, idea, of, his, father, s, and, was, intended, to, develop, into, an, engine, that, ran, on, power, generated, from, alternately, heating, and, cooling, carbon, dioxide, made, from, ammonium, carbonate, and, sulphuric, acid, despite, interest, from, several, parties, the, admiralty, included, the, experiments, were, judged, by, brunel, to, be, a, failure, on, the, grounds, of, fuel, economy, alone, and, were, discontinued, after, 1834, in, 1865, the, east, london, railway, company, purchased, the, thames, tunnel, for, 200, 000, and, four, years, later, the, first, trains, passed, through, it, subsequently, the, tunnel, became, part, of, the, london, underground, system, and, it, remains, in, use, today, originally, as, part, of, the, east, london, line, now, incorporated, into, the, london, overground, brunel, is, perhaps, best, remembered, for, designs, for, the, clifton, suspension, bridge, in, bristol, begun, in, 1831, the, bridge, was, built, to, designs, based, on, brunel, s, but, with, significant, changes, spanning, over, 702, ft, 214, m, and, nominally, 249, ft, 76, m, above, the, river, avon, it, had, the, longest, span, of, any, bridge, in, the, world, at, the, time, of, construction, brunel, submitted, four, designs, to, a, committee, headed, by, thomas, telford, but, telford, rejected, all, entries, proposing, his, own, design, instead, vociferous, opposition, from, the, public, forced, the, organising, committee, to, hold, a, new, competition, which, was, won, by, brunel, afterwards, brunel, wrote, to, his, brother, in, law, the, politician, benjamin, hawes, of, all, the, wonderful, feats, i, have, performed, since, i, have, been, in, this, part, of, the, world, i, think, yesterday, i, performed, the, most, wonderful, i, produced, unanimity, among, 15, men, who, were, all, quarrelling, about, that, most, ticklish, subject, taste, work, on, the, clifton, bridge, started, in, 1831, but, was, suspended, due, to, the, queen, square, riots, caused, by, the, arrival, of, sir, charles, wetherell, in, clifton, the, riots, drove, away, investors, leaving, no, money, for, the, project, and, construction, ceased, brunel, did, not, live, to, see, the, bridge, finished, although, his, colleagues, and, admirers, at, the, institution, of, civil, engineers, felt, it, would, be, a, fitting, memorial, and, started, to, raise, new, funds, and, to, amend, the, design, work, recommenced, in, 1862, three, years, after, brunel, s, death, and, was, completed, in, 1864, in, 2011, it, was, suggested, by, historian, and, biographer, adrian, vaughan, that, brunel, did, not, design, the, bridge, as, eventually, built, as, the, later, changes, to, its, design, were, substantial, his, views, reflected, a, sentiment, stated, fifty, two, years, earlier, by, tom, rolt, in, his, 1959, book, brunel, re, engineering, of, suspension, chains, recovered, from, an, earlier, suspension, bridge, was, one, of, many, reasons, given, why, brunel, s, design, could, not, be, followed, exactly, hungerford, bridge, a, suspension, footbridge, across, the, thames, near, charing, cross, station, in, london, was, opened, in, may, 1845, its, central, span, was, 676, 5, feet, 206, 2, m, and, its, cost, was, 106, 000, it, was, replaced, by, a, new, railway, bridge, in, 1859, and, the, suspension, chains, were, used, to, complete, the, clifton, suspension, bridge, the, clifton, suspension, bridge, still, stands, and, over, 4, million, vehicles, traverse, it, every, year, brunel, designed, many, bridges, for, his, railway, projects, including, the, royal, albert, bridge, spanning, the, river, tamar, at, saltash, near, plymouth, somerset, bridge, an, unusual, laminated, timber, framed, bridge, near, bridgwater, the, windsor, railway, bridge, and, the, maidenhead, railway, bridge, over, the, thames, in, berkshire, this, last, was, the, flattest, widest, brick, arch, bridge, in, the, world, and, is, still, carrying, main, line, trains, to, the, west, even, though, today, s, trains, are, about, ten, times, heavier, than, in, brunel, s, time, throughout, his, railway, building, career, but, particularly, on, the, south, devon, and, cornwall, railways, where, economy, was, needed, and, there, were, many, valleys, to, cross, brunel, made, extensive, use, of, wood, for, the, construction, of, substantial, viaducts, these, have, had, to, be, replaced, over, the, years, as, their, primary, material, kyanised, baltic, pine, became, uneconomical, to, obtain, brunel, designed, the, royal, albert, bridge, in, 1855, for, the, cornwall, railway, after, parliament, rejected, his, original, plan, for, a, train, ferry, across, the, hamoaze, the, estuary, of, the, tidal, tamar, tavy, and, lynher, the, bridge, of, bowstring, girder, or, tied, arch, construction, consists, of, two, main, spans, of, 455, ft, 139, m, 100, ft, 30, m, above, mean, high, spring, tide, plus, 17, much, shorter, approach, spans, opened, by, prince, albert, on, 2, may, 1859, it, was, completed, in, the, year, of, brunel, s, death, several, of, brunel, s, bridges, over, the, great, western, railway, might, be, demolished, because, the, line, is, to, be, electrified, and, there, is, inadequate, clearance, for, overhead, wires, buckinghamshire, county, council, is, negotiating, to, have, further, options, pursued, in, order, that, all, nine, of, the, remaining, historic, bridges, on, the, line, can, be, saved, when, the, cornwall, railway, company, constructed, a, railway, line, between, plymouth, and, truro, opening, in, 1859, and, extended, it, to, falmouth, in, 1863, on, the, advice, of, brunel, they, constructed, the, river, crossings, in, the, form, of, wooden, viaducts, 42, in, total, consisting, of, timber, deck, spans, supported, by, fans, of, timber, bracing, built, on, masonry, piers, this, unusual, method, of, construction, substantially, reduced, the, first, cost, of, construction, compared, to, an, all, masonry, structure, but, at, the, cost, of, more, expensive, maintenance, in, 1934, the, last, of, brunel, s, timber, viaducts, was, dismantled, and, replaced, by, a, masonry, structure, brunel, s, last, major, undertaking, was, the, unique, three, bridges, london, work, began, in, 1856, and, was, completed, in, 1859, the, three, bridges, in, question, are, arranged, to, allow, the, routes, of, the, grand, junction, canal, great, western, and, brentford, railway, and, windmill, lane, to, cross, each, other, in, the, early, part, of, brunel, s, life, the, use, of, railways, began, to, take, off, as, a, major, means, of, transport, for, goods, this, influenced, brunel, s, involvement, in, railway, engineering, including, railway, bridge, engineering, in, 1833, before, the, thames, tunnel, was, complete, brunel, was, appointed, chief, engineer, of, the, great, western, railway, one, of, the, wonders, of, victorian, britain, running, from, london, to, bristol, and, later, exeter, the, company, was, founded, at, a, public, meeting, in, bristol, in, 1833, and, was, incorporated, by, act, of, parliament, in, 1835, it, was, brunel, s, vision, that, passengers, would, be, able, to, purchase, one, ticket, at, london, paddington, and, travel, from, london, to, new, york, changing, from, the, great, western, railway, to, the, great, western, steamship, at, the, terminus, in, neyland, west, wales, he, surveyed, the, entire, length, of, the, route, between, london, and, bristol, himself, with, the, help, of, many, including, his, solicitor, jeremiah, osborne, of, bristol, law, firm, osborne, clarke, who, on, one, occasion, rowed, brunel, down, the, river, avon, to, survey, the, bank, of, the, river, for, the, route, brunel, even, designed, the, royal, hotel, in, bath, which, opened, in, 1846, opposite, the, railway, station, brunel, made, two, controversial, decisions, to, use, a, broad, gauge, of, 7, ft, 1, 4, in, 2, 140, mm, for, the, track, which, he, believed, would, offer, superior, running, at, high, speeds, and, to, take, a, route, that, passed, north, of, the, marlborough, downs, an, area, with, no, significant, towns, though, it, offered, potential, connections, to, oxford, and, gloucester, and, then, to, follow, the, thames, valley, into, london, his, decision, to, use, broad, gauge, for, the, line, was, controversial, in, that, almost, all, british, railways, to, date, had, used, standard, gauge, brunel, said, that, this, was, nothing, more, than, a, carry, over, from, the, mine, railways, that, george, stephenson, had, worked, on, prior, to, making, the, world, s, first, passenger, railway, brunel, proved, through, both, calculation, and, a, series, of, trials, that, his, broader, gauge, was, the, optimum, size, for, providing, both, higher, speeds, and, a, stable, and, comfortable, ride, to, passengers, in, addition, the, wider, gauge, allowed, for, larger, goods, wagons, and, thus, greater, freight, capacity, drawing, on, brunel, s, experience, with, the, thames, tunnel, the, great, western, contained, a, series, of, technical, achievements, viaducts, such, as, the, one, in, ivybridge, specially, designed, stations, and, tunnels, including, the, box, tunnel, which, was, the, longest, railway, tunnel, in, the, world, at, that, time, with, the, opening, of, the, box, tunnel, the, line, from, london, to, bristol, was, complete, and, ready, for, trains, on, 30, june, 1841, the, initial, group, of, locomotives, ordered, by, brunel, to, his, own, specifications, proved, unsatisfactory, apart, from, the, north, star, locomotive, and, 20, year, old, daniel, gooch, later, sir, daniel, was, appointed, as, superintendent, of, locomotive, engines, brunel, and, gooch, chose, to, locate, their, locomotive, works, at, the, village, of, swindon, at, the, point, where, the, gradual, ascent, from, london, turned, into, the, steeper, descent, to, the, avon, valley, at, bath, after, brunel, s, death, the, decision, was, taken, that, standard, gauge, should, be, used, for, all, railways, in, the, country, at, the, original, welsh, terminus, of, the, great, western, railway, at, neyland, sections, of, the, broad, gauge, rails, are, used, as, handrails, at, the, quayside, and, information, boards, there, depict, various, aspects, of, brunel, s, life, there, is, also, a, larger, than, life, bronze, statue, of, him, holding, a, steamship, in, one, hand, and, a, locomotive, in, the, other, the, statue, has, been, replaced, after, an, earlier, theft, the, present, london, paddington, station, was, designed, by, brunel, and, opened, in, 1854, examples, of, his, designs, for, smaller, stations, on, the, great, western, and, associated, lines, which, survive, in, good, condition, include, mortimer, charlbury, and, bridgend, all, italianate, and, culham, tudorbethan, surviving, examples, of, wooden, train, sheds, in, his, style, are, at, frome, and, kingswear, the, swindon, steam, railway, museum, has, many, artefacts, from, brunel, s, time, on, the, great, western, railway, the, didcot, railway, centre, has, a, reconstructed, segment, of, 7, ft, 1, 4, in, 2, 140, mm, track, as, designed, by, brunel, and, working, steam, locomotives, in, the, same, gauge, parts, of, society, viewed, the, railways, more, negatively, some, landowners, felt, the, railways, were, a, threat, to, amenities, or, property, values, and, others, requested, tunnels, on, their, land, so, the, railway, could, not, be, seen, though, unsuccessful, another, of, brunel, s, uses, of, technical, innovations, was, the, atmospheric, railway, the, extension, of, the, great, western, railway, gwr, southward, from, exeter, towards, plymouth, technically, the, south, devon, railway, sdr, though, supported, by, the, gwr, instead, of, using, locomotives, the, trains, were, moved, by, clegg, and, samuda, s, patented, system, of, atmospheric, vacuum, traction, whereby, stationary, pumps, sucked, the, air, from, a, pipe, placed, in, the, centre, of, the, track, the, section, from, exeter, to, newton, now, newton, abbot, was, completed, on, this, principle, and, trains, ran, at, approximately, 68, miles, per, hour, 109, km, h, pumping, stations, with, distinctive, square, chimneys, were, sited, at, two, mile, intervals, fifteen, inch, 381, mm, pipes, were, used, on, the, level, portions, and, 22, inch, 559, mm, pipes, were, intended, for, the, steeper, gradients, the, technology, required, the, use, of, leather, flaps, to, seal, the, vacuum, pipes, the, natural, oils, were, drawn, out, of, the, leather, by, the, vacuum, making, the, leather, vulnerable, to, water, rotting, it, and, breaking, the, fibres, when, it, froze, during, the, winter, of, 1847, it, had, to, be, kept, supple, with, tallow, which, is, attractive, to, rats, the, flaps, were, eaten, and, vacuum, operation, lasted, less, than, a, year, from, 1847, experimental, service, began, in, september, operations, from, february, 1848, to, 10, september, 1848, deterioration, of, the, valve, due, to, the, reaction, of, tannin, and, iron, oxide, has, been, cited, as, the, last, straw, that, sank, the, project, as, the, continuous, valve, began, to, tear, from, its, rivets, over, most, of, its, length, and, the, estimated, replacement, cost, of, 25, 000, was, considered, prohibitive, the, system, never, managed, to, prove, itself, the, accounts, of, the, sdr, for, 1848, suggest, that, atmospheric, traction, cost, 3s, 1d, three, shillings, and, one, penny, per, mile, compared, to, 1s, 4d, mile, for, conventional, steam, power, because, of, the, many, operating, issues, associated, with, the, atmospheric, few, of, which, were, solved, during, its, working, life, the, actual, cost, efficiency, proved, impossible, to, calculate, several, south, devon, railway, engine, houses, still, stand, including, that, at, totnes, scheduled, as, a, grade, ii, listed, monument, in, 2007, and, at, starcross, a, section, of, the, pipe, without, the, leather, covers, is, preserved, at, the, didcot, railway, centre, in, 2017, inventor, max, schlienger, unveiled, a, working, model, of, an, updated, atmospheric, railroad, at, his, vineyard, in, the, northern, california, town, of, ukiah, brunel, had, proposed, extending, its, transport, network, by, boat, from, bristol, across, the, atlantic, ocean, to, new, york, city, before, the, great, western, railway, opened, in, 1835, the, great, western, steamship, company, was, formed, by, thomas, guppy, for, that, purpose, it, was, widely, disputed, whether, it, would, be, commercially, viable, for, a, ship, powered, purely, by, steam, to, make, such, long, journeys, technological, developments, in, the, early, 1830s, including, the, invention, of, the, surface, condenser, which, allowed, boilers, to, run, on, salt, water, without, stopping, to, be, cleaned, made, longer, journeys, more, possible, but, it, was, generally, thought, that, a, ship, would, not, be, able, to, carry, enough, fuel, for, the, trip, and, have, room, for, commercial, cargo, brunel, applied, the, experimental, evidence, of, beaufoy, and, further, developed, the, theory, that, the, amount, a, ship, could, carry, increased, as, the, cube, of, its, dimensions, whereas, the, amount, of, resistance, a, ship, experienced, from, the, water, as, it, travelled, increased, by, only, a, square, of, its, dimensions, this, would, mean, that, moving, a, larger, ship, would, take, proportionately, less, fuel, than, a, smaller, ship, to, test, this, theory, brunel, offered, his, services, for, free, to, the, great, western, steamship, company, which, appointed, him, to, its, building, committee, and, entrusted, him, with, designing, its, first, ship, the, great, western, when, it, was, built, the, great, western, was, the, longest, ship, in, the, world, at, 236, ft, 72, m, with, a, 250, foot, 76, m, keel, the, ship, was, constructed, mainly, from, wood, but, brunel, added, bolts, and, iron, diagonal, reinforcements, to, maintain, the, keel, s, strength, in, addition, to, its, steam, powered, paddle, wheels, the, ship, carried, four, masts, for, sails, the, great, western, embarked, on, her, maiden, voyage, from, avonmouth, bristol, to, new, york, on, 8, april, 1838, with, 600, long, tons, 610, 000, kg, of, coal, cargo, and, seven, passengers, on, board, brunel, himself, missed, this, initial, crossing, having, been, injured, during, a, fire, aboard, the, ship, as, she, was, returning, from, fitting, out, in, london, as, the, fire, delayed, the, launch, several, days, the, great, western, missed, its, opportunity, to, claim, the, title, as, the, first, ship, to, cross, the, atlantic, under, steam, power, alone, even, with, a, four, day, head, start, the, competing, sirius, arrived, only, one, day, earlier, having, virtually, exhausted, its, coal, supply, in, contrast, the, great, western, crossing, of, the, atlantic, took, 15, days, and, five, hours, and, the, ship, arrived, at, her, destination, with, a, third, of, its, coal, still, remaining, demonstrating, that, brunel, s, calculations, were, correct, the, great, western, had, proved, the, viability, of, commercial, transatlantic, steamship, service, which, led, the, great, western, steamboat, company, to, use, her, in, regular, service, between, bristol, and, new, york, from, 1838, to, 1846, she, made, 64, crossings, and, was, the, first, ship, to, hold, the, blue, riband, with, a, crossing, time, of, 13, days, westbound, and, 12, days, 6, hours, eastbound, the, service, was, commercially, successful, enough, for, a, sister, ship, to, be, required, which, brunel, was, asked, to, design, brunel, had, become, convinced, of, the, superiority, of, propeller, driven, ships, over, paddle, wheels, after, tests, conducted, aboard, the, propeller, driven, steamship, archimedes, he, incorporated, a, large, six, bladed, propeller, into, his, design, for, the, 322, foot, 98, m, great, britain, which, was, launched, in, 1843, great, britain, is, considered, the, first, modern, ship, being, built, of, metal, rather, than, wood, powered, by, an, engine, rather, than, wind, or, oars, and, driven, by, propeller, rather, than, paddle, wheel, she, was, the, first, iron, hulled, propeller, driven, ship, to, cross, the, atlantic, ocean, her, maiden, voyage, was, made, in, august, and, september, 1845, from, liverpool, to, new, york, in, 1846, she, was, run, aground, at, dundrum, county, down, she, was, salvaged, and, employed, in, the, australian, service, she, is, currently, fully, preserved, and, open, to, the, public, in, bristol, uk, in, 1852, brunel, turned, to, a, third, ship, larger, than, her, predecessors, intended, for, voyages, to, india, and, australia, the, great, eastern, originally, dubbed, leviathan, was, cutting, edge, technology, for, her, time, almost, 700, ft, 210, m, long, fitted, out, with, the, most, luxurious, appointments, and, capable, of, carrying, over, 4, 000, passengers, great, eastern, was, designed, to, cruise, non, stop, from, london, to, sydney, and, back, since, engineers, of, the, time, mistakenly, believed, that, australia, had, no, coal, reserves, and, she, remained, the, largest, ship, built, until, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, like, many, of, brunel, s, ambitious, projects, the, ship, soon, ran, over, budget, and, behind, schedule, in, the, face, of, a, series, of, technical, problems, the, ship, has, been, portrayed, as, a, white, elephant, but, it, has, been, argued, by, david, p, billington, that, in, this, case, brunel, s, failure, was, principally, one, of, economics, his, ships, were, simply, years, ahead, of, their, time, his, vision, and, engineering, innovations, made, the, building, of, large, scale, propeller, driven, all, metal, steamships, a, practical, reality, but, the, prevailing, economic, and, industrial, conditions, meant, that, it, would, be, several, decades, before, transoceanic, steamship, travel, emerged, as, a, viable, industry, great, eastern, was, built, at, john, scott, russell, s, napier, yard, in, london, and, after, two, trial, trips, in, 1859, set, forth, on, her, maiden, voyage, from, liverpool, to, new, york, on, 17, june, 1860, though, a, failure, at, her, original, purpose, of, passenger, travel, she, eventually, found, a, role, as, an, oceanic, telegraph, cable, layer, under, captain, sir, james, anderson, the, great, eastern, played, a, significant, role, in, laying, the, first, lasting, transatlantic, telegraph, cable, which, enabled, telecommunication, between, europe, and, north, america, britain, entered, into, the, crimean, war, during, 1854, and, an, old, turkish, barracks, became, the, british, army, hospital, in, scutari, injured, men, contracted, a, variety, of, illnesses, including, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and, malaria, due, to, poor, conditions, there, and, florence, nightingale, sent, a, plea, to, the, times, for, the, government, to, produce, a, solution, brunel, was, working, on, the, great, eastern, amongst, other, projects, but, accepted, the, task, in, february, 1855, of, designing, and, building, the, war, office, requirement, of, a, temporary, pre, fabricated, hospital, that, could, be, shipped, to, crimea, and, erected, there, in, five, months, the, team, he, had, assembled, designed, built, and, shipped, pre, fabricated, wood, and, canvas, buildings, providing, them, complete, with, advice, on, transportation, and, positioning, of, the, facilities, brunel, had, been, working, with, gloucester, docks, based, william, eassie, on, the, launching, stage, for, the, great, eastern, eassie, had, designed, and, built, wooden, prefabricated, huts, used, in, both, the, australian, gold, rush, as, well, as, by, the, british, and, french, armies, in, the, crimea, using, wood, supplied, by, timber, importers, price, co, eassie, fabricated, 18, of, the, 50, patient, wards, designed, by, brunel, shipped, directly, via, 16, ships, from, gloucester, docks, to, the, dardanelles, the, renkioi, hospital, was, subsequently, erected, near, scutari, hospital, where, nightingale, was, based, in, the, malaria, free, area, of, renkioi, his, designs, incorporated, the, necessities, of, hygiene, access, to, sanitation, ventilation, drainage, and, even, rudimentary, temperature, controls, they, were, feted, as, a, great, success, with, some, sources, stating, that, of, the, approximately, 1, 300, patients, treated, in, the, hospital, there, were, only, 50, deaths, in, the, scutari, hospital, it, replaced, deaths, were, said, to, be, as, many, as, ten, times, this, number, nightingale, referred, to, them, as, those, magnificent, huts, the, practice, of, building, hospitals, from, pre, fabricated, modules, survives, today, with, hospitals, such, as, the, bristol, royal, infirmary, being, created, in, this, manner, in, 1854, and, 1855, with, the, encouragement, of, john, fox, burgoyne, brunel, presented, the, admiralty, with, designs, for, floating, gun, batteries, these, were, intended, as, siege, weapons, for, attacking, russian, ports, however, these, proposals, were, not, taken, up, confirming, brunel, s, opinion, of, the, admiralty, as, being, opposed, to, novel, ideas,

performing, a, conjuring, trick, for, the, amusement, of, his, children, in, 1843, brunel, accidentally, inhaled, a, half, sovereign, coin, which, became, lodged, in, his, windpipe, a, special, pair, of, forceps, failed, to, remove, it, as, did, a, machine, devised, by, brunel, to, shake, it, loose, at, the, suggestion, of, his, father, brunel, was, strapped, to, a, board, and, turned, upside, down, and, the, coin, was, jerked, free, he, recuperated, at, teignmouth, and, enjoyed, the, area, so, much, that, he, purchased, an, estate, at, watcombe, in, torquay, devon, here, he, commissioned, william, burn, to, design, brunel, manor, and, its, gardens, to, be, his, country, home, he, never, saw, the, house, or, gardens, finished, as, he, died, before, it, was, completed, brunel, a, heavy,

side, of, the, nave, many, mourned, brunel, s, passing, in, spite, and, because, of, his, business, ventures, an, obituary, in, the, morning, chronicle, noted, brunel, was, the, right, man, for, the, nation, but, unfortunately, he, was, not, the, right, man, for, the, shareholders, they, must, stoop, who, must, gather, gold, and, brunel, could, never, stoop, the, history, of, invention, records, no, instance, of, grand, novelties, so, boldly, imagined, and, so, successfully, carried, out, by, the, same, individual, brunel, was, survived, by, his, wife, mary, and, three, children, isambard,
