paul, koin, greek, romanized, pa, los, also, named, saul, of, tarsus, aramaic, romanized, l, commonly, known, as, paul, the, apostle, and, saint, paul, was, a, christian, apostle, c, 5, c, 64, 65, ad, who, spread, the, teachings, of, jesus, in, the, first, century, world, for, his, contributions, towards, the, new, testament, he, is, generally, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, figures, of, the, apostolic, age, and, he, also, founded, several, christian, communities, in, asia, minor, and, europe, from, the, mid, 40s, to, the, mid, 50s, ad, the, main, source, of, information, on, paul, s, life, and, works, is, the, acts, of, the, apostles, in, the, new, testament, approximately, half, of, its, content, documents, his, travels, preaching, and, miracles, paul, was, not, one, of, the, twelve, apostles, and, did, not, know, jesus, during, his, lifetime, according, to, the, acts, paul, lived, as, a, pharisee, and, participated, in, the, persecution, of, early, disciples, of, jesus, possibly, hellenised, diaspora, jews, converted, to, christianity, in, the, area, of, jerusalem, prior, to, his, conversion, some, time, after, having, approved, of, the, execution, of, stephen, paul, was, traveling, on, the, road, to, damascus, so, that, he, might, find, any, christians, there, and, bring, them, bound, to, jerusalem, at, midday, a, light, brighter, than, the, sun, shone, around, both, him, and, those, with, him, causing, all, to, fall, to, the, ground, with, the, risen, christ, verbally, addressing, paul, regarding, his, persecution, in, a, vision, having, been, made, blind, along, with, being, commanded, to, enter, the, city, his, sight, was, restored, three, days, later, by, ananias, of, damascus, after, these, events, paul, was, baptized, beginning, immediately, to, proclaim, that, jesus, of, nazareth, was, the, jewish, messiah, and, the, son, of, god, he, made, three, missionary, journeys, to, spread, the, christian, message, to, non, jewish, communities, in, asia, minor, the, greek, provinces, of, achaia, macedonia, and, cyprus, as, well, as, judea, and, syria, as, narrated, in, the, acts, fourteen, of, the, 27, books, in, the, new, testament, have, traditionally, been, attributed, to, paul, seven, of, the, pauline, epistles, are, undisputed, by, scholars, as, being, authentic, with, varying, degrees, of, argument, about, the, remainder, pauline, authorship, of, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, is, not, asserted, in, the, epistle, itself, and, was, already, doubted, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, it, was, almost, unquestioningly, accepted, from, the, 5th, to, the, 16th, centuries, that, paul, was, the, author, of, hebrews, but, that, view, is, now, almost, universally, rejected, by, scholars, the, other, six, are, believed, by, some, scholars, to, have, come, from, followers, writing, in, his, name, using, material, from, paul, s, surviving, letters, and, letters, written, by, him, that, no, longer, survive, other, scholars, argue, that, the, idea, of, a, pseudonymous, author, for, the, disputed, epistles, raises, many, problems, today, paul, s, epistles, continue, to, be, vital, roots, of, the, theology, worship, and, pastoral, life, in, the, latin, and, protestant, traditions, of, the, west, as, well, as, the, eastern, catholic, and, orthodox, traditions, of, the, east, paul, s, influence, on, christian, thought, and, practice, has, been, characterized, as, being, as, profound, as, it, is, pervasive, among, that, of, many, other, apostles, and, missionaries, involved, in, the, spread, of, the, christian, faith, paul, s, jewish, name, was, saul, hebrew, modern, sha, l, tiberian, l, perhaps, after, the, biblical, king, saul, the, first, king, of, israel, and, like, paul, a, member, of, the, tribe, of, benjamin, the, latin, name, paulus, meaning, small, was, not, a, result, of, his, conversion, as, is, commonly, believed, but, a, second, name, for, use, in, communicating, with, a, greco, roman, audience, according, to, the, acts, of, the, apostles, he, was, a, roman, citizen, as, such, he, bore, the, latin, name, paulus, which, translates, in, biblical, greek, as, paulos, it, was, typical, for, the, jews, of, that, time, to, have, two, names, one, hebrew, the, other, latin, or, greek, jesus, called, him, saul, saul, in, the, hebrew, tongue, in, the, acts, of, the, apostles, when, he, had, the, vision, which, led, to, his, conversion, on, the, road, to, damascus, later, in, a, vision, to, ananias, of, damascus, the, lord, referred, to, him, as, saul, of, tarsus, when, ananias, came, to, restore, his, sight, he, called, him, brother, saul, in, acts, 13, 9, saul, is, called, paul, for, the, first, time, on, the, island, of, cyprus, much, later, than, the, time, of, his, conversion, the, author, of, luke, acts, indicates, that, the, names, were, interchangeable, saul, who, also, is, called, paul, he, refers, to, him, as, paul, through, the, remainder, of, acts, this, was, apparently, paul, s, preference, since, he, is, called, paul, in, all, other, bible, books, where, he, is, mentioned, including, those, that, he, authored, adopting, his, roman, name, was, typical, of, paul, s, missionary, style, his, method, was, to, put, people, at, ease, and, approach, them, with, his, message, in, a, language, and, style, that, was, relatable, to, them, as, he, did, in, 1, corinthians, 9, 19, 23, the, main, source, for, information, about, paul, s, life, is, the, material, found, in, his, epistles, and, in, the, acts, of, the, apostles, however, the, epistles, contain, little, information, about, paul, s, pre, conversion, past, the, acts, of, the, apostles, recounts, more, information, but, leaves, several, parts, of, paul, s, life, out, of, its, narrative, such, as, his, probable, but, undocumented, execution, in, rome, the, acts, of, the, apostles, also, appear, to, contradict, paul, s, epistles, on, multiple, matters, in, particular, concerning, the, frequency, of, paul, s, visits, to, the, church, in, jerusalem, sources, outside, the, new, testament, that, mention, paul, include, the, two, main, sources, of, information, that, give, access, to, the, earliest, segments, of, paul, s, career, are, the, acts, of, the, apostles, and, the, autobiographical, elements, of, paul, s, letters, to, the, early, christian, communities, paul, was, likely, born, between, the, years, of, 5, bc, and, 5, ad, the, acts, of, the, apostles, indicates, that, paul, was, a, roman, citizen, by, birth, but, helmut, koester, takes, issue, with, the, evidence, presented, by, the, text, he, was, from, a, devout, jewish, family, based, in, the, city, of, tarsus, which, had, been, made, part, of, the, roman, province, of, syria, by, the, time, of, paul, s, adulthood, tarsus, was, of, the, larger, centers, of, trade, on, the, mediterranean, coast, and, renowned, for, its, academy, it, had, been, among, the, most, influential, cities, in, asia, minor, since, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, who, died, in, 323, bc, paul, referred, to, himself, as, being, of, the, stock, of, israel, of, the, tribe, of, benjamin, a, hebrew, of, the, hebrews, as, touching, the, law, a, pharisee, the, bible, reveals, very, little, about, paul, s, family, acts, quotes, paul, referring, to, his, family, by, saying, he, was, a, pharisee, born, of, pharisees, paul, s, nephew, his, sister, s, son, is, mentioned, in, acts, 23, 16, in, romans, 16, 7, he, states, that, his, relatives, andronicus, and, junia, were, christians, before, he, was, and, were, prominent, among, the, apostles, the, family, had, a, history, of, religious, piety, apparently, the, family, lineage, had, been, very, attached, to, pharisaic, traditions, and, observances, for, generations, acts, says, that, he, was, an, artisan, involved, in, the, leather, crafting, or, tent, making, profession, this, was, to, become, an, initial, connection, with, priscilla, and, aquila, with, whom, he, would, partner, in, tentmaking, and, later, become, very, important, teammates, as, fellow, missionaries, while, he, was, still, fairly, young, he, was, sent, to, jerusalem, to, receive, his, education, at, the, school, of, gamaliel, one, of, the, most, noted, teachers, of, jewish, law, in, history, although, modern, scholarship, accepts, that, paul, was, educated, under, the, supervision, of, gamaliel, in, jerusalem, he, was, not, preparing, to, become, a, scholar, of, jewish, law, and, probably, never, had, any, contact, with, the, hillelite, school, some, of, his, family, may, have, resided, in, jerusalem, since, later, the, son, of, one, of, his, sisters, saved, his, life, there, nothing, more, is, known, of, his, biography, until, he, takes, an, active, part, in, the, martyrdom, of, stephen, a, hellenised, diaspora, jew, some, modern, scholarship, argues, that, while, paul, was, fluent, in, koine, greek, the, language, he, used, to, write, his, letters, his, first, language, was, probably, aramaic, in, his, letters, paul, drew, heavily, on, his, knowledge, of, stoic, philosophy, using, stoic, terms, and, metaphors, to, assist, his, new, gentile, converts, in, their, understanding, of, the, gospel, and, to, explain, his, christology, paul, says, that, prior, to, his, conversion, he, persecuted, early, christians, beyond, measure, more, specifically, hellenised, diaspora, jewish, members, who, had, returned, to, the, area, of, jerusalem, according, to, james, dunn, the, jerusalem, community, consisted, of, hebrews, jews, speaking, both, aramaic, and, greek, and, hellenists, jews, speaking, only, greek, possibly, diaspora, jews, who, had, resettled, in, jerusalem, paul, s, initial, persecution, of, christians, probably, was, directed, against, these, greek, speaking, hellenists, due, to, their, anti, temple, attitude, within, the, early, jewish, christian, community, this, also, set, them, apart, from, the, hebrews, and, their, continuing, participation, in, the, temple, cult, paul, s, conversion, to, the, movement, of, followers, of, jesus, can, be, dated, to, 31, 36, ad, by, his, reference, to, it, in, one, of, his, letters, in, galatians, 1, 16, paul, writes, that, god, was, pleased, to, reveal, his, son, to, me, in, 1, corinthians, 15, 8, as, he, lists, the, order, in, which, jesus, appeared, to, his, disciples, after, his, resurrection, paul, writes, last, of, all, as, to, one, untimely, born, he, appeared, to, me, also, according, to, the, account, in, the, acts, of, the, apostles, it, took, place, on, the, road, to, damascus, where, he, reported, having, experienced, a, vision, of, the, ascended, jesus, the, account, says, that, he, fell, to, the, ground, and, heard, a, voice, saying, to, him, saul, saul, why, do, you, persecute, me, he, asked, who, are, you, lord, the, reply, came, i, am, jesus, whom, you, are, persecuting, according, to, the, account, in, acts, 9, 1, 22, he, was, blinded, for, three, days, and, had, to, be, led, into, damascus, by, the, hand, during, these, three, days, saul, took, no, food, or, water, and, spent, his, time, in, prayer, to, god, when, ananias, of, damascus, arrived, he, laid, his, hands, on, him, and, said, brother, saul, the, lord, jesus, that, appeared, unto, thee, in, the, way, as, thou, camest, hath, sent, me, that, thou, mightest, receive, thy, sight, and, be, filled, with, the, holy, ghost, his, sight, was, restored, he, got, up, and, was, baptized, this, story, occurs, only, in, acts, not, in, the, pauline, epistles, the, author, of, the, acts, of, the, apostles, may, have, learned, of, paul, s, conversion, from, the, church, in, jerusalem, or, from, the, church, in, antioch, or, possibly, from, paul, himself, according, to, timo, eskola, early, christian, theology, and, discourse, was, influenced, by, the, jewish, merkabah, tradition, john, bowker, alan, segal, and, daniel, boyarin, have, variously, argued, that, paul, s, accounts, of, his, conversion, experience, and, his, ascent, to, the, heavens, in, 2, corinthians, 12, as, the, earliest, first, person, accounts, that, are, extant, of, a, merkabah, mystic, in, jewish, or, christian, literature, conversely, timothy, churchill, has, argued, that, paul, s, damascus, road, encounter, does, not, fit, the, pattern, of, merkabah, according, to, acts, and, immediately, he, proclaimed, jesus, in, the, synagogues, saying, he, is, the, son, of, god, and, all, who, heard, him, were, amazed, and, said, is, not, this, the, man, who, made, havoc, in, jerusalem, of, those, who, called, upon, this, name, and, has, he, not, come, here, for, this, purpose, to, bring, them, bound, before, the, chief, priests, but, saul, increased, all, the, more, in, strength, and, confounded, the, jews, who, lived, in, damascus, by, proving, that, jesus, was, the, christ, after, his, conversion, paul, went, to, damascus, where, acts, 9, states, he, was, healed, of, his, blindness, and, baptized, by, ananias, of, damascus, paul, says, that, it, was, in, damascus, that, he, barely, escaped, death, paul, also, says, that, he, then, went, first, to, arabia, and, then, came, back, to, damascus, paul, s, trip, to, arabia, is, not, mentioned, anywhere, else, in, the, bible, and, some, suppose, he, actually, traveled, to, mount, sinai, for, meditations, in, the, desert, he, describes, in, galatians, how, three, years, after, his, conversion, he, went, to, jerusalem, there, he, met, james, and, stayed, with, simon, peter, for, 15, days, paul, located, mount, sinai, in, arabia, in, galatians, 4, 24, 25, paul, asserted, that, he, received, the, gospel, not, from, man, but, directly, by, the, revelation, of, jesus, christ, he, claimed, almost, total, independence, from, the, jerusalem, community, possibly, in, the, cenacle, but, agreed, with, it, on, the, nature, and, content, of, the, gospel, he, appeared, eager, to, bring, material, support, to, jerusalem, from, the, various, growing, gentile, churches, that, he, started, in, his, writings, paul, used, the, persecutions, he, endured, to, avow, proximity, and, union, with, jesus, and, as, a, validation, of, his, teaching, paul, s, narrative, in, galatians, states, that, 14, years, after, his, conversion, he, went, again, to, jerusalem, it, is, not, known, what, happened, during, this, time, but, both, acts, and, galatians, provide, some, details, at, the, end, of, this, time, barnabas, went, to, find, paul, and, brought, him, to, antioch, the, christian, community, at, antioch, had, been, established, by, hellenised, diaspora, jews, living, in, jerusalem, who, played, an, important, role, in, reaching, a, gentile, greek, audience, notably, at, antioch, which, had, a, large, jewish, community, and, significant, numbers, of, gentile, god, fearers, from, antioch, the, mission, to, the, gentiles, started, which, would, fundamentally, change, the, character, of, the, early, christian, movement, eventually, turning, it, into, a, new, gentile, religion, when, a, famine, occurred, in, judea, around, 45, 46, paul, and, barnabas, journeyed, to, jerusalem, to, deliver, financial, support, from, the, antioch, community, according, to, acts, antioch, had, become, an, alternative, center, for, christians, following, the, dispersion, of, the, believers, after, the, death, of, stephen, it, was, in, antioch, that, the, followers, of, jesus, were, first, called, christians, the, author, of, acts, arranges, paul, s, travels, into, three, separate, journeys, the, first, journey, for, which, paul, and, barnabas, were, commissioned, by, the, antioch, community, and, led, initially, by, barnabas, took, barnabas, and, paul, from, antioch, to, cyprus, then, into, southern, asia, minor, and, finally, returning, to, antioch, in, cyprus, paul, rebukes, and, blinds, elymas, the, magician, who, was, criticizing, their, teachings, they, sailed, to, perga, in, pamphylia, john, mark, left, them, and, returned, to, jerusalem, paul, and, barnabas, went, on, to, pisidian, antioch, on, sabbath, they, went, to, the, synagogue, the, leaders, invited, them, to, speak, paul, reviewed, israelite, history, from, life, in, egypt, to, king, david, he, introduced, jesus, as, a, descendant, of, david, brought, to, israel, by, god, he, said, that, his, group, had, come, to, bring, the, message, of, salvation, he, recounted, the, story, of, jesus, death, and, resurrection, he, quoted, from, the, septuagint, to, assert, that, jesus, was, the, promised, christos, who, brought, them, forgiveness, for, their, sins, both, the, jews, and, the, god, fearing, gentiles, invited, them, to, talk, more, next, sabbath, at, that, time, almost, the, whole, city, gathered, this, upset, some, influential, jews, who, spoke, against, them, paul, used, the, occasion, to, announce, a, change, in, his, mission, which, from, then, on, would, be, to, the, gentiles, antioch, served, as, a, major, christian, home, base, for, paul, s, early, missionary, activities, and, he, remained, there, for, a, long, time, with, the, disciples, at, the, conclusion, of, his, first, journey, the, exact, duration, of, paul, s, stay, in, antioch, is, unknown, with, estimates, ranging, from, nine, months, to, as, long, as, eight, years, in, raymond, e, brown, s, an, introduction, to, the, new, testament, published, in, 1997, a, chronology, of, events, in, paul, s, life, is, presented, illustrated, from, later, 20th, century, writings, of, biblical, scholars, the, first, missionary, journey, of, paul, is, assigned, a, traditional, and, majority, dating, of, 46, 49, ad, compared, to, a, revisionist, and, minority, dating, of, after, 37, ad, a, vital, meeting, between, paul, and, the, jerusalem, church, took, place, in, the, year, 49, ad, by, traditional, and, majority, dating, compared, to, a, revisionist, and, minority, dating, of, 47, 51, ad, the, meeting, is, described, in, acts, 15, 2, and, usually, seen, as, the, same, event, mentioned, by, paul, in, galatians, 2, 1, the, key, question, raised, was, whether, gentile, converts, needed, to, be, circumcised, at, this, meeting, paul, states, in, his, letter, to, the, galatians, peter, james, and, john, accepted, paul, s, mission, to, the, gentiles, the, jerusalem, meetings, are, mentioned, in, acts, and, also, in, paul, s, letters, for, example, the, jerusalem, visit, for, famine, relief, apparently, corresponds, to, the, first, visit, to, peter, and, james, only, f, f, bruce, suggested, that, the, fourteen, years, could, be, from, paul, s, conversion, rather, than, from, his, first, visit, to, jerusalem, despite, the, agreement, achieved, at, the, council, of, jerusalem, paul, recounts, how, he, later, publicly, confronted, peter, in, a, dispute, sometimes, called, the, incident, at, antioch, over, peter, s, reluctance, to, share, a, meal, with, gentile, christians, in, antioch, because, they, did, not, strictly, adhere, to, jewish, customs, writing, later, of, the, incident, paul, recounts, i, opposed, to, his, face, because, he, was, clearly, in, the, wrong, and, says, he, told, peter, you, are, a, jew, yet, you, live, like, a, gentile, and, not, like, a, jew, how, is, it, then, that, you, force, gentiles, to, follow, jewish, customs, paul, also, mentions, that, even, barnabas, his, traveling, companion, and, fellow, apostle, until, that, time, sided, with, peter, the, outcome, of, the, incident, remains, uncertain, the, catholic, encyclopedia, suggests, that, paul, won, the, argument, because, paul, s, account, of, the, incident, leaves, no, doubt, that, peter, saw, the, justice, of, the, rebuke, however, paul, himself, never, mentions, a, victory, and, l, michael, white, s, from, jesus, to, christianity, draws, the, opposite, conclusion, the, blowup, with, peter, was, a, total, failure, of, political, bravado, and, paul, soon, left, antioch, as, persona, non, grata, never, again, to, return, the, primary, source, account, of, the, incident, at, antioch, is, paul, s, letter, to, the, galatians, paul, left, for, his, second, missionary, journey, from, jerusalem, in, late, autumn, 49, ad, after, the, meeting, of, the, council, of, jerusalem, where, the, circumcision, question, was, debated, on, their, trip, around, the, mediterranean, sea, paul, and, his, companion, barnabas, stopped, in, antioch, where, they, had, a, sharp, argument, about, taking, john, mark, with, them, on, their, trips, the, acts, of, the, apostles, said, that, john, mark, had, left, them, in, a, previous, trip, and, gone, home, unable, to, resolve, the, dispute, paul, and, barnabas, decided, to, separate, barnabas, took, john, mark, with, him, while, silas, joined, paul, paul, and, silas, initially, visited, tarsus, paul, s, birthplace, derbe, and, lystra, in, lystra, they, met, timothy, a, disciple, who, was, spoken, well, of, and, decided, to, take, him, with, them, paul, and, his, companions, silas, and, timothy, had, plans, to, journey, to, the, southwest, portion, of, asia, minor, to, preach, the, gospel, but, during, the, night, paul, had, a, vision, of, a, man, of, macedonia, standing, and, begging, him, to, go, to, macedonia, to, help, them, after, seeing, the, vision, paul, and, his, companions, left, for, macedonia, to, preach, the, gospel, to, them, the, church, kept, growing, adding, believers, and, strengthening, in, faith, daily, in, philippi, paul, cast, a, spirit, of, divination, out, of, a, servant, girl, whose, masters, were, then, unhappy, about, the, loss, of, income, her, soothsaying, provided, they, seized, paul, and, silas, and, dragged, them, into, the, marketplace, before, the, authorities, and, paul, and, silas, were, put, in, jail, after, a, miraculous, earthquake, the, gates, of, the, prison, fell, apart, and, paul, and, silas, could, have, escaped, but, remained, this, event, led, to, the, conversion, of, the, jailor, they, continued, traveling, going, by, berea, and, then, to, athens, where, paul, preached, to, the, jews, and, god, fearing, greeks, in, the, synagogue, and, to, the, greek, intellectuals, in, the, areopagus, paul, continued, from, athens, to, corinth, around, 50, 52, ad, paul, spent, 18, months, in, corinth, the, reference, in, acts, to, proconsul, gallio, helps, ascertain, this, date, cf, gallio, inscription, in, corinth, paul, met, priscilla, and, aquila, who, became, faithful, believers, and, helped, paul, through, his, other, missionary, journeys, the, couple, followed, paul, and, his, companions, to, ephesus, and, stayed, there, to, start, one, of, the, strongest, and, most, faithful, churches, at, that, time, in, 52, departing, from, corinth, paul, stopped, at, the, nearby, village, of, cenchreae, to, have, his, hair, cut, off, because, of, a, vow, he, had, earlier, taken, it, is, possible, this, was, to, be, a, final, haircut, prior, to, fulfilling, his, vow, to, become, a, nazirite, for, a, defined, period, of, time, with, priscilla, and, aquila, the, missionaries, then, sailed, to, ephesus, and, then, paul, alone, went, on, to, caesarea, to, greet, the, church, there, he, then, traveled, north, to, antioch, where, he, stayed, for, some, time, ancient, greek, some, new, testament, texts, suggest, that, he, also, visited, jerusalem, during, this, period, for, one, of, the, jewish, feasts, possibly, pentecost, textual, critic, henry, alford, and, others, consider, the, reference, to, a, jerusalem, visit, to, be, genuine, and, it, accords, with, acts, 21, 29, according, to, which, paul, and, trophimus, the, ephesian, had, previously, been, seen, in, jerusalem, according, to, acts, paul, began, his, third, missionary, journey, by, traveling, all, around, the, region, of, galatia, and, phrygia, to, strengthen, teach, and, rebuke, the, believers, paul, then, traveled, to, ephesus, an, important, center, of, early, christianity, and, stayed, there, for, almost, three, years, probably, working, there, as, a, tentmaker, as, he, had, done, when, he, stayed, in, corinth, he, is, said, to, have, performed, numerous, miracles, healing, people, and, casting, out, demons, and, he, apparently, organized, missionary, activity, in, other, regions, paul, left, ephesus, after, an, attack, from, a, local, silversmith, resulted, in, a, pro, artemis, riot, involving, most, of, the, city, during, his, stay, in, ephesus, paul, wrote, four, letters, to, the, church, in, corinth, the, letter, to, the, church, in, philippi, is, generally, thought, to, have, been, written, from, ephesus, though, a, minority, view, considers, it, may, have, been, penned, while, he, was, imprisoned, in, rome, paul, went, through, macedonia, into, achaea, and, stayed, in, greece, probably, corinth, for, three, months, during, 56, 57, ad, commentators, generally, agree, that, paul, dictated, his, epistle, to, the, romans, during, this, period, he, then, made, ready, to, continue, on, to, syria, but, he, changed, his, plans, and, traveled, back, through, macedonia, putatively, because, certain, jews, had, made, a, plot, against, him, in, romans, 15, 19, paul, wrote, that, he, visited, illyricum, but, he, may, have, meant, what, would, now, be, called, illyria, graeca, which, was, at, that, time, a, division, of, the, roman, province, of, macedonia, on, their, way, back, to, jerusalem, paul, and, his, companions, visited, other, cities, such, as, philippi, troas, miletus, rhodes, and, tyre, paul, finished, his, trip, with, a, stop, in, caesarea, where, he, and, his, companions, stayed, with, philip, the, evangelist, before, finally, arriving, in, jerusalem, among, the, writings, of, the, early, christians, pope, clement, i, said, that, paul, was, herald, of, the, gospel, of, christ, in, the, west, and, that, he, had, gone, to, the, extremity, of, the, west, where, lightfoot, s, translation, has, had, preached, below, in, the, church, tradition, section, the, hoole, translation, has, having, become, a, herald, john, chrysostom, indicated, that, paul, preached, in, spain, for, after, he, had, been, in, rome, he, returned, to, spain, but, whether, he, came, thence, again, into, these, parts, we, know, not, cyril, of, jerusalem, said, that, paul, fully, preached, the, gospel, and, instructed, even, imperial, rome, and, carried, the, earnestness, of, his, preaching, as, far, as, spain, undergoing, conflicts, innumerable, and, performing, signs, and, wonders, the, muratorian, fragment, mentions, the, departure, of, paul, from, the, city, 39, when, he, journeyed, to, spain, the, following, table, is, adapted, from, the, book, from, jesus, to, christianity, by, biblical, scholar, l, michael, white, matching, paul, s, travels, as, documented, in, the, acts, and, the, travels, in, his, epistles, but, not, agreed, upon, fully, by, all, biblical, scholars, in, 57, ad, upon, completion, of, his, third, missionary, journey, paul, arrived, in, jerusalem, for, his, fifth, and, final, visit, with, a, collection, of, money, for, the, local, community, the, acts, of, the, apostles, reports, that, initially, he, was, warmly, received, however, acts, goes, on, to, recount, how, paul, was, warned, by, james, and, the, elders, that, he, was, gaining, a, reputation, for, being, against, the, law, saying, they, have, been, told, about, you, that, you, teach, all, the, jews, living, among, the, gentiles, to, forsake, moses, and, that, you, tell, them, not, to, circumcise, their, children, or, observe, the, customs, paul, underwent, a, purification, ritual, so, that, all, will, know, that, there, is, nothing, in, what, they, have, been, told, about, you, but, that, you, yourself, observe, and, guard, the, law, when, the, seven, days, of, the, purification, ritual, were, almost, completed, some, jews, from, asia, most, likely, from, roman, asia, accused, paul, of, defiling, the, temple, by, bringing, gentiles, into, it, he, was, seized, and, dragged, out, of, the, temple, by, an, angry, mob, when, the, tribune, heard, of, the, uproar, he, and, some, centurions, and, soldiers, rushed, to, the, area, unable, to, determine, his, identity, and, the, cause, of, the, uproar, they, placed, him, in, chains, he, was, about, to, be, taken, into, the, barracks, when, he, asked, to, speak, to, the, people, he, was, given, permission, by, the, romans, and, proceeded, to, tell, his, story, after, a, while, the, crowd, responded, up, to, this, point, they, listened, to, him, but, then, they, shouted, away, with, such, a, fellow, from, the, earth, for, he, should, not, be, allowed, to, live, the, tribune, ordered, that, paul, be, brought, into, the, barracks, and, interrogated, under, flogging, paul, asserted, his, roman, citizenship, which, would, prevent, his, flogging, the, tribune, wanted, to, find, out, what, paul, was, being, accused, of, by, the, angry, jerusalemites, the, next, day, he, released, him, and, ordered, the, chief, priests, and, the, entire, council, to, meet, paul, spoke, before, the, council, and, caused, a, disagreement, between, the, pharisees, and, the, sadducees, when, this, threatened, to, turn, violent, the, tribune, ordered, his, soldiers, to, take, paul, by, force, and, return, him, to, the, barracks, the, next, morning, 40, jews, bound, themselves, by, an, oath, neither, to, eat, nor, drink, until, they, had, killed, paul, but, the, son, of, paul, s, sister, heard, of, the, plot, and, notified, paul, who, notified, the, tribune, that, the, conspiracists, were, going, to, ambush, him, the, tribune, ordered, two, centurions, to, get, ready, to, leave, by, nine, o, clock, tonight, for, caesarea, with, two, hundred, soldiers, seventy, horsemen, and, two, hundred, spearmen, also, provide, mounts, for, paul, to, ride, and, take, him, safely, to, felix, the, governor, paul, was, taken, to, caesarea, where, the, governor, ordered, that, he, be, kept, under, guard, in, herod, s, headquarters, five, days, later, the, high, priest, ananias, came, down, with, some, elders, and, an, attorney, a, certain, tertullus, and, they, reported, their, case, against, paul, to, the, governor, both, paul, and, the, jewish, authorities, gave, a, statement, but, felix, who, was, rather, well, informed, about, the, way, adjourned, the, hearing, with, the, comment, when, lysias, the, tribune, comes, down, i, will, decide, your, case, marcus, antonius, felix, then, ordered, the, centurion, to, keep, paul, in, custody, but, to, let, him, have, some, liberty, and, not, to, prevent, any, of, his, friends, from, taking, care, of, his, needs, he, was, held, there, for, two, years, by, felix, until, a, new, governor, porcius, festus, was, appointed, the, chief, priests, and, the, leaders, of, the, jews, requested, that, festus, return, paul, to, jerusalem, after, festus, had, stayed, in, jerusalem, not, more, than, eight, or, ten, days, he, went, down, to, caesarea, the, next, day, he, took, his, seat, on, the, tribunal, and, ordered, paul, to, be, brought, when, festus, suggested, that, he, be, sent, back, to, jerusalem, for, further, trial, paul, exercised, his, right, as, a, roman, citizen, to, appeal, unto, caesar, finally, paul, and, his, companions, sailed, for, rome, where, paul, was, to, stand, trial, for, his, alleged, crimes, acts, recounts, that, on, the, way, to, rome, for, his, appeal, as, a, roman, citizen, to, caesar, paul, was, shipwrecked, on, melita, which, is, present, day, malta, where, the, islanders, showed, him, unusual, kindness, and, where, he, was, met, by, publius, from, malta, he, travelled, to, rome, via, syracuse, rhegium, and, puteoli, paul, finally, arrived, in, rome, c, 60, ad, where, he, spent, another, two, years, under, house, arrest, according, to, the, traditional, account, the, narrative, of, acts, ends, with, paul, preaching, in, rome, for, two, years, from, his, rented, home, while, awaiting, trial, irenaeus, wrote, in, the, 2nd, century, that, peter, and, paul, had, been, the, founders, of, the, church, in, rome, and, had, appointed, linus, as, succeeding, bishop, however, paul, was, not, a, bishop, of, rome, nor, did, he, bring, christianity, to, rome, since, there, were, already, christians, in, rome, when, he, arrived, there, paul, also, wrote, his, letter, to, the, church, at, rome, before, he, had, visited, rome, paul, only, played, a, supporting, part, in, the, life, of, the, church, in, rome, paul, s, death, is, believed, to, have, occurred, after, the, great, fire, of, rome, in, july, 64, ad, but, before, the, last, year, of, nero, s, reign, in, 68, ad, pope, clement, i, writes, in, his, epistle, to, the, corinthians, that, after, paul, had, borne, his, testimony, before, the, rulers, he, departed, from, the, world, and, went, unto, the, holy, place, having, been, found, a, notable, pattern, of, patient, endurance, ignatius, of, antioch, writes, in, his, epistle, to, the, ephesians, that, paul, was, martyred, without, giving, any, further, information, tertullian, writes, that, paul, was, crowned, with, an, exit, like, john, paulus, ioannis, exitu, coronatur, although, it, is, unclear, which, john, he, meant, eusebius, states, that, paul, was, killed, during, the, neronian, persecution, and, quoting, from, dionysius, of, corinth, argues, that, peter, and, paul, were, martyred, at, the, same, time, this, is, also, reported, by, sulpicius, severus, who, claimed, peter, was, crucified, while, paul, was, beheaded, john, chrysostom, provides, an, account, of, nero, imprisoning, paul, but, not, of, his, execution, and, no, mention, of, peter, lactantius, only, mentioned, who, first, persecuted, the, servants, of, god, he, crucified, peter, and, slew, paul, paulum, interfecit, based, on, the, letters, attributed, to, paul, jerome, claims, paul, was, imprisoned, by, nero, in, the, twenty, fifth, year, after, our, lord, s, passion, post, passionem, domini, vicesimo, quinto, anno, that, is, the, second, of, nero, id, est, secundo, neronis, at, the, time, when, festus, procurator, of, judea, succeeded, felix, he, was, sent, bound, to, rome, remaining, for, two, years, in, free, custody, jerome, interpreted, the, second, epistle, to, timothy, to, indicate, that, paul, was, dismissed, by, nero, paulum, a, nerone, dimissum, that, the, gospel, of, christ, might, be, preached, also, in, the, west, but, in, the, fourteenth, year, of, nero, quarto, decimo, neronis, anno, on, the, same, day, with, peter, was, beheaded, at, rome, for, christ, s, sake, and, was, buried, in, the, ostian, way, the, thirty, seventh, year, after, our, lord, s, passion, anno, post, passionem, domini, tricesimo, septimo, a, legend, later, developed, that, his, martyrdom, occurred, at, the, aquae, salviae, on, the, via, laurentina, according, to, this, legend, after, paul, was, decapitated, his, severed, head, rebounded, three, times, giving, rise, to, a, source, of, water, each, time, that, it, touched, the, ground, which, is, how, the, place, earned, the, name, san, paolo, alle, tre, fontane, st, paul, at, the, three, fountains, the, apocryphal, acts, of, paul, also, describe, the, martyrdom, and, the, burial, of, paul, but, their, narrative, is, highly, fanciful, and, largely, unhistorical, according, to, the, liber, pontificalis, paul, s, body, was, buried, outside, the, walls, of, rome, at, the, second, mile, on, the, via, ostiensis, on, the, estate, owned, by, a, christian, woman, named, lucina, it, was, here, in, the, fourth, century, that, the, emperor, constantine, the, great, built, a, first, church, then, between, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, it, was, considerably, enlarged, by, the, emperors, valentinian, i, valentinian, ii, theodosius, i, and, arcadius, the, present, day, basilica, of, saint, paul, outside, the, walls, was, built, there, in, the, early, 19th, century, caius, in, his, disputation, against, proclus, 198, ad, mentions, this, of, the, places, in, which, the, remains, of, the, apostles, peter, and, paul, were, deposited, i, can, point, out, the, trophies, of, the, apostles, for, if, you, are, willing, to, go, to, the, vatican, or, to, the, ostian, way, you, will, find, the, trophies, of, those, who, founded, this, church, writing, on, paul, s, biography, jerome, in, his, de, viris, illustribus, in, 392, ad, mentions, that, paul, was, buried, in, the, ostian, way, at, rome, in, 2002, an, 8, foot, 2, 4, m, long, marble, sarcophagus, inscribed, with, the, words, paulo, apostolo, mart, which, translates, as, paul, apostle, martyr, was, discovered, during, excavations, around, the, basilica, of, saint, paul, outside, the, walls, on, the, via, ostiensis, vatican, archaeologists, declared, this, to, be, the, tomb, of, paul, the, apostle, in, december, 2006, the, excavation, having, been, completed, in, november, in, the, early, 2000s, vatican, archaeologists, conducted, excavations, to, make, the, tomb, more, accessible, to, pilgrims, these, excavations, confirmed, the, presence, of, a, white, marble, sarcophagus, beneath, the, altar, the, sarcophagus, was, not, removed, but, a, window, was, created, to, allow, visitors, to, view, it, in, 2009, pope, benedict, xvi, announced, that, radiocarbon, dating, of, bone, fragments, found, in, the, sarcophagus, indicated, they, were, from, the, 1st, or, 2nd, century, aligning, with, the, traditional, timeline, of, paul, s, life, this, discovery, along, with, other, artifacts, such, as, a, piece, of, purple, linen, laminated, with, pure, gold, grains, of, incense, and, blue, blue, texiles, with, linen, filaments, all, support, the, hypothesis, that, the, remains, are, indeed, those, of, saint, paul, the, vatican, also, confirmed, that, it, had, discovered, and, restored, the, earliest, known, image, of, saint, paul, dating, to, the, early, 4th, century, ad, in, the, catacomb, of, saint, thekla, close, to, the, basilica, of, st, paul, outside, the, walls, in, rome, in, 2010, it, was, revealed, that, this, icon, painted, on, the, ceiling, of, a, catacomb, was, adjacent, to, the, oldest, known, depictions, of, saint, peter, saint, john, and, saint, andrew, surrounding, an, imge, of, christ, as, the, good, shepherd, various, christian, writers, have, suggested, more, details, about, paul, s, life, 1, clement, a, letter, written, by, the, roman, bishop, clement, of, rome, around, the, year, 90, reports, this, about, paul, by, reason, of, jealousy, and, strife, paul, by, his, example, pointed, out, the, prize, of, patient, endurance, after, that, he, had, been, seven, times, in, bonds, had, been, driven, into, exile, had, been, stoned, had, preached, in, the, east, and, in, the, west, he, won, the, noble, renown, which, was, the, reward, of, his, faith, having, taught, righteousness, unto, the, whole, world, and, having, reached, the, farthest, bounds, of, the, west, and, when, he, had, borne, his, testimony, before, the, rulers, so, he, departed, from, the, world, and, went, unto, the, holy, place, having, been, found, a, notable, pattern, of, patient, endurance, commenting, on, this, passage, raymond, brown, writes, that, while, it, does, not, explicitly, say, that, paul, was, martyred, in, rome, such, a, martyrdom, is, the, most, reasonable, interpretation, eusebius, of, caesarea, who, wrote, in, the, 4th, century, states, that, paul, was, beheaded, in, the, reign, of, the, roman, emperor, nero, this, event, has, been, dated, either, to, the, year, 64, ad, when, rome, was, devastated, by, a, fire, or, a, few, years, later, to, 67, ad, according, to, one, tradition, the, church, of, san, paolo, alle, tre, fontane, marks, the, place, of, paul, s, execution, a, roman, catholic, liturgical, solemnity, of, peter, and, paul, celebrated, on, 29, june, commemorates, his, martyrdom, and, reflects, a, tradition, preserved, by, eusebius, that, peter, and, paul, were, martyred, at, the, same, time, the, roman, liturgical, calendar, for, the, following, day, now, remembers, all, christians, martyred, in, these, early, persecutions, formerly, 30, june, was, the, feast, day, for, st, paul, persons, or, religious, orders, with, a, special, affinity, for, st, paul, can, still, celebrate, their, patron, on, 30, june, the, apocryphal, acts, of, paul, and, the, apocryphal, acts, of, peter, suggest, that, paul, survived, rome, and, traveled, further, west, some, think, that, paul, could, have, revisited, greece, and, asia, minor, after, his, trip, to, spain, and, might, then, have, been, arrested, in, troas, and, taken, to, rome, and, executed, a, tradition, holds, that, paul, was, interred, with, saint, peter, ad, catacumbas, by, the, via, appia, until, moved, to, what, is, now, the, basilica, of, saint, paul, outside, the, walls, in, rome, bede, in, his, ecclesiastical, history, writes, that, pope, vitalian, in, 665, gave, paul, s, relics, including, a, cross, made, from, his, prison, chains, from, the, crypts, of, lucina, to, king, oswy, of, northumbria, northern, britain, the, skull, of, saint, paul, is, claimed, to, reside, in, the, archbasilica, of, saint, john, lateran, since, at, least, the, ninth, century, alongside, the, skull, of, saint, peter, the, feast, of, the, conversion, of, saint, paul, is, celebrated, on, 25, january, the, roman, martyrology, commemorates, paul, with, a, feast, celebrating, his, conversion, on, 25, january, the, roman, martyrology, also, commemorates, paul, and, peter, with, a, solemnity, on, 29, june, the, eastern, orthodox, church, has, several, fixed, days, for, the, commemoration, of, paul, the, eastern, orthodox, church, also, has, numerous, non, fixed, days, for, the, veneration, of, paul, the, church, of, england, celebrates, the, conversion, of, saint, paul, on, 25, january, as, a, festival, furthermore, along, with, saint, peter, paul, is, remembered, by, the, church, of, england, with, a, festival, on, 29, june, the, lutheran, church, missouri, synod, has, two, festivals, for, saint, paul, the, first, being, his, conversion, on, 25, january, and, the, second, being, for, saints, peter, and, paul, on, 29, june, paul, is, the, patron, saint, of, several, locations, he, is, the, patron, saint, of, the, island, of, malta, which, celebrates, paul, s, arrival, to, the, island, via, shipwreck, on, 10, february, this, day, is, a, public, holiday, on, the, island, paul, is, also, considered, to, be, the, patron, saint, of, the, city, of, london, the, new, testament, offers, little, if, any, information, about, the, physical, appearance, of, paul, but, several, descriptions, can, be, found, in, apocryphal, texts, in, the, acts, of, paul, he, is, described, as, a, man, of, small, stature, with, a, bald, head, and, crooked, legs, in, a, good, state, of, body, with, eyebrows, meeting, and, nose, somewhat, hooked, in, the, latin, version, of, the, acts, of, paul, and, thecla, it, is, added, that, he, had, a, red, florid, face, in, the, history, of, the, contending, of, saint, paul, his, countenance, is, described, as, ruddy, with, the, ruddiness, of, the, skin, of, the, pomegranate, the, acts, of, saint, peter, confirms, that, paul, had, a, bald, and, shining, head, with, red, hair, as, summarised, by, barnes, chrysostom, records, that, paul, s, stature, was, low, his, body, crooked, and, his, head, bald, lucian, in, his, philopatris, describes, paul, as, corpore, erat, parvo, contracto, incurvo, tricubitali, he, was, small, contracted, crooked, of, three, cubits, or, four, feet, six, nicephorus, claims, that, paul, was, a, little, man, crooked, and, almost, bent, like, a, bow, with, a, pale, countenance, long, and, wrinkled, and, a, bald, head, pseudo, chrysostom, echoes, lucian, s, height, of, paul, referring, to, him, as, the, man, of, three, cubits, of, the, 27, books, in, the, new, testament, 13, identify, paul, as, the, author, seven, of, these, are, widely, considered, authentic, and, paul, s, own, while, the, authorship, of, the, other, six, is, disputed, the, undisputed, letters, are, considered, the, most, important, sources, since, they, contain, what, is, widely, agreed, to, be, paul, s, own, statements, about, his, life, and, thoughts, theologian, mark, powell, writes, that, paul, directed, these, seven, letters, to, specific, occasions, at, particular, churches, as, an, example, if, the, corinthian, church, had, not, experienced, problems, concerning, its, celebration, of, the, lord, s, supper, today, it, would, not, be, known, that, paul, even, believed, in, that, observance, or, had, any, opinions, about, it, one, way, or, the, other, powell, comments, that, there, may, be, other, matters, in, the, early, church, that, have, since, gone, unnoticed, simply, because, no, crises, arose, that, prompted, paul, to, comment, on, them, in, paul, s, writings, he, provides, the, first, written, account, of, what, it, is, to, be, a, christian, and, thus, a, description, of, christian, spirituality, his, letters, have, been, characterized, as, being, the, most, influential, books, of, the, new, testament, after, the, gospels, of, matthew, and, john, paul, s, authentic, letters, are, roughly, dated, to, the, years, surrounding, the, mid, 1st, century, placing, paul, in, this, time, period, is, done, on, the, basis, of, his, reported, conflicts, with, other, early, contemporary, figures, in, the, jesus, movement, including, james, and, peter, the, references, to, paul, and, his, letters, by, clement, of, rome, writing, in, the, late, 1st, century, his, reported, issues, in, damascus, from, 2, corinthians, 11, 32, which, he, says, took, place, while, king, aretas, iv, was, in, power, a, possible, reference, to, erastus, of, corinth, in, romans, 16, 23, his, reference, to, preaching, in, the, province, of, illyricum, which, dissolved, in, 80, ad, the, lack, of, any, references, to, the, gospels, indicating, a, pre, war, time, period, the, chronology, in, the, acts, of, the, apostles, placing, paul, in, this, time, and, the, dependence, on, paul, s, letters, by, other, 1st, century, pseudo, pauline, epistles, seven, of, the, 13, letters, that, bear, paul, s, name, romans, 1, corinthians, 2, corinthians, galatians, philippians, 1, thessalonians, and, philemon, are, almost, universally, accepted, as, being, entirely, authentic, and, dictated, by, paul, himself, they, are, considered, the, best, source, of, information, on, paul, s, life, and, especially, his, thought, four, of, the, letters, ephesians, 1, and, 2, timothy, and, titus, are, widely, considered, pseudepigraphical, while, the, authorship, of, the, other, two, is, subject, to, debate, colossians, and, 2, thessalonians, are, possibly, deutero, pauline, meaning, they, may, have, been, written, by, paul, s, followers, after, his, death, similarly, 1, timothy, 2, timothy, and, titus, may, be, trito, pauline, meaning, they, may, have, been, written, by, members, of, the, pauline, school, a, generation, after, his, death, according, to, their, theories, these, disputed, letters, may, have, come, from, followers, writing, in, paul, s, name, often, using, material, from, his, surviving, letters, these, scribes, also, may, have, had, access, to, letters, written, by, paul, that, no, longer, survive, the, authenticity, of, colossians, has, been, questioned, on, the, grounds, that, it, contains, an, otherwise, unparalleled, description, among, his, writings, of, jesus, as, the, image, of, the, invisible, god, a, christology, found, elsewhere, only, in, the, gospel, of, john, however, the, personal, notes, in, the, letter, connect, it, to, philemon, unquestionably, the, work, of, paul, internal, evidence, shows, close, connection, with, philippians, ephesians, is, a, letter, that, is, very, similar, to, colossians, but, is, almost, entirely, lacking, in, personal, reminiscences, its, style, is, unique, it, lacks, the, emphasis, on, the, cross, to, be, found, in, other, pauline, writings, reference, to, the, second, coming, is, missing, and, christian, marriage, is, exalted, in, a, way, that, contrasts, with, the, reference, in, 1, corinthians, finally, according, to, r, e, brown, it, exalts, the, church, in, a, way, suggestive, of, the, second, generation, of, christians, built, upon, the, foundation, of, the, apostles, and, prophets, now, past, the, defenders, of, its, pauline, authorship, argue, that, it, was, intended, to, be, read, by, a, number, of, different, churches, and, that, it, marks, the, final, stage, of, the, development, of, paul, s, thinking, it, has, been, said, too, that, the, moral, portion, of, the, epistle, consisting, of, the, last, two, chapters, has, the, closest, affinity, with, similar, portions, of, other, epistles, while, the, whole, admirably, fits, in, with, the, known, details, of, paul, s, life, and, throws, considerable, light, upon, them, three, main, reasons, have, been, advanced, by, those, who, question, paul, s, authorship, of, 1, timothy, 2, timothy, and, titus, also, known, as, the, pastoral, epistles, although, approximately, half, of, the, acts, of, the, apostles, deals, with, paul, s, life, and, works, acts, does, not, refer, to, paul, writing, letters, historians, believe, that, the, author, of, acts, did, not, have, access, to, any, of, paul, s, letters, one, piece, of, evidence, suggesting, this, is, that, acts, never, directly, quotes, from, the, pauline, epistles, discrepancies, between, the, pauline, epistles, and, acts, would, further, support, the, conclusion, that, the, author, of, acts, did, not, have, access, to, those, epistles, when, composing, acts, british, jewish, scholar, hyam, maccoby, contended, that, paul, as, described, in, the, acts, of, the, apostles, is, quite, different, from, the, view, of, paul, gleaned, from, his, own, writings, some, difficulties, have, been, noted, in, the, account, of, his, life, paul, as, described, in, the, acts, of, the, apostles, is, much, more, interested, in, factual, history, less, in, theology, ideas, such, as, justification, by, faith, are, absent, as, are, references, to, the, spirit, according, to, maccoby, he, also, pointed, out, that, there, are, no, references, to, john, the, baptist, in, the, pauline, epistles, although, paul, mentions, him, several, times, in, the, acts, of, the, apostles, others, have, objected, that, the, language, of, the, speeches, is, too, lukan, in, style, to, reflect, anyone, else, s, words, moreover, george, shillington, writes, that, the, author, of, acts, most, likely, created, the, speeches, accordingly, and, they, bear, his, literary, and, theological, marks, conversely, howard, marshall, writes, that, the, speeches, were, not, entirely, the, inventions, of, the, author, and, while, they, may, not, be, accurate, word, for, word, the, author, nevertheless, records, the, general, idea, of, them, f, c, baur, 1792, 1860, professor, of, theology, at, t, bingen, in, germany, the, first, scholar, to, critique, acts, and, the, pauline, epistles, and, founder, of, the, t, bingen, school, of, theology, argued, that, paul, as, the, apostle, to, the, gentiles, was, in, violent, opposition, to, the, original, 12, apostles, baur, considers, the, acts, of, the, apostles, were, late, and, unreliable, this, debate, has, continued, ever, since, with, adolf, deissmann, 1866, 1937, and, richard, reitzenstein, 1861, 1931, emphasising, paul, s, greek, inheritance, and, albert, schweitzer, stressing, his, dependence, on, judaism, in, the, opening, verses, of, romans, 1, paul, provides, a, litany, of, his, own, apostolic, appointment, to, preach, among, the, gentiles, and, his, post, conversion, convictions, about, the, risen, christ, paul, described, himself, as, set, apart, for, the, gospel, of, god, and, called, to, be, an, apostle, and, a, servant, of, jesus, christ, jesus, had, revealed, himself, to, paul, just, as, he, had, appeared, to, peter, to, james, and, to, the, twelve, disciples, after, his, resurrection, paul, experienced, this, as, an, unforeseen, sudden, startling, change, due, to, all, powerful, grace, not, as, the, fruit, of, his, reasoning, or, thoughts, paul, also, describes, himself, as, afflicted, with, a, thorn, in, the, flesh, the, nature, of, this, thorn, is, unknown, there, are, debates, as, to, whether, paul, understood, himself, as, commissioned, to, take, the, gospel, to, the, gentiles, at, the, moment, of, his, conversion, before, his, conversion, he, believed, his, persecution, of, the, church, to, be, an, indication, of, his, zeal, for, his, religion, after, his, conversion, he, believed, jewish, hostility, toward, the, church, was, sinful, opposition, that, would, incur, god, s, wrath, paul, believed, he, was, halted, by, christ, when, his, fury, was, at, its, height, it, was, through, zeal, that, he, persecuted, the, church, and, he, obtained, mercy, because, he, had, acted, ignorantly, in, unbelief, paul, s, writings, emphasized, the, crucifixion, christ, s, resurrection, and, the, parousia, or, second, coming, of, christ, paul, saw, jesus, as, lord, kyrios, the, true, messiah, and, the, son, of, god, who, was, promised, by, god, beforehand, through, his, prophets, in, the, holy, scriptures, while, being, a, biological, descendant, from, david, according, to, the, flesh, he, was, declared, to, be, the, son, of, god, by, his, resurrection, from, the, dead, according, to, e, p, sanders, paul, preached, the, death, resurrection, and, lordship, of, jesus, christ, and, he, proclaimed, that, faith, in, jesus, guarantees, a, share, in, his, life, in, paul, s, view, jesus, death, was, not, a, defeat, but, was, for, the, believers, benefit, a, sacrifice, which, substitutes, for, the, lives, of, others, and, frees, them, from, the, bondage, of, sin, believers, participate, in, christ, s, death, and, resurrection, by, their, baptism, the, resurrection, of, jesus, was, of, primary, importance, to, paul, bringing, the, promise, of, salvation, to, believers, paul, taught, that, when, christ, returned, those, who, died, in, christ, would, be, raised, when, he, returned, while, those, still, alive, would, be, caught, up, in, the, clouds, together, with, them, to, meet, the, lord, in, the, air, sanders, concludes, that, paul, s, writings, reveal, what, he, calls, the, essence, of, the, christian, message, 1, god, sent, his, son, 2, the, son, was, crucified, and, resurrected, for, the, benefit, of, humanity, 3, the, son, would, soon, return, and, 4, those, who, belonged, to, the, son, would, live, with, him, forever, paul, s, gospel, like, those, of, others, also, included, 5, the, admonition, to, live, by, the, highest, moral, standard, may, your, spirit, and, soul, and, body, be, kept, sound, and, blameless, at, the, coming, of, our, lord, jesus, christ, in, paul, s, writings, the, public, corporate, devotional, patterns, towards, jesus, in, the, early, christian, community, are, reflective, of, paul, s, perspective, on, the, divine, status, of, jesus, in, what, scholars, have, termed, a, binitarian, pattern, of, devotion, for, paul, jesus, receives, prayer, the, presence, of, jesus, is, confessionally, invoked, by, believers, people, are, baptized, in, jesus, name, jesus, is, the, reference, in, christian, fellowship, for, a, religious, ritual, meal, the, lord, s, supper, in, pagan, cults, the, reference, for, ritual, meals, is, always, to, a, deity, and, jesus, is, the, source, of, continuing, prophetic, oracles, to, believers, paul, taught, that, christians, are, redeemed, from, sin, by, jesus, death, and, resurrection, his, death, was, an, expiation, as, well, as, a, propitiation, and, by, christ, s, blood, peace, is, made, between, god, and, man, by, grace, through, faith, a, christian, shares, in, jesus, death, and, in, his, victory, over, death, gaining, as, a, free, gift, a, new, justified, status, of, sonship, according, to, krister, stendahl, the, main, concern, of, paul, s, writings, on, jesus, role, and, salvation, by, faith, is, not, the, individual, conscience, of, human, sinners, and, their, doubts, about, being, chosen, by, god, or, not, but, the, problem, of, the, inclusion, of, gentile, greek, torah, observers, into, god, s, covenant, dying, for, our, sins, refers, to, the, problem, of, gentile, torah, observers, who, despite, their, faithfulness, cannot, fully, observe, commandments, including, circumcision, and, are, therefore, sinners, excluded, from, god, s, covenant, jesus, death, and, resurrection, solved, this, problem, of, the, exclusion, of, the, gentiles, from, god, s, covenant, as, indicated, by, romans, 3, 21, 26, paul, s, conversion, fundamentally, changed, his, basic, beliefs, regarding, god, s, covenant, and, the, inclusion, of, gentiles, into, this, covenant, paul, believed, jesus, death, was, a, voluntary, sacrifice, that, reconciled, sinners, with, god, the, law, only, reveals, the, extent, of, people, s, enslavement, to, the, power, of, sin, a, power, that, must, be, broken, by, christ, before, his, conversion, paul, believed, gentiles, were, outside, the, covenant, that, god, made, with, israel, after, his, conversion, he, believed, gentiles, and, jews, were, united, as, the, people, of, god, in, christ, before, his, conversion, he, believed, circumcision, was, the, rite, through, which, males, became, part, of, israel, an, exclusive, community, of, god, s, chosen, people, after, his, conversion, he, believed, that, neither, circumcision, nor, uncircumcision, means, anything, but, that, the, new, creation, is, what, counts, in, the, sight, of, god, and, that, this, new, creation, is, a, work, of, christ, in, the, life, of, believers, making, them, part, of, the, church, an, inclusive, community, of, jews, and, gentiles, reconciled, with, god, through, faith, according, to, e, p, sanders, who, initiated, the, new, perspective, on, paul, with, his, 1977, publication, paul, and, palestinian, judaism, paul, saw, the, faithful, redeemed, by, participation, in, jesus, death, and, rising, though, jesus, death, substituted, for, that, of, others, and, thereby, freed, believers, from, sin, and, guilt, a, metaphor, derived, from, ancient, sacrificial, theology, the, essence, of, paul, s, writing, is, not, in, the, legal, terms, regarding, the, expiation, of, sin, but, the, act, of, participation, in, christ, through, dying, and, rising, with, him, according, to, sanders, those, who, are, baptized, into, christ, are, baptized, into, his, death, and, thus, they, escape, the, power, of, sin, he, died, so, that, the, believers, may, die, with, him, and, consequently, live, with, him, by, this, participation, in, christ, s, death, and, rising, one, receives, forgiveness, for, past, offences, is, liberated, from, the, powers, of, sin, and, receives, the, spirit, some, scholars, see, paul, as, completely, in, line, with, 1st, century, judaism, a, pharisee, and, student, of, gamaliel, as, presented, by, acts, others, see, him, as, opposed, to, 1st, century, judaism, see, marcionism, while, the, majority, see, him, as, somewhere, in, between, these, two, extremes, opposed, to, insistence, on, keeping, the, ritual, laws, for, example, the, circumcision, controversy, in, early, christianity, as, necessary, for, entrance, into, god, s, new, covenant, but, in, full, agreement, on, divine, law, these, views, of, paul, are, paralleled, by, the, views, of, biblical, law, in, christianity, paul, redefined, the, people, of, israel, those, he, calls, the, true, israel, and, the, true, circumcision, as, those, who, had, faith, in, the, heavenly, christ, thus, excluding, those, he, called, israel, after, the, flesh, from, his, new, covenant, he, also, held, the, view, that, the, torah, given, to, moses, was, valid, until, christ, came, so, that, even, jews, are, no, longer, under, the, torah, nor, obligated, to, follow, the, commandments, or, mitzvot, as, given, to, moses, tabor, 2013, paul, is, critical, both, theologically, and, empirically, of, claims, of, moral, or, lineal, superiority, of, jews, while, conversely, strongly, sustaining, the, notion, of, a, special, place, for, the, children, of, israel, paul, s, theology, of, the, gospel, accelerated, the, separation, of, the, messianic, sect, of, christians, from, judaism, a, development, contrary, to, paul, s, own, intent, he, wrote, that, faith, in, christ, was, alone, decisive, in, salvation, for, jews, and, gentiles, alike, making, the, schism, between, the, followers, of, christ, and, mainstream, jews, inevitable, and, permanent, he, argued, that, gentile, converts, did, not, need, to, become, jews, get, circumcised, follow, jewish, dietary, restrictions, or, otherwise, observe, mosaic, laws, to, be, saved, according, to, paula, fredriksen, paul, s, opposition, to, male, circumcision, for, gentiles, is, in, line, with, old, testament, predictions, that, in, the, last, days, the, gentile, nations, would, come, to, the, god, of, israel, as, gentiles, e, g, zechariah, 8, 20, 23, not, as, proselytes, to, israel, for, paul, gentile, male, circumcision, was, therefore, an, affront, to, god, s, intentions, according, to, hurtado, paul, saw, himself, as, what, munck, called, a, salvation, historical, figure, in, his, own, right, who, was, personally, and, singularly, deputized, by, god, to, bring, about, the, predicted, ingathering, the, fullness, of, the, nations, according, to, sanders, paul, insists, that, salvation, is, received, by, the, grace, of, god, according, to, sanders, this, insistence, is, in, line, with, judaism, of, c, 200, bc, until, 200, ad, which, saw, god, s, covenant, with, israel, as, an, act, of, grace, of, god, observance, of, the, law, is, needed, to, maintain, the, covenant, but, the, covenant, is, not, earned, by, observing, the, law, but, by, the, grace, of, god, sanders, publications, have, since, been, taken, up, by, professor, james, dunn, who, coined, the, phrase, the, new, perspective, on, paul, n, t, wright, the, anglican, bishop, of, durham, notes, a, difference, in, emphasis, between, galatians, and, romans, the, latter, being, much, more, positive, about, the, continuing, covenant, between, god, and, his, ancient, people, than, the, former, wright, also, contends, that, performing, christian, works, is, not, insignificant, but, rather, proof, of, having, attained, the, redemption, of, jesus, christ, by, grace, free, gift, received, by, faith, he, concludes, that, paul, distinguishes, between, performing, christian, works, which, are, signs, of, ethnic, identity, and, others, which, are, a, sign, of, obedience, to, christ, according, to, bart, ehrman, paul, believed, that, jesus, would, return, within, his, lifetime, n, t, wright, argues, that, paul, s, eschatology, did, not, remain, static, however, developing, in, his, later, epistles, the, idea, that, he, would, probably, not, see, the, second, coming, in, his, lifetime, wright, also, argues, that, this, shift, was, due, to, perspective, and, not, belief, paul, expected, that, christians, who, had, died, in, the, meantime, would, be, resurrected, to, share, in, god, s, kingdom, and, he, believed, that, the, saved, would, be, transformed, assuming, heavenly, imperishable, bodies, paul, s, teaching, about, the, end, of, the, world, is, expressed, most, clearly, in, his, first, and, second, letters, to, the, christian, community, of, thessalonica, he, assures, them, that, the, dead, will, rise, first, and, be, followed, by, those, left, alive, this, suggests, an, imminent, end, but, he, is, unspecific, about, times, and, seasons, and, encourages, his, hearers, to, expect, a, delay, the, form, of, the, end, will, be, a, battle, between, jesus, and, the, man, of, lawlessness, whose, conclusion, is, the, triumph, of, christ, before, his, conversion, he, believed, god, s, messiah, would, put, an, end, to, the, old, age, of, evil, and, initiate, a, new, age, of, righteousness, after, his, conversion, he, believed, this, would, happen, in, stages, that, had, begun, with, the, resurrection, of, jesus, but, the, old, age, would, continue, until, jesus, returns, the, second, chapter, of, the, first, letter, to, timothy, one, of, the, six, disputed, letters, is, used, by, many, churches, to, deny, women, a, vote, in, church, affairs, reject, women, from, serving, as, teachers, of, adult, bible, classes, prevent, them, from, serving, as, missionaries, and, generally, disenfranchise, women, from, the, duties, and, privileges, of, church, leadership, 9, in, like, manner, also, that, women, adorn, themselves, in, modest, apparel, with, shamefacedness, and, sobriety, not, with, broided, hair, or, gold, or, pearls, or, costly, array, 10, but, which, becometh, women, professing, godliness, with, good, works, 11, let, the, woman, learn, in, silence, with, all, subjection, 12, but, i, suffer, not, a, woman, to, teach, nor, to, usurp, authority, over, the, man, but, to, be, in, silence, 13, for, adam, was, first, formed, then, eve, 14, and, adam, was, not, deceived, but, the, woman, being, deceived, was, in, the, transgression, 15, notwithstanding, she, shall, be, saved, in, childbearing, if, they, continue, in, faith, and, charity, and, holiness, with, sobriety, the, king, james, bible, authorised, version, translation, of, this, passage, taken, literally, says, that, women, in, the, churches, are, to, have, no, leadership, roles, vis, vis, men, fuller, seminary, theologian, j, r, daniel, kirk, finds, evidence, in, paul, s, letters, of, a, much, more, inclusive, view, of, women, he, writes, that, romans, 16, is, a, tremendously, important, witness, to, the, important, role, of, women, in, the, early, church, paul, praises, phoebe, for, her, work, as, a, deaconess, and, junia, who, is, described, by, paul, in, scripture, as, being, respected, among, the, apostles, it, is, kirk, s, observation, that, recent, studies, suggest, that, the, passage, in, 1, corinthians, 14, ordering, women, to, be, silent, during, worship, was, a, later, addition, apparently, by, a, different, author, and, not, part, of, paul, s, original, letter, to, the, corinthians, other, scholars, such, as, giancarlo, biguzzi, believe, that, paul, s, restriction, on, women, speaking, in, 1, corinthians, 14, is, genuine, to, paul, but, applies, to, a, particular, case, where, there, were, local, problems, of, women, who, were, not, allowed, in, that, culture, to, become, educated, asking, questions, or, chatting, during, worship, services, he, does, not, believe, it, to, be, a, general, prohibition, on, any, woman, speaking, in, worship, settings, since, in, 1, corinthians, paul, affirms, the, right, responsibility, of, women, to, prophesy, biblical, prophecy, is, more, than, fore, telling, two, thirds, of, its, inscripturated, form, involves, forth, telling, that, is, setting, the, truth, justice, mercy, and, righteousness, of, god, against, the, backdrop, of, every, form, of, denial, of, the, same, thus, to, speak, prophetically, was, to, speak, boldly, against, every, form, of, moral, ethical, political, economic, and, religious, disenfranchisement, observed, in, a, culture, that, was, intent, on, building, its, own, pyramid, of, values, vis, a, vis, god, s, established, system, of, truth, and, ethics, there, were, women, prophets, in, the, highly, patriarchal, times, throughout, the, old, testament, the, most, common, term, for, prophet, in, the, old, testament, is, nabi, in, the, masculine, form, and, nebiah, in, the, hebrew, feminine, form, is, used, six, times, of, women, who, performed, the, same, task, of, receiving, and, proclaiming, the, message, given, by, god, these, women, include, miriam, aaron, and, moses, sister, deborah, the, prophet, isaiah, s, wife, and, huldah, the, one, who, interpreted, the, book, of, the, law, discovered, in, the, temple, during, the, days, of, josiah, there, were, false, prophetesses, just, as, there, were, false, prophets, the, prophetess, noadiah, was, among, those, who, tried, to, intimidate, nehemiah, apparently, they, held, equal, rank, in, prophesying, right, along, with, abraham, isaac, jacob, moses, elisha, aaron, and, samuel, kirk, s, third, example, of, a, more, inclusive, view, is, galatians, 3, 28, there, is, neither, jew, nor, gentile, neither, slave, nor, free, nor, is, there, male, and, female, for, you, are, all, one, in, christ, jesus, in, pronouncing, an, end, within, the, church, to, the, divisions, which, are, common, in, the, world, around, it, he, concludes, by, highlighting, the, fact, that, there, were, new, testament, women, who, taught, and, had, authority, in, the, early, churches, that, this, teaching, and, authority, was, sanctioned, by, paul, and, that, paul, himself, offers, a, theological, paradigm, within, which, overcoming, the, subjugation, of, women, is, an, anticipated, outcome, classicist, evelyn, stagg, and, theologian, frank, stagg, believe, that, paul, was, attempting, to, christianize, the, societal, household, or, domestic, codes, that, significantly, oppressed, women, and, empowered, men, as, the, head, of, the, household, the, staggs, present, a, serious, study, of, what, has, been, termed, the, new, testament, domestic, code, also, known, as, the, haustafel, the, two, main, passages, that, explain, these, household, duties, are, paul, s, letters, to, the, ephesians, and, to, the, colossians, an, underlying, household, code, is, also, reflected, in, four, additional, pauline, letters, and, 1, peter, 1, timothy, 2, 1ff, 8ff, 3, 1ff, 8ff, 5, 17ff, 6, 1f, titus, 2, 1, 10, and, 1, peter, biblical, scholars, have, typically, treated, the, haustafel, in, ephesians, as, a, resource, in, the, debate, over, the, role, of, women, in, ministry, and, in, the, home, margaret, macdonald, argues, that, the, haustafel, particularly, as, it, appears, in, ephesians, was, aimed, at, reducing, the, tension, between, community, members, and, outsiders, e, p, sanders, has, labeled, paul, s, remark, in, 1, corinthians, about, women, not, making, any, sound, during, worship, as, paul, s, intemperate, outburst, that, women, should, be, silent, in, the, churches, women, in, fact, played, a, very, significant, part, in, paul, s, missionary, endeavors, most, christian, traditions, say, paul, clearly, portrays, homosexuality, as, sinful, in, two, specific, locations, romans, 1, 26, 27, and, 1, corinthians, 6, 9, 10, another, passage, 1, timothy, 1, 8, 11, addresses, the, topic, more, obliquely, since, the, 19th, century, however, most, scholars, have, concluded, that, 1, timothy, along, with, 2, timothy, and, titus, is, not, original, to, paul, but, rather, an, unknown, christian, writing, in, paul, s, name, some, time, in, the, late, 1st, to, mid, 2nd, century, paul, s, influence, on, christian, thinking, arguably, has, been, more, significant, than, any, other, new, testament, author, paul, declared, that, christ, is, the, end, of, the, law, exalted, the, christian, church, as, the, body, of, christ, and, depicted, the, world, outside, the, church, as, under, judgment, paul, s, writings, include, the, earliest, reference, to, the, lord, s, supper, a, rite, traditionally, identified, as, the, christian, communion, or, eucharist, in, the, east, church, fathers, attributed, the, element, of, election, in, romans, 9, to, divine, foreknowledge, the, themes, of, predestination, found, in, western, christianity, do, not, appear, in, eastern, theology, paul, had, a, strong, influence, on, early, christianity, hurtado, notes, that, paul, regarded, his, own, christological, views, and, those, of, his, predecessors, and, that, of, the, jerusalem, church, as, essentially, similar, according, to, hurtado, this, work, against, the, claims, by, some, scholars, that, pauline, christianity, represents, a, sharp, departure, from, the, religiousness, of, judean, jesus, movements, marcionism, regarded, as, heresy, by, contemporary, mainstream, christianity, was, an, early, christian, dualist, belief, system, that, originated, in, the, teachings, of, marcion, of, sinope, at, rome, around, the, year, 144, marcion, asserted, that, paul, was, the, only, apostle, who, had, rightly, understood, the, new, message, of, salvation, as, delivered, by, christ, marcion, believed, jesus, was, the, savior, sent, by, god, and, paul, the, apostle, was, his, chief, apostle, but, he, rejected, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, god, of, israel, marcionists, believed, that, the, wrathful, hebrew, god, was, a, separate, and, lower, entity, than, the, all, forgiving, god, of, the, new, testament, in, his, account, of, his, conversion, experience, augustine, of, hippo, gave, his, life, to, christ, after, reading, romans, 13, augustine, s, foundational, work, on, the, gospel, as, a, gift, grace, on, morality, as, life, in, the, spirit, on, predestination, and, on, original, sin, all, derives, from, paul, especially, romans, in, his, account, of, his, conversion, martin, luther, wrote, about, righteousness, in, romans, 1, praising, romans, as, the, perfect, gospel, in, which, the, reformation, was, birthed, martin, luther, s, interpretation, of, paul, s, writings, influenced,

protestant, or, greek, orthodox, and, it, is, the, apostle, paul, and, his, ideas, that, are, central, in, the, hymns, the, creeds, the, sermons, the, invocation, and, benediction, and, of, course, the, rituals, of, baptism, and, the, holy, communion, or, mass, whether, birth, baptism, confirmation, marriage, or, death, it, is, predominantly, paul, who, is, evoked, to, express, meaning, and, significance, professor, james, d, tabor, for, the, huffington, post, in, his, commentary, the, epistle, to, the, romans, german, der, r, merbrief, particularly, in, the, thoroughly, re, written, second, edition, of, 1922, karl, barth, argued, that, the, god, who, is, revealed, in, the, cross, of, jesus, challenges, and, overthrows, any, attempt, to, ally, god, with, human, cultures, achievements, or, possessions, in, addition, to, the, many, questions, about, the, true, origins, of, some, of, paul, s, teachings, posed, by, historical, figures, as, noted, above, some, modern, theologians, also, hold, that, the, teachings, of, paul, differ, markedly, from, those, of, jesus, as, found, in, the, gospels, barrie, wilson, states, that, paul, differs, from, jesus, in, terms, of, the, origin, of, his, message, his, teachings, and, his, practices, some, have, even, gone, so, far, as, to, claim, that, due, to, these, apparent, differences, in, teachings, that, paul, was, actually, no, less, than, the, second, founder, of, christianity, jesus, being, its, first, as, in, the, eastern, tradition, in, general, western, humanists, interpret, the, reference, to, election, in, romans, 9, as, reflecting, divine, foreknowledge, jewish, interest, in, paul, is, a, recent, phenomenon, before, the, positive, historical, reevaluations, of, jesus, by, some, jewish, thinkers, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, he, had, hardly, featured, in, the, popular, jewish, imagination, and, little, had, been, written, about, him, by, the, religious, leaders, and, scholars, arguably, he, is, absent, from, the, talmud, and, rabbinical, literature, although, he, makes, an, appearance, in, some, variants, of, the, medieval, polemic, toledot, yeshu, as, a, particularly, effective, spy, for, the, rabbis, the, karaite, scholar, jacob, qirqisani, also, believed, that, paul, created, christianity, by, introducing, the, doctrine, of, trinitarianism, however, with, jesus, no, longer, regarded, as, the, paradigm, of, gentile, christianity, paul, s, position, became, more, important, in, jewish, historical, reconstructions, of, their, religion, s, relationship, with, christianity, he, has, featured, as, the, key, to, building, barriers, e, g, heinrich, graetz, and, martin, buber, or, bridges, e, g, isaac, mayer, wise, and, claude, g, montefiore, in, interfaith,

e, g, richard, l, rubenstein, and, daniel, boyarin, boyarin, in, particular, reads, paul, as, a, jewish, thinker, one, who, lived, and, died, convinced, he, was, a, jew, living, out, judaism, he, features, in, an, oratorio, by, felix, mendelssohn, a, painting, by, ludwig, meidner, and, a, play, by, franz, werfel, and, there, have, been, several, novels, about, paul, by, shalom, asch, and, samuel, sandmel, jewish, philosophers, including, baruch, spinoza, leo, shestov, and, jacob, taubes, and, jewish, psychoanalysts, including, sigmund, freud, and, hanns, sachs, have, engaged, with, the, apostle, as, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, in, western, thought, scholarly, surveys, of, jewish, interest, in, paul, include, those, by, hagner, 1980, pp, 143, 65, meissner, 1996, langton, 2010, langton, 2011a, pp, 55, 72, and, langton, 2011b, pp, 585, 87, in, the, 2nd, and, possibly, late, 1st, century, gnosticism, was, a, competing, religious, tradition, to, christianity, which, shared, some, elements, of, theology, elaine, pagels, concentrated, on, how, the, gnostics, interpreted, paul, s, letters, and, how, evidence, from, gnostic, sources, may, challenge, the, assumption, that, paul, wrote, his, letters, to, combat, gnostic, opponents, and, to, repudiate, their, statement, that, they, possess, secret, wisdom, in, her, reading, the, gnostics, considered, paul, as, one, of, their, own, muslims, have, long, believed, that, paul, purposefully, corrupted, the, original, revealed, teachings, of, jesus, through, the, introduction, of, such, elements, as, paganism, the, making, of, christianity, into, a, theology, of, the, cross, and, introducing, original, sin, and, the, need, for, redemption, sayf, ibn, umar, claimed, that, certain, rabbis, persuaded, paul, to, deliberately, misguide, early, christians, by, introducing, what, ibn, hazm, viewed, as, objectionable, doctrines, into, christianity, ibn, hazm, repeated, sayf, s, claims, paul, has, been, criticized, by, some, modern, muslim, thinkers, syed, muhammad, naquib, al, attas, wrote, that, paul, misrepresented, the, message, of, jesus, and, rashid, rida, accused, paul, of, introducing, shirk, polytheism, into, christianity, mohammad, ali, jouhar, quoted, adolf, von, harnack, s, critical, writings, of, paul, in, sunni, muslim, polemics, paul, plays, the, same, role, of,

supported, this, view, were, scholars, ibn, taymiyyah, who, believed, while, paul, ultimately, succeeded, ibn, saba, failed, and, ibn, hazm, who, claimed, that, the, jews, even, admitted, to, paul, s,
