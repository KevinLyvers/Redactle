muhammad, ibn, musa, al, khwarizmi, persian, c, 780, c, 850, or, simply, al, khwarizmi, was, a, khwarazm, born, polymath, who, produced, vastly, influential, arabic, language, works, in, mathematics, astronomy, and, geography, around, 820, ce, he, was, appointed, as, the, astronomer, and, head, of, the, house, of, wisdom, in, baghdad, the, contemporary, capital, city, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, his, popularizing, treatise, on, algebra, compiled, between, 813, 33, as, al, jabr, the, compendious, book, on, calculation, by, completion, and, balancing, 171, presented, the, first, systematic, solution, of, linear, and, quadratic, equations, one, of, his, achievements, in, algebra, was, his, demonstration, of, how, to, solve, quadratic, equations, by, completing, the, square, for, which, he, provided, geometric, justifications, 14, because, al, khwarizmi, was, the, first, person, to, treat, algebra, as, an, independent, discipline, and, introduced, the, methods, of, reduction, and, balancing, the, transposition, of, subtracted, terms, to, the, other, side, of, an, equation, that, is, the, cancellation, of, like, terms, on, opposite, sides, of, the, equation, he, has, been, described, as, the, father, or, founder, of, algebra, the, english, term, algebra, comes, from, the, short, hand, title, of, his, aforementioned, treatise, al, jabr, transl, completion, or, rejoining, his, name, gave, rise, to, the, english, terms, algorism, and, algorithm, the, spanish, italian, and, portuguese, terms, algoritmo, and, the, spanish, term, guarismo, and, portuguese, term, algarismo, both, meaning, digit, in, the, 12th, century, latin, language, translations, of, al, khwarizmi, s, textbook, on, indian, arithmetic, algorithmo, de, numero, indorum, which, codified, the, various, indian, numerals, introduced, the, decimal, based, positional, number, system, to, the, western, world, likewise, al, jabr, translated, into, latin, by, the, english, scholar, robert, of, chester, in, 1145, was, used, until, the, 16th, century, as, the, principal, mathematical, textbook, of, european, universities, al, khwarizmi, revised, geography, the, 2nd, century, greek, language, treatise, by, the, roman, polymath, claudius, ptolemy, listing, the, longitudes, and, latitudes, of, cities, and, localities, 9, he, further, produced, a, set, of, astronomical, tables, and, wrote, about, calendric, works, as, well, as, the, astrolabe, and, the, sundial, al, khwarizmi, made, important, contributions, to, trigonometry, producing, accurate, sine, and, cosine, tables, and, the, first, table, of, tangents, few, details, of, al, khw, rizm, s, life, are, known, with, certainty, ibn, al, nadim, gives, his, birthplace, as, khwarazm, and, he, is, generally, thought, to, have, come, from, this, region, of, persian, stock, his, name, means, of, khwarazm, a, region, that, was, part, of, greater, iran, and, is, now, part, of, turkmenistan, and, uzbekistan, al, tabari, gives, his, name, as, mu, ammad, ibn, mus, al, khw, rizm, al, maj, s, al, qu, rubbull, the, epithet, al, qutrubbulli, could, indicate, he, might, instead, have, come, from, qutrubbul, qatrabbul, near, baghdad, however, roshdi, rashed, denies, this, there, is, no, need, to, be, an, expert, on, the, period, or, a, philologist, to, see, that, al, tabari, s, second, citation, should, read, muhammad, ibn, m, sa, al, khw, rizm, and, al, maj, si, al, qutrubbulli, and, that, there, are, two, people, al, khw, rizm, and, al, maj, si, al, qutrubbulli, between, whom, the, letter, wa, has, been, omitted, in, an, early, copy, this, would, not, be, worth, mentioning, if, a, series, of, errors, concerning, the, personality, of, al, khw, rizm, occasionally, even, the, origins, of, his, knowledge, had, not, been, made, recently, g, j, toomer, with, naive, confidence, constructed, an, entire, fantasy, on, the, error, which, cannot, be, denied, the, merit, of, amusing, the, reader, on, the, other, hand, david, a, king, affirms, his, nisba, to, qutrubul, noting, that, he, was, called, al, khw, rizm, al, qutrubbulli, because, he, was, born, just, outside, of, baghdad, regarding, al, khw, rizm, s, religion, toomer, writes, another, epithet, given, to, him, by, al, abar, al, maj, s, would, seem, to, indicate, that, he, was, an, adherent, of, the, old, zoroastrian, religion, this, would, still, have, been, possible, at, that, time, for, a, man, of, iranian, origin, but, the, pious, preface, to, al, khw, rizm, s, algebra, shows, that, he, was, an, orthodox, muslim, so, al, abar, s, epithet, could, mean, no, more, than, that, his, forebears, and, perhaps, he, in, his, youth, had, been, zoroastrians, ibn, al, nad, m, s, al, fihrist, includes, a, short, biography, on, al, khw, rizm, together, with, a, list, of, his, books, al, khw, rizm, accomplished, most, of, his, work, between, 813, and, 833, after, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, baghdad, had, become, the, centre, of, scientific, studies, and, trade, around, 820, ce, he, was, appointed, as, the, astronomer, and, head, of, the, library, of, the, house, of, wisdom, 14, the, house, of, wisdom, was, established, by, the, abbasid, caliph, al, ma, m, n, al, khw, rizm, studied, sciences, and, mathematics, including, the, translation, of, greek, and, sanskrit, scientific, manuscripts, he, was, also, a, historian, who, is, cited, by, the, likes, of, al, tabari, and, ibn, abi, tahir, during, the, reign, of, al, wathiq, he, is, said, to, have, been, involved, in, the, first, of, two, embassies, to, the, khazars, douglas, morton, dunlop, suggests, that, mu, ammad, ibn, m, s, al, khw, rizm, might, have, been, the, same, person, as, mu, ammad, ibn, m, s, ibn, sh, kir, the, eldest, of, the, three, ban, m, s, brothers, al, khw, rizm, s, contributions, to, mathematics, geography, astronomy, and, cartography, established, the, basis, for, innovation, in, algebra, and, trigonometry, his, systematic, approach, to, solving, linear, and, quadratic, equations, led, to, algebra, a, word, derived, from, the, title, of, his, book, on, the, subject, al, jabr, on, the, calculation, with, hindu, numerals, written, about, 820, was, principally, responsible, for, spreading, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, throughout, the, middle, east, and, europe, it, was, translated, into, latin, as, algoritmi, de, numero, indorum, al, khw, rizm, rendered, in, latin, as, algoritmi, led, to, the, term, algorithm, some, of, his, work, was, based, on, persian, and, babylonian, astronomy, indian, numbers, and, greek, mathematics, al, khw, rizm, systematized, and, corrected, ptolemy, s, data, for, africa, and, the, middle, east, another, major, book, was, kitab, surat, al, ard, the, image, of, the, earth, translated, as, geography, presenting, the, coordinates, of, places, based, on, those, in, the, geography, of, ptolemy, but, with, improved, values, for, the, mediterranean, sea, asia, and, africa, he, wrote, on, mechanical, devices, like, the, astrolabe, and, sundial, he, assisted, a, project, to, determine, the, circumference, of, the, earth, and, in, making, a, world, map, for, al, ma, mun, the, caliph, overseeing, 70, geographers, when, in, the, 12th, century, his, works, spread, to, europe, through, latin, translations, it, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, advance, of, mathematics, in, europe, al, jabr, the, compendious, book, on, calculation, by, completion, and, balancing, arabic, al, kit, b, al, mukhta, ar, f, is, b, al, jabr, wal, muq, bala, is, a, mathematical, book, written, approximately, 820, ce, it, was, written, with, the, encouragement, of, caliph, al, ma, mun, as, a, popular, work, on, calculation, and, is, replete, with, examples, and, applications, to, a, range, of, problems, in, trade, surveying, and, legal, inheritance, the, term, algebra, is, derived, from, the, name, of, one, of, the, basic, operations, with, equations, al, jabr, meaning, restoration, referring, to, adding, a, number, to, both, sides, of, the, equation, to, consolidate, or, cancel, terms, described, in, this, book, the, book, was, translated, in, latin, as, liber, algebrae, et, almucabala, by, robert, of, chester, segovia, 1145, hence, algebra, and, by, gerard, of, cremona, a, unique, arabic, copy, is, kept, at, oxford, and, was, translated, in, 1831, by, f, rosen, a, latin, translation, is, kept, in, cambridge, it, provided, an, exhaustive, account, of, solving, polynomial, equations, up, to, the, second, degree, and, discussed, the, fundamental, method, of, reduction, and, balancing, referring, to, the, transposition, of, terms, to, the, other, side, of, an, equation, that, is, the, cancellation, of, like, terms, on, opposite, sides, of, the, equation, al, khw, rizm, s, method, of, solving, linear, and, quadratic, equations, worked, by, first, reducing, the, equation, to, one, of, six, standard, forms, where, b, and, c, are, positive, integers, by, dividing, out, the, coefficient, of, the, square, and, using, the, two, operations, al, jabr, arabic, restoring, or, completion, and, al, muq, bala, balancing, al, jabr, is, the, process, of, removing, negative, units, roots, and, squares, from, the, equation, by, adding, the, same, quantity, to, each, side, for, example, x, 2, 40, x, 4, x, 2, is, reduced, to, 5, x, 2, 40, x, al, muq, bala, is, the, process, of, bringing, quantities, of, the, same, type, to, the, same, side, of, the, equation, for, example, x, 2, 14, x, 5, is, reduced, to, x, 2, 9, x, the, above, discussion, uses, modern, mathematical, notation, for, the, types, of, problems, that, the, book, discusses, however, in, al, khw, rizm, s, day, most, of, this, notation, had, not, yet, been, invented, so, he, had, to, use, ordinary, text, to, present, problems, and, their, solutions, for, example, for, one, problem, he, writes, from, an, 1831, translation, if, some, one, says, you, divide, ten, into, two, parts, multiply, the, one, by, itself, it, will, be, equal, to, the, other, taken, eighty, one, times, computation, you, say, ten, less, a, thing, multiplied, by, itself, is, a, hundred, plus, a, square, less, twenty, things, and, this, is, equal, to, eighty, one, things, separate, the, twenty, things, from, a, hundred, and, a, square, and, add, them, to, eighty, one, it, will, then, be, a, hundred, plus, a, square, which, is, equal, to, a, hundred, and, one, roots, halve, the, roots, the, moiety, is, fifty, and, a, half, multiply, this, by, itself, it, is, two, thousand, five, hundred, and, fifty, and, a, quarter, subtract, from, this, one, hundred, the, remainder, is, two, thousand, four, hundred, and, fifty, and, a, quarter, extract, the, root, from, this, it, is, forty, nine, and, a, half, subtract, this, from, the, moiety, of, the, roots, which, is, fifty, and, a, half, there, remains, one, and, this, is, one, of, the, two, parts, in, modern, notation, this, process, with, x, the, thing, shay, or, root, is, given, by, the, steps, let, the, roots, of, the, equation, be, x, p, and, x, q, then, p, q, 2, 50, 1, 2, displaystyle, tfrac, p, q, 2, 50, tfrac, 1, 2, p, q, 100, displaystyle, pq, 100, and, so, a, root, is, given, by, several, authors, have, published, texts, under, the, name, of, kit, b, al, jabr, wal, muq, bala, including, ab, an, fa, d, nawar, ab, k, mil, ab, mu, ammad, al, adl, ab, y, suf, al, mi, abd, al, ham, d, ibn, turk, sind, ibn, al, sahl, ibn, bi, r, and, sharaf, al, d, n, al, s, solomon, gandz, has, described, al, khwarizmi, as, the, father, of, algebra, al, khwarizmi, s, algebra, is, regarded, as, the, foundation, and, cornerstone, of, the, sciences, in, a, sense, al, khwarizmi, is, more, entitled, to, be, called, the, father, of, algebra, than, diophantus, because, al, khwarizmi, is, the, first, to, teach, algebra, in, an, elementary, form, and, for, its, own, sake, diophantus, is, primarily, concerned, with, the, theory, of, numbers, victor, j, katz, adds, the, first, true, algebra, text, which, is, still, extant, is, the, work, on, al, jabr, and, al, muqabala, by, mohammad, ibn, musa, al, khwarizmi, written, in, baghdad, around, 825, john, j, o, connor, and, edmund, f, robertson, wrote, in, the, mactutor, history, of, mathematics, archive, perhaps, one, of, the, most, significant, advances, made, by, arabic, mathematics, began, at, this, time, with, the, work, of, al, khwarizmi, namely, the, beginnings, of, algebra, it, is, important, to, understand, just, how, significant, this, new, idea, was, it, was, a, revolutionary, move, away, from, the, greek, concept, of, mathematics, which, was, essentially, geometry, algebra, was, a, unifying, theory, which, allowed, rational, numbers, irrational, numbers, geometrical, magnitudes, etc, to, all, be, treated, as, algebraic, objects, it, gave, mathematics, a, whole, new, development, path, so, much, broader, in, concept, to, that, which, had, existed, before, and, provided, a, vehicle, for, future, development, of, the, subject, another, important, aspect, of, the, introduction, of, algebraic, ideas, was, that, it, allowed, mathematics, to, be, applied, to, itself, in, a, way, which, had, not, happened, before, roshdi, rashed, and, angela, armstrong, write, al, khwarizmi, s, text, can, be, seen, to, be, distinct, not, only, from, the, babylonian, tablets, but, also, from, diophantus, arithmetica, it, no, longer, concerns, a, series, of, problems, to, be, solved, but, an, exposition, which, starts, with, primitive, terms, in, which, the, combinations, must, give, all, possible, prototypes, for, equations, which, henceforward, explicitly, constitute, the, true, object, of, study, on, the, other, hand, the, idea, of, an, equation, for, its, own, sake, appears, from, the, beginning, and, one, could, say, in, a, generic, manner, insofar, as, it, does, not, simply, emerge, in, the, course, of, solving, a, problem, but, is, specifically, called, on, to, define, an, infinite, class, of, problems, according, to, swiss, american, historian, of, mathematics, florian, cajori, al, khwarizmi, s, algebra, was, different, from, the, work, of, indian, mathematicians, for, indians, had, no, rules, like, the, restoration, and, reduction, regarding, the, dissimilarity, and, significance, of, al, khwarizmi, s, algebraic, work, from, that, of, indian, mathematician, brahmagupta, carl, b, boyer, wrote, it, is, true, that, in, two, respects, the, work, of, al, khowarizmi, represented, a, retrogression, from, that, of, diophantus, first, it, is, on, a, far, more, elementary, level, than, that, found, in, the, diophantine, problems, and, second, the, algebra, of, al, khowarizmi, is, thoroughly, rhetorical, with, none, of, the, syncopation, found, in, the, greek, arithmetica, or, in, brahmagupta, s, work, even, numbers, were, written, out, in, words, rather, than, symbols, it, is, quite, unlikely, that, al, khwarizmi, knew, of, the, work, of, diophantus, but, he, must, have, been, familiar, with, at, least, the, astronomical, and, computational, portions, of, brahmagupta, yet, neither, al, khwarizmi, nor, other, arabic, scholars, made, use, of, syncopation, or, of, negative, numbers, nevertheless, the, al, jabr, comes, closer, to, the, elementary, algebra, of, today, than, the, works, of, either, diophantus, or, brahmagupta, because, the, book, is, not, concerned, with, difficult, problems, in, indeterminant, analysis, but, with, a, straight, forward, and, elementary, exposition, of, the, solution, of, equations, especially, that, of, second, degree, the, arabs, in, general, loved, a, good, clear, argument, from, premise, to, conclusion, as, well, as, systematic, organization, respects, in, which, neither, diophantus, nor, the, hindus, excelled, al, khw, rizm, s, second, most, influential, work, was, on, the, subject, of, arithmetic, which, survived, in, latin, translations, but, is, lost, in, the, original, arabic, his, writings, include, the, text, kit, b, al, is, b, al, hind, book, of, indian, computation, and, perhaps, a, more, elementary, text, kitab, al, jam, wa, l, tafriq, al, is, b, al, hind, addition, and, subtraction, in, indian, arithmetic, these, texts, described, algorithms, on, decimal, numbers, hindu, arabic, numerals, that, could, be, carried, out, on, a, dust, board, called, takht, in, arabic, latin, tabula, a, board, covered, with, a, thin, layer, of, dust, or, sand, was, employed, for, calculations, on, which, figures, could, be, written, with, a, stylus, and, easily, erased, and, replaced, when, necessary, al, khwarizmi, s, algorithms, were, used, for, almost, three, centuries, until, replaced, by, al, uqlidisi, s, algorithms, that, could, be, carried, out, with, pen, and, paper, as, part, of, 12th, century, wave, of, arabic, science, flowing, into, europe, via, translations, these, texts, proved, to, be, revolutionary, in, europe, al, khwarizmi, s, latinized, name, algorismus, turned, into, the, name, of, method, used, for, computations, and, survives, in, the, term, algorithm, it, gradually, replaced, the, previous, abacus, based, methods, used, in, europe, four, latin, texts, providing, adaptions, of, al, khwarizmi, s, methods, have, survived, even, though, none, of, them, is, believed, to, be, a, literal, translation, dixit, algorizmi, thus, spake, al, khwarizmi, is, the, starting, phrase, of, a, manuscript, in, the, university, of, cambridge, library, which, is, generally, referred, to, by, its, 1857, title, algoritmi, de, numero, indorum, it, is, attributed, to, the, adelard, of, bath, who, had, translated, the, astronomical, tables, in, 1126, it, is, perhaps, the, closest, to, al, khwarizmi, s, own, writings, al, khwarizmi, s, work, on, arithmetic, was, responsible, for, introducing, the, arabic, numerals, based, on, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, developed, in, indian, mathematics, to, the, western, world, the, term, algorithm, is, derived, from, the, algorism, the, technique, of, performing, arithmetic, with, hindu, arabic, numerals, developed, by, al, khw, rizm, both, algorithm, and, algorism, are, derived, from, the, latinized, forms, of, al, khw, rizm, s, name, algoritmi, and, algorismi, respectively, al, khw, rizm, s, z, j, as, sindhind, arabic, astronomical, tables, of, siddhanta, is, a, work, consisting, of, approximately, 37, chapters, on, calendrical, and, astronomical, calculations, and, 116, tables, with, calendrical, astronomical, and, astrological, data, as, well, as, a, table, of, sine, values, this, is, the, first, of, many, arabic, zijes, based, on, the, indian, astronomical, methods, known, as, the, sindhind, the, word, sindhind, is, a, corruption, of, the, sanskrit, siddh, nta, which, is, the, usual, designation, of, an, astronomical, textbook, in, fact, the, mean, motions, in, the, tables, of, al, khwarizmi, are, derived, from, those, in, the, corrected, brahmasiddhanta, brahmasphutasiddhanta, of, brahmagupta, the, work, contains, tables, for, the, movements, of, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, five, planets, known, at, the, time, this, work, marked, the, turning, point, in, islamic, astronomy, hitherto, muslim, astronomers, had, adopted, a, primarily, research, approach, to, the, field, translating, works, of, others, and, learning, already, discovered, knowledge, the, original, arabic, version, written, c, 820, is, lost, but, a, version, by, the, spanish, astronomer, maslama, al, majriti, c, 1000, has, survived, in, a, latin, translation, presumably, by, adelard, of, bath, 26, january, 1126, the, four, surviving, manuscripts, of, the, latin, translation, are, kept, at, the, biblioth, que, publique, chartres, the, biblioth, que, mazarine, paris, the, biblioteca, nacional, madrid, and, the, bodleian, library, oxford, al, khw, rizm, s, z, j, as, sindhind, contained, tables, for, the, trigonometric, functions, of, sines, and, cosine, a, related, treatise, on, spherical, trigonometry, is, attributed, to, him, al, khw, rizm, produced, accurate, sine, and, cosine, tables, and, the, first, table, of, tangents, al, khw, rizm, s, third, major, work, is, his, kit, b, rat, al, ar, arabic, book, of, the, description, of, the, earth, also, known, as, his, geography, which, was, finished, in, 833, it, is, a, major, reworking, of, ptolemy, s, second, century, geography, consisting, of, a, list, of, 2402, coordinates, of, cities, and, other, geographical, features, following, a, general, introduction, there, is, one, surviving, copy, of, kit, b, rat, al, ar, which, is, kept, at, the, strasbourg, university, library, a, latin, translation, is, at, the, biblioteca, nacional, de, espa, a, in, madrid, the, book, opens, with, the, list, of, latitudes, and, longitudes, in, order, of, weather, zones, that, is, to, say, in, blocks, of, latitudes, and, in, each, weather, zone, by, order, of, longitude, as, paul, gallez, notes, this, system, allows, the, deduction, of, many, latitudes, and, longitudes, where, the, only, extant, document, is, in, such, a, bad, condition, as, to, make, it, practically, illegible, neither, the, arabic, copy, nor, the, latin, translation, include, the, map, of, the, world, however, hubert, daunicht, was, able, to, reconstruct, the, missing, map, from, the, list, of, coordinates, daunicht, read, the, latitudes, and, longitudes, of, the, coastal, points, in, the, manuscript, or, deduced, them, from, the, context, where, they, were, not, legible, he, transferred, the, points, onto, graph, paper, and, connected, them, with, straight, lines, obtaining, an, approximation, of, the, coastline, as, it, was, on, the, original, map, he, did, the, same, for, the, rivers, and, towns, al, khw, rizm, corrected, ptolemy, s, gross, overestimate, for, the, length, of, the, mediterranean, sea, from, the, canary, islands, to, the, eastern, shores, of, the, mediterranean, ptolemy, overestimated, it, at, 63, degrees, of, longitude, while, al, khw, rizm, almost, correctly, estimated, it, at, nearly, 50, degrees, of, longitude, he, depicted, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, as, open, bodies, of, water, not, land, locked, seas, as, ptolemy, had, done, al, khw, rizm, s, prime, meridian, at, the, fortunate, isles, was, thus, around, 10, east, of, the, line, used, by, marinus, and, ptolemy, most, medieval, muslim, gazetteers, continued, to, use, al, khw, rizm, s, prime, meridian, al, khw, rizm, wrote, several, other, works, including, a, treatise, on, the, hebrew, calendar, titled, ris, la, fi, istikhr, j, ta, r, kh, al, yah, d, arabic, extraction, of, the, jewish, era, it, describes, the, metonic, cycle, a, 19, year, intercalation, cycle, the, rules, for, determining, on, what, day, of, the, week, the, first, day, of, the, month, tishrei, shall, fall, calculates, the, interval, between, the, anno, mundi, or, jewish, year, and, the, seleucid, era, and, gives, rules, for, determining, the, mean, longitude, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, using, the, hebrew, calendar, similar, material, is, found, in, the, works, of, al, b, r, n, and, maimonides, ibn, al, nadim, s, al, fihrist, an, index, of, arabic, books, mentions, al, khw, rizm, s, kit, b, al, ta, r, kh, arabic, a, book, of, annals, no, direct, manuscript, survives, however, a, copy, had, reached, nusaybin, by, the, 11th, century, where, its, metropolitan, bishop, mar, elias, bar, shinaya, found, it, elias, s, chronicle, quotes, it, from, the, death, of, the, prophet, through, to, 169, ah, at, which, point, elias, s, text, itself, hits, a, lacuna, several, arabic, manuscripts, in, berlin, istanbul, tashkent, cairo, and, paris, contain, further, material, that, surely, or, with, some, probability, comes, from, al, khw, rizm, the, istanbul, manuscript, contains, a, paper, on, sundials, the, fihrist, credits, al, khw, rizm, with, kit, b, ar, rukh, ma, t, arabic, other, papers, such, as, one, on, the, determination, of, the, direction, of, mecca, are, on, the, spherical, astronomy, two, texts, deserve, special, interest, on, the, morning, width, ma, rifat, sa, at, al, mashriq, f, kull, balad, and, the, determination, of, the, azimuth, from, a, height, ma, rifat, al, samt, min, qibal, al, irtif, he, wrote, two, books, on, using, and, constructing, astrolabes
