exclusively, for, female, royalty, and, politicians, despite, this, recognition, the, royal, family, rigidly, opposed, her, potential, marriage, to, the, king, s, uncle, a, rejection, that, deeply, wounded, her, pride, it, led, her, to, distance, herself, from, the, royal, family, and, embrace, grassroots, causes, exemplified, by, her, acceptance, of, the, request, of, the, egyptian, legion, trapped, in, the, faluja, pocket, during, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, who, had, asked, her, to, sing, a, particular, song, among, the, army, men, trapped, were, the, figures, who, would, lead, the,

her, because, she, had, sung, for, the, then, deposed, king, farouk, of, egypt, when, nasser, discovered, that, her, songs, were, banned, from, being, aired, on, the, radio, he, reportedly, said, something, to, the, effect, of, what, are, they, crazy, do, you, want, egypt, to, turn, against, us, later, nasser, would, schedule, his, speeches, so, they, would, not, interfere, with, the, radio, performances, of, umm, kulthum, some, claim, that, umm, kulthum, s, popularity, helped, nasser, s, political, agenda, for, example, nasser, s, speeches, and, other, government, messages, were, frequently, broadcast, immediately, after, umm, kulthum, s, monthly, radio, concerts, she, sang, many, songs, in, support, of, nasser, with, whom, she, developed, a, close, friendship, one, of, her, songs, associated, with, nasser, wall, hi, zam, n, y, sil, it, s, been, a, long, time, o, weapon, of, mine, was, adopted, as, the, egyptian, national, anthem, from, 1960, to, 1979, when, president, sadat, replaced, it, by, the, less, militant, bilady, bilady, bilady, following, peace, negotiations, with, israel, it, remains, the, egyptian, anthem, to, this, day, umm, kulthum, was, also, known, for, her, continuous, contributions, to, works, supporting, the, egyptian, military, efforts, until, 1972, for, about, half, a, century, she, gave, at, least, one, monthly, concert, umm, kulthum, s, monthly, concerts, were, renowned, for, their, ability, to, clear, the, streets, of, some, of, the, world, s, most, populous, cities, as, people, rushed, home, to, tune, in, her, songs, deal, mostly, with, the, universal, themes, of, love, longing, and, loss, a, typical, umm, kulthum, concert, consisted, of, the, performance, of, two, or, three, songs, over, a, period, of, three, to, four, hours, these, performances, are, in, some, ways, reminiscent, of, the, structure, of, western, opera, consisting, of, long, vocal, passages, linked, by, shorter, orchestral, interludes, however, umm, kulthum, was, not, stylistically, influenced, by, opera, and, she, sang, solo, for, most, of, her, career, during, the, 1930s, her, repertoire, took, the, first, of, several, specific, stylistic, directions, her, songs, were, virtuosic, as, befitted, her, newly, trained, and, very, capable, voice, and, romantic, and, modern, in, musical, style, feeding, the, prevailing, currents, in, egyptian, popular, culture, of, the, time, she, worked, extensively, with, texts, by, romance, poet, ahmad, rami, and, composer, mohammad, el, qasabgi, whose, songs, incorporated, european, instruments, such, as, the, violoncello, and, double, bass, as, well, as, harmony, in, 1936, she, made, her, debut, as, an, actress, in, the, movie, weddad, by, fritz, kramp, during, her, career, she, would, act, in, five, more, movies, of, which, four, would, be, directed, by, ahmad, badrakhan, while, sallama, and, fatma, would, be, the, most, acclaimed, umm, kulthum, s, musical, directions, in, the, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, and, her, mature, performing, style, led, this, period, to, become, popularly, known, as, the, singer, s, golden, age, keeping, up, with, changing, popular, taste, as, well, as, her, own, artistic, inclinations, in, the, early, 1940s, she, requested, songs, from, composer, zakariya, ahmad, and, colloquial, poet, mahmud, bayram, el, tunsi, cast, in, styles, considered, to, be, indigenously, egyptian, this, represented, a, dramatic, departure, from, the, modernist, romantic, songs, of, the, 1930s, mainly, led, by, mohammad, el, qasabgi, umm, kulthum, had, abstained, from, singing, qasabgi, s, music, since, the, early, 1940s, their, last, stage, song, collaboration, in, 1941, was, raq, el, habib, the, lover, s, heart, softens, one, of, her, most, popular, intricate, and, high, calibre, songs, the, reason, for, the, separation, is, not, clear, it, is, speculated, that, this, was, due, in, part, to, the, popular, failure, of, the, movie, aida, in, which, umm, kulthum, sings, mostly, qasabgi, s, compositions, qasabgi, was, experimenting, with, arabic, music, influenced, by, classical, european, music, and, had, been, composing, a, lot, for, asmahan, a, singer, who, immigrated, to, egypt, from, syria, she, was, umm, kulthum, s, only, serious, competitor, before, her, death, in, a, car, accident, in, 1944, simultaneously, umm, kulthum, started, to, rely, heavily, on, a, younger, composer, who, joined, her, artistic, team, a, few, years, earlier, riad, al, sunbati, while, sonbati, was, evidently, influenced, by, qasabgi, in, those, early, years, the, melodic, lines, he, composed, were, more, lyrical, and, more, acceptable, to, umm, kulthum, s, audience, the, result, of, collaborations, with, rami, sonbati, and, al, tunisi, ahmad, was, a, populist, and, popular, repertoire, that, had, lasting, appeal, for, the, egyptian, audience, in, 1946, umm, kulthum, defied, all, odds, by, presenting, a, religious, poem, in, classical, arabic, salou, qalbi, written, by, ahmad, shawqi, and, composed, by, ryad, al, sunbati, the, success, was, immediate, and, it, reconnected, umm, kulthum, with, her, early, singing, years, similar, poems, written, by, shawqi, were, subsequently, composed, by, sonbati, and, sung, by, umm, kulthum, including, woulida, el, houda, 1949, in, which, she, surprised, royalists, by, singing, a, verse, that, describes, muhammad, as, the, imam, of, socialists, at, the, peak, of, her, career, in, 1950, umm, kulthum, sang, sonbati, s, composition, of, excerpts, of, what, ahmad, rami, considered, the, accomplishment, of, his, career, the, translation, from, persian, into, classical, arabic, of, omar, khayy, m, s, quatrains, rubayyiat, el, khayyam, the, song, included, quatrains, that, deal, with, both, epicurianism, and, redemption, ibrahim, nagi, s, poem, al, atlal, sung, by, umm, kalthum, in, 1966, in, a, personal, version, and, with, a, melody, composed, by, sonbati, is, considered, one, of, her, signature, songs, as, umm, kulthum, s, vocal, abilities, had, regressed, considerably, by, then, the, song, can, be, viewed, as, the, last, example, of, genuine, arabic, music, at, a, time, when, even, umm, kulthum, had, started, to, compromise, by, singing, western, influenced, pieces, composed, by, her, old, rival, mohammed, abdel, wahab, when, umm, kulthum, sang, live, the, duration, of, each, song, was, not, fixed, as, she, would, repeat, at, length, verses, requested, by, the, audience, her, performances, usually, lasted, for, up, to, five, hours, during, which, three, songs, were, sung, for, example, the, available, live, performances, about, thirty, in, number, of, ya, zalemni, one, of, her, most, popular, songs, varied, in, length, from, 45, to, 90, minutes, besides, requests, it, also, depended, on, her, creative, mood, for, improvisations, illustrating, the, dynamic, relationship, between, the, singer, and, the, audience, as, they, fed, off, each, other, s, emotional, energy, one, of, her, improvisatory, techniques, was, to, repeat, a, single, line, or, stance, over, and, over, subtly, altering, the, emotive, emphasis, and, intensity, and, exploring, one, or, various, musical, modal, scales, maq, m, each, time, to, bring, her, audiences, into, a, euphoric, and, ecstatic, state, known, in, arabic, as, tarab, this, was, typical, of, old, classical, arabic, singing, and, she, executed, the, technique, for, as, long, as, she, could, have, both, her, regressing, vocal, abilities, with, age, and, the, increased, westernization, of, arabic, music, became, an, impediment, to, this, art, her, concerts, used, to, broadcast, from, 9, 30, pm, on, thursday, until, the, early, morning, hours, on, friday, the, spontaneous, creativity, of, umm, kulthum, as, a, singer, is, most, impressive, when, upon, listening, to, these, many, different, renditions, of, the, same, song, over, a, period, of, five, years, 1954, 1959, the, listener, is, offered, a, completely, unique, and, different, experience, this, intense, highly, personalized, relationship, was, undoubtedly, one, of, the, reasons, for, umm, kulthum, s, tremendous, success, as, an, artist, it, is, worth, noting, though, that, the, length, of, a, performance, did, not, necessarily, reflect, either, its, quality, or, the, improvisatory, creativity, of, umm, kulthum, around, 1965, umm, kulthum, started, collaborating, with, composer, mohammed, abdel, wahab, her, first, song, composed, by, abdel, wahab, was, enta, omri, and, later, became, one, of, her, iconic, songs, in, 1969, it, was, followed, by, another, asbaha, al, ana, indi, bunduqiyyah, her, songs, took, on, more, a, soul, searching, quality, in, 1967, following, the, defeat, of, egypt, during, the, six, day, war, hadeeth, el, rouh, which, is, a, translation, of, the, poet, mohammad, iqbal, s, shikwa, set, a, very, reflective, tone, generals, in, the, audience, are, said, to, have, been, left, in, tears, following, the, formation, of, the, united, arab, emirates, uae, in, 1971, she, staged, several, concerts, upon, the, invitation, of, its, first, president, zayed, bin, sultan, al, nahyan, to,
