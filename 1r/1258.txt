the, autonomy, of, the, commonwealth, s, subjects, he, was, using, foreign, powers, leading, to, destabilization, of, the, country, augustus, ruled, poland, with, an, interval, in, 1704, the, swedes, installed, nobleman, stanis, aw, leszczy, ski, as, king, who, officially, reigned, from, 1706, to, 1709, and, after, augustus, death, in, 1733, which, sparked, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, augustus, body, was, buried, in, poland, s, royal, wawel, cathedral, in, krak, w, but, his, heart, rests, in, the, dresden, cathedral, his, only, legitimate, son, augustus, iii, of, poland, became, king, in, 1733, augustus, was, born, in, dresden, on, 12, may, 1670, the, younger, son, of, john, george, iii, elector, of, saxony, and, princess, anna, sophie, of, denmark, as, the, second, son, augustus, had, no, expectation, of, inheriting, the, electorate, since, his, older, brother, john, george, iv, assumed, the, post, after, the, death, of, their, father, on, 12, september, 1691,

augustus, had, to, convert, to, roman, catholicism, the, saxon, electors, had, traditionally, been, called, champions, of, the, reformation, christian, august, of, saxe, zeitz, baptized, him, and, announced, his, conversion, saxony, had, been, a, stronghold, of, german, protestantism, and, augustus, conversion, was, therefore, considered, shocking, in, protestant, europe, although, the, prince, elector, guaranteed, saxony, s, religious, status, quo, augustus, conversion, alienated, many, of, his, protestant, subjects, as, a, result, of, the, enormous, expenditure, of, money, used, to, bribe, the, polish, nobility, and, clergy, augustus, contemporaries, derisively, referred, to, the, saxon, elector, s, royal, ambitions, as, his, polish, adventure, his, church, policy, within, the, holy, roman, empire, followed, orthodox, lutheranism, and, ran, counter, to, his, new, found, religious, and, absolutist, convictions, the, protestant, princes, of, the, empire, and, the, two, remaining, protestant, electors, of, hanover, and, prussia, were, anxious, to, keep, saxony, well, integrated, in, their, camp, according, to, the, peace, of, augsburg, augustus, theoretically, had, the, right, to, re, introduce, roman, catholicism, see, cuius, regio, eius, religio, or, at, least, grant, full, religious, freedom, to, his, fellow, catholics, in, saxony, but, this, never, happened, saxony, remained, lutheran, and, the, few, roman, catholics, residing, in, saxony, lacked, any, political, or, civil, rights, in, 1717, it, became, clear, just, how, awkward, the, situation, was, to, realize, his, ambitious, dynastic, plans, in, poland, and, germany, it, was, necessary, for, augustus, heirs, to, become, roman, catholic, after, five, years, as, a, convert, his, son, the, future, augustus, iii, publicly, avowed, his, roman, catholicism, the, saxon, estates, were, outraged, and, revolted, as, it, became, clear, that, his, conversion, to, catholicism, was, not, only, a, matter, of, form, but, of, substance, as, well, since, the, peace, of, westphalia, the, elector, of, saxony, had, been, the, director, of, the, protestant, body, in, the, reichstag, to, placate, the, other, protestant, states, in, the, empire, augustus, nominally, delegated, the, directorship, of, the, protestant, body, to, johann, adolf, ii, duke, of, saxe, weissenfels, however, when, the, elector, s, son, also, converted, to, catholicism, the, electorate, faced, a, hereditary, catholic, succession, instead, of, a, return, to, a, protestant, elector, upon, augustus, s, death, when, the, conversion, became, public, in, 1717, brandenburg, prussia, and, hanover, attempted, to, oust, saxony, from, the, directorship, and, appoint, themselves, as, joint, directors, but, they, gave, up, the, attempt, in, 1720, saxony, would, retain, the, directorship, of, the, protestant, body, in, the, reichstag, until, the, dissolution, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1806, despite, the, fact, that, all, remaining, electors, of, saxony, were, catholic, the, wife, of, augustus, the, electress, christiane, eberhardine, refused, to, follow, her, husband, s, example, and, remained, a, staunch, protestant, she, did, not, attend, her, husband, s, coronation, in, poland, and, led, a, rather, quiet, life, outside, dresden, gaining, some, popularity, for, her, stubbornness, following, the, death, of, polish, king, john, iii, sobieski, and, having, converted, to, catholicism, augustus, won, election, as, king, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, 1697, with, the, backing, of, russia, and, austria, which, financed, him, through, the, banker, issachar, berend, lehmann, at, the, time, some, questioned, the, legality, of, augustus, elevation, since, another, candidate, fran, ois, louis, prince, of, conti, had, received, more, votes, each, candidate, conti, and, augustus, was, proclaimed, as, king, by, a, different, ecclesiastical, authority, the, primate, micha, stefan, radziejowski, proclaimed, conti, and, the, bishop, of, kujawy, stanis, aw, d, mbski, proclaimed, augustus, with, jacob, heinrich, von, flemming, swearing, to, the, pacta, conventa, as, augustus, s, proxy, however, augustus, hurried, to, the, commonwealth, with, a, saxon, army, while, conti, stayed, in, france, for, two, months, although, he, had, led, the, imperial, troops, against, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1695, and, 1696, without, very, much, success, augustus, continued, the, war, of, the, holy, league, against, turkey, and, during, a, campaign, against, the, ottomans, his, polish, army, defeated, a, tatar, expedition, in, the, battle, of, podhajce, in, 1698, unfortunately, on, 22, september, a, conflict, between, polish, and, saxon, troops, was, narrowly, avoided, causing, the, campaign, to, end, victory, at, podhajce, had, the, political, impact, of, forcing, the, ottoman, empire, to, return, podolia, and, kamieniec, podolski, in, treaty, of, karlowitz, in, 1699, an, ambitious, ruler, augustus, hoped, to, make, the, polish, throne, hereditary, within, his, family, and, to, use, his, resources, as, elector, of, saxony, to, impose, some, order, on, the, chaotic, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, he, was, however, soon, distracted, from, his, internal, reform, projects, by, the, possibility, of, external, conquest, he, formed, an, alliance, with, frederick, iv, of, denmark, and, peter, i, of, russia, to, strip, the, young, king, charles, xii, of, sweden, augustus, cousin, of, his, possessions, poland, s, reward, for, participation, in, the, great, northern, war, was, to, have, been, swedish, livonia, charles, proved, an, able, military, commander, however, quickly, forcing, the, danes, out, of, the, war, and, then, driving, back, the, russians, at, narva, in, 1700, thereby, allowing, him, to, focus, on, the, struggle, with, augustus, however, this, war, ultimately, proved, as, disastrous, for, sweden, as, for, poland, charles, defeated, augustus, army, at, riga, in, july, 1701, forcing, the, polish, saxon, army, to, withdraw, from, livonia, and, followed, this, up, with, an, invasion, of, poland, he, captured, warsaw, on, 14, may, 1702, defeated, the, polish, saxon, army, again, at, the, battle, of, klisz, w, july, 1702, and, took, krak, w, he, defeated, another, of, augustus, armies, under, the, command, of, generalfeldmarschall, adam, heinrich, von, steinau, at, the, battle, of, pu, tusk, in, spring, 1703, and, besieged, and, captured, toru, by, this, time, augustus, was, certainly, ready, for, peace, but, charles, felt, that, he, would, be, more, secure, if, he, could, establish, someone, with, whom, he, had, more, influence, on, the, polish, throne, in, 1704, the, swedes, installed, stanis, aw, leszczy, ski, and, tied, the, commonwealth, to, sweden, which, compelled, augustus, to, initiate, military, operations, in, poland, alongside, russia, an, alliance, was, concluded, in, narva, in, summer, 1704, the, resulting, civil, war, in, poland, 1704, 1706, and, the, grodno, campaign, 1705, 1706, did, not, go, well, for, augustus, following, the, battle, of, fraustadt, on, 1, september, 1706, charles, invaded, saxony, forcing, augustus, to, yield, the, polish, throne, to, leszczy, ski, by, the, treaty, of, altranst, dt, october, 1706, meanwhile, russia, s, tsar, peter, had, reformed, his, army, and, he, dealt, a, crippling, defeat, to, the, swedes, at, the, battle, of, poltava, 1709, this, spelled, the, end, of, the, swedish, empire, and, the, rise, of, the, russian, empire, the, weakened, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, soon, came, to, be, regarded, as, almost, a, protectorate, of, russia, in, 1709, augustus, ii, returned, to, the, polish, throne, under, russian, auspices, once, again, he, attempted, to, establish, an, absolute, monarchy, in, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, but, was, faced, with, opposition, from, the, nobility, szlachta, see, tarnogr, d, confederation, he, was, handicapped, by, the, mutual, jealousy, of, the, saxons, and, the, poles, and, a, struggle, broke, out, in, poland, which, was, only, ended, when, the, king, promised, to, limit, the, number, of, his, army, in, that, country, to, 18, 000, men, peter, the, great, seized, on, the, opportunity, to, pose, as, mediator, threatened, the, commonwealth, militarily, and, in, 1717, forced, augustus, and, the, nobility, to, sign, an, accommodation, favorable, to, russian, interests, at, the, silent, sejm, sejm, niemy, for, the, remainder, of, his, reign, in, an, uneasy, relationship, augustus, was, more, or, less, dependent, on, russia, and, to, a, lesser, extent, on, austria, to, maintain, his, polish, throne, he, gave, up, his, dynastic, ambitions, and, concentrated, instead, on, attempts, to, strengthen, the, commonwealth, faced, with, both, internal, and, foreign, opposition, however, he, achieved, little, in, 1729, he, established, the, grand, musketeers, company, in, dresden, one, of, the, oldest, polish, officers, schools, which, in, 1730, was, relocated, to, warsaw, augustus, died, at, warsaw, in, 1733, although, he, had, failed, to, make, the, polish, throne, hereditary, in, his, house, his, eldest, son, frederick, augustus, ii, of, saxony, succeeded, him, to, the, polish, throne, as, augustus, iii, of, poland, although, he, had, to, be, installed, by, the, imperial, russian, army, during, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, augustus, is, perhaps, best, remembered, as, a, patron, of, the, arts, and, architecture, he, had, beautiful, palaces, built, in, dresden, a, city, that, became, renowned, for, extraordinary, cultural, brilliance, he, introduced, the, first, public, museums, such, as, the, green, vault, in, 1723, and, started, systematic, collection, of, paintings, that, are, now, on, display, in, the, gem, ldegalerie, alte, meister, from, 1687, to, 1689, augustus, toured, france, and, italy, the, extravagant, court, in, versailles, perfectly, tailored, to, fit, the, needs, of, an, absolute, monarch, impressed, him, deeply, in, accordance, with, the, spirit, of, the, baroque, age, augustus, invested, heavily, in, the, representative, splendor, of, dresden, castle, his, major, residence, to, advertise, his, wealth, and, power, with, strict, building, regulations, major, urban, development, plans, and, a, certain, feeling, for, art, the, king, began, to, transform, dresden, into, a, renowned, cultural, center, with, one, of, germany, s, finest, art, collections, though, most, of, the, city, s, famous, sights, and, landmarks, were, completed, during, the, reign, of, his, son, augustus, iii, the, most, famous, building, started, under, augustus, the, strong, was, the, zwinger, also, known, are, pillnitz, castle, his,

the, other, end, from, 1, to, 26, june, 1730, he, held, the, zeithain, encampment, after, reorganizing, and, reequipping, his, army, the, prussian, king, frederick, william, i, was, present, as, well,

to, potter, was, orchestrated, as, an, attempt, to, avoid, the, impossible, demands, of, the, king, being, an, alchemist, by, profession, rather, than, a, potter, gave, b, ttger, an, advantage, he, realised, that, the, current, approaches, which, involved, mixing, fine, white, substances, like, crushed, egg, shells, into, clay, would, not, work, rather, his, approach, was, to, attempt, to, bake, clay, at, higher, temperatures, than, had, ever, before, been, attained, in, european, kilns, that, approach, yielded, the, breakthrough, that, had, eluded, european, potters, for, a, century, by,

wilhelmine, of, bayreuth, claimed, that, augustus, had, as, many, as, 365, or, 382, children, the, number, is, extremely, difficult, to, verify, perhaps, the, number, refers, not, to, the, king, s, children, but, to, the, nights, that, he, spent, with, his, mistresses, augustus, officially, recognised, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, that, number, as, his, bastards, the, mothers, of, these, chosen, ones, with, the, possible, exception, of, fatima, and, henriette, r, nard, were, all, aristocratic, ladies
