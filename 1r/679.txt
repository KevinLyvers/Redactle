the, rothschild, family, r, s, t, a, l, d, roth, s, chylde, german, is, a, wealthy, ashkenazi, jewish, noble, banking, family, originally, from, frankfurt, the, family, s, documented, history, starts, in, 16th, century, frankfurt, its, name, is, derived, from, the, family, house, rothschild, built, by, isaak, elchanan, bacharach, in, frankfurt, in, 1567, the, family, rose, to, prominence, with, mayer, amschel, rothschild, 1744, 1812, a, court, factor, to, the, german, landgraves, of, hesse, kassel, in, the, free, city, of, frankfurt, holy, roman, empire, who, established, his, banking, business, in, the, 1760s, unlike, most, previous, court, factors, rothschild, managed, to, bequeath, his, wealth, and, established, an, international, banking, family, through, his, five, sons, who, established, businesses, in, paris, frankfurt, london, vienna, and, naples, the, family, was, elevated, to, noble, rank, in, the, holy, roman, empire, and, the, united, kingdom, during, the, 19th, century, the, rothschild, family, possessed, the, largest, private, fortune, in, the, world, as, well, as, in, modern, world, history, the, family, s, wealth, declined, over, the, 20th, century, and, was, divided, among, many, descendants, today, their, interests, cover, a, diverse, range, of, fields, including, financial, services, real, estate, mining, energy, agriculture, winemaking, and, nonprofits, many, examples, of, the, family, s, rural, architecture, exist, across, northwestern, europe, the, rothschild, family, has, frequently, been, the, subject, of, conspiracy, theories, many, of, which, have, antisemitic, origins, the, first, member, of, the, family, who, was, known, to, use, the, name, rothschild, was, isaak, elchanan, rothschild, born, in, 1577, the, name, is, derived, from, the, german, zum, rothen, schild, with, the, old, spelling, th, meaning, at, the, red, shield, in, reference, to, the, house, where, the, family, lived, for, many, generations, in, those, days, houses, were, designated, not, by, numbers, but, by, signs, displaying, different, symbols, or, colours, a, red, shield, can, still, be, seen, at, the, centre, of, the, rothschild, coat, of, arms, the, family, s, ascent, to, international, prominence, began, in, 1744, with, the, birth, of, mayer, amschel, rothschild, in, frankfurt, am, main, germany, he, was, the, son, of, amschel, moses, rothschild, born, circa, 1710, a, money, changer, who, had, traded, with, the, prince, of, hesse, born, in, the, judengasse, the, ghetto, of, frankfurt, mayer, developed, a, finance, house, and, spread, his, empire, by, installing, each, of, his, five, sons, in, the, five, main, european, financial, centres, to, conduct, business, the, rothschild, coat, of, arms, contains, a, clenched, fist, with, five, arrows, symbolising, the, five, dynasties, established, by, the, five, sons, of, mayer, rothschild, in, a, reference, to, psalm, 127, like, arrows, in, the, hands, of, a, warrior, so, are, the, children, of, one, s, youth, the, family, motto, appears, below, the, shield, concordia, integritas, industria, unity, integrity, industry, paul, johnson, writes, he, rothschilds, are, elusive, there, is, no, book, about, them, that, is, both, revealing, and, accurate, libraries, of, nonsense, have, been, written, about, them, a, woman, who, planned, to, write, a, book, entitled, lies, about, the, rothschilds, abandoned, it, saying, it, was, relatively, easy, to, spot, the, lies, but, it, proved, impossible, to, find, out, the, truth, johnson, writes, that, unlike, the, court, factors, of, earlier, centuries, who, had, financed, and, managed, european, noble, houses, but, often, lost, their, wealth, through, violence, or, expropriation, the, new, kind, of, international, bank, created, by, the, rothschilds, was, impervious, to, local, attacks, their, assets, were, held, in, financial, instruments, circulating, through, the, world, as, stocks, bonds, and, debts, changes, made, by, the, rothschilds, allowed, them, to, insulate, their, property, from, local, violence, henceforth, their, real, wealth, was, beyond, the, reach, of, the, mob, almost, beyond, the, reach, of, greedy, monarchs, johnson, argued, that, their, fortune, was, generated, to, the, greatest, extent, by, nathan, mayer, rothschild, in, london, however, more, recent, research, by, niall, ferguson, indicates, that, greater, and, equal, profits, also, were, realised, by, the, other, rothschild, dynasties, including, james, mayer, de, rothschild, in, paris, carl, mayer, von, rothschild, in, naples, and, amschel, mayer, rothschild, in, frankfurt, another, essential, part, of, mayer, rothschild, s, strategy, for, success, was, to, keep, control, of, their, banks, in, family, hands, allowing, them, to, maintain, full, secrecy, about, the, size, of, their, fortunes, in, about, 1906, the, jewish, encyclopedia, noted, the, practice, initiated, by, the, rothschilds, of, having, several, brothers, of, a, firm, establish, branches, in, the, different, financial, centres, was, followed, by, other, jewish, financiers, like, the, bischoffsheims, pereires, seligmans, lazards, and, others, and, these, financiers, by, their, integrity, and, financial, skill, obtained, credit, not, alone, with, their, jewish, confr, res, but, with, the, banking, fraternity, in, general, by, this, means, jewish, financiers, obtained, an, increasing, share, of, international, finance, during, the, middle, and, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, the, head, of, the, whole, group, was, the, rothschild, family, it, also, says, of, more, recent, years, non, jewish, financiers, have, learned, the, same, cosmopolitan, method, and, on, the, whole, the, control, is, now, rather, less, than, more, in, jewish, hands, than, formerly, mayer, rothschild, successfully, kept, the, fortune, in, the, family, with, carefully, arranged, marriages, often, between, first, or, second, cousins, similar, to, royal, intermarriage, by, the, late, 19th, century, however, almost, all, rothschilds, had, started, to, marry, outside, the, family, usually, into, the, aristocracy, or, other, financial, dynasties, his, sons, were, the, german, family, name, rothschild, is, pronounced, in, german, unlike, r, s, t, a, l, d, in, english, the, surname, rothschild, is, rare, in, germany, families, by, country, the, five, sons, of, mayer, amschel, rothschild, were, elevated, to, the, austrian, nobility, by, emperor, francis, i, of, austria, and, they, were, all, granted, the, austrian, hereditary, title, of, freiherr, baron, on, 29, september, 1822, the, british, branch, of, the, family, was, elevated, by, queen, victoria, who, granted, the, hereditary, title, of, baronet, 1847, and, later, the, hereditary, peerage, title, of, baron, rothschild, 1885, the, rothschilds, already, possessed, a, significant, fortune, before, the, start, of, the, napoleonic, wars, 1803, 1815, and, the, family, had, gained, preeminence, in, the, bullion, trade, by, this, time, from, london, in, 1813, to, 1815, nathan, mayer, rothschild, was, instrumental, in, almost, single, handedly, financing, the, british, war, effort, organising, the, shipment, of, bullion, to, the, duke, of, wellington, s, armies, across, europe, as, well, as, arranging, the, payment, of, british, financial, subsidies, to, their, continental, allies, in, 1815, alone, the, rothschilds, provided, 9, 8, million, equivalent, to, about, 850, million, in, 2023, in, subsidy, loans, to, britain, s, continental, allies, the, brothers, helped, coordinate, rothschild, activities, across, the, continent, and, the, family, developed, a, network, of, agents, shippers, and, couriers, to, transport, gold, across, war, torn, europe, the, family, network, was, also, to, provide, nathan, rothschild, time, and, again, with, political, and, financial, information, ahead, of, his, peers, giving, him, an, advantage, in, the, markets, and, rendering, the, house, of, rothschild, still, more, invaluable, to, the, british, government, in, one, instance, the, family, network, enabled, nathan, to, receive, in, london, the, news, of, wellington, s, victory, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, a, full, day, ahead, of, the, government, s, official, messengers, rothschild, s, first, concern, on, this, occasion, was, not, to, the, potential, financial, advantage, on, the, market, which, the, knowledge, would, have, given, him, he, and, his, courier, immediately, took, the, news, to, the, government, that, he, used, the, news, for, financial, advantage, was, a, fiction, then, repeated, in, later, popular, accounts, such, as, that, of, morton, the, basis, for, the, rothschilds, most, famously, profitable, move, was, made, after, the, news, of, british, victory, had, been, made, public, nathan, rothschild, calculated, that, the, future, reduction, in, government, borrowing, brought, about, by, the, peace, would, create, a, bounce, in, british, government, bonds, after, a, two, year, stabilisation, which, would, finalise, the, post, war, restructuring, of, the, domestic, economy, in, what, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, most, audacious, moves, in, financial, history, nathan, immediately, bought, up, the, government, bond, market, for, what, at, the, time, seemed, an, excessively, high, price, before, waiting, two, years, then, selling, the, bonds, on, the, crest, of, a, short, bounce, in, the, market, in, 1817, for, a, 40, profit, given, the, sheer, power, of, leverage, the, rothschild, family, had, at, their, disposal, this, profit, was, an, enormous, sum, nathan, mayer, rothschild, started, his, business, in, manchester, in, 1806, and, gradually, moved, it, to, london, where, in, 1809, he, acquired, the, location, at, 2, new, court, in, st, swithin, s, lane, city, of, london, where, it, operates, today, he, established, n, m, rothschild, sons, in, 1811, in, 1818, he, arranged, a, 5, million, equal, to, 440, million, in, 2023, loan, to, the, prussian, government, and, the, issuing, of, bonds, for, government, loans, formed, a, mainstay, of, his, bank, s, business, he, gained, a, position, of, such, power, in, the, city, of, london, that, by, 1825, 26, he, was, able, to, supply, enough, coin, to, the, bank, of, england, to, enable, it, to, avert, a, market, liquidity, crisis, rothschild, family, banking, businesses, pioneered, international, high, finance, during, the, industrialisation, of, europe, and, were, instrumental, in, supporting, railway, systems, across, the, world, and, in, complex, government, financing, for, projects, such, as, the, suez, canal, from, 1895, through, 1907, they, loaned, nearly, 450, 000, 000, equivalent, to, 14, 700, 000, 000, in, 2023, to, european, governments, during, the, 19th, century, the, family, bought, up, a, large, proportion, of, the, property, in, mayfair, london, the, rothschild, family, was, directly, involved, in, the, independence, of, brazil, from, portugal, in, the, early, 19th, century, upon, an, agreement, the, brazilian, government, should, pay, a, compensation, of, two, million, pounds, sterling, to, the, kingdom, of, portugal, to, accept, brazil, s, independence, n, m, rothschild, sons, was, pre, eminent, in, raising, this, capital, for, the, government, of, the, newly, formed, empire, of, brazil, on, the, london, market, in, 1825, nathan, rothschild, raised, 2, 000, 000, and, indeed, was, probably, discreetly, involved, in, the, earlier, tranche, of, this, loan, which, raised, 1, 000, 000, in, 1824, part, of, the, price, of, portuguese, recognition, of, brazilian, independence, secured, in, 1825, was, that, brazil, should, take, over, repayment, of, the, principal, and, interest, on, a, 1, 500, 000, loan, made, to, the, portuguese, government, in, 1823, by, n, m, rothschild, sons, a, correspondence, from, samuel, phillips, co, in, 1824, suggests, the, close, involvement, of, the, rothschilds, in, the, occasion, major, 19th, century, businesses, founded, with, rothschild, family, capital, include, the, family, funded, cecil, rhodes, in, the, creation, of, the, african, colony, of, rhodesia, from, the, late, 1880s, onwards, the, family, took, over, control, of, the, rio, tinto, mining, company, the, japanese, government, approached, the, london, and, paris, families, for, funding, during, the, russo, japanese, war, the, london, consortium, s, issue, of, japanese, war, bonds, would, total, 11, 5, million, at, 1907, currency, rates, 1, 11, billion, in, 2012, currency, terms, the, name, of, rothschild, became, synonymous, with, extravagance, and, great, wealth, and, the, family, was, renowned, for, its, art, collecting, for, its, palaces, as, well, as, for, its, philanthropy, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, family, owned, or, had, built, at, the, lowest, estimates, 41, palaces, of, a, scale, and, luxury, perhaps, unparalleled, even, by, the, richest, royal, families, the, british, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, david, lloyd, george, claimed, in, 1909, that, nathan, lord, rothschild, was, the, most, powerful, man, in, britain, niles, weekly, register, volume, 49, had, the, following, to, say, about, the, rothschilds, influence, on, international, high, finance, in, 1836, the, rothschilds, are, the, wonders, of, modern, banking, we, see, the, descendants, of, judah, after, a, persecution, of, two, thousand, years, peering, above, kings, rising, higher, than, emperors, and, holding, a, whole, continent, in, the, hollow, of, their, hands, the, rothschilds, govern, a, christian, world, not, a, cabinet, moves, without, their, advice, they, stretch, their, hand, with, equal, ease, from,

the, kings, of, europe, and, of, the, republican, chiefs, of, america, what, more, can, they, desire, the, neapolitan, rothschilds, was, the, first, branch, of, the, family, to, decline, when, revolution, broke, out, and, giuseppe, garibaldi, captured, naples, on, 7, september, 1860, and, set, up, a, provisional, italian, government, because, of, the, family, s, close, political, connections, with, austria, and, france, adolphe, carl, von, rothschild, was, caught, in, a, delicate, position, he, chose, to, take, temporary, sanctuary, in, gaeta, with, the, last, neapolitan, king, francis, ii, of, the, two, sicilies, however, the, rothschild, branches, in, london, paris, and, vienna, were, not, prepared, nor, willing, to, financially, support, the, deposed, king, with, the, ensuing, unification, of, italy, and, the, mounting, tension, between, adolph, and, the, rest, of, the, family, the, naples, house, closed, in, 1863, after, forty, two, years, in, business, in, 1901, the, german, branch, closed, its, doors, after, more, than, a, century, in, business, following, the, death, of, wilhelm, rothschild, with, no, male, heirs, it, was, not, until, 1989, that, the, family, returned, to, germany, when, n, m, rothschild, sons, the, british, branch, plus, bank, rothschild, ag, the, swiss, branch, set, up, a, representative, banking, office, in, frankfurt, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, the, introduction, of, national, taxation, systems, had, ended, the, rothschilds, policy, of, operating, with, a, single, set, of, commercial, account, records, which, resulted, in, the, various, branches, gradually, going, their, own, separate, ways, as, independent, banks, the, system, of, the, five, brothers, and, their, successor, sons, all, but, disappeared, by, world, war, i, the, rise, of, nazi, germany, in, the, 1930s, led, to, a, precarious, situation, for, the, austrian, rothschilds, under, the, annexation, of, austria, in, 1938, when, the, family, was, pressured, to, sell, its, banking, operation, at, a, fraction, of, its, real, worth, while, other, rothschilds, had, escaped, the, nazis, louis, rothschild, was, imprisoned, for, a, year, and, only, released, after, a, substantial, ransom, was, paid, by, his, family, after, louis, was, allowed, to, leave, the, country, in, march, 1939, the, nazis, placed, the, firm, of, s, m, von,

rothschilds, grossly, misjudged, the, opportunities, directly, across, the, atlantic, and, quoted, evelyn, de, rothschild, as, saying, that, despite, the, accomplishments, made, by, the, various, branches, of, the, family, in, international, high, finance, for, over, 200, years, we, never, seized, the, initiative, in, america, and, that, was, one, of, the, mistakes, my, family, made, in, 1816,
