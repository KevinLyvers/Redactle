entered, from, a, landing, above, the, opekta, offices, on, the, prinsengracht, where, some, of, otto, frank, s, most, trusted, employees, would, be, their, helpers, this, hiding, place, became, known, as, the, achterhuis, translated, into, secret, annex, in, english, editions, of, the, diary, their, apartment, was, left, in, a, state, of, disarray, to, create, the, impression, that, they, had, left, suddenly, and, otto, left, a, note, that, hinted, they, were, going, to, switzerland, as, jews, were, not, allowed, to, use, public, transport, otto, edith, and, anne, walked, several, kilometres, from, their, home, margot, cycled, to, the, prinsengracht, with, miep, gies, the, door, to, the, achterhuis, was, later, covered, by, a, bookcase, to, ensure, it, remained, undiscovered, victor, kugler, johannes, kleiman, miep, gies, and, bep, voskuijl, were, the, only, employees, who, knew, of, the, people, in, hiding, along, with, gies, husband, jan, gies, and, voskuijl, s, father, johannes, hendrik, voskuijl, they, were, the, helpers, for, the, duration, of, their, confinement, the, only, connection, between, the, outside, world, and, the, occupants, of, the, house, they, kept, the, occupants, informed, of, war, news, and, political, developments, they, catered, to, all, of, their, needs, ensured, their, safety, and, supplied, them, with, food, a, task, that, grew, more, difficult, over, time, frank, wrote, of, their, dedication, and, of, their, efforts, to, boost, morale, within, the, household, during, the, most, dangerous, of, times, all, were, aware, that, if, caught, they, could, face, the, death, penalty, for, sheltering, jews, on, 13, july, 1942, the, franks, were, joined, by, the, van, pels, family, made, up, of, hermann, auguste, and, 16, year, old, peter, and, then, in, november, by, fritz, pfeffer, a, dentist, and, friend, of, the, family, frank, wrote, of, her, pleasure, at, having, new, people, to, talk, to, but, tensions, quickly, developed, within, the, group, forced, to, live, in, such, confined, conditions, after, sharing, her, room, with, pfeffer, she, found, him, to, be, insufferable, and, resented, his, intrusion, and, she, clashed, with, auguste, van, pels, whom, she, regarded, as, foolish, she, regarded, hermann, van, pels, and, fritz, pfeffer, as, selfish, particularly, regarding, the, amount, of, food, they, consumed, sometime, later, after, first, dismissing, the, shy, and, awkward, peter, van, pels, she, recognized, a, kinship, with, him, and, the, two, entered, a, romance, she, received, her, first, kiss, from, him, but, her, infatuation, with, him, began, to, wane, as, she, questioned, whether, her, feelings, for, him, were, genuine, or, resulted, from, their, shared, confinement, anne, frank, formed, a, close, bond, with, each, of, the, helpers, and, otto, frank, later, recalled, that, she, had, anticipated, their, daily, visits, with, impatient, enthusiasm, he, observed, that, anne, s, closest, friendship, was, with, bep, voskuijl, the, young, typist, the, two, of, them, often, stood, whispering, in, the, corner, in, her, writing, frank, examined, her, relationships, with, the, members, of, her, family, and, the, strong, differences, in, each, of, their, personalities, she, was, closest, emotionally, to, her, father, who, later, said, i, got, on, better, with, anne, than, with, margot, who, was, more, attached, to, her, mother, the, reason, for, that, may, have, been, that, margot, rarely, showed, her, feelings, and, didn, t, need, as, much, support, because, she, didn, t, suffer, from, mood, swings, as, much, as, anne, did, the, frank, sisters, formed, a, closer, relationship, than, had, existed, before, they, went, into, hiding, although, anne, sometimes, expressed, jealousy, towards, margot, particularly, when, members, of, the, household, criticized, anne, for, lacking, margot, s, gentle, and, placid, nature, as, anne, began, to, mature, the, sisters, were, able, to, confide, in, each, other, in, her, entry, of, 12, january, 1944, frank, wrote, margot, s, much, nicer, she, s, not, nearly, so, catty, these, days, and, is, becoming, a, real, friend, she, no, longer, thinks, of, me, as, a, little, baby, who, doesn, t, count, frank, frequently, wrote, of, her, difficult, relationship, with, her, mother, and, her, ambivalence, towards, her, on, 7, november, 1942, she, described, her, contempt, for, her, mother, and, her, inability, to, confront, her, with, her, carelessness, her, sarcasm, and, her, hard, heartedness, before, concluding, she, s, not, a, mother, to, me, later, as, she, revised, her, diary, frank, felt, ashamed, of, her, harsh, attitude, writing, anne, is, it, really, you, who, mentioned, hate, oh, anne, how, could, you, she, came, to, understand, that, their, differences, resulted, from, misunderstandings, that, were, as, much, her, fault, as, her, mother, s, and, saw, that, she, had, added, unnecessarily, to, her, mother, s, suffering, with, this, realization, frank, began, to, treat, her, mother, with, a, degree, of, tolerance, and, respect, the, frank, sisters, each, hoped, to, return, to, school, as, soon, as, they, were, able, and, continued, with, their, studies, while, in, hiding, margot, took, a, course, elementary, latin, by, correspondence, in, bep, voskuijl, s, name, and, received, high, marks, most, of, anne, s, time, was, spent, reading, and, studying, and, she, regularly, wrote, and, edited, after, march, 1944, her, diary, entries, in, addition, to, providing, a, narrative, of, events, as, they, occurred, she, wrote, about, her, feelings, beliefs, dreams, and, ambitions, subjects, she, felt, she, could, not, discuss, with, anyone, as, her, confidence, in, her, writing, grew, and, as, she, began, to, mature, she, wrote, of, more, abstract, subjects, such, as, her, belief, in, god, and, how, she, defined, human, nature, frank, aspired, to, become, a, journalist, writing, in, her, diary, on, wednesday, 5, april, 1944, i, finally, realized, that, i, must, do, my, schoolwork, to, keep, from, being, ignorant, to, get, on, in, life, to, become, a, journalist, because, that, s, what, i, want, i, know, i, can, write, but, it, remains, to, be, seen, whether, i, really, have, talent, and, if, i, don, t, have, the, talent, to, write, books, or, newspaper, articles, i, can, always, write, for, myself, but, i, want, to, achieve, more, than, that, i, can, t, imagine, living, like, mother, mrs, van, daan, and, all, the, women, who, go, about, their, work, and, are, then, forgotten, i, need, to, have, something, besides, a, husband, and, children, to, devote, myself, to, i, want, to, be, useful, or, bring, enjoyment, to, all, people, even, those, i, ve, never, met, i, want, to, go, on, living, even, after, my, death, and, that, s, why, i, m, so, grateful, to, god, for, having, given, me, this, gift, which, i, can, use, to, develop, myself, and, to, express, all, that, s, inside, me, when, i, write, i, can, shake, off, all, my, cares, my, sorrow, disappears, my, spirits, are, revived, but, and, that, s, a, big, question, will, i, ever, be, able, to, write, something, great, will, i, ever, become, a, journalist, or, a, writer, she, continued, writing, regularly, until, her, last, entry, on, 1, august, 1944, on, the, morning, of, 4, august, 1944, the, achterhuis, was, stormed, by, a, group, of, german, uniformed, police, gr, ne, polizei, led, by, ss, oberscharf, hrer, karl, silberbauer, of, the, sicherheitsdienst, the, franks, van, pelses, and, pfeffer, were,

prison, on, the, weteringschans, two, days, later, they, were, transported, to, the, westerbork, transit, camp, through, which, more, than, 100, 000, jews, mostly, dutch, and, german, had, passed, having, been, arrested, in, hiding, they, were, considered, criminals, and, sent, to, the, punishment, barracks, for, hard, labour, victor, kugler, and, johannes, kleiman, were, arrested, and, jailed, at, the, penal, camp, for, enemies, of, the, regime, at, amersfoort, in, the, province, of, utrecht, kleiman, was, released, after, seven, weeks, but, kugler, was, held, in, various, dutch, concentration, and, prison, camps, until, the, war, s, end, miep, gies, was, questioned, and, threatened, by, the, security, police, but, not, detained, bep, voskuijl, managed, to, escape, with, a, few, documents, that, would, have, incriminated, their, black, market, contacts, during, the, following, days, the, two, female, secretaries, returned, to, the, achterhuis, and, found, anne, s, papers, strewn, on, the, floor, they, collected, them, as, well, as, several, family, photograph, albums, and, gies, resolved, to, return, them, to, anne, after, the, war, on, 7, august, 1944, gies, attempted, to, facilitate, the, release, of, the, prisoners, by, confronting, silberbauer, and, offering, him, money, to, intervene, but, he, refused, in, 2015, flemish, journalist, jeroen, de, bruyn, and, joop, van, wijk, bep, voskuijl, s, youngest, son, wrote, a, biography, in, which, they, alleged, that, bep, s, younger, sister, their, aunt, nelly, 1923, 2001, could, have, betrayed, the, franks, nelly, was, a, nazi, collaborator, from, the, age, of, 19, to, 23, she, had, run, away, to, austria, with, a, nazi, officer, and, returned, to, amsterdam, in, 1943, after, the, relationship, ended, nelly, had, been, critical, of, bep, and, their, father, johannes, voskuijl, for, helping, the, jews, johannes, was, the, one, who, constructed, the, bookcase, covering, the, entrance, to, the, hiding, place, and, remained, as, an, unofficial, watchman, of, the, hideout, in, one, of, their, quarrels, nelly, shouted, to, them, go, to, your, jews, karl, josef, silberbauer, the, ss, officer, who, made, the, arrest, was, reported, to, have, said, that, the, informer, had, the, voice, of, a, young, woman, in, 2016, the, anne, frank, house, published, new, research, pointing, to, an, investigation, over, ration, card, fraud, rather, than, betrayal, as, a, possible, explanation, for, the, raid, that, led, to, the, arrest, of, the, franks, the, report, stated, that, other, activities, in, the, building, may, have, led, authorities, there, including, activities, of, otto, frank, s, company, however, it, did, not, rule, out, betrayal, a, 2018, book, suggested, ans, van, dijk, a, dutch, jew, who, betrayed, at, least, 145, fellow, jews, to, the, gestapo, as, a, potential, candidate, for, the, informant, dutch, resistance, fighter, gerard, kremer, who, worked, as, a, caretaker, at, an, office, building, requisitioned, by, the, sicherheitsdienst, apparently, witnessed, van, dijk, visiting, the, building, in, august, 1944, and, overheard, her, talking, with, her, sd, superiors, about, prinsengracht, where, the, franks, were, hiding, however, another, book, examining, this, possibility, noted, that, many, of, van, dijk, s, victims, had, lived, in, or, near, prinsengracht, in, january, 2022, some, investigators, proposed, arnold, van, den, bergh, a, member, of, amsterdam, s, jewish, council, who, died, in, 1950, as, the, suspected, informant, the, investigators, postulated, that, van, den, bergh, gave, up, the, franks, to, save, his, family, the, investigation, is, chronicled, in, rosemary, sullivan, s, english, language, book, the, betrayal, of, anne, frank, a, cold, case, investigation, evidence, was, also, claimed, to, have, been, found, that, anne, frank, s, father, later, knew, this, but, did, not, reveal, it, after, the, war, according, to, the, bbc, these, investigators, spent, six, years, using, modern, investigative, techniques, to, crack, the, cold, case, however, according, to, the, new, york, times, several, world, war, ii, and, holocaust, scholars, have, doubted, the, methods, and, conclusions, of, the, investigators, calling, the, evidence, far, too, thin, shortly, after, the, publication, of, the, betrayal, of, anne, frank, after, criticism, from, scholars, bart, van, der, boom, david, barnouw, and, johannes, houwink, ten, cate, dutch, publishing, house, ambo, anthos, which, had, published, a, dutch, translation, apologized, via, an, internal, email, the, publisher, said, they, should, have, been, more, critical, and, announced, that, they, are, await, ing, the, answers, from, the, researchers, to, the, questions, that, have, emerged, and, are, delaying, the, decision, to, print, another, run, in, response, pieter, van, twisk, one, of, the, investigators, referenced, in, the, book, said, that, he, was, perplexed, by, the, email, and, that, the, investigators, had, never, claimed, to, have, uncovered, the, complete, truth, in, march, 2022, a, group, of, world, war, ii, experts, and, historians, published, their, analysis, of, the, conclusions, and, of, the, historical, sources, used, in, the, betrayal, of, anne, frank, they, contested, the, central, claim, that, the, amsterdam, jewish, council, even, had, a, list, of, jewish, hiding, places, that, van, den, bergh, could, draw, on, and, concluded, that, the, accusation, of, van, den, bergh, was, based, on, weak, assumptions, and, lack, of, historical, knowledge, as, a, result, the, dutch, language, version, of, the, book, was, recalled, by, ambo, anthos, on, 19, august, 2022, the, dutch, researcher, natasha, gerson, published, an, 80, page, report, analyzing, the, annotations, and, sources, in, the, betrayal, of, anne, frank, which, argued, that, the, theory, in, the, book, was, not, only, flawed, but, the, product, of, source, fraud, the, report, concluded, that, otto, frank, s, recorded, agenda, as, well, as, a, letter, otto, received, from, helper, johannes, kleiman, and, several, other, statements, were, proven, to, be, distorted, to, suit, the, outcome, in, the, book, several, negative, claims, about, van, den, bergh, had, anton, schepers, a, nazi, collaborator, who, was, diagnosed, twice, as, insane, and, who, had, taken, over, van, den, bergh, s, notary, practice, as, the, only, source, this, included, the, claim, of, nazi, contacts, and, a, commission, of, 200, 000, guilders, paid, on, the, sale, of, jacques, goudstikker, s, art, business, while, the, betrayal, of, anne, frank, stated, that, van, den, bergh, enjoyed, the, protection, of, two, high, up, nazis, the, cct, and, sullivan, had, omitted, statements, that, the, named, nazis, had, not, known, van, den, bergh, plans, to, publish, a, german, translation, of, sullivan, s, book, previously, postponed, were, cancelled, soon, afterward, on, 3, september, 1944, the, group, was, deported, on, what, would, be, the, last, transport, from, westerbork, to, the, auschwitz, concentration, camp, and, arrived, after, a, three, day, journey, on, the, same, train, was, bloeme, evers, emden, an, amsterdam, native, who, had, befriended, margot, and, anne, in, the, jewish, lyceum, in, 1941, bloeme, saw, anne, margot, and, their, mother, regularly, in, auschwitz, and, was, interviewed, for, her, remembrances, of, the, frank, women, in, auschwitz, in, the, television, documentary, the, last, seven, months,

1959, which, was, a, critical, and, commercial, success, biographer, melissa, m, ller, later, wrote, that, the, dramatization, had, contributed, greatly, to, the, romanticizing, sentimentalizing, and, universalizing, of, anne, s, story, over, the, years, the, popularity, of, the, diary, grew, and, in, many, schools, particularly, in, the, united, states, it, was, included, as, part, of, the, curriculum, introducing, anne, frank, to, new, generations, of, readers, cornelis, suijk, a, former, director, of, the, anne, frank, foundation, and, president, of, the, u, s, center, for, holocaust,

editions, of, the, diary, the, diary, has, been, praised, for, its, literary, merits, commenting, on, anne, frank, s, writing, style, the, dramatist, meyer, levin, commended, frank, for, sustaining, the, tension, of, a, well, constructed, novel, and, was, so, impressed, by, the, quality, of, her, work, that, he, collaborated, with, otto, frank, on, a, dramatization, of, the, diary, shortly, after, its, publication, levin, became, obsessed, with, anne, frank, which, he, wrote, about, in, his, autobiography, the, obsession, the, poet, john, berryman, called, the, book, a, unique, depiction, not, merely, of, adolescence, but, of, the, conversion, of, a, child, into, a, person, as, it, is, happening, in, a, precise, confident, economical, style, stunning, in, its, honesty, in, her, introduction, to, the, diary, s, first, american, edition, eleanor, roosevelt, described, it, as, one, of, the, wisest, and, most, moving, commentaries, on, war, and, its, impact, on, human, beings, that, i, have, ever, read, john, f, kennedy, discussed, anne, frank, in, a, 1961, speech, and, said, of, all, the, multitudes, who, throughout, history, have, spoken, for, human, dignity, in, times, of, great, suffering, and, loss, no, voice, is, more, compelling, than, that, of, anne, frank, in, the, same, year, the, soviet, writer, ilya, ehrenburg, wrote, of, her, one, voice, speaks, for, six, million, the, voice, not, of, a, sage, or, a, poet, but, of, an, ordinary, little, girl, as, anne, frank, s, stature, as, both, a, writer, and, humanist, has, grown, she, has, been, discussed, specifically, as, a, symbol, of, the, holocaust, and, more, broadly, as, a, representative, of, persecution, hillary, clinton, in, her, acceptance, speech, for, an, elie, wiesel, humanitarian, award, in, 1994, read, from, anne, frank, s, diary, and, spoke, of, her, awakening, us, to, the, folly, of, indifference, and, the, terrible, toll, it, takes, on, our, young, which, clinton, related, to, contemporary, events, in, sarajevo, somalia, and, rwanda, after, receiving, a, humanitarian, award, from, the, anne, frank, foundation, in, 1994, nelson, mandela, addressed, a, crowd, in, johannesburg, saying, he, had, read, anne, frank, s, diary, while, in, prison, and, derived, much, encouragement, from, it, he, likened, her, struggle, against, nazism, to, his, struggle, against, apartheid, drawing, a, parallel, between, the, two, philosophies, because, these, beliefs, are, patently, false, and, because, they, were, and, will, always, be, challenged, by, the, likes, of, anne, frank, they, are, bound, to, fail, also, in, 1994, v, clav, havel, said, anne, frank, s, legacy, is, very, much, alive, and, it, can, address, us, fully, about, the, political, and, social, changes, occurring, at, the, time, in, former, eastern, bloc, countries, primo, levi, suggested, anne, frank, is, frequently, identified, as, a, single, representative, of, the, millions, of, people, who, suffered, and, died, as, she, did, because, one, single, anne, frank, moves, us, more, than, the, countless, others, who, suffered, just, as, she, did, but, whose, faces, have, remained, in, the, shadows, perhaps, it, is, better, that, way, if, we, were, capable, of, taking, in, all, the, suffering, of, all, those, people, we, would, not, be, able, to, live, in, her, closing, message, in, m, ller, s, biography, of, anne, frank, miep, gies, expressed, a, similar, thought, though, she, attempted, to, dispel, what, she, felt, was, a, growing, misconception, that, anne, symbolizes, the, six, million, victims, of, the, holocaust, writing, anne, s, life, and, death, were, her, own, individual, fate, an, individual, fate, that, happened, six, million, times, over, anne, cannot, and, should, not, stand, for, the, many, individuals, whom, the, nazis, robbed, of, their, lives, but, her, fate, helps, us, grasp, the, immense, loss, the, world, suffered, because, of, the, holocaust, otto, frank, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, as, custodian, of, his, daughter, s, legacy, saying, it, s, a, strange, role, in, the, normal, family, relationship, it, is, the, child, of, the, famous, parent, who, has, the, honour, and, the, burden, of, continuing, the, task, in, my, case, the, role, is, reversed, he, recalled, his, publisher, s, explaining, why, he, thought, the, diary, has, been, so, widely, read, with, the, comment, he, said, that, the, diary, encompasses, so, many, areas, of, life, that, each, reader, can, find, something, that, moves, him, personally, simon, wiesenthal, expressed, a, similar, sentiment, when, he, said, that, the, diary, had, raised, more, widespread, awareness, of, the, holocaust, than, had, been, achieved, during, the, nuremberg, trials, because, people, identified, with, this, child, this, was, the, impact, of, the, holocaust, this, was, a, family, like, my, family, like, your, family, and, so, you, could, understand, this, in, june, 1999, time, magazine, published, a, special, edition, titled, time, 100, the, most, important, people, of, the, century, anne, frank, was, selected, as, one, of, the, heroes, icons, and, the, writer, roger, rosenblatt, described, her, legacy, with, the, comment, the, passions, the, book, ignites, suggest, that, everyone, owns, anne, frank, that, she, has, risen, above, the, holocaust, judaism, girlhood, and, even, goodness, and, become, a, totemic, figure, of, the, modern, world, the, moral, individual, mind, beset, by, the, machinery, of, destruction, insisting, on, the, right, to, live, and, question, and, hope, for, the, future, of, human, beings, he, notes, that, while, her, courage, and, pragmatism, are, admired, her, ability, to, analyse, herself, and, the, quality, of, her, writing, are, the, key, components, of, her, appeal, he, writes, the, reason, for, her, immortality, was, basically, literary, she, was, an, extraordinarily, good, writer, for, any, age, and, the, quality, of, her, work, seemed, a, direct, result, of, a, ruthlessly, honest, disposition, after, the, diary, became, widely, known, in, the, late, 1950s, various, allegations, against, the, veracity, of, the, diary, and, its, contents, appeared, with, the, earliest, published, criticisms, occurring, in, sweden, and, norway, in, 1957, fria, ord, free, words, the, magazine, of, the, swedish, neofascist,
