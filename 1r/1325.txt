al, nahda, where, he, received, his, leaving, certificate, later, that, year, aburish, asserts, that, nasser, was, not, distressed, by, his, frequent, relocations, which, broadened, his, horizons, and, showed, him, egyptian, society, s, class, divisions, his, own, social, status, was, well, below, the, wealthy, egyptian, elite, and, his, discontent, with, those, born, into, wealth, and, power,

instructor, at, the, royal, military, academy, aziz, al, masri, to, whom, nasser, expressed, his, gratitude, in, a, 1961, newspaper, interview, he, was, especially, influenced, by, egyptian, writer, tawfiq, al, hakim, s, novel, return, of, the, spirit, in, which, al, hakim, wrote, that, the, egyptian, people, were, only, in, need, of, a, man, in, whom, all, their, feelings, and, desires, will, be, represented, and, who, will, be, for, them, a, symbol, of, their, objective, nasser, later, credited, the, novel, as, his, inspiration, to, launch, the, coup, d, tat, that, began, the, egyptian, revolution, of, 1952, in, 1937, nasser, applied, to, the, royal, military, academy, for, army, officer, training, but, his, police, record, of, anti, government, protest, initially, blocked, his,

frequently, spoke, of, dignity, glory, and, freedom, in, his, youth, became, enchanted, with, the, stories, of, national, liberators, and, heroic, conquerors, a, military, career, became, his, chief, priority, convinced, that, he, needed, a, wasta, or, an, influential, intermediary, to, promote, his, application, above, the, others, nasser, managed, to, secure, a, meeting, with, under, secretary, of, war, ibrahim, khairy, pasha, the, person, responsible, for, the, academy, s, selection, board, and, requested, his, help, khairy, pasha, agreed, and, sponsored, nasser, s, second, application,

and, posted, to, mankabad, it, was, here, that, nasser, and, his, closest, comrades, including, sadat, and, amer, first, discussed, their, dissatisfaction, at, widespread, corruption, in, the, country, and, their, desire, to, topple, the, monarchy, sadat, would, later, write, that, because, of, his, energy, clear, thinking, and, balanced, judgement, nasser, emerged, as, the, group, s, natural, leader, in, 1941, nasser, was, posted, to, khartoum, sudan, which, was, part, of, egypt, at, the, time, nasser, returned, to, egypt, in, september, 1942, after, a, brief, stay, in, sudan,

bombardment, of, his, palace, his, removal, as, king, and, his, exile, from, egypt, unless, he, conceded, to, the, british, demands, ultimately, the, 22, year, old, king, submitted, and, appointed, el, nahas, nasser, saw, the, incident, as, a, blatant, violation, of, egyptian, sovereignty, and, wrote, i, am, ashamed, that, our, army, has, not, reacted, against, this, attack, and, wished, for, calamity, to, overtake, the, british, nasser, was, accepted, into, the, general, staff, college, later, that, year, he, began, to, form, a, group, of, young, military, officers, with, strong, nationalist, sentiments, who, supported, some, form, of, revolution, nasser, stayed, in, touch, with, the, group, s, members, primarily, through, amer, who, continued, to, seek, out, interested, officers, within, the, egyptian, armed, force, s, various, branches, and, presented, nasser, with, a, complete, file, on, each, of, them, nasser, s, first, battlefield, experience, was, in, palestine,

husayni, but, was, ultimately, refused, entry, to, the, ahc, s, forces, by, the, egyptian, government, for, reasons, that, were, unclear, in, may, 1948, following, the, british, withdrawal, king, farouk, sent, the, egyptian, army, into, israel, with, nasser, serving, as, a, staff, officer, of, the, 6th, infantry, battalion, during, the, war, he, wrote, of, the, egyptian, army, s, unpreparedness, saying, our, soldiers, were, dashed, against, fortifications, nasser, was, deputy, commander, of, the, egyptian, forces, that, secured, the, faluja, pocket, commanded, by, said, taha, bey, nicknamed, the, sudanese, tiger, by, the, israelis, on, 12, july, he, was, lightly, wounded, in, the, fighting, by, august, his, brigade, was, surrounded, by, the, israeli, army, appeals, for, help, from, transjordan, s, arab, legion, went, unheeded, but, the, brigade, refused, to, surrender, negotiations, between, israel, and, egypt, finally, resulted, in, the, ceding, of, faluja, to, israel, according, to, veteran, journalist, eric, margolis, the, defenders, of, faluja, including, young, army, officer, gamal, abdel, nasser, became, national, heroes, for, enduring, israeli, bombardment, while, isolated, from, their, command, still, stationed, after, the, war, in, the, faluja, enclave, nasser, agreed, to, an, israeli, request, to, identify, 67, killed, soldiers, of, the, religious, platoon, the, expedition, was, led, by, rabbi, shlomo, goren, and, nasser, personally, accompanied, him, ordering, the, egyptian, soldiers, to, stand, at, attention, they, spoke, briefly, and, according, to, goren, after, learning, what, the, square, phylacteries, found, with, the, soldiers, were, nasser, told, him, that, he, now, understands, their, courageous, stand, during, an, interview, on, israeli, tv, in, 1971, rabbi, goren, claimed, the, two, agreed, to, meet, again, when, the, time, of, peace, comes, the, egyptian, singer, umm, kulthum, hosted, a, public, celebration, for, the, officers, return, despite, reservations, from, the, royal, government, which, had, been, pressured, by, the, british, to, prevent, the, reception, the, apparent, difference, in, attitude, between, the, government, and, the, general, public, increased, nasser, s, determination, to, topple, the, monarchy, nasser, had, also, felt, bitter, that, his, brigade, had, not, been, relieved, despite, the, resilience, it, displayed, he, started, writing, his, book, philosophy, of, the, revolution, during, the, siege, after, the, war, nasser, returned, to, his, role, as, an, instructor, at, the, royal, military, academy, he, sent, emissaries, to, forge, an, alliance, with, the, muslim, brotherhood, in, october, 1948, but, soon, concluded, that, the, religious, agenda, of, the, brotherhood, was, not, compatible, with, his, nationalism, from, then, on, nasser, prevented, the, brotherhood, s, influence, over, his, cadres, activities, without, severing, ties, with, the, organization, nasser, was, sent, as, a, member, of, the, egyptian, delegation, to, rhodes, in, february, 1949, to, negotiate, a, formal, armistice, with, israel, and, reportedly, considered, the, terms, to, be, humiliating, particularly, because, the, israelis, were, able, to, easily, occupy, the, eilat, region, while, negotiating, with, the, arabs, in, march, nasser, s, return, to, egypt, coincided, with, husni, al, za, im, s, syrian, coup, d, tat, its, success, and, evident, popular, support, among, the, syrian, people, encouraged, nasser, s, revolutionary, pursuits, soon, after, his, return, he, was, summoned, and, interrogated, by, prime, minister, ibrahim, abdel, hadi, regarding, suspicions, that, he, was, forming, a, secret, group, of, dissenting, officers, according, to, secondhand, reports, nasser, convincingly, denied, the, allegations, abdel, hadi, was, also, hesitant, to, take, drastic, measures, against, the, army, especially, in, front, of, its, chief, of, staff, who, was, present, during, the, interrogation, and, subsequently, released, nasser, the, interrogation, pushed, nasser, to, speed, up, his, group, s, activities, after, 1949, the, group, adopted, the, name, association, of, free, officers, and, advocated, little, else, but, freedom, and, the, restoration, of, their, country, s, dignity, nasser, organized, the, free, officers, founding, committee, which, eventually, comprised, fourteen, men, from, different, social, and, political, backgrounds, including, representation, from, young, egypt, the, muslim, brotherhood, the, egyptian, communist, party, and, the, aristocracy, nasser, was, unanimously, elected, chairman, of, the, organization, in, the, 1950, parliamentary, elections, the, wafd, party, of, el, nahhas, gained, a, victory, mostly, due, to, the, absence, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, which, boycotted, the, elections, and, was, perceived, as, a, threat, by, the, free, officers, as, the, wafd, had, campaigned, on, demands, similar, to, their, own, accusations, of, corruption, against, wafd, politicians, began, to, surface, however, breeding, an, atmosphere, of, rumor, and, suspicion, that, consequently, brought, the, free, officers, to, the, forefront, of, egyptian, politics, by, then, the, organization, had, expanded, to, around, ninety, members, according, to, khaled, mohieddin, nobody, knew, all, of, them, and, where, they, belonged, in, the, hierarchy, except, nasser, nasser, felt, that, the, free, officers, were, not, ready, to, move, against, the, government, and, for, nearly, two, years, he, did, little, beyond, officer, recruitment, and, underground, news, bulletins, on, 11, october, 1951, the, wafd, government, abrogated, the, unpopular, anglo, egyptian, treaty, of, 1936, by, which, the, united, kingdom, had, the, right, to, maintain, its, military, forces, in, the, suez, canal, zone, the, popularity, of, this, move, as, well, as, that, of, government, sponsored, guerrilla, attacks, against, the, british, put, pressure, on, nasser, to, act, according, to, sadat, nasser, decided, to, wage, a, large, scale, assassination, campaign, in, january, 1952, he, and, hassan, ibrahim, attempted, to, kill, the, royalist, general, hussein, sirri, amer, by, firing, their, submachine, guns, at, his, car, as, he, drove, through, the, streets, of, cairo, instead, of, killing, the, general, the, attackers, wounded, an, innocent, female, passerby, nasser, recalled, that, her, wails, haunted, him, and, firmly, dissuaded, him, from, undertaking, similar, actions, in, the, future, sirri, amer, was, close, to, king, farouk, and, was, nominated, for, the, presidency, of, the, officer, s, club, normally, a, ceremonial, office, with, the, king, s, backing, nasser, was, determined, to, establish, the, independence, of, the, army, from, the, monarchy, and, with, amer, as, the, intercessor, resolved, to, field, a, nominee, for, the, free, officers, they, selected, mohamed, naguib, a, popular, general, who, had, offered, his, resignation, to, farouk, in, 1942, over, british, high, handedness, and, was, wounded, three, times, in, the, palestine, war, naguib, won, overwhelmingly, and, the, free, officers, through, their, connection, with, a, leading, egyptian, daily, al, misri, publicized, his, victory, while, praising, the, nationalistic, spirit, of, the, army, on, 25, january, 1952, at, a, time, of, growing, fedayeen, attacks, on, british, forces, occupying, the, suez, canal, zone, some, 7, 000, british, soldiers, attacked, the, main, police, station, in, the, canal, city, ismailia, in, the, ensuing, battle, which, lasted, two, hours, 50, egyptian, policeman, were, killed, sparking, outrage, across, egypt, and, the, cairo, fire, riots, which, left, 76, people, dead, afterwards, nasser, published, a, simple, six, point, program, in, rose, al, y, suf, to, dismantle, feudalism, and, british, influence, in, egypt, in, may, nasser, received, word, that, farouk, knew, the, names, of, the, free, officers, and, intended, to, arrest, them, he, immediately, entrusted, free, officer, zakaria, mohieddin, with, the, task, of, planning, the, government, takeover, by, army, units, loyal, to, the, association, the, free, officers, intention, was, not, to, install, themselves, in, government, but, to, re, establish, a, parliamentary, democracy, nasser, did, not, believe, that, a, low, ranking, officer, like, himself, a, lieutenant, colonel, would, be, accepted, by, the, egyptian, people, and, so, selected, general, naguib, to, be, his, boss, and, lead, the, coup, in, name, the, revolution, they, had, long, sought, was, launched, on, 22, july, and, was, declared, a, success, the, next, day, the, free, officers, seized, control, of, all, government, buildings, radio, stations, and, police, stations, as, well, as, army, headquarters, in, cairo, while, many, of, the, rebel, officers, were, leading, their, units, nasser, donned, civilian, clothing, to, avoid, detection, by, royalists, and, moved, around, cairo, monitoring, the, situation, in, a, move, to, stave, off, foreign, intervention, two, days, before, the, revolution, nasser, had, notified, the, american, and, british, governments, of, his, intentions, and, both, had, agreed, not, to, aid, farouk, under, pressure, from, the, americans, nasser, had, agreed, to, exile, the, deposed, king, with, an, honorary, ceremony, on, 18, june, 1953, the, monarchy, was, abolished, and, the, republic, of, egypt, declared, with, naguib, as, its, first, president, according, to, aburish, after, assuming, power, nasser, and, the, free, officers, expected, to, become, the, guardians, of, the, people, s, interests, against, the, monarchy, and, the, pasha, class, while, leaving, the, day, to, day, tasks, of, government, to, civilians, they, asked, former, prime, minister, ali, maher, to, accept, reappointment, to, his, previous, position, and, to, form, an, all, civilian, cabinet, the, free, officers, then, governed, as, the, revolutionary, command, council, rcc, with, naguib, as, chairman, and, nasser, as, vice, chairman, relations, between, the, rcc, and, maher, grew, tense, however, as, the, latter, viewed, many, of, nasser, s, schemes, agrarian, reform, abolition, of, the, monarchy, reorganization, of, political, parties, as, too, radical, culminating, in, maher, s, resignation, on, 7, september, naguib, assumed, the, additional, role, of, prime, minister, and, nasser, that, of, deputy, prime, minister, in, september, the, agrarian, reform, law, was, put, into, effect, in, nasser, s, eyes, this, law, gave, the, rcc, its, own, identity, and, transformed, the, coup, into, a, revolution, preceding, the, reform, law, in, august, 1952, communist, led, riots, broke, out, at, textile, factories, in, kafr, el, dawwar, leading, to, a, clash, with, the, army, that, left, nine, people, dead, while, most, of, the, rcc, insisted, on, executing, the, riot, s, two, ringleaders, nasser, opposed, this, nonetheless, the, sentences, were, carried, out, the, muslim, brotherhood, supported, the, rcc, and, after, naguib, s, assumption, of, power, demanded, four, ministerial, portfolios, in, the, new, cabinet, nasser, turned, down, their, demands, and, instead, hoped, to, co, opt, the, brotherhood, by, giving, two, of, its, members, who, were, willing, to, serve, officially, as, independents, minor, ministerial, posts, in, january, 1953, nasser, overcame, opposition, from, naguib, and, banned, all, political, parties, creating, a, one, party, system, under, the, liberation, rally, a, loosely, structured, movement, whose, chief, task, was, to, organize, pro, rcc, rallies, and, lectures, with, nasser, its, secretary, general, despite, the, dissolution, order, nasser, was, the, only, rcc, member, who, still, favored, holding, parliamentary, elections, according, to, his, fellow, officer, abdel, latif, boghdadi, although, outvoted, he, still, advocated, holding, elections, by, 1956, in, march, 1953, nasser, led, the, egyptian, delegation, negotiating, a, british, withdrawal, from, the, suez, canal, when, naguib, began,

immediately, followed, demanding, naguib, s, reinstatement, and, the, rcc, s, dissolution, while, visiting, the, striking, officers, at, military, headquarters, ghq, to, call, for, the, mutiny, s, end, nasser, was, initially, intimidated, into, accepting, their, demands, however, on, 27, february, nasser, s, supporters, in, the, army, launched, a, raid, on, the, ghq, ending, the, mutiny, later, that, day, hundreds, of, thousands, of, protesters, mainly, belonging, to, the, brotherhood, called, for, naguib, s, return, and, nasser, s, imprisonment, in, response, a, sizable, group, within, the, rcc, led, by, khaled, mohieddin, demanded, naguib, s, release, and, return, to, the, presidency, nasser, acquiesced, but, delayed, naguib, s, reinstatement, until, 4, march, allowing, him, to, promote, amer, to, commander, of, the, armed, forces, a, position, formerly, occupied, by, naguib, on, 5, march, nasser, s, security, coterie, arrested, thousands, of, participants, in, the, uprising, as, a, ruse, to, rally, opposition, against, a, return, to, the, pre, 1952, order, the, rcc, decreed, an, end, to, restrictions, on, monarchy, era, parties, and, the, free, officers, withdrawal, from,

workers, launching, a, strike, and, thousands, of, peasants, entering, cairo, in, protest, in, late, march, naguib, sought, to, crack, down, on, the, protesters, but, his, requests, were, rebuffed, by, the, heads, of, the, security, forces, on, 29, march, nasser, announced, the, decrees, revocation, in, response, to, the, impulse, of, the, street, between, april, and, june, hundreds, of, naguib, s, supporters, in, the, military, were, either, arrested, or, dismissed, and, mohieddin, was, informally, exiled, to, switzerland, to, represent, the, rcc, abroad, king, saud, of, saudi, arabia, attempted, to, mend, relations, between, nasser, and, naguib, but, to, no, avail, on, 26, october, 1954, muslim, brotherhood, member, mahmoud, abdel, latif, attempted, to, assassinate, nasser, while, he, was, delivering, a, speech, in, alexandria, broadcast, to, the, arab, world, by, radio, to, celebrate, the, british, military, withdrawal, the, gunman, was, 25, feet, 7, 6, m, away, from, him, and, fired, eight, shots, but, all, missed, nasser, panic, broke, out, in, the, mass, audience, but, nasser, maintained, his, posture, and, raised, his, voice, to, appeal, for, calm, with, great, emotion, he, exclaimed, the, following, my, countrymen, my, blood, spills, for, you, and, for, egypt, i, will, live, for, your, sake, and, die, for, the, sake, of, your, freedom, and, honor, let, them, kill, me, it, does, not, concern, me, so, long, as, i, have, instilled, pride, honor, and, freedom, in, you, if, gamal, abdel, nasser, should, die, each, of, you, shall, be, gamal, abdel, nasser, gamal, abdel, nasser, is, of, you, and, from, you, and, he, is, willing, to, sacrifice, his, life, for, the, nation, the, crowd, roared, in, approval, and, arab, audiences, were, electrified, the, assassination, attempt, backfired, quickly, playing, into, nasser, s, hands, upon, returning, to, cairo, he, ordered, one, of, the, largest, political, crackdowns, in, the, modern, history, of, egypt, with, the, arrests, of, thousands, of, dissenters, mostly, members, of, the, brotherhood, but, also, communists, and, the, dismissal, of, 140, officers, loyal, to, naguib, eight, brotherhood, leaders, were, sentenced, to, death, although, the, sentence, of, its, chief, ideologue, sayyid, qutb, was, commuted, to, a, 15, year, imprisonment, naguib, was, removed, from, the, presidency, and, put, under, house, arrest, but, was, never, tried, or, sentenced, and, no, one, in, the, army, rose, to, defend, him, with, his, rivals, neutralized, nasser, became, the, undisputed, leader, of, egypt, nasser, s, street, following, was, still, too, small, to, sustain, his, plans, for, reform, and, to, secure, him, in, office, to, promote, himself, and, the, liberation, rally, he, gave, speeches, in, a, cross, country, tour, and, imposed, controls, over, the, country, s, press, by, decreeing, that, all, publications, had, to, be, approved, by, the, party, to, prevent, sedition, both, umm, kulthum, and, abdel, halim, hafez, the, leading, arab, singers, of, the, era, performed, songs, praising, nasser, s, nationalism, others, produced, plays, denigrating, his, political, opponents, according, to, his, associates, nasser, orchestrated, the, campaign, himself, arab, nationalist, terms, such, arab, homeland, and, arab, nation, frequently, began, appearing, in, his, speeches, in, 1954, 55, whereas, prior, he, would, refer, to, the, arab, peoples, or, the, arab, region, in, january, 1955, the, rcc, appointed, him, as, their, president, pending, national, elections, nasser, made, secret, contacts, with, israel, in, 1954, 55, but, determined, that, peace, with, israel, would, be, impossible, considering, it, an, expansionist, state, that, viewed, the, arabs, with, disdain, on, 28, february, 1955, israeli, troops, attacked, the, egyptian, held, gaza, strip, with, the, stated, aim, of, suppressing, palestinian, fedayeen, raids, nasser, did, not, feel, that, the, egyptian, army, was, ready, for, a, confrontation, and, did, not, retaliate, militarily, his, failure, to, respond, to, israeli, military, action, demonstrated, the, ineffectiveness, of, his, armed, forces, and, constituted, a, blow, to, his, growing, popularity, nasser, subsequently, ordered, the, tightening, of, the, blockade, on, israeli, shipping, through, the, straits, of, tiran, and, restricted, the, use, of, airspace, over, the, gulf, of, aqaba, by, israeli, aircraft, in, early, september, the, israelis, re, militarized, the, al, auja, demilitarized, zone, on, the, egyptian, border, on, 21, september, simultaneous, with, israel, s, february, raid, the, baghdad, pact, was, formed, between, some, regional, allies, of, the, uk, nasser, considered, the, baghdad, pact, a, threat, to, his, efforts, to, eliminate, british, military, influence, in, the, middle, east, and, a, mechanism, to, undermine, the, arab, league, and, perpetuate, subservience, to, zionism, and, imperialism, nasser, felt, that, if, he, was, to, maintain, egypt, s, regional, leadership, position, he, needed, to, acquire, modern, weaponry, to, arm, his, military, when, it, became, apparent, to, him, that, western, countries, would, not, supply, egypt, under, acceptable, financial, and, military, terms, nasser, turned, to, the, eastern, bloc, and, concluded, a, us, 320, 000, 000, armaments, agreement, with, czechoslovakia, on, 27, september, through, the, czechoslovakian, arms, deal, the, balance, of, power, between, egypt, and, israel, was, more, or, less, equalized, and, nasser, s, role, as, the, arab, leader, defying, the, west, was, enhanced, the, arms, deal, led, to, increased, unease, in, the, united, states, where, nasser, was, compared, to, benito, mussolini, and, adolf, hitler, causing, it, to, strengthen, its, relations, with, israel, and, become, more, wary, of, egypt, as, a, result, at, the, bandung, conference, in, indonesia, in, late, april, 1955, nasser, was, treated, as, the, leading, representative, of, the, arab, countries, and, was, one, of, the, most, popular, figures, at, the, summit, he, had, paid, earlier, visits, to, pakistan, 9, april, india, 14, april, burma, and, afghanistan, on, the, way, to, bandung, and, previously, cemented, a, treaty, of, friendship, with, india, in, cairo, on, 6, april, strengthening, egyptian, indian, relations, on, the, international, policy, and, economic, development, fronts, nasser, mediated, discussions, between, the, pro, western, pro, soviet, and, neutralist, conference, factions, over, the, composition, of, the, final, communique, addressing, colonialism, in, africa, and, asia, and, the, fostering, of, global, peace, amid, the, cold, war, between, the, west, and, the, soviet, union, at, bandung, nasser, sought, a, proclamation, for, the, avoidance, of, international, defense, alliances, support, for, the, independence, of, tunisia, algeria, and, morocco, from, french, rule, support, for, the, palestinian, right, of, return, and, the, implementation, of, un, resolutions, regarding, the, arab, israeli, conflict, he, succeeded, in, lobbying, the, attendees, to, pass, resolutions, on, each, of, these, issues, notably, securing, the, strong, support, of, china, and, india, following, bandung, nasser, officially, adopted, the, positive, neutralism, of, yugoslavian, president, josip, broz, tito, and, indian, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, as, a, principal, theme, of, egyptian, foreign, policy, regarding, the, cold, war, nasser, was, welcomed, by, large, crowds, of, people, lining, the, streets, of, cairo, on, his, return, to, egypt, on, 2, may, and, was, widely, heralded, in, the, press, for, his, achievements, and, leadership, in, the, conference, consequently, nasser, s, prestige, was, greatly, boosted, as, was, his, self, confidence, and, image, with, his, domestic, position, considerably, strengthened, nasser, was, able, to, secure, primacy, over, his, rcc, colleagues, and, gained, relatively, unchallenged, decision, making, authority, particularly, over, foreign, policy, in, january, 1956, the, new, constitution, of, egypt, was, drafted, entailing, the, establishment, of, a, single, party, system, under, the, national, union, nu, a, movement, nasser, described, as, the, cadre, through, which, we, will, realize, our, revolution, the, nu, was, a, reconfiguration, of, the, liberation, rally, which, nasser, determined, had, failed, in, generating, mass, public, participation, in, the, new, movement, nasser, attempted, to, incorporate, more, citizens, approved, by, local, level, party, committees, in, order, to, solidify, popular, backing, for, his, government, the, nu, would, select, a, nominee, for, the, presidential, election, whose, name, would, be, provided, for, public, approval, nasser, s, nomination, for, the, post, and, the, new, constitution, were, put, to, public, referendum, on, 23, june, and, each, was, approved, by, an, overwhelming, majority, a, 350, member, national, assembly, was, established, elections, for, which, were, held, in, july, 1957, nasser, had, ultimate, approval, over, all, the, candidates, the, constitution, granted, women, s, suffrage, prohibited, discrimination, by, sex, and, entailed, special, protection, for, women, in, the, workplace, coinciding, with, the, new, constitution, and, nasser, s, presidency, the, rcc, dissolved, itself, and, its, members, resigned, their, military, commissions, as, part, of, the, transition, to, civilian, rule, during, the, deliberations, surrounding, the, establishment, of, a, new, government, nasser, began, a, process, of, sidelining, his, rivals, among, the, original, free, officers, while, elevating, his, closest, allies, to, high, ranking, positions, in, the, cabinet, after, the, three, year, transition, period, ended, with, nasser, s, official, assumption, of, power, his, domestic, and, independent, foreign, policies, increasingly, collided, with, the, regional, interests, of, the, uk, and, france, the, latter, condemned, his, strong, support, for, algerian, independence, and, the, uk, s, eden, government, was, agitated, by, nasser, s, campaign, against, the, baghdad, pact, in, addition, nasser, s, adherence, to, neutralism, regarding, the, cold, war, recognition, of, communist, china, and, arms, deal, with, the, eastern, bloc, alienated, the, united, states, on, 19, july, 1956, the, us, and, uk, abruptly, withdrew, their, offer, to, finance, construction, of, the, aswan, dam, citing, concerns, that, egypt, s, economy, would, be, overwhelmed, by, the, project, nasser, was, informed, of, the, british, american, withdrawal, in, a, news, statement, while, aboard, a, plane, returning, to, cairo, from, belgrade, and, took, great, offense, although, ideas, for, nationalizing, the, suez, canal, company, were, in, the, offing, after, the, uk, agreed, to, withdraw, its, military, from, egypt, in, 1954, the, last, british, troops, left, on, 13, june, 1956, journalist, mohamed, hassanein, heikal, asserts, that, nasser, made, the, final, decision, to, nationalize, the, company, that, operated, the, waterway, between, 19, and, 20, july, nasser, himself, would, later, state, that, he, decided, on, 23, july, after, studying, the, issue, and, deliberating, with, some, of, his, advisers, from, the, dissolved, rcc, namely, boghdadi, and, technical, specialist, mahmoud, younis, beginning, on, 21, july, the, rest, of, the, rcc, s, former, members, were, informed, of, the, decision, on, 24, july, while, the, bulk, of, the, cabinet, was, unaware, of, the, nationalization, scheme, until, hours, before, nasser, publicly, announced, it, according, to, ramadan, nasser, s, decision, to, nationalize, the, canal, was, a, solitary, decision, taken, without, consultation, on, 26, july, 1956, nasser, gave, a, speech, in, alexandria, announcing, the, nationalization, of, the, suez, canal, company, as, a, means, to, fund, the, aswan, dam, project, in, light, of, the, british, american, withdrawal, in, the, speech, he, denounced, british, imperialism, in, egypt, and, british, control, over, the, canal, company, s, profits, and, upheld, that, the, egyptian, people, had, a, right, to, sovereignty, over, the, waterway, especially, since, 120, 000, egyptians, had, died, building, it, the, motion, was, technically, in, breach, of, the, international, agreement, he, had, signed, with, the, uk, on, 19, october, 1954, although, he, ensured, that, all, existing, stockholders, would, be, paid, off, the, nationalization, announcement, was, greeted, very, emotionally, by, the, audience, and, throughout, the, arab, world, thousands, entered, the, streets, shouting, slogans, of, support, us, ambassador, henry, a, byroade, stated, i, cannot, overemphasize, popularity, of, the, canal, company, nationalization, within, egypt, even, among, nasser, s, enemies, egyptian, political, scientist, mahmoud, hamad, wrote, that, prior, to, 1956, nasser, had, consolidated, control, over, egypt, s, military, and, civilian, bureaucracies, but, it, was, only, after, the, canal, s, nationalization, that, he, gained, near, total, popular, legitimacy, and, firmly, established, himself, as, the, charismatic, leader, and, spokesman, for, the, masses, not, only, in, egypt, but, all, over, the, third, world, according, to, aburish, this, was, nasser, s, largest, pan, arab, triumph, at, the, time, and, soon, his, pictures, were, to, be, found, in, the, tents, of, yemen, the, souks, of, marrakesh, and, the, posh, villas, of, syria, the, official, reason, given, for, the, nationalization, was, that, funds, from, the, canal, would, be, used, for, the, construction, of, the, dam, in, aswan, that, same, day, egypt, closed, the, canal, to, israeli, shipping, france, and, the, uk, the, largest, shareholders, in, the, suez, canal, company, saw, its, nationalization, as, yet, another, hostile, measure, aimed, at, them, by, the, egyptian, government, nasser, was, aware, that, the, canal, s, nationalization, would, instigate, an, international, crisis, and, believed, the, prospect, of, military, intervention, by, the, two, countries, was, 80, percent, likely, nasser, dismissed, their, claims, and, believed, that, the, uk, would, not, be, able, to, intervene, militarily, for, at, least, two, months, after, the, announcement, and, dismissed, israeli, action, as, impossible, in, early, october, the, un, security, council, met, on, the, matter, of, the, canal, s, nationalization, and, adopted, a, resolution, recognizing, egypt, s, right, to, control, the, canal, as, long, as, it, continued, to, allow, passage, through, it, for, foreign, ships, according, to, heikal, after, this, agreement, nasser, estimated, that, the, danger, of, invasion, had, dropped, to, 10, percent, shortly, thereafter, however, the, uk, france, and, israel, made, a, secret, agreement, to, take, over, the, suez, canal, occupy, the, suez, canal, zone, and, topple, nasser, on, 29, october, 1956, israeli, forces, crossed, the, sinai, peninsula, overwhelmed, egyptian, army, posts, and, quickly, advanced, to, their, objectives, two, days, later, british, and, french, planes, bombarded, egyptian, airfields, in, the, canal, zone, nasser, ordered, the, military, s, high, command, to, withdraw, the, egyptian, army, from, sinai, to, bolster, the, canal, s, defenses, moreover, he, feared, that, if, the, armored, corps, was, dispatched, to, confront, the, israeli, invading, force, and, the, british, and, french, subsequently, landed, in, the, canal, city, of, port, said, egyptian, armor, in, the, sinai, would, be, cut, off, from, the, canal, and, destroyed, by, the, combined, tripartite, forces, amer, strongly, disagreed, insisting, that, egyptian, tanks, meet, the, israelis, in, battle, the, two, had, a, heated, exchange, on, 3, november, and, amer, conceded, nasser, also, ordered, blockage, of, the, canal, by, sinking, or, otherwise, disabling, forty, nine, ships, at, its, entrance, despite, the, commanded, withdrawal, of, egyptian, troops, about, 2, 000, egyptian, soldiers, were, killed, during, engagement, with, israeli, forces, and, some, 5, 000, egyptian, soldiers, were, captured, by, the, israeli, army, amer, and, salah, salem, proposed, requesting, a, ceasefire, with, salem, further, recommending, that, nasser, surrender, himself, to, british, forces, nasser, berated, amer, and, salem, and, vowed, nobody, is, going, to, surrender, nasser, assumed, military, command, despite, the, relative, ease, in, which, sinai, was, occupied, nasser, s, prestige, at, home, and, among, arabs, was, undamaged, to, counterbalance, the, egyptian, army, s, dismal, performance, nasser, authorized, the, distribution, of, about, 400, 000, rifles, to, civilian, volunteers, and, hundreds, of, militias, were, formed, throughout, egypt, many, led, by, nasser, s, political, opponents, it, was, at, port, said, that, nasser, saw, a, confrontation, with, the, invading, forces, as, being, the, strategic, and, psychological, focal, point, of, egypt, s, defense, a, third, infantry, battalion, and, hundreds, of, national, guardsmen, were, sent, to, the, city, as, reinforcements, while, two, regular, companies, were, dispatched, to, organize, popular, resistance, nasser, and, boghdadi, traveled, to, the, canal, zone, to, boost, the, morale, of, the, armed, volunteers, according, to, boghdadi, s, memoirs, nasser, described, the, egyptian, army, as, shattered, as, he, saw, the, wreckage, of, egyptian, military, equipment, en, route, when, british, and, french, forces, landed, in, port, said, on, 5, 6, november, its, local, militia, put, up, a, stiff, resistance, resulting, in, street, to, street, fighting, the, egyptian, army, commander, in, the, city, was, preparing, to, request, terms, for, a, ceasefire, but, nasser, ordered, him, to, desist, the, british, french, forces, managed, to, largely, secure, the, city, by, 7, november, between, 750, and, 1, 000, egyptians, were, killed, in, the, battle, for, port, said, the, us, eisenhower, administration, condemned, the, tripartite, invasion, and, supported, un, resolutions, demanding, withdrawal, and, a, united, nations, emergency, force, unef, to, be, stationed, in, sinai, nasser, commended, eisenhower, stating, he, played, the, greatest, and, most, decisive, role, in, stopping, the, tripartite, conspiracy, by, the, end, of, december, british, and, french, forces, had, totally, withdrawn, from, egyptian, territory, while, israel, completed, its, withdrawal, in, march, 1957, and, released, all, egyptian, prisoners, of, war, as, a, result, of, the, suez, crisis, nasser, brought, in, a, set, of, regulations, imposing, rigorous, requirements, for, residency, and, citizenship, as, well, as, forced, expulsions, mostly, affecting, british, and, french, nationals, and, jews, with, foreign, nationality, as, well, as, many, egyptian, jews, some, 25, 000, jews, almost, half, of, the, jewish, community, left, in, 1956, mainly, for, israel, europe, the, united, states, and, south, america, after, the, fighting, ended, amer, accused, nasser, of, provoking, an, unnecessary, war, and, then, blaming, the, military, for, the, result, on, 8, april, the, canal, was, reopened, and, nasser, s, political, position, was, enormously, enhanced, by, the, widely, perceived, failure, of, the, invasion, and, attempt, to, topple, him, british, diplomat, anthony, nutting, claimed, the, crisis, established, nasser, finally, and, completely, as, the, rayyes, president, of, egypt, by, 1957, pan, arabism, had, become, the, dominant, ideology, in, the, arab, world, and, the, average, arab, citizen, considered, nasser, their, undisputed, leader, historian, adeed, dawisha, credited, nasser, s, status, to, his, charisma, bolstered, by, his, perceived, victory, in, the, suez, crisis, the, cairo, based, voice, of, the, arabs, radio, station, spread, nasser, s, ideas, of, united, arab, action, throughout, the, arabic, speaking, world, so, much, so, that, historian, eugene, rogan, wrote, nasser, conquered, the, arab, world, by, radio, lebanese, sympathizers, of, nasser, and, the, egyptian, embassy, in, beirut, the, press, center, of, the, arab, world, bought, out, lebanese, media, outlets, to, further, disseminate, nasser, s, ideals, egypt, also, expanded, its, policy, of, secondment, dispatching, thousands, of, high, skilled, egyptian, professionals, usually, politically, active, teachers, across, the, region, nasser, also, enjoyed, the, support, of, arab, nationalist, civilian, and, paramilitary, organizations, throughout, the, region, his, followers, were, numerous, and, well, funded, but, lacked, any, permanent, structure, and, organization, they, called, themselves, nasserites, despite, nasser, s, objection, to, the, label, he, preferred, the, term, arab, nationalists, in, january, 1957, the, us, adopted, the, eisenhower, doctrine, and, pledged, to, prevent, the, spread, of, communism, and, its, perceived, agents, in, the, middle, east, although, nasser, was, an, opponent, of, communism, in, the, region, his, promotion, of, pan, arabism, was, viewed, as, a, threat, by, pro, western, states, in, the, region, eisenhower, tried, to, isolate, nasser, and, reduce, his, regional, influence, by, attempting, to, transform, king, saud, into, a, counterweight, also, in, january, the, elected, jordanian, prime, minister, and, nasser, supporter, sulayman, al, nabulsi, brought, jordan, into, a, military, pact, with, egypt, syria, and, saudi, arabia, relations, between, nasser, and, king, hussein, of, jordan, deteriorated, in, april, when, hussein, implicated, nasser, in, two, coup, attempts, against, him, although, nasser, s, involvement, was, never, established, and, dissolved, al, nabulsi, s, cabinet, nasser, subsequently, slammed, hussein, on, cairo, radio, as, being, a, tool, of, the, imperialists, relations, with, king, saud, also, became, antagonistic, as, the, latter, began, to, fear, that, nasser, s, increasing, popularity, in, saudi, arabia, was, a, genuine, threat, to, the, royal, family, s, survival, despite, opposition, from, the, governments, of, jordan, saudi, arabia, iraq, and, lebanon, nasser, maintained, his, prestige, among, their, citizens, and, those, of, other, arab, countries, by, the, end, of, 1957, nasser, nationalized, all, remaining, british, and, french, assets, in, egypt, including, the, tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and, phosphate, industries, when, efforts, to, offer, tax, incentives, and, attract, outside, investments, yielded, no, tangible, results, he, nationalized, more, companies, and, made, them, a, part, of, his, economic, development, organization, he, stopped, short, of, total, government, control, two, thirds, of, the, economy, was, still, in, private, hands, this, effort, achieved, a, measure, of, success, with, increased, agricultural, production, and, investment, in, industrialization, nasser, initiated, the, helwan, steelworks, which, subsequently, became, egypt, s, largest, enterprise, providing, the, country, with, product, and, tens, of, thousands, of, jobs, nasser, also, decided, to, cooperate, with, the, soviet, union, in, the, construction, of, the, aswan, dam, to, replace, the, withdrawal, of, us, funds, despite, his, popularity, with, the, people, of, the, arab, world, by, mid, 1957, his, only, regional, ally,

government, nasser, sent, a, contingent, force, to, syria, as, a, symbolic, display, of, solidarity, further, elevating, his, prestige, in, the, arab, world, and, particularly, among, syrians, as, political, instability, grew, in, syria, delegations, from, the, country, were, sent, to, nasser, demanding, immediate, unification, with, egypt, nasser, initially, turned, down, the, request, citing, the, two, countries, incompatible, political, and, economic, systems, lack, of, contiguity, the, syrian, military, s, record, of, intervention, in, politics, and, the, deep, factionalism, among, syria, s, political, forces, however, in, january, 1958, a, second, syrian, delegation, managed, to, convince, nasser, of, an, impending, communist, takeover, and, a, consequent, slide, to, civil, strife, nasser, subsequently, opted, for, union, albeit, on, the, condition, that, it, would, be, a, total, political, merger, with, him, as, its, president, to, which, the, delegates, and, syrian, president, shukri, al, quwatli, agreed, on, 1, february, the, united, arab, republic, uar, was, proclaimed, and, according, to, dawisha, the, arab, world, reacted, in, stunned, amazement, which, quickly, turned, into, uncontrolled, euphoria, nasser, ordered, a, crackdown, against, syrian, communists, dismissing, many, of, them, from, their, governmental, posts, on, a, surprise, visit, to,

while, nasser, was, in, syria, king, saud, planned, to, have, him, assassinated, on, his, return, flight, to, cairo, on, 4, march, nasser, addressed, the, masses, in, damascus, and, waved, before, them, the, saudi, check, given, to, syrian, security, chief, and, unbeknownst, to, the, saudis, ardent, nasser, supporter, abdel, hamid, sarraj, to, shoot, down, nasser, s, plane, as, a, consequence, of, saud, s, plot, he, was, forced, by, senior, members, of, the, saudi, royal, family, to, informally, cede, most, of, his, powers, to, his, brother, king, faisal, a, major, nasser, opponent, who, advocated, pan, islamic, unity, over, pan, arabism, a, day, after, announcing, the, attempt, on, his, life, nasser, established, a, new, provisional, constitution, proclaiming, a, 600, member, national, assembly, 400, from, egypt, and, 200, from, syria, and, the, dissolution, of, all, political, parties, nasser, gave, each, of, the, provinces, two, vice, presidents, boghdadi, and, amer, in,

ban, on, the, communist, party, but, nasser, refused, stating, it, was, an, internal, matter, which, was, not, a, subject, of, discussion, with, outside, powers, khrushchev, was, reportedly, taken, aback, and, denied, he, had, meant, to, interfere, in, the, uar, s, affairs, the, matter, was, settled, as, both, leaders, sought, to, prevent, a, rift, between, their, two, countries, with, the, establishment, of, the, united, arab, republic, the, united, states, under, president, eisenhower, attempted, to, build, better, relations, and, initiate, a, rapprochement, between, the, two, countries, contrasting, with, the, previously, cautious, stance, of, the, american, government, towards, nasser, in, particular, nasser, sought, american, assistance, in, his, ideological, cold, war, with, abdel, karim, qasim, in, iraq, and, his, ideology, of, qasimism, which, conflicted, with, nasser, s, pan, arab, nationalism, however, due, to, major, ideological, differences, no, significant, long, term, working, relationship, developed, between, nasser, and, eisenhower, the, holy, march, on, which, the, arab, nation, insists, will, carry, us, forward, from, one, victory, to, another, the,

of, the, issue, to, sarraj, who, provided, limited, aid, to, nasser, s, lebanese, supporters, through, money, light, arms, and, officer, training, short, of, the, large, scale, support, that, chamoun, alleged, nasser, did, not, covet, lebanon, seeing, it, as, a, special, case, but, sought, to, prevent, chamoun, from, a, second, presidential, term, in, oman, the, jebel, akhdar, war, between, the, rebels, in, the, interior, of, oman, against, the, british, backed, sultanate, of, oman, prompted, nasser, to, support, the, rebels, in, what, was, considered, a, war, against, colonialism, between, 1954, and, 1959, on, 14, july, 1958, iraqi, army, officers, abdel, karim, qasim, and, abdel, salam, aref, overthrew, the, iraqi, monarchy, and, the, next, day, iraqi, prime, minister, and, nasser, s,

dragged, across, baghdad, nasser, recognized, the, new, government, and, stated, that, any, attack, on, iraq, was, tantamount, to, an, attack, on, the, uar, on, 15, july, us, marines, landed, in, lebanon, and, british, special, forces, in, jordan, upon, the, request, of, those, countries, governments, to, prevent, them, from, falling, to, pro, nasser, forces, nasser, felt, that, the, revolution, in, iraq, left, the, road, for, pan, arab, unity, unblocked, on, 19, july, for, the, first, time, he, declared, that, he, was, opting, for, full, arab, union, although, he, had, no, plan, to, merge, iraq, with, the, uar, while, most, members, of, the, iraqi, revolutionary, command, council, rcc, favored, iraqi, uar, unity, qasim, sought, to, keep, iraq, independent, and, resented, nasser, s, large, popular, base, in, the, country, in, the, fall, of, 1958, nasser, formed, a, tripartite, committee, consisting, of, zakaria, mohieddin, al, hawrani, and, salah, bitar, to, oversee, developments, in, syria, by, moving, the, latter, two, who, were, ba, athists, to, cairo, he, neutralized, important, political, figures, who, had, their, own, ideas, about, how, syria, should, be, run, he, put, syria, under, sarraj, who, effectively, reduced, the, province, to, a, police, state, by, imprisoning, and, exiling, landholders, who, objected, to, the, introduction, of, egyptian, agricultural, reform, in, syria, as, well, as, communists, following, the, lebanese, election, of, fuad, chehab, in, september, 1958, relations, between, lebanon, and, the, uar, improved, considerably, on, 25, march, 1959, chehab, and, nasser, met, at, the, lebanese, syrian, border, and, compromised, on, an, end, to, the, lebanese, crisis, relations, between, nasser, and, qasim, grew, increasingly, bitter, on, 9, march, after, qasim, s, forces, suppressed, a, rebellion, in, mosul, launched, a, day, earlier, by, a, pro, nasser, iraqi, rcc, officer, backed, by, uar, authorities, nasser, had, considered, dispatching, troops, to, aid, his, iraqi, sympathizers, but, decided, against, it, he, clamped, down, on, egyptian, communist, activity, due, to, the, key, backing, iraqi, communists, provided, qasim, several, influential, communists, were, arrested, including, nasser, s, old, comrade, khaled, mohieddin, who, had, been, allowed, to, re, enter, egypt, in, 1956, by, december, the, political, situation, in, syria, was, faltering, and, nasser, responded, by, appointing, amer, as, governor, general, alongside, sarraj, syria, s, leaders, opposed, the, appointment, and, many, resigned, from, their, government, posts, nasser, later, met, with, the, opposition, leaders, and, in, a, heated, moment, exclaimed, that, he, was, the, elected, president, of, the, uar, and, those, who, did, not, accept, his, authority, could, walk, away, opposition, to, the, union, mounted, among, some, of, syria, s, key, elements, namely, the, socioeconomic, political, and, military, elites, in, response, to, syria, s, worsening, economy, which, nasser, attributed, to, its, control, by, the, bourgeoisie, in, july, 1961, nasser, decreed, socialist, measures, that, nationalized, wide, ranging, sectors, of, the, syrian, economy, he, also, dismissed, sarraj, in, september, to, curb, the, growing, political, crisis, aburish, states, that, nasser, was, not, fully, capable, of, addressing, syrian, problems, because, they, were, foreign, to, him, in, egypt, the, economic, situation, was, more, positive, with, a, gnp, growth, of, 4, 5, percent, and, a, rapid, growth, of, industry, in, 1960, nasser, nationalized, the, egyptian, press, which, had, already, been, cooperating, with, his, government, in, order, to, steer, coverage, towards, the, country, s, socioeconomic, issues, and, galvanize, public, support, for, his, socialist, measures, on, 28, september, 1961, secessionist, army, units, launched, a, coup, in, damascus, declaring, syria, s, secession, from, the, uar, in, response, pro, union, army, units, in, northern, syria, revolted, and, pro, nasser, protests, occurred, in, major, syrian, cities, nasser, sent, egyptian, special, forces, to, latakia, to, bolster, his, allies, but, withdrew, them, two, days, later, citing, a, refusal, to, allow, inter, arab, fighting, addressing, the, uar, s, breakup, on, 5, october, nasser, accepted, personal, responsibility, and, declared, that, egypt, would, recognize, an, elected, syrian, government, he, privately, blamed, interference, by, hostile, arab, governments, according, to, heikal, nasser, suffered, something, resembling, a, nervous, breakdown, after, the, dissolution, of, the, union, he, began, to, smoke, more, heavily, and, his, health, began, to, deteriorate, nasser, s, regional, position, changed, unexpectedly, when, yemeni, officers, led, by, nasser, supporter, abdullah, al, sallal, overthrew, imam, badr, of, north, yemen, on, 27, september, 1962, al, badr, and, his, tribal, partisans, began, receiving, increasing, support, from, saudi, arabia, to, help, reinstate, the, kingdom, while, nasser, subsequently, accepted, a, request, by, sallal, to, militarily, aid, the, new, government, on, 30, september, consequently, egypt, became, increasingly, embroiled, in, the, drawn, out, civil, war, with, 60, 000, egyptian, soldiers, deployed, in, north, yemen, in, march, 1966, in, august, 1967, in, order, to, make, up, for, egyptian, losses, during, the, six, day, war, nasser, recalled, 15, 000, troops, from, north, yemen, as, part, of, the, khartoum, resolution, at, the, 1967, arab, league, summit, in, the, same, month, egypt, announced, that, it, was, ready, to, withdraw, all, its, soldiers, from, north, yemen, and, it, did, so, by, the, end, of, 1967, 26, 000, egyptian, soldiers, were, killed, during, the, intervention, most, of, nasser, s, old, colleagues, had, questioned, the, wisdom, of, continuing, the, war, but, amer, reassured, nasser, of, their, coming, victory, nasser, later, remarked, in, 1968, that, intervention, in, yemen, was, a, miscalculation, in, july, 1962, algeria, became, independent, of, france, as, a, staunch, political, and, financial, supporter, of, the, algerian, independence, movement, nasser, considered, the, country, s, independence, to, be, a, personal, victory, amid, these, developments, a, pro, nasser, clique, in, the, saudi, royal, family, led, by, prince, talal, defected, to, egypt, along, with, the, jordanian, chief, of, staff, in, early, 1963, on, 8, february, 1963, a, military, coup, in, iraq, led, by, a, ba, athist, nasserist, alliance, toppled, qasim, who, was, subsequently, shot, dead, abdel, salam, aref, a, nasserist, was, chosen, to, be, the, new, president, a, similar, alliance, toppled, the, syrian, government, on, 8, march, on, 14, march, the, new, iraqi, and, syrian, governments, sent, nasser, delegations, to, push, for, a, new, arab, union, at, the, meeting, nasser, lambasted, the, ba, athists, for, facilitating, syria, s, split, from, the, uar, and, asserted, that, he, was, the, leader, of, the, arabs, a, transitional, unity, agreement, stipulating, a, federal, system, was, signed, by, the, parties, on, 17, april, and, the, new, union, was, set, to, be, established, in, may, 1965, however, the, agreement, fell, apart, weeks, later, when, syria, s, ba, athists, purged, nasser, s, supporters, from, the, officers, corps, a, failed, counter, coup, by, a, nasserist, colonel, followed, after, which, nasser, condemned, the, ba, athists, as, fascists, in, january, 1964, nasser, called, for, an, arab, league, summit, in, cairo, to, establish, a, unified, arab, response, against, israel, s, plans, to, divert, the, jordan, river, s, waters, for, economic, purposes, which, syria, and, jordan, deemed, an, act, of, war, nasser, blamed, arab, divisions, for, what, he, deemed, the, disastrous, situation, he, discouraged, syria, and, palestinian, guerrillas, from, provoking, the, israelis, conceding, that, he, had, no, plans, for, war, with, israel, during, the, summit, nasser, developed, cordial, relations, with, king, hussein, and, ties, were, mended, with, the, rulers, of, saudi, arabia, syria, and, morocco, in, may, nasser, moved, to, formally, share, his, leadership, position, over, the, palestine, issue, by, initiating, the, creation, of, the, palestine, liberation, organization, plo, in, practice, nasser, used, the, plo, to, wield, control, over, the, palestinian, fedayeen, its, head, was, to, be, ahmad, shukeiri, nasser, s, personal, nominee, after, years, of, foreign, policy, coordination, and, developing, ties, nasser, president, sukarno, of, indonesia, president, tito, of, yugoslavia, and, prime, minister, nehru, of, india, founded, the, non, aligned, movement, nam, in, 1961, its, declared, purpose, was, to, solidify, international, non, alignment, and, promote, world, peace, amid, the, cold, war, end, colonization, and, increase, economic, cooperation, among, developing, countries, in, 1964, nasser, was, made, president, of, the, nam, and, held, the, second, conference, of, the, organization, in, cairo, nasser, played, a, significant, part, in, the, strengthening, of, african, solidarity, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, although, his, continental, leadership, role, had, increasingly, passed, to, algeria, since, 1962, during, this, period, nasser, made, egypt, a, refuge, for, anti, colonial, leaders, from, several, african, countries, and, allowed, the, broadcast, of, anti, colonial, propaganda, from, cairo, beginning, in, 1958, nasser, had, a, key, role, in, the, discussions, among, african, leaders, that, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, organisation, of, african, unity, oau, in, 1963, in, 1961, nasser, sought, to, firmly, establish, egypt, as, the, leader, of, the, arab, world, and, to, promote, a, second, revolution, in, egypt, with, the, purpose, of, merging, islamic, and, socialist, thinking, to, achieve, this, he, initiated, several, reforms, to, modernize, al, azhar, which, serves, as, the, de, facto, leading, authority, in, sunni, islam, and, to, ensure, its, prominence, over, the, muslim, brotherhood, and, the, more, conservative, wahhabism, promoted, by, saudi, arabia, nasser, had, used, al, azhar, s, most, willing, ulema, scholars, as, a, counterweight, to, the, brotherhood, s, islamic, influence, starting, in, 1953, nasser, instructed, al, azhar, to, create, changes, in, its, syllabus, that, trickled, to, the, lower, levels, of, egyptian, education, consequently, allowing, the, establishment, of, coeducational, schools, and, the, introduction, of, evolution, into, school, curriculum, the, reforms, also, included, the, merger, of, religious, and, civil, courts, moreover, nasser, forced, al, azhar, to, issue, a, fatw, admitting, shia, muslims, alawites, and, druze, into, mainstream, islam, for, centuries, prior, al, azhar, deemed, them, to, be, heretics, following, syria, s, secession, nasser, grew, concerned, with, amer, s, inability, to, train, and, modernize, the, army, and, with, the, state, within, a, state, amer, had, created, in, the, military, command, and, intelligence, apparatus, in, late, 1961, nasser, established, the, presidential, council, and, decreed, it, the, authority, to, approve, all, senior, military, appointments, instead, of, leaving, this, responsibility, solely, to, amer, moreover, he, instructed, that, the, primary, criterion, for, promotion, should, be, merit, and, not, personal, loyalties, nasser, retracted, the, initiative, after, amer, s, allies, in, the, officers, corps, threatened, to, mobilize, against, him, in, early, 1962, nasser, again, attempted, to, wrest, control, of, the, military, command, from, amer, amer, responded, by, directly, confronting, nasser, for, the, first, time, and, secretly, rallying, his, loyalist, officers, nasser, ultimately, backed, down, wary, of, a, possible, violent, confrontation, between, the, military, and, his, civilian, government, according, to, boghdadi, the, stress, caused, by, the, uar, s, collapse, and, amer, s, increasing, autonomy, forced, nasser, who, already, had, diabetes, to, practically, live, on, painkillers, from, then, on, in, october, 1961, nasser, embarked, on, a, major, nationalization, program, for, egypt, believing, the, total, adoption, of, socialism, was, the, answer, to, his, country, s, problems, and, would, have, prevented, syria, s, secession, in, order, to, organize, and, solidify, his, popular, base, with, egypt, s, citizens, and, counter, the, army, s, influence, nasser, introduced, the, national, charter, in, 1962, and, a, new, constitution, the, charter, called, for, universal, health, care, affordable, housing, vocational, schools, greater, women, s, rights, and, a, family, planning, program, as, well, as, widening, the, suez, canal, nasser, also, attempted, to, maintain, oversight, of, the, country, s, civil, service, to, prevent, it, from, inflating, and, consequently, becoming, a, burden, to, the, state, new, laws, provided, workers, with, a, minimum, wage, profit, shares, free, education, free, health, care, reduced, working, hours, and, encouragement, to, participate, in, management, land, reforms, guaranteed, the, security, of, tenant, farmers, promoted, agricultural, growth, and, reduced, rural, poverty, as, a, result, of, the, 1962, measures, government, ownership, of, egyptian, business, reached, 51, percent, and, the, national, union, was, renamed, the, arab, socialist, union, asu, with, these, measures, came, more, domestic, repression, as, thousands, of, islamists, were, imprisoned, including, dozens, of, military, officers, nasser, s, tilt, toward, a, soviet, style, system, led, his, aides, boghdadi, and, hussein, el, shafei, to, submit, their, resignations, in, protest, during, the, presidential, referendum, in, egypt, nasser, was, re, elected, to, a, second, term, as, uar, president, and, took, his, oath, on, 25, march, 1965, he, was, the, only, candidate, for, the, position, with, virtually, all, of, his, political, opponents, forbidden, by, law, from, running, for, office, and, his, fellow, party, members, reduced, to, mere, followers, that, same, year, nasser, had, the, muslim, brotherhood, chief, ideologue, sayyed, qutb, imprisoned, qutb, was, charged, and, found, guilty, by, the, court, of, plotting, to, assassinate, nasser, and, was, executed, in, 1966, beginning, in, 1966, as, egypt, s, economy, slowed, and, government, debt, became, increasingly, burdensome, nasser, began, to, ease, state, control, over, the, private, sector, encouraging, state, owned, bank, loans, to, private, business, and, introducing, incentives, to, increase, exports, during, the, 60s, the, egyptian, economy, went, from, sluggishness, to, the, verge, of, collapse, the, society, became, less, free, and, nasser, s, appeal, waned, considerably, in, mid, may, 1967, the, soviet, union, issued, warnings, to, nasser, of, an, impending, israeli, attack, on, syria, although, chief, of, staff, mohamed, fawzi, considered, the, warnings, to, be, baseless, according, to, kandil, without, nasser, s, authorization, amer, used, the, soviet, warnings, as, a, pretext, to, dispatch, troops, to, sinai, on, 14, may, and, nasser, subsequently, demanded, unef, s, withdrawal, earlier, that, day, nasser, received, a, warning, from, king, hussein, of, israeli, american, collusion, to, drag, egypt, into, war, the, message, had, been, originally, received, by, amer, on, 2, may, but, was, withheld, from, nasser, until, the, sinai, deployment, on, 14, may, although, in, the, preceding, months, hussein, and, nasser, had, been, accusing, each, other, of, avoiding, a, fight, with, israel, hussein, was, nonetheless, wary, that, an, egyptian, israeli, war, would, risk, the, west, bank, s, occupation, by, israel, nasser, still, felt, that, the, us, would, restrain, israel, from, attacking, due, to, assurances, that, he, received, from, the, us, and, soviet, union, in, turn, he, also, reassured, both, powers, that, egypt, would, only, act, defensively, on, 21, may, amer, asked, nasser, to, order, the, straits, of, tiran, blockaded, a, move, nasser, believed, israel, would, use, as, a, casus, belli, amer, reassured, him, that, the, army, was, prepared, for, confrontation, but, nasser, doubted, amer, s, assessment, of, the, military, s, readiness, according, to, nasser, s, vice, president, zakaria, mohieddin, although, amer, had, absolute, authority, over, the, armed, forces, nasser, had, his, ways, of, knowing, what, was, really, going, on, moreover, amer, anticipated, an, impending, israeli, attack, and, advocated, a, preemptive, strike, nasser, refused, the, call, upon, determination, that, the, air, force, lacked, pilots, and, amer, s, handpicked, officers, were, incompetent, still, nasser, concluded, that, if, israel, attacked, egypt, s, quantitative, advantage, in, manpower, and, arms, could, stave, off, israeli, forces, for, at, least, two, weeks, allowing, for, diplomacy, towards, a, ceasefire, israel, repeated, declarations, it, had, made, in, 1957, that, any, closure, of, the, straits, would, be, considered, an, act, of, war, or, justification, for, war, but, nasser, closed, the, straits, to, israeli, shipping, on, 22, 23, may, towards, the, end, of, may, nasser, increasingly, exchanged, his, positions, of, deterrence, for, deference, to, the, inevitability, of, war, under, increased, pressure, to, act, by, both, the, general, arab, populace, and, various, arab, governments, on, 26, may, nasser, declared, our, basic, objective, will, be, to, destroy, israel, on, 30, may, king, hussein, committed, jordan, in, an, alliance, with, egypt, and, syria, on, the, morning, of, 5, june, the, israeli, air, force, struck, egyptian, air, fields, destroying, much, of, the, egyptian, air, force, before, the, day, ended, israeli, armored, units, had, cut, through, egyptian, defense, lines, and, captured, the, town, of, el, arish, the, next, day, amer, ordered, the, immediate, withdrawal, of, egyptian, troops, from, sinai, causing, the, majority, of, egyptian, casualties, during, the, war, israel, quickly, captured, sinai, and, the, gaza, strip, from, egypt, the, west, bank, from, jordan, and, the, golan, heights, from, syria, according, to, sadat, it, was, only, when, the, israelis, cut, off, the, egyptian, garrison, at, sharm, el, sheikh, that, nasser, became, aware, of, the, situation, s, gravity, after, hearing, of, the, attack, he, rushed, to, army, headquarters, to, inquire, about, the, military, situation, the, simmering, conflict, between, nasser, and, amer, subsequently, came, to, the, fore, and, officers, present, reported, the, pair, burst, into, a, nonstop, shouting, match, the, supreme, executive, committee, set, up, by, nasser, to, oversee, the, conduct, of, the, war, attributed, the, repeated, egyptian, defeats, to, the, nasser, amer, rivalry, and, amer, s, overall, incompetence, according, to, egyptian,

acquired, in, the, war, his, supporters, claimed, nasser, s, move, was, meant, to, buy, time, to, prepare, for, another, confrontation, with, israel, while, his, detractors, believed, his, acceptance,

promises, would, largely, go, unfulfilled, nasser, appointed, sadat, and, hussein, el, shafei, as, his, vice, presidents, in, december, 1969, by, then, relations, with, his, other, original, military, comrades, namely, khaled, and, zakaria, mohieddin, and, former, vice, president, sabri, had, become, strained, by, mid, 1970, nasser, pondered, replacing, sadat, with, boghdadi, after, reconciling, with, the, latter, meanwhile, in, january, 1968, nasser, commenced, the, war, of, attrition, to, reclaim, territory, captured, by, israel, ordering, attacks, against, israeli, positions, east, of, the, then, blockaded, suez, canal, in, march, nasser, offered, yasser, arafat, s, fatah, movement, arms, and, funds, after, their, performance, against, israeli, forces, in, the, battle, of, karameh, that, month, he, also, advised, arafat, to, think, of, peace, with, israel, and, the, establishment, of, a, palestinian, state, comprising, the, west, bank, and, the, gaza, strip, nasser, effectively, ceded, his, leadership, of, the, palestine, issue, to, arafat, israel, retaliated, against, egyptian, shelling, with, commando, raids, artillery, shelling, and, air, strikes, this, resulted, in, an,

called, for, an, end, to, hostilities, and, an, israeli, withdrawal, from, egyptian, territory, but, it, was, rejected, by, israel, the, plo, and, most, arab, states, except, jordan, nasser, had, initially, rejected, the, plan, but, conceded, under, pressure, from, the, soviet, union, which, feared, that, escalating, regional, conflict, could, drag, it, into, a, war, with, the, us, he, also, determined, that, a, ceasefire, could, serve, as, a, tactical, step, toward, the, strategic, goal, of, recapturing, the, suez, canal, nasser, forestalled, any, movement, toward, direct, negotiations, with, israel, in, dozens, of, speeches, and, statements, nasser, posited, the, equation, that, any, direct, peace, talks, with, israel, were, tantamount, to, surrender, following, nasser, s, acceptance, israel, agreed, to, a, ceasefire, and, nasser, used, the, lull, in, fighting, to, move, surface, to, air, missiles, towards, the, canal, zone, meanwhile, tensions, in, jordan, between, an, increasingly, autonomous, plo, and, king, hussein, s, government, had, been, simmering, following, the, dawson, s, field, hijackings, a, military, campaign, was, launched, to, rout, out, plo, forces, the, offensive, elevated, risks, of, a, regional, war, and, prompted, nasser, to, hold, an, emergency, arab, league, summit, on, 27, september, in, cairo, where, he, forged, a, ceasefire, as, the, arab, league, summit, closed, on, 28, september, 1970, hours, after, escorting, the, last, arab, leader, to, leave, nasser, suffered, a, heart, attack, he, was, immediately, transported, to, his,

with, a, family, history, of, heart, disease, two, of, his, brothers, died, in, their, fifties, from, the, same, condition, the, state, of, nasser, s, health, was, not, known, to, the, public, prior,

crowds, and, as, a, result, most, of, the, foreign, dignitaries, were, evacuated, the, final, destination, was, the, nasr, mosque, which, was, afterwards, renamed, abdel, nasser, mosque, where, nasser, was, buried, because, of, his, ability, to, motivate, nationalistic, passions, men, women, and, children, wept, and, wailed, in, the, streets, after, hearing, of, his, death, according, to, nutting, the, general, arab, reaction, was, one, of, mourning, with, thousands, of, people, pouring, onto, the, streets, of, major, cities, throughout, the, arab, world, over, a, dozen, people, were,

unchallenged, leadership, of, the, arab, people, following, his, death, the, headline, of, the, lebanese, le, jour, read, one, hundred, million, human, beings, the, arabs, are, orphans, sherif, hetata, a, former, political, prisoner, and, later, member, nasser, s, asu, said, that, nasser, s, greatest, achievement, was, his, funeral, the, world, will, never, again, see, five, million, people, crying, together, nasser, made, egypt, fully, independent, of, british, influence, and, the, country, became, a, major, power, in, the, developing, world, under, his, leadership, one, of, nasser, s, main, domestic, efforts, was, to, establish, social, justice, which, he, deemed, a, prerequisite, to, liberal, democracy, during, his, presidency, ordinary, citizens, enjoyed, unprecedented, access, to, housing, education, jobs, health, services, and, nourishment, as, well, as, other, forms, of, social, welfare, while, feudalistic, influence, waned, however, these, advances, came, at, the, expense, of, civil, liberties, in, nasser, s, egypt, the, media, were, tightly, controlled, mail, was, opened, and, telephones, were, wiretapped, he, was, elected, in, 1956, 1958, and, 1965, in, plebiscites, in, which, he, was, the, sole, candidate, each, time, claiming, unanimous, or, near, unanimous, support, with, few, exceptions, the, legislature, did, little, more, than, approve, nasser, s, policies, as, the, legislature, was, made, up, almost, entirely, of, government, supporters, nasser, effectively, held, all, governing, power, in, the, nation, by, the, end, of, his, presidency, employment, and, working, conditions, improved, considerably, although, poverty, was, still, high, in, the, country, and, substantial, resources, allocated, for, social, welfare, had, been, diverted, to, the, war, effort, the, national, economy, grew, significantly, through, agrarian, reform, major, modernization, projects, such, as, the, helwan, steel, works, and, the, aswan, dam, and, nationalization, schemes, such, as, that, of, the, suez, canal, however, the, marked, economic, growth, of, the, early, 1960s, took, a, downturn, for, the, remainder, of, the, decade, only, recovering, in, 1970, egypt, experienced, a, golden, age, of, culture, during, nasser, s, presidency, according, to, historian, joel, gordon, particularly, in, film, television, theater, radio, literature, fine, arts, comedy, poetry, and, music, egypt, under, nasser, dominated, the, arab, world, in, these, fields, producing, cultural, icons, during, mubarak, s, presidency, nasserist, political, parties, began, to, emerge, in, egypt, the, first, being, the, arab, democratic, nasserist, party, adnp, the, party, carried, minor, political, influence, and, splits, between, its, members, beginning, in, 1995, resulted, in, the, gradual, establishment, of, splinter, parties, including, hamdeen, sabahi, s, 1997, founding, of, al, karama, sabahi, came, in, third, place, during, the, 2012, presidential, election, nasserist, activists, were, among, the, founders, of, kefaya, a, major, opposition, force, during, mubarak, s, rule, on, 19, september, 2012, four, nasserist, parties, the, adnp, karama, the, national, conciliation, party, and, the, popular, nasserist, congress, party, merged, to, form, the, united, nasserist, party, nasser, was, known, for, his, accessibility, and, direct, relationship, with, ordinary, egyptians, his, availability, to, the, public, despite, assassination, attempts, against, him, was, unparalleled, among, his, successors, a, skilled, orator, nasser, gave, 1, 359, speeches, between, 1953, and, 1970, a, record, for, any, egyptian, head, of, state, historian, elie, podeh, wrote, that, a, constant, theme, of, nasser, s, image, was, his, ability, to, represent, egyptian, authenticity, in, triumph, or, defeat, the, national, press, also, helped, to, foster, his, popularity, and, profile, more, so, after, the, nationalization, of, state, media, historian, tarek, osman, wrote, the, interplay, in, the, nasser, phenomenon, between, genuine, expression, of, popular, feeling, and, state, sponsored, propaganda, may, sometimes, be, hard, to, disentangle, but, behind, it, lies, a, vital, historical, fact, that, gamal, abdel, nasser, signifies, the, only, truly, egyptian, developmental, project, in, the, country, s, history, since, the, fall, of, the, pharaonic, state, there, had, been, other, projects, but, this, was, different, in, origin, meaning, and, impact, for, nasser, was, a, man, of, the, egyptian, soil, who, had, overthrown, the, middle, east, s, most, established, and, sophisticated, monarchy, in, a, swift, and, bloodless, move, to, the, acclaim, of, millions, of, poor, oppressed, egyptians, and, ushered, in, a, programme, of, social, justice, progress, and, development, and, dignity, while, nasser, was, increasingly, criticized, by, egyptian, intellectuals, following, the, six, day, war, and, his, death, in, 1970, the, general, public, was, persistently, sympathetic, both, during, and, after, nasser, s, life, according, to, political, scientist, mahmoud, hamad, writing, in, 2008, nostalgia, for, nasser, is, easily, sensed, in, egypt, and, all, arab, countries, today, general, malaise, in, egyptian, society, particularly, during, the, mubarak, era, augmented, nostalgia, for, nasser, s, presidency, which, increasingly, became, associated, with, the, ideals, of, national, purpose, hope, social, cohesion, and, vibrant, culture, until, the, present, day, nasser, serves, as, an, iconic, figure, throughout, the, arab, world, a, symbol, of, arab, unity, and, dignity, and, a, towering, figure, in, modern, middle, eastern, history, he, is, also, considered, a, champion, of, social, justice, in, egypt, time, writes, that, despite, his, mistakes, and, shortcomings, nasser, imparted, a, sense, of, personal, worth, and, national, pride, that, had, not, known, for, 400, years, this, alone, may, have, been, enough, to, balance, his, flaws, and, failures, historian, steven, a, cook, wrote, in, july, 2013, nasser, s, heyday, still, represents, for, many, the, last, time, that, egypt, felt, united, under, leaders, whose, espoused, principles, met, the, needs, of, ordinary, egyptians, during, the, arab, spring, which, resulted, in, a, revolution, in, egypt, photographs, of, nasser, were, raised, in, cairo, and, arab, capitals, during, anti, government, demonstrations, according, to, journalist, lamis, andoni, nasser, had, become, a, symbol, of, arab, dignity, during, the, mass, demonstrations, sadat, declared, his, intention, to, continue, the, path, of, nasser, in, his, 7, october, 1970, presidential, inauguration, speech, but, began, to, depart, from, nasserist, policies, as, his, domestic, position, improved, following, the, 1973, october, war, president, sadat, s, infitah, policy, sought, to, open, egypt, s, economy, for, private, investment, according, to, heikal, ensuing, anti, nasser, developments, until, the, present, day, led, to, an, egypt, at, war, with, abdel, nasser, half, with, anwar, el, sadat, nasser, s, egyptian, detractors, considered, him, a, dictator, who, thwarted, democratic, progress, imprisoned, thousands, of, dissidents, and, led, a, repressive, administration, responsible, for, numerous, human, rights, violations, islamists, in, egypt, particularly, members, of, the, politically, persecuted, brotherhood, viewed, nasser, as, oppressive, tyrannical, and, demonic, samer, s, shehata, who, wrote, an, article, on, the, politics, of, laughter, nasser, sadat, and, mubarek, in, egyptian, political, jokes, noted, that, with, the, new, regime, came, the, end, of, parliamentary, politics, and, political, freedoms, including, the, right, to, organize, political, parties, and, freedoms, of, speech, and, the, press, liberal, writer, tawfiq, al, hakim, described, nasser, as, a, confused, sultan, who, employed, stirring, rhetoric, but, had, no, actual, plan, to, achieve, his, stated, goals, some, of, nasser, s, liberal, and, islamist, critics, in, egypt, including, the, founding, members, of, the, new, wafd, party, and, writer, jamal, badawi, dismissed, nasser, s, popular, appeal, with, the, egyptian, masses, during, his, presidency, as, being, the, product, of, successful, manipulation, and, demagoguery, egyptian, political, scientist, alaa, al, din, desouki, blamed, the, 1952, revolution, s, shortcomings, on, nasser, s, concentration, of, power, and, egypt, s, lack, of, democracy, on, nasser, s, political, style, and, his, government, s, limitations, on, freedom, of, expression, and, political, participation, american, political, scientist, mark, cooper, asserted, that, nasser, s, charisma, and, his, direct, relationship, with, the, egyptian, people, rendered, intermediaries, organizations, and, individuals, unnecessary, he, opined, that, nasser, s, legacy, was, a, guarantee, of, instability, due, to, nasser, s, reliance, on, personal, power, and, the, absence, of, strong, political, institutions, under, his, rule, historian, abd, al, azim, ramadan, wrote, that, nasser, was, an, irrational, and, irresponsible, leader, blaming, his, inclination, to, solitary, decision, making, for, egypt, s, losses, during, the, suez, war, among, other, events, miles, copeland, jr, a, central, intelligence, agency, officer, known, for, his, close, personal, relationship, with, nasser, said, that, the, barriers, between, nasser, and, the, outside, world, have, grown, so, thick, that, all, but, the, information, that, attest, to, his, infallibility, indispensability, and, immortality, has, been, filtered, out, zakaria, mohieddin, who, was, nasser, s, vice, president, said, that, nasser, gradually, changed, during, his, reign, he, ceased, consulting, his, colleagues, and, made, more, and, more, of, the, decisions, himself, although, nasser, repeatedly, said, that, a, war, with, israel, will, start, at, a, time, of, his, or, arab, choosing, in, 1967, he, started, a, bluffing, game, but, a, successful, bluff, means, your, opponent, must, not, know, which, cards, you, are, holding, in, this, case, nasser, s, opponent, could, see, his, hand, in, the, mirror, and, knew, he, was, only, holding, a, pair, of, deuces, and, nasser, knew, that, his, army, is, not, prepared, yet, all, of, this, was, out, of, character, his, tendencies, in, this, regard, may, have, been, accentuated, by, diabetes, that, was, the, only, rational, explanation, for, his, actions, in, 1967, nasser, told, a, german, neo, nazi, newspaper, in, 1964, that, no, person, not, even, the, most, simple, one, takes, seriously, the, lie, of, the, six, million, jews, that, were, murdered, however, he, is, not, known, to, have, ever, again, publicly, called, the, figure, of, six, million, into, question, perhaps, because, his, advisors, and, east, german, contacts, had, advised, him, on, the, subject, nasser, convinced, of, its, authenticity, also, encouraged, the, distribution, of, the, antisemitic, fabrication, the, protocols, of, the, elders, of, zion, he, believed, that, the, jews, greatly, influenced, the, global, financial, market, and, that, they, ultimately, strove, for, world, domination, nasser, also, hired, former, nazi, officials, like, johann, von, leers, to, distribute, antisemitic, propaganda, he, is, however, thought, to, have, been, more, moderate, in, that, regard, than, contemporary, political, powers, like, young, egypt, or, the, muslim, brotherhood, through, his, actions, and, speeches, and, because, he, was, able, to, symbolize, the, popular, arab, will, nasser, inspired, several, nationalist, revolutions, in, the, arab, world, he, defined, the, politics, of, his, generation, and, communicated, directly, with, the, public, masses, of, the, arab, world, bypassing, the, various, heads, of, states, of, those, countries, an, accomplishment, not, repeated, by, other, arab, leaders, the, extent, of, nasser, s, centrality, in, the, region, made, it, a, priority, for, incoming, arab, nationalist, heads, of, state, to, seek, good, relations, with, egypt, in, order, to, gain, popular, legitimacy, from, their, own, citizens, to, varying, degrees, nasser, s, statist, system, of, government, was, continued, in, egypt, and, emulated, by, virtually, all, arab, republics, namely, algeria, syria, iraq, tunisia, yemen, sudan, and, libya, ahmed, ben, bella, algeria, s, first, president, was, a, staunch, nasserist, abdullah, al, sallal, drove, out, the, king, of, north, yemen, in, the, name, of, nasser, s, pan, arabism, other, coups, influenced, by, nasser, included, those, that, occurred, in, iraq, in, july, 1958, and, syria, in, 1963, muammar, gaddafi, who, overthrew, the, libyan, monarchy, in, 1969, considered, nasser, his, hero, and, sought, to, succeed, him, as, leader, of, the, arabs, also, in, 1969, colonel, gaafar, nimeiry, a, supporter, of, nasser, took, power, in, sudan, the, arab, nationalist, movement, anm, helped, spread, nasser, s, pan, arabist, ideas, throughout, the, arab, world, particularly, among, the, palestinians, syrians, and, lebanese, and, in, south, yemen, the, persian, gulf, and, iraq, while, many, regional, heads, of, state, tried, to, emulate, nasser, podeh, opined, that, the, parochialism, of, successive, arab, leaders, transformed, imitation, into, parody, in, 1963, egyptian, director, youssef, chahine, produced, the, film, el, nasser, salah, el, dine, saladin, the, victorious, which, intentionally, drew, parallels, between, saladin, considered, a, hero, in, the, arab, world, and, nasser, and, his, pan, arabist,
