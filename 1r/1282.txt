quickly, gained, a, reputation, as, an, excellent, barrister, he, became, involved, in, british, politics, in, 1742, beginning, with, his, election, to, the, house, of, commons, as, a, member, of, parliament, for, boroughbridge, and, appointment, as, solicitor, general, in, the, absence, of, a, strong, attorney, general, mansfield, became, the, main, spokesman, for, the, government, in, the, house, of, commons, where, he, was, noted, for, his, great, powers, of, eloquence, and, was, described, as, beyond, comparison, the, best, speaker, with, the, promotion, of, sir, dudley, ryder, to, lord, chief, justice, in, 1754, mansfield, became, attorney, general, and, when, ryder, unexpectedly, died, several, months, later, he, took, his, place, as, chief, justice, as, the, most, powerful, british, jurist, of, the, 18th, century, mansfield, s, decisions, reflected, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, moved, the, country, onto, the, path, to, abolishing, slavery, he, advanced, commercial, law, in, ways, that, helped, establish, britain, as, world, leader, in, industry, finance, and, trade, modernised, both, english, law, and, england, s, courts, rationalised, the, system, for, submitting, motions, and, reformed, the, way, judgments, were, delivered, to, reduce, expense, for, the, parties, for, his, work, in, carter, v, boehm, and, pillans, v, van, mierop, mansfield, has, been, called, the, founder, of, english, commercial, law, mansfield, is, also, known, for, his, judgment, in, somerset, v, stewart, where, he, held, that, slavery, had, no, basis, in, common, law, and, had, never, been, established, by, positive, law, in, england, and, therefore, was, not, binding, in, law, though, the, judgement, did, not, explicitly, outlaw, slavery, in, either, britain, or, british, colonies, it, played, an, important, role, in, the, early, stages, of, the, british, abolitionist, movement, and, inspired, challenges, to, slavery, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, murray, was, born, on, 2, march, 1705, at, scone, palace, in, perthshire, scotland, the, fourth, son, of, the, 5th, viscount, of, stormont, and, his, wife, margaret, as, one, of, eleven, children, both, his, parents, were, strong, supporters, of, the, jacobite, cause, and, his, older, brother, james, followed, the, old, pretender, into, exile, this, left, the, family, s, finance, relatively, impoverished, the, jacobite, sympathies, of, murray, s, family, were, glossed, over, by, contemporaries, who, claimed, that, he, had, been, educated, at, lichfield, grammar, school, with, many, other, members, of, the, english, judiciary, this, was, incorrect, as, murray, was, educated, at, perth, grammar, school, where, he, was, taught, latin, english, grammar, and, essay, writing, skills, he, later, said, that, this, gave, him, a, great, advantage, at, university, as, those, students, educated, in, england, had, been, taught, greek, and, latin, but, not, how, to, write, properly, in, english, while, at, perth, grammar, school, it, became, apparent, that, murray, was, particularly, intelligent, in, 1718, his, father, and, older, brother, james, decided, to, send, him, to, westminster, school, as, james, knew, the, dean, francis, atterbury, thirteen, year, old, murray, travelled, alone, with, a, pony, given, by, his, father, the, distance, from, perth, to, london, was, around, 400, miles, 640, km, and, the, journey, took, murray, 54, days, murray, flourished, at, westminster, and, was, made, a, king, s, scholar, on, 21, may, 1719, after, an, examination, in, may, 1723, murray, was, accepted, into, christ, church, oxford, having, scored, higher, in, the, examination, than, any, other, king, s, scholar, that, year, he, was, admitted, as, a, commoner, on, 15, june, 1723, and, matriculated, on, 18, june, the, records, say, that, he, came, from, bath, rather, than, perth, as, the, person, recording, the, names, of, the, new, students, was, unable, to, understand, his, scottish, accent, his, older, brother, james, was, an, advocate, in, scotland, the, scottish, equivalent, of, a, barrister, in, england, and, his, family, decided, that, a, career, as, a, barrister, was, best, for, murray, the, scottish, bar, at, the, time, was, overcrowded, which, made, it, difficult, for, a, young, barrister, to, build, a, reputation, yet, qualifying, for, the, english, bar, was, extremely, expensive, thanks, to, the, patronage, of, thomas, foley, 1st, baron, foley, who, gave, murray, 200, a, year, to, live, on, murray, could, afford, to, study, at, the, bar, and, he, became, a, member, of, lincoln, s, inn, on, 23, april, 1724, after, george, i, died, on, 11, june, 1727, murray, entered, and, won, a, competition, to, write, a, latin, poem, titled, the, death, of, the, king, his, actions, were, seen, as, a, show, of, support, for, the, house, of, hanover, and, the, political, status, quo, something, odd, considering, the, strong, jacobite, sympathies, of, his, family, he, probably, did, this, because, having, no, private, income, he, wished, to, secure, patronage, to, help, him, advance, politically, another, entrant, was, william, pitt, who, was, a, constant, rival, to, murray, until, pitt, s, death, in, 1778, there, is, very, little, information, about, murray, s, time, at, oxford, it, is, known, that, he, studied, ancient, and, modern, history, became, fluent, in, french, and, gained, a, good, understanding, of, roman, law, he, also, became, fluent, in, latin, translating, cicero, s, works, into, english, and, then, back, into, latin, he, gained, his, bachelor, of, arts, degree, in, 1727, and, travelled, to, london, to, train, as, a, barrister, murray, married, lady, elizabeth, finch, youngest, daughter, of, daniel, finch, 2nd, earl, of, nottingham, and, 7th, earl, of, winchilsea, and, anne, hatton, they, had, no, children, of, their, own, but, took, care, of, their, great, niece, lady, elizabeth, murray, born, 1760, the, daughter, of, mansfield, s, nephew, and, heir, david, murray, 7th, viscount, stormont, after, her, mother, died, when, mansfield, s, other, nephew, sir, john, lindsay, returned, to, britain, in, 1765, following, the, seven, years, war, and, his, assignment, in, the, west, indies, he, brought, his, illegitimate, daughter, dido, whose, mother, maria, bell, was, an, enslaved, woman, of, african, descent, dido, was, born, into, slavery, in, 1761, dido, elizabeth, belle, was, baptized, november, 1766, in, london, 8, months, after, lady, elizabeth, s, arrival, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, mansfield, took, dido, in, to, provide, grieving, lady, elizabeth, with, a, companion, who, would, later, be, her, personal, attendant, mansfield, also, helped, mentor, his, nephew, and, heir, david, murray, 7th, viscount, stormont, later, his, nieces, and, unmarried, sisters, of, lord, stormont, lady, anne, and, lady, marjory, murray, would, come, to, live, at, kenwood, to, care, for, lord, and, lady, mansfield, in, their, old, age, murray, s, first, contact, when, he, moved, to, london, was, william, hamilton, a, scottish, born, barrister, who, was, said, to, be, the, first, scot, to, practise, at, the, english, bar, and, one, of, the, few, people, who, was, qualified, to, act, as, a, barrister, in, both, england, and, scotland, hamilton, had, been, one, of, murray, s, sponsors, when, he, joined, lincoln, s, inn, in, 1724, and, when, murray, came, to, london, hamilton, helped, find, him, a, set, of, barristers, chambers, at, no, 1, old, square, there, was, no, formal, legal, education, at, this, time, and, the, only, requirement, for, a, person, to, be, called, to, the, bar, was, for, him, to, have, eaten, five, dinners, a, term, at, lincoln, s, inn, and, to, have, read, the, first, sentence, of, a, paper, prepared, for, him, by, the, steward, thus, most, of, murray, s, practical, training, came, from, reading, the, papers, in, hamilton, s, chambers, and, listening, to, lord, raymond, speak, in, court, along, with, tutoring, by, thomas, denison, on, how, to, write, special, pleadings, murray, also, studied, various, texts, including, the, french, ordinance, de, la, marine, a, predecessor, to, the, napoleonic, commercial, code, the, works, of, bracton, and, littleton, and, crabbed, and, uncouth, compositions, on, municipal, law, murray, was, called, to, the, bar, on, 23, november, 1730, taking, a, set, of, chambers, at, 5, king, s, bench, walk, he, was, introduced, to, alexander, pope, around, this, time, and, through, his, friendship, met, members, of, the, aristocracy, some, of, whom, later, became, his, clients, including, sarah, churchill, duchess, of, marlborough, pope, also, taught, him, oratory, which, helped, him, enormously, in, court, his, first, two, cases, were, in, the, english, court, of, sessions, in, 1733, where, he, was, led, by, charles, talbot, and, opposed, by, philip, yorke, the, support, of, talbot, and, yorke, allowed, him, to, gain, a, respectable, practice, in, the, court, of, chancery, murray, used, his, first, professional, earnings, to, purchase, a, china, and, silver, plate, tea, set, for, his, kind, sister, in, law, lady, stormont, mother, of, his, nephew, david, murray, 7th, viscount, stormont, lady, stormont, may, have, provided, murray, with, some, financial, support, while, he, was, a, law, student, on, top, of, sending, him, food, packages, including, his, favorite, scottish, marmalade, when, he, was, a, young, lawyer, the, 1707, acts, of, union, had, merged, the, kingdom, of, england, and, kingdom, of, scotland, into, one, national, entity, but, they, retained, separate, legal, systems, however, the, house, of, lords, became, the, highest, court, of, appeal, in, both, english, and, scottish, law, and, as, a, result, from, 1707, scottish, cases, on, appeal, from, the, court, of, session, were, sent, there, a, barrister, had, to, be, familiar, with, both, scottish, and, english, law, to, deal, with, these, cases, and, murray, found, his, niche, acting, in, scottish, cases, in, the, house, of, lords, as, early, as, 1733, his, work, in, moncrieff, v, moncrieff, in, 1734, established, murray, as, a, brilliant, young, barrister, praised, for, his, performance, by, lords, cowper, and, parker, after, moncrieff, murray, was, involved, in, almost, every, case, in, the, house, of, lords, whether, it, had, been, appealed, from, a, scottish, court, or, not, in, 1737, murray, acted, as, counsel, for, the, city, of, edinburgh, in, the, aftermath, of, the, death, of, captain, john, porteous, in, edinburgh, it, was, traditional, for, criminals, sentenced, to, death, to, be, allowed, to, visit, a, church, near, the, city, jail, the, sunday, before, the, execution, two, criminals, named, wilson, and, robertson, took, this, as, an, opportunity, to, escape, although, wilson, did, not, make, it, out, of, the, church, robertson, escaped, completely, wilson, had, been, a, smuggler, who, supplied, his, fellow, citizens, with, goods, and, because, of, this, and, the, unpopularity, of, the, city, guard, public, opinion, was, firmly, on, his, side, porteous, was, the, captain, of, the, edinburgh, city, guard, and, was, angry, with, wilson, s, attempt, to, escape, and, aware, of, the, possibility, of, an, attempt, to, free, him, porteous, ordered, a, guard, of, 80, men, to, be, placed, around, the, gallows, for, wilson, s, execution, when, a, man, attempted, to, cut, wilson, s, body, down, after, the, execution, porteous, ordered, his, troops, to, fire, on, the, crowd, and, seven, people, were, killed, porteous, was, initially, sentenced, to, death, for, murder, and, when, the, execution, was, delayed, a, mob, of, citizens, rushed, the, city, jail, and, lynched, him, as, a, result, a, bill, was, proposed, in, the, house, of, commons, that, sought, to, punish, the, city, of, edinburgh, for, the, behaviour, of, its, citizens, by, disenfranchising, the, city, murray, represented, the, city, in, both, the, house, of, commons, and, the, house, of, lords, and, eventually, whittled, down, the, bill, so, much, that, by, the, time, it, was, voted, on, it, simply, proposed, to, fine, the, city, and, disqualify, the, provost, in, exchange, for, his, work, the, citizens, of, edinburgh, gave, him, the, freedom, of, the, city, and, a, diamond, which, is, still, in, the, possession, of, his, family, murray, s, reputation, continued, to, grow, in, 1738, he, was, involved, in, 11, of, the, 16, cases, heard, in, the, house, of, lords, and, in, 1739, and, 1740, he, acted, as, legal, counsel, in, 30, cases, there, on, 20, september, 1738, he, married, lady, elizabeth, finch, the, daughter, of, daniel, finch, 2nd, earl, of, nottingham, 7th, earl, of, winchilsea, and, anne, hatton, at, raby, castle, home, of, her, sister, duchess, of, cleveland, in, durham, her, other, sisters, included, duchess, of, somerset, duchess, of, roxburghe, and, lady, mary, who, was, married, to, thomas, watson, wentworth, 1st, marquess, of, rockingham, some, of, the, aristocrats, thought, that, the, bride, had, married, way, below, her, status, and, they, also, accused, the, groom, at, the, time, just, mr, murray, of, social, climbing, into, one, of, the, great, english, families, which, the, finches, belonged, to, indeed, mansfield, s, marriage, helped, him, be, accepted, by, the, highest, level, of, the, aristocracy, murray, s, connection, with, the, marquess, of, rockingham, especially, had, a, significant, positive, influence, on, his, future, career, after, a, short, holiday, murray, returned, to, his, work, as, a, barrister, murray, had, repeatedly, refused, to, become, a, member, of, parliament, saying, he, had, no, interest, in, politics, in, 1742, however, the, government, of, sir, robert, walpole, fell, and, murray, s, brother, in, law, the, earl, of, nottingham, became, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, in, the, new, cabinet, with, this, added, political, influence, murray, hoped, to, be, appointed, to, a, government, office, and, when, sir, john, strange, resigned, as, solicitor, general, murray, was, made, a, member, of, parliament, for, boroughbridge, on, 15, december, 1742, and, immediately, succeeded, strange, as, solicitor, general, although, the, solicitor, general, was, the, lowest, legal, appointment, a, successful, one, could, be, appointed, attorney, general, and, by, custom, the, attorney, general, was, allowed, to, become, lord, chief, justice, if, a, vacancy, arose, although, many, barristers, were, not, good, politicians, murray, became, a, successful, member, of, parliament, and, one, noted, for, his, oratorical, skills, and, logical, arguments, in, 1745, murray, defended, the, actions, of, the, government, in, hiring, 16, 000, hanoverian, troops, to, help, fight, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, his, argument, that, it, was, the, prerogative, of, the, king, to, decide, how, a, war, should, be, fought, and, he, should, not, be, second, guessed, by, politicians, with, no, experience, of, warfare, defeated, the, motion, to, cease, employing, the, hanoverian, troops, by, 231, votes, to, 181, murray, became, popular, with, both, the, government, and, george, ii, as, a, result, and, in, the, absence, of, a, strong, attorney, general, murray, spoke, for, the, government, in, most, matters, in, 1747, he, helped, lord, hardwicke, write, and, pass, an, act, to, abolish, the, old, hereditary, positions, in, scotland, in, 1751, he, drafted, the, government, response, to, an, attempt, by, the, king, of, prussia, to, frustrate, neutral, shipping, which, lord, stowell, called, the, foundation, of, the, modern, law, of, neutrality, and, montesquieu, described, it, as, a, r, sponse, sans, r, plique, response, without, a, reply, the, death, of, frederick, the, heir, to, the, british, throne, on, 20, march, 1751, caused, constitutional, chaos, george, ii, wished, to, appoint, his, favourite, son, prince, william, duke, of, cumberland, as, regent, since, the, heir, apparent, george, iii, was, only, a, child, while, the, public, favoured, the, child, s, mother, princess, augusta, in, an, attempt, to, reach, a, compromise, the, government, introduced, a, bill, to, parliament, declaring, that, augusta, was, to, be, a, regent, along, with, a, council, of, others, and, that, george, would, become, the, heir, when, he, reached, maturity, murray, made, a, speech, supporting, the, government, s, proposal, but, despite, this, parliament, was, not, convinced, that, a, council, was, necessary, on, 6, march, 1754, the, prime, minister, henry, pelham, died, and, this, necessitated, a, cabinet, reshuffle, the, attorney, general, sir, dudley, ryder, became, lord, chief, justice, of, the, king, s, bench, and, murray, became, attorney, general, in, his, place, a, few, months, later, the, master, of, the, rolls, died, and, murray, was, asked, to, replace, him, he, declined, however, as, he, did, not, want, to, leave, his, majesty, s, service, after, ryder, died, unexpectedly, on, 25, may, 1756, however, murray, could, not, turn, down, the, opportunity, and, immediately, applied, to, replace, him, as, lord, chief, justice, he, was, accepted, and, although, his, appointment, delighted, murray, the, government, was, very, concerned, at, the, loss, of, a, good, attorney, general, in, an, attempt, to, persuade, him, to, stay, the, new, prime, minister, the, duke, of, newcastle, offered, him, the, post, of, chancellor, of, the, duchy, of, lancaster, in, addition, to, the, position, of, attorney, general, an, extra, 6, 000, a, year, and, a, pension, and, finally, attempted, to, blackmail, him, by, saying, that, if, he, accepted, the, office, of, lord, chief, justice, the, government, would, refuse, to, grant, him, a, peerage, it, was, customary, for, all, lord, chief, justices, to, be, given, a, peerage, and, murray, responded, by, saying, that, in, that, situation, he, would, refuse, to, become, either, lord, chief, justice, or, attorney, general, newcastle, gave, in, and, promised, to, allow, him, to, become, lord, chief, justice, and, to, recommend, him, for, a, peerage, this, was, seen, as, an, excellent, result, by, murray, who, had, no, interest, in, politics, except, as, a, stepping, stone, to, become, a, member, of, the, judiciary, murray, was, not, suited, to, politics, as, he, was, far, too, calculating, and, independent, of, thought, to, accept, any, one, party, s, doctrine, his, scottish, and, jacobite, roots, also, allowed, for, endless, insinuation, and, controversy, in, 1753, he, was, accused, by, the, bishop, of, gloucester, of, having, drunk, the, health, of, the, old, pretender, on, his, knees, although, the, story, was, proven, to, be, false, it, embarrassed, murray, and, was, used, to, taunt, him, as, late, as, 1770, his, rivalry, with, william, pitt, highlighted, his, unsuitability, for, politics, unlike, such, other, politicians, as, philip, yorke, and, edward, thurlow, he, did, not, have, the, temperament, to, resist, the, vehemence, of, pitt, s, invective, it, was, widely, felt, that, he, could, have, become, prime, minister, after, the, death, of, henry, pelham, but, it, would, have, set, in, a, false, environment, and, he, declined, all, opportunities, to, return, to, politics, except, as, lord, chief, justice, anyone, wishing, to, become, a, judge, was, required, to, be, a, serjeant, at, law, which, murray, was, not, as, such, he, left, lincoln, s, inn, to, join, serjeant, s, inn, he, qualified, as, a, serjeant, at, law, on, 8, november, 1756, and, was, sworn, in, as, lord, chief, justice, at, the, house, of, the, lord, chancellor, that, evening, immediately, afterwards, he, was, created, baron, mansfield, on, 19, november, he, was, sworn, in, as, a, privy, counsellor, he, suspended, his, duties, temporarily, on, 5, april, 1757, when, appointed, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, due, to, an, old, custom, that, the, lord, chief, justice, took, the, position, when, it, was, empty, he, only, served, until, 8, april, and, there, is, no, evidence, of, his, performing, anything, more, than, the, standard, day, to, day, duties, he, became, a, cabinet, minister, in, 1757, still, serving, as, lord, chief, justice, and, stayed, until, 1765, mansfield, first, sat, in, court, on, 11, november, 1756, and, at, the, time, had, a, very, low, estimate, of, the, common, law, of, england, which, he, was, to, administer, the, legal, system, had, been, put, together, in, the, period, immediately, after, the, norman, conquest, of, england, and, was, completely, unsuited, to, the, 18th, century, when, britain, was, the, greatest, manufacturing, and, commercial, country, in, the, world, mansfield, immediately, began, to, reform, the, way, the, law, and, courts, worked, one, of, his, first, acts, as, lord, chief, justice, was, to, change, the, system, for, submitting, motions, every, day, the, court, was, in, session, all, barristers, were, invited, to, submit, motions, in, order, of, their, seniority, as, barristers, because, they, were, allowed, to, submit, as, many, motions, as, they, wanted, by, the, time, junior, barristers, were, allowed, to, submit, their, motions, it, was, normally, the, end, of, the, day, this, meant, that, almost, all, the, work, went, to, the, senior, barristers, who, were, so, overworked, that, they, often, did, not, have, time, to, prepare, properly, before, going, to, court, in, addition, it, meant, that, work, for, junior, barristers, was, scarce, hindering, their, careers, mansfield, changed, the, system, so, that, barristers, were, allowed, to, submit, only, one, motion, a, day, and, if, not, all, barristers, had, been, heard, by, the, end, of, the, day, they, could, continue, where, they, left, off, the, next, morning, at, the, time, it, was, also, traditional, for, all, judgments, to, be, reserved, although, in, a, small, number, of, cases, this, was, useful, in, the, majority, of, cases, it, simply, made, coming, to, court, more, expensive, and, wasted, time, as, soon, as, mansfield, became, lord, chief, justice, he, changed, the, rules, so, that, unless, the, court, had, doubts, over, the, evidence, presented, to, them, a, judgment, was, to, be, made, immediately, this, had, a, far, reaching, effect, on, the, english, courts, judges, from, the, court, of, appeal, and, high, court, of, justice, now, give, reserved, judgments, in, only, a, minority, of, cases, his, reforms, led, to, the, court, of, king, s, bench, becoming, one, of, the, most, active, courts, at, the, expense, of, the, court, of, common, pleas, which, was, described, as, the, sleepy, hollow, in, the, eighteenth, century, english, merchant, law, was, still, based, on, the, lex, mercatoria, a, medieval, series, of, customs, and, principles, used, to, regulate, trading, other, countries, in, europe, had, reformed, and, modernised, their, law, resulting, in, english, merchant, law, being, about, a, century, behind, mercantile, law, of, other, european, countries, a, merchant, was, by, his, very, nature, international, and, the, inconsistencies, between, english, law, and, the, law, of, other, nations, made, business, difficult, mansfield, made, a, great, effort, to, bring, english, merchant, law, up, to, the, same, standards, as, that, of, other, european, nations, defining, his, position, by, saying, that, the, daily, negotiations, and, property, of, merchants, ought, not, to, depend, on, subtleties, and, niceties, but, upon, rules, easily, learned, and, easily, retained, because, they, are, dictates, of, common, sense, drawn, from, the, truth, of, the, case, in, most, european, countries, the, principle, was, that, a, merchant, was, bound, by, his, promises, not, just, his, signed, legal, documents, while, english, lawyers, maintained, that, a, merchant, could, only, be, legally, bound, by, documents, that, he, signed, the, european, principle, was, based, on, the, assumption, of, good, faith, on, the, part, of, the, merchants, or, uberrima, fides, something, completely, lacking, in, english, law, in, carter, v, boehm, 1746, 3, burr, 1905, 96, er, 342, mansfield, got, a, chance, to, reform, the, law, relating, to, the, assumption, of, good, faith, carter, was, the, governor, of, fort, marlborough, now, bengkulu, which, was, built, by, the, british, east, india, company, in, sumatra, indonesia, he, took, out, an, insurance, policy, with, boehm, against, the, fort, s, being, taken, by, a, foreign, enemy, a, witness, called, captain, tryon, testified, that, carter, knew, the, fort, was, built, to, resist, attacks, from, natives, but, not, european, enemies, and, the, french, were, likely, to, attack, the, french, did, attack, and, boehm, refused, to, fulfil, the, insurance, claim, mansfield, decided, in, favour, of, boehm, saying, that, carter, had, failed, his, duty, of, uberrima, fides, in, his, judgment, mansfield, said, that, insurance, is, a, contract, based, upon, speculation, the, special, facts, upon, which, the, contingent, chance, is, to, be, computed, lie, most, commonly, in, the, knowledge, of, the, insured, only, the, underwriter, trusts, to, his, representation, and, proceeds, upon, the, confidence, that, he, does, not, keep, back, any, circumstance, in, his, knowledge, to, mislead, the, underwriter, into, a, belief, that, the, circumstance, does, not, exist, and, to, induce, him, to, estimate, the, risque, as, if, it, did, not, exist, good, faith, forbids, either, party, by, concealing, what, he, privately, knows, to, draw, the, other, into, a, bargain, from, his, ignorance, of, that, fact, and, his, believing, the, contrary, this, was, an, attempt, by, mansfield, to, introduce, the, assumption, of, good, faith, into, english, law, and, although, it, failed, for, the, most, part, as, most, areas, of, english, commercial, law, no, longer, use, uberrima, fides, it, is, still, used, in, insurance, contracts, in, insurance, agreements, the, insuree, inevitably, knows, more, about, the, risk, involved, than, the, insurer, without, the, requirement, for, pre, contractual, good, faith, the, insuree, would, have, no, reason, to, tell, the, truth, and, insurance, companies, would, be, loath, to, make, contracts, in, the, earlier, case, of, pillans, rose, v, van, mierop, hopkins, 1765, 3, burr, 1663, 97, er, 1035, mansfield, had, tried, to, challenge, the, doctrine, of, consideration, in, english, law, consideration, is, a, vital, part, of, the, contract, without, valid, consideration, almost, any, contract, is, void, but, mansfield, argued, in, his, judgment, that, it, should, only, be, treated, as, evidence, of, a, contract, not, as, a, vital, element, mansfield, failed, to, make, clear, that, he, was, referring, only, to, consideration, in, commercial, contracts, not, general, contracts, and, as, a, result, his, judgment, read, that, consideration, was, not, required, for, any, contract, his, judgment, has, been, much, criticised, by, legal, academics, and, was, effectively, overruled, by, the, house, of, lords, in, rann, v, hughes, 7, t, r, 350, mansfield, also, enforced, a, previous, judgement, of, the, court, of, king, s, bench, made, in, 1645, in, which, they, allowed, a, special, jury, of, merchants, to, sit, in, cases, involving, commercial, law, he, built, up, a, special, corps, of, these, jurymen, some, of, whom, such, as, edward, vaux, became, noted, experts, on, commercial, law, lord, mansfield, s, jurymen, acted, as, an, effective, liaison, between, the, merchants, and, the, courts, mansfield, was, personally, a, supporter, of, free, trade, who, was, heavily, influenced, by, roman, law, and, ancient, roman, and, greek, writers, such, as, cicero, and, xenophon, in, 1783, mansfield, heard, the, case, of, gregson, v, gilbert, 1783, 3, doug, 232, 99, er, 629, regarding, the, payment, of, an, insurance, claim, for, slaves, killed, when, thrown, overboard, by, the, captain, of, a, slave, ship, an, event, now, known, as, the, zong, massacre, mansfield, in, summing, up, the, jury, s, verdict, said, the, case, of, slaves, was, the, same, as, if, horses, had, been, thrown, over, board, and, endeavoured, to, uphold, the, notion, that, slaves, were, property, which, could, be, destroyed, in, situations, of, absolute, necessity, but, new, information, was, introduced, in, the, case, and, he, ruled, against, the, owners, of, the, ship, in, doing, this, he, achieved, his, aim, of, preventing, maritime, insurance, law, from, becoming, more, complicated, mansfield, made, another, notable, judgment, in, millar, v, taylor, 1769, 4, burr, 2303, 98, er, 201, 20, april, 1769, in, relation, to, copyright, law, andrew, millar, was, a, bookseller, who, in, 1729, had, purchased, the, publishing, rights, to, james, thomson, s, poem, the, seasons, after, the, term, of, the, exclusive, rights, granted, under, the, statute, of, anne, expired, robert, taylor, began, publishing, his, own, competing, publication, which, contained, thomson, s, poem, mansfield, sitting, with, three, other, judges, concluded, that, despite, the, statute, of, anne, there, was, a, perpetual, common, law, copyright, and, therefore, that, no, works, can, ever, be, considered, public, domain, this, was, a, massive, victory, for, booksellers, and, publishers, as, it, meant, that, they, could, effectively, make, it, impossible, for, new, companies, to, compete, as, in, the, absence, of, new, texts, there, was, nothing, they, could, print, mansfield, s, judgment, was, finally, overruled, by, the, house, of, lords, in, donaldson, v, beckett, in, 1774, mansfield, s, judgment, has, been, criticised, as, being, unusually, short, sighted, because, he, failed, to, see, that, while, his, decision, was, correct, for, that, particular, case, the, precedent, it, would, set, would, create, an, unfair, monopoly, for, the, booksellers, and, publishers, this, was, one, of, only, a, small, number, of, cases, in, which, mansfield, was, overruled, in, his, entire, career, only, six, of, his, judgments, were, overturned, by, a, higher, court, mansfield, s, judgement, here, has, been, seen, as, part, of, a, wider, agenda, along, with, other, legal, figures, such, as, sir, william, blackstone, he, was, personally, in, favour, of, a, perpetual, copyright, in, 1695, parliament, failed, to, renew, the, licensing, acts, and, as, a, result, the, press, were, free, to, print, material, attacking, the, government, although, there, were, eight, attempts, to, force, a, new, licensing, act, through, parliament, between, 1697, and, 1713, none, of, them, succeeded, despite, the, freedom, of, the, press, from, pre, censorship, by, the, government, the, judiciary, regularly, tried, people, for, seditious, libel, if, they, printed, material, attacking, the, government, from, 21, november, 1768, letters, written, by, a, man, under, the, pseudonym, of, junius, were, published, in, the, public, advertiser, a, london, newspaper, run, by, henry, sampson, woodfall, in, them, junius, attacked, many, political, leaders, including, lord, granby, and, mansfield, as, his, letters, were, wildly, popular, the, circulation, of, the, public, advertiser, doubled, in, just, five, months, on, 19, december, 1769, junius, wrote, a, letter, attacking, the, king, and, incensed, at, this, the, government, ordered, several, people, to, be, arrested, and, tried, for, seditious, libel, including, woodfall, for, publishing, the, letters, john, almon, for, selling, them, and, john, miller, for, republishing, them, almon, s, case, was, heard, at, westminster, hall, by, mansfield, and, a, jury, on, 2, june, 1770, he, was, found, guilty, although, it, is, unclear, in, what, fashion, he, was, punished, if, at, all, woodfall, was, tried, on, 13, june, 1770, by, mansfield, and, a, jury, while, mansfield, believed, that, the, language, used, was, libellous, the, jury, disagreed, and, held, that, he, was, guilty, of, printing, and, publishing, only, and, innocent, of, seditious, libel, miller, was, tried, on, 13, july, 1770, and, after, six, hours, of, discussion, the, jury, found, him, innocent, as, a, result, of, these, two, trials, it, became, clear, that, no, jury, would, convict, a, printer, for, printing, these, letters, leaving, junius, free, to, continue, publishing, them, on, 14, november, 1770, a, letter, by, junius, directed, at, mansfield, was, published, by, the, public, advertiser, and, the, london, evening, post, a, newspaper, run, by, john, miller, in, it, junius, attacked, mansfield, first, for, being, scottish, then, for, being, a, lapsed, jacobite, and, finally, for, attempting, to, suppress, the, freedom, of, the, press, in, a, response, to, junius, letter, dated, 16, november, 1770, mansfield, made, the, following, threat, although, the, attorney, general, william, de, grey, advised, that, the, publishers, should, again, be, prosecuted, mansfield, disagreed, saying, that, if, they, failed, to, respond, to, junius, he, would, become, bored, and, stop, writing, mansfield, was, evidently, correct, because, other, than, a, letter, printed, on, 5, october, 1771, junius, ceased, to, write, at, the, beginning, of, 1772, mansfield, is, best, known, for, his, judgment, in, somersett, s, case, on, the, legality, of, keeping, slaves, in, england, the, english, had, been, involved, in, the, slave, trade, since, 1553, and, by, 1768, ships, registered, in, liverpool, bristol, and, london, carried, more, than, half, the, slaves, shipped, in, the, world, james, somersett, was, a, slave, owned, by, charles, stewart, an, american, customs, officer, who, sailed, to, britain, for, business, landing, on, 10, november, 1769, a, few, days, later, somersett, attempted, to, escape, he, was, recaptured, in, november, and, imprisoned, on, the, ship, ann, and, mary, owned, by, captain, john, knowles, and, bound, for, the, british, colony, of, jamaica, stewart, intended, to, sell, him, there, however, three, people, claiming, to, be, somersett, s, godparents, john, marlow, thomas, walkin, and, elizabeth, cade, made, an, application, before, the, court, of, king, s, bench, for, a, writ, of, habeas, corpus, and, captain, knowles, was, ordered, to, produce, somersett, before, the, court, of, king, s, bench, which, would, determine, whether, his, imprisonment, was, legal, mansfield, ordered, a, hearing, for, 22, january, 1772, following, an, adjournment, the, case, was, not, heard, until, 7, february, 1772, in, the, meantime, the, case, had, attracted, a, great, deal, of, attention, in, the, press, and, members, of, the, public, were, forthcoming, with, donations, to, fund, lawyers, for, both, sides, of, the, argument, an, activist, layman, granville, sharp, who, continually, sought, test, cases, against, the, legal, justifications, for, slavery, was, somersett, s, real, backer, when, the, case, was, heard, no, fewer, than, five, advocates, appeared, for, the, slave, speaking, at, three, separate, hearings, between, february, and, may, these, lawyers, included, william, davy, sl, john, glynn, sl, james, mansfield, and, francis, hargrave, who, was, later, to, become, a, noted, barrister, based, on, his, work, in, this, case, charles, stewart, was, represented, by, john, dunning, and, james, wallace, on, behalf, of, somersett, it, was, argued, that, while, colonial, laws, might, permit, slavery, neither, the, common, law, of, england, nor, any, law, made, by, parliament, recognised, the, existence, of, slavery, and, slavery, was, therefore, illegal, moreover, english, contract, law, did, not, allow, for, any, person, to, enslave, himself, nor, could, any, contract, be, binding, without, the, person, s, consent, the, arguments, thus, focused, on, legal, details, rather, than, humanitarian, principles, a, law, passed, in, 1765, said, that, all, lands, forts, and, slaves, owned, by, the, africa, company, were, a, property, of, the, crown, which, could, be, interpreted, to, mean, that, the, crown, accepted, slavery, when, the, two, lawyers, for, charles, stewart, put, their, case, they, argued, that, a, contract, for, the, sale, of, a, slave, was, recognised, in, england, and, therefore, the, existence, of, slaves, must, be, legally, valid, after, the, attorneys, for, both, sides, had, given, their, arguments, mansfield, called, a, recess, saying, that, required, consultation, among, the, twelve, judges, finally, on, 22, june, 1772, mansfield, gave, his, judgment, which, ruled, that, a, master, could, not, carry, his, slave, out, of, england, by, force, and, concluded, the, state, of, slavery, is, of, such, a, nature, that, it, is, incapable, of, being, introduced, on, any, reasons, moral, or, political, but, only, positive, law, which, preserves, its, force, long, after, the, reasons, occasion, and, time, itself, from, whence, it, was, created, is, erased, from, memory, it, s, so, odious, that, nothing, can, be, suffered, to, support, it, but, positive, law, whatever, inconveniences, therefore, may, follow, from, a, decision, i, cannot, say, this, case, is, allowed, or, approved, by, the, law, of, england, and, therefore, the, black, must, be, discharged, the, ruling, alongside, criticising, slavery, also, conclusively, established, that, there, was, no, legal, status, of, slave, in, either, parliamentary, legislation, or, the, common, law, this, did, not, effect, slavery, in, the, british, empire, which, would, not, be, done, until, the, passage, of, the, 1833, slavery, abolition, act, through, parliament, as, a, result, of, the, reporting, of, mansfield, s, decision, public, opinion, and, some, newspapers, gave, the, impression, that, slavery, had, been, abolished, in, england, by, the, ruling, some, historians, believe, that, between, 14, 000, and, 15, 000, slaves, were, immediately, freed, in, england, some, of, whom, remained, with, their, masters, as, paid, or, unpaid, employees, however, it, is, questionable, whether, that, many, black, people, lived, in, england, at, the, time, and, those, who, did, were, mostly, free, already, despite, the, ruling, black, britons, were, occasionally, kidnapped, in, the, streets, of, london, liverpool, and, bristol, and, forcibly, brought, back, to, the, colonies, such, an, incident, was, recounted, by, olaudah, equiano, in, 1774, in, his, autobiography, an, interesting, narrative, 1789, contemporary, reports, suggested, that, mansfield, s, personal, experience, with, raising, dido, belle, influenced, his, decision, lord, mansfield, is, frequently, mentioned, in, modern, legal, settings, as, the, originator, of, lord, mansfield, s, rule, in, his, own, words, the, law, of, england, is, clear, that, the, declarations, of, a, father, or, mother, cannot, be, admitted, to, bastardize, the, issue, born, after, marriage, this, quote, comes, from, mansfield, s, appellate, decision, in, goodright, v, moss, 1777, 2, cowp, 591, 98, er, 1257, at, 592, the, primary, legal, question, in, the, case, was, not, this, preexisting, principle, which, applies, only, to, children, born, after, marriage, but, rather, whether, the, child, had, been, born, before, the, marriage, the, question, was, whether, statements, the, child, s, parents, allegedly, made, before, their, deaths, could, be, introduced, as, evidence, that, the, child, had, been, born, before, their, marriage, and, was, thus, illegitimate, mansfield, ruled, to, admit, the, testimony, against, the, child, s, legitimacy, and, grant, a, new, trial, the, term, lord, mansfield, s, rule, is, often, used, in, a, slightly, different, sense, to, denote, the, principle, still, applied, in, several, jurisdictions, that, marriage, creates, a, conclusive, presumption, of, a, husband, s, paternity, of, his, wife, s, child, after, the, formation, of, the, fox, north, coalition, mansfield, agreed, to, act, as, speaker, of, the, house, of, lords, taking, up, his, post, in, february, 1783, the, main, item, of, debate, during, the, coalition, ministry, was, the, east, india, bill, which, provoked, bitter, arguments, in, both, the, house, of, lords, and, house, of, commons, in, an, attempt, to, speed, up, the, process, of, passing, the, bill, mansfield, left, his, position, as, speaker, to, debate, directly, on, 15, december, when, this, failed, to, help, he, returned, to, the, woolsack, the, next, day, the, failure, of, the, bill, caused, the, government, to, be, immediately, dismissed, and, mansfield, left, his, position, on, 23, december, 1783, mansfield, had, been, made, earl, of, mansfield, in, the, county, of, nottingham, on, 31, october, 1776, he, attended, the, lords, as, lord, speaker, and, the, last, record, of, him, attending, other, than, his, presence, at, the, state, opening, of, parliament, on, 23, march, 1784, was, in, december, 1783, despite, failing, health, mansfield, refused, to, officially, leave, his, post, as, lord, chief, justice, because, george, iii, was, opposed, to, the, appointment, of, mansfield, s, prot, g, francis, buller, to, the, position, after, mansfield, resigned, the, government, of, the, time, instead, suggested, lloyd, kenyon, as, a, possible, successor, mansfield, clung, to, office, until, 1788, despite, not, sitting, in, court, for, two, years, in, the, hope, that, the, government, would, fall, before, he, was, forced, to, retire, this, was, not, to, be, and, on, 3, june, he, wrote, a, letter, of, resignation, effective, the, next, day, mansfield, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, at, kenwood, house, looked, after, by, his, nieces, lady, anne, and, lady, marjory, murray, and, dido, belle, most, of, his, time, was, spent, maintaining, the, grounds, when, fanny, burney, visited, kenwood, in, june, 1792, she, was, unable, to, see, lord, mansfield, because, he, was, too, infirm, and, hasn, t, been, downstairs, for, 4, years, she, asked, after, miss, murrays, and, left, her, respects, but, miss, murrays, were, upstairs, with, lord, mansfield, whom, they, never, left, in, the, summer, he, was, visited, by, groups, of, barristers, who, informed, him, of, the, goings, on, at, court, on, 1, august, 1792, he, was, made, earl, of, mansfield, in, the, county, of, middlesex, on, 10, march, 1793, he, complained, of, feeling, sleepy, and, although, he, recovered, the, next, day, by, 12, march, he, was, again, complaining, of, a, need, for, sleep, he, went, to, bed, early, and, remained, asleep, until, 18, march, when, he, finally, died, his, body, was, buried, in, the, north, transept, of, westminster, abbey, his, monument, at, westminster, was, commissioned, by, his, nephew, it, was, sculpted, by, john, flaxman, ra, by, suggestion, of, sir, william, hamilton, mansfield, left, a, large, amount, of, money, after, his, death, including, estate, worth, 500, 000, to, his, nephew, now, the, 2nd, earl, he, also, gave, 2, 000, to, francis, buller, english, law, saw, significant, changes, during, mansfield, s, career, as, lord, chief, justice, mansfield, had, done, much, to, reform, the, way, the, courts, worked, making, it, easier, for, people, to, gain, access, to, legal, aid, and, also, making, the, process, much, less, expensive, he, was, also, noted, for, his, insistence, that, equity, should, be, applied, by, all, courts, not, just, the, court, of, chancery, a, view, that, provoked, much, disagreement, during, his, lifetime, but, was, eventually, confirmed, by, parliament, in, the, supreme, court, of, judicature, act, 1873, which, allowed, all, courts, to, take, cases, of, equity, he, also, established, the, principle, that, rather, than, blindly, following, precedent, judges, should, seek, to, find, loopholes, in, rules, that, were, no, longer, applicable, something, that, later, received, the, support, of, oliver, wendell, holmes, jr, who, said, it, is, revolting, to, have, no, better, reason, for, a, rule, of, law, than, that, so, it, was, laid, down, in, the, time, of, henry, iv, it, is, more, revolting, still, if, the, grounds, upon, which, it, was, laid, down, have, vanished, long, since, and, the, rule, simply, persists, from, blind, imitation, of, the, past, he, made, his, judgements, on, the, principle, that, as, the, usages, of, society, alter, the, law, must, adapt, itself, to, the, various, situations, of, mankind, leading, john, baker, to, describe, him, as, one, of, the, boldest, of, judicial, spirits, his, most, important, contributions, were, to, commercial, merchant, and, common, law, mansfield, spent, much, time, bringing, the, law, of, england, on, par, with, that, of, other, countries, particularly, in, cases, such, as, pillans, rose, v, van, mierop, hopkins, 3, burr, 1663, and, carter, v, boehm, 3, burr, 1905, as, a, result, of, his, work, he, was, described, by, a, later, judge, as, the, founder, of, the, commercial, law, of, this, country, he, was, however, criticised, for, his, resistance, to, the, freedom, of, the, press, and, his, refusal, to, go, against, the, king, as, well, as, for, blatant, nepotism, highlighted, by, his, attempts, to, have, francis, buller, made, lord, chief, justice, after, his, retirement, he, was, also, criticised, as, a, politician, for, his, support, of, a, government, antagonistic, to, the, colonies, in, 1829, john, quincy, adams, described, him, as, more, responsible, for, the, revolution, than, any, other, man, scholars, such, as, john, chipman, gray, have, questioned, his, reputation, as, a, universally, successful, judge, saying, that, the, reputation, of, lord, mansfield, as, a, commercial, lawyer, should, not, blind, us, to, the, fact, that, he, was, not, equally, great, in, the, law, of, real, property, opinion, over, mansfield, s, intention, in, his, ruling, in, somerset, s, case, is, mixed, with, the, current, prevailing, view, being, that, he, did, not, intend, to, free, the, slaves, the, judgment, was, particularly, narrow, as, it, ruled, only, that, a, master, could, not, carry, his, slave, out, of, england, by, force, not, that, slaves, who, came, to, england, were, emancipated, this, is, seen, as, particularly, telling, because, this, was, the, primary, argument, of, davy, and, hargrave, if, murray, had, wanted, to, emancipate, the, slaves, completely, there, were, various, bits, of, judicial, precedent, he, could, have, based, his, decision, on, such, as, smith, v, gould, or, shanley, v, harvey, but, he, did, not, various, comments, he, made, before, and, during, the, case, also, suggest, that, complete, emancipation, was, not, his, intent, in, a, preliminary, judgment, he, said, that, the, setting, 14, 000, or, 15, 000, men, at, once, free, loose, by, a, solemn, opinion, is, much, disagreeable, in, the, effect, it, threatens, which, one, modern, legal, scholar, interprets, as, indicative, of, his, reluctance, to, make, a, decision, for, fear, of, economic, consequences, various, comments, he, made, to, thomas, hutchinson, in, private, letters, along, with, his, comments, about, the, somersett, decision, in, r, v, inhabitants, of, thames, ditton, also, suggest, that, emancipation, was, not, his, goal, in, the, 1785, inhabitants, of, thames, ditton, case, lord, mansfield, expressed, the, view, that, his, ruling, in, the, somerset, case, decided, only, that, a, slave, could, not, be, forcibly, removed, from, england, against, his, will, mansfield, and, lady, finch, did, not, have, any, children, his, title, which, succeeds, to, this, day, passed, to, his, nephew, david, murray, 2nd, earl, of, mansfield, mansfield, is, immortalised, in, st, stephen, s, hall, where, he, and, other, notable, parliamentarians, look, on, at, visitors, to, parliament, here, murray, long, enough, his, country, s, pride, is, now, no, more, than, tully, or, than, hyde, foretold, by, ar, pope, and, fulfilled, in, the, year, 1793, when, william, earl, of, mansfield, died, full, of, years, and, of, honours, of, honours, he, declined, many, those, which, he, accepted, were, the, following, he, was, appointed, solicitor, general, 1742, attorney, general, 1754, lord, chief, justice, and, baron, mansfield, 1756, earl, of,
