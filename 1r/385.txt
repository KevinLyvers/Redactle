he, was, a, major, french, symbolist, poet, and, his, work, anticipated, and, inspired, several, revolutionary, artistic, schools, of, the, early, 20th, century, such, as, cubism, futurism, dadaism, and, surrealism, mallarm, was, born, in, paris, he, was, a, boarder, at, the, pensionnat, des, fr, res, des, coles, chr, tiennes, passy, between, 6, or, 9, october, 1852, and, march, 1855, he, worked, as, an, english, teacher, and, spent, much, of, his, life, in, relative, poverty, but, was, famed, for, his, salons, occasional, gatherings, of, intellectuals, at, his, house, on, the, rue, de, rome, for, discussions, of, poetry, art, and, philosophy, the, group, became, known, as, les, mardistes, because, they, met, on, tuesdays, in, french, mardi, and, through, it, mallarm, exerted, considerable, influence, on, the, work, of, a, generation, of, writers, for, many, years, those, sessions, where, mallarm, held, court, as, judge, jester, and, king, were, considered, the, heart, of, paris, intellectual, life, regular, visitors, included, w, b, yeats, rainer, maria, rilke, paul, val, ry, stefan, george, paul, verlaine, and, many, others, along, with, other, members, of, la, revue,

owes, a, great, deal, to, the, style, of, charles, baudelaire, who, was, recognised, as, the, forerunner, of, literary, symbolism, mallarm, s, later, fin, de, si, cle, style, on, the, other, hand, anticipates, many, of, the, fusions, between, poetry, and, the, other, arts, that, were, to, blossom, in, the, next, century, most, of, this, later, work, explored, the, relationship, between, content, and, form, between, the, text, and, the, arrangement, of, words, and, spaces, on, the, page, this, is, particularly, evident, in, his, last, major, poem, un, coup, de, d, s, jamais, n, abolira, le, hasard, a, roll, of, the, dice, will, never, abolish, chance, of, 1897, some, consider, mallarm, one, of, the, french, poets, most, difficult, to, translate, into, english, the, difficulty, is, due, in, part, to, the, complex, multilayered, nature, of, much, of, his, work, but, also, to, the, important, role, that, the, sound, of, the, words, rather, than, their, meaning, plays, in, his, poetry, when, recited, in, french, his, poems, allow, alternative, meanings, which, are, not, evident, on, reading, the, work, on, the, page, for, example, mallarm, s, sonnet, en, yx, opens, with, the, phrase, ses, purs, ongles, her, pure, nails, whose, first, syllables, when, spoken, aloud, sound, very, similar, to, the, words, c, est, pur, son, it, s, pure, sound, indeed, the, pure, sound, aspect, of, his, poetry, has, been, the, subject, of, musical, analysis, and, has, inspired, musical, compositions, these, phonetic, ambiguities, are, very, difficult, to, reproduce, in, a, translation, which, must, be, faithful, to, the, meaning, of, the, words, mallarm, s, poetry, has, been, the, inspiration, for, several, musical, pieces, notably, claude, debussy, s, pr, lude, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, 1894, a, free, interpretation, of, mallarm, s, poem, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, 1876, which, creates, powerful, impressions, by, the, use, of, striking, but, isolated, phrases, maurice, ravel, set, mallarm, s, poetry, to, music, in, trois, po, mes, de, mallarm, 1913, other, composers, to, use, his, poetry, in, song, include, darius, milhaud, chansons, bas, de, st, phane, mallarm, 1917, and, pierre, boulez, pli, selon, pli, 1957, 62, man, ray, s, last, film, entitled, les, myst, res, du, ch, teau, de, d, the, mystery, of, the, chateau, of, dice, 1929, was, greatly, influenced, by, mallarm, s, work, prominently, featuring, the, line, a, roll, of, the, dice, will, never, abolish, chance, mallarm, is, referred, to, extensively, in, the, latter, section, of, joris, karl, huysmans, rebours, where, des, esseintes, describes, his, fervour, infused, enthusiasm, for, the, poet, these, were, mallarm, s, masterpieces, and, also, ranked, among, the, masterpieces, of, prose, poetry, for, they, combined, a, style, so, magnificently, that, in, itself, it, was, as, soothing, as, a, melancholy, incantation, an, intoxicating, melody, with, irresistibly, suggestive, thoughts, the, soul, throbs, of, a, sensitive, artist, whose, quivering, nerves, vibrate, with, an, intensity, that, fills, you, with, a, painful, ecstasy, the, critic, and, translator, barbara, johnson, has, emphasized, mallarm, s, influence, on, twentieth, century, french, criticism, and, theory, it, was, largely, by, learning, the, lesson, of, mallarm, that, critics, like, roland, barthes, came, to, speak, of, the, death, of, the, author, in, the, making, of, literature, rather, than, seeing, the, text, as, the, emanation, of, an, individual, author, s, intentions, structuralists, and, deconstructors, followed, the, paths, and, patterns, of, the, linguistic, signifier, paying, new, attention, to, syntax, spacing, intertextuality, sound, semantics, etymology, and, even, individual, letters, the, theoretical, styles, of, jacques, derrida, julia, kristeva, maurice, blanchot, and, especially, jacques, lacan, also, owe, a, great, deal, to, mallarm, s, critical, poem, it, has, been, suggested, that, much, of, mallarm, s, work, influenced, the, conception, of, hypertext, with, his, purposeful, use, of, blank, space, and, careful, placement, of, words, on, the, page, allowing, multiple, non, linear, readings, of, the, text, this, becomes, very, apparent, in, his, work, un, coup, de, d, s, in, 1990, greenhouse, review, press, published, d, j, waldie, s, american, translation, of, un, coup, de, d, s, in, a, letterpress, edition, of, 60, copies, its, typography, and, format, based, on, examination, of, the, final, or, near, final, corrected,
