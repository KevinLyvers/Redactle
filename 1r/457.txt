the, trust, this, was, when, tarbell, established, a, style, that, would, carry, throughout, her, career, tarbell, would, imbue, her, articles, essays, and, books, with, moral, content, grounded, in, her, unwavering, rectitude, that, rectitude, while, sometimes, suggesting, inflexibility, drove, her, instincts, for, reform, a, vital, element, in, her, future, confrontation, with, rockefeller,

for, inspiration, and, as, subject, matter, for, her, writing, the, real, reason, for, the, fall, out, with, flood, remains, a, mystery, but, one, reason, may, have, been, the, placement, of, his,

of, the, french, revolution, 18th, century, literature, and, period, painting, she, learned, from, french, historians, how, to, present, evidence, in, a, clear, compelling, style, what, tarbell, discovered, about, madame, roland, changed, her, own, worldview, she, began, the, biography, with, admiration, for, roland, but, grew, disillusioned, as, she, researched, and, learned, more, tarbell, determined, that, roland, who, followed, her, husband, s, lead, was, not, the, independent, thinker, she, had, imagined, and, was, complicit, in, creating, an, atmosphere, where, violence, led, to, the, terror, and, her, own, execution, she, wrote, of, roland, this, woman, had, been, one, of, the, steadiest, influences, to, violence, willing, even, eager, to, use, this, terrible, revolutionary, force, so, bewildering, and, terrifying, to, me, to, accomplish, her, ends, childishly, believing, herself, and, her, friends, strong, enough, to, control, it, when, they, needed, it, no, longer, the, heaviest, blow, to, my, self, confidence, so, far, was, my, loss, of, faith, in, revolution, as, a, divine, weapon, not, since, i, discovered, the, world, not, to, have, been, made, in, six, days, had, i, been, so, intellectually, and, spiritually, upset, it, was, during, this, time, that, tarbell, received, bad, news, and, then, a, shock, franklin, tarbell, s, business, partner, had,

when, she, received, a, one, word, cablegram, that, read, safe, her, family, and, their, home, had, been, spared, tarbell, had, published, articles, with, the, syndicate, run, by, publisher, samuel,

impressed, mcclure, told, his, partner, john, s, philips, this, girl, can, write, we, need, to, get, her, to, do, some, work, for, our, magazine, the, magazine, he, was, referring, to, was, mcclure, s, magazine, a, new, venture, that, he, and, philips, were, intending, to, launch, to, appeal, to, the, average, middle, class, reader, convinced, that, tarbell, was, just, the, kind, of, writer, that, he, wanted, to, work, for, him, he, showed, up, at, tarbell, s, door, in, paris, while, on, a, scheduled, visit, to, france, in, 1892, to, offer, her, the, editor, position, at, the, new,

assumed, she, would, never, see, the, money, which, was, for, her, vacation, again, but, his, offices, wired, over, the, money, the, next, day, tarbell, initially, turned, him, down, so, she, could,

the, gardiner, green, hubbard, collection, the, articles, were, folded, into, a, book, that, would, be, a, best, seller, and, earn, tarbell, royalties, for, the, rest, of, her, life, over, 70, 000, copies, were, made, of, the, first, edition, tarbell, said, that, her, sketch, of, napoleon, turned, her, plans, topsy, turvy, because, of, its, popularity, tarbell, was, also, finally, able, to, find, a, publisher, scribner, s, for, her, madame, roland, book, another, mcclure, s, story, meant, to, compete, against, century, magazine, was, on, us, president, abraham, lincoln, on, whom, century, had, published, a, series, by, his, private, secretaries, john, nicolay, and, john, hay, at, first, tarbell, was, reluctant, to, take, up, work, on, lincoln, as, she, later, said, if, you, once, get, into, american, history, i, told, myself, you, know, well, enough, that, will, finish, france, at, the, same, time, however, tarbell, had, been, fascinated, with, lincoln, since, she, was, a, young, girl, she, remembered, the, news, of, his, assassination, and, her, parents, reaction, to, it, her, father, coming, home, from, his, shop, her, mother, burying, her, face, in, her, apron, running, into, her, room, sobbing, as, if, her, heart, would, break, when, tarbell, first, approached, john, nicolay, he, told, her, that, he, and, hay, had, written, all, that, was, worth, telling, of, lincoln, tarbell, decided, to, begin, with, lincoln, s, origins, and, his, humble, beginnings, tarbell, traveled, the, country, meeting, with, and, interviewing, people, who, had, known, lincoln, including, his, son, robert, todd, lincoln, robert, lincoln, shared, with, tarbell, an, early, and, previously, unpublished, daguerreotype, of, lincoln, as, a, younger, man, she, followed, up, on, a, lost, 1856, speech, by, lincoln, by, tracking, down, henry, clay, whitney, who, claimed, to, have, written, down, notes, and, then, confirming, his, notes, via, other, witnesses, whitney, s, version, of, the, speech, was, published, in, mcclure, s, but, has, since, been, disproved, by, other, historians, tarbell, s, research, in, the, backwoods, of, kentucky, and, illinois, uncovered, the, true, story, of, lincoln, s, childhood, and, youth, she, wrote, to, and, interviewed, hundreds, of, people, who, knew, or, had, contact, with, lincoln, she, tracked, down, leads, and, then, confirmed, their, sources, she, sent, hundreds, of, letters, looking, for, images, of, lincoln, and, found, evidence, of, more, than, three, hundred, previously, unpublished, lincoln, letters, and, speeches, tarbell, met, with, john, h, finley, while, visiting, knox, college, where, lincoln, famously, debated, stephen, douglas, in, 1858, finley, was, the, young, college, president, and, he, would, go, on, to, contribute, to, tarbell, s, work, on, standard, oil, and, rise, to, become, the, editor, of, the, new, york, times, tarbell, traveled, abroad, to, europe, discovering, that, a, rumor, that, lincoln, had, appealed, to, queen, victoria, to, not, recognize, the, confederacy, was, in, fact, false, by, december, 1895, the, popular, series, by, tarbell, once, again, helped, boost, mcclure, s, circulation, to, over, 250, 000, which, climbed, to, over, 300, 000, by, 1900, making, it, higher, than, its, rivals, this, occurred, even, as, the, editors, at, century, s, magazine, sneered, they, got, a, girl, to, write, the, life, of, lincoln, mcclure, would, go, on, to, use, the, money, generated, by, tarbell, s, articles, to, buy, a, printing, plant, and, a, bindery, it, was, at, this, time, that, tarbell, decided, to, be, a, writer, and, not, an, editor, the, articles, were, collected, in, a, book, giving, tarbell, a, national, reputation, as, a, major, writer, and, the, leading, authority, on, the, slain, president, tarbell, published, five, books, about, lincoln, and, traveled, on, the, lecture, circuit, recounting, her, discoveries, to, large, audiences, the, tight, writing, schedules, and, frequent, travel, eventually, impacted, tarbell, s, health, on, the, verge, of, physical, collapse, she, checked, into, the, clifton, springs, sanitarium, near, rochester, new, york, in, 1896, besides, rest, and, relaxation, her, treatment, included, taking, the, water, cure, she, would, visit, the, sanitarium, numerous, times, over, the, next, thirty, years, tarbell, continued, to, write, profiles, for, mcclure, in, the, late, 1890s, while, there, she, had, the, opportunity, to, observe, the, united, states, expansion, into, imperialism, through, the, spanish, american, war, she, was, writing, a, series, on, military, affairs, and, in, 1898, she, was, set, to, interview, nelson, a, miles, the, commanding, general, of, the, united, states, when, the, battleship, the, uss, maine, was, blown, up, in, havana, harbor, tarbell, was, allowed, to, keep, her, appointment, nonetheless, and, observe, the, response, at, the, u, s, army, headquarters, theodore, roosevelt, was, already, organizing, what, would, become, the, rough, riders, and, tarbell, said, that, he, kept, bursting, into, the, army, office, like, a, boy, on, roller, skates, tarbell, longed, for, her, old, life, in, paris, but, realized, she, was, needed, in, america, between, lincoln, and, the, spanish, american, war, i, realized, i, was, taking, on, a, citizenship, i, had, practically, resigned, tarbell, moved, to, new, york, and, accepted, a, position, as, desk, editor, for, mcclure, s, in, 1899, she, was, paid, 5, 000, a, year, and, given, shares, in, the, company, which, made, her, a, part, owner, she, rented, an, apartment, in, greenwich, village, which, reminded, her, of, france, she, frequented, the, hotel, brevoort, where, samuel, clemens, mark, twain, also, dined, her, position, as, editor, was, to, fill, in, for, samuel, mcclure, as, he, was, planning, to, be, away, from, the, office, for, several, months, tarbell, was, to, become, known, as, an, anchor, in, the, office, while, the, magazine, built, out, its, roster, of, investigative, editors, and, authors, she, and, phillips, were, described, as, the, control, to, s, s, mcclure, s, motor, mcclure, s, sent, stephen, crane, to, cover, cuba, during, the, war, ray, stannard, baker, was, hired, by, the, magazine, to, report, on, the, pullman, strike, fiction, editor, violo, roseboro, discovered, writers, such, as, o, henry, jack, london, and, willa, cather, john, huston, finley, quit, his, job, as, president, of, knox, college, and, became, an, editor, for, mcclure, s, by, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, mcclure, s, began, an, effort, to, expose, the, ills, of, american, society, having, recently, published, a, series, on, crime, in, america, and, looking, for, another, big, topic, to, cover, tarbell, and, the, other, editors, at, mcclure, s, decided, to, look, into, the, growth, of, trusts, steel, and, sugar, were, both, considered, before, they, settled, on, oil, there, were, a, number, of, reasons, why, the, magazine, decided, to, publish, a, story, on, standard, oil, in, particular, tarbell, s, own, first, hand, experience, with, life, in, the, pennsylvania, oil, fields, and, the, fact, that, standard, oil, was, a, trust, represented, by, only, one, person, rockefeller, and, therefore, might, make, the, story, easier, to, follow, tarbell, traveled, to, europe, and, met, with, s, s, mcclure, to, get, his, buy, in, for, the, idea, mcclure, had, been, resting, from, exhaustion, but, tarbell, s, article, idea, spurred, him, into, action, they, discussed, the, idea, over, many, days, at, a, spa, in, milan, mcclure, felt, that, tarbell, should, use, the, same, biographical, sketch, format, she, used, for, napoleon, on, her, return, to, the, states, tarbell, handed, over, the, desk, editor, role, to, lincoln, steffens, in, 1901, and, began, a, meticulous, investigation, with, the, help, of, an, assistant, john, siddall, into, how, the, industry, began, rockefeller, s, early, interest, in, oil, and, the, standard, oil, trust, tarbell, s, father, expressed, concern, to, her, about, writing, about, standard, oil, warning, her, that, rockefeller, would, stop, at, nothing, and, would, ruin, the, magazine, one, of, rockefeller, s, banks, did, indeed, threaten, the, magazine, s, financial, status, to, which, tarbell, shocked, the, bank, executive, by, replying, of, course, that, makes, no, difference, to, me, tarbell, developed, investigative, reporting, techniques, delving, into, private, archives, and, public, documents, across, the, country, the, documentation, and, oral, interviews, she, gathered, proved, standard, oil, had, used, strong, arm, tactics, and, manipulated, competitors, railroad, companies, and, others, to, reach, its, corporate, goals, organized, by, tarbell, into, a, cogent, history, they, became, a, damning, portrayal, of, big, business, and, a, personal, account, of, petty, persecution, by, rockfeller, a, subhead, on, the, cover, of, weinberg, s, book, encapsulates, it, this, way, how, a, female, investigative, journalist, brought, down, the, world, s, greatest, tycoon, and, broke, up, the, standard, oil, monopoly, tarbell, was, able, to, find, one, critical, piece, of, information, that, had, gone, missing, a, book, called, the, rise, and, fall, of, the, south, improvement, company, which, had, been, published, in, 1873, standard, oil, and, rockefeller, had, its, roots, in, the, south, improvement, company, s, illegal, schemes, standard, oil, had, attempted, to, destroy, all, available, copies, of, the, book, but, tarbell, was, finally, able, to, locate, one, copy, in, the, new, york, public, library, another, break, in, the, story, came, from, within, standard, oil, itself, and, proved, that, the, company, was, still, using, illegal, and, shady, practices, an, office, boy, working, at, the, standard, oil, headquarters, was, given, the, job, of, destroying, records, which, included, evidence, that, railroads, were, giving, the, company, advance, information, about, refiner, s, shipments, this, allowed, them, to, undercut, the, refiners, the, young, man, happened, to, notice, his, sunday, school, teacher, s, name, on, several, documents, the, teacher, was, a, refiner, and, the, young, man, took, the, papers, to, his, teacher, who, passed, them, along, to, tarbell, in, 1904, the, series, and, book, on, standard, oil, brought, tarbell, fame, the, book, was, adapted, into, a, play, in, 1905, called, the, lion, and, the, mouse, the, play, was, a, hit, even, though, ida, had, turned, down, the, lead, role, and, an, offer, of, 2, 500, in, salary, per, week, for, the, twenty, week, run, samuel, clemens, author, mark, twain, introduced, tarbell, to, henry, h, rogers, vice, president, at, standard, oil, and, considered, to, be, the, third, man, after, john, d, rockefeller, and, his, brother, william, rockefeller, rogers, had, begun, his, career, during, the, american, civil, war, in, western, pennsylvania, oil, regions, where, tarbell, had, grown, up, rockefeller, had, bought, out, rogers, and, his, partner, but, then, rogers, joined, the, trust, in, early, 1902, she, conducted, numerous, detailed, interviews, with, rogers, at, standard, oil, s, headquarters, rogers, wily, and, normally, guarded, in, matters, related, to, business, and, finance, may, have, been, under, the, impression, her, work, was, to, be, complimentary, and, was, apparently, unusually, forthcoming, even, after, the, first, articles, began, to, appear, in, mcclure, s, rogers, continued, to, speak, with, tarbell, much, to, her, surprise, her, investigative, journalism, on, standard, oil, was, serialized, in, nineteen, articles, that, ran, from, november, 1902, to, 1904, in, mcclure, s, her, first, article, being, published, with, pieces, by, lincoln, steffens, and, ray, stannard, baker, together, these, ushered, in, the, era, of, muckraking, journalism, tarbell, s, biggest, obstacle, however, was, neither, her, gender, nor, rockefeller, s, opposition, rather, her, biggest, obstacle, was, the, craft, of, journalism, as, practiced, at, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, she, investigated, standard, oil, and, rockefeller, by, using, documents, hundreds, of, thousands, of, pages, scattered, throughout, the, nation, and, then, amplified, her, findings, through, interviews, with, the, corporation, s, executives, and, competitors, government, regulators, and, academic, experts, past, and, present, in, other, words, she, proposed, to, practice, what, today, is, considered, investigative, reporting, which, did, not, exist, in, 1900, indeed, she, invented, a, new, form, of, journalism, magazine, historian, frank, luther, mott, called, it, one, of, the, greatest, serials, ever, to, appear, in, an, american, magazine, it, would, contribute, to, the, dissolution, of, standard, oil, as, a, monopoly, and, lead, to, the, clayton, antitrust, act, tarbell, concluded, the, series, with, a, two, part, character, study, of, rockefeller, perhaps, the, first, ceo, profile, ever, though, she, never, met, or, even, talked, to, him, rockefeller, called, tarbell, miss, tarbarrel, the, first, book, length, investigation, of, standard, oil, had, appeared, in, 1894, by, newspaperman, henry, demarest, lloyd, however, this, book, wealth, against, commonwealth, contained, factual, errors, and, appeared, to, be, too, accusatory, in, nature, to, garner, popular, acclaim, however, tarbell, s, articles, when, collected, in, the, book, the, history, of, the, standard, oil, company, 1904, became, a, bestseller, which, was, called, a, masterpiece, of, investigative, journalism, by, author, and, historian, j, north, conway, her, articles, and, the, book, would, lead, to, the, passage, of, the, hepburn, act, in, 1906, to, oversee, the, railroads, the, 1910, mann, elkins, act, which, gave, the, interstate, commerce, commission, power, over, oil, rates, and, the, creation, of, the, federal, trade, commission, ftc, in, 1914, president, theodore, roosevelt, gave, tarbell, and, her, peers, including, lincoln, steffens, and, ray, stannard, baker, the, label, muckrakers, tarbell, s, expos, of, standard, oil, first, appeared, in, the, january, 1903, issue, of, mcclure, s, along, with, steffens, investigation, of, political, corruption, in, minneapolis, and, baker, s, expos, on, labor, union, practices, the, term, muckraker, came, from, john, bunyan, s, pilgrim, s, progress, describing, a, man, with, a, muckrake, forever, clearing, muck, from, the, floor, roosevelt, said, of, the, muckrakers, the, man, who, never, does, anything, else, who, never, thinks, or, speaks, or, writes, save, of, his, feats, with, the, muckrake, speedily, becomes, not, a, help, to, society, not, an, incitement, to, good, but, one, of, the, most, potent, forces, of, evil, tarbell, disliked, the, muckraker, label, and, wrote, an, article, muckraker, or, historian, in, which, she, justified, her, efforts, for, exposing, the, oil, trust, she, referred, to, this, classification, of, muckraker, which, i, did, not, like, all, the, radical, element, and, i, numbered, many, friends, among, them, were, begging, me, to, join, their, movements, i, soon, found, that, most, of, them, wanted, attacks, they, had, little, interest, in, balanced, findings, now, i, was, convinced, that, in, the, long, run, the, public, they, were, trying, to, stir, would, weary, of, vituperation, that, if, you, were, to, secure, permanent, results, the, mind, must, be, convinced, tarbell, had, written, for, mcclure, s, from, 1894, until, 1906, by, then, s, s, mcclure, had, become, an, increasingly, absentee, publisher, occasionally, dropping, in, to, override, ideas, and, tarbell, s, orders, she, had, lost, her, father, the, previous, year, to, gastric, cancer, and, s, s, mcclure, s, erratic, behavior, at, the, magazine, contributed, to, her, stress, as, it, threatened, the, stability, of, the, magazine, and, tarbell, s, holdings, this, led, tarbell, and, john, phillips, to, both, resign, from, mcclure, s, in, june, 1906, followed, by, baker, steffens, and, siddall, tarbell, and, philips, raised, money, to, form, the, phillips, publishing, company, and, to, purchase, the, american, illustrated, magazine, formerly, leslie, s, monthly, magazine, which, they, renamed, the, american, magazine, phillips, became, president, tarbell, became, its, associate, editor, and, remained, there, until, 1915, instead, of, focusing, on, muckraking, journalism, the, magazine, steered, away, from, reporting, what, was, wrong, in, society, and, focused, on, what, was, right, as, well, as, the, establishing, the, new, magazine, in, 1906, tarbell, moved, to, connecticut, and, purchased, a, 40, acre, farm, in, redding, ridge, connecticut, which, she, named, twin, oaks, after, tarbell, bought, her, farm, in, 1906, her, household, expanded, to, include, a, number, of, family, members, tarbell, resided, with, her, sister, sarah, in, easton, connecticut, at, rock, house, and, valley, roads, over, the, years, several, other, family, members, also, lived, on, the, property, including, her, niece, and, nephew, clara, and, tristram, tripper, who, lived, in, a, cottage, tarbell, s, brother, walter, and, his, wife, also, came, to, live, there, after, walter, suffered, an, emotional, breakdown, mark, twain, and, other, new, york, publishing, people, lived, nearby, and, tarbell, frequently, entertained, friends, there, tarbell, wrote, of, the, work, required, on, a, farm, things, happened, the, roof, leaked, the, grass, must, be, cut, if, i, was, to, have, a, comfortable, sward, to, sit, on, water, in, the, house, was, imperative, and, what, i, had, not, reckoned, with, came, from, all, the, corners, of, my, land, incessant, calls, fields, calling, to, be, rid, of, underbrush, and, weeds, and, turned, to, their, proper, work, a, garden, spot, calling, for, a, chance, to, show, what, it, could, do, apple, trees, begging, to, be, trimmed, and, sprayed, i, had, bought, an, abandoned, farm, and, it, cried, loud, to, go, about, its, business, tarbell, wrote, a, series, of, essential, articles, at, the, american, magazine, in, which, she, investigated, tariffs, and, their, impact, on, american, businesses, and, consumers, tarbell, also, traveled, to, chicago, to, investigate, their, public, transportation, she, met, jane, addams, and, stayed, at, hull, house, in, 1908, there, she, participated, in, the, group, s, programs, which, included, teaching, immigrant, women, english, job, and, homemaking, skills, tarbell, and, the, other, editors, decided, to, sell, the, american, magazine, to, the, crowell, publishing, company, in, 1911, john, phillips, sold, his, remaining, interests, to, crowell, publishing, company, in, 1915, phillips, became, a, consultant, to, the, magazine, john, siddell, became, the, editor, and, tarbell, turned, to, freelance, writing, tarbell, examined, the, positive, side, of, american, business, in, a, series, of, articles, written, between, 1912, and, 1916, she, toured, the, united, states, and, met, with, factory, owners, and, workers, and, their, families, tarbell, said, of, her, own, muckraking, reputation, was, it, not, the, duty, of, those, who, were, called, muckrakers, to, rake, up, the, good, earth, as, well, as, the, noxious, she, was, fascinated, by, thomas, lynch, of, the, frick, coke, company, who, was, committed, to, providing, decent, living, conditions, for, his, workers, and, believed, that, safety, first, was, preferable, to, accidents, tarbell, also, admired, and, wrote, about, ford, motor, company, founder, henry, ford, and, his, belief, that, offering, high, pay, would, create, excellent, work, as, well, as, his, ideas, around, mass, production, steve, weinberg, wrote, that, ida, tarbell, was, a, feminist, by, example, but, not, by, ideology, feminist, scholars, viewed, tarbell, as, an, enigma, as, she, seemed, to, both, embrace, the, movement, and, act, as, a, critic, while, her, accomplishments, were, many, tarbell, also, challenged, and, questioned, the, logic, of, women, s, suffrage, early, in, life, tarbell, was, exposed, to, the, suffragette, movement, when, her, mother, hosted, meetings, in, their, home, tarbell, was, put, off, by, women, such, as, mary, livermore, and, frances, willard, who, she, said, never, paid, attention, to, her, by, contrast, tarbell, noted, the, men, her, father, hosted, showed, interest, in, her, tarbell, did, say, that, the, movement, sparked, in, her, a, desire, to, attend, college, and, receive, an, education, starting, in, 1909, tarbell, wrote, more, about, women, and, traditional, roles, tarbell, was, alienated, by, the, more, militant, aspects, of, the, movement, and, described, it, as, anti, male, she, recommended, that, women, embrace, home, life, and, the, family, saying, they, had, a, true, role, as, wives, mothers, and, homemakers, one, biographer, emily, arnold, mccully, believed, that, her, stance, on, women, s, issues, may, have, tarnished, her, long, term, legacy, tarbell, felt, that, the, drive, for, suffrage, was, a, misguided, war, on, men, former, allies, among, suffragists, were, dismayed, at, her, change, and, her, speaking, to, anti, suffragist, organizations, tarbell, published, the, article, making, a, man, of, herself, in, the, american, magazine, in, 1912, which, infuriated, her, readers, and, activists, historian, robert, stinson, believed, that, she, was, making, new, public, statements, about, the, ambiguity, she, had, lived, in, her, own, life, which, defined, women, s, roles, based, upon, their, nature, and, saw, attempts, to, push, the, boundaries, into, men, s, realms, as, unnatural, mccully, supposed, that, suffrage, was, a, human, s, rights, issue, seemed, not, to, occur, to, her, perhaps, because, as, a, historian, she, was, much, better, looking, backward, than, she, was, at, anticipating, the, future, tarbell, collected, her, essays, on, women, and, published, them, in, a, book, called, the, business, of, being, a, woman, the, book, which, was, poorly, received, contained, tributes, to, early, supporters, of, women, including, susan, b, anthony, and, elizabeth, cady, stanton, tarbell, said, of, the, book, that, title, was, like, a, red, rag, to, many, of, my, militant, friends, the, idea, that, woman, had, a, business, assigned, by, nature, and, society, which, was, of, more, importance, than, public, life, disturbed, them, even, if, it, was, so, they, did, not, want, it, emphasized, even, tarbell, s, own, mother, esther, who, was, a, lifelong, suffragette, criticized, ida, s, position, tarbell, switched, course, and, embraced, suffrage, after, american, women, won, the, right, to, vote, in, 1920, she, wrote, an, article, for, good, housekeeping, in, 1924, to, dispel, the, myth, that, suffrage, had, failed, she, wrote, twenty, million, women, did, vote, and, should, vote, when, asked, if, she, believed, that, a, woman, would, one, day, be, president, of, the, united, states, tarbell, pointed, out, that, women, had, ruled, nations, in, some, cases, better, than, kings, and, pointed, to, examples, of, catherine, the, great, of, russia, louise, of, mecklenburg, strelitz, of, prussia, elizabeth, i, of, england, and, catherine, de, medici, of, france, tarbell, worked, to, help, women, who, had, no, choice, but, to, work, often, under, horrifying, conditions, she, wrote, about, workplace, safety, and, covered, the, realities, of, factories, where, women, worked, she, became, an, advocate, for, taylorism, a, system, for, scientific, management, of, production, encouraging, its, use, in, home, economics, she, became, a, member, of, the, taylor, society, she, visited, more, than, fifty, five, businesses, for, the, article, the, golden, rule, of, business, to, see, how, scientific, management, and, christian, values, worked, together, she, decided, it, was, the, best, way, to, protect, workers, and, at, the, same, time, maximize, profits, tarbell, was, a, founding, member, of, the, authors, league, in, 1914, a, collective, to, support, working, writers, which, later, became, the, authors, guild, tarbell, s, career, shifted, in, 1915, when, american, magazine, named, john, siddall, as, editor, tarbell, joined, the, chautauqua, science, and, literary, circuit, a, lecture, and, entertainment, tour, filled, with, public, speakers, singers, and, other, acts, such, as, trained, dogs, and, yodelers, before, the, tour, tarbell, trained, for, public, speaking, with, frank,
