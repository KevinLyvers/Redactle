the, position, of, the, jewish, bund, which, had, co, founded, the, russian, social, democratic, labour, party, rsdlp, in, 1898, but, wanted, to, remain, autonomous, within, the, party, shortly, afterwards, the, pro, iskra, delegates, unexpectedly, split, into, two, factions, the, split, was, initially, over, an, organisational, issue, lenin, and, his, supporters, the, bolsheviks, argued, for, a, smaller, but, highly, organized, party, where, only, party, members, would, be, seen, as, members, while, martov, and, his, supporters, the, mensheviks, argued, for, a, bigger, and, less, disciplined, party, where, people, who, assisted, would, also, be, seen, as, members, in, a, surprise, development, trotsky, and, most, of, the, iskra, editors, supported, martov, and, the, mensheviks, while, plekhanov, supported, lenin, and, the, bolsheviks, during, 1903, and, 1904, many, members, changed, sides, in, the, factions, trotsky, left, the, mensheviks, in, september, 1904,

himself, as, a, non, factional, social, democrat, he, tried, to, reconcile, different, groups, within, the, party, which, resulted, in, many, clashes, with, lenin, and, other, prominent, party, members, trotsky, later, maintained, that, he, had, been, wrong, in, opposing, lenin, on, the, issue, of, the, party, trotsky, began, developing, his, theory, of, permanent, revolution, and, developed, a, close, working, relationship, with, alexander, parvus, in, 1904, 07, during, their, split, lenin, referred, to, trotsky, as, little, judas, iudushka, based, on, the, character, from,

menshevik, leader, bitterly, denouncing, lenin, and, the, bolsheviks, though, he, quickly, got, over, the, disagreement, the, message, was, intercepted, by, the, russian, secret, police, and, a, copy, was, put, into, their, archives, shortly, after, lenin, s, death, in, 1924, the, letter, was, found, and, publicized, by, trotsky, s, opponents, within, the, communist, party, to, portray, him, as, lenin, s, enemy, the, 1910s, were, a, period, of, heightened, tension, within, the, rsdlp, leading, to, numerous, frictions, between, trotsky, the, bolsheviks, and, the, mensheviks, the, most, serious, disagreement, that, trotsky, and, the, mensheviks, had, with, lenin, at, the, time, was, over, the, issue, of, expropriations, i, e, armed, robbery, of, banks, and, other, companies, by, bolshevik, groups, to, procure, money, for, the, party, these, actions, had, been, banned, by, the, 5th, congress, but, were, continued, by, the, bolsheviks, in, january, 1912, the, majority, of, the, bolshevik, faction, led, by, lenin, as, well, as, a, few, defecting, mensheviks, held, a, conference, in, prague, and, decided, to, break, away, from, the, russian, social, democratic, labour, party, and, formed, a, new, party, the, russian, social, democratic, labour, party, bolsheviks, in, response, trotsky, organized, a, unification, conference, of, social, democratic, factions, in, vienna, in, august, 1912, a, k, a, the, august, bloc, and, tried, to, re, unite, the, bolsheviks, and, mensheviks, into, one, party, the, attempt, was, generally, unsuccessful, in, vienna, trotsky, continuously, published, articles, in, radical, russian, and, ukrainian, newspapers, such, as, kievskaya, mysl, under, a, variety, of, pseudonyms, often, using, antid, oto, a, name, chosen, at, random, from, an, italian, dictionary, with, trotsky, joking, that, wanted, to, inject, the, marxist, antidote, into, the, legitimate, newspapers, in, september, 1912, kievskaya, mysl, sent, him, to, the, balkans, as, its, war, correspondent, where, he, covered, the, two, balkan, wars, for, the, next, year, while, there, trotsky, chronicled, the, ethnic, cleansing, carried, out, by, the, serbian, army, against, the, albanian, civilian, population, he, became, a, close, friend, of, christian, rakovsky, later, a, leading, soviet, politician, and, trotsky, s, ally, in, the, soviet, communist, party, on, 3, august, 1914, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, which, austria, hungary, fought, against, the, russian, empire, trotsky, was, forced, to, flee, vienna, for, neutral, switzerland, to, avoid, arrest, as, a, russian, migr, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, caused, a, sudden, realignment, within, the, rsdlp, and, other, european, social, democratic, parties, over, the, issues, of, war, revolution, pacifism, and, internationalism, redividing, the, party, into, defeatists, and, defencists, within, the, rsdlp, lenin, trotsky, and, martov, advocated, various, internationalist, anti, war, positions, that, saw, defeat, for, your, own, country, s, ruling, class, imperialists, as, the, lesser, evil, in, the, war, while, they, opposed, all, imperialists, in, the, imperialist, war, these, anti, war, believers, were, known, as, defeatists, those, who, supported, one, side, over, the, other, in, the, war, were, known, as, defencists, plekhanov, and, many, other, defencist, social, democrats, both, bolsheviks, and, mensheviks, supported, the, russian, government, to, some, extent, and, wanted, them, to, win, the, war, while, trotsky, s, ex, colleague, parvus, now, a, defencist, sided, against, russia, so, strongly, that, he, wanted, germany, to, win, the, war, in, switzerland, trotsky, briefly, worked, within, the, swiss, socialist, party, prompting, it, to, adopt, an, internationalist, resolution, he, wrote, a, book, opposing, the, war, the, war, and, the, international, and, the, pro, war, position, taken, by, the, european, social, democratic, parties, primarily, the, german, party, as, a, war, correspondent, for, the, kievskaya, mysl, trotsky, moved, to, france, on, 19, november, 1914, in, january, 1915, in, paris, he, began, editing, at, first, with, martov,

annexations, peace, without, conquerors, or, conquered, lenin, advocated, russia, s, defeat, in, the, war, and, demanded, a, complete, break, with, the, second, international, trotsky, attended, the, zimmerwald, conference, of, anti, war, socialists, in, september, 1915, and, advocated, a, middle, course, between, those, who, like, martov, would, stay, within, the, second, international, at, any, cost, and, those, who, like, lenin, would, break, with, the, second, international, and, form, a, third, international, the, conference, adopted, the, middle, line, proposed, by, trotsky, at, first, opposed, in, the, end, lenin, voted, for, trotsky, s, resolution, to, avoid, a, split, among, anti, war, socialists, in, september, 1916, trotsky, was, deported, from, france, to, spain, for, his, anti, war, activities, spanish, authorities, did, not, want, him, and, deported, him, to, the, united, states, on, 25, december, 1916, he, arrived, in, new, york, city, on, 13, january, 1917, he,

the, abdication, of, tsar, nicholas, ii, he, left, new, york, on, 27, march, 1917, but, his, ship, the, ss, kristianiafjord, was, intercepted, by, british, naval, officials, in, canada, at, halifax, nova, scotia, he, was, detained, for, a, month, at, amherst, internment, camp, in, nova, scotia, while, imprisoned, in, the, camp, trotsky, established, an, increasing, friendship, with, the, workers, and, sailors, amongst, his, fellow, inmates, describing, his, month, at, the, camp, as, one, continual, mass, meeting, trotsky, s, speeches, and, agitation, incurred, the, wrath, of, german, officer, inmates, who, complained, to, the, british, camp, commander, colonel, morris, about, trotsky, s, anti, patriotic, attitude, morris, then, forbade, trotsky, to, make, any, more, public, speeches, leading, to, 530, prisoners, protesting, and, signing, a, petition, against, morris, order, back, in, russia, after, initial, hesitation, and, facing, pressure, from, the, workers, and, peasants, soviets, the, russian, foreign, minister, pavel, milyukov, was, compelled, to, demand, the, release, of, trotsky, as, a, russian, citizen, and, the, british, government, freed, him, on, 29, april, 1917, he, reached, russia, on, 17, may, 1917, after, his, return, trotsky, substantially, agreed, with, the, bolshevik, position, but, did, not, join, them, right, away, russian, social, democrats, were, split, into, at, least, six, groups, and, the, bolsheviks, were, waiting, for, the, next, party, congress, to, determine, which, factions, to, merge, with, trotsky, temporarily, joined, the, mezhraiontsy, a, regional, social, democratic, organization, in, petrograd, and, became, one, of, its, leaders, at, the, first, congress, of, soviets, in, june, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, first, all, russian, central, executive, committee, vtsik, from, the, mezhraiontsy, faction, after, an, unsuccessful, pro, bolshevik, uprising, in, petrograd, trotsky, was, arrested, on, 7, august, 1917, he, was, released, 40, days, later, in, the, aftermath, of, the, failed, counter, revolutionary, uprising, by, lavr, kornilov, after, the, bolsheviks, gained, a, majority, in, the, petrograd, soviet, trotsky, was, elected, chairman, on, 8, october, 1917, trotsky, sided, with, lenin, against, grigory, zinoviev, and, lev, kamenev, when, the, bolshevik, central, committee, discussed, staging, an, armed, uprising, and, he, led, the, efforts, to, overthrow, the, russian, provisional, government, headed, by, socialist, aleksandr, kerensky, the, following, summary, of, trotsky, s, role, in, 1917, was, written, by, joseph, stalin, in, pravda, 6, november, 1918, although, this, passage, was, quoted, in, stalin, s, book, the, october, revolution, 1934, it, was, expunged, from, stalin, s, works, 1949, all, practical, work, in, connection, with, the, organization, of, the, uprising, was, done, under, the, immediate, direction, of, comrade, trotsky, the, president, of, the, petrograd, soviet, it, can, be, stated, with, certainty, that, the, party, is, indebted, primarily, and, principally, to, comrade, trotsky, for, the, rapid, going, over, of, the, garrison, to, the, side, of, the, soviet, and, the, efficient, manner, in, which, the, work, of, the, military, revolutionary, committee, was, organized, after, the, success, of, the, october, revolution, on, 7, 8, november, 1917, trotsky, led, the, efforts, to, repel, a, counter, attack, by, cossacks, under, general, pyotr, krasnov, and, other, troops, still, loyal, to, the, overthrown, provisional, government, at, gatchina, allied, with, lenin, he, defeated, attempts, by, other, bolshevik, central, committee, members, zinoviev, kamenev, rykov, etc, to, share, power, with, other, moderate, socialist, parties, trotsky, was, an, outspoken, advocate, for, a, predominantly, bolshevik, government, and, was, reluctant, to, recall, mensheviks, as, partners, after, their, voluntary, withdrawal, from, the, congress, of, the, soviets, however, he, released, several, socialist, ministers, from, prison, and, neither, trotsky, nor, his, colleagues, in, 1917, wished, to, suppress, these, parties, the, bolsheviks, also, reserved, a, number, of, vacant, seats, in, the, soviets, and, central, executive, for, the, parties, in, proportion, to, their, vote, share, at, the, congress, at, the, same, time, a, number, of, prominent, members, of, the, left, socialist, revolutionaries, had, assumed, positions, in, lenin, s, government, and, lead, commissariats, in, several, areas, this, included, agriculture, kolegaev, property, karelin, justice, steinberg, post, offices, and, telegraphs, proshian, and, local, government, trutovsky, according, to, deutscher, the, mensheviks, and, social, revolutionaries, presented, a, number, of, demands, for, a, coalition, government, these, demands, proposed, disarming, the, bolshevik, detachments, and, excluding, lenin, and, trotsky, from, the, coalition, this, was, seen, as, unacceptable, to, even, the, most, moderate, bolshevik, negotiators, such, as, kamenev, and, sokolnikov, by, the, end, of, 1917, trotsky, was, unquestionably, the, second, man, in, the, bolshevik, party, after, lenin, he, overshadowed, zinoviev, who, had, been, lenin, s, top, lieutenant, over, the, previous, decade, after, the, bolsheviks, came, to, power, trotsky, became, the, people, s, commissar, for, foreign, affairs, and, published, the, secret, treaties, previously, signed, by, the, triple, entente, that, detailed, plans, for, post, war, reallocation, of, colonies, and, redrawing, state, borders, on, 23, november, 1917, trotsky, revealed, the, secret, treaty, arrangements, which, had, been, made, between, the, tsarist, government, britain, and, france, causing, them, considerable, embarrassment, in, preparation, for, peace, talks, with, the, representatives, of, the, imperial, german, government, and, the, representatives, of, the, other, central, powers, leading, up, to, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, leon, trotsky, appointed, his, old, friend, joffe, to, represent, the, bolsheviks, when, the, soviet, delegation, learned, that, germans, and, austro, hungarians, planned, to, annex, slices, of, polish, territory, and, to, set, up, a, rump, polish, state, with, what, remained, while, the, baltic, provinces, were, to, become, client, states, ruled, by, german, princes, the, talks, were, recessed, for, 12, days, the, soviets, only, hopes, were, that, given, time, their, allies, would, agree, to, join, the, negotiations, or, that, the, western, european, proletariat, would, revolt, so, their, best, strategy, was, to, prolong, the, negotiations, as, foreign, minister, leon, trotsky, wrote, to, delay, negotiations, there, must, be, someone, to, do, the, delaying, therefore, trotsky, replaced, joffe, as, the, leader, of, the, soviet, delegation, during, the, peace, negotiations, in, brest, litovsk, from, 22, december, 1917, to, 10, february, 1918, at, that, time, the, soviet, government, was, split, on, the, issue, left, communists, led, by, nikolai, bukharin, continued, to, believe, that, there, could, be, no, peace, between, a, soviet, republic, and, a, capitalist, empire, and, that, only, a, revolutionary, war, leading, to, a, pan, european, soviet, republic, would, bring, a, durable, peace, they, cited, the, successes, of, the, newly, formed, 15, january, 1918, voluntary, red, army, against, polish, forces, of, gen, j, zef, dowbor, mu, nicki, in, belarus, white, forces, in, the, don, region, and, newly, independent, ukrainian, forces, as, proof, that, the, red, army, could, repel, german, forces, especially, if, propaganda, and, asymmetrical, warfare, were, used, they, were, willing, to, hold, talks, with, the, germans, as, a, means, of, exposing, german, imperial, ambitions, territorial, gains, reparations, etc, in, the, hope, of, accelerating, the, hoped, for, soviet, revolution, in, the, west, still, they, were, dead, set, against, signing, any, peace, treaty, in, the, case, of, a, german, ultimatum, they, advocated, proclaiming, a, revolutionary, war, against, germany, to, inspire, russian, and, european, workers, to, fight, for, socialism, this, opinion, was, shared, by, left, socialist, revolutionaries, who, were, then, the, bolsheviks, junior, partners, in, a, coalition, government, lenin, who, had, earlier, hoped, for, a, speedy, soviet, revolution, in, germany, and, other, parts, of, europe, quickly, decided, that, the, imperial, government, of, germany, was, still, firmly, in, control, and, that, without, a, strong, russian, military, an, armed, conflict, with, germany, would, lead, to, a, collapse, of, the, soviet, government, in, russia, he, agreed, with, the, left, communists, that, ultimately, a, pan, european, soviet, revolution, would, solve, all, problems, but, until, then, the, bolsheviks, had, to, stay, in, power, lenin, did, not, mind, prolonging, the, negotiating, process, for, maximum, propaganda, effect, but, from, january, 1918, on, advocated, signing, a, separate, peace, treaty, if, faced, with, a, german, ultimatum, trotsky, s, position, was, between, these, two, bolshevik, factions, like, lenin, he, admitted, that, the, old, russian, military, inherited, from, the, monarchy, and, the, provisional, government, and, in, advanced, stages, of, decomposition, was, unable, to, fight, that, we, could, no, longer, fight, was, perfectly, clear, to, me, and, that, the, newly, formed, red, guard, and, red, army, detachments, were, too, small, and, poorly, trained, to, resist, the, germans, but, he, agreed, with, the, left, communists, that, a, separate, peace, treaty, with, an, imperialist, power, would, be, a, terrible, morale, and, material, blow, to, the, soviet, government, negate, all, its, military, and, political, successes, of, 1917, and, 1918, resurrect, the, notion, that, the, bolsheviks, secretly, allied, with, the, german, government, and, cause, an, upsurge, of, internal, resistance, he, argued, that, any, german, ultimatum, should, be, refused, and, that, this, might, well, lead, to, an, uprising, in, germany, or, at, least, inspire, german, soldiers, to, disobey, their, officers, since, any, german, offensive, would, be, a, naked, land, grab, for, territories, trotsky, wrote, in, 1925, we, began, peace, negotiations, in, the, hope, of, arousing, the, workmen, s, party, of, germany, and, austria, hungary, as, well, as, of, the, entente, countries, for, this, reason, we, were, obliged, to, delay, the, negotiations, as, long, as, possible, to, give, the, european, workman, time, to, understand, the, main, fact, of, the, soviet, revolution, itself, and, particularly, its, peace, policy, but, there, was, the, other, question, can, the, germans, still, fight, are, they, in, a, position, to, begin, an, attack, on, the, revolution, that, will, explain, the, cessation, of, the, war, how, can, we, find, out, the, state, of, mind, of, the, german, soldiers, how, to, fathom, it, trotsky, in, a, letter, he, wrote, to, lenin, during, the, negotiations, which, must, have, been, written, before, january, 18, 1918, described, its, policy, summarily, as, follows, dear, vladimir, ilyich, it, is, impossible, to, sign, their, peace, they, already, have, agreed, with, fictitious, governments, of, poland, lithuania, courland, and, others, concerning, territorial, concessions, and, military, and, customs, treaties, we, cannot, sign, their, peace, my, plan, is, this, we, announce, the, termination, of, the, war, and, demobilization, without, signing, any, peace, we, declare, we, cannot, participate, in, the, looting, war, of, the, allies, nor, can, we, sign, a, looting, peace, poland, s, lithuania, s, and, courland, s, fate, we, place, upon, the, responsibility, of, the, german, working, people, the, germans, will, be, unable, to, attack, us, after, we, declare, the, war, ended, at, any, rate, it, would, be, very, difficult, for, germany, to, attack, us, because, of, her, internal, condition, the, scheidemannites, adopted, a, formal, resolution, to, break, with, the, government, if, it, makes, annexationist, demands, of, the, russian, revolution, the, berliner, tageblatt, and, the, vossische, zeitung, demand, an, understanding, with, russia, by, all, means, the, centrists, favor, an, agreement, we, declare, we, end, the, war, but, do, not, sign, a, peace, they, will, be, unable, to, make, an, offensive, against, us, if, they, attack, us, our, position, will, be, no, worse, than, now, we, must, have, your, decision, we, can, still, drag, on, negotiations, for, one, or, two, or, three, or, four, days, afterward, they, must, be, broken, off, i, see, no, other, solution, than, that, proposed, i, clasp, your, hand, yours, trotzky, answer, by, direct, wire, i, agree, to, your, plan, or, i, don, t, agree, however, even, though, lenin, was, in, favor, of, a, peace, due, to, party, opposition, he, responded, with, these, messages, from, january, 18, 1918, stalin, has, just, arrived, we, will, look, into, the, matter, with, him, and, let, you, have, a, joint, answer, right, away, and, please, adjourn, proceedings, and, leave, for, petrograd, send, a, reply, i, will, wait, lenin, stalin, as, it, was, remarked, by, trotsky, that, ossibly, this, answer, already, showed, that, he, did, not, agree, with, my, proposition, trotsky, returned, to, petrograd, to, debate, with, lenin, during, his, debate, with, trotsky, lenin, concluded, in, any, case, i, stand, for, the, immediate, signing, of, peace, it, is, safer, however, after, debates, with, the, german, delegation, trotsky, and, the, russian, delegation, withdrew, from, peace, talks, on, 10, february, 1918, by, declaring, ending, the, war, on, the, side, of, soviet, russia, and, not, signing, a, peace, treaty, privately, in, correspondence, with, count, otto, von, czernin, trotsky, had, expressed, his, willigness, to, relent, to, peace, terms, upon, the, resumption, of, a, german, offensive, although, with, moral, dissent, contrary, to, russia, s, declaration, germany, resumed, military, operations, on, 18, february, within, a, day, it, became, clear, that, the, german, army, was, capable, of, conducting, offensive, operations, and, that, red, army, detachments, which, were, relatively, small, poorly, organized, and, poorly, led, were, no, match, for, it, on, the, evening, of, 18, february, 1918, trotsky, and, his, supporters, in, the, committee, abstained, and, lenin, s, proposal, was, accepted, 7, 4, the, soviet, government, sent, a, radiogram, to, the, german, side, taking, the, final, brest, litovsk, peace, terms, germany, did, not, respond, for, three, days, and, continued, its, offensive, encountering, little, resistance, the, response, arrived, on, 21, february, but, the, proposed, terms, were, so, harsh, that, even, lenin, briefly, thought, that, the, soviet, government, had, no, choice, but, to, fight, but, in, the, end, the, committee, again, voted, 7, 4, on, 23, february, 1918, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, was, signed, on, 3, march, and, ratified, on, 15, march, 1918, since, trotsky, was, so, closely, associated, with, the, policy, previously, followed, by, the, soviet, delegation, at, brest, litovsk, he, resigned, from, his, position, as, commissar, for, foreign, affairs, to, remove, a, potential, obstacle, to, the, new, policy, on, 13, march, 1918, trotsky, s, resignation, as, commissar, for, foreign, affairs, was, officially, accepted, and, he, was, appointed, people, s, commissar, of, army, and, navy, affairs, in, place, of, podvoisky, and, chairman, of, the, supreme, military, council, the, post, of, commander, in, chief, was, abolished, and, trotsky, gained, full, control, of, the, red, army, responsible, only, to, the, communist, party, leadership, whose, left, socialist, revolutionary, allies, had, left, the, government, over, the, controversial, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, the, entire, bolshevik, leadership, of, the, red, army, including, people, s, commissar, defence, minister, nikolai, podvoisky, and, commander, in, chief, nikolai, krylenko, protested, vigorously, against, trotsky, s, appointment, and, eventually, resigned, they, believed, that, the, red, army, should, consist, only, of, dedicated, revolutionaries, rely, on, propaganda, and, force, and, have, elected, officers, they, viewed, former, imperial, officers, and, generals, as, potential, traitors, who, should, be, kept, out, of, the, new, military, much, less, put, in, charge, of, it, their, views, continued, to, be, popular, with, many, bolsheviks, throughout, most, of, the, russian, civil, war, and, their, supporters, including, podvoisky, who, became, one, of, trotsky, s, deputies, were, a, constant, thorn, in, trotsky, s, side, the, discontent, with, trotsky, s, policies, of, strict, discipline, forced, conscription, and, reliance, on, carefully, supervised, non, communist, military, experts, eventually, led, to, the, military, opposition, which, was, active, within, the, communist, party, in, late, 1918, 1919, the, military, situation, soon, tested, trotsky, s, managerial, and, organization, building, skills, in, may, june, 1918, the, czechoslovak, legions, en, route, from, european, russia, to, vladivostok, rose, against, the, soviet, government, this, left, the, bolsheviks, with, the, loss, of, most, of, the, country, s, territory, an, increasingly, well, organized, resistance, by, russian, anti, communist, forces, usually, referred, to, as, the, white, army, after, their, best, known, component, and, widespread, defection, by, the, military, experts, whom, trotsky, relied, on, trotsky, and, the, government, responded, with, a, full, fledged, mobilization, which, increased, the, size, of, the, red, army, from, fewer, than, 300, 000, in, may, 1918, to, one, million, in, october, and, an, introduction, of, political, commissars, into, the, army, the, latter, had, the, task, of, ensuring, the, loyalty, of, military, experts, mostly, former, officers, in, the, imperial, army, and, co, signing, their, orders, trotsky, regarded, the, organisation, of, the, red, army, as, built, on, the, ideas, of, the, october, revolution, as, he, later, wrote, in, his, autobiography, an, army, cannot, be, built, without, reprisals, masses, of, men, cannot, be, led, to, death, unless, the, army, command, has, the, death, penalty, in, its, arsenal, so, long, as, those, malicious, tailless, apes, that, are, so, proud, of, their, technical, achievements, the, animals, that, we, call, men, will, build, armies, and, wage, wars, the, command, will, always, be, obliged, to, place, the, soldiers, between, the, possible, death, in, the, front, and, the, inevitable, one, in, the, rear, and, yet, armies, are, not, built, on, fear, the, tsar, s, army, fell, to, pieces, not, because, of, any, lack, of, reprisals, in, his, attempt, to, save, it, by, restoring, the, death, penalty, kerensky, only, finished, it, upon, the, ashes, of, the, great, war, the, bolsheviks, created, a, new, army, these, facts, demand, no, explanation, for, any, one, who, has, even, the, slightest, knowledge, of, the, language, of, history, the, strongest, cement, in, the, new, army, was, the, ideas, of, the, october, revolution, and, the, train, supplied, the, front, with, this, cement, another, controversial, feature, of, his, military, decisions, was, to, inaugurate, hostage, taking, of, relatives, of, ex, tsarist, officials, working, in, the, red, army, to, avert, the, risk, of, defection, or, betrayal, service, pointed, out, that, this, practice, was, exercised, by, both, red, and, white, armies, during, the, civil, war, trotsky, would, later, defend, his, decision, and, argue, that, none, of, the, families, of, ex, officials, who, did, betray, the, army, and, contribute, to, additional, human, casualties, were, themselves, ever, executed, he, would, also, insist, that, had, these, draconian, measures, been, adopted, rather, than, excess, magnanimity, to, opponents, at, the, start, of, the, october, revolution, then, russia, would, have, experienced, far, less, casualties, deutscher, draws, attention, to, the, fact, that, trotsky, preferred, to, exchange, hostages, and, prisoners, rather, than, execute, them, he, recounts, that, trotsky, had, released, general, krasnov, on, parole, in, 1918, after, the, kerensky, krasnov, uprising, during, the, initial, stage, of, the, civil, war, but, the, general, would, take, up, arms, against, the, soviets, shortly, again, afterwards, arising, after, assassination, attempts, on, lenin, and, trotsky, along, with, the, successful, assassinations, of, petrograd, cheka, leader, moisei, uritsky, and, party, editor, v, volodarsky, the, red, terror, was, enacted, the, french, reign, of, terror, has, been, viewed, as, an, influence, and, a, model, for, the, civil, war, repressions, the, decision, to, enact, the, red, terror, was, also, driven, by, initial, white, army, massacres, of, red, prisoners, in, 1917, allied, intervention, in, the, russian, civil, war, and, the, large, scale, massacres, of, reds, during, the, finnish, civil, war, in, which, 10, 000, 20, 000, workers, had, been, liquidated, by, the, finnish, whites, in, his, book, terrorism, and, communism, trotsky, argued, that, the, reign, of, terror, in, russia, began, with, the, white, terror, under, the, white, guard, forces, and, the, bolsheviks, responded, with, the, red, terror, felix, dzerzhinsky, was, tasked, with, rooting, out, counter, revolutionary, threats, and, appointed, director, of, the, all, russian, extraordinary, commission, aka, cheka, a, predecessor, of, the, kgb, that, served, as, the, secret, police, from, early, 1918, the, bolsheviks, started, physical, elimination, of, opposition, and, other, socialist, and, revolutionary, fractions, anarchists, among, the, first, on, 11, august, 1918, prior, to, the, events, that, would, officially, catalyze, the, terror, lenin, sent, telegrams, to, introduce, mass, terror, in, nizhny, novgorod, in, response, to, a, suspected, civilian, uprising, and, to, crush, landowners, who, resisted, sometimes, violently, the, requisitioning, of, their, grain, by, military, detachments, on, august, 30, socialist, revolutionary, fanny, kaplan, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, assassinate, vladimir, lenin, in, september, trotsky, rushed, back, from, the, far, eastern, front, of, the, civil, war, to, moscow, after, the, second, day, of, the, shooting, and, stalin, remained, in, tsaritsyn, kaplan, referenced, the, bolsheviks, growing, authoritarianism, these, events, persuaded, the, government, to, heed, dzerzhinsky, s, lobbying, for, greater, terror, against, opposition, the, campaign, of, mass, repressions, would, officially, begin, thereafter, the, red, terror, is, began, between, 17, and, 30, august, 1918, regarding, the, red, terror, trotsky, wrote, the, bourgeoisie, today, is, a, falling, class, we, are, forced, to, tear, it, off, to, chop, it, away, the, red, terror, is, a, weapon, utilized, against, a, class, doomed, to, destruction, which, does, not, wish, to, perish, if, the, white, terror, can, only, retard, the, historical, rise, of, the, proletariat, the, red, terror, hastens, the, destruction, of, the, bourgeoisie, in, dealing, with, deserters, trotsky, appealed, to, them, politically, arousing, them, with, the, ideas, of, the, revolution, in, kaluga, voronezh, and, ryazan, tens, of, thousands, of, young, peasants, had, failed, to, answer, the, first, recruiting, summons, by, the, soviets, the, war, commissariat, of, ryazan, succeeded, in, gathering, in, some, fifteen, thousand, of, such, deserters, while, passing, through, ryazan, i, decided, to, take, a, look, at, them, some, of, our, men, tried, to, dissuade, me, something, might, happen, they, warned, me, but, everything, went, off, beautifully, the, men, were, called, out, of, their, barracks, comrade, deserters, come, to, the, meeting, comrade, trotsky, has, come, to, speak, to, you, they, ran, out, excited, boisterous, as, curious, as, schoolboys, i, had, imagined, them, much, worse, and, they, had, imagined, me, as, more, terrible, the, comrade, deserters, were, looking, at, me, with, such, curiosity, that, it, seemed, as, if, their, eyes, would, pop, out, of, their, heads, i, spoke, to, them, for, about, an, hour, and, a, half, it, was, a, most, responsive, audience, i, tried, to, raise, them, in, their, own, eyes, concluding, i, asked, them, to, lift, their, hands, in, token, of, their, loyalty, to, the, revolution, the, new, ideas, infected, them, before, my, very, eyes, they, were, genuinely, enthusiastic, shouted, at, the, tops, of, their, voices, they, would, hardly, let, me, go, i, learned, afterward, with, some, pride, that, one, of, the, best, ways, to, educate, them, was, to, remind, them, what, did, you, promise, comrade, trotsky, later, on, regiments, of, ryazan, deserters, fought, well, at, the, fronts, the, first, use, of, the, punitive, barrier, troops, by, the, red, army, occurred, in, the, summer, and, fall, of, 1918, in, the, eastern, front, during, the, russian, civil, war, when, people, s, commissar, of, military, and, naval, affairs, war, commissar, trotsky, authorized, mikhail, tukhachevsky, commander, of, the, 1st, army, to, station, blocking, detachments, behind, unreliable, infantry, regiments, with, orders, to, shoot, if, front, line, troops, either, deserted, or, retreated, without, permission, the, barrier, troops, comprised, personnel, drawn, from, cheka, punitive, detachments, or, regular, infantry, regiments, in, december, 1918, trotsky, ordered, detachments, of, additional, barrier, troops, be, raised, for, attachment, to, each, infantry, formation, on, december, 18, he, cabled, how, do, things, stand, with, the, blocking, units, as, far, as, i, am, aware, they, have, not, been, included, in, our, establishment, and, it, appears, they, have, no, personnel, it, is, absolutely, essential, that, we, have, at, least, an, embryonic, network, of, blocking, units, and, that, we, work, out, a, procedure, for, bringing, them, up, to, strength, and, deploying, them, the, barrier, troops, were, also, used, to, enforce, bolshevik, control, over, food, supplies, in, areas, controlled, by, the, army, a, role, which, earned, them, the, hatred, of, the, civilian, population, given, the, lack, of, manpower, and, the, 16, opposing, foreign, armies, trotsky, insisted, on, the, use, of, former, tsarist, officers, as, military, specialists, within, the, army, in, combination, with, bolshevik, political, commissars, to, ensure, the, revolutionary, nature, of, the, red, army, lenin, commented, on, this, when, comrade, trotsky, informed, me, recently, that, the, number, of, officers, of, the, old, army, employed, by, our, war, department, runs, into, several, tens, of, thousands, i, perceived, concretely, where, the, secret, of, using, our, enemy, lay, how, to, compel, those, who, had, opposed, communism, to, build, it, how, to, build, communism, with, the, bricks, which, the, capitalists, had, chosen, to, hurl, against, us, we, have, no, other, bricks, and, so, we, must, compel, the, bourgeois, experts, under, the, leadership, of, the, proletariat, to, build, up, our, edifice, with, these, bricks, this, is, what, is, difficult, but, this, is, the, pledge, of, victory, in, september, 1918, the, bolshevik, government, facing, military, difficulties, declared, what, amounted, to, martial, law, and, reorganized, the, red, army, the, supreme, military, council, was, abolished, and, the, position, of, commander, in, chief, was, restored, filled, by, the, commander, of, the, latvian, riflemen, jukums, v, cietis, who, had, formerly, led, the, eastern, front, against, the, czechoslovak, legions, vatsetis, took, charge, of, the, day, to, day, operations, trotsky, became, chairman, of, the, newly, formed, revolutionary, military, council, of, the, republic, and, retained, overall, control, of, the, military, trotsky, and, vatsetis, had, clashed, earlier, in, 1918, while, vatsetis, and, trotsky, s, adviser, mikhail, bonch, bruevich, were, also, on, unfriendly, terms, nevertheless, trotsky, eventually, established, a, working, relationship, with, the, often, prickly, vatsetis, the, reorganization, caused, yet, another, conflict, this, time, between, trotsky, and, stalin, in, late, september, trotsky, appointed, former, imperial, general, pavel, pavlovich, sytin, to, command, the, southern, front, but, in, early, october, 1918, stalin, refused, to, accept, him, and, so, he, was, recalled, from, the, front, lenin, and, yakov, sverdlov, tried, to, make, trotsky, and, stalin, reconcile, but, their, meeting, proved, unsuccessful, in, 1919, 612, hardcore, deserters, of, the, total, 837, 000, draft, dodgers, and, deserters, were, executed, following, trotsky, s, dracionan, measures, according, to, orlando, figes, most, deserters, were, handed, back, to, the, military, authorities, and, formed, into, units, for, transfer, to, one, of, the, rear, armies, or, directly, to, the, front, even, those, registered, as, malicious, deserters, were, returned, to, the, ranks, when, the, demand, for, reinforcements, became, desperate, forges, noted, that, the, red, army, instituted, amnesty, weeks, to, prohibit, punitive, measures, against, desertion, which, encouraged, the, voluntary, return, of, 98, 000, 132, 000, deserters, throughout, late, 1918, and, early, 1919, there, were, a, number, of, attacks, on, trotsky, s, leadership, of, the, red, army, including, veiled, accusations, in, newspaper, articles, inspired, by, stalin, and, a, direct, attack, by, the, military, opposition, at, the, viiith, party, congress, in, march, 1919, on, the, surface, he, weathered, them, successfully, and, was, elected, one, of, only, five, full, members, of, the, first, politburo, after, the, congress, but, he, later, wrote, it, is, no, wonder, that, my, military, work, created, so, many, enemies, for, me, i, did, not, look, to, the, side, i, elbowed, away, those, who, interfered, with, military, success, or, in, the, haste, of, the, work, trod, on, the, toes, of, the, unheeding, and, was, too, busy, even, to, apologize, some, people, remember, such, things, the, dissatisfied, and, those, whose, feelings, had, been, hurt, found, their, way, to, stalin, or, zinoviev, for, these, two, also, nourished, hurts, in, mid, 1919, the, dissatisfied, had, an, opportunity, to, mount, a, serious, challenge, to, trotsky, s, leadership, the, red, army, grew, from, 800, 000, to, 3, 000, 000, and, fought, simultaneously, on, sixteen, fronts, at, the, 3, 4, july, central, committee, meeting, after, a, heated, exchange, the, majority, supported, kamenev, and, smilga, against, v, cietis, and, trotsky, trotsky, s, plan, was, rejected, and, he, was, much, criticized, for, various, alleged, shortcomings, in, his, leadership, style, much, of, it, of, a, personal, nature, stalin, used, this, opportunity, to, pressure, lenin, to, dismiss, trotsky, from, his, post, however, some, significant, changes, to, the, leadership, of, the, red, army, were, made, trotsky, was, temporarily, sent, to, the, southern, front, while, smilga, informally, coordinated, the, work, in, moscow, most, members, of, the, revolutionary, military, council, who, were, not, involved, in, its, day, to, day, operations, were, relieved, of, their, duties, on, 8, july, and, new, members, including, smilga, were, added, the, same, day, while, trotsky, was, in, the, south, v, cietis, was, suddenly, arrested, by, the, cheka, on, suspicion, of, involvement, in, an, anti, soviet, plot, and, replaced, by, sergey, kamenev, after, a, few, weeks, in, the, south, trotsky, returned, to, moscow, and, resumed, control, of, the, red, army, a, year, later, smilga, and, tukhachevsky, were, defeated, during, the, battle, of, warsaw, but, trotsky, refused, this, opportunity, to, pay, smilga, back, which, earned, him, smilga, s, friendship, and, later, his, support, during, the, intra, party, battles, of, the, 1920s, by, october, 1919, the, government, was, in, the, worst, crisis, of, the, civil, war, denikin, s, troops, approached, tula, and, moscow, from, the, south, and, general, nikolay, yudenich, s, troops, approached, petrograd, from, the, west, lenin, decided, that, since, it, was, more, important, to, defend, moscow, petrograd, would, have, to, be, abandoned, trotsky, argued, that, petrograd, needed, to, be, defended, at, least, in, part, to, prevent, estonia, and, finland, from, intervening, in, a, rare, reversal, trotsky, was, supported, by, stalin, and, zinoviev, and, prevailed, against, lenin, in, the, central, committee, with, the, defeat, of, denikin, and, yudenich, in, late, 1919, the, soviet, government, s, emphasis, shifted, to, the, economy, trotsky, spent, the, winter, of, 1919, 20, in, the, urals, region, trying, to, restart, its, economy, a, false, rumor, of, his, assassination, circulated, in, germany, and, the, international, press, on, new, year, s, day, 1920, based, on, his, experiences, he, proposed, abandoning, the, policies, of, war, communism, which, included, confiscating, grain, from, peasants, and, partially, restoring, the, grain, market, still, committed, to, war, communism, lenin, rejected, his, proposal, in, early, 1920, soviet, polish, tensions, eventually, led, to, the, polish, soviet, war, in, the, run, up, and, during, the, war, trotsky, argued, that, the, red, army, was, exhausted, and, the, soviet, government, should, sign, a, peace, treaty, with, poland, as, soon, as, possible, he, did, not, believe, that, the, red, army, would, find, much, support, in, poland, proper, lenin, later, wrote, that, he, and, other, bolshevik, leaders, believed, the, red, army, s, successes, in, the, russian, civil, war, and, against, the, poles, meant, the, defensive, period, of, the, war, with, worldwide, imperialism, was, over, and, we, could, and, had, the, obligation, to, exploit, the, military, situation, to, launch, an, offensive, war, poland, defeated, the, red, army, and, the, offensive, was, turned, back, during, the, battle, of, warsaw, in, august, 1920, back, in, moscow, trotsky, again, argued, for, a, peace, treaty, and, this, time, prevailed, during, the, trade, union, debate, of, 1920, 1921, trotsky, argued, that, trade, unions, should, be, integrated, directly, into, the, state, apparatus, advocating, for, a, militarization, of, labor, to, rebuild, the, soviet, economy, after, the, civil, war, he, believed, that, in, a, workers, state, the, state, should, control, the, unions, with, workers, being, treated, as, soldiers, of, labor, under, strict, discipline, this, position, was, sharply, criticized, by, vladimir, lenin, who, argued, that, trade, unions, should, retain, some, independence, from, the, state, and, act, as, schools, of, communism, rather, than, instruments, of, state, control, lenin, s, view, won, out, at, the, 10th, congress, in, 1921, and, several, of, trotsky, s, supporters, including, nikolay, krestinsky, lost, their, leadership, positions, in, march, 1921, during, the, kronstadt, rebellion, sailors, and, soldiers, in, the, naval, base, of, kronstadt, rose, up, against, the, bolshevik, government, demanding, greater, freedom, for, workers, and, peasants, an, end, to, one, party, rule, and, the, restoration, of, civil, rights, the, rebellion, occurred, simultaneously, with, the, 10th, party, congress, further, destabilizing, the, fragile, political, situation, trotsky, as, commissar, of, war, was, instrumental, in, ordering, the, suppression, of, the, rebellion, on, march, 18, 1921, after, several, failed, negotiations, the, red, army, stormed, the, island, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, thousands, of, kronstadt, sailors, trotsky, justified, the, action, by, presenting, evidence, that, the, rebellion, had, foreign, backing, though, this, claim, has, been, contested, by, several, historians, trotsky, s, role, has, been, the, subject, of, criticism, with, anarchists, such, as, emma, goldman, accusing, him, of, betraying, the, revolution, s, democratic, ideals, vladimir, cherniaev, a, leading, russian, historian, sums, up, trotsky, s, main, contributions, to, the, russian, revolution, trotsky, bears, a, great, deal, of, responsibility, both, for, the, victory, of, the, red, army, in, the, civil, war, and, for, the, establishment, of, a, one, party, authoritarian, state, with, its, apparatus, for, ruthlessly, suppressing, dissent, he, was, an, ideologist, and, practitioner, of, the, red, terror, he, despised, bourgeois, democracy, he, believed, that, spinelessness, and, soft, heartedness, would, destroy, the, revolution, and, that, the, suppression, of, the, propertied, classes, and, political, opponents, would, clear, the, historical, arena, for, socialism, he, was, the, initiator, of, concentration, camps, compulsory, labour, camps, and, the, militarization, of, labour, and, the, state, takeover, of, trade, unions, trotsky, was, implicated, in, many, practices, which, would, become, standard, in, the, stalin, era, including, summary, executions, historian, geoffrey, swain, argues, that, the, bolsheviks, triumphed, in, the, civil, war, because, of, trotsky, s, ability, to, work, with, military, specialists, because, of, the, style, of, work, he, introduced, where, widescale, consultation, was, followed, through, by, swift, and, determined, action, lenin, said, in, 1921, that, trotsky, was, in, love, with, organisation, but, in, working, politics, he, has, not, got, a, clue, swain, explains, the, paradox, by, arguing, that, trotsky, was, not, good, at, teamwork, he, was, a, loner, who, had, mostly, worked, as, a, journalist, not, as, a, professional, revolutionary, like, the, others, in, late, 1921, lenin, s, health, deteriorated, and, he, was, absent, from, moscow, for, longer, periods, of, time, he, had, three, strokes, between, 25, may, 1922, and, 9, march, 1923, which, caused, paralysis, loss, of, speech, and, finally, death, on, 21, january, 1924, with, lenin, increasingly, sidelined, throughout, 1922, stalin, was, elevated, to, the, newly, created, position, of, the, central, committee, general, secretary, zinoviev, and, lev, kamenev, became, part, of, the, troika, triumvirate, formed, by, stalin, to, ensure, that, trotsky, publicly, the, number, two, man, in, the, country, and, lenin, s, heir, presumptive, would, not, succeed, lenin, the, rest, of, the, recently, expanded, politburo, rykov, mikhail, tomsky, bukharin, was, at, first, uncommitted, but, eventually, joined, the, troika, stalin, s, power, of, patronage, in, his, capacity, as, general, secretary, clearly, played, a, role, but, trotsky, and, his, supporters, later, concluded, that, a, more, fundamental, reason, was, the, process, of, slow, bureaucratisation, of, the, soviet, regime, once, the, extreme, conditions, of, the, civil, war, were, over, much, of, the, bolshevik, elite, wanted, normality, while, trotsky, was, personally, and, politically, personified, as, representing, a, turbulent, revolutionary, period, that, they, would, much, rather, leave, behind, although, the, exact, sequence, of, events, is, unclear, evidence, suggests, that, at, first, the, troika, nominated, trotsky, to, head, second, rate, government, departments, e, g, gokhran, the, state, depository, for, valuables, in, mid, july, 1922, kamenev, wrote, a, letter, to, the, recovering, lenin, to, the, effect, that, the, central, committee, is, throwing, or, is, ready, to, throw, a, good, cannon, overboard, lenin, was, shocked, and, responded, throwing, trotsky, overboard, surely, you, are, hinting, at, that, it, is, impossible, to, interpret, it, otherwise, is, the, height, of, stupidity, if, you, do, not, consider, me, already, hopelessly, foolish, how, can, you, think, of, that, from, then, until, his, final, stroke, lenin, spent, much, of, his, time, trying, to, devise, a, way, to, prevent, a, split, within, the, communist, party, leadership, which, was, reflected, in, lenin, s, testament, as, part, of, this, effort, on, 11, september, 1922, lenin, proposed, that, trotsky, become, his, deputy, at, the, council, of, people, s, commissars, sovnarkom, the, politburo, approved, the, proposal, but, trotsky, categorically, refused, lenin, s, proposal, has, been, interpreted, by, various, scholars, as, evidence, that, he, designated, trotsky, as, a, successor, as, head, of, government, in, late, 1922, trotsky, secured, an, alliance, with, lenin, against, stalin, and, the, emerging, soviet, bureaucracy, stalin, had, recently, engineered, the, creation, of, the, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, ussr, further, centralising, state, control, the, alliance, proved, effective, on, the, issue, of, foreign, trade, but, was, hindered, by, lenin, s, progressing, illness, in, january, 1923, lenin, amended, his, testament, to, suggest, that, stalin, should, be, removed, as, the, party, s, general, secretary, while, also, mildly, criticising, trotsky, and, other, bolshevik, leaders, the, relationship, between, stalin, and, lenin, had, broken, down, completely, by, this, time, as, was, demonstrated, during, an, event, where, stalin, crudely, insulted, lenin, s, wife, nadezhda, krupskaya, in, march, 1923, days, before, his, third, stroke, lenin, asked, trotsky, to, denounce, stalin, and, his, so, called, great, russian, nationalistic, campaign, at, the, xiith, party, congress, at, the, xiith, party, congress, in, april, 1923, however, just, after, lenin, s, final, stroke, trotsky, did, not, raise, the, issue, instead, he, made, a, speech, about, intra, party, democracy, while, avoiding, any, direct, confrontation, of, the, troika, stalin, had, prepared, for, the, congress, by, replacing, many, local, party, delegates, with, those, loyal, to, him, mostly, at, the, expense, of, zinoviev, and, kamenev, s, backers, the, delegates, most, of, whom, were, unaware, of, the, divisions, within, the, politburo, gave, trotsky, a, standing, ovation, this, upset, the, troika, already, infuriated, by, karl, radek, s, article, leon, trotsky, organiser, of, victory, published, in, pravda, on, 14, march, 1923, stalin, delivered, the, key, reports, on, organisational, structure, and, questions, of, nationality, while, zinoviev, delivered, the, central, committee, political, report, traditionally, lenin, s, prerogative, among, the, resolutions, adopted, by, the, xiith, congress, were, those, calling, for, greater, democracy, within, the, party, but, these, were, vague, and, remained, unimplemented, the, power, struggle, in, the, soviet, union, which, emerged, during, lenin, s, illness, and, eventual, death, would, also, determine, the, prospect, of, world, revolution, in, particular, the, leadership, of, the, german, communist, party, had, requested, that, moscow, send, trotsky, to, germany, to, direct, the, 1923, insurrection, however, this, proposal, was, rejected, by, the, politburo, which, was, controlled, by, stalin, zinoviev, and, kamenev, who, decided, to, send, a, commission, of, lower, ranking, russian, communist, party, members, starting, in, mid, 1923, the, soviet, economy, ran, into, significant, difficulties, which, led, to, numerous, strikes, countrywide, two, secret, groups, within, the, communist, party, workers, truth, and, workers, group, were, uncovered, and, suppressed, by, the, soviet, secret, police, on, 8, october, 1923, trotsky, sent, a, letter, to, the, central, committee, and, the, central, control, commission, attributing, these, difficulties, to, lack, of, intra, party, democracy, trotsky, wrote, in, the, fiercest, moment, of, war, communism, the, system, of, appointment, within, the, party, did, not, have, one, tenth, of, the, extent, that, it, has, now, appointment, of, the, secretaries, of, provincial, committees, is, now, the, rule, that, creates, for, the, secretary, a, position, essentially, independent, of, the, local, organization, the, bureaucratization, of, the, party, apparatus, has, developed, to, unheard, of, proportions, by, means, of, the, method, of, secretarial, selection, there, has, been, created, a, very, broad, stratum, of, party, workers, entering, into, the, apparatus, of, the, government, of, the, party, who, completely, renounce, their, own, party, opinion, at, least, the, open, expression, of, it, as, though, assuming, that, the, secretarial, hierarchy, is, the, apparatus, which, creates, party, opinion, and, party, decisions, beneath, this, stratum, abstaining, from, their, own, opinions, there, lies, the, broad, mass, of, the, party, before, whom, every, decision, stands, in, the, form, of, a, summons, or, a, command, other, senior, communists, who, had, similar, concerns, sent, the, declaration, of, 46, to, the, central, committee, on, 15, october, in, which, they, wrote, we, observe, an, ever, progressing, barely, disguised, division, of, the, party, into, a, secretarial, hierarchy, and, into, laymen, into, professional, party, functionaries, chosen, from, above, and, the, other, party, masses, who, take, no, part, in, social, life, free, discussion, within, the, party, has, virtually, disappeared, party, public, opinion, has, been, stifled, it, is, the, secretarial, hierarchy, the, party, hierarchy, which, to, an, ever, greater, degree, chooses, the, delegates, to, the, conferences, and, congresses, which, to, an, ever, greater, degree, are, becoming, the, executive, conferences, of, this, hierarchy, although, the, text, of, these, letters, remained, secret, at, the, time, they, had, a, significant, effect, on, the, party, leadership, and, prompted, a, partial, retreat, by, the, troika, and, its, supporters, on, the, issue, of, intra, party, democracy, notably, in, zinoviev, s, pravda, article, published, on, 7, november, throughout, november, the, troika, tried, to, come, up, with, a, compromise, to, placate, or, at, least, temporarily, neutralise, trotsky, and, his, supporters, their, task, was, made, easier, by, the, fact, that, trotsky, was, sick, in, november, and, december, the, first, draft, of, the, resolution, was, rejected, by, trotsky, which, led, to, the, formation, of, a, special, group, consisting, of, stalin, trotsky, and, kamenev, which, was, charged, with, drafting, a, mutually, acceptable, compromise, on, 5, december, the, politburo, and, the, central, control, commission, unanimously, adopted, the, group, s, final, draft, as, its, resolution, on, 8, december, trotsky, published, an, open, letter, in, which, he, expounded, on, the, recently, adopted, resolution, s, ideas, the, troika, used, his, letter, as, an, excuse, to, launch, a, campaign, against, trotsky, accusing, him, of, factionalism, setting, the, youth, against, the, fundamental, generation, of, old, revolutionary, bolsheviks, and, other, sins, trotsky, defended, his, position, in, a, series, of, seven, letters, which, were, collected, as, the, new, course, in, january, 1924, the, illusion, of, a, monolithic, bolshevik, leadership, was, thus, shattered, and, a, lively, intra, party, discussion, ensued, both, in, local, party, organizations, and, in, the, pages, of, pravda, the, discussion, lasted, most, of, december, and, january, until, the, xiiith, party, conference, of, 16, 18, january, 1924, those, who, opposed, the, central, committee, s, position, in, the, debate, were, thereafter, referred, to, as, members, of, the, left, opposition, in, 1924, in, a, series, of, conferences, at, sverdlov, university, stalin, cited, several, times, in, a, critical, way, the, permanentists, as, the, followers, of, trotsky, permanent, revolution, since, the, troika, controlled, the, party, apparatus, through, stalin, s, secretariat, and, pravda, through, its, editor, bukharin, it, was, able, to, direct, the, discussion, and, the, process, of, delegate, selection, although, trotsky, s, position, prevailed, within, the, red, army, and, moscow, universities, and, received, about, half, the, votes, in, the, moscow, party, organisation, it, was, defeated, elsewhere, and, the, conference, was, packed, with, pro, troika, delegates, in, the, end, only, three, delegates, voted, for, trotsky, s, position, and, the, conference, denounced, trotskyism, as, a, petty, bourgeois, deviation, members, of, the, left, opposition, represented, most, of, the, international, elements, of, the, party, and, held, offices, at, the, highest, responsibility, with, christian, rakovsky, adolph, joffe, and, nikolay, krestinsky, holding, ambassadorial, posts, in, london, paris, tokyo, and, berlin, internationally, trotsky, s, opposition, and, criticism, of, the, ruling, troika, received, support, from, several, central, committee, members, of, foreign, communist, parties, this, included, christian, rakovsky, chairman, of, the, ukraine, sovnarkom, boris, souvarine, of, the, french, communist, party, and, the, central, committee, of, the, polish, communist, party, which, was, led, by, prominent, theoreticians, such, as, maksymilian, horwitz, maria, koszutska, and, adolf, warski, there, was, little, overt, political, disagreement, within, the, soviet, leadership, throughout, most, of, 1924, on, the, surface, trotsky, remained, the, most, prominent, and, popular, bolshevik, leader, although, his, mistakes, were, often, alluded, to, by, troika, partisans, behind, the, scenes, he, was, completely, cut, off, from, the, decision, making, process, politburo, meetings, were, pure, formalities, since, all, key, decisions, were, made, ahead, of, time, by, the, troika, and, its, supporters, trotsky, s, control, over, the, military, was, undermined, by, reassigning, his, deputy, ephraim, sklyansky, and, appointing, mikhail, frunze, who, was, being, groomed, to, take, trotsky, s, place, at, the, thirteenth, party, congress, in, may, trotsky, delivered, a, conciliatory, speech, none, of, us, desires, or, is, able, to, dispute, the, will, of, the, party, clearly, the, party, is, always, right, we, can, only, be, right, with, and, by, the, party, for, history, has, provided, no, other, way, of, being, in, the, right, the, english, have, a, saying, my, country, right, or, wrong, whether, it, is, in, the, right, or, in, the, wrong, it, is, my, country, we, have, much, better, historical, justification, in, saying, whether, it, is, right, or, wrong, in, certain, individual, concrete, cases, it, is, my, party, and, if, the, party, adopts, a, decision, which, one, or, other, of, us, thinks, unjust, he, will, say, just, or, unjust, it, is, my, party, and, i, shall, support, the, consequences, of, the, decision, to, the, end, in, the, meantime, the, left, opposition, which, had, coagulated, somewhat, unexpectedly, in, late, 1923, and, lacked, a, definite, platform, aside, from, general, dissatisfaction, with, the, intra, party, regime, began, to, crystallise, it, lost, some, less, dedicated, members, to, the, harassment, by, the, troika, but, it, also, began, formulating, a, program, economically, the, left, opposition, opposed, the, development, of, capitalist, elements, in, the, soviet, economy, and, advocated, for, accelerated, industrialization, through, state, led, policies, that, put, them, at, odds, with, bukharin, and, rykov, the, right, within, the, party, who, supported, the, troika, on, the, question, of, world, revolution, trotsky, and, karl, radek, saw, a, period, of, stability, in, europe, while, stalin, and, zinoviev, confidently, predicted, an, acceleration, of, revolution, in, western, europe, in, 1924, on, the, theoretical, plane, trotsky, remained, committed, to, the, bolshevik, idea, that, the, soviet, union, could, not, create, a, true, socialist, society, in, the, absence, of, the, world, revolution, while, stalin, gradually, came, up, with, a, policy, of, building, socialism, in, one, country, these, ideological, divisions, provided, much, of, the, intellectual, basis, for, the, political, divide, between, trotsky, and, the, left, opposition, on, the, one, hand, and, stalin, and, his, allies, on, the, other, at, the, thirteenth, congress, kamenev, and, zinoviev, helped, stalin, defuse, lenin, s, testament, which, belatedly, came, to, the, surface, but, just, after, the, congress, the, troika, always, an, alliance, of, convenience, showed, signs, of, weakness, stalin, began, making, poorly, veiled, accusations, about, zinoviev, and, kamenev, yet, in, october, 1924, trotsky, published, lessons, of, october, a, summary, of, the, events, of, the, 1917, revolution, he, described, zinoviev, and, kamenev, s, opposition, to, the, bolshevik, seizure, of, power, in, 1917, something, they, would, have, preferred, left, unmentioned, this, started, a, new, round, of, intra, party, struggle, which, became, known, as, the, literary, discussion, with, zinoviev, and, kamenev, again, allied, with, stalin, against, trotsky, their, criticism, of, trotsky, was, concentrated, in, three, areas, trotsky, was, again, sick, and, unable, to, respond, while, his, opponents, mobilised, all, their, resources, to, denounce, him, they, succeeded, in, damaging, his, military, reputation, so, much, that, he, was, forced, to, resign, as, people, s, commissar, of, army, and, fleet, affairs, and, chairman, of, the, revolutionary, military, council, on, 6, january, 1925, zinoviev, demanded, trotsky, s, expulsion, from, the, communist, party, but, stalin, refused, to, go, along, and, played, the, role, of, a, moderate, trotsky, kept, his, politburo, seat, but, was, effectively, put, on, probation, for, trotsky, 1925, was, a, difficult, year, after, the, bruising, literary, discussion, and, losing, his, red, army, posts, he, was, effectively, unemployed, throughout, the, winter, and, spring, in, may, 1925, he, was, given, three, posts, chairman, of, the, concessions, committee, head, of, the, electro, technical, board, and, chairman, of, the, scientific, technical, board, of, industry, trotsky, wrote, in, my, life, that, he, was, taking, a, rest, from, politics, and, naturally, plunged, into, the, new, line, of, work, up, to, my, ears, trotsky, would, also, deliver, a, tribute, to, lenin, in, his, 1925, short, book, lenin, some, contemporary, accounts, paint, a, picture, of, a, remote, and, distracted, man, later, in, the, year, trotsky, resigned, his, two, technical, positions, maintaining, stalin, instigated, interference, and, sabotage, and, concentrated, on, his, work, in, the, concessions, committee, in, one, of, the, few, political, developments, that, affected, trotsky, in, 1925, the, circumstances, of, the, controversy, over, lenin, s, testament, were, described, by, american, marxist, max, eastman, in, his, book, since, lenin, died, 1925, trotsky, denied, these, statements, made, by, eastman, in, an, article, he, wrote, in, the, meantime, the, troika, finally, broke, up, bukharin, and, rykov, sided, with, stalin, while, krupskaya, and, soviet, commissar, of, finance, grigory, sokolnikov, aligned, with, zinoviev, and, kamenev, the, struggle, became, open, at, the, september, 1925, meeting, of, the, central, committee, and, came, to, a, head, at, the, xiv, party, congress, in, december, 1925, with, only, the, leningrad, party, organization, behind, them, zinoviev, and, kamenev, dubbed, the, new, opposition, were, thoroughly, defeated, while, trotsky, refused, to, get, involved, in, the, fight, and, did, not, speak, at, the, congress, in, early, 1926, zinoviev, kamenev, and, their, supporters, in, the, new, opposition, gravitated, closer, to, trotsky, s, supporters, and, the, two, groups, soon, formed, an, alliance, which, also, incorporated, some, smaller, opposition, groups, within, the, communist, party, the, alliance, became, known, as, the, united, opposition, the, united, opposition, was, repeatedly, threatened, with, sanctions, by, the, stalinist, leadership, of, the, communist, party, and, trotsky, had, to, agree, to, tactical, retreats, mostly, to, preserve, his, alliance, with, zinoviev, and, kamenev, the, opposition, remained, united, against, stalin, throughout, 1926, and, 1927, especially, on, the, issue, of, the, chinese, revolution, the, methods, used, by, the, stalinists, against, the, opposition, became, more, and, more, extreme, at, the, xv, party, conference, in, october, 1926, trotsky, could, barely, speak, because, of, interruptions, and, catcalls, and, at, the, end, of, the, conference, he, lost, his, politburo, seat, in, 1927, stalin, started, using, the, gpu, soviet, secret, police, to, infiltrate, and, discredit, the, opposition, rank, and, file, oppositionists, were, increasingly, harassed, sometimes, expelled, from, the, party, and, even, arrested, soviet, policy, toward, the, chinese, revolution, became, the, ideological, line, of, demarcation, between, stalin, and, the, united, opposition, the, chinese, revolution, began, on, 10, october, 1911, resulting, in, the, abdication, of, the, chinese, emperor, puyi, on, 12, february, 1912, sun, yat, sen, established, the, republic, of, china, in, reality, however, the, republic, controlled, very, little, of, the, country, much, of, china, was, divided, between, various, regional, warlords, the, republican, government, established, a, new, nationalist, people, s, army, and, a, national, people, s, party, the, kuomintang, in, 1920, the, kuomintang, opened, relations, with, soviet, russia, with, soviet, help, the, republic, of, china, built, up, the, nationalist, people, s, army, with, the, development, of, the, nationalist, army, a, northern, expedition, was, planned, to, smash, the, power, of, the, warlords, of, the, northern, part, of, the, country, this, northern, expedition, became, a, point, of, contention, over, foreign, policy, by, stalin, and, trotsky, stalin, tried, to, persuade, the, small, chinese, communist, party, to, merge, with, the, kuomintang, kmt, nationalists, to, bring, about, a, bourgeois, revolution, before, attempting, to, bring, about, a, soviet, style, working, class, revolution, trotsky, wanted, the, communist, party, to, complete, an, orthodox, proletarian, revolution, and, have, clear, class, independence, from, the, kmt, stalin, funded, the, kmt, during, the, expedition, stalin, countered, trotskyist, criticism, by, making, a, secret, speech, in, which, he, said, that, chiang, kai, shek, s, right, wing, kuomintang, were, the, only, ones, capable, of, defeating, the, imperialists, that, chiang, had, funding, from, the, rich, merchants, and, that, his, forces, were, to, be, utilized, until, squeezed, for, all, usefulness, like, a, lemon, before, being, discarded, however, chiang, quickly, reversed, the, tables, in, the, shanghai, massacre, of, 12, april, 1927, by, massacring, the, communist, party, in, shanghai, midway, through, the, northern, expedition, on, the, tenth, anniversary, of, the, october, revolution, the, opposition, held, a, street, demonstration, in, moscow, against, stalin, s, government, that, was, dispersed, by, the, sovietic, authorities, and, trotsky, was, expelled, from, the, communist, party, shortly, after, trotsky, gave, the, eulogy, at, the, funeral, of, his, friend, the, soviet, diplomat, adolph, joffe, in, november, 1927, it, would, be, the, last, speech, that, trotsky, would, give, in, the, soviet, union, when, the, xv, party, congress, made, united, opposition, views, incompatible, with, membership, in, the, communist, party, zinoviev, kamenev, and, their, supporters, capitulated, and, renounced, their, alliance, with, the, left, opposition, trotsky, and, most, of, his, followers, on, the, other, hand, refused, to, surrender, and, stayed, the, course, trotsky, was, exiled, to, alma, ata, kazakhstan, on, 31, january, 1928, he, was, expelled, from, the, soviet, union, to, turkey, in, february, 1929, accompanied, by, his, wife, natalia, sedova, and, their, eldest, son, lev, after, trotsky, s, expulsion, from, the, soviet, union, trotskyists, within, the, soviet, union, began, to, waver, between, 1929, and, 1932, most, leading, members, of, the, left, opposition, surrendered, to, stalin, admitted, their, mistakes, and, were, reinstated, in, the, communist, party, one, initial, exception, to, this, was, christian, rakovsky, who, inspired, trotsky, between, 1929, and, 1934, with, his, refusal, to, capitulate, as, state, suppression, of, any, remaining, opposition, to, stalin, increased, by, the, year, in, late, 1932, rakovsky, had, failed, with, an, attempt, to, flee, the, soviet, union, and, was, exiled, to, yakutia, in, march, 1933, answering, trotsky, s, request, the, french, mathematician, and, trotskyist, jean, van, heijenoort, together, with, his, fellow, activist, pierre, frank, unsuccessfully, called, on, the, influential, soviet, author, maxim, gorky, to, intervene, in, favor, of, christian, rakovsky, and, boarded, the, ship, he, was, traveling, on, near, constantinople, according, to, heijenoort, they, only, managed, to, meet, gorky, s, son, maxim, peshkov, who, reportedly, told, them, that, his, father, was, indisposed, but, promised, to, pass, on, their, request, rakovsky, was, the, last, prominent, trotskyist, to, capitulate, to, stalin, in, april, 1934, when, rakovsky, formally, admitted, his, mistakes, his, letter, to, pravda, titled, there, should, be, no, mercy, depicted, trotsky, and, his, supporters, as, agents, of, the, german, gestapo, rakovsky, was, appointed, to, high, office, in, the, commissariat, for, health, and, allowed, to, return, to, moscow, also, serving, as, soviet, ambassador, to, japan, in, 1935, however, rakovsky, was, cited, in, allegations, involving, the, killing, of, sergey, kirov, and, was, arrested, and, imprisoned, in, late, 1937, during, the, great, purge, almost, all, trotskyists, who, were, still, within, the, soviet, union, s, borders, were, executed, in, the, great, purges, of, 1936, 1938, although, rakovsky, survived, until, the, medvedev, forest, massacre, of, september, 1941, where, he, was, shot, dead, along, with, 156, other, prisoners, on, stalin, s, orders, less, than, three, months, into, the, axis, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, also, among, the, medvedev, forest, victims, was, trotsky, s, sister, kamenev, s, first, wife, olga, kameneva, after, being, deported, from, the, soviet, union, in, february, 1929, trotsky, arrived, in, turkey, during, his, first, two, months, in, turkey, trotsky, lived, with, his, wife, and, eldest, son, at, the, soviet, union, consulate, in, istanbul, and, then, at, a, nearby, hotel, in, the, city, in, april, 1929, trotsky, his, wife, and, son, were, moved, to, the, island, of, b, y, kada, by, the, turkish, authorities, on, b, y, kada, they, were, moved, into, a, house, called, the, yanaros, mansion, during, his, exile, in, turkey, trotsky, was, under, the, surveillance, of, the, turkish, police, forces, of, mustafa, kemal, pasha, trotsky, was, also, at, risk, from, the, many, former, white, army, officers, who, lived, on, prinkipo, officers, who, had, opposed, the, october, revolution, and, who, had, been, defeated, by, trotsky, and, the, red, army, in, the, russian, civil, war, however, trotsky, s, european, supporters, volunteered, to, serve, as, bodyguards, and, assured, his, safety, at, this, time, he, made, requests, to, enter, belgium, france, norway, germany, and, the, united, kingdom, but, all, refused, access, soon, after, arriving, in, turkey, trotsky, established, the, publication, bulletin, of, the, opposition, a, russian, language, journal, it, was, first, published, in, july, 1929, in, paris, in, 1931, trotsky, wrote, a, letter, to, a, friend, entitled, what, is, fascism, in, which, he, attempted, to, define, fascism, and, asserted, that, the, communist, international, was, wrong, to, describe, the, dictatorship, of, primo, de, rivera, as, fascist, because, it, was, not, a, mass, movement, arising, from, a, base, in, the, lower, classes, on, 20, february, 1932, trotsky, and, all, of, his, family, lost, their, soviet, citizenship, and, were, forbidden, to, enter, the, soviet, union, in, 1932, trotsky, entered, via, a, port, into, the, fascist, kingdom, of, italy, on, his, way, to, a, socialist, conference, in, denmark, by, the, end, of, 1932, trotsky, had, made, contact, with, the, anti, stalin, opposition, inside, the, ussr, and, discussed, the, possibility, of, forming, a, bloc, there, was, no, evidence, of, any, alliance, with, nazi, germany, or, japan, as, the, soviet, union, government, claimed, the, alleged, members, of, the, anti, stalin, bloc, were, zinovievites, rightists, and, trotskyists, who, capitulated, to, stalin, kamenev, and, zinoviev, were, also, alleged, members, of, the, bloc, trotsky, wanted, by, no, means, that, the, alliance, became, a, fusion, and, he, was, afraid, of, the, right, gaining, much, power, inside, the, bloc, historian, pierre, brou, concluded, that, the, bloc, dissolved, in, early, 1933, since, some, of, its, members, like, zinoviev, and, kamenev, joined, stalin, again, and, because, there, were, no, letters, in, the, trotsky, harvard, archive, mentioning, the, bloc, after, 1932, in, july, 1933, trotsky, was, offered, asylum, in, france, by, prime, minister, douard, daladier, trotsky, accepted, the, offer, but, he, was, forbidden, to, live, in, paris, and, soon, found, himself, under, the, surveillance, of, the, french, police, from, july, 1933, to, february, 1934, trotsky, and, his, wife, lived, in, royan, the, philosopher, and, activist, simone, weil, also, arranged, for, trotsky, and, his, bodyguards, to, stay, for, a, few, days, at, her, parents, house, following, the, 6, february, 1934, crisis, in, france, the, french, minister, of, internal, affairs, albert, sarraut, signed, a, decree, to, deport, trotsky, from, france, however, no, foreign, government, was, found, willing, to, accept, trotsky, within, its, borders, accordingly, the, french, authorities, instructed, trotsky, to, move, to, a, residence, in, the, tiny, village, of, barbizon, under, the, strict, surveillance, of, the, french, police, where, trotsky, found, his, contact, with, the, outside, world, to, be, even, worse, than, during, his, exile, in, turkey, in, may, 1935, soon, after, the, french, government, had, agreed, to, the, franco, soviet, treaty, of, mutual, assistance, with, the, soviet, union, government, trotsky, was, officially, told, that, he, was, no, longer, welcome, in, france, after, weighing, his, options, trotsky, applied, to, move, to, norway, after, obtaining, permission, from, justice, minister, trygve, lie, to, enter, the, country, trotsky, and, his, wife, became, a, guest, of, konrad, knudsen, at, norderhov, near, h, nefoss, and, spent, over, a, year, living, at, knudsen, s, house, from, 18, june, 1935, to, 2, september, 1936, trotsky, was, hospitalized, for, a, few, weeks, at, the, nearby, oslo, community, hospital, from, 19, september, 1935, following, french, media, complaints, about, trotsky, s, role, in, encouraging, the, mass, strikes, in, france, in, may, and, june, 1936, with, his, articles, the, johan, nygaardsvold, led, norwegian, government, began, to, exhibit, disquiet, about, trotsky, s, actions, in, the, summer, of, 1936, trotsky, s, asylum, was, increasingly, made, a, political, issue, by, the, fascist, nasjonal, samling, led, by, vidkun, quisling, along, with, an, increase, in, pressure, from, the, soviet, government, on, the, norwegian, authorities, on, 5, august, 1936, knudsen, s, house, was, burgled, by, fascists, from, the, nasjonal, samling, while, trotsky, and, his, wife, were, out, on, a, seashore, trip, with, knudsen, and, his, wife, the, burglars, targeted, trotsky, s, works, and, archives, for, vandalism, the, raid, was, largely, thwarted, by, knudsen, s, daughter, hj, rdis, although, the, burglars, did, take, a, few, papers, from, the, nearest, table, as, they, left, although, the, perpetrators, were, caught, and, put, on, trial, the, evidence, obtained, in, the, burglary, was, used, by, the, government, to, make, claims, against, trotsky, on, 14, august, 1936, the, soviet, press, agency, tass, announced, the, discovery, of, a, trotskyist, zinovievist, plot, and, the, imminent, start, of, the, moscow, trials, of, the, accused, trotsky, demanded, a, complete, and, open, enquiry, into, moscow, s, accusations, the, accused, were, sentenced, to, death, including, grigory, zinoviev, and, lev, kamenev, and, executed, on, 25, august, 1936, on, 26, august, 1936, eight, policemen, arrived, at, knudsen, s, house, demanding, that, trotsky, sign, new, conditions, for, residing, in, norway, these, conditions, included, agreeing, to, write, no, more, about, current, political, matters, to, give, no, interviews, and, to, have, all, his, correspondence, incoming, and, outgoing, inspected, by, the, police, trotsky, categorically, refused, the, conditions, and, trotsky, was, then, told, that, he, and, his, wife, would, soon, be, moved, to, another, residence, the, following, day, trotsky, was, interrogated, by, the, police, about, his, political, activities, with, the, police, officially, citing, trotsky, as, a, witness, to, the, fascist, raid, of, 5, august, 1936, on, 2, september, 1936, four, weeks, after, the, break, in, at, knudsen, s, house, trygve, lie, ordered, that, trotsky, and, his, wife, be, transferred, to, a, farm, in, hurum, where, they, were, under, house, arrest, the, treatment, of, trotsky, and, his, wife, at, hurum, was, harsh, as, they, were, forced, to, stay, indoors, for, 22, hours, per, day, under, the, constant, guard, of, thirteen, policemen, with, only, one, hour, permitted, twice, a, day, for, a, walk, on, the, farm, trotsky, was, prevented, from, posting, any, letters, and, prevented, from, arguing, back, against, his, critics, in, norway, and, beyond, only, trotsky, s, lawyers, and, the, norwegian, labour, party, parliamentary, leader, olav, scheflo, were, permitted, to, visit, from, october, 1936, even, the, outdoor, walks, were, prohibited, for, trotsky, and, his, wife, trotsky, did, eventually, manage, to, smuggle, out, one, letter, on, 18, december, 1936, titled, the, moscow, confessions, on, 19, december, 1936, trotsky, and, his, wife, were, deported, from, norway, after, being, put, on, the, norwegian, oil, tanker, ruth, under, guard, by, jonas, lie, when, later, living, in, mexico, trotsky, was, utterly, scathing, about, the, treatment, he, received, during, his, 108, days, at, hurum, and, accused, the, norwegian, government, of, trying, to, prevent, him, from, publicly, voicing, his, strong, opposition, to, the, moscow, trials, and, other, show, trials, saying, when, i, look, back, today, on, this, period, of, internment, i, must, say, that, never, anywhere, in, the, course, of, my, entire, life, and, i, have, lived, through, many, things, was, i, persecuted, with, as, much, miserable, cynicism, as, i, was, by, the, norwegian, socialist, government, for, four, months, these, ministers, dripping, with, democratic, hypocrisy, gripped, me, in, a, stranglehold, to, prevent, me, from, protesting, the, greatest, crime, history, may, ever, know, the, ruth, arrived, in, mexico, on, 9, january, 1937, on, trotsky, s, arrival, the, mexican, president, l, zaro, c, rdenas, welcomed, trotsky, to, mexico, and, arranged, for, his, special, train, the, hidalgo, to, bring, trotsky, to, mexico, city, from, the, port, of, tampico, from, january, 1937, to, april, 1939, trotsky, and, his, wife, lived, in, the, coyoac, n, area, of, mexico, city, at, la, casa, azul, the, blue, house, the, home, of, the, painter, frida, kahlo, with, whom, trotsky, had, an, affair, and, kahlo, s, husband, and, fellow, painter, diego, rivera, she, later, presented, him, with, self, portrait, dedicated, to, leon, trotsky, on, his, birthday, the, 20th, anniversary, of, the, october, revolution, his, final, move, was, a, few, blocks, away, to, a, residence, on, avenida, viena, in, april, 1939, following, a, break, with, rivera, trotsky, wrote, prolifically, while, in, exile, penning, several, key, works, including, his, history, of, the, russian, revolution, 1930, and, the, revolution, betrayed, 1936, a, critique, of, the, soviet, union, under, stalinism, he, argued, that, the, soviet, state, had, become, a, degenerated, workers, state, controlled, by, an, undemocratic, bureaucracy, which, would, eventually, either, be, overthrown, via, a, political, revolution, establishing, a, workers, democracy, or, degenerate, into, a, capitalist, class, while, in, mexico, trotsky, also, worked, closely, with, james, cannon, joseph, hansen, and, farrell, dobbs, of, the, socialist, workers, party, of, the, united, states, and, other, supporters, cannon, a, long, time, leading, member, of, the, american, communist, movement, had, supported, trotsky, in, the, struggle, against, stalinism, since, he, had, first, read, trotsky, s, criticisms, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1928, trotsky, s, critique, of, the, stalinist, regime, though, banned, was, distributed, to, leaders, of, the, comintern, among, his, other, supporters, was, chen, duxiu, founder, of, the, chinese, communist, party, while, in, mexico, trotsky, worked, with, andr, breton, and, diego, rivera, to, write, the, manifesto, for, an, independent, revolutionary, art, published, in, 1938, which, emphasized, the, need, for, artistic, freedom, outside, the, constraints, of, capitalist, and, stalinist, regimes, this, collaboration, inspired, the, creation, of, the, international, federation, of, independent, revolutionary, art, fiari, in, 1938, however, this, organization, was, short, lived, and, ended, before, 1940, in, august, 1936, the, first, moscow, show, trial, of, the, so, called, trotskyite, zinovievite, terrorist, center, was, staged, in, front, of, an, international, audience, during, the, trial, zinoviev, kamenev, and, 14, other, accused, most, of, them, prominent, old, bolsheviks, confessed, to, having, plotted, with, trotsky, to, kill, stalin, and, other, members, of, the, soviet, leadership, the, court, found, every, defendant, guilty, in, absentia, including, trotsky, sentencing, them, to, death, the, second, show, trial, of, karl, radek, grigori, sokolnikov, yuri, pyatakov, and, 14, others, took, place, in, january, 1937, during, which, more, alleged, conspiracies, and, crimes, were, linked, to, trotsky, the, findings, were, published, in, the, book, not, guilty, the, moscow, trials, are, perpetuated, under, the, banner, of, socialism, we, will, not, concede, this, banner, to, the, masters, of, falsehood, if, our, generation, happens, to, be, too, weak, to, establish, socialism, over, the, earth, we, will, hand, the, spotless, banner, down, to, our, children, the, struggle, which, is, in, the, offing, transcends, by, far, the, importance, of, individuals, factions, and, parties, it, is, the, struggle, for, the, future, of, all, mankind, it, will, be, severe, it, will, be, lengthy, whoever, seeks, physical, comfort, and, spiritual, calm, let, him, step, aside, in, time, of, reaction, it, is, more, convenient, to, lean, on, the, bureaucracy, than, on, the, truth, but, all, those, for, whom, the, word, socialism, is, not, a, hollow, sound, but, the, content, of, their, moral, life, forward, neither, threats, nor, persecutions, nor, violations, can, stop, us, be, it, even, over, our, bleaching, bones, the, future, will, triumph, we, will, blaze, the, trail, for, it, it, will, conquer, under, all, the, severe, blows, of, fate, i, shall, be, happy, as, in, the, best, days, of, my, youth, because, my, friends, the, highest, human, happiness, is, not, the, exploitation, of, the, present, but, the, preparation, of, the, future, historical, historical, for, fear, of, splitting, the, communist, movement, trotsky, initially, opposed, the, idea, of, establishing, parallel, communist, parties, or, a, parallel, international, communist, organization, that, would, compete, with, the, third, international, in, mid, 1933, after, the, nazi, takeover, in, germany, and, the, comintern, s, response, to, it, he, changed, his, mind, he, said, an, organization, which, was, not, roused, by, the, thunder, of, fascism, and, which, submits, docilely, to, such, outrageous, acts, of, the, bureaucracy, demonstrates, thereby, that, it, is, dead, and, that, nothing, can, ever, revive, it, in, all, our, subsequent, work, it, is, necessary, to, take, as, our, point, of, departure, the, historical, collapse, of, the, official, communist, international, in, 1938, trotsky, and, his, supporters, founded, the, fourth, international, which, was, intended, to, be, a, revolutionary, and, internationalist, alternative, to, the, stalinist, comintern, towards, the, end, of, 1939, trotsky, agreed, to, go, to, the, united, states, to, appear, as, a, witness, before, the, dies, committee, of, the, house, of, representatives, a, forerunner, of, the, house, committee, on, un, american, activities, representative, martin, dies, jr, chairman, of, the, committee, demanded, the, suppression, of, the, american, communist, party, trotsky, intended, to, use, the, forum, to, expose, the, nkvd, s, activities, against, him, and, his, followers, he, made, it, clear, that, he, also, intended, to, argue, against, the, suppression, of, the, american, communist, party, and, to, use, the, committee, as, a, platform, for, a, call, to, transform, world, war, ii, into, a, world, revolution, many, of, his, supporters, argued, against, his, appearance, when, the, committee, learned, the, nature, of, the, testimony, trotsky, intended, to, present, it, refused, to, hear, him, and, he, was, denied, a, visa, to, enter, the, united, states, on, hearing, about, it, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, immediately, accused, trotsky, of, being, in, the, pay, of, the, oil, magnates, and, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, after, quarreling, with, diego, rivera, trotsky, moved, to, his, final, residence, on, avenida, viena, in, april, 1939, on, 27, february, 1940, trotsky, wrote, a, document, known, as, trotsky, s, testament, in, which, he, expressed, his, final, thoughts, and, feelings, for, posterity, he, was, suffering, from, high, blood, pressure, and, feared, that, he, would, suffer, a, cerebral, haemorrhage, he, would, also, reiterate, his, unshaken, faith, in, a, communist, future, after, forcefully, denying, stalin, s, accusations, that, he, had, betrayed, the, working, class, he, thanked, his, friends, and, above, all, his, wife, natalia, sedova, for, their, loyal, support, in, addition, to, the, happiness, of, being, a, fighter, for, the, cause, of, socialism, fate, gave, me, the, happiness, of, being, her, husband, during, the, almost, forty, years, of, our, life, together, she, remained, an, inexhaustible, source, of, love, magnanimity, and, tenderness, she, underwent, great, sufferings, especially, in, the, last, period, of, our, lives, but, i, find, some, comfort, in, the, fact, that, she, also, knew, days, of, happiness, for, forty, three, years, of, my, conscious, life, i, have, remained, a, revolutionist, for, forty, two, of, them, i, have, fought, under, the, banner, of, marxism, if, i, had, to, begin, all, over, again, i, would, of, course, try, to, avoid, this, or, that, mistake, but, the, main, course, of, my, life, would, remain, unchanged, i, shall, die, a, proletarian, revolutionist, a, marxist, a, dialectical, materialist, and, consequently, an, irreconcilable, atheist, my, faith, in, the, communist, future, of, mankind, is, not, less, ardent, indeed, it, is, firmer, today, than, it, was, in, the, days, of, my, youth, natasha, has, just, come, up, to, the, window, from, the, courtyard, and, opened, it, wider, so, that, the, air, may, enter, more, freely, into, my, room, i, can, see, the, bright, green, strip, of, grass, beneath, the, wall, and, the, clear, blue, sky, above, the, wall, and, sunlight, everywhere, life, is, beautiful, let, the, future, generations, cleanse, it, of, all, evil, oppression, and, violence, and, enjoy, it, to, the, full, l, trotsky, 27, february, 1940, coyoac, n, after, a, failed, attempt, to, have, trotsky, murdered, in, march, 1939, stalin, assigned, the, overall, organization, of, implementing, the, task, to, the, nkvd, officer, pavel, sudoplatov, who, in, turn, co, opted, nahum, eitingon, according, to, sudoplatov, s, special, tasks, the, nkvd, proceeded, to, set, up, three, nkvd, agent, networks, to, carry, out, the, murder, these, three, networks, were, designed, to, operate, entirely, autonomously, from, the, nkvd, s, hitherto, established, spy, networks, in, the, u, s, and, mexico, on, 24, may, 1940, trotsky, survived, a, raid, on, his, villa, by, armed, assassins, led, by, the, nkvd, agent, iosif, grigulevich, and, mexican, painter, david, alfaro, siqueiros, trotsky, s, 14, year, old, grandson, vsevolod, platonovich, esteban, volkov, 7, march, 1926, 16, june, 2023, was, shot, in, the, foot, a, young, assistant, and, bodyguard, of, trotsky, robert, sheldon, harte, disappeared, with, the, attackers, and, was, later, found, murdered, it, is, probable, that, he, was, an, accomplice, who, granted, them, access, to, the, villa, trotsky, s, other, guards, fended, off, the, attackers, following, the, failed, assassination, attempt, trotsky, wrote, an, article, titled, stalin, seeks, my, death, on, 8, june, 1940, in, which, he, stated, that, another, assassination, attempt, was, certain, on, 20, august, 1940, trotsky, was, attacked, in, his, study, by, spanish, born, nkvd, agent, ram, n, mercader, who, used, an, ice, axe, as, a, weapon, the, operation, was, known, within, the, nkvd, as, operation, utka, operation, duck, a, mountaineering, ice, axe, has, a, narrow, end, called, the, pick, and, a, flat, wide, end, called, the, adze, the, adze, of, the, axe, wounded, trotsky, fracturing, his, parietal, bone, and, penetrating, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, into, his, brain, the, blow, to, his, head, was, bungled, and, failed, to, kill, trotsky, instantly, witnesses, stated, that, trotsky, spat, on, mercader, and, began, struggling, fiercely, with, him, which, resulted, in, mercader, s, hand, being, broken, hearing, the, commotion, trotsky, s, bodyguards, burst, into, the, room, and, nearly, beat, mercader, to, death, but, trotsky, stopped, them, laboriously, stating, that, the, assassin, should, be, made, to, answer, questions, trotsky, was, then, taken, to, a, hospital, and, operated, on, surviving, for, more, than, a, day, yet, ultimately, dying, at, the, age, of, 60, on, the, 21st, of, august, 1940, from, blood, loss, and, shock, mercader, later, testified, at, his, trial, i, laid, my, raincoat, on, the, table, in, such, a, way, as, to, be, able, to, remove, the, ice, axe, which, was, in, the, pocket, i, decided, not, to, miss, the, wonderful, opportunity, that, presented, itself, the, moment, trotsky, began, reading, the, article, he, gave, me, my, chance, i, took, out, the, ice, axe, from, the, raincoat, gripped, it, in, my, hand, and, with, my, eyes, closed, dealt, him, a, terrible, blow, on, the, head, according, to, james, cannon, the, trotskyist, secretary, of, the, american, socialist, workers, party, trotsky, s, last, words, were, i, will, not, survive, this, attack, stalin, has, finally, accomplished, the, task, he, attempted, unsuccessfully, before, mercader, was, tried, and, convicted, of, the, murder, and, spent, the, next, 20, years, in, a, mexican, prison, stalin, wrote, that, the, assassin, of, trotsky, was, a, dangerous, trotskyist, this, is, why, mercader, had, no, awards, initially, though, his, mother, was, presented, with, the, order, of, lenin, for, her, own, part, of, the, operation, ram, n, mercader, could, not, be, either, assassinated, or, freed, from, prison, by, the, soviets, when, he, was, released, from, jail, in, 1960, and, arrived, in, the, ussr, in, 1961, leonid, brezhnev, signed, a, sentence, to, award, mercader, the, order, of, lenin, the, gold, star, and, the, title, of, the, hero, of, the, soviet, union, for, the, special, deed, the, kgb, boss, alexander, shelepin, presented, all, these, awards, to, ram, n, mercader, in, person, in, the, aftermath, of, trotsky, s, assassination, an, estimated, 300, 000, people, had, passed, by, his, funeral, casket, in, mexico, city, over, several, days, by, 27, august, 1940, trotsky, was, regarded, as, an, outstanding, orator, preeminent, theoretician, and, organiser, that, in, the, view, of, historian, michael, kort, forged, and, directed, the, red, army, he, served, as, one, of, the, original, politburo, members, in, lenin, s, government, biographer, isaac, deutscher, considered, him, to, be, the, prompter, of, planned, economy, and, industrialization, during, the, early, years, of, the, soviet, union, historian, laura, engelstein, judged, trotsky, to, be, personally, fastidious, but, possessing, the, qualities, of, vanity, and, volatility, which, were, not, shared, with, lenin, engelstein, also, described, him, as, talented, and, dynamic, but, only, a, second, in, command, political, theorist, ernest, mandel, summarised, the, dominant, image, of, trotsky, as, self, confident, unshakeable, in, the, conviction, of, his, historic, mission, strict, with, others, and, himself, and, indifferent, to, material, privileges, and, to, the, small, joys, and, sorrows, of, life, mandel, argued, this, image, reflected, certain, aspects, of, trotsky, s, personality, strengths, and, weaknesses, historian, simon, sebag, montefiore, described, trotsky, as, the, genius, of, the, revolution, and, biographer, dmitri, volkogonov, characterised, him, as, a, vivid, complex, multi, faceted, personality, in, the, gallery, of, world, figures, who, was, remembered, with, hatred, and, respect, anger, and, admiration, decades, after, his, assassination, in, mexico, volkogonov, also, found, trotsky, to, be, a, constant, spectre, for, stalin, after, his, exile, and, also, wrote, that, he, was, of, a, different, calibre, intellectually, with, his, grasp, of, organization, and, his, talents, as, a, speaker, and, writer, volkogonov, considered, trotsky, far, superior, to, figures, such, as, molotov, kaganovich, khrushchev, zhdanov, and, also, superior, to, stalin, and, stalin, knew, it, biographer, robert, service, commented, that, he, was, a, volatile, and, untrustworthy, arrogant, individual, that, impressed, supporters, even, during, the, periods, of, personal, adversity, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, but, failed, to, coax, and, encourage, them, to, the, full, service, stated, that, trotsky, gave, the, minimum, time, to, the, jewish, question, and, believed, that, he, ceased, to, be, a, jew, in, any, important, sense, because, marxism, had, burned, out, the, fortuitous, residues, of, his, origins, political, scientist, august, nimtz, regarded, trotsky, to, have, had, better, foresight, than, both, marxist, and, some, non, marxist, intellectual, observers, with, his, work, the, revolution, betrayed, what, is, the, soviet, union, and, where, is, it, going, 1936, trotsky, argued, that, the, stalinist, regime, was, an, ephemeral, phenomenon, and, nimtz, believed, this, had, later, been, proven, with, the, soviet, collapse, after, 1989, other, scholars, have, similarly, described, trotsky, as, having, a, prescient, judgement, of, events, such, as, the, stalinist, alliance, with, the, kuomintang, the, rise, of, nazi, germany, and, the, spanish, civil, war, through, his, political, writings, and, levels, of, military, accuracy, deutscher, also, referenced, his, uncanny, clear, sightedness, in, predicting, the, emergence, of, a, single, dictator, who, would, substitute, himself, for, the, central, committee, the, party, and, the, working, class, trotsky, was, a, marxist, intellectual, russian, historian, vladimir, buldakov, considered, trotsky, in, some, respect, a, typical, representative, of, russia, s, radical, intelligentsia, who, had, elements, of, bourgeois, origin, he, had, a, diverse, and, profound, range, of, interests, which, exceeded, that, of, other, bolshevik, theoreticians, such, as, nikolai, bukharin, he, also, had, a, notable, interest, in, literature, and, wrote, on, everyday, life, and, cultural, progress, as, well, as, on, the, more, customary, marxism, of, the, day, trotsky, and, his, second, wife, natalia, sedova, enjoyed, viennese, galleries, and, made, frequent, visits, to, museums, such, as, the, louvre, and, the, tate, gallery, across, europe, to, view, specific, art, collections, he, also, retained, a, personal, interest, in, science, which, stemmed, from, his, youth, when, he, considered, studying, mathematics, and, physics, at, the, new, russian, university, in, odessa, his, personal, secretary, and, later, a, historian, of, mathematical, logic, jean, van, heijenoort, considered, him, to, be, amicable, inquisitive, and, occasionally, charming, with, new, acquaintances, during, his, final, years, in, mexico, old, bolshevik, anatoly, lunacharsky, viewed, trotsky, as, the, best, prepared, among, the, social, democratic, leaders, during, the, 1905, 1907, revolution, and, stated, that, he, emerged, from, the, revolution, having, acquired, an, enormous, degree, of, popularity, whereas, neither, lenin, nor, martov, had, effectively, gained, any, at, all, his, arch, enemy, stalin, even, read, and, sometimes, appreciated, a, great, deal, of, his, writings, according, to, rubenstein, stalin, had, even, acknowledged, that, after, lenin, trotsky, was, the, most, popular, figure, in, the, country, at, the, end, of, the, civil, war, he, also, recognized, the, prominent, role, of, trotsky, during, the, october, revolution, in, the, 1917, pravda, editorial, stalin, himself, wrote, all, practical, work, in, connection, with, the, organization, of, the, uprising, was, done, under, the, immediate, direction, of, comrade, trotsky, the, president, of, the, petrograd, soviet, upon, his, exile, in, 1929, eighteen, of, his, close, relatives, remained, in, the, soviet, union, and, all, were, subjected, to, repressive, measures, with, seven, of, his, family, members, including, his, son, sergei, sedov, sister, olga, kameneva, and, brother, aleksandr, bronstein, having, been, shot, he, spoke, several, european, languages, with, a, markedly, russian, accent, and, identified, as, a, cosmopolitan, and, internationalist, in, the, course, of, his, life, trotsky, wrote, about, 30, 000, documents, most, of, which, are, contained, in, various, archives, deutscher, stated, that, trotsky, wrote, most, of, the, soviet, s, manifestos, and, resolutions, edited, its, izvestia, newspaper, and, also, composed, the, oath, of, loyalty, for, the, red, army, according, to, mandel, trotsky, wrote, the, zimmerwald, manifesto, for, the, zimmerwald, conference, because, he, was, radically, opposed, to, world, war, i, and, drafted, the, appeal, for, the, convocation, of, the, first, comintern, congress, due, to, his, active, involvement, with, the, third, international, he, also, served, as, a, member, of, the, executive, committee, of, the, communist, international, for, the, initial, congress, sessions, aside, from, his, interest, in, political, activism, trotsky, also, worked, as, a, statistician, and, a, journalist, trotsky, stated, that, he, worked, for, three, newspapers, and, oversaw, the, russian, gazette, with, alexander, parvus, he, claimed, that, the, circulation, under, his, tenure, had, increased, from, 30, 000, to, 500, 000, however, historians, anthony, heywood, and, jonathan, smele, believe, this, was, an, exaggerated, claim, and, cited, circulation, figures, from, the, editors, of, trotsky, s, collected, works, that, the, figures, had, in, fact, increased, to, 100, 000, which, they, still, regarded, as, impressive, and, comparatively, ahead, of, lenin, s, new, life, newspaper, by, 20, 000, had, trotsky, won, the, struggle, to, succeed, lenin, the, character, of, the, soviet, regime, would, almost, certainly, have, been, substantially, different, particularly, in, foreign, policy, cultural, policy, and, the, extent, of, terroristic, repression, trotsky, s, failure, however, seems, to, have, been, almost, inevitable, considering, his, own, qualities, and, the, conditions, of, authoritarian, rule, by, the, communist, party, organization, historian, robert, vincent, daniels, 1993, historian, robert, vincent, daniels, expressed, the, view, that, trotsky, was, undoubtedly, the, most, brilliant, intellect, brought, to, prominence, by, the, russian, revolution, outdistancing, lenin, and, other, theoreticians, both, in, the, range, of, his, interests, and, in, the, imaginativeness, of, his, perceptions, yet, he, emphasised, his, personal, arrogance, as, an, underlying, weakness, which, antagonised, other, members, of, the, communist, movement, daniels, also, argued, that, had, trotsky, assumed, the, role, of, lenin, s, successor, then, he, would, have, presided, over, an, alternate, soviet, union, markedly, distinct, from, stalin, s, regime, contrarily, service, asserted, that, the, succession, of, trotsky, would, have, resulted, in, a, similar, totalitarian, dictatorship, akin, to, stalin, s, rule, and, increased, the, likelihood, of, conflict, across, the, european, continent, although, historian, sheila, fitzpatrick, found, it, implausible, that, trotsky, like, stalin, would, have, launched, an, anti, semitic, campaign, after, world, war, ii, or, initiated, the, great, purge, rather, she, suggested, trotsky, would, presumably, have, provided, good, leadership, during, the, second, world, war, but, may, have, struggled, to, maintain, party, cohesion, as, seen, during, the, succession, struggle, after, 1924, political, theorist, david, north, argued, that, trotsky, s, military, policies, would, have, averted, the, dismantlement, of, soviet, defenses, alongside, the, high, levels, of, human, casualties, associated, with, operation, barbarossa, and, the, second, world, war, biographer, geoffrey, swain, believed, that, the, soviet, union, under, the, leadership, of, trotsky, would, have, been, more, technocratic, as, he, would, have, made, far, more, use, of, bourgeois, experts, the, planning, process, and, inferred, this, from, his, conduct, during, the, civil, war, along, with, his, writings, in, the, early, 1920s, other, scholars, have, pointed, to, the, fact, that, trotsky, opposed, the, policy, of, forced, collectivisation, under, stalin, and, favoured, a, voluntary, gradual, approach, towards, agricultural, production, as, an, area, of, differentiation, his, enmity, with, stalin, developed, during, the, civil, war, with, the, latter, s, disregard, of, military, specialists, whom, trotsky, considered, indispensable, for, the, success, of, the, red, army, in, tsaritsyn, stalin, ordered, the, imprisonment, of, several, specialists, on, a, barge, in, the, volga, river, and, oversaw, the, sinking, of, the, floating, prison, in, which, the, officers, perished, another, instance, was, when, stalin, disobeyed, trotsky, s, order, to, march, on, warsaw, which, contributed, to, the, defeat, of, the, red, army, at, the, battle, of, warsaw, in, 1920, bazhanov, also, claimed, that, stalin, s, antagonism, towards, trotsky, stemmed, from, the, fact, that, he, was, jewish, and, that, the, former, would, refuse, to, obey, military, orders, during, the, russian, civil, war, according, to, rogovin, trotsky, received, hundreds, of, letters, reporting, the, use, of, anti, semitic, methods, during, the, inter, party, struggle, between, stalin, and, the, united, opposition, trotsky, lacked, the, political, acumen, to, succeed, against, stalin, s, machinations, lenin, had, encouraged, trotsky, in, his, absence, to, challenge, stalin, at, the, twelfth, party, congress, over, the, georgian, affair, but, the, latter, relented, historian, peter, kenez, believed, that, trotsky, could, probably, have, removed, stalin, with, the, use, of, lenin, s, testament, but, he, stupidly, acquiesced, to, the, collective, decision, not, to, publish, the, document, historian, martin, mccauley, commented, that, trotsky, displayed, a, lamentable, lack, of, political, judgement, on, multiple, occasions, such, as, declining, lenin, s, proposal, to, become, deputy, chairman, of, sovnarkom, failing, to, build, a, power, base, before, forming, a, bloc, with, lenin, against, the, orgburo, and, not, immediately, recognising, that, a, triumvirate, had, been, established, to, prevent, his, succession, rubenstein, differed, in, his, interpretation, and, attributed, trotsky, s, decision, to, decline, lenin, s, proposal, because, he, believed, the, position, had, little, authority, of, its, own, and, overlapped, with, other, government, and, party, officials, deutscher, believed, he, had, underestimated, stalin, s, cunning, ruthlessness, and, tenacity, on, several, occasions, political, scientist, richard, b, day, argued, that, it, was, more, probable, that, trotsky, s, interest, in, building, socialism, outweighed, his, desire, for, personal, power, with, all, the, greater, frankness, can, i, state, how, in, my, view, the, soviet, government, should, act, in, case, of, a, fascist, upheaval, in, germany, in, their, place, i, would, at, the, very, moment, of, receiving, telegraphic, news, of, this, event, sign, a, mobilisation, order, calling, up, several, age, groups, in, the, face, of, a, mortal, enemy, when, the, logic, of, the, situation, points, to, inevitable, war, it, would, be, irresponsible, and, unpardonable, to, give, that, enemy, time, to, establish, himself, to, consolidate, his, positions, to, conclude, alliances, and, to, work, out, the, plan, to, attack, trotsky, describing, the, military, measures, he, would, have, taken, in, place, of, stalin, to, counter, the, rise, of, nazi, germany, in, 1932, historian, orlando, figes, noted, that, trotsky, never, held, a, party, post, and, rarely, attended, party, meetings, despite, serving, as, a, member, of, the, politburo, figes, also, described, him, as, having, too, many, characteristics, that, made, it, extraordinarily, hard, to, work, collectively, with, him, biographer, joshua, rubenstein, regarded, trotsky, s, position, among, the, soviet, elites, as, largely, dependent, on, lenin, rubenstein, also, added, that, he, had, an, image, of, an, outsider, within, party, circles, as, he, had, previously, been, an, outspoken, critic, of, lenin, conversely, volkongov, stated, that, trotsky, had, the, support, of, many, party, intellectuals, but, this, was, overshadowed, by, the, huge, apparatus, which, included, the, gpu, and, the, party, cadres, who, were, at, the, disposal, of, stalin, historian, paul, dukes, considered, it, a, debatable, notion, that, his, personal, sophistication, as, a, political, figure, led, to, his, defeat, in, the, great, struggle, of, 1923, and, after, he, also, reached, the, view, that, trotsky, did, not, share, stalin, s, understanding, of, the, party, in, which, fewer, than, 10, percent, of, its, members, were, fully, literate, and, this, was, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, stalin, was, a, man, of, narrower, outlook, in, virtually, every, respect, trotsky, himself, ascribed, his, political, defeat, to, external, objective, conditions, rather, than, the, individual, qualities, of, stalin, he, specifically, argued, that, the, failed, series, of, international, insurrections, as, seen, in, bulgaria, in, 1923, and, china, in, 1927, had, diminished, the, prospect, of, world, socialism, and, demoralised, the, russian, working, class, which, in, turn, strengthened, the, growth, of, an, internal, soviet, bureaucracy, russian, historian, vadim, rogovin, also, remarked, that, trotsky, in, the, 1930s, did, not, abandon, hope, for, the, spread, of, the, revolution, rogovin, argued, that, trotsky, s, prognosis, of, world, events, was, plausible, as, a, majority, of, european, countries, such, as, germany, france, and, especially, spain, went, through, a, period, of, revolutionary, crisis, although, daniels, contended, that, trotsky, would, have, in, reality, been, no, more, prepared, than, other, bolshevik, figures, to, risk, war, or, the, loss, of, trade, opportunities, despite, his, support, for, world, revolution, his, relations, with, lenin, have, been, a, source, of, intense, historical, debate, historian, paul, le, blanc, and, philosopher, michael, lowy, described, lenin, and, trotsky, as, the, widely, leading, figures, in, the, russia, s, bolshevik, revolution, of, 1917, as, well, as, in, the, final, years, of, the, rising, world, communist, movement, they, characterized, lenin, and, trotsky, as, fierce, adversaries, during, the, early, years, of, the, russian, socialist, movement, but, described, the, duo, as, having, reached, a, convergence, and, a, substantial, agreement, in, 1917, before, colluding, their, efforts, to, achieve, the, october, revolution, they, also, highlighted, the, mutual, appreciation, and, respect, between, lenin, and, trotsky, with, the, former, seeking, to, work, closely, with, trotsky, on, the, iskra, newspaper, prior, to, their, polemical, disagreements, and, lenin, acknowledging, that, his, theory, on, permanent, revolution, happened, to, be, right, after, 1917, however, swain, viewed, the, notion, that, trotsky, was, lenin, s, natural, heir, a, myth, and, cited, several, scholars, such, as, erik, van, rees, james, white, and, richard, b, day, who, swain, claimed, had, challenged, the, traditional, characterization, of, their, relationship, north, specifically, rejected, this, position, and, argued, swain, sought, to, discredit, historical, works, appreciative, of, trotsky, north, continued, to, argue, that, swain, gave, an, insufficient, consideration, of, the, complex, historical, political, social, and, theoretical, issues, that, arise, in, any, serious, study, of, the, lenin, trotsky, relationship, he, also, asserted, that, swain, had, distorted, and, misrepresented, the, positions, of, the, cited, scholars, le, blanc, also, disputed, swain, s, representation, of, trotsky, and, referenced, various, historians, which, included, e, h, carr, isaac, deutscher, moshe, lewin, ronald, suny, and, w, bruce, lincoln, across, different, generations, according, to, le, blanc, these, historians, on, balance, had, tilted, toward, the, view, that, lenin, s, desired, heir, was, collective, responsibility, in, which, trotsky, placed, an, important, role, and, within, which, stalin, would, be, dramatically, demoted, if, not, removed, similarly, historian, roy, medvedev, noted, the, close, association, of, trotsky, and, lenin, in, the, soviet, republic, throughout, the, period, of, 1921, 24, medvedev, mentioned, a, number, of, public, commendations, such, as, greetings, in, honour, of, comrades, lenin, and, trotsky, were, announced, at, many, rallies, and, meetings, and, portraits, of, lenin, and, trotsky, hung, on, the, walls, of, many, soviet, and, party, institutions, initially, lenin, turned, down, the, leading, position, of, chairman, of, the, council, of, people, s, commissars, when, the, bolsheviks, formed, a, new, government, after, the, october, revolution, in, 1917, and, suggested, trotsky, for, the, position, however, trotsky, refused, the, position, and, other, bolsheviks, insisted, that, lenin, assume, principal, responsibility, which, thereafter, resulted, in, lenin, eventually, accepting, the, role, of, chairman, on, a, separate, occasion, lenin, expressed, hostility, to, the, early, attempts, by, the, triumvirate, to, remove, trotsky, from, the, leadership, in, a, 1922, memo, written, to, kamenev, he, chastised, the, efforts, by, the, central, committee, to, throw, trotsky, overboard, as, the, height, of, stupidity, if, you, do, not, consider, me, already, hopelessly, foolish, how, can, you, think, of, that, in, his, last, testament, lenin, urged, the, wider, party, circles, to, not, use, and, hold, trotsky, s, non, bolshevik, past, against, him, soviet, writer, maxim, gorky, recollected, lenin, in, the, first, version, of, his, sketch, v, i, lenin, dismissing, rumours, of, an, alleged, political, difference, between, himself, and, trotsky, with, the, words, there, are, many, lies, and, it, seems, particularly, many, lies, about, me, and, trotsky, gorky, also, stated, that, lenin, made, an, approving, assessment, of, trotsky, due, to, his, military, organisation, of, the, army, in, a, single, year, in, the, view, of, lenin, s, wife, nadezhda, krupskaya, lenin, was, pleased, with, the, definite, manner, of, trotsky, s, theoretical, comprehension, of, diverging, russian, revolutionary, movements, during, their, first, meeting, in, 1902, she, similarly, expressed, this, view, in, a, personal, note, after, lenin, s, death, that, her, husband, s, attitude, towards, trotsky, had, not, changed, until, his, death, since, their, initial, meeting, in, london, in, his, final, months, lenin, read, several, of, trotsky, s, works, among, a, wider, collection, of, books, which, interested, him, lenin, read, problems, of, everyday, life, in, the, last, month, of, his, life, and, instructed, krupskaya, to, read, him, a, passage, from, another, of, trotsky, s, books, that, characterised, marxism, and, leninism, lenin, also, read, trotsky, s, pamphlet, the, new, course, on, the, day, prior, to, his, death, according, to, stalin, s, secretary, boris, bazhanov, lenin, in, general, leaned, towards, a, collegial, leadership, with, trotsky, in, the, first, position, comrade, trotsky, on, the, other, hand, as, his, struggle, against, the, c, c, on, the, question, of, the, people, s, commissariat, of, communications, has, already, proved, is, distinguished, not, only, by, outstanding, ability, he, is, personally, perhaps, the, most, capable, man, in, the, present, c, c, but, he, has, displayed, excessive, self, assurance, and, shown, excessive, preoccupation, with, the, purely, administrative, side, of, the, work, lenin, s, testament, 1923, most, historians, consider, the, document, to, be, an, accurate, reflection, of, lenin, s, views, trotsky, was, generally, viewed, as, lenin, s, choice, as, a, successor, in, 1923, he, had, been, nominated, to, be, lenin, s, deputy, in, 1922, and, 1923, as, well, as, expected, to, assume, responsibility, over, the, council, of, national, economy, or, gosplan, lenin, and, trotsky, were, also, the, only, soviet, leaders, elected, honorary, presidents, of, the, communist, international, prior, to, the, introduction, of, the, factional, ban, in, 1921, due, to, intra, party, controversies, and, the, wider, conflict, of, the, civil, war, trotsky, had, a, considerable, following, among, the, party, activists, and, members, of, the, central, committee, against, the, narrow, majority, supporting, lenin, his, supporters, also, controlled, the, newly, established, orgburo, and, the, party, secretariat, before, the, appointment, of, stalin, as, general, secretary, according, to, mccauley, lenin, had, revealed, that, he, planned, to, retire, to, the, central, committee, and, made, an, arrangement, for, trotsky, to, speak, on, his, behalf, as, his, natural, successor, which, in, turn, triggered, the, formation, of, the, troika, forges, drew, focus, to, the, increasing, alignment, between, lenin, and, trotsky, in, 1923, he, cited, lenin, s, testament, which, was, critical, of, stalin, and, the, bureaucracy, along, with, their, shared, position, on, foreign, trade, party, reform, and, the, georgian, affair, rogovin, interpreted, lenin, s, proposal, to, the, politburo, that, trotsky, be, confirmed, as, the, first, deputy, chairman, of, the, council, of, the, sovnarkom, as, signifying, that, he, was, entrusted, with, the, highest, government, post, and, he, argued, that, this, was, also, considerable, given, lenin, s, illness, at, the, time, rogovin, also, referenced, a, previous, proposal, by, lenin, in, 1917, to, appoint, trotsky, with, another, senior, position, as, people, s, commissar, of, internal, affairs, yet, historian, richard, pipes, dismissed, the, view, that, trotsky, was, lenin, s, successor, due, to, his, proposed, and, joint, appointment, as, deputy, chairman, with, kamenev, in, 1922, pipes, attributed, this, overstated, claim, to, trotsky, s, supporters, and, explained, that, he, had, in, fact, been, reprimanded, by, the, party, for, categorically, refusing, the, post, conversely, medvedev, stated, that, trotsky, undoubtedly, would, have, been, first, among, lenin, s, deputies, given, his, authority, in, 1922, and, noted, that, kamenev, lacked, any, personal, desire, to, become, chairman, upon, lenin, s, death, slavic, studies, scholar, derek, watson, presumed, that, trotsky, would, have, been, the, first, vice, chairman, of, an, additional, rsfsr, body, working, alongside, the, other, deputies, deutscher, argued, that, had, trotsky, assumed, the, post, of, deputy, then, it, would, have, been, difficult, for, rykov, to, have, been, promoted, above, him, as, chairman, after, lenin, s, death, in, 1924, polish, historian, marian, kamil, dziewanowski, also, echoed, these, views, and, argued, that, had, trotsky, accepted, the, post, of, vice, chairman, then, his, prestige, and, power, would, have, been, strengthened, as, a, counter, weight, to, stalin, s, growing, influence, dziewanowski, expressed, the, view, that, trotsky, as, vice, chairman, would, have, been, a, natural, successor, to, lenin, as, chairman, of, the, soviet, union, however, his, rejection, of, the, position, enabled, stalin, to, place, rykov, as, lenin, s, successor, and, serve, as, a, key, ally, in, the, politburo, against, trotsky, similarly, soviet, historian, victor, danilov, believed, that, lenin, s, proposed, appointment, of, trotsky, as, deputy, would, have, made, him, in, effect, lenin, s, successor, danilov, also, cited, politburo, secretary, bazhanov, s, notes, of, a, concluding, speech, delivered, by, trotsky, in, 1923, to, the, wider, party, membership, trotsky, explained, his, decision, to, decline, the, proposed, position, of, lenin, s, chief, deputy, due, to, concerns, about, his, jewish, origins, which, could, accentuate, anti, semitic, attitudes, towards, the, soviet, union, mccauley, stated, that, trotsky, would, almost, certainly, have, become, the, successor, had, lenin, succumbed, to, his, first, stroke, in, 1922, deutscher, noted, that, zinoviev, had, been, lenin, s, closest, discipline, rather, than, trotsky, between, 1907, and, 1917, however, zinoviev, s, opposition, to, the, october, revolution, had, strained, his, relations, with, lenin, opponents, such, as, winston, churchill, even, argued, that, lenin, indeed, regarded, trotsky, as, his, political, heir, and, sought, to, protect, him, before, his, passing, in, 1924, zinoviev, and, kamenev, also, viewed, trotsky, as, lenin, s, most, likely, successor, and, sided, with, stalin, out, of, fear, that, trotsky, would, remove, them, from, the, party, leadership, however, his, chief, adversary, stalin, strongly, denied, claims, that, trotsky, was, the, succeeding, chairman, following, lenin, s, illness, he, pointed, out, that, trotsky, was, expected, to, serve, as, one, of, several, deputy, chairmen, under, lenin, which, included, kamenev, rykov, and, tsiurupa, although, he, did, reference, a, written, document, signed, by, lenin, in, 1922, which, assigned, trotsky, and, kamenev, different, areas, of, focus, as, deputy, chairmen, lenin, s, authorised, document, proposed, trotsky, as, deputy, chairman, of, the, council, of, commissars, rather, than, kamenev, who, was, intended, to, serve, only, as, a, deputy, chairman, of, the, labour, defence, council, on, lenin, s, initiative, stalin, requested, the, central, committee, that, trotsky, be, appointed, deputy, chairman, and, chairman, of, gosplan, in, january, 1923, but, he, refused, the, position, in, his, autobiography, my, life, trotsky, maintained, that, lenin, had, intended, for, him, to, be, his, successor, as, chairman, of, the, soviet, union, with, his, proposed, appointment, as, deputy, he, explained, that, this, process, would, have, begun, after, their, alliance, in, 1923, with, the, formation, of, a, commission, to, mitigate, the, growth, of, the, state, bureaucracy, which, in, turn, would, have, facilitated, the, conditions, for, his, succession, in, the, party, in, 1923, the, historic, town, of, gatchina, in, petrograd, governorate, now, leningrad, oblast, was, renamed, trotsk, russian, by, the, soviet, authorities, after, lev, trotsky, after, joseph, stalin, became, general, secretary, of, the, russian, communist, party, b, trotsky, was, gradually, exiled, and, the, town, was, renamed, krasnogvardeysk, red, guard, city, in, 1929, in, 1944, to, increase, the, morale, of, russian, troops, the, town, s, historic, name, was, restored, trotsky, s, house, in, coyoac, n, has, been, preserved, in, much, the, same, condition, as, it, was, on, the, day, he, was, assassinated, there, and, is, now, the, leon, trotsky, house, museum, in, mexico, city, run, by, a, board, which, included, his, grandson, esteban, volkov, 1926, 2023, trotsky, s, grave, is, located, on, its, grounds, the, foundation, international, friends, of, the, leon, trotsky, museum, has, been, organized, to, raise, funds, to, improve, the, museum, further, shortly, before, his, assassination, trotsky, agreed, to, sell, the, bulk, of, the, papers, he, still, had, to, harvard, university, after, his, assassination, his, widow, natalya, sedova, collected, his, remaining, papers, and, shipped, them, to, harvard, and, in, the, years, following, harvard, managed, to, collect, additional, papers, that, had, been, hidden, from, both, soviet, and, nazi, agents, in, europe, these, papers, now, occupy, 65, feet, 20, m, of, shelf, space, in, harvard, s, houghton, library, trotsky, was, never, rehabilitated, during, the, rule, of, the, soviet, government, despite, the, de, stalinization, era, rehabilitation, of, most, other, old, bolsheviks, killed, during, the, great, purges, his, son, sergei, sedov, who, died, in, 1937, was, rehabilitated, in, 1988, as, was, nikolai, bukharin, beginning, in, 1989, trotsky, s, books, forbidden, until, 1987, were, published, in, the, soviet, union, trotsky, was, rehabilitated, on, 16, june, 2001, by, the, general, prosecutor, s, office, of, the, russian, federation, certificates, of, rehabilitation, no, 13, 2182, 90, no, 13, 2200, 99, in, archives, research, center, memorial, trinidadian, historian, clr, james, wrote, in, the, aftermath, of, trotsky, s, death, that, he, evoked, strong, feelings, of, enmity, and, fear, from, several, political, figures, according, to, james, this, included, joseph, stalin, adolf, hitler, and, winston, churchill, because, these, men, knew, his, stature, the, power, of, what, he, stood, for, and, were, never, lulled, by, the, smallness, of, his, forces, historian, harold, shukman, assessed, the, conflicting, perspectives, on, trotsky, s, legacy, in, the, soviet, union, and, the, western, world, he, also, commented, on, the, lack, of, a, balanced, view, specifically, he, stated, trotsky, s, legacy, unlike, those, of, stalin, and, lenin, had, long, been, submerged, and, obliterated, as, a, topic, of, debate, and, his, place, in, soviet, history, books, had, correspondingly, diminished, to, one, of, no, importance, for, western, readers, however, trotsky, has, always, been, one, of, the, most, enigmatic, and, powerful, personalities, of, the, russian, revolution, a, mephistophelian, figure, whose, life, ended, in, an, appropriately, dramatic, way, political, theorist, david, north, attributed, his, diminished, influence, and, historical, role, to, the, virtually, unlimited, resources, of, the, soviet, regime, and, of, stalinist, run, parties, throughout, the, world, were, devoted, to, blackguarding, trotsky, as, an, anti, soviet, saboteur, terrorist, and, fascist, agent, within, the, soviet, union, his, political, co, thinkers, past, and, present, were, ruthlessly, exterminated, north, was, also, critical, of, the, biographical, literature, on, trotsky, s, legacy, written, by, some, historians, such, as, ian, thatcher, geoffrey, swain, and, robert, service, he, viewed, these, recent, trends, in, historiography, as, manifestations, of, the, confluence, of, neo, stalinist, falsification, and, traditional, anglo, american, anti, communism, in, 2018, john, kelly, wrote, that, almost, 80, years, after, leon, trotsky, founded, the, fourth, international, there, are, now, trotskyite, organisations, in, 57, countries, including, most, of, western, europe, and, latin, america, however, he, also, argued, that, no, trotskyite, group, had, ever, led, a, revolution, or, built, an, enduring, mass, political, party, robert, alexander, made, a, similar, observation, in, 1991, that, trotskyists, had, never, assumed, power, in, any, nation, but, explained, that, the, international, movement, did, not, enjoy, the, support, of, a, well, established, regime, as, did, the, heirs, of, stalinism, alexander, also, recognised, that, the, persistence, of, the, movement, in, a, wide, variety, of, countries, and, the, instability, of, political, events, across, most, of, the, world, means, the, possibility, that, a, trotskyist, party, might, come, to, power, in, the, foreseeable, future, cannot, be, totally, ruled, out, on, the, other, hand, british, historian, and, socialist, christian, h, gsbjerg, believed, that, academic, literature, on, trotskyism, had, minimised, its, historical, role, in, building, wider, social, movements, h, gsbjerg, stressed, the, key, role, of, british, trotskyists, in, various, movements, such, as, the, vietnam, solidarity, campaign, 1966, 71, the, anti, nazi, league, 1977, 81, the, anti, poll, tax, federation, 1989, 91, and, the, stop, the, war, coalition, 2001, outside, of, the, fourth, international, trotsky, has, also, been, admired, by, a, range, of, figures, across, intellectual, military, political, and, cultural, fields, including, philosopher, jean, paul, sartre, military, general, mikhail, tukhachevsky, marxist, theorist, rosa, luxemburg, economist, paul, sweezy, philosopher, john, dewey, historian, a, j, p, taylor, psychoanalyst, erich, fromm, philosopher, alasdair, macintyre, literary, critic, edmund, wilson, painter, diego, rivera, political, leader, martin, tranm, l, and, literary, writer, lu, xun, in, modern, historiography, trotsky, s, legacy, has, evoked, a, range, of, conflicting, and, diverse, views, biographer, paul, le, blanc, stated, for, millions, of, people, throughout, the, world, trotsky, was, initially, seen, as, a, revolutionary, liberator, he, was, viewed, by, contemporaries, in, the, initial, soviet, period, and, later, historians, as, the, hero, of, the, revolution, bolshevik, figures, such, as, anatoly, lunacharsky, moisei, uritsky, and, dmitry, manuilsky, agreed, that, lenin, s, influence, on, the, bolshevik, party, was, decisive, but, the, october, insurrection, was, carried, out, according, to, trotsky, s, not, to, lenin, s, plan, historian, betrand, patenaunde, also, noted, his, social, appeal, among, the, petrograd, workers, in, which, he, drew, vast, crowds, of, workers, soldiers, and, sailors, in, petrograd, with, his, spellbinding, oratory, in, 1917, in, the, soviet, union, his, reputation, gradually, deteriorated, over, the, course, of, the, succession, struggle, as, his, views, were, presented, as, sectarian, and, anti, leninist, throughout, the, stalin, era, his, name, and, image, would, be, erased, from, history, books, museums, and, films, at, the, same, time, trotsky, became, a, convenient, bogeyman, for, soviet, affairs, and, was, associated, with, ideological, heresy, the, works, of, trotsky, also, remained, banned, until, the, gorbachev, era, following, the, de, stalinization, period, later, generations, of, soviet, and, russian, historians, would, reevaluate, his, role, in, the, history, of, the, revolution, with, varying, interpretations, scholarly, consensus, holds, trotsky, to, have, demonstrated, remarkable, leadership, of, the, red, army, during, the, civil, war, he, had, been, awarded, the, order, of, the, red, banner, for, his, role, in, the, red, army, such, as, organising, the, defence, of, petrograd, when, other, members, of, the, bolshevik, leadership, were, prepared, to, abandon, the, former, capital, according, to, military, scholar, william, c, martel, scholars, view, trotsky, as, one, of, the, outstanding, figures, in, modern, military, history, and, a, directing, genius, swain, asserted, that, the, bolsheviks, would, certainly, have, lost, the, civil, war, within, a, single, year, without, trotsky, as, leader, of, the, red, army, a, number, of, scholars, and, western, socialists, have, argued, that, trotsky, represented, a, more, democratic, alternative, to, stalin, with, particular, emphasis, drawn, to, his, activities, in, the, pre, civil, war, period, and, as, leader, of, the, left, opposition, prior, to, the, october, revolution, trotsky, had, been, part, of, an, old, radical, democracy, which, included, both, left, mensheviks, and, left, bolsheviks, he, had, also, proposed, the, election, of, a, new, soviet, presidium, with, other, socialist, parties, on, the, basis, of, proportional, representation, in, september, 1917, deutscher, described, trotsky, as, the, soviet, s, moving, spirit, in, 1905, and, highlighted, his, representation, of, bolsheviks, mensheviks, and, the, rest, of, the, soviets, on, major, occasions, rogovin, stated, that, the, left, opposition, led, by, trotsky, was, a, political, movement, that, offered, a, real, alternative, to, stalinism, and, that, to, crush, this, movement, was, the, primary, function, of, the, stalinist, terror, he, also, attributed, the, eventual, formation, of, a, one, party, system, to, the, conditions, which, were, imposed, on, bolshevism, by, hostile, political, forces, conversely, other, figures, such, as, volkogonov, have, strongly, criticised, his, defence, of, the, red, terror, and, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, service, argued, that, his, ideas, and, practices, laid, several, foundation, stones, for, the, erection, of, the, stalinist, political, economic, social, and, even, cultural, edifice, cherniaev, considered, trotsky, to, be, partly, responsible, for, the, establishment, of, a, one, party, authoritarian, state, and, initiating, several, military, practices, such, as, summary, executions, which, later, became, standard, practice, during, the, stalinist, era, thatcher, cited, his, defence, of, terror, in, his, work, terrorism, and, communism, a, reply, to, karl, kautsky, but, also, acknowledged, that, trotsky, was, capable, of, leniency, and, had, personally, urged, that, white, army, deserters, be, treated, with, understanding, this, view, has, been, disputed, by, some, writers, such, as, french, socialist, historian, pierre, broue, who, criticised, western, representations, of, trotsky, s, role, in, the, kronstadt, rebellion, which, he, argued, had, falsely, presented, trotsky, as, the, principal, figure, that, led, and, was, responsible, for, the, repression, he, also, added, that, military, tribunals, and, executions, for, desertions, were, a, common, feature, of, every, war, and, not, exclusive, to, the, actions, of, the, red, army, under, trotsky, dukes, believed, trotsky, had, been, maligned, and, caricatured, as, a, historical, figure, which, necessitated, a, historical, reappraisal, patenaude, regarded, service, s, characterisation, of, trotsky, as, a, mass, murderer, and, a, terrorist, to, be, reflective, of, a, wider, attempt, to, discredit, trotsky, as, a, historical, figure, and, noted, his, work, featured, several, inaccuracies, and, distortions, of, the, historical, record, daniels, argued, that, many, of, the, distinctive, features, of, stalin, s, rule, such, as, his, campaigns, against, bourgeois, experts, as, seen, with, the, shakhty, trials, his, contemptuous, anti, intellectualism, and, the, dogmatization, of, marxism, the, purges, run, totally, counter, to, trotsky, s, thought, various, historians, have, credited, trotsky, and, the, left, opposition, with, shifting, the, soviet, economic, orientation, from, the, nep, policy, towards, a, planned, economy, through, their, proposals, for, mass, industrialization, trotsky, had, delivered, a, joint, report, to, the, april, plenum, of, the, central, committee, in, 1926, which, proposed, a, program, for, national, industrialization, and, the, replacement, of, annual, plans, with, five, year, plans, his, proposals, were, rejected, by, the, central, committee, majority, which, was, controlled, by, the, troika, and, derided, by, stalin, at, the, time, the, eventual, adoption, of, the, five, year, plans, in, 1928, would, serve, as, the, basis, for, soviet, modernization, on, the, whole, historian, mark, sandle, characterised, his, vision, for, socialist, construction, as, more, industrialist, modernist, centralising, and, technocratic, than, the, economic, proposals, presented, by, rival, theoretician, bukharin, several, scholars, have, regarded, his, historical, writings, on, the, soviet, bureaucracy, as, having, a, considerable, influence, in, shaping, the, receptive, attitudes, of, later, marxists, and, many, non, marxists, trotsky, associated, bureaucratism, with, authoritarianism, excessive, centralism, and, conservatism, political, scientist, baruch, knei, paz, argued, that, trotsky, had, done, more, than, any, other, political, figure, to, show, the, historical, and, social, roots, of, stalinism, as, a, bureaucratic, system, british, cybernetician, stafford, beer, who, worked, on, a, decentralized, form, of, economic, planning, project, cybersyn, from, 1970, to, 1973, was, reported, to, have, read, and, been, influenced, by, trotsky, s, critique, of, the, soviet, bureaucracy, other, historians, have, noted, the, literary, value, of, his, account, of, historical, events, and, social, analysis, with, works, such, as, 1905, and, the, history, of, the, russian, revolution, for, wider, historiography, trotsky, considered, himself, to, be, a, bolshevik, leninist, arguing, for, the, establishment, of, a, vanguard, party, he, viewed, himself, as, an, advocate, of, orthodox, marxism, trotsky, also, adhered, to, scientific, socialism, and, viewed, this, as, a, conscious, expression, of, historical, processes, his, politics, differed, in, some, aspects, from, those, of, stalin, or, mao, zedong, most, importantly, in, his, rejection, of, the, theory, of, socialism, in, one, country, and, his, declaring, of, the, need, for, an, international, permanent, revolution, numerous, fourth, internationalist, groups, around, the, world, continue, to, describe, themselves, as, trotskyists, and, see, themselves, as, standing, in, this, tradition, however, they, have, different, interpretations, of, the, conclusions, to, be, drawn, from, this, in, the, post, leninist, struggle, trotsky, and, the, left, united, opposition, had, advocated, for, a, programme, of, rapid, industrialization, voluntary, collectivisation, of, agriculture, and, the, expansion, of, a, worker, s, democracy, in, 1936, trotsky, called, for, the, restoration, of, the, right, of, criticism, in, areas, such, as, economic, matters, the, revitalization, of, trade, unions, and, free, elections, of, the, soviet, parties, supporters, of, the, fourth, international, echo, trotsky, s, opposition, to, stalinist, totalitarianism, advocating, political, revolution, and, arguing, that, socialism, cannot, sustain, itself, without, democracy, trotsky, was, an, early, proponent, of, economic, planning, since, 1923, and, favored, an, accelerated, pace, of, industrialization, in, 1921, he, had, also, been, a, prominent, supporter, of, gosplan, as, a, newly, established, body, and, called, for, the, strengthening, of, its, formal, responsibilities, to, support, a, balanced, level, of, economic, reconstruction, after, the, civil, war, trotsky, also, urged, economic, decentralisation, between, the, state, oblast, regions, and, factories, to, counter, structural, inefficiency, and, the, problem, of, bureaucracy, originally, he, had, proposed, the, principles, underlying, the, n, e, p, in, 1920, to, the, politburo, to, mitigate, urgent, economic, matters, arising, from, war, communism, he, would, later, reproach, lenin, privately, about, the, delayed, government, response, in, 1921, 1922, however, his, position, differed, from, the, majority, of, soviet, leaders, at, the, time, who, fully, supported, the, new, economic, policy, comparatively, trotsky, believed, that, planning, and, n, e, p, should, develop, within, a, mixed, framework, until, the, socialist, sector, gradually, superseded, the, private, industry, he, found, allies, among, a, circle, of, economic, theorists, and, administrators, which, included, yevgeni, preobrazhensky, and, georgy, pyatakov, deputy, chairman, of, the, council, of, the, national, economy, more, broadly, intellectuals, would, constitute, the, core, of, the, left, opposition, during, the, succession, period, trotsky, had, specified, the, need, for, the, overall, guidance, in, planning, i, e, the, systematic, co, ordination, of, the, fundamental, sectors, of, the, state, economy, in, the, process, of, adapting, to, the, present, market, and, urged, for, a, national, plan, alongside, currency, stabilization, he, also, rejected, the, stalinist, conception, of, industrialisation, which, favoured, heavy, industry, rather, he, proposed, the, use, of, foreign, trade, as, an, accelerator, and, to, direct, investments, by, means, of, a, system, of, comparative, coefficients, trotsky, and, the, left, opposition, developed, a, number, of, economic, proposals, in, response, to, the, scissor, crisis, which, had, undermined, relations, between, the, workers, and, peasants, in, 1923, 1924, this, included, a, progressive, tax, on, the, wealthier, sections, of, populations, such, as, the, kulaks, and, nepmen, alongside, an, equilibrium, of, the, import, export, balance, to, access, accumulated, reserves, to, purchase, machinery, from, abroad, to, increase, the, pace, of, industrialization, the, policy, was, later, adopted, by, members, of, the, united, opposition, which, also, advocated, a, programme, of, rapid, industrialization, during, the, debates, of, 1924, and, 1927, the, united, opposition, proposed, a, progressive, tax, on, wealthier, peasants, the, encouragement, of, agricultural, cooperatives, and, the, formation, of, collective, farms, on, a, voluntary, basis, trotsky, as, president, of, the, electrification, commission, along, with, members, of, the, opposition, bloc, had, put, forward, an, electrification, plan, which, involved, the, construction, of, the, hydroelectric, dnieprostroi, dam, he, had, also, warned, against, the, danger, of, market, spontaneity, and, called, for, a, well, thought, out, strategy, of, commercial, balance, overall, trotsky, was, sharply, critical, of, bukharin, and, stalin, s, views, on, the, state, of, the, soviet, economy, russian, historian, vladimir, buldakov, found, that, some, historical, research, had, supported, the, view, that, trotsky, advocated, the, most, rational, decisions, for, industrial, development, in, 1932, 33, trotsky, maintained, the, need, for, mass, participation, in, the, operationalisation, of, the, planned, economy, he, elaborated, on, the, need, of, soviet, democracy, for, the, industrialization, period, when, questioned, by, the, dewey, commission, in, 1937, the, successes, are, very, important, and, i, affirmed, it, every, time, they, are, due, to, the, abolition, of, private, property, and, to, the, possibilities, inherent, in, planned, economy, but, they, i, cannot, say, exactly, but, i, will, say, two, or, three, times, less, than, they, could, be, under, a, regime, of, soviet, democracy, according, to, fitzpatrick, the, scholarly, consensus, was, that, stalin, appropriated, the, position, of, the, left, opposition, on, such, matters, as, industrialisation, and, collectivisation, other, scholars, have, argued, that, the, economic, programme, of, trotsky, differed, from, the, forced, policy, of, collectivisation, implemented, by, stalin, after, 1928, due, to, the, levels, of, brutality, associated, with, its, enforcement, the, permanent, revolution, concept, is, the, theory, that, the, bourgeois, democratic, tasks, in, countries, with, delayed, bourgeois, democratic, development, can, only, be, accomplished, through, the, establishment, of, a, workers, state, and, that, the, creation, of, a, workers, state, would, inevitably, involve, inroads, against, capitalist, property, thus, the, accomplishment, of, bourgeois, democratic, tasks, passes, over, into, proletarian, tasks, although, most, closely, associated, with, leon, trotsky, the, call, for, a, permanent, revolution, is, first, found, in, the, writings, of, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, in, march, 1850, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 1848, revolution, in, their, address, of, the, central, committee, to, the, communist, league, it, is, our, interest, and, our, task, to, make, the, revolution, permanent, until, all, the, more, or, less, propertied, classes, have, been, driven, from, their, ruling, positions, until, the, proletariat, has, conquered, state, power, and, until, the, association, of, the, proletarians, has, progressed, sufficiently, far, not, only, in, one, country, but, in, all, the, leading, countries, of, the, world, that, competition, between, the, proletarians, of, these, countries, ceases, and, at, least, the, decisive, forces, of, production, are, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, the, workers, their, battle, cry, must, be, the, permanent, revolution, trotsky, s, conception, of, the, permanent, revolution, is, based, on, his, understanding, drawing, on, the, work, of, the, founder, of, russian, marxism, georgy, plekhanov, that, in, backward, countries, the, tasks, of, the, bourgeois, democratic, revolution, could, not, be, achieved, by, the, bourgeoisie, itself, trotsky, first, developed, this, conception, in, collaboration, with, alexander, parvus, in, late, 1904, 1905, the, relevant, articles, were, later, collected, in, trotsky, s, books, 1905, and, in, permanent, revolution, which, also, contains, his, essay, results, and, prospects, some, trotskyists, have, argued, that, the, state, of, the, third, world, shows, that, capitalism, offers, no, way, forward, for, underdeveloped, countries, thus, again, proving, the, central, tenet, of, the, theory, according, to, his, biographer, isaac, deutscher, trotsky, explicitly, supported, revolution, through, proletarian, internationalism, but, was, opposed, to, achieving, this, via, military, conquest, with, documented, references, made, to, his, personal, opposition, to, the, war, with, poland, in, 1920, proposed, armistice, with, the, entente, and, temperance, with, staging, anti, british, revolts, in, the, middle, east, trotsky, was, a, central, figure, in, the, comintern, during, its, first, four, congresses, during, this, time, he, helped, to, generalize, the, strategy, and, tactics, of, the, bolsheviks, to, newly, formed, communist, parties, across, europe, and, further, afield, from, 1921, onwards, the, united, front, a, method, of, uniting, revolutionaries, and, reformists, in, the, common, struggle, while, winning, some, of, the, workers, to, revolution, was, the, central, tactic, put, forward, by, the, comintern, after, the, defeat, of, the, german, revolution, trotsky, was, a, strong, critic, of, the, shifting, comintern, policy, position, under, stalin, which, directed, german, communists, to, treat, social, democrats, as, social, fascists, historian, bertrand, patenaude, believed, that, the, comintern, policy, following, the, great, break, facilitated, the, rise, of, hitler, s, party, marxist, theorist, and, economist, hillel, ticktin, argued, that, trotsky, s, political, strategy, and, approach, to, fascism, such, as, the, emphasis, on, an, organisational, bloc, between, the, german, communist, party, and, social, democratic, party, during, the, interwar, period, would, very, likely, have, prevented, hitler, from, ascending, to, political, power, trotsky, also, formulated, a, theory, of, fascism, based, on, a, dialectical, interpretation, of, events, to, analyze, the, manifestation, of, italian, fascism, and, the, early, emergence, of, nazi, germany, from, 1930, to, 1933, after, he, was, exiled, and, politically, marginalized, by, stalinism, trotsky, continued, to, argue, for, a, united, front, against, fascism, in, germany, and, spain, according, to, joseph, choonara, of, the, british, socialist, workers, party, in, international, socialism, his, articles, on, the, united, front, represent, an, essential, part, of, his, political, legacy, the, concept, of, uneven, and, combined, development, derived, from, the, political, theories, of, trotsky, this, concept, was, developed, in, combination, with, the, related, theory, of, permanent, revolution, to, explain, the, historical, context, of, russia, he, would, later, elaborate, on, this, theory, to, explain, the, specific, laws, of, uneven, development, in, 1930, and, the, conditions, for, a, possible, revolutionary, scenario, according, to, biographer, ian, thatcher, this, theory, would, be, later, generalised, to, the, entire, history, of, mankind, political, scientists, emanuele, saccarelli, and, latha, varadarajan, valued, his, theory, as, a, signal, contribution, to, the, discipline, of, international, relations, they, argued, his, theory, presented, a, specific, understanding, of, capitalist, development, as, uneven, insofar, as, it, systematically, featured, geographically, divergent, advanced, and, backward, regions, across, the, world, economy, faith, merely, promises, to, move, mountains, but, technology, which, takes, nothing, on, faith, is, actually, able, to, cut, down, mountains, and, move, them, up, to, now, this, was, done, for, industrial, purposes, mines, or, for, railways, tunnels, in, the, future, this, will, be, done, on, an, immeasurably, larger, scale, according, to, a, general, industrial, and, artistic, plan, man, will, occupy, himself, with, re, registering, mountains, and, rivers, and, will, earnestly, and, repeatedly, make, improvements, in, nature, trotsky, literature, and, revolution, 1924, in, literature, and, revolution, trotsky, examined, aesthetic, issues, in, relation, to, class, and, the, russian, revolution, soviet, scholar, robert, bird, considered, his, work, as, the, first, systematic, treatment, of, art, by, a, communist, leader, and, a, catalyst, for, later, marxist, cultural, and, critical, theories, trotsky, also, defended, intellectual, autonomy, in, regards, to, literary, movements, as, well, scientific, theories, such, as, freudian, psychoanalytic, theory, and, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, during, the, succession, period, however, these, theories, were, increasingly, marginalised, during, the, stalin, era, he, would, later, co, author, the, 1938, manifesto, for, an, independent, revolutionary, art, with, the, signed, endorsement, of, andre, breton, and, rivera, trotsky, s, writings, on, literature, such, as, his, 1923, survey, which, advocated, tolerance, limited, censorship, and, respect, for, literary, tradition, had, strong, appeal, to, the, new, york, intellectuals, trotsky, presented, a, critique, of, contemporary, literary, movements, such, as, futurism, and, emphasised, a, need, of, cultural, autonomy, for, the, development, of, a, socialist, culture, according, to, literary, critic, terry, eagleton, trotsky, recognised, like, lenin, on, the, need, for, a, socialist, culture, to, absorb, the, finest, products, of, bourgeois, art, trotsky, himself, viewed, the, proletarian, culture, as, temporary, and, transitional, which, would, provide, the, foundations, for, a, culture, above, classes, he, also, argued, that, the, pre, conditions, for, artistic, creativity, were, economic, well, being, and, emancipation, from, material, constraints, political, scientist, baruch, knei, paz, characterised, his, view, on, the, role, of, the, party, as, transmitters, of, culture, to, the, masses, and, raising, the, standards, of, education, as, well, as, entry, into, the, cultural, sphere, but, that, the, process, of, artistic, creation, in, terms, of, language, and, presentation, should, be, the, domain, of, the, practitioner, knei, paz, also, noted, key, distinctions, between, trotsky, s, approach, on, cultural, matters, and, stalin, s, policy, in, the, 1930s, our, relations, with, kamenev, which, were, very, good, in, the, first, period, after, the, insurrection, began, to, become, more, distant, from, that, day, the, need, of, the, hour, was, for, a, man, who, would, incarnate, the, call, to, struggle, a, man, who, subordinating, himself, completely, to, the, requirements, of, the, struggle, would, become, the, ringing, summons, to, arms, the, will, which, exacts, from, all, unconditional, submission, to, a, great, sacrificial, necessity, only, a, man, with, trotsky, s, capacity, for, work, only, a, man, so, unsparing, of, himself, as, trotsky, only, a, man, who, knew, how, to, speak, to, the, soldiers, as, trotsky, did, only, such, a, man, could, have, become, the, standard, bearer, of, the, armed, toilers, he, was, all, things, rolled, into, one
