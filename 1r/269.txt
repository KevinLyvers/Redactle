poets, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, dr, johnson, was, a, devout, anglican, and, a, committed, tory, though, tall, and, robust, he, displayed, gestures, and, tics, that, disconcerted, some, on, meeting, him, boswell, s, life, of, samuel, johnson, along, with, other, biographies, documented, johnson, s, behaviour, and, mannerisms, in, such, detail, that, they, have, informed, the, posthumous,

being, claimed, to, be, the, one, truly, great, critic, of, english, literature, a, prevailing, mode, of, literary, theory, in, the, 20th, century, drew, from, his, views, and, he, had, a, lasting, impact, on, biography, johnson, s, dictionary, had, far, reaching, effects, on, modern, english, and, was, pre, eminent, until, the, arrival, of, the, oxford, english, dictionary, 150, years, later, boswell, s, life, was, selected, by, johnson, biographer, walter, jackson, bate, as, the, most, famous, single, work, of, biographical, art, in, the, whole, of, literature, samuel, johnson, was, born, on, 18, september, 1709, to, sarah, johnson, n, e, ford, 1669, 1759, and, michael, johnson, 1656, 1732, a, bookseller, his, mother, was, 40, when, she, gave, birth, to, johnson, in, the, family, home, above, his, father, s, bookshop, in, lichfield, staffordshire, this, was, considered, an, unusually, late, pregnancy, so, precautions, were, taken, and, a, man, midwife, and, surgeon, of, great, reputation, named, george, hector, was, brought, in, to, assist, the, infant, johnson, did, not, cry, and, there, were, concerns, for, his, health, his, aunt, exclaimed, that, she, would, not, have, picked, such, a, poor, creature, up, in, the, street, the, family, feared, that, johnson, would, not, survive, and, summoned, the, vicar, of, st, mary, s, to, perform, a, baptism, two, godfathers, were, chosen, samuel, swynfen, a, physician, and, graduate, of, pembroke, college, oxford, and, richard, wakefield, a, lawyer, coroner, and, lichfield, town, clerk, johnson, s, health, improved, and, he, was, put, to, wet, nurse, with, joan, marklew, some, time, later, he, contracted, scrofula, known, at, the, time, as, the, king, s, evil, because, it, was, thought, royalty, could, cure, it, sir, john, floyer, former, physician, to, king, charles, ii, recommended, that, the, young, johnson, should, receive, the, royal, touch, and, he, did, so, from, queen, anne, on, 30, march, 1712, however, the, ritual, proved, ineffective, and, an, operation, was, performed, that, left, him, with, permanent, scars, across, his, face, and, body, queen, anne, gave, johnson, an, amulet, on, a, chain, he, would, wear, the, rest, of, his, life, when, johnson, was, three, his, brother, nathaniel, was, born, in, a, letter, he, wrote, to, his, mother, nathaniel, complained, that, johnson, would, scarcely, ever, use, me, with, common, civility, with, the, birth, of, johnson, s, brother, their, father, was, unable, to, pay, the, debts, he, had, accrued, over, the, years, and, the, family, was, no, longer, able, to, maintain, its, standard, of, living, when, he, was, a, child, in, petticoats, and, had, learnt, to, read, mrs, johnson, one, morning, put, the, common, prayer, book, into, his, hands, pointed, to, the, collect, for, the, day, and, said, sam, you, must, get, this, by, heart, she, went, up, stairs, leaving, him, to, study, it, but, by, the, time, she, had, reached, the, second, floor, she, heard, him, following, her, what, s, the, matter, said, she, i, can, say, it, he, replied, and, repeated, it, distinctly, though, he, could, not, have, read, it, more, than, twice, boswell, s, life, of, johnson, johnson, displayed, signs, of, great, intelligence, as, a, child, and, his, parents, to, his, later, disgust, would, show, off, his, newly, acquired, accomplishments, his, education, began, at, the, age, of, three, and, was, provided, by, his, mother, who, had, him, memorise, and, recite, passages, from, the, book, of, common, prayer, when, samuel, turned, four, he, was, sent, to, a, nearby, school, and, at, the, age, of, six, he, was, sent, to, a, retired, shoemaker, to, continue, his, education, a, year, later, johnson, went, to, lichfield, grammar, school, where, he, excelled, in, latin, for, his, most, personal, poems, johnson, used, latin, during, this, time, johnson, started, to, exhibit, the, tics, that, would, influence, how, people, viewed, him, in, his, later, years, and, which, formed, the, basis, for, a, posthumous, diagnosis, of, tourette, syndrome, he, excelled, at, his, studies, and, was, promoted, to, the, upper, school, at, the, age, of, nine, during, this, time, he, befriended, edmund, hector, nephew, of, his, man, midwife, george, hector, and, john, taylor, with, whom, he, remained, in, contact, for, the, rest, of, his, life, at, the, age, of, 16, johnson, stayed, with, his, cousins, the, fords, at, pedmore, worcestershire, there, he, became, a, close, friend, of, cornelius, ford, who, employed, his, knowledge, of, the, classics, to, tutor, johnson, while, he, was, not, attending, school, ford, was, a, successful, well, connected, academic, and, notorious, alcoholic, whose, excesses, contributed, to, his, death, six, years, later, after, spending, six, months, with, his, cousins, johnson, returned, to, lichfield, but, hunter, the, headmaster, angered, by, the, impertinence, of, this, long, absence, refused, to, allow, johnson, to, continue, at, the, school, unable, to, return, to, lichfield, grammar, school, johnson, enrolled, at, the, king, edward, vi, grammar, school, at, stourbridge, as, the, school, was, located, near, pedmore, johnson, was, able, to, spend, more, time, with, the, fords, and, he, began, to, write, poems, and, verse, translations, however, he, spent, only, six, months, at, stourbridge, before, returning, once, again, to, his, parents, home, in, lichfield, during, this, time, johnson, s, future, remained, uncertain, because, his, father, was, deeply, in, debt, to, earn, money, johnson, began, to, stitch, books, for, his, father, and, it, is, likely, that, johnson, spent, much, time, in, his, father, s, bookshop, reading, and, building, his, literary, knowledge, the, family, remained, in, poverty, until, his, mother, s, cousin, elizabeth, harriotts, died, in, february, 1728, and, left, enough, money, to, send, johnson, to, university, on, 31, october, 1728, a, few, weeks, after, he, turned, 19, johnson, entered, pembroke, college, oxford, the, inheritance, did, not, cover, all, of, his, expenses, at, pembroke, and, andrew, corbet, a, friend, and, fellow, student, at, the, college, offered, to, make, up, the, deficit, johnson, made, friends, at, pembroke, and, read, much, his, tutor, asked, him, to, produce, a, latin, translation, of, alexander, pope, s, messiah, as, a, christmas, exercise, johnson, completed, half, of, the, translation, in, one, afternoon, and, the, rest, the, following, morning, although, the, poem, brought, him, praise, it, did, not, bring, the, material, benefit, he, had, hoped, for, the, poem, later, appeared, in, miscellany, of, poems, 1731, edited, by, john, husbands, a, pembroke, tutor, and, is, the, earliest, surviving, publication, of, any, of, johnson, s, writings, johnson, spent, the, rest, of, his, time, studying, even, during, the, christmas, holiday, he, drafted, a, plan, of, study, called, adversaria, which, he, left, unfinished, and, used, his, time, to, learn, french, while, working, on, his, greek, johnson, s, tutor, jorden, left, pembroke, some, months, after, johnson, s, arrival, and, was, replaced, by, william, adams, johnson, enjoyed, adams, s, tutoring, but, by, december, was, already, a, quarter, behind, in, his, student, fees, and, was, forced, to, return, to, lichfield, without, a, degree, having, spent, 13, months, at, oxford, he, left, behind, many, books, that, he, had, borrowed, from, his, father, because, he, could, not, afford, to, transport, them, and, also, because, he, hoped, to, return, he, eventually, did, receive, a, degree, just, before, the, publication, of, his, dictionary, in, 1755, the, university, of, oxford, awarded, johnson, the, degree, of, master, of, arts, he, was, awarded, an, honorary, doctorate, in, 1765, by, trinity, college, dublin, and, in, 1775, by, the, university, of, oxford, in, 1776, he, returned, to, pembroke, with, boswell, and, toured, the, college, with, his, former, tutor, adams, who, by, then, was, the, master, of, the, college, during, that, visit, he, recalled, his, time, at, the, college, and, his, early, career, and, expressed, his, later, fondness, for, jorden, little, is, known, about, johnson, s, life, between, the, end, of, 1729, and, 1731, it, is, likely, that, he, lived, with, his, parents, he, experienced, bouts, of, mental, anguish, and, physical, pain, during, years, of, illness, his, tics, and, gesticulations, associated, with, tourette, syndrome, became, more, noticeable, and, were, often, commented, upon, by, 1731, johnson, s, father, was, deeply, in, debt, and, had, lost, much, of, his, standing, in, lichfield, johnson, hoped, to, get, an, usher, s, position, which, became, available, at, stourbridge, grammar, school, but, since, he, did, not, have, a, degree, his, application, was, passed, over, on, 6, september, 1731, at, about, this, time, johnson, s, father, became, ill, and, developed, an, inflammatory, fever, which, led, to, his, death, in, december, 1731, when, johnson, was, twenty, two, devastated, by, his, father, s, death, johnson, sought, to, atone, for, an, occasion, he, did, not, go, with, his, father, to, sell, books, johnson, stood, for, a, considerable, time, bareheaded, in, the, rain, in, the, spot, his, father, s, stall, used, to, be, after, the, publication, of, boswell, s, life, of, samuel, johnson, a, statue, was, erected, in, that, spot, johnson, eventually, found, employment, as, undermaster, at, a, school, in, market, bosworth, run, by, sir, wolstan, dixie, who, allowed, johnson, to, teach, without, a, degree, johnson, was, treated, as, a, servant, and, considered, teaching, boring, but, nonetheless, found, pleasure, in, it, after, an, argument, with, dixie, he, left, the, school, and, by, june, 1732, he, had, returned, home, johnson, continued, to, look, for, a, position, at, a, lichfield, school, after, being, turned, down, for, a, job, at, ashbourne, school, he, spent, time, with, his, friend, edmund, hector, who, was, living, in, the, home, of, the, publisher, thomas, warren, at, the, time, warren, was, starting, his, birmingham, journal, and, he, enlisted, johnson, s, help, this, connection, with, warren, grew, and, johnson, proposed, a, translation, of, jer, nimo, lobo, s, account, of, the, abyssinians, johnson, read, abb, joachim, le, grand, s, french, translations, and, thought, that, a, shorter, version, might, be, useful, and, profitable, instead, of, writing, the, work, himself, he, dictated, to, hector, who, then, took, the, copy, to, the, printer, and, made, any, corrections, johnson, s, a, voyage, to, abyssinia, was, published, a, year, later, he, returned, to, lichfield, in, february, 1734, and, began, an, annotated, edition, of, poliziano, s, latin, poems, along, with, a, history, of, latin, poetry, from, petrarch, to, poliziano, a, proposal, was, soon, printed, but, a, lack, of, funds, halted, the, project, johnson, remained, with, his, close, friend, harry, porter, during, a, terminal, illness, which, ended, in, porter, s, death, on, 3, september, 1734, porter, s, wife, elizabeth, n, e, jervis, otherwise, known, as, tetty, was, now, a, widow, at, the, age, of, 45, with, three, children, some, months, later, johnson, began, to, court, her, william, shaw, a, friend, and, biographer, of, johnson, claims, that, the, first, advances, probably, proceeded, from, her, as, her, attachment, to, johnson, was, in, opposition, to, the, advice, and, desire, of, all, her, relations, johnson, was, inexperienced, in, such, relationships, but, the, well, to, do, widow, encouraged, him, and, promised, to, provide, for, him, with, her, substantial, savings, they, married, on, 9, july, 1735, at, st, werburgh, s, church, in, derby, the, porter, family, did, not, approve, of, the, match, partly, because, of, the, difference, in, their, ages, johnson, was, 25, and, elizabeth, was, 46, elizabeth, s, marriage, to, johnson, so, disgusted, her, son, jervis, that, he, severed, all, relations, with, her, however, her, daughter, lucy, accepted, johnson, from, the, start, and, her, other, son, joseph, later, came, to, accept, the, marriage, in, june, 1735, while, working, as, a, tutor, for, the, children, of, thomas, whitby, a, local, staffordshire, gentleman, johnson, had, applied, for, the, position, of, headmaster, at, solihull, school, although, johnson, s, friend, gilbert, walmisley, gave, his, support, johnson, was, passed, over, because, the, school, s, directors, thought, he, was, a, very, haughty, ill, natured, gent, and, that, he, has, such, a, way, of, distorting, his, face, which, though, he, can, t, help, the, gents, think, it, may, affect, some, lads, with, walmisley, s, encouragement, johnson, decided, that, he, could, be, a, successful, teacher, if, he, ran, his, own, school, in, the, autumn, of, 1735, johnson, opened, edial, hall, school, as, a, private, academy, at, edial, near, lichfield, he, had, only, three, pupils, lawrence, offley, george, garrick, and, the, 18, year, old, david, garrick, who, later, became, one, of, the, most, famous, actors, of, his, day, the, venture, was, unsuccessful, and, cost, tetty, a, substantial, portion, of, her, fortune, instead, of, trying, to, keep, the, failing, school, going, johnson, began, to, write, his, first, major, work, the, historical, tragedy, irene, biographer, robert, demaria, believed, that, tourette, syndrome, likely, made, public, occupations, like, schoolmaster, or, tutor, almost, impossible, for, johnson, this, may, have, led, johnson, to, the, invisible, occupation, of, authorship, johnson, left, for, london, with, his, former, pupil, david, garrick, on, 2, march, 1737, the, day, johnson, s, brother, died, he, was, penniless, and, pessimistic, about, their, travel, but, fortunately, for, them, garrick, had, connections, in, london, and, the, two, were, able, to, stay, with, his, distant, relative, richard, norris, johnson, soon, moved, to, greenwich, near, the, golden, hart, tavern, to, finish, irene, on, 12, july, 1737, he, wrote, to, edward, cave, with, a, proposal, for, a, translation, of, paolo, sarpi, s, the, history, of, the, council, of, trent, 1619, which, cave, did, not, accept, until, months, later, in, october, 1737, johnson, brought, his, wife, to, london, and, he, found, employment, with, cave, as, a, writer, for, the, gentleman, s, magazine, his, assignments, for, the, magazine, and, other, publishers, during, this, time, were, almost, unparalleled, in, range, and, variety, and, so, numerous, so, varied, and, scattered, that, johnson, himself, could, not, make, a, complete, list, in, may, 1738, his, first, major, work, the, poem, london, was, published, anonymously, based, on, juvenal, s, satire, iii, it, describes, the, character, thales, leaving, for, wales, to, escape, the, problems, of, london, which, is, portrayed, as, a, place, of, crime, corruption, and, poverty, johnson, could, not, bring, himself, to, regard, the, poem, as, earning, him, any, merit, as, a, poet, alexander, pope, said, that, the, author, will, soon, be, d, terr, unearthed, dug, up, but, this, would, not, happen, until, 15, years, later, in, august, johnson, s, lack, of, an, ma, degree, from, oxford, or, cambridge, led, to, his, being, denied, a, position, as, master, of, the, appleby, grammar, school, in, an, effort, to, end, such, rejections, pope, asked, lord, gower, to, use, his, influence, to, have, a, degree, awarded, to, johnson, gower, petitioned, oxford, for, an, honorary, degree, to, be, awarded, to, johnson, but, was, told, that, it, was, too, much, to, be, asked, gower, then, asked, a, friend, of, jonathan, swift, to, plead, with, swift, to, use, his, influence, at, trinity, college, dublin, to, have, a, master, s, degree, awarded, to, johnson, in, the, hope, that, this, could, then, be, used, to, justify, an, ma, from, oxford, but, these, efforts, were, again, in, vain, and, unforthcoming, between, 1737, and, 1739, johnson, befriended, poet, richard, savage, feeling, guilty, of, living, almost, entirely, on, tetty, s, money, johnson, stopped, living, with, her, and, spent, his, time, with, savage, they, were, poor, and, would, stay, in, taverns, or, sleep, in, night, cellars, some, nights, they, would, roam, the, streets, until, dawn, because, they, had, no, money, during, this, period, johnson, and, savage, worked, as, grub, street, writers, who, anonymously, supplied, publishers, with, on, demand, material, in, his, dictionary, johnson, defined, grub, street, as, the, name, of, a, street, in, moorfields, in, london, much, inhabited, by, writers, of, small, histories, dictionaries, and, temporary, poems, whence, any, mean, production, is, called, grubstreet, savage, s, friends, tried, to, help, him, by, attempting, to, persuade, him, to, move, to, wales, but, savage, ended, up, in, bristol, and, again, fell, into, debt, he, was, committed, to, debtors, prison, and, died, in, 1743, a, year, later, johnson, wrote, life, of, mr, richard, savage, 1744, a, moving, work, which, in, the, words, of, the, biographer, and, critic, walter, jackson, bate, remains, one, of, the, innovative, works, in, the, history, of, biography, in, 1746, a, group, of, publishers, approached, johnson, with, the, idea, of, creating, an, authoritative, dictionary, of, the, english, language, a, contract, with, william, strahan, and, associates, worth, 1, 500, guineas, was, signed, on, the, morning, of, 18, june, 1746, johnson, claimed, that, he, could, finish, the, project, in, three, years, in, comparison, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, had, 40, scholars, spending, 40, years, to, complete, their, dictionary, which, prompted, johnson, to, claim, this, is, the, proportion, let, me, see, forty, times, forty, is, sixteen, hundred, as, three, to, sixteen, hundred, so, is, the, proportion, of, an, englishman, to, a, frenchman, although, he, did, not, succeed, in, completing, the, work, in, three, years, he, did, manage, to, finish, it, in, eight, some, criticised, the, dictionary, including, the, historian, thomas, babington, macaulay, who, described, johnson, as, a, wretched, etymologist, but, according, to, bate, the, dictionary, easily, ranks, as, one, of, the, greatest, single, achievements, of, scholarship, and, probably, the, greatest, ever, performed, by, one, individual, who, laboured, under, anything, like, the, disadvantages, in, a, comparable, length, of, time, johnson, s, constant, work, on, the, dictionary, disrupted, his, and, tetty, s, living, conditions, he, had, to, employ, a, number, of, assistants, for, the, copying, and, mechanical, work, which, filled, the, house, with, incessant, noise, and, clutter, he, was, always, busy, and, kept, hundreds, of, books, around, him, john, hawkins, described, the, scene, the, books, he, used, for, this, purpose, were, what, he, had, in, his, own, collection, a, copious, but, a, miserably, ragged, one, and, all, such, as, he, could, borrow, which, latter, if, ever, they, came, back, to, those, that, lent, them, were, so, defaced, as, to, be, scarce, worth, owning, johnson, s, process, included, underlining, words, in, the, numerous, books, he, wanted, to, include, in, his, dictionary, the, assistants, would, copy, out, the, underlined, sentences, on, individual, paper, slips, which, would, later, be, alphabetized, and, accompanied, with, examples, johnson, was, also, distracted, by, tetty, s, poor, health, as, she, began, to, show, signs, of, a, terminal, illness, to, accommodate, both, his, wife, and, his, work, he, moved, to, 17, gough, square, near, his, printer, william, strahan, in, preparation, johnson, had, written, a, plan, for, the, dictionary, philip, stanhope, 4th, earl, of, chesterfield, was, the, patron, of, the, plan, to, johnson, s, displeasure, seven, years, after, first, meeting, johnson, to, go, over, the, work, chesterfield, wrote, two, anonymous, essays, in, the, world, recommending, the, dictionary, he, complained, that, the, english, language, lacked, structure, and, argued, in, support, of, the, dictionary, johnson, did, not, like, the, tone, of, the, essays, and, he, felt, that, chesterfield, had, not, fulfilled, his, obligations, as, the, work, s, patron, in, a, letter, to, chesterfield, johnson, expressed, this, view, and, harshly, criticised, chesterfield, saying, is, not, a, patron, my, lord, one, who, looks, with, unconcern, on, a, man, struggling, for, life, in, the, water, and, when, he, has, reached, ground, encumbers, him, with, help, the, notice, which, you, have, been, pleased, to, take, of, my, labours, had, it, been, early, had, been, kind, but, it, has, been, delayed, till, i, am, indifferent, and, cannot, enjoy, it, till, i, am, solitary, and, cannot, impart, it, till, i, am, known, and, do, not, want, it, chesterfield, impressed, by, the, language, kept, the, letter, displayed, on, a, table, for, anyone, to, read, the, dictionary, was, finally, published, in, april, 1755, with, the, title, page, noting, that, the, university, of, oxford, had, awarded, johnson, a, master, of, arts, degree, in, anticipation, of, the, work, the, dictionary, as, published, was, a, large, book, its, pages, were, nearly, 18, inches, 46, cm, tall, and, the, book, was, 20, inches, 51, cm, wide, when, opened, it, contained, 42, 773, entries, to, which, only, a, few, more, were, added, in, subsequent, editions, and, it, sold, for, the, extravagant, price, of, 4, 10s, perhaps, the, rough, equivalent, of, 350, today, an, important, innovation, in, english, lexicography, was, to, illustrate, the, meanings, of, his, words, by, literary, quotation, of, which, there, were, approximately, 114, 000, the, authors, most, frequently, cited, include, william, shakespeare, john, milton, and, john, dryden, it, was, years, before, johnson, s, dictionary, as, it, came, to, be, known, turned, a, profit, authors, royalties, were, unknown, at, the, time, and, johnson, once, his, contract, to, deliver, the, book, was, fulfilled, received, no, further, money, from, its, sale, years, later, many, of, its, quotations, would, be, repeated, by, various, editions, of, the, webster, s, dictionary, and, the, new, english, dictionary, johnson, s, dictionary, was, not, the, first, nor, was, it, unique, other, dictionaries, such, as, nathan, bailey, s, dictionarium, britannicum, included, more, words, and, in, the, 150, years, preceding, johnson, s, dictionary, about, twenty, other, general, purpose, monolingual, english, dictionaries, had, been, produced, however, there, was, open, dissatisfaction, with, the, dictionaries, of, the, period, in, 1741, david, hume, claimed, the, elegance, and, propriety, of, stile, have, been, very, much, neglected, among, us, we, have, no, dictionary, of, our, language, and, scarce, a, tolerable, grammar, johnson, s, dictionary, offers, insights, into, the, 18th, century, and, a, faithful, record, of, the, language, people, used, it, is, more, than, a, reference, book, it, is, a, work, of, literature, it, was, the, most, commonly, used, and, imitated, for, the, 150, years, between, its, first, publication, and, the, completion, of, the, oxford, english, dictionary, in, 1928, johnson, also, wrote, numerous, essays, sermons, and, poems, during, his, years, working, on, the, dictionary, in, 1750, he, decided, to, produce, a, series, of, essays, under, the, title, the, rambler, that, were, to, be, published, every, tuesday, and, saturday, and, sell, for, twopence, each, during, this, time, johnson, published, no, fewer, than, 208, essays, each, around, 1, 200, 1, 500, words, long, explaining, the, title, years, later, he, told, his, friend, and, portraitist, joshua, reynolds, i, was, at, a, loss, how, to, name, it, i, sat, down, at, night, upon, my, bedside, and, resolved, that, i, would, not, go, to, sleep, till, i, had, fixed, its, title, the, rambler, seemed, the, best, that, occurred, and, i, took, it, these, essays, often, on, moral, and, religious, topics, tended, to, be, more, grave, than, the, title, of, the, series, would, suggest, his, first, comments, in, the, rambler, were, to, ask, that, in, this, undertaking, thy, holy, spirit, may, not, be, withheld, from, me, but, that, i, may, promote, thy, glory, and, the, salvation, of, myself, and, others, the, popularity, of, the, rambler, took, off, once, the, issues, were, collected, in, a, volume, they, were, reprinted, nine, times, during, johnson, s, life, writer, and, printer, samuel, richardson, enjoying, the, essays, greatly, questioned, the, publisher, as, to, who, wrote, the, works, only, he, and, a, few, of, johnson, s, friends, were, told, of, johnson, s, authorship, one, friend, the, novelist, charlotte, lennox, includes, a, defence, of, the, rambler, in, her, novel, the, female, quixote, 1752, in, particular, the, character, mr, glanville, says, you, may, sit, in, judgment, upon, the, productions, of, a, young, a, richardson, or, a, johnson, rail, with, premeditated, malice, at, the, rambler, and, for, the, want, of, faults, turn, even, its, inimitable, beauties, into, ridicule, book, vi, chapter, xi, later, the, novel, describes, johnson, as, the, greatest, genius, in, the, present, age, his, necessary, attendance, while, his, play, was, in, rehearsal, and, during, its, performance, brought, him, acquainted, with, many, of, the, performers, of, both, sexes, which, produced, a, more, favourable, opinion, of, their, profession, than, he, had, harshly, expressed, in, his, life, of, savage, with, some, of, them, he, kept, up, an, acquaintance, as, long, as, he, and, they, lived, and, was, ever, ready, to, shew, them, acts, of, kindness, he, for, a, considerable, time, used, to, frequent, the, green, room, and, seemed, to, take, delight, in, dissipating, his, gloom, by, mixing, in, the, sprightly, chit, chat, of, the, motley, circle, then, to, be, found, there, mr, david, hume, related, to, me, from, mr, garrick, that, johnson, at, last, denied, himself, this, amusement, from, considerations, of, rigid, virtue, saying, i, ll, come, no, more, behind, your, scenes, david, for, the, silk, stockings, and, white, bosoms, of, your, actresses, excite, my, amorous, propensities, boswell, s, life, of, samuel, johnson, not, all, of, his, work, was, confined, to, the, rambler, his, most, highly, regarded, poem, the, vanity, of, human, wishes, was, written, with, such, extraordinary, speed, that, boswell, claimed, johnson, might, have, been, perpetually, a, poet, the, poem, is, an, imitation, of, juvenal, s, satire, x, and, claims, that, the, antidote, to, vain, human, wishes, is, non, vain, spiritual, wishes, in, particular, johnson, emphasises, the, helpless, vulnerability, of, the, individual, before, the, social, context, and, the, inevitable, self, deception, by, which, human, beings, are, led, astray, the, poem, was, critically, celebrated, but, it, failed, to, become, popular, and, sold, fewer, copies, than, london, in, 1749, garrick, made, good, on, his, promise, that, he, would, produce, irene, but, its, title, was, altered, to, mahomet, and, irene, to, make, it, fit, for, the, stage, irene, which, was, written, in, blank, verse, was, received, rather, poorly, with, a, friend, of, boswell, s, commenting, the, play, to, be, as, frigid, as, the, regions, of, nova, zembla, now, and, then, you, felt, a, little, heat, like, what, is, produced, by, touching, ice, the, show, eventually, ran, for, nine, nights, tetty, johnson, was, ill, during, most, of, her, time, in, london, and, in, 1752, she, decided, to, return, to, the, countryside, while, johnson, was, busy, working, on, his, dictionary, she, died, on, 17, march, 1752, and, at, word, of, her, death, johnson, wrote, a, letter, to, his, old, friend, taylor, which, according, to, taylor, expressed, grief, in, the, strongest, manner, he, had, ever, read, johnson, wrote, a, sermon, in, her, honour, to, be, read, at, her, funeral, but, taylor, refused, to, read, it, for, reasons, which, are, unknown, this, only, exacerbated, johnson, s, feelings, of, loss, and, despair, consequently, john, hawkesworth, had, to, organise, the, funeral, johnson, felt, guilty, about, the, poverty, in, which, he, believed, he, had, forced, tetty, to, live, and, blamed, himself, for, neglecting, her, he, became, outwardly, discontented, and, his, diary, was, filled, with, prayers, and, laments, over, her, death, which, continued, until, his, own, she, was, his, primary, motivation, and, her, death, hindered, his, ability, to, complete, his, work, on, 16, march, 1756, johnson, was, arrested, for, an, outstanding, debt, of, 5, 18, s, unable, to, contact, anyone, else, he, wrote, to, the, writer, and, publisher, samuel, richardson, richardson, who, had, previously, lent, johnson, money, sent, him, six, guineas, to, show, his, good, will, and, the, two, became, friends, soon, after, johnson, met, and, befriended, the, painter, joshua, reynolds, who, so, impressed, johnson, that, he, declared, him, almost, the, only, man, whom, i, call, a, friend, reynolds, s, younger, sister, frances, observed, during, their, time, together, that, men, women, and, children, gathered, around, him, laughing, at, his, gestures, and, gesticulations, in, addition, to, reynolds, johnson, was, close, to, bennet, langton, and, arthur, murphy, langton, was, a, scholar, and, an, admirer, of, johnson, who, persuaded, his, way, into, a, meeting, with, johnson, which, led, to, a, long, friendship, johnson, met, murphy, during, the, summer, of, 1754, after, murphy, came, to, johnson, about, the, accidental, republishing, of, the, rambler, no, 190, and, the, two, became, friends, around, this, time, anna, williams, began, boarding, with, johnson, she, was, a, minor, poet, who, was, poor, and, becoming, blind, two, conditions, that, johnson, attempted, to, change, by, providing, room, for, her, and, paying, for, a, failed, cataract, surgery, williams, in, turn, became, johnson, s, housekeeper, to, occupy, himself, johnson, began, to, work, on, the, literary, magazine, or, universal, review, the, first, issue, of, which, was, printed, on, 19, march, 1756, philosophical, disagreements, erupted, over, the, purpose, of, the, publication, when, the, seven, years, war, began, and, johnson, started, to, write, polemical, essays, attacking, the, war, after, the, war, began, the, magazine, included, many, reviews, at, least, 34, of, which, were, written, by, johnson, when, not, working, on, the, magazine, johnson, wrote, a, series, of, prefaces, for, other, writers, such, as, giuseppe, baretti, william, payne, and, charlotte, lennox, johnson, s, relationship, with, lennox, and, her, works, was, particularly, close, during, these, years, and, she, in, turn, relied, so, heavily, upon, johnson, that, he, was, the, most, important, single, fact, in, mrs, lennox, s, literary, life, he, later, attempted, to, produce, a, new, edition, of, her, works, but, even, with, his, support, they, were, unable, to, find, enough, interest, to, follow, through, with, its, publication, to, help, with, domestic, duties, while, johnson, was, busy, with, his, various, projects, richard, bathurst, a, physician, and, a, member, of, johnson, s, club, pressured, him, to, take, on, a, freed, slave, francis, barber, as, his, servant, johnson, s, work, on, the, plays, of, william, shakespeare, took, up, most, of, his, time, on, 8, june, 1756, johnson, published, his, proposals, for, printing, by, subscription, the, dramatick, works, of, william, shakespeare, which, argued, that, previous, editions, of, shakespeare, were, edited, incorrectly, and, needed, to, be, corrected, johnson, s, progress, on, the, work, slowed, as, the, months, passed, and, he, told, music, historian, charles, burney, in, december, 1757, that, it, would, take, him, until, the, following, march, to, complete, it, before, that, could, happen, he, was, arrested, again, for, a, debt, of, 40, in, february, 1758, the, debt, was, soon, repaid, by, jacob, tonson, who, had, contracted, johnson, to, publish, shakespeare, and, this, encouraged, johnson, to, finish, his, edition, to, repay, the, favour, although, it, took, him, another, seven, years, to, finish, johnson, completed, a, few, volumes, of, his, shakespeare, to, prove, his, commitment, to, the, project, in, 1758, johnson, began, to, write, a, weekly, series, the, idler, which, ran, from, 15, april, 1758, to, 5, april, 1760, as, a, way, to, avoid, finishing, his, shakespeare, this, series, was, shorter, and, lacked, many, features, of, the, rambler, unlike, his, independent, publication, of, the, rambler, the, idler, was, published, in, a, weekly, news, journal, the, universal, chronicle, a, publication, supported, by, john, payne, john, newbery, robert, stevens, and, william, faden, since, the, idler, did, not, occupy, all, johnson, s, time, he, was, able, to, publish, his, philosophical, novella, rasselas, on, 19, april, 1759, the, little, story, book, as, johnson, described, it, describes, the, life, of, prince, rasselas, and, nekayah, his, sister, who, are, kept, in, a, place, called, the, happy, valley, in, the, land, of, abyssinia, the, valley, is, a, place, free, of, problems, where, any, desire, is, quickly, satisfied, the, constant, pleasure, does, not, however, lead, to, satisfaction, and, with, the, help, of, a, philosopher, named, imlac, rasselas, escapes, and, explores, the, world, to, witness, how, all, aspects, of, society, and, life, in, the, outside, world, are, filled, with, suffering, they, return, to, abyssinia, but, do, not, wish, to, return, to, the, state, of, constantly, fulfilled, pleasures, found, in, the, happy, valley, rasselas, was, written, in, one, week, to, pay, for, his, mother, s, funeral, and, settle, her, debts, it, became, so, popular, that, there, was, a, new, english, edition, of, the, work, almost, every, year, references, to, it, appear, in, many, later, works, of, fiction, including, jane, eyre, cranford, and, the, house, of, the, seven, gables, its, fame, was, not, limited, to, english, speaking, nations, rasselas, was, immediately, translated, into, five, languages, french, dutch, german, russian, and, italian, and, later, into, nine, others, by, 1762, however, johnson, had, gained, notoriety, for, his, dilatoriness, in, writing, the, contemporary, poet, churchill, teased, johnson, for, the, delay, in, producing, his, long, promised, edition, of, shakespeare, he, for, subscribers, baits, his, hook, and, takes, your, cash, but, where, s, the, book, the, comments, soon, motivated, johnson, to, finish, his, shakespeare, and, after, receiving, the, first, payment, from, a, government, pension, on, 20, july, 1762, he, was, able, to, dedicate, most, of, his, time, towards, this, goal, earlier, that, july, the, 24, year, old, king, george, iii, granted, johnson, an, annual, pension, of, 300, in, appreciation, for, the, dictionary, while, the, pension, did, not, make, johnson, wealthy, it, did, allow, him, a, modest, yet, comfortable, independence, for, the, remaining, 22, years, of, his, life, the, award, came, largely, through, the, efforts, of, sheridan, and, the, earl, of, bute, when, johnson, questioned, if, the, pension, would, force, him, to, promote, a, political, agenda, or, support, various, officials, he, was, told, by, bute, that, the, pension, is, not, given, you, for, anything, you, are, to, do, but, for, what, you, have, done, on, 16, may, 1763, johnson, first, met, 22, year, old, james, boswell, who, would, later, become, johnson, s, first, major, biographer, in, the, bookshop, of, johnson, s, friend, tom, davies, they, quickly, became, friends, although, boswell, would, return, to, his, home, in, scotland, or, travel, abroad, for, months, at, a, time, around, the, spring, of, 1763, johnson, formed, the, club, a, social, group, that, included, his, friends, reynolds, burke, garrick, goldsmith, and, others, the, membership, later, expanded, to, include, adam, smith, and, edward, gibbon, in, addition, to, boswell, himself, they, decided, to, meet, every, monday, at, 7, 00, pm, at, the, turk, s, head, in, gerrard, street, soho, and, these, meetings, continued, until, long, after, the, deaths, of, the, original, members, on, 9, january, 1765, murphy, introduced, johnson, to, henry, thrale, a, wealthy, brewer, and, mp, and, his, wife, hester, they, struck, up, an, instant, friendship, johnson, was, treated, as, a, member, of, the, family, and, was, once, more, motivated, to, continue, working, on, his, shakespeare, afterwards, johnson, stayed, with, the, thrales, for, 17, years, until, henry, s, death, in, 1781, sometimes, staying, in, rooms, at, thrale, s, anchor, brewery, in, southwark, hester, thrale, s, documentation, of, johnson, s, life, during, this, time, in, her, correspondence, and, her, diary, thraliana, became, an, important, source, of, biographical, information, on, johnson, after, his, death, during, the, whole, of, the, interview, johnson, talked, to, his, majesty, with, profound, respect, but, still, in, his, firm, manly, manner, with, a, sonorous, voice, and, never, in, that, subdued, tone, which, is, commonly, used, at, the, levee, and, in, the, drawing, room, after, the, king, withdrew, johnson, shewed, himself, highly, pleased, with, his, majesty, s, conversation, and, gracious, behaviour, he, said, to, mr, barnard, sir, they, may, talk, of, the, king, as, they, will, but, he, is, the, finest, gentleman, i, have, ever, seen, boswell, s, life, of, samuel, johnson, johnson, s, edition, of, shakespeare, was, finally, published, on, 10, october, 1765, as, the, plays, of, william, shakespeare, in, eight, volumes, to, which, are, added, notes, by, sam, johnson, in, a, printing, of, one, thousand, copies, the, first, edition, quickly, sold, out, and, a, second, was, soon, printed, the, plays, themselves, were, in, a, version, that, johnson, felt, was, closest, to, the, original, based, on, his, analysis, of, the, manuscript, editions, johnson, s, revolutionary, innovation, was, to, create, a, set, of, corresponding, notes, that, allowed, readers, to, clarify, the, meaning, behind, many, of, shakespeare, s, more, complicated, passages, and, to, examine, those, which, had, been, transcribed, incorrectly, in, previous, editions, included, within, the, notes, are, occasional, attacks, upon, rival, editors, of, shakespeare, s, works, years, later, edmond, malone, an, important, shakespearean, scholar, and, friend, of, johnson, s, stated, that, johnson, s, vigorous, and, comprehensive, understanding, threw, more, light, on, his, authour, than, all, his, predecessors, had, done, on, 6, august, 1773, eleven, years, after, first, meeting, boswell, johnson, set, out, to, visit, his, friend, in, scotland, and, to, begin, a, journey, to, the, western, islands, of, scotland, as, johnson, s, 1775, account, of, their, travels, would, put, it, that, account, was, intended, to, discuss, the, social, problems, and, struggles, that, affected, the, scottish, people, but, it, also, praised, many, of, the, unique, facets, of, scottish, society, such, as, a, school, in, edinburgh, for, the, deaf, and, mute, also, johnson, used, the, work, to, enter, into, the, dispute, over, the, authenticity, of, james, macpherson, s, ossian, poems, claiming, they, could, not, have, been, translations, of, ancient, scottish, literature, on, the, grounds, that, in, those, times, nothing, had, been, written, in, the, earse, language, there, were, heated, exchanges, between, the, two, and, according, to, one, of, johnson, s, letters, macpherson, threatened, physical, violence, boswell, s, account, of, their, journey, the, journal, of, a, tour, to, the, hebrides, 1786, was, a, preliminary, step, toward, his, later, biography, the, life, of, samuel, johnson, included, were, various, quotations, and, descriptions, of, events, including, anecdotes, such, as, johnson, swinging, a, broadsword, while, wearing, scottish, garb, or, dancing, a, highland, jig, in, the, 1770s, johnson, who, had, tended, to, be, an, opponent, of, the, government, early, in, life, published, a, series, of, pamphlets, in, favour, of, various, government, policies, in, 1770, he, produced, the, false, alarm, a, political, pamphlet, attacking, john, wilkes, in, 1771, his, thoughts, on, the, late, transactions, respecting, falkland, s, islands, cautioned, against, war, with, spain, in, 1774, he, printed, the, patriot, a, critique, of, what, he, viewed, as, false, patriotism, on, the, evening, of, 7, april, 1775, he, made, the, famous, statement, patriotism, is, the, last, refuge, of, a, scoundrel, this, line, was, not, as, widely, believed, about, patriotism, in, general, but, what, johnson, considered, to, be, the, false, use, of, the, term, patriotism, by, wilkes, and, his, supporters, johnson, opposed, self, professed, patriots, in, general, but, valued, what, he, considered, true, patriotism, the, last, of, these, pamphlets, taxation, no, tyranny, 1775, was, a, defence, of, the, coercive, acts, and, a, response, to, the, declaration, of, rights, of, the, first, continental, congress, which, protested, against, taxation, without, representation, johnson, argued, that, in, emigrating, to, america, colonists, had, voluntarily, resigned, the, power, of, voting, but, they, still, retained, virtual, representation, in, parliament, in, a, parody, of, the, declaration, of, rights, johnson, suggested, that, the, americans, had, no, more, right, to, govern, themselves, than, the, cornish, and, asked, how, is, it, that, we, hear, the, loudest, yelps, for, liberty, among, the, drivers, of, negroes, if, the, americans, wanted, to, participate, in, parliament, said, johnson, they, could, move, to, england, and, purchase, an, estate, johnson, denounced, english, supporters, of, american, separatists, as, traitors, to, this, country, and, hoped, that, the, matter, would, be, settled, without, bloodshed, but, he, felt, confident, that, it, would, end, with, english, superiority, and, american, obedience, years, before, johnson, had, stated, that, the, french, and, indian, war, was, a, conflict, between, two, robbers, of, native, american, lands, and, that, neither, deserved, to, live, there, after, the, signing, of, the, 1783, treaty, of, paris, marking, the, colonists, victory, over, the, british, johnson, became, deeply, disturbed, with, the, state, of, this, kingdom, mr, thrale, s, death, was, a, very, essential, loss, to, johnson, who, although, he, did, not, foresee, all, that, afterwards, happened, was, sufficiently, convinced, that, the, comforts, which, mr, thrale, s, family, afforded, him, would, now, in, great, measure, cease, boswell, s, life, of, samuel, johnson, on, 3, may, 1777, while, johnson, was, trying, and, failing, to, save, reverend, william, dodd, from, execution, for, forgery, he, wrote, to, boswell, that, he, was, busy, preparing, a, little, lives, and, little, prefaces, to, a, little, edition, of, the, english, poets, tom, davies, william, strahan, and, thomas, cadell, had, asked, johnson, to, create, this, final, major, work, the, lives, of, the, english, poets, for, which, he, asked, 200, guineas, an, amount, significantly, less, than, the, price, he, could, have, demanded, the, lives, which, were, critical, as, well, as, biographical, studies, appeared, as, prefaces, to, selections, of, each, poet, s, work, and, they, were, longer, and, more, detailed, than, originally, expected, the, work, was, finished, in, march, 1781, and, the, whole, collection, was, published, in, six, volumes, as, johnson, justified, in, the, advertisement, for, the, work, my, purpose, was, only, to, have, allotted, to, every, poet, an, advertisement, like, those, which, we, find, in, the, french, miscellanies, containing, a, few, dates, and, a, general, character, johnson, was, unable, to, enjoy, this, success, because, henry, thrale, the, dear, friend, with, whom, he, lived, died, on, 4, april, 1781, life, changed, quickly, for, johnson, when, hester, thrale, became, romantically, involved, with, the, italian, singing, teacher, gabriel, mario, piozzi, which, forced, johnson, to, change, his, previous, lifestyle, after, returning, home, and, then, travelling, for, a, short, period, johnson, received, word, that, his, friend, and, tenant, robert, levet, had, died, on, 17, january, 1782, johnson, was, shocked, by, the, death, of, levet, who, had, resided, at, johnson, s, london, home, since, 1762, shortly, afterwards, johnson, caught, a, cold, that, developed, into, bronchitis, and, lasted, for, several, months, his, health, was, further, complicated, by, feeling, forlorn, and, lonely, over, levet, s, death, and, by, the, deaths, of, his, friend, thomas, lawrence, and, his, housekeeper, williams, although, he, had, recovered, his, health, by, august, johnson, experienced, emotional, trauma, when, he, was, given, word, that, hester, thrale, would, sell, the, residence, that, johnson, shared, with, the, family, what, hurt, johnson, most, was, the, possibility, that, he, would, be, left, without, her, constant, company, months, later, on, 6, october, 1782, johnson, attended, church, for, the, final, time, in, his, life, to, say, goodbye, to, his, former, residence, and, life, the, walk, to, the, church, strained, him, but, he, managed, the, journey, unaccompanied, while, there, he, wrote, a, prayer, for, the, thrale, family, to, thy, fatherly, protection, o, lord, i, commend, this, family, bless, guide, and, defend, them, that, they, may, pass, through, this, world, as, finally, to, enjoy, in, thy, presence, everlasting, happiness, for, jesus, christ, s, sake, amen, hester, thrale, did, not, completely, abandon, johnson, and, asked, him, to, accompany, the, family, on, a, trip, to, brighton, he, agreed, and, was, with, them, from, 7, october, to, 20, november, 1782, on, his, return, his, health, began, to, fail, and, he, was, left, alone, after, boswell, s, visit, on, 29, may, 1783, on, 17, june, 1783, johnson, s, poor, circulation, resulted, in, a, stroke, and, he, wrote, to, his, neighbour, edmund, allen, that, he, had, lost, the, ability, to, speak, two, doctors, were, brought, in, to, aid, johnson, he, regained, his, ability, to, speak, two, days, later, johnson, feared, that, he, was, dying, and, wrote, the, black, dog, i, hope, always, to, resist, and, in, time, to, drive, though, i, am, deprived, of, almost, all, those, that, used, to, help, me, the, neighbourhood, is, impoverished, i, had, once, richardson, and, lawrence, in, my, reach, mrs, allen, is, dead, my, house, has, lost, levet, a, man, who, took, interest, in, everything, and, therefore, ready, at, conversation, mrs, williams, is, so, weak, that, she, can, be, a, companion, no, longer, when, i, rise, my, breakfast, is, solitary, the, black, dog, waits, to, share, it, from, breakfast, to, dinner, he, continues, barking, except, that, dr, brocklesby, for, a, little, keeps, him, at, a, distance, dinner, with, a, sick, woman, you, may, venture, to, suppose, not, much, better, than, solitary, after, dinner, what, remains, but, to, count, the, clock, and, hope, for, that, sleep, which, i, can, scarce, expect, night, comes, at, last, and, some, hours, of, restlessness, and, confusion, bring, me, again, to, a, day, of, solitude, what, shall, exclude, the, black, dog, from, an, habitation, like, this, by, this, time, he, was, sick, and, gout, ridden, he, had, surgery, for, gout, and, his, remaining, friends, including, novelist, fanny, burney, the, daughter, of, charles, burney, came, to, keep, him, company, he, was, confined, to, his, room, from, 14, december, 1783, to, 21, april, 1784, a, few, days, before, his, death, he, had, asked, sir, john, hawkins, one, of, his, executors, where, he, should, be, buried, and, on, being, answered, doubtless, in, westminster, abbey, seemed, to, feel, a, satisfaction, very, natural, to, a, poet, boswell, s, life, of, samuel, johnson, his, health, began, to, improve, by, may, 1784, and, he, travelled, to, oxford, with, boswell, on, 5, may, 1784, by, july, many, of, johnson, s, friends, were, either, dead, or, gone, boswell, had, left, for, scotland, and, hester, thrale, had, become, engaged, to, piozzi, with, no, one, to, visit, johnson, expressed, a, desire, to, die, in, london, and, arrived, there, on, 16, november, 1784, on, 25, november, 1784, he, allowed, burney, to, visit, him, and, expressed, an, interest, to, her, that, he, should, leave, london, he, soon, left, for, islington, to, george, strahan, s, home, his, final, moments, were, filled, with, mental, anguish, and, delusions, when, his, physician, thomas, warren, visited, and, asked, him, if, he, were, feeling, better, johnson, burst, out, with, no, sir, you, cannot, conceive, with, what, acceleration, i, advance, towards, death, many, visitors, came, to, see, johnson, as, he, lay, sick, in, bed, but, he, preferred, only, langton, s, company, burney, waited, for, word, of, johnson, s, condition, along, with, windham, strahan, hoole, cruikshank, des, moulins, and, barber, on, 13, december, 1784, johnson, met, with, two, others, a, young, woman, miss, morris, whom, johnson, blessed, and, francesco, sastres, an, italian, teacher, who, was, given, some, of, johnson, s, final, words, iam, moriturus, i, who, am, about, to, die, shortly, afterwards, he, fell, into, a, coma, and, died, at, 7, 00, p, m, langton, waited, until, 11, 00, p, m, to, tell, the, others, which, led, to, john, hawkins, becoming, pale, and, overcome, with, an, agony, of, mind, along, with, seward, and, hoole, describing, johnson, s, death, as, the, most, awful, sight, boswell, remarked, my, feeling, was, just, one, large, expanse, of, stupor, i, could, not, believe, it, my, imagination, was, not, convinced, william, gerard, hamilton, joined, in, and, stated, he, has, made, a, chasm, which, not, only, nothing, can, fill, up, but, which, nothing, has, a, tendency, to, fill, up, johnson, is, dead, let, us, go, to, the, next, best, there, is, nobody, no, man, can, be, said, to, put, you, in, mind, of, johnson, he, was, buried, on, 20, december, 1784, at, westminster, abbey, with, an, inscription, that, reads, johnson, s, works, especially, his, lives, of, the, poets, series, describe, various, features, of, excellent, writing, he, believed, that, the, best, poetry, relied, on, contemporary, language, and, he, disliked, the, use, of, decorative, or, purposely, archaic, language, he, was, suspicious, of, the, poetic, language, used, by, milton, whose, blank, verse, he, believed, would, inspire, many, bad, imitations, also, johnson, opposed, the, poetic, language, of, his, contemporary, thomas, gray, his, greatest, complaint, was, that, obscure, allusions, found, in, works, like, milton, s, lycidas, were, overused, he, preferred, poetry, that, could, be, easily, read, and, understood, in, addition, to, his, views, on, language, johnson, believed, that, a, good, poem, incorporated, new, and, unique, imagery, in, his, smaller, poetic, works, johnson, relied, on, short, lines, and, filled, his, work, with, a, feeling, of, empathy, which, possibly, influenced, housman, s, poetic, style, in, london, his, first, imitation, of, juvenal, johnson, uses, the, poetic, form, to, express, his, political, opinion, and, approaches, the, topic, in, a, playful, and, almost, joyous, manner, however, his, second, imitation, the, vanity, of, human, wishes, is, completely, different, the, language, remains, simple, but, the, poem, is, more, complicated, and, difficult, to, read, because, johnson, is, trying, to, describe, complex, christian, ethics, these, christian, values, are, not, unique, to, the, poem, but, contain, views, expressed, in, most, of, johnson, s, works, in, particular, johnson, emphasises, god, s, infinite, love, and, argues, that, happiness, can, be, attained, through, virtuous, action, when, it, came, to, biography, johnson, disagreed, with, plutarch, s, use, of, biography, to, praise, and, to, teach, morality, instead, johnson, believed, in, portraying, the, biographical, subjects, accurately, and, including, any, negative, aspects, of, their, lives, because, his, insistence, on, accuracy, in, biography, was, little, short, of, revolutionary, johnson, had, to, struggle, against, a, society, that, was, unwilling, to, accept, biographical, details, that, could, be, viewed, as, tarnishing, a, reputation, this, became, the, subject, of, rambler, 60, furthermore, johnson, believed, that, biography, should, not, be, limited, to, the, most, famous, and, that, the, lives, of, lesser, individuals, too, were, significant, thus, in, his, lives, of, the, poets, he, chose, both, great, and, lesser, poets, in, all, his, biographies, he, insisted, on, including, what, others, would, have, considered, trivial, details, to, fully, describe, the, lives, of, his, subjects, johnson, considered, the, genre, of, autobiography, and, diaries, including, his, own, as, one, having, the, most, significance, in, idler, 84, he, writes, that, a, writer, of, an, autobiography, would, be, the, least, likely, to, distort, his, own, life, johnson, s, thoughts, on, biography, and, on, poetry, coalesced, in, his, understanding, of, what, would, make, a, good, critic, his, works, were, dominated, with, his, intent, to, use, them, for, literary, criticism, this, was, especially, true, of, his, dictionary, of, which, he, wrote, i, lately, published, a, dictionary, like, those, compiled, by, the, academies, of, italy, and, france, for, the, use, of, such, as, aspire, to, exactness, of, criticism, or, elegance, of, style, although, a, smaller, edition, became, the, household, standard, johnson, s, original, dictionary, was, an, academic, tool, that, examined, how, words, were, used, especially, in, literary, works, to, achieve, this, purpose, johnson, included, quotations, from, bacon, hooker, milton, shakespeare, spenser, and, many, others, from, what, he, considered, to, be, the, most, important, literary, fields, natural, science, philosophy, poetry, and, theology, these, quotations, and, usages, were, all, compared, and, carefully, studied, in, the, dictionary, so, that, a, reader, could, understand, what, words, in, literary, works, meant, in, context, johnson, did, not, attempt, to, create, schools, of, theories, to, analyse, the, aesthetics, of, literature, instead, he, used, his, criticism, for, the, practical, purpose, of, helping, others, to, better, read, and, understand, literature, when, it, came, to, shakespeare, s, plays, johnson, emphasised, the, role, of, the, reader, in, understanding, language, if, shakespeare, has, difficulties, above, other, writers, it, is, to, be, imputed, to, the, nature, of, his, work, which, required, the, use, of, common, colloquial, language, and, consequently, admitted, many, phrases, allusive, elliptical, and, proverbial, such, as, we, speak, and, hear, every, hour, without, observing, them, his, works, on, shakespeare, were, devoted, not, merely, to, shakespeare, but, to, understanding, literature, as, a, whole, in, his, preface, to, shakespeare, johnson, rejects, the, previous, dogma, of, the, classical, unities, and, argues, that, drama, should, be, faithful, to, life, however, johnson, did, not, only, defend, shakespeare, he, discussed, shakespeare, s, faults, including, what, he, saw, as, lack, of, morality, vulgarity, carelessness, in, crafting, plots, and, occasional, inattentiveness, when, choosing, words, or, word, order, as, well, as, direct, literary, criticism, johnson, emphasised, the, need, to, establish, a, text, that, accurately, reflects, what, an, author, wrote, shakespeare, s, plays, in, particular, had, multiple, editions, each, of, which, contained, errors, caused, by, the, printing, process, this, problem, was, compounded, by, careless, editors, who, deemed, difficult, words, incorrect, and, changed, them, in, later, editions, johnson, believed, that, an, editor, should, not, alter, the, text, in, such, a, way, johnson, s, tall, and, robust, figure, combined, with, his, odd, gestures, were, confusing, to, some, when, william, hogarth, first, saw, johnson, standing, near, a, window, in, richardson, s, house, shaking, his, head, and, rolling, himself, about, in, a, strange, ridiculous, manner, hogarth, thought, johnson, an, ideot, whom, his, relations, had, put, under, the, care, of, mr, richardson, hogarth, was, quite, surprised, when, this, figure, stalked, forwards, to, where, he, and, mr, richardson, were, sitting, and, all, at, once, took, up, the, argument, such, a, power, of, eloquence, that, hogarth, looked, at, him, with, astonishment, and, actually, imagined, that, this, ideot, had, been, at, the, moment, inspired, beyond, appearance, adam, smith, claimed, that, johnson, knew, more, books, than, any, man, alive, while, edmund, burke, thought, that, if, johnson, were, to, join, parliament, he, certainly, would, have, been, the, greatest, speaker, that, ever, was, there, johnson, relied, on, a, unique, form, of, rhetoric, and, he, is, well, known, for, his, refutation, of, bishop, berkeley, s, immaterialism, his, claim, that, matter, did, not, actually, exist, but, only, seemed, to, exist, during, a, conversation, with, boswell, johnson, powerfully, stomped, a, nearby, stone, and, proclaimed, of, berkeley, s, theory, i, refute, it, thus, after, we, came, out, of, the, church, we, stood, talking, for, some, time, together, of, bishop, berkeley, s, ingenious, sophistry, to, prove, the, non, existence, of, matter, and, that, every, thing, in, the, universe, is, merely, ideal, i, observed, that, though, we, are, satisfied, his, doctrine, is, not, true, it, is, impossible, to, refute, it, i, never, shall, forget, the, alacrity, with, which, johnson, answered, striking, his, foot, with, mighty, force, against, a, large, stone, till, he, rebounded, from, it, i, refute, it, thus, boswell, s, life, of, samuel, johnson, johnson, was, a, devout, conservative, anglican, and, a, compassionate, man, who, supported, a, number, of, poor, friends, under, his, own, roof, even, when, unable, to, fully, provide, for, himself, johnson, s, christian, morality, permeated, his, works, and, he, would, write, on, moral, topics, with, such, authority, and, in, such, a, trusting, manner, that, walter, jackson, bate, claims, no, other, moralist, in, history, excels, or, even, begins, to, rival, him, however, as, donald, greene, points, out, johnson, s, moral, writings, do, not, contain, a, predetermined, and, authorized, pattern, of, good, behavior, even, though, johnson, does, emphasise, certain, kinds, of, conduct, he, did, not, let, his, own, faith, prejudice, him, against, others, and, had, respect, for, those, of, other, denominations, who, demonstrated, a, commitment, to, christian, beliefs, although, johnson, respected, milton, s, poetry, he, could, not, tolerate, milton, s, puritan, and, republican, beliefs, feeling, that, they, were, contrary, to, england, and, christianity, he, was, an, opponent, of, slavery, on, moral, grounds, and, once, proposed, a, toast, to, the, next, rebellion, of, the, negroes, in, the, west, indies, beside, his, beliefs, concerning, humanity, johnson, is, also, known, for, his, love, of, cats, especially, his, own, two, cats, hodge, and, lily, boswell, wrote, i, never, shall, forget, the, indulgence, with, which, he, treated, hodge, his, cat, johnson, was, also, known, as, a, staunch, tory, he, admitted, to, sympathies, for, the, jacobite, cause, during, his, younger, years, but, by, the, reign, of, george, iii, he, came, to, accept, the, hanoverian, succession, it, was, boswell, who, gave, people, the, impression, that, johnson, was, an, arch, conservative, and, it, was, boswell, more, than, anyone, else, who, determined, how, johnson, would, be, seen, by, people, years, later, however, boswell, was, not, around, for, two, of, johnson, s, most, politically, active, periods, during, walpole, s, control, over, british, parliament, and, during, the, seven, years, war, although, boswell, was, present, with, johnson, during, the, 1770s, and, describes, four, major, pamphlets, written, by, johnson, he, neglects, to, discuss, them, because, he, is, more, interested, in, their, travels, to, scotland, this, is, compounded, by, the, fact, that, boswell, held, an, opinion, contrary, to, two, of, these, pamphlets, the, false, alarm, and, taxation, no, tyranny, and, so, attacks, johnson, s, views, in, his, biography, in, his, life, of, samuel, johnson, boswell, referred, to, johnson, as, dr, johnson, so, often, that, he, would, always, be, known, as, this, even, though, he, hated, being, so, called, boswell, s, emphasis, on, johnson, s, later, years, shows, him, too, often, as, merely, an, old, man, discoursing, in, a, tavern, to, a, circle, of, admirers, although, boswell, a, scotsman, was, his, close, companion, and, friend, johnson, like, many, of, his, fellow, englishmen, had, a, reputation, for, despising, scotland, and, its, people, even, during, their, journey, together, through, scotland, johnson, exhibited, prejudice, and, a, narrow, nationalism, hester, thrale, in, summarising, johnson, s, nationalistic, views, and, his, anti, scottish, prejudice, said, we, all, know, how, well, he, loved, to, abuse, the, scotch, indeed, to, be, abused, by, them, in, return, johnson, had, several, health, problems, including, childhood, tuberculous, scrofula, resulting, in, deep, facial, scarring, deafness, in, one, ear, and, blindness, in, one, eye, gout, testicular, cancer, and, a, stroke, in, his, final, year, that, left, him, unable, to, speak, his, autopsy, indicated, that, he, had, pulmonary, fibrosis, along, with, cardiac, failure, probably, due, to, hypertension, a, condition, then, unknown, johnson, displayed, signs, consistent, with, several, diagnoses, including, depression, and, tourette, syndrome, there, are, many, accounts, of, johnson, suffering, from, bouts, of, depression, and, what, johnson, thought, might, be, madness, as, walter, jackson, bate, puts, it, one, of, the, ironies, of, literary, history, is, that, its, most, compelling, and, authoritative, symbol, of, common, sense, of, the, strong, imaginative, grasp, of, concrete, reality, should, have, begun, his, adult, life, at, the, age, of, twenty, in, a, state, of, such, intense, anxiety, and, bewildered, despair, that, at, least, from, his, own, point, of, view, it, seemed, the, onset, of, actual, insanity, to, overcome, these, feelings, johnson, tried, to, constantly, involve, himself, with, various, activities, but, this, did, not, seem, to, help, taylor, said, that, johnson, at, one, time, strongly, entertained, thoughts, of, suicide, boswell, claimed, that, johnson, felt, himself, overwhelmed, with, an, horrible, melancholia, with, perpetual, irritation, fretfulness, and, impatience, and, with, a, dejection, gloom, and, despair, which, made, existence, misery, early, on, when, johnson, was, unable, to, pay, off, his, debts, he, began, to, work, with, professional, writers, and, identified, his, own, situation, with, theirs, during, this, time, johnson, witnessed, christopher, smart, s, decline, into, penury, and, the, madhouse, and, feared, that, he, might, share, the, same, fate, hester, thrale, piozzi, claimed, in, a, discussion, on, smart, s, mental, state, that, johnson, was, her, friend, who, feared, an, apple, should, intoxicate, him, to, her, what, separated, johnson, from, others, who, were, placed, in, asylums, for, madness, like, christopher, smart, was, his, ability, to, keep, his, concerns, and, emotions, to, himself, two, hundred, years, after, johnson, s, death, the, posthumous, diagnosis, of, tourette, syndrome, became, widely, accepted, the, condition, was, unknown, during, johnson, s, lifetime, but, boswell, describes, johnson, displaying, signs, of, tourette, syndrome, including, tics, and, other, involuntary, movements, according, to, boswell, he, commonly, held, his, head, to, one, side, moving, his, body, backwards, and, forwards, and, rubbing, his, left, knee, in, the, same, direction, with, the, palm, of, his, hand, e, made, various, sounds, like, a, half, whistle, or, as, if, clucking, like, a, hen, and, all, this, accompanied, sometimes, with, a, thoughtful, look, but, more, frequently, with, a, smile, generally, when, he, had, concluded, a, period, in, the, course, of, a, dispute, by, which, time, he, was, a, good, deal, exhausted, by, violence, and, vociferation, he, used, to, blow, out, his, breath, like, a, whale, there, are, many, similar, accounts, in, particular, johnson, was, said, to, perform, his, gesticulations, at, the, threshold, of, a, house, or, in, doorways, when, asked, by, a, little, girl, why, he, made, such, noises, and, acted, in, that, way, johnson, responded, from, bad, habit, the, diagnosis, of, the, syndrome, was, first, made, in, a, 1967, report, and, tourette, syndrome, researcher, arthur, k, shapiro, described, johnson, as, the, most, notable, example, of, a, successful, adaptation, to, life, despite, the, liability, of, tourette, syndrome, details, provided, by, the, writings, of, boswell, hester, thrale, and, others, reinforce, the, diagnosis, with, one, paper, concluding, also, displayed, many, of, the, obsessional, compulsive, traits, and, rituals, which, are, associated, with, this, syndrome, it, may, be, thought, that, without, this, illness, dr, johnson, s, remarkable, literary, achievements, the, great, dictionary, his, philosophical, deliberations, and, his, conversations, may, never, have, happened, and, boswell, the, author, of, the, greatest, of, biographies, would, have, been, unknown, johnson, was, in, the, words, of, steven, lynn, more, than, a, well, known, writer, and, scholar, he, was, a, celebrity, for, the, activities, and, the, state, of, his, health, in, his, later, years, were, constantly, reported, in, various, journals, and, newspapers, and, when, there, was, nothing, to, report, something, was, invented, according, to, bate, johnson, loved, biography, and, he, changed, the, whole, course, of, biography, for, the, modern, world, one, by, product, was, the, most, famous, single, work, of, biographical, art, in, the, whole, of, literature, boswell, s, life, of, johnson, and, there, were, many, other, memoirs, and, biographies, of, a, similar, kind, written, on, johnson, after, his, death, these, accounts, of, his, life, include, thomas, tyers, s, a, biographical, sketch, of, dr, samuel, johnson, 1784, boswell, s, the, journal, of, a, tour, to, the, hebrides, 1785, hester, thrale, s, anecdotes, of, the, late, samuel, johnson, which, drew, on, entries, from, her, diary, and, other, notes, john, hawkins, s, life, of, samuel, johnson, the, first, full, length, biography, of, johnson, and, in, 1792, arthur, murphy, s, an, essay, on, the, life, and, genius, of, samuel, johnson, which, replaced, hawkins, s, biography, as, the, introduction, to, a, collection, of, johnson, s, works, another, important, source, was, fanny, burney, who, described, johnson, as, the, acknowledged, head, of, literature, in, this, kingdom, and, kept, a, diary, containing, details, missing, from, other, biographies, above, all, boswell, s, portrayal, of, johnson, is, the, work, best, known, to, general, readers, although, critics, like, donald, greene, argue, about, its, status, as, a, true, biography, the, work, became, successful, as, boswell, and, his, friends, promoted, it, at, the, expense, of, the, many, other, works, on, johnson, s, life, in, criticism, johnson, had, a, lasting, influence, although, not, everyone, viewed, him, favourably, some, like, macaulay, regarded, johnson, as, an, idiot, savant, who, produced, some, respectable, works, and, others, like, the, romantic, poets, were, completely, opposed, to, johnson, s, views, on, poetry, and, literature, especially, with, regard, to, milton, however, some, of, their, contemporaries, disagreed, stendhal, s, racine, et, shakespeare, is, based, in, part, on, johnson, s, views, of, shakespeare, and, johnson, influenced, jane, austen, s, writing, style, and, philosophy, later, johnson, s, works, came, into, favour, and, matthew, arnold, in, his, six, chief, lives, from, johnson, s, lives, of, the, poets, considered, the, lives, of, milton, dryden, pope, addison, swift, and, gray, as, points, which, stand, as, so, many, natural, centres, and, by, returning, to, which, we, can, always, find, our, way, again, more, than, a, century, after, his, death, literary, critics, such, as, g, birkbeck, hill, and, t, s, eliot, came, to, regard, johnson, as, a, serious, critic, they, began, to, study, johnson, s, works, with, an, increasing, focus, on, the, critical, analysis, found, in, his, edition, of, shakespeare, and, lives, of, the, poets, yvor, winters, claimed, that, a, great, critic, is, the, rarest, of, all, literary, geniuses, perhaps, the, only, critic, in, english, who, deserves, that, epithet, is, samuel, johnson, f, r, leavis, agreed, and, on, johnson, s, criticism, said, when, we, read, him, we, know, beyond, question, that, we, have, here, a, powerful, and, distinguished, mind, operating, at, first, hand, upon, literature, this, we, can, say, with, emphatic, conviction, really, is, criticism, edmund, wilson, claimed, that, the, lives, of, the, poets, and, the, prefaces, and, commentary, on, shakespeare, are, among, the, most, brilliant, and, the, most, acute, documents, in, the, whole, range, of, english, criticism, the, critic, harold, bloom, placed, johnson, s, work, firmly, within, the, western, canon, describing, him, as, unmatched, by, any, critic, in, any, nation, before, or, after, him, bate, in, the, finest, insight, on, johnson, i, know, emphasised, that, no, other, writer, is, so, obsessed, by, the, realisation, that, the, mind, is, an, activity, one, that, will, turn, to, destructiveness, of, the, self, or, of, others, unless, it, is, directed, to, labour, johnson, s, philosophical, insistence, that, the, language, within, literature, must, be, examined, became, a, prevailing, mode, of, literary, theory, during, the, mid, 20th, century, half, of, johnson, s, surviving, correspondence, together, with, some, of, his, manuscripts, editions, of, his, books, paintings, and, other, items, associated, with, him, are, in, the, donald, and, mary, hyde, collection, of, dr, samuel, johnson, housed, at, houghton, library, at, harvard, university, since, 2003, the, collection, includes, drafts, of, his, plan, for, a, dictionary, documents, associated, with, hester, thrale, piozzi, and, james, boswell, including, corrected, proofs, of, his, life, of, johnson, and, a, teapot, owned, by, johnson, there, are, many, societies, formed, around, and, dedicated, to, the, study, and, enjoyment, of, samuel, johnson, s, life, and, works, on, the, bicentennial, of, johnson, s, death, in, 1984, oxford, university, held, a, week, long, conference, featuring, 50, papers, and, the, arts, council, of, great,
