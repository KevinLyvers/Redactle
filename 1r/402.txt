and, circus, stories, but, she, often, blurred, the, boundaries, in, her, books, and, encompassed, a, range, of, genres, even, in, her, short, stories, in, a, 1958, article, published, in, the, author, she, wrote, that, there, were, a, dozen, or, more, different, types, of, stories, for, children, and, she, had, tried, them, all, but, her, favourites, were, those, with, a, family, at, their, centre, in, a, letter, to, the, psychologist, peter, mckellar, blyton, describes, her, writing, technique, i, shut, my, eyes, for, a, few, minutes, with, my, portable, typewriter, on, my, knee, i, make, my, mind, a, blank, and, wait, and, then, as, clearly, as, i, would, see, real, children, my, characters, stand, before, me, in, my, mind, s, eye, the, first, sentence, comes, straight, into, my, mind, i, don, t, have, to, think, of, it, i, don, t, have, to, think, of, anything, in, another, letter, to, mckellar, she, describes, how, in, just, five, days, she, wrote, the, 60, 000, word, book, the, river, of, adventure, the, eighth, in, her, adventure, series, by, listening, to, what, she, referred, to, as, her, under, mind, which, she, contrasted, with, her, upper, conscious, mind, blyton, was, unwilling, to, conduct, any, research, or, planning, before, beginning, work, on, a, new, book, which, coupled, with, the, lack, of, variety, in, her, life, according, to, druce, almost, inevitably, presented, the, danger, that, she, might, unconsciously, and, clearly, did, plagiarise, the, books, she, had, read, including, her, own, gillian, has, recalled, that, her, mother, never, knew, where, her, stories, came, from, but, that, she, used, to, talk, about, them, coming, from, her, mind, s, eye, as, did, william, wordsworth, and, charles, dickens, blyton, had, thought, it, was, made, up, of, every, experience, she, d, ever, had, everything, she, s, seen, or, heard, or, read, much, of, which, had, long, disappeared, from, her, conscious, memory, but, never, knew, the, direction, her, stories, would, take, blyton, further, explained, in, her, biography, that, if, i, tried, to, think, out, or, invent, the, whole, book, i, could, not, do, it, for, one, thing, it, would, bore, me, and, for, another, it, would, lack, the, verve, and, the, extraordinary, touches, and, surprising, ideas, that, flood, out, from, my, imagination, blyton, s, daily, routine, varied, little, over, the, years, she, usually, began, writing, soon, after, breakfast, with, her, portable, typewriter, on, her, knee, and, her, favourite, red, moroccan, shawl, nearby, she, believed, that, the, colour, red, acted, as, a, mental, stimulus, for, her, stopping, only, for, a, short, lunch, break, she, continued, writing, until, five, o, clock, by, which, time, she, would, usually, have, produced, 6, 000, 10, 000, words, a, 2000, article, in, the, malay, mail, considers, blyton, s, children, to, have, lived, in, a, world, shaped, by, the, realities, of, post, war, austerity, enjoying, freedom, without, political, correctness, which, serves, modern, readers, of, blyton, s, novels, with, a, form, of, escapism, brandon, robshaw, of, the, independent, refers, to, the, blyton, universe, as, crammed, with, colour, and, character, self, contained, and, internally, consistent, noting, that, blyton, exemplifies, a, strong, mistrust, of, adults, and, figures, of, authority, in, her, works, creating, a, world, in, which, children, govern, gillian, noted, that, in, her, mother, s, adventure, detective, and, school, stories, for, older, children, the, hook, is, the, strong, storyline, with, plenty, of, cliffhangers, a, trick, she, acquired, from, her, years, of, writing, serialised, stories, for, children, s, magazines, there, is, always, a, strong, moral, framework, in, which, bravery, and, loyalty, are, eventually, rewarded, blyton, herself, wrote, that, my, love, of, children, is, the, whole, foundation, of, all, my, work, victor, watson, assistant, director, of, research, at, homerton, college, cambridge, believes, that, blyton, s, works, reveal, an, essential, longing, and, potential, associated, with, childhood, and, notes, how, the, opening, pages, of, the, mountain, of, adventure, present, a, deeply, appealing, ideal, of, childhood, he, argues, that, blyton, s, work, differs, from, that, of, many, other, authors, in, its, approach, describing, the, narrative, of, the, famous, five, series, for, instance, as, like, a, powerful, spotlight, it, seeks, to, illuminate, to, explain, to, demystify, it, takes, its, readers, on, a, roller, coaster, story, in, which, the, darkness, is, always, banished, everything, puzzling, arbitrary, evocative, is, either, dismissed, or, explained, watson, further, notes, how, blyton, often, used, minimalist, visual, descriptions, and, introduced, a, few, careless, phrases, such, as, gleamed, enchantingly, to, appeal, to, her, young, readers, from, the, mid, 1950s, rumours, began, to, circulate, that, blyton, had, not, written, all, the, books, attributed, to, her, a, charge, she, found, particularly, distressing, she, published, an, appeal, in, her, magazine, asking, children, to, let, her, know, if, they, heard, such, stories, and, after, one, mother, informed, her, that, she, had, attended, a, parents, meeting, at, her, daughter, s, school, during, which, a, young, librarian, had, repeated, the, allegation, blyton, decided, in, 1955, to, begin, legal, proceedings, the, librarian, was, eventually, forced, to, make, a, public, apology, in, open, court, early, the, following, year, but, the, rumours, that, blyton, operated, a, company, of, ghost, writers, persisted, as, some, found, it, difficult, to, believe, that, one, woman, working, alone, could, produce, such, a, volume, of, work, blyton, felt, a, responsibility, to, provide, her, readers, with, a, positive, moral, framework, and, she, encouraged, them, to, support, worthy, causes, her, view, expressed, in, a, 1957, article, was, that, children, should, help, animals, and, other, children, rather, than, adults, are, not, interested, in, helping, adults, indeed, they, think, that, adults, themselves, should, tackle, adult, needs, but, they, are, intensely, interested, in, animals, and, other, children, and, feel, compassion, for, the, blind, boys, and, girls, and, for, the, spastics, who, are, unable, to, walk, or, talk, blyton, and, the, members, of, the, children, s, clubs, she, promoted, via, her, magazines, raised, a, great, deal, of, money, for, various, charities, according, to, blyton, membership, of, her, clubs, meant, working, for, others, for, no, reward, the, largest, of, the, clubs, she, was, involved, with, was, the, busy, bees, the, junior, section, of, the, people, s,

the, enid, blyton, magazine, it, attracted, 100, 000, members, in, three, years, such, was, blyton, s, popularity, among, children, that, after, she, became, queen, bee, in, 1952, more, than, 20, 000,

ability, to, churn, out, mediocre, material, noting, that, her, capacity, to, do, so, amounts, to, genius, anyone, else, would, have, died, of, boredom, long, ago, michael, rosen, children, s, laureate, from, 2007, until, 2009, wrote, that, i, find, myself, flinching, at, occasional, bursts, of, snobbery, and, the, assumed, level, of, privilege, of, the, children, and, families, in, the, books, the, children, s, author, anne, fine, presented, an, overview, of, the, concerns, about, blyton, s, work, and, responses, to, them, on, bbc, radio, 4, in, november, 2008, in, which, she, noted, the, drip, drip, drip, of, disapproval, associated, with, the, books, blyton, s, response, to, her, critics, was, that, she, was, uninterested, in, the, views, of, anyone, over, the, age, of, 12, stating, that, half, the, attacks, on, her, work, were, motivated, by, jealousy, and, the, rest, came, from, stupid, people, who, don, t, know, what, they, re, talking, about, because, they, ve, never, read, any, of, my, books, despite, criticism, by, contemporaries, that, her, work, s, quality, began, to, suffer, in, the, 1950s, at, the, expense, of, its, increasing, volume, blyton, nevertheless, capitalised, on, being, generally, regarded, at, the, time, as, a, more, savoury, english, alternative, to, what, some, considered, an, invasion, of, britain, by, american, culture, in, the, form, of, rock, music, horror, comics, television, teenage, culture, delinquency, and, disney, according, to, nicholas, tucker, the, works, of, enid, blyton, have, been, banned, from, more, public, libraries, over, the, years, than, is, the, case, with, any, other, adult, or, children, s, author, though, such, attempts, to, quell, the, popularity, of, her, books, over, the, years, seem, to, have, been, largely, unsuccessful, and, she, still, remains, very, widely, read, some, librarians, felt, that, blyton, s, restricted, use, of, language, a, conscious, product, of, her, teaching, background, was, prejudicial, to, an, appreciation, of, more, literary, qualities, in, a, scathing, article, published, in, encounter, in, 1958, the, journalist, colin, welch, remarked, that, it, was, hard, to, see, how, a, diet, of, miss, blyton, could, help, with, the, 11, plus, or, even, with, the, cambridge, english, tripos, but, reserved, his, harshest, criticism, for, blyton, s, noddy, describing, him, as, an, unnaturally, priggish, sanctimonious, witless, spiritless, snivelling, sneaking, doll, the, author, and, educational, psychologist, nicholas, tucker, notes, that, it, was, common, to, see, blyton, cited, as, people, s, favourite, or, least, favourite, author, according, to, their, age, and, argues, that, her, books, create, an, encapsulated, world, for, young, readers, that, simply, dissolves, with, age, leaving, behind, only, memories, of, excitement, and, strong, identification, fred, inglis, considers, blyton, s, books, to, be, technically, easy, to, read, but, to, also, be, emotionally, and, cognitively, easy, he, mentions, that, the, psychologist, michael, woods, believed, that, blyton, was, different, from, many, other, older, authors, writing, for, children, in, that, she, seemed, untroubled, by, presenting, them, with, a, world, that, differed, from, reality, woods, surmised, that, blyton, was, a, child, she, thought, as, a, child, and, wrote, as, a, child, the, basic, feeling, is, essentially, pre, adolescent, enid, blyton, has, no, moral, dilemmas, inevitably, enid, blyton, was, labelled, by, rumour, a, child, hater, if, true, such, a, fact, should, come, as, no, surprise, to, us, for, as, a, child, herself, all, other, children, can, be, nothing, but, rivals, for, her, inglis, argues, though, that, blyton, was, clearly, devoted, to, children, and, put, an, enormous, amount, of, energy, into, her, work, with, a, powerful, belief, in, representing, the, crude, moral, diagrams, and, garish, fantasies, of, a, readership, blyton, s, daughter, imogen, has, stated, that, she, loved, a, relationship, with, children, through, her, books, but, real, children, were, an, intrusion, and, there, was, no, room, for, intruders, in, the, world, that, blyton, occupied, through, her, writing, accusations, of, racism, in, blyton, s, books, were, first, made, by, lena, jeger, in, a, guardian, article, published, in, 1966, in, the, context, of, discussing, possible, moves, to, restrict, publications, inciting, racial, hatred, jeger, was, critical, of, blyton, s, the, little, black, doll, originally, published, in, 1937, sambo, the, black, doll, of, the, title, is, hated, by, his, owner, and, other, toys, owing, to, his, ugly, black, face, and, runs, away, a, shower, of, magic, rain, washes, his, face, clean, after, which, he, is, welcomed, back, home, with, his, now, pink, face, jamaica, kincaid, also, considers, the, noddy, books, to, be, deeply, racist, because, of, the, blonde, children, and, the, black, golliwogs, in, blyton, s, 1944, novel, the, island, of, adventure, a, black, servant, named, jo, jo, is, very, intelligent, but, is, particularly, cruel, to, the, children, accusations, of, xenophobia, were, also, made, as, george, greenfield, observed, enid, was, very, much, part, of, that, between, the, wars, middle, class, which, believed, that, foreigners, were, untrustworthy, or, funny, or, sometimes, both, the, publisher, macmillan, conducted, an, internal, assessment, of, blyton, s, the, mystery, that, never, was, submitted, to, them, at, the, height, of, her, fame, in, 1960, the, review, was, carried, out, by, the, author, and, books, editor, phyllis, hartnoll, in, whose, view, there, is, a, faint, but, unattractive, touch, of, old, fashioned, xenophobia, in, the, author, s, attitude, to, the, thieves, they, are, foreign, and, this, seems, to, be, regarded, as, sufficient, to, explain, their, criminality, macmillan, rejected, the, manuscript, but, it, was, published, by, william, collins, in, 1961, and, then, again, in, 1965, and, 1983, blyton, s, depictions, of, boys, and, girls, are, considered, by, many, critics, to, be, sexist, in, a, guardian, article, published, in, 2005, lucy, mangan, proposed, that, the, famous, five, series, depicts, a, power, struggle, between, julian, dick, and, george, georgina, in, which, the, female, characters, either, act, like, boys, or, are, talked, down, to, as, when, dick, lectures, george, it, s, really, time, you, gave, up, thinking, you, re, as, good, as, a, boy, to, address, criticisms, levelled, at, blyton, s, work, some, later, editions, have, been, altered, to, reflect, more, politically, progressive, attitudes, towards, issues, such, as, race, gender, violence, between, young, persons, the, treatment, of, children, by, adults, and, legal, changes, in, britain, as, to, what, is, allowable, for, young, children, to, do, e, g, purchasing, fireworks, in, the, years, since, the, stories, were, originally, written, modern, reprints, of, the, noddy, series, substitute, teddy, bears, or, goblins, for, golliwogs, for, instance, the, golliwogs, who, steal, noddy, s, car, and, dump, him, naked, in, the, dark, wood, in, here, comes, noddy, again, are, replaced, in, the, 1986, revision, by, goblins, who, strip, noddy, only, of, his, shoes, and, hat, and, return, at, the, end, of, the, story, to, apologise, the, faraway, tree, s, dame, slap, who, made, regular, use, of, corporal, punishment, was, changed, to, dame, snap, who, no, longer, did, so, and, the, names, of, dick, and, fanny, in, the, same, series, respective, slang, terms, in, some, dialects, for, male, and, female, genitals, were, changed, to, rick, and, frannie, characters, in, the, malory, towers, and, st, clare, s, series, are, no, longer, spanked, or, threatened, with, a, spanking, but, are, instead, scolded, references, to, george, s, short, hair, making, her, look, like, a, boy, were, removed, in, revisions, to, five, on, a, hike, together, reflecting, the, idea, that, girls, need, not, have, long, hair, to, be, considered, feminine, or, normal, as, was, anne, s, remark, in, the, famous, five, that, boys, cannot, wear, pretty, dresses, or, like, girls, dolls, in, the, adventurous, four, the, names, of, the, young, twin, girls, were, updated, from, jill, and, mary, to, pippa, and, zoe, among, changes, prompting, the, enid, blyton, society, s, organiser, to, argue, that, they, were, akin, to, having, a, virgin, express, rushing, past, the, railway, children, because, the, age, of, steam, is, over, e, don, t, want, to, ruin, the, charm, of, something, that, was, written, in, a, particular, setting, in, 2010, hodder, the, publisher, of, the, famous, five, series, announced, its, intention, to, update, the, language, used, in, the, books, of, which, it, sold, more, than, half, a, million, copies, a, year, the, changes, which, hodder, described, as, subtle, mainly, affect, the, dialogue, rather, than, the, narrative, for, instance, school, tunic, becomes, uniform, mother, and, father, and, mother, and, daddy, this, latter, one, used, by, young, female, characters, and, deemed, sexist, become, mum, and, dad, and, bathing, is, replaced, by, swimming, and, jersey, and, pullover, by, jumper, some, commentators, see, the, changes, as, necessary, to, encourage, modern, readers, whereas,
