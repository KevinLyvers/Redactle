johann, carl, friedrich, gauss, german, gau, latin, carolus, fridericus, gauss, 30, april, 1777, 23, february, 1855, was, a, german, mathematician, astronomer, geodesist, and, physicist, who, contributed, to, many, fields, in, mathematics, and, science, he, was, director, of, the, g, ttingen, observatory, and, professor, of, astronomy, from, 1807, until, his, death, in, 1855, while, studying, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, he, propounded, several, mathematical, theorems, gauss, completed, his, masterpieces, disquisitiones, arithmeticae, and, theoria, motus, corporum, coelestium, as, a, private, scholar, he, gave, the, second, and, third, complete, proofs, of, the, fundamental, theorem, of, algebra, made, contributions, to, number, theory, and, developed, the, theories, of, binary, and, ternary, quadratic, forms, gauss, was, instrumental, in, the, identification, of, ceres, as, a, dwarf, planet, his, work, on, the, motion, of, planetoids, disturbed, by, large, planets, led, to, the, introduction, of, the, gaussian, gravitational, constant, and, the, method, of, least, squares, which, he, had, discovered, before, adrien, marie, legendre, published, it, gauss, was, in, charge, of, the, extensive, geodetic, survey, of, the, kingdom, of, hanover, together, with, an, arc, measurement, project, from, 1820, to, 1844, he, was, one, of, the, founders, of, geophysics, and, formulated, the, fundamental, principles, of, magnetism, fruits, of, his, practical, work, were, the, inventions, of, the, heliotrope, in, 1821, a, magnetometer, in, 1833, and, alongside, wilhelm, eduard, weber, the, first, electromagnetic, telegraph, in, 1833, gauss, refused, to, publish, incomplete, work, and, left, several, works, to, be, edited, posthumously, he, believed, that, the, act, of, learning, not, possession, of, knowledge, provided, the, greatest, enjoyment, gauss, confessed, to, disliking, teaching, but, some, of, his, students, became, influential, mathematicians, such, as, richard, dedekind, and, bernhard, riemann, gauss, was, born, on, 30, april, 1777, in, brunswick, in, the, duchy, of, brunswick, wolfenb, ttel, now, in, the, german, state, of, lower, saxony, his, family, was, of, relatively, low, social, status, his, father, gebhard, dietrich, gauss, 1744, 1808, worked, variously, as, a, butcher, bricklayer, gardener, and, treasurer, of, a, death, benefit, fund, gauss, characterized, his, father, as, honourable, and, respected, but, rough, and, dominating, at, home, he, was, experienced, in, writing, and, calculating, whereas, his, second, wife, dorothea, carl, friedrich, s, mother, was, nearly, illiterate, he, had, one, elder, brother, from, his, father, s, first, marriage, gauss, was, a, child, prodigy, in, mathematics, when, the, elementary, teachers, noticed, his, intellectual, abilities, they, brought, him, to, the, attention, of, the, duke, of, brunswick, who, sent, him, to, the, local, collegium, carolinum, which, he, attended, from, 1792, to, 1795, with, eberhard, august, wilhelm, von, zimmermann, as, one, of, his, teachers, thereafter, the, duke, granted, him, the, resources, for, studies, of, mathematics, sciences, and, classical, languages, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, until, 1798, his, professor, in, mathematics, was, abraham, gotthelf, k, stner, whom, gauss, called, the, leading, mathematician, among, poets, and, the, leading, poet, among, mathematicians, because, of, his, epigrams, astronomy, was, taught, by, karl, felix, seyffer, with, whom, gauss, stayed, in, correspondence, after, graduation, olbers, and, gauss, mocked, him, in, their, correspondence, on, the, other, hand, he, thought, highly, of, georg, christoph, lichtenberg, his, teacher, of, physics, and, of, christian, gottlob, heyne, whose, lectures, in, classics, gauss, attended, with, pleasure, fellow, students, of, this, time, were, johann, friedrich, benzenberg, farkas, bolyai, and, heinrich, wilhelm, brandes, he, was, likely, a, self, taught, student, in, mathematics, since, he, independently, rediscovered, several, theorems, he, solved, a, geometrical, problem, that, had, occupied, mathematicians, since, the, ancient, greeks, when, he, determined, in, 1796, which, regular, polygons, can, be, constructed, by, compass, and, straightedge, this, discovery, ultimately, led, gauss, to, choose, mathematics, instead, of, philology, as, a, career, gauss, s, mathematical, diary, a, collection, of, short, remarks, about, his, results, from, the, years, 1796, until, 1814, shows, that, many, ideas, for, his, mathematical, magnum, opus, disquisitiones, arithmeticae, 1801, date, from, this, time, gauss, graduated, as, a, doctor, of, philosophy, in, 1799, not, in, g, ttingen, as, is, sometimes, stated, but, at, the, duke, of, brunswick, s, special, request, from, the, university, of, helmstedt, the, only, state, university, of, the, duchy, johann, friedrich, pfaff, assessed, his, doctoral, thesis, and, gauss, got, the, degree, in, absentia, without, further, oral, examination, the, duke, then, granted, him, the, cost, of, living, as, a, private, scholar, in, brunswick, gauss, subsequently, refused, calls, from, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, in, st, peterburg, and, landshut, university, later, the, duke, promised, him, the, foundation, of, an, observatory, in, brunswick, in, 1804, architect, peter, joseph, krahe, made, preliminary, designs, but, one, of, napoleon, s, wars, cancelled, those, plans, the, duke, was, killed, in, the, battle, of, jena, in, 1806, the, duchy, was, abolished, in, the, following, year, and, gauss, s, financial, support, stopped, when, gauss, was, calculating, asteroid, orbits, in, the, first, years, of, the, century, he, established, contact, with, the, astronomical, community, of, bremen, and, lilienthal, especially, wilhelm, olbers, karl, ludwig, harding, and, friedrich, wilhelm, bessel, as, part, of, the, informal, group, of, astronomers, known, as, the, celestial, police, one, of, their, aims, was, the, discovery, of, further, planets, they, assembled, data, on, asteroids, and, comets, as, a, basis, for, gauss, s, research, on, their, orbits, which, he, later, published, in, his, astronomical, magnum, opus, theoria, motus, corporum, coelestium, 1809, in, november, 1807, gauss, followed, a, call, to, the, university, of, g, ttingen, then, an, institution, of, the, newly, founded, kingdom, of, westphalia, under, j, r, me, bonaparte, as, full, professor, and, director, of, the, astronomical, observatory, and, kept, the, chair, until, his, death, in, 1855, he, was, soon, confronted, with, the, demand, for, two, thousand, francs, from, the, westphalian, government, as, a, war, contribution, which, he, could, not, afford, to, pay, both, olbers, and, laplace, wanted, to, help, him, with, the, payment, but, gauss, refused, their, assistance, finally, an, anonymous, person, from, frankfurt, later, discovered, to, be, prince, primate, dalberg, paid, the, sum, gauss, took, on, the, directorate, of, the, 60, year, old, observatory, founded, in, 1748, by, prince, elector, george, ii, and, built, on, a, converted, fortification, tower, with, usable, but, partly, out, of, date, instruments, the, construction, of, a, new, observatory, had, been, approved, by, prince, elector, george, iii, in, principle, since, 1802, and, the, westphalian, government, continued, the, planning, but, gauss, could, not, move, to, his, new, place, of, work, until, september, 1816, he, got, new, up, to, date, instruments, including, two, meridian, circles, from, repsold, and, reichenbach, and, a, heliometer, from, fraunhofer, the, scientific, activity, of, gauss, besides, pure, mathematics, can, be, roughly, divided, into, three, periods, astronomy, was, the, main, focus, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 19th, century, geodesy, in, the, third, decade, and, physics, mainly, magnetism, in, the, fourth, decade, gauss, made, no, secret, of, his, aversion, to, giving, academic, lectures, but, from, the, start, of, his, academic, career, at, g, ttingen, he, continuously, gave, lectures, until, 1854, he, often, complained, about, the, burdens, of, teaching, feeling, that, it, was, a, waste, of, his, time, on, the, other, hand, he, occasionally, described, some, students, as, talented, most, of, his, lectures, dealt, with, astronomy, geodesy, and, applied, mathematics, and, only, three, lectures, on, subjects, of, pure, mathematics, some, of, gauss, s, students, went, on, to, become, renowned, mathematicians, physicists, and, astronomers, moritz, cantor, dedekind, dirksen, encke, gould, heine, klinkerfues, kupffer, listing, m, bius, nicolai, riemann, ritter, schering, scherk, schumacher, von, staudt, stern, ursin, as, geoscientists, sartorius, von, waltershausen, and, wapp, us, gauss, did, not, write, any, textbook, and, disliked, the, popularization, of, scientific, matters, his, only, attempts, at, popularization, were, his, works, on, the, date, of, easter, 1800, 1802, and, the, essay, erdmagnetismus, und, magnetometer, of, 1836, gauss, published, his, papers, and, books, exclusively, in, latin, or, german, he, wrote, latin, in, a, classical, style, but, used, some, customary, modifications, set, by, contemporary, mathematicians, in, his, inaugural, lecture, at, g, ttingen, university, from, 1808, gauss, claimed, reliable, observations, and, results, attained, only, by, a, strong, calculus, as, the, sole, tasks, of, astronomy, at, university, he, was, accompanied, by, a, staff, of, other, lecturers, in, his, disciplines, who, completed, the, educational, program, these, included, the, mathematician, thibaut, with, his, lectures, the, physicist, mayer, known, for, his, textbooks, his, successor, weber, since, 1831, and, in, the, observatory, harding, who, took, the, main, part, of, lectures, in, practical, astronomy, when, the, observatory, was, completed, gauss, took, his, living, accommodation, in, the, western, wing, of, the, new, observatory, and, harding, in, the, eastern, one, they, had, once, been, on, friendly, terms, but, over, time, they, became, alienated, possibly, as, some, biographers, presume, because, gauss, had, wished, the, equal, ranked, harding, to, be, no, more, than, his, assistant, or, observer, gauss, used, the, new, meridian, circles, nearly, exclusively, and, kept, them, away, from, harding, except, for, some, very, seldom, joint, observations, brendel, subdivides, gauss, s, astronomic, activity, chronologically, into, seven, periods, of, which, the, years, since, 1820, are, taken, as, a, period, of, lower, astronomical, activity, the, new, well, equipped, observatory, did, not, work, as, effectively, as, other, ones, gauss, s, astronomical, research, had, the, character, of, a, one, man, enterprise, without, a, long, time, observation, program, and, the, university, established, a, place, for, an, assistant, only, after, harding, died, in, 1834, nevertheless, gauss, twice, refused, the, opportunity, to, solve, the, problem, by, accepting, offers, from, berlin, in, 1810, and, 1825, to, become, a, full, member, of, the, prussian, academy, without, burdening, lecturing, duties, as, well, as, from, leipzig, university, in, 1810, and, from, vienna, university, in, 1842, perhaps, because, of, the, family, s, difficult, situation, gauss, s, salary, was, raised, from, 1000, reichsthaler, in, 1810, to, 2400, reichsthaler, in, 1824, and, in, his, later, years, he, was, one, of, the, best, paid, professors, of, the, university, when, gauss, was, asked, for, help, by, his, colleague, and, friend, friedrich, wilhelm, bessel, in, 1810, who, was, in, trouble, at, k, nigsberg, university, because, of, his, lack, of, an, academic, title, gauss, provided, a, doctorate, honoris, causa, for, bessel, from, the, philosophy, faculty, of, g, ttingen, in, march, 1811, gauss, gave, another, recommendation, for, an, honorary, degree, for, sophie, germain, but, only, shortly, before, her, death, so, she, never, received, it, he, also, gave, successful, support, to, the, mathematician, gotthold, eisenstein, in, berlin, gauss, was, loyal, to, the, house, of, hanover, after, king, william, iv, died, in, 1837, the, new, hanoverian, king, ernest, augustus, annulled, the, 1833, constitution, seven, professors, later, known, as, the, g, ttingen, seven, protested, against, this, among, them, his, friend, and, collaborator, wilhelm, weber, and, gauss, s, son, in, law, heinrich, ewald, all, of, them, were, dismissed, and, three, of, them, were, expelled, but, ewald, and, weber, could, stay, in, g, ttingen, gauss, was, deeply, affected, by, this, quarrel, but, saw, no, possibility, to, help, them, gauss, took, part, in, academic, administration, three, times, he, was, elected, as, dean, of, the, faculty, of, philosophy, being, entrusted, with, the, widow, s, pension, fund, of, the, university, he, dealt, with, actuarial, science, and, wrote, a, report, on, the, strategy, for, stabilizing, the, benefits, he, was, appointed, director, of, the, royal, academy, of, sciences, in, g, ttingen, for, nine, years, gauss, remained, mentally, active, into, his, old, age, even, while, suffering, from, gout, and, general, unhappiness, on, 23, february, 1855, he, died, of, a, heart, attack, in, g, ttingen, and, was, interred, in, the, albani, cemetery, there, heinrich, ewald, gauss, s, son, in, law, and, wolfgang, sartorius, von, waltershausen, gauss, s, close, friend, and, biographer, gave, eulogies, at, his, funeral, gauss, was, a, successful, investor, and, accumulated, considerable, wealth, with, stocks, and, securities, finally, a, value, of, more, than, 150, thousand, thaler, after, his, death, about, 18, thousand, thaler, were, found, hidden, in, his, rooms, the, day, after, gauss, s, death, his, brain, was, removed, preserved, and, studied, by, rudolf, wagner, who, found, its, mass, to, be, slightly, above, average, at, 1, 492, grams, 3, 29, lb, wagner, s, son, hermann, a, geographer, estimated, the, cerebral, area, to, be, 219, 588, square, millimetres, 340, 362, sq, in, in, his, doctoral, thesis, in, 2013, a, neurobiologist, at, the, max, planck, institute, for, biophysical, chemistry, in, g, ttingen, discovered, that, gauss, s, brain, had, been, mixed, up, soon, after, the, first, investigations, due, to, mislabelling, with, that, of, the, physician, conrad, heinrich, fuchs, who, died, in, g, ttingen, a, few, months, after, gauss, a, further, investigation, showed, no, remarkable, anomalies, in, the, brains, of, both, persons, thus, all, investigations, on, gauss, s, brain, until, 1998, except, the, first, ones, of, rudolf, and, hermann, wagner, actually, refer, to, the, brain, of, fuchs, gauss, married, johanna, osthoff, on, 9, october, 1805, in, st, catherine, s, church, in, brunswick, they, had, two, sons, and, one, daughter, joseph, 1806, 1873, wilhelmina, 1808, 1840, and, louis, 1809, 1810, johanna, died, on, 11, october, 1809, one, month, after, the, birth, of, louis, who, himself, died, a, few, months, later, gauss, chose, the, first, names, of, his, children, in, honour, of, giuseppe, piazzi, wilhelm, olbers, and, karl, ludwig, harding, the, discoverers, of, the, first, asteroids, on, 4, august, 1810, the, widower, married, wilhelmine, minna, waldeck, a, friend, of, his, first, wife, with, whom, he, had, three, more, children, eugen, later, eugene, 1811, 1896, wilhelm, later, william, 1813, 1879, and, therese, 1816, 1864, minna, gauss, died, on, 12, september, 1831, after, being, seriously, ill, for, more, than, a, decade, therese, then, took, over, the, household, and, cared, for, gauss, for, the, rest, of, his, life, after, her, father, s, death, she, married, actor, constantin, staufenau, her, sister, wilhelmina, married, the, orientalist, heinrich, ewald, gauss, s, mother, dorothea, lived, in, his, house, from, 1817, until, she, died, in, 1839, the, eldest, son, joseph, while, still, a, schoolboy, helped, his, father, as, an, assistant, during, the, survey, campaign, in, the, summer, of, 1821, after, a, short, time, at, university, in, 1824, joseph, joined, the, hanoverian, army, and, assisted, in, surveying, again, in, 1829, in, the, 1830s, he, was, responsible, for, the, enlargement, of, the, survey, network, to, the, western, parts, of, the, kingdom, with, his, geodetical, qualifications, he, left, the, service, and, engaged, in, the, construction, of, the, railway, network, as, director, of, the, royal, hanoverian, state, railways, in, 1836, he, studied, the, railroad, system, in, the, us, for, some, months, eugen, left, g, ttingen, in, september, 1830, and, emigrated, to, the, united, states, where, he, joined, the, army, for, five, years, he, then, worked, for, the, american, fur, company, in, the, midwest, later, he, moved, to, missouri, and, became, a, successful, businessman, wilhelm, married, a, niece, of, the, astronomer, bessel, he, then, moved, to, missouri, started, as, a, farmer, and, became, wealthy, in, the, shoe, business, in, st, louis, in, later, years, eugene, and, william, have, numerous, descendants, in, america, but, the, gauss, descendants, left, in, germany, all, derive, from, joseph, as, the, daughters, had, no, children, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 19th, century, gauss, was, the, only, important, mathematician, in, germany, comparable, to, the, leading, french, ones, his, disquisitiones, arithmeticae, was, the, first, mathematical, book, from, germany, to, be, translated, into, the, french, language, gauss, was, in, front, of, the, new, development, with, documented, research, since, 1799, his, wealth, of, new, ideas, and, his, rigour, of, demonstration, whereas, previous, mathematicians, like, leonhard, euler, let, the, readers, take, part, in, their, reasoning, for, new, ideas, including, certain, erroneous, deviations, from, the, correct, path, gauss, however, introduced, a, new, style, of, direct, and, complete, explanation, that, did, not, attempt, to, show, the, reader, the, author, s, train, of, thought, gauss, was, the, first, to, restore, that, rigor, of, demonstration, which, we, admire, in, the, ancients, and, which, had, been, forced, unduly, into, the, background, by, the, exclusive, interest, of, the, preceding, period, in, new, developments, but, for, himself, he, propagated, a, quite, different, ideal, given, in, a, letter, to, farkas, bolyai, as, follows, it, is, not, knowledge, but, the, act, of, learning, not, possession, but, the, act, of, getting, there, which, grants, the, greatest, enjoyment, when, i, have, clarified, and, exhausted, a, subject, then, i, turn, away, from, it, in, order, to, go, into, darkness, again, the, posthumous, papers, his, scientific, diary, and, short, glosses, in, his, own, textbooks, show, that, he, worked, to, a, great, extent, in, an, empirical, way, he, was, a, lifelong, busy, and, enthusiastic, calculator, who, made, his, calculations, with, extraordinary, rapidity, mostly, without, precise, controlling, but, checked, the, results, by, masterly, estimation, nevertheless, his, calculations, were, not, always, free, from, mistakes, he, coped, with, the, enormous, workload, by, using, skillful, tools, gauss, used, a, lot, of, mathematical, tables, examined, their, exactness, and, constructed, new, tables, on, various, matters, for, personal, use, he, developed, new, tools, for, effective, calculation, for, example, the, gaussian, elimination, it, has, been, taken, as, a, curious, feature, of, his, working, style, that, he, carried, out, calculations, with, a, high, degree, of, precision, much, more, than, required, and, prepared, tables, with, more, decimal, places, than, ever, requested, for, practical, purposes, very, likely, this, method, gave, him, a, lot, of, material, which, he, used, in, finding, theorems, in, number, theory, gauss, refused, to, publish, work, that, he, did, not, consider, complete, and, above, criticism, this, perfectionism, was, in, keeping, with, the, motto, of, his, personal, seal, pauca, sed, matura, few, but, ripe, many, colleagues, encouraged, him, to, publicize, new, ideas, and, sometimes, rebuked, him, if, he, hesitated, too, long, in, their, opinion, gauss, defended, himself, claiming, that, the, initial, discovery, of, ideas, was, easy, but, preparing, a, presentable, elaboration, was, a, demanding, matter, for, him, for, either, lack, of, time, or, serenity, of, mind, nevertheless, he, published, many, short, communications, of, urgent, content, in, various, journals, but, left, a, considerable, literary, estate, too, gauss, referred, to, mathematics, as, the, queen, of, sciences, and, arithmetics, as, the, queen, of, mathematics, and, supposedly, once, espoused, a, belief, in, the, necessity, of, immediately, understanding, euler, s, identity, as, a, benchmark, pursuant, to, becoming, a, first, class, mathematician, on, certain, occasions, gauss, claimed, that, the, ideas, of, another, scholar, had, already, been, in, his, possession, previously, thus, his, concept, of, priority, as, the, first, to, discover, not, the, first, to, publish, differed, from, that, of, his, scientific, contemporaries, in, contrast, to, his, perfectionism, in, presenting, mathematical, ideas, he, was, criticized, for, a, negligent, way, of, quoting, he, justified, himself, with, a, very, special, view, of, correct, quoting, if, he, gave, references, then, only, in, a, quite, complete, way, with, respect, to, the, previous, authors, of, importance, which, no, one, should, ignore, but, quoting, in, this, way, needed, knowledge, of, the, history, of, science, and, more, time, than, he, wished, to, spend, soon, after, gauss, s, death, his, friend, sartorius, published, the, first, biography, 1856, written, in, a, rather, enthusiastic, style, sartorius, saw, him, as, a, serene, and, forward, striving, man, with, childlike, modesty, but, also, of, iron, character, with, an, unshakeable, strength, of, mind, apart, from, his, closer, circle, others, regarded, him, as, reserved, and, unapproachable, like, an, olympian, sitting, enthroned, on, the, summit, of, science, his, close, contemporaries, agreed, that, gauss, was, a, man, of, difficult, character, he, often, refused, to, accept, compliments, his, visitors, were, occasionally, irritated, by, his, grumpy, behaviour, but, a, short, time, later, his, mood, could, change, and, he, would, become, a, charming, open, minded, host, gauss, abominated, polemic, natures, together, with, his, colleague, hausmann, he, opposed, to, a, call, for, justus, liebig, on, a, university, chair, in, g, ttingen, because, he, was, always, involved, in, some, polemic, gauss, s, life, was, overshadowed, by, severe, problems, in, his, family, when, his, first, wife, johanna, suddenly, died, shortly, after, the, birth, of, their, third, child, he, revealed, the, grief, in, a, last, letter, to, his, dead, wife, in, the, style, of, an, ancient, threnody, the, most, personal, surviving, document, of, gauss, the, situation, worsened, when, tuberculosis, ultimately, destroyed, the, health, of, his, second, wife, minna, over, 13, years, both, his, daughters, later, suffered, from, the, same, disease, gauss, himself, gave, only, slight, hints, of, his, distress, in, a, letter, to, bessel, dated, december, 1831, he, described, himself, as, the, victim, of, the, worst, domestic, sufferings, by, reason, of, his, wife, s, illness, both, younger, sons, were, educated, for, some, years, in, celle, far, from, g, ttingen, the, military, career, of, his, elder, son, joseph, ended, after, more, than, two, decades, with, the, rank, of, a, poorly, paid, first, lieutenant, although, he, had, acquired, a, considerable, knowledge, of, geodesy, he, needed, financial, support, from, his, father, even, after, he, was, married, the, second, son, eugen, shared, a, good, measure, of, his, father, s, talent, in, computation, and, languages, but, had, a, vivacious, and, sometimes, rebellious, character, he, wanted, to, study, philology, whereas, gauss, wanted, him, to, become, a, lawyer, having, run, up, debts, and, caused, a, scandal, in, public, eugen, suddenly, left, g, ttingen, under, dramatic, circumstances, in, september, 1830, and, emigrated, via, bremen, to, the, united, states, he, wasted, the, little, money, he, had, taken, to, start, after, which, his, father, refused, further, financial, support, the, youngest, son, wilhelm, wanted, to, qualify, for, agricultural, administration, but, had, difficulties, getting, an, appropriate, education, and, eventually, emigrated, as, well, only, gauss, s, youngest, daughter, therese, accompanied, him, in, his, last, years, of, life, collecting, numerical, data, on, very, different, things, useful, or, useless, became, a, habit, in, his, later, years, for, example, the, number, of, paths, from, his, home, to, certain, places, in, g, ttingen, or, the, number, of, living, days, of, persons, he, congratulated, humboldt, in, december, 1851, for, having, reached, the, same, age, as, isaac, newton, at, his, death, calculated, in, days, similar, to, his, excellent, knowledge, of, latin, he, was, also, acquainted, with, modern, languages, at, the, age, of, 62, he, began, to, teach, himself, russian, very, likely, to, understand, scientific, writings, from, russia, among, them, those, of, lobachevsky, on, non, euclidean, geometry, gauss, read, both, classical, and, modern, literature, and, english, and, french, works, in, the, original, languages, his, favorite, english, author, was, walter, scott, his, favorite, german, jean, paul, gauss, liked, singing, and, went, to, concerts, he, was, a, busy, newspaper, reader, in, his, last, years, he, used, to, visit, an, academic, press, salon, of, the, university, every, noon, gauss, did, not, care, much, for, philosophy, and, mocked, the, splitting, hairs, of, the, so, called, metaphysicians, by, which, he, meant, proponents, of, the, contemporary, school, of, naturphilosophie, gauss, had, an, aristocratic, and, through, and, through, conservative, nature, with, little, respect, for, people, s, intelligence, and, morals, following, the, motto, mundus, vult, decipi, he, disliked, napoleon, and, his, system, and, all, kinds, of, violence, and, revolution, caused, horror, to, him, thus, he, condemned, the, methods, of, the, revolutions, of, 1848, though, he, agreed, with, some, of, their, aims, such, as, the, idea, of, a, unified, germany, as, far, as, the, political, system, is, concerned, he, had, a, low, estimation, of, the, constitutional, system, he, criticized, parliamentarians, of, his, time, for, a, lack, of, knowledge, and, logical, errors, some, gauss, biographers, have, speculated, on, his, religious, beliefs, he, sometimes, said, god, arithmetizes, and, i, succeeded, not, on, account, of, my, hard, efforts, but, by, the, grace, of, the, lord, gauss, was, a, member, of, the, lutheran, church, like, most, of, the, population, in, northern, germany, it, seems, that, he, did, not, believe, all, dogmas, or, understand, the, holy, bible, quite, literally, sartorius, mentioned, gauss, s, religious, tolerance, and, estimated, his, insatiable, thirst, for, truth, and, his, sense, of, justice, as, motivated, by, religious, convictions, in, his, doctoral, thesis, from, 1799, gauss, proved, the, fundamental, theorem, of, algebra, which, states, that, every, non, constant, single, variable, polynomial, with, complex, coefficients, has, at, least, one, complex, root, mathematicians, including, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, had, produced, false, proofs, before, him, and, gauss, s, dissertation, contains, a, critique, of, d, alembert, s, work, he, subsequently, produced, three, other, proofs, the, last, one, in, 1849, being, generally, rigorous, his, attempts, clarified, the, concept, of, complex, numbers, considerably, along, the, way, in, the, preface, to, the, disquisitiones, gauss, dates, the, beginning, of, his, work, on, number, theory, to, 1795, by, studying, the, works, of, previous, mathematicians, like, fermat, euler, lagrange, and, legendre, he, realized, that, these, scholars, had, already, found, much, of, what, he, had, discovered, by, himself, the, disquisitiones, arithmeticae, written, since, 1798, and, published, in, 1801, consolidated, number, theory, as, a, discipline, and, covered, both, elementary, and, algebraic, number, theory, therein, he, introduces, the, triple, bar, symbol, for, congruence, and, uses, it, for, a, clean, presentation, of, modular, arithmetic, it, deals, with, the, unique, factorization, theorem, and, primitive, roots, modulo, n, in, the, main, chapters, gauss, presents, the, first, two, proofs, of, the, law, of, quadratic, reciprocity, and, develops, the, theories, of, binary, and, ternary, quadratic, forms, the, disquisitiones, include, the, gauss, composition, law, for, binary, quadratic, forms, as, well, as, the, enumeration, of, the, number, of, representations, of, an, integer, as, the, sum, of, three, squares, as, an, almost, immediate, corollary, of, his, theorem, on, three, squares, he, proves, the, triangular, case, of, the, fermat, polygonal, number, theorem, for, n, 3, from, several, analytic, results, on, class, numbers, that, gauss, gives, without, proof, towards, the, end, of, the, fifth, chapter, it, appears, that, gauss, already, knew, the, class, number, formula, in, 1801, in, the, last, chapter, gauss, gives, proof, for, the, constructibility, of, a, regular, heptadecagon, 17, sided, polygon, with, straightedge, and, compass, by, reducing, this, geometrical, problem, to, an, algebraic, one, he, shows, that, a, regular, polygon, is, constructible, if, the, number, of, its, sides, is, either, a, power, of, 2, or, the, product, of, a, power, of, 2, and, any, number, of, distinct, fermat, primes, in, the, same, chapter, he, gives, a, result, on, the, number, of, solutions, of, certain, cubic, polynomials, with, coefficients, in, finite, fields, which, amounts, to, counting, integral, points, on, an, elliptic, curve, an, unfinished, eight, chapter, was, found, among, left, papers, only, after, his, death, consisting, of, work, done, during, 1797, 1799, one, of, gauss, s, first, results, was, the, empirically, found, conjecture, of, 1792, the, later, called, prime, number, theorem, giving, an, estimation, of, the, number, of, prime, numbers, by, using, the, integral, logarithm, when, olbers, encouraged, gauss, in, 1816, to, compete, for, a, prize, from, the, french, academy, on, proof, for, fermat, s, last, theorem, flt, he, refused, because, of, his, low, esteem, on, this, matter, however, among, his, left, works, a, short, undated, paper, was, found, with, proofs, of, flt, for, the, cases, n, 3, and, n, 5, the, particular, case, of, n, 3, was, proved, much, earlier, by, leonhard, euler, but, gauss, developed, a, more, streamlined, proof, which, made, use, of, eisenstein, integers, though, more, general, the, proof, was, simpler, than, in, the, real, integers, case, gauss, contributed, to, solving, the, kepler, conjecture, in, 1831, with, the, proof, that, a, greatest, packing, density, of, spheres, in, the, three, dimensional, space, is, given, when, the, centers, of, the, spheres, form, a, cubic, face, centered, arrangement, when, he, reviewed, a, book, of, ludwig, august, seeber, on, the, theory, of, reduction, of, positive, ternary, quadratic, forms, having, noticed, some, lacks, in, seeber, s, proof, he, simplified, many, of, his, arguments, proved, the, central, conjecture, and, remarked, that, this, theorem, is, equivalent, to, the, kepler, conjecture, for, regular, arrangements, in, two, papers, on, biquadratic, residues, 1828, 1832, gauss, introduced, the, ring, of, gaussian, integers, z, i, displaystyle, mathbb, z, showed, that, it, is, a, unique, factorization, domain, and, generalized, some, key, arithmetic, concepts, such, as, fermat, s, little, theorem, and, gauss, s, lemma, the, main, objective, of, introducing, this, ring, was, to, formulate, the, law, of, biquadratic, reciprocity, as, gauss, discovered, rings, of, complex, integers, are, the, natural, setting, for, such, higher, reciprocity, laws, in, the, second, paper, he, stated, the, general, law, of, biquadratic, reciprocity, and, proved, several, special, cases, of, it, in, an, earlier, publication, from, 1818, containing, his, fifth, and, sixth, proofs, of, quadratic, reciprocity, he, claimed, the, techniques, of, these, proofs, gauss, sums, can, be, applied, to, prove, higher, reciprocity, laws, one, of, gauss, s, first, discoveries, was, the, notion, of, the, arithmetic, geometric, mean, agm, of, two, positive, real, numbers, he, discovered, its, relation, to, elliptic, integrals, in, the, years, 1798, 1799, through, the, landen, s, transformation, and, a, diary, entry, recorded, the, discovery, of, the, connection, of, gauss, s, constant, to, lemniscatic, elliptic, functions, a, result, that, gauss, stated, that, will, surely, open, an, entirely, new, field, of, analysis, he, also, made, early, inroads, into, the, more, formal, issues, of, the, foundations, of, complex, analysis, and, from, a, letter, to, bessel, in, 1811, it, is, clear, that, he, knew, the, fundamental, theorem, of, complex, analysis, cauchy, s, integral, theorem, and, understood, the, notion, of, complex, residues, when, integrating, around, poles, euler, s, pentagonal, numbers, theorem, together, with, other, researches, on, the, agm, and, lemniscatic, functions, led, him, to, plenty, of, results, on, jacobi, theta, functions, culminating, in, the, discovery, in, 1808, of, the, later, called, jacobi, triple, product, identity, which, includes, euler, s, theorem, as, a, special, case, his, works, show, that, he, knew, modular, transformations, of, order, 3, 5, 7, for, elliptic, functions, since, 1808, several, mathematical, fragments, in, his, nachlass, indicate, that, he, knew, parts, of, the, modern, theory, of, modular, forms, in, his, work, on, the, multivalued, agm, of, two, complex, numbers, he, discovered, a, deep, connection, between, the, infinitely, many, values, of, the, agm, to, its, two, simplest, values, in, his, unpublished, writings, he, recognized, and, made, a, sketch, of, the, key, concept, of, fundamental, domain, for, the, modular, group, one, of, gauss, s, sketches, of, this, kind, was, a, drawing, of, a, tessellation, of, the, unit, disk, by, equilateral, hyperbolic, triangles, with, all, angles, equal, to, 4, displaystyle, pi, 4, an, example, of, gauss, s, insight, in, the, fields, of, analysis, is, the, cryptic, remark, that, the, principles, of, circle, division, by, compass, and, straightedge, can, also, be, applied, to, the, division, of, the, lemniscate, curve, which, inspired, abel, s, theorem, on, lemniscate, division, another, example, is, his, publication, summatio, quarundam, serierum, singularium, 1811, on, the, determination, of, the, sign, of, quadratic, gauss, sum, in, which, he, solved, the, main, problem, by, introducing, q, analogs, of, binomial, coefficients, and, manipulating, them, by, several, original, identities, that, seem, to, stem, out, of, his, work, on, elliptic, functions, theory, however, gauss, cast, his, argument, in, a, formal, way, that, does, not, reveal, its, origin, in, elliptic, functions, theory, and, only, the, later, work, of, mathematicians, such, as, jacobi, and, hermite, has, exposed, the, crux, of, his, argument, in, the, disquisitiones, generales, circa, series, infinitam, 1813, he, provides, the, first, systematic, treatment, of, the, general, hypergeometric, function, f, x, displaystyle, f, alpha, beta, gamma, x, and, shows, that, many, of, the, functions, known, at, the, time, are, special, cases, of, the, hypergeometric, function, this, work, is, the, first, one, with, an, exact, inquiry, of, convergence, of, infinite, series, in, the, history, of, mathematics, furthermore, it, deals, with, infinite, continued, fractions, arising, as, ratios, of, hypergeometric, functions, which, are, now, called, gauss, continued, fractions, in, 1823, gauss, won, the, prize, of, the, danish, society, with, an, essay, on, conformal, mappings, which, contains, several, developments, that, pertain, to, the, field, of, complex, analysis, gauss, stated, that, angle, preserving, mappings, in, the, complex, plane, must, be, complex, analytic, functions, and, used, the, later, called, beltrami, equation, to, prove, the, existence, of, isothermal, coordinates, on, analytic, surfaces, the, essay, concludes, with, examples, of, conformal, mappings, into, a, sphere, and, an, ellipsoid, of, revolution, gauss, often, deduced, theorems, inductively, from, numerical, data, he, had, collected, empirically, as, such, the, use, of, efficient, algorithms, to, facilitate, calculations, was, vital, to, his, research, and, he, made, many, contributions, to, numeric, analysis, as, the, method, of, gaussian, quadrature, published, in, 1816, in, a, private, letter, to, gerling, from, 1823, he, described, a, solution, of, a, 4x4, system, of, linear, equations, by, using, gauss, seidel, method, an, indirect, iterative, method, for, the, solution, of, linear, systems, and, recommended, it, over, the, usual, method, of, direct, elimination, for, systems, of, more, than, two, equations, gauss, invented, an, algorithm, for, calculating, what, is, now, called, discrete, fourier, transforms, when, calculating, the, orbits, of, pallas, and, juno, in, 1805, 160, years, before, cooley, and, tukey, found, their, similar, cooley, tukey, fft, algorithm, he, developed, it, as, a, trigonometric, interpolation, method, but, the, paper, theoria, interpolationis, methodo, nova, tractata, was, published, only, posthumously, in, 1876, preceded, by, the, first, presentation, by, joseph, fourier, on, the, subject, in, 1807, the, first, publication, following, the, doctoral, thesis, dealt, with, the, determination, of, the, date, of, easter, 1800, an, elementary, matter, of, mathematics, gauss, aimed, to, present, a, most, convenient, algorithm, for, people, without, any, knowledge, of, ecclesiastical, or, even, astronomical, chronology, and, thus, avoided, the, usually, required, terms, of, golden, number, epact, solar, cycle, domenical, letter, and, any, religious, connotations, biographers, speculated, on, the, reason, why, gauss, dealt, with, this, matter, but, it, is, likely, comprehensible, by, the, historical, background, the, replacement, of, the, julian, calendar, by, the, gregorian, calendar, had, caused, confusion, in, the, holy, roman, empire, since, the, 16th, century, and, was, not, finished, in, germany, until, 1700, when, the, difference, of, eleven, days, was, deleted, but, the, difference, in, calculating, the, date, of, easter, remained, between, protestant, and, catholic, territories, a, further, agreement, of, 1776, equalized, the, confessional, way, of, counting, thus, in, the, protestant, states, like, the, duchy, of, brunswick, the, easter, of, 1777, five, weeks, before, gauss, s, birth, was, the, first, one, calculated, in, the, new, manner, the, public, difficulties, of, replacement, may, be, the, historical, background, for, the, confusion, on, this, matter, in, the, gauss, family, see, chapter, anecdotes, for, being, connected, with, the, easter, regulations, an, essay, on, the, date, of, pesach, followed, soon, in, 1802, on, 1, january, 1801, italian, astronomer, giuseppe, piazzi, discovered, a, new, celestial, object, presumed, it, to, be, the, long, searched, planet, between, mars, and, jupiter, according, to, the, so, called, titius, bode, law, and, named, it, ceres, he, could, track, it, only, for, a, short, time, until, it, disappeared, behind, the, glare, of, the, sun, the, mathematical, tools, of, the, time, were, not, sufficient, to, extrapolate, a, position, from, the, few, data, for, its, reappearance, gauss, tackled, the, problem, and, predicted, a, position, for, possible, rediscovery, in, december, 1801, this, turned, out, to, be, accurate, within, a, half, degree, when, franz, xaver, von, zach, on, 7, and, 31, december, at, gotha, and, independently, heinrich, olbers, on, 1, and, 2, january, in, bremen, identified, the, object, near, the, predicted, position, gauss, s, method, leads, to, an, equation, of, the, eighth, degree, of, which, one, solution, the, earth, s, orbit, is, known, the, solution, sought, is, then, separated, from, the, remaining, six, based, on, physical, conditions, in, this, work, gauss, used, comprehensive, approximation, methods, which, he, created, for, that, purpose, the, discovery, of, ceres, led, gauss, to, the, theory, of, the, motion, of, planetoids, disturbed, by, large, planets, eventually, published, in, 1809, as, theoria, motus, corporum, coelestium, in, sectionibus, conicis, solem, ambientum, it, introduced, the, gaussian, gravitational, constant, since, the, new, asteroids, had, been, discovered, gauss, occupied, himself, with, the, perturbations, of, their, orbital, elements, firstly, he, examined, ceres, with, analytical, methods, similar, to, those, of, laplace, but, his, favorite, object, was, pallas, because, of, its, great, eccentricity, and, orbital, inclination, whereby, laplace, s, method, did, not, work, gauss, used, his, own, tools, the, arithmetic, geometric, mean, the, hypergeometric, function, and, his, method, of, interpolation, he, found, an, orbital, resonance, with, jupiter, in, proportion, 18, 7, in, 1812, gauss, gave, this, result, as, cipher, and, gave, the, explicit, meaning, only, in, letters, to, olbers, and, bessel, after, long, years, of, work, he, finished, it, in, 1816, without, a, result, that, seemed, sufficient, to, him, this, marked, the, end, of, his, activities, in, theoretical, astronomy, one, fruit, of, gauss, s, research, on, pallas, perturbations, was, the, determinatio, attractionis, 1818, on, a, method, of, theoretical, astronomy, that, later, became, known, as, the, elliptic, ring, method, it, introduced, an, averaging, conception, in, which, a, planet, in, orbit, is, replaced, by, a, fictitious, ring, with, mass, density, proportional, to, the, time, taking, the, planet, to, follow, the, corresponding, orbital, arcs, gauss, presents, the, method, of, evaluating, the, gravitational, attraction, of, such, an, elliptic, ring, which, includes, several, steps, one, of, them, involves, a, direct, application, of, the, arithmetic, geometric, mean, agm, algorithm, to, calculate, an, elliptic, integral, while, gauss, s, contributions, to, theoretical, astronomy, came, to, an, end, more, practical, activities, in, observational, astronomy, continued, and, occupied, him, during, his, entire, career, even, early, in, 1799, gauss, dealt, with, the, determination, of, longitude, by, use, of, the, lunar, parallax, for, which, he, developed, more, convenient, formulas, than, those, were, in, common, use, after, appointment, as, director, of, observatory, he, attached, importance, to, the, fundamental, astronomical, constants, in, correspondence, with, bessel, gauss, himself, provided, tables, for, nutation, and, aberration, the, solar, coordinates, and, refraction, he, made, many, contributions, to, spherical, geometry, and, in, this, context, solved, some, practical, problems, about, navigation, by, stars, he, published, a, great, number, of, observations, mainly, on, minor, planets, and, comets, his, last, observation, was, the, solar, eclipse, of, 28, july, 1851, gauss, likely, used, the, method, of, least, squares, for, calculating, the, orbit, of, ceres, to, minimize, the, impact, of, measurement, error, the, method, was, published, first, by, adrien, marie, legendre, in, 1805, but, gauss, claimed, in, theoria, motus, 1809, that, he, had, been, using, it, since, 1794, or, 1795, in, the, history, of, statistics, this, disagreement, is, called, the, priority, dispute, over, the, discovery, of, the, method, of, least, squares, gauss, proved, that, the, method, has, the, lowest, sampling, variance, within, the, class, of, linear, unbiased, estimators, under, the, assumption, of, normally, distributed, errors, gauss, markov, theorem, in, the, two, part, paper, theoria, combinationis, observationum, erroribus, minimis, obnoxiae, 1823, in, the, first, paper, he, proved, gauss, s, inequality, a, chebyshev, type, inequality, for, unimodal, distributions, and, stated, without, proof, another, inequality, for, moments, of, the, fourth, order, a, special, case, of, gauss, winckler, inequality, he, derived, lower, and, upper, bounds, for, the, variance, of, sample, variance, in, the, second, paper, gauss, described, recursive, least, squares, methods, his, work, on, the, theory, of, errors, was, extended, in, several, directions, by, the, geodesist, friedrich, robert, helmert, to, the, gauss, helmert, model, gauss, also, contributed, to, problems, in, probability, theory, that, are, not, directly, concerned, with, the, theory, of, errors, one, example, appears, as, a, diary, note, where, he, tried, to, describe, the, asymptotic, distribution, of, entries, in, the, continued, fraction, expansion, of, a, random, number, uniformly, distributed, in, 0, 1, he, derived, this, distribution, now, known, as, the, gauss, kuzmin, distribution, as, a, by, product, of, the, discovery, of, the, ergodicity, of, the, gauss, map, for, continued, fractions, gauss, s, solution, is, the, first, ever, result, in, the, metrical, theory, of, continued, fractions, gauss, was, busy, with, geodetic, problems, since, 1799, when, he, helped, karl, ludwig, von, lecoq, with, calculations, during, his, survey, in, westphalia, beginning, in, 1804, he, taught, himself, some, geodetic, practise, with, a, sextant, in, brunswick, and, g, ttingen, since, 1816, gauss, s, former, student, heinrich, christian, schumacher, then, professor, in, copenhagen, but, living, in, altona, holstein, near, hamburg, as, head, of, an, observatory, carried, out, a, triangulation, of, the, jutland, peninsula, from, skagen, in, the, north, to, lauenburg, in, the, south, this, project, was, the, basis, for, map, production, but, also, aimed, at, determining, the, geodetic, arc, between, the, terminal, sites, data, from, geodetic, arcs, were, used, to, determine, the, dimensions, of, the, earth, geoid, and, long, arc, distances, brought, more, precise, results, schumacher, asked, gauss, to, continue, this, work, further, to, the, south, in, the, kingdom, of, hanover, gauss, agreed, after, a, short, time, of, hesitation, finally, in, may, 1820, king, george, iv, gave, the, order, to, gauss, an, arc, measurement, needs, a, precise, astronomical, determination, of, at, least, two, points, in, the, network, gauss, and, schumacher, used, the, favourite, occasion, that, both, observatories, in, g, ttingen, and, altona, in, the, garden, of, schumacher, s, house, laid, nearly, in, the, same, longitude, the, latitude, was, measured, with, both, their, instruments, and, a, zenith, sector, of, ramsden, that, was, transported, to, both, observatories, gauss, and, schumacher, had, already, determined, some, angles, between, l, neburg, hamburg, and, lauenburg, for, the, geodetic, connection, in, october, 1818, during, the, summers, of, 1821, until, 1825, gauss, directed, the, triangulation, work, personally, from, thuringia, in, the, south, to, the, river, elbe, in, the, north, the, triangle, between, hoher, hagen, gro, er, inselsberg, in, the, thuringian, forest, and, brocken, in, the, harz, mountains, was, the, largest, one, gauss, had, ever, measured, with, a, maximum, size, of, 107, km, 66, 5, miles, in, the, thinly, populated, l, neburg, heath, without, significant, natural, summits, or, artificial, buildings, he, had, difficulties, finding, suitable, triangulation, points, sometimes, cutting, lanes, through, the, vegetation, was, necessary, for, pointing, signals, gauss, invented, a, new, instrument, with, movable, mirrors, and, a, small, telescope, that, reflects, the, sunbeams, to, the, triangulation, points, and, named, it, heliotrope, another, suitable, construction, for, the, same, purpose, was, a, sextant, with, an, additional, mirror, which, he, named, vice, heliotrope, gauss, got, assistance, by, soldiers, of, the, hanoverian, army, among, them, his, eldest, son, joseph, gauss, took, part, in, the, baseline, measurement, braak, base, line, of, schumacher, in, the, village, of, braak, near, hamburg, in, 1820, and, used, the, result, for, the, evaluation, of, the, hanoverian, triangulation, an, additional, result, was, a, better, value, of, flattening, of, the, approximative, earth, ellipsoid, gauss, developed, the, universal, transverse, mercator, projection, of, the, ellipsoidal, shaped, earth, what, he, named, conform, projection, for, representing, geodetical, data, in, plane, charts, when, the, arc, measurement, was, finished, gauss, began, the, enlargement, of, the, triangulation, to, the, west, to, get, a, survey, of, the, whole, kingdom, of, hanover, with, a, royal, decree, from, 25, march, 1828, the, practical, work, was, directed, by, three, army, officers, among, them, lieutenant, joseph, gauss, the, complete, data, evaluation, laid, in, the, hands, of, gauss, who, applied, his, mathematical, inventions, such, as, the, method, of, least, squares, and, the, elimination, method, to, it, the, project, was, finished, in, 1844, and, gauss, sent, a, final, report, of, the, project, to, the, government, his, method, of, projection, was, not, edited, until, 1866, in, 1828, when, studying, differences, in, latitude, gauss, first, defined, a, physical, approximation, for, the, figure, of, the, earth, as, the, surface, everywhere, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, gravity, later, his, doctoral, student, johann, benedict, listing, called, this, the, geoid, the, geodetic, survey, of, hanover, fueled, gauss, s, interest, in, differential, geometry, and, topology, fields, of, mathematics, dealing, with, curves, and, surfaces, this, led, him, in, 1828, to, the, publication, of, a, memoir, that, marks, the, birth, of, modern, differential, geometry, of, surfaces, as, it, departed, from, the, traditional, ways, of, treating, surfaces, as, cartesian, graphs, of, functions, of, two, variables, and, that, initiated, the, exploration, of, surfaces, from, the, inner, point, of, view, of, a, two, dimensional, being, constrained, to, move, on, it, as, a, result, the, theorema, egregium, remarkable, theorem, established, a, property, of, the, notion, of, gaussian, curvature, informally, the, theorem, says, that, the, curvature, of, a, surface, can, be, determined, entirely, by, measuring, angles, and, distances, on, the, surface, regardless, of, the, embedding, of, the, surface, in, three, dimensional, or, two, dimensional, space, the, theorema, egregium, leads, to, the, abstraction, of, surfaces, as, doubly, extended, manifolds, it, clarifies, the, distinction, between, the, intrinsic, properties, of, the, manifold, the, metric, and, its, physical, realization, in, ambient, space, a, consequence, is, the, impossibility, of, an, isometric, transformation, between, surfaces, of, different, gaussian, curvature, this, means, practically, that, a, sphere, or, an, ellipsoid, cannot, be, transformed, to, a, plane, without, distortion, which, causes, a, fundamental, problem, in, designing, projections, for, geographical, maps, a, portion, of, this, essay, is, dedicated, to, a, profound, study, of, geodesics, in, particular, gauss, proves, the, local, gauss, bonnet, theorem, on, geodesic, triangles, and, generalizes, legendre, s, theorem, on, spherical, triangles, to, geodesic, triangles, on, arbitrary, surfaces, with, continuous, curvature, he, found, that, the, angles, of, a, sufficiently, small, geodesic, triangle, deviate, from, that, of, a, planar, triangle, of, the, same, sides, in, a, way, that, depends, only, on, the, values, of, the, surface, curvature, at, the, vertices, of, the, triangle, regardless, of, the, behaviour, of, the, surface, in, the, triangle, interior, gauss, s, memoir, from, 1828, lacks, the, conception, of, geodesic, curvature, however, in, a, previously, unpublished, manuscript, very, likely, written, in, 1822, 1825, he, introduced, the, term, side, curvature, german, seitenkr, mmung, and, proved, its, invariance, under, isometric, transformations, a, result, that, was, later, obtained, by, ferdinand, minding, and, published, by, him, in, 1830, this, gauss, paper, contains, the, core, of, his, lemma, on, total, curvature, but, also, its, generalization, found, and, proved, by, pierre, ossian, bonnet, in, 1848, and, known, as, gauss, bonnet, theorem, in, the, lifetime, of, gauss, a, vivid, discussion, on, the, parallel, postulate, in, euclidean, geometry, was, going, on, numerous, efforts, were, made, to, prove, it, in, the, frame, of, the, euclidean, axioms, whereas, some, mathematicians, discussed, the, possibility, of, geometrical, systems, without, it, gauss, thought, about, the, basics, of, geometry, since, the, 1790s, years, but, in, the, 1810s, he, realized, that, a, non, euclidean, geometry, without, the, parallel, postulate, could, solve, the, problem, in, a, letter, to, franz, taurinus, of, 1824, he, presented, a, short, comprehensible, outline, of, what, he, named, a, non, euclidean, geometry, but, he, strongly, forbade, taurinus, to, make, any, use, of, it, the, first, publications, on, non, euclidean, geometry, in, the, history, of, mathematics, were, authored, by, nikolai, lobachevsky, in, 1829, and, janos, bolyai, in, 1832, in, the, following, years, gauss, wrote, his, ideas, on, the, topic, but, did, not, publish, them, thus, avoiding, influencing, the, contemporary, scientific, discussion, gauss, commended, the, ideas, of, janos, bolyai, in, a, letter, to, his, father, and, university, friend, farkas, bolyai, claiming, that, these, were, congruent, to, his, own, thoughts, of, some, decades, however, it, is, not, quite, clear, to, what, extent, he, preceded, lobachevsky, and, bolyai, as, his, letter, remarks, are, only, vague, and, obscure, sartorius, mentioned, gauss, s, work, on, non, euclidean, geometry, firstly, in, 1856, but, only, the, edition, of, left, papers, in, volume, viii, of, the, collected, works, 1900, showed, gauss, s, ideas, on, that, matter, at, a, time, when, non, euclidean, geometry, had, yet, grown, out, of, controversial, discussion, gauss, was, also, an, early, pioneer, of, topology, or, geometria, situs, as, it, was, called, in, his, lifetime, the, first, proof, of, the, fundamental, theorem, of, algebra, in, 1799, contained, an, essentially, topological, argument, fifty, years, later, he, further, developed, the, topological, argument, in, his, fourth, proof, of, this, theorem, another, encounter, with, topological, notions, occurred, to, him, in, the, course, of, his, astronomical, work, in, 1804, when, he, determined, the, limits, of, the, region, on, the, celestial, sphere, in, which, comets, and, asteroids, might, appear, and, which, he, termed, zodiacus, he, discovered, that, if, the, earth, s, and, comet, s, orbits, are, linked, then, by, topological, reasons, the, zodiacus, is, the, entire, sphere, in, 1848, in, the, context, of, the, discovery, of, the, asteroid, 7, iris, he, published, a, further, qualitative, discussion, of, the, zodiacus, in, gauss, s, letters, of, 1820, 1830, he, thought, intensively, on, topics, with, close, affinity, to, geometria, situs, and, became, gradually, conscious, of, semantic, difficulty, in, this, field, fragments, from, this, period, reveal, that, he, tried, to, classify, tract, figures, which, are, closed, plane, curves, with, a, finite, number, of, transverse, self, intersections, that, may, also, be, planar, projections, of, knots, to, do, so, he, devised, a, symbolical, scheme, the, gauss, code, that, in, a, sense, captured, the, characteristic, features, of, tract, figures, in, a, fragment, from, 1833, gauss, defined, the, linking, number, of, two, space, curves, by, a, certain, double, integral, and, in, doing, so, provided, for, the, first, time, an, analytical, formulation, of, a, topological, phenomenon, on, the, same, note, he, lamented, the, little, progress, made, in, geometria, situs, and, remarked, that, one, of, its, central, problems, will, be, to, count, the, intertwinings, of, two, closed, or, infinite, curves, his, notebooks, from, that, period, reveal, that, he, was, also, thinking, about, other, topological, objects, such, as, braids, and, tangles, gauss, s, influence, in, later, years, to, the, emerging, field, of, topology, which, he, held, in, high, esteem, was, through, occasional, remarks, and, oral, communications, to, mobius, and, listing, gauss, applied, the, concept, of, complex, numbers, to, solve, well, known, problems, in, a, new, concise, way, for, example, in, a, short, note, from, 1836, on, geometric, aspects, of, the, ternary, forms, and, their, application, to, crystallography, he, stated, the, fundamental, theorem, of, axonometry, which, tells, how, to, represent, a, 3d, cube, on, a, 2d, plane, with, complete, accuracy, via, complex, numbers, he, described, rotations, of, this, sphere, as, the, action, of, certain, linear, fractional, transformations, on, the, extended, complex, plane, and, gave, a, proof, for, the, geometric, theorem, that, the, altitudes, of, a, triangle, always, meet, in, a, single, orthocenter, gauss, was, concerned, with, john, napier, s, pentagramma, mirificum, a, certain, spherical, pentagram, for, several, decades, he, approached, it, from, various, points, of, view, and, gradually, gained, a, full, understanding, of, its, geometric, algebraic, and, analytic, aspects, in, particular, in, 1843, he, stated, and, proved, several, theorems, connecting, elliptic, functions, napier, spherical, pentagons, and, poncelet, pentagons, in, the, plane, furthermore, he, contributed, a, solution, to, the, problem, of, constructing, the, largest, area, ellipse, inside, a, given, quadrilateral, and, discovered, a, surprising, result, about, the, computation, of, area, of, pentagons, gauss, had, been, interested, in, magnetism, since, 1803, after, alexander, von, humboldt, visited, g, ttingen, in, 1826, both, scientists, began, intensive, research, on, geomagnetism, partly, independently, partly, in, productive, cooperation, in, 1828, gauss, was, humboldt, s, guest, during, the, conference, of, the, society, of, german, natural, scientists, and, physicians, in, berlin, where, he, got, acquainted, with, the, physicist, wilhelm, weber, when, weber, got, the, chair, for, physics, in, g, ttingen, as, successor, of, johann, tobias, mayer, by, gauss, s, recommendation, in, 1831, both, of, them, started, a, fruitful, collaboration, leading, to, a, new, knowledge, of, magnetism, with, a, representation, for, the, unit, of, magnetism, in, terms, of, mass, charge, and, time, they, founded, the, magnetic, association, german, magnetischer, verein, an, international, working, group, of, several, observatories, which, supported, measurements, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, in, many, regions, of, the, world, with, equal, methods, at, arranged, dates, in, the, years, 1836, to, 1841, in, 1836, humboldt, suggested, the, establishment, of, a, worldwide, net, of, geomagnetic, stations, in, the, british, dominions, with, a, letter, to, the, duke, of, sussex, then, president, of, the, royal, society, he, proposed, that, magnetic, measures, should, be, taken, under, standardized, conditions, using, his, methods, together, with, other, instigators, this, led, to, a, global, program, known, as, magnetical, crusade, under, the, direction, of, edward, sabine, the, dates, times, and, intervals, of, observations, were, determined, in, advance, the, g, ttingen, mean, time, was, used, as, standard, 61, stations, on, all, five, continents, participated, in, this, global, program, gauss, and, weber, founded, a, series, for, publication, of, the, results, six, volumes, were, edited, between, 1837, and, 1843, weber, s, departure, to, leipzig, in, 1843, as, late, effect, of, the, g, ttingen, seven, affair, marked, the, end, of, magnetic, association, activity, following, humboldt, s, example, gauss, ordered, a, magnetic, observatory, to, be, built, in, the, garden, of, the, observatory, but, the, scientists, differed, over, instrumental, equipment, gauss, preferred, stationary, instruments, which, he, thought, to, give, more, precise, results, whereas, humboldt, was, accustomed, to, movable, instruments, gauss, was, interested, in, the, temporal, and, spatial, variation, of, magnetic, declination, inclination, and, intensity, but, discriminated, humboldt, s, concept, of, magnetic, intensity, to, the, terms, of, horizontal, and, vertical, intensity, together, with, weber, he, developed, methods, of, measuring, the, components, of, intensity, of, the, magnetic, field, and, constructed, a, suitable, magnetometer, to, measure, absolute, values, of, the, strength, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, not, more, relative, ones, that, depended, on, the, apparatus, the, precision, of, the, magnetometer, was, about, ten, times, higher, than, of, previous, instruments, with, this, work, gauss, was, the, first, to, derive, a, non, mechanical, quantity, by, basic, mechanical, quantities, gauss, carried, out, a, general, theory, of, terrestrial, magnetism, 1839, in, what, he, believed, to, describe, the, nature, of, magnetic, force, according, to, felix, klein, this, work, is, a, presentation, of, observations, by, use, of, spherical, harmonics, rather, than, a, physical, theory, the, theory, predicted, the, existence, of, exactly, two, magnetic, poles, on, the, earth, thus, hansteen, s, idea, of, four, magnetic, poles, became, obsolete, and, the, data, allowed, to, determine, their, location, with, rather, good, precision, gauss, influenced, the, beginning, of, geophysics, in, russia, when, adolph, theodor, kupffer, one, of, his, former, students, founded, a, magnetic, observatory, in, st, petersburg, following, the, example, of, the, observatory, in, g, ttingen, and, similarly, ivan, simonov, in, kazan, the, discoveries, of, hans, christian, rsted, on, electromagnetism, and, michael, faraday, on, electromagnetic, induction, drew, gauss, s, attention, to, these, matters, gauss, and, weber, found, rules, for, branched, electric, circuits, which, were, later, found, independently, and, firstly, published, by, gustav, kirchhoff, and, benamed, after, him, as, kirchhoff, s, circuit, laws, and, made, inquiries, on, electromagnetism, they, constructed, the, first, electromechanical, telegraph, in, 1833, and, weber, himself, connected, the, observatory, with, the, institute, for, physics, in, the, town, centre, of, g, ttingen, but, they, did, not, care, for, any, further, development, of, this, invention, for, commercial, purposes, gauss, s, main, theoretical, interests, in, electromagnetism, were, reflected, in, his, attempts, to, formulate, quantitive, laws, governing, electromagnetic, induction, in, notebooks, from, these, years, he, recorded, several, innovative, formulations, he, discovered, the, idea, of, vector, potential, function, independently, rediscovered, by, franz, ernst, neumann, in, 1845, and, in, january, 1835, he, wrote, down, an, induction, law, equivalent, to, faraday, s, law, which, stated, that, the, electromotive, force, at, a, given, point, in, space, is, equal, to, the, instantaneous, rate, of, change, with, respect, to, time, of, this, function, gauss, tried, to, find, a, unifying, law, for, long, distance, effects, of, electrostatics, electrodynamics, electromagnetism, and, induction, comparable, to, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, but, his, attempt, ended, in, a, tragic, failure, since, isaac, newton, had, shown, theoretically, that, the, earth, and, rotating, stars, assume, non, spherical, shapes, the, problem, of, attraction, of, ellipsoids, gained, importance, in, mathematical, astronomy, in, his, first, publication, on, potential, theory, the, theoria, attractionis, 1813, gauss, provided, a, closed, form, expression, to, the, gravitational, attraction, of, a, homogeneous, triaxial, ellipsoid, at, every, point, in, space, in, contrast, to, previous, research, of, maclaurin, laplace, and, lagrange, gauss, s, new, solution, treated, the, attraction, more, directly, in, the, form, of, an, elliptic, integral, in, the, process, he, also, proved, and, applied, some, special, cases, of, the, so, called, gauss, s, theorem, in, vector, analysis, in, the, general, theorems, concerning, the, attractive, and, repulsive, forces, acting, in, reciprocal, proportions, of, quadratic, distances, 1840, gauss, gave, the, baseline, of, a, theory, of, the, magnetic, potential, based, on, lagrange, laplace, and, poisson, it, seems, rather, unlikely, that, he, knew, the, previous, works, of, george, green, on, this, subject, however, gauss, could, never, give, any, reasons, for, magnetism, nor, a, theory, of, magnetism, similar, to, newton, s, work, on, gravitation, that, enabled, scientists, to, predict, geomagnetic, effects, in, the, future, gauss, s, calculations, enabled, instrument, maker, johann, georg, repsold, in, hamburg, to, construct, a, new, achromatic, lens, system, in, 1810, a, main, problem, among, other, difficulties, was, the, nonprecise, knowledge, of, the, refractive, index, and, dispersion, of, the, used, glass, types, in, a, short, article, from, 1817, gauss, dealt, with, the, problem, of, removal, of, chromatic, aberration, in, double, lenses, and, computed, adjustments, of, the, shape, and, coefficients, of, refraction, required, to, minimize, it, his, work, was, noted, by, the, optician, carl, august, von, steinheil, who, in, 1860, introduced, the, achromatic, steinheil, doublet, partly, based, on, gauss, s, calculations, many, results, in, geometrical, optics, are, only, scattered, in, gauss, s, correspondences, and, hand, notes, in, the, dioptrical, investigations, 1840, gauss, gave, the, first, systematic, analysis, on, the, formation, of, images, under, a, paraxial, approximation, gaussian, optics, he, characterized, optical, systems, under, a, paraxial, approximation, only, by, its, cardinal, points, and, he, derived, the, gaussian, lens, formula, applicable, without, restrictions, in, respect, to, the, thickness, of, the, lenses, gauss, s, first, business, in, mechanics, concerned, the, earth, s, rotation, when, his, university, friend, benzenberg, carried, out, experiments, to, determine, the, deviation, of, falling, masses, from, the, perpendicular, in, 1802, what, today, is, known, as, an, effect, of, the, coriolis, force, he, asked, gauss, for, a, theory, based, calculation, of, the, values, for, comparison, with, the, experimental, ones, gauss, elaborated, a, system, of, fundamental, equations, for, the, motion, and, the, results, corresponded, sufficiently, with, benzenberg, s, data, who, added, gauss, s, considerations, as, an, appendix, to, his, book, on, falling, experiments, after, foucault, had, demonstrated, the, earth, s, rotation, by, his, pendulum, experiment, in, public, in, 1851, gerling, questioned, gauss, for, further, explanations, this, instigated, gauss, to, design, a, new, apparatus, for, demonstration, with, a, much, shorter, length, of, pendulum, than, foucault, s, one, the, oscillations, were, observed, with, a, reading, telescope, with, a, vertical, scale, and, a, mirror, fastened, at, the, pendulum, it, is, described, in, the, gauss, gerling, correspondence, and, weber, made, some, experiments, with, this, apparatus, in, 1853, but, no, data, were, published, gauss, s, principle, of, least, constraint, of, 1829, was, established, as, a, general, concept, to, overcome, the, division, of, mechanics, into, statics, and, dynamics, combining, d, alembert, s, principle, with, lagrange, s, principle, of, virtual, work, and, showing, analogies, to, the, method, of, least, squares, in, 1828, gauss, was, appointed, to, head, of, a, board, for, weights, and, measures, of, the, kingdom, of, hanover, he, provided, the, creation, of, standards, of, length, and, measures, gauss, himself, took, care, of, the, time, consuming, measures, and, gave, detailed, orders, for, the, mechanical, preparation, in, the, correspondence, with, schumacher, who, was, also, working, on, this, matter, he, described, new, ideas, for, scales, of, high, precision, he, submitted, the, final, reports, on, the, hanoverian, foot, and, pound, to, the, government, in, 1841, this, work, got, more, than, regional, importance, by, the, order, of, a, law, of, 1836, that, connected, the, hanoverian, measures, with, the, english, ones, several, stories, of, his, early, genius, have, been, reported, carl, friedrich, gauss, s, mother, had, never, recorded, the, date, of, his, birth, remembering, only, that, he, had, been, born, on, a, wednesday, eight, days, before, the, feast, of, the, ascension, which, occurs, 39, days, after, easter, gauss, later, solved, this, puzzle, about, his, birthdate, in, the, context, of, finding, the, date, of, easter, deriving, methods, to, compute, the, date, in, both, past, and, future, years, in, his, memorial, on, gauss, wolfgang, sartorius, von, waltershausen, tells, a, story, about, the, three, year, old, gauss, who, corrected, a, math, error, his, father, made, the, most, popular, story, also, told, by, sartorius, tells, of, a, school, exercise, the, teacher, b, ttner, and, his, assistant, martin, bartels, ordered, students, to, add, an, arithmetic, series, out, of, about, a, hundred, pupils, gauss, was, the, first, to, solve, the, problem, correctly, by, a, significant, margin, although, or, because, sartorius, gave, no, details, over, time, many, versions, of, this, story, have, been, created, with, more, and, more, details, regarding, the, nature, of, the, series, the, most, frequent, being, the, classical, problem, of, adding, together, all, the, integers, from, 1, to, 100, and, the, circumstances, in, the, classroom, the, first, membership, of, a, scientific, society, was, given, to, gauss, in, 1802, by, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, further, memberships, corresponding, foreign, or, full, were, awarded, from, the, academy, of, sciences, in, g, ttingen, 1802, 1807, the,
