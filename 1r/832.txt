cultural, theory, and, remains, influential, in, turning, anthropology, toward, a, concern, with, the, frames, of, meaning, within, which, various, peoples, live, their, lives, he, reflected, on, the, basic, core, notions, of, anthropology, such, as, culture, and, ethnography, he, died, of, complications, following, heart, surgery, on, october, 30, 2006, at, the, time, of, his, death, geertz, was, working, on, the, general, question, of, ethnic, diversity, and, its, implications, in, the, modern, world, he, was, remembered, by, the, new, york, times, as, the, eminent, cultural, anthropologist, whose, work, focused, on, interpreting, the, symbols, he, believed, give, meaning, and, order, to, people, s, lives, geertz, s, often, cited, essay, deep, play, notes, on, the, balinese, cockfight, is, a, classic, example, of, thick, description, a, concept, adopted, from, the, british, philosopher, gilbert, ryle, which, comes, from, ordinary, language, philosophy, thick, description, is, an, anthropological, method, of, explaining, with, as, much, detail, as, possible, the, reason, behind, human, actions, many, human, actions, can, mean, many, different, things, and, geertz, insisted, that, the, anthropologist, needs, to, be, aware, of, this, the, work, proved, influential, amongst, historians, many, of, whom, tried, to, use, these, ideas, about, the, meaning, of, cultural, practice, in, the, study, of, customs, and, traditions, of, the, past, another, of, geertz, s, philosophical, influences, is, that, of, ludwig, wittgenstein, s, post, tractatus, philosophy, from, which, geertz, incorporates, the, concept, of, family, resemblances, into, anthropology, geertz, would, also, introduce, anthropology, to, the, umwelt, mitwelt, vorwelt, folgewelt, formulation, of, alfred, sch, tz, s, phenomenology, 367n, stressing, that, the, links, between, the, consociate, contemporary, predecessor, and, successor, that, are, commonplace, in, anthropology, derive, from, this, very, formulation, 68, at, the, university, of, chicago, geertz, became, a, champion, of, symbolic, anthropology, a, framework, which, gives, prime, attention, to, the, role, of, symbols, in, constructing, public, meaning, in, his, seminal, work, the, interpretation, of, cultures, 1973, geertz, outlined, culture, as, a, system, of, inherited, conceptions, expressed, in, symbolic, forms, by, means, of, which, men, communicate, perpetuate, and, develop, their, knowledge, about, and, attitudes, toward, life, 89, he, was, one, of, the, earliest, scholars, to, see, that, the, insights, provided, by, common, language, philosophy, and, literary, analysis, could, have, major, explanatory, force, in, the, social, sciences, geertz, aimed, to, provide, the, social, sciences, with, an, understanding, and, appreciation, of, thick, description, geertz, applied, thick, description, to, anthropological, studies, particularly, to, his, own, interpretive, anthropology, urging, anthropologists, to, consider, the, limitations, placed, upon, them, by, their, own, cultural, cosmologies, when, attempting, to, offer, insight, into, the, cultures, of, other, people, 5, he, produced, theory, that, had, implications, for, other, social, sciences, for, example, geertz, asserted, that, culture, was, essentially, semiotic, in, nature, and, this, theory, has, implications, for, comparative, political, sciences, max, weber, and, his, interpretative, social, science, are, strongly, present, in, geertz, s, work, drawing, from, weber, geertz, himself, argues, for, a, semiotic, concept, of, culture, believing, that, man, is, an, animal, suspended, in, webs, of, significance, he, himself, has, spun, i, take, culture, to, be, those, webs, and, the, analysis, of, it, to, be, therefore, not, an, experimental, science, in, search, of, law, but, an, interpretative, one, in, search, of, meaning, it, is, explication, i, am, after, construing, social, expression, on, their, surface, enigmatical, p, 5, geertz, argues, that, to, interpret, a, culture, s, web, of, symbols, scholars, must, first, isolate, its, elements, specifying, the, internal, relationships, among, those, elements, and, characterize, the, whole, system, in, some, general, way, according, to, the, core, symbols, around, which, it, is, organized, the, underlying, structures, of, which, it, is, a, surface, expression, or, the, ideological, principles, upon, which, it, is, based, it, was, his, view, that, culture, is, public, because, meaning, is, and, systems, of, meanings, are, what, produce, culture, because, they, are, the, collective, property, of, a, particular, people, we, cannot, discover, the, culture, s, import, or, understand, its, systems, of, meaning, when, as, wittgenstein, noted, we, cannot, find, our, feet, with, them, geertz, wants, society, to, appreciate, that, social, actions, are, larger, than, themselves, it, is, not, against, a, body, of, uninterrupted, data, radically, thinned, descriptions, that, we, must, measure, the, cogency, of, our, explications, but, against, the, power, of, the, scientific, imagination, to, bring, us, into, touch, with, the, lives, of, strangers, p, 18, in, seeking, to, converse, with, subjects, in, foreign, cultures, and, gain, access, to, their, conceptual, world, this, is, the, goal, of, the, semiotic, approach, to, culture, cultural, theory, is, not, its, own, master, at, the, end, of, the, day, we, must, appreciate, that, the, generality, thick, description, contrives, to, achieve, grows, out, of, the, delicacy, of, its, distinctions, not, the, sweep, of, its, abstraction, the, essential, task, of, theory, building, here, is, not, to, codify, abstract, regularities, but, to, make, thick, description, possible, not, to, generalize, across, cases, but, to, generalize, within, them, during, geertz, s, long, career, he, worked, through, a, variety, of, theoretical, phases, and, schools, of, thought, he, would, reflect, an, early, leaning, toward, functionalism, in, his, essay, ethos, worldview, and, the, analysis, of, sacred, symbols, writing, that, the, drive, to, make, sense, out, of, experience, to, give, it, form, and, order, is, evidently, as, real, and, pressing, as, the, more, familiar, biological, needs, 140, geertz, s, research, and, ideas, have, had, a, strong, influence, on, 20th, century, academia, including, modern, anthropology, and, communication, studies, as, well, as, for, geographers, ecologists, political, scientists, scholars, of, religion, historians, and, other, humanists, university, of, miami, professor, daniel, pals, 1996, wrote, of, geertz, that, his, critics, are, few, his, admirers, legion, talal, asad, attacked, the, dualism, in, geertzian, theory, the, theory, does, not, provide, a, bridge, between, external, symbols, and, internal, dispositions, asad, also, pointed, out, the, need, for, a, more, nuanced, approach, toward, the, historical, background, of, certain, concepts, criticizing, geertz, s, theory, of, religion, in, general, asad, pointed, out, a, gap, between, cultural, system, and, social, reality, when, attempting, to, define, the, concept, of, religion, in, universal, terms, he, would, also, criticize, geertz, for, ascribing, an, authorizing, discourse, around, conversations, of, comparative, religion, that, asad, argues, does, not, really, exist, furthermore, asad, criticized, geertz, for, operating, according, to, a, eurocentric, view, of, religion, that, places, import, on, signs, and, symbols, that, may, or, may, not, carry, through, in, non, christian, religious, cultures
