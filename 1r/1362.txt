threat, to, the, property, rights, of, american, enslavers, even, a, potential, source, of, insurrection, by, enslaved, people, jackson, ordered, colonel, duncan, clinch, to, capture, the, fort, in, july, 1816, he, destroyed, it, and, killed, many, of, the, garrison, some, survivors, were, enslaved, while, others, fled, into, the, wilderness, of, florida, white, american, settlers, were, in, constant, conflict, with, native, american, people, collectively, known, as, the, seminoles, who, straddled, the, border, between, the, u, s, and, florida, in, december, 1817, secretary, of, war, john, c, calhoun, initiated, the, first, seminole, war, by, ordering, jackson, to, lead, a, campaign, with, full, power, to, conduct, the, war, as, he, may, think, best, jackson, believed, the, best, way, to, do, this, was, to, seize, florida, from, spain, once, and, for, all, before, departing, jackson, wrote, to, president, james, monroe, let, it, be, signified, to, me, through, any, channel, that, the, possession, of, the, floridas, would, be, desirable, to, the, united, states, and, in, sixty, days, it, will, be, accomplished, jackson, invaded, florida, captured, the, spanish, fort, of, st, marks, and, occupied, pensacola, seminole, and, spanish, resistance, was, effectively, ended, by, may, 1818, he, also, captured, two, british, subjects, robert, ambrister, and, alexander, arbuthnot, who, had, been, working, with, the, seminoles, after, a, brief, trial, jackson, executed, both, of, them, causing, an, international, incident, with, the, british, jackson, s, actions, polarized, monroe, s, cabinet, the, occupied, territories, were, returned, to, spain, calhoun, wanted, him, censured, for, violating, the, constitution, since, the, united, states, had, not, declared, war, on, spain, secretary, of, state, john, quincy, adams, defended, him, as, he, thought, jackson, s, occupation, of, pensacola, would, lead, spain, to, sell, florida, which, spain, did, in, the, adams, on, s, treaty, of, 1819, in, february, 1819, a, congressional, investigation, exonerated, jackson, and, his, victory, was, instrumental, in, convincing, the, seminoles, to, sign, the, treaty, of, moultrie, creek, in, 1823, which, surrendered, much, of, their, land, in, florida, the, panic, of, 1819, the, united, states, first, prolonged, financial, depression, caused, congress, to, reduce, the, military, s, size, and, abolish, jackson, s, generalship, in, compensation, monroe, made, him, the, first, territorial, governor, of, florida, in, 1821, he, served, as, the, governor, for, two, months, returning, to, the, hermitage, in, ill, health, during, his, convalescence, jackson, who, had, been, a, freemason, since, at, least, 1798, became, the, grand, master, of, the, grand, lodge, of, tennessee, for, 1822, 1823, around, this, time, he, also, completed, negotiations, for, tennessee, to, purchase, chickasaw, lands, this, became, known, as, the, jackson, purchase, jackson, overton, and, another, colleague, had, speculated, in, some, of, the, land, and, used, their, portion, to, form, the, town, of, memphis, in, 1822, jackson, agreed, to, run, in, the, 1824, presidential, election, and, he, was, nominated, by, the, tennessee, legislature, in, july, at, the, time, the, federalist, party, had, collapsed, and, there, were, four, major, contenders, for, the, democratic, republican, party, nomination, william, crawford, john, quincy, adams, henry, clay, and, john, c, calhoun, jackson, was, intended, to, be, a, stalking, horse, candidate, to, prevent, tennessee, s, electoral, votes, from, going, to, crawford, who, was, seen, as, a, washington, insider, jackson, unexpectedly, garnered, popular, support, outside, of, tennessee, and, became, a, serious, candidate, he, benefited, from, the, expansion, of, suffrage, among, white, males, that, followed, the, conclusion, of, the, war, of, 1812, he, was, a, popular, war, hero, whose, reputation, suggested, he, had, the, decisiveness, and, independence, to, bring, reform, to, washington, he, also, was, promoted, as, an, outsider, who, stood, for, all, the, people, blaming, banks, for, the, country, s, depression, during, his, presidential, candidacy, jackson, reluctantly, ran, for, one, of, tennessee, s, u, s, senate, seats, jackson, s, political, managers, william, berkeley, lewis, and, john, eaton, convinced, him, that, he, needed, to, defeat, incumbent, john, williams, who, opposed, him, the, legislature, elected, jackson, in, october, 1823, he, was, attentive, to, his, senatorial, duties, he, was, appointed, chairman, of, the, committee, on, military, affairs, but, avoided, debate, or, initiating, legislation, he, used, his, time, in, the, senate, to, form, alliances, and, make, peace, with, old, adversaries, eaton, continued, to, campaign, for, jackson, s, presidency, updating, his, biography, and, writing, a, series, of, widely, circulated, pseudonymous, letters, that, portrayed, jackson, as, a, champion, of, republican, liberty, democratic, republican, presidential, nominees, had, historically, been, chosen, by, informal, congressional, nominating, caucuses, in, 1824, most, of, the, democratic, republicans, in, congress, boycotted, the, caucus, and, the, power, to, choose, nominees, was, shifting, to, state, nominating, committees, and, legislatures, jackson, was, nominated, by, a, pennsylvania, convention, making, him, not, merely, a, regional, candidate, but, the, leading, national, contender, when, jackson, won, the, pennsylvania, nomination, calhoun, dropped, out, of, the, presidential, race, afterwards, jackson, won, the, nomination, in, six, other, states, and, had, a, strong, second, place, finish, in, three, others, in, the, presidential, election, jackson, won, a, 42, percent, plurality, of, the, popular, vote, more, importantly, he, won, a, plurality, of, electoral, votes, receiving, 99, votes, from, states, in, the, south, west, and, mid, atlantic, he, was, the, only, candidate, to, win, states, outside, of, his, regional, base, adams, dominated, new, england, crawford, won, virginia, and, georgia, and, clay, took, three, western, states, because, no, candidate, had, a, majority, of, 131, electoral, votes, the, house, of, representatives, held, a, contingent, election, under, the, terms, of, the, twelfth, amendment, the, amendment, specifies, that, only, the, top, three, electoral, vote, winners, are, eligible, to, be, elected, by, the, house, so, clay, was, eliminated, from, contention, clay, who, was, also, speaker, of, the, house, and, presided, over, the, election, s, resolution, saw, a, jackson, presidency, as, a, disaster, for, the, country, clay, threw, his, support, behind, adams, who, won, the, contingent, election, on, the, first, ballot, adams, appointed, clay, as, his, secretary, of, state, leading, supporters, of, jackson, to, accuse, clay, and, adams, of, having, struck, a, corrupt, bargain, after, the, congressional, session, concluded, jackson, resigned, his, senate, seat, and, returned, to, tennessee, after, the, election, jackson, s, supporters, formed, a, new, party, to, undermine, adams, and, ensure, he, served, only, one, term, adams, s, presidency, went, poorly, and, adams, s, behavior, undermined, it, he, was, perceived, as, an, intellectual, elite, who, ignored, the, needs, of, the, populace, he, was, unable, to, accomplish, anything, because, congress, blocked, his, proposals, in, his, first, annual, message, to, congress, adams, stated, that, we, are, palsied, by, the, will, of, our, constituents, which, was, interpreted, as, his, being, against, representative, democracy, jackson, responded, by, championing, the, needs, of, ordinary, citizens, and, declaring, that, the, voice, of, the, people, must, be, heard, jackson, was, nominated, for, president, by, the, tennessee, legislature, in, october, 1825, more, than, three, years, before, the, 1828, election, he, gained, powerful, supporters, in, both, the, south, and, north, including, calhoun, who, became, jackson, s, vice, presidential, running, mate, and, new, york, senator, martin, van, buren, meanwhile, adams, s, support, from, the, southern, states, was, eroded, when, he, signed, a, tax, on, european, imports, the, tariff, of, 1828, which, was, called, the, tariff, of, abominations, by, opponents, into, law, jackson, s, victory, in, the, presidential, race, was, overwhelming, he, won, 56, percent, of, the, popular, vote, and, 68, percent, of, the, electoral, vote, the, election, ended, the, one, party, system, that, had, formed, during, the, era, of, good, feelings, as, jackson, s, supporters, coalesced, into, the, democratic, party, and, the, various, groups, who, did, not, support, him, eventually, formed, the, whig, party, the, political, campaign, was, dominated, by, the, personal, abuse, that, partisans, flung, at, both, candidates, jackson, was, accused, of, being, the, son, of, an, english, prostitute, and, a, mulatto, and, he, was, accurately, labeled, a, slave, trader, who, trafficked, in, human, flesh, a, series, of, pamphlets, known, as, the, coffin, handbills, accused, him, of, having, murdered, 18, white, men, including, the, soldiers, he, had, executed, for, desertion, and, alleging, that, he, stabbed, a, man, in, the, back, with, his, cane, they, stated, that, he, had, intentionally, massacred, native, american, women, and, children, at, the, battle, of, horseshoe, bend, ate, the, bodies, of, native, americans, he, killed, in, battle, and, threatened, to, cut, off, the, ears, of, congressmen, who, questioned, his, behavior, during, the, first, seminole, war, jackson, and, rachel, were, accused, of, adultery, for, living, together, before, her, divorce, was, finalized, and, rachel, heard, about, the, accusation, she, had, been, under, stress, throughout, the, election, and, just, as, jackson, was, preparing, to, head, to, washington, for, his, inauguration, she, fell, ill, she, did, not, live, to, see, her, husband, become, president, dying, of, a, stroke, or, heart, attack, a, few, days, later, jackson, believed, that, the, abuse, from, adams, supporters, had, hastened, her, death, stating, at, her, funeral, may, god, almighty, forgive, her, murderers, as, i, know, she, forgave, them, i, never, can, jackson, arrived, in, washington, d, c, on, february, 11, and, began, forming, his, cabinet, he, chose, van, buren, as, secretary, of, state, john, eaton, as, secretary, of, war, samuel, d, ingham, as, secretary, of, treasury, john, branch, as, secretary, of, navy, john, m, berrien, as, attorney, general, and, william, t, barry, as, postmaster, general, jackson, was, inaugurated, on, march, 4, 1829, adams, who, was, embittered, by, his, defeat, refused, to, attend, jackson, become, the, first, president, elect, to, take, the, oath, of, office, on, the, east, portico, of, the, u, s, capitol, in, his, inaugural, address, he, promised, to, protect, the, sovereignty, of, the, states, respect, the, limits, of, the, presidency, reform, the, government, by, removing, disloyal, or, incompetent, appointees, and, observe, a, fair, policy, toward, native, americans, jackson, invited, the, public, to, the, white, house, which, was, promptly, overrun, by, well, wishers, who, caused, minor, damage, to, its, furnishings, the, spectacle, earned, him, the, nickname, king, mob, jackson, believed, that, adams, s, administration, had, been, corrupt, and, he, initiated, investigations, into, all, executive, departments, these, investigations, revealed, that, 280, 000, equivalent, to, 8, 000, 000, in, 2023, was, stolen, from, the, treasury, they, also, resulted, in, a, reduction, in, costs, to, the, department, of, the, navy, saving, 1, million, equivalent, to, 28, 600, 000, in, 2023, jackson, asked, congress, to, tighten, laws, on, embezzlement, and, tax, evasion, and, he, pushed, for, an, improved, government, accounting, system, jackson, implemented, a, principle, he, called, rotation, in, office, the, previous, custom, had, been, for, the, president, to, leave, the, existing, appointees, in, office, replacing, them, through, attrition, jackson, enforced, the, tenure, of, office, act, an, 1820, law, that, limited, office, tenure, authorized, the, president, to, remove, current, office, holders, and, appoint, new, ones, during, his, first, year, in, office, he, removed, about, 10, of, all, federal, employees, and, replaced, them, with, loyal, democrats, jackson, argued, that, rotation, in, office, reduced, corruption, by, making, officeholders, responsible, to, the, popular, will, but, it, functioned, as, political, patronage, and, became, known, as, the, spoils, system, jackson, spent, much, of, his, time, during, his, first, two, and, a, half, years, in, office, dealing, with, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, petticoat, affair, or, eaton, affair, the, affair, focused, on, secretary, of, war, eaton, s, wife, margaret, she, had, a, reputation, for, being, promiscuous, and, like, rachel, jackson, she, was, accused, of, adultery, she, and, eaton, had, been, close, before, her, first, husband, john, timberlake, died, and, they, married, nine, months, after, his, death, with, the, exception, of, barry, s, wife, catherine, the, cabinet, members, wives, followed, the, lead, of, vice, president, calhoun, s, wife, floride, and, refused, to, socialize, with, the, eatons, though, jackson, defended, margaret, her, presence, split, the, cabinet, which, had, been, so, ineffective, that, he, rarely, called, it, into, session, and, the, ongoing, disagreement, led, to, its, dissolution, in, the, spring, of, 1831, jackson, demanded, the, resignations, of, all, the, cabinet, members, except, barry, who, would, resign, in, 1835, when, a, congressional, investigation, revealed, his, mismanagement, of, the, post, office, jackson, tried, to, compensate, van, buren, by, appointing, him, the, minister, to, great, britain, but, calhoun, blocked, the, nomination, with, a, tie, breaking, vote, against, it, van, buren, along, with, newspaper, editors, amos, kendall, and, francis, preston, blair, would, become, regular, participants, in, jackson, s, kitchen, cabinet, an, unofficial, varying, group, of, advisors, that, jackson, turned, to, for, decision, making, even, after, he, had, formed, a, new, official, cabinet, jackson, s, presidency, marked, the, beginning, of, a, national, policy, of, native, american, removal, before, jackson, took, office, the, relationship, between, the, southern, states, and, the, native, american, tribes, who, lived, within, their, boundaries, was, strained, the, states, felt, that, they, had, full, jurisdiction, over, their, territories, the, native, tribes, saw, themselves, as, autonomous, nations, that, had, a, right, to, the, land, they, lived, on, significant, portions, of, the, five, major, tribes, in, the, area, then, known, as, the, southwest, the, cherokee, choctaw, chickasaw, creek, and, seminoles, began, to, adopt, white, culture, including, education, agricultural, techniques, a, road, system, and, rudimentary, manufacturing, in, the, case, of, the, tensions, between, the, state, of, georgia, and, the, cherokee, adams, had, tried, to, address, the, issue, encouraging, cherokee, emigration, west, of, the, mississippi, through, financial, incentives, but, most, refused, in, the, first, days, of, jackson, s, presidency, some, southern, states, passed, legislation, extending, state, jurisdiction, to, native, american, lands, jackson, supported, the, states, right, to, do, so, his, position, was, later, made, clear, in, the, 1832, supreme, court, test, case, of, this, legislation, worcester, v, georgia, georgia, had, arrested, a, group, of, missionaries, for, entering, cherokee, territory, without, a, permit, the, cherokee, declared, these, arrests, illegal, the, court, under, chief, justice, john, marshall, decided, in, favor, of, the, cherokee, imposition, of, georgia, law, on, the, cherokee, was, unconstitutional, horace, greeley, alleges, that, when, jackson, heard, the, ruling, he, said, well, john, marshall, has, made, his, decision, but, now, let, him, enforce, it, although, the, quote, may, be, apocryphal, jackson, made, it, clear, he, would, not, use, the, federal, government, to, enforce, the, ruling, jackson, used, the, power, of, the, federal, government, to, enforce, the, separation, of, indigenous, tribes, and, whites, in, may, 1830, jackson, signed, the, indian, removal, act, which, congress, had, narrowly, passed, it, gave, the, president, the, right, to, negotiate, treaties, to, buy, tribal, lands, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, united, states, in, exchange, for, lands, set, aside, for, native, americans, west, of, the, mississippi, as, well, as, broad, discretion, on, how, to, use, the, federal, funds, allocated, to, the, negotiations, the, law, was, supposed, to, be, a, voluntary, relocation, program, but, it, was, not, implemented, as, one, jackson, s, administration, often, achieved, agreement, to, relocate, through, bribes, fraud, and, intimidation, and, the, leaders, who, signed, the, treaties, often, did, not, represent, the, entire, tribe, the, relocations, could, be, a, source, of, misery, too, the, choctaw, relocation, was, rife, with, corruption, theft, and, mismanagement, that, brought, great, suffering, to, that, people, in, 1830, jackson, personally, negotiated, with, the, chickasaw, who, quickly, agreed, to, move, in, the, same, year, choctaw, leaders, signed, the, treaty, of, dancing, rabbit, creek, the, majority, did, not, want, the, treaty, but, complied, with, its, terms, in, 1832, seminole, leaders, signed, the, treaty, of, payne, s, landing, which, stipulated, that, the, seminoles, would, move, west, and, become, part, of, the, muscogee, creek, confederacy, if, they, found, the, new, land, suitable, most, seminoles, refused, to, move, leading, to, the, second, seminole, war, in, 1835, that, lasted, six, years, members, of, the, muscogee, creek, confederacy, ceded, their, land, to, the, state, of, alabama, in, the, treaty, of, cusseta, of, 1832, their, private, ownership, of, the, land, was, to, be, protected, but, the, federal, government, did, not, enforce, this, the, government, did, encourage, voluntary, removal, until, the, creek, war, of, 1836, after, which, almost, all, creek, were, removed, to, oklahoma, territory, in, 1836, cherokee, leaders, ceded, their, land, to, the, government, by, the, treaty, of, new, echota, their, removal, known, as, the, trail, of, tears, was, enforced, by, jackson, s, successor, van, buren, jackson, also, applied, the, removal, policy, in, the, northwest, he, was, not, successful, in, removing, the, iroquois, confederacy, in, new, york, but, when, some, members, of, the, meskwaki, fox, and, the, sauk, triggered, the, black, hawk, war, by, trying, to, cross, back, to, the, east, side, of, the, mississippi, the, peace, treaties, ratified, after, their, defeat, reduced, their, lands, further, during, his, administration, he, made, about, 70, treaties, with, american, indian, tribes, he, had, removed, almost, all, the, native, americans, east, of, the, mississippi, and, south, of, lake, michigan, about, 70, 000, people, from, the, united, states, though, it, was, done, at, the, cost, of, thousands, of, native, american, lives, lost, because, of, the, unsanitary, conditions, and, epidemics, arising, from, their, dislocation, as, well, as, their, resistance, to, expulsion, jackson, s, implementation, of, the, indian, removal, act, contributed, to, his, popularity, with, his, constituency, he, added, over, 170, 000, square, miles, of, land, to, the, public, domain, which, primarily, benefited, the, united, states, agricultural, interests, the, act, also, benefited, small, farmers, as, jackson, allowed, them, to, purchase, moderate, plots, at, low, prices, and, offered, squatters, on, land, formerly, belonging, to, native, americans, the, option, to, purchase, it, before, it, was, offered, for, sale, to, others, jackson, had, to, confront, another, challenge, that, had, been, building, up, since, the, beginning, of, his, first, term, the, tariff, of, 1828, which, had, been, passed, in, the, last, year, of, adams, administration, set, a, protective, tariff, at, a, very, high, rate, to, prevent, the, manufacturing, industries, in, the, northern, states, from, having, to, compete, with, lower, priced, imports, from, britain, the, tariff, reduced, the, income, of, southern, cotton, planters, it, propped, up, consumer, prices, but, not, the, price, of, cotton, which, had, severely, declined, in, the, previous, decade, immediately, after, the, tariff, s, passage, the, south, carolina, exposition, and, protest, was, sent, to, the, u, s, senate, this, document, which, had, been, anonymously, written, by, john, c, calhoun, asserted, that, the, constitution, was, a, compact, of, individual, states, and, when, the, federal, government, went, beyond, its, delegated, duties, such, as, enacting, a, protective, tariff, a, state, had, a, right, to, declare, this, action, unconstitutional, and, make, the, act, null, and, void, within, the, borders, of, that, state, jackson, suspected, calhoun, of, writing, the, exposition, and, protest, and, opposed, his, interpretation, jackson, argued, that, congress, had, full, authority, to, enact, tariffs, and, that, a, dissenting, state, was, denying, the, will, of, the, majority, he, also, needed, the, tariff, which, generated, 90, of, the, federal, revenue, to, achieve, another, of, his, presidential, goals, eliminating, the, national, debt, the, issue, developed, into, a, personal, rivalry, between, the, two, men, for, example, during, a, celebration, of, thomas, jefferson, s, birthday, on, april, 13, 1830, the, attendees, gave, after, dinner, toasts, jackson, toasted, our, federal, union, it, must, be, preserved, a, clear, challenge, to, nullification, calhoun, whose, toast, immediately, followed, rebutted, the, union, next, to, our, liberty, the, most, dear, as, a, compromise, jackson, supported, the, tariff, of, 1832, which, reduced, the, duties, from, the, tariff, of, 1828, by, almost, half, the, bill, was, signed, on, july, 9, but, failed, to, satisfy, extremists, on, either, side, on, november, 24, south, carolina, had, passed, the, ordinance, of, nullification, declaring, both, tariffs, null, and, void, and, threatening, to, secede, from, the, united, states, if, the, federal, government, tried, to, use, force, to, collect, the, duties, in, response, jackson, sent, warships, to, charleston, harbor, and, threatened, to, hang, any, man, who, worked, to, support, nullification, or, secession, on, december, 10, he, issued, a, proclamation, against, the, nullifiers, condemning, nullification, as, contrary, to, the, constitution, s, letter, and, spirit, rejecting, the, right, of, secession, and, declaring, that, south, carolina, stood, on, the, brink, of, insurrection, and, treason, on, december, 28, calhoun, who, had, been, elected, to, the, u, s, senate, resigned, as, vice, president, jackson, asked, congress, to, pass, a, force, bill, authorizing, the, military, to, enforce, the, tariff, it, was, attacked, by, calhoun, as, despotism, meanwhile, calhoun, and, clay, began, to, work, on, a, new, compromise, tariff, jackson, saw, it, as, an, effective, way, to, end, the, confrontation, but, insisted, on, the, passage, of, the, force, bill, before, he, signed, on, march, 2, he, signed, into, law, the, force, bill, and, the, tariff, of, 1833, the, south, carolina, convention, then, met, and, rescinded, its, nullification, ordinance, but, nullified, the, force, bill, in, a, final, act, of, defiance, two, months, later, jackson, reflected, on, south, carolina, s, nullification, the, tariff, was, only, the, pretext, and, disunion, and, southern, confederacy, the, real, object, the, next, pretext, will, be, the, negro, or, slavery, question, a, few, weeks, after, his, inauguration, jackson, started, looking, into, how, he, could, replace, the, second, bank, of, the, united, states, the, bank, had, been, chartered, by, president, madison, in, 1816, to, restore, the, united, states, economy, after, the, war, of, 1812, monroe, had, appointed, nicholas, biddle, as, the, bank, s, executive, the, bank, was, a, repository, for, the, country, s, public, monies, which, also, serviced, the, national, debt, it, was, formed, as, a, for, profit, entity, that, looked, after, the, concerns, of, its, shareholders, in, 1828, the, country, was, prosperous, and, the, currency, was, stable, but, jackson, saw, the, bank, as, a, fourth, branch, of, government, run, by, an, elite, what, he, called, the, money, power, that, sought, to, control, the, labor, and, earnings, of, the, real, people, who, depend, on, their, own, efforts, to, succeed, the, planters, farmers, mechanics, and, laborers, additionally, jackson, s, own, near, bankruptcy, in, 1804, due, to, credit, fuelled, land, speculation, had, biased, him, against, paper, money, and, toward, a, policy, favorable, to, hard, money, in, his, first, annual, address, in, december, 1829, jackson, openly, challenged, the, bank, by, questioning, its, constitutionality, and, the, soundness, of, its, money, jackson, s, supporters, further, alleged, that, it, gave, preferential, loans, to, speculators, and, merchants, over, artisans, and, farmers, that, it, used, its, money, to, bribe, congressmen, and, the, press, and, that, it, had, ties, with, foreign, creditors, biddle, responded, to, jackson, s, challenge, in, early, 1830, by, using, the, bank, s, vast, financial, holding, to, ensure, the, bank, s, reputation, and, his, supporters, argued, that, the, bank, was, the, key, to, prosperity, and, stable, commerce, by, the, time, of, the, 1832, election, biddle, had, spent, over, 250, 000, equivalent, to, 7, 630, 000, in, 2023, in, printing, pamphlets, lobbying, for, pro, bank, legislation, hiring, agents, and, giving, loans, to, editors, and, congressmen, on, the, surface, jackson, s, and, biddle, s, positions, did, not, appear, irreconcilable, jackson, seemed, open, to, keeping, the, bank, if, it, could, include, some, degree, of, federal, oversight, limit, its, real, estate, holdings, and, have, its, property, subject, to, taxation, by, the, states, many, of, jackson, s, cabinet, members, thought, a, compromise, was, possible, in, 1831, treasury, secretary, louis, mclane, told, biddle, that, jackson, was, open, to, chartering, a, modified, version, of, the, bank, but, biddle, did, not, consult, jackson, directly, privately, jackson, expressed, opposition, to, the, bank, publicly, he, announced, that, he, would, leave, the, decision, concerning, the, bank, in, the, hands, of, the, people, biddle, was, finally, convinced, to, take, open, action, by, henry, clay, who, had, decided, to, run, for, president, against, jackson, in, the, 1832, election, biddle, would, agree, to, seek, renewal, of, the, charter, two, years, earlier, than, scheduled, clay, argued, that, jackson, was, in, a, bind, if, he, vetoed, the, charter, he, would, lose, the, votes, of, his, pro, bank, constituents, in, pennsylvania, but, if, he, signed, the, charter, he, would, lose, his, anti, bank, constituents, after, the, recharter, bill, was, passed, jackson, vetoed, it, on, july, 10, 1832, arguing, that, the, country, should, not, surrender, the, will, of, the, majority, to, the, desires, of, the, wealthy, the, 1832, presidential, election, demonstrated, the, rapid, development, of, political, parties, during, jackson, s, presidency, the, democratic, party, s, first, national, convention, held, in, baltimore, nominated, jackson, s, choice, for, vice, president, martin, van, buren, the, national, republican, party, which, had, held, its, first, convention, in, baltimore, earlier, in, december, 1831, nominated, clay, now, a, senator, from, kentucky, and, john, sergeant, of, pennsylvania, an, anti, masonic, party, with, a, platform, built, around, opposition, to, freemasonry, supported, neither, jackson, nor, clay, who, both, were, masons, the, party, nominated, william, wirt, of, maryland, and, amos, ellmaker, of, pennsylvania, in, addition, to, the, votes, jackson, would, lose, because, of, the, bank, veto, clay, hoped, that, jackson, s, indian, removal, act, would, alienate, voters, in, the, east, but, jackson, s, losses, were, offset, by, the, act, s, popularity, in, the, west, and, southwest, clay, had, also, expected, that, jackson, would, lose, votes, because, of, his, stand, on, internal, improvements, jackson, had, vetoed, the, maysville, road, bill, which, funded, an, upgrade, of, a, section, of, the, national, road, in, clay, s, state, of, kentucky, jackson, had, argued, it, was, unconstitutional, to, fund, internal, improvements, using, national, funds, for, local, projects, clay, s, strategy, failed, jackson, was, able, to, mobilize, the, democratic, party, s, strong, political, networks, the, northeast, supported, jackson, because, he, was, in, favor, of, maintaining, a, stiff, tariff, the, west, supported, him, because, the, indian, removal, act, reduced, the, number, of, native, americans, in, the, region, and, made, available, more, public, land, except, for, south, carolina, which, passed, the, ordinance, of, nullification, during, the, election, month, and, refused, to, support, any, party, by, giving, its, votes, to, the, future, governor, of, virginia, john, b, floyd, the, south, supported, jackson, for, implementing, the, indian, removal, act, as, well, as, for, his, willingness, to, compromise, by, signing, the, tariff, of, 1832, jackson, won, the, election, by, a, landslide, receiving, 55, percent, of, the, popular, vote, and, 219, electoral, votes, jackson, saw, his, victory, as, a, mandate, to, continue, his, war, on, the, bank, s, control, over, the, national, economy, in, 1833, jackson, signed, an, executive, order, ending, the, deposit, of, treasury, receipts, in, the, bank, when, secretary, of, the, treasury, mclane, refused, to, execute, the, order, jackson, replaced, him, with, william, j, duane, who, also, refused, jackson, then, appointed, roger, b, taney, as, acting, secretary, who, implemented, jackson, s, policy, with, the, loss, of, federal, deposits, the, bank, had, to, contract, its, credit, biddle, used, this, contraction, to, create, an, economic, downturn, in, an, attempt, to, get, jackson, to, compromise, biddle, wrote, nothing, but, the, evidence, of, suffering, abroad, will, produce, any, effect, in, congress, the, attempt, did, not, succeed, the, economy, recovered, and, biddle, was, blamed, for, the, recession, jackson, s, actions, led, those, who, disagreed, with, him, to, form, the, whig, party, they, claimed, to, oppose, jackson, s, expansion, of, executive, power, calling, him, king, andrew, the, first, and, naming, their, party, after, the, english, whigs, who, opposed, the, british, monarchy, in, the, 17th, century, in, march, 1834, the, senate, censured, jackson, for, inappropriately, taking, authority, for, the, treasury, department, when, it, was, the, responsibility, of, congress, and, refused, to, confirm, taney, s, appointment, as, secretary, of, the, treasury, in, april, however, the, house, declared, that, the, bank, should, not, be, rechartered, by, july, 1836, the, bank, no, longer, held, any, federal, deposits, jackson, had, federal, funds, deposited, into, state, banks, friendly, to, the, administration, s, policies, which, critics, called, pet, banks, the, number, of, these, state, banks, more, than, doubled, during, jackson, s, administration, and, investment, patterns, changed, the, bank, which, had, been, the, federal, government, s, fiscal, agent, invested, heavily, in, trade, and, financed, interregional, and, international, trade, state, banks, were, more, responsive, to, state, governments, and, invested, heavily, in, land, development, land, speculation, and, state, public, works, projects, in, spite, of, the, efforts, of, taney, s, successor, levi, woodbury, to, control, them, the, pet, banks, expanded, their, loans, helping, to, create, a, speculative, boom, in, the, final, years, of, jackson, s, administration, in, january, 1835, jackson, paid, off, the, national, debt, the, only, time, in, u, s, history, that, it, had, been, accomplished, it, was, paid, down, through, tariff, revenues, carefully, managing, federal, funding, of, internal, improvements, like, roads, and, canals, and, the, sale, of, public, lands, between, 1834, and, 1836, the, government, had, an, unprecedented, spike, in, land, sales, at, its, peak, in, 1836, the, profits, from, land, sales, were, eight, to, twelve, times, higher, than, a, typical, year, during, jackson, s, presidency, 63, million, acres, of, public, land, about, the, size, of, the, state, of, oklahoma, was, sold, after, jackson, s, term, expired, in, 1837, a, democrat, majority, senate, expunged, jackson, s, censure, despite, the, economic, boom, following, jackson, s, victory, in, the, bank, war, land, speculation, in, the, west, caused, the, panic, of, 1837, jackson, s, transfer, of, federal, monies, to, state, banks, in, 1833, caused, western, banks, to, relax, their, lending, standards, the, indian, removal, act, made, large, amounts, of, former, native, american, lands, available, for, purchase, and, speculation, two, of, jackson, s, acts, in, 1836, contributed, to, the, panic, of, 1837, one, was, the, specie, circular, which, mandated, western, lands, only, be, purchased, by, money, backed, by, specie, the, act, was, intended, to, stabilize, the, economy, by, reducing, speculation, on, credit, but, it, caused, a, drain, of, gold, and, silver, from, the, eastern, banks, to, the, western, banks, to, address, the, needs, of, financing, land, transactions, the, other, was, the, deposit, and, distribution, act, which, transferred, federal, monies, from, eastern, to, western, state, banks, together, they, left, eastern, banks, unable, to, pay, specie, to, the, british, when, they, recalled, their, loans, to, address, their, economic, problems, in, international, trade, the, panic, drove, the, u, s, economy, into, a, depression, that, lasted, until, 1841, jackson, was, the, first, president, to, be, subjected, to, both, a, physical, assault, and, an, assassination, attempt, on, may, 6, 1833, robert, b, randolph, struck, jackson, in, the, face, with, his, hand, because, jackson, had, ordered, randolph, s, dismissal, from, the, navy, for, embezzlement, jackson, declined, to, press, charges, while, jackson, was, leaving, the, united, states, capitol, on, january, 30, 1835, richard, lawrence, an, unemployed, house, painter, from, england, aimed, a, pistol, at, him, which, misfired, lawrence, pulled, out, a, second, pistol, which, also, misfired, jackson, attacked, lawrence, with, his, cane, until, others, intervened, to, restrain, lawrence, who, was, later, found, not, guilty, by, reason, of, insanity, and, institutionalized, during, jackson, s, presidency, slavery, remained, a, minor, political, issue, though, federal, troops, were, used, to, crush, nat, turner, s, slave, rebellion, in, 1831, jackson, ordered, them, withdrawn, immediately, afterwards, despite, the, petition, of, local, citizens, for, them, to, remain, for, protection, jackson, considered, the, issue, too, divisive, to, the, nation, and, to, the, delicate, alliances, of, the, democratic, party, jackson, s, view, was, challenged, when, the, american, anti, slavery, society, agitated, for, abolition, by, sending, anti, slavery, tracts, through, the, postal, system, into, the, south, in, 1835, jackson, condemned, these, agitators, as, monsters, who, should, atone, with, their, lives, because, they, were, attempting, to, destroy, the, union, by, encouraging, sectionalism, the, act, provoked, riots, in, charleston, and, pro, slavery, southerners, demanded, that, the, postal, service, ban, distribution, of, the, materials, to, address, the, issue, jackson, authorized, that, the, tracts, could, be, sent, only, to, subscribers, whose, names, could, be, made, publicly, accountable, that, december, jackson, called, on, congress, to, prohibit, the, circulation, through, the, south, of, incendiary, publications, intended, to, instigate, the, slaves, to, insurrection, the, jackson, administration, successfully, negotiated, a, trade, agreement, with, siam, the, first, east, asian, country, to, form, a, trade, agreement, with, the, u, s, the, administration, also, made, trade, agreements, with, great, britain, spain, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, in, his, first, annual, message, to, congress, jackson, addressed, the, issues, of, spoliation, claims, demands, of, compensation, for, the, capture, of, american, ships, and, sailors, by, foreign, nations, during, the, napoleonic, wars, using, a, combination, of, bluster, and, tact, he, successfully, settled, these, claims, with, denmark, portugal, and, spain, but, he, had, difficulty, collecting, spoliation, claims, from, france, which, was, unwilling, to, pay, an, indemnity, agreed, to, in, an, earlier, treaty, jackson, asked, congress, in, 1834, to, authorize, reprisals, against, french, property, if, the, country, failed, to, make, payment, as, well, as, to, arm, for, defense, in, response, france, put, its, caribbean, fleet, on, a, wartime, footing, both, sides, wanted, to, avoid, a, conflict, but, the, french, wanted, an, apology, for, jackson, s, belligerence, in, his, 1835, annual, message, to, the, congress, jackson, asserted, that, he, refused, to, apologize, but, stated, that, he, did, not, intend, to, menace, or, insult, the, government, of, france, the, french, were, assuaged, and, agreed, to, pay, 5, 000, 000, equivalent, to, 147, 677, 400, in, 2023, to, settle, the, claims, since, the, early, 1820s, large, numbers, of, americans, had, been, immigrating, into, texas, a, territory, of, the, newly, independent, nation, of, mexico, as, early, as, 1824, jackson, had, supported, acquiring, the, region, for, the, united, states, in, 1829, he, attempted, to, purchase, it, but, mexico, did, not, want, to, sell, by, 1830, there, were, twice, as, many, settlers, from, the, united, states, as, from, mexico, leading, to, tensions, with, the, mexican, government, that, started, the, texas, revolution, during, the, conflict, jackson, covertly, allowed, the, settlers, to, obtain, weapons, and, money, from, the, united, states, they, defeated, the, mexican, military, in, april, 1836, and, declared, the, region, an, independent, country, the, republic, of, texas, the, new, republic, asked, jackson, to, recognize, and, annex, it, although, jackson, wanted, to, do, so, he, was, hesitant, because, he, was, unsure, it, could, maintain, independence, from, mexico, he, also, was, concerned, because, texas, had, legalized, slavery, which, was, an, issue, that, could, divide, the, democrats, during, the, 1836, election, jackson, recognized, the, republic, of, texas, on, the, last, full, day, of, his, presidency, march, 3, 1837, jackson, appointed, six, justices, to, the, supreme, court, most, were, undistinguished, jackson, nominated, roger, b, taney, in, january, 1835, to, the, court, in, reward, for, his, services, but, the, nomination, failed, to, win, senate, approval, when, chief, justice, marshall, died, in, 1835, jackson, again, nominated, taney, for, chief, justice, he, was, confirmed, by, the, new, senate, serving, as, chief, justice, until, 1864, he, was, regarded, with, respect, during, his, career, on, the, bench, but, he, is, most, remembered, for, his, widely, condemned, decision, in, dred, scott, v, sandford, on, the, last, day, of, his, presidency, jackson, signed, the, judiciary, act, of, 1837, which, created, two, new, supreme, court, seats, and, reorganized, the, federal, circuit, courts, two, new, states, were, admitted, into, the, union, during, jackson, s, presidency, arkansas, june, 15, 1836, and, michigan, january, 26, 1837, both, states, increased, democratic, power, in, congress, and, helped, van, buren, win, the, presidency, in, 1836, as, new, states, tended, to, support, the, party, that, had, done, the, most, to, admit, them, jackson, s, presidency, ended, on, march, 4, 1837, jackson, left, washington, d, c, three, days, later, retiring, to, the, hermitage, in, nashville, where, he, remained, influential, in, national, and, state, politics, to, reduce, the, inflation, caused, by, the, panic, of, 1837, jackson, supported, an, independent, treasury, system, that, would, restrict, the, government, from, printing, paper, money, and, require, it, to, hold, its, money, in, silver, and, gold, during, the, 1840, presidential, election, jackson, campaigned, for, van, buren, in, tennessee, but, van, buren, had, become, unpopular, during, the, continuing, depression, the, whig, party, nominee, william, henry, harrison, won, the, election, using, a, campaign, style, similar, to, that, of, the, democrats, van, buren, was, depicted, as, an, uncaring, aristocrat, while, harrison, s, war, record, was, glorified, and, he, was, portrayed, as, a, man, of, the, people, harrison, won, the, 1840, election, and, the, whigs, captured, majorities, in, both, houses, of, congress, but, harrison, died, a, month, into, his, term, and, was, replaced, by, his, vice, president, former, democrat, john, tyler, jackson, was, encouraged, because, tyler, was, not, bound, to, party, loyalties, and, praised, him, when, he, vetoed, two, whig, sponsored, bills, to, establish, a, new, national, bank, in, 1841, jackson, lobbied, for, the, annexation, of, texas, he, was, concerned, that, the, british, could, use, it, as, a, base, to, threaten, the, united, states, and, insisted, that, it, was, part, of, the, louisiana, purchase, tyler, signed, a, treaty, of, annexation, in, april, 1844, but, it, became, associated, with, the, expansion, of, slavery, and, was, not, ratified, van, buren, who, had, been, jackson, s, preferred, candidate, for, the, democratic, party, in, the, 1844, presidential, election, had, opposed, annexation, disappointed, by, van, buren, jackson, convinced, fellow, tennessean, james, k, polk, who, was, then, set, to, be, van, buren, s, running, mate, to, run, as, the, democratic, party, s, presidential, nominee, instead, polk, defeated, van, buren, for, the, nomination, and, won, the, general, election, against, jackson, s, old, enemy, henry, clay, meanwhile, the, senate, passed, a, bill, to, annex, texas, and, it, was, signed, on, march, 1, 1845, jackson, died, of, dropsy, tuberculosis, and, heart, failure, at, 78, years, of, age, on, june, 8, 1845, he, was, surrounded, by, family, enslaved, persons, and, friends, at, his, deathbed, and, he, was, recorded, to, have, said, do, not, cry, i, hope, to, meet, you, all, in, heaven, yes, all, in, heaven, white, and, black, he, was, buried, in, the, same, tomb, as, his, wife, rachel, jackson, and, rachel, had, no, children, together, but, adopted, andrew, jackson, jr, the, son, of, rachel, s, deceased, brother, severn, donelson, the, jacksons, acted, as, guardians, for, donelson, s, other, children, john, samuel, daniel, smith, and, andrew, jackson, they, were, also, guardians, for, andrew, jackson, hutchings, rachel, s, orphaned, grand, nephew, and, the, orphaned, children, of, a, friend, edward, butler, caroline, eliza, edward, and, anthony, who, lived, with, the, jacksons, after, their, father, died, jackson, also, had, three, creek, children, living, with, them, lyncoya, a, creek, orphan, jackson, had, adopted, after, the, battle, of, tallushatchee, and, two, boys, they, called, theodore, and, charley, for, the, only, time, in, u, s, history, two, women, acted, simultaneously, as, unofficial, first, lady, for, the, widower, jackson, rachel, s, niece, emily, donelson, was, married, to, andrew, jackson, donelson, who, acted, as, jackson, s, private, secretary, and, served, as, hostess, at, the, white, house, the, president, and, emily, became, estranged, for, over, a, year, during, the, petticoat, affair, but, they, eventually, reconciled, and, she, resumed, her, duties, as, white, house, hostess, sarah, yorke, jackson, the, wife, of, andrew, jackson, jr, became, co, hostess, of, the, white, house, in, 1834, and, took, over, all, hostess, duties, after, emily, died, from, tuberculosis, in, 1836, jackson, had, a, reputation, for, being, short, tempered, and, violent, which, terrified, his, opponents, he, was, able, to, use, his, temper, strategically, to, accomplish, what, he, wanted, he, could, keep, it, in, check, when, necessary, his, behavior, was, friendly, and, urbane, when, he, went, to, washington, as, senator, during, the, campaign, leading, up, to, the, 1824, election, according, to, van, buren, he, remained, calm, in, times, of, difficulty, and, made, his, decisions, deliberatively, he, had, the, tendency, to, take, things, personally, if, someone, crossed, him, he, would, often, become, obsessed, with, crushing, them, for, example, on, the, last, day, of, his, presidency, jackson, declared, he, had, only, two, regrets, that, he, had, not, hanged, henry, clay, or, shot, john, c, calhoun, he, also, had, a, strong, sense, of, loyalty, he, considered, threats, to, his, friends, as, threats, to, himself, but, he, demanded, unquestioning, loyalty, in, return, jackson, was, self, confident, without, projecting, a, sense, of, self, importance, this, self, confidence, gave, him, the, ability, to, persevere, in, the, face, of, adversity, once, he, decided, on, a, plan, of, action, he, would, adhere, to, it, his, reputation, for, being, both, quick, tempered, and, confident, worked, to, his, advantage, it, misled, opponents, to, see, him, as, simple, and, direct, leading, them, to, often, understimate, his, political, shrewdness, in, 1838, jackson, became, an, official, member, of, the, first, presbyterian, church, in, nashville, both, his, mother, and, his, wife, had, been, devout, presbyterians, all, their, lives, but, jackson, stated, that, he, had, postponed, officially, entering, the, church, until, after, his, retirement, to, avoid, accusations, that, he, had, done, so, for, political, reasons, jackson, s, legacy, is, controversial, and, polarizing, his, contemporary, alexis, de, tocqueville, depicted, him, as, the, spokesperson, of, the, majority, and, their, passions, he, has, been, variously, described, as, a, frontiersman, personifying, the, independence, of, the, american, west, a, slave, owning, member, of, the, southern, gentry, and, a, populist, who, promoted, faith, in, the, wisdom, of, the, ordinary, citizen, he, has, been, represented, as, a, statesman, who, substantially, advanced, the, spirit, of, democracy, and, upheld, the, foundations, of, american, constitutionalism, as, well, as, an, autocratic, demagogue, who, crushed, political, opposition, and, trampled, the, law, in, the, 1920s, jackson, s, rise, to, power, became, associated, with, the, idea, of, the, common, man, this, idea, defined, the, age, as, a, populist, rejection, of, social, elites, and, a, vindication, of, every, person, s, value, independent, of, class, and, status, jackson, was, seen, as, its, personification, an, individual, free, of, societal, constraints, who, can, achieve, great, things, in, 1945, arthur, m, schlesinger, jr, s, influential, age, of, jackson, redefined, jackson, s, legacy, through, the, lens, of, franklin, d, roosevelt, s, new, deal, describing, the, common, man, as, a, member, of, the, working, class, struggling, against, exploitation, by, business, concerns, in, the, twenty, first, century, jackson, s, indian, removal, act, has, been, described, as, ethnic, cleansing, the, use, of, force, terror, and, violence, to, make, an, area, ethnically, homogeneous, to, achieve, the, goal, of, separating, native, americans, from, the, whites, coercive, force, such, as, threats, and, bribes, were, used, to, effect, removal, and, unauthorized, military, force, was, used, when, there, was, resistance, as, in, the, case, of, the, second, seminole, war, the, act, has, been, discussed, in, the, context, of, genocide, and, its, role, in, the, long, term, destruction, of, native, american, societies, and, their, cultures, continues, to, be, debated, jackson, s, legacy, has, been, variously, used, by, later, presidents, abraham, lincoln, referenced, jackson, s, ideas, when, negotiating, the, challenges, to, the, union, that, he, faced, during, 1861, including, jackson, s, understanding, of, the, constitution, during, the, nullification, crisis, and, the, president, s, right, to, interpret, the, constitution, franklin, d, roosevelt, used, jackson, to, redefine, the, democratic, party, describing, him, as, a, defender, of, the, exploited, and, downtrodden, and, as, a, fighter, for, social, justice, and, human, rights, the, members, of, the, progressive, party, of, 1948, to, 1955, saw, themselves, as, the, heirs, to, jackson, donald, trump, used, jackson, s, legacy, to, present, himself, as, the, president, of, the, common, man, praising, jackson, for, saving, the, country, from, a, rising, aristocracy, and, protecting, american, workers, with, a, tariff, in, 2016, president, barack, obama, s, administration, announced, it, was, removing, jackson, s, portrait, from, the, 20, bill, and, replacing, it, with, one, of, harriet, tubman, though, the, plan, was, put, on, hold, during, trump, s, presidency, president, joe, biden, s, administration, resumed, it, in, 2021, jackson, was, historically, rated, highly, as, a, president, but, his, reputation, began, to, decline, in, the, 1960s, his, contradictory, legacy, is, shown, in, opinion, polls, a, 2014, survey, of, political, scientists, rated, jackson, as, the, ninth, highest, rated, president, but, the, third, most, polarizing, he, was, also, ranked, the, third, most, overrated, president, in, a, c, span, poll, of, historians, jackson, was, ranked, the, 13th, in, 2009, 18th, in, 2017, and, 22nd, in, 2021
