june, 1948, were, french, manufacturers, of, photography, equipment, best, known, for, their, cin, matographe, motion, picture, system, and, the, short, films, they, produced, between, 1895, and, 1905, which, places, them, among, the, earliest, filmmakers, their, screening, of, a, single, film, on, 22, march, 1895, for, around, 200, members, of, the, soci, t, d, encouragement, pour, l, industrie, nationale, society, for, the, development, of, the, national, industry, in, paris, was, probably, the, first, presentation, of, projected, film, their, first, commercial, public, screening, on, 28, december, 1895, for, around, 40, paying, visitors, and, invited, relations, has, traditionally, been, regarded, as, the, birth, of, cinema, either, the, techniques, or, the, business, models, of, earlier, filmmakers, proved, to, be, less, viable, than, the, breakthrough, presentations, of, the, lumi, res, the, lumi, re, brothers, were, born, in, besan, on, france, to, charles, antoine, lumi, re, 1840, 1911, and, jeanne, jos, phine, costille, lumi, re, who, were, married, in, 1861, and, moved, to, besan, on, setting, up, a, small, photographic, portrait, studio, here, were, born, auguste, louis, and, their, daughter, jeanne, they, moved, to, lyon, in, 1870, where, their, two, other, daughters, were, born, m, lina, and, francine, auguste, and, louis, both, attended, la, martiniere, the, largest, technical, school, in, lyon, they, patented, several, significant, processes, leading, up, to, their, film, camera, most, notably, film, perforations, originally, implemented, by, mile, reynaud, as, a, means, of, advancing, the, film, through, the, camera, and, projector, the, original, cin, matographe, had, been, patented, by, l, on, guillaume, bouly, on, 12, february, 1892, the, cin, matographe, a, three, in, one, device, that, could, record, develop, and, project, motion, pictures, was, further, developed, by, the, lumi, res, the, brothers, patented, their, own, version, on, 13, february, 1895, the, date, of, the, recording, of, their, first, film, is, in, dispute, in, an, interview, with, georges, sadoul, given, in, 1948, louis, claimed, that, he, shot, the, film, in, august, 1894, before, the, arrival, of, the, kinetoscope, in, france, this, is, questioned, by, historians, who, consider, that, a, functional, lumi, re, camera, did, not, exist, before, the, beginning, of, 1895, the, lumi, re, brothers, saw, film, as, a, novelty, and, had, withdrawn, from, the, film, business, by, 1905, they, went, on, to, develop, the, first, practical, photographic, colour, process, the, lumi, re, autochrome, louis, died, on, 6, june, 1948, and, auguste, on, 10, april, 1954, they, are, buried, in, a, family, tomb, in, the, new, guilloti, re, cemetery, in, lyon, on, 22, march, 1895, in, paris, at, the, society, for, the, development, of, the, national, industry, in, front, of, a, small, audience, one, of, whom, was, said, to, be, l, on, gaumont, then, director, of, the, company, comptoir, g, neral, de, la, photographie, the, lumi, res, privately, screened, a, single, film, workers, leaving, the, lumi, re, factory, the, main, focus, of, the, conference, by, louis, concerned, the, recent, developments, in, the, photographic, industry, mainly, the, research, on, polychromy, colour, photography, it, was, much, to, lumi, re, s, surprise, that, the, moving, black, and, white, images, retained, more, attention, than, the, coloured, stills, the, lumi, res, gave, their, first, paid, public, screening, on, 28, december, 1895, at, salon, indien, du, grand, caf, in, paris, this, presentation, consisted, of, the, following, 10, short, films, each, film, was, up, to, 17, m, 56, ft, long, which, when, hand, cranked, through, a, projector, runs, approximately, 50, seconds, the, lumi, res, went, on, tour, with, the, cin, matographe, in, 1896, visiting, places, like, brussels, bombay, london, montreal, new, york, city, palestine, and, buenos, aires, in, 1896, only, a, few, months, after, the, initial, screenings, in, europe, films, by, the, lumiere, brothers, were, shown, in, egypt, first, in, the, tousson, stock, exchange, in, alexandria, on, 5, november, 1896, and, then, in, the, hamam, schneider, schneider, bath, in, cairo, the, brothers, stated, that, the, cinema, is, an, invention, without, any, future, and, declined, to, sell, their, camera, to, other, filmmakers, such, as, georges, m, li, s, this, made, many, film, makers, upset, consequently, their, role, in, the, history, of, film, was, exceedingly, brief, in, parallel, with, their, cinema, work, they, experimented, with, colour, photography, they, worked, on, colour, photographic, processes, in, the, 1890s, including, the, lippmann, process, interference, heliochromy, and, their, own, bichromated, glue, process, a, subtractive, colour, process, examples, of, which, were, exhibited, at, the, exposition, universelle, in, paris, in, 1900, this, last, process, was, commercialised, by, the, lumieres, but, commercial, success, had, to, wait, for, their, next, colour, process, in, 1903, they, patented, a, colour, photographic, process, the, autochrome, lumi, re, which, was, launched, on, the, market, in, 1907, throughout, much, of, the, 20th, century, the, lumi, re, company, was, a, major, producer, of, photographic, products, in, europe, but, the, brand, name, lumi, re, disappeared, from, the, marketplace, following, merger, with, ilford, earlier, moving, images, for, instance, those, of, the, phantasmagoria, shows, the, ph, nakisticope, the, zoetrope, and, mile, reynaud, s, th, tre, optique, consisted, of, hand, drawn, images, a, system, that, could, record, photographic, reality, in, motion, in, a, fashion, much, like, it, is, seen, by, the, eyes, had, a, greater, impact, on, people, eadweard, muybridge, s, zoopraxiscope, projected, moving, painted, silhouettes, based, on, his, chronophotographic, work, the, only, zoopraxiscope, disc, with, actual, photographs, was, made, as, an, early, form, of, stop, motion, less, known, predecessors, such, as, jules, duboscq, s, bioscope, patented, in, 1852, were, not, developed, to, project, the, moving, images, a, polish, inventor, kazimierz, pr, szy, ski, built, his, camera, and, projecting, device, called, pleograph, in, 1894, before, those, made, by, the, lumi, re, brothers, le, prince, went, missing, in, 1890, before, he, got, around, to, give, public, demonstrations, of, the, patented, cameras, and, projectors, he, had, been, developing, during, the, previous, years, his, short, film, known, as, roundhay, garden, scene, 1888, has, later, come, to, be, regarded, as, the, oldest, film, william, friese, greene, patented, a, machine, camera, in, 1889, which, embodied, many, aspects, of, later, film, cameras, he, displayed, the, results, at, photographic, societies, in, 1890, and, developed, further, cameras, but, did, not, publicly, project, the, results, ottomar, ansch, tz, s, electrotachyscope, projected, very, short, loops, of, high, photographic, quality, thomas, edison, believed, projection, of, films, wasn, t, as, viable, a, business, model, as, offering, the, films, in, the, peepshow, kinetoscope, device, watching, the, images, on, the, screen, turned, out, to, be, much, preferred, by, audiences, thomas, edison, s, kinetoscope, developed, by, william, kennedy, dickson, premiered, publicly, in, 1894, lauste, and, latham, s, eidoloscope, was, demonstrated, for, members, of, the, press, on, 21, april, 1895, and, opened, to, the, paying, public, on, broadway, on, 20, may, they, shot, films, up, to, twenty, minutes, long, at, speeds, over, thirty, frames, per, second, and, showed, them, in, many, us, cities, the, eidoloscope, company, was, dissolved, in, 1896, after, various, internal, disputes, max, and, emil, skladanowsky, inventors, of, the, bioscop, had, offered, projected, moving, images, to, a, paying, public, in, berlin, from, 1, november, 1895, until, the, end, of, the, month, their, machinery, was, relatively, cumbersome, and, their, films, much, shorter, than, those, of, the, lumi, re, brothers, the, skladnowskys, booked, screenings, in, paris, were, cancelled, after, the, news, of, the, lumi, re, show, nonetheless, they, toured, their, films, to, other, countries
