him, a, lot, he, was, running, a, matha, in, dehu, and, had, some, followers, initially, tukaram, gave, him, the, job, of, doing, puja, at, his, temple, but, he, was, jealous, of, tukaram, by, seeing, tukaram, getting, respect, among, the, village, people, he, once, hit, tukaram, by, thorn, s, stick, he, used, foul, language, against, tukaram, later, mambaji, also, became, admirer, of, tukaram, he, became, his, student, it, is, agreed, by, historians, that, saint, tukaram, died, in, 1650, in, his, work, of, abhangas, tukarama, repeatedly, refers, to, four, other, persons, who, had, a, primary, influence, on, his, spiritual, development, namely, the, earlier, bhakti, sants, namdev, dnyaneshwar, kabir, and, eknath, early, 20th, century, scholars, on, tukaram, considered, his, teachings, to, be, vedanta, based, but, lacking, a, systematic, theme, jf, edwards, wrote, tukaram, is, never, systematic, in, his, psychology, his, theology, or, his, theodicy, he, oscillates, between, a, dvaitist, and, an, advaitist, view, of, god, and, the, world, leaning, now, to, a, pantheistic, scheme, of, things, now, to, a, distinctly, providential, and, he, does, not, harmonize, them, he, says, little, about, cosmogony, and, according, to, him, god, realizes, himself, in, the, devotion, of, his, worshippers, likewise, faith, is, essential, to, their, realization, of, him, it, is, our, faith, that, makes, thee, a, god, he, says, boldly, to, his, vithoba, late, 20th, century, scholarship, of, tukaram, and, translations, of, his, abhanga, poem, affirm, his, pantheistic, vedantic, view, tukaram, s, abhanga, 2877, as, translated, by, shri, gurudev, ranade, of, nimbal, states, for, example, the, vedanta, has, said, that, the, whole, universe, is, filled, by, god, all, sciences, have, proclaimed, that, god, has, filled, the, whole, world, the, puranas, have, unmistakably, taught, the, universal, immanence, of, god, the, sants, have, told, us, that, the, world, is, filled, by, god, tuka, indeed, is, playing, in, the, world, uncontaminated, by, it, like, the, sun, which, stands, absolutely, transcendent, scholars, note, the, often, discussed, controversy, particularly, among, marathi, people, whether, tukaram, subscribed, to, the, monistic, vedanta, philosophy, of, adi, shankara, bhandarkar, notes, that, abhanga, 300, 1992, and, 2482, attributed, to, tukaram, are, in, style, and, philosophy, of, adi, shankara, when, salt, is, dissolved, in, water, what, is, it, that, remains, distinct, i, have, thus, become, one, in, joy, with, thee, and, have, lost, myself, in, thee, when, fire, and, camphor, are, brought, together, is, there, any, black, remnant, left, tuka, says, thou, and, i, are, one, light, however, scholars, also, note, that, other, abhangas, attributed, to, tukaram, criticize, monism, and, favor, dualistic, vedanta, philosophy, of, the, indian, philosophers, madhvacharya, and, ramanuja, in, abhanga, 1471, according, to, bhandarkar, s, translation, tukaram, says, when, monism, is, expounded, without, faith, and, love, the, expounder, as, well, as, the, hearer, are, troubled, and, afflicted, he, who, calls, himself, brahma, and, goes, on, in, his, usual, way, should, not, be, spoken, to, and, is, a, buffoon, the, shameless, one, who, speaks, heresy, in, opposition, to, the, vedas, is, an, object, of, scorn, among, holy, men, the, controversy, about, tukaram, s, true, philosophical, positions, has, been, complicated, by, questions, of, authenticity, of, poems, attributed, to, him, discovery, of, manuscripts, with, vastly, different, number, of, his, abhang, poems, and, that, tukaram, did, not, write, the, poems, himself, they, were, written, down, much, later, by, others, from, memory, tukaram, denounced, mechanical, rites, rituals, sacrifices, vows, and, instead, encouraged, direct, form, of, bhakti, devotion, tukaram, encouraged, kirtan, as, a, music, imbued, community, oriented, group, singing, and, dancing, form, of, bhakti, he, considered, kirtan, not, just, a, means, to, learn, about, bhakti, but, bhakti, itself, the, greatest, merit, in, kirtan, according, to, tukaram, is, it, being, not, only, a, spiritual, path, for, the, devotee, it, helps, create, a, spiritual, path, for, others, tukaram, accepted, disciples, and, devotees, without, discriminating, on, the, basis, of, gender, one, of, his, celebrated, devotees, was, bahina, bai, a, brahmin, woman, who, faced, anger, and, abuse, of, her, husband, when, she, chose, bhakti, marga, and, tukaram, as, her, guru, tukaram, taught, states, ranade, that, pride, of, caste, never, made, any, man, holy, the, vedas, and, shastras, have, said, that, for, the, service, of, god, castes, do, not, matter, castes, do, not, matter, it, is, god, s, name, that, matters, and, an, outcast, who, loves, the, name, of, god, is, verily, a, brahmin, in, him, have, tranquility, forbearance, compassion, and, courage, made, their, home, however, early, 20th, century, scholars, questioned, whether, tukaram, himself, observed, caste, when, his, daughters, from, his, second, wife, married, men, of, their, own, caste, fraser, and, edwards, in, their, 1921, review, of, tukaram, stated, that, this, is, not, necessarily, so, because, people, in, the, west, too, generally, prefer, relatives, to, marry, those, of, their, own, economic, and, social, strata, david, lorenzen, states, that, the, acceptance, efforts, and, reform, role, of, tukaram, in, the, varakari, sampraday, follows, the, diverse, caste, and, gender, distributions, found, in, bhakti, movements, across, india, tukaram, of, shudra, varna, was, one, of, the, nine, non, brahmins, of, the, twenty, one, considered, sant, in, varakari, sampraday, tradition, the, rest, include, ten, brahmins, and, two, whose, caste, origins, are, unknown, of, the, twenty, one, four, women, are, celebrated, as, sant, born, in, two, brahmin, and, two, non, brahmin, families, tukaram, s, effort, at, social, reforms, within, varakari, sampraday, must, be, viewed, in, this, historical, context, and, as, part, of, the, overall, movement, states, lorenzen, tukaram, composed, abhanga, poetry, a, marathi, genre, of, literature, which, is, metrical, traditionally, the, ovi, meter, simple, direct, and, it, fuses, folk, stories, with, deeper, spiritual, themes, tukaram, s, work, is, known, for, informal, verses, of, rapturous, abandon, in, folksy, style, composed, in, vernacular, language, in, contrast, to, his, predecessors, such, as, dnyandeva, or, namdev, known, for, combining, similar, depth, of, thought, with, a, grace, of, style, in, one, of, his, poems, tukaram, self, effacingly, described, himself, as, a, fool, confused, lost, liking, solitude, because, i, am, wearied, of, the, world, worshipping, vitthal, vishnu, just, like, my, ancestors, were, doing, but, i, lack, their, faith, and, devotion, and, there, is, nothing, holy, about, me, tukaram, gatha, is, a, marathi, language, compilation, of, his, works, likely, composed, between, 1632, and, 1650, also, called, abhanga, gatha, the, indian, tradition, believes, it, includes, some, 4, 500, abhangas, the, poems, considered, authentic, cover, a, wide, range, of, human, emotions, and, life, experiences, some, autobiographical, and, places, them, in, a, spiritual, context, he, includes, a, discussion, about, the, conflict, between, pravritti, having, passion, for, life, family, business, and, nivritti, the, desire, to, renounce, leave, everything, behind, for, individual, liberation,

the, pandharpur, ms, of, these, the, dehu, ms, is, most, referred, to, because, indian, tradition, asserts, that, it, is, based, on, the, writing, of, tukaram, s, son, mahadeva, but, there, is, no, historical, evidence, that, this, is, true, the, first, compilation, of, tukaram, poems, was, published, in, modern, format, by, indu, prakash, publishers, in, 1869, subsidized, by, the, british,

doctoring, and, rewriting, over, about, 200, years, after, tukaram, s, death, has, raised, questions, whether, the, modern, compilation, of, tukaram, s, poems, faithfully, represents, what, tukaram, actually, thought, and, said, and, the, historicity, of, the, document, the, known, manuscripts, are, jumbled, randomly, scattered, collections, without, chronological, sequence, and, each, contains,
