raffaello, sanzio, da, urbino, italian, march, 28, or, april, 6, 1483, april, 6, 1520, now, generally, known, in, english, as, raphael, uk, r, f, e, l, raf, ay, l, us, r, f, i, l, r, e, f, i, r, f, a, l, raf, ee, l, ray, fee, rah, fy, el, was, an, italian, painter, and, architect, of, the, high, renaissance, his, work, is, admired, for, its, clarity, of, form, ease, of, composition, and, visual, achievement, of, the, neoplatonic, ideal, of, human, grandeur, together, with, leonardo, da, vinci, and, michelangelo, he, forms, the, traditional, trinity, of, great, masters, of, that, period, his, father, was, court, painter, to, the, ruler, of, the, small, but, highly, cultured, city, of, urbino, he, died, when, raphael, was, eleven, and, raphael, seems, to, have, played, a, role, in, managing, the, family, workshop, from, this, point, he, trained, in, the, workshop, of, perugino, and, was, described, as, a, fully, trained, master, by, 1500, he, worked, in, or, for, several, cities, in, north, italy, until, in, 1508, he, moved, to, rome, at, the, invitation, of, pope, julius, ii, to, work, on, the, apostolic, palace, at, the, vatican, he, was, given, a, series, of, important, commissions, there, and, elsewhere, in, the, city, and, began, to, work, as, an, architect, he, was, still, at, the, height, of, his, powers, at, his, death, in, 1520, raphael, was, enormously, productive, running, an, unusually, large, workshop, and, despite, his, early, death, at, 37, leaving, a, large, body, of, work, his, career, falls, naturally, into, three, phases, and, three, styles, first, described, by, giorgio, vasari, his, early, years, in, umbria, then, a, period, of, about, four, years, 1504, 1508, absorbing, the, artistic, traditions, of, florence, followed, by, his, last, hectic, and, triumphant, twelve, years, in, rome, working, for, two, popes, and, their, close, associates, many, of, his, works, are, found, in, the, vatican, palace, where, the, frescoed, raphael, rooms, were, the, central, and, the, largest, work, of, his, career, the, best, known, work, is, the, school, of, athens, in, the, vatican, stanza, della, segnatura, after, his, early, years, in, rome, much, of, his, work, was, executed, by, his, workshop, from, his, drawings, with, considerable, loss, of, quality, he, was, extremely, influential, in, his, lifetime, though, outside, rome, his, work, was, mostly, known, from, his, collaborative, printmaking, after, his, death, the, influence, of, his, great, rival, michelangelo, exceeded, his, until, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, when, raphael, s, more, serene, and, harmonious, qualities, were, again, regarded, as, the, highest, models, thanks, to, the, influence, of, art, historian, johann, joachim, winckelmann, his, work, became, a, formative, influence, on, neoclassical, painting, but, his, techniques, would, later, be, explicitly, and, emphatically, rejected, by, groups, such, as, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, raphael, was, born, in, the, small, but, artistically, significant, central, italian, city, of, urbino, in, the, marches, region, where, his, father, giovanni, santi, was, court, painter, to, the, duke, the, reputation, of, the, court, had, been, established, by, federico, da, montefeltro, a, highly, successful, condottiere, who, had, been, created, duke, of, urbino, by, pope, sixtus, iv, urbino, formed, part, of, the, papal, states, and, who, died, the, year, before, raphael, was, born, the, emphasis, of, federico, s, court, was, more, literary, than, artistic, but, giovanni, santi, was, a, poet, of, sorts, as, well, as, a, painter, and, had, written, a, rhymed, chronicle, of, the, life, of, federico, and, both, wrote, the, texts, and, produced, the, decor, for, masque, like, court, entertainments, his, poem, to, federico, shows, him, as, keen, to, demonstrate, awareness, of, the, most, advanced, north, italian, painters, and, early, netherlandish, artists, as, well, in, the, very, small, court, of, urbino, he, was, probably, more, integrated, into, the, central, circle, of, the, ruling, family, than, most, court, painters, federico, was, succeeded, by, his, son, guidobaldo, da, montefeltro, who, married, elisabetta, gonzaga, daughter, of, the, ruler, of, mantua, the, most, brilliant, of, the, smaller, italian, courts, for, both, music, and, the, visual, arts, under, them, the, court, continued, as, a, centre, for, literary, culture, growing, up, in, the, circle, of, this, small, court, gave, raphael, the, excellent, manners, and, social, skills, stressed, by, vasari, court, life, in, urbino, at, just, after, this, period, was, to, become, set, as, the, model, of, the, virtues, of, the, italian, humanist, court, through, baldassare, castiglione, s, depiction, of, it, in, his, classic, work, the, book, of, the, courtier, published, in, 1528, castiglione, moved, to, urbino, in, 1504, when, raphael, was, no, longer, based, there, but, frequently, visited, and, they, became, good, friends, raphael, became, close, to, other, regular, visitors, to, the, court, pietro, bibbiena, and, pietro, bembo, both, later, cardinals, were, already, becoming, well, known, as, writers, and, would, later, be, in, rome, during, raphael, s, period, there, raphael, mixed, easily, in, the, highest, circles, throughout, his, life, one, of, the, factors, that, tended, to, give, a, misleading, impression, of, effortlessness, to, his, career, he, did, not, receive, a, full, humanistic, education, however, it, is, unclear, how, easily, he, read, latin, raphael, s, mother, m, gia, died, in, 1491, when, he, was, eight, followed, on, august, 1, 1494, by, his, father, who, had, already, remarried, raphael, was, thus, orphaned, at, eleven, his, formal, guardian, became, his, only, paternal, uncle, bartolomeo, a, priest, who, subsequently, engaged, in, litigation, with, his, stepmother, the, boy, probably, continued, to, live, with, his, stepmother, when, not, staying, as, an, apprentice, with, a, master, he, had, already, shown, talent, according, to, vasari, who, says, that, raphael, had, been, a, great, help, to, his, father, a, self, portrait, drawing, from, his, teenage, years, shows, his, precocity, his, father, s, workshop, continued, and, probably, together, with, his, stepmother, raphael, evidently, played, a, part, in, managing, it, from, a, very, early, age, in, urbino, he, came, into, contact, with, the, works, of, paolo, uccello, previously, the, court, painter, d, 1475, and, luca, signorelli, who, until, 1498, was, based, in, nearby, citt, di, castello, according, to, vasari, raphael, s, father, placed, him, in, the, workshop, of, the, umbrian, master, pietro, perugino, as, an, apprentice, despite, the, tears, of, his, mother, the, evidence, of, an, apprenticeship, comes, only, from, vasari, and, another, source, and, has, been, disputed, eight, was, very, early, for, an, apprenticeship, to, begin, an, alternative, theory, is, that, the, boy, received, at, least, some, training, from, timoteo, viti, who, acted, as, court, painter, in, urbino, from, 1495, most, modern, historians, agree, that, raphael, at, least, worked, as, an, assistant, to, perugino, from, around, 1500, the, influence, of, perugino, on, raphael, s, early, work, is, very, clear, probably, no, other, pupil, of, genius, has, ever, absorbed, so, much, of, his, master, s, teaching, as, raphael, did, according, to, w, lfflin, vasari, wrote, that, it, was, impossible, to, distinguish, between, their, hands, at, this, period, but, many, modern, art, historians, claim, to, do, better, and, detect, his, hand, in, specific, areas, of, works, by, perugino, or, his, workshop, apart, from, stylistic, closeness, their, techniques, are, very, similar, as, well, for, example, having, paint, applied, thickly, using, an, oil, varnish, medium, in, shadows, and, darker, garments, but, very, thinly, on, flesh, areas, an, excess, of, resin, in, the, varnish, often, causes, cracking, of, areas, of, paint, in, the, works, of, both, masters, the, perugino, workshop, was, active, in, both, perugia, and, florence, perhaps, maintaining, two, permanent, branches, raphael, is, described, as, a, master, that, is, to, say, fully, trained, in, december, 1500, his, first, documented, work, was, the, baronci, altarpiece, for, the, church, of, saint, nicholas, of, tolentino, in, citt, di, castello, a, town, halfway, between, perugia, and, urbino, evangelista, da, pian, di, meleto, who, had, worked, for, his, father, was, also, named, in, the, commission, it, was, commissioned, in, 1500, and, finished, in, 1501, now, only, some, cut, sections, and, a, preparatory, drawing, remain, in, the, following, years, he, painted, works, for, other, churches, there, including, the, mond, crucifixion, about, 1503, and, the, brera, wedding, of, the, virgin, 1504, and, for, perugia, such, as, the, oddi, altarpiece, he, very, probably, also, visited, florence, in, this, period, these, are, large, works, some, in, fresco, where, raphael, confidently, marshals, his, compositions, in, the, somewhat, static, style, of, perugino, he, also, painted, many, small, and, exquisite, cabinet, paintings, in, these, years, probably, mostly, for, the, connoisseurs, in, the, urbino, court, like, the, three, graces, and, st, michael, and, he, began, to, paint, madonnas, and, portraits, in, 1502, he, went, to, siena, at, the, invitation, of, another, pupil, of, perugino, pinturicchio, being, a, friend, of, raphael, and, knowing, him, to, be, a, draughtsman, of, the, highest, quality, to, help, with, the, cartoons, and, very, likely, the, designs, for, a, fresco, series, in, the, piccolomini, library, in, siena, cathedral, he, was, evidently, already, much, in, demand, even, at, this, early, stage, in, his, career, raphael, led, a, nomadic, life, working, in, various, centres, in, northern, italy, but, spent, a, good, deal, of, time, in, florence, perhaps, from, about, 1504, although, there, is, traditional, reference, to, a, florentine, period, of, about, 1504, 1508, he, was, possibly, never, a, continuous, resident, there, he, may, have, needed, to, visit, the, city, to, secure, materials, in, any, case, there, is, a, letter, of, recommendation, of, raphael, dated, october, 1504, from, the, mother, of, the, next, duke, of, urbino, to, the, gonfaloniere, of, florence, the, bearer, of, this, will, be, found, to, be, raphael, painter, of, urbino, who, being, greatly, gifted, in, his, profession, has, determined, to, spend, some, time, in, florence, to, study, and, because, his, father, was, most, worthy, and, i, was, very, attached, to, him, and, the, son, is, a, sensible, and, well, mannered, young, man, on, both, accounts, i, bear, him, great, love, as, earlier, with, perugino, and, others, raphael, was, able, to, assimilate, the, influence, of, florentine, art, whilst, keeping, his, own, developing, style, frescos, in, perugia, of, about, 1505, show, a, new, monumental, quality, in, the, figures, which, may, represent, the, influence, of, fra, bartolomeo, who, vasari, says, was, a, friend, of, raphael, but, the, most, striking, influence, in, the, work, of, these, years, is, leonardo, da, vinci, who, returned, to, the, city, from, 1500, to, 1506, raphael, s, figures, begin, to, take, more, dynamic, and, complex, positions, and, though, as, yet, his, painted, subjects, are, still, mostly, tranquil, he, made, drawn, studies, of, fighting, nude, men, one, of, the, obsessions, of, the, period, in, florence, another, drawing, is, a, portrait, of, a, young, woman, that, uses, the, three, quarter, length, pyramidal, composition, of, the, just, completed, mona, lisa, but, still, looks, completely, raphaelesque, another, of, leonardo, s, compositional, inventions, the, pyramidal, holy, family, was, repeated, in, a, series, of, works, that, remain, among, his, most, famous, easel, paintings, there, is, a, drawing, by, raphael, in, the, royal, collection, of, leonardo, s, lost, leda, and, the, swan, from, which, he, adapted, the, contrapposto, pose, of, his, own, saint, catherine, of, alexandria, he, also, perfects, his, own, version, of, leonardo, s, sfumato, modelling, to, give, subtlety, to, his, painting, of, flesh, and, develops, the, interplay, of, glances, between, his, groups, which, are, much, less, enigmatic, than, those, of, leonardo, but, he, keeps, the, soft, clear, light, of, perugino, in, his, paintings, leonardo, was, more, than, thirty, years, older, than, raphael, but, michelangelo, who, was, in, rome, for, this, period, was, just, eight, years, his, senior, michelangelo, already, disliked, leonardo, and, in, rome, came, to, dislike, raphael, even, more, attributing, conspiracies, against, him, to, the, younger, man, raphael, would, have, been, aware, of, his, works, in, florence, but, in, his, most, original, work, of, these, years, he, strikes, out, in, a, different, direction, his, deposition, of, christ, draws, on, classical, sarcophagi, to, spread, the, figures, across, the, front, of, the, picture, space, in, a, complex, and, not, wholly, successful, arrangement, w, llflin, detects, in, the, kneeling, figure, on, the, right, the, influence, of, the, madonna, in, michelangelo, s, doni, tondo, but, the, rest, of, the, composition, is, far, removed, from, his, style, or, that, of, leonardo, though, highly, regarded, at, the, time, and, much, later, forcibly, removed, from, perugia, by, the, borghese, it, stands, rather, alone, in, raphael, s, work, his, classicism, would, later, take, a, less, literal, direction, in, 1508, raphael, moved, to, rome, where, he, resided, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, was, invited, by, the, new, pope, julius, ii, perhaps, at, the, suggestion, of, his, architect, donato, bramante, then, engaged, on, st, peter, s, basilica, who, came, from, just, outside, urbino, and, was, distantly, related, to, raphael, unlike, michelangelo, who, had, been, kept, lingering, in, rome, for, several, months, after, his, first, summons, raphael, was, immediately, commissioned, by, julius, to, fresco, what, was, intended, to, become, the, pope, s, private, library, at, the, vatican, palace, this, was, a, much, larger, and, more, important, commission, than, any, he, had, received, before, he, had, only, painted, one, altarpiece, in, florence, itself, several, other, artists, and, their, teams, of, assistants, were, already, at, work, on, different, rooms, many, painting, over, recently, completed, paintings, commissioned, by, julius, s, loathed, predecessor, alexander, vi, whose, contributions, and, arms, julius, was, determined, to, efface, from, the, palace, michelangelo, meanwhile, had, been, commissioned, to, paint, the, sistine, chapel, ceiling, this, first, of, the, famous, stanze, or, raphael, rooms, to, be, painted, now, known, as, the, stanza, della, segnatura, after, its, use, in, vasari, s, time, was, to, make, a, stunning, impact, on, roman, art, and, remains, generally, regarded, as, his, greatest, masterpiece, containing, the, school, of, athens, the, parnassus, and, the, disputa, raphael, was, then, given, further, rooms, to, paint, displacing, other, artists, including, perugino, and, signorelli, he, completed, a, sequence, of, three, rooms, each, with, paintings, on, each, wall, and, often, the, ceilings, too, increasingly, leaving, the, work, of, painting, from, his, detailed, drawings, to, the, large, and, skilled, workshop, team, he, had, acquired, who, added, a, fourth, room, probably, only, including, some, elements, designed, by, raphael, after, his, early, death, in, 1520, the, death, of, julius, in, 1513, did, not, interrupt, the, work, at, all, as, he, was, succeeded, by, raphael, s, last, pope, the, medici, pope, leo, x, with, whom, raphael, formed, an, even, closer, relationship, and, who, continued, to, commission, him, raphael, s, friend, cardinal, bibbiena, was, also, one, of, leo, s, old, tutors, and, a, close, friend, and, advisor, in, the, course, of, painting, the, room, raphael, was, clearly, influenced, by, michelangelo, s, sistine, chapel, ceiling, vasari, said, bramante, let, him, into, the, chapel, secretly, raphael, completed, the, first, section, of, his, work, in, 1511, and, the, reaction, of, other, artists, to, the, daunting, force, of, michelangelo, was, the, dominating, question, in, italian, art, for, the, following, few, decades, raphael, who, had, already, shown, his, gift, for, absorbing, influences, into, his, own, personal, style, rose, to, the, challenge, perhaps, better, than, any, other, artist, one, of, the, first, and, clearest, instances, was, the, portrait, in, the, school, of, athens, of, michelangelo, himself, as, heraclitus, which, seems, to, draw, clearly, from, the, sybils, and, ignudi, of, the, sistine, ceiling, other, figures, in, that, and, later, paintings, in, the, room, show, the, same, influences, but, as, still, cohesive, with, a, development, of, raphael, s, own, style, michelangelo, accused, raphael, of, plagiarism, and, years, after, raphael, s, death, complained, in, a, letter, that, everything, he, knew, about, art, he, got, from, me, although, other, quotations, show, more, generous, reactions, these, very, large, and, complex, compositions, have, been, regarded, ever, since, as, among, the, supreme, works, of, the, grand, manner, of, the, high, renaissance, and, the, classic, art, of, the, post, antique, west, they, give, a, highly, idealised, depiction, of, the, forms, represented, and, the, compositions, though, very, carefully, conceived, in, drawings, achieve, sprezzatura, a, term, invented, by, his, friend, castiglione, who, defined, it, as, a, certain, nonchalance, which, conceals, all, artistry, and, makes, whatever, one, says, or, does, seem, uncontrived, and, effortless, according, to, michael, levey, raphael, gives, his, a, superhuman, clarity, and, grace, in, a, universe, of, euclidian, certainties, the, painting, is, nearly, all, of, the, highest, quality, in, the, first, two, rooms, but, the, later, compositions, in, the, stanze, especially, those, involving, dramatic, action, are, not, entirely, as, successful, either, in, conception, or, their, execution, by, the, workshop, after, bramante, s, death, in, 1514, raphael, was, named, architect, of, the, new, st, peter, s, most, of, his, work, there, was, altered, or, demolished, after, his, death, and, the, acceptance, of, michelangelo, s, design, but, a, few, drawings, have, survived, it, appears, his, designs, would, have, made, the, church, a, good, deal, gloomier, than, the, final, design, with, massive, piers, all, the, way, down, the, nave, like, an, alley, according, to, a, critical, posthumous, analysis, by, antonio, da, sangallo, the, younger, it, would, perhaps, have, resembled, the, temple, in, the, background, of, the, expulsion, of, heliodorus, from, the, temple, he, designed, several, other, buildings, and, for, a, short, time, was, the, most, important, architect, in, rome, working, for, a, small, circle, around, the, papacy, julius, had, made, changes, to, the, street, plan, of, rome, creating, several, new, thoroughfares, and, he, wanted, them, filled, with, splendid, palaces, an, important, building, the, palazzo, branconio, dell, aquila, for, leo, s, papal, chamberlain, giovanni, battista, branconio, was, completely, destroyed, to, make, way, for, bernini, s, piazza, for, st, peter, s, but, drawings, of, the, fa, ade, and, courtyard, remain, the, fa, ade, was, an, unusually, richly, decorated, one, for, the, period, including, both, painted, panels, on, the, top, story, of, three, and, much, sculpture, on, the, middle, one, the, main, designs, for, the, villa, farnesina, were, not, by, raphael, but, he, did, design, and, decorate, with, mosaics, the, chigi, chapel, for, the, same, patron, agostino, chigi, the, papal, treasurer, another, building, for, pope, leo, s, doctor, the, palazzo, jacopo, da, brescia, was, moved, in, the, 1930s, but, survives, this, was, designed, to, complement, a, palace, on, the, same, street, by, bramante, where, raphael, himself, lived, for, a, time, the, villa, madama, a, lavish, hillside, retreat, for, cardinal, giulio, de, medici, later, pope, clement, vii, was, never, finished, and, his, full, plans, have, to, be, reconstructed, speculatively, he, produced, a, design, from, which, the, final, construction, plans, were, completed, by, antonio, da, sangallo, the, younger, even, incomplete, it, was, the, most, sophisticated, villa, design, yet, seen, in, italy, and, greatly, influenced, the, later, development, of, the, genre, it, appears, to, be, the, only, modern, building, in, rome, of, which, palladio, made, a, measured, drawing, only, some, floor, plans, remain, for, a, large, palace, planned, for, himself, on, the, new, via, giulia, in, the, rione, of, regola, for, which, he, was, accumulating, the, land, in, his, last, years, it, was, on, an, irregular, island, block, near, the, river, tiber, it, seems, all, fa, ades, were, to, have, a, giant, order, of, pilasters, rising, at, least, two, storeys, to, the, full, height, of, the, piano, nobile, a, grandiloquent, feature, unprecedented, in, private, palace, design, raphael, asked, marco, fabio, calvo, to, translate, vitruvius, s, four, books, of, architecture, into, italian, this, he, received, around, the, end, of, august, 1514, it, is, preserved, at, the, library, in, munich, with, handwritten, margin, notes, by, raphael, in, about, 1510, raphael, was, asked, by, bramante, to, judge, contemporary, copies, of, laoco, n, and, his, sons, in, 1515, he, was, given, powers, as, prefect, over, all, antiquities, unearthed, within, or, a, mile, outside, the, city, anyone, excavating, antiquities, was, required, to, inform, raphael, within, three, days, and, stonemasons, were, not, allowed, to, destroy, inscriptions, without, permission, raphael, wrote, a, letter, to, pope, leo, suggesting, ways, of, halting, the, destruction, of, ancient, monuments, and, proposed, a, visual, survey, of, the, city, to, record, all, antiquities, in, an, organised, fashion, the, pope, intended, to, continue, to, re, use, ancient, masonry, in, the, building, of, st, peter, s, also, wanting, to, ensure, that, all, ancient, inscriptions, were, recorded, and, sculpture, preserved, before, allowing, the, stones, to, be, reused, according, to, marino, sanuto, the, younger, s, diary, in, 1519, raphael, offered, to, transport, an, obelisk, from, the, mausoleum, of, august, to, st, peter, s, square, for, 90, 000, ducats, according, to, marcantonio, michiel, raphael, s, youthful, death, saddened, men, of, letters, because, he, was, not, able, to, furnish, the, description, and, the, painting, of, ancient, rome, that, he, was, making, which, was, very, beautiful, raphael, intended, to, make, an, archaeological, map, of, ancient, rome, but, this, was, never, executed, four, archaeological, drawings, by, the, artist, are, preserved, the, vatican, projects, took, most, of, his, time, although, he, painted, several, portraits, including, those, of, his, two, main, patrons, the, popes, julius, ii, and, his, successor, leo, x, the, former, considered, one, of, his, finest, other, portraits, were, of, his, own, friends, like, castiglione, or, the, immediate, papal, circle, other, rulers, pressed, for, work, and, king, francis, i, of, france, was, sent, two, paintings, as, diplomatic, gifts, from, the, pope, for, agostino, chigi, the, hugely, rich, banker, and, papal, treasurer, he, painted, the, triumph, of, galatea, and, designed, further, decorative, frescoes, for, his, villa, farnesina, a, chapel, in, the, church, of, santa, maria, della, pace, and, mosaics, in, the, funerary, chapel, in, santa, maria, del, popolo, he, also, designed, some, of, the, decoration, for, the, villa, madama, the, work, in, both, villas, being, executed, by, his, workshop, one, of, his, most, important, papal, commissions, was, the, raphael, cartoons, now, in, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, a, series, of, 10, cartoons, of, which, seven, survive, for, tapestries, with, scenes, of, the, lives, of, saint, paul, and, saint, peter, for, the, sistine, chapel, the, cartoons, were, sent, to, brussels, to, be, woven, in, the, workshop, of, pier, van, aelst, it, is, possible, that, raphael, saw, the, finished, series, before, his, death, they, were, probably, completed, in, 1520, he, also, designed, and, painted, the, loggie, at, the, vatican, a, long, thin, gallery, then, open, to, a, courtyard, on, one, side, decorated, with, roman, style, grottesche, he, produced, a, number, of, significant, altarpieces, including, the, ecstasy, of, st, cecilia, and, the, sistine, madonna, his, last, work, on, which, he, was, working, up, to, his, death, was, a, large, transfiguration, which, together, with, il, spasimo, shows, the, direction, his, art, was, taking, in, his, final, years, more, proto, baroque, than, mannerist, raphael, painted, several, of, his, works, on, wood, support, madonna, of, the, pinks, but, he, also, used, canvas, sistine, madonna, and, he, was, known, to, employ, drying, oils, such, as, linseed, or, walnut, oils, his, palette, was, rich, and, he, used, almost, all, of, the, then, available, pigments, such, as, ultramarine, lead, tin, yellow, carmine, vermilion, madder, lake, verdigris, and, ochres, in, several, of, his, paintings, ansidei, madonna, he, even, employed, the, rare, brazilwood, lake, metallic, powdered, gold, and, even, less, known, metallic, powdered, bismuth, vasari, says, that, raphael, eventually, had, a, workshop, of, fifty, pupils, and, assistants, many, of, whom, later, became, significant, artists, in, their, own, right, this, was, arguably, the, largest, workshop, team, assembled, under, any, single, old, master, painter, and, much, higher, than, the, norm, they, included, established, masters, from, other, parts, of, italy, probably, working, with, their, own, teams, as, sub, contractors, as, well, as, pupils, and, journeymen, we, have, very, little, evidence, of, the, internal, working, arrangements, of, the, workshop, apart, from, the, works, of, art, themselves, which, are, often, very, difficult, to, assign, to, a, particular, hand, the, most, important, figures, were, giulio, romano, a, young, pupil, from, rome, only, about, twenty, one, at, raphael, s, death, and, gianfrancesco, penni, already, a, florentine, master, they, were, left, many, of, raphael, s, drawings, and, other, possessions, and, to, some, extent, continued, the, workshop, after, raphael, s, death, penni, did, not, achieve, a, personal, reputation, equal, to, giulio, s, as, after, raphael, s, death, he, became, giulio, s, less, than, equal, collaborator, in, turn, for, much, of, his, subsequent, career, perino, del, vaga, already, a, master, and, polidoro, da, caravaggio, who, was, supposedly, promoted, from, a, labourer, carrying, building, materials, on, the, site, also, became, notable, painters, in, their, own, right, polidoro, s, partner, maturino, da, firenze, has, like, penni, been, overshadowed, in, subsequent, reputation, by, his, partner, giovanni, da, udine, had, a, more, independent, status, and, was, responsible, for, the, decorative, stucco, work, and, grotesques, surrounding, the, main, frescoes, most, of, the, artists, were, later, scattered, and, some, killed, by, the, violent, sack, of, rome, in, 1527, this, did, however, contribute, to, the, diffusion, of, versions, of, raphael, s, style, around, italy, and, beyond, vasari, emphasises, that, raphael, ran, a, very, harmonious, and, efficient, workshop, and, had, extraordinary, skill, in, smoothing, over, troubles, and, arguments, with, both, patrons, and, his, assistants, a, contrast, with, the, stormy, pattern, of, michelangelo, s, relationships, with, both, however, though, both, penni, and, giulio, were, sufficiently, skilled, that, distinguishing, between, their, hands, and, that, of, raphael, himself, is, still, sometimes, difficult, there, is, no, doubt, that, many, of, raphael, s, later, wall, paintings, and, probably, some, of, his, easel, paintings, are, more, notable, for, their, design, than, their, execution, many, of, his, portraits, if, in, good, condition, show, his, brilliance, in, the, detailed, handling, of, paint, right, up, to, the, end, of, his, life, other, pupils, or, assistants, include, raffaellino, del, colle, andrea, sabbatini, bartolommeo, ramenghi, pellegrino, aretusi, vincenzo, tamagni, battista, dossi, tommaso, vincidor, timoteo, viti, the, urbino, painter, and, the, sculptor, and, architect, lorenzetto, giulio, s, brother, in, law, the, printmakers, and, architects, in, raphael, s, circle, are, discussed, below, it, has, been, claimed, the, flemish, bernard, van, orley, worked, for, raphael, for, a, time, and, luca, penni, brother, of, gianfrancesco, and, later, a, member, of, the, first, school, of, fontainebleau, may, have, been, a, member, of, the, team, raphael, was, one, of, the, finest, draftsmen, in, the, history, of, western, art, and, used, drawings, extensively, to, plan, his, compositions, according, to, a, near, contemporary, when, beginning, to, plan, a, composition, he, would, lay, out, a, large, number, of, stock, drawings, of, his, on, the, floor, and, begin, to, draw, rapidly, borrowing, figures, from, here, and, there, over, forty, sketches, survive, for, the, disputa, in, the, stanze, and, there, may, well, have, been, many, more, originally, over, four, hundred, sheets, survive, altogether, he, used, different, drawings, to, refine, his, poses, and, compositions, apparently, to, a, greater, extent, than, most, other, painters, to, judge, by, the, number, of, variants, that, survive, this, is, how, raphael, himself, who, was, so, rich, in, inventiveness, used, to, work, always, coming, up, with, four, or, six, ways, to, show, a, narrative, each, one, different, from, the, rest, and, all, of, them, full, of, grace, and, well, done, wrote, another, writer, after, his, death, for, john, shearman, raphael, s, art, marks, a, shift, of, resources, away, from, production, to, research, and, development, when, a, final, composition, was, achieved, scaled, up, full, size, cartoons, were, often, made, which, were, then, pricked, with, a, pin, and, pounced, with, a, bag, of, soot, to, leave, dotted, lines, on, the, surface, as, a, guide, he, also, made, unusually, extensive, use, on, both, paper, and, plaster, of, a, blind, stylus, scratching, lines, which, leave, only, an, indentation, but, no, mark, these, can, be, seen, on, the, wall, in, the, school, of, athens, and, in, the, originals, of, many, drawings, the, raphael, cartoons, as, tapestry, designs, were, fully, coloured, in, a, glue, distemper, medium, as, they, were, sent, to, brussels, to, be, followed, by, the, weavers, in, later, works, painted, by, the, workshop, the, drawings, are, often, painfully, more, attractive, than, the, paintings, most, raphael, drawings, are, rather, precise, even, initial, sketches, with, naked, outline, figures, are, carefully, drawn, and, later, working, drawings, often, have, a, high, degree, of, finish, with, shading, and, sometimes, highlights, in, white, they, lack, the, freedom, and, energy, of, some, of, leonardo, s, and, michelangelo, s, sketches, but, are, nearly, always, aesthetically, very, satisfying, he, was, one, of, the, last, artists, to, use, metalpoint, literally, a, sharp, pointed, piece, of, silver, or, another, metal, extensively, although, he, also, made, superb, use, of, the, freer, medium, of, red, or, black, chalk, in, his, final, years, he, was, one, of, the, first, artists, to, use, female, models, for, preparatory, drawings, male, pupils, garzoni, were, normally, used, for, studies, of, both, sexes, raphael, made, no, prints, himself, but, entered, into, a, collaboration, with, marcantonio, raimondi, to, produce, engravings, to, raphael, s, designs, which, created, many, of, the, most, famous, italian, prints, of, the, century, and, was, important, in, the, rise, of, the, reproductive, print, his, interest, was, unusual, in, such, a, major, artist, from, his, contemporaries, it, was, only, shared, by, titian, who, had, worked, much, less, successfully, with, raimondi, a, total, of, about, fifty, prints, were, made, some, were, copies, of, raphael, s, paintings, but, other, designs, were, apparently, created, by, raphael, purely, to, be, turned, into, prints, raphael, made, preparatory, drawings, many, of, which, survive, for, raimondi, to, translate, into, engraving, the, most, famous, original, prints, to, result, from, the, collaboration, were, lucretia, the, judgement, of, paris, and, the, massacre, of, the, innocents, of, which, two, virtually, identical, versions, were, engraved, among, prints, of, the, paintings, the, parnassus, with, considerable, differences, and, galatea, were, also, especially, well, known, outside, italy, reproductive, prints, by, raimondi, and, others, were, the, main, way, that, raphael, s, art, was, experienced, until, the, twentieth, century, baviero, carocci, called, il, baviera, by, vasari, an, assistant, who, raphael, evidently, trusted, with, his, money, ended, up, in, control, of, most, of, the, copper, plates, after, raphael, s, death, and, had, a, successful, career, in, the, new, occupation, of, a, publisher, of, prints, from, 1517, until, his, death, raphael, lived, in, the, palazzo, caprini, lying, at, the, corner, between, piazza, scossacavalli, and, via, alessandrina, in, the, borgo, in, rather, grand, style, in, a, palace, designed, by, bramante, he, never, married, but, in, 1514, became, engaged, to, maria, bibbiena, cardinal, bibbiena, s, niece, he, seems, to, have, been, talked, into, this, by, his, friend, the, cardinal, and, his, lack, of, enthusiasm, seems, to, be, shown, by, the, marriage, not, having, taken, place, before, she, died, in, 1520, he, is, said, to, have, had, many, affairs, but, a, permanent, fixture, in, his, life, in, rome, was, la, fornarina, margherita, luti, the, daughter, of, a, baker, fornaro, named, francesco, luti, from, siena, who, lived, at, via, del, governo, vecchio, he, was, made, a, groom, of, the, chamber, of, the, pope, which, gave, him, status, at, court, and, an, additional, income, and, also, a, knight, of, the, papal, order, of, the, golden, spur, vasari, claims, that, he, had, toyed, with, the, ambition, of, becoming, a, cardinal, perhaps, after, some, encouragement, from, leo, which, also, may, account, for, his, delaying, his, marriage, raphael, died, on, good, friday, april, 6, 1520, which, was, possibly, his, 37th, birthday, vasari, says, that, raphael, had, also, been, born, on, a, good, friday, which, in, 1483, fell, on, march, 28, and, that, the, artist, died, from, exhaustion, brought, on, by, unceasing, romantic, interests, while, he, was, working, on, the, loggia, several, other, possibilities, for, his, death, have, been, raised, by, later, historians, and, scientists, such, as, a, combination, of, an, infectious, disease, and, bloodletting, in, his, acute, illness, which, lasted, fifteen, days, raphael, was, composed, enough, to, confess, his, sins, receive, the, last, rites, and, put, his, affairs, in, order, he, dictated, his, will, in, which, he, left, sufficient, funds, for, his, mistress, s, care, entrusted, to, his, loyal, servant, baviera, and, left, most, of, his, studio, contents, to, giulio, romano, and, penni, at, his, request, raphael, was, buried, in, the, pantheon, raphael, s, funeral, was, extremely, grand, attended, by, large, crowds, according, to, a, journal, by, paris, de, grassis, four, cardinals, dressed, in, purple, carried, his, body, the, hand, of, which, was, kissed, by, the, pope, the, inscription, on, raphael, s, marble, sarcophagus, an, elegiac, distich, written, by, pietro, bembo, reads, here, lies, that, famous, raphael, by, whom, nature, feared, to, be, conquered, while, he, lived, and, when, he, was, dying, feared, herself, to, die, raphael, was, highly, admired, by, his, contemporaries, although, his, influence, on, artistic, style, in, his, own, century, was, less, than, that, of, michelangelo, mannerism, beginning, at, the, time, of, his, death, and, later, the, baroque, took, art, in, a, direction, totally, opposed, to, raphael, s, qualities, with, raphael, s, death, classic, art, the, high, renaissance, subsided, as, walter, friedl, nder, put, it, he, was, soon, seen, as, the, ideal, model, by, those, disliking, the, excesses, of, mannerism, the, opinion, was, generally, held, in, the, middle, of, the, sixteenth, century, that, raphael, was, the, ideal, balanced, painter, universal, in, his, talent, satisfying, all, the, absolute, standards, and, obeying, all, the, rules, which, were, supposed, to, govern, the, arts, whereas, michelangelo, was, the, eccentric, genius, more, brilliant, than, any, other, artists, in, his, particular, field, the, drawing, of, the, male, nude, but, unbalanced, and, lacking, in, certain, qualities, such, as, grace, and, restraint, essential, to, the, great, artist, those, like, dolce, and, aretino, who, held, this, view, were, usually, the, survivors, of, renaissance, humanism, unable, to, follow, michelangelo, as, he, moved, on, into, mannerism, vasari, himself, despite, his, hero, remaining, michelangelo, came, to, see, his, influence, as, harmful, in, some, ways, and, added, passages, to, the, second, edition, of, the, lives, expressing, similar, views, raphael, s, compositions, were, always, admired, and, studied, and, became, the, cornerstone, of, the, training, of, the, academies, of, art, his, period, of, greatest, influence, was, from, the, late, 17th, to, late, 19th, centuries, when, his, perfect, decorum, and, balance, were, greatly, admired, he, was, seen, as, the, best, model, for, the, history, painting, regarded, as, the, highest, in, the, hierarchy, of, genres, sir, joshua, reynolds, in, his, discourses, praised, his, simple, grave, and, majestic, dignity, and, said, he, stands, in, general, foremost, of, the, first, painters, especially, for, his, frescoes, in, which, he, included, the, raphael, cartoons, whereas, michael, angelo, claims, the, next, attention, he, did, not, possess, so, many, excellences, as, raffaelle, but, those, he, had, were, of, the, highest, kind, echoing, the, sixteenth, century, views, above, reynolds, goes, on, to, say, of, raphael, the, excellency, of, this, extraordinary, man, lay, in, the, propriety, beauty, and, majesty, of, his, characters, his, judicious, contrivance, of, his, composition, correctness, of, drawing, purity, of, taste, and, the, skilful, accommodation, of, other, men, s, conceptions, to, his, own, purpose, nobody, excelled, him, in, that, judgment, with, which, he, united, to, his, own, observations, on, nature, the, energy, of, michael, angelo, and, the, beauty, and, simplicity, of, the, antique, to, the, question, therefore, which, ought, to, hold, the, first, rank, raffaelle, or, michael, angelo, it, must, be, answered, that, if, it, is, to, be, given, to, him, who, possessed, a, greater, combination, of, the, higher, qualities, of, the, art, than, any, other, man, there, is, no, doubt, but, raffaelle, is, the, first, but, if, according, to, longinus, the, sublime, being, the, highest, excellence, that, human, composition, can, attain, to, abundantly, compensates, the, absence, of, every, other, beauty, and, atones, for, all, other, deficiencies, then, michael, angelo, demands, the, preference, reynolds, was, less, enthusiastic, about, raphael, s, panel, paintings, but, the, slight, sentimentality, of, these, made, them, enormously, popular, in, the, 19th, century, we, have, been, familiar, with, them, from, childhood, onwards, through, a, far, greater, mass, of, reproductions, than, any, other, artist, in, the, world, has, ever, had, wrote, w, lfflin, who, was, born, in, 1862, of, raphael, s, madonnas, in, germany, raphael, had, an, immense, influence, on, religious, art, of, the, nazarene, movement, and, d, sseldorf, school, of, painting, in, the, 19th, century, in, contrast, in, england, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, explicitly, reacted, against, his, influence, and, that, of, his, admirers, such, as, joshua, reynolds, seeking, to, return, to, styles, that, pre, dated, what, they, saw, as, his, baneful, influence, according, to, a, critic, whose, ideas, greatly, influenced, them, john, ruskin, the, doom, of, the, arts, of, europe, went, forth, from, that, chamber, and, it, was, brought, about, in, great, part, by, the, very, excellencies, of, the, man, who, had, thus, marked, the, commencement, of, decline, the, perfection, of, execution, and, the, beauty, of, feature, which, were, attained, in, his, works, and, in, those, of, his, great, contemporaries, rendered, finish, of, execution, and, beauty, of, form, the, chief, objects, of, all, artists, and, thenceforward, execution, was, looked, for, rather, than, thought, and, beauty, rather, than, veracity, and, as, i, told, you, these, are, the, two, secondary, causes, of, the, decline, of, art, the, first, being, the, loss, of, moral, purpose, pray, note, them, clearly, in, medi, val, art, thought, is, the, first, thing, execution, the, second, in, modern, art, execution, is, the, first, thing, and, thought, the, second, and, again, in, medi, val, art, truth, is, first, beauty, second, in, modern, art, beauty, is, first, truth, second, the, medi, val, principles, led, up, to, raphael, and, the, modern, principles, lead, down, from, him, by, 1900, raphael, s, popularity, was, surpassed, by, michelangelo, and, leonardo, perhaps, as, a, reaction, against, the, etiolated, raphaelism, of, 19th, century, academic, artists, such, as, bouguereau, although, art, historian, bernard, berenson, in, 1952, termed, raphael, the, most, famous, and, most, loved, master, of, the, high, renaissance, art, historians, leopold, and, helen, ettlinger, say, that, raphael, s, lesser, popularity, in, the, 20th, century, is, made, obvious, by, the, contents, of, art, library, shelves, in, contrast, to, volume, upon, volume, that, reproduce, yet, again, detailed, photographs, of, the, sistine, ceiling, or, leonardo, s, drawings, the, literature, on, raphael, particularly, in, english, is, limited, to, only, a, few, books, they, conclude, nonetheless, that, of, all, the, great, renaissance, masters, raphael, s, influence, is, the, most, continuous, footnotes, citations
