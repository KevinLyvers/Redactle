when, i, am, accused, of, being, excessive, by, the, critics, they, re, talking, about, moments, like, that, but, i, wouldn, t, take, it, out, for, the, world, it, actually, happened, believe, me, if,

struggling, to, be, accepted, by, them, he, discovered, his, first, strong, sense, of, self, in, america, within, the, family, of, the, group, theatre, and, more, loosely, in, the, radical, social, and, cultural, movements, of, the, time, writes, film, author, joanna, e, rapf, 23, in, kazan, s, autobiography, he, writes, of, the, lasting, impact, on, him, of, the, group, noting, in, particular,

you, may, have, talent, for, something, but, it, s, certainly, not, acting, kazan, in, his, autobiography, also, describes, strasberg, as, a, vital, leader, of, the, group, he, carried, with, him, the, aura, of, a, prophet, a, magician, a, witch, doctor, a, psychoanalyst, and, a, feared, father, of, a, jewish, home, e, was, the, force, that, held, the, thirty, odd, members, of, the, theatre,

leading, taxi, driver, in, a, drama, by, clifford, odets, waiting, for, lefty, and, his, performance, was, called, dynamic, leading, some, to, describe, him, as, the, proletarian, thunderbolt, 23, among, the, themes, that, would, run, through, all, of, his, work, were, personal, alienation, and, an, outrage, over, social, injustice, writes, film, critic, william, baer, other, critics, have,

introduced, the, method, to, the, actors, studio, an, umbrella, term, for, a, constellation, of, systemizations, of, konstantin, stanislavski, s, teachings, the, method, school, of, acting, became, the, predominant, system, of, post, world, war, ii, hollywood, among, strasberg, s, students, were, montgomery, clift, mildred, dunnock, julie, harris, karl, malden, patricia, neal, maureen,

though, at, the, height, of, his, stage, success, kazan, turned, to, hollywood, as, a, director, of, motion, pictures, he, first, directed, two, short, films, but, his, first, feature, film, was, a, tree, grows, in, brooklyn, 1945, one, of, his, first, attempts, to, film, dramas, focused, on, contemporary, concerns, which, later, became, his, forte, two, years, later, he, directed, gentleman, s, agreement, where, he, tackled, a, seldom, discussed, topic, in, america, antisemitism, for, which, he, won, his, first, oscar, as, best, director, in, 1947, he, directed, the, courtroom, drama, boomerang, in, 1949, he, again, dealt, with, a, controversial, subject, when, he, directed, pinky, which, dealt, with, issues, of, racism, in, america, and, was, nominated, for, three, academy, awards, in, 1950, he, directed, panic, in, the, streets, starring, richard, widmark, a, thriller, shot, on, the, streets, of, new, orleans, in, that, film, kazan, experimented, with, a, documentary, style, of, cinematography, which, succeeded, in, energizing, the, action, scenes, he, won, the, venice, film, festival, international, award, as, director, and, the, film, also, won, two, academy, awards, kazan, had, requested, that, zero, mostel, also, act, in, the, film, despite, mostel, being, blacklisted, as, a, result, of, hcua, testimony, a, few, years, earlier, kazan, writes, of, his, decision, each, director, has, a, favorite, in, his, cast, my, favorite, this, time, was, zero, mostel, i, thought, him, an, extraordinary, artist, and, a, delightful, companion, one, of, the, funniest, and, most, original, men, i, d, ever, met, i, constantly, sought, his, company, he, was, one, of, the, three, people, whom, i, rescued, from, the, industry, s, blacklist, for, a, long, time, zero, had, not, been, able, to, get, work, in, films, but, i, got, him, in, my, film, 383, in, 1951, after, introducing, and, directing, marlon, brando, and, karl, malden, in, the, stage, version, he, went, on, to, cast, both, in, the, film, version, of, the, play, a, streetcar, named, desire, which, won, four, oscars, being, nominated, for, 12, despite, these, plaudits, the, film, was, considered, a, step, back, cinematically, with, the, feel, of, filmed, theater, though, kazan, did, at, first, use, a, more, open, setting, he, then, felt, compelled, to, revert, to, the, stage, atmosphere, to, remain, true, to, the, script, he, explains, on, streetcar, we, worked, very, hard, to, open, it, up, and, then, went, back, to, the, play, because, we, d, lost, all, the, compression, in, the, play, these, people, were, trapped, in, a, room, with, each, other, what, i, actually, did, was, to, make, the, set, smaller, as, the, story, progressed, the, set, got, smaller, and, smaller, kazan, s, next, film, was, viva, zapata, 1952, which, also, starred, marlon, brando, this, time, the, film, added, real, atmosphere, with, the, use, of, location, shots, and, strong, character, accents, kazan, called, this, his, first, real, film, because, of, those, factors, in, 1954, he, again, used, brando, as, a, star, in, on, the, waterfront, as, a, continuation, of, the, socially, relevant, themes, that, he, developed, in, new, york, the, film, exposed, corruption, within, new, york, s, longshoremen, s, union, it, too, was, nominated, for, 12, academy, awards, and, won, 8, including, best, picture, best, director, and, best, actor, for, marlon, brando, on, the, waterfront, was, also, the, screen, debut, for, eva, marie, saint, who, won, the, oscar, for, best, supporting, actress, for, her, role, saint, recalls, that, kazan, selected, her, for, the, role, after, he, had, her, do, an, improvisational, skit, with, brando, playing, the, other, character, she, had, no, idea, that, he, was, looking, to, fill, any, particular, film, part, however, but, remembers, that, kazan, set, up, the, scenario, with, brando, which, brought, out, surprising, emotions, i, ended, up, crying, crying, and, laughing, i, mean, there, was, such, an, attraction, there, that, smile, of, his, he, was, very, tender, and, funny, and, kazan, in, his, genius, saw, the, chemistry, there, 295, 296, life, magazine, described, on, the, waterfront, as, the, most, brutal, movie, of, the, year, but, with, the, year, s, tenderest, love, scenes, and, stating, that, saint, was, a, new, discovery, in, films, in, its, cover, story, about, saint, it, speculated, that, it, will, probably, be, as, edie, in, on, the, waterfront, that, she, starts, her, real, trip, to, fame, the, film, made, use, of, extensive, on, location, street, scenes, and, waterfront, shots, and, included, a, notable, score, by, noted, composer, leonard, bernstein, after, the, success, of, on, the, waterfront, he, went, on, to, direct, another, screen, adaptation, of, a, john, steinbeck, novel, east, of, eden, 1955, as, director, kazan, again, used, another, unknown, actor, james, dean, kazan, had, seen, dean, on, stage, in, new, york, and, after, an, audition, gave, him, the, starring, role, along, with, an, exclusive, contract, with, warner, bros, dean, flew, back, to, los, angeles, with, kazan, in, 1954, the, first, time, he, had, ever, flown, in, a, plane, bringing, his, clothes, in, a, brown, paper, bag, the, film, s, success, introduced, james, dean, to, the, world, and, established, him, as, a, popular, actor, he, went, on, to, star, in, rebel, without, a, cause, 1955, directed, by, kazan, s, friend, nicholas, ray, and, then, giant, 1956, directed, by, george, stevens, author, douglas, rathgeb, describes, the, difficulties, kazan, had, in, turning, dean, into, a, new, star, noting, how, dean, was, a, controversial, figure, at, warner, bros, from, the, time, he, arrived, there, were, rumors, that, he, kept, a, loaded, gun, in, his, studio, trailer, that, he, drove, his, motorcycle, dangerously, down, studio, streets, or, sound, stages, that, he, had, bizarre, and, unsavory, friends, as, a, result, kazan, was, forced, to, baby, sit, the, young, actor, in, side, by, side, trailers, so, he, would, not, run, away, during, production, co, star, julie, harris, worked, overtime, to, quell, dean, s, panic, attacks, in, general, dean, was, oblivious, to, hollywood, s, methods, and, rathgeb, notes, that, his, radical, style, did, not, mesh, with, hollywood, s, corporate, gears, dean, was, amazed, at, his, own, performance, on, screen, when, he, later, viewed, a, rough, cut, of, the, film, kazan, had, invited, director, nicholas, ray, to, a, private, showing, with, dean, as, ray, was, looking, for, someone, to, play, the, lead, in, rebel, without, a, cause, ray, watched, dean, s, powerful, acting, on, the, screen, but, it, seemed, impossible, that, it, was, the, same, person, in, the, room, ray, felt, dean, was, shy, and, totally, withdrawn, as, he, sat, there, hunched, over, dean, himself, did, not, seem, to, believe, it, notes, rathgeb, he, watched, himself, with, an, odd, almost, adolescent, fascination, as, if, he, were, admiring, someone, else, the, film, also, made, good, use, of, on, location, and, outdoor, scenes, along, with, effective, use, of, early, widescreen, format, making, the, film, one, of, kazan, s, most, accomplished, works, james, dean, died, the, following, year, at, the, age, of, 24, in, an, accident, with, his, sports, car, about, 200, miles, north, of, los, angeles, he, had, only, made, three, films, and, the, only, completed, film, he, ever, saw, was, east, of, eden, in, 1961, kazan, introduced, warren, beatty, in, his, first, screen, appearance, with, a, starring, role, in, splendor, in, the, grass, 1961, with, natalie, wood, the, film, was, nominated, for, two, oscars, and, won, one, author, peter, biskind, points, out, that, kazan, was, the, first, in, a, string, of, major, directors, beatty, sought, out, mentors, or, father, figures, from, whom, he, wanted, to, learn, biskind, notes, also, that, they, were, wildly, dissimilar, mentor, vs, prot, g, director, vs, actor, immigrant, outsider, vs, native, son, kazan, was, armed, with, the, confidence, born, of, age, and, success, while, beatty, was, virtually, aflame, with, the, arrogance, of, youth, kazan, recalls, his, impressions, of, beatty, warren, it, was, obvious, the, first, time, i, saw, him, wanted, it, all, and, wanted, it, his, way, why, not, he, had, the, energy, a, very, keen, intelligence, and, more, chutzpah, than, any, jew, i, ve, ever, known, even, more, than, me, bright, as, they, come, intrepid, and, with, that, thing, all, women, secretly, respect, complete, confidence, in, his, sexual, powers, confidence, so, great, that, he, never, had, to, advertise, himself, even, by, hints, 603, biskind, describes, an, episode, during, the, first, week, of, shooting, where, beatty, was, angered, at, something, kazan, said, the, star, lashed, out, at, the, spot, where, he, knew, kazan, was, most, vulnerable, the, director, s, friendly, testimony, before, the, hcua, he, snapped, lemme, ask, you, something, why, did, you, name, all, those, names, beatty, recalled, the, episode, in, some, patricidal, attempt, to, stand, up, to, the, great, kazan, i, arrogantly, and, stupidly, challenged, him, on, it, biskind, describes, how, kazan, grabbed, his, arm, asking, what, did, you, say, and, dragged, him, off, to, a, tiny, dressing, room, whereupon, the, director, proceeded, to, justify, himself, for, two, hours, beatty, years, later, during, a, kennedy, center, tribute, to, kazan, stated, to, the, audience, that, kazan, had, given, him, the, most, important, break, in, his, career, 23, beatty, s, costar, natalie, wood, was, in, a, transition, period, in, her, career, having, mostly, been, cast, in, roles, as, a, child, or, teenager, and, she, was, now, hoping, to, be, cast, in, adult, roles, biographer, suzanne, finstad, notes, that, a, turning, point, in, her, life, as, an, actress, was, upon, seeing, the, film, a, streetcar, named, desire, she, was, transformed, in, awe, of, kazan, and, of, vivien, leigh, s, performance, became, a, role, model, for, natalie, 107, in, 1961, after, a, series, of, bad, films, her, career, was, already, in, decline, notes, rathgeb, 199, kazan, writes, that, the, sages, of, the, film, community, declared, her, as, washed, up, as, an, actress, although, he, still, wanted, to, interview, her, for, his, next, film, when, i, saw, her, i, detected, behind, the, well, mannered, young, wife, front, a, desperate, twinkle, in, her, eyes, i, talked, with, her, more, quietly, then, and, more, personally, i, wanted, to, find, out, what, human, material, was, there, what, her, inner, life, was, then, she, told, me, she, was, being, psychoanalyzed, that, did, it, poor, r, j, i, said, to, myself, i, liked, bob, wagner, i, still, do, 602, kazan, cast, her, as, the, female, lead, in, splendor, in, the, grass, and, her, career, rebounded, finstad, feels, that, despite, wood, never, receiving, training, in, method, acting, techniques, working, with, kazan, brought, her, to, the, greatest, emotional, heights, of, her, career, the, experience, was, exhilarating, but, wrenching, for, natalie, who, faced, her, demons, on, splendor, 259, she, adds, that, a, scene, in, the, film, as, a, result, of, kazan, s, wizardry, produced, a, hysteria, in, natalie, that, may, be, her, most, powerful, moment, as, an, actress, 260, actor, gary, lockwood, who, also, acted, in, the, film, felt, that, kazan, and, natalie, were, a, terrific, marriage, because, you, had, this, beautiful, girl, and, you, had, somebody, that, could, get, things, out, of, her, kazan, s, favorite, scene, in, the, movie, was, the, last, one, when, wood, goes, back, to, see, her, lost, first, love, bud, beatty, it, s, terribly, touching, to, me, i, still, like, it, when, i, see, it, writes, kazan, 263, and, i, certainly, didn, t, need, to, tell, her, how, to, play, it, she, understood, it, perfectly, kazan, was, noted, for, his, close, collaboration, with, screenwriters, on, broadway, he, worked, with, arthur, miller, tennessee, williams, and, william, inge, in, film, he, worked, again, with, willams, a, streetcar, named, desire, and, baby, doll, inge, splendor, in, the, grass, budd, schulberg, on, the, waterfront, and, a, face, in, the, crowd, john, steinbeck, viva, zapata, and, harold, pinter, the, last, tycoon, as, an, instrumental, figure, in, the, careers, of, many, of, the, best, writers, of, his, time, he, always, treated, them, and, their, work, with, the, utmost, respect, in, 2009, a, previously, unproduced, screenplay, by, williams, the, loss, of, a, teardrop, diamond, was, released, as, a, film, williams, wrote, the, screenplay, specifically, for, kazan, to, direct, during, the, 1950s, williams, became, one, of, kazan, s, closest, and, most, loyal, friends, and, kazan, often, pulled, williams, out, of, creative, slumps, by, redirecting, his, focus, with, new, ideas, in, 1959, in, a, letter, to, kazan, he, writes, some, day, you, will, know, how, much, i, value, the, great, things, you, did, with, my, work, how, you, lifted, it, above, its, measure, by, your, great, gift, among, kazan, s, other, films, were, panic, in, the, streets, 1950, east, of, eden, 1955, baby, doll, 1956, wild, river, 1960, and, the, last, tycoon, 1976, kazan, strove, for, cinematic, realism, a, quality, he, often, achieved, by, discovering, and, working, with, unknown, actors, many, of, whom, treated, him, as, their, mentor, which, gave, him, the, flexibility, to, depict, social, reality, with, both, accuracy, and, vivid, intensity, he, also, felt, that, casting, the, right, actors, accounted, for, 90, of, a, movie, s, ultimate, success, or, failure, as, a, result, of, his, efforts, he, also, gave, actors, such, as, lee, remick, jo, van, fleet, warren, beatty, andy, griffith, james, dean, and, jack, palance, their, first, major, movie, roles, he, explained, to, director, and, producer, george, stevens, jr, that, he, felt, that, big, stars, are, barely, trained, or, not, very, well, trained, they, also, have, bad, habits, they, re, not, pliable, anymore, kazan, also, describes, how, and, why, he, gets, to, know, his, actors, on, a, personal, level, now, what, i, try, to, do, is, get, to, know, them, very, well, i, take, them, to, dinner, i, talk, to, them, i, meet, their, wives, i, find, out, what, the, hell, the, human, material, is, that, i, m, dealing, with, so, that, by, the, time, i, take, an, unknown, he, s, not, an, unknown, to, me, kazan, goes, on, to, describe, how, he, got, to, understand, james, dean, as, an, example, when, i, met, him, he, said, i, ll, take, you, for, a, ride, on, my, motorbike, it, was, his, way, of, communicating, with, me, saying, i, hope, you, like, me, i, thought, he, was, an, extreme, grotesque, of, a, boy, a, twisted, boy, as, i, got, to, know, his, father, as, i, got, to, know, about, his, family, i, learned, that, he, had, been, in, fact, twisted, by, the, denial, of, love, i, went, to, jack, warner, and, told, him, i, wanted, to, use, an, absolutely, unknown, boy, jack, was, a, crapshooter, of, the, first, order, and, said, go, ahead, kazan, chose, his, subjects, to, express, personal, and, social, events, that, he, was, familiar, with, he, described, his, thought, process, before, taking, on, a, project, i, don, t, move, unless, i, have, some, empathy, with, the, basic, theme, in, some, way, the, channel, of, the, film, should, also, be, in, my, own, life, i, start, with, an, instinct, with, east, of, eden, it, s, really, the, story, of, my, father, and, me, and, i, didn, t, realize, it, for, a, long, time, in, some, subtle, or, not, so, subtle, way, every, film, is, autobiographical, a, thing, in, my, life, is, expressed, by, the, essence, of, the, film, then, i, know, it, experientially, not, just, mentally, i, ve, got, to, feel, that, it, s, in, some, way, about, me, some, way, about, my, struggles, some, way, about, my, pain, my, hopes, film, historian, joanna, e, rapf, notes, that, among, the, methods, kazan, used, in, his, work, with, actors, was, his, initial, focus, on, reality, although, his, style, was, not, defined, as, naturalistic, she, adds, he, respects, his, script, but, casts, and, directs, with, a, particular, eye, for, expressive, action, and, the, use, of, emblematic, objects, 33, kazan, stated, that, unless, the, character, is, somewhere, in, the, actor, himself, you, shouldn, t, cast, him, 33, in, his, later, years, he, changed, his, mind, about, some, of, the, philosophy, behind, the, group, theatre, in, that, he, no, longer, felt, that, the, theater, was, a, collective, art, as, he, once, believed, to, be, successful, it, should, express, the, vision, the, conviction, and, the, insistent, presence, of, one, person, film, author, peter, biskind, described, kazan, s, career, as, fully, committed, to, art, and, politics, with, the, politics, feeding, the, work, 22, kazan, however, has, downplayed, that, impression, i, don, t, think, basically, i, m, a, political, animal, i, think, i, m, a, self, centered, animal, i, think, what, i, was, concerned, about, all, my, life, was, to, say, something, artistically, that, was, uniquely, my, own, 22, nonetheless, there, have, been, clear, messages, in, some, of, his, films, that, involved, politics, in, various, ways, in, 1954, he, directed, on, the, waterfront, written, by, screenwriter, budd, schulberg, which, was, a, film, about, union, corruption, in, new, york, some, critics, consider, it, one, of, the, greatest, films, in, the, history, of, international, cinema, another, political, film, was, a, face, in, the, crowd, 1957, his, protagonist, played, by, andy, griffith, in, his, film, debut, is, not, a, politician, yet, his, career, suddenly, becomes, deeply, involved, in, politics, according, to, film, author, harry, keyishian, kazan, and, screenwriter, budd, schulberg, were, using, the, film, to, warn, audiences, about, the, dangerous, potential, of, the, new, medium, of, television, kazan, explains, that, he, and, schulberg, were, trying, to, warn, of, the, power, tv, would, have, in, the, political, life, of, the, nation, kazan, states, listen, to, what, the, candidate, says, don, t, be, taken, in, by, his, charm, or, his, trust, inspiring, personality, don, t, buy, the, advertisement, buy, what, s, in, the, package, as, a, product, of, the, group, theatre, and, actors, studio, he, was, most, noted, for, his, use, of, method, actors, especially, brando, and, dean, during, an, interview, in, 1988, kazan, said, i, did, whatever, was, necessary, to, get, a, good, performance, including, so, called, method, acting, i, made, them, run, around, the, set, i, scolded, them, i, inspired, jealousy, in, their, girlfriends, the, director, is, a, desperate, beast, you, don, t, deal, with, actors, as, dolls, you, deal, with, them, as, people, who, are, poets, to, a, certain, degree, actor, robert, de, niro, called, him, a, master, of, a, new, kind, of, psychological, and, behavioral, faith, in, acting, kazan, was, aware, of, the, limited, range, of, his, directing, abilities, i, don, t, have, great, range, i, am, no, good, with, music, or, spectacles, the, classics, are, beyond, me, i, am, a, mediocre, director, except, when, a, play, or, film, touches, a, part, of, my, life, s, experience, i, do, have, courage, even, some, daring, i, am, able, to, talk, to, actors, to, arouse, them, to, better, work, i, have, strong, even, violent, feelings, and, they, are, assets, he, explained, that, he, tried, to, inspire, his, actors, to, offer, ideas, when, i, talk, to, the, actors, they, begin, to, give, me, ideas, and, i, grab, them, because, the, ideas, they, give, me, turn, them, on, i, want, the, breath, of, life, from, them, rather, than, the, mechanical, fulfillment, of, the, movement, which, i, asked, for, i, love, actors, i, used, to, be, an, actor, for, eight, years, so, i, do, appreciate, their, job, kazan, however, held, strong, ideas, about, the, scenes, and, would, try, to, merge, an, actor, s, suggestions, and, inner, feelings, with, his, own, despite, the, strong, eroticism, created, in, baby, doll, for, example, he, set, limits, before, shooting, a, seduction, scene, between, eli, wallach, and, carroll, baker, he, privately, asked, wallach, do, you, think, you, actually, go, through, with, seducing, that, girl, wallach, writes, i, hadn, t, thought, about, that, question, before, but, i, answered, no, kazan, replies, good, idea, play, it, that, way, kazan, many, years, later, explained, his, rationale, for, scenes, in, that, film, what, is, erotic, about, sex, to, me, is, the, seduction, not, the, act, the, scene, on, the, swings, eli, wallach, and, carroll, baker, in, baby, doll, is, my, exact, idea, of, what, eroticism, in, films, should, be, joanna, rapf, adds, that, kazan, was, most, admired, for, his, close, work, with, actors, noting, that, director, nicholas, ray, considered, him, the, best, actor, s, director, the, united, states, has, ever, produced, 22, film, historian, foster, hirsch, explains, that, he, created, virtually, a, new, acting, style, which, was, the, style, of, the, method, allowed, for, the, actors, to, create, great, depth, of, psychological, realism, among, the, actors, who, described, kazan, as, an, important, influence, in, their, career, was, patricia, neal, who, co, starred, with, andy, griffith, in, a, face, in, the, crowd, 1957, he, was, very, good, he, was, an, actor, and, he, knew, how, we, acted, he, would, come, and, talk, to, you, privately, i, liked, him, a, lot, anthony, franciosa, a, supporting, actor, in, the, film, explains, how, kazan, encouraged, his, actors, he, would, always, say, let, me, see, what, you, can, do, let, me, see, it, don, t, talk, to, me, about, it, you, felt, that, you, had, a, man, who, was, completely, on, your, side, no, qualms, about, anything, you, did, he, gave, you, a, tremendous, sense, of, confidence, he, never, made, me, feel, as, though, i, was, acting, for, the, camera, many, times, i, never, even, knew, where, the, camera, was, however, in, order, to, get, quality, acting, from, andy, griffith, in, his, first, screen, appearance, and, achieve, what, schickel, calls, an, astonishing, movie, debut, 338, kazan, would, often, take, surprising, measures, in, one, important, and, highly, emotional, scene, for, example, kazan, had, to, give, griffith, fair, warning, i, may, have, to, use, extraordinary, means, to, make, you, do, this, i, may, have, to, get, out, of, line, i, don, t, know, any, other, way, of, getting, an, extraordinary, performance, out, of, an, actor, actress, terry, moore, calls, kazan, her, best, friend, and, notes, that, he, made, you, feel, better, than, you, thought, you, could, be, i, never, had, another, director, that, ever, touched, him, i, was, spoiled, for, life, he, would, find, out, if, your, life, was, like, the, character, says, carroll, baker, star, of, baby, doll, he, was, the, best, director, with, actors, kazan, s, need, to, remain, close, to, his, actors, continued, up, to, his, last, film, the, last, tycoon, 1976, he, remembered, that, robert, de, niro, the, star, of, the, film, would, do, almost, anything, to, succeed, and, even, cut, his, weight, down, from, 170, to, 128, pounds, for, the, role, kazan, adds, that, de, niro, is, one, of, a, select, number, of, actors, i, ve, directed, who, work, hard, at, their, trade, and, the, only, one, who, asked, to, rehearse, on, sundays, most, of, the, others, play, tennis, bobby, and, i, would, go, over, the, scenes, to, be, shot, 766, the, powerful, dramatic, roles, kazan, brought, out, from, many, of, his, actors, was, due, partly, to, his, ability, to, recognize, their, personal, character, traits, although, he, did, not, know, de, niro, before, this, film, for, example, kazan, later, writes, bobby, is, more, meticulous, he, s, very, imaginative, he, s, very, precise, he, figures, everything, out, both, inside, and, outside, he, has, good, emotion, he, s, a, character, actor, everything, he, does, he, calculates, in, a, good, way, but, he, calculates, 210, kazan, developed, and, used, those, personality, traits, for, his, character, in, the, film, 766, although, the, film, did, poorly, at, the, box, office, some, reviewers, praised, de, niro, s, acting, film, critic, marie, brenner, writes, that, for, de, niro, it, is, a, role, that, surpasses, even, his, brilliant, and, daring, portrayal, of, vito, corleone, in, the, godfather, part, ii, performance, deserves, to, be, compared, with, the, very, finest, marlon, brando, in, his, autobiography, goes, into, detail, about, the, influence, kazan, had, on, his, acting, i, have, worked, with, many, movie, directors, some, good, some, fair, some, terrible, kazan, was, the, best, actors, director, by, far, of, any, i, ve, worked, for, the, only, one, who, ever, really, stimulated, me, got, into, a, part, with, me, and, virtually, acted, it, with, me, he, chose, good, actors, encouraged, them, to, improvise, and, then, improvised, on, the, improvisation, he, gave, his, cast, freedom, and, was, always, emotionally, involved, in, the, process, and, his, instincts, were, perfect, i, ve, never, seen, a, director, who, became, as, deeply, and, emotionally, involved, in, a, scene, as, gadg, he, got, so, wrought, up, that, he, started, chewing, on, his, hat, he, was, an, arch, manipulator, of, actors, feelings, and, he, was, extraordinarily, talented, perhaps, we, will, never, see, his, like, again, kazan, testified, before, the, house, committee, on, un, american, activities, huac, in, 1952, during, the, postwar, era, that, journalist, michael, mills, calls, arguably, the, most, controversial, period, in, hollywood, history, when, kazan, was, in, his, mid, 20s, during, the, depression, years, 1934, to, 1936, he, had, been, a, member, of, the, american, communist, party, in, new, york, for, a, year, and, a, half, in, april, 1952, the, committee, called, on, kazan, under, oath, to, identify, communists, from, that, period, 16, years, earlier, kazan, initially, refused, to, provide, names, but, eventually, named, eight, former, group, theatre, members, who, he, said, had, been, communists, clifford, odets, j, edward, bromberg, lewis, leverett, morris, carnovsky, phoebe, brand, tony, kraber, ted, wellman, and, paula, miller, who, later, married, lee, strasberg, he, testified, that, odets, quit, the, party, at, the, same, time, that, he, did, kazan, said, all, the, persons, named, were, already, known, to, huac, although, this, has, been, contested, kazan, recounts, how, he, received, a, letter, detailing, how, his, naming, of, art, smith, damaged, the, actor, s, career, kazan, s, naming, names, cost, him, many, friends, within, the, film, industry, including, playwright, arthur, miller, although, kazan, notes, the, two, did, work, together, again, kazan, would, later, write, in, his, autobiography, of, the, warrior, pleasure, at, withstanding, his, enemies, when, kazan, received, an, honorary, academy, award, in, 1999, the, audience, was, noticeably, divided, in, their, reaction, with, some, including, nick, nolte, ed, harris, ian, mckellen, frank, langella, and, amy, madigan, refusing, to, applaud, and, others, such, as, actors, kathy, bates, meryl, streep, karl, malden, and, warren, beatty, and, producer, george, stevens, jr, standing, and, applauding, stevens, speculates, on, why, he, beatty, and, many, others, in, the, audience, chose, to, stand, and, applaud, i, never, discussed, it, with, warren, but, i, believe, we, were, both, standing, for, the, same, reason, out, of, regard, for, the, creativity, the, stamina, and, the, many, fierce, battles, and, lonely, nights, that, had, gone, into, the, man, s, twenty, motion, pictures, in, 1982, orson, welles, was, asked, a, question, about, kazan, at, the, cin, math, que, fran, aise, in, paris, welles, replied, ch, re, mademoiselle, you, have, chosen, the, wrong, metteur, en, sc, ne, because, elia, kazan, is, a, traitor, he, is, a, man, who, sold, to, mccarthy, all, his, companions, at, a, time, when, he, could, continue, to, work, in, new, york, at, high, salary, and, having, sold, all, his, people, to, mccarthy, he, then, made, a, film, called, on, the, waterfront, which, was, a, celebration, of, the, informer, while, the, audience, applauded, welles, said, i, have, to, add, that, he, is, a, very, good, director, los, angeles, times, film, critic, kenneth, turan, wrote, the, only, criterion, for, an, award, like, this, is, the, work, kazan, was, already, denied, accolades, from, the, american, film, institute, and, other, film, critics, associations, according, to, mills, it, s, time, for, the, academy, to, recognize, this, genius, adding, that, we, applauded, when, the, great, chaplin, finally, had, his, hour, in, response, joseph, mcbride, former, vice, president, of, the, los, angeles, film, critics, association, claimed, that, an, honorary, award, recognizes, the, totality, of, what, he, represents, and, kazan, s, career, post, 1952, was, built, on, the, ruin, of, other, people, s, careers, in, later, interviews, kazan, explained, some, of, the, early, events, that, made, him, decide, to, become, a, friendly, witness, most, notably, in, relation, to, the, group, theatre, which, he, called, his, first, family, and, the, best, thing, professionally, that, ever, happened, to, him, the, group, theatre, said, that, we, shouldn, t, be, committed, to, any, fixed, political, program, set, by, other, people, outside, the, organization, i, was, behaving, treacherously, to, the, group, when, i, met, downtown, at, cp, headquarters, to, decide, among, the, communists, what, we, should, do, in, the, group, and, then, come, back, and, present, a, united, front, pretending, we, had, not, been, in, caucus, i, was, tried, by, the, party, and, that, was, one, of, the, reasons, i, became, so, embittered, later, the, trial, was, on, the, issue, of, my, refusal, to, follow, instructions, that, we, should, strike, in, the, group, theatre, and, insist, that, the, membership, have, control, of, its, organization, i, said, it, was, an, artistic, organization, and, i, backed, up, clurman, and, strasberg, who, were, not, communists, the, trial, left, an, indelible, impression, on, me, everybody, else, voted, against, me, and, they, stigmatized, me, and, condemned, my, acts, and, attitude, they, were, asking, for, confession, and, self, humbling, i, went, home, that, night, and, told, my, wife, i, am, resigning, but, for, years, after, i, resigned, i, was, still, faithful, to, their, way, of, thinking, i, still, believed, in, it, but, not, in, the, american, communists, i, used, to, make, a, difference, and, think, these, people, here, are, damned, fools, but, in, russia, they, have, got, the, real, thing, until, i, learned, about, the, hitler, stalin, pact, and, gave, up, on, the, ussr, mills, notes, that, prior, to, becoming, a, friendly, witness, kazan, discussed, the, issues, with, miller, to, defend, a, secrecy, i, don, t, think, right, and, to, defend, people, who, have, already, been, named, or, soon, would, be, by, someone, else, i, hate, the, communists, and, have, for, many, years, and, don, t, feel, right, about, giving, up, my, career, to, defend, them, i, will, give, up, my, film, career, if, it, is, in, the, interests, of, defending, something, i, believe, in, but, not, this, miller, put, his, arm, around, kazan, and, retorted, don, t, worry, about, what, i, ll, think, whatever, you, do, is, okay, with, me, because, i, know, that, your, heart, is, in, the, right, place, in, his, memoirs, kazan, writes, that, his, testimony, meant, that, the, big, shot, had, become, the, outsider, he, also, notes, that, it, strengthened, his, friendship, with, another, outsider, tennessee, williams, with, whom, he, collaborated, on, numerous, plays, and, films, he, called, williams, the, most, loyal, and, understanding, friend, i, had, through, those, black, months, 495, kazan, appears, as, a, character, in, names, mark, kemble, s, play, about, former, group, theatre, members, struggles, with, the, house, un, american, activities, committee, kazan, was, married, three, times, his, first, wife, was, playwright, molly, day, thacher, they, were, married, from, 1932, until, her, death, in, 1963, this, marriage, produced, two, daughters, and, two, sons, including, screenwriter, nicholas, kazan, his, second, marriage, to, the, actress, barbara, loden, lasted, from, 1967, until, her, death, in, 1980, and, produced, one, son, his, marriage, in, 1982, to, frances, rudge, continued, until, his, death, in, 2003, aged, 94, in, the, early, 1930s, kazan, and, his, wife, moved, into, an, 1885, farmhouse, in, sandy, hook, connecticut, where, they, raised, their, four, children, they, continued, to, use, the, property, as, a, summer, and, weekend, retreat, until, 1998, when, the, property, was, put, up, for, sale, in, 1978, the, us, government, paid, for, kazan, and, his, family, to, travel, to, kazan, s, birthplace, where, many, of, his, films, were, to, be, shown, during, a, speech, in, athens, he, discussed, his, films, and, his, personal, and, business, life, in, the, us, along, with, the, messages, he, tried, to, convey, in, my, own, view, the, solution, is, to, talk, about, human, beings, and, not, about, abstracts, to, reveal, the, culture, and, the, social, moment, as, it, is, reflected, in, the, behavior, and, the, lives, of, individual, people, not, to, be, correct, to, be, total, so, i, do, not, believe, in, any, ideology, that, does, not, permit, no, encourage, the, freedom, of, the, individual, he, also, offered, his, opinions, about, the, role, of, the, us, as, a, world, model, for, democracy, i, think, you, and, i, all, of, us, have, some, sort, of, stake, in, the, united, states, if, it, fails, the, failure, will, be, that, of, us, all, of, mankind, itself, it, will, cost, us, all, i, think, of, the, united, states, as, a,
