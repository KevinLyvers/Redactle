antonie, philips, van, leeuwenhoek, frs, n, t, n, i, v, n, l, e, v, n, h, u, k, h, k, ahn, t, nee, vahn, lay, v, n, hook, huuk, dutch, 24, october, 1632, 26, august, 1723, was, a, dutch, microbiologist, and, microscopist, in, the, golden, age, of, dutch, science, and, technology, a, largely, self, taught, man, in, science, he, is, commonly, known, as, the, father, of, microbiology, and, one, of, the, first, microscopists, and, microbiologists, van, leeuwenhoek, is, best, known, for, his, pioneering, work, in, microscopy, and, for, his, contributions, toward, the, establishment, of, microbiology, as, a, scientific, discipline, raised, in, delft, dutch, republic, van, leeuwenhoek, worked, as, a, draper, in, his, youth, and, founded, his, own, shop, in, 1654, he, became, well, recognized, in, municipal, politics, and, developed, an, interest, in, lensmaking, in, the, 1670s, he, started, to, explore, microbial, life, with, his, microscope, using, single, lensed, microscopes, of, his, own, design, and, make, van, leeuwenhoek, was, the, first, to, observe, and, to, experiment, with, microbes, which, he, originally, referred, to, as, dierkens, diertgens, or, diertjes, he, was, the, first, to, relatively, determine, their, size, most, of, the, animalcules, are, now, referred, to, as, unicellular, organisms, although, he, observed, multicellular, organisms, in, pond, water, he, was, also, the, first, to, document, microscopic, observations, of, muscle, fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa, red, blood, cells, crystals, in, gouty, tophi, and, among, the, first, to, see, blood, flow, in, capillaries, although, van, leeuwenhoek, did, not, write, any, books, he, described, his, discoveries, in, chaotic, letters, to, the, royal, society, which, published, many, of, his, letters, in, their, philosophical, transactions, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, was, born, in, delft, dutch, republic, on, 24, october, 1632, on, 4, november, he, was, baptized, as, thonis, his, father, philips, antonisz, van, leeuwenhoek, was, a, basket, maker, who, died, when, antonie, was, only, five, years, old, his, mother, margaretha, bel, van, den, berch, came, from, a, well, to, do, brewer, s, family, she, remarried, jacob, jansz, molijn, a, painter, and, the, family, moved, to, warmond, around, 1640, antonie, had, four, older, sisters, margriet, geertruyt, neeltje, and, catharina, when, he, was, around, ten, years, old, his, step, father, died, he, was, sent, to, live, in, benthuizen, with, his, uncle, an, attorney, at, the, age, of, 16, he, became, a, bookkeeper, s, apprentice, casher, at, a, linen, draper, s, shop, at, warmoesstraat, in, amsterdam, which, was, owned, by, william, davidson, van, leeuwenhoek, left, there, after, six, years, in, july, 1654, van, leeuwenhoek, married, barbara, de, mey, in, delft, with, whom, he, fathered, one, surviving, daughter, maria, four, other, children, died, in, infancy, he, would, live, and, study, for, the, rest, of, his, life, at, hypolytusbuurt, in, a, house, he, bought, in, 1655, he, opened, a, draper, s, shop, selling, linen, yarn, and, ribbon, to, seamstresses, and, tailors, his, status, in, delft, grew, throughout, the, years, in, 1660, he, received, a, lucrative, job, as, chamberlain, for, the, sheriffs, in, the, city, hall, a, position, which, he, would, hold, for, almost, 40, years, his, duties, included, maintaining, the, premises, heating, cleaning, opening, for, meetings, performing, duties, for, those, assembled, and, maintaining, silence, on, all, matters, discussed, there, in, 1669, he, was, appointed, as, a, land, surveyor, by, the, court, of, holland, at, some, time, he, combined, it, with, another, municipal, job, being, the, official, wine, gauger, of, delft, and, in, charge, of, the, city, wine, imports, and, taxation, his, wife, had, died, in, 1666, and, in, 1671, van, leeuwenhoek, remarried, to, cornelia, swalmius, with, whom, he, had, no, children, van, leeuwenhoek, was, a, contemporary, of, another, famous, delft, citizen, the, painter, johannes, vermeer, who, was, baptized, just, four, days, earlier, it, has, been, suggested, that, he, is, the, man, portrayed, in, two, vermeer, paintings, of, the, late, 1660s, the, astronomer, and, the, geographer, but, others, argue, that, there, appears, to, be, little, physical, similarity, because, they, were, both, relatively, important, men, in, a, city, with, only, 24, 000, inhabitants, living, both, close, to, the, main, market, it, is, likely, they, knew, each, other, van, leeuwenhoek, acted, as, the, executor, of, vermeer, s, will, when, the, painter, died, in, 1675, van, leeuwenhoek, s, religion, was, dutch, reformed, and, calvinist, like, jan, swammerdam, he, often, referred, with, reverence, to, the, wonders, god, designed, in, making, creatures, great, and, small, and, believed, that, his, discoveries, were, merely, further, proof, of, the, wonder, of, creation, while, running, his, draper, shop, van, leeuwenhoek, wanted, to, see, the, quality, of, the, thread, better, than, what, was, possible, using, the, magnifying, lenses, of, the, time, he, developed, an, interest, in, lensmaking, although, few, records, exist, of, his, early, activity, by, placing, the, middle, of, a, small, rod, of, soda, lime, glass, in, a, hot, flame, one, can, pull, the, hot, section, apart, to, create, two, long, whiskers, of, glass, then, by, reinserting, the, end, of, one, whisker, into, the, flame, a, very, small, high, quality, glass, lens, is, created, significantly, a, may, 2021, neutron, tomography, study, of, a, high, magnification, leeuwenhoek, microscope, captured, images, of, the, short, glass, stem, characteristic, of, this, lens, creation, method, for, lower, magnifications, he, also, made, ground, lenses, to, help, keep, his, methods, confidential, he, apparently, intentionally, encouraged, others, to, think, grinding, was, his, primary, or, only, lens, construction, method, after, developing, his, method, for, creating, powerful, lenses, and, applying, them, to, the, study, of, the, microscopic, world, van, leeuwenhoek, introduced, his, work, to, his, friend, the, prominent, dutch, physician, reinier, de, graaf, when, the, royal, society, in, london, published, the, groundbreaking, work, of, an, italian, lensmaker, in, their, journal, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, de, graaf, wrote, to, the, editor, of, the, journal, henry, oldenburg, with, a, ringing, endorsement, of, van, leeuwenhoek, s, microscopes, which, he, claimed, far, surpass, those, which, we, have, hitherto, seen, in, response, in, 1673, the, society, published, a, letter, from, van, leeuwenhoek, that, included, his, microscopic, observations, on, mold, bees, and, lice, then, in, 1674, van, leeuwenhoek, made, his, most, significant, discovery, starting, from, the, assumption, that, life, and, motility, are, similar, he, determined, that, the, moving, objects, observed, under, his, microscope, were, little, animals, he, later, recorded, his, observations, in, his, diary, van, leeuwenhoek, s, work, fully, captured, the, attention, of, the, royal, society, and, he, began, corresponding, regularly, with, the, society, regarding, his, observations, at, first, he, had, been, reluctant, to, publicize, his, findings, regarding, himself, as, a, businessman, with, little, scientific, artistic, or, writing, background, but, de, graaf, urged, him, to, be, more, confident, in, his, work, by, the, time, van, leeuwenhoek, died, in, 1723, he, had, written, some, 190, letters, to, the, royal, society, detailing, his, findings, in, a, wide, variety, of, fields, centered, on, his, work, in, microscopy, he, only, wrote, letters, in, his, own, colloquial, dutch, he, never, published, a, proper, scientific, paper, in, latin, he, strongly, preferred, to, work, alone, distrusting, the, sincerity, of, those, who, offered, their, assistance, the, letters, were, translated, into, latin, or, english, by, henry, oldenburg, who, had, learned, dutch, for, this, very, purpose, he, was, also, the, first, to, use, the, word, animalcules, to, translate, the, dutch, words, that, leeuwenhoek, used, to, describe, microorganisms, despite, the, initial, success, of, van, leeuwenhoek, s, relationship, with, the, royal, society, soon, relations, became, severely, strained, his, credibility, was, questioned, when, he, sent, the, royal, society, a, copy, of, his, first, observations, of, microscopic, single, celled, organisms, dated, 9, october, 1676, previously, the, existence, of, single, celled, organisms, was, entirely, unknown, thus, even, with, his, established, reputation, with, the, royal, society, as, a, reliable, observer, his, observations, of, microscopic, life, were, initially, met, with, some, skepticism, eventually, in, the, face, of, van, leeuwenhoek, s, insistence, the, royal, society, arranged, for, alexander, petrie, minister, to, the, english, reformed, church, in, delft, benedict, haan, at, that, time, lutheran, minister, at, delft, and, henrik, cordes, then, lutheran, minister, at, the, hague, accompanied, by, sir, robert, gordon, and, four, others, to, determine, whether, it, was, in, fact, van, leeuwenhoek, s, ability, to, observe, and, reason, clearly, or, perhaps, the, royal, society, s, theories, of, life, that, might, require, reform, finally, in, 1677, van, leeuwenhoek, s, observations, were, fully, acknowledged, by, the, royal, society, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, was, elected, to, the, royal, society, in, february, 1680, on, the, nomination, of, william, croone, a, then, prominent, physician, van, leeuwenhoek, was, taken, aback, by, the, nomination, which, he, considered, a, high, honour, although, he, did, not, attend, the, induction, ceremony, in, london, nor, did, he, ever, attend, a, royal, society, meeting, he, had, his, portrait, painted, by, jan, verkolje, with, the, certificate, signed, by, james, ii, of, england, on, the, table, beside, him, by, the, end, of, the, seventeenth, century, van, leeuwenhoek, had, a, virtual, monopoly, on, microscopic, study, and, discovery, his, contemporary, robert, hooke, an, early, microscope, pioneer, bemoaned, that, the, field, had, come, to, rest, entirely, on, one, man, s, shoulders, in, 1673, his, first, letter, was, published, in, the, journal, of, the, royal, society, of, london, he, was, visited, over, the, years, by, many, notable, individuals, who, gazed, at, the, tiny, creatures, one, of, the, first, was, jan, swammerdam, around, 1675, it, was, johan, huydecoper, who, was, very, interested, in, collecting, and, growing, plants, for, his, estate, goudestein, becoming, in, 1682, manager, of, the, hortus, botanicus, amsterdam, christiaan, huygens, leibniz, 1676, john, locke, 1678, 1685, james, ii, of, england, 1679, william, iii, of, orange, mary, ii, of, england, and, thomas, molyneux, in, 1685, visited, in, october, 1697, van, leeuwenhoek, visited, the, tsar, peter, the, great, on, his, boat, moored, in, the, schie, or, the, arsenaal, on, this, occasion, he, presented, the, tsar, with, an, eel, viewer, so, peter, could, study, blood, circulation, whenever, he, wanted, in, 1706, it, was, govert, bidloo, in, 1714, richard, bradley, botanist, and, in, 1716, herman, boerhaave, and, frederik, ruysch, to, the, disappointment, of, his, guests, van, leeuwenhoek, refused, to, reveal, the, cutting, edge, microscopes, he, relied, on, for, his, discoveries, instead, showing, visitors, a, collection, of, average, quality, lenses, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, made, more, than, 500, optical, lenses, he, also, created, at, least, 25, single, lens, microscopes, of, differing, types, of, which, only, nine, have, survived, these, microscopes, were, made, of, silver, or, copper, frames, holding, hand, made, lenses, those, that, have, survived, are, capable, of, magnification, up, to, 275, times, it, is, suspected, that, van, leeuwenhoek, possessed, some, microscopes, that, could, magnify, up, to, 500, times, although, he, has, been, widely, regarded, as, a, dilettante, or, amateur, his, scientific, research, was, of, remarkably, high, quality, the, single, lens, microscopes, of, van, leeuwenhoek, were, relatively, small, devices, the, largest, being, about, 5, cm, long, they, are, used, by, placing, the, lens, very, close, in, front, of, the, eye, the, other, side, of, the, microscope, had, a, pin, where, the, sample, was, attached, in, order, to, stay, close, to, the, lens, there, were, also, three, screws, to, move, the, pin, and, the, sample, along, three, axes, one, axis, to, change, the, focus, and, the, two, other, axes, to, navigate, through, the, sample, van, leeuwenhoek, maintained, throughout, his, life, that, there, are, aspects, of, microscope, construction, which, i, only, keep, for, myself, in, particular, his, most, critical, secret, of, how, he, made, the, lenses, for, many, years, no, one, was, able, to, reconstruct, van, leeuwenhoek, s, design, techniques, but, in, 1957, c, l, stong, used, thin, glass, thread, fusing, instead, of, polishing, and, successfully, created, some, working, samples, of, a, van, leeuwenhoek, design, microscope, such, a, method, was, also, discovered, independently, by, a, mosolov, and, a, belkin, at, the, russian, novosibirsk, state, medical, institute, in, may, 2021, researchers, in, the, netherlands, published, a, non, destructive, neutron, tomography, study, of, a, leeuwenhoek, microscope, one, image, in, particular, shows, a, stong, mosolov, type, spherical, lens, with, a, single, short, glass, stem, attached, fig, 4, such, lenses, are, created, by, pulling, an, extremely, thin, glass, filament, breaking, the, filament, and, briefly, fusing, the, filament, end, the, nuclear, tomography, article, notes, this, lens, creation, method, was, first, devised, by, robert, hooke, rather, than, leeuwenhoek, which, is, ironic, given, hooke, s, subsequent, surprise, at, leeuwenhoek, s, findings, van, leeuwenhoek, used, samples, and, measurements, to, estimate, numbers, of, microorganisms, in, units, of, water, he, also, made, good, use, of, the, huge, advantage, provided, by, his, method, he, studied, a, broad, range, of, microscopic, phenomena, and, shared, the, resulting, observations, freely, with, groups, such, as, the, british, royal, society, such, work, firmly, established, his, place, in, history, as, one, of, the, first, and, most, important, explorers, of, the, microscopic, world, van, leeuwenhoek, was, one, of, the, first, people, to, observe, cells, much, like, robert, hooke, he, also, corresponded, with, antonio, magliabechi, like, robert, boyle, and, nicolaas, hartsoeker, van, leeuwenhoek, was, interested, in, dried, cochineal, trying, to, find, out, if, the, dye, came, from, a, berry, or, an, insect, he, studied, rainwater, the, seeds, of, oranges, worms, in, sheep, s, liver, the, eye, of, a, whale, the, blood, of, fishes, mites, coccinellidae, the, skin, of, elephants, celandine, and, cinchona, by, the, end, of, his, life, van, leeuwenhoek, had, written, approximately, 560, letters, to, the, royal, society, and, other, scientific, institutions, concerning, his, observations, and, discoveries, even, during, the, last, weeks, of, his, life, van, leeuwenhoek, continued, to, send, letters, full, of, observations, to, london, the, last, few, contained, a, precise, description, of, his, own, illness, he, suffered, from, a, rare, disease, an, uncontrolled, movement, of, the, midriff, which, now, is, named, van, leeuwenhoek, s, disease, he, died, at, the, age, of, 90, on, 26, august, 1723, and, was, buried, four, days, later, in, the, oude, kerk, in, delft, in, 1981, the, british, microscopist, brian, j, ford, found, that, van, leeuwenhoek, s, original, specimens, had, survived, in, the, collections, of, the, royal, society, of, london, they, were, found, to, be, of, high, quality, and, all, were, well, preserved, ford, carried, out, observations, with, a, range, of, single, lens, microscopes, adding, to, our, knowledge, of, van, leeuwenhoek, s, work, in, ford, s, opinion, leeuwenhoek, remained, imperfectly, understood, the, popular, view, that, his, work, was, crude, and, undisciplined, at, odds, with, the, evidence, of, conscientious, and, painstaking, observation, he, constructed, rational, and, repeatable, experimental, procedures, and, was, willing, to, oppose, received, opinion, such, as, spontaneous, generation, and, he, changed, his, mind, in, the, light, of, evidence, on, his, importance, in, the, history, of, microbiology, and, science, in, general, the, british, biochemist, nick, lane, wrote, that, he, was, the, first, even, to, think, of, looking, certainly, the, first, with, the, power, to, see, his, experiments, were, ingenious, and, he, was, a, scientist, of, the, highest, calibre, attacked, by, people, who, envied, him, or, scorned, his, unschooled, origins, not, helped, by, his, secrecy, about, his, methods, the, antoni, van, leeuwenhoek, hospital, in, amsterdam, named, after, van, leeuwenhoek, is, specialized, in, oncology, in, 2004, a, public, poll, in, the, netherlands, to, determine, the, greatest, dutchman, de, grootste, nederlander, named, van, leeuwenhoek, the, 4th, greatest, dutchman, of, all, time, on, 24, october, 2016, google, commemorated, the, 384th, anniversary, of, van, leeuwenhoek, s, birth, with, a, doodle, that, depicted, his, discovery, of, little, animals, or, animalcules, now, known, as, unicellular, organisms, the, leeuwenhoek, medal, leeuwenhoek, lecture, leeuwenhoek, crater, leeuwenhoeckia, levenhookia, a, genus, in, the, family, stylidiaceae, leeuwenhoekiella, an, aerobic, bacterial, genus, and, the, scientific, publication, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, international, journal, of, general, and, molecular, microbiology, are, named, after, him
