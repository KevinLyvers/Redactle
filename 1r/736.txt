seneca, was, forced, to, take, his, own, life, for, alleged, complicity, in, the, pisonian, conspiracy, to, assassinate, nero, of, which, he, was, probably, innocent, his, stoic, and, calm, suicide,

brothers, the, others, were, lucius, annaeus, novatus, later, known, as, junius, gallio, and, annaeus, mela, the, father, of, the, poet, lucan, miriam, griffin, says, in, her, biography, of, seneca, that, the, evidence, for, seneca, s, life, before, his, exile, in, 41, is, so, slight, and, the, potential, interest, of, these, years, for, social, history, as, well, as, for, biography, is, so, great, that, few, writers, on, seneca, have, resisted, the, temptation, to, eke, out, knowledge, with, imagination, griffin, also, infers, from, the, ancient, sources, that, seneca, was, born, in, either, 8, 4, or, 1, bc, she, thinks, he, was, born, between, 4, and, 1, bc, and, was, resident, in, rome, by, ad, 5, seneca, is, said, to, have, been, taken, to, rome, in, the, arms, of, his, aunt, his, mother, s, stepsister, at, a, young, age, probably, when, he, was, about, five, years, old, his, father, resided, for, much, of, his, life, in, the, city, seneca, was, taught, the, usual, subjects, of, literature, grammar, and, rhetoric, as, part, of, the, standard, education, of, high, born, romans, while, still, young, he, received, philosophical, training, from, attalus, the, stoic, and, from, sotion, and, papirius, fabianus, both, of, whom, belonged, to, the, short, lived, school, of, the, sextii, which, combined, stoicism, with, pythagoreanism, sotion, persuaded, seneca, when, he, was, a, young, man, in, his, early, twenties, to, become, a, vegetarian, which, he, practiced, for, around, a, year, before, his, father, urged, him, to, desist, because, the, practice, was, associated, with, some, foreign, rites, seneca, often, had, breathing, difficulties, throughout, his, life, probably, asthma, and, at, some, point, in, his, mid, twenties, c, ad, 20, he, appears, to, have, been, struck, down, with, tuberculosis, he, was, sent, to, egypt, to, live, with, his, aunt, the, same, aunt, who, had, brought, him, to, rome, whose, husband, gaius, galerius, had, become, prefect, of, egypt, she, nursed, him, through, a, period, of, ill, health, that, lasted, up, to, ten, years, in, 31, ad, he, returned, to, rome, with, his, aunt, his, uncle, dying, en, route, in, a, shipwreck, his, aunt, s, influence, helped, seneca, be, elected, quaestor, probably, after, ad, 37, which, also, earned, him, the, right, to, sit, in, the, roman, senate, seneca, s, early, career, as, a, senator, seems, to, have, been, successful, and, he, was, praised, for, his, oratory, in, his, writings, seneca, has, nothing, good, to, say, about, caligula, and, frequently, depicts, him, as, a, monster, cassius, dio, relates, a, story, that, caligula, was, so, offended, by, seneca, s, oratorical, success, in, the, senate, that, he, ordered, him, to, commit, suicide, seneca, survived, only, because, he, was, seriously, ill, and, caligula, was, told, that, he, would, soon, die, anyway, seneca, explains, his, own, survival, as, due, to, his, patience, and, his, devotion, to, his, friends, i, wanted, to, avoid, the, impression, that, all, i, could, do, for, loyalty, was, die, in, ad, 41, claudius, became, emperor, and, seneca, was, accused, by, the, new, empress, messalina, of, adultery, with, julia, livilla, sister, to, caligula, and, agrippina, the, affair, has, been, doubted, by, some, historians, since, messalina, had, clear, political, motives, for, getting, rid, of, julia, livilla, and, her, supporters, the, senate, pronounced, a, death, sentence, on, seneca, which, claudius, commuted, to, exile, and, seneca, spent, the, next, eight, years, on, the, island, of, corsica, two, of, seneca, s, earliest, surviving, works, date, from, the, period, of, his, exile, both, consolations, in, his, consolation, to, helvia, his, mother, seneca, comforts, her, as, a, bereaved, mother, for, losing, her, son, to, exile, seneca, incidentally, mentions, the, death, of, his, only, son, a, few, weeks, before, his, exile, later, in, life, seneca, was, married, to, a, woman, younger, than, himself, pompeia, paulina, it, has, been, thought, that, the, infant, son, may, have, been, from, an, earlier, marriage, but, the, evidence, is, tenuous, seneca, s, other, work, of, this, period, his, consolation, to, polybius, one, of, claudius, freedmen, focused, on, consoling, polybius, on, the, death, of, his, brother, it, is, noted, for, its, flattery, of, claudius, and, seneca, expresses, his, hope, that, the, emperor, will, recall, him, from, exile, in, 49, ad, agrippina, married, her, uncle, claudius, and, through, her, influence, seneca, was, recalled, to, rome, agrippina, gained, the, praetorship, for, seneca, and, appointed, him, tutor, to, her, son, the, future, emperor, nero, from, ad, 54, to, 62, seneca, acted, as, nero, s, advisor, together, with, the, praetorian, prefect, sextus, afranius, burrus, early, in, nero, s, reign, his, mother, agrippina, exercised, his, authority, to, make, decisions, seneca, and, burrus, opposed, this, authoritarian, matriarchy, which, had, become, the, cause, of, irresponsibility, of, the, emperor, one, by, product, of, his, new, position, was, that, seneca, was, appointed, suffect, consul, in, 56, seneca, s, influence, was, said, to, have, been, especially, strong, in, the, first, year, seneca, composed, nero, s, accession, speeches, in, which, he, promised, to, restore, proper, legal, procedure, and, authority, to, the, senate, he, also, composed, the, eulogy, for, claudius, that, nero, delivered, at, the, funeral, seneca, s, satirical, skit, apocolocyntosis, which, lampoons, the, deification, of, claudius, and, praises, nero, dates, from, the, earliest, period, of, nero, s, reign, in, ad, 55, seneca, wrote, on, clemency, following, nero, s, murder, of, britannicus, perhaps, to, assure, the, citizenry, that, the, murder, was, the, end, not, the, beginning, of, bloodshed, on, clemency, is, a, work, which, although, it, flatters, nero, was, intended, to, show, the, correct, stoic, path, of, virtue, for, a, ruler, tacitus, and, dio, suggest, that, nero, s, early, rule, during, which, he, listened, to, seneca, and, burrus, was, quite, competent, however, the, ancient, sources, suggest, that, over, time, seneca, and, burrus, lost, their, influence, over, the, emperor, in, 59, they, had, reluctantly, agreed, to, agrippina, s, murder, and, afterward, tacitus, reports, that, seneca, had, to, write, a, letter, justifying, the, murder, to, the, senate, in, ad, 58, the, senator, publius, suillius, rufus, made, a, series, of, public, attacks, on, seneca, these, attacks, reported, by, tacitus, and, cassius, dio, included, charges, that, in, a, mere, four, years, of, service, to, nero, seneca, had, acquired, a, vast, personal, fortune, of, three, hundred, million, sestertii, by, charging, high, interest, on, loans, throughout, italy, and, the, provinces, suillius, attacks, included, claims, of, sexual, corruption, with, a, suggestion, that, seneca, had, slept, with, agrippina, tacitus, though, reports, that, suillius, was, highly, prejudiced, he, had, been, a, favorite, of, claudius, and, had, been, an, embezzler, and, informant, in, response, seneca, brought, a, series, of, prosecutions, for, corruption, against, suillius, half, of, his, estate, was, confiscated, and, he, was, sent, into, exile, however, the, attacks, reflect, a, criticism, of, seneca, that, was, made, at, the, time, and, continued, through, later, ages, seneca, was, undoubtedly, extremely, rich, he, had, properties, at, baiae, and, nomentum, an, alban, villa, and, egyptian, estates, cassius, dio, even, reports, that, the, boudica, uprising, in, britannia, was, caused, by, seneca, forcing, large, loans, on, the, indigenous, british, aristocracy, in, the, aftermath, of, claudius, s, conquest, of, britain, and, then, calling, them, in, suddenly, and, aggressively, seneca, was, sensitive, to, such, accusations, his, de, vita, beata, on, the, happy, life, dates, from, around, this, time, and, includes, a, defense, of, wealth, along, stoic, lines, arguing, that, properly, gaining, and, spending, wealth, is, appropriate, behavior, for, a, philosopher, after, burrus, s, death, in, 62, seneca, s, influence, declined, rapidly, as, tacitus, puts, it, ann, 14, 52, 1, mors, burri, infregit, senecae, potentiam, the, death, of, burrus, broke, seneca, s, power, tacitus, reports, that, seneca, tried, to, retire, twice, in, 62, and, ad, 64, but, nero, refused, him, on, both, occasions, nevertheless, seneca, was, increasingly, absent, from, the, court, he, adopted, a, quiet, lifestyle, on, his, country, estates, concentrating, on, his, studies, and, seldom, visiting, rome, it, was, during, these, final, few, years, that, he, composed, two, of, his, greatest, works, naturales, quaestiones, an, encyclopedia, of, the, natural, world, and, his, letters, to, lucilius, which, document, his, philosophical, thoughts, in, ad, 65, seneca, was, caught, up, in, the, aftermath, of, the, pisonian, conspiracy, a, plot, to, kill, nero, although, it, is, unlikely, that, seneca, was, part, of, the, conspiracy, nero, ordered, him, to, kill, himself, seneca, followed, tradition, by, severing, several, veins, in, order, to, bleed, to, death, and, his, wife, pompeia, paulina, attempted, to, share, his, fate, cassius, dio, who, wished, to, emphasize, the, relentlessness, of, nero, focused, on, how, seneca, had, attended, to, his, last, minute, letters, and, how, his, death, was, hastened, by, soldiers, a, generation, after, the, julio, claudian, emperors, tacitus, wrote, an, account, of, the, suicide, which, in, view, of, his, republican, sympathies, is, perhaps, somewhat, romanticized, according, to, this, account, nero, ordered, seneca, s, wife, saved, her, wounds, were, bound, up, and, she, made, no, further, attempt, to, kill, herself, as, for, seneca, himself, his, age, and, diet, were, blamed, for, slow, loss, of, blood, and, extended, pain, rather, than, a, quick, death, he, also, took, poison, which, was, not, fatal, after, dictating, his, last, words, to, a, scribe, and, with, a, circle, of, friends, attending, him, in, his, home, he, immersed, himself, in, a, warm, bath, which, he, expected, would, speed, blood, flow, and, ease, his, pain, tacitus, wrote, he, was, then, carried, into, a, bath, with, the, steam, of, which, he, was, suffocated, and, he, was, burnt, without, any, of, the, usual, funeral, rites, so, he, had, directed, in, a, codicil, of, his, will, even, when, in, the, height, of, his, wealth, and, power, he, was, thinking, of, life, s, close, this, may, give, the, impression, of, a, favorable, portrait, of, seneca, but, tacitus, s, treatment, of, him, is, at, best, ambivalent, alongside, seneca, s, apparent, fortitude, in, the, face, of, death, for, example, one, can, also, view, his, actions, as, rather, histrionic, and, performative, and, when, tacitus, tells, us, that, he, left, his, family, an, imago, suae, vitae, annales, 15, 62, an, image, of, his, life, he, is, possibly, being, ambiguous, in, roman, culture, the, imago, was, a, kind, of, mask, that, commemorated, the, great, ancestors, of, noble, families, but, at, the, same, time, it, may, also, suggest, duplicity, superficiality, and, pretense, as, a, major, philosophical, figure, of, the, roman, imperial, period, seneca, s, lasting, contribution, to, philosophy, has, been, to, the, school, of, stoicism, his, writing, is, highly, accessible, and, was, the, subject, of, attention, from, the, renaissance, onwards, by, writers, such, as, michel, de, montaigne, he, has, been, described, as, a, towering, and, controversial, figure, of, antiquity, and, the, world, s, most, interesting, stoic, seneca, wrote, a, number, of, books, on, stoicism, mostly, on, ethics, with, one, work, naturales, quaestiones, on, the, physical, world, seneca, built, on, the, writings, of, many, of, the, earlier, stoics, he, often, mentions, zeno, cleanthes, and, chrysippus, and, frequently, cites, posidonius, with, whom, seneca, shared, an, interest, in, natural, phenomena, he, frequently, quotes, epicurus, especially, in, his, letters, his, interest, in, epicurus, is, mainly, limited, to, using, him, as, a, source, of, ethical, maxims, likewise, seneca, shows, some, interest, in, platonist, metaphysics, but, never, with, any, clear, commitment, his, moral, essays, are, based, on, stoic, doctrines, stoicism, was, a, popular, philosophy, in, this, period, and, many, upper, class, romans, found, in, it, a, guiding, ethical, framework, for, political, involvement, it, was, once, popular, to, regard, seneca, as, being, very, eclectic, in, his, stoicism, but, modern, scholarship, views, him, as, a, fairly, orthodox, stoic, albeit, a, free, minded, one, his, works, discuss, both, ethical, theory, and, practical, advice, and, seneca, stresses, that, both, parts, are, distinct, but, interdependent, his, letters, to, lucilius, showcase, seneca, s, search, for, ethical, perfection, and, represent, a, sort, of, philosophical, testament, for, posterity, seneca, regards, philosophy, as, a, balm, for, the, wounds, of, life, the, destructive, passions, especially, anger, and, grief, must, be, uprooted, or, moderated, according, to, reason, he, discusses, the, relative, merits, of, the, contemplative, life, and, the, active, life, and, he, considers, it, important, to, confront, one, s, own, mortality, and, be, able, to, face, death, one, must, be, willing, to, practice, poverty, and, use, wealth, properly, and, he, writes, about, favours, clemency, the, importance, of, friendship, and, the, need, to, benefit, others, the, universe, is, governed, for, the, best, by, a, rational, providence, and, this, must, be, reconciled, with, acceptance, of, adversity, ten, plays, are, attributed, to, seneca, of, which, most, likely, eight, were, written, by, him, the, plays, stand, in, stark, contrast, to, his, philosophical, works, with, their, intense, emotions, and, grim, overall, tone, the, plays, seem, to, represent, the, antithesis, of, seneca, s, stoic, beliefs, up, to, the, 16th, century, it, was, normal, to, distinguish, between, seneca, the, moral, philosopher, and, seneca, the, dramatist, as, two, separate, people, scholars, have, tried, to, spot, certain, stoic, themes, it, is, the, uncontrolled, passions, that, generate, madness, ruination, and, self, destruction, this, has, a, cosmic, as, well, as, an, ethical, aspect, and, fate, is, a, powerful, albeit, rather, oppressive, force, many, scholars, have, thought, following, the, ideas, of, the, 19th, century, german, scholar, friedrich, leo, that, seneca, s, tragedies, were, written, for, recitation, only, other, scholars, think, that, they, were, written, for, performance, and, that, it, is, possible, that, actual, performance, took, place, in, seneca, s, lifetime, ultimately, this, issue, cannot, be, resolved, on, the, basis, of, our, existing, knowledge, the, tragedies, of, seneca, have, been, successfully, staged, in, modern, times, the, dating, of, the, tragedies, is, highly, problematic, in, the, absence, of, any, ancient, references, a, parody, of, a, lament, from, hercules, furens, appears, in, the, apocolocyntosis, which, implies, a, date, before, ad, 54, for, that, play, a, relative, chronology, has, been, proposed, on, metrical, grounds, the, plays, are, not, all, based, on, the, greek, pattern, they, have, a, five, act, form, and, differ, in, many, respects, from, extant, attic, drama, and, while, the, influence, of, euripides, on, some, of, these, works, is, considerable, so, is, the, influence, of, virgil, and, ovid, seneca, s, plays, were, widely, read, in, medieval, and, renaissance, european, universities, and, strongly, influenced, tragic, drama, in, that, time, such, as, elizabethan, england, william, shakespeare, and, other, playwrights, france, corneille, and, racine, and, the, netherlands, joost, van, den, vondel, english, translations, of, seneca, s, tragedies, appeared, in, print, in, the, mid, 16th, century, with, all, ten, published, collectively, in, 1581, he, is, regarded, as, the, source, and, inspiration, for, what, is, known, as, revenge, tragedy, starting, with, thomas, kyd, s, the, spanish, tragedy, and, continuing, well, into, the, jacobean, era, thyestes, is, considered, seneca, s, masterpiece, and, has, been, described, by, scholar, dana, gioia, as, one, of, the, most, influential, plays, ever, written, medea, is, also, highly, regarded, and, was, praised, along, with, phaedra, by, t, s, eliot, works, attributed, to, seneca, include, 12, philosophical, essays, 124, letters, dealing, with, moral, issues, nine, tragedies, and, a, satire, the, attribution, of, which, is, disputed, his, authorship, of, hercules, on, oeta, has, also, been, questioned, fabulae, crepidatae, tragedies, with, greek, subjects, fabula, praetexta, tragedy, in, roman, setting, traditionally, given, in, the, following, order, seneca, s, writings, were, well, known, in, the, later, roman, period, and, quintilian, writing, thirty, years, after, seneca, s, death, remarked, on, the, popularity, of, his, works, amongst, the, youth, while, he, found, much, to, admire, quintillian, criticized, seneca, for, what, he, regarded, as, a, degenerate, literary, style, a, criticism, echoed, by, aulus, gellius, in, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, century, the, early, christian, church, was, very, favourably, disposed, towards, seneca, and, his, writings, and, the, church, leader, tertullian, possessively, referred, to, him, as, our, seneca, by, the, 4th, century, an, apocryphal, correspondence, with, paul, the, apostle, had, been, created, linking, seneca, into, the, christian, tradition, the, letters, are, mentioned, by, jerome, who, also, included, seneca, among, a, list, of, christian, writers, and, seneca, is, similarly, mentioned, by, augustine, in, the, 6th, century, martin, of, braga, synthesized, seneca, s, thought, into, a, couple, of, treatises, that, became, popular, in, their, own, right, otherwise, seneca, was, mainly, known, through, a, large, number, of, quotes, and, extracts, in, the, florilegia, which, were, popular, throughout, the, medieval, period, when, his, writings, were, read, in, the, later, middle, ages, it, was, mostly, his, letters, to, lucilius, the, longer, essays, and, plays, being, relatively, unknown, medieval, writers, and, works, continued, to, link, him, to, christianity, because, of, his, alleged, association, with, paul, the, golden, legend, a, 13th, century, hagiographical, account, of, famous, saints, that, was, widely, read, included, an, account, of, seneca, s, death, scene, and, erroneously, presented, nero, as, a, witness, to, seneca, s, suicide, dante, placed, seneca, alongside, cicero, among, the, great, spirits, in, the, first, circle, of, hell, or, limbo, boccaccio, who, in, 1370, came, across, the, works, of, tacitus, whilst, browsing, the, library, at, montecassino, wrote, an, account, of, seneca, s, suicide, hinting, that, it, was, a, kind, of, disguised, baptism, or, a, de, facto, baptism, in, spirit, some, such, as, albertino, mussato, and, giovanni, colonna, went, even, further, and, concluded, that, seneca, must, have, been, a, christian, convert, various, other, antique, and, medieval, texts, purport, to, be, by, seneca, e, g, de, remediis, fortuitorum, but, with, unconfirmed, authorship, they, have, sometimes, been, referred, to, as, pseudo, seneca, at, least, some, of, these, seem, to, preserve, and, adapt, genuine, senecan, content, for, example, saint, martin, of, braga, s, d, c, 580, formula, vitae, honestae, or, de, differentiis, quatuor, virtutum, vitae, honestae, rules, for, an, honest, life, or, on, the, four, cardinal, virtues, early, manuscripts, preserve, martin, s, preface, where, he, makes, it, clear, that, this, was, his, adaptation, but, in, later, copies, this, was, omitted, and, the, work, was, later, thought, fully, seneca, s, work, seneca, is, also, often, quoted, as, the, author, of, the, aphorism, religion, is, regarded, by, the, common, people, as, true, by, the, wise, as, false, and, by, the, rulers, as, useful, however, this, quote, is, similar, to, a, statement, by, edward, gibbon, the, various, modes, of, worship, which, prevailed, in, the, roman, world, were, all, considered, by, the, people, as, equally, true, by, the, philosophers, as, equally, false, and, by, the, magistrate, as, equally, useful, so, it, is, disputed, seneca, remains, one, of, the, few, popular, roman, philosophers, from, the, period, he, appears, not, only, in, dante, but, also, in, chaucer, and, to, a, large, degree, in, petrarch, who, adopted, his, style, in, his, own, essays, and, who, quotes, him, more, than, any, other, authority, except, virgil, in, the, renaissance, printed, editions, and, translations, of, his, works, became, common, including, an, edition, by, erasmus, and, a, commentary, by, john, calvin, john, of, salisbury, erasmus, and, others, celebrated, his, works, french, essayist, montaigne, who, gave, a, spirited, defense, of, seneca, and, plutarch, in, his, essays, was, himself, considered, by, pasquier, a, french, seneca, similarly, thomas, fuller, praised, joseph, hall, as, our, english, seneca, many, who, considered, his, ideas, not, particularly, original, still, argued, that, he, was, important, in, making, the, greek, philosophers, presentable, and, intelligible, his, suicide, has, also, been, a, popular, subject, in, art, from, jacques, louis, david, s, 1773, painting, the, death, of, seneca, to, the, 1951, film, quo, vadis, even, with, the, admiration, of, an, earlier, group, of, intellectual, stalwarts, seneca, has, never, been, without, his, detractors, in, his, own, time, he, was, accused, of, hypocrisy, or, at, least, a, less, than, stoic, lifestyle, while, banished, to, corsica, he, wrote, a, plea, for, restoration, rather, incompatible, with, his, advocacy, of, a, simple, life, and, the, acceptance, of, fate, in, his, apocolocyntosis, he, ridiculed, the, behaviors, and, policies, of, claudius, and, flattered, nero, such, as, proclaiming, that, nero, would, live, longer, and, be, wiser, than, the, legendary, nestor, the, claims, of, publius, suillius, rufus, that, seneca, acquired, some, three, hundred, million, sesterces, through, nero, s, favor, are, highly, partisan, but, they, reflect, the, reality, that, seneca, was, both, powerful, and, wealthy, robin, campbell, a, translator, of, seneca, s, letters, writes, that, the, stock, criticism, of, seneca, right, down, the,
