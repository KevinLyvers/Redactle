of, his, doubles, although, of, average, height, and, medium, build, 1, 73, m, 5, ft, 8, in, laver, developed, a, technically, complete, serve, and, volley, game, with, aggressive, groundstrokes, to, back, it, up, commentator, dan, maskell, described, him, as, technically, faultless, his, left, handed, serve, was, well, disguised, and, wide, swinging, his, groundstrokes, on, both, flanks, were, hit, with, topspin, as, was, the, attacking, topspin, lob, which, laver, developed, into, a, weapon, his, stroke, technique, was, based, on, quick, shoulder, turns, true, swings, and, accurate, timing, his, backhand, often, hit, on, the, run, was, a, point, ender, that, gave, him, an, advantage, laver, was, very, quick, and, had, a, strong, left, forearm, rex, bellamy, wrote, the, strength, of, that, wrist, and, forearm, gave, him, blazing, power, without, loss, of, control, even, when, he, was, on, the, run, and, at, full, stretch, the, combination, of, speed, and, strength, especially, wrist, strength, enabled, him, to, hit, ferocious, winners, when, way, out, of, court, at, the, net, he, had, forcing, volleys, often, hit, as, stroke, volleys, especially, on, the, backhand, he, could, hit, sharp, underspin, angles, as, well, he, was, difficult, to, lob, because, of, his, springing, agility, and, when, forced, to, retreat, he, could, come, up, with, a, vicious, counterpunch, as, an, amateur, laver, was, a, somewhat, flashy, player, often, a, late, starter, he, had, to, learn, to, control, his, adventurous, shot, making, and, integrate, percentage, tennis, into, his, game, when, he, turned, professional, in, his, prime, he, could, adapt, his, style, to, all, surfaces, and, to, all, conditions, laver, had, a, strong, record, in, five, set, matches, often, turning, things, around, with, subtle, changes, of, tactics, laver, is, regarded, by, many, as, the, greatest, tennis, player, in, the, history, of, the, sport, laver, was, ranked, the, world, no, 1, amateur, in, 1961, by, lance, tingay, and, in, 1962, by, tingay, and, ned, potter, laver, was, the, number, one, professional, in, some, rankings, in, 1964, in, all, rankings, from, 1965, to, 1969, and, in, some, rankings, in, 1970, jack, kramer, the, long, time, tennis, promoter, ranked, laver, only, in, the, second, echelon, of, great, players, just, behind, the, six, best, he, writes, that, although, laver, was, absolutely, unbeatable, for, a, year, or, two, late, in, the, 1960s, a, careful, comparison, could, be, made, between, laver, and, the, somewhat, older, gonzales, and, that, kramer, is, positive, that, gonzales, could, have, beaten, laver, regularly, kramer, s, main, argument, for, downgrading, laver, is, that, ken, rosewall, beat, laver, in, those, two, world, championship, of, tennis, finals, and, that, was, a, title, laver, really, wanted, kramer, sees, as, evidence, of, gonzales, superiority, over, laver, the, fact, that, gonzales, defeated, laver, in, a, five, set, match, before, 15, 000, spectators, in, new, york, city, s, madison, square, garden, in, january, 1970, when, gonzales, was, 41, years, old, and, laver, was, still, considered, the, world, no, 1, player, on, the, other, hand, gonzales, was, still, a, top, ten, player, when, this, match, took, place, and, laver, subsequently, won, this, event, beating, gonzales, in, a, straight, sets, semifinal, overall, his, head, to, head, record, with, gonzales, was, either, 35, 19, or, 38, 21, in, favour, of, laver, depending, on, the, source, laver, was, 12, 5, against, gonzales, during, the, open, era, although, gonzales, was, then, in, his, late, thirties, in, 1975, don, budge, ranked, his, top, five, players, of, all, time, and, rated, laver, number, five, behind, vines, kramer, perry, and, tilden, in, 1978, ellsworth, vines, ranked, his, all, time, top, 10, in, tennis, myth, and, method, and, rated, laver, number, four, behind, budge, kramer, and, gonzales, in, the, early, years, of, the, 21st, century, sidney, wood, compiled, his, list, of, the, greatest, players, of, all, time, later, published, posthumously, in, a, memoir, the, wimbledon, final, that, never, was, and, other, tennis, tales, from, a, bygone, era, wood, first, entered, wimbledon, in, 1927, and, won, the, title, in, 1931, from, that, time, on, through, to, the, late, 1970s, doubles, only, towards, the, end, i, was, privileged, to, compete, against, virtually, every, top, player, in, the, world, said, wood, wood, ranked, laver, number, five, behind, budge, kramer, tilden, and, gonzales, in, 2014, frank, sedgman, in, his, autobiography, game, sedge, and, match, ranked, laver, number, three, behind, jack, kramer, and, roger, federer, in, his, list, of, greatest, male, tennis, players, of, all, time, many, experts, disagree, with, kramer, s, assessment, of, laver, for, example, dan, maskell, john, barrett, butch, buchholz, cliff, drysdale, joe, mccauley, ted, schroeder, and, tony, trabert, rank, laver, as, the, best, of, all, time, schroeder, has, been, quoted, by, alan, trengove, as, saying, you, take, all, the, criteria, longevity, playing, on, grass, and, clay, amateur, professional, his, behaviour, his, appearance, in, all, criteria, laver, s, the, best, player, of, all, time, trabert, said, in, january, 2008, i, still, maintain, that, rod, laver, is, the, best, player, who, ever, played, the, game, because, he, s, done, something, no, one, has, ever, done, in, the, 120, or, 140, year, history, of, our, sport, he, won, the, grand, slam, as, an, amateur, and, he, won, the, grand, slam, as, a, pro, if, someone, in, some, other, sport, held, a, world, record, no, one, else, had, you, would, say, that, person, was, the, best, in, that, sport, so, in, my, view, you, ve, got, to, say, laver, is, the, best, player, of, all, time, similarly, the, tennis, author, peter, bodo, wrote, in, may, 2008, give, him, credit, shoot, the, only, real, issue, is, whether, the, goat, argument, is, a, debate, at, all, given, that, posting, those, two, slams, puts, laver, in, a, league, of, his, own, other, experts, cite, the, fact, that, during, his, amateur, touring, professional, and, open, era, careers, laver, won, a, record, 184, singles, titles, he, also, holds, the, record, for, most, titles, won, in, a, single, year, during, the, amateur, era, 22, in, 1962, during, the, touring, pro, era, 19, in, 1967, and, during, the, open, era, 18, in, 1969, after, turning, professional, in, 1963, laver, won, the, u, s, pro, tennis, championships, five, times, and, the, wembley, pro, championship, four, times, from, 1964, to, 1967, in, 1967, laver, won, a, professional, grand, slam, by, winning, all, four, of, the, major, professional, tournaments, the, us, pro, championships, the, wembley, pro, championships, the, french, pro, championship, and, the, wimbledon, pro, in, 1983, fred, perry, ranked, the, greatest, male, players, of, all, time, and, put, them, in, to, two, categories, before, world, war, 2, and, after, perry, ranked, laver, number, one, in, the, post, world, war, 2, list, laver, came, out, on, top, in, various, experts, polls, for, the, best, of, all, time, in, 1986, the, us, magazine, inside, tennis, polled, 37, experts, which, resulted, in, a, computerised, tournament, laver, ranked, first, on, this, list, ahead, of, john, mcenroe, don, budge, kramer, bj, rn, borg, gonzales, tilden, jimmy, connors, fred, perry, and, lew, hoad, in, a, poll, by, the, associated, press, in, 2000, laver, was, voted, the, male, tennis, player, of, the, century, ahead, of, pete, sampras, tilden, borg, budge, mcenroe, and, hoad, tied, rosewall, and, roy, emerson, tied, and, kramer, in, an, article, in, tennis, week, in, 2007, the, tennis, historian, raymond, lee, statistically, analysed, the, all, time, best, players, laver, topped, his, list, ahead, of, tilden, and, borg, tied, roger, federer, gonzales, rosewall, budge, ivan, lendl, connors, sampras, mcenroe, and, kramer, in, 2009, it, was, written, that, rod, laver, is, considered, by, most, folks, who, saw, him, play, and, many, who, ve, heard, of, his, accomplishments, to, be, as, great, a, tennis, player, that, ever, lived, current, players, included, in, july, 2017, tennis, player, roger, federer, called, rod, laver, the, greatest, of, all, time, in, 1989, bud, collins, wrote, i, remain, unconvinced, that, there, ever, was, a, better, player, than, rod, laver, thirteen, years, later, however, as, editor, of, the, total, tennis, the, ultimate, tennis, encyclopedia, collins, was, more, guarded, he, wrote, that, laver, would, be, known, as, possibly, the, greatest, player, ever, but, also, said, that, gonzales, was, probably, as, good, as, anyone, who, ever, played, the, game, if, not, better, and, called, tilden, perhaps, the, greatest, player, of, them, all, in, an, august, 2006, article, for, msnbc, collins, ranked, laver, as, one, of, the, five, top, men, s, tennis, stars, of, all, time, along, with, tilden, gonzales, borg, and, sampras, he, pointed, to, tilden, s, phenomenal, 938, winning, percentage, and, said, if, i, had, to, choose, someone, to, play, for, my, life, it, would, be, pancho, gonzalez, praised, borg, s, uncanny, transition, from, the, french, open, to, wimbledon, cited, sampras, s, assault, on, the, citadels, of, the, past, and, called, laver, in, my, eyes, the, greatest, player, ever, in, 1973, the, atp, s, computer, rankings, were, established, laver, attained, his, highest, ranking, on, that, computer, of, world, no, 3, in, 1974, laver, s, highest, year, end, ranking, by, the, atp, was, world, no, 4, in, 1974, laver, semi, retired, from, the, main, professional, tennis, tour, in, 1975, while, still, being, ranked, in, the, top, 10, in, terms, of, yearly, prize, money, won, laver, was, the, leader, from, 1964, until, 1971, the, number, of, tournament, singles, titles, that, laver, won, during, his, career, varies, depending, on, the, source, the, atp, credits, laver, with, 72, open, era, titles, while, total, tennis, the, ultimate, tennis, encyclopedia, edited, by, bud, collins, give, him, 47, or, 54, titles, during, the, open, era, collins, credits, him, with, 184, titles, in, amateur, professional, and, open, competition, without, listing, them, in, detail, laver, s, eleven, grand, slam, singles, titles, currently, place, him, tied, with, borg, for, sixth, place, on, the, all, time, list, among, his, contemporaries, only, emerson, won, more, grand, slam, singles, titles, during, his, career, 12, to, laver, s, 11, though, more, recently, federer, nadal, sampras, and, djokovic, have, surpassed, this, number, laver, also, won, eight, major, doubles, titles, laver, is, the, only, player, to, have, twice, won, all, four, grand, slam, singles, tournaments, during, the, same, calendar, year, the, australian, open, french, open, wimbledon, and, the, us, open, because, none, of, the, majors, were, played, on, hardcourts, in, laver, s, era, he, never, won, a, grand, slam, tournament, on, that, surface, the, tennis, landscape, today, is, different, as, half, of, the, year, s, majors, are, played, on, hardcourts, only, six, players, have, won, major, titles, on, clay, grass, and, hardcourts, jimmy, connors, mats, wilander, andre, agassi, roger, federer, rafael, nadal, and, novak, djokovic, federer, nadal, and, djokovic, are, the, only, players, in, history, to, have, simultaneously, held, grand, slam, tournament, titles, on, the, three, surfaces, previous, observations, change, substantially, if, we, also, consider, professional, grand, slam, majors, which, were, played, on, two, different, surfaces, in, the, 1963, 67, period, grass, and, wood, parquet, and, wherein, laver, like, rosewall, excelled, furthermore, the, atp, performance, zone, website, lists, his, partial, career, win, loss, percentage, on, hardcourt, as, 813, on, carpet, as, 766, on, grass, as, 827, and, on, clay, as, 764, laver, was, unable, to, compete, in, the, grand, slam, tournaments, during, his, professional, career, between, 1963, and, 1968, and, it, is, argued, he, would, likely, have, won, more, titles, had, he, been, able, to, do, so, sports, columnist, malcolm, knox, of, the, sydney, morning, herald, assesses, the, effect, of, laver, s, ban, on, competing, in, grand, slams, he, states, if, grand, slams, are, taken, as, the, benchmark, consider, this, laver, won, 11, of, the, 16, grand, slam, titles, he, contested, in, his, prime, the, pro, tour, put, him, out, of, 20, grand, slams, from, age, 23, to, 28, based, on, this, he, puts, laver, and, rosewall, in, a, class, of, two, in, 2000, the, centre, court, at, melbourne, park, which, today, hosts, the, australian, open,
