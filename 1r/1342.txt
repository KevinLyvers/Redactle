organizational, assistance, given, to, frei, the, effort, to, keep, dur, n, in, the, race, the, propaganda, campaign, to, denigrate, allende, were, indispensable, ingredients, of, frei, s, success, and, they, thought, that, his, chances, of, winning, and, the, good, progress, of, his, campaign, would, have, been, doubtful, without, the, covert, support, of, the, government, of, the, united, states, thus, in, 1964, allende, lost, once, more, as, the, frap, candidate, polling, 38, 6, of, the, votes, against, 55, 6, for, christian, democrat, eduardo, frei, as, it, became, clear, that, the, election, would, be, a, race, between, allende, and, frei, the, political, right, which, initially, had, backed, radical, julio, dur, n, settled, for, frei, as, the, lesser, evil, allende, was, considered, part, of, the, moderate, wing, of, the, socialists, with, support, from, the, communists, who, favored, taking, power, via, parliamentary, democracy, in, contrast, the, left, wing, of, the, socialists, led, by, carlos, altamirano, and, several, other, far, left, parties, called, for, violent, insurrection, some, argue, however, that, this, was, reversed, at, the, end, of, his,

explained, his, reasons, for, agreeing, to, the, guarantees, some, critics, have, interpreted, allende, s, responses, as, an, admission, that, signing, the, statute, was, only, a, tactical, move, in, his, speech, to, the, chilean, legislature, following, his, election, allende, made, clear, his, intention, to, move, chile, from, a, capitalist, to, a, socialist, society, we, are, moving, towards, socialism, not, from, an, academic, love, for, a, doctrinaire, system, but, encouraged, by, the, strength, of, our, people, who, know, that, it, is, an, inescapable, demand, if, we, are, to, overcome, backwardness, and, who, feel, that, a, socialist, regime, is, the, only, way, available, to, modern, nations, who, want, to, build, rationally, in, freedom, independence, and, dignity, we, are, moving, towards, socialism, because, the, people, through, their, vote, have, freely, rejected, capitalism, as, a, system, which, has, resulted, in, a, crudely, unequal, society, a, society, deformed, by, social, injustice, and, degraded, by, the, deterioration, of, the, very, foundations, of, human, solidarity, upon, assuming, the, presidency, allende, began, to, carry, out, his, platform, of,

which, may, explain, allende, s, haste, to, restructure, the, economy, not, only, was, a, major, restructuring, program, organized, the, vuskovic, plan, he, also, had, to, make, it, a, success, if, a, left, wing, successor, to, allende, was, going, to, be, elected, in, the, first, year, of, allende, s, term, the, short, term, economic, results, of, the, economy, minister, pedro, vuskovic, s, expansive, monetary, policy, were, highly, favorable, 12, industrial, growth, and, an, 8, 6, increase, in, gdp, accompanied, by, major, declines, in, inflation, down, from, 34, 9, to, 22, 1, and,

again, in, 1973, to, the, lowest, ever, recorded, the, combination, of, inflation, and, price, controls, together, with, the, disappearance, of, basic, commodities, from, supermarket, shelves, led, to, the, rise, of, black, markets, in, rice, beans, sugar, and, flour, the, chilean, economic, situation, was, also, somewhat, exacerbated, due, to, a, us, backed, campaign, to, fund, worker, strikes, in, certain, sectors, of, the, economy, the, allende, government, announced, it, would, default, on, debts, owed, to, international, creditors, and, foreign, governments, allende, also, froze, all, prices, while, raising, salaries, his, implementation, of, the, policies, was, strongly, opposed, by, landowners, employers, businessmen, and, transporters, associations, and, some, civil, servants, and, professional, unions, the, rightist, opposition, was, led, by, the, national, party, the, roman, catholic, church, which, in, 1973, was, displeased, with, the, direction, of, educational, policy, and, eventually, the, christian, democrats, there, were, growing, tensions, with, foreign, multinational, corporations, and, the, government, of, the, united, states, allende, undertook, the, pioneeristic, project, cybersyn, a, distributed, decision, support, system, for, decentralized, economic, planning, developed, by, british, cybernetics, expert, stafford, beer, based, on, the, experimental, viable, system, model, and, the, neural, network, approach, to, organizational, design, the, project, consisted, of, four, modules, a, network, of, telex, machines, cybernet, in, all, state, run, enterprises, that, would, transmit, and, receive, information, with, the, government, in, santiago, information, from, the, field, would, be, fed, into, statistical, modeling, software, cyberstride, that, would, monitor, production, indicators, such, as, raw, material, supplies, or, high, rates, of, worker, absenteeism, in, almost, real, time, alerting, the, workers, in, the, first, case, and, in, abnormal, situations, if, those, parameters, fell, outside, acceptable, ranges, by, a, very, large, degree, also, the, central, government, the, information, would, also, be, input, into, an, economic, simulation, software, checo, for, chilean, economic, simulator, which, featured, a, bayesian, filtering, and, control, setting, that, the, government, could, use, to, forecast, the, possible, outcome, of, economic, decisions, finally, a, sophisticated, operations, room, opsroom, would, provide, a, space, where, managers, could, see, relevant, economic, data, formulate, feasible, responses, to, emergencies, and, transmit, advice, and, directives, to, enterprises, and, factories, in, alarm, situations, by, using, the, telex, network, in, conjunction, with, the, system, the, cybersyn, development, team, also, planned, the, cyberfolk, device, system, a, closed, television, circuit, connected, to, an, interactive, apparatus, that, would, enable, the, citizenry, to, actively, participate, in, economic, and, political, decision, making, allende, raised, wages, on, a, number, of, occasions, throughout, 1970, and, 1971, but, the, wage, hikes, were, negated, by, ongoing, inflation, of, chile, s, fiat, currency, although, price, rises, had, been, high, even, under, frei, 27, a, year, between, 1967, and, 1970, a, basic, basket, of, consumer, goods, rose, by, 120, from, 190, to, 421, escudos, in, one, month, alone, august, 1972, from, 1970, to, 1972, while, allende, was, in, government, exports, fell, 24, and, imports, rose, 26, with, imports, of, food, rising, an, estimated, 149, export, income, fell, due, to, a, hard, hit, copper, industry, the, price, of, copper, on, international, markets, fell, by, almost, a, third, and, post, nationalization, copper, production, fell, as, well, copper, is, chile, s, single, most, important, export, as, more, than, half, of, chile, s, export, receipts, were, from, that, sole, commodity, the, price, of, copper, fell, from, a, peak, of, 66, per, ton, in, 1970, to, only, 48, 49, in, 1971, and, 1972, chile, was, already, dependent, on, food, imports, and, the, decline, in, export, earnings, coincided, with, declines, in, domestic, food, production, following, allende, s, agrarian, reforms, in, 1971, chile, re, established, diplomatic, relations, with, cuba, joining, mexico, and, canada, in, rejecting, a, previously, established, organization, of, american, states, convention, prohibiting, governments, in, the, western, hemisphere, from, establishing, diplomatic, relations, with, cuba, shortly, afterward, cuban, president, fidel, castro, made, a, month, long, visit, to, chile, originally, the, visit, was, supposed, to, be, one, week, however, castro, enjoyed, chile, and, one, week, led, to, another, despite, his, attitude, of, socialist, solidarity, castro, was, reportedly, critical, of, allende, s, policies, castro, was, quoted, as, saying, that, marxism, is, a, revolution, of, production, whereas, allende, s, was, a, revolution, of, consumption, in, october, 1972, the, first, of, what, were, to, be, a, wave, of, strikes, was, led, first, by, truckers, and, later, by, small, businessmen, some, mostly, professional, unions, and, some, student, groups, other, than, the, inevitable, damage, to, the, economy, the, chief, effect, of, the, 24, day, strike, was, to, induce, allende, to, bring, the, head, of, the, army, general, carlos, prats, into, the, government, as, interior, minister, allende, also, instructed, the, government, to, commandeer, trucks, to, keep, the, nation, from, coming, to, a, halt, government, supporters, also, helped, to, mobilize, trucks, and, buses, but, violence, served, as, a, deterrent, to, full, mobilization, even, with, police, protection, for, the, strike, breakers, allende, s, actions, were, eventually, declared, unlawful, by, the, chilean, appeals, court, and, the, government, was, ordered, to, return, trucks, to, their, owners, throughout, his, presidency, racial, tensions, between, the, poor, descendants, of, indigenous, people, who, supported, allende, s, reforms, and, the, white, elite, increased, throughout, his, presidency, allende, remained, at, odds, with, the, chilean, congress, which, was, dominated, by, the, christian, democratic, party, in, 1964, eduardo, frei, had, promised, a, revolution, in, liberty, a, middle, class, revolution, that, was, funded, by, the, united, states, government, s, alliance, for, progress, frei, carried, out, a, series, of, progressive, reforms, including, land, reform, an, issue, that, had, not, been, touched, since, chile, s, independence, in, the, early, 19th, century, according, to, historian, marian, schlotterbeck, this, was, kennedy, s, vision, stave, off, the, threat, of, communist, revolution, by, improving, standards, of, living, across, the, continent, the, christian, democrats, had, campaigned, on, a, socialist, platform, in, the, 1970, elections, but, drifted, away, from, those, positions, during, allende, s, presidency, and, accused, allende, of, leading, chile, toward, a, cuban, style, dictatorship, and, sought, to, overturn, many, of, his, more, radical, policies, they, eventually, formed, a, coalition, with, the, national, party, allende, and, his, opponents, in, congress, repeatedly, accused, each, other, of, undermining, the, chilean, constitution, and, acting, undemocratically, allende, s, increasingly, bold, socialist, policies, partly, in, response, to, pressure, from, some, of, the, more, radical, members, within, his, coalition, combined, with, his, close, contacts, with, cuba, heightened, fears, in, washington, the, nixon, administration, continued, exerting, economic, pressure, on, chile, via, multilateral, organizations, and, continued, to, back, allende, s, opponents, in, the, chilean, congress, almost, immediately, after, his, election, nixon, directed, cia, and, us, state, department, officials, to, put, pressure, on, the, allende, government, his, economic, policies, were, used, by, economists, rudi, dornbusch, and, sebasti, n, edwards, to, coin, the, term, macroeconomic, populism, in, 1972, chile, s, inflation, stood, at, 150, salvador, allende, took, office, in, a, difficult, international, context, chile, was, aligned, with, the, united, states, in, 1970, elsewhere, in, latin, america, brazil, argentina, and, bolivia, were, ruled, by, conservative, military, dictatorships, soon, to, be, joined, by, uruguay, colombia, and, venezuela, also, had, conservative, but, democratically, elected, governments, only, cuba, peru, and, mexico, viewed, the, chilean, socialist, experiment, with, sympathy, under, allende, s, presidency, chile, joined, the, non, aligned, movement, a, position, that, was, then, almost, unique, in, latin, america, chile, which, until, then, had, been, fussy, about, ideological, boundaries, diversified, its, diplomatic, and, trade, relations, regardless, of, the, internal, political, regime, of, each, country, the, government, established, diplomatic, relations, with, two, latin, american, countries, cuba, and, guyana, seven, african,

council, the, chilean, representative, gonzalo, martner, garc, a, formulated, four, major, proposals, summarized, by, the, historian, jorge, magasich, 1, to, ask, the, united, states, for, a, moratorium, on, external, debt, for, a, decade, in, order, to, allocate, these, sums, to, development, policies, 2, to, create, a, latin, american, central, bank, to, invest, latin, america, s, reserves, 70, of, which, are, in, the, united, states, to, receive, the, region, s, deposits, and, assets, and, to, coordinate, the, operations, of, the, central, banks, in, order, to, protect, the, region, from, financial, turbulence, 3, promote, the, creation, of, a, global, technology, fund, for, development, fed, by, compulsory, contributions, of, licenses, industrial, processes, and, other, funds, for, research, so, as, to, limit, the, abuses, associated, with, technological, property, 4, create, a, latin, american, organisation, for, the, development, of, science, and, technology, appropriate, to, the, region, he, began, negotiations, with, bolivia, over, the, historical, dispute, between, the, two, countries, bolivia, had, lost, access, to, the, sea, since, the, war, of, the, pacific, between, 1879, and, 1884, and, welcomed, bolivia, s, maritime, request, nevertheless, relations, became, tense, again, following, a, coup, d, tat, by, bolivian, general, hugo, banzer, in, august, 1971, at, the, same, time, chile, granted, asylum, to, thousands, of, political, exiles, from, latin, american, countries, salvador, allende, openly, rejected, the, influence, of, the, organization, of, american, states, oas, a, body, close, to, the, united, states, government, and, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, gatt, which, favored, the, interests, of, more, developed, countries, on, the, other, hand, he, was, a, fervent, defender, of, the, united, nations, conference, on, trade, and, development, unctad, which, he, considered, to, be, more, representative, since, it, allowed, economic, and, trade, issues, to, be, negotiated, on, an, equal, legal, footing, in, a, speech, to, unctad, he, also, warned, of, the, policy, of, the, united, states, japan, and, the, european, economic, community, to, progressively, eliminate, obstacles, to, free, trade, he, said, that, freeing, up, trade, erases, at, a, stroke, the, benefits, that, the, generalised, system, of, preferences, brings, to, developing, countries, allende, s, popular, unity, government, tried, to, maintain, normal, relations, with, the, united, states, when, chile, nationalized, its, copper, industry, the, united, states, government, cut, off, support, and, increased, its, support, to, the, opposition, forced, to, seek, alternative, sources, of, trade, and, finance, chile, gained, commitments, from, the, soviet, union, to, invest, some, 400, million, in, chile, in, the, next, six, years, the, united, states, departement, of, state, put, it, at, 115, million, from, eastern, europe, and, 65, million, from, china, while, soviet, and, chilean, popular, unity, sources, put, it, at, total, of, 620, million, from, socialist, countries, much, of, the, credit, was, never, utilized, and, the, soviets, were, not, willing, to, subsidize, chile, the, same, way, they, did, for, cuba, allende, s, government, was, disappointed, that, it, received, far, less, economic, assistance, from, the, soviets, than, it, hoped, for, trade, between, the, two, countries, did, not, significantly, increase, and, the, credits, were, mainly, linked, to, the, purchase, of, soviet, equipment, moreover, credits, from, the, soviet, union, were, much, less, than, those, provided, to, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, countries, of, the, eastern, bloc, when, allende, visited, the, soviet, union, in, late, 1972, in, search, of, more, aid, and, additional, lines, of, credit, after, three, years, he, was, turned, down, the, united, states, opposition, to, allende, started, several, years, before, he, was, elected, president, of, chile, declassified, documents, show, that, from, 1962, to, 1964, the, cia, spent, 3, million, on, anti, allende, propaganda, to, scare, voters, away, from, allende, s, frap, coalition, and, spent, a, total, of, 2, 6, million, to, finance, the, presidential, campaign, of, eduardo, frei, the, possibility, of, allende, winning, chile, s, 1970, election, was, deemed, a, disaster, by, the, nixon, administration, that, wanted, to, protect, american, geopolitical, interests, by, preventing, the, spread, of, communism, during, the, cold, war, in, september, 1970, then, united, states, president, richard, nixon, informed, the, cia, that, an, allende, government, in, chile, would, not, be, acceptable, and, authorized, 10, million, to, stop, allende, from, coming, to, power, or, unseat, him, a, cia, document, declared, it, is, firm, and, continuing, policy, that, allende, be, overthrown, by, a, coup, henry, kissinger, s, 40, committee, and, the, cia, planned, to, impede, allende, s, investiture, as, president, of, chile, with, covert, efforts, known, as, track, i, and, track, ii, track, i, sought, to, prevent, allende, from, assuming, power, via, so, called, parliamentary, trickery, while, under, the, track, ii, initiative, the, cia, tried, to, convince, key, chilean, military, officers, to, carry, out, a, coup, some, point, to, the, involvement, of, the, defense, intelligence, agency, agents, that, allegedly, secured, the, missiles, used, to, bombard, la, moneda, palace, in, fact, open, us, military, aid, to, chile, continued, during, the, allende, administration, and, the, national, government, was, very, much, aware, of, that, although, there, is, no, record, that, allende, himself, believed, that, such, assistance, was, anything, but, beneficial, to, chile, during, richard, nixon, s, presidency, united, states, officials, attempted, to, prevent, allende, s, election, by, financing, political, parties, aligned, with, opposition, candidate, jorge, alessandri, and, supporting, strikes, in, the, mining, and, transportation, sectors, after, the, 1970, election, the, track, i, operation, attempted, to, incite, chile, s, outgoing, president, eduardo, frei, montalva, to, persuade, his, party, pdc, to, vote, in, congress, for, alessandri, under, the, plan, alessandri, would, resign, his, office, immediately, after, assuming, it, and, call, new, elections, eduardo, frei, would, then, be, constitutionally, able, to, run, again, since, the, chilean, constitution, did, not, allow, a, president, to, hold, two, consecutive, terms, but, allowed, multiple, non, consecutive, ones, and, presumably, easily, defeat, allende, the, chilean, congress, instead, chose, allende, as, president, on, the, condition, that, he, would, sign, a, statute, of, constitutional, guarantees, affirming, that, he, would, respect, and, obey, the, chilean, constitution, and, that, his, reforms, would, not, undermine, any, of, its, elements, track, ii, was, aborted, as, parallel, initiatives, already, underway, within, the, chilean, military, rendered, it, moot, during, the, second, term, of, office, of, democratic, president, bill, clinton, the, cia, acknowledged, having, played, a, role, in, chilean, politics, before, the, coup, but, its, degree, of, involvement, is, debated, the, cia, was, notified, by, its, chilean, contacts, of, the, impending, coup, two, days, in, advance, but, contends, it, played, no, direct, role, in, the, coup, much, of, the, internal, opposition, to, allende, s, policies, came, from, the, business, sector, and, recently, released, united, states, government, documents, confirm, that, the, united, states, indirectly, funded, the, truck, drivers, strike, which, exacerbated, the, already, chaotic, economic, situation, before, the, coup, the, most, prominent, united, states, corporations, in, chile, before, allende, s, presidency, were, the, anaconda, and, kennecott, copper, companies, and, itt, corporation, international, telephone, and, telegraph, both, copper, corporations, aimed, to, expand, privatized, copper, production, in, the, city, of, sewell, in, the, chilean, andes, where, the, world, s, largest, underground, copper, mine, el, teniente, was, located, at, the, end, of, 1968, according, to, united, states, department, of, commerce, data, united, states, corporate, holdings, in, chile, amounted, to, 964, million, anaconda, and, kennecott, accounted, for, 28, of, united,

president, nixon, that, the, united, states, didn, t, do, it, referring, to, the, coup, but, we, helped, them, created, the, conditions, as, great, as, possible, recent, documents, declassified, under, the, clinton, administration, s, chile, declassification, project, show, that, the, united, states, government, and, the, cia, sought, to, overthrow, allende, in, 1970, immediately, before, he, took, office, project, fubelt, many, documents, regarding, the, united, states, intervention, in, chile, remain, classified, those, that, have, been, declassified, showed, that, nixon, kissinger, and, the, united, states, government, were, aware, of, the, coup, and, the, plans, to, overthrow, allende, s, democratically, elected, government, political, and, moral, support, came, mostly, through, the, communist, party, and, unions, of, the, soviet, union, for, instance, allende, received, the, lenin, peace, prize, from, the, soviet, union, in, 1972, at, the, same, time, there, were, some, fundamental, differences, between, allende, and, soviet, political, analysts, who, believed, that, some, violence, or, measures, that, those, analysts, theoretically, considered, to, be, just, should, have, been, used, declarations, from, kgb, general, nikolai, leonov, former, deputy, chief, of, the, first, chief, directorate, of, the, kgb, confirmed, that, the, soviet, union, supported, allende, s, government, economically, politically, and, militarily, leonov, stated, in, an, interview, at, the, chilean, center, of, public, studies, cep, that, the, soviet, economic, support, included, over, 100, million, in, credit, three, fishing, ships, that, distributed, 17, 000, tons, of, frozen, fish, to, the, population, factories, as, help, after, the, 1971, earthquake, 3, 100, tractors, 74, 000, tons, of, wheat, and, more, than, a, million, tins, of, condensed, milk, in, mid, 1973, the, soviets, approved, the, delivery, of, weapons, artillery, and, tanks, to, the, chilean, army, when, news, of, an, attempt, from, the, army, to, depose, allende, through, a, coup, d, tat, reached, soviet, officials, the, shipment, was, redirected, to, another, country, allende, is, mentioned, in, a, book, written, by, the, official, historian, of, the, british, intelligence, mi5, christopher, andrew, according, to, sis, and, andrew, the, book, is, based, on, the, handwritten, notes, of, kgb, archivist, defector, vasili, mitrokhin, andrew, alleged, that, the, kgb, said, that, allende, was, made, to, understand, the, necessity, of, reorganizing, chile, s, army, and, intelligence, services, and, of, setting, up, a, relationship, between, chile, s, and, the, ussr, s, intelligence, services, the, soviets, observed, closely, whether, the, alternative, form, of, socialism, could, work, and, they, did, not, interfere, with, the, chileans, decisions, nikolai, leonov, affirmed, that, whenever, he, tried, to, give, advice, to, latin, american, leaders, he, was, usually, turned, down, by, them, and, he, was, told, that, they, had, their, own, understanding, on, how, to, conduct, political, business, in, their, countries, leonov, added, that, the, relationships, of, kgb, agents, with, latin, american, leaders, did, not, involve, intelligence, because, their, intelligence, target, was, the, united, states, since, many, north, americans, were, living, in, the, region, the, soviets, were, focusing, in, recruiting, agents, from, the, united, states, latin, america, was, also, a, better, region, for, kgb, agents, to, get, in, touch, with, their, informants, from, the, cia, or, other, contacts, from, the, united, states, than, inside, that, country, on, 29, june, 1973, colonel, roberto, souper, surrounded, the, presidential, palace, la, moneda, with, his, tank, regiment, but, failed, to, depose, the, government, that, failed, coup, d, tat, known, as, the, tanquetazo, tank, putsch, organised, by, the, nationalist, patria, y, libertad, paramilitary, group, was, followed, by, a, general, strike, at, the, end, of, july, that, included, the, copper, miners, of, el, teniente, in, august, 1973, a, constitutional, crisis, occurred, and, the, supreme, court, of, chile, publicly, complained, about, the, inability, of, the, allende, government, to, enforce, the, law, of, the, land, on, 22, august, the, chamber, of, deputies, with, the, christian, democrats, uniting, with, the, national, party, accused, the, government, of, unconstitutional, acts, through, allende, s, refusal, to, promulgate, constitutional, amendments, already, approved, by, the, chamber, which, would, have, prevented, his, government, from, continuing, his, massive, nationalization, plan, and, called, upon, the, military, to, enforce, constitutional, order, for, months, allende, had, feared, calling, upon, the, carabineros, carabineers, the, national, police, force, suspecting, them, of, disloyalty, to, his, government, on, 9, august, president, allende, appointed, general, carlos, prats, as, minister, of, defence, on, 24, august, 1973, general, prats, was, forced, to, resign, both, as, defense, minister, and, as, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, army, embarrassed, by, both, the, alejandrina, cox, incident, and, a, public, protest, in, front, of, his, house, by, the, wives, of, his, generals, general, augusto, pinochet, replaced, him, as, army, commander, in, chief, the, same, day, on, 22, august, 1973, the, christian, democrats, and, the, national, party, members, of, the, chamber, of, deputies, joined, to, vote, 81, to, 47, in, favor, of, a, resolution, that, made, accusation, of, disregard, by, the, government, of, the, separation, of, powers, and, arrogating, legislative, and, judicial, prerogatives, to, the, executive, branch, of, government, among, other, alleged, constitutional, violations, the, resolution, asked, the, authorities, to, put, an, immediate, end, to, breach, the, constitution, with, the, goal, of, redirecting, government, activity, toward, the, path, of, law, and, ensuring, the, constitutional, order, of, our, nation, and, the, essential, underpinnings, of, democratic, co, existence, among, chileans, the, resolution, declared, that, allende, s, government, sought, to, conquer, absolute, power, with, the, obvious, purpose, of, subjecting, all, citizens, to, the, strictest, political, and, economic, control, by, the, state, the, goal, of, establishing, a, totalitarian, system, and, claimed, that, the, government, had, made, violations, of, the, constitution, a, permanent, system, of, conduct, specifically, the, government, of, allende, was, accused, of, ruling, by, decree, and, thwarting, the, normal, legislative, system, refusing, to, enforce, judicial, decisions, against, its, partisans, not, carrying, out, sentences, and, judicial, resolutions, that, contravened, its, objectives, ignoring, the, decrees, of, the, independent, general, comptroller, s, office, sundry, media, offenses, including, usurping, control, of, the, national, television, network, and, applying, economic, pressure, against, those, media, organizations, that, were, not, unconditional, supporters, of, the, government, allowing, its, supporters, to, assemble, with, arms, and, preventing, the, same, by, its, right, wing, opponents, supporting, more, than, 1, 500, illegal, takeovers, of, farms, illegal, repression, of, the, el, teniente, miners, strike, and, illegally, limiting, emigration, finally, the, resolution, condemned, the, creation, and, development, of, government, protected, socialist, armed, groups, which, were, said, to, be, headed, towards, a, confrontation, with, the, armed, forces, president, allende, s, efforts, to, re, organize, the, military, and, the, police, forces, were, characterized, as, notorious, attempts, to, use, the, armed, and, police, forces, for, partisan, ends, destroy, their, institutional, hierarchy, and, politically, infiltrate, their, ranks, the, resolution, was, later, used, by, pinochet, as, a, way, to, justify, the, coup, which, occurred, two, weeks, later, on, 24, august, 1973, two, days, after, the, resolution, allende, responded, he, accused, the, opposition, of, trying, to, incite, a, military, coup, by, encouraging, the, armed, forces, to, disobey, civilian, authorities, he, described, the, congress, s, declaration, as, destined, to, damage, the, country, s, prestige, abroad, and, create, internal, confusion, and, predicted, it, will, facilitate, the, seditious, intention, of, certain, sectors, he, observed, that, the, declaration, passed, 81, 47, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, had, not, obtained, the, two, thirds, senate, majority, constitutionally, required, to, convict, the, president, of, abuse, of, power, thus, the, congress, was, invoking, the, intervention, of, the, armed, forces, and, of, order, against, a, democratically, elected, government, and, subordinat, political, representation, of, national, sovereignty, to, the, armed, institutions, which, neither, can, nor, ought, to, assume, either, political, functions, or, the, representation, of, the, popular, will, allende, argued, that, he, had, obeyed, constitutional, means, for, including, military, men, to, the, cabinet, at, the, service, of, civic, peace, and, national, security, defending, republican, institutions, against, insurrection, and, terrorism, in, contrast, he, said, that, congress, was, promoting, a, coup, d, tat, or, a, civil, war, with, a, declaration, full, of, affirmations, that, had, already, been, refuted, beforehand, and, which, in, substance, and, process, directly, handing, it, to, the, ministers, rather, than, directly, handing, it, to, the, president, violated, a, dozen, articles, of, the, then, current, constitution, he, further, argued, that, the, legislature, was, usurping, the, government, s, executive, function, allende, wrote, chilean, democracy, is, a, conquest, by, all, of, the, people, it, is, neither, the, work, nor, the, gift, of, the, exploiting, classes, and, it, will, be, defended, by, those, who, with, sacrifices, accumulated, over, generations, have, imposed, it, with, a, tranquil, conscience, i, sustain, that, never, before, has, chile, had, a, more, democratic, government, than, that, over, which, i, have, the, honor, to, preside, i, solemnly, reiterate, my, decision, to, develop, democracy, and, a, state, of, law, to, their, ultimate, consequences, congress, has, made, itself, a, bastion, against, the, transformations, and, has, done, everything, it, can, to, perturb, the, functioning, of, the, finances, and, of, the, institutions, sterilizing, all, creative, initiatives, adding, that, economic, and, political, means, would, be, needed, to, relieve, the, country, s, current, crisis, and, that, the, congress, was, obstructing, said, means, having, already, paralyzed, the, state, they, sought, to, destroy, it, he, concluded, by, calling, upon, the, workers, and, all, democrats, and, patriots, to, join, him, in, defending, the, chilean, constitution, and, the, revolutionary, process, in, early, september, 1973, allende, floated, the, idea, of, resolving, the, constitutional, crisis, with, a, plebiscite, his, speech, outlining, such, a, solution, was, scheduled, for, 11, september, but, he, was, never, able, to, deliver, it, on, that, same, day, the, chilean, military, under, pinochet, aided, by, the, united, states, and, its, cia, staged, a, coup, against, allende, who, was, at, the, head, of, the, first, democratically, elected, marxist, government, in, latin, america, historian, peter, winn, described, the, 1973, coup, as, one, of, the, most, violent, events, in, chilean, history, it, led, to, a, series, of, human, rights, abuses, in, chile, under, pinochet, who, initiated, a, brutal, and, long, lasting, campaign, of, political, suppression, through, torture, murder, and, exile, which, significantly, weakened, leftist, opposition, to, the, military, dictatorship, of, chile, which, ruled, the, country, until, 1990, due, to, the, coup, s, occurrence, on, the, same, date, as, the, 11, september, attacks, in, the, united, states, it, has, sometimes, been, referred, to, as, the, other, 9, 11, just, before, the, capture, of, la, moneda, the, presidential, palace, with, gunfire, and, explosions, clearly, audible, in, the, background, allende, gave, his, farewell, speech, to, chileans, on, live, radio, speaking, of, himself, in, the, past, tense, of, his, love, for, chile, and, of, his, deep, faith, in, its, future, he, stated, that, his, commitment, to, chile, did, not, allow, him, to, take, an, easy, way, out, and, he, would, not, be, used, as, a, propaganda, tool, by, those, he, called, traitors, he, refused, an, offer, of, safe, passage, juan, seoane, chief, of, president, allende, s, bodyguard, at, the, time, of, the, events, and, who, was, with, allende, until, moments, before, his, death, declared, in, an, interview, reported, by, the, university, of, chile, allende, began, to, say, goodbye, to, us, one, by, one, he, gave, us, a, hug, and, told, us, thank, you, for, everything, comrade, thank, you, for, everything, and, then, he, said, that, he, was, going, to, leave, last, he, walked, to, the, end, of, the, line, with, his, ak, turned, around, behind, a, wall, and, then, he, shouted, allende, doesn, t, surrender, the, shot, was, heard, as, fifteen, meters, from, where, we, were, reports, in, el, tiempo, and, other, latin, american, media, confirmed, allende, s, last, words, shortly, afterwards, the, coup, plotters, announced, that, allende, had, committed, suicide, an, official, announcement, declared, that, the, weapon, he, had, used, was, an, automatic, rifle, before, his, death, he, had, been, photographed, several, times, holding, an, ak, 47, a, gift, from, fidel, castro, he, was, found, dead, with, that, gun, according, to, contemporaneous, statements, made, by, officials, in, the, pinochet, regime, in, an, interview, with, david, frost, allende, s, first, cousin, isabel, allende, said, that, at, a, family, lunch, nine, days, before, his, death, allende, had, said, that, he, would, either, stay, till, the, end, of, this, term, of, presidency, or, he, would, be, taken, out, feet, first, lingering, doubts, regarding, the, manner, of, allende, s, death, persisted, throughout, the, period, of, the, pinochet, regime, many, chileans, and, independent, observers, refused, to, accept, on, faith, the, government, s, version, of, events, amid, speculation, that, allende, had, been, murdered, by, government, agents, pinochet, had, long, left, power, and, died, when, in, 2011, a, chilean, court, opened, a, criminal, investigation, into, the, circumstances, of, allende, s, death, the, ongoing, criminal, investigation, led, to, a, may, 2011, court, order, that, allende, s, remains, be, exhumed, and, autopsied, by, an, international, team, of, experts, results, of, the, autopsy, were, officially, released, in, mid, july, 2011, the, team, of, experts, concluded, that, the, former, president, had, shot, himself, with, an, ak, 47, assault, rifle, in, december, 2011, the, judge, in, charge, of, the, investigation, affirmed, the, experts, findings, and, ruled, allende, s, death, a, suicide, on, 11, september,

conclusions, are, consistent, with, what, we, already, believed, when, faced, with, extreme, circumstances, he, made, the, decision, of, taking, his, own, life, instead, of, being, humiliated, the, definitive, and, unanimous, results, produced, by, the, 2011, chilean, judicial, investigation, appear, to, have, laid, to, rest, decades, of, nagging, suspicions, that, allende, might, have, been, assassinated, by, the, chilean, armed, forces, public, acceptance, of, the, suicide, theory, had, already, been, growing, for, much, of, the, previous, decade, in, a, post, junta, chile, where, restrictions, on, free, speech, were, steadily, eroding, independent, and, seemingly, reliable, witnesses, began, to, tell, their, stories, to, the, news, media, and, to, human, rights, researchers,
