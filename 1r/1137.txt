manuel, i, komnenos, greek, romanized, manou, l, komn, n, s, 28, november, 1118, 24, september, 1180, latinized, as, comnenus, also, called, porphyrogenitus, greek, born, in, the, purple, was, a, byzantine, emperor, of, the, 12th, century, who, reigned, over, a, crucial, turning, point, in, the, history, of, byzantium, and, the, mediterranean, his, reign, saw, the, last, flowering, of, the, komnenian, restoration, during, which, the, byzantine, empire, experienced, a, resurgence, of, military, and, economic, power, and, enjoyed, a, cultural, revival, eager, to, restore, his, empire, to, its, past, glories, as, the, great, power, of, the, mediterranean, world, manuel, pursued, an, energetic, and, ambitious, foreign, policy, in, the, process, he, made, alliances, with, pope, adrian, iv, and, the, resurgent, west, he, invaded, the, norman, kingdom, of, sicily, although, unsuccessfully, being, the, last, eastern, roman, emperor, to, attempt, reconquests, in, the, western, mediterranean, the, passage, of, the, potentially, dangerous, second, crusade, through, his, empire, was, adroitly, managed, manuel, established, a, byzantine, protectorate, over, the, crusader, states, of, outremer, facing, muslim, advances, in, the, holy, land, he, made, common, cause, with, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, and, participated, in, a, combined, invasion, of, fatimid, egypt, manuel, reshaped, the, political, maps, of, the, balkans, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, placing, the, kingdoms, of, hungary, and, outremer, under, byzantine, hegemony, and, campaigning, aggressively, against, his, neighbours, both, in, the, west, and, in, the, east, however, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, manuel, s, achievements, in, the, east, were, compromised, by, a, serious, defeat, at, myriokephalon, which, in, large, part, resulted, from, his, arrogance, in, attacking, a, well, defended, seljuk, position, although, the, byzantines, recovered, and, manuel, concluded, an, advantageous, peace, with, sultan, kilij, arslan, ii, myriokephalon, proved, to, be, the, final, unsuccessful, effort, by, the, empire, to, recover, the, interior, of, anatolia, from, the, turks, called, ho, megas, translated, as, the, great, by, the, greeks, manuel, is, known, to, have, inspired, intense, loyalty, in, those, who, served, him, he, also, appears, as, the, hero, of, a, history, written, by, his, secretary, john, kinnamos, in, which, every, virtue, is, attributed, to, him, manuel, who, was, influenced, by, his, contact, with, western, crusaders, enjoyed, the, reputation, of, the, most, blessed, emperor, of, constantinople, in, parts, of, the, latin, world, as, well, some, historians, have, been, less, enthusiastic, about, him, however, asserting, that, the, great, power, he, wielded, was, not, his, own, personal, achievement, but, that, of, the, dynasty, he, represented, further, it, has, also, been, argued, that, since, byzantine, imperial, power, declined, catastrophically, after, manuel, s, death, it, is, only, natural, to, look, for, the, causes, of, this, decline, in, his, reign, born, on, 28, november, 1118, manuel, komnenos, was, the, fourth, son, of, john, ii, komnenos, and, irene, of, hungary, so, it, seemed, very, unlikely, that, he, would, succeed, his, father, his, maternal, grandfather, was, st, ladislaus, manuel, favourably, impressed, his, father, by, his, courage, and, fortitude, during, the, unsuccessful, siege, of, neocaesarea, 1140, against, the, danishmendid, turks, in, 1143, john, ii, lay, dying, as, a, result, of, an, infected, wound, on, his, deathbed, he, chose, manuel, as, his, successor, in, preference, to, his, elder, surviving, brother, isaac, john, cited, manuel, s, courage, and, readiness, to, take, advice, in, contrast, to, isaac, s, irascibility, and, unbending, pride, as, the, reasons, for, his, choice, after, john, died, on, 8, april, 1143, his, son, manuel, was, acclaimed, emperor, by, the, armies, yet, his, succession, was, by, no, means, assured, with, his, father, s, army, in, the, wilds, of, cilicia, far, from, constantinople, he, recognised, that, it, was, vital, he, should, return, to, the, capital, as, soon, as, possible, he, still, had, to, take, care, of, his, father, s, funeral, and, tradition, demanded, he, organise, the, foundation, of, a, monastery, on, the, spot, where, his, father, died, swiftly, he, dispatched, the, megas, domestikos, john, axouch, ahead, of, him, with, orders, to, arrest, his, most, dangerous, potential, rival, his, brother, isaac, who, was, living, in, the, great, palace, with, instant, access, to, the, imperial, treasure, and, regalia, axouch, arrived, in, the, capital, even, before, news, of, the, emperor, s, death, had, reached, it, he, quickly, secured, the, loyalty, of, the, city, and, when, manuel, entered, the, capital, in, august, 1143, he, was, crowned, by, the, new, patriarch, michael, ii, kourkouas, a, few, days, later, with, nothing, more, to, fear, as, his, position, as, emperor, was, now, secure, manuel, ordered, the, release, of, isaac, then, he, ordered, two, golden, pieces, to, be, given, to, every, householder, in, constantinople, and, 200, pounds, of, gold, including, 200, silver, pieces, annually, to, be, given, to, the, byzantine, church, the, empire, that, manuel, inherited, from, his, father, was, in, a, more, stable, position, than, it, had, been, a, century, earlier, in, the, late, 11th, century, the, byzantine, empire, had, faced, marked, military, and, political, decline, but, this, decline, had, been, arrested, and, largely, reversed, by, the, leadership, of, manuel, s, grandfather, and, father, nevertheless, the, empire, continued, to, face, formidable, challenges, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, the, normans, of, sicily, had, removed, italy, from, the, control, of, the, byzantine, emperor, the, seljuk, turks, had, done, the, same, with, central, anatolia, and, in, the, levant, a, new, force, had, appeared, the, crusader, states, which, presented, the, byzantine, empire, with, new, challenges, now, more, than, at, any, time, during, the, preceding, centuries, the, task, facing, the, emperor, was, daunting, indeed, the, first, test, of, manuel, s, reign, came, in, 1144, when, he, was, faced, with, a, demand, by, raymond, prince, of, antioch, for, the, cession, of, cilician, territories, however, later, that, year, the, crusader, county, of, edessa, was, engulfed, by, the, tide, of, a, resurgent, islamic, jihad, under, imad, ad, din, zengi, raymond, realized, that, immediate, help, from, the, west, was, out, of, the, question, with, his, eastern, flank, now, dangerously, exposed, to, this, new, threat, there, seemed, little, option, but, for, him, to, prepare, for, a, humiliating, visit, to, constantinople, swallowing, his, pride, he, made, the, journey, north, to, submit, to, manuel, and, ask, for, protection, he, was, promised, the, support, that, he, had, requested, and, his, allegiance, to, byzantium, was, secured, in, 1146, manuel, assembled, his, army, at, the, military, base, lopadion, and, set, out, on, a, punitive, expedition, against, mas, ud, the, sultan, of, r, m, who, had, been, repeatedly, violating, the, frontiers, of, the, empire, in, western, anatolia, and, cilicia, there, was, no, attempt, at, a, systematic, conquest, of, territory, but, manuel, s, army, defeated, the, turks, at, acro, nus, before, capturing, and, destroying, the, fortified, town, of, philomelion, removing, its, remaining, christian, population, the, byzantine, forces, reached, masud, s, capital, konya, iconium, and, ravaged, the, area, around, the, city, but, could, not, assault, its, walls, among, manuel, s, motives, for, mounting, this, razzia, there, included, a, wish, to, be, seen, in, the, west, as, actively, espousing, the, crusading, ideal, kinnamos, also, attributed, to, manuel, a, desire, to, show, off, his, martial, prowess, to, his, new, bride, while, on, this, campaign, manuel, received, a, letter, from, louis, vii, of, france, announcing, his, intention, of, leading, an, army, to, the, relief, of, the, crusader, states, manuel, was, prevented, from, capitalising, on, his, conquests, by, events, in, the, balkans, that, urgently, required, his, presence, in, 1147, he, granted, a, passage, through, his, dominions, to, two, armies, of, the, second, crusade, under, conrad, iii, of, germany, and, louis, vii, of, france, at, this, time, there, were, still, members, of, the, byzantine, court, who, remembered, the, passage, of, the, first, crusade, a, defining, event, in, the, collective, memory, of, the, age, that, had, fascinated, manuel, s, aunt, anna, komnene, many, byzantines, feared, the, crusade, a, view, endorsed, by, the, numerous, acts, of, vandalism, and, theft, practised, by, the, unruly, armies, as, they, marched, through, byzantine, territory, byzantine, troops, followed, the, crusaders, attempting, to, police, their, behaviour, and, further, troops, were, assembled, in, constantinople, ready, to, defend, the, capital, against, any, acts, of, aggression, this, cautious, approach, was, well, advised, but, still, the, numerous, incidents, of, covert, and, open, hostility, between, the, franks, and, the, greeks, on, their, line, of, march, for, which, it, seems, both, sides, were, to, blame, precipitated, conflict, between, manuel, and, his, guests, manuel, took, the, precaution, which, his, grandfather, had, not, taken, of, making, repairs, to, the, city, walls, and, he, pressed, the, two, kings, for, guarantees, concerning, the, security, of, his, territories, conrad, s, army, was, the, first, to, enter, the, byzantine, territory, in, the, summer, of, 1147, and, it, figures, more, prominently, in, the, byzantine, sources, which, imply, that, it, was, the, more, troublesome, of, the, two, indeed, the, contemporary, byzantine, historian, kinnamos, describes, a, full, scale, clash, between, a, byzantine, force, and, part, of, conrad, s, army, outside, the, walls, of, constantinople, the, byzantines, defeated, the, germans, and, in, byzantine, eyes, this, reverse, caused, conrad, to, agree, to, have, his, army, speedily, ferried, across, to, damalis, on, the, asian, shore, of, the, bosphoros, after, 1147, however, the, relations, between, the, two, leaders, became, friendlier, by, 1148, manuel, had, seen, the, wisdom, of, securing, an, alliance, with, conrad, whose, sister, in, law, bertha, of, sulzbach, he, had, earlier, married, he, actually, persuaded, the, german, king, to, renew, their, alliance, against, roger, ii, of, sicily, unfortunately, for, the, byzantine, emperor, conrad, died, in, 1152, and, despite, repeated, attempts, manuel, could, not, reach, an, agreement, with, his, successor, frederick, barbarossa, manuel, s, attention, was, again, drawn, to, antioch, in, 1156, when, raynald, of, ch, tillon, the, new, prince, of, antioch, claimed, that, the, byzantine, emperor, had, reneged, on, his, promise, to, pay, him, a, sum, of, money, and, vowed, to, attack, the, byzantine, province, of, cyprus, raynald, arrested, the, governor, of, the, island, john, komnenos, who, was, a, nephew, of, manuel, and, the, general, michael, branas, the, latin, historian, william, of, tyre, deplored, this, act, of, war, against, fellow, christians, and, described, the, atrocities, committed, by, raynald, s, men, in, considerable, detail, having, ransacked, the, island, and, plundered, all, its, wealth, raynald, s, army, mutilated, the, survivors, before, forcing, them, to, buy, back, their, flocks, at, exorbitant, prices, with, what, little, they, had, left, thus, enriched, with, enough, booty, to, make, antioch, wealthy, for, years, the, invaders, boarded, their, ships, and, set, sail, for, home, raynald, also, sent, some, of, the, mutilated, hostages, to, constantinople, as, a, vivid, demonstration, of, his, disobedience, and, his, contempt, for, the, byzantine, emperor, manuel, responded, to, this, outrage, in, a, characteristically, energetic, way, in, the, winter, of, 1158, 59, he, marched, to, cilicia, at, the, head, of, a, huge, army, the, speed, of, his, advance, manuel, had, hurried, on, ahead, of, the, main, army, with, 500, cavalry, was, such, that, he, managed, to, surprise, the, armenian, thoros, of, cilicia, who, had, participated, in, the, attack, on, cyprus, thoros, fled, into, the, mountains, and, cilicia, swiftly, fell, to, manuel, meanwhile, news, of, the, advance, of, the, byzantine, army, soon, reached, antioch, raynald, knew, that, he, had, no, hope, of, defeating, the, emperor, and, in, addition, knew, that, he, could, not, expect, any, aid, from, king, baldwin, iii, of, jerusalem, baldwin, did, not, approve, of, raynald, s, attack, on, cyprus, and, in, any, case, had, already, made, an, agreement, with, manuel, thus, isolated, and, abandoned, by, his, allies, raynald, decided, that, abject, submission, was, his, only, hope, he, appeared, dressed, in, a, sack, with, a, rope, tied, around, his, neck, and, begged, for, forgiveness, manuel, at, first, ignored, the, prostrate, raynald, chatting, with, his, courtiers, william, of, tyre, commented, that, this, ignominious, scene, continued, for, so, long, that, all, present, were, disgusted, by, it, eventually, manuel, forgave, raynald, on, condition, that, he, would, become, a, vassal, of, the, empire, effectively, surrendering, the, independence, of, antioch, to, byzantium, peace, having, been, restored, a, grand, ceremonial, procession, was, staged, on, 12, april, 1159, for, the, triumphant, entry, of, the, byzantine, army, into, the, city, with, manuel, riding, through, the, streets, on, horseback, while, the, prince, of, antioch, and, the, king, of, jerusalem, followed, on, foot, manuel, dispensed, justice, to, the, citizens, and, presided, over, games, and, tournaments, for, the, crowd, in, may, at, the, head, of, a, united, christian, army, he, started, on, the, road, to, edessa, but, he, abandoned, the, campaign, when, he, secured, the, release, by, nur, ad, din, the, ruler, of, syria, of, 6, 000, christian, prisoners, captured, in, various, battles, since, the, second, crusade, despite, the, glorious, end, of, the, expedition, modern, scholars, argue, that, manuel, ultimately, achieved, much, less, than, he, had, desired, in, terms, of, imperial, restoration, satisfied, with, his, efforts, thus, far, manuel, headed, back, to, constantinople, on, their, way, back, his, troops, were, surprised, in, line, of, march, by, the, turks, despite, this, they, won, a, complete, victory, routing, the, enemy, army, from, the, field, and, inflicting, heavy, losses, in, the, following, year, manuel, drove, the, turks, out, of, isauria, in, 1147, manuel, was, faced, with, war, by, roger, ii, of, sicily, whose, fleet, had, captured, the, byzantine, island, of, corfu, and, plundered, thebes, and, corinth, however, despite, being, distracted, by, a, cuman, attack, in, the, balkans, in, 1148, manuel, enlisted, the, alliance, of, conrad, iii, of, germany, and, the, help, of, the, venetians, who, quickly, defeated, roger, with, their, powerful, fleet, in, 1149, manuel, recovered, corfu, and, prepared, to, take, the, offensive, against, the, normans, while, roger, ii, sent, george, of, antioch, with, a, fleet, of, 40, ships, to, pillage, constantinople, s, suburbs, manuel, had, already, agreed, with, conrad, on, a, joint, invasion, and, partition, of, southern, italy, and, sicily, the, renewal, of, the, german, alliance, remained, the, principal, orientation, of, manuel, s, foreign, policy, for, the, rest, of, his, reign, despite, the, gradual, divergence, of, interests, between, the, two, empires, after, conrad, s, death, roger, died, in, february, 1154, and, was, succeeded, by, william, i, who, faced, widespread, rebellions, against, his, rule, in, sicily, and, apulia, leading, to, the, presence, of, apulian, refugees, at, the, byzantine, court, conrad, s, successor, frederick, barbarossa, launched, a, campaign, against, the, normans, but, his, expedition, stalled, these, developments, encouraged, manuel, to, take, advantage, of, the, multiple, instabilities, on, the, italian, peninsula, he, sent, michael, palaiologos, and, john, doukas, both, of, whom, held, the, high, imperial, rank, of, sebastos, with, byzantine, troops, ten, ships, and, large, quantities, of, gold, to, invade, apulia, in, 1155, the, two, generals, were, instructed, to, enlist, the, support, of, frederick, but, he, declined, because, his, demoralised, army, longed, to, get, back, north, of, the, alps, as, soon, as, possible, nevertheless, with, the, help, of, disaffected, local, barons, including, count, robert, of, loritello, manuel, s, expedition, achieved, astonishingly, rapid, progress, as, the, whole, of, southern, italy, rose, up, in, rebellion, against, the, sicilian, crown, and, the, untried, william, i, there, followed, a, string, of, spectacular, successes, as, numerous, strongholds, yielded, either, to, force, or, the, lure, of, gold, the, city, of, bari, which, had, been, the, capital, of, the, byzantine, catapanate, of, italy, for, centuries, before, the, arrival, of, the, normans, opened, its, gates, to, the, emperor, s, army, and, the, overjoyed, citizens, tore, down, the, norman, citadel, after, the, fall, of, bari, the, cities, of, trani, giovinazzo, andria, taranto, and, brindisi, were, also, captured, william, arrived, with, his, army, including, 2, 000, knights, but, was, heavily, defeated, encouraged, by, the, success, manuel, dreamed, of, restoration, of, the, roman, empire, at, the, cost, of, union, between, the, orthodox, and, the, catholic, church, a, prospect, which, would, frequently, be, offered, to, the, pope, during, negotiations, and, plans, for, alliance, if, there, was, ever, a, chance, of, reuniting, the, eastern, and, western, churches, and, coming, to, reconciliation, with, the, pope, permanently, this, was, probably, the, most, favourable, moment, the, papacy, was, never, on, good, terms, with, the, normans, except, when, under, duress, by, the, threat, of, direct, military, action, having, the, civilised, byzantines, on, its, southern, border, was, infinitely, preferable, to, the, papacy, than, having, to, constantly, deal, with, the, troublesome, normans, of, sicily, it, was, in, the, interest, of, pope, adrian, iv, to, reach, a, deal, if, at, all, possible, since, doing, so, would, greatly, increase, his, own, influence, over, the, entire, orthodox, christian, population, manuel, offered, a, large, sum, of, money, to, the, pope, for, the, provision, of, troops, with, the, request, that, the, pope, grant, the, byzantine, emperor, lordship, of, three, maritime, cities, in, return, for, assistance, in, expelling, william, from, sicily, manuel, also, promised, to, pay, 5, 000, pounds, of, gold, to, the, pope, and, the, curia, negotiations, were, hurriedly, carried, out, and, an, alliance, was, formed, between, manuel, and, hadrian, at, this, point, just, as, the, war, seemed, decided, in, his, favour, events, turned, against, manuel, byzantine, commander, michael, palaiologos, alienated, allies, with, his, attitude, stalling, the, campaign, as, count, robert, iii, of, loritello, refused, to, speak, to, him, although, the, two, were, reconciled, the, campaign, had, lost, some, of, its, momentum, michael, was, soon, recalled, to, constantinople, and, his, loss, was, a, major, blow, to, the, campaign, the, turning, point, was, the, battle, of, brindisi, where, the, normans, launched, a, major, counter, attack, by, both, land, and, sea, at, the, approach, of, the, enemy, the, mercenaries, that, had, been, hired, with, manuel, s, gold, demanded, huge, increases, in, their, pay, when, this, was, refused, they, deserted, even, the, local, barons, started, to, melt, away, and, soon, john, doukas, was, left, hopelessly, outnumbered, the, arrival, of, alexios, komnenos, bryennios, with, some, ships, failed, to, retrieve, the, byzantine, position, the, naval, battle, was, decided, in, favour, of, the, normans, while, john, doukas, and, alexios, bryennios, along, with, four, byzantine, ships, were, captured, manuel, then, sent, alexios, axouch, to, ancona, to, raise, another, army, but, by, this, time, william, had, already, retaken, all, of, the, byzantine, conquests, in, apulia, the, defeat, at, brindisi, put, an, end, to, the, restored, byzantine, reign, in, italy, in, 1158, the, byzantine, army, left, italy, and, never, returned, again, both, nicetas, choniates, and, kinnamos, the, major, byzantine, historians, of, this, period, agree, however, that, the, peace, terms, axouch, secured, from, william, allowed, manuel, to, extricate, himself, from, the, war, with, dignity, despite, a, devastating, raid, by, a, norman, fleet, of, 164, ships, carrying, 10, 000, men, on, euboea, and, almira, in, 1156, during, the, italian, campaign, and, afterwards, during, the, struggle, of, the, papal, curia, with, frederick, manuel, tried, to, sway, the, popes, with, hints, of, a, possible, union, between, the, eastern, and, western, churches, although, in, 1155, pope, adrian, iv, had, expressed, his, eagerness, to, prompt, the, reunion, of, the, churches, hopes, for, a, lasting, papal, byzantine, alliance, came, up, against, insuperable, problems, adrian, iv, and, his, successors, demanded, recognition, of, their, religious, authority, over, all, christians, everywhere, and, sought, superiority, over, the, byzantine, emperor, they, were, not, at, all, willing, to, fall, into, a, state, of, dependence, from, one, emperor, to, the, other, manuel, on, the, other, hand, wanted, an, official, recognition, of, his, secular, authority, over, both, east, and, west, such, conditions, would, not, be, accepted, by, either, side, even, if, a, pro, western, emperor, such, as, manuel, agreed, the, greek, citizens, of, the, empire, would, have, rejected, outright, any, union, of, this, sort, as, they, did, almost, three, hundred, years, later, when, the, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, were, briefly, united, under, the, pope, in, spite, of, his, friendliness, towards, the, roman, church, and, his, cordial, relations, with, all, the, popes, manuel, was, never, honoured, with, the, title, of, augustus, by, the, popes, and, although, he, twice, sent, embassies, to, pope, alexander, iii, in, 1167, and, 1169, offering, to, reunite, the, greek, and, latin, churches, alexander, refused, under, pretext, of, the, troubles, that, would, follow, union, the, final, results, of, the, italian, campaign, were, limited, in, terms, of, the, advantages, gained, by, the, empire, the, city, of, ancona, became, a, byzantine, base, in, italy, accepting, manuel, as, sovereign, the, normans, of, sicily, had, been, damaged, and, now, came, to, terms, with, the, empire, ensuring, peace, for, the, rest, of, manuel, s, reign, the, empire, s, ability, to, get, involved, in, italian, affairs, had, been, demonstrated, however, given, the, enormous, quantities, of, gold, which, had, been, lavished, on, the, project, it, also, demonstrated, the, limits, of, what, money, and, diplomacy, alone, could, achieve, the, expense, of, manuel, s, involvement, in, italy, must, have, cost, the, treasury, a, great, deal, probably, more, than, 2, 16, million, hyperpyra, or, 30, 000, pounds, of, gold, and, yet, it, produced, only, limited, solid, gains, after, 1158, under, the, new, conditions, the, aims, of, the, byzantine, policy, changed, manuel, now, decided, to, oppose, the, objective, of, the, hohenstaufen, dynasty, to, directly, annex, italy, which, frederick, believed, should, acknowledge, his, power, when, the, war, between, frederick, barbarossa, and, the, northern, italian, communes, started, manuel, actively, supported, the, lombard, league, with, money, subsidies, agents, and, occasionally, troops, the, walls, of, milan, demolished, by, the, germans, were, restored, with, manuel, s, aid, ancona, remained, important, as, a, centre, of, byzantine, influence, in, italy, the, anconitans, made, a, voluntary, submission, to, manuel, and, the, byzantines, maintained, representatives, in, the, city, frederick, s, defeat, at, the, battle, of, legnano, on, 29, may, 1176, seemed, rather, to, improve, manuel, s, position, in, italy, according, to, kinnamos, cremona, pavia, and, a, number, of, other, ligurian, cities, went, over, to, manuel, his, relations, were, also, particularly, favourable, in, regard, to, genoa, and, pisa, but, not, to, venice, in, march, 1171, manuel, had, suddenly, broken, with, venice, ordering, all, 20, 000, venetians, on, imperial, territory, to, be, arrested, and, their, property, confiscated, venice, incensed, sent, a, fleet, of, 120, ships, against, byzantium, due, to, an, epidemic, and, pursued, by, 150, byzantine, ships, the, fleet, was, forced, to, return, without, great, success, in, all, probability, friendly, relations, between, byzantium, and, venice, were, not, restored, in, manuel, s, lifetime, on, his, northern, frontier, manuel, expended, considerable, effort, to, preserve, the, conquests, made, by, basil, ii, over, one, hundred, years, earlier, and, maintained, sometimes, tenuously, ever, since, due, to, distraction, from, his, neighbours, on, the, balkan, frontier, manuel, was, kept, from, his, main, objective, the, subjugation, of, the, normans, of, sicily, relations, had, been, good, with, the, serbs, and, hungarians, since, 1129, so, the, serb, rebellion, came, as, a, shock, the, serbs, of, rascia, being, so, induced, by, roger, ii, of, sicily, invaded, byzantine, territory, in, 1149, manuel, forced, the, rebellious, serbs, and, their, leader, uro, ii, to, vassalage, 1150, 1152, he, then, made, repeated, attacks, upon, the, hungarians, with, a, view, to, annexing, their, territory, along, the, sava, in, the, wars, of, 1151, 1153, and, 1163, 1168, manuel, led, his, troops, into, hungary, and, a, spectacular, raid, deep, into, enemy, territory, yielded, substantial, war, booty, in, 1167, manuel, sent, 15, 000, men, under, the, command, of, andronikos, kontostephanos, against, the, hungarians, scoring, a, decisive, victory, at, the, battle, of, sirmium, and, enabling, the, empire, to, conclude, a, very, advantageous, peace, with, the, kingdom, of, hungary, by, which, syrmia, bosnia, and, dalmatia, were, ceded, by, 1168, nearly, the, whole, of, the, eastern, adriatic, coast, lay, in, manuel, s, hands, efforts, were, also, made, towards, a, diplomatic, annexation, of, hungary, the, hungarian, heir, b, la, younger, brother, of, the, hungarian, king, stephen, iii, was, sent, to, constantinople, to, be, educated, in, the, emperor, s, court, manuel, intended, the, youth, to, marry, his, daughter, maria, and, to, make, him, his, heir, thus, securing, the, union, of, hungary, with, the, empire, at, court, b, la, assumed, the, name, alexius, and, received, the, title, of, despot, which, had, previously, been, applied, only, to, the, emperor, himself, however, two, unforeseen, dynastic, events, drastically, altered, the, situation, in, 1169, manuel, s, young, wife, gave, birth, to, a, son, thus, depriving, b, la, of, his, status, as, heir, of, the, byzantine, throne, although, manuel, would, not, renounce, the, croatian, lands, he, had, taken, from, hungary, then, in, 1172, stephen, died, childless, and, b, la, went, home, to, take, his, throne, before, leaving, constantinople, he, swore, a, solemn, oath, to, manuel, that, he, would, always, keep, in, mind, the, interests, of, the, emperor, and, of, the, romans, b, la, iii, kept, his, word, as, long, as, manuel, lived, he, made, no, attempt, to, retrieve, his, croatian, inheritance, which, he, only, afterwards, reincorporated, into, hungary, manuel, komnenos, attempted, to, draw, the, russian, principalities, into, his, net, of, diplomacy, directed, against, hungary, and, to, a, lesser, extent, norman, sicily, this, polarised, the, russian, princes, into, pro, and, anti, byzantine, camps, in, the, late, 1140s, three, princes, were, competing, for, primacy, in, russia, prince, iziaslav, ii, of, kiev, was, related, to, g, za, ii, of, hungary, and, was, hostile, to, byzantium, prince, yuri, dolgoruki, of, suzdal, was, manuel, s, ally, symmachos, and, vladimirko, of, galicia, principality, of, halych, is, described, as, manuel, s, vassal, hypospondos, galicia, was, situated, on, the, northern, and, north, eastern, borders, of, hungary, and, therefore, was, of, great, strategic, importance, in, the, byzantine, hungarian, conflicts, following, the, deaths, of, both, iziaslav, and, vladimirko, the, situation, became, reversed, when, yuri, of, suzdal, manuel, s, ally, took, over, kiev, and, yaroslav, the, new, ruler, of, galicia, adopted, a, pro, hungarian, stance, in, 1164, 65, manuel, s, cousin, andronikos, the, future, emperor, escaped, from, captivity, in, byzantium, and, fled, to, the, court, of, yaroslav, in, galicia, this, situation, holding, out, the, alarming, prospect, of, andronikos, making, a, bid, for, manuel, s, throne, sponsored, by, both, galicia, and, hungary, spurred, the, byzantines, into, an, unprecedented, flurry, of, diplomacy, manuel, pardoned, andronikos, and, persuaded, him, to, return, to, constantinople, in, 1165, a, mission, to, kiev, then, ruled, by, prince, rostislav, resulted, in, a, favourable, treaty, and, a, pledge, to, supply, the, empire, with, auxiliary, troops, yaroslav, of, galicia, was, also, persuaded, to, renounce, his, hungarian, connections, and, return, fully, into, the, imperial, fold, as, late, as, 1200, the, princes, of, galicia, were, providing, invaluable, services, against, the, enemies, of, the, empire, at, that, time, the, cumans, the, restoration, of, relations, with, galicia, had, an, immediate, benefit, for, manuel, when, in, 1166, he, dispatched, two, armies, to, attack, the, eastern, provinces, of, hungary, in, a, vast, pincer, movement, one, army, crossed, the, walachian, plain, and, entered, hungary, through, the, transylvanian, alps, southern, carpathians, while, the, other, army, made, a, wide, circuit, to, galicia, and, with, galician, aid, crossed, the, carpathian, mountains, since, the, hungarians, had, most, of, their, forces, concentrated, on, the, sirmium, and, belgrade, frontier, they, were, caught, off, guard, by, the, byzantine, invasion, this, resulted, in, the, hungarian, province, of, transylvania, being, thoroughly, ravaged, by, the, byzantine, armies, control, of, egypt, was, a, decades, old, dream, of, the, crusader, kingdom, of, jerusalem, and, its, king, amalric, i, needed, all, the, military, and, financial, support, he, could, get, for, his, planned, campaign, amalric, also, realised, that, if, he, were, to, pursue, his, ambitions, in, egypt, he, might, have, to, leave, antioch, to, the, hegemony, of, manuel, who, had, paid, 100, 000, dinars, for, the, release, of, bohemond, iii, in, 1165, he, sent, envoys, to, the, byzantine, court, to, negotiate, a, marriage, alliance, manuel, had, already, married, amalric, s, cousin, maria, of, antioch, in, 1161, after, a, long, interval, of, two, years, amalric, married, manuel, s, grandniece, maria, komnene, in, 1167, and, swore, all, that, his, brother, baldwin, had, sworn, before, a, formal, alliance, was, negotiated, in, 1168, whereby, the, two, rulers, arranged, for, a, conquest, and, partition, of, egypt, with, manuel, taking, the, coastal, area, and, amalric, the, interior, in, the, autumn, of, 1169, manuel, sent, a, joint, expedition, with, amalric, to, egypt, a, byzantine, army, and, a, naval, force, of, 20, large, warships, 150, galleys, and, 60, transports, under, the, command, of, the, megas, doux, andronikos, kontostephanos, joined, forces, with, amalric, at, ascalon, william, of, tyre, who, negotiated, the, alliance, was, impressed, in, particular, by, the, large, transport, ships, that, were, used, to, transport, the, cavalry, forces, of, the, army, although, such, a, long, range, attack, on, a, state, far, from, the, centre, of, the, empire, may, seem, extraordinary, the, last, time, the, empire, had, attempted, anything, on, this, scale, was, the, failed, invasion, of, sicily, over, one, hundred, and, twenty, years, earlier, it, can, be, explained, in, terms, of, manuel, s, foreign, policy, which, was, to, use, the, latins, to, ensure, the, survival, of, the, empire, this, focus, on, the, bigger, picture, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, even, further, afield, thus, led, manuel, to, intervene, in, egypt, it, was, believed, that, in, the, context, of, the, wider, struggle, between, the, crusader, states, and, the, islamic, powers, of, the, east, control, of, egypt, would, be, the, deciding, factor, it, had, become, clear, that, the, ailing, fatimid, caliphate, of, egypt, held, the, key, to, the, fate, of, the, crusader, states, if, egypt, came, out, of, its, isolation, and, joined, forces, with, the, muslims, under, nur, ad, din, the, crusader, cause, was, in, trouble, a, successful, invasion, of, egypt, would, have, several, further, advantages, for, the, byzantine, empire, egypt, was, a, rich, province, and, in, the, days, of, the, roman, empire, it, had, supplied, much, of, the, grain, for, constantinople, before, it, was, lost, to, the, arabs, in, the, 7th, century, the, revenues, that, the, empire, could, have, expected, to, gain, from, the, conquest, of, egypt, would, have, been, considerable, even, if, these, would, have, to, be, shared, with, the, crusaders, furthermore, manuel, may, have, wanted, to, encourage, amalric, s, plans, not, only, to, deflect, the, ambitions, of, the, latins, away, from, antioch, but, also, to, create, new, opportunities, for, joint, military, ventures, that, would, keep, the, king, of, jerusalem, in, his, debt, and, would, also, allow, the, empire, to, share, in, territorial, gains, the, joined, forces, of, manuel, and, amalric, laid, siege, to, damietta, on, 27, october, 1169, but, the, siege, was, unsuccessful, due, to, the, failure, of, the, crusaders, and, the, byzantines, to, co, operate, fully, according, to, byzantine, forces, amalric, not, wanting, to, share, the, profits, of, victory, dragged, out, the, operation, until, the, emperor, s, men, ran, short, of, provisions, and, were, particularly, affected, by, famine, amalric, then, launched, an, assault, which, he, promptly, aborted, by, negotiating, a, truce, with, the, defenders, on, the, other, hand, william, of, tyre, remarked, that, the, greeks, were, not, entirely, blameless, whatever, the, truth, of, the, allegations, of, both, sides, when, the, rains, came, both, the, latin, army, and, the, byzantine, fleet, returned, home, although, half, of, the, byzantine, fleet, was, lost, in, a, sudden, storm, despite, the, bad, feelings, generated, at, damietta, amalric, still, refused, to, abandon, his, dream, of, conquering, egypt, and, he, continued, to, seek, good, relations, with, the, byzantines, in, the, hopes, of, another, joined, attack, which, never, took, place, in, 1171, amalric, came, to, constantinople, in, person, after, egypt, had, fallen, to, saladin, manuel, was, thus, able, to, organise, a, grand, ceremonial, reception, which, both, honoured, amalric, and, underlined, his, dependence, for, the, rest, of, amalric, s, reign, jerusalem, was, a, byzantine, satellite, and, manuel, was, able, to, act, as, a, protector, of, the, holy, places, exerting, a, growing, influence, in, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, in, 1177, a, fleet, of, 150, ships, was, sent, by, manuel, i, to, invade, egypt, but, returned, home, after, appearing, off, acre, due, to, the, refusal, of, count, philip, of, flanders, and, many, important, nobles, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, to, help, between, 1158, and, 1162, a, series, of, byzantine, campaigns, against, the, seljuk, turks, of, the, sultanate, of, r, m, resulted, in, a, treaty, favourable, to, the, empire, according, to, the, agreement, certain, frontier, regions, including, the, city, of, sebasteia, should, be, handed, over, to, manuel, in, return, for, some, quantity, of, cash, while, it, also, obliged, the, seljuk, sultan, kilij, arslan, ii, to, recognize, his, overlordship, kilij, arslan, ii, used, the, peace, with, byzantium, and, the, power, vacuum, caused, by, the, death, in, 1174, of, nur, ad, din, zangi, the, ruler, of, syria, to, expel, the, danishmends, from, their, anatolian, emirates, when, the, seljuk, sultan, refused, to, cede, some, of, the, territory, he, had, taken, from, the, danishmends, to, the, byzantines, as, he, was, obliged, to, do, as, part, of, his, treaty, obligations, manuel, decided, that, it, was, time, to, deal, with, the, turks, once, and, for, all, therefore, he, assembled, the, full, imperial, army, and, marched, against, the, seljuk, capital, iconium, konya, manuel, s, strategy, was, to, prepare, the, advanced, bases, of, dorylaeum, and, sublaeum, and, then, to, use, them, to, strike, as, quickly, as, possible, at, iconium, yet, manuel, s, army, of, 35, 000, men, was, large, and, unwieldy, according, to, a, letter, that, manuel, sent, to, king, henry, ii, of, england, the, advancing, column, was, ten, miles, 16, km, long, manuel, marched, against, iconium, via, laodicea, chonae, lampe, celaenae, choma, and, antioch, just, outside, the, entrance, to, the, pass, at, myriokephalon, manuel, was, met, by, turkish, ambassadors, who, offered, peace, on, generous, terms, most, of, manuel, s, generals, and, experienced, courtiers, urged, him, to, accept, the, offer, the, younger, and, more, aggressive, members, of, the, court, urged, manuel, to, attack, however, and, he, took, their, advice, and, continued, his, advance, manuel, made, serious, tactical, errors, such, as, failing, to, properly, scout, out, the, route, ahead, these, failings, caused, him, to, lead, his, forces, straight, into, a, classic, ambush, on, 17, september, 1176, manuel, was, checked, by, seljuk, sultan, kilij, arslan, ii, at, the, battle, of, myriokephalon, in, highlands, near, the, tzibritze, pass, in, which, his, army, was, ambushed, while, marching, through, the, narrow, mountain, pass, the, byzantines, were, hemmed, in, by, the, narrowness, of, the, pass, which, allowed, the, seljuks, to, concentrate, their, attacks, on, part, of, the, byzantine, army, especially, the, baggage, and, siege, train, without, the, rest, being, able, to, intervene, the, army, s, siege, equipment, was, quickly, destroyed, and, manuel, was, forced, to, withdraw, without, siege, engines, the, conquest, of, iconium, was, impossible, according, to, byzantine, sources, manuel, lost, his, nerve, both, during, and, after, the, battle, fluctuating, between, extremes, of, self, delusion, and, self, abasement, according, to, william, of, tyre, he, was, never, the, same, again, the, terms, by, which, kilij, arslan, ii, allowed, manuel, and, his, army, to, leave, were, that, he, should, remove, his, frontier, forts, and, garrisons, at, dorylaeum, and, sublaeum, since, the, sultan, had, already, failed, to, keep, his, side, of, the, earlier, treaty, of, 1162, however, manuel, only, ordered, the, fortifications, of, sublaeum, to, be, dismantled, but, not, the, fortifications, of, dorylaeum, nevertheless, defeat, at, myriokephalon, was, an, embarrassment, for, both, manuel, personally, and, also, for, his, empire, the, komnenian, emperors, had, worked, hard, since, the, battle, of, manzikert, over, a, century, earlier, to, restore, the, reputation, of, the, empire, yet, because, of, his, overconfidence, manuel, had, demonstrated, to, the, world, that, byzantium, still, could, not, decisively, defeat, the, seljuks, despite, the, advances, made, during, the, past, century, in, western, opinion, myriokephalon, cut, manuel, down, to, a, humbler, size, not, that, of, emperor, of, the, romans, but, that, of, king, of, the, greeks, the, defeat, at, myriokephalon, has, often, been, depicted, as, a, catastrophe, in, which, the, entire, byzantine, army, was, destroyed, manuel, himself, compared, the, defeat, to, manzikert, it, seemed, to, him, that, the, byzantine, defeat, at, myriokephalon, complemented, the, destruction, at, manzikert, in, reality, although, a, defeat, it, was, not, particularly, costly, and, did, not, significantly, diminish, the, fighting, ability, of, the, byzantine, army, most, of, the, casualties, were, borne, by, the, right, wing, largely, composed, of, allied, troops, commanded, by, baldwin, of, antioch, and, also, by, the, baggage, train, which, was, the, main, target, of, the, turkish, ambush, the, limited, losses, inflicted, on, native, byzantine, troops, were, quickly, recovered, and, in, the, following, year, manuel, s, forces, defeated, a, force, of, picked, turks, john, komnenos, vatatzes, who, was, sent, by, the, emperor, to, repel, the, turkish, invasion, not, only, brought, troops, from, the, capital, but, also, was, able, to, gather, an, army, along, the, way, vatatzes, caught, the, turks, in, an, ambush, as, they, were, crossing, the, meander, river, the, subsequent, battle, of, hyelion, and, leimocheir, effectively, destroyed, them, as, a, fighting, force, this, is, an, indication, that, the, byzantine, army, remained, strong, and, that, the, defensive, program, of, western, asia, minor, was, still, successful, after, the, victory, on, the, meander, manuel, himself, advanced, with, a, small, army, to, drive, the, turks, from, panasium, south, of, cotyaeum, in, 1178, however, a, byzantine, army, retreated, after, encountering, a, turkish, force, at, charax, allowing, the, turks, to, capture, many, livestock, the, city, of, claudiopolis, in, bithynia, was, besieged, by, the, turks, in, 1179, forcing, manuel, to, lead, a, small, cavalry, force, to, save, the, city, and, then, even, as, late, as, 1180, the, byzantines, succeeded, in, scoring, a, victory, over, the, turks, the, continuous, warfare, had, a, serious, effect, upon, manuel, s, vitality, he, declined, in, health, and, in, 1180, succumbed, to, a, slow, fever, furthermore, like, manzikert, the, balance, between, the, two, powers, began, to, gradually, shift, manuel, never, again, attacked, the, turks, and, after, his, death, they, began, to, move, further, west, deeper, into, byzantine, territory, three, major, theological, controversies, occurred, during, manuel, s, reign, in, 1156, 1157, the, question, was, raised, whether, christ, had, offered, himself, as, a, sacrifice, for, the, sins, of, the, world, to, the, father, and, to, the, holy, spirit, only, or, also, to, the, logos, i, e, to, himself, in, the, end, a, synod, held, at, constantinople, in, 1157, declared, the, doctrine, of, a, single, sacrifice, to, the, holy, trinity, producing, a, formula, the, precious, blood, of, the, only, begotten, was, offered, not, only, to, the, father, but, also, to, the, son, and, the, holy, ghost, the, one, godhead, despite, the, dissent, of, patriarch, of, antioch, elect, soterichos, panteugenos, who, was, subsequently, dismissed, ten, years, later, a, controversy, arose, as, to, whether, the, saying, of, christ, my, father, is, greater, than, i, referred, to, his, divine, nature, to, his, human, nature, or, to, the, union, of, the, two, demetrius, of, lampe, a, byzantine, diplomat, recently, returned, from, the, west, ridiculed, the, way, the, verse, was, interpreted, there, that, christ, was, inferior, to, his, father, in, his, humanity, but, equal, in, his, divinity, manuel, on, the, other, hand, perhaps, with, an, eye, on, the, project, for, church, union, found, that, the, formula, made, sense, and, prevailed, over, a, majority, in, a, synod, convened, on, 2, march, 1166, to, decide, the, issue, where, he, had, the, support, of, the, patriarch, luke, chrysoberges, and, later, patriarch, michael, iii, those, who, refused, to, submit, to, the, synod, s, decisions, had, their, property, confiscated, or, were, exiled, the, political, dimensions, of, this, controversy, are, apparent, from, the, fact, that, a, leading, dissenter, from, the, emperor, s, doctrine, was, his, nephew, alexios, kontostephanos, a, third, controversy, sprung, up, in, 1180, when, manuel, objected, to, the, formula, of, solemn, abjuration, which, was, exacted, from, muslim, converts, one, of, the, more, striking, anathemas, of, this, abjuration, was, that, directed, against, the, deity, worshipped, by, muhammad, and, his, followers, and, before, all, i, anathematize, the, god, of, muhammad, about, whom, he, says, he, is, god, alone, god, made, of, solid, hammer, beaten, metal, he, begets, not, and, is, not, begotten, nor, is, there, like, unto, him, any, one, the, emperor, ordered, the, deletion, of, this, anathema, from, the, church, s, catechetical, texts, a, measure, that, provoked, vehement, opposition, from, both, the, patriarch, and, bishops, manuel, is, representative, of, a, new, kind, of, byzantine, ruler, who, was, influenced, by, his, contact, with, western, crusaders, he, arranged, jousting, matches, even, participating, in, them, an, unusual, and, discomforting, sight, for, the, byzantines, endowed, with, a, fine, physique, manuel, has, been, the, subject, of, exaggeration, in, the, byzantine, sources, of, his, era, where, he, is, presented, as, a, man, of, great, personal, courage, according, to, the, story, of, his, exploits, which, appear, as, a, model, or, a, copy, of, the, romances, of, chivalry, such, was, his, strength, and, exercise, in, arms, that, raymond, of, antioch, was, incapable, of, wielding, his, lance, and, buckler, in, a, famous, tournament, he, is, said, to, have, entered, the, lists, on, a, fiery, courser, and, to, have, overturned, two, of, the, stoutest, italian, knights, in, one, day, he, is, said, to, have, slain, forty, turks, with, his, own, hand, and, in, a, battle, against, the, hungarians, he, allegedly, snatched, a, banner, and, was, the, first, almost, alone, who, passed, a, bridge, that, separated, his, army, from, the, enemy, on, another, occasion, he, is, said, to, have, cut, his, way, through, a, squadron, of, five, hundred, turks, without, receiving, a, wound, he, had, previously, posted, an, ambuscade, in, a, wood, and, was, accompanied, only, by, his, brother, and, axouch, manuel, had, two, wives, his, first, marriage, in, 1146, was, to, bertha, of, sulzbach, a, sister, in, law, of, conrad, iii, of, germany, she, died, in, 1159, children, manuel, s, second, marriage, was, to, maria, of, antioch, nicknamed, xene, a, daughter, of, raymond, and, constance, of, antioch, in, 1161, by, this, marriage, manuel, had, one, son, manuel, had, several, illegitimate, children, by, theodora, vatatzina, by, maria, taronitissa, the, wife, of, john, doukas, komnenos, by, other, lovers, as, a, young, man, manuel, had, been, determined, to, restore, by, force, of, arms, the, predominance, of, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, mediterranean, countries, by, the, time, he, died, in, 1180, 37, years, had, passed, since, that, momentous, day, in, 1143, when, amid, the, wilds, of, cilicia, his, father, had, proclaimed, him, emperor, these, years, had, seen, manuel, involved, in, conflict, with, his, neighbours, on, all, sides, manuel, s, father, and, grandfather, before, him, had, worked, patiently, to, undo, the, damage, done, by, the, battle, of, manzikert, and, its, aftermath, thanks, to, their, efforts, the, empire, manuel, inherited, was, stronger, and, better, organised, than, at, any, time, for, a, century, while, it, is, clear, that, manuel, used, these, assets, to, the, full, it, is, not, so, clear, how, much, he, added, to, them, and, there, is, room, for, doubt, as, to, whether, he, used, them, to, best, effect, manuel, had, proven, himself, to, be, an, energetic, emperor, who, saw, possibilities, everywhere, and, whose, optimistic, outlook, had, shaped, his, approach, to, foreign, policy, however, in, spite, of, his, military, prowess, manuel, achieved, but, a, slight, degree, of, his, object, of, restoring, the, byzantine, empire, retrospectively, some, commentators, have, criticised, some, of, manuel, s, aims, as, unrealistic, in, particular, citing, the, expeditions, he, sent, to, egypt, as, proof, of, dreams, of, grandeur, on, an, unattainable, scale, his, greatest, military, campaign, his, grand, expedition, against, the, turkish, sultanate, of, iconium, ended, in, humiliating, defeat, and, his, greatest, diplomatic, effort, apparently, collapsed, when, pope, alexander, iii, became, reconciled, to, the, german, emperor, frederick, barbarossa, at, the, peace, of, venice, historian, mark, c, bartusis, argues, that, manuel, and, his, father, as, well, tried, to, rebuild, a, national, army, but, his, reforms, were, adequate, for, neither, his, ambitions, nor, his, needs, the, defeat, at, myriokephalon, underscored, the, fundamental, weakness, of, his, policies, according, to, edward, gibbon, manuel, s, victories, were, not, productive, of, any, permanent, or, useful, conquest, his, advisors, on, western, church, affairs, included, the, pisan, scholar, hugh, eteriano, choniates, criticised, manuel, for, raising, taxes, and, pointed, to, manuel, s, reign, as, a, period, of, excess, according, to, choniates, the, money, thus, raised, was, spent, lavishly, at, the, cost, of, his, citizens, whether, one, reads, the, greek, encomiastic, sources, or, the, latin, and, oriental, sources, the, impression, is, consistent, with, choniates, picture, of, an, emperor, who, spent, lavishly, in, all, available, ways, rarely, economising, in, one, sector, in, order, to, develop, another, manuel, spared, no, expense, on, the, army, the, navy, diplomacy, ceremonial, palace, building, the, komnenian, family, and, other, seekers, of, patronage, a, significant, amount, of, this, expenditure, was, pure, financial, loss, to, the, empire, like, the, subsidies, poured, into, italy, and, the, crusader, states, and, the, sums, spent, on, the, failed, expeditions, of, 1155, 1156, 1169, and, 1176, the, problems, this, created, were, counterbalanced, to, some, extent, by, his, successes, particularly, in, the, balkans, manuel, extended, the, frontiers, of, his, empire, in, the, balkan, region, ensuring, security, for, the, whole, of, greece, and, bulgaria, had, he, been, more, successful, in, all, his, ventures, he, would, have, controlled, not, only, the, most, productive, farmland, around, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, adriatic, seas, but, also, the, entire, trading, facilities, of, the, area, even, if, he, did, not, achieve, his, ambitious, goals, his, wars, against, hungary, 1149, 1155, 1162, 1167, brought, him, control, of, the, dalmatian, coast, the, rich, agricultural, region, of, sirmium, and, the, danube, trade, route, from, hungary, to, the, black, sea, his, balkan, expeditions, are, said, to, have, taken, great, booty, in, slaves, and, livestock, kinnamos, was, impressed, by, the, amount, of, arms, taken, from, the, hungarian, dead, after, the, battle, of, 1167, and, even, if, manuel, s, wars, against, the, turks, probably, realised, a, net, loss, his, commanders, took, livestock, and, captives, on, at, least, two, occasions, this, allowed, the, western, provinces, to, flourish, in, an, economic, revival, that, had, begun, in, the, time, of, his, grandfather, alexios, i, and, continued, till, the, close, of, the, century, indeed, it, has, been, argued, that, byzantium, in, the, 12th, century, was, richer, and, more, prosperous, than, at, any, time, since, the, persian, invasion, during, the, reign, of, herakleios, some, five, hundred, years, earlier, there, is, good, evidence, from, this, period, of, new, construction, and, new, churches, even, in, remote, areas, strongly, suggesting, that, wealth, was, widespread, trade, was, also, flourishing, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, population, of, constantinople, the, biggest, commercial, centre, of, the, empire, was, between, half, a, million, and, one, million, during, manuel, s, reign, making, it, by, far, the, largest, city, in, europe, a, major, source, of, manuel, s, wealth, was, the, kommerkion, a, customs, duty, levied, at, constantinople, on, all, imports, and, exports, the, kommerkion, was, stated, to, have, collected, 20, 000, hyperpyra, each, day, furthermore, constantinople, was, undergoing, expansion, the, cosmopolitan, character, of, the, city, was, being, reinforced, by, the, arrival, of, italian, merchants, and, crusaders, en, route, to, the, holy, land, the, venetians, the, genoese, and, others, opened, up, the, ports, of, the, aegean, to, commerce, shipping, goods, from, the, crusader, kingdoms, of, outremer, and, fatimid, egypt, to, the, west, and, trading, with, byzantium, via, constantinople, these, maritime, traders, stimulated, demand, in, the, towns, and, cities, of, greece, macedonia, and, the, greek, islands, generating, new, sources, of, wealth, in, a, predominantly, agrarian, economy, thessalonica, the, second, city, of, the, empire, hosted, a, famous, summer, fair, that, attracted, traders, from, across, the, balkans, and, even, further, afield, to, its, bustling, market, stalls, in, corinth, silk, production, fuelled, a, thriving, economy, all, this, is, a, testament, to, the, success, of, the, komnenian, emperors, in, securing, a, pax, byzantina, in, these, heartland, territories, to, the, rhetors, of, his, court, manuel, was, the, divine, emperor, a, generation, after, his, death, choniates, referred, to, him, as, the, most, blessed, among, emperors, and, a, century, later, john, stavrakios, described, him, as, great, in, fine, deeds, john, phokas, a, soldier, who, fought, in, manuel, s, army, characterised, him, some, years, later, as, the, world, saving, and, glorious, emperor, manuel, would, be, remembered, in, france, italy, and, the, crusader, states, as, the, most, powerful, sovereign, in, the, world, a, genoese, analyst, noted, that, with, the, passing, of, lord, manuel, of, divine, memory, the, most, blessed, emperor, of, constantinople, all, christendom, incurred, great, ruin, and, detriment, william, of, tyre, called, manuel, a, wise, and, discreet, prince, of, great, magnificence, worthy, of, praise, in, every, respect, a, great, souled, man, of, incomparable, energy, whose, memory, will, ever, be, held, in, benediction, manuel, was, further, extolled, by, robert, of, clari, as, a, right, worthy, man, and, richest, of, all, the, christians, who, ever, were, and, the, most, bountiful, a, telling, reminder, of, the, influence, that, manuel, held, in, the, crusader, states, in, particular, can, still, be, seen, in, the, church, of, the, holy, nativity, in, bethlehem, in, the, 1160s, the, nave, was, redecorated, with, mosaics, showing, the, councils, of, the, church, manuel, was, one, of, the, patrons, of, the, work, on, the, south, wall, an, inscription, in, greek, reads, the, present, work, was, finished, by, ephraim, the, monk, painter, and, mosaicist, in, the, reign, of, the, great, emperor, manuel, porphyrogennetos, komnenos, and, in, the, time, of, the, great, king, of, jerusalem, amalric, that, manuel, s, name, was, placed, first, was, a, symbolic, public, recognition, of, manuel, s, overlordship, as, leader, of, the, christian, world, manuel, s, role, as, protector, of, the, orthodox, christians, and, christian, holy, places, in, general, is, also, evident, in, his, successful, attempts, to, secure, rights, over, the, holy, land, manuel, participated, in, the, building, and, decorating, of, many, of, the, basilicas, and, greek, monasteries, in, the, holy, land, including, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, where, thanks, to, his, efforts, the, byzantine, clergy, were, allowed, to, perform, the, greek, liturgy, each, day, all, this, reinforced, his, position, as, overlord, of, the, crusader, states, with, his, hegemony, over, antioch, and, jerusalem, secured, by, agreement, with, raynald, prince, of, antioch, and, amalric, king, of, jerusalem, respectively, manuel, was, also, the, last, byzantine, emperor, who, thanks, to, his, military, and, diplomatic, success, in, the, balkans, could, call, himself, ruler, of, dalmatia, bosnia, croatia, serbia, bulgaria, and, hungary, manuel, died, on, 24, september, 1180, having, just, celebrated, the, betrothal, of, his, son, alexios, ii, to, the, daughter, of, the, king, of, france, he, was, laid, to, rest, alongside, his, father, in, the, pantokrator, monastery, in, constantinople, thanks, to, the, diplomacy, and, campaigning, of, alexios, john, and, manuel, the, empire, was, a, great, power, economically, prosperous, and, secure, on, its, frontiers, but, there, were, serious, problems, as, well, internally, the, byzantine, court, required, a, strong, leader, to, hold, it, together, and, after, manuel, s, death, stability, was, seriously, endangered, from, within, some, of, the, foreign, enemies, of, the, empire, were, lurking, on, the, flanks, waiting, for, a, chance, to, attack, in, particular, the, turks, in, anatolia, whom, manuel, had, ultimately, failed, to, defeat, and, the, normans, in, sicily, who, had, already, tried, but, failed, to, invade, the, empire, on, several, occasions, even, the, venetians, the, single, most, important, western, ally, of, byzantium, were, on, bad, terms, with, the, empire, at, manuel, s, death, in, 1180, given, this, situation, it, would, have, taken, a, strong, emperor, to, secure, the, empire, against, the, foreign, threats, it, now, faced, and, to, rebuild, the, depleted, imperial, treasury, but, manuel, s, son, was, a, minor, and, his, unpopular, regency, government, was, overthrown, in, a, violent, coup, d, tat, this, troubled, succession, weakened, the, dynastic, continuity, and, solidarity, on, which, the, strength, of, the, byzantine, state, had, come, to, rely, a, the, mood, that, prevailed, before, the, end, of, 1147, is, best, conveyed, by, a, verse, encomium, to, manuel, one, of, the, poems, included, in, a, list, transmitted, under, the, name, of, theodore, prodromos, in, codex, marcianus, graecus, xi, 22, known, as, manganeios, prodromos, which, was, probably, an, imperial, commission, and, must, have, been, written, shortly, after, the, germans, had, crossed, the, bosporus, here, conrad, is, accused, of, wanting, to, take, constantinople, by, force, and, to, install, a, latin, patriarch, manganeios, prodromos, no, 20, 1, b, according, to, paul, magdalino, one, of, manuel, s, primary, goals, was, a, partition, of, italy, with, the, german, empire, in, which, byzantium, would, get, the, adriatic, coast, his, unilateral, pursuit, however, antagonized, the, new, german, emperor, frederick, barbarossa, whose, own, plans, for, imperial, restoration, ruled, out, any, partnership, with, byzantium, manuel, was, thus, obliged, to, treat, frederick, as, his, main, enemy, and, to, form, a, web, of, relationships, with, other, western, powers, including, the, papacy, his, old, enemy, the, norman, kingdom, hungary, several, magnates, and, cities, throughout, italy, and, above, all, the, crusader, states, c, magdalino, underscores, that, whereas, john, had, removed, the, rupenid, princes, from, power, in, cilicia, twenty, years, earlier, manuel, allowed, toros, to, hold, most, of, his, strongholds, he, had, taken, and, effectively, restored, only, the, coastal, area, to, imperial, rule, from, raynald, manuel, secured, recognition, of, imperial, suzerainty, over, antioch, with, the, promise, to, hand, over, the, citadel, to, instal, a, patriarch, sent, from, constantinople, not, actually, implemented, until, 1165, 66, and, to, provide, troops, for, the, emperor, s, service, but, nothing, seems, to, have, been, said, about, the, reversion, of, antioch, to, direct, imperial, rule, according, to, magdalino, this, suggests, that, manuel, had, dropped, this, demand, on, which, both, his, grandfather, and, father, insisted, for, his, part, historian, zachary, nugent, brooke, believes, that, the, victory, of, christianity, against, nur, ad, din, was, made, impossible, since, both, greeks, and, latins, were, concerned, primarily, with, their, own, interests, he, characterises, the, policy, of, manuel, as, short, sighted, because, he, lost, a, splendid, opportunity, of, recovering, the, former, possessions, of, the, empire, and, by, his, departure, threw, away, most, of, the, actual, fruits, of, his, expedition, according, to, piers, paul, read, manuel, s, deal, with, nur, ad, din, was, for, the, latins, another, expression, of, greeks, perfidy, d, alexios, had, been, ordered, to, bring, soldiers, but, he, merely, brought, his, empty, ships, to, brindisi, e, in, 1155, hadrian, sent, legates, to, manuel, with, a, letter, for, basil, archbishop, of, thessaloniki, in, which, he, exhorted, that, bishop, to, procure, the, re, nion, of, the, churches, basil, answered, that, there, was, no, division, between, the, greeks, and, latins, since, they, held, the, same, faith, and, offered, the, same, sacrifice, as, for, the, causes, of, scandal, weak, in, themselves, that, have, separated, us, from, each, other, he, added, your, holiness, can, cause, them, to, cease, by, your, own, extended, authority, and, the, help, of, the, emperor, of, the, west, f, this, probably, meant, that, amalric, repeated, baldwin, s, assurances, regarding, the, status, of, antioch, as, an, imperial, fief, g, according, to, michael, angold, after, the, controversy, of, 1166, manuel, took, his, responsibilities, very, seriously, and, tightened, his, grip, over, the, church, 1166, was, also, the, year, in, which, manuel, first, referred, in, his, legislation, to, his, role, as, the, disciplinarian, of, the, church, epistemonarkhes
