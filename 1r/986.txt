the, religious, innovations, he, saw, take, place, there, ibn, taymiyya, represented, the, hanbali, school, of, thought, during, this, time, the, hanbali, school, was, seen, as, the, most,

time, however, there, is, no, evidence, any, of, them, had, a, significant, influence, on, him, a, strong, influence, on, ibn, taymiyya, was, the, founder, of, the, hanbali, school, itself, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, ibn, taymiyya, was, trained, in, his, school, by, studying, ahmad, s, musnad, in, great, detail, having, studied, it, multiple, times, though, he, spent, much, of, his, life, following, this, school, he, renounced, blind, following, near, the, end, of, his, life, his, work, was, most, influenced, by, the, sayings, and, actions, of, the, first, three, generations, of, muslims, salaf, which, is, displayed, in, his, works, where, he, would, give, preference, to, their, opinions, over, those, of, his, contemporaries, the, modern, salafi, movement, derives, its, name, from, these, generations, ibn, taymiyya, s, own, relationship, as, a, religious, scholar, with, the, ruling, apparatus, was, not, always, amicable, it, ranged, from, silence, to, open, rebellion, on, occasions, when, he, shared, the, same, views, and, aims, as, the, ruling, authorities, his, contributions, were, welcomed, but, when, ibn, taymiyya, went, against, the, status, quo, he, was, seen, as, uncooperative, and, on, occasions, spent, much, time, in, prison, ibn, taymiyya, s, attitude, towards, his, own, rulers, was, based, on, the, actions, of, muhammad, s, companions, when, they, made, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, him, as, follows, to, obey, within, obedience, to, god, even, if, the, one, giving, the, order, is, unjust, to, abstain, from, disputing, the, authority, of, those, who, exert, it, and, to, speak, out, the, truth, or, take, up, its, cause, without, fear, in, respect, of, god, of, blame, from, anyone, ibn, taymiyya, was, a, religious, scholar, as, well, as, an, islamic, political, activist, in, his, efforts, he, was, persecuted, and, imprisoned, on, six, occasions, with, the, total, time, spent, inside, prison, coming, to, over, six, years, other, sources, say, that, he, spent, over, twelve, years, in, prison, his, detentions, were, due, to, the, pushback, from, the, clerical, establishment, of, the, mamluk, sultanate, who, opposed, certain, elements, of, his, creed, and, his, views, on, some, jurisprudential, issues, however, according, to, yahya, michot, the, real, reasons, were, more, trivial, michot, stated, five, reasons, as, to, why, ibn, taymiyya, was, imprisoned, by, the, mamluk, government, they, being, not, complying, with, the, doctrines, and, practices, prevalent, among, powerful, religious, and, sufi, establishments, an, overly, outspoken, personality, the, jealousy, of, his, peers, the, risk, to, public, order, due, to, this, popular, appeal, and, political, intrigues, baber, johansen, stated, that, the, reasons, for, ibn, taymiyya, s, incarcerations, were, as, a, result, of, his, conflicts, with, muslim, mystics, jurists, and, theologians, who, were, able, to, persuade, the, political, authorities, of, the, necessity, to, limit, ibn, taymiyya, s, range, of, action, through, political, censorship, and, incarceration, ibn, taymiyya, s, emergence, in, the, public, and, political, spheres, began, in, 1293, when, he, was, 30, years, old, when, the, authorities, asked, him, to, issue, a, fatwa, legal, verdict, on, assaf, al, nasrani, a, christian, cleric, who, was, accused, of, insulting, muhammad, he, accepted, the, invitation, and, delivered, his, fatwa, calling, for, the, man, to, receive, the, death, penalty, despite, the, fact, that, public, opinion, was, very, much, on, ibn, taymiyya, s, side, the, governor, of, syria, attempted, to, resolve, the, situation, by, asking, assaf, to, accept, islam, in, return, for, his, life, to, which, he, agreed, this, resolution, was, not, acceptable, to, ibn, taymiyya, who, then, together, with, his, followers, protested, against, it, outside, the, governor, s, palace, demanding, that, assaf, be, put, to, death, on, the, grounds, that, any, person, muslim, or, non, muslim, who, insults, muhammad, must, be, killed, his, unwillingness, to, compromise, coupled, with, his, attempt, to, protest, against, the, governor, s, actions, resulted, in, him, being, punished, with, a, prison, sentence, the, first, of, many, such, imprisonments, which, were, to, come, the, french, orientalist, henri, laoust, says, that, during, his, incarceration, ibn, taymiyya, wrote, his, first, great, work, al, rim, al, masl, l, al, sh, tim, al, ras, l, the, drawn, sword, against, those, who, insult, the, messenger, ibn, taymiyya, together, with, the, help, of, his, disciples, continued, with, his, efforts, against, what, he, perceived, to, be, un, islamic, practices, and, to, implement, what, he, saw, as, his, religious, duty, of, commanding, good, and, forbidding, wrong, yahya, michot, says, that, some, of, these, incidences, included, shaving, children, s, heads, leading, an, anti, debauchery, campaign, in, brothels, and, taverns, hitting, an, atheist, before, his, public, execution, destroying, what, was, thought, to, be, a, sacred, rock, in, a, mosque, attacking, astrologers, and, obliging, deviant, sufi, shaykhs, to, make, public, acts, of, contrition, and, adhere, to, the, sunnah, ibn, taymiyya, and, his, disciples, used, to, condemn, wine, sellers, and, they, would, attack, wine, shops, in, damascus, by, breaking, wine, bottles, and, pouring, them, onto, the, floor, a, few, years, later, in, 1296, he, took, over, the, position, of, one, of, his, teachers, zayn, al, din, ibn, al, munadjdjaal, taking, the, post, of, professor, of, hanbali, jurisprudence, at, the, hanbaliyya, madrasa, the, oldest, such, institution, of, this, tradition, in, damascus, this, is, seen, by, some, to, be, the, peak, of, his, scholarly, career, the, year, when, he, began, his, post, at, the, hanbaliyya, madrasa, was, a, time, of, political, turmoil, the, mamluk, sultan, al, adil, kitbugha, was, deposed, by, his, vice, sultan, al, malik, al, mansur, lajin, who, then, ruled, from, 1297, to, 1299, lajin, desired, to, commission, an, expedition, against, the, christians, of, the, armenian, kingdom, of, cilicia, who, formed, an, alliance, with, the, mongol, empire, and, participated, in, the, military, campaign, which, lead, to, the, destruction, of, baghdad, the, capital, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, the, destruction, of, harran, the, birthplace, of, ibn, taymiyya, for, that, purpose, he, urged, ibn, taymiyya, to, call, the, muslims, to, jihad, in, 1298, ibn, taymiyya, wrote, his, explanation, for, the, ayat, al, mutashabihat, the, unclear, verses, of, the, qur, an, titled, al, aqidat, al, hamawiyat, al, kubra, the, creed, of, the, great, people, of, hama, the, book, is, about, divine, attributes, and, it, served, as, an, answer, to, a, question, from, the, city, of, hama, syria, at, that, particular, time, ash, arites, held, prominent, positions, within, the, islamic, scholarly, community, in, both, syria, and, egypt, and, they, held, a, certain, position, on, the, divine, attributes, of, god, ibn, taymiyya, in, his, book, strongly, disagreed, with, their, views, and, this, heavy, opposition, to, the, common, ash, ari, position, caused, considerable, controversy, once, more, ibn, taymiyya, collaborated, with, the, mamluks, in, 1300, when, he, joined, the, punitive, expedition, against, the, alawites, and, shiites, in, the, kasrawan, region, of, the, lebanese, mountains, ibn, taymiyya, believed, that, the, alawites, were, more, heretical, than, jews, and, christians, and, according, to, carole, hillenbrand, the, confrontation, with, the, alawites, occurred, because, they, were, accused, of, collaborating, with, christians, and, mongols, ibn, taymiyya, had, further, active, involvements, in, campaigns, against, the, mongols, and, their, alleged, alawite, allies, in, 1305, ibn, taymiyya, took, part, in, a, second, military, offensive, against, the, alawites, and, the, isma, ilis, in, the, kasrawan, region, of, the, lebanese, mountains, where, they, were, defeated, the, majority, of, the, alawis, and, ismailis, eventually, converted, to, twelver, shiism, and, settled, in, south, lebanon, and, the, bekaa, valley, with, a, few, shia, pockets, that, survived, in, the, lebanese, mountains, the, first, invasion, took, place, between, december, 1299, and, april, 1300, due, to, the, military, campaign, by, the, mamluks, against, the, armenian, kingdom, of, cilicia, who, were, allied, with, the, mongols, due, to, the, mongol, legal, system, that, neglected, sharia, and, implemented, yassa, ibn, taymiyya, had, declared, takfir, upon, the, ilkhanid, regime, and, its, armies, for, ruling, by, man, made, laws, despite, these, laws, being, rarely, enforced, in, muslim, majority, regions, in, an, extensive, manner, openly, rejecting, ghazan, khan, s, claim, to, p, dish, h, al, isl, m, king, of, islam, a, title, which, ghazan, took, to, legitimise, his, military, campaigns, ibn, taymiyya, denounced, him, as, an, infidel, king, and, issued, numerous, fatwas, condemning, the, political, order, of, the, tatars, the, ilkhanate, army, managed, to, defeat, the, mamluk, sultanate, in, the, third, battle, of, homs, and, reach, damascus, by, the, end, of, december, 1299, fearful, of, mongol, atrocities, many, scholars, intellectuals, and, officers, began, to, flee, damascus, in, panic, ibn, taymiyya, was, one, of, those, clerics, who, stood, firm, alongside, the, vulnerable, damascus, citizens, and, called, for, an, uncompromising, and, heroic, resistance, to, the, tatar, invaders, ibn, taymiyya, drew, parallels, of, their, crisis, with, the, riddah, wars, apostate, wars, fought, by, the, first, muslim, caliph, abu, bakr, against, the, renegade, arabian, tribes, that, abandoned, sharia, ibn, taymiyya, severely, rebuked, those, muslims, escaping, in, the, face, of, mongol, onslaught, and, compared, their, state, to, the, withdrawal, of, muslims, in, the, battle, of, uhud, in, a, passionate, letter, to, the, commander, of, the, damascene, citadel, ibn, taymiyya, appealed, until, there, stands, even, a, single, rock, do, everything, in, your, power, to, not, surrender, the, castle, there, is, great, benefit, for, the, people, of, syria, allah, declared, it, a, sanctuary, for, the, people, of, sh, m, where, it, will, remain, a, land, of, faith, and, sunna, until, the, descent, of, the, prophet, jesus, despite, political, pressure, ibn, taymiyya, s, directives, were, heeded, by, the, mamluk, officer, and, mongol, negotiations, to, surrender, the, citadel, stalled, shortly, after, ibn, taymiyya, and, a, number, of, his, acolytes, and, pupils, took, part, in, a, counter, offensive, targeting, various, shia, tribes, allied, to, the, mongols, in, the, peripheral, regions, of, the, city, thereby, repelling, the, mongol, attack, ibn, taymiyya, went, with, a, delegation, of, islamic, scholars, to, talk, to, ghazan, khan, who, was, the, khan, of, the, mongol, ilkhanate, of, iran, to, plead, clemency, by, early, january, 1300, the, mongol, allies, the, armenians, and, georgians, had, caused, widespread, damage, to, damascus, and, they, had, taken, syrian, prisoners, the, mongols, effectively, occupied, damascus, for, the, first, four, months, of, 1303, most, of, the, military, had, fled, the, city, including, most, of, the, civilians, ibn, taymiyya, however, stayed, and, was, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, resistance, inside, damascus, and, he, went, to, speak, directly, to, the, ilkhan, mahmud, ghazan, and, his, vizier, rashid, al, din, tabib, he, sought, the, release, of, muslim, and, dhimmi, prisoners, which, the, mongols, had, taken, in, syria, and, after, negotiation, secured, their, release, the, second, invasion, lasted, between, october, 1300, and, january, 1301, ibn, taymiyya, at, this, time, began, giving, sermons, on, jihad, at, the, umayyad, mosque, as, the, civilians, began, to, flee, in, panic, ibn, taymiyya, pronounced, fatwas, declaring, the, religious, duty, upon, muslims, to, fight, the, mongol, armies, to, death, inflict, a, massive, defeat, and, expel, them, from, syria, in, its, entirety, ibn, taymiyya, also, spoke, to, and, encouraged, the, governor, of, damascus, al, afram, to, achieve, victory, over, the, mongols, he, became, involved, with, al, afram, once, more, when, he, was, sent, to, get, reinforcements, from, cairo, narrating, ibn, taymiyya, s, fierce, stance, on, fighting, the, mongols, ibn, kathir, reports, even, if, you, see, me, on, their, side, with, a, qur, an, on, my, side, kill, them, immediately, the, year, 1303, saw, the, third, mongol, invasion, of, syria, by, ghazan, khan, what, has, been, called, ibn, taymiyya, s, most, famous, fatw, was, his, third, fatwa, issued, against, the, mongols, in, the, mamluk, s, war, ibn, taymiyya, declared, that, jihad, against, the, mongol, attack, on, the, malmuk, sultanate, was, not, only, permissible, but, obligatory, the, reason, being, that, the, mongols, could, not, in, his, opinion, be, true, muslims, despite, the, fact, that, they, had, converted, to, sunni, islam, because, they, ruled, using, what, he, considered, man, made, laws, their, traditional, yassa, code, rather, than, islamic, law, or, sharia, whilst, believing, that, the, yassa, code, was, better, than, the, sharia, law, because, of, this, he, reasoned, they, were, living, in, a, state, of, jahiliyyah, or, pre, islamic, pagan, ignorance, not, only, were, ilkhanate, political, elites, and, its, military, disbelievers, in, the, eyes, of, ibn, taymiyya, but, anybody, who, joined, their, ranks, were, as, guilty, of, riddah, apostasy, as, them, whoever, joins, them, meaning, the, tatars, among, commanders, of, the, military, and, non, commanders, their, ruling, is, the, same, as, theirs, and, they, have, apostatized, from, the, laws, if, the, righteous, forbears, have, called, the, withholders, from, charity, apostates, despite, their, fasting, praying, and, not, fighting, the, muslims, how, about, those, who, became, murderers, of, the, muslims, with, the, enemies, of, allah, and, his, messenger, the, fatwa, broke, new, islamic, legal, ground, because, no, jurist, had, ever, before, issued, a, general, authorization, for, the, use, of, lethal, force, against, muslims, in, battle, and, would, later, influence, modern, day, jihadists, in, their, use, of, violence, against, other, muslims, whom, they, deemed, as, apostates, in, his, legal, verdicts, issued, to, inform, the, populace, ibn, taymiyya, classified, the, tatars, and, their, advocates, into, four, types, ibn, taymiyya, called, on, the, muslims, to, jihad, once, again, and, personally, participated, in, the, battle, of, marj, al, saffar, against, the, ilkhanid, army, leading, his, disciples, in, the, field, with, a, sword, the, battle, began, on, april, 20, of, that, year, on, the, same, day, ibn, taymiyya, declared, a, fatwa, which, exempted, mamluk, soldiers, from, fasting, during, ramadan, so, that, they, could, preserve, their, strength, within, two, days, the, mongols, were, severely, crushed, and, the, battle, was, won, thus, ending, mongol, control, of, syria, these, incidents, greatly, increased, the, scholarly, prestige, and, social, stature, of, ibn, taymiyya, amongst, the, masses, despite, opposition, from, the, establishment, clergy, he, would, soon, be, appointed, as, the, chief, professor, of, the, elite, scholarly, institute, k, miliyya, d, r, al, ha, th, ibn, taymiyya, s, three, unprecedented, fatwas, legal, verdicts, that, excommunicated, the, ilkhanid, authorities, and, their, supporters, as, apostates, over, their, neglect, to, govern, by, sharia, islamic, law, and, preference, of, the, traditional, mongol, imperial, code, of, yassa, would, form, the, theological, basis, of, 20th, century, islamist, and, jihadist, scholars, and, ideologues, reviving, ibn, taymiyya, s, fatwas, during, the, late, 20th, century, jihadist, ideologues, like, sayyid, qutb, abd, al, salam, al, faraj, abdullah, azzam, usama, bin, laden, ayman, al, zawahiri, etc, made, public, takfir, excommunication, of, contemporary, governments, of, the, muslim, world, and, called, for, their, revolutionary, overthrowal, through, armed, jihad, ibn, taymiyya, was, a, fervent, polemicist, who, zealously, launched, theological, refutations, against, various, religious, sects, such, as, the, sufis, jahmites, ash, arites, shias, falsafa, etc, labelling, them, as, heretics, responsible, for, the, crisis, of, mongol, invasions, across, the, islamic, world, he, was, imprisoned, several, times, for, conflicting, with, the, prevailing, opinions, of, the, jurists, and, theologians, of, his, day, a, judge, from, the, city, of, wasit, iraq, requested, that, ibn, taymiyya, write, a, book, on, creed, his, subsequent, creedal, work, al, aqidah, al, waasitiyyah, caused, him, trouble, with, the, authorities, ibn, taymiyya, adopted, the, view, that, god, should, be, described, as, he, was, literally, described, in, the, qur, an, and, in, the, hadith, and, that, all, muslims, were, required, to, believe, this, because, according, to, him, it, was, the, view, held, by, the, early, muslim, community, salaf, within, the, space, of, two, years, 1305, 1306, four, separate, religious, council, hearings, were, held, to, assess, the, correctness, of, his, creed, the, first, hearing, was, held, with, ash, ari, scholars, who, accused, ibn, taymiyya, of, anthropomorphism, at, the, time, ibn, taymiyya, was, 42, years, old, he, was, protected, by, the, then, governor, of, damascus, aqqush, al, afram, during, the, proceedings, the, scholars, suggested, that, he, accept, that, his, creed, was, simply, that, of, the, hanbalites, and, offered, this, as, a, way, out, of, the, charge, however, if, ibn, taymiyya, ascribed, his, creed, to, the, hanbali, school, of, law, then, it, would, be, just, one, view, out, of, the, four, schools, which, one, could, follow, rather, than, a, creed, everybody, must, adhere, to, uncompromising, ibn, taymiyya, maintained, that, it, was, obligatory, for, all, scholars, to, adhere, to, his, creed, two, separate, councils, were, held, a, year, later, on, january, 22, and, 28, 1306, the, first, council, was, in, the, house, of, the, governor, of, damascus, aqqush, al, afram, who, had, protected, him, the, year, before, when, facing, the, shafii, scholars, a, second, hearing, was, held, six, days, later, where, the, indian, scholar, safi, al, din, al, hindi, found, him, innocent, of, all, charges, and, accepted, that, his, creed, was, in, line, with, the, qur, an, and, the, sunnah, regardless, in, april, 1306, the, chief, islamic, judges, of, the, mamluk, state, declared, ibn, taymiyya, guilty, and, he, was, incarcerated, he, was, released, four, months, later, in, september, after, his, release, in, damascus, the, doubts, regarding, his, creed, seemed, to, have, resolved, but, this, was, not, the, case, a, shafii, scholar, ibn, al, sarsari, was, insistent, on, starting, another, hearing, against, ibn, taymiyya, which, was, held, once, again, at, the, house, of, the, governor, of, damascus, al, afram, his, book, al, aqidah, al, waasitiyyah, was, still, not, found, at, fault, at, the, conclusion, of, this, hearing, ibn, taymiyya, and, ibn, al, sarsari, were, sent, to, cairo, to, settle, the, problem, on, the, arrival, of, ibn, taymiyya, and, the, shafi, ite, scholar, in, cairo, in, 1306, an, open, meeting, was, held, the, mamluk, sultan, at, the, time, was, al, nasir, muhammad, and, his, deputy, attended, the, open, meeting, ibn, taymiyya, was, found, innocent, despite, the, open, meeting, objections, regarding, his, creed, continued, and, he, was, summoned, to, the, citadel, in, cairo, for, a, munazara, legal, debate, which, took, place, on, april, 8, 1306, during, the, munazara, his, views, on, divine, attributes, specifically, whether, a, direction, could, be, attributed, to, god, were, debated, by, the, indian, scholar, safi, al, din, al, hindi, in, the, presence, of, islamic, judges, ibn, taymiyya, failed, to, convince, the, judges, of, his, position, and, so, was, incarcerated, for, the, charge, of, anthropomorphism, on, the, recommendation, of, al, hindi, thereafter, he, together, with, his, two, brothers, were, imprisoned, in, the, citadel, of, the, mountain, qal, at, al, jabal, in, cairo, until, september, 25, 1307, he, was, freed, due, to, the, help, he, received, from, two, amirs, salar, and, muhanna, ibn, isa, but, he, was, not, allowed, to, go, back, to, syria, he, was, then, again, summoned, for, a, legal, debate, but, this, time, he, convinced, the, judges, that, his, views, were, correct, and, he, was, allowed, to, go, free, ibn, taymiyya, continued, to, face, troubles, for, his, views, which, were, found, to, be, at, odds, with, those, of, his, contemporaries, his, strong, opposition, to, what, he, believed, to, be, religious, innovations, caused, upset, among, the, prominent, sufis, of, egypt, including, ibn, ata, allah, and, karim, al, din, al, amuli, and, the, locals, who, started, to, protest, against, him, their, main, contention, was, ibn, taymiyya, s, stance, on, tawassul, intercession, in, his, view, a, person, could, not, ask, anyone, other, than, god, for, help, except, on, the, day, of, judgement, when, intercession, in, his, view, would, be, possible, at, the, time, the, people, did, not, restrict, intercession, to, just, the, day, of, judgement, but, rather, they, said, it, was, allowed, in, other, cases, due, to, this, ibn, taymiyya, now, aged, 45, was, ordered, to, appear, before, the, shafi, i, judge, badr, al, din, in, march, 1308, and, was, questioned, on, his, stance, regarding, intercession, thereafter, he, was, incarcerated, in, the, prison, of, the, judges, in, cairo, for, some, months, after, his, release, he, was, allowed, to, return, to, syria, should, he, so, wish, ibn, taymiyya, however, stayed, in, egypt, for, a, further, five, years, 1309, the, year, after, his, release, saw, a, new, mamluk, sultan, accede, to, the, throne, baibars, al, jashnakir, his, reign, marked, by, economical, and, political, unrest, only, lasted, a, year, in, august, 1309, ibn, taymiyya, was, taken, into, custody, and, placed, under, house, arrest, for, seven, months, in, the, new, sultan, s, palace, in, alexandria, he, was, freed, when, al, nasir, muhammad, retook, the, position, of, sultan, on, march, 4, 1310, having, returned, to, cairo, a, week, later, he, was, received, by, al, nasir, the, sultan, would, sometimes, consult, ibn, taymiyya, on, religious, affairs, and, policies, during, the, rest, of, his, three, year, stay, in, cairo, during, this, time, he, continued, to, teach, and, wrote, his, famous, book, al, kitab, al, siyasa, al, shar, iyya, treatise, on, the, government, of, the, religious, law, a, book, noted, for, its, account, of, the, role, of, religion, in, politics, he, spent, his, last, fifteen, years, in, damascus, aged, 50, ibn, taymiyya, returned, to, damascus, via, jerusalem, on, february, 28, 1313, damascus, was, now, under, the, governorship, of, tankiz, there, ibn, taymiyya, continued, his, teaching, role, as, professor, of, hanbali, fiqh, this, is, when, he, taught, his, most, famous, student, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, who, went, on, to, become, a, noted, scholar, in, islamic, history, ibn, qayyim, was, to, share, in, ibn, taymiyya, s, renewed, persecution, three, years, after, his, arrival, in, the, city, ibn, taymiyya, became, involved, in, efforts, to, deal, with, the, increasing, shia, influence, amongst, sunni, muslims, an, agreement, had, been, made, in, 1316, between, the, amir, of, mecca, and, the, ilkhanid, ruler, ljait, brother, of, ghazan, khan, to, allow, a, favourable, policy, towards, shi, ism, in, the, city, around, the, same, time, the, shia, theologian, al, hilli, who, had, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, mongol, ruler, s, decision, to, make, shi, ism, the, state, religion, of, persia, wrote, the, book, minhaj, al, karamah, the, way, of, charisma, which, dealt, with, the, shia, doctrine, of, the, imamate, and, also, served, as, a, refutation, of, the, sunni, doctrine, of, the, caliphate, in, response, ibn, taymiyya, wrote, his, famous, book, minhaj, as, sunnah, an, nabawiyyah, as, a, refutation, of, al, hilli, s, work, in, 1318, ibn, taymiyya, wrote, a, treatise, that, would, curtail, the, ease, with, which, a, muslim, man, could, divorce, his, wife, ibn, taymiyya, s, fatwa, on, divorce, was, not, accepted, by, the, majority, of, scholars, of, the, time, and, this, continued, into, the, ottoman, era, however, almost, every, modern, muslim, nation, state, has, come, to, adopt, ibn, taymiyya, s, position, on, this, issue, of, divorce, at, the, time, he, issued, the, fatwa, ibn, taymiyya, revived, an, edict, by, the, sultan, not, to, issue, fatwas, on, this, issue, but, he, continued, to, do, so, saying, i, cannot, conceal, my, knowledge, as, in, previous, instances, he, stated, that, his, fatwa, was, based, on, the, qur, an, and, hadith, his, view, on, the, issue, was, at, odds, with, the, hanbali, position, this, proved, controversial, among, the, people, in, damascus, as, well, as, the, islamic, scholars, who, opposed, him, on, the, issue, according, to, the, scholars, of, the, time, an, oath, of, divorce, counted, as, a, full, divorce, and, they, were, also, of, the, view, that, three, oaths, of, divorce, taken, under, one, occasion, counted, as, three, separate, divorces, the, significance, of, this, was, that, a, man, who, divorces, the, same, partner, three, times, is, no, longer, allowed, to, remarry, that, person, until, and, if, that, person, marries, and, divorces, another, person, only, then, could, the, man, who, took, the, oath, remarry, his, previous, wife, ibn, taymiyya, accepted, this, but, rejected, the, validity, of, three, oaths, taken, under, one, sitting, to, count, as, three, separate, divorces, as, long, as, the, intention, was, not, to, divorce, moreover, ibn, taymiyya, was, of, the, view, that, a, single, oath, of, divorce, uttered, but, not, intended, also, does, not, count, as, an, actual, divorce, he, stated, that, since, this, is, an, oath, much, like, an, oath, taken, in, the, name, of, god, a, person, must, expiate, for, an, unintentional, oath, in, a, similar, manner, due, to, his, views, and, also, by, not, abiding, to, the, sultan, s, letter, two, years, before, forbidding, him, from, issuing, a, fatwa, on, the, issue, three, council, hearings, were, held, in, as, many, years, 1318, 1319, and, 1320, to, deal, with, this, matter, the, hearing, were, overseen, by, the, viceroy, of, syria, tankiz, this, resulted, in, ibn, taymiyya, being, imprisoned, on, august, 26, 1320, in, the, citadel, of, damascus, he, was, released, about, five, months, and, 18, days, later, on, february, 9, 1321, by, order, of, the, sultan, al, nasir, ibn, taymiyya, was, reinstated, as, teacher, of, hanbali, law, and, he, resumed, teaching, in, 1310, ibn, taymiyya, had, written, a, ris, la, treatise, called, ziy, rat, al, qub, r, or, according, to, another, source, shadd, al, rihal, it, dealt, with, the, validity, and, permissibility, of, making, a, journey, to, visit, the, tombs, of, prophets, and, saints, it, is, reported, that, in, the, book, he, condemned, the, cult, of, saints, and, declared, that, traveling, with, the, sole, purpose, of, visiting, muhammad, s, grave, was, a, blameworthy, religious, innovation, for, this, ibn, taymiyya, was, imprisoned, in, the, citadel, of, damascus, sixteen, years, later, on, july, 18, 1326, aged, 63, along, with, his, student, ibn, qayyim, the, sultan, also, prohibited, him, from, issuing, any, further, fatwas, hanbali, scholar, ahmad, ibn, umar, al, maqdisi, accused, ibn, taymiyya, of, apostasy, over, the, treatise, ibn, taymiyya, referred, to, his, imprisonment, as, a, divine, blessing, during, his, incarceration, he, wrote, that, when, a, scholar, forsakes, what, he, knows, of, the, book, of, god, and, of, the, sunnah, of, his, messenger, and, follows, the, ruling, of, a, ruler, which, contravenes, a, ruling, of, god, and, his, messenger, he, is, a, renegade, an, unbeliever, who, deserves, to, be, punished, in, this, world, and, in, the, hereafter, during, his, imprisonment, he, encountered, opposition, from, the, maliki, and, shafi, i, chief, justices, of, damascus, ta, al, d, n, al, ikhn, he, remained, in, prison, for, over, two, years, and, ignored, the,

b, al, radd, ala, l, ikhn, the, response, to, al, ikhn, the, last, book, was, an, attack, on, ta, al, d, n, al, ikhn, and, explained, his, views, on, saints, wali, when, the, mongols, invaded, syria, in, 1300, he, was, among, those, who, called, for, a, jihad, against, them, and, he, ruled, that, even, though, they, had, recently, converted, to, islam, they, should, be, considered, unbelievers, he, went, to, egypt, in, order, to, acquire, support, for, his, cause, and, while, he, was, there, he, got, embroiled, in, religious, political, disputes, ibn, taymiyya, s, enemies, accused, him, of, advocating, anthropomorphism, a, view, that, was, objectionable, to, the, teachings, of, the, ash, ari, school, of, islamic, theology, and, in, 1306, he, was, imprisoned, for, more, than, a, year, upon, his, release, he, condemned, popular, sufi, practices, and, he, also, condemned, the, influence, of, ibn, arabi, d, 1240, causing, him, to, earn, the, enmity, of, leading, sufi, shaykhs, in, egypt, and, causing, him, to, serve, another, prison, sentence, in, 1310, he, was, released, by, the, egyptian, sultan, in, 1313, the, sultan, allowed, ibn, taymiyya, to, return, to, damascus, where, he, worked, as, a, teacher, and, a, jurist, he, had, supporters, among, the, powerful, but, his, outspokenness, and, his, nonconformity, to, traditional, sunni, doctrines, and, his, denunciation, of, sufi, ideals, and, practices, continued, to, draw, the, wrath, of, the, religious, and, political, authorities, in, syria, and, egypt, he, was, arrested, and, released, several, more, times, but, while, he, was, in, prison, he, was, allowed, to, write, fatwas, advisory, opinions, on, matters, of, law, in, defense, of, his, beliefs, despite, the, controversy, that, surrounded, him, ibn, taymiyya, s, influence, grew, and, it, spread, from, hanbali, circles, to, members, of, other, sunni, legal, schools, and, sufi, groups, among, his, foremost, students, were, ibn, kathir, d, 1373, a, leading, medieval, historian, and, a, quran, commentator, and, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziya, d, 1350, a, prominent, hanbali, jurist, and, a, theologian, who, helped, spread, his, teacher, s, influence, after, his, teacher, s, death, in, 1328, ibn, taymiyya, died, while, he, was, a, prisoner, in, the, citadel, of, damascus, and, he, was, buried, in, the, city, s, sufi, cemetery, he, fell, ill, in, early, september, 1328, and, died, at, the, age, of, 65, on, september, 26, of, that, year, whilst, in, prison, at, the, citadel, of, damascus, once, this, news, reached, the, public, there, was, a,

hanbal, received, a, larger, attendance, this, is, also, mentioned, by, ibn, abd, al, hadi, caterina, bori, says, that, in, the, islamic, tradition, wider, popular, attendance, at, funerals, was, a, mark, of, public, reverence, a, demonstration, of, the, deceased, s, rectitude, and, a, sign, of, divine, approbation, ibn, taymiyya, is, said, to, have, spent, a, lifetime, objecting, to, tomb, veneration, only, to, cast, a, more, powerful, posthumous, spell, than, any, of, his, sufi, contemporaries, on, his, death, his, personal, effects, were, in, such, demand, that, bidders, for, his, lice, killing, camphor, necklace, pushed, its, price, up, to, 150, dirhams, and, his, skullcap, fetched, a, full, 500, a, few, mourners, sought, and, succeeded, in, drinking, the, water, used, for,

headstone, was, broken, according, to, author, sadakat, kadri, several, of, ibn, taymiyya, s, students, became, notable, scholars, in, their, own, right, his, students, came, from, different, backgrounds, and, belonged, to, various, different, schools, of, thought, the, most, well, known, of, them, are, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, and, ibn, kathir, while, his, other, students, include, in, the, 21st, century, ibn, taymiyya, is, one, of, the, most, cited, medieval, authors, and, his, treatises, are, regarded, to, be, of, central, intellectual, importance, by, several, islamic, revivalist, movements, ibn, taymiyya, s, disciples, consisting, of, both, hanbalis, and, non, hanbalis, were, attracted, to, his, advocacy, of, ijtihad, outside, the, established, boundaries, of, the, madhabs, and, shared, his, taste, for, activism, and, religious, reform, some, of, his, unorthodox, legal, views, in, the, field, of, fiqh, were, also, regarded, as, a, challenge, by, mainstream, fuqaha, many, scholars, have, argued, that, ibn, taymiyya, did, not, enjoy, popularity, among, the, intelligentsia, of, his, day, yossef, rapoport, and, shahab, ahmed, assert, that, he, was, a, minority, figure, in, his, own, times, and, the, centuries, that, followed, caterina, bori, goes, further, arguing, that, despite, popularity, ibn, taymiyya, may, have, enjoyed, among, the, masses, he, appears, to, have, been, not, merely, unpopular, among, the, scholars, of, his, day, but, somewhat, of, an, embarrassment, khalid, el, rouayheb, notes, similarly, that, ibn, taymiyya, had, very, little, influence, on, mainstream, sunni, islam, until, the, nineteenth, century, and, that, he, was, a, little, read, scholar, with, problematic, and, controversial, views, he, also, comments, the, idea, that, ibn, taymiyya, had, an, immediate, and, significant, impact, on, the, course, of, sunni, islamic, religious, history, simply, does, not, cohere, with, the, evidence, that, we, have, from, the, five, centuries, that, elapsed, between, his, death, and, the, rise, of, sunni, revivalism, in, the, modern, period, it, was, only, since, the, late, nineteenth, and, the, early, twentieth, centuries, that, the, scholarly, influence, of, ibn, taymiyya, has, come, to, acquire, an, unprecedented, prominence, in, muslim, societies, due, to, the, efforts, of, islamic, revivalists, like, rashid, rida, on, the, other, hand, prof, al, matroudi, of, soas, university, says, that, ibn, taymiyya, was, perhaps, the, most, eminent, and, influential, hanbali, jurist, of, the, middle, ages, and, one, of, the, most, prolific, among, them, he, was, also, a, renowned, scholar, of, islam, whose, influence, was, felt, not, only, during, his, lifetime, but, extended, through, the, centuries, until, the, present, day, ibn, taymiyya, s, followers, often, deemed, him, as, sheikh, ul, islam, an, honorific, title, with, which, he, is, sometimes, still, termed, today, in, the, pre, modern, era, ibn, taymiyya, was, considered, a, controversial, figure, within, sunni, islam, and, had, a, number, of, critics, during, his, life, and, in, the, centuries, thereafter, the, shafi, i, scholar, ibn, hajar, al, haytami, stated, that, make, sure, you, do, not, listen, to, what, is, in, the, books, of, ibn, taymiyya, and, his, student, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, and, other, such, people, who, have, taken, their, own, whim, as, their, god, and, who, have, been, led, astray, by, god, and, whose, hearts, and, ears, have, been, sealed, and, whose, eyes, have, been, covered, by, him, may, god, forsake, the, one, who, follows, them, and, purify, the, earth, of, their, likes, he, also, stated, that, ibn, taymiyya, is, a, servant, whom, god, has, forsaken, led, astray, made, blind, and, deaf, and, degraded, such, is, the, explicit, verdict, of, the, leading, scholars, who, have, exposed, the, rottenness, of, his, ways, and, the, errors, of, his, statements, taqi, al, din, al, hisni, condemned, ibn, taymiyya, in, even, stronger, terms, by, referring, to, him, as, the, heretic, from, harran, and, similarly, munawi, considered, ibn, taymiyya, to, be, an, innovator, though, not, an, unbeliever, taqi, al, din, al, subki, criticised, ibn, taymiyya, for, contradicting, the, consensus, of, the, muslims, by, his, anthropomorphism, by, his, claims, that, accidents, exist, in, god, by, suggesting, that, god, was, speaking, in, time, and, by, his, belief, in, the, eternity, of, the, world, ibn, batt, ta, d, 770, 1369, famously, wrote, a, work, questioning, ibn, taymiyya, s, mental, state, the, possibility, of, psychological, abnormalities, not, with, standing, ibn, taymiyya, s, personality, by, multiple, accounts, was, fiery, and, oftentimes, unpredictable, the, historian, al, maqrizi, said, regarding, the, rift, between, the, sunni, ash, ari, s, and, ibn, taymiyya, people, are, divided, into, two, factions, over, the, question, of, ibn, taymiyya, for, until, the, present, the, latter, has, retained, admirers, and, disciples, in, syria, and, egypt, both, his, supporters, and, rivals, grew, to, respect, ibn, taymiyya, because, he, was, uncompromising, in, his, views, dhahabi, s, views, towards, ibn, taymiyya, were, ambivalent, his, praise, of, ibn, taymiyya, is, invariably, qualified, with, criticism, and, misgivings, and, he, considered, him, to, be, both, a, brilliant, shaykh, and, also, cocky, and, impetuous, the, hanafi, maturidi, scholar, ala, al, din, al, bukhari, said, that, anyone, that, gives, ibn, taymiyya, the, title, shaykh, al, isl, m, is, a, disbeliever, despite, the, prevalent, condemnations, of, ibn, taymiyya, outside, hanbali, school, during, the, pre, modern, period, many, prominent, non, hanbali, scholars, such, as, ibrahim, al, kurrani, d, 1690, sh, h, wal, all, h, al, dihlawi, d, 1762, mehmet, birgiwi, d, 1573, ibn, al, am, r, al, san, ani, d, 1768, mu, ammad, al, shawk, n, d, 1834, etc, would, come, to, the, defense, of, ibn, taymiyya, and, advocate, his, ideas, during, this, era, in, the, 18th, century, influential, south, asian, islamic, scholar, and, revivalist, shah, waliullah, dehlawi, would, become, the, most, prominent, advocate, of, the, doctrines, of, ibn, taymiyya, and, profoundly, transformed, the, religious, thought, in, south, asia, his, seminary, madrasah, i, rahimya, became, a, hub, of, intellectual, life, in, the, country, and, the, ideas, developed, there, quickly, spread, to, wider, academic, circles, making, a, powerful, defense, of, ibn, taymiyya, and, his, doctrines, shah, waliullah, wrote, our, assessment, of, ibn, taimiyya, after, full, investigation, is, that, he, was, a, scholar, of, the, book, of, god, and, had, full, command, over, its, etymological, and, juristic, implications, he, remembered, by, heart, the, traditions, of, the, prophet, and, accounts, of, elders, salaf, he, excelled, in, intelligence, and, brilliance, he, argued, in, defence, of, ahl, al, sunnah, with, great, eloquence, and, force, no, innovation, or, irreligious, act, is, reported, about, him, there, is, not, a, single, matter, on, which, he, is, without, his, defence, based, on, the, qur, an, and, the, sunnah, so, it, is, difficult, to, find, a, man, in, the, whole, world, who, possesses, the, qualities, of, ibn, taimiyya, no, one, can, come, anywhere, near, him, in, the, force, of, his, speech, and, writing, people, who, harassed, him, did, not, possess, even, one, tenth, of, his, scholarly, excellence, the, reputation, and, stature, of, ibn, taymiyya, amongst, non, anbal, sunni, scholars, would, significantly, improve, between, the, eighteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, from, a, little, read, scholar, considered, controversial, by, many, he, would, become, one, of, the, most, popular, scholarly, figures, in, the, sunni, religious, tradition, the, nineteenth, century, iraqi, scholar, khayr, al, d, n, al, l, s, d, 1899, wrote, an, influential, treatise, titled, jal, al, aynayn, fi, mu, kamat, al, a, madayn, in, defense, of, ibn, taymiyya, the, treatise, would, make, great, impact, on, major, scholars, of, the, salafiyya, movement, in, syria, and, egypt, such, as, jam, l, al, d, n, al, q, sim, d, 1914, and, mu, ammad, rash, d, ri, d, 1935, praising, ibn, taymiyya, as, a, central, and, heroic, islamic, figure, of, the, classical, era, rashid, rida, wrote, after, the, power, of, the, ash, aris, reigned, supreme, in, the, middle, ages, al, qur, n, al, wus, and, the, ahl, al, ad, th, and, the, followers, of, the, salaf, were, weakened, there, appeared, in, the, eighth, century, the, great, mujaddid, shaykh, al, islam, a, mad, taq, al, d, n, ibn, taymiyya, whose, like, has, not, been, seen, in, mastery, of, both, the, traditional, and, rational, sciences, and, in, the, power, of, argument, egypt, and, india, have, revived, his, books, and, the, books, of, his, student, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, after, a, time, when, they, were, only, available, in, najd, now, they, have, spread, to, both, east, and, west, and, will, become, the, main, support, of, the, muslims, of, the, earth, ibn, taymiyya, s, works, served, as, an, inspiration, for, later, muslim, scholars, and, historical, figures, who, have, been, regarded, as, his, admirers, or, disciples, in, the, contemporary, world, he, may, be, considered, at, the, root, of, wahhabism, the, senussi, order, and, other, later, reformist, movements, ibn, taymiyya, has, been, noted, to, have, influenced, rashid, rida, abul, a, la, maududi, sayyid, qutb, hassan, al, banna, abdullah, azzam, and, osama, bin, laden, the, terrorist, organization, islamic, state, in, iraq, and, the, levant, used, a, fatwa, of, ibn, taymiyya, to, justify, the, burning, alive, of, jordanian, pilot, muath, al, kasasbeh, after, the, iranian, revolution, conservative, sunni, ulema, robustly, championed, ibn, taymiyya, s, anti, shia, polemics, across, the, islamic, world, since, the, 1980s, and, vast, majority, of, sunni, intellectual, circles, adopted, ibn, taymiyya, s, rhetoric, against, shi, ism, ibn, taymiyya, s, appeals, to, the, precedence, of, the, qur, an, and, the, sunna, over, the, authority, of, the, madh, hab, system, has, inspired, a, wide, range, of, islamic, reform, movements, over, the, last, few, centuries, and, especially, the, salafiyya, reform, movement, that, differ, from, other, sunnis, who, adhere, to, the, four, legal, schools, of, fiqh, jurisprudence, these, include, the, 17th, century, kadizadeli, movement, 18th, century, wahhabi, movement, as, well, as, the, islamic, reformist, movement, of, ibn, al, am, r, al, san, ani, d, 1768, and, mu, ammad, al, shawk, n, d, 1834, in, yemen, in, the, nineteenth, century, taymiyyan, tradition, would, expand, across, the, islamic, world, influencing, the, ahl, i, hadith, movement, in, south, asia, and, the, salafiyya, movement, in, iraq, syria, and, egypt, ibn, taymiyya, adamantly, insisted, that, his, theological, doctrines, constituted, the, original, creed, of, the, salaf, as, well, as, that, of, abul, hasan, al, ash, ari, the, eponym, of, the, ash, arite, school, he, also, believed, that, sharia, islamic, law, was, best, preserved, through, the, teachings, and, practices, of, the, salaf, the, earliest, three, generations, of, muslims, modern, islamic, revivalist, movements, salute, ibn, taymiyya, as, the, architect, of, salafism, which, symbolises, the, concept, of, reviving, the, traditions, and, values, of, the, golden, age, of, the, prophet, for, salafiyya, movements, across, the, islamic, world, ibn, taymiyya, is, their, exemplar, scholar, who, revived, the, methodology, of, the, salaf, and, also, a, social, reformer, who, defiantly, stood, against, foreign, occupation, today, salafi, muslims, constitute, the, most, avid, readers, and, promoters, of, the, works, of, ibn, taymiyya, various, concepts, within, modern, islamist, movements, can, be, attributed, to, ibn, taymiyya, ibn, taymiyya, is, highly, revered, in, contemporary, militant, islamist, and, jihadist, circles, for, his, 1303, fatwa, of, takfir, excommunication, against, mongol, ilkhanate, rulers, who, were, recent, converts, to, islam, and, his, assertion, that, it, became, obligatory, for, true, muslims, to, wage, jihad, against, the, apostate, mongol, leaders, and, muslim, citizens, who, accepted, the, yassa, code, influenced, by, ibn, taymiyya, sayyid, qutb, would, take, up, ibn, taymiyya, s, anti, mongol, fatwa, and, apply, it, on, contemporary, regimes, across, the, islamic, world, ibn, taymiyya, s, other, major, theological, mission, was, to, re, assert, the, primacy, of, armed, jihad, in, islamic, faith, which, played, a, major, role, in, shaping, future, militant, interpretations, of, islam, along, with, total, literal, adherence, to, sharia, he, held, that, waging, martial, jihad, was, an, islamic, religious, obligation, for, all, muslims, when, under, foreign, invasion, these, ideas, would, be, readily, embraced, in, the, 20th, century, by, various, militant, islamist, movements, and, underpinned, the, theological, justification, for, militancy, of, groups, like, al, qaeda, isis, etc, scholars, like, yahya, michot, have, noted, that, ibn, taymiyya, has, thus, become, a, sort, of, forefather, of, al, qaeda, one, of, main, arguments, put, forth, by, ibn, taymiyya, was, his, categorising, the, world, into, distinct, territories, the, domain, of, islam, dar, al, islam, where, the, rule, is, of, islam, and, sharia, law, is, enforced, the, domain, of, unbelief, dar, al, kufr, ruled, by, unbelievers, and, the, domain, of, war, dar, al, harb, which, is, territory, under, the, rule, of, unbelievers, who, are, involved, in, an, active, or, potential, conflict, with, the, domain, of, islam, ibn, taymiyya, included, a, fourth, when, the, mongols, whom, he, considered, unbelievers, took, control, of, the, city, of, mardin, the, population, included, many, muslims, believing, mardin, was, neither, the, domain, of, islam, as, islam, was, not, legally, applied, with, an, armed, forces, consisting, of, muslims, nor, the, domain, of, war, because, the, inhabitants, were, muslim, ibn, taymiyya, created, a, new, composite, category, known, as, dar, al, ahd, a, second, concept, is, making, a, declaration, of, apostasy, takfir, against, a, muslim, who, does, not, obey, islam, but, at, the, same, time, ibn, taymiyya, maintained, that, no, one, can, question, anothers, faith, and, curse, them, as, based, on, one, s, own, desire, because, faith, is, defined, by, god, and, the, prophet, he, said, rather, than, cursing, or, condemning, them, an, approach, should, be, taken, where, they, are, educated, about, the, religion, another, concept, attributed, to, ibn, taymiyya, is, the, duty, to, oppose, and, kill, muslim, rulers, who, do, not, implement, the, revealed, law, shari, a, based, on, this, doctrine, ibn, taymiyya, excommunicated, the, ilkhanid, state, for, not, ruling, by, sharia, islamic, law, despite, officially, professing, islam, ibn, taymiyya, issued, various, fatwas, obliging, all, muslims, to, fight, the, mongols, declaring, them, as, mushrikun, polytheists, similar, to, the, people, from, the, age, of, jahiliyya, pre, islamic, ignorance, thus, he, is, widely, regarded, as, the, spiritual, forefather, of, the, salafi, jihadist, thought, 20th, century, islamist, ideologues, like, muhammad, rashid, rida, sayyid, qutb, abd, al, salam, faraj, usama, bin, laden, etc, drew, upon, these, revolutionary, ideas, to, justify, armed, jihad, against, the, contemporary, nation, states, ibn, taymiyya, s, fatwa, on, alawites, as, more, infidel, than, christians, and, jews, has, been, recited, by, muslim, brotherhood, affiliated, scholar, yusuf, al, qaradawi, ibn, taymiyya, s, role, in, the, islamist, movements, of, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, century, have, also, been, noted, by, the, previous, coordinator, for, counterterrorism, at, the, united, states, department, of, state, daniel, benjamin, who, labels, the, chapter, on, the, history, of, modern, islamic, movements, in, his, book, the, age, of, sacred, terror, as, ibn, taymiyya, and, his, children, yossef, rapoport, a, reader, in, islamic, history, at, queen, mary, however, says, this, is, not, a, probable, narrative, ibn, taymiyya, s, intellectual, tradition, and, ideas, such, as, his, emphasis, on, the, revival, of, pristine, ideals, and, practices, of, early, generations, also, made, an, intense, impact, on, the, leading, ideologue, of, revolutionary, islamism, in, south, asia, sayyid, abul, a, la, maududi, 1903, 1979, c, e, 1321, 1399, a, h, one, of, ibn, taymiyya, s, most, famous, fatwas, are, regarding, the, mongols, who, had, conquered, and, destroyed, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, 1258, and, had, then, converted, to, islam, once, they, were, in, control, the, town, of, mardin, they, behaved, unjustly, with, their, subjects, so, the, people, of, mardin, asked, ibn, taymiyya, for, a, legal, verdict, regarding, the, classification, of, the, territory, under, which, they, live, he, categorized, the, territory, as, dar, al, ahd, which, in, some, ways, is, similar, to, dar, al, kufr, domain, of, unbelievers, included, in, his, verdict, was, declaring, the, mongol, ruler, ghazan, and, other, mongols, who, did, not, accept, shari, a, in, full, as, unbelievers, he, was, also, asked, whether, muslims, living, in, mardin, had, to, emigrate, hijrah, to, islamic, territories, on, account, of, implementation, of, man, made, laws, ibn, taymiyya, responded, in, a, detailed, fatwa, if, he, who, resides, in, m, rd, n, is, unable, to, practice, his, religion, then, he, must, emigrate, if, this, is, not, the, case, then, it, remains, preferable, but, not, mandatory, the, helping, of, the, enemies, of, the, muslims, with, their, lives, and, wealth, is, prohibited, upon, them, and, it, is, required, to, abstain, from, that, from, whatever, route, possible, if, that, is, not, possible, except, by, undertaking, migration, then, it, is, obligatory, it, is, not, of, the, category, of, the, dar, al, islam, nor, of, the, category, of, dar, al, harb, it, is, a, third, division, by, which, the, muslim, is, treated, according, to, what, he, deserves, and, outsiders, are, dealt, with, as, they, deserve, according, to, nettler, and, k, chichian, ibn, taymiyya, affirmed, that, jihad, against, the, mongols, was, not, only, permissible, but, obligatory, because, the, latter, ruled, not, according, to, shar, ah, but, through, their, traditional, and, therefore, manmade, yassa, code, this, essentially, meant, that, mongols, were, living, in, a, state, of, j, hil, yah, ignorance, the, authors, further, state, that, his, two, famous, students, ibn, qayyim, and, ibn, kathir, agreed, with, this, ruling, he, called, for, a, defensive, jihad, to, mobilize, the, people, to, kill, the, mongol, rulers, and, any, one, who, supported, them, muslim, or, non, muslim, ibn, taymiyya, when, talking, about, those, who, support, the, mongols, said, everyone, who, is, with, them, mongols, in, the, state, over, which, they, rule, has, to, be, regarded, as, belonging, to, the, most, evil, class, of, men, he, is, either, an, atheist, zind, q, or, a, hypocrite, who, does, not, believe, in, the, essence, of, the, religion, of, islam, this, means, that, he, only, outwardly, pretends, to, be, muslim, or, he, belongs, to, the, worst, class, of, all, people, who, are, the, people, of, the, bida, heretical, innovations, yahya, mochet, says, that, ibn, taymiyya, s, call, to, war, was, not, simply, to, cause, a, rebellion, against, the, political, power, in, place, but, to, repel, an, external, enemy, in, another, series, of, fatwas, ibn, taymiyya, reiterated, the, religious, obligation, of, muslims, to, fight, the, ilkhanids, on, account, of, their, negligence, of, islamic, laws, he, also, took, issue, with, their, non, religious, approach, to, dealing, with, various, communities, such, as, christians, jews, buddhists, etc, and, employing, a, large, chunk, of, their, armies, with, non, muslims, citing, these, and, various, other, reasons, ibn, taymiyya, pronounced, fighting, them, is, obligatory, by, consensus, of, the, muslims, if, fighting, against, the, kurds, and, the, arabs, and, others, from, the, bedouins, who, do, not, adhere, to, the, law, of, islam, is, obligated, even, if, they, are, not, of, harm, to, the, people, living, in, the, cities, then, how, about, these, people, yes, it, is, required, to, exhibit, the, laws, in, fighting, them, they, call, to, the, religion, of, islam, and, praise, the, religion, of, these, disbelievers, over, the, religion, of, the, muslims, and, they, legislate, in, what, they, dispute, between, themselves, with, the, legislation, of, the, time, of, ignorance, not, with, the, legislation, of, allah, and, his, messenger, such, is, the, case, of, the, elders, among, their, viziers, and, others, who, put, the, religion, of, islam, similar, to, the, religion, of, the, jews, and, christians, and, claiming, that, these, are, all, ways, to, allah, then, among, them, are, those, who, choose, the, religion, of, the, jews, or, christians, and, those, who, choose, the, religion, of, the, muslims, this, phenomenon, is, increasing, in, great, number, among, them, even, in, their, jurists, and, worshippers, especially, the, jahmites, from, the, pharaonic, atheists, and, the, like, as, philosophy, has, overtaken, their, thought, the, viziers, who, spread, the, views, of, their, leader, ultimately, lead, them, into, the, aforementioned, class, they, become, these, philosopher, jews, ascribing, to, islam, what, they, have, of, their, judaism, and, philosophy, in, 2010, a, group, of, islamic, scholars, at, the, mardin, conference, argued, that, ibn, taymiyya, s, famous, fatwa, about, the, residents, of, mardin, when, it, was, under, the, control, of, the, mongols, was, misprinted, into, an, order, to, fight, the, people, living, under, their, territory, whereas, the, actual, statement, is, the, muslims, living, therein, should, be, treated, according, to, their, rights, as, muslims, while, the, non, muslims, living, there, outside, of, the, authority, of, islamic, law, should, be, treated, according, to, their, rights, they, have, based, their, understanding, on, the, original, manuscript, in, the, al, zahiriyah, library, and, the, transmission, by, ibn, taymiyya, s, student, ibn, muflih, the, participants, of, the, mardin, conference, also, rejected, the, categorization, of, the, world, into, different, domains, of, war, and, peace, stating, that, the, division, was, a, result, of, the, circumstances, at, the, time, the, participants, further, stated, that, the, division, has, become, irrelevant, with, the, existence, of, nation, states, ibn, taymiyyah, often, perceived, as, a, critic, of, sufism, had, a, more, nuanced, view, than, is, commonly, understood, while, he, critiqued, certain, practices, he, deemed, innovations, bid, ah, he, was, an, admirer, of, the, spiritual, path, when, it, adhered, to, the, foundational, principles, of, islam, a, notable, example, of, this, is, his, admiration, for, shaykh, abdul, qadir, jilani, a, revered, sufi, saint, ibn, taymiyyah, praised, shaykh, abdul, qadir, jilani, for, his, adherence, to, the, sharia, islamic, law, and, his, deep, spirituality, considering, him, a, model, of, the, correct, practice, of, sufism, ibn, taymiyyah, s, writings, reflect, a, balanced, approach, to, sufism, in, his, majmu, al, fatawa, he, acknowledges, the, importance, of, tasawwuf, when, practiced, in, alignment, with, the, qur, an, and, sunnah, he, wrote, about, the, legitimate, spiritual, practices, that, lead, to, purification, of, the, soul, tazkiyah, and, the, cultivation, of, sincerity, ikhlas, ibn, taymiyyah, distinguished, between, genuine, sufi, practices, and, those, he, considered, deviations, for, instance, he, was, critical, of, certain, ecstatic, utterances, shath, and, practices, he, viewed, as, departures, from, orthodox, islam, but, he, appreciated, the, works, of, early, sufis, like, junayd, al, baghdadi, and, abdul, qadir, jilani, who, maintained, a, firm, grounding, in, sharia, moreover, ibn, taymiyyah, himself, was, buried, in, a, sufi, cemetery, which, signifies, his, recognition, and, respect, within, the, broader, sufi, community, his, respect, for, genuine, sufism, is, evident, in, his, admiration, for, abdul, qadir, jilani, whose, teachings, emphasized, the, importance, of, sharia, compliance, along, with, spiritual, devotion, this, reverence, is, not, merely, theoretical, ibn, taymiyyah, s, students, and, followers, such, as, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, also, echoed, his, views, furthering, the, integration, of, sufi, spirituality, with, orthodox, islamic, practice, thus, ibn, taymiyyah, s, approach, to, sufism, was, one, of, reform, rather, than, outright, rejection, he, supported, sufi, practices, that, stayed, true, to, islamic, principles, and, critiqued, those, that, strayed, this, balanced, perspective, is, crucial, for, understanding, his, relationship, with, tasawwuf, and, dispelling, the, notion, that, he, was, entirely, against, sufism, ibn, taymiyya, is, widely, regarded, as, an, anti, rationalist, hater, of, logic, and, a, strict, literalist, who, was, responsible, for, the, demise, of, rationalist, tendencies, within, the, classical, sunni, tradition, through, his, polemical, treatises, such, as, al, radd, ala, al, mantiqiyy, n, refutation, of, the, rationalists, ibn, taymiyya, zealously, denounced, syllogism, which, provided, the, rational, foundations, for, both, kalam, speculative, theology, and, falsafa, according, to, lebanese, philosopher, majid, fakhry, ibn, taymiyah, protests, against, the, abuses, of, philosophy, and, theology, and, advocates, a, return, to, the, orthodox, ways, of, the, ancients, al, salaf, in, his, religious, zeal, he, is, determined, to, abolish, centuries, of, religious, truth, as, they, had, been, long, before, they, became, troubled, by, theological, and, philosophical, controversies, jamaat, e, islami, leader, abdul, haq, ansari, contends, the, ubiquitous, notion, that, ibn, taymiyya, rejected, sufism, outright, as, erroneous, while, the, popular, image, of, ibn, taymiyya, that, he, sufism, indiscriminately, deadly, against, the, sufis, and, no, place, for, sufism, in, islam, it, is, historically, known, according, to, the, same, scholar, that, ibn, taymiyya, actually, considered, tasawwuf, to, be, a, significant, discipline, of, islam, far, from, saying, has, no, place, in, islam, ibn, taymiyya, was, on, the, whole, sympathetic, towards, what, everyone, at, the, time, considered, an, important, aspect, of, islamic, life, various, scholars, have, also, asserted, that, ibn, taymiyya, had, a, deep, reverence, and, appreciation, for, the, works, of, such, major, sufi, awliyaa, saints, such, as, junayd, sahl, al, tustari, abu, talib, al, makki, bayazid, bastami, etc, and, was, part, of, the, qadiriyya, sufi, order, himself, saudi, scholar, hatem, al, awni, has, criticised, ibn, taymiyya, over, his, sectarian, discourse, against, ash, arite, and, maturidite, schools, as, well, as, his, creedal, beliefs, like, three, fold, classification, of, tawhid, monotheism, scholars, like, ignac, goldziher, described, ibn, taymiyya, as, a, hanbalite, zealot, who, harshly, denounced, various, practices, as, bid, ah, religious, innovations, and, rejected, all, forms, of, philosophical, influences, speculative, theology, sufism, and, pantheistic, doctrines, like, wahdat, al, wujud, others, such, as, the, french, scholar, henri, laoust, 1905, 1983, have, argued, that, such, portrayals, of, ibn, taymiyya, are, flawed, inasmuch, as, they, are, often, borne, of, a, limited, reading, of, the, theologian, s, substantial, corpus, of, works, many, of, which, have, not, yet, been, translated, from, the, original, arabic, according, to, laoust, ibn, taymiyya, wanted, to, reform, the, practice, of, medieval, sufism, as, part, of, his, wider, aim, to, reform, sunni, islam, of, which, sufism, was, a, major, aspect, at, the, time, by, divesting, both, these, traditions, of, what, he, perceived, as, heretical, innovations, within, them, according, to, james, pavlin, professor, of, theology, at, rutgers, university, ibn, taymiyya, remains, one, of, the, most, controversial, islamic, thinkers, today, because, of, his, supposed, influence, on, many, fundamentalist, movements, the, common, understanding, of, his, ideas, have, been, filtered, through, the, bits, and, pieces, of, his, statements, that, have, been, misappropriated, by, alleged, supporters, and, avowed, critics, alike, ibn, taymiyya, left, behind, a, considerable, body, of, work, ranging, from, 350, according, to, his, student, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, to, 500, according, to, his, student, al, dhahabi, oliver, leaman, says, ibn, taymiyya, produced, some, 700, works, in, the, field, of, islamic, sciences, his, scholarly, output, has, been, described, as, immense, with, a, wide, scope, and, its, contents, bear, the, marks, of, brilliant, insights, hastily, jotted, down, in, his, early, life, his, work, was, mostly, based, on, theology, and, the, use, of, reason, in,
