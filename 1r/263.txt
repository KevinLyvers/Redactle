the, spanish, language, and, one, of, the, world, s, pre, eminent, novelists, he, is, best, known, for, his, novel, don, quixote, a, work, considered, as, the, first, modern, novel, the, novel, has, been, labelled, by, many, well, known, authors, as, the, best, book, of, all, time, and, the, best, and, most, central, work, in, world, literature, much, of, his, life, was, spent, in, relative, poverty, and, obscurity, which, led, to, many, of, his, early, works, being, lost, despite, this, his, influence, and, literary, contribution, are, reflected, by, the, fact, that, spanish, is, often, referred, to, as, the, language, of, cervantes, in, 1569, cervantes, was, forced, to, leave, spain, and, move, to, rome, where, he, worked, in, the, household, of, a, cardinal, in, 1570, he, enlisted, in, a, spanish, navy, infantry, regiment, and, was, badly, wounded, at, the, battle, of, lepanto, in, october, 1571, and, lost, the, use, of, his, left, arm, and, hand, he, served, as, a, soldier, until, 1575, when, he, was, captured, by, barbary, pirates, after, five, years, in, captivity, he, was, ransomed, and, returned, to, madrid, his, first, significant, novel, titled, la, galatea, was, published, in, 1585, but, he, continued, to, work, as, a, purchasing, agent, and, later, as, a, government, tax, collector, part, one, of, don, quixote, was, published, in, 1605, and, part, two, in, 1615, other, works, include, the, 12, novelas, ejemplares, exemplary, novels, a, long, poem, the, viaje, del, parnaso, journey, to, parnassus, and, ocho, comedias, y, ocho, entremeses, eight, plays, and, eight, interludes, the, novel, los, trabajos, de, persiles, y, sigismunda, the, travails, of, persiles, and, sigismunda, was, published, posthumously, in, 1616, the, cave, of, medrano, also, known, as, the, casa, de, medrano, in, argamasilla, de, alba, which, has, been, known, since, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, and, according, to, the, tradition, of, argamasilla, de, alba, was, the, prison, of, don, miguel, de, cervantes, and, the, place, where, he, conceived, and, began, to, write, his, famous, work, don, quixote, de, la, mancha, despite, his, subsequent, renown, much, of, cervantes, life, is, uncertain, including, his, name, background, and, what, he, looked, like, although, he, signed, himself, cerbantes, his, printers, used, cervantes, which, became, the, common, form, in, later, life, cervantes, used, saavedra, the, name, of, a, distant, relative, rather, than, the, more, usual, cortinas, after, his, mother, but, historian, luce, l, pez, baralt, claimed, that, it, comes, from, the, word, shaibedraa, that, in, arabic, dialect, means, one, handed, his, nickname, during, his, captivity, another, area, of, dispute, is, his, religious, background, it, has, been, suggested, that, not, only, cervantes, father, but, also, his, mother, may, have, been, new, christians, anthony, cascardi, writes, while, the, family, might, have, had, some, claim, to, nobility, they, often, found, themselves, in, financial, straits, moreover, they, may, have, been, of, converso, origin, that, is, converts, to, catholicism, of, jewish, ancestry, in, the, spain, of, cervantes, days, this, meant, living, under, clouds, of, official, suspicion, and, social, mistrust, with, far, more, limited, opportunities, than, were, enjoyed, by, members, of, the, old, christian, caste, according, to, charles, d, presberg, there, is, no, wide, following, for, the, view, that, cervantes, had, converso, origins, cuban, writer, roberto, echevarr, a, asserts, that, the, claims, of, cervantes, converso, origins, are, based, on, very, flimsy, evidence, namely, cervantes, lack, of, social, and, financial, progression, in, a, time, when, such, rewards, were, denied, to, most, spaniards, regardless, of, social, group, it, is, generally, accepted, miguel, de, cervantes, was, born, around, 29, september, 1547, in, alcal, de, henares, he, was, the, second, son, of, barber, surgeon, rodrigo, de, cervantes, and, his, wife, leonor, de, cortinas, c, 1520, 1593, rodrigo, came, from, c, rdoba, andalusia, where, his, father, juan, de, cervantes, was, an, influential, lawyer, rodrigo, was, frequently, in, debt, or, searching, for, work, and, moved, constantly, leonor, came, from, arganda, del, rey, and, died, in, october, 1593, at, the, age, of, 73, surviving, legal, documents, indicate, she, had, seven, children, could, read, and, write, and, was, a, resourceful, individual, with, a, keen, eye, for, business, when, rodrigo, was, imprisoned, for, debt, from, october, 1553, to, april, 1554, she, supported, the, family, on, her, own, cervantes, siblings, were, andr, s, born, 1543, andrea, born, 1544, luisa, born, 1546, rodrigo, born, 1550, magdalena, born, 1554, and, juan, they, lived, in, c, rdoba, until, 1556, when, his, grandfather, died, for, reasons, that, are, unclear, rodrigo, did, not, benefit, from, his, will, and, the, family, disappears, until, 1564, when, he, filed, a, lawsuit, in, seville, seville, was, then, in, the, midst, of, an, economic, boom, and, rodrigo, managed, rented, accommodation, for, his, elder, brother, andres, who, was, a, junior, magistrate, it, is, contended, that, cervantes, attended, the, jesuit, college, in, seville, where, one, of, the, teachers, was, jesuit, playwright, pedro, pablo, acevedo, who, moved, there, in, 1561, from, c, rdoba, however, legal, records, show, his, father, got, into, debt, once, more, and, in, 1566, the, family, moved, to, madrid, in, the, 19th, century, a, biographer, discovered, an, arrest, warrant, for, a, miguel, de, cervantes, dated, 15, september, 1569, who, was, charged, with, wounding, antonio, de, sigura, in, a, duel, although, disputed, at, the, time, largely, on, the, grounds, such, behaviour, was, unworthy, of, so, great, an, author, it, is, now, accepted, as, the, most, likely, reason, for, cervantes, leaving, madrid, he, eventually, made, his, way, to, rome, where, he, found, a, position, in, the, household, of, giulio, acquaviva, an, italian, bishop, who, spent, 1568, to, 1569, in, madrid, and, was, appointed, cardinal, in, 1570, when, the, 1570, to, 1573, ottoman, venetian, war, began, spain, formed, part, of, the, holy, league, a, coalition, formed, to, support, the, venetian, republic, possibly, seeing, an, opportunity, to, have, his, arrest, warrant, rescinded, cervantes, went, to, naples, then, part, of, the, crown, of, aragon, the, military, commander, in, naples, was, lvaro, de, sande, a, friend, of, the, family, who, gave, cervantes, a, commission, in, the, tercio, of, sicily, under, the, marqu, s, de, santa, cruz, at, some, point, he, was, joined, in, naples, by, his, younger, brother, rodrigo, in, september, 1571, cervantes, sailed, on, board, the, marquesa, part, of, the, holy, league, fleet, under, don, john, of, austria, illegitimate, half, brother, of, phillip, ii, of, spain, on, 7, october, they, defeated, the, ottoman, fleet, at, the, battle, of, lepanto, this, landmark, sea, battle, the, most, significant, naval, conflict, since, the, roman, battle, of, actium, 32, b, c, stopped, muslim, incursion, into, europe, and, for, the, first, time, allowed, european, christians, to, feel, that, they, were, not, to, be, overrun, by, islam, according, to, his, own, account, although, suffering, from, malaria, cervantes, was, given, command, of, a, 12, man, skiff, a, small, boat, used, for, assaulting, enemy, galleys, the, marquesa, lost, 40, dead, and, 120, wounded, including, cervantes, who, received, three, separate, wounds, two, in, the, chest, and, another, that, rendered, his, left, arm, useless, this, last, wound, is, the, reason, why, he, later, was, called, el, manco, de, lepanto, english, the, one, handed, man, of, lepanto, the, one, armed, man, of, lepanto, a, title, that, followed, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, his, actions, at, lepanto, were, a, source, of, pride, to, the, end, of, his, life, while, don, john, approved, no, less, than, four, separate, pay, increases, for, him, in, journey, to, parnassus, published, two, years, before, his, death, in, 1616, cervantes, claimed, to, have, lost, the, movement, of, the, left, hand, for, the, glory, of, the, right, as, with, much, else, the, extent, of, his, disability, is, unclear, the, only, source, being, cervantes, himself, while, commentators, cite, his, habitual, tendency, to, praise, himself, however, they, were, serious, enough, to, earn, him, six, months, in, the, civic, hospital, at, messina, sicily, although, he, returned, to, service, in, july, 1572, in, the, tercio, de, figueroa, records, show, his, chest, wounds, were, still, not, completely, healed, in, february, 1573, based, mainly, in, naples, he, joined, expeditions, to, corfu, and, navarino, and, took, part, in, the, 1573, occupation, of, tunis, and, la, goulette, which, were, recaptured, by, the, ottomans, in, 1574, despite, lepanto, the, war, overall, was, an, ottoman, victory, and, the, loss, of, tunis, a, military, disaster, for, spain, cervantes, returned, to, palermo, where, he, was, paid, off, by, the, duke, of, sessa, who, gave, him, letters, of, commendation, in, early, september, 1575, cervantes, and, rodrigo, left, naples, on, the, galley, sol, as, they, approached, barcelona, on, 26, september, their, ship, was, captured, by, ottoman, corsairs, and, the, brothers, taken, to, algiers, to, be, sold, as, slaves, or, as, was, the, case, of, cervantes, and, his, brother, held, for, ransom, if, this, would, be, more, lucrative, than, their, sale, as, slaves, rodrigo, was, ransomed, in, 1577, but, his, family, could, not, afford, the, fee, for, cervantes, who, was, forced, to, remain, turkish, historian, rasih, nuri, leri, found, evidence, suggesting, cervantes, worked, on, the, construction, of, the, k, l, ali, pasha, complex, which, means, he, spent, at, least, part, of, his, captivity, in, istanbul, this, is, yet, to, be, proven, and, no, evidence, has, been, published, on, the, matter, by, 1580, spain, was, occupied, with, integrating, portugal, and, suppressing, the, dutch, revolt, while, the, ottomans, were, at, war, with, persia, the, two, sides, agreed, a, truce, leading, to, an, improvement, of, relations, after, almost, five, years, and, four, escape, attempts, in, 1580, cervantes, was, set, free, by, the, trinitarians, a, religious, charity, that, specialised, in, ransoming, christian, captives, and, returned, to, madrid, while, cervantes, was, in, captivity, both, don, john, and, the, duke, of, sessa, died, depriving, him, of, two, potential, patrons, while, the, spanish, economy, was, in, dire, straits, this, made, finding, employment, difficult, other, than, a, period, in, 1581, to, 1582, when, he, was, employed, as, an, intelligence, agent, in, north, africa, little, is, known, of, his, movements, prior, to, 1584, in, april, of, that, year, cervantes, visited, esquivias, to, help, arrange, the, affairs, of, his, recently, deceased, friend, and, minor, poet, pedro, la, nez, there, he, met, catalina, de, salazar, y, palacios, c, 1566, 1626, eldest, daughter, of, the, widowed, catalina, de, palacios, her, husband, died, leaving, only, debts, but, the, elder, catalina, owned, some, land, of, her, own, this, may, be, why, in, december, 1584, cervantes, married, her, daughter, then, between, 15, and, 18, years, old, the, first, use, of, the, name, cervantes, saavedra, appears, in, 1586, on, documents, related, to, their, marriage, shortly, before, this, his, illegitimate, daughter, isabel, was, born, in, november, her, mother, ana, franca, was, the, wife, of, a, madrid, innkeeper, they, apparently, concealed, it, from, her, husband, but, cervantes, acknowledged, paternity, when, ana, franca, died, in, 1598, he, asked, his, sister, magdalena, to, take, care, of, his, daughter, in, 1587, cervantes, was, appointed, as, a, government, purchasing, agent, commissary, of, the, royal, galleons, in, seville, obtaining, wheat, and, oil, for, the, doomed, spanish, armada, he, became, a, tax, collector, in, 1592, and, was, briefly, jailed, for, irregularities, in, his, accounts, but, quickly, released, several, applications, for, positions, in, spanish, america, were, rejected, i, e, to, the, council, of, indies, in, 1590, though, modern, critics, note, images, of, the, colonies, appear, in, his, work, from, 1596, to, 1600, he, lived, primarily, in, seville, then, returned, to, madrid, in, 1606, where, he, remained, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, later, years, he, received, some, financial, support, from, the, count, of, lemos, although, he, was, not, included, in, the, retinue, lemos, took, to, naples, when, appointed, viceroy, in, 1608, in, july, 1613, he, joined, the, third, order, franciscans, then, a, common, way, for, catholics, to, gain, spiritual, merit, it, is, generally, accepted, cervantes, died, on, 22, april, 1616, ns, the, gregorian, calendar, had, superseded, the, julian, in, 1582, in, spain, and, some, other, countries, the, symptoms, described, including, intense, thirst, correspond, to, diabetes, then, untreatable, in, accordance, with, his, will, cervantes, was, buried, in, the, convent, of, the, barefoot, trinitarians, in, central, madrid, his, remains, went, missing, when, moved, during, rebuilding, work, at, the, convent, in, 1673, and, in, 2014, historian, fernando, de, prado, launched, a, project, to, rediscover, them, in, january, 2015, francisco, etxeberria, the, forensic, anthropologist, leading, the, search, reported, the, discovery, of, caskets, containing, bone, fragments, and, part, of, a, board, with, the, letters, m, c, based, on, evidence, of, injuries, suffered, at, lepanto, on, 17, march, 2015, they, were, confirmed, as, belonging, to, cervantes, along, with, his, wife, and, others, they, were, formally, reburied, at, a, public, ceremony, in, june, 2015, no, authenticated, portrait, of, cervantes, is, known, to, exist, the, one, most, often, associated, with, the, author, is, attributed, to, juan, de, j, uregui, but, both, names, were, added, at, a, later, date, the, el, greco, painting, in, the, museo, del, prado, known, as, retrato, de, un, caballero, desconocido, portrait, of, an, unknown, gentleman, is, cited, as, possibly, depicting, cervantes, but, there, is, no, evidence, for, this, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, portrait, the, nobleman, with, his, hand, on, his, chest, also, by, el, greco, may, possibly, depict, cervantes, however, the, prado, itself, while, mentioning, in, passing, that, specific, names, have, been, proposed, for, the, sitter, including, that, of, cervantes, and, even, that, the, painting, could, be, a, self, portrait, goes, on, to, state, that, without, doubt, the, most, convincing, suggestion, has, connected, this, figure, with, the, second, marquis, of, montemayor, juan, de, silva, y, de, ribera, a, contemporary, of, el, greco, who, was, appointed, military, commander, of, the, alc, zar, in, toledo, by, philip, ii, and, chief, notary, to, the, crown, a, position, that, would, explain, the, solemn, gesture, of, the, hand, depicted, in, the, act, of, taking, an, oath, the, portrait, by, luis, de, madrazo, at, the, biblioteca, nacional, de, espa, a, painted, in, 1859, was, based, on, his, imagination, the, image, that, appears, on, spanish, euro, coins, of, 0, 10, 0, 20, and, 0, 50, is, based, on, a, bust, created, in, 1905, cervantes, claimed, to, have, written, over, 20, plays, such, as, el, trato, de, argel, based, on, his, experiences, in, captivity, such, works, were, extremely, short, lived, and, even, lope, de, vega, the, best, known, playwright, of, the, day, could, not, live, on, their, proceeds, in, 1585, he, published, la, galatea, a, conventional, pastoral, romance, that, received, little, contemporary, notice, despite, promising, to, write, a, sequel, he, never, did, so, aside, from, these, and, some, poems, by, 1605, cervantes, had, not, been, published, for, 20, years, in, don, quixote, he, challenged, a, form, of, literature, that, had, been, a, favourite, for, more, than, a, century, explicitly, stating, his, purpose, was, to, undermine, vain, and, empty, chivalric, romances, his, portrayal, of, real, life, and, use, of, everyday, speech, in, a, literary, context, was, considered, innovative, and, proved, instantly, popular, first, published, in, january, 1605, don, quixote, and, sancho, panza, featured, in, masquerades, held, to, celebrate, the, birth, of, philip, iv, on, 8, april, he, finally, achieved, a, degree, of, financial, security, while, its, popularity, led, to, demands, for, a, sequel, in, the, foreword, to, his, 1613, work, novelas, ejemplares, dedicated, to, his, patron, the, count, of, lemos, cervantes, promises, to, produce, one, but, was, pre, empted, by, an, unauthorised, version, published, in, 1614, published, under, the, name, alonso, fern, ndez, de, avellaneda, it, is, possible, this, delay, was, deliberate, to, ensure, support, from, his, publisher, and, reading, public, cervantes, finally, produced, the, second, part, of, don, quixote, in, 1615, the, two, parts, of, don, quixote, are, different, in, focus, but, similar, in, their, clarity, of, prose, and, their, realism, the, first, was, more, comic, and, had, greater, popular, appeal, the, second, part, is, often, considered, more, sophisticated, and, complex, with, a, greater, depth, of, characterisation, and, philosophical, insight, in, addition, to, this, he, produced, a, series, of, works, between, 1613, and, his, death, in, 1616, they, include, a, collection, of, tales, titled, exemplary, novels, this, was, followed, by, viaje, del, parnaso, eight, comedies, and, eight, new, interludes, and, los, trabajos, de, persiles, y, sigismunda, completed, just, before, his, death, and, published, posthumously, in, january, 1617, cervantes, was, rediscovered, by, english, writers, in, the, mid, 18th, century, the, literary, editor, john, bowle, argued, that, cervantes, was, as, significant, as, any, of, the, greek, and, roman, authors, then, popular, and, published, an, annotated, edition, in, 1781, now, viewed, as, a, significant, work, at, the, time, it, proved, a, failure, however, don, quixote, has, been, translated, into, all, major, languages, in, 700, editions, mexican, author, carlos, fuentes, suggested, that, cervantes, and, his, contemporary, william, shakespeare, form, part, of, a, narrative, tradition, that, includes, homer, dante, defoe, dickens, balzac, and, joyce, sigmund, freud, claimed, he, learnt, spanish, to, read, cervantes, in, the, original, he, particularly, admired, the, dialogue, of, the, dogs, el, coloquio, de, los, perros, from, exemplary, tales, in, which, two, dogs, cipi, n, and, berganza, share, their, stories, as, one, talks, the, other, listens, occasionally, making, comments, from, 1871, to, 1881, freud, and, his, close, friend, eduard, silberstein, wrote, letters, to, each, other, using, the, pen, names, cipi, n, and, berganza, in, 1905, the, tricentennial, of, the, publication, of, don, quixote, was, marked, with, celebrations, in, spain, the, 400th, anniversary, of, his, death, in, 2016, saw, the, production, of, cervantina, a, celebration, of, his, plays, by, the, compa, a, nacional, de, teatro, cl, sico, in, madrid, man, of, la, mancha, the, 1965, musical, was, loosely, based, on, cervantes, life, the, miguel, de, cervantes, virtual, library, is, the, world, s, largest, digital, archive, of, spanish, language, historical, and, literary, works, as, listed, in, complete, works, of, miguel, de, cervantes, cervantes, is, generally, considered, a, mediocre, poet, few, of, his, poems, survive, some, appear, in, la, galatea, while, he, also, wrote, dos, canciones, la, armada, invencible, his, sonnets, include, al, t, mulo, del, rey, felipe, en, sevilla, canto, de, cal, ope, and, ep, stola, a, mateo, v, zquez, viaje, del, parnaso, or, journey, to, parnassus, is, his, most, ambitious, verse, work, an, allegory, that, consists, largely, of, reviews, of, contemporary, poets, he, published, a, number, of, dramatic, works, including, ten, extant, full, length, plays, he, also, wrote, eight, short, farces, entremeses, these, plays, and, short, farces, except, for, trato, de, argel, and, la, numancia, made, up, ocho, comedias, y, ocho, entrem, ses, nuevos, nunca, representados, eight, comedies, and, eight, new, interludes, never, before, performed, which, appeared, in, 1615, the, dates, and, order, of, composition, of, cervantes, s, short, farces, are, unknown, faithful, to, the, spirit, of, lope, de, rueda, cervantes, endowed, them, with, novelistic, elements, such, as, simplified, plot, the, type, of, descriptions, normally, associated, with, a, novel, and, character, development, cervantes, included, some, of, his, dramas, among, the, works, he, was, most, satisfied, with
