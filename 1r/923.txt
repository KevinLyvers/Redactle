june, 328, 2, may, 373, of, which, over, 17, encompassed, five, exiles, when, he, was, replaced, on, the, order, of, four, different, roman, emperors, athanasius, was, a, church, father, the, chief, proponent, of, nicene, theology, against, the, anti, nicenes, and, a, noted, egyptian, christian, leader, of, the, fourth, century, conflict, with, the, eusebians, as, well, as, with, successive, roman, emperors, shaped, athanasius, s, career, in, 325, at, age, 27, athanasius, began, his, leading, role, against, the, arians, as, a, deacon, and, assistant, to, bishop, alexander, of, alexandria, he, did, not, yet, play, an, important, role, at, the, first, council, of, nicaea, roman, emperor, constantine, the, great, had, convened, the, council, in, may, august, 325, to, heal, the, division, in, the, church, caused, by, the, dispute, between, alexander, and, arius, three, years, after, that, council, athanasius, succeeded, his, mentor, as, patriarch, of, alexandria, in, addition, to, the, conflict, with, the, eusebians, including, powerful, and, influential, churchmen, led, by, eusebius, of, nicomedia, he, struggled, against, the, emperors, constantine, constantius, ii, julian, the, apostate, and, valens, he, was, known, as, athanasius, contra, mundum, latin, for, athanasius, against, the, world, at, the, council, of, tyre, in, 335, he, was, condemned, and, exiled, for, violence, against, the, melitians, in, his, see, nonetheless, within, a, few, years, of, his, death, gregory, of, nazianzus, called, him, the, pillar, of, the, church, his, writings, were, well, regarded, by, subsequent, church, fathers, in, the, west, and, the, east, who, noted, their, devotion, to, the, word, become, man, pastoral, concern, and, interest, in, monasticism, athanasius, is, considered, one, of, the, four, great, eastern, doctors, of, the, church, in, the, catholic, church, some, argue, that, in, his, easter, letter, of, 367, athanasius, was, the, first, person, to, list, the, 27, books, of, the, new, testament, canon, that, are, in, use, today, others, argue, that, origen, of, alexandria, was, the, first, to, list, the, twenty, seven, books, of, the, new, testament, in, his, homilies, on, joshua, only, there, is, a, textual, variant, as, to, whether, or, not, he, included, revelation, athanasius, is, venerated, as, a, saint, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, catholic, church, the, coptic, orthodox, church, the, anglican, communion, and, lutheranism, athanasius, was, born, to, a, christian, family, in, alexandria, or, possibly, the, nearby, nile, delta, town, of, damanhur, sometime, between, 293, and, 298, the, earlier, date, is, sometimes, assigned, because, of, the, maturity, revealed, in, his, two, earliest, treatises, contra, gentes, against, the, heathens, and, de, incarnatione, on, the, incarnation, which, were, likely, written, circa, 318, before, the, dispute, between, alexander, and, arius, had, begun, as, those, writings, do, not, show, an, awareness, that, dispute, however, cornelius, clifford, places, his, birth, no, earlier, than, 296, and, no, later, than, 298, based, on, the, fact, that, athanasius, indicates, no, first, hand, recollection, of, the, maximian, persecution, of, 303, which, he, suggests, athanasius, would, have, remembered, if, he, had, been, ten, years, old, at, the, time, secondly, the, festal, epistles, state, that, his, opponents, had, accused, athanasius, among, other, charges, of, not, having, yet, attained, the, canonical, age, 35, and, thus, could, not, have, been, properly, ordained, as, patriarch, of, alexandria, in, 328, the, accusation, must, have, seemed, plausible, the, orthodox, church, places, his, year, of, birth, around, 297, his, parents, were, wealthy, enough, to, give, him, a, fine, secular, education, he, was, nevertheless, clearly, not, a, member, of, the, egyptian, aristocracy, some, western, scholars, consider, his, command, of, greek, in, which, he, wrote, most, if, not, all, of, his, surviving, works, evidence, that, he, may, have, been, a, greek, born, in, alexandria, historical, evidence, however, indicates, that, he, was, fluent, in, coptic, as, well, given, the, regions, of, egypt, where, he, preached, some, surviving, copies, of, his, writings, are, in, fact, in, coptic, though, scholars, differ, as, to, whether, he, wrote, them, in, coptic, originally, which, would, make, him, the, first, patriarch, to, do, so, or, whether, these, were, translations, of, writings, originally, in, greek, rufinus, relates, a, story, that, as, bishop, alexander, stood, by, a, window, he, watched, boys, playing, on, the, seashore, below, imitating, the, ritual, of, christian, baptism, he, sent, for, the, children, and, discovered, that, one, of, the, boys, athanasius, had, acted, as, bishop, after, questioning, athanasius, bishop, alexander, informed, him, that, the, baptisms, were, genuine, as, both, the, form, and, matter, of, the, sacrament, had, been, performed, through, the, recitation, of, the, correct, words, and, the, administration, of, water, and, that, he, must, not, continue, to, do, this, as, those, baptized, had, not, been, properly, catechized, he, invited, athanasius, and, his, playfellows, to, prepare, for, clerical, careers, alexandria, was, the, most, important, trade, centre, in, the, empire, during, athanasius, s, boyhood, intellectually, morally, and, politically, it, epitomized, the, ethnically, diverse, greco, roman, world, even, more, than, rome, or, constantinople, antioch, or, marseilles, its, famous, catechetical, school, while, sacrificing, none, of, its, famous, passion, for, orthodoxy, since, the, days, of, pantaenus, clement, of, alexandria, origen, dionysius, and, theognostus, had, begun, to, take, on, an, almost, secular, character, in, the, comprehensiveness, of, its, interests, and, had, counted, influential, pagans, among, its, serious, auditors, peter, of, alexandria, the, 17th, archbishop, of, alexandria, was, martyred, in, 311, in, the, closing, days, of, the, great, persecution, and, may, have, been, one, of, athanasius, s, teachers, his, successor, as, bishop, of, alexandria, was, alexander, of, alexandria, according, to, sozomen, the, bishop, alexander, invited, athanasius, to, be, his, commensal, and, secretary, he, had, been, well, educated, and, was, versed, in, grammar, and, rhetoric, and, had, already, while, still, a, young, man, and, before, reaching, the, episcopate, given, proof, to, those, who, dwelt, with, him, of, his, wisdom, and, acumen, soz, ii, xvii, athanasius, earliest, work, against, the, heathen, on, the, incarnation, written, before, 319, bears, traces, of, origenist, alexandrian, thought, but, in, an, orthodox, way, athanasius, was, also, familiar, with, the, theories, of, various, philosophical, schools, and, in, particular, with, the, developments, of, neoplatonism, ultimately, athanasius, would, modify, the, philosophical, thought, of, the, school, of, alexandria, away, from, the, origenist, principles, such, as, the, entirely, allegorical, interpretation, of, the, text, still, in, later, works, athanasius, quotes, homer, more, than, once, hist, ar, 68, orat, iv, 29, athanasius, knew, greek, and, admitted, not, knowing, hebrew, the, old, testament, passages, he, quotes, frequently, come, from, the, septuagint, greek, translation, only, rarely, did, he, use, other, greek, versions, to, aquila, once, in, the, ecthesis, to, other, versions, once, or, twice, on, the, psalms, and, his, knowledge, of, the, old, testament, was, limited, to, the, septuagint, bishop, or, patriarch, the, highest, ecclesial, rank, in, the, centre, of, the, church, in, alexandria, alexander, ordained, athanasius, a, deacon, in, 319, in, 325, athanasius, served, as, alexander, s, secretary, at, the, first, council, of, nicaea, already, a, recognized, theologian, and, ascetic, he, was, the, obvious, choice, to, replace, his, ageing, mentor, alexander, as, the, pope, of, alexandria, despite, the, opposition, of, the, followers, of, arius, and, meletius, of, lycopolis, at, length, in, the, council, of, nicaea, the, term, consubstantial, homoousion, was, adopted, and, a, formulary, of, faith, embodying, it, was, drawn, up, by, hosius, of, c, rdoba, from, this, time, to, the, end, of, the, arian, controversies, the, word, consubstantial, continued, to, be, the, test, of, orthodoxy, the, formulary, of, faith, drawn, up, by, hosius, is, known, as, the, nicene, creed, 232, however, he, was, not, the, originator, of, the, famous, homoousion, acc, of, homoousios, the, term, had, been, proposed, in, a, non, obvious, and, illegitimate, sense, by, paul, of, samosata, to, the, fathers, at, antioch, and, had, been, rejected, by, them, as, savouring, of, materialistic, conceptions, of, the, godhead, and, sabellianism, while, still, a, deacon, under, alexander, s, care, or, early, in, his, patriarchate, as, discussed, below, athanasius, may, have, also, become, acquainted, with, some, of, the, solitaries, of, the, egyptian, desert, and, in, particular, anthony, the, great, whose, life, he, is, said, to, have, written, in, about, 319, when, athanasius, was, a, deacon, a, presbyter, named, arius, came, into, a, direct, conflict, with, alexander, of, alexandria, it, appears, that, arius, reproached, alexander, for, what, he, felt, were, misguided, or, heretical, teachings, being, taught, by, the, bishop, at, the, time, subordinationism, was, orthodox, and, arius, embraced, a, subordinationist, christology, even, athanasius, taught, a, form, of, subordination, but, arius, taught, that, christ, the, divine, son, logos, of, god, was, made, out, of, nothing, not, begotten, which, the, eusebians, also, opposed, arius, had, support, from, the, two, most, influential, bishops, at, the, time, eusebius, of, nicomedia, and, eusebius, of, caesarea, however, they, were, not, followers, of, arius, they, supported, him, because, they, thought, that, alexander, s, theology, was, even, more, dangerous, arius, was, subsequently, excommunicated, by, alexander, and, arius, began, to, elicit, the, support, of, many, bishops, who, joined, in, opposition, to, alexander, 297, frances, a, m, forbes, writes, that, when, patriarch, alexander, was, on, his, death, bed, he, called, athanasius, who, fled, fearing, he, would, be, constrained, to, be, made, bishop, when, the, bishops, of, the, church, assembled, to, elect, their, new, patriarch, the, whole, catholic, population, surrounded, the, church, holding, up, their, hands, to, heaven, and, crying, give, us, athanasius, the, bishops, had, nothing, better, athanasius, was, thus, elected, as, gregory, tells, us, pope, gregory, i, had, full, access, to, the, vatican, archives, chapter, 4, alban, butler, writes, on, the, subject, five, months, after, this, great, council, nicae, st, alexander, lying, on, his, deathbed, recommended, to, his, clergy, and, people, the, choice, of, athanasius, for, his, successor, thrice, repeating, his, name, in, consequence, of, his, recommendation, the, bishops, of, all, egypt, assembled, at, alexandria, and, finding, the, people, and, clergy, unanimous, in, their, choice, of, athanasius, for, patriarch, they, confirmed, the, election, about, the, middle, of, year, 326, he, seems, then, to, have, been, about, thirty, years, of, age, t, gilmartin, professor, of, history, maynooth, 1890, writes, on, the, death, of, alexander, five, months, after, the, termination, of, the, council, of, nicaea, athanasius, was, unanimously, elected, to, fill, the, vacant, see, he, was, most, unwilling, to, accept, the, dignity, for, he, clearly, foresaw, the, difficulties, in, which, it, would, involve, him, the, clergy, and, people, were, determined, to, have, him, as, their, bishop, patriarch, of, alexandria, and, refused, to, accept, any, excuses, he, at, length, consented, to, accept, a, responsibility, that, he, sought, in, vain, to, escape, and, was, consecrated, in, 326, when, he, was, about, thirty, years, of, age, 244, 248, athanasius, episcopate, began, on, 9, may, 328, as, the, alexandrian, council, elected, athanasius, to, succeed, after, the, death, of, alexander, 245, patriarch, athanasius, spent, over, 17, years, in, five, exiles, ordered, by, four, different, roman, emperors, not, counting, approximately, six, more, incidents, in, which, athanasius, fled, alexandria, to, escape, people, seeking, to, take, his, life, during, his, first, years, as, bishop, athanasius, visited, the, churches, of, his, territory, which, at, that, time, included, all, of, egypt, and, libya, he, established, contacts, with, the, hermits, and, monks, of, the, desert, including, pachomius, which, proved, very, valuable, to, him, over, the, years, during, the, forty, eight, years, of, his, episcopate, his, history, is, told, in, the, history, of, the, controversies, in, which, he, was, constantly, engaged, with, the, arians, and, of, the, sufferings, he, had, to, endure, in, defence, of, the, nicene, faith, we, have, seen, that, when, arius, was, allowed, to, return, from, exile, in, 328, athanasius, refused, to, remove, the, sentence, of, excommunication, 245, athanasius, first, problem, lay, with, meletius, of, lycopolis, and, his, followers, who, had, failed, to, abide, by, the, first, council, of, nicaea, that, council, also, anathematized, arius, accused, of, mistreating, arians, and, meletians, athanasius, answered, those, charges, at, a, gathering, of, bishops, at, the, first, synod, of, tyre, in, 335, there, eusebius, of, nicomedia, and, other, supporters, of, arius, deposed, athanasius, on, 6, november, both, sides, of, the, dispute, met, with, emperor, constantine, i, in, constantinople, at, that, meeting, the, arians, claimed, athanasius, would, try, to, cut, off, essential, egyptian, grain, supplies, to, constantinople, he, was, found, guilty, and, sent, into, exile, to, augusta, treverorum, in, gaul, now, trier, in, germany, when, athanasius, reached, his, destination, in, exile, in, 336, maximin, of, trier, received, him, but, not, as, a, disgraced, person, athanasius, stayed, with, him, for, two, years, constantine, died, in, 337, and, was, succeeded, by, his, three, sons, constantine, ii, constantius, and, constans, paul, i, of, constantinople, had, cautioned, emperor, constans, against, the, arians, revealing, their, plots, and, he, also, had, been, banished, and, found, shelter, with, maximin, when, emperor, constantine, i, died, athanasius, was, allowed, to, return, to, his, see, of, alexandria, shortly, thereafter, however, constantius, ii, renewed, the, order, for, athanasius, s, banishment, in, 338, within, a, few, weeks, he, set, out, for, rome, to, lay, his, case, before, the, church, at, large, he, had, made, his, appeal, to, pope, julius, who, took, up, his, cause, with, whole, heartedness, that, never, wavered, down, to, the, day, of, that, holy, pontiff, s, death, the, pope, summoned, a, synod, of, bishops, to, meet, in, rome, after, a, careful, and, detailed, examination, of, the, entire, case, the, primate, s, innocence, was, proclaimed, to, the, christian, world, during, this, time, gregory, of, cappadocia, an, arian, bishop, was, installed, as, the, patriarch, of, alexandria, usurping, the, absent, athanasius, athanasius, did, however, remain, in, contact, with, his, people, through, his, annual, festal, letters, in, which, he, also, announced, on, which, date, easter, would, be, celebrated, that, year, in, 339, or, 340, nearly, one, hundred, bishops, met, at, alexandria, declared, in, favour, of, athanasius, and, vigorously, rejected, the, criticisms, of, the, eusebian, faction, at, tyre, plus, pope, julius, wrote, to, the, supporters, of, arius, strongly, urging, athanasius, s, reinstatement, but, that, effort, proved, in, vain, julius, called, a, synod, in, rome, in, 340, to, address, the, matter, which, proclaimed, athanasius, the, rightful, bishop, of, alexandria, early, in, 343, athanasius, met, with, hosius, of, c, rdoba, and, together, they, set, out, for, serdica, a, full, council, of, the, church, was, summoned, there, in, deference, to, the, roman, pontiff, s, wishes, at, this, great, gathering, of, prelates, leaders, of, the, church, the, case, of, athanasius, was, taken, up, once, more, that, is, athanasius, was, formally, questioned, over, misdemeanours, and, even, murder, a, bishop, in, egypt, named, arsenius, had, turned, up, missing, and, they, blamed, his, death, on, athanasius, even, supposedly, producing, arsenius, severed, hand, the, council, was, convoked, for, the, purpose, of, inquiring, into, the, charges, against, athanasius, and, other, bishops, on, account, of, which, they, were, deposed, from, their, sees, by, the, semi, arian, synod, of, antioch, in, 341, and, went, into, exile, eusebian, bishops, objected, to, the, admission, of, athanasius, and, other, deposed, bishops, to, the, council, except, as, accused, persons, to, answer, the, charges, brought, against, them, their, objections, were, overridden, by, the, orthodox, bishops, the, eusebians, seeing, they, had, no, chance, of, having, their, views, carried, retired, to, philippopolis, in, thrace, where, they, held, an, opposition, council, under, the, presidency, of, the, patriarch, of, antioch, and, confirmed, the, decrees, of, the, synod, of, antioch, 233, 234, athanasius, innocence, was, reaffirmed, at, the, council, of, serdica, two, conciliar, letters, were, prepared, one, to, the, clergy, and, faithful, of, alexandria, the, other, to, the, bishops, of, egypt, and, libya, in, which, the, will, of, the, council, was, made, known, meanwhile, the, eusebians, issued, an, anathema, against, athanasius, and, his, supporters, the, persecution, against, the, orthodox, party, broke, out, with, renewed, vigour, and, constantius, was, induced, to, prepare, drastic, measures, against, athanasius, and, the, priests, who, were, devoted, to, him, orders, were, given, that, if, athanasius, attempted, to, re, enter, his, see, he, should, be, put, to, death, athanasius, accordingly, withdrew, from, serdica, to, naissus, in, mysia, where, he, celebrated, the, easter, festival, of, the, year, 344, hosius, presided, over, the, council, of, serdica, as, he, did, for, the, first, council, of, nicaea, which, like, the, 341, synod, found, athanasius, innocent, he, celebrated, his, last, easter, in, exile, in, aquileia, in, april, 345, received, by, bishop, fortunatianus, the, council, of, serdica, sent, an, emissary, to, report, their, finding, to, constantius, constantius, reconsidered, his, decision, owing, to, a, threatening, letter, from, his, brother, constans, and, the, uncertain, conditions, of, affairs, on, the, persian, border, and, he, accordingly, made, up, his, mind, to, yield, but, three, separate, letters, were, needed, to, overcome, the, natural, hesitation, of, athanasius, when, he, finally, acquiesced, to, meet, with, constantius, he, was, accorded, a, gracious, interview, by, the, emperor, and, sent, back, to, his, see, in, triumph, and, began, ten, years, of, peace, pope, julius, died, in, april, 352, and, was, succeeded, by, liberius, for, two, years, liberius, had, been, favourable, to, the, cause, of, athanasius, but, driven, at, last, into, exile, he, was, induced, to, sign, an, ambiguous, formula, from, which, the, great, nicene, text, the, homoousion, had, been, studiously, omitted, in, 355, a, council, was, held, at, milan, where, in, spite, of, the, vigorous, opposition, of, a, handful, of, loyal, prelates, among, the, western, bishops, a, fourth, condemnation, of, athanasius, was, announced, to, the, world, with, his, friends, scattered, hosius, in, exile, and, pope, liberius, denounced, as, acquiescing, in, arian, formularies, athanasius, could, hardly, hope, to, escape, on, the, night, of, 8, february, 356, while, engaged, in, services, in, the, church, of, st, thomas, a, band, of, armed, men, burst, in, to, secure, his, arrest, it, was, the, beginning, of, his, third, exile, gilmartin, writes, by, constantius, order, the, sole, ruler, of, the, roman, empire, at, the, death, of, his, brother, constans, the, council, of, arles, in, 353, was, held, which, was, presided, over, by, vincent, bishop, of, capua, in, the, name, of, pope, liberius, the, fathers, terrified, of, the, threats, of, the, emperor, an, avowed, arian, they, consented, to, the, condemnation, of, athanasius, the, pope, refused, to, accept, their, decision, and, requested, the, emperor, to, hold, another, council, in, which, the, charges, against, athanasius, could, be, freely, investigated, to, this, constantius, consented, for, he, felt, able, to, control, the, council, in, milan, 234, in, 355, three, hundred, bishops, assembled, in, milan, most, from, the, west, and, only, a, few, from, the, east, they, met, in, the, church, of, milan, shortly, the, emperor, ordered, them, to, a, hall, in, the, imperial, palace, thus, ending, any, free, debate, he, presented, an, arian, formula, of, faith, for, their, acceptance, he, threatened, any, who, refused, with, exile, and, death, all, with, the, exception, of, dionysius, bishop, of, milan, and, the, two, papal, legates, viz, eusebius, of, vercelli, and, lucifer, of, cagliari, consented, to, the, arian, creed, and, the, condemnation, of, athanasius, those, who, refused, were, sent, into, exile, the, decrees, were, forwarded, to, the, pope, for, approval, but, were, rejected, because, of, the, violence, to, which, the, bishops, were, subjected, 235, through, the, influence, of, the, eusebian, faction, at, constantinople, an, arian, bishop, george, of, cappadocia, was, appointed, to, rule, the, see, of, alexandria, in, 356, athanasius, after, remaining, some, days, in, the, neighbourhood, of, the, city, finally, withdrew, into, the, desert, of, upper, egypt, where, he, remained, for, a, period, of, six, years, living, the, life, of, the, monks, and, devoting, himself, to, the, composition, of, a, group, of, writings, such, as, his, letter, to, the, monks, and, four, orations, against, the, arians, he, also, defended, his, own, recent, conduct, in, the, apology, to, constantius, and, apology, for, his, flight, constantius, persistence, in, his, opposition, to, athanasius, combined, with, reports, athanasius, received, about, the, persecution, of, non, arians, by, the, arian, bishop, george, of, laodicea, prompted, athanasius, to, write, his, more, emotional, history, of, the, arians, in, which, he, described, constantius, as, a, precursor, of, the, antichrist, constantius, died, on, 4, november, 361, and, was, succeeded, by, julian, the, proclamation, of, the, new, prince, s, accession, was, the, signal, for, a, pagan, outbreak, against, the, still, dominant, arian, faction, in, alexandria, george, the, usurping, bishop, was, imprisoned, and, murdered, an, obscure, presbyter, named, pistus, was, chosen, by, the, arians, to, succeed, him, when, news, arrived, that, filled, the, orthodox, party, with, hope, an, edict, had, been, put, forth, by, julian, permitting, the, exiled, bishops, of, the, galileans, to, return, to, their, towns, and, provinces, athanasius, accordingly, returned, to, alexandria, on, 22, february, 362, in, 362, athanasius, convened, a, council, at, alexandria, and, presided, over, it, with, eusebius, of, vercelli, athanasius, appealed, for, unity, among, all, those, who, had, faith, in, christianity, even, if, they, differed, on, matters, of, terminology, this, prepared, the, groundwork, for, his, definition, of, the, orthodox, doctrine, of, the, trinity, however, the, council, also, was, directed, against, those, who, denied, the, divinity, of, the, holy, spirit, the, human, soul, of, christ, and, christ, s, divinity, mild, measures, were, agreed, on, for, those, heretic, bishops, who, repented, but, severe, penance, was, decreed, for, the, chief, leaders, of, the, major, heresies, with, characteristic, energy, he, set, to, work, to, re, establish, the, somewhat, shattered, fortunes, of, the, orthodox, party, and, to, purge, the, theological, atmosphere, of, uncertainty, to, clear, up, the, misunderstandings, that, had, arisen, in, the, course, of, the, previous, years, an, attempt, was, made, to, determine, still, further, the, significance, of, the, nicene, formularies, in, the, meanwhile, julian, who, seems, to, have, become, suddenly, jealous, of, the, influence, that, athanasius, was, exercising, at, alexandria, addressed, an, order, to, ecdicius, the, prefect, of, egypt, peremptorily, commanding, the, expulsion, of, the, restored, primate, on, the, ground, that, he, had, not, been, included, in, the, imperial, act, of, clemency, the, edict, was, communicated, to, the, bishop, by, pythicodorus, trico, who, though, described, in, the, chronicon, athanasianum, xxxv, as, a, philosopher, seems, to, have, behaved, with, brutal, insolence, on, 23, october, the, people, gathered, about, the, proscribed, bishop, to, protest, against, the, emperor, s, decree, but, athanasius, urged, them, to, submit, consoling, them, with, the, promise, that, his, absence, would, be, of, short, duration, in, 362, julian, noted, for, his, opposition, to, christianity, ordered, athanasius, to, leave, alexandria, once, again, athanasius, left, for, upper, egypt, remaining, there, with, the, desert, fathers, until, julian, s, death, on, 26, june, 363, athanasius, returned, in, secret, to, alexandria, where, he, received, a, document, from, the, new, emperor, jovian, reinstating, him, once, more, in, his, episcopal, functions, his, first, act, was, to, convene, a, council, which, reaffirmed, the, terms, of, the, nicene, creed, early, in, september, 363, he, set, out, for, antioch, on, the, orontes, bearing, a, synodal, letter, in, which, the, pronouncements, of, this, council, had, been, embodied, at, antioch, he, had, an, interview, with, jovian, who, received, him, graciously, and, even, asked, him, to, prepare, an, exposition, of, the, orthodox, faith, in, february, 364, jovian, died, the, accession, of, emperor, valens, gave, a, fresh, lease, of, life, to, the, arian, party, he, issued, a, decree, banishing, the, bishops, who, had, been, deposed, by, constantius, but, who, had, been, permitted, by, jovian, to, return, to, their, sees, the, news, created, the, greatest, consternation, in, alexandria, and, the, prefect, in, order, to, prevent, a, serious, outbreak, gave, public, assurance, that, the, very, special, case, of, athanasius, would, be, laid, before, the, emperor, but, athanasius, seems, to, have, divined, what, was, preparing, in, secret, against, him, he, quietly, withdrew, from, alexandria, in, october, 364, and, took, up, his, abode, in, a, country, house, outside, the, city, valens, who, seems, to, have, sincerely, dreaded, the, possible, consequences, of, another, popular, outbreak, within, a, few, weeks, issued, orders, allowing, athanasius, to, return, to, his, episcopal, see, some, early, reports, state, that, athanasius, spent, this, period, of, exile, at, his, family, s, ancestral, tomb, in, a, christian, cemetery, after, returning, to, alexandria, athanasius, spent, his, final, years, repairing, all, the, damage, done, during, the, earlier, years, of, violence, dissent, and, exile, he, resumed, writing, and, preaching, undisturbed, and, characteristically, re, emphasized, the, view, of, the, incarnation, which, had, been, defined, at, nicaea, on, 2, may, 373, having, consecrated, peter, ii, one, of, his, presbyters, as, his, successor, athanasius, died, peacefully, in, his, own, bed, surrounded, by, his, clergy, and, faithful, supporters, in, coptic, literature, athanasius, is, the, first, patriarch, of, alexandria, to, use, coptic, as, well, as, greek, in, his, writings, athanasius, was, not, a, speculative, theologian, as, he, states, in, his, first, letters, to, serapion, he, held, on, to, the, tradition, teaching, and, faith, proclaimed, by, the, apostles, and, guarded, by, the, fathers, he, held, that, both, the, son, of, god, and, the, holy, spirit, are, consubstantial, with, the, father, which, had, a, great, deal, of, influence, in, the, development, of, later, doctrines, regarding, the, trinity, athanasius, letter, concerning, the, decrees, of, the, council, of, nicaea, de, decretis, is, an, important, historical, as, well, as, theological, account, of, the, proceedings, of, that, council, examples, of, athanasius, polemical, writings, against, his, theological, opponents, include, orations, against, the, arians, his, defence, of, the, divinity, of, the, holy, spirit, letters, to, serapion, in, the, 360s, and, on, the, holy, spirit, against, macedonianism, and, on, the, incarnation, athanasius, also, authored, a, two, part, work, against, the, heathen, and, the, incarnation, of, the, word, of, god, completed, probably, early, in, his, life, before, the, arian, controversy, they, constitute, the, first, classic, work, of, developed, orthodox, theology, in, the, first, part, athanasius, attacks, several, pagan, practices, and, beliefs, the, second, part, presents, teachings, on, the, redemption, also, in, these, books, athanasius, put, forward, the, belief, referencing, john, 1, 1, 4, that, the, son, of, god, the, eternal, word, logos, through, whom, god, created, the, world, entered, that, world, in, human, form, to, lead, men, back, into, the, harmony, from, which, they, had, earlier, fallen, away, his, other, important, works, include, his, letters, to, serapion, which, defends, the, divinity, of, the, holy, spirit, in, a, letter, to, epictetus, of, corinth, athanasius, anticipates, future, controversies, in, his, defence, of, the, humanity, of, christ, in, a, letter, addressed, to, the, monk, dracontius, athanasius, urges, him, to, leave, the, desert, for, the, more, active, duties, of, a, bishop, athanasius, also, wrote, several, works, of, biblical, exegesis, primarily, on, old, testament, materials, the, most, important, of, these, is, his, epistle, to, marcellinus, pg, 27, 12, 45, on, how, to, incorporate, psalm, saying, into, one, s, spiritual, practice, perhaps, his, most, notable, letter, was, his, festal, letter, written, to, his, church, in, alexandria, when, he, was, in, exile, as, he, could, not, be, in, their, presence, this, letter, clearly, shows, his, stand, that, accepting, jesus, as, the, divine, son, of, god, is, not, optional, but, necessary, i, know, moreover, that, not, only, this, thing, saddens, you, but, also, the, fact, that, while, others, have, obtained, the, churches, by, violence, you, are, meanwhile, cast, out, from, your, places, for, they, hold, the, places, but, you, the, apostolic, faith, they, are, it, is, true, in, the, places, but, outside, of, the, true, faith, while, you, are, outside, the, places, indeed, but, the, faith, within, you, let, us, consider, whether, is, the, greater, the, place, or, the, faith, clearly, the, true, faith, who, then, has, lost, more, or, who, possesses, more, he, who, holds, the, place, or, he, who, holds, the, faith, his, biography, of, anthony, the, great, entitled, life, of, antony, vita, antonii, became, his, most, widely, read, work, translated, into, several, languages, it, became, something, of, a, best, seller, in, its, day, and, played, an, important, role, in, the, spreading, of, the, ascetic, ideal, in, eastern, and, western, christianity, it, depicts, anthony, as, an, illiterate, yet, holy, man, who, continuously, engages, in, spiritual, exercises, in, the, egyptian, desert, and, struggles, against, demonic, powers, it, later, served, as, an, inspiration, to, christian, monastics, in, both, the, east, and, the, west, athanasius, works, on, asceticism, also, include, a, discourse, on, virginity, a, short, work, on, love, and, self, control, and, a, treatise, on, sickness, and, health, of, which, only, fragments, remain, there, are, several, other, works, ascribed, to, him, although, not, necessarily, generally, accepted, as, being, his, own, these, include, the, so, called, athanasian, creed, which, is, today, generally, seen, as, being, of, 5th, century, galician, origin, and, a, complete, expositions, on, the, psalms, during, the, arian, controversy, athanasius, was, the, main, defender, of, the, nicene, creed, and, the, term, homoousios, he, presented, himself, as, the, preserver, of, scriptural, orthodoxy, athanasius, was, a, one, hypostasis, theologian, meaning, that, father, son, and, holy, spirit, are, a, single, person, with, a, single, mind, following, origen, the, eusebians, taught, that, father, son, and, holy, spirit, are, three, distinct, hypostases, persons, in, contrast, consistent, with, the, idea, that, the, son, is, part, of, the, father, athanasius, believed, that, father, and, son, are, a, single, hypostasis, a, single, person, he, had, attended, the, council, of, serdica, among, the, western, bishops, in, 343, and, a, formal, letter, of, that, council, had, emphatically, opted, for, the, belief, in, one, and, only, one, hypostasis, as, orthodoxy, athanasius, certainly, accepted, this, doctrine, at, least, up, to, 359, even, though, he, tried, later, to, suppress, this, fact, hanson, p, 444, athanasius, insistence, on, a, single, hypostasis, in, god, is, further, illustrated, by, his, opposition, to, the, idea, that, the, logos, is, the, mediator, between, god, and, creation, athanasius, rejected, the, idea, of, the, pre, existent, logos, as, mediator, between, god, and, creation, since, he, did, not, recognize, the, logos, as, a, distinct, hypostasis, he, limited, christ, s, role, as, mediator, to, the, incarnation, therefore, athanasius, had, a, unitarian, theology, similar, to, the, sabellians, studer, s, account, here, follows, the, increasingly, prominent, scholarly, position, that, athanasius, theology, offers, a, strongly, unitarian, trinitarian, theology, whose, account, of, personal, differentiation, is, underdeveloped, ayres, p, 238, ayres, describes, both, athanasius, and, marcellus, sabellian, theologies, as, unitarian, based, on, his, understanding, of, the, prophecies, of, daniel, and, the, book, of, revelation, athanasius, described, jesus, second, coming, in, the, clouds, of, heaven, and, pleads, with, his, readers, to, be, ready, for, that, day, at, which, time, jesus, would, judge, the, earth, raise, the, dead, cast, out, the, wicked, and, establish, his, kingdom, athanasius, also, argued, that, the, date, of, jesus, earthly, sojourn, was, divinely, foretold, beyond, refutation, by, the, seventy, weeks, prophecy, of, daniel, 9, athanasius, was, originally, buried, in, alexandria, but, his, remains, were, later, transferred, to, the, chiesa, di, san, zaccaria, in, venice, italy, during, pope, shenouda, iii, s, visit, to, rome, 4, 10, may, 1973, pope, paul, vi, gave, the, coptic, patriarch, a, relic, of, athanasius, which, he, brought, back, to, egypt, on, 15, may, the, relic, is, currently, preserved, under, the, new, saint, mark, s, coptic, orthodox, cathedral, in, cairo, however, the, majority, of, athanasius, s, corpse, remains, in, the, venetian, church, all, major, christian, denominations, which, officially, recognize, saints, venerate, athanasius, western, christians, observe, his, feast, day, on, 2, may, the, anniversary, of, his, death, the, catholic, church, considers, athanasius, a, doctor, of, the, church, for, coptic, christians, his, feast, day, is, pashons, 7, now, circa, 15, may, eastern, orthodox, liturgical, calendars, remember, athanasius, on, 18, january, athanasius, is, honored, on, the, liturgical, calendars, of, the, church, of, england, and, the, episcopal, church, on, 2, may, gregory, of, nazianzus, 330, 390, also, a, doctor, of, the, church, said, when, i, praise, athanasius, virtue, itself, is, my, theme, for, i, name, every, virtue, as, often, as, i, mention, him, who, was, possessed, of, all, virtues, he, was, the, true, pillar, of, the, church, his, life, and, conduct, were, the, rule, of, bishops, and, his, doctrine, the, rule, of, the, orthodox, faith, historian, cornelius, clifford, says, in, his, account, athanasius, was, the, greatest, champion, of, catholic, belief, on, the, subject, of, the, incarnation, that, the, church, has, ever, known, and, in, his, lifetime, earned, the, characteristic, title, of, father, of, orthodoxy, by, which, he, has, been, distinguished, ever, since, clifford, also, says, his, career, almost, personifies, a, crisis, in, the, history, of, christianity, and, he, may, be, said, rather, to, have, shaped, the, events, in, which, he, took, part, than, to, have, been, shaped, by, them, st, john, henry, newman, describes, him, as, a, principal, instrument, after, the, apostles, by, which, the, sacred, truths, of, christianity, have, been, conveyed, and, secured, to, the, world, the, greater, majority, of, church, leaders, and, the, emperors, fell, into, support, for, arianism, so, much, so, that, jerome, 340, 420, wrote, of, the, period, the, whole, world, groaned, and, was, amazed, to, find, itself, arian, he, athanasius, even, suffered, an, unjust, excommunication, from, pope, liberius, who, was, exiled, and, leant, towards, compromise, until, he, was, allowed, back, to, the, see, of, rome, athanasius, stood, virtually, alone, against, the, world, it, was, the, custom, of, the, bishops, of, alexandria, to, circulate, a, letter, after, epiphany, each, year, confirming, the, date, of, easter, and, therefore, other, moveable, feasts, they, also, took, the, occasion, to, discuss, other, matters, athanasius, wrote, forty, five, festal, letters, athanasius, 39th, festal, letter, written, in, 367, is, widely, regarded, as, a, milestone, in, the, evolution, of, the, canon, of, new, testament, books, some, claim, that, athanasius, is, the, first, person, to, identify, the, same, 27, books, of, the, new, testament, that, are, in, use, today, up, until, then, various, similar, lists, of, works, to, be, read, in, churches, were, in, use, others, argue, that, origen, of, alexandria, was, the, first, to, list, the, twenty, seven, books, of, the, new, testament, in, his, homilies, on, joshua, only, there, is, a, textual, variant, as, to, whether, or, not, he, included, revelation, athanasius, includes, the, book, of, baruch, and, the, letter, of, jeremiah, and, places, the, book, of, esther, among, the, 7, books, not, in, the, canon, but, to, be, read, along, with, the, wisdom, of, solomon, book, of, sirach, book, of, judith, book, of, tobit, the, didache, and, the, shepherd, of, hermas, athanasius, list, is, similar, to, the, codex, vaticanus, in, the, vatican, library, the, establishment, of, the, canon, was, not, a, unilateral, decision, by, a, bishop, in, alexandria, but, the, result, of, a, process, of, careful, investigation, and, deliberation, as, documented, in, a, codex, of, the, greek, bible, and, twenty, seven, years, later, in, his, festal, letter, pope, damasus, i, the, bishop, of, rome, in, 382, promulgated, a, list, of, books, which, contained, a, new, testament, canon, identical, to, that, of, athanasius, a, synod, in, hippo, in, 393, repeated, athanasius, and, damasus, new, testament, list, without, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, and, the, council, of, carthage, 397, repeated, athanasius, and, damasus, complete, new, testament, list, scholars, debate, whether, athanasius, list, in, 367, formed, the, basis, for, later, lists, because, athanasius, canon, is, the, closest, canon, of, any, of, the, church, fathers, to, the, one, used, by, protestant, churches, today, many, protestants, point, to, athanasius, as, the, father, of, the, canon, christian, denominations, worldwide, revere, athanasius, as, a, saint, and, teacher, they, cite, his, defence, of, the, christology, described, in, the, first, chapter, of, the, gospel, of, st, john, and, his, significant, theological, works, c, s, lewis, calls, on, the, incarnation, of, the, word, of, god, a, masterpiece, as, evidence, of, his, righteousness, they, also, emphasize, his, close, relationship, with, anthony, the, great, the, ancient, monk, who, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, christian, monastic, movement, the, gospel, of, st, john, and, particularly, the, first, chapter, demonstrates, the, divinity, of, jesus, this, gospel, is, the, greatest, support, of, athanasius, stand, the, gospel, of, st, john, s, first, chapter, began, to, be, said, at, the, end, of, mass, we, believe, as, a, result, of, athanasius, and, his, life, s, stand, the, beginning, of, john, s, gospel, was, much, used, as, an, object, of, special, devotion, throughout, the, middle, ages, the, practice, of, saying, it, at, the, altar, grew, and, eventually, pope, pius, v, made, this, practice, universal, for, the, roman, rite, in, his, 1570, edition, of, the, missal, it, became, a, firm, custom, with, exceptions, in, using, another, gospel, in, use, from, 1920, cyril, of, alexandria, 370, 444, in, the, first, letter, says, athanasius, is, one, who, can, be, trusted, he, would, not, say, anything, that, is, not, in, accord, with, sacred, scripture, ep, 1, throughout, most, of, his, career, athanasius, had, many, detractors, classics, scholar, timothy, barnes, recounts, ancient, allegations, against, athanasius, from, defiling, an, altar, to, selling, church, grain, that, had, been, meant, to, feed, the, poor, for, his, own, personal, gain, and, even, violence, and, murder, to, suppress, dissent, according, to, sir, isaac, newton, athanasius, lied, about, the, death, of, arius, feigned, other, men, s, letters, and, denied, his, own, murdered, the, bishop, arsenius, broke, a, communion, cup, overthrew, an, altar, was, made, bishop, by, violence, and, sedition, against, the, canons, of, his, own, church, and, was, seditious, and, immoral, athanasius, used, arian, to, describe, both, followers, of, arius, and, as, a, derogatory, polemical, term, for, christians, who, disagreed, with, his, formulation, of, the, trinity, athanasius, called, many, of, his, opponents, arian, except, for, meletius, scholars, now, believe, that, the, arian, party, was, not, monolithic, but, held, drastically, different, theological, views, that, spanned, the, early, christian, theological, spectrum, they, supported, the, tenets, of, origenist, thought, and, subordinationist, theology, but, had, little, else, in, common, moreover, many, labelled, arian, did, not, consider, themselves, followers, of, arius, in, addition, non, homoousian, bishops, disagreed, with, being, labeled, as, followers, of, arius, since, arius, was, merely, a, presbyter, while, they, were, fully, ordained, bishops, the, old, allegations, continue, to, be, made, against, athanasius, however, many, centuries, later, for, example, richard, e, rubenstein, suggests, that, athanasius, ascended, to, the, rank, of, bishop, in, alexandria, under, questionable, circumstances, because, some, questioned, whether, he, had, reached, the, minimum, age, of, 30, years, and, further, that, athanasius, employed, force, when, it, suited, his, cause, or, personal, interests, thus, he, argues, that, a, small, number, of, bishops, who, supported, athanasius, held, a, private, consecration, to, make, him, bishop
