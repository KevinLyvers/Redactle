s, european, tour, of, 1892, was, a, large, formal, banquet, at, the, university, of, berlin, mark, twain, was, an, honoured, guest, seated, at, the, head, table, with, some, twenty, particularly, eminent, professors, and, it, was, from, this, vantage, point, that, he, witnessed, the, following, incident, in, twain, s, own, words, when, apparently, the, last, eminent, guest, had, long, ago, taken, his, place, again, those, three, bugle, blasts, rang, out, and, once, more, the, swords, leaped, from, their, scabbards, who, might, this, late, comer, be, nobody, was, interested, to, inquire, still, indolent, eyes, were, turned, toward, the, distant, entrance, and, we, saw, the, silken, gleam, and, the, lifted, sword, of, a, guard, of, honor, plowing, through, the, remote, crowds, then, we, saw, that, end, of, the, house, rising, to, its, feet, saw, it, rise, abreast, the, advancing, guard, all, along, like, a, wave, this, supreme, honor, had, been, offered, to, no, one, before, there, was, an, excited, whisper, at, our, table, mommsen, and, the, whole, house, rose, rose, and, shouted, and, stamped, and, clapped, and, banged, the, beer, mugs, just, simply, a, storm, then, the, little, man, with, his, long, hair, and, emersonian, face, edged, his, way, past, us, and, took, his, seat, i, could, have, touched, him, with, my, hand, mommsen, think, of, it, i, would, have, walked, a, great, many, miles, to, get, a, sight, of, him, and, here, he, was, without, trouble, or, tramp, or, cost, of, any, kind, here, he, was, clothed, in, a, titanic, deceptive, modesty, which, made, him, look, like, other, men, mommsen, published, over, 1, 500, works, and, effectively, established, a, new, framework, for, the, systematic, study, of, roman, history, he, pioneered, epigraphy, the, study, of, inscriptions, in, material, artefacts, although, the, unfinished, history, of, rome, written, early, in, his, career, has, long, been, widely, considered, as, his, main, work, the, work, most, relevant, today, is, perhaps, the, corpus, inscriptionum, latinarum, a, collection, of, roman, inscriptions, he, contributed, to, the, berlin, academy, a, bibliography, of, over, 1, 000, of, his, works, is, given, by, zangemeister, in, mommsen, als, schriftsteller, 1887, continued, by, jacobs, 1905
