representatives, of, the, early, netherlandish, painting, school, his, work, generally, oil, on, oak, wood, mainly, contains, fantastic, illustrations, of, religious, concepts, and, narratives, within, his, lifetime, his, work, was, collected, in, the, netherlands, austria, and, spain, and, widely, copied, especially, his, macabre, and, nightmarish, depictions, of, hell, little, is, known, of, bosch, s, life, though, there, are, some, records, he, spent, most, of, it, in, the, town, of, s, hertogenbosch, where, he, was, born, in, his, grandfather, s, house, the, roots, of, his, forefathers, are, in, nijmegen, and, aachen, which, is, visible, in, his, surname, van, aken, his, pessimistic, fantastical, style, cast, a, wide, influence, on, northern, art, of, the, 16th, century, with, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, being, his, best, known, follower, today, bosch, is, seen, as, a, highly, individualistic, painter, with, deep, insight, into, humanity, s, desires, and, deepest, fears, attribution, has, been, especially, difficult, today, only, about, 25, paintings, are, confidently, given, to, his, hand, along, with, eight, drawings, about, another, half, dozen, paintings, are, confidently, attributed, to, his, workshop, his, most, acclaimed, works, consist, of, a, few, triptych, altarpieces, including, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, hieronymus, bosch, s, first, name, was, originally, jheronimus, or, joen, respectively, the, latin, and, middle, dutch, form, of, the, name, jerome, and, he, signed, a, number, of, his, paintings, as, jheronimus, bosch, his, surname, bosch, derives, from, his, birthplace, s, hertogenbosch, duke, s, forest, which, is, commonly, called, den, bosch, the, forest, little, is, known, of, bosch, s, life, or, training, he, left, behind, no, letters, or, diaries, and, what, has, been, identified, has, been, taken, from, brief, references, to, him, in, the, municipal, records, of, s, hertogenbosch, and, in, the, account, books, of, the, local, order, of, the, illustrious, brotherhood, of, our, blessed, lady, nothing, is, known, of, his, personality, or, his, thoughts, on, the, meaning, of, his, art, bosch, s, date, of, birth, has, not, been, determined, with, certainty, it, is, estimated, at, c, 1450, on, the, basis, of, a, hand, drawn, portrait, which, may, be, a, self, portrait, made, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1516, the, drawing, shows, the, artist, at, an, advanced, age, probably, in, his, late, sixties, bosch, lived, all, his, life, in, and, near, s, hertogenbosch, in, the, duchy, of, brabant, his, grandfather, jan, van, aken, died, 1454, was, a, painter, and, is, first, mentioned, in, the, records, in, 1430, jan, had, five, sons, four, of, whom, were, also, painters, bosch, s, father, anthonius, van, aken, died, c, 1478, acted, as, artistic, adviser, to, the, illustrious, brotherhood, of, our, blessed, lady, it, is, generally, assumed, that, either, bosch, s, father, or, one, of, his, uncles, taught, the, artist, to, paint, but, none, of, their, works, survive, bosch, first, appears, in, the, municipal, record, on, 5, april, 1474, when, he, is, named, along, with, two, brothers, and, a, sister, s, hertogenbosch, was, a, flourishing, city, in, 15th, century, brabant, in, the, south, of, the, present, day, netherlands, at, the, time, part, of, the, burgundian, netherlands, and, during, its, lifetime, passing, through, marriage, to, the, habsburgs, in, 1463, four, thousand, houses, in, the, town, were, destroyed, by, a, catastrophic, fire, which, the, then, approximately, thirteen, year, old, bosch, presumably, witnessed, he, became, a, popular, painter, in, his, lifetime, and, often, received, commissions, from, abroad, in, 1486, 7, he, joined, the, highly, respected, brotherhood, of, our, lady, a, devotional, confraternity, of, some, forty, influential, citizens, of, s, hertogenbosch, and, seven, thousand, outer, members, from, around, europe, sometime, between, 1479, and, 1481, bosch, married, aleid, goyaerts, van, den, meervenne, who, was, a, few, years, his, senior, the, couple, moved, to, the, nearby, town, of, oirschot, where, aleid, goyaerts, van, den, meervenne, had, inherited, a, house, and, land, from, her, wealthy, family, an, entry, in, the, accounts, of, the, brotherhood, of, our, lady, records, bosch, s, death, in, 1516, a, funeral, mass, served, in, his, memory, was, held, in, the, church, of, saint, john, on, 9, august, of, that, year, bosch, produced, at, least, sixteen, triptychs, of, them, eight, survive, fully, intact, with, another, five, surviving, in, fragments, bosch, s, works, are, generally, organised, into, three, periods, of, his, life, dealing, with, the, early, works, c, 1470, 1485, the, middle, period, c, 1485, 1500, and, the, late, period, c, 1500, until, his, death, according, to, stefan, fischer, thirteen, of, bosch, s, surviving, paintings, were, completed, in, the, late, period, with, seven, attributed, to, his, middle, period, bosch, s, early, period, is, studied, in, terms, of, his, workshop, activity, and, possibly, some, of, his, drawings, indeed, he, taught, pupils, in, the, workshop, who, were, influenced, by, him, the, recent, dendrochronological, investigation, of, the, oak, panels, by, the, scientists, at, the, bosch, research, and, conservation, project, led, to, a, more, precise, dating, of, the, majority, of, bosch, s, paintings, bosch, sometimes, painted, in, a, comparatively, sketchy, manner, contrasting, with, the, traditional, early, netherlandish, style, of, painting, in, which, the, smooth, surface, achieved, by, the, application, of, multiple, transparent, glazes, conceals, the, brushwork, bosch, s, paintings, with, their, rough, surfaces, so, called, impasto, painting, differed, from, the, tradition, of, the, great, netherlandish, painters, of, the, end, of, the, 15th, and, beginning, of, the, 16th, centuries, who, wished, to, hide, the, work, done, and, so, suggest, their, paintings, as, more, nearly, divine, creations, bosch, did, not, date, his, paintings, but, unusual, for, the, time, he, seems, to, have, signed, several, of, them, although, some, signatures, purporting, to, be, his, are, certainly, not, about, twenty, five, paintings, remain, today, that, can, be, attributed, to, him, in, the, late, 16th, century, philip, ii, of, spain, acquired, many, of, bosch, s, paintings, as, a, result, the, prado, museum, in, madrid, now, owns, the, adoration, of, the, magi, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, the, tabletop, painting, of, the, seven, deadly, sins, and, the, four, last, things, and, the, haywain, triptych, bosch, painted, his, works, mostly, on, oak, panels, using, oil, as, a, medium, bosch, s, palette, was, rather, limited, and, contained, the, usual, pigments, of, his, time, he, mostly, used, azurite, for, blue, skies, and, distant, landscapes, green, copper, based, glazes, and, paints, consisting, of, malachite, or, verdigris, for, foliage, and, foreground, landscapes, and, lead, tin, yellow, ochres, and, red, lake, carmine, or, madder, lake, for, his, figures, one, of, his, most, famous, triptychs, is, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, c, 1495, 1505, whose, outer, panels, are, intended, to, bracket, the, main, central, panel, between, the, garden, of, eden, depicted, on, the, left, panel, and, the, last, judgment, depicted, on, the, right, panel, it, is, attributed, by, fischer, as, a, transition, painting, rendered, by, bosch, from, between, his, middle, period, and, his, late, period, in, the, left, hand, panel, god, presents, eve, to, adam, innovatively, god, is, given, a, youthful, appearance, the, figures, are, set, in, a, landscape, populated, by, exotic, animals, and, unusual, semi, organic, hut, shaped, forms, the, central, panel, is, a, broad, panorama, teeming, with, nude, figures, engaged, in, innocent, self, absorbed, joy, as, well, as, fantastical, compound, animals, oversized, fruit, and, hybrid, stone, formations, the, right, panel, presents, a, hellscape, a, world, in, which, humankind, has, succumbed, to, the, temptations, of, evil, and, is, reaping, eternal, damnation, set, at, night, the, panel, features, cold, colours, tortured, figures, and, frozen, waterways, the, nakedness, of, the, human, figures, has, lost, any, eroticism, suggested, in, the, central, panel, as, large, explosions, in, the, background, throw, light, through, the, city, gate, and, spill, onto, the, water, in, the, panel, s, midground, triptych, of, the, temptation, of, st, anthony, is, one, of, the, most, famous, bosch, s, works, along, with, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, it, shows, saint, anthony, being, tempted, or, assailed, in, the, desert, by, demons, whose, temptations, he, resisted, the, temptation, of, st, anthony, or, trial, is, the, more, common, name, of, the, subject, but, strictly, there, are, at, least, two, different, episodes, deriving, from, athanasius, s, life, of, st, anthony, and, later, versions, of, the, life, that, may, be, represented, though, all, usually, have, this, name, the, most, common, is, the, temptation, by, seductive, women, and, other, demonic, forms, but, the, martin, schongauer, composition, copied, by, michelangelo, probably, shows, a, later, episode, where, st, anthony, normally, flown, about, the, desert, supported, by, angels, was, ambushed, and, attacked, in, mid, air, by, devils, anasthasius, describes, another, episode, where, the, saint, was, attacked, on, the, ground, with, copied, content, from, triptych, of, the, temptation, of, st, anthony, see, that, page, for, attribution, in, the, 20th, century, when, changing, artistic, tastes, made, artists, like, bosch, more, palatable, to, the, european, imagination, it, was, sometimes, argued, that, bosch, s, art, was, inspired, by, heretical, points, of, view, e, g, the, ideas, of, the, cathars, and, or, putative, adamites, or, brethren, of, the, free, spirit, as, well, as, by, obscure, hermetic, practices, again, since, erasmus, had, been, educated, at, one, of, the, houses, of, the, brethren, of, the, common, life, in, s, hertogenbosch, and, the, town, was, religiously, progressive, some, writers, have, found, it, unsurprising, that, strong, parallels, exist, between, the, caustic, writing, of, erasmus, and, the, often, bold, painting, of, bosch, others, following, a, strain, of, bosch, interpretation, datable, already, to, the, 16th, century, continued, to, think, his, work, was, created, merely, to, titillate, and, amuse, much, like, the, grotteschi, of, the, italian, renaissance, while, the, art, of, the, older, masters, was, based, in, the, physical, world, of, everyday, experience, bosch, confronts, his, viewer, with, in, the, words, of, the, art, historian, walter, gibson, a, world, of, dreams, nightmares, in, which, forms, seem, to, flicker, and, change, before, our, eyes, in, one, of, the, first, known, accounts, of, bosch, s, paintings, in, 1560, the, spaniard, felipe, de, guevara, wrote, that, bosch, was, regarded, merely, as, the, inventor, of, monsters, and, chimeras, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, artist, biographer, karel, van, mander, described, bosch, s, work, as, comprising, wondrous, and, strange, fantasies, however, he, concluded, that, the, paintings, are, often, less, pleasant, than, gruesome, to, look, at, in, recent, decades, scholars, have, come, to, view, bosch, s, vision, as, less, fantastic, and, accepted, that, his, art, reflects, the, orthodox, religious, belief, systems, of, his, age, his, depictions, of, sinful, humanity, and, his, conceptions, of, heaven, and, hell, are, now, seen, as, consistent, with, those, of, late, medieval, didactic, literature, and, sermons, most, writers, attach, a, more, profound, significance, to, his, paintings, than, had, previously, been, supposed, and, attempt, to, interpret, them, in, terms, of, a, late, medieval, morality, it, is, generally, accepted, that, bosch, s, art, was, created, to, teach, specific, moral, and, spiritual, truths, in, the, manner, of, other, northern, renaissance, figures, such, as, the, poet, robert, henryson, and, that, the, images, rendered, have, precise, and, premeditated, significance, according, to, dirk, bax, bosch, s, paintings, often, represent, visual, translations, of, verbal, metaphors, and, puns, drawn, from, both, biblical, and, folkloric, sources, latterly, art, historians, have, added, a, further, dimension, to, the, subject, of, ambiguity, in, bosch, s, work, emphasising, ironic, tendencies, for, example, in, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, both, in, the, central, panel, delights, and, the, right, panel, hell, they, theorise, that, the, irony, offers, the, option, of, detachment, both, from, the, real, world, and, from, the, painted, fantasy, world, thus, appealing, to, both, conservative, and, progressive, viewers, according, to, joseph, koerner, some, of, the, cryptic, qualities, of, the, artist, s, work, are, due, to, his, special, focus, on, social, political, and, spiritual, enemies, whose, symbolism, is, by, nature, disguised, because, it, is, intended, to, conceal, the, artist, from, criticism, and, harm, a, 2012, study, on, bosch, s, paintings, alleges, that, they, actually, conceal, a, strong, nationalist, consciousness, censuring, the, foreign, imperial, government, of, the, burgundian, netherlands, especially, maximilian, habsburg, by, systematically, superimposing, images, and, concepts, the, study, asserts, that, bosch, also, made, his, expiatory, self, punishment, for, he, was, accepting, well, paid, commissions, from, the, habsburgs, and, their, deputies, and, therefore, betraying, the, memory, of, charles, the, bold, the, exact, number, of, bosch, s, surviving, works, has, been, a, subject, of, considerable, debate, his, signature, can, be, seen, on, only, seven, of, his, surviving, paintings, and, there, is, uncertainty, whether, all, the, paintings, once, ascribed, to, him, were, actually, from, his, hand, it, is, known, that, from, the, early, 16th, century, onwards, numerous, copies, and, variations, of, his, paintings, began, to, circulate, in, addition, his, style, was, highly, influential, and, was, widely, imitated, by, his, numerous, followers, over, the, years, scholars, have, attributed, to, him, fewer, and, fewer, of, the, works, once, thought, to, be, his, this, is, partly, a, result, of, technological, advances, such, as, infrared, reflectography, which, enable, researchers, to, examine, a, painting, s, underdrawing, art, historians, of, the, early, and, mid, 20th, century, such, as, tolnay, and, baldass, identified, between, thirty, and, fifty, paintings, that, they, believed, to, be, by, bosch, s, hand, a, later, monograph, by, gerd, unverfehrt, 1980, attributed, twenty, five, paintings, and, 14, drawings, to, him, in, early, 2016, the, temptation, of, st, anthony, a, small, panel, in, the, nelson, atkins, museum, of, art, in, kansas, city, missouri, long, attributed, to, the, workshop, of, hieronymus, bosch, was, credited, to, the, painter, himself, after, intensive, forensic, study, by, the, bosch, research, and, conservation, project, the, brcp, has, also, questioned, whether, two, well, known, paintings, traditionally, accepted, to, be, by, bosch, the, seven, deadly, sins, in, the, prado, and, christ, carrying, the, cross, in, the, museum, of, fine, arts, ghent, should, instead, be, credited, to, the, artist, s, workshop, rather, than, to, the, painter, s, own, hand
