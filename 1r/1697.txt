george, carver, george, liked, mariah, watkins, and, her, words, you, must, learn, all, you, can, then, go, back, out, into, the, world, and, give, your, learning, back, to, the, people, made, a, great, impression, on, him, at, age, 13, because, he, wanted, to, attend, the, academy, there, he, moved, to, the, home, of, another, foster, family, in, fort, scott, kansas, after, witnessing, the,

random, and, began, requesting, letters, to, him, be, addressed, to, george, w, carver, someone, once, asked, if, the, w, stood, for, washington, and, carver, grinned, and, said, why, not, however, he, never, used, washington, as, his, middle, name, and, signed, his, name, as, either, george, w, carver, or, simply, george, carver, carver, applied, to, several, colleges, before, being, accepted, at, highland, university, in, highland, kansas, when, he, arrived, they, refused, to, let, him, attend, because, of, his, race, in, august, 1886, carver, traveled, by, wagon, with, j, f, beeler, from,

for, painting, flowers, and, plants, she, encouraged, him, to, study, botany, at, iowa, state, agricultural, college, now, iowa, state, university, in, ames, when, he, began, there, in, 1891, he, was, the, first, black, student, at, iowa, state, carver, s, bachelor, s, thesis, for, a, degree, in, agriculture, was, plants, as, modified, by, man, dated, 1894, iowa, state, university, professors,

years, his, work, at, the, experiment, station, in, plant, pathology, and, mycology, first, gained, him, national, recognition, and, respect, as, a, botanist, carver, received, his, master, of, science, degree, in, 1896, carver, taught, as, the, first, african, american, faculty, member, at, iowa, state, despite, occasionally, being, addressed, as, doctor, carver, never, received, an, official, doctorate, and, in, a, personal, communication, with, pammel, he, noted, that, it, was, a, misnomer, given, to, him, by, others, due, to, his, abilities, and, their, assumptions, about, his, education, though, he, did, not, have, an, earned, doctorate, both, simpson, college, and, selma, university, awarded, him, honorary, doctorates, of, science, in, his, lifetime, in, addition, iowa, state, awarded, him, a, posthumous, doctor, of, humane, letters, degree, in, 1994, in, 1896, booker, t, washington, the, first, principal, and, president, of, the, tuskegee, institute, now, tuskegee, university, invited, carver, to, head, its, agriculture, department, carver, taught, there, for, 47, years, developing, the, department, into, a, strong, research, center, and, working, with, two, additional, college, presidents, during, his, tenure, he, taught, methods, of, crop, rotation, introduced, several, alternative, cash, crops, for, farmers, that, would, also, improve, the, soil, of, areas, heavily, cultivated, in, cotton, initiated, research, into, crop, products, chemurgy, and, taught, generations, of, black, students, farming, techniques, for, self, sufficiency, carver, designed, a, mobile, classroom, to, take, education, out, to, farmers, he, called, it, a, jesup, wagon, after, the, new, york, financier, and, philanthropist, morris, ketchum, jesup, who, provided, funding, to, support, the, program, to, recruit, carver, to, tuskegee, washington, gave, him, an, above, average, salary, and, two, rooms, for, his, personal, use, although, both, concessions, were, resented, by, some, other, faculty, because, he, had, earned, a, master, s, in, a, scientific, field, from, a, white, institution, some, faculty, perceived, him, as, arrogant, unmarried, faculty, members, normally, had, to, share, rooms, with, two, to, a, room, in, the, spartan, early, days, of, the, institute, one, of, carver, s, duties, was, to, administer, the, agricultural, experiment, station, farms, he, had, to, manage, the, production, and, sale, of, farm, products, to, generate, revenue, for, the, institute, he, soon, proved, to, be, a, poor, administrator, and, clashed, with, other, faculty, members, especially, george, ruffin, bridgeforth, in, 1900, carver, complained, that, the, physical, work, and, the, letter, writing, required, were, too, much, in, 1904, an, institute, committee, reported, that, carver, s, reports, on, yields, from, the, poultry, yard, were, exaggerated, and, washington, confronted, carver, about, the, issue, carver, replied, in, writing, now, to, be, branded, as, a, liar, and, party, to, such, hellish, deception, it, is, more, than, i, can, bear, and, if, your, committee, feel, that, i, have, willfully, lied, or, party, to, such, lies, as, were, told, my, resignation, is, at, your, disposal, during, washington, s, last, five, years, at, tuskegee, carver, submitted, or, threatened, his, resignation, several, times, when, the, administration, reorganized, the, agriculture, programs, when, he, disliked, a, teaching, assignment, to, manage, an, experiment, station, elsewhere, and, when, he, did, not, get, summer, teaching, assignments, in, 1913, 14, in, each, case, washington, smoothed, things, over, carver, started, his, academic, career, as, a, researcher, and, teacher, in, 1911, washington, wrote, a, letter, to, him, complaining, that, carver, had, not, followed, orders, to, plant, particular, crops, at, the, experiment, station, this, revealed, washington, s, micro, management, of, carver, s, department, which, he, had, headed, for, more, than, 10, years, by, then, washington, at, the, same, time, refused, carver, s, requests, for, a, new, laboratory, research, supplies, for, his, exclusive, use, and, respite, from, teaching, classes, washington, praised, carver, s, abilities, in, teaching, and, original, research, but, said, this, about, his, administrative, skills, when, it, comes, to, the, organization, of, classes, the, ability, required, to, secure, a, properly, organized, and, large, school, or, section, of, a, school, you, are, wanting, in, ability, when, it, comes, to, the, matter, of, practical, farm, managing, which, will, secure, definite, practical, financial, results, you, are, wanting, again, in, ability, in, 1911, carver, complained, that, his, laboratory, had, not, received, the, equipment, which, washington, had, promised, 11, months, before, he, also, complained, about, institute, committee, meetings, washington, praised, carver, in, his, 1911, memoir, my, larger, education, being, chapters, from, my, experience, washington, called, carver, one, of, the, most, thoroughly, scientific, men, of, the, negro, race, with, whom, i, am, acquainted, after, washington, died, in, 1915, his, successor, made, fewer, demands, on, carver, for, administrative, tasks, from, 1915, to, 1923, carver, concentrated, on, researching, and, experimenting, with, new, uses, for, peanuts, sweet, potatoes, soybeans, pecans, and, other, crops, as, well, as, having, his, assistants, research, and, compile, existing, uses, this, work, and, especially, his, speaking, to, a, national, conference, of, the, peanut, growers, association, in, 1920, and, in, testimony, before, congress, in, 1921, to, support, passage, of, a, tariff, on, imported, peanuts, brought, him, wide, publicity, and, increasing, renown, in, these, years, he, became, one, of, the, most, well, known, african, americans, of, his, time, carver, developed, techniques, to, improve, soils, depleted, by, repeated, plantings, of, cotton, together, with, other, agricultural, experts, he, urged, farmers, to, restore, nitrogen, to, their, soils, by, practicing, systematic, crop, rotation, alternating, cotton, crops, with, plantings, of, sweet, potatoes, or, legumes, such, as, peanuts, soybeans, and, cowpeas, these, crops, both, restored, nitrogen, to, the, soil, and, were, good, for, human, consumption, following, the, crop, rotation, practice, resulted, in, improved, cotton, yields, and, gave, farmers, alternative, cash, crops, to, train, farmers, to, successfully, rotate, and, cultivate, the, new, crops, carver, developed, an, agricultural, extension, program, for, alabama, that, was, similar, to, the, one, at, iowa, state, to, encourage, better, nutrition, in, the, south, he, widely, distributed, recipes, using, the, alternative, crops, he, founded, an, industrial, research, laboratory, where, he, and, assistants, worked, to, popularize, the, new, crops, by, developing, hundreds, of, applications, for, them, they, did, original, research, as, well, as, promoting, applications, and, recipes, which, they, collected, from, others, carver, distributed, his, information, as, agricultural, bulletins, carver, s, work, was, known, by, officials, in, the, national, capital, before, he, became, a, public, figure, president, theodore, roosevelt, publicly, admired, his, work, former, professors, of, carver, s, from, iowa, state, university, were, appointed, to, positions, as, secretary, of, agriculture, james, wilson, a, former, dean, and, professor, of, carver, s, served, from, 1897, to, 1913, henry, cantwell, wallace, served, from, 1921, to, 1924, he, knew, carver, personally, because, his, son, henry, a, wallace, and, the, researcher, were, friends, the, younger, wallace, served, as, u, s, secretary, of, agriculture, from, 1933, to, 1940, and, as, franklin, delano, roosevelt, s, vice, president, from, 1941, to, 1945, the, american, industrialist, farmer, and, inventor, william, c, edenborn, of, winn, parish, louisiana, grew, peanuts, on, his, demonstration, farm, he, consulted, with, carver, in, 1916, carver, was, made, a, member, of, the, royal, society, of, arts, in, england, one, of, only, a, handful, of, americans, at, that, time, to, receive, this, honor, carver, s, promotion, of, peanuts, gained, him, the, most, notice, by, 1920, the, u, s, peanut, farmers, were, being, undercut, by, low, prices, on, imported, peanuts, from, the, republic, of, china, in, 1921, peanut, farmers, and, industry, representatives, planned, to, appear, at, congressional, hearings, to, ask, for, a, tariff, based, on, the, quality, of, carver, s, presentation, at, their, convention, they, asked, the, african, american, professor, to, testify, on, the, tariff, issue, before, the, ways, and, means, committee, of, the, united, states, house, of, representatives, due, to, segregation, it, was, highly, unusual, for, an, african, american, to, appear, as, an, expert, witness, but, carver, appeared, and, unpacked, numerous, exhibits, and, samples, to, make, his, case, for, greater, food, and, industrial, uses, for, the, peanut, southern, congressmen, mocked, him, but, as, he, talked, about, the, importance, of, the, peanut, and, its, uses, for, american, agriculture, and, manufacturing, committee, members, repeatedly, extended, the, time, for, his, testimony, the, fordney, mccumber, tariff, was, enacted, in, 1922, and, included, a, duty, on, imported, peanuts, carver, s, testimony, including, samples, of, peanut, milk, peanut, flour, industrial, dyes, made, from, peanuts, and, other, peanut, based, products, made, him, widely, known, as, a, public, figure, during, the, last, two, decades, of, his, life, carver, seemed, to, enjoy, his, celebrity, status, he, was, often, on, the, road, promoting, tuskegee, university, peanuts, sweet, potatoes, and, racial, harmony, although, he, only, published, six, agricultural, bulletins, after, 1922, he, published, articles, in, peanut, industry, journals, and, wrote, a, syndicated, newspaper, column, professor, carver, s, advice, business, leaders, came, to, seek, his, help, and, he, often, responded, with, free, advice, three, american, presidents, theodore, roosevelt, calvin, coolidge, and, franklin, roosevelt, met, with, him, and, the, crown, prince, of, sweden, studied, with, him, for, three, weeks, from, 1923, to, 1933, carver, toured, white, southern, colleges, for, the, commission, on, interracial, cooperation, with, his, increasing, notability, carver, became, the, subject, of, biographies, and, articles, raleigh, h, merritt, contacted, him, for, his, biography, published, in, 1929, merritt, wrote, at, present, not, a, great, deal, has, been, done, to, utilize, dr, carver, s, discoveries, commercially, he, says, that, he, is, merely, scratching, the, surface, of, scientific, investigations, of, the, possibilities, of, the, peanut, and, other, southern, products, in, 1932, the, writer, james, saxon, childers, wrote, that, carver, and, his, peanut, products, were, almost, solely, responsible, for, the, rise, in, u, s, peanut, production, after, the, boll, weevil, devastated, the, american, cotton, crop, beginning, about, 1892, his, article, a, boy, who, was, traded, for, a, horse, 1932, in, the, american, magazine, and, its, 1937, reprint, in, reader, s, digest, contributed, to, this, myth, about, carver, s, influence, other, popular, media, tended, to, exaggerate, carver, s, impact, on, the, peanut, industry, from, 1933, to, 1935, carver, worked, to, develop, peanut, oil, massages, to, treat, infantile, paralysis, polio, ultimately, researchers, found, that, the, massages, not, the, peanut, oil, provided, the, benefits, of, maintaining, some, mobility, to, paralyzed, limbs, from, 1935, to, 1937, carver, participated, in, the, usda, disease, survey, carver, had, specialized, in, plant, diseases, and, mycology, for, his, master, s, degree, in, 1937, carver, attended, two, chemurgy, conferences, an, emerging, field, in, the, 1930s, during, the, great, depression, and, the, dust, bowl, concerned, with, developing, new, products, from, crops, he, was, invited, by, henry, ford, to, speak, at, the, conference, held, in, dearborn, michigan, and, they, developed, a, friendship, that, year, carver, s, health, declined, and, ford, later, installed, an, elevator, at, the, tuskegee, dormitory, where, carver, lived, so, that, the, elderly, man, would, not, have, to, climb, stairs, carver, had, been, frugal, in, his, life, and, in, his, seventies, he, established, a, legacy, by, creating, a, museum, of, his, work, as, well, as, the, george, washington, carver, foundation, at, tuskegee, in, 1938, to, continue, agricultural, research, he, donated, nearly, us, 60, 000, equivalent, to, 1, 298, 723, in, 2023, in, his, savings, to, create, the, foundation, carver, headed, the, modern, organic, movement, in, the, southern, agricultural, system, carver, s, background, for, his, interest, in, organic, farming, sprouted, from, his, father, being, killed, during, the, civil, war, and, when, his, mother, was, kidnapped, by, confederate, slave, raiders, now, an, orphan, carver, found, comfort, in, botany, when, he, was, just, 11, years, old, in, kansas, carver, learned, about, herbal, medicine, natural, pesticides, and, natural, fertilizers, that, yielded, plentiful, crops, from, his, caretaker, when, crops, and, house, plants, were, dying, he, would, use, his, knowledge, and, go, and, nurse, them, back, to, health, as, a, teenager, he, was, termed, the, plant, doctor, when, his, study, about, infection, in, soybean, reached, booker, t, washington, he, invited, him, to, come, and, teach, at, the, tuskegee, agricultural, school, although, the, emancipation, allowed, black, families, 40, acres, and, a, mule, president, johnson, revoked, this, and, gave, the, land, to, white, plantation, owners, instead, this, prompted, black, farmers, to, exchange, what, was, once, their, land, and, in, turn, a, small, part, of, the, land, s, harvest, this, led, to, sharecropping, carver, soon, realized, that, farmers, were, not, obtaining, enough, food, to, survive, and, how, the, industrialization, of, cotton, had, contaminated, the, soil, carver, wanted, to, find, a, way, to, organically, transform, alabama, s, failing, soil, he, found, that, alternating, nitrogen, rich, crops, would, let, the, soil, get, back, to, its, natural, state, keeping, crops, like, sweet, potatoes, peanuts, and, cowpeas, would, produce, more, food, surplus, and, different, types, of, food, for, farmers, carver, worked, to, pioneer, organic, fertilizers, like, swamp, muck, and, compost, for, the, farmers, to, use, these, fertilizers, were, more, sustainable, to, the, planet, and, helped, farmers, to, spend, less, money, on, fertilizers, since, they, were, recycling, products, carver, pushed, for, woodland, preservation, to, help, improve, the, quality, of, the, topsoil, he, urged, farmers, to, feed, their, hogs, acorns, the, acorns, contained, natural, pesticides, and, feeding, them, acorns, was, cheaper, for, the, farms, too, carver, s, efforts, towards, the, holistic, and, organic, approach, are, still, in, practice, today, in, his, research, carver, discovered, permaculture, permaculture, could, be, used, to, produce, carbon, from, the, atmosphere, produce, a, higher, quantity, of, crops, and, let, crops, flourish, despite, global, warming, carver, never, married, at, age, 40, he, began, a, courtship, with, sarah, l, hunt, an, elementary, school, teacher, and, the, sister, in, law, of, warren, logan, treasurer, of, tuskegee, institute, this, lasted, three, years, until, she, took, a, teaching, job, in, california, in, her, 2015, biography, christina, vella, reviews, his, relationships, and, suggests, that, carver, was, bisexual, and, constrained, by, mores, of, his, historic, period, when, he, was, 70, carver, established, a, friendship, and, research, partnership, with, the, scientist, austin, w, curtis, jr, this, young, black, man, a, graduate, of, cornell, university, had, some, teaching, experience, before, coming, to, tuskegee, carver, bequeathed, to, curtis, his, royalties, from, an, authorized, 1943, biography, by, rackham, holt, after, carver, died, in, 1943, curtis, was, fired, from, tuskegee, institute, he, left, alabama, and, resettled, in, detroit, there, he, manufactured, and, sold, peanut, based, personal, care, products, upon, returning, home, one, day, carver, suffered, a, bad, fall, down, a, flight, of, stairs, he, was, found, unconscious, by, a, maid, who, took, him, to, a, hospital, carver, died, january, 5, 1943, at, the, age, of, 78, or, 79, from, complications, anemia, resulting, from, this, fall, his, death, came, when, he, was, sitting, up, in, bed, while, painting, a, christmas, card, which, said, peace, on, earth, and, goodwill, to, all, men, carver, biographer, prema, ramakrishnan, said, of, him, that, his, death, was, characteristic, of, him, and, his, entire, life, s, work, he, was, buried, next, to, booker, t, washington, at, tuskegee, university, due, to, his, frugality, carver, s, life, savings, totaled, 60, 000, all, of, which, he, donated, in, his, last, years, and, at, his, death, to, the, carver, museum, and, to, the, george, washington, carver, foundation, on, his, grave, was, written, he, could, have, added, fortune, to, fame, but, caring, for, neither, he, found, happiness, and, honor, in, being, helpful, to, the, world, carver, believed, he, could, have, faith, both, in, god, and, science, and, integrated, them, into, his, life, he, testified, on, many, occasions, that, his, faith, in, jesus, was, the, only, mechanism, by, which, he, could, effectively, pursue, and, perform, the, art, of, science, carver, became, a, christian, when, he, was, still, a, young, boy, as, he, wrote, in, connection, to, his, conversion, in, 1931, i, was, just, a, mere, boy, when, converted, hardly, ten, years, old, there, isn, t, much, of, a, story, to, it, god, just, came, into, my, heart, one, afternoon, while, i, was, alone, in, the, loft, of, our, big, barn, while, i, was, shelling, corn, to, carry, to, the, mill, to, be, ground, into, meal, a, dear,
