the, time, writing, for, solo, piano, voice, and, piano, chamber, groups, orchestra, choir, and, the, opera, his, works, typify, the, spirit, of, the, romantic, era, in, german, music, schumann, was, born, in, zwickau, saxony, to, an, affluent, middle, class, family, with, no, musical, connections, and, was, initially, unsure, whether, to, pursue, a, career, as, a, lawyer, or, to, make, a, living, as, a, pianist, composer, he, studied, law, at, the, universities, of, leipzig, and, heidelberg, but, his, main, interests, were, music, and, romantic, literature, from, 1829, he, was, a, student, of, the, piano, teacher, friedrich, wieck, but, his, hopes, for, a, career, as, a, virtuoso, pianist, were, frustrated, by, a, worsening, problem, with, his, right, hand, and, he, concentrated, on, composition, his, early, works, were, mainly, piano, pieces, including, the, large, scale, carnaval, davidsb, ndlert, nze, fantasiest, cke, fantasy, pieces, kreisleriana, and, kinderszenen, scenes, from, childhood, 1834, 1838, he, was, a, co, founder, of, the, neue, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, new, musical, journal, in, 1834, and, edited, it, for, ten, years, in, his, writing, for, the, journal, and, in, his, music, he, distinguished, between, two, contrasting, aspects, of, his, personality, dubbing, these, alter, egos, florestan, for, his, impetuous, self, and, eusebius, for, his, gentle, poetic, side, despite, the, bitter, opposition, of, wieck, who, did, not, regard, his, pupil, as, a, suitable, husband, for, his, daughter, schumann, married, wieck, s, daughter, clara, in, 1840, in, the, years, immediately, following, their, wedding, schumann, composed, prolifically, writing, first, songs, and, song, cycles, including, frauenliebe, und, leben, woman, s, love, and, life, and, dichterliebe, poet, s, love, he, turned, his, attention, to, orchestral, music, in, 1841, completing, the, first, of, his, four, symphonies, in, the, following, year, he, concentrated, on, chamber, music, writing, three, string, quartets, a, piano, quintet, and, a, piano, quartet, during, the, rest, of, the, 1840s, between, bouts, of, mental, and, physical, ill, health, he, composed, a, variety, of, piano, and, other, pieces, and, went, with, his, wife, on, concert, tours, in, europe, his, only, opera, genoveva, 1850, was, not, a, success, and, has, seldom, been, staged, since, schumann, and, his, family, moved, to, d, sseldorf, in, 1850, in, the, hope, that, his, appointment, as, the, city, s, director, of, music, would, provide, financial, security, but, his, shyness, and, mental, instability, made, it, difficult, for, him, to, work, with, his, orchestra, and, he, had, to, resign, after, three, years, in, 1853, the, schumanns, met, the, twenty, year, old, johannes, brahms, whom, schumann, praised, in, an, article, in, the, neue, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, the, following, year, schumann, s, always, precarious, mental, health, deteriorated, gravely, he, threw, himself, into, the, river, rhine, but, was, rescued, and, taken, to, a, private, sanatorium, near, bonn, where, he, lived, for, more, than, two, years, dying, there, at, the, age, of, 46, during, his, lifetime, schumann, was, recognised, for, his, piano, music, often, subtly, programmatic, and, his, songs, his, other, works, were, less, generally, admired, and, for, many, years, there, was, a, widespread, belief, that, those, from, his, later, years, lacked, the, inspiration, of, his, early, music, more, recently, this, view, has, been, less, prevalent, but, it, is, still, his, piano, works, and, songs, from, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, on, which, his, reputation, is, primarily, based, he, had, considerable, influence, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, beyond, in, the, german, speaking, world, the, composers, gustav, mahler, richard, strauss, arnold, schoenberg, and, more, recently, wolfgang, rihm, have, been, inspired, by, his, music, as, were, french, composers, such, as, georges, bizet, gabriel, faur, claude, debussy, and, maurice, ravel, schumann, was, a, major, influence, on, the, russian, school, of, composers, including, anton, rubinstein, and, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, robert, schumann, was, born, in, zwickau, in, the, kingdom, of, saxony, today, the, german, state, of, saxony, into, an, affluent, middle, class, family, on, 13, june, 1810, the, local,

gottlieb, meissner, throughout, his, childhood, and, youth, his, love, of, music, and, literature, ran, in, tandem, with, poems, and, dramatic, works, produced, alongside, small, scale, compositions, mainly, piano, pieces, and, songs, he, was, not, a, musical, child, prodigy, like, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, or, felix, mendelssohn, but, his, talent, as, a, pianist, was, evident, from, an, early, age, in, 1850, the, allgemeine, musikalische, zeitung, universal, musical, journal, printed, a, biographical, sketch, of, schumann, which, included, an, account, from, contemporary, sources, that, even, as, a, boy, he, possessed, a, special, talent, for, portraying, feelings, and, characteristic, traits, in, melody, from, 1820, schumann, attended, the, zwickau, lyceum, the, local, high, school, of, about, two, hundred, boys, where, he, remained, till, the, age, of, eighteen, studying, a, traditional, curriculum, in, addition, to, his, studies, he, read, extensively, among, his, early, enthusiasms, were, schiller, and, jean, paul, according, to, the, musical, historian, george, hall, paul, remained, schumann, s, favourite, author, and, exercised, a, powerful, influence, on, the, composer, s, creativity, with, his, sensibility, and, vein, of, fantasy, musically, schumann, got, to, know, the, works, of, haydn, mozart, beethoven, and, of, living, composers, carl, maria, von, weber, with, whom, august, schumann, tried, unsuccessfully, to, arrange, for, robert, to, study, august, was, not, particularly, musical, but, he, encouraged, his, son, s, interest, in, music, buying, him, a, streicher, grand, piano, and, organising, trips, to, leipzig, for, a, performance, of, die, zauberfl, te, the, magic, flute, and, carlsbad, to, hear, the, celebrated, pianist, ignaz, moscheles, august, schumann, died, in, 1826, his, widow, was, less, enthusiastic, about, a, musical, career, for, her, son, and, persuaded, him, to, study, for, the, law, as, a, profession, after, his, final, examinations, at, the, lyceum, in, march, 1828, he, entered, leipzig, university, accounts, differ, about, his, diligence, as, a, law, student, according, to, his, roommate, emil, flechsig, he, never, set, foot, in, a, lecture, hall, but, he, himself, recorded, i, am, industrious, and, regular, and, enjoy, my, jurisprudence, and, am, only, now, beginning, to, appreciate, its, true, worth, nonetheless, reading, and, playing, the, piano, occupied, a, good, deal, of, his, time, and, he, developed, expensive, tastes, for, champagne, and, cigars, musically, he, discovered, the, works, of, franz, schubert, whose, death, in, november, 1828, caused, schumann, to, cry, all, night, the, leading, piano, teacher, in, leipzig, was, friedrich, wieck, who, recognised, schumann, s, talent, and, accepted, him, as, a, pupil, after, a, year, in, leipzig, schumann, convinced, his, mother, that, he, should, move, to, the, university, of, heidelberg, which, unlike, leipzig, offered, courses, in, roman, ecclesiastical, and, international, law, as, well, as, reuniting, schumann, with, his, close, friend, eduard, r, ller, who, was, a, student, there, after, matriculating, at, the, university, on, 30, july, 1829, he, travelled, in, switzerland, and, italy, from, late, august, to, late, october, he, was, greatly, taken, with, rossini, s, operas, and, the, bel, canto, of, the, soprano, giuditta, pasta, he, wrote, to, wieck, one, can, have, no, notion, of, italian, music, without, hearing, it, under, italian, skies, another, influence, on, him, was, hearing, the, violin, virtuoso, niccol, paganini, play, in, frankfurt, in, april, 1830, in, the, words, of, one, biographer, the, easy, going, discipline, at, heidelberg, university, helped, the, world, to, lose, a, bad, lawyer, and, to, gain, a, great, musician, finally, deciding, in, favour, of, music, rather, than, the, law, as, a, career, he, wrote, to, his, mother, on, 30, july, 1830, telling, her, how, he, saw, his, future, my, entire, life, has, been, a, twenty, year, struggle, between, poetry, and, prose, or, call, it, music, and, law, he, persuaded, her, to, ask, wieck, for, an, objective, assessment, of, his, musical, potential, wieck, s, verdict, was, that, with, the, necessary, hard, work, schumann, could, become, a, leading, pianist, within, three, years, a, six, month, trial, period, was, agreed, later, in, 1830, schumann, published, his, op, 1, a, set, of, piano, variations, on, a, theme, based, on, the, name, of, its, supposed, dedicatee, countess, pauline, von, abegg, who, was, almost, certainly, a, product, of, schumann, s, imagination, the, notes, a, b, e, g, g, played, in, waltz, tempo, make, up, the, theme, on, which, the, variations, are, based, the, use, of, a, musical, cryptogram, became, a, recurrent, characteristic, of, schumann, s, later, music, in, 1831, he, began, lessons, in, harmony, and, counterpoint, with, heinrich, dorn, musical, director, of, the, saxon, court, theatre, and, in, 1832, he, published, his, op, 2, papillons, butterflies, for, piano, a, programmatic, piece, depicting, twin, brothers, one, a, poetic, dreamer, the, other, a, worldly, realist, both, in, love, with, the, same, woman, at, a, masked, ball, schumann, had, by, now, come, to, regard, himself, as, having, two, distinct, sides, to, his, personality, and, art, he, dubbed, his, introspective, pensive, self, eusebius, and, the, impetuous, and, dynamic, alter, ego, florestan, reviewing, an, early, work, of, chopin, in, 1831, he, wrote, schumann, s, pianistic, ambitions, were, ended, by, a, growing, paralysis, in, at, least, one, finger, of, his, right, hand, the, early, symptoms, had, come, while, he, was, still, a, student, at, heidelberg, and, the, cause, is, uncertain, he, tried, all, the, treatments, then, in, vogue, including, allopathy, homeopathy, and, electric, therapy, but, without, success, the, condition, had, the, advantage, of, exempting, him, from, compulsory, military, service, he, could, not, fire, a, rifle, but, by, 1832, he, recognised, that, a, career, as, a, virtuoso, pianist, was, impossible, and, he, shifted, his, main, focus, to, composition, he, completed, further, sets, of, small, piano, pieces, and, the, first, movement, of, a, symphony, it, was, too, thinly, orchestrated, according, to, wieck, and, was, never, completed, an, additional, activity, was, journalism, from, march, 1834, along, with, wieck, and, others, he, was, on, the, editorial, board, of, a, new, music, magazine, neue, leipziger, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, new, leipzig, music, magazine, which, was, reconstituted, under, his, sole, editorship, in, january, 1835, as, the, neue, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, hall, writes, that, it, took, a, thoughtful, and, progressive, line, on, the, new, music, of, the, day, among, the, contributors, were, friends, and, colleagues, of, schumann, writing, under, pen, names, he, included, them, in, his, davidsb, ndler, league, of, david, a, band, of, fighters, for, musical, truth, named, after, the, biblical, hero, who, fought, against, the, philistines, a, product, of, the, composer, s, imagination, in, which, blurring, the, boundaries, of, imagination, and, reality, he, included, his, musical, friends, during, successive, months, in, 1835, schumann, met, three, musicians, whom, he, regarded, with, particular, respect, felix, mendelssohn, chopin, and, moscheles, of, these, he, was, most, influenced, in, his, compositions, by, mendelssohn, although, the, latter, s, restrained, classicism, is, reflected, in, schumann, s, later, works, rather, than, in, those, of, the, 1830s, early, in, 1835, he, completed, two, substantial, compositions, carnaval, op, 9, and, the, symphonic, studies, op, 13, these, works, grew, out, of, his, romantic, relationship, with, ernestine, von, fricken, a, fellow, pupil, of, wieck, the, musical, themes, of, carnaval, derive, from, the, name, of, her, home, town, asch, the, symphonic, studies, are, based, on, a, melody, said, to, be, by, ernestine, s, father, baron, von, fricken, an, amateur, flautist, schumann, and, ernestine, became, secretly, engaged, but, in, the, view, of, the, musical, scholar, joan, chissell, during, 1835, schumann, gradually, found, that, ernestine, s, personality, was, not, as, interesting, to, him, as, he, first, thought, and, this, together, with, his, discovery, that, she, was, an, illegitimate, impecunious, adopted, daughter, of, fricken, brought, the, affair, to, a, gradual, end, according, to, the, biographer, alan, walker, ernestine, may, have, been, less, than, frank, with, schumann, about, her, background, and, he, was, hurt, when, he, learnt, the, truth, schumann, felt, a, growing, attraction, to, wieck, s, daughter, the, sixteen, year, old, clara, she, was, her, father, s, star, pupil, a, piano, virtuoso, emotionally, mature, beyond, her, years, with, a, developing, reputation, according, to, chissell, her, concerto, debut, at, the, leipzig, gewandhaus, on, 9, november, 1835, with, mendelssohn, conducting, set, the, seal, on, all, her, earlier, successes, and, there, was, now, no, doubting, that, a, great, future, lay, before, her, as, a, pianist, schumann, had, watched, her, career, approvingly, since, she, was, nine, but, only, now, fell, in, love, with, her, his, feelings, were, reciprocated, they, declared, their, love, to, each, other, in, january, 1836, schumann, expected, that, wieck, would, welcome, the, proposed, marriage, but, he, was, mistaken, wieck, refused, his, consent, fearing, that, schumann, would, be, unable, to, provide, for, his, daughter, that, she, would, have, to, abandon, her, career, and, that, she, would, be, legally, required, to, relinquish, her, inheritance, to, her, husband, it, took, a, series, of, acrimonious, legal, actions, over, the, next, four, years, for, schumann, to, obtain, a, court, ruling, that, he, and, clara, were, free, to, marry, without, her, father, s, consent, professionally, the, later, years, of, the, 1830s, were, marked, by, an, unsuccessful, attempt, by, schumann, to, establish, himself, in, vienna, and, a, growing, friendship, with, mendelssohn, who, was, by, then, based, in, leipzig, conducting, the, gewandhaus, orchestra, during, this, period, schumann, wrote, many, piano, works, including, kreisleriana, 1837, davidsb, ndlert, nze, 1837, kinderszenen, scenes, from, childhood, 1838, and, faschingsschwank, aus, wien, carnival, prank, from, vienna, 1839, in, 1838, schumann, visited, schubert, s, brother, ferdinand, and, discovered, several, manuscripts, including, that, of, the, great, c, major, symphony, ferdinand, allowed, him, to, take, a, copy, away, and, schumann, arranged, for, the, work, s, premiere, conducted, by, mendelssohn, in, leipzig, on, 21, march, 1839, in, the, neue, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, schumann, wrote, enthusiastically, about, the, work, and, described, its, himmlische, l, nge, its, heavenly, length, a, phrase, that, has, become, common, currency, in, later, analyses, of, the, symphony, schumann, and, clara, finally, married, on, 12, september, 1840, the, day, before, her, twenty, first, birthday, hall, writes, that, marriage, gave, schumann, the, emotional, and, domestic, stability, on, which, his, subsequent, achievements, were, founded, clara, made, some, sacrifices, in, marrying, schumann, as, a, pianist, of, international, reputation, she, was, the, better, known, of, the, two, but, her, career, was, continually, interrupted, by, motherhood, of, their, seven, children, she, inspired, schumann, in, his, composing, career, encouraging, him, to, extend, his, range, as, a, composer, beyond, solo, piano, works, during, 1840, schumann, turned, his, attention, to, song, producing, more, than, half, his, total, output, of, lieder, including, the, cycles, myrthen, myrtles, a, wedding, present, for, clara, frauenliebe, und, leben, woman, s, love, and, life, dichterliebe, poet, s, love, and, settings, of, words, by, joseph, von, eichendorff, heinrich, heine, and, others, in, 1841, schumann, focused, on, orchestral, music, on, 31, march, his, first, symphony, the, spring, was, premiered, by, mendelssohn, at, a, concert, in, the, gewandhaus, at, which, clara, played, chopin, s, second, piano, concerto, and, some, of, schumann, s, works, for, solo, piano, his, next, orchestral, works, were, the, overture, scherzo, and, finale, the, phantasie, for, piano, and, orchestra, which, later, became, the, first, movement, of, the, piano, concerto, and, a, new, symphony, eventually, published, as, the, fourth, in, d, minor, clara, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, in, september, the, first, of, the, schumanns, seven, children, to, survive, the, following, year, schumann, turned, his, attention, to, chamber, music, he, studied, works, by, haydn, and, mozart, despite, an, ambivalent, attitude, to, the, former, writing, today, it, is, impossible, to, learn, anything, new, from, him, he, is, like, a, familiar, friend, of, the, house, whom, all, greet, with, pleasure, and, with, esteem, but, who, has, ceased, to, arouse, any, particular, interest, he, was, stronger, in, his, praise, of, mozart, serenity, repose, grace, the, characteristics, of, the, antique, works, of, art, are, also, those, of, mozart, s, school, the, greeks, gave, to, the, thunderer, a, radiant, expression, and, radiantly, does, mozart, launch, his, lightnings, after, his, studies, schumann, produced, three, string, quartets, a, piano, quintet, premiered, in, 1843, and, a, piano, quartet, premiered, in, 1844, in, early, 1843, there, was, a, setback, to, schumann, s, career, he, had, a, severe, and, debilitating, mental, crisis, this, was, not, the, first, such, attack, although, it, was, the, worst, so, far, hall, writes, that, he, had, been, subject, to, similar, attacks, at, intervals, over, a, long, period, and, comments, that, the, condition, may, have, been, congenital, affecting, august, schumann, and, emilie, the, composer, s, sister, later, in, the, year, schumann, having, recovered, completed, a, successful, secular, oratorio, das, paradies, und, die, peri, paradise, and, the, peri, based, on, an, oriental, poem, by, thomas, moore, it, was, premiered, at, the, gewandhaus, on, 4, december, and, repeat, performances, followed, at, dresden, on, 23, december, berlin, early, the, following, year, and, london, in, june, 1856, when, schumann, s, friend, william, sterndale, bennett, conducted, a, performance, given, by, the, philharmonic, society, before, queen, victoria, and, the, prince, consort, although, neglected, after, schumann, s, death, it, remained, popular, throughout, his, lifetime, and, brought, his, name, to, international, attention, during, 1843, mendelssohn, invited, him, to, teach, piano, and, composition, at, the, new, leipzig, conservatory, and, wieck, approached, him, with, an, offer, of, reconciliation, schumann, gladly, accepted, both, although, the, resumed, relationship, with, his, father, in, law, remained, polite, rather, than, close, in, 1844, clara, embarked, on, a, concert, tour, of, russia, her, husband, joined, her, they, met, the, leading, figures, of, the, russian, musical, scene, including, mikhail, glinka, and, anton, rubinstein, and, were, both, immensely, impressed, by, saint, petersburg, and, moscow, the, tour, was, an, artistic, and, financial, success, but, it, was, arduous, and, by, the, end, schumann, was, in, a, poor, state, both, physically, and, mentally, after, the, couple, returned, to, leipzig, in, late, may, he, sold, the, neue, zeitschrift, and, in, december, the, family, moved, to, dresden, schumann, had, been, passed, over, for, the, conductorship, of, the, leipzig, gewandhaus, in, succession, to, mendelssohn, and, he, thought, that, dresden, with, a, thriving, opera, house, might, be, the, place, where, he, could, as, he, now, wished, become, an, operatic, composer, his, health, remained, poor, his, doctor, in, dresden, reported, complaints, from, insomnia, general, weakness, auditory, disturbances, tremors, and, chills, in, the, feet, to, a, whole, range, of, phobias, from, the, beginning, of, 1845, schumann, s, health, began, to, improve, he, and, clara, studied, counterpoint, together, and, both, produced, contrapuntal, works, for, the, piano, he, added, a, slow, movement, and, finale, to, the, 1841, phantasie, for, piano, and, orchestra, to, create, his, piano, concerto, op, 54, the, following, year, he, worked, on, what, was, to, be, published, as, his, second, symphony, op, 61, progress, on, the, work, was, slow, interrupted, by, further, bouts, of, ill, health, when, the, symphony, was, complete, he, began, work, on, his, opera, genoveva, which, was, not, completed, until, august, 1848, between, 24, november, 1846, and, 4, february, 1847, the, schumanns, toured, to, vienna, berlin, and, other, cities, the, viennese, leg, of, the, tour, was, not, a, success, the, performance, of, schumann, s, first, symphony, and, piano, concerto, at, the, musikverein, on, 1, january, 1847, attracted, a, sparse, and, unenthusiastic, audience, but, in, berlin, the, performance, of, das, paradies, und, die, peri, was, well, received, and, the, tour, gave, schumann, the, chance, to, see, numerous, operatic, productions, in, the, words, of, grove, s, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, a, regular, if, not, always, approving, member, of, the, audience, at, performances, of, works, by, donizetti, rossini, meyerbeer, hal, vy, and, flotow, he, registered, his, desire, to, write, operas, in, his, travel, diary, the, schumanns, suffered, several, blows, during, 1847, including, the, death, of, their, first, son, emil, born, the, year, before, and, the, deaths, of, their, friends, felix, and, fanny, mendelssohn, a, second, son, ludwig, and, a, third, ferdinand, were, born, in, 1848, and, 1849, genoveva, a, four, act, opera, based, on, the, medieval, legend, of, genevieve, of, brabant, was, premiered, in, leipzig, conducted, by, the, composer, in, june, 1850, there, were, two, further, performances, immediately, afterwards, but, the, piece, was, not, the, success, schumann, had, been, hoping, for, in, a, 2005, study, of, the, composer, eric, frederick, jensen, attributes, this, to, schumann, s, operatic, style, not, tuneful, and, simplistic, enough, for, the, majority, not, progressive, enough, for, the, wagnerians, franz, liszt, who, was, in, the, first, night, audience, revived, genoveva, at, weimar, in, 1855, the, only, other, production, of, the, opera, in, schumann, s, lifetime, since, then, according, to, kobb, s, opera, book, despite, occasional, revivals, genoveva, has, remained, far, from, even, the, edge, of, the, repertory, with, a, large, family, to, support, schumann, sought, financial, security, and, with, the, support, of, his, wife, he, accepted, a, post, as, director, of, music, at, d, sseldorf, in, april, 1850, hall, comments, that, in, retrospect, it, can, be, seen, that, schumann, was, fundamentally, unsuited, for, the, post, in, hall, s, view, schumann, s, diffidence, in, social, situations, allied, to, mental, instability, ensured, that, initially, warm, relations, with, local, musicians, gradually, deteriorated, to, the, point, where, his, removal, became, a, necessity, in, 1853, during, 1850, schumann, composed, two, substantial, late, works, the, third, rhenish, symphony, and, the, cello, concerto, he, continued, to, compose, prolifically, and, reworked, some, of, his, earlier, works, including, the, d, minor, symphony, from, 1841, published, as, his, fourth, symphony, 1851, and, the, 1835, symphonic, studies, 1852, in, 1853, the, twenty, year, old, johannes, brahms, called, on, schumann, with, a, letter, of, introduction, from, a, mutual, friend, the, violinist, joseph, joachim, brahms, had, recently, written, the, first, of, his, three, piano, sonatas, and, played, it, to, schumann, who, rushed, excitedly, out, of, the, room, and, came, back, leading, his, wife, by, the, hand, saying, now, my, dear, clara, you, will, hear, such, music, as, you, never, heard, before, and, you, young, man, play, the, work, from, the, beginning, schumann, was, so, impressed, that, he, wrote, an, article, his, last, for, the, neue, zeitschrift, f, r, musik, titled, neue, bahnen, new, paths, extolling, brahms, as, a, musician, who, was, destined, to, give, expression, to, his, times, in, ideal, fashion, hall, writes, that, brahms, proved, a, personal, tower, of, strength, to, clara, during, the, difficult, days, ahead, in, early, 1854, schumann, s, health, deteriorated, drastically, on, 27, february, he, attempted, suicide, by, throwing, himself, into, the, river, rhine, he, was, rescued, by, fishermen, and, at, his, own, request, he, was, admitted, to, a, private, sanatorium, at, endenich, near, bonn, on, 4, march, he, remained, there, for, more, than, two, years, gradually, deteriorating, with, intermittent, intervals, of, lucidity, during, which, he, wrote, and, received, letters, and, sometimes, essayed, some, composition, the, director, of, the, sanatorium, held, that, direct, contact, between, patients, and, relatives, was, likely, to, distress, all, concerned, and, reduce, the, chances, of, recovery, friends, including, brahms, and, joachim, were, permitted, to, visit, schumann, but, clara, did, not, see, her, husband, until, nearly, two, and, a, half, years, into, his, confinement, and, only, two, days, before, his, death, schumann, died, at, the, sanatorium, aged, 46, on, 29, july, 1856, the, cause, of, death, being, recorded, as, pneumonia, baker, s, biographical, dictionary, of, musicians, 2001, begins, its, entry, on, schumann, reat, german, composer, of, surpassing, imaginative, power, whose, music, expressed, the, deepest, spirit, of, the, romantic, era, and, concludes, as, both, man, and, musician, schumann, is, recognized, as, the, quintessential, artist, of, the, romantic, period, in, german, music, he, was, a, master, of, lyric, expression, and, dramatic, power, perhaps, best, revealed, in, his, outstanding, piano, music, and, songs, schumann, believed, the, aesthetics, of, all, the, arts, were, identical, in, his, music, he, aimed, at, a, conception, of, art, in, which, the, poetic, was, the, main, element, according, to, the, musicologist, carl, dahlhaus, for, schumann, music, was, supposed, to, turn, into, a, tone, poem, to, rise, above, the, realm, of, the, trivial, of, tonal, mechanics, by, means, of, its, spirituality, and, soulfulness, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, and, most, of, the, twentieth, it, was, widely, held, that, the, music, of, schumann, s, later, years, was, less, inspired, than, his, earlier, works, up, to, about, the, mid, 1840s, either, because, of, his, declining, health, or, because, his, increasingly, orthodox, approach, to, composition, deprived, his, music, of, the, romantic, spontaneity, of, the, earlier, works, the, late, nineteenth, century, composer, felix, draeseke, commented, schumann, started, as, a, genius, and, ended, as, a, talent, in, the, view, of, the, composer, and, oboeist, heinz, holliger, certain, works, of, his, early, and, middle, period, are, praised, to, the, skies, while, on, the, other, hand, a, pious, veil, of, silence, obscures, the, more, sober, austere, and, concentrated, works, of, the, late, period, more, recently, the, later, works, have, been, viewed, more, favourably, hall, suggests, that, this, is, because, they, are, now, played, more, often, in, concert, and, in, recording, studios, and, have, the, beneficial, effects, of, period, performance, practice, as, it, has, come, to, be, applied, to, mid, 19th, century, music, schumann, s, works, in, some, other, musical, genres, particularly, orchestral, and, operatic, works, have, had, a, mixed, critical, reception, both, during, his, lifetime, and, since, but, there, is, widespread, agreement, about, the, high, quality, of, his, solo, piano, music, in, his, youth, the, familiar, austro, german, tradition, of, bach, mozart, and, beethoven, was, temporarily, eclipsed, by, a, fashion, for, the, flamboyant, showpieces, of, composers, such, as, moscheles, schumann, s, first, published, work, the, abegg, variations, is, in, the, latter, style, but, he, revered, the, earlier, german, masters, and, in, his, three, piano, sonatas, composed, between, 1830, and, 1836, and, the, fantasie, in, c, 1836, he, showed, his, respect, for, the, earlier, austro, german, tradition, absolute, music, such, as, those, works, is, in, the, minority, in, his, piano, compositions, of, which, many, are, what, hall, calls, character, pieces, with, fanciful, names, schumann, s, most, characteristic, form, in, his, piano, music, is, the, cycle, of, short, interrelated, pieces, often, programmatic, though, seldom, explicitly, so, they, include, carnaval, fantasiest, cke, kreisleriana, kinderszenen, and, waldszenen, wood, scenes, the, critic, j, a, fuller, maitland, wrote, of, the, first, of, these, of, all, the, pianoforte, works, is, perhaps, the, most, popular, its, wonderful, animation, and, never, ending, variety, ensure, the, production, of, its, full, effect, and, its, great, and, various, difficulties, make, it, the, best, possible, test, of, a, pianist, s, skill, and, versatility, schumann, continually, inserted, into, his, piano, works, veiled, allusions, to, himself, and, others, particularly, clara, in, the, form, of, ciphers, and, musical, quotations, his, self, references, include, both, the, impetuous, florestan, and, the, poetic, eusebius, elements, he, identified, in, himself, although, some, of, his, music, is, technically, challenging, for, the, pianist, schumann, also, wrote, simpler, pieces, for, young, players, the, best, known, of, which, are, his, album, f, r, die, jugend, album, for, the, young, 1848, and, three, sonatas, for, young, people, 1853, he, also, wrote, some, undemanding, music, with, an, eye, to, commercial, sales, including, the, blumenst, ck, flower, piece, and, arabeske, both, 1839, which, he, privately, considered, feeble, and, intended, for, the, ladies, the, authors, of, the, record, guide, describe, schumann, as, one, of, the, four, supreme, masters, of, the, german, lied, alongside, schubert, brahms, and, hugo, wolf, the, pianist, gerald, moore, wrote, that, after, the, unparalleled, franz, schubert, schumann, shares, the, second, place, in, the, hierarchy, of, the, lied, with, wolf, grove, s, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, classes, schumann, as, the, true, heir, of, schubert, in, lieder, schumann, wrote, more, than, 300, songs, for, voice, and, piano, they, are, known, for, the, quality, of, the, texts, he, set, hall, comments, that, the, composer, s, youthful, appreciation, of, literature, was, constantly, renewed, in, adult, life, although, schumann, greatly, admired, goethe, and, schiller, and, set, a, few, of, their, verses, his, favoured, poets, for, lyrics, were, the, later, romantics, such, as, heine, eichendorff, and, m, rike, among, the, best, known, of, the, songs, are, those, in, four, cycles, composed, in, 1840, a, year, schumann, called, his, liederjahr, year, of, song, these, are, dichterliebe, poet, s, love, comprising, sixteen, songs, with, words, by, heine, frauenliebe, und, leben, woman, s, love, and, life, eight, songs, setting, poems, by, adelbert, von, chamisso, and, two, sets, simply, titled, liederkreis, german, for, song, cycle, the, op, 24, set, consisting, of, nine, heine, settings, and, the, op, 39, set, of, twelve, settings, of, poems, by, eichendorff, also, from, 1840, is, the, set, schumann, wrote, as, a, wedding, present, to, clara, myrthen, myrtles, traditionally, part, of, a, bride, s, wedding, bouquet, which, the, composer, called, a, song, cycle, although, comprising, twenty, six, songs, with, lyrics, from, ten, different, writers, this, set, is, a, less, unified, cycle, than, the, others, in, a, study, of, schumann, s, songs, eric, sams, suggests, that, even, here, there, is, a, unifying, theme, namely, the, composer, himself, although, during, the, twentieth, century, it, became, common, practice, to, perform, these, cycles, as, a, whole, in, schumann, s, time, and, beyond, it, was, usual, to, extract, individual, songs, for, performance, in, recitals, the, first, documented, public, performance, of, a, complete, schumann, song, cycle, was, not, until, 1861, five, years, after, the, composer, s, death, the, baritone, julius, stockhausen, sang, dichterliebe, with, brahms, at, the, piano, stockhausen, also, gave, the, first, complete, performances, of, frauenliebe, und, leben, and, the, op, 24, liederkreis, after, his, liederjahr, schumann, returned, in, earnest, to, writing, songs, after, a, break, of, several, years, hall, describes, the, variety, of, the, songs, as, immense, and, comments, that, some, of, the, later, songs, are, entirely, different, in, mood, from, the, composer, s, earlier, romantic, settings, schumann, s, literary, sensibilities, led, him, to, create, in, his, songs, an, equal, partnership, between, words, and, music, unprecedented, in, the, german, lied, his, affinity, with, the, piano, is, heard, in, his, accompaniments, to, his, songs, notably, in, their, preludes, and, postludes, the, latter, often, summing, up, what, has, been, heard, in, the, song, schumann, acknowledged, that, he, found, orchestration, a, difficult, art, to, master, and, many, analysts, have, criticised, his, orchestral, writing, conductors, including, gustav, mahler, max, reger, arturo, toscanini, otto, klemperer, and, george, szell, have, made, changes, to, the, instrumentation, before, conducting, his, orchestral, music, the, music, scholar, julius, harrison, considers, such, alterations, fruitless, the, essence, of, schumann, s, warmly, vibrant, music, resides, in, its, forthright, romantic, appeal, with, all, those, personal, traits, lovable, characteristic, and, faults, that, make, up, schumann, s, artistic, character, hall, comments, that, schumann, s, orchestration, has, subsequently, been, more, highly, regarded, because, of, a, trend, towards, playing, the, orchestral, music, with, smaller, forces, in, historically, informed, performance, after, the, successful, premiere, in, 1841, of, the, first, of, his, four, symphonies, the, allgemeine, musikalische, zeitung, described, it, as, well, and, fluently, written, also, for, the, most, part, knowledgeably, tastefully, and, often, quite, successfully, and, effectively, orchestrated, although, a, later, critic, called, it, inflated, piano, music, with, mainly, routine, orchestration, later, in, the, year, a, second, symphony, was, premiered, and, was, less, enthusiastically, received, schumann, revised, it, ten, years, later, and, published, it, as, his, fourth, symphony, brahms, preferred, the, original, more, lightly, scored, version, which, is, occasionally, performed, and, has, been, recorded, but, the, revised, 1851, score, is, more, usually, played, the, work, now, called, the, second, symphony, 1846, is, structurally, the, most, classical, of, the, four, and, is, influenced, by, beethoven, and, schubert, the, third, symphony, 1851, known, as, the, rhenish, is, unusually, for, a, symphony, of, its, day, in, five, movements, and, is, the, composer, s, nearest, approach, to, pictorial, symphonic, music, with, movements, depicting, a, solemn, religious, ceremony, in, cologne, cathedral, and, outdoor, merrymaking, of, rhinelanders, schumann, experimented, with, unconventional, symphonic, forms, in, 1841, in, his, overture, scherzo, and, finale, op, 52, sometimes, described, as, a, symphony, without, a, slow, movement, its, unorthodox, structure, may, have, made, it, less, appealing, and, it, is, not, often, performed, schumann, composed, six, overtures, three, of, them, for, theatrical, performance, preceding, byron, s, manfred, 1852, goethe, s, faust, 1853, and, his, own, genoveva, the, other, three, were, stand, alone, concert, works, inspired, by, schiller, s, the, bride, of, messina, shakespeare, s, julius, caesar, and, goethe, s, hermann, and, dorothea, the, piano, concerto, 1845, quickly, became, and, has, remained, one, of, the, most, popular, romantic, piano, concertos, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, when, the, symphonies, were, less, well, regarded, than, they, later, became, the, concerto, was, described, in, the, record, guide, as, the, one, large, scale, work, of, schumann, s, which, is, by, general, consent, an, entire, success, the, pianist, susan, tomes, comments, in, the, era, of, recording, it, has, often, been, paired, with, grieg, s, piano, concerto, also, in, a, minor, which, clearly, shows, the, influence, of, schumann, s, the, first, movement, pitches, against, each, other, the, forthright, florestan, and, dreamy, eusebius, elements, in, schumann, s, artistic, nature, the, vigorous, opening, bars, succeeded, by, the, wistful, a, minor, theme, that, enters, in, the, fourth, bar, no, other, concerto, or, concertante, work, by, schumann, has, approached, the, popularity, of, the, piano, concerto, but, the, concert, piece, for, four, horns, and, orchestra, 1849, and, the, cello, concerto, 1850, remain, in, the, concert, repertoire, and, are, well, represented, on, record, the, late, violin, concerto, 1853, is, less, often, heard, but, has, received, several, recordings, schumann, composed, a, substantial, quantity, of, chamber, pieces, of, which, the, best, known, and, most, performed, are, the, piano, quintet, in, e, major, op, 44, the, piano, quartet, in, the, same, key, both, 1842, and, three, piano, trios, the, first, and, second, from, 1847, and, the, third, from, 1851, the, quintet, was, written, for, and, dedicated, to, clara, schumann, it, is, described, by, the, musicologist, linda, correll, roesner, as, a, very, public, and, brilliant, work, that, nonetheless, manages, to, incorporate, a, private, message, by, quoting, a, theme, composed, by, clara, schumann, s, writing, for, piano, and, string, quartet, two, violins, one, viola, and, one, cello, was, in, contrast, with, earlier, piano, quintets, with, different, combinations, of, instruments, such, as, schubert, s, trout, quintet, 1819, schumann, s, ensemble, became, the, template, for, later, composers, including, brahms, franck, faur, dvo, k, and, elgar, roesner, describes, the, quartet, as, equally, brilliant, as, the, quintet, but, also, more, intimate, schumann, composed, a, set, of, three, string, quartets, op, 41, 1842, dahlhaus, comments, that, after, this, schumann, avoided, writing, for, string, quartet, finding, beethoven, s, achievements, in, that, genre, daunting, among, the, later, chamber, works, are, the, sonata, in, a, minor, for, piano, and, violin, op, 105, the, first, of, three, chamber, pieces, written, in, a, two, month, period, of, intense, creativity, in, 1851, followed, by, the, third, piano, trio, and, the, sonata, in, d, minor, for, violin, and, piano, op, 121, in, addition, to, his, chamber, works, for, what, were, or, were, becoming, standard, combinations, of, instruments, schumann, wrote, for, some, unusual, groupings, and, was, often, flexible, about, which, instruments, a, work, called, for, in, his, adagio, and, allegro, op, 70, the, pianist, may, according, to, the, composer, be, joined, by, either, a, horn, a, violin, or, a, cello, and, in, the, fantasiest, cke, op, 73, the, pianist, may, be, duetting, with, a, clarinet, violin, or, cello, his, andante, and, variations, 1843, for, two, pianos, two, cellos, and, a, horn, later, became, a, piece, for, just, the, pianos, genoveva, was, not, a, great, success, in, schumann, s, lifetime, and, has, continued, to, be, a, rarity, in, the, opera, house, from, its, premiere, onwards, the, work, was, criticised, on, the, grounds, that, it, is, an, evening, of, lieder, and, nothing, much, else, happens, the, conductor, nikolaus, harnoncourt, who, championed, the, work, blamed, music, critics, for, the, low, esteem, in, which, the, work, is, held, he, maintained, that, they, all, approached, the, work, with, a, preconceived, idea, of, what, an, opera, must, be, like, and, finding, that, genoveva, did, not, match, their, preconceptions, they, condemned, it, out, of, hand, in, harnoncourt, s, view, it, is, a, mistake, to, look, for, a, dramatic, plot, in, this, opera, harnoncourt, s, view, of, the, lack, of, drama, in, the, opera, contrasts, with, that, of, victoria, bond, who, conducted, the, work, s, first, professional, stage, production, in, the, us, in, 1987, she, finds, the, work, full, of, high, drama, and, supercharged, emotion, in, my, opinion, it, s, very, stageworthy, too, it, s, not, at, all, static, unlike, the, opera, schumann, s, secular, oratorio, das, paradies, und, die, peri, was, an, enormous, success, in, his, lifetime, although, it, has, since, been, neglected, the, conductor, sir, simon, rattle, called, it, the, great, masterpiece, you, ve, never, heard, and, there, aren, t, many, of, those, now, in, schumann, s, life, it, was, the, most, popular, piece, he, ever, wrote, it, was, performed, endlessly, every, composer, loved, it, wagner, wrote, how, jealous, he, was, that, schumann, had, done, it, based, on, an, episode, from, thomas, moore, s, epic, poem, lalla, rookh, it, reflects, the, exotic, colourful, tales, from, persian, mythology, popular, in, the, nineteenth, century, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, in, 1843, schumann, said, at, the, moment, i, m, involved, in, a, large, project, the, largest, i, ve, yet, undertaken, it, s, not, an, opera, i, believe, it, s, well, nigh, a, new, genre, for, the, concert, hall, szenen, aus, goethes, faust, scenes, from, goethe, s, faust, composed, between, 1844, and, 1853, is, another, hybrid, work, operatic, in, manner, but, written, for, concert, performance, and, labelled, an, oratorio, by, the, composer, the, work, was, never, given, complete, in, schumann, s, lifetime, although, the, third, section, was, successfully, performed, in, dresden, leipzig, and, weimar, in, 1849, to, mark, the, centenary, of, goethe, s, birth, jensen, comments, that, its, good, reception, is, surprising, as, schumann, made, no, concessions, to, popular, taste, the, music, is, not, particularly, tuneful, there, are, no, arias, for, faust, or, gretchen, in, the, grand, manner, the, complete, work, was, first, given, in, 1862, in, cologne, six, years, after, schumann, s, death, schumann, s, other, works, for, voice, and, orchestra, include, a, requiem, mass, described, by, the, critic, ivan, march, as, long, neglected, and, under, prized, like, mozart, before, him, schumann, was, haunted, by, the, conviction, that, the, mass, was, his, own, requiem, all, of, schumann, s, major, works, and, most, of, the, minor, ones, have, been, recorded, from, the, 1920s, his, music, has, had, a, prominent, place, in, the, catalogues, in, the, 1920s, hans, pfitzner, recorded, the, symphonies, and, other,

von, karajan, wolfgang, sawallisch, and, rafael, kubel, k, and, from, the, mid, 1990s, smaller, ensembles, such, as, the, orchestre, des, champs, lys, es, with, philippe, herreweghe, and, the, orchestre, r, volutionnaire, et, romantique, with, john, eliot, gardiner, have, recorded, historically, informed, readings, of, schumann, s, orchestral, music, the, songs, featured, in, the, recorded, repertoire, from, the, early, days, of, the, gramophone, with, performances, by, singers, such, as, elisabeth, schumann, no, relation, to, the, composer, friedrich, schorr, alexander, kipnis, and,

few, of, schumann, s, songs, were, available, on, record, by, the, early, twenty, first, century, every, song, was, on, disc, a, complete, set, was, published, in, 2010, with, the, songs, in,

by, schumann, s, grieg, wrote, that, schumann, s, songs, deserved, to, be, recognised, as, major, contributions, to, world, literature, and, schumann, was, a, major, influence, on, the, russian, school, of, composers, including, anton, rubinstein, and, tchaikovsky, the, latter, though, critical, of, the, orchestration, said, that, schumann, s, symphonic, works, as, well, as, the, chamber, music, and, piano, pieces, revealed, a, whole, new, world, of, musical, forms, although, brahms, said, that, all, he, had, learned, from, schumann, was, how, to, play, chess, other, composers, in,
