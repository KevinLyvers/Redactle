ivan, petrovich, pavlov, russian, ipa, 26, september, 1849, 27, february, 1936, was, a, russian, and, soviet, experimental, neurologist, and, physiologist, known, for, his, discovery, of, classical, conditioning, through, his, experiments, with, dogs, pavlov, was, born, the, first, of, ten, children, in, ryazan, russian, empire, his, father, peter, dmitrievich, pavlov, 1823, 1899, was, a, village, russian, orthodox, priest, his, mother, varvara, ivanovna, uspenskaya, 1826, 1890, was, a, devoted, homemaker, as, a, child, pavlov, willingly, participated, in, house, duties, such, as, doing, the, dishes, and, taking, care, of, his, siblings, he, loved, to, garden, ride, his, bicycle, row, swim, and, play, gorodki, he, devoted, his, summer, vacations, to, these, activities, although, able, to, read, by, the, age, of, seven, pavlov, did, not, begin, formal, schooling, until, he, was, 11, years, old, due, to, serious, injuries, he, had, sustained, when, falling, from, a, high, wall, onto, the, stone, pavement, from, his, childhood, days, pavlov, demonstrated, intellectual, curiosity, along, with, an, unusual, energy, which, he, referred, to, as, the, instinct, for, research, inspired, by, the, progressive, ideas, which, dmitry, pisarev, a, russian, literary, critic, of, the, 1860s, and, ivan, sechenov, the, father, of, russian, physiology, were, spreading, pavlov, abandoned, his, religious, career, and, devoted, his, life, to, science, in, 1870, he, enrolled, in, the, physics, and, mathematics, department, at, the, university, of, saint, petersburg, to, study, natural, science, pavlov, attended, the, ryazan, church, school, before, entering, the, local, theological, seminary, in, 1870, however, he, left, the, seminary, without, graduating, to, attend, the, university, at, st, petersburg, there, he, enrolled, in, the, physics, and, math, department, and, took, natural, science, courses, in, his, fourth, year, his, first, research, project, on, the, physiology, of, the, nerves, of, the, pancreas, won, him, a, prestigious, university, award, in, 1875, pavlov, completed, his, course, with, an, outstanding, record, and, received, the, degree, of, candidate, of, natural, sciences, impelled, by, his, overwhelming, interest, in, physiology, pavlov, decided, to, continue, his, studies, and, proceeded, to, the, imperial, academy, of, medical, surgery, while, at, the, academy, pavlov, became, an, assistant, to, his, former, teacher, elias, von, cyon, he, left, the, department, when, de, cyon, was, replaced, by, another, instructor, after, some, time, pavlov, obtained, a, position, as, a, laboratory, assistant, to, konstantin, nikolaevich, ustimovich, at, the, physiological, department, of, the, veterinary, institute, for, two, years, pavlov, investigated, the, circulatory, system, for, his, medical, dissertation, in, 1878, professor, s, p, botkin, a, famous, russian, clinician, invited, the, gifted, young, physiologist, to, work, in, the, physiological, laboratory, as, the, clinic, s, chief, in, 1879, pavlov, graduated, from, the, medical, military, academy, with, a, gold, medal, award, for, his, research, work, after, a, competitive, examination, pavlov, won, a, fellowship, at, the, academy, for, postgraduate, work, the, fellowship, and, his, position, as, director, of, the, physiological, laboratory, at, botkin, s, clinic, enabled, pavlov, to, continue, his, research, work, in, 1883, he, presented, his, doctor, s, thesis, on, the, subject, of, the, centrifugal, nerves, of, the, heart, and, posited, the, idea, of, nerves, and, the, basic, principles, on, the, trophic, function, of, the, nervous, system, additionally, his, collaboration, with, the, botkin, clinic, produced, evidence, of, a, basic, pattern, in, the, regulation, of, reflexes, in, the, activity, of, circulatory, organs, he, was, inspired, to, pursue, a, scientific, career, by, d, i, pisarev, a, literary, critic, and, natural, science, advocate, of, the, time, and, i, m, sechenov, a, russian, physiologist, whom, pavlov, described, as, the, father, of, physiology, after, completing, his, doctorate, pavlov, went, to, germany, where, he, studied, in, leipzig, with, carl, ludwig, and, eimear, kelly, in, the, heidenhain, laboratories, in, breslau, he, remained, there, from, 1884, to, 1886, heidenhain, was, studying, digestion, in, dogs, using, an, exteriorized, section, of, the, stomach, however, pavlov, perfected, the, technique, by, overcoming, the, problem, of, maintaining, the, external, nerve, supply, the, exteriorized, section, became, known, as, the, heidenhain, or, pavlov, pouch, in, 1886, pavlov, returned, to, russia, to, look, for, a, new, position, his, application, for, the, chair, of, physiology, at, the, university, of, saint, petersburg, was, rejected, eventually, pavlov, was, offered, the, chair, of, pharmacology, at, tomsk, university, in, siberia, and, at, the, university, of, warsaw, in, poland, he, did, not, take, up, either, post, in, 1890, he, was, appointed, the, role, of, professor, of, pharmacology, at, the, military, medical, academy, and, occupied, the, position, for, five, years, in, 1891, pavlov, was, invited, to, the, institute, of, experimental, medicine, in, st, petersburg, to, organize, and, direct, the, department, of, physiology, over, a, 45, year, period, under, his, direction, the, institute, became, one, of, the, most, important, centers, of, physiological, research, in, the, world, pavlov, continued, to, direct, the, department, of, physiology, at, the, institute, while, taking, up, the, chair, of, physiology, at, the, medical, military, academy, in, 1895, pavlov, would, head, the, physiology, department, at, the, academy, continuously, for, three, decades, starting, in, 1901, pavlov, was, nominated, over, four, successive, years, for, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, he, did, not, win, the, prize, until, 1904, because, his, previous, nominations, were, not, specific, to, any, discovery, but, based, on, a, variety, of, laboratory, findings, when, pavlov, received, the, nobel, prize, it, was, specified, that, he, did, so, in, recognition, of, his, work, on, the, physiology, of, digestion, through, which, knowledge, on, vital, aspects, of, the, subject, has, been, transformed, and, enlarged, at, the, institute, of, experimental, medicine, pavlov, carried, out, his, classical, experiments, on, the, digestive, glands, which, would, eventually, grant, him, the, aforementioned, nobel, prize, pavlov, investigated, the, gastric, function, of, dogs, and, later, homeless, children, by, externalizing, a, salivary, gland, so, he, could, collect, measure, and, analyze, the, saliva, and, what, response, it, had, to, food, under, different, conditions, he, noticed, that, the, dogs, tended, to, salivate, before, food, was, actually, delivered, to, their, mouths, and, set, out, to, investigate, this, psychic, secretion, as, he, called, it, experiments, on, orphaned, children, involving, drilling, a, hole, in, their, cheeks, and, applying, electric, shocks, were, continued, by, his, assistant, nikolay, krasnogorsky, pavlov, s, laboratory, housed, a, full, scale, kennel, for, the, experimental, canines, pavlov, was, interested, in, observing, their, long, term, physiological, processes, this, required, keeping, them, alive, and, healthy, to, conduct, chronic, experiments, as, he, called, them, these, were, experiments, over, time, designed, to, understand, the, normal, functions, of, dogs, this, was, a, new, kind, of, study, because, previously, experiments, had, been, acute, meaning, that, the, dog, underwent, vivisection, which, ultimately, killed, it, a, 1921, article, by, sergius, morgulis, in, the, journal, science, was, critical, of, pavlov, s, work, raising, concerns, about, the, environment, in, which, these, experiments, had, been, performed, based, on, a, report, from, h, g, wells, claiming, that, pavlov, grew, potatoes, and, carrots, in, his, laboratory, the, article, stated, it, is, gratifying, to, be, assured, that, professor, pavlov, is, raising, potatoes, only, as, a, pastime, and, still, gives, the, best, of, his, genius, to, scientific, investigation, that, same, year, pavlov, began, holding, laboratory, meetings, known, as, the, wednesday, meetings, at, which, he, spoke, frankly, on, many, topics, including, his, views, on, psychology, these, meetings, lasted, until, he, died, in, 1936, pavlov, was, highly, regarded, by, the, soviet, government, and, he, was, able, to, continue, his, research, until, he, reached, a, considerable, age, he, was, praised, by, lenin, despite, praise, from, the, soviet, union, government, the, money, that, poured, in, to, support, his, laboratory, and, the, honours, he, was, given, pavlov, made, no, attempts, to, conceal, the, disapproval, and, contempt, with, which, he, regarded, soviet, communism, in, 1923, he, stated, that, he, would, not, sacrifice, even, the, hind, leg, of, a, frog, to, the, type, of, social, experiment, that, the, regime, was, conducting, in, russia, four, years, later, he, wrote, to, stalin, protesting, at, what, was, being, done, to, russian, intellectuals, and, saying, he, was, ashamed, to, be, a, russian, after, the, murder, of, sergei, kirov, in, 1934, pavlov, wrote, several, letters, to, molotov, criticizing, the, mass, persecutions, which, followed, and, asking, for, the, reconsideration, of, cases, pertaining, to, several, people, he, knew, personally, conscious, until, his, final, moment, pavlov, asked, one, of, his, students, to, sit, beside, his, bed, and, to, record, the, circumstances, of, his, dying, he, wanted, to, create, unique, evidence, of, subjective, experiences, of, this, terminal, phase, of, life, pavlov, died, of, double, pneumonia, at, the, age, of, 86, he, was, given, a, grand, funeral, and, his, study, and, laboratory, were, preserved, as, a, museum, in, his, honour, his, grave, is, in, the, literatorskie, mostki, writers, footways, section, of, volkovo, cemetery, in, st, petersburg, pavlov, contributed, to, many, areas, of, physiology, and, neurological, sciences, most, of, his, work, involved, research, in, temperament, conditioning, and, involuntary, reflex, actions, pavlov, performed, and, directed, experiments, on, digestion, eventually, publishing, the, work, of, the, digestive, glands, in, 1897, after, 12, years, of, research, his, experiments, earned, him, the, 1904, nobel, prize, in, physiology, and, medicine, these, experiments, included, surgically, extracting, portions, of, the, digestive, system, from, nonhuman, animals, severing, nerve, bundles, to, determine, the, effects, and, implanting, fistulas, between, digestive, organs, and, an, external, pouch, to, examine, the, organ, s, contents, this, research, served, as, a, base, for, broad, research, on, the, digestive, system, further, work, on, reflex, actions, involved, involuntary, reactions, to, stress, and, pain, pavlov, was, always, interested, in, biomarkers, of, temperament, types, described, by, hippocrates, and, galen, he, called, these, biomarkers, properties, of, nervous, systems, and, identified, three, main, properties, 1, strength, 2, mobility, of, nervous, processes, and, 3, a, balance, between, excitation, and, inhibition, and, derived, four, types, based, on, these, three, properties, he, extended, the, definitions, of, the, four, temperament, types, under, study, at, the, time, choleric, phlegmatic, sanguine, and, melancholic, updating, the, names, to, the, strong, and, impetuous, type, the, strong, equilibrated, and, quiet, type, the, strong, equilibrated, and, lively, type, and, the, weak, type, respectively, pavlov, and, his, researchers, observed, and, began, the, study, of, transmarginal, inhibition, tmi, the, body, s, natural, response, of, shutting, down, when, exposed, to, overwhelming, stress, or, pain, by, electric, shock, this, research, showed, how, all, temperament, types, responded, to, the, stimuli, the, same, way, but, different, temperaments, move, through, the, responses, at, different, times, he, commented, that, the, most, basic, inherited, difference, was, how, soon, they, reached, this, shutdown, point, and, that, the, quick, to, shut, down, have, a, fundamentally, different, type, of, nervous, system, pavlov, carried, out, experiments, on, the, digestive, glands, as, well, as, investigated, the, gastric, function, of, dogs, and, eventually, won, the, nobel, prize, for, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1904, becoming, the, first, russian, nobel, laureate, a, survey, in, the, review, of, general, psychology, published, in, 2002, ranked, pavlov, as, the, 24th, most, cited, psychologist, of, the, 20th, century, pavlov, s, principles, of, classical, conditioning, have, been, found, to, operate, across, a, variety, of, behavior, therapies, and, in, experimental, and, clinical, settings, such, as, educational, classrooms, and, even, reducing, phobias, with, systematic, desensitization, the, basics, of, pavlov, s, classical, conditioning, serve, as, a, historical, backdrop, for, current, learning, theories, however, the, russian, physiologist, s, initial, interest, in, classical, conditioning, occurred, almost, by, accident, during, one, of, his, experiments, on, digestion, in, dogs, considering, that, pavlov, worked, closely, with, nonhuman, animals, throughout, many, of, his, experiments, his, early, contributions, were, primarily, about, learning, in, nonhuman, animals, however, the, fundamentals, of, classical, conditioning, have, been, examined, across, many, different, organisms, including, humans, the, basic, underlying, principles, of, pavlov, s, classical, conditioning, have, extended, to, a, variety, of, settings, such, as, classrooms, and, learning, environments, classical, conditioning, focuses, on, using, preceding, conditions, to, alter, behavioral, reactions, the, principles, underlying, classical, conditioning, have, influenced, preventative, antecedent, control, strategies, used, in, the, classroom, classical, conditioning, set, the, groundwork, for, the, present, day, behavior, modification, practices, such, as, antecedent, control, antecedent, events, and, conditions, are, defined, as, those, conditions, occurring, before, the, behavior, pavlov, s, early, experiments, used, manipulation, of, events, or, stimuli, preceding, behavior, i, e, a, tone, to, produce, salivation, in, dogs, much, like, teachers, manipulate, instruction, and, learning, environments, to, produce, positive, behaviors, or, decrease, maladaptive, behaviors, although, he, did, not, refer, to, the, tone, as, an, antecedent, pavlov, was, one, of, the, first, scientists, to, demonstrate, the, relationship, between, environmental, stimuli, and, behavioral, responses, pavlov, systematically, presented, and, withdrew, stimuli, to, determine, the, antecedents, that, were, eliciting, responses, which, is, similar, to, the, ways, in, which, educational, professionals, conduct, functional, behavior, assessments, antecedent, strategies, are, supported, by, empirical, evidence, to, operate, implicitly, within, classroom, environments, antecedent, based, interventions, are, supported, by, research, to, be, preventative, and, to, produce, immediate, reductions, in, problem, behaviors, pavlov, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1904, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1907, elected, an, international, member, of, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1908, was, awarded, the, royal, society, s, copley, medal, in, 1915, and, elected, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1932, he, became, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1907, pavlov, s, dog, the, pavlovian, session, and, pavlov, s, typology, are, named, in, his, honour, the, asteroid, 1007, pawlowia, and, the, lunar, crater, pavlov, were, also, named, after, him, the, concept, for, which, pavlov, is, best, known, is, the, conditioned, reflex, or, what, he, called, the, conditional, reflex, which, he, developed, jointly, with, his, assistant, ivan, tolochinov, in, 1901, edwin, b, twitmyer, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, in, philadelphia, published, similar, research, in, 1902, a, year, before, pavlov, published, his, the, concept, was, developed, after, observing, the, rates, of, salivation, in, dogs, pavlov, noticed, that, his, dogs, began, to, salivate, in, the, presence, of, the, technician, who, normally, fed, them, rather, than, simply, salivating, in, the, presence, of, the, food, if, a, buzzer, or, metronome, was, sounded, before, the, food, was, given, the, dog, would, later, come, to, associate, the, sound, with, the, presentation, of, the, food, and, salivate, upon, the, presentation, of, the, sound, stimulus, alone, tolochinov, whose, own, term, for, the, phenomenon, had, been, reflex, at, a, distance, communicated, the, results, at, the, congress, of, natural, sciences, in, helsinki, in, 1903, later, the, same, year, pavlov, more, fully, explained, the, findings, at, the, 14th, international, medical, congress, in, madrid, where, he, read, a, paper, titled, the, experimental, psychology, and, psychopathology, of, animals, as, pavlov, s, work, became, known, in, the, west, particularly, through, the, writings, of, john, b, watson, and, b, f, skinner, the, idea, of, conditioning, as, an, automatic, form, of, learning, became, a, key, concept, in, the, developing, specialism, of, comparative, psychology, and, the, general, approach, to, psychology, that, underlay, it, behaviorism, pavlov, s, work, with, classical, conditioning, was, of, huge, influence, on, how, humans, perceived, themselves, their, behavior, and, learning, processes, his, studies, of, classical, conditioning, continue, to, be, central, to, modern, behavior, therapy, the, pavlov, institute, of, physiology, of, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, was, founded, by, pavlov, in, 1925, and, named, after, him, following, his, death, british, philosopher, bertrand, russell, observed, that, hether, pavlov, s, methods, can, be, made, to, cover, the, whole, of, human, behaviour, is, open, to, question, but, at, any, rate, they, cover, a, very, large, field, and, within, this, field, they, have, shown, how, to, apply, scientific, methods, with, quantitative, exactitude, pavlov, s, research, on, conditional, reflexes, greatly, influenced, not, only, science, but, also, popular, culture, pavlovian, conditioning, is, a, major, theme, in, aldous, huxley, s, dystopian, novel, brave, new, world, 1932, and, in, thomas, pynchon, s, gravity, s, rainbow, 1973, it, is, popularly, believed, that, pavlov, always, signalled, the, occurrence, of, food, by, ringing, a, bell, however, his, writings, record, the, use, of, a, wide, variety, of, stimuli, including, electric, shocks, whistles, metronomes, tuning, forks, and, a, range, of, visual, stimuli, in, addition, to, the, ring, of, a, bell, in, 1994, a, charles, catania, cast, doubt, on, whether, pavlov, ever, actually, used, a, bell, in, his, experiments, littman, tentatively, attributed, the, popular, imagery, to, pavlov, s, contemporaries, vladimir, mikhailovich, bekhterev, and, john, b, watson, roger, k, thomas, of, the, university, of, georgia, however, said, they, had, found, three, additional, references, to, pavlov, s, use, of, a, bell, that, strongly, challenge, littman, s, argument, in, reply, littman, suggested, that, catania, s, recollection, that, pavlov, did, not, use, a, bell, in, research, was, convincing, and, correct, in, 1964, the, psychologist, hans, eysenck, reviewed, pavlov, s, lectures, on, conditioned, reflexes, for, the, bmj, volume, i, twenty, five, years, of, objective, study, of, the, higher, nervous, activity, of, animals, volume, ii, conditioned, reflexes, and, psychiatry, pavlov, married, seraphima, vasilievna, karchevskaya, on, 1, may, 1881, seraphima, called, sara, for, short, was, born, in, 1855, they, had, met, in, 1878, or, 1879, when, she, went, to, st, petersburg, to, study, at, the, pedagogical, institute, in, her, later, years, she, suffered, from, ill, health, and, died, in, 1947, the, first, nine, years, of, their, marriage, were, marred, by, financial, problems, pavlov, and, his, wife, often, had, to, stay, with, others, to, have, a, home, and, for, a, time, the, two, lived, apart, so, that, they, could, find, hospitality, although, their, poverty, caused, despair, material, welfare, was, a, secondary, consideration, sara, s, first, pregnancy, ended, in, a, miscarriage, when, she, conceived, again, the, couple, took, precautions, and, she, safely, gave, birth, to, their, first, child, a, boy, whom, they, named, mirchik, sara, became, deeply, depressed, following, mirchik, s, sudden, death, in, childhood, pavlov, and, his, wife, eventually, had, four, more, children, vladimir, victor, vsevolod, and, vera, their, youngest, son, vsevolod, died, of, pancreatic, cancer, in, 1935, only, one, year, before, his, father, pavlov, was, an, atheist, pavlov, s, follower, e, m, kreps, asked, him, whether, he, was, religious, kreps, writes, that, pavlov, smiled, and, replied, listen, good, fellow, in, regard, to, my, religiosity, my, belief, in, god, my, church, attendance, there, is, no, truth, in, it, it, is, sheer, fantasy, i, was, a, seminarian, and, like, the, majority, of, seminarians, i, became, an, unbeliever, an, atheist, in, my, school, years
