aaron, copland, k, o, p, l, n, d, kohp, l, nd, november, 14, 1900, december, 2, 1990, was, an, american, composer, critic, writer, teacher, pianist, and, later, a, conductor, of, his, own, and, other, american, music, copland, was, referred, to, by, his, peers, and, critics, as, the, dean, of, american, composers, the, open, slowly, changing, harmonies, in, much, of, his, music, are, typical, of, what, many, people, consider, to, be, the, sound, of, american, music, evoking, the, vast, american, landscape, and, pioneer, spirit, he, is, best, known, for, the, works, he, wrote, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, in, a, deliberately, accessible, style, often, referred, to, as, populist, and, which, the, composer, labeled, his, vernacular, style, works, in, this, vein, include, the, ballets, appalachian, spring, billy, the, kid, and, rodeo, his, fanfare, for, the, common, man, and, third, symphony, in, addition, to, his, ballets, and, orchestral, works, he, produced, music, in, many, other, genres, including, chamber, music, vocal, works, opera, and, film, scores, after, some, initial, studies, with, composer, rubin, goldmark, copland, traveled, to, paris, where, he, first, studied, with, isidor, philipp, and, paul, vidal, then, with, noted, pedagogue, nadia, boulanger, he, studied, three, years, with, boulanger, whose, eclectic, approach, to, music, inspired, his, own, broad, taste, determined, upon, his, return, to, the, u, s, to, make, his, way, as, a, full, time, composer, copland, gave, lecture, recitals, wrote, works, on, commission, and, did, some, teaching, and, writing, however, he, found, that, composing, orchestral, music, in, the, modernist, style, which, he, had, adopted, while, studying, abroad, was, a, financially, contradictory, approach, particularly, in, light, of, the, great, depression, he, shifted, in, the, mid, 1930s, to, a, more, accessible, musical, style, which, mirrored, the, german, idea, of, gebrauchsmusik, music, for, use, music, that, could, serve, utilitarian, and, artistic, purposes, during, the, depression, years, he, traveled, extensively, to, europe, africa, and, mexico, formed, an, important, friendship, with, mexican, composer, carlos, ch, vez, and, began, composing, his, signature, works, during, the, late, 1940s, copland, became, aware, that, stravinsky, and, other, fellow, composers, had, begun, to, study, arnold, schoenberg, s, use, of, twelve, tone, serial, techniques, after, he, had, been, exposed, to, the, works, of, french, composer, pierre, boulez, he, incorporated, serial, techniques, into, his, piano, quartet, 1950, piano, fantasy, 1957, connotations, for, orchestra, 1961, and, inscape, for, orchestra, 1967, unlike, schoenberg, copland, used, his, tone, rows, in, much, the, same, fashion, as, his, tonal, material, as, sources, for, melodies, and, harmonies, rather, than, as, complete, statements, in, their, own, right, except, for, crucial, events, from, a, structural, point, of, view, from, the, 1960s, onward, copland, s, activities, turned, more, from, composing, to, conducting, he, became, a, frequent, guest, conductor, of, orchestras, in, the, u, s, and, the, uk, and, made, a, series, of, recordings, of, his, music, primarily, for, columbia, records, aaron, copland, was, born, in, brooklyn, new, york, on, november, 14, 1900, he, was, the, youngest, of, five, children, in, a, conservative, jewish, immigrant, family, of, lithuanian, origins, while, emigrating, from, russia, to, the, united, states, copland, s, father, harris, morris, copland, lived, and, worked, in, scotland, for, two, to, three, years, to, pay, for, his, boat, fare, to, the, united, states, it, was, there, that, copland, s, father, may, have, anglicized, his, surname, kaplan, to, copland, though, copland, himself, believed, for, many, years, that, the, change, had, been, caused, by, an, ellis, island, immigration, official, when, his, father, entered, the, country, copland, was, however, unaware, until, late, in, his, life, that, the, family, name, had, been, kaplan, and, his, parents, never, told, him, this, throughout, his, childhood, copland, and, his, family, lived, above, his, parents, brooklyn, shop, h, m, copland, s, at, 628, washington, avenue, which, aaron, would, later, describe, as, a, kind, of, neighborhood, macy, s, on, the, corner, of, dean, street, and, washington, avenue, and, most, of, the, children, helped, out, in, the, store, his, father, was, a, staunch, democrat, the, family, members, were, active, in, congregation, baith, israel, anshei, emes, where, aaron, celebrated, his, bar, mitzvah, not, especially, athletic, the, sensitive, young, man, became, an, avid, reader, and, often, read, horatio, alger, stories, on, his, front, steps, copland, s, father, had, no, musical, interest, his, mother, sarah, mittenthal, copland, sang, played, the, piano, and, arranged, for, music, lessons, for, her, children, copland, had, four, older, siblings, two, older, brothers, ralph, and, leon, and, two, older, sisters, laurine, and, josephine, of, his, siblings, his, oldest, brother, ralph, was, the, most, advanced, musically, he, was, proficient, on, the, violin, his, sister, laurine, had, the, strongest, connection, with, aaron, she, gave, him, his, first, piano, lessons, promoted, his, musical, education, and, supported, him, in, his, musical, career, a, student, at, the, metropolitan, opera, school, and, a, frequent, opera, goer, laurine, also, brought, home, libretti, for, aaron, to, study, copland, attended, boys, high, school, and, in, the, summer, went, to, various, camps, most, of, his, early, exposure, to, music, was, at, jewish, weddings, and, ceremonies, and, occasional, family, musicales, copland, began, writing, songs, at, the, age, of, eight, and, a, half, his, earliest, notated, music, about, seven, bars, he, wrote, when, age, 11, was, for, an, opera, scenario, he, created, and, called, zenatello, from, 1913, to, 1917, he, took, piano, lessons, with, leopold, wolfsohn, who, taught, him, the, standard, classical, fare, copland, s, first, public, music, performance, was, at, a, wanamaker, s, recital, by, the, age, of, 15, after, attending, a, concert, by, polish, composer, pianist, ignacy, jan, paderewski, copland, decided, to, become, a, composer, at, age, 16, copland, heard, his, first, symphony, at, the, brooklyn, academy, of, music, after, attempts, to, further, his, music, study, from, a, correspondence, course, copland, took, formal, lessons, in, harmony, theory, and, composition, from, rubin, goldmark, a, noted, teacher, and, composer, of, american, music, who, had, given, george, gershwin, three, lessons, goldmark, with, whom, copland, studied, between, 1917, and, 1921, gave, the, young, copland, a, solid, foundation, especially, in, the, germanic, tradition, as, copland, stated, later, this, was, a, stroke, of, luck, for, me, i, was, spared, the, floundering, that, so, many, musicians, have, suffered, through, incompetent, teaching, but, copland, also, commented, that, the, maestro, had, little, sympathy, for, the, advanced, musical, idioms, of, the, day, and, his, approved, composers, ended, with, richard, strauss, copland, s, graduation, piece, from, his, studies, with, goldmark, was, a, three, movement, piano, sonata, in, a, romantic, style, but, he, had, also, composed, more, original, and, daring, pieces, which, he, did, not, share, with, his, teacher, in, addition, to, regularly, attending, the, metropolitan, opera, and, the, new, york, symphony, where, he, heard, the, standard, classical, repertory, copland, continued, his, musical, development, through, an, expanding, circle, of, musical, friends, after, graduating, from, high, school, copland, played, in, dance, bands, continuing, his, musical, education, he, received, further, piano, lessons, from, victor, wittgenstein, who, found, his, student, to, be, quiet, shy, well, mannered, and, gracious, in, accepting, criticism, copland, s, fascination, with, the, russian, revolution, and, its, promise, for, freeing, the, lower, classes, drew, a, rebuke, from, his, father, and, uncles, in, spite, of, that, in, his, early, adult, life, copland, would, develop, friendships, with, people, who, had, socialist, and, communist, leanings, copland, s, passion, for, the, latest, european, music, plus, glowing, letters, from, his, friend, aaron, schaffer, inspired, him, to, go, to, paris, for, further, study, an, article, in, musical, america, about, a, summer, school, program, for, american, musicians, at, the, fontainebleau, school, of, music, offered, by, the, french, government, encouraged, copland, still, further, his, father, wanted, him, to, go, to, college, but, his, mother, s, vote, in, the, family, conference, allowed, him, to, give, paris, a, try, on, arriving, in, france, he, studied, at, fontainebleau, with, pianist, and, pedagog, isidor, philipp, and, composer, paul, vidal, when, copland, found, vidal, too, much, like, goldmark, he, switched, at, the, suggestion, of, a, fellow, student, to, nadia, boulanger, then, aged, 34, he, had, initial, reservations, no, one, to, my, knowledge, had, ever, before, thought, of, studying, with, a, woman, she, interviewed, him, and, recalled, later, one, could, tell, his, talent, immediately, boulanger, had, as, many, as, 40, students, at, once, and, employed, a, formal, regimen, that, copland, had, to, follow, copland, found, her, incisive, mind, much, to, his, liking, and, found, her, ability, to, critique, a, composition, impeccable, boulanger, could, always, find, the, weak, spot, in, a, place, you, suspected, was, weak, she, also, could, tell, you, why, it, was, weak, he, wrote, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, ralph, this, intellectual, amazon, is, not, only, professor, at, the, conservatoire, is, not, only, familiar, with, all, music, from, bach, to, stravinsky, but, is, prepared, for, anything, worse, in, the, way, of, dissonance, but, make, no, mistake, a, more, charming, womanly, woman, never, lived, copland, later, wrote, that, it, was, wonderful, for, me, to, find, a, teacher, with, such, openness, of, mind, while, at, the, same, time, she, held, firm, ideas, of, right, and, wrong, in, musical, matters, the, confidence, she, had, in, my, talents, and, her, belief, in, me, were, at, the, very, least, flattering, and, more, they, were, crucial, to, my, development, at, this, time, of, my, career, though, he, had, planned, on, only, one, year, abroad, he, studied, with, her, for, three, years, finding, that, her, eclectic, approach, inspired, his, own, broad, musical, taste, along, with, his, studies, with, boulanger, copland, took, classes, in, french, language, and, history, at, the, sorbonne, attended, plays, and, frequented, shakespeare, and, company, the, english, language, bookstore, that, was, a, gathering, place, for, expatriate, american, writers, among, this, group, in, the, heady, cultural, atmosphere, of, paris, in, the, 1920s, were, paul, bowles, ernest, hemingway, sinclair, lewis, gertrude, stein, and, ezra, pound, as, well, as, artists, like, pablo, picasso, marc, chagall, and, amedeo, modigliani, also, influential, on, the, new, music, were, the, french, intellectuals, marcel, proust, paul, val, ry, jean, paul, sartre, and, andr, gide, the, latter, cited, by, copland, as, being, his, personal, favorite, and, most, read, travels, to, italy, austria, and, germany, rounded, out, copland, s, musical, education, during, his, stay, in, paris, copland, began, writing, musical, critiques, the, first, on, gabriel, faur, which, helped, spread, his, fame, and, stature, in, the, music, community, after, a, fruitful, stay, in, paris, copland, returned, to, america, optimistic, and, enthusiastic, about, the, future, determined, to, make, his, way, as, a, full, time, composer, he, rented, a, studio, apartment, on, new, york, city, s, upper, west, side, in, the, empire, hotel, close, to, carnegie, hall, and, other, musical, venues, and, publishers, he, remained, in, that, area, for, the, next, 30, years, later, moving, to, westchester, county, new, york, copland, lived, frugally, and, survived, financially, with, help, from, two, 2, 500, guggenheim, fellowships, in, 1925, and, 1926, each, of, the, two, equivalent, to, 43, 435, in, 2023, lecture, recitals, awards, appointments, and, small, commissions, plus, some, teaching, writing, and, personal, loans, kept, him, afloat, in, the, subsequent, years, through, world, war, ii, also, important, especially, during, the, depression, were, wealthy, patrons, who, underwrote, performances, helped, pay, for, publication, of, works, and, promoted, musical, events, and, composers, among, those, mentors, was, serge, koussevitzky, the, music, director, of, the, boston, symphony, orchestra, and, known, as, a, champion, of, new, music, koussevitsky, would, prove, to, be, very, influential, in, copland, s, life, and, was, perhaps, the, second, most, important, figure, in, copland, s, career, after, boulanger, beginning, with, the, symphony, for, organ, and, orchestra, 1924, koussevitzky, would, perform, more, of, copland, s, music, than, that, of, any, the, composer, s, contemporaries, at, a, time, when, other, conductors, were, programming, only, a, few, of, copland, s, works, soon, after, his, return, to, the, united, states, copland, was, exposed, to, the, artistic, circle, of, photographer, alfred, stieglitz, while, copland, did, not, care, for, stieglitz, s, domineering, attitude, he, did, admire, his, work, and, took, to, heart, stieglitz, s, conviction, that, american, artists, should, reflect, the, ideas, of, american, democracy, this, ideal, influenced, not, just, the, composer, but, also, a, generation, of, artists, and, photographers, including, paul, strand, edward, weston, ansel, adams, georgia, o, keeffe, and, walker, evans, evans, s, photographs, inspired, portions, of, copland, s, opera, the, tender, land, in, his, quest, to, take, up, the, slogan, of, the, stieglitz, group, affirm, america, copland, found, only, the, music, of, carl, ruggles, and, charles, ives, upon, which, to, draw, without, what, copland, called, a, usable, past, in, american, classical, composers, he, looked, toward, jazz, and, popular, music, something, he, had, already, started, to, do, while, in, europe, in, the, 1920s, gershwin, bessie, smith, and, louis, armstrong, were, in, the, forefront, of, american, popular, music, and, jazz, by, the, end, of, the, decade, copland, felt, his, music, was, going, in, a, more, abstract, less, jazz, oriented, direction, however, as, large, swing, bands, such, as, those, of, benny, goodman, and, glenn, miller, became, popular, in, the, 1930s, copland, took, a, renewed, interest, in, the, genre, inspired, by, the, example, of, les, six, in, france, copland, sought, out, contemporaries, such, as, roger, sessions, roy, harris, virgil, thomson, and, walter, piston, and, quickly, established, himself, as, a, spokesperson, for, composers, of, his, generation, he, also, helped, found, the, copland, sessions, concerts, to, showcase, these, composers, chamber, works, to, new, audiences, copland, s, relationship, with, these, men, who, became, known, as, commando, unit, was, one, of, both, support, and, rivalry, and, he, played, a, key, role, in, keeping, them, together, until, after, world, war, ii, he, also, was, generous, with, his, time, with, nearly, every, american, young, composer, he, met, during, his, life, later, earning, the, title, dean, of, american, music, with, the, knowledge, he, had, gained, from, his, studies, in, paris, copland, came, into, demand, as, a, lecturer, and, writer, on, contemporary, european, classical, music, from, 1927, to, 1930, and, from, 1935, to, 1938, he, taught, classes, at, the, new, school, for, social, research, in, new, york, city, eventually, his, new, school, lectures, would, appear, in, the, form, of, two, books, what, to, listen, for, in, music, 1937, revised, 1957, and, our, new, music, 1940, revised, 1968, and, retitled, the, new, music, 1900, 1960, during, this, period, copland, also, wrote, regularly, for, the, new, york, times, the, musical, quarterly, and, a, number, of, other, journals, these, articles, would, appear, in, 1969, as, the, book, copland, on, music, during, his, time, at, the, new, school, copland, was, active, as, a, presenter, and, curator, using, the, new, school, as, a, key, location, to, present, a, wide, range, of, composers, and, artists, from, the, united, states, as, well, as, across, the, globe, copland, s, compositions, in, the, early, 1920s, reflected, the, modernist, attitude, that, prevailed, among, intellectuals, that, the, arts, need, be, accessible, to, only, a, cadre, of, the, enlightened, and, that, the, masses, would, come, to, appreciate, their, efforts, over, time, however, mounting, troubles, with, the, symphonic, ode, 1929, and, short, symphony, 1933, caused, copland, to, rethink, this, approach, it, was, financially, contradictory, particularly, during, the, depression, avant, garde, music, had, lost, what, cultural, historian, morris, dickstein, calls, its, buoyant, experimental, edge, and, the, national, mood, toward, it, had, changed, as, biographer, howard, pollack, points, out, copland, observed, two, trends, among, composers, in, the, 1930s, first, a, continuing, attempt, to, simplify, their, musical, language, and, second, a, desire, to, make, contact, with, as, wide, an, audience, as, possible, since, 1927, he, had, been, in, the, process, of, simplifying, or, at, least, paring, down, his, musical, language, though, in, such, a, manner, as, to, sometimes, have, the, effect, paradoxically, of, estranging, audiences, and, performers, by, 1933, he, began, to, find, ways, to, make, his, starkly, personal, language, accessible, to, a, surprisingly, large, number, of, people, in, many, ways, this, shift, mirrored, the, german, idea, of, gebrauchsmusik, music, for, use, as, composers, sought, to, create, music, that, could, serve, a, utilitarian, as, well, as, artistic, purpose, this, approach, encompassed, two, trends, first, music, that, students, could, easily, learn, and, second, music, which, would, have, wider, appeal, such, as, incidental, music, for, plays, movies, radio, etc, toward, this, end, copland, provided, musical, advice, and, inspiration, to, the, group, theatre, a, company, which, also, attracted, stella, adler, elia, kazan, and, lee, strasberg, philosophically, an, outgrowth, of, stieglitz, and, his, ideals, the, group, focused, on, socially, relevant, plays, by, the, american, authors, through, it, and, later, his, work, in, film, copland, met, several, major, american, playwrights, including, thornton, wilder, william, inge, arthur, miller, and, edward, albee, and, considered, projects, with, all, of, them, around, 1935, copland, began, to, compose, musical, pieces, for, young, audiences, in, accordance, with, the, first, goal, of, american, gebrauchsmusik, these, works, included, piano, pieces, the, young, pioneers, and, an, opera, the, second, hurricane, during, the, depression, years, copland, traveled, extensively, to, europe, africa, and, mexico, he, formed, an, important, friendship, with, mexican, composer, carlos, ch, vez, and, would, return, often, to, mexico, for, working, vacations, conducting, engagements, during, his, initial, visit, to, mexico, copland, began, composing, the, first, of, his, signature, works, el, sal, n, m, xico, which, he, completed, in, 1936, in, it, and, in, the, second, hurricane, copland, began, experimenting, as, he, phrased, it, with, a, simpler, more, accessible, style, this, and, other, incidental, commissions, fulfilled, the, second, goal, of, american, gebrauchsmusik, creating, music, of, wide, appeal, concurrent, with, the, second, hurricane, copland, composed, for, radio, broadcast, prairie, journal, on, a, commission, from, the, columbia, broadcast, system, this, was, one, of, his, first, pieces, to, convey, the, landscape, of, the, american, west, this, emphasis, on, the, frontier, carried, over, to, his, ballet, billy, the, kid, 1938, which, along, with, el, sal, n, m, xico, became, his, first, widespread, public, success, copland, s, ballet, music, established, him, as, an, authentic, composer, of, american, music, much, as, stravinsky, s, ballet, scores, connected, the, composer, with, russian, music, and, came, at, an, opportune, time, he, helped, fill, a, vacuum, for, american, choreographers, to, fill, their, dance, repertory, and, tapped, into, an, artistic, groundswell, from, the, motion, pictures, of, busby, berkeley, and, fred, astaire, to, the, ballets, of, george, balanchine, and, martha, graham, to, both, democratize, and, americanize, dance, as, an, art, form, in, 1938, copland, helped, form, the, american, composers, alliance, to, promote, and, publish, american, contemporary, classical, music, copland, was, president, of, the, organization, from, 1939, to, 1945, in, 1939, copland, completed, his, first, two, hollywood, film, scores, for, of, mice, and, men, and, our, town, and, composed, the, radio, score, john, henry, based, on, the, folk, ballad, while, these, works, and, others, like, them, that, would, follow, were, accepted, by, the, listening, public, at, large, detractors, accused, copland, of, pandering, to, the, masses, music, critic, paul, rosenfeld, for, one, warned, in, 1939, that, copland, was, standing, in, the, fork, in, the, high, road, the, two, branches, of, which, lead, respectively, to, popular, and, artistic, success, even, some, of, the, composer, s, friends, such, as, composer, arthur, berger, were, confused, about, copland, s, simpler, style, one, composer, david, diamond, went, so, far, as, to, lecture, copland, by, having, sold, out, to, the, mongrel, commercialists, half, way, already, the, danger, is, going, to, be, wider, for, you, and, i, beg, you, dear, aaron, don, t, sell, out, yet, copland, s, response, was, that, his, writing, as, he, did, and, in, as, many, genres, was, his, response, to, how, the, depression, had, affected, society, as, well, as, to, new, media, and, the, audiences, made, available, by, these, new, media, as, he, himself, phrased, it, the, composer, who, is, frightened, of, losing, his, artistic, integrity, through, contact, with, a, mass, audience, is, no, longer, aware, of, the, meaning, of, the, word, art, the, 1940s, were, arguably, copland, s, most, productive, years, and, some, of, his, works, from, this, period, would, cement, his, worldwide, fame, his, ballet, scores, for, rodeo, 1942, and, appalachian, spring, 1944, were, huge, successes, his, pieces, lincoln, portrait, and, fanfare, for, the, common, man, became, patriotic, standards, also, important, was, the, third, symphony, composed, in, a, two, year, period, from, 1944, to, 1946, it, became, copland, s, best, known, symphony, the, clarinet, concerto, 1948, scored, for, solo, clarinet, strings, harp, and, piano, was, a, commission, piece, for, band, leader, and, clarinetist, benny, goodman, and, a, complement, to, copland, s, earlier, jazz, influenced, work, the, piano, concerto, 1926, his, four, piano, blues, is, an, introspective, composition, with, a, jazz, influence, copland, finished, the, 1940s, with, two, film, scores, one, for, william, wyler, s, the, heiress, and, one, for, the, film, adaptation, of, john, steinbeck, s, novel, the, red, pony, in, 1949, copland, returned, to, europe, where, he, found, french, composer, pierre, boulez, dominating, the, group, of, post, war, avant, garde, composers, there, he, also, met, with, proponents, of, twelve, tone, technique, based, on, the, works, of, arnold, schoenberg, and, found, himself, interested, in, adapting, serial, methods, to, his, own, musical, voice, in, 1950, copland, received, a, u, s, italy, fulbright, commission, scholarship, to, study, in, rome, which, he, did, the, following, year, around, this, time, he, also, composed, his, piano, quartet, adopting, schoenberg, s, twelve, tone, method, of, composition, and, old, american, songs, 1950, the, first, set, of, which, was, premiered, by, peter, pears, and, benjamin, britten, the, second, by, william, warfield, during, the, 1951, 52, academic, year, copland, gave, a, series, of, lectures, under, the, charles, eliot, norton, professorship, at, harvard, university, these, lectures, were, published, as, the, book, music, and, imagination, because, of, his, leftist, views, which, had, included, his, support, of, the, communist, party, usa, ticket, during, the, 1936, presidential, election, and, his, strong, support, of, progressive, party, candidate, henry, a, wallace, during, the, 1948, presidential, election, copland, was, investigated, by, the, fbi, during, the, red, scare, of, the, 1950s, he, was, included, on, an, fbi, list, of, 151, artists, thought, to, have, communist, associations, and, found, himself, blacklisted, with, a, lincoln, portrait, withdrawn, from, the, 1953, inaugural, concert, for, president, eisenhower, called, later, that, year, to, a, private, hearing, at, the, united, states, capitol, in, washington, d, c, copland, was, questioned, by, joseph, mccarthy, and, roy, cohn, about, his, lecturing, abroad, and, his, affiliations, with, various, organizations, and, events, in, the, process, mccarthy, and, cohn, neglected, completely, copland, s, works, which, made, a, virtue, of, american, values, outraged, by, the, accusations, many, members, of, the, musical, community, held, up, copland, s, music, as, a, banner, of, his, patriotism, the, investigations, ceased, in, 1955, and, were, closed, in, 1975, the, mccarthy, probes, did, not, seriously, affect, copland, s, career, and, international, artistic, reputation, however, taxing, as, they, might, have, been, on, his, time, energy, and, emotional, state, nevertheless, beginning, in, 1950, copland, who, had, been, appalled, at, stalin, s, persecution, of, shostakovich, and, other, artists, began, resigning, from, participation, in, leftist, groups, copland, pollack, states, stayed, particularly, concerned, about, the, role, of, the, artist, in, society, he, decried, the, lack, of, artistic, freedom, in, the, soviet, union, and, in, his, 1954, norton, lecture, he, asserted, that, loss, of, freedom, under, soviet, communism, deprived, artists, of, the, immemorial, right, of, the, artist, to, be, wrong, he, began, to, vote, democratic, first, for, stevenson, and, then, for, kennedy, potentially, more, damaging, for, copland, was, a, sea, change, in, artistic, tastes, away, from, the, populist, mores, that, infused, his, work, of, the, 1930s, and, 40s, beginning, in, the, 1940s, intellectuals, assailed, popular, front, culture, to, which, copland, s, music, was, linked, and, labeled, it, in, dickstein, s, words, as, hopelessly, middlebrow, a, dumbing, down, of, art, into, toothless, entertainment, they, often, linked, their, disdain, for, populist, art, with, technology, new, media, and, mass, audiences, in, other, words, the, areas, of, radio, television, and, motion, pictures, for, which, copland, either, had, or, soon, would, write, music, as, well, as, his, popular, ballets, while, these, attacks, actually, began, at, the, end, of, the, 1930s, with, the, writings, of, clement, greenberg, and, dwight, macdonald, for, partisan, review, they, were, based, in, anti, stalinist, politics, and, would, accelerate, in, the, decades, following, world, war, ii, despite, any, difficulties, that, his, suspected, communist, sympathies, might, have, posed, copland, traveled, extensively, during, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, to, observe, the, avant, garde, styles, of, europe, hear, compositions, by, soviet, composers, not, well, known, in, the, west, and, experience, the, new, school, of, polish, music, while, in, japan, he, was, taken, with, the, work, of, t, ru, takemitsu, and, began, a, correspondence, with, him, that, would, last, over, the, next, decade, copland, revised, his, text, the, new, music, with, comments, on, the, styles, that, he, encountered, he, found, much, of, what, he, heard, dull, and, impersonal, electronic, music, seemed, to, have, a, depressing, sameness, of, sound, while, aleatoric, music, was, for, those, who, enjoy, teetering, on, the, edge, of, chaos, as, he, summarized, i, ve, spent, most, of, my, life, trying, to, get, the, right, note, in, the, right, place, just, throwing, it, open, to, chance, seems, to, go, against, my, natural, instincts, in, 1952, copland, received, a, commission, from, the, league, of, composers, funded, by, a, grant, from, richard, rodgers, and, oscar, hammerstein, to, write, an, opera, for, television, while, copland, was, aware, of, the, potential, pitfalls, of, that, genre, which, included, weak, libretti, and, demanding, production, values, he, had, also, been, thinking, about, writing, an, opera, since, the, 1940s, among, the, subjects, he, had, considered, were, theodore, dreiser, s, an, american, tragedy, and, frank, norris, s, mcteague, he, finally, settled, on, james, agee, s, let, us, now, praise, famous, men, which, seemed, appropriate, for, the, more, intimate, setting, of, television, and, could, also, be, used, in, the, college, trade, with, more, schools, mounting, operas, than, they, had, before, world, war, ii, the, resulting, opera, the, tender, land, was, written, in, two, acts, but, later, expanded, to, three, as, copland, feared, when, the, opera, premiered, in, 1954, critics, found, the, libretto, to, be, weak, in, spite, of, its, flaws, the, opera, became, one, of, the, few, american, operas, to, enter, the, standard, repertory, in, 1957, 1958, and, 1976, copland, was, the, music, director, of, the, ojai, music, festival, a, classical, and, contemporary, music, festival, in, ojai, california, for, the, occasion, of, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, centennial, copland, composed, ceremonial, fanfare, for, brass, ensemble, to, accompany, the, exhibition, masterpieces, of, fifty, centuries, leonard, bernstein, piston, william, schuman, and, thomson, also, composed, pieces, for, the, museum, s, centennial, exhibitions, from, the, 1960s, onward, copland, turned, increasingly, to, conducting, though, not, enamored, with, the, prospect, he, found, himself, without, new, ideas, for, composition, saying, it, was, exactly, as, if, someone, had, simply, turned, off, a, faucet, he, became, a, frequent, guest, conductor, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, and, made, a, series, of, recordings, of, his, music, primarily, for, columbia, records, in, 1960, rca, victor, released, copland, s, recordings, with, the, boston, symphony, orchestra, of, the, orchestral, suites, from, appalachian, spring, and, the, tender, land, these, recordings, were, later, reissued, on, cd, as, were, most, of, copland, s, columbia, recordings, by, sony, from, 1960, until, his, death, copland, resided, at, cortlandt, manor, new, york, known, as, rock, hill, his, home, was, added, to, the, national, register, of, historic, places, in, 2003, and, further, designated, a, national, historic, landmark, in, 2008, copland, s, health, deteriorated, through, the, 1980s, and, he, died, of, alzheimer, s, disease, and, respiratory, failure, on, december, 2, 1990, in, north, tarrytown, new, york, now, sleepy, hollow, following, his, death, his, ashes, were, scattered, over, the, tanglewood, music, center, near, lenox, massachusetts, much, of, his, large, estate, was, bequeathed, to, the, creation, of, the, aaron, copland, fund, for, composers, which, bestows, over, 600, 000, per, year, to, performing, groups, copland, never, enrolled, as, a, member, of, any, political, party, nevertheless, he, inherited, a, considerable, interest, in, civic, and, world, events, from, his, father, his, views, were, generally, progressive, and, he, had, strong, ties, with, numerous, colleagues, and, friends, in, the, popular, front, including, odets, early, in, his, life, copland, developed, in, pollack, s, words, a, deep, admiration, for, the, works, of, frank, norris, theodore, dreiser, and, upton, sinclair, all, socialists, whose, novels, passionately, excoriated, capitalism, s, physical, and, emotional, toll, on, the, average, man, even, after, the, mccarthy, hearings, he, remained, a, committed, opponent, of, militarism, and, the, cold, war, which, he, regarded, as, having, been, instigated, by, the, united, states, he, condemned, it, as, almost, worse, for, art, than, the, real, thing, throw, the, artist, into, a, mood, of, suspicion, ill, will, and, dread, that, typifies, the, cold, war, attitude, and, he, ll, create, nothing, while, copland, had, various, encounters, with, organized, religious, thought, which, influenced, some, of, his, early, compositions, he, remained, agnostic, he, was, close, with, zionism, during, the, popular, front, movement, when, it, was, endorsed, by, the, left, pollack, writes, like, many, contemporaries, copland, regarded, judaism, alternately, in, terms, of, religion, culture, and, race, but, he, showed, relatively, little, involvement, in, any, aspect, of, his, jewish, heritage, at, the, same, time, he, had, ties, to, christianity, identifying, with, such, profoundly, christian, writers, as, gerard, manley, hopkins, and, often, spending, christmas, day, at, home, with, a, special, dinner, with, close, friends, in, general, his, music, seemed, to, evoke, protestant, hymns, as, often, as, it, did, jewish, chant, copland, characteristically, found, connections, among, various, religious, traditions, but, if, copland, was, discreet, about, his, jewish, background, he, never, hid, it, either, pollack, states, that, copland, was, gay, and, that, the, composer, came, to, an, early, acceptance, and, understanding, of, his, sexuality, like, many, at, that, time, copland, guarded, his, privacy, especially, in, regard, to, his, homosexuality, he, provided, few, written, details, about, his, private, life, and, even, after, the, stonewall, riots, of, 1969, showed, no, inclination, to, come, out, however, he, was, one, of, the, few, composers, of, his, stature, to, live, openly, and, travel, with, his, intimates, they, tended, to, be, talented, younger, men, involved, in, the, arts, and, the, age, gap, between, them, and, the, composer, widened, as, he, grew, older, most, became, enduring, friends, after, a, few, years, and, in, pollack, s, words, remained, a, primary, source, of, companionship, among, copland, s, love, affairs, were, ones, with, photographer, victor, kraft, artist, alvin, ross, pianist, paul, moor, dancer, erik, johns, composer, john, brodbin, kennedy, and, painter, prentiss, taylor, victor, kraft, became, a, constant, in, copland, s, life, though, their, romance, might, have, ended, by, 1944, originally, a, violin, prodigy, when, the, composer, met, him, in, 1932, kraft, gave, up, music, to, pursue, a, career, in, photography, in, part, due, to, copland, s, urging, kraft, would, leave, and, re, enter, copland, s, life, often, bringing, much, stress, with, him, as, his, behavior, became, increasingly, erratic, sometimes, confrontational, kraft, fathered, a, child, to, whom, copland, later, provided, financial, security, through, a, bequest, from, his, estate, vivian, perlis, who, collaborated, with, copland, on, his, autobiography, writes, copland, s, method, of, composing, was, to, write, down, fragments, of, musical, ideas, as, they, came, to, him, when, he, needed, a, piece, he, would, turn, to, these, ideas, his, gold, nuggets, if, one, or, more, of, these, nuggets, looked, promising, he, would, then, write, a, piano, sketch, and, eventually, work, on, them, at, the, keyboard, the, piano, perlis, writes, was, so, integral, to, his, composing, that, it, permeated, his, compositional, style, not, only, in, the, frequent, use, in, the, instrument, but, in, more, subtle, and, complex, ways, his, habit, of, turning, to, the, keyboard, tended, to, embarrass, copland, until, he, learned, that, stravinsky, also, did, so, copland, would, not, consider, the, specific, instrumentation, for, a, piece, until, it, was, complete, and, notated, nor, according, to, pollack, did, he, generally, work, in, linear, fashion, from, beginning, to, end, of, a, composition, instead, he, tended, to, compose, whole, sections, in, no, particular, order, and, surmise, their, eventual, sequence, after, all, those, parts, were, complete, much, like, assembling, a, collage, copland, himself, admitted, i, don, t, compose, i, assemble, materials, many, times, he, included, material, he, had, written, years, earlier, if, the, situation, dictated, as, it, did, with, his, film, scores, copland, could, work, quickly, otherwise, he, tended, to, write, slowly, whenever, possible, even, with, this, deliberation, copland, considered, composition, in, his, words, the, product, of, the, emotions, which, included, self, expression, and, self, discovery, while, copland, s, earliest, musical, inclinations, as, a, teenager, ran, toward, chopin, debussy, verdi, and, the, russian, composers, copland, s, teacher, and, mentor, nadia, boulanger, became, his, most, important, influence, copland, especially, admired, boulanger, s, total, grasp, of, all, classical, music, and, he, was, encouraged, to, experiment, and, develop, a, clarity, of, conception, and, elegance, in, proportion, following, her, model, he, studied, all, periods, of, classical, music, and, all, forms, from, madrigals, to, symphonies, this, breadth, of, vision, led, copland, to, compose, music, for, numerous, settings, orchestra, opera, solo, piano, small, ensemble, art, song, ballet, theater, and, film, boulanger, particularly, emphasized, la, grande, ligne, the, long, line, a, sense, of, forward, motion, the, feeling, for, inevitability, for, the, creating, of, an, entire, piece, that, could, be, thought, of, as, a, functioning, entity, during, his, studies, with, boulanger, in, paris, copland, was, excited, to, be, so, close, to, the, new, post, impressionistic, french, music, of, ravel, roussel, and, satie, as, well, as, les, six, a, group, that, included, milhaud, poulenc, and, honegger, webern, berg, and, bart, k, also, impressed, him, copland, was, insatiable, in, seeking, out, the, newest, european, music, whether, in, concerts, score, reading, or, heated, debate, these, moderns, were, discarding, the, old, laws, of, composition, and, experimenting, with, new, forms, harmonies, and, rhythms, and, including, the, use, of, jazz, and, quarter, tone, music, milhaud, was, copland, s, inspiration, for, some, of, his, earlier, jazzy, works, he, was, also, exposed, to, schoenberg, and, admired, his, earlier, atonal, pieces, thinking, schoenberg, s, pierrot, lunaire, above, all, others, copland, named, igor, stravinsky, as, his, hero, and, his, favorite, 20th, century, composer, copland, especially, admired, stravinsky, s, jagged, and, uncouth, rhythmic, effects, bold, use, of, dissonance, and, hard, dry, crackling, sonority, another, inspiration, for, much, of, copland, s, music, was, jazz, although, familiar, with, jazz, back, in, america, having, listened, to, it, and, also, played, it, in, bands, he, fully, realized, its, potential, while, traveling, in, austria, the, impression, of, jazz, one, receives, in, a, foreign, country, is, totally, unlike, the, impression, of, such, music, heard, in, one, s, own, country, when, i, heard, jazz, played, in, vienna, it, was, like, hearing, it, for, the, first, time, he, also, found, that, the, distance, from, his, native, country, helped, him, see, the, united, states, more, clearly, beginning, in, 1923, he, employed, jazzy, elements, in, his, classical, music, but, by, the, late, 1930s, he, moved, on, to, latin, and, american, folk, tunes, in, his, more, successful, pieces, although, his, early, focus, of, jazz, gave, way, to, other, influences, copland, continued, to, make, use, of, jazz, in, more, subtle, ways, in, later, works, copland, s, work, from, the, late, 1940s, onward, included, experimentation, with, schoenberg, s, twelve, tone, system, resulting, in, two, major, works, the, piano, quartet, 1950, and, the, piano, fantasy, 1957, copland, s, compositions, before, leaving, for, paris, were, mainly, short, works, for, piano, and, art, songs, inspired, by, liszt, and, debussy, in, them, he, experimented, with, ambiguous, beginnings, and, endings, rapid, key, changes, and, the, frequent, use, of, tritones, his, first, published, work, the, cat, and, the, mouse, 1920, was, a, piece, for, piano, solo, based, on, the, jean, de, la, fontaine, fable, the, old, cat, and, the, young, mouse, in, three, moods, 1921, copland, s, final, movement, is, entitled, jazzy, which, he, noted, is, based, on, two, jazz, melodies, and, ought, to, make, the, old, professors, sit, up, and, take, notice, the, symphony, for, organ, and, orchestra, established, copland, as, a, serious, modern, composer, musicologist, gayle, murchison, cites, copland, s, use, melodic, harmonic, and, rhythmic, elements, endemic, in, jazz, which, he, would, also, use, in, his, music, for, the, theater, and, piano, concerto, to, evoke, an, essentially, american, sound, he, fuses, these, qualities, with, modernist, elements, such, as, octatonic, and, whole, tone, scales, polyrhythmic, ostinato, figures, and, dissonant, counterpoint, murchinson, points, out, the, influence, of, igor, stravinsky, in, the, work, s, nervous, driving, rhythms, and, some, of, its, harmonic, language, copland, in, hindsight, found, the, work, too, european, as, he, consciously, sought, a, more, consciously, american, idiom, to, evoke, in, his, future, work, visits, to, europe, in, 1926, and, 1927, brought, him, into, contact, with, the, most, recent, developments, there, including, webern, s, five, pieces, for, orchestra, which, greatly, impressed, him, in, august, 1927, while, staying, in, k, nigstein, copland, wrote, poet, s, song, a, setting, of, a, text, by, e, e, cummings, and, his, first, composition, using, schoenberg, s, twelve, tone, technique, this, was, followed, by, the, symphonic, ode, 1929, and, the, piano, variations, 1930, both, of, which, rely, on, the, exhaustive, development, of, a, single, short, motif, this, procedure, which, provided, copland, with, more, formal, flexibility, and, a, greater, emotional, range, than, in, his, earlier, music, is, similar, to, schoenberg, s, idea, of, continuous, variation, and, according, to, copland, s, own, admission, was, influenced, by, the, twelve, tone, method, though, neither, work, actually, uses, a, twelve, tone, row, the, other, major, work, of, copland, s, first, period, is, the, short, symphony, 1933, in, it, music, critic, and, musicologist, michael, steinberg, writes, the, jazz, influenced, dislocations, of, meter, that, are, so, characteristic, of, copland, s, music, of, the, 1920s, are, more, prevalent, than, ever, compared, to, the, symphonic, ode, the, orchestration, is, much, leaner, and, the, composition, itself, more, concentrated, in, its, combination, and, refinement, of, modernist, and, jazz, elements, steinberg, calls, the, short, symphony, a, remarkable, synthesis, of, the, learned, and, the, vernacular, and, thus, in, all, its, brevity, a, singularly, complete, representation, of, its, composer, however, copland, moved, from, this, work, toward, more, accessible, works, and, folk, sources, copland, wrote, el, sal, n, m, xico, between, 1932, and, 1936, which, met, with, a, popular, acclaim, that, contrasted, the, relative, obscurity, of, most, of, his, previous, works, inspiration, for, this, work, came, from, copland, s, vivid, recollection, of, visiting, the, salon, mexico, dancehall, where, he, witnessed, a, more, intimate, view, of, mexico, s, nightlife, copland, derived, his, melodic, material, for, this, piece, freely, from, two, collections, of, mexican, folk, tunes, changing, pitches, and, varying, rhythms, the, use, of, a, folk, tune, with, variations, set, in, a, symphonic, context, started, a, pattern, he, repeated, in, many, of, his, most, successful, works, right, on, through, the, 1940s, it, also, marked, a, shift, in, emphasis, from, a, unified, musical, structure, to, the, rhetorical, effect, the, music, might, have, on, an, audience, and, showed, copland, refining, a, simplified, more, accessible, musical, language, el, sal, n, prepared, copland, to, write, the, ballet, score, billy, the, kid, which, became, in, pollack, s, words, an, archetypical, depiction, of, the, legendary, american, west, based, on, a, walter, noble, burns, novel, with, choreography, by, eugene, loring, billy, was, among, the, first, to, display, an, american, music, and, dance, vocabulary, copland, used, six, cowboy, folk, songs, to, provide, period, atmosphere, and, employed, polyrhythm, and, polyharmony, when, not, quoting, these, tunes, literally, to, maintain, the, work, s, overall, tone, in, this, way, copland, s, music, worked, much, in, the, same, way, as, the, murals, of, thomas, hart, benton, in, that, it, employed, elements, that, could, be, grasped, easily, by, a, mass, audience, the, ballet, premiered, in, new, york, in, 1939, with, copland, recalling, i, cannot, remember, another, work, of, mine, that, was, so, unanimously, received, along, with, the, ballet, rodeo, billy, the, kid, became, in, the, words, of, musicologist, elizabeth, crist, the, basis, for, copland, s, reputation, as, a, composer, of, americana, and, defines, an, uncomplicated, form, of, american, nationalism, copland, s, brand, of, nationalism, in, his, ballets, differed, from, that, of, european, composers, such, as, b, la, bart, k, who, tried, to, preserve, the, folk, tones, they, used, as, close, to, the, original, as, possible, copland, enhanced, the, tunes, he, used, with, contemporary, rhythms, textures, and, structures, in, what, could, seem, contradictory, he, used, complex, harmonies, and, rhythms, to, simplify, folk, melodies, and, make, them, more, accessible, and, familiar, to, his, listeners, except, for, the, shaker, tune, in, appalachian, spring, copland, often, syncopates, traditional, melodies, changes, their, metric, patterns, and, note, values, in, billy, the, kid, he, derives, many, of, the, work, s, sparse, harmonies, from, the, implied, harmonic, constructions, of, the, cowboy, tunes, themselves, like, stravinsky, copland, mastered, the, ability, to, create, a, coherent, integrated, composition, from, what, was, essentially, a, mosaic, of, divergent, folk, based, and, original, elements, in, that, sense, copland, s, populist, works, such, as, billy, the, kid, rodeo, appalachian, spring, are, not, far, removed, from, stravinsky, s, ballet, the, rite, of, spring, within, that, framework, however, copland, preserved, the, american, atmosphere, of, these, ballets, through, what, musicologist, elliott, antokoletz, calls, the, conservative, handling, of, open, diatonic, sonorities, which, fosters, a, pastoral, quality, in, the, music, this, is, especially, true, in, the, opening, of, appalachian, spring, where, the, harmonizations, remain, transparent, and, bare, suggested, by, the, melodic, disposition, of, the, shaker, tune, variations, which, contrast, to, this, tune, in, rhythm, key, texture, and, dynamics, fit, within, copland, s, compositional, practice, of, juxtaposing, structural, blocks, when, hollywood, beckoned, concert, hall, composers, in, the, 1930s, with, promises, of, better, films, and, higher, pay, copland, saw, both, a, challenge, for, his, abilities, as, a, composer, as, well, as, an, opportunity, to, expand, his, reputation, and, audience, for, his, more, serious, works, in, a, departure, from, other, film, scores, of, the, time, copland, s, work, largely, reflected, his, own, style, instead, of, the, usual, borrowing, from, the, late, romantic, period, he, often, avoided, the, full, orchestra, and, he, rejected, the, common, practice, of, using, a, leitmotif, to, identify, characters, with, their, own, personal, themes, he, instead, matched, a, theme, to, the, action, while, avoiding, the, underlining, of, every, action, with, exaggerated, emphasis, another, technique, copland, employed, was, to, keep, silent, during, intimate, screen, moments, and, only, begin, the, music, as, a, confirming, motive, toward, the, end, of, a, scene, virgil, thomson, wrote, that, the, score, for, of, mice, and, men, established, the, most, distinguished, populist, musical, style, yet, created, in, america, many, composers, who, scored, for, western, movies, particularly, between, 1940, and, 1960, were, influenced, by, copland, s, style, though, some, also, followed, the, late, romantic, max, steiner, approach, which, was, considered, more, conventional, and, desirable, copland, s, work, in, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, included, use, of, schoenberg, s, twelve, tone, system, a, development, that, he, had, recognized, but, not, fully, embraced, he, had, also, believed, the, atonality, of, serialized, music, to, run, counter, to, his, desire, to, reach, a, wide, audience, copland, therefore, approached, dodecaphony, with, some, initial, skepticism, while, in, europe, in, 1949, he, heard, a, number, of, serial, works, but, did, not, admire, much, of, it, because, so, often, it, seemed, that, individuality, was, sacrificed, to, the, method, the, music, of, french, composer, pierre, boulez, showed, copland, that, the, technique, could, be, separated, from, the, old, wagnerian, aesthetic, with, which, he, had, associated, it, previously, subsequent, exposure, to, the, late, music, of, austrian, composer, anton, webern, and, twelve, tone, pieces, by, swiss, composer, frank, martin, and, italian, composer, luigi, dallapiccola, strengthened, this, opinion, copland, came, to, the, conclusion, that, composing, along, serial, lines, was, nothing, more, than, an, angle, of, vision, like, fugal, treatment, it, is, a, stimulus, that, enlivens, musical, thinking, especially, when, applied, to, a, series, of, tones, that, lend, themselves, to, that, treatment, he, began, his, first, serial, work, the, piano, fantasy, in, 1951, to, fulfill, a, commission, from, the, young, virtuoso, pianist, william, kapell, the, piece, became, one, of, his, most, challenging, works, over, which, he, labored, until, 1957, during, the, work, s, development, in, 1953, kapell, died, in, an, aircraft, crash, critics, lauded, the, fantasy, when, it, was, finally, premiered, calling, the, piece, an, outstanding, addition, to, his, own, oeuvre, and, to, contemporary, piano, literature, and, a, tremendous, achievement, jay, rosenfield, stated, this, is, a, new, copland, to, us, an, artist, advancing, with, strength, and, not, building, on, the, past, alone, serialism, allowed, copland, a, synthesis, of, serial, and, non, serial, practices, before, he, did, this, according, to, musicologist, joseph, straus, the, philosophical, and, compositional, difference, between, non, tonal, composers, such, as, schoenberg, and, tonal, composers, like, stravinsky, had, been, considered, too, wide, a, gulf, to, bridge, copland, wrote, that, to, him, serialism, pointed, in, two, opposite, directions, one, toward, the, extreme, of, total, organization, with, electronic, applications, and, the, other, a, gradual, absorption, into, what, had, become, a, very, freely, interpreted, tonalism, the, path, he, said, he, chose, was, the, latter, one, which, he, said, when, he, described, his, piano, fantasy, allowed, him, to, incorporate, elements, able, to, be, associated, with, the, twelve, tone, method, and, also, with, music, tonally, conceived, this, practice, differed, markedly, from, schoenberg, who, used, his, tone, rows, as, complete, statements, around, which, to, structure, his, compositions, copland, used, his, rows, not, very, differently, from, how, he, fashioned, the, material, in, his, tonal, pieces, he, saw, his, rows, as, sources, for, melodies, and, harmonies, not, as, complete, and, independent, entities, except, at, points, in, the, musical, structure, that, dictated, the, complete, statement, of, a, row, even, after, copland, started, using, 12, tone, techniques, he, did, not, stick, to, them, exclusively, but, went, back, and, forth, between, tonal, and, non, tonal, compositions, other, late, works, include, dance, panels, 1959, ballet, music, something, wild, 1961, his, last, film, score, much, of, which, would, be, later, incorporated, into, his, music, for, a, great, city, connotations, 1962, for, the, new, lincoln, center, philharmonic, hall, emblems, 1964, for, wind, band, night, thoughts, 1972, for, the, van, cliburn, international, piano, competition, and, proclamation, 1982, his, last, work, started, in, 1973, copland, did, not, consider, himself, a, professional, writer, he, called, his, writing, a, byproduct, of, my, trade, as, a, kind, of, salesman, for, contemporary, music, as, such, he, wrote, prolifically, about, music, including, pieces, on, music, criticism, analysis, on, musical, trends, and, on, his, own, compositions, an, avid, lecturer, and, lecturer, performer, copland, eventually, collected, his, presentation, notes, into, three, books, what, to, listen, for, in, music, 1939, our, new, music, 1941, and, music, and, imagination, 1952, in, the, 1980s, he, collaborated, with, vivian, perlis, on, a, two, volume, autobiography, copland, 1900, through, 1942, 1984, and, copland, since, 1943, 1989, along, with, the, composer, s, first, person, narrative, these, two, books, incorporate, 11, interludes, by, perlis, and, other, sections, from, friends, and, peers, some, controversy, arose, over, the, second, volume, s, increased, reliance, over, the, first, on, old, documents, for, source, material, due, to, the, then, advanced, stage, of, copland, s, alzheimer, s, and, the, resulting, memory, loss, however, this, fallback, to, previous, material, was, inevitable, the, use, in, both, books, of, letters, and, other, unpublished, sources, expertly, researched, and, organized, made, them, what, pollack, terms, invaluable, during, his, career, copland, met, and, helped, hundreds, of, young, composers, whom, he, met, and, who, were, drawn, to, him, by, his, continual, interest, and, acuity, into, the, contemporary, musical, scene, this, assistance, came, mainly, outside, an, institutional, framework, other, than, his, summers, at, the, berkshire, music, center, at, tanglewood, a, decade, of, teaching, and, curating, at, the, new, school, and, a, few, semesters, at, harvard, and, the, state, university, of, new, york, at, buffalo, copland, operated, outside, an, academic, setting, pollack, writes, those, composers, who, actually, studied, with, him, were, small, in, number, and, did, so, for, only, brief, periods, rather, copland, helped, younger, composers, more, informally, with, intermittent, advice, and, aid, this, advice, included, focusing, on, expressive, content, rather, than, on, purely, technical, points, and, on, developing, a, personal, style, copland, s, willingness, to, foster, talent, extended, to, critiquing, scores, in, progress, that, were, presented, to, him, by, his, peers, composer, william, schuman, writes, as, a, teacher, aaron, was, extraordinary, copland, would, look, at, your, music, and, try, to, understand, what, you, were, after, he, didn, t, want, to, turn, you, into, another, aaron, copland, when, he, questioned, something, it, was, in, a, manner, that, might, make, you, want, to, question, it, yourself, everything, he, said, was, helpful, in, making, a, younger, composer, realize, the, potential, of, a, particular, work, on, the, other, hand, aaron, could, be, strongly, critical, although, copland, studied, conducting, in, paris, in, 1921, he, remained, essentially, a, self, taught, conductor, with, a, very, personal, style, encouraged, by, igor, stravinsky, to, master, conducting, and, perhaps, emboldened, by, carlos, chavez, s, efforts, in, mexico, he, began, to, direct, his, own, works, on, his, international, travels, in, the, 1940s, by, the, 1950s, he, was, also, conducting, the, works, of, other, composers, and, after, a, televised, appearance, where, he, directed, the, new, york, philharmonic, copland, became, in, high, demand, he, placed, a, strong, emphasis, in, his, programs, on, 20th, century, music, and, lesser, known, composers, and, until, the, 1970s, rarely, planned, concerts, to, feature, his, music, exclusively, performers, and, audiences, generally, greeted, his, conducting, appearances, as, positive, opportunities, to, hear, his, music, as, the, composer, intended, his, efforts, on, behalf, of, other, composers, could, be, penetrating, but, also, uneven, understated, on, the, podium, copland, modeled, his, style, after, other, composer, conductors, such, as, stravinsky, and, paul, hindemith, critics, wrote, of, his, precision, and, clarity, before, an, orchestra, observers, noted, that, he, had, none, of, the, typical, conductorial, vanities, copland, s, unpretentious, charm, was, appreciated, by, professional, musicians, but, some, criticized, his, unsteady, beat, and, unexciting, interpretations, koussevitzky, advised, him, to, stay, home, and, compose, copland, at, times, asked, for, conducting, advice, from, bernstein, who, occasionally, joked, that, copland, could, conduct, his, works, a, little, better, bernstein, also, noted, that, copland, improved, over, time, and, he, considered, him, a, more, natural, conductor, than, stravinsky, or, hindemith, eventually, copland, recorded, nearly, all, his, orchestral, works, with, himself, conducting, copland, wrote, a, total, of, about, 100, works, which, covered, a, diverse, range, of, genres, many, of, these, compositions, especially, orchestral, pieces, have, remained, part, of, the, standard, american, repertoire, according, to, pollack, copland, had, perhaps, the, most, distinctive, and, identifiable, musical, voice, produced, by, this, country, so, far, an, individuality, that, helped, define, for, many, what, american, concert, music, sounds, like, at, its, most, characteristic, and, that, exerted, enormous, influence, on, multitudes, of, contemporaries, and, successors, his, synthesis, of, influences, and, inclinations, helped, create, the, americanism, of, his, music, the, composer, himself, pointed, out, in, summarizing, the, american, character, of, his, music, the, optimistic, tone, his, love, of, rather, large, canvases, a, certain, directness, in, expression, of, sentiment, and, a, certain, songfulness, while, copland, s, musical, rhetoric, has, become, iconic, and, has, functioned, as, a, mirror, of, america, conductor, leon, botstein, suggests, that, the, composer, helped, define, the, modern, consciousness, of, america, s, ideals, character, and, sense, of, place, the, notion, that, his, music, played, not, a, subsidiary, but, a, central, role, in, the, shaping, of, the, national, consciousness, makes,
