forgiveness, during, his, time, there, he, met, frank, fisher, a, black, seminarian, who, introduced, him, to, the, abyssinian, baptist, church, in, harlem, where, bonhoeffer, taught, sunday, school, and, formed, a, lifelong, love, for, the, african, american, church, he, heard, adam, clayton, powell, sr, preach, the, gospel, of, social, justice, and, became, sensitive, to, the, social,

the, belief, that, god, s, commandments, were, carried, out, and, was, always, captivated, by, the, sermons, the, originally, nationalist, bonhoeffer, later, changed, his, views, after, seeing, all, quiet, on, the, western, front, which, showed, the, horrors, of, war, later, in, life, he, favored, the, views, of, pacifism, because, of, love, for, all, and, a, high, value, on, each, individual, life, it, was, because, of, these, views, that, bonhoeffer, later, became, an, activist, against, abortion, which, he, referred, to, as, the, american, holocaust, bonhoeffer, became, involved, with, the, ecumenical, christian, movement, which, eventually, led, him, to, resist, hitler, and, the, nazis, after, returning, to, germany, in, 1931, bonhoeffer, became, a, lecturer, in, systematic, theology, at, the, university, of, berlin, deeply, interested, in, ecumenism, he, was, appointed, by, the, world, alliance, for, promoting, international, friendship, through, the, churches, a, forerunner, of, the, world, council, of, churches, as, one, of, its, three, european, youth, secretaries, at, this, time, he, seems, to, have, undergone, a, personal, conversion, as, he, changed, from, being, a, theologian, primarily, attracted, to, the, intellectual, side, of, christianity, to, being, a, dedicated, man, of, personal, faith, resolved, to, literally, carry, out, the, teachings, of, christ, revealed, in, the, gospels, on, 15, november, 1931, at, the, age, of, 25, he, was, ordained, at, old, prussian, united, st, matthew, in, berlin, tiergarten, bonhoeffer, s, promising, academic, and, ecclesiastical, career, was, dramatically, knocked, off, course, by, the, nazi, ascent, to, power, on, 30, january, 1933, he, was, a, determined, opponent, of, the, regime, from, its, first, days, two, days, after, hitler, was, installed, as, chancellor, bonhoeffer, delivered, a, radio, address, in, which, he, attacked, hitler, and, warned, germany, against, slipping, into, an, idolatrous, cult, of, the, f, hrer, leader, who, could, very, well, turn, out, to, be, verf, hrer, misleader, seducer, his, broadcast, was, abruptly, cut, off, though, it, is, unclear, whether, the, newly, elected, nazi, regime, was, responsible, in, april, 1933, bonhoeffer, raised, the, first, voice, for, church, resistance, to, hitler, s, persecution, of, jews, declaring, that, the, church, must, not, simply, bandage, the, victims, under, the, wheel, but, jam, a, spoke, in, the, wheel, itself, in, november, 1932, two, months, before, the, nazi, takeover, there, had, been, an, election, for, presbyters, and, synodals, church, officials, of, the, german, landeskirche, protestant, mainstream, churches, this, election, was, marked, by, a, struggle, within, the, old, prussian, union, protestant, church, between, the, pro, nazi, deutsche, christen, german, christian, movement, and, young, reformers, who, were, interested, in, following, the, gospel, teachings, of, jesus, a, struggle, that, threatened, to, explode, into, schism, in, july, 1933, hitler, unconstitutionally, imposed, new, church, elections, bonhoeffer, put, all, his, efforts, into, the, election, campaigning, for, the, selection, of, independent, non, nazi, officials, who, were, dedicated, to, following, christ, despite, bonhoeffer, s, efforts, in, the, july, election, an, overwhelming, number, of, key, church, positions, went, to, the, deutsche, christen, the, deutsche, christen, won, a, majority, in, the, old, prussian, general, synod, and, all, its, provincial, synods, except, westphalia, and, in, synods, of, all, other, protestant, church, bodies, except, for, the, lutheran, churches, of, bavaria, hanover, and, w, rttemberg, the, anti, nazi, christian, opposition, regarded, these, bodies, as, uncorrupted, intact, churches, as, opposed, to, the, other, so, called, destroyed, churches, in, opposition, to, nazification, bonhoeffer, urged, an, interdict, to, stop, offering, all, pastoral, ceremonial, services, baptisms, confirmations, weddings, funerals, etc, but, karl, barth, and, others, advised, against, such, a, radical, proposal, in, august, 1933, bonhoeffer, and, hermann, sasse, were, deputized, by, opposition, church, leaders, to, draft, the, bethel, confession, as, a, new, statement, of, faith, in, opposition, to, the, deutsche, christen, movement, notable, for, affirming, god, s, fidelity, to, jews, as, his, chosen, people, the, bethel, confession, was, eventually, so, watered, down, to, make, it, more, palatable, that, ultimately, bonhoeffer, refused, to, sign, it, in, september, 1933, the, nationalist, church, synod, at, wittenberg, voluntarily, passed, a, resolution, to, apply, the, aryan, paragraph, within, the, church, meaning, that, pastors, and, church, officials, of, jewish, descent, were, to, be, removed, from, their, posts, regarding, this, as, an, affront, to, the, principle, of, baptism, martin, niem, ller, founded, the, pfarrernotbund, pastors, emergency, league, in, november, a, rally, of, 20, 000, nationalist, deutsche, christens, demanded, the, removal, of, the, jewish, old, testament, from, the, bible, which, was, seen, by, many, as, heresy, further, swelling, the, ranks, of, the, pastors, emergency, league, within, weeks, of, its, founding, more, than, a, third, of, german, pastors, had, joined, the, emergency, league, it, was, the, forerunner, of, the, bekennende, kirche, confessing, church, which, aimed, to, preserve, historical, biblically, based, christian, beliefs, and, practices, the, barmen, declaration, drafted, by, barth, in, may, 1934, and, adopted, by, the, confessing, church, insisted, that, christ, not, the, f, hrer, is, the, head, of, the, church, the, adoption, of, the, declaration, has, often, been, viewed, as, a, triumph, although, by, estimate, only, 20, of, german, pastors, supported, the, confessing, church, when, bonhoeffer, was, offered, a, parish, post, in, eastern, berlin, in, the, autumn, of, 1933, he, refused, it, in, protest, at, the, nationalist, policy, and, accepted, a, two, year, appointment, as, a, pastor, of, two, german, speaking, protestant, churches, in, london, the, german, lutheran, church, in, dacres, road, sydenham, and, the, german, reformed, church, of, st, paul, s, goulston, street, whitechapel, he, explained, to, barth, that, he, had, found, little, support, for, his, views, on, devotion, to, literally, following, the, words, of, jesus, even, among, friends, and, that, it, was, about, time, to, go, for, a, while, into, the, desert, barth, regarded, this, as, running, away, from, a, real, battle, he, sharply, rebuked, bonhoeffer, saying, i, can, only, reply, to, all, the, reasons, and, excuses, which, you, put, forward, and, what, will, now, happen, to, the, people, of, the, german, church, barth, accused, bonhoeffer, of, abandoning, his, post, and, wasting, his, splendid, theological, armory, while, the, house, of, your, church, is, on, fire, and, chided, him, to, return, to, berlin, by, the, next, ship, bonhoeffer, however, did, not, go, to, england, simply, to, avoid, trouble, at, home, he, hoped, to, put, the, ecumenical, movement, to, work, in, the, interest, of, the, confessing, church, he, continued, his, involvement, with, the, confessing, church, running, up, a, high, telephone, bill, to, maintain, his, contact, with, martin, niem, ller, in, international, gatherings, bonhoeffer, rallied, people, to, oppose, the, nationalist, deutsche, christen, movement, and, its, attempt, to, amalgamate, nazi, nationalism, with, christianity, when, bishop, theodor, heckel, the, official, in, charge, of, german, lutheran, church, foreign, affairs, traveled, to, london, to, warn, bonhoeffer, to, abstain, from, any, ecumenical, activity, not, directly, authorized, by, berlin, bonhoeffer, refused, to, abstain, in, 1935, bonhoeffer, was, offered, a, coveted, opportunity, to, study, non, violent, resistance, under, gandhi, in, his, ashram, however, remembering, barth, s, rebuke, bonhoeffer, decided, to, return, to, germany, instead, where, he, was, the, head, at, an, underground, seminary, in, finkenwalde, for, training, confessing, church, pastors, as, the, nazi, suppression, of, the, confessing, church, intensified, barth, was, driven, back, to, switzerland, in, 1935, niem, ller, was, arrested, in, july, 1937, and, in, august, 1936, bonhoeffer, s, authorization, to, teach, at, the, university, of, berlin, was, revoked, after, he, was, denounced, as, a, pacifist, and, enemy, of, the, state, by, theodor, heckel, bonhoeffer, s, efforts, for, the, underground, seminaries, included, securing, necessary, funds, he, found, a, great, benefactor, in, ruth, von, kleist, retzow, in, times, of, trouble, bonhoeffer, s, former, students, and, their, wives, would, take, refuge, in, von, kleist, retzow, s, pomeranian, estate, and, bonhoeffer, was, a, frequent, guest, later, he, fell, in, love, with, kleist, retzow, s, granddaughter, maria, von, wedemeyer, to, whom, he, became, engaged, three, months, before, his, arrest, in, 1943, by, august, 1937, himmler, had, decreed, the, education, and, examination, of, confessing, church, ministry, candidates, illegal, in, september, 1937, the, gestapo, closed, the, seminary, at, finkenwalde, and, by, november, arrested, 27, pastors, and, former, students, it, was, around, this, time, that, bonhoeffer, published, his, best, known, book, the, cost, of, discipleship, a, study, on, the, sermon, on, the, mount, in, which, he, attacked, cheap, grace, as, a, cover, for, ethical, laxity, against, the, virtues, of, costly, grace, bonhoeffer, spent, the, next, two, years, secretly, traveling, from, one, eastern, german, village, to, another, to, conduct, a, seminary, on, the, run, supervising, the, continuing, education, and, work, of, his, students, most, of, whom, were, working, illegally, in, small, parishes, within, the, old, prussian, ecclesiastical, province, of, pomerania, the, von, blumenthal, family, hosted, the, underground, seminary, on, its, estate, of, gro, schl, nwitz, the, pastors, of, gro, schl, nwitz, and, neighbouring, villages, supported, the, education, of, young, men, who, voluntarily, housed, these, seminarians, among, whom, was, eberhard, bethge, who, later, became, his, best, friend, and, edited, bonhoeffer, s, letters, and, papers, from, prison, and, employing, them, as, vicars, in, their, congregations, in, 1938, the, gestapo, banned, bonhoeffer, from, berlin, in, the, summer, of, 1939, the, seminary, was, able, to, move, to, sigurdshof, an, outlying, estate, vorwerk, of, the, von, kleist, family, in, wendisch, tychow, in, march, 1940, the, gestapo, shut, down, the, underground, seminary, there, following, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, bonhoeffer, s, semi, monastic, communal, life, and, teaching, at, the, underground, finkenwalde, seminary, formed, the, basis, of, his, books, the, cost, of, discipleship, and, life, together, bonhoeffer, s, sister, sabine, along, with, her, jewish, classified, husband, gerhard, leibholz, and, their, two, daughters, escaped, to, england, by, way, of, switzerland, in, 1938, in, february, 1938, bonhoeffer, made, an, initial, contact, with, members, of, the, german, resistance, when, his, brother, in, law, hans, von, dohn, nyi, introduced, him, to, a, group, seeking, hitler, s, overthrow, at, the, abwehr, the, german, military, intelligence, service, bonhoeffer, also, learned, from, dohn, nyi, that, war, was, imminent, he, was, particularly, troubled, by, the, prospect, of, being, conscripted, as, a, committed, christian, pacifist, opposed, to, the, nazi, regime, he, could, never, swear, an, oath, to, hitler, and, would, never, commit, any, violence, or, fight, in, hitler, s, army, though, refusal, to, do, so, was, potentially, a, capital, offense, he, worried, also, about, consequences, his, refusing, military, service, could, have, for, the, confessing, church, as, it, was, a, move, that, would, be, frowned, upon, by, most, nationalist, christians, and, their, churches, at, the, time, it, was, at, this, juncture, that, bonhoeffer, left, for, the, united, states, in, june, 1939, at, the, invitation, of, union, theological, seminary, in, new, york, after, much, inner, turmoil, he, soon, regretted, his, decision, and, returned, after, only, two, weeks, despite, strong, pressures, from, his, friends, to, stay, in, the, united, states, he, wrote, to, reinhold, niebuhr, i, have, come, to, the, conclusion, that, i, made, a, mistake, in, coming, to, america, this, time, i, must, live, through, this, difficult, period, in, our, national, history, along, with, the, people, of, germany, i, will, have, no, right, to, participate, in, the, reconstruction, of, christian, life, in, germany, after, the, war, if, i, do, not, share, the, trials, of, this, time, with, my, people, christians, in, germany, will, have, to, face, the, terrible, alternative, of, either, willing, the, defeat, of, their, nation, in, order, that, a, future, christian, civilization, may, survive, or, else, willing, the, victory, of, their, nation, and, thereby, destroying, our, civilization, and, any, true, christianity, i, know, which, of, these, alternatives, i, must, choose, but, i, cannot, make, that, choice, from, a, place, of, security, back, in, germany, bonhoeffer, was, further, harassed, by, the, nazi, authorities, as, he, was, forbidden, to, speak, in, public, and, was, required, regularly, to, report, his, activities, to, the, police, in, 1941, he, was, forbidden, to, print, or, to, publish, anything, in, the, meantime, bonhoeffer, had, joined, the, abwehr, a, german, intelligence, organization, dohn, nyi, already, part, of, the, abwehr, brought, him, into, the, organization, on, the, claim, that, his, wide, ecumenical, contacts, would, be, of, use, to, germany, thus, protecting, him, from, conscription, to, active, service, bonhoeffer, presumably, knew, about, various, 1943, plots, against, hitler, through, dohn, nyi, who, was, actively, involved, in, the, planning, in, the, face, of, nazi, atrocities, against, the, jews, and, other, minorities, the, full, scale, of, which, bonhoeffer, learned, through, the, abwehr, he, concluded, that, the, ultimate, question, for, a, responsible, man, to, ask, is, not, how, he, is, to, extricate, himself, from, this, whole, affair, but, how, the, coming, generation, shall, continue, to, survive, and, live, for, truth, he, did, not, justify, his, action, but, wrote, when, a, man, takes, guilt, upon, himself, in, responsibility, he, imputes, his, guilt, to, himself, and, no, one, else, he, answers, for, it, before, other, men, he, is, justified, by, dire, necessity, before, himself, he, is, acquitted, by, his, conscience, but, before, god, he, hopes, only, for, grace, in, a, 1932, sermon, bonhoeffer, said, the, blood, of, martyrs, might, once, again, be, demanded, but, this, blood, if, we, really, have, the, courage, and, loyalty, to, shed, it, will, not, be, innocent, shining, like, that, of, the, first, witnesses, for, the, faith, on, our, blood, lies, heavy, with, guilt, the, guilt, of, the, unprofitable, servant, who, is, cast, into, outer, darkness, under, cover, of, the, abwehr, bonhoeffer, served, as, a, courier, for, the, german, resistance, movement, to, reveal, its, existence, and, intentions, to, the, western, allies, in, hope, of, garnering, their, support, through, his, ecumenical, contacts, abroad, he, hoped, to, secure, possible, peace, terms, with, the, allies, for, a, post, hitler, government, in, may, 1942, he, met, anglican, bishop, george, bell, of, chichester, a, member, of, the, house, of, lords, and, an, ally, of, the, confessing, church, contacted, by, bonhoeffer, s, exiled, brother, in, law, leibholz, through, him, feelers, were, sent, to, british, foreign, secretary, anthony, eden, however, the, british, government, ignored, these, as, it, had, all, other, approaches, from, the, german, resistance, considering, all, germans, to, be, the, enemy, in, addition, british, war, policy, was, to, conduct, area, bombing, of, civilian, cities, which, bell, opposed, a, view, that, had, become, unpopular, in, britain, see, supporter, of, the, german, resistance, at, george, bell, bishop, dohn, nyi, and, bonhoeffer, were, also, involved, in, abwehr, operations, to, help, german, jews, escape, to, switzerland, during, this, time, bonhoeffer, worked, on, his, book, ethics, and, wrote, letters, to, keep, up, the, spirits, of, his, former, students, he, intended, ethics, as, his, magnum, opus, but, it, remained, unfinished, when, he, was, arrested, on, 5, april, 1943, bonhoeffer, and, dohn, nyi, were, arrested, and, imprisoned, on, 13, january, 1943, bonhoeffer, had, become, engaged, to, maria, von, wedemeyer, the, granddaughter, of, his, close, friend, and, finkenwalde, seminary, supporter, ruth, von, kleist, retzow, ruth, had, campaigned, for, this, marriage, for, several, years, although, up, until, late, october, 1942, bonhoeffer, remained, a, reluctant, suitor, despite, ruth, being, part, of, his, innermost, circle, he, considered, that, his, responsibilities, during, wartime, made, it, the, wrong, time, to, marry, a, large, age, gap, loomed, between, bonhoeffer, and, maria, he, was, 36, to, her, 18, bonhoeffer, had, first, met, his, would, be, fianc, e, maria, when, she, was, his, confirmation, student, at, age, eleven, as, was, considered, proper, at, the, time, the, two, had, spent, almost, no, time, together, alone, prior, to, the, engagement, and, did, not, see, each, other, between, becoming, engaged, and, bonhoeffer, s, 5, april, arrest, once, he, was, in, prison, however, maria, s, status, as, his, fianc, e, became, invaluable, as, it, meant, she, could, visit, bonhoeffer, and, correspond, with, him, while, their, relationship, was, troubled, she, was, a, source, of, food, and, smuggled, messages, bonhoeffer, made, eberhard, bethge, his, heir, but, maria, in, allowing, her, correspondence, with, bonhoeffer, to, be, published, after, her, death, provided, an, invaluable, addition, to, this, scholarship, for, a, year, and, a, half, bonhoeffer, was, imprisoned, at, tegel, prison, awaiting, trial, there, he, continued, his, work, in, religious, outreach, among, his, fellow, prisoners, and, guards, sympathetic, guards, helped, smuggle, his, letters, out, of, prison, to, eberhard, bethge, and, others, and, these, uncensored, letters, were, posthumously, published, in, letters, and, papers, from, prison, one, of, those, guards, a, corporal, named, knobloch, even, offered, to, help, him, escape, from, the, prison, and, disappear, with, him, and, plans, were, made, for, that, end, but, eventually, bonhoeffer, declined, it, fearing, nazi, retribution, against, his, family, especially, his, brother, klaus, and, brother, in, law, hans, von, dohn, nyi, who, was, also, imprisoned, on, 4, april, 1945, the, diaries, of, admiral, wilhelm, canaris, head, of, the, abwehr, were, discovered, and, in, a, rage, upon, reading, them, hitler, ordered, that, the, other, abwehr, members, be, executed, bonhoeffer, was, led, away, just, as, he, concluded, his, final, sunday, service, and, asked, an, english, prisoner, payne, best, to, remember, him, to, bishop, george, bell, of, chichester, if, best, should, ever, reach, his, home, this, is, the, end, but, for, me, it, is, the, beginning, of, life, bonhoeffer, was, sentenced, to, death, on, 8, april, 1945, by, ss, judge, otto, thorbeck, at, a, drumhead, court, martial, without, witnesses, without, any, evidence, against, him, with, no, records, of, the, proceedings, or, a, defense, in, flossenb, rg, concentration, camp, he, was, executed, there, by, hanging, at, dawn, on, 9, april, 1945, bonhoeffer, was, stripped, of, his, clothing, and, led, naked, into, the, execution, yard, where, he, was, hanged, with, five, others, canaris, general, hans, oster, canaris, s, deputy, general, karl, sack, a, military, jurist, businessman, theodor, str, nck, and, german, resistance, fighter, ludwig, gehre, eberhard, bethge, a, student, and, close, friend, of, bonhoeffer, writes, of, a, man, who, saw, the, execution, i, saw, pastor, bonhoeffer, kneeling, on, the, floor, praying, fervently, to, god, i, was, most, deeply, moved, by, the, way, this, lovable, man, prayed, so, devout, and, so, certain, that, god, heard, his, prayer, at, the, place, of, execution, he, again, said, a, short, prayer, and, then, climbed, the, few, steps, to, the, gallows, brave, and, composed, his, death, ensued, after, a, few, seconds, in, the, almost, fifty, years, that, i, worked, as, a, doctor, i, have, hardly, ever, seen, a, man, die, so, entirely, submissive, to, the, will, of, god, this, is, the, historical, account, of, bonhoeffer, s, death, which, over, the, decades, went, unchallenged, however, some, recent, biographers, see, problems, with, the, story, not, due, to, bethge, but, his, source, the, purported, witness, was, a, doctor, at, flossenb, rg, concentration, camp, hermann, fischer, h, llstrung, who, may, have, wished, to, minimize, the, suffering, of, the, condemned, men, to, reduce, his, own, culpability, in, their, executions, j, l, f, mogensen, a, former, prisoner, at, flossenb, rg, cited, the, length, of, time, it, took, for, the, execution, to, be, completed, almost, six, hours, plus, departures, from, camp, procedure, that, may, not, have, been, allowed, to, prisoners, so, late, in, the, war, as, jarring, inconsistencies, considering, that, the, sentences, had, been, confirmed, at, the, highest, levels, of, nazi, government, by, individuals, with, a, pattern, of, torturing, prisoners, who, dared, to, challenge, the, regime, craig, j, slane, posits, that, the, physical, details, of, bonhoeffer, s, death, may, have, been, much, more, difficult, than, we, earlier, had, imagined, other, recent, critics, of, the, traditional, account, are, more, caustic, one, terms, the, fischer, h, llstrung, story, as, unfortunately, a, lie, citing, additional, factual, inconsistencies, for, example, the, doctor, described, bonhoeffer, climbing, the, steps, to, be, hanged, but, at, flossenb, rg, the, outdoor, gallows, had, no, immediate, steps, it, also, appears, in, some, instances, that, fischer, h, llstrung, had, been, given, the, job, of, reviving, political, prisoners, after, they, had, been, hanged, until, they, were, almost, dead, in, order, to, prolong, the, agony, of, their, dying, another, critic, charges, that, fischer, h, llstrung, s, subsequent, statement, about, bonhoeffer, as, kneeling, in, wordy, prayer, belongs, to, the, realm, of, legend, although, without, evidence, to, the, contrary, the, disposition, of, bonhoeffer, s, remains, is, not, known, his, body, may, have, been, cremated, outside, the, camp, along, with, hundreds, of, other, recently, executed, or, dead, prisoners, or, american, troops, may, have, placed, his, body, in, one, of, several, mass, graves, in, which, they, interred, the, unburied, dead, of, the, camp, bonhoeffer, is, commemorated, in, the, liturgical, calendars, of, several, christian, denominations, on, the, anniversary, of, his, death, 9, april, this, includes, many, parts, of, the, anglican, communion, where, he, is, sometimes, identified, as, a, martyr, and, other, times, not, his, commemoration, in, the, liturgical, calendar, of, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, uses, the, liturgical, color, of, white, which, is, typically, used, for, non, martyred, saints, in, 2008, the, general, conference, of, the, united, methodist, church, which, does, not, enumerate, saints, officially, recognized, bonhoeffer, as, a, modern, day, martyr, he, was, the, first, martyr, to, be, so, recognized, who, lived, after, the, reformation, and, is, one, of, only, two, as, of, 2017, bonhoeffer, is, remembered, in, the, church, of, england, with, a, commemoration, on, 9, april, the, deutsche, evangelische, kirche, in, sydenham, london, at, which, he, preached, between, 1933, and, 1935, was, destroyed, by, bombing, in, 1944, a, replacement, church, was, built, in, 1958, and, named, dietrich, bonhoeffer, kirche, in, his, honor, dietrich, bonhoeffer, s, text, von, guten, m, chten, translated, as, by, gentle, or, by, gracious, powers, is, known, to, a, large, audience, as, a, worship, song, the, song, is, often, sung, at, funerals, in, 2021, it, was, voted, the, most, popular, hymn, in, germany, the, best, known, melody, was, written, by, siegfried, fietz, in, 1970, bonhoeffer, s, theology, is, subject, to, diverse, and, contradictory, interpretations, sometimes, necessarily, based, on, speculation, for, example, while, his, christocentric, approach, appeals, to, conservative, confession, minded, protestants, other, commentators, note, his, commitment, to, justice, and, ideas, about, religionless, christianity, he, also, argued, that, christians, should, not, retreat, from, the, world, but, act, within, it, he, believed, that, two, elements, were, constitutive, of, faith, the, implementation, of, justice, and, the, acceptance, of, divine, suffering, his, book, the, cost, of, discipleship, famously, discussed, the, concept, of, cheap, grace, against, costly, grace, he, contends, that, christians, have, relied, so, much, on, christ, s, forgiveness, that, they, do, not, challenge, themselves, enough, in, actually, following, his, word, to, their, best, ability, instead, relying, on, god, s, grace, to, save, them, when, they, fall, bonhoeffer, says, that, christians, are, instructed, to, strive, to, follow, the, word, of, god, only, then, after, they, strive, to, the, best, of, their, ability, should, god, s, grace, come, into, play, he, contrasts, cheap, grace, with, costly, grace, writing, cheap, grace, is, the, grace, we, bestow, on, ourselves, cheap, grace, is, the, preaching, of, forgiveness, without, requiring, repentance, baptism, without, church, discipline, communion, without, confession, absolution, without, personal, confession, cheap, grace, is, grace, without, discipleship, grace, without, the, cross, grace, without, jesus, christ, living, and, incarnate, costly, grace, is, the, gospel, which, must, be, sought, again, and, again, the, gift, which, must, be, asked, for, the, door, at, which, a, man, must, knock, such, grace, is, costly, because, it, calls, us, to, follow, and, it, is, grace, because, it, calls, us, to, follow, jesus, christ, it, is, costly, because, it, costs, a, man, his, life, and, it, is, grace, because, it, gives, a, man, the, only, true, life, it, is, costly, because, it, condemns, sin, and, grace, because, it, justifies, the, sinner, above, all, it, is, costly, because, it, cost, god, the, life, of, his, son, 47, 8, continuing, with, this, idea, bonhoeffer, discusses, the, idea, of, simple, obedience, he, admonishes, christians, who, come, too, quickly, to, the, conclusion, that, god, could, not, possibly, have, meant, his, commands, literally, 88, bonhoeffer, cites, the, example, of, the, rich, man, who, asks, jesus, how, he, can, enter, the, kingdom, of, heaven, he, writes, that, people, often, simply, assume, that, jesus, did, not, mean, literally, to, leave, everything, and, follow, him, and, that, instead, it, was, a, matter, of, faith, or, a, command, to, be, inwardly, detached, 87, 9, bonhoeffer, writes, that, god, says, exactly, what, he, means, and, that, christians, need, to, follow, simple, obedience, to, him, by, following, divine, commands, as, they, are, written, he, writes, that, only, he, who, believes, is, obedient, and, only, he, who, is, obedient, believes, 69, years, after, bonhoeffer, s, death, some, protestant, thinkers, such, as, richard, l, rubenstein, developed, his, critique, into, a, thoroughgoing, attack, against, traditional, christianity, in, the, death, of, god, movement, which, briefly, attracted, the, attention, of, the, mainstream, culture, in, the, mid, 1960s, however, some, critics, such, as, jacques, ellul, have, charged, that, those, radical, interpretations, of, bonhoeffer, s, insights, amount, to, a, grave, distortion, that, bonhoeffer, did, not, mean, to, say, that, god, no, longer, had, anything, to, do, with, humanity, and, had, become, a, mere, cultural, artifact, more, recent, bonhoeffer, interpretations, are, more, cautious, in, this, regard, respecting, the, parameters, of, the, neo, orthodox, school, to, which, he, belonged, bonhoeffer, also, influenced, the, comboni, missionary, father, ezechiele, ramin, english, translations, of, bonhoeffer, s, works, most, of, which, were, originally, written, in, german, are, available, many, of, his, lectures, and, books, were, translated, into, english, over, the, years, and, are, available, from, multiple, publishers, these, works, are, listed, following, the, fortress, press, edition, of,
