detroit, in, 1958, florence, ballard, a, junior, high, school, student, living, in, the, brewster, douglass, housing, projects, met, paul, williams, and, eddie, kendricks, who, were, two, members, of, a, detroit, singing, group, known, as, the, primes, ballard, sang, as, did, paul, williams, girlfriend, betty, mcglown, so, milton, jenkins, the, primes, s, manager, decided, to, create, a, sister, group, to, be, called, the, primettes, ballard, recruited, her, best, friend, mary, wilson, and, then, paul, williams, recruited, diana, ross, mentored, and, funded, by, jenkins, the, primettes, began, by, performing, hit, songs, of, artists, such, as, ray, charles, and, the, drifters, at, sock, hops, social, clubs, and, talent, shows, around, the, detroit, area, receiving, additional, guidance, from, group, friend, and, established, songwriter, jesse, greer, the, quartet, quickly, earned, a, local, fan, following, the, group, crafted, an, age, appropriate, style, that, was, inspired, by, the, collegiate, dress, of, popular, doo, wop, group, frankie, lymon, the, teenagers, for, the, most, part, ballard, ross, and, wilson, performed, equal, leads, on, songs, within, a, few, months, guitarist, marvin, tarplin, was, added, to, the, primettes, lineup, a, move, that, helped, distinguish, the, group, from, detroit, s, many, other, aspiring, acts, by, allowing, them, to, sing, live, instead, of, lip, synching, after, winning, the, windsor, detroit, international, freedom, festival, on, july, 4, 1960, the, primettes, sights, were, set, on, making, a, record, in, hopes, of, getting, the, group, signed, to, the, local, upstart, motown, label, in, 1960, ross, asked, an, old, neighbor, miracles, lead, singer, smokey, robinson, to, help, the, group, land, an, audition, for, motown, executive, berry, gordy, who, had, already, proven, himself, a, capable, songwriter, robinson, liked, the, girls, as, they, were, then, known, around, motown, and, agreed, to, help, but, he, liked, their, guitarist, even, more, with, the, primettes, permission, he, hired, tarplin, who, became, the, guitarist, for, the, miracles, robinson, arranged, for, the, primettes, to, audition, a, cappella, for, gordy, but, gordy, feeling, they, were, too, young, and, inexperienced, to, be, recording, artists, encouraged, them, to, return, when, they, had, graduated, from, high, school, undaunted, later, that, year, the, primettes, recorded, a, single, for, lu, pine, records, a, label, created, just, for, them, titled, tears, of, sorrow, which, was, backed, with, pretty, baby, the, single, failed, to, find, an, audience, however, shortly, thereafter, mcglown, became, engaged, and, left, the, group, barbara, martin, was, mcglown, s, prompt, replacement, determined, to, leave, an, impression, on, gordy, and, join, the, stable, of, rising, motown, stars, the, primettes, frequented, his, hitsville, u, s, a, recording, studio, eventually, they, convinced, gordy, to, allow, them, to, contribute, hand, claps, and, background, vocals, for, the, songs, of, other, motown, artists, including, marvin, gaye, and, mary, wells, in, january, 1961, gordy, finally, relented, and, agreed, to, sign, them, to, his, label, but, under, the, condition, that, they, change, the, name, of, their, group, the, primes, had, by, this, time, combined, with, otis, williams, the, distants, and, would, soon, sign, to, motown, as, the, temptations, gordy, gave, ballard, a, list, of, names, to, choose, from, that, included, suggestions, such, as, the, darleens, the, sweet, ps, the, melodees, the, royaltones, and, the, jewelettes, ballard, chose, another, suggestion, the, supremes, in, the, spring, of, 1962, martin, left, the, group, to, start, a, family, thus, the, newly, named, supremes, continued, as, a, trio, between, 1961, and, 1963, the, supremes, released, six, singles, starting, with, i, want, a, guy, and, buttered, popcorn, on, motown, subsidiary, label, tamla, however, none, of, those, first, six, singles, charted, in, the, top, 40, positions, of, the, billboard, hot, 100, jokingly, referred, to, as, the, no, hit, supremes, around, motown, s, hitsville, u, s, a, offices, the, group, attempted, to, compensate, for, their, lack, of, hits, by, taking, on, any, work, available, at, the, studio, including, providing, hand, claps, and, singing, backup, for, motown, artists, such, as, marvin, gaye, and, the, temptations, during, these, years, all, three, members, took, turns, singing, lead, wilson, favored, soft, ballads, ballard, favored, soulful, hard, driving, songs, and, ross, favored, mainstream, pop, songs, most, of, their, early, material, was, written, and, produced, by, berry, gordy, or, smokey, robinson, in, december, 1963, the, single, when, the, lovelight, starts, shining, through, his, eyes, peaked, at, number, 23, on, the, billboard, hot, 100, lovelight, was, the, first, of, many, supremes, songs, written, by, the, motown, songwriting, and, production, team, known, as, holland, dozier, holland, in, late, 1963, berry, gordy, chose, diane, ross, who, began, going, by, diana, in, 1965, as, the, official, lead, singer, of, the, group, ballard, and, wilson, were, periodically, given, solos, on, supremes, albums, and, ballard, continued, to, sing, her, solo, number, people, in, concert, for, the, next, two, years, in, the, spring, of, 1964, the, supremes, recorded, the, single, where, did, our, love, go, the, song, was, originally, intended, by, holland, dozier, holland, for, the, marvelettes, who, rejected, it, although, the, supremes, disliked, the, song, the, producers, coerced, them, into, recording, it, in, august, 1964, while, the, supremes, toured, as, part, of, dick, clark, s, caravan, of, stars, where, did, our, love, go, reached, number, one, on, the, us, pop, charts, much, to, the, surprise, and, delight, of, the, group, it, was, also, their, first, song, to, appear, on, the, uk, singles, chart, where, it, reached, number, three, where, did, our, love, go, was, followed, by, four, consecutive, us, number, one, hits, baby, love, which, was, also, a, number, one, hit, in, the, uk, come, see, about, me, stop, in, the, name, of, love, and, back, in, my, arms, again, baby, love, was, nominated, for, the, 1965, grammy, award, for, best, r, b, song, the, supremes, deliberately, embraced, a, more, glamorous, image, than, previous, black, performers, much, of, this, was, accomplished, at, the, behest, of, motown, chief, berry, gordy, and, maxine, powell, who, ran, motown, s, in, house, finishing, school, and, artist, development, department, unlike, many, of, her, contemporaries, ross, sang, in, a, thin, calm, voice, and, her, vocal, styling, was, matched, by, having, all, three, women, embellish, their, femininity, instead, of, imitate, the, qualities, of, male, groups, eschewing, plain, appearances, and, basic, dance, routines, the, supremes, appeared, onstage, in, detailed, make, up, and, high, fashion, gowns, and, wigs, and, performed, graceful, choreography, created, by, motown, choreographer, cholly, atkins, powell, told, the, group, to, be, prepared, to, perform, before, kings, and, queens, gordy, wanted, the, supremes, like, all, of, his, performers, to, be, equally, appealing, to, black, and, white, audiences, publications, such, as, time, and, the, detroit, news, commented, on, the, supremes, polished, presentation, in, a, may, 1965, profile, of, rock, music, time, called, the, supremes, the, reigning, female, rock, n, roll, group, and, said, that, ross, is, greatly, envied, for, the, torchy, come, hither, purr, in, her, voice, arnold, s, hirsch, of, the, detroit, news, said, about, the, supremes, they, don, t, scream, or, wail, incoherently, an, adult, can, understand, nine, out, of, every, 10, words, they, sing, and, most, astounding, melody, can, be, clearly, detected, in, every, song, encyclopedia, britannica, commented, that, the, supremes, hit, singles, sounded, modern, upwardly, mobile, and, stylishly, sensual, in, a, way, that, appealed, equally, to, adults, and, teens, of, all, persuasions, by, 1965, the, supremes, were, international, stars, they, toured, the, world, becoming, almost, as, popular, abroad, as, they, were, in, the, us, almost, immediately, after, their, initial, number, one, hits, they, recorded, songs, for, motion, picture, soundtracks, appeared, in, the, 1965, film, beach, ball, and, endorsed, dozens, of, products, at, one, point, having, their, own, brand, of, bread, by, the, end, of, 1966, their, number, one, hits, included, i, hear, a, symphony, you, can, t, hurry, love, and, you, keep, me, hangin, on, that, year, the, group, also, released, the, supremes, a, go, go, which, on, october, 22, became, the, first, album, by, an, all, female, group, to, reach, number, one, on, the, us, billboard, 200, knocking, the, beatles, revolver, out, of, the, top, spot, because, the, supremes, were, popular, with, white, audiences, as, well, as, with, black, ones, gordy, had, the, group, perform, at, renowned, supper, clubs, such, as, the, copacabana, in, new, york, broadway, and, pop, standards, were, incorporated, into, their, repertoire, alongside, their, own, hit, songs, as, a, result, the, supremes, became, one, of, the, first, black, musical, acts, to, achieve, complete, and, sustained, crossover, success, black, rock, and, roll, musicians, of, the, 1950s, had, seen, many, of, their, original, hit, tunes, covered, by, white, musicians, with, these, covers, usually, achieving, more, fame, and, sales, success, than, the, originals, the, supremes, success, however, counteracted, this, trend, featuring, three, group, members, who, were, marketed, for, their, individual, personalities, a, move, unprecedented, at, the, time, and, diana, ross, s, pop, friendly, voice, the, supremes, broke, down, racial, barriers, with, rock, and, roll, songs, underpinned, by, r, b, stylings, the, group, became, extremely, popular, both, domestically, and, abroad, becoming, one, of, the, first, black, musical, acts, to, appear, regularly, on, television, programs, such, as, hullabaloo, the, hollywood, palace, the, della, reese, show, and, most, notably, the, ed, sullivan, show, on, which, they, made, 17, appearances, in, 2003, fred, bronson, wrote, that, in, 1959, when, the, supremes, formed, as, the, primettes, no, one, could, have, predicted, they, would, become, the, most, successful, american, singing, group, of, all, time, problems, within, the, group, and, within, motown, records, stable, of, performers, led, to, tension, among, the, members, of, the, supremes, many, of, the, other, motown, performers, felt, that, berry, gordy, was, lavishing, too, much, attention, upon, the, group, and, upon, ross, in, particular, in, early, 1967, the, name, of, the, act, was, officially, changed, briefly, to, the, supremes, with, diana, ross, before, changing, again, to, diana, ross, the, supremes, by, mid, summer, the, miracles, had, become, smokey, robinson, the, miracles, two, years, prior, the, fall, of, 1967, saw, martha, the, vandellas, become, martha, reeves, the, vandellas, having, learned, that, ross, would, receive, top, billing, david, ruffin, lobbied, unsuccessfully, to, have, the, temptations, renamed, as, david, ruffin, the, temptations, although, gordy, maintained, that, because, they, would, be, providing, two, acts, a, lead, singer, and, a, group, motown, could, demand, more, money, for, live, bookings, the, supremes, name, change, fueled, already, present, rumors, of, a, solo, career, for, ross, and, contributed, to, the, professional, and, personal, dismantling, of, the, group, in, fact, gordy, intended, to, replace, ross, with, barbara, randolph, as, early, as, the, fall, of, 1966, but, changed, his, mind, and, instead, kept, ross, in, the, group, for, several, more, years, as, ross, became, the, focal, point, of, the, supremes, ballard, suffered, from, depression, and, began, to, drink, excessively, gaining, weight, until, she, could, no, longer, comfortably, wear, many, of, her, stage, outfits, during, this, turbulent, period, ballard, relied, heavily, upon, the, advice, of, group, mate, mary, wilson, with, whom, she, had, maintained, a, close, friendship, wilson, while, outwardly, demure, and, neutral, in, hopes, of, keeping, the, group, stable, privately, advised, ballard, that, ross, and, gordy, were, eager, to, oust, ballard, by, 1967, ballard, would, not, show, up, for, recording, dates, or, would, arrive, at, shows, too, inebriated, to, perform, for, some, early, 1967, shows, she, was, replaced, by, marlene, barrow, a, member, of, the, motown, backup, group, the, andantes, looking, for, a, more, permanent, replacement, gordy, once, again, thought, of, barbara, randolph, possibly, believing, that, randolph, could, be, groomed, as, lead, singer, for, the, group, once, it, was, decided, to, take, ross, solo, however, ross, did, not, receive, randolph, well, in, april, 1967, gordy, then, contacted, cindy, birdsong, a, member, of, patti, labelle, the, blue, belles, who, superficially, resembled, ballard, with, plans, to, bring, her, in, as, ballard, s, replacement, he, made, his, plans, clear, to, ballard, and, her, group, mates, at, a, mid, april, meeting, and, birdsong, was, brought, in, to, begin, rehearsals, gordy, did, not, fire, ballard, outright, at, that, time, asking, ballard, instead, to, quit, on, her, own, birdsong, first, appeared, with, the, supremes, in, ballard, s, place, at, a, benefit, concert, at, the, hollywood, bowl, on, april, 29, 1967, following, the, performance, gordy, quickly, learned, that, birdsong, was, still, contractually, committed, to, the, blue, belles, when, that, group, s, lawyers, filed, an, injunction, against, him, in, may, ballard, returned, for, what, she, believed, was, a, probationary, period, although, in, reality, it, was, a, stopgap, measure, until, gordy, was, able, to, buy, out, birdsong, s, contract, during, may, and, june, knowing, that, she, was, one, step, away, from, being, dismissed, ballard, made, an, attempt, to, toe, the, line, slimming, down, and, showing, up, to, commitments, on, time, and, sober, despite, this, birdsong, was, secretly, traveling, with, the, supremes, studying, their, routines, on, june, 29, 1967, the, group, returned, to, the, flamingo, hotel, in, las, vegas, as, diana, ross, the, supremes, the, first, two, days, of, the, flamingo, engagement, went, by, smoothly, on, july, 1, when, reporting, for, makeup, and, wardrobe, before, their, first, show, of, the, evening, ballard, discovered, an, extra, set, of, gowns, and, costumes, that, had, been, brought, along, for, cindy, birdsong, angered, ballard, performed, the, first, concert, of, the, night, inebriated, leading, to, an, embarrassing, on, stage, incident, in, which, her, stomach, was, revealed, when, she, purposely, thrust, it, forward, during, a, dance, routine, enraged, gordy, ordered, her, back, to, detroit, and, permanently, dismissed, her, from, the, group, birdsong, officially, assumed, her, place, during, the, second, july, 1, show, ballard, s, release, from, motown, was, made, final, on, february, 22, 1968, when, she, received, a, one, time, payment, of, us, 139, 804, 94, in, royalties, and, earnings, she, attempted, a, solo, career, with, abc, records, and, was, forced, to, formally, reject, a, solo, contract, offered, by, motown, as, part, of, her, settlement, ballard, s, two, 1968, singles, failed, to, chart, and, her, solo, album, was, shelved, in, 1971, ballard, sued, motown, for, 8, 7, million, claiming, that, gordy, and, diana, ross, had, conspired, to, force, her, out, of, the, group, the, judge, ruled, in, favor, of, motown, ballard, eventually, sank, into, poverty, and, died, abruptly, on, february, 22, 1976, from, an, cardiac, arrest, caused, by, a, coronary, thrombosis, at, the, age, of, 32, holland, dozier, holland, left, motown, in, early, 1968, after, a, dispute, with, the, label, over, royalties, and, profit, sharing,

tension, within, the, group, and, stringent, touring, schedules, neither, mary, wilson, nor, cindy, birdsong, appear, on, many, of, these, singles, they, were, replaced, on, these, recordings, by, session, singers, such, as, the, andantes, the, changes, within, the, group, and, their, decreasing, sales, were, signs, of, changes, within, the, music, industry, the, gospel, based, soul, of, female, performers, such, as, aretha, franklin, had, eclipsed, the, supremes, pop, based, sound, which, had, by, now, evolved, to, include, more, middle, of, the, road, material, in, a, cultural, climate, now, influenced, more, than, ever, by, countercultural, movements, such, as, the, black, panther, party, the, supremes, found, themselves, attacked, for, not, being, black, enough, and, lost, ground, in, the, black, music, market, in, mid, 1968, motown, initiated, a, number, of, high, profile, collaborations, for, the, supremes, with, their, old, colleagues, the, temptations, besides, the,
