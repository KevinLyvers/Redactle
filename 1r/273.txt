significant, philosophers, of, the, french, renaissance, he, is, known, for, popularizing, the, essay, as, a, literary, genre, his, work, is, noted, for, its, merging, of, casual, anecdotes, and, autobiography, with, intellectual, insight, montaigne, had, a, direct, influence, on, numerous, western, writers, his, massive, volume, essais, contains, some, of, the, most, influential, essays, ever, written, during, his, lifetime, montaigne, was, admired, more, as, a, statesman, than, as, an, author, the, tendency, in, his, essays, to, digress, into, anecdotes, and, personal, ruminations, was, seen, as, detrimental, to, proper, style, rather, than, as, an, innovation, and, his, declaration, that, i, am, myself, the, matter, of, my, book, was, viewed, by, his, contemporaries, as, self, indulgent, in, time, however, montaigne, came, to, be, recognized, as, embodying, perhaps, better, than, any, other, author, of, his, time, the, spirit, of, freely, entertaining, doubt, that, began, to, emerge, at, that, time, he, is, most, famously, known, for, his, skeptical, remark, que, s, ay, je, what, do, i, know, in, middle, french, now, rendered, as, que, sais, je, in, modern, french, montaigne, was, born, in, the, guyenne, aquitaine, region, of, france, on, the, family, estate, ch, teau, de, montaigne, in, a, town, now, called, saint, michel, de, montaigne, close, to, bordeaux, the, family, was, very, wealthy, his, great, grandfather, ramon, felipe, eyquem, had, made, a, fortune, as, a, herring, merchant, and, had, bought, the, estate, in, 1477, thus, becoming, the, lord, of, montaigne, his, father, pierre, eyquem, seigneur, of, montaigne, was, a, french, catholic, soldier, in, italy, for, a, time, and, had, also, been, the, mayor, of, bordeaux, although, there, were, several, families, bearing, the, patronym, eyquem, in, guyenne, his, father, s, family, is, thought, to, have, had, some, degree, of, marrano, spanish, and, portuguese, jewish, origins, while, his, mother, antoinette, l, pez, de, villanueva, was, a, convert, to, protestantism, his, maternal, grandfather, pedro, l, pez, from, zaragoza, was, from, a, wealthy, marrano, sephardic, jewish, family, that, had, converted, to, catholicism, his, maternal, grandmother, honorette, dupuy, was, from, a, catholic, family, in, gascony, france, during, a, great, part, of, montaigne, s, life, his, mother, lived, near, him, and, even, survived, him, but, she, is, mentioned, only, twice, in, his, essays, montaigne, s, relationship, with, his, father, however, is, frequently, reflected, upon, and, discussed, in, his, essays, montaigne, s, education, began, in, early, childhood, and, followed, a, pedagogical, plan, that, his, father, had, developed, refined, by, the, advice, of, the, latter, s, humanist, friends, soon, after, his, birth, montaigne, was, brought, to, a, small, cottage, where, he, lived, the, first, three, years, of, life, in, the, sole, company, of, a, peasant, family, in, order, to, according, to, the, elder, montaigne, draw, the, boy, close, to, the, people, and, to, the, life, conditions, of, the, people, who, need, our, help, after, these, first, spartan, years, montaigne, was, brought, back, to, the, ch, teau, another, objective, was, for, latin, to, become, his, first, language, the, intellectual, education, of, montaigne, was, assigned, to, a, german, tutor, a, doctor, named, horstanus, who, could, not, speak, french, his, father, hired, only, servants, who, could, speak, latin, and, they, also, were, given, strict, orders, always, to, speak, to, the, boy, in, latin, the, same, rule, applied, to, his, mother, father, and, servants, who, were, obliged, to, use, only, latin, words, he, employed, and, thus, they, acquired, a, knowledge, of, the, very, language, his, tutor, taught, him, montaigne, s, latin, education, was, accompanied, by, constant, intellectual, and, spiritual, stimulation, he, was, familiarized, with, greek, by, a, pedagogical, method, that, employed, games, conversation, and, exercises, of, solitary, meditation, rather, than, the, more, traditional, books, the, atmosphere, of, the, boy, s, upbringing, engendered, in, him, a, spirit, of, liberty, and, delight, that, he, would, later, describe, as, making, him, relish, duty, by, an, unforced, will, and, of, my, own, voluntary, motion, without, any, severity, or, constraint, his, father, had, a, musician, wake, him, every, morning, playing, one, instrument, or, another, and, an, epinettier, with, a, zither, was, the, constant, companion, to, montaigne, and, his, tutor, playing, tunes, to, alleviate, boredom, and, tiredness, around, the, year, 1539, montaigne, was, sent, to, study, at, a, highly, regarded, boarding, school, in, bordeaux, the, college, of, guienne, then, under, the, direction, of, the, greatest, latin, scholar, of, the, era, george, buchanan, where, he, mastered, the, whole, curriculum, by, his, thirteenth, year, he, finished, the, first, phase, of, his, educational, studies, at, the, college, of, guienne, in, 1546, he, then, began, his, study, of, law, his, alma, mater, remains, unknown, since, there, are, no, certainties, about, his, activity, from, 1546, to, 1557, and, entered, a, career, in, the, local, legal, system, montaigne, was, a, counselor, of, the, court, des, aides, of, p, rigueux, and, in, 1557, he, was, appointed, counselor, of, the, parlement, in, bordeaux, a, high, court, from, 1561, to, 1563, he, was, courtier, at, the, court, of, charles, ix, and, he, was, present, with, the, king, at, the, siege, of, rouen, 1562, he, was, awarded, the, highest, honour, of, the, french, nobility, the, collar, of, the, order, of, saint, michael, while, serving, at, the, bordeaux, parlement, he, became, a, very, close, friend, of, the, humanist, poet, tienne, de, la, bo, tie, whose, death, in, 1563, deeply, affected, montaigne, it, has, been, suggested, by, donald, m, frame, in, his, introduction, to, the, complete, essays, of, montaigne, that, because, of, montaigne, s, imperious, need, to, communicate, after, losing, tienne, he, began, the, essais, as, a, new, means, of, communication, and, that, the, reader, takes, the, place, of, the, dead, friend, montaigne, married, fran, oise, de, la, cassaigne, in, 1565, probably, in, an, arranged, marriage, she, was, the, daughter, and, niece, of, wealthy, merchants, of, toulouse, and, bordeaux, they, had, six, daughters, but, only, the, second, born, l, onor, survived, infancy, he, wrote, very, little, about, the, relationship, with, his, wife, and, little, is, known, about, their, marriage, of, his, daughter, l, onor, he, wrote, all, my, children, die, at, nurse, but, l, onore, our, only, daughter, who, has, escaped, this, misfortune, has, reached, the, age, of, six, and, more, without, having, been, punished, the, indulgence, of, her, mother, aiding, except, in, words, and, those, very, gentle, ones, his, daughter, married, fran, ois, de, la, tour, and, later, charles, de, gamaches, she, had, a, daughter, by, each, following, the, petition, of, his, father, montaigne, started, to, work, on, the, first, translation, of, the, catalan, monk, raymond, sebond, s, theologia, naturalis, which, he, published, a, year, after, his, father, s, death, in, 1568, in, 1595, sebond, s, prologue, was, put, on, the, index, librorum, prohibitorum, because, of, its, declaration, that, the, bible, is, not, the, only, source, of, revealed, truth, montaigne, also, published, a, posthumous, edition, of, the, works, of, his, friend, bo, tie, in, 1570, he, moved, back, to, the, family, estate, the, ch, teau, de, montaigne, which, he, had, inherited, he, thus, became, the, lord, of, montaigne, around, this, time, he, was, seriously, injured, in, a, riding, accident, on, the, grounds, of, the, ch, teau, when, one, of, his, mounted, companions, collided, with, him, at, speed, throwing, montaigne, from, his, horse, and, briefly, knocking, him, unconscious, it, took, weeks, or, months, for, him, to, recover, and, this, close, brush, with, death, apparently, affected, him, greatly, as, he, discussed, it, at, length, in, his, writings, over, the, following, years, not, long, after, the, accident, he, relinquished, his, magistracy, in, bordeaux, his, first, child, was, born, and, died, a, few, months, later, and, by, 1571, he, had, retired, from, public, life, completely, to, the, tower, of, the, ch, teau, his, so, called, citadel, where, he, almost, totally, isolated, himself, from, every, social, and, family, affair, locked, up, in, his, library, which, contained, a, collection, of, some, 1, 500, volumes, he, began, work, on, the, writings, that, would, later, be, compiled, into, his, essais, essays, first, published, in, 1580, on, the, day, of, his, 38th, birthday, as, he, entered, this, almost, ten, year, period, of, self, imposed, reclusion, he, had, the, following, inscription, placed, on, the, crown, of, the, bookshelves, of, his, working, chamber, in, the, year, of, christ, 1571, at, the, age, of, thirty, eight, on, the, last, day, of, february, his, birthday, michael, de, montaigne, long, weary, of, the, servitude, of, the, court, and, of, public, employments, while, still, entire, retired, to, the, bosom, of, the, learned, virgins, where, in, calm, and, freedom, from, all, cares, he, will, spend, what, little, remains, of, his, life, now, more, than, half, run, out, if, the, fates, permit, he, will, complete, this, abode, this, sweet, ancestral, retreat, and, he, has, consecrated, it, to, his, freedom, tranquility, and, leisure, during, this, time, of, the, wars, of, religion, in, france, montaigne, a, roman, catholic, acted, as, a, moderating, force, respected, both, by, the, catholic, king, henry, iii, and, the, protestant, henry, of, navarre, who, later, converted, to, catholicism, in, 1578, montaigne, whose, health, had, always, been, excellent, started, suffering, from, painful, kidney, stones, a, tendency, he, inherited, from, his, father, s, family, throughout, this, illness, he, would, have, nothing, to, do, with, doctors, or, drugs, from, 1580, to, 1581, montaigne, traveled, in, france, germany, austria, switzerland, and, italy, partly, in, search, of, a, cure, establishing, himself, at, bagni, di, lucca, where, he, took, the, waters, his, journey, was, also, a, pilgrimage, to, the, holy, house, of, loreto, to, which, he, presented, a, silver, relief, depicting, him, his, wife, and, their, daughter, kneeling, before, the, madonna, considering, himself, fortunate, that, it, should, be, hung, on, a, wall, within, the, shrine, he, kept, a, journal, recording, regional, differences, and, customs, and, a, variety, of, personal, episodes, including, the, dimensions, of, the, stones, he, succeeded, in, expelling, this, was, published, much, later, in, 1774, after, its, discovery, in, a, trunk, that, is, displayed, in, his, tower, during, a, visit, to, the, vatican, that, montaigne, described, in, his, travel, journal, the, essais, were, examined, by, sisto, fabri, who, served, as, master, of, the, sacred, palace, under, pope, gregory, xiii, after, fabri, examined, montaigne, s, essais, the, text, was, returned, to, him, on, 20, march, 1581, montaigne, had, apologized, for, references, to, the, pagan, notion, of, fortuna, as, well, as, for, writing, favorably, of, julian, the, apostate, and, of, heretical, poets, and, was, released, to, follow, his, own, conscience, in, making, emendations, to, the, text, while, in, the, city, of, lucca, in, 1581, he, learned, that, like, his, father, before, him, he, had, been, elected, mayor, of, bordeaux, he, thus, returned, and, served, as, mayor, he, was, re, elected, in, 1583, and, served, until, 1585, again, moderating, between, catholics, and, protestants, the, plague, broke, out, in, bordeaux, toward, the, end, of, his, second, term, in, office, in, 1585, in, 1586, the, plague, and, the, french, wars, of, religion, prompted, him, to, leave, his, ch, teau, for, two, years, montaigne, continued, to, extend, revise, and, oversee, the, publication, of, the, essais, in, 1588, he, wrote, its, third, book, and, also, met, marie, de, gournay, an, author, who, admired, his, work, and, later, edited, and, published, it, montaigne, later, referred, to, her, as, his, adopted, daughter, when, king, henry, iii, was, assassinated, in, 1589, montaigne, despite, his, aversion, to, the, cause, of, the, reformation, was, anxious, to, promote, a, compromise, that, would, end, the, bloodshed, and, gave, his, support, to, henry, of, navarre, who, would, go, on, to, become, king, henry, iv, montaigne, s, position, associated, him, with, the, politiques, the, establishment, movement, that, prioritised, peace, national, unity, and, royal, authority, over, religious, allegiance, montaigne, died, of, quinsy, at, the, age, of, 59, in, 1592, at, the, ch, teau, de, montaigne, in, his, case, the, disease, brought, about, paralysis, of, the, tongue, especially, difficult, for, one, who, once, said, the, most, fruitful, and, natural, play, of, the, mind, is, conversation, i, find, it, sweeter, than, any, other, action, in, life, and, if, i, were, forced, to, choose, i, think, i, would, rather, lose, my, sight, than, my, hearing, and, voice, remaining, in, possession, of, all, his, other, faculties, he, requested, mass, and, died, during, the, celebration, of, that, mass, he, was, buried, nearby, later, his, remains, were, moved, to, the, church, of, saint, antoine, at, bordeaux, the, church, no, longer, exists, it, became, the, convent, des, feuillants, which, also, has, disappeared, his, humanism, finds, expression, in, his, essais, a, collection, of, a, large, number, of, short, subjective, essays, on, various, topics, published, in, 1580, that, were, inspired, by, his, studies, in, the, classics, especially, by, the, works, of, plutarch, and, lucretius, montaigne, s, stated, goal, was, to, describe, humans, and, especially, himself, with, utter, frankness, inspired, by, his, consideration, of, the, lives, and, ideals, of, the, leading, figures, of, his, age, he, finds, the, great, variety, and, volatility, of, human, nature, to, be, its, most, basic, features, he, describes, his, own, poor, memory, his, ability, to, solve, problems, and, mediate, conflicts, without, truly, getting, emotionally, involved, his, disdain, for, the, human, pursuit, of, lasting, fame, and, his, attempts, to, detach, himself, from, worldly, things, to, prepare, for, his, timely, death, he, writes, about, his, disgust, with, the, religious, conflicts, of, his, time, he, believed, that, humans, are, not, able, to, attain, true, certainty, the, longest, of, his, essays, apology, for, raymond, sebond, marking, his, adoption, of, pyrrhonism, contains, his, famous, motto, what, do, i, know, montaigne, considered, marriage, necessary, for, the, raising, of, children, but, disliked, strong, feelings, of, passionate, love, because, he, saw, them, as, detrimental, to, freedom, in, education, he, favored, concrete, examples, and, experience, over, the, teaching, of, abstract, knowledge, intended, to, be, accepted, uncritically, his, essay, on, the, education, of, children, is, dedicated, to, diana, of, foix, the, essais, exercised, an, important, influence, on, both, french, and, english, literature, in, thought, and, style, francis, bacon, s, essays, published, over, a, decade, later, first, in, 1597, usually, are, presumed, to, be, directly, influenced, by, montaigne, s, collection, and, montaigne, is, cited, by, bacon, alongside, other, classical, sources, in, later, essays, although, not, a, scientist, montaigne, made, observations, on, topics, in, psychology, in, his, essays, he, developed, and, explained, his, observations, of, these, themes, his, thoughts, and, ideas, covered, subjects, such, as, thought, motivation, fear, happiness, child, education, experience, and, human, action, montaigne, s, ideas, have, influenced, psychology, and, are, a, part, of, its, rich, history, child, education, was, among, the, psychological, topics, that, he, wrote, about, his, essays, on, the, education, of, children, on, pedantry, and, on, experience, explain, the, views, he, had, on, child, education, 61, 62, 70, some, of, his, views, on, child, education, are, still, relevant, today, montaigne, s, views, on, the, education, of, children, were, opposed, to, the, common, educational, practices, of, his, day, 63, 67, he, found, fault, both, with, what, was, taught, and, how, it, was, taught, 62, much, of, education, during, montaigne, s, time, focused, on, reading, the, classics, and, learning, through, books, 67, montaigne, disagreed, with, learning, strictly, through, books, he, believed, it, was, necessary, to, educate, children, in, a, variety, of, ways, he, also, disagreed, with, the, way, information, was, being, presented, to, students, it, was, being, presented, in, a, way, that, encouraged, students, to, take, the, information, that, was, taught, to, them, as, absolute, truth, students, were, denied, the, chance, to, question, the, information, but, montaigne, in, general, took, the, position, that, to, learn, truly, a, student, had, to, take, the, information, and, make, it, their, own, let, the, tutor, make, his, charge, pass, everything, through, a, sieve, and, lodge, nothing, in, his, head, on, mere, authority, and, trust, let, not, aristotle, s, principles, be, principles, to, him, any, more, than, those, of, the, stoics, or, epicureans, let, this, variety, of, ideas, be, set, before, him, he, will, choose, if, he, can, if, not, he, will, remain, in, doubt, only, the, fools, are, certain, and, assured, for, doubting, pleases, me, no, less, than, knowing, for, if, he, embraces, xenophon, s, and, plato, s, opinions, by, his, own, reasoning, they, will, no, longer, be, theirs, they, will, be, his, he, who, follows, another, follows, nothing, he, finds, nothing, indeed, he, seeks, nothing, we, are, not, under, a, king, let, each, one, claim, his, own, freedom, he, must, imbibe, their, way, of, thinking, not, learn, their, precepts, and, let, him, boldly, forget, if, he, wants, where, he, got, them, but, let, him, know, how, to, make, them, his, own, truth, and, reason, are, common, to, everyone, and, no, more, belong, to, the, man, who, first, spoke, them, than, to, the, man, who, says, them, later, it, is, no, more, according, to, plato, than, according, to, me, since, he, and, i, see, it, in, the, same, way, the, bees, plunder, the, flowers, here, and, there, but, afterward, they, make, of, them, honey, which, is, all, and, purely, their, own, and, no, longer, thyme, and, marjoram, at, the, foundation, montaigne, believed, that, the, selection, of, a, good, tutor, was, important, for, the, student, to, become, well, educated, 66, education, by, a, tutor, was, to, be, conducted, at, the, pace, of, the, student, 67, he, believed, that, a, tutor, should, be, in, dialogue, with, the, student, letting, the, student, speak, first, the, tutor, also, should, allow, for, discussions, and, debates, to, be, had, such, a, dialogue, was, intended, to, create, an, environment, in, which, students, would, teach, themselves, they, would, be, able, to, realize, their, mistakes, and, make, corrections, to, them, as, necessary, individualized, learning, was, integral, to, his, theory, of, child, education, he, argued, that, the, student, combines, information, already, known, with, what, is, learned, and, forms, a, unique, perspective, on, the, newly, learned, information, 356, montaigne, also, thought, that, tutors, should, encourage, the, natural, curiosity, of, students, and, allow, them, to, question, things, 68, he, postulated, that, successful, students, were, those, who, were, encouraged, to, question, new, information, and, study, it, for, themselves, rather, than, simply, accepting, what, they, had, heard, from, the, authorities, on, any, given, topic, montaigne, believed, that, a, child, s, curiosity, could, serve, as, an, important, teaching, tool, when, the, child, is, allowed, to, explore, the, things, that, the, child, is, curious, about, experience, also, was, a, key, element, to, learning, for, montaigne, tutors, needed, to, teach, students, through, experience, rather, than, through, the, mere, memorization, of, information, often, practised, in, book, learning, 62, 67, he, argued, that, students, would, become, passive, adults, blindly, obeying, and, lacking, the, ability, to, think, on, their, own, 354, nothing, of, importance, would, be, retained, and, no, abilities, would, be, learned, 62, he, believed, that, learning, through, experience, was, superior, to, learning, through, the, use, of, books, for, this, reason, he, encouraged, tutors, to, educate, their, students, through, practice, travel, and, human, interaction, in, doing, so, he, argued, that, students, would, become, active, learners, who, could, claim, knowledge, for, themselves, montaigne, s, views, on, child, education, continue, to, have, an, influence, in, the, present, variations, of, montaigne, s, ideas, on, education, are, incorporated, into, modern, learning, in, some, ways, he, argued, against, the, popular, way, of, teaching, in, his, day, encouraging, individualized, learning, he, believed, in, the, importance, of, experience, over, book, learning, and, memorization, ultimately, montaigne, postulated, that, the, point, of, education, was, to, teach, a, student, how, to, have, a, successful, life, by, practising, an, active, and, socially, interactive, lifestyle, 355, thinkers, exploring, ideas, similar, to, montaigne, include, erasmus, thomas, more, john, fisher, and, guillaume, bud, who, all, worked, about, fifty, years, before, montaigne, many, of, montaigne, s, latin, quotations, are, from, erasmus, adagia, and, most, critically, all, of, his, quotations, from, socrates, plutarch, remains, perhaps, montaigne, s, strongest, influence, in, terms, of, substance, and, style, montaigne, s, quotations, from, plutarch, in, the, essays, number, more, than, 500, ever, since, edward, capell, first, made, the, suggestion, in, 1780, scholars, have, suggested, montaigne, to, be, an, influence, on, shakespeare, the, latter, would, have, had, access, to, john, florio, s, translation, of, montaigne, s, essais, published, in, english, in, 1603, and, a, scene, in, the, tempest, follows, the, wording, of, florio, so, closely, that, his, indebtedness, is, unmistakable, most, parallels, between, the, two, may, be, explained, however, as, commonplaces, as, similarities, with, writers, in, other, nations, to, the, works, of, cervantes, and, shakespeare, could, be, due, simply, to, their, own, study, of, latin, moral, and, philosophical, writers, such, as, seneca, the, younger, horace, ovid, and, virgil, much, of, blaise, pascal, s, skepticism, in, his, pens, es, has, been, attributed, traditionally, to, his, reading, montaigne, the, english, essayist, william, hazlitt, expressed, boundless, admiration, for, montaigne, exclaiming, that, he, was, the, first, who, had, the, courage, to, say, as, an, author, what, he, felt, as, a, man, he, was, neither, a, pedant, nor, a, bigot, in, treating, of, men, and, manners, he, spoke, of, them, as, he, found, them, not, according, to, preconceived, notions, and, abstract, dogmas, beginning, most, overtly, with, the, essays, in, the, familiar, style, in, his, own, table, talk, hazlitt, tried, to, follow, montaigne, s, example, ralph, waldo, emerson, chose, montaigne, or, the, skeptic, as, a, subject, of, one, of, his, series, of, lectures, entitled, representative, men, alongside, other, subjects, such, as, shakespeare, and, plato, in, the, skeptic, emerson, writes, of, his, experience, reading, montaigne, it, seemed, to, me, as, if, i, had, myself, written, the, book, in, some, former, life, so, sincerely, it, spoke, to, my, thought, and, experience, friedrich, nietzsche, judged, of, montaigne, that, such, a, man, wrote, has, truly, augmented, the, joy, of, living, on, this, earth, sainte, beuve, advises, us, that, to, restore, lucidity, and, proportion, to, our, judgments, let, us, read, every, evening, a, page, of, montaigne, stefan, zweig, drew, inspiration, from, one, of, montaigne, s, quotes, to, give, the, title, to, one, of, his, autobiographical, novels, a, conscience, against, violence, the, american, philosopher, eric, hoffer, employed, montaigne, both, stylistically, and, in, thought, in, hoffer,
