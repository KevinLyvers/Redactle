and, gedei, khan, subutai, ultimately, directed, more, than, 20, campaigns, and, won, 65, pitched, battles, during, which, he, conquered, or, overran, more, territory, than, any, other, commander, in, history, as, part, of, the, expansion, of, the, mongol, empire, the, largest, contiguous, empire, in, human, history, he, often, gained, victory, by, means, of, sophisticated, strategies, and, routinely, coordinated, movements, of, armies, that, operated, hundreds, of, kilometers, apart, from, each, other, subutai, is, known, for, the, geographical, diversity, and, success, of, his, expeditions, which, took, him, from, central, asia, to, the, russian, steppe, and, into, europe, subutai, is, regarded, by, many, as, the, single, greatest, military, commander, in, history, instrumental, in, the, conquests, of, genghis, and, gedei, khan, historians, believe, subutai, was, born, in, the, year, 1175, probably, just, west, of, the, upper, onon, river, in, what, is, now, mongolia, some, historical, accounts, claim, that, he, belonged, to, the, uriankhai, clan, as, a, member, of, the, reindeer, people, according, to, these, accounts, subutai, lacked, the, natural, horsemanship, training, from, birth, that, all, mongols, possessed, making, him, an, outsider, among, them, however, recent, scholarship, has, discounted, this, earlier, narrative, stephen, pow, and, jingjing, liao, note, that, the, sense, of, irony, conjured, by, imagining, that, the, mongol, empire, s, greatest, general, was, a, reindeer, herding, outsider, to, steppe, nomadic, culture, has, a, strong, literary, appeal, to, modern, authors, in, fact, subutai, s, family, had, been, associated, with, the, family, of, temujin, future, genghis, khan, for, many, generations, subutai, s, great, great, grandfather, nerbi, was, supposedly, an, ally, of, the, mongol, khan, tumbina, sechen, subutai, s, father, jarchigudai, supposedly, supplied, food, to, temujin, and, his, followers, when, they, were, in, dire, straits, at, lake, baljuna, and, subutai, s, elder, brother, jelme, also, served, as, a, general, in, the, mongol, army, and, was, a, close, companion, of, temujin, jelme, rescued, a, severely, wounded, temujin, hit, by, an, arrow, from, jebe, then, an, enemy, in, the, process, of, unification, of, the, mongolian, plateau, another, brother, chaurkhan, also, romanized, as, ca, urqan, is, mentioned, in, the, secret, history, of, the, mongols, according, to, subutai, s, biography, in, the, history, of, yuan, subutai, s, father, was, once, driving, a, herd, of, sheep, in, order, to, present, them, to, his, overlord, taizu, genghis, khan, encountering, robbers, he, was, seized, huluhun, subutai, s, brother, and, subutai, arrived, in, good, time, and, with, their, lances, stabbed, some, of, the, robbers, horses, and, men, fell, together, and, the, remainder, of, the, band, withdrew, and, departed, consequently, they, relieved, their, father, s, difficulty, and, the, sheep, were, able, to, attain, the, emperor, s, station, despite, this, close, family, association, some, consider, subutai, s, career, proof, that, the, mongol, empire, was, a, meritocracy, he, was, a, commoner, by, birth, the, son, of, jarchigudai, who, was, supposedly, a, blacksmith, when, he, was, 14, years, old, subutai, left, his, clan, to, join, temujin, s, army, following, in, the, footsteps, of, his, older, brother, jelme, who, had, joined, when, he, was, 17, years, old, and, he, rose, to, the, very, highest, command, available, to, one, who, was, not, a, blood, relative, to, genghis, within, a, decade, he, rose, to, become, a, general, in, command, of, one, of, 4, tumens, operating, in, the, vanguard, during, the, invasion, of, northern, china, in, 1211, subutai, was, partnered, with, the, senior, mongol, general, jebe, an, apprentice, and, partnership, they, would, maintain, until, jebe, s, death, in, 1223, in, 1212, he, took, huan, by, storm, the, first, major, independent, exploit, mentioned, in, the, sources, genghis, khan, is, reported, to, have, called, him, one, of, his, dogs, of, war, who, were, 4, of, his, 8, top, lieutenants, in, the, secret, history, of, the, mongols, they, are, the, four, dogs, of, temujin, they, have, foreheads, of, brass, their, jaws, are, like, scissors, their, tongues, like, piercing, awls, their, heads, are, iron, their, whipping, tails, swords, in, the, day, of, battle, they, devour, enemy, flesh, behold, they, are, now, unleashed, and, they, slobber, at, the, mouth, with, glee, these, four, dogs, are, jebe, and, kublai, different, than, kublai, khan, jelme, and, subotai, appointed, to, the, prestigious, post, of, genghis, khan, s, ger, yurt, door, guard, during, his, teen, years, mongol, histories, say, that, subutai, said, to, genghis, khan, i, will, ward, off, your, enemies, as, felt, cloth, protects, one, from, the, wind, this, access, enabled, him, to, listen, on, and, later, join, the, mongol, strategy, meetings, somewhere, around, his, late, teens, and, early, twenties, throughout, most, of, genghis, khan, s, lifetime, subutai, would, have, the, opportunity, to, apprentice, on, detached, missions, under, the, elite, jebe, 1211, 12, 1213, 14, 1219, 23, and, muqali, 1213, 14, in, addition, to, genghis, khan, himself, 1219, subutai, s, first, chance, at, independent, command, came, in, 1197, during, action, against, the, merkit, when, he, was, 22, years, old, subutai, s, role, was, to, act, as, the, vanguard, and, defeat, one, of, the, merkit, camps, at, the, tchen, river, subutai, refused, genghis, khan, s, offer, for, extra, elite, troops, and, instead, traveled, to, the, merkit, camp, alone, posing, as, a, mongol, deserter, subutai, managed, to, convince, the, merkits, that, the, main, mongol, army, was, far, away, and, they, were, in, no, danger, as, a, result, the, merkit, lowered, their, guard, and, limited, their, patrols, allowing, the, mongols, to, easily, surprise, and, encircle, the, merkits, capturing, two, generals, he, also, served, as, a, commander, of, the, vanguard, with, distinction, in, the, 1204, battle, against, the, naiman, that, gave, the, mongols, total, control, over, mongolia, subutai, was, a, major, innovator, in, the, art, of, war, in, the, invasions, of, china, russia, and, europe, subutai, routinely, coordinated, large, forces, often, separated, by, large, distances, subutai, s, maneuvers, were, designed, to, mislead, his, foes, and, strike, them, from, unexpected, directions, the, mongol, invasion, of, the, jin, in, 1232, continually, pulled, the, hitherto, successful, jin, forces, apart, despite, their, highly, advantageous, terrain, as, they, could, not, determine, which, mongol, armies, were, the, feints, and, which, were, the, true, threats, until, their, main, army, became, isolated, and, starved, strongly, fortified, locations, would, be, bypassed, and, ignored, until, all, organized, resistance, had, been, destroyed, sieges, would, be, limited, to, critical, or, vulnerable, locations, in, other, situations, the, mongols, either, left, a, blockading, force, or, simply, ignored, fortified, citadels, and, devastated, the, surrounded, agriculture, so, that, the, remaining, people, would, starve, if, they, remained, within, fortified, walls, in, contrast, to, the, common, perception, of, steppe, horse, archer, armies, slowly, weakening, their, foes, with, arrows, for, many, hours, or, even, days, such, as, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, or, the, battle, of, manzikert, subutai, fought, in, a, much, more, decisive, and, fluid, manner, where, heavy, firepower, was, used, to, create, openings, for, rapid, cavalry, charges, with, deep, formations, at, the, battle, of, the, kalka, river, in, 1223, subutai, s, 20, 000, man, army, routed, the, 80, 000, man, russian, army, by, stringing, it, out, after, a, 9, day, retreat, and, then, immediately, turning, and, delivering, a, decisive, charge, without, a, prolonged, missile, bombardment, the, vanguard, of, the, russian, army, was, already, put, in, flight, before, the, second, wave, even, reached, the, battlefield, and, began, to, deploy, subutai, was, one, of, the, first, mongol, generals, alongside, genghis, khan, who, realized, the, value, of, engineers, in, siege, warfare, even, in, field, battles, he, made, use, of, siege, engines, in, the, battle, of, mohi, the, hungarian, crossbowmen, repelled, a, night, bridge, crossing, by, the, mongols, and, inflicted, considerable, casualties, on, the, mongols, fighting, to, cross, the, river, the, following, day, subutai, ordered, huge, stonethrowers, to, clear, the, bank, of, hungarian, crossbowmen, and, open, the, way, for, his, light, cavalry, to, cross, the, river, without, further, losses, this, use, of, siege, weapons, was, one, of, the, first, recorded, uses, of, artillery, bombardments, against, the, enemy, army, to, disrupt, their, resistance, while, simultaneously, attacking, them, in, execution, his, usage, functioned, more, akin, to, the, creeping, barrage, of, world, war, i, used, to, soften, and, disrupt, enemy, lines, right, before, an, attack, like, genghis, khan, subutai, was, a, master, at, creating, divisions, within, the, enemy, ranks, and, surprising, them, the, terrifying, mongol, reputation, combined, with, highly, effective, spy, networks, that, spread, discord, as, well, as, incentives, to, key, local, leaders, prevented, his, opponents, from, effectively, uniting, and, fighting, at, their, full, capacity, in, 1217, genghis, khan, sent, subutai, to, hunt, down, the, hated, merkits, and, their, allies, the, cuman, kipchak, confederation, in, modern, day, central, kazakhstan, subutai, defeated, them, on, the, chu, river, in, 1217, and, again, in, 1219, in, wild, kipchak, territory, before, the, battle, of, the, chem, river, in, 1219, subutai, had, his, vanguard, carry, children, s, toys, and, leave, them, behind, as, if, they, were, a, group, of, families, fleeing, from, the, merkit, as, a, result, of, this, deception, subutai, s, army, was, able, to, surprise, encircle, and, capture, of, all, the, merkit, kipchak, leadership, mohammed, ii, of, khwarizm, attacked, subutai, shortly, afterwards, along, the, irghiz, river, despite, being, outnumbered, three, to, one, against, the, sultan, s, elite, forces, which, had, conquered, much, of, central, asia, subutai, held, him, off, after, a, fierce, battle, and, retreated, during, the, night, according, to, persian, sources, this, battle, seems, to, have, eroded, mohammed, s, confidence, in, his, ability, to, defeat, the, mongols, in, pitched, battle, since, subutai, only, commanded, a, small, 20, 000, man, force, and, did, not, want, to, even, fight, him, supposedly, the, mongol, army, had, destroyed, his, left, wing, and, nearly, broken, his, center, and, captured, him, until, reinforcements, from, his, son, arrived, and, the, battlefield, turned, dark, because, of, this, battle, mohammed, was, unable, to, take, advantage, of, the, upheaval, in, the, kara, khitai, empire, simultaneously, being, conquered, by, the, mongolian, general, jebe, like, he, had, in, earlier, wars, genghis, khan, led, the, mongol, army, westwards, in, late, 1219, to, invade, khwarizm, as, retaliation, for, the, execution, of, mongol, ambassadors, with, roughly, 100, 000, armed, men, the, mongol, army, was, numerically, superior, to, the, forces, of, the, khwarizim, empire, and, through, deception, and, rapid, maneuver, the, mongols, defeated, the, isolated, khwarezm, armies, in, detail, before, they, could, react, serving, as, the, mongol, equivalent, of, genghis, khan, s, chief, of, staff, subutai, marched, with, the, khan, s, army, through, the, deadly, kyzylkum, desert, to, emerge, behind, the, khwarezm, defense, network, at, bukhara, after, the, rapid, capture, of, the, khwarezm, center, of, defense, samarkand, genghis, khan, dispatched, subutai, and, jebe, with, 30, 000, men, to, hunt, the, khwarezm, shah, and, prevent, him, from, rallying, the, other, khwarezm, armies, shah, mohammed, attempted, to, save, himself, by, fleeing, into, central, persia, but, while, he, eluded, capture, the, relentless, chase, meant, he, could, not, rally, his, forces, as, a, result, the, several, hundred, thousand, man, khwarezm, forces, in, reserve, remained, divided, and, were, easily, destroyed, piecemeal, by, genghis, khan, s, main, army, drained, by, the, fierce, pursuit, mohammed, fell, ill, and, died, at, a, fishing, village, on, an, island, in, the, caspian, sea, in, early, 1221, an, ignominious, end, for, the, man, who, styled, himself, the, second, alexander, subutai, and, jebe, spent, part, of, the, 1219, winter, in, azerbaijan, and, iran, raiding, and, looting, while, preventing, the, western, khwarezm, forces, from, assisting, the, rest, of, the, empire, to, the, east, here, he, conceived, the, idea, of, conducting, the, most, audacious, reconnaissance, in, force, in, history, which, was, described, by, edward, gibbon, as, which, has, never, been, attempted, and, has, never, been, repeated, 20, 000, mongol, forces, would, circle, the, caspian, sea, through, the, caucasus, mountains, to, fall, on, the, rear, of, the, wild, kipchaks, and, cumans, after, destroying, resistance, in, persia, and, submitting, azerbaijan, the, mongols, invaded, the, christian, kingdom, of, georgia, though, the, king, george, iv, of, georgia, was, reluctant, to, commit, to, battle, subutai, and, jebe, forced, his, hand, by, ravaging, the, countryside, and, killing, his, people, subutai, and, jebe, then, defeated, the, georgian, army, despite, the, presence, of, many, thousands, of, georgian, knights, by, luring, the, knights, away, from, their, infantry, with, a, feigned, retreat, then, enveloping, the, knights, after, destroying, them, the, mongols, encircled, and, crushed, the, georgian, army, subutai, who, was, identified, by, the, georgians, as, being, in, command, originally, lured, the, georgians, into, thinking, his, army, was, a, friendly, ally, by, having, his, men, parade, in, front, of, crosses, and, using, spies, to, start, false, rumors, that, the, mongols, were, actually, christian, wonder, workers, who, had, come, to, assist, the, georgians, this, mongol, reconnaissance, mission, may, have, inadvertently, altered, the, history, of, the, crusades, as, georgia, had, planned, on, sending, their, now, destroyed, army, to, join, the, fifth, crusade, instead, king, george, s, sister, rusudan, had, to, write, to, the, pope, honorius, iii, to, explain, that, they, could, not, assist, the, crusade, because, their, whole, army, had, been, disintegrated, though, georgia, lay, defenseless, after, these, catastrophic, defeats, the, mongol, mission, was, to, raid, and, scout, not, conquer, after, ravaging, georgia, the, mongols, cut, across, the, caucasus, mountains, during, the, winter, to, get, around, the, derbent, pass, the, mongols, were, tricked, by, their, guides, into, taking, a, perilous, route, and, emerged, from, the, mountains, exhausted, only, to, be, confronted, with, a, far, larger, steppe, coalition, army, using, clever, diplomacy, subutai, isolated, and, defeated, the, alans, circassians, and, don, kipchaks, cumans, in, detail, after, plundering, the, southern, russian, steppes, the, russian, princes, united, with, the, retreating, cuman, confederacy, to, defeat, the, mongols, with, an, 80, 000, man, host, despite, being, heavily, outnumbered, subutai, sacrificed, the, 1, 000, men, of, his, rear, guard, to, induce, the, coalition, army, to, recklessly, pursue, him, and, become, separated, the, plan, worked, but, strategic, advantage, came, at, a, high, price, in, all, likelihood, the, 1, 000, men, were, led, by, jebe, who, was, killed, by, some, kipchaks, as, expected, the, coalition, army, pursued, the, mongols, and, after, retreating, for, 9, days, subutai, suddenly, turned, and, crushed, the, combined, rus, and, cuman, army, at, the, kalka, 31, may, 1223, arab, historian, ibn, al, athir, mentions, a, campaign, against, volga, bulgaria, where, the, mongol, army, was, defeated, in, late, 1223, or, early, 1224, 620, according, to, ibn, al, athir, 4, 000, men, survived, from, the, mongol, side, in, this, battle, the, remaining, army, proceeded, to, desht, i, qipchaq, where, they, joined, the, army, of, jochi, but, historians, have, doubted, this, account, in, light, of, the, mongols, seeking, out, and, defeating, the, qangli, turks, in, southern, russia, shortly, afterward, in, the, initial, invasion, of, the, jin, in, 1211, subutai, served, with, jebe, s, army, that, attacked, the, chinese, forts, around, the, eastern, edge, of, the, great, wall, not, the, ming, great, wall, in, late, 1211, he, was, the, first, to, scale, the, walls, of, the, key, fortress, of, huan, chou, and, took, part, in, the, ambush, of, a, major, jin, army, at, wu, sha, pao, and, the, climactic, battle, of, yehuling, in, 1212, he, may, have, served, with, jebe, during, the, latter, s, daring, capture, of, liaoyang, and, in, 1213, he, served, with, muqali, and, jebe, in, a, great, raid, in, shandong, subutai, played, a, key, part, in, the, campaign, against, the, tanguts, of, xi, xia, in, 1226, serving, as, commander, of, the, flank, army, to, strike, the, tanguts, in, the, rear, while, genghis, invaded, the, xi, xia, by, a, more, traditional, northern, route, subutai, unexpectedly, attacked, from, the, west, over, the, mountains, and, inhospitable, deserts, in, modern, turkestan, causing, tangut, resistance, to, collapse, the, tangut, empire, was, cut, in, two, with, genghis, preventing, reinforcements, being, sent, west, subutai, subdued, resistance, in, the, west, and, joined, with, genghis, s, main, army, to, conquer, the, east, in, 1227, he, conquered, the, jin, districts, along, the, upper, wei, river, and, even, raided, the, kingdom, of, tibet, though, the, mongols, conquered, xi, xia, mongol, operations, against, jin, china, were, interrupted, by, the, death, of, genghis, khan, in, 1227, genghis, khan, was, succeeded, by, his, son, gedei, in, 1229, after, a, humiliating, defeat, by, the, resurgent, jin, in, 1230, 1231, gedei, personally, led, the, main, mongol, army, against, the, jin, in, central, china, and, appointed, subutai, to, salvage, the, situation, subutai, had, originally, been, assigned, to, conquer, the, kipchak, turks, in, central, russia, in, 1229, but, was, hurriedly, recalled, to, china, in, 1229, 1230, after, the, mongol, general, doqolqu, suffered, a, major, defeat, against, subutai, the, jin, generals, retreated, from, shaanxi, and, implemented, a, scorched, earth, policy, to, hold, the, fortified, tongguan, pass, and, block, any, access, to, the, jin, stronghold, of, henan, they, calculated, that, the, scorched, earth, policies, would, deny, the, mongols, the, ability, to, sustain, a, lengthy, siege, and, their, lines, of, fortifications, and, difficult, terrain, would, prevent, the, mongols, from, outmaneuvering, them, at, the, battle, of, daohuigu, subutai, initially, attempted, to, outflank, the, jin, by, feinting, an, attack, at, the, fortified, location, of, weizhou, and, maneuvering, through, an, unguarded, side, corridor, though, the, jin, were, fooled, by, the, feint, they, moved, with, great, alacrity, once, subutai, s, main, advance, was, discovered, and, the, attempt, to, break, into, the, plains, of, henan, ended, in, failure, after, subutai, s, advanced, raiding, parties, were, checked, at, shan, ch, e, hui, the, mongols, defeated, a, relieving, force, and, captured, fengxiang, a, secondary, target, by, concentrating, 400, trebuchets, at, a, corner, of, the, wall, however, the, overall, campaign, seemed, to, have, reached, a, stalemate, in, 1231, 1232, subutai, made, another, attempt, to, outmaneuver, the, jin, fortified, lines, by, using, a, similar, highly, audacious, approach, that, they, had, employed, in, khwarezm, 1219, and, xi, xia, 1226, the, mongols, divided, into, three, armies, one, to, attack, henan, from, the, north, in, the, center, of, the, yellow, river, another, to, attempt, to, cross, the, yellow, river, in, shandong, in, the, east, and, the, last, under, subutai, and, tolui, invading, the, song, empire, and, attacking, henan, from, the, more, exposed, south, the, song, initially, refused, to, allow, the, mongols, passage, through, the, rugged, qinling, mountains, so, subutai, dodged, their, forces, and, isolated, the, mountain, citadels, one, by, one, disheartened, by, the, ease, of, the, mongol, advance, against, their, strong, fortifications, the, song, agreed, to, supply, guides, this, time, subutai, was, able, to, outmaneuver, the, jin, armies, and, cross, the, han, river, to, invade, henan, from, the, south, the, main, jin, army, promptly, marched, to, intercept, subutai, s, army, at, mount, yu, its, commander, wan, yen, heda, attempted, to, ambush, the, mongols, but, the, ambush, was, detected, in, turn, the, mongols, attempted, to, draw, him, into, their, own, ambush, with, a, feigned, retreat, but, he, held, his, strong, position, after, a, full, day, of, fierce, fighting, that, resulted, in, a, stalemate, the, mongols, retreated, under, darkness, and, attempted, to, hide, their, trail, and, outflank, the, jin, wan, yen, heda, had, retreated, towards, the, city, of, tengzhou, in, order, to, obtain, supplies, changing, tracks, subutai, identifying, that, the, jin, were, vulnerable, to, attrition, used, a, feint, attack, to, temporarily, divert, the, jin, forces, away, from, their, supply, train, which, he, promptly, seized, with, a, hidden, force, rather, than, continually, attempting, to, attack, the, vigilant, jin, during, their, retreat, subutai, instead, dispersed, his, army, into, several, detachments, to, target, supplies, in, the, area, 3, 000, men, masked, the, mongol, dispersion, and, occupied, the, jin, s, attention, while, other, mongol, forces, slowly, slipped, away, from, the, field, in, small, numbers, to, hide, their, movements, towards, the, jin, capital, of, kaifeng, the, route, that, wan, yen, heda, was, retreating, along, with, part, of, his, force, harassing, the, jin, army, s, foragers, the, other, units, marched, around, the, flanks, in, a, wide, arc, and, emerged, ahead, of, the, jin, army, aiming, to, destroy, or, steal, the, supplies, of, nearby, villages, along, the, jin, s, line, of, retreat, ogedei, khan, had, been, able, to, cross, the, yellow, river, after, the, jin, army, blocking, him, had, to, march, south, to, help, wan, yan, heda, with, subutai, s, army, having, maneuvered, along, the, jin, rear, ogedei, was, able, to, send, reinforcements, to, subutai, bringing, the, total, mongol, strength, to, 50, 000, men, after, these, reinforcements, arrived, and, with, the, jin, army, s, food, supplies, severely, depleted, over, the, past, three, weeks, subutai, forced, a, battle, on, his, terms, and, won, a, decisive, victory, at, the, battle, of, sanfengshan, capturing, wan, yen, heda, and, annihilating, the, main, jin, army, which, had, nowhere, safe, to, retreat, to, he, then, made, forced, marches, and, eliminated, the, other, jin, armies, holding, the, other, fronts, at, the, battles, of, yangyi, 24, february, 1232, and, t, iehling, 1, march, 1232, the, heavily, fortified, city, of, kaifeng, required, an, eight, month, long, siege, subutai, was, forced, to, construct, lines, of, circumvallation, that, had, a, perimeter, stretching, 87, km, 54, mi, additionally, the, jin, began, to, employ, a, cutting, edge, gunpowder, weapon, called, thunder, crash, bombs, which, made, it, very, difficult, for, the, mongols, to, get, close, enough, for, more, concentrated, fire, after, cutting, off, kaifeng, from, any, outside, help, subutai, alternated, intense, bombardments, using, a, mixture, of, muslim, trebuchets, mangonels, and, captured, gunpowder, with, periods, of, rest, and, plundering, the, countryside, the, mongol, dispersion, helped, them, avoid, contagion, by, the, plague, that, devastated, kaifeng, and, after, being, stretched, to, the, limit, the, emperor, fled, and, the, city, surrendered, subutai, originally, wanted, to, execute, everyone, in, kaifeng, to, punish, them, for, their, intransigence, and, extremely, long, resistance, however, gedei, intervened, and, ordered, subutai, to, treat, them, fairly, with, assistance, from, the, song, dynasty, the, last, jin, stronghold, of, caizhou, fell, in, 1234, however, it, did, not, take, the, song, long, to, fall, out, with, the, mongols, two, song, armies, seized, kaifeng, and, luoyang, during, the, summer, of, 1234, during, subutai, s, absence, subutai, returned, destroyed, the, three, song, armies, by, isolating, and, defeating, them, and, retook, the, cities, he, then, made, a, preemptive, raid, into, song, territory, to, force, them, to, adopt, a, defensive, position, though, war, had, begun, between, the, mongols, and, song, subutai, was, recalled, to, the, west, still, subutai, s, victories, had, taught, the, song, a, lesson, they, would, heed, no, song, army, would, dare, venture, north, to, attack, mongol, territory, afterward, gedei, decided, to, send, a, major, part, of, the, army, into, the, western, regions, to, finally, crush, the, wild, kipchaks, and, bulgars, subutai, was, tasked, to, direct, the, operations, under, the, overall, command, of, prince, batu, this, mission, was, more, than, just, a, typical, invasion, gedei, sent, many, of, the, next, generation, of, mongol, princes, including, the, heirs, of, each, of, the, four, families, most, likely, to, be, trained, by, subutai, before, he, died, in, order, to, crush, the, volga, bulgars, who, had, previously, defeated, batu, in, 1232, subutai, launched, another, giant, encirclement, campaign, the, mongols, marched, up, the, volga, river, in, a, wide, arc, on, the, west, side, however, this, force, was, just, to, occupy, their, attention, for, he, sent, a, secondary, army, to, surprise, the, bulgars, from, the, east, by, crossing, the, ural, mountains, after, squashing, the, bulgar, armies, he, defeated, the, guerrilla, leader, bachman, on, the, north, side, of, the, caspian, sea, bachman, had, ensconced, himself, on, an, island, and, taunted, the, mongols, however, they, constructed, a, mini, navy, of, 200, boats, trapped, bachman, within, a, limited, area, and, gradually, closed, the, net, unlike, in, 1222, 23, when, the, majority, of, the, rus, states, allied, against, subutai, and, jebe, this, time, the, mongols, apparently, struck, with, such, speed, that, the, rus, were, either, too, paralyzed, or, possibly, too, bitter, or, distracted, to, ally, in, late, 1237, subutai, attacked, ryazan, and, vladimir, suzdal, operating, with, three, columns, attacking, as, the, mongols, usually, did, during, the, winter, when, the, rivers, froze, over, the, rus, forces, were, defeated, in, 3, separate, engagements, and, their, cities, were, taken, in, quick, succession, the, mongols, spent, the, summer, of, 1238, resting, along, the, don, river, columns, were, sent, out, to, subjugate, the, various, tribes, living, in, the, plains, around, the, black, sea, in, 1239, the, rus, state, of, chernigov, was, defeated, and, their, cities, were, taken, the, mongols, were, spared, the, need, to, conquer, novgorod, when, the, principality, surrendered, agreed, to, pay, tribute, in, the, future, and, gave, the, mongols, a, large, bribe, the, most, notable, encounter, of, the, campaign, was, the, battle, of, the, sit, river, in, 1238, the, grand, duke, yuri, of, vladimir, the, most, prominent, of, the, rus, leaders, had, left, vladimir, to, raise, an, army, and, defeat, the, mongols, before, they, reached, his, city, however, the, mongols, evaded, his, army, and, captured, vladimir, before, he, even, knew, what, had, happened, when, yuri, sent, out, a, strong, reconnaissance, force, to, penetrate, the, mongol, scouting, screen, his, lieutenant, told, him, in, horror, that, his, army, was, already, entirely, surrounded, not, surprisingly, yuri, and, his, army, were, easily, defeated, the, mongols, had, made, a, treaty, with, galicia, volhynia, whose, prince, was, therefore, taken, by, surprise, when, the, mongols, suddenly, attacked, in, december, 1240, kiev, vladimir, and, other, cities, were, quickly, taken, the, attack, on, europe, was, planned, and, carried, out, by, subutai, who, achieved, his, lasting, fame, with, his, victories, there, having, devastated, the, various, russian, principalities, he, sent, spies, as, far, as, poland, hungary, and, austria, in, preparation, for, an, attack, into, the, heartland, of, europe, having, a, clear, picture, of, the, european, kingdoms, he, brilliantly, prepared, an, attack, nominally, commanded, by, batu, khan, and, two, other, princes, of, the, blood, while, batu, khan, son, of, jochi, was, the, overall, leader, subutai, was, the, actual, commander, in, the, field, and, as, such, was, present, in, both, the, northern, and, southern, campaigns, against, kievan, rus, he, personally, commanded, the, central, column, that, moved, against, the, kingdom, of, hungary, and, likely, gave, detailed, instructions, to, his, subordinates, though, the, mongol, methods, of, warfare, were, mostly, a, mystery, in, the, west, the, king, of, hungary, bela, iv, was, well, informed, of, the, mongol, invasion, of, russia, and, prepared, as, well, as, the, fractured, relations, of, europe, would, allow, him, to, though, bela, was, unable, to, obtain, help, from, the, holy, roman, empire, or, the, pope, he, did, at, least, have, the, support, of, his, cousins, in, poland, once, again, subutai, invaded, during, winter, when, they, would, be, least, expected, the, mongol, invasion, of, europe, was, a, five, pronged, attack, kaidu, and, orda, khan, ravaged, northern, poland, baidar, southern, poland, while, shiban, attacked, through, the, rugged, terrain, in, northeastern, hungary, subutai, and, batu, invaded, central, hungary, and, guyuk, marched, south, through, transylvania, the, mongols, dispersed, their, forces, in, order, to, confuse, the, europeans, as, to, their, ultimate, objectives, and, defeat, the, european, armies, piecemeal, before, they, could, mass, into, a, central, force, after, a, series, of, sweeping, victories, baidar, and, kadan, regrouped, their, northern, force, and, defeated, the, main, polish, army, at, the, battle, of, legnica, right, before, it, could, merge, with, the, bohemian, army, a, days, march, away, while, g, y, k, s, army, triumphed, in, transylvania, a, day, after, legnica, subutai, was, waiting, for, the, hungarian, army, on, the, hungarian, plain, though, the, hungarian, king, bela, iv, had, effectively, blocked, the, carpathian, passes, using, felled, trees, ditches, traps, and, other, natural, obstacles, in, addition, to, the, general, disrepair, or, simple, nonexistence, of, roads, in, eastern, hungary, subutai, s, force, still, managed, an, astonishing, pace, of, 100, km, 60, mi, a, day, despite, several, feet, of, snow, the, mongols, retained, a, pioneer, corps, capable, of, efficiently, clearing, pathways, through, the, forest, and, were, unfazed, by, bela, s, obstacles, only, one, day, after, the, smaller, mongol, army, in, poland, had, won, the, battle, of, legnica, subutai, launched, his, attack, thus, beginning, the, battle, of, mohi, during, the, night, of, 10, april, 1241, at, mohi, the, mongols, fixated, the, hungarian, attention, in, the, center, by, assaulting, the, lone, bridge, and, attempting, to, ford, to, the, north, and, around, the, bridge, the, main, body, began, to, cross, the, sajo, by, the, bridge, at, mohi, and, continued, to, attack, the, following, day, this, was, met, with, fierce, resistance, so, catapults, were, used, to, clear, the, opposite, bank, of, crossbowmen, as, was, noted, earlier, meanwhile, subutai, in, secret, created, a, pontoon, bridge, to, the, south, where, the, river, was, too, deep, to, be, forded, and, crossed, the, river, in, secret, with, a, large, force, when, the, crossing, was, completed, the, second, contingent, attacked, from, the, south, and, a, third, from, the, north, the, threat, of, now, reassembled, mongol, force, enveloping, the, hungarian, army, on, the, far, side, of, the, sajo, river, forced, the, hungarians, to, retreat, into, their, wagon, laager, camp, a, traditional, tool, of, fighting, against, nomadic, armies, however, the, mongols, surrounded, the, fortified, hungarian, camp, and, bombarded, it, with, trebuchets, gunpowder, weapons, and, flaming, arrows, hungarian, cavalry, charges, were, lured, further, away, from, their, camp, and, encircled, the, result, was, complete, panic, and, to, ensure, that, the, hungarians, did, not, fight, to, the, last, man, the, mongols, left, an, obvious, gap, in, their, encirclement, this, was, one, of, subutai, s, classic, tricks, to, create, a, tactical, situation, which, appeared, to, be, favourable, to, the, enemy, subutai, did, not, want, a, battle, where, the, massed, crossbowmen, supported, by, mounted, knights, stood, firm, and, fought, to, the, death, against, his, army, he, far, preferred, to, let, them, flee, and, be, slaughtered, individually, the, apparent, gap, in, the, mongol, lines, was, an, invitation, to, retreat, which, would, leave, the, knights, and, crossbowmen, spread, out, all, over, the, countryside, easy, pickings, for, the, disciplined, mongols, as, subutai, had, planned, the, hungarians, poured, through, this, hole, in, the, mongol, lines, which, led, to, a, swampy, area, poor, footing, for, horses, and, hard, going, for, infantry, when, the, hungarian, knights, split, up, the, mongol, archers, picked, them, off, at, will, it, was, later, noted, that, corpses, littered, the, countryside, over, the, space, of, a, two, day, journey, two, archbishops, and, three, bishops, were, killed, at, the, sajo, plus, more, than, 10, 000, fighting, men, in, one, stroke, the, bulk, of, hungarian, fighting, men, were, totally, destroyed, but, mongol, casualties, in, the, center, had, been, higher, than, normal, in, addition, to, anywhere, from, many, hundreds, to, many, thousands, of, regular, soldiers, batu, lost, 30, of, his, 4, 000, strong, ba, aaturs, heavily, armored, bodyguards, and, one, of, his, lieutenants, bagatu, bakatu, which, caused, tension, later, in, the, camp, in, addition, to, defeating, the, enemy, subutai, also, had, to, spend, substantial, energy, keeping, the, egos, of, the, mongol, princes, in, check, during, the, hungarian, campaign, during, the, battle, subutai, had, to, shame, batu, into, continuing, the, fight, after, the, first, failed, attack, on, the, bridge, batu, first, blamed, subutai, for, taking, too, long, to, ford, the, river, but, subutai, rebuffed, him, by, saying, that, they, knew, fording, the, river, would, take, time, and, batu, had, launched, his, attack, preemptively, in, the, end, batu, apologized, to, subutai, this, was, not, the, first, time, that, subutai, had, to, bail, batu, out, of, a, mistake, during, the, invasion, of, russia, batu, had, struggled, for, weeks, to, conquer, the, fortress, of, torzhok, launching, several, failed, assaults, subutai, had, to, divert, his, movements, take, command, and, conquered, the, fortress, in, three, days, with, ease, either, at, this, feast, or, another, one, shortly, after, batu, got, into, a, heated, argument, with, the, mongol, princes, guyuk, and, buri, guyuk, and, buri, jealous, of, batu, accused, batu, of, incompetence, and, riding, subutai, s, coattails, this, resulted, in, guyuk, and, batu, and, possibly, some, of, their, men, being, sent, home, to, gedei, khan, for, judgment, causing, further, rifts, in, the, mongol, army, despite, these, obstacles, the, mongols, still, attempted, to, solidify, their, control, over, hungary, from, rogerius, writings, it, would, seem, that, scattered, resistance, by, the, peasantry, was, attempted, but, it, never, really, got, off, the, ground, perhaps, in, part, due, to, the, flat, open, plains, of, central, hungary, allowing, scant, opportunity, for, ambush, or, withdrawal, after, the, defeat, of, the, hungarians, at, mohi, subutai, used, a, stolen, royal, seal, to, issue, bogus, decrees, across, the, country, leaving, many, unassuming, inhabitants, at, his, mercy, in, order, to, keep, the, pressure, on, bela, subutai, split, his, forces, into, several, detachments, a, light, cavalry, force, under, kadan, was, sent, to, chase, king, bela, along, the, adriatic, coast, while, the, main, army, with, its, siege, engines, under, subutai, and, batu, attempted, to, pacify, hungary, proper, other, mongol, forces, raided, outside, the, borders, of, hungary, even, reaching, austria, before, being, repulsed, in, a, skirmish, near, wiener, neustadt, the, mongols, successfully, besieged, several, cities, including, the, fortified, city, at, oradea, the, castle, of, st, martin, of, pannonia, and, the, capital, esztergom, though, the, latter, s, stone, citadel, held, out, and, not, all, sieges, proved, successful, by, early, 1242, subutai, was, discussing, plans, to, invade, the, holy, roman, empire, when, news, came, of, the, death, of, gedei, khan, and, a, revolt, by, the, cumans, in, russia, carpini, alleges, that, over, the, objections, of, subutai, the, mongol, princes, withdrew, the, army, to, mongolia, for, the, election, of, a, new, great, khan, this, account, of, events, is, disputed, with, rashid, al, din, specifically, noting, that, batu, and, subutai, only, heard, of, the, khan, s, death, after, they, had, already, begun, the, withdrawal, however, the, death, of, ogedei, and, the, turmoil, immediately, after, it, prevented, the, mongols, from, returning, to, europe, for, decades, still, the, devastation, had, been, immense, subutai, had, devastated, the, agriculture, of, any, area, that, was, resisting, though, some, of, the, civilians, had, escaped, capture, or, death, by, hiding, in, castles, forests, or, marshes, they, returned, to, their, ruined, fields, only, to, starve, some, historians, have, claimed, that, a, quarter, to, a, half, of, hungary, s, population, may, have, died, from, the, invasion, even, in, 1250, eight, years, after, the, mongols, had, left, hungarian, king, bela, wrote, to, pope, innocent, iv, that, hungary, could, not, withstand, another, invasion, and, would, have, to, surrender, to, the, mongols, if, they, returned, after, subduing, a, cuman, revolt, in, what, is, now, russia, subutai, turned, towards, mongolia, subutai, insisted, that, batu, attend, the, kurultai, to, elect, the, successor, of, ogedei, in, the, mongolian, heartland, batu, declined, to, come, and, g, y, k, was, elected, after, three, years, with, subutai, s, support, g, y, k, had, no, love, for, batu, and, wanted, the, best, of, the, mongol, generals, to, be, made, unavailable, to, batu, if, the, feud, between, them, came, to, open, war, the, new, khagan, placed, subutai, in, charge, at, the, age, of, 71, of, the, campaign, against, the, song, dynasty, for, 1246, 1247, the, papal, envoy, plano, carpini, saw, him, when, he, was, in, karakorum, mongolia, he, said, subutai, was, well, respected, among, the, mongols, and, called, him, a, knight, valiant, hero, translation, of, baghatur, subutai, returned, to, mongolia, from, the, song, campaign, in, 1248, and, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, at, his, home, in, the, vicinity, of, the, tuul, river, near, modern, ulaanbaatar, dying, there, at, the, age, of, 72, a, folk, legend, claimed, that, subutai, wished, to, die, by, his, son, uriyangkhadai, by, the, banks, of, the, danube, river, subutai, s, descendants, such, as, uriyangkhadai, and, aju, would, serve, the, great, khans, for, the, next, three, decades, as, commanders, uriyangkhadai, would, successfully, conquer, the, kingdom, of, dali, but, not, dai, viet, however, he, later, achieved, great, success, invading, song, china, from, the, southwest, in, the, 1258, invasion, of, m, ngke, khan, aju, fought, with, his, father, and, then, later, led, the, successful, five, year, mongol, siege, of, the, pivotal, dual, fortress, of, xiangyang, fancheng, in, the, battle, of, xiangyang, which, opened, up, a, gateway, into, the, heart, of, the, song, and, enabled, their, total, conquest, six, years, later, in, 1279, no, mongol, general, played, a, greater, role, than, subotei, ba, atur, in, establishing, and, maintaining, the, early, mongol, empire, trusted, commander, and, retainer, of, chinggis, later, highly, respected, servant, of, ogodei, and, guyuk, subotei, served, with, great, distinction, in, every, phase, of, mongolian, national, development, during, the, first, four, decades, of, empire, when, he, first, entered, the, service, of, temujin, the, later, cinggis, qan, the, realm, of, that, minor, mongol, chieftain, comprised, only, a, few, families, in, his, old, age, subotei, saw, a, mighty, dominion, stretching, from, the, borders, of, hungary, to, the, sea, of, japan, from, the, outskirts, of, novgorod, to, the, persian, gulf, and, the, yangtze, river, he, had, no, small, part, in, creating, it, in, a, unique, historical, anomaly, the, strategic, and, operational, innovations, of, genghis, khan, and, subutai, became, lost, in, history, and, others, were, forced, to, rediscover, them, 600, and, 700, years, later, even, though, subutai, had, devastated, the, armies, of, russia, georgia, hungary, poland, bulgaria, and, latin, constantinople, in, a, series, of, one, sided, campaigns, western, military, leaders, historians, and, theorists, completely, ignored, him, until, the, 20th, century, the, mongols, did, not, operate, as, one, distinct, mass, but, instead, moved, along, 3, 5, axes, of, approach, often, 500, 1000, km, apart, and, threatened, numerous, objectives, simultaneously, like, napoleon, subutai, and, genghis, khan, would, disperse, their, forces, along, a, wide, frontage, and, rapidly, coalesce, at, decisive, points, to, defeat, the, enemy, in, detail, their, methods, were, aligned, to, completely, crush, the, enemy, state, s, will, to, fight, subutai, has, been, credited, as, the, first, general, to, operate, campaigns, using, the, modern, organizational, methods, of, command, and, control, though, unknown, to, the, west, for, many, centuries, subutai, s, exploits, were, featured, by, the, british, military, theorist, b, h, liddell, hart, in, his, book, great, captains, unveiled, after, world, war, i, liddell, hart, used, the, example, of, the, mongols, under, genghis, and, subutai, to, demonstrate, how, a, mechanized, army, could, fight, using, the, principles, of, mobility, dispersion, and, surprise, due, to, his, innovative, battle, tactics, and, novelty, in, strategy, he, is, a, source, of, inspiration, for, later, generals, in, particular, erwin, rommel, and, george, patton, were, avid, students, of, mongol, campaigns, russia, derived, the, most, use, out, of, a, careful, study, of, the, mongol, campaigns, their, closer, proximity, to, the, steppe, gave, them, greater, interest, and, access, to, the, mongolian, campaigns, first, analyzed, by, the, russian, general, mikhail, ivanin, in, the, 19th, century, which, became, a, recommended, text, in, the, russian, military, academies, up, until, the, mid, 20th, century, ivanin, s, work, became, used, in, the, deep, battle, doctrine, developed, by, soviet, marshal, mikhail, tukhachevsky, mikhail, frunze, and, g, s, isserson, deep, battle, doctrine, bore, a, heavy, resemblance, to, mongol, strategic, methods, substituting, tanks, motorized, troop, carriers, artillery, and, airplanes, for, mongol, horse, archers, lancers, and, field, artillery, the, red, army, even, went, so, far, as, to, copy, subutai, s, use, of, smokescreens, on, the, battlefield, to, cover, troop, movements, later, in, the, 20th, century, american, military, theorist, john, boyd, and, some, of, his, followers, used, genghis, khan, and, subutai, s, campaigns, as, examples, of, maneuver, warfare
