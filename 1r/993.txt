leadership, of, the, b, b, religion, attempting, to, elevate, himself, among, b, b, s, yahya, and, a, few, supporters, referenced, a, letter, the, b, b, had, written, a, few, years, earlier, when,

appointed, the, successor, or, vicegerent, of, the, b, b, knowledgeable, b, b, s, promptly, rejected, yahya, s, bold, claim, because, the, referenced, letter, indicated, no, such, status, and, due, to, the, fact, that, other, writings, of, the, b, b, specifically, eliminated, the, institution, of, successorship, or, vicegerency, from, his, religion, the, b, b, also, decreed, no, one, s, words, would, be, binding, upon, believers, until, the, advent, of, the, promised, one, others, questioned, yahya, s, motives, considering, he, had, never, done, anything, to, protect, the, b, b, faith, or, the, lives, of, b, b, s, over, which, he, was, now, claiming, a, high, position, to, bolster, his, effort, yahya, simultaneously, sought, to, discredit, bah, u, ll, h, by, spreading, false, rumors, and, accusations, about, him, which, stirred, up, feelings, among, b, b, s, in, the, baghdad, community, declining, to, dispute, with, yahya, or, do, anything, to, endanger, the, unity, and, survival, of, the, already, demoralized, b, b, community, bah, u, ll, h, entrusted, his, family, to, the, care, of, his, brother, mirza, musa, and, without, notice, left, baghdad, on, 10, april, 1854, for, mountains, in, the, north, near, sulaymaniyyih, in, kurdistan, he, later, wrote, that, he, withdrew, to, avoid, becoming, a, source, of, disagreement, within, the, b, b, community, initially, living, as, a, hermit, in, those, mountains, bah, u, ll, h, dressed, as, a, dervish, and, used, the, name, darvish, muhammad, i, irani, in, sulaymaniyyih, the, head, of, a, noted, theological, seminary, happened, to, meet, bah, u, ll, h, and, invited, him, to, visit, there, a, student, noticed, bah, u, ll, h, s, exquisite, penmanship, which, raised, the, curiosity, of, leading, instructors, as, he, responded, to, their, queries, on, complex, religious, themes, bah, u, ll, h, quickly, gained, admiration, for, his, learning, and, wisdom, shaykh, uthm, n, shaykh, abdu, r, rahm, n, and, shaykh, ism, l, leaders, of, the, naqshband, yyih, q, dir, yyih, and, kh, lid, yyih, orders, respectively, began, to, seek, his, advice, it, was, to, the, second, of, these, that, bah, u, ll, h, s, book, the, four, valleys, was, written, during, bah, u, ll, h, s, absence, from, the, baghdad, b, b, community, mirza, yahya, s, true, nature, became, increasingly, clear, the, public, respect, and, morale, of, b, b, s, soon, disintegrated, as, yahya, failed, to, give, spiritual, guidance, or, to, demonstrate, in, daily, living, the, lofty, standards, taught, by, the, b, b, his, actions, to, discredit, bah, u, ll, h, and, any, who, admired, him, grew, at, the, same, time, yahya, used, the, b, b, faith, to, benefit, himself, materially, and, to, try, to, augment, his, delusory, standing, employing, means, towards, those, ends, which, shamefully, contradicted, statements, by, the, b, b, he, also, engaged, in, criminal, activities, including, persuading, several, followers, to, murder, other, b, b, s, whom, yahya, viewed, as, potential, adversaries, or, as, supporters, of, such, imagined, rivals, yahya, even, took, steps, to, initiate, another, attempt, to, assassinate, the, shah, of, persia, yahya, s, utter, failings, as, a, religious, leader, led, most, b, b, s, to, reject, his, claims, when, rumors, of, a, saint, living, in, sulaymaniyyih, reached, b, b, friends, in, baghdad, they, suspected, it, was, bah, u, ll, h, and, asked, one, of, his, relatives, to, locate, and, beg, him, to, return, to, help, the, community, acceding, to, their, urgent, requests, to, which, yahya, even, added, an, appeal, bah, u, ll, h, returned, to, baghdad, on, 19, march, 1856, over, the, next, 7, years, bah, u, ll, h, undertook, to, transform, the, b, b, community, through, personal, example, as, well, as, encouragement, and, constant, interaction, with, b, b, s, bah, u, ll, h, restored, the, community, to, the, moral, and, spiritual, level, it, had, attained, during, the, b, b, s, lifetime, growing, numbers, were, drawn, to, join, the, reinvigorated, b, b, movement, as, bah, u, ll, h, s, renown, as, a, spiritual, guide, and, b, b, leader, grew, mirza, yahya, remained, withdrawn, the, spread, of, bah, u, ll, h, s, reputation, in, baghdad, and, surrounding, areas, along, with, increased, dissemination, of, his, writings, attracted, rinces, scholars, mystics, and, government, officials, to, meet, him, many, prominent, in, persian, public, life, this, development, unnerved, antithetical, elements, among, iran, s, islamic, clergy, and, again, raised, the, intense, fear, and, suspicion, of, the, iranian, monarch, and, his, advisors, the, persian, government, asked, the, ottoman, government, to, extradite, bah, u, ll, h, back, to, persia, but, the, latter, refused, the, persians, then, pressed, the, ottomans, to, remove, bah, u, ll, h, from, baghdad, which, was, near, iran, s, border, the, result, was, an, invitation, in, april, 1863, from, sultan, abdu, l, az, z, himself, inviting, bah, u, ll, h, to, reside, in, the, ottoman, capital, constantinople, now, istanbul, on, 22, april, 1863, bah, u, ll, h, left, his, house, in, baghdad, for, the, banks, of, the,

twelve, days, with, family, members, and, a, few, close, followers, chosen, to, accompany, him, upon, arrival, in, the, garden, bah, u, ll, h, declared, to, his, companions, that, he, was, him, whom, god, shall, make, manifest, the, one, promised, by, the, b, b, and, announced, that, his, mission, as, god, s, latest, manifestation, in, this, world, had, commenced, bah, u, ll, h, left, the, ri, v,

not, included, in, the, sultan, s, invitation, mirza, yahya, joined, the, group, en, route, after, fifteen, weeks, bah, u, ll, h, arrived, in, the, ottoman, capital, on, 16, august, 1863, he, was, welcomed, by, various, government, ministers, of, the, sultan, and, by, prominent, personalities, who, paid, their, respects, the, persian, ambassador, also, sent, emissaries, to, greet, him, the, day, after, his, arrival, at, the, time, it, was, customary, for, prominent, government, guests, such, as, bah, u, ll, h, to, call, on, the, prime, minister, and, other, high, ranking, officials, during, which, the, guests, would, seek, favors, broker, deals, and, secure, various, forms, of, official, support, for, themselves, when, bah, u, ll, h, did, not, return, any, visits, kamal, pasha, a, former, ottoman, prime, minister, even, reminded, him, of, the, custom, bah, u, ll, h, s, response, was, that, he, knew, of, the, practice, but, had, no, demands, to, make, of, anyone, nor, did, he, require, favors, from, them, therefore, there, was, no, reason, for, him, to, call, upon, anyone, bah, u, ll, h, s, independence, and, detachment, from, the, situation, was, used, by, the, persian, ambassador, to, maliciously, misrepresent, bah, u, ll, h, before, the, ottoman, court, and, to, press, for, his, banishment, from, the, capital, as, a, consequence, less, than, four, months, after, arriving, in, constantinople, the, prime, minister, suggested, the, sultan, banish, bah, u, ll, h, and, his, companions, to, adrianople, now, edirne, which, the, ruler, promptly, approved, on, 12, december, 1863, bah, u, ll, h, arrived, in, adrianople, with, his, family, and, other, companions, his, presence, there, which, lasted, four, and, a, half, years, became, a, significant, period, for, the, further, unfoldment, of, his, mission, among, b, b, s, and, for, the, general, proclamation, of, his, cause, over, the, next, two, years, writings, which, flowed, from, bah, u, ll, h, were,

ll, h, had, kept, burning, convinced, that, bah, u, ll, h, s, death, was, necessary, for, his, own, advancement, yahya, s, first, effort, towards, that, end, involved, personally, poisoning, bah, u, ll, h, when, he, invited, him, for, tea, his, doing, so, caused, a, severe, month, long, illness, that, left, bah, u, ll, h, with, a, tremor, in, his, hand, for, the, rest, of, his, life, though, bah, u, ll, h, advised, those, who, knew, not, to, speak, of, what, had, happened, awareness, of, the, incident, grew, giving, rise, to, strong, agitation, among, b, b, s, however, it, was, yahya, s, subsequent, attempt, on, bah, u, ll, h, s, life, that, brought, about, an, unprecedented, commotion, in, the, community, it, involved, ustad, muhammad, aliy, i, salmani, a, traditional, barber, who, served, as, bah, u, ll, h, s, bath, attendant, salmani, reported, that, yahya, suddenly, began, to, show, kindness, to, him, then, one, day, insinuated, it, would, be, a, great, service, to, their, religion, if, he, assassinated, bah, u, ll, h, while, attending, to, him, in, the, bath, salmani, was, so, outraged, he, said, his, immediate, thought, was, to, kill, yahya, he, hesitated, only, because, he, knew, doing, that, would, displease, bah, u, ll, h, agitated, he, informed, bah, u, ll, h, s, faithful, brother, mirza, musa, of, the, incident, who, advised, him, to, ignore, it, saying, yahya, had, thought, of, this, for, years, still, upset, salmani, told, abdu, l, bah, bah, u, ll, h, s, eldest, son, about, the, matter, who, told, him, not, to, speak, of, it, to, others, salmani, finally, informed, bah, u, ll, h, who, likewise, said, he, should, not, mention, it, to, anyone, until, this, incident, because, yahya, was, a, half, brother, whom, bah, u, ll, h, always, treated, with, kindness, and, care, most, in, the, b, b, community, also, showed, yahya, respect, even, if, they, did, not, accept, his, claims, to, a, special, religious, status, however, when, salmani, was, unable, to, keep, silent, and, openly, related, to, others, what, yahya, had, asked, of, him, yahya, s, actions, and, intentions, so, contrary, to, the, b, b, s, teachings, incited, great, turmoil, amidst, the, b, b, s, having, given, his, younger, sibling, ample, guidance, and, opportunities, to, live, as, a, b, b, should, and, having, repeatedly, forgiven, him, for, things, he, had, done, in, the, past, bah, u, ll, h, decided, the, time, had, come, to, formally, declare, to, mirza, yahya, that, he, was, god, s, latest, manifestation, the, promised, one, of, the, b, b, him, whom, god, shall, make, manifest, because, doing, so, would, require, him, to, obey, bah, u, ll, h, if, yahya, were, to, remain, faithful, to, the, b, b, bah, u, ll, h, made, that, declaration, to, yahya, in, early, march, 1866, through, a, tablet, penned, in, bah, u, ll, h, s, own, handwriting, and, read, aloud, to, yahya, by, bah, u, ll, h, s, amanuensis, besides, unequivocally, proclaiming, his, spiritual, station, bah, u, ll, h, called, upon, yahya, to, recognize, and, support, him, as, the, b, b, had, explicitly, instructed, him, to, do, mirza, yahya, s, response, was, to, counter, that, he, not, bah, u, ll, h, was, the, promised, manifestation, mentioned, by, the, b, b, this, step, by, yahya, promptly, resulted, in, almost, all, b, b, s, in, adrianople, who, were, already, devoted, to, bah, u, ll, h, deciding, to, have, nothing, further, to, do, with, yahya, or, his, few, supporters, as, news, of, this, development, reached, b, b, s, in, persia, and, iraq, and, surviving, b, b, members, of, the, b, b, s, family, their, response, in, support, of, bah, u, ll, h, was, the, same, mirza, yahya, s, effort, to, claim, a, divine, station, thus, effectively, cleaved, him, from, most, b, b, s, for, it, was, against, the, b, b, s, covenant, with, his, followers, which, decreed, that, whensoever, him, whom, god, shall, make, manifest, announced, himself, all, b, b, s, were, required, to, accept, him, from, this, time, onwards, those, who, understood, the, b, b, s, teachings, about, the, promised, one, began, to, call, themselves, bah, s, meaning, the, people, of, bah, followers, of, bah, u, ll, h, having, lost, all, respect, or, influence, among, b, b, s, who, had, become, bah, s, mirza, yahya, again, sought, to, discredit, bah, u, ll, h, with, ottoman, authorities, accusing, him, of, agitating, against, the, turkish, government, yahya, s, actions, provoked, a, government, investigation, which, cleared, bah, u, ll, h, but, fearing, religious, issues, might, stir, up, future, disorder, the, ottomans, decided, to, imprison, both, bah, u, ll, h, and, mirza, yahya, in, far, flung, outposts, of, their, empire, in, july, 1868, a, royal, decree, condemned, bah, u, ll, h, and, his, family, to, perpetual, imprisonment, in, the, pestilential, penal, colony, of, akk, banished, with, them, were, most, bah, s, in, adrianople, and, a, handful, of, azalis, mirza, yahya, s, intrigue, also, resulted, in, his, own, captivity, because, turkish, authorities, suspected, he, was, involved, in, some, conspiracy, he, was, sent, to, prison, in, famagusta, cyprus, with, his, family, some, azalis, and, four, bah, s, leaving, adrianople, on, 12, august, 1868, bah, u, ll, h, and, his, companions, arrived, in, akk, on, 31, august, where, they, were, incarcerated, in, the,

year, old, son, mirz, mihd, who, fell, through, an, unguarded, skylight, as, he, paced, on, the, roof, of, the, prison, one, evening, while, engrossed, in, prayer, and, meditation, after, a, while, relations, between, bah, prisoners, officials, and, the, local, community, improved, so, conditions, of, their, imprisonment, were, eased, when, visiting, akk, in, april, 1871, dr, thomas, chaplin,

prayers, in, 1890, cambridge, orientalist, edward, granville, browne, was, able, to, interview, bah, u, ll, h, in, bahji, after, this, meeting, he, wrote, his, famous, pen, portrait, of, bah, u, ll,

piercing, eyes, seemed, to, read, one, s, very, soul, power, and, authority, sat, on, that, ample, brow, no, need, to, ask, in, whose, presence, i, stood, as, i, bowed, myself, before, one, who, is, the, object, of, a, devotion, and, love, which, kings, might, envy, and, emperors, sigh, for, in, vain, a, mild, dignified, voice, bade, me, be, seated, and, then, continued, praise, be, to, god, that, thou, hast, attained, thou, hast, come, to, see, a, prisoner, and, an, exile, we, desire, but, the, good, of, the, world, and, the, happiness, of, the, nations, yet, they, deem, us, a, stirrer, up, of, strife, and, sedition, worthy, of, bondage, and, banishment, that, all, nations, should, become, one, in, faith, and, all, men, as, brothers, that, the, bonds, of, affection, and, unity, between, the, sons, of, men, should, be, strengthened, that, diversity, of, religion, should, cease, and, differences, of, race, be, annulled, what, harm, is, there, in, this, yet, so, it, shall, be, these, fruitless, strifes, these, ruinous, wars, shall, pass, away, and, the, most, great, peace, shall, come, is, not, this, that, which, christ, foretold, yet, do, we, see, your, kings, and, rulers, lavishing, their, treasures, more, freely, on, means, for, the, destruction, of, the, human, race, than, on, that, which, would, conduce, to, the, happiness, of, mankind, these, strifes, and, this, bloodshed, and, discord, must, cease, and, all, men, be, as, one, kindred, and, one, family, let, not, a, man, glory, in, this, that, he, loves, his, country, let, him, rather, glory, in, this, that, he, loves, his, kind, after, a, short, illness, bah, u, ll, h, died, on, 29, may, 1892, in, bahji, he, was, buried, adjacent, to, the, mansion, in, an, existing, building, which, now, serves, as, his,

bah, writings, liken, manifestations, to, perfect, mirrors, reflecting, one, sun, though, every, mirror, is, distinct, yet, the, reflection, cast, by, each, is, of, the, same, sun, varying, only, due, to, differences, relating, to, time, and, position, bah, u, ll, h, says, the, guidance, of, manifestations, necessarily, differ, due, to, the, particular, situations, and, requirements, of, those, they, deal, with, the, prophets, of, god, should, be, regarded, as, physicians, whose, task, is, to, foster, the, well, being, of, the, world, and, its, peoples, little, wonder, then, if, the,

affecting, the, sufferer, necessitate, at, every, stage, of, his, sickness, a, special, remedy, in, like, manner, every, time, the, prophets, of, god, have, illumined, the, world, with, the,

process, of, progressive, revelation, to, god, s, eternal, covenant, the, promise, that, every, divine, teacher, makes, with, his, followers, regarding, the, next, manifestation, whom, the, creator, will, send, to, guide, them, prophecies, pertaining, to, this, great, covenant, are, found, in, scriptures, of, all, religions, with, every, manifestation, prophesying, about, the, next, one, and, even, others, to, come, as, for, their, responsibility, in, this, covenant, the, followers, of, each, religion, have, the, duty, to, carefully, investigate, with, an, open, mind, whether, a, person, claiming, to, be, the, promised, new, messenger, of, their, faith, does, or, does, not, spiritually, fulfill, relevant, prophecies, in, announcing, his, claim, to, be, the, promised, manifestation, heralded, by, the, b, b, bah, u, ll, h, also, declared, his, station, as, the, promised, one, prophesied, in, every, major, religion, of, the, past, the, divine, teacher, god, vowed, to, send, to,
