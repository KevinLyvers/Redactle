with, oliver, for, gennett, records, on, april, 5, 6, 1923, they, endured, several, hours, on, the, train, to, remote, richmond, indiana, and, the, band, was, paid, little, the, quality, of, the, performances, was, affected, by, a, lack, of, rehearsal, crude, recording, equipment, bad, acoustics, and, a, cramped, studio, these, early, recordings, were, true, acoustic, the, band, playing, directly, into, a, large, funnel, connected, directly, to, the, needle, making, the, groove, in, the, master, recording, the, much, improved, electrical, recording, system, with, a, better, dynamic, range, was, not, invented, until, 1926, initially, because, armstrong, s, playing, was, so, loud, oliver, could, not, be, heard, on, the, recording, when, he, played, next, to, oliver, armstrong, had, to, stand, 15, feet, from, oliver, in, a, far, corner, of, the, room, to, remedy, this, lil, hardin, whom, armstrong, would, marry, in, 1924, urged, armstrong, to, seek, more, prominent, billing, and, develop, his, style, apart, from, the, influence, of, oliver, at, her, suggestion, armstrong, began, playing, classical, music, in, church, concerts, to, broaden, his, skills, and, dressing, more, stylishly, to, offset, his, girth, her, influence, eventually, undermined, armstrong, s, relationship, with, his, mentor, especially, concerning, his, salary, and, additional, money, that, oliver, held, back, from, armstrong, and, other, band, members, armstrong, s, mother, may, ann, albert, came, to, visit, him, in, chicago, during, the, summer, of, 1923, after, being, told, that, armstrong,

trumpet, to, blend, in, better, with, the, other, musicians, in, his, section, armstrong, s, influence, on, henderson, s, tenor, sax, soloist, coleman, hawkins, can, be, judged, by, listening, to, the, records, made, by, the, band, during, this, period, armstrong, adapted, to, henderson, s, tightly, controlled, style, playing, the, trumpet, and, experimenting, with, the, trombone, the, other,

armstrong, and, his, hot, five, and, recorded, the, hits, potato, head, blues, and, muggles, the, word, muggles, was, a, slang, term, for, marijuana, something, armstrong, often, used, during, his,

broad, minded, always, did, his, best, to, feature, each, individual, among, the, hot, five, and, seven, records, were, cornet, chop, suey, struttin, with, some, barbecue, hotter, than, that, and, potato, head, blues, all, featuring, highly, creative, solos, by, armstrong, according, to, thomas, brothers, recordings, such, as, struttin, with, some, barbeque, were, so, superb, planned, with, density, and, variety, bluesyness, and, showiness, that, the, arrangements, were, probably, showcased, at, the, sunset, caf, his, recordings, soon, after, with, pianist, earl, fatha, hines, their, famous, 1928, weather, bird, duet, and, armstrong, s, trumpet, introduction, to, and, solo, in, west, end, blues, remain, some, of, the, most, influential, improvisations, in, jazz, history, young, trumpet, players, across, the, country, bought, these, recordings, and, memorized, his, solos, armstrong, was, now, free, to, develop, his, style, as, he, wished, which, included, a, heavy, dose, of, effervescent, jive, such, as, whip, that, thing, miss, lil, and, mr, johnny, dodds, aw, do, that, clarinet, boy, armstrong, also, played, with, erskine, tate, s, little, symphony, mostly, at, the, vendome, theatre, they, furnished, music, for, silent, movies, and, live, shows, including, jazz, versions, of, classical, music, such, as, madame, butterfly, which, gave, armstrong, experience, with, longer, forms, of, music, and, with, hosting, before, a, large, audience, he, began, scat, singing, improvised, vocal, jazz, using, nonsensical, words, and, was, among, the, first, to, record, it, on, the, hot, five, recording, heebie, jeebies, in, 1926, the, recording, was, so, popular, that, the, group, became, the, most, famous, jazz, band, in, the, united, states, even, though, they, had,

at, the, sunset, caf, for, al, capone, s, associate, joe, glaser, in, the, carroll, dickerson, orchestra, with, earl, hines, on, piano, which, was, renamed, louis, armstrong, and, his, stompers, however, hines, was, the, music, director, and, glaser, managed, the, orchestra, hines, and, armstrong, became, fast, friends, and, successful, collaborators, it, was, at, the, sunset, caf, that, armstrong, accompanied, singer, adelaide, hall, during, hall, s, tenure, at, the, venue, she, experimented, developed, and, expanded, her, scat, singing, with, armstrong, s, guidance, and, encouragement, in, the, first, half, of, 1927, armstrong, assembled, his, hot, seven, group, which, added, drummer, al, baby, dodds, and, tuba, player, pete, briggs, while, preserving, most, of, his,

newfound, love, of, african, american, culture, the, sound, of, jazz, along, with, musicians, such, as, armstrong, helped, shape, hughes, as, a, writer, just, like, the, musicians, hughes, wrote, his, words, with, jazz, armstrong, changed, jazz, during, the, harlem, renaissance, as, the, world, s, greatest, trumpet, player, during, this, time, armstrong, cemented, his, legacy, and, continued, a,

versions, of, songs, composed, by, his, old, friend, hoagy, carmichael, his, 1930s, recordings, took, full, advantage, of, the, rca, ribbon, microphone, introduced, in, 1931, which, imparted, warmth, to, vocals, and, became, an, intrinsic, part, of, the, crooning, sound, of, artists, like, bing, crosby, armstrong, s, interpretation, of, carmichael, s, stardust, became, one, of, the, most, successful, versions, of, this, song, ever, recorded, showcasing, armstrong, s, unique, vocal, sound, and, style, and, his, innovative, approach, to, singing, songs, that, were, already, standards, armstrong, s, radical, re, working, of, sidney, arodin, and, carmichael, s, lazy, river, recorded, in, 1931, encapsulated, his, groundbreaking, approach, to, melody, and, phrasing, the, song, begins, with, a, brief, trumpet, solo, then, the, main, melody, is, introduced, by, sobbing, horns, memorably, punctuated, by, armstrong, s, growling, interjections, at, the, end, of, each, bar, yeah, uh, huh, sure, way, down, way, down, in, the, first, verse, armstrong, ignores, the, notated, melody, and, sings, as, if, playing, a, trumpet, solo, pitching, most, of, the, first, line, on, a, single, note, and, using, strongly, syncopated, phrasing, in, the, second, stanza, he, breaks, into, an, almost, entirely, improvised, melody, which, then, evolves, into, a, classic, passage, of, armstrong, s, scat, singing, as, with, his, trumpet, playing, armstrong, s, vocal, innovations, served, as, a, foundation, for, jazz, vocal, interpretation, the, uniquely, gravelly, coloration, of, his, voice, became, an, archetype, that, was, endlessly, imitated, armstrong, s, scat, singing, was, enriched, by, his, matchless, experience, as, a, trumpet, soloist, his, resonant, velvety, lower, register, tone, and, bubbling, cadences, on, sides, such, as, lazy, river, greatly, influenced, younger, white, singers, such, as, bing, crosby, the, great, depression, of, the, early, 1930s, was, especially, hard, on, the, jazz, scene, after, a, long, downward, spiral, the, cotton, club, closed, in, 1936, and, many, musicians, stopped, playing, altogether, as, club, dates, evaporated, bix, beiderbecke,

permanently, in, queens, new, york, in, 1943, with, his, fourth, wife, lucille, although, subject, to, the, vicissitudes, of, tin, pan, alley, and, the, gangster, ridden, music, business, as, well, as, anti, black, prejudice, armstrong, continued, to, develop, his, playing, bookings, for, big, bands, tapered, off, during, the, 1940s, due, to, changes, in, public, tastes, ballrooms, closed, and, competition, from, other, types, of, music, especially, pop, vocals, became, more, popular, than, big, band, music, under, such, circumstances, it, became, impossible, to, finance, a, 16, piece, touring, band, a, widespread, revival, of, interest, in, the, 1940s, in, the, traditional, jazz, of, the, 1920s, made, it, possible, for, armstrong, to, consider, a, return, to, the, small, group, musical, style, of, his, youth, armstrong, was, featured, as, a, guest, artist, with, lionel, hampton, s, band, at, the, famed, second, cavalcade, of, jazz, concert, held, at, wrigley, field, in, los,

armstrong, s, manager, joe, glaser, changed, the, armstrong, big, band, on, august, 13, 1947, into, a, six, piece, traditional, jazz, group, featuring, armstrong, with, initially, teagarden, earl,

performances, a, year, making, many, recordings, and, appearing, in, over, 30, films, by, the, 1950s, armstrong, was, a, widely, beloved, american, icon, and, cultural, ambassador, who, commanded, an, international, fanbase, however, a, growing, generation, gap, became, apparent, between, him, and, the, young, jazz, musicians, who, emerged, in, the, postwar, era, such, as, charlie, parker, miles, davis, and, sonny, rollins, the, postwar, generation, regarded, their, music, as, abstract, art, and, considered, armstrong, s, vaudevillian, style, half, musician, and, half, stage, entertainer, outmoded, and, uncle, tomism, he, seemed, a, link, to, minstrelsy, that, we, were, ashamed, of, armstrong, called, bebop, chinese, music, while, touring, australia, in, 1954, he, was, asked, if, he,

live, records, he, is, called, louie, on, stage, such, as, on, the, 1952, can, anyone, explain, from, the, live, album, in, scandinavia, vol, 1, the, same, applies, to, his, 1952, studio, recording, of, the, song, chloe, where, the, choir, in, the, background, sings, louie, louie, with, armstrong, responding, what, was, that, somebody, called, my, name, lewie, is, the, french, pronunciation, of,

as, a, client, armstrong, returned, to, gretna, on, several, occasions, to, visit, her, he, found, the, courage, to, look, for, her, home, to, see, her, away, from, work, there, armstrong, found, out, she, had, a, common, law, husband, not, long, after, that, fiasco, parker, traveled, to, armstrong, s, home, on, perdido, street, they, checked, into, kid, green, s, hotel, that, evening, on, the, next, day, march, 19, 1919, armstrong, and, parker, married, at, city, hall, they, adopted, a, three, year, old, boy, clarence, whose, mother, armstrong, s, cousin, flora, had, died, soon, after, giving, birth, clarence, armstrong, was, mentally, disabled, as, a, result, of, a, head, injury, at, an, early, age, armstrong, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, taking, care, of, him, his, marriage, to, parker, ended, when, they, separated, in, 1923, on, february, 4, 1924, armstrong, married, lil, hardin, armstrong, king, oliver, s, pianist, she, had, divorced, her, first, husband, a, few, years, earlier, armstrong, s, second, wife, helped, him, develop, his, career, but, they, separated, in, 1931, and, divorced, in, 1938, armstrong, then, married, alpha, smith, his, relationship, with, alpha, began, while, he, was, playing, at, the, vendome, during, the, 1920s, and, continued, long, after, armstrong, s, marriage, to, her, lasted, four, years, they, divorced, in, 1942, he, then, married, lucille, wilson, a, singer, at, the, cotton, club, in, new, york, in, october, 1942, they, remained, married, until, his, death, in, 1971, armstrong, s, marriages, produced, no, offspring, however, in, december, 2012, 57, year, old, sharon, preston, folta, claimed, to, be, his, daughter, from, a, 1950s, affair, between, armstrong, and, lucille, sweets, preston, a, dancer, at, the, cotton, club, in, a, 1955, letter, to, his, manager, joe, glaser, armstrong, affirmed, his, belief, that, preston, s, newborn, baby, was, his, daughter, and, ordered, glaser, to, pay, a, monthly, allowance, of, 400, 5, 687, in, 2023, dollars, to, mother, and, child, armstrong, was, colorful, and, charismatic, his, autobiography, vexed, some, biographers, and, historians, because, armstrong, had, a, habit, of, telling, tales, particularly, about, his, early, childhood, when, he, was, less, scrutinized, and, his, embellishments, lack, consistency, in, addition, to, being, an, entertainer, armstrong, was, a, leading, personality, he, was, beloved, by, an, american, public, that, usually, offered, little, access, beyond, their, public, celebrity, to, even, the, most, significant, african, american, performers, and, armstrong, was, able, to, live, a, private, life, of, access, and, privilege, afforded, to, few, other, african, americans, during, that, era, armstrong, generally, remained, politically, neutral, which, sometimes, alienated, him, from, black, community, members, who, expected, him, to, use, his, prominence, within, white, america, to, become, more, outspoken, during, the, civil, rights, movement, however, armstrong, criticized, president, eisenhower, for, not, acting, forcefully, on, civil, rights, the, trumpet, is, notoriously, hard, on, the, lips, and, armstrong, suffered, from, lip, damage, over, most, of, his, life, this, was, due, to, armstrong, s, aggressive, playing, style, and, preference, for, narrow, mouthpieces, that, would, stay, in, place, more, easily, but, tended, to, dig, into, the, soft, flesh, of, his, inner, lip, during, his, 1930s, european, tour, armstrong, suffered, an, ulceration, so, severe, that, he, had, to, stop, playing, entirely, for, a, year, eventually, armstrong, took, to, using, salves, and, creams, on, his, lips, and, also, cutting, off, scar, tissue, with, a, razor, blade, by, the, 1950s, armstrong, was, an, official, spokesman, for, ansatz, creme, lip, salve, during, a, backstage, meeting, with, trombonist, marshall, brown, in, 1959, armstrong, was, advised, to, see, a, doctor, and, receive, proper, treatment, for, his, lips, instead, of, relying, on, home, remedies, however, armstrong, did, not, get, around, to, that, until, his, final, years, by, which, point, his, health, was, failing, and, the, doctors, considered, surgery, too, risky, in, 1959, armstrong, was, hospitalized, for, pneumonia, while, on, tour, in, italy, doctors, were, concerned, about, his, lungs, and, heart, but, by, the, end, of, june, armstrong, rallied, on, the, nicknames, satchmo, and, satch, are, short, for, satchelmouth, the, nickname, origin, is, uncertain, the, most, common, tale, that, biographers, tell, is, the, story, of, armstrong, as, a, young, boy, in, new, orleans, dancing, for, pennies, he, scooped, the, coins, off, the, street, and, stuck, them, into, his, mouth, to, prevent, bigger, children, from, stealing, them, someone, dubbed, armstrong, satchel, mouth, for, his, mouth, acting, as, a, satchel, another, tale, is, that, because, of, his, large, mouth, armstrong, was, nicknamed, satchel, mouth, which, was, shortened, to, satchmo, early, on, armstrong, was, also, known, as, dipper, short, for, dippermouth, a, reference, to, the, piece, dippermouth, blues, and, something, of, a, riff, on, his, unusual, embouchure, the, nickname, pops, came, from, armstrong, s, own, tendency, to, forget, people, s, names, and, simply, call, them, pops, instead, the, nickname, was, turned, on, armstrong, himself, it, was, used, as, the, title, of, a, 2010, biography, of, armstrong, by, terry, teachout, after, a, competition, at, the, savoy, he, was, crowned, and, nicknamed, king, menelik, after, the, emperor, of, ethiopia, for, slaying, ofay, jazz, demons, armstrong, celebrated, his, heritage, as, an, african, american, man, from, a, poor, new, orleans, neighborhood, and, tried, to, avoid, what, he, called, putting, on, airs, many, younger, black, musicians, criticized, armstrong, for, playing, in, front, of, segregated, audiences, and, for, not, taking, a, stronger, stand, in, the, american, civil, rights, movement, when, armstrong, did, speak, out, it, made, national, news, in, 1957, journalism, student, larry, lubenow, scored, a, candid, interview, with, armstrong, while, the, musician, was, performing, in, grand, forks, north, dakota, shortly, after, the, conflict, over, school, desegregation, in, little, rock, arkansas, armstrong, denounced, both, arkansas, governor, orval, faubus, and, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, saying, the, president, had, no, guts, and, was, two, faced, armstrong, told, his, interviewer, that, he, would, cancel, a, planned, tour, of, the, soviet, union, on, behalf, of, the, state, department, saying, the, way, they, re, treating, my, people, in, the, south, the, government, can, go, to, hell, he, could, not, represent, his, government, abroad, when, it, was, in, conflict, with, its, own, people, the, fbi, kept, a, file, on, armstrong, for, his, outspokenness, about, integration, when, asked, about, his, religion, armstrong, answered, that, he, was, raised, a, baptist, always, wore, a, star, of, david, and, was, friends, with, the, pope, armstrong, wore, the, star, of, david, in, honor, of, the, karnoffsky, family, who, took, him, in, as, a, child, and, lent, him, money, to, buy, his, first, cornet, armstrong, was, baptized, a, catholic, in, the, sacred, heart, of, jesus, church, in, new, orleans, and, he, met, pope, pius, xii, and, pope, paul, vi, armstrong, was, concerned, with, his, health, armstrong, used, laxatives, to, control, his, weight, a, practice, he, advocated, both, to, acquaintances, and, in, the, diet, plans, he, published, under, the, title, lose, weight, the, satchmo, way, armstrong, s, laxative, of, preference, in, his, younger, days, was, pluto, water, but, when, he, discovered, the, herbal, remedy, swiss, kriss, he, became, an, enthusiastic, convert, extolling, its, virtues, to, anyone, who, would, listen, and, passing, out, packets, to, everyone, he, encountered, including, members, of, the, british, royal, family, armstrong, also, appeared, in, humorous, risqu, cards, that, he, had, printed, to, send, to, friends, the, cards, bore, a, picture, of, armstrong, sitting, on, a, toilet, as, viewed, through, a, keyhole, with, the, slogan, satch, says, leave, it, all, behind, ya, the, cards, have, sometimes, been, incorrectly, described, as, ads, for, swiss, kriss, in, a, live, recording, of, baby, it, s, cold, outside, with, velma, middleton, he, changes, the, lyric, from, put, another, record, on, while, i, pour, to, take, some, swiss, kriss, while, i, pour, armstrong, s, laxative, use, began, as, a, child, when, his, mother, would, collect, dandelions, and, peppergrass, around, the, railroad, tracks, to, give, to, her, children, for, their, health, armstrong, was, a, heavy, marijuana, smoker, for, much, of, his, life, and, spent, nine, days, in, jail, in, 1930, after, being, arrested, outside, a, club, for, drug, possession, armstrong, described, marijuana, as, a, thousand, times, better, than, whiskey, the, concern, with, armstrong, s, health, and, weight, was, balanced, by, his, love, of, food, reflected, in, such, songs, as, cheesecake, cornet, chop, suey, and, struttin, with, some, barbecue, though, the, latter, was, written, about, a, fine, looking, companion, and, not, food, armstrong, kept, a, strong, connection, throughout, his, life, to, the, cooking, of, new, orleans, always, signing, his, letters, red, beans, and, ricely, yours, a, fan, of, major, league, baseball, armstrong, founded, a, team, in, new, orleans, that, was, known, as, raggedy, nine, and, transformed, the, team, into, his, armstrong, s, secret, nine, baseball, armstrong, s, gregariousness, extended, to, writing, on, the, road, he, wrote, constantly, sharing, favorite, themes, of, his, life, with, correspondents, around, the, world, armstrong, avidly, typed, or, wrote, on, whatever, stationery, was, at, hand, recording, instant, takes, on, music, sex, food, childhood, memories, his, heavy, medicinal, marijuana, use, and, even, his, bowel, movements, which, armstrong, gleefully, described, louis, armstrong, was, not, as, claimed, a, freemason, although, he, has, been, cited, as, a, montgomery, lodge, no, 18, prince, hall, member, in, new, york, no, such, lodge, ever, existed, in, his, autobiography, armstrong, stated, that, he, was, a, member, of, the, knights, of, pythias, of, north, america, south, america, europe, asia, africa, and, australia, an, african, american, non, masonic, fraternal, organization, during, the, krewe, s, 1949, mardi, gras, parade, armstrong, presided, as, king, of, the, zulu, social, aid, pleasure, club, for, which, he, was, featured, on, the, cover, of, time, magazine, in, his, early, years, armstrong, was, best, known, for, his, virtuosity, with, the, cornet, and, trumpet, along, with, his, clarinet, like, figurations, and, high, notes, in, his, cornet, solos, armstrong, was, also, known, for, his, intense, rhythmic, swing, a, complex, conception, involving, accented, upbeats, upbeat, to, downbeat, slurring, and, complementary, relations, among, rhythmic, patterns, the, most, lauded, recordings, on, which, armstrong, plays, trumpet, include, the, hot, five, and, hot, seven, sessions, as, well, as, those, of, the, red, onion, jazz, babies, armstrong, s, improvisations, while, unconventionally, sophisticated, for, that, era, were, also, subtle, and, highly, melodic, the, solo, that, armstrong, plays, during, the, song, potato, head, blues, has, long, been, considered, his, best, solo, of, that, series, prior, to, armstrong, most, collective, ensembles, playing, in, jazz, along, with, its, occasional, solos, simply, varied, the, melodies, of, the, songs, he, was, virtually, the, first, to, create, significant, variations, based, on, the, chord, harmonies, of, the, songs, instead, of, merely, on, the, melodies, this, opened, a, rich, field, for, creation, and, improvisation, and, significantly, changed, the, music, into, a, soloist, s, art, form, often, armstrong, re, composed, pop, tunes, he, played, simply, with, variations, that, made, them, more, compelling, to, jazz, listeners, of, the, era, at, the, same, time, armstrong, s, oeuvre, includes, many, original, melodies, creative, leaps, and, relaxed, or, driving, rhythms, his, playing, technique, honed, by, constant, practice, extended, the, range, tone, and, capabilities, of, the, trumpet, in, his, records, armstrong, almost, single, handedly, created, the, role, of, the, jazz, soloist, taking, what, had, been, essentially, a, piece, of, collective, folk, music, and, turning, it, into, an, art, form, with, tremendous, possibilities, for, individual, expression, armstrong, was, one, of, the, first, artists, to, use, recordings, of, his, performances, to, improve, himself, armstrong, was, an, avid, audiophile, he, had, a, large, collection, of, recordings, including, reel, to, reel, tapes, which, he, took, on, the, road, with, him, in, a, trunk, during, his, later, career, armstrong, enjoyed, listening, to, his, own, recordings, and, comparing, his, performances, musically, in, the, den, of, his, home, armstrong, had, the, latest, audio, equipment, and, would, sometimes, rehearse, and, record, along, with, his, older, recordings, or, the, radio, as, armstrong, s, music, progressed, and, popularity, grew, his, singing, also, became, very, important, armstrong, was, not, the, first, to, record, scat, singing, but, he, was, masterful, at, it, and, helped, popularize, it, with, the, first, recording, on, which, he, scatted, heebie, jeebies, at, a, recording, session, for, okeh, records, when, the, sheet, music, supposedly, fell, on, the, floor, and, the, music, began, before, armstrong, could, pick, up, the, pages, he, simply, started, singing, nonsense, syllables, while, okeh, president, e, a, fearn, who, was, at, the, session, kept, telling, him, to, continue, armstrong, did, thinking, the, track, would, be, discarded, but, that, was, the, version, that, was, pressed, to, disc, sold, and, became, an, unexpected, hit, although, the, story, was, thought, to, be, apocryphal, armstrong, himself, confirmed, it, in, at, least, one, interview, as, well, as, in, his, memoirs, on, a, later, recording, armstrong, also, sang, out, i, done, forgot, the, words, in, the, middle, of, recording, i, m, a, ding, dong, daddy, from, dumas, such, records, were, hits, and, scat, singing, became, a, major, part, of, his, performances, long, before, this, armstrong, was, playing, around, with, his, vocals, shortening, and, lengthening, phrases, interjecting, improvisations, and, using, his, voice, as, creatively, as, his, trumpet, armstrong, once, told, cab, calloway, that, his, scat, style, was, derived, from, the, jews, rockin, an, orthodox, jewish, style, of, chanting, during, prayer, armstrong, was, a, gifted, composer, who, wrote, more, than, 50, songs, some, of, which, have, become, jazz, standards, e, g, gully, low, blues, potato, head, blues, and, swing, that, music, during, his, long, career, armstrong, played, and, sang, with, some, of, the, most, important, instrumentalists, and, vocalists, of, the, time, including, bing, crosby, duke, ellington, fletcher, henderson, earl, hines, jimmie, rodgers, bessie, smith, and, ella, fitzgerald, his, influence, upon, crosby, is, particularly, important, with, regard, to, the, subsequent, development, of, popular, music, crosby, admired, and, copied, armstrong, as, is, evident, on, many, of, his, early, recordings, notably, just, one, more, chance, 1931, the, new, grove, dictionary, of, jazz, describes, crosby, s, debt, to, armstrong, in, precise, detail, although, it, does, not, acknowledge, armstrong, by, name, crosby, was, important, in, introducing, into, the, mainstream, of, popular, singing, an, afro, american, concept, of, song, as, a, lyrical, extension, of, speech, his, techniques, easing, the, weight, of, the, breath, on, the, vocal, cords, passing, into, a, head, voice, at, a, low, register, using, forward, production, to, aid, distinct, enunciation, singing, on, consonants, a, practice, of, black, singers, and, making, discreet, use, of, appoggiaturas, mordents, and, slurs, to, emphasize, the, text, were, emulated, by, nearly, all, later, popular, singers, armstrong, recorded, two, albums, with, ella, fitzgerald, ella, and, louis, and, ella, and, louis, again, for, verve, records, the, sessions, featured, the, backing,
