duke, of, orl, ans, as, regent, of, france, cardinal, fleury, was, chief, minister, from, 1726, until, his, death, in, 1743, at, which, time, the, king, took, sole, control, of, the, kingdom, his, reign, of, almost, 59, years, from, 1715, to, 1774, was, the, second, longest, in, the, history, of, france, exceeded, only, by, his, predecessor, louis, xiv, who, had, ruled, for, 72, years, from, 1643, to, 1715, in, 1748, louis, returned, the, austrian, netherlands, won, at, the, battle, of, fontenoy, of, 1745, he, ceded, new, france, in, north, america, to, great, britain, and, spain, at,

historians, generally, criticize, his, reign, citing, how, reports, of, his, corruption, embarrassed, the, monarchy, while, his, wars, drained, the, treasury, and, produced, little, gain, however, a, minority, of, scholars, argue, that, he, was, popular, during, his, lifetime, but, that, his, reputation, was, later, blackened, by, revolutionary, propaganda, his, grandson, and, successor, louis, xvi, inherited, a, large, kingdom, in, need, of, financial, and, political, reform, which, would, ultimately, lead, to, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, louis, xv, was, the, great, grandson, of, louis, xiv, and, the, third, son, of, the, duke, of, burgundy, 1682, 1712, and, his, wife, marie, ad, la, de, of, savoy, who, was, the, eldest, daughter, of, victor, amadeus, ii, duke, of, savoy, he, was, born, in, the, palace, of, versailles, on, 15, february, 1710, and, was, immediately, styled, the, duke, of, anjou, at, this, time, the, possibility, of, the, duke, of, anjou, becoming, the, next, king, seemed, rather, remote, as, louis, xiv, s, eldest, son, and, heir, louis, s, paternal, grandfather, louis, le, grand, dauphin, was, expected, to, assume, the, throne, upon, the, old, king, s, death, next, in, line, to, the, throne, behind, the, grand, dauphin, was, his, eldest, son, louis, s, father, le, petit, dauphin, and, then, louis, s, elder, brother, a, child, named, louis, duke, of, brittany, disease, however, steered, the, line, of, succession, forward, three, generations, and, sideways, on, 14, april, 1711, the, grand, dauphin, died, of, smallpox, and, less, than, a, year, later, on, 12, february, 1712, the, future, king, s, mother, marie, ad, la, de, who, had, been, stricken, with, measles, died, followed, six, days, later, by, louis, s, father, her, devoted, husband, who, would, not, leave, her, side, during, her, illness, with, the, death, of, both, the, grand, and, petit, dauphins, louis, s, elder, brother, immediately, became, dauphin, of, france, but, just, over, two, weeks, further, still, on, 7, march, it, was, found, that, both, the, elder, louis, and, the, younger, louis, had, also, contracted, measles, the, two, brothers, were, treated, in, the, traditional, way, with, bloodletting, on, the, night, of, 8, 9, march, the, new, dauphin, age, five, died, from, the, combination, of, the, disease, and, the, treatment, the, governess, of, louis, madame, de, ventadour, forbade, the, doctors, to, bleed, the, two, year, old, duke, of, anjou, by, hiding, him, in, a, palace, closet, where, she, cared, for, him, alone, where, he, survived, despite, being, very, ill, when, louis, xiv, himself, finally, died, on, 1, september, 1715, louis, at, the, age, of, five, trembling, and, crying, and, against, all, probability, inherited, the, throne, as, louis, xv, according, to, charles, v, s, royal, ordinance, of, 1374, the, kingdom, of, france, must, be, governed, by, a, regent, until, a, given, king, had, reached, the, age, of, 13, the, title, of, regent, was, customarily, assigned, to, an, under, aged, king, s, nearest, adult, living, relative, often, his, mother, or, an, uncle, but, as, louis, s, mother, had, been, struck, down, by, disease, and, as, his, only, uncle, had, already, been, enthroned, as, king, of, spain, the, job, fell, to, his, great, uncle, philippe, ii, duke, of, orl, ans, however, louis, xiv, had, distrusted, philippe, who, was, a, renowned, soldier, but, was, regarded, by, the, late, king, as, an, atheist, and, libertine, the, king, referred, privately, to, philippe, as, a, fanfaron, des, crimes, braggart, of, crimes, louis, xiv, had, desired, for, france, to, be, ruled, by, his, favorite, but, illegitimate, son, the, duke, of, maine, illegitimate, son, of, louis, xiv, and, madame, de, montespan, who, was, in, the, council, and, who, because, of, a, dramatic, change, in, the, laws, of, succession, instituted, by, louis, xiv, and, as, his, oldest, surviving, male, descendant, could, now, legally, become, king, if, the, legitimate, direct, line, of, succession, became, extinguished, in, august, 1714, shortly, before, his, own, death, the, king, rewrote, his, will, to, restrict, the, powers, of, the, regent, it, stipulated, that, the, nation, was, to, be, governed, by, a, regency, council, made, up, of, fourteen, members, until, the, new, king, reached, the, age, of, majority, philippe, nephew, of, louis, xiv, was, named, president, of, this, council, but, other, members, included, the, duke, of, maine, and, at, least, seven, of, his, well, known, allies, according, to, the, will, all, decisions, were, to, be, made, by, majority, vote, meaning, that, the, president, could, always, be, outvoted, by, maine, s, party, and, effectively, allowing, maine, to, rule, france, for, the, next, eight, years, philippe, saw, the, trap, the, parlement, of, paris, an, assembly, of, french, nobles, among, whom, philippe, had, many, friends, was, the, only, judicial, body, in, france, with, the, authority, to, have, this, portion, of, the, deceased, king, s, will, annulled, and, immediately, after, the, king, s, death, philippe, approached, the, parlement, requesting, that, they, do, just, this, in, exchange, for, their, support, he, agreed, to, restore, to, the, parlement, its, droit, de, remontrance, right, of, remonstrance, the, right, to, challenge, a, king, s, decisions, which, had, been, removed, by, louis, xiv, the, droit, de, remontrance, would, impair, the, monarchy, s, functioning, and, marked, the, beginning, of, a, conflict, between, the, parlement, and, king, which, contributed, to, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, in, the, mean, time, however, the, will, was, annulled, and, philippe, was, installed, as, regent, with, full, powers, to, act, in, the, name, of, the, king, in, all, matters, on, 9, september, 1715, philippe, had, the, young, king, transported, away, from, the, court, in, versailles, to, paris, where, the, regent, had, his, own, residence, in,

of, jansenism, a, catholic, doctrine, based, largely, on, the, teachings, of, saint, augustine, jansenism, had, attracted, many, important, followers, in, france, including, the, philosopher, blaise,

were, threatened, with, prison, and, banishment, as, a, result, of, these, repressive, acts, religious, dissent, remained, an, issue, throughout, the, king, s, reign, tension, grew, between, the, duke, of, bourbon, and, cardinal, de, fleury, over, the, king, s, favor, the, duke, s, rigid, and, cold, personality, did, not, appeal, to, the, young, king, who, turned, to, his, old, tutor, for, advice, on, how, to, run, the, affairs, of, state, when, the, king, insisted, that, fleury, was, to, be, included, in, all, meetings, between, himself, and, the, duke, of, bourbon, the, duke, was, infuriated, and, began, to, undermine, fleury, s, position, at, court, when, the, king, became, aware, of, the, duke, s, intrigue, he, abruptly, dismissed, him, and, replaced, him, with, fleury, from, 1726, until, his, death, in, 1743, fleury, effectively, ruled, france, with, the, king, s, assent, fleury, dictated, the, choices, to, be, made, and, encouraged, the, king, s, indecision, and,

educated, at, the, abbey, of, fontevrault, on, the, surface, it, was, the, most, peaceful, and, prosperous, period, of, the, reign, of, louis, xv, but, it, was, built, upon, a, growing, volcano, of, opposition, particularly, from, the, noble, members, of, the, parlements, who, saw, their, privileges, and, power, reduced, fleury, made, the, papal, doctrine, unigenitus, part, of, french, law, and, forbade, any, debate, in, parlement, which, caused, the, silent, opposition, to, grow, he, also, downplayed, the, importance, of, the, french, navy, which, would, prove, be, a, fatal, mistake, in, future, conflicts, fleury, showed, the, king, the, virtues, of, a, stable, government, he, kept, the, same, minister, of, war, bauyn, d, angervilliers, and, controller, of, the, currency, philibert,

successor, philibert, orry, substantially, reduced, the, debt, caused, by, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, and, simplified, and, made, more, fair, the, tax, system, though, he, still, had, to, depend, upon, the, unpopular, dixieme, or, tax, of, the, tenth, of, the, revenue, of, every, citizen, orry, managed, in, the, last, two, years, of, fleury, s, government, to, balance, the, royal, budget, an, accomplishment, never, again, repeated, during, the, rest, of, the, reign, fleury, s, government, expanded, commerce, both, within, france, and, with, the, rest, of, the, world,

minister, jean, baptiste, de, machault, d, arnouville, and, the, minister, of, the, armies, comte, d, argenson, with, the, end, of, the, war, louis, decided, to, take, the, opportunity, to, reduce, the, debt, and, modernize, the, system, of, taxation, of, the, kingdom, the, package, of, reforms, was, put, together, by, his, finance, minister, d, arnouville, and, was, approved, by, the, king, and, presented, in, two, decrees, issued, in, may, 1749, the, first, measure, was, an, issue, of, bonds, paying, five, percent, interest, to, pay, off, the, 36, million, livres, of, debt, caused, by, the, cost, of, the, war, this, new, measure, was, an, immediate, success, the, second, measure, was, the, abolition, of, the, dixi, me, a, tax, of, ten, percent, of, revenue, which, had, been, created, to, finance, the, war, and, its, replacement, by, the, vingti, me, a, tax, of, five, percent, on, net, revenue, which, unlike, the, dixi, me, taxed, the, income, of, all, french, citizens, including, for, the, first, time, the, income, from, the, property, of, the, clergy, and, the, nobility, while, the, new, tax, was, supported, by, many, including, voltaire, it, met, immediate, and, fierce, resistance, from, both, the, nobility, and, the, church, when, on, 5, may, 1749, it, was, presented, for, formal, registration, to, the, parlement, of, paris, the, assembly, composed, of, high, nobles, and, wealthy, parisians, who, had, purchased, seats, it, was, rejected, by, a, vote, of, one, hundred, and, six, to, forty, nine, the, majority, asked, for, more, time, to, consider, the, project, the, king, responded, by, demanding, immediate, registration, which, the, parlement, reluctantly, granted, on, 19, may, resistance, to, the, new, measures, grew, with, the, church, and, in, the, provinces, which, had, their, own, parlements, while, the, parlements, of, burgundy, provence, and, artois, bowed, to, the, king, s, demands, brittany, and, languedoc, refused, the, royal, government, closed, down, the, parlement, of, brittany, ordered, the, members, of, the, parlement, of, languedoc, to, return, to, their, estates, and, parishes, and, took, direct, control, of, the, provence, within, paris, the, battle, between, the, king, and, parlement, was, fought, over, the, status, of, the, h, pital, g, n, ral, a, semi, religious, organization, which, operated, six, different, hospitals, and, shelters, in, paris, with, a, staff, of, some, five, thousand, persons, many, of, the, hospital, staff, and, officials, were, jansenists, while, the, board, of, directors, of, the, hospital, included, many, prominent, members, of, the, parlement, of, paris, in, 1749, the, king, decided, to, purge, the, hospital, of, jansenists, and, corruption, appointed, a, new, sup, rieure, against, the, will, of, the, administrators, who, resigned, then, appointed, four, temporary, administrators, and, asked, the, first, president, of, the, parlement, of, paris, ren, nicolas, charles, augustin, de, maupeou, to, implement, his, decree, for, the, reorganization, of, the, hospital, de, maupeou, refused, to, carry, out, the, decree, without, the, authorization, of, the, parlement, and, the, parlement, without, taking, any, action, went, on, vacation, on, 20, november, when, the, parlement, returned, the, king, again, summoned, de, maupeou, for, an, audience, and, again, demanded, action, without, delay, this, time, the, parlement, members, met, but, refused, to, discuss, the, hospital, on, 28, january, 1752, the, king, instructed, the, grand, council, to, change, the, administration, of, the, hospital, without, the, approval, of, the, parlement, voltaire, describing, the, affair, wrote, never, before, has, such, a, small, affair, caused, such, a, great, emotion, of, the, spirit, it, was, the, first, overt, disobedience, of, the, legislature, against, the, king, and, one, of, the, first, signs, that, the, parlement, believed, it, not, the, king, was, the, legitimate, source, of, laws, in, the, nation, the, king, s, original, plans, to, tax, the, church, also, ran, into, difficulty, a, royal, decree, ordered, all, the, clergy, to, submit, a, declaration, of, their, revenue, by, 17, february, 1751, but, that, day, passed, without, any, declarations, given, instead, it, became, known, that, the, king, had, quietly, issued, a, new, decree, in, december, 1750, canceling, the, tax, and, relying, again, entirely, on, the, don, gratuit, the, voluntary, donation, by, the, church, of, 1, 500, 000, livres, under, the, new, decree, instead, of, a, tax, the, church, would, each, year, collect, a, comparable, sum, and, donate, it, freely, to, the, government, his, support, for, the, church, came, both, from, the, teachings, of, his, tutor, cardinal, fleury, and, his, gratitude, to, archbishop, de, beaumont, who, defended, him, against, the, attacks, of, the, jansenists, and, the, criticisms, of, the, parlement, and, the, archbishop, s, tolerance, of, the, king, s, own, personal, life, and, mistresses, despite, the, french, victories, the, war, dragged, on, both, in, the, netherlands, and, in, italy, where, mar, chal, belle, isle, was, besieging, the, austrians, in, genoa, by, the, summer, of, 1747, france, occupied, the, entire, austrian, netherlands, modern, day, belgium, in, march, 1748, louis, proposed, a, conference, in, aix, la, chapelle, to, bring, the, war, to, an, end, the, process, was, advanced, by, the, capture, of, maastricht, by, the, mar, chal, de, saxe, on, 10, april, 1748, britain, pressed, by, the, threat, of, a, french, invasion, of, the, rest, of, the, netherlands, urged, a, quick, settlement, despite, objections, from, austria, and, sardinia, the, treaty, was, quickly, negotiated, and, signed, by, all, the, parties, in, september, and, october, 1748, louis, was, also, eager, for, a, quick, settlement, because, the, naval, war, with, britain, was, extremely, costly, to, french, maritime, trade, the, proposition, of, louis, was, surprisingly, generous, in, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, louis, offered, to, return, all, of, the, territories, he, had, conquered, in, the, netherlands, to, the, austrians, maastricht, to, the, dutch, nice, and, savoy, to, the, sardinians, and, madras, in, india, to, the, english, the, austrians, would, give, the, duchy, of, parma, and, some, other, territory, to, the, spanish, infante, philip, while, britain, would, return, to, france, louisbourg, and, the, island, of, cape, breton, france, also, agreed, to, expel, the, stuart, pretender, charles, edward, stuart, from, its, territory, the, end, of, the, war, had, caused, celebration, in, paris, but, the, publication, of, the, details, of, the, treaty, on, 14, january, 1749, caused, dismay, and, anger, the, stuart, pretender, charles, edward, stuart, refused, to, leave, paris, and, was, acclaimed, by, the, parisians, he, was, finally, arrested, on, 10, december, 1748, and, transported, by, force, to, switzerland, the, french, military, commanders, including, de, saxe, were, furious, about, giving, up, the, austrian, netherlands, the, king, s, defense, of, his, action, was, practical, he, did, not, want, the, netherlands, to, be, a, permanent, source, of, contention, between, france, and, other, powers, he, also, felt, that, france, had, already, reached, its, proper, borders, and, it, was, better, to, cultivate, its, prosperity, rather, than, make, it, larger, his, basis, was, also, religious, he, had, been, taught, by, fleury, that, the, seventh, commandment, forbade, taking, the, property, of, others, by, fraud, or, violence, louis, often, cited, a, latin, maxim, declaring, if, anyone, who, asks, by, what, means, he, can, best, defend, a, kingdom, the, answer, is, by, never, wishing, to, augment, it, he, also, received, support, from, voltaire, who, wrote, it, seems, better, and, even, more, useful, for, the, court, of, france, to, think, about, the, happiness, of, its, allies, rather, than, to, be, given, two, or, three, flemish, towns, which, would, have, been, the, eternal, object, of, jealousy, louis, lacked, the, communicative, skills, to, explain, his, decision, to, the, french, public, and, further, did, not, see, any, need, to, do, so, the, news, that, the, king, had, returned, the, southern, netherlands, to, austria, was, met, with, disbelief, and, bitterness, the, french, obtained, so, little, of, what, they, had, fought, for, that, they, adopted, the, expressions, b, te, comme, la, paix, stupid, as, the, peace, and, travailler, pour, le, roi, de, prusse, to, work, for, the, king, of, prussia, i, e, working, for, nothing, louis, had, been, very, much, in, love, with, the, queen, and, they, were, inseparable, in, the, early, years, of, his, reign, but, as, his, family, grew, and, the, queen, was, constantly, pregnant, or, exhausted, by, her, maternities, he, began, to, look, elsewhere, he, first, became, attached, to, one, of, the, ladies, of, the, queen, s, court, louise, julie, de, mailly, who, was, the, same, age, as, he, and, from, an, ancient, noble, family, without, courtship, or, ceremony, he, made, her, his, mistress, and, raised, her, to, the, rank, of, duchess, the, duke, of, luynes, commented, on, the, king, s, behavior, the, king, loves, women, and, yet, there, is, absolutely, no, gallantry, in, his, spirit, in, 1738, after, the, queen, lost, an, unborn, child, her, doctors, forbade, her, to, have, relations, with, the, king, for, a, time, the, king, was, offended, by, her, refusal, and, thereafter, never, shared, her, bed, acknowledging, that, he, was, committing, adultery, louis, refused, thereafter, to, go, to, confession, and, to, take, the, sacrament, the, cardinal, de, fleury, tried, to, persuade, him, to, confess, and, to, give, up, his, mistress, but, without, success, in, 1738, the, king, turned, his, attentions, to, the, sister, of, louise, julie, pauline, f, licit, de, mailly, pauline, f, licit, became, pregnant, in, 1740, allegedly, by, the, king, and, subsequently, died, during, childbirth, the, illegitimate, son, of, the, king, and, pauline, f, licit, came, to, be, known, as, demi, louis, due, to, his, visual, resemblance, to, his, father, who, took, care, of, his, financial, needs, but, gave, him, little, attention, pauline, f, licit, s, death, caused, the, king, to, go, into, mourning, and, for, a, time, he, turned, to, religion, for, consolation, when, the, king, finally, recovered, his, spirits, louise, julie, introduced, the, king, to, her, youngest, sister, marie, anne, de, mailly, the, king, was, immediately, attracted, to, marie, anne, however, she, insisted, that, he, expel, her, older, sister, from, the, court, before, she, would, become, his, mistress, the, king, gave, in, and, on, 4, october, 1742, marie, anne, was, named, a, lady, of, the, court, of, the, queen, and, a, month, later, the, king, ordered, her, older, sister, to, leave, the, court, and, to, live, in, paris, the, king, made, his, new, mistress, the, duchess, of, ch, teauroux, the, king, s, relationships, with, the, sisters, became, a, subject, of, gossip, in, the, court, and, in, paris, where, a, popular, comic, poem, was, recited, ending, choosing, an, entire, family, is, that, being, unfaithful, or, constant, in, june, 1744, the, king, left, versailles, in, order, to, take, personal, command, of, his, armies, fighting, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, this, otherwise, popular, move, was, marred, by, the, king, s, indiscreet, decision, to, bring, along, marie, anne, when, marie, anne, visited, the, king, in, metz, in, august, 1744, she, was, accompanied, by, her, sister, diane, ad, la, de, de, mailly, while, an, amiable, companion, marie, anne, did, not, consider, her, simple, sister, to, be, much, of, a, rival, however, it, was, rumored, at, the, time, that, one, of, the, methods, by, which, marie, anne, kept, the, interest, of, the, king, was, to, periodically, offer, him, a, m, nage, trois, with, diane, ad, la, de, these, widespread, rumors, made, the, sisters, visit, to, the, king, in, metz, a, national, scandal, and, during, their, notorious, visit, the, king, suddenly, fell, gravely, ill, death, appeared, imminent, yet, the, king, s, chaplain, refused, him, absolution, unless, he, renounced, his, mistress, which, he, did, marie, anne, left, the, court, and, after, the, king, recovered, he, made, a, triumphal, entry, into, paris, on, 25, november, minister, maurepas, was, obliged, to, recall, marie, anne, to, versailles, but, she, soon, fell, sick, with, convulsive, pains, and, died, on, 8, december, 1744, following, her, death, the, king, consoled, himself, with, diane, ad, la, de, until, he, met, madame, de, pompadour, in, 1745, the, king, s, adultery, confession, which, was, distributed, publicly, embarrassed, him, and, tarnished, the, prestige, of, the, monarchy, although, louis, xv, s, recovery, earned, him, the, epithet, well, beloved, from, a, public, relieved, by, his, survival, the, events, at, metz, diminished, his, standing, the, military, successes, of, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, inclined, the, french, public, to, overlook, louis, adulteries, but, after, 1748, in, the, wake, of, the, anger, over, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, pamphlets, against, the, king, s, mistresses, were, widely, distributed, and, read, jeanne, antoinette, poisson, better, known, as, madame, de, pompadour, was, the, most, famous, and, influential, of, the, mistresses, of, louis, xv, she, was, the, illegitimate, daughter, of, a, paris, fermier, general, and, was, married, to, a, banker,

him, choose, or, demote, ministers, her, opinions, led, to, the, downfall, of, some, very, competent, ministers, including, machault, d, aurnouville, and, the, marquis, d, argenson, and, to, the, promotion, of, a, number, of, incompetent, military, commanders, her, most, successful, choice, was, the, promotion, of, the, duke, de, choiseul, who, became, one, of, the, king, s, most, effective, ministers, she, ceased, to, be, sexually, active, with, the, king, in, 1750, but, remained, his, closest, advisor, and, titular, mistress, she, was, promoted, to, duchess, in, 1752, and, dame, of,

against, the, jesuits, began, in, 1760, in, the, provincial, parlements, where, the, gallicans, supporters, of, a, specifically, french, version, of, catholicism, were, strong, the, complaint, against, the, jesuits, was, that, they, were, independent, of, the, authority, of, the, king, and, the, hierarchy, of, the, church, in, france, the, jesuits, had, already, been, expelled, from,

to, obey, in, truth, no, one, except, god, can, compel, you, to, obey, this, sacred, pact, but, we, can, ask, you, with, respect, with, submission, to, keep, your, promises, this, was, too, much, for, the, king, he, responded, on, 31, january, 1761, that, the, parlement, s, complaint, contained, principles, so, false, and, so, contrary, to, my, authority, and, with, expressions, so, indecent,

that, he, was, giving, his, silver, service, to, the, mint, to, be, melted, down, and, made, into, money, the, new, controller, of, finances, henri, bertin, a, protege, of, madame, de, pompadour,

began, to, hold, a, salon, which, attracted, writers, and, aristocrats, since, jean, du, barry, was, already, married, to, give, her, legitimacy, he, arranged, for, her, to, become, engaged, to, his, brother, comte, guillaume, du, barry, a, retired, soldier, they, were, married, on, 1, september, 1768, and, then, without, consummating, the, marriage, guillaume, retired, to, his, home, in, languedoc, through, her, acquaintances, with, the, nobility, she, was, invited, to, versailles, where, the, king, saw, her, and, was, immediately, attracted, to, her, he, invited, her, to, fontainebleau, and, then, asked, her, to, live, in, the, palace, of, versailles, her, appearance, at, the, court, scandalized, the, duke, de, choiseul, but, pleased, the, enemies, of, the, duke, within, the, court, for, du, barry, to, be, presented, at, court, she, had, to, be, formally, presented, by, a, member, of, the, nobility, the, elderly, contesse, de, b, arn, was, persuaded, to, make,

large, reception, the, following, day, which, all, the, court, except, du, barry, attended, the, king, soon, installed, her, in, the, palace, of, versailles, and, in, 1771, gave, her, the, new, pavillon, de, louveciennes, choiseul, sowed, a, strong, dislike, for, du, barry, as, did, marie, antoinette, who, arrived, in, versailles, and, married, the, dauphin, on, 16, may, 1770, she, described, the, comtesse, as, the, most, stupid, and, impertinent, creature, imaginable, however, the, king, kept, du, barry, close, to, him, until, the, final, days, before, his, death, when, he, sent, her, away, before, he, made, confession, the, presence, of, du, barry, at, the, court, scandalized, the, high, members, of, the, aristocracy, outside, the, court, the, opponents, of, the, king, in, the, parlements, used, her, presence, to, ridicule, and, attack, the, king, she, was, the, target, of, dozens, of, scandalous, pamphlets, accusing, her, of, every, possible, immoral, act, decades, later, during, the, reign, of, terror, of, the, french, revolution, the, comtesse, was, targeted, by, the, jacobins, as, a, symbol, of, the, hated, old, regime, she, was, guillotined, on, 8, december,

reverted, to, france, after, his, death, and, was, officially, joined, to, the, kingdom, 27, 28, march, 1766, the, acquisition, of, corsica, was, more, complicated, the, island, formally, belonged, to, the, republic, of, genoa, but, an, independent, republic, of, corsica, had, been, proclaimed, in, 1755, by, pasquale, paoli, and, the, rebels, controlled, most, of, the, island, the, republic, of, genoa, did, not, have, the, military, forces, to, conquer, the, island, and, permitted, louis, to, send, french, troops, to, occupy, the, ports, and, major, cities, to, keep, the, island, from, falling, into, british, hands, when, the, war, ended, the, island, was, formally, granted, to, france, by, treaty, of, versailles, on, 19, may, 1768, louis, sent, the, army, to, subdue, the, corsican, rebels, the, army, on, the, island, eventually, numbered, twenty, seven, thousand, soldiers, in, may, 1769, the, corsican, rebels, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, ponte, novu, and, paoli, took,

best, known, economist, in, france, he, was, the, king, s, doctor, and, treated, madame, de, pompadour, but, was, also, a, celebrated, economic, theorist, whose, collected, writings, tableau, conomique, 1758, were, avidly, read, by, the, king, and, his, court, louis, referred, to, him, as, my, thinker, his, students, included, the, marquis, de, mirabeau, and, adam, smith, he, was, a, critic, of, government, regulation, and, coined, the, term, bureaucracy, literally, a, government, of, desks, the, other, was, his, disciple, the, minister, of, the, commerce, of, the, king, jacques, claude, marie, vincent, de, gournay, the, two, men, advocated, removing, as, many, restrictions, as, possible, from, the, economy, to, encourage, greater, production, and, trade, de, gournay, s, famous, expression, laissez, faire, laissez, passer, let, it, be, done, let, it, pass, was, later, adopted, as, the, slogan, of, a, whole, school, of, free, market, economics, de, gournay, and, quesnay, proposed, in, particular, the, liberalization, of, agricultural, markets, which, were, strictly, controlled, to, encourage, greater, production, competition, and, lower, prices, following, the, doctrines, of, quesnay, and, de, gournay, louis, s, controller, of, finances, henri, bertin, created, a, new, society, of, agriculture, and, an, agricultural, committee, within, the, government, comparable, to, those, existing, to, support, commerce, in, may, 1763, bertin, issued, a, decree, permitting, the, tax, free, circulation, of, grain, in, august, 1764, bertin, permitted, the, export, of, grain, from, twenty, seven, french, ports, later, expanded, to, thirty, six, at, the, same, time, he, established, a, large, zone, around, paris, where, grain, was, reserved, exclusively, for, feeding, the, parisians, and, established, a, cap, on, the, grain, price, which, if, it, was, passed, would, cause, the, exports, to, cease, the, policy, of, freeing, grain, prices, was, effective, in, good, years, and, resulted, in, increased, trade, and, lower, prices, but, during, years, with, poor, harvests, 1766, 1767, and, 1768, prices, went, up, most, of, the, parlements, in, regions, which, produced, grain, supported, the, policy, but, others, including, paris, and, rouen, were, highly, critical, in, those, cities, rumors, began, to, circulate, of, a, mythical, starvation, pact, a, supposed, plot, by, the, government, to, deliberately, starve, and, eliminate, the, poor, these, rumors, eventually, became, one, of, the, factors, that, provoked, the, french, revolution, the, duc, de, choiseul, devoted, all, of, his, considerable, energy, and, talents, to, preparing, a, new, war, against, britain, in, 1764, in, a, former, jesuit, school, he, had, closed, he, created, a, new, military, preparatory, school, to, prepare, students, for, the, recently, founded, military, academy, in, 1769, he, raised, the, naval, school, to, the, level, of, a, royal, academy, to, train, officers, for, his, new, fleet, in, the, same, year, he, established, a, military, engineering, school, he, provided, the, army, with, hundreds, of, new, cannon, which, would, be, used, with, great, success, decades, later, during, the, french, revolution, and, by, napoleon, using, the, prussian, army, as, a, model, he, reformed, french, military, doctrine, making, the, state, and, not, the, officers, responsible, for, training, and, equipping, soldiers, a, large, part, of, the, french, navy, had, been, sunk, or, captured, by, the, british, in, the, seven, years, war, in, addition, to, the, existing, naval, arsenals, in, toulon, brest, and, rochefort, he, opened, two, more, in, marseille, 1762, and, lorient, 1764, the, arsenals, began, building, new, ships, by, 1772, the, navy, had, sixty, six, ships, of, the, line, thirty, five, frigates, and, twenty, one, new, corvettes, he, and, his, allies, in, the, government, began, planning, for, an, invasion, of, england, and, his, government, looked, for, new, ways, to, challenge, great, britain, when, the, duc, de, broglie, learned, that, the, british, were, planning, to, tax, the, citizens, of, the, british, colonies, in, america, he, wrote, to, the, king, it, will, be, very, curious, to, know, what, the, result, will, be, and, if, their, execution, doesn, t, result, in, a, revolution, in, those, states, choiseul, combined, his, military, preparations, for, war, with, a, diplomatic, alliance, the, pacte, de, famille, or, pact, of, the, family, which, united, with, other, countries, ruled, by, kings, of, the, bourbon, dynasty, spain, ruled, by, louis, s, cousin, charles, iii, of, spain, the, naples, and, tuscany, choiseul, was, so, entirely, focused, on, great, britain, as, his, future, enemy, that, he, almost, entirely, neglected, the, rest, of, europe, he, had, no, accredited, ambassadors, in, poland, prussia, or, russia, during, most, of, the, period, and, stood, by, while, russia, imposed, its, own, candidate, for, king, of, poland, and, when, turkey, and, russia, went, to, war, in, 1768, 70, a, new, conflict, between, great, britain, and, spain, over, the, remote, falkland, islands, in, 1770, brought, about, choiseul, s, downfall, the, british, had, established, a, settlement, in, the, islands, which, were, also, claimed, by, spain, in, early, 1770, the, spanish, governor, of, buenos, aires, sent, five, warships, full, of, troops, to, the, islands, ordering, the, british, to, leave, the, british, prepared, to, depart, when, the, news, reached, london, the, british, government, demanded, that, the, spanish, leave, both, sides, began, to, prepare, for, war, the, possibility, of, a, new, war, came, just, as, france, was, undergoing, a, new, confrontation, between, the, king, s, government, and, the, parlement, of, rennes, which, once, again, refused, to, recognize, the, power, of, the, king, s, government, to, impose, taxes, the, king, wrote, immediately, to, his, cousin, the, king, of, spain, who, wrote, back, that, spain, did, not, want, a, war, louis, replied, gentleness, and, patience, have, guided, me, to, the, present, but, my, parlements, pushing, to, limit, have, forgotten, themselves, to, the, point, of, disputing, the, sovereign, authority, that, we, possess, only, from, the, will, of, god, i, am, resolved, to, make, myself, obeyed, by, all, available, means, on, 24, december, the, king, sent, a, short, note, to, choiseul, dismissing, him, from, his, post, and, ordering, him, to, return, to, his, home, in, chanteloup, and, to, remain, there, a, similar, note, went, to, his, cousin, choiseul, asked, for, two, days, to, manage, his, affairs, but, the, king, refused, explaining, the, decision, later, to, the, duke, de, broglie, the, king, wrote, the, principles, of, the, choiseuls, are, too, contrary, to, religion, and, therefore, to, royal, authority, the, king, passed, the, leadership, of, the, government, to, a, triumvirate, of, three, conservative, ministers, led, by, his, chancellor, ren, de, maupeou, who, had, been, president, of, the, parlement, from, 1763, to, 1768, maupeou, and, two, other, conservative, ministers, abbot, terray, for, finance, and, the, duc, d, aiguillon, for, foreign, affairs, and, war, took, charge, of, the, government, they, became, known, as, the, triumvirate, the, first, priority, of, maupeou, was, to, bring, the, unruly, parlements, under, control, and, to, continue, with, his, program, for, the, modernization, of, the, state, most, of, the, members, of, the, parlement, of, paris, were, on, a, virtual, strike, refusing, to, render, justice, or, approve, the, king, s, decrees, on, 21, january, 1771, royal, agents, and, musketeers, arrived, at, the, homes, of, each, of, the, parlement, members, informing, them, that, their, positions, were, confiscated, and, ordering, them, to, leave, paris, and, return, to, their, home, provinces, and, not, to, leave, them, this, was, followed, in, february, by, an, even, more, radical, measure, the, regional, parlements, were, replaced, as, the, high, courts, of, civil, justice, by, six, new, regional, high, councils, to, judge, serious, criminal, and, civil, cases, another, decree, announced, the, abolition, of, the, high, fees, demanded, by, the, parlements, for, resolving, civil, cases, which, were, the, source, of, their, members, income, civil, justice, was, to, be, rendered, without, charge, the, powers, of, the, parlement, of, paris, alone, were, largely, unchanged, without, the, provincial, parliaments, the, government, was, able, enact, new, laws, and, taxes, without, opposition, however, after, the, king, s, death, the, nobility, demanded, and, received, the, restoration, of, the, regional, parlements, abbot, terray, was, nominally, a, priest, though, his, government, career, was, entirely, secular, and, his, personal, life, was, considered, scandalous, he, was, an, efficient, and, relentless, tax, collector, he, opened, a, school, to, train, tax, inspectors, and, worked, to, see, that, taxes, were, imposed, and, collected, with, the, same, precision, and, vigor, in, all, regions, without, interference, from, the, local, nobility, when, he, first, took, his, position, the, state, had, a, budget, deficit, of, 60, million, livres, and, a, long, term, debt, of, 100, million, livres, by, 1774, revenues, had, been, increased, by, 60, million, livres, and, the, debt, reduced, to, 20, million, livres, he, also, reimposed, the, regulation, of, the, price, of, grain, which, had, been, freed, in, 1763, and, 1764, these, controls, were, an, issue, which, would, disturb, the, government, and, provoke, agitation, until, the, french, revolution, the, foreign, affairs, post, had, been, left, vacant, by, choiseul, who, acted, as, his, own, foreign, minister, following, the, dismissal, of, choiseul, the, king, encouraged, his, cousin, and, ally, charles, iii, of, spain, to, settle, the, crisis, over, the, falkland, islands, with, the, aim, of, avoiding, a, war, due, to, choiseul, s, sole, focus, on, a, war, with, britain, he, had, completely, ignored, the, rest, of, europe, france, did, not, even, have, an, ambassador, in, vienna, in, 1772, austria, russia, and, prussia, took, territory, from, an, old, french, ally, poland, without, protest, from, france, another, ally, of, france, sweden, also, risked, being, divided, between, russia, and, prussia, upon, the, death, of, its, king, in, 1771, the, prince, royal, gustav, iii, of, sweden, was, staying, in, paris, at, the, time, he, had, a, long, meeting, with, louis, xv, who, promised, to, support, him, with, french, funding, and, assistance, from, louis, s, personal, secret, intelligence, service, the, secret, du, roi, gustave, iii, returned, to, stockholm, on, 19, august, 1772, at, his, command, the, swedish, royal, guard, imprisoned, the, swedish, senate, and, two, days, later, he, was, proclaimed, king, by, the, diet, russia, and, prussia, occupied, with, the, division, of, poland, protested, but, did, not, intervene, in, the, last, years, of, his, reign, the, court, of, versailles, was, a, theater, of, manners, marie, antoinette, a, resident, since, her, marriage, had, difficulty, disguising, her, dislike, for, the, king, s, mistress, madame, du, barry, the, king, constructed, a, set, of, luxurious, rooms, for, madame, du, barry, on, the, floor, above, his, offices, madame, du, barry, also, reigned, in, the, petit, trianon, which, the, king, had, built, for, madame, de, pompadour, and, in, the, pavillon, de, louveciennes, also, built, for, madame, de, pompadour, the, court, was, divided, between, those, who, welcomed, madame, du, barry, and, those, of, the, older, aristocracy, such, as, the, duc, de, choiseul, plus, marie, antoinette, who, scorned, her, the, king, continued, his, grand, construction, projects, including, the, opera, theater, of, the, palace, of, versailles, completed, for, the, celebration, of, the, wedding, of, the, dauphin, and, marie, antoinette, and, the, new, place, louis, xv, now, place, de, la, concorde, in, paris, whose, centerpiece, was, an, equestrian, statue, of, the, king, modeled, after, that, of, louis, xiv, on, the, place, vend, me, on, 26, april, 1774, the, king, left, for, the, petit, trianon, with, madame, du, barry, and, several, nobles, from, his, entourage, and, reported, that, he, felt, ill, he, participated, in, the, hunt, the, next, day, but, rode, in, his, carriage, instead, of, on, horseback, that, evening, he, was, still, feeling, ill, and, sent, for, the, court, physician, le, marini, re, at, the, surgeon, s, insistence, the, king, was, brought, back, to, the, palace, of, versailles, for, treatment, along, with, madame, du, barry, and, the, others, the, king, was, attended, by, six, physicians, six, surgeons, each, of, whom, took, his, pulse, and, gave, his, diagnosis, he, was, bled, three, times, by, the, surgeons, without, effect, when, some, red, eruptions, appeared, on, his, skin, the, doctors, first, diagnosed, petite, variole, or, smallpox, which, caused, optimism, since, the, patient, and, doctors, both, believed, he, had, already, had, the, illness, the, members, of, the, family, particularly, the, dauphin, and, marie, antoinette, were, asked, to, leave, since, they, had, not, already, had, the, illness, and, had, no, immunity, madame, du, barry, remained, with, him, as, the, hours, passed, the, red, eruptions, of, the, disease, grew, worse, and, the, doctors, began, to, fear, for, his, life, on, the, morning, of, 1, may, the, archbishop, of, paris, arrived, but, was, kept, out, of, the, king, s, room, to, avoid, alarming, him, the, king, remained, conscious, and, cheerful, however, on, 3, may, he, studied, the, eruptions, on, his, hands, summoned, the, archbishop, and, announced, i, have, the, petite, variole, the, archbishop, instructed, him, to, prepare, for, the, final, rites, that, night, the, king, summoned, madame, du, barry, informed, her, of, the, diagnosis, and, said, we, cannot, recommence, the, scandal, of, metz, if, i, had, known, what, i, know, now, you, would, not, have, been, admitted, i, owe, it, to, god, and, to, my, people, therefore, you, have, to, leave, tomorrow, on, 7, may, he, summoned, his, confessor, and, was, given, the, final, rites, the, illness, continued, its, course, one, visitor, on, 9, may, the, duc, de, croy, said, the, king, s, face, resembled, with, the, darkening, of, the, eruptions, of, the, smallpox, a, mask, of, bronze, louis, died, at, 3, 15, in, the, morning, on, 10, may, 1774, with, his, daughters, ad, la, de, victoire, sophie, and, louise, at, his, bedside, several, of, his, contemporaries, who, worked, closely, with, him, tried, to, describe, the, personality, of, louis, xv, the, duke, de, croy, wrote, he, had, a, memory, presence, and, justness, of, spirit, that, was, unique, he, was, gentle, an, excellent, father, and, the, most, honest, individual, in, the, world, he, was, well, informed, in, the, sciences, but, with, a, modesty, which, with, him, was, almost, a, vice, he, always, saw, more, correctly, than, others, but, he, always, believed, he, was, wrong, he, had, the, greatest, bravery, but, a, bravery, that, was, too, modest, he, never, dared, to, decide, for, himself, but, always, out, of, modesty, turned, for, advice, to, others, even, when, he, saw, more, accurately, than, they, did, louis, xiv, had, been, too, proud, but, louis, xv, was, not, proud, enough, other, than, his, excessive, modesty, his, great, and, sole, vice, was, women, he, believed, that, only, his, mistresses, loved, him, enough, to, tell, him, the, truth, for, that, reason, he, allowed, them, to, lead, him, which, contributed, to, his, failure, with, finance, which, was, the, worse, aspect, of, his, reign, others, like, d, argenson, his, minister, of, war, commented, on, his, extreme, shyness, and, timidity, his, inability, to, make, conversation, with, others, the, duke, of, luynes, remarked, that, he, often, seemed, to, want, to, speak, but, his, timidity, stopped, him, and, the, expressions, did, not, come, one, felt, that, he, wanted, to, say, something, obliging, but, he, often, ended, by, simply, asking, a, frivolous, question, another, characteristic, remarked, by, contemporaries, was, his, penchant, for, secrecy, no, one, was, a, greater, expert, at, dissimulation, than, the, king, wrote, d, argenson, he, worked, from, morning, to, night, to, dissimulate, he, did, not, say, a, word, make, a, gesture, or, demarche, except, to, hide, what, he, really, wanted, he, was, the, most, excellent, of, men, wrote, another, contemporary, duffort, de, cheverny, but, in, defiance, of, himself, he, spoke, about, the, affairs, of, state, as, if, someone, else, was, governing, the, most, famous, remark, attributed, to, louis, xv, or, sometimes, to, madame, de, pompadour, is, apr, s, nous, le, d, luge, after, us, the, deluge, it, is, commonly, explained, as, his, indifference, to, financial, excesses, and, a, prediction, of, the, french, revolution, to, come, the, remark, is, usually, taken, out, of, its, original, context, it, was, made, in, 1757, a, year, which, saw, the, crushing, defeat, of, the, french, army, by, the, prussians, at, the, battle, of, rossbach, and, the, assassination, attempt, on, the, king, the, deluge, the, king, referred, to, was, not, a, revolution, but, the, arrival, of, halley, s, comet, which, was, predicted, to, pass, by, the, earth, in, 1757, and, which, was, commonly, blamed, for, having, caused, the, flood, described, in, the, bible, with, predictions, of, a, new, deluge, when, it, returned, the, king, was, a, proficient, amateur, astronomer, who, collaborated, with, the, best, french, astronomers, biographer, michel, antoine, wrote, that, the, king, s, remark, was, a, manner, of, evoking, with, his, scientific, culture, and, a, good, dose, of, black, humor, this, sinister, year, beginning, with, the, assassination, attempt, by, damiens, and, ending, with, the, prussian, victory, halley, s, comet, finally, passed, the, earth, in, april, 1759, and, attracted, enormous, public, attention, and, anxiety, but, caused, no, floods, another, popular, legend, concerned, the, maison, aux, cerfs, the, house, in, versailles, where, when, he, was, no, longer, having, sexual, relations, with, madame, de, pompadour, he, sometimes, slept, with, his, petites, maitresses, young, women, recruited, for, that, purpose, popular, legends, at, the, time, described, it, as, a, kind, of, harem, organized, by, madame, de, pompadour, where, a, group, of, women, were, kidnapped, and, kept, for, the, king, s, pleasure, the, legend, circulated, widely, in, pamphlets, with, lurid, illustrations, and, made, its, way, into, some, later, biographies, of, the, king, in, reality, it, had, only, one, occupant, at, a, time, for, brief, periods, madame, de, pompadour, herself, accepted, it, as, a, preferable, alternative, to, a, rival, at, court, as, she, stated, it, is, his, heart, i, want, all, these, little, girls, with, no, education, will, not, take, it, from, me, i, would, not, be, so, calm, if, i, saw, some, pretty, woman, of, the, court, or, the, capital, trying, to, conquer, it, in, february, 1765, after, the, death, of, madame, de, pompadour, it, was, closed, louis, was, a, major, patron, of, architecture, he, spent, more, money, on, buildings, over, the, course, of, his, reign, than, louis, xiv, his, major, architectural, projects, were, the, work, of, his, favorite, court, architect, ange, jacques, gabriel, they, included, the, ecole, militaire, 1751, 1770, the, place, louis, xv, now, place, de, la, concorde, 1763, 83, the, petit, trianon, at, versailles, 1762, 64, and, the, opera, theater, of, the, palace, of, versailles, louis, began,

tried, to, share, the, power, of, the, sovereign, however, the, king, s, lack, of, further, reforms, in, his, last, years, disappointed, voltaire, when, the, king, died, voltaire, wrote, of, his, reign, fifty, six, years, consumed, with, fatigues, and, wanderings, e, h, gombrich, writes, louis, xv, and, louis, xvi, the, sun, king, s, successors, were, incompetent, and, content, merely, to,

scale, the, peasants, worked, till, they, dropped, and, citizens, were, forced, to, pay, huge, taxes, louis, was, blamed, for, significant, diplomatic, military, and, economic, reverses, his, reign, was, marked, by, ministerial, instability, while, his, prestige, was, ruined, by, military, failure, and, colonial, losses, despite, louis, failings, in, administration, and, war, many, historians, agree, that, france, reached, a, high, point, of, culture, and, art, under, his, reign, louis, inherited, a, french, monarchy, at, the, zenith, of, its, cultural, influence, and, political, power, a, position, it, kept, during, the, first, half, of, the, eighteenth, century, however, most, scholars, agree, that, louis, xv, s, decisions, weakened, france, depleted, the, treasury, discredited, the, absolute, monarchy, and, unsettled, the, trust, and, respect, of, the, french, and, foreigners, alike, scholars, point, to, the, french, revolution, which, broke, out, 15, years, after, his, death, norman, davies, characterizes, louis, xv, s, reign, as, one, of, debilitating, stagnation, characterized, by, a, costly, defeat, in, the, seven, years, war, endless, clashes, between, the, court, and, the, parlements, and, religious, feuds, jerome, blum, described, the, king, as, a, perpetual, adolescent, called, to, do, a, man, s, job, the, view, of, many, historians, is, that, louis, was, unequal, to, the, high, expectations, of, his, subjects, robert, harris, writes, that, historians, have, depicted, this, ruler, as, one, of, the, weakest, of, the, bourbons, a, do, nothing, king, who, left, affairs, of, state, to, ministers, while, indulging, in, his, hobbies, of, hunting, and, womanizing, ministers, rose, and, fell, according, to, his, mistresses, opinions, seriously, undermining, the, confidence, in, the, monarchy, for, much, of, his, lifetime, louis, xv, was, celebrated, as, a, national, hero, edm, bouchardon, s, equestrian, statue, of, louis, was, originally, conceived, to, commemorate, the, monarch, s, victorious, role, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, portrayed, the, king, as, peacemaker, fifteen, years, later, in, 1763, following, france, s, defeat, in, the, seven, years, war, it, was, unveiled, in, a, patriotic, spectacle, staged, to, restore, public, confidence, in, a, monarchy, in, decline, located, on, the, place, louis, xv, the, statue, was, torn, down, during, the, revolution, some, scholars, have, turned, away, from, the, king, s, own, actions, to, his, image, in, the, mind, of, the, public, emmanuel, le, roy, ladurie, the, leader, of, the, annales, school, noted, that, the, king, was, handsome, athletic, intelligent, and, an, excellent, hunter, but, that, he, disappointed, the, people, however, he, did, not, keep, up, the, practice, of, attending, mass, and, the, people, felt, he, had, shirked, his, religious, obligations, and, diminished, the, sacred, nature, of, the, monarchy, according, to, kenneth, n, jassie, and, jeffrey, merrick, contemporary, songs, poems, and, public, declarations, typically, portrayed, a, king, as, a, master, an, unblemished, christian, and, a, benevolent, provider, baker, young, louis, failings, were, attributed, to, inexperience, and, manipulation, by, his, advisors, jassie, and, merrick, argue, that, the, king, s, troubles, mounted, steadily, and, the, people, blamed, and, ridiculed, his, debauchery, the, king, was, a, notorious, womaniser, the, monarch, s, virility, was, supposed, to, reflect, his, power, nevertheless, popular, faith, in, the, monarchy, was, shaken, by, the, scandals, of, louis, private, life, and, by, the, end, of, his, life, he, had, become, despised, the, king, ignored, the, famines, and, crises, of, the, nation, until, the, people, reviled, him, in, protest, and, finally, celebrated, his, death, the, monarchy, survived, for, a, while, but, louis, xv, left, his, successor, with, a, smoldering, legacy, of, popular, resentment, some, sermons, on, his, death, in, 1774, praised, the, monarch, and, went, out, of, their, way, to, excuse, his, faults, jeffrey, merrick, writes, but, those, ecclesiastics, who, not, only, raised, their, eyebrows, over, the, sins, of, the, beloved, but, also, expressed, doubts, about, his, policies, reflected, the, corporate, attitude, of, the, first, estate, more, accurately, they, prayed, the, new, king, would, restore, morality, at, court, and, better, serve, the, will, of, god, the, financial, strain, imposed, by, the, wars, and, excesses, of, the, royal, court, and, the, consequent, dissatisfaction, with, the, monarchy, contributed, to, the, national, unrest, that, culminated, in, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, the, historian, colin, jones, argues, that, louis, xv, left, france, with, serious, financial, difficulties, the, military, disasters, of, the, seven, years, war, led, to, acute, state, financial, crisis, ultimately, louis, xv, failed, to, overcome, these, fiscal, problems, mainly, because, he, was, incapable, of, resolving, conflicts, among, the, parties, and, interests, in, his, entourage, although, aware, of, the, forces, of, anti, monarchism, threatening, his, family, s, rule, he, did, not, act, effectively, to, stop, them, trends, in, 20th, century, french, historiography, especially, the, annales, school, have, deprecated, biography, and, minimized, the, role, of, the, king, english, historian, william, doyle, wrote, the, political, story, of, the, reigns, of, louis, xv, and, louis, xvi, by, contrast, had, too, often, been, scorned, and, therefore, neglected, as, a, meaningless, succession, of, petty, intrigues, in, boudoirs, and, bedrooms, unworthy, of, serious, attention, when, there, were, economic, cycles, demographic, fluctuations, rising, and, falling, classes, and, deep, seated, shifts, in, cultural, values, to, analyse, a, few, scholars, have, defended, louis, arguing, that, his, highly, negative, reputation, was, based, on, propaganda, meant, to, justify, the, french, revolution, olivier, bernier, argued, that, louis, le, bien, aim, the, well, beloved, was, a, popular, leader, who, reformed, france, during, his, 59, year, reign, france, was, never, threatened, by, foreign, conquest, though, some, of, its, overseas, colonies, were, lost, many, of, his, subjects, prayed, for, his, recovery, during, his, serious, illness, in, metz, in, 1744, his, dismissal, of, the, parlement, of, paris, and, his, chief, minister, choiseul, in, 1771, were, attempts, to, wrest, control, of, government, from, those, louis, considered, corrupt, he, changed, the, tax, code, to, try, to, balance, the, national, budget, bernier, argued, that, these, acts, would, have, avoided, the, french, revolution, if, his, successor, louis, xvi, had, not, reversed, them, guy, chaussinand, nogaret, claims, that, louis, xv, s, tarnished, reputation, was, created, fifteen, years, after, his, death, to, justify, the, revolution, and, that, the, nobility, during, his, reign, were, competent, louis, xv, had, several, illegitimate, children, although, the, exact, number, is, unknown, historiography, suggest, the, following, as, possible, issue, of, the, king
