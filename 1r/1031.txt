nebuchadnezzar, ii, n, b, j, k, d, n, z, r, babylonian, cuneiform, nab, kudurri, u, ur, meaning, nabu, watch, over, my, heir, biblical, hebrew, n, a, ne, ar, also, spelled, nebuchadrezzar, ii, was, the, second, king, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, ruling, from, the, death, of, his, father, nabopolassar, in, 605, bc, to, his, own, death, in, 562, bc, historically, known, as, nebuchadnezzar, the, great, he, is, typically, regarded, as, the, empire, s, greatest, king, nebuchadnezzar, remains, famous, for, his, military, campaigns, in, the, levant, for, his, construction, projects, in, his, capital, babylon, including, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, and, for, the, role, he, plays, in, jewish, history, ruling, for, 43, years, nebuchadnezzar, was, the, longest, reigning, king, of, the, babylonian, dynasty, by, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, among, the, most, powerful, rulers, in, the, world, possibly, named, after, his, grandfather, of, the, same, name, or, after, nebuchadnezzar, i, r, c, 1125, 1104, bc, one, of, babylon, s, greatest, ancient, warrior, kings, nebuchadnezzar, ii, already, secured, renown, for, himself, during, his, father, s, reign, leading, armies, in, the, medo, babylonian, conquest, of, the, assyrian, empire, at, the, battle, of, carchemish, in, 605, bc, nebuchadnezzar, inflicted, a, crushing, defeat, on, an, egyptian, army, led, by, pharaoh, necho, ii, and, ensured, that, the, neo, babylonian, empire, would, succeed, the, neo, assyrian, empire, as, the, dominant, power, in, the, ancient, near, east, shortly, after, this, victory, nabopolassar, died, and, nebuchadnezzar, became, king, despite, his, successful, military, career, during, his, father, s, reign, the, first, third, or, so, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, saw, little, to, no, major, military, achievements, and, notably, a, disastrous, failure, in, an, attempted, invasion, of, egypt, these, years, of, lackluster, military, performance, saw, some, of, babylon, s, vassals, particularly, in, the, levant, beginning, to, doubt, babylon, s, power, viewing, the, neo, babylonian, empire, as, a, paper, tiger, rather, than, a, power, truly, on, the, level, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, the, situation, grew, so, severe, that, people, in, babylonia, itself, began, disobeying, the, king, some, going, as, far, as, to, revolt, against, nebuchadnezzar, s, rule, after, this, disappointing, early, period, as, king, nebuchadnezzar, s, luck, turned, in, the, 580s, bc, nebuchadnezzar, engaged, in, a, successful, string, of, military, actions, in, the, levant, against, the, vassal, states, in, rebellion, there, likely, with, the, ultimate, intent, of, curbing, egyptian, influence, in, the, region, in, 587, bc, nebuchadnezzar, destroyed, the, kingdom, of, judah, and, its, capital, jerusalem, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, led, to, the, babylonian, captivity, as, the, city, s, population, and, people, from, the, surrounding, lands, were, deported, to, babylonia, the, jews, thereafter, referred, to, nebuchadnezzar, the, greatest, enemy, they, had, faced, until, that, point, as, a, destroyer, of, nations, jer, 4, 7, the, biblical, book, of, jeremiah, paints, nebuchadnezzar, as, a, cruel, enemy, but, also, as, god, s, appointed, ruler, of, the, world, and, a, divine, instrument, to, punish, disobedience, through, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, the, capture, of, the, rebellious, phoenician, city, of, tyre, and, other, campaigns, in, the, levant, nebuchadnezzar, completed, the, neo, babylonian, empire, s, transformation, into, the, new, great, power, of, the, ancient, near, east, in, addition, to, his, military, campaigns, nebuchadnezzar, is, remembered, as, a, great, builder, king, the, prosperity, ensured, by, his, wars, allowed, nebuchadnezzar, to, conduct, great, building, projects, in, babylon, and, elsewhere, in, mesopotamia, the, modern, image, of, babylon, is, largely, of, the, city, as, it, was, after, nebuchadnezzar, s, projects, during, which, he, among, other, work, rebuilt, many, of, the, city, s, religious, buildings, including, the, esagila, and, etemenanki, renovated, its, existing, palace, constructed, a, brand, new, palace, and, beautified, its, ceremonial, centre, through, renovations, to, the, city, s, processional, street, and, the, ishtar, gate, as, most, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, inscriptions, deal, with, his, building, projects, rather, than, military, accomplishments, he, was, for, a, time, seen, by, historians, mostly, as, a, builder, rather, than, a, warrior, there, are, very, few, cuneiform, sources, for, the, period, between, 594, bc, and, 557, bc, covering, much, of, the, reign, of, nebuchadnezzar, ii, and, the, reigns, of, his, three, immediate, successors, amel, marduk, neriglissar, and, labashi, marduk, this, lack, of, sources, has, the, unfortunate, effect, that, even, though, nebuchadnezzar, had, the, longest, reign, of, all, of, them, less, is, confidently, known, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, than, of, the, reigns, of, almost, all, the, other, neo, babylonian, kings, though, the, handful, of, cuneiform, sources, recovered, notably, the, babylonian, chronicle, confirm, some, events, of, his, reign, such, as, conflicts, with, the, kingdom, of, judah, other, events, such, as, the, 586, bc, destruction, of, solomon, s, temple, and, other, military, campaigns, nebuchadnezzar, possibly, conducted, are, not, covered, in, any, known, cuneiform, documents, as, a, result, historical, reconstructions, of, this, period, generally, follow, secondary, sources, in, hebrew, greek, and, latin, to, determine, what, events, transpired, at, the, time, in, addition, to, contract, tablets, from, babylonia, though, use, of, the, sources, written, by, later, authors, many, of, them, created, several, centuries, after, nebuchadnezzar, s, time, and, often, reflecting, their, own, cultural, attitudes, to, the, events, and, figures, discussed, presents, problems, in, and, of, itself, blurring, the, line, between, history, and, tradition, it, is, the, only, possible, approach, to, gain, insight, into, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, nebuchadnezzar, ii, s, name, in, akkadian, was, nab, kudurri, u, ur, meaning, nabu, watch, over, my, heir, the, name, was, often, interpreted, in, earlier, scholarship, as, nabu, protect, the, boundary, given, that, the, word, kudurru, can, also, mean, boundary, or, line, modern, historians, support, the, heir, interpretation, over, the, boundary, interpretation, in, terms, of, this, name, there, is, no, reason, to, believe, that, the, babylonians, intended, the, name, to, be, difficult, to, interpret, or, to, have, a, double, meaning, nab, kudurri, u, ur, is, typically, anglicised, to, nebuchadnezzar, following, how, the, name, is, most, commonly, rendered, in, hebrew, and, greek, particularly, in, most, of, the, bible, in, hebrew, the, name, was, rendered, as, n, a, ne, ar, and, in, greek, it, was, rendered, as, nabouchodonosor, some, scholars, such, as, donald, wiseman, prefer, the, anglicisation, nebuchadrezzar, with, an, r, rather, than, an, n, following, the, assumption, that, nebuchadnezzar, is, a, later, corrupted, form, of, the, contemporary, nab, kudurri, u, ur, the, alternate, anglicisation, nebuchadrezzar, derives, from, how, the, name, is, rendered, in, the, books, of, jeremiah, and, ezekiel, n, a, re, ar, a, more, faithful, transliteration, of, the, original, akkadian, name, the, assyriologist, adrianus, van, selms, suggested, in, 1974, that, the, variant, with, an, n, rather, than, an, r, was, a, rude, nickname, deriving, from, an, akkadian, rendition, like, nab, k, danu, u, ur, which, means, nabu, protect, the, mule, though, there, is, no, concrete, evidence, for, this, idea, van, selms, believed, that, a, nickname, like, that, could, derive, from, nebuchadnezzar, s, early, reign, which, was, plagued, by, political, instability, nebuchadnezzar, ii, s, name, nab, kudurri, u, ur, was, identical, to, the, name, of, his, distant, predecessor, nebuchadnezzar, i, r, c, 1125, 1104, bc, who, ruled, more, than, five, centuries, before, nebuchadnezzar, ii, s, time, like, nebuchadnezzar, ii, nebuchadnezzar, i, was, a, renowned, warrior, king, who, appeared, in, a, time, of, political, upheaval, and, defeated, the, forces, of, babylon, s, enemies, in, nebuchadnezzar, i, s, case, the, elamites, although, theophoric, names, using, the, god, nabu, are, common, in, texts, from, the, early, neo, babylonian, empire, the, name, nebuchadnezzar, is, relatively, rare, only, being, mentioned, four, times, with, certainty, though, there, is, no, evidence, that, nabopolassar, named, his, son, after, nebuchadnezzar, i, nabopolassar, was, knowledgeable, in, history, and, actively, worked, to, connect, his, rule, to, the, rule, of, the, akkadian, empire, which, preceded, him, by, nearly, two, thousand, years, the, significance, of, his, son, and, heir, bearing, the, name, of, one, of, babylon, s, greatest, kings, would, not, have, been, lost, on, nabopolassar, if, jursa, s, theory, concerning, nabopolassar, s, origin, is, correct, it, is, alternatively, possible, that, nebuchadnezzar, ii, was, named, after, his, grandfather, of, the, same, name, as, the, babylonians, employed, patronymics, rather, than, after, the, previous, king, nebuchadnezzar, was, the, eldest, son, of, nabopolassar, r, 626, 605, bc, the, founder, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, this, is, confirmed, by, nabopolassar, s, inscriptions, which, explicitly, name, nebuchadnezzar, as, his, eldest, son, as, well, as, inscriptions, from, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, which, refer, to, him, as, the, first, or, chief, son, of, nabopolassar, and, as, nabopolassar, s, true, or, legitimate, heir, the, neo, babylonian, empire, was, founded, through, nabopolassar, s, rebellion, and, later, war, against, the, neo, assyrian, empire, which, liberated, babylonia, after, nearly, a, century, of, assyrian, control, the, war, resulted, in, the, complete, destruction, of, assyria, and, the, neo, babylonian, empire, which, rose, in, its, place, was, powerful, but, hastily, built, and, politically, unstable, as, nabopolassar, never, clarified, his, ancestry, in, lineage, in, any, of, his, inscriptions, his, origin, is, not, entirely, clear, subsequent, historians, have, variously, identified, nabopolassar, as, a, chaldean, an, assyrian, or, a, babylonian, although, no, evidence, conclusively, confirms, him, as, being, of, chaldean, origin, the, term, chaldean, dynasty, is, frequently, used, by, modern, historians, for, the, royal, family, he, founded, and, the, term, chaldean, empire, remains, in, use, as, an, alternate, historiographical, name, for, the, neo, babylonian, empire, nabopolassar, appears, to, regardless, of, his, ethnic, origin, have, been, strongly, connected, to, the, city, of, uruk, located, south, of, babylon, it, is, possible, that, he, was, a, member, of, its, ruling, elite, before, becoming, king, and, there, is, a, growing, body, of, evidence, that, nabopolassar, s, family, originated, in, uruk, for, instance, that, nebuchadnezzar, s, daughters, lived, in, the, city, in, 2007, michael, jursa, advanced, the, theory, that, nabopolassar, was, a, member, of, a, prominent, political, family, in, uruk, whose, members, are, attested, since, the, reign, of, esarhaddon, r, 681, 669, bc, to, support, his, theory, jursa, pointed, to, how, documents, describe, how, the, grave, and, body, of, kudurru, a, deceased, governor, of, uruk, was, desecrated, due, to, the, anti, assyrian, activities, of, kudurru, s, two, sons, nabu, shumu, ukin, and, a, son, whose, name, is, mostly, missing, the, desecration, went, so, far, as, to, drag, kudurru, s, body, through, the, streets, of, uruk, kudurru, can, be, identified, with, nebuchadnezzar, nab, kudurri, u, ur, kudurru, simply, being, a, common, and, shortened, nickname, a, prominent, official, in, uruk, who, served, as, its, governor, under, the, assyrian, king, ashurbanipal, r, 669, 631, bc, in, the, 640s, bc, in, assyrian, tradition, the, desecration, of, a, dead, body, showed, that, the, deceased, individual, and, their, surviving, family, were, traitors, and, enemies, of, the, state, and, that, they, had, to, be, completely, eradicated, serving, to, punish, them, even, after, death, the, name, of, the, son, whose, name, is, unpreserved, in, the, letter, ended, with, either, ahi, n, sir, or, u, ur, and, the, remaining, traces, can, fit, with, the, name, nab, apla, u, ur, meaning, that, nabopolassar, could, be, the, other, son, mentioned, in, the, letter, and, thus, a, son, of, kudurru, strengthening, this, connection, is, that, nebuchadnezzar, ii, is, attested, very, early, during, his, father, s, reign, from, 626, 625, to, 617, bc, as, high, priest, of, the, eanna, temple, in, uruk, where, he, is, often, attested, under, the, nickname, kudurru, nebuchadnezzar, must, have, been, made, high, priest, at, a, very, young, age, considering, that, his, year, of, death, 562, bc, is, 64, years, after, 626, bc, the, original, kudurru, s, second, son, nabu, shumu, ukin, also, appears, to, be, attested, as, a, prominent, general, under, nabopolassar, and, the, name, was, also, used, by, nebuchadnezzar, ii, for, one, of, his, sons, possibly, honoring, his, dead, uncle, nebuchadnezzar, s, military, career, began, in, the, reign, of, his, father, though, little, information, survives, based, on, a, letter, sent, to, the, temple, administration, of, the, eanna, temple, it, appears, that, nebuchadnezzar, participated, in, his, father, s, campaign, to, take, the, city, of, harran, in, 610, bc, harran, was, the, seat, of, ashur, uballit, ii, who, had, rallied, what, remained, of, the, assyrian, army, and, ruled, the, neo, assyrian, rump, state, the, babylonian, victory, in, the, harran, campaign, and, the, defeat, of, ashur, uballit, in, 609, bce, marked, the, end, of, the, ancient, assyrian, monarchy, which, would, never, be, restored, according, to, the, babylonian, chronicles, nebuchadnezzar, also, commanded, an, army, in, an, unspecified, mountainous, region, for, several, months, in, 607, bc, in, the, war, against, the, babylonians, and, medes, assyria, had, allied, with, pharaoh, psamtik, i, of, the, twenty, sixth, dynasty, of, egypt, who, had, been, interested, in, ensuring, assyria, s, survival, so, that, assyria, could, remain, as, a, buffer, state, between, his, own, kingdom, and, the, babylonian, and, median, kingdoms, after, the, fall, of, harran, psamtik, s, successor, pharaoh, necho, ii, personally, led, a, large, army, into, former, assyrian, lands, to, turn, the, tide, of, the, war, and, restore, the, neo, assyrian, empire, even, though, it, was, more, or, less, a, lost, cause, as, assyria, had, already, collapsed, as, nabopolassar, was, occupied, with, fighting, urartu, in, the, north, the, egyptians, took, control, of, the, levant, largely, unopposed, capturing, territories, as, far, north, as, the, city, of, carchemish, in, syria, where, necho, established, his, base, of, operations, nebuchadnezzar, s, greatest, victory, from, his, time, as, crown, prince, came, at, the, battle, of, carchemish, in, 605, bc, which, put, an, end, to, necho, s, campaign, in, the, levant, by, inflicting, a, crushing, defeat, on, the, egyptians, nebuchadnezzar, had, been, the, sole, commander, of, the, babylonian, army, at, this, battle, as, his, father, had, chosen, to, stay, in, babylon, perhaps, on, account, of, illness, necho, s, forces, were, completely, annihilated, by, nebuchadnezzar, s, army, with, babylonian, sources, claiming, that, not, a, single, egyptian, escaped, alive, the, account, of, the, battle, in, the, babylonian, chronicle, reads, as, follows, the, king, of, akkad, stayed, home, while, nebuchadnezzar, his, eldest, son, and, crown, prince, mustered, he, took, his, army, s, lead, and, marched, to, carchemish, which, is, on, the, bank, of, the, euphrates, he, crossed, the, river, at, carchemish, they, did, battle, together, the, army, of, egypt, retreated, before, him, he, inflicted, a, upon, them, and, finished, them, off, completely, in, the, district, of, hamath, the, army, of, akkad, overtook, the, remainder, of, the, army, of, managed, to, escape, the, defeat, and, which, was, not, overcome, they, inflicted, a, defeat, upon, them, so, that, a, single, egyptian, man, home, at, that, time, nebuchadnezzar, conquered, all, of, ha, th, the, story, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, victory, at, carchemish, reverberated, through, history, appearing, in, many, later, ancient, accounts, including, in, the, book, of, jeremiah, and, the, books, of, kings, in, the, bible, it, is, possible, to, conclude, based, on, subsequent, geopolitics, that, the, victory, resulted, in, all, of, syria, and, israel, coming, under, the, control, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, a, feat, which, the, assyrians, under, tiglath, pileser, iii, r, 745, 727, bc, only, accomplished, after, five, years, of, protracted, military, campaigns, the, defeat, of, egypt, at, carchemish, ensured, that, the, neo, babylonian, empire, would, grow, to, become, the, major, power, of, the, ancient, near, east, and, the, uncontested, successor, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, nabopolassar, died, just, a, few, weeks, after, nebuchadnezzar, s, victory, at, carchemish, at, this, point, in, time, nebuchadnezzar, was, still, away, on, his, campaign, against, the, egyptians, having, chased, the, retreating, egyptian, forces, to, the, region, around, the, city, of, hamath, the, news, of, nabopolassar, s, death, reached, nebuchadnezzar, s, camp, on, 8, abu, late, july, and, nebuchadnezzar, quickly, arranged, affairs, with, the, egyptians, and, rushed, back, to, babylon, where, he, was, proclaimed, king, on, 1, ul, lu, mid, august, the, speed, in, which, nebuchadnezzar, returned, to, babylon, might, be, due, to, the, threat, that, one, of, his, brothers, two, are, known, by, name, nabu, shum, lishir, and, nabu, zer, ushabshi, could, claim, the, throne, in, his, absence, though, nebuchadnezzar, had, been, recognised, as, the, eldest, son, and, heir, by, nabopolassar, nabu, shum, lishir, nabopolassar, s, second, born, son, had, been, recognised, as, his, equal, brother, a, dangerously, vague, title, despite, these, possible, fears, there, were, no, attempts, made, at, usurping, his, throne, at, this, time, one, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, first, acts, as, king, was, to, bury, his, father, nabopolassar, was, laid, in, a, huge, coffin, adorned, with, ornamented, gold, plates, and, fine, dresses, with, golden, beads, which, was, then, placed, within, a, small, palace, he, had, constructed, in, babylon, shortly, thereafter, before, the, end, of, the, month, in, which, he, had, been, crowned, nebuchadnezzar, returned, to, syria, to, resume, his, campaign, the, babylonian, chronicle, records, that, he, marched, about, victoriously, meaning, that, he, faced, little, to, no, resistance, returning, to, babylon, after, several, months, of, campaigning, the, syrian, campaign, though, it, resulted, in, a, certain, amount, of, plunder, was, not, a, complete, success, in, that, it, did, not, ensure, nebuchadnezzar, s, grasp, on, the, region, he, had, seemingly, failed, to, inspire, fear, given, that, none, of, the, westernmost, states, in, the, levant, swore, fealty, to, him, and, paid, tribute, though, little, information, survives, concerning, them, the, babylonian, chronicle, preserves, brief, accounts, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, military, activities, in, his, first, eleven, years, as, king, in, 604, bc, nebuchadnezzar, campaigned, in, the, levant, once, again, conquering, the, city, of, ascalon, according, to, the, babylonian, chronicle, ascalon, s, king, was, captured, and, taken, to, babylon, and, the, city, was, plundered, and, levelled, to, the, ground, modern, excavations, at, ascalon, have, confirmed, that, the, city, was, more, or, less, destroyed, at, this, point, in, time, the, ascalon, campaign, was, preceded, by, a, campaign, in, syria, which, was, more, successful, than, nebuchadnezzar, s, first, resulting, in, oaths, of, fealty, from, the, rulers, of, phoenicia, in, 603, bc, nebuchadnezzar, campaigned, in, a, land, whose, name, is, not, preserved, in, the, surviving, copy, of, the, chronicle, the, chronicle, records, that, this, campaign, was, extensive, given, that, the, account, mentions, the, construction, of, large, siege, towers, and, a, siege, of, a, city, the, name, of, which, does, not, survive, either, anson, rainey, speculated, in, 1975, that, the, city, taken, was, gaza, whereas, nadav, na, aman, thought, in, 1992, that, it, was, kummuh, in, south, eastern, anatolia, in, the, second, half, of, the, 5th, century, bc, some, documents, mentioned, the, towns, isqalanu, the, name, derived, from, ascalon, and, hazzatu, the, name, possibly, derived, from, gaza, near, the, city, of, nippur, indicating, that, deportees, from, both, of, these, cities, lived, near, nippur, and, as, such, possibly, that, they, had, been, captured, at, around, the, same, time, in, both, 602, bc, and, 601, bc, nebuchadnezzar, campaigned, in, the, levant, though, little, information, survives, beyond, that, a, vast, amount, of, booty, was, brought, from, the, levant, to, babylonia, in, 602, bc, on, account, of, the, entry, for, 602, bc, also, referring, to, nabu, shum, lishir, nebuchadnezzar, s, younger, brother, in, a, fragmentary, and, unclear, context, it, is, possible, that, nabu, shum, lishir, led, a, revolt, against, his, brother, in, an, attempt, to, usurp, the, throne, in, that, year, especially, since, he, is, no, longer, mentioned, in, any, sources, after, 602, bc, the, damage, to, the, text, however, makes, this, idea, speculative, and, conjectural, in, the, 601, bc, campaign, nebuchadnezzar, departed, from, the, levant, and, then, marched, into, egypt, despite, the, defeat, at, carchemish, in, 605, bc, egypt, still, had, a, great, amount, of, influence, in, the, levant, even, though, the, region, was, ostensibly, under, babylonian, rule, thus, a, campaign, against, egypt, was, logical, in, order, to, assert, babylonian, dominance, and, also, carried, enormous, economic, and, propagandistic, benefits, but, it, was, also, risky, and, ambitious, the, path, into, egypt, was, difficult, and, the, lack, of, secure, control, of, either, side, of, the, sinai, desert, could, spell, disaster, nebuchadnezzar, s, invasion, of, egypt, failed, the, babylonian, chronicle, states, that, both, the, egyptian, and, babylonian, armies, suffered, a, huge, number, of, casualties, though, egypt, was, not, conquered, the, campaign, did, result, in, momentarily, curbing, egyptian, interest, in, the, levant, given, that, necho, ii, gave, up, his, ambitions, in, the, region, in, 599, bc, nebuchadnezzar, marched, his, army, into, the, levant, and, then, attacked, and, raided, the, arabs, in, the, syrian, desert, though, apparently, successful, it, is, unclear, what, the, achievements, gained, in, this, campaign, were, in, 598, bc, nebuchadnezzar, campaigned, against, the, kingdom, of, judah, succeeding, in, capturing, the, city, of, jerusalem, judah, represented, a, prime, target, of, babylonian, attention, given, that, it, was, at, the, epicenter, of, competition, between, babylon, and, egypt, by, 601, bc, judah, s, king, jehoiakim, had, begun, to, openly, challenge, babylonian, authority, counting, on, that, egypt, would, lend, support, to, his, cause, nebuchadnezzar, s, first, 598, 597, bc, assault, on, jerusalem, is, recorded, in, the, bible, but, also, in, the, babylonian, chronicle, which, describes, it, as, follows, the, seventh, year, in, the, month, of, kislimu, the, king, of, akkad, mustered, his, troops, marched, to, the, levant, and, set, up, quarters, facing, the, city, of, judah, in, the, month, of, addaru, the, second, day, he, took, the, city, and, captured, the, king, he, installed, there, a, king, of, his, choice, he, colle, its, massive, tribute, and, went, back, to, babylon, jehoiakim, had, died, during, nebuchadnezzar, s, siege, and, been, replaced, by, his, son, jeconiah, who, was, captured, and, taken, to, babylon, with, his, uncle, zedekiah, installed, in, his, place, as, king, of, judah, jeconiah, is, recorded, as, being, alive, in, babylonia, thereafter, with, records, as, late, as, 592, or, 591, bc, listing, him, among, the, recipients, of, food, at, nebuchadnezzar, s, palace, and, still, referring, to, him, as, the, king, of, the, land, of, judah, in, 597, bc, the, babylonian, army, departed, for, the, levant, again, but, appears, to, not, have, engaged, in, any, military, activities, as, they, turned, back, immediately, after, reaching, the, euphrates, the, following, year, nebuchadnezzar, marched, his, army, along, the, tigris, river, to, do, battle, with, the, elamites, but, no, actual, battle, happened, as, the, elamites, retreated, out, of, fear, once, nebuchadnezzar, was, a, day, s, march, away, in, 595, bc, nebuchadnezzar, stayed, at, home, in, babylon, but, soon, had, to, face, a, rebellion, against, his, rule, there, though, he, defeated, the, rebels, with, the, chronicle, stating, that, the, king, put, his, large, army, to, the, sword, and, conquered, his, foe, shortly, thereafter, nebuchadnezzar, again, campaigned, in, the, levant, and, secured, large, amounts, of, tribute, in, the, last, year, recorded, in, the, chronicle, 594, bc, nebuchadnezzar, campaigned, in, the, levant, yet, again, there, were, several, years, without, any, noteworthy, military, activity, at, all, notably, nebuchadnezzar, spent, all, of, 600, bc, in, babylon, when, the, chronicle, excuses, the, king, by, stating, that, he, stayed, in, babylon, to, refit, his, numerous, horses, and, chariotry, some, of, the, years, when, nebuchadnezzar, was, victorious, can, also, hardly, be, considered, real, challenges, raiding, the, arabs, in, 599, bc, was, not, a, major, military, accomplishment, and, the, victory, over, judah, and, the, retreat, of, the, elamites, were, not, secured, on, the, battlefield, it, thus, appears, that, nebuchadnezzar, achieved, little, military, success, after, the, failure, of, his, invasion, of, egypt, nebuchadnezzar, s, poor, military, record, had, dangerous, geopolitical, consequences, according, to, the, bible, in, zedekiah, s, fourth, year, as, king, of, judah, 594, bc, the, kings, of, ammon, edom, moab, sidon, and, tyre, met, in, jerusalem, to, deal, with, the, possibility, of, throwing, off, babylonian, control, evidence, that, babylonian, control, was, beginning, to, unravel, is, also, clear, from, contemporary, babylonian, records, such, as, the, aforementioned, rebellion, in, babylonia, itself, as, well, as, records, of, a, man, being, executed, in, 594, bc, at, borspippa, for, breaking, his, oath, to, the, king, the, oath, breaking, was, serious, enough, that, the, judge, in, the, trial, was, nebuchadnezzar, himself, it, is, also, possible, that, babylonian, median, relations, were, becoming, strained, with, records, of, a, median, defector, being, housed, in, nebuchadnezzar, s, palace, and, some, inscriptions, indicating, that, the, medes, were, beginning, to, be, seen, as, enemies, by, 594, bc, the, failure, of, the, egyptian, invasion, and, the, lacklustre, state, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, other, campaigns, loomed, high, according, to, the, assyriologist, israel, eph, al, babylon, at, this, time, was, seen, by, its, contemporaries, more, like, a, paper, tiger, i, e, an, ineffectual, threat, than, a, great, empire, like, assyria, just, a, few, decades, prior, from, his, appointment, as, king, of, judah, zedekiah, waited, for, the, opportune, moment, to, throw, off, babylonian, control, after, pharaoh, necho, ii, s, death, in, 595, bc, egyptian, intervention, in, affairs, in, the, levant, increased, once, again, under, his, successors, psamtik, ii, r, 595, 589, bc, and, apries, r, 589, 570, bc, who, both, worked, to, encourage, anti, babylonian, rebellions, it, is, possible, that, the, babylonian, failure, to, invade, egypt, in, 601, bc, helped, inspire, revolts, against, the, babylonian, empire, the, outcome, of, these, efforts, was, zedekiah, s, open, revolt, against, nebuchadnezzar, s, authority, unfortunately, no, cuneiform, sources, are, preserved, from, this, time, and, the, only, known, account, of, the, fall, of, judah, is, the, biblical, account, in, 589, bc, zedekiah, refused, to, pay, tribute, to, nebuchadnezzar, and, he, was, closely, followed, in, this, by, ithobaal, iii, the, king, of, tyre, in, 587, bc, ammon, edom, and, moab, likewise, rebelled, in, response, to, zedekiah, s, uprising, nebuchadnezzar, conquered, and, destroyed, the, kingdom, of, judah, in, 586, bc, one, of, the, great, achievements, of, his, reign, the, campaign, which, probably, ended, in, the, summer, of, 586, bc, resulted, in, the, plunder, and, destruction, of, the, city, of, jerusalem, a, permanent, end, to, judah, and, it, led, to, the, babylonian, captivity, as, the, jews, were, captured, and, deported, to, babylonia, archaeological, excavations, confirm, that, jerusalem, and, the, surrounding, area, was, destroyed, and, depopulated, it, is, possible, that, the, intensity, of, the, destruction, carried, out, by, nebuchadnezzar, at, jerusalem, and, elsewhere, in, the, levant, was, due, to, the, implementation, of, something, akin, to, a, scorched, earth, policy, aimed, at, stopping, egypt, from, gaining, a, foothold, there, some, jewish, administration, was, allowed, to, remain, in, the, region, under, the, governor, gedaliah, governing, from, mizpah, under, close, babylonian, monitoring, according, to, the, bible, and, the, 1st, century, ad, jewish, historian, flavius, josephus, zedekiah, attempted, to, flee, after, resisting, the, babylonians, but, was, captured, at, jericho, and, suffered, a, terrible, fate, according, to, the, narrative, nebuchadnezzar, wanted, to, make, an, example, out, of, him, given, that, zedekiah, was, not, an, ordinary, vassal, but, a, vassal, directly, appointed, by, nebuchadnezzar, as, such, zedekiah, was, supposedly, taken, to, riblah, in, northern, syria, where, he, had, to, watch, his, sons, being, executed, before, having, his, eyes, gouged, out, and, sent, to, be, imprisoned, in, babylon, per, the, books, of, kings, in, the, bible, the, campaign, against, judah, was, longer, than, typical, mesopotamian, wars, with, the, siege, of, jerusalem, lasting, 18, 30, months, depending, on, the, calculation, rather, than, the, typical, length, of, less, than, a, year, whether, the, unusual, length, of, the, siege, indicates, that, the, babylonian, army, was, weak, unable, to, break, into, the, city, for, more, than, a, year, or, that, nebuchadnezzar, by, this, time, had, succeeded, in, stabilising, his, rule, in, babylonia, and, could, thus, wage, war, patiently, without, being, pressured, by, time, to, escalate, the, siege, is, not, certain, it, is, possible, that, the, egyptians, took, advantage, of, the, babylonians, being, preoccupied, with, besieging, jerusalem, herodotus, describes, pharaoh, apries, as, campaigning, in, the, levant, taking, the, city, of, sidon, and, fighting, the, tyrians, which, indicates, a, renewed, egyptian, invasion, of, the, levant, apries, is, unlikely, to, have, been, as, successful, as, herodotus, describes, given, that, it, is, unclear, how, the, egyptian, navy, would, have, defeated, the, superior, navies, of, the, phoenician, cities, and, even, if, some, cities, had, been, taken, they, must, have, shortly, thereafter, fallen, into, babylonian, hands, again, tyre, had, rebelled, against, nebuchadnezzar, at, around, the, same, time, as, judah, and, nebuchadnezzar, moved, to, retake, the, city, after, his, successful, subduing, of, the, jews, the, biblical, book, of, ezekiel, describes, tyre, in, 571, bc, as, if, it, had, been, recently, captured, by, the, babylonian, army, the, supposed, length, of, the, siege, 13, years, is, only, given, by, flavius, josephus, and, is, subject, to, debate, among, modern, scholars, josephus, s, account, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, is, obviously, not, entirely, historic, as, he, describes, nebuchadnezzar, as, five, years, after, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, invading, egypt, capturing, the, pharaoh, and, appointing, another, pharaoh, in, his, place, a, stele, from, tahpanhes, uncovered, in, 2011, records, that, nebuchadnezzar, attempted, to, invade, egypt, in, 582, bc, although, apries, forces, managed, to, repel, the, invasion, josephus, states, that, nebuchadnezzar, besieged, tyre, in, the, seventh, year, of, his, reign, though, it, is, unclear, whether, his, in, this, context, refers, to, nebuchadnezzar, or, to, ithobaal, iii, of, tyre, if, it, refers, to, nebuchadnezzar, a, siege, begun, in, 598, bc, and, lasting, for, thirteen, years, later, simultaneously, with, the, siege, of, jerusalem, is, unlikely, to, have, gone, unmentioned, in, babylonian, records, if, the, seventh, year, of, ithobaal, is, intended, the, beginning, of, the, siege, may, conjecturally, be, placed, after, jerusalem, s, fall, if, the, siege, lasting, 13, years, is, taken, at, face, value, the, siege, would, then, not, have, ended, before, 573, or, 572, bc, the, supposed, length, of, the, siege, can, be, ascribed, to, the, difficulty, in, besieging, the, city, tyre, was, located, on, an, island, 800, metres, from, the, coast, and, could, not, be, taken, without, naval, support, though, the, city, withstood, numerous, sieges, it, would, not, be, captured, until, alexander, the, great, s, siege, in, 332, bc, in, the, end, the, siege, was, resolved, without, a, need, of, battle, and, did, not, result, in, the, tyre, being, conquered, it, seems, tyre, s, king, and, nebuchadnezzar, came, to, an, agreement, for, tyre, to, continue, to, be, ruled, by, vassal, kings, though, probably, under, heavier, babylonian, control, than, before, documents, from, tyre, near, the, end, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, demonstrate, that, the, city, had, become, a, centre, for, babylonian, military, affairs, in, the, region, according, to, later, jewish, tradition, it, is, possible, that, ithobaal, iii, was, deposed, and, taken, as, a, prisoner, to, babylon, with, another, king, baal, ii, proclaimed, by, nebuchadnezzar, in, his, place, it, is, possible, that, nebuchadnezzar, campaigned, against, egypt, in, 568, bc, given, that, a, fragmentary, babylonian, inscription, given, the, modern, designation, bm, 33041, from, that, year, records, the, word, egypt, as, well, as, possibly, traces, of, the, name, amasis, the, name, of, the, then, incumbent, pharaoh, amasis, ii, r, 570, 526, bc, a, stele, of, amasis, also, fragmentary, may, also, describe, a, combined, naval, and, land, attack, by, the, babylonians, recent, evidence, suggests, that, the, babylonians, were, initially, successful, during, the, invasion, and, gained, a, foothold, in, egypt, but, they, were, repelled, by, amasis, forces, if, nebuchadnezzar, did, campaign, against, egypt, again, he, was, unsuccessful, again, given, that, egypt, did, not, come, under, babylonian, rule, nebuchadnezzar, s, campaigns, in, the, levant, most, notably, those, directed, towards, jerusalem, and, tyre, completed, the, neo, babylonian, empire, s, transformation, from, a, rump, state, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, to, the, new, dominant, power, of, the, ancient, near, east, still, nebuchadnezzar, s, military, accomplishments, can, be, questioned, given, that, the, borders, of, his, empire, by, the, end, of, his, reign, had, not, noticeably, increased, in, size, and, that, he, had, not, managed, to, conquer, egypt, even, after, a, reign, of, several, decades, nebuchadnezzar, s, greatest, victory, remained, his, victory, over, the, egyptians, at, carchemish, in, 605, bc, before, he, even, became, king, the, babylonian, king, was, traditionally, a, builder, and, restorer, and, as, such, large, scale, building, projects, were, important, as, a, legitimizing, factor, for, babylonian, rulers, nebuchadnezzar, extensively, expanded, and, rebuilt, his, capital, city, of, babylon, and, the, most, modern, historical, and, archaeological, interpretations, of, the, city, reflect, it, as, it, appeared, after, nebuchadnezzar, s, construction, projects, the, projects, were, made, possible, through, the, prospering, economy, during, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, sustained, by, his, conquests, his, building, inscriptions, record, work, done, to, numerous, temples, notably, the, restoration, of, the, esagila, the, main, temple, of, babylon, s, national, deity, marduk, and, the, completion, of, the, etemenanki, a, great, ziggurat, dedicated, to, marduk, extensive, work, was, also, conducted, on, civil, and, military, structures, among, the, most, impressive, efforts, was, the, work, done, surrounding, the, city, s, northern, ceremonial, entrance, the, ishtar, gate, these, projects, included, restoration, work, on, the, south, palace, inside, the, city, walls, the, construction, of, a, completely, new, north, palace, on, the, other, side, of, the, walls, facing, the, gate, as, well, as, the, restoration, of, babylon, s, processional, street, which, led, through, the, gate, and, of, the, gate, itself, the, ruins, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, north, palace, are, poorly, preserved, and, as, such, its, structure, and, appearance, are, not, entirely, understood, nebuchadnezzar, also, constructed, a, third, palace, the, summer, palace, built, some, distance, north, of, the, inner, city, walls, in, the, northernmost, corner, of, the, outer, walls, the, restored, ishtar, gate, was, decorated, with, blue, and, yellow, glazed, bricks, and, depictions, of, bulls, symbols, of, the, god, adad, and, dragons, symbols, of, the, god, marduk, similar, bricks, were, used, for, the, walls, surrounding, the, processional, street, which, also, featured, depictions, of, lions, symbols, of, the, goddess, ishtar, babylon, s, processional, street, the, only, such, street, yet, excavated, in, mesopotamia, ran, along, the, eastern, walls, of, the, south, palace, and, exited, the, inner, city, walls, at, the, ishtar, gate, running, past, the, north, palace, to, the, south, this, street, went, by, the, etemenanki, turning, to, the, west, and, going, over, a, bridge, constructed, either, under, the, reign, of, nabopolassar, or, nebuchadnezzar, some, of, the, bricks, of, the, processional, street, bear, the, name, of, the, neo, assyrian, king, sennacherib, r, 705, 681, bc, on, their, underside, perhaps, indicating, that, construction, of, the, street, had, begun, already, during, his, reign, but, the, fact, that, the, upper, side, of, the, bricks, all, bear, the, name, of, nebuchadnezzar, suggests, that, construction, of, the, street, was, completed, under, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, glazed, bricks, such, as, the, ones, used, in, the, procession, street, were, also, used, in, the, throne, room, of, the, south, palace, which, was, decorated, with, depictions, of, lions, and, tall, stylized, palm, trees, nebuchadnezzar, also, directed, building, efforts, on, the, city, of, borsippa, with, several, of, his, inscriptions, recording, restoration, work, on, that, city, s, temple, the, ezida, dedicated, to, the, god, nabu, additionally, nebuchadnezzar, also, restored, the, ziggurat, of, the, ezida, the, e, urme, imin, anki, and, also, worked, on, the, temple, of, gula, etila, as, well, as, numerous, other, temples, and, shrines, in, the, city, nebuchadnezzar, also, repaired, borsippa, s, walls, other, great, building, projects, by, nebuchadnezzar, include, the, nar, shamash, a, canal, to, bring, water, from, the, euphrates, close, to, the, city, of, sippar, and, the, median, wall, a, large, defensive, structure, built, to, defend, babylonia, against, incursions, from, the, north, the, median, wall, was, one, of, two, walls, built, to, protect, babylonia, s, northern, border, further, evidence, that, nebuchadnezzar, believed, the, north, to, be, the, most, likely, point, of, attack, for, his, enemies, comes, from, that, he, fortified, the, walls, of, northern, cities, such, as, babylon, borsippa, and, kish, but, left, the, walls, of, southern, cities, such, as, ur, and, uruk, as, they, were, nebuchadnezzar, also, began, work, on, the, royal, canal, also, known, as, nebuchadnezzar, s, canal, a, great, canal, linking, the, euphrates, to, the, tigris, which, in, time, completely, transformed, the, agriculture, of, the, region, but, the, structure, was, not, completed, until, the, reign, of, nabonidus, who, ruled, as, the, last, king, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, from, 556, to, 539, bc, nebuchadnezzar, died, at, babylon, in, 562, bc, the, last, known, tablet, dated, to, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, from, uruk, is, dated, to, the, same, day, 7, october, as, the, first, known, tablet, of, his, successor, amel, marduk, from, sippar, amel, marduk, s, administrative, duties, probably, began, before, he, became, king, during, the, last, few, weeks, or, months, of, his, father, s, reign, when, nebuchadnezzar, was, ill, and, dying, having, ruled, for, 43, years, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, was, the, longest, of, his, dynasty, and, he, would, be, remembered, favourably, by, the, babylonians, amel, marduk, s, accession, does, not, appear, to, have, gone, smoothly, amel, marduk, was, not, the, eldest, living, son, of, nebuchadnezzar, and, the, reason, why, he, was, picked, as, crown, prince, is, not, known, the, choice, is, especially, strange, given, that, some, sources, suggest, that, the, relationship, between, nebuchadnezzar, and, amel, marduk, was, particularly, poor, with, one, surviving, text, describing, both, as, parties, in, some, form, of, conspiracy, and, accusing, one, of, them, the, text, is, too, fragmentary, to, determine, which, one, of, failing, in, the, most, important, duties, of, babylonian, kingship, through, exploiting, babylon, s, populace, and, desecrating, its, temples, amel, marduk, also, at, one, point, appears, to, have, been, imprisoned, by, his, father, possibly, on, account, of, the, babylonian, aristocracy, having, proclaimed, him, as, king, while, nebuchadnezzar, was, away, it, is, possible, that, nebuchadnezzar, intended, to, replace, amel, marduk, as, heir, with, another, son, but, died, before, doing, so, in, one, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, late, inscriptions, written, more, than, forty, years, into, his, reign, he, wrote, that, he, had, been, chosen, for, the, kingship, by, the, gods, before, he, was, even, born, mesopotamian, rulers, typically, only, stressed, divine, legitimacy, in, this, fashion, when, their, actual, legitimacy, was, questionable, a, method, often, employed, by, usurpers, given, that, nebuchadnezzar, at, this, point, had, been, king, for, several, decades, and, was, the, legitimate, heir, of, his, predecessor, the, inscription, is, very, strange, unless, it, was, intended, to, help, legitimize, nebuchadnezzar, s, successor, amel, marduk, who, as, a, younger, son, and, a, former, conspirator, could, be, seen, as, politically, problematic, no, surviving, contemporary, babylonian, documents, provide, the, name, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, wife, according, to, berossus, her, name, was, amytis, daughter, of, astyages, king, of, the, medes, berossus, writes, that, sent, troops, to, the, assistance, of, astyages, the, tribal, chieftain, and, satrap, of, the, medes, in, order, to, obtain, a, daughter, of, astyages, amyitis, as, wife, for, his, son, though, the, ancient, greek, historian, ctesias, instead, wrote, that, amytis, was, the, name, of, a, daughter, of, astyages, who, had, married, cyrus, i, of, persia, it, seems, more, likely, that, a, median, princess, would, marry, a, member, of, the, babylonian, royal, family, considering, the, good, relations, established, between, the, two, during, nabopolassar, s, reign, given, that, astyages, was, still, too, young, during, nabopolassar, s, reign, to, already, have, children, and, was, not, yet, king, it, seems, more, probable, that, amytis, was, astyages, s, sister, and, thus, a, daughter, of, his, predecessor, cyaxares, by, marrying, his, son, to, a, daughter, of, cyaxares, nebuchadnezzar, s, father, nabopolassar, likely, sought, to, seal, the, alliance, between, the, babylonians, and, the, medes, according, to, tradition, nebuchadnezzar, constructed, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, featuring, exotic, shrubs, vines, and, trees, as, well, as, artificial, hills, watercourses, and, knolls, so, that, amytis, would, feel, less, homesick, for, the, mountains, of, media, no, archaeological, evidence, for, these, gardens, has, yet, been, found, nebuchadnezzar, had, six, known, sons, most, of, the, sons, with, the, exceptions, of, marduk, nadin, ahi, and, eanna, sharra, usur, are, attested, very, late, in, their, father, s, reign, it, is, possible, that, they, might, have, been, the, product, of, a, second, marriage, and, that, they, could, have, been, born, relatively, late, in, nebuchadnezzar, s, reign, possibly, after, his, known, daughters, the, known, sons, of, nebuchadnezzar, are, three, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, daughters, are, known, by, name, it, is, possible, that, one, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, daughters, married, the, high, official, nabonidus, marriage, to, a, daughter, of, nebuchadnezzar, could, explain, how, nabonidus, could, become, king, and, also, explain, why, certain, later, traditions, such, as, the, book, of, daniel, in, the, bible, describe, nabonidus, s, son, belshazzar, as, nebuchadnezzar, s, son, descendant, alternatively, these, later, traditions, might, instead, derive, from, royal, propaganda, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, names, the, last, great, queen, of, the, babylonian, empire, as, nitocris, though, that, name, nor, any, other, name, is, not, attested, in, contemporary, babylonian, sources, herodotus, s, description, of, nitocris, contains, a, wealth, of, legendary, material, that, makes, it, difficult, to, determine, whether, he, uses, the, name, to, refer, to, nabonidus, s, wife, or, mother, in, 1982, william, h, shea, proposed, that, nitocris, may, tentatively, be, identified, as, the, name, of, nabonidus, s, wife, and, belshazzar, s, mother, because, of, the, scarcity, of, sources, assessment, by, historians, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, character, and, the, nature, of, his, reign, have, differed, considerably, over, time, he, has, typically, been, regarded, as, the, greatest, and, most, prestigious, king, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, since, military, activity, was, not, a, major, issue, described, in, the, inscriptions, of, any, neo, babylonian, king, regardless, of, their, actual, military, accomplishments, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, inscriptions, of, their, neo, assyrian, predecessors, nebuchadnezzar, s, own, inscriptions, record, very, little, about, his, wars, out, of, the, fifty, or, so, known, inscriptions, by, the, king, only, a, single, one, deals, with, military, action, and, in, this, case, only, small, scale, conflicts, in, the, lebanon, region, many, assyriologists, such, as, wolfram, von, soden, in, 1954, thus, initially, assumed, that, nebuchadnezzar, had, mainly, been, a, builder, king, devoting, his, energy, and, efforts, to, building, and, restoring, his, country, a, major, change, in, evaluations, of, nebuchadnezzar, came, with, the, publication, of, the, tablets, of, the, babylonian, chronicle, by, donald, wiseman, in, 1956, which, cover, the, geopolitical, events, of, nebuchadnezzar, s, first, eleven, years, as, king, from, the, publication, of, these, tablets, and, onwards, historians, have, shifted, to, perceiving, nebuchadnezzar, as, a, great, warrior, devoting, special, attention, to, the, military, achievements, of, his, reign, according, to, the, historian, josette, elayi, writing, in, 2018, nebuchadnezzar, is, somewhat, difficult, to, characterise, on, account, of, the, scarcity, of, babylonian, source, material, elayi, wrote, about, nebuchadnezzar, that, e, was, a, conqueror, even, though, reservations, can, be, had, about, his, military, capabilities, there, was, no, lack, of, statesmanlike, qualities, given, his, success, in, building, the, babylonian, empire, he, was, a, great, builder, who, restored, a, country, that, for, a, long, time, had, been, devastated, by, war, that, is, roughly, all, we, know, about, him, because, the, babylonian, chronicles, and, other, texts, say, little, about, his, personality, the, babylonian, captivity, initiated, by, nebuchadnezzar, came, to, an, end, with, the, fall, of, babylon, to, the, achaemenid, king, cyrus, the, great, in, 539, bc, within, a, year, of, their, liberation, some, exiled, jews, returned, to, their, homeland, their, liberation, did, little, to, erase, the, memory, of, five, decades, of, imprisonment, and, oppression, instead, jewish, literary, accounts, ensured, that, accounts, of, the, hardship, endured, by, the, jews, as, well, as, of, the, monarch, responsible, for, it, would, be, remembered, for, all, time, the, book, of, jeremiah, calls, nebuchadnezzar, a, lion, and, a, destroyer, of, nations, nebuchadnezzar, s, story, thus, found, its, way, into, the, old, testament, of, the, bible, the, bible, narrates, how, nebuchadnezzar, destroyed, the, kingdom, of, judah, besieged, plundered, and, destroyed, jerusalem, and, how, he, took, away, the, jews, in, captivity, portraying, him, as, a, cruel, enemy, of, the, jewish, people, the, bible, also, portrays, nebuchadnezzar, as, the, legitimate, ruler, of, all, the, nations, of, the, world, appointed, to, rule, the, world, by, god, as, such, judah, through, divine, ruling, should, have, obeyed, nebuchadnezzar, and, should, not, have, rebelled, nebuchadnezzar, is, also, depicted, as, carrying, out, death, sentences, pronounced, by, god, slaying, two, false, prophets, nebuchadnezzar, s, campaigns, of, conquest, against, other, nations, are, portrayed, as, being, in, line, with, god, s, will, for, nebuchadnezzar, s, dominance, despite, nebuchadnezzar, s, negative, portrayal, the, book, of, jeremiah, notably, refers, to, him, using, the, epithet, my, servant, i, e, god, s, servant, in, three, passages, given, that, nebuchadnezzar, was, the, enemy, of, what, the, bible, proclaims, as, god, s, chosen, people, possibly, the, worst, enemy, they, had, faced, until, this, point, there, must, be, a, special, reason, for, referring, to, him, with, the, epithet, my, servant, other, uses, of, this, epithet, are, usually, limited, to, some, of, the, most, positively, portrayed, figures, such, as, the, various, prophets, jacob, the, symbol, of, the, chosen, people, and, david, the, chosen, king, klaas, a, d, smelik, noted, in, 2004, that, in, the, hebrew, bible, there, is, no, better, company, conceivable, than, these, at, the, same, time, there, is, no, candidate, less, likely, for, this, title, of, honour, than, the, babylonian, king, nebuchadnezzar, it, is, possible, that, the, epithet, is, a, later, addition, as, it, is, missing, in, the, septuagint, version, of, the, old, testament, perhaps, added, after, nebuchadnezzar, began, to, be, seen, in, a, slightly, more, favourable, light, than, immediately, after, jerusalem, s, destruction, alternatively, possible, theological, explanations, include, nebuchadnezzar, being, seen, despite, his, cruelty, as, an, instrument, in, fulfilling, god, s, universal, plan, or, perhaps, that, designating, him, as, a, servant, of, god, was, to, show, that, readers, should, not, fear, nebuchadnezzar, but, his, true, master, god, in, the, book, of, daniel, considered, by, scholars, to, be, a, work, of, historical, fiction, the, figure, of, nebuchadnezzar, differs, considerably, from, his, portrayal, in, the, book, of, jeremiah, he, is, for, the, most, part, depicted, as, a, merciless, and, despotic, ruler, the, king, has, a, nightmare, and, asks, his, wise, men, including, daniel, and, his, three, companions, shadrach, meshach, and, abednego, to, interpret, the, dream, but, refuses, to, state, the, dream, s, contents, when, the, servants, protest, nebuchadnezzar, sentences, all, of, them, including, daniel, and, his, companions, to, death, by, the, end, of, the, story, when, daniel, has, successfully, interpreted, the, dream, nebuchadnezzar, shows, much, gratitude, showering, daniel, with, gifts, appointing, him, the, governor, of, the, province, of, babylon, and, making, him, the, chief, of, the, kingdom, s, wise, men, a, second, story, again, casts, nebuchadnezzar, as, a, tyrannical, and, pagan, king, who, after, shadrach, meshach, and, abednego, refuse, to, worship, a, newly, erected, golden, statue, sentences, them, to, death, through, being, thrown, into, a, fiery, furnace, they, are, miraculously, delivered, and, nebuchadnezzar, then, acknowledges, god, as, the, lord, of, kings, and, god, of, gods, though, nebuchadnezzar, is, also, mentioned, as, acknowledging, the, hebrews, god, as, the, true, god, in, other, passages, of, the, book, of, daniel, it, is, apparent, that, his, supposed, conversion, to, judaism, does, not, change, his, violent, character, given, that, he, proclaims, that, anyone, who, speaks, amiss, of, god, shall, be, cut, in, pieces, and, their, houses, shall, be, made, a, dunghill, in, a, third, story, daniel, interprets, another, dream, as, meaning, that, nebuchadnezzar, will, lose, his, mind, and, live, like, an, animal, for, seven, years, before, being, restored, to, his, normal, state, daniel, 1, 4, the, nebuchadnezzar, in, the, book, of, daniel, a, fickle, tyrant, who, is, not, particularly, consistent, in, his, faith, contrasts, with, the, typical, servant, of, god, in, other, books, of, the, bible, given, that, nebuchadnezzar, is, referred, to, as, the, father, of, belshazzar, in, the, book, of, daniel, it, is, probable, that, this, portrayal, of, nebuchadnezzar, especially, the, story, of, his, madness, was, actually, based, on, belshazzar, s, actual, father, nabonidus, the, last, king, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, r, 556, 539, bc, separate, jewish, and, hellenistic, traditions, exist, concerning, nabonidus, having, been, mad, and, it, is, likely, that, this, madness, was, simply, reattributed, to, nebuchadnezzar, in, the, book, of, daniel, through, conflation, some, later, traditions, conflated, nebuchadnezzar, with, other, rulers, as, well, such, as, the, assyrian, ashurbanipal, r, 669, 631, bc, the, persian, artaxerxes, iii, r, 358, 338, bc, the, seleucids, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, r, 175, 164, bc, and, demetrius, i, soter, r, 161, 150, bc, and, the, armenian, tigranes, the, great, r, 95, 55, bc, the, apocryphal, book, of, judith, which, probably, applies, the, name, nebuchadnezzar, to, tigranes, the, great, of, armenia, refers, to, nebuchadnezzar, as, a, king, of, the, assyrians, rather, than, of, the, babylonians, and, demonstrates, that, nebuchadnezzar, was, still, viewed, as, an, evil, king, responsible, for, destroying, jerusalem, looting, its, temple, taking, the, jews, hostage, in, babylon, and, for, the, various, misdeeds, ascribed, to, him, in, later, jewish, writings, nebuchadnezzar, is, referred, to, as, bu, t, nu, ur, in, works, of, the, mediaeval, scholar, al, abar, where, he, is, credited, with, conquering, egypt, syria, phoenicia, and, arabia, the, historical, nebuchadnezzar, never, conquered, egypt, and, it, appears, that, al, abar, transferred, to, him, the, achievements, of, the, assyrian, king, esarhaddon, r, 681, 669, in, similar, fashion, strabo, citing, megasthenes, mentioned, in, a, list, of, mythical, and, semi, legendary, conquerors, a, nabocodrosor, as, having, led, an, army, to, the, pillars, of, hercules, and, being, revered, by, the, chaldaeans, in, most, of, his, inscriptions, nebuchadnezzar, is, typically, only, titled, as, nebuchadnezzar, king, of, babylon, son, of, nabopolassar, king, of, babylon, or, nebuchadnezzar, king, of, babylon, the, one, who, provides, for, esagil, and, ezida, son, of, nabopolassar, king, of, babylon, in, economic, documents, nebuchadnezzar, is, also, ascribed, the, ancient, title, king, of, the, universe, and, he, sometimes, also, used, the, title, king, of, sumer, and, akkad, used, by, all, the, neo, babylonian, kings, some, inscriptions, accord, nebuchadnezzar, more, elaborate, version, of, his, titles, including, the, following,
