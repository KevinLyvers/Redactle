having, assured, shivaji, of, his, personal, safety, tried, to, influence, aurangzeb, s, decision, meanwhile, shivaji, hatched, a, plan, to, free, himself, he, sent, most, of, his, men, back, home,

which, aurangzeb, became, suspicious, of, the, close, ties, between, shivaji, and, mu, azzam, who, he, thought, might, usurp, his, throne, and, may, even, have, been, receiving, bribes, from, shivaji, also, at, that, time, aurangzeb, occupied, in, fighting, the, afghans, greatly, reduced, his, army, in, the, deccan, many, of, the, disbanded, soldiers, quickly, joined, maratha, service, the,

they, had, refused, to, sell, him, war, materiel, his, forces, blocked, english, woodcutting, parties, from, leaving, bombay, in, september, 1671, shivaji, sent, an, ambassador, to, bombay, again, seeking, materiel, this, time, for, the, fight, against, danda, rajpuri, the, english, had, misgivings, of, the, advantages, shivaji, would, gain, from, this, conquest, but, also, did, not, want, to, lose, any, chance, of, receiving, compensation, for, his, looting, their, factories, at, rajapur, the, english, sent, lieutenant, stephen, ustick, to, treat, with, shivaji, but, negotiations, failed, over, the, issue, of, the, rajapur, indemnity, numerous, exchanges, of, envoys, followed, over, the, coming, years, with, some, agreement, as, to, the, arms, issues, in, 1674, but, shivaji, was, never, to, pay, the, rajapur, indemnity, before, his, death, and, the, factory, there, dissolved, at, the, end, of, 1682, in, 1674, prataprao, gujar, the, sarnaubat, commander, in, chief, of, the, maratha, forces, was, sent, to, push, back, the, invading, force, led, by, the, bijapuri, general, bahlol, khan, prataprao, s, forces, defeated, and, captured, the, opposing, general, in, the, battle, after, cutting, off, their, water, supply, by, encircling, a, strategic, lake, which, prompted, bahlol, khan, to, sue, for, peace, in, spite, of, shivaji, s, specific, warnings, against, doing, so, prataprao, released, bahlol, khan, who, started, preparing, for, a, fresh, invasion, shivaji, sent, a, letter, to, prataprao, expressing, his, displeasure, and, refusing, him, an, audience, until, bahlol, khan, was, re, captured, upset, by, this, rebuke, prataprao, found, bahlol, khan, and, charged, his, position, with, only, six, other, horsemen, leaving, his, main, force, behind, and, was, killed, in, combat, shivaji, was, deeply, grieved, on, hearing, of, prataprao, s, death, and, arranged, for, the, marriage, of, his, second, son, rajaram, to, prataprao, s, daughter, prataprao, was, succeeded, by, hambirrao, mohite, as, the, new, sarnaubat, raigad, fort, was, newly, built, by, hiroji, indulkar, as, a, capital, of, the, nascent, maratha, kingdom, shivaji, had, acquired, extensive, lands, and, wealth, through, his, campaigns, but, lacking, a, formal, title, he, was, still, technically, a, mughal, zamindar, or, the, son, of, a, bijapuri, jagirdar, with, no, legal, basis, to, rule, his, de, facto, domain, a, kingly, title, could, address, this, and, also, prevent, any, challenges, by, other, maratha, leaders, who, were, his, equals, such, a, title, would, also, provide, the, hindu, marathis, with, a, fellow, hindu, sovereign, in, a, region, otherwise, ruled, by, muslims, the, preparation, for, a, proposed, coronation, began, in, 1673, however, some, controversies, delayed, the, coronation, by, almost, a, year, one, controversy, erupted, amongst, the, brahmins, of, shivaji, s, court, they, refused, to, crown, shivaji, as, a, king, because, that, status, was, reserved, for, those, of, the, kshatriya, varna, warrior, class, in, hindu, society, shivaji, was, descended, from, a, line, of, headmen, of, farming, villages, and, the, brahmins, accordingly, categorised, him, as, a, maratha, not, a, kshatriya, they, noted, that, shivaji, had, never, had, a, sacred, thread, ceremony, and, did, not, wear, the, thread, such, as, a, kshatriya, would, shivaji, summoned, gaga, bhatt, a, pandit, of, varanasi, who, stated, that, he, had, found, a, genealogy, proving, that, shivaji, was, descended, from, the, sisodias, and, thus, indeed, a, kshatriya, albeit, one, in, need, of, the, ceremonies, befitting, his, rank, to, enforce, this, status, shivaji, was, given, a, sacred, thread, ceremony, and, remarried, his, spouses, under, the, vedic, rites, expected, of, a, kshatriya, however, according, to, historical, evidence, shivaji, s, claim, to, rajput, and, specifically, of, sisodia, ancestry, may, be, seen, as, being, anything, from, tenuous, at, best,

for, 12, days, in, a, contemporary, work, in, portuguese, in, the, biblioteca, nacional, de, lisboa, the, recorded, cause, of, death, of, shivaji, is, anthrax, however, krishnaji, anant, sabhasad, author, of, sabhasad, bakhar, a, biography, of, shivaji, has, mentioned, fever, as, the, cause, of, death, putalabai, the, childless, eldest, of, the, surviving, wives, of, shivaji, committed, sati, by, jumping, into, his, funeral, pyre, another, surviving, spouse, sakwarbai, was, not, allowed, to, follow, suit, because, she, had, a, young, daughter, there, were, also, allegations, though, doubted, by, later, scholars, that, his, second, wife, soyarabai, had, poisoned, him, in, order, to, put, her, 10, year, old, son, rajaram, on, the, throne, after, shivaji, s, death, soyarabai, made, plans, with, various, ministers, to, crown, her, son, rajaram, rather, than, her, stepson, sambhaji, on, 21, april, 1680, ten, year, old, rajaram, was, installed, on, the, throne, however, sambhaji,

offensive, in, the, south, to, capture, territories, held, by, the, marathas, the, adil, shahi, of, bijapur, and, qutb, shahi, of, golconda, he, was, successful, in, obliterating, the, adil, shahi, and, qutb, shahi, dynasties, but, he, could, not, subdue, the, marathas, better, known, as, the, mughal, maratha, wars, this, campaign, nominally, increased, the, size, of, mughal, empire, but, ended, in, a, strategic, defeat, and, had, a, ruinous, effect, on, mughal, empire, aurangzeb, spent, 27, years, in, deccan, but, ultimately, failed, to, achieve, his, objective, of, conquering, the, marathas, while, draining, the, mughal, treasury, and, almost, irreparably, damaging, the, strength, and, morale, of, the, mughal, army, according, to, contemporary, sources, about, 2, 5, million, of, aurangzeb, s, army, were, killed, during, the, mughal, maratha, wars, 100, 000, annually, over, a, quarter, century, while, 2, million, civilians, in, war, torn, lands, died, due, to, drought, plague, and, famine, shahu, a, grandson, of, shivaji, and, son, of, sambhaji, was, kept, prisoner, by, aurangzeb, during, the, 27, year, conflict, after, the, latter, s, death, his, successor, released, shahu, after, a, brief, power, struggle, with, his, aunt, tarabai, over, the, succession, shahu, ruled, the, maratha, empire, from, 1707, to, 1749, early, in, his, reign, he, appointed, balaji, vishwanath, and, later, his, descendants, as, peshwas, prime, ministers, of, the, maratha, empire, the, empire, expanded, greatly, under, the, leadership, of, balaji, s, son, peshwa, bajirao, i, and, grandson, peshwa, balaji, bajirao, in, a, bid, to, effectively, manage, the, large, empire, shahu, and, the, peshwas, gave, semi, autonomy, to, the, strongest, of, the, lords, gaekwads, of, baroda, the, holkars, of, indore, and, malwa, the, scindias, of, gwalior, and, bhonsales, of, nagpur, thus, creating, the, maratha, confederacy, shivaji, s, greatest, legacy, was, laying, the, foundation, for, the, maratha, empire, which, played, a, significant, role, in, undermining, the, military, and, economic, strength, and, prestige, of, the, mughal, empire, soon, after, aurangzeb, s, death, in, 1707, marathas, started, to, capture, mughal, dominions, by, 1734, marathas, were, firmly, established, in, malwa, by, 1737, marathas, had, carried, out, raids, as, far, as, bundelkhand, rajputana,

marathas, in, the, 1750s, the, frontier, extended, north, to, delhi, in, this, period, the, mughal, government, directly, controlled, little, territory, further, than, fifty, miles, from, the, capital, even, this, was, fiercely, fought, over, jats, and, rohillas, disputed, for, the, territory, factions, fought, for, the, throne, and, the, afghan, king, ahmad, shah, abdali, periodically, descended, on, the, capital, for, the, marathas, probably, the, two, most, significant, events, of, the, whole, chaotic, period, in, delhi, were, a, treaty, in, 1752, which, made, them, protector, of, the, mughal, throne, and, gave, them, the, right, to, collect, chauth, in, the, punjab, and, the, civil, war, of, 1753, by, which, the, maratha, nominee, ended, up, on, the, mughal, throne, cambridge,

orissa, in, the, east, in, 1761, the, maratha, army, lost, the, third, battle, of, panipat, to, ahmed, shah, durrani, of, the, afghan, empire, which, is, considered, a, big, setback, for, the, marathas, however, the, marathas, soon, recovered, ten, years, after, panipat, marathas, regained, influence, in, north, india, during, the, rule, of, madhav, rao, ii, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, british, east, india, company, was, increasing, its, strength, in, india, charles, metcalfe, a, british, official, and, later, acting, governor, general, said, in, 1806, india,

company, the, dominant, power, in, most, of, india, the, council, of, eight, ministers, or, ashta, pradhan, mandal, was, an, administrative, and, advisory, council, set, up, by, shivaji, it, consisted, of, eight, ministers, who, regularly, advised, shivaji, on, political, and, administrative, matters, the, eight, ministers, were, as, follows, except, the, panditrao, and, nyayadhis, all, other, ministers, held, military, commands, their, civil, duties, often, being, performed, by, deputies, at, his, court, shivaji, replaced, persian, the, common, courtly, language, in, the, region, with, marathi, and, emphasised, hindu, political, and, courtly, traditions, shivaji, s, reign, stimulated, the, deployment, of, marathi, as, a, systematic, tool, of, description, and, understanding, shivaji, s, royal, seal, was, in, sanskrit, shivaji, commissioned, one, of, his, officials, to, make, a, comprehensive, lexicon, to, replace, persian, and, arabic, terms, with, their, sanskrit, equivalents, this, led, to, the, production, of, the, r, javyavah, rako, a, the, thesaurus, of, state, usage, in, 1677, many, modern, commentators, have, deemed, shivaji, s, religious, policies, as, tolerant, while, encouraging, hinduism, shivaji, not, only, allowed, muslims, to, practice, without, harassment, but, supported, their, ministries, with, endowments, when, aurangzeb, imposed, the, jizya, tax, on, non, muslims, on, 3, april, 1679, shivaji, wrote, an, admonishing, letter, to, aurangzeb, criticising, his, tax, policy, he, wrote, in, strict, justice, the, jizya, is, not, at, all, lawful, if, you, imagine, piety, in, oppressing, and, terrorising, the, hindus, you, ought, to, first, levy, the, tax, on, raj, singh, i, who, is, the, head, of, hindus, but, to, oppress, ants, and, flies, is, not, at, all, valour, nor, spirit, if, you, believe, in, quran, god, is, the, lord, of, all, men, and, not, just, of, muslims, only, verily, islam, and, hinduism, are, terms, of, contrast, they, are, used, by, the, true, divine, painter, for, blending, the, colours, and, filling, in, the, outlines, if, it, is, a, mosque, the, call, to, prayer, is, chanted, in, remembrance, of, god, if, it, is, a, temple, the, bells, are, rung, in, yearning, for, god, alone, to, show, bigotry, to, any, man, s, religion, and, practices, is, to, alter, the, words, of, the, holy, book, noting, that, shivaji, had, stemmed, the, spread, of, the, neighbouring, muslim, states, his, contemporary, the, poet, kavi, bhushan, stated, had, not, there, been, shivaji, kashi, would, have, lost, its, culture, mathura, would, have, been, turned, into, a, mosque, and, all, would, have, been, circumcised, however, gijs, kruijtzer, in, his, book, xenophobia, in, seventeenth, century, india, argues, that, the, roots, of, modern, communalism, the, antagonism, between, hindu, and, muslim, communities, first, appeared, in, the, decade, 1677, 1687, in, the, interplay, between, shivaji, and, the, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, though, shivaji, died, in, 1680, during, the, sack, of, surat, in, 1664, shivaji, was, approached, by, ambrose, a, capuchin, friar, who, asked, him, to, spare, the, city, s, christians, shivaji, left, the, christians, untouched, saying, the, frankish, padrys, are, good, men, shivaji, was, not, attempting, to, create, a, universal, hindu, rule, he, was, tolerant, of, different, religions, and, believed, in, syncretism, he, urged, aurangzeb, to, act, like, akbar, in, according, respect, to, hindu, beliefs, and, places, shivaji, had, little, trouble, forming, alliances, with, the, surrounding, muslim, nations, even, against, hindu, powers, he, also, did, not, join, forces, with, certain, other, hindu, powers, fighting, the, mughals, such, as, the, rajputs,

historian, stewart, gordon, concludes, about, their, relationship, older, maratha, histories, asserted, that, shivaji, was, a, close, follower, of, ramdas, a, brahmin, teacher, who, guided, him, in, an, orthodox, hindu, path, recent, research, has, shown, that, shivaji, did, not, meet, or, know, ramdas, until, late, in, his, life, rather, shivaji, followed, his, own, judgement, throughout, his, remarkable, career, seals, were, a, means, to, confer, authenticity, on, official, documents, shahaji, and, jijabai, had, persian, seals, but, shivaji, right, from, the, beginning, used, sanskrit, for, his, seal, the, seal, proclaims, this, seal, of, shiva, son, of, shah, shines, forth, for, the, welfare, of, the, people, and, is, meant, to, command, increasing, respect, from, the, universe, like, the, first, phase, of, the, moon, shivaji, maintained, a, small, but, effective, standing, army, the, core, of, shivaji, s, army, consisted, of, peasants, of, maratha, and, kunbi, castes, shivaji, was, aware, of, the, limitations, of, his, army, he, realised, that, conventional, warfare, methods, were, inadequate, to, confront, the, big, well, trained, cavalry, of, the, mughals, which, was, equipped, with, field, artillery, as, a, result, shivaji, mastered, guerilla, tactics, which, became, known, as, ganimi, kawa, in, the, marathi, language, his, strategies, consistently, perplexed, and, defeated, armies, sent, against, him, he, realized, that, the, most, vulnerable, point, of, the, large, slow, moving, armies, of, the, time, was, supply, he, utilised, knowledge, of, the, local, terrain, and, the, superior, mobility, of, his, light, cavalry, to, cut, off, supplies, to, the, enemy, shivaji, refused, to, confront, the, enemy, in, pitched, battles, instead, he, lured, the, enemies, into, difficult, hills, and, jungles, of, his, own, choosing, catching, them, at, a, disadvantage, and, routing, them, shivaji, did, not, adhere, to, a, particular, tactic, but, used, several, methods, to, undermine, his, enemies, as, required, by, circumstances, such, as, sudden, raids, sweeps, and, ambushes, and, psychological, warfare, shivaji, was, contemptuously, called, a, mountain, rat, by, aurangzeb, and, his, generals, because, of, his, guerilla, tactics, of, attacking, enemy, forces, and, then, retreating, into, his, mountain, forts, shivaji, demonstrated, great, skill, in, creating, his, military, organisation, which, lasted, until, the, demise, of, the, maratha, empire, his, strategy, rested, on, leveraging, his, ground, forces, naval, forces, and, series, of, forts, across, his, territory, the, maval, infantry, served, as, the, core, of, his, ground, forces, reinforced, by, telangi, musketeers, from, karnataka, and, supported, by, maratha, cavalry, his, artillery, was, relatively, underdeveloped, and, reliant, on, european, suppliers, further, inclining, him, to, a, very, mobile, form, of, warfare, hill, forts, played, a, key, role, in, shivaji, s, strategy, ramchandra, amatya, one, of, shivaji, s, ministers, describes, the, achievement, of, shivaji, by, saying, that, his, empire, was, created, from, forts, shivaji, captured, important, adilshahi, forts, at, murambdev, rajgad, torna, kondhana, sinhagad, and, purandar, he, also, rebuilt, or, repaired, many, forts, in, advantageous, locations, in, addition, shivaji, built, a, number, of, forts, numbering, 111, according, to, some, accounts, but, it, is, likely, the, actual, number, did, not, exceed, 18, the, historian, jadunath, sarkar, assessed, that, shivaji, owned, some, 240, 280, forts, at, the, time, of, his, death, each, was, placed, under, three, officers, of, equal, status, lest, a, single, traitor, be, bribed, or, tempted, to, deliver, it, to, the, enemy, the, officers, acted, jointly, and, provided, mutual, checks, and, balances, aware, of, the, need, for, naval, power, to, maintain, control, along, the, konkan, coast, shivaji, began, to, build, his, navy, in, 1657, or, 1659, with, the, purchase, of, twenty, galivats, from, the, portuguese, shipyards, of, bassein, marathi, chronicles, state, that, at, its, height, his, fleet, counted, some, 400, warships, although, contemporary, english, chronicles, counter, that, the, number, never, exceeded, 160, with, the, marathas, being, accustomed, to, a, land, based, military, shivaji, widened, his, search, for, qualified, crews, for, his, ships, taking, on, lower, caste, hindus, of, the, coast, who, were, long, familiar, with, naval, operations, the, famed, malabar, pirates, as, well, as, muslim, mercenaries, noting, the, power, of, the, portuguese, navy, shivaji, hired, a, number, of, portuguese, sailors, and, goan, christian, converts, and, made, rui, leitao, viegas, commander, of, his, fleet, viegas, was, later, to, defect, back, to, the, portuguese, taking, 300, sailors, with, him, shivaji, fortified, his, coastline, by, seizing, coastal, forts, and, refurbishing, them, he, built, his, first, marine, fort, at, sindhudurg, which, was, to, become, the, headquarters, of, the, maratha, navy, the, navy, itself, was, a, coastal, navy, focused, on, travel, and, combat, in, the, littoral, areas, and, not, intended, for, the, high, seas, shivaji, was, well, known, for, his, strong, religious, convictions, warrior, code, of, ethics, and, exemplary, character, shivaji, was, admired, for, his, heroic, exploits, and, clever, stratagems, in, the, contemporary, accounts, of, english, french, dutch, portuguese, and, italian, writers, contemporary, english, writers, compared, him, with, alexander, hannibal, and, julius, caesar, the, french, traveller, francois, bernier, wrote, in, his, travels, in, mughal, india, i, forgot, to, mention, that, during, pillage, of, sourate, seva, gy, the, holy, seva, gi, respected, the, habitation, of, the, reverend, father, ambrose, the, capuchin, missionary, the, frankish, padres, are, good, men, he, said, and, shall, not, be, attacked, he, spared, also, the, house, of, a, deceased, delale, or, gentile, broker, of, the, dutch, because, assured, that, he, had, been, very, charitable, while, alive, mughal, depictions, of, shivaji, were, largely, negative, referring, to, him, simply, as, shiva, without, the, honorific, ji, one, mughal, writer, in, the, early, 1700s, described, shivaji, s, death, as, kafir, bi, jahannum, raft, lit, the, infidel, went, to, hell, his, chivalrous, treatment, of, enemies, and, women, has, been, praised, by, mughal, authors, including, khafi, khan, jadunath, sarkar, writes, his, chivalry, to, women, and, strict, enforcement, of, morality, in, his, camp, was, a, wonder, in, that, age, and, has, extorted, the, admiration, of, hostile, critics, like, khafi, khan, the, earliest, depictions, of, shivaji, by, authors, not, affiliated, with, maratha, court, in, maharashtra, are, to, be, found, in, the, bakhars, that, depict, shivaji, as, an, almost, divine, figure, an, ideal, hindu, king, who, overthrew, muslim, dominion, the, current, academic, consensus, is, that, while, these, bakhars, are, important, for, understanding, how, shivaji, was, viewed, in, his, time, they, must, be, correlated, with, other, sources, to, decide, historical, truth, sabhasad, bakhar, and, 91, kalami, bakhar, are, considered, the, most, reliable, of, all, bakhars, by, scholars, james, grant, duff, a, british, administrator, published, his, 3, volume, work, on, history, of, marathas, in, 1863, this, work, is, mostly, a, chronological, sequence, of, events, and, more, of, a, political, history, with, little, to, no, insight, about, other, aspects, of, maharashtra, s, history, in, the, mid, 19th, century, marathi, social, reformer, jyotirao, phule, wrote, his,

brahmin, dominated, media, in, 1895, the, indian, nationalist, leader, lokmanya, tilak, organised, what, was, to, be, an, annual, festival, to, mark, the, birthday, of, shivaji, he, portrayed,
