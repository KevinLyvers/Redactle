ernst, waldfried, josef, wenzel, mach, m, x, mahkh, german, 18, february, 1838, 19, february, 1916, was, an, austrian, physicist, and, philosopher, who, contributed, to, the, physics, of, shock, waves, the, ratio, of, the, speed, of, a, flow, or, object, to, that, of, sound, is, named, the, mach, number, in, his, honour, as, a, philosopher, of, science, he, was, a, major, influence, on, logical, positivism, and, american, pragmatism, through, his, criticism, of, isaac, newton, s, theories, of, space, and, time, he, foreshadowed, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, mach, was, born, in, chrlice, german, chirlitz, moravia, austrian, empire, part, of, brno, in, the, czech, republic, his, father, who, had, graduated, from, charles, ferdinand, university, in, prague, acted, as, tutor, to, the, noble, brethon, family, in, zl, n, in, eastern, moravia, his, grandfather, wenzl, lanhaus, an, administrator, of, the, chirlitz, estate, was, also, master, builder, of, the, streets, there, his, activities, in, that, field, later, influenced, ernst, mach, s, theoretical, work, some, sources, give, mach, s, birthplace, as, tu, any, german, turas, also, part, of, brno, the, site, of, the, chirlitz, registry, office, it, was, there, that, mach, was, baptised, by, peregrin, weiss, mach, later, became, a, socialist, and, an, atheist, but, his, theory, and, life, was, sometimes, compared, to, buddhism, heinrich, gomperz, called, mach, the, buddha, of, science, because, of, his, phenomenalist, approach, to, the, ego, in, his, analysis, of, sensations, up, to, the, age, of, 14, mach, was, educated, at, home, by, his, parents, he, then, entered, a, gymnasium, in, krom, german, kremsier, where, he, studied, for, three, years, in, 1855, he, became, a, student, at, the, university, of, vienna, where, he, studied, physics, and, for, one, semester, medical, physiology, receiving, his, doctorate, in, physics, in, 1860, under, andreas, von, ettingshausen, with, the, thesis, ber, elektrische, ladungen, und, induktion, and, his, habilitation, the, following, year, his, early, work, focused, on, the, doppler, effect, in, optics, and, acoustics, in, 1864, he, took, a, job, as, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, university, of, graz, after, he, had, turned, down, the, position, of, a, chair, in, surgery, at, the, university, of, salzburg, to, do, so, and, in, 1866, he, was, appointed, professor, of, physics, during, that, period, mach, continued, his, work, in, psycho, physics, and, in, sensory, perception, in, 1867, he, took, the, chair, of, experimental, physics, at, the, charles, ferdinand, university, where, he, stayed, for, 28, years, before, returning, to, vienna, mach, s, main, contribution, to, physics, involved, his, description, and, photographs, of, spark, shock, waves, and, then, ballistic, shock, waves, he, described, how, when, a, bullet, or, shell, moved, faster, than, the, speed, of, sound, it, created, a, compression, of, air, in, front, of, it, using, schlieren, photography, he, and, his, son, ludwig, photographed, the, shadows, of, the, invisible, shock, waves, during, the, early, 1890s, ludwig, invented, a, modification, of, the, jamin, interferometer, that, allowed, for, much, clearer, photographs, but, mach, also, made, many, contributions, to, psychology, and, physiology, including, his, anticipation, of, gestalt, phenomena, his, discovery, of, the, oblique, effect, and, of, mach, bands, an, inhibition, influenced, type, of, visual, illusion, and, especially, his, discovery, of, a, non, acoustic, function, of, the, inner, ear, that, helps, control, human, balance, one, of, the, best, known, of, mach, s, ideas, is, the, so, called, mach, principle, the, physical, origin, of, inertia, this, was, never, written, down, by, mach, but, was, given, a, graphic, verbal, form, attributed, by, philipp, frank, to, mach, when, the, subway, jerks, it, s, the, fixed, stars, that, throw, you, down, mach, also, became, well, known, for, his, philosophy, developed, in, close, interplay, with, his, science, mach, defended, a, type, of, phenomenalism, recognizing, only, sensations, as, real, that, position, seemed, incompatible, with, the, view, of, atoms, and, molecules, as, external, mind, independent, things, he, famously, declared, after, an, 1897, lecture, by, ludwig, boltzmann, at, the, imperial, academy, of, science, in, vienna, i, don, t, believe, that, atoms, exist, from, about, 1908, to, 1911, max, planck, criticised, mach, s, reluctance, to, acknowledge, the, reality, of, atoms, as, incompatible, with, physics, einstein, s, 1905, work, on, brownian, motion, showed, that, the, statistical, fluctuations, of, atoms, allowed, measurement, of, their, existence, without, direct, individuated, sensory, evidence, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, acceptance, of, atomic, theory, some, of, mach, s, criticisms, of, newton, s, position, on, space, and, time, influenced, einstein, but, later, einstein, realised, that, mach, was, basically, opposed, to, newton, s, philosophy, and, concluded, that, his, physical, criticism, was, not, sound, in, 1898, mach, survived, a, paralytic, stroke, and, in, 1901, he, retired, from, the, university, of, vienna, and, was, appointed, to, the, upper, chamber, of, the, austrian, parliament, on, leaving, vienna, in, 1913, he, moved, to, his, son, s, home, in, vaterstetten, near, munich, where, he, continued, writing, and, corresponding, until, his, death, in, 1916, one, day, after, his, 78th, birthday, in, 1901, mach, accepted, an, appointment, to, the, austrian, house, of, lords, but, declined, a, nobility, because, he, thought, it, inappropriate, for, a, scientist, to, accept, such, a, thing, he, was, on, good, personal, terms, with, the, social, democrat, politician, viktor, adler, and, left, money, in, his, will, to, the, social, democrat, newspaper, arbeiter, zeitung, mach, was, critical, of, the, european, powers, colonial, conquests, saying, that, they, will, constitute, the, most, distasteful, chapter, of, history, for, coming, generations, most, of, mach, s, initial, studies, in, experimental, physics, concentrated, on, the, interference, diffraction, polarization, and, refraction, of, light, in, different, media, under, external, influences, from, there, followed, explorations, in, supersonic, fluid, mechanics, mach, and, physicist, photographer, peter, salcher, presented, their, paper, on, this, subject, in, 1887, it, correctly, describes, the, sound, effects, observed, during, the, supersonic, motion, of, a, projectile, they, deduced, and, experimentally, confirmed, the, existence, of, a, shock, wave, of, conical, shape, with, the, projectile, at, the, apex, the, ratio, of, the, speed, of, a, fluid, to, the, local, speed, of, sound, v, p, v, s, is, called, the, mach, number, after, him, it, is, a, critical, parameter, in, the, description, of, high, speed, fluid, movement, in, aerodynamics, and, hydrodynamics, mach, also, contributed, to, cosmology, the, hypothesis, known, as, mach, s, principle, from, 1895, to, 1901, mach, held, a, newly, created, chair, for, the, history, and, philosophy, of, the, inductive, sciences, at, the, university, of, vienna, in, his, historico, philosophical, studies, mach, developed, a, phenomenalistic, philosophy, of, science, that, became, influential, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, he, originally, saw, scientific, laws, as, summaries, of, experimental, events, constructed, for, the, purpose, of, making, complex, data, comprehensible, but, later, emphasized, mathematical, functions, as, a, more, useful, way, to, describe, sensory, appearances, thus, scientific, laws, while, somewhat, idealized, have, more, to, do, with, describing, sensations, than, with, reality, as, it, exists, beyond, sensations, the, goal, which, it, physical, science, has, set, itself, is, the, simplest, and, most, economical, abstract, expression, of, facts, when, the, human, mind, with, its, limited, powers, attempts, to, mirror, in, itself, the, rich, life, of, the, world, of, which, it, itself, is, only, a, small, part, and, which, it, can, never, hope, to, exhaust, it, has, every, reason, for, proceeding, economically, in, reality, the, law, always, contains, less, than, the, fact, itself, because, it, does, not, reproduce, the, fact, as, a, whole, but, only, in, that, aspect, of, it, which, is, important, for, us, the, rest, being, intentionally, or, from, necessity, omitted, in, mentally, separating, a, body, from, the, changeable, environment, in, which, it, moves, what, we, really, do, is, to, extricate, a, group, of, sensations, on, which, our, thoughts, are, fastened, and, which, is, of, relatively, greater, stability, than, the, others, from, the, stream, of, all, our, sensations, suppose, we, were, to, attribute, to, nature, the, property, of, producing, like, effects, in, like, circumstances, just, these, like, circumstances, we, should, not, know, how, to, find, nature, exists, once, only, our, schematic, mental, imitation, alone, produces, like, events, mach, s, positivism, influenced, many, russian, marxists, such, as, alexander, bogdanov, in, 1908, lenin, wrote, a, philosophical, work, materialism, and, empirio, criticism, in, which, he, criticized, machism, and, the, views, of, russian, machists, his, main, criticisms, were, that, mach, s, philosophy, led, to, solipsism, and, to, the, absurd, conclusion, that, nature, did, not, exist, before, humans, if, bodies, are, complexes, of, sensations, as, mach, says, or, combinations, of, sensations, as, berkeley, said, it, inevitably, follows, that, the, whole, world, is, but, my, idea, starting, from, such, a, premise, it, is, impossible, to, arrive, at, the, existence, of, other, people, besides, oneself, it, is, the, purest, solipsism, if, does, not, admit, that, the, sensible, content, is, an, objective, reality, existing, independently, of, us, there, remains, only, a, naked, abstract, i, an, i, infallibly, written, with, a, capital, letter, and, italicised, equal, to, the, insane, piano, which, imagined, that, it, was, the, sole, existing, thing, in, this, world, if, the, sensible, content, of, our, sensations, is, not, the, external, world, then, nothing, exists, save, this, naked, i, engaged, in, empty, philosophical, acrobatics, empirio, criticism, is, the, term, for, the, rigorously, positivist, and, radically, empiricist, philosophy, established, by, the, german, philosopher, richard, avenarius, and, further, developed, by, mach, joseph, petzoldt, and, others, that, claims, that, all, we, can, know, is, our, sensations, and, that, knowledge, should, be, confined, to, pure, experience, in, accordance, with, empirio, critical, philosophy, mach, opposed, boltzmann, and, others, who, proposed, an, atomic, theory, of, physics, since, one, cannot, observe, things, as, small, as, atoms, directly, and, since, no, atomic, model, at, the, time, was, consistent, the, atomic, hypothesis, seemed, unwarranted, to, mach, and, perhaps, not, sufficiently, economical, mach, had, a, direct, influence, on, the, vienna, circle, philosophers, and, logical, positivism, in, general, several, principles, are, attributed, to, mach, that, distill, his, ideal, of, physical, theorization, called, machian, physics, the, last, is, singled, out, particularly, by, einstein, as, the, mach, s, principle, einstein, cited, it, as, one, of, the, three, principles, underlying, general, relativity, in, 1930, he, wrote, it, is, justified, to, consider, mach, as, the, precursor, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, though, mach, before, his, death, apparently, rejected, einstein, s, theory, einstein, knew, that, his, theories, did, not, fulfill, all, mach, s, principles, and, neither, has, any, subsequent, theory, despite, considerable, effort, according, to, alexander, riegler, mach, s, work, was, a, precursor, to, the, influential, perspective, known, as, constructivism, constructivism, holds, that, all, knowledge, is, constructed, rather, than, received, by, the, learner, he, took, an, exceptionally, non, dualist, phenomenological, position, the, founder, of, radical, constructivism, ernst, von, glasersfeld, gave, a, nod, to, mach, as, an, ally, on, the, other, hand, there, is, also, a, reasonable, case, for, viewing, mach, simply, as, an, empiricist, and, a, precursor, of, the, logical, empiricists, and, the, vienna, circle, on, this, view, the, purpose, of, science, is, to, detail, functional, relationships, between, observations, the, goal, which, it, physical, science, has, set, itself, is, the, simplest, and, most, economical, abstract, expression, of, facts, friedrich, hayek, wrote, that, when, he, attended, the, university, of, vienna, from, 1918, to, 1921, as, far, as, philosophical, discussion, went, it, essentially, revolved, around, mach, s, ideas, mach, s, work, has, also, been, cited, as, an, influence, on, the, vienna, circle, in, 1873, independently, of, each, other, mach, and, the, physiologist, and, physician, josef, breuer, discovered, how, the, sense, of, balance, i, e, the, perception, of, the, head, s, imbalance, functions, tracing, its, management, by, information, the, brain, receives, from, the, movement, of, a, fluid, in, the, semicircular, canals, of, the, inner, ear, that, the, sense, of, balance, depends, on, the, three, semicircular, canals, was, discovered, in, 1870, by, the, physiologist, friedrich, goltz, but, goltz, did, not, discover, how, the, balance, sensing, apparatus, functions, mach, devised, a, swivel, chair, to, test, his, theories, and, floyd, ratliff, has, suggested, that, this, experiment, may, have, paved, the, way, to, mach, s, critique, of, a, physical, conception, of, absolute, space, and, motion, in, the, area, of, sensory, perception, psychologists, remember, mach, for, the, optical, illusion, called, mach, bands, the, effect, exaggerates, the, contrast, between, edges, of, the, slightly, differing, shades, of, gray, as, soon, as, they, touch, by, triggering, edge, detection, in, the, human, visual, system, more, clearly, than, anyone, before, or, since, mach, made, the, distinction, between, what, he, called, physiological, specifically, visual, and, geometrical, spaces, mach, s, views, on, mediating, structures, inspired, b, f, skinner, s, strongly, inductive, position, which, paralleled, mach, s, in, the, field, of, psychology, in, homage, his, name, was, given, to, mach, s, principal, works, in, english
