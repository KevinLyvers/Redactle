john, duns, scotus, ofm, s, k, o, t, s, skoh, t, s, ecclesiastical, latin, duns, the, scot, c, 1265, 66, 8, november, 1308, was, a, scottish, catholic, priest, and, franciscan, friar, university, professor, philosopher, and, theologian, he, is, one, of, the, four, most, important, christian, philosopher, theologians, of, western, europe, in, the, high, middle, ages, together, with, thomas, aquinas, bonaventure, and, william, of, ockham, duns, scotus, has, had, considerable, influence, on, both, catholic, and, secular, thought, the, doctrines, for, which, he, is, best, known, are, the, univocity, of, being, that, existence, is, the, most, abstract, concept, we, have, applicable, to, everything, that, exists, the, formal, distinction, a, way, of, distinguishing, between, different, formalities, of, the, same, thing, and, the, idea, of, haecceity, the, property, supposed, to, be, in, each, individual, thing, that, makes, it, an, individual, i, e, a, certain, thisness, duns, scotus, also, developed, a, complex, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, and, argued, for, the, immaculate, conception, of, mary, the, intellectual, tradition, derived, from, scotus, work, is, called, scotism, duns, scotus, was, given, the, scholastic, accolade, doctor, subtilis, the, subtle, doctor, for, his, penetrating, and, subtle, manner, of, thought, he, was, beatified, by, pope, john, paul, ii, in, 1993, critics, of, scotus, work, described, his, followers, as, dunces, the, dunce, cap, was, later, used, as, a, form, of, punishment, in, schools, and, the, word, dunce, has, come, to, be, used, as, a, term, to, describe, someone, dull, witted, little, is, known, of, duns, scotus, apart, from, his, work, his, date, of, birth, is, believed, to, have, been, sometime, between, 23, december, 1265, and, 17, march, 1266, he, was, born, into, a, leading, family, of, the, region, the, reputed, site, of, his, birth, in, front, of, the, pavilion, lodge, near, the, north, lodge, of, duns, castle, in, scotland, is, now, marked, by, a, cairn, which, was, erected, in, 1966, by, the, franciscan, friars, of, the, united, kingdom, to, mark, the, 700th, anniversary, of, his, birth, duns, scotus, received, the, religious, habit, of, the, order, of, friars, minor, at, dumfries, where, his, uncle, elias, duns, was, guardian, duns, scotus, s, age, is, based, on, the, first, certain, date, for, his, life, that, of, his, ordination, to, the, priesthood, at, st, andrew, s, northampton, england, on, 17, march, 1291, the, minimum, canonical, age, for, receiving, holy, orders, is, 25, and, it, is, generally, assumed, that, he, would, have, been, ordained, as, soon, as, it, was, permitted, that, his, contemporaries, called, him, johannes, duns, after, the, medieval, practice, of, calling, people, by, their, christian, name, followed, by, their, place, of, origin, suggests, that, he, came, from, duns, in, berwickshire, scotland, according, to, tradition, duns, scotus, was, educated, at, a, franciscan, studium, generale, a, medieval, university, a, house, behind, st, ebbe, s, church, oxford, in, a, triangular, area, enclosed, by, pennyfarthing, street, and, running, from, st, aldate, s, to, the, castle, the, bailey, and, the, old, wall, where, the, friars, minor, had, moved, when, the, university, of, paris, was, dispersed, in, 1229, 30, at, that, time, there, would, have, been, about, 270, people, living, there, of, whom, about, 80, would, have, been, friars, duns, scotus, appears, to, have, been, in, oxford, by, 1300, as, he, is, listed, among, a, group, of, friars, for, whom, the, provincial, superior, of, the, english, ecclesiastical, province, which, included, scotland, requested, faculties, from, the, bishop, of, lincoln, for, the, hearing, of, confessions, he, took, part, in, a, disputation, under, the, regent, master, philip, of, bridlington, in, 1300, 01, he, began, lecturing, on, peter, lombard, s, sentences, at, the, prestigious, university, of, paris, towards, the, end, of, 1302, later, in, that, academic, year, however, he, was, expelled, from, the, university, of, paris, for, siding, with, pope, boniface, viii, in, his, feud, with, king, philip, iv, of, france, over, the, taxation, of, church, property, duns, scotus, was, back, in, paris, before, the, end, of, 1304, probably, returning, in, may, he, continued, lecturing, there, until, for, reasons, that, are, still, mysterious, he, was, dispatched, to, the, franciscan, studium, at, cologne, probably, in, october, 1307, according, to, the, 15th, century, writer, william, vorilong, his, departure, was, sudden, and, unexpected, he, was, relaxing, or, talking, with, students, in, the, prato, clericorum, or, pr, aux, clercs, an, open, area, of, the, rive, gauche, used, by, scholars, for, recreation, when, orders, arrived, from, the, franciscan, minister, general, scotus, left, immediately, taking, few, or, no, personal, belongings, duns, scotus, died, unexpectedly, in, cologne, in, november, 1308, the, date, of, his, death, is, traditionally, given, as, 8, november, he, is, buried, in, the, church, of, the, friars, minor, there, his, sarcophagus, bears, the, latin, poem, the, story, about, duns, scotus, being, buried, alive, in, the, absence, of, his, servant, who, alone, knew, of, his, susceptibility, to, coma, is, probably, a, myth, the, first, known, attestation, of, this, theme, dates, from, around, 1400, among, many, authors, francis, bacon, reported, it, in, his, historia, vitae, et, mortis, the, colophon, of, codex, 66, of, merton, college, oxford, says, that, scotus, was, also, at, cambridge, scotus, s, great, work, is, his, commentary, on, the, sentences, of, peter, lombard, which, contains, nearly, all, the, philosophical, views, and, arguments, for, which, he, is, well, known, including, the, univocity, of, being, the, formal, distinction, less, than, numerical, unity, individual, nature, or, thisness, haecceity, his, critique, of, illuminationism, and, his, renowned, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, his, commentary, exists, in, several, versions, the, standard, version, is, the, ordinatio, also, known, as, the, opus, oxoniense, a, revised, version, of, lectures, he, gave, as, a, bachelor, at, oxford, the, initial, revision, was, probably, begun, in, the, summer, of, 1300, see, the, remarks, in, the, prologue, question, 2, alluding, to, the, battle, of, wadi, al, khazandar, in, 1299, news, of, which, probably, reached, oxford, in, the, summer, of, 1300, it, was, still, incomplete, when, scotus, left, for, paris, in, 1302, the, two, other, versions, of, the, work, are, scotus, s, notes, for, the, oxford, lectures, recently, transcribed, and, published, as, the, lectura, the, first, book, of, which, was, probably, written, in, oxford, in, the, late, 1290s, and, the, reportatio, parisiensis, or, opus, parisiense, consisting, of, transcriptions, of, the, lectures, on, the, sentences, given, by, scotus, when, he, was, in, paris, a, reportatio, is, a, student, report, or, transcription, of, the, original, lecture, of, a, master, a, version, that, has, been, checked, by, the, master, himself, is, known, as, a, reportatio, examinata, by, the, time, of, scotus, these, commentaries, on, the, sentences, were, no, longer, literal, commentaries, instead, peter, lombard, s, original, text, was, used, as, a, starting, point, for, highly, original, discussions, on, topics, of, theological, or, philosophical, interest, for, example, book, ii, distinction, 2, about, the, location, of, angels, is, a, starting, point, for, a, complex, discussion, about, continuous, motion, and, whether, the, same, thing, can, be, in, two, different, places, at, the, same, time, bilocation, in, the, same, book, distinction, 3, he, uses, the, question, of, how, angels, can, be, different, from, one, another, given, that, they, have, no, material, bodies, to, investigate, the, difficult, question, of, individuation, in, general, scotus, wrote, purely, philosophical, and, logical, works, at, an, early, stage, of, his, career, consisting, of, commentaries, on, aristotle, s, organon, these, are, the, questions, on, porphyry, s, isagoge, and, aristotle, s, categories, peri, hermeneias, and, de, sophisticis, elenchis, probably, dating, to, around, 1295, his, commentary, on, aristotle, s, metaphysics, was, probably, written, in, stages, the, first, version, having, started, around, 1297, with, significant, additions, and, amendments, possibly, after, the, completion, of, the, main, body, of, the, ordinatio, his, expositio, on, the, metaphysics, was, lost, for, centuries, but, was, recently, rediscovered, and, edited, by, giorgio, pini, in, addition, there, are, 46, short, disputations, called, collationes, probably, dating, from, 1300, to, 1305, a, work, in, natural, theology, de, primo, principio, and, his, quaestiones, quodlibetales, a, record, of, a, quodlibetal, disputation, probably, dating, to, advent, 1306, or, lent, 1307, a, number, of, works, once, believed, to, have, been, written, by, scotus, are, now, known, to, have, been, misattributed, there, were, already, concerns, about, this, within, two, centuries, of, his, death, when, the, 16th, century, logician, jacobus, naveros, noted, inconsistencies, between, these, texts, and, his, commentary, on, the, sentences, leading, him, to, doubt, whether, he, had, written, any, logical, works, at, all, the, questions, on, the, prior, analytics, in, librum, priorum, analyticorum, aristotelis, quaestiones, were, also, discovered, to, be, mistakenly, attributed, in, 1922, grabmann, showed, that, the, logical, work, de, modis, significandi, was, actually, by, thomas, of, erfurt, a, 14th, century, logician, of, the, modist, school, thus, the, claim, that, martin, heidegger, wrote, his, habilitation, thesis, on, scotus, is, only, half, true, as, the, second, part, is, actually, based, on, the, work, by, erfurt, scotus, view, of, universals, is, known, as, scotistic, realism, scotus, is, generally, considered, to, be, a, realist, as, opposed, to, a, nominalist, in, that, he, treated, universals, as, real, but, he, held, that, they, exist, both, in, particular, things, and, as, concepts, in, the, mind, as, opposed, to, a, platonic, third, realm, he, attacks, a, position, close, to, that, later, defended, by, ockham, arguing, that, things, have, a, common, nature, for, example, the, humanity, common, to, socrates, plato, and, plutarch, he, followed, aristotle, in, asserting, that, the, subject, matter, of, metaphysics, is, being, qua, being, ens, inquantum, ens, being, in, general, ens, in, communi, as, a, univocal, notion, was, for, him, the, first, object, of, the, intellect, the, doctrine, of, the, univocity, of, being, implies, the, denial, of, any, real, distinction, between, essence, and, existence, aquinas, had, argued, that, in, all, finite, being, i, e, all, except, god, the, essence, of, a, thing, is, distinct, from, its, existence, scotus, rejected, the, distinction, scotus, argued, that, we, cannot, conceive, of, what, it, is, to, be, something, without, conceiving, it, as, existing, we, should, not, make, any, distinction, between, whether, a, thing, exists, si, est, and, what, it, is, quid, est, for, we, never, know, whether, something, exists, unless, we, have, some, concept, of, what, we, know, to, exist, scotus, elaborates, a, distinct, view, on, hylomorphism, with, three, important, strong, theses, that, differentiate, him, he, held, 1, that, there, exists, matter, that, has, no, form, whatsoever, or, prime, matter, as, the, stuff, underlying, all, change, against, aquinas, cf, his, quaestiones, in, metaphysicam, 7, q, 5, lectura, 2, d, 12, q, un, 2, that, not, all, created, substances, are, composites, of, form, and, matter, cf, lectura, 2, d, 12, q, un, n, 55, that, is, that, purely, spiritual, substances, do, exist, and, 3, that, one, and, the, same, substance, can, have, more, than, one, substantial, form, for, instance, humans, have, at, least, two, substantial, forms, the, soul, and, the, form, of, the, body, forma, corporeitas, cf, ordinatio, 4, d, 11, q, 3, n, 54, he, argued, for, an, original, principle, of, individuation, cf, ordinatio, 2, d, 3, pars, 1, qq, 1, 6, the, haecceity, as, the, ultimate, unity, of, a, unique, individual, haecceitas, an, entity, s, thisness, as, opposed, to, the, common, nature, natura, communis, feature, existing, in, any, number, of, individuals, for, scotus, the, axiom, stating, that, only, the, individual, exists, is, a, dominating, principle, of, the, understanding, of, reality, for, the, apprehension, of, individuals, an, intuitive, cognition, is, required, which, gives, us, the, present, existence, or, the, non, existence, of, an, individual, as, opposed, to, abstract, cognition, thus, the, human, soul, in, its, separated, state, from, the, body, will, be, capable, of, knowing, the, spiritual, intuitively, like, other, realist, philosophers, of, the, period, such, as, aquinas, and, henry, of, ghent, scotus, recognised, the, need, for, an, intermediate, distinction, that, was, not, merely, conceptual, but, not, fully, real, or, mind, dependent, either, scotus, argued, for, a, formal, distinction, distinctio, formalis, a, parte, rei, which, holds, between, entities, which, are, inseparable, and, indistinct, in, reality, but, whose, definitions, are, not, identical, for, example, the, personal, properties, of, the, trinity, are, formally, distinct, from, the, divine, essence, similarly, the, distinction, between, the, thisness, or, haecceity, of, a, thing, is, intermediate, between, a, real, and, a, conceptual, distinction, there, is, also, a, formal, distinction, between, the, divine, attributes, and, the, powers, of, the, soul, scotus, was, an, augustinian, franciscan, theologian, he, is, usually, associated, with, theological, voluntarism, the, tendency, to, emphasize, god, s, will, and, human, freedom, in, all, philosophical, issues, the, main, difference, between, aquinas, s, rational, theology, and, that, of, scotus, is, that, scotus, believed, certain, predicates, may, be, applied, univocally, with, exactly, the, same, meaning, to, god, and, creatures, whereas, aquinas, insisted, that, this, is, impossible, and, that, only, analogical, predication, can, be, employed, in, which, a, word, as, applied, to, god, has, a, meaning, different, from, although, related, to, the, meaning, of, that, same, word, as, applied, to, creatures, duns, struggled, throughout, his, works, in, demonstrating, his, univocity, theory, against, aquinas, s, analogy, doctrine, scotus, gave, the, lecture, lectura, i, 39, during, 1297, 1299, to, refute, the, view, that, everything, is, necessary, and, immutable, he, claims, that, the, aim, of, this, lecture, has, two, points, lectura, i, 39, 31, first, to, consider, the, contingency, in, what, is, de, contingentia, in, entibus, second, to, consider, how, god, s, certain, knowledge, is, compatible, with, the, contingency, of, things, scotus, tries, to, defend, the, validity, of, christian, theology, against, the, attack, of, ancient, philosophers, the, main, argument, is, unpacked, in, lectura, i, 39, 49, 53, scotus, argues, that, a, necessary, being, god, is, able, to, have, contingent, knowledge, and, that, although, this, knowledge, is, contingent, it, is, not, necessarily, mutable, and, temporal, by, that, very, fact, in, lectura, i, 39, 1, scotus, asks, whether, god, has, determinate, knowledge, of, things, according, to, every, aspect, of, their, existence, as, according, to, being, in, the, future, he, presents, a, counterview, which, claims, that, god, cannot, have, determinate, knowledge, of, the, future, to, support, this, counterview, he, uses, aristotle, s, de, interpretatione, ix, in, the, following, arguments, scotus, does, not, attempt, to, contradict, aristotle, he, does, not, affirm, or, reject, the, ideas, of, aristotle, the, only, issue, he, argues, against, is, the, proposition, that, god, cannot, have, determinate, knowledge, of, the, future, scotus, appears, to, try, to, fully, demonstrate, that, aristotle, s, text, is, not, contradictory, to, the, christian, doctrine, of, god, scotus, argues, that, god, wills, with, one, single, volition, unica, volitione, whatever, he, wills, god, has, one, volition, ad, intra, but, this, one, volition, can, be, related, to, many, opposite, things, ad, extra, god, can, simultaneously, will, one, thing, at, time, 1, and, the, opposite, thing, at, time, 2, there, are, various, possible, interpretations, of, aristotle, s, de, interpretatione, ix, for, example, john, buridan, ca, 1300, 1362, thought, the, scotistic, contingency, theory, was, an, aristotelian, view, buridan, s, judgment, is, all, the, more, possible, because, of, at, least, four, reasons, 1, aristotle, s, de, interpretatione, ix, 19a23, 25, can, be, interpreted, like, the, scotistic, contingency, theory, 2, scotus, himself, does, not, refute, aristotle, s, de, interpretatione, ix, in, lectura, i, 39, 49, 53, 3, scotus, rather, tries, to, formulate, his, contingency, theory, with, the, help, of, other, works, of, aristotle, in, lectura, i, 39, 51, 54, 4, scotus, introduces, the, diachronic, feature, of, god, s, volition, to, his, contingency, theory, as, well, as, the, synchronic, feature, duns, scotus, argued, that, it, is, better, to, construct, a, metaphysical, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, rather, than, the, more, common, physical, argument, from, motion, favoured, by, aquinas, following, aristotle, though, the, version, in, de, primo, principio, is, the, most, complete, and, final, version, the, ordinatio, proof, is, usually, offered, however, the, de, primo, version, is, fascinating, and, worth, looking, into, for, a, wider, understanding, of, the, argument, as, well, as, scotus, s, metaphysical, underpinnings, for, his, argument, for, god, s, existence, but, the, ordinatio, version, will, be, followed, here, briefly, scotus, begins, his, proof, by, explaining, that, there, are, two, angles, we, must, take, in, arguing, for, the, existence, of, an, actually, infinite, being, first, from, the, view, of, the, relative, properties, of, god, and, second, from, the, absolute, properties, of, god, relative, properties, are, those, which, are, predicable, of, god, in, relation, to, creation, absolute, properties, are, those, which, belong, to, god, whether, or, not, he, chose, to, create, under, the, first, heading, of, relative, properties, scotus, argues, for, a, triple, primacy, of, efficiency, finality, and, pre, eminence, from, there, he, shows, that, one, primacy, implies, the, others, and, finally, there, can, only, be, one, nature, that, is, the, first, efficient, cause, ultimate, end, and, the, most, perfect, nature, from, there, the, subtle, doctor, discusses, the, absolute, properties, of, god, the, first, being, is, intellectual, and, volitional, and, the, intellect, and, will, are, identical, with, the, essence, of, this, supreme, nature, the, first, being, is, also, infinite, being, while, discussing, the, infinity, of, god, scotus, resurrects, anselm, s, argument, and, responds, to, the, criticism, that, anselm, makes, an, illicit, leap, from, concept, to, reality, finally, he, gives, a, definite, answer, of, yes, to, the, question, of, whether, there, exists, an, actually, infinite, being, the, very, next, question, of, the, ordinatio, deals, with, the, unicity, of, the, nature, thus, proved, to, exist, however, the, de, primo, principio, version, concludes, with, this, argument, the, proof, for, the, conclusion, that, some, efficient, cause, is, simply, first, such, that, neither, can, it, be, an, effect, nor, can, it, by, virtue, of, something, other, than, itself, cause, an, effect, ordinatio, i, 2, 43, runs, like, this, scotus, acknowledges, two, objections, and, deals, with, them, accordingly, first, is, that, he, begs, the, question, in, assuming, a, first, in, the, series, here, he, argues, that, while, many, admit, an, infinite, regress, in, an, accidentally, ordered, series, of, causes, no, philosopher, admits, infinite, regress, in, an, essentially, ordered, series, scotus, explains, the, differences, between, the, two, and, offers, proofs, for, the, conclusion, that, an, infinity, of, essentially, ordered, causes, in, a, series, is, impossible, second, it, is, objected, that, his, proof, is, not, really, a, demonstration, since, it, begins, with, a, contingent, premise, that, something, is, produced, is, contingent, and, not, necessary, therefore, the, proof, proceeds, from, a, contingent, and, not, a, necessary, premise, scotus, says, that, while, that, is, true, it, is, utterly, manifest, that, things, are, produced, or, effected, but, in, order, to, respond, scotus, makes, a, modal, move, and, reworks, the, argument, now, he, argues, from, the, possibility, of, production, it, is, possible, that, something, can, be, produced, is, a, necessary, proposition, from, there, he, is, able, to, conclude, that, it, is, possible, that, the, first, efficient, cause, exists, and, if, it, is, possible, that, it, exists, then, it, does, exist, he, asserts, that, the, last, claim, will, be, proved, later, in, the, argument, in, the, lectura, proof, scotus, argues, the, following, way, although, beings, different, from, god, are, actually, contingent, with, respect, to, their, factual, existence, nevertheless, they, are, not, with, respect, to, their, possible, existence, hence, those, entities, which, are, called, contingent, with, respect, to, their, factual, existence, are, necessary, with, respect, to, their, possible, existence, for, instance, although, there, exists, a, man, is, contingent, nevertheless, it, is, possible, that, he, exists, is, necessary, because, his, existence, does, not, include, any, contradiction, therefore, something, different, from, god, is, possible, is, necessary, because, being, is, divided, into, the, contingent, and, the, necessary, just, as, necessity, belongs, to, a, necessary, being, in, virtue, of, its, condition, or, its, quiddity, so, possibility, belongs, to, a, possible, being, in, virtue, of, its, quiddity, if, the, first, argument, is, alternatively, qualified, with, the, notion, of, ontological, possibility, then, we, have, necessary, propositions, as, follows, it, is, possible, that, there, is, something, different, from, god, it, is, not, of, itself, because, then, it, would, not, be, the, case, that, it, were, possible, nor, from, nothing, therefore, it, is, possible, that, it, is, from, something, else, either, it, is, possible, that, the, other, agent, acts, by, virtue, of, itself, and, not, by, virtue, of, something, else, not, being, from, something, else, or, it, is, not, possible, if, so, then, it, is, possible, that, there, is, a, first, agent, and, if, it, possible, that, it, exists, then, it, exists, just, as, we, have, proved, before, if, not, and, if, there, is, no, infinite, regress, then, the, argument, at, once, comes, to, a, standstill, for, more, on, this, argument, see, especially, authors, duns, scotus, ordinatio, ordinatio, i, d2, q2b, the, logic, museum, scotus, argued, against, the, version, of, illuminationism, that, had, been, defended, earlier, in, the, century, by, henry, of, ghent, in, his, ordinatio, i, 3, 1, 4, he, argued, against, the, sceptical, consequences, that, henry, claimed, would, follow, from, abandoning, divine, illumination, scotus, argued, that, if, our, thinking, were, fallible, in, the, way, henry, had, believed, such, illumination, could, not, even, in, principle, ensure, certain, and, pure, knowledge, perhaps, the, most, influential, point, of, duns, scotus, s, theology, was, his, defense, of, the, immaculate, conception, of, mary, i, e, that, mary, herself, was, conceived, without, sin, at, the, time, there, was, a, great, deal, of, argument, about, the, subject, the, general, opinion, was, that, it, was, appropriately, deferential, to, the, mother, of, god, but, it, could, not, be, seen, how, to, resolve, the, problem, that, only, with, christ, s, death, would, the, stain, of, original, sin, be, removed, the, great, philosophers, and, theologians, of, the, west, were, divided, on, the, subject, indeed, even, thomas, aquinas, sided, with, those, who, denied, the, doctrine, the, feast, day, had, existed, in, the, east, though, in, the, east, the, feast, is, just, of, the, conception, of, mary, since, the, seventh, century, and, had, been, introduced, in, several, dioceses, in, the, west, as, well, even, though, the, philosophical, basis, was, lacking, citing, anselm, of, canterbury, s, principle,

scotism, a, special, form, of, scholasticism, he, came, out, of, the, old, franciscan, school, to, which, haymo, of, faversham, died, 1244, alexander, of, hales, died, 1245, john, of, rupella, died,

becoming, used, for, somebody, who, is, incapable, of, scholarship, critics, of, scotus, work, described, his, followers, as, dunces, the, dunce, cap, was, used, as, a, form, of, punishment, in, schools, and, the, word, dunce, has, come, to, be, used, as, a, term, to, describe, someone, dull, witted, an, important, question, since, the, 1960s, has, revolved, over, whether, scotus, s, thought, heralded, a, change, in, thinking, on, the, nature, of, being, a, change, which, marked, a, shift, from, aquinas, and, other, previous, thinkers, this, question, has, been, particularly, significant, in, recent, years, because, it, has, come, to, be, seen, as, a, debate, over, the, origins, of, modernity, this, line, of, argument, first, emerged, in, the, 1960s, among, popular, french, philosophers, who, in, passing, singled, out, duns, scotus, as, the, figure, whose, theory, of, univocal, being, changed, an, earlier, approach, which, aquinas, had, shared, with, his, predecessors, then, in, 1990, the, historian, of, philosophy, jean, francois, courtine, argued, that, between, the, time, of, aquinas, in, the, mid, thirteenth, century, and, francisco, su, rez, at, the, turn, of, the, seventeenth, a, fundamentally, new, approach, to, being, was, developed, with, scotus, taking, a, major, part, in, its, development, during, the, 1990s, various, scholars, extended, this, argument, to, locate, scotus, as, the, first, thinker, who, succumbed, to, what, heidegger, termed, onto, theology, in, recent, years, this, criticism, of, scotus, has, become, disseminated, in, particular, through, the, writings, of, the, radical, orthodox, group, of, theologians, drawing, on, john, milbank, and, catherine, pickstock, the, radical, orthodox, model, has, been, questioned, by, daniel, horan, and, thomas, williams, both, of, whom, claim, that, scotus, s, doctrine, of, the, univocity, of, being, is, a, semantic, rather, than, an, ontological, theory, both, thinkers, cite,

be, interpreted, in, terms, of, the, ontological, diversity, of, those, things, to, which, the, concept, is, attributed, which, is, compatible, with, there, being, one, concept, that, can, be,
