puerto, rico, by, appointment, of, the, spanish, crown, in, 1509, while, ponce, de, le, n, grew, quite, wealthy, from, his, plantations, and, mines, he, faced, an, ongoing, legal, conflict, with, diego, col, n, the, late, christopher, columbus, s, son, over, the, right, to, govern, puerto, rico, after, a, long, court, battle, columbus, replaced, ponce, de, le, n, as, governor, in, 1511, ponce, de, le, n, decided, to, follow, the, advice, of, the, sympathetic, king, ferdinand, and, explore, more, of, the, caribbean, sea, in, 1513, ponce, de, le, n, led, the, first, known, european, expedition, to, la, florida, which, he, named, during, his, first, voyage, to, the, area, he, landed, somewhere, along, florida, s, east, coast, then, charted, the, atlantic, coast, down, to, the, florida, keys, and, north, along, the, gulf, coast, historian, john, r, swanton, believed, that, he, sailed, perhaps, as, far, as, apalachee, bay, on, florida, s, western, coast, though, in, popular, culture, he, was, supposedly, searching, for, the, fountain, of, youth, there, is, no, contemporary, evidence, to, support, the, story, which, most, modern, historians, consider, a, myth, ponce, de, le, n, returned, to, spain, in, 1514, and, was, knighted, by, king, ferdinand, who, also, reinstated, him, as, the, governor, of, puerto, rico, and, authorized, him, to, settle, florida, he, returned, to, the, caribbean, in, 1515, but, plans, to, organize, an, expedition, to, florida, were, delayed, by, the, death, of, king, ferdinand, in, 1516, after, which, ponce, de, le, n, again, traveled, to, spain, to, defend, his, grants, and, titles, he, did, not, return, to, puerto, rico, for, two, years, in, march, 1521, ponce, de, le, n, finally, returned, to, southwest, florida, with, the, first, large, scale, attempt, to, establish, a, spanish, colony, in, what, is, now, the, continental, united, states, however, the, native, calusa, people, fiercely, resisted, the, incursion, and, ponce, de, l, on, was, seriously, wounded, in, a, skirmish, the, colonization, attempt, was, abandoned, and, he, died, from, his, wounds, soon, after, returning, to, cuba, in, early, july, he, was, interred, in, puerto, rico, his, tomb, is, located, inside, the, cathedral, of, san, juan, bautista, in, san, juan, juan, ponce, de, le, n, was, born, in, the, village, of, santerv, s, de, campos, in, the, northern, part, of, what, is, now, the, spanish, province, of, valladolid, although, early, historians, placed, his, birth, in, 1460, and, this, date, has, been, used, traditionally, more, recent, evidence, shows, he, was, likely, born, in, 1474, the, surname, ponce, de, le, n, dates, from, the, 13th, century, the, ponce, de, le, n, lineage, began, with, ponce, v, laz, de, cabrera, descendant, of, count, bermudo, n, ez, and, sancha, ponce, de, cabrera, daughter, of, ponce, giraldo, de, cabrera, before, october, 1235, a, son, of, ponce, vela, de, cabrera, and, his, wife, teresa, rodr, guez, gir, n, named, pedro, ponce, de, cabrera, married, aldonza, alfonso, an, illegitimate, daughter, of, king, alfonso, ix, of, le, n, the, descendants, of, this, marriage, added, the, de, le, n, to, their, patronymic, and, were, known, thereafter, by, the, name, ponce, de, le, n, although, the, identity, of, juan, ponce, de, le, n, s, parents, is, still, a, matter, of, conjecture, according, to, fuson, and, arnade, citing, puerto, rican, historian, aurelio, ti, pedro, ponce, de, le, n, and, leonor, de, figueroa, were, most, likely, the, parents, of, juan, ponce, de, le, n, thus, ponce, appears, to, have, been, a, member, of, a, distinguished, and, influential, noble, family, his, relatives, included, rodrigo, ponce, de, le, n, duke, of, c, diz, a, celebrated, figure, in, the, moorish, wars, sometimes, known, as, a, new, cid, and, juan, ponce, de, le, n, s, first, cousin, aurelio, ti, in, his, nuevas, fuentes, para, la, historia, de, puerto, rico, made, a, vigorous, case, for, juan, ponce, s, aristocratic, heritage, determining, that, juan, ponce, s, father, was, pedro, ponce, de, le, n, the, fourth, lord, of, villagarc, a, and, his, mother, was, leonor, de, figueroa, the, daughter, of, lorenzo, su, rez, de, figueroa, lord, of, salvale, n, and, mar, a, manuel, consequently, juan, ponce, s, paternal, grandmother, teresa, de, guzm, n, teresa, ponce, de, le, n, y, guzm, n, was, la, se, ora, de, la, casa, toral, making, juan, ponce, a, ponce, de, le, n, on, both, sides, of, his, family, through, this, grandmother, ponce, de, le, n, was, related, to, another, notable, family, the, n, ez, de, guzm, ns, a, contemporary, chronicler, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, oviedo, y, vald, s, says, that, as, a, young, man, he, served, as, a, page, and, then, as, a, squire, to, pedro, n, ez, de, guzm, n, knight, commander, of, the, order, of, calatrava, devereux, says, ponce, de, le, n, probably, joined, the, spanish, campaigns, against, the, muslims, in, the, granada, war, in, which, the, catholic, monarchs, finally, conquered, in, 1492, the, nasrid, kingdom, of, granada, the, last, muslim, polity, surviving, in, the, iberian, peninsula, puerto, rican, historian, vicente, murga, sanz, states, that, as, the, squire, of, pedro, n, ez, de, guzm, n, it, is, possible, that, juan, ponce, de, le, n, fought, on, the, side, of, rodrigo, ponce, de, le, n, at, the, battle, of, granada, fernandez, de, oviedo, writes, that, when, juan, ponce, de, le, n, arrived, in, the, americas, he, was, a, military, man, who, had, gained, his, experience, in, the, granada, war, but, arnade, cautions, without, proof, the, biographers, of, the, conquistador, state, that, he, accompanied, pedro, n, ez, de, guzm, n, in, the, war, against, the, moors, during, the, granada, campaign, in, september, 1493, some, 1, 200, sailors, colonists, and, soldiers, joined, christopher, columbus, for, his, second, voyage, to, the, new, world, ponce, de, le, n, nineteen, years, old, was, able, to, get, passage, in, this, expedition, with, n, ez, de, guzm, n, s, help, as, one, of, 200, gentleman, volunteers, the, fleet, reached, the, caribbean, in, november, 1493, they, visited, several, islands, before, arriving, at, their, primary, destination, in, hispaniola, and, anchored, on, the, coast, of, a, large, island, the, native, people, called, borik, n, boriquen, in, spanish, the, land, of, the, brave, lord, which, would, eventually, become, known, as, puerto, rico, this, was, ponce, de, le, n, s, first, glimpse, of, the, place, that, would, play, a, major, role, in, his, future, historians, are, divided, on, what, he, did, during, the, next, several, years, but, it, is, possible, that, he, returned, to, spain, at, some, point, and, made, his, way, back, to, hispaniola, with, nicol, s, de, ovando, in, 1502, the, newly, appointed, governor, nicol, s, de, ovando, arrived, in, hispaniola, with, the, spanish, crown, expecting, him, to, bring, order, to, a, colony, in, disarray, a, task, in, which, he, succeeded, ovando, interpreted, his, instructions, as, authorizing, subjugation, of, the, native, ta, nos, and, consequently, authorized, the, jaragua, massacre, in, november, 1503, in, 1504, when, ta, nos, overran, a, small, spanish, garrison, in, hig, ey, on, the, island, s, eastern, side, ovando, assigned, ponce, de, le, n, to, crush, the, rebellion, ponce, de, le, n, was, actively, involved, in, the, hig, ey, massacre, about, which, friar, bartolom, de, las, casas, attempted, to, notify, spanish, authorities, ovando, rewarded, his, victorious, commander, by, appointing, him, frontier, governor, of, the, newly, conquered, province, then, named, hig, ey, also, ponce, de, le, n, received, a, substantial, land, grant, with, an, encomienda, of, sufficient, indian, labor, to, farm, his, new, estate, ponce, de, le, n, prospered, in, this, new, role, he, found, a, ready, market, for, his, farm, produce, and, livestock, at, nearby, boca, de, yuma, where, spanish, ships, stocked, supplies, before, the, long, voyage, back, to, spain, in, 1505, ovando, authorized, ponce, de, le, n, to, establish, a, new, town, in, hig, ey, which, he, named, salvale, n, in, 1508, king, ferdinand, queen, isabella, having, opposed, the, exploitation, of, natives, but, dying, in, 1504, authorized, ponce, de, le, n, to, conquer, the, remaining, ta, nos, and, exploit, them, by, forcing, them, to, mine, gold, around, this, time, ponce, de, le, n, married, leonora, an, innkeeper, s, daughter, they, had, three, daughters, juana, isabel, and, mar, a, and, one, son, luis, the, large, stone, house, ponce, de, le, n, ordered, built, for, his, growing, family, still, stands, today, near, the, city, of, san, rafael, del, yuma, he, named, it, salvale, n, after, his, grandmother, s, estate, in, castile, as, provincial, governor, ponce, de, le, n, heard, stories, from, island, caribs, who, had, been, captured, when, they, raided, spanish, colonies, they, told, him, of, gold, on, the, neighboring, island, of, san, juan, now, puerto, rico, which, he, had, first, seen, as, a, member, of, christopher, columbus, s, second, voyage, in, 1493, describing, a, fertile, land, with, much, gold, to, be, found, in, the, many, rivers, inspired, by, the, possibility, of, riches, ponce, de, le, n, requested, and, received, permission, from, ovando, to, explore, the, island, the, official, settlement, of, san, juan, by, spaniards, is, often, dated, to, 1508, when, ponce, landed, in, a, caravel, with, about, fifty, men, on, the, southern, coast, of, the, island, but, there, is, documentation, in, the, archive, of, the, indies, archivo, general, de, indias, that, he, had, led, an, expedition, there, with, several, hundred, men, as, early, as, 1506, under, orders, by, governor, ovando, to, explore, settle, and, conquer, the, island, puerto, rican, scholar, aurelio, ti, wrote, two, books, which, contain, much, archival, material, concerning, ponce, de, le, n, including, documentation, he, discovered, in, spain, and, in, puerto, rico, he, writes, in, detail, of, the, probanza, de, juan, gonz, lez, according, to, which, a, temporary, base, was, established, on, the, west, coast, of, puerto, rico, near, the, bay, of, a, asco, in, 1506, this, earlier, trip, was, said, to, have, been, done, quietly, because, the, spanish, crown, in, 1504, had, commissioned, vicente, y, ez, pinz, n, to, explore, the, island, and, build, a, fort, pinz, n, did, not, fulfill, his, commission, and, it, expired, in, 1507, leaving, the, way, clear, for, ponce, de, le, n, his, earlier, exploration, had, confirmed, the, presence, of, gold, and, gave, him, a, good, understanding, of, the, geography, of, the, island, in, 1508, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, gave, permission, to, ponce, de, le, n, for, the, first, official, expedition, to, the, island, which, the, spanish, then, called, san, juan, bautista, ponce, de, le, n, led, a, small, exploratory, party, to, puerto, rico, in, 1508, that, found, placer, deposits, of, gold, in, the, western, end, of, the, island, this, expedition, consisting, of, about, 50, men, in, one, ship, left, hispaniola, on, 12, july, 1508, and, eventually, anchored, in, san, juan, bay, near, today, s, city, of, san, juan, ponce, de, le, n, searched, inland, until, he, found, a, suitable, site, about, two, miles, from, the, bay, here, he, erected, a, storehouse, and, a, fortified, house, creating, the, first, settlement, in, puerto, rico, caparra, although, a, few, crops, were, planted, the, settlers, spent, most, of, their, time, and, energy, searching, for, gold, by, early, 1509, ponce, de, le, n, decided, to, return, to, hispaniola, his, expedition, had, collected, a, good, quantity, of, gold, but, was, running, low, on, food, and, supplies, the, expedition, was, deemed, a, great, success, and, ovando, appointed, ponce, de, le, n, governor, of, san, juan, bautista, this, appointment, was, later, confirmed, by, ferdinand, ii, on, 14, august, 1509, he, was, instructed, to, extend, the, settlement, of, the, island, and, continue, mining, for, gold, the, new, governor, returned, to, the, island, as, instructed, bringing, with, him, his, wife, and, children, the, rush, of, spaniards, from, hispaniola, wanting, to, mine, gold, disrupted, the, way, of, life, of, the, ta, no, native, people, back, on, his, island, ponce, de, le, n, parceled, out, the, native, ta, nos, among, himself, and, other, settlers, using, the, system, of, forced, labor, known, as, encomienda, the, indians, were, put, to, work, growing, food, crops, and, mining, for, gold, ponce, put, those, assigned, to, his, personal, encomienda, hacienda, grande, to, work, searching, for, gold, in, the, toa, valley, just, east, of, san, juan, many, of, the, spaniards, treated, the, ta, nos, very, harshly, and, death, rates, were, very, high, the, demand, for, slaves, kidnapped, from, other, islands, grew, by, june, 1511, the, ta, nos, pushed, to, the, limits, of, their, endurance, began, a, short, lived, rebellion, which, was, forcibly, put, down, by, ponce, de, le, n, and, a, small, force, of, troops, armed, with, crossbows, and, arquebuses, long, guns, even, as, ponce, de, le, n, was, settling, the, island, of, san, juan, significant, changes, were, taking, place, in, the, politics, and, government, of, the, spanish, west, indies, on, 10, july, 1509, diego, col, n, the, son, of, christopher, columbus, arrived, in, hispaniola, as, acting, viceroy, replacing, nicol, s, de, ovando, for, several, years, diego, col, n, had, been, waging, a, legal, battle, over, his, rights, to, inherit, the, titles, and, privileges, granted, to, his, father, the, crown, regretted, the, sweeping, powers, that, had, been, granted, to, columbus, and, his, heirs, and, sought, to, establish, more, direct, control, in, the, new, world, in, spite, of, the, crown, s, opposition, col, n, prevailed, in, court, and, ferdinand, was, required, to, appoint, him, viceroy, although, the, courts, had, ordered, that, ponce, de, le, n, should, remain, in, office, col, n, circumvented, this, directive, on, 28, october, 1509, by, appointing, juan, ceron, chief, justice, and, miguel, diaz, chief, constable, of, the, island, effectively, overriding, the, authority, of, the, governor, this, situation, prevailed, until, 2, march, 1510, when, ferdinand, issued, orders, reaffirming, ponce, de, le, n, s, position, as, governor, ponce, de, le, n, then, had, ceron, and, diaz, arrested, and, sent, back, to, spain, the, political, struggle, between, col, n, and, ponce, de, le, n, continued, in, this, manner, for, the, next, few, years, ponce, de, le, n, had, influential, supporters, in, spain, and, ferdinand, regarded, him, as, a, loyal, servant, however, col, n, s, position, as, viceroy, made, him, a, powerful, opponent, and, eventually, it, became, clear, that, ponce, de, le, n, s, position, on, san, juan, was, not, tenable, finally, on, 28, november, 1511, ceron, returned, from, spain, and, was, officially, reinstated, as, governor, rumors, of, undiscovered, islands, to, the, northwest, of, hispaniola, had, reached, spain, by, 1511, and, ferdinand, was, interested, in, forestalling, further, exploration, and, discovery, by, col, n, in, an, effort, to, reward, ponce, de, le, n, for, his, services, ferdinand, urged, him, to, seek, these, new, lands, outside, the, authority, of, col, n, ponce, de, le, n, readily, agreed, to, a, new, venture, and, in, february, 1512, a, royal, contract, was, dispatched, outlining, his, rights, and, authorities, to, search, for, the, islands, of, beniny, the, contract, stipulated, that, ponce, de, le, n, held, exclusive, rights, to, the, discovery, of, beniny, and, neighboring, islands, for, the, next, three, years, he, would, be, governor, for, life, of, any, lands, he, discovered, but, he, was, expected, to, finance, all, costs, of, exploration, and, settlement, himself, in, addition, the, contract, gave, specific, instructions, for, the, distribution, of, gold, native, americans, and, other, profits, extracted, from, the, new, lands, the, contract, made, no, mention, of, a, rejuvenating, fountain, ponce, de, le, n, equipped, three, ships, with, at, least, 200, men, at, his, own, expense, and, set, out, from, puerto, rico, on, 4, march, 1513, the, only, near, contemporary, description, known, for, this, expedition, comes, from, antonio, de, herrera, y, tordesillas, a, spanish, historian, who, apparently, had, access, to, the, original, ships, logs, or, related, secondary, sources, from, which, he, created, a, summary, of, the, voyage, published, in, 1601, the, brevity, of, the, account, and, occasional, gaps, in, the, record, have, led, historians, to, speculate, and, dispute, many, details, of, the, voyage, the, three, ships, in, this, small, fleet, were, the, santiago, the, san, cristobal, and, the, santa, maria, de, la, consolacion, anton, de, alaminos, was, their, chief, pilot, he, was, already, an, experienced, sailor, and, would, become, one, of, the, most, respected, pilots, in, the, region, after, leaving, puerto, rico, they, sailed, northwest, along, the, great, chain, of, bahama, islands, known, then, as, the, lucayos, herrera, wrote, that, on, 27, march, 1513, easter, sunday, they, sighted, land, he, described, as, an, island, that, was, unfamiliar, to, the, sailors, on, the, expedition, because, many, spanish, seamen, were, acquainted, with, the, bahamas, which, had, been, depopulated, by, slaving, ventures, some, scholars, believe, that, this, island, was, actually, florida, as, it, was, thought, to, be, an, island, for, several, years, after, its, formal, discovery, historian, and, marine, archeologist, samuel, turner, says, that, ponce, de, le, n, sighted, the, florida, coast, on, easter, sunday, of, 1513, and, that, many, historians, have, misinterpreted, herrera, s, text, by, claiming, it, was, one, of, the, bahama, islands, ponce, saw, on, that, date, turner, writes, that, because, beimini, is, described, as, an, island, they, assume, that, herrera, refers, to, one, of, the, bahama, islands, variously, proposing, that, this, island, was, eleuthera, man, o, war, cay, great, abaco, or, grand, bahama, for, the, next, several, days, the, fleet, crossed, open, water, until, 2, april, when, they, sighted, land, which, ponce, de, le, n, believed, was, another, island, he, named, it, la, florida, in, recognition, of, the, verdant, landscape, and, because, it, was, the, easter, season, which, the, spaniards, called, pascua, florida, festival, of, flowers, the, following, day, they, came, ashore, to, seek, information, and, take, possession, of, this, new, land, the, precise, location, of, their, landing, on, the, florida, coast, has, been, disputed, for, many, years, some, historians, believe, it, occurred, at, or, near, st, augustine, but, others, prefer, a, more, southerly, landing, at, a, small, harbor, now, called, ponce, de, le, n, inlet, some, believe, that, ponce, came, ashore, even, farther, south, near, the, present, location, of, melbourne, beach, a, hypothesis, first, proposed, by, douglas, peck, an, amateur, historian, who, attempted, to, reconstruct, the, track, of, the, voyage, sailing, in, his, 33, foot, bermuda, rigged, sailboat, samuel, turner, dismisses, this, theory, pointing, out, that, ponce, s, fleet, encountered, a, storm, on, 30, march, sailing, in, it, for, two, days, with, no, indication, in, herrera, of, the, wind, direction, or, how, strong, it, was, and, that, this, fact, complicates, any, attempt, to, reconstruct, the, voyage, not, to, mention, that, peck, s, boat, was, nothing, like, the, spanish, ships, on, 2, april, after, the, weather, improved, ponce, s, pilot, anton, de, alaminos, took, a, navigational, fix, by, the, sun, at, noon, in, nine, fathoms, of, water, with, a, quadrant, or, a, mariner, s, astrolabe, and, obtained, a, reading, of, 30, degrees, 8, minutes, of, latitude, the, coordinate, recorded, in, the, ship, s, log, when, it, was, closest, to, the, landing, site, as, reported, by, herrera, who, had, the, original, logbook, in, 1601, this, latitude, corresponds, to, a, spot, north, of, st, augustine, between, what, is, now, the, guana, tolomato, matanzas, national, estuarine, research, reserve, and, ponte, vedra, beach, the, expedition, sailed, north, for, the, remainder, of, the, day, before, anchoring, for, the, night, and, rowing, ashore, the, next, morning, after, remaining, in, the, area, of, their, first, landing, for, about, five, days, the, ships, turned, south, for, further, exploration, of, the, coast, on, 8, april, they, encountered, a, current, so, strong, that, it, pushed, them, backwards, and, forced, them, to, seek, anchorage, the, smallest, ship, the, san, cristobal, was, carried, out, of, sight, and, lost, for, two, days, this, was, the, first, known, encounter, by, europeans, with, the, gulf, stream, occurring, where, it, reaches, maximum, force, between, the, florida, coast, and, the, bahamas, because, of, the, powerful, boost, provided, by, the, current, it, would, soon, become, the, primary, route, for, eastbound, ships, leaving, the, spanish, west, indies, bound, for, europe, they, continued, down, the, coast, hugging, the, shore, to, avoid, the, strong, head, current, by, 4, may, the, fleet, reached, and, named, biscayne, bay, they, took, on, water, at, an, island, they, named, santa, marta, now, key, biscayne, and, explored, the, tequesta, miami, mound, town, at, the, mouth, of, the, miami, river, the, tequesta, people, did, not, engage, the, spanish, but, instead, evacuated, into, the, coastal, woodlands, on, 15, may, they, left, biscayne, bay, and, sailed, along, the, florida, keys, looking, for, a, passage, to, head, north, and, explore, the, west, coast, of, the, florida, peninsula, from, a, distance, the, keys, reminded, ponce, de, le, n, of, men, who, were, suffering, so, he, named, them, los, martires, the, martyrs, eventually, they, found, a, gap, in, the, reefs, and, sailed, to, the, north, and, other, times, to, the, northeast, until, they, reached, the, florida, mainland, on, 23, may, where, they, encountered, the, calusa, who, refused, to, trade, and, drove, off, the, spanish, ships, by, surrounding, them, with, warriors, in, sea, canoes, armed, with, long, bows, again, the, exact, site, of, their, landfall, is, controversial, the, vicinity, of, charlotte, harbor, is, the, most, commonly, identified, spot, while, some, assert, a, landing, further, north, at, tampa, bay, or, even, pensacola, other, historians, have, argued, the, distances, were, too, great, to, cover, in, the, available, time, and, the, more, likely, location, was, cape, romano, or, cape, sable, here, ponce, de, le, n, anchored, for, several, days, to, take, on, water, and, repair, the, ships, they, were, approached, by, calusa, who, initially, indicated, an, interest, in, trading, but, relations, soon, turned, hostile, several, skirmishes, followed, with, casualties, on, both, sides, the, spaniards, captured, eight, calusa, four, men, and, four, women, and, seized, five, war, canoes, abandoned, by, the, retreating, warriors, on, 5, june, a, final, confrontation, occurred, when, some, 80, calusa, warriors, attacked, a, party, of, eleven, spanish, sailors, the, result, was, a, standoff, with, neither, party, willing, to, come, within, striking, distance, of, their, opponents, weapons, on, 14, june, they, set, sail, again, looking, for, a, chain, of, islands, in, the, west, that, had, been, described, by, their, captives, they, reached, the, dry, tortugas, on, 21, june, there, they, captured, giant, sea, turtles, caribbean, monk, seals, and, thousands, of, seabirds, from, these, islands, they, sailed, southwest, in, an, apparent, attempt, to, circle, around, cuba, and, return, home, to, puerto, rico, failing, to, take, into, account, the, powerful, currents, pushing, them, eastward, they, struck, the, northeast, shore, of, cuba, and, were, initially, confused, about, their, location, once, they, regained, their, bearings, the, fleet, retraced, their, route, east, along, the, florida, keys, and, around, the, florida, peninsula, reaching, grand, bahama, on, 8, july, they, were, surprised, to, come, across, another, spanish, ship, piloted, by, diego, miruelo, who, was, either, on, a, slaving, voyage, or, had, been, sent, by, diego, col, n, to, spy, on, ponce, de, le, n, shortly, thereafter, miruelo, s, ship, was, wrecked, in, a, storm, and, ponce, de, le, n, rescued, the, stranded, crew, from, here, the, little, fleet, disbanded, ponce, de, le, n, tasked, the, santa, maria, with, further, exploration, while, he, returned, home, with, the, rest, of, crew, ponce, de, le, n, reached, puerto, rico, on, 19, october, 1513, after, having, been, away, for, almost, eight, months, the, other, ship, after, further, explorations, returned, safely, on, 20, february, 1514, although, ponce, de, le, n, is, widely, credited, with, the, discovery, of, florida, he, almost, certainly, was, not, the, first, european, to, reach, the, peninsula, spanish, slave, expeditions, had, been, regularly, raiding, the, bahamas, since, 1494, and, there, is, some, evidence, that, one, or, more, of, these, slavers, made, it, as, far, as, the, shores, of, florida, another, piece, of, evidence, that, others, came, before, ponce, de, le, n, is, the, cantino, map, from, 1502, which, shows, a, peninsula, near, cuba, that, looks, like, florida, s, and, includes, characteristic, place, names, according, to, a, popular, legend, ponce, de, le, n, discovered, florida, while, searching, for, the, fountain, of, youth, though, stories, of, vitality, restoring, waters, were, known, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, long, before, ponce, de, le, n, the, story, of, his, searching, for, them, was, not, attached, to, him, until, after, his, death, in, his, historia, general, y, natural, de, las, indias, of, 1535, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, oviedo, y, vald, s, wrote, that, ponce, de, le, n, was, looking, for, the, waters, of, bimini, a, similar, account, appears, in, francisco, l, pez, de, g, mara, s, historia, general, de, las, indias, of, 1551, then, in, 1575, hernando, de, escalante, fontaneda, a, shipwreck, survivor, who, had, lived, with, the, native, americans, of, florida, for, 17, years, published, his, memoir, in, which, he, locates, the, waters, called, the, river, jordan, flowing, out, of, eden, in, florida, and, says, that, ponce, de, le, n, was, supposed, to, have, looked, for, them, there, though, fontaneda, doubted, that, ponce, de, le, n, had, really, gone, to, florida, looking, for, the, waters, the, account, was, included, in, the, historia, general, de, los, hechos, de, los, castellanos, of, antonio, de, herrera, y, tordesillas, of, 1615, most, historians, hold, that, the, search, for, gold, and, the, expansion, of, the, spanish, empire, were, far, more, imperative, than, any, potential, search, for, such, a, fountain, upon, his, return, to, puerto, rico, ponce, de, le, n, found, the, island, in, turmoil, a, party, of, caribs, from, a, neighboring, island, had, attacked, the, settlement, of, caparra, killed, several, spaniards, and, burned, it, to, the, ground, ponce, de, le, n, s, own, house, was, destroyed, and, his, family, narrowly, escaped, col, n, used, the, attack, as, a, pretext, for, renewing, hostilities, against, the, local, ta, no, tribes, the, explorer, suspected, that, col, n, was, working, to, further, undermine, his, position, on, the, island, and, perhaps, even, to, take, his, claims, for, the, newly, discovered, florida, ponce, de, le, n, decided, he, should, return, to, spain, and, personally, report, the, results, of, his, recent, expedition, he, left, puerto, rico, in, april, 1514, and, was, warmly, received, by, ferdinand, when, he, arrived, at, court, in, valladolid, there, he, was, knighted, and, given, a, personal, coat, of, arms, becoming, the, first, conquistador, to, receive, these, honors, he, also, visited, casa, de, contrataci, n, in, seville, which, was, the, central, bureaucracy, and, clearinghouse, for, all, of, spain, s, activities, in, the, new, world, the, casa, took, detailed, notes, of, his, discoveries, and, added, them, to, the, padr, n, real, a, master, map, which, served, as, the, basis, for, official, navigation, charts, provided, to, spanish, captains, and, pilots, during, his, stay, in, spain, a, new, contract, was, drawn, up, for, ponce, de, le, n, confirming, his, rights, to, settle, and, govern, beniny, and, florida, which, was, then, presumed, to, be, an, island, in, addition, to, the, usual, directions, for, sharing, gold, and, other, valuables, with, the, king, the, contract, was, one, of, the, first, to, stipulate, that, the, requerimiento, was, to, be, read, to, the, inhabitants, of, the, islands, prior, to, their, conquest, ponce, de, le, n, was, also, ordered, to, organize, an, armada, for, the, purpose, of, attacking, and, subduing, the, caribs, who, continued, to, attack, spanish, settlements, in, the, caribbean, three, ships, were, purchased, for, his, armada, and, after, repairs, and, provisioning, ponce, de, le, n, left, spain, on, 14, may, 1515, with, his, little, fleet, the, record, of, his, activities, against, the, caribs, is, vague, there, was, one, engagement, in, guadeloupe, on, his, return, to, the, area, and, possibly, two, or, three, other, encounters, the, campaign, came, to, an, abrupt, end, in, 1516, when, ferdinand, died, the, king, had, been, a, strong, supporter, and, ponce, de, le, n, felt, it, was, imperative, he, return, to, spain, and, defend, his, privileges, and, titles, he, did, receive, assurances, of, support, from, cardinal, francisco, jim, nez, de, cisneros, the, regent, appointed, to, govern, castile, but, it, was, nearly, two, years, before, he, was, able, to, return, home, to, puerto, rico, meanwhile, there, had, been, at, least, two, unauthorized, voyages, to, his, florida, both, ending, in, repulsion, by, the, native, calusa, or, tequesta, warriors, ponce, de, le, n, realized, he, had, to, act, soon, if, he, was, to, maintain, his, claim, in, early, 1521, ponce, de, le, n, organized, a, colonizing, expedition, consisting, of, some, 200, men, including, priests, farmers, and, artisans, 50, horses, and, other, domestic, animals, and, farming, implements, carried, on, two, ships, the, expedition, landed, somewhere, on, the, coast, of, southwest, florida, likely, in, the, vicinity, of, charlotte, harbor, or, the, caloosahatchee, river, areas, which, ponce, de, le, n, had, visited, in, his, earlier, voyage, to, florida, before, the, settlement, could, be, established, the, colonists, were, attacked, by, the, calusa, the, indigenous, people, who, dominated, southern, florida, and, whose, principal, town, was, nearby, ponce, de, le, n, was, mortally, wounded, in, the, skirmish, when, historians, believe, an, arrow, poisoned, with, the, sap, of, the, manchineel, tree, struck, his, thigh, the, expedition, immediately, abandoned, the, colonization, attempt, and, sailed, to, havana, cuba, where, ponce, de, le, n, soon, died, of, his, wounds, he, was, buried, in, puerto, rico, in, the, crypt, of, san, jos, church, from, 1559, to, 1836, when, his, remains, were, exhumed, and, transferred, to, the, cathedral, of, san, juan, bautista, inscribed, on, the, side, panel, of, the, altar, tomb, in, his, mausoleum, are, these, words, in, latin, mole, svb, hac, fortis, reqviescvnt, ossa, leonis, ovi, vicit, factis, nomina, magna, svis, under, this, structure, rest, the, bones, of, a, lion, more, for, his, great, deeds, than, for, his, name
