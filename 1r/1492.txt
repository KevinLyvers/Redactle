and, pompey, defeated, carbo, s, lieutenant, the, praetor, gaius, carrinas, in, a, six, hour, battle, at, the, river, aesis, only, to, be, blockaded, by, carbo, himself, when, word, of, sulla, s,

praeneste, where, carbo, s, consular, colleague, marius, the, younger, who, was, the, figurehead, of, the, struggle, against, sulla, was, blockaded, it, was, the, failure, of, these, attempts, to, get, through, the, sullan, blockade, in, umbria, and, etruria, added, to, metellus, s, success, in, winning, control, of, the, north, which, broke, the, back, of, the, government, s, resistance, at,

made, for, praeneste, unable, to, break, through, sulla, s, blockade, they, marched, for, undefended, rome, only, to, be, caught, just, in, time, and, defeated, by, sulla, at, the, battle, of, the, colline, gate, pompey, who, was, pursuing, the, government, forces, arrived, just, after, the, battle, by, the, end, of, 82, bc, sulla, had, expelled, his, opponents, from, italy, and, engineered, his, nomination, as, dictator, by, the, senate, either, through, admiration, of, his, abilities, or, concern, at, his, ambition, sulla, sought, to, consolidate, his, alliance, with, pompey, by, persuading, him, to, divorce, antistia, and, marry, his, stepdaughter, aemilia, plutarch, claims, she, was, already, pregnant, by, her, former, husband, and, died, in, childbirth, soon, after, the, surviving, marians, escaped, to, sicily, where, their, ally, marcus, perperna, was, propraetor, they, were, supported, by, a, fleet, under, carbo, while, gnaeus, domitius, ahenobarbus, occupied, the, roman, province, of, africa, perperna, abandoned, sicily, after, pompey, landed, on, the, island, with, a, large, force, while, carbo, was, captured, and, later, executed, pompey, claimed, this, was, justified, by, carbo, s, alleged, crimes, against, roman, citizens, but, his, opponents, nicknamed, him, adulescentulus, carnifex, or, young, butcher, as, a, result, pompey, now, sailed, for, africa, leaving, sicily, in, the, hands, of, his, brother, in, law, gaius, memmius, after, defeating, and, killing, ahenobarbus, at, the, battle, of, utica, pompey, subdued, numidia, and, executed, its, king, hiarbas, a, marian, ally, he, restored, the, deposed, hiempsal, to, the, numidian, throne, around, this, time, his, troops, began, referring, to, him, as, magnus, or, the, great, after, alexander, the, great, a, figure, much, admired, by, the, romans, shortly, thereafter, pompey, formally, made, this, part, of, his, name, on, returning, to, rome, he, asked, for, a, triumph, to, celebrate, his, victories, an, unprecedented, demand, for, someone, so, young, pompey, refused, to, disband, his, army, until, sulla, agreed, although, the, latter, tried, to, offset, the, impact, by, awarding, simultaneous, triumphs, to, lucius, licinius, murena, and, gaius, valerius, flaccus, sometime, during, this, period, pompey, married, mucia, tertia, a, member, of, the, powerful, metellus, family, they, had, three, children, before, their, divorce, in, 61, bc, pompey, the, younger, usually, known, as, gnaeus, a, daughter, pompeia, magna, and, a, younger, son, sextus, pompey, supported, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, as, consul, for, 78, bc, plutarch, claims, he, did, so, against, sulla, s, advice, but, most, modern, historians, refute, the, idea, when, sulla, died, in, 78, bc, lepidus, sought, to, block, his, state, funeral, and, roll, back, some, of, sulla, s, laws, then, became, proconsul, of, cisalpine, and, transalpine, gaul, in, january, 77, bc, when, the, senate, ordered, him, back, to, rome, lepidus, refused, to, comply, unless, granted, another, term, as, consul, a, proposal, that, was, rapidly, rejected, assembling, an, army, he, began, marching, on, rome, the, senate, responded, with, a, series, of, measures, one, of, which, was, to, appoint, pompey, to, a, military, command, while, lepidus, continued, south, pompey, raised, troops, from, among, his, veterans, in, picenum, and, moved, north, to, besiege, mutina, capital, of, cisalpine, gaul, the, town, was, held, by, lepidus, ally, marcus, junius, brutus, who, surrendered, after, a, lengthy, siege, and, was, assassinated, next, day, allegedly, on, pompey, s, orders, catulus, then, defeated, lepidus, outside, rome, while, pompey, marched, against, his, rear, catching, him, near, cosa, lepidus, and, the, remnants, of, his, army, retreated, to, sardinia, where, he, died, the, sertorian, war, began, in, 80, bc, when, quintus, sertorius, a, prominent, proscribed, marian, general, initiated, a, rebellion, in, hispania, where, he, was, joined, by, other, roman, exiles, like, perperna, supported, by, local, iberian, tribes, he, took, control, of, hispania, ulterior, and, repeatedly, defeated, quintus, caecilius, metellus, pius, through, skillful, use, of, guerrilla, warfare, sertorius, defeated, other, roman, generals, sent, to, oust, him, and, soon, conquered, hispania, citerior, as, well, backed, by, his, allies, in, the, senate, pompey, was, appointed, military, commander, in, spain, with, proconsular, authority, in, order, to, defeat, sertorius, this, act, was, technically, illegal, as, he, had, yet, to, hold, public, office, illustrating, pompey, s, preference, for, military, glory, and, disregard, for, traditional, political, constraints, pompey, recruited, 30, 000, infantry, and, 1, 000, cavalry, evidence, of, the, threat, posed, by, sertorius, en, route, to, hispania, he, subdued, a, rebellion, in, gallia, narbonensis, after, which, his, army, entered, winter, quarters, near, narbo, martius, in, early, 76, bc, he, crossed, the, col, de, portet, and, entered, the, iberian, peninsula, where, he, would, remain, for, the, next, five, years, his, arrival, boosted, the, morale, of, metellus, troops, while, some, rebels, changed, sides, but, soon, after, he, was, defeated, by, sertorius, at, the, battle, of, lauron, losing, one, third, of, his, army, while, inflicting, next, to, no, losses, on, sertorius, army, this, was, a, serious, blow, to, pompey, s, prestige, who, spent, the, rest, of, the, year, re, organising, his, army, metellus, failure, to, dislodge, sertorius, and, pompey, s, defeat, meant, the, senatorial, generals, made, no, progress, in, the, year, in, 75, bc, sertorius, led, the, campaign, against, metellus, while, pompey, defeated, his, subordinates, perperna, and, gaius, herennius, outside, valencia, when, sertorius, took, over, operations, against, pompey, metellus, defeated, his, deputy, lucius, hirtuleius, at, the, battle, of, italica, pompey, faced, sertorius, in, the, indecisive, battle, of, sucro, in, which, sertorius, defeated, pompey, s, right, flank, and, nearly, captured, pompey, himself, but, his, legate, lucius, afranius, defeated, the, sertorian, right, sertorius, withdrew, inland, then, turned, to, fight, at, saguntum, where, pompey, lost, 6, 000, men, including, his, brother, in, law, memmius, reputedly, his, most, effective, subordinate, sertorius, himself, suffered, 3, 000, casualties, one, of, whom, was, hirtuleius, although, metellus, defeated, perperna, in, a, separate, battle, sertorius, was, able, to, withdraw, to, clunia, late, in, the, year, where, he, repaired, the, walls, to, lure, his, opponents, into, a, siege, while, forming, garrisons, from, other, towns, into, a, new, field, army, once, this, was, ready, he, escaped, from, clunia, and, used, it, to, disrupt, roman, logistics, on, land, and, by, sea, lack, of, supplies, forced, metellus, to, quarter, his, troops, in, gaul, while, pompey, wintered, among, the, vaccaei, dire, straits, caused, by, this, stretch, of, the, campaign, and, sertorius, guerrilla, warfare, led, pompey, to, write, a, letter, to, the, senate, asking, for, funds, and, men, and, scolding, their, lack, of, support, for, him, and, metellus, pompey, s, letter, had, the, effect, of, galvanizing, the, senate, into, sending, him, more, men, and, funds, reinforced, by, two, more, legions, in, 74, bc, he, and, metellus, began, a, war, of, attrition, against, their, enemy, as, his, chief, opponent, had, lost, most, of, his, roman, legionaries, and, could, no, longer, match, him, in, the, field, pompey, along, with, metellus, gained, the, upper, hand, conquering, more, and, more, sertorian, cities, slowly, grinding, down, sertorius, revolt, by, now, sertorius, was, being, undermined, by, internal, divisions, discontent, in, sertorius, coalition, of, iberian, and, roman, forces, came, to, a, head, in, 72, or, 73, bc, when, perperna, leading, a, conspiracy, with, other, prominent, sertorians, had, sertorius, assassinated, and, assumed, control, of, the, rebel, army, pompey, engaged, perperna, in, battle, and, defeated, him, swiftly, at, the, battle, near, osca, perperna, was, captured, and, attempted, to, persuade, pompey, to, spare, him, by, giving, over, sertorius, correspondence, allegedly, containing, proof, of, communications, between, the, rebel, leader, and, leading, men, in, rome, pompey, burned, the, letters, unread, and, executed, perperna, and, then, spent, some, time, restructuring, the, local, roman, administration, showing, a, lack, of, animosity, towards, his, former, opponents, which, extended, his, patronage, throughout, hispania, and, into, southern, gaul, pompey, and, his, army, remained, in, hispania, for, a, few, years, conquering, the, sertorian, remnants, and, then, marched, back, to, rome, during, pompey, s, absence, marcus, licinius, crassus, was, charged, with, suppressing, the, slave, rebellion, led, by, spartacus, known, as, the, third, servile, war, pompey, returned, to, italy, just, before, crassus, defeated, the, main, rebel, army, in, 71, bc, arriving, in, time, to, massacre, 6, 000, fugitives, from, the, battle, his, claim, to, have, ended, the, war, by, doing, so, was, a, long, standing, source, of, resentment, for, crassus, pompey, was, granted, a, second, triumph, for, his, victory, in, hispania, and, nominated, for, the, consulship, since, he, was, both, too, young, and, technically, ineligible, this, required, a, special, senatorial, decree, plutarch, suggests, pompey, supported, crassus, as, his, co, consul, in, order, to, put, him, under, an, obligation, the, two, men, were, elected, consuls, for, 70, bc, but, allegedly, differed, on, almost, every, measure, rendering, their, term, politically, barren, and, without, achievement, however, their, consulship, did, see, the, plebeian, tribune, recover, powers, removed, by, sulla, one, of, the, most, significant, was, the, ability, to, veto, senatorial, bills, an, act, often, seen, as, a, turning, point, in, the, politics, of, the, late, republic, although, popular, with, the, people, the, measure, must, have, been, opposed, by, the, optimates, and, thus, passing, it, required, support, from, both, consuls, although, most, extant, sources, barely, mention, crassus, pirates, operated, throughout, the, mediterranean, while, their, fleets, often, formed, temporary, alliances, with, enemies, of, rome, including, sertorius, and, mithridates, their, power, and, range, had, increased, over, the, past, fifty, years, partly, because, of, the, decline, of, traditional, naval, powers, like, rhodes, while, previous, attempts, to, subdue, them, had, been, unsuccessful, however, romans, routinely, referred, to, their, opponents, as, pirates, or, brigands, and, some, historians, argue, it, is, more, accurate, to, see, them, as, a, conventional, enemy, rather, than, disorganised, outlaws, principally, based, in, cilicia, in, 68, bc, they, raided, as, far, as, ostia, rome, s, port, and, kidnapped, two, senators, to, general, outrage, prompted, by, pompey, aulus, gabinius, tribune, of, the, plebs, in, 67, bc, proposed, the, lex, gabinia, giving, him, a, mandate, for, their, suppression, it, granted, him, proconsular, authority, for, three, years, in, any, province, within, 50, miles, of, the, mediterranean, along, with, the, power, to, appoint, legates, and, significant, financial, resources, concerned, by, one, man, holding, such, wide, ranging, powers, the, law, was, opposed, by, the, senate, but, passed, by, the, tribunate, most, of, the, difficulties, pompey, faced, came, from, officials, who, resented, his, authority, in, gaul, piso, hampered, his, recruitment, efforts, while, in, crete, quintus, metellus, refused, to, comply, with, his, instructions, pompey, spread, his, forces, throughout, the, mediterranean, to, prevent, the, pirates, escaping, a, roman, fleet, by, moving, elsewhere, fifteen, legates, were, given, specific, areas, to, patrol, while, he, secured, the, grain, route, to, rome, these, measures, won, him, control, of, the, western, mediterranean, in, just, 40, days, after, which, his, fleets, moved, to, the, east, forcing, the, pirates, back, to, their, bases, in, cilicia, pompey, led, the, decisive, assault, on, their, stronghold, in, coracaesium, winning, the, battle, of, korakesion, and, concluding, the, war, in, only, three, months, most, of, his, opponents, surrendered, without, fighting, thanks, to, pompey, s, reputation, for, clemency, they, were, granted, lands, in, cities, devastated, during, the, mithridatic, war, notably, soli, renamed, pompeiopolis, and, dyme, in, greece, with, others, sent, to, towns, in, libya, and, calabria, these, communities, retained, a, strong, attachment, to, both, rome, and, pompey, in, 73, bc, lucius, licinius, lucullus, formerly, one, of, sulla, s, chief, lieutenants, was, made, proconsul, of, cilicia, and, commander, in, the, third, mithridatic, war, the, war, began, in, 74, bc, when, the, last, ruler, of, bithynia, died, and, left, his, kingdom, to, rome, sparking, an, invasion, by, mithridates, vi, of, pontus, and, tigranes, the, great, of, armenia, lucullus, was, a, skilled, general, who, won, numerous, victories, but, claims, he, was, protracting, the, war, for, power, and, wealth, led, to, a, senate, investigation, while, by, 69, bc, his, troops, were, weary, and, mutinous, in, 68, bc, quintus, marcius, rex, replaced, lucullus, in, cicilia, while, manius, acilius, glabrio, received, bithynia, he, also, assumed, leadership, of, the, war, against, mithridates, but, failed, to, respond, decisively, when, the, latter, re, occupied, much, of, pontus, in, 67, bc, then, attacked, cappadocia, a, roman, ally, seeing, an, opportunity, in, 66, bc, pompey, used, the, tribunate, to, pass, the, lex, manilia, giving, him, extensive, powers, throughout, asia, minor, in, order, to, defeat, mithridates, in, addition, to, those, granted, by, the, lex, gabinia, the, optimates, were, privately, horrified, that, one, man, should, hold, so, much, influence, but, fearful, of, his, popularity, allowed, the, measure, to, pass, incensed, at, being, replaced, lucullus, called, pompey, a, vulture, who, profited, from, the, work, of, others, a, reference, both, to, his, new, command, and, claim, to, have, finished, the, war, against, spartacus, pompey, agreed, an, alliance, with, phraates, iii, king, of, parthia, whom, he, persuaded, to, invade, armenia, when, mithridates, offered, a, truce, lucullus, argued, the, war, was, over, but, pompey, demanded, concessions, which, could, not, be, accepted, outnumbered, mithridates, withdrew, into, armenia, followed, by, pompey, who, defeated, him, at, lycus, near, the, end, of, 66, bc, according, to, contemporary, sources, mithridates, and, a, small, contingent, escaped, the, battle, outstripped, their, pursuers, and, reached, colchis, on, the, black, sea, while, there, he, took, control, of, the, cimmerian, bosporus, from, its, roman, backed, ruler, his, son, machares, who, later, committed, suicide, meanwhile, pompey, invaded, armenia, supported, by, tigranes, the, younger, whose, father, quickly, came, to, terms, in, return, for, the, restoration, of, armenian, territories, taken, by, lucullus, he, paid, a, substantial, cash, indemnity, and, allowed, roman, troops, to, be, based, on, his, territory, in, 65, bc, pompey, set, out, to, take, colchis, but, to, do, so, had, first, to, subdue, various, local, tribes, and, allies, of, mithridrates, after, winning, a, series, of, battles, he, reached, phasis, and, linked, up, with, servilius, admiral, of, his, euxine, fleet, before, a, fresh, revolt, in, caucasian, albania, forced, him, to, retrace, his, steps, victory, at, the, abas, enabled, him, to, impose, terms, on, the, albanians, and, agree, truces, with, other, tribes, on, the, northern, side, of, the, caucasus, pompey, then, wintered, in, armenia, settling, minor, border, contests, and, raids, between, his, allies, phraates, and, tigranes, relying, on, his, naval, blockade, to, wear, down, mithridates, pompey, spent, 64, bc, annexing, the, independent, and, wealthy, cities, of, syria, which, were, incorporated, into, a, new, roman, province, in, the, process, he, acquired, large, amounts, of, money, and, prestige, as, well, as, criticism, from, his, opponents, in, rome, who, argued, doing, so, exceeded, his, authority, meanwhile, an, ageing, mithridates, had, been, cornered, in, panticapaeum, by, another, of, his, sons, pharnaces, ii, of, pontus, an, attempt, to, commit, suicide, by, taking, poison, allegedly, failed, due, to, his, habit, of, taking, precautionary, antidotes, and, he, was, killed, by, the, rebels, pharnaces, sent, his, embalmed, body, to, pompey, in, return, for, which, he, was, granted, the, bosporan, kingdom, and, made, an, ally, of, rome, the, final, collapse, of, the, seleucid, empire, allowed, pompey, to, annex, syria, in, 64, bc, but, its, dissolution, destabilised, the, region, while, many, of, its, cities, had, used, the, power, vacuum, to, achieve, independence, in, early, 63, bc, pompey, left, antioch, and, marched, south, occupying, coastal, cities, like, apamea, before, crossing, the, anti, lebanon, mountains, and, capturing, pella, jordan, and, damascus, pompey, s, incursion, further, south, into, judea, was, occasioned, on, account, of, its, inhabitants, under, the, leadership, of, hyrcanus, ii, and, aristobulus, ii, having, ravaged, phoenicia, and, pompey, wanting, to, bring, a, stop, to, it, the, initial, onslaught, was, disrupted, by, the, hasmonean, civil, war, in, which, pompey, backed, hyrcanus, ii, over, his, brother, aristobulus, ii, when, he, compelled, the, latter, to, surrender, jerusalem, its, defenders, took, refuge, in, the, temple, which, the, romans, first, stormed, then, looted, judea, became, a, client, kingdom, ruled, by, hyrcanus, while, its, northern, section, was, incorporated, into, the, decapolis, a, league, of, semi, autonomous, cities, see, map, both, judea, and, the, league, were, made, subordinate, to, the, new, province, of, syria, other, organisational, changes, included, creating, the, province, of, bithynia, and, pontus, with, the, rest, of, mithridates, territories, distributed, among, roman, allies, elsewhere, ariobarzanes, i, of, cappadocia, was, restored, to, his, throne, while, lesser, armenia, was, taken, from, tigranes, and, incorporated, into, galatia, with, pompey, s, client, deiotarus, becoming, ruler, of, the, new, kingdom, finally, cilicia, received, the, coastal, region, of, pamphylia, previously, a, centre, of, piracy, along, with, other, inland, areas, and, reorganised, into, six, parts, these, actions, significantly, increased, roman, state, income, and, presented, pompey, with, multiple, opportunities, to, increase, his, personal, wealth, and, patronage, base, before, his, return, to, italy, in, 62, bc, pompey, paid, his, troops, bonuses, totalling, around, 16, 000, talents, but, despite, fears, he, intended, to, follow, sulla, s, example, they, were, dismissed, upon, arrival, at, brundisium, his, journey, to, rome, drew, huge, crowds, wherever, he, stopped, showing, that, although, opinion, in, the, senate, was, divided, pompey, remained, as, popular, as, ever, with, the, masses, he, was, awarded, a, third, triumph, for, his, achievements, in, asia, minor, celebrated, on, his, 45th, birthday, in, 61, bc, pompey, claimed, the, new, provinces, established, in, the, east, had, increased, annual, state, income, from, 200, million, to, 340, million, sesterces, plus, an, additional, payment, of, 480, million, sesterces, to, the, treasury, he, refused, to, provide, details, of, his, personal, fortune, but, given, the, amounts, declared, publicly, this, must, have, been, enormous, some, of, it, was, used, to, build, one, of, the, most, famous, structures, of, ancient, rome, the, theatre, of, pompey, however, the, senate, then, refused, to, ratify, the, treaties, agreed, by, pompey, as, part, of, his, settlement, of, the, east, opposition, was, led, by, the, optimates, cato, the, younger, and, metellus, celer, whose, sister, mucia, had, recently, been, divorced, by, pompey, for, reasons, still, disputed, they, also, defeated, a, bill, to, distribute, farmland, to, his, veterans, and, landless, members, of, the, urban, poor, a, similar, measure, had, been, rejected, in, 63, bc, which, arguably, made, the, senate, over, confident, in, their, ability, to, control, popular, unrest, although, pompey, could, not, overcome, optimate, opposition, on, his, own, the, situation, changed, when, marius, nephew, julius, caesar, sought, his, endorsement, for, the, consulship, in, 59, bc, a, skilled, unscrupulous, and, ambitious, politician, an, alliance, allowed, caesar, to, harness, pompey, s, influence, with, the, urban, electorate, with, additional, support, from, crassus, caesar, became, one, of, the, two, consuls, for, 59, bc, the, other, being, the, optimate, marcus, calpurnius, bibulus, this, meant, caesar, could, help, pass, legislation, sponsored, by, pompey, and, crassus, while, it, was, in, his, interest, to, keep, them, aligned, an, important, factor, given, the, rivalry, between, his, two, patrons, despite, appearing, to, be, the, most, junior, caesar, thus, became, central, to, the, first, triumvirate, an, informal, political, alliance, designed, to, counter, balance, the, optimates, pompey, s, influence, was, based, on, his, reputation, as, a, military, commander, and, popularity, with, the, roman, people, crassus, wealth, allowed, him, to, construct, extensive, patronage, networks, but, he, lacked, the, military, clout, essential, for, political, success, in, the, late, republican, era, once, elected, caesar, secured, the, passage, of, a, new, agrarian, bill, helped, by, pompey, s, veterans, who, filled, the, streets, of, rome, and, allegedly, intimidated, the, senate, when, bibulus, opposed, the, measure, he, was, attacked, in, the, forum, and, spent, the, rest, of, his, consulship, under, virtual, house, arrest, caesar, then, ensured, ratification, of, pompey, s, settlements, in, the, east, while, the, lex, vatinia, made, him, governor, of, gallia, cisalpina, and, illyricum, he, was, also, assigned, gallia, transalpina, after, its, governor, died, in, office, before, leaving, rome, to, launch, the, gallic, wars, in, 58, bc, his, alliance, with, pompey, was, strengthened, when, the, latter, married, caesar, s, daughter, julia, senatorial, opposition, to, the, triumvirate, was, led, by, cicero, a, long, standing, pompeian, ally, despite, this, the, latter, supported, the, populist, politician, publius, clodius, pulcher, in, an, attack, on, cicero, for, executing, roman, citizens, without, trial, during, the, catilinarian, conspiracy, although, clodius, succeeded, in, having, cicero, exiled, he, was, recalled, to, rome, by, pompey, eighteen, months, later, in, 58, bc, as, a, result, when, shortages, of, grain, caused, popular, unrest, in, 57, bc, a, grateful, cicero, backed, pompey, s, appointment, as, praefectus, annonae, a, temporary, position, set, up, for, such, occasions, pompey, and, crassus, were, competing, for, command, of, a, new, expedition, to, asia, minor, and, in, 56, bc, they, met, with, caesar, to, resolve, these, issues, although, crassus, was, a, long, standing, rival, there, are, also, indications, pompey, felt, his, status, as, the, foremost, soldier, of, the, republic, was, threatened, by, caesar, s, success, in, gaul, with, this, in, mind, pompey, set, aside, his, differences, with, crassus, to, promote, their, joint, candidature, as, consuls, for, 55, bc, with, caesar, s, support, they, were, duly, elected, after, prolonged, periods, of, the, violence, which, had, become, a, feature, of, roman, political, campaigns, once, in, office, they, ensured, passage, of, a, law, giving, crassus, the, province, of, syria, and, command, of, a, punitive, expedition, against, parthia, providing, him, opportunities, for, both, military, glory, and, loot, pompey, was, assigned, the, restive, provinces, of, hispania, along, with, africa, while, caesar, s, governorships, in, gaul, were, extended, all, three, men, were, given, these, positions, for, a, period, of, five, years, as, well, as, the, right, to, levy, troops, and, make, peace, and, war, with, whomsoever, they, pleased, in, 54, bc, caesar, continued, his, conquest, of, gaul, crassus, opened, his, campaign, against, the, parthians, and, pompey, remained, in, rome, where, his, wife, julia, died, in, child, birth, in, september, contemporary, sources, suggest, that, combined, with, the, death, of, crassus, and, his, son, publius, at, carrhae, in, may, 53, bc, this, removed, any, obstacle, to, direct, confrontation, between, caesar, and, pompey, consular, elections, in, 52, bc, had, to, be, suspended, due, to, widespread, violence, seeking, to, end, his, alliance, with, caesar, the, optimate, bibulus, proposed, pompey, be, elected, sole, consul, an, unprecedented, act, backed, by, both, cato, and, the, tribunate, having, restored, order, pompey, married, cornelia, widow, of, publius, crassus, and, daughter, of, metellus, scipio, nasica, whom, he, appointed, as, his, colleague, for, the, last, five, months, of, the, year, as, consul, pompey, helped, enact, legislation, which, some, historians, view, as, crucial, to, understanding, the, drift, to, war, in, 49, bc, accused, of, using, violence, during, his, consulship, in, 59, bc, caesar, had, previously, been, shielded, by, his, proconsular, immunity, with, private, support, from, pompey, new, laws, made, such, prosecutions, retrospective, which, meant, caesar, would, probably, be, put, on, trial, the, moment, he, left, gaul, and, lost, his, imperium, to, avoid, this, he, had, secured, approval, to, stand, for, the, consulship, in, 48, bc, while, still, in, gaul, but, another, law, backed, by, pompey, required, electoral, candidates, to, be, physically, present, in, rome, although, the, two, continued, to, co, operate, in, public, pompey, clearly, viewed, his, colleague, as, a, threat, as, did, much, of, the, senate, both, consuls, for, 50, bc, paullus, and, gaius, claudius, were, opponents, of, caesar, as, was, curio, a, plebeian, tribune, they, initiated, legislation, to, remove, caesar, from, his, command, in, gaul, who, allegedly, bypassed, this, by, bribing, paullus, and, curio, for, whatever, reason, curio, came, up, with, an, alternative, proposal, caesar, and, pompey, should, disarm, at, the, same, time, or, be, declared, enemies, of, the, state, this, was, a, clever, move, since, it, was, popular, with, those, who, wanted, to, avoid, war, but, unacceptable, to, the, optimates, who, saw, caesar, as, a, danger, that, had, to, be, eliminated, rejection, made, open, conflict, more, likely, and, the, senate, agreed, to, fund, a, consular, army, organised, by, pompey, when, he, fell, ill, while, recruiting, in, naples, the, celebrations, that, followed, his, recovery, allegedly, convinced, pompey, his, popularity, was, sufficient, to, see, off, any, opponent, in, december, caesar, crossed, the, alps, with, a, single, veteran, legion, and, arrived, at, ravenna, close, to, the, border, with, the, roman, republic, a, significant, number, of, senators, opposed, any, concessions, to, caesar, but, many, also, mistrusted, pompey, who, has, been, criticised, for, weak, and, ineffectual, leadership, in, this, period, on, 1, january, 49, bc, caesar, sent, an, ultimatum, demanding, acceptance, of, his, compromise, failing, which, he, would, march, on, rome, to, avenge, his, country, s, wrongs, confident, their, forces, significantly, outnumbered, those, available, to, caesar, on, 7, january, the, senate, declared, him, a, public, enemy, four, days, later, he, crossed, the, rubicon, into, italy, when, the, war, began, caesar, was, a, rebel, with, no, navy, and, three, understrength, legions, while, pompey, was, backed, by, all, the, resources, of, the, roman, state, and, his, clients, in, the, east, however, his, position, was, weaker, than, it, seemed, since, he, was, simply, an, advisor, to, the, senate, many, of, whose, members, either, preferred, a, negotiated, solution, or, regarded, him, with, as, much, suspicion, as, caesar, his, military, strategy, had, to, be, approved, by, the, consuls, and, he, could, only, issue, recommendations, which, were, not, always, followed, for, example, cicero, rejected, a, request, to, help, him, with, recruitment, and, cato, refused, to, take, command, of, sicily, vital, for, control, of, rome, s, grain, supply, plans, to, defend, italy, were, undone, by, the, speed, with, which, caesar, moved, advancing, directly, on, rome, with, minimal, resistance, although, outnumbered, his, troops, were, experienced, veterans, while, many, of, pompey, s, were, new, recruits, a, weakness, made, worse, by, lack, of, co, ordination, cato, s, brother, in, law, the, optimate, leader, lucius, domitius, was, cut, off, and, captured, in, a, hopeless, defence, of, corfinium, and, his, 13, 000, men, incorporated, into, caesar, s, army, led, by, asinius, pollio, they, were, later, used, to, occupy, sicily, pompey, had, abandoned, rome, ordering, all, senators, and, public, officials, to, accompany, him, as, he, withdrew, south, to, brundisium, from, there, he, transported, his, troops, across, the, adriatic, to, dyrrhachium, in, thessaly, an, operation, performed, with, almost, complete, success, lacking, ships, to, pursue, him, caesar, first, secured, his, rear, by, subduing, pompeian, forces, in, hispania, before, returning, to, rome, in, december, 49, bc, this, gave, pompey, time, to, build, an, army, nearly, twice, the, size, of, his, opponents, while, his, navy, destroyed, two, fleets, being, built, for, caesar, ensuring, the, pompeians, retained, control, of, the, sea, lanes, despite, this, in, january, 48, bc, caesar, managed, to, cross, the, adriatic, with, seven, legions, and, land, in, southern, albania, after, capturing, oricum, and, apollonia, he, advanced, on, pompey, s, main, supply, base, at, dyrrhachium, the, latter, arrived, in, time, to, block, the, attempt, and, establish, a, fortified, camp, on, the, other, side, of, the, river, apus, where, the, two, armies, remained, until, spring, neither, commander, was, anxious, to, begin, hostilities, since, caesar, was, too, weak, militarily, while, as, with, mithridates, pompey, preferred, to, starve, his, opponent, into, submission, in, late, march, the, stalemate, was, broken, when, mark, antony, finally, managed, to, cross, the, adriatic, with, four, more, legions, and, land, at, nymphaeum, some, 57, kilometres, north, of, dyrrachium, pompey, tried, to, prevent, the, two, caesarian, armies, from, linking, up, by, marching, north, east, and, laying, an, ambush, for, antony, the, ambush, however, was, revealed, to, antony, by, some, local, caesarian, sympathisers, and, he, stayed, in, camp, until, caesar, approached, pompey, not, willing, to, be, caught, between, the, two, caesarian, forces, withdrew, caesar, his, army, now, united, with, antony, s, force, redeployed, his, forces, by, sending, one, and, a, half, legion, to, win, support, and, gather, supplies, in, aetolia, and, thessaly, and, a, further, two, legions, under, domitius, calvinus, to, intercept, metellus, scipio, in, macedonia, meanwhile, gnaeus, pompey, s, oldest, son, managed, to, destroy, caesar, s, fleet, at, oricum, and, lissus, making, sure, no, more, reinforcements, and, supplies, would, reach, caesar, from, italy, caesar, tried, to, lure, pompey, into, a, pitched, battle, at, asparagium, but, the, latter, refused, the, next, day, caesar, outmaneuvred, pompey, and, marched, for, dyrrachium, again, when, pompey, arrived, at, the, city, caesar, had, already, set, up, camp, caesar, lacked, the, siege, equipment, needed, to, take, dyrrhachium, and, could, not, risk, leaving, pompey, to, threaten, his, rear, he, solved, this, by, besieging, pompey, in, his, camp, although, the, latter, had, enough, food, water, was, scarce, because, caesar, had, dammed, the, local, rivers, and, the, pompeian, cavalry, lacked, forage, for, their, horses, ending, the, stalemate, became, a, matter, of, urgency, and, in, late, july, pompey, finally, managed, to, break, through, part, of, caesar, s, defensive, lines, since, this, made, the, blockade, pointless, caesar, cut, his, losses, and, withdrew, to, apollonia, at, this, point, metellus, scipio, arrived, in, thessaly, caesar, moved, south, to, confront, this, threat, and, link, up, with, domitius, calvinus, allowing, his, men, to, sack, gomphi, en, route, pursued, by, pompey, he, then, withdrew, to, the, area, near, pharsalus, but, failed, to, tempt, pompey, into, giving, battle, although, it, was, later, claimed, pompey, only, did, so, after, being, pressured, by, his, subordinates, the, delay, may, simply, have, been, a, reflection, of, his, natural, caution, regardless, pompey, s, army, of, around, 38, 000, outnumbered, the, 22, 000, men, commanded, by, caesar, with, 7, 000, cavalry, to, 1, 000, on, 9, august, he, deployed, his, men, in, battle, formation, planning, to, use, his, superior, cavalry, to, outflank, his, opponent, on, his, left, caesar, had, anticipated, this, and, repulsed, the, cavalry, which, fled, in, confusion, exposing, the, infantry, behind, them, under, pressure, from, the, left, and, in, front, the, pompeian, army, collapsed, pompey, escaped, from, the, battlefield, and, made, his, way, to, mytilene, where, he, was, reunited, with, his, wife, cornelia, most, of, his, eastern, allies, were, present, at, pharsalus, and, had, either, been, killed, or, captured, the, main, absentee, was, 14, year, old, ptolemy, xiii, ruler, of, the, wealthy, and, strategically, important, kingdom, of, egypt, making, it, an, obvious, destination, cato, announced, his, intention, to, continue, the, war, from, africa, although, most, of, his, senatorial, colleagues, including, cicero, and, marcus, junius, brutus, made, their, peace, with, caesar, and, returned, to, rome, pompey, sailed, from, cyprus, with, a, small, fleet, and, on, 28, september, 48, bc, arrived, at, pelusium, in, egypt, where, ptolemy, was, engaged, in, a, bitter, civil, war, with, his, co, ruler, and, elder, sister, cleopatra, vii, when, he, went, ashore, to, greet, an, official, delegation, pompey, was, killed, by, lucius, septimius, a, roman, officer, and, former, colleague, serving, in, the, egyptian, army, his, body, was, cremated, by, two, servants, while, the, head, was, kept, as, evidence, one, suggestion, is, that, ptolemy, and, his, advisors, feared, pompey, planned, to, seize, control, of, egypt, especially, since, many, egyptian, army, officers, were, roman, mercenaries, like, septimius, who, had, previously, served, with, him, at, the, same, time, it, seemed, an, easy, way, to, win, caesar, s, support, against, cleopatra, although, ultimately, this, proved, not, to, be, the, case, pompey, s, head, was, later, returned, to, cornelia, for, burial, at, his, villa, in, the, alban, hills, while, his, ignominious, death, prompted, cicero, to, write, his, life, outlasted, his, power, pompey, had, five, wives, pompey, s, military, glory, was, second, to, none, for, two, decades, yet, his, skills, were, occasionally, criticized, by, some, of, his, contemporaries, sertorius, or, lucullus, for, instance, were, especially, critical, pompey, s, tactics, were, usually, efficient, albeit, not, particularly, innovative, or, imaginative, and, they, could, prove, insufficient, against, greater, tacticians, however, pharsalus, was, his, only, decisive, defeat, at, times, he, was, reluctant, to, risk, an, open, battle, while, not, extremely, charismatic, pompey, could, display, tremendous, bravery, and, fighting, skills, on, the, battlefield, which, inspired, his, men, while, being, a, superb, commander, pompey, also, earned, a, reputation, for, stealing, other, generals, victories, on, the, other, hand, pompey, is, usually, considered, an, outstanding, strategist, and, organizer, who, could, win, campaigns, without, displaying, genius, on, the, battlefield, but, simply, by, constantly, outmaneuvering, his, opponents, and, gradually, pushing, them, into, a, desperate, situation, pompey, was, a, great, forward, planner, and, had, tremendous, organizational, skill, which, allowed, him, to, devise, grand, strategies, and, operate, effectively, with, large, armies, during, his, campaigns, in, the, east, he, relentlessly, pursued, his, enemies, choosing, the, ground, for, his, battles, above, all, he, was, often, able, to, adapt, to, his, enemies, and, showed, determination, on, many, occasions, he, acted, very, swiftly, and, decisively, as, he, did, during, his, campaigns, in, sicily, and, africa, or, against, the, cilician, pirates, during, the, sertorian, war, on, the, other, hand, pompey, was, beaten, several, times, by, sertorius, despite, an, abysmal, first, year, of, the, war, for, pompey, in, 76, bc, he, continued, to, campaign, vigorously, and, as, a, result, defeated, many, of, sertorius, subordinates, after, sertorius, army, was, greatly, diminished, pompey, then, decided, to, conduct, a, war, of, attrition, in, which, he, would, avoid, open, battles, against, his, chief, opponent, but, instead, tried, to, gradually, regain, the, strategic, advantage, by, capturing, his, fortresses, and, cities, and, defeating, his, junior, officers, this, strategy, was, unspectacular, but, it, led, to, constant, territorial, gains, and, did, much, to, demoralize, the, sertorian, forces, by, 73, or, 72, bc, when, he, was, assassinated, sertorius, was, already, in, a, desperate, situation, and, his, troops, were, deserting, against, perperna, a, tactician, far, inferior, to, his, former, commander, in, chief, pompey, decided, to, revert, to, a, more, aggressive, strategy, and, he, scored, a, decisive, victory, that, effectively, ended, the, war, against, caesar, too, his, strategy, was, sound, during, the, campaign, in, greece, he, managed, to, regain, the, initiative, join, his, forces, to, that, of, metellus, scipio, something, that, caesar, wanted, to, avoid, and, trap, his, enemy, his, strategic, position, was, hence, much, better, than, that, of, caesar, and, he, could, have, starved, caesar, s, army, to, death, however, he, was, finally, compelled, to, fight, an, open, battle, by, his, allies, and, his, conventional, tactics, proved, no, match, to, those, of, caesar, who, also, commanded, the, more, experienced, troops, pompey, was, so, striking, a, figure, and, his, fall, so, dramatic, that, his, story, became, the, subject, of, frequent, literary, treatment, in, the, century, after, his, death, the, civil, war, between, himself, and, caesar, was, retold, in, lucan, s, epic, de, bello, civili, now, known, as, the, pharsalia, after, the, culminating, battle, in, the, poem, s, final, sections, however, pompey, s, vengeful, ghost, returns, to, possess, those, responsible, for, his, murder, in, egypt, and, bring, about, their, death, in, renaissance, britain, too, several, plays, returned, to, the, subject, of, caesar, and, pompey, including, george, chapman, s, the, wars, of, pompey, and, caesar, c, 1604, another, contemporary, treatment, by, thomas, kyd, cornelia, or, pompey, the, great, his, faire, cornelia, s, tragedy, 1594, was, a, translation, from, the, french, of, robert, garnier, later, in, france, pompey, s, story, was, told, without, the, character, appearing, onstage, in, pierre, corneille, s, la, mort, de, pomp, e, 1643, and, this, too, had, english, adaptations, as, pompey, 1663, by, catherine, philips, as, pompey, the, great, by, edmund, waller, and, others, in, 1664, and, later, as, the, death, of, pompey, 1724, by, colley, cibber, later, in, the, 18th, century, pompey, is, made, the, recipient, of, a, heroical, epistle, in, rhyming, couplets, from, a, supposed, former, lover, in, john, hervey, s, flora, to, pompey, he, also, figures, in, narrative, poems, of, the, 19th, century, john, edmund, reade, s, the, vale, of, tempe, records, the, fugitive, s, desperate, appearance, as, glimpsed, by, a, bystander, in, the, greek, valley, his, arrival, in, egypt, is, related, by, alaric, watts, in, the, death, of, pompey, the, great, and, the, ruined, column, raised, to, mark, the, site, of, his, killing, outside, alexandria, is, described, by, nicholas, michell, in, ruins, of, many, lands, these, were, followed, by, john, masefield, s, prose, drama, the, tragedy, of, pompey, the, great, of, 1910, covering, the, period, from, his, decision, to, fight, caesar, to, his, assassination, in, egypt, the, play, was, later, filmed, for, television, in, 1950, for, the, bbc, sunday, night, theatre, pompey, s, career, is, recapitulated, a, century, later, in, series, of, historical, novels, in, colleen, mccullough, s, masters, of, rome, pompey, is, mainly, featured, in, books, iii, v, covering, his, rise, to, prominence, through, to, his, betrayal, and, murder, in, egypt, pompey, is, also, a, recurring, character, in, steven, saylor, s, roma, sub, rosa, crime, fiction, novels, where, he, brushes, shoulders, with, gordianus, the, main, protagonist, of, the, series, another, fiction, series, in, which, pompey, plays, a, part, in, the, historical, background, is, robert, harris, s, trilogy, of, the, life, of, cicero
