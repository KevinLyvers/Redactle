over, the, duchy, of, lotharingia, and, his, role, as, true, successor, to, charlemagne, whose, last, heirs, in, east, francia, had, died, out, in, 911, according, to, widukind, of, corvey, otto, had,

his, capital, at, laon, while, otto, gained, some, initial, victories, against, the, rebels, he, was, unable, to, capture, the, conspirators, and, end, the, rebellion, archbishop, frederick, sought, to, mediate, peace, between, the, combatants, but, otto, rejected, his, proposal, under, otto, s, direction, duke, herman, of, swabia, led, an, army, against, the, conspirators, into, franconia, and, lorraine, otto, recruited, allies, from, the, duchy, of, alsace, who, crossed, the, rhine, river, and, surprised, eberhard, and, gilbert, at, the, battle, of, andernach, on, 2, october, 939, otto, s, forces, claimed, an, overwhelming, victory, eberhard, was, killed, in, battle, and, gilbert, drowned, in, the, rhine, while, attempting, to, escape, left, alone, to, face, his, brother, henry, submitted, to, otto, and, the, rebellion, ended, with, eberhard, dead, otto, assumed, direct, rule, over, the, duchy, of, franconia, and, dissolved, it, into, smaller, counties, and, bishoprics, accountable, directly, to, him, the, same, year, otto, made, peace, with, louis, iv, whereby, louis, recognized, his, suzerainty, over, lorraine, in, return, otto, withdrew, his, army, and, arranged, for, his, sister, gerberga, the, widow, of, gilbert, to, marry, louis, iv, in, 940, otto, and, henry, were, reconciled, through, the, efforts, of, their, mother, henry, returned, to, east, francia, and, otto, appointed, him, as, the, new, duke, of, lorraine, to, succeed, gilbert, henry, had, not, dropped, his, ambitions, for, the, german, throne, and, initiated, another, conspiracy, against, his, older, brother, with, the, assistance, of, archbishop, frederick, of, mainz, henry, planned, to, have, otto, assassinated, on, easter, day, 941, at, quedlinburg, abbey, otto, discovered, the, plot, and, had, the, conspirators, arrested, and, imprisoned, at, ingelheim, the, king, later, released, and, pardoned, both, men, only, after, they, publicly, performed, penance, on, christmas, day, that, same, year, the, decade, between, 941, and, 951, was, marked, by, otto, s, exercise, of, undisputed, domestic, power, through, the, subordination, of, the, dukes, under, his, authority, otto, asserted, his, power, to, make, decisions, without, their, prior, agreement, he, deliberately, ignored, the, claims, and, ranks, of, the, nobility, who, wanted, dynastic, succession, in, the, assignment, of, office, by, freely, appointing, individuals, of, his, choice, to, the, kingdom, s, offices, loyalty, to, otto, not, lineage, was, the, pathway, towards, advancement, under, his, rule, his, mother, matilda, disapproved, of, this, policy, and, was, accused, by, otto, s, royal, advisers, of, undermining, his, authority, after, otto, briefly, exiled, her, to, her, westphalian, manors, at, enger, in, 947, matilda, was, brought, back, to, court, at, the, urging, of, his, wife, eadgyth, the, nobility, found, it, difficult, to, adapt, to, otto, as, the, kingdom, had, never, before, followed, individual, succession, to, the, throne, whereas, tradition, dictated, that, all, the, sons, of, the, former, king, were, to, receive, a, portion, of, the, kingdom, henry, s, succession, plan, placed, otto, at, the, head, of, a, united, kingdom, at, the, expense, of, his, brothers, otto, s, authoritarian, style, was, in, stark, contrast, to, that, of, his, father, henry, had, purposely, waived, church, anointment, at, coronation, as, a, symbol, of, his, election, by, his, people, and, governing, his, kingdom, on, the, basis, of, friendship, pacts, latin, amicitia, henry, regarded, the, kingdom, as, a, confederation, of, duchies, and, saw, himself, as, a, first, among, equals, instead, of, seeking, to, administer, the, kingdom, through, royal, representatives, as, charlemagne, had, done, henry, allowed, the, dukes, to, maintain, complete, internal, control, of, their, holdings, as, long, as, his, superior, status, was, recognized, otto, on, the, other, hand, had, accepted, church, anointment, and, regarded, his, kingdom, as, a, feudal, monarchy, with, himself, holding, the, divine, right, to, rule, it, he, reigned, without, concern, for, the, internal, hierarchy, of, the, various, kingdoms, noble, families, this, new, policy, ensured, otto, s, position, as, undisputed, master, of, the, kingdom, members, of, his, family, and, other, aristocrats, who, rebelled, against, otto, were, forced, to, confess, their, guilt, publicly, and, unconditionally, surrender, to, him, hoping, for, a, pardon, from, their, king, for, nobles, and, other, high, ranking, officials, otto, s, punishments, were, typically, mild, and, the, punished, were, usually, restored, to, a, position, of, authority, afterwards, his, brother, henry, rebelled, twice, and, was, pardoned, twice, after, his, surrenders, he, was, even, appointed, duke, of, lorraine, and, later, duke, of, bavaria, rebellious, commoners, were, treated, far, more, harshly, otto, usually, had, them, executed, otto, continued, to, reward, loyal, vassals, for, their, service, throughout, his, tenure, as, king, although, appointments, were, still, gained, and, held, at, his, discretion, they, were, increasingly, intertwined, with, dynastic, politics, where, henry, relied, upon, friendship, pacts, otto, relied, upon, family, ties, otto, refused, to, accept, uncrowned, rulers, as, his, equal, under, otto, the, integration, of, important, vassals, took, place, through, marriage, connections, king, louis, iv, of, france, had, married, otto, s, sister, gerberga, in, 939, and, otto, s, son, liudolf, had, married, ida, the, daughter, of, hermann, i, duke, of, swabia, in, 947, the, former, dynastically, tied, the, royal, house, of, west, francia, to, that, of, east, francia, and, the, latter, secured, his, son, s, succession, to, the, duchy, of, swabia, as, hermann, had, no, sons, otto, s, plans, came, to, fruition, when, in, 950, liudolf, became, duke, of, swabia, and, in, 954, otto, s, nephew, lothair, of, france, became, king, of, france, in, 944, otto, appointed, conrad, the, red, as, duke, of, lorraine, and, brought, him, into, his, extended, family, through, his, marriage, to, otto, s, daughter, liutgarde, in, 947, a, salian, frank, by, birth, conrad, was, a, nephew, of, former, king, conrad, i, of, germany, following, the, death, of, otto, s, uncle, berthold, duke, of, bavaria, in, 947, otto, satisfied, his, brother, henry, s, ambition, through, his, marriage, to, judith, duchess, of, bavaria, daughter, of, arnulf, duke, of, bavaria, and, appointed, him, as, the, new, duke, of, bavaria, in, 948, this, arrangement, finally, achieved, peace, between, the, brothers, as, henry, thereafter, abandoned, his, claims, to, the, throne, through, his, familial, ties, to, the, dukes, otto, had, strengthened, the, sovereignty, of, the, crown, and, the, overall, cohesiveness, of, the, kingdom, on, 29, january, 946, eadgyth, died, suddenly, at, the, age, of, 35, and, otto, buried, his, wife, in, the, cathedral, of, magdeburg, the, union, had, lasted, sixteen, years, and, produced, two, children, with, eadgyth, s, death, otto, began, to, make, arrangements, for, his, succession, like, his, father, before, him, otto, intended, to, transfer, sole, rule, of, the, kingdom, to, his, son, liudolf, upon, his, death, otto, called, together, all, leading, figures, of, the, kingdom, and, had, them, swear, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, liudolf, thereby, promising, to, recognize, his, sole, claim, to, the, throne, as, otto, s, heir, apparent, relying, on, recent, archaeological, evidences, bachrach, estimates, that, the, armies, he, mobilized, in, 953, and, 954, should, have, been, in, the, range, of, 20, 000, to, 25, 000, men, which, were, needed, to, besiege, cities, such, as, mainz, which, was, defended, by, armies, in, excess, of, 30, 000, the, west, frankish, kings, had, lost, considerable, royal, power, after, internal, struggles, with, their, aristocracy, but, still, asserted, their, authority, over, the, duchy, of, lorraine, a, territory, also, claimed, by, east, francia, the, german, king, was, supported, by, louis, iv, s, chief, domestic, rival, hugh, the, great, louis, iv, s, second, attempt, to, reign, over, lorraine, in, 940, was, based, on, his, asserted, claim, to, be, the, rightful, duke, of, lorraine, due, to, his, marriage, to, gerberga, of, saxony, otto, s, sister, and, the, widow, of, gilbert, duke, of, lorraine, otto, did, not, recognize, louis, iv, s, claim, and, appointed, his, brother, henry, as, duke, instead, in, the, following, years, both, sides, tried, to, increase, their, influence, in, lorraine, but, the, duchy, remained, a, part, of, otto, s, kingdom, despite, their, rivalry, louis, iv, and, hugh, were, both, tied, to, otto, s, family, through, marriage, bonds, otto, intervened, for, peace, in, 942, and, announced, a, formal, reconciliation, between, the, two, as, a, part, of, the, deal, hugh, was, to, perform, an, act, of, submission, to, louis, iv, and, in, return, louis, iv, was, to, waive, any, claims, to, lorraine, after, a, short, period, of, peace, the, west, frankish, kingdom, fell, into, another, crisis, in, 946, normans, captured, louis, iv, and, handed, him, over, to, hugh, who, released, the, king, only, on, condition, of, the, surrender, of, the, fortress, of, laon, at, the, urging, of, his, sister, gerberga, otto, invaded, france, on, behalf, of, louis, iv, but, his, armies, were, not, strong, enough, to, take, the, key, cities, of, laon, reims, and, paris, after, three, months, otto, finally, lifted, the, siege, without, defeating, hugh, but, managed, to, depose, hugh, of, vermandois, from, his, position, as, archbishop, of, reims, restoring, artald,

by, more, than, 30, bishops, including, all, the, archbishops, of, germany, a, demonstration, of, otto, s, strong, position, in, east, and, west, francia, alike, the, synod, confirmed, otto, s, appointment, of, artald, as, archbishop, of, reims, and, hugh, was, admonished, to, respect, his, king, s, royal, authority, but, it, was, not, until, 950, that, the, powerful, vassal, accepted, louis, iv, as, king, the, opponents, were, not, fully, reconciled, until, march, 953, otto, left, the, sorting, out, of, west, frankish, affairs, to, his, son, in, law, conrad, the, red, and, later, bruno, the, great, together, with, otto, s, sisters, gerberga, and, hadwig, who, were, regents, for, their, sons, king, lothar, and, duke, hugh, otto, had, received, the, feudal, commendation, of, several, west, frankish, magnates, and, like, his, father, had, settled, royal, and, episcopal, succession, disputes, in, the, western, kingdom, bruno, intervened, militarily, in, west, francia, in, 958, as, well, as, against, the, reginarids, in, lotharingia, however, this, ottonian, hegemony, from, 940, to, 965, was, personal, rather, than, institutional, and, quickly, disappeared, after, the, accession, of, hugh, capet, in, 987, otto, continued, the, peaceful, relationship, between, germany, and, the, kingdom, of, burgundy, initiated, by, his, father, king, rudolf, ii, of, burgundy, had, previously, married, bertha, of, swabia, the, daughter, of, one, of, henry, s, chief, advisers, in, 922, burgundy, was, originally, a, part, of, middle, francia, the, central, portion, of,

chief, domestic, opponent, claimed, the, burgundian, throne, otto, intervened, in, the, succession, and, with, his, support, rudolf, ii, s, son, conrad, of, burgundy, was, able, to, secure, the, throne, burgundy, had, become, an, integral, but, formally, independent, part, of, otto, s, sphere, of, influence, and, remained, at, peace, with, germany, during, his, reign, boleslaus, i, duke, of, bohemia, assumed, the, bohemian, throne, in, 935, the, next, year, following, the, death, of, otto, s, father, king, henry, the, fowler, boleslaus, stopped, paying, tribute, to, the, german, kingdom, east, francia, in, violation, of, the, peace, treaty, henry, had, established, with, boleslaus, brother, and, predecessor, wenceslaus, i, boleslaus, attacked, an, ally, of, the, saxons, in, northwest, bohemia, in, 936, and, defeated, two, of, otto, s, armies, from, thuringia, and, merseburg, after, this, initial, large, scale, invasion, of, bohemia, hostilities, were, pursued, mainly, in, the, form, of, border, raids, the, war, was, not, concluded, until, 950, when, otto, besieged, a, castle, owned, by, boleslaus, son, boleslaus, decided, to, sign, a, peace, treaty, promising, to, resume, payment, of, tribute, boleslaus, became, otto, s, ally, and, his, bohemian, force, helped, the, german, army, against, the, common, magyar, threat, at, the, lech, river, in, 955, later, he, went, on, to, crush, an, uprising, of, two, slavic, dukes, stoigniew, and, nako, in, mecklenburg, probably, to, ensure, the, spread, of, bohemian, estates, to, the, east, during, his, early, reign, otto, fostered, close, relations, with, emperor, constantine, vii, porphyrogenitus, who, ruled, over, the, byzantine, empire, from, 913, until, his, death, in, 959, east, francia, and, byzantium, sent, several, ambassadors, to, one, another, bishop, thietmar, of, merseburg, a, medieval, chronicler, records, after, this, legates, from, the, greeks, twice, brought, gifts, from, their, emperor, to, our, king, both, rulers, being, in, a, state, of, concord, it, was, during, this, time, that, otto, first, tried, to, link, himself, to, the, eastern, empire, through, marriage, negotiations, as, otto, was, finalizing, actions, to, suppress, his, brother, s, rebellion, in, 939, the, slavs, on, the, elbe, river, revolted, against, german, rule, having, been, subdued, by, otto, s, father, in, 928, the, slavs, saw, henry, s, rebellion, as, an, opportunity, to, regain, their, independence, otto, s, lieutenant, in, east, saxony, count, gero, of, merseburg, was, charged, with, the, subjugation, of, the, pagan, polabian, slavs, according, to, widukind, gero, invited, about, thirty, slavic, chieftains, to, a, banquet, after, the, feast, his, soldiers, attacked, and, massacred, the, unsuspecting, drunken, guests, the, slavs, demanded, revenge, and, marched, against, gero, with, an, enormous, army, otto, agreed, to, a, brief, truce, with, his, rebellious, brother, henry, and, moved, to, support, gero, after, fierce, fighting, their, combined, forces, were, able, to, repel, the, advancing, slavs, otto, then, returned, west, to, subdue, his, brother, s, rebellion, in, 941, gero, initiated, another, plot, to, subdue, the, slavs, he, recruited, a, captive, slav, named, tugumir, a, hevelli, chieftain, to, his, cause, gero, promised, to, support, him, in, claiming, the, hevellian, throne, if, tugumir, would, later, recognize, otto, as, his, overlord, tugumir, agreed, and, returned, to, the, slavs, due, to, gero, s, massacre, few, slavic, chieftains, remained, and, the, slavs, quickly, proclaimed, tugumir, as, their, prince, upon, assuming, the, throne, tugumir, murdered, his, chief, rival, and, proclaimed, his, loyalty, to, otto, incorporating, his, territory, into, the, german, kingdom, otto, granted, tugumir, the, title, of, duke, and, allowed, tugumir, to, rule, his, people, subject, to, otto, s, suzerainty, in, the, same, manner, as, the, german, dukes, after, the, coup, by, gero, and, tugumir, the, slavic, federation, broke, apart, in, control, of, the, key, hevelli, stronghold, of, brandenburg, gero, was, able, to, attack, and, defeat, the, divided, slavic, tribes, otto, and, his, successors, extended, their, control, into, eastern, europe, through, military, colonization, and, the, establishment, of, churches, upon, the, death, of, emperor, charles, the, fat, in, 888, the, empire, of, charlemagne, was, divided, into, several, territories, east, francia, west, francia, the, kingdoms, of, lower, and, upper, burgundy, and, the, kingdom, of, italy, with, each, of, the, realms, being, ruled, by, its, own, king, though, the, pope, in, rome, continued, to, invest, the, kings, of, italy, as, emperors, to, rule, charlemagne, s, empire, these, italian, emperors, never, exercised, any, authority, north, of, the, alps, when, berengar, i, of, italy, was, assassinated, in, 924, the, last, nominal, heir, to, charlemagne, was, dead, and, the, imperial, title, was, left, unclaimed, king, rudolf, ii, of, upper, burgundy, and, hugh, count, of, provence, the, effective, ruler, of, lower, burgundy, competed, with, military, means, to, gain, dominion, over, italy, in, 926, hugh, s, armies, defeated, rudolf, hugh, could, so, establish, de, facto, control, over, the, italian, peninsula, and, had, himself, crowned, as, king, of, italy, his, son, lothair, was, elevated, to, co, ruler, in, 931, hugh, and, rudolf, ii, eventually, concluded, a, peace, treaty, in, 933, four, years, later, lothair, was, betrothed, to, rudolf, s, infant, daughter, adelaide, in, 940, berengar, ii, margrave, of, ivrea, a, grandson, of, former, king, berengar, i, led, a, revolt, of, italian, nobles, against, his, uncle, hugh, forewarned, by, lothair, hugh, exiled, berengar, ii, from, italy, and, the, margrave, fled, to, the, protection, of, otto, s, court, in, 941, in, 945, berengar, ii, returned, and, defeated, hugh, with, the, support, of, the, italian, nobility, hugh, abdicated, in, favor, of, his, son, and, retired, to, provence, berengar, ii, made, terms, with, lothair, and, established, himself, as, the, decisive, power, behind, the, throne, lothair, married, the, sixteen, year, old, adelaide, in, 947, and, became, nominal, king, when, hugh, died, on, 10, april, 948, but, berengar, ii, continued, to, hold, power, as, mayor, of, the, palace, or, viceroy, lothair, s, brief, reign, came, to, an, end, with, his, death, on, 22, november, 950, and, berengar, ii, was, crowned, king, on, 15, december, with, his, son, adalbert, of, italy, as, co, ruler, failing, to, receive, widespread, support, berengar, ii, attempted, to, legitimize, his, reign, and, tried, to, force, adelaide, the, respective, daughter, daughter, in, law, and, widow, of, the, last, three, italian, kings, into, marriage, with, adalbert, adelaide, fiercely, refused, and, was, imprisoned, by, berengar, ii, at, garda, lake, with, the, help, of, count, adalbert, atto, of, canossa, she, managed, to, escape, from, imprisonment, besieged, by, berengar, ii, in, canossa, adelaide, sent, an, emissary, across, the, alps, seeking, otto, s, protection, and, marriage, a, marriage, to, adelaide, would, have, strengthened, the, king, s, position, to, claim, the, italian, throne, and, ultimately, the, emperorship, knowing, of, her, great, intelligence, and, immense, wealth, otto, accepted, adelaide, s, marriage, proposal, and, prepared, for, an, expedition, into, italy, in, the, early, summer, of, 951, before, his, father, marched, across, the, alps, otto, s, son, liudolf, duke, of, swabia, invaded, lombardy, in, northern, italy, the, exact, reasons, for, liudolf, s, action, are, unclear, and, historians, have, proposed, several, possible, motives, liudolf, may, have, tried, to, help, adelaide, a, distant, relative, of, liudolf, s, wife, ida, or, he, intended, to, strengthen, his, position, within, the, royal, family, the, young, heir, was, also, competing, with, his, uncle, duke, henry, i, of, bavaria, both, in, german, affairs, and, northern, italy, while, liudolf, was, preparing, his, expedition, henry, influenced, the, italian, aristocrats, not, to, join, liudolf, s, campaign, when, liudolf, arrived, in, lombardy, he, found, no, support, and, was, unable, to, sustain, his, troops, his, army, was, near, destruction, until, otto, s, troops, crossed, the, alps, the, king, reluctantly, received, liudolf, s, forces, into, his, command, angry, at, his, son, for, his, independent, actions, otto, and, liudolf, s, troops, arrived, in, northern, italy, in, september, 951, without, opposition, from, berengar, ii, as, they, descended, into, the, po, river, valley, the, italian, nobles, and, clergy, withdrew, their, support, for, berengar, and, provided, aid, to, otto, and, his, advancing, army, recognizing, his, weakened, position, berengar, ii, fled, from, his, capital, in, pavia, when, otto, arrived, at, pavia, on, 23, september, 951, the, city, willingly, opened, its, gate, to, the, german, king, who, was, crowned, king, of, the, lombards, otto, assumed, the, titles, of, rex, italicorum, and, rex, langobardorum, in, his, acts, from, the, 10, october, onwards, like, charlemagne, before, him, otto, was, now, concurrent, king, of, germany, and, king, of, italy, otto, sent, a, message, to, his, brother, henry, in, bavaria, to, escort, his, bride, from, canossa, to, pavia, where, the, two, married, soon, after, his, father, s, marriage, in, pavia, liudolf, left, italy, and, returned, to, swabia, archbishop, frederick, of, mainz, the, primate, of, germany, and, otto, s, long, time, domestic, rival, also, returned, to, germany, alongside, liudolf, disturbances, in, northern, germany, forced, otto, to, return, with, the, majority, of, his, army, back, across, the, alps, in, 952, otto, did, leave, a, small, portion, of, his, army, behind, in, italy, and, appointed, his, son, in, law, conrad, duke, of, lorraine, as, his, regent, and, tasked, him, with, subduing, berengar, ii, in, a, weak, military, position, with, few, troops, otto, s, regent, in, italy, attempted, a, diplomatic, solution, and, opened, peace, negotiations, with, berengar, ii, conrad, recognized, that, a, military, confrontation, would, impose, great, costs, upon, germany, both, in, manpower, and, in, treasure, at, a, time, when, the, kingdom, was, facing, invasions, from, the, north, by, the, danes, and, from, the, east, by, the, slavs, and, hungarians, all, available, resources, were, required, north, of, the, alps, conrad, believed, that, a, client, state, relationship, with, italy, would, be, in, germany, s, best, interest, he, offered, a, peace, treaty, in, which, berengar, ii, would, remain, king, of, italy, on, the, condition, that, he, recognized, otto, as, his, overlord, berengar, ii, agreed, and, the, pair, traveled, north, to, meet, with, otto, to, seal, the, agreement, conrad, s, treaty, was, met, with, disdain, by, adelaide, and, henry, though, adelaide, was, burgundian, by, birth, she, was, raised, as, an, italian, her, father, rudolf, ii, of, burgundy, was, briefly, king, of, italy, prior, to, being, deposed, and, she, herself, had, briefly, been, queen, of, italy, until, her, husband, lothair, ii, of, italy, s, death, berengar, ii, imprisoned, her, when, she, refused, to, marry, his, son, adalbert, of, italy, henry, had, other, reasons, to, disapprove, of, the, peace, treaty, as, duke, of, bavaria, he, controlled, territory, on, the, northern, side, of, the, german, italian, border, henry, had, hope, that, with, berengar, ii, being, deposed, his, own, fiefdom, would, be, greatly, expanded, by, incorporating, territory, south, of, the, alps, conrad, and, henry, were, already, not, on, good, terms, and, the, proposed, treaty, drove, the, two, dukes, further, apart, adelaide, and, henry, conspired, together, to, persuade, otto, to, reject, conrad, s, treaty, conrad, and, berengar, ii, arrived, at, magdeburg, to, meet, otto, but, had, to, wait, three, days, before, an, audience, was, granted, this, was, a, humiliating, offense, for, the, man, otto, had, named, his, regent, though, adelaide, and, henry, urged, the, treaty, s, immediate, rejection, otto, referred, the, issue, to, an, imperial, diet, for, further, debate, appearing, before, the, diet, in, august, 952, in, augsburg, berengar, ii, and, his, son, adalbert, were, forced, to, swear, fealty, to, otto, as, his, vassals, in, return, otto, granted, berengar, ii, italy, as, his, fiefdom, and, restored, the, title, king, of, italy, to, him, the, italian, king, had, to, pay, an, enormous, annual, tribute, and, was, required, to, cede, the, duchy, of, friuli, south, of, the, alps, otto, reorganized, this, area, into, the, march, of, verona, and, put, it, under, henry, s, control, as, reward, for, his, loyalty, the, duchy, of, bavaria, therefore, grew, to, become, the, most, powerful, domain, in, germany, beginning, in, the, late, 940s, otto, rearranged, interior, policies, by, utilizing, the, offices, of, the, catholic, church, as, tools, of, royal, administration, thereby, setting, the, course, for, the, ottonian, imperial, church, system, with, regard, to, his, divine, right, to, rule, he, viewed, himself, as, the, protector, of, the, church, a, key, element, of, administrative, reorganisation, was, the, installment, of, celibate, clerics, in, secular, offices, chiefly, bishops, and, abbots, at, the, expense, of, the, hereditary, secular, nobility, otto, sought, to, establish, a, non, hereditary, counter, balance, to, the, fiercely, independent, and, powerful, royal, princes, he, granted, land, and, bestowed, the, title, of, prince, of, the, empire, reichsf, rst, to, appointed, bishops, and, abbots, hereditary, claims, were, thus, avoided, as, after, death, the, offices, fell, back, upon, the, crown, historian, norman, cantor, concludes, under, these, conditions, clerical, election, became, a, mere, formality, in, the, ottonian, empire, and, the, king, filled, up, the, ranks, of, the, episcopate, with, his, own, relatives, and, with, his, loyal, chancery, clerks, who, were, also, appointed, to, head, the, great, german, monasteries, the, most, prominent, member, of, this, blended, royal, ecclesiastical, service, was, his, own, brother, bruno, the, great, otto, s, chancellor, since, 940, who, was, appointed, archbishop, of, cologne, and, duke, of, lorraine, in, 953, other, important, religious, officials, within, otto, s, government, included, archbishop, william, of, mainz, otto, s, illegitimate, son, archbishop, adaldag, of, bremen, and, hadamar, the, abbot, of, fulda, otto, endowed, the, bishoprics, and, abbeys, of, his, kingdom, with, numerous, gifts, including, land, and, royal, prerogatives, such, as, the, power, to, levy, taxes, and, to, maintain, an, army, over, these, church, lands, secular, authorities, had, neither, the, power, of, taxation, nor, legal, jurisdiction, this, raised, the, church, above, the, various, dukes, and, committed, its, clerics, to, serve, as, the, king, s, personal, vassals, in, order, to, support, the, church, otto, made, tithing, mandatory, for, all, inhabitants, of, germany, otto, granted, the, various, bishops, and, abbots, of, the, kingdom, the, rank, of, count, as, well, as, the, legal, rights, of, counts, within, their, territory, because, otto, personally, appointed, all, bishops, and, abbots, these, reforms, strengthened, his, central, authority, and, the, upper, ranks, of, the, german, church, functioned, in, some, respect, as, an, arm, of, the, royal, bureaucracy, otto, routinely, appointed, his, personal, court, chaplains, to, bishoprics, throughout, the, kingdom, while, attached, to, the, royal, court, the, chaplains, would, perform, the, work, of, the, government, through, services, to, the, royal, chancery, after, years, within, the, royal, court, otto, would, reward, their, service, with, promotion, to, a, diocese, with, the, humiliating, failure, of, his, italian, campaign, and, otto, s, marriage, to, adelaide, liudolf, became, estranged, from, his, father, and, planned, a, rebellion, on, christmas, day, 951, he, held, a, grand, feast, at, saalfeld, that, was, attended, by, many, important, figures, from, across, the, kingdom, most, notably, archbishop, frederick, of, mainz, the, primate, of, germany, liudolf, was, able, to, recruit, his, brother, in, law, conrad, duke, of, lorraine, to, his, rebellion, as, otto, s, regent, in, italy, conrad, had, negotiated, a, peace, agreement, and, an, alliance, with, berengar, ii, and, believed, that, otto, would, confirm, this, treaty, instead, of, an, ally, berengar, ii, was, made, otto, s, subject, and, his, kingdom, was, subsequently, reduced, conrad, felt, betrayed, and, insulted, over, otto, s, decision, especially, with, the, additional, empowerment, of, henry, conrad, and, liudolf, viewed, otto, as, being, controlled, by, his, foreign, born, wife, and, power, hungry, brother, and, resolved, to, free, the, kingdom, from, their, domination, in, winter, 952, adelaide, gave, birth, to, a, son, whom, she, named, henry, after, her, brother, in, law, and, the, child, s, grandfather, henry, the, fowler, rumors, spread, that, otto, had, been, persuaded, by, his, wife, and, brother, to, propose, this, child, as, his, heir, instead, of, liudolf, for, many, german, nobles, this, rumor, represented, otto, s, final, transformation, from, a, policy, focused, on, germany, to, an, italian, centered, one, the, idea, that, otto, would, ask, them, to, revoke, the, succession, rights, of, liudolf, prompted, many, nobles, into, open, rebellion, liudolf, and, conrad, first, led, the, nobles, against, henry, the, duke, of, bavaria, in, spring, 953, henry, was, unpopular, with, the, bavarians, due, to, his, saxon, heritage, and, his, vassals, quickly, rebelled, against, him, word, of, the, rebellion, reached, otto, at, ingelheim, in, order, to, secure, his, position, he, traveled, to, his, stronghold, at, mainz, the, city, was, also, the, seat, of, archbishop, frederick, of, mainz, who, acted, as, mediator, between, otto, and, the, rebels, recorded, details, of, the, meeting, or, the, negotiated, treaty, do, not, exist, but, otto, soon, left, mainz, with, a, peace, treaty, favorable, to, the, conspirators, most, likely, confirming, liudolf, as, heir, apparent, and, approving, conrad, s, original, agreement, with, berengar, ii, these, terms, rendered, the, treaty, incompatible, with, the, wishes, of, adelaide, and, henry, when, otto, returned, to, saxony, adelaide, and, henry, persuaded, the, king, to, void, the, treaty, convening, the, imperial, diet, at, fritzlar, otto, declared, liudolf, and, conrad, as, outlaws, in, absentia, the, king, reasserted, his, desires, for, dominion, over, italy, and, to, claim, the, imperial, title, he, sent, emissaries, to, the, duchy, of, lorraine, and, stirred, the, local, nobles, against, conrad, s, rule, the, duke, was, a, salian, frank, by, birth, and, unpopular, with, the, people, of, lorraine, so, they, pledged, their, support, to, otto, otto, s, actions, at, the, diet, provoked, the, people, of, swabia, and, franconia, into, rebellion, after, initial, defeats, by, otto, liudolf, and, conrad, fell, back, to, their, headquarters, in, mainz, in, july, 953, otto, and, his, army, laid, siege, to, the, city, supported, by, henry, s, army, from, bavaria, after, two, months, of, siege, the, city, had, not, fallen, and, rebellions, against, otto, s, rule, grew, stronger, in, southern, germany, faced, with, these, challenges, otto, opened, peace, negotiations, with, liudolf, and, conrad, bruno, the, great, otto, s, youngest, brother, and, royal, chancellor, since, 940, accompanied, his, older, brothers, and, oversaw, the, arrangements, for, the, negotiations, as, the, newly, appointed, archbishop, of, cologne, bruno, was, eager, to, end, the, civil, war, in, lorraine, which, was, in, his, ecclesiastical, territory, the, rebels, demanded, ratification, of, the, treaty, they, had, previously, agreed, to, with, otto, but, henry, s, provocation, during, the, meeting, caused, the, negotiations, to, break, down, conrad, and, liudolf, left, the, meeting, to, continue, the, civil, war, angered, by, their, actions, otto, stripped, both, men, of, their, duchies, of, swabia, and, lorraine, and, appointed, his, brother, bruno, as, the, new, duke, of, lorraine, while, on, military, campaign, with, otto, henry, appointed, the, bavarian, count, palatine, arnulf, ii, to, govern, his, duchy, in, his, absence, arnulf, ii, was, a, son, of, arnulf, the, bad, whom, henry, had, previously, displaced, as, duke, and, he, sought, revenge, he, deserted, henry, and, joined, the, rebellion, against, otto, lifting, the, siege, of, mainz, otto, and, henry, marched, south, to, regain, control, over, bavaria, without, the, support, of, the, local, nobles, their, plan, failed, and, they, were, forced, to, retreat, to, saxony, the, duchies, of, bavaria, swabia, and, franconia, were, in, open, civil, war, against, the, king, and, even, in, his, native, duchy, of, saxony, revolts, began, to, spread, by, the, end, of, 953, the, civil, war, was, threatening, to, depose, otto, and, permanently, end, his, claims, to, be, charlemagne, s, successor, in, early, 954, margrave, hermann, billung, otto, s, long, time, loyal, vassal, in, saxony, was, facing, increased, slavic, movements, in, the, east, taking, advantage, of, the, german, civil, war, the, slavs, raided, deeper, and, deeper, into, the, adjacent, border, areas, meanwhile, the, hungarians, began, extensive, raids, into, southern, germany, though, liudolf, and, conrad, prepared, defenses, against, the, invasions, in, their, territories, the, hungarians, devastated, bavaria, and, franconia, on, palm, sunday, 954, liudolf, held, a, great, feast, at, worms, and, invited, the, hungarian, chieftains, to, join, him, there, he, presented, the, invaders, with, gifts, of, gold, and, silver, otto, s, brother, henry, soon, spread, rumors, that, conrad, and, liudolf, had, invited, the, hungarians, into, germany, in, hopes, of, using, them, against, otto, public, opinion, quickly, turned, against, the, rebels, in, these, duchies, with, this, change, in, opinion, and, the, death, of, his, wife, liutgarde, otto, s, only, daughter, conrad, began, peace, negotiations, with, otto, which, were, eventually, joined, by, liudolf, and, archbishop, frederick, a, truce, was, declared, and, otto, called, a, meeting, of, the, imperial, diet, on, 15, june, 954,
