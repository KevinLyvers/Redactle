nikolai, ivanovich, lobachevsky, russian, ipa, 1, december, 1792, 24, february, 1856, was, a, russian, mathematician, and, geometer, known, primarily, for, his, work, on, hyperbolic, geometry, otherwise, known, as, lobachevskian, geometry, and, also, for, his, fundamental, study, on, dirichlet, integrals, known, as, the, lobachevsky, integral, formula, william, kingdon, clifford, called, lobachevsky, the, copernicus, of, geometry, due, to, the, revolutionary, character, of, his, work, nikolai, lobachevsky, was, born, either, in, or, near, the, city, of, nizhny, novgorod, in, the, russian, empire, now, in, nizhny, novgorod, oblast, russia, in, 1792, to, parents, of, russian, and, polish, origin, ivan, maksimovich, lobachevsky, and, praskovia, alexandrovna, lobachevskaya, he, was, one, of, three, children, when, he, was, seven, his, father, a, clerk, in, a, land, surveying, office, died, and, nikolai, moved, with, his, mother, to, kazan, nikolai, lobachevsky, attended, kazan, gymnasium, from, 1802, graduating, in, 1807, and, then, received, a, scholarship, to, kazan, university, which, had, been, founded, just, three, years, earlier, in, 1804, at, kazan, university, lobachevsky, was, influenced, by, professor, johann, christian, martin, bartels, a, former, teacher, and, friend, of, the, german, mathematician, carl, friedrich, gauss, 1777, 1855, lobachevsky, received, a, master, of, science, in, physics, and, mathematics, in, 1811, in, 1814, he, became, a, lecturer, at, kazan, university, in, 1816, he, was, promoted, to, associate, professor, in, 1822, at, the, age, of, 30, he, became, a, full, professor, teaching, mathematics, physics, and, astronomy, he, served, in, many, administrative, positions, and, became, the, rector, of, kazan, university, in, 1827, in, 1832, he, married, varvara, alexeyevna, moiseyeva, they, had, a, large, number, of, children, eighteen, according, to, his, son, s, memoirs, though, only, seven, apparently, survived, into, adulthood, he, was, dismissed, from, the, university, in, 1846, ostensibly, due, to, his, deteriorating, health, by, the, early, 1850s, he, was, nearly, blind, and, unable, to, walk, he, died, in, poverty, in, 1856, and, was, buried, in, arskoe, cemetery, kazan, in, 1811, in, his, student, days, lobachevsky, was, accused, by, a, vengeful, supervisor, of, atheism, russian, lit, signs, of, godlessness, lobachevsky, s, main, achievement, is, the, development, independently, from, j, nos, bolyai, of, a, non, euclidean, geometry, also, referred, to, as, lobachevskian, geometry, before, him, mathematicians, were, trying, to, deduce, euclid, s, fifth, postulate, from, other, axioms, euclid, s, fifth, is, a, rule, in, euclidean, geometry, which, states, in, john, playfair, s, reformulation, that, for, any, given, line, and, point, not, on, the, line, there, is, only, one, line, through, the, point, not, intersecting, the, given, line, lobachevsky, would, instead, develop, a, geometry, in, which, the, fifth, postulate, was, not, true, this, idea, was, first, reported, on, february, 23, feb, 11, o, s, 1826, to, the, session, of, the, department, of, physics, and, mathematics, and, this, research, was, printed, in, the, periodical, kazan, university, course, notes, as, on, the, origin, of, geometry, between, 1829, and, 1830, in, 1829, lobachevsky, wrote, a, paper, about, his, ideas, called, a, concise, outline, of, the, foundations, of, geometry, that, was, published, by, the, kazan, messenger, but, was, rejected, when, it, was, submitted, to, the, st, petersburg, academy, of, sciences, for, publication, the, non, euclidean, geometry, that, lobachevsky, developed, is, referred, to, as, hyperbolic, geometry, lobachevsky, replaced, playfair, s, axiom, with, the, statement, that, for, any, given, point, there, exists, more, than, one, line, that, can, be, extended, through, that, point, and, run, parallel, to, another, line, of, which, that, point, is, not, part, he, developed, the, angle, of, parallelism, which, depends, on, the, distance, the, point, is, off, the, given, line, in, hyperbolic, geometry, the, sum, of, angles, in, a, hyperbolic, triangle, must, be, less, than, 180, degrees, non, euclidean, geometry, stimulated, the, development, of, differential, geometry, which, has, many, applications, hyperbolic, geometry, is, frequently, referred, to, as, lobachevskian, geometry, or, bolyai, lobachevskian, geometry, some, mathematicians, and, historians, have, wrongly, claimed, that, lobachevsky, in, his, studies, in, non, euclidean, geometry, was, influenced, by, gauss, which, is, untrue, gauss, himself, appreciated, lobachevsky, s, published, works, highly, but, they, never, had, personal, correspondence, between, them, prior, to, the, publication, although, three, people, gauss, lobachevsky, and, bolyai, can, be, credited, with, discovery, of, hyperbolic, geometry, gauss, never, published, his, ideas, and, lobachevsky, was, the, first, to, present, his, views, to, the, world, mathematical, community, lobachevsky, s, magnum, opus, geometriya, was, completed, in, 1823, but, was, not, published, in, its, exact, original, form, until, 1909, long, after, he, had, died, lobachevsky, was, also, the, author, of, new, foundations, of, geometry, 1835, 1838, he, also, wrote, geometrical, investigations, on, the, theory, of, parallels, 1840, and, pangeometry, 1855, another, of, lobachevsky, s, achievements, was, developing, a, method, for, the, approximation, of, the, roots, of, algebraic, equations, this, method, is, now, known, as, the, dandelin, gr, ffe, method, named, after, two, other, mathematicians, who, discovered, it, independently, in, russia, it, is, called, the, lobachevsky, method, lobachevsky, gave, the, definition, of, a, function, as, a, correspondence, between, two, sets, of, real, numbers, peter, gustav, lejeune, dirichlet, gave, the, same, definition, independently, soon, after, lobachevsky, e, t, bell, wrote, about, lobachevsky, s, influence, on, the, following, development, of, mathematics, in, his, 1937, book, men, of, mathematics, the, boldness, of, his, challenge, and, its, successful, outcome, have, inspired, mathematicians, and, scientists, in, general, to, challenge, other, axioms, or, accepted, truths, for, example, the, law, of, causality, which, for, centuries, have, seemed, as, necessary, to, straight, thinking, as, euclid, s, postulate, appeared, until, lobachevsky, discarded, it, the, full, impact, of, the, lobachevskian, method, of, challenging, axioms, has, probably, yet, to, be, felt, it, is, no, exaggeration, to, call, lobachevsky, the, copernicus, of, geometry, for, geometry, is, only, a, part, of, the, vaster, domain, which, he, renovated, it, might, even, be, just, to, designate, him, as, a, copernicus, of, all, thought, a, fictional, mathematician, named, lobachevsky, is, the, subject, of, songwriter, mathematician, tom, lehrer, s, humorous, song, lobachevsky, from, his, 1953, songs, by, tom, lehrer, album, in, the, song, lehrer, portrays, a, russian, mathematician, who, sings, about, how, lobachevsky, influenced, him, and, who, made, me, a, big, success, and, brought, me, wealth, and, fame, nikolai, ivanovich, lobachevsky, is, his, name, lobachevsky, s, secret, to, mathematical, success, is, given, as, plagiarize, as, long, as, one, is, always, careful, to, call, it, please, research, according, to, lehrer, the, song, is, not, intended, as, a, slur, on, character, and, the, name, was, chosen, solely, for, prosodic, reasons, in, poul, anderson, s, 1969, fantasy, novella, operation, changeling, which, was, later, expanded, into, the, novel, operation, chaos, 1971, a, group, of, sorcerers, navigate, a, non, euclidean, universe, with, the, assistance, of, the, ghosts, of, lobachevsky, and, bolyai, roger, zelazny, s, science, fiction, novel, doorways, in, the, sand, contains, a, poem,
