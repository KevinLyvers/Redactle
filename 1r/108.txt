and, impressionist, painters, in, the, 20th, century, artists, such, as, pablo, picasso, salvador, dal, and, francis, bacon, paid, tribute, to, vel, zquez, by, re, interpreting, some, of, his, most, iconic, images, most, of, his, work, entered, the, spanish, royal, collection, and, by, far, the, best, collection, is, in, the, museo, del, prado, in, madrid, although, some, portraits, were, sent,

from, the, lesser, nobility, in, order, to, qualify, however, his, grandparents, may, have, been, tradespeople, some, authors, have, suggested, that, his, grandparents, were, jewish, conversos, rafael, c, mez, proposes, vel, zquez, may, have, had, morisco, lineage, raised, in, modest, circumstances, he, showed, an, early, gift, for, art, and, was, apprenticed, to, francisco, pacheco, an, artist, and, teacher, in, seville, an, early, 18th, century, biographer, antonio, palomino, said, vel, zquez, studied, for, a, short, time, under, francisco, de, herrera, before, beginning, his, apprenticeship, under, pacheco, but, this, is, undocumented, a, contract, signed, on, 17, september, 1611, formalized, a, six, year, apprenticeship, with, pacheco, backdated, to, december, 1610, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, herrera, may, have, substituted, for, a, traveling, pacheco, between, december, 1610, and, september, 1611, although, considered, a, dull, and, undistinguished, painter, pacheco, sometimes, expressed, a, simple, direct, realism, though, his, work, remained, essentially, mannerist, as, a, teacher, he, was, highly, learned, and, encouraged, his, students, intellectual, development, in, pacheco, s, school, vel, zquez, studied, the, classics, was, trained, in, proportion, and, perspective, and, witnessed, the, trends, in, the, literary, and, artistic, circles, of, seville, on, 23, april, 1618, vel, zquez, married, juana, pacheco, 1, june, 1602, 10, august, 1660, the, daughter, of, his, teacher, they, had, two, daughters, the, elder, francisca, de,

vel, zquez, y, pacheco, born, in, 1621, died, in, infancy, vel, zquez, s, earliest, works, are, bodegones, kitchen, scenes, with, prominent, still, life, he, was, one, of, the, first, spanish, artists, to, paint, such, scenes, and, his, old, woman, frying, eggs, 1618, demonstrates, the, young, artist, s, unusual, skill, in, realistic, depiction, the, realism, and, dramatic, lighting, of, this, work, may, have, been, influenced, by, caravaggio, s, work, which, vel, zquez, could, have, seen, second, hand, in, copies, and, by, the, polychrome, sculpture, in, sevillian, churches, two, of, his, bodegones, kitchen, scene, with, christ, in, the, house, of, martha, 1618, and, kitchen, scene, with, christ, at, emmaus, c, 1618, feature, religious, scenes, in, the, background, painted, in, a, way, that, creates, ambiguity, as, to, whether, the, religious, scene, is, a, painting, on, the, wall, a, representation, of, the, thoughts, of, the, kitchen, maid, in, the, foreground, or, an, actual, incident, seen, through, a, window, the, virgin, of, the, immaculate, conception, 1618, 19, follows, a, formula, used, by, pacheco, but, replaces, the, idealized, facial, type, and, smoothly, finished, surfaces, of, his, teacher, with, the, face, of, a, local, girl, and, varied, brushwork, his, other, religious, works, include, the, adoration, of, the, magi, 1619, and, saint, john, the, evangelist, on, the, island, of, patmos, 1618, 19, both, of, which, begin, to, express, his, more, pointed, and, careful, realism, also, from, this, period, are, the, portrait, of, sor, jer, nima, de, la, fuente, 1620, vel, zquez, s, first, full, length, portrait, and, the, genre, the, water, seller, of, seville, 1618, 1622, the, water, seller, of, seville, has, been, termed, the, peak, of, vel, zquez, s, bodegones, and, is, admired, for, its, virtuoso, rendering, of, volumes, and, textures, as, well, as, for, its, enigmatic, gravitas, vel, zquez, had, established, his, reputation, in, seville, by, the, early, 1620s, he, traveled, to, madrid, in, april, 1622, with, letters, of, introduction, to, don, juan, de, fonseca, chaplain, to, the, king, vel, zquez, was, not, allowed, to,

gold, to, defray, his, expenses, and, he, was, accompanied, by, his, father, in, law, fonseca, lodged, the, young, painter, in, his, home, and, sat, for, a, portrait, which, when, completed, was, conveyed, to, the, royal, palace, a, portrait, of, the, king, was, commissioned, and, on, 30, august, 1623, philip, iv, sat, for, vel, zquez, the, portrait, pleased, the, king, and, olivares,

circulation, in, the, following, year, 1624, he, received, 300, ducats, from, the, king, to, pay, the, cost, of, moving, his, family, to, madrid, which, became, his, home, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, vel, zquez, secured, admission, to, the, royal, service, with, a, salary, of, 20, ducats, per, month, lodgings, and, payment, for, the, pictures, he, might, paint, his, portrait, of, philip, was, exhibited, on, the, steps, of, san, felipe, and, received, with, enthusiasm, it, is, now, lost, as, is, the, portrait, of, fonseca, the, museo, del, prado, however, has, two, of, vel, zquez, s, portraits, of, the, king, nos, 1070, and, 1071, in, which, the, severity, of, the, seville, period, has, disappeared, and, the, tones, are, more, delicate, the, modeling, is, firm, recalling, that, of, antonio, mor, the, dutch, portrait, painter, of, philip, ii, who, exercised, a, considerable, influence, on, the, spanish, school, vel, zquez, depicts, philip, wearing, the, golilla, es, a, stiff, linen, collar, projecting, at, right, angles, from, the, neck, the, golilla, replaced, the, earlier, court, fashion, of, elaborate, ruffed, collars, as, part, of, philip, s, dress, reform, laws, during, a, period, of, economic, crisis, the, prince, of, wales, afterwards, charles, i, arrived, at, the, court, of, spain, in, 1623, records, indicate, that, he, sat, for, vel, zquez, but, the, picture, is, now, lost, in, 1627, philip, set, a, competition, for, the, best, painters, of, spain, with, the, subject, to, be, the, expulsion, of, the, moors, vel, zquez, won, with, a, painting, destroyed, in, a, fire, at, the, palace, in, 1734, which, records, say, depicted, philip, iii, pointing, with, his, baton, to, a, crowd, of, men, and, women, being, led, away, by, soldiers, while, the, female, personification, of, spain, sits, in, calm, repose, vel, zquez, was, appointed, gentleman, usher, as, reward, later, he, also, received, a, daily, allowance, of, 12, r, is, the, same, amount, allotted, to, the, court, barbers, and, 90, ducats, a, year, for, dress, in, september, 1628, peter, paul, rubens, was, positioned, in, madrid, as, an, emissary, from, the, infanta, isabella, and, vel, zquez, accompanied, him, to, view, the, titians, at, the, escorial, rubens, who, demonstrated, his, brilliance, as, painter, and, courtier, during, the, seven, months, of, the, diplomatic, mission, had, a, high, opinion, of, vel, zquez, but, had, no, significant, influence, on, his, painting, he, did, however, galvanize, vel, zquez, s, desire, to, see, italy, and, the, works, of, the, great, italian, masters, in, 1629, vel, zquez, received, 100, ducats, for, the, picture, of, bacchus, the, triumph, of, bacchus, also, called, los, borrachos, the, drunks, a, painting, of, a, group, of, men, in, contemporary, dress, paying, homage, to, a, half, naked, ivy, crowned, young, man, seated, on, a, wine, barrel, vel, zquez, s, first, mythological, painting, it, has, been, interpreted, variously, as, a, depiction, of, a, theatrical, performance, as, a, parody, or, as, a, symbolic, representation, of, peasants, asking, the, god, of, wine, to, give, them, relief, from, their, sorrows, the, style, shows, the, naturalism, of, vel, zquez, s, early, works, slightly, touched, by, the, influence, of, titian, and, rubens, in, 1629, vel, zquez, was, given, permission, to, spend, a, year, and, a, half, in, italy, although, this, first, visit, is, recognized, as, a, crucial, chapter, in, the, development, of, his, style, and, in, the, history, of, spanish, royal, patronage, since, philip, iv, sponsored, his, trip, few, details, and, specifics, are, known, of, what, the, painter, saw, whom, he, met, how, he, was, perceived, and, what, innovations, he, hoped, to, introduce, into, his, painting, he, traveled, to, venice, ferrara, cento, loreto, bologna, and, rome, in, 1630, he, visited, naples, to, paint, the, portrait, of, maria, anna, of, spain, and, there, he, probably, met, ribera, the, major, works, from, his, first, italian, period, are, joseph, s, bloody, coat, brought, to, jacob, 1629, 30, and, apollo, in, the, forge, of, vulcan, 1630, both, of, which, reveal, his, ambition, to, rival, the, italians, as, a, history, painter, in, the, grand, manner, the, two, compositions, of, several, nearly, life, sized, figures, have, similar, dimensions, and, may, have, been, conceived, as, pendants, the, biblical, scene, depicting, a, deception, and, the, mythological, scene, depicting, the, revelation, of, a, deception, as, he, had, done, in, the, triumph, of, bacchus, vel, zquez, presented, his, characters, as, contemporary, people, whose, gestures, and, facial, expressions, were, those, of, everyday, life, following, the, example, of, bolognese, painters, such, as, guido, reni, vel, zquez, painted, apollo, in, the, forge, of, vulcan, on, canvas, prepared, with, a, light, gray, ground, rather, than, the, dark, reddish, ground, of, all, his, earlier, works, the, change, resulted, in, a, greater, luminosity, than, he, had, previously, achieved, and, he, made, the, use, of, light, gray, grounds, his, regular, practice, vel, zquez, returned, to, madrid, in, january, 1631, that, year, he, completed, the, first, of, his, many, portraits, of, the, young, prince, beginning, with, prince, balthasar, charles, with, a, dwarf, boston, museum, of, fine, arts, ln, portraits, such, as, equestrian, portrait, of, prince, balthasar, charles, 1635, vel, zquez, depicts, the, prince, looking, dignified, and, lordly, or, in, the, dress, of, a, field, marshal, on, his, prancing, steed, in, one, version, the, scene, is, in, the, riding, school, of, the, palace, the, king, and, queen, looking, on, from, a, balcony, while, olivares, attends, as, master, of, the, horse, to, the, prince, to, decorate, the, king, s, new, palace, the, palacio, del, buen, retiro, vel, zquez, painted, equestrian, portraits, of, the, royal, family, in, philip, iv, on, horseback, 1634, 35, the, king, is, represented, in, profile, in, an, image, of, imperturbable, majesty, demonstrating, expert, horsemanship, by, executing, an, effortless, levade, the, large, the, surrender, of, breda, 1634, 35, also, painted, for, the, palacio, is, vel, zquez, s, only, extant, painting, depicting, contemporary, history, its, symbolic, treatment, of, a, spanish, military, victory, over, the, dutch, eschews, the, rhetoric, of, conquest, and, superiority, that, is, typical, in, such, scenes, in, which, a, general, on, horseback, looks, down, on, his, vanquished, kneeling, opponent, instead, vel, zquez, shows, the, spanish, general, standing, before, his, dutch, counterpart, as, an, equal, and, extending, to, him, a, hand, of, consolation, the, impassive, saturnine, face, of, the, influential, minister, olivares, is, familiar, to, us, from, the, many, portraits, painted, by, vel, zquez, two, are, notable, one, is, full, length, stately, and, dignified, in, which, he, wears, the, green, cross, of, the, order, of, alcantara, and, holds, a, wand, the, badge, of, his, office, as, master, of, the, horse, in, the, other, the, count, duke, of, olivares, on, horseback, c, 1635, he, is, flatteringly, represented, as, a, field, marshal, during, action, in, these, portraits, vel, zquez, well, repaid, the, debt, of, gratitude, that, he, owed, to, the, patron, who, had, first, brought, him, to, the, king, s, attention, the, sculptor, juan, mart, nez, monta, s, modeled, a, statue, on, one, of, vel, zquez, s, equestrian, portraits, of, the, king, painted, in, 1636, now, lost, which, was, cast, in, bronze, by, the, florentine, sculptor, pietro, tacca, and, now, stands, in, the, plaza, de, oriente, in, madrid, vel, zquez, was, in, close, attendance, to, philip, and, accompanied, him, to, aragon, in, 1644, where, the, artist, painted, a, portrait, of, the, monarch, in, the, costume, as, he, reviewed, his, troops, in, fraga, vel, zquez, s, paintings, of, aesop, and, menippus, both, c, 1636, 1638, portray, ancient, writers, in, the, guise, of, portraits, of, beggars, mars, resting, c, 1638, is, both, a, depiction, of, a, mythological, figure, and, a, portrait, of, a, weary, looking, middle, aged, man, posing, as, mars, the, model, is, painted, with, attention, to, his, individuality, while, his, unkempt, oversized, mustache, is, a, faintly, comic, incongruity, the, equivocal, image, has, been, interpreted, in, various, ways, javier, port, s, describes, it, as, a, reflection, on, reality, representation, and, the, artistic, vision, while, alfonso, e, p, rez, s, nchez, says, it, has, also, been, seen, as, a, melancholy, meditation, on, the, arms, of, spain, in, decline, had, it, not, been, for, his, royal, appointment, which, enabled, vel, zquez, to, escape, the, censorship, of, the, inquisition, he, would, not, have, been, able, to, release, his, la, venus, del, espejo, c, 1644, 1648, english, venus, at, her, mirror, also, known, as, the, rokeby, venus, it, is, the, first, known, female, nude, painted, by, a, spanish, artist, and, the, only, surviving, female, nude, by, vel, zquez, besides, the, many, portraits, of, philip, by, vel, zquez, thirty, four, by, one, count, he, painted, portraits, of, other, members, of, the, royal, family, philip, s, first, wife, elisabeth, of, bourbon, and, her, children, especially, her, eldest, son, don, baltasar, carlos, whom, vel, zquez, first, depicted, at, about, two, years, of, age, cavaliers, soldiers, churchmen, and, the, poet, francisco, de, quevedo, now, at, apsley, house, sat, for, vel, zquez, vel, zquez, also, painted, several, buffoons, and, dwarfs, in, philip, s, court, whom, he, depicted, sympathetically, and, with, respect, for, their, individuality, as, in, the, jester, don, diego, de, acedo, 1644, whose, intelligent, face, and, huge, folio, with, ink, bottle, and, pen, by, his, side, show, him, to, be, a, wise, and, well, educated, man, pablo, de, valladolid, 1635, a, buffoon, evidently, acting, a, part, and, the, buffoon, of, coria, 1639, belong, to, this, middle, period, as, court, painter, vel, zquez, had, fewer,

at, this, point, in, time, was, a, slave, and, who, had, been, trained, in, painting, by, vel, zquez, vel, zquez, sailed, from, m, laga, landed, at, genoa, and, proceeded, from, milan, to, venice,

third, and, latest, manner, a, noble, example, of, which, is, the, great, portrait, of, pope, innocent, x, in, the, doria, pamphilj, gallery, in, rome, where, vel, zquez, now, proceeded, there, he, was, received, with, marked, favor, by, the, pope, who, presented, him, with, a, medal, and, golden, chain, vel, zquez, took, a, copy, of, the, portrait, which, sir, joshua, reynolds, thought, was, the, finest, picture, in, rome, with, him, to, spain, several, copies, of, it, exist, in, different, galleries, some, of, them, possibly, studies, for, the, original, or, replicas, painted, for, philip, vel, zquez, in, this, work, had, now, reached, the, manera, abreviada, a, term, coined, by, contemporary, spaniards, for, this, bolder, sharper, style, the, portrait, shows, such, ruthlessness, in, innocent, s, expression, that, some, in, the, vatican, feared, that, it, would, be, seen, unfavorably, by, the, pope, in, fact, innocent, was, pleased, with, the, work, and, hung, it, in, his, official, visitor, s, waiting, room, in, 1650, in, rome, vel, zquez, also, painted, a, portrait, of, juan, de, pareja, now, in, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, city, us, this, portrait, procured, his, election, into, the, accademia, di, san, luca, purportedly, vel, zquez, created, this, portrait, as, a, warm, up, of, his, skills, before, his, portrait, of, the, pope, it, captures, in, great, detail, pareja, s, countenance, and, his, somewhat, worn, and, patched, clothing, with, an, economic, use, of, brushwork, in, november, 1650, juan, de, pareja, was, freed, from, slavery, by, vel, zquez, to, this, period, also, belong, two, small, landscape, paintings, both, titled, view, of, the, garden, of, the, villa, medici, as, landscapes, apparently, painted, directly, from, nature, they, were, exceptional, for, their, time, and, reveal, vel, zquez, s, close, study, of, light, at, different, times, of, day, as, part, of, his, mission, to, procure, decorations, for, the, room, of, mirrors, at, the, royal, alcazar, of, madrid, vel, zquez, commissioned, matteo, bonuccelli, to, cast, twelve, bronze, copies, of, the, medici, lions, the, copies, are, now, in, the, royal, palace, of, madrid, and, the, museo, del, prado, during, his, time, in, rome, vel, zquez, fathered, a, natural, son, antonio, whom, he, is, not, known, ever, to, have, seen, from, february, 1650, philip, repeatedly, sought, vel, zquez, s, return, to, spain, accordingly, after, visiting, naples, where, he, saw, his, old, friend, jose, ribera, and, venice, vel, zquez, returned, to, spain, via, barcelona, in, 1651, taking, with, him, many, pictures, and, 300, pieces, of, statuary, which, afterwards, were, arranged, and, catalogued, for, the, king, elisabeth, of, france, had, died, in, 1644, and, the, king, had, married, mariana, of, austria, whom, vel, zquez, now, painted, in, many, attitudes, in, 1652, he, was, specially, chosen, by, the, king, to, fill, the, high, office, of, aposentador, mayor, which, imposed, on, him, the, duty, of, looking, after, the, quarters, occupied, by, the, court, a, responsible, function, which, was, no, sinecure, and, one, which, interfered, with, the, exercise, of, his, art, yet, far, from, indicating, any, decline, his, works, of, this, period, are, amongst, the, highest, examples, of, his, style, one, of, the, infantas, margaret, theresa, the, eldest, daughter, of, the, new, queen, appears, to, be, the, subject, of, las, meninas, 1656, english, the, maids, of, honour, vel, zquez, s, magnum, opus, created, four, years, before, his, death, it, serves, as, an, outstanding, example, of, european, baroque, art, luca, giordano, a, contemporary, italian, painter, referred, to, it, as, the, theology, of, painting, and, in, 1827, the, president, of, the, royal, academy, of, arts, sir, thomas, lawrence, described, it, in, a, letter, as, the, true, philosophy, of, the, art, however, it, is, unclear, as, to, who, or, what, is, the, true, subject, of, the, picture, is, it, the, royal, daughter, or, perhaps, the, painter, himself, the, king, and, queen, are, seen, reflected, in, a, mirror, on, the, back, wall, but, the, source, of, the, reflection, is, a, mystery, are, the, royal, pair, standing, in, the, viewer, s, space, or, does, the, mirror, reflect, the, painting, on, which, vel, zquez, is, working, dale, brown, says, vel, zquez, may, have, conceived, the, faded, image, of, the, king, and, queen, on, the, back, wall, as, a, foreshadowing, of, the, fall, of, the, spanish, empire, that, was, to, gain, momentum, following, philip, s, death, in, the, 1966, book, les, mots, et, les, choses, the, order, of, things, philosopher, michel, foucault, devotes, the, opening, chapter, to, a, detailed, analysis, of, las, meninas, he, describes, the, ways, in, which, the, painting, problematizes, issues, of, representation, through, its, use, of, mirrors, screens, and, the, subsequent, oscillations, that, occur, between, the, image, s, interior, surface, and, exterior, it, is, said, the, king, painted, the, honorary, cross, of, saint, james, of, the, order, of, santiago, on, the, breast, of, the, painter, as, it, appears, today, on, the, canvas, however, vel, zquez, did, not, receive, this, honor, of, knighthood, until, three, years, after, execution, of, this, painting, even, the, king, of, spain, could, not, make, his, favorite, court, painter, a, belted, knight, without, the, consent, of, the, commission, established, to, inquire, into, the, purity, of, his, lineage, the, aim, of, these, inquiries, would, be, to, prevent, the, appointment, to, positions, of, anyone, found, to, have, even, a, taint, of, heresy, in, their, lineage, that, is, a, trace, of, jewish, or, moorish, blood, or, contamination, by, trade, or, commerce, in, either, side, of, the, family, for, many, generations, the, records, of, this, commission, have, been, found, among, the, archives, of, the, order, of, santiago, vel, zquez, was, awarded, the, honor, in, 1659, his, occupation, as, plebeian, and, tradesman, was, justified, because, as, painter, to, the, king, he, was, evidently, not, involved, in, the, practice, of, selling, pictures, there, were, essentially, only, two, patrons, of, art, in, spain, the, church, and, the, art, loving, king, and, court, bartolom, esteban, murillo, who, toiled, for, a, rich, and, powerful, church, left, little, means, to, pay, for, his, burial, while, vel, zquez, lived, and, died, in, the, enjoyment, of, a, good, salary, and, pension, one, of, his, final, works, was, las, hilanderas, the, spinners, painted, circa, 1657, a, depiction, of, ovid, s, fable, of, arachne, the, tapestry, in, the, background, is, based, on, titian, s, the, rape, of, europa, or, more, probably, the, copy, that, rubens, painted, in, madrid, it, is, full, of, light, air, and, movement, featuring, vibrant, colors, and, careful, handling, anton, raphael, mengs, said, this, work, seemed, to, have, been, painted, not, by, the, hand, but, by, the, pure, force, of, will, it, displays, a, concentration, of, all, the, art, knowledge, vel, zquez, had, gathered, during, his, long, artistic, career, of, more, than, forty, years, the, scheme, is, simple, a, confluence, of, varied, and, blended, red, bluish, green, gray, and, black, vel, zquez, s, final, portraits, of, the, royal, children, are, among, his, finest, works, and, in, the, infanta, margarita, teresa, in, a, blue, dress, the, painter, s, personal, style, reached, its, high, point, shimmering, spots, of, color, on, wide, painting, surfaces, produce, an, almost, impressionistic, effect, the, viewer, must, stand, at, a, suitable, distance, to, get, the, impression, of, complete, three, dimensional, spatiality, his, only, surviving, portrait, of, the, delicate, and, sickly, prince, felipe, prospero, is, remarkable, for, its, combination, of, the, sweet, features, of, the, child, prince, and, his, dog, with, a, subtle, sense, of, gloom, the, hope, that, was, placed, at, that, time, in, the, sole, heir, to, the, spanish, crown, is, reflected, in, the, depiction, fresh, red, and, white, stand, in, contrast, to, late, autumnal, morbid, colors, a, small, dog, with, wide, eyes, looks, at, the, viewer, as, if, questioningly, and, the, largely, pale, background, hints, at, a, gloomy, fate, the, little, prince, was, barely, four, years, old, when, he, died, as, in, all, of, the, artist, s, late, paintings, the, handling, of, the, colors, is, extraordinarily, fluid, and, vibrant, in, 1660, a, peace, treaty, between, france, and, spain, was, consummated, by, the, marriage, of, maria, theresa, with, louis, xiv, and, the, ceremony, took, place, on, the, island, of, pheasants, a, small, swampy, island, in, the, bidassoa, vel, zquez, was, charged, with, the, decoration, of, the, spanish, pavilion, and, with, the, entire, scenic, display, he, attracted, much, attention, from, the, nobility, of, his, bearing, and, the, splendor, of, his, costume, on, 26, june, he, returned, to, madrid, and, on, 31, july, he, was, stricken, with, fever, feeling, his, end, approaching, he, signed, his, will, appointing, as, his, sole, executors, his, wife, and, his, firm, friend, named, fuensalida, keeper, of, the, royal, records, he, died, on, 6, august, 1660, he, was, buried, in, the, fuensalida, vault, of, the, church, of, san, juan, bautista, and, within, eight, days, his, wife, juana, was, buried, beside, him, this, church, was, destroyed, by, the, french, around, 1809, so, his, place, of, interment, is, now, unknown, there, was, much, difficulty, in, adjusting, the, tangled, accounts, outstanding, between, vel, zquez, and, the, treasury, and, it, was, not, until, 1666, after, the, death, of, king, philip, that, they, were, finally, settled, it, is, canonical, to, divide, vel, zquez, s, career, by, his, two, visits, to, italy, he, rarely, signed, his, pictures, and, the, royal, archives, give, the, dates, of, only, his, most, important, works, internal, evidence, and, history, pertaining, to, his, portraits, supply, the, rest, to, a, certain, extent, although, acquainted, with, all, the, italian, schools, and, a, friend, of, the, foremost, painters, of, his, day, vel, zquez, was, strong, enough, to, withstand, external, influences, and, work, out, for, himself, the, development, of, his, own, nature, and, his, own, principles, of, art, he, rejected, the, pomp, that, characterized, the, portraiture, of, other, european, courts, and, instead, brought, an, even, greater, reserve, to, the, understated, formula, for, habsburg, portraiture, established, by, titian, antonio, mor, and, alonso, s, nchez, coello, he, is, known, for, using, a, rather, limited, palette, but, he, mixed, the, available, paints, with, great, skill, to, achieve, varying, hues, his, pigments, were, not, significantly, different, from, those, of, his, contemporaries, and, he, mainly, employed, azurite, smalt, vermilion, red, lake, lead, tin, yellow, and, ochres, his, early, works, were, painted, on, canvases, prepared, with, a, red, brown, ground, he, adopted, the, use, of, light, gray, grounds, during, his, first, trip, to, italy, and, continued, using, them, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, change, resulted, in, paintings, with, greater, luminosity, and, a, generally, cool, silvery, range, of, color, few, drawings, are, securely, attributed, to, vel, zquez, although, preparatory, drawings, for, some, of, his, paintings, exist, his, method, was, to, paint, directly, from, life, and, x, rays, of, his, paintings, reveal, that, he, frequently, made, changes, in, his, composition, as, a, painting, progressed, vel, zquez, was, not, prolific, he, is, estimated, to, have, produced, between, 110, and, 120, known, canvases, he, produced, no, etchings, or, engravings, and, only, a, few, drawings, are, attributed, to, him, vel, zquez, is, the, most, influential, figure, in, the, history, of, spanish, portraiture, although, he, had, few, immediate, followers, spanish, court, painters, such, as, his, son, in, law, juan, bautista, martinez, del, mazo, and, juan, carre, o, de, miranda, took, inspiration, from, his, work, mazo, closely, mimicked, his, style, and, many, paintings, and, copies, by, mazo, were, formerly, attributed, to, vel, zquez, vel, zquez, s, reputation, languished, in, the, eighteenth, century, when, spanish, court, portraiture, was, dominated, by, artists, of, foreign, birth, and, training, towards, the, end, of, the, century, his, importance, was, increasingly, recognized, by, intellectuals, close, to, the, spanish, court, an, essay, published, in, 1781, by, gaspar, melchor, de, jovellanos, said, of, vel, zquez, that, when, he, died, the, glory, of, painting, in, spain, died, with, him, in, 1778, goya, made, a, set, of, etchings, after, paintings, by, vel, zquez, as, part, of, a, project, by, the, count, of, floridablanca, to, produce, prints, of, paintings, in, the, royal, collection, goya, s, free, copies, reveal, a, searching, engagement, with, the, older, master, s, work, which, remained, a, model, for, goya, for, the, rest, of, his, career, vel, zquez, s, work, was, little, known, outside, of, spain, until, the, nineteenth, century, his, paintings, mostly, escaped, being, stolen, by, the, french, marshals, during, the, peninsular, war, in, 1828, sir, david, wilkie, wrote, from, madrid, that, he, felt, himself, in, the, presence, of, a, new, power, in, art, as, he, looked, at, the, works, of, vel, zquez, and, at, the, same, time, found, a, wonderful, affinity, between, this, artist, and, the, british, school, of, portrait, painters, especially, henry, raeburn, he, was, struck, by, the, sparkle, and, vivacity, pervading, vel, zquez, s, works, vel, zquez, is, often, cited, as, a, key, influence, on, the, art, of, douard, manet, who, is, often, considered, the, bridge, between, realism, and, impressionism, calling, vel, zquez, the, painter, of, painters, manet, admired, the, immediacy, and, vivid, brushwork, of, vel, zquez, s, work, and, built, upon, vel, zquez, s, motifs, in, his, own, art, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, artists, such, as, james, mcneill, whistler, and, john, singer, sargent, were, strongly, influenced, by, vel, zquez, the, respect, with, which, twentieth, century, painters, regard, vel, zquez, s, work, attests, to, its, continuing, importance, pablo, picasso, paid, homage, to, vel, zquez, in, 1957, when, he, recreated, las, meninas, in, 44, variations, in, his, characteristic, style, although, picasso, was, concerned, that, his, reinterpretations, of, vel, zquez, s, painting, would, be, seen, merely, as, copies, rather, than, as, unique, representations, the, enormous, works, the, largest, he, had, produced, since, guernica, 1937, entered, the, canon, of, spanish, art, salvador, dal, as, with, picasso, in, anticipation, of, the, tercentennial, of, vel, zquez, s, death, created, in, 1958, a, work, entitled, vel, zquez, painting, the, infanta, margarita, with, the, lights, and, shadows, of, his, own, glory, the, color, scheme, shows, dal, s, serious, tribute, to, vel, zquez, the, work, also, functioned, as, in, picasso, s, case, as, a, vehicle, for, the, presentation, of, newer, theories, in, art, and, thought, nuclear, mysticism, in, dal, s, case, the, anglo, irish, painter, francis, bacon, found, vel, zquez, s, portrait, of, innocent, x, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, portraits, ever, he, created, several, expressionist, variations, of, this, piece, in, the, 1950s, however, bacon, s, paintings, sometimes, presented, a, more, gruesome, image, of, innocent, one, such, famous, variation, entitled, figure, with, meat, 1954, shows, the, pope, between, two, halves, of, a, bisected, cow, some, south, american, artists, also, pay, tribute, to, him, such, as, fernando, botero, with, his, portraits, of, oversized, characters, extracted, from, some, of, v, lasquez, paintings, and, herman, braun, vega, with, his, series, velasquez, exposed, accompanied, by, the, menines, from, which, the, main, polyptych, is, exhibited, at, the, antioquia, museum, in, medell, n, colombia, and, the, quadriptych, velasquez, going, to, his, easel, is, at, the, blanton, museum, of, art, in, austin, texas, in, 2009, the, portrait, of, a, man, in, the, collection, of, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, which, had, long, been, associated, with, the, followers, of, vel, zquez, style, of, painting, was, cleaned, and, restored, it, was, found, to, be, by, vel, zquez, himself, and, the, features, of, the, man, match, those, of, a, figure, in, the, painting, the, surrender, of, breda, the, newly, cleaned, canvas, may, therefore, be, a, study, for, that, painting, although, the, attribution, to, vel, zquez, is, regarded, as, certain, the, identity, of, the, sitter, is, still, open, to, question, some, art, historians, consider, this, new, study, to, be, a, self, portrait, by, vel, zquez, in, 2010, it, was, reported, that, a, damaged, painting, long, relegated, to, a, basement, of, the, yale, university, art, gallery, might, be, an, early, work, by, vel, zquez, thought, to, have, been, given, to, yale, in, 1925, the, painting, has, previously, been, attributed, to, the, 17th, century, spanish, school, some, scholars, are, prepared, to, attribute, the, painting, to, vel, zquez, although, the, prado, museum, in, madrid, is, reserving, judgment, the, work, which, depicts, the, virgin, mary, being, taught, to, read, will, be, restored, by, conservators, at, yale, in, october, 2011, it, was, confirmed, by, art, historian, dr, peter, cherry, of, trinity, college, dublin, through, x, ray, analysis, that, a, portrait, found, in, the, uk, in, the, former, collection, of, the, 19th, century, painter, matthew, shepperson, is, a, previously, unknown, work, by, vel, zquez, the, portrait, is, of, an, unidentified, man, in, his, fifties, or, sixties, who, could, possibly, be, juan, mateos, the, master, of, the, hunt, for, vel, zquez, s, patron, king, philip, iv, of,
