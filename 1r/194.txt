sergey, mikhaylovich, prokudin, gorsky, russian, ipa, august, 30, 1863, september, 27, 1944, was, a, russian, chemist, and, photographer, he, is, best, known, for, his, pioneering, work, in, colour, photography, and, his, effort, to, document, early, 20th, century, russia, using, a, railway, car, darkroom, provided, by, emperor, nicholas, ii, prokudin, gorsky, travelled, the, russian, empire, from, around, 1909, to, 1915, using, his, three, image, colour, photography, to, record, its, many, aspects, while, some, of, his, negatives, were, lost, the, majority, ended, up, in, the, us, library, of, congress, after, his, death, starting, in, 2000, the, negatives, were, digitised, and, the, colour, triples, for, each, subject, digitally, combined, to, produce, hundreds, of, high, quality, colour, images, of, russia, and, its, neighbours, from, over, a, century, ago, prokudin, gorsky, was, born, in, the, ancestral, estate, of, funikova, gora, in, the, pokrovsky, uyezd, of, the, vladimir, governorate, now, kirzhachsky, district, vladimir, oblast, his, parents, were, of, the, russian, nobility, and, the, family, had, a, long, military, history, they, moved, to, saint, petersburg, where, prokudin, gorsky, enrolled, in, saint, petersburg, state, institute, of, technology, to, study, chemistry, under, dmitri, mendeleev, he, also, studied, music, and, painting, at, the, imperial, academy, of, arts, in, 1890, prokudin, gorsky, married, anna, aleksandrovna, lavrova, and, later, the, couple, had, two, sons, mikhail, and, dmitri, and, a, daughter, ekaterina, anna, was, the, daughter, of, the, russian, industrialist, aleksandr, stepanovich, lavrov, an, active, member, in, the, imperial, russian, technical, society, irts, prokudin, gorsky, subsequently, became, the, director, of, the, executive, board, of, lavrov, s, metal, works, near, saint, petersburg, and, remained, so, until, the, october, revolution, he, also, joined, russia, s, oldest, photographic, society, the, photography, section, of, the, irts, presenting, papers, and, lecturing, on, the, science, of, photography, in, 1901, prokudin, gorsky, established, a, photographic, studio, and, laboratory, in, saint, petersburg, the, following, year, he, travelled, to, berlin, and, spent, 6, weeks, studying, colour, sensitization, and, three, colour, photography, with, photochemistry, professor, adolf, miethe, the, most, advanced, practitioner, in, germany, at, that, time, throughout, the, years, prokudin, gorsky, s, photographic, work, publications, and, slide, shows, to, other, scientists, and, photographers, in, russia, germany, and, france, earned, him, praise, and, in, 1906, he, was, elected, the, president, of, the, irts, photography, section, and, editor, of, russia, s, main, photography, journal, the, fotograf, liubitel, gorsky, was, a, member, of, the, royal, photographic, society, between, 1920, and, 1932, perhaps, prokudin, gorsky, s, best, known, work, during, his, lifetime, was, his, color, portrait, of, leo, tolstoy, which, was, reproduced, in, various, publications, on, postcards, and, as, larger, prints, for, framing, the, fame, from, this, photo, and, his, earlier, photos, of, russia, s, nature, and, monuments, earned, him, invitations, to, show, his, work, to, the, russian, grand, duke, michael, alexandrovich, and, dowager, empress, maria, feodorovna, in, 1908, and, to, tsar, nicholas, ii, and, his, family, in, 1909, the, tsar, enjoyed, the, demonstration, and, with, his, blessing, prokudin, gorsky, got, the, permission, and, funding, to, document, russia, in, color, in, the, course, of, ten, years, he, was, to, make, a, collection, of, 10, 000, photos, prokudin, gorsky, considered, the, project, his, life, s, work, and, continued, his, photographic, journeys, through, russia, until, after, the, october, revolution, under, the, new, regime, he, was, forced, to, accept, a, professorship, and, in, august, 1918, was, ordered, by, the, education, ministry, to, procure, projection, equipment, in, norway, he, still, pursued, scientific, work, in, color, photography, published, papers, in, english, photography, journals, and, together, with, his, colleague, s, o, maksimovich, obtained, patents, in, germany, england, france, and, italy, in, 1920, prokudin, gorsky, remarried, and, had, a, daughter, with, his, assistant, maria, fedorovna, n, e, schedrina, the, family, finally, settled, in, paris, in, 1922, reuniting, with, his, first, wife, and, children, prokudin, gorsky, set, up, a, photo, studio, there, together, with, his, three, adult, children, naming, it, after, his, fourth, child, elka, in, the, 1930s, the, elderly, prokudin, gorsky, continued, with, lectures, showing, his, photographs, of, russia, to, young, russians, in, france, but, stopped, commercial, work, and, left, the, studio, to, his, children, who, named, it, gorsky, fr, res, he, died, in, paris, on, september, 27, 1944, a, month, after, the, liberation, of, paris, he, is, buried, in, the, sainte, genevi, ve, des, bois, russian, cemetery, the, method, of, color, photography, used, by, prokudin, gorsky, was, first, suggested, by, james, clerk, maxwell, in, 1855, and, demonstrated, in, 1861, but, good, results, were, not, possible, with, the, photographic, materials, available, at, that, time, in, imitation, of, the, way, a, normal, human, eye, senses, color, the, visible, spectrum, of, colors, was, divided, into, three, channels, of, information, by, capturing, it, in, the, form, of, three, black, and, white, photographs, one, taken, through, a, red, filter, one, through, a, green, filter, and, one, through, a, blue, filter, the, resulting, three, photographs, could, be, projected, through, filters, of, the, same, colors, and, exactly, superimposed, on, a, screen, synthesizing, the, original, range, of, color, additively, or, viewed, as, an, additive, color, image, by, one, person, at, a, time, through, an, optical, device, known, generically, as, a, chromoscope, or, photochromoscope, which, contained, colored, filters, and, transparent, reflectors, that, visually, combined, the, three, into, one, full, color, image, or, used, to, make, photographic, or, mechanical, prints, in, the, complementary, colors, cyan, magenta, and, yellow, which, when, superimposed, reconstituted, the, color, subtractively, louis, ducos, du, hauron, conducted, early, experiments, with, the, three, color, principle, in, the, late, 1860s, during, the, period, from, the, 1870s, to, the, 1890s, he, created, several, color, prints, and, photographs, in, 1877, edward, bierstadt, showcased, the, first, successful, three, color, prints, in, the, united, states, his, work, gained, attention, in, the, 1890s, when, he, exhibited, color, prints, of, various, subjects, such, as, oil, and, watercolor, paintings, floral, studies, and, portraits, from, life, the, first, person, to, widely, demonstrate, good, results, by, this, method, was, frederic, e, ives, whose, kromskop, system, of, viewers, projectors, and, camera, equipment, was, commercially, available, from, 1897, until, about, 1907, only, the, viewers, and, ready, made, triple, photographs, for, use, in, them, sold, in, any, significant, quantity, still, life, arrangements, unpopulated, landscapes, and, oil, paintings, were, the, typical, subject, matter, but, a, few, examples, of, color, portraiture, from, life, were, also, offered, another, very, notable, practitioner, was, adolf, miethe, with, whom, prokudin, gorsky, studied, in, germany, in, 1902, miethe, was, a, photochemist, who, greatly, improved, the, panchromatic, characteristics, of, the, black, and, white, photographic, materials, suitable, for, use, with, this, method, of, color, photography, he, presented, projected, color, photographs, to, the, german, imperial, family, in, 1902, and, was, exhibiting, them, to, the, general, public, in, 1903, when, they, also, began, to, appear, in, periodicals, and, books, miethe, took, the, first, known, aerial, color, photographs, from, a, hot, air, balloon, in, 1906, in, england, in, 1899, ives, s, former, assistant, edward, sanger, shepherd, commercialized, the, application, of, the, three, colour, process, in, the, sanger, shepherd, process, of, natural, colour, photography, with, his, process, in, 1903, and, 1904, sarah, angelina, acland, produced, the, first, substantial, body, of, work, in, colour, photography, by, an, amateur, photographer, by, 1905, seventeen, different, photographers, had, shown, three, colour, slides, by, the, sanger, shepherd, process, at, exhibitions, of, the, royal, photographic, society, in, england, in, 1905, the, neue, photographische, gesellschaft, established, a, color, photography, studio, in, berlin, the, studio, utilized, the, three, color, principle, and, employed, a, printing, process, developed, by, robert, krayn, some, of, the, resulting, images, were, published, as, postcards, featuring, notable, individuals, including, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, and, pope, pius, x, photographic, plates, which, had, the, light, sensitive, emulsion, coated, on, a, thin, sheet, of, glass, were, normally, used, instead, of, flexible, film, both, because, a, general, transition, from, glass, plates, to, plastic, film, was, still, in, progress, and, because, glass, provided, the, best, dimensional, stability, for, three, images, intended, to, match, up, perfectly, when, they, were, later, combined, an, ordinary, camera, could, be, used, to, take, the, three, pictures, by, reloading, it, and, changing, filters, between, exposures, but, pioneering, color, photographers, usually, built, or, bought, special, cameras, that, made, the, procedure, less, awkward, and, time, consuming, one, of, the, two, main, types, used, beam, splitters, to, produce, three, separate, images, in, the, camera, making, all, three, exposures, at, the, same, time, and, from, the, same, viewpoint, although, a, camera, of, this, type, was, ideal, in, theory, such, cameras, were, optically, complicated, and, delicate, and, liable, to, get, out, of, adjustment, some, designs, were, also, subject, to, optical, phenomena, that, could, cause, noticeably, uneven, color, or, other, defects, in, the, results, the, other, more, robust, type, was, an, essentially, ordinary, camera, with, a, special, sliding, holder, for, the, plates, and, filters, that, allowed, each, in, turn, to, be, efficiently, shifted, into, position, for, exposure, an, operation, sometimes, partly, or, even, entirely, automated, with, a, pneumatic, mechanism, or, spring, powered, motor, when, the, three, color, filtered, photographs, were, not, taken, at, the, same, time, anything, in, the, scene, that, did, not, hold, steady, during, the, entire, operation, would, exhibit, colored, fringes, around, its, edges, in, the, resulting, color, image, if, it, moved, continuously, across, the, scene, three, separate, strongly, colored, ghost, images, could, result, such, color, artifacts, are, plainly, visible, in, ordinary, color, composites, of, many, of, prokudin, gorsky, s, photographs, but, special, digital, image, processing, software, was, used, to, artificially, remove, them, whenever, possible, from, the, composites, of, all, 1, 902, of, the, images, commissioned, by, the, library, of, congress, in, 2004, the, altered, versions, have, proliferated, online, and, older, or, third, party, versions, showing, these, tell, tale, peculiarities, are, increasingly, scarce, adolf, miethe, designed, a, high, quality, sequential, exposure, color, camera, which, was, manufactured, by, bermpohl, and, became, available, commercially, in, 1903, prokudin, gorsky, published, an, illustration, of, it, in, fotograf, liubitel, in, 1906, the, most, common, model, used, a, single, oblong, plate, 9, cm, wide, by, 24, cm, high, the, same, format, as, prokudin, gorsky, s, surviving, negatives, and, it, photographed, the, images, in, unconventional, blue, green, red, sequence, which, is, also, a, characteristic, of, prokudin, gorsky, s, negatives, if, the, usual, upside, down, image, in, a, camera, and, gravity, compliant, downward, shiftings, of, his, plates, are, assumed, an, inventor, as, well, as, a, photographer, prokudin, gorsky, patented, an, optical, system, for, cameras, of, the, simultaneous, exposure, type, and, it, is, often, claimed, or, implied, that, he, invented, or, at, least, built, the, camera, used, for, his, russian, empire, project, no, definite, written, or, photographic, documentation, of, his, field, equipment, is, known, to, exist, only, the, evidence, inherent, in, the, photographs, themselves, and, no, rationale, has, been, suggested, for, going, to, the, trouble, and, expense, of, building, a, functionally, identical, copy, of, a, miethe, bermpohl, camera, instead, of, simply, buying, one, miethe, and, bermpohl, also, produced, a, matching, three, color, projector, and, a, chromoscope, the, goerz, optical, company, made, a, differently, configured, and, more, powerful, three, color, projector, for, miethe, it, too, was, commercially, available, the, required, exposure, time, depended, on, the, lighting, conditions, the, sensitivity, of, the, photographic, plate, and, the, camera, lens, aperture, used, in, a, letter, to, leo, tolstoy, requesting, a, portrait, sitting, prokudin, gorsky, described, the, exposure, as, taking, one, to, three, seconds, but, later, when, recollecting, his, time, with, tolstoy, he, described, a, six, second, exposure, on, a, sunny, day, blaise, ag, era, y, arcas, studied, one, landscape, view, photographed, in, broad, daylight, but, showing, a, clear, well, defined, moon, and, used, the, moon, s, movement, to, estimate, that, the, whole, procedure, of, three, filtered, exposures, and, two, repositionings, of, the, camera, s, plate, holder, had, taken, over, a, minute, the, lens, aperture, prokudin, gorsky, chose, to, use, greatly, affected, the, exposure, time, required, a, small, aperture, is, often, used, for, landscape, photography, because, it, allows, objects, at, various, distances, to, all, be, sharply, imaged, at, the, same, time, while, the, use, of, a, large, aperture, is, common, for, portraiture, and, plainly, evident, in, the, tolstoy, portrait, all, other, factors, being, equal, if, for, example, a, 16, second, exposure, was, required, when, using, a, 1, 4, inch, diameter, aperture, an, exposure, of, only, 1, second, would, suffice, with, a, 1, inch, aperture, prokudin, gorsky, was, also, acquainted, with, the, use, of, autochrome, color, plates, which, did, not, require, a, special, camera, or, projector, he, was, one, of, the, favored, few, the, lumi, re, brothers, introduced, to, their, new, product, in, 1906, the, year, before, it, went, into, commercial, production, autochrome, plates, were, expensive, and, not, sensitive, enough, for, casual, snapshots, with, a, hand, held, camera, but, their, use, was, simple, and, in, expert, hands, they, were, capable, of, producing, excellent, results, they, made, color, photography, truly, practical, for, advanced, amateurs, and, led, some, pioneering, users, of, color, separation, cameras, to, abandon, their, methods, as, outmoded, but, prokudin, gorsky, was, not, won, over, no, autochromes, by, prokudin, gorsky, are, known, to, survive, although, photographic, color, prints, of, the, images, were, difficult, to, make, at, the, time, and, slide, show, lectures, consumed, much, of, the, time, prokudin, gorsky, used, to, demonstrate, his, work, photomechanical, color, prints, of, some, were, published, in, journals, and, books, and, his, studio, issued, some, most, notably, the, tolstoy, portrait, as, postcards, and, large, photogravures, many, of, the, original, prints, published, by, his, studio, still, survive, prokudin, gorsky, s, own, inventions, some, of, them, collaborative, led, to, the, granting, of, numerous, patents, most, issued, during, the, years, of, his, voluntary, exile, and, not, directly, related, to, the, body, of, work, on, which, his, fame, now, rests, some, concern, processes, for, making, subtractive, color, transparencies, which, do, not, require, any, special, projection, or, viewing, equipment, examples, of, these, were, preserved, by, prokudin, gorsky, s, family, and, have, recently, appeared, online, most, of, his, patents, relate, to, the, production, of, natural, color, motion, pictures, a, potentially, lucrative, application, that, attracted, the, attention, of, many, inventors, in, the, field, of, color, photography, during, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, around, 1905, prokudin, gorsky, envisioned, and, formulated, a, plan, to, use, the, emerging, technological, advances, that, had, been, made, in, color, photography, to, document, the, russian, empire, systematically, through, such, an, ambitious, project, his, ultimate, goal, was, to, educate, the, schoolchildren, of, russia, with, his, optical, color, projections, of, the, vast, and, diverse, history, culture, and, modernization, of, the, empire, outfitted, with, a, specially, equipped, railroad, car, darkroom, provided, by, tsar, nicholas, ii, and, in, possession, of, two, permits, that, granted, him, access, to, restricted, areas, and, cooperation, from, the, empire, s, bureaucracy, prokudin, gorsky, documented, the, russian, empire, between, around, 1909, and, 1915, he, conducted, many, illustrated, lectures, of, his, work, his, photographs, offer, a, vivid, portrait, of, a, lost, world, the, russian, empire, on, the, eve, of, world, war, i, and, the, coming, russian, civil, war, his, subjects, ranged, from, the, medieval, churches, and, monasteries, of, old, russia, to, the, railroads, and, factories, of, an, emerging, industrial, power, to, the, daily, life, and, work, of, russia, s, diverse, population, it, has, been, estimated, from, prokudin, gorsky, s, personal, inventory, that, before, leaving, russia, he, had, about, 3, 500, negatives, upon, leaving, the, country, and, exporting, all, his, photographic, material, about, half, of, the, photos, were, confiscated, by, russian, authorities, for, containing, material, they, deemed, strategically, sensitive, for, war, time, russia, according, to, prokudin, gorsky, s, notes, the, photos, left, behind, were, not, of, interest, to, the, general, public, some, of, prokudin, gorsky, s, negatives, were, given, away, and, some, he, hid, on, his, departure, outside, the, library, of, congress, collection, none, has, yet, been, found, by, the, time, of, prokudin, gorsky, s, death, the, tsar, and, his, family, had, long, since, been, executed, during, the, russian, civil, war, and, most, of, the, former, empire, was, now, the, soviet, union, the, surviving, boxes, of, photo, albums, and, fragile, glass, plates, the, negatives, were, recorded, on, were, finally, stored, in, the, basement, of, a, parisian, apartment, building, and, the, family, was, worried, about, them, getting, damaged, the, united, states, library, of, congress, purchased, the, material, from, prokudin, gorsky, s, heirs, in, 1948, for, 3, 500, 5, 000, on, the, initiative, of, a, researcher, inquiring, into, their, whereabouts, the, library, counted, 1, 902, negatives, and, 710, album, prints, without, corresponding, negatives, in, the, collection, due, to, the, very, specialized, and, labor, intensive, processes, required, to, make, photographic, color, prints, from, the, negatives, only, about, a, hundred, of, the, images, were, used, in, exhibits, books, and, scholarly, articles, during, the, half, century, after, the, library, of, congress, acquired, them, their, widest, exposure, was, in, the, 1980, coffee, table, book, photographs, for, the, tsar, the, pioneering, color, photography, of, sergei, mikhailovich, prokudin, gorskii, commissioned, by, tsar, nicholas, ii, in, which, the, color, images, are, combined, yellow, magenta, and, cyan, ink, on, paper, halftones, mass, produced, with, a, multicolor, printing, press, in, the, usual, way, it, was, only, with, the, advent, of, digital, image, processing, that, multiple, images, could, be, quickly, and, easily, combined, into, one, the, library, of, congress, undertook, a, project, in, 2000, to, make, digital, scans, of, all, the, photographic, material, received, from, prokudin, gorsky, s, heirs, and, contracted, with, the, photographer, walter, frankhauser, to, combine, the, monochrome, negatives, into, color, images, he, created, 122, color, renderings, using, a, method, he, called, digichromatography, and, commented, that, each, image, took, him, around, six, to, seven, hours, to, align, clean, and, color, correct, in, 2001, the, library, of, congress, produced, an, exhibition, from, these, the, empire, that, was, russia, the, prokudin, gorskii, photographic, record, recreated, the, photographs, have, since, been, the, subject, of, many, other, exhibitions, in, the, area, where, prokudin, gorsky, took, his, photos, in, 2004, the, library, of, congress, contracted, with, computer, scientist, blaise, ag, era, y, arcas, to, produce, an, automated, color, composite, of, each, of, the, 1, 902, negatives, from, the, high, resolution, digital, images, of, the, glass, plate, negatives, he, applied, algorithms, to, compensate, for, the, differences, between, the, exposures, and, prepared, color, composites, of, all, the, negatives, in, the, collection, as, the, library, offers, the, high, resolution, images, of, the, negatives, freely, on, the, internet, many, others, have, since, created, their, own, color, representations, of, the, photos, and, they, have, become, a, favorite, testbed, for, computer, scientists, some, of, sergey, prokudin, gorsky, s, photographs, digitally, processed, made, available, by, the, library, of, congress
