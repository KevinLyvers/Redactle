films, he, made, between, 1917, and, 1928, still, survive, in, their, entirety, however, prints, of, several, ford, silents, previously, thought, lost, have, been, rediscovered, in, foreign, film, archives, over, recent, years, in, 2009, a, trove, of, 75, hollywood, silent, films, was, rediscovered, in, the, new, zealand, film, archive, among, which, was, the, only, surviving, print, of, ford, s, 1927, silent, comedy, upstream, the, print, was, restored, in, new, zealand, by, the, academy, of, motion, picture, arts, sciences, before, being, returned, to, america, where, it, was, given, a, re, premiere, at, the, samuel, goldwyn, theater, in, beverly, hills, on, august, 31, 2010, featuring, a, newly, commissioned, score, by, michael, mortilla, throughout, his, career, ford, was, one, of, the, busiest, directors, in, hollywood, but, he, was, extraordinarily, productive, in, his, first, few, years, as, a, director, he, made, ten, films, in, 1917, eight, in, 1918, and, fifteen, in, 1919, and, he, directed, a, total, of, 62, shorts, and, features, between, 1917, and, 1928, although, he, was, not, given, a, screen, credit, in, most, of, his, earliest, films, there, is, some, uncertainty, about, the, identity, of, ford, s, first, film, as, director, film, writer, ephraim, katz, notes, that, ford, might, have, directed, the, four, part, film, lucille, the, waitress, as, early, as, 1914, but, most, sources, cite, his, directorial, d, but, as, the, silent, two, reeler, the, tornado, released, in, march, 1917, according, to, ford, s, own, story, he, was, given, the, job, by, universal, boss, carl, laemmle, who, supposedly, said, give, jack, ford, the, job, he, yells, good, the, tornado, was, quickly, followed, by, a, string, of, two, reeler, and, three, reeler, quickies, the, trail, of, hate, the, scrapper, the, soul, herder, and, cheyenne, s, pal, these, were, made, over, the, space, of, a, few, months, and, each, typically, shot, in, just, two, or, three, days, all, are, now, presumed, lost, the, soul, herder, is, also, notable, as, the, beginning, of, ford, s, four, year, 25, film, association, with, veteran, writer, actor, harry, carey, who, with, ford, s, brother, francis, was, a, strong, early, influence, on, the, young, director, as, well, as, being, one, of, the, major, influences, on, the, screen, persona, of, ford, s, protege, john, wayne, carey, s, son, harry, dobe, carey, jr, who, also, became, an, actor, was, one, of, ford, s, closest, friends, in, later, years, and, featured, in, many, of, his, most, celebrated, westerns, ford, s, first, feature, length, production, was, straight, shooting, august, 1917, which, is, also, his, earliest, complete, surviving, film, as, director, and, one, of, only, two, survivors, from, his, twenty, five, film, collaboration, with, harry, carey, in, making, the, film, ford, and, carey, ignored, studio, orders, and, turned, in, five, reels, instead, of, two, and, it, was, only, through, the, intervention, of, carl, laemmle, that, the, film, escaped, being, cut, for, its, first, release, although, it, was, subsequently, edited, down, to, two, reels, for, re, release, in, the, late, 1920s, ford, s, last, film, of, 1917, bucking, broadway, was, long, thought, to, have, been, lost, but, in, 2002, the, only, known, surviving, print, was, discovered, in, the, archives, of, the, french, national, center, for, cinematography, and, it, has, since, been, restored, and, digitized, ford, directed, around, 36, films, over, three, years, for, universal, before, moving, to, the, william, fox, studio, in, 1920, his, first, film, for, them, was, just, pals, 1920, his, 1923, feature, cameo, kirby, starring, screen, idol, john, gilbert, another, of, the, few, surviving, ford, silents, marked, his, first, directing, credit, under, the, name, john, ford, rather, than, jack, ford, as, he, had, previously, been, credited, ford, s, first, major, success, as, a, director, was, the, historical, drama, the, iron, horse, 1924, an, epic, account, of, the, building, of, the, first, transcontinental, railroad, it, was, a, large, long, and, difficult, production, filmed, on,

replicas, of, the, jupiter, and, 119, locomotives, that, met, at, promontory, summit, when, the, two, ends, of, the, line, were, joined, on, may, 10, 1869, although, ford, was, to, become, one, of, the, most, honored, of, hollywood, directors, by, film, makers, as, well, as, critics, his, reputation, in, 1928, was, modest, at, best, while, he, proved, himself, a, commercially, responsible, director, only, two, or, three, of, his, films, had, earned, more, than, passing, notice, the, pre, 1929, ford, according, to, andrew, sarris, seemed, to, deserve, at, most, a, footnote, in, film, history, film, historian, richard, koszarski, 1976, ford, s, brother, eddie, was, a, crew, member, and, they, fought, constantly, on, one, occasion, eddie, reportedly, went, after, the, old, man, with, a, pick, handle, there, was, only, a, short, synopsis, written, when, filming, began, and, ford, wrote, and, shot, the, film, day, by, day, production, fell, behind, schedule, delayed, by, constant, bad, weather, and, the, intense, cold, and, fox, executives, repeatedly, demanded, results, but, ford, would, either, tear, up, the, telegrams, or, hold, them, up, and, have, stunt, gunman, edward, pardner, jones, shoot, holes, through, the, sender, s, name, despite, the, pressure, to, halt, the, production, studio, boss, william, fox, finally, backed, ford, and, allowed, him, to, finish, the, picture, and, his, gamble, paid, off, handsomely, the, iron, horse, became, one, of, the, top, grossing, films, of, the, decade, taking, over, us, 2, million, worldwide, against, a, budget, of, 280, 000, ford, made, a, wide, range, of, films, in, this, period, and, he, became, well, known, for, his, western, and, frontier, pictures, but, the, genre, rapidly, lost, its, appeal, for, major, studios, in, the, late, 1920s, ford, s, last, silent, western, was, 3, bad, men, 1926, set, during, the, dakota, land, rush, and, filmed, at, jackson, hole, wyoming, and, in, the, mojave,

uncredited, extra, and, he, appeared, as, an, extra, in, several, of, ford, s, films, over, the, next, two, years, moreover, hangman, s, house, 1928, is, notable, as, it, features, john, wayne, s, first, confirmed, onscreen, appearance, in, a, ford, film, playing, an, excitable, spectator, during, the, horse, race, sequence, just, before, the, studio, converted, to, talkies, fox, gave, a, contract, to, the, german, director, f, w, murnau, and, his, film, sunrise, a, song, of, two, humans, 1927, still, highly, regarded, by, critics, had, a, powerful, effect, on, ford, murnau, s,

his, best, film, but, it, fared, relatively, poorly, compared, to, its, predecessor, grossing, only, 750, 000, in, its, first, year, it, also, caused, a, rift, between, ford, and, scriptwriter,

another, western, 3, godfathers, a, remake, of, a, 1916, silent, film, starring, harry, carey, to, whom, ford, s, version, was, dedicated, which, ford, had, himself, already, remade, in, 1919, as,

project, but, worked, only, one, day, before, being, taken, ill, supposedly, with, shingles, and, elia, kazan, replaced, him, although, tag, gallagher, suggests, that, ford, s, illness, was, a,

master, starring, ben, johnson, and, harry, carey, jr, which, is, particularly, noteworthy, as, the, only, ford, film, since, 1930, that, he, scripted, himself, it, was, subsequently, adapted, into, the, long, running, tv, series, wagon, train, with, ward, bond, reprising, the, title, role, until, his, sudden, death, in, 1960, although, it, did, far, smaller, business, than, most, of, his, other,

which, ford, had, wanted, to, make, since, the, 1930s, and, almost, did, so, in, 1937, with, an, independent, cooperative, called, renowned, artists, company, it, became, his, biggest, grossing,

one, point, he, briefly, lost, his, sight, entirely, his, prodigious, memory, also, began, to, falter, making, it, necessary, to, rely, more, and, more, on, assistants, his, work, was, also, restricted, by, the, new, regime, in, hollywood, and, he, found, it, hard, to, get, many, projects, made, by, the, 1960s, he, had, been, pigeonholed, as, a, western, director, and, complained, that,

over, 3, million, in, its, first, year, although, the, lead, casting, stretched, credibility, the, characters, played, by, stewart, then, 53, and, wayne, then, 54, could, be, assumed, to, be, in, their, early, 20s, given, the, circumstances, and, ford, reportedly, considered, casting, a, younger, actor, in, stewart, s, role, but, feared, it, would, highlight, wayne, s, age, though, it, is, often, claimed, that, budget, constraints, necessitated, shooting, most, of, the, film, on, soundstages, on, the, paramount, lot, studio, accounting, records, show, that, this, was, part, of, the,

to, protect, his, poor, eyesight, he, was, an, inveterate, pipe, smoker, and, while, he, was, shooting, he, would, chew, on, a, linen, handkerchief, each, morning, his, wife, would, give, him, a,

his, study, was, always, littered, with, books, papers, and, clothes, he, bought, a, brand, new, rolls, royce, in, the, 1930s, but, never, rode, in, it, because, his, wife, mary, would, not, let, him, smoke, in, it, his, own, car, a, battered, ford, roadster, was, so, dilapidated, and, messy, that, he, was, once, late, for, a, studio, meeting, because, the, guard, at, the, studio, gate, did, not, believe, that, the, real, john, ford, would, drive, such, a, car, and, refused, to, let, him, in, ford, held, antipathy, towards, studio, executives, on, one, early, film, for, fox, he, is, said, to, have, ordered, a, guard, to, keep, studio, boss, darryl, f, zanuck, off, the, set, and, on, another, occasion, he, brought, an, executive, in, front, of, the, crew, stood, him, in, profile, and,

as, soon, as, you, get, the, hell, off, my, set, at, dinner, ford, reportedly, recruited, cast, member, alberto, morin, to, masquerade, as, an, inept, french, waiter, who, proceeded, to, spill, soup, over, them, break, plates, and, cause, general, mayhem, but, the, two, executives, apparently, didn, t, realise, they, were, the, victims, of, one, of, ford, s, practical, jokes, he, greatly, enjoyed, spending, time, on, his, yacht, araner, which, he, bought, in, 1934, and, on, which, he, lavished, hundreds, of, thousands, of, dollars, in, repairs, and, improvements, over, the, years, it, became, his, chief, retreat, between, films, and, a, meeting, place, for, his, circle, of, close, friends, including, john, wayne, and, ward, bond, ford, was, highly, intelligent, erudite, sensitive, and, sentimental, but, to, protect, himself, in, the, cutthroat, atmosphere, of, hollywood, he, cultivated, the, image, of, a, tough, two, fisted, hard, drinking, irish, sonofabitch, one, famous, event, witnessed, by, ford, s, friend, actor, frank, baker, strikingly, illustrates, the, tension, between, the, public, persona, and, the, private, man, during, the, depression, ford, by, then, a, very, wealthy, man, was, accosted, outside, his, office, by, a, former, universal, actor, who, was, destitute, and, needed, 200, for, an, operation, for, his, wife, as, the, man, related, his, misfortunes, ford, appeared, to, become, enraged, and, then, to, the, horror, of, onlookers, he, launched, himself, at, the, man, knocked, him, to, the, floor, and, shouted, how, dare, you, come, here, like, this, who, do, think, you, are, to, talk, to, me, this, way, before, storming, out, of, the, room, however, as, the, shaken, old, man, left, the, building, frank, baker, saw, ford, s, business, manager, fred, totman, meet, him, at, the, door, where, he, handed, the, man, a, cheque, for, 1, 000, and, instructed, ford, s, chauffeur, to, drive, him, home, there, an, ambulance, was, waiting, to, take, the, man, s, wife, to, the, hospital, where, a, specialist, flown, in, from, san, francisco, at, ford, s, expense, performed, the, operation, sometime, later, ford, purchased, a, house, for, the, couple, and, pensioned, them, for, life, when, baker, related, the, story, to, francis, ford, he, declared, that, the, incident, illustrated, his, brother, s, personality, very, well, any, moment, if, that, old, actor, had, kept, talking, people, would, have, realized, what, a, softy, jack, is, he, couldn, t, have, stood, through, that, sad, story, without, breaking, down, he, s, built, this, whole, legend, of, toughness, around, himself, to, protect, his, softness, in, the, book, wayne, and, ford, the, films, the, friendship, and, the, forging, of, an, american, hero, by, nancy, schoenberger, the, author, dissects, the, cultural, impact, of, the, masculinity, portrayed, in, ford, s, films, in, an, interview, with, portland, magazine, schoenberger, states, regarding, ford, and, wayne, tweaking, the, conventions, of, what, a, man, is, today, i, think, ford, having, grown, up, with, brothers, he, idolized, in, a, rough, and, tumble, world, of, boxers, drinkers, and, roustabouts, found, his, deepest, theme, in, male, camaraderie, especially, in, the, military, one, of, the, few, places, where, men, can, express, their, love, for, other, men, but, he, was, concerned, with, men, acting, heroically, thus, the, most, macho, guy, was, not, always, the, most, heroic, mclaglen, often, presented, the, comic, side, of, blustery, masculinity, ford, brought, out, wayne, s, tenderness, as, well, as, his, toughness, especially, in, stagecoach, ford, had, many, distinctive, stylistic, trademarks, and, a, suite, of, thematic, preoccupations, and, visual, and, aural, motifs, recurs, throughout, his, work, as, a, director, film, journalist, ephraim, katz, summarized, some, of, the, keynote, features, of, ford, s, work, in, his, collins, film, encyclopedia, entry, of, all, american, directors, ford, probably, had, the, clearest, personal, vision, and, the, most, consistent, visual, style, his, ideas, and, his, characters, are, like, many, things, branded, american, deceptively, simple, his, heroes, may, appear, simply, to, be, loners, outsiders, to, established, society, who, generally, speak, through, action, rather, than, words, but, their, conflict, with, society, embodies, larger, themes, in, the, american, experience, ford, s, films, particularly, the, westerns, express, a, deep, aesthetic, sensibility, for, the, american, past, and, the, spirit, of, the, frontier, his, compositions, have, a, classic, strength, in, which, masses, of, people, and, their, natural, surroundings, are, beautifully, juxtaposed, often, in, breathtaking, long, shots, the, movement, of, men, and, horses, in, his, westerns, has, rarely, been, surpassed, for, regal, serenity, and, evocative, power, the, musical, score, often, variations, on, folk, themes, plays, a, more, important, part, than, dialogue, in, many, ford, films, ford, also, championed, the, value, and, force, of, the, group, as, evidenced, in, his, many, military, dramas, expressed, a, similar, sentiment, for, camaraderie, through, his, repeated, use, of, certain, actors, in, the, lead, and, supporting, roles, he, also, felt, an, allegiance, to, places, in, contrast, to, his, contemporary, alfred, hitchcock, ford, never, used, storyboards, composing, his, pictures, entirely, in, his, head, without, any, written, or, graphic, outline, of, the, shots, he, would, use, script, development, could, be, intense, but, once, approved, his, screenplays, were, rarely, rewritten, he, was, also, one, of, the, first, filmmakers, to, encourage, his, writers, and, actors, to, prepare, a, full, back, story, for, their, characters, he, hated, long, expository, scenes, and, was, famous, for, tearing, pages, out, of, a, script, to, cut, dialogue, during, the, making, of, mogambo, when, challenged, by, the, film, s, producer, sam, zimbalist, about, falling, three, days, behind, schedule, ford, responded, by, tearing, three, pages, out, of, the, script, and, declaring, we, re, on, schedule, and, indeed, he, never, filmed, those, pages, while, making, drums, along, the, mohawk, ford, neatly, sidestepped, the, challenge, of, shooting, a, large, and, expensive, battle, scene, he, had, henry, fonda, improvise, a, monologue, while, firing, questions, from, behind, the, camera, about, the, course, of, the, battle, a, subject, on, which, fonda, was, well, versed, and, then, simply, editing, out, the, questions, he, was, relatively, sparing, in, his, use, of, camera, movements, and, close, ups, preferring, static, medium, or, long, shots, with, his, players, framed, against, dramatic, vistas, or, interiors, lit, in, an, expressionistic, style, although, he, often, used, panning, shots, and, sometimes, used, a, dramatic, dolly, in, e, g, john, wayne, s, first, appearance, in, stagecoach, ford, is, famous, for, his, exciting, tracking, shots, such, as, the, apache, chase, sequence, in, stagecoach, or, the, attack, on, the, comanche, camp, in, the, searchers, recurring, visual, motifs, include, trains, and, wagons, many, ford, films, begin, and, end, with, a, linking, vehicle, such, as, a, train, or, wagon, arriving, and, leaving, doorways, roads, flowers, rivers, gatherings, parades, dances, meetings, bar, scenes, etc, he, also, employed, gestural, motifs, in, many, films, notably, the, throwing, of, objects, and, the, lighting, of, lamps, matches, or, cigarettes, if, a, doomed, character, was, shown, playing, poker, such, as, liberty, valance, or, gunman, tom, tyler, in, stagecoach, the, last, hand, he, plays, is, the, death, hand, two, eights, and, two, aces, one, of, them, the, ace, of, spades, so, called, because, wild, bill, hickok, is, said, to, have, held, this, hand, when, he, was, murdered, many, of, his, sound, films, include, renditions, or, quotations, of, his, favorite, hymn, shall, we, gather, at, the, river, such, as, its, parodic, use, to, underscore, the, opening, scenes, of, stagecoach, when, the, prostitute, dallas, is, being, run, out, of, town, by, local, matrons, character, names, also, recur, in, many, ford, films, the, name, quincannon, for, example, is, used, in, several, films, including, the, lost, patrol, rio, grande, she, wore, a, yellow, ribbon, and, fort, apache, john, wayne, s, character, is, named, kirby, yorke, in, both, fort, apache, and, rio, grande, and, the, names, tyree, and, boone, are, also, recur, in, several, ford, films, recent, works, about, ford, s, depictions, of, native, americans, have, argued, that, contrary, to, popular, belief, his, indian, characters, spanned, a, range, of, hostile, to, sympathetic, images, from, the, iron, horse, to, cheyenne, autumn, his, depiction, of, the, navajo, in, wagon, master, included, their, characters, speaking, the, navajo, language, the, distinguishing, mark, of, ford, s, indian, themed, westerns, is, that, his, native, characters, always, remained, separate, and, apart, from, white, society, ford, was, legendary, for, his, discipline, and, efficiency, on, set, and, was, notorious, for, being, extremely, tough, on, his, actors, frequently, mocking, yelling, and, bullying, them, he, was, also, infamous, for, his, sometimes, sadistic, practical, jokes, any, actor, foolish, enough, to, demand, star, treatment, would, receive, the, full, force, of, his, relentless, scorn, and, sarcasm, he, once, referred, to, john, wayne, as, a, big, idiot, and, even, punched, henry, fonda, henry, brandon, who, played, chief, scar, from, the, searchers, once, referred, to, ford, as, the, only, man, who, could, make, john, wayne, cry, he, likewise, belittled, victor, mclaglen, on, one, occasion, reportedly, bellowing, through, the, megaphone, d, ya, know, mclaglen, that, fox, are, paying, you, 1200, a, week, to, do, things, that, i, could, get, any, child, off, the, street, to, do, better, stock, company, veteran, ward, bond, was, reportedly, one, of, the, few, actors, who, were, impervious, to, ford, s, taunting, and, sarcasms, sir, donald, sinden, then, a, contract, star, for, the, rank, organisation, at, pinewood, studios, when, he, starred, in, mogambo, was, not, the, only, person, to, suffer, at, the, hands, of, john, ford, s, notorious, behaviour, he, recalls, ten, white, hunters, were, seconded, to, our, unit, for, our, protection, and, to, provide, fresh, meat, among, them, was, marcus, lord, wallscourt, a, delightful, man, whom, ford, treated, abysmally, sometimes, very, sadistically, in, ford, s, eyes, the, poor, man, could, do, nothing, right, and, was, continually, being, bawled, out, in, front, of, the, entire, unit, in, some, ways, he, occasionally, took, the, heat, off, me, none, of, us, could, understand, the, reason, for, this, appalling, treatment, which, the, dear, kind, man, in, no, way, deserved, he, himself, was, quite, at, a, loss, several, weeks, later, we, discovered, the, cause, from, ford, s, brother, in, law, before, emigrating, to, america, ford, s, grandfather, had, been, a, labourer, on, the, estate, in, ireland, of, the, then, lord, wallscourt, ford, was, now, getting, his, own, back, at, his, descendant, not, a, charming, sight, we, now, had, to, return, to, the, mgm, british, studios, in, london, to, shoot, all, the, interior, scenes, someone, must, have, pointed, out, to, ford, that, he, had, been, thoroughly, foul, to, me, during, the, entire, location, shoot, and, when, i, arrived, for, my, first, day, s, work, i, found, that, he, had, caused, a, large, notice, to, be, painted, at, the, entrance, to, our, sound, stage, in, capital, letters, reading, be, kind, to, donald, week, he, was, as, good, as, his, word, for, precisely, seven, days, on, the, eighth, day, he, ripped, the, sign, down, and, returned, to, his, normal, bullying, behaviour, ford, usually, gave, his, actors, little, explicit, direction, although, on, occasion, he, would, casually, walk, through, a, scene, himself, and, actors, were, expected, to, note, every, subtle, action, or, mannerism, if, they, did, not, ford, would, make, them, repeat, the, scene, until, they, got, it, right, and, he, would, often, berate, and, belittle, those, who, failed, to, achieve, his, desired, performance, on, the, man, who, shot, liberty, valance, ford, ran, through, a, scene, with, edmond, o, brien, and, ended, by, drooping, his, hand, over, a, railing, o, brien, noticed, this, but, deliberately, ignored, it, placing, his, hand, on, the, railing, instead, ford, would, not, explicitly, correct, him, and, he, reportedly, made, o, brien, play, the, scene, forty, two, times, before, the, actor, relented, and, did, it, ford, s, way, despite, his, often, difficult, and, demanding, personality, many, actors, who, worked, with, ford, acknowledged, that, he, brought, out, the, best, in, them, john, wayne, remarked, that, nobody, could, handle, actors, and, crew, like, jack, dobe, carey, stated, that, he, had, a, quality, that, made, everyone, almost, kill, themselves, to, please, him, upon, arriving, on, the, set, you, would, feel, right, away, that, something, special, was, going, to, happen, you, would, feel, spiritually, awakened, all, of, a, sudden, carey, credits, ford, with, the, inspiration, of, carey, s, final, film, comanche, stallion, 2005, ford, s, favorite, location, for, his, western, films, was, southern, utah, s, monument, valley, although, not, generally, appropriate, geographically, as, a, setting, for, his, plots, the, expressive, visual, impact, of, the, area, enabled, ford, to, define, images, of, the, american, west, with, some, of, the, most, beautiful, and, powerful, cinematography, ever, shot, in, such, films, as, stagecoach, the, searchers, and, fort, apache, a, notable, example, is, the, famous, scene, in, she, wore, a, yellow, ribbon, in, which, the, cavalry, troop, is, photographed, against, an, oncoming, storm, the, influence, on, the, films, of, classic, western, artists, such, as, frederic, remington, and, others, has, been, examined, ford, s, evocative, use, of, the, territory, for, his, westerns, has, defined, the, images, of, the, american, west, so, powerfully, that, orson, welles, once, said, that, other, film, makers, refused, to, shoot, in, the, region, out, of, fears, of, plagiarism, ford, typically, shot, only, the, footage, he, needed, and, often, filmed, in, sequence, minimizing, the, job, of, his, film, editors, in, the, opinion, of, joseph, mcbride, ford, s, technique, of, cutting, in, the, camera, enabled, him, to, retain, creative, control, in, a, period, where, directors, often, had, little, say, on, the, final, editing, of, their, films, ford, noted, i, don, t, give, em, a, lot, of, film, to, play, with, in, fact, eastman, used, to, complain, that, i, exposed, so, little, film, i, do, cut, in, the, camera, otherwise, if, you, give, them, a, lot, of, film, the, committee, takes, over, they, start, juggling, scenes, around, and, taking, out, this, and, putting, in, that, they, can, t, do, it, with, my, pictures, i, cut, in, the, camera, and, that, s, it, there, s, not, a, lot, of, film, left, on, the, floor, when, i, m, finished, ford, won, a, total, of, four, academy, awards, with, all, of, them, being, for, best, director, for, the, films, the, informer, 1935, the, grapes, of, wrath, 1940, how, green, was, my, valley, 1941, and, the, quiet, man, 1952, none, of, them, westerns, also, starring, in, the, last, two, was, maureen, o, hara, his, favorite, actress, he, was, also, nominated, as, best, director, for, stagecoach, 1939, he, later, directed, two, documentaries, the, battle, of, midway, and, december, 7, which, both, won, best, documentary, although, the, award, was, not, won, by, him, to, this, day, ford, holds, the, record, for, winning, the, most, best, director, oscars, having, won, the, award, on, four, occasions, william, wyler, and, frank, capra, come, in, second, having, won, the, award, three, times, ford, was, the, first, director, to, win, consecutive, best, director, awards, in, 1940, and, 1941, this, feat, was, later, matched, by, joseph, l, mankiewicz, exactly, ten, years, later, when, he, won, consecutive, awards, for, best, director, in, 1950, and, 1951, as, a, producer, he, also, received, a, nomination, for, best, picture, for, the, quiet, man, in, 1955, and, 1957, ford, was, awarded,

legend, of, the, american, west, in, films, like, stagecoach, 1939, the, grapes, of, wrath, 1940, the, man, who, shot, liberty, valance, 1962, and, cheyenne, autumn, 1964, the, academy, film, archive, has, preserved, a, number, of, john, ford, s, films, including, how, green, was, my, valley, the, battle, of, midway, drums, along, the, mohawk, sex, hygiene, torpedo, squadron, 8, and, four, sons, early, in, life, ford, s, politics, were, conventionally, progressive, his, favorite, presidents, were, democrats, franklin, d, roosevelt, john, f, kennedy, and, republican, abraham, lincoln, but, despite, these, leanings, many, thought, he, was, a, republican, because, of, his, long, association, with, actors, john, wayne, james, stewart, maureen, o, hara, and, ward, bond, ford, s, attitude, to, mccarthyism, in, hollywood, is, expressed, by, a, story, told, by, joseph, l, mankiewicz, a, faction, of, the, directors, guild, of, america, led, by, cecil, b, demille, had, tried, to, make, it, mandatory, for, every, member, to, sign, a, loyalty, oath, a, whispering, campaign, was, being, conducted, against, mankiewicz, then, president, of, the, guild, alleging, he, had, communist, sympathies, at, a, crucial, meeting, of, the, guild, demille, s, faction, spoke, for, four, hours, until, ford, spoke, against, demille, and, proposed, a, vote, of, confidence, in, mankiewicz, which, was, passed, his, words, were, recorded, by, a, stenographer, my, name, s, john, ford, i, make, westerns, i, don, t, think, there, s, anyone, in, this, room, who, knows, more, about, what, the, american, public, wants, than, cecil, b, demille, and, he, certainly, knows, how, to, give, it, to, them, but, i, don, t, like, you, c, b, i, don, t, like, what, you, stand, for, and, i, don, t, like, what, you, ve, been, saying, here, tonight, mankiewicz, s, version, of, events, was, contested, in, 2016, with, the, discovery, of, the, court, transcript, which, was, released, as, part, of, the, mankiewicz, archives, mankiewicz, s, account, gives, sole, credit, to, ford, in, sinking, demille, the, account, has, several, embellishments, demille, s, move, to, fire, mankiewicz, had, caused, a, storm, of, protest, demille, was, basically, on, the, receiving, end, of, a, torrent, of, attacks, from, many, speakers, throughout, the, meeting, and, at, one, point, looked, like, being, solely, thrown, off, the, guild, board, at, this, point, ford, rose, to, speak, his, opening, was, that, he, rose, in, defense, of, the, board, he, claimed, a, personal, role, in, a, vote, of, confidence, for, joseph, mankiewicz, he, then, called, for, an, end, to, politics, in, the, guild, and, for, it, to, refocus, on, working, conditions, ford, told, the, meeting, that, the, guild, was, formed, to, protect, ourselves, against, producers, ford, argued, against, putting, out, derogatory, information, about, a, director, whether, he, is, a, communist, beats, his, mother, in, law, or, beats, dogs, ford, wanted, the, debate, and, the, meeting, to, end, as, his, focus, was, the, unity, of, the, guild, he, said, that, mankiewicz, had, been, vilified, and, deserved, an, apology, his, final, section, was, to, support, demille, against, further, calls, for, his, resignation, ford, s, words, about, demille, were, and, i, think, that, some, of, the, accusations, made, here, tonight, were, pretty, unamerican, i, mean, a, group, of, men, have, picked, on, probably, the, dean, of, our, profession, i, don, t, agree, with, c, b, demille, i, admire, him, i, don, t, like, him, but, i, admire, him, everything, he, said, tonight, he, had, a, right, to, say, i, don, t, like, to, hear, accusations, against, him, he, concluded, by, pleading, with, the, membership, to, retain, demille, ford, feared, that, demille, s, exit, might, have, caused, the, body, to, disintegrate, his, second, move, was, to, have, the, entire, board, resign, which, saved, face, for, demille, and, allowed, the, issue, to, be, settled, without, forced, resignations, the, next, day, ford, wrote, a, letter, supporting, demille, and, then, telephoned, where, ford, described, demille, as, a, magnificent, figure, so, far, above, that, goddamn, pack, of, rats, at, a, heated, and, arduous, meeting, ford, went, to, the, defense, of, a, colleague, under, sustained, attack, from, his, peers, he, saw, the, dangers, of, expelling, demille, ford, stared, down, the, entire, meeting, to, ensure, that, demille, remained, in, the, guild, he, then, later, offered, his, own, resignation, as, part, of, the, entire, board, to, ensure, that, the, guild, did, not, break, and, allowed, demille, to, go, without, losing, face, as, time, went, on, however, ford, became, more, publicly, allied, with, the, republican, party, declaring, himself, a, maine, republican, in, 1947, he, said, he, voted, for, barry, goldwater, in, the, 1964, united, states, presidential, election, and, supported, richard, nixon, in, 1968, and, became, a, supporter, of, the, vietnam, war, in, 1973, he, was, awarded, the, medal, of, freedom, by, president, nixon, whose, campaign, he, had, publicly, supported, in, 1952, ford, hoped, for, a, robert, taft, douglas, macarthur, republican, presidential, ticket, when, dwight, eisenhower, won, the, nomination, ford, wrote, to, taft, saying, that, like, a, million, other, americans, i, am, naturally, bewildered, and, hurt, by, the, outcome, of, the, republican, convention, in, chicago, in, 1966, he, supported, ronald, reagan, in, his, governor, s, race, and, again, for, his, reelection, in, 1970, ford, scholar, tag, gallagher, asserts, that, ford, was, essentially, apolitical, although, he, also, notes, that, the, director, became, an, ardent, supporter, of, the, irish, republican, army, after, his, first, visit, to, ireland, in, the, 1920s, and, that, he, channelled, funds, to, the, ira, for, the, rest, of, his, career, 29, 339, ford, is, widely, considered, to, be, among, the, most, influential, of, hollywood, s, filmmakers, he, was, listed, as, the, sixth, most, influential, director, of, all, time, by, flickside, below, are, some, of, the, people, who, were, directly, influenced, by, ford, or, greatly, admired, his, work, in, december, 2011, the, irish, film, television, academy, ifta, in, association, with, the, john, ford, estate, and, the, irish, department, of, arts, heritage, and, the, gaeltacht, established, john, ford, ireland, celebrating, the, work, and, legacy, of, john, ford, the, irish, academy, stated, that, through, john, ford, ireland, they, hope,
