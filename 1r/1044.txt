learned, rhetoric, by, studying, the, speeches, of, previous, great, orators, he, delivered, his, first, judicial, speeches, at, the, age, of, 20, in, which, he, successfully, argued, that, he, should, gain, from, his, guardians, what, was, left, of, his, inheritance, for, a, time, demosthenes, made, his, living, as, a, professional, speechwriter, logographer, and, a, lawyer, writing, speeches, for, use, in, private, legal, suits, demosthenes, grew, interested, in, politics, during, his, time, as, a, logographer, and, in, 354, bc, he, gave, his, first, public, political, speeches, he, went, on, to, devote, his, most, productive, years, to, opposing, macedon, s, expansion, he, idealized, his, city, and, strove, throughout, his, life, to, restore, athens, supremacy, and, motivate, his, compatriots, against, philip, ii, of, macedon, he, sought, to, preserve, his, city, s, freedom, and, to, establish, an, alliance, against, macedon, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, impede, philip, s, plans, to, expand, his, influence, southward, conquering, the, greek, states, after, philip, s, death, demosthenes, played, a, leading, part, in, his, city, s, uprising, against, the, new, king, of, macedonia, alexander, the, great, however, his, efforts, failed, and, the, revolt, was, met, with, a, harsh, macedonian, reaction, to, prevent, a, similar, revolt, against, his, own, rule, alexander, s, successor, in, this, region, antipater, sent, his, men, to, track, demosthenes, down, demosthenes, killed, himself, to, avoid, being, arrested, by, archias, of, thurii, antipater, s, confidant, the, alexandrian, canon, compiled, by, aristophanes, of, byzantium, and, aristarchus, of, samothrace, called, demosthenes, one, of, the, ten, greatest, attic, orators, and, logographers, longinus, likened, demosthenes, to, a, blazing, thunderbolt, and, argued, that, he, had, perfected, to, the, utmost, the, tone, of, lofty, speech, living, passions, copiousness, readiness, speed, quintilian, extolled, him, as, lex, orandi, the, standard, of, oratory, cicero, said, of, him, that, inter, omnis, unus, excellat, one, exceeds, among, all, and, also, praised, him, as, the, perfect, orator, who, lacked, nothing, demosthenes, was, born, in, 384, bc, during, the, last, year, of, the, 98th, olympiad, or, the, first, year, of, the, 99th, olympiad, his, father, also, named, demosthenes, who, belonged, to, the, local, tribe, pandionis, and, lived, in, the, deme, of, paeania, in, the, athenian, countryside, was, a, wealthy, sword, maker, aeschines, demosthenes, greatest, political, rival, maintained, that, his, mother, kleoboule, was, a, scythian, by, blood, an, allegation, disputed, by, some, modern, scholars, he, was, also, the, uncle, of, the, athenian, orator, demochares, demosthenes, was, orphaned, at, the, age, of, seven, although, his, father, provided, for, him, well, his, legal, guardians, aphobus, demophon, and, therippides, mishandled, his, inheritance, demosthenes, started, to, learn, rhetoric, because, he, wished, to, take, his, guardians, to, court, and, because, he, was, of, delicate, physique, and, could, not, receive, gymnastic, education, which, was, customary, in, parallel, lives, plutarch, states, that, demosthenes, built, an, underground, study, where, he, practised, speaking, and, shaving, one, half, of, his, head, so, that, he, could, not, go, out, in, public, plutarch, also, states, that, he, had, an, inarticulate, and, stammering, pronunciation, that, he, overcame, by, speaking, with, pebbles, in, his, mouth, and, by, repeating, verses, when, running, or, out, of, breath, he, also, practised, speaking, in, front, of, a, large, mirror, as, soon, as, demosthenes, came, of, age, in, 366, bc, he, demanded, his, guardians, render, an, account, of, their, management, according, to, demosthenes, the, account, revealed, the, misappropriation, of, his, property, although, his, father, left, an, estate, of, nearly, fourteen, talents, equivalent, to, about, 220, years, of, a, labourer, s, income, at, standard, wages, or, 11, million, dollars, in, terms, of, median, u, s, annual, incomes, demosthenes, asserted, his, guardians, had, left, nothing, except, the, house, and, fourteen, slaves, and, thirty, silver, minae, 30, minae, talent, at, the, age, of, 20, demosthenes, sued, his, trustees, to, recover, his, patrimony, and, delivered, five, orations, three, against, aphobus, during, 363, and, 362, bc, and, two, against, onetor, during, 362, and, 361, bc, the, courts, fixed, demosthenes, damages, at, ten, talents, when, all, the, trials, came, to, an, end, he, only, succeeded, in, retrieving, a, portion, of, his, inheritance, according, to, pseudo, plutarch, demosthenes, was, married, once, the, only, information, about, his, wife, whose, name, is, unknown, is, that, she, was, the, daughter, of, heliodorus, a, prominent, citizen, demosthenes, also, had, a, daughter, the, only, one, who, ever, called, him, father, according, to, aeschines, in, a, trenchant, remark, his, daughter, died, young, and, unmarried, a, few, days, before, philip, ii, s, death, in, his, speeches, aeschines, uses, pederastic, relations, of, demosthenes, as, a, means, to, attack, him, in, the, case, of, aristion, a, youth, from, plataea, who, lived, for, a, long, time, in, demosthenes, house, aeschines, mocks, the, scandalous, and, improper, relation, in, another, speech, aeschines, brings, up, the, pederastic, relation, of, his, opponent, with, a, boy, called, cnosion, the, slander, that, demosthenes, wife, also, slept, with, the, boy, suggests, that, the, relationship, was, contemporary, with, his, marriage, aeschines, claims, that, demosthenes, made, money, out, of, young, rich, men, such, as, aristarchus, the, son, of, moschus, whom, he, allegedly, deceived, with, the, pretence, that, he, could, make, him, a, great, orator, apparently, while, still, under, demosthenes, tutelage, aristarchus, killed, and, mutilated, a, certain, nicodemus, of, aphidna, aeschines, accused, demosthenes, of, complicity, in, the, murder, pointing, out, that, nicodemus, had, once, pressed, a, lawsuit, accusing, demosthenes, of, desertion, he, also, accused, demosthenes, of, having, been, such, a, bad, erastes, to, aristarchus, so, as, not, even, to, deserve, the, name, his, crime, according, to, aeschines, was, to, have, betrayed, his, eromenos, by, pillaging, his, estate, allegedly, pretending, to, be, in, love, with, the, youth, so, as, to, get, his, hands, on, the, boy, s, inheritance, nevertheless, the, story, of, demosthenes, relations, with, aristarchus, is, still, regarded, as, more, than, doubtful, and, no, other, pupil, of, demosthenes, is, known, by, name, between, his, coming, of, age, in, 366, bc, and, the, trials, that, took, place, in, 364, bc, demosthenes, and, his, guardians, negotiated, acrimoniously, but, were, unable, to, reach, an, agreement, for, neither, side, was, willing, to, make, concessions, at, the, same, time, demosthenes, prepared, himself, for, the, trials, and, improved, his, oratory, skill, according, to, a, story, repeated, by, plutarch, when, demosthenes, was, an, adolescent, his, curiosity, was, noticed, by, the, orator, callistratus, who, was, then, at, the, height, of, his, reputation, having, just, won, a, case, of, considerable, importance, according, to, friedrich, nietzsche, a, german, philologist, and, philosopher, and, constantine, paparrigopoulos, a, major, modern, greek, historian, demosthenes, was, a, student, of, isocrates, according, to, cicero, quintillian, and, the, roman, biographer, hermippus, he, was, a, student, of, plato, lucian, a, roman, syrian, rhetorician, and, satirist, lists, the, philosophers, aristotle, theophrastus, and, xenocrates, among, his, teachers, these, claims, are, nowadays, disputed, according, to, plutarch, demosthenes, employed, isaeus, as, his, master, in, rhetoric, even, though, isocrates, was, then, teaching, this, subject, either, because, he, could, not, pay, isocrates, the, prescribed, fee, or, because, demosthenes, believed, isaeus, style, better, suited, a, vigorous, and, astute, orator, such, as, himself, curtius, a, german, archaeologist, and, historian, likened, the, relation, between, isaeus, and, demosthenes, to, an, intellectual, armed, alliance, it, has, also, been, said, that, demosthenes, paid, isaeus, 10, 000, drachmae, somewhat, over, 1, talents, on, the, condition, that, isaeus, withdraw, from, a, school, of, rhetoric, he, had, opened, and, instead, devote, himself, wholly, to, demosthenes, his, new, pupil, another, version, credits, isaeus, with, having, taught, demosthenes, without, charge, according, to, sir, richard, c, jebb, a, british, classical, scholar, the, intercourse, between, isaeus, and, demosthenes, as, teacher, and, learner, can, scarcely, have, been, either, very, intimate, or, of, very, long, duration, konstantinos, tsatsos, a, greek, professor, and, academician, believes, that, isaeus, helped, demosthenes, edit, his, initial, judicial, orations, against, his, guardians, demosthenes, is, also, said, to, have, admired, the, historian, thucydides, in, the, illiterate, book, fancier, lucian, mentions, eight, beautiful, copies, of, thucydides, made, by, demosthenes, all, in, demosthenes, own, handwriting, these, references, hint, at, his, respect, for, a, historian, he, must, have, assiduously, studied, according, to, plutarch, when, demosthenes, first, addressed, himself, to, the, people, he, was, derided, for, his, strange, and, uncouth, style, which, was, cumbered, with, long, sentences, and, tortured, with, formal, arguments, to, a, most, harsh, and, disagreeable, excess, some, citizens, however, discerned, his, talent, when, he, first, left, the, ekklesia, the, athenian, assembly, disheartened, an, old, man, named, eunomus, encouraged, him, saying, his, diction, was, very, much, like, that, of, pericles, another, time, after, the, ekklesia, had, refused, to, hear, him, and, he, was, going, home, dejected, an, actor, named, satyrus, followed, him, and, entered, into, a, friendly, conversation, with, him, as, a, boy, demosthenes, had, a, speech, impairment, plutarch, refers, to, a, weakness, in, his, voice, of, a, perplexed, and, indistinct, utterance, and, a, shortness, of, breath, which, by, breaking, and, disjointing, his, sentences, much, obscured, the, sense, and, meaning, of, what, he, spoke, there, are, problems, in, plutarch, s, account, however, and, it, is, probable, that, demosthenes, actually, suffered, from, rhotacism, mispronouncing, r, as, l, aeschines, taunted, him, and, referred, to, him, in, his, speeches, by, the, nickname, batalus, apparently, invented, by, demosthenes, pedagogues, or, by, the, little, boys, with, whom, he, was, playing, which, corresponded, to, how, someone, with, that, variety, of, rhotacism, would, pronounce, battaros, the, name, of, a, legendary, libyan, king, who, spoke, quickly, and, in, a, disordered, fashion, demosthenes, undertook, a, disciplined, programme, to, overcome, his, weaknesses, and, improve, his, delivery, including, diction, voice, and, gestures, according, to, one, story, when, he, was, asked, to, name, the, three, most, important, elements, in, oratory, he, replied, delivery, delivery, and, delivery, it, is, unknown, whether, such, vignettes, are, factual, accounts, of, events, in, demosthenes, life, or, merely, anecdotes, used, to, illustrate, his, perseverance, and, determination, to, make, his, living, demosthenes, became, a, professional, litigant, both, as, a, logographer, logographos, writing, speeches, for, use, in, private, legal, suits, and, as, an, advocate, sun, goros, speaking, on, another, s, behalf, he, seems, to, have, been, able, to, manage, any, kind, of, case, adapting, his, skills, to, almost, any, client, including, wealthy, and, powerful, men, it, is, not, unlikely, that, he, became, a, teacher, of, rhetoric, and, that, he, brought, pupils, into, court, with, him, however, though, he, probably, continued, writing, speeches, throughout, his, career, he, stopped, working, as, an, advocate, once, he, entered, the, political, arena, judicial, oratory, had, become, a, significant, literary, genre, by, the, second, half, of, the, fifth, century, as, represented, in, the, speeches, of, demosthenes, predecessors, antiphon, and, andocides, logographers, were, a, unique, aspect, of, the, athenian, justice, system, evidence, for, a, case, was, compiled, by, a, magistrate, in, a, preliminary, hearing, and, litigants, could, present, it, as, they, pleased, within, set, speeches, however, witnesses, and, documents, were, popularly, mistrusted, since, they, could, be, secured, by, force, or, bribery, there, was, little, cross, examination, during, the, trial, there, were, no, instructions, to, the, jury, from, a, judge, no, conferencing, between, jurists, before, voting, the, juries, were, huge, typically, between, 201, and, 501, members, cases, depended, largely, on, questions, of, probable, motive, and, notions, of, natural, justice, were, felt, to, take, precedence, over, written, law, conditions, that, favoured, artfully, constructed, speeches, since, athenian, politicians, were, often, indicted, by, their, opponents, there, was, not, always, a, clear, distinction, between, private, and, public, cases, and, thus, a, career, as, a, logographer, opened, the, way, for, demosthenes, to, embark, on, his, political, career, an, athenian, logographer, could, remain, anonymous, which, enabled, him, to, serve, personal, interests, even, if, it, prejudiced, the, client, it, also, left, him, open, to, allegations, of, malpractice, thus, for, example, aeschines, accused, demosthenes, of, unethically, disclosing, his, clients, arguments, to, their, opponents, in, particular, that, he, wrote, a, speech, for, phormion, 350, bc, a, wealthy, banker, and, then, communicated, it, to, apollodorus, who, was, bringing, a, capital, charge, against, phormion, plutarch, much, later, supported, this, accusation, stating, that, demosthenes, was, thought, to, have, acted, dishonourably, and, he, also, accused, demosthenes, of, writing, speeches, for, both, sides, it, has, often, been, argued, that, the, deception, if, there, was, one, involved, a, political, quid, pro, quo, whereby, apollodorus, secretly, pledged, support, for, unpopular, reforms, that, demosthenes, was, pursuing, in, the, greater, public, interest, i, e, the, diversion, of, theoric, funds, to, military, purposes, demosthenes, was, admitted, to, his, d, mos, as, a, citizen, with, full, rights, probably, in, 366, bc, and, he, soon, demonstrated, an, interest, in, politics, in, 363, and, 359, bc, he, assumed, the, office, of, the, trierarch, being, responsible, for, the, outfitting, and, maintenance, of, a, trireme, he, was, among, the, first, ever, volunteer, trierarchs, in, 357, bc, sharing, the, expenses, of, a, ship, called, dawn, for, which, the, public, inscription, still, survives, in, 348, bc, he, became, a, choregos, paying, the, expenses, of, a, theatrical, production, between, 355, and, 351, bc, demosthenes, continued, practising, law, privately, while, he, was, becoming, increasingly, interested, in, public, affairs, during, this, period, he, wrote, against, androtion, and, against, leptines, two, fierce, attacks, on, individuals, who, attempted, to, repeal, certain, tax, exemptions, in, against, timocrates, and, against, aristocrates, he, advocated, eliminating, corruption, all, these, speeches, which, offer, early, glimpses, of, his, general, principles, on, foreign, policy, such, as, the, importance, of, the, navy, of, alliances, and, of, national, honour, are, prosecutions, graph, paran, m, n, against, individuals, accused, of, illegally, proposing, legislative, texts, in, demosthenes, time, different, political, goals, developed, around, personalities, instead, of, electioneering, athenian, politicians, used, litigation, and, defamation, to, remove, rivals, from, government, processes, often, they, indicted, each, other, for, breaches, of, the, statute, laws, graph, paran, m, n, but, accusations, of, bribery, and, corruption, were, ubiquitous, in, all, cases, being, part, of, the, political, dialogue, the, orators, often, resorted, to, character, assassination, tactics, diabol, loidor, a, both, in, the, courts, and, in, the, assembly, the, rancorous, and, often, hilariously, exaggerated, accusations, satirised, by, old, comedy, were, sustained, by, innuendo, inferences, about, motives, and, a, complete, absence, of, proof, as, j, h, vince, states, there, was, no, room, for, chivalry, in, athenian, political, life, such, rivalry, enabled, the, demos, citizen, body, to, reign, supreme, as, judge, jury, and, executioner, demosthenes, was, to, become, fully, engaged, in, this, kind, of, litigation, and, he, was, also, to, be, instrumental, in, developing, the, power, of, the, areopagus, to, indict, individuals, for, treason, invoked, in, the, ekklesia, by, a, process, called, ap, phasis, in, 354, bc, demosthenes, delivered, his, first, political, oration, on, the, navy, in, which, he, espoused, moderation, and, proposed, the, reform, of, the, symmoriai, boards, as, a, source, of, funding, for, the, athenian, fleet, in, 352, bc, he, delivered, for, the, megalopolitans, and, in, 351, bc, on, the, liberty, of, the, rhodians, in, both, speeches, he, opposed, eubulus, the, most, powerful, athenian, statesman, of, the, period, 355, to, 342, bc, the, latter, was, no, pacifist, but, came, to, eschew, a, policy, of, aggressive, interventionism, in, the, internal, affairs, of, the, other, greek, cities, contrary, to, eubulus, policy, demosthenes, called, for, an, alliance, with, megalopolis, against, sparta, or, thebes, and, for, supporting, the, democratic, faction, of, the, rhodians, in, their, internal, strife, his, arguments, revealed, his, desire, to, articulate, athens, needs, and, interests, through, a, more, activist, foreign, policy, wherever, opportunity, might, provide, although, his, early, orations, were, unsuccessful, and, reveal, a, lack, of, real, conviction, and, of, coherent, strategic, and, political, prioritisation, demosthenes, established, himself, as, an, important, political, personality, and, broke, with, eubulus, faction, of, which, a, prominent, member, was, aeschines, he, thus, laid, the, foundations, for, his, future, political, successes, and, for, becoming, the, leader, of, his, own, party, the, issue, of, whether, the, modern, concept, of, political, parties, can, be, applied, in, the, athenian, democracy, is, hotly, disputed, among, modern, scholars, most, of, demosthenes, major, orations, were, directed, against, the, growing, power, of, king, philip, ii, of, macedon, since, 357, bc, when, philip, seized, amphipolis, and, pydna, athens, had, been, formally, at, war, with, the, macedonians, in, 352, bc, demosthenes, characterised, philip, as, the, very, worst, enemy, of, his, city, his, speech, presaged, the, fierce, attacks, that, demosthenes, would, launch, against, the, macedonian, king, over, the, ensuing, years, a, year, later, he, criticised, those, dismissing, philip, as, a, person, of, no, account, and, warned, that, he, was, as, dangerous, as, the, king, of, persia, in, 352, bc, athenian, troops, successfully, opposed, philip, at, thermopylae, but, the, macedonian, victory, over, the, phocians, at, the, battle, of, crocus, field, shook, demosthenes, in, 351, bc, demosthenes, felt, strong, enough, to, express, his, view, concerning, the, most, important, foreign, policy, issue, facing, athens, at, that, time, the, stance, his, city, should, take, towards, philip, according, to, jacqueline, de, romilly, a, french, philologist, and, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, the, threat, of, philip, would, give, demosthenes, stances, a, focus, and, a, raison, d, tre, demosthenes, saw, the, king, of, macedon, as, a, menace, to, the, autonomy, of, all, greek, cities, and, yet, he, presented, him, as, a, monster, of, athens, s, own, creation, in, the, first, philippic, he, reprimanded, his, fellow, citizens, as, follows, even, if, something, happens, to, him, you, will, soon, raise, up, a, second, philip, the, theme, of, the, first, philippic, 351, 350, bc, was, preparedness, and, the, reform, of, the, theoric, fund, a, mainstay, of, eubulus, policy, in, his, rousing, call, for, resistance, demosthenes, asked, his, countrymen, to, take, the, necessary, action, and, asserted, that, for, a, free, people, there, can, be, no, greater, compulsion, than, shame, for, their, position, he, thus, provided, for, the, first, time, a, plan, and, specific, recommendations, for, the, strategy, to, be, adopted, against, philip, in, the, north, among, other, things, the, plan, called, for, the, creation, of, a, rapid, response, force, to, be, created, cheaply, with, each, hopl, t, s, to, be, paid, only, ten, drachmas, per, month, two, obols, per, day, which, was, less, than, the, average, pay, for, unskilled, labourers, in, athens, implying, that, the, hoplite, was, expected, to, make, up, the, deficiency, in, pay, by, looting, from, this, moment, until, 341, bc, all, of, demosthenes, speeches, referred, to, the, same, issue, the, struggle, against, philip, in, 349, bc, philip, attacked, olynthus, an, ally, of, athens, in, the, three, olynthiacs, demosthenes, criticised, his, compatriots, for, being, idle, and, urged, athens, to, help, olynthus, he, also, insulted, philip, by, calling, him, a, barbarian, despite, demosthenes, strong, advocacy, the, athenians, would, not, manage, to, prevent, the, falling, of, the, city, to, the, macedonians, almost, simultaneously, probably, on, eubulus, recommendation, they, engaged, in, a, war, in, euboea, against, philip, which, ended, in, a, stalemate, in, 348, bc, a, peculiar, event, occurred, meidias, a, wealthy, athenian, publicly, slapped, demosthenes, who, was, at, the, time, a, choregos, at, the, greater, dionysia, a, large, religious, festival, in, honour, of, the, god, dionysus, meidias, was, a, friend, of, eubulus, and, supporter, of, the, unsuccessful, excursion, in, euboea, he, also, was, an, old, enemy, of, demosthenes, in, 361, bc, he, had, broken, violently, into, his, house, with, his, brother, thrasylochus, to, take, possession, of, it, demosthenes, decided, to, prosecute, his, wealthy, opponent, and, wrote, the, judicial, oration, against, meidias, this, speech, gives, valuable, information, about, athenian, law, at, the, time, and, especially, about, the, greek, concept, of, hybris, aggravated, assault, which, was, regarded, as, a, crime, not, only, against, the, city, but, against, society, as, a, whole, he, stated, that, a, democratic, state, perishes, if, the, rule, of, law, is, undermined, by, wealthy, and, unscrupulous, men, and, that, the, citizens, acquire, power, and, authority, in, all, state, affairs, due, to, the, strength, of, the, laws, there, is, no, consensus, among, scholars, either, on, whether, demosthenes, finally, delivered, against, meidias, or, on, the, veracity, of, aeschines, accusation, that, demosthenes, was, bribed, to, drop, the, charges, in, 348, bc, philip, conquered, olynthus, and, razed, it, to, the, ground, then, conquered, the, entire, chalcidice, and, all, the, states, of, the, chalcidic, federation, that, olynthus, had, once, led, after, these, macedonian, victories, athens, sued, for, peace, with, macedon, demosthenes, was, among, those, who, favoured, compromise, in, 347, bc, an, athenian, delegation, comprising, demosthenes, aeschines, and, philocrates, was, officially, sent, to, pella, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, in, his, first, encounter, with, philip, demosthenes, is, said, to, have, collapsed, from, fright, the, ekklesia, officially, accepted, philip, s, harsh, terms, including, the, renouncement, of, their, claim, to, amphipolis, however, when, an, athenian, delegation, arrived, at, pella, to, put, philip, under, oath, which, was, required, to, conclude, the, treaty, he, was, campaigning, abroad, he, expected, that, he, would, hold, safely, any, athenian, possessions, that, he, might, seize, before, the, ratification, being, very, anxious, about, the, delay, demosthenes, insisted, that, the, embassy, should, travel, to, the, place, where, they, would, find, philip, and, swear, him, in, without, delay, despite, his, suggestions, the, athenian, envoys, including, himself, and, aeschines, remained, in, pella, until, philip, successfully, concluded, his, campaign, in, thrace, philip, swore, to, the, treaty, but, he, delayed, the, departure, of, the, athenian, envoys, who, had, yet, to, receive, the, oaths, from, macedon, s, allies, in, thessaly, and, elsewhere, finally, peace, was, sworn, at, pherae, where, philip, accompanied, the, athenian, delegation, after, he, had, completed, his, military, preparations, to, move, south, demosthenes, accused, the, other, envoys, of, venality, and, of, facilitating, philip, s, plans, with, their, stance, just, after, the, conclusion, of, the, peace, of, philocrates, philip, passed, thermopylae, and, subdued, phocis, athens, made, no, move, to, support, the, phocians, supported, by, thebes, and, thessaly, macedon, took, control, of, phocis, votes, in, the, amphictyonic, league, a, greek, religious, organisation, formed, to, support, the, greater, temples, of, apollo, and, demeter, despite, some, reluctance, on, the, part, of, the, athenian, leaders, athens, finally, accepted, philip, s, entry, into, the, council, of, the, league, demosthenes, was, among, those, who, adopted, a, pragmatic, approach, and, recommended, this, stance, in, his, oration, on, the, peace, for, edmund, m, burke, this, speech, heralds, a, maturation, in, demosthenes, career, after, philip, s, successful, campaign, in, 346, bc, the, athenian, statesman, realised, that, if, he, was, to, lead, his, city, against, the, macedonians, he, had, to, adjust, his, voice, to, become, less, partisan, in, tone, in, 344, bc, demosthenes, travelled, to, the, peloponnese, to, detach, as, many, cities, as, possible, from, macedon, s, influence, but, his, efforts, were, generally, unsuccessful, most, of, the, peloponnesians, saw, philip, as, the, guarantor, of, their, freedom, and, sent, a, joint, embassy, to, athens, to, express, their, grievances, against, demosthenes, activities, in, response, demosthenes, delivered, the, second, philippic, a, vehement, attack, against, philip, in, 343, bc, demosthenes, delivered, on, the, false, embassy, against, aeschines, who, was, facing, a, charge, of, high, treason, nonetheless, aeschines, was, acquitted, by, the, narrow, margin, of, thirty, votes, by, a, jury, which, may, have, numbered, as, many, as, 1, 501, in, 343, bc, macedonian, forces, were, conducting, campaigns, in, epirus, and, in, 342, bc, philip, campaigned, in, thrace, he, also, negotiated, with, the, athenians, an, amendment, to, the, peace, of, philocrates, when, the, macedonian, army, approached, chersonese, now, known, as, the, gallipoli, peninsula, an, athenian, general, named, diopeithes, ravaged, the, maritime, district, of, thrace, thereby, inciting, philip, s, rage, because, of, this, turbulence, the, athenian, assembly, convened, demosthenes, delivered, on, the, chersonese, and, convinced, the, athenians, not, to, recall, diopeithes, also, in, 342, bc, he, delivered, the, third, philippic, which, is, considered, to, be, the, best, of, his, political, orations, using, all, the, power, of, his, eloquence, he, demanded, resolute, action, against, philip, and, called, for, a, burst, of, energy, from, the, athenian, people, he, told, them, that, it, would, be, better, to, die, a, thousand, times, than, pay, court, to, philip, demosthenes, now, dominated, athenian, politics, and, was, able, to, considerably, weaken, the, pro, macedonian, faction, of, aeschines, in, 341, bc, demosthenes, was, sent, to, byzantium, where, he, sought, to, renew, its, alliance, with, athens, thanks, to, demosthenes, diplomatic, manoeuvres, abydos, also, entered, into, an, alliance, with, athens, these, developments, worried, philip, and, increased, his, anger, at, demosthenes, the, assembly, however, laid, aside, philip, s, grievances, against, demosthenes, conduct, and, denounced, the, peace, treaty, so, doing, in, effect, amounted, to, an, official, declaration, of, war, in, 339, bc, philip, made, his, last, and, most, effective, bid, to, conquer, southern, greece, assisted, by, aeschines, stance, in, the, amphictyonic, council, during, a, meeting, of, the, council, philip, accused, the, amfissian, locrians, of, intruding, on, consecrated, ground, the, presiding, officer, of, the, council, a, thessalian, named, cottyphus, proposed, the, convocation, of, an, amphictyonic, congress, to, inflict, a, harsh, punishment, upon, the, locrians, aeschines, agreed, with, this, proposition, and, maintained, that, the, athenians, should, participate, in, the, congress, demosthenes, however, reversed, aeschines, initiatives, and, athens, finally, abstained, after, the, failure, of, a, first, military, excursion, against, the, locrians, the, summer, session, of, the, amphictyonic, council, gave, command, of, the, league, s, forces, to, philip, and, asked, him, to, lead, a, second, excursion, philip, decided, to, act, at, once, in, the, winter, of, 339, 338, bc, he, passed, through, thermopylae, entered, amfissa, and, defeated, the, locrians, after, this, significant, victory, philip, swiftly, entered, phocis, in, 338, bc, he, then, turned, south, east, down, the, cephissus, valley, seized, elateia, and, restored, the, fortifications, of, the, city, at, the, same, time, athens, orchestrated, the, creation, of, an, alliance, with, euboea, megara, achaea, corinth, acarnania, and, other, states, in, the, peloponnese, however, the, most, desirable, ally, for, athens, was, thebes, to, secure, their, allegiance, demosthenes, was, sent, by, athens, to, the, boeotian, city, philip, also, sent, a, deputation, but, demosthenes, succeeded, in, securing, thebes, allegiance, demosthenes, oration, before, the, theban, people, is, not, extant, and, therefore, the, arguments, he, used, to, convince, the, thebans, remain, unknown, in, any, case, the, alliance, came, at, a, price, thebes, control, of, boeotia, was, recognised, thebes, was, to, command, solely, on, land, and, jointly, at, sea, and, athens, was, to, pay, two, thirds, of, the, campaign, s, cost, while, the, athenians, and, the, thebans, were, preparing, themselves, for, war, philip, made, a, final, attempt, to, appease, his, enemies, proposing, in, vain, a, new, peace, treaty, after, a, few, trivial, encounters, between, the, two, sides, which, resulted, in, minor, athenian, victories, philip, drew, the, phalanx, of, the, athenian, and, theban, confederates, into, a, plain, near, chaeronea, where, he, defeated, them, demosthenes, fought, as, a, mere, hoplite, such, was, philip, s, hatred, for, demosthenes, that, according, to, diodorus, siculus, the, king, after, his, victory, sneered, at, the, misfortunes, of, the, athenian, statesman, however, the, athenian, orator, and, statesman, demades, is, said, to, have, remarked, o, king, when, fortune, has, cast, you, in, the, role, of, agamemnon, are, you, not, ashamed, to, act, the, part, of, thersites, stung, by, these, words, philip, immediately, altered, his, demeanour, after, chaeronea, philip, inflicted, a, harsh, punishment, upon, thebes, but, made, peace, with, athens, on, very, lenient, terms, demosthenes, encouraged, the, fortification, of, athens, and, was, chosen, by, the, ekklesia, to, deliver, the, funeral, oration, in, 337, bc, philip, created, the, league, of, corinth, a, confederation, of, greek, states, under, his, leadership, and, returned, to, pella, in, 336, bc, philip, was, assassinated, at, the, wedding, of, his, daughter, cleopatra, of, macedon, to, king, alexander, of, epirus, the, macedonian, citizens, swiftly, proclaimed, alexander, iii, of, macedon, then, twenty, years, old, as, the, new, king, of, macedon, greek, cities, like, athens, and, thebes, saw, in, this, change, of, leadership, an, opportunity, to, regain, their, full, independence, demosthenes, celebrated, philip, s, assassination, and, played, a, leading, part, in, his, city, s, uprising, according, to, aeschines, it, was, but, the, seventh, day, after, the, death, of, his, daughter, and, though, the, ceremonies, of, mourning, were, not, yet, completed, he, put, a, garland, on, his, head, and, white, raiment, on, his, body, and, there, he, stood, making, thank, offerings, violating, all, decency, demosthenes, also, sent, envoys, to, attalus, whom, he, considered, to, be, an, internal, opponent, of, alexander, nonetheless, alexander, moved, swiftly, to, thebes, which, submitted, shortly, after, his, appearance, at, its, gates, when, the, athenians, learned, that, alexander, had, moved, quickly, to, boeotia, they, panicked, and, begged, the, new, king, of, macedon, for, mercy, alexander, admonished, them, but, imposed, no, punishment, in, 335, bc, alexander, felt, free, to, engage, the, thracians, and, the, illyrians, but, while, he, was, campaigning, in, the, north, demosthenes, spread, a, rumour, even, producing, a, bloodstained, messenger, that, alexander, and, all, of, his, expeditionary, force, had, been, slaughtered, by, the, triballians, the, thebans, and, the, athenians, rebelled, once, again, financed, by, darius, iii, of, persia, and, demosthenes, is, said, to, have, received, about, 300, talents, on, behalf, of, athens, and, to, have, faced, accusations, of, embezzlement, alexander, reacted, immediately, and, razed, thebes, to, the, ground, he, did, not, attack, athens, but, demanded, the, exile, of, all, anti, macedonian, politicians, demosthenes, first, of, all, according, to, plutarch, a, special, athenian, embassy, led, by, phocion, an, opponent, of, the, anti, macedonian, faction, was, able, to, persuade, alexander, to, relent, according, to, ancient, writers, demosthenes, called, alexander, margites, greek, and, a, boy, greeks, used, the, word, margites, to, describe, foolish, and, useless, people, on, account, of, the, margites, despite, the, unsuccessful, ventures, against, philip, and, alexander, most, athenians, still, respected, demosthenes, because, they, shared, his, sentiments, and, wished, to, restore, their, independence, in, 336, bc, the, orator, ctesiphon, proposed, that, athens, honour, demosthenes, for, his, services, to, the, city, by, presenting, him, according, to, custom, with, a, golden, crown, this, proposal, became, a, political, issue, and, in, 330, bc, aeschines, prosecuted, ctesiphon, on, charges, of, legal, irregularities, in, his, most, brilliant, speech, on, the, crown, demosthenes, effectively, defended, ctesiphon, and, vehemently, attacked, those, who, would, have, preferred, peace, with, macedon, he, was, unrepentant, about, his, past, actions, and, policies, and, insisted, that, when, in, power, the, constant, aim, of, his, policies, was, the, honour, and, the, ascendancy, of, his, country, and, on, every, occasion, and, in, all, business, he, preserved, his, loyalty, to, athens, he, finally, defeated, aeschines, although, his, enemy, s, objections, though, politically, motivated, to, the, crowning, were, arguably, valid, from, a, legal, point, of, view, in, 324, bc, harpalus, to, whom, alexander, had, entrusted, huge, treasures, absconded, and, sought, refuge, in, athens, the, assembly, had, initially, refused, to, accept, him, following, demosthenes, and, phocion, s, advice, but, finally, harpalus, entered, athens, he, was, imprisoned, after, a, proposal, of, demosthenes, and, phocion, despite, the, dissent, of, hypereides, an, anti, macedonian, statesman, and, former, ally, of, demosthenes, additionally, the, ekklesia, decided, to, take, control, of, harpalus, money, which, was, entrusted, to, a, committee, presided, over, by, demosthenes, when, the, committee, counted, the, treasure, they, found, they, only, had, half, the, money, harpalus, had, declared, he, possessed, when, harpalus, escaped, the, areopagus, conducted, an, inquiry, and, charged, demosthenes, and, others, with, mishandling, twenty, talents, among, the, accused, demosthenes, was, the, first, to, be, brought, to, trial, before, an, unusually, numerous, jury, of, 1, 500, he, was, found, guilty, and, fined, 50, talents, unable, to, pay, this, huge, amount, demosthenes, escaped, and, only, returned, to, athens, nine, months, later, after, the, death, of, alexander, upon, his, return, he, received, from, his, countrymen, an, enthusiastic, welcome, such, as, had, never, been, accorded, to, any, returning, exile, since, the, days, of, alkibiades, such, a, reception, the, circumstances, of, the, case, athenian, need, to, placate, alexander, the, urgency, to, account, for, the, missing, funds, demosthenes, patriotism, and, wish, to, set, greece, free, from, macedonian, rule, all, lend, support, to, george, grote, s, view, that, demosthenes, was, innocent, that, the, charges, against, him, were, politically, motivated, and, that, he, was, neither, paid, nor, bought, by, harpalus, mogens, hansen, however, notes, that, many, athenian, leaders, demosthenes, included, made, fortunes, out, of, their, political, activism, especially, by, taking, bribes, from, fellow, citizens, and, such, foreign, states, as, macedonia, and, persia, demosthenes, received, vast, sums, for, the, many, decrees, and, laws, he, proposed, given, this, pattern, of, corruption, in, greek, politics, it, appears, likely, writes, hansen, that, demosthenes, accepted, a, huge, bribe, from, harpalus, and, that, he, was, justly, found, guilty, in, an, athenian, people, s, court, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, demosthenes, again, urged, the, athenians, to, seek, independence, from, macedon, in, what, became, known, as, the, lamian, war, however, antipater, alexander, s, successor, quelled, all, opposition, and, demanded, that, the, athenians, turn, over, demosthenes, and, hypereides, among, others, following, his, order, the, ekklesia, had, no, choice, but, to, reluctantly, adopt, a, decree, condemning, the, most, prominent, anti, macedonian, agitators, to, death, demosthenes, escaped, to, a, sanctuary, on, the, island, of, kalaureia, modern, day, poros, where, he, was, later, discovered, by, archias, a, confidant, of, antipater, he, died, by, suicide, before, his, capture, by, taking, poison, out, of, a, reed, pretending, he, wanted, to, write, a, letter, to, his, family, when, demosthenes, felt, that, the, poison, was, working, on, his, body, he, said, to, archias, now, as, soon, as, you, please, you, may, commence, the, part, of, creon, in, the, tragedy, and, cast, out, this, body, of, mine, unburied, but, o, gracious, neptune, i, for, my, part, while, i, am, yet, alive, arise, up, and, depart, out, of, this, sacred, place, though, antipater, and, the, macedonians, have, not, left, so, much, as, the, temple, unpolluted, after, saying, these, words, he, passed, by, the, altar, fell, down, and, died, years, after, demosthenes, suicide, the, athenians, erected, a, statue, to, honour, him, and, decreed, that, the, state, should, provide, meals, to, his, descendants, in, the, prytaneum, plutarch, lauds, demosthenes, for, not, being, of, a, fickle, disposition, rebutting, historian, theopompus, the, biographer, insists, that, for, the, same, party, and, post, in, politics, which, he, held, from, the, beginning, to, these, he, kept, constant, to, the, end, and, was, so, far, from, leaving, them, while, he, lived, that, he, chose, rather, to, forsake, his, life, than, his, purpose, on, the, other, hand, polybius, a, greek, historian, of, the, mediterranean, world, was, highly, critical, of, demosthenes, policies, polybius, accused, him, of, having, launched, unjustified, verbal, attacks, on, great, men, of, other, cities, branding, them, unjustly, as, traitors, to, the, greeks, the, historian, maintains, that, demosthenes, measured, everything, by, the, interests, of, his, own, city, imagining, that, all, the, greeks, ought, to, have, their, eyes, fixed, upon, athens, according, to, polybius, the, only, thing, the, athenians, eventually, got, by, their, opposition, to, philip, was, the, defeat, at, chaeronea, and, had, it, not, been, for, the, king, s, magnanimity, and, regard, for, his, own, reputation, their, misfortunes, would, have, gone, even, further, thanks, to, the, policy, of, demosthenes, paparrigopoulos, extols, demosthenes, patriotism, but, criticises, him, as, being, short, sighted, according, to, this, critique, demosthenes, should, have, understood, that, the, ancient, greek, states, could, only, survive, unified, under, the, leadership, of, macedon, therefore, demosthenes, is, accused, of, misjudging, events, opponents, and, opportunities, and, of, being, unable, to, foresee, philip, s, inevitable, triumph, he, is, criticised, for, having, overrated, athens, s, capacity, to, revive, and, challenge, macedon, his, city, had, lost, most, of, its, aegean, allies, whereas, philip, had, consolidated, his, hold, over, macedonia, and, was, master, of, enormous, mineral, wealth, chris, carey, a, professor, of, greek, in, ucl, concludes, that, demosthenes, was, a, better, orator, and, political, operator, than, strategist, nevertheless, the, same, scholar, underscores, that, pragmatists, like, aeschines, or, phocion, had, no, inspiring, vision, to, rival, that, of, demosthenes, the, orator, asked, the, athenians, to, choose, that, which, is, just, and, honourable, before, their, own, safety, and, preservation, the, people, preferred, demosthenes, activism, and, even, the, bitter, defeat, at, chaeronea, was, regarded, as, a, price, worth, paying, in, the, attempt, to, retain, freedom, and, influence, according, to, professor, of, greek, arthur, wallace, pickarde, success, may, be, a, poor, criterion, for, judging, the, actions, of, people, like, demosthenes, who, were, motivated, by, the, ideals, of, democracy, political, liberty, athens, was, asked, by, philip, to, sacrifice, its, freedom, and, its, democracy, while, demosthenes, longed, for, the, city, s, brilliance, he, endeavoured, to, revive, its, imperilled, values, and, thus, he, became, an, educator, of, the, people, in, the, words, of, werner, jaeger, the, fact, that, demosthenes, fought, at, the, battle, of, chaeronea, as, a, hoplite, indicates, that, he, lacked, any, military, skills, according, to, historian, thomas, babington, macaulay, in, his, time, the, division, between, political, and, military, offices, was, beginning, to, be, strongly, marked, almost, no, politician, with, the, exception, of, phocion, was, at, the, same, time, an, apt, orator, and, a, competent, general, demosthenes, dealt, in, policies, and, ideas, and, war, was, not, his, business, this, contrast, between, demosthenes, intellectual, prowess, and, his, deficiencies, in, terms, of, vigour, stamina, military, skill, and, strategic, vision, is, illustrated, by, the, inscription, his, countrymen, engraved, on, the, base, of, his, statue, had, you, for, greece, been, strong, as, wise, you, were, the, macedonian, would, not, have, conquered, her, george, grote, notes, that, already, thirty, years, before, his, death, demosthenes, took, a, sagacious, and, provident, measure, of, the, danger, which, threatened, grecian, liberty, from, the, energy, and, encroachments, of, philip, throughout, his, career, we, trace, the, same, combination, of, earnest, patriotism, with, wise, and, long, sighted, policy, had, his, advice, to, the, athenians, and, other, fellow, greeks, been, followed, the, power, of, macedonia, could, have, been, successfully, checked, moreover, says, grote, it, was, not, athens, only, that, he, sought, to, defend, against, philip, but, the, whole, hellenic, world, in, this, he, towers, above, the, greatest, of, his, predecessors, the, sentiments, to, which, demosthenes, appeals, throughout, his, numerous, orations, are, those, of, the, noblest, and, largest, patriotism, trying, to, inflame, the, ancient, grecian, sentiment, of, an, autonomous, hellenic, world, as, the, indispensable, condition, of, a, dignified, and, desirable, existence, in, demosthenes, initial, judicial, orations, the, influence, of, both, lysias, and, isaeus, is, obvious, but, his, marked, original, style, is, already, revealed, most, of, his, extant, speeches, for, private, cases, written, early, in, his, career, show, glimpses, of, talent, a, powerful, intellectual, drive, masterly, selection, and, omission, of, facts, and, a, confident, assertion, of, the, justice, of, his, case, all, ensuring, the, dominance, of, his, viewpoint, over, his, rival, however, at, this, early, stage, of, his, career, his, writing, was, not, yet, remarkable, for, its, subtlety, verbal, precision, and, variety, of, effects, according, to, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, a, greek, historian, and, teacher, of, rhetoric, demosthenes, represented, the, final, stage, in, the, development, of, attic, prose, both, dionysius, and, cicero, assert, that, demosthenes, brought, together, the, best, features, of, the, basic, types, of, style, he, used, the, middle, or, normal, type, style, ordinarily, and, applied, the, archaic, type, and, the, type, of, plain, elegance, where, they, were, fitting, in, each, one, of, the, three, types, he, was, better, than, its, special, masters, he, is, therefore, regarded, as, a, consummate, orator, adept, in, the, techniques, of, oratory, which, are, brought, together, in, his, work, according, to, the, classical, scholar, harry, thurston, peck, demosthenes, affects, no, learning, he, aims, at, no, elegance, he, seeks, no, glaring, ornaments, he, rarely, touches, the, heart, with, a, soft, or, melting, appeal, and, when, he, does, it, is, only, with, an, effect, in, which, a, third, rate, speaker, would, have, surpassed, him, he, had, no, wit, no, humour, no, vivacity, in, our, acceptance, of, these, terms, the, secret, of, his, power, is, simple, for, it, lies, essentially, in, the, fact, that, his, political, principles, were, interwoven, with, his, very, spirit, in, this, judgement, peck, agrees, with, jaeger, who, said, that, the, imminent, political, decision, imbued, demosthenes, speech, with, a, fascinating, artistic, power, from, his, part, george, a, kennedy, believes, that, his, political, speeches, in, the, ekklesia, were, to, become, the, artistic, exposition, of, reasoned, views, demosthenes, was, apt, at, combining, abruptness, with, the, extended, period, brevity, with, breadth, hence, his, style, harmonises, with, his, fervent, commitment, his, language, is, simple, and, natural, never, far, fetched, or, artificial, according, to, jebb, demosthenes, was, a, true, artist, who, could, make, his, art, obey, him, for, his, part, aeschines, stigmatised, his, intensity, attributing, to, his, rival, strings, of, absurd, and, incoherent, images, dionysius, stated, that, demosthenes, only, shortcoming, is, the, lack, of, humour, although, quintilian, regards, this, deficiency, as, a, virtue, in, a, now, lost, letter, cicero, though, an, admirer, of, the, athenian, orator, claimed, that, occasionally, demosthenes, nods, and, elsewhere, cicero, also, argued, that, although, he, is, pre, eminent, demosthenes, sometimes, fails, to, satisfy, his, ears, the, main, criticism, of, demosthenes, art, however, seems, to, have, rested, chiefly, on, his, known, reluctance, to, speak, ex, tempore, he, often, declined, to, comment, on, subjects, he, had, not, studied, beforehand, however, he, gave, the, most, elaborate, preparation, to, all, his, speeches, and, therefore, his, arguments, were, the, products, of, careful, study, he, was, also, famous, for, his, caustic, wit, besides, his, style, cicero, also, admired, other, aspects, of, demosthenes, works, such, as, the, good, prose, rhythm, and, the, way, he, structured, and, arranged, the, material, in, his, orations, according, to, the, roman, statesman, demosthenes, regarded, delivery, gestures, voice, etc, as, more, important, than, style, although, he, lacked, aeschines, charming, voice, and, demades, skill, at, improvisation, he, made, efficient, use, of, his, body, to, accentuate, his, words, thus, he, managed, to, project, his, ideas, and, arguments, much, more, forcefully, however, the, use, of, physical, gestures, was, not, an, integral, or, developed, part, of, rhetorical, training, in, his, day, moreover, his, delivery, was, not, accepted, by, everybody, in, antiquity, demetrius, phalereus, and, the, comedians, ridiculed, demosthenes, theatricality, whilst, aeschines, regarded, leodamas, of, acharnae, as, superior, to, him, demosthenes, relied, heavily, on, the, different, aspects, of, ethos, especially, phronesis, when, presenting, himself, to, the, assembly, he, had, to, depict, himself, as, a, credible, and, wise, statesman, and, adviser, to, be, persuasive, one, tactic, that, demosthenes, used, during, his, philippics, was, foresight, he, pleaded, with, his, audience, to, predict, the, potential, of, being, defeated, and, to, prepare, he, appealed, to, pathos, through, patriotism, and, introducing, the, atrocities, that, would, befall, athens, if, it, was, taken, over, by, philip, he, was, a, master, at, self, fashioning, by, referring, to, his, previous, accomplishments, and, renewing, his, credibility, he, would, also, slyly, undermine, his, audience, by, claiming, that, they, had, been, wrong, not, to, listen, before, but, they, could, redeem, themselves, if, they, listened, and, acted, with, him, presently, demosthenes, tailored, his, style, to, be, very, audience, specific, he, took, pride, in, not, relying, on, attractive, words, but, rather, simple, effective, prose, he, was, mindful, of, his, arrangement, he, used, clauses, to, create, patterns, that, would, make, seemingly, complex, sentences, easy, for, the, hearer, to, follow, his, tendency, to, focus, on, delivery, promoted, him, to, use, repetition, this, would, ingrain, the, importance, into, the, audience, s, minds, he, also, relied, on, speed, and, delay, to, create, suspense, and, interest, among, the, audience, when, presenting, the, most, important, aspects, of, his, speech, one, of, his, most, effective, skills, was, his, ability, to, strike, a, balance, his, works, were, complex, so, that, the, audience, would, not, be, offended, by, any, elementary, language, but, the, most, important, parts, were, clear, and, easily, understood, demosthenes, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, greatest, orators, of, all, time, and, his, fame, has, continued, down, the, ages, authors, and, scholars, who, flourished, at, rome, such, as, longinus, and, caecilius, regarded, his, oratory, as, sublime, juvenal, acclaimed, him, as, largus, et, exundans, ingenii, fons, a, large, and, overflowing, fountain, of, genius, and, he, inspired, cicero, s, speeches, against, mark, antony, also, called, the, philippics, according, to, professor, of, classics, cecil, wooten, cicero, ended, his, career, by, trying, to, imitate, demosthenes, political, role, plutarch, drew, attention, in, his, life, of, demosthenes, to, the, strong, similarities, between, the, personalities, and, careers, of, demosthenes, and, marcus, tullius, cicero, the, divine, power, seems, originally, to, have, designed, demosthenes, and, cicero, upon, the, same, plan, giving, them, many, similarities, in, their, natural, characters, as, their, passion, for, distinction, and, their, love, of, liberty, in, civil, life, and, their, want, of, courage, in, dangers, and, war, and, at, the, same, time, also, to, have, added, many, accidental, resemblances, i, think, there, can, hardly, be, found, two, other, orators, who, from, small, and, obscure, beginnings, became, so, great, and, mighty, who, both, contested, with, kings, and, tyrants, both, lost, their, daughters, were, driven, out, of, their, country, and, returned, with, honour, who, flying, from, thence, again, were, both, seized, upon, by, their, enemies, and, at, last, ended, their, lives, with, the, liberty, of, their, countrymen, during, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, demosthenes, had, a, reputation, for, eloquence, he, was, read, more, than, any, other, ancient, orator, only, cicero, offered, any, real, competition, french, author, and, lawyer, guillaume, du, vair, praised, his, speeches, for, their, artful, arrangement, and, elegant, style, john, jewel, bishop, of, salisbury, and, jacques, amyot, a, french, renaissance, writer, and, translator, regarded, demosthenes, as, a, great, or, even, the, supreme, orator, for, thomas, wilson, who, first, published, translation, of, his, speeches, into, english, demosthenes, was, not, only, an, eloquent, orator, but, mainly, an, authoritative, statesman, a, source, of, wisdom, in, modern, history, orators, such, as, henry, clay, would, mimic, demosthenes, technique, his, ideas, and, principles, survived, influencing, prominent, politicians, and, movements, of, our, times, hence, he, constituted, a, source, of, inspiration, for, the, authors, of, the, federalist, papers, a, series, of, 85, essays, arguing, for, the, ratification, of, the, united, states, constitution, and, for, the, major, orators, of, the, french, revolution, french, prime, minister, georges, clemenceau, was, among, those, who, idealised, demosthenes, and, wrote, a, book, about, him, for, his, part, friedrich, nietzsche, often, composed, his, sentences, according, to, the, paradigms, of, demosthenes, whose, style, he, admired, the, publication, and, distribution, of, prose, texts, was, common, practice, in, athens, by, the, latter, half, of, the, fourth, century, bc, and, demosthenes, was, among, the, athenian, politicians, who, set, the, trend, publishing, many, or, even, all, of, his, orations, after, his, death, texts, of, his, speeches, survived, in, athens, possibly, forming, part, of, the, library, of, cicero, s, friend, atticus, though, their, fate, is, otherwise, unknown, and, in, the, library, of, alexandria, the, alexandrian, texts, were, incorporated, into, the, body, of, classical, greek, literature, that, was, preserved, catalogued, and, studied, by, the, scholars, of, the, hellenistic, period, from, then, until, the, fourth, century, ad, copies, of, demosthenes, orations, multiplied, and, they, were, in, a, relatively, good, position, to, survive, the, tense, period, from, the, sixth, until, the, ninth, century, ad, in, the, end, sixty, one, orations, attributed, to, demosthenes, survived, till, the, present, day, some, however, are, pseudonymous, friedrich, blass, a, german, classical, scholar, believes, that, nine, more, speeches, were, recorded, by, the, orator, but, they, are, not, extant, modern, editions, of, these, speeches, are, based, on, four, manuscripts, of, the, tenth, and, eleventh, centuries, ad, some, of, the, speeches, that, comprise, the, demosthenic, corpus, are, known, to, have, been, written, by, other, authors, though, scholars, differ, over, which, speeches, these, are, irrespective, of, their, status, the, speeches, attributed, to, demosthenes, are, often, grouped, in, three, genres, first, defined, by, aristotle, in, addition, to, the, speeches, there, are, fifty, six, prologues, openings, of, speeches, they, were, collected, for, the, library, of, alexandria, by, callimachus, who, believed, them, genuine, modern, scholars, are, divided, some, reject, them, while, others, such, as, blass, believe, they, are, authentic, finally, six, letters, also, survive, under, demosthenes, name, and, their, authorship, too, is, hotly, debated, the, demosthenian, literary, society, founded, in, 1803, at, the, university, of, georgia, was, named, in, honor, of, demosthenes, in, 1936, an, american, botanist, albert, charles, smith, named, a, genus, of, shrubs, in, the, family, ericaceae, which, were, native, to, south, america, as, demosthenesia, in, honour, of, demosthenes, a, according, to, edward, cohen, professor, of, classics, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, cleoboule, was, the, daughter, of, a, scythian, woman, and, of, an, athenian, father, gylon, although, other, scholars, insist, on, the, genealogical, purity, of, demosthenes, there, is, an, agreement, among, scholars, that, cleoboule, was, a, crimean, and, not, an, athenian, citizen, gylon, had, suffered, banishment, at, the, end, of, the, peloponnesian, war, for, allegedly, betraying, nymphaeum, in, crimaea, according, to, aeschines, gylon, received, as, a, gift, from, the, bosporan, rulers, a, place, called, the, gardens, in, the, colony, of, kepoi, in, present, day, russia, located, within, two, miles, 3, km, of, phanagoria, nevertheless, the, accuracy, of, these, allegations, is, disputed, since, more, than, seventy, years, had, elapsed, between, gylon, s, possible, treachery, and, aeschines, speech, and, therefore, the, orator, could, be, confident, that, his, audience, would, have, no, direct, knowledge, of, events, at, nymphaeum, b, according, to, tsatsos, the, trials, against, the, guardians, lasted, until, demosthenes, was, twenty, four, nietzsche, reduces, the, time, of, the, judicial, disputes, to, five, years, c, according, to, the, tenth, century, encyclopedia, suda, demosthenes, studied, with, eubulides, and, plato, cicero, and, quintilian, argue, that, demosthenes, was, plato, s, disciple, tsatsos, and, the, philologist, henri, weil, believe, that, there, is, no, indication, that, demosthenes, was, a, pupil, of, plato, or, isocrates, as, far, as, isaeus, is, concerned, according, to, jebb, the, school, of, isaeus, is, nowhere, else, mentioned, nor, is, the, name, of, any, other, pupil, recorded, peck, believes, that, demosthenes, continued, to, study, under, isaeus, for, the, space, of, four, years, after, he, had, reached, his, majority, d, batalus, or, batalos, meant, stammerer, in, ancient, greek, but, it, was, also, the, name, of, a, flute, player, in, ridicule, of, whom, antiphanes, wrote, a, play, and, of, a, songwriter, the, word, batalus, was, also, used, by, the, athenians, to, describe, the, anus, in, fact, the, word, actually, defining, his, speech, defect, was, battalos, signifying, someone, with, rhotacism, but, it, was, crudely, misrepresented, as, batalos, by, the, enemies, of, demosthenes, and, by, plutarch, s, time, the, original, word, had, already, lost, currency, another, nickname, of, demosthenes, was, argas, according, to, plutarch, this, name, was, given, him, either, for, his, savage, and, spiteful, behaviour, or, for, his, disagreeable, way, of, speaking, argas, was, a, poetical, word, for, a, snake, but, also, the, name, of, a, poet, e, both, tsatsos, and, weil, maintain, that, demosthenes, never, abandoned, the, profession, of, the, logographer, but, after, delivering, his, first, political, orations, he, wanted, to, be, regarded, as, a, statesman, according, to, james, j, murphy, professor, emeritus, of, rhetoric, and, communication, at, the, university, of, california, davis, his, lifelong, career, as, a, logographer, continued, even, during, his, most, intense, involvement, in, the, political, struggle, against, philip, f, theorika, were, allowances, paid, by, the, state, to, poor, athenians, to, enable, them, to, watch, dramatic, festivals, according, to, libanius, eubulus, passed, a, law, making, it, difficult, to, divert, public, funds, including, theorika, for, minor, military, operations, e, m, burke, argues, that, if, this, was, indeed, a, law, of, eubulus, it, would, have, served, as, a, means, to, check, a, too, aggressive, and, expensive, interventionism, allowing, for, the, controlled, expenditures, on, other, items, including, construction, for, defense, thus, burke, believes, that, in, the, eubulan, period, the, theoric, fund, was, used, not, only, as, allowances, for, public, entertainment, but, also, for, a, variety, of, projects, including, public, works, as, burke, also, points, out, in, his, later, and, more, mature, political, career, demosthenes, no, longer, criticised, theorika, in, fact, in, his, fourth, philippic, 341, 340, bc, he, defended, theoric, spending, g, in, the, third, olynthiac, and, in, the, third, philippic, demosthenes, characterised, philip, as, a, barbarian, one, of, the, various, abusive, terms, applied, by, the, orator, to, the, king, of, macedon, according, to, konstantinos, tsatsos, and, douglas, m, macdowell, demosthenes, regarded, as, greeks, only, those, who, had, reached, the, cultural, standards, of, south, greece, and, he, did, not, take, into, consideration, ethnological, criteria, his, contempt, for, philip, is, forcefully, expressed, in, the, third, philippic, 31, in, these, terms, he, is, not, only, no, greek, nor, related, to, the, greeks, but, not, even, a, barbarian, from, any, place, that, can, be, named, with, honour, but, a, pestilent, knave, from, macedonia, whence, it, was, never, yet, possible, to, buy, a, decent, slave, the, wording, is, even, more, telling, in, greek, ending, with, an, accumulation, of, plosive, pi, sounds, nevertheless, philip, in, his, letter, to, the, council, and, people, of, athens, mentioned, by, demosthenes, places, himself, with, the, rest, of, the, greeks, h, aeschines, maintained, that, demosthenes, was, bribed, to, drop, his, charges, against, meidias, in, return, for, a, payment, of, thirty, mnai, plutarch, argued, that, demosthenes, accepted, the, bribe, out, of, fear, of, meidias, s, power, philipp, august, b, ckh, also, accepted, aeschines, s, account, for, an, out, of, court, settlement, and, concluded, that, the, speech, was, never, delivered, b, ckh, s, position, was, soon, endorsed, by, arnold, schaefer, and, blass, weil, agreed, that, demosthenes, never, delivered, against, meidias, but, believed, that, he, dropped, the, charges, for, political, reasons, in, 1956, hartmut, erbse, partly, challenged, b, ckh, s, conclusions, when, he, argued, that, against, meidias, was, a, finished, speech, that, could, have, been, delivered, in, court, but, erbse, then, sided, with, george, grote, by, accepting, that, after, demosthenes, secured, a, judgment, in, his, favour, he, reached, some, kind, of, settlement, with, meidias, kenneth, dover, also, endorsed, aeschines, s, account, and, argued, that, although, the, speech, was, never, delivered, in, court, demosthenes, put, into, circulation, an, attack, on, meidias, dover, s, arguments, were, refuted, by, edward, m, harris, who, concluded, that, although, we, cannot, be, sure, about, the, outcome, of, the, trial, the, speech, was, delivered, in, court, and, that, aeschines, story, was, a, lie, i, according, to, plutarch, demosthenes, deserted, his, colours, and, did, nothing, honorable, nor, was, his, performance, answerable, to, his, speeches, j, aeschines, reproached, demosthenes, for, being, silent, as, to, the, seventy, talents, of, the, king, s, gold, which, he, allegedly, seized, and, embezzled, aeschines, and, dinarchus, also, maintained, that, when, the, arcadians, offered, their, services, for, ten, talents, demosthenes, refused, to, furnish, the, money, to, the, thebans, who, were, conducting, the, negotiations, and, so, the, arcadians, sold, out, to, the, macedonians, k, the, exact, chronology, of, harpalus, s, entrance, into, athens, and, of, all, the, related, events, remains, a, debated, topic, among, modern, scholars, who, have, proposed, different, and, sometimes, conflicting, chronological, schemes, l, according, to, pausanias, demosthenes, himself, and, others, had, declared, that, the, orator, had, taken, no, part, of, the, money, that, harpalus, brought, from, asia, he, also, narrates, the, following, story, shortly, after, harpalus, ran, away, from, athens, he, was, put, to, death, by, the, servants, who, were, attending, him, though, some, assert, that, he, was, assassinated, the, steward, of, his, money, fled, to, rhodes, and, was, arrested, by, a, macedonian, officer, philoxenus, philoxenus, proceeded, to, examine, the, slave, until, he, learned, everything, about, such, as, had, allowed, themselves, to, accept, a, bribe, from, harpalus, he, then, sent, a, dispatch, to, athens, in, which, he, gave, a, list, of, the, persons, who, had, taken, a, bribe, from, harpalus, demosthenes, however, he, never, mentioned, at, all, although, alexander, held, him, in, bitter, hatred, and, he, himself, had, a, private, quarrel, with, him, on, the, other, hand, plutarch, believes, that, harpalus, sent, demosthenes, a, cup, with, twenty, talents, and, that, demosthenes, could, not, resist, the, temptation, but, admitting, the, present, he, surrendered, himself, up, to, the, interest, of, harpalus, tsatsos, defends, demosthenes, s, innocence, but, irkos, apostolidis, underlines, the, problematic, character, of, the, primary, sources, on, this, issue, hypereides, and, dinarchus, were, at, the, time, demosthenes, s, political, opponents, and, accusers, and, states, that, despite, the, rich, bibliography, on, harpalus, s, case, modern, scholarship, has, not, yet, managed, to, reach, a, safe, conclusion, on, whether, demosthenes, was, bribed, or, not, m, blass, disputes, the, authorship, of, the, following, speeches, fourth, philippic, funeral, oration, erotic, essay, against, stephanus, 2, and, against, evergus, and, mnesibulus, while, schaefer, recognises, as, genuine, only, twenty, nine, orations, of, demosthenes, s, corpus, political, speeches, j, h, vince, singles, out, five, as, spurious, on, halonnesus, fourth, philippic, answer, to, philip, s, letter, on, organization, and, on, the, treaty, with, alexander, n, in, this, discussion, the, work, of, jonathan, a, goldstein, professor, of,
