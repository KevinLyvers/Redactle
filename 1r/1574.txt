family, was, well, to, do, he, was, born, in, fuyuan, springs, also, called, fuyuanshui, village, hua, county, now, part, of, huadu, district, in, canton, guangzhou, guangdong, to, hong, jingyang, a, farmer, and, elected, headman, and, madam, wang, he, and, his, family, moved, to, guanlubu, village, shortly, after, his, birth, upon, marrying, his, wife, lai, xiying, hong, received, the, courtesy, name, renkun, his, sister, hong, xuanjiao, became, the, commander, of, the, female, battalion, during, the, taiping, rebellion, hong, showed, an, interest, in, scholarship, at, an, early, age, so, his, family, made, financial, sacrifices, to, provide, a, formal, education, for, him, in, the, hope, that, he, could, one, day, complete, all, of, the, civil, service, examinations, hong, began, studying, at, a, primary, school, in, his, village, at, the, age, of, five, he, was, able, to, recite, the, four, books, after, five, or, six, years, he, then, took, the, local, xiucai, preliminary, civil, service, examinations, and, placed, first, a, few, years, later, he, traveled, to, the, nearby, city, of, guangzhou, to, take, the, imperial, examinations, he, was, unsuccessful, and, his, parents, being, unable, to, afford, to, continue, his, education, he, was, forced, to, return, to, agricultural, work, the, next, year, he, accompanied, a, wealthy, schoolmate, elsewhere, for, a, year, of, study, and, became, a, village, schoolteacher, upon, his, return, in, 1836, at, the, age, of, 22, hong, returned, to, guangzhou, to, retake, the, imperial, examinations, while, in, guangzhou, hong, heard, edwin, stevens, a, foreign, missionary, and, his, interpreter, preaching, about, christianity, from, them, hong, received, a, set, of, pamphlets, entitled, good, words, for, exhorting, the, age, which, were, written, by, liang, fa, stevens, s, assistant, and, contained, excerpts, from, the, bible, along, with, homilies, and, other, material, prepared, by, liang, supposedly, hong, only, briefly, looked, over, these, pamphlets, and, did, not, pay, much, attention, to, them, at, the, time, unsurprisingly, he, again, failed, the, imperial, examinations, which, had, a, pass, rate, of, less, than, one, percent, in, 1837, hong, attempted, and, failed, the, imperial, examinations, for, a, third, time, leading, to, a, nervous, breakdown, he, was, delirious, for, days, to, the, point, that, his, family, feared, for, his, life, while, convalescing, hong, dreamed, of, visiting, heaven, where, he, discovered, that, he, possessed, a, celestial, family, distinct, from, his, earthly, family, which, included, a, heavenly, father, mother, elder, brother, sister, in, law, wife, and, son, his, heavenly, father, wearing, a, black, dragon, robe, and, high, brimmed, hat, with, a, long, golden, beard, lamented, that, men, were, worshiping, demons, rather, than, he, himself, and, presented, hong, with, a, sword, and, golden, seal, with, which, to, slay, the, demons, infesting, heaven, furthermore, he, did, so, with, the, help, of, his, celestial, older, brother, and, a, heavenly, army, the, father, figure, later, informed, hong, that, his, given, name, violated, taboos, and, had, to, be, changed, suggesting, as, one, option, the, hong, xiuquan, moniker, ultimately, adopted, by, hong, in, later, embellishments, hong, would, declare, that, he, also, saw, confucius, being, punished, by, hong, s, celestial, father, for, leading, the, people, astray, his, acquaintances, would, later, claim, that, after, awakening, from, his, dreams, hong, became, more, careful, friendly, and, open, while, his, pace, became, imposing, and, firm, and, his, height, and, size, increased, hong, stopped, studying, for, the, imperial, examinations, and, sought, work, as, a, teacher, for, the, next, several, years, hong, taught, at, several, schools, around, the, area, of, his, hometown, in, 1843, hong, failed, the, imperial, examinations, for, the, fourth, and, final, time, it, was, only, then, prompted, by, a, visit, by, his, cousin, that, hong, took, time, to, carefully, examine, the, christian, pamphlets, he, had, received, after, reading, these, pamphlets, hong, came, to, believe, that, they, had, given, him, the, key, to, interpreting, his, visions, his, celestial, father, was, god, the, father, whom, he, identified, with, shangdi, from, chinese, tradition, the, elder, brother, that, he, had, seen, was, jesus, christ, and, he, had, been, directed, to, rid, the, world, of, demon, worship, this, interpretation, led, him, to, conclude, that, he, was, the, literal, son, of, god, and, younger, brother, to, jesus, in, contrast, to, some, of, the, later, leaders, of, his, movement, hong, appears, to, have, genuinely, believed, in, his, ascent, to, heaven, and, divine, mission, after, coming, to, this, conclusion, hong, began, destroying, idols, and, enthusiastically, preaching, his, interpretation, of, christianity, as, a, symbolic, gesture, to, purge, china, of, confucianism, he, and, the, cousin, asked, for, two, giant, swords, three, chi, 1, meter, 3, 3, ft, long, and, nine, jin, about, 4, 5, kg, called, the, demon, slaying, swords, to, be, forged, hong, began, by, burning, all, confucian, and, buddhist, statues, and, books, in, his, house, and, began, preaching, to, his, community, about, his, visions, some, of, his, earliest, converts, were, relatives, of, his, who, had, also, failed, their, examinations, and, belonged, to, the, hakka, minority, feng, yunshan, and, hong, rengan, he, collaborated, with, them, to, destroy, holy, statues, in, small, villages, to, the, ire, of, local, citizens, and, officials, hong, and, his, converts, acts, were, considered, sacrilegious, and, they, were, persecuted, by, confucians, who, forced, them, to, leave, their, positions, as, village, tutors, in, april, 1844, hong, feng, yunshan, and, two, other, relatives, of, hong, left, hua, county, to, travel, and, preach, they, first, journeyed, to, guangzhou, and, preached, in, the, outlying, areas, before, heading, northwest, to, white, tiger, village, there, hong, and, feng, yunshan, parted, ways, before, traveling, some, 400, kilometers, 250, mi, to, the, southwest, to, the, village, of, sigu, guiping, county, guangxi, where, distant, relatives, of, hong, s, resided, including, two, early, converts, who, had, returned, home, it, is, in, or, near, sigu, that, hong, begins, to, draft, exhortations, to, worship, the, one, true, god, his, first, substantial, work, in, november, 1844, after, having, preached, in, guangxi, for, five, months, hong, returned, home, without, feng, and, resumed, his, previous, job, as, a, village, teacher, while, continuing, to, write, religious, tracts, in, 1847, hong, xiuquan, was, invited, by, a, member, of, the, chinese, union, to, study, with, the, american, southern, baptist, missionary, reverend, issachar, jacox, roberts, hong, accepted, the, invitation, and, traveled, to, guangzhou, with, his, cousin, hong, rengan, once, there, hong, studied, karl, g, tzlaff, s, translations, of, the, old, and, new, testaments, converted, to, protestantism, and, requested, to, be, baptized, by, roberts, roberts, refused, to, do, so, possibly, due, to, hong, being, tricked, by, the, other, converts, into, requesting, monetary, aid, from, roberts, hong, left, guangzhou, on, 12, july, 1847, to, search, for, feng, yunshan, although, robbed, of, all, of, his, possessions, including, his, demon, slaying, sword, by, bandits, in, the, town, of, meizixun, he, eventually, reached, thistle, mountain, on, 27, august, 1847, there, he, reunited, with, feng, and, discovered, the, society, of, god, worshippers, that, feng, had, founded, in, january, 1848, feng, yunshan, was, arrested, and, banished, to, guangdong, and, hong, xiuquan, left, for, guangdong, shortly, thereafter, to, once, again, reunite, with, feng, in, feng, and, hong, s, absence, yang, xiuqing, and, xiao, chaogui, jointly, emerged, to, lead, the, god, worshipers, themselves, both, claimed, to, enter, trances, which, allowed, them, to, speak, as, a, member, of, the, trinity, god, the, father, in, the, case, of, yang, and, jesus, christ, in, the, case, of, xiao, when, hong, and, feng, returned, in, the, summer, of, 1849, they, investigated, yang, and, xiao, s, claims, and, declared, them, to, be, genuine, hong, ministered, to, the, faithful, in, outdoor, meetings, strongly, resembling, the, baptist, tent, revivals, he, had, witnessed, with, issachar, roberts, most, of, hong, xiuquan, s, knowledge, of, the, scriptures, came, from, the, books, known, as, good, words, to, admonish, the, age, written, by, the, chinese, preacher, liang, fa, as, well, as, a, localized, bible, translated, into, chinese, many, western, missionaries, grew, jealous, of, hong, and, his, local, ministry, these, competing, missionaries, were, fond, of, spreading, defamatory, rumors, such, as, his, lack, of, baptism, hong, and, his, cousin, were, in, fact, both, baptized, according, to, the, way, prescribed, in, the, pamphlet, good, words, to, admonish, the, age, in, 1847, hong, began, his, translation, and, adaptation, of, the, bible, what, came, to, be, known, as, authorized, taiping, version, of, the, bible, or, the, taiping, bible, which, he, based, on, gutzlaff, s, translation, he, presented, his, followers, with, the, bible, as, a, vision, of, the, authentic, religion, that, had, existed, in, ancient, china, before, it, was, wiped, out, by, confucius, and, the, imperial, system, the, deity, of, the, old, testament, punished, evil, nations, and, rewarded, those, who, followed, his, commandments, even, music, food, and, marriage, laws, hong, made, some, minor, changes, in, the, text, such, as, correcting, misprints, and, improving, the, prose, style, but, adapted, the, meaning, elsewhere, to, fit, his, own, theology, and, moral, teachings, for, instance, in, genesis, 27, 25, the, israelites, did, not, drink, wine, and, in, genesis, 38, 16, 26, he, omitted, the, sexual, relations, between, the, father, and, his, son, s, widow, hong, preached, a, mixture, of, communal, utopianism, evangelism, and, oriental, syncretism, while, proclaiming, sexual, equality, the, sect, segregated, men, from, women, and, encouraged, all, its, followers, to, pay, their, assets, into, a, communal, treasury, when, hong, returned, to, guangxi, he, found, that, feng, yunshan, had, accumulated, a, following, of, around, 2, 000, converts, guangxi, was, a, dangerous, area, at, this, time, with, many, bandit, groups, based, in, the, mountains, and, pirates, on, the, rivers, perhaps, due, to, these, more, pressing, concerns, the, authorities, were, largely, tolerant, of, hong, and, his, followers, however, the, instability, of, the, region, meant, that, hong, s, followers, were, inevitably, drawn, into, conflict, with, other, groups, not, least, because, of, their, predominantly, hakka, ethnicity, there, are, records, of, numerous, incidents, when, local, villages, and, clans, as, well, as, groups, of, pirates, and, bandits, came, into, conflict, with, the, authorities, and, responded, by, fleeing, to, join, hong, s, movement, the, rising, tension, between, the, sect, and, the, authorities, was, probably, the, most, important, factor, in, hong, s, eventual, decision, to, rebel, by, 1850, hong, had, between, 10, 000, and, 30, 000, followers, the, authorities, were, alarmed, at, the, growing, size, of, the, sect, and, ordered, them, to, disperse, a, local, force, was, sent, to, attack, them, when, they, refused, but, the, imperial, troops, were, routed, and, a, deputy, magistrate, killed, a, full, scale, attack, was, launched, by, government, forces, in, the, first, month, of, 1851, in, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, jintian, uprising, named, after, the, town, of, jintian, which, became, guiping, guangxi, where, the, sect, was, based, hong, s, followers, emerged, victorious, and, beheaded, the, manchu, commander, of, the, government, army, hong, declared, the, founding, of, the, heavenly, kingdom, of, transcendent, peace, on, 11, january, 1851, despite, this, evidence, of, planning, hong, and, his, followers, faced, immediate, challenges, the, local, green, standard, army, outnumbered, them, ten, to, one, and, had, recruited, the, help, of, the, river, pirates, to, keep, the, rebellion, contained, to, jintian, after, a, month, of, preparation, the, rebels, managed, to, break, through, the, blockade, and, fight, their, way, to, the, town, of, yongan, distinct, from, places, named, yong, an, which, fell, to, them, on, 25, september, 1851, hong, and, his, troops, remained, in, yongan, for, three, months, sustained, by, local, landowners, who, were, hostile, to, the, manchu, ruled, qing, dynasty, the, imperial, army, regrouped, and, launched, another, attack, on, the, rebels, in, yongan, having, run, out, of, gunpowder, hong, s, followers, fought, their, way, out, by, sword, and, made, for, the, city, of, guilin, to, which, they, laid, siege, however, the, fortifications, of, guilin, proved, too, strong, and, hong, and, his, followers, eventually, gave, up, and, set, out, northwards, towards, hunan, here, they, encountered, an, elite, militia, created, by, a, local, member, of, the, gentry, specifically, to, put, down, peasant, rebellions, the, two, forces, fought, at, soyi, ford, on, 10, june, 1852, the, rebels, were, forced, into, retreat, and, 20, of, their, troops, were, killed, however, in, march, 1853, hong, s, forces, managed, to, take, nanjing, and, turned, it, into, the, capital, of, their, movement, after, establishing, his, capital, at, nanjing, hong, implemented, an, ambitious, reform, and, modernization, program, he, created, an, elaborate, civil, bureaucracy, reformed, the, calendar, used, in, his, kingdom, outlawed, opium, use, and, introduced, a, number, of,

and, religious, rules, most, trade, was, suppressed, and, some, communal, land, ownership, was, introduced, polygamy, was, forbidden, and, men, and, women, were, separated, although, hong, and, other,

yang, and, his, family, murdered, in, a, purge, that, subsequently, spun, out, of, control, resulting, in, the, further, purge, of, its, main, perpetrator, wei, changhui, following, a, failed,
