political, and, recreational, as, a, result, his, writings, are, commonly, discussed, in, books, and, journals, and, he, has, often, been, quoted, by, nature, photographers, such, as, ansel, adams, muir, has, profoundly, shaped, the, very, categories, through, which, americans, understand, and, envision, their, relationships, with, the, natural, world, writes, holmes, muir, was, noted, for, being, an, ecological, thinker, political, spokesman, and, environmental, advocate, whose, writings, became, a, personal, guide, into, nature, for, many, people, making, his, name, almost, ubiquitous, in, the, modern, environmental, consciousness, according, to, author, william, anderson, muir, exemplified, the, archetype, of, our, oneness, with, the, earth, while, biographer, donald, worster, says, he, believed, his, mission, was, saving, the, american, soul, from, total, surrender, to, materialism, 403, on, april, 21, 2013, the, first, john, muir, day, was, celebrated, in, scotland, which, marked, the, 175th, anniversary, of, his, birth, paying, homage, to, the, conservationist, john, muir, was, born, in, dunbar, scotland, in, a, three, story, stone, building, now, preserved, as, a, museum, he, was, the, third, of, eight, children, of, daniel, muir, and, ann, gilrye, their, other, children, were, margaret, sarah, david, daniel, ann, and, mary, twins, and, the, american, born, joanna, his, earliest, recollections, were, of, taking, short, walks, with, his, grandfather, when, he, was, three, in, his, autobiography, he, described, his, boyhood, pursuits, which, included, fighting, either, by, re, enacting, romantic, battles, from, the, wars, of, scottish, independence, or, just, wrestling, on, the, playground, and, hunting, for, birds, nests, ostensibly, to, one, up, his, fellows, as, they, compared, notes, on, who, knew, where, the, most, were, located, 25, 37, author, amy, marquis, notes, that, he, began, his, love, affair, with, nature, while, young, and, implies, that, it, may, have, been, in, reaction, to, his, strict, religious, upbringing, his, father, believed, that, anything, that, distracted, from, bible, studies, was, frivolous, and, punishable, but, the, young, muir, was, a, restless, spirit, and, especially, prone, to, lashings, as, a, young, boy, muir, became, fascinated, with, the, east, lothian, landscape, and, spent, a, lot, of, time, wandering, the, local, coastline, and, countryside, it, was, during, this, time, that, he, became, interested, in, natural, history, and, the, works, of, scottish, naturalist, alexander, wilson, although, he, spent, the, majority, of, his, life, in, america, muir, never, forgot, his, roots, in, scotland, he, held, a, strong, connection, with, his, birthplace, and, scottish, identity, throughout, his, life, and, was, frequently, heard, talking, about, his, childhood, spent, amid, the, east, lothian, countryside, he, greatly, admired, the, works, of, thomas, carlyle, and, poetry, of, robert, burns, he, was, known, to, carry, a, collection, of, poems, by, burns, during, his, travels, through, the, american, wilderness, he, returned, to, scotland, on, a, trip, in, 1893, where, he, met, one, of, his, dunbar, schoolmates, and, visited, the, places, of, his, youth, that, were, etched, in, his, memory, he, never, lost, his, scottish, accent, since, he, was, already, 11, years, old, when, he, and, his, family, emigrated, to, america, in, 1849, muir, s, family, immigrated, to, the, united, states, starting, a, farm, near, portage, wisconsin, called, fountain, lake, farm, it, has, been, designated, a, national, historic, landmark, stephen, fox, recounts, that, muir, s, father, found, the, church, of, scotland, insufficiently, strict, in, faith, and, practice, leading, to, their, immigration, and, joining, a, congregation, of, the, campbellite, restoration, movement, called, the, disciples, of, christ, 7, by, the, age, of, 11, the, young, muir, had, learned, to, recite, by, heart, and, by, sore, flesh, all, of, the, new, testament, and, most, of, the, old, testament, 30, in, maturity, while, remaining, a, deeply, spiritual, man, muir, may, have, changed, his, orthodox, beliefs, he, wrote, i, never, tried, to, abandon, creeds, or, code, of, civilization, they, went, away, of, their, own, accord, without, leaving, any, consciousness, of, loss, elsewhere, in, his, writings, he, described, the, conventional, image, of, a, creator, as, purely, a, manufactured, article, as, any, puppet, of, a, half, penny, theater, 95, 115, when, he, was, 22, years, old, muir, enrolled, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, paying, his, own, way, for, several, years, there, under, a, towering, black, locust, tree, beside, north, hall, muir, took, his, first, botany, lesson, a, fellow, student, plucked, a, flower, from, the, tree, and, used, it, to, explain, how, the, grand, locust, is, a, member, of, the, pea, family, related, to, the, straggling, pea, plant, fifty, years, later, the, naturalist, muir, described, the, day, in, his, autobiography, this, fine, lesson, charmed, me, and, sent, me, flying, to, the, woods, and, meadows, in, wild, enthusiasm, 225, as, a, freshman, muir, studied, chemistry, with, professor, ezra, carr, and, his, wife, jeanne, they, became, lifelong, friends, and, muir, developed, a, lasting, interest, in, chemistry, and, the, sciences, 76, muir, took, an, eclectic, approach, to, his, studies, attending, classes, for, two, years, but, never, being, listed, higher, than, a, first, year, student, due, to, his, unusual, selection, of, courses, records, showed, his, class, status, as, irregular, gent, and, even, though, he, never, graduated, he, learned, enough, geology, and, botany, to, inform, his, later, wanderings, 36, in, 1863, his, brother, daniel, left, wisconsin, and, moved, to, southern, ontario, then, known, as, canada, west, in, the, united, canadas, to, avoid, the, draft, during, the, us, civil, war, muir, left, school, and, travelled, to, the, same, region, in, 1864, and, spent, the, spring, summer, and, fall, exploring, the, woods, and, swamps, and, collecting, plants, around, the, southern, reaches, of, lake, huron, s, georgian, bay, 85, 92, muir, hiked, along, the, niagara, escarpment, including, much, of, today, s, bruce, trail, with, his, money, running, low, and, winter, coming, he, reunited, with, his, brother, daniel, near, meaford, ontario, who, persuaded, him, to, work, with, him, at, the, sawmill, and, rake, factory, of, william, trout, and, charles, jay, muir, lived, with, the, trout, family, in, an, area, called, trout, hollow, south, of, meaford, on, the, bighead, river, while, there, he, continued, botanizing, exploring, the, escarpment, and, bogs, collecting, and, cataloging, plants, one, source, appears, to, indicate, he, worked, at, the, mill, factory, until, the, summer, of, 1865, 37, while, another, says, he, stayed, on, at, trout, hollow, until, after, a, fire, burned, it, down, in, february, 1866, in, march, 1866, muir, returned, to, the, united, states, settling, in, indianapolis, to, work, in, a, wagon, wheel, factory, he, proved, valuable, to, his, employers, because, of, his, inventiveness, in, improving, the, machines, and, processes, he, was, promoted, to, supervisor, being, paid, 25, per, week, 48, in, early, march, 1867, an, accident, changed, the, course, of, his, life, a, tool, he, was, using, slipped, and, struck, him, in, the, eye, the, file, slipped, and, cut, the, cornea, in, his, right, eye, and, then, his, left, eye, sympathetically, failed, he, was, confined, to, a, darkened, room, for, six, weeks, to, regain, his, sight, worried, about, whether, he, would, end, up, blind, when, he, regained, his, sight, he, saw, the, world, and, his, purpose, in, a, new, light, muir, later, wrote, this, affliction, has, driven, me, to, the, sweet, fields, god, has, to, nearly, kill, us, sometimes, to, teach, us, lessons, from, that, point, on, he, determined, to, be, true, to, and, follow, his, dream, of, exploration, and, study, of, plants, 97, in, september, 1867, muir, undertook, a, walk, of, about, 1, 000, miles, 1, 600, km, from, kentucky, to, florida, which, he, recounted, in, his, book, a, thousand, mile, walk, to, the, gulf, he, had, no, specific, route, chosen, except, to, go, by, the, wildest, leafiest, and, least, trodden, way, i, could, find, when, muir, arrived, at, cedar, key, he, began, working, for, richard, hodgson, at, hodgson, s, sawmill, however, three, days, after, accepting, the, job, at, hodgson, s, muir, almost, died, of, a, malarial, sickness, after, spending, three, months, in, an, oft, delirious, state, muir, s, condition, improved, to, such, that, he, was, able, to, move, about, the, hodgson, s, house, and, look, outside, due, to, their, unending, kindness, in, caring, for, his, life, muir, stated, that, he, doubtless, owe, my, life, to, the, hodgsons, one, evening, in, early, january, 1868, muir, climbed, onto, the, hodgson, house, roof, to, watch, the, sunset, he, saw, a, ship, the, island, belle, and, learned, it, would, soon, be, sailing, for, cuba, 150, 154, muir, boarded, the, ship, and, while, in, havana, he, spent, his, hours, studying, shells, and, flowers, and, visiting, the, botanical, garden, in, the, city, 56, afterwards, he, sailed, to, new, york, city, and, booked, passage, to, california, 40, 41, in, 1878, muir, served, as, a, guide, and, artist, for, the, united, states, coast, and, geodetic, survey, on, the, survey, of, the, 39th, parallel, across, the, great, basin, of, nevada, and, utah, finally, settling, in, san, francisco, muir, immediately, left, for, a, week, long, visit, to, yosemite, a, place, he, had, only, read, about, seeing, it, for, the, first, time, muir, notes, that, he, was, overwhelmed, by, the, landscape, scrambling, down, steep, cliff, faces, to, get, a, closer, look, at, the, waterfalls, whooping, and, howling, at, the, vistas, jumping, tirelessly, from, flower, to, flower, he, later, returned, to, yosemite, and, worked, as, a, shepherd, for, a, season, he, climbed, a, number, of, mountains, including, cathedral, peak, and, mount, dana, and, hiked, an, old, trail, down, bloody, canyon, to, mono, lake, muir, built, a, small, cabin, along, yosemite, creek, 207, designing, it, so, that, a, section, of, the, stream, flowed, through, a, corner, of, the, room, so, he, could, enjoy, the, sound, of, running, water, he, lived, in, the, cabin, for, two, years, 143, and, wrote, about, this, period, in, his, book, first, summer, in, the, sierra, 1911, muir, s, biographer, frederick, turner, notes, muir, s, journal, entry, upon, first, visiting, the, valley, and, writes, that, his, description, blazes, from, the, page, with, the, authentic, force, of, a, conversion, experience, 172, during, these, years, in, yosemite, muir, was, unmarried, often, unemployed, with, no, prospects, for, a, career, and, had, periods, of, anguish, writes, naturalist, author, john, tallmadge, he, did, marry, in, 1880, to, louisa, strentzel, he, went, into, business, for, 10, years, with, his, father, in, law, managing, the, orchards, on, the, family, 2600, acre, farm, in, martinez, california, john, and, louisa, had, two, daughters, wanda, muir, hanna, and, helen, muir, funk, he, was, sustained, by, the, natural, environment, and, by, reading, the, essays, of, naturalist, author, ralph, waldo, emerson, who, wrote, about, the, very, life, that, muir, was, then, living, on, excursions, into, the, back, country, of, yosemite, he, traveled, alone, carrying, only, a, tin, cup, a, handful, of, tea, a, loaf, of, bread, and, a, copy, of, emerson, 52, 53, he, usually, spent, his, evenings, sitting, by, a, campfire, in, his, overcoat, reading, emerson, under, the, stars, as, the, years, passed, he, became, a, fixture, in, the, valley, respected, for, his, knowledge, of, natural, history, his, skill, as, a, guide, and, his, vivid, storytelling, 53, visitors, to, the, valley, often, included, scientists, artists, and, celebrities, many, of, whom, made, a, point, of, meeting, with, muir, muir, maintained, a, close, friendship, for, 38, years, with, william, keith, a, california, landscape, painter, they, were, both, born, the, same, year, in, scotland, and, shared, a, love, for, the, mountains, of, california, in, 1871, after, muir, had, lived, in, yosemite, for, three, years, emerson, with, several, friends, and, family, arrived, in, yosemite, during, a, tour, of, the, western, united, states, 105, 46, the, two, men, met, and, according, to, tallmadge, emerson, was, delighted, to, find, at, the, end, of, his, career, the, prophet, naturalist, he, had, called, for, so, long, ago, and, for, muir, emerson, s, visit, came, like, a, laying, on, of, hands, 53, emerson, spent, one, day, with, muir, and, he, offered, him, a, teaching, position, at, harvard, which, muir, declined, muir, later, wrote, i, never, for, a, moment, thought, of, giving, up, god, s, big, show, for, a, mere, profship, 53, muir, also, spent, time, with, photographer, carleton, watkins, and, studied, his, photographs, of, yosemite, pursuit, of, his, love, of, science, especially, geology, often, occupied, his, free, time, muir, soon, became, convinced, that, glaciers, had, sculpted, many, of, the, features, of, the, yosemite, valley, and, surrounding, area, this, notion, was, in, strong, contradiction, to, the, accepted, contemporary, theory, promulgated, by, josiah, whitney, head, of, the, california, geological, survey, which, attributed, the, formation, of, the, valley, to, a, catastrophic, earthquake, as, muir, s, ideas, spread, whitney, tried, to, discredit, muir, by, branding, him, as, an, amateur, but, louis, agassiz, the, premier, geologist, of, the, day, saw, merit, in, muir, s, ideas, and, lauded, him, as, the, first, man, i, have, ever, found, who, has, any, adequate, conception, of, glacial, action, in, 1871, muir, discovered, an, active, alpine, glacier, below, merced, peak, which, helped, his, theories, gain, acceptance, a, large, earthquake, centered, near, lone, pine, in, owens, valley, strongly, shook, occupants, of, yosemite, valley, in, march, 1872, the, quake, woke, muir, in, the, early, morning, and, he, ran, out, of, his, cabin, both, glad, and, frightened, exclaiming, a, noble, earthquake, other, valley, settlers, who, believed, whitney, s, ideas, feared, that, the, quake, was, a, prelude, to, a, cataclysmic, deepening, of, the, valley, muir, had, no, such, fear, and, promptly, made, a, moonlit, survey, of, new, talus, piles, created, by, earthquake, triggered, rockslides, this, event, led, more, people, to, believe, in, muir, s, ideas, about, the, formation, of, the, valley, in, addition, to, his, geologic, studies, muir, also, investigated, the, plant, life, of, the, yosemite, area, in, 1873, and, 1874, he, made, field, studies, along, the, western, flank, of, the, sierra, on, the, distribution, and, ecology, of, isolated, groves, of, giant, sequoia, in, 1876, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, published, muir, s, paper, on, the, subject, between, 1879, and, 1899, muir, made, seven, trips, to, alaska, as, far, as, unalaska, and, barrow, muir, mr, young, fort, wrangell, missionary, and, a, group, of, native, american, guides, first, traveled, to, alaska, in, 1879, and, were, the, first, euro, americans, to, explore, glacier, bay, muir, glacier, was, later, named, after, him, he, traveled, into, british, columbia, a, third, of, the, way, up, the, stikine, river, likening, its, grand, canyon, to, a, yosemite, that, was, a, hundred, miles, long, muir, recorded, over, 300, glaciers, along, the, river, s, course, he, returned, for, further, explorations, in, southeast, alaska, in, 1880, and, in, 1881, was, with, the, party, that, landed, on, wrangel, island, on, the, uss, corwin, and, claimed, that, island, for, the, united, states, he, documented, this, experience, in, journal, entries, and, newspaper, articles, later, compiled, and, edited, into, his, book, the, cruise, of, the, corwin, in, 1888, after, seven, years, of, managing, the, strentzel, fruit, ranch, in, alhambra, valley, california, his, health, began, to, suffer, he, returned, to, the, hills, to, recover, climbing, mount, rainier, in, washington, and, writing, ascent, of, mount, rainier, muir, threw, himself, into, the, preservationist, role, with, great, vigor, he, envisioned, the, yosemite, area, and, the, sierra, as, pristine, lands, he, thought, the, greatest, threat, to, the, yosemite, area, and, the, sierra, was, domesticated, livestock, especially, domestic, sheep, which, he, referred, to, as, hoofed, locusts, in, june, 1889, the, influential, associate, editor, of, the, century, magazine, robert, underwood, johnson, camped, with, muir, in, tuolumne, meadows, and, saw, firsthand, the, damage, a, large, flock, of, sheep, had, done, to, the, grassland, johnson, agreed, to, publish, any, article, muir, wrote, on, the, subject, of, excluding, livestock, from, the, sierra, high, country, he, also, agreed, to, use, his, influence, to, introduce, a, bill, to, congress, to, make, the, yosemite, area, into, a, national, park, modeled, after, yellowstone, national, park, on, september, 30, 1890, the, us, congress, passed, a, bill, that, essentially, followed, recommendations, that, muir, had, suggested, in, two, century, articles, the, treasures, of, the, yosemite, and, features, of, the, proposed, national, park, both, published, in, 1890, but, to, muir, s, dismay, the, bill, left, yosemite, valley, under, state, control, as, it, had, been, since, the, 1860s, in, early, 1892, professor, henry, senger, a, philologist, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, contacted, muir, with, the, idea, of, forming, a, local, alpine, club, for, mountain, lovers, senger, and, san, francisco, attorney, warren, olney, sent, out, invitations, for, the, purpose, of, forming, a, sierra, club, mr, john, muir, will, preside, on, may, 28, 1892, the, first, meeting, of, the, sierra, club, was, held, to, write, articles, of, incorporation, one, week, later, muir, was, elected, president, warren, olney, was, elected, vice, president, and, a, board, of, directors, was, chosen, that, included, david, starr, jordan, president, of, the, new, stanford, university, muir, remained, president, until, his, death, 22, years, later, 107, 108, the, sierra, club, immediately, opposed, efforts, to, reduce, yosemite, national, park, by, half, and, began, holding, educational, and, scientific, meetings, at, one, meeting, in, the, fall, of, 1895, that, included, muir, joseph, leconte, and, william, r, dudley, the, sierra, club, discussed, the, idea, of, establishing, national, forest, reservations, which, were, later, called, national, forests, the, sierra, club, was, active, in, the, successful, campaign, to, transfer, yosemite, national, park, from, state, to, federal, control, in, 1906, the, fight, to, preserve, hetch, hetchy, valley, was, also, taken, up, by, the, sierra, club, with, some, prominent, san, francisco, members, opposing, the, fight, eventually, a, vote, was, held, that, overwhelmingly, put, the, sierra, club, behind, the, opposition, to, hetch, hetchy, dam, in, july, 1896, muir, became, associated, with, gifford, pinchot, a, national, leader, in, the, conservation, movement, pinchot, was, the, first, head, of, the, united, states, forest, service, and, a, leading, spokesman, for, the, sustainable, use, of, natural, resources, for, the, benefit, of, the, people, his, views, eventually, clashed, with, muir, s, and, highlighted, two, diverging, views, of, the, use, of, the, country, s, natural, resources, pinchot, saw, conservation, as, a, means, of, managing, the, nation, s, natural, resources, for, long, term, sustainable, commercial, use, as, a, professional, forester, his, view, was, that, forestry, is, tree, farming, without, destroying, the, long, term, viability, of, the, forests, muir, valued, nature, for, its, spiritual, and, transcendental, qualities, in, one, essay, about, the, national, parks, he, referred, to, them, as, places, for, rest, inspiration, and, prayers, he, often, encouraged, city, dwellers, to, experience, nature, for, its, spiritual, nourishment, both, men, opposed, reckless, exploitation, of, natural, resources, including, clear, cutting, of, forests, even, muir, acknowledged, the, need, for, timber, and, the, forests, to, provide, it, but, pinchot, s, view, of, wilderness, management, was, more, resource, oriented, their, friendship, ended, late, in, the, summer, of, 1897, when, pinchot, released, a, statement, to, a, seattle, newspaper, supporting, sheep, grazing, in, forest, reserves, muir, confronted, pinchot, and, demanded, an, explanation, when, pinchot, reiterated, his, position, muir, told, him, i, don, t, want, any, thing, more, to, do, with, you, this, philosophical, divide, soon, expanded, and, split, the, conservation, movement, into, two, camps, the, preservationists, led, by, muir, and, pinchot, s, camp, who, used, the, term, conservation, the, two, men, debated, their, positions, in, popular, magazines, such, as, outlook, harper, s, weekly, atlantic, monthly, world, s, work, and, century, their, contrasting, views, were, highlighted, again, when, the, united, states, was, deciding, whether, to, dam, hetch, hetchy, valley, pinchot, favored, damming, the, valley, as, the, highest, possible, use, which, could, be, made, of, it, in, contrast, muir, proclaimed, dam, hetch, hetchy, as, well, dam, for, water, tanks, the, people, s, cathedrals, and, churches, for, no, holier, temple, has, ever, been, consecrated, by, the, hearts, of, man, in, 1899, muir, accompanied, railroad, executive, e, h, harriman, and, esteemed, scientists, on, the, famous, exploratory, voyage, along, the, alaska, coast, aboard, the, luxuriously, refitted, 250, foot, 76, m, steamer, the, george, w, elder, he, later, relied, on, his, friendship, with, harriman, to, pressure, congress, to, pass, conservation, legislation, in, 1903, president, theodore, roosevelt, accompanied, muir, on, a, visit, to, yosemite, muir, joined, roosevelt, in, oakland, california, for, the, train, trip, to, raymond, the, presidential, entourage, then, traveled, by, stagecoach, into, the, park, while, traveling, to, the, park, muir, told, the, president, about, state, mismanagement, of, the, valley, and, rampant, exploitation, of, the, valley, s, resources, even, before, they, entered, the, park, he, was, able, to, convince, roosevelt, that, the, best, way, to, protect, the, valley, was, through, federal, control, and, management, after, entering, the, park, and, seeing, the, magnificent, splendor, of, the, valley, the, president, asked, muir, to, show, him, the, real, yosemite, muir, and, roosevelt, set, off, largely, by, themselves, and, camped, in, the, back, country, the, duo, talked, late, into, the, night, slept, in, the, brisk, open, air, of, glacier, point, and, were, dusted, by, a, fresh, snowfall, in, the, morning, it, was, a, night, roosevelt, never, forgot, he, later, told, a, crowd, lying, out, at, night, under, those, giant, sequoias, was, like, lying, in, a, temple, built, by, no, hand, of, man, a, temple, grander, than, any, human, architect, could, by, any, possibility, build, muir, too, cherished, the, camping, trip, camping, with, the, president, was, a, remarkable, experience, he, wrote, i, fairly, fell, in, love, with, him, muir, then, increased, efforts, by, the, sierra, club, to, consolidate, park, management, in, 1906, congress, transferred, the, mariposa, grove, and, yosemite, valley, to, the, park, in, his, life, muir, published, six, volumes, of, writings, all, describing, explorations, of, natural, settings, four, additional, books, were, published, posthumously, several, books, were, subsequently, published, that, collected, essays, and, articles, from, various, sources, miller, writes, that, what, was, most, important, about, his, writings, was, not, their, quantity, but, their, quality, he, notes, that, they, have, had, a, lasting, effect, on, american, culture, in, helping, to, create, the, desire, and, will, to, protect, and, preserve, wild, and, natural, environments, 173, his, first, appearance, in, print, was, by, accident, writes, miller, a, person, he, did, not, know, submitted, without, his, permission, or, awareness, a, personal, letter, to, his, friend, jeanne, carr, describing, calypso, borealis, a, rare, flower, he, had, encountered, the, piece, was, published, anonymously, identified, as, having, been, written, by, an, inspired, pilgrim, 174, throughout, his, many, years, as, a, nature, writer, muir, frequently, rewrote, and, expanded, on, earlier, writings, from, his, journals, as, well, as, articles, published, in, magazines, he, often, compiled, and, organized, such, earlier, writings, as, collections, of, essays, or, included, them, as, part, of, narrative, books, 173, muir, s, friendship, with, jeanne, carr, had, a, lifelong, influence, on, his, career, as, a, naturalist, and, writer, they, first, met, in, the, fall, of, 1860, when, at, age, 22, he, entered, a, number, of, his, homemade, inventions, in, the, wisconsin, state, agricultural, society, fair, carr, a, fair, assistant, was, asked, by, fair, officials, to, review, muir, s, exhibits, to, see, if, they, had, merit, she, thought, they, did, and, saw, in, his, entries, evidence, of, genius, worthy, of, special, recognition, notes, miller, 33, as, a, result, muir, received, a, diploma, and, a, monetary, award, for, his, handmade, clocks, and, thermometer, 1, during, the, next, three, years, while, a, student, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, he, was, befriended, by, carr, and, her, husband, ezra, a, professor, at, the, same, university, according, to, muir, biographer, bonnie, johanna, gisel, the, carrs, recognized, his, pure, mind, unsophisticated, nature, inherent, curiosity, scholarly, acumen, and, independent, thought, jeanne, carr, 35, years, of, age, especially, appreciated, his, youthful, individuality, along, with, his, acceptance, of, religious, truths, that, were, much, like, her, own, 2, muir, was, often, invited, to, the, carrs, home, he, shared, jeanne, s, love, of, plants, in, 1864, he, left, wisconsin, to, begin, exploring, the, canadian, wilderness, and, while, there, began, corresponding, with, her, about, his, activities, carr, wrote, muir, in, return, and, encouraged, him, in, his, explorations, and, writings, eventually, having, an, important, influence, over, his, personal, goals, at, one, point, she, asked, muir, to, read, a, book, she, felt, would, influence, his, thinking, lamartine, s, the, stonemason, of, saint, point, it, was, the, story, of, a, man, whose, life, she, hoped, would, metabolize, in, muir, writes, gisel, and, was, a, projection, of, the, life, she, envisioned, for, him, according, to, gisel, the, story, was, about, a, poor, man, with, a, pure, heart, who, found, in, nature, divine, lessons, and, saw, all, of, god, s, creatures, interconnected, 3, after, muir, returned, to, the, united, states, he, spent, the, next, four, years, exploring, yosemite, while, at, the, same, time, writing, articles, for, publication, during, those, years, muir, and, carr, continued, corresponding, she, sent, many, of, her, friends, to, yosemite, to, meet, muir, and, to, hear, him, preach, the, gospel, of, the, mountains, writes, gisel, the, most, notable, was, naturalist, and, author, ralph, waldo, emerson, the, importance, of, carr, who, continually, gave, muir, reassurance, and, inspiration, cannot, be, overestimated, adds, gisel, it, was, through, his, letters, to, her, that, he, developed, a, voice, and, purpose, she, also, tried, to, promote, muir, s, writings, by, submitting, his, letters, to, a, monthly, magazine, for, publication, muir, came, to, trust, carr, as, his, spiritual, mother, and, they, remained, friends, for, 30, years, 6, in, one, letter, she, wrote, to, muir, while, he, was, living, in, yosemite, she, tried, to, keep, him, from, despairing, as, to, his, purpose, in, life, 43, the, value, of, their, friendship, was, first, disclosed, by, a, friend, of, carr, s, clergyman, and, writer, g, wharton, james, after, obtaining, copies, of, their, private, letters, from, carr, and, despite, pleadings, from, muir, to, return, them, he, instead, published, articles, about, their, friendship, using, those, letters, as, a, primary, source, in, one, such, article, his, focus, was, muir, s, debt, to, carr, stating, that, she, was, his, guiding, star, who, led, him, into, the, noble, paths, of, life, and, then, kept, him, there, 87, 88, john, charles, van, dyke, was, an, author, and, professor, of, art, at, rutgers, college, now, rutgers, state, university, of, new, jersey, his, nephew, dix, strong, van, dyke, had, gone, to, daggett, california, to, seek, his, fortune, like, his, uncle, dix, was, an, author, who, wrote, daggett, life, in, a, mojave, frontier, town, creating, the, north, american, landscape, john, muir, found, his, way, to, daggett, and, had, many, conversations, with, the, uncle, and, nephew, van, dyke, at, the, dix, ranch, this, likely, had, an, effect, on, his, writings, his, daughter, helen, married, frank, buel, and, lived, in, daggett, muir, s, friend, zoologist, henry, fairfield, osborn, writes, that, muir, s, style, of, writing, did, not, come, to, him, easily, but, only, with, intense, effort, daily, he, rose, at, 4, 30, o, clock, and, after, a, simple, cup, of, coffee, labored, incessantly, he, groans, over, his, labors, he, writes, and, rewrites, and, interpolates, osborn, notes, that, he, preferred, using, the, simplest, english, language, and, therefore, admired, above, all, the, writings, of, carlyle, emerson, and, thoreau, he, is, a, very, firm, believer, in, thoreau, and, starts, by, reading, deeply, of, this, author, 29, his, secretary, marion, randall, parsons, also, noted, that, composition, was, always, slow, and, laborious, for, him, each, sentence, each, phrase, each, word, underwent, his, critical, scrutiny, not, once, but, twenty, times, before, he, was, satisfied, to, let, it, stand, muir, often, told, her, this, business, of, writing, books, is, a, long, tiresome, endless, job, 33, miller, speculates, that, muir, recycled, his, earlier, writings, partly, due, to, his, dislike, of, the, writing, process, he, adds, that, muir, did, not, enjoy, the, work, finding, it, difficult, and, tedious, he, was, generally, unsatisfied, with, the, finished, result, finding, prose, a, weak, instrument, for, the, reality, he, wished, to, convey, 173, however, he, was, prodded, by, friends, and, his, wife, to, keep, writing, and, as, a, result, of, their, influence, he, kept, at, it, although, never, satisfied, muir, wrote, in, 1872, no, amount, of, word, making, will, ever, make, a, single, soul, to, know, these, mountains, one, day, s, exposure, to, mountains, is, better, than, a, cartload, of, books, xviii, in, one, of, his, essays, he, gave, an, example, of, the, deficiencies, of, writing, versus, experiencing, nature, muir, believed, that, to, discover, truth, he, must, turn, to, what, he, believed, were, the, most, accurate, sources, in, his, book, the, story, of, my, boyhood, and, youth, 1913, he, writes, that, during, his, childhood, his, father, made, him, read, the, bible, every, day, muir, eventually, memorized, three, quarters, of, the, old, testament, and, all, of, the, new, testament, 20, muir, s, father, read, josephus, s, war, of, the, jews, to, understand, the, culture, of, first, century, judea, as, it, was, written, by, an, eyewitness, and, illuminated, the, culture, during, the, period, of, the, new, testament, 43, but, as, muir, became, attached, to, the, american, natural, landscapes, he, explored, williams, notes, that, he, began, to, see, another, primary, source, for, understanding, god, the, book, of, nature, according, to, williams, in, nature, especially, in, the, wilderness, muir, was, able, to, study, the, plants, and, animals, in, an, environment, that, he, believed, came, straight, from, the, hand, of, god, uncorrupted, by, civilization, and, domestication, 43, as, tallmadge, notes, muir, s, belief, in, this, book, of, nature, compelled, him, to, tell, the, story, of, this, creation, in, words, any, reader, could, understand, as, a, result, his, writings, were, to, become, prophecy, for, sought, to, change, our, angle, of, vision, 53, williams, notes, that, muir, s, philosophy, and, world, view, rotated, around, his, perceived, dichotomy, between, civilization, and, nature, from, this, developed, his, core, belief, that, wild, is, superior, 41, his, nature, writings, became, a, synthesis, of, natural, theology, with, scripture, that, helped, him, understand, the, origins, of, the, natural, world, according, to, williams, philosophers, and, theologians, such, as, thomas, dick, suggested, that, the, best, place, to, discover, the, true, attributes, of, deity, was, in, nature, he, came, to, believe, that, god, was, always, active, in, the, creation, of, life, and, thereby, kept, the, natural, order, of, the, world, 41, as, a, result, muir, styled, himself, as, a, john, the, baptist, adds, williams, whose, duty, was, to, immerse, in, mountain, baptism, everyone, he, could, 46, williams, concludes, that, muir, saw, nature, as, a, great, teacher, revealing, the, mind, of, god, and, this, belief, became, the, central, theme, of, his, later, journeys, and, the, subtext, of, his, nature, writing, 50, during, his, career, as, writer, and, while, living, in, the, mountains, muir, continued, to, experience, the, presence, of, the, divine, in, nature, writes, holmes, 5, 317, his, personal, letters, also, conveyed, these, feelings, of, ecstasy, historian, catherine, albanese, stated, that, in, one, of, his, letters, muir, s, eucharist, made, thoreau, s, feast, on, wood, chuck, and, huckleberry, seem, almost, anemic, muir, was, extremely, fond, of, thoreau, and, was, probably, influenced, more, by, him, than, even, emerson, muir, often, referred, to, himself, as, a, disciple, of, thoreau, 100, during, his, first, summer, in, the, sierra, as, a, shepherd, muir, wrote, field, notes, that, emphasized, the, role, that, the, senses, play, in, human, perceptions, of, the, environment, according, to, williams, he, speculated, that, the, world, was, an, unchanging, entity, that, was, interpreted, by, the, brain, through, the, senses, and, writes, muir, if, the, creator, were, to, bestow, a, new, set, of, senses, upon, us, we, would, never, doubt, that, we, were, in, another, world, 43, while, doing, his, studies, of, nature, he, would, try, to, remember, everything, he, observed, as, if, his, senses, were, recording, the, impressions, until, he, could, write, them, in, his, journal, as, a, result, of, his, intense, desire, to, remember, facts, he, filled, his, field, journals, with, notes, on, precipitation, temperature, and, even, cloud, formations, 45, however, muir, took, his, journal, entries, further, than, recording, factual, observations, williams, notes, that, the, observations, he, recorded, amounted, to, a, description, of, the, sublimity, of, nature, and, what, amounted, to, an, aesthetic, and, spiritual, notebook, muir, felt, that, his, task, was, more, than, just, recording, phenomena, but, also, to, illuminate, the, spiritual, implications, of, those, phenomena, writes, williams, for, muir, mountain, skies, for, example, seemed, painted, with, light, and, came, to, symbolize, divinity, 45, he, often, described, his, observations, in, terms, of, light, muir, biographer, steven, holmes, notes, that, muir, used, words, like, glory, and, glorious, to, suggest, that, light, was, taking, on, a, religious, dimension, it, is, impossible, to, overestimate, the, importance, of, the, notion, of, glory, in, muir, s, published, writings, where, no, other, single, image, carries, more, emotional, or, religious, weight, 178, adding, that, his, words, exactly, parallels, its, hebraic, origins, in, which, biblical, writings, often, indicate, a, divine, presence, with, light, as, in, the, burning, bush, or, pillar, of, fire, and, described, as, the, glory, of, god, 179, 24, muir, often, used, the, term, home, as, a, metaphor, for, both, nature, and, his, general, attitude, toward, the, natural, world, itself, notes, holmes, he, often, used, domestic, language, to, describe, his, scientific, observations, as, when, he, saw, nature, as, providing, a, home, for, even, the, smallest, plant, life, the, little, purple, plant, tended, by, its, maker, closed, its, petals, crouched, low, in, its, crevice, of, a, home, and, enjoyed, the, storm, in, safety, 57, muir, also, saw, nature, as, his, own, home, as, when, he, wrote, friends, and, described, the, sierra, as, god, s, mountain, mansion, he, considered, not, only, the, mountains, as, home, however, as, he, also, felt, a, closeness, even, to, the, smallest, objects, the, very, stones, seem, talkative, sympathetic, brotherly, no, wonder, when, we, consider, that, we, all, have, the, same, father, and, mother, 319, in, his, later, years, he, used, the, metaphor, of, nature, as, home, in, his, writings, to, promote, wilderness, preservation, 1, not, surprisingly, muir, s, deep, seated, feeling, about, nature, as, being, his, true, home, led, to, tension, with, his, family, at, his, home, in, martinez, california, he, once, told, a, visitor, to, his, ranch, there, this, is, a, good, place, to, be, housed, in, during, stormy, weather, to, write, in, and, to, raise, children, in, but, it, is, not, my, home, up, there, pointing, towards, the, sierra, nevada, is, my, home, 74, muir, s, expressed, mixed, attitudes, towards, native, americans, over, his, life, from, sympathy, to, distaste, he, saw, nature, as, ideal, when, it, was, free, from, man, s, influence, including, native, americans, but, he, did, not, recognize, that, the, landscapes, he, loved, had, been, shaped, by, native, americans, for, millennia, his, earliest, encounters, during, his, childhood, in, wisconsin, were, with, winnebago, indians, who, begged, for, food, and, stole, his, favorite, horse, in, spite, of, that, he, had, expressed, sympathy, for, their, being, robbed, of, their, lands, and, pushed, ruthlessly, back, into, narrower, and, narrower, limits, by, alien, races, who, were, cutting, off, their, means, of, livelihood, his, early, encounters, with, the, paiute, in, california, left, him, feeling, ambivalent, after, seeing, their, lifestyle, which, he, described, as, lazy, and, superstitious, muir, wrote, of, the, miwoks, in, yosemite, as, most, ugly, and, some, of, them, altogether, hideous, and, that, they, seemed, to, have, no, right, place, in, the, landscape, and, i, was, glad, to, see, them, fading, out, of, sight, down, the, pass, ecofeminist, philosopher, carolyn, merchant, has, criticized, muir, believing, that, he, wrote, disparagingly, of, the, native, americans, he, encountered, in, his, early, explorations, later, after, living, with, indians, he, praised, and, grew, more, respectful, of, their, low, impact, on, the, wilderness, compared, to, the, heavy, impact, by, european, americans, however, in, his, journals, he, often, describes, those, he, encounters, as, dirty, irregular, and, unnatural, muir, was, given, the, stickeen, muir, s, spelling, coastal, tribe, name, ancoutahan, meaning, adopted, chief, in, response, to, claims, about, muir, s, attitudes, about, native, americans, sierra, club, national, board, member, chad, hanson, wrote, muir, wrote, repeatedly, about, the, intelligence, and, dignity, of, native, americans, and, honored, how, traditional, indigenous, peoples, lived, in, peaceful, coexistence, with, nature, and, wild, creatures, expressing, his, view, that, native, peoples, rank, above, white, settlers, who, he, increasingly, described, as, selfish, base, and, lacking, honor, this, would, become, a, constant, theme, in, muir, s, writings, as, he, attacked, the, dominant, white, culture, s, destructive, and, greedy, ways, and, its, anthrosupremacist, mindset, that, placed, humans, above, all, else, and, recognized, no, intrinsic, value, in, ecosystems, or, wildlife, species, beyond, whatever, profit, could, be, gained, by, exploiting, them, muir, spoke, and, wrote, about, the, equality, of, all, people, regardless, of, color, or, race, and, wrote, about, the, immorality, of, slavery, in, his, final, book, travels, in, alaska, during, his, time, in, alaska, he, also, wrote, how, we, were, all, children, of, one, father, sketched, the, characteristics, of, the, different, races, of, mankind, showing, that, no, matter, how, far, apart, their, countries, were, how, they, differed, in, color, size, language, etc, and, no, matter, how, different, and, how, various, the, ways, in, which, they, got, a, living, that, the, white, man, and, all, the, people, of, the, world, were, essentially, alike, that, we, all, had, ten, fingers, and, toes, and, our, bodies, were, the, same, whether, white, brown, black, or, different, colors, and, speak, different, languages, in, his, earlier, years, muir, did, make, some, disparaging, remarks, about, african, americans, in, a, thousand, mile, walk, to, the, gulf, muir, described, african, americans, as, well, trained, but, making, a, great, deal, of, noise, and, doing, little, work, one, energetic, white, man, working, with, a, will, would, easily, pick, as, much, cotton, as, half, a, dozen, sambos, and, sallies, describing, the, sight, of, two, african, americans, at, a, campfire, he, wrote, i, could, see, their, ivory, gleaming, from, the, great, lips, and, their, smooth, cheeks, flashing, off, light, as, if, made, of, glass, seen, anywhere, but, in, the, south, the, glossy, pair, would, have, been, taken, for, twin, devils, but, here, it, was, only, a, negro, and, his, wife, at, their, supper, however, at, no, point, in, muir, s, personal, journey, to, the, gulf, did, he, support, or, empathize, with, the, southern, cause, avoiding, entreaties, from, southern, hosts, when, they, prodded, him, in, 2020, in, light, of, the, movement, to, remove, confederate, monuments, across, the, country, michael, brune, the, executive, director, of, the, sierra, club, reflected, on, muir, s, complex, and, controversial, legacy, and, announced, that, the, club, would, shift, towards, investing, in, racial, justice, work, and, determine, which, of, its, monuments, need, to, be, renamed, or, removed, on, july, 22, 2020, the, sierra, club, wrote, muir, was, not, immune, to, the, racism, peddled, by, many, in, the, early, conservation, movement, he, made, derogatory, comments, about, black, people, and, indigenous, peoples, that, drew, on, deeply, harmful, racist, stereotypes, though, his, views, evolved, later, in, his, life, as, the, most, iconic, figure, in, sierra, club, history, muir, s, words, and, actions, carry, an, especially, heavy, weight, they, continue, to, hurt, and, alienate, indigenous, people, and, people, of, color, who, come, into, contact, with, the, sierra, club, some, of, muir, s, associates, cited, by, brune, and, others, such, as, joseph, leconte, david, starr, jordan, and, henry, fairfield, osborn, were, closely, related, to, the, early, eugenics, movement, in, the, united, states, some, claim, muir, did, not, espouse, such, beliefs, aaron, mair, who, in, 2015, became, the, first, black, president, of, the, sierra, club, board, stated, that, the, contents, and, framing, of, muir, in, brune, s, post, are, a, misrepresentation, mair, went, on, to, state, that, brune, did, not, consult, him, or, the, other, two, black, board, members, before, pushing, ahead, on, what, he, called, a, revisionist, and, ahistorical, account, of, muir, s, writings, thoughts, and, life, mair, along, with, two, other, sierra, club, board, members, chad, hanson, and, mary, ann, nelson, wrote, a, response, to, brune, s, attack, on, muir, writing, while, some, of, muir, s, colleagues, promoted, white, supremacist, myths, and, exclusionary, views, regarding, national, parks, and, forests, muir, spoke, out, about, the, importance, of, making, these, areas, accessible, and, encouraging, all, people, to, experience, them, writing, few, are, altogether, deaf, to, the, preaching, of, pine, trees, their, sermons, on, the, mountains, go, to, our, hearts, and, if, people, in, general, could, be, got, into, the, woods, even, for, once, to, hear, the, trees, speak, for, themselves, all, difficulties, in, the, way, of, forest, preservation, would, vanish, he, came, to, believe, deeply, in, the, equality, of, all, people, writing, we, all, flow, from, one, fountain, soul, all, are, expressions, of, one, love, god, does, not, appear, and, flow, out, only, from, narrow, chinks, and, round, bored, wells, here, and, there, in, favored, races, and, places, with, population, growth, continuing, in, san, francisco, political, pressure, increased, to, dam, the, tuolumne, river, for, use, as, a, water, reservoir, muir, passionately, opposed, the, damming, of, hetch, hetchy, valley, because, he, found, hetch, hetchy, as, stunning, as, yosemite, valley, 249, 62, muir, the, sierra, club, and, robert, underwood, johnson, fought, against, inundating, the, valley, muir, wrote, to, president, roosevelt, pleading, for, him, to, scuttle, the, project, roosevelt, s, successor, william, howard, taft, suspended, the, interior, department, s, approval, for, the, hetch, hetchy, right, of, way, after, years, of, national, debate, taft, s, successor, woodrow, wilson, signed, the, bill, authorizing, the, dam, into, law, on, december, 19, 1913, muir, felt, a, great, loss, from, the, destruction, of, the, valley, his, last, major, battle, he, wrote, to, his, friend, vernon, kellogg, as, to, the, loss, of, the, sierra, park, valley, it, s, hard, to, bear, the, destruction, of, the, charming, groves, and, gardens, the, finest, in, all, california, goes, to, my, heart, in, 1878, when, he, was, nearing, the, age, of, 40, muir, s, friends, pressured, him, to, return, to, society, soon, after, he, returned, to, the, oakland, area, he, was, introduced, by, jeanne, carr, to, louisa, strentzel, daughter, of, a, prominent, physician, and, horticulturist, with, a, 2, 600, acre, 11, km, 2, fruit, orchard, in, martinez, california, northeast, of, oakland, in, 1880, after, he, returned, from, a, trip, to, alaska, muir, and, strentzel, married, john, muir, went, into, partnership, with, his, father, in, law, john, strentzel, and, for, ten, years, directed, most, of, his, energy, into, managing, this, large, fruit, farm, although, muir, was, a, loyal, dedicated, husband, and, father, of, two, daughters, his, heart, remained, wild, writes, marquis, his, wife, understood, his, needs, and, after, seeing, his, restlessness, at, the, ranch, would, sometimes, shoo, him, back, up, to, the, mountains, he, sometimes, took, his, daughters, with, him, the, house, and, part, of, the, ranch, are, now, the, john, muir, national, historic, site, in, addition, the, w, h, c, folsom, house, where,
