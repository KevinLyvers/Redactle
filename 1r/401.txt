william, blake, 28, november, 1757, 12, august, 1827, was, an, english, poet, painter, and, printmaker, largely, unrecognised, during, his, life, blake, has, become, a, seminal, figure, in, the, history, of, the, poetry, and, visual, art, of, the, romantic, age, what, he, called, his, prophetic, works, were, said, by, 20th, century, critic, northrop, frye, to, form, what, is, in, proportion, to, its, merits, the, least, read, body, of, poetry, in, the, english, language, while, he, lived, in, london, his, entire, life, except, for, three, years, spent, in, felpham, he, produced, a, diverse, and, symbolically, rich, collection, of, works, which, embraced, the, imagination, as, the, body, of, god, or, human, existence, itself, although, blake, was, considered, mad, by, contemporaries, for, his, idiosyncratic, views, he, came, to, be, highly, regarded, by, later, critics, and, readers, for, his, expressiveness, and, creativity, and, for, the, philosophical, and, mystical, undercurrents, within, his, work, his, paintings, and, poetry, have, been, characterised, as, part, of, the, romantic, movement, and, as, pre, romantic, a, theist, who, preferred, his, own, marcionite, style, of, theology, he, was, hostile, to, the, church, of, england, indeed, to, almost, all, forms, of, organised, religion, and, was, influenced, by, the, ideals, and, ambitions, of, the, french, and, american, revolutions, although, later, he, rejected, many, of, these, political, beliefs, he, maintained, an, amicable, relationship, with, the, political, activist, thomas, paine, he, was, also, influenced, by, thinkers, such, as, emanuel, swedenborg, despite, these, known, influences, the, singularity, of, blake, s, work, makes, him, difficult, to, classify, the, 19th, century, scholar, william, michael, rossetti, characterised, him, as, a, glorious, luminary, and, a, man, not, forestalled, by, predecessors, nor, to, be, classed, with, contemporaries, nor, to, be, replaced, by, known, or, readily, surmisable, successors, collaboration, with, his, wife, catherine, boucher, was, instrumental, in, the, creation, of, many, of, his, books, boucher, worked, as, a, printmaker, and, colorist, for, his, works, for, almost, forty, five, years, she, was, the, person, who, lived, and, worked, most, closely, with, blake, enabling, him, to, realize, numerous, projects, impossible, without, her, assistance, catherine, was, an, artist, and, printer, in, her, own, right, writes, literary, scholar, angus, whitehead, william, blake, was, born, on, 28, november, 1757, at, 28, broad, street, now, broadwick, street, in, soho, london, he, was, the, third, of, seven, children, two, of, whom, died, in, infancy, blake, s, father, james, was, a, hosier, who, had, lived, in, london, he, attended, school, only, long, enough, to, learn, reading, and, writing, leaving, at, the, age, of, 10, and, was, otherwise, educated, at, home, by, his, mother, catherine, blake, n, e, wright, even, though, the, blakes, were, english, dissenters, william, was, baptised, on, 11, december, at, st, james, s, church, piccadilly, london, the, bible, was, an, early, and, profound, influence, on, blake, and, remained, a, source, of, inspiration, throughout, his, life, blake, s, childhood, according, to, him, included, mystical, religious, experiences, such, as, beholding, god, s, face, pressed, against, his, window, seeing, angels, among, the, haystacks, and, being, visited, by, the, old, testament, prophet, ezekiel, blake, started, engraving, copies, of, drawings, of, greek, antiquities, purchased, for, him, by, his, father, a, practice, that, was, preferred, to, actual, drawing, within, these, drawings, blake, found, his, first, exposure, to, classical, forms, through, the, work, of, raphael, michelangelo, maarten, van, heemskerck, and, albrecht, d, rer, the, number, of, prints, and, bound, books, that, james, and, catherine, were, able, to, purchase, for, young, william, suggests, that, the, blakes, enjoyed, at, least, for, a, time, a, comfortable, wealth, when, william, was, ten, years, old, his, parents, knew, enough, of, his, headstrong, temperament, that, he, was, not, sent, to, school, but, instead, enrolled, in, drawing, classes, at, henry, pars, drawing, school, in, the, strand, he, read, avidly, on, subjects, of, his, own, choosing, during, this, period, blake, made, explorations, into, poetry, his, early, work, displays, knowledge, of, ben, jonson, edmund, spenser, and, the, psalms, on, 4, august, 1772, blake, was, apprenticed, to, engraver, james, basire, of, great, queen, street, at, the, sum, of, 52, 10, for, a, term, of, seven, years, at, the, end, of, the, term, aged, 21, he, became, a, professional, engraver, no, record, survives, of, any, serious, disagreement, or, conflict, between, the, two, during, the, period, of, blake, s, apprenticeship, but, peter, ackroyd, s, biography, notes, that, blake, later, added, basire, s, name, to, a, list, of, artistic, adversaries, and, then, crossed, it, out, this, aside, basire, s, style, of, line, engraving, was, of, a, kind, held, at, the, time, to, be, old, fashioned, compared, to, the, flashier, stipple, or, mezzotint, styles, it, has, been, speculated, that, blake, s, instruction, in, this, outmoded, form, may, have, been, detrimental, to, his, acquiring, of, work, or, recognition, in, later, life, after, two, years, basire, sent, his, apprentice, to, copy, images, from, the, gothic, churches, in, london, perhaps, to, settle, a, quarrel, between, blake, and, james, parker, his, fellow, apprentice, his, experiences, in, westminster, abbey, helped, form, his, artistic, style, and, ideas, the, abbey, of, his, day, was, decorated, with, suits, of, armour, painted, funeral, effigies, and, varicoloured, waxworks, ackroyd, notes, that, the, most, immediate, would, have, been, of, faded, brightness, and, colour, this, close, study, of, the, gothic, which, he, saw, as, the, living, form, left, clear, traces, in, his, style, in, the, long, afternoons, blake, spent, sketching, in, the, abbey, he, was, occasionally, interrupted, by, boys, from, westminster, school, who, were, allowed, in, the, abbey, they, teased, him, and, one, tormented, him, so, much, that, blake, knocked, the, boy, off, a, scaffold, to, the, ground, upon, which, he, fell, with, terrific, violence, after, blake, complained, to, the, dean, the, schoolboys, privilege, was, withdrawn, blake, claimed, that, he, experienced, visions, in, the, abbey, he, saw, christ, with, his, apostles, and, a, great, procession, of, monks, and, priests, and, heard, their, chant, on, 8, october, 1779, blake, became, a, student, at, the, royal, academy, in, old, somerset, house, near, the, strand, while, the, terms, of, his, study, required, no, payment, he, was, expected, to, supply, his, own, materials, throughout, the, six, year, period, there, he, rebelled, against, what, he, regarded, as, the, unfinished, style, of, fashionable, painters, such, as, rubens, championed, by, the, school, s, first, president, joshua, reynolds, over, time, blake, came, to, detest, reynolds, attitude, towards, art, especially, his, pursuit, of, general, truth, and, general, beauty, reynolds, wrote, in, his, discourses, that, the, disposition, to, abstractions, to, generalising, and, classification, is, the, great, glory, of, the, human, mind, blake, responded, in, marginalia, to, his, personal, copy, that, to, generalize, is, to, be, an, idiot, to, particularize, is, the, alone, distinction, of, merit, blake, also, disliked, reynolds, apparent, humility, which, he, held, to, be, a, form, of, hypocrisy, against, reynolds, fashionable, oil, painting, blake, preferred, the, classical, precision, of, his, early, influences, michelangelo, and, raphael, david, bindman, suggests, that, blake, s, antagonism, towards, reynolds, arose, not, so, much, from, the, president, s, opinions, like, blake, reynolds, held, history, painting, to, be, of, greater, value, than, landscape, and, portraiture, but, rather, against, his, hypocrisy, in, not, putting, his, ideals, into, practice, certainly, blake, was, not, averse, to, exhibiting, at, the, royal, academy, submitting, works, on, six, occasions, between, 1780, and, 1808, blake, became, a, friend, of, john, flaxman, thomas, stothard, and, george, cumberland, during, his, first, year, at, the, royal, academy, they, shared, radical, views, with, stothard, and, cumberland, joining, the, society, for, constitutional, information, blake, s, first, biographer, alexander, gilchrist, records, that, in, june, 1780, blake, was, walking, towards, basire, s, shop, in, great, queen, street, when, he, was, swept, up, by, a, rampaging, mob, that, stormed, newgate, prison, the, mob, attacked, the, prison, gates, with, shovels, and, pickaxes, set, the, building, ablaze, and, released, the, prisoners, inside, blake, was, reportedly, in, the, front, rank, of, the, mob, during, the, attack, the, riots, in, response, to, a, parliamentary, bill, revoking, sanctions, against, roman, catholicism, became, known, as, the, gordon, riots, and, provoked, a, flurry, of, legislation, from, the, government, of, george, iii, and, the, creation, of, the, first, police, force, in, 1781, william, met, catherine, boucher, when, he, was, recovering, from, a, relationship, that, had, culminated, in, a, refusal, of, his, marriage, proposal, he, recounted, the, story, of, his, heartbreak, for, catherine, and, her, parents, after, which, he, asked, catherine, do, you, pity, me, when, she, responded, affirmatively, he, declared, then, i, love, you, william, married, catherine, who, was, five, years, his, junior, on, 18, august, 1782, in, st, mary, s, church, battersea, illiterate, catherine, signed, her, wedding, contract, with, an, x, the, original, wedding, certificate, may, be, viewed, at, the, church, where, a, commemorative, stained, glass, window, was, installed, between, 1976, and, 1982, the, marriage, was, successful, and, catherine, became, william, s, partner, in, both, life, and, work, undertaking, important, roles, as, an, engraver, and, colourist, according, to, the, tate, gallery, catherine, mixed, and, applied, his, paint, colors, one, of, catherine, blake, s, most, noted, works, is, the, coloring, of, the, cover, of, the, book, europe, a, prophecy, william, blake, s, 1863, biographer, alexander, gilchrist, wrote, the, poet, and, his, wife, did, everything, in, making, the, book, writing, designing, printing, engraving, everything, except, manufacturing, the, paper, the, very, ink, or, colour, rather, they, did, make, in, 2019, tate, britain, s, blake, exhibition, gave, particular, focus, to, catherine, boucher, s, role, in, william, blake, s, work, around, 1783, blake, s, first, collection, of, poems, poetical, sketches, was, printed, in, 1784, after, his, father, s, death, blake, and, former, fellow, apprentice, james, parker, opened, a, print, shop, they, began, working, with, radical, publisher, joseph, johnson, johnson, s, house, was, a, meeting, place, for, some, leading, english, intellectual, dissidents, of, the, time, theologian, and, scientist, joseph, priestley, philosopher, richard, price, artist, john, henry, fuseli, early, feminist, mary, wollstonecraft, and, english, american, revolutionary, thomas, paine, along, with, william, wordsworth, and, william, godwin, blake, had, great, hopes, for, the, french, and, american, revolutions, and, wore, a, phrygian, cap, in, solidarity, with, the, french, revolutionaries, but, despaired, with, the, rise, of, robespierre, and, the, reign, of, terror, in, france, that, same, year, blake, composed, his, unfinished, manuscript, an, island, in, the, moon, 1784, blake, illustrated, original, stories, from, real, life, 2nd, edition, 1791, by, mary, wollstonecraft, although, they, seem, to, have, shared, some, views, on, sexual, equality, and, the, institution, of, marriage, no, evidence, is, known, that, would, prove, that, they, had, met, in, visions, of, the, daughters, of, albion, 1793, blake, condemned, the, cruel, absurdity, of, enforced, chastity, and, marriage, without, love, and, defended, the, right, of, women, to, complete, self, fulfilment, from, 1790, to, 1800, william, blake, lived, in, north, lambeth, london, at, 13, hercules, buildings, hercules, road, the, property, was, demolished, in, 1918, but, the, site, is, marked, with, a, plaque, a, series, of, 70, mosaics, commemorates, blake, in, the, nearby, railway, tunnels, of, waterloo, station, the, mosaics, largely, reproduce, illustrations, from, blake, s, illuminated, books, the, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, the, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, and, the, prophetic, books, in, 1788, aged, 31, blake, experimented, with, relief, etching, a, method, he, used, to, produce, most, of, his, books, paintings, pamphlets, and, poems, the, process, is, also, referred, to, as, illuminated, printing, and, the, finished, products, as, illuminated, books, or, prints, illuminated, printing, involved, writing, the, text, of, the, poems, on, copper, plates, with, pens, and, brushes, using, an, acid, resistant, medium, illustrations, could, appear, alongside, words, in, the, manner, of, earlier, illuminated, manuscripts, he, then, etched, the, plates, in, acid, to, dissolve, the, untreated, copper, and, leave, the, design, standing, in, relief, hence, the, name, this, is, a, reversal, of, the, usual, method, of, etching, where, the, lines, of, the, design, are, exposed, to, the, acid, and, the, plate, printed, by, the, intaglio, method, relief, etching, which, blake, referred, to, as, stereotype, in, the, ghost, of, abel, was, intended, as, a, means, for, producing, his, illuminated, books, more, quickly, than, via, intaglio, stereotype, a, process, invented, in, 1725, consisted, of, making, a, metal, cast, from, a, wood, engraving, but, blake, s, innovation, was, as, described, above, very, different, the, pages, printed, from, these, plates, were, hand, coloured, in, watercolours, and, stitched, together, to, form, a, volume, blake, used, illuminated, printing, for, most, of, his, well, known, works, including, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, the, book, of, thel, the, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, and, jerusalem, although, blake, has, become, better, known, for, his, relief, etching, his, commercial, work, largely, consisted, of, intaglio, engraving, the, standard, process, of, engraving, in, the, 18th, century, in, which, the, artist, incised, an, image, into, the, copper, plate, a, complex, and, laborious, process, with, plates, taking, months, or, years, to, complete, but, as, blake, s, contemporary, john, boydell, realised, such, engraving, offered, a, missing, link, with, commerce, enabling, artists, to, connect, with, a, mass, audience, and, became, an, immensely, important, activity, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, europe, supported, by, africa, and, america, is, an, engraving, by, blake, held, in, the, collection, of, the, university, of, arizona, museum, of, art, the, engraving, was, for, a, book, written, by, blake, s, friend, john, gabriel, stedman, called, the, narrative, of, a, five, years, expedition, against, the, revolted, negroes, of, surinam, 1796, it, depicts, three, women, embracing, one, another, black, africa, and, white, europe, hold, hands, in, a, gesture, of, equality, as, the, barren, earth, blooms, beneath, their, feet, europe, wears, a, string, of, pearls, while, her, sisters, africa, and, america, are, depicted, wearing, slave, bracelets, some, scholars, have, speculated, that, the, bracelets, represent, the, historical, fact, of, slavery, in, africa, and, the, americas, while, the, handclasp, refer, to, stedman, s, ardent, wish, we, only, differ, in, color, but, are, certainly, all, created, by, the, same, hand, others, have, said, it, expresses, the, climate, of, opinion, in, which, the, questions, of, color, and, slavery, were, at, that, time, being, considered, and, which, blake, s, writings, reflect, blake, employed, intaglio, engraving, in, his, own, work, such, as, for, his, illustrations, of, the, book, of, job, completed, just, before, his, death, most, critical, work, has, concentrated, on, blake, s, relief, etching, as, a, technique, because, it, is, the, most, innovative, aspect, of, his, art, but, a, 2009, study, drew, attention, to, blake, s, surviving, plates, including, those, for, the, book, of, job, they, demonstrate, that, he, made, frequent, use, of, a, technique, known, as, repoussage, a, means, of, obliterating, mistakes, by, hammering, them, out, by, hitting, the, back, of, the, plate, such, techniques, typical, of, engraving, work, of, the, time, are, very, different, from, the, much, faster, and, fluid, way, of, drawing, on, a, plate, that, blake, employed, for, his, relief, etching, and, indicates, why, the, engravings, took, so, long, to, complete, blake, s, marriage, to, catherine, was, close, and, devoted, until, his, death, blake, taught, catherine, to, write, and, she, helped, him, colour, his, printed, poems, gilchrist, refers, to, stormy, times, in, the, early, years, of, the, marriage, some, biographers, have, suggested, that, blake, tried, to, bring, a, concubine, into, the, marriage, bed, in, accordance, with, the, beliefs, of, the, more, radical, branches, of, the, swedenborgian, society, but, other, scholars, have, dismissed, these, theories, as, conjecture, in, his, dictionary, samuel, foster, damon, suggests, that, catherine, may, have, had, a, stillborn, daughter, for, which, the, book, of, thel, is, an, elegy, that, is, how, he, rationalizes, the, book, s, unusual, ending, but, notes, that, he, is, speculating, in, 1800, blake, moved, to, a, cottage, at, felpham, in, sussex, now, west, sussex, to, take, up, a, job, illustrating, the, works, of, william, hayley, a, minor, poet, it, was, in, this, cottage, that, blake, began, milton, the, title, page, is, dated, 1804, but, blake, continued, to, work, on, it, until, 1808, the, preface, to, this, work, includes, a, poem, beginning, and, did, those, feet, in, ancient, time, which, became, the, words, for, the, anthem, jerusalem, over, time, blake, began, to, resent, his, new, patron, believing, that, hayley, was, uninterested, in, true, artistry, and, preoccupied, with, the, meer, drudgery, of, business, e724, blake, s, disenchantment, with, hayley, has, been, speculated, to, have, influenced, milton, a, poem, in, which, blake, wrote, that, corporeal, friends, are, spiritual, enemies, 4, 26, e98, blake, s, trouble, with, authority, came, to, a, head, in, august, 1803, when, he, was, involved, in, a, physical, altercation, with, a, soldier, john, schofield, blake, was, charged, not, only, with, assault, but, with, uttering, seditious, and, treasonable, expressions, against, the, king, schofield, claimed, that, blake, had, exclaimed, damn, the, king, the, soldiers, are, all, slaves, blake, was, cleared, in, the, chichester, assizes, of, the, charges, according, to, a, report, in, the, sussex, county, paper, he, invented, character, of, was, so, obvious, that, an, acquittal, resulted, schofield, was, later, depicted, wearing, mind, forged, manacles, in, an, illustration, to, jerusalem, the, emanation, of, the, giant, albion, blake, returned, to, london, in, 1804, and, began, to, write, and, illustrate, jerusalem, 1804, 20, his, most, ambitious, work, having, conceived, the, idea, of, portraying, the, characters, in, chaucer, s, canterbury, tales, blake, approached, the, dealer, robert, cromek, with, a, view, to, marketing, an, engraving, knowing, blake, was, too, eccentric, to, produce, a, popular, work, cromek, promptly, commissioned, blake, s, friend, thomas, stothard, to, execute, the, concept, when, blake, learned, he, had, been, cheated, he, broke, off, contact, with, stothard, he, set, up, an, independent, exhibition, in, his, brother, s, haberdashery, shop, at, 27, broad, street, in, soho, the, exhibition, was, designed, to, market, his, own, version, of, the, canterbury, illustration, titled, the, canterbury, pilgrims, along, with, other, works, as, a, result, he, wrote, his, descriptive, catalogue, 1809, which, contains, what, anthony, blunt, called, a, brilliant, analysis, of, chaucer, and, is, regularly, anthologised, as, a, classic, of, chaucer, criticism, it, also, contained, detailed, explanations, of, his, other, paintings, the, exhibition, was, very, poorly, attended, selling, none, of, the, temperas, or, watercolours, its, only, review, in, the, examiner, was, hostile, also, around, this, time, circa, 1808, blake, gave, vigorous, expression, of, his, views, on, art, in, an, extensive, series, of, polemical, annotations, to, the, discourses, of, sir, joshua, reynolds, denouncing, the, royal, academy, as, a, fraud, and, proclaiming, to, generalize, is, to, be, an, idiot, in, 1818, he, was, introduced, by, george, cumberland, s, son, to, a, young, artist, named, john, linnell, a, blue, plaque, commemorates, blake, and, linnell, at, old, wyldes, at, north, end, hampstead, through, linnell, he, met, samuel, palmer, who, belonged, to, a, group, of, artists, who, called, themselves, the, shoreham, ancients, the, group, shared, blake, s, rejection, of, modern, trends, and, his, belief, in, a, spiritual, and, artistic, new, age, aged, 65, blake, began, work, on, illustrations, for, the, book, of, job, later, admired, by, ruskin, who, compared, blake, favourably, to, rembrandt, and, by, vaughan, williams, who, based, his, ballet, job, a, masque, for, dancing, on, a, selection, of, the, illustrations, in, later, life, blake, began, to, sell, a, great, number, of, his, works, particularly, his, bible, illustrations, to, thomas, butts, a, patron, who, saw, blake, more, as, a, friend, than, a, man, whose, work, held, artistic, merit, this, was, typical, of, the, opinions, held, of, blake, throughout, his, life, the, commission, for, dante, s, divine, comedy, came, to, blake, in, 1826, through, linnell, with, the, aim, of, producing, a, series, of, engravings, blake, s, death, in, 1827, cut, short, the, enterprise, and, only, a, handful, of, watercolours, were, completed, with, only, seven, of, the, engravings, arriving, at, proof, form, even, so, they, have, earned, praise, he, dante, watercolours, are, among, blake, s, richest, achievements, engaging, fully, with, the, problem, of, illustrating, a, poem, of, this, complexity, the, mastery, of, watercolour, has, reached, an, even, higher, level, than, before, and, is, used, to, extraordinary, effect, in, differentiating, the, atmosphere, of, the, three, states, of, being, in, the, poem, blake, s, illustrations, of, the, poem, are, not, merely, accompanying, works, but, rather, seem, to, critically, revise, or, furnish, commentary, on, certain, spiritual, or, moral, aspects, of, the, text, because, the, project, was, never, completed, blake, s, intent, may, be, obscured, some, indicators, bolster, the, impression, that, blake, s, illustrations, in, their, totality, would, take, issue, with, the, text, they, accompany, in, the, margin, of, homer, bearing, the, sword, and, his, companions, blake, notes, every, thing, in, dantes, comedia, shews, that, for, tyrannical, purposes, he, has, made, this, world, the, foundation, of, all, the, goddess, nature, not, the, holy, ghost, blake, seems, to, dissent, from, dante, s, admiration, of, the, poetic, works, of, ancient, greece, and, from, the, apparent, glee, with, which, dante, allots, punishments, in, hell, as, evidenced, by, the, grim, humour, of, the, cantos, at, the, same, time, blake, shared, dante, s, distrust, of, materialism, and, the, corruptive, nature, of, power, and, clearly, relished, the, opportunity, to, represent, the, atmosphere, and, imagery, of, dante, s, work, pictorially, even, as, he, seemed, to, be, near, death, blake, s, central, preoccupation, was, his, feverish, work, on, the, illustrations, to, dante, s, inferno, he, is, said, to, have, spent, one, of, the, last, shillings, he, possessed, on, a, pencil, to, continue, sketching, blake, s, last, years, were, spent, at, fountain, court, off, the, strand, the, property, was, demolished, in, the, 1880s, when, the, savoy, hotel, was, built, on, the, day, of, his, death, 12, august, 1827, blake, worked, relentlessly, on, his, dante, series, eventually, it, is, reported, he, ceased, working, and, turned, to, his, wife, who, was, in, tears, by, his, bedside, beholding, her, blake, is, said, to, have, cried, stay, kate, keep, just, as, you, are, i, will, draw, your, portrait, for, you, have, ever, been, an, angel, to, me, having, completed, this, portrait, now, lost, blake, laid, down, his, tools, and, began, to, sing, hymns, and, verses, at, six, that, evening, after, promising, his, wife, that, he, would, be, with, her, always, blake, died, gilchrist, reports, that, a, female, lodger, in, the, house, present, at, his, expiration, said, i, have, been, at, the, death, not, of, a, man, but, of, a, blessed, angel, george, richmond, gives, the, following, account, of, blake, s, death, in, a, letter, to, samuel, palmer, he, died, in, a, most, glorious, manner, he, said, he, was, going, to, that, country, he, had, all, his, life, wished, to, see, expressed, himself, happy, hoping, for, salvation, through, jesus, christ, just, before, he, died, his, countenance, became, fair, his, eyes, brighten, d, and, he, burst, out, singing, of, the, things, he, saw, in, heaven, catherine, paid, for, blake, s, funeral, with, money, lent, to, her, by, linnell, blake, s, body, was, buried, in, a, plot, shared, with, others, five, days, after, his, death, on, the, eve, of, his, 45th, wedding, anniversary, at, the, dissenter, s, burial, ground, in, bunhill, fields, that, became, the, london, borough, of, islington, his, parents, bodies, were, buried, in, the, same, graveyard, present, at, the, ceremonies, were, catherine, edward, calvert, george, richmond, frederick, tatham, and, john, linnell, following, blake, s, death, catherine, moved, into, tatham, s, house, as, a, housekeeper, she, believed, she, was, regularly, visited, by, blake, s, spirit, she, continued, selling, his, illuminated, works, and, paintings, but, entertained, no, business, transaction, without, first, consulting, mr, blake, on, the, day, of, her, death, in, october, 1831, she, was, as, calm, and, cheerful, as, her, husband, and, called, out, to, him, as, if, he, were, only, in, the, next, room, to, say, she, was, coming, to, him, and, it, would, not, be, long, now, on, her, death, longtime, acquaintance, frederick, tatham, took, possession, of, blake, s, works, and, continued, selling, them, tatham, later, joined, the, fundamentalist, irvingite, church, and, under, the, influence, of, conservative, members, of, that, church, burned, manuscripts, that, he, deemed, heretical, the, exact, number, of, destroyed, manuscripts, is, unknown, but, shortly, before, his, death, blake, told, a, friend, he, had, written, twenty, tragedies, as, long, as, macbeth, none, of, which, survive, another, acquaintance, william, michael, rossetti, also, burned, works, by, blake, that, he, considered, lacking, in, quality, and, john, linnell, erased, sexual, imagery, from, a, number, of, blake, s, drawings, at, the, same, time, some, works, not, intended, for, publication, were, preserved, by, friends, such, as, his, notebook, and, an, island, in, the, moon, blake, s, grave, is, commemorated, by, two, stones, the, first, was, a, stone, that, reads, near, by, lie, the, remains, of, the, poet, painter, william, blake, 1757, 1827, and, his, wife, catherine, sophia, 1762, 1831, the, memorial, stone, is, situated, approximately, 20, metres, 66, ft, away, from, the, actual, grave, which, was, not, marked, until, 12, august, 2018, for, years, since, 1965, the, exact, location, of, william, blake, s, grave, had, been, lost, and, forgotten, the, area, had, been, damaged, in, the, second, world, war, gravestones, were, removed, and, a, garden, was, created, the, memorial, stone, indicating, that, the, burial, sites, are, nearby, was, listed, as, a, grade, ii, listed, structure, in, 2011, a, portuguese, couple, carol, and, lu, s, garrido, rediscovered, the, exact, burial, location, after, 14, years, of, investigatory, work, and, the, blake, society, organised, a, permanent, memorial, slab, which, was, unveiled, at, a, public, ceremony, at, the, site, on, 12, august, 2018, the, new, stone, is, inscribed, here, lies, william, blake, 1757, 1827, poet, artist, prophet, above, a, verse, from, his, poem, jerusalem, the, blake, prize, for, religious, art, was, established, in, his, honour, in, australia, in, 1949, in, 1957, a, memorial, to, blake, and, his, wife, was, erected, in, westminster, abbey, another, memorial, lies, in, st, james, s, church, piccadilly, where, he, was, baptised, at, the, time, of, blake, s, death, he, had, sold, fewer, than, 30, copies, of, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, blake, was, not, active, in, any, well, established, political, party, his, poetry, consistently, embodies, an, attitude, of, rebellion, against, the, abuse, of, class, power, as, documented, in, david, erdman, s, major, study, blake, prophet, against, empire, a, poet, s, interpretation, of, the, history, of, his, own, times, 1954, blake, was, concerned, about, senseless, wars, and, the, blighting, effects, of, the, industrial, revolution, much, of, his, poetry, recounts, in, symbolic, allegory, the, effects, of, the, french, and, american, revolutions, erdman, claims, blake, was, disillusioned, with, the, political, outcomes, of, the, conflicts, believing, they, had, simply, replaced, monarchy, with, irresponsible, mercantilism, erdman, also, notes, blake, was, deeply, opposed, to, slavery, and, believes, some, of, his, poems, read, primarily, as, championing, free, love, had, their, anti, slavery, implications, short, changed, a, more, recent, study, william, blake, visionary, anarchist, by, peter, marshall, 1988, classified, blake, and, his, contemporary, william, godwin, as, forerunners, of, modern, anarchism, british, marxist, historian, e, p, thompson, s, last, finished, work, witness, against, the, beast, william, blake, and, the, moral, law, 1993, claims, to, show, how, far, he, was, inspired, by, dissident, religious, ideas, rooted, in, the, thinking, of, the, most, radical, opponents, of, the, monarchy, during, the, english, civil, war, because, blake, s, later, poetry, contains, a, private, mythology, with, complex, symbolism, his, late, work, has, been, less, published, than, his, earlier, more, accessible, work, the, vintage, anthology, of, blake, edited, by, patti, smith, focuses, heavily, on, the, earlier, work, as, do, many, critical, studies, such, as, william, blake, by, d, g, gillham, the, earlier, work, is, primarily, rebellious, in, character, and, can, be, seen, as, a, protest, against, dogmatic, religion, especially, notable, in, the, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, in, which, the, figure, represented, by, the, devil, is, virtually, a, hero, rebelling, against, an, imposter, authoritarian, deity, in, later, works, such, as, milton, and, jerusalem, blake, carves, a, distinctive, vision, of, a, humanity, redeemed, by, self, sacrifice, and, forgiveness, while, retaining, his, earlier, negative, attitude, towards, what, he, felt, was, the, rigid, and, morbid, authoritarianism, of, traditional, religion, not, all, readers, of, blake, agree, upon, how, much, continuity, exists, between, blake, s, earlier, and, later, works, psychoanalyst, june, singer, has, written, that, blake, s, late, work, displayed, a, development, of, the, ideas, first, introduced, in, his, earlier, works, namely, the, humanitarian, goal, of, achieving, personal, wholeness, of, body, and, spirit, the, final, section, of, the, expanded, edition, of, her, blake, study, the, unholy, bible, suggests, the, later, works, are, the, bible, of, hell, promised, in, the, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, regarding, blake, s, final, poem, jerusalem, she, writes, the, promise, of, the, divine, in, man, made, in, the, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, is, at, last, fulfilled, john, middleton, murry, notes, discontinuity, between, marriage, and, the, late, works, in, that, while, the, early, blake, focused, on, a, sheer, negative, opposition, between, energy, and, reason, the, later, blake, emphasised, the, notions, of, self, sacrifice, and, forgiveness, as, the, road, to, interior, wholeness, this, renunciation, of, the, sharper, dualism, of, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, is, evidenced, in, particular, by, the, humanisation, of, the, character, of, urizen, in, the, later, works, murry, characterises, the, later, blake, as, having, found, mutual, understanding, and, mutual, forgiveness, regarding, conventional, religion, blake, was, a, satirist, and, ironist, in, his, viewpoints, which, are, illustrated, and, summarized, in, his, poem, vala, or, the, four, zoas, one, of, his, uncompleted, prophetic, books, begun, in, 1797, the, demi, mythological, and, demi, religious, main, characters, of, the, book, are, the, four, zoas, urthona, urizen, luvah, and, tharmas, who, were, created, by, the, fall, of, albion, in, blake, s, mythology, it, consists, of, nine, books, referred, to, as, nights, these, outline, the, interactions, of, the, zoas, their, fallen, forms, and, their, emanations, blake, intended, the, book, to, be, a, summation, of, his, mythic, universe, blake, s, four, zoas, which, represent, four, aspects, of, the, almighty, god, and, vala, is, the, first, work, to, mention, them, in, particular, blake, s, god, man, union, is, broken, down, into, the, bodily, components, of, urizen, head, urthona, loins, luvah, heart, and, tharmas, unity, of, the, body, with, paired, emanations, being, ahania, wisdom, from, the, head, enitharmon, what, can, t, be, attained, in, nature, from, the, loins, vala, nature, from, the, heart, and, enion, earth, mother, from, the, separation, of, unity, as, connected, to, blake, s, understanding, of, the, divine, the, zoas, are, the, god, the, father, tharmas, sense, the, son, of, god, luvah, love, the, holy, ghost, urthona, imagination, and, satan, who, was, originally, of, the, divine, substance, urizen, reason, and, their, emanations, represent, sexual, urges, enion, nature, vala, inspiration, enitharmon, and, pleasure, ahania, blake, believed, that, each, person, had, a, twofold, identity, with, one, half, being, good, and, the, other, evil, in, vala, both, the, character, orc, and, the, eternal, man, discuss, their, selves, as, divided, by, the, time, he, was, working, on, his, later, works, including, vala, blake, felt, that, he, was, able, to, overcome, his, inner, battle, but, he, was, concerned, about, losing, his, artistic, abilities, these, thoughts, carried, over, into, vala, as, the, character, los, imagination, is, connected, to, the, image, of, christ, and, he, added, a, christian, element, to, his, mythic, world, in, the, revised, version, of, vala, blake, added, christian, and, hebrew, images, and, describes, how, los, experiences, a, vision, of, the, lamb, of, god, that, regenerates, los, s, spirit, in, opposition, to, christ, is, urizen, and, the, synagogue, of, satan, who, later, crucifies, christ, it, is, from, them, that, deism, is, born, blake, did, not, subscribe, to, the, notion, of, a, body, distinct, from, the, soul, that, must, submit, to, the, rule, of, the, soul, but, sees, the, body, as, an, extension, of, the, soul, derived, from, the, discernment, of, the, senses, thus, the, emphasis, orthodoxy, places, upon, the, denial, of, bodily, urges, is, a, dualistic, error, born, of, misapprehension, of, the, relationship, between, body, and, soul, elsewhere, he, describes, satan, as, the, state, of, error, and, as, beyond, salvation, blake, opposed, the, sophistry, of, theological, thought, that, excuses, pain, admits, evil, and, apologises, for, injustice, he, abhorred, self, denial, which, he, associated, with, religious, repression, and, particularly, sexual, repression, prudence, is, a, rich, ugly, old, maid, courted, by, incapacity, he, who, desires, but, acts, not, breeds, pestilence, 7, 4, 5, e35, he, saw, the, concept, of, sin, as, a, trap, to, bind, men, s, desires, the, briars, of, garden, of, love, and, believed, that, restraint, in, obedience, to, a, moral, code, imposed, from, the, outside, was, against, the, spirit, of, life, abstinence, sows, sand, all, over, the, ruddy, limbs, flaming, hair, but, desire, gratified, plants, fruits, beauty, there, e474, he, did, not, hold, with, the, doctrine, of, god, as, lord, an, entity, separate, from, and, superior, to, mankind, this, is, shown, clearly, in, his, words, about, jesus, christ, he, is, the, only, god, and, so, am, i, and, so, are, you, a, telling, phrase, in, the, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, is, men, forgot, that, all, deities, reside, in, the, human, breast, blake, had, a, complex, relationship, with, enlightenment, philosophy, his, championing, of, the, imagination, as, the, most, important, element, of, human, existence, ran, contrary, to, enlightenment, ideals, of, rationalism, and, empiricism, due, to, his, visionary, religious, beliefs, he, opposed, the, newtonian, view, of, the, universe, this, mindset, is, reflected, in, an, excerpt, from, blake, s, jerusalem, i, turn, my, eyes, to, the, schools, universities, of, europe, and, there, behold, the, loom, of, locke, whose, woof, rages, dire, washd, by, the, water, wheels, of, newton, black, the, cloth, in, heavy, wreathes, folds, over, every, nation, cruel, works, of, many, wheels, i, view, wheel, without, wheel, with, cogs, tyrannic, moving, by, compulsion, each, other, not, as, those, in, eden, which, wheel, within, wheel, in, freedom, revolve, in, harmony, peace, 15, 14, 20, e159, blake, believed, the, paintings, of, sir, joshua, reynolds, which, depict, the, naturalistic, fall, of, light, upon, objects, were, products, entirely, of, the, vegetative, eye, and, he, saw, locke, and, newton, as, the, true, progenitors, of, sir, joshua, reynolds, aesthetic, the, popular, taste, in, the, england, of, that, time, for, such, paintings, was, satisfied, with, mezzotints, prints, produced, by, a, process, that, created, an, image, from, thousands, of, tiny, dots, upon, the, page, blake, saw, an, analogy, between, this, and, newton, s, particle, theory, of, light, accordingly, blake, never, used, the, technique, opting, rather, to, develop, a, method, of, engraving, purely, in, fluid, line, insisting, that, a, line, or, lineament, is, not, formed, by, chance, a, line, is, a, line, in, its, minutest, subdivision, strait, or, crooked, it, is, itself, not, intermeasurable, with, or, by, any, thing, else, such, is, job, e784, it, has, been, supposed, that, despite, his, opposition, to, enlightenment, principles, blake, arrived, at, a, linear, aesthetic, that, was, in, many, ways, more, similar, to, the, neoclassical, engravings, of, john, flaxman, than, to, the, works, of, the, romantics, with, whom, he, is, often, classified, however, blake, s, relationship, with, flaxman, seems, to, have, grown, more, distant, after, blake, s, return, from, felpham, and, there, are, surviving, letters, between, flaxman, and, hayley, wherein, flaxman, speaks, ill, of, blake, s, theories, of, art, blake, further, criticized, flaxman, s, styles, and, theories, of, art, in, his, responses, to, criticism, made, against, his, print, of, chaucer, s, caunterbury, pilgrims, in, 1810, since, his, death, blake, has, been, claimed, by, those, of, various, movements, who, apply, his, complex, and, often, elusive, use, of, symbolism, and, allegory, to, the, issues, that, concern, them, in, particular, blake, is, sometimes, considered, along, with, mary, wollstonecraft, and, her, husband, william, godwin, a, forerunner, of, the, 19th, century, free, love, movement, a, broad, reform, tradition, starting, in, the, 1820s, that, held, that, marriage, is, slavery, and, advocated, the, removal, of, all, state, restrictions, on, sexual, activity, such, as, homosexuality, prostitution, and, adultery, culminating, in, the, birth, control, movement, of, the, early, 20th, century, blake, scholarship, was, more, focused, on, this, theme, in, the, earlier, 20th, century, although, it, is, still, mentioned, by, the, blake, scholar, magnus, ankarsj, who, moderately, challenges, this, interpretation, the, 19th, century, free, love, movement, was, not, particularly, focused, on, the, idea, of, multiple, partners, but, did, agree, with, wollstonecraft, that, state, sanctioned, marriage, was, legal, prostitution, and, monopolistic, in, character, it, has, somewhat, more, in, common, with, early, feminist, movements, particularly, with, regard, to, the, writings, of, mary, wollstonecraft, whom, blake, admired, blake, was, critical, of, the, marriage, laws, of, his, day, and, generally, railed, against, traditional, christian, notions, of, chastity, as, a, virtue, at, a, time, of, tremendous, strain, in, his, marriage, in, part, due, to, catherine, s, apparent, inability, to, bear, children, he, directly, advocated, bringing, a, second, wife, into, the, house, his, poetry, suggests, that, external, demands, for, marital, fidelity, reduce, love, to, mere, duty, rather, than, authentic, affection, and, decries, jealousy, and, egotism, as, a, motive, for, marriage, laws, poems, such, as, why, should, i, be, bound, to, thee, o, my, lovely, myrtle, tree, and, earth, s, answer, seem, to, advocate, multiple, sexual, partners, in, his, poem, london, he, speaks, of, the, marriage, hearse, plagued, by, the, youthful, harlot, s, curse, the, result, alternately, of, false, prudence, and, or, harlotry, visions, of, the, daughters, of, albion, is, widely, though, not, universally, read, as, a, tribute, to, free, love, since, the, relationship, between, bromion, and, oothoon, is, held, together, only, by, laws, and, not, by, love, for, blake, law, and, love, are, opposed, and, he, castigates, the, frozen, marriage, bed, in, visions, blake, writes, till, she, who, burns, with, youth, and, knows, no, fixed, lot, is, bound, in, spells, of, law, to, one, she, loathes, and, must, she, drag, the, chain, of, life, in, weary, lust, 5, 21, 3, e49, in, the, 19th, century, poet, and, free, love, advocate, algernon, charles, swinburne, wrote, a, book, on, blake, drawing, attention, to, the, above, motifs, in, which, blake, praises, sacred, natural, love, that, is, not, bound, by, another, s, possessive, jealousy, the, latter, characterised, by, blake, as, a, creeping, skeleton, swinburne, notes, how, blake, s, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, condemns, the, hypocrisy, of, the, pale, religious, letchery, of, advocates, of, traditional, norms, another, 19th, century, free, love, advocate, edward, carpenter, 1844, 1929, was, influenced, by, blake, s, mystical, emphasis, on, energy, free, from, external, restrictions, in, the, early, 20th, century, pierre, berger, described, how, blake, s, views, echo, mary, wollstonecraft, s, celebration, of, joyful, authentic, love, rather, than, love, born, of, duty, the, former, being, the, true, measure, of, purity, irene, langridge, notes, that, in, blake, s, mysterious, and, unorthodox, creed, the, doctrine, of, free, love, was, something, blake, wanted, for, the, edification, of, the, soul, michael, davis, 1977, book, william, blake, a, new, kind, of, man, suggests, that, blake, thought, jealousy, separates, man, from, the, divine, unity, condemning, him, to, a, frozen, death, as, a, theological, writer, blake, has, a, sense, of, human, fallenness, s, foster, damon, noted, that, for, blake, the, major, impediments, to, a, free, love, society, were, corrupt, human, nature, not, merely, the, intolerance, of, society, and, the, jealousy, of, men, but, the, inauthentic, hypocritical, nature, of, human, communication, thomas, wright, s, 1928, book, life, of, william, blake, entirely, devoted, to, blake, s, doctrine, of, free, love, notes, that, blake, thinks, marriage, should, in, practice, afford, the, joy, of, love, but, notes, that, in, reality, it, often, does, not, as, a, couple, s, knowledge, of, being, chained, often, diminishes, their, joy, pierre, berger, also, analyses, blake, s, early, mythological, poems, such, as, ahania, as, declaring, marriage, laws, to, be, a, consequence, of, the, fallenness, of, humanity, as, these, are, born, from, pride, and, jealousy, some, scholars, have, noted, that, blake, s, views, on, free, love, are, both, qualified, and, may, have, undergone, shifts, and, modifications, in, his, late, years, some, poems, from, this, period, warn, of, dangers, of, predatory, sexuality, such, as, the, sick, rose, magnus, ankarsj, notes, that, while, the, hero, of, visions, of, the, daughters, of, albion, is, a, strong, advocate, of, free, love, by, the, end, of, the, poem, she, has, become, more, circumspect, as, her, awareness, of, the, dark, side, of, sexuality, has, grown, crying, can, this, be, love, which, drinks, another, as, a, sponge, drinks, water, ankarsj, also, notes, that, a, major, inspiration, to, blake, mary, wollstonecraft, similarly, developed, more, circumspect, views, of, sexual, freedom, late, in, life, in, light, of, blake, s, aforementioned, sense, of, human, fallenness, ankarsj, thinks, blake, does, not, fully, approve, of, sensual, indulgence, merely, in, defiance, of, law, as, exemplified, by, the, female, character, of, leutha, since, in, the, fallen, world, of, experience, all, love, is, enchained, ankarsj, records, blake, as, having, supported, a, commune, with, some, sharing, of, partners, though, david, worrall, read, the, book, of, thel, as, a, rejection, of, the, proposal, to, take, concubines, espoused, by, some, members, of, the, swedenborgian, church, blake, s, later, writings, show, a, renewed, interest, in, christianity, and, although, he, radically, reinterprets, christian, morality, in, a, way, that, embraces, sensual, pleasure, there, is, little, of, the, emphasis, on, sexual, libertarianism, found, in, several, of, his, early, poems, and, there, is, advocacy, of, self, denial, though, such, abnegation, must, be, inspired, by, love, rather, than, through, authoritarian, compulsion, berger, more, so, than, swinburne, is, especially, sensitive, to, a, shift, in, sensibility, between, the, early, blake, and, the, later, blake, berger, believes, the, young, blake, placed, too, much, emphasis, on, following, impulses, and, that, the, older, blake, had, a, better, formed, ideal, of, a, true, love, that, sacrifices, self, some, celebration, of, mystical, sensuality, remains, in, the, late, poems, most, notably, in, blake, s, denial, of, the, virginity, of, jesus, s, mother, however, the, late, poems, also, place, a, greater, emphasis, on, forgiveness, redemption, and, emotional, authenticity, as, a, foundation, for, relationships, northrop, frye, commenting, on, blake, s, consistency, in, strongly, held, views, notes, that, blake, himself, says, that, his, notes, on, reynolds, written, at, fifty, are, exactly, similar, to, those, on, locke, and, bacon, written, when, he, was, very, young, even, phrases, and, lines, of, verse, will, reappear, as, much, as, forty, years, later, consistency, in, maintaining, what, he, believed, to, be, true, was, itself, one, of, his, leading, principles, consistency, then, foolish, or, otherwise, is, one, of, blake, s, chief, preoccupations, just, as, self, contradiction, is, always, one, of, his, most, contemptuous, comments, blake, abhorred, slavery, and, believed, in, racial, and, sexual, equality, several, of, his, poems, and, paintings, express, a, notion, of, universal, humanity, as, all, men, are, alike, tho, infinitely, various, in, one, poem, narrated, by, a, black, child, white, and, black, bodies, alike, are, described, as, shaded, groves, or, clouds, which, exist, only, until, one, learns, to, bear, the, beams, of, love, when, i, from, black, and, he, from, white, cloud, free, and, round, the, tent, of, god, like, lambs, we, joy, ill, shade, him, from, the, heat, till, he, can, bear, to, lean, in, joy, upon, our, fathers, knee, and, then, i, ll, stand, and, stroke, his, silver, hair, and, be, like, him, and, he, will, then, love, me, 23, 8, e9, blake, retained, an, active, interest, in, social, and, political, events, throughout, his, life, and, social, and, political, statements, are, often, present, in, his, mystical, symbolism, his, views, on, what, he, saw, as, oppression, and, restriction, of, rightful, freedom, extended, to, the, church, his, spiritual, beliefs, are, evident, in, songs, of, experience, 1794, in, which, he, distinguishes, between, the, old, testament, god, whose, restrictions, he, rejected, and, the, new, testament, god, whom, he, saw, as, a, positive, influence, from, a, young, age, william, blake, claimed, to, have, seen, visions, the, first, may, have, occurred, as, early, as, the, age, of, four, when, according, to, one, anecdote, the, young, artist, saw, god, when, god, put, his, head, to, the, window, causing, blake, to, break, into, screaming, at, the, age, of, eight, or, ten, in, peckham, rye, london, blake, claimed, to, have, seen, a, tree, filled, with, angels, bright, angelic, wings, bespangling, every, bough, like, stars, according, to, blake, s, victorian, biographer, gilchrist, he, returned, home, and, reported, the, vision, and, only, escaped, being, thrashed, by, his, father, for, telling, a, lie, through, the, intervention, of, his, mother, though, all, evidence, suggests, that, his, parents, were, largely, supportive, his, mother, seems, to, have, been, especially, so, and, several, of, blake, s, early, drawings, and, poems, decorated, the, walls, of, her, chamber, on, another, occasion, blake, watched, haymakers, at, work, and, thought, he, saw, angelic, figures, walking, among, them, blake, claimed, to, experience, visions, throughout, his, life, they, were, often, associated, with, beautiful, religious, themes, and, imagery, and, may, have, inspired, him, further, with, spiritual, works, and, pursuits, certainly, religious, concepts, and, imagery, figure, centrally, in, blake, s, works, god, and, christianity, constituted, the, intellectual, centre, of, his, writings, from, which, he, drew, inspiration, blake, believed, he, was, personally, instructed, and, encouraged, by, archangels, to, create, his, artistic, works, which, he, claimed, were, actively, read, and, enjoyed, by, the, same, archangels, in, a, letter, of, condolence, to, william, hayley, dated, 6, may, 1800, four, days, after, the, death, of, hayley, s, son, blake, wrote, i, know, that, our, deceased, friends, are, more, really, with, us, than, when, they, were, apparent, to, our, mortal, part, thirteen, years, ago, i, lost, a, brother, and, with, his, spirit, i, converse, daily, and, hourly, in, the, spirit, and, see, him, in, my, remembrance, in, the, region, of, my, imagination, i, hear, his, advice, and, even, now, write, from, his, dictate, in, a, letter, to, john, flaxman, dated, 21, september, 1800, blake, wrote, felpham, is, a, sweet, place, for, study, because, it, is, more, spiritual, than, london, heaven, opens, here, on, all, sides, her, golden, gates, her, windows, are, not, obstructed, by, vapours, voices, of, celestial, inhabitants, are, more, distinctly, heard, their, forms, more, distinctly, seen, my, cottage, is, also, a, shadow, of, their, houses, my, wife, sister, are, both, well, courting, neptune, for, an, embrace, i, am, more, famed, in, heaven, for, my, works, than, i, could, well, conceive, in, my, brain, are, studies, chambers, filled, with, books, pictures, of, old, which, i, wrote, painted, in, ages, of, eternity, before, my, mortal, life, those, works, are, the, delight, study, of, archangels, e710, in, a, letter, to, thomas, butts, dated, 25, april, 1803, blake, wrote, now, i, may, say, to, you, what, perhaps, i, should, not, dare, to, say, to, anyone, else, that, i, can, alone, carry, on, my, visionary, studies, in, london, unannoy, d, that, i, may, converse, with, my, friends, in, eternity, see, visions, dream, dreams, prophecy, speak, parables, unobserv, d, at, liberty, from, the, doubts, of, other, mortals, perhaps, doubts, proceeding, from, kindness, but, doubts, are, always, pernicious, especially, when, we, doubt, our, friends, in, a, vision, of, the, last, judgement, blake, wrote, error, is, created, truth, is, eternal, error, or, creation, will, be, burned, up, then, not, till, then, truth, or, eternity, will, appear, it, is, burnt, up, the, moment, men, cease, to, behold, it, i, assert, for, my, self, that, i, do, not, behold, the, outward, creation, that, to, me, it, is, hindrance, not, action, it, is, as, the, dirt, upon, my, feet, no, part, of, me, what, it, will, be, questiond, when, the, sun, rises, do, you, not, see, a, round, disk, of, fire, somewhat, like, a, guinea, o, no, no, i, see, an, innumerable, company, of, the, heavenly, host, crying, holy, holy, holy, is, the, lord, god, almighty, i, question, not, my, corporeal, or, vegetative, eye, any, more, than, i, would, question, a, window, concerning, a, sight, i, look, thro, it, not, with, it, e565, 6, despite, seeing, angels, and, god, blake, has, also, claimed, to, have, seen, satan, on, the, staircase, of, his, south, molton, street, home, in, london, aware, of, blake, s, visions, william, wordsworth, commented, there, was, no, doubt, that, this, poor, man, was, mad, but, there, is, something, in, the, madness, of, this, man, which, interests, me, more, than, the, sanity, of, lord, byron, and, walter, scott, in, a, more, deferential, vein, john, william, cousins, wrote, in, a, short, biographical, dictionary, of, english, literature, that, blake, was, a, truly, pious, and, loving, soul, neglected, and, misunderstood, by, the, world, but, appreciated, by, an, elect, few, who, led, a, cheerful, and, contented, life, of, poverty, illumined, by, visions, and, celestial, inspirations, blake, s, sanity, was, called, into, question, as, recently, as, the, publication, of, the, 1911, encyclop, dia, britannica, whose, entry, on, blake, comments, that, the, question, whether, blake, was, or, was, not, mad, seems, likely, to, remain, in, dispute, but, there, can, be, no, doubt, whatever, that, he, was, at, different, periods, of, his, life, under, the, influence, of, illusions, for, which, there, are, no, outward, facts, to, account, and, that, much, of, what, he, wrote, is, so, far, wanting, in, the, quality, of, sanity, as, to, be, without, a, logical, coherence, blake, s, work, was, neglected, for, a, generation, after, his, death, and, almost, forgotten, by, the, time, alexander, gilchrist, began, work, on, his, biography, in, the, 1860s, the, publication, of, the, life, of, william, blake, rapidly, transformed, blake, s, reputation, in, particular, as, he, was, taken, up, by, pre, raphaelites, and, associated, figures, in, particular, dante, gabriel, rossetti, and, algernon, charles, swinburne, in, the, 20th, century, however, blake, s, work, was, fully, appreciated, and, his, influence, increased, important, early, and, mid, 20th, century, scholars, involved, in, enhancing, blake, s, standing, in, literary, and, artistic, circles, included, s, foster, damon, geoffrey, keynes, northrop, frye, and, david, v, erdman, while, blake, had, a, significant, role, in, the, art, and, poetry, of, figures, such, as, rossetti, it, was, during, the, modernist, period, that, this, work, began, to, influence, a, wider, set, of, writers, and, artists, william, butler, yeats, who, edited, an, edition, of, blake, s, collected, works, in, 1893, drew, on, him, for, poetic, and, philosophical, ideas, while, british, surrealist, art, in, particular, drew, on, blake, s, conceptions, of, non, mimetic, visionary, practice, in, the, painting, of, artists, such, as, paul, nash, and, graham, sutherland, his, poetry, came, into, use, by, a, number, of, british, classical, composers, who, set, his, works, the, earliest, such, work, known, is, doyne, bell, s, setting, of, the, poem, can, i, see, another, s, woe, from, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, published, in, 1876, notable, settings, are, by, benjamin, britten, and, ralph, vaughan, williams, and, john, tavener, set, several, of, blake, s, poems, including, the, lamb, as, the, 1982, work, the, lamb, and, the, tyger, many, such, as, june, singer, have, argued, that, blake, s, thoughts, on, human, nature, greatly, anticipate, and, parallel, the, thinking, of, the, psychoanalyst, carl, jung, in, jung, s, own, words, blake, a, tantalizing, study, since, he, compiled, a, lot, of, half, or, undigested, knowledge, in, his, fantasies, according, to, my, ideas, they, are, an, artistic, production, rather, than, an, authentic, representation, of, unconscious, processes, similarly, diana, hume, george, claimed, that, blake, can, be, seen, as, a, precursor, to, the, ideas, of, sigmund, freud, blake, had, an, enormous, influence, on, the, beat, poets, of, the, 1950s, and, the, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, frequently, being, cited, by, such, seminal, figures, as, beat, poet, allen, ginsberg, songwriters, bob, dylan, richard, ashcroft, jim, morrison, van, morrison, bruce, dickinson, and, english, writer, aldous, huxley, the, pulitzer, winning, composer, william, bolcom, set, songs, of, innocence, and, of, experience, to, music, with, different, poems, set, to, different, styles, of, music, from, modern, techniques, to, broadway, to, country, western, and, reggae, much, of, the, central, conceit, of, philip, pullman, s, fantasy, trilogy, his, dark, materials, is, rooted, in, the, world, of, blake, s, the, marriage, of, heaven, and, hell, blake, also, features, as, a, relatively, significant, character, in, brian, catling, s, fantasy, novel, the, erstwhile, where, his, visions, of, angelic, beings, are, figured, into, the, story, canadian, music, composer, kathleen, yearwood, is, one, of, many, contemporary, musicians, that, have, set, blake, s, poems, to, music, after, world, war, ii, blake, s, role, in, popular, culture, came, to, the, fore, in, a, variety, of, areas, such, as, popular, music, film, and, the, graphic, novel, leading, edward, larrissy, to, assert, that, blake, is, the, romantic, writer, who, has, exerted, the, most, powerful, influence, on, the, twentieth, century, major, recent, exhibitions, focusing, on, william, blake, include, the, works, with, constitute, the, prophetic, books, digital, editions, and, research, category
