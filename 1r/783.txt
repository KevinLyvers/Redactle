early, age, when, he, was, twelve, sartre, s, mother, remarried, and, the, family, moved, to, la, rochelle, where, he, was, frequently, bullied, in, part, due, to, the, wandering, of, his, blind,

most, decisive, influence, on, sartre, s, philosophical, development, was, his, weekly, attendance, at, alexandre, koj, ve, s, seminars, which, continued, for, a, number, of, years, from, his, first, years, in, the, cole, normale, sartre, was, one, of, its, fiercest, pranksters, in, 1927, his, antimilitarist, satirical, cartoon, in, the, revue, of, the, school, coauthored, with, georges,

later, went, on, to, become, a, noted, philosopher, writer, and, feminist, the, two, became, inseparable, and, lifelong, companions, initiating, a, romantic, relationship, though, they, were, not, monogamous, the, first, time, sartre, took, the, agr, gation, he, failed, he, took, it, a, second, time, and, virtually, tied, for, first, place, with, beauvoir, although, sartre, was, eventually,

allemagne, in, berlin, where, he, studied, edmund, husserl, s, phenomenological, philosophy, aron, had, already, advised, him, in, 1930, to, read, emmanuel, levinas, s, th, orie, de, l, intuition, dans, la, ph, nom, nologie, de, husserl, the, theory, of, intuition, in, husserl, s, phenomenology, the, neo, hegelian, revival, led, by, alexandre, koj, ve, and, jean, hyppolite, in, the, 1930s, inspired, a, whole, generation, of, french, thinkers, including, sartre, to, discover, hegel, s, phenomenology, of, spirit, in, 1939, sartre, was, drafted, into, the, french, army, where, he, served, as, a, meteorologist, he, was, captured, by, german, troops, in, 1940, in, padoux, and, he, spent, nine, months, as, a, prisoner, of, war, in, nancy, and, finally, in, stalag, xii, d, trier, where, he, wrote, his, first, theatrical, piece, barion, fils, du, tonnerre, a, drama, concerning, christmas, it, was, during, this, period, of, confinement, that, sartre, read, martin, heidegger, s, sein, und, zeit, later, to, become, a, major, influence, on, his, own, essay, on, phenomenological, ontology, because, of, poor, health, he, claimed, that, his, poor, eyesight, and, exotropia, affected, his, balance, sartre, was, released, in, april, 1941, according, to, other, sources, he, escaped, after, a, medical, visit, to, the, ophthalmologist, given, civilian, status, he, recovered, his, teaching, position, at, lyc, e, pasteur, near, paris, and, settled, at, the, hotel, mistral, in, october, 1941, he, was, given, a, position, previously, held, by, a, jewish, teacher, who, had, been, forbidden, to, teach, by, vichy, law, at, lyc, e, condorcet, in, paris, after, coming, back, to, paris, in, may, 1941, he, participated, in, the, founding, of, the, underground, group, socialisme, et, libert, socialism, and, liberty, with, other, writers, simone, de, beauvoir, maurice, merleau, ponty, jean, toussaint, desanti, dominique, desanti, jean, kanapa, and, cole, normale, students, in, spring, of, 1941, sartre, suggested, with, cheerful, ferocity, at, a, meeting, that, the, socialisme, et, libert, assassinate, prominent, war, collaborators, like, marcel, d, at, but, de, beauvoir, noted, his, idea, was, rejected, as, none, of, us, felt, qualified, to, make, bombs, or, hurl, grenades, the, british, historian, ian, ousby, observed, that, the, french, always, had, far, more, hatred, for, collaborators, than, they, did, for, the, germans, noting, it, was, french, people, like, d, at, that, sartre, wanted, to, assassinate, rather, than, the, military, governor, of, france, general, otto, von, st, lpnagel, and, the, popular, slogan, always, was, death, to, laval, rather, than, death, to, hitler, in, august, sartre, and, de, beauvoir, went, to, the, french, riviera, seeking, the, support, of, andr, gide, and, andr, malraux, however, both, gide, and, malraux, were, undecided, and, this, may, have, been, the, cause, of, sartre, s, disappointment, and, discouragement, socialisme, et, libert, soon, dissolved, and, sartre, decided, to, write, instead, of, being, involved, in, active, resistance, he, then, wrote, being, and, nothingness, the, flies, and, no, exit, none, of, which, were, censored, by, the, germans, and, also, contributed, to, both, legal, and, illegal, literary, magazines, in, his, essay, paris, under, the, occupation, sartre, wrote, that, the, correct, behaviour, of, the, germans, had, entrapped, too, many, parisians, into, complicity, with, the, occupation, accepting, what, was, unnatural, as, natural, the, germans, did, not, stride, revolver, in, hand, through, the, streets, they, did, not, force, civilians, to, make, way, for, them, on, the, pavement, they, would, offer, seats, to, old, ladies, on, the, metro, they, showed, great, fondness, for, children, and, would, pat, them, on, the, cheek, they, had, been, told, to, behave, correctly, and, being, well, disciplined, they, tried, shyly, and, conscientiously, to, do, so, some, of, them, even, displayed, a, naive, kindness, which, could, find, no, practical, expression, sartre, noted, when, wehrmacht, soldiers, asked, parisians, politely, in, their, german, accented, french, for, directions, people, usually, felt, embarrassed, and, ashamed, as, they, tried, their, best, to, help, out, the, wehrmacht, which, led, sartre, to, remark, we, could, not, be, natural, french, was, a, language, widely, taught, in, german, schools, and, most, germans, could, speak, at, least, some, french, sartre, himself, always, found, it, difficult, when, a, wehrmacht, soldier, asked, him, for, directions, usually, saying, he, did, not, know, where, it, was, that, the, soldier, wanted, to, go, but, still, felt, uncomfortable, as, the, very, act, of, speaking, to, the, wehrmacht, meant, he, had, been, complicit, in, the, occupation, ousby, wrote, but, in, however, humble, a, fashion, everyone, still, had, to, decide, how, they, were, going, to, cope, with, life, in, a, fragmenting, society, so, sartre, s, worries, about, how, to, react, when, a, german, soldier, stopped, him, in, the, street, and, asked, politely, for, directions, were, not, as, fussily, inconsequential, as, they, might, sound, at, first, they, were, emblematic, of, how, the, dilemmas, of, the, occupation, presented, themselves, in, daily, life, sartre, wrote, the, very, correctness, of, the, germans, caused, moral, corruption, in, many, people, who, used, the, correct, behavior, of, the, germans, as, an, excuse, for, passivity, and, the, very, act, of, simply, trying, to, live, one, s, day, to, day, existence, without, challenging, the, occupation, aided, the, new, order, in, europe, which, depended, upon, the, passivity, of, ordinary, people, to, accomplish, its, goals, throughout, the, occupation, it, was, german, policy, to, plunder, france, and, food, shortages, were, always, a, major, problem, as, the, majority, of, food, from, the, french, countryside, went, to, germany, sartre, wrote, about, the, languid, existence, of, the, parisians, as, people, waited, obsessively, for, the, one, weekly, arrival, of, trucks, bringing, food, from, the, countryside, that, the, germans, allowed, writing, paris, would, grow, peaked, and, yawn, with, hunger, under, the, empty, sky, cut, off, from, the, rest, of, the, world, fed, only, through, the, pity, or, some, ulterior, motive, the, town, led, a, purely, abstract, and, symbolic, life, sartre, himself, lived, on, a, diet, of, rabbits, sent, to, him, by, a, friend, of, de, beauvoir, living, in, anjou, the, rabbits, were, usually, in, an, advanced, state, of, decay, full, of, maggots, and, despite, being, hungry, sartre, once, threw, out, one, rabbit, as, uneatable, saying, it, had, more, maggots, in, it, than, meat, sartre, also, remarked, that, conversations, at, the, caf, de, flore, between, intellectuals, had, changed, as, the, fear, that, one, of, them, might, be, a, mouche, informer, or, a, writer, of, the, corbeau, anonymous, denunciatory, letters, meant, that, no, one, really, said, what, they, meant, anymore, imposing, self, censorship, sartre, and, his, friends, at, the, caf, de, flore, had, reasons, for, their, fear, by, september, 1940, the, abwehr, alone, had, already, recruited, 32, 000, french, people, to, work, as, mouches, while, by, 1942, the, paris, kommandantur, was, receiving, an, average, of, 1, 500, letters, per, day, sent, by, the, corbeaux, sartre, wrote, under, the, occupation, paris, had, become, a, sham, resembling, the, empty, wine, bottles, displayed, in, shop, windows, as, all, of, the, wine, had, been, exported, to, germany, looking, like, the, old, paris, but, hollowed, out, as, what, had, made, paris, special, was, gone, paris, had, almost, no, cars, on, the, streets, during, the, occupation, as, the, oil, went, to, germany, while, the, germans, imposed, a, nightly, curfew, which, led, sartre, to, remark, that, paris, was, peopled, by, the, absent, sartre, also, noted, that, people, began, to, disappear, under, the, occupation, writing, one, day, you, might, phone, a, friend, and, the, phone, would, ring, for, a, long, time, in, an, empty, flat, you, would, go, round, and, ring, the, doorbell, but, no, one, would, answer, it, if, the, concierge, forced, the, door, you, would, find, two, chairs, standing, close, together, in, the, hall, with, the, fag, ends, of, german, cigarettes, on, the, floor, between, their, legs, if, the, wife, or, mother, of, the, man, who, had, vanished, had, been, present, at, his, arrest, she, would, tell, you, that, he, had, been, taken, away, by, very, polite, germans, like, those, who, asked, the, way, in, the, street, and, when, she, went, to, ask, what, had, happened, to, them, at, the, offices, in, the, avenue, foch, or, the, rue, des, saussaies, she, would, be, politely, received, and, sent, away, with, comforting, words, sartre, wrote, the, feldgrau, field, grey, uniforms, of, the, wehrmacht, and, the, green, uniforms, of, the, order, police, which, had, seemed, so, alien, in, 1940, had, become, accepted, as, people, were, numbed, into, accepting, what, sartre, called, a, pale, dull, green, unobtrusive, strain, which, the, eye, almost, expected, to, find, among, the, dark, clothes, of, the, civilians, under, the, occupation, the, french, often, called, the, germans, les, autres, the, others, which, inspired, sartre, s, aphorism, in, his, play, huis, clos, no, exit, of, l, enfer, c, est, les, autres, hell, is, other, people, sartre, intended, the, line, l, enfer, c, est, les, autres, at, least, in, part, to, be, a, dig, at, the, german, occupiers, sartre, was, a, very, active, contributor, to, combat, a, newspaper, created, during, the, clandestine, period, by, albert, camus, a, philosopher, and, author, who, held, similar, beliefs, sartre, and, de, beauvoir, remained, friends, with, camus, until, 1951, with, the, publication, of, camus, s, the, rebel, sartre, wrote, extensively, post, war, about, neglected, minority, groups, namely, french, jews, and, black, people, in, 1946, he, published, anti, semite, and, jew, after, having, published, the, first, part, of, the, essay, portrait, de, l, antis, mite, the, year, before, in, les, temps, modernes, no, 3, in, the, essay, in, the, course, of, explaining, the, etiology, of, hate, as, the, hater, s, projective, fantasies, when, reflecting, on, the, jewish, question, he, attacks, antisemitism, in, france, during, a, time, when, the, jews, who, came, back, from, concentration, camps, were, quickly, abandoned, in, 1947, sartre, published, several, articles, concerning, the, condition, of, african, americans, in, the, united, states, specifically, the, racism, and, discrimination, against, them, in, the, country, in, his, second, situations, collection, then, in, 1948, for, the, introduction, of, l, opold, s, dar, senghor, s, l, anthologie, de, la, nouvelle, po, sie, n, gre, et, malgache, anthology, of, new, negro, and, malagasy, poetry, he, wrote, black, orpheus, re, published, in, situations, iii, a, critique, of, colonialism, and, racism, in, light, of, the, philosophy, sartre, developed, in, being, and, nothingness, later, while, sartre, was, labeled, by, some, authors, as, a, resistant, the, french, philosopher, and, resistant, vladimir, jankelevitch, criticized, sartre, s, lack, of, political, commitment, during, the, german, occupation, and, interpreted, his, further, struggles, for, liberty, as, an, attempt, to, redeem, himself, according, to, camus, sartre, was, a, writer, who, resisted, not, a, resister, who, wrote, in, 1945, after, the, war, ended, sartre, moved, to, an, apartment, on, the, rue, bonaparte, where, he, was, to, produce, most, of, his, subsequent, work, and, where, he, lived, until, 1962, it, was, from, there, that, he, helped, establish, a, quarterly, literary, and, political, review, les, temps, modernes, modern, times, in, part, to, popularize, his, thought, he, ceased, teaching, and, devoted, his, time, to, writing, and, political, activism, he, would, draw, on, his, war, experiences, for, his, great, trilogy, of, novels, les, chemins, de, la, libert, the, roads, to, freedom, 1945, 1949, the, first, period, of, sartre, s, career, defined, in, large, part, by, being, and, nothingness, 1943, gave, way, to, a, second, period, when, the, world, was, perceived, as, split, into, communist, and, capitalist, blocs, of, highly, publicized, political, involvement, sartre, tended, to, glorify, the, resistance, after, the, war, as, the, uncompromising, expression, of, morality, in, action, and, recalled, that, the, r, sistants, were, a, band, of, brothers, who, had, enjoyed, real, freedom, in, a, way, that, did, not, exist, before, nor, after, the, war, sartre, was, merciless, in, attacking, anyone, who, had, collaborated, or, remained, passive, during, the, german, occupation, for, instance, criticizing, camus, for, signing, an, appeal, to, spare, the, collaborationist, writer, robert, brasillach, from, being, executed, his, 1948, play, les, mains, sales, dirty, hands, in, particular, explored, the, problem, of, being, a, politically, engaged, intellectual, he, embraced, marxism, but, did, not, join, the, communist, party, for, a, time, in, the, late, 1940s, sartre, described, french, nationalism, as, provincial, and, in, a, 1949, essay, called, for, a, united, states, of, europe, in, an, essay, published, in, the, june, 1949, edition, of, the, journal, politique, trang, re, sartre, wrote, if, we, want, french, civilization, to, survive, it, must, be, fitted, into, the, framework, of, a, great, european, civilization, why, i, have, said, that, civilization, is, the, reflection, on, a, shared, situation, in, italy, in, france, in, benelux, in, sweden, in, norway, in, germany, in, greece, in, austria, everywhere, we, find, the, same, problems, and, the, same, dangers, but, this, cultural, polity, has, prospects, only, as, elements, of, a, policy, which, defends, europe, s, cultural, autonomy, vis, vis, america, and, the, soviet, union, but, also, its, political, and, economic, autonomy, with, the, aim, of, making, europe, a, single, force, between, the, blocs, not, a, third, bloc, but, an, autonomous, force, which, will, refuse, to, allow, itself, to, be, torn, into, shreds, between, american, optimism, and, russian, scientificism, about, the, korean, war, sartre, wrote, i, have, no, doubt, that, the, south, korean, feudalists, and, the, american, imperialists, have, promoted, this, war, but, i, do, not, doubt, either, that, it, was, begun, by, the, north, koreans, in, july, 1950, sartre, wrote, in, les, temps, modernes, about, his, and, de, beauvoir, s, attitude, to, the, soviet, union, as, we, were, neither, members, of, the, party, nor, its, avowed, sympathizers, it, was, not, our, duty, to, write, about, soviet, labor, camps, we, were, free, to, remain, aloof, from, the, quarrel, over, the, nature, of, this, system, provided, that, no, events, of, sociological, significance, had, occurred, sartre, held, that, the, soviet, union, was, a, revolutionary, state, working, for, the, betterment, of, humanity, and, could, be, criticized, only, for, failing, to, live, up, to, its, own, ideals, but, that, critics, had, to, take, in, mind, that, the, soviet, state, needed, to, defend, itself, against, a, hostile, world, by, contrast, sartre, held, that, the, failures, of, bourgeois, states, were, due, to, their, innate, shortcomings, the, swiss, journalist, fran, ois, bondy, wrote, that, based, on, a, reading, of, sartre, s, numerous, essays, speeches, and, interviews, a, simple, basic, pattern, never, fails, to, emerge, social, change, must, be, comprehensive, and, revolutionary, and, the, parties, that, promote, the, revolutionary, charges, may, be, criticized, but, only, by, those, who, completely, identify, themselves, with, its, purpose, its, struggle, and, its, road, to, power, deeming, sartre, s, position, to, be, existentialist, sartre, believed, at, this, time, in, the, moral, superiority, of, the, eastern, bloc, arguing, that, this, belief, was, necessary, to, keep, hope, alive, and, opposed, any, criticism, of, soviet, union, to, the, extent, that, maurice, merleau, ponty, called, him, an, ultra, bolshevik, sartre, s, expression, workers, of, billancourt, must, not, be, deprived, of, their, hopes, fr, il, ne, faut, pas, d, sesp, rer, billancourt, became, a, catchphrase, meaning, communist, activists, should, not, tell, the, whole, truth, to, the, workers, in, order, to, avoid, decline, in, their, revolutionary, enthusiasm, in, 1954, just, after, stalin, s, death, sartre, visited, the, soviet, union, which, he, stated, he, found, a, complete, freedom, of, criticism, while, condemning, the, united, states, for, sinking, into, prefascism, sartre, wrote, about, those, soviet, writers, expelled, from, the, soviet, writers, union, still, had, the, opportunity, of, rehabilitating, themselves, by, writing, better, books, sartre, s, comments, on, hungarian, revolution, of, 1956, are, quite, representative, to, his, frequently, contradictory, and, changing, views, on, one, hand, sartre, saw, in, hungary, a, true, reunification, between, intellectuals, and, workers, only, to, criticize, it, for, losing, socialist, base, in, 1964, sartre, attacked, khrushchev, s, secret, speech, which, condemned, the, stalinist, repressions, and, purges, sartre, argued, that, the, masses, were, not, ready, to, receive, the, truth, in, 1969, sartre, along, with, other, fifteen, prominent, french, writers, including, louis, aragon, and, michel, butor, signed, the, letter, of, protest, against, the, expulsion, of, the, writer, most, representative, of, the, great, russian, tradition, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, already, a, victim, of, stalinist, repression, from, the, union, of, soviet, writers, in, 1973, he, argued, that, revolutionary, authority, always, needs, to, get, rid, of, some, people, that, threaten, it, and, their, death, is, the, only, way, a, number, of, people, starting, from, frank, gibney, in, 1961, classified, sartre, as, a, useful, idiot, due, to, his, uncritical, position, sartre, came, to, admire, the, polish, leader, w, adys, aw, gomu, ka, a, man, who, favored, a, polish, road, to, socialism, and, wanted, more, independence, for, poland, but, was, loyal, to, the, soviet, union, because, of, the, oder, neisse, line, issue, sartre, s, newspaper, les, temps, modernes, devoted, a, number, of, special, issues, in, 1957, and, 1958, to, poland, under, gomu, ka, praising, him, for, his, reforms, bondy, wrote, of, the, notable, contradiction, between, sartre, s, ultra, bolshevism, as, he, expressed, admiration, for, the, chinese, leader, mao, zedong, as, the, man, who, led, the, oppressed, masses, of, the, third, world, into, revolution, while, also, praising, more, moderate, communist, leaders, like, gomu, ka, as, an, anti, colonialist, sartre, took, a, prominent, role, in, the, struggle, against, french, rule, in, algeria, and, the, use, of, torture, and, concentration, camps, by, the, french, in, algeria, he, became, an, eminent, supporter, of, the, fln, in, the, algerian, war, and, was, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, manifeste, des, 121, consequently, sartre, became, a, domestic, target, of, the, paramilitary, organisation, arm, e, secr, te, oas, escaping, two, bomb, attacks, in, the, early, 60s, he, later, argued, in, 1959, that, each, french, person, was, responsible, for, the, collective, crimes, during, the, algerian, war, of, independence, he, had, an, algerian, mistress, arlette, elka, m, who, became, his, adopted, daughter, in, 1965, he, opposed, u, s, involvement, in, the, vietnam, war, and, along, with, bertrand, russell, and, others, organized, a, tribunal, intended, to, expose, u, s, war, crimes, which, became, known, as, the, russell, tribunal, in, 1967, his, work, after, stalin, s, death, the, critique, de, la, raison, dialectique, critique, of, dialectical, reason, appeared, in, 1960, a, second, volume, appearing, posthumously, in, the, critique, sartre, set, out, to, give, marxism, a, more, vigorous, intellectual, defense, than, it, had, received, until, then, he, ended, by, concluding, that, marx, s, notion, of, class, as, an, objective, entity, was, fallacious, sartre, s, emphasis, on, the, humanist, values, in, the, early, works, of, marx, led, to, a, dispute, with, a, leading, leftist, intellectual, in, france, in, the, 1960s, louis, althusser, who, claimed, that, the, ideas, of, the, young, marx, were, decisively, superseded, by, the, scientific, system, of, the, later, marx, in, the, late, 1950s, sartre, began, to, argue, that, the, european, working, classes, were, too, apolitical, to, carry, out, the, revolution, predicated, by, marx, and, influenced, by, frantz, fanon, started, to, argue, it, was, the, impoverished, masses, of, the, third, world, the, real, damned, of, the, earth, who, would, carry, out, the, revolution, a, major, theme, of, sartre, s, political, essays, in, the, 1960s, was, of, his, disgust, with, the, americanization, of, the, french, working, class, who, would, much, rather, watch, american, tv, shows, dubbed, into, french, than, agitate, for, a, revolution, sartre, went, to, cuba, in, the, 1960s, to, meet, fidel, castro, and, spoke, with, ernesto, che, guevara, after, guevara, s, death, sartre, would, declare, him, to, be, not, only, an, intellectual, but, also, the, most, complete, human, being, of, our, age, and, the, era, s, most, perfect, man, sartre, would, also, compliment, guevara, by, professing, that, he, lived, his, words, spoke, his, own, actions, and, his, story, and, the, story, of, the, world, ran, parallel, however, he, stood, against, the, persecution, of, gays, by, castro, s, government, which, he, compared, to, nazi, persecution, of, the, jews, and, said, in, cuba, there, are, no, jews, but, there, are, homosexuals, during, a, collective, hunger, strike, in, 1974, sartre, visited, red, army, faction, member, andreas, baader, in, stammheim, prison, and, criticized, the, harsh, conditions, of, imprisonment, towards, the, end, of, his, life, sartre, began, to, describe, himself, as, a, special, kind, of, anarchist, in, 1964, sartre, renounced, literature, in, a, witty, and, sardonic, account, of, the, first, ten, years, of, his, life, les, mots, the, words, the, book, is, an, ironic, counterblast, to, marcel, proust, whose, reputation, had, unexpectedly, eclipsed, that, of, andr, gide, who, had, provided, the, model, of, litt, rature, engag, e, for, sartre, s, generation, literature, sartre, concluded, functioned, ultimately, as, a, bourgeois, substitute, for, real, commitment, in, the, world, in, october, 1964, sartre, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, but, he, declined, it, he, was, the, first, nobel, laureate, to, voluntarily, decline, the, prize, and, remains, one, of, only, two, laureates, to, do, so, according, to, lars, gyllensten, in, the, book, minnen, bara, minnen, memories, only, memories, published, in, 2000, sartre, himself, or, someone, close, to, him, got, in, touch, with, the, swedish, academy, in, 1975, with, a, request, for, the, prize, money, but, was, refused, in, 1945, he, had, refused, the, l, gion, d, honneur, the, nobel, prize, was, announced, on, 22, october, 1964, on, 14, october, sartre, had, written, a, letter, to, the, nobel, institute, asking, to, be, removed, from, the, list, of, nominees, and, warning, that, he, would, not, accept, the, prize, if, awarded, but, the, letter, went, unread, on, 23, october, le, figaro, published, a, statement, by, sartre, explaining, his, refusal, he, said, he, did, not, wish, to, be, transformed, by, such, an, award, and, did, not, want, to, take, sides, in, an, east, vs, west, cultural, struggle, by, accepting, an, award, from, a, prominent, western, cultural, institution, nevertheless, he, was, that, year, s, prizewinner, though, his, name, was, then, a, household, word, as, was, existentialism, during, the, tumultuous, 1960s, sartre, remained, a, simple, man, with, few, possessions, actively, committed, to, causes, until, the, end, of, his, life, such, as, the, may, 1968, strikes, in, paris, during, the, summer, of, 1968, during, which, he, was, arrested, for, civil, disobedience, president, charles, de, gaulle, intervened, and, pardoned, him, commenting, that, you, don, t, arrest, voltaire, in, 1975, when, asked, how, he, would, like, to, be, remembered, sartre, replied, i, would, like, to, remember, nausea, no, exit, and, the, devil, and, the, good, lord, and, then, my, two, philosophical, works, more, particularly, the, second, one, critique, of, dialectical, reason, then, my, essay, on, genet, saint, genet, if, these, are, remembered, that, would, be, quite, an, achievement, and, i, don, t, ask, for, more, as, a, man, if, a, certain, jean, paul, sartre, is, remembered, i, would, like, people, to, remember, the, milieu, or, historical, situation, in, which, i, lived, how, i, lived, in, it, in, terms, of, all, the, aspirations, which, i, tried, to, gather, up, within, myself, sartre, s, physical, condition, deteriorated, partially, because, of, the, merciless, pace, of, work, and, the, use, of, amphetamine, he, put, himself, through, during, the, writing, of, the, critique, and, a, massive, analytical, biography, of, gustave, flaubert, the, family, idiot, both, of, which, remained, unfinished, he, had, hypertension, and, became, almost, completely, blind, in, 1973, sartre, was, a, notorious, chain, smoker, which, could, also, have, contributed, to, the, deterioration, of, his, health, sartre, died, on, 15, april, 1980, in, paris, from, pulmonary, edema, he, had, not, wanted, to, be, buried, at, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, between, his, mother, and, stepfather, so, it, was, arranged, that, he, be, buried, at, montparnasse, cemetery, at, his, funeral, on, saturday, 19, april, 50, 000, parisians, descended, onto, boulevard, du, montparnasse, to, accompany, sartre, s, cortege, the, funeral, started, at, the, hospital, at, 2, 00, p, m, then, filed, through, the, fourteenth, arrondissement, past, all, sartre, s, haunts, and, entered, the, cemetery, through, the, gate, on, the, boulevard, edgar, quinet, sartre, was, initially, buried, in, a, temporary, grave, to, the, left, of, the, cemetery, gate, four, days, later, the, body, was, disinterred, for, cremation, at, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, and, his, ashes, were, reburied, at, the, permanent, site, in, montparnasse, cemetery, to, the, right, of, the, cemetery, gate, sartre, s, primary, idea, is, that, people, as, humans, are, condemned, to, be, free, he, explained, this, may, seem, paradoxical, because, condemnation, is, normally, an, external, judgment, which, constitutes, the, conclusion, of, a, judgment, here, it, is, not, the, human, who, has, chosen, to, be, like, this, there, is, a, contingency, of, human, existence, it, is, a, condemnation, of, their, being, their, being, is, not, determined, so, it, is, up, to, everyone, to, create, their, own, existence, for, which, they, are, then, responsible, they, cannot, not, be, free, there, is, a, form, of, necessity, for, freedom, which, can, never, be, given, up, this, theory, relies, upon, his, position, that, there, is, no, creator, and, is, illustrated, using, the, example, of, the, paper, cutter, sartre, says, that, if, one, considered, a, paper, cutter, one, would, assume, that, the, creator, would, have, had, a, plan, for, it, an, essence, sartre, said, that, human, beings, have, no, essence, before, their, existence, because, there, is, no, creator, thus, existence, precedes, essence, this, forms, the, basis, for, his, assertion, that, because, one, cannot, explain, one, s, own, actions, and, behavior, by, referring, to, any, specific, human, nature, they, are, necessarily, fully, responsible, for, those, actions, we, are, left, alone, without, excuse, we, can, act, without, being, determined, by, our, past, which, is, always, separated, from, us, sartre, maintained, that, the, concepts, of, authenticity, and, individuality, have, to, be, earned, but, not, learned, we, need, to, experience, death, consciousness, so, as, to, wake, up, ourselves, as, to, what, is, really, important, the, authentic, in, our, lives, which, is, life, experience, not, knowledge, death, draws, the, final, point, when, we, as, beings, cease, to, live, for, ourselves, and, permanently, become, objects, that, exist, only, for, the, outside, world, in, this, way, death, emphasizes, the, burden, of, our, free, individual, existence, we, can, oppose, authenticity, to, an, inauthentic, way, of, being, authenticity, consists, in, experiencing, the, indeterminate, character, of, existence, in, anguish, it, is, also, to, know, how, to, face, it, by, giving, meaning, to, our, actions, and, by, recognizing, ourselves, as, the, author, of, this, meaning, on, the, other, hand, an, inauthentic, way, of, being, consists, in, running, away, in, lying, to, oneself, in, order, to, escape, this, anguish, and, the, responsibility, for, one, s, own, existence, while, sartre, had, been, influenced, by, heidegger, the, publication, of, being, and, nothingness, did, mark, a, split, in, their, perspectives, with, heidegger, remarking, in, letter, on, humanism, existentialism, says, existence, precedes, essence, in, this, statement, he, is, taking, existentia, and, essentia, according, to, their, metaphysical, meaning, which, from, plato, s, time, on, has, said, that, essentia, precedes, existentia, sartre, reverses, this, statement, but, the, reversal, of, a, metaphysical, statement, remains, a, metaphysical, statement, with, it, he, stays, with, metaphysics, in, oblivion, of, the, truth, of, being, herbert, marcuse, also, had, issues, with, sartre, s, metaphysical, interpretation, of, human, existence, in, being, and, nothingness, and, suggested, the, work, projected, anxiety, and, meaninglessness, onto, the, nature, of, existence, itself, insofar, as, existentialism, is, a, philosophical, doctrine, it, remains, an, idealistic, doctrine, it, hypostatizes, specific, historical, conditions, of, human, existence, into, ontological, and, metaphysical, characteristics, existentialism, thus, becomes, part, of, the, very, ideology, which, it, attacks, and, its, radicalism, is, illusory, sartre, also, took, inspiration, from, phenomenological, epistemology, explained, by, franz, adler, in, this, way, man, chooses, and, makes, himself, by, acting, any, action, implies, the, judgment, that, he, is, right, under, the, circumstances, not, only, for, the, actor, but, also, for, everybody, else, in, similar, circumstances, also, important, is, sartre, s, analysis, of, psychological, concepts, including, his, suggestion, that, consciousness, exists, as, something, other, than, itself, and, that, the, conscious, awareness, of, things, is, not, limited, to, their, knowledge, for, sartre, intentionality, applies, to, the, emotions, as, well, as, to, cognitions, to, desires, as, well, as, to, perceptions, when, an, external, object, is, perceived, consciousness, is, also, conscious, of, itself, even, if, consciousness, is, not, its, own, object, it, is, a, non, positional, consciousness, of, itself, however, his, critique, of, psychoanalysis, particularly, of, freud, has, faced, some, counter, critique, richard, wollheim, and, thomas, baldwin, argued, that, sartre, s, attempt, to, show, that, sigmund, freud, s, theory, of, the, unconscious, is, mistaken, was, based, on, a, misinterpretation, of, freud, while, the, broad, focus, of, sartre, s, life, revolved, around, the, notion, of, human, freedom, he, began, a, sustained, intellectual, participation, in, more, public, matters, towards, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, around, 1944, 1945, before, world, war, ii, he, was, content, with, the, role, of, an, apolitical, liberal, intellectual, now, teaching, at, a, lyc, e, in, laon, sartre, made, his, headquarters, the, dome, caf, at, the, crossing, of, montparnasse, and, raspail, boulevards, he, attended, plays, read, novels, and, dined, women, he, wrote, and, he, was, published, sartre, and, his, lifelong, companion, de, beauvoir, existed, in, her, words, where, the, world, about, us, was, a, mere, backdrop, against, which, our, private, lives, were, played, out, the, war, opened, sartre, s, eyes, to, a, political, reality, he, had, not, yet, understood, until, forced, into, continual, engagement, with, it, the, world, itself, destroyed, sartre, s, illusions, about, isolated, self, determining, individuals, and, made, clear, his, own, personal, stake, in, the, events, of, the, time, returning, to, paris, in, 1941, he, formed, the, socialisme, et, libert, resistance, group, in, 1943, after, the, group, disbanded, sartre, joined, a, writers, resistance, group, in, which, he, remained, an, active, participant, until, the, end, of, the, war, he, continued, to, write, ferociously, and, it, was, due, to, this, crucial, experience, of, war, and, captivity, that, sartre, began, to, try, to, build, up, a, positive, moral, system, and, to, express, it, through, literature, the, symbolic, initiation, of, this, new, phase, in, sartre, s, work, is, packaged, in, the, introduction, he, wrote, for, a, new, journal, les, temps, modernes, in, october, 1945, here, he, aligned, the, journal, and, thus, himself, with, the, left, and, called, for, writers, to, express, their, political, commitment, yet, this, alignment, was, indefinite, directed, more, to, the, concept, of, the, left, than, a, specific, party, of, the, left, sartre, s, philosophy, lent, itself, to, his, being, a, public, intellectual, he, envisaged, culture, as, a, very, fluid, concept, neither, pre, determined, nor, definitely, finished, instead, in, true, existential, fashion, culture, was, always, conceived, as, a, process, of, continual, invention, and, re, invention, this, marks, sartre, the, intellectual, as, a, pragmatist, willing, to, move, and, shift, stance, along, with, events, he, did, not, dogmatically, follow, a, cause, other, than, the, belief, in, human, freedom, preferring, to, retain, a, pacifist, s, objectivity, it, is, this, overarching, theme, of, freedom, that, means, his, work, subverts, the, bases, for, distinctions, among, the, disciplines, therefore, he, was, able, to, hold, knowledge, across, a, vast, array, of, subjects, the, international, world, order, the, political, and, economic, organisation, of, contemporary, society, especially, france, the, institutional, and, legal, frameworks, that, regulate, the, lives, of, ordinary, citizens, the, educational, system, the, media, networks, that, control, and, disseminate, information, sartre, systematically, refused, to, keep, quiet, about, what, he, saw, as, inequalities, and, injustices, in, the, world, sartre, always, sympathized, with, the, left, and, supported, the, french, communist, party, pcf, until, the, 1956, soviet, invasion, of, hungary, following, the, liberation, the, pcf, were, infuriated, by, sartre, s, philosophy, which, appeared, to, lure, young, french, men, and, women, away, from, the, ideology, of, communism, and, into, sartre, s, own, existentialism, from, 1956, onwards, sartre, rejected, the, claims, of, the, pcf, to, represent, the, french, working, classes, objecting, to, its, authoritarian, tendencies, in, the, late, 1960s, sartre, supported, the, maoists, a, movement, that, rejected, the, authority, of, established, communist, parties, however, despite, aligning, with, the, maoists, sartre, said, after, the, may, events, if, one, rereads, all, my, books, one, will, realize, that, i, have, not, changed, profoundly, and, that, i, have, always, remained, an, anarchist, he, would, later, explicitly, allow, himself, to, be, called, an, anarchist, in, the, aftermath, of, a, war, that, had, for, the, first, time, properly, engaged, sartre, in, political, matters, he, set, forth, a, body, of, work, which, reflected, on, virtually, every, important, theme, of, his, early, thought, and, began, to, explore, alternative, solutions, to, the, problems, posed, there, the, greatest, difficulties, that, he, and, all, public, intellectuals, of, the, time, faced, were, the, increasing, technological, aspects, of, the, world, that, were, outdating, the, printed, word, as, a, form, of, expression, in, sartre, s, opinion, the, traditional, bourgeois, literary, forms, remain, innately, superior, but, there, is, a, recognition, that, the, new, technological, mass, media, forms, must, be, embraced, if, sartre, s, ethical, and, political, goals, as, an, authentic, committed, intellectual, are, to, be, achieved, the, demystification, of, bourgeois, political, practices, and, the, raising, of, the, consciousness, both, political, and, cultural, of, the, working, class, the, struggle, for, sartre, was, against, the, monopolising, moguls, who, were, beginning, to, take, over, the, media, and, destroy, the, role, of, the, intellectual, his, attempts, to, reach, a, public, were, mediated, by, these, powers, and, it, was, often, these, powers, he, had, to, campaign, against, he, was, skilled, enough, however, to, circumvent, some, of, these, issues, by, his, interactive, approach, to, the, various, forms, of, media, advertising, his, radio, interviews, in, a, newspaper, column, for, example, and, vice, versa, sartre, s, role, as, a, public, intellectual, occasionally, put, him, in, physical, danger, such, as, in, june, 1961, when, a, plastic, bomb, exploded, in, the, entrance, of, his, apartment, building, his, public, support, of, algerian, self, determination, at, the, time, had, led, sartre, to, become, a, target, of, the, campaign, of, terror, that, mounted, as, the, colonists, position, deteriorated, a, similar, occurrence, took, place, the, next, year, and, he, had, begun, to, receive, threatening, letters, from, oran, algeria, sartre, s, role, in, this, conflict, included, his, comments, in, his, preface, to, frantz, fanon, s, the, wretched, of, the, earth, that, to, shoot, down, a, european, is, to, kill, two, birds, with, one, stone, to, destroy, an, oppressor, and, the, man, he, oppresses, at, the, same, time, there, remains, a, dead, man, and, a, free, man, this, comment, led, to, some, criticisms, from, the, right, such, as, by, brian, c, anderson, and, michael, walzer, writing, for, the, hoover, institution, walzer, suggested, that, sartre, a, european, was, a, hypocrite, for, not, volunteering, to, be, killed, however, sartre, s, stances, regarding, post, colonial, conflict, have, not, been, entirely, without, controversy, on, the, left, sartre, s, preface, is, omitted, from, some, editions, of, the, wretched, of, the, earth, printed, after, 1967, the, reason, for, this, is, for, his, public, support, for, israel, in, the, six, day, war, fanon, s, widow, josie, considered, sartre, s, pro, israel, stance, as, inconsistent, with, the, anti, colonialist, position, of, the, book, from, which, his, preface, was, eventually, omitted, when, interviewed, at, howard, university, in, 1978, she, explained, when, israel, declared, war, on, the, arab, countries, there, was, a, great, pro, zionist, movement, in, favor, of, israel, among, western, french, intellectuals, sartre, took, part, in, this, movement, he, signed, petitions, favoring, israel, i, felt, that, his, pro, zionist, attitudes, were, incompatible, with, fanon, s, work, recent, reprints, of, fanon, s, book, have, generally, included, sartre, s, preface, sartre, wrote, successfully, in, a, number, of, literary, modes, and, made, major, contributions, to, literary, criticism, and, literary, biography, his, plays, are, richly, symbolic, and, serve, as, a, means, of, conveying, his, philosophy, the, best, known, huis, clos, no, exit, contains, the, famous, line, l, enfer, c, est, les, autres, usually, translated, as, hell, is, other, people, aside, from, the, impact, of, nausea, sartre, s, major, work, of, fiction, was, the, roads, to, freedom, trilogy, which, charts, the, progression, of, how, world, war, ii, affected, sartre, s, ideas, in, this, way, roads, to, freedom, presents, a, less, theoretical, and, more, practical, approach, to, existentialism, john, huston, got, sartre, to, script, his, film, freud, the, secret, passion, however, it, was, too, long, and, sartre, withdrew, his, name, from, the, film, s, credits, nevertheless, many, key, elements, from, sartre, s, script, survive, in, the, finished, film, despite, their, similarities, as, polemicists, novelists, adapters, and, playwrights, sartre, s, literary, work, has, been, counterposed, often, pejoratively, to, that, of, camus, in, the, popular, imagination, in, 1948, the, roman, catholic, church, placed, sartre, s, uvre, on, the, index, librorum, prohibitorum, list, of, prohibited, books, in, 1993, french, author, bianca, lamblin, originally, bianca, bienenfeld, wrote, in, her, book, m, moires, d, une, jeune, fille, d, rang, e, memoirs, of, a, deranged, girl, published, in, english, under, the, title, a, disgraceful, affair, of, her, sexual, exploitation, by, sartre, and, beauvoir, lamblin, claims, that, while, a, student, at, lyc, e, moli, re, she, was, sexually, exploited, by, her, teacher, beauvoir, who, introduced, her, to, sartre, a, year, later, bianca, wrote, her, m, moires, in, response, to, the, posthumous, 1990, publication, of, jean, paul, sartre, s, lettres, au, castor, et, quelques, autres, 1926, 1963, letters, to, castor, and, other, friends, in, which, she, noted, that, she, was, referred, to, by, the, pseudonym, louise, v, drine, sartre, and, beauvoir, frequently, followed, this, pattern, in, which, beauvoir, would, seduce, female, students, and, then, pass, them, on, to, sartre
