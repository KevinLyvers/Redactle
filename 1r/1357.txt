the, opposition, was, the, key, feature, of, trujillo, s, rule, from, the, very, beginning, in, 1930, when, his, gang, the, 42, led, by, miguel, angel, paulino, drove, through, the, streets, in, their, red, packard, carro, de, la, muerte, car, of, death, trujillo, also, maintained, an, execution, list, of, people, throughout, the, world, who, he, felt, were, his, direct, enemies, or, who, he, felt, had, wronged, him, he, even, once, allowed, an, opposition, party, to, form, and, permitted, it, to, operate, legally, and, openly, mainly, so, that, he, could, identify, those, who, opposed, him, and, arrest, or, kill, them, imprisonments, and, killings, were, later, handled, by, the, sim, the, servicio, de, inteligencia, militar, efficiently, organized, by, johnny, abbes, who, operated, in, cuba, mexico, guatemala, new, york, costa, rica, and, venezuela, some, cases, reached, international, notoriety, such, as, the, disappearance, of, jes, s, de, gal, ndez, and, the, murder, of, the, mirabal, sisters, which, further, eroded, trujillo, s, critical, support, by, the, us, government, after, trujillo, approved, an, assassination, attempt, on, the, venezuelan, president, r, mulo, ernesto, betancourt, bello, the, organization, of, american, states, and, the, united, states, blocked, trujillo, s, access, to, us, sugar, quota, profits, in, april, 1962, after, the, flight, of,

investigators, from, vasquez, s, office, to, have, been, tossed, to, sharks, or, were, stuffed, into, an, incinerator, at, nearby, san, isidro, airbase, trujillo, was, known, for, his, open, door, policy, accepting, jewish, refugees, from, europe, japanese, migration, during, the, 1930s, and, exiles, from, spain, following, its, civil, war, at, the, 1938, vian, conference, the, dominican,

favored, white, refugees, over, others, while, dominican, troops, expelled, illegal, immigrants, resulting, in, the, 1937, parsley, massacre, of, haitian, migrants, the, trujillo, regime, greatly, expanded, the, vedado, del, yaque, a, nature, reserve, around, the, yaque, del, sur, river, in, 1934, he, banned, the, slash, and, burn, method, of, clearing, land, for, agriculture, set, up, a,

hydroelectric, potential, of, damming, the, dominican, republic, s, waterways, the, commission, concluded, that, only, forested, waterways, could, support, hydroelectric, dams, so, trujillo, banned, logging, in, potential, river, watersheds, after, his, assassination, in, 1961, logging, resumed, in, the, dominican, republic, squatters, burned, down, the, forests, for, agriculture, and, logging,

1941, while, there, was, no, military, participation, the, dominican, republic, thus, became, a, founding, member, of, the, united, nations, trujillo, encouraged, diplomatic, and, economic, ties, with, the, united, states, but, his, policies, often, caused, friction, with, other, nations, of, latin, america, especially, costa, rica, and, venezuela, he, maintained, friendly, relations, with, franco, of, spain, per, n, of, argentina, and, somoza, of, nicaragua, towards, the, end, of, his, rule, his, relationship, with, the, united, states, deteriorated, early, on, trujillo, determined, that, dominican, financial, affairs, had, to, be, put, in, order, and, that, included, ending, the, united, states, s, role, as, collector, of, dominican, customs, a, situation, that, had, existed, since, 1907, and, was, confirmed, in, a, 1924, convention, signed, at, the, end, of, the, occupation, negotiations, started, in, 1936, and, lasted, four, years, on, 24, september, 1940, trujillo, and, the, american, secretary, of, state, cordell, hull, signed, the, hull, trujillo, treaty, whereby, the, united, states, relinquished, control, over, the, collection, and, application, of, customs, revenues, and, the, dominican, republic, committed, to, deposit, consolidated, government, revenues, in, a, special, bank, account, to, guarantee, repayment, of, foreign, debt, the, government, was, free, to, set, custom, duties, with, no, restrictions, this, diplomatic, success, gave, trujillo, the, occasion, to, launch, a, massive, propaganda, campaign, that, presented, him, as, the, savior, of, the, nation, a, law, proclaimed, that, the, benefactor, was, also, now, the, restaurador, de, la, independencia, financiera, de, la, republica, restorer, of, the, republic, s, financial, independence, haiti, formerly, occupied, what, is, today, called, the, dominican, republic, for, 22, years, from, 1822, to, 1844, prior, to, their, occupation, spanish, colonial, rule, prevailed, encroachment, by, haiti, was, an, ongoing, process, and, when, trujillo, took, over, specifically, the, northwestern, border, region, had, become, increasingly, haitianized, the, border, was, poorly, defined, in, 1933, and, again, in, 1935, trujillo, met, the, haitian, president, st, nio, vincent, to, settle, the, border, issue, by, 1936, they, reached, and, signed, a, settlement, at, the, same, time, trujillo, plotted, against, the, haitian, government, by, linking, up, with, general, calixte, commander, of, the, garde, d, haiti, and, lie, lescot, at, that, time, the, haitian, ambassador, in, ciudad, trujillo, santo, domingo, after, the, settlement, when, further, border, incursions, occurred, trujillo, initiated, the, parsley, massacre, known, as, la, masacre, del, perejil, in, spanish, the, massacre, was, started, by, trujillo, in, 1937, claiming, that, haiti, was, harboring, his, former, dominican, opponents, he, ordered, an, attack, on, the, border, that, slaughtered, tens, of, thousands, of, haitians, as, they, tried, to, escape, the, number, of, dead, is, still, unknown, but, it, is, now, calculated, between, 12, 000, and, 30, 000, the, dominican, military, used, machetes, to, murder, and, decapitate, many, of, the, victims, they, also, took, people, to, the, port, of, montecristi, where, many, victims, were, thrown, into, the, sea, to, drown, with, their, hands, and, feet, bound, the, haitian, response, was, muted, but, its, government, eventually, called, for, an, international, investigation, under, pressure, from, washington, trujillo, agreed, to, a, reparation, settlement, in, january, 1938, of, us, 750, 000, by, the, next, year, the, amount, had, been, reduced, to, us, 525, 000, us, 11, 13, million, in, 2024, 30, dollars, per, victim, of, which, only, two, cents, were, given, to, survivors, because, of, corruption, in, the, haitian, bureaucracy, in, 1941, lescot, who, had, received, financial, support, from, trujillo, succeeded, vincent, as, president, of, haiti, trujillo, expected, that, lescot, would, be, his, puppet, but, lescot, turned, against, him, trujillo, unsuccessfully, tried, to, assassinate, him, in, a, 1944, plot, and, then, published, their, correspondence, to, discredit, him, lescot, fled, into, exile, in, 1946, after, demonstrations, against, him, in, 1947, dominican, exiles, including, juan, bosch, had, concentrated, in, cuba, with, the, approval, and, support, of, cuba, s, government, led, by, ram, n, grau, an, expeditionary, force, was, trained, with, the, intention, of, invading, the, dominican, republic, and, overthrowing, trujillo, however, international, pressure, including, from, the, united, states, made, the, exiles, abort, the, expedition, in, turn, when, fulgencio, batista, was, in, power, trujillo, initially, supported, anti, batista, supporters, of, carlos, pr, o, socarr, s, in, oriente, province, in, 1955, however, weapons, trujillo, sent, were, soon, inherited, by, fidel, castro, s, insurgents, when, pr, o, allied, with, castro, dominican, made, crist, bal, carbines, and, hand, grenades, became, the, rebels, standard, weapons, after, 1956, when, trujillo, saw, that, castro, was, gaining, ground, he, started, to, support, batista, with, money, planes, equipment, and, men, trujillo, convinced, that, batista, would, prevail, was, very, surprised, when, batista, showed, up, as, a, fugitive, after, he, had, been, ousted, trujillo, kept, batista, until, august, 1959, as, a, virtual, prisoner, only, after, paying, us, 3, 4, million, could, batista,
