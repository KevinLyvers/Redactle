lu, s, vaz, de, cam, es, european, portuguese, c, 1524, or, 1525, 10, june, 1580, sometimes, rendered, in, english, as, camoens, or, camo, ns, k, m, o, n, z, kam, oh, nz, is, considered, portugal, s, and, the, portuguese, language, s, greatest, poet, his, mastery, of, verse, has, been, compared, to, that, of, shakespeare, milton, vondel, homer, virgil, and, dante, he, wrote, a, considerable, amount, of, lyrical, poetry, and, drama, but, is, best, remembered, for, his, epic, work, os, lus, adas, the, lusiads, his, collection, of, poetry, the, parnasum, of, lu, s, de, cam, es, was, lost, during, his, life, the, influence, of, his, masterpiece, os, lus, adas, is, so, profound, that, portuguese, is, sometimes, called, the, language, of, cam, es, the, day, of, his, death, 10, june, os, is, portugal, s, national, day, much, of, the, information, about, lu, s, de, cam, es, biography, raises, doubts, and, probably, much, of, what, circulates, about, him, is, nothing, more, than, the, typical, folklore, that, is, formed, around, a, famous, figure, only, a, few, dates, are, documented, that, guide, its, trajectory, the, ancestral, home, of, the, cam, es, family, had, its, origins, in, the, kingdom, of, galicia, not, far, from, cape, finisterre, on, his, paternal, side, lu, s, de, cam, es, was, descended, from, vasco, pires, de, cam, es, galician, troubadour, warrior, and, fidalgo, who, moved, to, portugal, in, 1370, and, received, great, benefits, from, the, king, in, positions, honours, and, lands, and, whose, poetry, of, a, nationalist, nature, contributed, to, ward, off, breton, and, italian, influence, and, to, shape, a, national, troubadour, style, his, son, ant, o, vaz, de, cam, es, served, in, the, red, sea, and, married, dona, guiomar, da, gama, related, to, vasco, da, gama, from, this, marriage, were, born, sim, o, vaz, de, cam, es, who, served, in, the, royal, navy, and, did, trade, in, guinea, and, india, and, another, brother, bento, who, followed, the, career, of, a, man, of, letters, and, entered, the, priesthood, joining, the, austin, friars, at, the, monastery, of, santa, cruz, which, was, a, prestigious, school, for, many, young, portuguese, gentlemen, sim, o, married, dona, ana, de, s, e, macedo, also, from, a, noble, family, from, santar, m, her, only, son, lu, s, vaz, de, cam, es, according, to, jayne, fernandes, and, some, other, authors, was, born, in, lisbon, in, 1524, three, years, later, the, city, was, being, threatened, by, the, plague, the, family, moved, following, the, court, to, coimbra, however, other, cities, claim, the, honour, of, being, his, birthplace, coimbra, santar, m, and, alenquer, although, the, first, biographers, of, cam, es, severin, de, faria, and, manoel, correa, initially, gave, his, year, of, birth, as, 1517, records, of, the, lists, of, the, casa, da, ndia, later, consulted, by, manuel, de, faria, e, sousa, seem, to, establish, that, cam, es, was, actually, born, in, lisbon, in, 1524, the, arguments, for, placing, his, birth, outside, of, lisbon, are, weak, but, neither, is, it, completely, beyond, doubt, so, the, most, recent, scholarship, considers, his, place, and, date, of, birth, uncertain, about, his, childhood, much, remains, unknown, at, twelve, or, thirteen, he, would, have, been, protected, and, educated, by, his, uncle, bento, who, sent, him, to, coimbra, to, study, tradition, says, that, he, was, an, undisciplined, student, but, eager, for, knowledge, interested, in, history, cosmography, and, classic, and, modern, literature, however, his, name, does, not, appear, in, the, records, of, the, university, of, coimbra, but, it, is, certain, from, his, elaborate, style, and, the, profusion, of, erudite, quotes, that, appear, in, his, works, that, in, some, way, he, received, a, solid, education, it, is, possible, that, his, uncle, himself, a, chancellor, of, the, university, and, the, prior, of, the, monastery, of, santa, cruz, instructed, him, or, that, he, studied, at, the, monastery, college, at, about, twenty, years, of, age, he, probably, moved, to, lisbon, before, completing, his, studies, his, family, was, poor, but, being, noble, he, could, be, admitted, to, the, court, of, john, iii, where, he, established, fruitful, intellectual, contacts, and, began, his, career, as, a, poet, it, was, suggested, that, he, earned, his, living, as, a, preceptor, of, francisco, son, of, the, count, of, linhares, d, ant, nio, de, noronha, but, this, now, seems, hardly, plausible, it, is, also, said, that, he, adopted, a, bohemian, lifestyle, frequenting, taverns, and, getting, involved, in, tumultuous, love, affairs, several, ladies, are, cited, by, name, in, late, biographies, of, the, poet, as, having, been, the, object, of, his, affection, but, those, identifications, are, currently, considered, apocryphal, additions, to, his, legend, among, them, for, example, there, was, talk, of, a, passion, for, infanta, dona, maria, sister, of, the, king, but, that, audacity, would, have, earned, him, time, in, prison, another, was, catarina, de, ata, de, with, whom, he, allegedly, had, a, frustrated, love, affair, that, resulted, in, his, self, exile, first, in, ribatejo, and, then, by, enlisting, as, a, soldier, in, ceuta, the, reason, for, the, latter, trip, is, doubtful, but, the, trip, itself, is, accepted, fact, he, remained, there, two, years, and, lost, his, right, eye, in, a, naval, battle, in, the, strait, of, gibraltar, back, in, lisbon, he, wasted, no, time, in, resuming, his, bohemian, life, a, document, dating, from, 1550, states, that, he, had, enlisted, to, travel, to, india, lu, s, de, cam, es, son, of, sim, o, vaz, and, ana, de, s, living, in, lisbon, at, mouraria, squire, 25, years, old, ginger, bearded, brought, his, father, as, guarantor, goes, on, the, ship, of, s, pedro, dos, burgaleses, among, the, men, at, arms, as, it, turns, out, he, didn, t, board, immediately, in, a, corpus, christi, procession, he, got, into, an, altercation, with, a, certain, gon, alo, borges, employee, of, the, royal, palace, and, wounded, him, with, a, sword, sentenced, to, prison, he, later, received, a, letter, of, pardon, and, was, released, by, royal, order, on, 7, march, 1553, which, says, he, is, a, young, man, and, poor, and, he, is, going, to, serve, in, india, this, year, manuel, de, faria, e, sousa, found, in, the, registers, of, the, armada, of, india, for, that, year, 1553, under, the, title, gente, de, guerra, men, of, war, the, following, statement, fernando, casado, son, of, manuel, casado, and, branca, queimada, residents, of, lisbon, squire, lu, s, de, cam, es, son, of, sim, o, vaz, and, ana, de, s, squire, took, his, place, and, he, received, 2400, like, the, others, cam, es, set, sail, on, palm, sunday, the, 24th, of, march, 1553, his, last, words, he, says, in, a, letter, were, those, of, scipio, africanus, ingrata, patria, non, possidebis, ossa, mea, ungrateful, fatherland, you, will, not, possess, my, bones, he, traveled, aboard, the, carrack, s, o, bento, belonging, to, the, fleet, of, fern, o, lvares, cabral, which, left, the, tagus, on, march, 24, 1553, during, the, trip, he, passed, through, the, regions, where, vasco, da, gama, had, sailed, faced, a, storm, in, the, cape, of, good, hope, cabo, da, boa, esperan, a, where, the, three, other, ships, in, the, fleet, were, lost, and, landed, in, goa, in, 1554, soon, he, enlisted, in, the, service, of, the, viceroy, d, afonso, de, noronha, and, fought, in, the, expedition, against, the, king, of, chemb, or, da, pimenta, in, 1555, noronha, s, successor, d, pedro, mascarenhas, ordered, manuel, de, vasconcelos, to, fight, the, moors, in, the, red, sea, cam, es, accompanied, him, but, the, squadron, did, not, find, the, enemy, and, went, to, winter, in, ormuz, in, the, persian, gulf, probably, at, this, time, he, had, already, started, writing, os, lus, adas, when, he, returned, to, goa, in, 1556, he, met, d, francisco, barreto, in, the, government, and, composed, for, him, the, auto, de, filodemo, which, suggests, that, barreto, looked, upon, cam, es, with, favor, the, early, biographers, however, differ, about, cam, es, relations, with, that, ruler, at, the, same, time, an, anonymous, satire, criticizing, the, prevalence, of, immorality, and, corruption, which, was, attributed, to, cam, es, also, was, published, since, satires, were, condemned, by, the, ordinances, of, king, manuel, cam, es, would, have, been, arrested, for, that, but, it, has, also, been, hypothesized, that, the, arrest, was, actually, for, debts, that, cam, es, had, incurred, it, is, possible, that, he, remained, in, prison, until, 1561, and, that, he, may, have, been, convicted, of, additional, offenses, before, then, at, any, rate, when, d, francisco, coutinho, assumed, the, governorship, of, india, cam, es, was, released, and, came, under, that, man, s, employ, and, protection, he, was, appointed, to, the, position, of, superintendent, for, the, dead, and, missing, for, macau, in, 1562, serving, de, facto, from, 1563, until, 1564, or, 1565, at, that, time, macau, was, a, trading, post, still, in, formation, and, almost, uninhabited, tradition, says, that, there, he, wrote, part, of, os, lus, adas, in, a, cave, which, later, was, named, after, him, on, the, trip, back, to, goa, he, was, shipwrecked, as, tradition, says, near, the, mouth, of, the, mekong, river, managing, to, save, only, himself, and, the, manuscript, of, os, lus, adas, an, event, that, inspired, the, famous, redondilha, sobre, os, rios, que, v, o, considered, by, ant, nio, s, rgio, the, backbone, of, the, camonian, lyric, as, is, repeatedly, cited, in, the, critical, literature, the, trauma, of, the, shipwreck, in, the, words, of, leal, de, matos, had, the, most, profound, impact, on, redefining, the, themes, of, os, lus, adas, this, being, noticeable, beginning, with, canto, vii, a, fact, already, noted, by, diogo, do, couto, a, friend, of, the, poet, who, partly, accompanied, the, work, as, it, was, being, written, his, rescue, took, months, to, occur, and, there, is, no, record, of, how, it, happened, but, he, was, taken, to, malacca, where, he, received, a, new, arrest, warrant, for, misappropriating, the, assets, of, the, dead, that, had, been, entrusted, to, him, the, exact, date, of, his, return, to, goa, is, not, known, but, he, may, have, remained, in, prison, there, for, some, time, couto, says, that, in, the, shipwreck, dinamene, a, chinese, maiden, with, whom, cam, es, had, fallen, in, love, died, but, ribeiro, and, others, reject, that, story, the, next, viceroy, d, ant, o, de, noronha, was, a, longtime, friend, of, cam, es, having, first, met, him, during, his, morocco, adventure, certain, biographers, claim, that, he, was, promised, a, position, at, the, trading, post, at, chaul, but, he, did, not, take, up, the, position, severim, de, faria, said, that, the, final, years, spent, in, goa, were, occupied, with, poetry, and, military, activities, where, he, always, showed, bravery, readiness, and, loyalty, to, the, crown, it, is, difficult, to, determine, what, his, daily, life, in, the, east, would, have, been, like, beyond, what, can, be, extrapolated, from, his, military, status, it, seems, certain, that, he, always, lived, modestly, and, may, have, shared, a, house, with, friends, in, one, of, those, collective, dwellings, where, it, was, customary, for, people, from, the, homeland, to, associate, as, ramalho, notes, some, of, these, friends, must, have, been, in, possession, of, a, certain, degree, of, culture, and, would, have, provided, illustrious, companionship, ribeiro, saraiva, and, moura, admit, that, he, may, have, encountered, among, other, figures, fern, o, mendes, pinto, fern, o, vaz, dourado, fern, o, lvares, do, oriente, garcia, de, orta, and, the, aforementioned, diogo, do, couto, creating, opportunities, for, debating, literary, topics, and, the, like, he, may, also, have, attended, lectures, at, one, of, goa, s, colleges, or, religious, establishments, ribeiro, adds, that, at, such, meetings, the, participants, were, both, men, at, arms, and, men, of, letters, and, were, in, search, not, only, of, military, success, and, material, fortune, but, also, of, the, fame, and, glory, born, of, culture, this, was, one, of, the, great, aspirations, of, the, humanism, of, that, era, and, from, it, may, have, sprung, the, idea, of, creating, an, academy, reproducing, within, the, limitations, of, the, local, context, the, model, of, renaissance, academies, such, as, the, one, founded, in, florence, by, marsilio, ficino, and, his, circle, where, neoplatonic, ideals, were, cultivated, whether, it, was, by, invitation, or, simply, a, matter, of, taking, the, chance, to, bridge, part, of, the, distance, that, separated, him, from, his, homeland, it, is, not, known, for, certain, but, in, december, 1567, cam, es, embarked, on, pedro, barreto, s, ship, to, sofala, on, the, island, of, mozambique, where, barreto, had, been, appointed, governor, and, there, cam, es, would, wait, for, transport, to, lisbon, at, a, future, date, the, early, biographers, say, that, pedro, barreto, was, treacherous, making, false, promises, to, cam, es, so, that, after, two, years, diogo, do, couto, found, him, in, a, precarious, state, while, attempting, to, set, sail, with, couto, cam, es, found, his, departure, embargoed, in, the, amount, of, two, hundred, cruzados, by, barreto, demanding, reimbursement, for, monies, spent, on, the, poet, s, behalf, his, friends, however, collected, the, amount, and, cam, es, was, released, arriving, in, cascais, aboard, the, carrack, santa, clara, on, april, 7, 1570, after, so, many, adventures, he, finally, completed, os, lus, adas, presenting, them, in, recitation, to, sebastian, the, king, still, a, teenager, ordered, the, work, to, be, published, in, 1572, also, granting, a, small, pension, to, lu, s, de, cam, es, noble, knight, of, my, house, in, payment, for, services, rendered, in, india, the, value, of, the, pension, did, not, exceed, fifteen, thousand, r, is, a, year, which, if, not, generous, was, also, not, as, miserly, as, has, been, suggested, considering, that, the, royal, palace, s, ladies, in, waiting, received, around, ten, thousand, r, is, for, a, veteran, soldier, the, sum, must, have, been, considered, sufficient, and, honorable, at, the, time, but, the, pension, would, ve, only, lasted, for, three, years, and, although, the, grant, was, renewable, it, seems, that, it, was, paid, irregularly, causing, the, poet, to, experience, material, difficulties, cam, es, lived, out, his, final, years, in, a, room, in, a, house, near, the, convent, of, santa, ana, in, a, state, according, to, tradition, of, the, most, unworthy, poverty, without, a, rag, to, cover, him, le, gentil, considered, this, view, a, romantic, exaggeration, as, he, was, still, able, to, keep, a, slave, named, jau, whom, he, had, brought, with, him, from, the, east, and, official, documents, attest, that, he, had, some, means, of, livelihood, after, being, embittered, by, the, portuguese, defeat, at, the, battle, of, alc, cer, quibir, in, which, sebastian, disappeared, leading, portugal, to, lose, its, independence, to, the, spanish, crown, he, was, stricken, by, bubonic, plague, according, to, le, gentil, he, was, transported, to, a, hospital, and, died, on, june, 10, 1580, being, buried, according, to, faria, e, sousa, in, a, shallow, grave, in, the, convent, of, santa, ana, or, in, the, cemetery, of, the, poor, in, the, same, hospital, according, to, te, filo, braga, his, mother, having, survived, him, began, to, receive, his, pension, as, an, inheritance, the, receipts, found, at, torre, do, tombo, the, portuguese, national, archive, document, the, date, of, the, poet, s, death, although, an, epitaph, written, by, d, gon, alo, coutinho, has, been, preserved, which, mistakenly, assigns, his, death, to, the, year, 1579, after, the, 1755, earthquake, which, destroyed, most, of, lisbon, attempts, were, made, to, find, the, remains, of, cam, es, but, to, no, avail, the, bones, deposited, in, 1880, in, a, tomb, in, the, jer, nimos, monastery, are, in, all, probability, someone, else, s, the, testimonies, of, his, contemporaries, describe, him, as, a, man, of, average, size, with, reddish, blond, hair, blind, in, his, right, eye, skilled, in, all, physical, exercises, and, with, a, temperamental, disposition, having, little, difficulty, in, engaging, in, fights, it, is, said, that, he, had, great, value, as, a, soldier, exhibiting, courage, combativeness, a, sense, of, honor, and, willingness, to, serve, a, good, companion, in, his, spare, time, liberal, cheerful, and, witty, when, the, blows, of, fortune, did, not, overwhelm, his, spirit, and, sadden, him, he, was, aware, of, his, merit, as, a, man, as, a, soldier, and, as, a, poet, all, efforts, made, to, discover, the, definitive, identity, of, his, muse, were, in, vain, and, several, contradictory, proposals, were, made, about, alleged, women, present, in, his, life, cam, es, himself, suggested, in, one, of, his, poems, that, there, were, several, muses, to, inspire, him, when, he, said, in, various, flames, it, was, often, burning, the, names, of, ladies, supposed, to, have, been, his, loved, ones, that, appear, in, his, poems, are, always, used, generically, and, can, therefore, be, ideal, figures, no, mention, of, any, ladies, identifiable, by, name, is, given, in, the, poet, s, first, biographies, those, of, pedro, de, mariz, and, that, of, severim, de, faria, who, only, collected, rumors, about, some, loves, in, pa, o, da, rainha, the, queen, s, household, reference, to, catarina, de, ata, de, only, appeared, in, the, edition, of, rimas, de, faria, e, sousa, in, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, and, to, the, infanta, on, jos, maria, rodrigues, which, was, only, published, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, celebrated, dinamene, also, appears, to, be, a, poetic, image, rather, than, a, real, person, ribeiro, proposed, several, alternatives, to, explain, it, the, name, might, have, been, a, cryptonym, of, dona, joana, meneses, dina, d, ioana, mene, one, of, his, possible, loves, who, died, on, the, way, to, the, indies, and, was, buried, in, the, sea, daughter, of, violante, countess, of, linhares, whom, he, would, also, have, loved, in, portugal, and, pointed, out, the, occurrence, of, the, name, dinamene, in, poems, written, probably, around, the, arrival, in, india, before, proceeding, to, china, where, it, is, said, that, he, would, have, found, the, girl, he, also, referred, to, the, opinion, of, researchers, who, claim, the, mention, of, couto, the, only, primitive, reference, to, the, chinese, outside, of, the, camonian, work, itself, to, have, been, falsified, being, introduced, a, posteriori, with, the, possibility, that, it, is, even, a, spelling, error, a, corruption, of, dignamente, worthily, in, the, final, version, of, couto, s, manuscript, the, name, would, not, even, have, been, cited, even, though, proving, it, is, difficult, with, the, disappearance, of, the, manuscript, probably, executed, between, 1573, and, 1575, the, so, called, portrait, painted, in, red, illustrated, at, the, opening, of, the, article, is, considered, by, vasco, gra, a, moura, as, the, only, and, precious, reliable, document, we, have, to, know, the, features, of, the, epic, portrayed, in, life, by, a, professional, painter, what, is, known, of, this, portrait, is, a, copy, made, at, the, request, of, the, 3rd, duke, of, laf, es, executed, by, lu, s, jos, pereira, de, resende, between, 1819, and, 1844, from, the, original, that, was, found, in, a, green, silk, bag, in, the, rubble, of, the, fire, at, the, palace, of, the, counts, of, ericeira, which, has, since, disappeared, it, is, a, very, faithful, copy, that, ue, to, the, restricted, dimensions, of, the, drawing, the, texture, of, the, blood, creating, spots, of, distribution, of, values, the, rigor, of, the, contours, and, the, definition, of, the, contrasted, planes, the, reticulated, neutral, that, harmonizes, the, background, and, highlights, the, bust, of, the, portrait, the, type, of, the, wrap, around, limits, from, which, the, enlightening, signature, runs, down, in, short, the, symbolic, apparatus, of, the, image, captured, in, the, pose, of, a, graphic, book, illustration, was, intended, for, the, opening, of, an, engraving, on, a, copper, plate, to, illustrate, one, of, the, first, editions, of, the, lusiads, also, surviving, is, a, miniature, painted, in, india, in, 1581, by, order, of, fern, o, teles, de, meneses, and, offered, to, the, viceroy, d, lu, s, de, ata, de, who, according, to, testimonies, of, the, time, was, very, similar, to, him, in, appearance, another, portrait, was, found, in, the, 1970s, by, maria, antonieta, de, azevedo, dated, 1556, and, showing, the, poet, in, prison, the, first, medal, with, its, effigy, appeared, in, 1782, ordered, to, mint, by, the, baron, of, dillon, in, england, where, cam, es, is, crowned, with, laurels, and, dressed, in, coat, of, arms, with, the, inscription, apollo, portuguez, honor, de, hespanha, nasceo, 1524, morreo, 1579, in, 1793, a, reproduction, of, this, medal, was, coined, in, portugal, by, order, of, tom, s, jos, de, aquino, librarian, of, the, real, mesa, cens, ria, over, the, centuries, the, image, of, cam, es, was, represented, numerous, times, in, engraving, painting, and, sculpture, by, portuguese, and, foreign, artists, and, several, monuments, were, erected, in, his, honor, notably, the, great, monument, to, cam, es, installed, in, 1867, in, pra, a, de, lu, s, de, cam, es, in, lisbon, by, victor, bastos, which, is, the, center, of, official, public, ceremonies, and, popular, demonstrations, he, was, also, honored, in, musical, compositions, appeared, with, his, effigy, on, medals, currency, notes, stamps, and, coins, and, as, a, character, in, novels, poetry, and, plays, the, film, cam, es, directed, by, jos, leit, o, de, barros, was, the, first, portuguese, film, to, participate, in, the, cannes, film, festival, in, 1946, among, the, famous, artists, who, took, him, as, a, model, for, his, works, are, bordalo, pinheiro, jos, sim, es, de, almeida, francisco, augusto, metrass, ant, nio, soares, dos, reis, horace, vernet, jos, malhoa, vieira, portuense, domingos, sequeira, and, lagoa, henriques, a, crater, on, the, planet, mercury, and, an, asteroid, in, the, main, belt, were, named, after, him, cam, es, lived, in, the, final, phase, of, the, european, renaissance, a, period, marked, by, many, changes, in, culture, and, society, which, mark, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, and, the, beginning, of, the, modern, age, and, the, transition, from, feudalism, to, capitalism, it, was, called, renaissance, due, to, the, rediscovery, and, revaluation, of, the, cultural, references, of, classical, antiquity, which, guided, the, changes, of, this, period, towards, a, humanist, and, naturalist, ideal, that, affirmed, the, dignity, of, man, placing, him, at, the, center, of, the, universe, making, him, the, researcher, par, excellence, of, nature, and, promoting, reason, and, science, as, arbitrators, of, manifest, life, during, this, period, several, scientific, instruments, were, invented, and, several, natural, laws, and, physical, entities, previously, unknown, were, discovered, the, knowledge, of, the, face, of, the, planet, itself, changed, after, the, discoveries, of, the, great, navigations, the, spirit, of, intellectual, speculation, and, scientific, research, was, on, the, rise, causing, physics, mathematics, medicine, astronomy, philosophy, engineering, philology, and, several, other, branches, of, knowledge, to, reach, a, level, of, complexity, efficiency, and, accuracy, unprecedented, which, led, to, an, optimistic, conception, of, human, history, as, a, continuous, expansion, and, always, for, the, better, in, a, way, the, renaissance, was, an, original, and, eclectic, attempt, to, harmonize, pagan, neoplatonism, with, the, christian, religion, eros, with, charitas, together, with, oriental, jewish, and, arab, influences, and, where, the, study, of, magic, astrology, and, the, occult, was, not, absent, it, was, also, the, time, when, strong, national, states, began, to, be, created, commerce, and, cities, expanded, and, the, bourgeoisie, became, a, force, of, great, social, and, economic, importance, contrasting, with, the, relative, decline, in, the, influence, of, religion, in, world, affairs, in, the, 16th, century, the, time, in, which, cam, es, lived, the, influence, of, the, italian, renaissance, expanded, throughout, europe, however, several, of, its, most, typical, features, were, declining, in, particular, because, of, a, series, of, political, disputes, and, wars, that, altered, the, european, political, map, with, italy, losing, its, place, as, a, power, and, the, split, of, catholicism, with, the, emergence, of, the, protestant, reformation, in, the, catholic, reaction, counter, reformation, was, launched, the, inquisition, was, reactivated, and, ecclesiastical, censorship, was, rekindled, at, the, same, time, machiavelli, s, doctrines, became, widespread, dissociating, ethics, from, the, practice, of, power, the, result, was, the, reaffirmation, of, the, power, of, religion, over, the, profane, world, and, the, formation, of, an, agitated, spiritual, political, social, and, intellectual, atmosphere, with, strong, doses, of, pessimism, reverberating, unfavorably, on, the, former, freedom, that, artists, enjoyed, despite, this, the, intellectual, and, artistic, acquisitions, of, the, high, renaissance, that, were, still, fresh, and, shining, before, the, eyes, could, not, be, forgotten, immediately, even, if, their, philosophical, substrate, could, no, longer, remain, valid, in, the, face, of, new, political, religious, and, social, facts, the, new, art, that, was, made, although, inspired, by, the, source, of, classicism, translated, it, into, restless, anxious, distorted, ambivalent, forms, attached, to, intellectualist, preciosities, characteristics, that, reflected, the, dilemmas, of, the, century, and, define, the, general, style, of, this, phase, as, mannerist, since, the, middle, of, the, 15th, century, portugal, had, established, itself, as, a, great, naval, and, commercial, power, its, arts, were, developing, and, enthusiasm, for, maritime, conquests, was, boiling, the, reign, of, d, jo, o, ii, was, marked, by, the, formation, of, a, feeling, of, national, pride, and, in, the, time, of, d, manuel, i, as, spina, bechara, say, pride, had, given, way, to, delirium, to, the, pure, euphoria, of, world, domination, at, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, garcia, de, resende, lamented, that, there, was, no, one, who, could, celebrate, so, many, feats, worthily, claiming, that, there, was, epic, material, superior, to, that, of, the, romans, and, trojans, filling, this, gap, jo, o, de, barros, wrote, his, cavalry, novel, a, cr, nica, do, imperador, clarimundo, 1520, in, epic, format, shortly, thereafter, ant, nio, ferreira, appeared, establishing, himself, as, a, mentor, of, the, classicist, generation, and, challenging, his, contemporaries, to, sing, the, glories, of, portugal, in, high, style, when, cam, es, appeared, the, land, was, prepared, for, the, apotheosis, of, the, homeland, a, homeland, that, had, fought, hard, to, conquer, its, sovereignty, first, of, the, moors, and, after, castile, had, developed, an, adventurous, spirit, that, had, taken, it, across, the, oceans, expanding, the, known, borders, of, the, world, and, opening, new, routes, of, trade, and, exploration, defeating, enemy, armies, and, the, hostile, forces, of, nature, but, at, this, point, however, the, political, and, cultural, crisis, was, already, being, announced, materializing, shortly, after, his, death, when, the, country, lost, its, sovereignty, to, spain, cam, es, production, is, divided, into, three, genres, lyrical, epic, and, theatrical, his, lyrical, work, was, immediately, appreciated, as, a, high, achievement, he, demonstrated, his, virtuosity, especially, in, cantos, and, elegies, but, his, redondilhas, are, not, far, behind, in, fact, he, was, a, master, in, this, form, giving, new, life, to, the, art, of, gloss, instilling, in, it, spontaneity, and, simplicity, a, delicate, irony, and, a, lively, phrasing, taking, courtesan, poetry, to, its, highest, level, and, showing, that, he, also, knew, how, to, express, perfectly, joy, and, relaxation, his, epic, production, is, synthesized, in, os, lus, adas, an, intense, glorification, of, portuguese, feats, not, only, of, his, military, victories, but, also, the, conquest, over, elements, and, physical, space, with, recurring, use, of, classic, allegories, the, idea, of, a, national, epic, had, existed, in, the, portuguese, heart, since, the, 15th, century, when, the, navigations, started, but, it, was, up, to, cam, es, in, the, following, century, to, materialize, it, in, his, dramatic, works, he, sought, to, fuse, nationalist, and, classic, elements, probably, if, he, had, remained, in, portugal, as, a, courtly, poet, he, would, never, have, achieved, the, mastery, of, his, art, the, experiences, he, accumulated, as, a, soldier, and, navigator, enriched, his, worldview, and, excited, his, talent, through, them, he, managed, to, free, himself, from, the, formal, limitations, of, courtesan, poetry, and, the, difficulties, he, went, through, the, profound, anguish, of, exile, the, longing, for, his, country, indelibly, impregnated, his, spirit, and, communicated, with, his, work, and, from, there, influenced, in, a, marked, way, subsequent, generations, of, portuguese, writers, his, best, poems, shine, exactly, for, what, is, genuine, in, the, suffering, expressed, and, the, honesty, of, that, expression, and, this, is, one, of, the, main, reasons, that, put, his, poetry, at, such, a, high, level, its, sources, were, numerous, he, dominated, latin, and, spanish, and, demonstrated, a, solid, knowledge, of, greco, roman, mythology, ancient, and, modern, european, history, portuguese, chroniclers, and, classical, literature, with, authors, such, as, ovid, xenophon, lucan, valerius, flaccus, horace, standing, out, but, especially, homer, and, virgil, from, whom, he, borrowed, various, structural, and, stylistic, elements, and, sometimes, even, passages, in, almost, literal, transcription, according, to, his, quotations, he, also, seems, to, have, had, a, good, knowledge, of, works, by, ptolemy, diogenes, la, rtius, pliny, the, elder, strabo, and, pomponius, mela, among, other, historians, and, ancient, scientists, among, the, moderns, he, was, aware, of, the, italian, production, of, francesco, petrarca, ludovico, ariosto, torquato, tasso, giovanni, boccaccio, and, jacopo, sannazaro, and, of, castilian, literature, for, those, who, consider, the, renaissance, to, be, a, homogeneous, historical, period, informed, by, classical, ideals, and, extending, to, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, cam, es, is, quite, simply, a, renaissance, poet, but, in, general, it, is, recognized, that, the, 16th, century, was, largely, dominated, by, a, stylistic, derivation, called, mannerism, which, at, various, points, is, an, anti, classical, school, and, in, many, ways, prefigures, the, baroque, thus, for, many, authors, it, is, more, appropriate, to, describe, the, camonian, style, as, mannerist, distinguishing, it, from, typical, renaissance, classicism, this, is, justified, by, the, presence, of, several, language, resources, and, an, approach, to, its, themes, that, are, not, in, agreement, with, the, doctrines, of, balance, economy, tranquility, harmony, unity, and, invariable, idealism, which, are, the, fundamental, axes, of, renaissance, classicism, cam, es, after, a, typically, classic, initial, phase, moved, on, to, other, paths, and, anxiety, and, drama, became, his, companions, throughout, the, lusiads, the, signs, of, a, political, and, spiritual, crisis, are, visible, the, prospect, of, the, decline, of, the, empire, and, the, character, of, the, portuguese, remains, in, the, air, censored, by, bad, customs, and, the, lack, of, appreciation, for, the, arts, alternating, with, excerpts, in, which, its, enthusiastic, apology, they, are, also, typical, of, mannerism, and, would, become, even, more, baroque, the, taste, for, contrast, for, emotional, flare, for, conflict, for, paradox, for, religious, propaganda, for, the, use, of, complex, figures, of, speech, and, preciousness, even, for, the, grotesque, and, monstrous, many, of, them, common, features, in, camonian, work, the, mannerist, nature, of, his, work, is, also, marked, by, the, ambiguities, generated, by, the, rupture, with, the, past, and, by, the, concomitant, adherence, to, it, the, first, manifested, in, the, visualization, of, a, new, era, and, in, the, use, of, new, poetic, formulas, from, italy, and, the, second, in, the, use, of, archaisms, typical, of, the, middle, ages, along, with, the, use, of, formal, renaissance, and, classicist, models, he, cultivated, the, medieval, genres, of, vilancete, cantiga, and, trova, for, joaquim, dos, santos, the, contradictory, character, of, his, poetry, is, found, in, the, contrast, between, two, opposing, premises, idealism, and, practical, experience, he, combined, typical, values, of, humanist, rationalism, with, other, derivatives, of, cavalry, crusades, and, feudalism, aligned, the, constant, propaganda, of, the, catholic, faith, with, ancient, mythology, responsible, in, the, aesthetic, plan, for, all, the, action, that, materializes, the, final, realization, discarding, the, mediocre, aurea, dear, to, classics, to, advocate, the, primacy, of, the, exercise, of, weapons, and, the, glorious, conquest, os, lus, adas, or, the, lusiads, is, considered, the, portuguese, epic, par, excellence, the, title, itself, already, suggests, its, nationalist, intentions, being, derived, from, the, ancient, roman, denomination, of, portugal, lusitania, it, is, one, of, the, most, important, epics, of, the, modern, age, due, to, its, greatness, and, universality, the, epic, tells, the, story, of, vasco, da, gama, and, the, portuguese, heroes, who, sailed, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, and, opened, a, new, route, to, india, it, is, a, humanist, epic, even, in, its, contradictions, in, the, association, of, pagan, mythology, with, the, christian, view, in, the, opposite, feelings, about, war, and, empire, in, the, taste, of, rest, and, in, the, desire, for, adventure, in, the, appreciation, of, sensual, pleasure, and, in, the, demands, of, an, ethical, life, in, the, perception, of, greatness, and, in, the, presentiment, of, decline, in, the, heroism, paid, for, with,

especially, well, achieved, but, also, by, the, superior, mastery, of, all, the, resources, of, the, language, and, the, art, of, versification, with, a, knowledge, of, a, wide, range, of, styles, used, in, efficient, combination, the, work, is, also, a, serious, warning, for, christian, kings, to, abandon, small, rivalries, and, unite, against, muslim, expansion, the, structure, of, the, work, is, in, itself, worthy, of, interest, as, according, to, jorge, de, sena, nothing, is, arbitrary, in, os, lus, adas, among, the, arguments, he, presented, was, the, use, of, the, golden, section, a, defined, relationship, between, the, parts, and, the, whole, organizing, the, set, in, ideal, proportions, that, emphasize, especially, significant, passages, sena, demonstrated, that, when, applying, the, golden, section, to, the, whole, work, it, falls, precisely, on, the, verse, that, describes, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, in, india, applying, the, separate, section, to, the, two, resulting, parts, in, the, first, part, comes, the, episode, that, reports, the, death, of, in, s, de, castro, and, in, the, second, the, stanza, that, narrates, cupid, s, efforts, to, unite, the, portuguese, and, the, nymphs, which, for, sena, reinforces, the, importance, of, love, throughout, the, composition, two, other, elements, give, os, lus, adas, its, modernity, and, distance, it, from, classicism, the, introduction, of, doubt, contradiction, and, questioning, in, disagreement, with, the, affirmative, certainty, that, characterizes, the, classic, epic, and, the, primacy, of, rhetoric, over, action, replacing, the, world, of, facts, with, that, of, words, which, do, not, fully, recover, reality, and, evolve, into, metalanguage, with, the, same, disruptive, effect, on, the, traditional, epic, according, to, costa, pimp, o, there, is, no, evidence, that, cam, es, intended, to, write, his, epic, before, he, traveled, to, india, although, heroic, themes, were, already, present, in, his, previous, production, it, is, possible, that, he, drew, some, inspiration, from, fragments, of, the, decades, of, asia, by, jo, o, de, barros, and, the, history, of, the, discovery, and, conquest, of, india, by, the, portuguese, by, fern, o, lopes, de, castanheda, he, was, certainly, well, informed, on, classical, mythology, before, that, as, well, as, on, ancient, epic, literature, apparently, the, poem, started, to, take, shape, as, early, as, 1554, with, storck, considering, that, his, determination, to, write, it, was, born, during, the, sea, voyage, itself, he, was, seen, working, on, it, in, mozambique, by, his, friend, historian, diogo, do, couto, between, 1568, and, 1569, the, success, of, the, publication, of, os, lus, adas, supposedly, required, a, second, edition, in, the, same, year, as, the, princeps, edition, the, two, differ, in, countless, details, and, it, was, debated, at, length, which, one, would, in, fact, be, the, original, nor, is, it, clear, to, whom, the, amendments, to, the, second, text, are, due, currently, the, edition, that, shows, the, publisher, s, brand, a, pelican, with, its, neck, turned, to, the, left, which, is, called, edition, a, carried, out, under, the, supervision, of, the, author, is, recognized, as, original, however, edition, b, was, for, a, long, time, taken, as, princeps, with, disastrous, consequences, for, the, later, critical, analysis, of, the, work, apparently, edition, b, was, produced, later, around, 1584, or, 1585, in, a, clandestine, manner, taking, the, fictitious, date, of, 1572, to, bypass, the, delays, of, censorship, of, the, time, if, it, were, published, as, a, new, edition, and, to, correct, the, serious, defects, of, another, 1584, edition, the, so, called, piscos, edition, however, maria, helena, paiva, raised, the, hypothesis, that, editions, a, and, b, are, only, variants, of, the, same, edition, which, was, corrected, after, the, typographic, composition, but, while, printing, was, already, in, progress, according, to, the, researcher, the, need, to, make, the, most, of, the, press, led, to, the, conclusion, that, after, printing, a, shape, which, consisted, of, several, folios, a, first, test, was, taken, which, was, corrected, while, the, press, continued, now, with, the, corrected, text, there, were, therefore, uncorrected, printed, folios, and, corrected, printed, folios, which, were, grouped, indistinctly, in, the, same, copy, so, that, there, were, no, two, copies, exactly, the, same, in, the, press, system, of, that, time, cam, es, lyric, work, dispersed, in, manuscripts, was, collected, and, published, posthumously, in, 1595, under, the, title, rimas, rhymes, throughout, the, 17th, century, the, growing, prestige, of, his, epic, contributed, to, raise, the, appreciation, for, these, other, poems, even, more, the, collection, includes, redondilhas, odes, glosses, cantigas, twists, or, variations, sextilhas, sonnets, elegies, eclogues, and, other, small, stanzas, his, lyrical, poetry, comes, from, several, different, sources, the, sonnets, generally, follow, the, italian, style, derived, from, petrarch, the, songs, took, the, model, of, petrarch, and, pietro, bembo, in, the, odes, the, influence, of, the, troubadour, poetry, of, chivalry, and, classical, poetry, is, verified, but, with, a, more, refined, style, in, the, sextilhas, the, proven, al, influence, is, clear, in, the, redondilhas, it, expanded, the, form, deepened, the, lyricism, and, introduced, a, theme, worked, on, antitheses, and, paradoxes, unknown, in, the, old, tradition, of, cantigas, de, amigo, and, the, elegies, are, quite, classicist, its, resorts, follow, an, epistolary, style, with, moralizing, themes, eclogues, are, perfect, pieces, of, the, pastoral, genre, derived, from, virgil, and, the, italians, the, influence, of, spanish, poetry, by, garcilaso, de, la, vega, jorge, de, montemor, juan, bosc, n, gregorio, silvestre, and, several, other, names, was, also, detected, in, many, points, of, his, lyric, as, his, commentator, faria, e, sousa, pointed, out, despite, the, care, of, the, first, editor, of, rimas, fern, o, rodrigues, lobo, soropita, in, the, 1595, edition, several, apocryphal, poems, were, included, many, poems, were, discovered, over, the, next, few, centuries, and, attributed, to, him, but, not, always, with, careful, critical, analysis, the, result, was, that, for, example, while, in, the, original, rhymes, there, were, 65, sonnets, in, the, 1861, edition, of, juromenha, there, were, 352, in, the, 1953, edition, of, aguiar, e, silva, 166, pieces, were, still, listed, in, addition, many, editions, modernized, or, embellished, the, original, text, a, practice, that, was, particularly, pronounced, after, the, 1685, edition, of, faria, e, sousa, giving, rise, to, and, rooting, a, tradition, of, its, own, in, this, adulterated, lesson, that, caused, enormous, difficulties, for, critical, study, more, scientific, studies, only, began, to, be, undertaken, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, with, the, contribution, of, wilhelm, storck, and, carolina, micha, lis, de, vasconcelos, who, discarded, several, apocryphal, compositions, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, work, continued, with, jos, maria, rodrigues, and, afonso, lopes, vieira, who, published, rimas, in, 1932, in, an, edition, they, called, cr, tica, criticism, although, it, did, not, deserve, the, name, it, adopted, large, parts, of, faria, and, sousa, s, lesson, but, editors, claimed, to, have, used, the, original, editions, from, 1595, and, 1598, on, the, other, hand, they, definitely, raised, the, issue, of, textual, fraud, that, had, been, perpetuating, for, a, long, time, and, had, tampered, with, the, poems, to, the, point, of, becoming, unrecognizable, one, example, is, enough, it, seems, impossible, to, reach, a, definitive, result, in, this, purge, however, enough, authentic, material, survives, to, guarantee, his, position, as, the, best, portuguese, lyricist, and, the, greatest, renaissance, poet, in, portugal, the, general, content, of, his, works, for, the, stage, combines, in, the, same, way, as, in, os, lus, adas, nationalism, and, classic, inspiration, his, production, in, this, field, is, limited, to, three, works, all, in, the, genre, of, comedy, and, in, the, format, of, self, el, rei, seleuco, filodemo, and, anfitri, es, the, attribution, of, el, rei, seleuco, to, cam, es, however, is, controversial, its, existence, was, not, known, until, 1654, when, it, appeared, published, in, the, first, part, of, rimas, in, the, craesbeeck, edition, which, gave, no, details, about, its, origin, and, had, little, care, in, editing, the, text, the, play, also, differs, in, several, aspects, from, the, other, two, that, survived, such, as, its, much, shorter, length, an, act, the, existence, of, a, prologue, in, prose, and, the, less, profound, and, less, erudite, treatment, of, the, love, theme, the, theme, of, the, complicated, passion, of, antiochus, son, of, king, seleucus, i, nicator, for, his, stepmother, queen, estratonice, was, taken, from, a, historical, fact, from, antiquity, transmitted, by, plutarch, and, repeated, by, petrarch, and, the, spanish, popular, songwriter, working, it, in, the, style, by, gil, vicente, anfitri, es, published, in, 1587, is, an, adaptation, of, plautus, amphitryon, where, it, emphasizes, the, comic, character, of, the, amphitryon, myth, highlighting, the, omnipotence, of, love, which, subdues, even, the, immortals, also, following, the, vincentian, tradition, the, play, was, written, in, smaller, redondilhas, and, uses, bilingualism, using, castilian, in, the, lines, of, the, character, s, sia, a, slave, to, mark, his, low, social, level, in, passages, that, reach, the, grotesque, a, feature, that, appears, in, the, other, pieces, as, well, filodemo, composed, in, india, and, dedicated, to, the, viceroy, d, francisco, barreto, is, a, comedy, of, morality, in, five, acts, according, to, the, classical, division, being, of, the, three, the, one, that, remained, most, alive, in, the, interest, of, the, critic, due, to, the, multiplicity, of, human, experiences, it, describes, and, for, the, sharpness, of, psychological, observation, the, theme, is, about, the, love, of, a, servant, filodemo, for, the, daughter, dionisa, of, the, nobleman, in, the, house, of, the, one, he, serves, with, autobiographical, traits, cam, es, saw, comedy, as, a, secondary, genre, of, interest, only, as, a, diversion, of, circumstance, but, he, achieved, significant, results, by, transferring, the, comicality, of, the, characters, to, the, action, and, refining, the, plot, so, he, pointed, out, a, path, for, the, renewal, of, portuguese, comedy, however, his, suggestion, was, not, followed, by, the, growers, of, the, genus, who, succeeded, him, according, to, monteiro, of, the, great, epic, poets, of, the, west, cam, es, remains, the, least, known, outside, his, homeland, and, his, masterpiece, os, lus, adas, is, the, least, known, of, the, great, poems, in, the, style, however, from, the, time, he, lived, and, throughout, the, centuries, after, cam, es, was, praised, by, several, non, lusophone, luminaries, of, western,
