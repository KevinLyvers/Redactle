weeks, leading, up, to, the, fight, that, he, was, the, rightful, possessor, of, the, name, we, better, touch, gloves, because, this, is, the, only, round, robinson, said, as, the, fighters, were, introduced, at, the, center, of, the, ring, your, name, ain, t, sugar, mine, is, robinson, then, knocked, costner, out, in, 2, minutes, and, 49, seconds, in, june, 1947, after, four, non, title, bouts, robinson, was, scheduled, to, defend, his, title, for, the, first, time, in, a, bout, against, jimmy, doyle, robinson, initially, backed, out, of, the, fight, because, he, had, a, dream, that, he, was, going, to, kill, doyle, a, priest, and, a, minister, convinced, him, to, fight, his, dream, ended, up, becoming, a, reality, on, june, 25, 1947, robinson, dominated, doyle, and, scored, a, decisive, knockout, in, the, eighth, round, that, knocked, doyle, unconscious, and, resulted, in, doyle, s, death, later, that, night, robinson, said, that, the, impact, of, doyle, s, death, was, very, trying, after, doyle, s, death, criminal, charges, were, threatened, against, robinson, in, cleveland, up, to, and, including, murder, though, none, actually, materialized, after, learning, of, doyle, s, intentions, of, using, the, bout, s, money, to, buy, his, mother, a, house, robinson, gave, doyle, s, mother, the, money, from, his, next, four, bouts, so, she, could, purchase, herself, a, home, fulfilling, her, son, s, intention, it, is, stated, in, his, autobiography, that, one, of, the, main, considerations, for, his, move, up, to, middleweight, was, the, increasing, difficulty, he, was, having, in, making, the, 147, lb, 67, kg, welterweight, weight, limit, however, the, move, up, would, also, prove, beneficial, financially, as, the, division, then, contained, some, of, the, biggest, names, in, boxing, vying, for, the, pennsylvania, state, middleweight, title, in, 1950, robinson, defeated, robert, villemain, later, that, year, in, defense, of, that, crown, he, defeated,

legitimate, knockout, loss, in, 95, professional, bouts, lamotta, had, lost, by, knockout, to, billy, fox, earlier, in, his, career, however, that, fight, was, later, ruled, to, have, been, fixed, and, lamotta, was, sanctioned, for, letting, fox, win, that, bout, and, some, of, the, other, bouts, in, the, six, fight, robinson, lamotta, rivalry, was, depicted, in, the, martin, scorsese, film,

robinson, followed, fullmer, around, the, ring, however, in, the, third, round, he, changed, tactics, and, made, fullmer, come, to, him, at, the, start, of, the, fourth, round, robinson, came, out, on, the, attack, and, stunned, fullmer, and, when, fullmer, returned, with, his, own, punches, robinson, traded, with, him, as, opposed, to, clinching, as, he, had, done, in, their, earlier, fight, the, fight, was, fairly, even, after, four, rounds, but, in, the, fifth, robinson, was, able, to, win, the, title, back, for, a, fourth, time, by, knocking, out, fullmer, with, a, lightning, fast, powerful, left, hook, boxing, critics, have, referred, to, the, left, hook, which, knocked, out, fullmer, as, the, perfect, punch, it, marked, the, first, time, in, 44, career, fights, that, fullmer, had, been, knocked, out, and, when, someone, asked, robinson, after, the, fight, how, far, the, left, hook, had, travelled, robinson, replied, i, can, t, say, but, he, got, the, message, later, that, year, he, lost, his, title, to, basilio, in, a, rugged, 15, round, fight, in, front, of, 38, 000, at, yankee, stadium, but, regained, it, for, a, record, fifth, time, when, he, beat, basilio, in, the,
