patanjali, sanskrit, iast, pata, jali, sanskrit, pronunciation, also, called, gonardiya, or, gonikaputra, was, an, author, mystic, and, philosopher, in, ancient, india, he, is, believed, to, be, an, author, and, compiler, of, a, number, of, sanskrit, works, the, greatest, of, these, are, the, yoga, sutras, a, classical, yoga, text, estimates, based, on, analysis, of, his, works, suggests, that, he, may, have, lived, between, the, 2nd, century, bce, and, the, 5th, century, ce, patanjali, is, regarded, as, an, avatar, of, adi, sesha, there, is, speculation, as, to, whether, the, sage, pata, jali, is, the, author, of, all, the, works, attributed, to, him, as, there, are, a, number, of, known, historical, authors, of, the, same, name, a, great, deal, of, scholarship, has, been, devoted, over, the, 20th, century, to, the, issue, of, the, historicity, or, identity, of, this, author, or, these, authors, amongst, the, more, important, authors, called, pata, jali, are, according, to, monier, monier, williams, the, word, pata, jali, is, a, compound, name, from, patta, sanskrit, falling, flying, and, a, j, honor, celebrate, beautiful, or, a, jali, reverence, joining, palms, of, the, hand, many, scholars, including, louis, renou, have, suggested, that, the, pata, jali, who, wrote, on, yoga, was, a, different, person, than, the, patanjali, who, wrote, a, commentary, on, panini, s, grammar, in, 1914, james, wood, proposed, that, they, were, the, same, person, in, 1922, surendranath, dasgupta, presented, a, series, of, arguments, to, tentatively, propose, that, the, famed, grammar, text, and, the, yoga, text, author, may, be, identical, the, view, that, these, were, likely, two, different, authors, is, generally, accepted, but, some, western, scholars, consider, them, as, a, single, entity, some, in, the, indian, tradition, have, held, that, one, pata, jali, wrote, treatises, on, grammar, medicine, and, yoga, this, has, been, memorialised, in, a, verse, by, bhoja, at, the, start, of, his, commentary, on, the, yogasutras, called, r, jam, rttanda, 11th, century, and, the, following, verse, found, in, shivarama, s, 18th, century, text, y, g, na, cittasya, pad, na,

who, removed, the, impurities, of, the, mind, through, yoga, of, speech, through, grammar, and, of, the, body, through, medicine, this, tradition, is, discussed, by, meulenbeld, who, traces, this, relatively, late, idea, back, to, bhoja, 11th, century, who, was, perhaps, influenced, by, a, verse, by, bhart, hari, ca, 5th, century, that, speaks, of, an, expert, in, yoga, medicine, and, grammar, who, however, is, not, named, no, known, sanskrit, text, prior, to, the, 10th, century, states, that, the, one, and, the, same, patanjali, was, behind, all, the, three, treatises, the, sage, pata, jali, is, said, to, have, attained, samadhi, through, yogic, meditation, at, the, brahmapureeswarar, temple, located, at, tirupattur, tamil, nadu, india, jeeva, samadhi, of, sage, patanjali, which, is, now, an, enclosed, meditation, hall, can, be, seen, near, the, brahma, s, shrine, within, brahmapureeswarar, temple, complex, in, the, grammatical, tradition, pata, jali, is, believed, to, have, lived, in, the, second, century, bce, he, wrote, a, mahabhasya, on, panini, s, sutras, in, a, form, that, quoted, the, commentary, of, k, ty, yana, s, v, rttikas, this, is, a, major, influential, work, on, sanskrit, grammar, and, linguistics, the, dating, of, patanjali, and, his, mahabhasya, is, established, by, a, combination, of, evidence, that, from, the, maurya, empire, period, the, historical, events, mentioned, in, the, examples, he, used, to, explain, his, ideas, the, chronology, of, ancient, classical, sanskrit, texts, that, respect, his, teachings, and, the, mention, of, his, text, or, his, name, in, ancient, indian, literature, of, the, three, ancient, grammarians, the, chronological, dating, of, patanjali, to, mid, 2nd, century, b, c, is, considered, as, reasonably, accurate, by, mainstream, scholarship, the, text, influenced, buddhist, grammatical, literature, as, well, as, memoirs, of, travellers, to, india, for, example, the, chinese, pilgrim, i, tsing, mentions, that, the, mahabhasya, is, studied, in, india, and, advanced, scholars, learn, it, in, three, years, self, study, practice, self, study, to, commune, with, your, chosen, divinity, patanjali, yogasutras, ii, 44, in, the, yoga, tradition, pata, jali, is, a, revered, name, this, pata, jali, s, oeuvre, comprises, the, sutras, about, yoga, yogas, tra, and, the, commentary, integral, to, the, sutras, called, the, bh, ya, some, consider, the, sutras, and, the, bha, ya, to, have, had, different, authors, the, commentary, being, ascribed, to, an, editor, skt, vy, sa, according, to, phillipp, maas, the, same, person, named, patanjali, composed, the, sutras, and, the, bh, ya, commentary, radhakrishnan, and, moore, attribute, the, text, to, the, grammarian, pata, jali, dating, it, as, 2nd, century, bce, during, the, maurya, empire, 322, 185, bce, maas, estimates, pata, jali, s, yogasutra, s, date, to, be, about, 400, ce, based, on, tracing, the, commentaries, on, it, published, in, the, first, millennium, ce, edwin, bryant, on, the, other, hand, surveys, the, major, commentators, in, his, translation, of, the, yoga, s, tras, he, states, that, most, scholars, date, the, text, shortly, after, the, turn, of, the, common, era, circa, first, to, second, century, but, that, it, has, been, placed, as, early, as, several, centuries, before, that, bryant, concludes, that, a, number, of, scholars, have, dated, the, yoga, s, tras, as, late, as, the, fourth, or, fifth, century, c, e, but, these, arguments, have, all, been, challenged, and, late, chronology, for, this, patanjali, and, his, text, are, problematic, regarding, his, early, years, the, tamil, saiva, siddhanta, tradition, from, around, 10th, century, ad, holds, that, pata, jali, learned, yoga, along, with, seven, other, disciples, from, the, great, yogic, guru, nandhi, deva, nandi, hinduism, as, stated, in, tirumular, s, tirumandiram, tantra, 1, his, samadhi, is, said, to, be, at, rameswaram, shiva, temple, and, a, shrine, for, him, still, exists, in, the, temple, nandhi, arulpetra, nadharai, naadinom, nandhigal, nalvar, siva, yoga, maamuni, mandru, thozhuda, pata, jali, vyakramar, endrivar, ennodu, thirumoolar,

whether, the, two, works, the, yoga, sutras, and, the, mah, bh, ya, are, by, the, same, author, has, been, the, subject, of, considerable, debate, the, authorship, of, the, two, is, first, attributed, to, the, same, person, in, bhojadeva, s, rajamartanda, a, relatively, late, 10th, century, commentary, on, the, yoga, sutras, as, well, as, several, subsequent, texts, as, for, the, texts, themselves, the, yoga, sutra, iii, 44, cites, a, sutra, as, that, from, patanjali, by, name, but, this, line, itself, is, not, from, the, mah, bh, ya, this, 10th, century, legend, of, single, authorship, is, doubtful, the, literary, styles, and, contents, of, the, yogas, tras, and, the, mah, bh, ya, are, entirely, different, and, the, only, work, on, medicine, attributed, to, pata, jali, is, lost, sources, of, doubt, include, the, lack, of, cross, references, between, the, texts, and, no, mutual, awareness, of, each, other, unlike, other, cases, of, multiple, works, by, later, sanskrit, authors, also, some, elements, in, the, yoga, sutras, may, date, from, as, late, as, the, 4th, century, c, e, but, such, changes, may, be, due, to, divergent, authorship, or, due, to, later, additions, which, are, not, atypical, in, the, oral, tradition, most, scholars, refer, to, both, works, as, by, patanjali, without, meaning, that, they, are, by, the, same, author, in, addition, to, the, mah, bh, ya, and, yoga, s, tras, the, 11th, century, commentary, on, charaka, by, the, bengali, scholar, chakrapani, datta, and, the, 16th, century, text, patanjalicarita, ascribes, to, pata, jali, a, medical, text, called, the, carakapratisa, sk, ta, now, lost, which, is, apparently, a, revision, pratisa, sk, ta, of, the, medical, treatise, by, caraka, while, there, is, a, short, treatise, on, yoga, in, the, medical, work, called, the, carakasa, hit, by, caraka, towards, the, end, of, the, chapter, called, r, rasth, na, it, is, notable, for, not, bearing, much, resemblance, to, the, yoga, s, tras, and, in, fact, presents, a, form, of, eightfold, yoga, that, is, completely, different, from, that, laid, out, by, pata, jali, in, the, yoga, s, tras, and, the, commentary, yogas, trabh, ya, the, yoga, s, tras, of, pata, jali, are, 196, indian, sutras, aphorisms, on, yoga, it, was, the, most, translated, ancient, indian, text, in, the, medieval, era, having, been, translated, into, about, forty, indian, languages, and, two, non, indian, languages, old, javanese, and, arabic, the, text, fell, into, obscurity, for, nearly, 700, years, from, the, 12th, to, 19th, century, and, made, a, comeback, in, late, 19th, century, due, to, the, efforts, of, swami, vivekananda, and, others, it, gained, prominence, again, as, a, comeback, classic, in, the, 20th, century, before, the, 20th, century, history, indicates, the, indian, yoga, scene, was, dominated, by, other, yoga, texts, such, as, the, bhagavad, gita, yoga, vasistha, and, yoga, yajnavalkya, scholars, consider, the, yoga, s, tras, of, pata, jali, formulations, as, one, of, the, foundations, of, classical, yoga, philosophy, of, hinduism, the, mah, bh, ya, great, commentary, of, pata, jali, on, the, a, dhy, y, of, p, ini, is, a, major, early, exposition, on, p, ini, along, with, the, somewhat, earlier, varttika, by, katyayana, patanjali, relates, to, how, words, and, meanings, are, associated, patanjali, claims, shabdapram, nah, that, the, evidentiary, value, of, words, is, inherent, in, them, and, not, derived, externally, the, word, meaning, association, is, natural, these, issues, in, the, word, meaning, relation, symbol, would, be, elaborated, in, the, sanskrit, linguistic, tradition, in, debates, between, the, mimamsa, nyaya, and, buddhist, schools, over, the, next, fifteen, centuries, patanjali, also, defines, an, early, notion, of, sphota, which, would, be, elaborated, considerably, by, later, sanskrit, linguists, like, bhartrihari, in, patanjali, a, sphota, from, sphut, spurt, burst, is, the, invariant, quality, of, speech, the, noisy, element, dhvani, audible, part, can, be, long, or, short, but, the, sphota, remains, unaffected, by, individual, speaker, differences, thus, a, single, letter, or, sound, varna, such, as, k, p, or, a, is, an, abstraction, distinct, from, variants, produced, in, actual, enunciation, this, concept, has, been, linked, to, the, modern, notion, of, phoneme, the, minimum, distinction, that, defines, semantically, distinct, sounds, thus, a, phoneme, is, an, abstraction, for, a, range, of, sounds, however, in, later, writings, especially, in, bhartrihari, 6th, century, ce, the, notion, of, sphota, changes, to, become, more, of, a, mental, state, preceding, the, actual, utterance, akin, to, the, lemma, pata, jali, s, writings, also, elaborate, some, principles, of, morphology, prakriy, in, the, context, of, elaborating, on, p, ini, s, aphorisms, he, also, discusses, k, ty, yana, s, commentary, which, are, also, aphoristic, and, s, tra, like, in, the, later, tradition, these, were, transmitted, as, embedded, in, pata, jali, s, discussion, in, general, he, defends, many, positions, of, p, ini, which, were, interpreted, somewhat, differently, in, katyayana, unlike, p, ini, s, objectives, in, the, ashtyadhyayi, which, is, to, distinguish, correct, forms, and, meanings, from, incorrect, ones, shabdaunushasana, patanjali, s, objectives, are, more, metaphysical, these, include, the, correct, recitations, of, the, scriptures, agama, maintaining, the, purity, of, texts, raksha, clarifying, ambiguity, asamdeha, and, also, the, pedagogic, goal, of, providing, an, easier, learning, mechanism, laghu, this, stronger, metaphysical, bent, has, also, been, indicated, by, some, as, one, of, the, unifying, themes, between, the, yoga, sutras, and, the, mah, bh, ya, although, a, close, examination, of, actual, sanskrit, usage, by, woods, showed, no, similarities, in, language, or, terminology, the, text, of, the, mah, bh, ya, was, first, critically, edited, by, the, 19th, century, orientalist, franz, kielhorn, who, also, developed, philological, criteria, for, distinguishing, k, ty, yana, s, voice, from, pata, jali, s, subsequently, a, number, of, other, editions, have, come, out, the, 1968, text, and, translation, by, s, d, joshi, and, j, h, f, roodbergen, often, being, considered, definitive, regrettably, the, latter, work, is, incomplete, patanjali, is, often, stated, as, having, claimed, there, was, a, hostility, between, the, orthodox, brahminic, astika, groups, and, the, heterodox, nastika, groups, buddhism, jainism, and, atheists, like, that, between, a, mongoose, and, a, snake, nathan, mcgovern, argues, patanjali, never, used, this, mongoose, snake, analogy, patanjali, also, sheds, light, on, contemporary, events, commenting, on, the, recent, greek, incursion, and, also, on, several, tribes, that, lived, in, the, northwest, regions, of, the, subcontinent, patanjali, is, also, the, reputed, author, of, a, medical, text, called, patanjalah, also, called, patanjala, or, patanjalatantra, this, text, is, quoted, in, many, yoga, and, health, related, indian, texts, patanjali, is, called, a, medical, authority, in, a, number, of, sanskrit, texts, such, as, yogaratnakara, yogaratnasamuccaya, padarthavijnana, cakradatta, bhasya, some, of, these, quotes, are, unique, to, patanjala, but, others, are, also, found, in, major, hindu, medical, treatises, such, as, charaka, samhita, and, sushruta, samhita, there, is, a, fourth, scholar, also, named, patanjali, who, likely, lived, in, 8th, century, and, wrote, a, commentary, on, charaka, samhita, and, this, text, is, called, carakavarttika, the, two, medical, scholars, named, patanjali, may, be, the, same, person, but, generally, accepted, to, be, completely, different, person, than, the, patanjali, who, wrote, the, sanskrit, grammar, classic, mahabhasya, patanjali, is, honoured, with, invocations, and, shrines, in, some, modern, schools, of, yoga, including, iyengar, yoga, and, ashtanga, vinyasa, yoga, the, yoga, scholar, david, gordon, white, writes, that, yoga, teacher, training, often, includes, mandatory, instruction, in, the, yoga, sutra, white, calls, this, curious, to, say, the, least, since, the, text, is, in, his, view, essentially, irrelevant, to, yoga, as, it, is, taught, and, practiced, today, commenting, that, the, yoga, sutra, is, nearly, devoid, of, discussion, of, postures, stretching, and, breathing
