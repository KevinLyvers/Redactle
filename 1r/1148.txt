war, with, muscovy, ended, in, december, 1408, on, terms, that, made, further, conflict, with, the, teutonic, order, inevitable, despite, hermann, ii, of, celje, s, attempt, to, negotiate, a, solution, we, do, not, know, on, whose, merits, or, guilt, such, a, decision, was, made, or, with, what, we, have, offended, your, lordship, so, much, that, your, lordship, has, deservedly, been, directed, against, us, creating, hardship, for, us, everywhere, first, of, all, you, made, and, announced, a, decision, about, the, land, of, samogitia, which, is, our, inheritance, and, our, homeland, from, the, legal, succession, of, the, ancestors, and, elders, we, still, own, it, it, is, and, has, always, been, the, same, lithuanian, land, because, there, is, one, language, and, the, same, inhabitants, but, since, the, land, of, samogitia, is, located, lower, than, the, land, of, lithuania, it, is, called, as, samogitia, because, in, lithuanian, it, is, called, lower, land, and, the, samogitians, call, lithuania, as, auk, taitija, that, is, from, the, samogitian, point, of, view, a, higher, land, also, the, people, of, samogitia, have, long, called, themselves, as, lithuanians, and, never, as, samogitians, and, because, of, such, identity, sic, we, do, not, write, about, samogitia, in, our, letter, because, everything, is, one, one, country, and, the, same, inhabitants, vytautas, the, great, excerpt, from, his, 11, march, 1420, latin, letter, sent, to, sigismund, holy, roman, emperor, in, which, he, described, the, core, of, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, composed, from, emaitija, lowlands, and, auk, taitija, highlands, term, auk, taitija, is, known, since, the, 13th, century, in, the, treaty, of, salynas, vytautas, had, transferred, samogitia, to, the, teutonic, knights, samogitia, was, especially, important, for, the, order, because, it, separated, the, teutonic, knights, based, in, prussia, from, the, livonian, order, based, in, latvia, the, two, orders, desired, to, unite, and, form, a, mighty, force, however, the, knights, ruled, samogitia, for, only, three, years, because, on, 13, march, 1401, the, samogitians, supported, by, vytautas, rebelled, and, burned, two, castles, the, knights, received, support, from, vitrigaila, brother, of, jogaila, who, desired, to, take, vytautas, title, in, 1404, peace, of, raci, was, signed, which, in, essence, repeated, the, treaty, of, salynas, samogitia, was, transferred, to, the, teutonic, knights, poland, promised, not, to, support, lithuania, in, case, of, another, war, the, knights, promised, to, support, vytautas, in, the, east, and, not, to, support, any, gediminid, who, could, have, claims, to, the, title, of, grand, duke, of, lithuania, however, the, treaty, did, not, solve, the, problems, and, all, the, parties, prepared, for, war, in, 1408, vytautas, reached, peace, in, the, east, and, returned, to, samogitian, matters, in, 1409, the, second, samogitian, uprising, against, the, teutonic, knights, began, as, the, rebels, burned, skirsnemun, castle, both, poland, and, lithuania, supported, the, rebels, vytautas, gathered, a, large, army, from, 18, lands, under, his, control, the, army, joined, polish, forces, and, advanced, towards, the, teutonic, headquarters, at, the, castle, of, marienburg, present, day, malbork, in, 1410, vytautas, himself, commanded, the, forces, of, the, grand, duchy, in, the, battle, of, grunwald, the, battle, ended, in, a, decisive, polish, lithuanian, victory, even, though, the, siege, of, marienburg, was, unsuccessful, the, teutonic, knights, never, regained, their, strength, and, from, then, on, posed, a, reduced, threat, to, poland, lithuania, from, now, on, poland, lithuania, began, to, be, regarded, in, the, west, as, a, great, power, and, vytautas, stood, in, high, favour, with, the, roman, curia, as, a, result, of, the, peace, of, thorn, of, 1411, vytautas, received, samogitia, for, his, lifetime, however, the, parties, could, not, agree, on, the, border, sigismund, holy, roman, emperor, agreed, to, mediate, the, dispute, in, 1413, it, was, declared, that, the, whole, right, bank, of, the, nemunas, neman, river, was, samogitia, and, therefore, belonged, to, lithuania, the, teutonic, knights, disagreed, and, a, new, war, started, in, 1414, the, war, lasted, for, just, a, few, months, and, the, dispute, was, brought, to, the, council, of, constance, even, though, the, dispute, was, not, resolved, the, samogitians, had, a, chance, to, present, their, case, to, the, leaders, of, europe, it, is, seen, as, an, important, event, in, the, diplomatic, history, of, lithuania, several, other, mediation, attempts, failed, and, yet, another, war, with, the, teutonic, order, started, in, 1422, after, several, months, of, fighting, the, treaty, of, lake, melno, was, signed, samogitia, was, returned, to, lithuania, in, perpetuity, while, the, city, of, memel, present, day, klaip, da, and, surrounding, territories, stayed, with, the, order, this, border, as, established, by, the, treaty, remained, stable, for, some, 500, years, until, the, memel, territory, dispute, of, 1923, with, peace, established, vytautas, could, now, concentrate, on, reforms, and, the, relationship, with, poland, in, 1399, jadwiga, of, poland, and, her, newborn, died, in, childbirth, jogaila, s, power, in, poland, was, jeopardised, as, he, was, a, foreigner, king, with, no, other, ties, to, the, throne, but, his, wife, also, the, defeat, at, vorskla, forced, a, re, evaluation, of, the, relationship, between, poland, and, lithuania, the, result, was, the, union, of, vilnius, and, radom, in, 1401, vytautas, was, granted, wide, autonomy, but, after, his, death, the, title, and, powers, of, grand, duke, of, lithuania, were, to, be, transferred, to, the, king, of, poland, in, case, jagie, o, died, first, without, an, heir, the, polish, nobility, agreed, not, to, elect, a, new, king, without, consulting, vytautas, the, unique, feature, of, this, union, was, that, the, lithuanian, nobility, presented, their, own, document, for, the, first, time, somebody, other, than, dukes, played, a, role, in, the, state, matters, vytautas, was, one, of, the, creators, of, the, union, of, horod, o, with, poland, in, 1413, according, to, the, act, of, the, union, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, was, to, retain, a, separate, grand, duke, and, its, own, parliament, at, the, same, time, both, the, polish, and, lithuanian, sejms, were, to, discuss, all, the, important, matters, jointly, this, union, was, important, culturally, as, well, as, politically, because, it, granted, lithuanian, christian, nobles, the, same, rights, as, the, polish, szlachta, this, act, did, not, include, orthodox, nobles, this, paved, the, way, for, more, contacts, and, cooperation, between, the, nobles, of, poland, and, of, lithuania, in, january, 1429, at, the, congress, of, lutsk, it, was, proposed, by, sigismund, king, of, hungary, that, vytautas, should, be, crowned, king, of, lithuania, it, resulted, in, a, great, crisis, between, vytautas, king, w, adys, aw, and, polish, nobles, the, envoys, who, were, transporting, documents, supporting, vytautas, s, coronation, and, proposing, an, alliance, between, lithuania, hungary, and, the, teutonic,

his, day, in, eastern, europe, and, his, martial, valour, was, combined, with, statesmanlike, foresight, vytautas, backed, the, economic, development, of, his, state, and, introduced, many, reforms, under, his, rule, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, gradually, became, more, centralised, as, local, princes, with, dynastic, ties, to, the, throne, were, replaced, by, the, governors, loyal, to,
