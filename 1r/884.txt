advaita, schools, of, hindu, philosophies, madhva, and, his, followers, introduced, kevala, pramaana, as, the, knowledge, of, an, object, as, it, is, separate, from, anu, pramana, described, above, madhva, s, dvaita, school, holds, that, vishnu, as, a, god, who, is, also, hari, krishna, vasudeva, and, narayana, can, only, be, known, through, the, proper, samanvaya, connection, and, pramana, of, the, vedic, scriptural, teachings, vishnu, according, to, madhvacharya, is, not, the, creator, of, the, vedas, but, the, teacher, of, the, vedas, madhva, s, school, of, thought, assert, that, knowledge, is, intrinsically, valid, and, the, knower, and, the, known, are, independently, real, madhvacharya, asserted, that, both, the, ritual, part, karma, kanda, mimamsa, and, the, knowledge, part, jnana, kanda, upanishadic, vedanta, in, the, vedas, are, equally, valid, and, an, interconnected, whole, as, asserted, by, the, mimamsa, school, of, hindu, philosophy, madhvacharya, held, that, the, vedas, are, author, less, and, that, their, truth, is, in, all, of, its, parts, i, e, the, sa, hitas, br, hma, as, ra, yak, s, and, upani, ads, the, metaphysical, reality, is, plural, stated, madhvacharya, there, are, primarily, two, tattvas, or, categories, of, reality, svatantra, tattva, independent, reality, and, asvatantra, tattva, dependent, reality, ishvara, as, god, vishnu, or, krishna, is, the, cause, of, the, universe, and, the, only, independent, reality, in, madhvacharya, s, view, the, created, universe, is, the, dependent, reality, consisting, of, j, va, individual, souls, and, jada, matter, material, things, individual, souls, are, plural, different, and, distinct, realities, j, va, s, are, sentient, and, matter, is, non, sentient, according, to, madhvacharya, madhva, further, enumerates, the, difference, between, dependent, and, independent, reality, as, a, fivefold, division, pancha, bheda, between, god, souls, and, material, things, these, differences, are, 1, between, material, things, 2, between, material, thing, and, soul, 3, between, material, thing, and, god, 4, between, souls, and, 5, between, soul, and, god, this, difference, is, neither, temporary, nor, merely, practical, it, is, an, invariable, and, natural, property, of, everything, madhva, calls, it, taratamya, gradation, in, pluralism, there, is, no, object, like, another, according, to, madhvacharya, there, is, no, soul, like, another, all, souls, are, unique, reflected, in, individual, personalities, the, sea, is, full, the, tank, is, full, a, pot, is, full, everything, is, full, yet, each, fullness, is, different, asserted, madhvacharya, taratamya, is, based, on, inherent, differences, amongst, all, beings, these, differences, determine, whether, souls, are, eligible, for, liberation, rebirth, or, darkness, according, to, madhvacharya, even, in, liberation, moksha, the, bliss, is, different, for, each, person, based, on, each, one, s, degree, of, knowledge, and, spiritual, perfection, this, liberation, according, to, him, is, only, achievable, with, grace, of, god, vishnu, madhva, conceptualised, brahman, as, a, being, who, enjoys, his, own, bliss, while, the, entire, universe, evolves, through, a, nebulous, chaos, he, manifests, every, now, and, then, to, help, the, evolution, process, the, four, primary, manifestation, of, him, as, the, brahman, are, according, to, madhva, vasudeva, pradyumna, aniruddha, and, sankarasana, which, are, respectively, responsible, for, the, redemptive, creative, sustaining, and, destructive, aspects, in, the, universe, his, secondary, manifestations, are, many, and, all, manifestations, are, at, par, with, each, other, it, is, the, same, infinite, no, matter, how, he, manifests, brahman, is, the, creator, of, the, universe, perfect, in, knowledge, perfect, in, knowing, perfect, in, its, power, and, distinct, from, souls, distinct, from, matter, for, liberation, mere, intellectual, conceptualization, of, brahman, as, creator, is, not, enough, the, individual, soul, must, feel, attraction, love, attachment, and, devotional, surrender, to, him, and, only, his, grace, leads, to, redemption, and, liberation, according, to, madhva, the, vishnu, as, brahman, concept, of, madhvacharya, is, a, concept, similar, to, god, in, major, world, religions, his, writings, led, some, early, colonial, era, indologists, such, as, george, abraham, grierson, to, suggest, the, 13th, century, madhva, was, influenced, by, christianity, but, later, scholarship, has, rejected, this, theory, madhvacharya, considered, jnana, yoga, and, karma, yoga, to, be, insufficient, to, the, path, of, liberation, without, bhakti, vishnu, was, the, supreme, god, to, madhva, who, can, only, be, reached, through, vayu, he, further, states, faith, leads, to, the, grace, of, god, and, grace, leads, to, the, liberation, of, soul, the, knowledge, of, god, for, madhvacharya, is, not, a, matter, of, intellectual, acceptance, of, the, concept, but, an, attraction, affection, constant, attachment, loving, devotion, and, complete, surrender, to, the, grace, of, god, he, rejects, monist, theories, believing, that, knowledge, liberates, asserting, instead, that, it, is, divine, grace, through, bhakti, that, liberates, to, madhva, god, obscures, reality, by, creating, maya, and, prakriti, which, causes, bondage, and, suffering, and, only, god, can, be, the, source, of, soul, s, release, liberation, occurs, when, with, the, grace, of, god, one, knows, the, true, nature, of, self, and, the, true, nature, of, god, evil, and, suffering, in, the, world, according, to, madhvacharya, originates, in, man, and, not, god, every, jiva, individual, soul, is, the, agent, of, actions, not, jada, matter, and, not, ishvara, god, while, madhva, asserts, each, individual, self, is, the, kartritva, real, agency, the, self, is, not, an, absolutely, independent, agent, to, him, this, is, because, states, madhva, the, soul, is, influenced, by, sensory, organs, one, s, physical, body, and, such, material, things, which, he, calls, as, gifts, of, god, man, has, free, will, but, is, influenced, by, his, innate, nature, inclinations, and, past, karma, madhvacharya, asserts, yathecchasi, tatha, kuru, which, sharma, translates, and, explains, as, one, has, the, right, to, choose, between, right, and, wrong, a, choice, each, individual, makes, out, of, his, own, responsibility, and, his, own, risk, madhva, does, not, address, the, problem, of, evil, that, is, how, can, evil, exist, with, that, of, a, god, who, is, omnipotent, omniscient, and, omnibenevolent, according, to, sharma, madhva, s, tripartite, classification, of, souls, makes, it, unnecessary, to, answer, the, problem, of, evil, according, to, david, buchta, this, does, not, address, the, problem, of, evil, because, the, omnipotent, god, could, change, the, system, but, chooses, not, to, and, thus, sustains, the, evil, in, the, world, this, view, of, self, s, agency, of, madhvacharya, was, states, buchta, an, outlier, in, vedanta, school, and, indian, philosophies, in, general, this, accusation, of, david, buchta, is, answered, by, the, arrangement, that, the, tripartite, characteristic, is, intrinsic, of, the, souls, that, is, to, say, those, characteristics, define, the, soul, and, any, attempt, to, change, that, would, mean, replacing, souls, themselves, seeing, no, point, in, repairing, the, prevalent, characteristics, if, the, very, identity, of, the, souls, is, in, danger, the, omnipotent, does, not, change, them, thus, answering, the, problem, of, evil, moral, laws, and, ethics, exist, according, to, madhva, and, are, necessary, for, the, grace, of, god, and, for, liberation, madhvacharya, was, a, fierce, critic, of, competing, vedanta, schools, and, other, schools, of, indian, philosophies, such, as, buddhism, and, jainism, he, wrote, up, arguments, against, twenty, one, ancient, and, medieval, era, indian, scholars, to, help, establish, the, foundations, of, his, own, school, of, thought, madhvacharya, was, most, ardent, critic, of, advaita, vedanta, accusing, shankara, and, the, advaitins, of, teaching, buddhism, under, the, cover, of, vedanta, advaita, s, nondualism, asserts, that, atman, soul, and, brahman, are, blissful, and, identical, unchanging, transcendent, reality, there, is, interconnected, oneness, of, all, souls, and, brahman, with, no, pluralities, madhva, in, contrast, asserts, that, atman, soul, and, brahman, are, different, only, vishnu, is, the, lord, brahman, individual, souls, are, also, distinct, and, depend, on, vishnu, and, there, are, pluralities, of, all, schools, madhva, directed, his, critique, at, advaita, most, penning, four, major, texts, including, upadhikhandana, and, tattvadyota, primarily, dedicated, to, scrutinizing, advaita, madhvacharya, disagreed, with, aspects, of, ramanuja, s, vishishtadvaita, vishishtadvaita, school, a, realist, system, of, thought, like, madhvacharya, s, dvaita, school, also, asserts, that, jiva, human, souls, and, brahman, as, vishnu, are, different, a, difference, that, is, never, transcended, god, vishnu, alone, is, independent, all, other, gods, and, beings, are, dependent, on, him, according, to, both, madhvacharya, and, ramanuja, however, in, contrast, to, madhvacharya, s, views, vishishtadvaita, school, asserts, qualified, non, dualism, that, souls, share, the, same, essential, nature, of, brahman, and, that, there, is, a, universal, sameness, in, the, quality, and, degree, of, bliss, possible, for, human, souls, and, every, soul, can, reach, the, bliss, state, of, god, himself, while, the, older, school, of, vishishtadvaita, asserted, qualitative, monism, and, quantitative, pluralism, of, souls, states, sharma, madhvacharya, asserted, both, qualitative, and, quantitative, pluralism, of, souls, shankara, s, advaita, school, and, ramanuja, s, vishishtadvaita, school, are, premised, on, the, assumption, that, all, souls, can, hope, for, and, achieve, the, state, of, blissful, liberation, in, contrast, madhvacharya, posited, that, some, souls, enjoy, spreading, chaos, and, irreligion, and, even, enjoy, being, eternally, doomed, and, damned, as, such, madhvacharya, s, style, of, criticism, of, other, schools, of, indian, philosophy, was, part, of, the, ancient, and, medieval, indian, tradition, he, was, part, of, the, vedanta, school, which, emerged, in, post, vedic, period, as, the, most, influential, of, the, six, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, and, his, targeting, of, advaita, tradition, states, bryant, reflects, it, being, the, most, influential, of, vedanta, schools, madhvacharya, extended, an, independent, original,

songs, suladees, and, bhakti, dasa, sahitya, these, haridasas, came, to, be, known, as, the, dasa, section, or, dasa, kuta, of, the, madhva, sampradaya, in, contrast, with, the, vyaasa, kuta, who, were, scholars, pandits, or, teachers, of, literature, critical, thought, there, is, no, difference, between, the, vyasa, kuta, and, dasa, kuta, in, their, learning, training, or, approach, to,

the, meassage, of, dvaita, philosophy, through, simplified, vernacular, bhakti, movement, other, influential, subschools, of, vaishnavism, competed, with, the, ideas, of, madhvacharya, such, as, the, chaitanya, subschool, whose, jiva, gosvami, asserts, that, only, krishna, is, svayam, bhagavan, the, supreme, form, of, god, in, contrast, to, madhva, who, asserts, that, all, vishnu, avatars, are,
