parents, were, jens, amundsen, and, hanna, sahlqvist, roald, was, the, fourth, son, in, the, family, his, mother, wanted, him, to, avoid, the, family, maritime, trade, and, encouraged, him, to, become, a, doctor, a, promise, that, amundsen, kept, until, his, mother, died, when, he, was, aged, 21, he, promptly, quit, university, for, a, life, at, sea, amundsen, was, in, the, uranienborg, neighbourhood, an, occasional, childhood, playmate, of, the, pioneering, antarctica, explorer, carsten, borchgrevink, when, he, was, fifteen, years, old, amundsen, was, enthralled, by, reading, sir, john, franklin, s, narratives, of, his, overland, arctic, expeditions, amundsen, wrote, i, read, them, with, a, fervid, fascination, which, has, shaped, the, whole, course, of, my, life, amundsen, joined, the, belgian, antarctic, expedition, as, first, mate, at, the, age, of, 25, in, 1897, this, expedition, led, by, adrien, de, gerlache, using, the, ship, the, rv, belgica, became, the, first, expedition, to, overwinter, in, antarctica, the, belgica, whether, by, mistake, or, design, became, locked, in, the, sea, ice, at, 70, 30, s, off, alexander, island, west, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, the, crew, endured, a, winter, for, which, they, were, poorly, prepared, by, amundsen, s, own, estimation, the, doctor, for, the, expedition, the, american, frederick, cook, probably, saved, the, crew, from, scurvy, by, hunting, for, animals, and, feeding, the, crew, fresh, meat, in, cases, where, citrus, fruits, are, lacking, raw, meat, particularly, offal, from, animals, often, contains, enough, vitamin, c, to, prevent, scurvy, in, 1903, amundsen, led, the, first, expedition, to, traverse, canada, s, northwest, passage, between, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, he, planned, a, small, expedition, of, six, men, in, a, 45, ton, fishing, vessel, gj, a, to, have, flexibility, his, ship, had, relatively, shallow, draft, his, technique, was, to, use, a, small, ship, and, hug, the, coast, amundsen, had, the, ship, outfitted, with, a, small, 13, horsepower, single, screw, paraffin, diesel, engine, they, traveled, via, baffin, bay, the, parry, channel, and, then, south, through, peel, sound, james, ross, strait, simpson, strait, and, rae, strait, they, spent, two, winters, at, king, william, island, in, the, harbor, of, what, is, today, gjoa, haven, during, this, time, amundsen, and, the, crew, learned, from, the, local, netsilik, inuit, about, arctic, survival, skills, which, he, found, invaluable, in, his, later, expedition, to, the, south, pole, for, example, he, learned, to, use, sled, dogs, for, the, transport, of, goods, and, to, wear, animal, skins, in, lieu, of, heavy, woolen, parkas, which, could, not, keep, out, the, cold, when, wet, leaving, gjoa, haven, he, sailed, west, and, passed, cambridge, bay, which, had, been, reached, from, the, west, by, richard, collinson, in, 1852, continuing, to, the, south, of, victoria, island, the, ship, cleared, the, canadian, arctic, archipelago, on, 17, august, 1905, it, had, to, stop, for, the, winter, before, going, on, to, nome, on, alaska, s, pacific, coast, the, nearest, telegraph, station, was, 500, mi, 800, km, away, in, eagle, amundsen, traveled, there, overland, to, wire, a, success, message, on, 5, december, then, returned, to, nome, in, 1906, later, that, year, he, was, elected, to, the, american, antiquarian, society, amundsen, learned, of, the, dissolution, of, the, union, between, norway, and, sweden, and, that, he, had, a, new, king, the, explorer, sent, the, new, king, haakon, vii, news, that, his, traversing, the, northwest, passage, was, a, great, achievement, for, norway, he, said, he, hoped, to, do, more, and, signed, it, your, loyal, subject, roald, amundsen, the, crew, returned, to, oslo, in, november, 1906, after, almost, three, and, a, half, years, abroad, gj, a, was, returned, to, norway, in, 1972, after, a, 45, day, trip, from, san, francisco, on, a, bulk, carrier, she, was, placed, on, land, outside, the, fram, museum, in, oslo, where, she, is, now, situated, inside, her, own, building, at, the, museum, amundsen, next, planned, to, take, an, expedition, to, the, north, pole, and, explore, the, arctic, basin, finding, it, difficult, to, raise, funds, when, he, heard, in, 1909, that, the, americans, frederick, cook, and, robert, peary, had, claimed, to, reach, the, north, pole, as, a, result, of, two, different, expeditions, he, decided, to, reroute, to, antarctica, he, was, not, clear, about, his, intentions, and, robert, f, scott, and, the, norwegian, supporters, felt, misled, scott, was, planning, his, own, expedition, to, the, south, pole, that, year, using, the, ship, fram, earlier, used, by, fridtjof, nansen, amundsen, left, oslo, for, the, south, on, 3, june, 1910, at, madeira, amundsen, alerted, his, men, that, they, would, be, heading, to, antarctica, and, sent, a, telegram, to, scott, beg, to, inform, you, fram, proceeding, antarctic, amundsen, nearly, six, months, later, the, expedition, arrived, at, the, eastern, edge, of, the, ross, ice, shelf, then, known, as, the, great, ice, barrier, at, a, large, inlet, called, the, bay, of, whales, on, 14, january, 1911, amundsen, established, his, base, camp, there, calling, it, framheim, amundsen, eschewed, the, heavy, wool, clothing, worn, on, earlier, antarctic, attempts, in, favour, of, adopting, inuit, style, furred, skins, using, skis, and, dog, sleds, for, transportation, amundsen, and, his, men, created, supply, depots, at, 80, 81, and, 82, south, on, the, barrier, along, a, line, directly, south, to, the, pole, amundsen, also, planned, to, kill, most, of, his, dogs, on, the, way, and, use, them, as, a, source, for, fresh, meat, as, he, went, he, butchered, some, of, the, dogs, and, fed, them, to, the, remaining, dogs, as, well, as, eating, some, himself, a, small, group, including, hjalmar, johansen, kristian, prestrud, and, j, rgen, stubberud, set, out, on, 8, september, but, had, to, abandon, their, trek, due, to, extreme, temperatures, the, painful, retreat, caused, a, quarrel, within, the, group, and, amundsen, sent, johansen, and, the, other, two, men, to, explore, king, edward, vii, land, a, second, attempt, with, a, team, of, five, made, up, of, olav, bjaaland, helmer, hanssen, sverre, hassel, oscar, wisting, and, amundsen, departed, base, camp, on, 19, october, they, took, four, sledges, and, 52, dogs, using, a, route, along, the, previously, unknown, axel, heiberg, glacier, they, arrived, at, the, edge, of, the, polar, plateau, on, 21, november, after, a, four, day, climb, the, team, and, 16, dogs, arrived, at, the, pole, on, 14, december, a, month, before, scott, s, group, amundsen, named, their, south, pole, camp, polheim, amundsen, renamed, the, antarctic, plateau, as, king, haakon, vii, s, plateau, they, left, a, small, tent, and, letter, stating, their, accomplishment, in, case, they, did, not, return, safely, to, framheim, the, team, arrived, at, framheim, on, 25, january, 1912, with, 11, surviving, dogs, they, made, their, way, off, the, continent, and, to, hobart, australia, where, amundsen, publicly, announced, his, success, on, 7, march, 1912, he, telegraphed, news, to, backers, amundsen, s, expedition, benefited, from, his, careful, preparation, good, equipment, appropriate, clothing, a, simple, primary, task, an, understanding, of, dogs, and, their, handling, and, the, effective, use, of, skis, in, contrast, to, the, misfortunes, of, scott, s, team, amundsen, s, trek, proved, relatively, smooth, and, uneventful, in, 1918, an, expedition, amundsen, began, with, a, new, ship, maud, lasted, until, 1925, maud, was, carefully, navigated, through, the, ice, west, to, east, through, the, northeast, passage, with, him, on, this, expedition, were, oscar, wisting, and, helmer, hanssen, both, of, whom, had, been, part, of, the, team, to, reach, the, south, pole, in, addition, henrik, lindstr, m, was, included, as, a, cook, he, suffered, a, stroke, and, was, so, physically, reduced, that, he, could, not, participate, the, goal, of, the, expedition, was, to, explore, the, unknown, areas, of, the, arctic, ocean, strongly, inspired, by, fridtjof, nansen, s, earlier, expedition, with, fram, the, plan, was, to, sail, along, the, coast, of, siberia, and, go, into, the, ice, farther, to, the, north, and, east, than, nansen, had, in, contrast, to, amundsen, s, earlier, expeditions, this, was, expected, to, yield, more, material, for, academic, research, and, he, carried, the, geophysicist, harald, sverdrup, on, board, the, voyage, was, to, the, northeasterly, direction, over, the, kara, sea, amundsen, planned, to, freeze, the, maud, into, the, polar, ice, cap, and, drift, towards, the, north, pole, as, nansen, had, done, with, the, fram, and, he, did, so, off, cape, chelyuskin, but, the, ice, became, so, thick, that, the, ship, was, unable, to, break, free, although, it, was, designed, for, such, a, journey, in, heavy, ice, in, september, 1919, the, crew, got, the, ship, loose, from, the, ice, but, it, froze, again, after, eleven, days, somewhere, between, the, new, siberian, islands, and, wrangel, island, during, this, time, amundsen, suffered, a, broken, arm, and, was, attacked, by, a, polar, bear, as, a, result, he, participated, little, in, the, work, outdoors, such, as, sleigh, rides, and, hunting, he, hanssen, and, wisting, along, with, two, other, men, embarked, on, an, expedition, by, dog, sled, to, nome, alaska, more, than, 1, 000, kilometres, 620, mi, away, but, they, found, that, the, ice, was, not, frozen, solid, in, the, bering, strait, and, it, could, not, be, crossed, they, sent, a, telegram, from, anadyr, to, signal, their, location, after, two, winters, frozen, in, the, ice, without, having, achieved, the, goal, of, drifting, over, the, north, pole, amundsen, decided, to, go, to, nome, to, repair, the, ship, and, buy, provisions, several, of, the, crew, ashore, there, including, hanssen, did, not, return, on, time, to, the, ship, amundsen, considered, hanssen, to, be, in, breach, of, contract, and, dismissed, him, from, the, crew, during, the, third, winter, maud, was, frozen, in, the, western, bering, strait, she, finally, became, free, and, the, expedition, sailed, south, reaching, seattle, in, the, american, pacific, northwest, in, 1921, for, repairs, amundsen, returned, to, norway, needing, to, put, his, finances, in, order, he, took, with, him, two, young, indigenous, girls, a, four, year, old, he, adopted, kakonita, and, her, companion, camilla, when, amundsen, went, bankrupt, two, years, later, however, he, sent, the, girls, to, be, cared, for, by, camilla, s, father, who, lived, in, eastern, russia, in, june, 1922, amundsen, returned, to, maud, which, had, been, sailed, to, nome, he, decided, to, shift, from, the, planned, naval, expedition, to, aerial, ones, and, arranged, to, charter, a, plane, he, divided, the, expedition, team, in, two, one, part, led, by, him, was, to, winter, over, and, prepare, for, an, attempt, to, fly, over, the, pole, in, 1923, the, second, team, on, maud, under, the, command, of, wisting, was, to, resume, the, original, plan, to, drift, over, the, north, pole, in, the, ice, the, ship, drifted, in, the, ice, for, three, years, east, of, the, new, siberian, islands, never, reaching, the, north, pole, it, was, finally, seized, by, amundsen, s, creditors, as, collateral, for, his, mounting, debt, although, they, were, unable, to, reach, the, north, pole, the, scientific, results, of, the, expedition, mainly, the, work, of, sverdrup, have, proven, to, be, of, considerable, value, much, of, the, carefully, collected, scientific, data, was, lost, during, the, ill, fated, journey, of, peter, tessem, and, paul, knutsen, two, crew, members, sent, on, a, mission, by, amundsen, the, scientific, materials, were, later, retrieved, in, 1922, by, russian, scientist, nikolay, urvantsev, from, where, they, had, been, abandoned, on, the, shores, of, the, kara, sea, the, 1923, attempt, to, fly, over, the, pole, failed, amundsen, and, oskar, omdal, of, the, royal, norwegian, navy, tried, to, fly, from, wainwright, alaska, to, spitsbergen, across, the, north, pole, when, their, aircraft, was, damaged, they, abandoned, the, journey, to, raise, additional, funds, amundsen, traveled, around, the, united, states, in, 1924, on, a, lecture, tour, in, 1925, accompanied, by, lincoln, ellsworth, pilot, hjalmar, riiser, larsen, flight, mechanic, karl, feucht, and, two, other, team, members, amundsen, took, two, dornier, do, j, flying, boats, the, n, 24, and, n, 25, to, 87, 44, north, it, was, the, northernmost, latitude, reached, by, plane, up, to, that, time, the, aircraft, landed, a, few, miles, apart, without, radio, contact, yet, the, crews, managed, to, reunite, the, n, 24, was, damaged, amundsen, and, his, crew, worked, for, more, than, three, weeks, to, clean, up, an, airstrip, to, take, off, from, ice, they, shovelled, 600, tons, of, ice, while, consuming, only, one, pound, 450, g, of, daily, food, rations, in, the, end, the, six, crew, members, were, packed, into, the, n, 25, in, a, remarkable, feat, riiser, larsen, took, off, and, they, barely, became, airborne, over, the, cracking, ice, they, returned, triumphant, when, everyone, thought, they, had, been, lost, forever, in, 1926, amundsen, and, 15, other, men, including, ellsworth, riiser, larsen, oscar, wisting, and, the, italian, air, crew, led, by, aeronautical, engineer, umberto, nobile, made, the, first, crossing, of, the, arctic, in, the, airship, norge, designed, by, nobile, they, left, spitsbergen, on, 11, may, 1926, flew, over, the, north, pole, on, 12, may, and, landed, in, alaska, the, following, day, the, three, previous, claims, to, have, arrived, at, the, north, pole, by, the, americans, frederick, cook, in, 1908, robert, peary, in, 1909, and, richard, e, byrd, in, 1926, just, a, few, days, before, the, norge, are, disputed, by, some, as, being, either, of, dubious, accuracy, or, outrightly, fraudulent, if, these, other, claims, are, false, the, crew, of, the, norge, would, be, the, first, explorers, verified, to, have, reached, the, north, pole, when, they, floated, over, it, in, the, norge, in, 1926, if, the, norge, expedition, was, the, first, to, the, north, pole, amundsen, and, oscar, wisting, were, the, first, men, to, have, reached, both, geographical, poles, by, ground, or, by, air, amundsen, disappeared, on, 18, june, 1928, while, flying, on, a, rescue, mission, in, the, arctic, his, team, included, norwegian, pilot, leif, dietrichson, french, pilot, ren, guilbaud, and, three, more, frenchmen, they, were, seeking, missing, members, of, nobile, s, crew, whose, new, airship, italia, had, crashed, while, returning, from, the, north, pole, amundsen, s, french, latham, 47, flying, boat, never, returned, later, a, wing, float, and, bottom, gasoline, tank, from, the, plane, which, had, been, adapted, as, a, replacement, wing, float, were, found, near, the, troms, coast, it, is, assumed, that, the, plane, crashed, in, the, barents, sea, and, that, amundsen, and, his, crew, were, killed, in, the, wreck, or, died, shortly, afterward, the, search, for, amundsen, and, team, was, called, off, in, september, 1928, by, the, norwegian, government, and, the, bodies, were, never, found, in, 2004, and, in, late, august, 2009, the, royal, norwegian, navy, used, the, unmanned, submarine, hugin, 1000, to, search, for, the, wreckage, of, amundsen, s, plane, the, searches, focused, on, a, 40, square, mile, 100, km, 2, area, of, the, sea, floor, and, were, documented, by, the, german, production, company, contexttv, they, found, nothing, from, the, amundsen, flight, amundsen, was, a, lifelong, bachelor, but, he, had, a, long, time, relationship, with, the, norwegian, born, kristine, elisabeth, kiss, bennett, the, wife, of, an, englishman, charles, peto, bennett, he, met, her, in, london, in, 1907, and, they, remained, close, for, many, years, amundsen, kept, the, relationship, a, secret, from, everyone, outside, his, intimate, circle, later, he, became, engaged, to, bess, magids, an, american, divorc, e, whom, he, had, met, in, alaska, though, there, is, little, evidence, it, was, said, that, amundsen, had, a, brief, affair, with, his, landlady, in, antwerp, until, he, came, home, and, found, her, dead, after, an, apparent, suicide, his, biographer, tor, bomann, larsen, also, suggests, a, romantic, relationship, between, amundsen, and, sigrid, castberg, wife, of, the, lawyer, leif, castberg, from, gj, vik, in, the, years, before, the, south, pole, expedition, a, relationship, amundsen, broke, off, after, that, expedition, in, favour, of, kiss, bennett, author, julian, sancton, noted, that, in, his, younger, years, amundsen, was, said, to, have, ignored, romantic, relationships, in, pursuit, of, his, goals, he, found, little, use, in, activities, that, didn, t, help, him, fulfill, his, polar, ambitions, owing, to, amundsen, s, numerous, significant, accomplishments, in, polar, exploration, many, places, in, both, the, arctic, and, antarctic, are, named, after, him, the, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, operated, by, the, united, states, antarctic, program, was, jointly, named, in, honour, of, amundsen, and, his, british, rival, robert, falcon, scott, the, amundsen, crater, on, the, moon, was, named, after, him, the, rim, of, the, crater, is, being, considered, by, nasa, as, a, potential, landing, location, for, their, artemis, 3, lunar, lander, the, 1969, film, the, red, tent, tells, the, story, of, the, nobile, expedition, and, amundsen, s, disappearance, sean, connery, plays, amundsen, a, book, scott, and, amundsen, by, roland, huntford, was, adapted, into, the, tv, serial, the, last, place, on, earth, it, aired, in, 1985, and, features, sverre, anker, ousdal, as, amundsen, on, 15, february, 2019, a, biographic, norwegian, film, titled, amundsen, directed, by, espen, sandberg, was, released, at, least, two, inuit, in, gj, a, haven, with, european, ancestry, have, claimed, to, be, descendants, of, amundsen, from, the, period, of, their, extended, winter, stay, on, king, william, island, from, 1903, to, 1905, accounts, by, members, of, the, expedition, told, of, their, relations, with, inuit, women, and, historians, have, speculated, that, amundsen, might, also, have, taken, a, partner, although, he, wrote, a, warning, against, this, specifically, half, brothers, bob, konona, and, paul, ikuallaq, say, that, their, father, luke, ikuallaq, told, them, on, his, deathbed, that, he, was, the, son, of, amundsen, konona, said, that, their, father, ikuallaq, was, left, out, on, the, ice, to, die, after, his, birth, as, his, european, ancestry, made, him, illegitimate, to, the, inuit, threatening, their, community, his, inuit, grandparents, saved, him, in, 2012, y, dna, analysis, with, the, families, permission, showed, that, ikuallaq, was, not, a, match, to, the, direct, male, line, of, amundsen, not, all, descendants, claiming, european, ancestry, have, been, tested, for, a, match, to, amundsen, nor, has, there, been, a, comparison, of, ikuallaq, s, dna, to, that, of, other, european, members, of, amundsen, s, crew
