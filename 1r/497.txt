of, works, including, the, early, la, damoiselle, lue, and, the, late, le, martyre, de, saint, s, bastien, have, important, parts, for, chorus, in, his, final, years, he, focused, on, chamber, music, completing, three, of, six, planned, sonatas, for, different, combinations, of, instruments, with, early, influences, including, russian, and, far, eastern, music, and, works, by, chopin, debussy, developed, his, own, style, of, harmony, and, orchestral, colouring, derided, and, unsuccessfully, resisted, by, much, of, the, musical, establishment, of, the, day, his, works, have, strongly, influenced, a, wide, range, of, composers, including, b, la, bart, k, olivier, messiaen, george, benjamin, and, the, jazz, pianist, and, composer, bill, evans, debussy, died, from, cancer, at, his,

with, c, sar, franck, the, course, included, music, history, and, theory, studies, with, louis, albert, bourgault, ducoudray, but, it, is, not, certain, that, debussy, who, was, apt, to, skip, classes, actually, attended, these, at, the, conservatoire, debussy, initially, made, good, progress, marmontel, said, of, him, a, charming, child, a, truly, artistic, temperament, much, can, be, expected, of, him, another, teacher, was, less, impressed, mile, durand, wrote, in, a, report, debussy, would, be, an, excellent, pupil, if, he, were, less, sketchy, and, less, cavalier, a, year, later, he, described, debussy, as, desperately, careless, in, july, 1874, debussy, received, the, award, of, deuxi, me, accessit, for, his, performance, as, soloist, in, the, first, movement, of, chopin, s, second, piano, concerto, at, the, conservatoire, s, annual, competition, he, was, a, fine, pianist, and, an, outstanding, sight, reader, who, could, have, had, a, professional, career, had, he, wished, but, he, was, only, intermittently, diligent, in, his, studies, he, advanced, to, premier, accessit, in, 1875, and, second, prize, in, 1877, but, failed, at, the, competitions, in, 1878, and, 1879, these, failures, made, him, ineligible, to, continue, in, the, conservatoire, s, piano, classes, but, he, remained, a, student, for, harmony, solf, ge, and, later, composition, with, marmontel, s, help, debussy, secured, a, summer, vacation, job, in, 1879, as, resident, pianist, at, the, ch, teau, de, chenonceau, where, he, rapidly, acquired, a, taste, for, luxury, that, was, to, remain, with, him, all, his, life, his, first, compositions, date, from, this, period, two, settings, of, poems, by, alfred, de, musset, ballade, la, lune, and, madrid, princesse, des, espagnes, the, following, year, he, secured, a, job, as, pianist, in, the, household, of, nadezhda, von, meck, the, patroness, of, tchaikovsky, he, travelled, with, her, family, for, the, summers, of, 1880, to, 1882, staying, at, various, places, in, france, switzerland, and, italy, as, well, as, at, her, home, in, moscow, he, composed, his, piano, trio, in, g, major, for, von, meck, s, ensemble, and, made, a, transcription, for, piano, duet, of, three, dances, from, tchaikovsky, s, swan, lake, at, the, end, of, 1880, debussy, while, continuing, his, studies, at, the, conservatoire, was, engaged, as, accompanist, for, marie, moreau, sainti, s, singing, class, he, took, this, role, for, four, years, among, the, members, of, the, class, was, marie, vasnier, debussy, was, greatly, taken, with, her, and, she, inspired, him, to, compose, he, wrote, 27, songs, dedicated, to, her, during, their, seven, year, relationship, she, was, the, wife, of, henri, vasnier, a, prominent, civil, servant, and, much, younger, than, her, husband, she, soon, became, debussy, s, lover, as, well, as, his, muse, whether, vasnier, was, content, to, tolerate, his, wife, s, affair, with, the, young, student, or, was, simply, unaware, of, it, is, not, clear, but, he, and, debussy, remained, on, excellent, terms, and, he, continued, to, encourage, the, composer, in, his, career, at, the, conservatoire, debussy, incurred, the, disapproval, of, the, faculty, particularly, his, composition, teacher, guiraud, for, his, failure, to, follow, the, orthodox, rules, of, composition, then, prevailing, nevertheless, in, 1884, debussy, won, france, s, most, prestigious, musical, award, the, prix, de, rome, with, his, cantata, l, enfant, prodigue, the, prix, carried, with, it, a, residence, at, the, villa, medici, the, french, academy, in, rome, to, further, the, winner, s, studies, debussy, was, there, from, january, 1885, to, march, 1887, with, three, or, possibly, four, absences, of, several, weeks, when, he, returned, to, france, chiefly, to, see, marie, vasnier, initially, debussy, found, the, artistic, atmosphere, of, the, villa, medici, stifling, the, company, boorish, the, food, bad, and, the, accommodation, abominable, neither, did, he, delight, in, italian, opera, as, he, found, the, operas, of, donizetti, and, verdi, not, to, his, taste, he, was, much, more, impressed, by, the, music, of, the, 16th, century, composers, palestrina, and, lassus, which, he, heard, at, santa, maria, dell, anima, the, only, church, music, i, will, accept, he, was, often, depressed, and, unable, to, compose, but, he, was, inspired, by, franz, liszt, who, visited, the, students, and, played, for, them, in, june, 1885, debussy, wrote, of, his, desire, to, follow, his, own, way, saying, i, am, sure, the, institute, would, not, approve, for, naturally, it, regards, the, path, which, it, ordains, as, the, only, right, one, but, there, is, no, help, for, it, i, am, too, enamoured, of, my, freedom, too, fond, of, my, own, ideas, debussy, finally, composed, four, pieces, that, were, submitted, to, the, academy, the, symphonic, ode, zuleima, based, on, a, text, by, heinrich, heine, the, orchestral, piece, printemps, the, cantata, la, damoiselle, lue, 1887, 1888, the, first, piece, in, which, the, stylistic, features, of, his, later, music, began, to, emerge, and, the, fantaisie, for, piano, and, orchestra, which, was, heavily, based, on, franck, s, music, and, was, eventually, withdrawn, by, debussy, the, academy, chided, him, for, writing, music, that, was, bizarre, incomprehensible, and, unperformable, although, debussy, s, works, showed, the, influence, of, jules, massenet, the, latter, concluded, he, is, an, enigma, during, his, years, in, rome, debussy, composed, not, for, the, academy, most, of, his, verlaine, cycle, ariettes, oubli, es, which, made, little, impact, at, the, time, but, was, successfully, republished, in, 1903, after, the, composer, had, become, well, known, a, week, after, his, return, to, paris, in, 1887, debussy, heard, the, first, act, of, wagner, s, tristan, und, isolde, at, the, concerts, lamoureux, and, judged, it, decidedly, the, finest, thing, i, know, in, 1888, and, 1889, he, went, to, the, annual, festivals, of, wagner, s, operas, at, bayreuth, he, responded, positively, to, wagner, s, sensuousness, mastery, of, form, and, striking, harmonies, and, was, briefly, influenced, by, them, but, unlike, some, other, french, composers, of, his, generation, he, concluded, that, there, was, no, future, in, attempting, to, adopt, and, develop, wagner, s, style, he, commented, in, 1903, that, wagner, was, a, beautiful, sunset, that, was, mistaken, for, a, dawn, in, 1889, at, the, paris, exposition, universelle, debussy, first, heard, javanese, gamelan, music, the, gamelan, scales, melodies, rhythms, and, ensemble, textures, appealed, to, him, and, echoes, of, them, are, heard, in, pagodes, in, his, piano, suite, estampes, he, also, attended, two, concerts, of, rimsky, korsakov, s, music, conducted, by, the, composer, this, too, made, an, impression, on, him, and, its, harmonic, freedom, and, non, teutonic, tone, colours, influenced, his, own, developing, musical, style, marie, vasnier, ended, her, liaison, with, debussy, soon, after, his, final, return, from, rome, although, they, remained, on, good, enough, terms, for, him, to, dedicate, to, her, one, more, song, mandoline, in, 1890, later, in, 1890, debussy, met, erik, satie, who, proved, a, kindred, spirit, in, his, experimental, approach, to, composition, both, were, bohemians, enjoying, the, same, caf, society, and, struggling, to, survive, financially, in, the, same, year, debussy, began, a, relationship, with, gabrielle, gaby, dupont, a, tailor, s, daughter, from, lisieux, in, july, 1893, they, began, living, together, debussy, continued, to, compose, songs, piano, pieces, and, other, works, some, of, which, were, publicly, performed, but, his, music, made, only, a, modest, impact, although, his, fellow, composers, recognised, his, potential, by, electing, him, to, the, committee, of, the, soci, t, nationale, de, musique, in, 1893, his, string, quartet, was, premiered, by, the, ysa, e, string, quartet, at, the, soci, t, nationale, in, the, same, year, in, may, 1893, debussy, attended, a, theatrical, event, that, was, of, key, importance, to, his, later, career, the, premiere, of, maurice, maeterlinck, s, play, pell, as, et, m, lisande, which, he, immediately, determined, to, turn, into, an, opera, he, travelled, to, maeterlinck, s, home, in, ghent, in, november, to, secure, his, consent, to, an, operatic, adaptation, in, february, 1894, debussy, completed, the, first, draft, of, act, i, of, his, operatic, version, of, pell, as, et, m, lisande, and, for, most, of, the, year, worked, to, complete, the, work, while, still, living, with, dupont, he, had, an, affair, with, the, singer, th, r, se, roger, and, in, 1894, he, announced, their, engagement, his, behaviour, was, widely, condemned, anonymous, letters, circulated, denouncing, his, treatment, of, both, women, as, well, as, his, financial, irresponsibility, and, debts, the, engagement, was, broken, off, and, several, of, debussy, s, friends, and, supporters, disowned, him, including, ernest, chausson, hitherto, one, of, his, strongest, supporters, in, terms, of, musical, recognition, debussy, made, a, step, forward, in, december, 1894, when, the, symphonic, poem, pr, lude, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, based, on, st, phane, mallarm, s, poem, was, premiered, at, a, concert, of, the, soci, t, nationale, the, following, year, he, completed, the, first, draft, of, pell, as, and, began, efforts, to, get, it, staged, in, may, 1898, he, made, his, first, contacts, with, andr, messager, and, albert, carr, respectively, the, musical, director, and, general, manager, of, the, op, ra, comique, paris, about, presenting, the, opera, debussy, abandoned, dupont, for, her, friend, marie, rosalie, texier, known, as, lilly, whom, he, married, in, october, 1899, after, threatening, suicide, if, she, refused, him, she, was, affectionate, practical, straightforward, and, well, liked, by, debussy, s, friends, and, associates, but, he, became, increasingly, irritated, by, her, intellectual, limitations, and, lack, of, musical, sensitivity, the, marriage, lasted, barely, five, years, from, around, 1900, debussy, s, music, became, a, focus, and, inspiration, for, an, informal, group, of, innovative, young, artists, poets, critics, and, musicians, who, began, meeting, in, paris, they, called, themselves, les, apaches, roughly, the, hooligans, to, represent, their, status, as, artistic, outcasts, the, membership, was, fluid, but, at, various, times, included, maurice, ravel, ricardo, vi, es, igor, stravinsky, and, manuel, de, falla, in, the, same, year, the, first, two, of, debussy, s, three, orchestral, nocturnes, were, first, performed, although, they, did, not, make, any, great, impact, with, the, public, they, were, well, reviewed, by, musicians, including, paul, dukas, alfred, bruneau, and, pierre, de, br, ville, the, complete, set, was, given, the, following, year, like, many, other, composers, of, the, time, debussy, supplemented, his, income, by, teaching, and, writing, for, most, of, 1901, he, had, a, sideline, as, music, critic, of, la, revue, blanche, adopting, the, pen, name, monsieur, croche, he, expressed, trenchant, views, on, composers, i, hate, sentimentality, his, name, is, camille, saint, sa, ns, institutions, on, the, paris, op, ra, a, stranger, would, take, it, for, a, railway, station, and, once, inside, would, mistake, it, for, a, turkish, bath, conductors, nikisch, is, a, unique, virtuoso, so, much, so, that, his, virtuosity, seems, to, make, him, forget, the, claims, of, good, taste, musical, politics, the, english, actually, think, that, a, musician, can, manage, an, opera, house, successfully, and, audiences, their, almost, drugged, expression, of, boredom, indifference, and, even, stupidity, he, later, collected, his, criticisms, with, a, view, to, their, publication, as, a, book, it, was, published, after, his, death, as, monsieur, croche, antidilettante, in, january, 1902, rehearsals, began, at, the, op, ra, comique, for, the, opening, of, pell, as, et, m, lisande, for, three, months, debussy, attended, rehearsals, practically, every, day, in, february, there, was, conflict, between, maeterlinck, on, the, one, hand, and, debussy, messager, and, carr, on, the, other, about, the, casting, of, m, lisande, maeterlinck, wanted, his, mistress, georgette, leblanc, to, sing, the, role, and, was, incensed, when, she, was, passed, over, in, favour, of, the, scottish, soprano, mary, garden, the, opera, opened, on, 30, april, 1902, and, although, the, first, night, audience, was, divided, between, admirers, and, sceptics, the, work, quickly, became, a, success, it, made, debussy, a, well, known, name, in, france, and, abroad, the, times, commented, that, the, opera, had, provoked, more, discussion, than, any, work, of, modern, times, excepting, of, course, those, of, richard, strauss, the, apaches, led, by, ravel, who, attended, every, one, of, the, 14, performances, in, the, first, run, were, loud, in, their, support, the, conservative, faculty, of, the, conservatoire, tried, in, vain, to, stop, its, students, from, seeing, the, opera, the, vocal, score, was, published, in, early, may, and, the, full, orchestral, score, in, 1904, in, 1903, there, was, public, recognition, of, debussy, s, stature, when, he, was, appointed, a, chevalier, of, the, l, gion, d, honneur, but, his, social, standing, suffered, a, great, blow, when, another, turn, in, his, private, life, caused, a, scandal, the, following, year, one, of, his, pupils, was, raoul, bardac, son, of, emma, and, her, husband, parisian, banker, sigismond, bardac, raoul, introduced, his, teacher, to, his, mother, to, whom, debussy, quickly, became, greatly, attracted, she, was, sophisticated, a, brilliant, conversationalist, an, accomplished, singer, and, relaxed, about, marital, fidelity, having, been, the, mistress, and, muse, of, gabriel, faur, a, few, years, earlier, after, despatching, lilly, to, her, parental, home, at, bichain, in, villeneuve, la, guyard, on, 15, july, 1904, debussy, took, emma, away, staying, incognito, in, jersey, and, then, at, pourville, in, normandy, he, wrote, to, his, wife, on, 11, august, from, dieppe, telling, her, that, their, marriage, was, over, but, still, making, no, mention, of, bardac, when, he, returned, to, paris, he, set, up, home, on, his, own, taking, a, flat, in, a, different, arrondissement, on, 14, october, five, days, before, their, fifth, wedding, anniversary, lilly, debussy, attempted, suicide, shooting, herself, in, the, chest, with, a, revolver, she, survived, although, the, bullet, remained, lodged, in, her, vertebrae, for, the, rest, of, her, life, the, ensuing, scandal, caused, bardac, s, family, to, disown, her, and, debussy, lost, many, good, friends, including, dukas, and, messager, his, relations, with, ravel, never, close, were, exacerbated, when, the, latter, joined, other, former, friends, of, debussy, in, contributing, to, a, fund, to, support, the, deserted, lilly, the, bardacs, divorced, in, may, 1905, finding, the, hostility, in, paris, intolerable, debussy, and, emma, now, pregnant, went, to, england, they, stayed, at, the, grand, hotel, eastbourne, in, july, and, august, where, debussy, corrected, the, proofs, of, his, symphonic, sketches, la, mer, celebrating, his, divorce, on, 2, august, after, a, brief, visit, to, london, the, couple, returned, to, paris, in, september, buying, a, house, in, a, courtyard, development, off, the, avenue, du, bois, de, boulogne, now, avenue, foch, debussy, s, home, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, october, 1905, la, mer, debussy, s, most, substantial, orchestral, work, was, premiered, in, paris, by, the, orchestre, lamoureux, under, the, direction, of, camille, chevillard, the, reception, was, mixed, some, praised, the, work, but, pierre, lalo, critic, of, le, temps, hitherto, an, admirer, of, debussy, wrote, i, do, not, hear, i, do, not, see, i, do, not, smell, the, sea, in, the, same, month, the, composer, s, only, child, was, born, at, their, home, claude, emma, affectionately, known, as, chouchou, was, a, musical, inspiration, to, the, composer, she, was, the, dedicatee, of, his, children, s, corner, suite, she, outlived, her, father, by, scarcely, a, year, succumbing, to, the, diphtheria, epidemic, of, 1919, mary, garden, said, i, honestly, don, t, know, if, debussy, ever, loved, anybody, really, he, loved, his, music, and, perhaps, himself, i, think, he, was, wrapped, up, in, his, genius, but, biographers, are, agreed, that, whatever, his, relations, with, lovers, and, friends, debussy, was, devoted, to, his, daughter, debussy, and, emma, bardac, eventually, married, in, 1908, their, troubled, union, enduring, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, following, year, began, well, when, at, faur, s, invitation, debussy, became, a, member, of, the, governing, council, of, the, conservatoire, his, success, in, london, was, consolidated, in, april, 1909, when, he, conducted, pr, lude, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, and, the, nocturnes, at, the, queen, s, hall, in, may, he, was, present, at, the, first, london, production, of, pell, as, et, m, lisande, at, covent, garden, in, the, same, year, debussy, was, diagnosed, with, colorectal, cancer, from, which, he, was, to, die, nine, years, later, debussy, s, works, began, to, feature, increasingly, in, concert, programmes, at, home, and, overseas, in, 1910, gustav, mahler, conducted, the, nocturnes, and, pr, lude, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, in, new, york, in, successive, months, in, the, same, year, visiting, budapest, debussy, commented, that, his, works, were, better, known, there, than, in, paris, in, 1912, sergei, diaghilev, commissioned, a, new, ballet, score, jeux, that, and, the, three, images, premiered, the, following, year, were, the, composer, s, last, orchestral, works, jeux, was, unfortunate, in, its, timing, two, weeks, after, the, premiere, in, march, 1913, diaghilev, presented, the, first, performance, of, stravinsky, s, the, rite, of, spring, a, sensational, event, that, monopolised, discussion, in, musical, circles, and, effectively, sidelined, jeux, along, with, faur, s, p, n, lope, which, had, opened, a, week, before, in, 1915, debussy, underwent, one, of, the, earliest, colostomy, operations, it, achieved, only, a, temporary, respite, and, occasioned, him, considerable, frustration, there, are, mornings, when, the, effort, of, dressing, seems, like, one, of, the, twelve, labours, of, hercules, he, also, had, a, fierce, enemy, at, this, period, in, the, form, of, camille, saint, sa, ns, who, in, a, letter, to, faur, condemned, debussy, s, en, blanc, et, noir, it, s, incredible, and, the, door, of, the, institut, must, at, all, costs, be, barred, against, a, man, capable, of, such, atrocities, saint, sa, ns, had, been, a, member, of, the, institut, since, 1881, debussy, never, became, one, his, health, continued, to, decline, he, gave, his, final, concert, on, 14, september, 1917, and, became, bedridden, in, early, 1918, debussy, died, on, 25, march, 1918, at, his, home, the, first, world, war, was, still, raging, and, paris, was, under, german, aerial, and, artillery, bombardment, the, military, situation, did, not, permit, the, honour, of, a, public, funeral, with, ceremonious, graveside, orations, the, funeral, procession, made, its, way, through, deserted, streets, to, a, temporary, grave, at, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, as, the, german,

trees, and, the, birds, his, wife, and, daughter, are, buried, with, him, in, a, survey, of, debussy, s, oeuvre, shortly, after, the, composer, s, death, the, critic, ernest, newman, wrote, it, would, be, hardly, too, much, to, say, that, debussy, spent, a, third, of, his, life, in, the, discovery, of, himself, a, third, in, the, free, and, happy, realisation, of, himself, and, the, final, third, in, the, partial, painful, loss, of, himself, later, commentators, have, rated, some, of, the, late, works, more, highly, than, newman, and, other, contemporaries, did, but, much, of, the, music, for, which, debussy, is, best, known, is, from, the, middle, years, of, his, career, the, analyst, david, cox, wrote, in, 1974, that, debussy, admiring, wagner, s, attempts, to, combine, all, the, creative, arts, created, a, new, instinctive, dreamlike, world, of, music, lyrical, and, pantheistic, contemplative, and, objective, a, kind, of, art, in, fact, which, seemed, to, reach, out, into, all, aspects, of, experience, in, 1988, the, composer, and, scholar, wilfrid, mellers, wrote, of, debussy, because, of, rather, than, in, spite, of, his, preoccupation, with, chords, in, themselves, he, deprived, music, of, the, sense, of, harmonic, progression, broke, down, three, centuries, dominance, of, harmonic, tonality, and, showed, how, the, melodic, conceptions, of, tonality, typical, of, primitive, folk, music, and, of, medieval, music, might, be, relevant, to, the, twentieth, century, debussy, did, not, give, his, works, opus, numbers, apart, from, his, string, quartet, op, 10, in, g, minor, also, the, only, work, where, the, composer, s, title, included, a, key, his, works, were, catalogued, and, indexed, by, the, musicologist, fran, ois, lesure, in, 1977, revised, in, 2003, and, their, lesure, number, l, followed, by, a, number, is, sometimes, used, as, a, suffix, to, their, title, in, concert, programmes, and, recordings, debussy, s, musical, development, was, slow, and, as, a, student, he, was, adept, enough, to, produce, for, his, teachers, at, the, conservatoire, works, that, would, conform, to, their, conservative, precepts, his, friend, georges, jean, aubry, commented, that, debussy, admirably, imitated, massenet, s, melodic, turns, of, phrase, in, the, cantata, l, enfant, prodigue, 1884, which, won, him, the, prix, de, rome, a, more, characteristically, debussian, work, from, his, early, years, is, la, damoiselle, lue, recasting, the, traditional, form, for, oratorios, and, cantatas, using, a, chamber, orchestra, and, a, small, body, of, choral, tone, and, using, new, or, long, neglected, scales, and, harmonies, his, early, m, lodies, inspired, by, marie, vasnier, are, more, virtuosic, in, character, than, his, later, works, in, the, genre, with, extensive, wordless, vocalise, from, the, ariettes, oubli, es, 1885, 1887, onwards, he, developed, a, more, restrained, style, he, wrote, his, own, poems, for, the, proses, lyriques, 1892, 1893, but, in, the, view, of, the, musical, scholar, robert, orledge, his, literary, talents, were, not, on, a, par, with, his, musical, imagination, the, musicologist, jacques, gabriel, prod, homme, wrote, that, together, with, la, demoiselle, lue, the, ariettes, oubli, es, and, the, cinq, po, mes, de, charles, baudelaire, 1889, show, the, new, strange, way, which, the, young, musician, will, hereafter, follow, newman, concurred, there, is, a, good, deal, of, wagner, especially, of, tristan, in, the, idiom, but, the, work, as, a, whole, is, distinctive, and, the, first, in, which, we, get, a, hint, of, the, debussy, we, were, to, know, later, the, lover, of, vague, outlines, of, half, lights, of, mysterious, consonances, and, dissonances, of, colour, the, apostle, of, languor, the, exclusivist, in, thought, and, in, style, during, the, next, few, years, debussy, developed, his, personal, style, without, at, this, stage, breaking, sharply, away, from, french, musical, traditions, much, of, his, music, from, this, period, is, on, a, small, scale, such, as, the, two, arabesques, valse, romantique, suite, bergamasque, and, the, first, set, of, f, tes, galantes, newman, remarked, that, like, chopin, the, debussy, of, this, period, appears, as, a, liberator, from, germanic, styles, of, composition, offering, instead, an, exquisite, pellucid, style, capable, of, conveying, not, only, gaiety, and, whimsicality, but, emotion, of, a, deeper, sort, in, a, 2004, study, mark, devoto, comments, that, debussy, s, early, works, are, harmonically, no, more, adventurous, than, existing, music, by, faur, in, a, 2007, book, about, the, piano, works, margery, halford, observes, that, two, arabesques, 1888, 1891, and, r, verie, 1890, have, the, fluidity, and, warmth, of, debussy, s, later, style, but, are, not, harmonically, innovative, halford, cites, the, popular, clair, de, lune, 1890, the, third, of, the, four, movements, of, suite, bergamasque, as, a, transitional, work, pointing, towards, the, composer, s, mature, style, musicians, from, debussy, s, time, onwards, have, regarded, pr, lude, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, 1894, as, his, first, orchestral, masterpiece, newman, considered, it, completely, original, in, idea, absolutely, personal, in, style, and, logical, and, coherent, from, first, to, last, without, a, superfluous, bar, or, even, a, superfluous, note, pierre, boulez, observed, modern, music, was, awakened, by, pr, lude, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, most, of, the, major, works, for, which, debussy, is, best, known, were, written, between, the, mid, 1890s, and, the, mid, 1900s, they, include, the, string, quartet, 1893, pell, as, et, m, lisande, 1893, 1902, the, nocturnes, for, orchestra, 1899, and, la, mer, 1903, 1905, the, suite, pour, le, piano, 1894, 1901, is, in, halford, s, view, one, of, the, first, examples, of, the, mature, debussy, as, a, composer, for, the, piano, a, major, landmark, and, an, enlargement, of, the, use, of, piano, sonorities, in, the, string, quartet, 1893, the, gamelan, sonorities, debussy, had, heard, four, years, earlier, are, recalled, in, the, pizzicatos, and, cross, rhythms, of, the, scherzo, debussy, s, biographer, edward, lockspeiser, comments, that, this, movement, shows, the, composer, s, rejection, of, the, traditional, dictum, that, string, instruments, should, be, predominantly, lyrical, the, work, influenced, ravel, whose, own, string, quartet, written, ten, years, later, has, noticeably, debussian, features, the, academic, and, journalist, stephen, walsh, calls, pell, as, et, m, lisande, begun, 1893, staged, 1902, a, key, work, for, the, 20th, century, the, composer, olivier, messiaen, was, fascinated, by, its, extraordinary, harmonic, qualities, and, transparent, instrumental, texture, the, opera, is, composed, in, what, alan, blyth, describes, as, a, sustained, and, heightened, recitative, style, with, sensuous, intimate, vocal, lines, it, influenced, composers, as, different, as, stravinsky, and, puccini, orledge, describes, the, nocturnes, as, exceptionally, varied, in, texture, ranging, from, the, musorgskian, start, of, nuages, through, the, approaching, brass, band, procession, in, f, tes, to, the, wordless, female, chorus, in, sir, nes, orledge, considers, the, last, a, pre, echo, of, the, marine, textures, of, la, mer, estampes, for, piano, 1903, gives, impressions, of, exotic, locations, with, further, echoes, of, the, gamelan, in, its, pentatonic, structures, debussy, believed, that, since, beethoven, the, traditional, symphonic, form, had, become, formulaic, repetitive, and, obsolete, the, three, part, cyclic, symphony, by, c, sar, franck, 1888, was, more, to, his, liking, and, its, influence, can, be, found, in, la, mer, 1905, this, uses, a, quasi, symphonic, form, its, three, sections, making, up, a, giant, sonata, form, movement, with, as, orledge, observes, a, cyclic, theme, in, the, manner, of, franck, the, central, jeux, de, vagues, section, has, the, function, of, a, symphonic, development, section, leading, into, the, final, dialogue, du, vent, et, de, la, mer, a, powerful, essay, in, orchestral, colour, and, sonority, orledge, which, reworks, themes, from, the, first, movement, the, reviews, were, sharply, divided, some, critics, thought, the, treatment, less, subtle, and, less, mysterious, than, his, previous, works, and, even, a, step, backward, others, praised, its, power, and, charm, its, extraordinary, verve, and, brilliant, fantasy, and, its, strong, colours, and, definite, lines, of, the, later, orchestral, works, images, 1905, 1912, is, better, known, than, jeux, 1913, the, former, follows, the, tripartite, form, established, in, the, nocturnes, and, la, mer, but, differs, in, employing, traditional, british, and, french, folk, tunes, and, in, making, the, central, movement, ib, ria, far, longer, than, the, outer, ones, and, subdividing, it, into, three, parts, all, inspired, by, scenes, from, spanish, life, although, considering, images, the, pinnacle, of, debussy, s, achievement, as, a, composer, for, orchestra, trezise, notes, a, contrary, view, that, the, accolade, belongs, to, the, ballet, score, jeux, the, latter, failed, as, a, ballet, because, of, what, jann, pasler, describes, as, a, banal, scenario, and, the, score, was, neglected, for, some, years, recent, analysts, have, found, it, a, link, between, traditional, continuity, and, thematic, growth, within, a, score, and, the, desire, to, create, discontinuity, in, a, way, mirrored, in, later, 20th, century, music, in, this, piece, debussy, abandoned, the, whole, tone, scale, he, had, often, favoured, previously, in, favour, of, the, octatonic, scale, with, what, the, debussy, scholar, fran, ois, lesure, describes, as, its, tonal, ambiguities, among, the, late, piano, works, are, two, books, of, pr, ludes, 1909, 10, 1911, 13, short, pieces, that, depict, a, wide, range, of, subjects, lesure, comments, that, they, range, from, the, frolics, of, minstrels, at, eastbourne, in, 1905, and, the, american, acrobat, general, lavine, to, dead, leaves, and, the, sounds, and, scents, of, the, evening, air, en, blanc, et, noir, in, white, and, black, 1915, a, three, movement, work, for, two, pianos, is, a, predominantly, sombre, piece, reflecting, the, war, and, national, danger, the, tudes, 1915, for, piano, have, divided, opinion, writing, soon, after, debussy, s, death, newman, found, them, laboured, a, strange, last, chapter, in, a, great, artist, s, life, lesure, writing, eighty, years, later, rates, them, among, debussy, s, greatest, late, works, behind, a, pedagogic, exterior, these, 12, pieces, explore, abstract, intervals, or, in, the, last, five, the, sonorities, and, timbres, peculiar, to, the, piano, in, 1914, debussy, started, work, on, a, planned, set, of, six, sonatas, for, various, instruments, his, fatal, illness, prevented, him, from, completing, the, set, but, those, for, cello, and, piano, 1915, flute, viola, and, harp, 1915, and, violin, and, piano, 1917, his, last, completed, work, are, all, concise, three, movement, pieces, more, diatonic, in, nature, than, some, of, his, other, late, works, le, martyre, de, saint, s, bastien, 1911, originally, a, five, act, musical, play, to, a, text, by, gabriele, d, annunzio, that, took, nearly, five, hours, in, performance, was, not, a, success, and, the, music, is, now, more, often, heard, in, a, concert, or, studio, adaptation, with, narrator, or, as, an, orchestral, suite, of, fragments, symphoniques, debussy, enlisted, the, help, of, andr, caplet, in, orchestrating, and, arranging, the, score, two, late, stage, works, the, ballets, khamma, 1912, and, la, bo, te, joujoux, 1913, were, left, with, the, orchestration, incomplete, and, were, completed, by, charles, koechlin, and, caplet, respectively, the, application, of, the, term, impressionist, to, debussy, and, the, music, he, influenced, has, been, much, debated, both, during, his, lifetime, and, since, the, analyst, richard, langham, smith, writes, that, impressionism, was, originally, a, term, coined, to, describe, a, style, of, late, 19th, century, french, painting, typically, scenes, suffused, with, reflected, light, in, which, the, emphasis, is, on, the, overall, impression, rather, than, outline, or, clarity, of, detail, as, in, works, by, monet, pissarro, renoir, and, others, langham, smith, writes, that, the, term, became, transferred, to, the, compositions, of, debussy, and, others, which, were, concerned, with, the, representation, of, landscape, or, natural, phenomena, particularly, the, water, and, light, imagery, dear, to, impressionists, through, subtle, textures, suffused, with, instrumental, colour, among, painters, debussy, particularly, admired, turner, but, also, drew, inspiration, from, whistler, with, the, latter, in, mind, the, composer, wrote, to, the, violinist, eug, ne, ysa, e, in, 1894, describing, the, orchestral, nocturnes, as, an, experiment, in, the, different, combinations, that, can, be, obtained, from, one, colour, what, a, study, in, grey, would, be, in, painting, debussy, strongly, objected, to, the, use, of, the, word, impressionism, for, his, or, anybody, else, s, music, but, it, has, continually, been, attached, to, him, since, the, assessors, at, the, conservatoire, first, applied, it, opprobriously, to, his, early, work, printemps, langham, smith, comments, that, debussy, wrote, many, piano, pieces, with, titles, evocative, of, nature, reflets, dans, l, eau, 1905, les, sons, et, les, parfums, tournent, dans, l, air, du, soir, 1910, and, brouillards, 1913, and, suggests, that, the, impressionist, painters, use, of, brush, strokes, and, dots, is, paralleled, in, the, music, of, debussy, although, debussy, said, that, anyone, using, the, term, whether, about, painting, or, music, was, an, imbecile, some, debussy, scholars, have, taken, a, less, absolutist, line, lockspeiser, calls, la, mer, the, greatest, example, of, an, orchestral, impressionist, work, and, more, recently, in, the, cambridge, companion, to, debussy, nigel, simeone, comments, it, does, not, seem, unduly, far, fetched, to, see, a, parallel, in, monet, s, seascapes, in, this, context, may, be, placed, debussy, s, pantheistic, eulogy, to, nature, in, a, 1911, interview, with, henry, malherbe, i, have, made, mysterious, nature, my, religion, when, i, gaze, at, a, sunset, sky, and, spend, hours, contemplating, its, marvellous, ever, changing, beauty, an, extraordinary, emotion, overwhelms, me, nature, in, all, its, vastness, is, truthfully, reflected, in, my, sincere, though, feeble, soul, around, me, are, the, trees, stretching, up, their, branches, to, the, skies, the, perfumed, flowers, gladdening, the, meadow, the, gentle, grass, carpeted, earth, and, my, hands, unconsciously, assume, an, attitude, of, adoration, in, contrast, to, the, impressionistic, characterisation, of, debussy, s, music, several, writers, have, suggested, that, he, structured, at, least, some, of, his, music, on, rigorous, mathematical, lines, in, 1983, the, pianist, and, scholar, roy, howat, published, a, book, contending, that, certain, of, debussy, s, works, are, proportioned, using, mathematical, models, even, while, using, an, apparent, classical, structure, such, as, sonata, form, howat, suggests, that, some, of, debussy, s, pieces, can, be, divided, into, sections, that, reflect, the, golden, ratio, which, is, approximated, by, ratios, of, consecutive, numbers, in, the, fibonacci, sequence, simon, trezise, in, his, 1994, book, debussy, la, mer, finds, the, intrinsic, evidence, remarkable, with, the, caveat, that, no, written, or, reported, evidence, suggests, that, debussy, deliberately, sought, such, proportions, lesure, takes, a, similar, view, endorsing, howat, s, conclusions, while, not, taking, a, view, on, debussy, s, conscious, intentions, debussy, wrote, we, must, agree, that, the, beauty, of, a, work, of, art, will, always, remain, a, mystery, we, can, never, be, absolutely, sure, how, it, s, made, we, must, at, all, costs, preserve, this, magic, which, is, peculiar, to, music, and, to, which, music, by, its, nature, is, of, all, the, arts, the, most, receptive, nevertheless, there, are, many, indicators, of, the, sources, and, elements, of, debussy, s, idiom, writing, in, 1958, the, critic, rudolph, reti, summarised, six, features, of, debussy, s, music, which, he, asserted, established, a, new, concept, of, tonality, in, european, music, the, frequent, use, of, lengthy, pedal, points, not, merely, bass, pedals, in, the, actual, sense, of, the, term, but, sustained, pedals, in, any, voice, glittering, passages, and, webs, of, figurations, which, distract, from, occasional, absence, of, tonality, frequent, use, of, parallel, chords, which, are, in, essence, not, harmonies, at, all, but, rather, chordal, melodies, enriched, unisons, described, by, some, writers, as, non, functional, harmonies, bitonality, or, at, least, bitonal, chords, use, of, the, whole, tone, and, pentatonic, scales, and, unprepared, modulations, without, any, harmonic, bridge, reti, concludes, that, debussy, s, achievement, was, the, synthesis, of, monophonic, based, melodic, tonality, with, harmonies, albeit, different, from, those, of, harmonic, tonality, in, 1889, debussy, held, conversations, with, his, former, teacher, guiraud, which, included, exploration, of, harmonic, possibilities, at, the, piano, the, discussion, and, debussy, s, chordal, keyboard, improvisations, were, noted, by, a, younger, pupil, of, guiraud, maurice, emmanuel, the, chord, sequences, played, by, debussy, include, some, of, the, elements, identified, by, reti, they, may, also, indicate, the, influence, on, debussy, of, satie, s, 1887, trois, sarabandes, a, further, improvisation, by, debussy, during, this, conversation, included, a, sequence, of, whole, tone, harmonies, which, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, music, of, glinka, or, rimsky, korsakov, which, was, becoming, known, in, paris, at, this, time, during, the, conversation, debussy, told, guiraud, there, is, no, theory, you, have, only, to, listen, pleasure, is, the, law, although, he, also, conceded, i, feel, free, because, i, have, been, through, the, mill, and, i, don, t, write, in, the, fugal, style, because, i, know, it, chabrier, moussorgsky, palestrina, voil, ce, que, j, aime, they, are, what, i, love, debussy, in, 1893, among, french, predecessors, chabrier, was, an, important, influence, on, debussy, as, he, was, on, ravel, and, poulenc, howat, has, written, that, chabrier, s, piano, music, such, as, sous, bois, and, mauresque, in, the, pi, ces, pittoresques, explored, new, sound, worlds, of, which, debussy, made, effective, use, 30, years, later, lesure, finds, traces, of, gounod, and, massenet, in, some, of, debussy, s, early, songs, and, remarks, that, it, may, have, been, from, the, russians, tchaikovsky, balakirev, rimsky, korsakov, borodin, and, mussorgsky, that, debussy, acquired, his, taste, for, ancient, and, oriental, modes, and, for, vivid, colorations, and, a, certain, disdain, for, academic, rules, lesure, also, considers, that, mussorgsky, s, opera, boris, godunov, directly, influenced, debussy, s, pell, as, et, m, lisande, in, the, music, of, palestrina, debussy, found, what, he, called, a, perfect, whiteness, and, he, felt, that, although, palestrina, s, musical, forms, had, a, strict, manner, they, were, more, to, his, taste, than, the, rigid, rules, prevailing, among, 19th, century, french, composers, and, teachers, he, drew, inspiration, from, what, he, called, palestrina, s, harmony, created, by, melody, finding, an, arabesque, like, quality, in, the, melodic, lines, debussy, opined, that, chopin, was, the, greatest, of, them, all, for, through, the, piano, he, discovered, everything, he, professed, his, respectful, gratitude, for, chopin, s, piano, music, he, was, torn, between, dedicating, his, own, tudes, to, chopin, or, to, fran, ois, couperin, whom, he, also, admired, as, a, model, of, form, seeing, himself, as, heir, to, their, mastery, of, the, genre, howat, cautions, against, the, assumption, that, debussy, s, ballade, 1891, and, nocturne, 1892, are, influenced, by, chopin, in, howat, s, view, they, owe, more, to, debussy, s, early, russian, models, but, chopin, s, influence, is, found, in, other, early, works, such, as, the, two, arabesques, 1889, 1891, in, 1914, the, publisher, a, durand, fils, began, publishing, scholarly, new, editions, of, the, works, of, major, composers, and, debussy, undertook, the, supervision, of, the, editing, of, chopin, s, music, although, debussy, was, in, no, doubt, of, wagner, s, stature, he, was, only, briefly, influenced, by, him, in, his, compositions, after, la, damoiselle, lue, and, the, cinq, po, mes, de, baudelaire, both, begun, in, 1887, according, to, pierre, lou, s, debussy, did, not, see, what, anyone, can, do, beyond, tristan, although, he, admitted, that, it, was, sometimes, difficult, to, avoid, the, ghost, of, old, klingsor, alias, richard, wagner, appearing, at, the, turning, of, a, bar, after, debussy, s, short, wagnerian, phase, he, started, to, become, interested, in, non, western, music, and, its, unfamiliar, approaches, to, composition, the, piano, piece, golliwogg, s, cakewalk, from, the, 1908, suite, children, s, corner, contains, a, parody, of, music, from, the, introduction, to, tristan, in, which, in, the, opinion, of, the, musicologist, lawrence, kramer, debussy, escapes, the, shadow, of, the, older, composer, and, smilingly, relativizes, wagner, into, insignificance, a, contemporary, influence, was, erik, satie, according, to, nichols, debussy, s, most, faithful, friend, amongst, french, musicians, debussy, s, orchestration, in, 1896, of, satie, s, gymnop, dies, which, had, been, written, in, 1887, put, their, composer, on, the, map, according, to, the, musicologist, richard, taruskin, and, the, sarabande, from, debussy, s, pour, le, piano, 1901, shows, that, knew, satie, s, trois, sarabandes, at, a, time, when, only, a, personal, friend, of, the, composer, could, have, known, them, they, were, not, published, until, 1911, debussy, s, interest, in, the, popular, music, of, his, time, is, evidenced, not, only, by, the, golliwogg, s, cakewalk, and, other, piano, pieces, featuring, rag, time, such, as, the, little, nigar, debussy, s, spelling, 1909, but, by, the, slow, waltz, la, plus, que, lente, the, more, than, slow, based, on, the, style, of, the, gipsy, violinist, at, a, paris, hotel, to, whom, he, gave, the, manuscript, of, the, piece, in, addition, to, the, composers, who, influenced, his, own, compositions, debussy, held, strong, views, about, several, others, he, was, for, the, most, part, enthusiastic, about, richard, strauss, and, stravinsky, respectful, of, mozart, and, was, in, awe, of, bach, whom, he, called, the, good, god, of, music, le, bon, dieu, de, la, musique, his, relationship, to, beethoven, was, complex, he, was, said, to, refer, to, him, as, le, vieux, sourd, the, old, deaf, one, and, asked, one, young, pupil, not, to, play, beethoven, s, music, for, it, is, like, somebody, dancing, on, my, grave, but, he, believed, that, beethoven, had, profound, things, to, say, yet, did, not, know, how, to, say, them, because, he, was, imprisoned, in, a, web, of, incessant, restatement, and, of, german, aggressiveness, he, was, not, in, sympathy, with, schubert, schumann, brahms, and, mendelssohn, the, latter, being, described, as, a, facile, and, elegant, notary, with, the, advent, of, the, first, world, war, debussy, became, ardently, patriotic, in, his, musical, opinions, writing, to, stravinsky, he, asked, how, could, we, not, have, foreseen, that, these, men, were, plotting, the, destruction, of, our, art, just, as, they, had, planned, the, destruction, of, our, country, in, 1915, he, complained, that, since, rameau, we, have, had, no, purely, french, tradition, we, tolerated, overblown, orchestras, tortuous, forms, we, were, about, to, give, the, seal, of, approval, to, even, more, suspect, naturalizations, when, the, sound, of, gunfire, put, a, sudden, stop, to, it, all, taruskin, writes, that, some, have, seen, this, as, a, reference, to, the, composers, gustav, mahler, and, arnold, schoenberg, both, born, jewish, in, 1912, debussy, had, remarked, to, his, publisher, of, the, opera, ariane, et, barbe, bleue, by, the, also, jewish, composer, paul, dukas, you, re, right, is, a, masterpiece, but, it, s, not, a, masterpiece, of, french, music, on, the, other, hand, charles, rosen, argued, in, a, review, of, taruskin, s, work, that, debussy, was, instead, implying, that, opera, was, too, wagnerian, too, german, to, fit, his, ideal, of, french, style, citing, georges, li, bert, one, of, the, editors, of, debussy, s, collected, correspondence, as, an, authority, saying, that, debussy, was, not, antisemitic, despite, his, lack, of, formal, schooling, debussy, read, widely, and, found, inspiration, in, literature, lesure, writes, the, development, of, free, verse, in, poetry, and, the, disappearance, of, the, subject, or, model, in, painting, influenced, him, to, think, about, issues, of, musical, form, debussy, was, influenced, by, the, symbolist, poets, these, writers, who, included, verlaine, mallarm, maeterlinck, and, rimbaud, reacted, against, the, realism, naturalism, objectivity, and, formal, conservatism, that, prevailed, in, the, 1870s, they, favoured, poetry, using, suggestion, rather, than, direct, statement, the, literary, scholar, chris, baldrick, writes, that, they, evoked, subjective, moods, through, the, use, of, private, symbols, while, avoiding, the, description, of, external, reality, or, the, expression, of, opinion, debussy, was, much, in, sympathy, with, the, symbolists, desire, to, bring, poetry, closer, to, music, became, friendly, with, several, leading, exponents, and, set, many, symbolist, works, throughout, his, career, debussy, s, literary, inspirations, were, mostly, french, but, he, did, not, overlook, foreign, writers, as, well, as, maeterlinck, for, pell, as, et, m, lisande, he, drew, on, shakespeare, and, dickens, for, two, of, his, pr, ludes, for, piano, la, danse, de, puck, book, 1, 1910, and, hommage, s, pickwick, esq, p, p, m, p, c, book, 2, 1913, he, set, dante, gabriel, rossetti, s, the, blessed, damozel, in, his, early, cantata, la, damoiselle, lue, 1888, he, wrote, incidental, music, for, king, lear, and, planned, an, opera, based, on, as, you, like, it, but, abandoned, that, once, he, turned, his, attention, to, setting, maeterlinck, s, play, in, 1890, he, began, work, on, an, orchestral, piece, inspired, by, edgar, allan, poe, s, the, fall, of, the, house, of, usher, and, later, sketched, the, libretto, for, an, opera, la, chute, de, la, maison, usher, another, project, inspired, by, poe, an, operatic, version, of, the, devil, in, the, belfry, did, not, progress, beyond, sketches, french, writers, whose, words, he, set, include, paul, bourget, alfred, de, musset, th, odore, de, banville, leconte, de, lisle, th, ophile, gautier, paul, verlaine, fran, ois, villon, and, mallarm, the, last, of, whom, also, provided, debussy, with, the, inspiration, for, one, of, his, most, popular, orchestral, pieces, pr, lude, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, debussy, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, influential, composers, of, the, 20th, century, roger, nichols, writes, that, if, one, omits, schoenberg, a, list, of, 20th, century, composers, influenced, by, debussy, is, practically, a, list, of, 20th, century, composers, tout, court, bart, k, first, encountered, debussy, s, music, in, 1907, and, later, said, that, debussy, s, great, service, to, music, was, to, reawaken, among, all, musicians, an, awareness, of, harmony, and, its, possibilities, not, only, debussy, s, use, of, whole, tone, scales, but, also, his, style, of, word, setting, in, pell, as, et, m, lisande, were, the, subject, of, study, by, leo, jan, ek, while, he, was, writing, his, 1921, opera, k, a, kabanov, stravinsky, was, more, ambivalent, about, debussy, s, music, he, thought, pell, as, a, terrible, bore, in, spite, of, many, wonderful, pages, but, the, two, composers, knew, each, other, and, stravinsky, s, symphonies, of, wind, instruments, 1920, was, written, as, a, memorial, for, debussy, in, the, aftermath, of, the, first, world, war, the, young, french, composers, of, les, six, reacted, against, what, they, saw, as, the, poetic, mystical, quality, of, debussy, s, music, in, favour, of, something, more, hard, edged, their, sympathiser, and, self, appointed, spokesman, jean, cocteau, wrote, in, 1918, enough, of, nuages, waves, aquariums, ondines, and, nocturnal, perfumes, pointedly, alluding, to, the, titles, of, pieces, by, debussy, later, generations, of, french, composers, had, a, much, more, positive, relationship, with, his, music, messiaen, was, given, a, score, of, pell, as, et, m, lisande, as, a, boy, and, said, that, it, was, a, revelation, love, at, first, sight, and, probably, the, most, decisive, influence, i, have, been, subject, to, boulez, also, discovered, debussy, s, music, at, a, young, age, and, said, that, it, gave, him, his, first, sense, of, what, modernity, in, music, could, mean, among, contemporary, composers, george, benjamin, has, described, pr, lude, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, as, the, definition, of, perfection, he, has, conducted, pell, as, et, m, lisande, and, the, critic, rupert, christiansen, detects, the, influence, of, the, work, in, benjamin, s, opera, written, on, skin, 2012, others, have, made, orchestrations, of, some, of, the, piano, and, vocal, works, including, john, adams, s, version, of, four, of, the, baudelaire, songs, le, livre, de, baudelaire, 1994, robin, holloway, s, of, en, blanc, et, noir, 2002, and, colin, matthews, s, of, both, books, of, pr, ludes, 2001, 2006, the, pianist, stephen, hough, believes, that, debussy, s, influence, also, extends, to, jazz, and, suggests, that, reflets, dans, l, eau, can, be, heard, in, the, harmonies, of, bill, evans, in, 1904, debussy, played, the, piano, accompaniment, for, mary,
