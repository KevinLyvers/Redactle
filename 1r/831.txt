violations, a, quarter, million, in, 1943, and, more, than, 300, 000, during, the, next, year, historians, and, economists, differ, over, the, assessment, of, the, opa, activities, which, started, with, six, people, but, then, grew, to, 15, 000, staffers, some, of, them, point, to, the, fact, that, price, increases, were, relatively, lower, than, during, the, first, world, war, and, that, the, overall, economy, grew, faster, steven, pressman, for, example, wrote, that, when, the, controls, were, removed, there, was, only, a, small, increase, in, prices, thereby, demonstrating, that, inflationary, pressures, were, actively, managed, and, not, just, kept, temporarily, under, control, galbraith, said, in, an, interview, that, he, considered, his, work, at, the, opa, as, his, major, life, achievement, since, prices, were, relatively, stable, during, wwii, the, role, of, the, opa, however, as, well, as, the, whole, legacy, of, the, us, government, wartime, economic, stabilization, measures, from, a, long, term, perspective, remains, debated, richard, parker, who, earlier, had, written, a, well, regarded, biography, of, galbraith, had, this, to, say, about, galbraith, s, efforts, during, the, war, e, had, first, gone, to, work, in, the, nation, s, capital, in, 1934, as, a, 25, year, old, fresh, out, of, graduate, school, and, just, about, to, join, the, harvard, faculty, as, a, young, instructor, he, had, returned, to, washington, in, mid, 1940, after, paris, fell, to, the, germans, initially, to, help, ready, the, nation, for, war, eighteen, months, later, after, pearl, harbor, he, was, then, appointed, to, oversee, the, wartime, economy, as, price, czar, charged, with, preventing, inflation, and, corrupt, price, gouging, from, devastating, the, economy, as, it, swelled, to, produce, the, weapons, and, materiel, needed, to, guarantee, victory, against, fascism, in, this, he, and, his, colleagues, at, the, office, of, price, administration, had, been, stunningly, successful, guiding, an, economy, that, quadrupled, in, size, in, less, than, five, years, without, fanning, the, inflation, that, had, haunted, world, war, i, or, leaving, behind, an, unbalanced, post, war, collapse, of, the, kind, that, had, done, such, grievous, damage, to, europe, in, the, 1920s, opposition, to, the, opa, came, from, conservatives, in, congress, and, the, business, community, it, undercut, galbraith, and, he, was, forced, out, in, may, 1943, accused, of, communistic, tendencies, he, was, promptly, hired, by, henry, luce, a, conservative, republican, and, a, dominant, figure, in, american, media, as, publisher, of, time, and, fortune, magazines, galbraith, worked, for, luce, for, five, years, and, expounded, keynesianism, to, the, american, business, leadership, luce, allegedly, said, to, president, kennedy, i, taught, galbraith, how, to, write, and, have, regretted, it, ever, since, galbraith, saw, his, role, as, educating, the, entire, nation, on, how, the, economy, worked, including, the, role, of, big, corporations, he, was, combining, his, writing, with, numerous, speeches, to, business, groups, and, local, democratic, party, meetings, as, well, as, frequently, testifying, before, congress, during, the, late, stages, of, wwii, in, 1945, galbraith, was, invited, by, paul, nitze, to, serve, as, one, of, the, officers, of, the, strategic, bombing, survey, initiated, by, the, office, of, strategic, services, it, was, designed, to, assess, the, results, of, the, aerial, bombardments, of, nazi, germany, the, survey, found, that, german, war, production, went, up, rather, than, down, as, german, cities, were, being, bombed, henderson, 2006, wrote, galbraith, had, to, fight, hard, to, have, his, report, published, without, it, being, rewritten, to, hide, the, essential, points, i, defended, it, he, wrote, with, a, maximum, of, arrogance, and, a, minimum, of, tact, those, findings, created, a, controversy, with, nitze, siding, with, others, of, the, officers, managing, the, survey, and, with, pentagon, officials, who, declared, the, opposite, later, galbraith, described, the, willingness, of, public, servants, and, institutions, to, bend, the, truth, to, please, the, pentagon, as, the, pentagonania, syndrome, in, february, 1946, galbraith, took, a, leave, of, absence, from, his, magazine, work, for, a, senior, position, in, the, state, department, as, director, of, the, office, of, economic, security, policy, where, he, was, nominally, in, charge, of, economic, affairs, regarding, germany, japan, austria, and, south, korea, distrusted, by, senior, diplomats, he, was, relegated, to, routine, work, with, few, opportunities, to, make, policy, galbraith, favored, d, tente, with, the, soviet, union, along, with, secretary, of, state, james, f, byrnes, and, general, lucius, d, clay, a, military, governor, of, the, us, zone, in, germany, from, 1947, to, 1949, but, they, were, out, of, step, with, the, containment, policy, then, being, developed, by, george, kennan, and, favored, by, the, majority, of, the, us, major, policymakers, after, a, disconcerting, half, year, galbraith, resigned, in, september, 1946, and, went, back, to, his, magazine, writing, on, economics, issues, later, he, immortalized, his, frustration, with, the, ways, of, foggy, bottom, in, a, satirical, novel, the, triumph, 1968, the, postwar, period, also, was, memorable, for, galbraith, because, of, his, work, along, with, eleanor, roosevelt, and, hubert, humphrey, to, establish, a, progressive, policy, organization, americans, for, democratic, action, ada, in, support, of, the, cause, of, economic, and, social, justice, in, 1947, in, 1952, galbraith, s, friends, arthur, m, schlesinger, jr, and, george, ball, recruited, him, to, work, as, a, speechwriter, for, the, democratic, candidate, adlai, stevenson, the, involvement, of, several, intellectuals, from, the, ada, in, the, stevenson, campaign, attracted, controversy, as, the, republican, senator, joseph, mccarthy, accused, the, ada, intellectuals, as, being, tainted, by, well, documented, red, associations, galbraith, later, said, one, of, his, regrets, was, that, mccarthy, failed, to, condemn, him, as, one, of, stevenson, s, red, advisers, during, his, time, as, an, adviser, to, president, john, f, kennedy, galbraith, was, appointed, united, states, ambassador, to, india, from, 1961, to, 1963, his, rapport, with, kennedy, was, such, that, he, regularly, bypassed, the, state, department, and, sent, his, diplomatic, cables, directly, to, the, president, galbraith, disliked, his, superior, secretary, of, state, dean, rusk, writing, to, kennedy, that, trying, to, communicate, via, rusk, was, like, trying, to, fornicate, through, a, mattress, in, india, he, became, a, confidant, of, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, and, extensively, advised, the, indian, government, on, economic, matters, kennedy, considered, india, to, be, important, not, just, in, its, own, right, but, also, because, an, indian, diplomat, always, served, as, the, chief, commissioner, of, the, international, control, commission, icc, thus, galbraith, came, to, be, involved, in, american, policy, towards, southeast, asia, from, his, perch, as, an, ambassador, in, new, delhi, in, 1961, when, kennedy, considered, intervening, in, the, civil, war, in, laos, galbraith, strongly, advised, him, not, to, warning, him, that, the, disastrous, bay, of, pigs, invasion, had, been, caused, by, kennedy, taking, the, advice, offered, by, the, hawkish, joint, chiefs, of, staff, who, had, assured, him, that, the, invasion, could, not, fail, and, were, now, saying, the, same, about, the, proposed, intervention, in, laos, galbraith, also, noted, that, the, icc, was, also, responsible, for, laos, as, well, as, the, two, vietnams, and, he, had, nehru, s, word, that, the, indian, diplomats, on, the, icc, were, willing, to, serve, as, honest, brokers, for, a, peace, deal, to, make, laos, neutral, in, the, cold, war, in, may, 1961, the, indian, icc, members, had, been, able, to, broker, a, ceasefire, in, laos, and, kennedy, decided, to, go, for, the, neutralization, option, instead, of, war, during, the, talks, in, geneva, to, discuss, a, solution, to, the, lao, crisis, the, chief, american, delegate, w, averell, harriman, discovered, the, chinese, foreign, minister, chen, yi, was, willing, to, meet, him, in, private, however, rusk, forbade, harriman, to, talk, to, chen, under, any, circumstances, fearful, of, republican, attacks, against, the, democrat, kennedy, if, the, meetings, should, come, out, to, the, media, causing, harriman, to, explode, in, rage, that, during, world, war, ii, roosevelt, had, allowed, him, to, meet, whoever, was, necessary, unable, to, change, rusk, s, mind, harriman, appealed, to, galbraith, who, in, his, turn, appealed, to, kennedy, kennedy, granted, permission, for, harriman, to, meet, chen, provided, that, it, was, done, under, the, strictest, secrecy, but, by, that, time, chen, had, returned, to, beijing, in, may, 1961, when, vice, president, lyndon, johnson, visited, india, galbraith, had, the, duty, of, escorting, him, around, various, sites, in, india, and, attempting, to, explain, some, of, his, texas, mannerisms, such, as, his, shouts, of, yee, hah, that, he, made, when, he, saw, the, taj, mahal, which, confused, the, indians, from, the, embassy, in, new, delhi, galbraith, emerged, as, a, critic, of, the, increasing, american, involvement, in, vietnam, in, november, 1961, he, visited, south, vietnam, where, he, presented, an, unflattering, picture, of, the, regime, of, president, ngo, dinh, diem, saying, we, are, now, married, to, failure, he, advised, finding, a, new, south, vietnamese, leader, saying, nothing, succeeds, like, successors, in, may, 1962, galbraith, cabled, kennedy, stating, that, according, to, the, most, recent, statements, made, by, secretary, of, defense, robert, mcnamara, diem, had, about, 170, 000, men, under, arms, at, present, while, claiming, that, his, country, was, in, major, danger, from, 20, 000, lightly, armed, viet, cong, guerrillas, galbraith, proceeded, to, do, a, statistical, comparison, under, he, which, calculated, that, in, proportional, terms, diem, had, an, army, that, was, approximately, the, ratio, to, the, population, that, was, equivalent, to, that, of, the, u, s, army, to, the, american, people, after, the, civil, war, while, the, viet, cong, had, a, ratio, equivalent, to, that, of, the, sioux, vs, the, american, people, leading, galbraith, to, sarcastically, ask, why, diem, needed, more, american, support, he, concluded, his, cable, to, kennedy, incidentally, who, is, the, man, in, your, administration, who, decides, what, countries, are, strategic, i, would, like, to, have, his, name, and, address, and, ask, him, what, is, so, important, about, this, real, estate, in, the, space, age, in, january, 1963, when, polish, foreign, minister, adam, rapacki, visited, new, delhi, galbraith, met, with, him, to, declare, to, him, his, despair, about, kennedy, s, vietnam, policies, and, to, ask, that, poland, as, one, of, the, three, members, of, the, icc, try, help, find, a, diplomatic, solution, to, the, vietnam, war, galbraith, told, rapacki, that, he, favored, an, agreement, to, neutralize, the, two, vietnams, similar, to, the, neutralization, agreement, signed, for, laos, in, 1962, on, february, 5, 1963, przemys, aw, ogrodzi, ski, the, polish, ambassador, in, new, delhi, was, ordered, by, his, superiors, in, warsaw, as, far, as, the, vietnam, matter, we, are, discussing, it, it, was, received, with, interest, deliberations, will, continue, as, for, now, we, suggest, inviting, galbraith, to, lunch, and, sounding, out, without, committing, ourselves, in, order, for, him, to, see, that, we, are, looking, into, this, matter, although, galbraith, had, acted, on, his, own, in, approaching, rapacki, he, had, some, support, from, kennedy, who, told, him, to, pursue, the, subject, immediately, this, was, the, origin, of, the, maneli, affair, named, after, mieczys, aw, maneli, the, polish, commissioner, to, the, icc, who, together, with, ramchundur, goburdhun, the, indian, commissioner, on, the, icc, approached, leaders, in, both, north, and, south, vietnam, with, a, proposal, to, make, both, vietnams, neutral, in, the, cold, war, on, april, 1, 1963, galbraith, flew, to, washington, to, discuss, the, peace, proposal, with, kennedy, where, the, president, told, him, to, be, prepared, to, seize, upon, any, favorable, moment, to, reduce, our, commitment, though, it, might, yet, be, some, time, away, in, september, 1963, maneli, met, with, ng, nh, nhu, the, younger, brother, and, right, hand, man, of, president, diem, to, discuss, neutralization, a, meeting, that, was, leaked, to, the, right, wing, american, columnist, joseph, alsop, at, that, point, kennedy, lost, interest, in, the, maneli, affair, instead, deciding, to, back, an, alternative, option, he, had, been, considering, since, august, a, coup, against, the, ngo, brothers, while, in, india, he, helped, establish, one, of, the, first, computer, science, departments, at, the, indian, institute, of, technology, in, kanpur, uttar, pradesh, even, after, leaving, office, galbraith, remained, a, friend, and, supporter, of, india, because, of, his, recommendation, first, lady, of, the, united, states, jacqueline, bouvier, kennedy, undertook, her, 1962, diplomatic, missions, in, india, and, pakistan, after, leaving, the, american, embassy, in, india, galbraith, continued, to, advise, johnson, now, president, against, escalating, american, involvement, in, vietnam, in, 1965, he, advised, johnson, that, he, should, instruct, officials, and, spokesmen, to, stop, saying, the, future, of, mankind, the, united, states, and, human, liberty, is, being, decided, in, vietnam, it, isn, t, this, merely, builds, up, a, difficult, problem, out, of, all, proportion, it, is, also, terrible, politics, during, the, 1966, buddhist, crisis, in, south, vietnam, galbraith, wrote, johnson, a, letter, on, april, 3, saying, he, now, had, an, opportunity, only, the, god, fearing, deserve, and, only, the, extremely, lucky, get, saying, that, if, the, government, of, air, marshal, nguy, n, cao, k, should, fall, johnson, should, use, the, occasion, to, pull, all, americans, out, of, vietnam, on, june, 16, 1966, galbraith, offered, to, write, johnson, a, speech, that, would, set, out, an, orderly, withdrawal, of, american, forces, over, the, next, year, galbraith, advised, johnson, the, beginning, of, the, great, proletarian, cultural, revolution, in, china, represented, an, opportunity, for, a, diplomatic, settlement, of, the, vietnam, war, predicting, that, mao, zedong, would, lose, interest, in, vietnam, now, that, he, had, launched, his, cultural, revolution, the, national, security, adviser, w, w, rostow, wrote, the, reply, to, galbraith, that, was, signed, by, johnson, curtly, declaring, i, have, never, doubted, your, talent, for, political, craftsmanship, and, i, am, sure, you, could, devise, a, script, that, would, appear, to, justify, our, taking, an, unjustifiable, course, in, south, vietnam, on, june, 28, 1966, galbraith, made, his, final, attempt, to, change, johnson, s, mind, warning, that, the, vietnam, war, would, ruin, his, presidency, and, that, he, should, stop, taking, the, advice, of, rostow, galbraith, stated, that, johnson, had, the, potential, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, presidents, if, only, he, find, a, way, out, of, vietnam, and, concluded, the, people, who, want, to, invest, more, and, more, in, this, war, have, nothing, to, lose, they, will, end, up, working, for, a, foundation, in, 1966, when, he, was, no, longer, ambassador, he, told, the, united, states, senate, that, one, of, the, main, causes, of, the, 1965, kashmir, war, was, american, military, aid, to, pakistan, in, early, 1968, galbraith, endorsed, senator, eugene, mccarthy, who, ran, against, johnson, on, an, anti, war, platform, during, the, new, hampshire, democratic, primary, galbraith, toured, the, granite, state, giving, pro, mccarthy, speeches, in, churches, union, halls, campuses, and, house, parties, as, mccarthy, had, the, reputation, of, being, strange, and, frivolous, galbraith, s, support, and, campaigning, for, him, was, important, as, mccarthy, needed, the, endorsement, of, mainstream, figures, to, give, him, credibility, when, the, new, hampshire, democratic, primary, was, held, on, march, 12, 1968, johnson, defeated, mccarthy, by, only, about, 300, votes, a, humiliation, for, an, incumbent, president, with, a, well, funded, campaign, running, against, a, senator, widely, considered, to, be, too, eccentric, to, be, president, and, who, had, only, a, fraction, of, the, campaign, money, that, johnson, had, though, johnson, won, the, primary, the, very, narrow, margin, of, his, victory, was, widely, considered, to, be, a, defeat, on, the, night, of, the, primary, galbraith, celebrated, the, result, at, mccarthy, campaign, headquarters, as, if, it, were, an, outright, victory, the, day, after, the, new, hampshire, primary, galbraith, was, widely, cheered, by, his, students, when, he, entered, his, lecture, hall, at, harvard, the, results, of, the, new, hampshire, primary, showed, that, johnson, was, vulnerable, on, march, 16, 1968, senator, robert, f, kennedy, announced, he, was, entering, the, presidential, race, kennedy, asked, galbraith, to, withdraw, his, endorsement, of, mccarthy, and, to, endorse, him, instead, a, request, that, galbraith, refused, the, historian, arthur, m, schlesinger, jr, who, campaigned, with, galbraith, in, new, hampshire, for, mccarthy, switched, his, support, to, kennedy, on, the, grounds, that, kennedy, was, a, far, more, electable, candidate, than, the, eccentric, mccarthy, a, man, most, people, found, to, be, too, silly, to, be, president, schlesinger, strongly, urged, galbraith, to, support, kennedy, but, galbraith, chose, to, continue, to, campaign, for, mccarthy, partly, because, mccarthy, s, liberalism, was, closer, to, his, own, politics, and, partly, out, of, a, personal, revulsion, for, kennedy, who, had, only, opportunistically, entered, the, presidential, race, when, it, became, clear, that, johnson, was, not, invincible, galbraith, had, been, friends, with, john, kennedy, but, his, relations, with, robert, were, more, difficult, as, galbraith, found, robert, too, rigid, utterly, convinced, that, he, was, always, right, galbraith, later, said, that, with, robert, kennedy, you, were, either, for, the, cause, or, against, it, with, the, kennedys, or, a, leper, after, kennedy, was, assassinated, mccarthy, became, so, depressed, that, he, almost, dropped, out, of, the, election, and, galbraith, visited, several, times, to, urge, him, to, continue, through, galbraith, later, admitted, i, don, t, believe, eugene, mccarthy, s, heart, was, ever, wholly, in, the, battle, at, the, chaotic, and, violent, democratic, national, convention, in, august, 1968, in, chicago, galbraith, attended, as, the, floor, manager, for, the, mccarthy, campaign, amid, what, was, later, called, a, police, riot, as, the, chicago, police, fought, in, the, streets, with, anti, vietnam, war, protesters, galbraith, held, an, impromptu, speech, outside, the, hilton, hotel, before, a, group, of, demonstrators, urging, them, to, reject, violence, and, to, have, patience, while, assuring, them, that, the, american, system, was, capable, of, reform, and, change, galbraith, pointed, to, the, armed, illinois, national, guardsmen, standing, in, the, background, and, said, that, they, unlike, the, chicago, police, were, not, the, enemy, as, he, maintained, that, most, of, the, young, men, who, joined, the, illinois, national, guard, had, only, done, so, to, avoid, being, drafted, to, fight, in, vietnam, after, finishing, his, speech, a, national, guard, sergeant, approached, galbraith, who, froze, up, in, fear, as, he, believed, he, was, about, to, be, arrested, instead, the, sergeant, wanted, to, shake, hands, saying, thank, you, sir, that, was, the, first, nice, thing, anyone, has, said, about, us, all, week, at, the, convention, supporters, of, johnson, challenged, galbraith, s, right, to, serve, as, a, delegate, and, sought, to, expel, him, from, the, building, galbraith, quarreled, with, johnson, supporters, on, the, convention, floor, as, he, sought, to, add, a, peace, plank, to, the, democratic, platform, which, johnson, saw, as, an, insult, to, himself, and, ordered, the, delegates, to, reject, the, mayor, of, chicago, richard, daley, a, johnson, supporter, had, imposed, such, stringent, security, conditions, that, it, was, impossible, to, walk, across, the, convention, hall, without, jostling, somebody, else, which, added, to, the, tension, of, the, convention, as, pro, war, and, anti, war, democrats, fiercely, argued, about, the, platform, all, of, which, was, captured, live, on, national, television, adding, to, the, tension, were, televisions, on, the, convention, floor, that, showed, what, was, happening, outside, as, the, chicago, police, attacked, and, beat, anti, war, demonstrators, on, daley, s, orders, the, chicago, police, searched, galbraith, s, room, at, the, hilton, hotel, alleging, that, he, was, hiding, anti, war, protesters, none, were, found, after, vice, president, hubert, humphrey, won, the, democratic, nomination, galbraith, reluctantly, endorsed, humphrey, as, preferable, to, the, republican, candidate, richard, nixon, in, autumn, 1972, galbraith, was, an, adviser, and, assistant, to, nixon, s, rival, candidate, senator, george, mcgovern, in,

in, a, china, passage, writing, that, there, was, no, serious, doubt, that, china, is, devising, a, highly, effective, economic, system, issidents, are, brought, firmly, into, line, in, china, but, one, suspects, with, great, politeness, and, greater, shanghai, has, a, better, medical, service, than, new, york, he, considered, it, not, implausible, that, chinese, industrial, and, agricultural,

family, home, a, large, white, farm, house, still, stands, as, do, many, of, the, original, farm, buildings, even, before, becoming, a, president, of, the, american, economic, association, galbraith, was, considered, as, an, iconoclast, by, many, economists, this, is, partly, because, he, rejected, the, technical, analysis, and, mathematical, modelling, of, neoclassical, economics, as, being, divorced, from, reality, following, thorstein, veblen, he, believed, that, economic, activity, could, not, be, distilled, into, inviolable, laws, but, rather, was, a, complex, product, of, the, cultural, and, political, milieu, in, which, it, occurs, in, particular, he, posited, that, important, factors, such, as, the, separation, between, corporate, ownership, and, management, oligopoly, and, the, influence, of, government, and, military, spending, had, been, largely, neglected, by, most, economists, because, they, are, not, amenable, to, axiomatic, descriptions, in, this, sense, he, worked, as, much, in, political, economy, as, in, classical, economics, his, work, included, several, best, selling, books, throughout, the, fifties, and, sixties, his, major, contribution, to, the, field, of, economics, is, the, so, called, american, capitalism, trilogy, the, affluent, society, 1958, the, new, industrial, state, 1967, and, economics, and, the, public, purpose, 1973, written, in, a, clear, and, concise, style, they, were, comprehensible, to, lay, readers, not, just, economists, after, his, retirement, from, harvard, as, the, paul, m, warburg, professor, of, economics, emeritus, he, remained, in, the, public, spotlight, by, continuing, to, write, 21, new, books, as, well, as, completing, a, script, in, 1977, for, a, major, series, on, economics, for, pbs, and, bbc, television, the, age, of, uncertainty, broadcast, in, 38, countries, in, addition, to, his, books, he, wrote, hundreds, of, essays, and, a, number, of, novels, among, his, novels, a, tenured, professor, achieved, particular, critical, acclaim, galbraith, wrote, book, reviews, e, g, of, the, report, from, iron, mountain, on, the, possibility, and, desirability, of, peace, a, 1967, political, satire, under, the, pen, name, of, herschel, mclandress, a, name, of, a, fictional, scottish, mentor, featured, in, the, tenured, professor, he, also, used, the, pseudonym, mark, pernay, when, he, published, the, mclandress, dimension, in, 1963, galbraith, was, an, important, figure, in, 20th, century, institutional, economics, and, provided, an, exemplary, institutionalist, perspective, on, economic, power, among, his, numerous, writings, galbraith, cherished, the, new, industrial, state, and, the, affluent, society, as, his, two, best, as, for, the, later, works, economist, and, galbraith, friend, mike, sharpe, visited, him, in, 2004, on, which, occasion, galbraith, gave, sharpe, a, copy, of, what, would, be, galbraith, s, last, book, the, economics, of, innocent, fraud, galbraith, confided, in, sharpe, that, this, is, my, best, book, an, assertion, galbraith, delivered, a, little, mischievously, after, the, beginning, of, the, great, recession, of, 2008, galbraith, s, the, great, crash, 1929, 1955, and, other, books, containing, warnings, about, the, dangers, of, an, unrestrained, speculative, mood, without, proper, government, oversight, found, an, attentive, readership, again, in, 2010, the, library, of, america, published, a, new, edition, of, galbraith, s, major, works, edited, by, his, son, james, k, galbraith, the, affluent, society, other, writings, 1952, 1967, american, capitalism, the, great, crash, 1929, the, affluent, society, and, the, new, industrial, state, on, this, occasion, bill, moyers, interviewed, james, k, galbraith, about, his, father, his, works, and, his, legacy, in, american, capitalism, the, concept, of, countervailing, power, published, in, 1952, galbraith, concluded, that, the, american, economy, was, managed, by, a, triumvirate, of, big, business, big, labor, and, an, activist, government, galbraith, defined, the, actions, of, the, industry, lobby, groups, and, unions, as, countervailing, power, he, contrasted, this, arrangement, with, the, period, prior, to, the, previous, depression, when, big, business, had, relatively, free, rein, over, the, economy, his, 1955, bestseller, the, great, crash, 1929, describes, the, wall, street, meltdown, of, stock, prices, and, how, markets, progressively, become, decoupled, from, reality, in, a, speculative, boom, the, book, is, also, a, platform, for, galbraith, s, humor, and, keen, insights, into, human, behavior, when, wealth, is, threatened, it, has, never, been, out, of, print, in, the, affluent, society, 1958, which, became, a, bestseller, galbraith, outlined, his, view, that, to, become, successful, post, world, war, ii, america, should, make, large, investments, in, items, such, as, highways, and, education, using, funds, from, general, taxation, galbraith, also, critiqued, the, assumption, that, continually, increasing, material, production, is, a, sign, of, economic, and, societal, health, because, of, this, galbraith, is, sometimes, considered, one, of, the, first, post, materialists, in, this, book, he, popularized, the, old, phrase, conventional, wisdom, galbraith, worked, on, the, book, while, in, switzerland, and, had, originally, titled, it, why, the, poor, are, poor, but, changed, it, to, the, affluent, society, at, his, wife, s, suggestion, the, affluent, society, contributed, likely, to, a, significant, degree, given, that, galbraith, had, the, ear, of, president, kennedy, to, the, war, on, poverty, the, government, spending, policy, introduced, by, the, administrations, of, kennedy, and, johnson, in, 1966, galbraith, was, invited, by, the, bbc, to, present, the, reith, lectures, a, series, of, radio, broadcasts, which, he, titled, the, new, industrial, state, across, six, broadcasts, he, explored, the, economics, of, production, and, the, effect, large, corporations, could, have, over, the, state, in, the, print, edition, of, the, new, industrial, state, 1967, galbraith, expanded, his, analysis, of, the, role, of, power, in, economic, life, arguing, that, very, few, industries, in, the, united, states, fit, the, model, of, perfect, competition, a, central, concept, of, the, book, is, the, revised, sequence, the, conventional, wisdom, in, economic, thought, portrays, economic, life, as, a, set, of, competitive, markets, governed, ultimately, by, the, decisions, of, sovereign, consumers, in, this, original, sequence, the, control, of, the, production, process, flows, from, consumers, of, commodities, to, the, organizations, that, produce, those, commodities, in, the, revised, sequence, this, flow, is, reversed, and, businesses, exercise, control, over, consumers, by, advertising, and, related, salesmanship, activities, the, revised, sequence, concept, applies, only, to, the, industrial, system, that, is, the, manufacturing, core, of, the, economy, in, which, each, industry, contains, only, a, handful, of, very, powerful, corporations, it, does, not, apply, to, the, market, system, in, the, galbraithian, dual, economy, in, the, market, system, composed, of, the, vast, majority, of, business, organizations, price, competition, remains, the, dominant, form, of, social, control, in, the, industrial, system, however, composed, of, the, 1, 000, or, so, large, corporations, competitive, price, theory, obscures, the, relation, to, the, price, system, of, these, large, and, powerful, corporations, in, galbraith, s, view, the, principal, function, of, market, relations, in, this, industrial, system, is, not, to, constrain, the, power, of, the, corporate, behemoths, but, to, serve, as, an, instrument, for, the, implementation, of, their, power, moreover, the, power, of, these, corporations, extends, into, commercial, culture, and, politics, allowing, them, to, exercise, considerable, influence, upon, popular, social, attitudes, and, value, judgments, that, this, power, is, exercised, in, the, shortsighted, interest, of, expanding, commodity, production, and, the, status, of, the, few, is, both, inconsistent, with, democracy, and, a, barrier, to, achieving, the, quality, of, life, that, the, new, industrial, state, with, its, affluence, could, provide, the, new, industrial, state, not, only, provided, galbraith, with, another, best, selling, book, it, also, extended, once, again, the, currency, of, institutionalist, economic, thought, the, book, also, filled, a, very, pressing, need, in, the, late, 1960s, the, conventional, theory, of, monopoly, power, in, economic, life, maintains, that, the, monopolist, will, attempt, to, restrict, supply, in, order, to, maintain, price, above, its, competitive, level, the, social, cost, of, this, monopoly, power, is, a, decrease, in, both, allocative, efficiency, and, the, equity, of, income, distribution, this, conventional, economic, analysis, of, the, role, of, monopoly, power, did, not, adequately, address, popular, concern, about, the, large, corporation, in, the, late, 1960s, the, growing, concern, focused, on, the, role, of, the, corporation, in, politics, the, damage, done, to, the, natural, environment, by, an, unmitigated, commitment, to, economic, growth, and, the, perversion, of, advertising, and, other, pecuniary, aspects, of, culture, the, new, industrial, state, gave, a, plausible, explanation, of, the, power, structure, involved, in, generating, these, problems, and, found, a, very, receptive, audience, among, the, rising, american, counterculture, and, political, activists, a, third, related, work, was, economics, and, the, public, purpose, 1973, in, which, he, expanded, on, these, themes, by, discussing, among, other, issues, the, subservient, role, of, women, in, the, unrewarded, management, of, ever, greater, consumption, and, the, role, of, the, technostructure, in, the, large, firm, in, influencing, perceptions, of, sound, economic, policy, aims, in, a, short, history, of, financial, euphoria, 1990, he, traces, speculative, bubbles, through, several, centuries, and, argues, that, they, are, inherent, in, the, free, market, system, because, of, mass, psychology, and, the, vested, interest, in, error, that, accompanies, speculative, euphoria, also, financial, memory, is, notoriously, short, what, currently, seems, to, be, a, new, financial, instrument, is, inevitably, nothing, of, the, sort, galbraith, cautions, the, world, of, finance, hails, the, invention, of, the, wheel, over, and, over, again, often, in, a, slightly, more, unstable, version, crucial, to, his, analysis, is, the, assertion, that, the, common, factor, in, boom, and, bust, is, the, creation, of, debt, to, finance, speculation, which, becomes, dangerously, out, of, scale, in, relation, to, the, underlying, means, of, payment, galbraith, s, main, ideas, focused, around, the, influence, of, the, market, power, of, large, corporations, he, believed, that, this, market, power, weakened, the, widely, accepted, principle, of, consumer, sovereignty, allowing, corporations, to, be, price, makers, rather, than, price, takers, allowing, corporations, with, the, strongest, market, power, to, increase, the, production, of, their, goods, beyond, an, efficient, amount, he, further, believed, that, market, power, played, a, major, role, in, inflation, he, argued, that, corporations, and, trade, unions, could, only, increase, prices, to, the, extent, that, their, market, power, allowed, he, argued, that, in, situations, of, excessive, market, power, price, controls, effectively, controlled, inflation, but, cautioned, against, using, them, in, markets, that, were, basically, efficient, such, as, agricultural, goods, and, housing, he, noted, that, price, controls, were, much, easier, to, enforce, in, industries, with, relatively, few, buyers, and, sellers, 244, galbraith, s, view, of, market, power, was, not, entirely, negative, he, also, noted, that, the, power, of, us, firms, played, a, part, in, the, success, of, the, us, economy, in, the, affluent, society, galbraith, asserts, that, classical, economic, theory, was, true, for, the, eras, before, the, present, which, were, times, of, poverty, now, however, we, have, moved, from, an, age, of, poverty, to, an, age, of, affluence, and, for, such, an, age, a, completely, new, economic, theory, is, needed, galbraith, s, main, argument, is, that, as, society, becomes, relatively, more, affluent, private, business, must, create, consumer, demand, through, advertising, and, while, this, generates, artificial, affluence, through, the, production, of, commercial, goods, and, services, the, public, sector, becomes, neglected, he, points, out, that, while, many, americans, were, able, to, purchase, luxury, items, their, parks, were, polluted, and, their, children, attended, poorly, maintained, schools, he, argues, that, markets, alone, will, under, provide, or, fail, to, provide, at, all, for, many, public, goods, whereas, private, goods, are, typically, over, provided, due, to, the, process, of, advertising, creating, an, artificial, demand, above, the, individual, s, basic, needs, this, emphasis, on, the, power, of, advertising, and, consequent, over, consumption, may, have, anticipated, the, drop, in, savings, rates, in, the, us, and, elsewhere, in, the, developing, world, galbraith, proposed, curbing, the, consumption, of, certain, products, through, greater, use, of, pigovian, taxes, and, land, value, taxes, arguing, that, this, could, be, more, efficient, than, other, forms, of, taxation, such, as, labor, taxes, galbraith, s, major, proposal, was, a, program, he, called, investment, in, men, a, large, scale, publicly, funded, education, program, aimed, at, empowering, ordinary, citizens, an, international, symposium, to, honor, john, kenneth, galbraith, sponsored, by, the, l, universit, du, littoral, c, te, d, opale, dunkerque, and, the, institut, de, gestion, sociale, paris, france, was, held, in, september, 2004, in, paris, a, special, issue, commemorating, john, kenneth, galbraith, s, centenary, of, the, review, of, political, economy, was, dedicated, in, 2008, to, galbraith, s, contribution, to, economics, three, days, before, his, death, galbraith, urged, his, son, economist, james, k, galbraith, to, write, a, short, book, on, corporate, predation, the, younger, galbraith, completed, the, predator, state, in, 2008, galbraith, s, work, in, general, and, the, affluent, society, in, particular, have, drawn, sharp, criticism, from, laissez, faire, supporters, since, the, time, of, their, publications, nobel, prize, winning, economist, milton, friedman, in, friedman, on, galbraith, and, on, curing, the, british, disease, views, galbraith, as, a, 20th, century, version, of, the, early, 19th, century, tory, radical, of, great, britain, he, argues, that, galbraith, believes, in, the, superiority, of, aristocracy, and, in, its, paternalistic, authority, that, consumers, should, not, be, allowed, choice, and, that, all, should, be, determined, by, those, with, higher, minds, commenting, many, reformers, galbraith, is, not, alone, in, this, have, as, their, basic, objection, to, a, free, market, that, it, frustrates, them, in, achieving, their, reforms, because, it, enables, people, to, have, what, they, want, not, what, the, reformers, want, hence, every, reformer, has, a, strong, tendency, to, be, averse, to, a, free, market, nobel, prize, winning, economist, robert, solow, in, a, review, of, the, new, industrial, state, points, at, galbraith, s, lack, of, empiricism, and, selectiveness, in, his, use, of, evidence, he, points, out, that, it, may, be, unjust, and, pointless, to, consider, the, degree, of, literal, truth, of, each, of, the, assertions, that, make, up, this, argument, one, would, hardly, discuss, gulliver, s, travels, by, debating, whether, there, really, are, any, little, people, or, criticize, the, grande, jatte, because, objects, aren, t, made, up, of, tiny, dots, nevertheless, it, may, help, to, judge, the, truth, of, galbraith, s, richard, parker, in, his, biography, john, kenneth, galbraith, his, life, his, economics, his, politics, characterizes, galbraith, as, a, more, complex, thinker, galbraith, s, primary, purpose, in, capitalism, the, concept, of, countervailing, power, 1952, was, ironically, to, show, that, big, business, was, now, necessary, to, the, american, economy, to, maintain, the, technological, progress, that, drives, economic, growth, galbraith, knew, that, the, countervailing, power, which, included, government, regulation, and, collective, bargaining, was, necessary, to, balanced, and, efficient, markets, in, the, new, industrial, state, 1967, galbraith, argued, that, the, dominant, american, corporations, had, created, a, technostructure, that, closely, controlled, both, consumer, demand, and, market, growth, through, advertising, and, marketing, while, galbraith, defended, government, intervention, parker, notes, that, he, also, believed, that, government, and, big, business, worked, together, to, maintain, stability, paul, krugman, downplayed, galbraith, s, stature, as, an, academic, economist, in, 1994, in, peddling, prosperity, he, places, galbraith, as, one, among, many, policy, entrepreneurs, either, economists, or, think, tank, writers, left, and, right, who, write, solely, for, the, public, as, opposed, to, those, who, write, for, other, academics, and, who, are, therefore, liable, to, make, unwarranted, diagnoses, and, offer, over, simplistic, answers, to, complex, economic, problems, krugman, asserts, that, galbraith, was, never, taken, seriously, by, fellow, academics, who, instead, viewed, him, as, more, of, a, media, personality, for, example, krugman, believes, that, galbraith, s, work, the, new, industrial, state, is, not, considered, to, be, real, economic, theory, and, that, economics, in, perspective, is, remarkably, ill, informed, thomas, sowell, in, his, 1995, book, the, vision, of, the, anointed, criticized, galbraith, s, claims, in,
