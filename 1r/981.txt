abu, hanifa, arabic, romanized, ab, an, fa, september, 699, 767, was, a, sunni, muslim, scholar, jurist, theologian, ascetic, and, eponym, of, the, hanafi, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, which, remains, the, most, widely, practiced, to, this, day, his, school, predominates, in, central, asia, afghanistan, iran, until, the, sixteenth, century, turkey, the, balkans, russia, circassia, pakistan, bangladesh, india, and, some, parts, of, the, arab, world, born, to, a, muslim, family, in, kufa, abu, hanifa, traveled, to, the, hejaz, region, of, arabia, in, his, youth, where, he, studied, in, the, islamic, holy, cities, of, mecca, and, medina, he, was, named, by, al, dhahabi, as, one, of, the, geniuses, of, the, sons, of, adam, who, combined, jurisprudence, worship, scrupulousness, and, generosity, as, his, career, as, a, jurist, and, theologian, progressed, he, became, known, for, favoring, the, use, of, reason, in, his, jurisprudential, rulings, and, even, in, his, theology, his, school, grew, after, his, death, and, the, majority, of, its, followers, would, also, come, to, follow, the, maturidi, school, of, theology, he, left, behind, two, major, students, abu, yusuf, and, muhammad, al, shaybani, who, would, later, become, celebrated, jurists, in, their, own, right, how, abu, hanifa, earned, his, name, is, disputed, according, to, some, linguists, including, muhyi, al, din, an, fa, refers, to, inkpot, in, abu, hanifa, s, dialect, he, was, often, seen, with, one, thus, earning, his, name, this, way, according, to, this, interpretation, his, name, literally, means, the, father, of, the, inkpot, however, some, historians, contest, he, earned, it, as, he, had, a, daughter, named, hanifa, his, name, would, then, mean, the, father, of, hanifa, the, opposing, side, believes, he, never, had, a, daughter, with, such, name, historians, generally, agree, abu, hanifa, was, born, in, kufa, during, the, period, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, but, they, differ, regarding, the, year, 699, ce, 80, ah, 696, ce, 77, ah, 689, ce, 70, ah, or, 680, ce, 61, ah, many, historians, choose, the, latest, date, 699, ce, 80, ah, however, muhammad, zahid, al, kawthari, adjunct, to, the, office, of, the, last, elder, of, islam, of, the, ottoman, empire, believed, the, date, of, 689, ce, 70, ah, is, supported, by, two, considerations, first, muhammad, ibn, makhlad, al, attar, considered, the, narration, of, abu, hanifa, s, son, hammad, from, malik, ibn, anas, to, be, an, example, of, an, older, man, s, narration, rather, than, a, younger, man, second, abu, hanifa, was, concerned, with, who, should, succeed, ibrahim, al, nakha, i, after, his, death, in, 96, ah, this, concern, would, have, only, arisen, if, he, was, older, than, 19, since, it, is, considered, he, only, took, his, religious, studies, seriously, after, then, if, abu, hanifa, was, born, in, 80, ah, abu, hanifa, would, have, been, 16, at, the, time, of, al, nakhai, s, death, abu, hanifa, is, thought, to, be, of, persian, ancestry, however, he, has, also, been, stated, to, have, descended, from, the, zutt, jats, who, migrated, into, iraq, during, the, islamic, golden, age, his, grandfather, zuta, may, have, been, captured, by, muslim, troops, in, kabul, and, sold, as, a, slave, in, kufa, where, he, was, purchased, and, freed, by, an, arab, tribesman, of, the, taym, allah, a, branch, of, the, banu, bakr, zuta, and, his, progeny, thereafter, would, have, become, clients, of, the, taym, allah, hence, the, sporadic, references, to, abu, hanifa, as, al, taymi, according, to, his, grandson, isma, il, however, his, lineage, went, back, to, free, persians, who, had, never, been, held, as, slaves, he, called, abu, hanifa, s, great, grandfather, marzuban, which, is, an, arabicized, form, of, the, sasanian, military, office, of, marzban, held, by, governors, of, the, frontier, provinces, of, the, sasanian, realm, there, is, scant, biographical, information, about, abu, hanifa, it, is, generally, known, that, he, worked, a, producer, and, seller, of, khazz, a, type, of, silk, clothing, material, he, attended, lectures, on, jurisprudence, conducted, by, the, kufan, scholar, hammad, ibn, abi, sulayman, d, 737, he, also, possibly, learnt, jurisprudence, fiqh, from, the, meccan, scholar, ata, ibn, abi, rabah, d, c, 733, while, on, pilgrimage, when, hammad, died, abu, hanifa, succeeded, him, as, the, principal, authority, on, islamic, law, in, kufa, and, the, chief, representative, of, the, kufan, school, of, jurisprudence, abu, hanifa, gradually, gained, influence, as, an, authority, on, legal, questions, founding, a, moderate, rationalist, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, that, was, named, after, him, in, 763, al, mansur, the, abbasid, caliph, offered, abu, hanifa, the, post, of, qadi, al, qudat, chief, judge, of, the, state, but, he, declined, the, offer, choosing, to, remain, independent, his, student, abu, yusuf, was, later, appointed, to, the, post, by, caliph, harun, al, rashid, in, his, reply, to, al, mansur, abu, hanifa, said, that, he, was, not, fit, for, the, post, al, mansur, who, had, his, own, ideas, and, reasons, for, offering, the, post, accused, abu, hanifa, of, lying, if, i, am, lying, abu, hanifa, responded, then, my, statement, is, doubly, correct, how, can, you, appoint, a, liar, to, the, exalted, post, of, a, qadi, chief, judge, incensed, by, this, reply, al, mansur, had, abu, hanifa, arrested, locked, in, prison, and, tortured, it, was, said, that, once, in, prison, he, was, never, fed, nor, cared, for, even, in, prison, the, jurist, continued, to, teach, those, who, were, permitted, to, visit, him, on, 15, rajab, 150, 15, august, 767, abu, hanifa, died, in, prison, the, cause, of, his, death, is, not, clear, as, it, was, said, by, some, that, abu, hanifa, issued, a, legal, opinion, for, bearing, arms, against, al, mansur, so, al, mansur, had, him, poisoned, his, fellow, prisoner, and, founder, of, karaite, judaism, anan, ben, david, was, said, to, have, received, life, saving, counsel, from, abu, hanifa, it, was, said, that, so, many, people, attended, his, funeral, that, the, funeral, service, was, repeated, six, times, for, the, more, than, 50, 000, people, who, had, massed, before, he, was, actually, buried, the, historian, al, khatib, said, that, for, a, full, 20, days, people, performed, funeral, prayers, for, him, many, years, later, the, abu, hanifa, mosque, was, built, in, the, adhamiyah, neighbourhood, of, baghdad, abu, hanifa, also, supported, the, cause, of, zayd, ibn, ali, and, ibrahim, al, qamar, both, alid, zaydi, imams, the, structures, of, the, tombs, of, abu, hanifa, and, abdul, qadir, gilani, were, destroyed, by, shah, ismail, of, the, safavid, empire, in, 1508, in, 1533, the, ottomans, conquered, baghdad, and, rebuilt, the, tombs, of, abu, hanifa, and, abdul, qadir, as, well, as, other, sunni, sites, the, sources, from, which, abu, hanifa, derived, islamic, law, in, order, of, importance, and, preference, were, the, qur, an, the, authentic, narrations, of, the, muslim, prophet, muhammad, known, as, hadith, consensus, of, the, muslim, community, ijma, analogical, reasoning, qiyas, juristic, discretion, istihsan, and, the, customs, of, the, local, population, enacting, muslim, laws, urf, the, development, of, analogical, reason, and, the, scope, and, boundaries, by, which, it, may, be, used, was, recognized, by, the, majority, of, muslim, jurists, but, its, establishment, as, a, legal, tool, was, the, result, of, the, hanafi, school, while, it, was, likely, used, by, some, of, his, teachers, abu, hanifa, is, regarded, by, modern, scholarship, as, the, first, to, formally, adopt, and, institute, analogical, reason, as, a, part, of, islamic, law, as, the, fourth, caliph, ali, had, transferred, the, islamic, capital, to, kufa, and, many, of, the, first, generation, of, muslims, had, settled, there, the, hanafi, school, of, law, based, many, of, its, rulings, on, the, prophetic, tradition, as, transmitted, by, those, first, generation, muslims, residing, in, iraq, thus, the, hanafi, school, came, to, be, known, as, the, kufan, or, iraqi, school, ali, and, abdullah, son, of, masud, helped, form, much, of, the, base, of, the, school, as, well, as, other, personalities, from, the, direct, relatives, or, ahli, ll, bay, of, mo, ammad, from, whom, abu, hanifa, had, studied, such, as, muhammad, al, baqir, many, jurists, and, historians, had, reportedly, lived, in, kufa, including, one, of, abu, hanifa, s, main, teachers, hammad, ibn, abi, sulayman, he, was, highly, regarded, across, the, various, fields, of, sacred, knowledge, and, significantly, influenced, the, development, of, muslim, theology, during, his, lifetime, he, was, acknowledged, as, a, jurist, of, the, highest, calibre, the, shafi, i, and, prominent, hadith, scholar, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, stated, that, criticism, of, abu, hanifa, holds, no, significance, as, figures, like, abu, hanifa, are, on, a, degree, to, which, allah, the, exalted, has, raised, them, in, that, they, are, followed, and, imitated, ibn, taymiyya, credited, abu, hanifa, for, his, knowledge, and, addressed, the, accusations, against, him, stating, there, is, no, doubt, regarding, imam, abu, hanifa, s, knowledge, people, later, attributed, many, lies, to, imam, abu, hanifa, which, were, all, untrue, the, aim, of, such, writings, was, to, taint, imam, abu, hanifa, his, students, ibn, kathir, and, al, dhahabi, held, similar, opinions, about, abu, hanifa, extensively, rebuking, accusations, against, him, and, praising, his, contributions, he, received, the, honorific, title, al, imam, al, a, zam, the, highly, venerated, im, m, and, his, tomb, surmounted, by, a, dome, erected, by, admirers, in, 1066, is, still, a, shrine, for, pilgrims, it, was, restored, in, 1535, by, suleiman, the, magnificent, after, the, ottoman, conquest, of, baghdad, abu, hanifa, also, had, his, critics, he, was, perceived, by, muhammad, al, bukhari, ibn, sa, d, ibn, abi, shaybah, to, be, a, heretic, and, in, opposition, to, the, instructions, of, muhammad, and, al, bukhari, s, teacher, al, humaydi, was, one, of, the, first, to, pen, a, refutation, of, his, abu, hanifa, s, thought, the, zahiri, scholar, ibn, hazm, quoted, sufyan, ibn, uyaynah, he, affairs, of, men, were, in, harmony, until, they, were, changed, by, ab, han, fa, in, k, fa, al, batti, in, basra, and, m, lik, in, medina, early, muslim, jurist, hammad, ibn, salamah, once, related, a, story, about, a, highway, robber, who, posed, as, an, old, man, to, hide, his, identity, he, then, remarked, that, were, the, robber, still, alive, he, would, be, a, follower, of, abu, hanifa, today, the, hanafi, school, is, followed, by, 45, of, muslims, and, abu, hanifa, is, popularly, known, amongst, sunni, muslims, as, a, man, of, the, highest, personal, qualities, a, performer, of, good, works, remarkable, for, his, self, denial, humble, spirit, devotion, and, pious, awe, of, god, abu, hanifa, is, regarded, by, some, authorities, as, one, of, the, tabi, un, the, generation, after, the, sahaba, who, were, the, companions, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, this, is, based, on, reports, that, he, met, at, least, four, sahaba, including, anas, ibn, malik, with, some, even, reporting, that, he, transmitted, hadith, from, him, and, other, companions, of, muhammad, others, take, the, view, that, abu, hanifa, only, saw, around, half, a, dozen, companions, possibly, at, a, young, age, and, did, not, directly, narrate, hadith, from, them, abu, hanifa, was, born, at, least, 60, years, after, the, death, of, muhammad, but, during, the, time, of, the, first, generation, of, muslims, some, of, whom, lived, on, until, abu, hanifa, s, youth, anas, ibn, malik, muhammad, s, personal, attendant, died, in, 93, ah, and, another, companion, abul, tufail, amir, bin, wathilah, died, in, 100, ah, when, abu, hanifa, was, at, least, 20, years, old, the, author, of, al, khairat, al, hisan, collected, information, from, books, of, biographies, and,

hadith, and, fiqh, with, abu, hanifa, his, most, famous, students, were, im, m, abu, yusuf, who, served, as, the, first, chief, justice, in, the, muslim, world, and, im, m, muhammad, al, shaybani, who, was, the, teacher, of, the, shafi, i, school, of, jurisprudence, founder, im, m, al, shafi, i, his, other, students, included, abdullah, ibn, mubarak, and, fudhayl, bin, iyaadh, al, nadr, ibn,

wearing, much, cologne, tall, not, speaking, except, in, reply, to, someone, else, and, not, involving, himself, in, what, did, not, concern, him, ibn, al, mubarak, remarked, he, never, saw, a, man, more, revered, in, gatherings, nor, better, in, character, and, forbearance, than, abu, hanifa, as, with, malik, ibn, anas, who, was, a, teacher, of, imam, al, shafi, i, 121, who, in, turn, was, a, teacher, of, sunni, imam, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, imam, abu, hanifa, was, a, student, of, ja, far, al, sadiq, who, was, a, descendant, of, the, islamic, nabi, prophet, muhammad, thus, all, of, the, four, great, imams, of, sunni, fiqh, are, connected, to, ja, far, from, the, bayt, household, of, muhammad, whether, directly, or, indirectly, in, one, hadith, abu, hanifa, once, said, about, imam, ja, far, i, have, not, seen, anyone, with, more, knowledge, than, ja, far, ibn, muhammad, however, in, another, hadith, abu, hanifa, said, i, met, with, zayd, ja, far, s, uncle, and, i, never, saw, in, his,

of, jahm, ibn, safwan, and, the, mushabbihah, antropomorphists, and, he, probably, said, instead, of, mushabbihah, muqatiliyyah, followers, of, muqatil, ibn, sulayman
