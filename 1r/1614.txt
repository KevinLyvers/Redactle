lorenzo, romano, amedeo, carlo, avogadro, count, of, quaregna, and, cerreto, v, d, r, o, also, us, v, italian, 9, august, 1776, 9, july, 1856, was, an, italian, scientist, most, noted, for, his, contribution, to, molecular, theory, now, known, as, avogadro, s, law, which, states, that, equal, volumes, of, gases, under, the, same, conditions, of, temperature, and, pressure, will, contain, equal, numbers, of, molecules, in, tribute, to, him, the, ratio, of, the, number, of, elementary, entities, atoms, molecules, ions, or, other, particles, in, a, substance, to, its, amount, of, substance, the, latter, having, the, unit, mole, 6, 022, 140, 76, 10, 23, mol, 1, is, known, as, the, avogadro, constant, this, constant, is, denoted, n, a, and, is, one, of, the, seven, defining, constants, of, the, si, amedeo, avogadro, was, born, in, turin, to, a, noble, family, of, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, now, part, of, italy, in, the, year, 1776, he, graduated, in, ecclesiastical, law, at, the, late, age, of, 20, and, began, to, practice, soon, after, he, dedicated, himself, to, physics, and, mathematics, then, called, positive, philosophy, and, in, 1809, started, teaching, them, at, a, liceo, high, school, in, vercelli, where, his, family, lived, and, had, some, property, in, 1811, he, published, an, article, with, the, title, essai, d, une, mani, re, de, d, terminer, les, masses, relatives, des, mol, cules, l, mentaires, des, corps, et, les, proportions, selon, lesquelles, elles, entrent, dans, ces, combinaisons, essay, on, a, manner, of, determining, the, relative, masses, of, the, elementary, molecules, of, bodies, and, the, proportions, by, which, they, enter, these, combinations, which, contains, avogadro, s, hypothesis, avogadro, submitted, this, essay, to, jean, claude, delam, therie, s, journal, de, physique, de, chimie, et, d, histoire, naturelle, journal, of, physics, chemistry, and, natural, history, in, 1820, he, became, a, professor, of, physics, at, the, university, of, turin, turin, was, now, the, capital, of, the, restored, savoyard, kingdom, of, sardinia, under, victor, emmanuel, i, avogadro, was, active, in, the, revolutionary, movement, of, march, 1821, as, a, result, he, lost, his, chair, in, 1823, or, as, the, university, officially, declared, it, was, very, glad, to, allow, this, interesting, scientist, to, take, a, rest, from, heavy, teaching, duties, in, order, to, be, able, to, give, better, attention, to, his, researches, eventually, king, charles, albert, granted, a, constitution, statuto, albertino, in, 1848, well, before, this, avogadro, had, been, recalled, to, the, university, in, turin, in, 1833, where, he, taught, for, another, twenty, years, little, is, known, about, avogadro, s, private, life, which, appears, to, have, been, sober, and, religious, he, married, felicita, mazz, and, had, six, children, avogadro, held, posts, dealing, with, statistics, meteorology, and, weights, and, measures, he, introduced, the, metric, system, into, piedmont, and, was, a, member, of, the, royal, superior, council, on, public, instruction, he, died, on, 9, july, 1856, in, honour, of, avogadro, s, contributions, to, molecular, theory, the, number, of, molecules, per, mole, of, a, substance, is, named, the, avogadro, constant, n, a, it, is, exactly, 6, 022, 140, 76, 10, 23, mol, 1, the, avogadro, constant, is, used, to, compute, the, results, of, chemical, reactions, it, allows, chemists, to, determine, the, amounts, of, substances, produced, in, a, given, reaction, to, a, great, degree, of, accuracy, johann, josef, loschmidt, first, calculated, the, value, of, the, avogadro, constant, the, number, of, particles, in, one, mole, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, loschmidt, number, in, german, speaking, countries, loschmidt, constant, now, has, another, meaning, avogadro, s, law, states, that, the, relationship, between, the, masses, of, the, same, volume, of, all, gases, at, the, same, temperature, and, pressure, corresponds, to, the, relationship, between, their, respective, molecular, weights, hence, the, relative, molecular, mass, of, a, gas, can, be, calculated, from, the, mass, of, a, sample, of, known, volume, avogadro, developed, this, hypothesis, after, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, published, his, law, on, volumes, and, combining, gases, in, 1808, the, greatest, problem, avogadro, had, to, resolve, was, the, confusion, at, that, time, regarding, atoms, and, molecules, one, of, his, most, important, contributions, was, clearly, distinguishing, one, from, the, other, stating, that, gases, are, composed, of, molecules, and, these, molecules, are, composed, of, atoms, for, instance, john, dalton, did, not, consider, this, possibility, avogadro, did, not, actually, use, the, word, atom, as, the, words, atom, and, molecule, were, used, almost, without, difference, he, believed, that, there, were, three, kinds, of, molecules, including, an, elementary, molecule, our, atom, also, he, gave, more, attention, to, the, definition, of, mass, as, distinguished, from, weight, in, 1815, he, published, m, moire, sur, les, masses, relatives, des, mol, cules, des, corps, simples, ou, densit, s, pr, sum, es, de, leur, gaz, et, sur, la, constitution, de, quelques, uns, de, leur, compos, s, pour, servir, de, suite, l, essai, sur, le, m, me, sujet, publi, dans, le, journal, de, physique, juillet, 1811, note, on, the, relative, masses, of, elementary, molecules, or, suggested, densities, of, their, gases, and, on, the, constituents, of, some, of, their, compounds, as, a, follow, up, to, the, essay, on, the, same, subject, published, in, the, journal, of, physics, july, 1811, about, gas, densities, in, 1821, he, published, another, paper, nouvelles, consid, rations, sur, la, th, orie, des, proportions, d, termin, es, dans, les, combinaisons, et, sur, la, d, termination, des, masses, des, mol, cules, des, corps, new, considerations, on, the, theory, of, proportions, determined, in, combinations, and, on, determination, of, the, masses, of, atoms, and, shortly, afterwards, m, moire, sur, la, mani, re, de, ramener, les, compos, s, organiques, aux, lois, ordinaires, des, proportions, d, termin, es, note, on, the, manner, of, finding, the, organic, composition, by, the, ordinary, laws, of, determined, proportions, in, 1841, he, published, his, work, in, fisica, dei, corpi, ponderabili, ossia, trattato, della, costituzione, materiale, de, corpi, 4, volumes, the, scientific, community, did, not, give, great, attention, to, avogadro, s, theory, and, it, was, not, immediately, accepted, andr, marie, amp, re, proposed, a, very, similar, theory, three, years, later, in, his, sur, la, d, termination, des, proportions, dans, lesquelles, les, corps, se, combinent, d, apr, s, le, nombre, et, la, disposition, respective, des, mol, cules, dont, leurs, particules, int, grantes, sont, compos, es, on, the, determination, of, proportions, in, which, bodies, combine, according, to, the, number, and, the, respective, disposition, of, the, molecules, by, which, their, integral, particles, are, made, but, the, same, indifference, was, shown, to, his, theory, as, well, only, through, studies, by, charles, fr, d, ric, gerhardt, and, auguste, laurent, on, organic, chemistry, was, it, possible, to, demonstrate, that, avogadro, s, law, explained, why, the, same, quantities, of, molecules, in, a, gas, have, the, same, volume, unfortunately, related, experiments, with, some, inorganic, substances, showed, seeming, contradictions, this, was, finally, resolved, by, stanislao, cannizzaro, as, announced, at, karlsruhe, congress, in, 1860, four, years, after, avogadro, s, death, he, explained, that, these, exceptions, were, due, to, molecular, dissociations, at, certain, temperatures, and, that, avogadro, s, law, determined, not, only, molecular, masses, but, atomic, masses, as, well, in, 1911, a, meeting, in, turin, commemorated, the, hundredth, anniversary, of, the, publication, of, avogadro, s, classic, 1811, paper, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, attended, and, avogadro, s, great, contribution, to, chemistry, was, recognized, rudolf, clausius, with, his, kinetic, theory, on, gases, proposed, in, 1857, provided, further, evidence, for, avogadro, s, law, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, showed, that, avogadro, s, theory, also, held, in, dilute, solutions, avogadro, is, hailed, as, a, founder, of, the, atomic, molecular, theory
