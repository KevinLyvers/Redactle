party, these, positions, have, led, some, to, criticize, strauss, for, his, seeming, collaboration, with, the, nazis, however, strauss, s, daughter, in, law, alice, grab, strauss, was, jewish, and, much, of, his, apparent, acquiescence, to, the, nazi, party, was, done, to, save, her, life, and, the, lives, of, her, children, his, jewish, grandchildren, he, was, also, apolitical, and, took, the, reichsmusikkammer, post, to, advance, copyright, protections, for, composers, attempting, as, well, to, preserve, performances, of, works, by, banned, composers, such, as, mahler, and, felix, mendelssohn, further, strauss, insisted, on, using, a, jewish, librettist, stefan, zweig, for, his, opera, die, schweigsame, frau, which, ultimately, led, to, his, firing, from, the, reichsmusikkammer, and, bayreuth, his, opera, friedenstag, which, premiered, just, before, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, was, a, thinly, veiled, criticism, of, the, nazi, party, that, attempted, to, persuade, germans, to, abandon, violence, for, peace, thanks, to, his, influence, his, daughter, in, law, was, placed, under, protected, house, arrest, during, the, war, but, despite, extensive, efforts, he, was, unable, to, save, dozens, of, his, in, laws, from, being, killed, in, nazi, concentration, camps, in, 1948, a, year, before, his, death, he, was, cleared, of, any, wrongdoing, by, a,

his, musical, studies, at, the, age, of, four, studying, piano, with, august, tombo, who, was, the, harpist, in, the, munich, court, orchestra, soon, after, he, began, attending, the, rehearsals, of, the, orchestra, and, began, getting, lessons, in, music, theory, and, orchestration, from, the, ensemble, s, assistant, conductor, he, wrote, his, first, composition, at, the, age, of, six, and, continued, to, write, music, almost, until, his, death, in, 1872, he, started, receiving, violin, instruction, from, benno, walter, the, director, of, the, munich, court, orchestra, and, his, father, s, cousin, and, at, 11, began, five, years, of, compositional, study, with, friedrich, wilhelm, meyer, in, 1882, he, graduated, from, the, ludwigsgymnasium, and, afterwards, attended, only, one, year, at, the, university, of, munich, in, 1882, 1883, in, addition, to, his, formal, teachers, strauss, was, profoundly, influenced, musically, by, his, father, who, made, instrumental, music, making, central, to, the, strauss, home, the, strauss, family, was, frequently, joined, in, their, home, for, music, making, meals, and, other, activities, by, the, orphaned, composer, and, music, theorist, ludwig, thuille, who, was, viewed, as, an, adopted, member, of, the, family, strauss, s, father, taught, his, son, the, music, of, beethoven, haydn, mozart, and, schubert, his, father, further, assisted, his, son, with, his, musical, composition, during, the, 1870s, and, into, the, early, 1880s, providing, advice, comments, and, criticisms, his, father, also, provided, support, by, showcasing, his, son, s, compositions, in, performance, with, the, wilde, gung, l, an, amateur, orchestra, he, conducted, from, 1875, to, 1896, many, of, his, early, symphonic, compositions, were, written, for, this, ensemble, his, compositions, at, this, time, were, indebted, to, the, style, of, robert, schumann, and, felix, mendelssohn, true, to, his, father, s, teachings, his, father, undoubtedly, had, a, crucial, influence, on, his, son, s, developing, taste, not, least, in, strauss, s, abiding, love, for, the, horn, his, horn, concerto, no, 1, is, representative, of, this, period, and, is, a, staple, of, the, modern, horn, repertoire, in, 1874, strauss, heard, his, first, wagner, operas, lohengrin, and, tannh, user, in, 1878, he, attended, performances, of, die, walk, re, and, siegfried, in, munich, and, in, 1879, he, attended, performances, of, the, entire, ring, cycle, die, meistersinger, von, n, rnberg, and, tristan, und, isolde, the, influence, of, wagner, s, music, on, strauss, s, style, was, to, be, profound, but, at, first, his, musically, conservative, father, forbade, him, to, study, it, indeed, in, the, strauss, household, the, music, of, richard, wagner, was, viewed, with, deep, suspicion, and, it, was, not, until, the, age, of, 16, that, strauss, was, able, to, obtain, a, score, of, tristan, und, isolde, in, 1882, he, went, to, the, bayreuth, festival, to, hear, his, father, perform, in, the, world, premiere, of, wagner, s, parsifal, after, which, surviving, letters, to, his, father, and, to, thuille, detail, his, seemingly, negative, impression, of, wagner, and, his, music, in, later, life, strauss, said, that, he, deeply, regretted, the, conservative, hostility, to, wagner, s, progressive, works, in, early, 1882, in, vienna, strauss, gave, the, first, performance, of, his, violin, concerto, in, d, minor, playing, a, piano, reduction, of, the, orchestral, part, himself, with, his, teacher, benno, walter, as, soloist, the, same, year, he, entered, ludwig, maximilian, university, of, munich, where, he, studied, philosophy, and, art, history, but, not, music, he, left, a, year, later, to, go, to, berlin, where, he, studied, briefly, before, securing, a, post, with, the, meiningen, court, orchestra, as, assistant, conductor, to, hans, von, b, low, who, had, been, enormously, impressed, by, the, young, composer, s, serenade, op, 7, for, wind, instruments, composed, when, he, was, only, 16, years, of, age, strauss, learned, the, art, of, conducting, by, observing, b, low, in, rehearsal, b, low, was, very, fond, of, the, young, man, and, strauss, considered, him, as, his, greatest, conducting, mentor, often, crediting, him, as, teaching, him, the, art, of, interpretation, notably, under, b, low, s, baton, he, made, his, first, major, appearance, as, a, concert, pianist, performing, mozart, s, piano, concerto, no, 24, for, which, he, composed, his, own, cadenzas, in, december, 1885, b, low, unexpectedly, resigned, from, his, post, and, strauss, was, left, to, lead, the, meiningen, court, orchestra, as, interim, principal, conductor, for, the, remainder, of, the, artistic, season, through, april, 1886, he, notably, helped, prepare, the, orchestra, for, the, world, premiere, performance, of, johannes, brahms, s, symphony, no, 4, which, brahms, himself, conducted, he, also, conducted, his, symphony, no, 2, for, brahms, who, advised, strauss, your, symphony, contains, too, much, playing, about, with, themes, this, piling, up, of, many, themes, based, on, a, triad, which, differ, from, one, another, only, in, rhythm, has, no, value, brahms, music, like, wagner, s, also, left, a, tremendous, impression, upon, strauss, and, he, often, referred, to, this, time, of, his, life, as, his, brahmsschw, rmerei, brahms, adoration, during, which, several, his, compositions, clearly, show, brahms, influence, including, the, piano, quartet, in, c, minor, op, 13, 1883, 84, wandrers, sturmlied, 1884, and, burleske, 1885, 86, in, 1885, strauss, met, the, composer, alexander, ritter, who, was, a, violinist, in, the, meiningen, orchestra, and, the, husband, of, one, of, richard, wagner, s, nieces, an, avid, champion, of, the, ideals, of, wagner, and, franz, liszt, ritter, had, a, tremendous, impact, on, the, trajectory, of, strauss, s, work, as, a, composer, from, 1885, onward, ritter, convinced, strauss, to, abandon, his, more, conservative, style, of, composing, and, embrace, the, music, of, the, future, by, modeling, his, compositional, style, on, wagner, and, liszt, he, further, influenced, strauss, by, engaging, him, in, studies, and, conversations, on, the, writings, of, arthur, schopenhauer, wagner, and, friedrich, von, hausegger, all, of, this, together, gave, a, new, aesthetic, anchor, to, strauss, which, first, became, evident, in, his, embrace, of, the, tone, poem, genre, after, leaving, his, post, in, meiningen, in, 1886, strauss, spent, several, weeks, traveling, throughout, italy, before, assuming, a, new, post, as, third, conductor, at, the, bavarian, state, opera, then, known, as, the, munich, hofoper, while, traveling, he, wrote, down, descriptions, of, the, various, sites, he, was, seeing, along, with, tonal, impressions, that, went, with, those, descriptions, these, he, communicated, in, a, letter, to, his, mother, and, they, ultimately, were, used, as, the, beginning, of, his, first, tone, poem, aus, italien, 1886, shortly, after, strauss, assumed, his, opera, conducting, duties, in, munich, ritter, himself, moved, to, the, city, in, september, 1886, for, the, next, three, years, the, two, men, would, meet, regularly, often, joined, by, thuille, and, anton, seidl, to, discuss, music, particularly, wagner, and, liszt, and, discuss, poetry, literature, and, philosophy, strauss, s, tenure, at, the, bavarian, state, opera, was, not, a, happy, one, with, the, death, of, ludwig, ii, of, bavaria, in, june, 1886, the, opera, house, was, not, as, well, financially, supported, by, his, successor, otto, of, bavaria, which, meant, that, much, of, the, more, ambitious, and, expensive, repertoire, that, he, wanted, to, stage, such, as, wagner, s, operas, were, unfeasible, the, opera, assignments, he, was, given, works, by, boieldieu, auber, and, donizetti, bored, him, and, to, make, matters, worse, hermann, levi, the, senior, conductor, at, the, house, was, often, ill, and, strauss, was, required, to, step, in, at, the, last, minute, to, conduct, performance, for, operas, which, he, had, never, rehearsed, this, caused, problems, for, him, the, singers, and, the, orchestra, during, this, time, strauss, did, find, much, more, enjoyable, conducting, work, outside, munich, in, berlin, dresden, and, leipzig, in, the, latter, city, he, met, and, befriended, the, composer, gustav, mahler, in, the, autumn, of, 1887, also, happily, strauss, met, his, future, wife, soprano, pauline, de, ahna, in, 1887, de, ahna, was, then, a, voice, student, at, the, munich, musikschule, now, the, university, of, music, and, performing, arts, munich, but, soon, switched, to, private, lessons, with, strauss, who, became, her, principal, teacher, in, may, 1889, strauss, left, his, post, with, the, bavarian, state, opera, after, being, appointed, kapellmeister, to, charles, alexander, grand, duke, of, saxe, weimar, eisenach, in, weimar, beginning, in, the, autumn, of, 1889, during, the, summer, of, 1889, he, served, as, the, assistant, conductor, of, the, bayreuth, festival, during, which, time, he, befriended, cosima, wagner, who, became, a, longterm, close, friend, pauline, de, ahna, went, with, strauss, to, weimar, and, he, later, married, her, on, 10, september, 1894, she, was, famous, for, being, irascible, garrulous, eccentric, and, outspoken, but, to, all, appearances, the, marriage, was, essentially, happy, and, she, was, a, great, source, of, inspiration, to, him, throughout, his, life, from, his, earliest, songs, to, the, final, four, last, songs, of, 1948, he, preferred, the, soprano, voice, to, all, others, and, all, his, operas, contain, important, soprano, roles, in, weimar, she, created, the, role, of, freihild, in, strauss, s, first, opera, guntram, in, 1894, the, opera, was, received, with, mixed, reviews, in, weimar, but, its, later, production, in, munich, was, met, with, scorn, and, was, strauss, s, first, major, failure, in, spite, of, the, failure, of, his, first, opera, strauss, s, tenure, in, weimar, brought, about, several, important, successes, for, his, career, his, tone, poem, don, juan, premiered, in, weimar, on, 11, november, 1889, to, tremendous, critical, response, and, the, work, quickly, brought, him, international, fame, and, success, this, was, followed, by, another, lauded, achievement, the, premiere, of, his, tone, poem, death, and, transfiguration, in, 1890, both, of, these, works, along, with, the, earlier, burleske, became, internationally, known, and, established, him, as, a, leading, modernist, composer, he, also, had, much, success, as, a, conductor, in, weimar, particularly, with, the, symphonic, poems, of, liszt, and, an, uncut, production, of, tristan, und, isolde, in, 1892, in, the, summer, of, 1894, strauss, made, his, conducting, debut, at, the, bayreuth, festival, conducting, wagner, s, tannh,

sign, the, manifesto, of, german, artists, and, intellectuals, supporting, the, german, role, in, the, conflict, several, colleagues, including, max, reinhardt, signed, but, strauss, refused, and, his, response, was, recorded, with, approval, by, the, french, critic, romain, rolland, in, his, diary, for, october, 1914, declarations, about, war, and, politics, are, not, fitting, for, an, artist,

the, nazi, party, and, studiously, avoided, nazi, forms, of, greeting, for, reasons, of, expediency, however, he, was, initially, drawn, into, cooperating, with, the, early, nazi, regime, in, the, hope, that, hitler, an, ardent, wagnerian, and, music, lover, who, had, admired, strauss, s, work, since, viewing, salome, in, 1907, would, promote, german, art, and, culture, strauss, s, need, to, protect, his, jewish, daughter, in, law, and, jewish, grandchildren, also, motivated, his, behavior, in, addition, to, his, determination, to, preserve, and, conduct, the, music, of, banned, composers, such, as, gustav, mahler, and, claude, debussy, in, 1933, strauss, wrote, in, his, private, notebook, i, consider, the, streicher, goebbels, jew, baiting, as, a, disgrace, to, german, honour, as, evidence, of, incompetence, the, basest, weapon, of, untalented, lazy, mediocrity, against, a, higher, intelligence, and, greater, talent, meanwhile, far, from, being, an, admirer, of, strauss, s, work, joseph, goebbels, maintained, expedient, cordiality, with, strauss, only, for, a, period, goebbels, wrote, in, his, diary, unfortunately, we, still, need, him, but, one, day, we, shall, have, our, own, music, and, then, we, shall, have, no, further, need, of, this, decadent, neurotic, nevertheless, because, of, strauss, s, international, eminence, in, november, 1933, he, was, appointed, to, the, post, of, president, of, the, newly, founded, reichsmusikkammer, the, reich, music, chamber, strauss, who, had, lived, through, numerous, political, regimes, and, had, no, interest, in, politics, decided, to, accept, the, position, but, to, remain, apolitical, a, decision, which, would, eventually, become, untenable, he, wrote, to, his, family, i, made, music, under, the, kaiser, and, under, ebert, i, ll, survive, under, this, one, as, well, he, later, wrote, in, his, journal, in, november, 1933, the, minister, goebbels, nominated, me, president, of, the, reichsmusikkammer, without, obtaining, my, prior, agreement, i, was, not, consulted, i, accepted, this, honorary, office, because, i, hoped, that, i, would, be, able, to, do, some, good, and, prevent, worse, misfortunes, if, from, now, onwards, german, musical, life, were, going, to, be, as, it, was, said, reorganized, by, amateurs, and, ignorant, place, seekers, strauss, privately, scorned, goebbels, and, called, him, a, pipsqueak, however, in, 1933, he, dedicated, an, orchestral, song, das, b, chlein, the, little, brook, to, goebbels, to, gain, his, cooperation, in, extending, german, music, copyright, laws, from, 30, years, to, 50, years, also, in, 1933, he, replaced, arturo, toscanini, as, director, of, the, bayreuth, festival, after, toscanini, had, resigned, in, protest, against, the, nazi, regime, strauss, attempted, to, ignore, nazi, bans, on, performances, of, works, by, debussy, mahler, and, mendelssohn, he, also, continued, to, work, on, a, comic, opera, die, schweigsame, frau, with, his, jewish, friend, and, librettist, stefan, zweig, when, the, opera, was, premiered, in, dresden, in, 1935, strauss, insisted, that, zweig, s, name, appear, on, the, theatrical, billing, much, to, the, ire, of, the, nazi, regime, hitler, and, goebbels, avoided, attending, the, opera, and, it, was, halted, after, three, performances, and, subsequently, banned, by, the, third, reich, on, 17, june, 1935, strauss, wrote, a, letter, to, stefan, zweig, in, which, he, stated, do, you, believe, i, am, ever, in, any, of, my, actions, guided, by, the, thought, that, i, am, german, do, you, suppose, mozart, was, consciously, aryan, when, he, composed, i, recognise, only, two, types, of, people, those, who, have, talent, and, those, who, have, none, this, letter, to, zweig, was, intercepted, by, the, gestapo, and, sent, to, hitler, strauss, was, subsequently, dismissed, from, his, post, as, reichsmusikkammer, president, in, 1935, the, 1936, berlin, summer, olympics, nevertheless, used, strauss, s, olympische, hymne, which, he, had, composed, in, 1934, strauss, s, seeming, relationship, with, the, nazis, in, the, 1930s, attracted, criticism, from, some, noted, musicians, including, toscanini, who, in, 1933, had, said, to, strauss, the, composer, i, take, off, my, hat, to, strauss, the, man, i, put, it, back, on, again, when, strauss, had, accepted, the, presidency, of, the, reichsmusikkammer, much, of, strauss, s, motivation, in, his, conduct, during, the, third, reich, was, however, to, protect, his, jewish, daughter, in, law, alice, and, his, jewish, grandchildren, from, persecution, both, of, his, grandsons, were, bullied, at, school, but, strauss, used, his, considerable, influence, to, prevent, the, boys, or, their, mother, being, sent, to, concentration, camps, frustrated, that, he, could, no, longer, work, with, zweig, as, his, librettist, strauss, turned, to, joseph, gregor, a, viennese, theatre, historian, at, gregor, s, request, the, first, opera, they, worked, on, together, was, daphne, but, it, ultimately, became, the, second, of, their, operas, to, be, premiered, their, first, work, to, be, staged, was, in, 1938, when, the, entire, nation, was, preparing, for, war, they, presented, friedenstag, peace, day, a, one, act, opera, set, in, a, besieged, fortress, during, the, thirty, years, war, the, work, is, essentially, a, hymn, to, peace, and, a, thinly, veiled, criticism, of, the, third, reich, with, its, contrasts, between, freedom, and, enslavement, war, and, peace, light, and, dark, this, work, has, a, close, affinity, with, beethoven, s, fidelio, productions, of, the, opera, ceased, shortly, after, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1939, the, two, men, collaborated, on, two, more, operas, which, proved, to, be, strauss, s, last, die, liebe, der, danae, 1940, and, capriccio, 1942, when, his, jewish, daughter, in, law, alice, was, placed, under, house, arrest, in, garmisch, partenkirchen, in, 1938, strauss, used, his, connections, in, berlin, including, opera, house, general, intendant, heinz, tietjen, to, secure, her, safety, he, drove, to, the, theresienstadt, concentration, camp, to, argue, albeit, unsuccessfully, for, the, release, of, alice, s, grandmother, paula, neumann, in, the, end, neumann, and, 25, other, relatives, were, murdered, in, the, camps, while, alice, s, mother, marie, von, grab, was, safe, in, lucerne, switzerland, strauss, also, wrote, several, letters, to, the, ss, pleading, for, the, release, of, her, children, who, were, also, held, in, camps, his, letters, were, ignored, in, 1942, strauss, moved, with, his, family, back, to, vienna, where, alice, and, her, children, could, be, protected, by, baldur, von, schirach, the, gauleiter, of, vienna, however, strauss, was, unable, to, protect, his, jewish, relatives, completely, in, early, 1944, while, strauss, was, away, alice, and, her, son, franz, were, abducted, by, the, gestapo, and, imprisoned, for, two, nights, strauss, s, personal, intervention, at, this, point, saved, them, and, he, was, able, to, take, them, back, to, garmisch, where, the, two, remained, under, house, arrest, until, the, end, of, the, war, strauss, completed, the, composition, of, metamorphosen, a, work, for, 23, solo, strings, in, 1945, the, title, and, inspiration, for, the, work, comes, from, a, profoundly, self, examining, poem, by, goethe, which, strauss, had, considered, setting, as, a, choral, work, generally, regarded, as, one, of, the, masterpieces, of, the, string, repertoire, metamorphosen, contains, strauss, s, most, sustained, outpouring, of, tragic, emotion, conceived, and, written, during, the, blackest, days, of, world, war, ii, the, piece, expresses, strauss, s, mourning, of, among, other, things, the, destruction, of, german, culture, including, the, bombing, of, every, great, opera, house, in, the, nation, at, the, end, of, the, war, strauss, wrote, in, his, private, diary, the, most, terrible, period, of, human, history, is, at, an, end, the, twelve, year, reign, of, bestiality, ignorance, and, anti, culture, under, the, greatest, criminals, during, which, germany, s, 2000, years, of, cultural, evolution, met, its, doom, in, april, 1945, american, soldiers, occupying, germany, at, the, end, of, the, war, arrived, at, strauss, s, garmisch, estate, as, strauss, descended, the, staircase, he, announced, to, lieutenant, milton, weiss, of, the, u, s, army, i, am, richard, strauss, the, composer, of, rosenkavalier, and, salome, lt, weiss, who, was, also, a, musician, nodded, in, recognition, an, off, limits, sign, was, subsequently, placed, on, the, lawn, to, protect, strauss, the, american, oboist, john, de, lancie, who, knew, strauss, s, orchestral, writing, for, oboe, thoroughly, was, in, the, army, unit, and, asked, strauss, to, compose, an, oboe, concerto, initially, dismissive, of, the, idea, strauss, completed, this, late, work, his, oboe, concerto, before, the, end, of, the, year, the, metaphor, indian, summer, has, been, used, by, journalists, biographers, and, music, critics, notably, norman, del, mar, in, 1964, to, describe, strauss, s, late, creative, upsurge, from, 1942, to, the, end, of, his, life, the, events, of, world, war, ii, seemed, to, bring, the, composer, who, had, grown, old, tired, and, a, little, jaded, into, focus, the, major, works, of, the, last, years, of, strauss, s, life, written, in, his, late, 70s, and, 80s, include, among, others, his, horn, concerto, no, 2, metamorphosen, his, oboe, concerto, his, duet, concertino, for, clarinet, and, bassoon, and, his, four, last, songs, in, june, 1945, after, finishing, metamorphosen, strauss, completed, his, sonatina, no, 2, in, e, flat, major, fr, hliche, werkstatt, for, 16, wind, instruments, which, he, had, begun, in, early, 1944, at, the, end, of, the, score, he, wrote, to, the, manes, of, the, divine, mozart, at, the, end, of, a, life, full, of, thankfulness, like, those, of, most, germans, strauss, s, bank, accounts, were, frozen, and, many, of, his, assets, seized, by, american, forces, now, elderly, and, with, very, few, resources, left, strauss, and, his, wife, left, germany, for, switzerland, in, october, 1945, where, they, settled, in, a, hotel, outside, zurich, and, later, at, the, montreux, palace, hotel, in, montreux, there, they, met, the, swiss, music, critic, willy, schuh, who, became, strauss, s, biographer, short, of, money, in, 1947, strauss, embarked, on, his, last, international, tour, a, three, week, trip, to, london, in, which, he, conducted, several, of, his, tone, poems, and, excerpts, of, his, operas, and, was, present, during, a, complete, staging, of, elektra, by, the, bbc, the, trip, was, a, critical, success, and, provided, him, and, his, wife, with, some, much, needed, money, from, may, to, september, 1948, just, before, his, death, strauss, composed, the, four, last, songs, which, deal, with, the, subject, of, dying, the, last, one, im, abendrot, at, sunset, ends, with, the, line, is, this, perhaps, death, the, question, is, not, answered, in, words, but, instead, strauss, quotes, the, transfiguration, theme, from, his, earlier, tone, poem, death, and, transfiguration, meant, to, symbolize, the, transfiguration, and, fulfilment, of, the, soul, after, death, in, june, 1948, he, was, cleared, of, any, wrong, doing, by, a, denazification, tribunal, in, munich, that, same, month, he, orchestrated, ruhe, meine, seele, a, song, that, he, had, originally, composed, in, 1894, in, december, 1948, strauss, was, hospitalized, for, several, weeks, after, undergoing, bladder, surgery, his, health, rapidly, deteriorated, after, that, and, he, conducted, his, last, performance, the, end, of, act, 2, of, der, rosenkavalier, at, the, prinzregententheater, in, munich, during, celebrations, of, his, 85th, birthday, on, 10, june, 1949, on, 15, august, he, suffered, a, heart, attack, and, he, quietly, died, of, kidney, failure, in, his, sleep, shortly, after, 2, pm, on, 8, september, 1949, in, garmisch, partenkirchen, west, germany, from, his, death, bed, typical, of, his, enduring, sense, of, humour, he, commented, to, his, daughter, in, law, alice, dying, is, just, as, i, composed, it, in, tod, und, verkl, rung, georg, solti, who, had, arranged, strauss, s, 85th, birthday, celebration, also, directed, an, orchestra, during, strauss, s, burial, the, conductor, later, described, how, during, the, singing, of, the, famous, trio, from, rosenkavalier, each, singer, broke, down, in, tears, and, dropped, out, of, the, ensemble, but, they, recovered, themselves, and, we, all, ended, together, strauss, s, wife, pauline, de, ahna, died, eight, months, later, on, 13, may, 1950, at, the, age, of, 88, strauss, himself, declared, in, 1947, with, characteristic, self, deprecation, i, may, not, be, a, first, rate, composer, but, i, am, a, first, class, second, rate, composer, the, canadian, pianist, glenn, gould, described, strauss, in, 1962, as, the, greatest, musical, figure, who, has, lived, in, this, century, some, of, strauss, s, first, compositions, were, solo, instrumental, and, chamber, works, these, pieces, include, early, compositions, for, piano, solo, in, a, conservative, harmonic, style, many, of, which, are, lost, two, piano, trios, 1877, and, 1878, a, string, quartet, 1881, a, piano, sonata, 1882, a, cello, sonata, 1883, a, piano, quartet, 1885, a, violin, sonata, 1888, as, well, as, a, serenade, 1882, and, a, longer, suite, 1884, both, scored, for, double, wind, quintet, plus, two, additional, horns, and, contrabassoon, after, 1890, strauss, composed, very, infrequently, for, chamber, groups, his, energies, being, almost, completely, absorbed, with, large, scale, orchestral, works, and, operas, four, of, his, chamber, pieces, are, actually, arrangements, of, portions, of, his, operas, including, the, daphne, etude, for, solo, violin, and, the, string, sextet, which, is, the, overture, to, his, final, opera, capriccio, his, last, independent, chamber, work, an, allegretto, in, e, major, for, violin, and, piano, dates, from, 1948, he, also, composed, two, large, scale, works, for, wind, ensemble, during, this, period, sonatina, no, 1, from, an, invalid, s, workshop, 1943, and, sonatina, no, 2, happy, workshop, 1946, both, scored, for, double, wind, quintet, plus, two, additional, horns, a, third, clarinet, in, c, bassett, horn, bass, clarinet, and, contrabassoon, strauss, wrote, two, early, symphonies, symphony, no, 1, 1880, and, symphony, no, 2, 1884, however, strauss, s, style, began, to, truly, develop, and, change, when, in, 1885, he, met, alexander, ritter, a, noted, composer, and, violinist, and, the, husband, of, one, of, richard, wagner, s, nieces, it, was, ritter, who, persuaded, strauss, to, abandon, the, conservative, style, of, his, youth, and, begin, writing, tone, poems, he, also, introduced, strauss, to, the, essays, of, wagner, and, the, writings, of, arthur, schopenhauer, strauss, went, on, to, conduct, one, of, ritter, s, operas, and, at, strauss, s, request, ritter, later, wrote, a, poem, describing, the, events, depicted, in, strauss, s, tone, poem, death, and, transfiguration, the, new, influences, from, ritter, resulted, in, what, is, widely, regarded, as, strauss, s, first, piece, to, show, his, mature, personality, the, tone, poem, don, juan, 1888, which, displays, a, new, kind, of, virtuosity, in, its, bravura, orchestral, manner, strauss, went, on, to, write, a, series, of, increasingly, ambitious, tone, poems, death, and, transfiguration, 1889, till, eulenspiegel, s, merry, pranks, 1895, also, sprach, zarathustra, 1896, don, quixote, 1897, ein, heldenleben, 1898, symphonia, domestica, 1903, and, an, alpine, symphony, 1911, 1915, one, commentator, has, observed, of, these, works, that, no, orchestra, could, exist, without, his, tone, poems, written, to, celebrate, the, glories, of, the, post, wagnerian, symphony, orchestra, james, hepokoski, notes, a, shift, in, strauss, s, technique, in, the, tone, poems, occurring, between, 1892, and, 1893, it, was, after, this, point, that, strauss, rejected, the, philosophy, of, schopenhauer, and, began, more, forcefully, critiquing, the, institution, of, the, symphony, and, the, symphonic, poem, thereby, differentiating, the, second, cycle, of, tone, poems, from, the, first, strauss, s, output, of, works, for, solo, instrument, or, instruments, with, orchestra, was, fairly, extensive, the, most, famous, include, two, concertos, for, horn, which, are, still, part, of, the, standard, repertoire, of, most, horn, soloists, horn, concerto, no, 1, 1883, and, horn, concerto, no, 2, 1942, the, romanze, for, cello, and, orchestra, 1883, a, violin, concerto, in, d, minor, 1882, the, burleske, for, piano, and, orchestra, 1885, revised, 1889, the, tone, poem, don, quixote, for, cello, viola, and, orchestra, 1897, the, well, known, late, oboe, concerto, in, d, major, 1945, and, the, duet, concertino, for, clarinet, and, bassoon, with, string, orchestra, which, was, one, of, his, last, works, 1948, around, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, strauss, turned, his, attention, to, opera, his, first, two, attempts, in, the, genre, guntram, 1894, and, feuersnot, 1901, were, controversial, works, guntram, was, the, first, significant, critical, failure, of, strauss, s, career, and, feuersnot, was, considered, obscene, by, some, critics, in, 1905, strauss, produced, salome, a, somewhat, dissonant, modernist, opera, based, on, the, play, by, oscar, wilde, which, produced, a, passionate, reaction, from, audiences, the, premiere, was, a, major, success, with, the, artists, taking, more, than, 38, curtain, calls, many, later, performances, of, the, opera, were, also, successful, not, only, with, the, general, public, but, also, with, strauss, s, peers, maurice, ravel, said, that, salome, was, stupendous, gustav, mahler, described, it, as, a, live, volcano, a, subterranean, fire, strauss, reputedly, financed, his, house, in, garmisch, partenkirchen, completely, from, the, revenues, generated, by, the, opera, as, with, the, later, elektra, salome, features, an, extremely, taxing, lead, soprano, role, strauss, often, remarked, that, he, preferred, writing, for, the, female, voice, which, is, apparent, in, these, two, sister, operas, the, male, parts, are, almost, entirely, smaller, roles, included, only, to, supplement, the, soprano, s, performance, strauss, s, next, opera, was, elektra, 1909, which, took, his, use, of, dissonance, even, further, in, particular, with, the, elektra, chord, elektra, was, also, the, first, opera, in, which, strauss, collaborated, with, the, poet, hugo, von, hofmannsthal, as, his, librettist, the, two, subsequently, worked, together, on, numerous, occasions, for, his, later, works, with, hofmannsthal, strauss, moderated, his, harmonic, language, he, used, a, more, lush, melodic, late, romantic, style, based, on, wagnerian, chromatic, harmonies, that, he, had, used, in, his, tone, poems, with, much, less, dissonance, and, exhibiting, immense, virtuosity, in, orchestral, writing, and, tone, color, this, resulted, in, operas, such, as, der, rosenkavalier, 1911, having, great, public, success, strauss, continued, to, produce, operas, at, regular, intervals, until, 1942, with, hofmannsthal, he, created, ariadne, auf, naxos, 1912, die, frau, ohne, schatten, 1919, die, gyptische, helena, 1928, and, arabella, 1933, for, intermezzo, 1924, strauss, provided, his, own, libretto, die, schweigsame, frau, 1935, was, composed, with, stefan, zweig, as, librettist, friedenstag, 1935, 36, and, daphne, 1937, both, had, a, libretto, by, joseph, gregor, and, stefan, zweig, and, die, liebe, der, danae, 1940, was, with, joseph, gregor, strauss, s, final, opera, capriccio, 1942, had, a, libretto, by, clemens, krauss, although, the, genesis, for, it, came, from, stefan, zweig, and, joseph, gregor, strauss, was, a, prolific, composer, of, lieder, he, often, composed, them, with, the, voice, of, his, wife, in, mind, his, lieder, were, written, for, voice, and, piano, and, he, orchestrated, several, of, them, after, the, fact, in, 1894, 1895, around, the, age, of, 30, he, published, several, well, known, songs, including, ruhe, meine, seele, c, cilie, morgen, heimliche, aufforderung, and, traum, durch, die, d, mmerung, in, 1918, after, a, long, hiatus, devoted, to, opera, he, wrote, sechs, lieder, op, 68, also, called, brentano, lieder, he, completed, his, works, in, the, genre, in, 1948, with, four, last, songs, for, soprano, and, orchestra, he, reportedly, composed, these, with, kirsten, flagstad, in, mind, and, she, gave, the, first, performance, which, was, recorded, strauss, s, songs, have, always, been, popular, with, audiences, and, performers, and, are, generally, considered, by, musicologists, along, with, many, of, his, other, compositions, to, be, masterpieces, time, magazine, suggested, in, 1927, that, he, wrote, music, to, test, how, much, cacophony, dissonance, exaggeration, and, clowning, his, audiences, would, applaud, early, in, strauss, s, career, eminent, musicologist, hugo, riemann, reflected, his, last, works, only, too, clearly, reveal, his, determination, to, make, a, sensation, at, all, costs, until, the, 1980s, strauss, was, regarded, by, some, post, modern, musicologists, as, a, conservative, backward, looking, composer, but, re, examination, of, and, new, research, on, the, composer, has, re, evaluated, his, place, as, that, of, a, modernist, albeit, one, who, still, utilized, and, sometimes, revered, tonality, and, lush, orchestration, strauss, is, noted, for, his, pioneering, subtleties, of, orchestration, combined, with, an, advanced, harmonic, style, when, he, first, played, strauss, at, a, university, production, of, ariadne, auf, naxos, the, conductor, mark, elder, was, flabbergasted, i, had, no, idea, music, could, do, the, things, he, was, doing, with, harmony, and, melody, strauss, s, music, had, a, considerable, influence, on, composers, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, b, la, bart, k, heard, also, sprach, zarathustra, in, 1902, and, later, said, that, the, work, contained, the, seeds, for, a, new, life, a, straussian, influence, is, clearly, present, in, his, works, of, that, period, including, his, first, string, quartet, kossuth, and, bluebeard, s, castle, karol, szymanowski, was, also, greatly, influenced, by, strauss, reflected, in, such, pieces, as, his, concert, overture, and, his, first, and, second, symphonies, and, his, opera, hagith, which, was, modeled, after, salome, english, composers, were, also, influenced, by, strauss, from, edward, elgar, in, his, concert, overture, in, the, south, alassio, and, other, works, to, benjamin, britten, in, his, opera, writing, many, contemporary, composers, recognise, a, debt, to, strauss, including, john, adams, and, john, corigliano, strauss, s, musical, style, played, a, major, role, in, the, development, of, film, music, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, the, style, of, his, musical, depictions, of, character, don, juan, till, eulenspiegel, the, hero, and, emotions, found, their, way, into, the, lexicon, of, film, music, film, music, historian, timothy, schuerer, wrote, the, elements, of, post, late, romantic, music, that, had, greatest, impact, on, scoring, are, its, lush, sound, expanded, harmonic, language, chromaticism, use, of, program, music, and, use, of, leitmotifs, hollywood, composers, found, the, post, romantic, idiom, compatible, with, their, efforts, in, scoring, film, max, steiner, and, erich, korngold, came, from, the, same, musical, world, as, strauss, and, were, quite, naturally, drawn, to, write, in, his, style, as, film, historian, roy, prendergast, wrote, when, confronted, with, the, kind, of, dramatic, problem, films, presented, to, them, steiner, korngold, and, newman, looked, to, wagner, puccini, verdi, and, strauss, for, the, answers, to, dramatic, film, scoring, later, the, opening, to, also, sprach, zarathustra, became, one, of, the, best, known, pieces, of, film, music, when, stanley, kubrick, used, it, in, his, 1968, movie, 2001, a, space, odyssey, the, film, music, of, john, williams, has, continued, the, strauss, influence, in, scores, for, mainstream, hits, such, as, superman, and, star, wars, strauss, has, always, been, popular, with, audiences, in, the, concert, hall, and, continues, to, be, so, he, has, consistently, been, in, the, top, 10, composers, most, performed, by, symphony, orchestras, in, the, us, and, canada, over, the, period, 2002, 2010, he, is, also, in, the, top, 5, of, 20th, century, composers, born, after, 1860, in, terms, of, the, number, of, currently, available, recordings, of, his, works, strauss, as, conductor, made, a, large, number, of, recordings, both, of, his, own, music, as, well, as, music, by, german, and, austrian, composers, his, 1929, performances, of, till, eulenspiegel, s, merry, pranks, and, don, juan, with, the, berlin, state, opera, orchestra, have, long, been, considered, the, best, of, his, early, electrical, recordings, in, the, first, complete, performance, of, his, an, alpine, symphony, made, in, 1941, and, later, released, by, emi, strauss, used, the, full, complement, of, percussion, instruments, required, in, this, work, koch, legacy, has, also, released, strauss, s, recordings, of, overtures, by, gluck, carl, maria, von, weber, peter, cornelius, and, wagner, the, preference, for, german, and, austrian, composers, in, germany, in, the, 1920s, through, the, 1940s, was, typical, of, the, german, nationalism, that, existed, after, world, war, i, strauss, clearly, capitalized, on, national, pride, for, the, great, german, speaking, composers, there, were, many, other, recordings, including, some, taken, from, radio, broadcasts, and, concerts, during, the, 1930s, and, early, 1940s, the, sheer, volume, of, recorded, performances, would, undoubtedly, yield, some, definitive, performances, from, a, very, capable, and, rather, forward, looking, conductor, in, 1944, strauss, celebrated, his, 80th, birthday, and, conducted, the, vienna, philharmonic, in, recordings, of, his, own, major, orchestral, works, as, well, as, his, seldom, heard, schlagobers, whipped, cream, ballet, music, some, find, more, feeling, in, these, performances, than, in, strauss, s, earlier, recordings, which, were, recorded, on, the, magnetophon, tape, recording, equipment, vanguard, records, later, issued, the, recordings, on, lps, some, of, these, recordings, have, been, reissued, on, cd, by, preiser, the, last, recording, made, by, strauss, was, on, 19, october, 1947, live, at, the, royal, albert, hall, in, london, where, he, conducted, the, philharmonia, orchestra, in, his, burleske, for, piano, and, orchestra, alfred, blumen, piano, don, juan, and, sinfonia, domestica, strauss, also, made, live, recording, player, piano, music, rolls, for, the, hupfeld, system, and, in, 1906, ten, recordings, for, the, reproducing, piano, welte, mignon, all, of, which, survive, today, strauss, was, also, the, composer, of, the, music, on, the, first, cd, to, be, commercially, released, deutsche, grammophon, s, 1983, release, of, their, 1980, recording, of, herbert, von, karajan, conducting, the, alpine, symphony, pierre, boulez, has, said, that, strauss, the, conductor, was, a, complete, master, of, his, trade, music, critic, harold, c, schonberg, writes, that, while, strauss, was, a, very, fine, conductor, he, often, put, scant, effort, into, his, recordings, schonberg, focused, primarily, on, strauss, s, recordings, of, mozart, s, symphony, no, 40, and, beethoven, s, symphony, no, 7, as, well, as, noting, that, strauss, played, a, breakneck, version, of, beethoven, s, 9th, symphony, in, about, 45, minutes, concerning, beethoven, s, 7th, symphony, schonberg, wrote, there, is, almost, never, a, ritard, or, a, change, in, expression, or, nuance, the, slow, movement, is, almost, as, fast, as, the, following, vivace, and, the, last, movement, with, a, big, cut, in, it, is, finished, in, 4, minutes, 25, seconds, it, should, run, between, 7, and, 8, minutes, he, also, complained, that, the, mozart, symphony, had, no, force, no, charm, no, inflection, with, a, metronomic, rigidity, peter, gutmann, s, 1994, review, for, classicalnotes, com, says, the, performances, of, the, beethoven, 5th, and, 7th, symphonies, as, well, as, mozart, s, last, three, symphonies, are, actually, quite, good, even, if, they, are, sometimes, unconventional, gutmann, wrote, it, is, true, as, the, critics, suggest, that, the, readings, forego, overt, emotion, but, what, emerges, instead, is, a, solid, sense, of, structure, letting, the, music, speak, convincingly, for, itself, it, is, also, true, that, strauss, s, tempos, are, generally, swift, but, this, too, contributes, to, the, structural, cohesion, and, in, any, event, is, fully, in, keeping, with, our, modern, outlook, in, which, speed, is, a, virtue, and, attention, spans, are, defined, more, by, mtv, clips, and, news, sound, bites, than, by, evenings, at, the, opera, and, thousand, page, novels, his, honors, included, category
