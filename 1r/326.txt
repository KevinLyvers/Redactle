most, successful, plays, the, royalties, from, which, were, applied, toward, her, care, the, devastating, effects, of, rose, s, treatment, may, have, contributed, to, williams, s, alcoholism, and,

who, had, become, williams, s, personal, secretary, took, on, most, of, the, details, of, their, domestic, life, he, provided, a, period, of, happiness, and, stability, acting, as, a, balance, to, the, playwright, s, frequent, bouts, with, depression, williams, feared, that, like, his, sister, rose, he, would, fall, into, insanity, his, years, with, merlo, in, an, apartment, in, manhattan, and, a, modest, house, in, key, west, florida, were, williams, s, happiest, and, most, productive, shortly, after, their, breakup, merlo, was, diagnosed, with, inoperable, lung, cancer, williams, returned, to, him, and, cared, for, him, until, his, death, on, september, 20, 1963, in, the, years, following, merlo, s, death, williams, descended, into, a, period, of, nearly, catatonic, depression, and,

alone, he, feared, old, age, and, losing, his, sexual, appeal, to, younger, gay, men, in, the, 1970s, when, he, was, in, his, 60s, williams, had, a, lengthy, relationship, with, robert, carroll, a, vietnam, war, veteran, and, aspiring, writer, in, his, 20s, williams, had, deep, affection, for, carroll, and, respect, for, what, he, saw, as, the, younger, man, s, talents, along, with, williams, s, sister, rose, carroll, was, one, of, the, two, people, who, received, a, bequest, in, williams, s, will, williams, described, carroll, s, behavior, as, a, combination, of, sweetness, and, beastliness, because, carroll, had, a, drug, problem, as, did, williams, friends, including, maria, britneva, saw, the, relationship, as, destructive, williams, wrote, that, carroll, played, on, his, acute, loneliness, as, an, aging, gay, man, when, the, two, men, broke, up, in, 1979, williams, called, carroll, a, twerp, but, they, remained, friends, until, williams, died, four, years, later, on,
