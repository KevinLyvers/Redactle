destruction, and, replacement, by, a, new, system, known, as, the, socialist, mode, of, production, for, marx, class, antagonisms, under, capitalism, owing, in, part, to, its, instability, and,

borussian, korps, although, his, grades, in, the, first, term, were, good, they, soon, deteriorated, leading, his, father, to, force, a, transfer, to, the, more, serious, and, academic, university, of, berlin, spending, summer, and, autumn, 1836, in, trier, marx, became, more, serious, about, his, studies, and, his, life, he, became, engaged, to, jenny, von, westphalen, an, educated, member, of, the, petty, nobility, who, had, known, marx, since, childhood, as, she, had, broken, off, her, engagement, with, a, young, aristocrat, to, be, with, marx, their, relationship, was, socially, controversial, owing, to, the, differences, between, their, religious, and, class, origins, but, marx, befriended, her, father, ludwig, von, westphalen, a, liberal, aristocrat, and, later, dedicated, his, doctoral, thesis, to, him, seven, years, after, their, engagement, on, 19, june, 1843, they, married, in, a, protestant, church, in, kreuznach, in, october, 1836, marx, arrived, in, berlin,

progressive, hegelian, standpoint, elaborated, on, rational, development, in, history, by, emphasising, particularly, its, libertarian, aspects, and, the, importance, of, social, question, and, of, karl, von, savigny, who, represented, the, historical, school, of, law, although, studying, law, he, was, fascinated, by, philosophy, and, looked, for, a, way, to, combine, the, two, believing, that, without, philosophy, nothing, could, be, accomplished, marx, became, interested, in, the, recently, deceased, german, philosopher, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, whose, ideas, were, then, widely, debated, among, european, philosophical, circles, during, a, convalescence, in, stralau, he, joined, the, doctor, s, club, doktorklub, a, student, group, which, discussed, hegelian, ideas, and, through, them, became, involved, with, a, group, of, radical, thinkers, known, as, the, young, hegelians, in, 1837, they, gathered, around, ludwig, feuerbach, and, bruno, bauer, with, marx, developing, a, particularly, close, friendship, with, adolf, rutenberg, like, marx, the, young, hegelians, were, critical, of, hegel, s, metaphysical, assumptions, but, adopted, his, dialectical, method, to, criticise, established, society, politics, and, religion, from, a, left, wing, perspective, marx, s, father, died, in, may, 1838, resulting, in, a, diminished, income, for, the, family, marx, had, been, emotionally, close, to, his, father, and, treasured, his, memory, after, his, death, by, 1837, marx, was, writing, both, fiction, and, non, fiction, having, completed, a, short, novel, scorpion, and, felix, a, drama, oulanem, as, well, as, a, number, of, love, poems, dedicated, to, his, wife, none, of, this, early, work, was, published, during, his, lifetime, the, love, poems, were, published, posthumously, in, the, collected, works, of, karl, marx, and, frederick, engels, volume, 1, marx, soon, abandoned, fiction, for, other, pursuits, including, the, study, of, both, english, and, italian, art, history, and, the, translation, of, latin, classics, he, began, co, operating, with, bruno, bauer, on, editing, hegel, s, philosophy, of, religion, in, 1840, marx, was, also, engaged, in, writing, his, doctoral, thesis, the, difference, between, the, democritean, and, epicurean, philosophy, of, nature, which, he, completed, in, 1841, it, was, described, as, a, daring, and, original, piece, of, work, in, which, marx, set, out, to, show, that, theology, must, yield, to, the, superior, wisdom, of, philosophy, the, essay, was, controversial, particularly, among, the, conservative, professors, at, the, university, of, berlin, marx, decided, instead, to, submit, his, thesis, to, the, more, liberal, university, of, jena, whose, faculty, awarded, him, his, ph, d, in, april, 1841, as, marx, and, bauer, were, both, atheists, in, march, 1841, they, began, plans, for, a, journal, entitled, archiv, des, atheismus, atheistic, archives, but, it, never, came, to, fruition, in, july, marx, and, bauer, took, a, trip, to, bonn, from, berlin, there, they, scandalised, their, class, by, getting, drunk, laughing, in, church, and, galloping, through, the, streets, on, donkeys, marx, was, considering, an, academic, career, but, this, path, was, barred, by, the, government, s, growing, opposition, to, classical, liberalism, and, the, young, hegelians, marx, moved, to, cologne, in, 1842, where, he, became, a, journalist, writing, for, the, radical, newspaper, rheinische, zeitung, rhineland, news, expressing, his, early, views, on, socialism, and, his, developing, interest, in, economics, marx, criticised, right, wing, european, governments, as, well, as, figures, in, the, liberal, and, socialist, movements, whom, he, thought, ineffective, or, counter, productive, the, newspaper, attracted, the, attention, of, the, prussian, government, censors, who, checked, every, issue, for, seditious, material, before, printing, which, marx, lamented, our, newspaper, has, to, be, presented, to, the, police, to, be, sniffed, at, and, if, the, police, nose, smells, anything, un, christian, or, un, prussian, the, newspaper, is, not, allowed, to, appear, after, the, rheinische, zeitung, published, an, article, strongly, criticising, the, russian, monarchy, tsar, nicholas, i, requested, it, be, banned, and, prussia, s, government, complied, in, 1843, in, 1843, marx, became, co, editor, of, a, new, radical, left, wing, parisian, newspaper, the, deutsch, franz, sische, jahrb, cher, german, french, annals, then, being, set, up, by, the, german, activist, arnold, ruge, to, bring, together, german, and, french, radicals, therefore, marx, and, his, wife, moved, to, paris, in, october, 1843, initially, living, with, ruge, and, his, wife, communally, at, 23, rue, vaneau, they, found, the, living, conditions, difficult, so, moved, out, following, the, birth, of, their, daughter, jenny, in, 1844, although, intended, to, attract, writers, from, both, france, and, the, german, states, the, jahrb, cher, was, dominated, by, the, latter, and, the, only, non, german, writer, was, the, exiled, russian, anarchist, collectivist, mikhail, bakunin, marx, contributed, two, essays, to, the, paper, introduction, to, a, contribution, to, the, critique, of, hegel, s, philosophy, of, right, and, on, the, jewish, question, the, latter, introducing, his, belief, that, the, proletariat, were, a, revolutionary, force, and, marking, his, embrace, of, communism, only, one, issue, was, published, but, it, was, relatively, successful, largely, owing, to, the, inclusion, of, heinrich, heine, s, satirical, odes, on, king, ludwig, of, bavaria, leading, the, german, states, to, ban, it, and, seize, imported, copies, ruge, nevertheless, refused, to, fund, the, publication, of, further, issues, and, his, friendship, with, marx, broke, down, after, the, paper, s, collapse, marx, began, writing, for, the, only, uncensored, german, language, radical, newspaper, left, vorw, rts, forward, based, in, paris, the, paper, was, connected, to, the, league, of, the, just, a, utopian, socialist, secret, society, of, workers, and, artisans, marx, attended, some, of, their, meetings, but, did, not, join, in, vorw, rts, marx, refined, his, views, on, socialism, based, upon, hegelian, and, feuerbachian, ideas, of, dialectical, materialism, at, the, same, time, criticising, liberals, and, other, socialists, operating, in, europe, on, 28, august, 1844, marx, met, the, german, socialist, friedrich, engels, at, the, caf, de, la, r, gence, beginning, a, lifelong, friendship, engels, showed, marx, his, recently, published, the, condition, of, the, working, class, in, england, in, 1844, convincing, marx, that, the, working, class, would, be, the, agent, and, instrument, of, the, final, revolution, in, history, soon, marx, and, engels, were, collaborating, on, a, criticism, of, the, philosophical, ideas, of, marx, s, former, friend, bruno, bauer, this, work, was, published, in, 1845, as, the, holy, family, although, critical, of, bauer, marx, was, increasingly, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, the, young, hegelians, max, stirner, and, ludwig, feuerbach, but, eventually, marx, and, engels, abandoned, feuerbachian, materialism, as, well, during, the, time, that, he, lived, at, 38, rue, vaneau, in, paris, from, october, 1843, until, january, 1845, marx, engaged, in, an, intensive, study, of, political, economy, adam, smith, david, ricardo, james, mill, etc, the, french, socialists, especially, claude, henri, st, simon, and, charles, fourier, and, the, history, of, france, the, study, of, and, critique, of, political, economy, is, a, project, that, marx, would, pursue, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, would, result, in, his, major, economic, work, the, three, volume, series, called, das, kapital, marxism, is, based, in, large, part, on, three, influences, hegel, s, dialectics, french, utopian, socialism, and, british, political, economy, together, with, his, earlier, study, of, hegel, s, dialectics, the, studying, that, marx, did, during, this, time, in, paris, meant, that, all, major, components, of, marxism, were, in, place, by, the, autumn, of, 1844, marx, was, constantly, being, pulled, away, from, his, critique, of, political, economy, not, only, by, the, usual, daily, demands, of, the, time, but, additionally, by, editing, a, radical, newspaper, and, later, by, organising, and, directing, the, efforts, of, a, political, party, during, years, of, potentially, revolutionary, popular, uprisings, of, the, citizenry, still, marx, was, always, drawn, back, to, his, studies, where, he, sought, to, understand, the, inner, workings, of, capitalism, an, outline, of, marxism, had, definitely, formed, in, the, mind, of, karl, marx, by, late, 1844, indeed, many, features, of, the, marxist, view, of, the, world, had, been, worked, out, in, great, detail, but, marx, needed, to, write, down, all, of, the, details, of, his, world, view, to, further, clarify, the, new, critique, of, political, economy, in, his, own, mind, accordingly, marx, wrote, the, economic, and, philosophical, manuscripts, these, manuscripts, covered, numerous, topics, detailing, marx, s, concept, of, alienated, labour, by, the, spring, of, 1845, his, continued, study, of, political, economy, capital, and, capitalism, had, led, marx, to, the, belief, that, the, new, critique, of, political, economy, he, was, espousing, that, of, scientific, socialism, needed, to, be, built, on, the, base, of, a, thoroughly, developed, materialistic, view, of, the, world, the, economic, and, philosophical, manuscripts, of, 1844, had, been, written, between, april, and, august, 1844, but, soon, marx, recognised, that, the, manuscripts, had, been, influenced, by, some, inconsistent, ideas, of, ludwig, feuerbach, accordingly, marx, recognised, the, need, to, break, with, feuerbach, s, philosophy, in, favour, of, historical, materialism, thus, a, year, later, in, april, 1845, after, moving, from, paris, to, brussels, marx, wrote, his, eleven, theses, on, feuerbach, the, theses, on, feuerbach, are, best, known, for, thesis, 11, which, states, that, philosophers, have, only, interpreted, the, world, in, various, ways, the, point, is, to, change, it, this, work, contains, marx, s, criticism, of, materialism, for, being, contemplative, idealism, for, reducing, practice, to, theory, and, overall, philosophy, for, putting, abstract, reality, above, the, physical, world, it, thus, introduced, the, first, glimpse, at, marx, s, historical, materialism, an, argument, that, the, world, is, changed, not, by, ideas, but, by, actual, physical, material, activity, and, practice, in, 1845, after, receiving, a, request, from, the, prussian, king, the, french, government, shut, down, vorw, rts, with, the, interior, minister, fran, ois, guizot, expelling, marx, from, france, unable, either, to, stay, in, france, or, to, move, to, germany, marx, decided, to, emigrate, to, brussels, in, belgium, in, february, 1845, however, to, stay, in, belgium, he, had, to, pledge, not, to, publish, anything, on, the, subject, of, contemporary, politics, in, brussels, marx, associated, with, other, exiled, socialists, from, across, europe, including, moses, hess, karl, heinzen, and, joseph, weydemeyer, in, april, 1845, engels, moved, from, barmen, in, germany, to, brussels, to, join, marx, and, the, growing, cadre, of, members, of, the, league, of, the, just, now, seeking, home, in, brussels, later, mary, burns, engels, long, time, companion, left, manchester, england, to, join, engels, in, brussels, in, mid, july, 1845, marx, and, engels, left, brussels, for, england, to, visit, the, leaders, of, the, chartists, a, working, class, movement, in, britain, this, was, marx, s, first, trip, to, england, and, engels, was, an, ideal, guide, for, the, trip, engels, had, already, spent, two, years, living, in, manchester, from, november, 1842, to, august, 1844, not, only, did, engels, already, know, the, english, language, but, he, had, also, developed, a, close, relationship, with, many, chartist, leaders, indeed, engels, was, serving, as, a, reporter, for, many, chartist, and, socialist, english, newspapers, marx, used, the, trip, as, an, opportunity, to, examine, the, economic, resources, available, for, study, in, various, libraries, in, london, and, manchester, in, collaboration, with, engels, marx, also, set, about, writing, a, book, which, is, often, seen, as, his, best, treatment, of, the, concept, of, historical, materialism, the, german, ideology, in, this, work, marx, broke, with, ludwig, feuerbach, bruno, bauer, max, stirner, and, the, rest, of, the, young, hegelians, while, he, also, broke, with, karl, gr, n, and, other, true, socialists, whose, philosophies, were, still, based, in, part, on, idealism, in, german, ideology, marx, and, engels, finally, completed, their, philosophy, which, was, based, solely, on, materialism, as, the, sole, motor, force, in, history, german, ideology, is, written, in, a, humorously, satirical, form, but, even, this, satirical, form, did, not, save, the, work, from, censorship, like, so, many, other, early, writings, of, his, german, ideology, would, not, be, published, in, marx, s, lifetime, and, would, be, published, only, in, 1932, after, completing, german, ideology, marx, turned, to, a, work, that, was, intended, to, clarify, his, own, position, regarding, the, theory, and, tactics, of, a, truly, revolutionary, proletarian, movement, operating, from, the, standpoint, of, a, truly, scientific, materialist, philosophy, this, work, was, intended, to, draw, a, distinction, between, the, utopian, socialists, and, marx, s, own, scientific, socialist, philosophy, whereas, the, utopians, believed, that, people, must, be, persuaded, one, person, at, a, time, to, join, the, socialist, movement, the, way, a, person, must, be, persuaded, to, adopt, any, different, belief, marx, knew, that, people, would, tend, on, most, occasions, to, act, in, accordance, with, their, own, economic, interests, thus, appealing, to, an, entire, class, the, working, class, in, this, case, with, a, broad, appeal, to, the, class, s, best, material, interest, would, be, the, best, way, to, mobilise, the, broad, mass, of, that, class, to, make, a, revolution, and, change, society, this, was, the, intent, of, the, new, book, that, marx, was, planning, but, to, get, the, manuscript, past, the, government, censors, he, called, the, book, the, poverty, of, philosophy, 1847, and, offered, it, as, a, response, to, the, petty, bourgeois, philosophy, of, the, french, anarchist, socialist, pierre, joseph, proudhon, as, expressed, in, his, book, the, philosophy, of, poverty, 1840, these, books, laid, the, foundation, for, marx, and, engels, s, most, famous, work, a, political, pamphlet, that, has, since, come, to, be, commonly, known, as, the, communist, manifesto, while, residing, in, brussels, in, 1846, marx, continued, his, association, with, the, secret, radical, organisation, league, of, the, just, as, noted, above, marx, thought, the, league, to, be, just, the, sort, of, radical, organisation, that, was, needed, to, spur, the, working, class, of, europe, toward, the, mass, movement, that, would, bring, about, a, working, class, revolution, however, to, organise, the, working, class, into, a, mass, movement, the, league, had, to, cease, its, secret, or, underground, orientation, and, operate, in, the, open, as, a, political, party, members, of, the, league, eventually, became, persuaded, in, this, regard, accordingly, in, june, 1847, the, league, was, reorganised, by, its, membership, into, a, new, open, above, ground, political, society, that, appealed, directly, to, the, working, classes, this, new, open, political, society, was, called, the, communist, league, both, marx, and, engels, participated, in, drawing, up, the, programme, and, organisational, principles, of, the, new, communist, league, in, late, 1847, marx, and, engels, began, writing, what, was, to, become, their, most, famous, work, a, programme, of, action, for, the, communist, league, written, jointly, by, marx, and, engels, from, december, 1847, to, january, 1848, the, communist, manifesto, was, first, published, on, 21, february, 1848, the, communist, manifesto, laid, out, the, beliefs, of, the, new, communist, league, no, longer, a, secret, society, the, communist, league, wanted, to, make, aims, and, intentions, clear, to, the, general, public, rather, than, hiding, its, beliefs, as, the, league, of, the, just, had, been, doing, the, opening, lines, of, the, pamphlet, set, forth, the, principal, basis, of, marxism, the, history, of, all, hitherto, existing, society, is, the, history, of, class, struggles, it, goes, on, to, examine, the, antagonisms, that, marx, claimed, were, arising, in, the, clashes, of, interest, between, the, bourgeoisie, the, wealthy, capitalist, class, and, the, proletariat, the, industrial, working, class, proceeding, on, from, this, the, manifesto, presents, the, argument, for, why, the, communist, league, as, opposed, to, other, socialist, and, liberal, political, parties, and, groups, at, the, time, was, truly, acting, in, the, interests, of, the, proletariat, to, overthrow, capitalist, society, and, to, replace, it, with, socialism, later, that, year, europe, experienced, a, series, of, protests, rebellions, and, often, violent, upheavals, that, became, known, as, the, revolutions, of, 1848, in, france, a, revolution, led, to, the, overthrow, of, the, monarchy, and, the, establishment, of, the, french, second, republic, marx, was, supportive, of, such, activity, and, having, recently, received, a, substantial, inheritance, from, his, father, withheld, by, his, uncle, lionel, philips, since, his, father, s, death, in, 1838, of, either, 6, 000, or, 5, 000, francs, he, allegedly, used, a, third, of, it, to, arm, belgian, workers, who, were, planning, revolutionary, action, although, the, veracity, of, these, allegations, is, disputed, the, belgian, ministry, of, justice, accused, marx, of, it, subsequently, arresting, him, and, he, was, forced, to, flee, back, to, france, where, with, a, new, republican, government, in, power, he, believed, that, he, would, be, safe, temporarily, settling, down, in, paris, marx, transferred, the, communist, league, executive, headquarters, to, the, city, and, also, set, up, a, german, workers, club, with, various, german, socialists, living, there, hoping, to, see, the, revolution, spread, to, germany, in, 1848, marx, moved, back, to, cologne, where, he, began, issuing, a, handbill, entitled, the, demands, of, the, communist, party, in, germany, in, which, he, argued, for, only, four, of, the, ten, points, of, the, communist, manifesto, believing, that, in, germany, at, that, time, the, bourgeoisie, must, overthrow, the, feudal, monarchy, and, aristocracy, before, the, proletariat, could, overthrow, the, bourgeoisie, on, 1, june, marx, started, the, publication, of, a, daily, newspaper, the, neue, rheinische, zeitung, which, he, helped, to, finance, through, his, recent, inheritance, from, his, father, designed, to, put, forward, news, from, across, europe, with, his, own, marxist, interpretation, of, events, the, newspaper, featured, marx, as, a, primary, writer, and, the, dominant, editorial, influence, despite, contributions, by, fellow, members, of, the, communist, league, according, to, friedrich, engels, it, remained, a, simple, dictatorship, by, marx, whilst, editor, of, the, paper, marx, and, the, other, revolutionary, socialists, were, regularly, harassed, by, the, police, and, marx, was, brought, to, trial, on, several, occasions, facing, various, allegations, including, insulting, the, chief, public, prosecutor, committing, a, press, misdemeanor, and, inciting, armed, rebellion, through, tax, boycotting, although, each, time, he, was, acquitted, meanwhile, the, democratic, parliament, in, prussia, collapsed, and, the, king, frederick, william, iv, introduced, a, new, cabinet, of, his, reactionary, supporters, who, implemented, counterrevolutionary, measures, to, expunge, left, wing, and, other, revolutionary, elements, from, the, country, consequently, the, neue, rheinische, zeitung, was, soon, suppressed, and, marx, was, ordered, to, leave, the, country, on, 16, may, marx, returned, to, paris, which, was, then, under, the, grip, of, both, a, reactionary, counterrevolution, and, a, cholera, epidemic, and, was, soon, expelled, by, the, city, authorities, who, considered, him, a, political, threat, with, his, wife, jenny, expecting, their, fourth, child, and, with, marx, not, able, to, move, back, to, germany, or, belgium, in, august, 1849, he, sought, refuge, in, london, marx, moved, to, london, in, early, june, 1849, and, would, remain, based, in, the, city, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, headquarters, of, the, communist, league, also, moved, to, london, however, in, the, winter, of, 1849, 1850, a, split, within, the, ranks, of, the, communist, league, occurred, when, a, faction, within, it, led, by, august, willich, and, karl, schapper, began, agitating, for, an, immediate, uprising, willich, and, schapper, believed, that, once, the, communist, league, had, initiated, the, uprising, the, entire, working, class, from, across, europe, would, rise, spontaneously, to, join, it, thus, creating, revolution, across, europe, marx, and, engels, protested, that, such, an, unplanned, uprising, on, the, part, of, the, communist, league, was, adventuristic, and, would, be, suicide, for, the, communist, league, such, an, uprising, as, that, recommended, by, the, schapper, willich, group, would, easily, be, crushed, by, the, police, and, the, armed, forces, of, the, reactionary, governments, of, europe, marx, maintained, that, this, would, spell, doom, for, the, communist, league, itself, arguing, that, changes, in, society, are, not, achieved, overnight, through, the, efforts, and, will, power, of, a, handful, of, men, they, are, instead, brought, about, through, a, scientific, analysis, of, economic, conditions, of, society, and, by, moving, toward, revolution, through, different, stages, of, social, development, in, the, present, stage, of, development, circa, 1850, following, the, defeat, of, the, uprisings, across, europe, in, 1848, he, felt, that, the, communist, league, should, encourage, the, working, class, to, unite, with, progressive, elements, of, the, rising, bourgeoisie, to, defeat, the, feudal, aristocracy, on, issues, involving, demands, for, governmental, reforms, such, as, a, constitutional, republic, with, freely, elected, assemblies, and, universal, male, suffrage, in, other, words, the, working, class, must, join, with, bourgeois, and, democratic, forces, to, bring, about, the, successful, conclusion, of, the, bourgeois, revolution, before, stressing, the, working, class, agenda, and, a, working, class, revolution, after, a, long, struggle, that, threatened, to, ruin, the, communist, league, marx, s, opinion, prevailed, and, eventually, the, willich, schapper, group, left, the, communist, league, meanwhile, marx, also, became, heavily, involved, with, the, socialist, german, workers, educational, society, the, society, held, their, meetings, in, great, windmill, street, soho, central, london, s, entertainment, district, this, organisation, was, also, racked, by, an, internal, struggle, between, its, members, some, of, whom, followed, marx, while, others, followed, the, schapper, willich, faction, the, issues, in, this, internal, split, were, the, same, issues, raised, in, the, internal, split, within, the, communist, league, but, marx, lost, the, fight, with, the, schapper, willich, faction, within, the, german, workers, educational, society, and, on, 17, september, 1850, resigned, from, the, society, in, the, early, period, in, london, marx, committed, himself, almost, exclusively, to, his, studies, such, that, his, family, endured, extreme, poverty, his, main, source, of, income, was, engels, whose, own, source, was, his, wealthy, industrialist, father, in, prussia, as, editor, of, his, own, newspaper, and, contributor, to, others, ideologically, aligned, marx, could, reach, his, audience, the, working, classes, in, london, without, finances, to, run, a, newspaper, themselves, he, and, engels, turned, to, international, journalism, at, one, stage, they, were, being, published, by, six, newspapers, from, england, the, united, states, prussia, austria, and, south, africa, marx, s, principal, earnings, came, from, his, work, as, european, correspondent, from, 1852, to, 1862, for, the, new, york, daily, tribune, 17, and, from, also, producing, articles, for, more, bourgeois, newspapers, marx, had, his, articles, translated, from, german, by, wilhelm, pieper, until, his, proficiency, in, english, had, become, adequate, the, new, york, daily, tribune, had, been, founded, in, april, 1841, by, horace, greeley, its, editorial, board, contained, progressive, bourgeois, journalists, and, publishers, among, them, george, ripley, and, the, journalist, charles, dana, who, was, editor, in, chief, dana, a, fourierist, and, an, abolitionist, was, marx, s, contact, the, tribune, was, a, vehicle, for, marx, to, reach, a, transatlantic, public, such, as, for, his, hidden, warfare, against, henry, charles, carey, the, journal, had, wide, working, class, appeal, from, its, foundation, at, two, cents, it, was, inexpensive, and, with, about, 50, 000, copies, per, issue, its, circulation, was, the, widest, in, the, united, states, 14, its, editorial, ethos, was, progressive, and, its, anti, slavery, stance, reflected, greeley, s, 82, marx, s, first, article, for, the, paper, on, the, british, parliamentary, elections, was, published, on, 21, august, 1852, on, 21, march, 1857, dana, informed, marx, that, due, to, the, economic, recession, only, one, article, a, week, would, be, paid, for, published, or, not, the, others, would, be, paid, for, only, if, published, marx, had, sent, his, articles, on, tuesdays, and, fridays, but, that, october, the, tribune, discharged, all, its, correspondents, in, europe, except, marx, and, b, taylor, and, reduced, marx, to, a, weekly, article, between, september, and, november, 1860, only, five, were, published, after, a, six, month, interval, marx, resumed, contributions, from, september, 1861, until, march, 1862, when, dana, wrote, to, inform, him, that, there, was, no, longer, space, in, the, tribune, for, reports, from, london, due, to, american, domestic, affairs, in, 1868, dana, set, up, a, rival, newspaper, the, new, york, sun, at, which, he, was, editor, in, chief, in, april, 1857, dana, invited, marx, to, contribute, articles, mainly, on, military, history, to, the, new, american, cyclopedia, an, idea, of, george, ripley, dana, s, friend, and, literary, editor, of, the, tribune, in, all, 67, marx, engels, articles, were, published, of, which, 51, were, written, by, engels, although, marx, did, some, research, for, them, in, the, british, museum, by, the, late, 1850s, american, popular, interest, in, european, affairs, waned, and, marx, s, articles, turned, to, topics, such, as, the, slavery, crisis, and, the, outbreak, of, the, american, civil, war, in, 1861, in, the, war, between, the, states, between, december, 1851, and, march, 1852, marx, worked, on, his, theoretical, work, about, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, titled, the, eighteenth, brumaire, of, louis, napoleon, in, this, he, explored, concepts, in, historical, materialism, class, struggle, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, and, victory, of, the, proletariat, over, the, bourgeois, state, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, may, be, said, to, mark, a, philosophical, boundary, distinguishing, the, young, marx, s, hegelian, idealism, and, the, more, mature, marx, s, scientific, ideology, associated, with, structural, marxism, however, not, all, scholars, accept, this, distinction, for, marx, and, engels, their, experience, of, the, revolutions, of, 1848, to, 1849, were, formative, in, the, development, of, their, theory, of, economics, and, historical, progression, after, the, failures, of, 1848, the, revolutionary, impetus, appeared, spent, and, not, to, be, renewed, without, an, economic, recession, contention, arose, between, marx, and, his, fellow, communists, whom, he, denounced, as, adventurists, marx, deemed, it, fanciful, to, propose, that, will, power, could, be, sufficient, to, create, the, revolutionary, conditions, when, in, reality, the, economic, component, was, the, necessary, requisite, the, recession, in, the, united, states, economy, in, 1852, gave, marx, and, engels, grounds, for, optimism, for, revolutionary, activity, yet, this, economy, was, seen, as, too, immature, for, a, capitalist, revolution, open, territories, on, america, s, western, frontier, dissipated, the, forces, of, social, unrest, moreover, any, economic, crisis, arising, in, the, united, states, would, not, lead, to, revolutionary, contagion, of, the, older, economies, of, individual, european, nations, which, were, closed, systems, bounded, by, their, national, borders, when, the, so, called, panic, of, 1857, in, the, united, states, spread, globally, it, broke, all, economic, theory, models, and, was, the, first, truly, global, economic, crisis, marx, continued, to, write, articles, for, the, new, york, daily, tribune, as, long, as, he, was, sure, that, the, tribune, s, editorial, policy, was, still, progressive, however, the, departure, of, charles, dana, from, the, paper, in, late, 1861, and, the, resultant, change, in, the, editorial, board, brought, about, a, new, editorial, policy, no, longer, was, the, tribune, to, be, a, strong, abolitionist, paper, dedicated, to, a, complete, union, victory, the, new, editorial, board, supported, an, immediate, peace, between, the, union, and, the, confederacy, in, the, civil, war, in, the, united, states, with, slavery, left, intact, in, the, confederacy, marx, strongly, disagreed, with, this, new, political, position, and, in, 1863, was, forced, to, withdraw, as, a, writer, for, the, tribune, in, 1864, marx, became, involved, in, the, international, workingmen, s, association, also, known, as, the, first, international, to, whose, general, council, he, was, elected, at, its, inception, in, 1864, in, that, organisation, marx, was, involved, in, the, struggle, against, the, anarchist, wing, centred, on, mikhail, bakunin, 1814, 1876, although, marx, won, this, contest, the, transfer, of, the, seat, of, the, general, council, from, london, to, new, york, in, 1872, which, marx, supported, led, to, the, decline, of, the, international, the, most, important, political, event, during, the, existence, of, the, international, was, the, paris, commune, of, 1871, when, the, citizens, of, paris, rebelled, against, their, government, and, held, the, city, for, two, months, in, response, to, the, bloody, suppression, of, this, rebellion, marx, wrote, one, of, his, most, famous, pamphlets, the, civil, war, in, france, a, defence, of, the, commune, given, the, repeated, failures, and, frustrations, of, workers, revolutions, and, movements, marx, also, sought, to, understand, and, provide, a, critique, suitable, for, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, and, hence, spent, a, great, deal, of, time, in, the, reading, room, of, the, british, museum, studying, by, 1857, marx, had, accumulated, over, 800, pages, of, notes, and, short, essays, on, capital, landed, property, wage, labour, the, state, and, foreign, trade, and, the, world, market, though, this, work, did, not, appear, in, print, until, 1939, under, the, title, outlines, of, the, critique, of, political, economy, in, 1859, marx, published, a, contribution, to, the, critique, of, political, economy, his, first, serious, critique, of, political, economy, this, work, was, intended, merely, as, a, preview, of, his, three, volume, das, kapital, english, title, capital, critique, of, political, economy, which, he, intended, to, publish, at, a, later, date, in, a, contribution, to, the, critique, of, political, economy, marx, began, to, critically, examine, axioms, and, categories, of, economic, thinking, the, work, was, enthusiastically, received, and, the, edition, sold, out, quickly, the, successful, sales, of, a, contribution, to, the, critique, of, political, economy, stimulated, marx, in, the, early, 1860s, to, finish, work, on, the, three, large, volumes, that, would, compose, his, major, life, s, work, das, kapital, and, the, theories, of, surplus, value, which, discussed, and, critiqued, the, theoreticians, of, political, economy, particularly, adam, smith, and, david, ricardo, theories, of, surplus, value, is, often, referred, to, as, the, fourth, volume, of, das, kapital, and, constitutes, one, of, the, first, comprehensive, treatises, on, the, history, of, economic, thought, in, 1867, the, first, volume, of, das, kapital, was, published, a, work, which, critically, analysed, capital, das, kapital, proposes, an, explanation, of, the, laws, of, motion, of, the, mode, of, production, from, its, origins, to, its, future, by, describing, the, dynamics, of, the, accumulation, of, capital, with, topics, such, as, the, growth, of, wage, labour, the, transformation, of, the, workplace, capital, accumulation, competition, the, banking, system, the, tendency, of, the, rate, of, profit, to, fall, and, land, rents, as, well, as, how, waged, labour, continually, reproduce, the, rule, of, capital, marx, proposes, that, the, driving, force, of, capital, is, in, the, exploitation, of, labour, whose, unpaid, work, is, the, ultimate, source, of, surplus, value, demand, for, a, russian, language, edition, of, das, kapital, soon, led, to, the, printing, of, 3, 000, copies, of, the, book, in, the, russian, language, which, was, published, on, 27, march, 1872, by, the, autumn, of, 1871, the, entire, first, edition, of, the, german, language, edition, of, das, kapital, had, been, sold, out, and, a, second, edition, was, published, volumes, ii, and, iii, of, das, kapital, remained, mere, manuscripts, upon, which, marx, continued, to, work, for, the, rest, of, his, life, both, volumes, were, published, by, engels, after, marx, s, death, volume, ii, of, das, kapital, was, prepared, and, published, by, engels, in, july, 1893, under, the, name, capital, ii, the, process, of, circulation, of, capital, volume, iii, of, das, kapital, was, published, a, year, later, in, october, 1894, under, the, name, capital, iii, the, process, of, capitalist, production, as, a, whole, theories, of, surplus, value, derived, from, the, sprawling, economic, manuscripts, of, 1861, 1863, a, second, draft, for, das, kapital, the, latter, spanning, volumes, 30, 34, of, the, collected, works, of, marx, and, engels, specifically, theories, of, surplus, value, runs, from, the, latter, part, of, the, collected, works, thirtieth, volume, through, the, end, of, their, thirty, second, volume, meanwhile, the, larger, economic, manuscripts, of, 1861, 1863, run, from, the, start, of, the, collected, works, thirtieth, volume, through, the, first, half, of, their, thirty, fourth, volume, the, latter, half, of, the, collected, works, thirty, fourth, volume, consists, of, the, surviving, fragments, of, the, economic, manuscripts, of, 1863, 1864, which, represented, a, third, draft, for, das, kapital, and, a, large, portion, of, which, is, included, as, an, appendix, to, the, penguin, edition, of, das, kapital, volume, i, a, german, language, abridged, edition, of, theories, of, surplus, value, was, published, in, 1905, and, in, 1910, this, abridged, edition, was, translated, into, english, and, published, in, 1951, in, london, but, the, complete, unabridged, edition, of, theories, of, surplus, value, was, published, as, the, fourth, volume, of, das, kapital, in, 1963, and, 1971, in, moscow, during, the, last, decade, of, his, life, marx, s, health, declined, and, he, became, incapable, of, the, sustained, effort, that, had, characterised, his, previous, work, he, did, manage, to, comment, substantially, on, contemporary, politics, particularly, in, germany, and, russia, his, critique, of, the, gotha, programme, opposed, the, tendency, of, his, followers, wilhelm, liebknecht, and, august, bebel, to, compromise, with, the, state, socialist, ideas, of, ferdinand, lassalle, in, the, interests, of, a, united, socialist, party, this, work, is, also, notable, for, another, famous, marx, quote, from, each, according, to, his, ability, to, each, according, to, his, need, in, a, letter, to, vera, zasulich, dated, 8, march, 1881, marx, contemplated, the, possibility, of, russia, s, bypassing, the, capitalist, stage, of, development, and, building, communism, on, the, basis, of, the, common, ownership, of, land, characteristic, of, the, village, mir, while, admitting, that, russia, s, rural, commune, is, the, fulcrum, of, social, regeneration, in, russia, marx, also, warned, that, in, order, for, the, mir, to, operate, as, a, means, for, moving, straight, to, the, socialist, stage, without, a, preceding, capitalist, stage, it, would, first, be, necessary, to, eliminate, the, deleterious, influences, which, are, assailing, it, from, all, sides, given, the, elimination, of, these, pernicious, influences, marx, allowed, that, normal, conditions, of, spontaneous, development, of, the, rural, commune, could, exist, however, in, the, same, letter, to, vera, zasulich, he, points, out, that, at, the, core, of, the, capitalist, system, lies, the, complete, separation, of, the, producer, from, the, means, of, production, in, one, of, the, drafts, of, this, letter, marx, reveals, his, growing, passion, for, anthropology, motivated, by, his, belief, that, future, communism, would, be, a, return, on, a, higher, level, to, the, communism, of, our, prehistoric, past, he, wrote, that, the, historical, trend, of, our, age, is, the, fatal, crisis, which, capitalist, production, has, undergone, in, the, european, and, american, countries, where, it, has, reached, its, highest, peak, a, crisis, that, will, end, in, its, destruction, in, the, return, of, modern, society, to, a, higher, form, of, the, most, archaic, type, collective, production, and, appropriation, he, added, that, the, vitality, of, primitive, communities, was, incomparably, greater, than, that, of, semitic, greek, roman, etc, societies, and, a, fortiori, that, of, modern, capitalist, societies, before, he, died, marx, asked, engels, to, write, up, these, ideas, which, were, published, in, 1884, under, the, title, the, origin, of, the, family, private, property, and, the, state, marx, and, von, westphalen, had, seven, children, together, but, partly, owing, to, the, poor, conditions, in, which, they, lived, whilst, in, london, only, three, survived, to, adulthood, their, children, were, jenny, caroline, m, longuet, 1844, 1883, jenny, laura, m, lafargue, 1845, 1911, edgar, 1847, 1855, henry, edward, guy, guido, 1849, 1850, jenny, eveline, frances, franziska, 1851, 1852, jenny, julia, eleanor, 1855, 1898, and, one, more, who, died, before, being, named, july, 1857, according, to, his, son, in, law, paul, lafargue, marx, was, a, loving, father, in, 1962, there, were, allegations, that, marx, fathered, a, son, freddy, out, of, wedlock, by, his, housekeeper, helene, demuth, but, the, claim, is, disputed, for, lack, of, documented, evidence, helene, demuth, was, also, largely, entrusted, as, a, confidante, in, her, obituary, penned, by, friedrich, engels, her, role, is, revealed, as, marx, took, counsel, of, helena, demuth, not, only, in, difficult, and, intricate, party, matters, but, even, in, respect, of, his, economical, writings, marx, frequently, used, pseudonyms, often, when, renting, a, house, or, flat, apparently, to, make, it, harder, for, the, authorities, to, track, him, down, while, in, paris, he, used, that, of, monsieur, ramboz, whilst, in, london, he, signed, off, his, letters, as, a, williams, his, friends, referred, to, him, as, moor, owing, to, his, dark, complexion, and, black, curly, hair, while, he, encouraged, his, children, to, call, him, old, nick, and, charley, he, also, bestowed, nicknames, and, pseudonyms, on, his, friends, and, family, referring, to, friedrich, engels, as, general, his, housekeeper, helene, as, lenchen, or, nym, while, one, of, his, daughters, jennychen, was, referred, to, as, qui, qui, emperor, of, china, and, another, laura, was, known, as, kakadou, or, the, hottentot, marx, drank, heavily, after, joining, the, trier, tavern, club, drinking, society, in, the, 1830s, and, continued, to, do, so, until, his, death, marx, was, afflicted, by, poor, health, what, he, himself, described, as, the, wretchedness, of, existence, and, various, authors, have, sought, to, describe, and, explain, it, his, biographer, werner, blumenberg, attributed, it, to, liver, and, gall, problems, which, marx, had, in, 1849, and, from, which, he, was, never, afterward, free, exacerbated, by, an, unsuitable, lifestyle, the, attacks, often, came, with, headaches, eye, inflammation, neuralgia, in, the, head, and, rheumatic, pains, a, serious, nervous, disorder, appeared, in, 1877, and, protracted, insomnia, was, a, consequence, which, marx, fought, with, narcotics, the, illness, was, aggravated, by, excessive, nocturnal, work, and, faulty, diet, marx, was, fond, of, highly, seasoned, dishes, smoked, fish, caviare, pickled, cucumbers, none, of, which, are, good, for, liver, patients, but, he, also, liked, wine, and, liqueurs, and, smoked, an, enormous, amount, and, since, he, had, no, money, it, was, usually, bad, quality, cigars, from, 1863, marx, complained, a, lot, about, boils, these, are, very, frequent, with, liver, patients, and, may, be, due, to, the, same, causes, the, abscesses, were, so, bad, that, marx, could, neither, sit, nor, work, upright, according, to, blumenberg, marx, s, irritability, is, often, found, in, liver, patients, the, illness, emphasised, certain, traits, in, his, character, he, argued, cuttingly, his, biting, satire, did, not, shrink, at, insults, and, his, expressions, could, be, rude, and, cruel, though, in, general, marx, had, blind, faith, in, his, closest, friends, nevertheless, he, himself, complained, that, he, was, sometimes, too, mistrustful, and, unjust, even, to, them, his, verdicts, not, only, about, enemies, but, even, about, friends, were, sometimes, so, harsh, that, even, less, sensitive, people, would, take, offence, there, must, have, been, few, whom, he, did, not, criticize, like, this, not, even, engels, was, an, exception, according, to, princeton, historian, jerrold, seigel, in, his, late, teens, marx, may, have, had, pneumonia, or, pleurisy, the, effects, of, which, led, to, his, being, exempted, from, prussian, military, service, in, later, life, whilst, working, on, das, kapital, which, he, never, completed, marx, suffered, from, a, trio, of, afflictions, a, liver, ailment, probably, hereditary, was, aggravated, by, overwork, a, bad, diet, and, lack, of, sleep, inflammation, of, the, eyes, was, induced, by, too, much, work, at, night, a, third, affliction, eruption, of, carbuncles, or, boils, was, probably, brought, on, by, general, physical, debility, to, which, the, various, features, of, marx, s, style, of, life, alcohol, tobacco, poor, diet, and, failure, to, sleep, all, contributed, engels, often, exhorted, marx, to, alter, this, dangerous, regime, in, seigel, s, thesis, what, lay, behind, this, punishing, sacrifice, of, his, health, may, have, been, guilt, about, self, involvement, and, egoism, originally, induced, in, karl, marx, by, his, father, in, 2007, a, retrodiagnosis, of, marx, s, skin, disease, was, made, by, dermatologist, sam, shuster, of, newcastle, university, and, for, shuster, the, most, probable, explanation, was, that, marx, suffered, not, from, liver, problems, but, from, hidradenitis, suppurativa, a, recurring, infective, condition, arising, from, blockage, of, apocrine, ducts, opening, into, hair, follicles, this, condition, which, was, not, described, in, the, english, medical, literature, until, 1933, hence, would, not, have, been, known, to, marx, s, physicians, can, produce, joint, pain, which, could, be, misdiagnosed, as, rheumatic, disorder, and, painful, eye, conditions, to, arrive, at, his, retrodiagnosis, shuster, considered, the, primary, material, the, marx, correspondence, published, in, the, 50, volumes, of, the, marx, engels, collected, works, there, although, the, skin, lesions, were, called, furuncles, boils, and, carbuncles, by, marx, his, wife, and, his, physicians, they, were, too, persistent, recurrent, destructive, and, site, specific, for, that, diagnosis, the, sites, of, the, persistent, carbuncles, were, noted, repeatedly, in, the, armpits, groins, perianal, genital, penis, and, scrotum, and, suprapubic, regions, and, inner, thighs, favoured, sites, of, hidradenitis, suppurativa, professor, shuster, claimed, the, diagnosis, can, now, be, made, definitively, shuster, went, on, to, consider, the, potential, psychosocial, effects, of, the, disease, noting, that, the, skin, is, an, organ, of, communication, and, that, hidradenitis, suppurativa, produces, much, psychological, distress, including, loathing, and, disgust, and, depression, of, self, image, mood, and, well, being, feelings, for, which, shuster, found, much, evidence, in, the, marx, correspondence, professor, shuster, went, on, to, ask, himself, whether, the, mental, effects, of, the, disease, affected, marx, s, work, and, even, helped, him, to, develop, his, theory, of, alienation, following, the, death, of, his, wife, jenny, in, december, 1881, marx, developed, a, catarrh, that, kept, him, in, ill, health, for, the, last, 15, months, of, his, life, it, eventually, brought, on, the, bronchitis, and, pleurisy, that, killed, him, in, london, on, 14, march, 1883, when, he, died, a, stateless, person, at, age, 64, family, and, friends, in, london, buried, his, body, in, highgate, cemetery, east, london, on, 17, march, 1883, in, an, area, reserved, for, agnostics, and, atheists, george, eliot, s, grave, is, nearby, according, to, francis, wheen, there, were, between, nine, and, eleven, mourners, at, his, funeral, however, research, from, contemporary, sources, identifies, thirteen, named, individuals, attending, the, funeral, friedrich, engels, eleanor, marx, edward, aveling, paul, lafargue, charles, longuet, helene, demuth, wilhelm, liebknecht, gottlieb, lemke, frederick, lessner, g, lochner, sir, ray, lankester, carl, schorlemmer, and, ernest, radford, a, contemporary, newspaper, account, claims, that, twenty, five, to, thirty, relatives, and, friends, attended, the, funeral, a, writer, in, the, graphic, noted, by, a, strange, blunder, his, death, was, not, announced, for, two, days, and, then, as, having, taken, place, at, paris, the, next, day, the, correction, came, from, paris, and, when, his, friends, and, followers, hastened, to, his, house, in, haverstock, hill, to, learn, the, time, and, place, of, burial, they, learned, that, he, was, already, in, the, cold, ground, but, for, this, secresy, and, haste, a, great, popular, demonstration, would, undoubtedly, have, been, held, over, his, grave, several, of, his, closest, friends, spoke, at, his, funeral, including, wilhelm, liebknecht, and, friedrich, engels, engels, speech, included, the, passage, on, the, 14th, of, march, at, a, quarter, to, three, in, the, afternoon, the, greatest, living, thinker, ceased, to, think, he, had, been, left, alone, for, scarcely, two, minutes, and, when, we, came, back, we, found, him, in, his, armchair, peacefully, gone, to, sleep, but, forever, marx, s, surviving, daughters, eleanor, and, laura, as, well, as, charles, longuet, and, paul, lafargue, marx, s, two, french, socialist, sons, in, law, were, also, in, attendance, he, had, been, predeceased, by, his, wife, and, his, eldest, daughter, the, latter, dying, a, few, months, earlier, in, january, 1883, liebknecht, a, founder, and, leader, of, the, german, social, democratic, party, gave, a, speech, in, german, and, longuet, a, prominent, figure, in, the, french, working, class, movement, made, a, short, statement, in, french, two, telegrams, from, workers, parties, in, france, and, spain, were, also, read, out, together, with, engels, s, speech, this, constituted, the, entire, programme, of, the, funeral, non, relatives, attending, the, funeral, included, three, communist, associates, of, marx, friedrich, lessner, imprisoned, for, three, years, after, the, cologne, communist, trial, of, 1852, g, lochner, whom, engels, described, as, an, old, member, of, the, communist, league, and, carl, schorlemmer, a, professor, of, chemistry, in, manchester, a, member, of, the, royal, society, and, a, communist, activist, involved, in, the, 1848, baden, revolution, another, attendee, of, the, funeral, was, ray, lankester, a, british, zoologist, who, would, later, become, a, prominent, academic, marx, left, a, personal, estate, valued, for, probate, at, 250, equivalent, to, 38, 095, in, 2024, upon, his, own, death, in, 1895, engels, left, marx, s, two, surviving, daughters, a, significant, portion, of, his, considerable, estate, valued, in, 2024, at, us, 6, 8, million, marx, and, his, family, were, reburied, on, a, new, site, nearby, in, november, 1954, the, tomb, at, the, new, site, unveiled, on, 14, march, 1956, bears, the, carved, message, workers, of, all, lands, unite, the, final, line, of, the, communist, manifesto, and, from, the, 11th, thesis, on, feuerbach, as, edited, by, engels, the, philosophers, have, only, interpreted, the, world, in, various, ways, the, point, however, is, to, change, it, the, communist, party, of, great, britain, cpgb, had, the, monument, with, a, portrait, bust, by, laurence, bradshaw, erected, and, marx, s, original, tomb, had, only, humble, adornment, black, civil, rights, leader, and, cpgb, activist, claudia, jones, was, later, buried, beside, karl, marx, s, tomb, the, marxist, historian, eric, hobsbawm, remarked, one, cannot, say, marx, died, a, failure, although, he, had, not, achieved, a, large, following, of, disciples, in, britain, his, writings, had, already, begun, to, make, an, impact, on, the, left, wing, movements, in, germany, and, russia, within, twenty, five, years, of, his, death, the, continental, european, socialist, parties, that, acknowledged, marx, s, influence, on, their, politics, had, contributed, to, significant, gains, in, their, representative, democratic, elections, marx, s, thought, demonstrates, influence, from, many, sources, including, but, not, limited, to, marx, s, view, of, history, which, came, to, be, called, historical, materialism, controversially, adapted, as, the, philosophy, of, dialectical, materialism, by, engels, and, lenin, certainly, shows, the, influence, of, hegel, s, claim, that, one, should, view, reality, and, history, dialectically, however, whereas, hegel, had, thought, in, idealist, terms, putting, ideas, in, the, forefront, marx, sought, to, conceptualise, dialectics, in, materialist, terms, arguing, for, the, primacy, of, matter, over, idea, where, hegel, saw, the, spirit, as, driving, history, marx, saw, this, as, an, unnecessary, mystification, obscuring, the, reality, of, humanity, and, its, physical, actions, shaping, the, world, he, wrote, that, hegelianism, stood, the, movement, of, reality, on, its, head, and, that, one, needed, to, set, it, upon, its, feet, despite, his, dislike, of, mystical, terms, marx, used, gothic, language, in, several, of, his, works, in, the, communist, manifesto, he, proclaims, a, spectre, is, haunting, europe, the, spectre, of, communism, all, the, powers, of, old, europe, have, entered, into, a, holy, alliance, to, exorcise, this, spectre, and, in, the, capital, he, refers, to, capital, as, necromancy, that, surrounds, the, products, of, labour, though, inspired, by, french, socialist, and, sociological, thought, marx, criticised, utopian, socialists, arguing, that, their, favoured, small, scale, socialistic, communities, would, be, bound, to, marginalisation, and, poverty, and, that, only, a, large, scale, change, in, the, economic, system, could, bring, about, real, change, other, important, contributions, to, marx, s, revision, of, hegelianism, came, from, engels, s, book, the, condition, of, the, working, class, in, england, in, 1844, which, led, marx, to, conceive, of, the, historical, dialectic, in, terms, of, class, conflict, and, to, see, the, modern, working, class, as, the, most, progressive, force, for, revolution, as, well, as, from, the, social, democrat, friedrich, wilhelm, schulz, who, in, die, bewegung, der, produktion, described, the, movement, of, society, as, flowing, from, the, contradiction, between, the, forces, of, production, and, the, mode, of, production, marx, believed, that, he, could, study, history, and, society, scientifically, discerning, tendencies, of, history, and, thereby, predicting, the, outcome, of, social, conflicts, some, followers, of, marx, therefore, concluded, that, a, communist, revolution, would, inevitably, occur, however, marx, famously, asserted, in, the, eleventh, of, his, theses, on, feuerbach, that, philosophers, have, only, interpreted, the, world, in, various, ways, the, point, however, is, to, change, it, and, he, clearly, dedicated, himself, to, trying, to, alter, the, world, marx, s, theories, inspired, several, theories, and, disciplines, of, future, including, but, not, limited, to, marx, s, polemic, with, other, thinkers, often, occurred, through, critique, and, thus, he, has, been, called, the, first, great, user, of, critical, method, in, social, sciences, he, criticised, speculative, philosophy, equating, metaphysics, with, ideology, by, adopting, this, approach, marx, attempted, to, separate, key, findings, from, ideological, biases, this, set, him, apart, from, many, contemporary, philosophers, like, tocqueville, who, described, a, faceless, and, bureaucratic, despotism, with, no, identifiable, despot, marx, also, broke, with, classical, thinkers, who, spoke, of, a, single, tyrant, and, with, montesquieu, who, discussed, the, nature, of, the, single, despot, instead, marx, set, out, to, analyse, the, despotism, of, capital, fundamentally, marx, assumed, that, human, history, involves, transforming, human, nature, which, encompasses, both, human, beings, and, material, objects, humans, recognise, that, they, possess, both, actual, and, potential, selves, for, both, marx, and, hegel, self, development, begins, with, an, experience, of, internal, alienation, stemming, from, this, recognition, followed, by, a, realisation, that, the, actual, self, as, a, subjective, agent, renders, its, potential, counterpart, an, object, to, be, apprehended, marx, further, argues, that, by, moulding, nature, in, desired, ways, the, subject, takes, the, object, as, its, own, and, thus, permits, the, individual, to, be, actualised, as, fully, human, for, marx, the, human, nature, gattungswesen, or, species, being, exists, as, a, function, of, human, labour, fundamental, to, marx, s, idea, of, meaningful, labour, is, the, proposition, that, for, a, subject, to, come, to, terms, with, its, alienated, object, it, must, first, exert, influence, upon, literal, material, objects, in, the, subject, s, world, marx, acknowledges, that, hegel, grasps, the, nature, of, work, and, comprehends, objective, man, authentic, because, actual, as, the, result, of, his, own, work, but, characterises, hegelian, self, development, as, unduly, spiritual, and, abstract, marx, thus, departs, from, hegel, by, insisting, that, the, fact, that, man, is, a, corporeal, actual, sentient, objective, being, with, natural, capacities, means, that, he, has, actual, sensuous, objects, for, his, nature, as, objects, of, his, life, expression, or, that, he, can, only, express, his, life, in, actual, sensuous, objects, consequently, marx, revises, hegelian, work, into, material, labour, and, in, the, context, of, human, capacity, to, transform, nature, the, term, labour, power, the, history, of, all, hitherto, existing, society, is, the, history, of, class, struggles, marx, had, a, special, concern, with, how, people, relate, to, their, own, labour, power, he, wrote, extensively, about, this, in, terms, of, the, problem, of, alienation, as, with, the, dialectic, marx, began, with, a, hegelian, notion, of, alienation, but, developed, a, more, materialist, conception, capitalism, mediates, social, relationships, of, production, such, as, among, workers, or, between, workers, and, capitalists, through, commodities, including, labour, that, are, bought, and, sold, on, the, market, for, marx, the, possibility, that, one, may, give, up, ownership, of, one, s, own, labour, one, s, capacity, to, transform, the, world, is, tantamount, to, being, alienated, from, one, s, own, nature, and, it, is, a, spiritual, loss, marx, described, this, loss, as, commodity, fetishism, in, which, the, things, that, people, produce, commodities, appear, to, have, a, life, and, movement, of, their, own, to, which, humans, and, their, behaviour, merely, adapt, commodity, fetishism, provides, an, example, of, what, engels, called, false, consciousness, which, relates, closely, to, the, understanding, of, ideology, by, ideology, marx, and, engels, meant, ideas, that, reflect, the, interests, of, a, particular, class, at, a, particular, time, in, history, but, which, contemporaries, see, as, universal, and, eternal, marx, and, engels, s, point, was, not, only, that, such, beliefs, are, at, best, half, truths, as, they, serve, an, important, political, function, put, another, way, the, control, that, one, class, exercises, over, the, means, of, production, include, not, only, the, production, of, food, or, manufactured, goods, but, also, the, production, of, ideas, this, provides, one, possible, explanation, for, why, members, of, a, subordinate, class, may, hold, ideas, contrary, to, their, own, interests, an, example, of, this, sort, of, analysis, is, marx, s, understanding, of, religion, summed, up, in, a, passage, from, the, preface, to, his, 1843, contribution, to, the, critique, of, hegel, s, philosophy, of, right, religious, suffering, is, at, one, and, the, same, time, the, expression, of, real, suffering, and, a, protest, against, real, suffering, religion, is, the, sigh, of, the, oppressed, creature, the, heart, of, a, heartless, world, and, the, soul, of, soulless, conditions, it, is, the, opium, of, the, people, the, abolition, of, religion, as, the, illusory, happiness, of, the, people, is, the, demand, for, their, real, happiness, to, call, on, them, to, give, up, their, illusions, about, their, condition, is, to, call, on, them, to, give, up, a, condition, that, requires, illusions, whereas, his, gymnasium, senior, thesis, at, the, gymnasium, zu, trier, argued, that, religion, had, as, its, primary, social, aim, the, promotion, of, solidarity, here, marx, sees, the, social, function, of, religion, in, terms, of, highlighting, preserving, political, and, economic, status, quo, and, inequality, marx, was, an, outspoken, opponent, of, child, labour, saying, that, british, industries, could, but, live, by, sucking, blood, and, children, s, blood, too, and, that, u, s, capital, was, financed, by, the, capitalized, blood, of, children, but, you, communists, would, introduce, community, of, women, screams, the, whole, bourgeoisie, in, chorus, the, bourgeois, sees, in, his, wife, a, mere, instrument, of, production, he, hears, that, the, means, of, production, are, to, be, exploited, in, common, and, naturally, can, come, to, no, other, conclusion, than, that, the, lot, of, being, common, to, all, will, likewise, fall, to, the, women, he, has, not, even, a, suspicion, that, the, real, point, aimed, at, is, to, do, away, with, the, status, of, women, as, mere, mean, of, production, karl, marx, the, communist, manifesto, marx, s, thoughts, on, labour, and, its, function, in, reproducing, capital, were, related, to, the, primacy, he, gave, to, social, relations, in, determining, the, society, s, past, present, and, future, critics, have, called, this, economic, determinism, labour, is, the, precondition, for, the, existence, of, and, accumulation, of, capital, which, both, shape, the, social, system, for, marx, social, change, was, driven, by, conflict, between, opposing, interests, by, parties, situated, in, the, historical, situation, of, their, mode, of, production, this, became, the, inspiration, for, the, body, of, works, known, as, the, conflict, theory, in, his, evolutionary, model, of, history, he, argued, that, human, history, began, with, free, productive, and, creative, activities, that, was, over, time, coerced, and, dehumanised, a, trend, most, apparent, under, capitalism, marx, noted, that, this, was, not, an, intentional, process, but, rather, due, to, the, immanent, logic, of, the, current, mode, of, production, which, demands, more, human, labour, abstract, labour, to, reproduce, the, social, relationships, of, capital, the, organisation, of, society, depends, on, means, of, production, the, means, of, production, are, all, things, required, to, produce, material, goods, such, as, land, natural, resources, and, technology, but, not, human, labour, the, relations, of, production, are, the, social, relationships, people, enter, into, as, they, acquire, and, use, the, means, of, production, together, these, compose, the, mode, of, production, and, marx, distinguished, historical, eras, in, terms, of, modes, of, production, marx, differentiated, between, base, and, superstructure, where, the, base, or, substructure, is, the, economic, system, and, superstructure, is, the, cultural, and, political, system, marx, regarded, this, mismatch, between, economic, base, and, social, superstructure, as, a, major, source, of, social, disruption, and, conflict, despite, marx, s, stress, on, the, critique, of, capitalism, and, discussion, of, the, new, communist, society, that, should, replace, it, his, explicit, critique, is, guarded, as, he, saw, it, as, an, improved, society, compared, to, the, past, ones, slavery, and, feudalism, marx, never, clearly, discusses, issues, of, morality, and, justice, but, scholars, agree, that, his, work, contained, implicit, discussion, of, those, concepts, marx, s, view, of, capitalism, was, two, sided, on, one, hand, in, the, 19th, century, s, deepest, critique, of, the, dehumanising, aspects, of, this, system, he, noted, that, defining, features, of, capitalism, include, alienation, exploitation, and, recurring, cyclical, depressions, leading, to, mass, unemployment, on, the, other, hand, he, characterised, capitalism, as, revolutionising, industrialising, and, universalising, qualities, of, development, growth, and, progressivity, by, which, marx, meant, industrialisation, urbanisation, technological, progress, increased, productivity, and, growth, rationality, and, scientific, revolution, that, are, responsible, for, progress, at, in, contrast, to, earlier, forms, of, societies, marx, considered, the, capitalist, class, to, be, one, of, the, most, revolutionary, in, history, because, it, constantly, improved, the, means, of, production, more, so, than, any, other, class, in, history, and, was, responsible, for, the, overthrow, of, feudalism, capitalism, can, stimulate, considerable, growth, because, the, capitalist, has, an, incentive, to, reinvest, profits, in, new, technologies, and, capital, equipment, according, to, marx, capitalists, take, advantage, of, the, difference, between, the, labour, market, and, the, market, for, whatever, commodity, the, capitalist, can, produce, marx, observed, that, in, practically, every, successful, industry, input, unit, costs, are, lower, than, output, unit, prices, marx, called, the, difference, surplus, value, and, argued, that, it, was, based, on, surplus, labour, the, difference, between, what, it, costs, to, keep, workers, alive, and, what, they, can, produce, although, marx, describes, capitalists, as, vampires, sucking, worker, s, blood, he, notes, that, drawing, profit, is, by, no, means, an, injustice, since, marx, according, to, allen, w, wood, excludes, any, trans, epochal, standpoint, from, which, one, can, comment, on, the, morals, of, such, particular, arrangements, marx, also, noted, that, even, the, capitalists, themselves, cannot, go, against, the, system, the, problem, is, the, cancerous, cell, of, capital, understood, not, as, property, or, equipment, but, the, social, relations, between, workers, and, owners, the, selling, and, purchasing, of, labour, power, the, societal, system, or, rather, mode, of, production, in, general, at, the, same, time, marx, stressed, that, capitalism, was, unstable, and, prone, to, periodic, crises, he, suggested, that, over, time, capitalists, would, invest, more, and, more, in, new, technologies, and, less, and, less, in, labour, since, marx, believed, that, profit, derived, from, surplus, value, appropriated, from, labour, he, concluded, that, the, rate, of, profit, would, fall, as, the, economy, grows, marx, believed, that, increasingly, severe, crises, would, punctuate, this, cycle, of, growth, and, collapse, moreover, he, believed, that, in, the, long, term, this, process, would, enrich, and, empower, the, capitalist, class, and, impoverish, the, proletariat, in, section, one, of, the, communist, manifesto, marx, describes, feudalism, capitalism, and, the, role, internal, social, contradictions, play, in, the, historical, process, we, see, then, the, means, of, production, and, of, exchange, on, whose, foundation, the, bourgeoisie, built, itself, up, were, generated, in, feudal, society, at, a, certain, stage, in, the, development, of, these, means, of, production, and, of, exchange, the, conditions, under, which, feudal, society, produced, and, exchanged, the, feudal, relations, of, property, became, no, longer, compatible, with, the, already, developed, productive, forces, they, became, so, many, fetters, they, had, to, be, burst, asunder, they, were, burst, asunder, into, their, place, stepped, free, competition, accompanied, by, a, social, and, political, constitution, adapted, in, it, and, the, economic, and, political, sway, of, the, bourgeois, class, a, similar, movement, is, going, on, before, our, own, eyes, the, productive, forces, at, the, disposal, of, society, no, longer, tend, to, further, the, development, of, the, conditions, of, bourgeois, property, on, the, contrary, they, have, become, too, powerful, for, these, conditions, by, which, they, are, fettered, and, so, soon, as, they, overcome, these, fetters, they, bring, order, into, the, whole, of, bourgeois, society, endanger, the, existence, of, bourgeois, property, marx, believed, that, those, structural, contradictions, within, capitalism, necessitate, its, end, giving, way, to, socialism, or, a, post, capitalistic, communist, society, the, development, of, modern, industry, therefore, cuts, from, under, its, feet, the, very, foundation, on, which, the, bourgeoisie, produces, and, appropriates, products, what, the, bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above, all, are, its, own, grave, diggers, its, fall, and, the, victory, of, the, proletariat, are, equally, inevitable, thanks, to, various, processes, overseen, by, capitalism, such, as, urbanisation, the, working, class, the, proletariat, should, grow, in, numbers, and, develop, class, consciousness, in, time, realising, that, they, can, and, must, change, the, system, marx, believed, that, if, the, proletariat, were, to, seize, the, means, of, production, they, would, encourage, social, relations, that, would, benefit, everyone, equally, abolishing, the, exploiting, class, and, introducing, a, system, of, production, less, vulnerable, to, cyclical, crises, marx, argued, in, the, german, ideology, that, capitalism, will, end, through, the, organised, actions, of, an, international, working, class, communism, is, for, us, not, a, state, of, affairs, which, is, to, be, established, an, ideal, to, which, reality, will, have, to, adjust, itself, we, call, communism, the, real, movement, which, abolishes, the, present, state, of, things, the, conditions, of, this, movement, result, from, the, premises, now, in, existence, in, this, new, society, the, alienation, would, end, and, humans, would, be, free, to, act, without, being, bound, by, selling, their, labour, it, would, be, a, democratic, society, enfranchising, the, entire, population, in, such, a, utopian, world, there, would, also, be, little, need, for, a, state, whose, goal, was, previously, to, enforce, the, alienation, marx, theorised, that, between, capitalism, and, the, establishment, of, a, socialist, communist, system, would, exist, a, period, of, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, where, the, working, class, holds, political, power, and, forcibly, socialises, the, means, of, production, as, he, wrote, in, his, critique, of, the, gotha, program, between, capitalist, and, communist, society, there, lies, the, period, of, the, revolutionary, transformation, of, the, one, into, the, other, corresponding, to, this, is, also, a, political, transition, period, in, which, the, state, can, be, nothing, but, the, revolutionary, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, while, he, allowed, for, the, possibility, of, peaceful, transition, in, some, countries, with, strong, democratic, institutional, structures, such, as, britain, the, united, states, and, the, netherlands, he, suggested, that, in, other, countries, in, which, workers, cannot, attain, their, goal, by, peaceful, means, the, lever, of, our, revolution, must, be, force, marx, viewed, russia, as, the, main, counter, revolutionary, threat, to, european, revolutions, during, the, crimean, war, marx, backed, the, ottoman, empire, and, its, allies, britain, and, france, against, russia, he, was, absolutely, opposed, to, pan, slavism, viewing, it, as, an, instrument, of, russian, foreign, policy, marx, had, considered, the, slavic, nations, except, poles, as, counter, revolutionary, marx, and, engels, published, in, the, neue, rheinische, zeitung, in, february, 1849, to, the, sentimental, phrases, about, brotherhood, which, we, are, being, offered, here, on, behalf, of, the, most, counter, revolutionary, nations, of, europe, we, reply, that, hatred, of, russians, was, and, still, is, the, primary, revolutionary, passion, among, germans, that, since, the, revolution, hatred, of, czechs, and, croats, has, been, added, and, that, only, by, the, most, determined, use, of, terror, against, these, slav, peoples, can, we, jointly, with, the, poles, and, magyars, safeguard, the, revolution, we, know, where, the, enemies, of, the, revolution, are, concentrated, viz, in, russia, and, the, slav, regions, of, austria, and, no, fine, phrases, no, allusions, to, an, undefined, democratic, future, for, these, countries, can, deter, us, from, treating, our, enemies, as, enemies, then, there, will, be, a, struggle, an, inexorable, life, and, death, struggle, against, those, slavs, who, betray, the, revolution, an, annihilating, fight, and, ruthless, terror, not, in, the, interests, of, germany, but, in, the, interests, of, the, revolution, marx, and, engels, sympathised, with, the, narodnik, revolutionaries, of, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, when, the, russian, revolutionaries, assassinated, tsar, alexander, ii, of, russia, marx, expressed, the, hope, that, the, assassination, foreshadowed, the, formation, of, a, russian, commune, marx, supported, the, polish, uprisings, against, tsarist, russia, he, said, in, a, speech, in, london, in, 1867, in, the, first, place, the, policy, of, russia, is, changeless, its, methods, its, tactics, its, manoeuvres, may, change, but, the, polar, star, of, its, policy, world, domination, is, a, fixed, star, in, our, times, only, a, civilised, government, ruling, over, barbarian, masses, can, hatch, out, such, a, plan, and, execute, it, there, is, but, one, alternative, for, europe, either, asiatic, barbarism, under, muscovite, direction, will, burst, around, its, head, like, an, avalanche, or, else, it, must, re, establish, poland, thus, putting, twenty, million, heroes, between, itself, and, asia, and, gaining, a, breathing, spell, for, the, accomplishment, of, its, social, regeneration, marx, supported, the, cause, of, irish, independence, in, 1867, he, wrote, engels, i, used, to, think, the, separation, of, ireland, from, england, impossible, i, now, think, it, inevitable, the, english, working, class, will, never, accomplish, anything, until, it, has, got, rid, of, ireland, english, reaction, in, england, had, its, roots, in, the, subjugation, of, ireland, marx, spent, some, time, in, french, algeria, which, had, been, invaded, and, made, a, french, colony, in, 1830, and, had, the, opportunity, to, observe, life, in, colonial, north, africa, he, wrote, about, the, colonial, justice, system, in, which, a, form, of, torture, has, been, used, and, this, happens, regularly, to, extract, confessions, from, the, arabs, naturally, it, is, done, like, the, english, in, india, by, the, police, the, judge, is, supposed, to, know, nothing, at, all, about, it, marx, was, surprised, by, the, arrogance, of, many, european, settlers, in, algiers, and, wrote, in, a, letter, when, a, european, colonist, dwells, among, the, lesser, breeds, either, as, a, settler, or, even, on, business, he, generally, regards, himself, as, even, more, inviolable, than, handsome, william, i, still, when, it, comes, to, bare, faced, arrogance, and, presumptuousness, vis, vis, the, lesser, breeds, the, british, and, dutch, outdo, the, french, according, to, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, marx, s, analysis, of, colonialism, as, a, progressive, force, bringing, modernization, to, a, backward, feudal, society, sounds, like, a, transparent, rationalization, for, foreign, domination, his, account, of, british, domination, however, reflects, the, same, ambivalence, that, he, shows, towards, capitalism, in, europe, in, both, cases, marx, recognizes, the, immense, suffering, brought, about, during, the, transition, from, feudal, to, bourgeois, society, while, insisting, that, the, transition, is, both, necessary, and, ultimately, progressive, he, argues, that, the, penetration, of, foreign, commerce, will, cause, a, social, revolution, in, india, marx, discussed, british, colonial, rule, in, india, in, the, new, york, herald, tribune, in, june, 1853, there, cannot, remain, any, doubt, but, that, the, misery, inflicted, by, the, british, on, hindostan, is, of, an, essentially, different, and, infinitely, more, intensive, kind, than, all, hindostan, had, to, suffer, before, england, has, broken, down, the, entire, framework, of, indian, society, without, any, symptoms, of, reconstitution, yet, appearing, we, must, not, forget, that, these, idyllic, village, communities, inoffensive, though, they, may, appear, had, always, been, the, solid, foundation, of, oriental, despotism, that, they, restrained, the, human, mind, within, the, smallest, possible, compass, making, it, the, unresisting, tool, of, superstition, marx, s, ideas, have, had, a, profound, impact, on, world, politics, and, intellectual, thought, in, particular, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 1917, russian, revolution, followers, of, marx, have, often, debated, among, themselves, over, how, to, interpret, marx, s, writings, and, apply, his, concepts, to, the, modern, world, the, legacy, of, marx, s, thought, has, become, contested, between, numerous, tendencies, each, of, which, sees, itself, as, marx, s, most, accurate, interpreter, in, the, political, realm, these, tendencies, include, political, theories, such, as, leninism, marxism, leninism, trotskyism, maoism, luxemburgism, libertarian, marxism, and, open, marxism, various, currents, have, also, developed, in, academic, marxism, often, under, influence, of, other, views, resulting, in, structuralist, marxism, historical, materialism, phenomenological, marxism, analytical, marxism, and, hegelian, marxism, from, an, academic, perspective, marx, s, work, contributed, to, the, birth, of, modern, sociology, he, has, been, cited, as, one, of, the, 19th, century, s, three, masters, of, the, school, of, suspicion, alongside, friedrich, nietzsche, and, sigmund, freud, and, as, one, of, the, three, principal, architects, of, modern, social, science, along, with, mile, durkheim, and, max, weber, in, contrast, to, other, philosophers, marx, offered, theories, that, could, often, be, tested, with, the, scientific, method, both, marx, and, auguste, comte, set, out, to, develop, scientifically, justified, ideologies, in, the, wake, of, european, secularisation, and, new, developments, in, the, philosophies, of, history, and, science, working, in, the, hegelian, tradition, marx, rejected, comtean, sociological, positivism, in, an, attempt, to, develop, a, science, of, society, karl, l, with, considered, marx, and, s, ren, kierkegaard, to, be, the, two, greatest, philosophical, successors, of, hegel, in, modern, sociological, theory, marxist, sociology, is, recognised, as, one, of, the, main, classical, perspectives, isaiah, berlin, considers, marx, the, true, founder, of, modern, sociology, in, so, far, as, anyone, can, claim, the, title, beyond, social, science, he, has, also, had, a, lasting, legacy, in, philosophy, literature, the, arts, and, the, humanities, social, theorists, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, have, pursued, two, main, strategies, in, response, to, marx, one, move, has, been, to, reduce, it, to, its, analytical, core, known, as, analytical, marxism, another, more, common, move, has, been, to, dilute, the, explanatory, claims, of, marx, s, social, theory, and, emphasise, the, relative, autonomyworking, class, agenda, of, aspects, of, social, and, economic, life, not, directly, related, to, marx, s, central, narrative, of, interaction, between, the, development, of, the, forces, of, production, and, the, succession, of, modes, of, production, this, has, been, the, neo, marxist, theorising, adopted, by, historians, inspired, by, marx, s, social, theory, such, as, e, p, thompson, and, eric, hobsbawm, it, has, also, been, a, line, of, thinking, pursued, by, thinkers, and, activists, such, as, antonio, gramsci, who, have, sought, to, understand, the, opportunities, and, the, difficulties, of, transformative, political, practice, seen, in, the, light, of, marxist, social, theory, marx, s, ideas, would, also, have, a, profound, influence, on, subsequent, artists, and, art, history, with, avant, garde, movements, across, literature, visual, art, music, film, and, theatre, politically, marx, s, legacy, is, more, complex, throughout, the, 20th, century, revolutions, in, dozens, of, countries, labelled, themselves, marxist, most, notably, the, russian, revolution, which, led, to, the, founding, of, the, soviet, union, major, world, leaders, including, vladimir, lenin, mao, zedong, fidel, castro, salvador, allende, josip, broz, tito, kwame, nkrumah, jawaharlal, nehru, nelson, mandela, xi, jinping, and, thomas, sankara, have, all, cited, marx, as, an, influence, beyond, where, marxist, revolutions, took, place, marx, s, ideas, have, informed, political, parties, worldwide, in, countries, associated, with, marxism, some, events, have, led, political, opponents, to, blame, marx, for, millions, of, deaths, while, others, argue, for, a, distinction, between, the, legacy, and, influence, of, marx, specifically, and, the, legacy, and, influence, of, those, who, have, shaped, his, ideas, for, political, purposes, arthur, lipow, describes, marx, and, his, collaborator, friedrich, engels, as, the, founders, of, modern, revolutionary, democratic, socialism, the, cities, of, marks, russia, and, karl, marx, stadt, germany, now, known, as, chemnitz, were, named, after, marx, in, may, 2018, to, mark, the, bicentenary, of, his, birth, a, 4, 5m, statue, of, him, by, leading, chinese, sculptor, wu, weishan, and, donated, by, the, chinese, government, was, unveiled, in, his, birthplace, of, trier, germany, the, then, european, commission, president, jean, claude, juncker, defended, marx, s, memory, saying, that, today, marx, stands, for, things, which, he, is, not, responsible, for, and, which, he, didn, t, cause, because, many, of, the, things, he, wrote, down, were, redrafted, into, the, opposite, in, 2017, a, feature, film, titled, the, young, karl, marx, featuring, marx, his, wife, jenny, marx, and, engels, among, other, revolutionaries, and, intellectuals, prior, to, the, revolutions, of, 1848, received, good, reviews, for, both, its, historical, accuracy, and, its, brio, in, dealing, with, intellectual, life
