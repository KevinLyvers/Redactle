the, dark, ginsberg, and, light, cassady, side, of, their, new, vision, a, perception, stemming, partly, from, ginsberg, s, association, with, communism, of, which, kerouac, had, become, increasingly, distrustful, though, ginsberg, was, never, a, member, of, the, communist, party, kerouac, named, him, carlo, marx, in, on, the, road, this, was, a, source, of, strain, in, their, relationship, also,

more, struck, by, reading, corso, s, poems, realizing, corso, was, spiritually, gifted, ginsberg, introduced, corso, to, the, rest, of, his, inner, circle, in, their, first, meeting, at, the, pony, stable, corso, showed, ginsberg, a, poem, about, a, woman, who, lived, across, the, street, from, him, and, sunbathed, naked, in, the, window, amazingly, the, woman, happened, to, be, ginsberg, s, girlfriend, that, he, was, living, with, during, one, of, his, forays, into, heterosexuality, ginsberg, took, corso, over, to, their, apartment, there, the, woman, proposed, sex, with, corso, who,

poetry, of, ezra, pound, and, t, s, eliot, when, she, met, joyce, johnson, and, leo, skir, among, other, beat, players, as, cowen, had, felt, a, strong, attraction, to, darker, poetry, most, of, the, time, beat, poetry, seemed, to, provide, an, allure, to, what, suggests, a, shadowy, side, of, her, persona, while, at, barnard, cowen, earned, the, nickname, beat, alice, as, she, had, joined, a, small, group, of, anti, establishment, artists, and, visionaries, known, to, outsiders, as, beatniks, and, one, of, her, first, acquaintances, at, the, college, was, the, beat, poet, joyce, johnson, who, later, portrayed, cowen, in, her, books, including, minor, characters, and, come, and, join, the, dance, which, expressed, the, two, women, s, experiences, in, the, barnard, and, columbia, beat, community, through, his, association, with, elise, cowen, ginsberg, discovered, that, they, shared, a, mutual, friend, carl, solomon, to, whom, he, later, dedicated, his, most, famous, poem, howl, this, poem, is, considered, an, autobiography, of, ginsberg, up, to, 1955, and, a, brief, history, of, the, beat, generation, through, its, references, to, his, relationship, to, other, beat, artists, of, that, time, in, 1948, in, an, apartment, in, east, harlem, ginsberg, experienced, an, auditory, hallucination, while, masturbating, and, reading, the, poetry, of, william, blake, which, he, later, referred, to, as, his, blake, vision, ginsberg, claimed, to, have, heard, the, voice, of, god, also, described, as, the, voice, of, the, ancient, of, days, or, of, blake, himself, reading, ah, sun, flower, the, sick, rose, and, the, little, girl, lost, the, experience, lasted, several, days, with, him, believing, that, he, had, witnessed, the, interconnectedness, of, the, universe, ginsberg, recounted, that, after, looking, at, latticework, on, the, fire, escape, of, the, apartment, and, then, at, the, sky, he, intuited, that, one, had, been, crafted, by, human, beings, while, the, other, had, been, crafted, by, itself, he, explained, that, this, hallucination, was, not, inspired, by, drug, use, but, said, he, sought, to, recapture, the, feeling, of, interconnectedness, later, with, various, drugs, ginsberg, moved, to, san, francisco, during, the, 1950s, before, howl, and, other, poems, was, published, in, 1956, by, city, lights, he, worked, as, a, market, researcher, in, 1954, in, san, francisco, ginsberg, met, peter, orlovsky, 1933, 2010, with, whom, he, fell, in, love, and, who, remained, his, lifelong, partner, selections, from, their, correspondence, have, been, published, also, in, san, francisco, ginsberg, met, members, of, the, san, francisco, renaissance, james, broughton, robert, duncan, madeline, gleason, and, kenneth, rexroth, and, other, poets, who,

figurehead, kenneth, rexroth, who, then, introduced, ginsberg, into, the, san, francisco, poetry, scene, there, ginsberg, also, met, three, budding, poets, and, zen, enthusiasts, who, had, become, friends, at, reed, college, gary, snyder, philip, whalen, and, lew, welch, in, 1959, along, with, poets, john, kelly, bob, kaufman, a, d, winans, and, william, margolis, ginsberg, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, beatitude, poetry, magazine, wally, hedrick, a, painter, and, co, founder, of, the, six, gallery, approached, ginsberg, in, mid, 1955, and, asked, him, to, organize, a, poetry, reading, at, the, six, gallery, at, first, ginsberg, refused, but, once, he, had, written, a, rough, draft, of, howl, he, changed, his, fucking, mind, as, he, put, it, ginsberg, advertised, the, event, as, six, poets, at, the, six, gallery, one, of, the, most, important, events, in, beat, mythos, known, simply, as, the, six, gallery, reading, took, place, on, october, 7, 1955, the, event, in, essence, brought, together, the, east, and, west, coast, factions, of, the, beat, generation, of, more, personal, significance, to, ginsberg, the, reading, that, night, included, the, first, public, presentation, of, howl, a, poem, that, brought, worldwide, fame, to, ginsberg, and, to, many, of, the, poets, associated, with, him, an, account, of, that, night, can, be, found, in, kerouac, s, novel, the, dharma, bums, describing, how, change, was, collected, from, audience, members, to, buy, jugs, of, wine, and, ginsberg, reading, passionately, drunken, with, arms, outstretched, ginsberg, s, principal, work, howl, is, well, known, for, its, opening, line, i, saw, the, best, minds, of, my, generation, destroyed, by, madness, starving, hysterical, naked, howl, was, considered, scandalous, at, the, time, of, its, publication, because, of, the, rawness, of, its, language, shortly, after, its, 1956, publication, by, san, francisco, s, city, lights, bookstore, it, was, banned, for, obscenity, the, ban, became, a, cause, c, l, bre, among, defenders, of, the, first, amendment, and, was, later, lifted, after, judge, clayton, w, horn, declared, the, poem, to, possess, redeeming, artistic, value, ginsberg, and, shig, murao, the, city, lights, manager, who, was, jailed, for, selling, howl, became, lifelong, friends, ginsberg, claimed, at, one, point, that, all, of, his, work, was, an, extended, biography, like, kerouac, s, duluoz, legend, howl, is, not, only, a, biography, of, ginsberg, s, experiences, before, 1955, but, also, a, history, of, the, beat, generation, ginsberg, also, later, claimed, that, at, the, core, of, howl, were, his, unresolved, emotions, about, his, schizophrenic, mother, though, kaddish, deals, more, explicitly, with, his, mother, howl, in, many, ways, is, driven, by, the, same, emotions, howl, chronicles, the, development, of, many, important, friendships, throughout, ginsberg, s, life, he, begins, the, poem, with, i, saw, the, best, minds, of, my, generation, destroyed, by, madness, which, sets, the, stage, for, ginsberg, to, describe, cassady, and, solomon, immortalizing, them, into, american, literature, this, madness, was, the, angry, fix, that, society, needed, to, function, madness, was, its, disease, in, the, poem, ginsberg, focused, on, carl, solomon, i, m, with, you, in, rockland, and, thus, turned, solomon, into, an, archetypal, figure, searching, for, freedom, from, his, straightjacket, though, references, in, most, of, his, poetry, reveal, much, about, his, biography, his, relationship, to, other, members, of, the, beat, generation, and, his, own, political, views, howl, his, most, famous, poem, is, still, perhaps, the, best, place, to, start, in, 1957, ginsberg, surprised, the, literary, world, by, abandoning, san, francisco, after, a, spell, in, morocco, he, and, peter, orlovsky, joined, gregory, corso, in, paris, corso, introduced, them, to, a, shabby, lodging, house, above, a, bar, at, 9, rue, g, t, le, c, ur, that, was, to, become, known, as, the, beat, hotel, they, were, soon, joined, by, burroughs, and, others, it, was, a, productive, creative, time, for, all, of, them, there, ginsberg, began, his, epic, poem, kaddish, corso, composed, bomb, and, marriage, and, burroughs, with, help, from, ginsberg, and, corso, put, together, naked, lunch, from, previous, writings, this, period, was, documented, by, the, photographer, harold, chapman, who, moved, in, at, about, the, same, time, and, took, pictures, constantly, of, the, residents, of, the, hotel, until, it, closed, in, 1963, during, 1962, 1963, ginsberg, and, orlovsky, travelled, extensively, across, india, living, half, a, year, at, a, time, in, calcutta, now, kolkata, and, benares, varanasi, on, his, road, to, india, he, stayed, two, months, in, athens, august, 29, 1961, october, 31, 1961, where, he, visited, various, cites, such, as, delphi, mycines, crete, and, then, he, continued, his, journey, to, israel, kenya, and, finally, india, also, during, this, time, he, formed, friendships, with, some, of, the, prominent, young, bengali, poets, of, the, time, including, shakti, chattopadhyay, and, sunil, gangopadhyay, ginsberg, had, several, political, connections, in, india, most, notably, pupul, jayakar, who, helped, him, extend, his, stay, in, india, when, the, authorities, were, eager, to, expel, him, in, may, 1965, ginsberg, arrived, in, london, and, offered, to, read, anywhere, for, free, shortly, after, his, arrival, he, gave, a, reading, at, better, books, which, was, described, by, jeff, nuttall, as, the, first, healing, wind, on, a, very, parched, collective, mind, tom, mcgrath, wrote, this, could, well, turn, out, to, have, been, a, very, significant, moment, in, the, history, of, england, or, at, least, in, the, history, of, english, poetry, soon, after, the, bookshop, reading, plans, were, hatched, for, the, international, poetry, incarnation, which, was, held, at, the, royal, albert, hall, in, london, on, june, 11, 1965, the, event, attracted, an, audience, of, 7, 000, who, heard, readings, and, live, and, tape, performances, by, a, wide, variety, of, figures, including, ginsberg, adrian, mitchell, alexander, trocchi, harry, fainlight, anselm, hollo, christopher, logue, george, macbeth, gregory, corso, lawrence, ferlinghetti, michael, horovitz, simon, vinkenoog, spike, hawkins, and, tom, mcgrath, the, event, was, organized, by, ginsberg, s, friend, the, filmmaker, barbara, rubin, peter, whitehead, documented, the, event, on, film, and, released, it, as, wholly, communion, a, book, featuring, images, from, the, film, and, some, of, the, poems, that, were, performed, was, also, published, under, the, same, title, by, lorrimer, in, the, uk, and, grove, press, in, us, though, the, term, beat, is, most, accurately, applied, to, ginsberg, and, his, closest, friends, corso, orlovsky, kerouac, burroughs, etc, the, term, beat, generation, has, become, associated, with, many, of, the, other, poets, ginsberg, met, and, became, friends, with, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, a, key, feature, of, this, term, seems, to, be, a, friendship, with, ginsberg, friendship, with, kerouac, or, burroughs, might, also, apply, but, both, writers, later, strove, to, disassociate, themselves, from, the, name, beat, generation, part, of, their, dissatisfaction, with, the, term, came, from, the, mistaken, identification, of, ginsberg, as, the, leader, ginsberg, never, claimed, to, be, the, leader, of, a, movement, he, claimed, that, many, of, the, writers, with, whom, he, had, become, friends, in, this, period, shared, many, of, the, same, intentions, and, themes, some, of, these, friends, include, david, amram, bob, kaufman, diane, di, prima, jim, cohn, poets, associated, with, the, black, mountain, college, such, as, charles, olson, robert, creeley, and, denise, levertov, poets, associated, with, the, new, york, school, such, as, frank, o, hara, and, kenneth, koch, leroi, jones, before, he, became, amiri, baraka, who, after, reading, howl, wrote, a, letter, to, ginsberg, on, a, sheet, of, toilet, paper, baraka, s, independent, publishing, house, totem, press, published, ginsberg, s, early, work, through, a, party, organized, by, baraka, ginsberg, was, introduced, to, langston, hughes, while, ornette, coleman, played, saxophone, later, in, his, life, ginsberg, formed, a, bridge, between, the, beat, movement, of, the, 1950s, and, the, hippies, of, the, 1960s, befriending, among, others, timothy, leary, ken, kesey, hunter, s, thompson, and, bob, dylan, ginsberg, gave, his, last, public, reading, at, booksmith, a, bookstore, in, the, haight, ashbury, neighborhood, of,

publisher, was, brought, up, on, charges, for, publishing, pornography, and, the, outcome, led, to, a, judge, going, on, record, dismissing, charges, because, the, poem, carried, redeeming, social,

ginsberg, wrote, many, essays, and, articles, researching, and, compiling, evidence, of, the, cia, s, alleged, involvement, in, drug, trafficking, but, it, took, ten, years, and, the, publication, of,

written, in, formal, rhyme, and, meter, like, that, of, his, father, and, of, his, idol, william, blake, his, admiration, for, the, writing, of, jack, kerouac, inspired, him, to, take, poetry, more, seriously, in, 1955, upon, the, advice, of, a, psychiatrist, ginsberg, dropped, out, of, the, working, world, to, devote, his, entire, life, to, poetry, soon, after, he, wrote, howl, the, poem, that, brought, him, and, his, beat, generation, contemporaries, to, national, attention, and, allowed, him, to, live, as, a, professional, poet, for, the, rest, of, his, life, later, in, life, ginsberg, entered, academia, teaching, poetry, as, distinguished, professor, of, english, at, brooklyn, college, from, 1986, until, his, death, ginsberg, claimed, throughout, his, life, that, his, biggest, inspiration, was, kerouac, s, concept, of, spontaneous, prose, he, believed, literature, should, come, from, the, soul, without, conscious, restrictions, ginsberg, was, much, more, prone, to, revise, than, kerouac, for, example, when, kerouac, saw, the, first, draft, of, howl, he, disliked, the, fact, that, ginsberg, had, made, editorial, changes, in, pencil, transposing, negro, and, angry, in, the, first, line, for, example, kerouac, only, wrote, out, his, concepts, of, spontaneous, prose, at, ginsberg, s, insistence, because, ginsberg, wanted, to, learn, how, to, apply, the, technique, to, his, poetry, the, inspiration, for, howl, was, ginsberg, s, friend, carl, solomon, and, howl, is, dedicated, to, him, solomon, was, a, dada, and, surrealism, enthusiast, he, introduced, ginsberg, to, artaud, who, had, bouts, of, clinical, depression, solomon, wanted, to, commit, suicide, but, he, thought, a, form, of, suicide, appropriate, to, dadaism, would, be, to, go, to, a, mental, institution, and, demand, a, lobotomy, the, institution, refused, giving, him, many, forms, of, therapy, including, electroshock, therapy, much, of, the, final, section, of, the, first, part, of, howl, is, a, description, of, this, ginsberg, used, solomon, as, an, example, of, all, those, ground, down, by, the, machine, of, moloch, moloch, to, whom, the, second, section, is, addressed, is, a, levantine, god, to, whom, children, were, sacrificed, ginsberg, may, have, gotten, the, name, from, the, kenneth, rexroth, poem, thou, shalt, not, kill, a, poem, about, the, death, of, one, of, ginsberg, s, heroes, dylan, thomas, moloch, is, mentioned, a, few, times, in, the, torah, and, references, to, ginsberg, s, jewish, background, are, frequent, in, his, work, ginsberg, said, the, image, of, moloch, was, inspired, by, peyote, visions, he, had, of, the, francis, drake, hotel, in, san, francisco, which, appeared, to, him, as, a, skull, he, took, it, as, a, symbol, of, the, city, not, specifically, san, francisco, but, all, cities, ginsberg, later, acknowledged, in, various, publications, and, interviews, that, behind, the, visions, of, the, francis, drake, hotel, were, memories, of, the, moloch, of, fritz, lang, s, film, metropolis, 1927, and, of, the, woodcut, novels, of, lynd, ward, moloch, has, subsequently, been, interpreted, as, any, system, of, control, including, the, conformist, society, of, post, world, war, ii, america, focused, on, material, gain, which, ginsberg, frequently, blamed, for, the, destruction, of, all, those, outside, of, societal, norms, he, also, made, sure, to, emphasize, that, moloch, is, a, part, of, humanity, in, multiple, aspects, in, that, the, decision, to, defy, socially, created, systems, of, control, and, therefore, go, against, moloch, is, a, form, of, self, destruction, many, of, the, characters, ginsberg, references, in, howl, such, as, neal, cassady, and, herbert, huncke, destroyed, themselves, through, excessive, substance, abuse, or, a, generally, wild, lifestyle, the, personal, aspects, of, howl, are, perhaps, as, important, as, the, political, aspects, carl, solomon, the, prime, example, of, a, best, mind, destroyed, by, defying, society, is, associated, with, ginsberg, s, schizophrenic, mother, the, line, with, mother, finally, fucked, comes, after, a, long, section, about, carl, solomon, and, in, part, iii, ginsberg, says, i, m, with, you, in, rockland, where, you, imitate, the, shade, of, my, mother, ginsberg, later, admitted, that, the, drive, to, write, howl, was, fueled, by, sympathy, for, his, ailing, mother, an, issue, which, he, was, not, yet, ready, to, deal, with, directly, he, dealt, with, it, directly, with, 1959, s, kaddish, which, had, its, first, public, reading, at, a, catholic, worker, friday, night, meeting, possibly, due, to, its, associations, with, thomas, merton, ginsberg, s, poetry, was, strongly, influenced, by, modernism, most, importantly, the, american, style, of, modernism, pioneered, by, william, carlos, williams, romanticism, specifically, william, blake, and, john, keats, the, beat, and, cadence, of, jazz, specifically, that, of, bop, musicians, such, as, charlie, parker, and, his, kagyu, buddhist, practice, and, jewish, background, he, considered, himself, to, have, inherited, the, visionary, poetic, mantle, handed, down, from, the, english, poet, and, artist, william, blake, the, american, poet, walt, whitman, and, the, spanish, poet, federico, garc, a, lorca, the, power, of, ginsberg, s, verse, its, searching, probing, focus, its, long, and, lilting, lines, as, well, as, its, new, world, exuberance, all, echo, the, continuity, of, inspiration, that, he, claimed, he, corresponded, with, william, carlos, williams, who, was, then, in, the, middle, of, writing, his, epic, poem, paterson, about, the, industrial, city, near, his, home, after, attending, a, reading, by, williams, ginsberg, sent, the, older, poet, several, of, his, poems, and, wrote, an, introductory, letter, most, of, these, early, poems, were, rhymed, and, metered, and, included, archaic, pronouns, like, thee, williams, disliked, the, poems, and, told, ginsberg, in, this, mode, perfection, is, basic, and, these, poems, are, not, perfect, though, he, disliked, these, early, poems, williams, loved, the, exuberance, in, ginsberg, s, letter, he, included, the, letter, in, a, later, part, of, paterson, he, encouraged, ginsberg, not, to, emulate, the, old, masters, but, to, speak, with, his, own, voice, and, the, voice, of, the, common, american, from, williams, ginsberg, learned, to, focus, on, strong, visual, images, in, line, with, williams, own, motto, no, ideas, but, in, things, studying, williams, style, led, to, a, tremendous, shift, from, the, early, formalist, work, to, a, loose, colloquial, free, verse, style, early, breakthrough, poems, include, bricklayer, s, lunch, hour, and, dream, record, carl, solomon, introduced, ginsberg, to, the, work, of, antonin, artaud, to, have, done, with, the, judgement, of, god, and, van, gogh, the, man, suicided, by, society, and, jean, genet, our, lady, of, the, flowers, philip, lamantia, introduced, him, to, other, surrealists, and, surrealism, continued, to, be, an, influence, for, example, sections, of, kaddish, were, inspired, by, andr, breton, s, free, union, ginsberg, claimed, that, the, anaphoric, repetition, of, howl, and, other, poems, was, inspired, by, christopher, smart, in, such, poems, as, jubilate, agno, ginsberg, also, claimed, other, more, traditional, influences, such, as, franz, kafka, herman, melville, fyodor, dostoevsky, edgar, allan, poe, and, emily, dickinson, ginsberg, also, made, an, intense, study, of, haiku, and, the, paintings, of, paul, c, zanne, from, which, he, adapted, a, concept, important, to, his, work, which, he, called, the, eyeball, kick, he, noticed, in, viewing, c, zanne, s, paintings, that, when, the, eye, moved, from, one, color, to, a, contrasting, color, the, eye, would, spasm, or, kick, likewise, he, discovered, that, the, contrast, of, two, seeming, opposites, was, a, common, feature, in, haiku, ginsberg, used, this, technique, in, his, poetry, putting, together, two, starkly, dissimilar, images, something, weak, with, something, strong, an, artifact, of, high, culture, with, an, artifact, of, low, culture, something, holy, with, something, unholy, the, example, ginsberg, most, often, used, was, hydrogen, jukebox, which, later, became, the, title, of, a, song, cycle, composed, by, philip, glass, with, lyrics, drawn, from, ginsberg, s, poems, another, example, is, ginsberg, s, observation, on, bob, dylan, during, dylan, s, hectic, and, intense, 1966, electric, guitar, tour, fueled, by, a, cocktail, of, amphetamines, opiates, alcohol, and, psychedelics, as, a, dexedrine, clown, the, phrases, eyeball, kick, and, hydrogen, jukebox, both, show, up, in, howl, as, well, as, a, direct, quote, from, c, zanne, pater, omnipotens, aeterna, deus, allen, ginsberg, also, found, inspiration, in, music, he, frequently, included, music, in, his, poetry, invariably, composing, his, tunes, on, an, old, indian, harmonium, which, he, often, played, during, his, readings, he, wrote, and, recorded, music, to, accompany, william, blake, s, songs, of, innocence, and, songs, of, experience, he, also, recorded, a, handful, of, other, albums, to, create, music, for, howl, and, wichita, vortex, sutra, he, worked, with, the, minimalist, composer, philip, glass, ginsberg, worked, with, drew, inspiration, from, and, inspired, artists, such, as, bob, dylan, the, clash, patti, smith, phil, ochs, and, the, fugs, he, worked, with, dylan, on, various, projects, and, maintained, a, friendship, with, him, over, many, years, in, 1981, ginsberg, recorded, a, song, called, birdbrain, he, was, backed, by, the, gluons, and, the, track, was, released, as, a, single, in, 1996, he, recorded, a, song, co, written, with, paul, mccartney, and, philip, glass, the, ballad, of, the, skeletons, which, reached, number, 8, on, the, triple, j, hottest, 100, for, that, year, from, the, study, of, his, idols, and, mentors, and, the, inspiration, of, his, friends, not, to, mention, his, own, experiments, ginsberg, developed, an, individualistic, style, that, s, easily, identified, as, ginsbergian, ginsberg, stated, that, whitman, s, long, line, was, a, dynamic, technique, few, other, poets, had, ventured, to, develop, further, and, whitman, is, also, often, compared, to, ginsberg, because, their, poetry, sexualized, aspects, of, the, male, form, many, of, ginsberg, s, early, long, line, experiments, contain, some, sort, of, anaphora, repetition, of, a, fixed, base, for, example, who, in, howl, america, in, america, and, this, has, become, a, recognizable, feature, of, ginsberg, s, style, he, said, later, this, was, a, crutch, because, he, lacked, confidence, he, did, not, yet, trust, free, flight, in, the, 1960s, after, employing, it, in, some, sections, of, kaddish, caw, for, example, he, for, the, most, part, abandoned, the, anaphoric, form, latter, day, beat, bob, dylan, is, known, for, using, anaphora, as, in, tangled, up, in, blue, where, the, phrase, returned, to, at, the, end, of, every, verse, takes, the, place, of, a, chorus, several, of, his, earlier, experiments, with, methods, for, formatting, poems, as, a, whole, became, regular, aspects, of, his, style, in, later, poems, in, the, original, draft, of, howl, each, line, is, in, a, stepped, triadic, format, reminiscent, of, william, carlos, williams, he, abandoned, the, stepped, triadic, when, he, developed, his, long, line, although, the, stepped, lines, showed, up, later, most, significantly, in, the, travelogues, of, the, fall, of, america, howl, and, kaddish, arguably, his, two, most, important, poems, are, both, organized, as, an, inverted, pyramid, with, larger, sections, leading, to, smaller, sections, in, america, he, also, experimented, with, a, mix, of, longer, and, shorter, lines, ginsberg, s, mature, style, made, use, of, many, specific, highly, developed, techniques, which, he, expressed, in, the, poetic, slogans, he, used, in, his, naropa, teaching, prominent, among, these, was, the, inclusion, of, his, unedited, mental, associations, so, as, to, reveal, the, mind, at, work, first, thought, best, thought, mind, is, shapely, thought, is, shapely, he, preferred, expression, through, carefully, observed, physical, details, rather, than, abstract, statements, show, don, t, tell, no, ideas, but, in, things, in, these, he, carried, on, and, developed, traditions, of, modernism, in, writing, that, are, also, found, in, kerouac, and, whitman, in, howl, and, in, his, other, poetry, ginsberg, drew, inspiration, from, the, epic, free, verse, style, of, the, 19th, century, american, poet, walt, whitman, both, wrote, passionately, about, the, promise, and, betrayal, of, american, democracy, the, central, importance, of, erotic, experience, and, the, spiritual, quest, for, the, truth, of, everyday, existence, j, d, mcclatchy, editor, of, the, yale, review, called, ginsberg, the, best, known, american, poet, of, his, generation, as, much, a, social, force, as, a, literary, phenomenon, mcclatchy, added, that, ginsberg, like, whitman, was, a, bard, in, the, old, manner, outsized, darkly, prophetic, part, exuberance, part, prayer, part, rant, his, work, is, finally, a, history, of, our, era, s, psyche, with, all, its, contradictory, urges, mcclatchy, s, barbed, eulogies, define, the, essential, difference, between, ginsberg, a, beat, poet, whose, writing, was, journalism, raised, by, combining, the, recycling, genius, with, a, generous, mimic, empathy, to, strike, audience, accessible, chords, always, lyrical, and, sometimes, truly, poetic, and, kerouac, a, poet, of, singular, brilliance, the, brightest, luminary, of, a, beat, generation, he, came, to, symbolise, in, popular, culture, in, reality, he, far, surpassed, his, contemporaries, kerouac, is, an, originating, genius, exploring, then, answering, like, rimbaud, a, century, earlier, by, necessity, more, than, by, choice, the, demands, of, authentic, self, expression, as, applied, to, the, evolving, quicksilver, mind, of, america, s,
