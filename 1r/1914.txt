lose, a, test, series, and, it, is, said, that, his, fierce, will, to, win, contributed, to, this, achievement, his, captaincy, was, however, not, without, controversy, one, incident, was, his, aggressive, finger, flapping, appeal, leading, to, the, incorrect, dismissal, of, england, batsman, rob, bailey, in, the, barbados, test, in, 1990, which, was, described, by, wisden, as, at, best,

had, joined, somerset, in, 1984, there, he, made, his, highest, first, class, score, 322, when, they, played, warwickshire, in, 1985, however, despite, his, totemic, presence, at, somerset, over, time, his, performances, declined, as, he, devoted, most, of, his, time, to, international, cricket, the, county, finished, bottom, of, the, county, championship, in, 1985, and, next, to, bottom, in, 1986, in, 1988, the, county, was, surrounded, by, controversy, when, somerset, s, new, captain, peter, roebuck, became, an, instrumental, piece, in, the, decision, not, to, renew, the, contracts, of, richards, and, his, west, indies, teammate, joel, garner, whose, runs, and, wickets, had, brought, the, county, much, success, in, the, previous, eight, years, somerset, proposed, to, replace, the, pair, with, new, zealand, batsman, martin, crowe, consequently, ian, botham, refused, a, new, contract, with, somerset, in, protest, at, the, way, his, friends, richards, and, garner, had, been, treated, and, promptly, joined, worcestershire, after, many, years, of, bitterness, over, the, event, and, the, eventual, removal, of, roebuck, from, the, club, richards, was, eventually, honoured, with, the, naming, of, a, set, of, entrance, gates, after, him, at, the, county, ground, taunton, in, november, 1988, while, on, tour, of, australia, with, the, west, indies, richards, became, the, first, west, indies, player, to, reach, 100, first, class, centuries, by, scoring, 101, against, new, south, wales, richards, remains, the, only, west, indies, player, to, achieve, this, milestone,
