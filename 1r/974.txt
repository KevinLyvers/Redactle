lasting, impression, because, of, her, involvement, in, this, battle, shia, muslims, have, a, generally, negative, view, of, aisha, in, sunni, islam, aisha, is, viewed, as, a, leading, islamic, scholar, and, a, teacher, of, several, companions, and, the, tabi, in, biographical, information, on, muhammad, and, his, companions, are, recorded, in, hadiths, and, sira, hadiths, were, initially, narrated, orally, before, being, collected, and, compiled, by, hadith, scholars, in, islam, hadiths, are, regarded, as, fundamental, sources, second, only, to, the, quran, however, the, historical, reliability, of, both, hadith, and, sira, has, been, a, topic, of, debate, among, some, academic, circles, aisha, was, born, in, mecca, c, 613, 614, she, was, the, daughter, of, abu, bakr, and, umm, ruman, two, of, muhammad, s, most, trusted, companions, no, sources, offer, much, more, information, about, aisha, s, childhood, years, muhammad, said, that, he, had, twice, seen, aisha, in, his, dreams, being, carried, in, a, silk, cloth, by, an, angel, who, told, him, that, she, would, be, his, wife, muhammad, believed, that, if, the, dreams, were, from, god, he, would, make, them, come, true, following, the, death, of, his, first, wife, khadija, bint, khuwaylid, his, aunt, khawlah, bint, hakim, suggested, that, he, marry, aisha, aisha, s, father, abu, bakr, was, at, first, unsure, about, marrying, his, daughter, to, muhammad, he, thought, they, were, brothers, muhammad, clarified, that, they, were, merely, brothers, in, religion, and, it, was, legal, for, him, to, marry, aisha, aisha, s, engagement, to, jubayr, ibn, mut, im, a, boy, close, to, her, age, was, then, annulled, orientalist, w, montgomery, watt, suggests, that, muhammad, hoped, to, strengthen, his, ties, with, abu, bakr, the, strengthening, of, ties, commonly, served, as, a, basis, for, marriage, in, arabian, culture, all, extant, hadiths, agree, that, aisha, was, married, to, muhammad, in, mecca, but, the, marriage, was, consummated, only, in, the, month, of, shawwal, after, his, hijrah, to, medina, april, 623, some, classical, sources, have, aisha, speak, of, the, marriage, to, have, been, executed, in, medina, itself, without, referencing, to, any, delay, islamic, sources, of, the, classical, era, list, aisha, s, age, at, the, time, of, her, marriage, as, six, or, seven, and, nine, or, ten, at, its, consummation, in, a, hadith, from, sahih, al, bukhari, aisha, recollects, having, been, married, at, six, years, of, age, ibn, sa, d, s, biography, holds, her, age, at, the, time, of, marriage, as, between, six, and, seven, and, gives, her, age, at, consummation, to, be, nine, while, ibn, hisham, s, biography, of, muhammad, suggests, she, may, have, been, ten, years, old, at, consummation, al, tabari, notes, aisha, to, have, stayed, with, her, parents, after, the, marriage, and, consummated, the, relationship, at, nine, years, of, age, since, she, was, young, and, sexually, immature, at, the, time, of, marriage, however, elsewhere, tabari, appears, to, suggest, that, she, was, born, during, the, jahiliyyah, before, 610, ce, which, would, translate, to, an, age, of, about, twelve, or, more, at, marriage, in, islamic, literature, the, young, age, of, her, marriage, did, not, draw, any, significant, discourse, nonetheless, spellberg, and, ali, find, the, very, mention, of, her, age, to, be, atypical, of, early, muslim, biographers, and, hypothesize, a, connotation, to, her, virginity, and, more, than, that, religious, purity, her, age, did, not, interest, later, muslim, scholars, either, and, went, unremarked, upon, even, by, medieval, and, early, modern, christian, polemicists, early, orientalist, writers, even, in, their, condescending, approach, towards, muhammad, and, islam, were, primarily, concerned, with, muhammad, s, embrace, of, polygamy, and, the, ethics, of, marrying, for, political, causes, the, few, who, discussed, aisha, s, age, chose, to, explain, the, age, gap, by, citing, the, contemporary, understanding, of, the, orient, as, a, hot, place, that, promulgated, sexually, deviant, practices, beginning, late, nineteenth, century, with, the, east, and, its, alleged, immoralities, subject, to, increasing, opprobrium, the, colonizing, powers, sought, to, regulate, the, age, of, consent, as, such, efforts, ran, into, conflicts, with, local, forms, of, sharia, aisha, s, age, at, marriage, and, the, involved, prophetic, precedent, became, the, predominant, explanation, in, explaining, the, backwardness, of, muslim, societies, and, their, reticence, to, reforms, in, response, some, muslims, chose, to, align, themselves, with, the, projects, of, modernization, and, re, calculated, her, age, using, deft, stratagems, of, omission, and, commission, to, fix, it, at, early, adolescence, but, conservatives, rejected, such, revisionist, readings, since, they, flew, in, the, face, of, ilm, al, ad, th, from, mid, 20th, century, amidst, growing, concerns, of, islamic, extremism, as, muslim, societies, and, islam, itself, came, under, renewed, scrutiny, pointed, criticisms, of, aisha, s, young, age, at, marriage, began, to, be, abundant, this, has, since, prompted, many, muslim, scholars, to, contextualize, the, traditionally, accepted, age, of, aisha, with, renewed, vigor, emphasizing, on, cultural, relativism, anachronism, the, political, dimensions, of, the, marriage, aisha, s, non, ordinary, physique, etc, since, the, late, twentieth, century, polemicists, have, used, aisha, s, age, to, accuse, muhammad, of, pedophilia, and, to, explain, a, reported, higher, prevalence, of, child, marriage, in, muslim, societies, in, most, muslim, traditions, khadija, bint, khuwaylid, is, described, as, muhammad, s, most, beloved, and, favored, wife, sunni, tradition, places, aisha, as, second, only, to, khadija, there, are, several, hadiths, or, stories, or, sayings, of, muhammad, that, support, this, belief, one, relates, that, when, a, companion, asked, muhammad, who, is, the, person, you, love, most, in, the, world, he, responded, aisha, others, relate, that, muhammad, built, aisha, s, apartment, so, that, her, door, opened, directly, into, the, mosque, and, that, she, was, the, only, woman, with, whom, muhammad, received, revelations, they, bathed, in, the, same, water, and, he, prayed, while, she, lay, stretched, out, in, front, of, him, various, traditions, reveal, the, mutual, affection, between, muhammad, and, aisha, he, would, often, just, sit, and, watch, her, and, her, friends, play, with, dolls, and, on, occasion, he, would, even, join, them, aisha, must, have, felt, reasonably, equal, to, and, unawed, by, this, prophet, of, god, for, his, announcement, of, a, revelation, permitting, him, to, enter, into, marriages, disallowed, other, men, drew, from, her, the, retort, it, seems, to, me, your, lord, hastens, to, satisfy, your, desire, furthermore, muhammad, and, aisha, had, a, strong, intellectual, relationship, muhammad, valued, her, keen, memory, and, intelligence, and, so, instructed, his, companions, to, draw, some, of, their, religious, practices, from, her, when, muhammad, and, his, followers, carried, out, a, raid, on, the, banu, mustaliq, tribe, he, brought, along, aisha, who, was, 13, years, old, at, the, time, she, was, carried, in, a, closed, litter, on, the, back, of, a, camel, aisha, recounted, that, when, the, raiding, party, was, resting, at, night, on, the, way, home, to, medina, from, the, successful, operation, she, went, out, to, relieve, herself, after, doing, so, and, returning, to, her, litter, she, realized, that, her, necklace, was, missing, so, she, traced, her, way, back, to, look, for, it, by, the, time, she, found, it, the, convoy, had, already, left, thinking, she, was, in, the, litter, assuming, that, they, would, notice, her, absence, and, return, to, look, for, her, aisha, decided, to, stay, where, she, was, aisha, related, that, safwan, ibn, muattal, a, young, muslim, from, the, raiding, party, had, lagged, behind, for, some, reason, on, his, solo, return, journey, to, medina, he, came, across, aisha, sleeping, on, the, ground, by, herself, he, addressed, her, let, her, ride, on, his, camel, while, he, guided, it, and, escorted, her, home, to, medina, it, was, not, until, the, morning, that, muhammad, s, convoy, realized, that, aisha, was, not, in, her, litter, and, later, when, they, were, taking, a, break, from, the, hot, midday, sun, aisha, and, safwan, ran, into, them, a, rumor, accusing, aisha, of, committing, adultery, with, safwan, was, spread, by, abdullah, ibn, ubayy, ibn, salool, moreover, it, was, said, that, she, had, conversed, with, him, several, times, before, this, rumor, of, adultery, if, true, could, have, led, to, aisha, being, stoned, to, death, upon, their, arrival, in, medina, aisha, fell, ill, and, sensed, that, muhammad, was, uncharacteristically, cold, toward, her, she, only, learned, of, the, rumor, some, three, weeks, later, when, umm, mistah, told, her, on, their, way, back, from, defecating, in, an, open, field, at, night, as, was, customary, for, muslim, women, at, that, time, aisha, subsequently, went, to, her, mother, asking, what, the, people, were, talking, about, and, she, replied, daughter, be, at, peace, for, i, swear, by, god, that, no, beautiful, woman, is, married, to, a, man, who, has, other, wives, but, that, these, other, wives, would, find, fault, with, her, so, aisha, cried, all, night, long, muhammad, despite, his, fondness, for, aisha, was, unsure, of, her, innocence, he, asked, usama, ibn, zayd, and, ali, for, their, opinions, usama, vouched, for, aisha, s, innocence, but, ali, said, women, abound, you, can, easily, find, a, substitute, ask, her, slave, she, might, reveal, the, truth, when, the, slave, girl, arrived, ali, beat, her, severely, and, said, mind, you, tell, the, apostle, the, truth, but, her, answer, was, that, she, knew, only, good, things, about, aisha, with, the, single, exception, that, when, aisha, was, entrusted, with, watching, over, a, dough, she, dozed, off, and, allowed, a, sheep, to, eat, it, muhammad, later, visited, aisha, at, her, parents, house, and, advised, her, to, confess, if, she, had, sinned, as, god, was, merciful, towards, those, who, seek, repentance, it, had, been, more, than, a, month, since, aisha, had, returned, alone, with, safwan, despite, muhammad, s, advice, aisha, refused, to, apologize, as, it, would, indicate, guilt, she, told, muhammad, that, she, could, find, no, better, parallel, for, her, current, situation, than, that, of, joseph, s, father, who, had, endured, disbelief, despite, telling, the, truth, and, had, no, other, choice, but, to, remain, patient, shortly, thereafter, muhammad, experienced, a, trance, and, received, verses, quran, 24, 11, 15, that, confirmed, aisha, s, innocence, aisha, remained, muhammad, s, favorite, wife, throughout, his, life, when, he, became, ill, and, suspected, that, he, was, probably, going, to, die, he, began, to, ask, his, wives, whose, apartment, he, was, to, stay, in, next, they, eventually, figured, out, that, he, was, trying, to, determine, when, he, was, due, with, aisha, and, they, then, allowed, him, to, retire, there, he, remained, in, aisha, s, apartment, until, his, death, and, his, last, breath, was, taken, as, he, lay, in, the, arms, of, aisha, his, second, most, beloved, wife, aisha, s, importance, to, revitalizing, the, arab, tradition, and, leadership, among, the, arab, women, highlights, her, magnitude, within, islam, aisha, became, involved, in, the, politics, of, early, islam, and, the, first, three, caliphate, reigns, abu, bakr,

in, a, war, and, even, battles, and, helped, both, men, and, women, to, understand, the, practices, of, muhammad, after, muhammad, s, death, in, 632, abu, bakr, was, appointed, as, the, first, caliph, this, matter, of, succession, to, muhammad, is, extremely, controversial, to, the, shia, who, believe, that, ali, had, been, appointed, by, muhammad, to, lead, while, sunni, maintain, that, the, public, elected, abu, bakr, abu, bakr, had, two, advantages, in, achieving, his, new, role, his, long, personal, friendship, with, muhammad, and, his, role, as, a, father, in, law, as, caliph, abu, bakr, was, the, first, to, set, guidelines, for, the, new, position, of, authority, aisha, garnered, more, special, privileges, in, the, islamic, community, for, being, known, as, both, a, wife, of, muhammad, and, the, daughter, of, the, first, caliph, being, the, daughter, of, abu, bakr, tied, aisha, to, honorable, titles, earned, from, her, father, s, strong, dedication, to, islam, for,
