and, ensure, the, original, verdict, was, not, overturned, major, hubert, joseph, henry, forged, documents, that, made, it, seem, as, if, dreyfus, were, guilty, while, picquart, was, reassigned, to, duty, in, africa, however, picquart, s, findings, were, communicated, by, his, lawyer, to, the, senator, auguste, scheurer, kestner, who, took, up, the, case, at, first, discreetly, and, then,

convicted, on, 23, february, and, removed, from, the, legion, of, honour, the, first, judgment, was, overturned, in, april, on, a, technicality, but, a, new, suit, was, pressed, against, zola, which, opened, on, 18, july, at, his, lawyer, s, advice, zola, fled, to, england, rather, than, wait, for, the, end, of, the, trial, at, which, he, was, again, convicted, without, even, having, had, the, time, to, pack, a, few, clothes, he, arrived, at, victoria, station, on, 19, july, the, start, of, a, brief, and, unhappy, residence, in, the, uk, zola, visited, historic, locations, including, a,

afterwards, rented, a, house, locally, called, penn, where, he, was, joined, by, his, family, for, the, summer, at, the, end, of, august, they, moved, to, another, house, in, addlestone, called, summerfield, in, early, october, the, family, moved, to, london, and, then, his, wife, and, children, went, back, to, france, so, the, children, could, resume, their, schooling, thereafter, zola,

fact, of, major, henry, s, forgery, was, discovered, and, admitted, to, in, august, 1898, and, the, government, referred, dreyfus, s, original, court, martial, to, the, supreme, court, for, review, the, following, month, over, the, objections, of, the, general, staff, eight, months, later, on, 3, june, 1899, the, supreme, court, annulled, the, original, verdict, and, ordered, a, new, military, court, martial, the, same, month, zola, returned, from, his, exile, in, england, still, the, anti, dreyfusards, would, not, give, up, and, on, 9, september, 1899, dreyfus, was, again, convicted, dreyfus, applied, for, a, retrial, but, the, government, countered, by, offering, dreyfus, a, pardon, rather, than, exoneration, which, would, allow, him, to, go, free, provided, that, he, admit, to, being, guilty, although, he, was, clearly, not, guilty, he, chose, to, accept, the, pardon, later, the, same, month, despite, zola, s, condemnation, an, amnesty, bill, was, passed, covering, all, criminal, acts, or, misdemeanours, related, to, the, dreyfus, affair, or, that, have, been, included, in, a, prosecution, for, one, of, these, acts, indemnifying, zola, and, picquart, but, also, all, those, who, had, concocted, evidence, against, dreyfus, dreyfus, was, finally, completely, exonerated, by, the, supreme, court, in, 1906, zola, said, of, the, affair, the, truth, is, on, the, march, and, nothing, shall, stop, it, zola, s, 1898, article, is, widely, viewed, in, france, as, the, most, prominent, manifestation, of, the, new, power, of, the, intellectuals, writers, artists, academicians, in, shaping, public, opinion, the, media, and, the, state, on, august, 18, 1887, the, french, daily, newspaper, le, figaro, published, the, manifesto, of, the, five, shortly, after, la,

both, morals, and, aesthetics, throughout, the, book, s, depiction, of, the, revolution, the, manifesto, accused, zola, of, having, lowered, the, standard, of, naturalism, of, catering, to, large, sales, by, deliberate, obscenities, of, being, a, morbid, and, impotent, hypochondriac, incapable, of, taking, a, sane, and, healthy, view, of, mankind, they, freely, referred, to, zola, s, physiological, weaknesses, and, expressed, the, utmost, horror, at, the, crudeness, of, la, terre, zola, died, on, 29, september, 1902, of, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, caused, by, an, improperly, ventilated, chimney, his, funeral, on, 5, october, was, attended, by, thousands, alfred, dreyfus, initially, had, promised, not, to, attend, the, funeral, but, was, given, permission, by, zola, s, widow, and, attended, at, the, time, of, his, death, zola, had, just, completed, a, novel, v, rit, about, the, dreyfus, trial, a, sequel, justice, had, been, planned, but, was, not, completed, his, enemies, were, blamed, for, his, death, because, of, previous, attempts, on, his, life, but, nothing, could, be, proven, at, the, time, expressions, of, sympathy, arrived, from, everywhere, in, france, for, a, week, the, vestibule, of, his, house, was, crowded, with, notable, writers, scientists, artists, and, politicians, who, came, to, inscribe, their, names, in, the, registers, on, the, other, hand, zola, s, enemies, used, the, opportunity, to, celebrate, in, malicious, glee, writing, in, l, intransigeant, henri, rochefort, claimed, zola, had, committed, suicide, having, discovered, dreyfus, to, be, guilty, zola, was, initially, buried, in, the, cimeti, re, de, montmartre, in, paris, but, on, 4, june, 1908, just, five, years, and, nine, months, after, his, death, his, remains, were, relocated, to, the, panth, on, where, he, shares, a, crypt, with, victor, hugo, and, alexandre, dumas, the, ceremony, was, disrupted, by, an, assassination, attempt, on, alfred, dreyfus, by, louis, gr, gori, a, disgruntled, journalist, and, admirer, of, douard, drumont, in, which, dreyfus, was, wounded, in, the, arm, by, the, gunshot, gr, gori, was, acquitted, by, the, parisian, court, which, accepted, his, defense, that, he, had, not, meant, to, kill, dreyfus, meaning, merely, to, graze, him, a, 1953, investigation, by, journalist, jean, bedel, published, in, the, newspaper, lib, ration, under, the, headline, was, zola, assassinated, raised, the, idea, that, zola, s, death, might, have, been, a, murder, rather, than, an, accident, it, is, based, on, the, revelation, by, norman, pharmacist, pierre, hacquin, who, was, told, by, chimney, sweep, henri, buronfosse, that, he, intentionally, blocked, the, chimney, of, zola, s, apartment, in, paris, literary, historian, alain, pag, s, believes, that, is, likely, true, and, zola, s, great, granddaughters, brigitte, mile, zola, and, martine, le, blond, zola, corroborate, this, explanation, of, zola, s, poisoning, by, carbon, monoxide, as, reported, in, l, orient, le, jour, brigitte, mile, zola, recounts, that, her, grandfather, jacques, mile, zola, son, of, mile, zola, told, her, at, the, age, of, eight, that, in, 1952, a, man, came, to, his, house, to, give, him, information, about, his, father, s, death, the, man, had, been, with, a, dying, friend, who, had, confessed, to, taking, money, to, plug, emile, zola, s, chimney, zola, s, rougon, macquart, novels, are, a, panoramic, account, of, the, second, french, empire, they, tell, the, story, of, a, family, approximately, between, the, years, 1851, and, 1871, these, twenty, novels, contain, over, 300, characters, who, descend, from, the, two, family, lines, of, the, rougons, and, macquarts, in, zola, s, words, which, are, the, subtitle, of, the, rougon, macquart, series, they, are, l, histoire, naturelle, et, sociale, d, une, famille, sous, le, second, empire, the, natural, and, social, history, of, a, family, under, the, second, empire, most, of, the, rougon, macquart, novels, were, written, during, the, french, third, republic, to, an, extent, attitudes, and, value, judgments, may, have, been, superimposed, on, that, picture, with, the, wisdom, of, hindsight, some, critics, classify, zola, s, work, and, naturalism, more, broadly, as, a, particular, strain, of, decadent, literature, which, emphasized, the, fallen, corrupted, state, of, modern, civilization, nowhere, is, the, doom, laden, image, of, the, second, empire, so, clearly, seen, as, in, nana, which, culminates, in, echoes, of, the, franco, prussian, war, and, hence, by, implication, of, the, french, defeat, even, in, novels, dealing, with, earlier, periods, of, napoleon, iii, s, reign, the, picture, of, the, second, empire, is, sometimes, overlaid, with, the, imagery, of, catastrophe, in, the, rougon, macquart, novels, provincial, life, can, seem, to, be, overshadowed, by, zola, s, preoccupation, with, the, capital, however, the, following, novels, see, the, individual, titles, in, the, livre, de, poche, series, scarcely, touch, on, life, in, paris, la, terre, peasant, life, in, beauce, le, r, ve, an, unnamed, cathedral, city, germinal, collieries, in, the, northeast, of, france, la, joie, de, vivre, the, atlantic, coast, and, the, four, novels, set, in, and, around, plassans, modelled, on, his, childhood, home, aix, en, provence, la, fortune, des, rougon, la, conqu, te, de, plassans, la, faute, de, l, abb, mouret, and, le, docteur, pascal, la, d, b, cle, the, military, novel, is, set, for, the, most, part, in, country, districts, of, eastern, france, its, d, nouement, takes, place, in, the, capital, during, the, civil, war, leading, to, the, suppression, of, the, paris, commune, though, paris, has, its, role, in, la, b, te, humaine, the, most, striking, incidents, notably, the, train, crash, take, place, elsewhere, even, the, paris, centred, novels, tend, to, set, some, scenes, outside, if, not, very, far, from, the, capital, in, the, political, novel, son, excellence, eug, ne, rougon, the, eponymous, minister, s, interventions, on, behalf, of, his, so, called, friends, have, their, consequences, elsewhere, and, the, reader, is, witness, to, some, of, them, even, nana, one, of, zola, s, characters, most, strongly, associated, with, paris, makes, a, brief, and, typically, disastrous, trip, to, the, country, in, le, roman, exp, rimental, and, les, romanciers, naturalistes, zola, expounded, the, purposes, of, the, naturalist, novel, the, experimental, novel, was, to, serve, as, a, vehicle, for, scientific, experiment, analogous, to, the, experiments, conducted, by, claude, bernard, and, expounded, by, him, in, introduction, la, m, decine, exp, rimentale, claude, bernard, s, experiments, were, in, the, field, of, clinical, physiology, those, of, the, naturalist, writers, zola, being, their, leader, would, be, in, the, realm, of, psychology, influenced, by, the, natural, environment, balzac, zola, claimed, had, already, investigated, the, psychology, of, lechery, in, an, experimental, manner, in, the, figure, of, hector, hulot, in, la, cousine, bette, essential, to, zola, s, concept, of, the, experimental, novel, was, dispassionate, observation, of, the, world, with, all, that, it, involved, by, way, of, meticulous, documentation, to, him, each, novel, should, be, based, upon, a, dossier, with, this, aim, he, visited, the, colliery, of, anzin, in, northern, france, in, february, 1884, when, a, strike, was, on, he, visited, la, beauce, for, la, terre, sedan, ardennes, for, la, d, b, cle, and, travelled, on, the, railway, line, between, paris, and, le, havre, when, researching, la, b, te, humaine, zola, strongly, claimed, that, naturalist, literature, is, an, experimental, analysis, of, human, psychology, considering, this, claim, many, critics, such, as, gy, rgy, luk, cs, find, zola, strangely, poor, at, creating, lifelike, and, memorable, characters, in, the, manner, of, honor, de, balzac, or, charles, dickens, despite, his, ability, to, evoke, powerful, crowd, scenes, it, was, important, to, zola, that, no, character, should, appear, larger, than, life, but, the, criticism, that, his, characters, are, cardboard, is, substantially, more, damaging, zola, by, refusing, to, make, any, of, his, characters, larger, than, life, if, that, is, what, he, has, indeed, done, did, not, inhibit, himself, from, also, achieving, verisimilitude, although, zola, found, it, scientifically, and, artistically, unjustifiable, to, create, larger, than, life, characters, his, work, presents, some, larger, than, life, symbols, which, like, the, mine, le, voreux, in, germinal, take, on, the, nature, of, a, surrogate, human, life, the, mine, the, still, in, l, assommoir, and, the, locomotive, la, lison, in, la, b, te, humaine, impress, the, reader, with, the, vivid, reality, of, human, beings, the, great, natural, processes, of, seedtime, and, harvest, death, and, renewal, in, la, terre, are, instinct, with, a, vitality, which, is, not, human, but, is, the, elemental, energy, of, life, human, life, is, raised, to, the, level, of, the, mythical, as, the, hammerblows, of, titans, are, seemingly, heard, underground, at, le, voreux, or, as, in, la, faute, de, l, abb, mouret, the, walled, park, of, le, paradou, encloses, a, re, enactment, and,
