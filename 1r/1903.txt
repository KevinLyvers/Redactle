questioning, by, the, officer, and, his, assistant, the, officer, recommended, robinson, be, court, martialed, after, robinson, s, commander, in, the, 761st, paul, l, bates, refused, to, authorize, the, legal, action, robinson, was, summarily, transferred, to, the, 758th, battalion, where, the, commander, quickly, consented, to, charge, robinson, with, multiple, offenses, including, among, other, charges, public, drunkenness, even, though, robinson, did, not, drink, by, the, time, of, the, court, martial, in, august, 1944, the, charges, against, robinson, had, been, reduced, to, two, counts, of, insubordination, during, questioning, robinson, was, acquitted, by, an, all, white, panel, of, nine, officers, although, his, former, unit, the, 761st, tank, battalion, became, the, first,

robinson, met, a, former, player, for, the, kansas, city, monarchs, of, the, negro, american, league, who, encouraged, robinson, to, write, the, monarchs, and, ask, for, a, tryout, robinson, took, the, former, player, s, advice, and, wrote, to, monarchs, co, owner, thomas, baird, after, his, discharge, robinson, briefly, returned, to, his, old, football, club, the, los, angeles, bulldogs, robinson, then, accepted, an, offer, from, his, old, friend, and, pastor, rev, karl, downs, to, be, the, athletic, director, at, samuel, huston, college, in, austin, then, of, the, southwestern, athletic, conference, the, job, included, coaching, the, school, s, basketball, team, for, the, 1944, 45, season, as, it, was, a, fledgling, program, few, students, tried, out, for, the, basketball, team, and, robinson, even, resorted, to, inserting, himself, into, the, lineup, for, exhibition, games, although, his, teams, were, outmatched, by, opponents, robinson, was, respected, as, a, disciplinarian, coach, and, drew, the, admiration, of, among, others, langston, university, basketball, player, marques, haynes, a, future, member, of, the, harlem, globetrotters, in, early, 1945, while, robinson, was, at, sam, huston, college, the, kansas, city, monarchs, sent, him, a, written, offer, to, play, professional, baseball, in, the, negro, leagues, robinson, accepted, a, contract, for, 400, per, month, although, he, played, well, for, the, monarchs, robinson, was, frustrated, with, the, experience, he, had, grown, used, to, a, structured, playing, environment, in, college, and, the, negro, leagues, disorganization, and, embrace, of, gambling, interests, appalled, him, the, hectic, travel, schedule, also, placed, a, burden, on, his, relationship, with, isum, with, whom, he, could, now, communicate, only, by, letter, in, all, robinson, played, 47, games, at, shortstop, for, the, monarchs, hitting, 387, with, five, home, runs, and, registering, 13, stolen, bases, he, also, appeared, in, the, 1945, east, west, all, star, game, going, hitless, in, five, at, bats, during, the, season, robinson, pursued, potential, major, league, interests, no, black, man, had, played, in, the, major, leagues, since, moses, fleetwood, walker, in, 1884, but, the, boston, red, sox, nevertheless, held, a, tryout, at, fenway, park, for, robinson, and, other, black, players, on, april, 16, the, tryout, however, was, a, farce, chiefly, designed, to, assuage, the, desegregationist, sensibilities, of, powerful, boston, city, councilman, isadore, h, y, muchnick, even, with, the, stands, limited, to, management, robinson, was, subjected, to, racial, epithets, he, left, the, tryout, humiliated, and, more, than, 14, years, later, in, july, 1959, the, red, sox, became, the, final, major, league, team, to, integrate, its, roster, other, teams, however, had, more, serious, interest, in, signing, a, black, ballplayer, in, the, mid, 1940s, branch, rickey, club, president, and, general, manager, of, the, brooklyn, dodgers, began, to, scout, the, negro, leagues, for, a, possible, addition, to, the, dodgers, roster, rickey, selected, robinson, from, a, list, of, promising, black, players, and, interviewed, him, for, possible, assignment, to, brooklyn, s, international, league, farm, club, the, montreal, royals, rickey, was, especially, interested, in, making, sure, his, eventual, signee, could, withstand, the, inevitable, racial, abuse, that, would, be, directed, at, him, in, a, famous, three, hour, exchange, on, august, 28, 1945, rickey, asked, robinson, if, he, could, face, the, racial, animus, without, taking, the, bait, and, reacting, angrily, a, concern, given, robinson, s, prior, arguments, with, law, enforcement, officials, at, pjc, and, in, the, military, robinson, was, aghast, are, you, looking, for, a, negro, who, is, afraid, to, fight, back, rickey, replied, that, he, needed, a, negro, player, with, guts, enough, not, to, fight, back, after, obtaining, a, commitment, from, robinson, to, turn, the, other, cheek, to, racial, antagonism, rickey, agreed, to, sign, him, to, a, contract, for, 600, a, month, equal, to, 10, 155, today, rickey, did, not, offer, compensation, to, the, monarchs, instead, believing, all, negro, league, players, were, free, agents, due, to, the, contracts, not, containing, a, reserve, clause, among, those, with, whom, rickey, discussed, prospects, was, wendell, smith, writer, for, the, black, weekly, pittsburgh, courier, who, according, to, cleveland, indians, owner, and, team, president, bill, veeck, influenced, rickey, to, take, jack, robinson, for, which, he, s, never, completely, gotten, credit, although, he, required, robinson, to, keep, the, arrangement, a, secret, for, the, time, being, rickey, committed, to, formally, signing, robinson, before, november, 1, 1945, on, october, 23, it, was, publicly, announced, that, robinson, would, be, assigned, to, the, royals, for, the, 1946, season, on, the, same, day, with, representatives, of, the, royals, and, dodgers, present, robinson, formally, signed, his, contract, with, the, royals, in, what, was, later, referred, to, as, the, noble, experiment, robinson, was, the, first, black, baseball, player, in, the, international, league, since, the, 1880s, he, was, not, necessarily, the, best, player, in, the, negro, leagues, and, black, talents, satchel, paige, and, josh, gibson, were, upset, when, robinson, was, selected, first, larry, doby, who, broke, the, color, line, in, the, american, league, the, same, year, as, robinson, said, one, of, the, things, that, was, disappointing, and, disheartening, to, a, lot, of, the, black, players, at, the, time, was, that, jack, was, not, the, best, player, the, best, was, josh, gibson, i, think, that, s, one, of, the, reasons, why, josh, died, so, early, he, was, heartbroken, rickey, s, offer, allowed, robinson, to, leave, behind, the, monarchs, and, their, grueling, bus, rides, and, he, went, home, to, pasadena, that, september, he, signed, with, chet, brewer, s, kansas, city, royals, a, post, season, barnstorming, team, in, the, california, winter, league, later, that, off, season, he, briefly, toured, south, america, with, another, barnstorming, team, while, his, fianc, e, isum, pursued, nursing, opportunities, in, new, york, city, on, february, 10, 1946, robinson, and, isum, were, married, by, their, old, friend, the, rev, karl, downs, in, 1946, robinson, arrived, at, daytona, beach, florida, for, spring, training, with, the, montreal, royals, of, the, class, aaa, international, league, clay, hopper, the, manager, of, the, royals, asked, rickey, to, assign, robinson, to, any, other, dodger, affiliate, but, rickey, refused, robinson, s, presence, was, controversial, in, racially, segregated, florida, he, was, not, allowed, to, stay, with, his, white, teammates, at, the, team, hotel, and, instead, lodged, at, the, home, of, joe, and, dufferin, harris, a, politically, active, african, american, couple, who, introduced, the, robinsons, to, civil, rights, activist, mary, mcleod, bethune, since, the, dodgers, organization, did, not, own, a, spring, training, facility, scheduling, was, subject, to, the, whim, of, area, localities, several, of, which, turned, down, any, event, involving, robinson, or, johnny, wright, another, black, player, whom, rickey, had, signed, to, the, dodgers, organization, in, january, in, sanford, florida, the, police, chief, threatened, to, cancel, games, if, robinson, and, wright, did, not, cease, training, activities, there, as, a, result, robinson, was, sent, back, to, daytona, beach, in, jacksonville, the, stadium, was, padlocked, shut, without, warning, on, game, day, by, order, of, the, city, s, parks, and, public, property, director, in, deland, a, scheduled, day, game, was, postponed, ostensibly, because, of, issues, with, the, stadium, s, electrical, lighting, after, much, lobbying, of, local, officials, by, rickey, himself, the, royals, were, allowed, to, host, a, game, involving, robinson, in, daytona, beach, robinson, made, his, royals, debut, at, daytona, beach, s, city, island, ballpark, on, march, 17, 1946, in, an, exhibition, game, against, the, team, s, parent, club, the, dodgers, robinson, thus, became, the, first, black, player, to, openly, play, for, a, minor, league, team, against, a, major, league, team, since, the, de, facto, baseball, color, line, had, been, implemented, in, the, 1880s, later, in, spring, training, after, some, less, than, stellar, performances, robinson, was, shifted, from, shortstop, to, second, base, allowing, him, to, make, shorter, throws, to, first, base, robinson, s, performance, soon, rebounded, on, april, 18, 1946, roosevelt, stadium, hosted, the, jersey, city, giants, season, opener, against, the, montreal, royals, marking, the, professional, debut, of, the, royals, jackie, robinson, and, the, first, time, the, color, barrier, had, been, broken, in, a, game, between, two, minor, league, clubs, pitching, against, robinson, was, warren, sandel, who, had, played, against, him, when, they, both, lived, in, california, during, robinson, s, first, at, bat, the, jersey, city, catcher, dick, bouknight, demanded, that, sandel, throw, at, robinson, but, sandel, refused, although, sandel, induced, robinson, to, ground, out, at, his, first, at, bat, robinson, ended, up, with, four, hits, in, his, five, at, bats, his, first, hit, was, a, three, run, home, run, in, the, game, s, third, inning, he, also, scored, four, runs, drove, in, three, and, stole, two, bases, in, the, royals, 14, 1, victory, robinson, proceeded, to, lead, the, international, league, that, season, with, a, 349, batting, average, and, 985, fielding, percentage, and, he, was, named, the, league, s, most, valuable, player, although, he, often, faced, hostility, while, on, road, trips, the, royals, were, forced, to, cancel, a, southern, exhibition, tour, for, example, the, montreal, fan, base, enthusiastically, supported, robinson, whether, fans, supported, or, opposed, it, robinson, s, presence, on, the, field, was, a, boon, to, attendance, more, than, one, million, people, went, to, games, involving, robinson, in, 1946, an, astounding, figure, by, international, league, standards, in, the, fall, of, 1946, following, the, baseball, season, robinson, returned, home, to, california, and, briefly, played, professional, basketball, for, the, short, lived, los, angeles, red, devils, in, 1947, the, dodgers, called, robinson, up, to, the, major, leagues, six, days, before, the, start, of, the, season, with, eddie, stanky, entrenched, at, second, base, for, the, dodgers, robinson, played, his, initial,

the, first, player, since, 1884, to, openly, break, the, major, league, baseball, color, line, black, fans, began, flocking, to, see, the, dodgers, when, they, came, to, town, abandoning, their, negro, league, teams, robinson, s, promotion, met, a, generally, positive, although, mixed, reception, among, newspapers, and, white, major, league, players, however, racial, tension, existed, in, the, dodger, clubhouse, some, dodger, players, insinuated, they, would, sit, out, rather, than, play, alongside, robinson, the, brewing, mutiny, ended, when, dodgers, management, took, a, stand, for, robinson, manager, leo, durocher, informed, the, team, i, do, not, care, if, the, guy, is, yellow, or, black, or, if, he, has, stripes, like, a, fuckin, zebra, i, m, the, manager, of, this, team, and, i, say, he, plays, what, s, more, i, say, he, can, make, us, all, rich, and, if, any, of, you, cannot, use, the, money, i, will, see, that, you, are, all, traded, robinson, was, also, derided, by, opposing, teams, according, to, a, press, report, the, st, louis, cardinals, threatened, to, strike, if, robinson, played, and, spread, the, walkout, across, the, entire, national, league, existence, of, the, plot, was, said, to, have, been, leaked, by, the, cardinals, team, physician, robert, hyland, to, a, friend, the, new, york, herald, tribune, s, rud, rennie, the, reporter, concerned, about, protecting, hyland, s, anonymity, and, job, in, turn, leaked, it, to, his, tribune, colleague, and, editor, stanley, woodward, whose, own, subsequent, reporting, with, other, sources, protected, hyland, the, woodward, article, made, national, headlines, after, it, was, published, national, league, president, ford, frick, and, baseball, commissioner, happy, chandler, let, it, be, known, that, any, striking, players, would, be, suspended, you, will, find, that, the, friends, that, you, think, you, have, in, the, press, box, will, not, support, you, that, you, will, be, outcasts, frick, was, quoted, as, saying, i, do, not, care, if, half, the, league, strikes, those, who, do, it, will, encounter, quick, retribution, all, will, be, suspended, and, i, don, t, care, if, it, wrecks, the, national, league, for, five, years, this, is, the, united, states, of, america, and, one, citizen, has, as, much, right, to, play, as, another, woodward, s, article, received, the, e, p, dutton, award, in, 1947, for, best, sports, reporting, the, cardinals, players, denied, that, they, were, planning, to, strike, and, woodward, later, told, author, roger, kahn, that, frick, was, his, true, source, writer, warren, corbett, said, that, frick, s, speech, never, happened, regardless, the, report, led, to, robinson, receiving, increased, support, from, the, sports, media, even, the, sporting, news, a, publication, that, had, backed, the, color, line, came, out, against, the, idea, of, a, strike, robinson, nonetheless, became, the, target, of, rough, physical, play, by, opponents, particularly, the, cardinals, at, one, time, he, received, a, seven, inch, gash, in, his, leg, from, enos, slaughter, on, april, 22, 1947, during, a, game, between, the, dodgers, and, the, philadelphia, phillies, phillies, players, and, manager, ben, chapman, called, robinson, a, nigger, from, their, dugout, and, yelled, that, he, should, go, back, to, the, cotton, fields, rickey, later, recalled, that, chapman, did, more, than, anybody, to, unite, the, dodgers, when, he, poured, out, that, string, of, unconscionable, abuse, he, solidified, and, united, thirty, men, however, robinson, received, significant, encouragement, from, several, major, league, players, robinson, named, lee, jeep, handley, who, played, for, the, phillies, at, the, time, as, the, first, opposing, player, to, wish, him, well, dodgers, teammate, pee, wee, reese, once, came, to, robinson, s, defense, with, the, famous, line, you, can, hate, a, man, for, many, reasons, color, is, not, one, of,

deal, with, ethnic, epithets, during, his, career, also, encouraged, robinson, following, an, incident, where, greenberg, collided, with, robinson, at, first, base, he, whispered, a, few, words, into, robinson, s, ear, which, robinson, later, characterized, as, words, of, encouragement, greenberg, had, advised, him, to, overcome, his, critics, by, defeating, them, in, games, robinson, also, talked, frequently, with, larry, doby, who, endured, his, own, hardships, since, becoming, the, first, black, player, in, the, american, league, with, the, cleveland, indians, as, the, two, spoke, to, each, other, via, telephone, throughout, the, season, robinson, finished, the, season, having, played, in, 151, games, for, the, dodgers, with, a, batting, average, of, 297, an, on, base, percentage, of,

pressure, on, robinson, eased, in, 1948, when, a, number, of, other, black, players, entered, the, major, leagues, larry, doby, who, broke, the, color, barrier, in, the, american, league, on, july, 5, 1947, just, 11, weeks, after, robinson, and, satchel, paige, played, for, the, cleveland, indians, and, the, dodgers, had, three, other, black, players, besides, robinson, in, february, 1948, he, signed, a, 12, 500, contract, equal, to, 158, 518, today, with, the, dodgers, while, a, significant, amount, this, was, less, than, robinson, made, in, the, off, season, from, a, vaudeville, tour, where, he, answered, pre, set, baseball, questions, and, a, speaking, tour, of, the, south, between, the, tours, he, underwent, surgery, on, his, right, ankle, because, of, his, off, season,

batting, help, at, sisler, s, suggestion, robinson, spent, hours, at, a, batting, tee, learning, to, hit, the, ball, to, right, field, sisler, taught, robinson, to, anticipate, a, fastball, on, the, theory, that, it, is, easier, to, subsequently, adjust, to, a, slower, curveball, robinson, also, noted, that, sisler, showed, me, how, to, stop, lunging, how, to, check, my, swing, until, the, last, fraction, of, a, second, the, tutelage, helped, robinson, raise, his, batting, average, from, 296, in, 1948, to, 342, in, 1949, in, addition, to, his, improved, batting, average, robinson, stole, 37,

unwanted, distraction, for, robinson, in, july, he, was, called, to, testify, before, the, united, states, house, of, representatives, committee, on, un, american, activities, huac, concerning, statements, made, that, april, by, black, athlete, and, actor, paul, robeson, robinson, was, reluctant, to, testify, but, he, eventually, agreed, to, do, so, fearing, it, might, negatively, affect, his, career, if, he, declined, in, 1950, robinson, led, the, national, league, in, double, plays, made, by, a, second, baseman, with, 133, his, salary, that, year, was, the, highest, any, dodger, had, been, paid, to, that, point, 35, 000, 443, 237, in, 2023, dollars, he, finished, the, year, with, 99, runs, scored, a, 328, batting, average, and, 12, stolen, bases, the, year, saw, the, release, of, a, film, biography, of, robinson, s, life, the, jackie, robinson, story, in, which, robinson, played, himself, and, actress, ruby, dee, played, rachel, rae, isum, robinson, the, project, had, been, previously, delayed, when, the, film, s, producers, refused, to, accede, to, demands, of, two, hollywood, studios, that, the, movie, include, scenes, of, robinson, being, tutored, in, baseball, by, a, white, man, the, new, york, times, wrote, that, robinson, doing, that, rare, thing, of, playing, himself, in, the, picture, s, leading, role, displays, a, calm, assurance, and, composure, that, might, be, envied, by, many, a, hollywood, star, robinson, s, hollywood, exploits, however, did, not, sit, well, with, dodgers, co, owner, walter, o, malley, who, referred, to, robinson, as, rickey, s, prima, donna, in, late, 1950, rickey, s, contract, as, the, dodgers, team, president, expired, weary, of, constant, disagreements, with, o, malley, and, with, no, hope, of, being, re, appointed, as, president, of, the, dodgers, rickey, cashed, out, his, one, quarter, financial, interest, in, the, team, leaving, o, malley, in, full, control, of, the, franchise, rickey, shortly, thereafter, became, general, manager, of, the, pittsburgh, pirates, robinson, was, disappointed, at, the, turn, of, events, and, wrote, a, sympathetic, letter, to, rickey, whom, he, considered, a, father, figure, stating, regardless, of, what, happens, to, me, in, the, future, it, all, can, be, placed, on, what, you, have, done, and, believe, me, i, appreciate, it, before, the, 1951, season, o, malley, reportedly, offered, robinson, the, job, of, manager, of, the, montreal, royals, effective, at, the, end, of, robinson, s, playing, career, o, malley, was, quoted, in, the, montreal, standard, as, saying, jackie, told, me, that, he, would, be, both, delighted, and, honored, to, tackle, this, managerial, post, although, reports, differed, as, to, whether, a, position, was, ever, formally, offered, during, the, 1951, season, robinson, led, the, national, league, in, double, plays, made, by, a, second, baseman, for, the, second, year, in, a, row, with, 137, he, also, kept, the, dodgers, in, contention, for, the, 1951, pennant, during, the, last, game, of, the, regular, season, in, the, 13th, inning, he, had, a, hit, to, tie, the, game, and, then, hit, a, home, run, in, the, 14th, inning, which, proved, to, be, the, winning, margin, this, forced, a, best, of, three, playoff, series, against, the, crosstown, rival, new, york, giants, despite, robinson, s, regular, season, heroics, on, october, 3, 1951, the, dodgers, lost, the, pennant, on, bobby, thomson, s, famous, home, run, known, as, the, shot, heard, round, the, world, overcoming, his, dejection, robinson, dutifully, observed, thomson, s, feet, to, ensure, he, touched, all, the, bases, dodgers, sportscaster, vin, scully, later, noted, that, the, incident, showed, how, much, of, a, competitor, robinson, was, he, finished, the, season, with, 106, runs, scored, a, batting, average, of, 335, and, 25, stolen, bases, robinson, had, what, was, an, average, year, for, him, in, 1952, he, finished, the, year, with, 104, runs, a, 308, batting, average, and, 24, stolen, bases, he, did, however, record, a, career, high, on, base, percentage, of, 436, the, dodgers, improved, on, their, performance, from, the, year, before, winning, the, national, league, pennant, before, losing, the, 1952, world, series, to, the, new, york, yankees, in, seven, games, that, year, on, the, television, show, youth, wants, to, know, robinson, challenged, the, yankees, general, manager, george, weiss, on, the, racial, record, of, his, team, which, had, yet, to, sign, a, black, player, sportswriter, dick, young, whom, robinson, had, described, as, a, bigot, said, if, there, was, one, flaw, in, jackie, it, was, the, common, one, he, believed, that, everything, unpleasant, that, happened, to, him, happened, because, of, his, blackness, the, 1952, season, was, the, last, year, robinson, was, an, everyday, starter, at, second, base, afterward, robinson, played, variously, at, first, second, and, third, bases, shortstop, and, in, the, outfield, with, jim, gilliam, another, black, player, taking, over, everyday, second, base, duties, robinson, s, interests, began, to, shift, toward, the, prospect, of, managing, a, major, league, team, he, had, hoped, to, gain, experience, by, managing, in, the, puerto, rican, winter, league, but, according, to, the, new, york, post, commissioner, happy, chandler, denied, the, request, in, 1953, robinson, had, 109, runs, a, 329, batting, average, and, 17, steals, leading, the, dodgers, to, another, national, league, pennant, and, another, world, series, loss, to, the, yankees, this, time, in, six, games, robinson, s, continued, success, spawned, a, string, of, death, threats, he, was, not, dissuaded, however, from, addressing, racial, issues, publicly, that, year, he, served, as, editor, for, our, sports, magazine, a, periodical, focusing, on, negro, sports, issues, contributions, to, the, magazine, included, an, article, on, golf, course, segregation, by, robinson, s, old, friend, joe, louis, robinson, also, openly, criticized, segregated, hotels, and, restaurants, that, served, the, dodger, organization, a, number, of, these, establishments, integrated, as, a, result, including, the, five, star, chase, park, hotel, in, st, louis, in, 1954, robinson, had, 62, runs, scored, a, 311, batting, average, and, 7, steals, his, best, day, at, the, plate, was, on, june, 17, when, he, hit, two, home, runs, and, two, doubles, the, following, autumn, robinson, won, his, only, championship, when, the, dodgers, defeated, the, new, york, yankees, in, the, 1955, world, series, although, the, team, enjoyed, ultimate, success, 1955, was, the, worst, year, of, robinson, s, individual, career, he, hit, 256, and, stole, only, 12, bases, the, dodgers, tried, robinson, in, the, outfield, and, as, a, third, baseman, both, because, of, his, diminishing, abilities, and, because, gilliam, was, established, at, second, base, robinson, then, 36, years, old, missed, 49, games, and, did, not, play, in, game, 7, of, the, world, series, he, missed, the, game, because, manager, walter, alston, decided, to, play, gilliam, at, second, and, don, hoak, at, third, base, that, season, the, dodgers, don, newcombe, became, the, first, black, major, league, pitcher, to, win, twenty, games, in, a, year, in, 1956, robinson, had, 61, runs, scored, a, 275, batting, average, and, 12, steals, by, then, he, had, begun, to, exhibit, the, effects, of, diabetes, and, to, lose, interest, in, the, prospect, of, playing, or, managing, professional, baseball, robinson, ended, his, major, league, career, when, he, struck, out, to, end, game, 7, of, the, 1956, world, series, after, the, season, the, dodgers, traded, robinson, to, the, arch, rival, new, york, giants, for, dick, littlefield, and, 35, 000, cash, equal, to, 392, 240, today, the, trade, however, was, never, completed, unbeknownst, to, the, dodgers, robinson, had, already, agreed, with, the, president, of, chock, full, o, nuts, to, quit, baseball, and, become, an, executive, with, the, company, since, robinson, had, sold, exclusive, rights, to, any, retirement, story, to, look, magazine, two, years, previously, his, retirement, decision, was, revealed, through, the, magazine, instead, of, through, the, dodgers, organization, robinson, s, major, league, debut, brought, an, end, to, approximately, sixty, years, of, segregation, in, professional, baseball, known, as, the, baseball, color, line, after, world, war, ii, several, other, forces, were, also, leading, the, country, toward, increased, equality, for, blacks, including, their, accelerated, migration, to, the, north, where, their, political, clout, grew, and, president, harry, truman, s, desegregation, of, the, military, in, 1948, robinson, s, breaking, of, the, baseball, color, line, and, his, professional, success, symbolized, these, broader, changes, and, demonstrated, that, the, fight, for, equality, was, more, than, simply, a, political, matter, civil, rights, movement, leader, martin, luther, king, jr, said, that, he, was, a, legend, and, a, symbol, in, his, own, time, and, that, he, challenged, the, dark, skies, of, intolerance, and, frustration, according, to, historian, doris, kearns, goodwin, robinson, s, efforts, were, a, monumental, step, in, the, civil, rights, revolution, in, america, accomplishments, allowed, black, and, white, americans, to, be, more, respectful, and, open, to, one, another, and, more, appreciative, of, everyone, s, abilities, beginning, his, major, league, career, at, the, relatively, advanced, age, of, 28, he, played, only, ten, seasons, from, 1947, to, 1956, all, of, them, for, the, brooklyn, dodgers, during, his, career, the, dodgers, played, in, six, world, series, and, robinson, himself, played, in, six, all, star, games, in, 1999, he, was, one, of, 30, players, named, to, the, major, league, baseball, all, century, team, robinson, s, career, is, generally, considered, to, mark, the, beginning, of, the, post, long, ball, era, in, baseball, in, which, a, reliance, on, raw, power, hitting, gave, way, to, balanced, offensive, strategies, that, used, footspeed, to, create, runs, through, aggressive, baserunning, robinson, exhibited, the, combination, of, hitting, ability, and, speed, which, exemplified, the, new, era, he, scored, more, than, 100, runs, in, six, of, his, ten, seasons, averaging, more, than, 110, runs, from, 1947, to, 1953, had, a, 311, career, batting, average, a, 409, career, on, base, percentage, a, 474, slugging, percentage, and, substantially, more, walks, than, strikeouts, 740, to, 291, robinson, was, one, of, only, two, players, during, the, span, of, 1947, 56, to, accumulate, at, least, 125, steals, while, registering, a, slugging, percentage, over, 425, minnie, mi, oso, was, the, other, he, accumulated, 197, stolen, bases, in, total, including, 19, steals, of, home, none, of, the, latter, were, double, steals, in, which, a, player, stealing, home, is, assisted, by, a, player, stealing, another, base, at, the, same, time, robinson, has, been, referred, to, by, author, david, falkner, as, the, father, of, modern, base, stealing, historical, statistical, analysis, indicates, robinson, was, an, outstanding, fielder, throughout, his, ten, years, in, the, major, leagues, and, at, virtually, every, position, he, played, after, playing, his, rookie, season, at, first, base, robinson, spent, most, of, his, career, as, a, second, baseman, he, led, the, league, in, fielding, among, second, basemen, in, 1950, and, 1951, toward, the, end, of, his, career, he, played, about, 2, 000, innings, at, third, base, and, about, 1, 175, innings, in, the, outfield, excelling, at, both, assessing, himself, robinson, said, i, m, not, concerned, with, your, liking, or, disliking, me, all, i, ask, is, that, you, respect, me, as, a, human, being, regarding, robinson,

that, the, game, of, baseball, is, great, but, the, greatest, thing, is, what, you, do, after, your, career, is, over, robinson, retired, from, baseball, at, age, 37, on, january, 5, 1957, later, that, year, after, he, complained, of, numerous, physical, ailments, he, was, diagnosed, with, diabetes, a, disease, that, also, afflicted, his, brothers, although, robinson, adopted, an, insulin, injection, regimen, the, state, of, medicine, at, the, time, could, not, prevent, the, continued, deterioration, of, robinson, s, physical, condition, from, the, disease, in, october, 1959, robinson, entered, the, greenville, municipal, airport, s, whites, only, waiting, room, airport, police, asked, robinson, to, leave, but, he, refused, at, a, national, association, for, the, advancement, of,
