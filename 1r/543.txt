january, 16, 1938, it, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, significant, concerts, in, jazz, history, after, years, of, work, by, musicians, from, all, over, the, country, jazz, had, finally, been, accepted, by, mainstream, audiences, according, to, stan, ayeroff, the, concert, helped, jazz, evolve, from, being, strictly, dance, music, to, music, worthy, of, a, discerning, listening, audience, it, was, the, start, of, jazz, being, recognized, as, an, art, form, on, a, par, with, classical, music, recordings, of, the, concert, were, made, but, even, by, the, technology, of, the, day, the, equipment, used, was, not, of, the, finest, quality, these, recordings, were, made, on, acetate, and, aluminum, studio, masters, were, cut, the, idea, of, recording, the, concert, came, from, albert, marx, a, friend, of, goodman, s, for, the, purposes, of, a, gift, for, his, wife, helen, ward, as, well, as, gifting, a, second, set, to, goodman, sometime, in, or, before, 1950, goodman, recovered, the, acetates, from, his, sister, in, law, s, closet, who, had, informed, him, about, them, and, took, them, to, the, audio, engineer, william, savory, the, pair, took, them, to, columbia, with, goodman, realising, the, recordings, could, be, used, as, leverage, to, make, a, recording, contract, with, columbia, having, been, eager, to, end, his, contract, with, capitol, a, selection, was, then, released, as, an, lp, entitled, the, famous, 1938, carnegie, hall, jazz, concert, 365, 367, in, 1939, pianist, and, arranger, mary, lou, williams, suggested, to, john, hammond, who, was, responsible, for, finding, new, talent, for, goodman, that, he, see, guitarist, charlie, christian, hammond, had, seen, christian, perform, in, oklahoma, city, on, july, 10, 1939, and, recommended, him, to, goodman, but, goodman, was, uninterested, in, electric, guitar, and, was, put, off, by, christian, s, taste, in, gaudy, clothing, unbeknownst, to, goodman, at, an, august, 16, concert, at, the, victor, hugo, restaurant, in, beverly, hills, hammond, inserted, christian, onto, the, stage, goodman, started, playing, rose, room, on, the, assumption, that, christian, didn, t, know, it, but, his, performance, impressed, the, audience, immensely, according, to, hammond, before, long, the, crowd, was, screaming, with, amazement, rose, room, continued, for, more, than, three, quarters, of, an, hour, and, goodman, received, an, ovation, unlike, any, even, he, had, before, no, one, present, will, ever, forget, it, least, of, all, benny, christian, was, a, member, of, the, benny, goodman, sextet, from, 1939, to, 1941, and, during, these, two, years, he, turned, the, electric, guitar, into, a, popular, jazz, instrument, goodman, continued, his, success, throughout, the, late, 1930s, with, his, big, band, his, trio, and, quartet, and, the, sextet, formed, in, august, 1939, the, same, month, goodman, returned, to, columbia, records, after, four, years, with, rca, victor, at, columbia, john, hammond, his, future, brother, in, law, produced, most, of, his, sessions, by, the, mid, 1940s, however, big, bands, had, lost, much, of, their, popularity, in, 1941, ascap, had, a, licensing, war, with, music, publishers, from, 1942, to, 1944, and, again, in, 1948, the, musicians, union, went, on, strike, against, the, major, record, labels, in, the, united, states, and, singers, acquired, the, popularity, that, the, big, bands, had, once, enjoyed, during, the, 1942, 44, strike, the, war, department, approached, the, union, and, requested, the, production, of, v, discs, a, set, of, records, containing, new, recordings, for, soldiers, thereby, boosting, the, rise, of, new, artists, also, by, the, late, 1940s, swing, was, no, longer, the, dominant, style, of, jazz, musicians, by, the, 1940s, some, jazz, musicians, were, borrowing, from, classical, music, while, others, such, as, charlie, parker, were, broadening, the, rhythmic, harmonic, and, melodic, vocabulary, of, swing, to, create, bebop, or, bop, the, bebop, recordings, goodman, made, for, capitol, were, praised, by, critics, for, his, bebop, band, he, hired, buddy, greco, zoot, sims, and, wardell, gray, he, consulted, his, friend, mary, lou, williams, for, advice, on, how, to, approach, the, music, of, dizzy, gillespie, and, charlie, parker, pianist, mel, powell, was, also, an, adviser, in, 1945, goodman, enjoyed, bebop, when, he, heard, thelonious, monk, he, said, i, like, it, i, like, that, very, much, i, like, the, piece, and, i, like, the, way, he, played, it, i, think, he, s, got, a, sense, of, humor, and, he, s, got, some, good, things, there, he, also, admired, swedish, clarinetist, stan, hasselg, rd, but, after, playing, with, a, bebop, band, for, over, a, year, he, returned, to, his, swing, band, because, he, concluded, that, was, what, he, knew, best, in, 1953, he, said, maybe, bop, has, done, more, to, set, music, back, for, years, than, anything, basically, it, s, all, wrong, it, s, not, even, knowing, the, scales, bop, was, mostly, publicity, and, people, figuring, angles, 354, in, 1949, he, studied, with, clarinetist, reginald, kell,

earlier, goodman, learned, to, adjust, his, embouchure, to, the, use, of, both, lips, and, even, to, use, new, fingering, techniques, he, had, his, old, finger, calluses, removed, and, started, to, learn, how, to, play, his, clarinet, again, almost, from, scratch, goodman, commissioned, compositions, for, clarinet, and, chamber, ensembles, or, orchestra, that, have, become, standard, pieces, of,
