subordinates, he, turned, over, the, company, to, his, grandson, henry, ford, ii, in, 1945, upon, his, death, in, 1947, he, left, most, of, his, wealth, to, the, ford, foundation, and, control, of,

adept, at, operating, the, westinghouse, portable, steam, engine, he, was, later, hired, by, westinghouse, to, service, their, steam, engines, in, his, farm, workshop, ford, built, a, steam, wagon, or, tractor, and, a, steam, car, but, thought, steam, was, not, suitable, for, light, vehicles, as, the, boiler, was, dangerous, ford, also, said, that, he, did, not, see, the, use, of, experimenting, with, electricity, due, to, the, expense, of, trolley, wires, and, no, storage, battery, was, in, sight, of, a, weight, that, was, practical, in, 1885, ford, repaired, an, otto, engine, and, in, 1887, he, built, a, four, cycle, model, with, a, one, inch, bore, and, a, three, inch, stroke, in, 1890, ford, started, work, on, a, two, cylinder, engine, ford, said, in, 1892, i, completed, my, first, motor, car, powered, by, a, two, cylinder, four, horsepower, motor, with, a, two, and, half, inch, bore, and, a, six, inch, stroke, which, was, connected, to, a, countershaft, by, a, belt, and, then, to, the, rear, wheel, by, a, chain, the, belt, was, shifted, by, a, clutch, lever, to, control, speeds, at, 10, or, 20, miles, per, hour, augmented, by, a, throttle, other, features, included, 28, inch, wire, bicycle, wheels, with, rubber, tires, a, foot, brake, a, 3, gallon, gasoline, tank, and, later, a, water, jacket, around, the, cylinders, for, cooling, ford, added, that, in, the, spring, of, 1893, the, machine, was, running, to, my, partial, satisfaction, and, giving, an, opportunity, further, to, test, out, the, design, and, material, on, the, road, between, 1895, and, 1896, ford, drove, that, machine, about, 1000, miles, he, then, started, a, second, car, in, 1896, eventually, building, three, of, them, in, his, home, workshop, ford, married, clara, jane, bryant, 1866, 1950, on, april, 11, 1888, and, supported, himself, by, farming, and, running, a, sawmill, they, had, one, child, edsel, ford, 1893, 1943, in, 1891, ford, became, an, engineer, with, the, edison, illuminating, company, of, detroit, after, his, promotion, to, chief, engineer, in, 1893, he, had, enough, time, and, money, to, devote, attention, to, his, experiments, on, gasoline, engines, these, experiments, culminated, in, 1896, with, the, completion, of, a, self, propelled, vehicle, which, he, named, the, ford, quadricycle, he, test, drove, it, on, june, 4, after, various, test, drives, ford, brainstormed, ways, to, improve, the, quadricycle, also, in, 1896, ford, attended, a, meeting, of, edison, executives, where, he, was, introduced, to, thomas, edison, edison, approved, of, ford, s, automobile, experimentation, encouraged, by, edison, ford, designed, and, built, a, second, vehicle, completing, it, in, 1898, backed, by, the, capital, of, detroit, lumber, baron, william, h, murphy, ford, resigned, from, the, edison, company, and, founded, the, detroit, automobile, company, on, august, 5, 1899, however, the, automobiles, produced, were, of, a, lower, quality, and, higher, price, than, ford, wanted, ultimately, the, company, was, not, successful, and, was, dissolved, in, january, 1901, with, the, help, of, c, harold, wills, ford, designed, built, and, successfully, raced, a, 26, horsepower, automobile, in, october, 1901, with, this, success, murphy, and, other, stockholders, in, the, detroit, automobile, company, formed, the, henry, ford, company, on, november, 30, 1901, with, ford, as, chief, engineer, in, 1902, murphy, brought, in, henry, m, leland, as, a, consultant, ford, in, response, left, the, company, bearing, his, name, with, ford, gone, leland, renamed, the, company, the, cadillac, automobile, company, teaming, up, with, former, racing, cyclist, tom, cooper, ford, also, produced, the, 80, horsepower, racer, 999, which, barney, oldfield, was, to, drive, to, victory, in, a, race, in, october, 1902, ford, received, the, backing, of, an, old, acquaintance, alexander, y, malcomson, a, detroit, area, coal, dealer, they, formed, a, partnership, ford, malcomson, ltd, to, manufacture, automobiles, ford, went, to, work, designing, an, inexpensive, automobile, and, the, duo, leased, a, factory, and, contracted, with, a, machine, shop, owned, by, john, and, horace, e, dodge, to, supply, over, 160, 000, in, parts, sales, were, slow, and, a, crisis, arose, when, the, dodge, brothers, demanded, payment, for, their, first, shipment, in, response, malcomson, brought, in, another, group, of, investors, and, convinced, the, dodge, brothers, to, accept, a, portion, of, the, new, company, ford, malcomson, was, reincorporated, as, the, ford, motor, company, on, june, 16, 1903, with, 28, 000, capital, the, original, investors, included, ford, and, malcomson, the, dodge, brothers, malcomson, s, uncle, john, s, gray, malcolmson, s, secretary, james, couzens, and, two, of, malcomson, s, lawyers, john, w, anderson, and, horace, rackham, because, of, ford, s, volatility, gray, was, elected, president, of, the, company, ford, then, demonstrated, a, newly, designed, car, on, the, ice, of, lake, st, clair, driving, 1, mile, 1, 6, km, in, 39, 4, seconds, and, setting, a, new, land, speed, record, at, 91, 3, miles, per, hour, 146, 9, kilometres, per, hour, convinced, by, this, success, race, driver, barney, oldfield, who, named, this, new, ford, model, 999, in, honor, of, the, fastest, locomotive, of, the, day, took, the, car, around, the, country, making, the, ford, brand, known, throughout, the, united, states, ford, also, was, one, of, the, early, backers, of, the, indianapolis, 500, in, 1909, ford, submitted, for, patent, application, for, his, invention, for, a, new, transmission, mechanism, it, was, awarded, a, patent, in, 1911, the, model, t, debuted, on, october, 1, 1908, it, had, the, steering, wheel, on, the, left, which, every, other, company, soon, copied, the, entire, engine, and, transmission, were, enclosed, the, four, cylinders, were, cast, in, a, solid, block, the, suspension, used, two, semi, elliptic, springs, the, car, was, very, simple, to, drive, and, easy, and, cheap, to, repair, it, was, so, cheap, at, 825, in, 1908, 27, 980, today, with, the, price, falling, every, year, that, by, the, 1920s, a, majority, of, american, drivers, had, learned, to, drive, on, the, model, t, ford, created, a, huge, publicity, machine, in, detroit, to, ensure, every, newspaper, carried, stories, and, ads, about, the, new, product, ford, s, network, of, local, dealers, made, the, car, ubiquitous, in, almost, every, city, in, north, america, as, independent, dealers, the, franchises, grew, rich, and, publicized, not, just, the, ford, but, also, the, concept, of, automobiling, local, motor, clubs, sprang, up, to, help, new, drivers, and, encourage, them, to, explore, the, countryside, ford, was, always, eager, to, sell, to, farmers, who, looked, at, the, vehicle, as, a, commercial, device, to, help, their, business, sales, skyrocketed, several, years, posted, 100, gains, on, the, previous, year, in, 1913, ford, introduced, moving, assembly, belts, into, his, plants, which, enabled, an, enormous, increase, in, production, although, ford, is, often, credited, with, the, idea, contemporary, sources, indicate, that, the, concept, and, development, came, from, employees, clarence, avery, peter, e, martin, charles, e, sorensen, and, c, harold, wills, see, ford, piquette, avenue, plant, sales, passed, 250, 000, in, 1914, by, 1916, as, the, price, dropped, to, 360, for, the, basic, touring, car, sales, reached, 472, 000, by, 1918, half, of, all, cars, in, the, united, states, were, model, ts, all, new, cars, were, black, as, ford, wrote, in, his, autobiography, any, customer, can, have, a, car, painted, any, color, that, he, wants, so, long, as, it, is, black, until, the, development, of, the, assembly, line, which, mandated, black, because, of, its, quicker, drying, time, model, ts, were, available, in, other, colors, including, red, the, design, was, fervently, promoted, and, defended, by, ford, and, production, continued, as, late, as, 1927, the, final, total, production, was, 15, 007, 034, this, record, stood, for, the, next, 45, years, and, was, achieved, in, 19, years, from, the, introduction, of, the, first, model, t, 1908, henry, ford, turned, the, presidency, of, ford, motor, company, over, to, his, son, edsel, ford, in, december, 1918, henry, retained, final, decision, authority, and, sometimes, reversed, the, decisions, of, his, son, ford, started, another, company, henry, ford, and, son, and, made, a, show, of, taking, himself, and, his, best, employees, to, the, new, company, the, goal, was, to, scare, the, remaining, holdout, stockholders, of, the, ford, motor, company, to, sell, their, stakes, to, him, before, they, lost, most, of, their, value, he, was, determined, to, have, full, control, over, strategic, decisions, the, ruse, worked, and, henry, and, edsel, purchased, all, remaining, stock, from, the, other, investors, thus, giving, the, family, sole, ownership, of, the, company, in, 1922, ford, also, purchased, lincoln, motor, co, founded, by, cadillac, founder, henry, leland, and, his, son, wilfred, during, world, war, i, the, lelands, briefly, stayed, to, manage, the, company, but, were, soon, expelled, from, it, despite, this, acquisition, of, a, premium, car, maker, henry, displayed, relatively, little, enthusiasm, for, luxury, automobiles, in, contrast, to, edsel, who, actively, sought, to, expand, ford, into, the, upscale, market, the, original, lincoln, model, l, that, the, lelands, had, introduced, in, 1920, was, also, kept, in, production, untouched, for, a, decade, until, it, became, too, outdated, it, was, replaced, by, the, modernized, model, k, in, 1931, by, the, mid, 1920s, general, motors, was, rapidly, rising, as, the, leading, american, automobile, manufacturer, gm, president, alfred, sloan, established, the, company, s, price, ladder, whereby, gm, would, offer, an, automobile, for, every, purse, and, purpose, in, contrast, to, ford, s, lack, of, interest, in, anything, outside, the, low, end, market, although, henry, ford, was, against, replacing, the, model, t, now, 16, years, old, chevrolet, was, mounting, a, bold, new, challenge, as, gm, s, entry, level, division, in, the, company, s, price, ladder, ford, also, resisted, the, increasingly, popular, idea, of, payment, plans, for, cars, with, model, t, sales, starting, to, slide, ford, was, forced, to, relent, and, approve, work, on, a, successor, model, shutting, down, production, for, 18, months, during, this, time, ford, constructed, a, massive, new, assembly, plant, at, river, rouge, for, the, new, model, a, which, launched, in, 1927, in, addition, to, its, price, ladder, gm, also, quickly, established, itself, at, the, forefront, of, automotive, styling, under, harley, earl, s, arts, color, department, another, area, of, automobile, design, that, henry, ford, did, not, entirely, appreciate, or, understand, ford, would, not, have, a, true, equivalent, of, the, gm, styling, department, for, many, years, by, 1926, flagging, sales, of, the, model, t, finally, convinced, ford, to, make, a, new, model, he, pursued, the, project, with, a, great, deal, of, interest, in, the, design, of, the, engine, chassis, and, other, mechanical, necessities, while, leaving, the, body, design, to, his, son, although, ford, fancied, himself, an, engineering, genius, he, had, little, formal, training, in, mechanical, engineering, and, could, not, even, read, a, blueprint, a, talented, team, of, engineers, performed, most, of, the, actual, work, of, designing, the, model, a, and, later, the, flathead, v8, with, ford, supervising, them, closely, and, giving, them, overall, direction, edsel, also, managed, to, prevail, over, his, father, s, initial, objections, in, the, inclusion, of, a, sliding, shift, transmission, the, result, was, the, ford, model, a, introduced, in, december, 1927, and, produced, through, 1931, with, a, total, output, of, more, than, four, million, subsequently, the, ford, company, adopted, an, annual, model, change, system, similar, to, that, recently, pioneered, by, its, competitor, general, motors, and, still, in, use, by, automakers, today, not, until, the, 1930s, did, ford, overcome, his, objection, to, finance, companies, and, the, ford, owned, universal, credit, corporation, became, a, major, car, financing, operation, henry, ford, still, resisted, many, technological, innovations, such, as, hydraulic, brakes, and, all, metal, roofs, which, ford, vehicles, did, not, adopt, until, 1935, 36, for, 1932, however, ford, dropped, a, bombshell, with, the, flathead, ford, v8, the, first, low, price, eight, cylinder, engine, the, flathead, v8, variants, of, which, were, used, in, ford, vehicles, for, 20, years, was, the, result, of, a, secret, project, launched, in, 1930, and, henry, had, initially, considered, a, radical, x, 8, engine, before, agreeing, to, a, conventional, design, it, gave, ford, a, reputation, as, a, performance, make, well, suited, for, hot, rodding, ford, did, not, believe, in, accountants, he, amassed, one, of, the, world, s, largest, fortunes, without, ever, having, his, company, audited, under, his, administration, without, an, accounting, department, ford, had, no, way, of, knowing, exactly, how, much, money, was, being, taken, in, and, spent, each, month, and, the, company, s, bills, and, invoices, were, reportedly, guessed, at, by, weighing, them, on, a, scale, not, until, 1956, would, ford, be, a, publicly, traded, company, also, at, edsel, s, insistence, ford, launched, mercury, in, 1939, as, a, mid, range, make, to, challenge, dodge, and, buick, although, henry, also, displayed, relatively, little, enthusiasm, for, it, ford, was, a, pioneer, of, welfare, capitalism, designed, to, improve, the, lot, of, his, workers, and, especially, to, reduce, the, heavy, turnover, that, had, many, departments, hiring, 300, men, per, year, to, fill, 100, slots, efficiency, meant, hiring, and, keeping, the, best, workers, ford, astonished, the, world, in, 1914, by, offering, a, 5, daily, wage, 152, in, 2023, which, more, than, doubled, the, rate, of, most, of, his, workers, a, cleveland, ohio, newspaper, editorialized, that, the, announcement, shot, like, a, blinding, rocket, through, the, dark, clouds, of, the, present, industrial, depression, the, move, proved, extremely, profitable, instead, of, constant, employee, turnover, the, best, mechanics, in, detroit, flocked, to, ford, bringing, their, human, capital, and, expertise, raising, productivity, and, lowering, training, costs, ford, announced, his, 5, per, day, program, on, january, 5, 1914, raising, the, minimum, daily, pay, from, 2, 34, to, 5, for, qualifying, male, workers, detroit, was, already, a, high, wage, city, but, competitors, were, forced, to, raise, wages, or, lose, their, best, workers, ford, s, policy, proved, that, paying, employees, more, would, enable, them, to, afford, the, cars, they, were, producing, and, thus, boost, the, local, economy, he, viewed, the, increased, wages, as, profit, sharing, linked, with, rewarding, those, who, were, most, productive, and, of, good, character, it, may, have, been, couzens, who, convinced, ford, to, adopt, the, 5, day, wage, real, profit, sharing, was, offered, to, employees, who, had, worked, at, the, company, for, six, months, or, more, and, importantly, conducted, their, lives, in, a, manner, of, which, ford, s, social, department, approved, they, frowned, on, heavy, drinking, gambling, and, on, what, are, now, called, deadbeat, dads, the, social, department, used, 50, investigators, and, support, staff, to, maintain, employee, standards, a, large, percentage, of, workers, were, able, to, qualify, for, this, profit, sharing, ford, s, incursion, into, his, employees, private, lives, was, highly, controversial, and, he, soon, backed, off, from, the, most, intrusive, aspects, by, the, time, he, wrote, his, 1922, memoir, he, had, spoken, of, the, social, department, and, the, private, conditions, for, profit, sharing, in, the, past, tense, he, admitted, that, paternalism, has, no, place, in, the, industry, welfare, work, that, consists, in, prying, into, employees, private, concerns, is, out, of, date, men, need, counsel, and, men, need, help, often, special, help, and, all, this, ought, to, be, rendered, for, decency, s, sake, but, the, broad, workable, plan, of, investment, and, participation, will, do, more, to, solidify, the, industry, and, strengthen, the, organization, than, will, any, social, work, on, the, outside, without, changing, the, principle, we, have, changed, the, method, of, payment, in, addition, to, raising, his, workers, wages, ford, also, introduced, a, new, reduced, workweek, in, 1926, the, decision, was, made, in, 1922, when, ford, and, crowther, described, it, as, six, 8, hour, days, giving, a, 48, hour, week, but, in, 1926, it, was, announced, as, five, 8, hour, days, giving, a, 40, hour, week, the, program, apparently, started, with, saturday, being, designated, a, workday, before, becoming, a, day, off, sometime, later, on, may, 1, 1926, the, ford, motor, company, s, factory, workers, switched, to, a, five, day, 40, hour, workweek, with, the, company, s, office, workers, making, the, transition, the, following, august, ford, had, decided, to, boost, productivity, as, workers, were, expected, to, put, more, effort, into, their, work, in, exchange, for, more, leisure, time, ford, also, believed, decent, leisure, time, was, good, for, business, giving, workers, additional, time, to, purchase, and, consume, more, goods, however, charitable, concerns, also, played, a, role, ford, explained, it, is, high, time, to, rid, ourselves, of, the, notion, that, leisure, for, workmen, is, either, lost, time, or, a, class, privilege, ford, was, adamantly, against, labor, unions, he, explained, his, views, on, unions, in, chapter, 18, of, my, life, and, work, he, thought, they, were, too, heavily, influenced, by, leaders, who, would, end, up, doing, more, harm, than, good, for, workers, despite, their, ostensible, good, motives, most, wanted, to, restrict, productivity, as, a, means, to, foster, employment, but, ford, saw, this, as, self, defeating, because, in, his, view, productivity, was, necessary, for, economic, prosperity, to, exist, he, believed, that, productivity, gains, that, obviated, certain, jobs, would, nevertheless, stimulate, the, broader, economy, and, grow, new, jobs, elsewhere, whether, within, the, same, corporation, or, in, others, ford, also, believed, that, union, leaders, had, a, perverse, incentive, to, foment, perpetual, socio, economic, crises, to, maintain, their, power, meanwhile, he, believed, that, smart, managers, had, an, incentive, to, do, right, by, their, workers, because, doing, so, would, maximize, their, profits, however, ford, did, acknowledge, that, many, managers, were, basically, too, bad, at, managing, to, understand, this, fact, but, ford, believed, that, eventually, if, good, managers, such, as, he, could, fend, off, the, attacks, of, misguided, people, from, both, left, and, right, i, e, both, socialists, and, bad, manager, reactionaries, the, good, managers, would, create, a, socio, economic, system, wherein, neither, bad, management, nor, bad, unions, could, find, enough, support, to, continue, existing, to, forestall, union, activity, ford, promoted, harry,

becoming, known, as, the, battle, of, the, overpass, in, the, late, 1930s, and, early, 1940s, edsel, who, was, president, of, the, company, thought, ford, had, to, come, to, a, collective, bargaining, agreement, with, the, unions, because, the, violence, work, disruptions, and, bitter, stalemates, could, not, go, on, forever, but, ford, who, still, had, the, final, veto, in, the, company, on, a, de, facto, basis, even, if, not, an, official, one, refused, to, cooperate, for, several, years, he, kept, bennett, in, charge, of, talking, to, the, unions, trying, to, organize, the, ford, motor, company, sorensen, s, memoir, makes, clear, that, ford, s, purpose, in, putting, bennett, in, charge, was, to, make, sure, no, agreements, were, ever, reached, the, ford, motor, company, was, the, last, detroit, automaker, to, recognize, the, uaw, despite, pressure, from, the, rest, of, the, u, s, automotive, industry, and, even, the, u, s, government, a, sit, down, strike, by, the, uaw, union, in, april, 1941, closed, the, river, rouge, plant, sorensen, recounted, that, a, distraught, henry, ford, was, very, close, to, following, through, with, a, threat, to, break, up, the, company, rather, than, cooperate, still, his, wife, clara, told, him, she, would, leave, him, if, he, destroyed, the, family, business, in, her, view, it, would, not, be, worth, the, chaos, it, would, create, ford, complied, with, his, wife, s, ultimatum, and, even, agreed, with, her, in, retrospect, overnight, the, ford, motor, company, went, from, the, most, stubborn, holdout, among, automakers, to, the, one, with, the, most, favorable, uaw, contract, terms, the, contract, was, signed, in, june, 1941, about, a, year, later, ford, told, walter, reuther, it, was, one, of, the, most, sensible, things, harry, bennett, ever, did, when, he, got, the, uaw, into, this, plant, reuther, inquired, what, do, you, mean, ford, replied, well, you, ve, been, fighting, general, motors, and, the, wall, street, crowd, now, you, re, in, here, and, we, ve, given, you, a, union, shop, and, more, than, you, got, out, of, them, that, puts, you, on, our, side, doesn, t, it, we, can, fight, general, motors, and, wall, street, together, eh, like, other, automobile, companies, ford, entered, the, aviation, business, during, world, war, i, building, liberty, engines, after, the, war, it, returned, to, auto, manufacturing, until, 1925, when, ford, acquired, the, stout, metal, airplane, company, ford, s, most, successful, aircraft, was, the, ford, 4at, trimotor, often, called, the, tin, goose, because, of, its, corrugated, metal, construction, it, used, a, new, alloy, called, alclad, that, combined, the, corrosion, resistance, of, aluminum, with, the, strength, of, duralumin, the, plane, was, similar, to, fokker, s, v, vii, 3m, the, trimotor, first, flew, on, june, 11, 1926, and, was, the, first, successful, u, s, passenger, airliner, accommodating, about, 12, passengers, in, a, rather, uncomfortable, fashion, several, variants, were, also, used, by, the, u, s, army, the, smithsonian, institution, has, honored, ford, for, changing, the, aviation, industry, 199, trimotors, were, built, before, it, was, discontinued, in, 1933, when, the, ford, airplane, division, shut, down, because, of, poor, sales, during, the, great, depression, in, 1985, ford, was, posthumously, inducted, into, the, national, aviation, hall, of, fame, for, his, impact, on, the, industry, ford, opposed, war, which, he, viewed, as, a, terrible, waste, and, supported, causes, that, opposed, military, intervention, ford, became, highly, critical, of, those, who, he, felt, financed, war, and, he, tried, to, stop, them, in, 1915, the, pacifist, rosika, schwimmer, gained, favor, with, ford, who, agreed, to, fund, a, peace, ship, to, europe, where, world, war, i, was, raging, he, led, 170, other, peace, activists, ford, s, episcopalian, pastor, reverend, samuel, s, marquis, accompanied, him, on, the, mission, marquis, headed, ford, s, sociology, department, from, 1913, to, 1921, ford, talked, to, president, woodrow, wilson, about, the, mission, but, had, no, government, support, his, group, went, to, neutral, sweden, and, the, netherlands, to, meet, with, peace, activists, a, target, of, much, ridicule, ford, left, the, ship, as, soon, as, it, reached, sweden, in, 1915, ford, blamed, german, jewish, bankers, for, instigating, the, war, according, to, biographer, steven, watts, ford, s, status, as, a, leading, industrialist, gave, him, a, worldview, that, warfare, was, wasteful, folly, that, retarded, long, term, economic, growth, the, losing, side, in, the, war, typically, suffered, heavy, damage, small, business, were, especially, hurt, for, it, takes, years, to, recuperate, he, argued, in, many, newspaper, articles, that, a, focus, on, business, efficiency, would, discourage, warfare, because, if, every, man, who, manufactures, an, article, would, make, the, very, best, he, can, in, the, very, best, way, at, the, very, lowest, possible, price, the, world, would, be, kept, out, of, war, for, commercialists, would, not, have, to, search, for, outside, markets, which, the, other, fellow, covets, ford, admitted, that, munitions, makers, enjoyed, wars, but, he, argued, the, most, businesses, wanted, to, avoid, wars, and, instead, work, to, manufacture, and, sell, useful, goods, hire, workers, and, generate, steady, long, term, profits, ford, s, british, factories, produced, fordson, tractors, to, increase, the, british, food, supply, as, well, as, trucks, and, warplane, engines, when, the, u, s, entered, the, war, in, 1917, ford, went, quiet, on, foreign, policy, his, company, became, a, major, supplier, of, weapons, especially, the, liberty, engine, for, warplanes, and, anti, submarine, boats, 95, 100, 119, in, 1918, with, the, war, on, and, the, league, of, nations, a, growing, issue, in, global, politics, president, woodrow, wilson, a, democrat, encouraged, ford, to, run, for, a, michigan, seat, in, the, u, s, senate, wilson, believed, that, ford, could, tip, the, scales, in, congress, in, favor, of, wilson, s, proposed, league, you, are, the, only, man, in, michigan, who, can, be, elected, and, help, bring, about, the, peace, you, so, desire, the, president, wrote, ford, ford, wrote, back, if, they, want, to, elect, me, let, them, do, so, but, i, won, t, make, a, penny, s, investment, ford, did, run, however, and, came, within, 7, 000, votes, of, winning, out, of, more, than, 400, 000, cast, statewide, he, was, defeated, in, a, close, election, by, the, republican, candidate, truman, newberry, a, former, united, states, secretary, of, the, navy, ford, remained, a, staunch, wilsonian, and, supporter, of, the, league, when, wilson, made, a, major, speaking, tour, in, the, summer, of, 1919, to, promote, the, league, ford, helped, fund, the, attendant, publicity, ford, opposed, the, united, states, entry, into, world, war, ii, and, continued, to, believe, that, international, business, could, generate, the, prosperity, that, would, head, off, wars, ford, insisted, that, war, was, the, product, of, greedy, financiers, who, sought, profit, in, human, destruction, in, 1939, he, went, so, far, as, to, claim, that, the, torpedoing, of, u, s, merchant, ships, by, german, submarines, was, the, result, of, conspiratorial, activities, undertaken, by, financier, war, makers, the, financiers, to, whom, he, was, referring, was, ford, s, code, for, jews, he, had, also, accused, jews, of, fomenting, the, first, world, war, in, the, run, up, to, world, war, ii, and, when, the, war, erupted, in, 1939, he, reported, that, he, did, not, want, to, trade, with, belligerents, like, many, other, businessmen, of, the, great, depression, era, he, never, liked, or, entirely, trusted, the, franklin, roosevelt, administration, and, thought, roosevelt, was, inching, the, u, s, closer, to, war, ford, continued, to, do, business, with, nazi, germany, including, the, manufacture, of, war, materiel, however, he, also, agreed, to, build, warplane, engines, for, the, british, government, in, early, 1940, he, boasted, that, ford, motor, company, would, soon, be, able, to, produce, 1, 000, u, s, warplanes, a, day, even, though, it, did, not, have, an, aircraft, production, facility, at, that, time, 430, ford, was, a, prominent, early, member, of, the, america, first, committee, against, world, war, ii, involvement, but, was, forced, to, resign, from, its, executive, board, when, his, involvement, proved, too, controversial, beginning, in, 1940, with, the, requisitioning, of, between, 100, and, 200, french, pows, to, work, as, slave, laborers, ford, werke, contravened, article, 31, of, the, 1929, geneva, convention, when, rolls, royce, sought, a, u, s, manufacturer, as, an, additional, source, for, the, merlin, engine, as, fitted, to, spitfire, and, hurricane, fighters, ford, first, agreed, to, do, so, and, then, reneged, he, lined, up, behind, the, war, effort, when, the, u, s, entered, in, december, 1941, before, the, u, s, entered, the, war, responding, to, president, roosevelt, s, call, in, december, 1940, for, the, great, arsenal, of, democracy, ford, directed, the, ford, motor, company, to, construct, a, vast, new, purpose, built, aircraft, factory, at, willow, run, near, detroit, michigan, ford, broke, ground, on, willow, run, in, the, spring, of, 1941, b, 24, component, production, began, in, may, 1942, and, the, first, complete, b, 24, came, off, the, line, in, october, 1942, at, 3, 500, 000, sq, ft, 330, 000, m, 2, it, was, the, largest, assembly, line, in, the, world, at, the, time, at, its, peak, in, 1944, the, willow, run, plant, produced, 650, b, 24s, per, month, and, by, 1945, ford, was, completing, each, b, 24, in, eighteen, hours, with, one, rolling, off, the, assembly, line, every, 58, minutes, ford, produced, 9, 000, b, 24s, at, willow, run, half, of, the, 18, 000, total, b, 24s, produced, during, the, war, 430, when, edsel, ford, died, of, cancer, in, 1943, at, age, 49, henry, ford, nominally, resumed, control, of, the, company, but, a, series, of, strokes, in, the, late, 1930s, had, left, him, increasingly, debilitated, and, his, mental, ability, was, fading, ford, was, increasingly, sidelined, and, others, made, decisions, in, his, name, the, company, was, controlled, by, a, handful, of, senior, executives, led, by, charles, sorensen, an, important, engineer, and, production, executive, at, ford, and, harry, bennett, the, chief, of, ford, s, service, unit, ford, s, paramilitary, force, that, spied, on, and, enforced, discipline, upon, ford, employees, ford, grew, jealous, of, the, publicity, sorensen, received, and, forced, sorensen, out, in, 1944, ford, s, incompetence, led, to, discussions, in, washington, about, how, to, restore, the, company, whether, by, wartime, government, fiat, or, by, instigating, a, coup, among, executives, and, directors, nothing, happened, until, 1945, when, with, bankruptcy, a, serious, risk, ford, s, wife, clara, and, edsel, s, widow, eleanor, confronted, him, and, demanded, he, cede, control, of, the, company, to, his, grandson, henry, ford, ii, they, threatened, to, sell, off, their, stock, which, amounted, to, three, quarters, of, the, company, s, total, shares, if, he, refused, ford, was, reportedly, infuriated, but, he, had, no, choice, but, to, give, in, the, young, man, took, over, and, as, his, first, act, of, business, fired, harry, bennett, ford, was, a, conspiracy, theorist, who, drew, on, a, long, tradition, of, false, allegations, against, jews, ford, claimed, that, jewish, internationalism, posed, a, threat, to, traditional, american, values, which, he, deeply, believed, were, at, risk, in, the, modern, world, part, of, his, racist, and, antisemitic, legacy, includes, the, funding, of, square, dancing, in, american, schools, because, he, hated, jazz, and, associated, its, creation, with, jewish, people, in, 1920, ford, wrote, if, fans, wish, to, know, the, trouble, with, american, baseball, they, have, it, in, three, words, too, much, jew, in, 1918, ford, purchased, his, hometown, newspaper, the, dearborn, independent, a, year, and, a, half, later, ford, began, publishing, a, series, of, articles, in, the, paper, under, his, own, name, claiming, a, vast, jewish, conspiracy, was, affecting, america, the, series, ran, in, 91, issues, every, ford, dealership, nationwide, was, required, to, carry, the, paper, and, distribute, it, to, its, customers, ford, later, bound, the, articles, into, four, volumes, entitled, the, international, jew, the, world, s, foremost, problem, which, was, translated, into, multiple, languages, and, distributed, widely, across, the, us, and, europe, the, international, jew, blamed, nearly, all, the, troubles, it, saw, in, american, society, on, jews, the, independent, ran, for, eight, years, from, 1920, until, 1927, with, around, 700, 000, readers, of, his, newspaper, ford, emerged, as, a, spokesman, for, right, wing, extremism, and, religious, prejudice, in, germany, ford, s, the, international, jew, the, world, s, foremost, problem, was, published, by, theodor, fritsch, founder, of, several, antisemitic, parties, and, a, member, of, the, reichstag, in, a, letter, written, in, 1924, heinrich, himmler, described, ford, as, one, of, our, most, valuable, important, and, witty, fighters, ford, is, the, only, american, mentioned, favorably, in, hitler, s, autobiography, mein, kampf, adolf, hitler, wrote, only, a, single, great, man, ford, to, fury, still, maintains, full, independence, the, controlling, masters, of, the, producers, in, a, nation, of, one, hundred, and, twenty, millions, speaking, in, 1931, to, a, detroit, news, reporter, hitler, said, i, regard, henry, ford, as, my, inspiration, explaining, his, reason, for, keeping, a, life, size, portrait, of, ford, behind, his, desk, steven, watts, wrote, that, hitler, revered, ford, proclaiming, that, i, shall, do, my, best, to, put, his, theories, into, practice, in, germany, and, modeling, the, volkswagen, beetle, the, people, s, car, on, the, model, t, max, wallace, has, stated, history, records, that, adolf, hitler, was, an, ardent, anti, semite, before, he, ever, read, ford, s, the, international, jew, ford, also, paid, to, print, and, distribute, 500, 000, copies, of, the, antisemitic, fabricated, text, the, protocols, of, the, elders, of, zion, historians, say, hitler, distributed, ford, s, books, and, articles, throughout, germany, stoking, the, hatred, that, helped, fuel, the, holocaust, on, february, 1, 1924, ford, received, kurt, ludecke, a, representative, of, hitler, at, home, ludecke, was, introduced, to, ford, by, siegfried, wagner, son, of, the, composer, richard, wagner, and, his, wife, winifred, both, nazi, sympathizers, and, antisemites, ludecke, asked, ford, for, a, contribution, to, the, nazi, cause, but, was, apparently, refused, ford, did, however, give, considerable, sums, of, money, to, boris, brasol, a, member, of, the, aufbau, vereinigung, an, organization, linking, german, nazis, and, white, russian, emigrants, which, also, financed, the, nazi, party, ford, s, articles, were, denounced, by, the, anti, defamation, league, adl, while, these, articles, explicitly, condemned, pogroms, and, violence, against, jews, they, blamed, the, jews, themselves, for, provoking, them, according, to, some, trial, testimony, none, of, this, work, was, written, by, ford, but, he, allowed, his, name, to, be, used, as, an, author, friends, and, business, associates, said, they, warned, ford, about, the, contents, of, the, independent, and, that, he, probably, never, read, the, articles, he, claimed, he, only, read, the, headlines, on, the, other, hand, court, testimony, in, a, libel, suit, brought, by, one, of, the, targets, of, the, newspaper, alleged, that, ford, did, know, about, the, contents, of, the, independent, in, advance, of, publication, a, libel, lawsuit, was, brought, by, san, francisco, lawyer, and, jewish, farm, cooperative, organizer, aaron, sapiro, in, response, to, the, antisemitic, remarks, and, led, ford, to, close, the, independent, in, december, 1927, news, reports, at, the, time, quoted, him, as, saying, he, was, shocked, by, the, content, and, unaware, of, its, nature, during, the, trial, the, editor, of, ford, s, own, page, william, cameron, testified, that, ford, had, nothing, to, do, with, the, editorials, even, though, they, were, under, his, byline, cameron, testified, at, the, libel, trial, that, he, never, discussed, the, content, of, the, pages, or, sent, them, to, ford, for, his, approval, investigative, journalist, max, wallace, noted, that, whatever, credibility, this, absurd, claim, may, have, had, was, soon, undermined, when, james, m, miller, a, former, dearborn, independent, employee, swore, under, oath, that, ford, had, told, him, he, intended, to, expose, sapiro, michael, barkun, observed, that, cameron, would, have, continued, to, publish, such, anti, semitic, material, without, ford, s, explicit, instructions, seemed, unthinkable, to, those, who, knew, both, men, mrs, stanley, ruddiman, a, ford, family, intimate, remarked, that, i, don, t, think, mr, cameron, ever, wrote, anything, for, publication, without, mr, ford, s, approval, according, to, spencer, blakeslee, he, adl, mobilized, prominent, jews, and, non, jews, to, publicly, oppose, ford, s, message, they, formed, a, coalition, of, jewish, groups, for, the, same, purpose, and, raised, constant, objections, in, the, detroit, press, before, leaving, his, presidency, early, in, 1921, woodrow, wilson, joined, other, leading, americans, in, a, statement, that, rebuked, ford, and, others, for, their, antisemitic, campaign, a, boycott, against, ford, products, by, jews, and, liberal, christians, also, had, an, impact, and, ford, shut, down, the, paper, in, 1927, recanting, his, views, in, a, public, letter, to, sigmund, livingston, president, of, the, adl, wallace, also, found, that, ford, s, apology, was, likely, or, at, least, partly, motivated, by, a, business, that, was, slumping, as, a, result, of, his, antisemitism, repelling, potential, buyers, of, ford, cars, up, until, the, apology, a, considerable, number, of, dealers, who, had, been, required, to, make, sure, that, buyers, of, ford, cars, received, the, independent, bought, up, and, destroyed, copies, of, the, newspaper, rather, than, alienate, customers, ford, s, 1927, apology, was, well, received, four, fifths, of, the, hundreds, of, letters, addressed, to, ford, in, july, 1927, were, from, jews, and, almost, without, exception, they, praised, the, industrialist, in, january, 1937, a, ford, statement, to, the, detroit, jewish, chronicle, disavowed, any, connection, whatsoever, with, the, publication, in, germany, of, a, book, known, as, the, international, jew, ford, however, allegedly, never, signed, the, retraction, and, apology, which, were, written, by, others, rather, his, signature, was, forged, by, harry, bennett, and, ford, never, actually, recanted, his, antisemitic, views, stating, in, 1940, i, hope, to, republish, the, international, jew, again, some, time, in, july, 1938, the, german, consul, in, cleveland, gave, ford, on, his, 75th, birthday, the, award, of, the, grand, cross, of, the, german, eagle, the, highest, medal, nazi, germany, could, bestow, on, a, foreigner, james, d, mooney, vice, president, of, overseas, operations, for, general, motors, received, a, similar, medal, the, merit, cross, of, the, german, eagle, first, class, on, january, 7, 1942, ford, wrote, another, letter, to, sigmund, livingston, disclaiming, direct, or, indirect, support, of, any, agitation, which, would, promote, antagonism, toward, my, jewish, fellow, citizens, he, concluded, the, letter, with, my, sincere, hope, that, now, in, this, country, and, throughout, the, world, when, the, war, is, finished, hatred, of, the, jews, and, hatred, against, any, other, racial, or, religious, groups, shall, cease, for, all, time, the, distribution, of, the, international, jew, was, halted, in, 1942, through, legal, action, by, ford, despite, complications, from, a, lack, of, copyright, it, is, still, banned, in, germany, extremist, groups, often, recycle, the, material, it, still, appears, on, antisemitic, and, neo, nazi, websites, testifying, at, nuremberg, convicted, hitler, youth, leader, baldur, von, schirach, who, in, his, role, as, gauleiter, of, vienna, deported, 65, 000, jews, to, camps, in, poland, stated, the, decisive, anti, semitic, book, i, was, reading, and, the, book, that, influenced, my, comrades, was, that, book, by, henry, ford, the, international, jew, i, read, it, and, became, anti, semitic, the, book, made, a, great, influence, on, myself, and, my, friends, because, we, saw, in, henry, ford, the, representative, of, success, and, also, the, representative, of, a, progressive, social, policy, robert, lacey, wrote, in, ford, the, men, and, the, machines, that, a, close, willow, run, associate, of, ford, reported, that, when, he, was, shown, newsreel, footage, of, the, nazi, concentration, camps, he, was, confronted, with, the, atrocities, which, finally, and, unanswerably, laid, bare, the, bestiality, of, the, prejudice, to, which, he, contributed, he, collapsed, with, a, stroke, his, last, and, most, serious, ford, had, suffered, previous, strokes, and, his, final, cerebral, hemorrhage, occurred, in, 1947, at, age, 83, ford, s, philosophy, was, one, of, economic, independence, for, the, united, states, his, river, rouge, plant, became, the, world, s, largest, industrial, complex, pursuing, vertical, integration, to, such, an, extent, that, it, could, produce, its, own, steel, ford, s, goal, was, to, produce, a, vehicle, from, scratch, without, reliance, on, foreign, trade, he, believed, in, the, global, expansion, of, his, company, he, believed, that, international, trade, and, cooperation, led, to, international, peace, and, he, used, the, assembly, line, process, and, production, of, the, model, t, to, demonstrate, it, he, opened, ford, assembly, plants, in, britain, and, canada, in, 1911, and, soon, became, the, biggest, automotive, producer, in, those, countries, in, 1912, ford, cooperated, with, giovanni, agnelli, of, fiat, to, launch, the, first, italian, automotive, assembly, plants, the, first, plants, in, germany, were, built, in, the, 1920s, with, the, encouragement, of, herbert, hoover, and, the, commerce, department, which, agreed, with, ford, s, theory, that, international, trade, was, essential, to, world, peace, and, reduced, the, chance, of, war, in, the, 1920s, ford, also, opened, plants, in, australia, france, india, and, mexico, and, by, 1929, he, had, successful, dealerships, on, six, continents, ford, experimented, with, a, commercial, rubber, plantation, in, the, amazon, jungle, called, fordl, ndia, it, failed, in, 1929, ford, made, an, agreement, with, the, soviets, to, provide, technical, aid, over, nine, years, in, building, the, first, soviet, automobile, plant, gaz, near, nizhny, novgorod, gorky, an, additional, contract, for, construction, of, the, plant, was, signed, with, the, austin, company, on, august, 23, 1929, the, contract, involved, the, purchase, of, 30, 000, 000, worth, of, knocked, down, ford, cars, and, trucks, for, assembly, during, the, first, four, years, of, the, plant, s, operation, after, which, the, plant, would, gradually, switch, to, soviet, made, components, ford, sent, his, engineers, and, technicians, to, the, soviet, union, to, help, install, the, equipment, and, train, the, workforce, while, over, a, hundred, soviet, engineers, and, technicians, were, stationed, at, ford, s, plants, in, detroit, and, dearborn, for, the, purpose, of, learning, the, methods, and, practice, of, manufacture, and, assembly, in, the, company, s, plants, said, ford, no, matter, where, industry, prospers, whether, in, india, or, china, or, russia, the, more, profit, there, will, be, for, everyone, including, us, all, the, world, is, bound, to, catch, some, good, from, it, by, 1932, ford, was, manufacturing, one, third, of, the, world, s, automobiles, it, set, up, numerous, subsidiaries, that, sold, or, assembled, the, ford, cars, and, trucks, ford, s, image, transfixed, europeans, especially, the, germans, arousing, the, fear, of, some, the, infatuation, of, others, and, the, fascination, among, all, germans, who, discussed, fordism, often, believed, that, it, represented, something, quintessentially, american, they, saw, the, size, tempo, standardization, and, philosophy, of, production, demonstrated, at, the, ford, works, as, a, national, service, an, american, thing, that, represented, the, culture, of, the, united, states, both, supporters, and, critics, insisted, that, fordism, epitomized, american, capitalist, development, and, that, the, auto, industry, was, the, key, to, understanding, economic, and, social, relations, in, the, united, states, as, one, german, explained, automobiles, have, so, completely, changed, the, american, s, mode, of, life, that, today, one, can, hardly, imagine, being, without, a, car, it, is, difficult, to, remember, what, life, was, like, before, mr, ford, began, preaching, his, doctrine, of, salvation, for, many, germans, ford, embodied, the, essence, of, successful, americanism, in, my, life, and, work, ford, predicted, that, if, greed, racism, and, short, sightedness, could, be, overcome, then, economic, and, technological, development, throughout, the, world, would, progress, to, the, point, that, international, trade, would, no, longer, be, based, on, what, today, would, be, called, colonial, or, neocolonial, models, and, would, truly, benefit, all, peoples, ford, maintained, an, interest, in, auto, racing, from, 1901, to, 1913, and, began, his, involvement, in, the, sport, as, both, a, constructor, and, a, driver, later, turning, the, wheel, over, to, hired, drivers, on, october, 10, 1901, he, defeated, alexander, winton, in, a, race, car, named, sweepstakes, it, was, through, the, wins, of, this, car, that, ford, created, the, henry, ford, company, ford, entered, stripped, down, model, ts, in, races, finishing, first, although, later, disqualified, in, an, ocean, to, ocean, across, the, united, states, race, in, 1909, and, setting, a, one, mile, 1, 6, km, oval, speed, record, at, detroit, fairgrounds, in, 1911, with, driver, frank, kulick, in, 1913, he, attempted, to, enter, a, reworked, model, t, in, the, indianapolis, 500, but, was, told, rules, required, the, addition, of, another, 1, 000, pounds, 450, kg, to, the, car, before, it, could, qualify, ford, dropped, out, of, the, race, and, soon, thereafter, exited, racing, permanently, citing, dissatisfaction, with, the, sport, s, rules, demands, on, his, time, by, the, booming, production, of, the, model, t, and, his, low, opinion, of, racing, as, a, worthwhile, activity, in, my, life, and, work, ford, speaks, briefly, of, racing, in, a, rather, dismissive, tone, as, something, that, is, not, at, all, a, good, measure, of, automobiles, in, general, he, describes, himself, as, someone, who, raced, only, because, in, the, 1890s, through, 1910s, one, had, to, race, because, prevailing, ignorance, held, that, racing, was, the, way, to, prove, the, worth, of, an, automobile, ford, did, not, agree, but, he, was, determined, that, as, long, as, this, was, the, definition, of, success, flawed, though, the, definition, was, then, his, cars, would, be, the, best, that, there, were, at, racing, throughout, the, book, he, continually, returns, to, ideals, such, as, transportation, production, efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel, efficiency, economic, prosperity, and, the, automation, of, drudgery, in, farming, and, industry, but, rarely, mentions, and, rather, belittles, the, idea, of, merely, going, fast, from, point, a, to, point, b, nevertheless, ford, did, make, quite, an, impact, on, auto, racing, during, his, racing, years, and, he, was, inducted, into, the, motorsports, hall, of, fame, of, america, in, 1996, when, edsel, ford, president, of, ford, motor, company, died, of, cancer, in, may, 1943, the, elderly, and, ailing, henry, ford, decided, to, assume, the, presidency, by, this, point, ford, nearing, 80, had, several, cardiovascular, events, variously, cited, as, heart, attacks, or, strokes, and, was, mentally, inconsistent, suspicious, and, generally, no, longer, fit, for, such, immense, responsibilities, most, of, the, directors, did, not, want, to, see, him, as, president, but, for, the, previous, 20, years, though, he, had, long, been, without, any, official, executive, title, he, had, always, had, de, facto, control, over, the, company, the, board, and, the, management, had, never, seriously, defied, him, and, this, time, was, no, different, the, directors, elected, him, and, he, served, until, the, end, of, the, war, during, this, period, the, company, began, to, decline, losing, more, than, 10, million, a, month, 176, 080, 000, today, the, administration, of, president, franklin, roosevelt, had, been, considering, a, government, takeover, of, the, company, in, order, to, ensure, continued, war, production, but, the, idea, never, progressed, his, health, failing, ford, ceded, the, company, presidency, to, his, grandson, henry, ford, ii, in, september, 1945, and, retired, he, died, on, april, 7, 1947, of, a, cerebral, hemorrhage, at, fair, lane, his, estate, in, dearborn, at, the, age, of, 83, a, public, viewing, was, held, at, greenfield, village, where, up, to, 5, 000, people, per, hour, filed, past, the, casket, funeral, services, were, held, in, detroit, s, cathedral, church, of, st, paul, and, he, was, buried, in, the, ford, cemetery, in, detroit, a, compendium, of, short, biographies, of, famous, freemasons, published, by, a, freemason, lodge, lists, ford, as, a, member, the, grand, lodge, of, new, york, confirms, that, ford, was, a, freemason, and, was, raised, in, palestine, lodge, no, 357, detroit, in, 1894, when, he, received, the, 33rd, degree, of, the, scottish, rite, in, 1940, he, said, masonry, is, the, best, balance, wheel, the, united, states, has, in, 1923, ford, s, pastor, and, head, of, his, sociology, department, episcopal, minister, samuel, s, marquis, claimed, that, ford, believed, or, once, believed, in, reincarnation, ford, published, an, anti, smoking, book, circulated, to, youth, in, 1914, called, the, case, against, the, little, white, slaver, which, documented, many, dangers, of, cigarette, smoking, attested, to, by, many, researchers, and, luminaries, at, the, time, smoking, was, ubiquitous, and, not, yet, widely, associated, with, health, problems, making, ford, s, opposition, to, cigarettes, unusual, henry, ford, had, a, long, held, interest, in, materials, science, and, engineering, he, enthusiastically, described, his, company, s, adoption, of, vanadium, steel, alloys, and, subsequent, metallurgic, r, d, work, ford, also, had, a, long, standing, interest, in, plastics, developed, from, agricultural, products, particularly, soybeans, he, cultivated, a, relationship, with, george, washington, carver, for, this, purpose, soybean, based, plastics, were, used, in, ford, automobiles, throughout, the, 1930s, in, plastic, parts, such, as, car, horns, in, paint, and, other, components, the, project, culminated, in, 1942, when, ford, patented, an, automobile, made, almost, entirely, of, plastic, attached, to, a, tubular, welded, frame, it, weighed, 30, less, than, a, steel, car, and, was, said, to, be, able, to, withstand, blows, ten, times, greater, than, steel, it, ran, on, grain, alcohol, ethanol, instead, of, gasoline, the, design, never, caught, on, ford, was, interested, in, engineered, woods, better, wood, can, be, made, than, is, grown, at, this, time, plywood, and, particle, board, were, little, more, than, experimental, ideas, corn, as, a, fuel, source, via, both, corn, oil, and, ethanol, and, the, potential, uses, of, cotton, ford, was, instrumental, in, developing, charcoal, briquets, under, the, brand, name, kingsford, his, brother, in, law, edward, g, kingsford, used, wood, scraps, from, the, ford, factory, to, make, the, briquets, in, 1927, ford, partnered, with, thomas, edison, and, harvey, samuel, firestone, each, contributing, 25, 000, to,

vacation, residence, in, fort, myers, florida, next, to, that, of, thomas, edison, which, he, bought, in, 1915, and, used, until, c, 1930, it, still, stands, today, as, a, museum, he, also, had, a, vacation, home, known, today, as, the, ford, plantation, in, richmond, hill, georgia, which, is, now, a, private, community, ford, started, buying, land, in, this, area, and, eventually, owned, 70, 000, acres, 110, square, miles, there, in, 1936, ford, broke, ground, for, a, beautiful, greek, revival, style, mansion, on, the, banks, of, the, ogeechee, river, on, the, site, of, a, 1730s, plantation, the, grand, house, made, of, savannah, gray, brick, had, marble, steps, air, conditioning, and, an, elevator, it, sat, on, 55, acres, 22, ha, of, manicured, lawns, and, flowering, gardens,

the, creation, of, greenfield, village, in, dearborn, michigan, it, may, have, inspired, the, creation, of, old, sturbridge, village, as, well, about, the, same, time, he, began, collecting, materials, for, his, museum, which, had, a, theme, of, practical, technology, it, was, opened, in, 1929, as, the, edison, institute, the, museum, has, been, greatly, modernized, and, is, still, open,
