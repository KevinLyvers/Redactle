the, original, references, used, in, chinese, ink, painting, this, influenced, his, following, work, greatly, since, before, visiting, china, sessh, worked, under, sh, bun, s, style, following, sessh, s, three, years, in, china, his, familiarity, with, chinese, landscapes, showed, in, succeeding, works, as, they, held, a, distinct, chinese, influence, with, his, developing, individualistic, style,

them, to, focus, on, the, essential, character, of, the, subject, since, zen, buddhism, stresses, material, simplicity, and, sensitivity, to, the, natural, world, to, create, his, monochrome, paintings, in, diluted, greys, and, black, ink, sessh, used, black, sumi, meaning, charcoal, or, soot, based, solid, ink, on, paper, or, silk, thus, following, the, art, of, sumi, e, some, of, sessh, s, most, acclaimed, works, include, winter, landscape, c, 1470s, four, landscape, scrolls, of, the, seasons, c, 1420, 1506, and, birds, and, flowers, c, 1420, 1506, demonstrating, his, style, of, flattened, space, emphatic, outlines, and, angular, brushstrokes, to, portray, zen, beliefs, following, his, sojourn, in, china, sessh, painted, winter, landscape, c, 1470s, in, japan, s, rural, provinces, demonstrating, how, sessh, combined, his, artistic, techniques, and, zen, concepts, sessh, solely, used, black, sumi, ink, diluted, to, shades, of, grey, flat, overlapping, mountains, depict, the, snowy, landscape, through, short, expressive, brushstrokes, sessh, depicts, a, male, figure, trekking, up, a, steeped, pathway, to, a, barren, temple, complex, suggesting, the, arduousness, of, his, journey, during, the, peak, of, winter, common, to, sessh, s, paintings, the, single, figure, is, surrounded, by, a, towering, landscape, that, draws, on, the, concept, of, mono, no, aware, humankind, being, present, with, nature, to, create, a, secluding, atmosphere, throughout, the, composition, sessh, uses, the, shumpo, technique, varying, the, firmness, and, thickness, of, outlines, to, depict, three, dimensionality, and, textures, this, modelling, is, enhanced, by, the, diluted, ink, washes, and, rendering, using, fine, lines, in, the, foreground, the, rocks, and, trees, show, weighted, dark, lines, whilst, the, left, distant, mountains, are, outlined, against, the, grey, sky, with, a, single, brushstroke, to, capture, the, moment, the, intensity, of, sessh, s, work, is, shown, by, the, sharp, angular, brushstrokes, in, the, centre, reflecting, zen, buddhism, s, influence, similarly, he, uses, ink, wash, for, the, rolling, mist, to, divide, the, space, between, solid, and, void, mirroring, the, taoist, metaphysical, concept, of, tension, between, subjects, this, is, heightened, by, the, sharp, diagonals, of, the, opposing, foreground, rocks, as, they, bring, a, sense, of, inescapable, pent, up, energy, the, background, features, a, single, strong, lightning, like, brushstroke, that, outlines, the, central, cliffs, as, the, tip, vanishes, into, the, mist, suggesting, transitory, moments, in, time, as, believed, in, zen, buddhism, overall, winter, landscape, represents, sessh, s, stylistic, choices, and, implementation, of, zen, buddhist, concepts, notably, drawing, on, chinese, landscapes, that, symbolised, a, virtuous, man, s, dedication, to, remaining, honourable, during, strenuous, moments, painted, at, 67, years, old, sessh, t, y, s, four, landscape, scrolls, of, the, seasons, c, 1420, 1506, depicts, the, flow, of, the, four, seasons, whilst, reflecting, on, his, experiences, with, japanese, and, chinese, landscapes, each, scroll, is, composed, of, two, silk, strips, as, the, paintings, were, originally, screen, panels, but, were, later, arranged, on, a, single, kakemono, despite, depicting, the, seasons, sequentially, as, spring, summer, autumn, winter, the, autumn, scroll, is, distinctively, different, from, sessh, s, travels, autumn, holds, a, dominating, chinese, stylistic, influence, for, example, sessh, s, use, of, the, chinese, technique, progressive, vision, where, using, several, viewpoints, creates, an, image, more, accurate, to, one, s, experience, with, nature, suggesting, a, synthesis, of, time, and, space, sessh, s, treatment, of, pine, needles, aligns, with, the, method, of, sung, yeh, tien, whilst, the, dotted, leaves, mirror, ku, chiao, tien, black, pepper, dots, which, were, techniques, shared, by, chinese, artists, before, sessh, within, this, painting, sessh, reduces, proportions, as, the, space, recedes, whilst, placing, distant, objects, higher, in, the, composition, this, is, heightened, through, atmospheric, perspective, where, sessh, ambiguously, manipulates, the, line, quality, and, texture, for, recession, overall, four, landscape, scrolls, of, the, seasons, demonstrates, chinese, influences, on, sessh, s, work, and, his, use, of, space, and, composition, to, represent, the, soul, of, nature, in, the, landscapes, the, influences, of, sessh, s, studies, in, china, are, reflected, in, two, famous, hanging, scrolls, of, seasonal, landscape, paintings, of, birds, and, flowers, painted, in, ink, and, colour, on, silk, in, the, perry, collection, sessh, paints, assertive, rock, contours, and, textures, using, a, wet, brush, with, splitting, hairs, this, brings, a, scratchy, rough, texture, to, give, the, rocks, a, sense, of, solidity, and, tangibility, such, technique, can, be, seen, in, the, four, landscape, scrolls, of, the, seasons, autumn, and, winter, landscapes, as, a, recurring, motif, in, sessh, s, landscapes, the, rock, is, trapezoidal, with, two, indentations, on, top, like, in, winter, landscape, sessh, uses, a, zigzag, or, lighting, shape, to, contribute, to, the, composition, s, structure, within, this, composition, sessh, flattens, space, using, spatial, ambiguities, and, variations, in, scale, sessh, s, contrast, in, scale, creates, an, illusion, similar, to, the, zen, notion, of, zero, time, and, space, where, there, are, no, distinctions, between, past, present, or, future, compositionally, there, is, no, distinction, between, the, whole, image, and, the, subjects, that, make, it, sessh, purposefully, controls, tonal, intensities, to, suggest, atmospheric, perspective, through, subtle, ink, gradations, for, the, mist, to, evoke, poetic, autumnal, feelings, sessh, s, emphasis, on, zen, buddhism, personal, interpretation, and, economical, expression, in, painting, was, the, basis, of, his, legacy, for, succeeding, japanese, artists, subsequently, his, rendering, techniques, were, widely, used, by, sixteenth, century, artists, notably, those, who, attended, sessh, s, painting, schools
