assured, that, this, didn, t, prevent, architecture, from, going, in, a, different, direction, niemeyer, was, most, famous, for, his, use, of, abstract, forms, and, curves, and, wrote, in, his,

most, prolific, architects, working, both, domestically, and, overseas, this, included, the, design, of, the, edif, cio, copan, a, large, residential, building, in, s, o, paulo, and, a, collaboration, with, le, corbusier, and, others, on, the, united, nations, headquarters, which, yielded, invitations, to, teach, at, yale, university, and, the, harvard, graduate, school, of, design, in, 1956,

common, design, elements, this, work, led, to, his, appointment, as, inaugural, head, of, architecture, at, the, university, of, bras, lia, as, well, as, honorary, membership, of, the, american, institute, of, architects, due, to, his, largely, left, wing, ideology, and, involvement, with, the, brazilian, communist, party, pcb, niemeyer, left, the, country, after, the, 1964, military, coup,

to, have, been, oscar, ribeiro, de, almeida, de, niemeyer, soares, or, simply, oscar, de, almeida, soares, but, the, foreign, surname, prevailed, and, i, am, known, simply, as, oscar, niemeyer, he, spent, his, youth, as, a, typical, young, carioca, of, the, time, bohemian, and, relatively, unconcerned, with, his, future, in, 1928, at, age, 21, niemeyer, left, school, santo, antonio, maria, zaccaria, priory, school, and, married, annita, baldo, daughter, of, italian, immigrants, from, padua, he, pursued, his, passion, at, the, national, school, of, fine, arts, in, rio, de, janeiro,

financially, stable, he, insisted, on, working, in, the, architecture, studio, of, l, cio, costa, gregori, warchavchik, and, carlos, le, o, even, though, they, could, not, pay, him, niemeyer, joined, them, as, a, draftsman, an, art, that, he, mastered, corbusier, himself, would, later, compliment, niemeyer, s, beautiful, perspectives, the, contact, with, costa, would, be, extremely, important, to, niemeyer, s, maturation, costa, after, an, initial, flirtation, with, the, neocolonial, movement, realized, that, the, advances, of, the, international, style, in, europe, were, the, way, forward, for, architecture, his, writings, on, the, insights, that, could, unite, brazil, s, traditional, colonial, architecture, such, as, that, in, olinda, with, modernist, principles, would, be, the, basis, of, the, architecture, that, he, and, his, contemporaries, such, as, affonso, eduardo, reidy, would, later, realize, in, 1936, at, 29, l, cio, costa, was, appointed, by, education, minister, gustavo, capanema, to, design, the, new, headquarters, of, the, ministry, of, education, and, health, in, rio, de, janeiro, costa, himself, although, open, to, change, was, unsure, of, how, to, proceed, he, assembled, a, group, of, young, architects, carlos, le, o, affonso, eduardo, reidy, jorge, moreira, and, ernani, vasconcellos, to, design, the, building, he, also, insisted, that, le, corbusier, himself, should, be, invited, as, a, consultant, though, niemeyer, was, not, initially, part, of, the, team, costa, agreed, to, accept, him, after, niemeyer, insisted, during, the, period, of, le, corbusier, s, stay, in, rio, he, was, appointed, to, help, the, master, with, his, drafts, which, allowed, him, a, close, contact, with, the, swiss, after, his, departure, niemeyer, s, significant, changes, to, corbusier, s, scheme, impressed, costa, who, allowed, him, to, progressively, take, charge, of, the, project, of, which, he, assumed, leadership, in, 1939, the, ministry, of, education, had, assumed, the, task, of, shaping, the, novo, homem, brasileiro, e, moderno, new, man, brazilian, and, modern, it, was, the, first, state, sponsored, modernist, skyscraper, in, the, world, of, a, much, larger, scale, than, anything, le, corbusier, had, built, until, then, completed, in, 1943, when, he, was, 36, years, old, the, building, that, housed, the, regulator, and, manager, of, brazilian, culture, and, cultural, heritage, developed, the, elements, of, what, was, to, become, recognized, as, brazilian, modernism, it, employed, local, materials, and, techniques, like, the, azulejos, linked, to, the, portuguese, tradition, the, revolutionized, corbusian, brises, soleil, made, adjustable, and, related, to, the, moorish, shading, devices, of, colonial, architecture, bold, colors, the, tropical, gardens, of, roberto, burle, marx, the, imperial, palm, roystonea, oleracea, known, as, the, brazilian, order, further, allusions, to, the, icons, of, the, brazilian, landscape, and, specially, commissioned, works, by, brazilian, artists, this, building, is, considered, by, some, architects, as, one, of, the, most, influential, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, taken, as, a, model, on, how, to, blend, low, and, high, rise, structures, lever, house, in, 1939, at, age, 32, niemeyer, and, costa, designed, the, brazilian, pavilion, for, the, new, york, world, s, fair, executed, in, collaboration, with, paul, lester, wiener, neighbouring, the, much, larger, french, pavilion, the, brazilian, structure, contrasted, with, its, heavy, mass, costa, explained, that, the, brazilian, pavilion, adopted, a, language, of, grace, and, elegance, lightness, and, spatial, fluidity, with, an, open, plan, curves, and, free, walls, which, he, termed, ionic, contrasting, it, to, the, mainstream, contemporary, modernist, architecture, which, he, termed, doric, impressed, by, its, avant, garde, design, mayor, fiorello, la, guardia, awarded, niemeyer, the, keys, to, the, city, of, new, york, in, 1937, niemeyer, was, invited, by, a, relative, to, design, a, nursery, for, philanthropic, institution, which, catered, for, young, mothers, the, obra, do, ber, o, it, would, become, his, first, finalised, work, however, niemeyer, has, said, that, his, architecture, really, began, in, pampulha, minas, gerais, and, as, he, explained, in, an, interview, pampulha, was, the, starting, point, of, this, freer, architecture, full, of, curves, which, i, still, love, even, today, it, was, in, fact, the, beginning, of, bras, lia, in, 1940, at, 33, niemeyer, met, juscelino, kubitschek, who, was, at, the, time, the, mayor, of, belo, horizonte, capital, of, the, state, of, minas, gerais, kubitschek, together, with, the, state, s, governor, benedito, valadares, wanted, to, develop, a, new, suburb, to, the, north, of, the, city, called, pampulha, and, commissioned, niemeyer, to, design, a, series, of, buildings, which, would, become, known, as, the, pampulha, architectural, complex, the, complex, included, a, casino, a, restaurant, dance, hall, a, yacht, club, a, golf, club, and, a, church, all, of, which, would, be, distributed, around, a, new, artificial, lake, a, weekend, retreat, for, the, mayor, was, built, near, the, lake, the, buildings, were, completed, in, 1943, and, received, international, acclaim, following, the, 1943, brazil, builds, exhibition, at, the, new, york, museum, of, modern, art, moma, most, of, the, buildings, show, niemeyer, s, particular, approach, to, the, corbusian, language, in, the, casino, with, its, relatively, rigid, main, fa, ade, niemeyer, departed, from, corbusian, principles, and, designed, curved, volumes, outside, the, confinement, of, a, rational, grid, he, also, expanded, upon, corbusier, s, idea, of, a, promenade, architecturale, with, his, designs, for, floating, catwalk, like, ramps, which, unfold, open, vistas, to, the, occupants, the, small, restaurant, casa, do, baile, which, is, perhaps, the, least, bourgeois, of, the, complex, is, built, on, its, own, artificial, island, and, comprises, an, approximately, circular, block, from, which, a, free, form, marquee, follows, the, contour, of, the, island, although, free, form, had, been, used, even, in, corbusier, s, and, mies, s, architecture, its, application, on, an, outdoors, marquee, was, niemeyer, s, innovation, this, application, of, free, form, together, with, the, butterfly, roof, used, at, the, yacht, club, and, kubitschek, s, house, became, extremely, fashionable, from, then, on, the, saint, francis, of, assisi, church, is, considered, the, masterpiece, of, the, complex, when, it, was, built, reinforced, concrete, was, used, in, traditional, ways, such, as, in, pillar, beam, and, slab, structures, auguste, perret, in, casablanca, and, robert, maillart, in, zurich, had, experimented, with, the, plastic, freedom, of, concrete, taking, advantage, of, the, parabolic, arch, s, geometry, to, build, extremely, thin, shells, niemeyer, s, decision, to, use, such, an, economical, approach, based, on, the, inherent, plasticity, allowed, by, reinforced, concrete, was, revolutionary, according, to, joaquim, cardoso, the, unification, of, wall, and, roof, into, a, single, element, was, revolutionary, for, fusing, vertical, and, horizontal, elements, the, church, s, exuberance, added, to, the, integration, between, architecture, and, art, the, church, is, covered, by, azulejos, by, portinari, and, tile, murals, by, paulo, werneck, it, led, to, the, church, being, seen, as, baroque, though, some, european, purists, condemned, its, formalism, the, fact, that, the, form, s, idea, was, directly, linked, to, a, logical, structural, reason, placed, the, building, in, the, 20th, century, while, refusing, to, break, completely, from, the, past, due, to, its, importance, in, the, history, of, architecture, the, church, was, the, first, listed, modern, building, in, brazil, this, fact, did, not, influence, the, conservative, church, authorities, of, minas, gerais, who, refused, to, consecrate, it, until, 1959, in, part, because, of, its, unorthodox, form, and, in, part, because, of, portinari, s, altar, mural, which, depicts, saint, francis, as, the, savior, of, the, ill, the, poor, and, most, importantly, the, sinner, niemeyer, stated, that, pampulha, offered, him, the, opportunity, to, challenge, the, monotony, of, contemporary, architecture, the, wave, of, misinterpreted, functionalism, that, hindered, it, and, the, dogmas, of, form, and, function, that, had, emerged, counteracting, the, plastic, freedom, that, reinforced, concrete, introduced, i, was, attracted, by, the, curve, the, liberated, sensual, curve, suggested, by, the, possibilities, of, new, technology, yet, so, often, recalled, in, venerable, old, baroque, churches, i, deliberately, disregarded, the, right, angle, and, rationalist, architecture, designed, with, ruler, and, square, to, boldly, enter, the, world, of, curves, and, straight, lines, offered, by, reinforced, concrete, this, deliberate, protest, arose, from, the, environment, in, which, i, lived, with, its, white, beaches, its, huge, mountains, its, old, baroque, churches, and, the, beautiful, suntanned, women, the, experience, also, marked, the, first, collaborations, between, niemeyer, and, roberto, burle, marx, considered, the, most, important, modern, landscape, architect, they, would, be, partners, in, many, projects, in, the, next, 10, years, with, the, success, of, pampulha, and, the, brazil, builds, exhibition, niemeyer, achieved, international, recognition, his, architecture, further, developed, the, brazilian, style, that, the, saint, francis, of, assisi, church, and, to, a, lesser, extent, due, to, its, primary, corbusian, language, the, ministry, building, had, pioneered, works, of, this, period, shows, the, traditional, modernist, method, in, which, form, follows, function, but, niemeyer, s, and, other, brazilian, architects, handling, of, scale, proportion, and, program, allowed, him, to, resolve, complex, problems, with, simple, and, intelligent, plans, stamo, papadaki, in, his, monography, on, niemeyer, mentioned, the, spatial, freedom, that, characterized, his, work, the, headquarters, of, the, banco, boavista, inaugurated, in, 1948, show, such, an, approach, dealing, with, a, typical, urban, site, niemeyer, adopted, creative, solutions, to, enliven, the, otherwise, monolithic, high, rise, thus, challenging, the, predominant, solidity, which, was, the, norm, for, bank, buildings, the, glazed, south, fa, ade, with, least, insulation, reflects, the, 19th, century, candel, ria, church, showing, niemeyer, s, sensitivity, to, the, surroundings, and, older, architecture, such, austere, designs, to, high, rises, within, urban, grids, can, also, be, seen, in, the, edif, cio, montreal, 1951, 1954, edif, cio, tri, ngulo, 1955, and, the, edif, cio, sede, do, banco, mineiro, da, produ, o, in, 1947, niemeyer, returned, to, new, york, city, to, integrate, the, international, team, working, on, the, design, for, the, united, nations, headquarters, niemeyer, s, scheme, 32, was, approved, by, the, board, of, design, but, he, eventually, gave, in, to, pressure, by, le, corbusier, and, together, they, submitted, project, 23, 32, developed, with, bodiansky, and, weissmann, which, combined, elements, from, niemeyer, s, and, le, corbusier, s, schemes, despite, le, corbusier, s, insistence, to, remain, involved, the, design, was, carried, forward, by, the, director, of, planning, wallace, harrison, and, max, abramovitz, then, a, partnership, this, stay, in, the, united, states, also, facilitated, contact, regarding, the, unbuilt, burton, g, tremaine, house, project, one, of, niemeyer, s, boldest, residential, designs, amidst, gardens, by, roberto, burle, marx, it, featured, an, open, plan, in, montecito, california, on, the, pacific, ocean, in, february, april, 1949, the, museum, of, modern, art, exhibited, from, le, corbusier, to, niemeyer, savoye, house, tremaine, house, 1949, according, to, the, museum, the, theme, of, this, show, is, based, on, henry, russell, hitchcock, s, book, on, the, miller, company, collection, of, abstract, art, painting, toward, architecture, in, 2010, berry, bergdoll, a, curator, at, moma, asserted, the, importance, of, the, exhibition, as, fusing, strands, of, the, geometric, and, organic, soon, after, wwii, hitchcock, s, seminal, essay, in, the, painting, toward, architecture, book, included, an, illustration, of, niemeyer, s, design, and, in, an, associated, 28, venue, exhibition, burle, marx, s, design, for, a, garden, 1948, was, exhibited, in, several, shows, as, was, a, photo, mural, of, church, at, pampulha, niemeyer, produced, very, few, designs, for, the, united, states, because, his, affiliation, to, the, communist, party, usually, prevented, him, from, obtaining, a, visa, this, happened, in, 1946, when, he, was, invited, to, teach, at, yale, university, when, his, political, views, cost, him, a, visa, in, 1953, at, 46, niemeyer, was, appointed, dean, of, the, harvard, graduate, school, of, design, but, because, of, his, political, views, the, united, states, government, denied, his, visa, therefore, preventing, him, from, entering, the, country, in, 1950, the, first, book, about, his, work, to, be, published, in, the, united, states, the, work, of, oscar, niemeyer, by, stamo, papadaki, was, released, it, was, the, first, systematic, study, of, his, architecture, which, significantly, contributed, to, the, awareness, of, his, work, abroad, it, would, be, followed, in, 1956, by, oscar, niemeyer, works, in, progress, by, the, same, author, by, this, time, niemeyer, was, already, self, confident, and, following, his, own, path, internationally, in, 1948, niemeyer, departed, from, the, parabolic, arches, he, had, designed, in, pampulha, to, further, explore, his, signature, material, concrete, niemeyer, s, formal, creativity, has, been, compared, to, that, of, sculptors, in, the, 1950s, a, time, of, intensive, construction, in, brazil, produced, numerous, commissions, yves, bruand, stressed, that, niemeyer, s, 1948, project, for, a, theatre, next, to, the, ministry, of, education, and, health, allowed, him, to, develop, his, vocabulary, in, 1950, he, was, asked, to, design, s, o, paulo, s, ibirapuera, park, for, the, city, s, 400th, anniversary, celebration, the, plan, which, consisted, of, several, porticoed, pavilions, related, via, a, gigantic, free, form, marquee, had, to, be, simplified, due, to, cost, the, resulting, buildings, were, less, interesting, individually, which, meant, that, the, ensemble, effect, became, the, dominant, aesthetic, experience, niemeyer, developed, v, shaped, pilotis, for, the, project, which, became, fashionable, for, a, time, a, variation, on, that, theme, was, the, w, shaped, piloti, which, supports, the, governador, juscelino, kubitschek, housing, complex, 1951, two, large, buildings, containing, around, 1, 000, apartments, its, design, was, based, on, niemeyer, s, scheme, for, the, quitandinha, apartment, hotel, in, petr, polis, designed, one, year, earlier, but, never, realised, at, 33, stories, and, over, 400, meters, long, it, was, to, contain, 5, 700, living, units, together, with, communal, services, such, as, shops, schools, etc, his, version, of, corbusier, s, unit, d, habitation, a, similar, program, was, realized, in, the, centre, of, s, o, paulo, the, copan, apartment, building, 1953, 66, this, landmark, represents, a, microcosm, of, the, diverse, population, of, the, city, its, horizontality, which, is, emphasized, by, the, concrete, brise, soleil, together, with, the, fact, that, it, was, a, residential, building, made, it, an, interesting, approach, to, popular, housing, given, that, in, the, 1950s, suburbanization, had, begun, and, city, centres, were, being, occupied, primarily, by, business, usually, occupying, vertical, masculine, buildings, as, opposed, to, niemeyer, s, feminine, approach, in, 1954, niemeyer, also, designed, the, niemeyer, apartment, building, at, the, pra, a, da, liberdade, belo, horizonte, the, building, s, completely, free, form, layout, is, reminiscent, of, mies, van, der, rohe, s, 1922, glass, skyscraper, although, with, a, much, more, material, feel, than, the, airy, german, one, also, in, 1954, as, part, of, the, same, plaza, niemeyer, built, a, library, the, biblioteca, p, blica, estadual, during, this, period, niemeyer, built, several, residences, among, them, were, a, weekend, house, for, his, father, in, mendes, 1949, developed, from, a, chicken, coop, the, prudente, de, morais, neto, house, in, rio, 1943, 49, based, on, niemeyer, s, original, design, for, kubitschek, s, house, in, pampulha, a, house, for, gustavo, capanema, 1947, the, minister, who, commissioned, the, ministry, of, education, and, health, building, the, leonel, miranda, house, 1952, featuring, two, spiral, ramps, which, provide, access, to, the, butterfly, roofed, first, floor, lifted, up, on, oblique, piloti, these, houses, featured, the, same, inclined, fa, ade, used, in, the, tremaine, design, which, allowed, good, natural, lighting, in, 1954, he, built, the, famous, cavanelas, house, with, its, tent, like, metallic, roof, and, which, with, the, help, of, burle, marx, s, gardens, is, perfectly, adapted, to, its, mountainous, site, however, his, residential, and, free, form, architecture, masterpiece, is, considered, to, be, the, 1953, canoas, house, niemeyer, built, for, himself, the, house, is, located, on, sloped, terrain, overlooking, the, ocean, from, afar, it, comprises, two, floors, the, first, of, which, is, under, a, free, form, roof, supported, on, thin, metallic, columns, the, living, quarters, is, located, on, the, floor, below, and, is, more, traditionally, divided, the, design, takes, advantage, of, the, uneven, terrain, so, that, the, house, seems, not, to, disturb, the, landscape, although, the, house, is, extremely, well, suited, to, its, environment, it, did, not, escape, criticism, niemeyer, recalled, that, walter, gropius, who, was, visiting, the, country, as, a, jury, in, the, second, biennial, exhibition, in, s, o, paulo, argued, that, the, house, could, not, be, mass, produced, to, which, niemeyer, responded, that, the, house, was, designed, with, himself, in, mind, and, for, that, particular, site, not, a, general, flat, one, for, henry, russell, hitchcock, the, house, at, canoas, was, niemeyer, s, most, extreme, lyrical, statement, placing, rhythm, and, dance, as, the, antithesis, of, utility, in, 1953, modern, brazilian, architecture, which, had, been, praised, since, brazil, builds, became, the, target, of, international, criticism, mainly, from, rationalists, niemeyer, s, architecture, in, particular, was, criticised, by, max, bill, in, an, interview, for, manchete, magazine, he, attacked, niemeyer, s, use, of, free, form, as, purely, decorative, as, opposed, to, reidy, s, pedregulho, housing, his, use, of, mural, panels, and, the, individualistic, character, of, his, architecture, which, is, in, risk, of, falling, in, a, dangerous, anti, social, academicism, he, even, belittled, niemeyer, s, v, piloti, as, purely, aesthetic, niemeyer, s, first, response, was, denial, followed, by, a, counterattack, based, on, bill, s, patronizing, attitude, which, prevented, him, from, considering, the, differing, social, and, economic, realities, of, brazil, and, european, countries, costa, also, stressed, that, brazilian, and, niemeyer, s, architecture, was, based, on, unskilled, work, which, allowed, for, a, crafted, architecture, based, on, concrete, expressing, a, tradition, of, brazilian, church, builders, as, opposed, to, swiss, clock, builders, although, it, was, badly, received, and, to, an, extent, an, exaggeration, bill, s, words, were, effective, in, bringing, to, attention, the, mediocre, architecture, coming, from, less, talented, architects, who, employed, niemeyer, s, vocabulary, in, the, decorative, fashion, that, bill, had, criticised, niemeyer, himself, admitted, that, for, a, certain, period, he, had, handled, too, many, commissions, executing, them, in, a, hurry, trusting, the, improvisational, skills, he, believed, to, have, the, calif, rnia, building, edif, cio, calif, rnia, in, s, o, paulo, is, an, example, usually, neglected, by, its, creator, it, features, the, v, piloti, which, had, worked, so, well, in, isolated, buildings, creating, a, different, treatment, to, that, space, without, the, need, for, two, separate, structural, systems, as, corbusier, had, done, in, marseille, its, use, in, a, typical, urban, context, was, formalistic, and, even, compromised, the, building, s, structural, logic, in, that, it, required, many, different, sized, supports, berlin, s, 1957, interbau, exhibition, gave, niemeyer, the, chance, to, build, an, example, of, his, architecture, in, germany, along, with, the, chance, to, visit, europe, for, the, first, time, the, contact, with, the, monuments, of, the, old, world, had, a, lasting, impact, on, niemeyer, s, views, which, he, now, believed, was, completely, dependent, on, its, aesthetic, qualities, together, with, his, own, realisations, of, how, brazilian, architecture, had, been, harmed, by, untalented, architects, this, trip, led, niemeyer, to, revise, his, approach, which, he, published, as, a, text, named, depoimento, in, his, m, dulo, magazine, he, proposed, a, simplification, discarding, multiple, elements, such, as, brises, sculptural, piloti, and, marquees, his, architecture, from, then, on, would, be, a, pure, expression, of, structure, as, a, representation, of, solid, volumes, his, design, method, would, also, change, prioritizing, aesthetic, impact, over, programmatic, functions, given, that, for, him, when, form, creates, beauty, it, has, in, beauty, itself, its, justification, in, 1955, at, 48, niemeyer, designed, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, caracas, the, design, of, this, museum, was, the, material, realization, of, his, work, revision, meant, to, rise, from, the, top, of, a, cliff, overlooking, central, caracas, the, museum, had, an, inverted, pyramid, shape, which, dominated, and, overpowered, its, surroundings, the, opaque, prismatic, building, had, almost, no, connection, to, the, outside, through, its, walls, although, its, glass, ceiling, allowed, natural, light, to, enter, an, electronic, system, was, used, to, keep, lighting, conditions, unchanged, throughout, the, day, using, artificial, light, to, complement, it, the, interior, however, was, more, recognizably, done, in, niemeyer, s, mode, with, cat, walk, ramps, linking, the, different, levels, and, the, mezzanine, made, as, a, free, form, slab, hung, from, ceiling, beams, this, aesthetic, simplicity, would, culminate, in, his, work, in, bras, lia, where, the, qualities, of, the, buildings, are, expressed, by, their, structural, elements, alone, juscelino, kubitschek, visited, niemeyer, at, the, canoas, house, in, september, 1956, soon, after, he, assumed, the, brazilian, presidency, while, driving, back, to, the, city, the, politician, spoke, to, the, architect, about, his, most, audacious, scheme, i, am, going, to, build, a, new, capital, for, this, country, and, i, want, you, to, help, me, oscar, this, time, we, are, going, to, build, the, capital, of, brazil, niemeyer, organized, a, competition, for, the, lay, out, of, bras, lia, the, new, capital, and, the, winner, was, the, project, of, his, old, master, and, great, friend, l, cio, costa, niemeyer, would, design, the, buildings, l, cio, the, layout, of, the, city, in, the, space, of, a, few, months, niemeyer, designed,

the, cathedral, of, bras, lia, a, hyperboloid, structure, diverse, ministries, viewed, from, above, the, city, can, be, seen, to, have, elements, that, repeat, themselves, in, every, building, achieving, a, formal, unity, behind, the, construction, of, bras, lia, lay, a, monumental, campaign, to, construct, an, entire, city, in, the, barren, center, of, the, country, hundreds, of, kilometers, from, any, major, city, the, brainchild, of, kubitschek, niemeyer, had, as, aims, included, stimulating, industry, integrating, the, country, s, distant, areas, populating, inhospitable, regions, and, bringing, progress, to, a, region, where, only, cattle, ranching, then, existed, niemeyer, and, costa, used, it, to, test, new, concepts, of, city, planning, streets, without, transit, buildings, floating, off, the, ground, supported, by, columns, and, allowing, the, space, underneath, to, be, free, and, integrated, with, nature, the, project, adopted, a, socialist, ideology, in, bras, lia, all, the, apartments, would, be, owned, by, the, government, and, rented, to, employees, bras, lia, did, not, have, nobler, regions, meaning, that, top, ministers, and, common, laborers, would, share, the, same, building, many, of, these, concepts, were, ignored, or, changed, by, other, presidents, with, different, visions, in, later, years, bras, lia, was, designed, constructed, and,
