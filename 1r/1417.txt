poles, were, more, scattered, living, in, outlying, areas, and, shading, off, into, the, peasantry, consequently, when, a, gang, of, jewish, boys, met, a, polish, gang, the, latter, would, almost, inevitably, represent, a, single, suburb, and, thus, be, poorer, in, fighting, potential, than, the, jews, who, even, if, their, numbers, were, initially, fewer, could, quickly, call, on,

on, self, defense, in, 1937, the, peel, commission, recommended, partitioning, palestine, into, jewish, and, arab, areas, and, ben, gurion, supported, this, policy, this, led, to, conflict, with, ze, ev, jabotinsky, who, opposed, partition, and, as, a, result, jabotinsky, s, supporters, split, with, the, haganah, and, abandoned, havlagah, the, house, where, he, lived, from, 1931, on, and, for, part, of, each, year, after, 1953, is, now, a, historic, house, museum, in, tel, aviv, the, ben, gurion, house, he, also, lived, in, london, for, some, months, in, 1941, in, 1946, ben, gurion, and, north, vietnam, s, politburo, chairman, ho, chi, minh, became, very, friendly, when, they, stayed, at, the, same, hotel, in, paris, ho, chi, minh, offered, ben, gurion, a, jewish, home, in, exile, in, vietnam, ben, gurion, declined, telling, ho, chi, minh, i, am, certain, we, shall, be, able, to, establish, a, jewish, government, in, palestine, according, to, his, biographer, tom, segev, ben, gurion, deeply, admired, lenin, and, intended, to, be, a, zionist, lenin, in, ben, gurion, a, political, life, by, shimon, peres, and, david, landau, peres, recalls, his, first, meeting, with, ben, gurion, as, a, young, activist, in, the, no, ar, ha, oved, youth, movement, ben, gurion, gave, him, a, lift, and, out, of, the, blue, told, him, why, he, preferred, lenin, to, trotsky, lenin, was, trotsky, s, inferior, in, terms, of, intellect, but, lenin, unlike, trotsky, was, decisive, when, confronted, with, a, dilemma, trotsky, would, do, what, ben, gurion, despised, about, the, old, style, diaspora, jews, he, manoeuvred, as, opposed, to, lenin, who, would, cut, the, gordian, knot, accepting, losses, while, focusing, on, the, essentials, in, peres, opinion, the, essence, of, ben, gurion, s, life, work, were, the, decisions, he, made, at, critical, junctures, in, israel, s, history, and, none, was, as, important, as, the, acceptance, of, the, 1947, partition, plan, a, painful, compromise, which, gave, the, emerging, jewish, state, little, more, than, a, fighting, chance, but, which, according, to, peres, enabled, the, establishment, of, the, state, of, israel, the, 1937, ben, gurion, letter, was, written, when, he, was, head, of, the, executive, committee, of, the, jewish, agency, to, his, son, amos, on, 5, october, 1937, the, letter, is, well, known, to, scholars, as, it, provides, insight, into, ben, gurion, s, reaction, to, the, report, of, the, peel, commission, released, on, 7, july, of, the, same, year, it, has, also, been, subject, to, significant, debate, by, scholars, as, a, result, of, scribbled, out, text, that, may, or, may, not, provide, written, evidence, of, an, intention, to, expel, the, arabs, or, not, expel, the, arabs, depending, on, one, s, interpretation, of, whether, such, deletion, was, intended, by, ben, gurion, israeli, historian, benny, morris, wrote, that, the, idea, of, expulsion, of, palestinian, arabs, was, endorsed, in, practice, by, mainstream, zionist, leaders, particularly, ben, gurion, he, did, not, give, clear, or, written, orders, in, that, regard, but, morris, claims, that, ben, gurion, s, subordinates, understood, his, policy, well, from, april, 1948, ben, gurion, is, projecting, a, message, of, transfer, there, is, no, explicit, order, of, his, in, writing, there, is, no, orderly, comprehensive, policy, but, there, is, an, atmosphere, of, transfer, the, transfer, idea, is, in, the, air, the, entire, leadership, understands, that, this, is, the, idea, the, officer, corps, understands, what, is, required, of, them, under, ben, gurion, a, consensus, of, transfer, is, created, ben, gurion, published, two, volumes, setting, out, his, views, on, relations, between, zionists, and, the, arab, world, we, and, our, neighbors, published, in, 1931, and, my, talks, with, arab, leaders, published, in, 1967, ben, gurion, believed, in, the, equal, rights, of, arabs, who, remained, in, and, would, become, citizens, of, israel, he, was, quoted, as, saying, we, must, start, working, in, jaffa, jaffa, must, employ, arab, workers, and, there, is, a, question, of, their, wages, i, believe, that, they, should, receive, the, same, wage, as, a, jewish, worker, an, arab, has, also, the, right, to, be, elected, president, of, the, state, should, he, be, elected, by, all, ben, gurion, recognised, the, strong, attachment, of, palestinian, arabs, to, the, land, in, an, address, to, the, united, nations, on, 2, october, 1947, he, doubted, the, likelihood, of, peace, this, is, our, native, land, it, is, not, as, birds, of, passage, that, we, return, to, it, but, it, is, situated, in, an, area, engulfed, by, arabic, speaking, people, mainly, followers, of, islam, now, if, ever, we, must, do, more, than, make, peace, with, them, we, must, achieve, collaboration, and, alliance, on, equal, terms, remember, what, arab, delegations, from, palestine, and, its, neighbors, say, in, the, general, assembly, and, in, other, places, talk, of, arab, jewish, amity, sound, fantastic, for, the, arabs, do, not, wish, it, they, will, not, sit, at, the, same, table, with, us, they, want, to, treat, us, as, they, do, the, jews, of, bagdad, cairo, and, damascus, nahum, goldmann, criticised, ben, gurion, for, what, he, viewed, as, a, confrontational, approach, to, the, arab, world, goldmann, wrote, ben, gurion, is, the, man, principally, responsible, for, the, anti, arab, policy, because, it, was, he, who, molded, the, thinking, of, generations, of, israelis, simha, flapan, quoted, ben, gurion, as, stating, in, 1938, i, believe, in, our, power, in, our, power, which, will, grow, and, if, it, will, grow, agreement, will, come, goldmann, reported, that, ben, gurion, had, told, him, in, private, in, 1956, why, should, the, arabs, make, peace, if, i, was, an, arab, leader, i, would, never, make, terms, with, israel, that, is, natural, we, have, taken, their, country, sure, god, promised, it, to, us, but, what, does, that, matter, to, them, our, god, is, not, theirs, we, come, from, israel, it, s, true, but, two, thousand, years, ago, and, what, is, that, to, them, there, has, been, anti, semitism, the, nazis, hitler, auschwitz, but, was, that, their, fault, they, only, see, one, thing, we, have, come, here, and, stolen, their, country, why, should, they, accept, that, in, 1909, ben, gurion, attempted, to, learn, arabic, but, gave, up, he, later, became, fluent, in, turkish, the, only, other, languages, he, was, able, to, use, when, in, discussions, with, arab, leaders, were, english, and, to, a, lesser, extent, french, the, british, 1939, white, paper, stipulated, that, jewish, immigration, to, palestine, was, to, be, limited, to, 15, 000, a, year, for, the, first, five, years, and, would, subsequently, be, contingent, on, arab, consent, restrictions, were, also, placed, on, the, rights, of, jews, to, buy, land, from, arabs, after, this, ben, gurion, changed, his, policy, towards, the, british, stating, peace, in, palestine, is, not, the, best, situation, for, thwarting, the, policy, of, the, white, paper, ben, gurion, believed, a, peaceful, solution, with, the, arabs, had, no, chance, and, soon, began, preparing, the, yishuv, for, war, according, to, teveth, through, his, campaign, to, mobilize, the, yishuv, in, support, of, the, british, war, effort, he, strove, to, build, the, nucleus, of, a, hebrew, army, and, his, success, in, this, endeavor, later, brought, victory, to, zionism, in, the, struggle, to, establish, a, jewish, state, during, the, second, world, war, ben, gurion, encouraged, the, jewish, population, to, volunteer, for, the, british, army, he, famously, told, jews, to, support, the, british, as, if, there, is, no, white, paper, and, oppose, the, white, paper, as, if, there, is, no, war, about, 10, of, the, jewish, population, of, palestine, volunteered, for, the, british, armed, forces, including, many, women, at, the, same, time, ben, gurion, assisted, the, illegal, immigration, of, thousands, of, european, jewish, refugees, to, palestine, during, a, period, when, the, british, placed, heavy, restrictions, on, jewish, immigration, in, 1944, the, irgun, and, lehi, two, jewish, right, wing, armed, groups, declared, a, rebellion, against, british, rule, and, began, attacking, british, administrative, and, police, targets, ben, gurion, and, other, mainstream, zionist, leaders, opposed, armed, action, against, the, british, and, after, lehi, assassinated, lord, moyne, the, british, minister, of, state, in, the, middle, east, decided, to, stop, it, by, force, while, lehi, was, convinced, to, suspend, operations, the, irgun, refused, and, as, a, result, the, haganah, began, supplying, intelligence, to, the, british, enabling, them, to, arrest, irgun, members, and, abducting, and, often, torturing, irgun, members, handing, some, over, to, the, british, while, keeping, others, detained, in, secret, haganah, prisons, this, campaign, which, was, called, the, saison, or, hunting, season, left, the, irgun, unable, to, continue, operations, as, they, struggled, to, survive, irgun, leader, menachem, begin, ordered, his, fighters, not, to, retaliate, so, as, to, prevent, a, civil, war, the, saison, became, increasingly, controversial, in, the, yishuv, including, within, the, ranks, of, the, haganah, and, it, was, aborted, at, the, end, of, march, 1945, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, zionist, leadership, in, palestine, had, expected, a, british, decision, to, establish, a, jewish, state, however, it, became, clear, that, the, british, had, no, intention, of, immediately, establishing, a, jewish, state, and, that, limits, on, jewish, immigration, would, remain, for, the, time, being, as, a, result, with, ben, gurion, s, approval, the, haganah, entered, into, a, secret, alliance, with, the, irgun, and, lehi, called, the, jewish, resistance, movement, in, october, 1945, and, participated, in, attacks, against, the, british, in, june, 1946, the, british, launched, operation, agatha, a, large, police, and, military, operation, throughout, palestine, searching, for, arms, and, arresting, jewish, leaders, and, haganah, members, in, order, to, stop, the, attacks, and, find, documentary, evidence, of, the, alliance, the, british, suspected, existed, between, the, haganah, irgun, and, lehi, the, british, had, intended, to, detain, ben, gurion, during, the, operation, but, he, was, visiting, paris, at, the, time, the, british, stored, the, documents, they, had, captured, from, the, jewish, agency, headquarters, in, the, king, david, hotel, which, was, being, used, as, a, military, and, administrative, headquarters, ben, gurion, agreed, to, the, irgun, s, plan, to, bomb, the, king, david, hotel, in, order, to, destroy, incriminating, documents, that, ben, gurion, feared, would, prove, that, the, haganah, had, been, participating, in, the, violent, insurrection, against, the, british, in, cooperation, with, the, irgun, and, lehi, with, the, approval, of, himself, and, other, jewish, agency, officials, however, ben, gurion, asked, that, the, operation, be, delayed, but, the, irgun, refused, the, irgun, carried, out, the, king, david, hotel, bombing, in, july, 1946, killing, 91, people, ben, gurion, publicly, condemned, the, bombing, in, the, aftermath, of, the, bombing, ben, gurion, ordered, that, the, jewish, resistance, movement, be, dissolved, from, then, on, the, irgun, and, lehi, continued, to, regularly, attack, the, british, but, the, haganah, rarely, did, so, and, while, ben, gurion, along, with, other, mainstream, zionist, leaders, publicly, condemned, the, irgun, and, lehi, attacks, in, practice, the, haganah, under, their, direction, rarely, cooperated, with, the, british, in, attempting, to, suppress, the, insurgency, due, to, the, jewish, insurgency, bad, publicity, over, the, restriction, of, jewish, immigrants, to, palestine, non, acceptance, of, a, partitioned, state, as, suggested, by, the, united, nations, amongst, arab, leaders, and, the, cost, of, keeping, 100, 000, troops, in, palestine, the, british, government, referred, the, matter, to, the, united, nations, in, september, 1947, the, british, decided, to, terminate, the, mandate, in, november, 1947, the, united, nations, general, assembly, passed, a, resolution, approving, the, united, nations, partition, plan, for, palestine, while, the, jewish, agency, under, ben, gurion, accepted, the, arabs, rejected, the, plan, and, the, 1947, 1948, civil, war, in, mandatory, palestine, broke, out, ben, gurion, s, strategy, was, for, the, haganah, to, hold, on, to, every, position, with, no, retreat, or, surrender, and, then, launch, an, offensive, when, british, forces, had, evacuated, to, such, an, extent, that, there, would, be, no, more, danger, of, british, intervention, this, strategy, was, successful, and, by, may, 1948, jewish, forces, were, winning, the, civil, war, on, 14, may, 1948, a, few, hours, before, the, british, mandate, officially, terminated, ben, gurion, declared, israeli, independence, in, a, ceremony, in, tel, aviv, a, few, hours, later, the, state, of, israel, officially, came, into, being, when, the, british, mandate, terminated, on, 15, may, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, began, immediately, afterwards, as, numerous, arab, nations, then, invaded, israel, after, the, ten, day, campaign, during, the, 1948, war, the, israelis, were, militarily, superior, to, their, enemies, and, the, cabinet, subsequently, considered, where, and, when, to, attack, next, on, 24, september, an, incursion, made, by, the, palestinian, irregulars, in, the, latrun, sector, killing, 23, israeli, soldiers, precipitated, the, debate, on, 26, september, ben, gurion, put, his, argument, to, the, cabinet, to, attack, latrun, again, and, conquer, the, whole, or, a, large, part, of, west, bank, the, motion, was, rejected, by, a, vote, of, seven, to, five, after, discussions, ben, gurion, qualified, the, cabinet, s, decision, as, bechiya, ledorot, a, source, of, lament, for, generations, considering, israel, may, have, lost, forever, the, old, city, of, jerusalem, there, is, a, controversy, around, these, events, according, to, uri, bar, joseph, ben, gurion, placed, a, plan, that, called, for, a, limited, action, aimed, at, the, conquest, of, latrun, and, not, for, an, all, out, offensive, according, to, david, tal, in, the, cabinet, meeting, ben, gurion, reacted, to, what, he, had, been, just, told, by, a, delegation, from, jerusalem, he, points, out, that, this, view, that, ben, gurion, had, planned, to, conquer, the, west, bank, is, unsubstantiated, in, both, ben, gurion, s, diary, and, in, the, cabinet, protocol, the, topic, came, back, at, the, end, of, the, 1948, war, when, general, yigal, allon, also, proposed, the, conquest, of, the, west, bank, up, to, the, jordan, river, as, the, natural, defensible, border, of, the, state, this, time, ben, gurion, refused, although, he, was, aware, that, the, idf, was, militarily, strong, enough, to, carry, out, the, conquest, he, feared, the, reaction, of, western, powers, and, wanted, to, maintain, good, relations, with, the, united, states, and, not, to, provoke, the, british, moreover, in, his, opinion, the, results, of, the, war, were, already, satisfactory, and, israeli, leaders, had, to, focus, on, the, building, of, a, nation, according, to, benny, morris, ben, gurion, got, cold, feet, during, the, war, if, had, carried, out, a, large, expulsion, and, cleansed, the, whole, country, the, whole, land, of, israel, as, far, as, the, jordan, river, it, may, yet, turn, out, that, this, was, his, fatal, mistake, if, he, had, carried, out, a, full, expulsion, rather, than, a, partial, one, he, would, have, stabilized, the, state, of, israel, for, generations, in, order, to, prevent, the, coalescence, of, the, religious, right, the, histadrut, agreed, to, a, vague, status, quo, agreement, with, mizrahi, in, 1935, ben, gurion, was, aware, that, world, jewry, could, and, would, only, feel, comfortable, to, throw, their, support, behind, the, nascent, state, if, it, was, shrouded, with, religious, mystique, that, would, include, an, orthodox, tacit, acquiescence, to, the, entity, therefore, in, september, 1947, ben, gurion, decided, to, reach, a, formal, status, quo, agreement, with, the, orthodox, agudat, yisrael, party, he, sent, a, letter, to, agudat, yisrael, stating, that, while, being, committed, to, establishing, a, non, theocratic, state, with, freedom, of, religion, he, promised, that, the, shabbat, would, be, israel, s, official, day, of, rest, that, in, state, provided, kitchens, there, would, be, access, to, kosher, food, that, every, effort, would, be, made, to, provide, a, single, jurisdiction, for, jewish, family, affairs, and, that, each, sector, would, be, granted, autonomy, in, the, sphere, of, education, provided, minimum, standards, regarding, the, curriculum, be, observed, to, a, large, extent, this, agreement, provided, the, framework, for, religious, affairs, in, israel, till, the, present, day, and, is, often, used, as, a, benchmark, regarding, the, arrangement, of, religious, affairs, in, israel, ben, gurion, described, himself, as, an, irreligious, person, who, developed, atheism, in, his, youth, and, who, demonstrated, no, great, sympathy, for, the, elements, of, traditional, judaism, though, he, quoted, the, bible, extensively, in, his, speeches, and, writings, modern, orthodox, philosopher, yeshayahu, leibowitz, considered, ben, gurion, to, have, hated, judaism, more, than, any, other, man, he, had, met, he, was, proud, of, the, fact, that, he, had, only, set, foot, in, a, synagogue, once, in, israel, worked, on, yom, kippur, and, ate, pork, in, later, time, ben, gurion, refused, to, define, himself, as, secular, and, he, regarded, himself, a, believer, in, god, in, a, 1970, interview, he, described, himself, as, a, pantheist, and, stated, that, i, don, t, know, if, there, s, an, afterlife, i, think, there, is, in, 1969, he, combined, his, zionism, with, a, moderate, religious, view, in, 1948, the, establishment, of, a, hebrew, state, and, the, independence, of, israel, were, declared, because, our, people, were, sure, that, their, prayer, would, be, answered, if, they, would, return, to, the, land, during, an, interview, with, the, leftist, weekly, hotam, two, years, before, his, death, he, revealed, i, too, have, a, deep, faith, in, the, almighty, i, believe, in, one, god, the, omnipotent, creator, my, consciousness, is, aware, of, the, existence, of, material, and, spirit, i, cannot, understand, how, order, reigns, in, nature, in, the, world, and, universe, unless, there, exists, a, superior, force, this, supreme, creator, is, beyond, my, comprehension, but, it, directs, everything, in, a, letter, to, the, writer, eliezer, steinman, he, wrote, today, more, than, ever, the, religious, tend, to, relegate, judaism, to, observing, dietary, laws, and, preserving, the, sabbath, this, is, considered, religious, reform, i, prefer, the, fifteenth, psalm, lovely, are, the, psalms, of, israel, the, shulchan, aruch, is, a, product, of, our, nation, s, life, in, the, exile, it, was, produced, in, the, exile, in, conditions, of, exile, a, nation, in, the, process, of, fulfilling, its, every, task, physically, and, spiritually, must, compose, a, new, shulchan, and, our, nation, s, intellectuals, are, required, in, my, opinion, to, fulfill, their, responsibility, in, this, during, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, ben, gurion, oversaw, the, nascent, state, s, military, operations, during, the, first, weeks, of, israel, s, independence, he, ordered, all, militias, to, be, replaced, by, one, national, army, the, israel, defense, forces, idf, to, that, end, ben, gurion, used, a, firm, hand, during, the, altalena, affair, a, ship, carrying, arms, purchased, by, the, irgun, led, by, menachem, begin, he, insisted, that, all, weapons, be, handed, over, to, the, idf, when, fighting, broke, out, on, the, tel, aviv, beach, he, ordered, it, be, taken, by, force, and, to, shell, the, ship, sixteen, irgun, fighters, and, three, idf, soldiers, were, killed, in, this, battle, following, the, policy, of, a, unified, military, force, he, also, ordered, that, the, palmach, headquarters, be, disbanded, and, its, units, be, integrated, with, the, rest, of, the, idf, to, the, chagrin, of, many, of, its, members, by, absorbing, the, irgun, force, into, israel, s, idf, the, israelis, eliminated, competition, and, the, central, government, controlled, all, military, forces, within, the, country, his, attempts, to, reduce, the, number, of, mapam, members, in, the, senior, ranks, led, to, the, generals, revolt, in, june, 1948, as, head, of, the, jewish, agency, from, 1935, ben, gurion, was, de, facto, leader, of, the, jewish, population, even, before, the, state, was, declared, in, this, position, ben, gurion, played, a, major, role, in, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, when, the, idf, archives, and, others, were, opened, in, the, late, 1980s, scholars, started, to, reconsider, the, events, and, the, role, of, ben, gurion, david, ben, gurion, knew, about, and, supported, israel, s, biological, warfare, poisoning, operations, against, palestinian, civilians, during, the, 1948, war, the, poisoning, operations, involved, targeting, dozens, of, palestinian, water, wells, with, typhoid, and, dysentery, bacteria, as, well, as, the, aqueducts, in, palestinian, cities, such, as, acre, these, operations, caused, mass, infections, plan, dalet, was, a, plan, worked, out, by, the, haganah, in, mandatory, palestine, in, march, 1948, requested, by, ben, gurion, consisting, of, a, set, of, guidelines, to, take, control, of, mandatory, palestine, declare, a, jewish, state, and, defend, its, borders, and, people, including, the, jewish, population, outside, of, the, borders, before, and, in, anticipation, of, the, invasion, by, regular, arab, armies, according, to, the, israeli, yehoshafat, harkabi, plan, dalet, called, for, the, conquest, of, arab, towns, and, villages, inside, and, along, the, borders, of, the, area, allocated, to, the, proposed, jewish, state, in, the, un, partition, plan, in, case, of, resistance, the, population, of, conquered, villages, was, to, be, expelled, outside, the, borders, of, the, jewish, state, if, no, resistance, was, met, the, residents, could, stay, put, under, military, rule, the, intent, of, plan, dalet, is, subject, to, much, controversy, with, historians, on, one, side, asserting, that, it, was, entirely, defensive, while, other, historians, assert, that, the, plan, aimed, at, the, expulsion, sometimes, called, an, ethnic, cleansing, on, the, grounds, that, this, was, an, integral, part, of, a, planned, strategy, on, 14, may, 1948, on, the, last, day, of, the, british, mandate, ben, gurion, declared, the, independence, of, the, state, of, israel, in, the, israeli, declaration, of, independence, he, stated, that, the, new, nation, would, uphold, the, full, social, and, political, equality, of, all, its, citizens, without, distinction, of, religion, race, in, his, war, diaries, in, february, 1948, ben, gurion, wrote, the, war, shall, give, us, the, land, the, concepts, of, ours, and, not, ours, are, peace, concepts, only, and, they, lose, their, meaning, during, war, also, later, he, confirmed, this, by, stating, that, in, the, negev, we, shall, not, buy, the, land, we, shall, conquer, it, you, forget, that, we, are, at, war, the, arabs, meanwhile, also, vied, with, israel, over, the, control, of, territory, by, means, of, war, while, the, jordanian, arab, legion, had, decided, to, concentrate, its, forces, in, bethlehem, and, in, hebron, in, order, to, save, that, district, for, its, arab, inhabitants, and, to, prevent, territorial, gains, for, israel, israeli, historian, benny, morris, has, written, of, the,

him, from, resigning, his, political, isolation, suspicion, of, colleagues, and, rivals, apparent, inability, to, interact, with, the, full, spectrum, of, reality, and, belief, that, his, life, s, work, was, disintegrating, his, resignation, was, not, an, act, of, farewell, but, another, act, of, his, personal, struggle, and, possibly, an, indication, of, his, mental, state, ben, gurion, chose, levi, eshkol, as, his, successor, a, year, later, a, bitter, rivalry, developed, between, the, two, on, the, issue, of, the, lavon, affair, a, failed, 1954, israeli, covert, operation, in, egypt, ben, gurion, had, insisted, that, the, operation, be, properly, investigated, while, eshkol, refused, after, failing, to, unseat, eshkol, as, mapai, party, leader, in, the, 1965, mapai, leadership, election, ben, gurion, subsequently, broke, with, mapai, in, june, 1965, and, formed, a, new, party, rafi, while, mapai, merged, with, ahdut, haavoda, to, form, alignment, with, eshkol, as, its, head,
