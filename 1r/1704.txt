stephen, jay, gould, u, l, d, goold, september, 10, 1941, may, 20, 2002, was, an, american, paleontologist, evolutionary, biologist, and, historian, of, science, he, was, one, of, the, most, influential, and, widely, read, authors, of, popular, science, of, his, generation, gould, spent, most, of, his, career, teaching, at, harvard, university, and, working, at, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, new, york, in, 1996, gould, was, hired, as, the, vincent, astor, visiting, research, professor, of, biology, at, new, york, university, after, which, he, divided, his, time, teaching, between, there, and, harvard, gould, s, most, significant, contribution, to, evolutionary, biology, was, the, theory, of, punctuated, equilibrium, developed, with, niles, eldredge, in, 1972, the, theory, proposes, that, most, evolution, is, characterized, by, long, periods, of, evolutionary, stability, infrequently, punctuated, by, swift, periods, of, branching, speciation, the, theory, was, contrasted, against, phyletic, gradualism, the, popular, idea, that, evolutionary, change, is, marked, by, a, pattern, of, smooth, and, continuous, change, in, the, fossil, record, most, of, gould, s, empirical, research, was, based, on, the, land, snail, genera, poecilozonites, and, cerion, he, also, made, important, contributions, to, evolutionary, developmental, biology, receiving, broad, professional, recognition, for, his, book, ontogeny, and, phylogeny, in, evolutionary, theory, he, opposed, strict, selectionism, sociobiology, as, applied, to, humans, and, evolutionary, psychology, he, campaigned, against, creationism, and, proposed, that, science, and, religion, should, be, considered, two, distinct, fields, or, non, overlapping, magisteria, whose, authorities, do, not, overlap, gould, was, known, by, the, general, public, mainly, for, his, 300, popular, essays, in, natural, history, magazine, and, his, numerous, books, written, for, both, the, specialist, and, non, specialist, in, april, 2000, the, us, library, of, congress, named, him, a, living, legend, stephen, jay, gould, was, born, in, queens, new, york, on, september, 10, 1941, his, father, leonard, was, a, court, stenographer, and, a, world, war, ii, veteran, in, the, united, states, navy, his, mother, eleanor, was, an, artist, whose, parents, were, jewish, immigrants, living, and, working, in, the, city, s, garment, district, gould, and, his, younger, brother, peter, were, raised, in, bayside, a, middle, class, neighborhood, in, the, northeastern, section, of, queens, he, attended, p, s, 26, elementary, school, and, graduated, from, jamaica, high, school, when, gould, was, five, years, old, his, father, took, him, to, the, hall, of, dinosaurs, in, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, where, he, first, encountered, tyrannosaurus, rex, i, had, no, idea, there, were, such, things, i, was, awestruck, gould, once, recalled, it, was, in, that, moment, that, he, decided, to, become, a, paleontologist, raised, in, a, secular, jewish, home, gould, did, not, formally, practice, religion, and, preferred, to, be, called, an, agnostic, when, asked, directly, if, he, was, an, agnostic, in, skeptic, magazine, he, responded, if, you, absolutely, forced, me, to, bet, on, the, existence, of, a, conventional, anthropomorphic, deity, of, course, i, d, bet, no, but, basically, huxley, was, right, when, he, said, that, agnosticism, is, the, only, honorable, position, because, we, really, cannot, know, and, that, s, right, i, d, be, real, surprised, if, there, turned, out, to, be, a, conventional, god, though, he, had, been, brought, up, by, a, marxist, father, he, stated, that, his, father, s, politics, were, very, different, from, his, own, in, describing, his, own, political, views, he, has, said, they, tend, to, the, left, of, center, according, to, gould, the, most, influential, political, books, he, read, were, c, wright, mills, the, power, elite, and, the, political, writings, of, noam, chomsky, while, attending, antioch, college, in, yellow, springs, ohio, in, the, early, 1960s, gould, was, active, in, the, civil, rights, movement, and, often, campaigned, for, social, justice, when, he, attended, the, university, of, leeds, as, a, visiting, undergraduate, he, organized, weekly, demonstrations, outside, a, bradford, dance, hall, which, refused, to, admit, black, people, gould, continued, these, demonstrations, until, the, policy, was, revoked, throughout, his, career, and, writings, he, spoke, out, against, cultural, oppression, in, all, its, forms, especially, what, he, saw, as, the, pseudoscience, used, in, the, service, of, racism, and, sexism, interspersed, throughout, his, scientific, essays, for, natural, history, magazine, gould, frequently, referred, to, his, non, scientific, interests, and, pastimes, as, a, boy, he, collected, baseball, cards, and, remained, an, avid, new, york, yankees, fan, throughout, his, life, as, an, adult, he, was, fond, of, science, fiction, movies, but, often, lamented, their, poor, storytelling, and, presentation, of, science, his, other, interests, included, singing, baritone, in, the, boston, cecilia, and, he, was, a, great, aficionado, of, gilbert, and, sullivan, operas, he, collected, rare, antiquarian, books, possessed, an, enthusiasm, for, architecture, and, delighted, in, city, walks, he, often, traveled, to, europe, and, spoke, french, german, russian, and, italian, he, sometimes, alluded, ruefully, to, his, tendency, to, put, on, weight, gould, married, artist, deborah, lee, on, october, 3, 1965, gould, met, lee, while, they, were, students, together, at, antioch, college, they, had, two, sons, jesse, and, ethan, and, were, married, for, 30, years, his, second, marriage, in, 1995, was, to, artist, and, sculptor, rhonda, roland, shearer, in, july, 1982, gould, was, diagnosed, with, peritoneal, mesothelioma, a, deadly, form, of, cancer, affecting, the, abdominal, lining, the, peritoneum, this, cancer, is, frequently, found, in, people, who, have, ingested, or, inhaled, asbestos, fibers, a, mineral, which, was, used, in, the, construction, of, harvard, s, museum, of, comparative, zoology, after, a, difficult, two, year, recovery, gould, published, a, column, for, discover, magazine, in, 1985, titled, the, median, isn, t, the, message, which, discusses, his, reaction, to, reading, that, mesothelioma, is, incurable, with, a, median, mortality, of, only, eight, months, after, discovery, in, his, essay, he, describes, the, actual, significance, behind, this, fact, and, his, relief, upon, recognizing, that, statistical, averages, are, useful, abstractions, and, by, themselves, do, not, encompass, our, actual, world, of, variation, shadings, and, continua, gould, was, also, an, advocate, of, medical, cannabis, when, undergoing, his, cancer, treatments, he, smoked, marijuana, to, help, alleviate, the, long, periods, of, intense, and, uncontrollable, nausea, according, to, gould, the, drug, had, a, most, important, effect, on, his, eventual, recovery, he, later, complained, that, he, could, not, understand, how, any, humane, person, would, withhold, such, a, beneficial, substance, from, people, in, such, great, need, simply, because, others, use, it, for, different, purposes, on, august, 5, 1998, gould, s, testimony, assisted, in, the, successful, lawsuit, of, hiv, activist, jim, wakeford, who, sued, the, government, of, canada, for, the, right, to, cultivate, possess, and, use, marijuana, for, medical, purposes, in, february, 2002, a, 3, centimeter, 1, 2, in, lesion, was, found, on, gould, s, chest, radiograph, and, oncologists, diagnosed, him, with, stage, iv, cancer, gould, died, 10, weeks, later, on, may, 20, 2002, from, a, metastatic, adenocarcinoma, of, the, lung, an, aggressive, form, of, cancer, which, had, already, spread, to, his, brain, liver, and, spleen, this, cancer, was, unrelated, to, his, previous, bout, of, abdominal, cancer, in, 1982, though, it, is, also, associated, with, asbestos, exposure, he, died, in, his, home, in, a, bed, set, up, in, the, library, of, his, soho, loft, surrounded, by, his, wife, rhonda, his, mother, eleanor, and, the, many, books, he, loved, gould, began, his, higher, education, at, antioch, college, graduating, with, a, double, major, in, geology, and, philosophy, in, 1963, during, this, time, he, also, studied, at, the, university, of, leeds, in, the, united, kingdom, after, completing, graduate, work, at, columbia, university, in, 1967, under, the, guidance, of, norman, newell, he, was, immediately, hired, by, harvard, university, where, he, worked, until, the, end, of, his, life, 1967, 2002, in, 1973, harvard, promoted, him, to, professor, of, geology, and, curator, of, invertebrate, paleontology, at, the, institution, s, museum, of, comparative, zoology, in, 1982, harvard, awarded, him, the, title, of, alexander, agassiz, professor, of, zoology, that, same, year, he, received, the, golden, plate, award, of, the, american, academy, of, achievement, in, 1983, he, was, awarded, a, fellowship, at, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, where, he, later, served, as, president, 1999, 2001, the, aaas, news, release, cited, his, numerous, contributions, to, both, scientific, progress, and, the, public, understanding, of, science, he, also, served, as, president, of, the, paleontological, society, 1985, 1986, and, of, the, society, for, the, study, of, evolution, 1990, 1991, in, 1989, gould, was, elected, into, the, body, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, through, 1996, 2002, gould, was, vincent, astor, visiting, research, professor, of, biology, at, new, york, university, in, 2001, the, american, humanist, association, named, him, the, humanist, of, the, year, for, his, lifetime, of, work, in, 2008, he, was, posthumously, awarded, the, darwin, wallace, medal, along, with, 12, other, recipients, until, 2008, this, medal, had, been, awarded, every, 50, years, by, the, linnean, society, of, london, early, in, his, career, gould, and, his, colleague, niles, eldredge, developed, the, theory, of, punctuated, equilibrium, which, describes, the, rate, of, speciation, in, the, fossil, record, as, occurring, relatively, rapidly, which, then, alternates, to, a, longer, period, of, evolutionary, stability, it, was, gould, who, coined, the, term, punctuated, equilibria, though, the, theory, was, originally, presented, by, eldredge, in, his, doctoral, dissertation, on, devonian, trilobites, and, his, article, published, the, previous, year, on, allopatric, speciation, according, to, gould, punctuated, equilibrium, revised, a, key, pillar, in, the, central, logic, of, darwinian, theory, some, evolutionary, biologists, have, argued, that, while, punctuated, equilibrium, was, of, great, interest, to, biology, generally, it, merely, modified, neo, darwinism, in, a, manner, that, was, fully, compatible, with, what, had, been, known, before, other, biologists, emphasize, the, theoretical, novelty, of, punctuated, equilibrium, and, argued, that, evolutionary, stasis, had, been, unexpected, by, most, evolutionary, biologists, and, had, a, major, impact, on, paleontology, and, evolutionary, biology, comparisons, were, made, to, george, gaylord, simpson, s, work, in, tempo, and, mode, in, evolution, 1941, in, which, he, also, illustrated, relatively, sudden, changes, along, evolutionary, lines, simpson, describes, the, paleontological, record, as, being, characterized, by, predominantly, gradual, change, which, he, termed, horotely, although, he, also, documented, examples, of, slow, bradytely, and, rapid, tachytely, rates, of, evolution, punctuated, equilibrium, and, phyletic, gradualism, are, not, mutually, exclusive, as, simpson, s, work, demonstrates, and, examples, of, each, have, been, documented, in, different, lineages, the, debate, between, these, two, models, is, often, misunderstood, by, non, scientists, and, according, to, richard, dawkins, has, been, oversold, by, the, media, some, critics, jokingly, referred, to, the, theory, of, punctuated, equilibrium, as, evolution, by, jerks, which, prompted, gould, to, describe, phyletic, gradualism, as, evolution, by, creeps, gould, made, significant, contributions, to, evolutionary, developmental, biology, especially, in, his, work, ontogeny, and, phylogeny, in, this, book, he, emphasized, the, process, of, heterochrony, which, encompasses, two, distinct, processes, neoteny, and, terminal, additions, neoteny, is, the, process, where, ontogeny, is, slowed, down, and, the, organism, does, not, reach, the, end, of, its, development, terminal, addition, is, the, process, by, which, an, organism, adds, to, its, development, by, speeding, and, shortening, earlier, stages, in, the, developmental, process, gould, s, influence, in, the, field, of, evolutionary, developmental, biology, continues, to, be, seen, today, in, areas, such, as, the, evolution, of, feathers, gould, was, a, champion, of, biological, constraints, internal, limitations, upon, developmental, pathways, as, well, as, other, non, selectionist, forces, in, evolution, rather, than, direct, adaptations, he, considered, many, higher, functions, of, the, human, brain, to, be, the, unintended, side, consequence, of, natural, selection, to, describe, such, co, opted, features, he, coined, the, term, exaptation, with, paleontologist, elisabeth, vrba, gould, believed, this, feature, of, human, mentality, undermines, an, essential, premise, of, human, sociobiology, and, evolutionary, psychology, in, 1975, gould, s, harvard, colleague, e, o, wilson, introduced, his, analysis, of, animal, behavior, including, human, behavior, based, on, a, sociobiological, framework, that, suggested, that, many, social, behaviors, have, a, strong, evolutionary, basis, in, response, gould, richard, lewontin, and, others, from, the, boston, area, wrote, the, subsequently, well, referenced, letter, to, the, new, york, review, of, books, entitled, against, sociobiology, this, open, letter, criticized, wilson, s, notion, of, a, deterministic, view, of, human, society, and, human, action, but, gould, did, not, rule, out, sociobiological, explanations, for, many, aspects, of, animal, behavior, and, later, wrote, sociobiologists, have, broadened, their, range, of, selective, stories, by, invoking, concepts, of, inclusive, fitness, and, kin, selection, to, solve, successfully, i, think, the, vexatious, problem, of, altruism, previously, the, greatest, stumbling, block, to, a, darwinian, theory, of, social, behavior, here, sociobiology, has, had, and, will, continue, to, have, success, and, here, i, wish, it, well, for, it, represents, an, extension, of, basic, darwinism, to, a, realm, where, it, should, apply, with, richard, lewontin, gould, wrote, an, influential, 1979, paper, entitled, the, spandrels, of, san, marco, and, the, panglossian, paradigm, which, introduced, the, architectural, term, spandrel, into, evolutionary, biology, in, architecture, a, spandrel, is, a, triangular, space, which, exists, over, the, haunches, of, an, arch, spandrels, more, often, called, pendentives, in, this, context, are, found, particularly, in, classical, architecture, especially, byzantine, and, renaissance, churches, when, visiting, venice, in, 1978, gould, noted, that, the, spandrels, of, the, san, marco, cathedral, while, quite, beautiful, were, not, spaces, planned, by, the, architect, rather, the, spaces, arise, as, necessary, architectural, byproducts, of, mounting, a, dome, on, rounded, arches, gould, and, lewontin, thus, defined, spandrels, in, the, evolutionary, biology, context, to, mean, any, biological, feature, of, an, organism, that, arises, as, a, necessary, side, consequence, of, other, features, which, is, not, directly, selected, for, by, natural, selection, proposed, examples, include, the, masculinized, genitalia, in, female, hyenas, exaptive, use, of, an, umbilicus, as, a, brooding, chamber, by, snails, the, shoulder, hump, of, the, giant, irish, deer, and, several, key, features, of, human, mentality, in, voltaire, s, candide, dr, pangloss, is, portrayed, as, a, clueless, scholar, who, despite, the, evidence, insists, that, all, is, for, the, best, in, this, best, of, all, possible, worlds, gould, and, lewontin, asserted, that, it, is, panglossian, for, evolutionary, biologists, to, view, all, traits, as, atomized, things, that, had, been, naturally, selected, for, and, criticised, biologists, for, not, granting, theoretical, space, to, other, causes, such, as, phyletic, and, developmental, constraints, the, relative, frequency, of, spandrels, so, defined, versus, adaptive, features, in, nature, remains, a, controversial, topic, in, evolutionary, biology, an, illustrative, example, of, gould, s, approach, can, be, found, in, elisabeth, lloyd, s, case, study, suggesting, that, the, female, orgasm, is, a, by, product, of, shared, developmental, pathways, gould, also, wrote, on, this, topic, in, his, essay, male, nipples, and, clitoral, ripples, prompted, by, lloyd, s, earlier, work, gould, was, criticized, by, philosopher, daniel, dennett, for, using, the, term, spandrel, instead, of, pendentive, a, spandrel, that, curves, across, a, right, angle, to, support, a, dome, robert, mark, a, professor, of, civil, engineering, at, princeton, offered, his, expertise, in, the, pages, of, american, scientist, noting, that, these, definitions, are, often, misunderstood, in, architectural, theory, mark, concluded, gould, and, lewontin, s, misapplication, of, the, term, spandrel, for, pendentive, perhaps, implies, a, wider, latitude, of, design, choice, than, they, intended, for, their, analogy, but, dennett, s, critique, of, the, architectural, basis, of, the, analogy, goes, even, further, astray, because, he, slights, the, technical, rationale, of, the, architectural, elements, in, question, gould, favored, the, argument, that, evolution, has, no, inherent, drive, towards, long, term, progress, uncritical, commentaries, often, portray, evolution, as, a, ladder, of, progress, leading, towards, bigger, faster, and, smarter, organisms, the, assumption, being, that, evolution, is, somehow, driving, organisms, to, get, more, complex, and, ultimately, more, like, humankind, gould, argued, that, evolution, s, drive, was, not, towards, complexity, but, towards, diversification, because, life, is, constrained, to, begin, with, a, simple, starting, point, like, bacteria, any, diversity, resulting, from, this, start, by, random, walk, will, have, a, skewed, distribution, and, therefore, be, perceived, to, move, in, the, direction, of, higher, complexity, but, life, gould, argued, can, also, easily, adapt, towards, simplification, as, is, often, the, case, with, parasites, in, a, review, of, full, house, richard, dawkins, approved, of, gould, s, general, argument, but, suggested, that, he, saw, evidence, of, a, tendency, for, lineages, to, improve, cumulatively, their, adaptive, fit, to, their, particular, way, of, life, by, increasing, the, numbers, of, features, which, combine, together, in, adaptive, complexes, by, this, definition, adaptive, evolution, is, not, just, incidentally, progressive, it, is, deeply, dyed, in, the, wool, indispensably, progressive, gould, s, arguments, against, progress, in, evolutionary, biology, did, not, extend, towards, a, notion, of, progress, in, general, or, notions, of, cultural, evolution, in, full, house, gould, compares, two, notions, of, progress, against, one, another, while, the, first, concept, of, progress, evolutionary, progress, is, argued, to, be, invalid, for, a, number, of, biological, considerations, gould, permits, that, evolution, may, operate, in, human, cultural, evolution, through, a, lamarckian, mechanism, gould, goes, on, to, argue, that, the, disappearance, of, the, 0, 400, batting, average, in, baseball, is, paradoxically, due, to, the, inclusion, of, better, players, in, the, league, rather, than, players, becoming, worse, over, time, in, his, view, such, a, process, is, likely, reflective, in, a, number, of, cultural, phenomena, including, sports, the, visual, arts, and, music, where, unlike, in, biological, systems, the, realm, of, aesthetic, possibilities, is, constrained, by, a, right, wall, of, human, limits, and, aesthetic, preferences, gould, later, goes, on, to, state, that, his, arguments, for, biological, evolution, should, not, be, applied, to, cultural, change, lest, they, be, employed, by, so, called, political, correctness, as, a, doctrine, that, celebrates, all, indigenous, practice, and, therefore, permits, no, distinctions, judgements, or, analyses, gould, never, embraced, cladistics, as, a, method, of, investigating, evolutionary, lineages, and, process, possibly, because, he, was, concerned, that, such, investigations, would, lead, to, neglect, of, the, details, in, historical, biology, which, he, considered, all, important, in, the, early, 1990s, this, led, him, into, a, debate, with, derek, briggs, who, had, begun, to, apply, quantitative, cladistic, techniques, to, the, burgess, shale, fossils, about, the, methods, to, be, used, in, interpreting, these, fossils, around, this, time, cladistics, rapidly, became, the, dominant, method, of, classification, in, evolutionary, biology, inexpensive, but, increasingly, powerful, personal, computers, made, it, possible, to, process, large, quantities, of, data, about, organisms, and, their, characteristics, around, the, same, time, the, development, of, effective, polymerase, chain, reaction, techniques, made, it, possible, to, apply, cladistic, methods, of, analysis, to, biochemical, and, genetic, features, as, well, most, of, gould, s, empirical, research, pertained, to, land, snails, he, focused, his, early, work, on, the, bermudian, genus, poecilozonites, while, his, later, work, concentrated, on, the, west, indian, genus, cerion, according, to, gould, cerion, is, the, land, snail, of, maximal, diversity, in, form, throughout, the, entire, world, there, are, 600, described, species, of, this, single, genus, in, fact, they, re, not, really, species, they, all, interbreed, but, the, names, exist, to, express, a, real, phenomenon, which, is, this, incredible, morphological, diversity, some, are, shaped, like, golf, balls, some, are, shaped, like, pencils, now, my, main, subject, is, the, evolution, of, form, and, the, problem, of, how, it, is, that, you, can, get, this, diversity, amid, so, little, genetic, difference, so, far, as, we, can, tell, is, a, very, interesting, one, and, if, we, could, solve, this, we, d, learn, something, general, about, the, evolution, of, form, given, cerion, s, extensive, geographic, diversity, gould, later, lamented, that, if, christopher, columbus, had, only, catalogued, a, single, cerion, it, would, have, ended, the, scholarly, debate, about, which, island, columbus, had, first, set, foot, on, in, america, gould, is, one, of, the, most, frequently, cited, scientists, in, the, field, of, evolutionary, theory, his, 1979, spandrels, paper, has, been, cited, more, than, 5, 000, times, in, paleobiology, the, flagship, journal, of, his, own, speciality, only, charles, darwin, and, george, gaylord, simpson, have, been, cited, more, often, gould, was, also, a, considerably, respected, historian, of, science, historian, ronald, numbers, has, been, quoted, as, saying, i, can, t, say, much, about, gould, s, strengths, as, a, scientist, but, for, a, long, time, i, ve, regarded, him, as, the, second, most, influential, historian, of, science, next, to, thomas, kuhn, gould, s, undergraduate, course, science, b, 16, history, of, the, earth, and, life, was, taught, in, a, harvard, science, center, lecture, hall, with, a, 250, seat, capacity, science, b, 16, was, so, oversubscribed, that, an, annual, lottery, was, held, to, see, which, students, would, be, allowed, to, enroll, in, the, course, if, a, student, was, denied, course, enrollment, three, times, then, their, fourth, entry, into, the, lottery, provided, them, with, a, guaranteed, seat, in, the, class, shortly, before, his, death, gould, published, the, structure, of, evolutionary, theory, 2002, a, long, treatise, recapitulating, his, version, of, modern, evolutionary, theory, in, an, interview, for, the, dutch, tv, series, of, beauty, and, consolation, gould, remarked, in, a, couple, of, years, i, will, be, able, to, gather, in, one, volume, my, view, of, how, evolution, works, it, is, to, me, a, great, consolation, because, it, represents, the, putting, together, of, a, lifetime, of, thinking, into, one, source, that, book, will, never, be, particularly, widely, read, it, s, going, to, be, far, too, long, and, it, s, only, for, a, few, thousand, professionals, very, different, from, my, popular, science, writings, but, it, is, of, greater, consolation, to, me, because, it, is, a, chance, to, put, into, one, place, a, whole, way, of, thinking, about, evolution, that, i, ve, struggled, with, all, my, life, gould, became, widely, known, through, his, popular, essays, on, evolution, in, the, natural, history, magazine, his, essays, were, published, in, a, series, entitled, this, view, of, life, a, phrase, from, the, concluding, paragraph, of, charles, darwin, s, origin, of, species, from, january, 1974, to, january, 2001, amounting, to, a, continuous, publication, of, 300, essays, many, of, his, essays, were, reprinted, in, collected, volumes, that, became, bestselling, books, such, as, ever, since, darwin, and, the, panda, s, thumb, hen, s, teeth, and, horse, s, toes, and, the, flamingo, s, smile, a, passionate, advocate, of, evolutionary, theory, gould, wrote, prolifically, on, the, subject, trying, to, communicate, his, understanding, of, contemporary, evolutionary, biology, to, a, wide, audience, a, recurring, theme, in, his, writings, is, the, history, and, development, of, pre, evolutionary, and, evolutionary, thought, he, was, also, an, enthusiastic, baseball, fan, and, sabermetrician, analyst, of, baseball, statistics, and, made, frequent, reference, to, the, sport, in, his, essays, many, of, his, baseball, essays, were, anthologized, in, his, posthumously, published, book, triumph, and, tragedy, in, mudville, 2003, although, a, self, described, darwinist, gould, s, emphasis, was, less, gradualist, and, reductionist, than, most, neo, darwinists, he, fiercely, opposed, many, aspects, of, sociobiology, and, its, intellectual, descendant, evolutionary, psychology, he, devoted, considerable, time, to, fighting, against, creationism, creation, science, and, intelligent, design, most, notably, gould, provided, expert, testimony, against, the, equal, time, creationism, law, in, mclean, v, arkansas, gould, later, developed, the, term, non, overlapping, magisteria, noma, to, describe, how, in, his, view, science, and, religion, should, not, comment, on, each, other, s, realm, gould, went, on, to, develop, this, idea, in, some, detail, particularly, in, the, books, rocks, of, ages, 1999, and, the, hedgehog, the, fox, and, the, magister, s, pox, 2003, in, a, 1982, essay, for, natural, history, gould, wrote, our, failure, to, discern, a, universal, good, does, not, record, any, lack, of, insight, or, ingenuity, but, merely, demonstrates, that, nature, contains, no, moral, messages, framed, in, human, terms, morality, is, a, subject, for, philosophers, theologians, students, of, the, humanities, indeed, for, all, thinking, people, the, answers, will, not, be, read, passively, from, nature, they, do, not, and, cannot, arise, from, the, data, of, science, the, factual, state, of, the, world, does, not, teach, us, how, we, with, our, powers, for, good, and, evil, should, alter, or, preserve, it, in, the, most, ethical, manner, gould, also, spoke, out, against, creationist, misuse, of, his, work, and, theory, especially, with, respect, to, how, his, theory, of, punctuated, equilibrium, relates, to, the, presence, of, transitional, fossils, or, forms, it, is, infuriating, to, be, quoted, again, and, again, by, creationists, whether, through, design, or, stupidity, i, do, not, know, as, admitting, that, the, fossil, record, includes, no, transitional, forms, transitional, forms, are, generally, lacking, at, the, species, level, but, are, abundant, between, larger, groups, the, evolution, from, reptiles, to, mammals, is, well, documented, an, anti, evolution, petition, drafted, by, the, discovery, institute, inspired, the, national, center, for, science, education, to, create, a, pro, evolution, counterpart, called, project, steve, which, is, named, in, gould, s, honor, in, 2011, the, executive, council, of, the, committee, for, skeptical, inquiry, csi, selected, gould, for, inclusion, in, csi, s, pantheon, of, skeptics, created, to, remember, the, legacy, of, deceased, csi, fellows, and, their, contributions, to, the, cause, of, scientific, skepticism, gould, also, became, a, noted, public, face, of, science, often, appearing, on, television, in, 1984, gould, received, his, own, nova, special, on, pbs, other, appearances, included, interviews, on, cnn, s, crossfire, and, talkback, live, nbc, s, the, today, show, and, regular, appearances, on, pbs, s, charlie, rose, show, gould, was, also, a, guest, in, all, seven, episodes, of, the, dutch, talk, series, a, glorious, accident, in, which, he, appeared, with, his, close, friend, oliver, sacks, gould, was, featured, prominently, as, a, guest, in, ken, burns, s, pbs, documentary, baseball, as, well, as, pbs, s, evolution, series, gould, was, also, on, the, board, of, advisers, to, the, influential, children, s, television, workshop, television, show, 3, 2, 1, contact, where, he, made, frequent, guest, appearances, since, 2013, gould, has, been, listed, on, the, advisory, council, of, the, national, center, for, science, education, in, 1997, he, voiced, a, cartoon, version, of, himself, on, the, television, series, the, simpsons, in, the, episode, lisa, the, skeptic, lisa, finds, a, skeleton, that, many, people, believe, is, an, apocalyptic, angel, lisa, contacts, gould, and, asks, him, to, test, the, skeleton, s, dna, the, fossil, is, discovered, to, be, a, marketing, gimmick, for, a, new, mall, during, production, the, only, phrase, gould, objected, to, was, a, line, in, the, script, that, introduced, him, as, the, world, s, most, brilliant, paleontologist, in, 2002, the, show, paid, tribute, to, gould, after, his, death, dedicating, the, season, 13, finale, to, his, memory, gould, had, died, two, days, before, the, episode, aired, gould, received, many, accolades, for, his, scholarly, work, and, popular, expositions, of, natural, history, but, a, number, of, biologists, felt, his, public, presentations, were, out, of, step, with, mainstream, evolutionary, thinking, the, public, debates, between, gould, s, supporters, and, detractors, have, been, so, quarrelsome, that, they, have, been, dubbed, the, darwin, wars, by, several, commentators, john, maynard, smith, the, eminent, british, evolutionary, biologist, was, among, gould, s, strongest, critics, maynard, smith, thought, that, gould, misjudged, the, vital, role, of, adaptation, in, biology, and, was, critical, of, gould, s, acceptance, of, species, selection, as, a, major, component, of, biological, evolution, in, a, review, of, daniel, dennett, s, book, darwin, s, dangerous, idea, maynard, smith, wrote, that, gould, is, giving, non, biologists, a, largely, false, picture, of, the, state, of, evolutionary, theory, but, maynard, smith, was, not, consistently, negative, writing, in, a, review, of, the, panda, s, thumb, that, stephen, gould, is, the, best, writer, of, popular, science, now, active, often, he, infuriates, me, but, i, hope, he, will, go, right, on, writing, essays, like, these, maynard, smith, was, also, among, those, who, welcomed, gould, s, reinvigoration, of, evolutionary, paleontology, one, reason, for, criticism, was, that, gould, appeared, to, be, presenting, his, ideas, as, a, revolutionary, way, of, understanding, evolution, and, argued, for, the, importance, of, mechanisms, other, than, natural, selection, mechanisms, which, he, believed, had, been, ignored, by, many, professional, evolutionists, as, a, result, many, non, specialists, sometimes, inferred, from, his, early, writings, that, darwinian, explanations, had, been, proven, to, be, unscientific, which, gould, never, tried, to, imply, along, with, many, other, researchers, in, the, field, gould, s, works, were, sometimes, deliberately, taken, out, of, context, by, creationists, as, proof, that, scientists, no, longer, understood, how, organisms, evolved, gould, himself, corrected, some, of, these, misinterpretations, and, distortions, of, his, writings, in, later, works, the, conflicts, between, richard, dawkins, and, gould, were, popularized, by, philosopher, kim, sterelny, in, his, 2001, book, dawkins, vs, gould, sterelny, documents, their, disagreements, over, theoretical, issues, including, the, prominence, of, gene, selection, in, evolution, dawkins, argues, that, natural, selection, is, best, understood, as, competition, among, genes, or, replicators, while, gould, advocated, multi, level, selection, which, includes, selection, amongst, genes, nucleic, acid, sequences, cell, lineages, organisms, demes, species, and, clades, dawkins, accused, gould, of, deliberately, underplaying, the, differences, between, rapid, gradualism, and, macromutation, in, his, published, accounts, of, punctuated, equilibrium, he, also, devoted, entire, chapters, to, critiquing, gould, s, account, of, evolution, in, his, books, the, blind, watchmaker, and, unweaving, the, rainbow, as, did, daniel, dennett, in, his, 1995, book, darwin, s, dangerous, idea, other, biologists, contemporary, to, gould, went, further, as, in, the, case, of, robert, trivers, who, classified, it, as, intellectual, fraud, in, his, book, wonderful, life, 1989, gould, famously, described, the, cambrian, fauna, of, the, burgess, shale, emphasizing, their, bizarre, anatomical, designs, their, sudden, appearance, and, the, role, chance, played, in, determining, which, members, survived, he, used, the, cambrian, fauna, as, an, example, of, the, role, contingency, has, in, shaping, the, broader, pattern, of, evolution, his, view, of, contingency, was, criticized, by, simon, conway, morris, in, his, 1998, book, the, crucible, of, creation, conway, morris, stressed, members, of, the, cambrian, fauna, that, resemble, modern, taxa, he, also, argued, that, convergent, evolution, has, a, tendency, to, produce, similarities, of, organization, and, that, the, forms, of, life, are, restricted, and, channelled, in, his, book, life, s, solution, 2003, conway, morris, argued, that, the, appearance, of, human, like, animals, is, also, likely, paleontologist, richard, fortey, noted, that, prior, to, the, release, of, wonderful, life, conway, morris, shared, a, similar, thesis, to, gould, s, but, after, wonderful, life, conway, morris, revised, his, interpretation, and, adopted, a, more, deterministic, position, on, the, history, of, life, paleontologists, derek, briggs, and, richard, fortey, have, also, argued, that, much, of, the, cambrian, fauna, may, be, regarded, as, stem, groups, of, living, taxa, though, this, is, still, a, subject, of, intense, research, and, debate, and, the, relationship, of, many, cambrian, taxa, to, modern, phyla, has, not, been, established, in, the, eyes, of, many, palaeontologists, richard, dawkins, disagrees, with, the, view, that, new, phyla, suddenly, appeared, in, the, cambrian, arguing, that, for, a, new, phylum, to, spring, into, existence, what, actually, has, to, happen, on, the, ground, is, that, a, child, is, born, which, suddenly, out, of, the, blue, is, as, different, from, its, parents, as, a, snail, is, from, an, earthworm, no, zoologist, who, thinks, through, the, implications, not, even, the, most, ardent, saltationist, has, ever, supported, any, such, notion, in, the, structure, of, evolutionary, theory, gould, stresses, the, difference, between, phyletic, splitting, and, large, anatomical, transitions, noting, that, the, two, events, may, be, separated, by, millions, of, years, gould, argues, that, no, paleontologist, regards, the, cambrian, explosion, as, a, genealogical, event, that, is, as, the, actual, time, of, initial, splitting, but, rather, it, marks, an, anatomical, transition, in, the, overt, phenotypes, of, bilaterian, organisms, gould, also, had, a, long, running, public, feud, with, e, o, wilson, and, other, evolutionary, biologists, concerning, the, disciplines, of, human, sociobiology, and, evolutionary, psychology, both, of, which, gould, and, lewontin, opposed, but, which, richard, dawkins, daniel, dennett, and, steven, pinker, advocated, these, debates, reached, their, climax, in, the, 1970s, and, included, strong, opposition, from, groups, such, as, the, sociobiology, study, group, and, science, for, the, people, pinker, accuses, gould, lewontin, and, other, opponents, of, evolutionary, psychology, of, being, radical, scientists, whose, stance, on, human, nature, is, influenced, by, politics, rather, than, science, gould, stated, that, he, made, no, attribution, of, motive, in, wilson, s, or, anyone, else, s, case, but, cautioned, that, all, human, beings, are, influenced, especially, unconsciously, by, our, personal, expectations, and, biases, he, wrote, i, grew, up, in, a, family, with, a, tradition, of, participation, in, campaigns, for, social, justice, and, i, was, active, as, a, student, in, the, civil, rights, movement, at, a, time, of, great, excitement, and, success, in, the, early, 1960s, scholars, are, often, wary, of, citing, such, commitments, it, is, dangerous, for, a, scholar, even, to, imagine, that, he, might, attain, complete, neutrality, for, then, one, stops, being, vigilant, about, personal, preferences, and, their, influences, and, then, one, truly, falls, victim, to, the, dictates, of, prejudice, objectivity, must, be, operationally, defined, as, fair, treatment, of, data, not, absence, of, preference, gould, s, primary, criticism, held, that, human, sociobiological, explanations, lacked, evidential, support, and, argued, that, adaptive, behaviors, are, frequently, assumed, to, be, genetic, for, no, other, reason, than, their, supposed, universality, or, their, adaptive, nature, gould, emphasized, that, adaptive, behaviors, can, be, passed, on, through, culture, as, well, and, either, hypothesis, is, equally, plausible, gould, did, not, deny, the, relevance, of, biology, to, human, nature, but, reframed, the, debate, as, biological, potentiality, vs, biological, determinism, gould, stated, that, the, human, brain, allows, for, a, wide, range, of, behaviors, its, flexibility, permits, us, to, be, aggressive, or, peaceful, dominant, or, submissive, spiteful, or, generous, violence, sexism, and, general, nastiness, are, biological, since, they, represent, one, subset, of, a, possible, range, of, behaviors, but, peacefulness, equality, and, kindness, are, just, as, biological, and, we, may, see, their, influence, increase, if, we, can, create, social, structures, that, permit, them, to, flourish, gould, was, the, author, of, the, mismeasure, of, man, 1981, a, history, and, inquiry, of, psychometrics, and, intelligence, testing, generating, perhaps, the, greatest, controversy, of, all, his, books, and, receiving, both, widespread, praise, and, extensive, criticism, gould, investigated, the, methods, of, nineteenth, century, craniometry, as, well, as, the, history, of, psychological, testing, gould, wrote, that, both, theories, developed, from, an, unfounded, belief, in, biological, determinism, the, view, that, social, and, economic, differences, between, human, groups, primarily, races, classes, and, sexes, arise, from, inherited, inborn, distinctions, and, that, society, in, this, sense, is, an, accurate, reflection, of, biology, the, book, was, reprinted, in, 1996, with, the, addition, of, a, new, foreword, and, a, critical, review, of, the, bell, curve, in, 2011, a, study, conducted, by, six, anthropologists, criticized, gould, s, claim, that, samuel, morton, unconsciously, manipulated, his, skull, measurements, arguing, that, his, analysis, of, morton, was, influenced, by, his, opposition, to, racism, the, group, s, paper, was, reviewed, in, an, editorial, in, the, journal, nature, which, pointed, out, that, the, paper, s, authors, might, have, been, influenced, by, their, own, motivations, recommending, a, degree, of, caution, stating, the, critique, leaves, the, majority, of, gould, s, work, unscathed, and, noted, that, because, they, couldn, t, measure, all, the, skulls, they, do, not, know, whether, the, average, cranial, capacities, that, morton, reported, represent, his, sample, accurately, the, journal, stated, that, gould, s, opposition, to, racism, may, have, biased, his, interpretation, of, morton, s, data, but, also, noted, that, lewis, and, his, colleagues, have, their, own, motivations, several, in, the, group, have, an, association, with, the, university, of, pennsylvania, to, whom, morton, donated, his, collection, of, skulls, and, have, an, interest, in, seeing, the, valuable, but, understudied, skull, collection, freed, from, the, stigma, of, bias, and, did, not, accept, gould, s, theory, that, the, scientific, method, is, inevitably, tainted, by, bias, in, 2014, the, group, s, paper, was, critically, reviewed, in, the, journal, evolution, development, by, university, of, pennsylvania, philosopher, professor, michael, weisberg, who, tended, to, support, gould, s, original, accusations, concluding, that, there, is, prima, facie, evidence, of, a, racial, bias, in, morton, s, measurements, weisberg, concludes, that, although, gould, did, make, several, errors, and, overstated, his, case, in, a, number, of, places, morton, s, work, remains, a, cautionary, example, of, racial, bias, in, the, science, of, human, differences, in, 2015, biologists, and, philosophers, jonathan, kaplan, massimo, pigliucci, and, joshua, banta, published, an, article, arguing, that, no, meaningful, conclusions, could, be, drawn, from, morton, s, data, they, agreed, with, gould, and, disagreed, with, the, 2011, study, insofar, as, morton, s, study, was, seriously, flawed, but, they, agreed, with, the, 2011, study, insofar, as, gould, s, analysis, was, in, many, ways, not, better, than, morton, s, university, of, pennsylvania, anthropology, doctoral, student, paul, wolff, mitchell, published, an, analysis, of, morton, s, original, unpublished, data, which, neither, gould, nor, subsequent, commentators, had, directly, addressed, mitchell, concluded, that, gould, s, specific, argument, about, morton, s, unconscious, bias, in, measurement, is, not, supported, but, that, it, was, true, as, gould, had, claimed, that, morton, s, racial, biases, influenced, how, he, reported, and, interpreted, his, measurements, arguing, that, morton, s, interpretation, of, his, data, was, arbitrary, and, tendentious, morton, investigated, averages, and, ignored, variations, in, skull, size, so, large, that, there, was, significant, overlap, a, contemporary, of, morton, friedrich, tiedemann, had, collected, almost, identical, skull, data, and, drawn, conclusions, opposite, to, morton, s, on, the, basis, of, this, overlap, arguing, strongly, against, any, conception, of, a, racial, hierarchy, in, his, book, rocks, of, ages, 1999, gould, put, forward, what, he, described, as, a, blessedly, simple, and, entirely, conventional, resolution, to, the, supposed, conflict, between, science, and, religion, he, defines, the, term, magisterium, as, a, domain, where, one, form, of, teaching, holds, the, appropriate, tools, for, meaningful, discourse, and, resolution, the, non, overlapping, magisteria, noma, principle, therefore, divides, the, magisterium, of, science, to, cover, the, empirical, realm, what, the, universe, is, made, of, fact, and, why, does, it, work, in, this, way, theory, the, magisterium, of, religion, extends, over, questions, of, ultimate, meaning, and, moral, value, these, two, magisteria, do, not, overlap, nor, do, they, encompass, all, inquiry, he, suggests, that, noma, enjoys, strong, and, fully, explicit, support, even, from, the, primary, cultural, stereotypes, of, hard, line, traditionalism, and, that, noma, is, a, sound, position, of, general, consensus, established, by, long, struggle, among, people, of, goodwill, in, both, magisteria, this, view, has, not, been, without, criticism, however, in, his, book, the, god, delusion, richard, dawkins, argues, that, the, division, between, religion, and, science, is, not, so, simple, as, gould, claims, as, few, religions, exist, without, claiming, the, existence, of, miracles, which, by, definition, violate, the, principles, of, science, dawkins, also, opposes, the, idea, that, religion, has, anything, meaningful, to, say, about, ethics, and, values, and, therefore, has, no, authority, to, claim, a, magisterium, of, its, own, he, goes, on, to, say, that, he, believes, gould, is, bending, over, backwards, to, be, nice, to, an, unworthy, but, powerful, opponent, similarly, humanist, philosopher, paul, kurtz, argues, that, gould, was, wrong, to, posit, that, science, has, nothing, to, say, about, questions, of, ethics, in, fact, kurtz, claims, that, science, is, a, much, better, method, than, religion, for, determining, moral, principles, gould, s, publications, were, numerous, one, review, of, his, publications, between, 1965, and, 2000, noted, 479, peer, reviewed, papers, 22, books, 300, essays, and, 101, major, book, reviews, the, following, is, a, list, of, books, either, written, or, edited, by, stephen, jay, gould, including, those, published, after, his, death, in, 2002, while, some, books, have, been, republished, at, later, dates, by, multiple, publishers, the, list, below, comprises, the, original, publisher, and, publishing, date
