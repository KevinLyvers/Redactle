sir, alexander, fleming, frs, frse, frcs, 6, august, 1881, 11, march, 1955, was, a, scottish, physician, and, microbiologist, best, known, for, discovering, the, world, s, first, broadly, effective, antibiotic, substance, which, he, named, penicillin, his, discovery, in, 1928, of, what, was, later, named, benzylpenicillin, or, penicillin, g, from, the, mould, penicillium, rubens, has, been, described, as, the, single, greatest, victory, ever, achieved, over, disease, for, this, discovery, he, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1945, with, howard, florey, and, ernst, boris, chain, he, also, discovered, the, enzyme, lysozyme, from, his, nasal, discharge, in, 1922, and, along, with, it, a, bacterium, he, named, micrococcus, lysodeikticus, later, renamed, micrococcus, luteus, fleming, was, knighted, for, his, scientific, achievements, in, 1944, in, 1999, he, was, named, in, time, magazine, s, list, of, the, 100, most, important, people, of, the, 20th, century, in, 2002, he, was, chosen, in, the, bbc, s, television, poll, for, determining, the, 100, greatest, britons, and, in, 2009, he, was, also, voted, third, greatest, scot, in, an, opinion, poll, conducted, by, stv, behind, only, robert, burns, and, william, wallace, born, on, 6, august, 1881, at, lochfield, farm, near, darvel, in, ayrshire, scotland, alexander, fleming, was, the, third, of, four, children, of, farmer, hugh, fleming, and, grace, stirling, morton, the, daughter, of, a, neighbouring, farmer, hugh, fleming, had, four, surviving, children, from, his, first, marriage, he, was, 59, at, the, time, of, his, second, marriage, to, grace, and, died, when, alexander, was, seven, fleming, went, to, loudoun, moor, school, and, darvel, school, and, earned, a, two, year, scholarship, to, kilmarnock, academy, before, moving, to, london, where, he, attended, the, royal, polytechnic, institution, after, working, in, a, shipping, office, for, four, years, the, twenty, year, old, alexander, fleming, inherited, some, money, from, an, uncle, john, fleming, his, elder, brother, tom, was, already, a, physician, and, suggested, to, him, that, he, should, follow, the, same, career, and, so, in, 1903, the, younger, alexander, enrolled, at, st, mary, s, hospital, medical, school, in, paddington, now, part, of, imperial, college, london, he, qualified, with, an, mbbs, degree, from, the, school, with, distinction, in, 1906, fleming, who, was, a, private, in, the, london, scottish, regiment, of, the, volunteer, force, from, 1900, to, 1914, had, been, a, member, of, the, rifle, club, at, the, medical, school, the, captain, of, the, club, wishing, to, retain, fleming, in, the, team, suggested, that, he, join, the, research, department, at, st, mary, s, where, he, became, assistant, bacteriologist, to, sir, almroth, wright, a, pioneer, in, vaccine, therapy, and, immunology, in, 1908, he, gained, a, bsc, degree, with, gold, medal, in, bacteriology, and, became, a, lecturer, at, st, mary, s, until, 1914, commissioned, lieutenant, in, 1914, and, promoted, captain, in, 1917, fleming, served, throughout, world, war, i, in, the, royal, army, medical, corps, and, was, mentioned, in, dispatches, he, and, many, of, his, colleagues, worked, in, battlefield, hospitals, at, the, western, front, in, france, in, 1918, he, returned, to, st, mary, s, hospital, where, he, was, elected, professor, of, bacteriology, of, the, university, of, london, in, 1928, in, 1951, he, was, elected, the, rector, of, the, university, of, edinburgh, for, a, term, of, three, years, during, world, war, i, fleming, with, leonard, colebrook, and, sir, almroth, wright, joined, the, war, efforts, and, practically, moved, the, entire, inoculation, department, of, st, mary, s, to, the, british, military, hospital, at, boulogne, sur, mer, serving, as, a, temporary, lieutenant, of, the, royal, army, medical, corps, he, witnessed, the, death, of, many, soldiers, from, sepsis, resulting, from, infected, wounds, antiseptics, which, were, used, at, the, time, to, treat, infected, wounds, he, observed, often, worsened, the, injuries, in, an, article, published, in, the, medical, journal, the, lancet, in, 1917, he, described, an, ingenious, experiment, which, he, was, able, to, conduct, as, a, result, of, his, own, glassblowing, skills, in, which, he, explained, why, antiseptics, were, killing, more, soldiers, than, infection, itself, during, the, war, antiseptics, worked, well, on, the, surface, but, deep, wounds, tended, to, shelter, anaerobic, bacteria, from, the, antiseptic, agent, and, antiseptics, seemed, to, remove, beneficial, agents, produced, that, protected, the, patients, in, these, cases, at, least, as, well, as, they, removed, bacteria, and, did, nothing, to, remove, the, bacteria, that, were, out, of, reach, wright, strongly, supported, fleming, s, findings, but, despite, this, most, army, physicians, over, the, course, of, the, war, continued, to, use, antiseptics, even, in, cases, where, this, worsened, the, condition, of, the, patients, at, st, mary, s, hospital, fleming, continued, his, investigations, into, bacteria, culture, and, antibacterial, substances, as, his, research, scholar, at, the, time, v, d, allison, recalled, fleming, was, not, a, tidy, researcher, and, usually, expected, unusual, bacterial, growths, in, his, culture, plates, fleming, had, teased, allison, of, his, excessive, tidiness, in, the, laboratory, and, allison, rightly, attributed, such, untidiness, as, the, success, of, fleming, s, experiments, and, said, he, had, been, as, tidy, as, he, thought, i, was, he, would, not, have, made, his, two, great, discoveries, in, late, 1921, while, he, was, maintaining, agar, plates, for, bacteria, he, found, that, one, of, the, plates, was, contaminated, with, bacteria, from, the, air, when, he, added, nasal, mucus, he, found, that, the, mucus, inhibited, the, bacterial, growth, surrounding, the, mucus, area, was, a, clear, transparent, circle, 1, cm, from, the, mucus, indicating, the, killing, zone, of, bacteria, followed, by, a, glassy, and, translucent, ring, beyond, which, was, an, opaque, area, indicating, normal, bacterial, growth, in, the, next, test, he, used, bacteria, maintained, in, saline, that, formed, a, yellow, suspension, within, two, minutes, of, adding, fresh, mucus, the, yellow, saline, turned, completely, clear, he, extended, his, tests, using, tears, which, were, contributed, by, his, co, workers, as, allison, reminisced, saying, for, the, next, five, or, six, weeks, our, tears, were, the, source, of, supply, for, this, extraordinary, phenomenon, many, were, the, lemons, we, used, after, the, failure, of, onions, to, produce, a, flow, of, tears, the, demand, by, us, for, tears, was, so, great, that, laboratory, attendants, were, pressed, into, service, receiving, threepence, for, each, contribution, his, further, tests, with, sputum, cartilage, blood, semen, ovarian, cyst, fluid, pus, and, egg, white, showed, that, the, bactericidal, agent, was, present, in, all, of, these, he, reported, his, discovery, before, the, medical, research, club, in, december, and, before, the, royal, society, the, next, year, but, failed, to, stir, any, interest, as, allison, recollected, i, was, present, at, this, meeting, as, fleming, s, guest, his, paper, describing, his, discovery, was, received, with, no, questions, asked, and, no, discussion, which, was, most, unusual, and, an, indication, that, it, was, considered, to, be, of, no, importance, the, following, year, he, read, a, paper, on, the, subject, before, the, royal, society, burlington, house, piccadilly, and, he, and, i, gave, a, demonstration, of, our, work, again, with, one, exception, little, comment, or, attention, was, paid, to, it, reporting, in, the, 1, may, 1922, issue, of, the, proceedings, of, the, royal, society, b, biological, sciences, under, the, title, on, a, remarkable, bacteriolytic, element, found, in, tissues, and, secretions, fleming, wrote, in, this, communication, i, wish, to, draw, attention, to, a, substance, present, in, the, tissues, and, secretions, of, the, body, which, is, capable, of, rapidly, dissolving, certain, bacteria, as, this, substance, has, properties, akin, to, those, of, ferments, i, have, called, it, a, lysozyme, and, shall, refer, to, it, by, this, name, throughout, the, communication, the, lysozyme, was, first, noticed, during, some, investigations, made, on, a, patient, suffering, from, acute, coryza, this, was, the, first, recorded, discovery, of, lysozyme, with, allison, he, published, further, studies, on, lysozyme, in, october, issue, of, the, british, journal, of, experimental, pathology, the, same, year, although, he, was, able, to, obtain, larger, amounts, of, lysozyme, from, egg, whites, the, enzyme, was, only, effective, against, small, counts, of, harmless, bacteria, and, therefore, had, little, therapeutic, potential, this, indicates, one, of, the, major, differences, between, pathogenic, and, harmless, bacteria, described, in, the, original, publication, a, patient, suffering, from, acute, coryza, was, later, identified, as, fleming, himself, his, research, notebook, dated, 21, november, 1921, showed, a, sketch, of, the, culture, plate, with, a, small, note, staphyloid, coccus, from, a, f, s, nose, he, also, identified, the, bacterium, present, in, the, nasal, mucus, as, micrococcus, lysodeikticus, giving, the, species, name, meaning, lysis, indicator, for, its, susceptibility, to, lysozymal, activity, the, species, was, reassigned, as, micrococcus, luteus, in, 1972, the, fleming, strain, nctc2665, of, this, bacterium, has, become, a, model, in, different, biological, studies, the, importance, of, lysozyme, was, not, recognised, and, fleming, was, well, aware, of, this, in, his, presidential, address, at, the, royal, society, of, medicine, meeting, on, 18, october, 1932, he, said, i, choose, lysozyme, as, the, subject, for, this, address, for, two, reasons, firstly, because, i, have, a, fatherly, interest, in, the, name, and, secondly, because, its, importance, in, connection, with, natural, immunity, does, not, seem, to, be, generally, appreciated, in, his, nobel, lecture, on, 11, december, 1945, he, briefly, mentioned, lysozyme, saying, penicillin, was, not, the, first, antibiotic, i, happened, to, discover, it, was, only, towards, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, that, the, true, importance, of, fleming, s, discovery, in, immunology, was, realised, as, lysozyme, became, the, first, antimicrobial, protein, discovered, that, constitute, part, of, our, innate, immunity, one, sometimes, finds, what, one, is, not, looking, for, when, i, woke, up, just, after, dawn, on, september, 28, 1928, i, certainly, didn, t, plan, to, revolutionize, all, medicine, by, discovering, the, world, s, first, antibiotic, or, bacteria, killer, but, i, suppose, that, was, exactly, what, i, did, by, 1927, fleming, had, been, investigating, the, properties, of, staphylococci, he, was, already, well, known, from, his, earlier, work, and, had, developed, a, reputation, as, a, brilliant, researcher, in, 1928, he, studied, the, variation, of, staphylococcus, aureus, grown, under, natural, condition, after, the, work, of, joseph, warwick, bigger, who, discovered, that, the, bacterium, could, grow, into, a, variety, of, types, strains, on, 3, september, 1928, fleming, returned, to, his, laboratory, having, spent, a, holiday, with, his, family, at, suffolk, before, leaving, for, his, holiday, he, inoculated, staphylococci, on, culture, plates, and, left, them, on, a, bench, in, a, corner, of, his, laboratory, on, his, return, fleming, noticed, that, one, culture, was, contaminated, with, a, fungus, and, that, the, colonies, of, staphylococci, immediately, surrounding, the, fungus, had, been, destroyed, whereas, other, staphylococci, colonies, farther, away, were, normal, famously, remarking, that, s, funny, fleming, showed, the, contaminated, culture, to, his, former, assistant, merlin, pryce, who, reminded, him, that, s, how, you, discovered, lysozyme, he, identified, the, mould, as, being, from, the, genus, penicillium, he, suspected, it, to, be, p, chrysogenum, but, a, colleague, charles, j, la, touche, identified, it, as, p, rubrum, it, was, later, corrected, as, p, notatum, and, then, officially, accepted, as, p, chrysogenum, in, 2011, it, was, resolved, as, p, rubens, the, laboratory, in, which, fleming, discovered, and, tested, penicillin, is, preserved, as, the, alexander, fleming, laboratory, museum, in, st, mary, s, hospital, paddington, the, source, of, the, fungal, contaminant, was, established, in, 1966, as, coming, from, la, touche, s, room, which, was, directly, below, fleming, s, fleming, grew, the, mould, in, a, pure, culture, and, found, that, the, culture, broth, contained, an, antibacterial, substance, he, investigated, its, anti, bacterial, effect, on, many, organisms, and, noticed, that, it, affected, bacteria, such, as, staphylococci, and, many, other, gram, positive, pathogens, that, cause, scarlet, fever, pneumonia, meningitis, and, diphtheria, but, not, typhoid, fever, or, paratyphoid, fever, which, are, caused, by, gram, negative, bacteria, for, which, he, was, seeking, a, cure, at, the, time, it, also, affected, neisseria, gonorrhoeae, which, causes, gonorrhoea, although, this, bacterium, is, gram, negative, after, some, months, of, calling, it, mould, juice, or, the, inhibitor, he, gave, the, name, penicillin, on, 7, march, 1929, for, the, antibacterial, substance, present, in, the, mould, fleming, presented, his, discovery, on, 13, february, 1929, before, the, medical, research, club, his, talk, on, a, medium, for, the, isolation, of, pfeiffer, s, bacillus, did, not, receive, any, particular, attention, or, comment, henry, dale, the, then, director, of, national, institute, for, medical, research, and, chair, of, the, meeting, much, later, reminisced, that, he, did, not, even, sense, any, striking, point, of, importance, in, fleming, s, speech, fleming, published, his, discovery, in, 1929, in, the, british, journal, of, experimental, pathology, but, little, attention, was, paid, to, the, article, his, problem, was, the, difficulty, of, producing, penicillin, in, large, amounts, and, moreover, isolation, of, the, main, compound, even, with, the, help, of, harold, raistrick, and, his, team, of, biochemists, at, the, london, school, of, hygiene, tropical, medicine, chemical, purification, was, futile, as, a, result, penicillin, languished, largely, forgotten, in, the, 1930s, as, milton, wainwright, described, as, late, as, in, 1936, there, was, no, appreciation, for, penicillin, when, fleming, talked, of, its, medical, importance, at, the, second, international, congress, of, microbiology, held, in, london, no, one, believed, him, as, allison, his, companion, in, both, the, medical, research, club, and, international, congress, meeting, remarked, the, two, occasions, suggested, the, possible, value, of, penicillin, for, the, treatment, of, infection, in, man, again, there, was, a, total, lack, of, interest, and, no, discussion, fleming, was, keenly, disappointed, but, worse, was, to, follow, he, read, a, paper, on, his, work, on, penicillin, at, a, meeting, of, the, international, congress, of, microbiology, attended, by, the, foremost, bacteriologists, from, all, over, the, world, there, was, no, support, for, his, views, on, its, possible, future, value, for, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, human, infections, and, discussion, was, minimal, fleming, bore, these, disappointments, stoically, but, they, did, not, alter, his, views, or, deter, him, from, continuing, his, investigation, of, penicillin, in, 1941, the, british, medical, journal, reported, that, does, not, appear, to, have, been, considered, as, possibly, useful, from, any, other, point, of, view, in, oxford, ernst, boris, chain, and, edward, abraham, were, studying, the, molecular, structure, of, the, antibiotic, abraham, was, the, first, to, propose, the, correct, structure, of, penicillin, shortly, after, the, team, published, its, first, results, in, 1940, fleming, telephoned, howard, florey, chain, s, head, of, department, to, say, that, he, would, be, visiting, within, the, next, few, days, when, chain, heard, that, fleming, was, coming, he, remarked, good, god, i, thought, he, was, dead, norman, heatley, suggested, transferring, the, active, ingredient, of, penicillin, back, into, water, by, changing, its, acidity, this, produced, enough, of, the, drug, to, begin, testing, on, animals, there, were, many, more, people, involved, in, the, oxford, team, and, at, one, point, the, entire, sir, william, dunn, school, of, pathology, was, involved, in, its, production, after, the, team, had, developed, a, method, of, purifying, penicillin, to, an, effective, first, stable, form, in, 1940, several, clinical, trials, ensued, and, their, amazing, success, inspired, the, team, to, develop, methods, for, mass, production, and, mass, distribution, in, 1945, fleming, was, modest, about, his, part, in, the, development, of, penicillin, describing, his, fame, as, the, fleming, myth, and, he, praised, florey, and, chain, for, transforming, the, laboratory, curiosity, into, a, practical, drug, fleming, was, the, first, to, discover, the, properties, of, the, active, substance, giving, him, the, privilege, of, naming, it, penicillin, he, also, kept, grew, and, distributed, the, original, mould, for, twelve, years, and, continued, until, 1940, to, try, to, get, help, from, any, chemist, who, had, enough, skill, to, make, penicillin, sir, henry, harris, summed, up, the, process, in, 1998, as, without, fleming, no, chain, without, chain, no, florey, without, florey, no, heatley, without, heatley, no, penicillin, the, discovery, of, penicillin, and, its, subsequent, development, as, a, prescription, drug, mark, the, start, of, modern, antibiotics, in, his, first, clinical, trial, fleming, treated, his, research, scholar, stuart, craddock, who, had, developed, severe, infection, of, the, nasal, antrum, sinusitis, the, treatment, started, on, 9, january, 1929, but, without, any, effect, it, probably, was, due, to, the, fact, that, the, infection, was, with, influenza, bacillus, haemophilus, influenzae, the, bacterium, which, he, had, found, unsusceptible, to, penicillin, fleming, gave, some, of, his, original, penicillin, samples, to, his, colleague, surgeon, arthur, dickson, wright, for, clinical, test, in, 1928, although, wright, reportedly, said, that, it, seemed, to, work, satisfactorily, there, are, no, records, of, its, specific, use, cecil, george, paine, a, pathologist, at, the, royal, infirmary, in, sheffield, and, former, student, of, fleming, was, the, first, to, use, penicillin, successfully, for, medical, treatment, he, cured, eye, infections, conjunctivitis, of, one, adult, and, three, infants, neonatal, conjunctivitis, on, 25, november, 1930, fleming, also, successfully, treated, severe, conjunctivitis, in, 1932, keith, bernard, rogers, who, had, joined, st, mary, s, as, medical, student, in, 1929, was, captain, of, the, london, university, rifle, team, and, was, about, to, participate, in, an, inter, hospital, rifle, shooting, competition, when, he, developed, conjunctivitis, fleming, applied, his, penicillin, and, cured, rogers, before, the, competition, it, is, said, that, the, penicillin, worked, and, the, match, was, won, however, the, report, that, keith, was, probably, the, first, patient, to, be, treated, clinically, with, penicillin, ointment, is, no, longer, true, as, paine, s, medical, records, showed, up, there, is, a, popular, assertion, both, in, popular, and, scientific, literature, that, fleming, largely, abandoned, penicillin, work, in, the, early, 1930s, in, his, review, of, andr, maurois, s, the, life, of, sir, alexander, fleming, discoverer, of, penicillin, william, l, kissick, went, so, far, as, to, say, that, fleming, had, abandoned, penicillin, in, 1932, although, the, recipient, of, many, honors, and, the, author, of, much, scientific, work, sir, alexander, fleming, does, not, appear, to, be, an, ideal, subject, for, a, biography, this, is, false, as, fleming, continued, to, pursue, penicillin, research, as, late, as, in, 1939, fleming, s, notebook, shows, attempts, to, make, better, penicillin, production, using, different, media, in, 1941, he, published, a, method, for, assessment, of, penicillin, effectiveness, as, to, the, chemical, isolation, and, purification, howard, florey, and, ernst, boris, chain, at, the, radcliffe, infirmary, in, oxford, took, up, the, research, to, mass, produce, it, which, they, achieved, with, support, from, world, war, ii, military, projects, under, the, british, and, us, governments, by, mid, 1942, the, oxford, team, produced, the, pure, penicillin, compound, as, yellow, powder, in, august, 1942, harry, lambert, an, associate, of, fleming, s, brother, robert, was, admitted, to, st, mary, s, hospital, due, to, a, life, threatening, infection, of, the, nervous, system, streptococcal, meningitis, fleming, treated, him, with, sulphonamides, but, lambert, s, condition, deteriorated, he, tested, the, antibiotic, susceptibility, and, found, that, his, penicillin, could, kill, the, bacteria, he, requested, florey, for, the, isolated, sample, florey, sent, the, incompletely, purified, sample, which, fleming, immediately, administered, into, lambert, s, spinal, canal, lambert, showed, signs, of, improvement, the, very, next, day, and, completely, recovered, within, a, week, fleming, published, the, clinical, case, in, the, lancet, in, 1943, upon, this, medical, breakthrough, allison, informed, the, british, ministry, of, health, of, the, importance, of, penicillin, and, the, need, for, mass, production, the, war, cabinet, was, convinced, of, the, usefulness, upon, which, sir, cecil, weir, director, general, of, equipment, called, for, a, meeting, on, the, mode, of, action, on, 28, september, 1942, the, penicillin, committee, was, created, on, 5, april, 1943, the, committee, consisted, of, weir, as, chairman, fleming, florey, sir, percival, hartley, allison, and, representatives, from, pharmaceutical, companies, as, members, the, main, goals, were, to, produce, penicillin, rapidly, in, large, quantities, with, collaboration, of, american, companies, and, to, supply, the, drug, exclusively, for, allied, armed, forces, by, d, day, in, 1944, enough, penicillin, had, been, produced, to, treat, all, the, wounded, of, the, allied, troops, fleming, also, discovered, very, early, that, bacteria, developed, antibiotic, resistance, whenever, too, little, penicillin, was, used, or, when, it, was, used, for, too, short, a, period, almroth, wright, had, predicted, antibiotic, resistance, even, before, it, was, noticed, during, experiments, fleming, cautioned, about, the, use, of, penicillin, in, his, many, speeches, around, the, world, on, 26, june, 1945, he, made, the, following, cautionary, statements, the, microbes, are, educated, to, resist, penicillin, and, a, host, of, penicillin, fast, organisms, is, bred, out, in, such, cases, the, thoughtless, person, playing, with, penicillin, is, morally, responsible, for, the, death, of, the, man, who, finally, succumbs, to, infection, with, the, penicillin, resistant, organism, i, hope, this, evil, can, be, averted, he, cautioned, not, to, use, penicillin, unless, there, was, a, properly, diagnosed, reason, for, it, to, be, used, and, that, if, it, were, used, never, to, use, too, little, or, for, too, short, a, period, since, these, are, the, circumstances, under, which, bacterial, resistance, to, antibiotics, develops, it, had, been, experimentally, shown, in, 1942, that, s, aureu, s, could, develop, penicillin, resistance, under, prolonged, exposure, elaborating, the, possibility, of, penicillin, resistance, in, clinical, conditions, in, his, nobel, lecture, fleming, said, the, time, may, come, when, penicillin, can, be, bought, by, anyone, in, the, shops, then, there, is, the, danger, that, the, ignorant, man, may, easily, underdose, himself, and, by, exposing, his, microbes, to, non, lethal, quantities, of, the, drug, make, them, resistant, it, was, around, that, time, that, the, first, clinical, case, of, penicillin, resistance, was, reported, on, 24, december, 1915, fleming, married, a, trained, nurse, sarah, marion, mcelroy, of, killala, county, mayo, ireland, their, only, child, robert, fleming, 1924, 2015, became, a, general, medical, practitioner, after, his, first, wife, s, death, in, 1949, fleming, married, amalia, koutsouri, vourekas, a, greek, colleague, at, st, mary, s, on, 9, april, 1953, she, died, in, 1986, fleming, came, from, a, presbyterian, background, while, his, first, wife, sarah, was, a, lapsed, roman, catholic, it, is, said, that, he, was, not, particularly, religious, and, their, son, robert, was, later, received, into, the, anglican, church, while, still, reportedly, inheriting,

ingredient, in, that, mould, which, fleming, named, penicillin, turned, out, to, be, an, infection, fighting, agent, of, enormous, potency, when, it, was, finally, recognized, for, what, it, was, the, most, efficacious, life, saving, drug, in, the, world, penicillin, would, alter, forever, the, treatment, of, bacterial, infections, by, the, middle, of, the, century, fleming, s, discovery, had,

story, of, winston, churchill, s, father, paying, for, fleming, s, education, after, fleming, s, father, saved, young, winston, from, death, is, false, according, to, the, biography, penicillin, man,
