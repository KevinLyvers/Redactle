dmitri, ivanovich, mendeleev, formemrs, sometimes, romanized, as, mendeleyev, mendeleiev, or, mendeleef, english, m, n, d, l, e, f, men, d, l, ay, f, russian, romanized, dmitriy, ivanovich, mendeleyev, ipa, 8, february, 1834, 2, february, 1907, was, a, russian, chemist, and, inventor, he, is, best, known, for, formulating, the, periodic, law, and, creating, a, version, of, the, periodic, table, of, elements, he, used, the, periodic, law, not, only, to, correct, the, then, accepted, properties, of, some, known, elements, such, as, the, valence, and, atomic, weight, of, uranium, but, also, to, predict, the, properties, of, three, elements, that, were, yet, to, be, discovered, germanium, gallium, and, scandium, mendeleev, was, born, in, the, village, of, verkhnie, aremzyani, near, tobolsk, in, siberia, to, ivan, pavlovich, mendeleev, 1783, 1847, and, maria, dmitrievna, mendeleeva, n, e, kornilieva, 1793, 1850, ivan, worked, as, a, school, principal, and, a, teacher, of, fine, arts, politics, and, philosophy, at, the, tambov, and, saratov, gymnasiums, ivan, s, father, pavel, maximovich, sokolov, was, a, russian, orthodox, priest, from, the, tver, region, as, per, the, tradition, of, priests, of, that, time, pavel, s, children, were, given, new, family, names, while, attending, the, theological, seminary, with, ivan, getting, the, family, name, mendeleev, after, the, name, of, a, local, landlord, maria, kornilieva, came, from, a, well, known, family, of, tobolsk, merchants, founders, of, the, first, siberian, printing, house, who, traced, their, ancestry, to, yakov, korniliev, a, 17th, century, posad, man, turned, a, wealthy, merchant, in, 1889, a, local, librarian, published, an, article, in, the, tobolsk, newspaper, where, he, claimed, that, yakov, was, a, baptized, teleut, an, ethnic, minority, known, as, white, kalmyks, at, the, time, since, no, sources, were, provided, and, no, documented, facts, of, yakov, s, life, were, ever, revealed, biographers, generally, dismiss, it, as, a, myth, in, 1908, shortly, after, mendeleev, s, death, one, of, his, nieces, published, family, chronicles, memories, about, d, i, mendeleev, where, she, voiced, a, family, legend, about, maria, s, grandfather, who, married, a, kyrgyz, or, tatar, beauty, whom, he, loved, so, much, that, when, she, died, he, also, died, from, grief, this, however, contradicts, the, documented, family, chronicles, and, neither, of, those, legends, is, supported, by, mendeleev, s, autobiography, his, daughter, s, or, his, wife, s, memoirs, yet, some, western, scholars, still, refer, to, mendeleev, s, supposed, mongol, tatar, tartarian, or, simply, asian, ancestry, as, a, fact, mendeleev, was, raised, as, an, orthodox, christian, his, mother, encouraging, him, to, patiently, search, divine, and, scientific, truth, his, son, ivan, would, later, inform, that, mendeleev, had, departed, from, the, church, and, embraced, a, form, of, romanticized, deism, mendeleev, was, the, youngest, of, 17, siblings, of, whom, only, 14, stayed, alive, to, be, baptized, according, to, mendeleev, s, brother, pavel, meaning, the, others, died, soon, after, their, birth, the, exact, number, of, mendeleev, s, siblings, differs, among, sources, and, is, still, a, matter, of, some, historical, dispute, unfortunately, for, the, family, s, financial, well, being, his, father, became, blind, and, lost, his, teaching, position, his, mother, was, forced, to, work, and, she, restarted, her, family, s, abandoned, glass, factory, at, the, age, of, 13, after, the, passing, of, his, father, and, the, destruction, of, his, mother, s, factory, by, fire, mendeleev, attended, the, gymnasium, in, tobolsk, in, 1849, his, mother, took, mendeleev, across, russia, from, siberia, to, moscow, with, the, aim, of, getting, mendeleev, enrolled, at, the, moscow, university, the, university, in, moscow, did, not, accept, him, the, mother, and, son, continued, to, saint, petersburg, to, the, father, s, alma, mater, the, now, poor, mendeleev, family, relocated, to, saint, petersburg, where, he, entered, the, main, pedagogical, institute, in, 1850, after, graduation, he, contracted, tuberculosis, causing, him, to, move, to, the, crimean, peninsula, on, the, northern, coast, of, the, black, sea, in, 1855, while, there, he, became, a, science, master, of, the, 1st, simferopol, gymnasium, in, 1857, he, returned, to, saint, petersburg, with, fully, restored, health, between, 1859, and, 1861, he, worked, on, the, capillarity, of, liquids, and, the, workings, of, the, spectroscope, in, heidelberg, later, in, 1861, he, published, a, textbook, named, organic, chemistry, this, won, him, the, demidov, prize, of, the, petersburg, academy, of, sciences, on, 4, april, 1862, he, became, engaged, to, feozva, nikitichna, leshcheva, and, they, married, on, 27, april, 1862, at, nikolaev, engineering, institute, s, church, in, saint, petersburg, where, he, taught, mendeleev, became, a, professor, at, the, saint, petersburg, technological, institute, and, saint, petersburg, state, university, in, 1864, and, 1865, respectively, in, 1865, he, became, a, doctor, of, science, for, his, dissertation, on, the, combinations, of, water, with, alcohol, he, achieved, tenure, in, 1867, at, st, petersburg, university, and, started, to, teach, inorganic, chemistry, while, succeeding, voskresenskii, to, this, post, by, 1871, he, had, transformed, saint, petersburg, into, an, internationally, recognized, center, for, chemistry, research, in, 1863, there, were, 56, known, elements, with, a, new, element, being, discovered, at, a, rate, of, approximately, one, per, year, other, scientists, had, previously, identified, periodicity, of, elements, john, newlands, described, a, law, of, octaves, noting, their, periodicity, according, to, relative, atomic, weight, in, 1864, publishing, it, in, 1865, his, proposal, identified, the, potential, for, new, elements, such, as, germanium, the, concept, was, criticized, and, his, innovation, was, not, recognized, by, the, society, of, chemists, until, 1887, another, person, to, propose, a, periodic, table, was, lothar, meyer, who, published, a, paper, in, 1864, describing, 28, elements, classified, by, their, valence, but, with, no, predictions, of, new, elements, after, becoming, a, teacher, in, 1867, mendeleev, wrote, principles, of, chemistry, russian, romanized, osnovy, khimii, which, became, the, definitive, textbook, of, its, time, it, was, published, in, two, volumes, between, 1868, and, 1870, and, mendeleev, wrote, it, as, he, was, preparing, a, textbook, for, his, course, this, is, when, he, made, his, most, important, discovery, as, he, attempted, to, classify, the, elements, according, to, their, chemical, properties, he, noticed, patterns, that, led, him, to, postulate, his, periodic, table, he, claimed, to, have, envisioned, the, complete, arrangement, of, the, elements, in, a, dream, i, saw, in, a, dream, a, table, where, all, elements, fell, into, place, as, required, awakening, i, immediately, wrote, it, down, on, a, piece, of, paper, only, in, one, place, did, a, correction, later, seem, necessary, unaware, of, the, earlier, work, on, periodic, tables, going, on, in, the, 1860s, he, made, the, following, table, by, adding, additional, elements, following, this, pattern, mendeleev, developed, his, extended, version, of, the, periodic, table, on, 6, march, 1869, he, made, a, formal, presentation, to, the, russian, chemical, society, titled, the, dependence, between, the, properties, of, the, atomic, weights, of, the, elements, which, described, elements, according, to, both, atomic, weight, now, called, relative, atomic, mass, and, valence, this, presentation, stated, that, mendeleev, published, his, periodic, table, of, all, known, elements, and, predicted, several, new, elements, to, complete, the, table, in, a, russian, language, journal, only, a, few, months, after, meyer, published, a, virtually, identical, table, in, a, german, language, journal, mendeleev, has, the, distinction, of, accurately, predicting, the, properties, of, what, he, called, ekasilicon, ekaaluminium, and, ekaboron, germanium, gallium, and, scandium, respectively, mendeleev, also, proposed, changes, in, the, properties, of, some, known, elements, prior, to, his, work, uranium, was, supposed, to, have, valence, 3, and, atomic, weight, about, 120, mendeleev, realized, that, these, values, did, not, fit, in, his, periodic, table, and, doubled, both, to, valence, 6, and, atomic, weight, 240, close, to, the, modern, value, of, 238, for, his, predicted, three, elements, he, used, the, prefixes, of, eka, dvi, and, tri, sanskrit, one, two, three, in, their, naming, mendeleev, questioned, some, of, the, currently, accepted, atomic, weights, they, could, be, measured, only, with, a, relatively, low, accuracy, at, that, time, pointing, out, that, they, did, not, correspond, to, those, suggested, by, his, periodic, law, he, noted, that, tellurium, has, a, higher, atomic, weight, than, iodine, but, he, placed, them, in, the, right, order, incorrectly, predicting, that, the, accepted, atomic, weights, at, the, time, were, at, fault, he, was, puzzled, about, where, to, put, the, known, lanthanides, and, predicted, the, existence, of, another, row, to, the, table, which, were, the, actinides, which, were, some, of, the, heaviest, in, atomic, weight, some, people, dismissed, mendeleev, for, predicting, that, there, would, be, more, elements, but, he, was, proven, to, be, correct, when, ga, gallium, and, ge, germanium, were, found, in, 1875, and, 1886, respectively, fitting, perfectly, into, the, two, missing, spaces, by, using, sanskrit, prefixes, to, name, missing, elements, mendeleev, may, have, recorded, his, debt, to, the, sanskrit, grammarians, of, ancient, india, who, had, created, theories, of, language, based, on, their, discovery, of, the, two, dimensional, patterns, of, speech, sounds, exemplified, by, the, ivas, tras, in, p, ini, s, sanskrit, grammar, mendeleev, was, a, friend, and, colleague, of, the, sanskritist, otto, von, b, htlingk, who, was, preparing, the, second, edition, of, his, book, on, p, ini, at, about, this, time, and, mendeleev, wished, to, honor, p, ini, with, his, nomenclature, the, original, draft, made, by, mendeleev, would, be, found, years, later, and, published, under, the, name, tentative, system, of, elements, dmitri, mendeleev, is, often, referred, to, as, the, father, of, the, periodic, table, he, called, his, table, or, matrix, the, periodic, system, in, 1876, he, became, obsessed, with, anna, ivanova, popova, and, began, courting, her, in, 1881, he, proposed, to, her, and, threatened, suicide, if, she, refused, his, divorce, from, leshcheva, was, finalized, one, month, after, he, had, married, popova, on, 2, april, in, early, 1882, even, after, the, divorce, mendeleev, was, technically, a, bigamist, the, russian, orthodox, church, required, at, least, seven, years, before, lawful, remarriage, his, divorce, and, the, surrounding, controversy, contributed, to, his, failure, to, be, admitted, to, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, despite, his, international, fame, by, that, time, his, daughter, from, his, second, marriage, lyubov, became, the, wife, of, the, famous, russian, poet, alexander, blok, his, other, children, were, son, vladimir, a, sailor, he, took, part, in, the, notable, eastern, journey, of, nicholas, ii, and, daughter, olga, from, his, first, marriage, to, feozva, and, son, ivan, and, twins, from, anna, though, mendeleev, was, widely, honored, by, scientific, organizations, all, over, europe, including, in, 1882, the, davy, medal, from, the, royal, society, of, london, which, later, also, awarded, him, the, copley, medal, in, 1905, he, resigned, from, saint, petersburg, university, on, 17, august, 1890, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1892, and, in, 1893, he, was, appointed, director, of, the, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, a, post, which, he, occupied, until, his, death, mendeleev, also, investigated, the, composition, of, petroleum, and, helped, to, found, the, first, oil, refinery, in, russia, he, recognized, the, importance, of, petroleum, as, a, feedstock, for, petrochemicals, he, is, credited, with, a, remark, that, burning, petroleum, as, a, fuel, would, be, akin, to, firing, up, a, kitchen, stove, with, bank, notes, in, 1905, mendeleev, was, elected, a, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, the, following, year, the, nobel, committee, for, chemistry, recommended, to, the, swedish, academy, to, award, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, 1906, to, mendeleev, for, his, discovery, of, the, periodic, system, he, was, also, elected, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, the, chemistry, section, of, the, swedish, academy, supported, this, recommendation, the, academy, was, then, supposed, to, approve, the, committee, s, choice, as, it, has, done, in, almost, every, case, unexpectedly, at, the, full, meeting, of, the, academy, a, dissenting, member, of, the, nobel, committee, peter, klason, proposed, the, candidacy, of, henri, moissan, whom, he, favored, svante, arrhenius, although, not, a, member, of, the, nobel, committee, for, chemistry, had, a, great, deal, of, influence, in, the, academy, and, also, pressed, for, the, rejection, of, mendeleev, arguing, that, the, periodic, system, was, too, old, to, acknowledge, its, discovery, in, 1906, according, to, the, contemporaries, arrhenius, was, motivated, by, the, grudge, he, held, against, mendeleev, for, his, critique, of, arrhenius, s, dissociation, theory, after, heated, arguments, the, majority, of, the, academy, chose, moissan, by, a, margin, of, one, vote, the, attempts, to, nominate, mendeleev, in, 1907, were, again, frustrated, by, the, absolute, opposition, of, arrhenius, in, 1907, mendeleev, died, at, the, age, of, 72, in, saint, petersburg, from, influenza, just, 6, days, short, of, his, 73rd, birthday, his, last, words, were, to, his, physician, doctor, you, have, science, i, have, faith, which, is, possibly, a, jules, verne, quote, mendeleev, made, other, important, contributions, to, science, the, russian, chemist, and, science, historian, lev, chugaev, characterized, him, as, a, chemist, of, genius, first, class, physicist, a, fruitful, researcher, in, the, fields, of, hydrodynamics, meteorology, geology, certain, branches, of, chemical, technology, explosives, petroleum, and, fuels, for, example, and, other, disciplines, adjacent, to, chemistry, and, physics, a, thorough, expert, of, chemical, industry, and, industry, in, general, and, an, original, thinker, in, the, field, of, economy, mendeleev, was, one, of, the, founders, in, 1868, of, the, russian, chemical, society, he, worked, on, the, theory, and, practice, of, protectionist, trade, and, on, agriculture, in, an, attempt, at, a, chemical, conception, of, the, aether, he, put, forward, a, hypothesis, that, there, existed, two, inert, chemical, elements, of, lesser, atomic, weight, than, hydrogen, of, these, two, proposed, elements, he, thought, the, lighter, to, be, an, all, penetrating, all, pervasive, gas, and, the, slightly, heavier, one, to, be, a, proposed, element, coronium, mendeleev, devoted, much, study, and, made, important, contributions, to, the, determination, of, the, nature, of, such, indefinite, compounds, as, solutions, in, another, department, of, physical, chemistry, he, investigated, the, expansion, of, liquids, with, heat, and, devised, a, formula, similar, to, gay, lussac, s, law, of, the, uniformity, of, the, expansion, of, gases, while, in, 1861, he, anticipated, thomas, andrews, conception, of, the, critical, temperature, of, gases, by, defining, the, absolute, boiling, point, of, a, substance, as, the, temperature, at, which, cohesion, and, heat, of, vaporization, become, equal, to, zero, and, the, liquid, changes, to, vapor, irrespective, of, the, pressure, and, volume, mendeleev, is, given, credit, for, the, introduction, of, the, metric, system, to, the, russian, empire, he, invented, pyrocollodion, a, kind, of, smokeless, powder, based, on, nitrocellulose, this, work, had, been, commissioned, by, the, russian, navy, which, however, did, not, adopt, its, use, in, 1892, mendeleev, organized, its, manufacture, mendeleev, studied, the, origns, of, petroleum, origin, he, concluded, that, hydrocarbons, are, abiogenic, and, form, deep, within, the, earth, see, abiogenic, petroleum, origin, he, wrote, the, capital, fact, to, note, is, that, petroleum, was, born, in, the, depths, of, the, earth, and, it, is, only, there, that, we, must, seek, its, origin, beginning, in, the, 1870s, he, published, widely, beyond, chemistry, looking, at, aspects, of, russian, industry, and, technical, issues, in, agricultural, productivity, he, explored, demographic, issues, sponsored, studies, of, the, arctic, sea, tried, to, measure, the, efficacy, of, chemical, fertilizers, and, promoted, the, merchant, navy, he, was, especially, active, in, improving, the, russian, petroleum, industry, making, detailed, comparisons, with, the, more, advanced, industry, in, pennsylvania, although, not, well, grounded, in, economics, he, had, observed, industry, throughout, his, european, travels, and, in, 1891, he, helped, convince, the, ministry, of, finance, to, impose, temporary, tariffs, with, the, aim, of, fostering, russian, infant, industries, in, 1890, he, resigned, his, professorship, at, st, petersburg, university, following, a, dispute, with, officials, at, the, ministry, of, education, over, the, treatment, of, university, students, in, 1892, he, was, appointed, director, of, russia, s, central, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, and, led, the, way, to, standardize, fundamental, prototypes, and, measurement, procedures, he, set, up, an, inspection, system, and, introduced, the, metric, system, to, russia, he, debated, against, the, scientific, claims, of, spiritualism, arguing, that, metaphysical, idealism, was, no, more, than, ignorant, superstition, he, bemoaned, the, widespread, acceptance, of, spiritualism, in, russian, culture, and, its, negative, effects, on, the, study, of, science, a, very, popular, russian, story, credits, mendeleev, with, setting, the, 40, standard, strength, of, vodka, for, example, russian, standard, vodka, advertises, in, 1894, dmitri, mendeleev, the, greatest, scientist, in, all, russia, received, the, decree, to, set, the, imperial, quality, standard, for, russian, vodka, and, the, russian, standard, was, born, others, cite, the, highest, quality, of, russian, vodka, approved, by, the, royal, government, commission, headed, by, mendeleev, in, 1894, in, fact, the, 40, standard, was, already, introduced, by, the, russian, government, in, 1843, when, mendeleev, was, nine, years, old, it, is, true, that, mendeleev, in, 1892, became, head, of, the, archive, of, weights, and, measures, in, saint, petersburg, and, evolved, it, into, a, government, bureau, the, following, year, but, that, institution, was, charged, with, standardising, russian, trade, weights, and, measuring, instruments, not, setting, any, production, quality, standards, also, mendeleev, s, 1865, doctoral, dissertation, was, entitled, a, discourse, on, the, combination, of, alcohol, and, water, but, it, only, discussed, medical, strength, alcohol, concentrations, over, 70, and, he, never, wrote, anything, about, vodka, a, number, of, places, and, objects, are, associated, with, the, name, and, achievements, of, the, scientist, in, saint, petersburg, his, name, was, given, to, d, i, mendeleev, institute, for, metrology, the, national, metrology, institute, dealing, with, establishing, and, supporting, national, and, worldwide, standards, for, precise, measurements, next, to, it, there, is, a, monument, to, him, that, consists, of, his, sitting, statue, and, a, depiction, of, his, periodic, table, on, the, wall, of, the, establishment, in, the, twelve, collegia, building, now, being, the, centre, of, saint, petersburg, state, university, and, in, mendeleev, s, time, head, pedagogical, institute, there, is, dmitry, mendeleev, s, memorial, museum, apartment, with, his, archives, the, street, in, front, of, these, is, named, after, him, as, mendeleevskaya, liniya, mendeleev, line, in, moscow, there, is, the, d, mendeleyev, university, of, chemical, technology, of, russia, mendelevium, which, is, a, synthetic, chemical, element, with, the, symbol, md, formerly, mv, and, the, atomic, number, 101, was, named, after, mendeleev, it, is, a, metallic, radioactive, transuranic, element, in, the, actinide, series, usually, synthesized, by, bombarding, einsteinium, with, alpha, particles, the, mineral, mendeleevite, ce, cs, 6, ce, 22, ca, 6, si, 70, o, 175, oh, f, 14, h, 2, o, 21, was, named,
