audience, as, he, slid, across, the, floor, flashing, hand, signals, and, splaying, his, pulsating, fingers, to, the, beat, of, the, music, although, audiences, thought, brown, s, dance, routine, was, part, of, his, act, this, practice, was, actually, his, way, of, pointing, to, the, offending, member, of, his, troupe, who, played, or, sang, the, wrong, note, or, committed, some, other, infraction, brown, used, his, splayed, fingers, and, hand, signals, to, alert, the, offending, person, of, the, fine, that, person, must, pay, to, him, for, breaking, his, rules, brown, s, demands, on, his, support, acts, could, be, harsh, as, fred, wesley, recalled, of, his, time, as, musical, director, of, the, jbs, if, brown, felt, intimidated, by, a, support, act, he, would, try, to, undermine, their, performances, by, shortening, their, sets, without, notice, demanding, that, they, not, do, certain, showstopping, songs, and, even, insisting, on, doing, the, unthinkable, playing, drums, on, some, of, their, songs, a, sure, set, killer, brown, s, main, social, activism, was, in, preserving, the, need, for, education, among, youths, influenced, by, his, own, troubled, childhood, and, his, being, forced, to, drop, out, of, the, seventh, grade, for, wearing, insufficient, clothes, due, to, heavy, dropout, rates, in, the, 1960s, brown, released, the, pro, education, song, don, t, be, a,

for, civil, rights, organizations, in, the, mid, 1960s, brown, often, shied, away, from, discussing, civil, rights, in, his, songs, in, fear, of, alienating, his, crossover, audience, in, 1968, in, response, to, a, growing, urge, of, anti, war, advocacy, during, the, vietnam, war, brown, recorded, the, song, america, is, my, home, in, the, song, brown, performed, a, rap, advocating, patriotism,

flaring, white, arranged, to, have, brown, s, performance, broadcast, multiple, times, on, boston, s, public, television, station, wgbh, thus, keeping, potential, rioters, off, the, streets, watching, the, concert, for, free, angered, by, not, being, told, of, this, brown, demanded, 60, 000, for, gate, fees, money, he, thought, would, be, lost, from, ticket, sales, on, account, of, the, concert, being, broadcast, for, free, and, then, threatened, to, go, public, about, the, secret, arrangement, when, the, city, balked, at, paying, up, afterwards, news, of, which, would, have, been, a, political, death, blow, to, white, and, spark, riots, of, its, own, white, eventually, lobbied, a, behind, the, scenes, power, brokering, group, known, as, the, vault, to, come, up, with, money, for, brown, s, gate, fee, and, other, social, programs, contributing, 100, 000, brown, received, 15, 000, from, them, via, the, city, white, also, persuaded, management, at, the, garden, to, give, up,

bigger, stance, on, their, issues, and, from, footage, of, black, on, black, crime, committed, in, inner, cities, brown, wrote, the, lyrics, to, the, song, say, it, loud, i, m, black, and, i, m, proud, which, his, bandleader, alfred, pee, wee, ellis, accompanied, with, a, musical, composition, released, late, that, summer, the, song, s, lyrics, helped, to, make, it, an, anthem, for, the, civil, rights, movement, brown, only, performed, the, song, sporadically, following, its, initial, release, and, later, stated, he, had, regrets, about, recording, it, saying, in, 1984, now, say, it, loud, i, m, black, and, i, m, proud, has, done, more, for, the, black, race, than, any, other, record, but, if, i, had, my, choice, i, wouldn, t, have, done, it, because, i, don, t, like, defining, anyone, by, race, to, teach, race, is, to, teach, separatism, in, his, autobiography, he, stated, the, song, is, obsolete, now, but, it, was, necessary, to, teach, pride, then, and, i, think, the,
