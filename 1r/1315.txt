his, upcoming, baptism, he, first, chose, both, john, and, peter, after, jesus, apostles, forced, by, the, missionaries, to, choose, just, one, he, chose, johnstone, the, stone, chosen, as, a,

gave, birth, to, kenyatta, s, son, peter, muigui, in, october, 1920, kenyatta, was, called, before, the, thogota, kirk, session, and, suspended, from, taking, holy, communion, the, suspension, was, in, response, to, his, drinking, and, his, relations, with, wahu, out, of, wedlock, the, church, insisted, that, a, traditional, kikuyu, wedding, would, be, inadequate, and, that, he, must, undergo, a, christian, marriage, this, took, place, on, 8, november, 1922, kenyatta, had, initially, refused, to, cease, drinking, but, in, july, 1923, officially, renounced, alcohol, and, was, allowed, to,

growing, sense, of, self, confidence, kenyatta, lived, in, the, kilimani, neighbourhood, of, nairobi, although, he, financed, the, construction, of, a, second, home, at, dagoretti, he, referred, to, this, latter, hut, as, the, kinyata, stores, for, he, used, it, to, hold, general, provisions, for, the, neighborhood, he, had, sufficient, funds, that, he, could, lend, money, to, european, clerks, in, the, offices, and, could, enjoy, the, lifestyle, offered, by, nairobi, which, included, cinemas, football, matches, and, imported, british, fashions, anti, imperialist, sentiment, was, on, the, rise, among, both, native, and, indian, communities, in, kenya, following, the, irish, war, of, independence, and, the, russian, october, revolution, many, indigenous, africans, resented, having, to, carry, kipande, identity, certificates, at, all, times, being, forbidden, from, growing, coffee, and, paying, taxes, without, political, representation, political, upheavals, occurred, in, kikuyuland, the, area, inhabited, largely, by, the, kikuyu, following, world, war, i, among, them, the, campaigns, of, harry, thuku, and, the, east, african, association, resulting, in, the, government, massacre, of, 21, native, protesters, in, march, 1922, kenyatta, had, not, taken, part, in, these, events, perhaps, so, as, not, to, disrupt, his, lucrative, employment, prospects, kenyatta, s, interest, in, politics, stemmed, from, his, friendship, with, james, beauttah, a, senior, figure, in, the, kikuyu, central, association, kca, beauttah, took, kenyatta, to, a, political, meeting, in, pumwani, although, this, led, to, no, firm, involvement, at, the, time, in, either, 1925, or, early, 1926, beauttah, moved, to, uganda, but, remained, in, contact, with, kenyatta, when, the, kca, wrote, to, beauttah, and, asked, him, to, travel, to, london, as, their, representative, he, declined, but, recommended, that, kenyatta, who, had, a, good, command, of, english, go, in, his, place, kenyatta, accepted, probably, on, the, condition, that, the, association, matched, his, pre, existing, wage, he, thus, became, the, group, s, secretary, it, is, likely, that, the, kca, purchased, a, motorbike, for, kenyatta, which, he, used, to, travel, around, kikuyuland, and, neighbouring, areas, inhabited, by, the, meru, and, embu, helping, to, establish, new, kca, branches, in, february, 1928, he, was,

group, both, the, kca, and, the, kikuyu, association, opposed, these, land, boards, which, treated, kikuyu, land, as, collectively, owned, rather, than, recognising, individual, kikuyu, land, ownership, also, in, february, his, daughter, wambui, margaret, was, born, by, this, point, he, was, increasingly, using, the, name, kenyatta, which, had, a, more, african, appearance, than, johnstone, in, may, 1928, the, kca, launched, a, kikuyu, language, magazine, m, igwithania, roughly, translated, as, the, reconciler, or, the, unifier, in, which, it, published, news, articles, and, homilies, its, purpose, was, to, help, unify, the, kikuyu, and, raise, funds, for, the, kca, kenyatta, was, listed, as, the, publication, s, editor, although, murray, brown, suggested, that, he, was, not, the, guiding, hand, behind, it, and, that, his, duties, were, largely, confined, to, translating, into, kikuyu, aware, that, thuku, had, been, exiled, for, his, activism, kenyatta, s, took, a, cautious, approach, to, campaigning, and, in, m, igwithania, he, expressed, support, for, the, churches, district, commissioners, and, chiefs, he, also, praised, the, british, empire, stating, that, the, first, thing, is, that, all, people, are, governed, justly, big, or, small, equally, the, second, thing, is, that, nobody, is, regarded, as, a, slave, everyone, is, free, to, do, what, he, or, she, likes, without, being, hindered, this, did, not, prevent, grigg, from, writing, to, the, authorities, in, london, requesting, permission, to, shut, the, magazine, down, after, the, kca, raised, sufficient, funds, in, february, 1929, kenyatta, sailed, from, mombasa, to, britain, grigg, s, administration, could, not, stop, kenyatta, s, journey, but, asked, london, s, colonial, office, not, to,

the, land, issue, and, thuku, s, exile, the, atmosphere, between, the, two, being, friendly, in, spite, of, this, following, the, meeting, grigg, convinced, special, branch, to, monitor, kenyatta,

situation, for, the, communist, party, of, great, britain, s, newspapers, the, daily, worker, and, sunday, worker, in, these, his, criticism, of, british, imperialism, was, far, stronger, than, it, had, been, in, mu, gwithania, these, communist, links, concerned, many, of, kenyatta, s, liberal, patrons, in, january, kenyatta, met, with, drummond, shiels, the, under, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, at, the, house, of, commons, kenyatta, told, shiels, that, he, was, not, affiliated, with, communist, circles, and, was, unaware, of, the, nature, of, the, newspaper, which, published, his, articles, shiels, advised, kenyatta, to, return, home, to, promote, kikuyu, involvement, in, the, constitutional, process, and, discourage, violence, and, extremism, after, eighteen, months, in, europe, kenyatta, had, run, out, of, money, the, anti, slavery, society, advanced, him, funds, to, pay, off, his, debts, and, return, to, kenya, although, kenyatta, enjoyed, life, in, london, and, feared, arrest, if, he, returned, home, he, sailed, back, to, mombasa, in, september, 1930, on, his, return, his, prestige, among, the, kikuyu, was, high, because, of, his, time, spent, in, europe, in, his, absence, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, had, become, a, topic, of, strong, debate, in, kikuyu, society, the, protestant, churches, backed, by, european, medics, and, the, colonial, authorities, supported, the, abolition, of, this, traditional, practice, but, the, kca, rallied, to, its, defence, claiming, that, its, abolition, would, damage, the, structure, of, kikuyu, society, anger, between, the, two, sides, had, heightened, several, churches, expelling, kca, members, from, their, congregations, and, it, was, widely, believed, that, the, january, 1930, killing, of, an, american, missionary, hulda, stumpf, had, been, due, to, the, issue, as, secretary, of, the, kca, kenyatta, met, with, church, representatives, he, expressed, the, view, that, although, personally, opposing, fgm, he, regarded, its, legal, abolition, as, counter, productive, and, argued, that, the, churches, should, focus, on, eradicating, the, practice, through, educating, people, about, its, harmful, effects, on, women, s, health, the, meeting, ended, without, compromise, and, john, arthur, the, head, of, the, church, of, scotland, in, kenya, later, expelled, kenyatta, from, the, church, citing, what, he, deemed, dishonesty, during, the, debate, in, 1931, kenyatta, took, his, son, out, of, the, church, school, at, thogota, and, enrolled, him, in, a, kca, approved, independent, school,

colonialism, in, it, kenyatta, challenged, the, eurocentric, view, of, history, by, presenting, an, image, of, a, golden, african, past, by, emphasising, the, perceived, order, virtue, and, self, sufficiency, of, kikuyu, society, utilising, a, functionalist, framework, he, promoted, the, idea, that, traditional, kikuyu, society, had, a, cohesion, and, integrity, that, was, better, than, anything, offered, by, european, colonialism, in, this, book, kenyatta, made, clear, his, belief, that, the, rights, of, the, individual, should, be, downgraded, in, favour, of, the, interests, of, the, group, the, book, also, reflected, his, changing, views, on, female, genital, mutilation, where, once, he, opposed, it, he, now, unequivocally, supported, the, practice, downplaying, the, medical, dangers, that, it, posed, to, women, the, book, s, jacket, cover, featured, an, image, of, kenyatta, in, traditional, dress, wearing, a, skin, cloak, over, one, shoulder, and, carrying, a,

from, its, scabbard, facing, mount, kenya, was, a, commercial, failure, selling, only, 517, copies, but, was, generally, well, received, an, exception, was, among, white, kenyans, whose, assumptions, about, the, kikuyu, being, primitive, savages, in, need, of, european, civilization, it, challenged, murray, brown, later, described, it, as, a, propaganda, tour, de, force, no, other, african, had, made, such, an, uncompromising, stand, for, tribal, integrity, bodil, folke, frederiksen, a, scholar, of, development, studies, referred, to, it, as, probably, the, most, well, known, and, influential, african, scholarly, work, of, its, time, while, for, fellow, scholar, simon, gikandi, it, was, one, of, the, major, texts, in, what, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, invention, of, tradition, in, colonial, africa, in, the, last, war, 300, 000, of, my, people, fought, in, the, british, army, to, drive, the, germans, from, east, africa, and, 60, 000, of, them, lost, their, lives, in, this, war, large, numbers, of, my, people, have, been, fighting, to, smash, fascist, power, in, africa, and, have, borne, some, of, the, hardest, fights, against, the, italians, surely, if, we, are, considered, fit, enough, to, take, our, rifles, and, fight, side, by, side, with, white, men, we, have, a, right, to, a, direct, say, in, the, running, of, our, country, and, to, education,

country, including, to, groups, of, east, african, soldiers, stationed, in, britain, he, became, frustrated, by, the, distance, between, him, and, kenya, telling, edna, that, he, felt, like, a, general, separated, by, 5000, miles, from, his, troops, while, he, was, absent, kenya, s, authorities, banned, the, kca, in, 1940, kenyatta, and, other, senior, iasb, members, began, planning, the,

spoke, at, the, conference, although, made, no, particular, impact, on, the, proceedings, much, of, the, debate, that, took, place, centred, on, whether, indigenous, africans, should, continue, pursuing, a, gradual, campaign, for, independence, or, whether, they, should, seek, the, military, overthrow, of, the, european, imperialists, the, conference, ended, with, a, statement, declaring, that, while, delegates, desired, a, peaceful, transition, to, african, self, rule, africans, as, a, last, resort, may, have, to, appeal, to, force, in, the, effort, to, achieve, freedom, kenyatta, supported, this, resolution, although, was, more, cautious, than, other, delegates, and, made, no, open, commitment, to, violence, he, subsequently, authored, an, iasb, pamphlet, kenya, the, land, of, conflict, in, which, he, blended, political, calls, for, independence, with, romanticised, descriptions, of, an, idealised, pre, colonial, african, past, after, british, victory, in, world, war, ii, kenyatta, received, a, request, to, return, to, kenya, in, september, 1946, sailing, back, that, month, he, decided, not, to, bring, edna, who, was, pregnant, with, a, second, child, with, him, aware, that, if, they, joined, him, in, kenya, their, lives, would, be, made, very, difficult, by, the, colony, s, racial, laws, on, his, arrival, in, mombasa, kenyatta, was, greeted, by, his, first, wife,

take, full, control, of, the, college, under, kenyatta, s, leadership, additional, funds, were, raised, for, the, construction, of, school, buildings, and, the, number, of, boys, in, attendance, rose, from, 250, to, 900, it, was, also, beset, with, problems, including, a, decline, in, standards, and, teachers, strikes, over, non, payment, of, wages, gradually, the, number, of, enrolled, pupils,

kikuyu, press, began, describing, him, as, the, saviour, great, elder, and, hero, of, our, race, he, was, nevertheless, aware, that, to, achieve, independence, kau, needed, the, support, of, other, indigenous, tribes, and, ethnic, groups, this, was, made, difficult, by, the, fact, that, many, maasai, and, luo, tribes, traditionally, hostile, to, the, kikuyu, regarded, him, as, an, advocate, of, kikuyu, dominance, he, insisted, on, intertribal, representation, on, the, kau, executive, and, ensured, that, party, business, was, conducted, in, swahili, the, lingua, franca, of, indigenous, kenyans, to, attract, support, from, kenya, s, indian, community, he, made, contact, with, jawaharlal, nehru, the, first, prime, minister, of, the, new, indian, republic, nehru, s, response, was, supportive, sending, a, message, to, kenya, s, indian, minority, reminding, them, that, they, were, the, guests, of, the, indigenous, african, population, relations, with, the, white, minority,

too, increasingly, called, for, further, kenyan, autonomy, from, the, british, government, but, wanted, continued, white, minority, rule, and, closer, links, to, the, white, minority, governments, of, south, africa, northern, rhodesia, and, southern, rhodesia, they, viewed, britain, s, newly, elected, labour, government, with, great, suspicion, the, white, electors, union, put, forward, a, kenya, plan, which, proposed, greater, white, settlement, in, kenya, bringing, tanganyika, into, the, british, empire, and, incorporating, it, within, their, new, british, east, african, dominion, in, april, 1950, kenyatta, was, present, at, a, joint, meeting, of, kau, and, the, east, african, indian, national, congress, in, which, they, both, expressed, opposition, to, the, kenya, plan, by, 1952,

workers, strikes, he, called, on, his, supporters, to, work, hard, and, to, abandon, laziness, theft, and, crime, he, also, insisted, that, in, an, independent, kenya, all, racial, groups, would, be, safeguarded, kenyatta, s, gradualist, and, peaceful, approach, contrasted, with, the, growth, of, the, mau, mau, uprising, as, armed, guerrilla, groups, began, targeting, the, white, minority, and, members, of, the, kikuyu, community, who, did, not, support, them, by, 1959, the, mau, mau, had, killed, around, 1, 880, people, for, many, young, mau, mau, militants, kenyatta, was, regarded, as, a,

publicly, distanced, himself, from, the, mau, mau, in, april, 1952, he, began, a, speaking, tour, in, which, he, denounced, the, mau, mau, to, assembled, crowds, insisting, that, independence, must, be, achieved, through, peaceful, means, in, august, he, attended, a, much, publicised, mass, meeting, in, kiambu, where, in, front, of, 30, 000, people, he, said, that, mau, mau, has, spoiled, the, country, let, mau, mau, perish, forever, all, people, should, search, for, mau, mau, and, kill, it, despite, kenyatta, s, vocal, opposition, to, the, mau, mau, kau, had, moved, towards, a, position, of, greater, militancy, at, its, 1951, agm, more, militant, african, nationalists, had, taken, senior, positions, and, the, party, officially, announced, its, call, for, kenyan, independence, within, three, years, in, january, 1952, kau, members, formed, a, secret, central, committee, devoted, to, direct, action, formulated, along, a, cell, structure, whatever, kenyatta, s, views, on, these, developments, he, had, little, ability, to, control, them, he, was, increasingly, frustrated, and, without, the, intellectual, companionship, he, experienced, in, britain, felt, lonely, we, africans, are, in, the, majority, and, we, should, have, self, government, that, does, not, mean, we, should, not, take, account, of, whites, provided, we, have, the, key, position, we, want, to, be, friendly,

of, his, situation, kenya, s, authorities, believed, that, detaining, kenyatta, would, help, quell, civil, unrest, many, white, settlers, wanted, him, exiled, but, the, government, feared, this, would, turn, him, into, a, martyr, for, the, anti, colonialist, cause, they, thought, it, better, that, he, be, convicted, and, imprisoned, although, at, the, time, had, nothing, to, charge, him, with, and, so, began, searching, his, personal, files, for, evidence, of, criminal, activity, eventually, they, charged, him, and, five, senior, kau, members, with, masterminding, the, mau, mau, a, proscribed, group, the, historian, john, m, lonsdale, stated, that, kenyatta, had, been, made, a, scapegoat, while, the, historian, a, b, assensoh, later, suggested, that, the, authorities, knew,

he, had, ever, presented, during, his, career, according, to, murray, brown, it, is, likely, that, political, rather, than, legal, considerations, informed, their, decision, to, reject, the, case,

national, members, elected, by, a, pan, racial, electorate, it, was, clear, to, all, concerned, that, kenyatta, was, going, to, be, the, key, to, the, future, of, kenyan, politics, after, the, lancaster, house, negotiations, the, anti, colonial, movement, had, split, into, two, parties, the, kenya, african, national, union, kanu, which, was, dominated, by, kikuyu, and, luo, and, the, kenya, african, democratic, union, kadu, which, was, led, largely, by, members, of, smaller, ethnic, groups, like, the, kalenjin, and, maasai, in, may, 1960, kanu, nominated, kenyatta, as, its, president, although, the, government, vetoed, it, insisting, that, he, had, been, an, instigator, of, the, mau, mau, kanu, then, declared, that, it, would, refuse, to, take, part, in, any, government, unless, kenyatta, was, freed, kanu, campaigned, on, the, issue, of, kenyatta, s, detainment, in, the, february, 1961, election, where, it, gained, a, majority, of, votes, kanu, nevertheless, refused, to, form, a, government, which, was, instead, created, through, a, kadu, led, coalition, of, smaller, parties, kenyatta, had, kept, abreast, of, these, developments, although, he, had, refused, to, back, either, kanu, or, kadu, instead, insisting, on, unity, between, the, two, parties, renison, decided, to, release, kenyatta, before, kenya, achieved, independence, he, thought, public, exposure, to, kenyatta, prior, to, elections, would, make, the, populace, less, likely, to, vote, for, a, man, renison, regarded, as, a, violent, extremist, in, april, 1961, the, government, flew, kenyatta, to, maralal, where, he, maintained, his, innocence, of, the, charges, but, told, reporters, that, he, bore, no, grudges, he, reiterated, that, he, had, never, supported, violence, or, the, illegal, oathing, system, used, by, the, mau, mau, and, denied, having, ever, been, a, marxist, stating, i, shall, always, remain, an, african, nationalist, to, the, end, in, august, he, was, moved, to, gatundu, in, kikuyuland, where, he, was, greeted, by, a, crowd, of, 10, 000, there, the, colonial, government, had, built, him, a, new, house, to, replace, that, they, had, demolished, now, a, free, man, he, travelled, to, cities, like, nairobi, and, mombasa, to, make, public, appearances, after, his, release, kenyatta, set, about, trying, to, ensure, that, he, was, the, only, realistic, option, as, kenya, s, future, leader, in, august, he, met, with, renison, at, kiambu, and, was, interviewed, by, the, bbc, s, face, to, face, in, october, 1961, kenyatta, formally, joined, kanu, and, accepted, its, presidency, in, january, 1962, he, was, elected, unopposed, as, kanu, s, representative, for, the, fort, hall, constituency, in, the, legislative, council, after, its, sitting, member, kariuki, njiiri, resigned, kenyatta, traveled, elsewhere, in, africa, visiting, tanganyika, in, october, 1961, and, ethiopia, in, november, at, the, invitation, of, their, governments, a, key, issue, facing, kenya, was, a, border, dispute, in, north, east, province, alongside, somalia, ethnic, somalis, inhabited, this, region, and, claimed, it, should, be, part, of, somalia, not, kenya, kenyatta, disagreed, insisting, the, land, remain, kenyan, and, stated, that, somalis, in, kenya, should, pack, up, camels, and, go, to, somalia, in, june, 1962, kenyatta, travelled, to, mogadishu, to, discuss, the, issue, with, the, somalian, authorities, but, the, two, sides, could, not, reach, an, agreement, kenyatta, sought, to, gain, the, confidence, of, the, white, settler, community, in, 1962, the, white, minority, had, produced, 80, of, the, country, s, exports, and, were, a, vital, part, of, its, economy, yet, between, 1962, and, 1963, they, were, emigrating, at, a, rate, of, 700, a, month, kenyatta, feared, that, this, white, exodus, would, cause, a, brain, drain, and, skills, shortage, that, would, be, detrimental, to, the, economy, he, was, also, aware, that, the, confidence, of, the, white, minority, would, be, crucial, to, securing, western, investment, in, kenya, s, economy, kenyatta, made, it, clear, that, when, in, power, he, would, not, sack, any, white, civil, servants, unless, there, were, competent, black, individuals, capable, of, replacing, them, he, was, sufficiently, successful, that, several, prominent, white, kenyans, backed, kanu, in, the, subsequent, election, in, 1962, he, returned, to, london, to, attend, one, of, the, lancaster, house, conferences, there, kanu, and, kadu, representatives, met, with, british, officials, to, formulate, a, new, constitution, kadu, desired, a, federalist, state, organised, on, a, system, they, called, majimbo, with, six, largely, autonomous, regional, authorities, a, two, chamber, legislature, and, a, central, federal, council, of, ministers, who, would, select, a, rotating, chair, to, serve, as, head, of, government, for, a, one, year, term, renison, s, administration, and, most, white, settlers, favoured, this, system, as, it, would, prevent, a, strong, central, government, implementing, radical, reform, kanu, opposed, majimbo, believing, that, it, served, entrenched, interests, and, denied, equal, opportunities, across, kenya, they, also, insisted, on, an, elected, head, of, government, at, kenyatta, s, prompting, kanu, conceded, to, some, of, kadu, s, demands, he, was, aware, that, he, could, amend, the, constitution, when, in, office, the, new, constitution, divided, kenya, into, six, regions, each, with, a, regional, assembly, but, also, featured, a, strong, central, government, and, both, an, upper, and, a, lower, house, it, was, agreed, that, a, temporary, coalition, government, would, be, established, until, independence, several, kanu, politicians, being, given, ministerial, posts, kenyatta, accepted, a, minor, position, that, of, the, minister, of, state, for, constitutional, affairs, and, economic, planning, the, british, government, considered, renison, too, ill, at, ease, with, indigenous, africans, to, oversee, the, transition, to, independence, and, thus, replaced, him, with, malcolm, macdonald, as, governor, of, kenya, in, january, 1963, macdonald, and, kenyatta, developed, a, strong, friendship, the, briton, referred, to, the, latter, as, the, wisest, and, perhaps, strongest, as, well, as, most, popular, potential, prime, minister, of, the, independent, nation, to, be, macdonald, sped, up, plans, for, kenyan, independence, believing, that, the, longer, the, wait, the, greater, the, opportunity, for, radicalisation, among, african, nationalists, an, election, was, scheduled, for, may, with, self, government, in, june, followed, by, full, independence, in, december, 1964, the, may, 1963, general, election, pitted, kenyatta, s, kanu, against, kadu, the, akamba, people, s, party, and, various, independent, candidates, kanu, was, victorious, with, 83, seats, out, of, 124, in, the, house, of, representatives, a, kanu, majority, government, replaced, the, pre, existing, coalition, on, 1, june, 1963, kenyatta, was, sworn, in, as, prime, minister, of, the, autonomous, kenyan, government, kenya, remained, a, monarchy, with, queen, elizabeth, ii, as, its, head, of, state, in, november, 1963, kenyatta, s, government, introduced, a, law, making, it, a, criminal, offence, to, disrespect, the, prime, minister, exile, being, the, punishment, kenyatta, s, personality, became, a, central, aspect, of, the, creation, of, the, new, state, in, december, nairobi, s, delamere, avenue, was, renamed, kenyatta, avenue, and, a, bronze, statue, of, him, was, erected, beside, the, country, s, national, assembly, photographs, of, kenyatta, were, widely, displayed, in, shop, windows, and, his, face, was, also, printed, on, the, new, currency, in, 1964, oxford, university, press, published, a, collection, of, kenyatta, s, speeches, under, the, title, of, harambee, kenya, s, first, cabinet, included, not, only, kikuyu, but, also, members, of, the, luo, kamba, kisii, and, maragoli, tribal, groups, in, june, 1963, kenyatta, met, with, julius, nyerere, and, ugandan, president, milton, obote, in, nairobi, the, trio, discussed, the, possibility, of, merging, their, three, nations, plus, zanzibar, into, a, single, east, african, federation, agreeing, that, this, would, be, accomplished, by, the, end, of, the, year, privately, kenyatta, was, more, reluctant, regarding, the, arrangement, and, as, 1964, came, around, the, federation, had, not, come, to, pass, many, radical, voices, in, kenya, urged, him, to, pursue, the, project, in, may, 1964, kenyatta, rejected, a, back, benchers, resolution, calling, for, speedier, federation, he, publicly, stated, that, talk, of, a, federation, had, always, been, a, ruse, to, hasten, the, pace, of, kenyan, independence, from, britain, but, nyerere, denied, that, this, was, true, continuing, to, emphasize, good, relations, with, the, white, settlers, in, august, 1963, kenyatta, met, with, 300, white, farmers, at, nakuru, he, reassured, them, that, they, would, be, safe, and, welcome, in, an, independent, kenya, and, more, broadly, talked, of, forgiving, and, forgetting, the, conflicts, of, the, past, despite, his, attempts, at, wooing, white, support, he, did, not, do, the, same, with, the, indian, minority, like, many, indigenous, africans, in, kenya, kenyatta, bore, a, sense, of, resentment, towards, this, community, despite, the, role, that, many, indians, had, played, in, securing, the, country, s, independence, he, also, encouraged, the, remaining, mau, mau, fighters, to, leave, the, forests, and, settle, in, society, throughout, kenyatta, s, rule, many, of, these, individuals, remained, out, of, work, unemployment, being, one, of, the, most, persistent, problems, facing, his, government, a, celebration, to, mark, independence, was, held, in, a, specially, constructed, stadium, on, 12, december, 1963, during, the, ceremony, prince, philip, duke, of, edinburgh, representing, the, british, monarchy, formally, handed, over, control, of, the, country, to, kenyatta, also, in, attendance, were, leading, figures, from, the, mau, mau, in, a, speech, kenyatta, described, it, as, the, greatest, day, in, kenya, s, history, and, the, happiest, day, in, my, life, he, had, flown, edna, and, peter, over, for, the, ceremony, and, in, kenya, they, were, welcomed, into, kenyatta, s, family, by, his, other, wives, disputes, with, somalia, over, the, northern, frontier, district, nfd, continued, for, much, of, kenyatta, s, rule, somalia, remained, the, major, threat, to, his, government, to, deal, with, sporadic, violence, in, the, region, by, somali, shifta, guerrillas, kenyatta, sent, soldiers, into, the, region, in, december, 1963, and, gave, them, broad, powers, of, arrest, and, seizure, in, the, nfd, in, september, 1964, british, troops, were, assigned, to, assist, the, kenyan, army, in, the, region, kenyatta, also, faced, domestic, opposition, in, january, 1964, sections, of, the, army, launched, a, mutiny, in, nairobi, and, kenyatta, called, on, the, british, army, to, put, down, the, rebellion, similar, armed, uprisings, had, taken, place, that, month, in, neighboring, uganda, and, tanganyika, kenyatta, was, outraged, and, shaken, by, the, mutiny, he, publicly, rebuked, the, mutineers, emphasising, the, need, for, law, and, order, in, kenya, to, prevent, further, military, unrest, he, brought, in, a, review, of, the, salaries, of, the, army, police, and, prison, staff, leading, to, pay, rises, kenyatta, also, wanted, to, contain, parliamentary, opposition, and, at, kenyatta, s, prompting, in, november, 1964, kadu, officially, dissolved, and, its, representatives, joined, kanu, two, of, the, senior, members, of, kadu, ronald, ngala, and, daniel, arap, moi, subsequently, became, some, of, kenyatta, s, most, loyal, supporters, kenya, therefore, became, a, de, facto, one, party, state, in, december, 1964, kenya, was, officially, proclaimed, a, republic, kenyatta, became, its, executive, president, combining, the, roles, of, head, of, state, and, head, of, government, over, the, course, of, 1965, and, 1966, several, constitutional, amendments, enhanced, the, president, s, power, for, instance, a, may, 1966, amendment, gave, the, president, the, ability, to, order, the, detention, of, individuals, without, trial, if, he, thought, the, security, of, the, state, was, threatened, seeking, the, support, of, kenya, s, second, largest, ethnic, group, the, luo, kenyatta, appointed, the, luo, oginga, odinga, as, his, vice, president, the, kikuyu, who, made, up, around, 20, percent, of, population, still, held, most, of, the, country, s, important, government, and, administrative, positions, this, contributed, to, a, perception, among, many, kenyans, that, independence, had, simply, seen, the, dominance, of, a, british, elite, replaced, by, the, dominance, of, a, kikuyu, elite, kenyatta, s, calls, to, forgive, and, forget, the, past, were, a, keystone, of, his, government, he, preserved, some, elements, of, the, old, colonial, order, particularly, in, relation, to, law, and, order, the, police, and, military, structures, were, left, largely, intact, white, kenyans, were, left, in, senior, positions, within, the, judiciary, civil, service, and, parliament, with, the, white, kenyans, bruce, mackenzie, and, humphrey, slade, being, among, kenyatta, s, top, officials, kenyatta, s, government, nevertheless, rejected, the, idea, that, the, european, and, asian, minorities, could, be, permitted, dual, citizenship, expecting, these, communities, to, offer, total, loyalty, to, the, independent, kenyan, state, his, administration, pressured, whites, only, social, clubs, to, adopt, multi, racial, entry, policies, and, in, 1964, schools, formerly, reserved, for, european, pupils, were, opened, to, africans, and, asians, kenyatta, s, government, believed, it, necessary, to, cultivate, a, united, kenyan, national, culture, to, this, end, it, made, efforts, to, assert, the, dignity, of, indigenous, african, cultures, which, missionaries, and, colonial, authorities, had, belittled, as, primitive, an, east, african, literature, bureau, was, created, to, publish, the, work, of, indigenous, writers, the, kenya, cultural, centre, supported, indigenous, art, and, music, and, hundreds, of, traditional, music, and, dance, groups, were, formed, kenyatta, personally, insisted, that, such, performances, were, held, at, all, national, celebrations, support, was, given, to, the, preservation, of, historic, and, cultural, monuments, while, street, names, referencing, colonial, figures, were, renamed, and, symbols, of, colonialism, like, the, statue, of, british, settler, hugh, cholmondeley, 3rd, baron, delamere, in, nairobi, city, centre, were, removed, the, government, encouraged, the, use, of, swahili, as, a, national, language, although, english, remained, the, main, medium, for, parliamentary, debates, and, the, language, of, instruction, in, schools, and, universities, the, historian, robert, m, maxon, nevertheless, suggested, that, no, national, culture, emerged, during, the, kenyatta, era, most, artistic, and, cultural, expressions, reflecting, particular, ethnic, groups, rather, than, a, broader, sense, of, kenyanness, while, western, culture, remained, heavily, influential, over, the, country, s, elites, independent, kenya, had, an, economy, heavily, molded, by, colonial, rule, agriculture, dominated, while, industry, was, limited, and, there, was, a, heavy, reliance, on, exporting, primary, goods, while, importing, capital, and, manufactured, goods, under, kenyatta, the, structure, of, this, economy, did, not, fundamentally, change, remaining, externally, oriented, and, dominated, by, multinational, corporations, and, foreign, capital, kenyatta, s, economic, policy, was, capitalist, and, entrepreneurial, with, no, serious, socialist, policies, being, pursued, its, focus, was, on, achieving, economic, growth, as, opposed, to, equitable, redistribution, the, government, passed, laws, to, encourage, foreign, investment, recognising, that, kenya, needed, foreign, trained, specialists, in, scientific, and, technical, fields, to, aid, its, economic, development, under, kenyatta, western, companies, regarded, kenya, as, a, safe, and, profitable, place, for, investment, between, 1964, and, 1970, large, scale, foreign, investment, and, industry, in, kenya, nearly, doubled, in, contrast, to, his, economic, policies, kenyatta, publicly, claimed, he, would, create, a, democratic, socialist, state, with, an, equitable, distribution, of, economic, and, social, development, in, 1965, when, thomas, mboya, was, minister, for, economic, planning, and, development, the, government, issued, a, session, paper, titled, african, socialism, and, its, application, to, planning, in, kenya, in, which, it, officially, declared, its, commitment, to, what, it, called, an, african, socialist, economic, model, the, session, proposed, a, mixed, economy, with, an, important, role, for, private, capital, with, kenyatta, s, government, specifying, that, it, would, consider, only, nationalisation, in, instances, where, national, security, was, at, risk, left, wing, critics, highlighted, that, the, image, of, african, socialism, portrayed, in, the, document, provided, for, no, major, shift, away, from, the, colonial, economy, kenya, s, agricultural, and, industrial, sectors, were, dominated, by, europeans, and, its, commerce, and, trade, by, asians, one, of, kenyatta, s, most, pressing, issues, was, to, bring, the, economy, under, indigenous, control, there, was, growing, black, resentment, towards, the, asian, domination, of, the, small, business, sector, with, kenyatta, s, government, putting, pressure, on, asian, owned, businesses, intending, to, replace, them, with, african, owned, counterparts, the, 1965, session, paper, promised, an, africanization, of, the, kenyan, economy, with, the, government, increasingly, pushing, for, black, capitalism, the, government, established, the, industrial, and, commercial, development, corporation, to, provide, loans, for, black, owned, businesses, and, secured, a, 51, share, in, the, kenya, national, assurance, company, in, 1965, the, government, established, the, kenya, national, trading, corporation, to, ensure, indigenous, control, over, the, trade, in, essential, commodities, while, the, trade, licensing, act, of, 1967, prohibited, non, citizens, from, involvement, in, the, rice, sugar, and, maize, trade, during, the, 1970s, this, expanded, to, cover, the, trade, in, soap, cement, and, textiles, many, asians, who, had, retained, british, citizenship, were, affected, by, these, measures, between, late, 1967, and, early, 1968, growing, numbers, of, kenyan, asians, migrated, to, britain, in, february, 1968, large, numbers, migrated, quickly, before, a, legal, change, revoked, their, right, to, do, so, kenyatta, was, not, sympathetic, to, those, leaving, kenya, s, identity, as, an, african, country, is, not, going, to, be, altered, by, the, whims, and, malaises, of, groups, of, uncommitted, individuals, under, kenyatta, corruption, became, widespread, throughout, the, government, civil, service, and, business, community, kenyatta, and, his, family, were, tied, up, with, this, corruption, as, they, enriched, themselves, through, the, mass, purchase, of, property, after, 1963, their, acquisitions, in, the, central, rift, valley, and, coast, provinces, aroused, great, anger, among, landless, kenyans, his, family, used, his, presidential, position, to, circumvent, legal, or, administrative, obstacles, to, acquiring, property, the, kenyatta, family, also, heavily, invested, in, the, coastal, hotel, business, kenyatta, personally, owning, the, leonard, beach, hotel, other, businesses, they, were, involved, with, included, ruby, mining, in, tsavo, national, park, the, casino, business, the, charcoal, trade, which, was, causing, significant, deforestation, and, the, ivory, trade, the, kenyan, press, which, was, largely, loyal, to, kenyatta, did, not, delve, into, this, issue, it, was, only, after, his, death, that, publications, appeared, revealing, the, scale, of, his, personal, enrichment, kenyan, corruption, and, kenyatta, s, role, in, it, was, better, known, in, britain, although, many, of, his, british, friends, including, mcdonald, and, brockway, chose, to, believe, kenyatta, was, not, personally, involved, despite, kenyatta, s, shortcomings, on, economic, policy, compared, with, the, economic, performance, of, the, vast, majority, of, countries, in, independent, africa, kenya, s, economic, success, during, kenyatta, s, tenure, was, outstanding, during, the, years, following, its, independence, in, december, 1963, kenya, attained, such, a, high, rate, of, economic, growth, that, it, came, to, be, widely, regarded, as, something, of, an, economic, miracle, according, to, world, bank, figures, kenya, s, economy, attained, an, average, growth, rate, of, 6, 4, percent, per, year, from, 1965, to, 1980, among, the, 40, or, more, independent, countries, in, sub, saharan, africa, only, 3, exceeded, that, growth, rate, nigeria, ivory, coast, and, botswana, kenyatta, s, success, can, be, attributed, to, his, focus, on, the, agricultural, sector, particularly, on, cash, crops, such, as, tea, and, coffee, the, question, of, land, ownership, had, deep, emotional, resonance, in, kenya, having, been, a, major, grievance, against, the, british, colonialists, as, part, of, the, lancaster, house, negotiations, britain, s, government, agreed, to, provide, kenya, with, 27, million, with, which, to, buy, out, white, farmers, and, redistribute, their, land, among, the, indigenous, population, to, ease, this, transition, kenyatta, made, bruce, mckenzie, a, white, farmer, the, minister, of, agriculture, and, land, kenyatta, s, government, encouraged, the, establishment, of, private, land, buying, companies, that, were, often, headed, by, prominent, politicians, the, government, sold, or, leased, lands, in, the, former, white, highlands, to, these, companies, which, in, turn, subdivided, them, among, individual, shareholders, in, this, way, the, land, redistribution, programs, favoured, the, ruling, party, s, chief, constituency, kenyatta, himself, expanded, the, land, that, he, owned, around, gatundu, kenyans, who, made, claims, to, land, on, the, basis, of, ancestral, ownership, often, found, the, land, given, to, other, people, including, kenyans, from, different, parts, of, the, country, voices, began, to, condemn, the, redistribution, in, 1969, the, mp, jean, marie, seroney, censured, the, sale, of, historically, nandi, lands, in, the, rift, to, non, nandi, describing, the, settlement, schemes, as, kenyatta, s, colonization, of, the, rift, in, part, fuelled, by, high, rural, unemployment, kenya, witnessed, growing, rural, to, urban, migration, under, kenyatta, s, government, this, exacerbated, urban, unemployment, and, housing, shortages, with, squatter, settlements, and, slums, growing, up, and, urban, crime, rates, rising, kenyatta, was, concerned, by, this, and, promoted, the, reversal, of, this, rural, to, urban, migration, but, in, this, was, unsuccessful, kenyatta, s, government, was, eager, to, control, the, country, s, trade, unions, fearing, their, ability, to, disrupt, the, economy, to, this, end, it, emphasised, social, welfare, schemes, over, traditional, industrial, institutions, and, in, 1965, transformed, the, kenya, federation, of, labour, into, the, central, organization, of, trade, cot, a, body, which, came, under, strong, government, influence, no, strikes, could, be, legally, carried, out, in, kenya, without, cot, s, permission, there, were, also, measures, to, africanise, the, civil, service, which, by, mid, 1967, had, become, 91, african, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, public, sector, grew, faster, than, the, private, sector, the, growth, in, the, public, sector, contributed, to, the, significant, expansion, of, the, indigenous, middle, class, in, kenyatta, s, kenya, the, government, oversaw, a, massive, expansion, in, education, facilities, in, june, 1963, kenyatta, ordered, the, ominda, commission, to, determine, a, framework, for, meeting, kenya, s, educational, needs, their, report, set, out, the, long, term, goal, of, universal, free, primary, education, in, kenya, but, argued, that, the, government, s, emphasis, should, be, on, secondary, and, higher, education, to, facilitate, the, training, of, indigenous, african, personnel, to, take, over, the, civil, service, and, other, jobs, requiring, such, an, education, between, 1964, and, 1966, the, number, of, primary, schools, grew, by, 11, 6, and, the, number, of, secondary, schools, by, 80, by, the, time, of, kenyatta, s, death, kenya, s, first, universities, the, university, of, nairobi, and, kenyatta, university, had, been, established, although, kenyatta, died, without, having, attained, the, goal, of, free, universal, primary, education, in, kenya, the, country, had, made, significant, advances, in, that, direction, with, 85, of, kenyan, children, in, primary, education, and, within, a, decade, of, independence, had, trained, sufficient, numbers, of, indigenous, africans, to, take, over, the, civil, service, another, priority, for, kenyatta, s, government, was, improving, access, to, healthcare, services, it, stated, that, its, long, term, goal, was, to,

number, of, expatriates, in, those, positions, in, 1965, the, government, introduced, free, medical, services, for, out, patients, and, children, by, kenyatta, s, death, the, majority, of, kenyans, had, access, to, significantly, better, healthcare, than, they, had, had, in, the, colonial, period, before, independence, the, average, life, expectancy, in, kenya, was, 45, but, by, the, end, of, the, 1970s, it, was, 55, the, second, highest, in, sub, saharan, africa, this, improved, medical, care, had, resulted, in, declining, mortality, rates, while, birth, rates, remained, high, resulting, in, a, rapidly, growing, population, from, 1962, to, 1979, kenya, s, population, grew, by, just, under, 4, a, year, the, highest, rate, in, the, world, at, the, time, this, put, a, severe, strain, on, social, services, kenyatta, s, government, promoted, family, planning, projects, to, stem, the, birth, rate, but, these, had, little, success, in, part, due, to, his, advanced, years, kenyatta, rarely, traveled, outside, of, eastern, africa, under, kenyatta, kenya, was, largely, uninvolved, in, the, affairs, of, other, states, including, those, in, the, east, african, community, despite, his, reservations, about, any, immediate, east, african, federation, in, june, 1967, kenyatta, signed, the, treaty, for, east, african, co, operation, in, december, he, attended, a, meeting, with, tanzanian, and, ugandan, representatives, to, form, the, east, african, economic, community, reflecting, kenyatta, s, cautious, approach, toward, regional, integration, he, also, took, on, a, mediating, role, during, the, congo, crisis, heading, the, organisation, of, african, unity, s, conciliation, commission, on, the, congo, facing, the, pressures, of, the, cold, war, kenyatta, officially, pursued, a, policy, of, positive, non, alignment, in, reality, his, foreign, policy, was, pro, western, and, in, particular, pro, british, kenya, became, a, member, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, using, this, as, a, vehicle, to, put, pressure, on, the, white, minority, apartheid, regimes, in, south, africa, and, rhodesia, britain, remained, one, of, kenya, s, foremost, sources,

kenyatta, s, government, made, the, british, special, air, service, trained, kenyatta, s, own, bodyguards, commentators, argued, that, britain, s, relationship, with, kenyatta, s, kenya, was, a, neo, colonial, one, with, the, british, having, exchanged, their, position, of, political, power, for, one, of, influence, the, historian, poppy, cullen, nevertheless, noted, that, there, was, no, dictatorial, neo, colonial, control, in, kenyatta, s, kenya, although, many, white, kenyans, accepted, kenyatta, s, rule, he, remained, opposed, by, white, far, right, activists, while, in, london, at, the, july, 1964, commonwealth, conference, he, was, assaulted, by, martin, webster, a, british, neo, nazi, at, the, london, hilton, hotel, kenyatta, s, relationship, with, the, united, states, was, also, warm, the, united, states, agency, for, international, development, played, a, key, role, in, helping, respond, to, a, maize, shortage, in, kambaland, in, 1965, kenyatta, also, maintained, a, warm, relationship, with, israel, including, when, other, east, african, nations, endorsed, arab, hostility, to, the, state, he, for, instance, permitted, israeli, jets, to, refuel, in, kenya, on, their, way, back, from, the, entebbe, raid, in, turn, in, 1976, the, israelis, warned, of, a, plot, by, the, palestinian, liberation, army, to, assassinate, him, a, threat, he, took, seriously, kenyatta, and, his, government, were, anti, communist, and, in, june, 1965, he, warned, that, it, is, naive, to, think, that, there, is, no, danger, of, imperialism, from, the, east, in, world, power, politics, the, east, has, as, much, designs, upon, us, as, the, west, and, would, like, to, serve, their, own, interests, that, is, why, we, reject, communism, his, governance, was, often, criticised, by, communists, and, other, leftists, some, of, whom, accused, him, of, being, a, fascist, when, chinese, communist, official, zhou, enlai, visited, dar, es, salaam, his, statement, that, africa, is, ripe, for, revolution, was, clearly, aimed, largely, at, kenya, in, 1964, kenyatta, impounded, a, secret, shipment, of, chinese, armaments, that, passed, through, kenyan, territory, on, its, way, to, uganda, obote, personally, visited, kenyatta, to, apologise, in, june, 1967, kenyatta, declared, the, chinese, charg, d, affairs, persona, non, grata, in, kenya, and, recalled, the, kenyan, ambassador, from, peking, relations, with, the, soviet, union, were, also, strained, kenyatta, shut, down, the, lumumba, institute, an, educational, organisation, named, after, the, congolese, independence, leader, patrice, lumumba, on, the, basis, that, it, was, a, front, for, soviet, influence, in, kenya, kenyatta, made, clear, his, desire, for, kenya, to, become, a, one, party, state, regarding, this, as, a, better, expression, of, national, unity, than, a, multi, party, system, in, the, first, five, years, of, independence, he, consolidated, control, of, the, central, government, removing, the, autonomy, of, kenya, s, provinces, to, prevent, the, entrenchment, of, ethnic, power, bases, he, argued, that, centralised, control, of, the, government, was, needed, to, deal, with, the, growth, in, demands, for, local, services, and, to, assist, quicker, economic, development, in, 1966, it, launched, a, commission, to, examine, reforms, to, local, government, operations, and, in, 1969, passed, the, transfer, of, functions, act, which, terminated, grants, to, local, authorities, and, transferred, major, services, from, provincial, to, central, control, a, major, focus, for, kenyatta, during, the, first, three, and, a, half, years, of, kenya, s, independence, were, the, divisions, within, kanu, itself, opposition, to, kenyatta, s, government, grew, particularly, following, the, assassination, of, pio, pinto, in, february, 1965, kenyatta, condemned, the, assassination, of, the, prominent, leftist, politician, although, uk, intelligence, agencies, believed, that, his, own, bodyguard, had, orchestrated, the, murder, relations, between, kenyatta, and, odinga, were, strained, and, at, the, march, 1966, party, conference, odinga, s, post, that, of, party, vice, president, was, divided, among, eight, different, politicians, greatly, limiting, his, power, and, ending, his, position, as, kenyatta, s, automatic, successor, between, 1964, and, 1966, kenyatta, and, other, kanu, conservatives, had, been, deliberately, trying, to, push, odinga, to, resign, from, the, party, under, growing, pressure, in, 1966, odinga, stepped, down, as, state, vice, president, claiming, that, kenya, had, failed, to, achieve, economic, independence, and, needed, to, adopt, socialist, policies, backed, by, several, other, senior, kanu, figures, and, trade, unionists, he, became, head, of, the, new, kenya, peoples, union, kpu, in, its, manifesto, the, kpu, stated, that, it, would, pursue, truly, socialist, policies, like, the, nationalisation, of, public, utilities, it, claimed, kenyatta, s, government, want, to, build, a, capitalist, system, in, the, image, of, western, capitalism, but, are, too, embarrassed, or, dishonest, to, call, it, that, the, kpu, were, legally, recognised, as, the, official, opposition, thus, restoring, the, country, s, two, party, system, the, new, party, was, a, direct, challenge, to, kenyatta, s, rule, and, he, regarded, it, as, a, communist, inspired, plot, to, oust, him, soon, after, the, kpu, s, creation, the, kenyan, parliament, amended, the, constitution, to, ensure, that, the, defectors, who, had, originally, been, elected, on, the, kanu, ticket, could, not, automatically, retain, their, seats, and, would, have, to, stand, for, re, election, this, resulted, in, the, election, of, june, 1966, the, luo, increasingly, rallied, around, the, kpu, which, experienced, localized, violence, that, hindered, its, ability, to, campaign, although, kenyatta, s, government, officially, disavowed, this, violence, kanu, retained, the, support, of, all, national, newspapers, and, the, government, owned, radio, and, television, stations, of, the, 29, defectors, only, nine, were, re, elected, on, the, kpu, ticket, odinga, was, among, them, having, retained, his, central, nyanza, seat, with, a, high, majority, odinga, was, replaced, as, vice, president, by, joseph, murumbi, who, in, turn, would, be, replaced, by, moi, in, july, 1969, mboya, a, prominent, and, popular, luo, kanu, politician, was, assassinated, by, a, kikuyu, kenyatta, had, reportedly, been, concerned, that, mboya, with, u, s, backing, could, remove, him, from, the, presidency, and, across, kenya, there, were, suspicions, voiced, that, kenyatta, s, government, was, responsible, for, mboya, s, death, the, killing, sparked, tensions, between, the, kikuyu, and, other, ethnic, groups, across, the, country, with, riots, breaking, out, in, nairobi, in, october, 1969, kenyatta, visited, kisumu, located, in, luo, territory, to, open, a, hospital, on, being, greeted, by, a, crowd, shouting, kpu, slogans, he, lost, his, temper, when, members, of, the, crowd, started, throwing, stones, kenyatta, s, bodyguards, opened, fire, on, them, killing, and, wounding, several, in, response, to, the, rise, of, kpu, kenyatta, had, introduced, oathing, a, kikuyu, cultural, tradition, in, which, individuals, came, to, gatundu, to, swear, their, loyalty, to, him, journalists, were, discouraged, from, reporting, on, the, oathing, system, and, several, were, deported, when, they, tried, to, do, so, many, kenyans, were, pressured, or, forced, to, swear, oaths, something, condemned, by, the, country, s, christian, establishment, in, response, to, the, growing, condemnation, the, oathing, was, terminated, in, september, 1969, and, kenyatta, invited, leaders, from, other, ethnic, groups, to, a, meeting, in, gatundu, kenyatta, s, government, resorted, to, un, democratic, measures, to, restrict, the, opposition, it, used, laws, on, detention, and, deportation, to, perpetuate, its, political, hold, in, 1966, it, passed, the, public, security, detained, and, restricted, persons, regulations, allowing, the, authorities, to, arrest, and, detain, anyone, for, the, preservation, of, public, security, without, putting, them, on, trial, in, october, 1969, the, government, banned, the, kpu, and, arrested, odinga, before, putting, him, under, indefinite, detainment, with, the, organised, opposition, eliminated, from, 1969, kenya, was, once, again, a, de, facto, one, party, state, the, december, 1969, general, election, in, which, all, candidates, were, from, the, ruling, kanu, resulted, in, kenyatta, s, government, remaining, in, power, but, many, members, of, his, government, lost, their, parliamentary, seats, to, rivals, from, within, the, party, over, coming, years, many, other, political, and, intellectual, figures, considered, hostile, to, kenyatta, s, rule, were, detained, or, imprisoned, including, seroney, flomena, chelagat, george, anyona, martin, shikuku, and, ng, g, wa, thiong, o, other, political, figures, who, were, critical, of, kenyatta, s, administration, including, ronald, ngala, and, josiah, mwangi, kariuki, were, killed, in, incidents, that, many, speculated, were, government, assassinations, for, many, years, kenyatta, had, suffered, health, problems, he, had, a, mild, stroke, in, 1966, and, a, second, in, may, 1968, he, suffered, from, gout, and, heart, problems, all, of, which, he, sought, to, keep, hidden, from, the, public, by, 1970, he, was, increasingly, feeble, and, senile, and, by, 1975, kenyatta, had, according, to, maloba, in, effect, ceased, to, actively, govern, four, kikuyu, politicians, koinange, james, gichuru, njoroge, mungai, and, charles, njonjo, formed, his, inner, circle, of, associates, and, he, was, rarely, seen, in, public, without, one, of, them, present, this, clique, faced, opposition, from, kanu, back, benchers, spearheaded, by, josiah, mwangi, kariuki, in, march, 1975, kariuki, was, kidnapped, tortured, and, murdered, and, his, body, was, dumped, in, the, ngong, hills, after, kariuki, s, murder, maloba, noted, there, was, a, noticeable, erosion, of, support, for, kenyatta, and, his, government, thenceforth, when, the, president, spoke, to, crowds, they, no, longer, applauded, his, statements, in, 1977, kenyatta, had, several, further, strokes, or, heart, attacks, on, 22, august, 1978, he, died, of, a, heart, attack, in, the, state, house, mombasa, the, kenyan, government, had, been, preparing, for, kenyatta, s, death, since, at, least, his, 1968, stroke, it, had, requested, british, assistance, in, organising, his, state, funeral, as, a, result, of, the, uk, s, longstanding, experience, in, this, area, mckenzie, had, been, employed, as, a, go, between, and, the, structure, of, the, funeral, was, orchestrated, to, deliberately, imitate, that, of, deceased, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, in, doing, so, senior, kenyans, sought, to, project, an, image, of, their, country, as, a, modern, nation, state, rather, than, one, incumbent, on, tradition, the, funeral, took, place, at, st, andrew, s, presbyterian, church, six, days, after, kenyatta, s, death, britain, s, heir, to, the, throne, charles, prince, of, wales, attended, the, event, a, symbol, of, the, value, that, the, british, government, perceived, in, its, relationship, with, kenya, african, heads, of, state, also, attended, including, nyerere, idi, amin, kenneth, kaunda, and, hastings, banda, as, did, india, s, morarji, desai, and, pakistan, s, muhammad, zia, ul, haq, his, body, was, buried, in, a, mausoleum, in, the, grounds, of, the, parliament, buildings, in, nairobi, kenyatta, s, succession, had, been, an, issue, of, debate, since, independence, and, kenyatta, had, not, unreservedly, nominated, a, successor, the, kikuyu, clique, surrounding, him, had, sought, to, amend, the, constitution, to, prevent, vice, president, moi, who, was, from, the, kalenjin, people, rather, than, the, kikuyu, from, automatically, becoming, acting, president, but, their, attempts, failed, amid, sustained, popular, and, parliamentary, opposition, after, kenyatta, s, death, the, transition, of, power, proved, smooth, surprising, many, international, commentators, as, vice, president, moi, was, sworn, in, as, acting, president, for, a, 90, day, interim, period, in, october, he, was, unanimously, elected, kanu, president, and, subsequently, declared, president, of, kenya, itself, moi, emphasised, his, loyalty, to, kenyatta, i, followed, and, was, faithful, to, him, until, his, last, day, even, when, his, closest, friends, forsook, him, and, there, was, much, expectation, that, he, would, continue, the, policies, inaugurated, by, kenyatta, he, nevertheless, criticised, the, corruption, land, grabbing, and, capitalistic, ethos, that, had, characterised, kenyatta, s, period, and, expressed, populist, tendencies, by, emphasizing, a, closer, link, to, the, poor, in, 1982, he, would, amend, the, kenyan, constitution, to, create, a, de, jure, one, party, state, kenyatta, possessed, the, common, touch, and, great, leadership, qualities, he, was, essentially, a, moderate, trying, to, achieve, the, radical, revolution, of, a, nationalist, victory, in, a, colonialist, society, and, his, ambivalence, over, many, issues, can, best, be, explained, by, his, need, to, contain, or, use, his, militants, and, he, had, plenty, of, them, they, were, impatient, and, wanted, to, see, effective, action, kenyatta, certainly, knew, how, to, appeal, to, african, sentiments, kenyatta, biographer, guy, arnold, kenyatta, was, an, african, nationalist, and, was, committed, to, the, belief, that, european, colonial, rule, in, africa, must, end, like, other, anti, colonialists, he, believed, that, under, colonialism, the, human, and, natural, resources, of, africa, had, been, used, not, for, the, benefit, of, africa, s, population, but, for, the, enrichment, of, the, colonisers, and, their, european, homelands, for, kenyatta, independence, meant, not, just, self, rule, but, an, end, to, the, colour, bar, and, to, the, patronising, attitudes, and, racist, slang, of, kenya, s, white, minority, according, to, murray, brown, kenyatta, s, basic, philosophy, throughout, his, life, was, that, all, men, deserved, the, right, to, develop, peacefully, according, to, their, own, wishes, kenyatta, expressed, this, in, his, statement, that, i, have, stood, always, for, the, purposes, of, human, dignity, in, freedom, and, for, the, values, of, tolerance, and, peace, this, approach, was, similar, to, the, zambian, president, kenneth, kaunda, s, ideology, of, african, humanism, murray, brown, noted, that, kenyatta, had, always, kept, himself, free, from, ideological, commitments, while, the, historian, william, r, ochieng, observed, that, kenyatta, articulated, no, particular, social, philosophy, similarly, assensoh, noted, that, kenyatta, was, not, interested, in, social, philosophies, and, slogans, several, commentators, and, biographers, described, him, as, being, politically, conservative, an, ideological, viewpoint, likely, bolstered, by, his, training, in, functionalist, anthropology, he, pursued, according, to, maloba, a, conservatism, that, worked, in, concert, with, imperial, powers, and, was, distinctly, hostile, to, radical, politics, kenyatta, biographer, guy, arnold, described, the, kenyan, leader, as, a, pragmatist, and, a, moderate, noting, that, his, only, radicalism, came, in, the, form, of, his, nationalist, attack, on, imperialism, arnold, also, noted, that, kenyatta, absorbed, a, great, deal, of, the, british, approach, to, politics, pragmatism, only, dealing, with, problems, when, they, become, crises, tolerance, as, long, as, the, other, side, is, only, talking, donald, savage, noted, that, kenyatta, believed, in, the, importance, of, authority, and, tradition, and, that, he, displayed, a, remarkably, consistent, view, of, development, through, self, help, and, hard, work, kenyatta, was, also, an, elitist, and, encouraged, the, emergence, of, an, elite, class, in, kenya, he, wrestled, with, a, contradiction, between, his, conservative, desire, for, a, renewal, of, traditional, custom, and, his, reformist, urges, to, embrace, western, modernity, he, also, faced, a, contradiction, between, his, internal, debates, on, kikuyu, ethics, and, belief, in, tribal, identity, with, his, need, to, create, a, non, tribalised, kenyan, nationalism, while, in, britain, kenyatta, made, political, alliances, with, individuals, committed, to, marxism, and, to, radical, pan, africanism, the, idea, that, african, countries, should, politically, unify, some, commentators, have, posthumously, characterised, kenyatta, as, a, pan, africanist, maloba, observed, that, during, the, colonial, period, kenyatta, had, embraced, radical, pan, african, activism, which, differed, sharply, from, the, deliberate, conservative, positions, especially, on, the, question, of, african, liberation, that, he, espoused, while, kenya, s, leader, as, leader, of, kenya, kenyatta, published, two, collected, volumes, of, his, speeches, harambee, and, suffering, without, bitterness, the, material, included, in, these, publications, was, carefully, selected, so, as, to, avoid, mention, of, the, radicalism, he, exhibited, while, in, britain, during, the, 1930s, kenyatta, had, been, exposed, to, marxist, leninist, ideas, through, his, friendship, with, padmore, and, the, time, spent, in, the, soviet, union, but, had, also, been, exposed, to, western, forms, of, liberal, democratic, government, through, his, many, years, in, britain, he, appears, to, have, had, no, further, involvement, with, the, communist, movement, after, 1934, as, kenya, s, leader, kenyatta, rejected, the, idea, that, marxism, offered, a, useful, framework, for, analysing, his, country, s, socio, economic, situation, the, academics, bruce, j, berman, and, john, m, lonsdale, argued, that, marxist, frameworks, for, analysing, society, influenced, some, of, his, beliefs, such, as, his, view, that, british, colonialism, had, to, be, destroyed, rather, than, simply, reformed, kenyatta, nevertheless, disagreed, with, the, marxist, attitude, that, tribalism, was, backward, and, retrograde, his, positive, attitude, toward, tribal, society, frustrated, some, of, kenyatta, s, marxist, pan, africanist, friends, in, britain, among, them, padmore, james, and, t, ras, makonnen, who, regarded, it, as, parochial, and, un, progressive, assensoh, suggested, that, kenyatta, initially, had, socialist, inclinations, but, became, a, victim, of, capitalist, circumstances, conversely, savage, stated, that, kenyatta, s, direction, was, hardly, towards, the, creation, of, a, radical, new, socialist, society, and, ochieng, called, him, an, african, capitalist, when, in, power, kenyatta, displayed, a, preoccupation, with, individual, and, mbari, land, rights, that, were, at, odds, with, any, socialist, oriented, collectivisation, according, to, maloba, kenyatta, s, government, sought, to, project, capitalism, as, an, african, ideology, and, communism, or, socialism, as, alien, and, dangerous, ever, a, showman, could, appear, one, moment, in, gaily, coloured, shirts, decorated, with, the, cock, of, kanu, and, the, next, in, elegant, suits, from, savile, row, seldom, without, a, rose, in, his, buttonhole, he, could, be, photographed, in, leopard, skin, hat, and, cloak, waving, a, silver, fly, whisk, or, in, old, slacks, on, his, farm, tending, his, shrubs, he, was, equally, at, home, in, academic, robes, at, a, university, function, and, in, sandals, and, shorts, on, the, beach, at, mombasa, african, exuberance, and, love, of, display, found, perfect, expression, in, kenyatta, s, flair, alongside, the, dignity, and, respect, due, to, his, excellency, the, president, mzee, jomo, kenyatta, kenyatta, biographer, jeremy, murray, brown, kenyatta, was, a, flamboyant, character, with, an, extroverted, personality, according, to, murray, brown, he, liked, being, at, the, centre, of, life, and, was, always, a, rebel, at, heart, who, enjoyed, earthly, pleasures, one, of, kenyatta, s, fellow, lse, students, elspeth, huxley, referred, to, him, as, a, showman, to, his, finger, tips, jovial, a, good, companion, shrewd, fluent, quick, devious, subtle, flesh, pot, loving, kenyatta, liked, to, dress, elaborately, throughout, most, of, his, adult, life, he, wore, finger, rings, and, while, studying, at, university, in, london, took, to, wearing, a, fez, and, cloak, and, carrying, a, silver, topped, black, cane, he, adopted, his, surname, kenyatta, after, the, name, of, a, beaded, belt, he, often, wore, in, early, life, as, president, he, collected, a, variety, of, expensive, cars, murray, brown, noted, that, kenyatta, had, the, ability, to, appear, all, things, to, all, men, also, displaying, a, consummate, ability, to, keep, his, true, purposes, and, abilities, to, himself, for, instance, concealing, his, connections, with, communists, and, the, soviet, union, both, from, members, of, the, british, labour, party, and, from, kikuyu, figures, at, home, this, deviousness, was, sometimes, interpreted, as, dishonesty, by, those, who, met, him, referring, to, kenyatta, s, appearance, in, 1920s, kenya, murray, brown, stated, the, leader, presented, himself, to, europeans, as, an, agreeable, if, somewhat, seedy, europeanized, native, and, to, indigenous, africans, as, a, sophisticated, man, about, town, about, whose, political, earnestness, they, had, certain, reservations, simon, gikandi, argued, that, kenyatta, like, some, of, his, contemporaries, in, the, pan, african, movement, was, an, afro, victorian, someone, whose, identity, had, been, shaped, by, the, culture, of, colonialism, and, colonial, institutions, especially, those, of, the, victorian, era, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, kenyatta, cultivated, the, image, of, a, colonial, gentleman, in, england, he, displayed, pleasant, manners, and, a, flexible, attitude, in, adapting, to, urban, situations, dissimilar, to, the, lands, he, had, grown, up, in, a, r, barlow, a, member, of, the, church, of, scotland, mission, at, kikuyu, met, with, kenyatta, in, britain, later, relating, that, he, was, impressed, by, how, kenyatta, could, mix, on, equal, terms, with, europeans, and, to, hold, his, end, up, in, spite, of, his, handicaps, educationally, and, socially, the, south, african, peter, abrahams, met, kenyatta, in, london, noting, that, of, all, the, black, men, involved, in, the, city, s, pan, africanist, movement, he, was, the, most, relaxed, sophisticated, and, westernized, of, the, lot, of, us, as, president, kenyatta, often, reminisced, nostalgically, about, his, time, in, england, referring, to, it, as, home, on, several, occasions, berman, and, lonsdale, described, his, life, as, being, preoccupied, with, a, search, for, the, reconciliation, of, the, western, modernity, he, embraced, and, an, equally, valued, kikuyuness, he, could, not, discard, gikandi, argued, that, kenyatta, s, identification, with, englishness, was, much, more, profound, than, both, his, friends, and, enemies, have, been, willing, to, admit, kenyatta, has, also, been, described, as, a, talented, orator, author, and, editor, he, had, dictatorial, and, autocratic, tendencies, as, well, as, a, fierce, temper, that, could, emerge, as, rage, on, occasion, murray, brown, noted, that, kenyatta, could, be, quite, unscrupulous, even, brutal, in, using, others, to, get, what, he, wanted, but, he, never, displayed, any, physical, cruelty, or, nihilism, kenyatta, had, no, racist, impulses, regarding, white, europeans, as, can, for, instance, be, seen, through, his, marriage, to, a, white, english, woman, he, told, his, daughter, the, english, are, wonderful, people, to, live, with, in, england, he, welcomed, white, support, for, his, cause, so, long, as, it, was, generous, and, unconditional, and, spoke, of, a, kenya, in, which, indigenous, africans, europeans, arabs, and, indians, could, all, regard, themselves, as, kenyans, working, and, living, alongside, each, other, peacefully, despite, this, kenyatta, exhibited, a, general, dislike, of, indians, believing, that, they, exploited, indigenous, africans, in, kenya, i, do, not, think, i, am, and, have, never, been, an, enemy, of, europeans, or, the, white, people, because, i, have, spent, many, years, in, england, or, in, europe, and, even, today, i, have, many, friends, in, various, nations, kenyatta, april, 1961, kenyatta, was, a, polygamist, he, viewed, monogamy, through, an, anthropological, lens, as, an, interesting, western, phenomenon, but, did, not, adopt, the, practice, himself, instead, having, sexual, relations, with, a, wide, range, of, women, throughout, his, life, murray, brown, characterized, kenyatta, as, an, affectionate, father, to, his, children, but, one, who, was, frequently, absent, kenyatta, had, two, children, from, his, first, marriage, with, grace, wahu, son, peter, muigai, kenyatta, born, 1920, who, later, became, a, deputy, minister, and, daughter, margaret, kenyatta, born, 1928, margaret, served, as, mayor, of, nairobi, between, 1970, and, 1976, and, then, as, kenya, s, ambassador, to, the, united, nations, from, 1976, to, 1986, of, these, children, it, was, margaret, who, was, kenyatta, s, closest, confidante, during, his, trial, kenyatta, described, himself, as, a, christian, saying, i, do, not, follow, any, particular, denomination, i, believe, in, christianity, as, a, whole, arnold, stated, that, in, england, kenyatta, s, adherence, to, christianity, was, desultory, while, in, london, kenyatta, had, taken, an, interest, in, the, atheist, speakers, at, speakers, corner, in, hyde, park, while, an, irish, muslim, friend, had, unsuccessfully, urged, kenyatta, to, convert, to, islam, during, his, imprisonment, kenyatta, read, up, on, islam, hinduism, buddhism, and, confucianism, through, books, supplied, to, him, by, stock, the, israeli, diplomat, asher, naim, visited, him, in, this, period, noting, that, although, kenyatta, was, not, a, religious, man, he, was, appreciative, of, the, bible, despite, portraying, himself, as, a, christian, he, found, the, attitudes, of, many, european, missionaries, intolerable, in, particular, their, readiness, to, see, everything, african, as, evil, in, facing, mount, kenya, he, challenged, the, missionaries, dismissive, attitude, toward, ancestor, veneration, which, he, instead, preferred, to, call, ancestor, communion, in, that, book, s, dedication, kenyatta, invoked, ancestral, spirits, as, part, of, the, fight, for, african, freedom, within, kenya, kenyatta, came, to, be, regarded, as, the, father, of, the, nation, and, was, given, the, unofficial, title, of, mzee, a, swahili, term, meaning, grand, old, man, from, 1963, until, his, death, a, cult, of, personality, surrounded, him, in, the, country, one, which, deliberately, interlinked, kenyan, nationalism, with, kenyatta, s, own, personality, this, use, of, kenyatta, as, a, popular, symbol, of, the, nation, itself, was, furthered, by, the, similarities, between, their, names, he, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, father, figure, not, only, by, kikuyu, and, kenyans, but, by, africans, more, widely, after, 1963, maloba, noted, kenyatta, became, about, the, most, admired, post, independence, african, leader, on, the, world, stage, one, who, western, countries, hailed, as, a, beloved, elder, statesman, his, opinions, were, most, valued, both, by, conservative, african, politicians, and, by, western, leaders, on, becoming, kenya, s, leader, his, anti, communist, positions, gained, favour, in, the, west, and, some, pro, western, governments, gave, him, awards, in, 1965, he, for, instance, received, medals, from, both, pope, paul, vi, and, from, the, south, korean, government, in, 1974, arnold, referred, to, kenyatta, as, one, of, the, outstanding, african, leaders, now, living, someone, who, had, become, synonymous, with, kenya, he, added, that, kenyatta, had, been, one, of, the, shrewdest, politicians, on, the, continent, regarded, as, one, of, the, great, architects, of, african, nationalist, achievement, since, 1945, kenneth, o, nyangena, characterised, him, as, one, of, the, greatest, men, of, the, twentieth, century, having, been, a, beacon, a, rallying, point, for, suffering, kenyans, to, fight, for, their, rights, justice, and, freedom, whose, brilliance, gave, strength, and, aspiration, to, people, beyond, the, boundaries, of, kenya, in, 2018, maloba, described, him, as, one, of, the, legendary, pioneers, of, modern, african, nationalism, in, their, examination, of, his, writings, berman, and, lonsdale, described, him, as, a, pioneer, for, being, one, of, the, first, kikuyu, to, write, and, publish, his, representational, achievement, was, unique, maxon, noted, that, in, the, areas, of, health, and, education, kenya, under, kenyatta, achieved, more, in, a, decade, and, a, half, than, the, colonial, state, had, accomplished, in, the, preceding, six, decades, by, the, time, of, kenyatta, s, death, kenya, had, gained, higher, life, expectancy, rates, than, most, of, sub, saharan, africa, there, had, been, an, expansion, in, primary, secondary, and, higher, education, and, the, country, had, taken, what, maxon, called, giant, steps, toward, achieving, its, goal, of, universal, primary, education, for, kenyan, children, another, significant, success, had, been, in, dismantling, the, colonial, era, system, of, racial, segregation, in, schools, public, facilities, and, social, clubs, peacefully, and, with, minimal, disruption, during, much, of, his, life, kenya, s, white, settlers, had, regarded, kenyatta, as, a, malcontent, and, an, agitator, for, them, he, was, a, figure, of, hatred, and, fear, as, noted, by, arnold, no, figure, in, the, whole, of, british, africa, with, the, possible, exception, of, excited, among, the, settlers, and, the, colonial, authorities, alike, so, many, expressions, of, anger, denigration, and, fury, as, did, kenyatta, as, the, historian, keith, kyle, put, it, for, many, whites, kenyatta, was, satan, incarnate, this, white, animosity, reached, its, apogee, between, 1950, and, 1952, by, 1964, this, image, had, largely, shifted, and, many, white, settlers, referred, to, him, as, good, old, mzee, murray, brown, expressed, the, view, that, for, many, kenyatta, s, message, of, reconciliation, to, forgive, and, forget, was, perhaps, his, greatest, contribution, to, his, country, and, to, history, to, ochieng, kenyatta, was, a, personification, of, conservative, social, forces, and, tendencies, in, kenya, towards, the, end, of, his, presidency, many, younger, kenyans, while, respecting, kenyatta, s, role, in, attaining, independence, regarded, him, as, a, reactionary, those, desiring, a, radical, transformation, of, kenyan, society, often, compared, kenyatta, s, kenya, unfavourably, with, its, southern, neighbour, julius, nyerere, s, tanzania, the, criticisms, that, leftists, like, odinga, made, of, kenyatta, s, leadership, were, similar, to, those, that, the, intellectual, frantz, fanon, had, made, of, post, colonial, leaders, throughout, africa, drawing, upon, marxist, theory, jay, o, brien, for, instance, argued, that, kenyatta, had, come, to, power, as, a, representative, of, a, would, be, bourgeoisie, a, coalition, of, relatively, privileged, petty, bourgeois, african, elements, who, wanted, simply, to, replace, the, british, colonialists, and, asian, commercial, bourgeoisie, with, themselves, he, suggested, that, the, british, supported, kenyatta, in, this, seeing, him, as, a, bulwark, against, growing, worker, and, peasant, militancy, who, would, ensure, continued, neo, colonial, dominance, providing, a, similar, leftist, critique, the, marxist, writer, ng, g, wa, thiong, o, stated, that, here, was, a, black, moses, who, had, been, called, by, history, to, lead, his, people, to, the, promised, land, of, no, exploitation, no, oppression, but, who, failed, to, rise, to, the, occasion, ng, g, saw, kenyatta, as, a, twentieth, century, tragic, figure, he, could, have, been, a, lenin, a, mao, zedong, or, a, ho, chi, minh, but, he, ended, up, being, a, chiang, kai, shek, a, park, chung, hee, or, a, pinochet, ng, g, was, among, kenyan, critics, who, claimed, that, kenyatta, treated, mau, mau, veterans, dismissively, leaving, many, of, them, impoverished, and, landless, while, seeking, to, remove, them, from, the, centre, stage, of, national, politics, in, other, areas, kenyatta, s, government, also, faced, criticism, it, for, instance, made, little, progress, in, advancing, women, s, rights, in, kenya, assensoh, argued, that, in, his, life, story, kenyatta, had, a, great, deal, in, common, with, ghana, s, kwame, nkrumah, simon, gikandi, noted, that, kenyatta, like, nkrumah, was, remembered, for, initiating, the, discourse, and, process, that, plotted, the, narrative, of, african, freedom, but, at, the, same, time, both, were, often, remembered, for, their, careless, institution, of, presidential, rule, one, party, dictatorship, ethnicity, and, cronyism, they, are, remembered, both, for, making, the, dream, of, african, independence, a, reality, and, for, their, invention, of, postcolonial, authoritarianism, in, 1991, the, kenyan, lawyer, and, human, rights, activist, gibson, kamau, kuria, noted, that, in, abolishing, the, federal, system, banning, independent, candidates, from, standing, in, elections, setting, up, a, unicameral, legislature, and, relaxing, restrictions, on, the, use, of, emergency, powers, kenyatta, had, laid, the, groundwork, for, moi, to, further, advance, dictatorial, power, in, kenya, during, the, late, 1970s, and, 1980s, in, its, 2013, report, the, truth, justice, and, reconciliation, commission, of, kenya, accused, kenyatta, of, using, his, authority, as, president, to, allocate, large, tracts, of, land, to, himself, and, his, family, across, kenya, the, kenyatta, family, is, among, kenya, s, biggest, landowners, during, the, 1990s, there, was, still, much, frustration, among, tribal, groups, namely, in, the, nandi, nakuru, uasin, gishu, and, trans, nzoia, districts, where, under, kenyatta, s, government, they, had, not, regained, the, land, taken, by, european, settlers, and, more, of, it, had, been, sold, to, those, regarded, as, foreigners, kenyans, from, other, tribes, among, these, groups, there, were, widespread, calls, for, restitution, and, in, 1991, and, 1992, there, were, violent, attacks, against, many, of, those, who, obtained, land, through, kenyatta, s, patronage, in, these, areas, the, violence, continued, sporadically, until, 1996, with, an, estimated, 1500, killed, and, 300, 000, displaced, in, the, rift, valley
