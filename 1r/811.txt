cesare, bonesana, di, beccaria, marquis, of, gualdrasco, and, villareggio, italian, 15, march, 1738, 28, november, 1794, was, an, italian, criminologist, jurist, philosopher, economist, and, politician, who, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, greatest, thinkers, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, he, is, well, remembered, for, his, treatise, on, crimes, and, punishments, 1764, which, condemned, torture, and, the, death, penalty, and, was, a, founding, work, in, the, field, of, penology, and, the, classical, school, of, criminology, beccaria, is, considered, the, father, of, modern, criminal, law, and, the, father, of, criminal, justice, according, to, john, bessler, beccaria, s, works, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, beccaria, was, born, in, milan, on, 15, march, 1738, to, the, marchese, gian, beccaria, bonesana, an, aristocrat, of, moderate, standing, from, the, austrian, habsburg, empire, beccaria, received, his, early, education, in, the, jesuit, college, at, parma, subsequently, he, graduated, in, law, from, the, university, of, pavia, in, 1758, at, first, he, showed, a, great, aptitude, for, mathematics, but, studying, montesquieu, 1689, 1755, redirected, his, attention, towards, economics, in, 1762, his, first, publication, a, tract, on, the, disorder, of, the, currency, in, the, milanese, states, included, a, proposal, for, its, remedy, in, his, mid, twenties, beccaria, became, close, friends, with, pietro, and, alessandro, verri, two, brothers, who, with, a, number, of, other, young, men, from, the, milan, aristocracy, formed, a, literary, society, named, l, accademia, dei, pugni, the, academy, of, fists, a, playful, name, which, made, fun, of, the, stuffy, academies, that, proliferated, in, italy, and, also, hinted, that, relaxed, conversations, which, took, place, in, there, sometimes, ended, in, affrays, much, of, its, discussion, focused, on, reforming, the, criminal, justice, system, through, this, group, beccaria, became, acquainted, with, french, and, british, political, philosophers, such, as, diderot, helv, tius, montesquieu, and, hume, he, was, particularly, influenced, by, helv, tius, cesare, beccaria, was, best, known, for, his, book, on, crimes, and, punishments, in, 1764, with, the, encouragement, of, pietro, verri, beccaria, published, a, brief, but, celebrated, treatise, on, crimes, and, punishments, some, background, information, was, provided, by, pietro, who, was, writing, a, text, on, the, history, of, torture, and, alessandro, verri, a, milan, prison, official, who, had, firsthand, experience, of, the, prison, s, appalling, conditions, in, this, essay, beccaria, reflected, the, convictions, of, his, friends, in, the, il, caff, coffee, house, group, who, sought, reform, through, enlightenment, discourse, beccaria, s, treatise, marked, the, high, point, of, the, milan, enlightenment, in, it, beccaria, put, forth, some, of, the, first, modern, arguments, against, the, death, penalty, his, treatise, was, also, the, first, full, work, of, penology, advocating, reform, of, the, criminal, law, system, the, book, was, the, first, full, scale, work, to, tackle, criminal, reform, and, to, suggest, that, criminal, justice, should, conform, to, rational, principles, it, is, a, less, theoretical, work, than, the, writings, of, hugo, grotius, samuel, von, pufendorf, and, other, comparable, thinkers, and, as, much, a, work, of, advocacy, as, of, theory, the, brief, work, relentlessly, protests, against, torture, to, obtain, confessions, secret, accusations, the, arbitrary, discretionary, power, of, judges, the, inconsistency, and, inequality, of, sentencing, using, personal, connections, to, get, a, lighter, sentence, and, the, use, of, capital, punishment, for, serious, and, even, minor, offences, almost, immediately, the, work, was, translated, into, french, and, english, and, went, through, several, editions, editions, of, beccaria, s, text, follow, two, distinct, arrangements, of, the, material, that, by, beccaria, himself, and, that, by, french, translator, andr, morellet, 1765, who, imposed, a, more, systematic, order, morellet, felt, the, italian, text, required, clarification, and, therefore, omitted, parts, made, some, additions, and, above, all, restructured, the, essay, by, moving, merging, or, splitting, chapters, because, beccaria, indicated, in, a, letter, to, morellet, that, he, fully, agreed, with, him, scholars, assumed, that, these, adaptations, also, had, beccaria, s, consent, in, substance, the, differences, are, so, great, however, that, morellet, s, version, became, quite, another, book, than, the, book, that, beccaria, wrote, beccaria, opens, his, work, describing, the, great, need, for, reform, in, the, criminal, justice, system, and, he, observes, how, few, studies, there, are, on, the, subject, of, such, reform, throughout, his, work, beccaria, develops, his, position, by, appealing, to, two, key, philosophical, theories, social, contract, and, utility, concerning, the, social, contract, beccaria, argues, that, punishment, is, justified, only, to, defend, the, social, contract, and, to, ensure, that, everyone, will, be, motivated, to, abide, by, it, concerning, utility, perhaps, influenced, by, helvetius, beccaria, argues, that, the, method, of, punishment, selected, should, be, that, which, serves, the, greatest, public, good, contemporary, political, philosophers, distinguish, between, two, principal, theories, of, justifying, punishment, first, the, retributive, approach, maintains, that, punishment, should, be, equal, to, the, harm, done, either, literally, an, eye, for, an, eye, or, more, figuratively, which, allows, for, alternative, forms, of, compensation, the, retributive, approach, tends, to, be, retaliatory, and, vengeance, oriented, the, second, approach, is, utilitarian, which, maintains, that, punishment, should, increase, the, total, amount, of, happiness, in, the, world, this, often, involves, punishment, as, a, means, of, reforming, the, criminal, incapacitating, him, from, repeating, his, crime, and, deterring, others, beccaria, clearly, takes, a, utilitarian, stance, for, beccaria, the, purpose, of, punishment, is, to, create, a, better, society, not, revenge, punishment, serves, to, deter, others, from, committing, crimes, and, to, prevent, the, criminal, from, repeating, his, crime, beccaria, argues, that, punishment, should, be, close, in, time, to, the, criminal, action, to, maximize, the, punishment, s, deterrence, value, he, defends, his, view, about, the, temporal, proximity, of, punishment, by, appealing, to, the, associative, theory, of, understanding, in, which, our, notions, of, causes, and, the, subsequently, perceived, effects, are, a, product, of, our, perceived, emotions, that, form, from, our, observations, of, a, causes, and, effect, occurring, in, close, correspondence, for, more, on, this, topic, see, david, hume, s, work, on, the, problem, of, induction, as, well, as, the, works, of, david, hartley, thus, by, avoiding, punishments, that, are, remote, in, time, from, the, criminal, action, we, are, able, to, strengthen, the, association, between, the, criminal, behavior, and, the, resulting, punishment, which, in, turn, discourages, the, criminal, activity, for, beccaria, when, a, punishment, quickly, follows, a, crime, then, the, two, ideas, of, crime, and, punishment, will, be, more, closely, associated, in, a, person, s, mind, also, the, link, between, a, crime, and, a, punishment, is, stronger, if, the, punishment, is, somehow, related, to, the, crime, given, the, fact, that, the, swiftness, of, punishment, has, the, greatest, impact, on, deterring, others, beccaria, argues, that, there, is, no, justification, for, severe, punishments, in, time, we, will, naturally, grow, accustomed, to, increases, in, severity, of, punishment, and, thus, the, initial, increase, in, severity, will, lose, its, effect, there, are, limits, both, to, how, much, torment, we, can, endure, and, also, how, much, we, can, inflict, beccaria, touches, on, an, array, of, criminal, justice, practices, recommending, reform, for, example, he, argues, that, dueling, can, be, eliminated, if, laws, protected, a, person, from, insults, to, his, honor, laws, against, suicide, are, ineffective, and, thus, should, be, eliminated, leaving, punishment, of, suicide, to, god, bounty, hunting, should, not, be, permitted, since, it, incites, people, to, be, immoral, and, shows, a, weakness, in, the, government, he, argues, that, laws, should, be, clear, in, defining, crimes, so, that, judges, do, not, interpret, the, law, but, only, decide, whether, a, law, has, been, broken, punishments, should, be, in, degree, to, the, severity, of, the, crime, treason, is, the, worst, crime, since, it, harms, the, social, contract, this, is, followed, by, violence, against, a, person, or, his, property, and, finally, by, public, disruption, crimes, against, property, should, be, punished, by, fines, the, best, ways, to, prevent, crimes, are, to, enact, clear, and, simple, laws, reward, virtue, and, improve, education, three, tenets, served, as, the, basis, of, beccaria, s, theories, on, criminal, justice, free, will, rational, manner, and, manipulability, according, to, beccaria, and, most, classical, theorists, free, will, enables, people, to, make, choices, beccaria, believed, that, people, have, a, rational, manner, and, apply, it, toward, making, choices, that, will, help, them, achieve, their, own, personal, gratification, in, beccaria, s, interpretation, law, exists, to, preserve, the, social, contract, and, benefit, society, as, a, whole, but, because, people, act, out, of, self, interest, and, their, interest, sometimes, conflicts, with, societal, laws, they, commit, crimes, the, principle, of, manipulability, refers, to, the, predictable, ways, in, which, people, act, out, of, rational, self, interest, and, might, therefore, be, dissuaded, from, committing, crimes, if, the, punishment, outweighs, the, benefits, of, the, crime, rendering, the, crime, an, illogical, choice, the, principles, to, which, beccaria, appealed, were, reason, an, understanding, of, the, state, as, a, form, of, contract, and, above, all, the, principle, of, utility, or, of, the, greatest, happiness, for, the, greatest, number, beccaria, had, elaborated, this, original, principle, in, conjunction, with, pietro, verri, and, greatly, influenced, jeremy, bentham, to, develop, it, into, the, full, scale, doctrine, of, utilitarianism, he, openly, condemned, the, death, penalty, on, two, grounds, beccaria, developed, in, his, treatise, a, number, of, innovative, and, influential, principles, he, also, argued, against, gun, control, laws, and, was, among, the, first, to, advocate, the, beneficial, influence, of, education, in, lessening, crime, referring, to, gun, control, laws, as, laws, based, on, false, ideas, of, utility, beccaria, wrote, the, laws, of, this, nature, are, those, which, forbid, to, wear, arms, disarming, those, only, who, are, not, disposed, to, commit, the, crime, which, the, laws, mean, to, prevent, he, further, wrote, certainly, makes, the, situation, of, the, assaulted, worse, and, of, the, assailants, better, and, rather, encourages, than, prevents, murder, as, it, requires, less, courage, to, attack, unarmed, than, armed, persons, thomas, jefferson, noted, this, passage, in, his, legal, commonplace, book, as, beccaria, s, ideas, were, critical, of, the, legal, system, in, place, at, the, time, and, were, therefore, likely, to, stir, controversy, he, chose, to, publish, the, essay, anonymously, for, fear, of, government, backlash, among, his, contemporary, critics, was, antonio, silla, writing, from, naples, in, the, event, the, treatise, was, extremely, well, received, catherine, the, great, publicly, endorsed, it, while, thousands, of, miles, away, in, the, united, states, founding, fathers, thomas, jefferson, and, john, adams, quoted, it, once, it, was, clear, that, the, government, approved, of, his, essay, beccaria, republished, it, this, time, crediting, himself, as, the, author, with, much, hesitation, beccaria, accepted, an, invitation, to, paris, to, meet, the, great, thinkers, of, the, day, he, travelled, with, the, verri, brothers, and, was, given, a, warm, reception, by, the, philosophes, however, the, chronically, shy, beccaria, made, a, poor, impression, and, left, after, three, weeks, returning, to, milan, and, to, his, young, wife, teresa, and, never, venturing, abroad, again, the, break, with, the, verri, brothers, proved, lasting, they, were, never, able, to, understand, why, beccaria, had, left, his, position, at, the, peak, of, success, beccaria, nevertheless, continued, to, command, official, recognition, and, he, was, appointed, to, several, nominal, political, positions, in, italy, separated, from, the, invaluable, input, of, his, friends, he, failed, to, produce, another, text, of, equal, importance, outside, italy, an, unfounded, myth, grew, that, beccaria, s, literary, silence, resulted, from, austrian, restrictions, on, free, expression, in, italy, in, fact, prone, to, periodic, bouts, of, depression, and, misanthropy, he, had, grown, silent, on, his, own, legal, scholars, of, the, time, hailed, beccaria, s, treatise, and, several, european, emperors, were, willing, to, follow, it, many, reforms, in, the, penal, codes, of, the, principal, european, nations, can, be, traced, to, the, treatise, but, few, contemporaries, were, convinced, by, beccaria, s, argument, against, the, death, penalty, even, when, the, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, abolished, the, death, penalty, the, first, nation, in, the, world, to, do, so, it, followed, beccaria, s, argument, about, the, lack, of, utility, of, capital, punishment, not, about, the, state, s, lacking, the, right, to, execute, citizens, in, the, anglophone, world, beccaria, s, ideas, fed, into, the, writings, on, punishment, of, sir, william, blackstone, selectively, and, more, wholeheartedly, those, of, william, eden, and, jeremy, bentham, in, november, 1768, he, was, appointed, to, the, chair, of, law, and, economy, founded, expressly, for, him, at, the, palatine, college, of, milan, his, lectures, on, political, economy, which, are, based, on, strict, utilitarian, principles, are, in, marked, accordance, with, the, theories, of, the, english, school, of, economists, they, are, published, in, the, collection, of, italian, writers, on, political, economy, scrittori, classici, italiani, di, economia, politica, vols, xi, and, xii, beccaria, never, succeeded, in, producing, another, work, to, match, dei, delitti, e, delle, pene, but, he, made, various, incomplete, attempts, in, the, course, of, his, life, a, short, treatise, on, literary, style, was, all, he, saw, to, press, in, 1771, beccaria, was, made, a, member, of, the, supreme, economic, council, and, in, 1791, he, was, appointed, to, the, board, for, the, reform, of, the, judicial, code, where, he, made, a, valuable, contribution, during, this, period, he, spearheaded, a, number, of, important, reforms, such, as, the, standardisation, of, weights, and, measurements, he, died, in, milan, a, pioneer, in, criminology, his, influence, during, his, lifetime, extended, to, shaping, the, rights, listed, in, the, us, constitution, and, bill, of, rights, on, crimes, and, punishments, served, as, a, useful, guide, to, the, founding, fathers, beccaria, s, theories, as, expressed, in, on, crimes, and, punishments, have, continued, to, play, a, great, role, in, recent, times, some, of, the, current, policies, impacted, by, his, theories, are, truth, in, sentencing, swift, punishment, and, the, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, in, dozens, of, countries, while, many, of, his, theories, are, popular, some, are, still, a, source, of, heated, controversy, even, more, than, two, centuries, after, the, famed, criminologist, s, death, beccaria, s, grandson, was, alessandro, manzoni, the, noted, italian, novelist, and, poet, who, wrote, among, other, things, the, betrothed, one, of, the, first, italian, historical, novels, and, il, cinque, maggio, a, poem, on, napoleon, s, death
