labour, naismith, spent, his, days, outside, playing, catch, hide, and, seek, or, duck, on, a, rock, a, medieval, game, in, which, a, person, guards, a, large, drake, stone, from, opposing, players, who, try, to, knock, it, down, by, throwing, smaller, stones, at, it, to, play, duck, on, a, rock, most, effectively, naismith, soon, found, that, a, soft, lobbing, shot, was, far, more, effective, than, a, straight, hard, throw, a, thought, that, later, proved, essential, for, the, invention, of, basketball, orphaned, early, in, his, life, naismith, lived, with, his, aunt, and, uncle, for, many, years, and, attended, grade, school, at, bennies, corners, near, almonte, then, he, enrolled, in, almonte, high, school, in, almonte, ontario, from, which, he, graduated, in, 1883, in, the,

1888, to, 1890, naismith, taught, physical, education, and, became, the, first, mcgill, director, of, athletics, but, then, left, montreal, to, study, at, the, ymca, international, training, school, in, springfield, massachusetts, naismith, played, football, during, his, one, year, as, a, student, at, springfield, where, he, was, coached, by, amos, alonzo, stagg, and, scored, a, touchdown, in, the, first, exhibition, of, indoor, college, football, at, madison, square, garden, naismith, is, credited, with, inventing, basketball, naismith, was, an, outstanding, football, player, at, mcgill, university, in, montreal, when, he, realized, he, needed, to, invent, an, indoor, game, for, the, winter, due, to, the, weather, conditions, he, later, decided, to, become, a, physical, education, teacher, at, mcgill, university, for, his, three, postgraduate, years, and, then, went, to, springfield, massachusetts, to, study, at, the, ymca, international, training, school, in, the, 1890s, after, completing, the, ymca, physical, director, training, program, that, had, brought, him, to, springfield, naismith, was, hired, as, a, full, time, faculty, member, in, 1891, at, the, springfield, ymca, naismith, struggled, with, a, rowdy, class, that, was, confined, to, indoor, games, throughout, the, harsh, new, england, winter, and, thus, was, perpetually, short, tempered, under, orders, from, luther, gulick, head, of, physical, education, there, naismith, was, given, 14, days, to, create, an, indoor, game, that, would, provide, an, athletic, distraction, gulick, demanded, that, it, would, not, take, up, much, room, could, help, its, track, athletes, to, keep, in, shape, and, explicitly, emphasized, to, make, it, fair, for, all, players, and, not, too, rough, naismith, was, later, employed, to, teach, physical, education, using, two, boxes, he, told, the, superintendent, he, needed, the, two, boxes, to, be, put, onto, a, pole, so, a, large, ball, could, be, thrown, into, them, in, his, attempt, to, think, up, a, new, game, naismith, was, guided, by, three, main, thoughts, firstly, he, analyzed, the, most, popular, games, of, the, times, rugby, lacrosse, soccer, football, hockey, and, baseball, naismith, noticed, the, hazards, of, a, ball, and, concluded, that, the, big, soft, soccer, ball, was, safest, secondly, he, saw, that, most, physical, contact, occurred, while, running, with, the, ball, dribbling, or, hitting, it, so, he, decided, that, passing, was, the, only, legal, option, finally, naismith, further, reduced, body, contact, by, making, the, goal, unguardable, by, placing, it, high, above, the, player, s, heads, with, the, plane, of, the, goal, s, opening, parallel, to, the, floor, this, placement, forced, the, players, to, score, goals, by, throwing, a, soft, lobbing, shot, like, that, which, had, proven, effective, in, his, old, favorite, game, duck, on, a, rock, for, this, purpose, naismith, asked, a, janitor, to, find, a, pair, of, boxes, but, the, janitor, brought, him, peach, baskets, instead, naismith, christened, this, new, game, basket, ball, and, put, his, thoughts, together, in, 13, basic, rules, the, first, game, of, basket, ball, was, played, in, december, 1891, in, a, handwritten, report, naismith, described, the, circumstances, of, the, inaugural, match, in, contrast, to, modern, basketball, the, players, played, nine, versus, nine, handled, a, soccer, ball, not, a, basketball, and, instead, of, shooting, at, two, hoops, the, goals, were, a, pair, of, peach, baskets, when, mr, stubbins, brot, up, the, peach, baskets, to, the, gym, i, secured, them, on, the, inside, of, the, railing, of, the, gallery, this, was, about, 10, feet, from, the, floor, one, at, each, end, of, the, gymnasium, i, then, put, the, 13, rules, on, the, bulletin, board, just, behind, the, instructor, s, platform, secured, a, soccer, ball, and, awaited, the, arrival, of, the, class, the, class, did, not, show, much, enthusiasm, but, followed, my, lead, i, then, explained, what, they, had, to, do, to, make, goals, tossed, the, ball, up, between, the, two, center, men, and, tried, to, keep, them, somewhat, near, the, rules, most, of, the, fouls, were, called, for, running, with, the, ball, though, tackling, the, man, with, the, ball, was, not, uncommon, in, contrast, to, modern, basketball, the, original, rules, did, not, include, what, is, known, today, as, the, dribble, since, the, ball, could, only, be, moved, up, the, court, by, a, pass, early, players, tossed, the, ball, over, their, heads, as, they, ran, up, court, also, following, each, goal, a, jump, ball, was, taken, in, the, middle, of, the, court, both, practices, are, obsolete, in, the, rules, of, modern, basketball, in, a, radio, interview, in, january, 1939, naismith, gave, more, details, of, the, first, game, and, the, initial, rules, that, were, used, i, showed, them, two, peach, baskets, i, d, nailed, up, at, each, end, of, the, gym, and, i, told, them, the, idea, was, to, throw, the, ball, into, the, opposing, team, s, peach, basket, i, blew, a, whistle, and, the, first, game, of, basketball, began, the, boys, began, tackling, kicking, and, punching, in, the, clinches, they, ended, up, in, a, free, for, all, in, the, middle, of, the, gym, floor, it, certainly, was, murder, the, most, important, one, was, that, there, should, be, no, running, with, the, ball, that, stopped, tackling, and, slugging, we, tried, out, the, game, with, those, rules, fouls, and, we, didn, t, have, one, casualty, naismith, was, a, classmate, of, amos, alonzo, stagg, at, the, ymca, school, where, stagg, coached, the, football, team, they, became, close, friends, and, naismith, played, on, the, football, team, and, stagg, played, on, the, basketball, team, naismith, invited, stagg, to, play, in, the, first, public, basketball, game, on, march, 12, 1892, the, students, defeated, the, faculty, 5, 1, and, stagg, scored, the, only, basket, for, the, faculty, the, springfield, republican, reported, on, the, same, over, 200, spectators, crammed, their, necks, over, the, gallery, railing, of, the, christian, workers, gymnasium, while, they, watched, the, game, of, basket, ball, between, the, teachers, and, the, students, the, most, conspicuous, figure, on, the, floor, was, stagg, in, the, blue, yale, uniform, who, managed, to, have, a, hand, in, every, scrimmage, by, 1892, basketball, had, grown, so, popular, on, campus, that, dennis, horkenbach, editor, in, chief, of, the, triangle, the, springfield, college, newspaper, featured, it, in, an, article, called, a, new, game, and, there, were, calls, to, call, this, new, game, naismith, ball, but, naismith, refused, by, 1893, basketball, was, introduced, internationally, by, the, ymca, movement, from, springfield, naismith, went, to, denver, where, he, acquired, a, medical, degree, and, in, 1898, he, joined, the, university, of, kansas, faculty, at, lawrence, the, family, of, lambert, g, will, disputing, naismith, s, sole, creation, of, the, game, has, claimed, that, naismith, borrowed, components, for, the, game, of, basketball, from, will, citing, alleged, photos, and, letters, in, an, interview, the, family, did, give, naismith, credit, for, the, general, idea, of, the, sport, but, they, claimed, will, changed, aspects, of, naismith, s, original, plans, for, the, game, and, naismith, took, credit, for, the, changes, spalding, worked, with, naismith, to, develop, the, official, basketball, and, the, spalding, athletic, library, official, basketball, rule, book, for, 1893, 1894, the, university, of, kansas, men, s, basketball, program, officially, began, following, naismith, s, arrival, in, 1898, seven, years, after, naismith, drafted, the, sport, s, first, official, rules, naismith, was, not, initially, hired, to, coach, basketball, but, rather, as, a, chapel, director, and, physical, education, instructor, in, those, early, days, the, majority, of, the, basketball, games, were, played, against, nearby, ymca, teams, with, ymcas, across, the, nation, having, played, an, integral, part, in, the, birth, of, basketball, other, common, opponents, were, haskell, indian, nations, university, and, william, jewell, college, under, naismith, the, team, played, only, one, current, big, 12, school, kansas, state, once, naismith, is, ironically, the, only, coach, in, the, program, s, history, to, have, a, losing, record, 55, 60, however, naismith, coached, forrest, phog, allen, his, eventual, successor, at, kansas, who, went, on, to, join, his, mentor, in, the, naismith, memorial, basketball, hall, of, fame, when, allen, became, a, coach, himself, and, told, him, that, he, was, going, to, coach, basketball, at, baker, university, in, 1904, naismith, discouraged, him, you, can, t, coach, basketball, you, just, play, it, instead, allen, embarked, on, a, coaching, career, that, would, lead, him, to, be, known, as, the, father, of, basketball, coaching, during, his, time, at, kansas, allen, coached, dean, smith, 1952, national, championship, team, and, adolph, rupp, 1922, helms, foundation, national, championship, team, smith, and, rupp, have, joined, naismith, and, allen, as, members, of, the, basketball, hall, of, fame, by, the, turn, of, the, century, enough, college, teams, were, in, the, east, that, the, first, intercollegiate, competitions, could, be, played, out, although, the, sport, continued, to, grow, naismith, long, regarded, the, game, as, a, curiosity, and, preferred, gymnastics, and, wrestling, as, better, forms, of, physical, activity, however, basketball, became, a, demonstration, sport, at, the, 1904, summer, olympics, in, st, louis, as, the, naismith, memorial, basketball, hall, of, fame, reports, naismith, was, not, interested, in, self, promotion, nor, was, he, interested, in, the, glory, of, competitive, sports, instead, he, was, more, interested, in, his, physical, education, career, he, received, an, honorary, pe, master, s, degree, in, 1910, patrolled, the, mexican, border, for, four, months, in, 1916, traveled, to, france, and,

redefined, as, a, professorship, he, served, as, the, de, facto, athletic, director, at, kansas, for, much, of, the, early, 20th, century, naismith, had, strong, feelings, against, segregation, dating, back, to, his, world, war, i, era, service, in, france, and, his, service, on, the, united, states, mexico, border, and, he, strove, for, progress, in, race, relations, through, modest, steps, during, the, 1930s, he, would, not, or, could, not, get, african, americans, onto, kansas, varsity, jayhawks, but, he, did, help, engineer, the, admission, of, black, students, to, the, university, s, swimming, pool, until, then, they, had, been, given, automatic, passing, grades, on, a, required, swimming, test, without, entering, the, pool, so, it, could, remain, all, white, through, naismith, s, association, with, baker, university, basketball, coach, emil, liston, he, became, familiar, and, impressed, with, emil, liston, s, fraternity, at, baker, university, sigma, phi, epsilon, sigep, as, a, result, he, started, the, effort, to, bring, a, sigma, phi, epsilon, chapter, to, his, university, of, kansas, ku, on, february, 18, 1923, naismith, intending, to, bring, a, sigep, chapter, to, ku,

interviewed, during, that, era, remembered, naismith, he, was, deeply, religious, he, listened, more, than, he, spoke, he, thought, sports, were, nothing, but, an, avenue, to, keep, young, people, involved, so, they, could, do, their, studies, and, relate, to, their, community, and, it, was, really, nice, having, someone, with, the, caliber, of, dr, naismith, he, helped, many, a, sigep, in, 1935, the, national, association, of, basketball, coaches, founded, by, naismith, s, pupil, phog, allen, collected, money, so, the, 74, year, old, naismith, could, witness, the, introduction, of,
