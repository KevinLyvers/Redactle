variste, galois, l, w, french, 25, october, 1811, 31, may, 1832, was, a, french, mathematician, and, political, activist, while, still, in, his, teens, he, was, able, to, determine, a, necessary, and, sufficient, condition, for, a, polynomial, to, be, solvable, by, radicals, thereby, solving, a, problem, that, had, been, open, for, 350, years, his, work, laid, the, foundations, for, galois, theory, and, group, theory, two, major, branches, of, abstract, algebra, galois, was, a, staunch, republican, and, was, heavily, involved, in, the, political, turmoil, that, surrounded, the, french, revolution, of, 1830, as, a, result, of, his, political, activism, he, was, arrested, repeatedly, serving, one, jail, sentence, of, several, months, for, reasons, that, remain, obscure, shortly, after, his, release, from, prison, galois, fought, in, a, duel, and, died, of, the, wounds, he, suffered, galois, was, born, on, 25, october, 1811, to, nicolas, gabriel, galois, and, ad, la, de, marie, n, e, demante, his, father, was, a, republican, and, was, head, of, bourg, la, reine, s, liberal, party, his, father, became, mayor, of, the, village, after, louis, xviii, returned, to, the, throne, in, 1814, his, mother, the, daughter, of, a, jurist, was, a, fluent, reader, of, latin, and, classical, literature, and, was, responsible, for, her, son, s, education, for, his, first, twelve, years, in, october, 1823, he, entered, the, lyc, e, louis, le, grand, where, his, teacher, louis, paul, mile, richard, recognized, his, brilliance, at, the, age, of, 14, he, began, to, take, a, serious, interest, in, mathematics, galois, found, a, copy, of, adrien, marie, legendre, s, l, ments, de, g, om, trie, which, it, is, said, he, read, like, a, novel, and, mastered, at, the, first, reading, at, 15, he, was, reading, the, original, papers, of, joseph, louis, lagrange, such, as, the, r, flexions, sur, la, r, solution, alg, brique, des, quations, which, likely, motivated, his, later, work, on, equation, theory, and, le, ons, sur, le, calcul, des, fonctions, work, intended, for, professional, mathematicians, yet, his, classwork, remained, uninspired, and, his, teachers, accused, him, of, putting, on, the, airs, of, a, genius, in, 1828, galois, attempted, the, entrance, examination, for, the, cole, polytechnique, the, most, prestigious, institution, for, mathematics, in, france, at, the, time, without, the, usual, preparation, in, mathematics, and, failed, for, lack, of, explanations, on, the, oral, examination, in, that, same, year, he, entered, the, cole, normale, then, known, as, l, cole, pr, paratoire, a, far, inferior, institution, for, mathematical, studies, at, that, time, where, he, found, some, professors, sympathetic, to, him, in, the, following, year, galois, s, first, paper, on, continued, fractions, was, published, it, was, at, around, the, same, time, that, he, began, making, fundamental, discoveries, in, the, theory, of, polynomial, equations, he, submitted, two, papers, on, this, topic, to, the, academy, of, sciences, augustin, louis, cauchy, refereed, these, papers, but, refused, to, accept, them, for, publication, for, reasons, that, still, remain, unclear, however, in, spite, of, many, claims, to, the, contrary, it, is, widely, held, that, cauchy, recognized, the, importance, of, galois, s, work, and, that, he, merely, suggested, combining, the, two, papers, into, one, in, order, to, enter, it, in, the, competition, for, the, academy, s, grand, prize, in, mathematics, cauchy, an, eminent, mathematician, of, the, time, though, with, political, views, that, were, diametrically, opposed, to, those, of, galois, considered, galois, s, work, to, be, a, likely, winner, on, 28, july, 1829, galois, s, father, died, by, suicide, after, a, bitter, political, dispute, with, the, village, priest, a, couple, of, days, later, galois, made, his, second, and, last, attempt, to, enter, the, polytechnique, and, failed, yet, again, it, is, undisputed, that, galois, was, more, than, qualified, accounts, differ, on, why, he, failed, more, plausible, accounts, state, that, galois, made, too, many, logical, leaps, and, baffled, the, incompetent, examiner, which, enraged, galois, the, recent, death, of, his, father, may, have, also, influenced, his, behavior, having, been, denied, admission, to, the, cole, polytechnique, galois, took, the, baccalaureate, examinations, in, order, to, enter, the, cole, normale, he, passed, receiving, his, degree, on, 29, december, 1829, his, examiner, in, mathematics, reported, this, pupil, is, sometimes, obscure, in, expressing, his, ideas, but, he, is, intelligent, and, shows, a, remarkable, spirit, of, research, galois, submitted, his, memoir, on, equation, theory, several, times, but, it, was, never, published, in, his, lifetime, though, his, first, attempt, was, refused, by, cauchy, in, february, 1830, following, cauchy, s, suggestion, he, submitted, it, to, the, academy, s, secretary, joseph, fourier, to, be, considered, for, the, grand, prix, of, the, academy, unfortunately, fourier, died, soon, after, and, the, memoir, was, lost, the, prize, would, be, awarded, that, year, to, niels, henrik, abel, posthumously, and, also, to, carl, gustav, jacob, jacobi, despite, the, lost, memoir, galois, published, three, papers, that, year, one, laid, the, foundations, for, galois, theory, the, second, was, about, the, numerical, resolution, of, equations, root, finding, in, modern, terminology, the, third, was, an, important, one, in, number, theory, in, which, the, concept, of, a, finite, field, was, first, articulated, galois, lived, during, a, time, of, political, turmoil, in, france, charles, x, had, succeeded, louis, xviii, in, 1824, but, in, 1827, his, party, suffered, a, major, electoral, setback, and, by, 1830, the, opposition, liberal, party, became, the, majority, charles, faced, with, political, opposition, from, the, chambers, staged, a, coup, d, tat, and, issued, his, notorious, july, ordinances, touching, off, the, july, revolution, which, ended, with, louis, philippe, becoming, king, while, their, counterparts, at, the, polytechnique, were, making, history, in, the, streets, galois, at, the, cole, normale, was, locked, in, by, the, school, s, director, galois, was, incensed, and, wrote, a, blistering, letter, criticizing, the, director, which, he, submitted, to, the, gazette, des, coles, signing, the, letter, with, his, full, name, although, the, gazette, s, editor, omitted, the, signature, for, publication, galois, was, expelled, although, his, expulsion, would, have, formally, taken, effect, on, 4, january, 1831, galois, quit, school, immediately, and, joined, the, staunchly, republican, artillery, unit, of, the, national, guard, he, divided, his, time, between, his, mathematical, work, and, his, political, affiliations, due, to, controversy, surrounding, the, unit, soon, after, galois, became, a, member, on, 31, december, 1830, the, artillery, of, the, national, guard, was, disbanded, out, of, fear, that, they, might, destabilize, the, government, at, around, the, same, time, nineteen, officers, of, galois, s, former, unit, were, arrested, and, charged, with, conspiracy, to, overthrow, the, government, in, april, 1831, the, officers, were, acquitted, of, all, charges, and, on, 9, may, 1831, a, banquet, was, held, in, their, honor, with, many, illustrious, people, present, such, as, alexandre, dumas, the, proceedings, grew, riotous, at, some, point, galois, stood, and, proposed, a, toast, in, which, he, said, to, louis, philippe, with, a, dagger, above, his, cup, the, republicans, at, the, banquet, interpreted, galois, s, toast, as, a, threat, against, the, king, s, life, and, cheered, he, was, arrested, the, following, day, at, his, mother, s, house, and, held, in, detention, at, sainte, p, lagie, prison, until, 15, june, 1831, when, he, had, his, trial, galois, s, defense, lawyer, cleverly, claimed, that, galois, actually, said, to, louis, philippe, if, he, betrays, but, that, the, qualifier, was, drowned, out, in, the, cheers, the, prosecutor, asked, a, few, more, questions, and, perhaps, influenced, by, galois, s, youth, the, jury, acquitted, him, that, same, day, on, the, following, bastille, day, 14, july, 1831, galois, was, at, the, head, of, a, protest, wearing, the, uniform, of, the, disbanded, artillery, and, came, heavily, armed, with, several, pistols, a, loaded, rifle, and, a, dagger, he, was, again, arrested, during, his, stay, in, prison, galois, at, one, point, drank, alcohol, for, the, first, time, at, the, goading, of, his, fellow, inmates, one, of, these, inmates, fran, ois, vincent, raspail, recorded, what, galois, said, while, drunk, in, a, letter, from, 25, july, excerpted, from, the, letter, and, i, tell, you, i, will, die, in, a, duel, on, the, occasion, of, some, coquette, de, bas, tage, why, because, she, will, invite, me, to, avenge, her, honor, which, another, has, compromised, do, you, know, what, i, lack, my, friend, i, can, confide, it, only, to, you, it, is, someone, whom, i, can, love, and, love, only, in, spirit, i, ve, lost, my, father, and, no, one, has, ever, replaced, him, do, you, hear, me, raspail, continues, that, galois, still, in, a, delirium, attempted, suicide, and, that, he, would, have, succeeded, if, his, fellow, inmates, had, not, forcibly, stopped, him, months, later, when, galois, s, trial, occurred, on, 23, october, he, was, sentenced, to, six, months, in, prison, for, illegally, wearing, a, uniform, while, in, prison, he, continued, to, develop, his, mathematical, ideas, he, was, released, on, 29, april, 1832, galois, returned, to, mathematics, after, his, expulsion, from, the, cole, normale, although, he, continued, to, spend, time, in, political, activities, after, his, expulsion, became, official, in, january, 1831, he, attempted, to, start, a, private, class, in, advanced, algebra, which, attracted, some, interest, but, this, waned, as, it, seemed, that, his, political, activism, had, priority, sim, on, denis, poisson, asked, him, to, submit, his, work, on, the, theory, of, equations, which, he, did, on, 17, january, 1831, around, 4, july, 1831, poisson, declared, galois, s, work, incomprehensible, declaring, that, argument, is, neither, sufficiently, clear, nor, sufficiently, developed, to, allow, us, to, judge, its, rigor, however, the, rejection, report, ends, on, an, encouraging, note, we, would, then, suggest, that, the, author, should, publish, the, whole, of, his, work, in, order, to, form, a, definitive, opinion, while, poisson, s, report, was, made, before, galois, s, 14, july, arrest, it, took, until, october, to, reach, galois, in, prison, it, is, unsurprising, in, the, light, of, his, character, and, situation, at, the, time, that, galois, reacted, violently, to, the, rejection, letter, and, decided, to, abandon, publishing, his, papers, through, the, academy, and, instead, publish, them, privately, through, his, friend, auguste, chevalier, apparently, however, galois, did, not, ignore, poisson, s, advice, as, he, began, collecting, all, his, mathematical, manuscripts, while, still, in, prison, and, continued, polishing, his, ideas, until, his, release, on, 29, april, 1832, after, which, he, was, somehow, talked, into, a, duel, galois, s, fatal, duel, took, place, on, 30, may, the, true, motives, behind, the, duel, are, obscure, there, has, been, much, speculation, about, them, what, is, known, is, that, five, days, before, his, death, he, wrote, a, letter, to, chevalier, which, clearly, alludes, to, a, broken, love, affair, some, archival, investigation, on, the, original, letters, suggests, that, the, woman, of, romantic, interest, was, st, phanie, f, licie, poterin, du, motel, the, daughter, of, the, physician, at, the, hostel, where, galois, stayed, during, the, last, months, of, his, life, fragments, of, letters, from, her, copied, by, galois, himself, with, many, portions, such, as, her, name, either, obliterated, or, deliberately, omitted, are, available, the, letters, hint, that, poterin, du, motel, had, confided, some, of, her, troubles, to, galois, and, this, might, have, prompted, him, to, provoke, the, duel, himself, on, her, behalf, this, conjecture, is, also, supported, by, other, letters, galois, later, wrote, to, his, friends, the, night, before, he, died, galois, s, cousin, gabriel, demante, when, asked, if, he, knew, the, cause, of, the, duel, mentioned, that, galois, found, himself, in, the, presence, of, a, supposed, uncle, and, a, supposed, fianc, each, of, whom, provoked, the, duel, galois, himself, exclaimed, i, am, the, victim, of, an, infamous, coquette, and, her, two, dupes, as, to, his, opponent, in, the, duel, alexandre, dumas, names, pescheux, d, herbinville, who, was, actually, one, of, the, nineteen, artillery, officers, whose, acquittal, was, celebrated, at, the, banquet, that, occasioned, galois, s, first, arrest, however, dumas, is, alone, in, this, assertion, and, if, he, were, correct, it, is, unclear, why, d, herbinville, would, have, been, involved, it, has, been, speculated, that, he, was, poterin, du, motel, s, supposed, fianc, at, the, time, she, ultimately, married, someone, else, but, no, clear, evidence, has, been, found, supporting, this, conjecture, on, the, other, hand, extant, newspaper, clippings, from, only, a, few, days, after, the, duel, give, a, description, of, his, opponent, identified, by, the, initials, l, d, that, appear, to, more, accurately, apply, to, one, of, galois, s, republican, friends, most, probably, ernest, duchatelet, who, was, imprisoned, with, galois, on, the, same, charges, given, the, conflicting, information, available, the, true, identity, of, his, killer, may, well, be, lost, to, history, whatever, the, reasons, behind, the, duel, galois, was, so, convinced, of, his, impending, death, that, he, stayed, up, all, night, writing, letters, to, his, republican, friends, and, composing, what, would, become, his, mathematical, testament, the, famous, letter, to, auguste, chevalier, outlining, his, ideas, and, three, attached, manuscripts, mathematician, hermann, weyl, said, of, this, testament, this, letter, if, judged, by, the, novelty, and, profundity, of, ideas, it, contains, is, perhaps, the, most, substantial, piece, of, writing, in, the, whole, literature, of, mankind, however, the, legend, of, galois, pouring, his, mathematical, thoughts, onto, paper, the, night, before, he, died, seems, to, have, been, exaggerated, in, these, final, papers, he, outlined, the, rough, edges, of, some, work, he, had, been, doing, in, analysis, and, annotated, a, copy, of, the, manuscript, submitted, to, the, academy, and, other, papers, early, in, the, morning, of, 30, may, 1832, he, was, shot, in, the, abdomen, was, abandoned, by, his, opponents, and, his, own, seconds, and, was, found, by, a, passing, farmer, he, died, the, following, morning, at, ten, o, clock, in, the, h, pital, cochin, probably, of, peritonitis, after, refusing, the, offices, of, a, priest, his, funeral, ended, in, riots, there, were, plans, to, initiate, an, uprising, during, his, funeral, but, during, the, same, time, the, leaders, heard, of, general, jean, maximilien, lamarque, s, death, and, the, rising, was, postponed, without, any, uprising, occurring, until, 5, june, only, galois, s, younger, brother, was, notified, of, the, events, prior, to, galois, s, death, galois, was, 20, years, old, his, last, words, to, his, younger, brother, alfred, were, ne, pleure, pas, alfred, j, ai, besoin, de, tout, mon, courage, pour, mourir, vingt, ans, don, t, weep, alfred, i, need, all, my, courage, to, die, at, twenty, on, 2, june, variste, galois, was, buried, in, a, common, grave, of, the, montparnasse, cemetery, whose, exact, location, is, unknown, in, the, cemetery, of, his, native, town, bourg, la, reine, a, cenotaph, in, his, honour, was, erected, beside, the, graves, of, his, relatives, variste, galois, died, in, 1832, joseph, liouville, began, studying, galois, s, unpublished, papers, in, 1842, and, acknowledged, their, value, in, 1843, it, is, not, clear, what, happened, in, the, 10, years, between, 1832, and, 1842, nor, what, eventually, inspired, joseph, liouville, to, begin, reading, galois, s, papers, jesper, l, tzen, explores, this, subject, at, some, length, in, chapter, xiv, galois, theory, of, his, book, about, joseph, liouville, without, reaching, any, definitive, conclusions, it, is, certainly, possible, that, mathematicians, including, liouville, did, not, want, to, publicize, galois, s, papers, because, galois, was, a, republican, political, activist, who, died, 5, days, before, the, june, rebellion, an, unsuccessful, anti, monarchist, insurrection, of, parisian, republicans, in, galois, s, obituary, his, friend, auguste, chevalier, almost, accused, academicians, at, the, cole, polytechnique, of, having, killed, galois, since, if, they, had, not, rejected, his, work, he, would, have, become, a, mathematician, and, would, not, have, devoted, himself, to, the, republican, political, activism, for, which, some, believed, he, was, killed, given, that, france, was, still, living, in, the, shadow, of, the, reign, of, terror, and, the, napoleonic, era, liouville, might, have, waited, until, the, june, rebellion, s, political, turmoil, subsided, before, turning, his, attention, to, galois, s, papers, liouville, finally, published, galois, s, manuscripts, in, the, october, november, 1846, issue, of, the, journal, de, math, matiques, pures, et, appliqu, es, galois, s, most, famous, contribution, was, a, novel, proof, that, there, is, no, quintic, formula, that, is, that, fifth, and, higher, degree, equations, are, not, generally, solvable, by, radicals, although, niels, henrik, abel, had, already, proved, the, impossibility, of, a, quintic, formula, by, radicals, in, 1824, and, paolo, ruffini, had, published, a, solution, in, 1799, that, turned, out, to, be, flawed, galois, s, methods, led, to, deeper, research, into, what, is, now, called, galois, theory, which, can, be, used, to, determine, for, any, polynomial, equation, whether, it, has, a, solution, by, radicals, from, the, closing, lines, of, a, letter, from, galois, to, his, friend, auguste, chevalier, dated, 29, may, 1832, two, days, before, galois, s, death, tu, prieras, publiquement, jacobi, ou, gauss, de, donner, leur, avis, non, sur, la, v, rit, mais, sur, l, importance, des, th, or, mes, apr, s, cela, il, y, aura, j, esp, re, des, gens, qui, trouveront, leur, profit, d, chiffrer, tout, ce, g, chis, ask, jacobi, or, gauss, publicly, to, give, their, opinion, not, as, to, the, truth, but, as, to, the, importance, of, these, theorems, later, there, will, be, i, hope, some, people, who, will, find, it, to, their, advantage, to, decipher, all, this, mess, within, the, 60, or, so, pages, of, galois, s, collected, works, are, many, important, ideas, that, have, had, far, reaching, consequences, for, nearly, all, branches, of, mathematics, his, work, has, been, compared, to, that, of, niels, henrik, abel, 1802, 1829, a, contemporary, mathematician, who, also, died, at, a, very, young, age, and, much, of, their, work, had, significant, overlap, while, many, mathematicians, before, galois, gave, consideration, to, what, are, now, known, as, groups, it, was, galois, who, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, group, in, french, groupe, in, a, sense, close, to, the, technical, sense, that, is, understood, today, making, him, among, the, founders, of, the, branch, of, algebra, known, as, group, theory, he, called, the, decomposition, of, a, group, into, its, left, and, right, cosets, a, proper, decomposition, if, the, left, and, right, cosets, coincide, which, is, what, today, is, known, as, a, normal, subgroup, he, also, introduced, the, concept, of, a, finite, field, also, known, as, a, galois, field, in, his, honor, in, essentially, the, same, form, as, it, is, understood, today, in, his, last, letter, to, chevalier, and, attached, manuscripts, the, second, of, three, he, made, basic, studies, of, linear, groups, over, finite, fields, galois, s, most, significant, contribution, to, mathematics, is, his, development, of, galois, theory, he, realized, that, the, algebraic, solution, to, a, polynomial, equation, is, related, to, the, structure, of, a, group, of, permutations, associated, with, the, roots, of, the, polynomial, the, galois, group, of, the, polynomial, he, found, that, an, equation, could, be, solved, in, radicals, if, one, can, find, a, series, of, subgroups, of, its, galois, group, each, one, normal, in, its, successor, with, abelian, quotient, that, is, its, galois, group, is, solvable, this, proved, to, be, a, fertile, approach, which, later, mathematicians, adapted, to, many, other, fields, of, mathematics, besides, the, theory, of, equations, to, which, galois, originally, applied, it, galois, also, made, some, contributions, to, the, theory, of, abelian, integrals, and, continued, fractions, as, written, in, his, last, letter, galois, passed, from, the, study, of, elliptic, functions, to, consideration, of, the, integrals, of, the, most, general, algebraic, differentials, today, called, abelian, integrals, he, classified, these, integrals, into, three, categories, in, his, first, paper, in, 1828, galois, proved, that, the, regular, continued, fraction, which, represents, a, quadratic, surd, is, purely, periodic, if, and, only, if, is, a, reduced, surd, that, is, 1, displaystyle, zeta, 1, and, its, conjugate, displaystyle, eta, satisfies, 1, 0, displaystyle, 1, eta, 0, in, fact, galois, showed, more, than, this, he, also, proved, that, if, is, a, reduced, quadratic, surd, and, is, its, conjugate, then, the, continued, fractions, for, and, for, 1, are, both, purely, periodic, and, the, repeating, block, in, one, of, those, continued, fractions, is, the, mirror, image, of, the, repeating, block, in, the, other, in, symbols, we, have, where, is, any, reduced, quadratic, surd, and, is, its, conjugate, from, these, two, theorems, of, galois, a, result, already, known, to, lagrange, can, be, deduced, if, r, 1, is, a, rational, number, that, is, not, a, perfect, square, then, in, particular, if, n, is, any, non, square, positive, integer, the, regular, continued, fraction, expansion, of, n, contains, a, repeating, block, of, length, m, in, which, the, first, m, 1, partial, denominators, form, a, palindromic, string
