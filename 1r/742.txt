by, historian, abd, al, wahid, al, marrakushi, the, caliph, asked, averroes, whether, the, heavens, had, existed, since, eternity, or, had, a, beginning, knowing, this, question, was, controversial, and, worried, a, wrong, answer, could, put, him, in, danger, averroes, did, not, answer, the, caliph, then, elaborated, the, views, of, plato, aristotle, and, muslim, philosophers, on, the, topic, and, discussed, them, with, ibn, tufayl, this, display, of, knowledge, put, averroes, at, ease, averroes, then, explained, his, views, on, the, subject, which, impressed, the, caliph, averroes, was, similarly, impressed, by, abu, yaqub, and, later, said, the, caliph, had, a, profuseness, of, learning, i, did, not, suspect, after, their, introduction, averroes, remained, in, abu, yaqub, s, favor, until, the, caliph, died, in, 1184, when, the, caliph, complained, to, ibn, tufayl, about, the, difficulty, of, understanding, aristotle, s, work, ibn, tufayl, recommended, to, the, caliph, that, averroes, work, on, explaining, it, this, was, the, beginning, of, averroes, s, massive, commentaries, on, aristotle, his, first, works, on, the, subject, were, written, in, 1169, in, the, same, year,

and, banished, averroes, to, nearby, lucena, early, biographers, reasons, for, this, fall, from, grace, include, a, possible, insult, to, the, caliph, in, his, writings, but, modern, scholars, attribute, it, to, political, reasons, the, encyclopaedia, of, islam, said, the, caliph, distanced, himself, from, averroes, to, gain, support, from, more, orthodox, ulema, who, opposed, averroes, and, whose, support, al, mansur, needed, for, his, war, against, christian, kingdoms, historian, of, islamic, philosophy, majid, fakhry, also, wrote, that, public, pressure, from, traditional, maliki,

subjects, than, those, of, any, of, his, predecessors, in, the, east, including, philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence, or, legal, theory, and, linguistics, most, of, his, writings, were, commentaries,

jurisprudence, both, in, practice, and, in, their, underlying, juristic, principles, as, well, as, the, reason, why, they, are, inevitable, despite, his, status, as, a, maliki, judge, the, book, also, discusses, the, opinion, of, other, schools, including, liberal, and, conservative, ones, other, than, this, surviving, text, bibliographical, information, shows, he, wrote, a, summary, of, al, ghazali, s, on, legal, theory, of, muslim, jurisprudence, al, mustasfa, and, tracts, on, sacrifices, and, land, tax, in, his, philosophical, writings, averroes, attempted, to, return, to, aristotelianism, which, according, to, him, had, been, distorted, by, the, neoplatonist, tendencies, of, muslim, philosophers, such, as, al, farabi, and, avicenna, he, rejected, al, farabi, s, attempt, to, merge, the, ideas, of, plato, and, aristotle, pointing, out, the, differences, between, the, two, such, as, aristotle, s, rejection, of, plato, s, theory, of, ideas, he, also, criticized, al, farabi, s, works, on, logic, for, misinterpreting, its, aristotelian, source, he, wrote, an, extensive, critique, of, avicenna, who, was, the, standard, bearer, of, islamic, neoplatonism, in, the, middle, ages, he, argued, that, avicenna, s, theory, of, emanation, had, many, fallacies, and, was, not, found, in, the, works, of, aristotle, averroes, disagreed, with, avicenna, s, view, that, existence, is, merely, an, accident, added, to, essence, arguing, the, reverse, something, exists, per, se, and, essence, can, only, be, found, by, subsequent, abstraction, he, also, rejected, avicenna, s, modality, and, avicenna, s, argument, to, prove, the, existence, of, god, as, the, necessary, existent, averroes, felt, strongly, about, the, incorporation, of, greek, thought, into, the, muslim, world, and, wrote, that, if, before, us, someone, has, inquired, into, it, behooves, us, to, seek, help, from, what, he, has, said, it, is, irrelevant, whether, he, belongs, to, our, community, or, to, another, during, averroes, s, lifetime, philosophy, came, under, attack, from, the, sunni, tradition, especially, from, theological, schools, like, the, hanbali, school, and, the, ash, arites, in, particular, the, ash, ari, scholar, al, ghazali, 1058, 1111, wrote, the, incoherence, of, the, philosophers, a, scathing, and, influential, critique, of, the, neoplatonic, philosophical, tradition, in, the, islamic, world, and, against, the, works, of, avicenna, in, particular, among, others, al, ghazali, charged, philosophers, with, non, belief, in, islam, and, sought, to, disprove, the, teaching, of, the, philosophers, using, logical, arguments, in, decisive, treatise, averroes, argues, that, philosophy, which, for, him, represented, conclusions, reached, using, reason, and, careful, method, cannot, contradict, revelations, in, islam, because, they, are, just, two, different, methods, of, reaching, the, truth, and, truth, cannot, contradict, truth, when, conclusions, reached, by, philosophy, appear, to, contradict, the, text, of, the, revelation, then, according, to, averroes, revelation, must, be, subjected, to, interpretation, or, allegorical, understanding, to, remove, the, contradiction, this, interpretation, must, be, done, by, those, rooted, in, knowledge, a, phrase, taken, from, surah, l, imr, n, 3, 7, of, the, quran, which, for, averroes, refers, to, philosophers, who, during, his, lifetime, had, access, to, the, highest, methods, of, knowledge, he, also, argues, that, the, quran, calls, for, muslims, to, study, philosophy, because, the, study, and, reflection, of, nature, would, increase, a, person, s, knowledge, of, the, artisan, god, he, quotes, quranic, passages, calling, muslims, to, reflect, on, nature, he, uses, them, to, render, a, fatwa, that, philosophy, is, allowed, for, muslims, and, is, probably, an, obligation, at, least, among, those, who, have, the, talent, for, it, averroes, also, distinguishes, between, three, modes, of, discourse, the, rhetorical, based, on, persuasion, accessible, to, the, common, masses, the, dialectical, based, on, debate, and, often, employed, by, theologians, and, the, ulama, religious, scholars, and, the, demonstrative, based, on, logical, deduction, according, to, averroes, the, quran, uses, the, rhetorical, method, of, inviting, people, to, the, truth, which, allows, it, to, reach, the, common, masses, with, its, persuasiveness, whereas, philosophy, uses, the, demonstrative, methods, that, were, only, available, to, the, learned, but, provided, the, best, possible, understanding, and, knowledge, averroes, also, tries, to, deflect, al, ghazali, s, criticisms, of, philosophy, by, saying, that, many, of, them, apply, only, to, the, philosophy, of, avicenna, and, not, to, that, of, aristotle, which, averroes, argues, to, be, the, true, philosophy, from, which, avicenna, has, deviated, averroes, lays, out, his, views, on, the, existence, and, nature, of, god, in, the, treatise, the, exposition, of, the, methods, of, proof, he, examines, and, critiques, the, doctrines, of, four, sects, of, islam, the, asharites, the, mutazilites, the, sufis, and, those, he, calls, the, literalists, al, hashwiyah, among, other, things, he, examines, their, proofs, of, god, s, existence, and, critiques, each, one, averroes, argues, that, there, are, two, arguments, for, god, s, existence, that, he, deems, logically, sound, and, in, accordance, to, the, quran, the, arguments, from, providence, and, from, invention, the, providence, argument, considers, that, the, world, and, the, universe, seem, finely, tuned, to, support, human, life, averroes, cited, the, sun, the, moon, the, rivers, the, seas, and, the, location, of, humans, on, the, earth, according, to, him, this, suggests, a, creator, who, created, them, for, the, welfare, of, mankind, the, argument, from, invention, contends, that, worldly, entities, such, as, animals, and, plants, appear, to, have, been, invented, therefore, averroes, argues, that, a, designer, was, behind, the, creation, and, that, is, god, averroes, s, two, arguments, are, teleological, in, nature, and, not, cosmological, like, the, arguments, of, aristotle, and, most, contemporaneous, muslim, kalam, theologians, averroes, upholds, the, doctrine, of, divine, unity, tawhid, and, argues, that, god, has, seven, divine, attributes, knowledge, life, power, will, hearing, vision, and, speech, he, devotes, the, most, attention, to, the, attribute, of, knowledge, and, argues, that, divine, knowledge, differs, from, human, knowledge, because, god, knows, the, universe, because, god, is, its, cause, while, humans, only, know, the, universe, through, its, effects, averroes, argues, that, the, attribute, of, life, can, be, inferred, because, it, is, the, precondition, of, knowledge, and, also, because, god, willed, objects, into, being, power, can, be, inferred, by, god, s, ability, to, bring, creations, into, existence, averroes, also, argues, that, knowledge, and, power, inevitably, give, rise, to, speech, regarding, vision, and, speech, he, says, that, because, god, created, the, world, he, necessarily, knows, every, part, of, it, in, the, same, way, an, artist, understands, his, or, her, work, intimately, because, two, elements, of, the, world, are, the, visual, and, the, auditory, god, must, necessarily, possess, vision, and, speech, the, omnipotence, paradox, was, first, addressed, by, averroes, and, only, later, by, thomas, aquinas, in, the, centuries, preceding, averroes, there, had, been, a, debate, between, muslim, thinkers, questioning, whether, the, world, was, created, at, a, specific, moment, in, time, or, whether, it, has, always, existed, neo, platonic, philosophers, such, as, al, farabi, and, avicenna, argued, the, world, has, always, existed, this, view, was, criticized, by, the, mutakallimin, philosophers, and, theologians, of, the, ash, ari, tradition, in, particular, al, ghazali, wrote, an, extensive, refutation, of, the, pre, eternity, doctrine, in, his, the, incoherence, of, the, philosophers, and, accused, the, neoplatonists, of, unbelief, kufr, averroes, responded, to, al, ghazali, in, his, incoherence, of, the, incoherence, he, argued, first, that, the, differences, between, the, two, positions, were, not, vast, enough, to, warrant, the, charge, of, unbelief, he, also, said, the, pre, eternity, doctrine, did, not, necessarily, contradict, the, quran, and, cited, verses, that, mention, pre, existing, throne, and, water, in, passages, related, to, creation, averroes, argued, that, a, careful, reading, of, the, quran, implied, only, the, form, of, the, universe, was, created, in, time, but, that, its, existence, has, been, eternal, averroes, further, criticized, the, mutakallimin, for, using, their, interpretations, of, scripture, to, answer, questions, that, should, have, been, left, to, philosophers, averroes, states, his, political, philosophy, in, his, commentary, of, plato, s, republic, he, combines, his, ideas, with, plato, s, and, with, islamic, tradition, he, considers, the, ideal, state, to, be, one, based, on, the, islamic, law, shariah, his, interpretation, of, plato, s, philosopher, king, followed, that, of, al, farabi, which, equates, the, philosopher, king, with, the, imam, caliph, and, lawgiver, of, the, state, averroes, s, description, of, the, characteristics, of, a, philosopher, king, are, similar, to, those, given, by, al, farabi, they, include, love, of, knowledge, good, memory, love, of, learning, love, of, truth, dislike, for, sensual, pleasures, dislike, for, amassing, wealth, magnanimity, courage, steadfastness, eloquence, and, the, ability, to, light, quickly, on, the, middle, term, averroes, writes, that, if, philosophers, cannot, rule, as, was, the, case, in, the, almoravid, and, almohad, empires, around, his, lifetime, philosophers, must, still, try, to, influence, the, rulers, towards, implementing, the, ideal, state, according, to, averroes, there, are, two, methods, of, teaching, virtue, to, citizens, persuasion, and, coercion, persuasion, is, the, more, natural, method, consisting, of, rhetorical, dialectical, and, demonstrative, methods, sometimes, however, coercion, is, necessary, for, those, not, amenable, to, persuasion, e, g, enemies, of, the, state, therefore, he, justifies, war, as, a, last, resort, which, he, also, supports, using, quranic, arguments, consequently, he, argues, that, a, ruler, should, have, both, wisdom, and, courage, which, are, needed, for, governance, and, defense, of, the, state, like, plato, averroes, calls, for, women, to, share, with, men, in, the, administration, of, the, state, including, participating, as, soldiers, philosophers, and, rulers, he, regrets, that, contemporaneous, muslim, societies, limited, the, public, role, of, women, he, says, this, limitation, is, harmful, to, the, state, s, well, being, averroes, also, accepted, plato, s, ideas, of, the, deterioration, of, the, ideal, state, he, cites, examples, from, islamic, history, when, the, rashidun, caliphate, which, in, sunni, tradition, represented, the, ideal, state, led, by, rightly, guided, caliphs, became, a, dynastic, state, under, muawiyah, founder, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, he, also, says, the, almoravid, and, the, almohad, empires, started, as, ideal, shariah, based, states, but, then, deteriorated, into, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and, tyranny, in, his, tenure, as, judge, and, jurist, averroes, for, the, most, part, ruled, and, gave, fatwas, according, to, the, maliki, school, of, islamic, law, which, was, dominant, in, al, andalus, and, the, western, islamic, world, during, his, time, however, he, frequently, acted, as, his, own, man, including, sometimes, rejecting, the, consensus, of, the, people, of, medina, argument, that, is, one, of, the, traditional, maliki, position, in, bid, yat, al, mujtahid, one, of, his, major, contributions, to, the, field, of, islamic, law, he, not, only, describes, the, differences, between, various, school, of, islamic, laws, but, also, tries, to, theoretically, explain, the, reasons, for, the, difference, and, why, they, are, inevitable, even, though, all, the, schools, of, islamic, law, are, ultimately, rooted, in, the, quran, and, hadith, there, are, causes, that, necessitate, differences, al, asbab, al, lati, awjabat, al, ikhtilaf, they, include, differences, in, interpreting, scripture, in, a, general, or, specific, sense, in, interpreting, scriptural, commands, as, obligatory, or, merely, recommended, or, prohibitions, as, discouragement, or, total, prohibition, as, well, as, ambiguities, in, the, meaning, of, words, or, expressions, averroes, also, writes, that, the, application, of, qiyas, reasoning, by, analogy, could, give, rise, to, different, legal, opinion, because, jurists, might, disagree, on, the, applicability, of, certain, analogies, and, different, analogies, might, contradict, each, other, as, did, avempace, and, ibn, tufail, averroes, criticizes, the, ptolemaic, system, using, philosophical, arguments, and, rejects, the, use, of, eccentrics, and, epicycles, to, explain, the, apparent, motions, of, the, moon, the, sun, and, the, planets, he, argued, that, those, objects, move, uniformly, in, a, strictly, circular, motion, around, the, earth, following, aristotelian, principles, he, postulates, that, there, are, three, type, of, planetary, motions, those, that, can, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, those, that, requires, instruments, to, observe, and, those, that, can, only, be, known, by, philosophical, reasoning, averroes, argues, that, the, occasional, opaque, colors, of, the, moon, are, caused, by, variations, in, its, thickness, the, thicker, parts, receive, more, light, from, the, sun, and, therefore, emit, more, light, than, the, thinner, parts, this, explanation, was, used, up, to, the, seventeenth, century, by, the, european, scholastics, to, account, for, galileo, s, observations, of, spots, on, the, moon, s, surface, until, the, scholastics, such, as, antoine, goudin, in, 1668, conceded, that, the, observation, was, more, likely, caused, by, mountains, on, the, moon, he, and, ibn, bajja, observed, sunspots, which, they, thought, were, transits, of, venus, and, mercury, between, the, sun, and, the, earth, in, 1153, he, conducted, astronomical, observations, in, marrakesh, where, he, observed, the, star, canopus, arabic, suhayl, which, was, invisible, in, the, latitude, of, his, native, spain, he, used, this, observation, to, support, aristotle, s, argument, for, the, spherical, earth, averroes, was, aware, that, arabic, and, andalusian, astronomers, of, his, time, focused, on, mathematical, astronomy, which, enabled, accurate, predictions, through, calculations, but, did, not, provide, a, detailed, physical, explanation, of, how, the, universe, worked, according, to, him, the, astronomy, of, our, time, offers, no, truth, but, only, agrees, with, the, calculations, and, not, with, what, exists, he, attempted, to, reform, astronomy, to, be, reconciled, with, physics, especially, the, physics, of, aristotle, his, long, commentary, of, aristotle, s, metaphysics, describes, the, principles, of, his, attempted, reform, but, later, in, his, life, he, declared, that, his, attempts, had, failed, he, confessed, that, he, had, not, enough, time, or, knowledge, to, reconcile, the, observed, planetary, motions, with, aristotelian, principles, in, addition, he, did, not, know, the, works, of, eudoxus, and, callippus, and, so, he, missed, the, context, of, some, of, aristotle, s, astronomical, works, however, his, works, influenced, astronomer, nur, ad, din, al, bitruji, d, 1204, who, adopted, most, of, his, reform, principles, and, did, succeed, in, proposing, an, early, astronomical, system, based, on, aristotelian, physics, in, physics, averroes, did, not, adopt, the, inductive, method, that, was, being, developed, by, al, biruni, in, the, islamic, world, and, is, closer, to, today, s, physics, rather, he, was, in, the, words, of, historian, of, science, ruth, glasner, an, exegetical, scientist, who, produced, new, theses, about, nature, through, discussions, of, previous, texts, especially, the, writings, of, aristotle, because, of, this, approach, he, was, often, depicted, as, an, unimaginative, follower, of, aristotle, but, glasner, argues, that, averroes, s, work, introduced, highly, original, theories, of, physics, especially, his, elaboration, of, aristotle, s, minima, naturalia, and, on, motion, as, forma, fluens, which, were, taken, up, in, the, west, and, are, important, to, the, overall, development, of, physics, averroes, expounds, his, thoughts, on, psychology, in, his, three, commentaries, on, aristotle, s, on, the, soul, averroes, is, interested, in, explaining, the, human, intellect, using, philosophical, methods, and, by, interpreting, aristotle, s, ideas, his, position, on, the, topic, changed, throughout, his, career, as, his, thoughts, developed, in, his, short, commentary, the, first, of, the, three, works, averroes, follows, ibn, bajja, s, theory, that, something, called, the, material, intellect, stores, specific, images, that, a, person, encounters, these, images, serve, as, basis, for, the, unification, by, the, universal, agent, intellect, which, once, it, happens, allow, a, person, to, gain, universal, knowledge, about, that, concept, in, his, middle, commentary, averroes, moves, towards, the, ideas, of, al, farabi, and, avicenna, saying, the, agent, intellect, gives, humans, the, power, of, universal, understanding, which, is, the, material, intellect, once, the, person, has, sufficient, empirical, encounters, with, a, certain, concept, the, power, activates, and, gives, the, person, universal, knowledge, see, also, logical, induction, in, his, last, commentary, called, the, long, commentary, he, proposes, another, theory, which, becomes, known, as, the, theory, of, the, unity, of, the, intellect, in, it, averroes, argues, that, there, is, only, one, material, intellect, which, is, the, same, for, all, humans, and, is, unmixed, with, human, body, to, explain, how, different, individuals, can, have, different, thoughts, he, uses, a, concept, he, calls, fikr, known, as, cogitatio, in, latin, a, process, that, happens, in, human, brains, and, contains, not, universal, knowledge, but, active, consideration, of, particular, things, the, person, has, encountered, this, theory, attracted, controversy, when, averroes, s, works, entered, christian, europe, in, 1229, thomas, aquinas, wrote, a, detailed, critique, titled, on, the, unity, of, the, intellect, against, the, averroists, while, his, works, in, medicine, indicate, an, in, depth, theoretical, knowledge, in, medicine, of, his, time, he, likely, had, limited, expertise, as, a, practitioner, and, declared, in, one, of, his, works, that, he, had, not, practiced, much, apart, from, myself, my, relatives, or, my, friends, he, did, serve, as, a, royal, physician, but, his, qualification, and, education, was, mostly, theoretical, for, the, most, part, averroes, s, medical, work, al, kulliyat, fi, al, tibb, follows, the, medical, doctrine, of, galen, an, influential, greek, physician, and, author, from, the, second, century, which, was, based, on, the, four, humors, blood, yellow, bile, black, bile, and, phlegm, whose, balance, is, necessary, for, the, health, of, the, human, body, averroes, s, original, contributions, include, his, observations, on, the, retina, he, might, have, been, the, first, to, recognize, that, retina, was, the, part, of, the, eye, responsible, for, sensing, light, rather, than, the, lens, as, was, commonly, thought, modern, scholars, dispute, whether, this, is, what, he, meant, it, his, kulliyat, but, averroes, also, stated, a, similar, observation, in, his, commentary, to, aristotle, s, sense, and, sensibilia, the, innermost, of, the, coats, of, the, eye, must, necessarily, receive, the, light, from, the, humors, of, the, eye, just, like, the, humors, receive, the, light, from, air, another, of, his, departure, from, galen, and, the, medical, theories, of, the, time, is, his, description, of, stroke, as, produced, by, the, brain, and, caused, by, an, obstruction, of, the, arteries, from, the, heart, to, the, brain, this, explanation, is, closer, to, the, modern, understanding, of, the, disease, compared, to, that, of, galen, which, attributes, it, to, the, obstruction, between, heart, and, the, periphery, he, was, also, the, first, to, describe, the, signs, and, symptoms, of, parkinson, s, disease, in, his, kulliyat, although, he, did, not, give, the, disease, a, name, maimonides, d, 1204, was, among, early, jewish, scholars, who, received, averroes, s, works, enthusiastically, saying, he, received, lately, everything, averroes, had, written, on, the, works, of, aristotle, and, that, averroes, was, extremely, right, thirteenth, century, jewish, writers, including, samuel, ibn, tibbon, in, his, work, opinion, of, the, philosophers, judah, ben, solomon, ha, kohen, in, his, search, for, wisdom, and, shem, tov, ibn, falaquera, relied, heavily, on, averroes, s, texts, in, 1232, joseph, ibn, kaspi, translated, averroes, s, commentaries, on, aristotle, s, organon, this, was, the, first, jewish, translation, of, a, complete, work, in, 1260, moses, ibn, tibbon, published, the, translation, of, almost, all, of, averroes, s, commentaries, and, some, of, his, medical, works, jewish, averroism, peaked, in, the, fourteenth, century, jewish, writers, of, this, time, who, translated, or, were, influenced, by, averroes, include, kalonymus, ben, kalonymus, of, arles, france, todros, todrosi, of, arles, elia, del, medigo, of, candia, and, gersonides, of, languedoc, averroes, s, main, influence, on, the, christian, west, was, through, his, extensive, commentaries, on, aristotle, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, western, europe, fell, into, a, cultural, decline, that, resulted, in, the, loss, of, nearly, all, of, the, intellectual, legacy, of, the, classical, greek, scholars, including, aristotle, averroes, s, commentaries, which, were, translated, into, latin, and, entered, western, europe, in, the, thirteenth, century, provided, an, expert, account, of, aristotle, s, legacy, and, made, them, available, again, the, influence, of, his, commentaries, led, to, averroes, being, referred, to, simply, as, the, commentator, rather, than, by, name, in, latin, christian, writings, he, has, been, sometimes, described, as, the, father, of, free, thought, and, unbelief, and, father, of, rationalism, michael, scot, 1175, c, 1232, was, the, first, latin, translator, of, averroes, who, translated, the, long, commentaries, of, physics, metaphysics, on, the, soul, and, on, the, heavens, as, well, as, multiple, middle, and, short, commentaries, starting, in, 1217, in, paris, and, toledo, following, this, european, authors, such, as, hermannus, alemannus, william, de, luna, and, armengaud, of, montpellier, translated, averroes, s, other, works, sometimes, with, help, from, jewish, authors, soon, after, averroes, s, works, propagated, among, christian, scholars, in, the, scholastic, tradition, his, writing, attracted, a, strong, circle, of, followers, known, as, the, latin, averroists, paris, and, padua, were, major, centers, of, latin, averroism, and, its, prominent, thirteenth, century, leaders, included, siger, of, brabant, and, boethius, of, dacia, authorities, of, the, roman, catholic, church, reacted, against, the, spread, of, averroism, in, 1270, the, bishop, of, paris, tienne, tempier, issued, a, condemnation, against, 15, doctrines, many, of, which, were, aristotelian, or, averroist, that, he, said, were, in, conflict, with, the, doctrines, of, the, church, in, 1277, at, the, request, of, pope, john, xxi, tempier, issued, another, condemnation, this, time, targeting, 219, theses, drawn, from, many, sources, mainly, the, teachings, of, aristotle, and, averroes, averroes, received, a, mixed, reception, from, other, catholic, thinkers, thomas, aquinas, a, leading, catholic, thinker, of, the, thirteenth, century, relied, extensively, on, averroes, s, interpretation, of, aristotle, but, disagreed, with, him, on, many, points, for, example, he, wrote, a, detailed, attack, on, averroes, s, theory, that, all, humans, share, the, same, intellect, he, also, opposed, averroes, on, the, eternity, of, the, universe, and, divine, providence, the, catholic, church, s, condemnations, of, 1270, and, 1277, and, the, detailed, critique, by, aquinas, weakened, the, spread, of, averroism, in, latin, christendom, though, it, maintained, a, following, until, the, sixteenth, century, when, european, thought, began, to, diverge, from, aristotelianism, leading, averroists, in, the, following, centuries, included, john, of, jandun, and, marsilius, of, padua, fourteenth, century, gaetano, da, thiene, and, pietro, pomponazzi, fifteenth, century, and, agostino, nifo, and, marcantonio, zimara, sixteenth, century, averroes, had, no, major, influence, on, islamic, philosophic, thought, until, modern, times, part, of, the, reason, was, geography, averroes, lived, in, spain, the, extreme, west, of, the, islamic, civilization, far, from, the, centers, of, islamic, intellectual, traditions, also, his, philosophy, may, not, have, appealed, to, islamic, scholars, of, his, time, his, focus, on, aristotle, s, works, was, outdated, in, the, twelfth, century, muslim, world, which, had, already, scrutinized, aristotle, since, the, ninth, century, and, by, now, was, engaging, deeply, with, newer, schools, of, thought, especially, that, of, avicenna, in, the, nineteenth, century, muslim, thinkers, began, to, engage, with, the, works, of, averroes, again, by, this, time, there, was, a, cultural, renaissance, called, al, nahda, reawakening, in, the, arabic, speaking, world, and, the, works, of, averroes, were, seen, as, inspiration, to, modernize, the, muslim, intellectual, tradition, references, to, averroes, appear, in, the, popular, culture, of, both, the, western, and, muslim, world, the, poem, the, divine, comedy, by, the, italian, writer, dante, alighieri, completed, in, 1320, depicts,
