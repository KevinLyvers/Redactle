considered, to, have, the, highest, quality, color, printing, of, any, newspaper, at, the, time, its, printing, staff, used, the, ben, day, process, for, color, and, mccay, annotated, the, nemo, pages, with, precise, color, schemes, for, the, printers, impresario, f, f, proctor, approached, mccay, in, april, 1906, to, perform, chalk, talks, for, the, vaudeville, circuit, for, 500, per, week,

and, mccay, toured, with, the, show, throughout, 1907, while, managing, to, complete, his, comic, strip, and, illustration, work, on, time, often, working, in, hotel, rooms, or, backstage, as, early,

in, several, cities, mccay, brought, his, son, who, as, publicity, sat, on, a, small, throne, dressed, as, nemo, as, part, of, an, improvised, story, cawthorn, introduced, a, mythical, creature, he, called, a, whiffenpoof, the, word, caught, on, with, the, public, and, became, the, name, of, a, hit, song, and, a, singing, group, despite, the, show, s, success, it, failed, to, make, back, its, investment, due, to, its, enormous, expenses, and, came, to, an, end, in, december, 1910, mccay, displayed, his, social, awareness, in, the, last, strip, he, created, for, the, herald, poor, jake,

in, early, 1910, to, bring, his, vaudeville, show, to, europe, mccay, requested, the, herald, s, permission, but, the, plans, never, materialized, his, show, stayed, within, the, eastern, united, states, until, he, ceased, performing, in, 1917, biographer, john, canemaker, assumed, mccay, s, request, to, tour, europe, was, turned, down, and, that, the, refusal, added, to, mccay, s, growing, frustration, with, the, herald, a, distrust, of, big, business, became, pronounced, in, mccay, s, work, around, this, time, including, a, story, arc, in, little, nemo, in, which, the, characters, visit, a, mars, oppressed, by, a, greedy, business, magnate, mccay, said, he, was, most, proud, of, his, animation, work, he, completed, ten, animated, films, between, 1911, and, 1921, and, three, more, were, planned, inspired, by, the, flip, books, his, son, brought, home, mccay, came, to, see, the, possibility, of, making, moving, pictures, of, his, cartoons, he, claimed, to, be, the, first, man, in, the, world, to, make, animated, cartoons, though, he, was, preceded, by, others, such, as, james, stuart, blackton, and, mile, cohl, mccay, made, four, thousand, drawings, on, rice, paper, for, his, first, animated, short, which, starred, his, little, nemo, characters, they, were, shot, at, vitagraph, studios, under, blackton, s, supervision, live, action, sequences, were, added, to, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, film, in, which, mccay, bets, his, newspaper, colleagues, that, in, one, month, he, can, make, four, thousand, drawings, that, move, among, those, featured, in, these, sequences, were, cartoonist, george, mcmanus, and, actor, john, bunny, little, nemo, debuted, in, movie, theatres, on, april, 8, 1911, and, four, days, later, mccay, began, using, it, as, part, of, his, vaudeville, act, its, good, reception, motivated, him, to, hand, color, each, of, the, frames, of, the, originally, black, and, white, animation, mccay, had, become, frustrated, with, the, herald, partly, over, money, issues, and, partly, because, he, perceived, a, lack, of, freedom, he, accepted, a, higher, paying, offer, in, spring, 1911, from, hearst, at, the, new, york, american, and, took, little, nemo, s, characters, with, him, the, herald, held, the, strip, s, copyright, but, mccay, won, a, lawsuit, that, allowed, him, to, continue, using, the, characters, which, he, did, under, the, title, in, the, land, of, wonderful, dreams, the, herald, was, unsuccessful, in, finding, another, cartoonist, to, continue, the, original, strip, mccay, began, work, that, may, on, his, next, animated, film, how, a, mosquito, operates, based, on, a, rarebit, fiend, episode, from, june, 5, 1909, in, which, a, man, in, bed, tries, in, vain, to, defend, himself, from, a, giant, mosquito, which, drinks, itself, so, full, that, it, explodes, the, animation, is, naturalistic, rather, than, expanding, like, a, balloon, with, each, sip, of, blood, the, mosquito, s, abdomen, swells, according, to, its, body, structure, the, film, was, completed, in, january, 1912, and, mccay, toured, with, it, that, spring, and, summer, gertie, the, dinosaur, debuted, in, february, 1914, as, part, of, mccay, s, vaudeville, act, mccay, introduced, gertie, as, the, only, dinosaur, in, captivity, and, commanded, the, animated, beast, with, a, whip, gertie, seemed, to, obey, mccay, bowing, to, the, audience, and, eating, a, tree, and, a, boulder, though, she, had, a, will, of, her, own, and, sometimes, rebelled, when, mccay, admonished, her, she, cried, mccay, consoled, her, by, throwing, her, an, apple, in, reality, pocketing, the, cardboard, prop, apple, as, a, cartoon, one, simultaneously, appeared, on, screen, in, the, finale, mccay, walked, offstage, reappeared, in, animated, form, in, the, film, and, had, gertie, carry, him, away, producer, william, fox, s, box, office, attractions, obtained, distribution, rights, to, a, modified, version, of, gertie, that, could, be, played, in, regular, movie, theaters, this, version, was, prefaced, with, a, live, action, sequence, and, replaced, the, interactive, portions, with, intertitles, gertie, was, mccay, s, first, piece, of, animation, with, detailed, backgrounds, mccay, drew, the, foreground, characters, while, art, student, neighbor, john, a, fitzsimmons, traced, the, backgrounds, mccay, pioneered, the, mccay, split, system, of, inbetweening, in, which, major, poses, or, positions, were, drawn, first, and, the, intervening, frames, drawn, after, this, relieved, tedium, and, improved, the, timing, of, the, film, s, actions, mccay, refused, to, patent, his, system, and, was, sued, in, 1914, by, animator, john, randolph, bray, who, took, advantage, of, mccay, s, lapse, by, patenting, many, of, mccay, s, techniques, including, the, use, of, registration, marks, tracing, paper, the, mutoscope, action, viewer, and, the, cycling, of, drawings, to, create, repetitive, action, the, lawsuit, was, unsuccessful, and, there, is, evidence, that, mccay, may, have, countersued, he, thereafter, received, royalty, payments, from, bray, for, licensing, the, techniques, hearst, was, disappointed, with, the, quality, of, mccay, s, newspaper, work, infuriated, that, he, couldn, t, reach, mccay, during, a, vaudeville, performance, hearst, pulled, from, his, papers, advertising, for, the, theatre, where, mccay, performed, editor, arthur, brisbane, told, him, that, he, was, a, serious, artist, not, a, comic, cartoonist, and, that, he, was, to, give, up, his, comic, strip, work, to, focus, on, editorial, illustrations, hearst, pressured, mccay, s, agents, to, reduce, the, number, of, his, vaudeville, appearances, and, he, was, induced, to, sign, a, contract, with, hearst, that, limited, his, vaudeville, appearances, to, greater, new, york, with, occasional, exceptions, in, february, 1917, hearst, had, mccay, give, up, entirely, on, vaudeville, and, all, other, paid, work, outside, the, hearst, empire, though, he, was, occasionally, granted, permission, for, particular, shows, hearst, increased, mccay, s, salary, to, cover, the, loss, of, income, mccay, was, expected, to, report, daily, to, the, american, building, where, he, shared, a, ninth, floor, office, with, humorist, arthur, bugs, baer, and, sports, cartoonist, joe, mcgurk, there, he, illustrated, editorials, by, arthur, brisbane, who, often, sent, back, mccay, s, drawings, with, instructions, for, changes, the, quality, of, his, drawings, varied, depending, on, his, interest, in, the, subject, of, the, assignment, whether, or, not, he, agreed, with, the, sentiments, portrayed, and, on, events, in, his, personal, life, for, example, in, march, 1914, he, was, subjected, to, a, blackmail, plot, by, a, mrs, lambkin, who, was, seeking, a, divorce, from, her, husband, lambkin, alleged, that, mccay, s, wife, maude, was, seeing, her, husband, with, mccay, s, level, of, fame, such, a, story, would, likely, be, in, the, papers, and, mrs, lambkin, and, her, husband, told, mccay, that, she, would, keep, it, secret, for, 1, 000, mccay, did, not, believe, the, allegations, and, gave, testimony, at, the, lambkins, divorce, trial, the, blackmail, failed, and, the, divorce, was, not, granted, hearst, animation, studio, international, film, service, began, in, december, 1915, and, brought, hearst, cartoonists, to, the, screen, mccay, was, initially, listed, as, one, of, them, but, the, studio, never, produced, anything, either, by, his, hands, or, featuring, his, creations, mccay, derived, satisfaction, from, doing, the, work, himself, begun, in, 1916, the, sinking, of, the, lusitania, was, his, follow, up, to, gertie, the, film, was, not, a, fantasy, but, a, detailed, realistic, recreation, of, the, 1915, german, torpedoing, of, the, rms, lusitania, the, event, counted, 128, americans, among, its, 1, 198, dead, and, was, a, factor, leading, to, the, american, entry, into, world, war, i, mccay, s, daughter, marion, married, military, man, raymond, t, moniz, eighteen, years, her, senior, on, october, 13, 1917, she, gave, birth, to, mccay, s, first, grandchild, ray, winsor, moniz, on, july, 16, 1918, moniz, and, mccay, s, son, robert, were, called, up, for, service, when, the, u, s, entered, world, war, i, mccay, s, self, financed, lusitania, took, nearly, two, years, to, complete, with, the, assistance, of, john, fitzsimmons, and, cincinnati, cartoonist, william, apthorp, ap, adams, mccay, spent, his, off, hours, drawing, the, film, on, sheets, of, cellulose, acetate, or, cels, with, white, and, black, india, ink, at, mccay, s, home, it, was, the, first, film, mccay, made, using, cels, a, technology, animator, earl, hurd, had, patented, in, 1914, it, saved, work, by, allowing, dynamic, drawings, to, be, made, on, one, or, more, layers, which, could, be, laid, over, a, static, background, layer, relieving, animators, of, the, tedium, of, retracing, static, images, onto, drawing, after, drawing, mccay, had, the, cels, photographed, at, the, vitagraph, studios, the, film, was, naturalistically, animated, and, made, use, of, dramatic, camera, angles, that, would, have, been, impossible, in, a, live, action, film, jewel, productions, released, the, film, on, july, 20, 1918, advertising, touted, it, as, the, picture, that, will, never, have, a, competitor, the, film, itself, called, mccay, the, originator, and, inventor, of, animated, cartoons, and, drew, attention, to, the, fact, that, it, took, 25, 000, drawings, to, complete, the, sinking, of, the, lusitania, did, not, greatly, return, on, mccay, s, investment, after, a, few, years, run, in, theaters, it, netted, 80, 000, mccay, continued, to, produce, animated, films, using, cels, by, 1921, he, had, completed, six, though, three, were, likely, never, shown, commercially, to, audiences, and, have, survived, only, in, fragments, the, centaurs, flip, s, circus, and, gertie, on, tour, in, 1921, he, released, three, films, based, on, dream, of, the, rarebit, fiend, bug, vaudeville, in, which, insects, and, other, creepy, crawlies, perform, on, stage, the, pet, in, which, a, creature, with, a, bottomless, appetite, grows, enormously, and, terrorizes, the, city, in, a, way, reminiscent, of, king, kong, and, the, flying, house, in, which, a, man, attaches, wings, to, his, house, to, flee, from, debt, mccay, s, son, robert, is, credited, with, the, animation, on, this, last, film, but, canemaker, notes, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, a, first, time, animator, could, have, produced, such, an, accomplished, piece, of, animation, after, 1921, mccay, was, made, to, give, up, on, animation, when, hearst, learned, he, devoted, more, of, his, time, to, animation, than, to, his, newspaper, illustrations, unexecuted, ideas, mccay, had, for, animation, projects, included, a, collaboration, with, jungle, imps, author, george, randolph, chester, a, musical, film, called, the, barnyard, band, and, a, film, about, the, americans, role, in, world, war, i, mccay, s, son, robert, married, theresa, tedda, munchausen, on, april, 9, 1921, mccay, bought, them, a, nearby, house, as, a, wedding, gift, the, couple, gave, mccay, two, more, grandchildren, janet, named, after, mccay, s, mother, in, 1922, and, robert, in, 1928, robert, suffered, shell, shock, during, world, war, i, and, following, the, war, had, difficulty, drawing, mccay, tried, to, boost, his, son, s, confidence, by, finding, him, cartooning, work, and, some, of, the, elder, mccay, s, editorial, cartoons, were, signed, robert, winsor, mccay, jr, robert, also, briefly, revived, the, dreams, of, the, rarebit, fiend, strip, as, rabid, reveries, starting, in, 1924, in, 1922, mccay, resumed, doing, vaudeville, shows, for, the, keith, circuit, he, had, a, cameo, in, a, newspaper, office, scene, in, the, boxing, film, the, great, white, way, in, early, 1924, mccay, left, hearst, upon, the, expiration, of, his, contract, in, may, 1924, bitter, over, not, having, received, a, promised, 5, 000, bonus, he, returned, to, the, herald, tribune, and, brought, back, little, nemo, beginning, that, august, the, new, strip, displayed, the, virtuoso, technique, of, the, old, but, the, panels, were, laid, out, in, an, unvarying, grid, nemo, took, a, more, passive, role, in, the, stories, and, there, was, no, continuity, the, strip, came, to, an, end, in, december, 1926, as, it, was, not, popular, with, readers, hearst, executives, had, been, trying, to, convince, mccay, to, return, to, the, american, and, succeeded, in, 1927, while, mccay, was, gone, his, place, had, been, filled, by, mel, cummin, who, was, let, go, after, mccay, s, return, due, to, the, lack, of, the, 1920s, nemo, s, success, the, herald, tribune, signed, over, all, copyrights, to, the, strip, to, mccay, for, one, dollar, in, 1927, mccay, attended, a, dinner, in, his, honor, in, new, york, after, a, considerable, amount, of, drinking, mccay, was, introduced, by, animator, max, fleischer, mccay, gave, the, gathered, group, of, animators, some, technical, advice, but, when, he, felt, the, audience, was, not, giving, him, attention, he, berated, his, audience, saying, animation, is, an, art, that, is, how, i, conceived, it, but, as, i, see, what, you, fellows, have, done, with, it, is, making, it, into, a, trade, not, an, art, but, a, trade, bad, luck, that, september, he, appeared, on, the, radio, at, wnac, and, on, november, 2, he, was, interviewed, by, frank, craven, for, the, evening, journal, s, woman, s, hour, during, both, appearances, he, complained, about, the, state, of, contemporary, animation, an, executive, of, the,

contract, didn, t, allow, outside, work, when, the, executive, stormed, into, brisbane, s, office, threatening, to, pull, american, tobacco, s, advertising, dollars, from, the, american, brisbane, provided, a, written, release, for, the, work, in, 1932, mccay, found, himself, in, what, he, recalled, as, the, wildest, ride, in, his, life, when, hearst, s, son, young, bill, drove, him, at, 85, miles, per, hour, 137, km, h, to, the, scene, of, the, kidnapping, of, the, lindbergh, baby, they, arrived, there, two, hours, after, the, crime, was, first, reported, to, police, and, were, able, to, interview, the, gathered, police, before, the, grounds, were, closed, off, to, the, public, mccay, sketched, the, scene, the, staff, and, the, ladders, the, kidnappers, used, which, he, was, allowed,

and, his, son, and, the, society, of, illustrators, among, others, brisbane, hired, back, mel, cummin, to, replace, mccay, due, to, his, lavish, life, style, mccay, left, a, smaller, fortune, than, those, around, him, had, expected, by, the, early, 1940s, maude, had, used, up, her, inheritance, and, sold, the, house, on, voorhies, avenue, when, she, died, of, a, heart, attack, on, march, 2,

three, daughters, of, french, canadian, carriage, painter, john, dufour, about, a, decade, separated, the, couple, s, ages, maude, was, 14, when, they, married, biographer, canemaker, speculates, this, may, explain, the, lack, of, certainty, behind, mccay, s, birthdate, even, by, mccay, himself, as, he, may, have, claimed, to, be, younger, than, he, was, to, justify, marrying, a, teenaged, girl, maude, was, also, age, conscious, she, preferred, her, grandchildren, to, call, her, nan, instead, of, grandma, and, dyed, her, hair, as, she, got, older, the, mccays, took, on, the,

the, existence, of, his, sister, mae, who, died, in, 1910, it, is, as, though, the, first, creature, to, emerge, from, the, primeval, slime, was, albert, einstein, and, the, second, was, an, amoeba, because, after, mccay, s, animation, it, took, his, followers, nearly, twenty, years, to, find, out, how, he, did, it, the, two, most, important, people, in, animation, are, winsor, mccay, and, walt,

off, some, of, the, artwork, when, they, were, in, need, of, cash, responsibility, for, it, passed, to, mendelsohn, then, later, to, daughter, marion, by, the, early, twenty, first, century, most, of, mccay, s, surviving, artwork, remained, in, family, hands, mccay, destroyed, many, of, his, original, cans, of, film, to, create, more, storage, space, of, what, film, he, kept, much, has, not,

intelligent, biography, ever, written, about, an, american, cartoonist, animation, scholar, paul, wells, stated, mccay, s, influence, on, the, history, of, animation, cannot, be, understated, film, critic, richard, eder, lamented, that, as, an, animation, pioneer, mccay, was, not, able, to, reach, the, potential, suggested, by, his, work, eder, compared, mccay, to, the, italian, primitives, of, the, early, renaissance, highly, skilled, in, the, limited, techniques, they, could, command, heer, wrote, that, mccay, s, strength, was, in, his, visuals, but, that, his, writing, and, characters, were, weak, italian, filmmaker, federico, fellini, read, little, nemo, in, the, children, s, magazine, il, corriere, dei, piccoli, and, the, strip, was, a, powerful, influence, on, the, filmmaker, according, to, fellini, biographer, peter, bondanella, comics, historian, r, c, harvey, has, called, mccay, the, first, original, genius, of, the, comic, strip, medium, and, in, animation, harvey, said, that, mccay, s, contemporaries, lacked, the, skill, to, continue, with, his, innovations, so, that, they, were, left, for, future, generations, to, rediscover, and, build, upon, mccay, s, work,

been, allotted, space, sufficient, for, his, expansive, full, page, fantasies, as, sigmund, freud, s, the, interpretation, of, dreams, first, appeared, in, print, in, 1899, mccay, s, major, dream, strips, work, have, invited, speculation, of, a, freudian, influence, but, it, can, be, proved, that, mccay, s, influence, at, least, in, a, secondhand, manner, reached, freud, hungarian, artist, n,

and, shape, of, comic, strip, panels, for, dramatic, effect, as, in, the, second, instalment, of, little, nemo, october, 22, 1905, where, the, panels, grow, to, adapt, to, a, growing, forest, of, mushrooms, few, of, mccay, s, contemporaries, were, so, bold, with, their, page, layouts, near, contemporary, george, herriman, with, krazy, kat, was, the, most, notable, example, but, it, was, not, until, a, generation, later, that, cartoonists, such, as, frank, king, with, gasoline, alley, hal, foster, with, prince, valiant, and, roy, crane, with, captain, easy, attempted, such, daring, designs, on, their, sunday, pages, mccay, s, detailed, hatching, and, mastery, of, perspective, enhanced, the, illusions, in, his, drawings, particularly, in, little, nemo, fantastic, grotesqueries, such, as, what, mccay, witnessed, during, his, time, at, the, wonderland, and, eden, musee, appeared, often, in, mccay, s, work, mccay, was, noted, for, the, speed, and, accuracy, with, which, he, could, draw, crowds, of, people, would, gather, around, to, watch, him, paint, billboards, mccay, had, a, taste, for, the, ornate, the, architecture, he, drew, was, inspired, by, that, of, carnivals,
