for, robert, marrying, her, guiscard, soon, rose, to, distinction, the, lombards, turned, against, their, erstwhile, allies, and, pope, leo, ix, determined, to, expel, the, norman, freebooters, his, army, was, defeated, however, at, the, battle, of, civitate, sul, fortore, in, 1053, by, the, normans, united, under, humphrey, humphrey, commanded, the, centre, against, the, pope, s, swabian,

married, sichelgaita, the, sister, of, gisulf, ii, of, salerno, and, daughter, guaimar, iv, in, return, for, giving, him, his, sister, s, hand, gisulf, demanded, that, guiscard, destroy, two, castles, of, his, brother, william, count, of, the, principate, which, had, encroached, on, gisulf, s, territory, this, secured, an, alliance, between, lombards, and, normans, and, opened, the, doors, of, aristocracy, to, the, hauteville, family, the, reformist, papacy, at, odds, with, the, holy, roman, emperor, due, to, the, investiture, controversy, and, the, roman, nobility, itself, resolved, to, recognize, the, normans, and, secure, them, as, allies, therefore, in, the, treaty, of, melfi, on, 23, august, 1059, pope, nicholas, ii, invested, guiscard, as, duke, of, apulia, calabria, and, sicily, guiscard, now, by, the, grace, of, god, and, st, peter, duke, of, apulia, and, calabria, and, if, either, aid, me, future, lord, of, sicily, agreed, to, hold, his, titles, and, lands, by,

of, the, opening, of, the, melfitan, council, in, june, guiscard, had, been, leading, an, army, in, calabria, this, was, the, first, strong, attempt, to, subjugate, the, province, still, held, by, the, byzantines, since, the, campaigns, of, william, iron, arm, and, guaimar, iv, after, attending, the, synod, for, his, investiture, guiscard, returned, to, calabria, where, his, army, was,

calabria, where, roger, was, waiting, with, siege, engines, the, fall, of, reggio, after, a, long, and, arduous, siege, and, the, subsequent, capitulation, of, scilla, an, island, citadel, to, which, the, reggian, garrison, had, fled, opened, up, the, way, to, sicily, roger, initially, led, a, tiny, force, to, attack, messina, but, he, was, easily, repulsed, by, the, saracen, garrison, the, large, invading, force, that, could, have, been, expected, did, not, materialise, because, guiscard, was, recalled, by, a, new, byzantine, army, sent, by, emperor, constantine, x, ravaging, apulia, in, january, 1061, melfi, itself, was, under, siege, and, roger, too, was, recalled, but, the, full, weight, of, guiscard, s, army, forced, the, byzantines, to, retreat, by, may, apulia, was, calm, messina, was, finally, conquered, in, 1061, with, comparable, ease, for, they, landed, unsighted, during, the, night, when, the, city, was, already, abandoned, and, surprised, the, saracen, army, this, success, gave, them, control, over, the, strait, of, messina, after, the, conquest, guiscard, immediately, fortified, the, city, and, allied, himself, with, ibn, al, timnah, the, emir, of, syracuse, against, ibn, al, hawas, the, emir, of, enna, at, the, time, called, castrogiovanni, the, armies, of, robert, roger, and, their, muslim, ally, marched, into, central, sicily, through, rometta, which, had, remained, loyal, to, al, timnah, they, passed, through, frazzan, and, the, pianura, di, maniace, where, george, maniakes, and, the, first, hautevilles, had, distinguished, themselves, 21, years, prior, guiscard, assaulted, the, town, of, centuripe, but, their, resistance, was, too, strong, and, he, moved, on, patern, fell, and, guiscard, brought, his, army, to, enna, a, formidable, fortress, the, saracens, sallied, forth, and, were, defeated, but, enna, itself, did, not, fall, guiscard, then, turned, back, leaving, a, fortress, at, san, marco, d, alunzio, named, after, his, first, stronghold, in, calabria, he, returned, to, apulia, with, sichelgaita, for, christmas, he, then, returned, to, sicily, in, 1064, but, he, bypassed, enna, going, straight, for,

through, a, later, campaign, palermo, finally, fell, the, rest, of, sicily, was, gradually, conquered, a, last, resistance, was, attempted, by, emir, benavert, who, lost, the, war, at, syracuse, in, 1086, the, last, muslim, holding, in, sicily, noto, fell, in, 1091, as, a, result, of, his, sicilian, campaign, guiscard, was, referred, to, as, black, shirt, robert, because, throughout, the, campaign, he, wore, elegant, clothing, with, imported, dyes, that, ran, together, resulting, in, black, clothing, before, conquering, palermo, robert, had, to, fight, against, the, byzantine, forces,

the, city, by, land, and, by, water, for, four, years, before, the, people, decided, to, surrender, he, though, did, repay, the, damages, done, by, the, siege, with, the, fall, of, bari, in, 1071, the, greeks, were, finally, ousted, from, southern, italy, and, robert, focused, himself, on, the, various, independent, lombard, principalities, that, still, held, a, significant, part, of, the, territory, the, first, target, was, the, principality, of, salerno, salerno, was, besieged, and, fell, in, december, 1076, but, gisulf, ii, guiscard, s, brother, in, law, abandoned, his, castle, with,

of, naples, and, the, principality, of, benevento, robert, decided, to, attack, and, take, benevento, in, 1078, and, pope, gregory, vii, was, alarmed, because, it, was, considered, a, feud, of, the, holy, see, however, the, pope, didn, t, want, to, enter, in, conflict, with, the, normans, as, he, already, was, busy, with, emperor, henry, iv, due, to, the, investiture, controversy, question, an, alliance, between, guiscard, and, the, pope, was, negotiated, by, simon, de, cr, py, and, in, june, 1080, the, pope, confirmed, guiscard, s, claim, on, the, southern, abruzzi, on, the, march, of,

guiscard, mounted, an, attack, on, the, byzantine, empire, taking, up, the, cause, of, raiktor, a, monk, pretending, to, be, michael, vii, who, had, been, deposed, in, 1078, robert, believed, he, had, the, right, to, rule, in, the, empire, because, constantine, michael, vii, s, son, had, been, proposed, to, his, daughter, olympias, it, was, then, clear, that, raiktor, was, not, in, fact, michael, but, this, still, was, an, opportunity, guiscard, could, not, resist, he, sailed, with, an, army, of, norman, and, lombard, conscripts, from, all, parts, of, his, territories, 1, 300, knights,

of, sicily, his, successes, had, been, due, not, only, to, his, great, qualities, but, to, the, entente, with, the, papal, see, he, created, and, enforced, a, strong, ducal, power, which, was, nevertheless, met, by, many, baronial, revolts, including, one, in, 1078, when, he, demanded, from, the, apulian, vassals, an, aid, on, the, betrothal, of, his, daughter, in, conquering, such, wide,
