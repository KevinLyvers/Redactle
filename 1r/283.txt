dynasty, and, elizabeth, i, he, is, recognized, as, one, of, the, premier, craftsmen, of, nascent, modern, english, verse, and, he, is, considered, one, of, the, great, poets, in, the, english, language, edmund, spenser, was, born, in, east, smithfield, london, around, the, year, 1552, however, there, is, still, some, ambiguity, as, to, the, exact, date, of, his, birth, his, parenthood, is, obscure, but, he, was, probably, the, son, of, john, spenser, a, journeyman, clothmaker, as, a, young, boy, he, was, educated, in, london, at, the, merchant, taylors, school, and, matriculated, as, a, sizar, at, pembroke, college, cambridge, while, at, cambridge, he, became, a, friend, of, gabriel, harvey, and, later, consulted, him, despite, their, differing, views, on, poetry, in, 1578, he, became, for, a, short, time, secretary, to, john, young, bishop, of, rochester, in, 1579, he, published, the, shepheardes, calender, and, around, the, same, time, married, his, first, wife, machabyas,

the, river, blackwater, in, north, cork, its, ruins, are, still, visible, today, a, short, distance, away, grew, a, tree, locally, known, as, spenser, s, oak, until, it, was, destroyed, in, a, lightning, strike, in, the, 1960s, local, legend, claims, that, he, penned, some, of, the, faerie, queene, under, this, tree, in, 1590, spenser, brought, out, the, first, three, books, of, his, most, famous, work, the, faerie, queene, having, travelled, to, london, to, publish, and, promote, the, work, with, the, likely, assistance, of, raleigh, he, was, successful, enough, to, obtain, a, life, pension, of, 50, a, year, from, the, queen, he, probably, hoped, to, secure, a, place, at, court, through, his, poetry, but, his, next, significant, publication, boldly, antagonised, the, queen, s, principal, secretary, lord, burghley, william, cecil, through, its, inclusion, of, the, satirical, mother, hubberd, s, tale, he, returned, to, ireland, he, was, at, the, centre, of, a, literary, circle, whose, members, included, his, lifelong, friend, lodowick, bryskett, and, dr, john, longe, archbishop, of, armagh, in, 1591, spenser, published, a, translation, in, verse, of, joachim, du, bellay, s, sonnets, les, antiquit, s, de, rome, which, had, been, published, in, 1558, spenser, s, version, ruines, of, rome, by, bellay, may, also, have, been, influenced, by, latin, poems, on, the, same, subject, written, by, jean, or, janis, vitalis, and, published, in, 1576, by, 1594, spenser, s, first, wife, had, died, and, in, that, year, he, married, a, much, younger, elizabeth, boyle, a, relative, of, richard, boyle, 1st, earl, of, cork, he, addressed, to, her, the, sonnet, sequence, amoretti, the, marriage, was, celebrated, in, epithalamion, they, had, a, son, named, peregrine, in, 1596, spenser, wrote, a, prose, pamphlet, titled, a, view, of, the, present, state, of, irelande, this, piece, in, the, form, of, a, dialogue, circulated, in, manuscript, remaining, unpublished, until, the, mid, 17th, century, it, is, probable, that, it, was, kept, out, of, print, during, the, author, s, lifetime, because, of, its, inflammatory, content, the, pamphlet, argued, that, ireland, would, never, be, totally, pacified, by, the, english, until, its, indigenous, language, and, customs, had, been, destroyed, if, necessary, by, violence, in, 1598, during, the, nine, years, war, spenser, was, driven, from, his, home, by, the, native, irish, forces, of, aodh, n, ill, his, castle, at, kilcolman, was, burned, and, ben, jonson, who, may, have, had, private, information, asserted, that, one, of, his, infant, children, died, in, the, blaze, in, the, year, after, being, driven, from, his, home, 1599, spenser, travelled, to, london, where, he, died, at, the, age, of, forty, six, for, want, of, bread, according, to, ben, jonson, one, of, jonson, s, more, doubtful, statements, since, spenser, had, a, payment, to, him, authorised, by, the, government, and, was, due, his, pension, his, coffin, was, carried, to, his, grave, deliberately, near, that, of, geoffrey, chaucer, in, what, became, known, as, poets, corner, in, westminster, abbey, by, other, poets, probably, including, shakespeare, who, threw, many, pens, and, pieces, of, poetry, into, his, grave, his, second, wife, survived, him, and, remarried, twice, his, sister, sarah, who, had, accompanied, him, to, ireland, married, into, the, travers, family, and, her, descendants, were, prominent, landowners, in, cork, for, centuries, thomas, fuller, in, worthies, of, england, included, a, story, where, the, queen, told, her, treasurer, william, cecil, to, pay, spenser, 100, for, his, poetry, the, treasurer, however, objected, that, the, sum, was, too, much, she, said, then, give, him, what, is, reason, without, receiving, his, payment, in, due, time, spenser, gave, the, queen, this, quatrain, on, one, of, her, progresses, i, was, promis, d, on, a, time, to, have, a, reason, for, my, rhyme, from, that, time, unto, this, season, i, receiv, d, nor, rhyme, nor, reason, she, immediately, ordered, the, treasurer, to, pay, spenser, the, original, 100, this, story, seems, to, have, attached, itself, to, spenser, from, thomas, churchyard, who, apparently, had, difficulty, in, getting, payment, of, his, pension, the, only, other, pension, elizabeth, awarded, to, a, poet, spenser, seems, to, have, had, no, difficulty, in, receiving, payment, when, it, was, due, as, the, pension, was, being, collected, for, him, by, his, publisher, ponsonby, the, shepheardes, calender, is, edmund, spenser, s, first, major, work, which, appeared, in, 1579, it, emulates, virgil, s, eclogues, of, the, first, century, bce, and, the, eclogues, of, mantuan, by, baptista, mantuanus, a, late, medieval, early, renaissance, poet, an, eclogue, is, a, short, pastoral, poem, that, is, in, the, form, of, a, dialogue, or, soliloquy, although, all, the, months, together, form, an, entire, year, each, month, stands, alone, as, a, separate, poem, editions, of, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, include, woodcuts, for, each, month, poem, and, thereby, have, a, slight, similarity, to, an, emblem, book, which, combines, a, number, of, self, contained, pictures, and, texts, usually, a, short, vignette, saying, or, allegory, with, an, accompanying, illustration, spenser, s, masterpiece, is, the, epic, poem, the, faerie, queene, the, first, three, books, of, the, faerie, queene, were, published, in, 1590, and, the, second, set, of, three, books, was, published, in, 1596, spenser, originally, indicated, that, he, intended, the, poem, to, consist, of, twelve, books, so, the, version, of, the, poem, we, have, today, is, incomplete, despite, this, it, remains, one, of, the, longest, poems, in, the, english, language, it, is, an, allegorical, work, and, can, be, read, as, spenser, presumably, intended, on, several, levels, of, allegory, including, as, praise, of, queen, elizabeth, i, in, a, completely, allegorical, context, the, poem, follows, several, knights, in, an, examination, of, several, virtues, in, spenser, s, a, letter, of, the, authors, he, states, that, the, entire, epic, poem, is, cloudily, enwrapped, in, allegorical, devises, and, that, the, aim, behind, the, faerie, queene, was, to, fashion, a, gentleman, or, noble, person, in, virtuous, and, gentle, discipline, spenser, published, numerous, relatively, short, poems, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 16th, century, almost, all, of, which, consider, love, or, sorrow, in, 1591, he, published, complaints, a, collection, of, poems, that, express, complaints, in, mournful, or, mocking, tones, four, years, later, in, 1595, spenser, published, amoretti, and, epithalamion, this, volume, contains, eighty, eight, sonnets, commemorating, his, courtship, of, elizabeth, boyle, in, amoretti, spenser, uses, subtle, humour, and, parody, while, praising, his, beloved, reworking, petrarchism, in, his, treatment, of, longing, for, a, woman, epithalamion, similar, to, amoretti, deals, in, part, with, the, unease, in, the, development, of, a, romantic, and, sexual, relationship, it, was, written, for, his, wedding, to, his, young, bride, elizabeth, boyle, some, have, speculated, that, the, attention, to, disquiet, in, general, reflects, spenser, s, personal, anxieties, at, the, time, as, he, was, unable, to, complete, his, most, significant, work, the, faerie, queene, in, the, following, year, spenser, released, prothalamion, a, wedding, song, written, for, the, daughters, of, a, duke, allegedly, in, hopes, to, gain, favour, in, the, court, spenser, used, a, distinctive, verse, form, called, the, spenserian, stanza, in, several, works, including, the, faerie, queene, the, stanza, s, main, metre, is, iambic, pentameter, with, a, final, line, in, iambic, hexameter, having, six, feet, or, stresses, known, as, an, alexandrine, and, the, rhyme, scheme, is, ababbcbcc, he, also, used, his, own, rhyme, scheme, for, the, sonnet, in, a, spenserian, sonnet, the, last, line, of, every, quatrain, is, linked, with, the, first, line, of, the, next, one, yielding, the, rhyme, scheme, ababbcbccdcdee, men, call, you, fayre, is, a, fine, sonnet, from, amoretti, the, poet, presents, the, concept, of, true, beauty, in, the, poem, he, addresses, the, sonnet, to, his, beloved, elizabeth, boyle, and, presents, his, courtship, like, all, renaissance, men, edmund, spenser, believed, that, love, is, an, inexhaustible, source, of, beauty, and, order, in, this, sonnet, the, poet, expresses, his, idea, of, true, beauty, the, physical, beauty, will, finish, after, a, few, days, it, is, not, a, permanent, beauty, he, emphasises, beauty, of, mind, and, beauty, of, intellect, he, considers, his, beloved, is, not, simply, flesh, but, is, also, a, spiritual, being, the, poet, opines, that, he, is, beloved, born, of, heavenly, seed, and, she, is, derived, from, fair, spirit, the, poet, states, that, because, of, her, clean, mind, pure, heart, and, sharp, intellect, men, call, her, fair, and, she, deserves, it, at, the, end, the, poet, praises, her, spiritual, beauty, and, he, worships, her, because, of, her, divine, soul, though, spenser, was, well, read, in, classical, literature, scholars, have, noted, that, his, poetry, does, not, rehash, tradition, but, rather, is, distinctly, his, this, individuality, may, have, resulted, to, some, extent, from, a, lack, of, comprehension, of, the, classics, spenser, strove, to, emulate, such, ancient, roman, poets, as, virgil, and, ovid, whom, he, studied, during, his, schooling, but, many, of, his, best, known, works, are, notably, divergent, from, those, of, his, predecessors, the, language, of, his, poetry, is, purposely, archaic, reminiscent, of, earlier, works, such, as, the, canterbury, tales, of, geoffrey, chaucer, and, il, canzoniere, of, petrarch, whom, spenser, greatly, admired, an, anglican, and, a, devotee, of, the, protestant, queen, elizabeth, spenser, was, particularly, offended, by, the, anti, elizabethan, propaganda, that, some, catholics, circulated, like, most, protestants, near, the, time, of, the, reformation, spenser, saw, a, catholic, church, full, of, corruption, and, he, determined, that, it, was, not, only, the, wrong, religion, but, the, anti, religion, this, sentiment, is, an, important, backdrop, for, the, battles, of, the, faerie, queene, spenser, was, called, the, poet, s, poet, by, charles, lamb, and, was, admired, by, john, milton, william, blake, william, wordsworth, john, keats, lord, byron, alfred, tennyson, and, others, among, his, contemporaries, walter, raleigh, wrote, a, commendatory, poem, to, the, faerie, queene, in, 1590, in, which, he, claims, to, admire, and, value, spenser, s, work, more, so, than, any, other, in, the, english, language, john, milton, in, his, areopagitica, mentions, our, sage, and, serious, poet, spenser, whom, i, dare, be, known, to, think, a, better, teacher, than, scotus, or, aquinas, in, the, 18th, century, alexander, pope, compared, spenser, to, a, mistress, whose, faults, we, see, but, love, her, with, them, all, in, his, work, a, view, of, the, present, state, of, irelande, 1596, spenser, discussed, future, plans, to, establish, control, over, ireland, the, most, recent, irish, uprising, led, by, hugh, o, neill, having, demonstrated, the, futility, of, previous, efforts, the, work, is, partly, a, defence, of, lord, arthur, grey, de, wilton, who, was, appointed, lord, deputy, of, ireland, in, 1580, and, who, greatly, influenced, spenser, s, thinking, on, ireland, the, goal, of, the, piece, was, to, show, that, ireland, was, in, great, need, of, reform, spenser, believed, that, ireland, is, a, diseased, portion, of, the, state, it, must, first, be, cured, and, reformed, before, it, could, be, in, a, position, to, appreciate, the, good, sound, laws, and, blessings, of, the, nation, in, a, view, of, the, present, state, of, ireland, spenser, categorises, the, evils, of, the, irish, people, into, three, prominent, categories, laws, customs, and, religion, according, to, spenser, these, three, elements, worked, together, in, creating, the, supposedly, disruptive, and, degraded, people, who, inhabited, the, country, one, example, given, in, the, work, is, the, irish, law, system, termed, brehon, law, which, at, the, time, trumped, the, established, law, as, dictated, by, the, crown, the, brehon, system, had, its, own, court, and, methods, of, punishing, infractions, committed, spenser, viewed, this, system, as, a, backward, custom, which, contributed, to, the, degradation, of, the, irish, people, a, particular, legal, punishment, viewed, with, distaste, by, spenser, was, the, brehon, method, of, dealing, with, murder, which, was, to, impose, an, raic, fine, on, the, murderer, s, family, from, spenser, s, viewpoint, the, appropriate, punishment, for, murder, was, capital, punishment, spenser, also, warned, of, the, dangers, that, allowing, the, education, of, children, in, the, irish, language, would, bring, soe, that, the, speach, being, irish, the, hart, must, needes, be, irishe, for, out, of, the, aboundance, of, the, hart, the, tonge, speaketh, he, pressed, for, a, scorched, earth, policy, in, ireland, noting, its, effectiveness, in, the, second,
