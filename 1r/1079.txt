mongols, could, proceed, no, further, some, modern, historians, speculate, that, batu, intended, primarily, to, assure, his, flanks, were, safe, for, the, future, from, possible, interference, from, the, europeans, and, partially, as, a, precursor, to, further, conquest, most, believe, he, intended, the, conquest, of, all, europe, as, soon, as, his, flanks, were, safe, and, his, forces, ready,
