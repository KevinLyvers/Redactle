croce, hermes, pan, hannah, hyam, and, john, mueller, all, consider, rogers, to, have, been, astaire, s, finest, dance, partner, principally, because, of, her, ability, to, combine, dancing, skills, natural, beauty, and, exceptional, abilities, as, a, dramatic, actress, and, comedian, thus, truly, complementing, astaire, a, peerless, dancer, the, resulting, song, and, dance, partnership, enjoyed, a, unique, credibility, in, the, eyes, of, audiences, of, the, 33, partnered, dances, rogers, performed, with, astaire, croce, and, mueller, have, highlighted, the, infectious, spontaneity, of, her,

to, her, consummate, professionalism, even, during, periods, of, intense, strain, as, she, tried, to, juggle, her, many, other, contractual, film, commitments, with, the, punishing, rehearsal, schedules, of, astaire, who, made, at, most, two, films, in, any, one, year, in, 1986, shortly, before, his, death, astaire, remarked, all, the, girls, i, ever, danced, with, thought, they, couldn, t, do, it, but, of, course, they, could, so, they, always, cried, all, except, ginger, no, no, ginger, never, cried, john, mueller, summed, up, rogers, s, abilities, as, rogers, was, outstanding, among, astaire, s, partners, not, because, she, was, superior, to, others, as, a, dancer, but, because, as, a, skilled, intuitive, actress, she, was, cagey, enough, to, realize, that, acting, did, not, stop, when, dancing, began, the, reason, so, many, women, have, fantasized, about, dancing, with, fred, astaire, is, that, ginger, rogers, conveyed, the, impression, that, dancing, with, him, is, the, most,

facing, bankruptcy, the, studio, paired, fred, and, ginger, for, another, movie, titled, carefree, but, it, lost, money, next, came, the, story, of, vernon, and, irene, castle, based, on, a, true, story, but, the, serious, plot, and, tragic, ending, resulted, in, the, worst, box, office, receipts, of, any, of, their, films, this, was, driven, not, by, diminished, popularity, but, by, the, hard, 1930s, economic, reality, the, production, costs, of, musicals, always, significantly, more, costly, than, regular, features, continued, to, increase, at, a, much, faster, rate, than, admissions,
