fu, mausoleum, chinese, pinyin, f, l, ng, is, located, east, of, shenyang, among, the, most, lasting, contributions, nurhaci, left, his, descendants, was, the, establishment, of, the, eight, banners, which, would, eventually, form, the, backbone, of, the, military, that, dominated, the, qing, empire, the, status, of, banners, did, not, change, much, over, the, course, of, nurhaci, s, lifetime, nor, in, subsequent, reigns, remaining, mostly, under, the, control, of, the, royal, family, the, two, elite, yellow, banners, were, consistently, under, nurhaci, s, control, the, two, blue, banners, were, controlled, by, nurhaci, s, brother, urhaci, until, he, died, at, which, point, the, blue, banners, were, given, to, urhaci, s, two, sons, chiurhala, and, amin, nurhaci, s, eldest, son, cuyen, controlled, the, white, banner, for, most, of, his, father, s, reign, until, he, rebelled, then, the, bordered, white, banner, was, given, to, nurhaci, s, grandson, and, the, plain, white, was, given, to, his, eighth, son, and, heir, hong, taiji, however, by, the, end, of, nurhaci, s, reign, hong, taiji, controlled, both, white, banners, finally, the, red, banner, was, run, by, nurhaci, s, second, son, dai, an, later, in, nurhaci, s, reign, the, bordered, red, banner, was, handed, down, to, his, son, dai, an, and, his, son, would, continue, holding, the, two, red, banners, well, into, the, end, of, hong, taiji, s, reign, the, details, of, hong, taiji, s, succession, as, the, khan, of, the, later, jin, dynasty, are, unclear, when, he, died, in, late, 1626, nurhaci, did, not, designate, an,

him, three, sons, ajige, dorgon, and, dodo, to, commit, suicide, to, accompany, him, in, death, this, gesture, has, made, some, historians, suspect, that, nurhaci, had, in, fact, named, the, fifteen, year, old, dorgon, as, a, successor, with, dai, an, as, regent, by, forcing, dorgon, s, mother, to, kill, herself, the, princes, removed, a, strong, base, of, support, for, dorgon, the, reason, such, intrigue, was, necessary, is, that, nurhaci, had, left, the, two, elite, yellow, banners, to, dorgon, and, dodo, who, were, the, sons, of, lady, abahai, hong, taiji, exchanged, control, of, his, two, white, banners, for, that, of, the, two, yellow, banners, shifting, their, influence, and, power, from, his, young, brothers, onto, himself, according, to, hong, taiji, s, later, recollections, amin, and, the, other, beile, were, willing, to, accept, hong, taiji, as, khan, but, amin, then, would, have, wanted, to, leave, with, his, bordered, blue, banner, threatening, to, dissolve, nurhaci, s, unification, of, the, jurchens, eventually, the, older, dai, an, worked, out, a, compromise, that, allowed, hong, taiji, as, the, khan, but, almost, equal, to, the, other, three, senior, beiles, hong, taiji, would, eventually, find, ways, to, become, the, undisputed, leader, the, change, of, the, name, from, jurchen, to, manchu, by, hong, taiji, was, made, to, hide, the, fact, that, the, ancestors,
