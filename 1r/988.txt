standard, curriculum, of, orthodox, jurisprudence, according, to, the, hanbali, school, of, islamic, law, which, was, the, school, most, prevalent, in, his, area, of, birth, he, promoted, strict, adherence, to, traditional, islamic, law, proclaiming, the, necessity, of, returning, directly, to, the, quran, and, ad, th, literature, rather, than, relying, on, medieval, interpretations, and, insisted, that, every, muslim, male, and, female, personally, read, and, study, the, quran, he, opposed, taqlid, blind, following, and, called, for, the, use, of, ijtihad, independent, legal,

innovation, or, even, idolatry, while, being, known, as, a, hanbali, jurist, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, minimized, reliance, on, medieval, legal, manuals, instead, engaging, in, direct, interpretation, of, religious, scriptures, based, on, the, principles, of, hanbali, jurisprudence, his, call, for, social, reforms, was, based, on, the, key, doctrine, of, tawhid, oneness, of, god, and, was, greatly, inspired, by, the, treatises, of, classical, scholars, ibn, taymiyya, d, 728, a, h, 1328, c, e, and, ibn, qayyim, d, 751, a, h, 1350, c, e, despite, being, opposed, or, rejected, by, some, of, his,

uyayna, a, village, in, the, najd, region, of, central, arabia, before, the, emergence, of, the, movement, there, was, a, very, limited, history, of, islamic, education, in, the, area, for, this, reason, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, had, modest, access, to, islamic, education, during, his, youth, despite, this, the, area, had, nevertheless, produced, several, notable, jurists, of, the, hanbali, school, of, orthodox, sunni, jurisprudence, which, was, the, school, of, law, most, prominently, practiced, in, the, area, in, fact, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, own, family, had, produced, several, doctors, of, the, school, with, his, father, abd, al, wahh, b, having, been, the, hanbali, jurisconsult, of, the, najd, and, his, grandfather, sulaym, n, having, been, a, judge, of, hanbali, law, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, early, education, was, taught, by, his, father, and, consisted, of, learning, the, quran, by, heart, and, studying, a, rudimentary, level, of, hanbali, jurisprudence, and, islamic, theology, as, outlined, in, the, works, of, ibn, qudamah, d, 1223, one, of, the, most, influential, medieval, representatives, of, the, hanbali, school, whose, works, were, regarded, as, having, great, authority, in, the, najd, the, affirmation, of, islamic, sainthood, and, the, ability, of, saints, to, perform, miracles, karamat, by, the, grace, of, god, had, become, a, major, aspect, of, sunni, muslim, belief, throughout, the, islamic, world, being, agreed, upon, by, majority, of, the, classical, islamic, scholars, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, had, encountered, various, excessive, beliefs, and, practices, associated, with, saint, veneration, and, saint, cults, which, were, prevalent, in, his, area, during, that, era, various, supernatural, rituals, and, beliefs, associated, with, magic, superstitions, occultism, numerology, etc, had, become, predominant, across, numerous, towns, and, villages, of, arabian, peninsula, he, probably, chose, to, leave, najd, and, look, elsewhere, for, studies, to, see, if, such, beliefs, and, rituals, were, as, popular, in, the, neighboring, places, of, the, muslim, world, or, the, possibility, that, his, home, town, offered, inadequate, educational, resources, even, today, the, reasoning, for, why, he, left, najd, is, unclear, after, leaving, uyayna, around, the, age, of, twenty, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, performed, the, greater, pilgrimage, in, mecca, where, the, scholars, appear, to, have, held, opinions, and, espoused, teachings, that, were, unpalatable, to, him, after, this, he, went, to, medina, the, stay, at, which, seems, to, have, been, decisive, in, shaping, the, later, direction, of, his, thought, in, medina, he, met, a, hanbali, theologian, from, najd, named, abd, all, h, ibn, ibr, h, m, al, najd, who, had, been, a, supporter, of, the, works, of, ibn, taymiyyah, d, 1328, who, holds, an, exceptionally, high, position, in, islamic, history, many, sunni, muslim, scholars, who, adhere, to, a, scripture, focused, orthodox, methodology, praise, ibn, taymiyyah, to, be, a, mujadid, of, the, authentic, sunnah, taking, pride, in, the, proliferation, of, his, strict, adherence, to, the, qur, an, sunnah, and, way, of, the, companions, of, muhammad, though, his, teachings, had, been, considered, heterodox, and, misguided, by, some, sunni, muslim, scholars, who, ascribed, to, the, sufis, of, their, time, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, teacher, abdallah, ibn, ibrahim, ibn, sayf, introduced, the, relatively, young, man, to, mohammad, hayya, al, sindhi, in, medina, who, belonged, to, the, naqshbandi, order, tariqa, of, sufism, and, recommended, him, as, a, student, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, and, al, sindhi, became, very, close, and, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, stayed, with, him, for, some, time, muhammad, hayya, taught, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, to, reject, popular, religious, practices, associated, with, walis, and, their, tombs, he, also, encouraged, him, to, reject, rigid, imitation, taqlid, of, medieval, legal, commentaries, and, develop, individual, research, of, scriptures, ijtihad, influenced, by, al, sindi, s, teachings, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, became, critical, of, the, established, madh, hab, system, prompting, him, to, disregard, the, instruments, of, usul, al, fiqh, in, his, intellectual, approach, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, rarely, made, use, of, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, and, various, legal, opinions, in, his, writings, by, and, large, forming, views, based, on, his, direct, understanding, of, scriptures, apart, from, his, emphasis, on, hadith, studies, aversion, for, the, madhhab, system, and, disregard, for, technical, juristic, discussions, involving, legal, principles, ibn, abd, al, wahh, b, s, views, on, ziy, rah, visitations, to, the, shrines, of, awliyaa, were, also, shaped, by, al, sindhi, sindi, encouraged, his, student, to, reject, folk, practices, associated, with, graves, and, saints, various, themes, in, al, sindi, s, writings, such, as, his, opposition, to, erecting, tombs, and, drawing, human, images, would, be, revived, later, by, the, wahhabi, movement, sindi, instilled, in, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, the, belief, that, practices, like, beseeching, the, dead, saints, constituted, apostasy, and, resembled, the, customs, of, the, people, of, jahiliyya, pre, islamic, era, in, a, significant, encounter, between, a, young, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, and, al, sindhi, reported, by, the, najdi, historian, uthman, ibn, bishr, d, 1288, a, h, 1871, 2, c, e, one, day, shaykh, mu, ammad, stood, by, the, chamber, of, the, prophet, where, people, were, calling, and, seeking, help, by, the, prophet, s, chamber, blessings, and, peace, be, upon, him, he, then, saw, mu, ammad, ay, t, and, came, to, him, the, shaykh, asked, what, do, you, say, about, them, he, said, verily, that, in, which, they, are, engaged, shall, be, destroyed, and, their, acts, are, invalid, following, his, early, education, in, medina, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, traveled, outside, of, the, arabian, peninsula, venturing, first, to, basra, which, was, still, an, active, center, of, islamic, culture, during, his, stay, in, basra, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, studied, hadith, and, fiqh, under, the, islamic, scholar, muhammad, al, majmu, i, in, basra, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, came, into, contact, with, shi, is, and, would, write, a, treatise, repudiating, the, theological, doctrines, of, rafidah, an, extreme, sect, of, shiism, he, also, became, influenced, by, the, writings, of, hanbali, theologian, ibn, rajab, d, 1393, c, e, 795, a, h, such, as, kalimat, al, ikhlas, which, inspired, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, seminal, treatise, kitab, al, tawhid, his, leave, from, basra, marked, the, end, of, his, education, and, by, the, time, of, his, return, to, uyayna, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, had, mastered, various, religious, disciplines, such, as, islamic, fiqh, jurisprudence, theology, hadith, sciences, and, tasawwuf, his, exposure, to, various, practices, centered, around, the, cult, of, saints, and, grave, veneration, would, eventually, propel, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, to, grow, critical, of, sufi, superstitious, accretions, and, practices, rather, than, targeting, sufism, as, a, phenomenon, or, a, group, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, denounced, particular, practices, which, he, considered, sinful, he, fashioned, his, reformist, campaign, in, a, manner, that, appealed, to, the, socio, cultural, dynamics, of, 18th, century, arabia, many, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, scholarly, treatises, pamphlets, and, speeches, appropriated, idioms, of, local, arab, dialects, monologues, of, vernacular, poetry, and, catchphrases, of, folk, culture, into, his, religious, discourse, as, a, gifted, communicator, with, a, talent, for, breaking, down, his, ideas, into, shorter, units, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, entitled, his, treatises, with, terms, such, as, qaw, id, principles, mas, il, matters, kalim, t, phrases, or, u, l, foundations, simplifying, his, texts, point, by, point, for, mass, reading, calling, upon, the, people, to, follow, his, call, for, religious, revival, tajdid, based, on, following, the, founding, texts, and, the, authoritative, practices, of, the, first, generations, of, muslims, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, declared, i, do, not, god, be, blessed, conform, to, any, particular, sufi, order, or, faqih, nor, follow, the, course, of, any, speculative, theologian, mutakalim, or, any, other, imam, for, that, matter, not, even, such, dignitaries, as, ibn, al, qayyim, al, dhahabi, or, ibn, kathir, i, summon, you, only, to, god, and, only, him, as, well, as, observe, the, path, laid, by, his, prophet, god, s, messenger, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, call, gradually, began, to, attract, followers, including, the, ruler, of, uyayna, uthman, ibn, mu, ammar, upon, returning, to, huraymila, where, his, father, had, settled, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, wrote, his, first, work, on, the, unity, of, god, with, ibn, mu, ammar, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, agreed, to, support, ibn, mu, ammar, s, political, ambitions, to, expand, his, rule, over, najd, and, possibly, beyond, in, exchange, for, the, ruler, s, support, for, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, religious, teachings, during, the, early, years, of, preaching, he, criticised, various, folk, practices, and, superstitions, peacefully, through, sermons, starting, from, 1742, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, would, shift, towards, an, activist, stance, and, began, to, implement, his, reformist, ideas, first, he, persuaded, ibn, mu, ammar, to, help, him, level, the, tomb, of, zayd, ibn, al, khattab, a, companion, of, muhammad, whose, shrine, was, revered, by, locals, secondly, he, ordered, the, cutting, down, of, trees, considered, sacred, by, locals, cutting, down, the, most, glorified, of, all, of, the, trees, himself, third, he, organized, the, stoning, of, a, woman, who, confessed, to, having, committed, adultery, these, actions, gained, the, attention, of, sulaiman, ibn, muhammad, ibn, ghurayr, of, the, tribe, of, bani, khalid, the, chief, of, al, hasa, and, qatif, who, held, substantial, influence, in, najd, ibn, ghurayr, threatened, ibn, mu, ammar, by, denying, him, the, ability, to, collect, a, land, tax, for, some, properties, that, ibn, mu, ammar, owned, in, al, hasa, if, he, did, not, kill, or, drive, away, from, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, consequently, ibn, mu, ammar, forced, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, to, leave, the, early, wahhabis, had, been, protected, by, ibn, mu, ammar, in, uyayna, despite, being, persecuted, in, other, settlements, as, soon, as, ibn, mu, ammar, disowned, them, wahhabis, were, subject, to, excommunication, takfir, exposing, themselves, to, loss, of, lives, and, property, this, experience, of, suffering, reminded, them, of, the, mihna, against, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, and, his, followers, and, shaped, the, collective, wahhabi, memory, as, late, as, 1749, the, sharif, of, mecca, imprisoned, those, wahhabis, who, went, to, mecca, to, perform, the, hajj, annual, pilgrimage, upon, his, expulsion, from, uyayna, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, was, invited, to, settle, in, neighboring, diriyah, by, its, ruler, muhammad, ibn, saud, al, muqrin, after, some, time, in, diriyah, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, concluded, his, second, and, more, successful, agreement, with, a, ruler, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, and, muhammad, bin, saud, agreed, that, together, they, would, bring, the, arabs, of, the, peninsula, back, to, the, true, principles, of, islam, as, they, saw, it, according, to, the, anonymous, author, of, lam, al, shihab, brilliance, of, the, meteor, when, they, first, met, ibn, saud, declared, this, oasis, is, yours, do, not, fear, your, enemies, by, the, name, of, god, if, all, nejd, was, summoned, to, throw, you, out, we, will, never, agree, to, expel, you, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, replied, you, are, the, settlement, s, chief, and, wise, man, i, want, you, to, grant, me, an, oath, that, you, will, perform, jihad, against, the, unbelievers, in, return, you, will, be, imam, leader, of, the, muslim, community, and, i, will, be, leader, in, religious, matters, the, agreement, was, confirmed, with, a, mutual, oath, of, loyalty, bay, ah, in, 1744, once, al, sa, ud, made, dir, iyya, a, safe, haven, wahhabis, from, other, towns, took, refuge, these, included, dissenters, from, ibn, mu, ammar, clan, who, had, sworn, allegiance, to, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, the, nucleus, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, supporters, all, across, najd, retreated, to, dir, iyyah, and, formed, the, vanguard, of, the, insurgency, launched, by, al, saud, against, other, towns, from, a, person, who, started, his, career, as, a, lone, activist, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, would, become, the, spiritual, guide, of, the, nascent, emirate, of, muhammad, ibn, saud, al, muqrin, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, would, be, responsible, for, religious, matters, and, ibn, saud, in, charge, of, political, and, military, issues, this, agreement, became, a, mutual, support, pact, and, power, sharing, arrangement, between, the, aal, saud, family, and, the, aal, ash, sheikh, and, followers, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, which, had, remained, in, place, for, nearly, 300, years, providing, the, ideological, impetus, to, saudi, expansion, reviving, the, teachings, of, ibn, taymiyya, the, muwa, id, n, unitarian, movement, emphasized, strict, adherence, to, qur, an, and, sunnah, while, simultaneously, championing, the, conception, of, an, islamic, state, based, on, the, model, of, early, muslim, community, in, medina, meanwhile, it, s, muslim, and, western, opponents, derogatorily, labelled, the, movement, as, the, wahh, biyyah, anglicised, as, wahhabism, the, 1744, pact, between, muhammad, ibn, saud, and, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, marked, the, rise, of, the, first, saudi, state, the, emirate, of, diriyah, which, was, established, in, 1727, by, offering, the, al, saud, a, clearly, defined, religious, mission, the, alliance, provided, the, ideological, impetus, to, saudi, expansion, deducing, from, his, bitter, experiences, in, uyaynah, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, had, understood, the, necessity, of, political, backing, from, a, strong, islamic, political, entity, to, transform, the, local, socio, religious, status, quo, and, also, safeguard, wahhabism, s, territorial, base, from, external, pressure, after, consolidating, his, position, in, diriyah, he, wrote, to, the, rulers, and, clerics, of, other, towns, appealing, them, to, embrace, his, doctrines, while, some, heeded, his, calls, others, rejected, it, accusing, him, of, ignorance, or, sorcery, realising, the, significance, of, efficient, religious, preaching, da, wa, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, called, upon, his, students, to, master, the, path, of, reasoning, and, proselytising, over, warfare, to, convince, other, muslims, of, their, reformist, endeavour, between, 1744, and, 1746, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, preaching, continued, in, the, same, non, violent, manner, as, before, and, spread, widely, across, the, people, of, najd, rulers, of, various, towns, across, najd, pledged, their, allegiance, to, ibn, su, d, this, situation, changed, drastically, around, 1158, 1746, when, the, powerful, anti, wahhabi, chieftain, of, riyadh, dahh, m, ibn, daww, s, fl, 1187, 1773, attacked, the, town, of, manfuha, which, had, pledged, allegiance, to, diriyah, this, would, spark, a, nearly, 30, year, long, between, diriyah, and, riyadh, which, lasted, until, 1187, 1773, barring, some, interruptions, first, conquering, najd, muhammad, ibn, saud, s, forces, expanded, the, wahhabi, influence, to, most, of, the, present, day, territory, of, saudi, arabia, eradicating, various, popular, practices, they, viewed, as, akin, to, polytheism, and, propagating, the, doctrines, of, abd, al, wahhab, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahh, b, maintained, that, the, military, campaigns, of, the, emirate, of, dir, iyya, were, strictly, defensive, and, rebuked, his, opponents, as, being, the, first, to, initiate, takfir, excommunication, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, had, defined, jihad, as, an, activity, that, must, have, a, valid, religious, justification, and, which, can, only, be, declared, by, an, imam, whose, purpose, must, be, strictly, defensive, in, nature, justifying, the, wahhabi, military, campaigns, as, defensive, operations, against, their, enemies, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, asserts, as, for, warfare, until, today, we, did, not, fight, anyone, except, in, defense, of, our, lives, and, honor, they, came, to, us, in, our, area, and, did, not, spare, any, effort, in, fighting, us, we, only, initiated, fighting, against, some, of, them, in, retaliation, for, their, continued, aggression, 42, 40, they, are, the, ones, who, started, declaring, us, to, be, unbelievers, and, fighting, us, in, 1753, 4, the, wahhabis, were, confronted, by, an, alarming, number, of, towns, renouncing, allegiance, and, aligning, with, their, opponents, most, prominent, amongst, these, was, the, town, of, huraymila, which, had, pledged, allegiance, to, dir, iyah, in, 1747, however, by, 1752, a, group, of, rebels, encouraged, by, ibn, abd, al, wahh, b, s, brother, sulaym, n, had, initiated, a, coup, in, huraymila, and, installed, a, new, ruler, that, threatened, to, topple, the, wahh, b, order, a, fierce, war, between, diriyah, and, huraymila, began, in, a, magnitude, that, was, unprecedented, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, held, a, convocation, of, wahhabis, from, all, the, settlements, across, najd, reviewing, the, recent, desertions, and, defeats, he, encouraged, them, to, hold, fast, to, their, faith, and, recommit, to, the, struggle, the, ensuing, battles, and, the, re, capture, of, huraymila, in, 1168, 1755, constituted, a, significant, development, in, wahhabi, expansionist, stage, abd, al, azeez, the, son, of, muhammad, ibn, saud, had, emerged, as, the, principal, leader, of, the, wahhabi, military, operations, alongside, a, force, of, 800, men, accompanied, by, an, additional, 200, under, the, command, of, the, deposed, ruler, of, huraymila, abd, al, azeez, was, able, to, subdue, the, rebels, more, significantly, the, rationale, behind, the, campaign, was, based, on, ibn, abd, al, wahh, b, s, newly, written, epistle, muf, d, al, mustaf, d, which, marked, a, shift, from, the, earlier, posture, of, defensive, jihad, to, justify, a, more, aggressive, one, in, the, treatise, compiled, to, justify, jihad, pursued, by, dir, iyyah, and, its, allies, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, excommunicated, the, inhabitants, of, huraymila, and, declared, it, as, a, duty, of, wahhabi, soldiers, to, fight, them, as, apostates, he, also, quoted, several, qur, anic, verses, indicative, of, offensive, forms, of, jih, d, the, last, point, of, serious, threat, to, the, saudi, state, was, in, 1764, 1765, during, this, period, the, ism, l, sh, a, of, najr, n, alongside, their, allied, tribe, of, ujman, combined, forces, to, inflict, a, major, defeat, on, the, saudis, at, the, battle, of, hair, in, october, 1764, killing, around, 500, men, the, anti, wahhabi, forces, allied, with, the, invaders, and, participated, in, the, combined, siege, of, dir, iyya, however, the, defenders, were, able, to, hold, onto, their, town, due, to, the, unexpected, departure, of, the, najranis, after, a, truce, concluded, with, the, saudis, a, decade, later, in, 1773, 4, abd, al, azeez, had, conquered, riyadh, and, secured, the, entirety, of, al, ri, after, its, chieftain, dahham, ibn, dawwas, fled, by, 1776, 7, sulayman, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, had, surrendered, the, capture, of, riyadh, marked, the, point, at, which, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, delegated, all, affairs, of, governing, to, abd, al, azeez, withdrew, from, public, life, and, devoted, himself, to, teaching, preaching, and, worshipping, meanwhile, abd, al, azeez, would, proceed, with, his, military, campaigns, conquering, towns, like, sudayr, 1196, 1781, al, kharj, 1199, 1784, etc, opposition, in, towns, to, the, north, like, al, qa, m, was, stamped, out, by, 1196, 1781, and, the, rebels, in, unayza, were, subdued, by, 1202, 1787, further, north, the, town, of, il, was, captured, in, 1201, 1786, and, by, the, 1780s, wahh, b, s, were, able, to, establish, their, jurisdiction, over, most, of, najd, after, his, departure, from, public, affairs, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, would, remain, a, consultant, to, abd, al, azeez, who, followed, his, recommendations, however, he, withdrew, from, any, active, military, and, political, activities, of, the, emirate, of, diriyah, and, devoted, himself, to, educational, endeavours, preaching, and, worship, his, last, major, activity, in, state, affairs, was, in, 1202, 1787, when, he, called, on, the,

authority, to, legitimize, the, royal, family, s, rule, political, militant, islam, portal, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, sought, to, revive, and, purify, islam, from, what, he, perceived, as, non, islamic, popular, religious, beliefs, and, practices, by, returning, to, what, he, believed, were, the, fundamental, principles, of, the, islamic, religion, his, works, were, generally, short, full, of, quotations, from, the, qur, an, and, hadith, such, as, his, main, and, foremost, theological, treatise, kit, b, at, taw, d, arabic, the, book, of, oneness, he, taught, that, the, primary, doctrine, of, islam, was, the, uniqueness, and, oneness, of, god, tawhid, and, denounced, those, religious, beliefs, and, practices, widespread, amongst, the, people, of, najd, following, ibn, taymiyya, s, teachings, on, tawhid, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, believed, that, much, of, najd, had, descended, into, superstitious, folk, religion, akin, to, the, period, of, jahiliyya, pre, islamic, era, and, denounced, much, of, their, beliefs, as, polytheism, shirk, he, associated, such, practices, with, the, culture, of, taqlid, imitation, to, established, customs, adored, by, pagan, cults, of, jahiliyya, era, based, on, the, doctrine, of, tawhid, espoused, in, kitab, al, tawhid, the, followers, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, referred, themselves, by, the, designation, al, muwahhidun, unitarians, the, core, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, teaching, is, found, in, kit, b, at, taw, d, a, theological, treatise, which, draws, from, material, in, the, qur, an, and, the, recorded, doings, and, sayings, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, in, the, hadith, literature, it, preaches, that, worship, in, islam, includes, conventional, acts, of, worship, such, as, the, five, daily, prayers, salat, fasting, sawm, supplication, dua, seeking, protection, or, refuge, istia, dha, seeking, help, ist, ana, and, istigatha, of, allah, according, to, david, commins, various, muslims, throughout, history, had, held, the, view, that, declaring, the, testimony, of, faith, is, sufficient, in, becoming, a, muslim, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, did, not, agree, with, this, he, asserted, that, an, individual, who, believed, in, the, existence, of, intercessors, or, intermediaries, alongside, god, was, guilty, of, shirk, polytheism, or, idolatry, this, was, the, major, difference, between, him, and, his, opponents, and, led, him, to, label, his, adversaries, who, engaged, in, folk, rituals, associated, with, such, beliefs, to, be, apostates, a, practice, known, in, islamic, jurisprudence, as, takfir, and, idolaters, mushrikin, another, major, doctrine, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, was, the, concept, known, as, al, udhr, bil, jahl, excuse, of, ignorance, wherein, any, ignorant, person, unaware, of, core, islamic, teachings, is, excused, by, default, until, clarification, as, per, this, doctrine, those, who, fell, into, beliefs, of, shirk, polytheism, or, kufr, disbelief, cannot, be, excommunicated, until, they, have, direct, access, to, scriptural, evidences, and, get, the, opportunity, to, understand, their, mistakes, and, retract, if, not, their, affairs, are, to, be, delegated, only, to, god, hence, he, believed, that, education, and, dialogue, was, the, only, effective, path, for, the, successful, implementation, of, reforms, explaining, this, concept, in, various, pamphlets, addressed, to, the, masses, and, other, scholars, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, declared, what, has, been, mentioned, to, you, about, me, that, i, make, generalised, takf, r, this, is, from, the, slanders, of, the, enemies, we, make, takf, r, of, the, one, who, affirms, the, religion, of, all, h, and, his, messenger, but, then, showed, enmity, towards, it, and, hindered, people, from, it, as, well, as, the, one, who, worshipped, idols, after, he, came, to, know, that, this, is, the, religion, of, the, polytheists, and, beautified, it, for, the, people, every, scholar, on, the, face, of, the, earth, makes, takf, r, of, them, save, an, obstinate, or, ignorant, but, we, make, takf, r, of, the, one, who, associates, partners, with, all, h, in, his, sole, right, of, worship, il, hiyyah, after, we, have, made, clear, to, him, the, proof, for, the, futility, of, shirk, rejecting, the, allegations, of, his, detractors, who, accused, him, of, ex, communicating, whoever, didn, t, follow, his, doctrines, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, maintained, that, he, only, advocated, orthodox, sunni, doctrines, in, a, letter, addressed, to, the, iraqi, scholar, abdul, rahman, al, suwaidi, who, had, sought, clarification, over, the, rumours, spread, against, his, mission, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, explains, i, am, a, man, of, social, standing, in, my, village, and, the, people, respect, my, word, this, led, some, chieftains, to, reject, my, call, because, i, called, them, to, what, contradicts, the, traditions, they, were, raised, to, uphold, the, chieftains, directed, their, criticism, and, enmity, towards, our, enjoining, tawheed, and, forbidding, shirk, among, the, false, accusations, they, propagated, is, the, claim, that, i, accuse, all, muslims, except, my, followers, of, being, kuffar, unbelievers, this, is, truly, incredible, how, can, any, sane, person, accept, such, accusations, would, a, muslim, say, these, things, i, declare, that, i, renounce, before, allah, these, statements, that, only, a, mad, person, would, utter, in, short, what, i, was, accused, of, calling, to, other, than, enjoining, tawheed, and, forbidding, shirk, is, all, false, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, was, highly, critical, of, the, practice, of, taqlid, blind, following, which, in, his, view, deviated, people, away, from, qur, an, and, sunnah, he, also, advocated, for, ijtihad, of, qualified, scholars, in, accordance, with, the, teachings, of, qur, an, and, hadith, in, his, legal, writings, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, referred, to, a, number, of, sources, qur, an, hadith, opinions, of, companions, salaf, as, well, as, the, treatises, of, the, 4, schools, of, thought, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, argued, that, qur, an, condemned, blind, emulation, of, forefathers, and, nowhere, did, it, stipulate, scholarly, credentials, for, a, person, to, refer, to, it, directly, his, advocacy, of, ijtihad, and, harsh, denunciation, of, taqlid, arose, widespread, condemnation, from, sufi, orthodoxy, in, najd, and, beyond, compelling, him, to, express, many, of, his, legal, verdicts, fatwas, discreetly, using, convincing, juristic, terms, he, differed, from, hanbali, school, in, various, points, of, law, and, in, some, cases, also, departed, from, the, positions, of, the, 4, schools, in, his, treatise, usul, al, sittah, six, foundations, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, vehemently, rebuked, his, detractors, for, raising, the, description, of, mujtahids, to, what, he, viewed, as, humanely, unattainable, levels, he, condemned, the, establishment, clergy, as, a, class, of, oppressors, who, ran, a, tyranny, of, wordly, possessions, by, exploiting, the, masses, to, make, money, out, of, their, religious, activities, the, teachings, of, medinan, hadith, scholar, muhammad, hayat, as, sindi, highly, influenced, the, anti, taqlid, views, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, opposed, partisanship, to, madhabs, legal, schools, and, didn, t, consider, it, obligatory, to, follow, a, particular, madhab, rather, in, his, view, the, obligation, is, to, follow, qur, an, and, the, sunnah, referring, to, the, classical, scholars, ibn, taymiyya, and, ibn, qayyim, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, condemned, the, popular, practice, prevalent, amongst, his, contemporary, scholars, to, blindfollow, latter, day, legal, works, and, urged, muslims, to, take, directly, from, qur, an, and, sunnah, he, viewed, it, as, a, duty, upon, every, muslim, laymen, and, scholar, male, female, to, seek, knowledge, directly, from, the, sources, radically, departing, from, both, ibn, taymiyya, and, ibn, qayyim, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, viewed, the, entirety, of, the, prevalent, mad, hab, system, of, jurisprudence, fiqh, as, a, fundamentally, corrupt, institution, seeking, a, radical, reform, of, scholarly, institutions, and, preached, the, obligation, of, all, muslims, to, directly, refer, to, the, foundational, texts, of, revelation, he, advocated, a, form, of, scholarly, authority, based, upon, the, revival, of, the, practice, of, ittiba, i, e, laymen, following, the, scholars, only, after, seeking, evidences, the, prevalent, legal, system, was, in, his, view, a, factory, for, the, production, of, slavish, emulators, symbolic, of, muslim, decline, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, elucidated, his, concept, on, the, nature, of, prophethood, in, his, book, mukhta, ar, s, rat, al, ras, l, abridgement, of, the, life, of, the, prophet, an, extensive, biographical, work, on, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, mukhta, ar, was, written, with, the, purpose, of, explaining, muhammad, s, role, in, universal, history, by, undermining, certain, prophetologic, conceptions, that, had, come, to, prominence, among, sunn, religious, circles, during, the, twelfth, islamic, century, these, included, negating, those, concepts, and, beliefs, that, bestowed, the, prophet, with, mystical, attributes, that, elevated, muhammad, beyond, the, status, of, ordinary, humans, in, his, introduction, to, mukhtasar, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, asserts, that, every, prophet, came, with, the, mission, of, upholding, tawhid, and, prohibiting, shirk, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, further, tries, to, undermine, the, belief, in, the, pre, existence, of, mu, ammad, as, a, divine, light, preceding, all, other, creation, a, salient, concept, that, served, as, an, aspect, of, prophetic, devotion, during, the, eleventh, islamic, century, additionally, ibn, abd, al, wahh, b, omitted, mentioning, other, episodes, narrated, in, various, sirah, prophetic, biography, works, such, as, trees, and, stones, allegedly, expressing, veneration, for, mu, ammad, purification, of, muhammad, s, heart, by, angels, etc, which, suggested, that, mu, ammad, possessed, characteristics, that, transcend, those, of, ordinary, humans, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, adhered, to, ibn, taymiyya, s, understanding, of, the, concept, of, isma, infallibility, which, insisted, that, i, ma, does, not, prevent, prophets, from, committing, minor, sins, or, speaking, false, things, this, differed, from, the, alternative, understanding, of, sunni, theologians, like, fakhr, al, d, n, al, r, zi, q, iy, etc, who, had, emphasised, the, complete, independence, of, the, prophet, from, any, form, of, error, or, sin, following, ibn, taymiyya, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, affirmed, the, incident, of, qi, at, al, ghar, n, q, the, story, of, cranes, or, satanic, verses, which, demonstrated, that, muhammad, was, afflicted, by, satanic, interference, this, idea, of, ibn, taymiyya, had, been, recently, revived, in, the, circles, of, kurdish, hadith, scholar, ibr, h, m, al, k, r, n, 1025, 1616, 1101, 1686, whose, son, ab, l, hir, al, k, r, n, was, the, teacher, of, mu, ammad, ay, t, al, sindi, the, master, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, using, this, concept, to, explain, tawhid, al, ul, hiyya, oneness, of, worship, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, rejected, the, idea, that, anybody, could, act, as, intercessor, between, god, and, man, by, employing, the, qur, nic, verses, related, to, the, event, he, also, used, these, and, other, similar, incidents, to, undermine, the, belief, regarding, prophets, being, completely, free, from, sin, error, or, satanic, afflictions, furthermore, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, had, given, little, importance, to, prophetic, miracles, in, his, mukhta, ar, although, he, hadn, t, denied, miracles, as, an, expression, of, divine, omnipotence, so, long, as, they, are, attested, by, qur, an, or, authentic, hadith, al, mukhtasar, represented, an, open, protest, against, the, exuberance, of, miracles, that, characterised, later, biographies, of, mu, ammad, in, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, view, miracles, are, of, little, significance, in, the, life, of, mu, ammad, in, comparison, to, that, of, the, previous, prophets, since, central, to, his, prophethood, were, the, institutionalisation, of, jih, d, and, the, udud, punishments, contrary, to, prevalent, religious, beliefs, mu, ammad, was, not, portrayed, as, the, central, purpose, of, creation, in, the, historical, conception, of, mukhta, ar, instead, he, has, a, function, within, creation, and, for, the, created, beings, rather, than, being, viewed, as, an, extraordinary, performer, of, miracles, muhammad, should, instead, be, upheld, as, a, model, of, emulation, by, depriving, the, person, of, mu, ammad, of, all, supernatural, aspects, not, related, to, wahy, revelation, and, divine, intervention, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, also, re, inforced, his, rejection, of, beliefs, and, practices, related, to, cult, of, saints, and, veneration, of, graves, thus, ibn, abd, al, wahh, b, s, conception, of, history, emphasised, the, necessity, to, follow, the, role, model, of, mu, ammad, and, re, establish, the, islamic, order, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, movement, is, known, today, as, wahhabism, arabic, romanized, wahh, biyyah, the, designation, of, his, doctrine, as, wahh, biyyah, actually, derives, from, his, father, s, name, abd, al, wahhab, many, adherents, consider, the, label, wahhabism, as, a, derogatory, term, coined, by, his, opponents, and, prefer, it, to, be, known, as, the, salafi, movement, modern, scholars, of, islamic, studies, point, out, that, salafism, is, a, term, applied, to, several, forms, of, puritanical, islam, in, various, parts, of, the, world, while, wahhabism, refers, to, the, specific, saudi, school, which, is, seen, as, a, more, strict, form, of, salafism, however, modern, scholars, remark, that, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, followers, adopted, the, term, salafi, as, a, self, designation, much, later, his, early, followers, denominated, themselves, as, ahl, al, tawhid, and, al, muwahhidun, unitarians, or, those, who, affirm, defend, the, unity, of, god, and, were, labeled, wahhabis, by, their, opponents, the, salafiyya, movement, was, not, directly, connected, to, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, movement, in, najd, according, to, professor, abdullah, saeed, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, should, rather, be, considered, as, one, of, the, precursors, of, the, modern, salafiyya, movement, since, he, called, for, a, return, to, the, pristine, purity, of, the, early, eras, of, islam, by, adhering, to, the, qur, an, and, the, sunnah, rejection, of, the, blind, following, taqlid, of, earlier, scholars, and, advocating, for, ijtihad, scholars, like, adam, j, silverstein, consider, wahhabi, movement, as, the, most, influential, expression, of, salafism, of, the, islamist, sort, both, for, its, role, in, shaping, some, might, say, creating, modern, islamism, and, for, disseminating, salafi, ideas, widely, across, the, muslim, world, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, approach, to, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, was, based, on, four, major, principles, according, to, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, the, clear, meaning, of, authentic, hadiths, takes, precedence, over, the, opinions, of, any, other, scholar, even, if, it, went, against, the, agreement, of, the, eponyms, of, the, four, madhabs, in, line, with, these, principles, he, encouraged, all, believers, to, engage, directly, with, the, scriptures, while, respecting, ikhtilaf, scholarly, differences, writing, the, companions, of, the, messenger, of, god, may, god, bless, him, and, grant, him, peace, differed, on, various, issues, without, denunciation, so, long, as, the, text, was, not, clear, it, is, upon, the, believer, to, place, his, concern, and, intent, to, know, the, command, of, god, and, his, messenger, in, those, matters, of, disagreement, and, to, act, accordingly, whilst, respecting, the, people, of, knowledge, and, respect, them, even, if, they, erred, but, he, does, not, take, them, as, lords, besides, god, this, is, the, way, of, those, who, are, blessed, as, for, those, who, throw, away, their, speech, and, do, not, respect, then, this, is, the, path, of, those, who, have, incurred, god, s, wrath, throughout, his, epsitles, like, arba, qaw, id, tad, ru, l, a, k, m, alayh, four, rules, on, which, rulings, revolve, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, fiercely, attacked, the, prevalent, hanbali, fiqh, opinions, with, a, broader, view, of, re, orienting, the, fiqh, tradition, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, challenged, the, madhhab, system, by, advocating, for, a, direct, understanding, of, the, scriptures, rather, than, rejecting, madhabs, outright, he, sought, a, reformation, of, the, system, by, condemning, prevalent, trends, within, the, madhabs, he, criticised, the, madhhab, partisans, for, adhering, solely, to, medieval, fiqh, manuals, of, later, scholars, and, ignoring, qur, an, hadith, and, opinions, of, early, imams, he, rebuked, the, contemporary, shafi, i, scholars, for, being, partisans, of, ibn, hajar, al, haytami, d, 1566, and, relying, solely, on, his, 16th, century, manual, tuhfat, al, muhtaj, similarly, he, critiqued, the, malikis, for, being, dependent, on, the, mukhtasar, of, the, egyptian, jurist, khalil, ibn, ishaq, d, 1365, rather, than, acting, upon, authentic, traditions, hadith, in, addition, to, criticising, the, madhab, partisans, he, berated, the, advocates, of, taqlid, for, discouraging, the, practice, of, ijtihad, and, called, on, the, laity, to, follow, scholars, only, after, asking, for, scriptural, evidences, most, noticeably, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, rejected, the, authority, of, al, iqna, and, al, muntaha, two, of, the, most, important, medieval, hanbali, works, for, the, regional, clerics, of, arabia, asserting, the, hanbalis, are, the, least, prone, of, all, people, to, innovation, most, of, the, iqna, and, the, muntah, conflicts, with, the, view, of, ahmad, and, his, explicit, statements, not, to, mention, the, hadith, of, the, messenger, of, god, in, calling, for, a, direct, return, to, the, scriptures, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, was, not, a, literalist, and, often, strongly, objected, to, literalist, approaches, and, ritualism, of, religion, that, came, with, it, he, believed, that, pure, intentions, niyyah, constituted, the, essence, of, all, virtous, actions, and, upheld, its, superiority, over, dull, ritualism, as, a, deferential, and, accomplished, jurist, with, the, experience, of, religious, training, under, numerous, masters, in, his, travels, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, opposed, the, rigid, hardline, views, of, the, tradition, bound, ulema, who, had, excommunicated, sinful, unrepenting, muslims, thereby, making, their, blood, forfeit, based, on, their, reading, of, the, reports, of, muhammad, and, companions, on, the, other, hand, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, contextualised, those, reports, arguing, that, they, must, be, understood, in, recognition, of, historical, circumstances, according, to, his, view, sincerity, and, purity, of, intent, ikhlas, could, expiate, the, evil, of, sins, committed, in, mistakes, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, legal, approach, began, with, hadith, authentication, followed, by, contextualised, intrapolation, in, consideration, of, hanbali, legal, principles, such, as, maslaha, public, welfate, other, legal, criteria, involved, upholding, the, spirit, of, the, law, maqasid, al, sharia, and, intent, behind, pronouncing, legal, verdicts, which, addressed, various, themes, such, as, societal, justice, and, safeguarding, women, he, also, believed, in, a, holistic, legal, understanding, of, qur, anic, verses, and, hadith, distinguishing, between, general, rules, applicable, for, all, muslims, and, rulings, unique, to, various, life, time, situations, as, a, young, scholar, in, medina, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, was, profoundly, influenced, by, the, revivalist, doctrines, taught, by, his, teachers, muhammad, hayyat, ibn, ibrahim, al, sindhi, and, abdullah, ibn, ibrahim, ibn, sayf, much, of, the, wahhabi, teachings, such, as, opposition, to, saint, cults, radical, denunciation, of, blind, following, medieval, commentaries, adherence, to, scriptures, and, other, revivalist, thoughts, came,

a, break, from, the, four, sunni, schools, which, allowed, the, wali, ward, guardian, to, compel, minor, daughters, into, marriage, without, consent, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, also, stipulated, the, permission, of, the, guardian, as, a, condition, in, marriage, in, line, with, traditional, hanbali, shafi, i, and, maliki, schools, nevertheless, as, a, practical, jurist, ibn, abd, al, wahhab,

justification, and, which, can, only, be, declared, by, an, imam, whose, purpose, must, be, strictly, defensive, in, nature, he, viewed, the, military, campaigns, of, the, emirate, of, dir, iyya, as, strictly, defensive, operations, against, aggressive, opponents, who, initiated, takfir, against, his, followers, justifying, the, wahhabi, military, campaigns, as, primarily, defensive, operations, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, asserts, as, for, warfare, until, today, we, did, not, fight, anyone, except, in, defense, of, our, lives, and, honor, they, came, to, us, in, our, area, and, did, not, spare, any, effort, in, fighting, us, we, only, initiated, fighting, against, some, of, them, in, retaliation, for, their, continued, aggression, 42, 40, they, are, the, ones, who, started, declaring, us, to, be, unbelievers, and, fighting, us, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, strongly, condemned, the, veneration, of, muslim, saints, which, he, described, as, worship, or, associating, divinity, to, beings, other, than, god, labeling, it, as, shirk, despite, his, great, aversion, to, venerating, the, saints, after, their, earthly, passing, and, seeking, their, intercession, it, should, nevertheless, be, noted, that, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, did, not, deny, the, existence, of, saints, as, such, on, the, contrary, he, acknowledged, that, the, miracles, of, saints, kar, m, t, al, awliy, are, not, to, be, denied, and, their, right, guidance, by, god, is, acknowledged, when, they, acted, properly, during, their, life, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, opposing, the, practice, of, the, pilgrimage, of,

in, his, main, theological, treatise, kit, b, at, taw, d, describing, the, followers, of, both, christian, and, jewish, faiths, as, sorcerers, who, believe, in, devil, worship, and, by, citing, a, hadith, attributed, to, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, he, stated, that, capital, punishment, for, the, sorcerer, is, that, he, be, struck, with, the, sword, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, asserted, that,

wahhab, concluded, that, the, ways, of, the, people, of, the, book, are, condemned, as, those, of, polytheists, however, western, scholar, natana, j, delong, bas, defended, the, position, of, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, stating, that, despite, his, at, times, vehement, denunciations, of, other, religious, groups, for, their, supposedly, heretical, beliefs, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, never, called, for, their, destruction, or, death, he, assumed, that, these, people, would, be, punished, in, the, afterlife, the, doctrines, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, were, criticized, by, a, number, of, islamic, scholars, during, his, lifetime, accusing, him, of, disregarding, islamic, history, monuments, traditions, and, the, sanctity, of, muslim, life, his, critics, were, mainly, ulama, from, his, homeland, the, najd, region, of, central, arabia, which, was, directly, affected, by, the, growth, of, the, wahhabi, movement, based, in, the, cities, of, basra, mecca, and, medina, some, of, the, early, opponents, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, classified, his, doctrine, as, a, kharijite, sectarian, heresy, on, the, other, hand, ibn, abd, al, wahh, b, and, his, supporters, held, that, they, were, the, victims, of, aggressive, warfare, accusing, their, opponents, of, starting, the, pronouncements, of, takfir, excommunication, and, maintained, that, the, military, operations, of, emirate, of, dir, iyya, were, strictly, defensive, the, memory, of, the, unprovoked, military, offensive, launched, by, dahh, m, ibn, daww, s, fl, 1187, 1773, the, powerful, chieftain, of, riyadh, on, diriyya, in, 1746, was, deeply, engrained, in, the, wahhabi, tradition, early, wahhabi, chronicler, ibn, ghann, m, states, in, his, book, tarikh, an, najd, history, of, najd, that, ibn, abd, al, wahh, b, did, not, order, the, use, of, violence, until, his, enemies, excommunicated, him, and, deemed, his, blood, licit, he, gave, no, order, to, spill, blood, or, to, fight, against, the, majority, of, the, heretics, and, the, misguided, until, they, started, ruling, that, he, and, his, followers, were, to, be, killed, and, excommunicated, by, 1802, the, ottoman, empire, had, officially, begun, to, wage, religious, campaigns, against, the, wahhabis, issuing, tracts, condemning, them, as, kharijites, in, contrast, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, profoundly, despised, the, decorous, arty, tobacco, smoking, music, happy, drum, pounding, egyptian, and, ottoman, nobility, who, traveled, across, arabia, to, pray, at, mecca, each, year, and, intended, to, either, subjugate, them, to, his, doctrine, or, overthrow, them, a, handful, of, arabian, hanbalis, participated, on, the, ottoman, side, of, the, controversy, muhammad, ibn, abdullah, ibn, humayd, s, 19th, century, biographical, dictionary, sheds, light, on, those, hanbali, scholars, however, the, reliability, of, his, biography, itself, is, disputed, for, its, inherent, biases, which, portrays, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, and, his, followers, as, heretics, it, also, misrepresents, many, najdi, hanbali, scholars, as, on, the, side, of, ottoman, hanbalis, ibn, humayd, s, maternal, lineage, al, turki, was, of, some, local, renown, for, its, religious, scholars, including, two, men, who, opposed, the, wahhabi, movement, one, of, them, named, ibn, muhammad, compared, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, with, musaylimah, he, also, accused, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, of, wrongly, declaring, fellow, muslims, to, be, infidels, based, on, a, misguided, reading, of, quranic, passages, and, prophetic, traditions, hadith, and, of, wrongly, declaring, all, scholars, as, infidels, who, did, not, agree, with, his, deviant, innovation, in, contrast, to, this, anti, wahhabi, family, tradition, ibn, humayd, s, early, education, included, extensive, studies, under, two, wahhabi, shaykhs, both, praised, in, his, biographical, dictionary, he, then, travelled, to, damascus, and, mecca, wherein, he, attended, lessons, of, men, known, for, strong, anti, wahhabi, convictions, ibn, humayd, s, compatibility, with, ottoman, religious, outlook, made, him, eligible, for, the, post, of, ottoman, mufti, in, mecca, another, hanbali, scholar, whom, ibn, humayd, portrays, as, a, central, figure, in, rejecting, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, doctrine, was, ibn, fayruz, al, tamimi, al, ahsai, 1729, 30, 1801, 02, ibn, fayruz, publicly, repudiated, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, teachings, when, he, sent, an, envoy, to, him, ibn, fayruz, then, wrote, to, sultan, abdul, hamid, i, and, requested, ottoman, assistance, to, subjugate, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, followers, whom, he, referred, to, as, the, seditious, kharijites, of, najd, the, wahhabis, in, turn, came, to, view, him, as, one, of, their, worst, enemies, and, an, exemplar, of, idolatry, according, to, ibn, humayd, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, father, criticized, his, son, for, his, unwillingness, to, specialize, in, jurisprudence, and, disagreed, with, his, doctrine, and, declared, that, he, would, be, the, cause, of, wickedness, similarly, his, brother, sulayman, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, wrote, one, of, the, first, treatises, refuting, the, wahhabi, doctrine, the, divine, thunderbolts, in, refutation, of, wahhabism, al, aw, iq, al, il, hiyya, f, al, radd, al, al, wahh, biyya, alleging, that, muhammad, was, ill, educated, and, intolerant, and, classing, his, views, as, fringe, and, fanatical, sulayman,

ammad, ibn, abd, al, wahh, b, later, muwahhidun, scholarly, figures, like, abdullah, ibn, abd, al, latif, aal, al, shaykh, d, 1921, c, e, would, respond, to, these, accusations, by, asserting, that, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, refrained, from, making, takfir, shaykh, muhammad, may, god, have, mercy, on, him, never, made, takfeer, of, the, people, in, the, beginning, except, via, establishing, the, proofs, and, the, da, wah, because, at, that, time, there, was, a, dearth, of, knowledge, of, the, message, of, isl, m, and, for, that, reason, he, said, due, to, their, ignorance, and, the, lack, of, anyone, who, makes, them, aware, however, as, for, those, on, whom, the, proofs, are, established, then, there, is, nothing, to, prevent, takfeer, being, made, on, such, people, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, was, known, to, have, had, disagreements, with, both, his, father, and, his, brother, sulayman, sulayman, his, brother, disputed, many, of, his, doctrinal, statements, and, was, one, of, his, staunch, opponents, during, a, certain, time, period, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, father, disagreed, with, his, son, s, metholodolgy, in, implementing, reforms, according, to, historical, records, sulayman, declared, his, repentance, and, started, to, support, his, brother, during, later, life, after, understanding, the, doctrines, and, objectives, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, revivalist, movement, the, 19th, century, anti, wahhabi, critic, and, historian, ahmad, ibn, al, zayni, dahlan, ottoman, empire, s, grand, mufti, of, the, shafi, i, madhab, in, mecca, recorded, the, account, of, the, dispute, between, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, and, his, brother, sulayman, reporting, that, sulayman, once, asked, his, brother, muhammad, how, many, are, the, pillars, of, islam, five, he, answered, sulayman, replied, no, you, have, added, a, sixth, one, he, who, does, not, follow, you, is, not, a, muslim, this, to, you, is, the, sixth, pillar, of, islam, according, to, various, historical, records, sulayman, repented, and, joined, the, religious, mission, of, his, brother, however, there, is, a, disagreement, regarding, his, repentance, while, earlier, najdi, chroniclers, like, ibn, ghannam, reported, he, repented, and, embraced, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, cause, in, diriyah, later, historians, like, ibn, bishr, simply, mentions, his, departure, to, diriyah, with, his, family, and, his, last, years, under, the, protection, of, diriyah, while, being, allowed, by, state, allotted, stipend, a, letter, attributed, to, sulayman, also, mentions, his, public, repentance, the, ottoman, grand, mufti, of, mecca, ahmad, zayni, dahlan, d, 1886, wrote, an, anti, wahhabi, treatise, in, which, he, listed, the, religious, practices, that, the, najdi, hanbalis, considered, idolatrous, visiting, the, tomb, of, muhammad, seeking, the, intercession, of, saints, venerating, muhammad, and, obtaining, the, blessings, of, saints, he, also, accused, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, of, not, adhering, to, the, hanbali, school, and, that, he, was, deficient, in, learning, however, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, had, believed, that, visiting, the, tomb, of, muhammad, was, a, righteous, deed, referring, to, it, as, among, the, best, of, deeds, while, condemning, its, excesses, the, medieval, theologians, ibn, taymiyyah, and, ibn, qayyim, who, inspired, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, had, issued, fatwas, declaring, the, visitations, to, the, tomb, of, muhammad, to, be, haram, forbidden, which, would, lead, to, their, imprisonment, in, response, the, british, indian, ahl, i, hadith, scholar, muhammad, bashir, sahsawani, 1834, 1908, c, e, wrote, the, treatise, sayaanah, al, insaan, an, waswaswah, al, shaikh, dahlaan, in, order, to, refute, dahlan, sahsawani, asserted, that, after, his, correspondence, with, various, scholars, of, the, muwahhidun, movement, and, study, of, their, creedal, works, he, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, allegation, that, they, excommunicated, non, wahhabis, were, false, and, slanderous, the, islamic, scholar, muhammad, rashid, rida, d, 1935, c, e, 1354, a, h, in, his, introduction, to, al, sahsawani, s, refutation, of, dahlan, described, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, as, a, mujaddid, repelling, the, innovations, and, deviations, in, muslim, life, through, his, al, manar, magazine, rashid, rida, greatly, contributed, to, the, spread, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, teachings, in, the, islamic, world, he, was, a, strong, supporter, of, ibn, taymiyyah, and, scholars, of, najd, publishing, works, in, his, magazine, entitled, majmooah, al, rasaail, wa, al, masaail, al, najdiyyah, and, al, wahhaabiyoon, wa, al, hijaaz, rida, notes, that, given, dahlan, s, position, in, mecca, and, availability, there, of, the, works, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, he, must, have, simply, chosen, to, write, otherwise, rida, also, argued, that, dahlan, simply, wrote, what, he, heard, from, people, and, criticised, him, for, not, verifying, reports, and, seeking, out, the, writings, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, he, condemned, dahlan, for, his, ignorance, and, his, sanctioning, of, acts, of, kufr, and, shirk, based, on, his, reinterpretation, of, islamic, texts, rashid, rida, contended, that, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, was, a, victim, of, persecution, by, the, combined, oppression, of, three, forces, i, the, power, of, state, and, its, rulers, ii, power, of, hypocritical, scholars, and, iii, power, of, tyrannical, commoners, fiercely, rebuking, his, opponents, rashid, rida, declared, the, best, weapon, they, brandished, against, him, was, that, he, contradicted, the, majority, of, muslims, who, were, the, majority, of, muslims, muhammad, ibn, abdul, wahhab, contradicted, in, his, da, wah, they, were, bedouins, of, the, desert, worse, than, the, people, of, jahiliyyah, intent, on, looting, and, theft, they, allowed, shedding, the, blood, of, muslims, and, non, muslims, just, to, earn, a, living, they, took, their, tyrants, as, judges, in, every, matter, and, denied, many, aspects, of, islam, on, which, there, is, consensus, matters, in, which, no, muslim, can, claim, ignorance, ali, bey, el, abbassi, a, spanish, explorer, who, was, in, mecca, in, 1803, shortly, after, the, wahhabi, conquest, of, hejaz, presented, a, starkly, different, view, of, the, wahhabis, he, was, surprised, to, find, that, they, were, fairly, moderate, reasonable, and, civilized, he, further, observed, that, rather, than, engaging, in, rampant, violence, and, destruction, the, wahhabis, were, pleasant, and, well, organized, according, to, ali, bey, there, were, major, differences, in, the, political, approach, of, muhammad, ibn, saud, al, muqrin, and, that, of, his, son, abdulaziz, bin, muhammad, al, saud, during, whose, reign, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, was, retired, from, active, public, life, ali, bey, asserts, that, unlike, the, fair, minded, muhammad, ibn, saud, his, son, abd, al, azeez, began, employing, a, convert, or, die, approach, for, the, acquirment, of, wealth, and, stabilising, the, state, ali, bey, writes, in, his, travels, i, discovered, much, reason, and, moderation, among, the, wehhabites, to, whom, i, spoke, and, from, whom, i, obtained, the, greater, part, of, the, information, which, i, have, given, concerning, their, nation, the, reformer, abdoulwehhab, did, not, invest, himself, with, any, honour, or, public, character, he, was, only, the, chief, of, the, sect, and, did, not, require, any, personal, distinction, after, his, death, his, son, who, succeeded, him, preserved, the, same, simplicity, british, diplomat, harford, jones, brydges, who, was, stationed, in, basra, in, 1784, attributed, the, popular, hysteria, about, the, wahhabis, to, a, different, cause, unlike, ottoman, depictions, brydges, believed, that, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, doctrine, was, in, keeping, with, the, teachings, of, quran, was, perfectly, orthodox, consonant, to, the, purest, and, best, interpretations, of, that, volume, and, that, ottomans, feared, its, spread, precisely, on, that, basis, the, egyptian, historian, and, azhari, islamic, scholar, abd, al, rahman, al, jabarti, 1753, 1825, c, e, was, a, great, admirer, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, and, his, movement, he, defended, his, doctrines, in, egypt, and, held, the, movement, in, high, regard, viewing, its, doctrines, as, having, a, great, prospective, to, spearhead, future, islamic, revival, al, jabarti, had, the, chance, to, personally, meet, with, various, wahhabi, scholars, in, egypt, in, 1814, finding, them, to, be, friendly, and, knowledgeable, al, jabarti, stated, that, the, wahhabis, were, modest, men, of, good, morals, well, trained, in, oratory, in, the, principles, of, religion, the, branches, of, fiqh, and, the, disagreements, of, the, schools, of, law, in, all, this, they, were, extraordinary, he, described, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, as, a, man, who, summoned, men, to, qur, an, and, the, prophet, s, sunna,

hand, contemporary, western, historians, and, researchers, have, taken, a, more, nuanced, approach, on, the, history, and, evolution, of, the, wahhabi, movement, pointing, out, the, discrepancy, between, the, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, teachings, some, of, his, later, followers, and, the, actions, of, contemporary, militant, jihadist, groups, various, scholars, assert, that, many, writings, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, were, revised, during, the, 19th, century, by, authorities, of, the, second, saudi, state, transforming, them, away, from, a, poetic, vernacular, style, of, communication, with,

jihadist, movements, are, more, influenced, by, the, ideological, worldview, of, egyptian, islamist, extremism, of, the, 20th, century, rather, than, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, socio, religious, reformism, although, many, salafi, jihadists, maybe, inspired, by, wahhabi, ideals, it, doesn, t, credibly, explain, their, inclinations, towards, lethal, violence, the, development, of, the, hadith, whose, importance, cannot, be, over, emphasized, incorporated, dynamism, into, the, very, heart, of, islam, when, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, criticized, local, customs, in, arabia, on, the, basis, of, their, incongruence, with, the, past, he, was, indeed, trying, to, get, back, to, a, former, golden, age, but, that, is, a, very, modern, thing, to, do, what, the, wahhabis, were, doing, was, to, criticize, current, society, and, seek, to, undermine, the, existing, order, something, that, the, earlier, ibn, taymiyya, fell, foul, of, when, for, having, similar, views, he, was, tortured, and, threatened, with, death, oliver, leaman, professor, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, kentucky, western, scholars, like, michael, ryan, assert, that, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, reformist, teachings, were, a, rationalist, enterprise, that, sought, to, eradicate, superstitions, widespread, in, the, context, of, tribal, rivalry, within, the, arabian, peninsula, moreover, the, regional, background, of, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, s, intellectual, efforts, in, the, chaotic, context, of, the, 18th, century, arabian, peninsula, had, been, distinct, from, the, 21st, century, global, jihad, ideology, of, organisations, like, al, qaeda, or, is, consequently, his, scholarly, heirs, including, the, prestigious, aal, al, shaykhs, constitute, the, primary, ideological, nemesis, of, groups, such, as, al, qaeda, since, the, saudi, population, overwhelmingly, prefers, their, traditional, religious, institutions, and, scholars, to, bin, laden, s, claims, to, revolutionary, jihadi, salafism, al, qaeda, harshly, attacks, these, mainstream, saudi, clerics, with, much, rhetorical, vitriol, various, scholars, have, also, contested, orientalist, portrayals, of, wahhabi, movement, as, ultra, conservative, or, stagnant, noting, its, dynamic, nature, and, capability, of, multiple, interpretations, professor, satoru, nakamura, of, kobe, university, has, criticized, orientalist, scholars, who, depicted, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, as, a, slavish, imitator, of, ibn, taymiyya, without, studying, the, scholar, s, vast, works, and, analysing, historical, nuances, contemporary, academic,
