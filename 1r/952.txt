pope, to, have, been, called, the, great, he, is, perhaps, best, known, for, having, met, attila, the, hun, in, 452, and, persuading, him, to, turn, back, from, his, invasion, of, italy, he, is, also, a, doctor, of, the, church, most, remembered, theologically, for, issuing, the, tome, of, leo, a, document, which, was, a, major, foundation, to, the, debates, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, the, fourth, ecumenical, council, that, meeting, dealt, primarily, with, christology, and, elucidated, the, orthodox, definition, of, christ, s, being, as, the, hypostatic, union, of, two, natures, divine, and, human, united, in, one, person, with, neither, confusion, nor, division, it, was, followed, by, a, major, schism, associated, with, monophysitism, miaphysitism, and, dyophysitism, he, also, contributed, significantly, to, developing, ideas, of, papal, authority, according, to, the, liber, pontificalis, he, was, a, native, of, tuscany, by, 431, as, a, deacon, he, was, sufficiently, well, known, outside, of, rome, that, john, cassian, dedicated, to, him, the, treatise, against, nestorius, written, at, leo, s, suggestion, about, this, time, cyril, of, alexandria, appealed, to, rome, regarding, a, jurisdictional, dispute, with, juvenal, of, jerusalem, but, it, is, not, entirely, clear, whether, the, letter, was, intended, for, leo, in, his, capacity, as, archdeacon, or, for, pope, celestine, i, directly, near, the, end, of, the, reign, of, pope, sixtus, iii, leo, was, dispatched, at, the, request, of, emperor, valentinian, iii, to, settle, a, dispute, between, a, tius, one, of, gaul, s, chief, military, commanders, and, the, chief, magistrate, albinus, johann, peter, kirsch, sees, this, commission, as, a, proof, of, the, confidence, placed, in, the, able, deacon, by, the, imperial, court, during, leo, s, absence, in, gaul, pope, sixtus, iii, died, on, 11, august, 440, and, on, 29, september, leo, was, unanimously, elected, by, the, people, to, succeed, him, soon, after, assuming, the, papal, throne, leo, learned, that, in, aquileia, pelagians, were, received, into, church, communion, without, formal, repudiation, of, their, heresy, he, censured, this, practice, and, directed, that, a, provincial, synod, be, held, where, such, former, pelagians, be, required, to, make, an, unequivocal, abjuration, leo, claimed, that, manichaeans, possibly, fleeing, vandal, africa, had, come, to, rome, and, secretly, organized, there, in, late, 443, leo, preached, a, series, of, sermons, condemning, the, manichaeans, and, calling, for, romans, to, denounce, suspected, heretics, to, their, priests, eventually, suspected, heretics, were, brought, to, court, and, likely, under, torture, they, confessed, to, various, crimes, by, early, 444, leo, announced, to, the, bishops, of, italy, that, the, manichaeans, had, been, eradicated, from, rome, according, to, his, contemporary, prosper, of, aquitaine, leo, exposed, the, manichaeans, and, burned, their, books, he, was, equally, firm, against, the, priscillianist, sect, bishop, turibius, of, astorga, astonished, at, the, spread, of, the, sect, in, spain, had, addressed, the, other, spanish, bishops, on, the, subject, sending, a, copy, of, his, letter, to, leo, who, took, the, opportunity, to, write, an, extended, treatise, 21, july, 447, against, the, sect, examining, its, false, teaching, in, detail, and, calling, for, a, spanish, general, council, to, investigate, whether, it, had, any, adherents, in, the, episcopate, from, a, pastoral, perspective, he, energized, charitable, works, in, a, rome, beset, by, famines, an, influx, of, refugees, and, poverty, he, further, associated, the, practice, of, fasting, with, charity, and, almsgiving, particularly, on, the, occasion, of, the, quattro, tempora, the, quarterly, ember, days, it, was, during, leo, s, papacy, that, the, term, pope, which, previously, meant, any, bishop, came, to, exclusively, mean, the, bishop, of, rome, leo, drew, many, learned, men, about, him, and, chose, prosper, of, aquitaine, to, act, in, some, secretarial, or, notarial, capacity, leo, was, a, significant, contributor, to, the, centralisation, of, spiritual, authority, within, the, church, and, in, reaffirming, papal, authority, in, 450, the, byzantine, emperor, theodosius, ii, in, a, letter, to, pope, leo, i, was, the, first, to, call, the, bishop, of, rome, the, patriarch, of, the, west, a, title, that, would, continue, to, be, used, by, the, popes, until, the, present, days, only, interrupted, by, a, brief, period, between, 2006, and, 2024, by, 447, he, declared, that, heretics, deserved, the, most, severe, punishments, the, pope, justified, the, death, penalty, declaring, that, if, the, followers, of, a, heresy, were, allowed, to, live, that, would, be, the, end, of, human, and, divine, law, on, several, occasions, leo, was, asked, to, arbitrate, disputes, in, gaul, patroclus, of, arles, d, 426, had, received, from, pope, zosimus, the, recognition, of, a, subordinate, primacy, over, the, gallican, church, which, was, strongly, asserted, by, his, successor, hilary, of, arles, an, appeal, from, chelidonius, of, besan, on, gave, leo, the, opportunity, to, assert, the, pope, s, authority, over, hilary, who, defended, himself, stoutly, at, rome, refusing, to, recognize, leo, s, judicial, status, feeling, that, the, primatial, rights, of, the, bishop, of, rome, were, threatened, leo, appealed, to, the, civil, power, for, support, and, obtained, from, valentinian, iii, a, decree, of, 6, june, 445, which, recognized, the, primacy, of, the, bishop, of, rome, based, on, the, merits, of, peter, the, dignity, of, the, city, and, the, legislation, of, the, first, council, of, nicaea, and, provided, for, the, forcible, extradition, by, provincial, governors, of, any, bishop, who, refused, to, answer, a, summons, to, rome, faced, with, this, decree, hilary, submitted, to, the, pope, although, under, his, successor, ravennius, leo, divided, the, metropolitan, rights, between, arles, and, vienne, 450, in, 445, leo, disputed, with, patriarch, dioscorus, cyril, of, alexandria, s, successor, as, patriarch, of, alexandria, insisting, that, the, ecclesiastical, practice, of, his, see, should, follow, that, of, rome, on, the, basis, that, mark, the, evangelist, the, disciple, of, peter, the, apostle, and, the, founder, of, the, alexandrian, church, could, have, had, no, other, tradition, than, that, of, the, prince, of, the, apostles, the, fact, that, the, african, province, of, mauretania, caesariensis, had, been, preserved, to, the, empire, and, thus, to, the, nicene, faith, during, the, vandal, invasion, and, in, its, isolation, was, disposed, to, rest, on, outside, support, gave, leo, an, opportunity, to, assert, his, authority, there, in, 446, he, wrote, to, the, church, in, mauretania, in, regard, to, a, number, of, questions, of, discipline, stressing, the, point, that, laymen, were, not, to, be, appointed, to, the, episcopate, in, a, letter, to, the, bishops, of, campania, picenum, and, tuscany, 443, he, required, the, observance, of, all, his, precepts, and, those, of, his, predecessors, and, he, sharply, rebuked, the, bishops, of, sicily, 447, for, their, deviation, from, the, roman, custom, as, to, the, time, of, baptism, requiring, them, to, send, delegates, to, the, roman, synod, to, learn, the, proper, practice, because, of, the, earlier, line, of, division, between, the, western, and, eastern, parts, of, the, roman, empire, illyria, was, ecclesiastically, subject, to, rome, pope, innocent, i, had, constituted, the, metropolitan, of, thessalonica, his, vicar, in, order, to, oppose, the, growing, influence, of, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, in, the, area, in, a, letter, of, about, 446, to, a, successor, bishop, of, thessalonica, anastasius, leo, reproached, him, for, the, way, he, had, treated, one, of, the, metropolitan, bishops, subject, to, him, after, giving, various, instructions, about, the, functions, entrusted, to, anastasius, and, stressing, that, certain, powers, were, reserved, to, the, pope, himself, leo, wrote, the, care, of, the, universal, church, should, converge, towards, peter, s, one, seat, and, nothing, anywhere, should, be, separated, from, its, head, he, succeeded, in, having, an, imperial, patriarch, timothy, salophakiolos, and, not, timotheus, aelurus, chosen, as, coptic, orthodox, pope, of, alexandria, on, the, murder, of, greek, patriarch, proterius, of, alexandria, almost, 100, sermons, and, 150, letters, of, leo, i, have, been, preserved, at, the, second, council, of, ephesus, in, 449, leo, s, representatives, delivered, his, famous, tome, a, statement, of, the, faith, of, the, roman, church, in, the, form, of, a, letter, addressed, to, archbishop, flavian, of, constantinople, which, repeats, in, close, adherence, to, augustine, of, hippo, the, formulas, of, western, christology, the, council, did, not, read, the, letter, nor, did, it, pay, any, attention, to, the, protests, of, leo, s, legates, but, deposed, flavian, and, eusebius, of, dorylaeum, who, appealed, to, rome, that, is, one, reason, that, the, council, was, never, recognized, as, ecumenical, and, was, later, repudiated, by, the, council, of, chalcedon, it, was, presented, again, at, the, subsequent, council, of, chalcedon, as, offering, a, solution, to, the, christological, controversies, still, raging, between, east, and, west, eutyches, in, the, beginning, of, the, conflict, appealed, to, leo, and, took, refuge, with, him, on, his, condemnation, by, flavian, but, on, receiving, full, information, from, flavian, leo, took, his, side, decisively, leo, demanded, of, the, emperor, that, an, ecumenical, council, should, be, held, in, italy, and, in, the, meantime, at, a, roman, synod, in, october, 449, repudiated, all, the, decisions, of, the, robber, synod, in, his, letters, to, the, emperor, and, others, he, demanded, the, deposition, of, eutyches, as, a, manichaean, and, docetic, heretic, the, council, of, chalcedon, of, 451, rejected, the, heresy, of, eutyches, who, denied, the, true, human, nature, of, the, son, of, god, and, affirmed, the, union, in, his, one, person, without, confusion, and, without, separation, of, his, two, natures, human, and, divine, the, acts, of, the, council, report, after, the, reading, of, the, foregoing, epistle, the, most, reverend, bishops, cried, out, this, is, the, faith, of, the, fathers, this, is, the, faith, of, the, apostles, so, we, all, believe, thus, the, orthodox, believe, anathema, to, him, who, does, not, thus, believe, peter, has, spoken, thus, through, leo, so, taught, the, apostles, piously, and, truly, did, leo, teach, so, taught, cyril, everlasting, be, the, memory, of, cyril, leo, and, cyril, taught, the, same, thing, anathema, to, him, who, does, not, so, believe, this, is, the, true, faith, those, of, us, who, are, orthodox, thus, believe, this, is, the, faith, of, the, fathers, why, were, not, these, things, read, at, ephesus, these, are, the, things, dioscorus, hid, away, leo, firmly, declined, to, confirm, their, disciplinary, arrangements, which, seemed, to, allow, constantinople, a, practically, equal, authority, with, rome, and, regarded, the, civil, importance, of, a, city, as, a, determining, factor, in, its, ecclesiastical, position, but, he, strongly, supported, its, dogmatic, decrees, especially, when, after, the, accession, of, emperor, leo, i, 457, there, seemed, to, be, a, disposition, toward, compromise, with, the, eutychians, leo, s, writings, sermons, and, letters, mostly, discuss, theological, questions, concerning, the, person, of, jesus, christ, christology, and, his, role, as, mediator, and, savior, soteriology, which, is, partially, connected, to, the, council, of, chalcedon, in, which, roman, legates, represented, leo, subsequently, through, numerous, letters, to, bishops, and, members, of, the, imperial, family, leo, incessantly, worked, for, the, propagation, and, universal, reception, of, the, faith, in, christ, as, defined, by, chalcedon, also, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, roman, empire, leo, defends, both, the, true, divinity, and, true, humanity, of, christ, against, heretical, one, sidedness, he, takes, up, this, topic, also, in, many, of, his, sermons, and, over, the, years, he, further, develops, his, own, original, concepts, a, central, idea, around, which, leo, deepens, and, explains, his, theology, is, christ, s, presence, in, the, church, more, specifically, in, the, teaching, and, preaching, of, the, faith, scripture, tradition, and, their, interpretation, in, the, liturgy, sacraments, and, celebrations, in, the, life, of, the, individual, believer, and, of, the, organized, church, especially, in, a, council, to, leo, the, great, mariology, is, determined, by, christology, if, christ, were, divine, only, everything, about, him, would, be, divine, only, his, divinity, would, have, been, crucified, buried, and, resurrected, mary, would, only, be, the, mother, of, god, and, christians, would, have, no, hope, for, their, own, resurrection, the, nucleus, of, christianity, would, be, destroyed, the, most, unusual, beginning, of, a, truly, human, life, through, her, was, to, give, birth, to, jesus, the, lord, and, son, of, king, david, leo, assumed, the, papacy, at, a, time, of, increasing, barbarian, invasions, this, coupled, with, the, decreasing, imperial, authority, in, the, west, forced, the, bishop, of, rome, to, take, a, more, active, part, in, civil, and, political, affairs, he, was, one, of, the, first, bishops, of, rome, to, promote, papal, primacy, based, on, succession, from, peter, the, apostle, and, he, did, so, as, a, means, of, maintaining, unity, among, the, churches, besides, recourse, to, biblical, language, leo, also, described, his, own, special, relationship, with, peter, in, terms, derived, from, roman, law, he, called, himself, the, unworthy, heir, and, deputy, vicarius, of, peter, having, received, his, apostolic, authority, and, being, obliged, to, follow, his, example, on, the, one, hand, peter, stood, before, him, with, a, claim, on, how, leo, is, to, exercise, his, office, on, the, other, hand, leo, as, the, roman, bishop, represented, the, apostle, whose, authority, he, held, christ, however, always, comes, out, as, the, source, of, all, grace, and, authority, and, leo, is, responsible, to, him, for, how, he, fulfilled, his, duties, sermon, 1, thus, the, office, of, the, roman, bishop, was, grounded, on, the, special, relationship, between, christ, and, peter, a, relationship, that, cannot, be, repeated, per, se, therefore, leo, depended, on, peter, s, mediation, his, assistance, and, his, example, in, order, to, be, able, to, adequately, fulfill, his, role, and, exercise, his, authority, as, the, bishop, of, rome, both, in, the, city, and, beyond, after, the, indecisive, outcome, of, the, battle, of, chalons, in, 451, attila, invaded, italy, in, 452, sacking, cities, such, as, aquileia, and, heading, for, rome, he, allegedly, demanded, that, the, sister, of, the, reigning, emperor, valentinian, iii, be, sent, to, him, with, a, dowry, in, response, the, emperor, sent, three, envoys, to, negotiate, with, attila, gennadius, avienus, one, of, the, consuls, of, 450, memmius, aemilius, trygetius, the, former, urban, prefect, and, leo, little, is, known, of, the, specifics, of, the, negotiations, as, a, result, of, which, attila, withdrew, most, ancient, and, medieval, historians, celebrated, leo, s, actions, giving, him, all, the, credit, for, this, successful, embassy, according, to, prosper, of, aquitaine, who, was, alive, at, the, time, of, the, event, attila, was, so, impressed, by, leo, that, he, withdrew, another, near, contemporary, was, the, historian, priscus, who, records, that, attila, was, dissuaded, from, attacking, rome, by, his, own, men, because, they, feared, he, would, share, the, fate, of, the, visigothic, king, alaric, who, died, shortly, after, sacking, the, city, in, 410, paul, the, deacon, in, the, late, 8th, century, relates, that, an, enormously, huge, man, dressed, in, priestly, robes, and, armed, with, a, sword, visible, only, to, attila, threatened, him, and, his, army, with, death, during, his, discourse, with, leo, and, this, prompted, attila, to, submit, to, his, request, writing, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, religious, skeptic, john, b, bury, remarked, the, fact, of, the, embassy, cannot, be, doubted, the, distinguished, ambassadors, visited, the, hun, s, camp, near, the, south, shore, of, lake, garda, it, is, also, certain, that, attila, suddenly, retreated, but, we, are, at, a, loss, to, know, what, considerations, were, offered, him, to, induce, him, to, depart, it, is, unreasonable, to, suppose, that, this, heathen, king, would, have, cared, for, the, thunders, or, persuasions, of, the, church, the, emperor, refused, to, surrender, honoria, and, it, is, not, recorded, that, money, was, paid, a, trustworthy, chronicle, hands, down, another, account, which, does, not, conflict, with, the, fact, that, an, embassy, was, sent, but, evidently, furnishes, the, true, reasons, which, moved, attila, to, receive, it, favourably, plague, broke, out, in, the, barbarian, host, and, their, food, ran, short, and, at, the, same, time, troops, arrived, from, the, east, sent, by, marcian, to, the, aid, of, italy, if, his, host, was, suffering, from, pestilence, and, if, troops, arrived, from, the, east, we, can, understand, that, attila, was, forced, to, withdraw, but, whatever, terms, were, arranged, he, did, not, pretend, that, they, meant, a, permanent, peace, the, question, of, honoria, was, left, unsettled, and, he, threatened, that, he, would, come, again, and, do, worse, things, in, italy, unless, she, were, given, up, with, the, due, portion, of, the, imperial, possessions, leo, s, intercession, could, not, prevent, the, sack, of, the, city, by, the, vandal, king, genseric, in, 455, but, murder, and, arson, were, repressed, by, his, influence, the, pope, and, members, of, his, clergy, went, to, meet, the, invader, to, implore, him, to, desist, while, the, vandals, plundered, the, city, the, gesture, nevertheless, prevented, rome, from, being, burned, and, assured, that, the, basilicas, of, st, peter, st, paul, and, st, john, in, which, part, of, the, terrified, population, sought, refuge, were, spared, leo, assisted, in, rebuilding, the, city, of, rome, restoring, key, places, such, as, saint, peter, s, in, his, in, nativitate, domini, christmas, day, sermon, christian, remember, your, dignity, leo, articulates, a, fundamental, dignity, common, to, all, christians, whether, saints, or, sinners, and, the, consequent, obligation, to, live, up, to, it, our, saviour, dearly, beloved, was, born, today, let, us, be, glad, for, there, is, no, proper, place, for, sadness, when, we, keep, the, birthday, of, the, life, which, destroys, the, fear, of, mortality, and, brings, to, us, the, joy, of, promised, eternity, no, one, is, kept, from, sharing, in, this, happiness, there, is, for, all, one, common, measure, of, joy, because, as, our, lord, the, destroyer, of, sin, and, death, finds, none, free, from, charge, so, is, he, come, to, free, us, all, let, the, saint, exult, in, that, he, draws, near, to, victory, let, the, sinner, be, glad, in, that, he, is, invited, to, pardon, let, the, gentile, take, courage, in, that, he, is, called, to, life, let, us, put, off, then, the, old, man, with, his, deeds, and, having, obtained, a, share, in, the, birth, of, christ, let, us, renounce, the, works, of, the, flesh, christian, acknowledge, thy, dignity, and, becoming, a, partner, in, the, divine, nature, refuse, to, return, to, the, old, baseness, by, degenerate, conduct, remember, the, head, and, the, body, of, which, thou, art, a, member, recollect, that, thou, wert, rescued, from, the, power, of, darkness, and, brought, out, into, god, s, light, and, kingdom, by, the, mystery, of, baptism, thou, wert, made, the, temple, of, the, holy, ghost, do, not, put, such, a, denizen, to, flight, from, thee, by, base, acts, and, subject, thyself, once, more, to, the, devil, s, thraldom, because, thy, purchase, money, is, the, blood, of, christ, because, he, shall, judge, thee, in, truth, who, ransomed, thee, in, mercy, who, with, the, father, and, the, holy, spirit, reigns, for, ever, and, ever, amen, leo, died, on, 10, november, 461, and, as, he, wished, to, be, buried, as, close, as, possible, to, the, tomb, of, st, peter, his, body, was, entombed, within, the, portico, of, old, st, peter, s, basilica, 11, he, was, the, first, pope, to, be, buried, within, st, peter, s, 11, in, 688, pope, sergius, i, had, leo, s, remains, moved, to, the, south, transept, inside, the, basilica, the, relocation, was, apparently, due, to, the, number, of, later, papal, burials, obscuring, the, prominence, that, sergius, believed, leo, s, tomb, should, have, 40, pope, benedict, xvi, said, that, leo, s, papacy, was, undoubtedly, one, of, the, most, important, in, the, church, s, history, in, 1754, pope, benedict, xiv, proclaimed, leo, i, a, doctor, of, the, church, next, to, leo, only, one, other, pope, gregory, i, is, also, recognized, as, doctor, of, the, church, the, catholic, church, marks, 10, november, as, the, feast, day, of, saint, leo, given, in, the, martyrologium, hieronymianum, and, the, 8th, century, calendar, of, saint, willibrord, as, the, date, of, his, death, and, entry, to, heaven, his, feast, was, once, celebrated, in, rome, on, 28, june, the, anniversary, of, the, placing, of, his, relics, in, saint, peter, s, basilica, but, in, the, 12th, century, the, gallican, rite, feast, of, 11, april, was, admitted, to, the, general, roman, calendar, which, maintained, that, date, until, 1969, the, eastern, catholic, churches, as, well, as, the, eastern, orthodox, church, celebrate, saint, leo, on, 18, february, leo, the, great, is, honored, in, the, church, of, england, and, in, the, episcopal, church, on, 10, november, in, the, roman, rite,
