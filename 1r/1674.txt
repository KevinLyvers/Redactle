peter, joseph, william, debye, formemrs, d, b, a, dutch, march, 24, 1884, november, 2, 1966, was, a, dutch, american, physicist, and, physical, chemist, and, nobel, laureate, in, chemistry, born, petrus, josephus, wilhelmus, debije, in, maastricht, netherlands, debye, enrolled, in, the, aachen, university, of, technology, in, 1901, in, 1905, he, completed, his, first, degree, in, electrical, engineering, he, published, his, first, paper, a, mathematically, elegant, solution, of, a, problem, involving, eddy, currents, in, 1907, at, aachen, he, studied, under, the, theoretical, physicist, arnold, sommerfeld, who, later, claimed, that, his, most, important, discovery, was, peter, debye, in, 1906, sommerfeld, received, an, appointment, at, munich, bavaria, and, took, debye, with, him, as, his, assistant, debye, got, his, ph, d, with, a, dissertation, on, radiation, pressure, in, 1908, in, 1910, he, derived, the, planck, radiation, formula, using, a, method, which, max, planck, agreed, was, simpler, than, his, own, in, 1911, when, albert, einstein, took, an, appointment, as, a, professor, at, prague, bohemia, debye, took, his, old, professorship, at, the, university, of, zurich, switzerland, this, was, followed, by, moves, to, utrecht, in, 1912, to, g, ttingen, in, 1913, to, eth, zurich, in, 1920, to, university, of, leipzig, in, 1927, and, in, 1934, to, berlin, where, succeeding, einstein, he, became, director, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, physics, now, named, the, max, planck, institut, whose, facilities, were, built, only, during, debye, s, era, he, was, awarded, the, lorentz, medal, in, 1935, from, 1937, to, 1939, he, was, the, president, of, the, deutsche, physikalische, gesellschaft, in, may, 1914, he, became, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, and, in, december, of, the, same, year, he, became, foreign, member, peter, debye, was, described, as, a, martinet, when, it, came, to, scientific, principles, yet, he, was, always, approachable, and, made, time, for, his, students, his, personal, philosophy, emphasized, a, fulfillment, of, purpose, and, enjoyment, in, one, s, work, debye, was, an, avid, trout, fisherman, and, gardener, collector, of, cacti, and, was, always, known, to, enjoy, a, nice, cigar, while, in, berlin, as, an, assistant, to, arnold, sommerfeld, debye, became, acquainted, with, mathilde, alberer, mathilde, was, the, daughter, of, the, proprietor, of, the, boarding, house, in, which, debye, was, staying, mathilde, would, soon, change, her, citizenship, and, in, 1913, debye, married, mathilde, alberer, debye, would, enjoy, working, in, his, rose, garden, with, mathilde, alberer, late, into, his, years, they, had, a, son, peter, p, debye, 1916, 2012, and, a, daughter, mathilde, maria, 1921, 1991, peter, became, a, physicist, and, collaborated, with, debye, in, some, of, his, research, and, had, a, son, who, was, also, a, chemist, debye, was, a, faithful, catholic, who, insisted, his, family, go, to, church, his, first, major, scientific, contribution, was, the, application, of, the, concept, of, dipole, moment, to, the, charge, distribution, in, asymmetric, molecules, in, 1912, developing, equations, relating, dipole, moments, to, temperature, and, dielectric, constant, in, consequence, the, units, of, molecular, dipole, moments, are, termed, debyes, in, his, honor, also, in, 1912, he, extended, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, specific, heat, to, lower, temperatures, by, including, contributions, from, low, frequency, phonons, see, debye, model, in, 1913, he, extended, niels, bohr, s, theory, of, atomic, structure, introducing, elliptical, orbits, a, concept, also, introduced, by, arnold, sommerfeld, in, 1914, 1915, debye, calculated, the, effect, of, temperature, on, x, ray, diffraction, patterns, of, crystalline, solids, with, paul, scherrer, the, debye, waller, factor, in, 1923, together, with, his, assistant, erich, h, ckel, he, developed, an, improvement, of, svante, arrhenius, theory, of, electrical, conductivity, in, electrolyte, solutions, although, an, improvement, was, made, to, the, debye, h, ckel, equation, in, 1926, by, lars, onsager, the, theory, is, still, regarded, as, a, major, forward, step, in, our, understanding, of, electrolytic, solutions, also, in, 1923, debye, developed, a, theory, to, explain, the, compton, effect, the, shifting, of, the, frequency, of, x, rays, when, they, interact, with, electrons, from, 1934, to, 1939, debye, was, director, of, the, physics, section, of, the, prestigious, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, in, berlin, from, 1936, onwards, he, was, also, professor, of, theoretical, physics, at, the, frederick, william, university, of, berlin, these, positions, were, held, during, the, nazi, germany, in, germany, and, from, 1938, onward, austria, in, 1939, debye, traveled, to, the, united, states, to, deliver, the, baker, lectures, at, cornell, university, in, ithaca, new, york, after, leaving, germany, in, early, 1940, debye, became, a, professor, at, cornell, chaired, the, chemistry, department, for, 10, years, and, became, a, member, of, alpha, chi, sigma, in, 1946, he, became, an, american, citizen, unlike, the, european, phase, of, his, life, where, he, moved, from, city, to, city, every, few, years, in, the, united, states, debye, remained, at, cornell, for, the, remainder, of, his, career, he, retired, in, 1952, but, continued, research, until, his, death, much, of, debye, s, work, at, cornell, concerned, the, use, of, light, scattering, techniques, derived, from, his, x, ray, scattering, work, of, years, earlier, to, determine, the, size, and, molecular, weight, of, polymer, molecules, this, started, as, a, result, of, his, research, during, world, war, ii, on, synthetic, rubber, but, was, extended, to, proteins, and, other, macromolecules, in, april, 1966, debye, suffered, a, heart, attack, and, in, november, of, that, year, a, second, one, proved, fatal, he, is, buried, in, the, pleasant, grove, cemetery, ithaca, new, york, us, in, january, 2006, a, book, in, dutch, appeared, in, the, netherlands, written, by, sybe, rispens, entitled, einstein, in, the, netherlands, one, chapter, of, this, book, discusses, the, relationship, between, albert, einstein, and, debye, rispens, discovered, documents, that, as, he, believed, were, new, and, proved, that, during, his, directorship, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, debye, was, actively, involved, in, cleansing, german, science, institutions, of, jewish, and, other, non, aryan, elements, rispens, records, that, on, december, 9, 1938, debye, wrote, in, his, capacity, as, chairman, of, the, deutsche, physikalische, gesellschaft, dpg, to, all, the, members, of, the, dpg, in, light, of, the, current, situation, membership, by, german, jews, as, stipulated, by, the, nuremberg, laws, of, the, deutsche, physikalische, gesellschaft, cannot, be, continued, according, to, the, wishes, of, the, board, i, ask, of, all, members, to, whom, these, definitions, apply, to, report, to, me, their, resignation, heil, hitler, many, biographies, published, before, rispens, work, state, that, debye, moved, to, the, us, because, he, refused, to, accept, german, citizenship, forced, on, to, him, by, the, nazis, he, planned, his, departure, from, germany, during, a, visit, with, his, mother, in, maastricht, in, late, 1939, boarded, a, ship, in, genoa, in, january, 1940, and, arrived, in, new, york, in, early, february, 1940, he, immediately, sought, a, permanent, position, in, the, us, and, accepted, such, an, offer, from, cornell, in, june, 1940, that, month, he, crossed, the, us, border, into, canada, and, returned, within, days, on, an, immigration, visa, he, was, able, to, get, his, wife, out, of, germany, and, to, the, us, by, december, 1940, although, his, son, already, was, in, the, us, before, he, departed, peter, debye, s, 19, year, old, daughter, and, his, sister, in, law, did, not, leave, they, lived, in, his, official, residence, in, berlin, and, were, supported, by, debye, s, official, berlin, wages, he, carefully, maintained, an, official, leave, of, absence, for, this, purpose, further, rispens, alleges, that, albert, einstein, in, the, first, half, of, 1940, tried, to, prevent, debye, from, being, appointed, in, the, united, states, at, cornell, einstein, allegedly, wrote, to, his, american, colleagues, i, know, from, a, reliable, source, that, peter, debye, is, still, in, close, contact, with, the, german, nazi, leaders, and, according, to, rispens, called, upon, his, colleagues, to, do, what, they, consider, their, duty, as, american, citizens, to, support, this, rispens, refers, to, a, well, known, letter, from, debye, to, einstein, and, einstein, s, response, to, it, van, ginkel, investigated, 1940, fbi, reports, on, this, matter, and, traced, the, reliable, source, to, a, single, letter, directed, to, einstein, and, written, by, someone, whose, name, is, lost, this, person, was, not, known, personally, to, einstein, and, according, to, einstein, probably, did, not, know, debye, personally, either, moreover, this, accusatory, letter, did, not, reach, einstein, directly, but, was, intercepted, by, british, censors, who, showed, it, to, einstein, einstein, sent, the, british, agent, with, the, letter, to, cornell, and, the, cornell, authorities, told, debye, about, the, affair, thereupon, debye, wrote, his, well, known, 1940, letter, to, einstein, to, which, einstein, answered, the, latter, two, letters, can, be, found, in, the, published, einstein, correspondence, rispens, alleges, that, debye, sent, a, telegram, to, berlin, on, 23, june, 1941, informing, his, previous, employers, that, he, was, able, and, willing, to, resume, his, responsibilities, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institut, presumably, to, maintain, his, leave, of, absence, and, keep, the, berlin, house, and, wages, available, for, his, daughter, a, copy, of, this, telegram, has, not, been, recovered, thus, far, in, summer, 1941, debye, filed, his, intent, to, become, a, us, citizen, and, was, quickly, recruited, in, the, us, to, participate, in, allied, war, research, it, has, been, well, documented, in, many, biographies, and, also, in, rispens, book, that, debye, and, dutch, colleagues, helped, his, jewish, colleague, lise, meitner, in, 1938, 1939, at, great, risk, to, himself, and, his, family, cross, the, dutch, german, border, to, escape, nazi, persecution, and, eventually, obtain, a, position, in, sweden, predating, rispens, work, and, in, contrast, to, it, an, article, by, rechenberg, appeared, 18, years, earlier, concerning, debye, s, letter, the, article, describes, debye, s, missive, in, more, detail, and, presents, a, very, favorable, picture, of, debye, in, his, efforts, to, resist, nazi, activists, moreover, this, article, points, out, that, max, von, laue, well, known, for, his, anti, nazi, views, gave, his, approval, to, the, letter, from, the, dpg, chairman, debye, s, son, peter, p, debye, interviewed, in, 2006, at, age, 89, recollects, that, his, father, was, completely, apolitical, and, that, in, the, privacy, of, their, home, politics, were, never, discussed, according, to, his, son, debye, just, wanted, to, do, his, job, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, and, as, long, as, the, nazis, did, not, bother, him, was, able, to, do, so, he, recalls, that, his, mother, urged, him, the, son, to, stay, in, the, us, in, the, event, of, war, debye, s, son, had, come, to, the, us, on, a, planned, 2, month, vacation, during, the, summer, of, 1939, and, never, returned, to, germany, because, war, broke, out, in, an, opinion, article, published, on, the, debye, institute, website, dr, gijs, van, ginkel, until, april, 2007, senior, managing, director, of, the, vm, debye, instituut, in, utrecht, deplored, this, decision, in, his, article, he, cites, scholars, who, point, out, that, the, dpg, was, able, to, retain, their, threatened, staff, as, long, as, could, be, expected, under, increasing, pressure, from, the, nazis, he, also, puts, forward, the, important, argument, that, when, debye, in, 1950, received, the, max, planck, medal, of, the, dpg, nobody, objected, not, even, the, known, opponent, of, the, national, socialists, max, von, laue, who, would, have, been, in, a, position, to, object, also, einstein, with, his, enormous, prestige, was, still, alive, as, were, other, jewish, scientists, such, as, lise, meitner, and, james, franck, who, both, knew, debye, intimately, none, of, them, protested, against, debye, s, receiving, the, highest, german, scientific, distinction, in, fact, albert, einstein, after, many, years, of, not, participating, in, the, voting, for, the, max, planck, medal, nominees, joined, the, process, again, to, vote, for, debye, maastricht, university, also, announced, that, it, was, reconsidering, its, position, on, the, peter, debye, prijs, voor, natuurwetenschappelijk, onderzoek, peter, debye, prize, for, scientific, research, in, a, reply, on, the, dpg, website, dieter, hoffmann, and, mark, walker, also, conclude, that, debye, was, not, a, nazi, activist, they, remark, that, max, von, laue, also, was, required, and, obliged, as, a, civil, servant, to, sign, letters, with, heil, hitler, they, also, state, that, the, dpg, was, one, of, the, last, scientific, societies, to, purge, the, jewish, members, and, only, very, reluctantly, they, quote, the, response, of, the, reich, university, teachers, league, a, national, socialist, organization, to, the, debye, letter, obviously, the, german, physical, society, is, still, very, backward, and, still, clings, tightly, to, their, dear, jews, it, is, in, fact, remarkable, that, only, because, of, circumstances, beyond, our, control, the, membership, of, jews, can, no, longer, be, maintained, in, may, 2006, the, dutch, nobel, prize, winner, martinus, veltman, who, had, written, the, foreword, to, the, rispen, book, renounced, the, book, s, description, of, peter, debye, withdrew, his, foreword, and, asked, the, board, of, directors, of, utrecht, university, to, rescind, their, decision, to, rename, the, debye, institute, various, historical, investigations, both, in, the, netherlands, and, in, the, us, have, been, carried, out, subsequent, to, the, actions, of, the, university, of, maastricht, the, earliest, of, these, investigations, carried, out, by, the, cornell, university, s, department, of, chemistry, and, chemical, biology, released, a, report, on, 31, may, 2006, which, states, that, based, on, the, information, to, date, we, have, not, found, evidence, supporting, the, accusations, that, debye, was, a, nazi, sympathizer, or, collaborator, or, that, he, held, anti, semitic, views, it, is, important, that, this, be, stated, clearly, since, these, are, the, most, serious, allegations, it, goes, on, to, declare, thus, based, on, the, information, evidence, and, historical, record, known, to, date, we, believe, that, any, action, that, dissociates, debye, s, name, from, the, department, of, chemistry, and, chemical, biology, at, cornell, is, unwarranted, in, june, 2006, it, was, reported, that, the, scientific, director, of, the, formerly, debye, institute, had, been, reprimanded, by, the, board, of, directors, of, the, university, of, utrecht, for, a, new, publication, on, debye, s, war, years, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, too, personally, biased, with, respect, to, the, institute, s, naming, dispute, according, to, the, board, the, book, should, have, been, published, not, as, a, debye, institute, publication, but, as, a, personal, one, the, book, was, banned, by, the, university, of, utrecht, and, both, directors, of, the, former, debye, institute, were, forbidden, to, have, any, further, contact, with, the, press, a, dozen, professors, of, the, physics, faculty, amongst, whom, cees, andriesse, openly, protested, against, the, interventions, of, the, board, and, the, censorship, of, their, protest, by, the, university, in, may, 2007, the, universities, of, utrecht, and, maastricht, announced, that, a, new, committee, headed, by, jan, terlouw, would, advise, them, regarding, the, name, change, also, in, the, beginning, of, 2007, an, official, report, was, announced, to, be, published, by, the, niod, and, authorized, by, the, dutch, education, ministry, then, scheduled, for, fall, 2007, the, report, describes, rispens, presentation, of, debye, as, an, opportunist, who, had, no, objection, to, the, nazis, as, a, caricature, t, can, be, stated, that, debye, was, rightly, called, an, opportunist, after, his, arrival, in, the, united, states, we, have, seen, that, he, showed, himself, to, be, loyal, to, the, dominant, political, system, first, in, the, third, reich, and, then, in, the, united, states, while, at, the, same, time, keeping, the, back, door, open, in, the, third, reich, by, retaining, his, dutch, nationality, in, the, united, states, by, attempting, to, secretly, maintain, some, contacts, with, nazi, germany, via, the, foreign, office, it, concludes, that, debye, s, actions, in, 1933, 45, were, based, on, the, nineteenth, century, positivist, view, of, science, which, saw, research, in, physics, as, generating, blessings, for, humankind, the, report, states, that, by, his, contemporaries, debye, was, considered, an, opportunist, by, some, and, as, a, man, of, highest, character, by, others, the, report, asserts, that, debye, was, not, coerced, by, the, nazis, into, writing, the, infamous, dpg, heil, hitler, letter, and, that, he, also, did, not, follow, the, lead, of, other, societies, in, doing, so, but, rather, other, societies, followed, his, lead, the, niod, report, also, concludes, that, debye, felt, obliged, to, send, the, letter, and, that, it, was, for, him, simply, a, confirmation, of, an, existing, situation, the, report, argues, that, debye, in, the, third, reich, developed, a, survival, method, of, ambiguity, which, allowed, him, to, pursue, his, scientific, career, despite, the, political, turmoil, crucial, to, this, survival, method, was, the, need, to, keep, ready, an, escape, hatch, for, example, in, his, secret, dealings, with, the, nazis, in, 1941, if, needed, yet, the, report, also, states, that, the, picture, of, debye, should, not, be, oversimplified, as, debye, s, actions, were, also, motivated, by, his, loyalty, to, his, daughter, who, had, remained, in, berlin, in, general, debye, developed, a, survival, method, of, ambiguity, that, could, pull, the, wool, over, people, s, eyes, in, january, 2008, the, terlouw, commission, advised, the, boards, of, utrecht, and, maastricht, universities, to, continue, to, use, peter, debye, s, name, for, the, chemistry, and, physics, institute, in, utrecht, and, to, continue, awarding, the, science, prize, in, maastricht, the, commission, concluded, that, debye, was, not, a, party, member, was, not, an, anti, semite, did, not, further, nazi, propaganda, did, not, cooperate, with, the, nazi, war, machine, was, not, a, collaborator, and, yet, also, was, not, a, resistance, hero, he, was, a, rather, pragmatic, flexible, and, brilliant, scientist, idealistic, with, respect, to, the, pursuit, of, science, but, only, superficially, oriented, in, politics, with, respect, to, sending, out, the, dpg, letter, the, commission, concluded, that, debye, found, the, situation, inescapable, the, commission, pointed, out, that, the, royal, dutch, academy, of, sciences, also, took, away, albert, einstein, s, honorary, membership, emphasizing, the, circumstances, in, which, these, decisions, had, been, taken, the, commission, stated, that, now, seventy, years, later, no, judgment, can, be, made, concerning, the, decision, of, debye, to, sign, this, letter, in, the, exceptionally, difficult, circumstances, in, which, he, then, found, himself, nevertheless, the, commission, describes, the, dpg, letter, as, an, extraordinarily, unpleasant, fact, forming, a, dark, page, in, his, life, history, finally, the, commission, concluded, that, based, on, the, niod, report, since, no, bad, faith, on, debye, s, part, has, been, demonstrated, his, good, faith, must, be, assumed, and, recommended, that, the, university, of, utrecht, retain, the, name, of, the, debye, institute, of, nanomaterials, science, and, that, the, university, of, maastricht, continue, to, associate, itself, with, the, peter, debye, prize, utrecht, university, accepted, the, recommendation, maastricht, university, did, not, but, in, february, 2008, the, hustinx, foundation, maastricht, originator, and, sponsor, of, the, peter, debye, prize, announced, that, it, will, continue, to, have, the, prize, awarded, the, city, of, maastricht, debye, s, birthplace, declared, that, it, sees, no, reason, to, change, the, names, of, debye, street, and, debye, square, in, a, 2010, publication, jurrie, reiding, asserts, that, debye, may, have, been, an, mi6, spy, reiding, discovered, that, debye, was, befriended, by, the, well, documented, spy, paul, rosbaud, they, first, met, around, 1930, when, they, were, both, working, as, editors, for, two, scientific, journals, they, collaborated, in, the, escape, of, lise, meitner, in, 1938, according, to, reiding, debye, was, well, connected, in, german, scientific, and, industrial, circles, and, could, have, provided, mi6, with, valuable, information, for, example, as, board, member, of, the, german, academy, for, aviation, research, he, was, acquainted, with, hermann, g, ring, reiding, also, offers, an, explanation, for, debye, s, hasty, departure, on, 16, january, 1940, for, the, united, states, the, date, coincided, with, the, planned, but, later, delayed, german, invasion, of, the, netherlands, a, day, later, information, possibly, provided, to, him, by, rosbaud, this, hypothesis, is, contested, by, philip, ball, as, he, notes, that, friendship, with, rosbaud, is, no, gauge, of, debye, s, political, stance, rosbaud, was, well, connected, with, many, people, and, debye, while, he, was, a, friend, of, rosbaud, s, seems, to, have, also, felt, regard, for, geologist, friedrich, drescher, kaden, an, ardent, nazi
