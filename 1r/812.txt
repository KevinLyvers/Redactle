defunct, edmund, burke, b, r, k, 12, january, 1729, 9, july, 1797, was, an, anglo, irish, statesman, and, philosopher, who, spent, most, of, his, career, in, great, britain, born, in, dublin, burke, served, as, a, member, of, parliament, mp, between, 1766, and, 1794, in, the, house, of, commons, of, great, britain, with, the, whig, party, burke, was, a, proponent, of, underpinning, virtues, with, manners, in, society, and, of, the, importance, of, religious, institutions, for, the, moral, stability, and, good, of, the, state, these, views, were, expressed, in, his, a, vindication, of, natural, society, 1756, he, criticised, the, actions, of, the, british, government, towards, the, american, colonies, including, its, taxation, policies, burke, also, supported, the, rights, of, the, colonists, to, resist, metropolitan, authority, although, he, opposed, the, attempt, to, achieve, independence, he, is, remembered, for, his, support, for, catholic, emancipation, the, impeachment, of, warren, hastings, from, the, east, india, company, and, his, staunch, opposition, to, the, french, revolution, in, his, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, 1790, burke, asserted, that, the, revolution, was, destroying, the, fabric, of, good, society, and, traditional, institutions, of, state, and, society, and, he, condemned, the, persecution, of, the, catholic, church, that, resulted, from, it, this, led, to, his, becoming, the, leading, figure, within, the, conservative, faction, of, the, whig, party, which, he, dubbed, the, old, whigs, as, opposed, to, the, pro, french, revolution, new, whigs, led, by, charles, james, fox, in, the, 19th, century, burke, was, praised, by, both, conservatives, and, liberals, subsequently, in, the, 20th, century, he, became, widely, regarded, especially, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, as, the, philosophical, founder, of, conservatism, along, with, his, ultra, royalist, and, ultramontane, counterpart, joseph, de, maistre, burke, was, born, in, dublin, ireland, his, mother, mary, n, e, nagle, was, a, roman, catholic, who, hailed, from, a, county, cork, family, and, a, cousin, of, the, catholic, educator, nano, nagle, whereas, his, father, richard, a, successful, solicitor, was, a, member, of, the, church, of, ireland, it, remains, unclear, whether, this, is, the, same, richard, burke, who, converted, from, catholicism, the, burgh, burke, dynasty, descends, from, the, anglo, norman, knight, william, de, burgh, who, arrived, in, ireland, in, 1185, following, henry, ii, of, england, s, 1171, invasion, of, ireland, and, is, among, the, chief, gall, or, old, english, families, that, assimilated, into, gaelic, society, the, surname, de, burgh, latinised, as, de, burgo, was, gaelicised, in, irish, as, de, b, rca, or, b, rc, which, over, the, centuries, became, burke, burke, adhered, to, his, father, s, faith, and, remained, a, practising, anglican, throughout, his, life, unlike, his, sister, juliana, who, was, brought, up, as, and, remained, a, roman, catholic, later, his, political, enemies, repeatedly, accused, him, of, having, been, educated, at, the, jesuit, college, of, st, omer, near, calais, france, and, of, harbouring, secret, catholic, sympathies, at, a, time, when, membership, in, the, catholic, church, would, disqualify, him, from, public, office, per, penal, laws, in, ireland, as, burke, told, frances, crewe, mr, burke, s, enemies, often, endeavoured, to, convince, the, world, that, he, had, been, bred, up, in, the, catholic, faith, that, his, family, were, of, it, that, he, himself, had, been, educated, at, st, omer, but, this, was, false, as, his, father, was, a, regular, practitioner, of, the, law, at, dublin, which, he, could, not, be, unless, of, the, established, church, it, so, happened, that, though, mr, b, was, twice, at, paris, he, never, happened, to, go, through, the, town, of, st, omer, after, being, elected, to, the, house, of, commons, burke, took, the, required, oath, of, allegiance, and, abjuration, the, oath, of, supremacy, and, the, declaration, against, transubstantiation, as, a, child, burke, sometimes, spent, time, away, from, the, unhealthy, air, of, dublin, with, his, mother, s, family, near, killavullen, in, the, blackwater, valley, in, county, cork, he, received, his, early, education, at, a, quaker, school, in, ballitore, county, kildare, some, 67, kilometres, 42, mi, from, dublin, and, possibly, like, his, cousin, nano, nagle, at, a, hedge, school, near, killavullen, he, remained, in, correspondence, with, his, schoolmate, from, there, mary, leadbeater, the, daughter, of, the, school, s, owner, throughout, his, life, in, 1744, burke, started, at, trinity, college, dublin, a, protestant, establishment, which, up, until, 1793, did, not, permit, catholics, to, take, degrees, in, 1747, he, set, up, a, debating, society, edmund, burke, s, club, which, in, 1770, merged, with, tcd, s, historical, club, to, form, the, college, historical, society, the, oldest, undergraduate, society, in, the, world, the, minutes, of, the, meetings, of, burke, s, club, remain, in, the, collection, of, the, historical, society, burke, graduated, from, trinity, in, 1748, burke, s, father, wanted, him, to, read, law, and, with, this, in, mind, he, went, to, london, in, 1750, where, he, entered, the, middle, temple, before, soon, giving, up, legal, study, to, travel, in, continental, europe, after, eschewing, the, law, he, pursued, a, livelihood, through, writing, the, late, lord, bolingbroke, s, letters, on, the, study, and, use, of, history, was, published, in, 1752, and, his, collected, works, appeared, in, 1754, this, provoked, burke, into, writing, his, first, published, work, a, vindication, of, natural, society, a, view, of, the, miseries, and, evils, arising, to, mankind, appearing, in, spring, 1756, burke, imitated, bolingbroke, s, style, and, ideas, in, a, reductio, ad, absurdum, of, his, arguments, for, deistic, rationalism, in, order, to, demonstrate, their, absurdity, burke, claimed, that, bolingbroke, s, arguments, against, revealed, religion, could, apply, to, all, social, and, civil, institutions, as, well, lord, chesterfield, and, bishop, warburton, as, well, as, others, initially, thought, that, the, work, was, genuinely, by, bolingbroke, rather, than, a, satire, all, the, reviews, of, the, work, were, positive, with, critics, especially, appreciative, of, burke, s, quality, of, writing, some, reviewers, failed, to, notice, the, ironic, nature, of, the, book, which, led, to, burke, stating, in, the, preface, to, the, second, edition, 1757, that, it, was, a, satire, richard, hurd, believed, that, burke, s, imitation, was, near, perfect, and, that, this, defeated, his, purpose, arguing, that, an, ironist, should, take, care, by, a, constant, exaggeration, to, make, the, ridicule, shine, through, the, imitation, whereas, this, vindication, is, everywhere, enforc, d, not, only, in, the, language, and, on, the, principles, of, l, bol, but, with, so, apparent, or, rather, so, real, an, earnestness, that, half, his, purpose, is, sacrificed, to, the, other, a, minority, of, scholars, have, taken, the, position, that, in, fact, burke, did, write, the, vindication, in, earnest, later, disowning, it, only, for, political, reasons, in, 1757, burke, published, a, treatise, on, aesthetics, titled, a, philosophical, enquiry, into, the, origin, of, our, ideas, of, the, sublime, and, beautiful, that, attracted, the, attention, of, prominent, continental, thinkers, such, as, denis, diderot, and, immanuel, kant, it, was, his, only, purely, philosophical, work, completed, in, 1753, when, asked, by, sir, joshua, reynolds, and, french, laurence, to, expand, it, thirty, years, later, burke, replied, that, he, was, no, longer, fit, for, abstract, speculation, on, 25, february, 1757, burke, signed, a, contract, with, robert, dodsley, to, write, a, history, of, england, from, the, time, of, julius, caesar, to, the, end, of, the, reign, of, queen, anne, its, length, being, eighty, quarto, sheets, 640, pages, nearly, 400, 000, words, it, was, to, be, submitted, for, publication, by, christmas, 1758, burke, completed, the, work, to, the, year, 1216, and, stopped, it, was, not, published, until, after, burke, s, death, in, an, 1812, collection, of, his, works, an, essay, towards, an, abridgement, of, the, english, history, g, m, young, did, not, value, burke, s, history, and, claimed, that, it, was, demonstrably, a, translation, from, the, french, on, commenting, on, the, story, that, burke, stopped, his, history, because, david, hume, published, his, lord, acton, said, it, is, ever, to, be, regretted, that, the, reverse, did, not, occur, during, the, year, following, that, contract, burke, founded, with, dodsley, the, influential, annual, register, a, publication, in, which, various, authors, evaluated, the, international, political, events, of, the, previous, year, the, extent, to, which, burke, contributed, to, the, annual, register, is, unclear, in, his, biography, of, burke, robert, murray, quotes, the, register, as, evidence, of, burke, s, opinions, yet, philip, magnus, in, his, biography, does, not, cite, it, directly, as, a, reference, burke, remained, the, chief, editor, of, the, publication, until, at, least, 1789, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, any, other, writer, contributed, to, it, before, 1766, on, 12, march, 1757, burke, married, jane, mary, nugent, 1734, 1812, daughter, of, dr, christopher, nugent, a, catholic, physician, who, had, provided, him, with, medical, treatment, at, bath, their, son, richard, was, born, on, 9, february, 1758, while, a, second, son, christopher, born, that, december, died, in, infancy, burke, also, helped, raise, a, ward, edmund, nagle, later, admiral, sir, edmund, nagle, the, son, of, a, maternal, cousin, orphaned, in, 1763, at, about, this, same, time, burke, was, introduced, to, william, gerard, hamilton, known, as, single, speech, hamilton, when, hamilton, was, appointed, chief, secretary, for, ireland, burke, accompanied, him, to, dublin, as, his, private, secretary, a, position, he, held, for, three, years, in, 1765, burke, became, private, secretary, to, the, liberal, whig, politician, charles, marquess, of, rockingham, then, prime, minister, of, great, britain, who, remained, burke, s, close, friend, and, associate, until, his, death, in, 1782, in, december, 1765, burke, entered, the, house, of, commons, of, the, british, parliament, as, member, for, wendover, in, buckinghamshire, a, pocket, borough, in, the, gift, of, lord, fermanagh, later, 2nd, earl, verney, and, a, close, political, ally, of, rockingham, after, burke, delivered, his, maiden, speech, william, pitt, the, elder, said, he, had, spoken, in, such, a, manner, as, to, stop, the, mouths, of, all, europe, and, that, the, commons, should, congratulate, itself, on, acquiring, such, a, member, the, first, great, subject, burke, addressed, was, the, controversy, with, the, american, colonies, which, soon, developed, into, war, and, ultimate, separation, in, reply, to, the, 1769, grenvillite, pamphlet, the, present, state, of, the, nation, he, published, his, own, pamphlet, titled, observations, on, a, late, state, of, the, nation, surveying, the, finances, of, france, burke, predicts, some, extraordinary, convulsion, in, that, whole, system, during, the, same, year, with, mostly, borrowed, money, burke, purchased, gregories, a, 600, acre, 2, 4, km, 2, estate, near, beaconsfield, although, the, estate, included, saleable, assets, such, as, art, works, by, titian, gregories, proved, a, heavy, financial, burden, in, the, following, decades, and, burke, was, never, able, to, repay, its, purchase, price, in, full, his, speeches, and, writings, having, made, him, famous, led, to, the, suggestion, that, he, was, the, author, of, the, letters, of, junius, at, about, this, time, burke, joined, the, circle, of, leading, intellectuals, and, artists, in, london, of, whom, samuel, johnson, was, the, central, luminary, this, circle, also, included, david, garrick, oliver, goldsmith, and, joshua, reynolds, edward, gibbon, described, burke, as, the, most, eloquent, and, rational, madman, that, i, ever, knew, although, johnson, admired, burke, s, brilliance, he, found, him, a, dishonest, politician, burke, took, a, leading, role, in, the, debate, regarding, the, constitutional, limits, to, the, executive, authority, of, the, king, he, argued, strongly, against, unrestrained, royal, power, and, for, the, role, of, political, parties, in, maintaining, a, principled, opposition, capable, of, preventing, abuses, either, by, the, monarch, or, by, specific, factions, within, the, government, his, most, important, publication, in, this, regard, was, his, thoughts, on, the, cause, of, the, present, discontents, of, 23, april, 1770, burke, identified, the, discontents, as, stemming, from, the, secret, influence, of, a, neo, tory, group, he, labelled, as, the, king, s, friends, whose, system, comprehending, the, exterior, and, interior, administrations, is, commonly, called, in, the, technical, language, of, the, court, double, cabinet, britain, needed, a, party, with, an, unshaken, adherence, to, principle, and, attachment, to, connexion, against, every, allurement, of, interest, party, divisions, whether, operating, for, good, or, evil, are, things, inseparable, from, free, government, during, 1771, burke, wrote, a, bill, that, would, have, given, juries, the, right, to, determine, what, was, libel, if, passed, burke, spoke, in, favour, of, the, bill, but, it, was, opposed, by, some, including, charles, james, fox, not, becoming, law, when, introducing, his, own, bill, in, 1791, in, opposition, fox, repeated, almost, verbatim, the, text, of, burke, s, bill, without, acknowledgement, burke, was, prominent, in, securing, the, right, to, publish, debates, held, in, parliament, speaking, in, a, parliamentary, debate, on, the, prohibition, on, the, export, of, grain, on, 16, november, 1770, burke, argued, in, favour, of, a, free, market, in, corn, there, are, no, such, things, as, a, high, a, low, price, that, is, encouraging, discouraging, there, is, nothing, but, a, natural, price, which, grain, brings, at, an, universal, market, in, 1772, burke, was, instrumental, in, the, passing, of, the, repeal, of, certain, laws, act, 1772, which, repealed, various, old, laws, against, dealers, and, forestallers, in, corn, in, the, annual, register, for, 1772, published, in, july, 1773, burke, condemned, the, partition, of, poland, he, saw, it, as, the, first, very, great, breach, in, the, modern, political, system, of, europe, and, as, upsetting, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, on, 3, november, 1774, burke, was, elected, member, for, bristol, at, the, time, england, s, second, city, with, a, large, constituency, in, a, genuine, electoral, contest, at, the, conclusion, of, the, poll, he, made, his, speech, to, the, electors, of, bristol, at, the, conclusion, of, the, poll, a, remarkable, disclaimer, of, the, constituent, imperative, form, of, democracy, for, which, he, substituted, his, statement, of, the, representative, mandate, form, he, failed, to, win, re, election, for, that, seat, in, the, subsequent, 1780, general, election, in, may, 1778, burke, supported, a, parliamentary, motion, revising, restrictions, on, irish, trade, his, constituents, citizens, of, the, great, trading, city, of, bristol, urged, burke, to, oppose, free, trade, with, ireland, burke, resisted, their, protestations, and, said, if, from, this, conduct, i, shall, forfeit, their, suffrages, at, an, ensuing, election, it, will, stand, on, record, an, example, to, future, representatives, of, the, commons, of, england, that, one, man, at, least, had, dared, to, resist, the, desires, of, his, constituents, when, his, judgment, assured, him, they, were, wrong, burke, published, two, letters, to, gentlemen, of, bristol, on, the, bills, relative, to, the, trade, of, ireland, in, which, he, espoused, some, of, the, chief, principles, of, commerce, such, as, the, advantage, of, free, intercourse, between, all, parts, of, the, same, kingdom, the, evils, attending, restriction, and, monopoly, and, that, the, gain, of, others, is, not, necessarily, our, loss, but, on, the, contrary, an, advantage, by, causing, a, greater, demand, for, such, wares, as, we, have, for, sale, burke, also, supported, the, attempts, of, sir, george, savile, to, repeal, some, of, the, penal, laws, against, catholics, burke, also, called, capital, punishment, the, butchery, which, we, call, justice, in, 1776, and, in, 1780, condemned, the, use, of, the, pillory, for, two, men, convicted, for, attempting, to, practice, sodomy, this, support, for, unpopular, causes, notably, free, trade, with, ireland, and, catholic, emancipation, led, to, burke, losing, his, seat, in, 1780, for, the, remainder, of, his, parliamentary, career, burke, represented, malton, another, pocket, borough, under, the, marquess, of, rockingham, s, patronage, burke, expressed, his, support, for, the, grievances, of, the, american, thirteen, colonies, under, the, government, of, king, george, iii, and, his, appointed, representatives, on, 19, april, 1774, burke, made, a, speech, on, american, taxation, published, in, january, 1775, on, a, motion, to, repeal, the, tea, duty, again, and, again, revert, to, your, old, principles, seek, peace, and, ensue, it, leave, america, if, she, has, taxable, matter, in, her, to, tax, herself, i, am, not, here, going, into, the, distinctions, of, rights, nor, attempting, to, mark, their, boundaries, i, do, not, enter, into, these, metaphysical, distinctions, i, hate, the, very, sound, of, them, leave, the, americans, as, they, anciently, stood, and, these, distinctions, born, of, our, unhappy, contest, will, die, along, with, it, be, content, to, bind, america, by, laws, of, trade, you, have, always, done, it, do, not, burthen, them, with, taxes, but, if, intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you, sophisticate, and, poison, the, very, source, of, government, by, urging, subtle, deductions, and, consequences, odious, to, those, you, govern, from, the, unlimited, and, illimitable, nature, of, supreme, sovereignty, you, will, teach, them, by, these, means, to, call, that, sovereignty, itself, in, question, if, that, sovereignty, and, their, freedom, cannot, be, reconciled, which, will, they, take, they, will, cast, your, sovereignty, in, your, face, no, body, of, men, will, be, argued, into, slavery, on, 22, march, 1775, burke, delivered, in, the, house, of, commons, a, speech, published, in, may, 1775, on, reconciliation, with, america, burke, appealed, for, peace, as, preferable, to, civil, war, and, reminded, the, house, of, commons, of, america, s, growing, population, its, industry, and, its, wealth, he, warned, against, the, notion, that, the, americans, would, back, down, in, the, face, of, force, since, most, americans, were, of, british, descent, he, people, of, the, colonies, are, descendants, of, englishmen, they, are, therefore, not, only, devoted, to, liberty, but, to, liberty, according, to, english, ideas, and, on, english, principles, the, people, are, protestants, a, persuasion, not, only, favourable, to, liberty, but, built, upon, it, my, hold, of, the, colonies, is, in, the, close, affection, which, grows, from, common, names, from, kindred, blood, from, similar, privileges, and, equal, protection, these, are, ties, which, though, light, as, air, are, as, strong, as, links, of, iron, let, the, colonies, always, keep, the, idea, of, their, civil, rights, associated, with, your, government, they, will, cling, and, grapple, to, you, and, no, force, under, heaven, will, be, of, power, to, tear, them, from, their, allegiance, but, let, it, be, once, understood, that, your, government, may, be, one, thing, and, their, privileges, another, that, these, two, things, may, exist, without, any, mutual, relation, the, cement, is, gone, the, cohesion, is, loosened, and, everything, hastens, to, decay, and, dissolution, as, long, as, you, have, the, wisdom, to, keep, the, sovereign, authority, of, this, country, as, the, sanctuary, of, liberty, the, sacred, temple, consecrated, to, our, common, faith, wherever, the, chosen, race, and, sons, of, england, worship, freedom, they, will, turn, their, faces, towards, you, the, more, they, multiply, the, more, friends, you, will, have, the, more, ardently, they, love, liberty, the, more, perfect, will, be, their, obedience, slavery, they, can, have, anywhere, it, is, a, weed, that, grows, in, every, soil, they, may, have, it, from, spain, they, may, have, it, from, prussia, but, until, you, become, lost, to, all, feeling, of, your, true, interest, and, your, natural, dignity, freedom, they, can, have, from, none, but, you, burke, prized, peace, with, america, above, all, else, pleading, with, the, house, of, commons, to, remember, that, the, interest, by, way, of, money, received, from, the, american, colonies, was, far, more, attractive, than, any, sense, of, putting, the, colonists, in, their, place, the, proposition, is, peace, not, peace, through, the, medium, of, war, not, peace, to, be, hunted, through, the, labyrinth, of, intricate, and, endless, negotiations, not, peace, to, arise, out, of, universal, discord, t, is, simple, peace, sought, in, its, natural, course, and, in, its, ordinary, haunts, it, is, peace, sought, in, the, spirit, of, peace, and, laid, in, principles, purely, pacific, burke, was, not, merely, presenting, a, peace, agreement, to, parliament, but, rather, he, stepped, forward, with, four, reasons, against, using, force, carefully, reasoned, he, laid, out, his, objections, in, an, orderly, manner, focusing, on, one, before, moving, to, the, next, his, first, concern, was, that, the, use, of, force, would, have, to, be, temporary, and, that, the, uprisings, and, objections, to, british, governance, in, colonial, america, would, not, be, second, burke, worried, about, the, uncertainty, surrounding, whether, britain, would, win, a, conflict, in, america, an, armament, burke, said, is, not, a, victory, third, burke, brought, up, the, issue, of, impairment, stating, that, it, would, do, the, british, government, no, good, to, engage, in, a, scorched, earth, war, and, have, the, object, they, desired, america, become, damaged, or, even, useless, the, american, colonists, could, always, retreat, into, the, mountains, but, the, land, they, left, behind, would, most, likely, be, unusable, whether, by, accident, or, design, the, fourth, and, final, reason, to, avoid, the, use, of, force, was, experience, as, the, british, had, never, attempted, to, rein, in, an, unruly, colony, by, force, and, they, did, not, know, if, it, could, be, done, let, alone, accomplished, thousands, of, miles, away, from, home, not, only, were, all, of, these, concerns, reasonable, but, some, turned, out, to, be, prophetic, the, american, colonists, did, not, surrender, even, when, things, looked, extremely, bleak, and, the, british, were, ultimately, unsuccessful, in, their, attempts, to, win, a, war, fought, on, american, soil, it, was, not, temporary, force, uncertainty, impairment, or, even, experience, that, burke, cited, as, the, primary, reason, for, avoiding, war, with, the, american, colonies, rather, it, was, the, character, of, the, american, people, themselves, in, this, character, of, americans, a, love, of, freedom, is, the, predominating, feature, which, marks, and, distinguishes, the, whole, his, fierce, spirit, of, liberty, is, stronger, in, the, english, colonies, probably, than, in, any, other, people, of, the, earth, men, acute, inquisitive, dextrous, prompt, in, attack, ready, in, defence, full, of, resources, burke, concludes, with, another, plea, for, peace, and, a, prayer, that, britain, might, avoid, actions, which, in, burke, s, words, may, bring, on, the, destruction, of, this, empire, burke, proposed, six, resolutions, to, settle, the, american, conflict, peacefully, had, they, been, passed, though, the, effect, of, these, resolutions, can, never, be, known, they, might, have, quelled, the, colonials, revolutionary, spirit, unfortunately, burke, delivered, this, speech, less, than, a, month, before, the, explosive, conflict, at, concord, and, lexington, as, these, resolutions, were, not, enacted, little, was, done, that, would, help, to, prevent, armed, conflict, among, the, reasons, this, speech, was, so, greatly, admired, was, its, passage, on, lord, bathurst, 1684, 1775, in, which, burke, describes, an, angel, in,

samuel, johnson, was, so, irritated, at, hearing, it, continually, praised, that, he, made, a, parody, of, it, where, the, devil, appears, to, a, young, whig, and, predicts, that, in, a, short, time, whiggism, will, poison, even, the, paradise, of, america, the, administration, of, lord, north, 1770, 1782, tried, to, defeat, the, colonist, rebellion, by, military, force, british, and, american, forces, clashed, in, 1775, and, in, 1776, came, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, burke, was, appalled, by, celebrations, in, britain, of, the, defeat, of, the, americans, in, new, york, and, pennsylvania, he, claimed, the, english, national, character, was, being, changed, by, this, authoritarianism, burke, wrote, as, to, the, good, people, of, england, they, seem, to, partake, every, day, more, and, more, of, the, character, of, that, administration, which, they, have, been, induced, to, tolerate, i, am, satisfied, that, within, a, few, years, there, has, been, a, great, change, in, the, national, character, we, seem, no, longer, that, eager, inquisitive, jealous, fiery, people, which, we, have, been, formerly, in, burke, s, view, the, british, government, was, fighting, the, american, english, our, english, brethren, in, the, colonies, with, a, germanic, king, employing, the, hireling, sword, of, german, boors, and, vassals, to, destroy, the, english, liberties, of, the, colonists, on, american, independence, burke, wrote, i, do, not, know, how, to, wish, success, to, those, whose, victory, is, to, separate, from, us, a, large, and, noble, part, of, our, empire, still, less, do, i, wish, success, to, injustice, oppression, and, absurdity, during, the, gordon, riots, in, 1780, burke, became, a, target, of, hostility, and, his, home, was, placed, under, armed, guard, by, the, military, the, fall, of, north, led, to, rockingham, being, recalled, to, power, in, march, 1782, burke, was, appointed, paymaster, of, the, forces, and, a, privy, counsellor, but, without, a, seat, in, cabinet, rockingham, s, unexpected, death, in, july, 1782, and, replacement, with, shelburne, as, prime, minister, put, an, end, to, his, administration, after, only, a, few, months, but, burke, did, manage, to, introduce, two, acts, the, paymaster, general, act, 1782, ended, the, post, as, a, lucrative, sinecure, previously, paymasters, had, been, able, to, draw, on, money, from, hm, treasury, at, their, discretion, instead, now, they, were, required, to, put, the, money, they, had, requested, to, withdraw, from, the, treasury, into, the, bank, of, england, from, where, it, was, to, be, withdrawn, for, specific, purposes, the, treasury, would, receive, monthly, statements, of, the, paymaster, s, balance, at, the, bank, this, act, was, repealed, by, shelburne, s, administration, but, the, act, that, replaced, it, repeated, verbatim, almost, the, whole, text, of, the, burke, act, the, civil, list, and, secret, service, money, act, 1782, was, a, watered, down, version, of, burke, s, original, intentions, as, outlined, in, his, famous, speech, on, economical, reform, of, 11, february, 1780, however, he, managed, to, abolish, 134, offices, in, the, royal, household, and, civil, administration, the, third, secretary, of, state, and, the, board, of, trade, were, abolished, and, pensions, were, limited, and, regulated, the, act, was, anticipated, to, save, 72, 368, a, year, in, february, 1783, burke, resumed, the, post, of, paymaster, of, the, forces, when, shelburne, s, government, fell, and, was, replaced, by, a, coalition, headed, by, north, that, included, charles, james, fox, that, coalition, fell, in, 1783, and, was, succeeded, by, the, long, tory, administration, of, william, pitt, the, younger, which, lasted, until, 1801, accordingly, having, supported, fox, and, north, burke, was, in, opposition, for, the, remainder, of, his, political, life, in, 1774, burke, s, speech, to, the, electors, at, bristol, at, the, conclusion, of, the, poll, was, noted, for, its, defence, of, the, principles, of, representative, government, against, the, notion, that, those, elected, to, assemblies, like, parliament, are, or, should, be, merely, delegates, certainly, gentlemen, it, ought, to, be, the, happiness, and, glory, of, a, representative, to, live, in, the, strictest, union, the, closest, correspondence, and, the, most, unreserved, communication, with, his, constituents, their, wishes, ought, to, have, great, weight, with, him, their, opinion, high, respect, their, business, unremitted, attention, it, is, his, duty, to, sacrifice, his, repose, his, pleasures, his, satisfactions, to, theirs, and, above, all, ever, and, in, all, cases, to, prefer, their, interest, to, his, own, but, his, unbiassed, opinion, his, mature, judgment, his, enlightened, conscience, he, ought, not, to, sacrifice, to, you, to, any, man, or, to, any, sett, of, men, living, these, he, does, not, derive, from, your, pleasure, no, nor, from, the, law, and, the, constitution, they, are, a, trust, from, providence, for, the, abuse, of, which, he, is, deeply, answerable, your, representative, owes, you, not, his, industry, only, but, his, judgment, and, he, betrays, instead, of, serving, you, if, he, sacrifices, it, to, your, opinion, my, worthy, colleague, says, his, will, ought, to, be, subservient, to, yours, if, that, be, all, the, thing, is, innocent, if, government, were, a, matter, of, will, upon, any, side, yours, without, question, ought, to, be, superior, but, government, and, legislation, are, matters, of, reason, and, judgement, and, not, of, inclination, and, what, sort, of, reason, is, that, in, which, the, determination, precedes, the, discussion, in, which, one, sett, of, men, deliberate, and, another, decide, and, where, those, who, form, the, conclusion, are, perhaps, three, hundred, miles, distant, from, those, who, hear, the, arguments, to, deliver, an, opinion, is, the, right, of, all, men, that, of, constituents, is, a, weighty, and, respectable, opinion, which, a, representative, ought, always, to, rejoice, to, hear, and, which, he, ought, always, most, seriously, to, consider, but, authoritative, instructions, mandates, issued, which, the, member, is, bound, blindly, and, implicitly, to, obey, to, vote, and, to, argue, for, though, contrary, to, the, clearest, conviction, of, his, judgment, and, conscience, these, are, things, utterly, unknown, to, the, laws, of, this, land, and, which, arise, from, a, fundamental, mistake, of, the, whole, order, and, tenour, of, our, constitution, parliament, is, not, a, congress, of, ambassadors, from, different, and, hostile, interests, which, interests, each, must, maintain, as, an, agent, and, advocate, against, other, agents, and, advocates, but, parliament, is, a, deliberative, assembly, of, one, nation, with, one, interest, that, of, the, whole, where, not, local, purposes, not, local, prejudices, ought, to, guide, but, the, general, good, resulting, from, the, general, reason, of, the, whole, you, choose, a, member, indeed, but, when, you, have, chosen, him, he, is, not, a, member, of, bristol, but, he, is, a, member, of, parliament, it, is, often, forgotten, in, this, connection, that, burke, as, detailed, below, was, an, opponent, of, slavery, and, therefore, his, conscience, was, refusing, to, support, a, trade, in, which, many, of, his, bristol, electors, were, lucratively, involved, political, scientist, hanna, pitkin, points, out, that, burke, linked, the, interest, of, the, district, with, the, proper, behaviour, of, its, elected, official, explaining, burke, conceives, of, broad, relatively, fixed, interest, few, in, number, and, clearly, defined, of, which, any, group, or, locality, has, just, one, these, interests, are, largely, economic, or, associated, with, particular, localities, whose, livelihood, they, characterize, in, his, over, all, prosperity, they, involve, burke, was, a, leading, sceptic, with, respect, to, democracy, while, admitting, that, theoretically, in, some, cases, it, might, be, desirable, he, insisted, a, democratic, government, in, britain, in, his, day, would, not, only, be, inept, but, also, oppressive, he, opposed, democracy, for, three, basic, reasons, first, government, required, a, degree, of, intelligence, and, breadth, of, knowledge, of, the, sort, that, occurred, rarely, among, the, common, people, second, he, thought, that, if, they, had, the, vote, common, people, had, dangerous, and, angry, passions, that, could, be, aroused, easily, by, demagogues, fearing, that, the, authoritarian, impulses, that, could, be, empowered, by, these, passions, would, undermine, cherished, traditions, and, established, religion, leading, to, violence, and, confiscation, of, property, third, burke, warned, that, democracy, would, create, a, tyranny, over, unpopular, minorities, who, needed, the, protection, of, the, upper, classes, burke, proposed, a, bill, to, ban, slaveholders, from, being, able, to, sit, in, the, house, of, commons, claiming, they, were, a, danger, incompatible, with, traditional, notions, of, british, liberty, he, described, slavery, as, a, weed, that, grows, on, every, soil, while, burke, did, believe, that, africans, were, barbaric, and, needed, to, be, civilised, by, christianity, gregory, collins, argues, that, this, was, not, an, unusual, attitude, amongst, abolitionists, at, the, time, furthermore, burke, seemed, to, believe, that, christianity, would, provide, a, civilising, benefit, to, any, group, of, people, as, he, believed, christianity, had, tamed, european, civilisation, and, regarded, southern, european, peoples, as, equally, savage, and, barbarous, collins, also, suggests, that, burke, viewed, the, uncivilised, behaviour, of, african, slaves, as, being, partially, caused, by, slavery, itself, as, he, believed, that, making, someone, a, slave, stripped, them, of, any, virtues, and, rendered, them, mentally, deficient, regardless, of, race, burke, proposed, a, gradual, program, of, emancipation, called, sketch, of, a, negro, code, which, collins, argues, was, quite, detailed, for, the, time, collins, concludes, that, burke, s, gradualist, position, on, the, emancipation, of, slaves, while, perhaps, seeming, ridiculous, to, some, modern, day, readers, was, nonetheless, sincere, for, years, burke, pursued, impeachment, efforts, against, warren, hastings, formerly, governor, general, of, bengal, that, resulted, in, the, trial, during, 1786, his, interaction, with, the, british, dominion, of, india, began, well, before, hastings, impeachment, trial, for, two, decades, prior, to, the, impeachment, parliament, had, dealt, with, the, indian, issue, this, trial, was, the, pinnacle, of, years, of, unrest, and, deliberation, in, 1781, burke, was, first, able, to, delve, into, the, issues, surrounding, the, east, india, company, when, he, was, appointed, chairman, of, the, commons, select, committee, on, east, indian, affairs, from, that, point, until, the, end, of, the, trial, india, was, burke, s, primary, concern, this, committee, was, charged, to, investigate, alleged, injustices, in, bengal, the, war, with, hyder, ali, and, other, indian, difficulties, while, burke, and, the, committee, focused, their, attention, on, these, matters, a, second, secret, committee, was, formed, to, assess, the, same, issues, both, committee, reports, were, written, by, burke, among, other, purposes, the, reports, conveyed, to, the, indian, princes, that, britain, would, not, wage, war, on, them, along, with, demanding, that, the, east, india, company, should, recall, hastings, this, was, burke, s, first, call, for, substantive, change, regarding, imperial, practices, when, addressing, the, whole, house, of, commons, regarding, the, committee, report, burke, described, the, indian, issue, as, one, that, began, in, commerce, but, ended, in, empire, on, 28, february, 1785, burke, delivered, a, now, famous, speech, the, nabob, of, arcot, s, debts, wherein, he, condemned, the, damage, to, india, by, the, east, india, company, in, the, province, of, the, carnatic, the, indians, had, constructed, a, system, of, reservoirs, to, make, the, soil, fertile, in, a, naturally, dry, region, and, centred, their, society, on, the, husbandry, of, water, these, are, the, monuments, of, real, kings, who, were, the, fathers, of, their, people, testators, to, a, posterity, which, they, embraced, as, their, own, these, are, the, grand, sepulchres, built, by, ambition, but, by, the, ambition, of, an, insatiable, benevolence, which, not, contented, with, reigning, in, the, dispensation, of, happiness, during, the, contracted, term, of, human, life, had, strained, with, all, the, reachings, and, graspings, of, a, vivacious, mind, to, extend, the, dominion, of, their, bounty, beyond, the, limits, of, nature, and, to, perpetuate, themselves, through, generations, of, generations, the, guardians, the, protectors, the, nourishers, of, mankind, burke, claimed, that, the, advent, of, east, india, company, domination, in, india, had, eroded, much, that, was, good, in, these, traditions, and, that, as, a, consequence, of, this, and, the, lack, of, new, customs, to, replace, them, the, indian, populace, under, company, rule, was, needlessly, suffering, he, set, about, establishing, a, set, of, imperial, expectations, whose, moral, foundation, would, in, his, opinion, warrant, an, overseas, empire, on, 4, april, 1786, burke, presented, the, house, of, commons, with, the, article, of, charge, of, high, crimes, and, misdemeanors, against, hastings, the, impeachment, in, westminster, hall, which, did, not, begin, until, 14, february, 1788, would, be, the, first, major, public, discursive, event, of, its, kind, in, england, 589, bringing, the, morality, of, imperialism, to, the, forefront, of, public, perception, burke, was, already, known, for, his, eloquent, rhetorical, skills, and, his, involvement, in, the, trial, only, enhanced, its, popularity, and, significance, 590, burke, s, indictment, fuelled, by, emotional, indignation, branded, hastings, a, captain, general, of, iniquity, who, never, dined, without, creating, a, famine, whose, heart, was, gangrened, to, the, core, and, who, resembled, both, a, spider, of, hell, and, a, ravenous, vulture, devouring, the, carcasses, of, the, dead, the, house, of, commons, eventually, impeached, hastings, but, subsequently, the, house, of, lords, acquitted, him, of, all, charges, initially, burke, did, not, condemn, the, french, revolution, in, a, letter, of, 9, august, 1789, he, wrote, england, gazing, with, astonishment, at, a, french, struggle, for, liberty, and, not, knowing, whether, to, blame, or, to, applaud, the, thing, indeed, though, i, thought, i, saw, something, like, it, in, progress, for, several, years, has, still, something, in, it, paradoxical, and, mysterious, the, spirit, it, is, impossible, not, to, admire, but, the, old, parisian, ferocity, has, broken, out, in, a, shocking, manner, the, events, of, 5, 6, october, 1789, when, a, crowd, of, parisian, women, marched, on, versailles, to, compel, king, louis, xvi, to, return, to, paris, turned, burke, against, it, in, a, letter, to, his, son, richard, burke, dated, 10, october, he, said, this, day, i, heard, from, laurence, who, has, sent, me, papers, confirming, the, portentous, state, of, france, where, the, elements, which, compose, human, society, seem, all, to, be, dissolved, and, a, world, of, monsters, to, be, produced, in, the, place, of, it, where, mirabeau, presides, as, the, grand, anarch, and, the, late, grand, monarch, makes, a, figure, as, ridiculous, as, pitiable, on, 4, november, charles, jean, fran, ois, depont, wrote, to, burke, requesting, that, he, endorse, the, revolution, burke, replied, that, any, critical, language, of, it, by, him, should, be, taken, as, no, more, than, the, expression, of, doubt, but, he, added, you, may, have, subverted, monarchy, but, not, recover, d, freedom, in, the, same, month, he, described, france, as, a, country, undone, burke, s, first, public, condemnation, of, the, revolution, occurred, during, the, debate, in, parliament, on, the, army, estimates, on, 9, february, 1790, provoked, by, praise, of, the, revolution, by, pitt, and, fox, since, the, house, had, been, prorogued, in, the, summer, much, work, was, done, in, france, the, french, had, shewn, themselves, the, ablest, architects, of, ruin, that, had, hitherto, existed, in, the, world, in, that, very, short, space, of, time, they, had, completely, pulled, down, to, the, ground, their, monarchy, their, church, their, nobility, their, law, their, revenue, their, army, their, navy, their, commerce, their, arts, and, their, manufactures, an, imitation, of, the, excesses, of, an, irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscating, plundering, ferocious, bloody, and, tyrannical, democracy, the, danger, of, their, example, is, no, longer, from, intolerance, but, from, atheism, a, foul, unnatural, vice, foe, to, all, the, dignity, and, consolation, of, mankind, which, seems, in, france, for, a, long, time, to, have, been, embodied, into, a, faction, accredited, and, almost, avowed, in, january, 1790, burke, read, richard, price, s, sermon, of, 4, november, 1789, entitled, a, discourse, on, the, love, of, our, country, to, the, revolution, society, that, society, had, been, founded, to, commemorate, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, in, this, sermon, price, espoused, the, philosophy, of, universal, rights, of, men, price, argued, that, love, of, our, country, does, not, imply, any, conviction, of, the, superior, value, of, it, to, other, countries, or, any, particular, preference, of, its, laws, and, constitution, of, government, instead, price, asserted, that, englishmen, should, see, themselves, more, as, citizens, of, the, world, than, as, members, of, any, particular, community, a, debate, between, price, and, burke, ensued, that, was, the, classic, moment, at, which, two, fundamentally, different, conceptions, of, national, identity, were, presented, to, the, english, public, price, claimed, that, the, principles, of, the, glorious, revolution, included, the, right, to, choose, our, own, governors, to, cashier, them, for, misconduct, and, to, frame, a, government, for, ourselves, immediately, after, reading, price, s, sermon, burke, wrote, a, draft, of, what, eventually, became, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, on, 13, february, 1790, a, notice, in, the, press, said, that, shortly, burke, would, publish, a, pamphlet, on, the, revolution, and, its, british, supporters, but, he, spent, the, year, revising, and, expanding, it, on, 1, november, he, finally, published, the, reflections, and, it, was, an, immediate, best, seller, priced, at, five, shillings, it, was, more, expensive, than, most, political, pamphlets, but, by, the, end, of, 1790, it, had, gone, through, ten, printings, and, sold, approximately, 17, 500, copies, a, french, translation, appeared, on, 29, november, and, on, 30, november, the, translator, pierre, ga, ton, dupont, wrote, to, burke, saying, 2, 500, copies, had, already, been, sold, the, french, translation, ran, to, ten, printings, by, june, 1791, what, the, glorious, revolution, had, meant, was, as, important, to, burke, and, his, contemporaries, as, it, had, been, for, the, last, one, hundred, years, in, british, politics, in, the, reflections, burke, argued, against, price, s, interpretation, of, the, glorious, revolution, and, instead, gave, a, classic, whig, defence, of, it, burke, argued, against, the, idea, of, abstract, metaphysical, rights, of, humans, and, instead, advocated, national, tradition, the, revolution, was, made, to, preserve, our, antient, indisputable, laws, and, liberties, and, that, antient, constitution, of, government, which, is, our, only, security, for, law, and, liberty, the, very, idea, of, the, fabrication, of, a, new, government, is, enough, to, fill, us, with, disgust, and, horror, we, wished, at, the, period, of, the, revolution, and, do, now, wish, to, derive, all, we, possess, as, an, inheritance, from, our, forefathers, upon, that, body, and, stock, of, inheritance, we, have, taken, care, not, to, inoculate, any, cyon, alien, to, the, nature, of, the, original, plant, our, oldest, reformation, is, that, of, magna, charta, you, will, see, that, sir, edward, coke, that, great, oracle, of, our, law, and, indeed, all, the, great, men, who, follow, him, to, blackstone, are, industrious, to, prove, the, pedigree, of, our, liberties, they, endeavour, to, prove, that, the, ancient, charter, were, nothing, more, than, a, re, affirmance, of, the, still, more, ancient, standing, law, of, the, kingdom, in, the, famous, law, called, the, petition, of, right, the, parliament, says, to, the, king, your, subjects, have, inherited, this, freedom, claiming, their, franchises, not, on, abstract, principles, as, the, rights, of, men, but, as, the, rights, of, englishmen, and, as, a, patrimony, derived, from, their, forefathers, burke, said, we, fear, god, we, look, up, with, awe, to, kings, with, affection, to, parliaments, with, duty, to, magistrates, with, reverence, to, priests, and, with, respect, to, nobility, why, because, when, such, ideas, are, brought, before, our, minds, it, is, natural, to, be, so, affected, burke, defended, this, prejudice, on, the, grounds, that, it, is, the, general, bank, and, capital, of, nations, and, of, ages, and, superior, to, individual, reason, which, is, small, in, comparison, prejudice, burke, claimed, is, of, ready, application, in, the, emergency, it, previously, engages, the, mind, in, a, steady, course, of, wisdom, and, virtue, and, does, not, leave, the, man, hesitating, in, the, moment, of, decision, sceptical, puzzled, and, unresolved, prejudice, renders, a, man, s, virtue, his, habit, burke, criticised, social, contract, theory, by, claiming, that, society, is, indeed, a, contract, although, it, is, a, partnership, not, only, between, those, who, are, living, but, between, those, who, are, living, those, who, are, dead, and, those, who, are, to, be, born, the, most, famous, passage, in, burke, s, reflections, was, his, description, of, the, events, of, 5, 6, october, 1789, and, the, part, of, marie, antoinette, in, them, burke, s, account, differs, little, from, modern, historians, who, have, used, primary, sources, his, use, of, flowery, language, to, describe, it, provoked, both, praise, and, criticism, philip, francis, wrote, to, burke, saying, that, what, he, wrote, of, marie, antoinette, was, pure, foppery, edward, gibbon, reacted, differently, i, adore, his, chivalry, burke, was, informed, by, an, englishman, who, had, talked, with, the, duchesse, de, biron, that, when, marie, antoinette, was, reading, the, passage, she, burst, into, tears, and, took, considerable, time, to, finish, reading, it, price, had, rejoiced, that, the, french, king, had, been, led, in, triumph, during, the, october, days, but, to, burke, this, symbolised, the, opposing, revolutionary, sentiment, of, the, jacobins, and, the, natural, sentiments, of, those, who, shared, his, own, view, with, horror, that, the, ungallant, assault, on, marie, antoinette, was, a, cowardly, attack, on, a, defenceless, woman, louis, xvi, translated, the, reflections, from, end, to, end, into, french, fellow, whig, mps, richard, sheridan, and, charles, james, fox, disagreed, with, burke, and, split, with, him, fox, thought, the, reflections, to, be, in, very, bad, taste, and, favouring, tory, principles, other, whigs, such, as, the, duke, of, portland, and, earl, fitzwilliam, privately, agreed, with, burke, but, they, did, not, wish, for, a, public, breach, with, their, whig, colleagues, burke, wrote, on, 29, november, 1790, i, have, received, from, the, duke, of, portland, lord, fitzwilliam, the, duke, of, devonshire, lord, john, cavendish, montagu, frederick, montagu, mp, and, a, long, et, cetera, of, the, old, stamina, of, the, whiggs, a, most, full, approbation, of, the, principles, of, that, work, and, a, kind, indulgence, to, the, execution, the, duke, of, portland, said, in, 1791, that, when, anyone, criticised, the, reflections, to, him, he, informed, them, that, he, had, recommended, the, book, to, his, sons, as, containing, the, true, whig, creed, in, the, opinion, of, paul, langford, burke, crossed, something, of, a, rubicon, when, he, attended, a, levee, on, 3, february, 1791, to, meet, the, king, later, described, by, jane, burke, as, follows, on, his, coming, to, town, for, the, winter, as, he, generally, does, he, went, to, the, levee, with, the, duke, of, portland, who, went, with, lord, william, to, kiss, hands, on, his, going, into, the, guards, while, lord, william, was, kissing, hands, the, king, was, talking, to, the, duke, but, his, eyes, were, fixed, on, who, was, standing, in, the, crowd, and, when, he, said, his, say, to, the, duke, without, waiting, for, s, coming, up, in, his, turn, the, king, went, up, to, him, and, after, the, usual, questions, of, how, long, have, you, been, in, town, and, the, weather, he, said, you, have, been, very, much, employed, of, late, and, very, much, confined, said, no, sir, not, more, than, usual, you, have, and, very, well, employed, too, but, there, are, none, so, deaf, as, those, that, w, ont, hear, and, none, so, blind, as, those, that, w, ont, see, made, a, low, bow, sir, i, certainly, now, understand, you, but, was, afraid, my, vanity, or, presumption, might, have, led, me, to, imagine, what, your, majesty, has, said, referred, to, what, i, have, done, you, cannot, be, vain, you, have, been, of, use, to, us, all, it, is, a, general, opinion, is, it, not, so, lord, stair, who, was, standing, near, it, is, said, lord, stair, your, majesty, s, adopting, it, sir, will, make, the, opinion, general, said, i, know, it, is, the, general, opinion, and, i, know, that, there, is, no, man, who, calls, himself, a, gentleman, that, must, not, think, himself, obliged, to, you, for, you, have, supported, the, cause, of, the, gentlemen, you, know, the, tone, at, court, is, a, whisper, but, the, king, said, all, this, loud, so, as, to, be, heard, by, every, one, at, court, burke, s, reflections, sparked, a, pamphlet, war, mary, wollstonecraft, was, one, of, the, first, into, print, publishing, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, men, a, few, weeks, after, burke, thomas, paine, followed, with, the, rights, of, man, in, 1791, james, mackintosh, who, wrote, vindiciae, gallicae, was, the, first, to, see, the, reflections, as, the, manifesto, of, a, counter, revolution, mackintosh, later, agreed, with, burke, s, views, remarking, in, december, 1796, after, meeting, him, that, burke, was, minutely, and, accurately, informed, to, a, wonderful, exactness, with, respect, to, every, fact, relating, to, the, french, revolution, mackintosh, later, said, burke, was, one, of, the, first, thinkers, as, well, as, one, of, the, greatest, orators, of, his, time, he, is, without, parallel, in, any, age, excepting, perhaps, lord, bacon, and, cicero, and, his, works, contain, an, ampler, store, of, political, and, moral, wisdom, than, can, be, found, in, any, other, writer, whatever, in, november, 1790, fran, ois, louis, thibault, de, menonville, a, member, of, the, national, assembly, of, france, wrote, to, burke, praising, reflections, and, requesting, more, very, refreshing, mental, food, that, he, could, publish, this, burke, did, in, april, 1791, when, he, published, a, letter, to, a, member, of, the, national, assembly, burke, called, for, external, forces, to, reverse, the, revolution, and, included, an, attack, on, the, late, french, philosopher, jean, jacques, rousseau, as, being, the, subject, of, a, personality, cult, that, had, developed, in, revolutionary, france, although, burke, conceded, that, rousseau, sometimes, showed, a, considerable, insight, into, human, nature, he, mostly, was, critical, although, he, did, not, meet, rousseau, on, his, visit, to, britain, in, 1766, 1767, burke, was, a, friend, of, david, hume, with, whom, rousseau, had, stayed, burke, said, rousseau, entertained, no, principle, either, to, influence, of, his, heart, or, to, guide, his, understanding, but, vanity, which, he, was, possessed, to, a, degree, little, short, of, madness, he, also, cited, rousseau, s, confessions, as, evidence, that, rousseau, had, a, life, of, obscure, and, vulgar, vices, that, was, not, chequered, or, spotted, here, and, there, with, virtues, or, even, distinguished, by, a, single, good, action, burke, contrasted, rousseau, s, theory, of, universal, benevolence, and, his, having, sent, his, children, to, a, foundling, hospital, stating, that, he, was, a, lover, of, his, kind, but, a, hater, of, his, kindred, these, events, and, the, disagreements, that, arose, from, them, within, the, whigs, led, to, its, break, up, and, to, the, rupture, of, burke, s, friendship, with, fox, in, a, debate, in, parliament, on, britain, s, relations, with, russia, fox, praised, the, principles, of, the, revolution, although, burke, was, not, able, to, reply, at, this, time, as, he, was, overpowered, by, continued, cries, of, question, from, his, own, side, of, the, house, when, parliament, was, debating, the, quebec, bill, for, a, constitution, for, canada, fox, praised, the, revolution, and, criticised, some, of, burke, s, arguments, such, as, hereditary, power, on, 6, may, 1791, burke, used, the, opportunity, to, answer, fox, during, another, debate, in, parliament, on, the, quebec, bill, and, condemn, the, new, french, constitution, and, the, horrible, consequences, flowing, from, the, french, idea, of, the, rights, of, man, burke, asserted, that, those, ideas, were, the, antithesis, of, both, the, british, and, the, american, constitutions, burke, was, interrupted, and, fox, intervened, saying, that, burke, should, be, allowed, to, carry, on, with, his, speech, however, a, vote, of, censure, was, moved, against, burke, for, noticing, the, affairs, of, france, which, was, moved, by, lord, sheffield, and, seconded, by, fox, pitt, made, a, speech, praising, burke, and, fox, made, a, speech, both, rebuking, and, complimenting, burke, he, questioned, the, sincerity, of, burke, who, seemed, to, have, forgotten, the, lessons, he, had, learned, from, him, quoting, from, burke, s, own, speeches, of, fourteen, and, fifteen, years, before, burke, s, response, was, as, follows, it, certainly, was, indiscreet, at, any, period, but, especially, at, his, time, of, life, to, parade, enemies, or, give, his, friends, occasion, to, desert, him, yet, if, his, firm, and, steady, adherence, to, the, british, constitution, placed, him, in, such, a, dilemma, he, would, risk, all, and, as, public, duty, and, public, experience, taught, him, with, his, last, words, exclaim, fly, from, the, french, constitution, at, this, point, fox, whispered, that, there, was, no, loss, of, friendship, i, regret, to, say, there, is, burke, replied, i, have, indeed, made, a, great, sacrifice, i, have, done, my, duty, though, i, have, lost, my, friend, there, is, something, in, the, detested, french, constitution, that, envenoms, every, thing, it, touches, this, provoked, a, reply, from, fox, yet, he, was, unable, to, give, his, speech, for, some, time, since, he, was, overcome, with, tears, and, emotion, fox, appealed, to, burke, to, remember, their, inalienable, friendship, but, he, also, repeated, his, criticisms, of, burke, and, uttered, unusually, bitter, sarcasms, this, only, aggravated, the, rupture, between, the, two, men, burke, demonstrated, his, separation, from, the, party, on, 5, june, 1791, by, writing, to, fitzwilliam, declining, money, from, him, burke, was, dismayed, that, some, whigs, instead, of, reaffirming, the, principles, of, the, whig, party, he, laid, out, in, the, reflections, had, rejected, them, in, favour, of, french, principles, and, that, they, criticised, burke, for, abandoning, whig, principles, burke, wanted, to, demonstrate, his, fidelity, to, whig, principles, and, feared, that, acquiescence, to, fox, and, his, followers, would, allow, the, whig, party, to, become, a, vehicle, for, jacobinism, burke, knew, that, many, members, of, the, whig, party, did, not, share, fox, s, views, and, he, wanted, to, provoke, them, into, condemning, the, french, revolution, burke, wrote, that, he, wanted, to, represent, the, whole, whig, party, as, tolerating, and, by, a, toleration, countenancing, those, proceedings, so, that, he, could, stimulate, them, to, a, public, declaration, of, what, every, one, of, their, acquaintance, privately, knows, to, be, their, sentiments, on, 3, august, 1791, burke, published, his, appeal, from, the, new, to, the, old, whigs, in, which, he, renewed, his, criticism, of, the, radical, revolutionary, programmes, inspired, by, the, french, revolution, and, attacked, the, whigs, who, supported, them, as, holding, principles, contrary, to, those, traditionally, held, by, the, whig, party, burke, owned, two, copies, of, what, has, been, called, that, practical, compendium, of, whig, political, theory, namely, the, tryal, of, dr, henry, sacheverell, 1710, burke, wrote, of, the, trial, it, rarely, happens, to, a, party, to, have, the, opportunity, of, a, clear, authentic, recorded, declaration, of, their, political, tenets, upon, the, subject, of, a, great, constitutional, event, like, that, of, the, revolution, writing, in, the, third, person, burke, asserted, in, his, appeal, foundations, laid, down, by, the, commons, on, the, trial, of, doctor, sacheverel, for, justifying, the, revolution, of, 1688, are, the, very, same, laid, down, in, mr, burke, s, reflections, that, is, to, say, a, breach, of, the, original, contract, implied, and, expressed, in, the, constitution, of, this, country, as, a, scheme, of, government, fundamentally, and, inviolably, fixed, in, king, lords, and, commons, that, the, fundamental, subversion, of, this, antient, constitution, by, one, of, its, parts, having, been, attempted, and, in, effect, accomplished, justified, the, revolution, that, it, was, justified, only, upon, the, necessity, of, the, case, as, the, only, means, left, for, the, recovery, of, that, antient, constitution, formed, by, the, original, contract, of, the, british, state, as, well, as, for, the, future, preservation, of, the, same, government, these, are, the, points, to, be, proved, burke, then, provided, quotations, from, paine, s, rights, of, man, to, demonstrate, what, the, new, whigs, believed, burke, s, belief, that, foxite, principles, corresponded, to, paine, s, was, genuine, finally, burke, denied, that, a, majority, of, the, people, had, or, ought, to, have, the, final, say, in, politics, and, alter, society, at, their, pleasure, people, had, rights, but, also, duties, and, these, duties, were, not, voluntary, according, to, burke, the, people, could, not, overthrow, morality, derived, from, god, although, whig, grandees, such, as, portland, and, fitzwilliam, privately, agreed, with, burke, s, appeal, they, wished, he, had, used, more, moderate, language, fitzwilliam, saw, the, appeal, as, containing, the, doctrines, i, have, sworn, by, long, and, long, since, francis, basset, a, backbench, whig, mp, wrote, to, burke, that, though, for, reasons, which, i, will, not, now, detail, i, did, not, then, deliver, my, sentiments, i, most, perfectly, differ, from, mr, fox, from, the, great, body, of, opposition, on, the, french, revolution, burke, sent, a, copy, of, the, appeal, to, the, king, and, the, king, requested, a, friend, to, communicate, to, burke, that, he, had, read, it, with, great, satisfaction, burke, wrote, of, its, reception, not, one, word, from, one, of, our, party, they, are, secretly, galled, they, agree, with, me, to, a, title, but, they, dare, not, speak, out, for, fear, of, hurting, fox, they, leave, me, to, myself, they, see, that, i, can, do, myself, justice, charles, burney, viewed, it, as, a, most, admirable, book, the, best, most, useful, on, political, subjects, that, i, have, ever, seen, but, he, believed, the, differences, in, the, whig, party, between, burke, and, fox, should, not, be, aired, publicly, eventually, most, of, the, whigs, sided, with, burke, and, gave, their, support, to, william, pitt, the, younger, s, tory, government, which, in, response, to, france, s, declaration, of, war, against, britain, declared, war, on, france, s, revolutionary, government, in, 1793, in, december, 1791, burke, sent, government, ministers, his, thoughts, on, french, affairs, where, he, put, forward, three, main, points, namely, that, no, counter, revolution, in, france, would, come, about, by, purely, domestic, causes, that, the, longer, the, revolutionary, government, exists, the, stronger, it, becomes, and, that, the, revolutionary, government, s, interest, and, aim, is, to, disturb, all, of, the, other, governments, of, europe, as, a, whig, burke, did, not, wish, to, see, an, absolute, monarchy, again, in, france, after, the, extirpation, of, jacobinism, writing, to, an, migr, in, 1791, burke, expressed, his, views, against, a, restoration, of, the, ancien, r, gime, when, such, a, complete, convulsion, has, shaken, the, state, and, hardly, left, any, thing, whatsoever, either, in, civil, arrangements, or, in, the, characters, and, disposition, of, men, s, minds, exactly, where, it, was, whatever, shall, be, settled, although, in, the, former, persons, and, upon, old, forms, will, be, in, some, measure, a, new, thing, and, will, labour, under, something, of, the, weakness, as, well, as, other, inconveniences, of, a, change, my, poor, opinion, is, that, you, mean, to, establish, what, you, call, l, ancien, r, gime, if, any, one, means, that, system, of, court, intrigue, miscalled, a, government, as, it, stood, at, versailles, before, the, present, confusions, as, the, thing, to, be, established, that, i, believe, will, be, found, absolutely, impossible, and, if, you, consider, the, nature, as, well, of, persons, as, of, affairs, i, flatter, myself, you, must, be, of, my, opinion, that, was, tho, not, so, violent, a, state, of, anarchy, as, well, as, the, present, if, it, were, even, possible, to, lay, things, down, exactly, as, they, stood, before, the, series, of, experimental, politicks, began, i, am, quite, sure, that, they, could, not, long, continue, in, that, situation, in, one, sense, of, l, ancien, r, gime, i, am, clear, that, nothing, else, can, reasonably, be, done, burke, delivered, a, speech, on, the, debate, of, the, aliens, bill, on, 28, december, 1792, he, supported, the, bill, as, it, would, exclude, murderous, atheists, who, would, pull, down, church, and, state, religion, and, god, morality, and, happiness, the, peroration, included, a, reference, to, a, french, order, for, 3, 000, daggers, burke, revealed, a, dagger, he, had, concealed, in, his, coat, and, threw, it, to, the, floor, this, is, what, you, are, to, gain, by, an, alliance, with, france, burke, picked, up, the, dagger, and, continued, when, they, smile, i, see, blood, trickling, down, their, faces, i, see, their, insidious, purposes, i, see, that, the, object, of, all, their, cajoling, is, blood, i, now, warn, my, countrymen, to, beware, of, these, execrable, philosophers, whose, only, object, it, is, to, destroy, every, thing, that, is, good, here, and, to, establish, immorality, and, murder, by, precept, and, example, hic, niger, est, hunc, tu, romane, caveto, burke, supported, the, war, against, revolutionary, france, seeing, britain, as, fighting, on, the, side, of, the, royalists, and, migres, in, a, civil, war, rather, than, fighting, against, the, whole, nation, of, france, burke, also, supported, the, royalist, uprising, in, la, vend, e, describing, it, on, 4, november, 1793, in, a, letter, to, william, windham, as, the, sole, affair, i, have, much, heart, in, burke, wrote, to, henry, dundas, on, 7, october, urging, him, to, send, reinforcements, there, as, he, viewed, it, as, the, only, theatre, in, the, war, that, might, lead, to, a, march, on, paris, but, dundas, did, not, follow, burke, s, advice, burke, believed, the, british, government, was, not, taking, the, uprising, seriously, enough, a, view, reinforced, by, a, letter, he, had, received, from, the, prince, charles, of, france, s, a, r, le, comte, d, artois, dated, 23, october, requesting, that, he, intercede, on, behalf, of, the, royalists, to, the, government, burke, was, forced, to, reply, on, 6, november, i, am, not, in, his, majesty, s, service, or, at, all, consulted, in, his, affairs, burke, published, his, remarks, on, the, policy, of, the, allies, with, respect, to, france, begun, in, october, where, he, said, i, am, sure, every, thing, has, shewn, us, that, in, this, war, with, france, one, frenchman, is, worth, twenty, foreigners, la, vend, e, is, a, proof, of, this, on, 20, june, 1794, burke, received, a, vote, of, thanks, from, the, house, of, commons, for, his, services, in, the, hastings, trial, and, he, immediately, resigned, his, seat, being, replaced, by, his, son, richard, a, blow, fell, upon, burke, with, the, loss, of, richard, in, august, 1794, to, whom, he, was, tenderly, attached, and, in, whom, he, saw, signs, of, promise, which, were, not, patent, to, others, and, which, in, fact, appear, to, have, been, non, existent, although, this, view, may, have, rather, reflected, the, fact, that, his, son, richard, had, worked, successfully, in, the, early, battle, for, catholic, emancipation, king, george, iii, whose, favour, he, had, gained, by, his, attitude, on, the, french, revolution, wished, to, create, him, earl, of, beaconsfield, but, the, death, of, his, son, deprived, the, opportunity, of, such, an, honour, and, all, its, attractions, so, the, only, award, he, would, accept, was, a, pension, of, 2, 500, even, this, modest, reward, was, attacked, by, the, duke, of, bedford, and, the, earl, of, lauderdale, to, whom, burke, replied, in, his, letter, to, a, noble, lord, 1796, it, cannot, at, this, time, be, too, often, repeated, line, upon, line, precept, upon, precept, until, it, comes, into, the, currency, of, a, proverb, to, innovate, is, not, to, reform, he, argued, that, he, was, rewarded, on, merit, but, the, duke, of, bedford, received, his, rewards, from, inheritance, alone, his, ancestor, being, the, original, pensioner, mine, was, from, a, mild, and, benevolent, sovereign, his, from, henry, the, eighth, burke, also, hinted, at, what, would, happen, to, such, people, if, their, revolutionary, ideas, were, implemented, and, included, a, description, of, the, british, constitution, but, as, to, our, country, and, our, race, as, long, as, the, well, compacted, structure, of, our, church, and, state, the, sanctuary, the, holy, of, holies, of, that, ancient, law, defended, by, reverence, defended, by, power, a, fortress, at, once, and, a, temple, shall, stand, inviolate, on, the, brow, of, the, british, sion, as, long, as, the, british, monarchy, not, more, limited, than, fenced, by, the, orders, of, the, state, shall, like, the, proud, keep, of, windsor, rising, in, the, majesty, of, proportion, and, girt, with, the, double, belt, of, its, kindred, and, coeval, towers, as, long, as, this, awful, structure, shall, oversee, and, guard, the, subjected, land, so, long, as, the, mounds, and, dykes, of, the, low, fat, bedford, level, will, have, nothing, to, fear, from, all, the, pickaxes, of, all, the, levellers, of, france, burke, s, last, publications, were, the, letters, on, a, regicide, peace, october, 1796, called, forth, by, negotiations, for, peace, with, france, by, the, pitt, government, burke, regarded, this, as, appeasement, injurious, to, national, dignity, and, honour, in, his, second, letter, burke, wrote, of, the, french, revolutionary, government, individuality, is, left, out, of, their, scheme, of, government, the, state, is, all, in, all, everything, is, referred, to, the, production, of, force, afterwards, everything, is, trusted, to, the, use, of, it, it, is, military, in, its, principle, in, its, maxims, in, its, spirit, and, in, all, its, movements, the, state, has, dominion, and, conquest, for, its, sole, objects, dominion, over, minds, by, proselytism, over, bodies, by, arms, this, is, held, to, be, the, first, explanation, of, the, modern, concept, of, totalitarian, state, burke, regarded, the, war, with, france, as, ideological, against, an, armed, doctrine, he, wished, that, france, would, not, be, partitioned, due, to, the, effect, this, would, have, on, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, and, that, the, war, was, not, against, france, but, against, the, revolutionaries, governing, her, burke, said, it, is, not, france, extending, a, foreign, empire, over, other, nations, it, is, a, sect, aiming, at, universal, empire, and, beginning, with, the, conquest, of, france, in, november, 1795, there, was, a, debate, in, parliament, on, the, high, price, of, corn, and, burke, wrote, a, memorandum, to, pitt, on, the, subject, in, december, samuel, whitbread, mp, introduced, a, bill, giving, magistrates, the, power, to, fix, minimum, wages, and, fox, said, he, would, vote, for, it, this, debate, probably, led, burke, to, edit, his, memorandum, as, there, appeared, a, notice, that, burke, would, soon, publish, a, letter, on, the, subject, to, the, secretary, of, the, board, of, agriculture, arthur, young, but, he, failed, to, complete, it, these, fragments, were, inserted, into, the, memorandum, after, his, death, and, published, posthumously, in, 1800, as, thoughts, and, details, on, scarcity, in, it, burke, expounded, some, of, the, doctrines, of, political, economists, bearing, upon, agriculture, as, a, trade, burke, criticised, policies, such, as, maximum, prices, and, state, regulation, of, wages, and, set, out, what, the, limits, of, government, should, be, that, the, state, ought, to, confine, itself, to, what, regards, the, state, or, the, creatures, of, the, state, namely, the, exterior, establishment, of, its, religion, its, magistracy, its, revenue, its, military, force, by, sea, and, land, the, corporations, that, owe, their, existence, to, its, fiat, in, a, word, to, every, thing, that, is, truly, and, properly, public, to, the, public, peace, to, the, public, safety, to, the, public, order, to, the, public, prosperity, the, economist, adam, smith, remarked, that, burke, was, the, only, man, i, ever, knew, who, thinks, on, economic, subjects, exactly, as, i, do, without, any, previous, communications, having, passed, between, us, writing, to, a, friend, in, may, 1795, burke, surveyed, the, causes, of, discontent, i, think, i, can, hardly, overrate, the, malignity, of, the, principles, of, protestant, ascendency, as, they, affect, ireland, or, of, indianism, as, they, affect, these, countries, and, as, they, affect, asia, or, of, jacobinism, as, they, affect, all, europe, and, the, state, of, human, society, itself, the, last, is, the, greatest, evil, by, march, 1796, burke, had, changed, his, mind, our, government, and, our, laws, are, beset, by, two, different, enemies, which, are, sapping, its, foundations, indianism, and, jacobinism, in, some, cases, they, act, separately, in, some, they, act, in, conjunction, but, of, this, i, am, sure, that, the, first, is, the, worst, by, far, and, the, hardest, to, deal, with, and, for, this, amongst, other, reasons, that, it, weakens, discredits, and, ruins, that, force, which, ought, to, be, employed, with, the, greatest, credit, and, energy, against, the, other, and, that, it, furnishes, jacobinism, with, its, strongest, arms, against, all, formal, government, for, more, than, a, year, prior, to, his, death, burke, knew, that, his, stomach, was, irrecoverably, ruind, after, hearing, that, burke, was, nearing, death, fox, wrote, to, mrs, burke, enquiring, after, him, fox, received, the, reply, the, next, day, mrs, burke, presents, her, compliments, to, mr, fox, and, thanks, him, for, his, obliging, inquiries, mrs, burke, communicated, his, letter, to, mr, burke, and, by, his, desire, has, to, inform, mr, fox, that, it, has, cost, mr, burke, the, most, heart, felt, pain, to, obey, the, stern, voice, of, his, duty, in, rending, asunder, a, long, friendship, but, that, he, deemed, this, sacrifice, necessary, that, his, principles, continue, the, same, and, that, in, whatever, of, life, may, yet, remain, to, him, he, conceives, that, he, must, live, for, others, and, not, for, himself, mr, burke, is, convinced, that, the, principles, which, he, has, endeavoured, to, maintain, are, necessary, to, the, welfare, and, dignity, of, his, country, and, that, these, principles, can, be, enforced, only, by, the, general, persuasion, of, his, sincerity, burke, died, in, beaconsfield, buckinghamshire, on, 9, july, 1797, and, was, buried, there, alongside, his, son, and, brother, burke, is, regarded, by, most, political, historians, in, the, english, speaking, world, as, a, liberal, conservative, and, the, father, of, modern, british, conservatism, burke, was, utilitarian, and, empirical, in, his, arguments, while, joseph, de, maistre, a, fellow, european, conservative, was, more, providentialist, and, sociological, and, deployed, a, more, confrontational, tone, in, his, arguments, burke, believed, that, property, was, essential, to, human, life, because, of, his, conviction, that, people, desire, to, be, ruled, and, controlled, the, division, of, property, formed, the, basis, for, social, structure, helping, develop, control, within, a, property, based, hierarchy, he, viewed, the, social, changes, brought, on, by, property, as, the, natural, order, of, events, which, should, be, taking, place, as, the, human, race, progressed, with, the, division, of, property, and, the, class, system, he, also, believed, that, it, kept, the, monarch, in, check, to, the, needs, of, the, classes, beneath, the, monarch, since, property, largely, aligned, or, defined, divisions, of, social, class, class, too, was, seen, as, natural, part, of, a, social, agreement, that, the, setting, of, persons, into, different, classes, is, the, mutual, benefit, of, all, subjects, concern, for, property, is, not, burke, s, only, influence, christopher, hitchens, summarises, as, follows, if, modern, conservatism, can, be, held, to, derive, from, burke, it, is, not, just, because, he, appealed, to, property, owners, in, behalf, of, stability, but, also, because, he, appealed, to, an, everyday, interest, in, the, preservation, of, the, ancestral, and, the, immemorial, burke, s, support, for, the, causes, of, the, oppressed, majorities, such, as, irish, catholics, and, indians, led, him, to, be, at, the, receiving, end, of, hostile, criticism, from, tories, while, his, opposition, to, the, spread, of, the, french, republic, and, its, radical, ideals, across, europe, led, to, similar, charges, from, whigs, as, a, consequence, burke, often, became, isolated, in, parliament, in, the, 19th, century, burke, was, praised, by, both, liberals, and, conservatives, burke, s, friend, philip, francis, wrote, that, burke, was, a, man, who, truly, prophetically, foresaw, all, the, consequences, which, would, rise, from, the, adoption, of, the, french, principles, but, because, burke, wrote, with, so, much, passion, people, were, doubtful, of, his, arguments, william, windham, spoke, from, the, same, bench, in, the, house, of, commons, as, burke, had, when, he, had, separated, from, fox, and, an, observer, said, windham, spoke, like, the, ghost, of, burke, when, he, made, a, speech, against, peace, with, france, in, 1801, william, hazlitt, a, political, opponent, of, burke, regarded, him, as, amongst, his, three, favourite, writers, the, others, being, junius, and, rousseau, and, made, it, a, test, of, the, sense, and, candour, of, any, one, belonging, to, the, opposite, party, whether, he, allowed, burke, to, be, a, great, man, william, wordsworth, was, originally, a, supporter, of, the, french, revolution, and, attacked, burke, in, a, letter, to, the, bishop, of, llandaff, 1793, but, by, the, early, 19th, century, he, had, changed, his, mind, and, came, to, admire, burke, in, his, two, addresses, to, the, freeholders, of, westmorland, wordsworth, called, burke, the, most, sagacious, politician, of, his, age, whose, predictions, time, has, verified, he, later, revised, his, poem, the, prelude, to, include, praise, of, burke, genius, of, burke, forgive, the, pen, seduced, by, specious, wonders, and, portrayed, him, as, an, old, oak, samuel, taylor, coleridge, came, to, have, a, similar, conversion, as, he, had, criticised, burke, in, the, watchman, but, in, his, friend, 1809, 1810, had, defended, burke, from, charges, of, inconsistency, later, in, his, biographia, literaria, 1817, coleridge, hails, burke, as, a, prophet, and, praises, burke, for, referring, habitually, to, principles, he, was, a, scientific, statesman, and, therefore, a, seer, henry, brougham, wrote, of, burke, that, all, his, predictions, save, one, momentary, expression, had, been, more, than, fulfilled, anarchy, and, bloodshed, had, borne, sway, in, france, conquest, and, convulsion, had, desolated, europe, he, providence, of, mortals, is, not, often, able, to, penetrate, so, far, as, this, into, futurity, george, canning, believed, that, burke, s, reflections, has, been, justified, by, the, course, of, subsequent, events, and, almost, every, prophecy, has, been, strictly, fulfilled, in, 1823, canning, wrote, that, he, took, burke, s, last, works, and, words, the, manual, of, my, politics, the, conservative, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, was, deeply, penetrated, with, the, spirit, and, sentiment, of, burke, s, later, writings, the, 19th, century, liberal, prime, minister, william, gladstone, considered, burke, a, magazine, of, wisdom, on, ireland, and, america, and, in, his, diary, recorded, made, many, extracts, from, burke, sometimes, almost, divine, the, radical, mp, and, anti, corn, law, activist, richard, cobden, often, praised, burke, s, thoughts, and, details, on, scarcity, the, liberal, historian, lord, acton, considered, burke, one, of, the, three, greatest, liberals, along, with, gladstone, and, thomas, babington, macaulay, lord, macaulay, recorded, in, his, diary, i, have, now, finished, reading, again, most, of, burke, s, works, admirable, the, greatest, man, since, milton, the, gladstonian, liberal, mp, john, morley, published, two, books, on, burke, including, a, biography, and, was, influenced, by, burke, including, his, views, on, prejudice, the, cobdenite, radical, francis, hirst, thought, burke, deserved, a, place, among, english, libertarians, even, though, of, all, lovers, of, liberty, and, of, all, reformers, he, was, the, most, conservative, the, least, abstract, always, anxious, to, preserve, and, renovate, rather, than, to, innovate, in, politics, he, resembled, the, modern, architect, who, would, restore, an, old, house, instead, of, pulling, it, down, to, construct, a, new, one, on, the, site, burke, s, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, was, controversial, at, the, time, of, its, publication, but, after, his, death, it, was, to, become, his, best, known, and, most, influential, work, and, a, manifesto, for, conservative, thinking, two, contrasting, assessments, of, burke, also, were, offered, long, after, his, death, by, karl, marx, and, winston, churchill, in, a, footnote, to, volume, one, of, das, kapital, marx, wrote, the, sycophant, who, in, the, pay, of, the, english, oligarchy, played, the, romantic, laudator, temporis, acti, against, the, french, revolution, just, as, in, the, pay, of, the, north, american, colonies, at, the, beginning, of, the, american, troubles, he, had, played, the, liberal, against, the, english, oligarchy, was, an, out, and, out, vulgar, bourgeois, the, laws, of, commerce, are, the, laws, of, nature, and, therefore, the, laws, of, god, e, burke, l, c, pp, 31, 32, no, wonder, that, true, to, the, laws, of, god, and, nature, he, always, sold, himself, in, the, best, market, in, consistency, in, politics, churchill, wrote, on, the, one, hand, is, revealed, as, a, foremost, apostle, of, liberty, on, the, other, as, the, redoubtable, champion, of, authority, but, a, charge, of, political, inconsistency, applied, to, this, life, appears, a, mean, and, petty, thing, history, easily, discerns, the, reasons, and, forces, which, actuated, him, and, the, immense, changes, in, the, problems, he, was, facing, which, evoked, from, the, same, profound, mind, and, sincere, spirit, these, entirely, contrary, manifestations, his, soul, revolted, against, tyranny, whether, it, appeared, in, the, aspect, of, a, domineering, monarch, and, a, corrupt, court, and, parliamentary, system, or, whether, mouthing, the, watch, words, of, a, non, existent, liberty, it, towered, up, against, him, in, the, dictation, of, a, brutal, mob, and, wicked, sect, no, one, can, read, the, burke, of, liberty, and, the, burke, of, authority, without, feeling, that, here, was, the, same, man, pursuing, the, same, ends, seeking, the, same, ideals, of, society, and, government, and, defending, them, from, assaults, now, from, one, extreme, now, from, the, other, the, historian, piers, brendon, asserts, that, burke, laid, the, moral, foundations, for, the, british, empire, epitomised, in, the, trial, of, warren, hastings, that, was, ultimately, to, be, its, undoing, when, burke, stated, that, he, british, empire, must, be, governed, on, a, plan, of, freedom, for, it, will, be, governed, by, no, other, this, was, an, ideological, bacillus, that, would, prove, fatal, this, was, edmund, burke, s, paternalistic, doctrine, that, colonial, government, was, a, trust, it, was, to, be, so, exercised, for, the, benefit, of, subject, people, that, they, would, eventually, attain, their, birthright, freedom, as, a, consequence, of, these, opinions, burke, objected, to, the, opium, trade, which, he, called, a, smuggling, adventure, and, condemned, the, great, disgrace, of, the, british, character, in, india, according, to, political, scientist, jennifer, pitts, burke, was, arguably, the, first, political, thinker, to, undertake, a, comprehensive, critique, of, british, imperial, practice, in, the, name, of, justice, for, those, who, suffered, from, its, moral, and, political, exclusions, a, royal, society, of, arts, blue, plaque, commemorates, burke, at, 37,

preparatory, school, in, washington, edmund, burke, school, burke, avenue, in, the, bronx, new, york, is, named, for, him, one, of, burke, s, largest, and, most, developed, critics, was, the, american, political, theorist, leo, strauss, in, his, book, natural, right, and, history, strauss, makes, a, series, of, points, in, which, he, somewhat, harshly, evaluates, burke, s, writings, one, of, the, topics, that, he, first, addresses, is, the, fact, that, burke, creates, a, definitive, separation, between, happiness, and, virtue, and, explains, that, burke, therefore, seeks, the, foundation, of, government, in, a, conformity, to, our, duties, and, not, in, imaginary, rights, of, man, strauss, views, burke, as, believing, that, government, should, focus, solely, on, the, duties, that, a, man, should, have, in, society, as, opposed, to, trying, to, address, any, additional, needs, or, desires, government, is, simply, a, practicality, to, burke, and, not, necessarily, meant, to, function, as, a, tool, to, help, individuals, live, as, well, as, possible, strauss, also, argues, that, in, a, sense, burke, s, theory, could, be, seen, as, opposing, the, very, idea, of, forming, such, philosophies, burke, expresses, the, view, that, theory, cannot, adequately, predict, future, occurrences, and, therefore, men, need, to, have, instincts, that, cannot, be, practised, or, derived, from, ideology, this, leads, to, an, overarching, criticism, that, strauss, holds, regarding, burke, which, is, his, rejection, of, the, use, of, logic, burke, dismisses, a, widely, held, view, amongst, theorists, that, reason, should, be, the, primary, tool, in, the, forming, of, a, constitution, or, contract, burke, instead, believes, that, constitutions, should, be, made, based, on, natural, processes, as, opposed, to, rational, planning, for, the, future, however, strauss, points, out, that, criticising, rationality, actually, works, against, burke, s, original, stance, of, returning, to, traditional, ways, because, some, amount, of, human, reason, is, inherent, and, therefore, is, in, part, grounded, in, tradition, in, regards, to, this, formation, of, legitimate, social, order, strauss, does, not, necessarily, support, burke, s, opinion, that, order, cannot, be, established, by, individual, wise, people, but, exclusively, by, a, culmination, of, individuals, with, historical, knowledge, of, past, functions, to, use, as, a, foundation, strauss, notes, that, burke, would, oppose, more, newly, formed, republics, due, to, this, thought, although, lenzner, adds, the, fact, that, he, did, seem, to, believe, that, america, s, constitution, could, be, justified, given, the, specific, circumstances, on, the, other, hand, france, s, constitution, was, much, too, radical, as, it, relied, too, heavily, on, enlightened, reasoning, as, opposed, to, traditional, methods, and, values, burke, s, religious, writing, comprises, published, works, and, commentary, on, the, subject, of, religion, burke, s, religious, thought, was, grounded, in, the, belief, that, religion, is, the, foundation, of, civil, society, he, sharply, criticised, deism, and, atheism, and, emphasised, christianity, as, a, vehicle, of, social, progress, born, in, ireland, to, a, catholic, mother, and, a, protestant, father, burke, vigorously, defended, the, church, of, england, but, he, also, demonstrated, sensitivity, to, catholic, concerns, he, linked, the, conservation, of, a, state, established, religion, with, the, preservation, of, citizens, constitutional, liberties, and, highlighted, christianity, s, benefit, not, only, to, the, believer, s, soul, but, also, to, political, arrangements, the, well, known, maxim, that, the, only, thing, necessary, for, the, triumph, of, evil, is, for, good, men, to, do, nothing, is, widely, misattributed, to, burke, it, is, known, that, in, 1770, burke, wrote, the, following, passage, in, thoughts, on, the, cause, of, the, present, discontents, hen, bad, men, combine, the, good, must, associate, else, they, will, fall, one, by, one, an, unpitied, sacrifice, in, a, contemptible, struggle, in, 1867, john, stuart, mill, made, a,
