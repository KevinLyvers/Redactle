motecuhzoma, xocoyotzin, c, 1466, 29, june, 1520, referred, to, retroactively, in, european, sources, as, moctezuma, ii, was, the, ninth, emperor, of, the, aztec, empire, also, known, as, the, mexica, empire, reigning, from, 1502, or, 1503, to, 1520, through, his, marriage, with, queen, tlapalizquixochtzin, of, ecatepec, one, of, his, two, wives, he, was, also, king, consort, of, that, altepetl, the, first, contact, between, the, indigenous, civilizations, of, mesoamerica, and, europeans, took, place, during, his, reign, he, was, killed, during, the, initial, stages, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, when, conquistador, hern, n, cort, s, and, his, men, fought, to, take, over, the, aztec, capital, tenochtitlan, during, his, reign, the, aztec, empire, reached, its, greatest, size, through, warfare, motecuhzoma, expanded, the, territory, as, far, south, as, xoconosco, in, chiapas, and, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, and, incorporated, the, zapotec, and, yopi, people, into, the, empire, he, changed, the, previous, meritocratic, system, of, social, hierarchy, and, widened, the, divide, between, pipiltin, nobles, and, macehualtin, commoners, by, prohibiting, commoners, from, working, in, the, royal, palaces, though, two, other, aztec, rulers, succeeded, motecuhzoma, after, his, death, including, aurelia, bo, their, reigns, were, short, lived, and, the, empire, quickly, collapsed, under, them, historical, portrayals, of, motecuhzoma, have, mostly, been, colored, by, his, role, as, ruler, of, a, defeated, nation, and, many, sources, have, described, him, as, weak, willed, superstitious, and, indecisive, depictions, of, his, person, among, his, contemporaries, however, are, divided, some, depict, him, as, one, of, the, greatest, leaders, mexico, had, a, great, conqueror, who, tried, his, best, to, maintain, his, nation, together, at, times, of, crisis, while, others, depict, him, as, a, tyrant, who, wanted, to, take, absolute, control, over, the, whole, empire, accounts, of, how, he, died, and, who, were, the, perpetrators, spaniards, or, natives, differ, his, story, remains, one, of, the, most, well, known, conquest, narratives, from, the, history, of, european, contact, with, native, americans, and, he, has, been, mentioned, or, portrayed, in, numerous, works, of, historical, fiction, and, popular, culture, the, classical, nahuatl, pronunciation, of, his, name, is, it, is, a, compound, of, a, noun, meaning, lord, and, a, verb, meaning, to, frown, in, anger, and, so, is, interpreted, as, he, frowns, like, a, lord, or, he, who, is, angry, in, a, noble, manner, his, name, glyph, shown, in, the, upper, left, corner, of, the, image, from, the, codex, mendoza, below, was, composed, of, a, diadem, xiuhuitzolli, on, straight, hair, with, an, attached, earspool, a, separate, nosepiece, and, a, speech, scroll, the, aztecs, did, not, use, regnal, numbers, they, were, given, retroactively, by, historians, to, more, easily, distinguish, him, from, the, first, moctezuma, referred, to, as, moctezuma, i, the, aztec, chronicles, called, him, motecuhzoma, xocoyotzin, while, the, first, was, called, motecuhzoma, ilhuicamina, or, huehuemotecuhzoma, old, moctezuma, xocoyotzin, ipa, means, honored, young, one, from, xocoyotl, younger, son, suffix, tzin, added, to, nouns, or, personal, names, when, speaking, about, them, with, deference, moctezuma, ii, was, the, great, grandson, of, moctezuma, i, through, his, daughter, atotoztli, ii, and, her, husband, huehue, tezoz, moc, not, to, be, confused, with, the, tepanec, leader, according, to, some, sources, tezoz, moc, was, the, son, of, emperor, itzc, atl, which, would, make, moctezuma, his, great, grandson, but, other, sources, claim, that, tezoz, moc, was, chimalpopoca, s, son, thus, nephew, of, itzc, atl, and, a, lord, in, ecatepec, moctezuma, was, also, nezahualc, yotl, s, grandson, he, was, a, son, of, emperor, axay, catl, and, one, of, nezahualc, yotl, s, daughters, izelcoatzin, or, xochicueyetl, two, of, his, uncles, were, t, zoc, and, ahuizotl, the, two, previous, emperors, as, was, customary, among, mexica, nobles, moctezuma, was, educated, in, the, calmecac, the, educational, institution, for, the, nobility, he, would, have, been, enrolled, into, the, institution, at, a, very, early, age, likely, at, the, age, of, five, years, as, the, sons, of, the, kings, were, expected, to, receive, their, education, at, a, much, earlier, age, than, the, rest, of, the, population, according, to, some, sources, moctezuma, stood, out, in, his, childhood, for, his, discipline, during, his, education, finishing, his, works, correctly, and, being, devout, to, the, aztec, religion, moctezuma, was, an, already, famous, warrior, by, the, time, he, became, the, tlatoani, of, mexico, holding, the, high, rank, of, tlacatecuhtli, lord, of, men, and, or, tlacochcalcatl, person, from, the, house, of, darts, in, the, mexica, military, and, thus, his, election, was, largely, influenced, by, his, military, career, and, religious, influence, as, a, priest, as, he, was, also, the, main, priest, of, huitzilopochtli, s, temple, one, example, of, a, celebrated, campaign, in, which, he, participated, before, ascending, to, the, throne, was, during, the, last, stages, of, the, conquest, of, ayotlan, during, ahuizotl, s, reign, in, the, late, 15th, century, during, this, campaign, which, lasted, 4, years, a, group, of, mexica, pochteca, merchants, were, put, under, siege, by, the, enemy, forces, this, was, important, because, the, merchants, were, closely, related, to, ahuizotl, and, served, as, military, commanders, and, soldiers, themselves, when, needed, to, rescue, the, merchants, ahuizotl, sent, then, prince, moctezuma, with, many, soldiers, to, fight, against, the, enemies, though, the, fight, was, brief, as, the, people, of, ayotlan, surrendered, to, the, mexica, shortly, after, he, arrived, approximately, in, the, year, 1490, moctezuma, obtained, the, rank, of, tequihua, which, was, reached, by, capturing, at, least, 4, enemy, commanders, the, year, in, which, moctezuma, was, crowned, is, uncertain, most, historians, suggest, the, year, 1502, to, be, most, likely, though, some, have, argued, in, favor, of, the, year, 1503, a, work, currently, held, at, the, art, institute, of, chicago, known, as, the, stone, of, the, five, suns, is, an, inscription, written, in, stone, representing, the, five, suns, and, a, date, le, 11, reed, which, is, equivalent, to, 15, july, 1503, in, the, gregorian, calendar, some, historians, believe, this, to, be, the, exact, date, on, which, the, coronation, took, place, as, it, is, also, included, in, some, primary, sources, other, dates, have, been, given, from, the, same, year, fernando, de, alva, cort, s, ixtlilx, chitl, states, that, the, coronation, took, place, on, 24, may, 1503, however, most, documents, say, moctezuma, s, coronation, happened, in, the, year, 1502, and, therefore, most, historians, believe, this, to, have, been, the, actual, date, after, his, coronation, moctezuma, set, up, thirty, eight, more, provincial, divisions, largely, to, centralize, the, empire, he, sent, out, bureaucrats, accompanied, by, military, garrisons, who, made, sure, tax, was, being, paid, national, laws, were, being, upheld, and, served, as, local, judges, in, case, of, disagreement, moctezuma, s, reign, began, with, difficulties, in, the, year, 1505, a, major, drought, resulted, in, widespread, crop, failure, and, thus, a, large, portion, of, the, population, of, central, mexico, began, to, starve, one, of, the, few, places, in, the, empire, not, affected, by, this, drought, was, totonacapan, and, many, people, from, tenochtitlan, and, tlatelolco, sought, refuge, in, this, region, to, avoid, starvation, large, amounts, of, maize, were, brought, from, this, area, to, aid, the, population, moctezuma, and, the, lords, of, texcoco, and, tlacopan, nezahualpilli, and, totoquihuatzin, attempted, to, aid, the, population, during, the, disaster, including, using, all, available, food, supplies, to, feed, the, population, and, raising, tributes, for, one, year, the, drought, and, famine, ultimately, lasted, three, years, and, at, some, point, became, so, severe, that, some, noblemen, reportedly, sold, their, children, as, slaves, in, exchange, for, food, to, avoid, starvation, moctezuma, ordered, the, tlacxitlan, the, criminal, court, of, tenochtitlan, which, aside, from, judging, criminals, also, had, the, job, of, freeing, unjustified, slaves, to, free, those, children, and, offer, food, to, those, noblemen, another, natural, disaster, of, lesser, intensity, occurred, in, the, winter, of, 1514, when, a, series, of, dangerous, snowstorms, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, various, crops, and, property, across, mexico, during, his, government, he, applied, multiple, policies, that, centered, the, government, of, the, empire, on, his, person, though, it, is, difficult, to, tell, exactly, to, which, extent, those, policies, were, applied, as, the, records, written, about, such, policies, tend, to, be, affected, by, propaganda, in, favor, of, or, against, his, person, according, to, alva, ixtlilx, chitl, among, moctezuma, s, policies, were, the, replacement, of, a, large, portion, of, his, court, including, most, of, his, advisors, with, people, he, deemed, preferable, and, increasing, the, division, between, the, commoner, and, noble, classes, which, included, the, refusal, to, offer, certain, honors, to, various, politicians, and, warriors, for, being, commoners, he, also, prohibited, any, commoners, or, illegitimate, children, of, the, nobility, from, serving, in, his, palace, or, high, positions, of, government, this, was, contrary, to, the, policies, of, his, predecessors, who, did, allow, commoners, to, serve, in, such, positions, moctezuma, s, elitism, can, be, attributed, to, a, long, conflict, of, interests, between, the, nobility, merchants, and, warrior, class, the, struggle, occurred, as, the, result, of, the, conflicting, interests, between, the, merchants, and, the, nobility, and, the, rivalry, between, the, warrior, class, and, the, nobility, for, positions, of, power, in, the, government, moctezuma, likely, sought, to, resolve, this, conflict, by, installing, despotist, policies, that, would, settle, it, however, it, is, also, true, that, many, of, his, elitist, policies, were, put, in, place, because, he, did, not, want, to, work, with, inferior, people, and, instead, wanted, to, be, served, by, and, interact, with, people, he, deemed, more, prestigious, both, to, avoid, giving, himself, and, the, government, a, bad, reputation, and, to, work, with, people, he, trusted, better, however, some, of, his, policies, also, affected, the, nobility, as, he, had, intentions, of, reforming, it, so, that, it, would, not, pose, a, potential, threat, to, the, government, among, these, policies, was, the, obligation, of, the, nobility, to, reside, permanently, in, tenochtitlan, and, abandon, their, homes, if, they, lived, elsewhere, regarding, his, economic, policies, moctezuma, s, rule, was, largely, affected, by, natural, disasters, in, the, early, years, as, mentioned, before, the, famine, during, his, first, years, as, tlatoani, resulted, in, a, temporary, increase, in, tribute, in, some, provinces, to, aid, the, population, some, provinces, however, ended, up, paying, more, tribute, permanently, most, likely, as, the, result, of, his, primary, military, focus, shifting, from, territorial, expansion, to, stabilization, of, the, empire, through, the, suppression, of, rebellions, most, of, the, provinces, affected, by, these, new, tributary, policies, were, in, the, valley, of, mexico, for, example, the, province, of, amaquemecan, which, formed, part, of, the, chalco, region, was, assigned, to, pay, an, additional, tribute, of, stone, and, wood, twice, or, thrice, a, year, for, tenochtitlan, s, building, projects, this, tributary, policy, eventually, backfired, as, some, of, the, empire, s, subjects, grew, disgruntled, with, moctezuma, s, government, and, launched, rebellions, against, him, which, eventually, resulted, in, many, of, these, provinces, including, totonacapan, under, the, de, facto, leadership, of, chicomacatl, chalco, and, mixquic, which, were, near, tenochtitlan, forming, alliances, with, spain, against, him, the, famine, at, the, beginning, of, his, rule, also, resulted, in, the, abolishment, of, the, huehuetlatlacolli, system, which, was, a, system, of, serfdom, in, which, a, family, agreed, to, maintain, a, tlacohtli, slave, or, serf, perpetually, this, agreement, also, turned, the, descendants, of, the, ones, who, agreed, into, serfs, during, his, campaign, against, jaltepec, and, cuatzontlan, see, below, he, made, negotiations, with, the, tlatelolca, to, obtain, the, weapons, and, resources, needed, as, a, result, of, these, negotiations, tlatelolco, was, given, more, sovereignty, they, were, permitted, to, rebuild, their, main, temple, which, was, partially, destroyed, in, the, battle, of, tlatelolco, in, a, civil, war, during, axay, catl, s, reign, act, largely, independently, during, military, campaigns, and, be, absolved, from, paying, tribute, many, of, these, policies, were, planned, together, with, his, uncle, tlilpotonqui, cihuacoatl, of, mexico, and, son, of, tlacaelel, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, while, others, such, as, his, tributary, policies, were, created, as, the, result, of, various, events, like, the, famine, which, occurred, at, the, beginning, of, his, rule, his, policies, in, general, had, the, purpose, of, centralizing, the, government, in, his, person, through, the, means, of, implementing, policies, to, settle, the, divide, between, the, nobility, and, commoners, and, abolishing, some, of, the, more, feudal, policies, of, his, predecessors, while, also, making, his, tributary, policies, more, severe, to, aid, the, population, during, natural, disasters, and, to, compensate, for, a, less, expansionist, focus, in, his, military, campaigns, most, of, the, policies, implemented, during, his, rule, would, not, last, long, after, his, death, as, the, empire, fell, into, spanish, control, on, 13, august, 1521, as, a, result, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, one, year, after, he, died, the, new, spanish, authorities, implemented, their, laws, and, removed, many, of, the, political, establishments, founded, during, the, pre, hispanic, era, leaving, just, a, few, in, place, among, the, few, policies, that, lasted, was, the, divide, between, the, nobility, and, the, commoners, as, members, of, the, pre, hispanic, nobility, continued, to, enjoy, various, privileges, under, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, such, as, land, ownership, through, a, system, known, as, cacicazgo, moctezuma, like, many, of, his, predecessors, built, a, tecpan, palace, of, his, own, this, was, a, particularly, large, palace, which, was, somewhat, larger, than, the, national, palace, that, exists, today, which, was, built, over, it, being, about, 200, meters, long, and, 200, meters, wide, however, little, archaeological, evidence, exists, to, understand, what, his, palace, looked, like, but, the, various, descriptions, of, it, and, the, space, it, covered, have, helped, reconstruct, various, features, of, its, layout, even, so, these, descriptions, tend, to, be, limited, as, many, writers, were, unable, to, describe, them, in, detail, the, spanish, captain, hern, n, cort, s, the, main, commander, of, the, spanish, troops, that, entered, mexico, in, the, year, 1519, himself, stated, in, his, letters, to, the, king, of, spain, that, he, would, not, bother, describing, it, claiming, that, it, was, so, marvelous, that, it, seems, to, me, impossible, to, describe, its, excellence, the, palace, had, a, large, courtyard, that, opened, into, the, central, plaza, of, the, city, to, the, north, where, templo, mayor, was, this, courtyard, was, a, place, where, hundreds, of, courtiers, would, hold, multiple, sorts, of, activities, including, feasts, and, waiting, for, royal, business, to, be, conducted, this, courtyard, had, suites, of, rooms, that, surrounded, smaller, courtyards, and, gardens, his, residence, had, many, rooms, for, various, purposes, aside, from, his, room, at, the, central, part, of, the, upper, floor, there, were, two, rooms, beside, it, which, were, known, as, coacalli, guest, house, one, of, these, rooms, was, built, for, the, lords, of, tlacopan, and, texcoco, the, other, two, members, of, the, triple, alliance, who, came, to, visit, the, other, room, was, for, the, lords, of, colhuacan, tenayohcan, today, known, as, tenayuca, and, chicuhnautlan, today, santa, mar, a, chiconautla, the, exact, reason, why, this, room, had, this, purpose, remains, uncertain, though, a, few, records, like, codex, mendoza, say, the, reason, was, that, these, lords, were, personal, friends, of, moctezuma, there, was, also, another, room, which, became, known, as, casa, denegrida, de, moctezuma, spanish, moctezuma, s, black, house, a, room, with, no, windows, and, fully, painted, black, which, was, used, by, moctezuma, to, meditate, remains, of, this, room, have, been, found, in, recent, years, in, modern, mexico, city, the, upper, floor, had, a, large, courtyard, which, was, likely, used, as, a, cuicacalli, for, public, shows, during, religious, rituals, the, bottom, floor, had, two, rooms, which, were, used, by, the, government, one, of, them, was, used, for, moctezuma, s, advisors, and, judges, who, dealt, with, the, situations, of, the, commoners, likely, the, tlacxitlan, the, other, room, was, for, the, war, council, likely, the, tequihuacalli, where, high, ranking, warriors, planned, and, commanded, their, battles, as, part, of, the, construction, of, moctezuma, s, palace, various, projects, were, made, which, made, it, more, prestigious, by, providing, entertainment, to, the, public, one, of, the, most, famous, among, these, projects, was, the, totocalli, house, of, birds, a, zoo, which, had, multiple, sorts, of, animals, mainly, avian, species, but, also, contained, several, predatory, animals, in, their, section, these, animals, were, taken, care, of, by, servants, who, cleaned, their, environments, fed, them, and, offered, them, care, according, to, their, species, the, species, of, birds, held, within, the, zoo, were, widely, varied, holding, animals, like, quetzals, eagles, true, parrots, and, others, and, also, included, water, species, like, roseate, spoonbills, and, various, others, that, had, their, pond, the, section, with, animals, other, than, birds, which, was, decorated, with, figures, of, gods, associated, with, the, wild, was, also, considerably, varied, having, jaguars, wolves, snakes, and, other, smaller, predatory, animals, these, animals, were, fed, on, hunted, animals, like, deer, turkeys, and, other, smaller, animals, allegedly, the, dead, bodies, of, sacrificial, victims, were, also, used, to, feed, these, animals, and, after, the, battle, known, as, la, noche, triste, which, occurred, during, the, early, stages, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, in, june, 1520, during, which, moctezuma, died, the, bodies, of, dead, spaniards, may, have, been, used, to, feed, them, this, place, was, highly, prestigious, and, all, sorts, of, important, people, are, said, to, have, used, to, visit, this, place, including, artists, craftsmen, government, officials, and, blacksmiths, the, totocalli, however, was, burnt, and, destroyed, along, with, many, other, constructions, in, the, year, 1521, during, the, siege, of, tenochtitlan, as, the, spanish, captain, hern, n, cort, s, ordered, for, many, of, the, buildings, that, formed, part, of, the, royal, palaces, to, be, burnt, to, demoralize, the, mexica, army, and, civilians, though, cort, s, himself, admitted, that, he, enjoyed, the, zoo, he, stated, that, he, saw, it, as, a, necessary, measure, in, his, third, letter, to, king, charles, i, of, spain, another, construction, was, the, chapultepec, aqueduct, built, in, 1506, to, bring, fresh, water, directly, from, chapultepec, to, tenochtitlan, and, tlatelolco, this, water, was, driven, to, the, merchant, ports, of, the, city, for, people, to, drink, and, to, the, temples, this, aqueduct, was, destroyed, less, than, a, year, after, moctezuma, s, death, during, the, siege, of, tenochtitlan, in, 1521, as, the, spaniards, decided, to, destroy, it, to, cut, tenochtitlan, s, water, supply, some, mexica, warriors, attempted, to, resist, its, destruction, but, were, repelled, by, the, tlaxcalan, allies, of, the, spanish, at, the, beginning, of, his, rule, he, attempted, to, build, diplomatic, ties, with, tlaxcala, huexotzinco, today, huejotzingo, chollolan, cholula, michoacan, and, metztitl, n, by, secretly, inviting, the, lords, of, these, countries, to, attend, the, celebrations, for, his, coronation, before, the, continuation, of, the, flower, wars, which, were, wars, of, religious, nature, arranged, voluntarily, by, the, parties, involved, with, no, territorial, purposes, but, instead, to, capture, and, sacrifice, as, many, soldiers, as, possible, during, this, period, mexico, and, tlaxcala, still, were, not, at, war, but, the, tension, between, these, nations, was, high, and, the, embassy, sent, for, this, purpose, was, put, in, a, highly, risky, situation, for, which, reason, moctezuma, chose, as, members, of, the, embassy, only, experts, in, diplomacy, espionage, and, languages, fortunately, his, invitation, was, accepted, and, moctezuma, used, this, opportunity, to, show, his, greatness, to, the, lords, who, attended, however, because, the, invitation, was, secret, to, avoid, a, scandal, for, inviting, his, rivals, to, this, ceremony, moctezuma, ordered, that, no, one, should, know, that, the, lords, were, present, not, even, the, rulers, of, tlacopan, today, known, as, tacuba, and, texcoco, and, the, lords, saw, themselves, often, forced, to, pretend, to, be, organizers, to, avoid, confusion, though, moctezuma, would, continue, to, hold, meetings, with, these, people, where, various, religious, rituals, were, held, it, did, not, take, long, for, large, scale, conflicts, to, erupt, between, these, nations, an, important, thing, to, note, is, that, contrary, to, popular, belief, tlaxcala, was, not, mexico, s, most, powerful, rival, in, the, central, mexican, region, in, this, period, and, it, would, not, be, so, until, the, final, years, of, pre, hispanic, mexico, in, 1518, 19, in, the, opening, years, of, the, 16th, century, huejotzingo, was, mexico, s, actual, military, focus, and, it, proved, itself, to, be, one, of, the, most, powerful, political, entities, until, these, final, years, as, a, series, of, devastating, wars, weakened, the, state, into, being, conquered, by, tlaxcala, during, his, reign, he, married, the, queen, of, ecatepec, tlapalizquixochtzin, making, him, king, consort, of, this, altepetl, though, according, to, the, chronicle, written, by, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, very, few, people, in, mexico, knew, about, this, political, role, being, only, a, few, among, his, closest, courtiers, among, those, who, knew, the, first, military, campaign, during, his, rule, which, was, done, in, honor, of, his, coronation, was, the, violent, suppression, of, a, rebellion, in, nopala, and, icpatepec, for, this, war, a, force, of, over, 60, 000, soldiers, from, tenochtitlan, texcoco, tepanec, lands, chalco, and, xochimilco, participated, and, moctezuma, himself, went, to, the, frontlines, approximately, 5100, prisoners, were, taken, after, the, campaign, many, of, whom, were, given, to, inhabitants, of, tenochtitlan, and, chalco, as, slaves, while, the, rest, were, sacrificed, in, his, honor, on, the, fourth, day, of, his, coronation, in, nopala, mexica, soldiers, committed, a, massacre, and, burned, down, the, temples, and, houses, going, against, moctezuma, s, wishes, after, the, campaign, celebrations, for, his, coronation, continued, in, tenochtitlan, moctezuma, s, territorial, expansion, however, would, not, truly, begin, until, another, rebellion, was, suppressed, in, tlachquiauhco, today, known, as, tlaxiaco, where, its, ruler, malinalli, was, killed, after, trying, to, start, the, rebellion, in, this, campaign, all, adults, above, the, age, of, 50, within, the, city, were, killed, under, moctezuma, s, orders, as, he, blamed, them, for, the, rebellion, a, characteristic, fact, about, moctezuma, s, wars, was, that, a, large, portion, of, them, had, the, purpose, of, suppressing, rebellions, rather, than, conquering, new, territory, contrary, to, his, predecessors, whose, main, focus, was, territorial, expansion, during, his, reign, multiple, rebellions, were, suppressed, by, the, use, of, force, and, often, ended, with, violent, results, as, mentioned, previously, the, first, campaign, during, his, reign, which, was, done, in, honor, of, his, coronation, was, the, suppression, of, a, rebellion, in, nopallan, today, known, as, santos, reyes, nopala, and, icpatepec, a, mixtec, town, that, no, longer, exists, which, was, near, silacayoapam, both, in, modern, day, oaxaca, the, prisoners, taken, during, this, campaign, were, later, used, as, slaves, or, for, human, sacrifice, after, mexico, suffered, a, humiliating, defeat, at, atlixco, during, a, flower, war, against, huejotzingo, see, below, many, sites, in, oaxaca, rebelled, likely, under, the, idea, that, the, empire, s, forces, were, weakened, however, moctezuma, was, able, to, raise, an, army, numbering, 200, 000, and, marched, over, the, city, of, yancuitlan, today, known, as, yanhuitlan, a, city, which, had, been, previously, conquered, by, tizoc, and, conquered, zozollan, in, the, process, abundant, territorial, expansion, was, carried, out, following, this, another, notable, rebellion, occurred, in, atlixco, in, modern, day, puebla, a, city, neighboring, tlaxcala, which, had, previously, been, conquered, by, ahuizotl, this, rebellion, occurred, in, 1508, and, was, repressed, by, a, prince, named, macuilmalinatzin, this, wasn, t, the, first, conflict, that, occurred, in, this, region, as, its, proximity, with, tlaxcala, and, huejotzingo, would, cause, multiple, conflicts, to, erupt, in, this, area, during, moctezuma, s, reign, a, large, series, of, rebellions, occurred, in, 1510, likely, as, a, result, of, astrological, predictions, halting, some, mexica, military, operations, to, a, degree, moctezuma, would, try, to, campaign, against, these, rebellions, one, at, a, time, throughout, the, following, years, campaigning, against, territories, in, oaxaca, including, icpatepec, again, in, 1511, or, 1512, some, of, these, revolts, occurred, as, far, south, as, xoconochco, today, known, as, soconusco, and, huiztlan, today, huixtla, far, down, where, the, mexican, guatemalan, border, is, today, these, territories, were, highly, important, to, the, empire, and, had, been, previously, conquered, by, his, predecessor, ahuizotl, thus, moctezuma, had, to, maintain, them, under, his, control, these, revolts, occurred, in, so, many, locations, that, the, empire, was, unable, to, deal, with, all, of, them, effectively, the, empire, s, expansion, during, moctezuma, s, rule, was, mainly, focused, on, southwestern, mesoamerican, territories, in, oaxaca, and, modern, day, guerrero, the, earliest, conquests, in, this, territory, were, held, by, moctezuma, i, the, first, important, conquest, during, moctezuma, s, rule, occurred, in, the, year, 1504, when, the, city, of, achiotlan, today, known, as, san, juan, achiutla, was, conquered, this, war, according, to, some, sources, was, supposedly, mainly, caused, by, a, small, tree, which, belonged, to, a, lord, of, the, place, which, grew, such, beautiful, flowers, moctezuma, s, envy, couldn, t, resist, it, and, when, moctezuma, asked, for, it, the, lord, of, the, city, refused, to, offer, it, thus, starting, the, war, after, the, conquest, this, tree, was, supposedly, taken, to, tenochtitlan, the, second, conquest, occurred, in, zozollan, a, place, neighboring, east, of, achiutla, on, 28, may, 1506, during, the, campaign, against, the, yanhuitlan, rebellion, this, conquest, had, a, particularly, violent, result, as, a, special, sacrifice, was, held, after, the, campaign, where, the, prisoners, captured, in, zozollan, were, the, victims, the, mexicans, killed, many, of, the, people, from, zozola, which, they, captured, in, war, according, to, old, sources, in, the, year, 1507, the, year, of, the, new, fire, ceremony, abundant, military, action, occurred, among, the, towns, that, are, listed, to, have, been, conquered, this, year, are, tecuhtepec, from, which, multiple, prisoners, were, sacrificed, for, the, ceremony, iztitlan, nocheztlan, an, important, town, northeast, of, achiutla, quetzaltepec, and, tototepec, the, conquest, of, tototepec, formed, part, of, the, conquests, of, some, of, the, last, few, tlapanec, territories, of, modern, day, guerrero, an, area, which, had, already, been, in, decline, since, moctezuma, i, began, his, first, campaigns, in, the, region, and, probably, turned, the, kingdom, of, tlachinollan, modern, day, tlapa, into, a, tributary, province, during, the, rule, of, lord, tlaloc, between, 1461, and, 1467, though, the, kingdom, would, not, be, invaded, and, fully, conquered, until, the, reign, of, ahuizotl, in, 1486, along, with, caltitlan, a, city, neighboring, west, of, tlapa, in, between, the, years, of, 1503, and, 1509, a, campaign, was, launched, against, xipetepec, and, another, was, launched, as, mentioned, previously, in, 1507, against, tototepec, which, had, previously, been, a, territory, conquered, by, tlachinollan, in, the, mid, 14th, century, the, campaign, in, tototepec, occurred, as, the, result, of, a, large, group, of, mexica, merchants, sent, by, moctezuma, being, killed, after, they, attempted, to, trade, for, some, of, the, resources, of, the, area, on, his, behalf, during, the, conquest, of, tototepec, two, important, mexica, noblemen, ixtlilcuechahuac, and, huitzilihuitzin, not, to, be, confused, with, the, tlatoani, of, this, name, were, killed, all, the, population, of, tototepec, except, for, the, children, was, massacred, by, the, mexica, forces, and, about, 1350, captives, were, taken, another, campaign, was, launched, in, 1515, to, conquer, acocozpan, and, tetenanco, and, reconquer, atlitepec, which, had, been, previously, conquered, by, ahuizotl, in, 1493, quetzaltepec, was, conquered, on, the, same, campaign, as, tototepec, as, both, reportedly, murdered, the, merchants, sent, by, moctezuma, in, the, area, the, mexica, managed, to, raise, an, army, of, 400, 000, and, first, conquered, tototepec, quetzaltepec, was, also, conquered, but, it, rebelled, along, with, various, sites, across, oaxaca, soon, after, when, the, mexica, lost, the, battle, of, atlixco, against, huejotzingo, being, a, fortified, city, with, six, walls, the, mexica, put, the, city, under, siege, for, several, days, with, the, each, of, groups, of, the, triple, alliance, attacking, from, various, locations, and, having, over, 200, wooden, ladders, constructed, under, moctezuma, s, orders, the, mexica, eventually, emerged, victorious, successfully, conquering, the, city, several, military, defeats, occurred, in, some, of, these, expansionist, campaigns, however, such, as, the, invasion, of, amatlan, in, 1509, where, an, unexpected, series, of, snowstorms, and, blizzards, killed, many, soldiers, making, the, surviving, ones, too, low, in, numbers, to, fight, an, important, campaign, was, the, conquest, of, xaltepec, today, known, as, jaltepec, and, cuatzontlan, and, the, suppression, of, the, last, revolt, in, icpatepec, all, in, oaxaca, this, war, started, as, the, result, of, provocations, given, by, jaltepec, against, moctezuma, through, killing, as, many, mexicas, as, they, could, find, in, their, area, as, some, sort, of, way, to, challenge, him, and, the, beginning, of, the, revolt, by, icpatepec, as, the, result, the, xaltepeca, had, done, this, before, with, previous, tlatoanis, and, other, nations, moctezuma, and, the, recently, elected, ruler, of, tlacopan, themselves, went, to, the, fight, along, with, tlacaelel, s, grandson, and, cihuacoatl, of, mexico, in, this, period, tlacaeleltzin, xocoyotl, a, large, portion, of, the, weapons, and, food, was, brought, by, tlatelolco, though, they, were, initially, hesitant, to, do, so, but, were, ordered, by, moctezuma, to, offer, it, as, a, tribute, to, tenochtitlan, and, they, received, multiple, rewards, as, the, result, including, the, permission, to, rebuild, their, main, temple, which, had, been, partially, destroyed, during, the, battle, of, tlatelolco, which, occurred, during, axayacatl, s, reign, this, campaign, had, a, highly, violent, result, moctezuma, after, receiving, information, on, the, cities, gathered, by, his, spies, ordered, for, all, adults, in, the, sites, above, the, age, of, 50, to, be, killed, to, prevent, a, rebellion, once, the, cities, were, conquered, similar, to, the, war, in, tlachquiauhco, the, conquest, was, done, by, dividing, the, army, that, was, brought, in, 3, divisions, one, from, tlacopan, one, from, texcoco, and, one, from, tenochtitlan, so, that, each, one, attacked, a, different, city, the, tenochtitlan, company, attacked, jaltepec, moctezuma, came, out, victorious, and, then, returned, to, mexico, through, chalco, where, he, received, many, honors, for, his, victory, this, war, likely, happened, in, 1511, as, a, war, against, icpatepec, is, recorded, to, have, happened, again, in, that, year, after, the, campaigns, in, the, oaxaca, region, moctezuma, began, to, move, his, campaigns, into, northern, and, eastern, territories, around, 1514, conquering, the, site, of, quetzalapan, a, chichimec, territory, through, the, huastec, region, taking, 1332, captives, and, suffering, minimal, casualties, with, only, 95, reported, losses, likely, around, this, time, many, other, territories, in, the, region, were, also, conquered, he, also, went, to, war, against, the, tarascan, empire, for, the, first, time, since, axay, catl, was, defeated, in, his, disastrous, invasion, this, war, caused, high, casualties, on, both, sides, the, mexica, succeeded, at, taking, a, large, amount, of, captives, but, failed, to, conquer, any, territory, among, the, final, military, campaigns, carried, out, by, moctezuma, aside, from, the, late, stages, of, the, war, against, tlaxcala, were, the, conquests, of, mazatzintlan, and, zacatepec, which, formed, part, of, the, chichimec, region, the, approximate, number, of, military, engagements, during, his, rule, before, european, contact, was, 73, achieving, victory, in, approximately, 43, sites, including, territories, already, within, the, empire, making, him, one, of, the, most, active, monarchs, in, pre, hispanic, mexican, history, in, terms, of, military, actions, however, his, rule, and, policies, suffered, a, very, sudden, interruption, upon, the, news, of, the, arrival, of, spanish, ships, in, the, east, in, 1519, see, below, one, of, the, most, controversial, events, during, his, reign, was, the, supposed, overthrow, of, the, legitimate, government, of, nezahualpilli, in, texcoco, historians, such, as, alva, ixtlilx, chitl, even, went, as, far, as, referring, to, this, action, as, diabolical, while, also, making, claims, that, are, not, seen, in, other, chronicles, and, are, generally, not, trusted, by, modern, historians, the, circumstances, of, nezahualpilli, s, death, are, not, clear, and, many, sources, offer, highly, conflicting, stories, about, the, events, that, resulted, in, it, according, to, alva, ixtlilx, chitl, the, issue, began, when, moctezuma, sent, an, embassy, to, nezahualpilli, reprimanding, him, for, not, sacrificing, any, tlaxcalan, prisoners, since, the, last, 4, years, during, the, war, with, tlaxcala, see, below, threatening, him, saying, that, he, was, angering, the, gods, nezahualpilli, replied, to, this, embassy, stating, that, the, reason, he, had, not, sacrificed, them, was, that, he, simply, did, not, want, to, wage, war, because, he, and, his, population, wanted, to, live, peacefully, for, the, time, being, as, the, ceremonies, that, would, be, held, in, the, following, year, 1, reed, would, make, war, inevitable, and, that, soon, his, wishes, would, be, granted, eventually, nezahualpilli, launched, a, campaign, against, tlaxcala, though, he, did, not, go, himself, instead, sending, two, of, his, sons, acatlemacoctzin, and, tecuanehuatzin, as, commanders, moctezuma, then, decided, to, betray, nezahualpilli, by, sending, a, secret, embassy, to, tlaxcala, telling, them, about, the, incoming, army, the, tlaxcalans, then, began, to, take, action, against, the, texcoca, while, they, were, unaware, of, this, betrayal, the, texcoco, armies, were, ambushed, in, the, middle, of, the, night, almost, none, of, the, texcoca, survived, the, fight, upon, receiving, the, news, of, moctezuma, s, betrayal, understanding, that, nothing, could, be, done, about, it, and, fearing, for, the, future, of, his, people, nezahualpilli, committed, suicide, in, his, palace, this, story, however, as, mentioned, before, is, not, generally, trusted, by, modern, historians, and, much, of, the, information, given, contradicts, other, sources, sources, do, agree, however, that, nezahualpilli, s, last, years, as, ruler, were, mainly, characterized, by, his, attempts, to, live, a, peaceful, life, likely, as, the, result, of, his, old, age, he, spent, his, last, months, mostly, inactive, in, his, rule, and, his, advisors, on, his, request, took, most, of, the, government, s, decisions, during, this, period, he, assigned, two, men, of, whom, details, are, mostly, unknown, to, take, control, of, almost, all, government, decisions, these, sources, also, agree, that, he, was, found, dead, in, his, palace, but, the, cause, of, his, death, remains, uncertain, his, death, is, recorded, to, have, been, mourned, in, texcoco, tenochtitlan, tlacopan, and, even, chalco, and, xochimilco, as, all, of, these, altepeme, gave, precious, offerings, like, jewelry, and, clothes, and, sacrifices, in, his, honor, moctezuma, himself, was, reported, to, have, broken, into, tears, upon, receiving, the, news, of, his, death, his, death, was, mourned, for, 80, days, this, was, recorded, as, one, of, the, largest, funeral, ceremonies, in, pre, hispanic, mexican, history, since, nezahualipilli, died, abruptly, in, the, year, 1516, he, left, no, indication, as, to, who, his, successor, would, be, he, had, six, legitimate, sons, cacamatzin, coanacochtli, later, baptized, as, don, pedro, tecocoltzin, baptized, as, don, hernando, ixtlilxochitl, ii, baptized, as, don, hernando, yoyontzin, baptized, as, don, jorge, and, tetlahuehuetzquititzin, baptized, as, don, pedro, all, of, whom, would, eventually, take, the, throne, though, most, of, them, after, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, his, most, likely, heir, was, tetlahuehuetzquititzin, as, he, was, the, wealthiest, among, nezahualpilli, s, sons, but, he, was, considered, inept, for, the, job, his, other, most, likely, heirs, were, ixtlilxochitl, coanacochtli, and, cacamatzin, though, not, everyone, supported, them, as, they, were, considerably, younger, than, tetlahuehuetzquititzin, as, ixtlilxochitl, was, 19, years, old, and, cacamatzin, was, about, 21, moctezuma, supported, cacamatzin, since, he, was, his, nephew, in, the, end, the, texcoco, council, voted, in, favor, of, moctezuma, s, decision, and, cacamatzin, was, declared, tlatoani, being, that, he, was, the, son, of, moctezuma, s, sister, xocotzin, and, was, older, than, his, two, other, brothers, though, coanacochtli, felt, the, decision, was, fair, ixtlilxochitl, disagreed, with, the, results, and, protested, against, the, council, ixtlilxochitl, argued, that, the, reason, why, moctezuma, supported, cacamatzin, was, because, he, wanted, to, manipulate, him, so, that, he, could, take, over, texcoco, being, that, he, was, his, uncle, coanacochtli, responded, that, the, decision, was, legitimate, and, that, even, if, cacamatzin, was, not, elected, ixtlilxochitl, would, not, have, been, elected, either, as, he, was, younger, than, the, two, cacamatzin, stayed, quiet, during, the, whole, debate, eventually, the, members, of, the, council, shut, down, the, debate, to, prevent, a, violent, escalation, though, cacamatzin, was, officially, declared, tlatoani, the, coronation, ceremony, didn, t, occur, that, day, and, ixtlilxochitl, used, this, as, an, opportunity, to, plan, his, rebellion, against, him, shortly, after, the, election, ixtlilxochitl, began, to, prepare, his, revolt, by, going, to, metztitl, n, to, raise, an, army, threatening, civil, war, cacamatzin, went, to, tenochtitlan, to, ask, moctezuma, for, help, moctezuma, understanding, ixtlilxochitl, s, war, like, nature, decided, to, support, cacamatzin, with, his, military, forces, should, a, conflict, begin, and, try, to, talk, ixtlilxochitl, into, stopping, the, conflict, and, also, suggested, taking, nezahualpilli, s, treasure, to, tenochtitlan, to, prevent, a, sacking, according, to, alva, ixtlilx, chitl, cacamatzin, asked, moctezuma, for, help, after, ixtlilxochitl, went, to, metztitl, n, while, other, sources, claim, that, ixtlilxochitl, went, to, metztitl, n, because, of, cacamatzin, s, visit, to, moctezuma, ixtlilxochitl, first, went, to, tulancingo, with, 100, 000, men, where, he, was, received, with, many, honors, and, recognized, as, the, real, king, of, texcoco, he, then, accelerated, his, pace, possibly, because, he, received, worrying, news, from, texcoco, and, advanced, to, the, city, of, tepeapulco, where, he, was, also, welcomed, he, soon, advanced, to, otompan, today, known, as, otumba, state, of, mexico, where, he, sent, a, message, before, his, entrance, in, hopes, of, being, received, as, a, king, there, as, well, however, the, people, of, otumba, supported, cacamatzin, and, informed, ixtlilxochitl, that, such, a, demand, would, not, be, fulfilled, ixtlilxochitl, therefore, sent, his, troops, to, invade, the, city, and, after, a, long, fight, the, troops, began, to, gradually, retreat, and, its, ruler, was, killed, when, the, news, of, this, fight, was, heard, in, texcoco, all, events, religious, or, not, were, canceled, soldiers, were, recruited, troops, were, sent, from, tenochtitlan, to, the, city, and, cacamatzin, and, coanacochtli, fortified, the, city, to, avoid, an, invasion, he, eventually, reached, texcoco, and, placed, the, city, under, siege, while, also, occupying, the, cities, of, papalotlan, acolman, chicuhnautlan, today, known, as, santa, mar, a, chiconautla, tecacman, tzonpanco, zumpango, and, huehuetocan, to, take, every, possible, entrance, moctezuma, could, use, to, send, his, troops, to, texcoco, moctezuma, however, used, his, influence, to, enter, the, city, of, texcoco, and, obtain, access, to, the, acolhua, cities, not, yet, occupied, by, ixtlilxochitl, cacamatzin, used, this, opportunity, to, send, a, commander, from, iztapalapa, named, xochitl, to, arrest, ixtlilxochitl, as, peacefully, as, possible, moctezuma, approved, this, decision, and, xochitl, was, sent, along, with, some, troops, ixtlilxochitl, was, quickly, informed, about, this, and, as, per, the, custom, of, war, informed, xochitl, that, he, was, going, to, fight, him, a, short, battle, occurred, some, time, after, in, which, xochitl, was, captured, and, later, publicly, executed, by, burning, once, the, news, of, this, defeat, was, heard, by, moctezuma, he, ordered, that, no, more, military, engagements, be, done, for, the, moment, to, prevent, further, escalation, and, that, he, wanted, to, rightfully, punish, ixtlilxochitl, for, what, he, did, at, a, more, appropriate, moment, in, the, meantime, the, brothers, agreed, to, try, to, reach, a, consensus, through, a, peaceful, debate, as, ixtlilxochitl, did, not, want, to, fight, either, as, he, claimed, that, he, only, sent, the, troops, as, a, means, of, protest, and, not, to, wage, war, however, this, would, only, be, done, under, the, condition, that, moctezuma, would, not, get, involved, by, any, means, the, three, brothers, then, agreed, to, divide, the, province, of, acolhuacan, where, texcoco, was, the, de, facto, capital, in, three, parts, one, for, each, brother, and, that, cacamatzin, would, continue, to, rule, over, texcoco, at, some, point, however, ixtlilxochitl, sought, refuge, outside, of, texcoco, to, avoid, facing, a, conflict, with, cacamatzin, this, crisis, would, later, become, relevant, again, after, the, spanish, arrived, at, tenochtitlan, when, cacamatzin, who, initially, welcomed, the, spaniards, when, they, first, entered, in, november, 1519, attempted, to, raise, an, army, against, them, for, imprisoning, moctezuma, see, below, by, calling, for, the, people, of, coyoacan, tlacopan, iztapalapa, and, the, matlatzinca, people, to, enter, the, city, kill, the, spaniards, and, free, moctezuma, in, early, 1520, the, spanish, captain, hern, n, cort, s, who, was, the, main, commander, of, the, spanish, troops, who, entered, mexico, decided, to, act, and, ordered, moctezuma, to, send, someone, to, arrest, cacamatzin, before, the, attack, moctezuma, suggested, that, ixtlilxochitl, be, sent, due, to, the, crisis, as, then, he, could, take, the, throne, and, prevent, another, succession, crisis, he, still, tried, to, establish, negotiations, between, the, texcoco, leadership, and, the, spaniards, but, was, unable, to, change, cacamatzin, s, mind, eventually, moctezuma, sent, troops, to, secretly, arrest, cacamatzin, in, his, palace, and, send, him, to, mexico, after, he, ordered, for, three, of, his, commanders, to, be, arrested, for, suggesting, requesting, mocetzuma, s, permission, for, the, attack, and, telling, him, that, there, was, no, chance, of, entering, into, negotiations, with, the, spaniards, ixtlilxochitl, became, the, likely, de, facto, leader, of, texcoco, afterwards, though, according, to, bernardino, de, sahag, n, it, was, tecocoltzin, who, officially, took, the, title, of, tlatoani, after, cacamatzin, s, arrest, and, ixtlilxochitl, would, not, officially, become, the, tlatoani, until, a, year, later, ixtlilxochitl, continued, fighting, for, the, spaniards, afterwards, became, a, personal, friend, of, cort, s, converted, to, christianity, and, participated, in, the, spanish, conquest, of, honduras, in, 1525, his, figure, has, remained, controversial, in, the, historical, record, as, some, have, seen, him, as, a, man, who, betrayed, his, people, for, his, ambition, while, others, have, seen, him, as, a, brave, warrior, who, fought, against, the, tyrannical, rule, of, moctezuma, ii, and, liberated, the, peoples, he, subjugated, with, the, help, of, hern, n, cort, s, though, the, first, conflicts, between, mexico, and, tlaxcala, huejotzingo, and, their, allies, began, during, the, rule, of, moctezuma, i, in, the, 1450s, it, was, during, the, reign, of, moctezuma, ii, that, major, conflicts, broke, through, huejotzingo, pyrrhic, victory, approximately, in, the, year, 1503, or, 1507, after, the, conquest, of, tototepec, according, to, historian, diego, dur, n, a, massive, battle, occurred, in, atlixco, which, was, fought, mainly, against, huejotzingo, a, kingdom, that, used, to, be, one, of, the, most, powerful, ones, in, the, valley, of, mexico, the, war, was, provoked, by, moctezuma, himself, who, wanted, to, go, to, war, against, huejotzingo, because, it, had, been, many, months, since, the, last, war, the, local, rulers, of, the, region, accepted, moctezuma, s, proposal, to, wage, this, war, it, was, declared, as, a, flower, war, and, the, invitation, to, go, to, war, was, accepted, by, the, people, of, huejotzingo, tlaxcala, cholula, and, tliliuhquitepec, a, city, state, nearby, the, war, was, arranged, to, occur, in, the, plains, of, atlixco, moctezuma, went, to, the, fight, along, with, four, or, five, of, his, brothers, and, two, of, his, nephews, he, named, one, of, his, brothers, or, children, according, to, some, sources, tlacahuepan, as, the, main, commander, of, the, troops, against, the, troops, of, huejotzingo, he, was, assigned, 100, 000, troops, to, fight, tlacahuepan, decided, to, begin, the, fight, by, dividing, the, troops, into, three, groups, which, would, attack, one, after, the, other, the, first, being, the, troops, from, texcoco, then, from, tlacopan, and, lastly, from, tenochtitlan, he, began, by, sending, 200, troops, to, launch, skirmishes, against, the, huexotzinca, but, despite, the, large, numbers, and, skirmishes, he, was, unable, to, break, the, enemy, lines, the, group, of, texcoco, suffered, huge, losses, and, once, they, were, unable, to, fight, they, were, put, to, rest, while, the, group, from, tlacopan, was, sent, however, they, were, still, unable, to, break, the, lines, the, tenochca, group, then, advanced, and, pushed, to, aid, the, tepanecs, of, tlacopan, causing, multiple, casualties, against, the, huexotzinca, but, the, lines, were, still, not, broken, as, more, reinforcements, arrived, eventually, tlacahuepan, saw, himself, surrounded, and, though, he, initially, resisted, he, finally, surrendered, though, the, huexotzinca, wanted, to, take, him, alive, he, asked, to, be, sacrificed, there, on, the, battlefield, and, so, he, was, killed, and, then, the, rest, of, the, mexica, troops, retreated, the, result, of, this, battle, was, considered, humiliating, for, the, empire, according, to, primary, records, about, 40, 000, people, were, killed, on, both, sides, possibly, meaning, that, about, 20, 000, died, on, each, side, some, important, mexica, noblemen, were, also, killed, during, the, engagement, including, huitzilihuitzin, not, to, be, confused, with, the, tlatoani, of, this, name, xalmich, and, cuatacihuatl, regardless, multiple, prisoners, were, taken, after, the, fight, who, were, later, sacrificed, in, moctezuma, s, honor, tlacahuepan, was, remembered, as, a, hero, despite, the, loss, and, many, songs, were, dedicated, to, him, to, be, remembered, through, poetry, in, one, song, called, ycuic, ne, ahualpilli, yc, tlamato, huexotzinco, cuextecayotl, quitlali, cuicani, tececepouhqui, the, song, of, nezahualpilli, when, he, took, captives, in, huexotzinco, the, huastec, themes, it, was, written, down, by, the, singer, tececepouhqui, he, s, referred, as, the, golden, one, the, huastec, lord, the, owner, of, the, sapota, skirt, about, the, god, xipe, totec, and, also, states, with, the, flowery, liquor, of, war, he, is, drunk, my, nobleman, the, golden, one, the, huastec, lord, about, his, huastec, heritage, using, the, stereotype, that, the, huastecs, were, drunkards, anyway, the, defeat, was, a, humiliating, one, and, moctezuma, is, said, to, have, cried, in, anguish, upon, hearing, of, the, death, of, tlacahuepan, and, the, massive, loss, of, soldiers, moctezuma, himself, welcomed, the, soldiers, who, survived, back, into, mexico, while, the, population, that, welcomed, them, mourned, the, fact, that, the, huexotzinca, also, suffered, massive, casualties, caused, their, military, power, to, be, highly, weakened, by, this, battle, and, various, others, and, so, this, could, be, seen, as, the, beginning, of, the, fall, of, huejotzingo, as, multiple, military, losses, against, tlaxcala, and, mexico, in, the, following, years, eventually, led, to, its, fall, despite, the, victory, in, the, fight, various, other, battles, occurred, in, the, following, years, between, mexico, and, huejotzingo, and, though, none, of, them, were, as, big, as, the, battle, of, atlixco, they, still, caused, significant, losses, on, both, sides, high, losses, for, mexico, and, significant, losses, for, huejotzingo, an, engagement, which, occurred, likely, in, the, year, of, 1506, this, fight, was, another, flower, war, which, was, proposed, by, cholula, with, support, from, huejotzingo, to, be, fought, in, cuauhquechollan, today, known, as, huaquechula, in, modern, day, puebla, near, atlixco, though, moctezuma, did, not, want, to, fight, as, a, result, of, the, previous, defeat, in, atlixco, he, saw, no, other, option, and, prepared, for, the, fight, in, this, fight, warriors, from, texcoco, tlacopan, chalco, xochimilco, and, modern, day, tierra, caliente, participated, this, battle, reportedly, ended, with, 8200, mexicas, killed, or, captured, however, the, mexica, are, said, to, have, dealt, a, similar, number, of, casualties, in, this, one, day, battle, the, result, of, this, battle, was, indecisive, as, some, reported, it, as, a, victory, but, it, seems, moctezuma, ii, took, it, as, a, defeat, and, was, highly, upset, about, it, to, the, point, that, he, complained, against, the, gods, fernando, alvarado, tezoz, moc, however, reports, that, 10, 000, mexicas, died, in, this, fight, and, that, the, mexica, were, so, angry, about, the, fight, that, they, called, for, reinforcements, who, committed, a, cruel, slaughter, and, captured, 800, more, enemies, he, lists, the, number, of, huexotzinco, cholula, casualties, as, 5600, killed, and, 400, captured, in, one, other, engagement, afterwards, which, resulted, in, 8200, mexicas, killed, or, captured, it, was, approximately, in, the, year, 1504, or, 1505, when, the, first, large, scale, conflicts, between, mexico, and, tlaxcala, began, in, this, period, moctezuma, thought, about, placing, the, entire, country, under, siege, understanding, that, most, of, it, was, surrounded, by, territories, belonging, to, the, empire, the, ruler, of, huejotzingo, tecayahuatzin, sympathized, with, moctezuma, despite, their, connections, with, tlaxcala, and, conflicts, in, the, past, and, through, bribes, and, propaganda, attempted, to, ally, with, cholula, and, local, otomi, populations, to, attack, tlaxcala, though, with, little, success, the, tlaxcalans, became, greatly, worried, about, this, and, began, to, grow, suspicious, of, all, allies, they, had, fearing, a, betrayal, as, huejotzingo, was, one, of, tlaxcala, s, closest, states, as, proven, by, its, support, at, the, battle, of, atlixco, moctezuma, however, had, the, disadvantage, that, many, of, his, dominions, surrounding, tlaxcala, did, not, want, to, fight, them, as, many, of, them, used, to, be, their, allies, in, the, past, even, with, all, the, promises, moctezuma, made, and, therefore, his, support, was, actually, quite, limited, one, of, the, first, battles, occurred, in, xiloxochitlan, today, known, as, san, vicente, xiloxochitla, where, multiple, atrocities, were, committed, despite, this, the, tlaxcalan, resistance, managed, to, hold, out, and, after, a, great, struggle, the, huexotzinca, armies, were, repelled, though, during, the, fight, the, ocotelolca, commander, tizatlacatzin, was, killed, many, other, smaller, battles, took, place, in, other, parts, of, the, border, though, none, of, them, were, successful, in, response, tlaxcala, launched, a, counter, invasion, against, huejotzingo, knowing, that, the, huexotzinca, had, been, severely, weakened, by, their, fights, with, the, mexica, empire, their, towns, were, sacked, repeatedly, and, the, entire, nation, was, put, essentially, under, siege, and, the, remains, of, the, nation, were, now, cornered, in, the, region, around, the, popocat, petl, the, huexotzinca, became, greatly, worried, and, knew, they, couldn, t, win, the, war, alone, therefore, a, prince, named, teayehuatl, decided, to, send, an, embassy, to, mexico, to, request, aid, against, the, tlaxcalans, according, to, historians, like, dur, n, this, embassy, was, sent, in, the, year, 1507, just, after, the, new, fire, ceremony, while, others, date, this, embassy, to, the, year, 1512, the, embassy, informed, moctezuma, about, the, tlaxcalan, counter, invasion, which, had, been, happening, for, over, a, year, by, this, point, requesting, moctezuma, to, do, something, about, the, situation, to, expel, the, tlaxcalans, from, their, land, this, was, not, the, first, time, the, huexotzinca, had, requested, aid, from, mexico, for, similar, reasons, as, the, first, time, was, actually, around, the, year, 1499, during, the, reign, of, ahuizotl, though, this, previous, request, was, denied, after, consulting, nezahualpilli, and, the, ruler, of, tlacopan, moctezuma, agreed, to, help, the, huexotzinca, despite, the, conflicts, they, had, in, the, past, and, sent, a, large, number, of, soldiers, to, help, this, nation, while, also, allowing, many, of, their, refugees, to, stay, in, tenochtitlan, and, chalco, with, the, mexica, forces, to, support, huejotzingo, the, invasion, continued, from, the, west, with, the, main, force, from, the, towns, of, cuauhquechollan, tochimilco, itzocan, today, known, as, iz, car, de, matamoros, and, a, smaller, support, force, from, a, town, named, tetellan, today, tetela, de, ocampo, and, from, a, town, named, chietla, the, advance, was, quick, but, the, tlaxcalans, used, the, territories, they, had, captured, from, huejotzingo, to, advance, safely, to, atlixco, through, the, captured, areas, with, little, population, before, the, mexica, huejotzingo, forces, spread, once, done, a, long, fight, began, between, the, two, forces, the, battle, lasted, 20, days, and, both, armies, suffered, huge, losses, as, the, tlaxcalans, had, a, famous, general, captured, and, the, mexica, lost, so, many, men, that, they, requested, emergency, reinforcements, asking, for, all, kinds, of, people, in, the, shortest, possible, time, the, tlaxcalans, claimed, victory, in, that, fight, and, the, mexica, were, fought, into, a, complete, standstill, the, following, year, huejotzingo, started, to, suffer, a, famine, as, the, result, of, a, lack, of, resources, as, the, tlaxcalans, pushed, further, into, their, territory, the, tlaxcalans, even, went, as, far, as, burning, down, the, royal, palaces, of, huejotzingo, and, stealing, as, much, food, as, they, could, approximately, in, the, year, 1516, huejotzingo, abandoned, its, alliance, with, the, empire, the, devastating, wars, that, broke, out, against, huejotzingo, caused, this, nation, which, had, been, the, most, powerful, nation, in, the, valley, of, puebla, in, the, opening, years, of, the, 16th, century, to, become, weak, enough, to, be, conquered, by, tlaxcala, this, was, the, point, at, which, tlaxcala, became, mexico, s, most, powerful, rival, in, the, central, mexican, area, the, nation, which, used, to, be, their, main, military, focus, was, now, the, subject, of, a, nation, that, would, later, bring, the, killing, blow, to, the, mexica, empire, the, war, between, mexico, and, tlaxcala, would, eventually, have, devastating, consequences, as, the, tlaxcalans, decided, an, alliance, with, spain, against, mexico, on, 23, september, 1519, after, a, few, battles, proved, that, an, alliance, with, this, nation, could, help, them, destroy, moctezuma, s, reign, in, 1518, moctezuma, received, the, first, reports, of, europeans, landing, on, the, east, coast, of, his, empire, this, was, the, expedition, of, juan, de, grijalva, who, had, landed, on, san, juan, de, ul, a, which, although, within, totonac, territory, was, under, the, auspices, of, the, aztec, empire, moctezuma, ordered, that, he, be, kept, informed, of, any, new, sightings, of, foreigners, at, the, coast, and, posted, extra, watchguards, and, watchtowers, to, accomplish, this, when, cort, s, arrived, in, 1519, moctezuma, was, immediately, informed, and, he, sent, emissaries, to, meet, the, newcomers, one, of, them, was, an, aztec, noble, named, tentlil, in, the, nahuatl, language, but, referred, to, in, the, writings, of, cort, s, and, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, as, tendile, as, the, spaniards, approached, tenochtitl, n, they, allied, with, the, tlaxcalteca, who, were, enemies, of, the, aztec, triple, alliance, and, they, helped, instigate, revolt, in, many, towns, under, aztec, dominion, moctezuma, was, aware, of, this, and, sent, gifts, to, the, spaniards, probably, to, show, his, superiority, to, the, spaniards, and, tlaxcalteca, on, 8, november, 1519, moctezuma, met, cort, s, on, the, causeway, leading, into, tenochtitl, n, and, the, two, leaders, exchanged, gifts, moctezuma, gave, cort, s, the, gift, of, an, aztec, calendar, one, disc, of, crafted, gold, and, another, of, silver, cort, s, later, melted, these, down, for, their, monetary, value, according, to, cort, s, moctezuma, immediately, volunteered, to, cede, his, entire, realm, to, charles, v, king, of, spain, though, some, indigenous, accounts, written, in, the, 1550s, partly, support, this, notion, it, is, still, unbelievable, for, several, reasons, as, aztec, rulers, spoke, an, overly, polite, language, that, needed, a, translation, for, their, subjects, to, understand, it, was, difficult, to, determine, what, moctezuma, said, according, to, an, indigenous, account, he, said, to, cort, s, you, have, come, to, sit, on, your, seat, of, authority, which, i, have, kept, for, a, while, for, you, where, i, have, been, in, charge, for, you, for, your, agents, the, rulers, however, these, words, might, be, a, polite, expression, that, was, meant, to, convey, the, exact, opposite, meaning, which, was, common, in, nahua, culture, moctezuma, might, have, intended, these, words, to, assert, his, stature, and, multigenerational, legitimacy, also, according, to, spanish, law, the, king, had, no, right, to, demand, that, foreign, peoples, become, his, subjects, but, he, had, every, right, to, bring, rebels, to, heel, therefore, to, give, the, spanish, the, necessary, legitimacy, to, wage, war, against, the, indigenous, people, cort, s, might, just, have, said, what, the, spanish, king, needed, to, hear, six, days, after, their, arrival, moctezuma, became, a, prisoner, in, his, own, house, exactly, why, this, happened, is, not, clear, from, the, extant, sources, according, to, the, spanish, the, arrest, was, made, as, a, result, of, an, attack, perpetrated, by, a, tribute, collector, from, nautla, named, qualpopoca, or, quetzalpopoca, on, a, spanish, totonac, garrison, the, garrison, was, under, the, command, of, a, spanish, captain, named, juan, de, escalante, and, the, attack, was, in, retaliation, for, the, totonac, rebellion, against, moctezuma, which, started, in, july, 1519, after, the, spanish, arrived, this, attack, resulted, in, the, death, of, many, totonacs, and, approximately, seven, spaniards, including, escalante, though, some, spaniards, described, that, this, was, the, only, reason, for, moctezuma, s, arrest, others, have, suspected, that, escalante, s, death, was, merely, used, as, an, excuse, by, cort, s, to, imprison, moctezuma, and, usurp, power, over, mexico, positing, that, cort, s, might, have, planned, to, imprison, moctezuma, before, they, even, met, cort, s, himself, admitted, that, he, imprisoned, moctezuma, primarily, to, avoid, losing, control, over, mexico, understanding, that, nearly, all, of, his, forces, were, within, his, domains, moctezuma, claimed, innocence, for, this, incident, claiming, that, though, he, was, aware, of, the, attack, as, quetzalpopoca, brought, him, the, severed, head, of, a, spaniard, as, a, demonstration, of, his, success, he, never, ordered, it, and, was, highly, displeased, by, these, events, around, 20, days, after, his, arrest, quetzalpopoca, was, captured, together, with, his, son, and, 15, nobles, who, allegedly, participated, in, the, attack, and, after, a, brief, interrogation, he, admitted, that, indeed, moctezuma, was, innocent, he, was, publicly, executed, by, burning, soon, after, but, moctezuma, remained, prisoner, regardless, despite, his, imprisonment, moctezuma, continued, to, live, a, somewhat, comfortable, life, being, free, to, perform, many, of, his, daily, activities, and, being, respected, as, a, monarch, cort, s, himself, even, ordered, for, any, soldiers, who, disrespected, him, to, be, physically, and, roughly, punished, regardless, of, rank, or, position, however, despite, still, being, treated, as, a, respected, monarch, he, had, virtually, lost, most, of, his, power, as, emperor, as, the, spaniards, oversaw, nearly, all, of, his, activities, moctezuma, repeatedly, protected, the, spaniards, against, potential, threats, using, the, little, power, he, had, left, either, under, the, threat, of, the, spanish, or, by, his, own, will, such, as, during, the, succession, crisis, in, texcoco, mentioned, above, when, he, ordered, for, the, ruler, of, texcoco, cacamatzin, to, be, arrested, as, he, was, planning, to, form, an, army, to, attack, the, spaniards, the, aztec, nobility, reportedly, became, increasingly, displeased, with, the, large, spanish, army, staying, in, tenochtitl, n, and, moctezuma, told, cort, s, that, it, would, be, best, if, they, left, shortly, thereafter, in, april, 1520, cort, s, left, to, fight, p, nfilo, de, narv, ez, who, had, landed, in, mexico, to, arrest, cort, s, during, his, absence, tensions, between, spaniards, and, aztecs, exploded, into, the, massacre, in, the, great, temple, and, moctezuma, became, a, hostage, used, by, the, spaniards, to, ensure, their, security, in, the, subsequent, battles, with, the, spaniards, after, cort, s, return, moctezuma, was, killed, the, details, of, his, death, are, unknown, with, different, versions, of, his, demise, given, by, different, sources, in, his, historia, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, states, that, on, 29, june, 1520, the, spanish, forced, moctezuma, to, appear, on, the, balcony, of, his, palace, appealing, to, his, countrymen, to, retreat, four, leaders, of, the, aztec, army, met, with, moctezuma, to, talk, urging, their, countrymen, to, cease, their, constant, firing, upon, the, stronghold, for, a, time, d, az, states, many, of, the, mexican, chieftains, and, captains, knew, him, well, and, at, once, ordered, their, people, to, be, silent, and, not, to, discharge, darts, stones, or, arrows, and, four, of, them, reached, a, spot, where, montezuma, could, speak, to, them, d, az, alleges, that, the, aztecs, informed, moctezuma, that, a, relative, of, his, had, risen, to, the, throne, and, ordered, their, attack, to, continue, until, all, of, the, spanish, were, annihilated, but, expressed, remorse, at, moctezuma, s, captivity, and, stated, that, they, intended, to, revere, him, even, more, if, they, could, rescue, him, regardless, of, the, earlier, orders, to, hold, fire, however, the, discussion, between, moctezuma, and, the, aztec, leaders, was, immediately, followed, by, an, outbreak, of, violence, the, aztecs, disgusted, by, the, actions, of, their, leader, renounced, moctezuma, and, named, his, brother, cuitl, huac, tlatoani, in, his, place, to, pacify, his, people, and, undoubtedly, pressured, by, the, spanish, moctezuma, spoke, to, a, crowd, but, was, struck, dead, by, a, rock, d, az, gives, this, account, they, had, hardly, finished, this, speech, when, suddenly, such, a, shower, of, stones, and, darts, were, discharged, that, our, men, who, were, shielding, him, having, neglected, for, a, moment, their, duty, because, they, saw, how, the, attack, ceased, while, he, spoke, to, them, he, was, hit, by, three, stones, one, on, the, head, another, on, the, arm, and, another, on, the, leg, and, although, they, begged, him, to, have, the, wounds, dressed, and, to, take, food, and, spoke, kind, words, to, him, about, it, he, would, not, indeed, when, we, least, expected, it, they, came, to, say, that, he, was, dead, franciscan, friar, bernardino, de, sahag, n, oversaw, the, recording, of, two, versions, of, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, from, the, tenochtitl, n, tlatelolco, viewpoint, book, 12, of, the, florentine, codex, which, indigenous, scholars, composed, under, sahag, n, s, tutelage, is, an, illustrative, spanish, and, nahuatl, account, of, the, conquest, which, attributes, moctezuma, ii, s, death, to, spanish, conquistadors, according, to, the, codex, the, bodies, of, moctezuma, and, itzquauhtzin, were, cast, out, of, the, palace, by, the, spanish, the, body, of, moctezuma, was, gathered, up, and, cremated, at, copulco, and, four, days, after, they, had, been, hurled, from, the, temple, came, to, cast, away, moctezuma, and, itzquauhtzin, who, had, died, at, the, water, s, edge, at, a, place, called, teoayoc, for, at, that, place, there, was, the, image, of, a, turtle, carved, of, stone, the, stone, had, an, appearance, like, that, of, a, turtle, history, of, the, indies, of, new, spain, by, dominican, friar, diego, dur, n, references, both, spanish, and, indigenous, accounts, of, moctezuma, ii, s, death, dur, n, notes, that, spanish, historians, and, the, former, conquistador, he, interviewed, recall, moctezuma, dying, to, aztec, projectiles, however, his, indigenous, text, and, a, historical, informant, claimed, that, cort, s, forces, stabbed, moctezuma, to, death, in, other, indigenous, annals, the, aztecs, found, moctezuma, strangled, to, death, in, his, palace, the, spaniards, were, forced, to, flee, the, city, and, they, took, refuge, in, tlaxcala, and, signed, a, treaty, with, the, natives, there, to, conquer, tenochtitl, n, offering, the, tlaxcalans, control, of, tenochtitl, n, and, freedom, from, any, kind, of, tribute, moctezuma, was, then, succeeded, by, his, brother, cuitl, huac, who, died, shortly, afterwards, during, a, smallpox, epidemic, he, was, succeeded, by, his, adolescent, nephew, cuauht, moc, during, the, siege, of, the, city, the, sons, of, moctezuma, were, murdered, by, the, aztecs, possibly, because, they, wanted, to, surrender, by, the, following, year, the, aztec, empire, had, fallen, to, an, army, of, spanish, and, their, native, american, allies, primarily, tlaxcalans, who, were, traditional, enemies, of, the, aztecs, the, firsthand, account, of, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, s, true, history, of, the, conquest, of, new, spain, paints, a, portrait, of, a, noble, leader, who, struggles, to, maintain, order, in, his, kingdom, after, he, is, taken, prisoner, by, hern, n, cort, s, in, his, first, description, of, moctezuma, d, az, del, castillo, writes, the, great, montezuma, was, about, forty, years, old, of, good, height, well, proportioned, spare, and, slight, and, not, very, dark, though, of, the, usual, indian, complexion, he, did, not, wear, his, hair, long, but, just, over, his, ears, and, he, had, a, short, black, beard, well, shaped, and, thin, his, face, was, rather, long, and, cheerful, he, had, fine, eyes, and, in, his, appearance, and, manner, could, express, geniality, or, when, necessary, a, serious, composure, he, was, very, neat, and, clean, and, took, a, bath, every, afternoon, he, had, many, women, as, his, mistresses, the, daughters, of, chieftains, but, two, legitimate, wives, who, were, caciques, in, their, own, right, and, only, some, of, his, servants, knew, of, it, he, was, quite, free, from, sodomy, the, clothes, he, wore, one, day, he, did, not, wear, again, till, three, or, four, days, later, he, had, a, guard, of, two, hundred, chieftains, lodged, in, rooms, beside, his, own, only, some, of, whom, were, permitted, to, speak, to, him, when, moctezuma, was, allegedly, killed, by, being, stoned, to, death, by, his, people, cort, s, and, all, of, us, captains, and, soldiers, wept, for, him, and, there, was, no, one, among, us, that, knew, him, and, had, dealings, with, him, who, did, not, mourn, him, as, if, he, were, our, father, which, was, not, surprising, since, he, was, so, good, it, was, stated, that, he, had, reigned, for, seventeen, years, and, was, the, best, king, they, ever, had, in, mexico, and, that, he, had, personally, triumphed, in, three, wars, against, countries, he, had, subjugated, i, have, spoken, of, the, sorrow, we, all, felt, when, we, saw, that, montezuma, was, dead, we, even, blamed, the, mercedarian, friar, for, not, having, persuaded, him, to, become, a, christian, unlike, bernal, d, az, who, was, recording, his, memories, many, years, after, the, fact, cort, s, wrote, his, cartas, de, relaci, n, letters, from, mexico, to, justify, his, actions, to, the, spanish, crown, his, prose, is, characterized, by, simple, descriptions, and, explanations, along, with, frequent, personal, addresses, to, the, king, in, his, second, letter, cort, s, describes, his, first, encounter, with, moctezuma, thus, moctezuma, came, to, greet, us, and, with, him, some, two, hundred, lords, all, barefoot, and, dressed, in, a, different, costume, but, also, very, rich, in, their, way, and, more, so, than, the, others, they, came, in, two, columns, pressed, very, close, to, the, walls, of, the, street, which, is, very, wide, and, beautiful, and, so, straight, that, you, can, see, from, one, end, to, the, other, moctezuma, came, down, the, middle, of, this, street, with, two, chiefs, one, on, his, right, hand, and, the, other, on, his, left, and, they, were, all, dressed, alike, except, that, moctezuma, wore, sandals, whereas, the, others, went, barefoot, and, they, held, his, arm, on, either, side, anthony, pagden, and, eulalia, guzm, n, have, pointed, out, the, biblical, messages, that, cort, s, seems, to, ascribe, to, moctezuma, s, retelling, of, the, legend, of, quetzalcoatl, as, a, vengeful, messiah, who, would, return, to, rule, over, the, mexica, pagden, has, written, that, there, is, no, preconquest, tradition, which, places, quetzalcoatl, in, this, role, and, it, seems, possible, therefore, that, it, was, elaborated, by, sahag, n, and, motolin, a, from, informants, who, themselves, had, partially, lost, contact, with, their, traditional, tribal, histories, the, florentine, codex, made, by, bernardino, de, sahag, n, and, indigenous, scholars, under, his, tutelage, relied, on, native, informants, from, tlatelolco, and, generally, portrays, tlatelolco, and, tlatelolcan, rulers, in, a, favorable, light, relative, to, those, of, tenochtitlan, historian, matthew, restall, claims, that, the, codex, depicts, moctezuma, as, weak, willed, superstitious, and, indulgent, james, lockhart, suggests, that, moctezuma, fills, the, role, of, a, scapegoat, for, the, aztec, defeat, other, historians, have, noted, that, the, codex, may, not, necessarily, cast, moctezuma, as, cowardly, and, responsible, for, spanish, colonization, rebecca, dufendach, argues, that, the, codex, reflects, the, native, informants, uniquely, indigenous, manner, of, portraying, leaders, who, suffered, from, poor, health, brought, on, by, fright, fernando, alvarado, tezoz, moc, who, may, have, written, the, cr, nica, mexicayotl, was, possibly, a, grandson, of, moctezuma, ii, his, chronicle, may, relate, mostly, to, the, genealogy, of, the, aztec, rulers, he, described, moctezuma, s, issue, and, estimated, them, to, be, nineteen, eleven, sons, and, eight, daughters, some, of, the, aztec, stories, about, moctezuma, describe, him, as, being, fearful, of, the, spanish, newcomers, and, some, sources, such, as, the, florentine, codex, comment, that, the, aztecs, believed, the, spaniards, to, be, gods, and, cort, s, to, be, the, returned, god, quetzalcoatl, the, veracity, of, this, claim, is, difficult, to, ascertain, though, some, recent, ethnohistorians, specializing, in, early, spanish, nahua, relations, have, discarded, it, as, post, conquest, mythicalization, much, of, the, idea, of, cort, s, being, seen, as, a, deity, can, be, traced, back, to, the, florentine, codex, written, some, 50, years, after, the, conquest, in, the, codex, s, description, of, the, first, meeting, between, moctezuma, and, cort, s, the, aztec, ruler, is, described, as, giving, a, prepared, speech, in, classical, oratorical, nahuatl, a, speech, which, as, described, verbatim, in, the, codex, written, by, sahag, n, s, tlatelolcan, informants, included, such, prostrate, declarations, of, divine, or, near, divine, admiration, as, you, have, graciously, come, on, earth, you, have, graciously, approached, your, water, your, high, place, of, mexico, you, have, come, down, to, your, mat, your, throne, which, i, have, briefly, kept, for, you, i, who, used, to, keep, it, for, you, and, you, have, graciously, arrived, you, have, known, pain, you, have, known, weariness, now, come, on, earth, take, your, rest, enter, into, your, palace, rest, your, limbs, may, our, lords, come, on, earth, while, some, historians, such, as, warren, h, carroll, consider, this, as, evidence, that, moctezuma, was, at, least, open, to, the, possibility, that, the, spaniards, were, divinely, sent, based, on, the, quetzalcoatl, legend, others, such, as, matthew, restall, argue, that, moctezuma, politely, offered, his, throne, to, cort, s, if, indeed, he, did, ever, give, the, speech, as, reported, may, well, have, been, meant, as, the, exact, opposite, of, what, it, was, taken, to, mean, as, politeness, in, aztec, culture, was, a, way, to, assert, dominance, and, show, superiority, other, parties, have, also, propagated, the, idea, that, the, native, americans, believed, the, conquistadors, to, be, gods, most, notably, the, historians, of, the, franciscan, order, such, as, fray, ger, nimo, de, mendieta, bernardino, de, sahag, n, who, compiled, the, florentine, codex, was, also, a, franciscan, priest, bernardino, de, sahag, n, 1499, 1590, includes, in, book, 12, of, the, florentine, codex, eight, events, said, to, have, occurred, before, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, these, were, purportedly, interpreted, as, signs, of, a, possible, disaster, e, g, a, comet, the, burning, of, a, temple, a, crying, ghostly, woman, and, others, some, speculate, that, the, aztecs, were, particularly, susceptible, to, such, ideas, of, doom, and, disaster, because, the, particular, year, in, which, the, spanish, arrived, coincided, with, a, tying, of, years, ceremony, at, the, end, of, a, 52, year, cycle, in, the, aztec, calendar, which, in, aztec, belief, was, linked, to, changes, rebirth, and, dangerous, events, the, belief, of, the, aztecs, being, rendered, passive, by, their, superstition, is, referred, to, by, matthew, restall, as, part, of, the, myth, of, native, desolation, to, which, he, dedicates, chapter, 6, in, his, book, seven, myths, of, the, spanish, conquest, these, legends, are, likely, a, part, of, the, post, conquest, rationalization, by, the, aztecs, of, their, defeat, and, serve, to, show, moctezuma, as, indecisive, vain, and, superstitious, and, ultimately, the, cause, of, the, fall, of, the, aztec, empire, according, to, 16th, century, spanish, historian, diego, dur, n, who, was, one, of, the, most, important, chroniclers, of, the, indigenous, stories, of, the, empire, nezahualpilli, was, among, those, who, informed, moctezuma, of, the, imminent, destruction, of, the, empire, by, a, foreign, invader, warning, him, that, omens, confirming, his, fears, will, soon, appear, this, warning, caused, moctezuma, great, fear, and, he, made, a, series, of, erratic, decisions, immediately, after, such, as, severe, punishments, against, his, soldiers, for, disappointing, results, after, battles, against, the, tlaxcalans, ethnohistorian, susan, gillespie, has, argued, that, the, nahua, understanding, of, history, as, repeating, itself, in, cycles, also, led, to, a, subsequent, rationalization, of, the, events, of, the, conquests, in, this, interpretation, the, description, of, moctezuma, the, final, ruler, of, the, aztec, empire, before, the, spanish, conquest, was, tailored, to, fit, the, role, of, earlier, rulers, of, ending, dynasties, for, example, quetzalcoatl, the, mythical, last, ruler, of, the, toltecs, in, any, case, it, is, within, the, realm, of, possibility, that, the, description, of, moctezuma, in, post, conquest, sources, was, coloured, by, his, role, as, a, monumental, closing, figure, of, aztec, history, moctezuma, had, numerous, wives, and, concubines, by, whom, he, fathered, an, enormous, family, but, only, two, women, held, the, position, of, queen, tlapalizquixochtzin, and, teotlalco, his, partnership, with, tlapalizquixochtzin, daughter, of, matlaccoatzin, of, ecatepec, also, made, him, king, consort, of, ecatepec, since, she, was, queen, of, that, city, however, spanish, accounts, describe, that, very, few, people, in, mexico, knew, that, these, two, women, held, such, positions, of, power, some, of, those, who, knew, being, a, few, of, his, close, servants, of, his, many, wives, may, be, named, the, princesses, teitlalco, acatlan, and, miahuaxochitl, of, whom, the, first, named, appears, to, have, been, the, only, legitimate, consort, by, her, he, left, a, son, chimalpopoca, who, fell, during, the, noche, triste, and, a, daughter, tecuichpoch, later, baptized, as, isabel, moctezuma, by, the, princess, acatlan, were, left, two, daughters, baptized, as, maria, and, mariana, also, known, as, leonor, the, latter, alone, left, offspring, from, whom, descends, the, sotelo, montezuma, family, though, the, exact, number, of, his, children, is, unknown, and, the, names, of, most, of, them, have, been, lost, to, history, according, to, a, spanish, chronicler, by, the, time, he, was, taken, captive, moctezuma, had, fathered, 100, children, and, fifty, of, his, wives, and, concubines, were, then, in, some, stage, of, pregnancy, though, this, estimate, may, have, been, exaggerated, as, aztec, culture, made, class, distinctions, between, the, children, of, senior, wives, lesser, wives, and, concubines, not, all, of, his, children, were, considered, equal, in, nobility, or, inheritance, rights, among, his, many, children, were, princess, isabel, moctezuma, princess, mariana, leonor, moctezuma, and, sons, chimalpopoca, not, to, be, confused, with, the, previous, huey, tlatoani, and, tlaltecatzin, moctezuma, was, physically, fit, and, practised, a, variety, of, sports, among, them, archery, and, swimming, he, was, well, trained, in, the, arts, of, war, as, he, was, experienced, on, the, battlefield, from, an, early, age, among, the, sports, he, practised, he, was, an, active, hunter, and, often, used, to, hunt, for, deer, rabbits, and, various, birds, in, a, certain, section, of, a, forest, likely, the, bosque, de, chapultepec, that, was, exclusive, to, him, and, whomever, he, invited, it, was, prohibited, for, anyone, without, permission, to, enter, and, allegedly, any, trespassers, would, be, put, to, death, he, also, used, to, invite, servants, to, this, forest, should, he, order, for, certain, animals, to, be, hunted, for, him, which, would, often, be, done, for, the, entertainment, of, his, guests, moctezuma, was, recorded, to, have, been, heavily, obsessed, with, cleanliness, and, personal, hygiene, such, as, bathing, multiple, times, a, day, in, his, private, pool, as, well, as, not, wearing, the, same, clothes, every, day, a, spanish, soldier, accompanying, hernan, cort, s, during, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, reported, that, when, moctezuma, ii, dined, he, took, no, other, beverage, than, chocolate, served, in, a, golden, goblet, moctezuma, was, passionate, about, chocolate, he, had, it, flavoured, with, vanilla, or, other, spices, such, as, chili, peppers, and, his, chocolate, was, whipped, into, a, froth, that, dissolved, in, the, mouth, no, fewer, than, 60, portions, each, day, reportedly, may, have, been, consumed, by, moctezuma, ii, and, 2, 000, more, by, the, nobles, of, his, court, several, lines, of, descendants, exist, in, mexico, and, spain, through, moctezuma, ii, s, son, and, daughters, notably, tlacahuepan, ihualicahuaca, or, pedro, moctezuma, and, tecuichpoch, ixcaxochitzin, or, isabel, moctezuma, following, the, conquest, moctezuma, s, daughter, techichpotzin, or, tecuichpoch, became, known, as, isabel, moctezuma, and, was, given, a, large, estate, by, cort, s, who, also, fathered, a, child, by, her,

served, as, secretary, of, public, education, of, the, government, of, mexico, many, indigenous, peoples, in, mexico, are, reported, to, worship, deities, named, after, the, aztec, ruler, and, often,

moctezumas, hubert, howe, bancroft, writing, in, the, 19th, century, native, races, volume, 3, speculated, that, the, name, of, the, historical, aztec, emperor, moctezuma, had, been, used, to, refer, to, a, combination, of, different, cultural, heroes, who, were, united, under, the, name, of, a, particular, salient, representative, of, mesoamerican, identity, as, a, symbol, of, resistance, against, the, spanish, the, name, of, moctezuma, has, been, invoked, in, several, indigenous, rebellions, one, such, example, was, the, rebellion, of, the, virgin, cult, in, chiapas, in, 1721, where, the, followers, of, the, virgin, mary, rebelled, against, the, spanish, after, having, been, told, by, an, apparition, of, the, virgin, that, moctezuma, would, be, resuscitated, to, assist, them,
