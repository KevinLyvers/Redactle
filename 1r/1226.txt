of, southwest, china, and, he, tried, to, ally, himself, with, local, generals, such, as, wang, fuchen, the, kangxi, emperor, employed, generals, including, zhou, peigong, and, tuhai, to, suppress, the, rebellion, and, also, granted, clemency, to, common, people, caught, up, in, the, war, he, intended, to, personally, lead, the, armies, to, crush, the, rebels, but, his, subjects, advised, him,
