and, singing, style, she, became, the, earliest, guide, for, composers, on, how, to, arrange, music, for, popular, songs, and, numerous, musicians, reproduced, their, work, by, imitating, her, an, important, piece, of, testimony, to, this, is, the, use, of, saxophone, introduced, by, teng, her, frequent, use, of, jazz, or, jazz, influenced, ensembles, in, her, music, set, the, standard, for, saxophone, performance, practice, in, mainland, pop, today, another, aspect, of, teng, s, influence, was, the, establishment, of, a, breath, singing, method, jin, pointed, out, that, before, this,

of, their, voice, which, was, later, named, popular, singing, teng, s, songs, were, centred, on, a, range, of, subjects, most, primarily, love, and, human, relations, the, most, lacking, elements, in, mainland, culture, at, the, time, by, the, early, 1970s, as, rates, of, radio, ownership, began, to, increase, especially, of, cheap, and, portable, transistor, models, listening, to, teng, s, music, became, the, primary, attraction, author, ah, cheng, recalled, hearing, her, music, for, the, first, time, in, 1975, as, a, sort, of, excitement, and, extreme, addiction, that, he, and, his, friends, would, press, their, ears, to, the, wooden, frame, of, a, shortwave, radio, only, to, get, her, voice, heard, his, account, of, his, internal, exile, in, the, mountains, of, yunnan, is, better,

cigarette, for, people, who, listen, to, enemy, radio, radio, from, the, center, or, the, official, newspaper, was, merely, a, supplemental, reference, but, listening, to, enemy, radio, was, not, about, political, news, so, much, as, entertainment, i, remember, that, whenever, the, australian, national, station, broadcast, a, radio, play, of, the, taiwanese, film, the, story, of, a, small, town, everyone, would, bring, their, own, radio, because, the, shortwave, signal, would, tend, to, drift, and, that, way, we, could, cover, the, entire, frequency, range, and, make, sure, we, had, continuous, sound, from, at, least, one, receiver, at, a, time, the, boys, and, girls, sitting, around, that, grass, hut, would, be, in, tears, especially, when, teresa, teng, s, voice, rang, out,
