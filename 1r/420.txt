western, theatre, culture, and, politics, extended, from, the, 1880s, to, his, death, and, beyond, he, wrote, more, than, sixty, plays, including, major, works, such, as, man, and, superman, 1902,

on, a, rigorous, process, of, self, education, by, the, mid, 1880s, he, had, become, a, respected, theatre, and, music, critic, following, a, political, awakening, he, joined, the, gradualist, fabian, society, and, became, its, most, prominent, pamphleteer, shaw, had, been, writing, plays, for, years, before, his, first, public, success, arms, and, the, man, in, 1894, influenced, by, henrik, ibsen, he, sought, to, introduce, a, new, realism, into, english, language, drama, using, his, plays, as, vehicles, to, disseminate, his, political, social, and, religious, ideas, by, the, early, twentieth, century, his, reputation, as, a, dramatist, was, secured, with, a, series, of, critical, and, popular, successes, that, included, major, barbara, the, doctor, s, dilemma, and, caesar, and, cleopatra, shaw, s, expressed, views, were, often, contentious, he, promoted, eugenics, and, alphabet, reform, and, opposed, vaccination, and, organised, religion, he, courted, unpopularity, by, denouncing, both, sides, in, the, first, world, war, as, equally, culpable, and, although, not, a, republican, castigated, british, policy, on, ireland, in, the, postwar, period, these, stances, had, no, lasting, effect, on, his, standing, or, productivity, as, a, dramatist, the, inter, war, years, saw, a, series, of, often, ambitious, plays, which, achieved, varying, degrees, of, popular, success, in, 1938, he, provided, the, screenplay, for, a, filmed, version, of, pygmalion, for, which, he, received, an, academy, award, his, appetite, for, politics, and, controversy, remained, undiminished, by, the, late, 1920s, he, had, largely, renounced, fabian, society, gradualism, and, often, wrote, and, spoke, favourably, of, dictatorships, of, the, right, and, left, he, expressed, admiration, for, both, mussolini, and, stalin, in, the, final, decade, of, his, life, he, made, fewer, public, statements, but, continued, to, write, prolifically, until, shortly, before, his, death, aged, ninety, four, having, refused, all, state, honours, including, the, order, of, merit, in, 1946, since, shaw, s, death, scholarly, and, critical, opinion, about, his, works, has, varied, but, he, has, regularly, been, rated, among, british, dramatists, as, second, only, to, shakespeare, analysts, recognise, his, extensive, influence, on, generations, of, english, language, playwrights, the, word, shavian, has, entered, the, language, as, encapsulating, shaw, s, ideas, and, his, means, of, expressing, them, shaw, was, born, at, 3, upper, synge, street, in, portobello, a, lower, middle, class, part, of, dublin, he, was, the, youngest, child, and, only, son, of, george, carr, shaw, and, lucinda, elizabeth, bessie, shaw, n, e, gurly, his, elder, siblings, were, lucinda, lucy, frances, and, elinor, agnes, the, shaw, family, was, of, english, descent, and, belonged, to, the, dominant, protestant, ascendancy, in, ireland, george, carr, shaw, an, ineffectual, alcoholic, was, among, the, family, s, less, successful, members, his, relatives, secured, him, a, sinecure, in, the, civil, service, from, which, he, was, pensioned, off, in, the, early, 1850s, thereafter, he, worked, irregularly, as, a, corn, merchant, in, 1852, he, married, bessie, gurly, in, the, view, of, shaw, s, biographer, michael, holroyd, she, married, to, escape, a, tyrannical, great, aunt, if, as, holroyd, and, others, surmise, george, s, motives, were, mercenary, then, he, was, disappointed, as, bessie, brought, him, little, of, her, family, s, money, she, came, to, despise, her, ineffectual, and, often, drunken, husband, with, whom, she, shared, what, their, son, later, described, as, a, life, of, shabby, genteel, poverty, by, the, time, of, shaw, s, birth, his, mother, had, become, close, to, george, john, lee, a, flamboyant, figure, well, known, in, dublin, s, musical, circles, shaw, retained, a, lifelong, obsession, that, lee, might, have, been, his, biological, father, there, is, no, consensus, among, shavian, scholars, on, the, likelihood, of, this, the, young, shaw, suffered, no, harshness, from, his, mother, but, he, later, recalled, that, her, indifference, and, lack, of, affection, hurt, him, deeply, he, found, solace, in, the, music, that, abounded, in, the, house, lee, was, a, conductor, and, teacher, of, singing, bessie, had, a, fine, mezzo, soprano, voice, and, was, much, influenced, by, lee, s, unorthodox, method, of, vocal, production, the, shaws, house, was, often, filled, with, music, with, frequent, gatherings, of, singers, and, players, in, 1862, lee, and, the, shaws, agreed, to, share, a, house, no, 1, hatch, street, in, an, affluent, part, of, dublin, and, a, country, cottage, on, dalkey, hill, overlooking, killiney, bay, shaw, a, sensitive, boy, found, the, less, salubrious, parts, of, dublin, shocking, and, distressing, and, was, happier, at, the, cottage, lee, s, students, often, gave, him, books, which, the, young, shaw, read, avidly, thus, as, well, as, gaining, a, thorough, musical, knowledge, of, choral, and, operatic, works, he, became, familiar, with, a, wide, spectrum, of, literature, between, 1865, and, 1871, shaw, attended, four, schools, all, of, which, he, hated, his, experiences, as, a, schoolboy, left, him, disillusioned, with, formal, education, schools, and, schoolmasters, he, later, wrote, were, prisons, and, turnkeys, in, which, children, are, kept, to, prevent, them, disturbing, and, chaperoning, their, parents, in, october, 1871, he, left, school, to, become, a, junior, clerk, in, a, dublin, firm, of, land, agents, where, he, worked, hard, and, quickly, rose, to, become, head, cashier, during, this, period, shaw, was, known, as, george, shaw, after, 1876, he, dropped, the, george, and, styled, himself, bernard, shaw, in, june, 1873, lee, left, dublin, for, london, and, never, returned, a, fortnight, later, bessie, followed, him, the, two, girls, joined, her, shaw, s, explanation, of, why, his, mother, followed, lee, was, that, without, the, latter, s, financial, contribution, the, joint, household, had, to, be, broken, up, left, in, dublin, with, his, father, shaw, compensated, for, the, absence, of, music, in, the, house, by, teaching, himself, to, play, the, piano, early, in, 1876, shaw, learned, from, his, mother, that, agnes, was, dying, of, tuberculosis, he, resigned, from, the, land, agents, and, in, march, travelled, to, england, to, join, his, mother, and, lucy, at, agnes, s, funeral, he, never, again, lived, in, ireland, and, did, not, visit, it, for, twenty, nine, years, initially, shaw, refused, to, seek, clerical, employment, in, london, his, mother, allowed, him, to, live, free, of, charge, in, her, house, in, south, kensington, but, he, nevertheless, needed, an, income, he, had, abandoned, a, teenage, ambition, to, become, a, painter, and, had, not, yet, thought, of, writing, for, a, living, but, lee, found, a, little, work, for, him, ghost, writing, a, musical, column, printed, under, lee, s, name, in, a, satirical, weekly, the, hornet, lee, s, relations, with, bessie, deteriorated, after, their, move, to, london, shaw, maintained, contact, with, lee, who, found, him, work, as, a, rehearsal, pianist, and, occasional, singer, eventually, shaw, was, driven, to, applying, for, office, jobs, in, the, interim, he, secured, a, reader, s, pass, for, the, british, museum, reading, room, the, forerunner, of, the, british, library, and, spent, most, weekdays, there, reading, and, writing, his, first, attempt, at, drama, begun, in, 1878, was, a, blank, verse, satirical, piece, on, a, religious, theme, it, was, abandoned, unfinished, as, was, his, first, try, at, a, novel, his, first, completed, novel, immaturity, 1879, was, too, grim, to, appeal, to, publishers, and, did, not, appear, until, the, 1930s, he, was, employed, briefly, by, the, newly, formed, edison, telephone, company, in, 1879, 80, and, as, in, dublin, achieved, rapid, promotion, nonetheless, when, the, edison, firm, merged, with, the, rival, bell, telephone, company, shaw, chose, not, to, seek, a, place, in, the, new, organisation, thereafter, he, pursued, a, full, time, career, as, an, author, for, the, next, four, years, shaw, made, a, negligible, income, from, writing, and, was, subsidised, by, his, mother, in, 1881, for, the, sake, of, economy, and, increasingly, as, a, matter, of, principle, he, became, a, vegetarian, in, the, same, year, he, suffered, an, attack, of, smallpox, eventually, he, grew, a, beard, to, hide, the, resultant, facial, scar, in, rapid, succession, he, wrote, two, more, novels, the, irrational, knot, 1880, and, love, among, the, artists, 1881, but, neither, found, a, publisher, each, was, serialised, a, few, years, later, in, the, socialist, magazine, our, corner, in, 1880, shaw, began, attending, meetings, of, the, zetetical, society, whose, objective, was, to, search, for, truth, in, all, matters, affecting, the, interests, of, the, human, race, here, he, met, sidney, webb, a, junior, civil, servant, who, like, shaw, was, busy, educating, himself, despite, difference, of, style, and, temperament, the, two, quickly, recognised, qualities, in, each, other, and, developed, a, lifelong, friendship, shaw, later, reflected, you, knew, everything, that, i, didn, t, know, and, i, knew, everything, you, didn, t, know, we, had, everything, to, learn, from, one, another, and, brains, enough, to, do, it, shaw, s, next, attempt, at, drama, was, a, one, act, playlet, in, french, un, petit, drame, written, in, 1884, but, not, published, in, his, lifetime, in, the, same, year, the, critic, william, archer, suggested, a, collaboration, with, a, plot, by, archer, and, dialogue, by, shaw, the, project, foundered, but, shaw, returned, to, the, draft, as, the, basis, of, widowers, houses, in, 1892, and, the, connection, with, archer, proved, of, immense, value, to, shaw, s, career, on, 5, september, 1882, shaw, attended, a, meeting, at, the, memorial, hall, farringdon, addressed, by, the, political, economist, henry, george, shaw, then, read, george, s, book, progress, and, poverty, which, awakened, his, interest, in, economics, he, began, attending, meetings, of, the, social, democratic, federation, sdf, where, he, discovered, the, writings, of, karl, marx, and, thereafter, spent, much, of, 1883, reading, das, kapital, he, was, not, impressed, by, the, sdf, s, founder, h, m, hyndman, whom, he, found, autocratic, ill, tempered, and, lacking, leadership, qualities, shaw, doubted, the, ability, of, the, sdf, to, harness, the, working, classes, into, an, effective, radical, movement, and, did, not, join, it, he, preferred, he, said, to, work, with, his, intellectual, equals, after, reading, a, tract, why, are, the, many, poor, issued, by, the, recently, formed, fabian, society, shaw, went, to, the, society, s, next, advertised, meeting, on, 16, may, 1884, he, became, a, member, in, september, and, before, the, year, s, end, had, provided, the, society, with, its, first, manifesto, published, as, fabian, tract, no, 2, he, joined, the, society, s, executive, committee, in, january, 1885, and, later, that, year, recruited, webb, and, also, annie, besant, a, fine, orator, the, most, striking, result, of, our, present, system, of, farming, out, the, national, land, and, capital, to, private, individuals, has, been, the, division, of, society, into, hostile, classes, with, large, appetites, and, no, dinners, at, one, extreme, and, large, dinners, and, no, appetites, at, the, other, shaw, fabian, tract, no, 2, a, manifesto, 1884, from, 1885, to, 1889, shaw, attended, the, fortnightly, meetings, of, the, british, economic, association, it, was, holroyd, observes, the, closest, shaw, had, ever, come, to, university, education, this, experience, changed, his, political, ideas, he, moved, away, from, marxism, and, became, an, apostle, of, gradualism, when, in, 1886, 87, the, fabians, debated, whether, to, embrace, anarchism, as, advocated, by, charlotte, wilson, besant, and, others, shaw, joined, the, majority, in, rejecting, this, approach, after, a, rally, in, trafalgar, square, addressed, by, besant, was, violently, broken, up, by, the, authorities, on, 13, november, 1887, bloody, sunday, shaw, became, convinced, of, the, folly, of, attempting, to, challenge, police, power, thereafter, he, largely, accepted, the, principle, of, permeation, as, advocated, by, webb, the, notion, whereby, socialism, could, best, be, achieved, by, infiltration, of, people, and, ideas, into, existing, political, parties, throughout, the, 1880s, the, fabian, society, remained, small, its, message, of, moderation, frequently, unheard, among, more, strident, voices, its, profile, was, raised, in, 1889, with, the, publication, of, fabian, essays, in, socialism, edited, by, shaw, who, also, provided, two, of, the, essays, the, second, of, these, transition, details, the, case, for, gradualism, and, permeation, asserting, that, the, necessity, for, cautious, and, gradual, change, must, be, obvious, to, everyone, in, 1890, shaw, produced, tract, no, 13, what, socialism, is, a, revision, of, an, earlier, tract, in, which, charlotte, wilson, had, defined, socialism, in, anarchistic, terms, in, shaw, s, new, version, readers, were, assured, that, socialism, can, be, brought, about, in, a, perfectly, constitutional, manner, by, democratic, institutions, the, mid, 1880s, marked, a, turning, point, in, shaw, s, life, both, personally, and, professionally, he, lost, his, virginity, had, two, novels, published, and, began, a, career, as, a, critic, he, had, been, celibate, until, his, twenty, ninth, birthday, when, his, shyness, was, overcome, by, jane, jenny, patterson, a, widow, some, years, his, senior, their, affair, continued, not, always, smoothly, for, eight, years, shaw, s, sex, life, has, caused, much, speculation, and, debate, among, his, biographers, but, there, is, a, consensus, that, the, relationship, with, patterson, was, one, of, his, few, non, platonic, romantic, liaisons, the, published, novels, neither, commercially, successful, were, his, two, final, efforts, in, this, genre, cashel, byron, s, profession, written, in, 1882, 83, and, an, unsocial, socialist, begun, and, finished, in, 1883, the, latter, was, published, as, a, serial, in, to, day, magazine, in, 1884, although, it, did, not, appear, in, book, form, until, 1887, cashel, byron, appeared, in, magazine, and, book, form, in, 1886, in, 1884, and, 1885, through, the, influence, of, archer, shaw, was, engaged, to, write, book, and, music, criticism, for, london, papers, when, archer, resigned, as, art, critic, of, the, world, in, 1886, he, secured, the, succession, for, shaw, the, two, figures, in, the, contemporary, art, world, whose, views, shaw, most, admired, were, william, morris, and, john, ruskin, and, he, sought, to, follow, their, precepts, in, his, criticisms, their, emphasis, on, morality, appealed, to, shaw, who, rejected, the, idea, of, art, for, art, s, sake, and, insisted, that, all, great, art, must, be, didactic, of, shaw, s, various, reviewing, activities, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, it, was, as, a, music, critic, that, he, was, best, known, after, serving, as, deputy, in, 1888, he, became, musical, critic, of, the, star, in, february, 1889, writing, under, the, pen, name, corno, di, bassetto, in, may, 1890, he, moved, back, to, the, world, where, he, wrote, a, weekly, column, as, g, b, s, for, more, than, four, years, in, the, 2016, version, of, the, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, robert, anderson, writes, shaw, s, collected, writings, on, music, stand, alone, in, their, mastery, of, english, and, compulsive, readability, shaw, ceased, to, be, a, salaried, music, critic, in, august, 1894, but, published, occasional, articles, on, the, subject, throughout, his, career, his, last, in, 1950, from, 1895, to, 1898, shaw, was, the, theatre, critic, for, the, saturday, review, edited, by, his, friend, frank, harris, as, at, the, world, he, used, the, by, line, g, b, s, he, campaigned, against, the, artificial, conventions, and, hypocrisies, of, the, victorian, theatre, and, called, for, plays, of, real, ideas, and, true, characters, by, this, time, he, had, embarked, in, earnest, on, a, career, as, a, playwright, i, had, rashly, taken, up, the, case, and, rather, than, let, it, collapse, i, manufactured, the, evidence, after, using, the, plot, of, the, aborted, 1884, collaboration, with, archer, to, complete, widowers, houses, it, was, staged, twice, in, london, in, december, 1892, shaw, continued, writing, plays, at, first, he, made, slow, progress, the, philanderer, written, in, 1893, but, not, published, until, 1898, had, to, wait, until, 1905, for, a, stage, production, similarly, mrs, warren, s, profession, 1893, was, written, five, years, before, publication, and, nine, years, before, reaching, the, stage, shaw, s, first, play, to, bring, him, financial, success, was, arms, and, the, man, 1894, a, mock, ruritanian, comedy, satirising, conventions, of, love, military, honour, and, class, the, press, found, the, play, overlong, and, accused, shaw, of, mediocrity, sneering, at, heroism, and, patriotism, heartless, cleverness, and, copying, w, s, gilbert, s, style, the, public, took, a, different, view, and, the, management, of, the, theatre, staged, extra, matin, e, performances, to, meet, the, demand, the, play, ran, from, april, to, july, toured, the, provinces, and, was, staged, in, new, york, it, earned, him, 341, in, royalties, in, its, first, year, a, sufficient, sum, to, enable, him, to, give, up, his, salaried, post, as, a, music, critic, among, the, cast, of, the, london, production, was, florence, farr, with, whom, shaw, had, a, romantic, relationship, between, 1890, and, 1894, much, resented, by, jenny, patterson, the, success, of, arms, and, the, man, was, not, immediately, replicated, candida, which, presented, a, young, woman, making, a, conventional, romantic, choice, for, unconventional, reasons, received, a, single, performance, in, south, shields, in, 1895, in, 1897, a, playlet, about, napoleon, called, the, man, of, destiny, had, a, single, staging, at, croydon, in, the, 1890s, shaw, s, plays, were, better, known, in, print, than, on, the, west, end, stage, his, biggest, success, of, the, decade, was, in, new, york, in, 1897, when, richard, mansfield, s, production, of, the, historical, melodrama, the, devil, s, disciple, earned, the, author, more, than, 2, 000, in, royalties, in, january, 1893, as, a, fabian, delegate, shaw, attended, the, bradford, conference, which, led, to, the, foundation, of, the, independent, labour, party, he, was, sceptical, about, the, new, party, and, scorned, the, likelihood, that, it, could, switch, the, allegiance, of, the, working, class, from, sport, to, politics, he, persuaded, the, conference, to, adopt, resolutions, abolishing, indirect, taxation, and, taxing, unearned, income, to, extinction, back, in, london, shaw, produced, what, margaret, cole, in, her, fabian, history, terms, a, grand, philippic, against, the, minority, liberal, administration, that, had, taken, power, in, 1892, to, your, tents, o, israel, excoriated, the, government, for, ignoring, social, issues, and, concentrating, solely, on, irish, home, rule, a, matter, shaw, declared, of, no, relevance, to, socialism, in, 1894, the, fabian, society, received, a, substantial, bequest, from, a, sympathiser, henry, hunt, hutchinson, holroyd, mentions, 10, 000, webb, who, chaired, the, board, of, trustees, appointed, to, supervise, the, legacy, proposed, to, use, most, of, it, to, found, a, school, of, economics, and, politics, shaw, demurred, he, thought, such, a, venture, was, contrary, to, the, specified, purpose, of, the, legacy, he, was, eventually, persuaded, to, support, the, proposal, and, the, london, school, of, economics, and, political, science, lse, opened, in, the, summer, of, 1895, by, the, later, 1890s, shaw, s, political, activities, lessened, as, he, concentrated, on, making, his, name, as, a, dramatist, in, 1897, he, was, persuaded, to, fill, an, uncontested, vacancy, for, a, vestryman, parish, councillor, in, london, s, st, pancras, district, at, least, initially, shaw, took, to, his, municipal, responsibilities, seriously, when, london, government, was, reformed, in, 1899, and, the, st, pancras, vestry, became, the, metropolitan, borough, of, st, pancras, he, was, elected, to, the, newly, formed, borough, council, in, 1898, as, a, result, of, overwork, shaw, s, health, broke, down, he, was, nursed, by, charlotte, payne, townshend, a, rich, anglo, irish, woman, whom, he, had, met, through, the, webbs, the, previous, year, she, had, proposed, that, she, and, shaw, should, marry, he, had, declined, but, when, she, insisted, on, nursing, him, in, a, house, in, the, country, shaw, concerned, that, this, might, cause, scandal, agreed, to, their, marriage, the, ceremony, took, place, on, 1, june, 1898, in, the, register, office, in, covent, garden, the, bride, and, bridegroom, were, both, aged, forty, one, in, the, view, of, the, biographer, and, critic, st, john, ervine, their, life, together, was, entirely, felicitous, there, were, no, children, of, the, marriage, which, it, is, generally, believed, was, never, consummated, whether, this, was, wholly, at, charlotte, s, wish, as, shaw, liked, to, suggest, is, less, widely, credited, in, the, early, weeks, of, the, marriage, shaw, was, much, occupied, writing, his, marxist, analysis, of, wagner, s, ring, cycle, published, as, the, perfect, wagnerite, late, in, 1898, in, 1906, the, shaws, found, a, country, home, in, ayot, st, lawrence, hertfordshire, they, renamed, the, house, shaw, s, corner, and, lived, there, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, they, retained, a, london, flat, in, the, adelphi, and, later, at, whitehall, court, during, the, first, decade, of, the, twentieth, century, shaw, secured, a, firm, reputation, as, a, playwright, in, 1904, j, e, vedrenne, and, harley, granville, barker, established, a, company, at, the, royal, court, theatre, in, sloane, square, chelsea, to, present, modern, drama, over, the, next, five, years, they, staged, fourteen, of, shaw, s, plays, the, first, john, bull, s, other, island, a, comedy, about, an, englishman, in, ireland, attracted, leading, politicians, and, was, seen, by, edward, vii, who, laughed, so, much, that, he, broke, his, chair, the, play, was, withheld, from, dublin, s, abbey, theatre, for, fear, of, the, affront, it, might, provoke, although, it, was, shown, at, the, city, s, royal, theatre, in, november, 1907, shaw, later, wrote, that, william, butler, yeats, who, had, requested, the, play, got, rather, more, than, he, bargained, for, it, was, uncongenial, to, the, whole, spirit, of, the, neo, gaelic, movement, which, is, bent, on, creating, a, new, ireland, after, its, own, ideal, whereas, my, play, is, a, very, uncompromising, presentment, of, the, real, old, ireland, nonetheless, shaw, and, yeats, were, close, friends, yeats, and, lady, gregory, tried, unsuccessfully, to, persuade, shaw, to, take, up, the, vacant, co, directorship, of, the, abbey, theatre, after, j, m, synge, s, death, in, 1909, shaw, admired, other, figures, in, the, irish, literary, revival, including, george, russell, and, james, joyce, and, was, a, close, friend, of, se, n, o, casey, who, was, inspired, to, become, a, playwright, after, reading, john, bull, s, other, island, man, and, superman, completed, in, 1902, was, a, success, both, at, the, royal, court, in, 1905, and, in, robert, loraine, s, new, york, production, in, the, same, year, among, the, other, shaw, works, presented, by, vedrenne, and, granville, barker, were, major, barbara, 1905, depicting, the, contrasting, morality, of, arms, manufacturers, and, the, salvation, army, the, doctor, s, dilemma, 1906, a, mostly, serious, piece, about, professional, ethics, and, caesar, and, cleopatra, shaw, s, counterblast, to, shakespeare, s, antony, and, cleopatra, seen, in, new, york, in, 1906, and, in, london, the, following, year, now, prosperous, and, established, shaw, experimented, with, unorthodox, theatrical, forms, described, by, his, biographer, stanley, weintraub, as, discussion, drama, and, serious, farce, these, plays, included, getting, married, premiered, 1908, the, shewing, up, of, blanco, posnet, 1909, misalliance, 1910, and, fanny, s, first, play, 1911, blanco, posnet, was, banned, on, religious, grounds, by, the, lord, chamberlain, the, official, theatre, censor, in, england, and, was, produced, instead, in, dublin, it, filled, the, abbey, theatre, to, capacity, fanny, s, first, play, a, comedy, about, suffragettes, had, the, longest, initial, run, of, any, shaw, play, 622, performances, androcles, and, the, lion, 1912, a, less, heretical, study, of, true, and, false, religious, attitudes, than, blanco, posnet, ran, for, eight, weeks, in, september, and, october, 1913, it, was, followed, by, one, of, shaw, s, most, successful, plays, pygmalion, written, in, 1912, and, staged, in, vienna, the, following, year, and, in, berlin, shortly, afterwards, shaw, commented, it, is, the, custom, of, the, english, press, when, a, play, of, mine, is, produced, to, inform, the, world, that, it, is, not, a, play, that, it, is, dull, blasphemous, unpopular, and, financially, unsuccessful, hence, arose, an, urgent, demand, on, the, part, of, the, managers, of, vienna, and, berlin, that, i, should, have, my, plays, performed, by, them, first, the, british, production, opened, in, april, 1914, starring, sir, herbert, tree, and, mrs, patrick, campbell, as, respectively, a, professor, of, phonetics, and, a, cockney, flower, girl, there, had, earlier, been, a, romantic, liaison, between, shaw, and, campbell, that, caused, charlotte, shaw, considerable, concern, but, by, the, time, of, the, london, premiere, it, had, ended, the, play, attracted, capacity, audiences, until, july, when, tree, insisted, on, going, on, holiday, and, the, production, closed, his, co, star, then, toured, with, the, piece, in, the, us, in, 1899, when, the, boer, war, began, shaw, wished, the, fabians, to, take, a, neutral, stance, on, what, he, deemed, like, home, rule, to, be, a, non, socialist, issue, others, including, the, future, labour, prime, minister, ramsay, macdonald, wanted, unequivocal, opposition, and, resigned, from, the, society, when, it, followed, shaw, in, the, fabians, war, manifesto, fabianism, and, the, empire, 1900, shaw, declared, that, until, the, federation, of, the, world, becomes, an, accomplished, fact, we, must, accept, the, most, responsible, imperial, federations, available, as, a, substitute, for, it, as, the, new, century, began, shaw, became, increasingly, disillusioned, by, the, limited, impact, of, the, fabians, on, national, politics, thus, although, a, nominated, fabian, delegate, he, did, not, attend, the, london, conference, at, the, memorial, hall, farringdon, street, in, february, 1900, that, created, the, labour, representation, committee, precursor, of, the, modern, labour, party, by, 1903, when, his, term, as, borough, councillor, expired, he, had, lost, his, earlier, enthusiasm, writing, after, six, years, of, borough, councilling, i, am, convinced, that, the, borough, councils, should, be, abolished, nevertheless, in, 1904, he, stood, in, the, london, county, council, elections, after, an, eccentric, campaign, which, holroyd, characterises, as, absolutely, certain, of, not, getting, in, he, was, duly, defeated, it, was, shaw, s, final, foray, into, electoral, politics, nationally, the, 1906, general, election, produced, a, huge, liberal, majority, and, an, intake, of, 29, labour, members, shaw, viewed, this, outcome, with, scepticism, he, had, a, low, opinion, of, the, new, prime, minister, sir, henry, campbell, bannerman, and, saw, the, labour, members, as, inconsequential, i, apologise, to, the, universe, for, my, connection, with, such, a, body, in, the, years, after, the, 1906, election, shaw, felt, that, the, fabians, needed, fresh, leadership, and, saw, this, in, the, form, of, his, fellow, writer, h, g, wells, who, had, joined, the, society, in, february, 1903, wells, s, ideas, for, reform, particularly, his, proposals, for, closer, cooperation, with, the, independent, labour, party, placed, him, at, odds, with, the, society, s, old, gang, led, by, shaw, according, to, cole, wells, had, minimal, capacity, for, putting, across, in, public, meetings, against, shaw, s, trained, and, practised, virtuosity, in, shaw, s, view, the, old, gang, did, not, extinguish, mr, wells, he, annihilated, himself, wells, resigned, from, the, society, in, september, 1908, shaw, remained, a, member, but, left, the, executive, in, april, 1911, he, later, wondered, whether, the, old, gang, should, have, given, way, to, wells, some, years, earlier, god, only, knows, whether, the, society, had, not, better, have, done, it, although, less, active, he, blamed, his, advancing, years, shaw, remained, a, fabian, in, 1912, shaw, invested, 1, 000, for, a, one, fifth, share, in, the, webbs, new, publishing, venture, a, socialist, weekly, magazine, called, the, new, statesman, which, appeared, in, april, 1913, he, became, a, founding, director, publicist, and, in, due, course, a, contributor, mostly, anonymously, he, was, soon, at, odds, with, the, magazine, s, editor, clifford, sharp, who, by, 1916, was, rejecting, his, contributions, the, only, paper, in, the, world, that, refuses, to, print, anything, by, me, according, to, shaw, i, see, the, junkers, and, militarists, of, england, and, germany, jumping, at, the, chance, they, have, longed, for, in, vain, for, many, years, of, smashing, one, another, and, establishing, their, own, oligarchy, as, the, dominant, military, power, of, the, world, shaw, common, sense, about, the, war, 1914, after, the, first, world, war, began, in, august, 1914, shaw, produced, his, tract, common, sense, about, the, war, which, argued, that, the, warring, nations, were, equally, culpable, such, a, view, was, anathema, in, an, atmosphere, of, fervent, patriotism, and, offended, many, of, shaw, s, friends, ervine, records, that, is, appearance, at, any, public, function, caused, the, instant, departure, of, many, of, those, present, despite, his, errant, reputation, shaw, s, propagandist, skills, were, recognised, by, the, british, authorities, and, early, in, 1917, he, was, invited, by, field, marshal, haig, to, visit, the, western, front, battlefields, shaw, s, 10, 000, word, report, which, emphasised, the, human, aspects, of, the, soldier, s, life, was, well, received, and, he, became, less, of, a, lone, voice, in, april, 1917, he, joined, the, national, consensus, in, welcoming, america, s, entry, into, the, war, a, first, class, moral, asset, to, the, common, cause, against, junkerism, three, short, plays, by, shaw, were, premiered, during, the, war, the, inca, of, perusalem, written, in, 1915,

his, bit, a, genial, farce, was, granted, a, licence, it, opened, at, the, royal, court, in, january, 1917, shaw, had, long, supported, the, principle, of, irish, home, rule, within, the, british, empire, which, he, thought, should, become, the, british, commonwealth, in, april, 1916, he, wrote, scathingly, in, the, new, york, times, about, militant, irish, nationalism, in, point, of, learning, nothing, and, forgetting, nothing, these, fellow, patriots, of, mine, leave, the, bourbons, nowhere, total, independence, he, asserted, was, impractical, alliance, with, a, bigger, power, preferably, england, was, essential, the, dublin, easter, rising, later, that, month, took, him, by, surprise, after, its, suppression, by, british, forces, he, expressed, horror, at, the, summary, execution, of, the, rebel, leaders, but, continued, to, believe, in, some, form, of, anglo, irish, union, in, how, to, settle, the, irish, question, 1917, he, envisaged, a, federal, arrangement, with, national, and, imperial, parliaments, holroyd, records, that, by, this, time, the, separatist, party, sinn, f, in, was, in, the, ascendency, and, shaw, s, and, other, moderate, schemes, were, forgotten, in, the, postwar, period, shaw, despaired, of, the, british, government, s, coercive, policies, towards, ireland, and, joined, his, fellow, writers, hilaire, belloc, and, g, k, chesterton, in, publicly, condemning, these, actions, the, anglo, irish, treaty, of, december, 1921, led, to, the, partition, of, ireland, between, north, and, south, a, provision, that, dismayed, shaw, in, 1922, civil, war, broke, out, in, the, south, between, its, pro, treaty, and, anti, treaty, factions, the, former, of, whom, had, established, the, irish, free, state, shaw, visited, dublin, in, august, and, met, michael, collins, then, head, of, the, free, state, s, provisional, government, shaw, was, much, impressed, by, collins, and, was, saddened, when, three, days, later, the, irish, leader, was, ambushed, and, killed, by, anti, treaty, forces, in, a, letter, to, collins, s, sister, shaw, wrote, i, met, michael, for, the, first, and, last, time, on, saturday, last, and, am, very, glad, i, did, i, rejoice, in, his, memory, and, will, not, be, so, disloyal, to, it, as, to, snivel, over, his, valiant, death, shaw, remained, a, british, subject, all, his, life, but, took, dual, british, irish, nationality, in, 1934, shaw, s, first, major, work, to, appear, after, the, war, was, heartbreak, house, written, in, 1916, 17, and, performed, in, 1920, it, was, produced, on, broadway, in, november, and, was, coolly, received, according, to, the, times, mr, shaw, on, this, occasion, has, more, than, usual, to, say, and, takes, twice, as, long, as, usual, to, say, it, after, the, london, premiere, in, october, 1921, the, times, concurred, with, the, american, critics, as, usual, with, mr, shaw, the, play, is, about, an, hour, too, long, although, containing, much, entertainment, and, some, profitable, reflection, ervine, in, the, observer, thought, the, play, brilliant, but, ponderously, acted, except, for, edith, evans, as, lady, utterword, shaw, s, largest, scale, theatrical, work, was, back, to, methuselah, written, in, 1918, 20, and, staged, in, 1922, weintraub, describes, it, as, shaw, s, attempt, to, fend, off, the, bottomless, pit, of, an, utterly, discouraging, pessimism, this, cycle, of, five, interrelated, plays, depicts, evolution, and, the, effects, of, longevity, from, the, garden, of, eden, to, the, year, 31, 920, ad, critics, found, the, five, plays, strikingly, uneven, in, quality, and, invention, the, original, run, was, brief, and, the, work, has, been, revived, infrequently, shaw, felt, he, had, exhausted, his, remaining, creative, powers, in, the, huge, span, of, this, metabiological, pentateuch, he, was, now, sixty, seven, and, expected, to, write, no, more, plays, this, mood, was, short, lived, in, 1920, joan, of, arc, was, proclaimed, a, saint, by, pope, benedict, xv, shaw, had, long, found, joan, an, interesting, historical, character, and, his, view, of, her, veered, between, half, witted, genius, and, someone, of, exceptional, sanity, he, had, considered, writing, a, play, about, her, in, 1913, and, the, canonisation, prompted, him, to, return, to, the, subject, he, wrote, saint, joan, in, the, middle, months, of, 1923, and, the, play, was, premiered, on, broadway, in, december, it, was, enthusiastically, received, there, and, at, its, london, premiere, the, following, march, in, weintraub, s, phrase, even, the, nobel, prize, committee, could, no, longer, ignore, shaw, after, saint, joan, the, citation, for, the, literature, prize, for, 1925, praised, his, work, as, marked, by, both, idealism, and, humanity, its, stimulating, satire, often, being, infused, with, a, singular, poetic, beauty, he, accepted, the, award, but, rejected, the, monetary, prize, that, went, with, it, on, the, grounds, that, my, readers, and, my, audiences, provide, me, with, more, than, sufficient, money, for, my, needs, after, saint, joan, it, was, five, years, before, shaw, wrote, a, play, from, 1924, he, spent, four, years, writing, what, he, described, as, his, magnum, opus, a, political, treatise, entitled, the, intelligent, woman, s, guide, to, socialism, and, capitalism, the, book, was, published, in, 1928, and, sold, well, at, the, end, of, the, decade, shaw, produced, his, final, fabian, tract, a, commentary, on, the, league, of, nations, he, described, the, league, as, a, school, for, the, new, international, statesmanship, as, against, the, old, foreign, office, diplomacy, but, thought, that, it, had, not, yet, become, the, federation, of, the, world, shaw, returned, to, the, theatre, with, what, he, called, a, political, extravaganza, the, apple, cart, written, in, late, 1928, it, was, in, ervine, s, view, unexpectedly, popular, taking, a, conservative, monarchist, anti, democratic, line, that, appealed, to, contemporary, audiences, the, premiere, was, in, warsaw, in, june, 1928, and, the, first, british, production, was, two, months, later, at, sir, barry, jackson, s, inaugural, malvern, festival, the, other, eminent, creative, artist, most, closely, associated, with, the, festival, was, sir, edward, elgar, with, whom, shaw, enjoyed, a, deep, friendship, and, mutual, regard, he, described, the, apple, cart, to, elgar, as, a, scandalous, aristophanic, burlesque, of, democratic, politics, with, a, brief, but, shocking, sex, interlude, during, the, 1920s, shaw, began, to, lose, faith, in, the, idea, that, society, could, be, changed, through, fabian, gradualism, and, became, increasingly, fascinated, with, dictatorial, methods, in, 1922, he, had, welcomed, mussolini, s, accession, to, power, in, italy, observing, that, amid, the, indiscipline, and, muddle, and, parliamentary, deadlock, mussolini, was, the, right, kind, of, tyrant, shaw, was, prepared, to, tolerate, certain, dictatorial, excesses, weintraub, in, his, odnb, biographical, sketch, comments, that, shaw, s, flirtation, with, authoritarian, inter, war, regimes, took, a, long, time, to, fade, and, beatrice, webb, thought, he, was, obsessed, about, mussolini, we, the, undersigned, are, recent, visitors, to, the, ussr, we, desire, to, record, that, we, saw, nowhere, evidence, of, economic, slavery, privation, unemployment, and, cynical, despair, of, betterment, everywhere, we, saw, hopeful, and, enthusiastic, working, class, setting, an, example, of, industry, and, conduct, which, would, greatly, enrich, us, if, our, systems, supplied, our, workers, with, any, incentive, to, follow, it, letter, to, the, manchester, guardian, 2, march, 1933, signed, by, shaw, and, 20, others, shaw, s, enthusiasm, for, the, soviet, union, dated, to, the, early, 1920s, when, he, had, hailed, lenin, as, the, one, really, interesting, statesman, in, europe, having, turned, down, several, chances, to, visit, in, 1931, he, joined, a, party, led, by, nancy, astor, the, carefully, managed, trip, culminated, in, a, lengthy, meeting, with, stalin, whom, shaw, later, described, as, a, georgian, gentleman, with, no, malice, in, him, at, a, dinner, given, in, his, honour, shaw, told, the, gathering, i, have, seen, all, the, terrors, and, i, was, terribly, pleased, by, them, in, march, 1933, he, was, a, co, signatory, to, a, letter, in, the, manchester, guardian, protesting, at, the, continuing, misrepresentation, of, soviet, achievements, no, lie, is, too, fantastic, no, slander, is, too, stale, for, employment, by, the, more, reckless, elements, of, the, british, press, shaw, s, admiration, for, mussolini, and, stalin, demonstrated, his, growing, belief, that, dictatorship, was, the, only, viable, political, arrangement, when, the, nazi, party, came, to, power, in, germany, in, january, 1933, shaw, described, hitler, as, a, very, remarkable, man, a, very, able, man, and, professed, himself, proud, to, be, the, only, writer, in, england, who, was, scrupulously, polite, and, just, to, hitler, though, his, principal, admiration, was, for, stalin, whose, regime, he, championed, uncritically, throughout, the, decade, shaw, saw, the, 1939, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, as, a, triumph, for, stalin, who, he, said, now, had, hitler, under, his, thumb, shaw, s, first, play, of, the, decade, was, too, true, to, be, good, written, in, 1931, and, premiered, in, boston, in, february, 1932, the, reception, was, unenthusiastic, brooks, atkinson, of, the, new, york, times, commenting, that, shaw, had, yielded, to, the, impulse, to, write, without, having, a, subject, judged, the, play, a, rambling, and, indifferently, tedious, conversation, the, correspondent, of, the, new, york, herald, tribune, said, that, most, of, the, play, was, discourse, unbelievably, long, lectures, and, that, although, the, audience, enjoyed, the, play, it, was, bewildered, by, it, during, the, decade, shaw, travelled, widely, and, frequently, most, of, his, journeys, were, with, charlotte, she, enjoyed, voyages, on, ocean, liners, and, he, found, peace, to, write, during, the, long, spells, at, sea, shaw, met, an, enthusiastic, welcome, in, south, africa, in, 1932, despite, his, strong, remarks, about, the, racial, divisions, of, the, country, in, december, 1932, the, couple, embarked, on, a, round, the, world, cruise, in, march, 1933, they, arrived, at, san, francisco, to, begin, shaw, s, first, visit, to, the, us, he, had, earlier, refused, to, go, to, that, awful, country, that, uncivilized, place, unfit, to, govern, itself, illiberal, superstitious, crude, violent, anarchic, and, arbitrary, he, visited, hollywood, with, which, he, was, unimpressed, and, new, york, where, he, lectured, to, a, capacity, audience, in, the, metropolitan, opera, house, harried, by, the, intrusive, attentions, of, the, press, shaw, was, glad, when, his, ship, sailed, from, new, york, harbour, new, zealand, which, he, and, charlotte, visited, the, following, year, struck, him, as, the, best, country, i, ve, been, in, he, urged, its, people, to, be, more, confident, and, loosen, their, dependence, on, trade, with, britain, he, used, the, weeks, at, sea, to, complete, two, plays, the, simpleton, of, the, unexpected, isles, and, the, six, of, calais, and, begin, work, on, a, third, the, millionairess, despite, his, contempt, for, hollywood, and, its, aesthetic, values, shaw, was, enthusiastic, about, cinema, and, in, the, middle, of, the, decade, wrote, screenplays, for, prospective, film, versions, of, pygmalion, and, saint, joan, the, latter, was, never, made, but, shaw, entrusted, the, rights, to, the, former, to, the, unknown, gabriel, pascal, who, produced, it, at, pinewood, studios, in, 1938, shaw, was, determined, that, hollywood, should, have, nothing, to, do, with, the, film, but, was, powerless, to, keep, it, from, winning, one, academy, award, oscar, he, described, his, award, for, best, written, screenplay, as, an, insult, coming, from, such, a, source, he, became, the, first, person, to, have, been, awarded, both, a, nobel, prize, and, an, oscar, in, a, 1993, study, of, the, oscars, anthony, holden, observes, that, pygmalion, was, soon, spoken, of, as, having, lifted, movie, making, from, illiteracy, to, literacy, shaw, s, final, plays, of, the, 1930s, were, cymbeline, refinished, 1936, geneva, 1936, and, in, good, king, charles, s, golden, days, 1939, the, first, a, fantasy, reworking, of, shakespeare, made, little, impression, but, the, second, a, satire, on, european, dictators, attracted, more, notice, much, of, it, unfavourable, in, particular, shaw, s, parody, of, hitler, as, herr, battler, was, considered, mild, almost, sympathetic, the, third, play, an, historical, conversation, piece, first, seen, at, malvern, ran, briefly, in, london, in, may, 1940, james, agate, commented, that, the, play, contained, nothing, to, which, even, the, most, conservative, audiences, could, take, exception, and, though, it, was, long, and, lacking, in, dramatic, action, only, witless, and, idle, theatregoers, would, object, after, their, first, runs, none, of, the, three, plays, were, seen, again, in, the, west, end, during, shaw, s, lifetime, towards, the, end, of, the, decade, both, shaws, began, to, suffer, ill, health, charlotte, was, increasingly, incapacitated, by, paget, s, disease, of, bone, and, he, developed, pernicious, anaemia, his, treatment, involving, injections, of, concentrated, animal, liver, was, successful, but, this, breach, of, his, vegetarian, creed, distressed, him, and, brought, down, condemnation, from, militant, vegetarians, although, shaw, s, works, since, the, apple, cart, had, been, received, without, great, enthusiasm, his, earlier, plays, were, revived, in, the, west, end, throughout, the, second, world, war, starring, such, actors, as, edith, evans, john, gielgud, deborah, kerr, and, robert, donat, in, 1944, nine, shaw, plays, were, staged, in, london, including, arms, and, the, man, with, ralph, richardson, laurence, olivier, sybil, thorndike, and, margaret, leighton, in, the, leading, roles, two, touring, companies, took, his, plays, all, round, britain, the, revival, in, his, popularity, did, not, tempt, shaw, to, write, a, new, play, and, he, concentrated, on, prolific, journalism, a, second, shaw, film, produced, by, pascal, major, barbara, 1941, was, less, successful, both, artistically, and, commercially, than, pygmalion, partly, because, of, pascal, s, insistence, on, directing, to, which, he, was, unsuited, the, rest, of, shaw, s, life, was, quiet, and, solitary, the, loss, of, his, wife, was, more, profoundly, felt, than, he, had, ever, imagined, any, loss, could, be, for, he, prided, himself, on, a, stoical, fortitude, in, all, loss, and, misfortune, st, john, ervine, on, shaw, 1959, following, the, outbreak, of, war, on, 3, september, 1939, and, the, rapid, conquest, of, poland, shaw, was, accused, of, defeatism, when, in, a, new, statesman, article, he, declared, the, war, over, and, demanded, a, peace, conference, nevertheless, when, he, became, convinced, that, a, negotiated, peace, was, impossible, he, publicly, urged, the, neutral, united, states, to, join, the, fight, the, london, blitz, of, 1940, 41, led, the, shaws, both, in, their, mid, eighties, to, live, full, time, at, ayot, st, lawrence, even, there, they, were, not, immune, from, enemy, air, raids, and, stayed, on, occasion, with, nancy, astor, at, her, country, house, cliveden, in, 1943, the, worst, of, the, london, bombing, over, the, shaws, moved, back, to, whitehall, court, where, medical, help, for, charlotte, was, more, easily, arranged, her, condition, deteriorated, and, she, died, in, september, shaw, s, final, political, treatise, everybody, s, political, what, s, what, was, published, in, 1944, holroyd, describes, this, as, a, rambling, narrative, that, repeats, ideas, he, had, given, better, elsewhere, and, then, repeats, itself, the, book, sold, well, 85, 000, copies, by, the, end, of, the, year, after, hitler, s, suicide, in, may, 1945, shaw, approved, of, the, formal, condolences, offered, by, the, irish, taoiseach, amon, de, valera, at, the, german, embassy, in, dublin, shaw, disapproved, of, the, postwar, trials, of, the, defeated, german, leaders, as, an, act, of, self, righteousness, we, are, all, potential, criminals, pascal, was, given, a, third, opportunity, to,

europe, in, good, king, charles, s, golden, days, 1939, described, by, weintraub, as, a, warm, discursive, high, comedy, also, depicts, authoritarianism, but, less, satirically, than, geneva, as, in, earlier, decades, the, shorter, plays, were, generally, comedies, some, historical, and, others, addressing, various, political, and, social, preoccupations, of, the, author, ervine, writes, of, shaw, s, later, work, that, although, it, was, still, astonishingly, vigorous, and, vivacious, it, showed, unmistakable, signs, of, his, age, the, best, of, his, work, in, this, period, however, was, full, of, wisdom, and, the, beauty, of, mind, often, displayed, by, old, men, who, keep, their, wits, about, them, shaw, s, collected, musical, criticism, published, in, three, volumes, runs, to, more, than, 2, 700, pages, it, covers, the, british, musical, scene, from, 1876, to, 1950, but, the, core, of, the, collection, dates, from, his, six, years, as, music, critic, of, the, star, and, the, world, in, the, late, 1880s, and, early, 1890s, in, his, view, music, criticism, should, be, interesting, to, everyone, rather, than, just, the, musical, lite, and, he, wrote, for, the, non, specialist, avoiding, technical, jargon, mesopotamian, words, like, the, dominant, of, d, major, he, was, fiercely, partisan, in, his, columns, promoting, the, music, of, wagner, and, decrying, that, of, brahms, and, those, british, composers, such, as, stanford, and, parry, whom, he, saw, as, brahmsian, he, campaigned, against, the, prevailing, fashion, for, performances, of, handel, oratorios, with, huge, amateur, choirs, and, inflated, orchestration, calling, for, a, chorus, of, twenty, capable, artists, he, railed, against, opera, productions, unrealistically, staged, or, sung, in, languages, the, audience, did, not, speak, in, shaw, s, view, the, london, theatres, of, the, 1890s, presented, too, many, revivals, of, old, plays, and, not, enough, new, work, he, campaigned, against, melodrama, sentimentality, stereotypes, and, worn, out, conventions, as, a, music, critic, he, had, frequently, been, able, to, concentrate, on, analysing, new, works, but, in, the, theatre, he, was, often, obliged, to, fall, back, on, discussing, how, various, performers, tackled, well, known, plays, in, a, study, of, shaw, s, work, as, a, theatre, critic, e, j, west, writes, that, shaw, ceaselessly, compared, and, contrasted, artists, in, interpretation, and, in, technique, shaw, contributed, more, than, 150, articles, as, theatre, critic, for, the, saturday, review, in, which, he, assessed, more, than, 212, productions, he, championed, ibsen, s, plays, when, many, theatregoers, regarded, them, as, outrageous, and, his, 1891, book, quintessence, of, ibsenism, remained, a, classic, throughout, the, twentieth, century, of, contemporary, dramatists, writing, for, the, west, end, stage, he, rated, oscar, wilde, above, the, rest, our, only, thorough, playwright, he, plays, with, everything, with, wit, with, philosophy, with, drama, with, actors, and, audience, with, the, whole, theatre, shaw, s, collected, criticisms, were, published, as, our, theatres, in, the, nineties, in, 1932, shaw, maintained, a, provocative, and, frequently, self, contradictory, attitude, to, shakespeare, whose, name, he, insisted, on, spelling, shakespear, many, found, him, difficult, to, take, seriously, on, the, subject, duff, cooper, observed, that, by, attacking, shakespeare, it, is, shaw, who, appears, a, ridiculous, pigmy, shaking, his, fist, at, a, mountain, shaw, was, nevertheless, a, knowledgeable, shakespearian, and, in, an, article, in, which, he, wrote, with, the, single, exception, of, homer, there, is, no, eminent, writer, not, even, sir, walter, scott, whom, i, can, despise, so, entirely, as, i, despise, shakespear, when, i, measure, my, mind, against, his, he, also, said, but, i, am, bound, to, add, that, i, pity, the, man, who, cannot, enjoy, shakespear, he, has, outlasted, thousands, of, abler, thinkers, and, will, outlast, a, thousand, more, shaw, had, two, regular, targets, for, his, more, extreme, comments, about, shakespeare, undiscriminating, bardolaters, and, actors, and, directors, who, presented, insensitively, cut, texts, in, over, elaborate, productions, he, was, continually, drawn, back, to, shakespeare, and, wrote, three, plays, with, shakespearean, themes, the, dark, lady, of, the, sonnets, cymbeline, refinished, and, shakes, versus, shav, in, a, 2001, analysis, of, shaw, s, shakespearian, criticisms, robert, pierce, concludes, that, shaw, who, was, no, academic, saw, shakespeare, s, plays, like, all, theatre, from, an, author, s, practical, point, of, view, shaw, helps, us, to, get, away, from, the, romantics, picture, of, shakespeare, as, a, titanic, genius, one, whose, art, cannot, be, analyzed, or, connected, with, the, mundane, considerations, of, theatrical, conditions, and, profit, and, loss, or, with, a, specific, staging, and, cast, of, actors, shaw, s, political, and, social, commentaries, were, published, variously, in, fabian, tracts, in, essays, in, two, full, length, books, in, innumerable, newspaper, and, journal, articles, and, in, prefaces, to, his, plays, the, majority, of, shaw, s, fabian, tracts, were, published, anonymously, representing, the, voice, of, the, society, rather, than, of, shaw, although, the, society, s, secretary, edward, pease, later, confirmed, shaw, s, authorship, according, to, holroyd, the, business, of, the, early, fabians, mainly, under, the, influence, of, shaw, was, to, alter, history, by, rewriting, it, shaw, s, talent, as, a, pamphleteer, was, put, to, immediate, use, in, the, production, of, the, society, s, manifesto, after, which, says, holroyd, he, was, never, again, so, succinct, after, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, shaw, increasingly, propagated, his, ideas, through, the, medium, of, his, plays, an, early, critic, writing, in, 1904, observed, that, shaw, s, dramas, provided, a, pleasant, means, of, proselytising, his, socialism, adding, that, mr, shaw, s, views, are, to, be, sought, especially, in, the, prefaces, to, his, plays, after, loosening, his, ties, with, the, fabian, movement, in, 1911, shaw, s, writings, were, more, personal, and, often, provocative, his, response, to, the, furore, following, the, issue, of, common, sense, about, the, war, in, 1914, was, to, prepare, a, sequel, more, common, sense, about, the, war, in, this, he, denounced, the, pacifist, line, espoused, by, ramsay, macdonald, and, other, socialist, leaders, and, proclaimed, his, readiness, to, shoot, all, pacifists, rather, than, cede, them, power, and, influence, on, the, advice, of, beatrice, webb, this, pamphlet, remained, unpublished, the, intelligent, woman, s, guide, shaw, s, main, political, treatise, of, the, 1920s, attracted, both, admiration, and, criticism, macdonald, considered, it, the, world, s, most, important, book, since, the, bible, harold, laski, thought, its, arguments, outdated, and, lacking, in, concern, for, individual, freedoms, shaw, s, increasing, flirtation, with, dictatorial, methods, is, evident, in, many, of, his, subsequent, pronouncements, a, new, york, times, report, dated, 10, december, 1933, quoted, a, recent, fabian, society, lecture, in, which, shaw, had, praised, hitler, mussolini, and, stalin, hey, are, trying, to, get, something, done, are, adopting, methods, by, which, it, is, possible, to, get, something, done, as, late, as, the, second, world, war, in, everybody, s, political, what, s, what, shaw, blamed, the, allies, abuse, of, their, 1918, victory, for, the, rise, of, hitler, and, hoped, that, after, defeat, the, f, hrer, would, escape, retribution, to, enjoy, a, comfortable, retirement, in, ireland, or, some, other, neutral, country, these, sentiments, according, to, the, irish, philosopher, poet, thomas, duddy, rendered, much, of, the, shavian, outlook, pass, and, contemptible, creative, evolution, shaw, s, version, of, the, new, science, of, eugenics, became, an, increasing, theme, in, his, political, writing, after, 1900, he, introduced, his, theories, in, the, revolutionist, s, handbook, 1903, an, appendix, to, man, and, superman, and, developed, them, further, during, the, 1920s, in, back, to, methuselah, a, 1946, life, magazine, article, observed, that, shaw, had, always, tended, to, look, at, people, more, as, a, biologist, than, as, an, artist, by, 1933, in, the, preface, to, on, the, rocks, he, was, writing, that, if, we, desire, a, certain, type, of, civilization, and, culture, we, must, exterminate, the, sort, of, people, who, do, not, fit, into, it, critical, opinion, is, divided, on, whether, this, was, intended, as, irony, in, an, article, in, the, american, magazine, liberty, in, september, 1938, shaw, included, the, statement, there, are, many, people, in, the, world, who, ought, to, be, liquidated, many, commentators, assumed, that, such, comments, were, intended, as, a, joke, although, in, the, worst, possible, taste, otherwise, life, magazine, concluded, this, silliness, can, be, classed, with, his, more, innocent, bad, guesses, shaw, s, fiction, writing, was, largely, confined, to, the, five, unsuccessful, novels, written, in, the, period, 1879, 1885, immaturity, 1879, is, a, semi, autobiographical, portrayal, of, mid, victorian, england, shaw, s, own, david, copperfield, according, to, weintraub, the, irrational, knot, 1880, is, a, critique, of, conventional, marriage, in, which, weintraub, finds, the, characterisations, lifeless, hardly, more, than, animated, theories, shaw, was, pleased, with, his, third, novel, love, among, the, artists, 1881, feeling, that, it, marked, a, turning, point, in, his, development, as, a, thinker, although, he, had, no, more, success, with, it, than, with, its, predecessors, cashel, byron, s, profession, 1882, is, says, weintraub, an, indictment, of, society, which, anticipates, shaw, s, first, full, length, play, mrs, warren, s, profession, shaw, later, explained, that, he, had, intended, an, unsocial, socialist, as, the, first, section, of, a, monumental, depiction, of, the, downfall, of, capitalism, gareth, griffith, in, a, study, of, shaw, s, political, thought, sees, the, novel, as, an, interesting, record, of, conditions, both, in, society, at, large, and, in, the, nascent, socialist, movement, of, the, 1880s, shaw, s, only, subsequent, fiction, of, any, substance, was, his, 1932, novella, the, adventures, of, the, black, girl, in, her, search, for, god, written, during, a, visit, to, south, africa, in, 1932, the, eponymous, girl, intelligent, inquisitive, and, converted, to, christianity, by, insubstantial, missionary, teaching, sets, out, to, find, god, on, a, journey, that, after, many, adventures, and, encounters, leads, her, to, a, secular, conclusion, the, story, on, publication, offended, some, christians, and, was, banned, in, ireland, by, the, board, of, censors, shaw, was, a, prolific, correspondent, throughout, his, life, his, letters, edited, by, dan, h, laurence, were, published, between, 1965, and, 1988, shaw, once, estimated, his, letters, would, occupy, twenty, volumes, laurence, commented, that, unedited, they, would, fill, many, more, shaw, wrote, more, than, a, quarter, of, a, million, letters, of, which, about, ten, per, cent, have, survived, 2, 653, letters, are, printed, in, laurence, s, four, volumes, among, shaw, s, many, regular, correspondents,

shaw, scholar, fred, crawford, wrote, although, the, primary, interest, for, shavians, is, the, material, that, supplements, what, we, already, know, about, shaw, s, life, and, work, the, diaries, are, also, valuable, as, a, historical, and, sociological, document, of, english, life, at, the, end, of, the, victorian, age, after, 1897, pressure, of, other, writing, led, shaw, to, give, up, keeping, a, diary, through, his, journalism, pamphlets, and, occasional, longer, works, shaw, wrote, on, many, subjects, his, range, of, interest, and, enquiry, included, vivisection, vegetarianism, religion, language, cinema, and, photography, on, all, of, which, he, wrote, and, spoke, copiously, collections, of, his, writings, on, these, and, other, subjects, were, published, mainly, after, his, death, together, with, volumes, of, wit, and, wisdom, and, general, journalism, despite, the, many, books, written, about, him, holroyd, counts, 80, by, 1939, shaw, s, autobiographical, output,

his, death, he, revised, and, republished, as, sixteen, self, sketches, there, were, seventeen, he, made, it, clear, to, his, publishers, that, this, slim, book, was, in, no, sense, a, full,

contradictory, this, inconsistency, was, partly, an, intentional, provocation, the, spanish, scholar, statesman, salvador, de, madariaga, describes, shaw, as, a, pole, of, negative, electricity, set, in, a, people, of, positive, electricity, in, one, area, at, least, shaw, was, constant, in, his, lifelong, refusal, to, follow, normal, english, forms, of, spelling, and, punctuation, he, favoured, archaic, spellings, such, as, shew, for, show, he, dropped, the, u, in, words, like, honour, and, favour, and, wherever, possible, he, rejected, the, apostrophe, in, contractions, such, as, won, t, or, that, s, in, his, will, shaw, ordered, that, after, some, specified, legacies, his, remaining, assets, were, to, form, a, trust, to, pay, for, fundamental, reform, of, the, english, alphabet, into, a, phonetic, version, of, forty, letters, though, shaw, s, intentions, were, clear, his, drafting, was, flawed, and, the, courts, initially, ruled, the, intended, trust, void, a, later, out, of, court, agreement, provided, a, sum, of, 8, 300, for, spelling, reform, the, bulk, of, his, fortune, went, to, the, residuary, legatees, the, british, museum, the, royal, academy, of, dramatic, art, and, the, national, gallery, of, ireland, most, of, the, 8, 300, went, on, a, special, phonetic, edition, of, androcles, and, the, lion, in, the, shavian, alphabet, published, in, 1962, to, a, largely, indifferent, reception, shaw, s, views, on, religion, and, christianity, were, less, consistent, having, in, his, youth, proclaimed, himself, an, atheist, in, middle, age, he, explained, this, as, a, reaction, against, the, old, testament, image, of, a, vengeful, jehovah, by, the, early, twentieth, century, he, termed, himself, a, mystic, although, gary, sloan, in, an, essay, on, shaw, s, beliefs, disputes, his, credentials, as, such, in, 1913, shaw, declared, that, he, was, not, religious, in, the, sectarian, sense, aligning, himself, with, jesus, as, a, person, of, no, religion, in, the, preface, 1915, to, androcles, and, the, lion, shaw, asks, why, not, give, christianity, a, chance, contending, that, britain, s, social, order, resulted, from, the, continuing, choice, of, barabbas, over, christ, in, a, broadcast, just, before, the, second, world, war, shaw, invoked, the, sermon, on, the, mount, a, very, moving, exhortation, and, it, gives, you, one, first, rate, tip, which, is, to, do, good, to, those, who, despitefully, use, you, and, persecute, you, in, his, will, shaw, stated, that, his, religious, convictions, and, scientific, views, cannot, at, present, be, more, specifically, defined, than, as, those, of, a, believer, in, creative, revolution, he, requested, that, no, one, should, imply, that, he, accepted, the, beliefs, of, any, specific, religious, organisation, and, that, no, memorial, to, him, should, take, the, form, of, a, cross, or, any, other, instrument, of, torture, or, symbol, of, blood, sacrifice, shaw, espoused, racial, equality, and, inter, marriage, between, people, of, different, races, despite, his, expressed, wish, to, be, fair, to, hitler, he, called, anti, semitism, the, hatred, of, the, lazy, ignorant, fat, headed, gentile, for, the, pertinacious, jew, who, schooled, by, adversity, to, use, his, brains, to, the, utmost, outdoes, him, in, business, in, the, jewish, chronicle, he, wrote, in, 1932, in, every, country, you, can, find, rabid, people, who, have, a, phobia, against, jews, jesuits, armenians, negroes, freemasons, irishmen, or, simply, foreigners, as, such, political, parties, are, not, above, exploiting, these, fears, and, jealousies, in, 1903, shaw, joined, in, a, controversy, about, vaccination, against, smallpox, he, called, vaccination, a, peculiarly, filthy, piece, of, witchcraft, in, his, view, immunisation, campaigns, were, a, cheap, and, inadequate, substitute, for, a, decent, programme, of, housing, for, the, poor, which, would, he, declared, be, the, means, of, eradicating, smallpox, and, other, infectious, diseases, less, contentiously, shaw, was, keenly, interested, in, transport, laurence, observed, in, 1992, a, need, for, a, published, study, of, shaw, s, interest, in, bicycling, motorbikes, automobiles, and, planes, climaxing, in, his, joining, the, interplanetary, society, in, his, nineties, shaw, published, articles, on, travel, took, photographs, of, his, journeys, and, submitted, notes, to, the, royal, automobile, club, shaw, strove, throughout, his, adult, life, to, be, referred, to, as, bernard, shaw, rather, than, george, bernard, shaw, but, confused, matters, by, continuing, to, use, his, full, initials, g, b, s, as, a, by, line, and, often, signed, himself, g, bernard, shaw, he, left, instructions, in, his, will, that, his, executor, the, public, trustee, was, to, license, publication, of, his, works, only, under, the, name, bernard, shaw, shaw, scholars, including, ervine, judith, evans, holroyd, laurence,

establish, a, national, theatre, shaw, s, short, 1910, play, the, dark, lady, of, the, sonnets, in, which, shakespeare, pleads, with, queen, elizabeth, i, for, the, endowment, of, a, state, theatre,

elgar, s, third, symphony, and, was, the, dedicatee, of, the, severn, suite, 1930, the, substance, of, shaw, s, political, legacy, is, uncertain, in, 1921, shaw, s, erstwhile, collaborator, william, archer, in, a, letter, to, the, playwright, wrote, i, doubt, if, there, is, any, case, of, a, man, so, widely, read, heard, seen, and, known, as, yourself, who, has, produced, so, little, effect, on, his, generation, margaret, cole, who, considered, shaw, the, greatest, writer, of, his, age, professed, never, to, have, understood, him, she, thought, he, worked, immensely, hard, at, politics, but,

originator, of, ideas, he, was, an, insatiable, adopter, and, adapter, an, incomparable, prestidigitator, with, the, thoughts, of, the, forerunners, nietzsche, samuel, butler, erewhon, marx, shelley,
