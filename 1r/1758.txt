the, first, integrated, circuit, while, working, at, texas, instruments, ti, in, 1958, 22, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, on, 10, december, 2000, kilby, was, also, the, co, inventor, of, the, handheld, calculator, and, the, thermal, printer, for, which, he, had, the, patents, he, also, had, patents, for, seven, other, inventions, jack, kilby, was, born, in, 1923, in, jefferson, city, missouri, to, hubert, and, vina, freitag, kilby, both, parents, had, bachelor, of, science, degrees, from, the, university, of, illinois, his, father, was, a, manager, at, a, local,

invention, of, the, integrated, circuit, in, mid, 1958, as, a, newly, employed, engineer, at, texas, instruments, ti, he, did, not, yet, have, the, right, to, a, summer, vacation, kilby, spent, the, summer, working, on, the, problem, in, circuit, design, that, was, commonly, called, the, tyranny, of, numbers, and, he, finally, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, manufacturing, of, circuit, components, en, masse, in, a, single, piece, of, semiconductor, material, could, provide, a, solution, on, september, 12, he, presented, his, findings, to, company, s, management, which, included, mark, shepherd, he, showed, them, a, piece, of, germanium, with, an, oscilloscope, attached, pressed, a, switch, and, the, oscilloscope, showed, a, continuous, sine, wave, proving, that, his, integrated, circuit, worked, and, thus, that, he, had, solved, the, problem, u, s, patent, 3, 138, 743, for, miniaturized, electronic, circuits, the, first, integrated, circuit, was, filed, on, february, 6, 1959, it, was, notable, for, having, different, components, transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, etc, on, one, single, substrate, 22, along, with, robert, noyce, who, independently, made, a, similar, circuit, a, few, months, later, kilby, is, generally, credited, as, co, inventor, of, the, integrated, circuit, jack, kilby, went, on, to, pioneer, military, industrial, and, commercial, applications, of, microchip, technology, he, headed, teams, that, created, the, first, military, system, and, the, first, computer, incorporating, integrated, circuits, he, invented, the, handheld, calculator, along, with, jerry, merryman, and, james, van, tassel, in, 1970, he, took, a, leave, of, absence, from, ti, to, work, as, an, independent, inventor, he, explored, among, other, subjects, the, use, of, silicon, technology, for, generating, electrical, power, from, sunlight, from, 1978, to, 1984, he, held, the, position, of, distinguished, professor,
