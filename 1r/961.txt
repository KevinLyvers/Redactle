tried, to, curb, his, authority, during, this, period, michael, servetus, a, spaniard, regarded, by, both, roman, catholics, and, protestants, as, having, a, heretical, view, of, the, trinity, arrived, in, geneva, he, was, denounced, by, calvin, and, burned, at, the, stake, for, heresy, by, the, city, council, following, an, influx, of, supportive, refugees, and, new, elections, to, the, city, council, calvin, s, opponents, were, forced, out, calvin, spent, his, final, years, promoting, the, reformation, both, in, geneva, and, throughout, europe, john, calvin, was, born, as, jehan, cauvin, on, 10, july, 1509, at, noyon, a, town, in, picardy, a, province, of, the, kingdom, of, france, he, was, the, second, of, three, sons, who, survived, infancy, his, mother, jeanne, le, franc, was, the, daughter, of, an, innkeeper, from, cambrai, she, died, of, an, unknown, cause, in, calvin, s, childhood, after, having, borne, four, more, children, calvin, s, father, g, rard, cauvin, had, a, prosperous, career, as, the, cathedral, notary, and, registrar, to, the, ecclesiastical, court, g, rard, intended, his, three, sons, charles, jean, and, antoine, for, the, priesthood, young, calvin, was, particularly, precocious, by, age, 12, he, was, employed, by, the, bishop, as, a, clerk, and, received, the, tonsure, cutting, his, hair, to, symbolize, his, dedication, to, the, church, he, also, won, the, patronage, of, an, influential, family, the, montmors, through, their, assistance, calvin, was, able, to, attend, the, coll, ge, de, la, marche, paris, where, he, learned, latin, from, one, of, its, greatest, teachers, mathurin, cordier, once, he, completed, the, course, he, entered, the, coll, ge, de, montaigu, as, a, philosophy, student, in, 1525, or, 1526, g, rard, withdrew, his, son, from, the, coll, ge, de, montaigu, and, enrolled, him, in, the, university, of, orl, ans, to, study, law, according, to, contemporary, biographers, theodore, beza, and, nicolas, colladon, g, rard, believed, that, calvin, would, earn, more, money, as, a, lawyer, than, as, a, priest, after, a, few, years, of, quiet, study, calvin, entered, the, university, of, bourges, in, 1529, he, was, intrigued, by, andreas, alciati, a, humanist, lawyer, humanism, was, a, european, intellectual, movement, which, stressed, classical, studies, during, his, 18, month, stay, in, bourges, calvin, learned, koine, greek, a, necessity, for, studying, the, new, testament, alternative, theories, have, been, suggested, regarding, the, date, of, calvin, s, religious, conversion, some, have, placed, the, date, of, his, conversion, around, 1533, shortly, before, he, resigned, from, his, chaplaincy, in, this, view, his, resignation, is, the, direct, evidence, for, his, conversion, to, the, evangelical, faith, however, t, h, l, parker, argues, that, although, this, date, is, a, terminus, for, his, conversion, the, more, likely, date, is, in, late, 1529, or, early, 1530, the, main, evidence, for, his, conversion, is, contained, in, two, significantly, different, accounts, of, his, conversion, in, the, first, found, in, his, commentary, on, the, book, of, psalms, calvin, portrayed, his, conversion, as, a, sudden, change, of, mind, brought, about, by, god, god, by, a, sudden, conversion, subdued, and, brought, my, mind, to, a, teachable, frame, which, was, more, hardened, in, such, matters, than, might, have, been, expected, from, one, at, my, early, period, of, life, having, thus, received, some, taste, and, knowledge, of, true, godliness, i, was, immediately, inflamed, with, so, intense, a, desire, to, make, progress, therein, that, although, i, did, not, altogether, leave, off, other, studies, yet, i, pursued, them, with, less, ardor, in, the, second, account, calvin, wrote, of, a, long, process, of, inner, turmoil, followed, by, spiritual, and, psychological, anguish, being, exceedingly, alarmed, at, the, misery, into, which, i, had, fallen, and, much, more, at, that, which, threatened, me, in, view, of, eternal, death, i, duty, bound, made, it, my, first, business, to, betake, myself, to, your, way, condemning, my, past, life, not, without, groans, and, tears, and, now, o, lord, what, remains, to, a, wretch, like, me, but, instead, of, defense, earnestly, to, supplicate, you, not, to, judge, that, fearful, abandonment, of, your, word, according, to, its, deserts, from, which, in, your, wondrous, goodness, you, have, at, last, delivered, me, scholars, have, argued, about, the, precise, interpretation, of, these, accounts, but, most, agree, that, his, conversion, corresponded, with, his, break, from, the, roman, catholic, church, the, calvin, biographer, bruce, gordon, has, stressed, that, the, two, accounts, are, not, antithetical, revealing, some, inconsistency, in, calvin, s, memory, but, rather, two, different, ways, of, expressing, the, same, reality, by, 1532, calvin, received, his, licentiate, in, law, and, published, his, first, book, a, commentary, on, seneca, s, de, clementia, after, uneventful, trips, to, orl, ans, and, his, hometown, of, noyon, calvin, returned, to, paris, in, october, 1533, during, this, time, tensions, rose, at, the, coll, ge, royal, later, to, become, the, coll, ge, de, france, between, the, humanists, reformers, and, the, conservative, senior, faculty, members, one, of, the, reformers, nicolas, cop, was, rector, of, the, university, on, 1, november, 1533, he, devoted, his, inaugural, address, to, the, need, for, reform, and, renewal, in, the, roman, catholic, church, the, address, provoked, a, strong, reaction, from, the, faculty, who, denounced, it, as, heretical, forcing, cop, to, flee, to, basel, calvin, a, close, friend, of, cop, was, implicated, in, the, offense, and, for, the, next, year, he, was, forced, into, hiding, he, remained, on, the, move, sheltering, with, his, friend, louis, du, tillet, in, angoul, me, and, taking, refuge, in, noyon, and, orl, ans, he, was, finally, forced, to, flee, france, during, the, affair, of, the, placards, in, mid, october, 1534, in, that, incident, unknown, reformers, had, posted, placards, in, various, cities, criticizing, the, roman, catholic, mass, to, which, adherents, of, the, roman, catholic, church, responded, with, violence, against, the, would, be, reformers, and, their, sympathizers, in, january, 1535, calvin, joined, cop, in, basel, a, city, under, the, enduring, influence, of, the, late, reformer, johannes, oecolampadius, in, march, 1536, calvin, published, the, first, edition, of, his, institutio, christianae, religionis, or, institutes, of, the, christian, religion, the, work, was, an, apologia, or, defense, of, his, faith, and, a, statement, of, the, doctrinal, position, of, the, reformers, he, also, intended, it, to, serve, as, an, elementary, instruction, book, for, anyone, interested, in, the, christian, faith, the, book, was, the, first, expression, of, his, theology, calvin, updated, the, work, and, published, new, editions, throughout, his, life, shortly, after, its, publication, he, left, basel, for, ferrara, italy, where, he, briefly, served, as, secretary, to, princess, ren, e, of, france, by, june, he, was, back, in, paris, with, his, brother, antoine, who, was, resolving, their, father, s, affairs, following, the, edict, of, coucy, which, gave, a, limited, six, month, period, for, heretics, to, reconcile, with, the, catholic, faith, calvin, decided, that, there, was, no, future, for, him, in, france, in, august, he, set, off, for, strasbourg, a, free, imperial, city, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, a, refuge, for, reformers, due, to, military, maneuvers, of, imperial, and, french, forces, he, was, forced, to, make, a, detour, to, the, south, bringing, him, to, geneva, calvin, had, intended, to, stay, only, a, single, night, but, william, farel, a, fellow, french, reformer, residing, in, the, city, implored, him, to, stay, and, assist, him, in, his, work, of, reforming, the, church, there, calvin, accepted, his, new, role, without, any, preconditions, on, his, tasks, or, duties, the, office, to, which, he, was, initially, assigned, is, unknown, he, was, eventually, given, the, title, of, reader, which, most, likely, meant, that, he, could, give, expository, lectures, on, the, bible, sometime, in, 1537, he, was, selected, to, be, a, pastor, although, he, never, received, any, pastoral, consecration, for, the, first, time, the, lawyer, theologian, took, up, pastoral, duties, such, as, baptisms, weddings, and, church, services, during, late, 1536, farel, drafted, a, confession, of, faith, and, calvin, wrote, separate, articles, on, reorganizing, the, church, in, geneva, on, 16, january, 1537, farel, and, calvin, presented, their, articles, concernant, l, organisation, de, l, glise, et, du, culte, gen, ve, articles, on, the, organization, of, the, church, and, its, worship, at, geneva, to, the, city, council, the, document, described, the, manner, and, frequency, of, their, celebrations, of, the, eucharist, the, reason, for, and, the, method, of, excommunication, the, requirement, to, subscribe, to, the, confession, of, faith, the, use, of, congregational, singing, in, the, liturgy, and, the, revision, of, marriage, laws, the, council, accepted, the, document, on, the, same, day, as, the, year, progressed, calvin, and, farel, s, reputation, with, the, council, began, to, suffer, the, council, was, reluctant, to, enforce, the, subscription, requirement, as, only, a, few, citizens, had, subscribed, to, their, confession, of, faith, on, 26, november, the, two, ministers, hotly, debated, the, council, over, the, issue, furthermore, france, was, taking, an, interest, in, forming, an, alliance, with, geneva, and, as, the, two, ministers, were, frenchmen, councilors, had, begun, to, question, their, loyalty, finally, a, major, ecclesiastical, political, quarrel, developed, when, the, city, of, bern, geneva, s, ally, in, the, reformation, of, the, swiss, churches, proposed, to, introduce, uniformity, in, the, church, ceremonies, one, proposal, required, the, use, of, unleavened, bread, for, the, eucharist, the, two, ministers, were, unwilling, to, follow, bern, s, lead, and, delayed, the, use, of, such, bread, until, a, synod, in, zurich, could, be, convened, to, make, the, final, decision, the, council, ordered, calvin, and, farel, to, use, unleavened, bread, for, the, easter, eucharist, in, protest, they, refused, to, administer, communion, during, the, easter, service, this, caused, a, riot, during, the, service, the, next, day, the, council, told, farel, and, calvin, to, leave, geneva, farel, and, calvin, then, went, to, bern, and, zurich, to, plead, their, case, the, resulting, synod, in, zurich, placed, most, of, the, blame, on, calvin, for, not, being, sympathetic, enough, toward, the, people, of, geneva, it, asked, bern, to, mediate, with, the, aim, of, restoring, the, two, ministers, the, geneva, council, refused, to, readmit, the, two, men, who, then, took, refuge, in, basel, subsequently, farel, received, an, invitation, to, lead, the, church, in, neuch, tel, calvin, was, invited, to, lead, a, church, of, french, refugees, in, strasbourg, by, that, city, s, leading, reformers, martin, bucer, and, wolfgang, capito, initially, calvin, refused, because, farel, was, not, included, in, the, invitation, but, relented, when, bucer, appealed, to, him, by, september, 1538, calvin, had, taken, up, his, new, position, in, strasbourg, fully, expecting, that, this, time, it, would, be, permanent, a, few, months, later, he, applied, for, and, was, granted, citizenship, of, the, city, during, his, time, in, strasbourg, calvin, was, not, attached, to, one, particular, church, but, held, his, office, successively, in, the, saint, nicolas, church, the, sainte, madeleine, church, and, the, former, dominican, church, renamed, the, temple, neuf, all, of, these, churches, still, exist, but, none, are, in, the, architectural, state, of, calvin, s, days, calvin, ministered, to, 400, 500, members, in, his, church, he, preached, or, lectured, every, day, with, two, sermons, on, sunday, communion, was, celebrated, monthly, and, congregational, singing, of, the, psalms, was, encouraged, he, also, worked, on, the, second, edition, of, the, institutes, calvin, was, dissatisfied, with, its, original, structure, as, a, catechism, a, primer, for, young, christians, for, the, second, edition, published, in, 1539, calvin, changed, its, format, in, favor, of, systematically, presenting, the, main, doctrines, from, the, bible, in, the, process, the, book, was, enlarged, from, six, chapters, to, seventeen, he, concurrently, worked, on, another, book, the, commentary, on, romans, which, was, published, in, march, 1540, the, book, was, a, model, for, his, later, commentaries, it, included, his, own, latin, translation, from, the, greek, rather, than, the, latin, vulgate, an, exegesis, and, an, exposition, in, the, dedicatory, letter, calvin, praised, the, work, of, his, predecessors, philipp, melanchthon, heinrich, bullinger, and, martin, bucer, but, he, also, took, care, to, distinguish, his, own, work, from, theirs, and, to, criticize, some, of, their, shortcomings, calvin, s, friends, urged, him, to, marry, calvin, took, a, prosaic, view, writing, to, one, correspondent, i, who, have, the, air, of, being, so, hostile, to, celibacy, i, am, still, not, married, and, do, not, know, whether, i, will, ever, be, if, i, take, a, wife, it, will, be, because, being, better, freed, from, numerous, worries, i, can, devote, myself, to, the, lord, several, candidates, were, presented, to, him, including, one, young, woman, from, a, noble, family, reluctantly, calvin, agreed, to, the, marriage, on, the, condition, that, she, would, learn, french, although, a, wedding, date, was, planned, for, march, 1540, he, remained, reluctant, and, the, wedding, never, took, place, he, later, wrote, that, he, would, never, think, of, marrying, her, unless, the, lord, had, entirely, bereft, me, of, my, wits, instead, in, august, of, that, year, he, married, idelette, de, bure, a, widow, who, had, two, children, from, her, first, marriage, geneva, reconsidered, its, expulsion, of, calvin, church, attendance, had, dwindled, and, the, political, climate, had, changed, as, bern, and, geneva, quarreled, over, land, their, alliance, frayed, when, cardinal, jacopo, sadoleto, wrote, a, letter, to, the, city, council, inviting, geneva, to, return, to, the, catholic, faith, the, council, searched, for, an, ecclesiastical, authority, to, respond, to, him, at, first, pierre, viret, was, consulted, but, when, he, refused, the, council, asked, calvin, he, agreed, and, his, responsio, ad, sadoletum, letter, to, sadoleto, strongly, defended, geneva, s, position, concerning, reforms, in, the, church, on, 21, september, 1540, the, council, commissioned, one, of, its, members, ami, perrin, to, find, a, way, to, recall, calvin, an, embassy, reached, calvin, while, he, was, at, a, colloquy, a, conference, to, settle, religious, disputes, in, worms, his, reaction, to, the, suggestion, was, one, of, horror, in, which, he, wrote, rather, would, i, submit, to, death, a, hundred, times, than, to, that, cross, on, which, i, had, to, perish, daily, a, thousand, times, over, calvin, also, wrote, that, he, was, prepared, to, follow, the, lord, s, calling, a, plan, was, drawn, up, in, which, viret, would, be, appointed, to, take, temporary, charge, in, geneva, for, six, months, while, bucer, and, calvin, would, visit, the, city, to, determine, the, next, steps, the, city, council, pressed, for, the, immediate, appointment, of, calvin, in, geneva, by, mid, 1541, strasbourg, decided, to, lend, calvin, to, geneva, for, six, months, calvin, returned, on, 13, september, 1541, with, an, official, escort, and, a, wagon, for, his, family, in, supporting, calvin, s, proposals, for, reforms, the, council, of, geneva, passed, the, ordonnances, eccl, siastiques, ecclesiastical, ordinances, on, 20, november, 1541, the, ordinances, defined, four, orders, of, ministerial, function, pastors, to, preach, and, to, administer, the, sacraments, doctors, to, instruct, believers, in, the, faith, elders, to, provide, discipline, and, deacons, to, care, for, the, poor, and, needy, they, also, called, for, the, creation, of, the, consistoire, consistory, an, ecclesiastical, court, composed, of, the, elders, and, the, ministers, the, city, government, retained, the, power, to, summon, persons, before, the, court, and, the, consistory, could, judge, only, ecclesiastical, matters, having, no, civil, jurisdiction, originally, the, court, had, the, power, to, mete, out, sentences, with, excommunication, as, its, most, severe, penalty, the, government, contested, this, power, and, on, 19, march, 1543, the, council, decided, that, all, sentencing, would, be, carried, out, by, the, government, in, 1542, calvin, adapted, a, service, book, used, in, strasbourg, publishing, la, forme, des, pri, res, et, chants, eccl, siastiques, the, form, of, prayers, and, church, hymns, calvin, recognized, the, power, of, music, and, he, intended, that, it, be, used, to, support, scripture, readings, the, original, strasbourg, psalter, contained, twelve, psalms, by, cl, ment, marot, and, calvin, added, several, more, hymns, of, his, own, composition, in, the, geneva, version, at, the, end, of, 1542, marot, became, a, refugee, in, geneva, and, contributed, nineteen, more, psalms, louis, bourgeois, also, a, refugee, lived, and, taught, music, in, geneva, for, sixteen, years, and, calvin, took, the, opportunity, to, add, his, hymns, the, most, famous, being, the, old, hundredth, in, the, same, year, of, 1542, calvin, published, cat, chisme, de, l, eglise, de, gen, ve, catechism, of, the, church, of, geneva, which, was, inspired, by, bucer, s, kurze, schrifftliche, erkl, rung, of, 1534, calvin, had, written, an, earlier, catechism, during, his, first, stay, in, geneva, which, was, largely, based, on, martin, luther, s, large, catechism, the, first, version, was, arranged, pedagogically, describing, law, faith, and, prayer, the, 1542, version, was, rearranged, for, theological, reasons, covering, faith, first, then, law, and, prayer, historians, debate, the, extent, to, which, geneva, was, a, theocracy, on, the, one, hand, calvin, s, theology, clearly, called, for, separation, between, church, and, state, other, historians, have, stressed, the, enormous, political, power, wielded, on, a, daily, basis, by, the, clerics, during, his, ministry, in, geneva, calvin, preached, over, two, thousand, sermons, initially, he, preached, twice, on, sunday, and, three, times, during, the, week, this, proved, to, be, too, heavy, a, burden, and, late, in, 1542, the, council, allowed, him, to, preach, only, once, on, sunday, in, october, 1549, he, was, again, required, to, preach, twice, on, sundays, and, in, addition, every, weekday, of, alternate, weeks, his, sermons, lasted, more, than, an, hour, and, he, did, not, use, notes, an, occasional, secretary, tried, to, record, his, sermons, but, very, little, of, his, preaching, was, preserved, before, 1549, in, that, year, professional, scribe, denis, raguenier, who, had, learned, or, developed, a, system, of, shorthand, was, assigned, to, record, all, of, calvin, s, sermons, an, analysis, of, his, sermons, by, t, h, l, parker, suggests, that, calvin, was, a, consistent, preacher, and, his, style, changed, very, little, over, the, years, john, calvin, was, also, known, for, his, thorough, manner, of, working, his, way, through, the, bible, in, consecutive, sermons, from, march, 1555, to, july, 1556, calvin, delivered, two, hundred, sermons, on, deuteronomy, voltaire, wrote, about, calvin, luther, and, zwingli, if, they, condemned, celibacy, in, the, priests, and, opened, the, gates, of, the, convents, it, was, only, to, turn, all, society, into, a, convent, shows, and, entertainments, were, expressly, forbidden, by, their, religion, and, for, more, than, two, hundred, years, there, was, not, a, single, musical, instrument, allowed, in, the, city, of, geneva, they, condemned, auricular, confession, but, they, enjoined, a, public, one, and, in, switzerland, scotland, and, geneva, it, was, performed, the, same, as, penance, very, little, is, known, about, calvin, s, personal, life, in, geneva, his, house, and, furniture, were, owned, by, the, council, the, house, was, big, enough, to, accommodate, his, family, as, well, as, antoine, s, family, and, some, servants, on, 28, july, 1542, idelette, gave, birth, to, a, son, jacques, but, he, was, born, prematurely, and, survived, only, briefly, idelette, fell, ill, in, 1545, and, died, on, 29, march, 1549, calvin, never, married, again, he, expressed, his, sorrow, in, a, letter, to, viret, i, have, been, bereaved, of, the, best, friend, of, my, life, of, one, who, if, it, has, been, so, ordained, would, willingly, have, shared, not, only, my, poverty, but, also, my, death, during, her, life, she, was, the, faithful, helper, of, my, ministry, from, her, i, never, experienced, the, slightest, hindrance, throughout, the, rest, of, his, life, in, geneva, he, maintained, several, friendships, from, his, early, years, including, montmor, cordier, cop, farel, melanchthon, and, bullinger, calvin, encountered, bitter, opposition, to, his, work, in, geneva, around, 1546, the, uncoordinated, forces, coalesced, into, an, identifiable, group, whom, he, referred, to, as, the, libertines, but, who, preferred, to, be, called, either, spirituels, or, patriots, according, to, calvin, these, were, people, who, felt, that, after, being, liberated, through, grace, they, were, exempted, from, both, ecclesiastical, and, civil, law, the, group, consisted, of, wealthy, politically, powerful, and, interrelated, families, of, geneva, at, the, end, of, january, 1546, pierre, ameaux, a, maker, of, playing, cards, who, had, already, been, in, conflict, with, the, consistory, attacked, calvin, by, calling, him, a, picard, an, epithet, denoting, anti, french, sentiment, and, accused, him, of, false, doctrine, ameaux, was, punished, by, the, council, and, forced, to, make, expiation, by, parading, through, the, city, and, begging, god, for, forgiveness, a, few, months, later, ami, perrin, the, man, who, had, brought, calvin, to, geneva, moved, into, open, opposition, perrin, had, married, fran, oise, favre, daughter, of, fran, ois, favre, a, well, established, genevan, merchant, both, perrin, s, wife, and, father, in, law, had, previous, conflicts, with, the, consistory, the, court, noted, that, many, of, geneva, s, notables, including, perrin, had, breached, a, law, against, dancing, initially, perrin, ignored, the, court, when, he, was, summoned, but, after, receiving, a, letter, from, calvin, he, appeared, before, the, consistory, by, 1547, opposition, to, calvin, and, other, french, refugee, ministers, had, grown, to, constitute, the, majority, of, the, syndics, the, civil, magistrates, of, geneva, on, 27, june, an, unsigned, threatening, letter, in, genevan, dialect, was, found, at, the, pulpit, of, st, pierre, cathedral, where, calvin, preached, suspecting, a, plot, against, both, the, church, and, the, state, the, council, appointed, a, commission, to, investigate, jacques, gruet, a, genevan, member, of, favre, s, group, was, arrested, and, incriminating, evidence, was, found, when, his, house, was, searched, under, torture, he, confessed, to, several, crimes, including, writing, the, letter, left, in, the, pulpit, which, threatened, the, church, leaders, a, civil, court, condemned, gruet, to, death, and, he, was, beheaded, on, 26, july, calvin, was, not, opposed, to, the, civil, court, s, decision, the, libertines, continued, organizing, opposition, insulting, the, appointed, ministers, and, challenging, the, authority, of, the, consistory, the, council, straddled, both, sides, of, the, conflict, alternately, admonishing, and, upholding, calvin, when, perrin, was, elected, first, syndic, in, february, 1552, calvin, s, authority, appeared, to, be, at, its, lowest, point, after, some, losses, before, the, council, calvin, believed, he, was, defeated, on, 24, july, 1553, he, asked, the, council, to, allow, him, to, resign, although, the, libertines, controlled, the, council, his, request, was, refused, the, opposition, realized, that, they, could, curb, calvin, s, authority, but, they, did, not, have, enough, power, to, banish, him, the, turning, point, in, calvin, s, fortunes, occurred, when, michael, servetus, a, brilliant, spanish, polymath, who, introduced, the, islamic, idea, of, pulmonary, circulation, to, europe, and, a, fugitive, from, ecclesiastical, authorities, appeared, in, geneva, on, 13, august, 1553, servetus, was, a, fugitive, on, the, run, after, he, published, the, restoration, of, christianity, 1553, calvin, scholar, bruce, gordon, commented, among, its, offenses, were, a, denial, of, original, sin, and, a, bizarre, and, hardly, comprehensible, view, of, the, trinity, decades, earlier, in, july, 1530, he, disputed, with, johannes, oecolampadius, in, basel, and, was, eventually, expelled, he, went, to, strasbourg, where, he, published, a, pamphlet, against, the, trinity, bucer, publicly, refuted, it, and, asked, servetus, to, leave, after, returning, to, basel, servetus, published, two, books, of, dialogues, on, the, trinity, latin, dialogorum, de, trinitate, libri, duo, which, caused, a, sensation, among, reformers, and, catholics, alike, when, john, calvin, alerted, the, inquisition, in, spain, about, this, publication, an, order, was, issued, for, servetus, s, arrest, calvin, and, servetus, were, first, brought, into, contact, in, 1546, through, a, common, acquaintance, jean, frellon, of, lyon, they, exchanged, letters, debating, doctrine, calvin, used, a, pseudonym, as, charles, d, espeville, and, servetus, used, the, moniker, michel, de, villeneuve, eventually, calvin, lost, patience, and, refused, to, respond, by, this, time, servetus, had, written, around, thirty, letters, to, calvin, calvin, was, particularly, outraged, when, servetus, sent, him, a, copy, of, the, institutes, of, the, christian, religion, heavily, annotated, with, arguments, pointing, to, errors, in, the, book, when, servetus, mentioned, that, he, would, come, to, geneva, espeville, calvin, wrote, a, letter, to, farel, on, 13, february, 1546, noting, that, if, servetus, were, to, come, he, would, not, assure, him, safe, conduct, for, if, he, came, as, far, as, my, authority, goes, i, would, not, let, him, leave, alive, in, 1553, servetus, published, christianismi, restitutio, english, the, restoration, of, christianity, in, which, he, rejected, the, christian, doctrine, of, the, trinity, and, the, concept, of, predestination, in, the, same, year, calvin, s, representative, guillaume, de, trie, sent, letters, alerting, the, french, inquisition, to, servetus, calling, him, a, spanish, portuguese, suspecting, and, accusing, him, of, his, recently, proved, jewish, converso, origin, de, trie, wrote, down, that, his, proper, name, is, michael, servetus, but, he, currently, calls, himself, villeneuve, practicing, medicine, he, stayed, for, some, time, in, lyon, and, now, he, is, living, in, vienne, when, the, inquisitor, general, of, france, learned, that, servetus, was, hiding, in, vienne, according, to, calvin, under, an, assumed, name, he, contacted, cardinal, fran, ois, de, tournon, the, secretary, of, the, archbishop, of, lyon, to, take, up, the, matter, servetus, was, arrested, and, taken, in, for, questioning, his, letters, to, calvin, were, presented, as, evidence, of, heresy, but, he, denied, having, written, them, and, later, said, he, was, not, sure, it, was, his, handwriting, he, said, after, swearing, before, the, holy, gospel, that, he, was, michel, de, villeneuve, doctor, in, medicine, about, 42, years, old, native, of, tudela, of, the, kingdom, of, navarre, a, city, under, the, obedience, to, the, emperor, the, following, day, he, said, although, he, was, not, servetus, he, assumed, the, person, of, servet, for, debating, with, calvin, he, managed, to, escape, from, prison, and, the, catholic, authorities, sentenced, him, in, absentia, to, death, by, slow, burning, on, his, way, to, italy, servetus, stopped, in, geneva, to, visit, d, espeville, where, he, was, recognized, and, arrested, calvin, s, secretary, nicholas, de, la, fontaine, composed, a, list, of, accusations, that, was, submitted, before, the, court, the, prosecutor, was, philibert, berthelier, a, member, of, a, libertine, family, and, son, of, a, famous, geneva, patriot, and, the, sessions, were, led, by, pierre, tissot, perrin, s, brother, in, law, the, libertines, allowed, the, trial, to, drag, on, in, an, attempt, to, harass, calvin, the, difficulty, in, using, servetus, as, a, weapon, against, calvin, was, that, the, heretical, reputation, of, servetus, was, widespread, and, most, of, the, cities, in, europe, were, observing, and, awaiting, the, outcome, of, the, trial, this, posed, a, dilemma, for, the, libertines, so, on, 21, august, the, council, decided, to, write, to, other, swiss, cities, for, their, opinions, thus, mitigating, their, own, responsibility, for, the, final, decision, while, waiting, for, the, responses, the, council, also, asked, servetus, if, he, preferred, to, be, judged, in, vienne, or, in, geneva, he, begged, to, stay, in, geneva, on, 20, october, the, replies, from, zurich, basel, bern, and, schaffhausen, were, read, and, the, council, condemned, servetus, as, a, heretic, the, following, day, he, was, sentenced, to, burning, at, the, stake, the, same, sentence, as, in, vienne, some, scholars, claim, that, calvin, and, other, ministers, asked, that, he, be, beheaded, instead, of, burnt, knowing, that, burning, at, the, stake, was, the, only, legal, recourse, this, plea, was, refused, and, on, 27, october, servetus, was, burnt, alive, at, the, plateau, of, champel, at, the, edge, of, geneva, after, the, death, of, servetus, calvin, was, acclaimed, a, defender, of, christianity, but, his, ultimate, triumph, over, the, libertines, was, still, two, years, away, he, had, always, insisted, that, the, consistory, retain, the, power, of, excommunication, despite, the, council, s, past, decision, to, take, it, away, during, servetus, s, trial, philibert, berthelier, asked, the, council, for, permission, to, take, communion, as, he, had, been, excommunicated, the, previous, year, for, insulting, a, minister, calvin, protested, that, the, council, did, not, have, the, legal, authority, to, overturn, berthelier, s, excommunication, unsure, of, how, the, council, would, rule, he, hinted, in, a, sermon, on, 3, september, 1553, that, he, might, be, dismissed, by, the, authorities, the, council, decided, to, re, examine, the, ordonnances, and, on, 18, september, it, voted, in, support, of, calvin, excommunication, was, within, the, jurisdiction, of, the, consistory, berthelier, applied, for, reinstatement, to, another, genevan, administrative, assembly, the, deux, cents, two, hundred, in, november, this, body, reversed, the, council, s, decision, and, stated, that, the, final, arbiter, concerning, excommunication, should, be, the, council, the, ministers, continued, to, protest, and, as, in, the, case, of, servetus, the, opinions, of, the, swiss, churches, were, sought, the, affair, dragged, on, through, 1554, finally, on, 22, january, 1555, the, council, announced, the, decision, of, the, swiss, churches, the, original, ordonnances, were, to, be, kept, and, the, consistory, was, to, regain, its, official, powers, the, libertines, downfall, began, with, the, february, 1555, elections, by, then, many, of, the, french, refugees, had, been, granted, citizenship, and, with, their, support, calvin, s, partisans, elected, the, majority, of, the, syndics, and, the, councilors, on, 16, may, the, libertines, took, to, the, streets, in, a, drunken, protest, and, attempted, to, burn, down, a, house, that, was, supposedly, full, of, frenchmen, the, syndic, henri, aulbert, tried, to, intervene, carrying, with, him, the, baton, of, office, that, symbolized, his, power, perrin, seized, the, baton, and, waved, it, over, the, crowd, which, gave, the, appearance, that, he, was, taking, power, and, initiating, a, coup, d, tat, the, insurrection, was, soon, over, when, another, syndic, appeared, and, ordered, perrin, to, go, with, him, to, the, town, hall, perrin, and, other, leaders, were, forced, to, flee, the, city, with, the, approval, of, calvin, the, other, plotters, who, remained, in, the, city, were, found, and, executed, the, opposition, to, calvin, s, church, polity, came, to, an, end, calvin, s, authority, was, practically, uncontested, during, his, final, years, and, he, enjoyed, an, international, reputation, as, a, reformer, distinct, from, martin, luther, initially, luther, and, calvin, had, mutual, respect, for, each, other, a, doctrinal, conflict, had, developed, between, luther, and, zurich, reformer, huldrych, zwingli, on, the, interpretation, of, the, eucharist, calvin, s, opinion, on, the, issue, forced, luther, to, place, him, in, zwingli, s, camp, calvin, actively, participated, in, the, polemics, that, were, exchanged, between, the, lutheran, and, reformed, branches, of, the, reformation, movement, at, the, same, time, calvin, was, dismayed, by, the, lack, of, unity, among, the, reformers, he, took, steps, toward, rapprochement, with, bullinger, by, signing, the, consensus, tigurinus, a, concordat, between, the, zurich, and, geneva, churches, he, reached, out, to, england, when, archbishop, of, canterbury, thomas, cranmer, called, for, an, ecumenical, synod, of, all, the, evangelical, churches, calvin, praised, the, idea, but, ultimately, cranmer, was, unable, to, bring, it, to, fruition, calvin, sheltered, marian, exiles, those, who, fled, the, reign, of, catholic, mary, tudor, in, england, in, geneva, starting, in, 1555, under, the, city, s, protection, they, were, able, to, form, their, own, reformed, church, under, john, knox, and, william, whittingham, and, eventually, carried, calvin, s, ideas, on, doctrine, and, polity, back, to, england, and, scotland, within, geneva, calvin, s, main, concern, was, the, creation, of, a, coll, ge, an, institute, for, the, education, of, children, a, site, for, the, school, was, selected, on, 25, march, 1558, and, it, opened, the, following, year, on, 5, june, 1559, although, the, school, was, a, single, institution, it, was, divided, into, two, parts, a, grammar, school, called, the, coll, ge, or, schola, privata, and, an, advanced, school, called, the, acad, mie, or, schola, publica, calvin, tried, to, recruit, two, professors, for, the, institute, mathurin, cordier, his, old, friend, and, latin, scholar, who, was, now, based, in, lausanne, and, emmanuel, tremellius, the, former, regius, professor, of, hebrew, in, cambridge, neither, was, available, but, he, succeeded, in, obtaining, theodore, beza, as, rector, within, five, years, there, were, 1, 200, students, in, the, grammar, school, and, 300, in, the, advanced, school, the, coll, ge, eventually, became, the, coll, ge, calvin, one, of, the, college, preparatory, schools, of, geneva, the, acad, mie, became, the, university, of, geneva, calvin, was, deeply, committed, to, reforming, his, homeland, france, the, protestant, movement, had, been, energetic, but, lacked, central, organizational, direction, with, financial, support, from, the, church, in, geneva, calvin, turned, his, enormous, energies, toward, uplifting, the, french, protestant, cause, as, one, historian, explains, he, supplied, the, dogma, the, liturgy, and, the, moral, ideas, of, the, new, religion, and, he, also, created, ecclesiastical, political, and, social, institutions, in, harmony, with, it, a, born, leader, he, followed, up, his, work, with, personal, appeals, his, vast, correspondence, with, french, protestants, shows, not, only, much, zeal, but, infinite, pains, and, considerable, tact, and, driving, home, the, lessons, of, his, printed, treatises, between, 1555, and, 1562, more, than, 100, ministers, were, sent, to, france, nevertheless, french, king, henry, ii, severely, persecuted, protestants, under, the, edict, of, chateaubriand, and, when, the, french, authorities, complained, about, the, missionary, activities, the, city, fathers, of, geneva, disclaimed, official, responsibility, in, late, 1558, calvin, became, ill, with, a, fever, since, he, was, afraid, that, he, might, die, before, completing, the, final, revision, of, the, institutes, he, forced, himself, to, work, the, final, edition, was, greatly, expanded, to, the, extent, that, calvin, referred, to, it, as, a, new, work, the, expansion, from, the, 21, chapters, of, the, previous, edition, to, 80, was, due, to, the, extended, treatment, of, existing, material, rather, than, the, addition, of, new, topics, shortly, after, he, recovered, he, strained, his, voice, while, preaching, which, brought, on, a, violent, fit, of, coughing, he, burst, a, blood, vessel, in, his, lungs, and, his, health, steadily, declined, he, preached, his, final, sermon, in, st, pierre, on, 6, february, 1564, on, 25, april, he, made, his, will, in, which, he, left, small, sums, to, his, family, and, to, the, coll, ge, a, few, days, later, the, ministers, of, the, church, came, to, visit, him, and, he, bade, his, final, farewell, which, was, recorded, in, discours, d, adieu, aux, ministres, he, recounted, his, life, in, geneva, sometimes, recalling, bitterly, some, of, the, hardships, he, had, suffered, calvin, died, on, 27, may, 1564, aged, 54, at, first, his, body, lay, in, state, but, since, so, many, people, came, to, see, it, the, reformers, were, afraid, that, they, would, be, accused, of, fostering, a, new, saint, s, cult, on, the, following, day, he, was, buried, in, an, unmarked, grave, in, the, cimeti, re, des, rois, the, exact, location, of, the, grave, is, unknown, a, stone, was, added, in, the, 19th, century, to, mark, a, grave, traditionally, thought, to, be, calvin, s, calvin, developed, his, theology, in, his, biblical, commentaries, as, well, as, his, sermons, and, treatises, but, the, most, comprehensive, expression, of, his, views, is, found, in, his, magnum, opus, the, institutes, of, the, christian, religion, he, intended, that, the, book, be, used, as, a, summary, of, his, views, on, christian, theology, and, that, it, be, read, in, conjunction, with, his, commentaries, the, various, editions, of, that, work, spanned, nearly, his, entire, career, as, a, reformer, and, the, successive, revisions, of, the, book, show, that, his, theology, changed, very, little, from, his, youth, to, his, death, the, first, edition, from, 1536, consisted, of, only, six, chapters, the, second, edition, published, in, 1539, was, three, times, as, long, because, he, added, chapters, on, subjects, that, appear, in, melanchthon, s, loci, communes, in, 1543, he, again, added, new, material, and, expanded, a, chapter, on, the, apostles, creed, the, final, edition, of, the, institutes, appeared, in, 1559, by, then, the, work, consisted, of, four, books, of, eighty, chapters, and, each, book, was, named, after, statements, from, the, creed, book, 1, on, god, the, creator, book, 2, on, the, redeemer, in, christ, book, 3, on, receiving, the, grace, of, christ, through, the, holy, spirit, and, book, 4, on, the, society, of, christ, or, the, church, the, first, statement, in, the, institutes, acknowledges, its, central, theme, it, states, that, the, sum, of, human, wisdom, consists, of, two, parts, the, knowledge, of, god, and, of, ourselves, calvin, argues, that, the, knowledge, of, god, is, not, inherent, in, humanity, nor, can, it, be, discovered, by, observing, this, world, the, only, way, to, obtain, it, is, to, study, scripture, calvin, writes, for, anyone, to, arrive, at, god, the, creator, he, needs, scripture, as, his, guide, and, teacher, he, does, not, try, to, prove, the, authority, of, scripture, but, rather, describes, it, as, autopiston, or, self, authenticating, he, defends, the, trinitarian, view, of, god, and, in, a, strong, polemical, stand, against, the, catholic, church, argues, that, images, of, god, lead, to, idolatry, john, calvin, famously, said, the, human, heart, is, a, perpetual, idol, factory, at, the, end, of, the, first, book, he, offers, his, views, on, providence, writing, by, his, power, god, cherishes, and, guards, the, world, which, he, made, and, by, his, providence, rules, its, individual, parts, humans, are, unable, to, fully, comprehend, why, god, performs, any, particular, action, but, whatever, good, or, evil, people, may, practice, their, efforts, always, result, in, the, execution, of, god, s, will, and, judgments, the, second, book, includes, several, essays, on, original, sin, and, the, fall, of, man, which, directly, refer, to, augustine, who, developed, these, doctrines, he, often, cited, the, church, fathers, to, defend, the, reformed, cause, against, the, charge, that, the, reformers, were, creating, new, theology, in, calvin, s, view, sin, began, with, the, fall, of, adam, and, propagated, to, all, of, humanity, the, domination, of, sin, is, complete, to, the, point, that, people, are, driven, to, evil, thus, fallen, humanity, is, in, need, of, the, redemption, that, can, be, found, in, christ, but, before, calvin, expounded, on, this, doctrine, he, described, the, special, situation, of, the, jews, who, lived, during, the, time, of, the, old, testament, god, made, a, covenant, with, abraham, promising, the, coming, of, christ, hence, the, old, covenant, was, not, in, opposition, to, christ, but, was, rather, a, continuation, of, god, s, promise, calvin, then, describes, the, new, covenant, using, the, passage, from, the, apostles, creed, that, describes, christ, s, suffering, under, pontius, pilate, and, his, return, to, judge, the, living, and, the, dead, for, calvin, the, whole, course, of, christ, s, obedience, to, the, father, removed, the, discord, between, humanity, and, god, in, the, third, book, calvin, describes, how, the, spiritual, union, of, christ, and, humanity, is, achieved, he, first, defines, faith, as, the, firm, and, certain, knowledge, of, god, in, christ, the, immediate, effects, of, faith, are, repentance, and, the, remission, of, sin, this, is, followed, by, spiritual, regeneration, which, returns, the, believer, to, the, state, of, holiness, before, adam, s, transgression, complete, perfection, is, unattainable, in, this, life, and, the, believer, should, expect, a, continual, struggle, against, sin, several, chapters, are, then, devoted, to, the, subject, of, justification, by, faith, alone, he, defined, justification, as, the, acceptance, by, which, god, regards, us, as, righteous, whom, he, has, received, into, grace, in, this, definition, it, is, clear, that, it, is, god, who, initiates, and, carries, through, the, action, and, that, people, play, no, role, god, is, completely, sovereign, in, salvation, near, the, end, of, the, book, calvin, describes, and, defends, the, doctrine, of, predestination, a, doctrine, advanced, by, augustine, in, opposition, to, the, teachings, of, pelagius, fellow, theologians, who, followed, the, augustinian, tradition, on, this, point, included, thomas, aquinas, and, martin, luther, though, calvin, s, formulation, of, the, doctrine, went, further, than, the, tradition, that, went, before, him, the, principle, in, calvin, s, words, is, that, all, are, not, created, on, equal, terms, but, some, are, preordained, to, eternal, life, others, to, eternal, damnation, and, accordingly, as, each, has, been, created, for, one, or, other, of, these, ends, we, say, that, he, has, been, predestinated, to, life, or, to, death, calvin, believed, that, god, s, absolute, decree, was, double, predestination, but, he, also, confessed, that, this, was, a, horrible, decree, the, decree, is, dreadful, indeed, i, confess, latin, decretum, quidem, horribile, fateor, french, je, confesse, que, ce, decret, nous, doit, epouvanter, the, final, book, describes, what, he, considers, to, be, the, true, church, and, its, ministry, authority, and, sacraments, he, denied, the, papal, claim, to, primacy, and, the, accusation, that, the, reformers, were, schismatic, for, calvin, the, church, was, defined, as, the, body, of, believers, who, placed, christ, at, its, head, by, definition, there, was, only, one, catholic, or, universal, church, hence, he, argued, that, the, reformers, had, to, leave, them, in, order, that, we, might, come, to, christ, the, ministers, of, the, church, are, described, from, a, passage, from, ephesians, and, they, consisted, of, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and, doctors, calvin, regarded, the, first, three, offices, as, temporary, limited, in, their, existence, to, the, time, of, the, new, testament, the, latter, two, offices, were, established, in, the, church, in, geneva, although, calvin, respected, the, work, of, the, ecumenical, councils, he, considered, them, to, be, subject, to, god, s, word, found, in, scripture, he, also, believed, that, the, civil, and, church, authorities, were, separate, and, should, not, interfere, with, each, other, calvin, defined, a, sacrament, as, an, earthly, sign, associated, with, a, promise, from, god, he, accepted, only, two, sacraments, as, valid, under, the, new, covenant, baptism, and, the, lord, s, supper, in, opposition, to, the, catholic, acceptance, of, seven, sacraments, he, completely, rejected, the, catholic, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, and, the, treatment, of, the, supper, as, a, sacrifice, he, also, could, not, accept, the, lutheran, doctrine, of, sacramental, union, in, which, christ, was, in, with, and, under, the, elements, his, own, view, was, close, to, zwingli, s, symbolic, view, but, it, was, not, identical, rather, than, holding, a, purely, symbolic, view, calvin, noted, that, with, the, participation, of, the, holy, spirit, faith, was, nourished, and, strengthened, by, the, sacrament, in, his, words, the, eucharistic, rite, was, a, secret, too, sublime, for, my, mind, to, understand, or, words, to, express, i, experience, it, rather, than, understand, it, calvin, s, theology, caused, controversy, pierre, caroli, a, protestant, minister, in, lausanne, accused, calvin, as, well, as, viret, and, farel, of, arianism, in, 1536, calvin, defended, his, beliefs, on, the, trinity, in, confessio, de, trinitate, propter, calumnias, p, caroli, in, 1551, j, r, me, herm, s, bolsec, a, physician, in, geneva, attacked, calvin, s, doctrine, of, predestination, and, accused, him, of, making, god, the, author, of, sin, bolsec, was, banished, from, the, city, and, after, calvin, s, death, wrote, a, biography, which, severely, maligned, calvin, s, character, in, the, following, year, joachim, westphal, a, gnesio, lutheran, pastor, in, hamburg, condemned, calvin, and, zwingli, as, heretics, in, denying, the, eucharistic, doctrine, of, the, union, of, christ, s, body, with, the, elements, calvin, s, defensio, sanae, et, orthodoxae, doctrinae, de, sacramentis, a, defense, of, the, sober, and, orthodox, doctrine, of, the, sacrament, was, his, response, in, 1555, in, 1556, justus, velsius, a, dutch, dissident, held, a, public, disputation, with, calvin, during, his, visit, to, frankfurt, in, which, velsius, defended, free, will, against, calvin, s, doctrine, of, predestination, following, the, execution, of, servetus, a, close, associate, of, calvin, sebastian, castellio, broke, with, him, on, the, issue, of, the, treatment, of, heretics, in, castellio, s, treatise, on, heretics, 1554, he, argued, for, a, focus, on, christ, s, moral, teachings, in, place, of, the, vanity, of, theology, and, he, afterward, developed, a, theory, of, tolerance, based, on, biblical, principles, scholars, have, debated, calvin, s, view, of, the, jews, and, judaism, some, have, argued, that, calvin, was, the, least, antisemitic, among, all, the, major, reformers, of, his, time, especially, in, comparison, to, martin, luther, others, have, argued, that, calvin, was, firmly, within, the, antisemitic, camp, scholars, agree, that, it, is, important, to, distinguish, between, calvin, s, views, toward, the, biblical, jews, and, his, attitude, toward, contemporary, jews, in, his, theology, calvin, does, not, differentiate, between, god, s, covenant, with, israel, and, the, new, covenant, he, stated, all, the, children, of, the, promise, reborn, of, god, who, have, obeyed, the, commands, by, faith, working, through, love, have, belonged, to, the, new, covenant, since, the, world, began, nevertheless, he, was, a, covenant, theologian, and, argued, that, the, jews, are, a, rejected, people, who, must, embrace, jesus, to, re, enter, the, covenant, most, of, calvin, s, statements, on, the, jewry, of, his, era, were, polemical, for, example, calvin, once, wrote, i, have, had, much, conversation, with, many, jews, i, have, never, seen, either, a, drop, of, piety, or, a, grain, of, truth, or, ingenuousness, nay, i, have, never, found, common, sense, in, any, jew, in, this, respect, he, differed, little, from, other, protestant, and, catholic, theologians, of, his, day, among, his, extant, writings, calvin, dealt, explicitly, with, issues, of, contemporary, jews, and, judaism, in, only, one, treatise, response, to, questions, and, objections, of, a, certain, jew, in, it, he, argued, that, jews, misread, their, own, scriptures, because, they, miss, the, unity, of, the, old, and, new, testaments, the, aim, of, calvin, s, political, theory, was, to, safeguard, the, rights, and, freedoms, of, ordinary, people, although, he, was, convinced, that, the, bible, contained, no, blueprint, for, a, certain, form, of, government, calvin, favored, a, combination, of, democracy, and, aristocracy, mixed, government, he, appreciated, the, advantages, of, democracy, to, further, minimize, the, misuse, of, political, power, calvin, proposed, to, divide, it, among, several, political, institutions, like, the, aristocracy, lower, estates, or, magistrates, in, a, system, of, checks, and, balances, separation, of, powers, finally, calvin, taught, that, if, rulers, rise, up, against, god, they, lose, their, divine, right, and, must, be, deposed, state, and, church, are, separate, though, they, have, to, cooperate, to, the, benefit, of, the, people, christian, magistrates, have, to, make, sure, that, the, church, can, fulfill, its, duties, in, freedom, in, extreme, cases, the, magistrates, have, to, expel, or, execute, dangerous, heretics, but, nobody, can, be, forced, to, become, a, protestant, calvin, thought, that, agriculture, and, the, traditional, crafts, were, normal, human, activities, with, regard, to, trade, and, the, financial, world, he, was, more, liberal, than, luther, but, both, were, strictly, opposed, to, usury, calvin, allowed, the, charging, of, modest, interest, rates, on, loans, like, the, other, reformers, calvin, understood, work, as, a, means, through, which, the, believers, expressed, their, gratitude, to, god, for, their, redemption, in, christ, and, as, a, service, to, their, neighbors, everybody, was, obliged, to, work, loafing, and, begging, were, rejected, the, idea, that, economic, success, was, a, visible, sign, of, god, s, grace, played, only, a, minor, role, in, calvin, s, thinking, it, became, more, important, in, later, partly, secularized, forms, of, calvinism, and, became, the, starting, point, of, max, weber, s, theory, about, the, rise, of, capitalism, calvin, s, first, published, work, was, a, commentary, of, seneca, the, younger, s, de, clementia, published, at, his, own, expense, in, 1532, it, showed, that, he, was, a, humanist, in, the, tradition, of, erasmus, with, a, thorough, understanding, of, classical, scholarship, his, first, theological, work, the, psychopannychia, attempted, to, refute, the, doctrine, of, soul, sleep, as, promulgated, by, the, anabaptists, calvin, probably, wrote, it, during, the, period, following, cop, s, speech, but, it, was, not, published, until, 1542, in, strasbourg, calvin, produced, commentaries, on, most, of, the, books, of, the, bible, his, first, commentary, on, romans, was, published, in, 1540, and, he, planned, to, write, commentaries, on, the, entire, new, testament, six, years, passed, before, he, wrote, his, second, a, commentary, on, first, epistle, to, the, corinthians, but, after, that, he, devoted, more, attention, to, reaching, his, goal, within, four, years, he, had, published, commentaries, on, all, the, pauline, epistles, and, he, also, revised, the, commentary, on, romans, he, then, turned, his, attention, to, the, general, epistles, dedicating, them, to, edward, vi, of, england, by, 1555, he, had, completed, his, work, on, the, new, testament, finishing, with, the, acts, and, the, gospels, he, omitted, only, the, brief, second, and, third, epistles, of, john, and, the, book, of, revelation, for, the, old, testament, he, wrote, commentaries, on, isaiah, the, books, of, the, pentateuch, the, psalms, and, joshua, the, material, for, the, commentaries, often, originated, from, lectures, to, students, and, ministers, that, he, reworked, for, publication, from, 1557, onwards, he, could, not, find, the, time, to, continue, this, method, and, he, gave, permission, for, his, lectures, to, be, published, from, stenographers, notes, these, praelectiones, covered, the, minor, prophets, daniel, jeremiah, lamentations, and, part, of, ezekiel, calvin, also, wrote, many, letters, and, treatises, following, the, responsio, ad, sadoletum, calvin, wrote, an, open, letter, at, the, request, of, bucer, to, charles, v, in, 1543, supplex, exhortatio, ad, caesarem, defending, the, reformed, faith, this, was, followed, by, an, open, letter, to, the, pope, admonitio, paterna, pauli, iii, in, 1544, in, which, calvin, admonished, paul, iii, for, depriving, the, reformers, of, any, prospect, of, rapprochement, the, pope, proceeded, to, open, the, council, of, trent, which, resulted, in, decrees, against, the, reformers, calvin, refuted, the, decrees, by, producing, the, acta, synodi, tridentinae, cum, antidoto, the, synod, of, trent, with, antidote, in, 1547, when, charles, tried, to, find, a, compromise, solution, with, the, augsburg, interim, bucer, and, bullinger, urged, calvin, to, respond, he, wrote, the, treatise, vera, christianae, pacificationis, et, ecclesiae, reformandae, ratio, the, true, system, of, christian, pacification, and, the, reformation, of, the, church, in, 1549, in, which, he, described, the, doctrines, that, should, be, upheld, including, justification, by, faith, calvin, provided, many, of, the, foundational, documents, for, reformed, churches, including, documents, on, the, catechism, the, liturgy, and, church, governance, he, also, produced, several, confessions, of, faith, to, unite, the, churches, in, 1559, he, drafted, the, french, confession, of, faith, the, gallic, confession, and, the, synod, in, paris, accepted, it, with, few, changes, the, belgic, confession, of, 1561, a, dutch, confession, of, faith, was, partly, based, on, the, gallic, confession, after, the, deaths, of, calvin, and, his, successor, beza, the, geneva, city, council, gradually, gained, control, over, areas, of, life, that, were, previously, in, the, ecclesiastical, domain, increasing, secularization, was, accompanied, by, the, decline, of, the, church, even, the, geneva, acad, mie, was, eclipsed, by, universities, in, leiden, and, heidelberg, which, became, the, new, strongholds, of, calvin, s, ideas, first, identified, as, calvinism, by, joachim, westphal, in, 1552, by, 1585, geneva, once, the, wellspring, of, the, reform, movement, had, become, merely, its, symbol, calvin, had, always, warned, against, describing, him, as, an, idol, and, geneva, as, a, new, jerusalem, he, encouraged, people, to, adapt, to, the, environments, in, which, they, found, themselves, even, during, his, polemical, exchange, with, westphal, he, advised, a, group, of, french, speaking, refugees, who, had, settled, in, wesel, germany, to, integrate, with, the, local, lutheran, churches, despite, his, differences, with, the, lutherans, he, did, not, deny, that, they, were, members, of, the, true, church, calvin, s, recognition, of, the, need, to, adapt, to, local, conditions, became, an, important, characteristic, of, the, reformation, movement, as, it, spread, across, europe, due, to, calvin, s, missionary, work, in, france, his, program, of, reform, eventually, reached, the, french, speaking, provinces, of, the, netherlands, calvinism, was, adopted, in, the, electorate, of, the, palatinate, under, frederick, iii, which, led, to, the, formulation, of, the, heidelberg, catechism, in, 1563, this, and, the, belgic, confession, were, adopted, as, confessional, standards, in, the, first, synod, of, the, dutch, reformed, church, in, 1571, several, leading, divines, either, calvinist, or, those, sympathetic, to, calvinism, settled, in, england, martin, bucer, peter, martyr, and, jan, laski, and, scotland, john, knox, during, the, english, civil, war, the, calvinistic, puritans, produced, the, westminster, confession, which, became, the, confessional, standard, for, presbyterians, in, the, english, speaking, world, as, the, ottoman, empire, did, not, force, muslim, conversion, on, its, conquered, western, territories, reformed, ideas, were, quickly, adopted, in, the, two, thirds, of, hungary, they, occupied, the, habsburg, ruled, third, part, of, hungary, remained, catholic, a, reformed, constitutional, synod, was, held, in, 1567, in, debrecen, the, main, hub, of, hungarian, calvinism, where, the, second, helvetic, confession, was, adopted, as, the, official, confession, of, hungarian, calvinists, having, established, itself, in, europe, the, movement, continued, to, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, world, including, north, america, south, africa, and, korea, calvin, did, not, live, to, see, the, foundation, of, his, work, grow, into, an, international, movement, but, his, death, allowed, his, ideas, to, break, out, of, their, city, of, origin, to, succeed, far, beyond, their, borders, and, to, establish, their, own, distinct, character, calvin, is, recognized, as, a, renewer, of, the, church, in, lutheran, churches, commemorated, on, 26, may, calvin, is, also, remembered, in, the, church, of, england, with, a,
