lives, and, a, recession, might, occur, his, repeated, use, of, chinese, virus, and, china, virus, to, describe, covid, 19, drew, criticism, from, health, experts, by, early, april, as, the, pandemic, worsened, and, amid, criticism, of, his, administration, s, response, trump, refused, to, admit, any, mistakes, in, his, handling, of, the, outbreak, instead, blaming, the, media, democratic, state, governors, the, previous, administration, china, and, the, who, the, daily, coronavirus, task, force, briefings, ended, in, late, april, after, a, briefing, at, which, trump, suggested, the, dangerous, idea, of, injecting, a, disinfectant, to, treat, covid, 19, the, comment, was, widely, condemned, by, medical, professionals, in, early, may, trump, proposed, the, phase, out, of, the, coronavirus, task, force, and, its, replacement, with, another, group, centered, on, reopening, the, economy, amid, a, backlash, trump, said, the, task, force, would, indefinitely, continue, by, the, end, of, may, the, coronavirus, task, force, s, meetings, were, sharply, reduced, prior, to, the, pandemic, trump, criticized, the, who, and, other, international, bodies, which, he, asserted, were, taking, advantage, of, u, s, aid, his, administration, s, proposed, 2021, federal, budget, released, in, february, proposed, reducing, who, funding, by, more, than, half, in, may, and, april, trump, accused, the, who, of, severely, mismanaging, covid, 19, alleged, without, evidence, that, the, organization, was, under, chinese, control, and, had, enabled, the, chinese, government, s, concealment, of, the, pandemic, s, origins, and, announced, that, he, was, withdrawing, funding, for, the, organization, these, were, seen, as, attempts, to, distract, from, his, own, mishandling, of, the, pandemic, in, july, 2020, trump, announced, the, formal, withdrawal, of, the, u, s, from, the, who, effective, july, 2021, the, decision, was, widely, condemned, by, health, and, government,

ending, the, restrictions, to, reverse, the, damage, to, the, country, s, economy, trump, often, refused, to, mask, at, public, events, contrary, to, his, administration, s, april, 2020, guidance, to, wear, masks, in, public, and, despite, nearly, unanimous, medical, consensus, that, masks, are, important, to, preventing, spread, of, the, virus, by, june, trump, had, said, masks, were, a, double, edged, sword, ridiculed, biden, for, wearing, masks, continually, emphasized, that, mask, wearing, was, optional, and, suggested, that, wearing, a, mask, was, a, political, statement, against, him, personally, trump, s, contradiction, of, medical, recommendations, weakened, national, efforts, to, mitigate, the, pandemic, in, june, and, july, trump, said, several, times, that, the, u, s, would, have, fewer, cases, of, coronavirus, if, it, did, less, testing, that, having, a, large, number, of, reported, cases, makes, us, look, bad, the, cdc, guideline, at, the, time, was, that, any, person, exposed, to, the, virus, should, be, quickly, identified, and, tested, even, if, they, are, not, showing, symptoms, because, asymptomatic, people, can, still, spread, the, virus, in, august, 2020, the, cdc, quietly, lowered, its, recommendation, for, testing, advising, that, people, who, have, been, exposed, to, the, virus, but, are, not, showing, symptoms, do, not, necessarily, need, a, test, the, change, in, guidelines, was, made, by, hhs, political, appointees, under, trump, administration, pressure, against, the, wishes, of, cdc, scientists, the, day, after, this, political, interference, was, reported, the, testing, guideline, was, changed, back, to, its, original, recommendation, despite, record, numbers, of, covid, 19, cases, in, the, u, s, from, mid, june, onward, and, an, increasing, percentage, of, positive, test, results, trump, largely, continued, to, downplay, the, pandemic, including, his, false, claim, in, early, july, 2020, that, 99, percent, of, covid, 19, cases, are, totally, harmless, he, began, insisting, that, all, states, should, resume, in, person, education, in, the, fall, despite, a, july, spike, in, reported, cases, trump, repeatedly, pressured, federal, health, agencies, to, take, actions, he, favored, such, as, approving, unproven, treatments, or, speeding, up, vaccine, approvals, trump, administration, political, appointees, at, hhs, sought, to, control, cdc, communications, to, the, public, that, undermined, trump, s, claims, that, the, pandemic, was, under, control, cdc, resisted, many, of, the, changes, but, increasingly, allowed, hhs, personnel, to, review, articles, and, suggest, changes, before, publication, trump, alleged, without, evidence, that, fda, scientists, were, part, of, a, deep, state, opposing, him, and, delaying, approval, of, vaccines, and, treatments, to, hurt, him, politically, on, october, 2, 2020, trump, tweeted, that, he, had, tested, positive, for, covid, 19, part, of, a, white, house,

the, central, issue, polls, suggested, voters, blamed, trump, for, his, pandemic, response, and, disbelieved, his, rhetoric, concerning, the, virus, with, an, ipsos, abc, news, poll, indicating, 65, percent, of, respondents, disapproved, of, his, pandemic, response, in, the, final, months, of, the, campaign, trump, repeatedly, said, that, the, u, s, was, rounding, the, turn, in, managing, the,

pressured, zelenskyy, to, investigate, crowdstrike, and, democratic, presidential, candidate, biden, and, his, son, hunter, the, whistleblower, said, that, the, white, house, had, attempted, to, cover, up, the, incident, and, that, the, call, was, part, of, a, wider, campaign, by, the, trump, administration, and, trump, attorney, rudy, giuliani, that, may, have, included, withholding,

and, barr, the, testimony, of, multiple, administration, officials, and, former, officials, confirmed, that, this, was, part, of, a, broader, effort, to, further, trump, s, personal, interests, by,

the, goal, was, to, coerce, zelenskyy, into, making, a, public, commitment, to, investigate, the, company, that, employed, hunter, biden, as, well, as, rumors, about, ukrainian, involvement, in, the, 2016, u, s, presidential, election, he, said, it, was, made, clear, that, until, zelenskyy, made, such, an, announcement, the, administration, would, not, release, scheduled, military, aid, for,

or, obstructed, congress, they, argued, that, the, impeachment, was, constitutionally, and, legally, invalid, because, trump, was, not, charged, with, a, crime, and, that, abuse, of, power, is, not,

without, evidence, that, the, election, would, be, rigged, and, that, the, expected, widespread, use, of, mail, balloting, would, produce, massive, election, fraud, when, in, august, the, house, of,
