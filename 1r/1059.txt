gaius, caesar, augustus, germanicus, 31, august, 12, 24, january, 41, better, known, by, his, nickname, caligula, k, l, j, l, was, roman, emperor, from, ad, 37, until, his, assassination, in, ad, 41, he, was, the, son, of, the, roman, general, germanicus, and, augustus, granddaughter, agrippina, the, elder, members, of, the, first, ruling, family, of, the, roman, empire, he, was, born, two, years, before, tiberius, was, made, emperor, gaius, accompanied, his, father, mother, and, siblings, on, campaign, in, germania, at, little, more, than, four, or, five, years, old, he, had, been, named, after, gaius, julius, caesar, but, his, father, s, soldiers, affectionately, nicknamed, him, caligula, little, boot, germanicus, died, at, antioch, in, 19, and, agrippina, returned, with, her, six, children, to, rome, where, she, became, entangled, in, a, bitter, feud, with, emperor, tiberius, who, was, germanicus, biological, uncle, and, adoptive, father, the, conflict, eventually, led, to, the, destruction, of, her, family, with, caligula, as, the, sole, male, survivor, in, 26, tiberius, withdrew, from, public, life, to, the, island, of, capri, and, in, 31, caligula, joined, him, there, tiberius, died, in, 37, and, caligula, succeeded, him, as, emperor, at, the, age, of, 24, of, the, few, surviving, sources, about, caligula, and, his, four, year, reign, most, were, written, by, members, of, the, nobility, and, senate, long, after, the, events, they, purport, to, describe, for, the, early, part, of, his, reign, he, is, said, to, have, been, good, generous, fair, and, community, spirited, but, increasingly, self, indulgent, cruel, sadistic, extravagant, and, sexually, perverted, thereafter, an, insane, murderous, tyrant, who, demanded, and, received, worship, as, a, living, god, humiliated, his, senate, and, planned, to, make, his, horse, a, consul, most, modern, commentaries, seek, to, explain, caligula, s, position, personality, and, historical, context, many, of, the, allegations, against, him, are, dismissed, by, some, historians, as, misunderstandings, exaggeration, mockery, or, malicious, fantasy, during, his, brief, reign, caligula, worked, to, increase, the, unconstrained, personal, power, of, the, emperor, as, opposed, to, countervailing, powers, within, the, principate, he, directed, much, of, his, attention, to, ambitious, construction, projects, and, public, works, to, benefit, rome, s, ordinary, citizens, including, racetracks, theatres, amphitheatres, and, improvements, to, roads, and, ports, he, began, the, construction, of, two, aqueducts, in, rome, the, aqua, claudia, and, the, anio, novus, during, his, reign, the, empire, annexed, the, client, kingdom, of, mauretania, as, a, province, he, had, to, abandon, an, attempted, invasion, of, britain, and, the, installation, of, his, statue, in, the, temple, of, jerusalem, in, early, 41, caligula, was, assassinated, as, a, result, of, a, conspiracy, by, officers, of, the, praetorian, guard, senators, and, courtiers, at, least, some, of, the, conspirators, might, have, planned, this, as, an, opportunity, to, restore, the, roman, republic, and, aristocratic, privileges, but, if, so, their, plan, was, thwarted, by, the, praetorians, who, seem, to, have, spontaneously, chosen, caligula, s, uncle, claudius, as, the, next, emperor, caligula, s, death, marked, the, official, end, of, the, julii, caesares, in, the, male, line, though, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, continued, to, rule, until, the, demise, of, caligula, s, nephew, the, emperor, nero, caligula, was, born, in, antium, on, 31, august, ad, 12, the, third, of, six, surviving, children, of, germanicus, and, his, wife, and, second, cousin, agrippina, the, elder, germanicus, was, a, grandson, of, mark, antony, and, agrippina, was, the, daughter, of, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, and, julia, the, elder, making, her, the, granddaughter, of, augustus, the, future, emperor, claudius, was, caligula, s, paternal, uncle, caligula, had, two, older, brothers, nero, and, drusus, and, three, younger, sisters, agrippina, the, younger, julia, drusilla, and, julia, livilla, at, the, age, of, two, or, three, he, accompanied, his, father, germanicus, on, campaigns, in, the, north, of, germania, he, wore, a, miniature, soldier, s, outfit, devised, by, his, mother, to, please, the, troops, including, army, boots, caligae, and, armour, the, soldiers, nicknamed, him, caligula, little, boot, winterling, believes, he, would, have, enjoyed, the, attention, of, the, soldiers, to, whom, he, was, something, of, a, mascot, though, he, later, grew, to, dislike, the, nickname, germanicus, was, a, respected, immensely, popular, figure, among, his, troops, and, roman, civilians, of, every, class, and, was, widely, expected, to, eventually, succeed, his, uncle, tiberius, as, emperor, for, his, successful, northern, campaigns, he, was, awarded, the, great, honour, of, a, triumph, during, the, triumphal, procession, through, rome, caligula, and, his, siblings, shared, their, father, s, chariot, and, the, applause, of, the, populace, a, few, months, later, germanicus, was, despatched, to, tour, rome, s, allies, and, provinces, with, his, family, they, were, received, with, great, honour, at, assos, caligula, gave, a, public, speech, aged, only, 6, somewhere, en, route, germanicus, contracted, what, proved, to, be, a, fatal, illness, he, lingered, awhile, and, died, at, antioch, syria, in, ad, 19, aged, 33, convinced, that, he, had, been, poisoned, by, the, provincial, governor, gnaius, calpurnius, piso, many, believed, that, he, had, been, killed, at, the, behest, of, tiberius, as, a, potential, rival, germanicus, was, cremated, and, his, ashes, were, taken, to, rome, escorted, by, his, wife, and, children, pretorian, guards, civilian, mourners, and, senators, then, placed, in, the, mausoleum, of, augustus, caligula, lived, with, his, mother, agrippina, in, rome, in, a, milieu, very, different, from, that, of, his, earlier, years, agrippina, made, no, secret, of, her, imperial, ambitions, for, herself, and, her, sons, and, in, consequence, her, relations, with, tiberius, rapidly, deteriorated, tiberius, believed, himself, under, constant, threat, from, treason, conspiracy, and, political, rivalry, he, forbade, agrippina, to, remarry, for, fear, that, a, remarriage, would, serve, her, personal, ambition, and, introduce, yet, another, threat, to, himself, the, last, years, of, his, principate, were, dominated, by, treason, trials, whose, outcomes, were, determined, by, senatorial, vote, agrippina, and, caligula, s, brother, nero, were, tried, and, banished, in, the, year, 29, on, charges, of, treason, the, adolescent, caligula, was, sent, to, live, with, his, great, grandmother, tiberius, mother, livia, after, her, death, two, years, later, he, was, sent, to, live, with, his, grandmother, antonia, minor, in, the, year, 30, tiberius, had, caligula, s, brothers, drusus, and, nero, declared, public, enemies, by, the, senate, and, exiled, caligula, and, his, three, sisters, remained, in, italy, as, hostages, of, tiberius, kept, under, close, watch, in, 31, caligula, s, brother, nero, died, in, exile, caligula, was, remanded, to, the, personal, care, of, tiberius, at, villa, jovis, on, capri, he, was, befriended, by, tiberius, praetorian, prefect, naevius, sutorius, macro, macro, had, been, active, in, the, downfall, of, sejanus, his, ambitious, and, manipulative, predecessor, in, office, and, was, a, trusted, communicant, between, the, emperor, and, his, senate, in, rome, philo, jewish, diplomat, and, later, witness, to, several, events, in, caligula, s, court, writes, that, macro, protected, and, supported, caligula, allaying, any, suspicions, tiberius, might, harbour, concerning, his, young, ward, s, ambitions, macro, represented, caligula, to, tiberius, as, friendly, obedient, and, devoted, to, tiberius, grandson, tiberius, gemellus, who, was, seven, years, younger, than, himself, caligula, is, described, during, this, time, as, a, first, rate, orator, well, informed, cultured, and, intelligent, a, natural, actor, who, recognized, the, danger, he, was, in, and, hid, his, resentment, of, tiberius, maltreatment, of, himself, and, his, family, behind, such, an, obsequious, manner, that, it, was, said, of, him, that, there, had, never, been, a, better, slave, or, a, worse, master, caligula, s, failure, to, protest, the, destruction, of, his, family, is, taken, by, tacitus, as, evidence, that, his, monstrous, character, was, masked, by, a, hypocritical, modesty, winterling, observes, that, a, forthright, protest, would, certainly, have, cost, him, his, life, in, 33, caligula, s, mother, and, his, brother, drusus, died, still, in, exile, in, the, same, year, tiberius, arranged, the, marriage, of, caligula, and, junia, claudilla, daughter, of, one, of, tiberius, most, influential, allies, in, the, senate, marcus, junius, silanus, and, was, given, an, honorary, quaestorship, in, the, cursus, honorum, a, series, of, political, promotions, that, could, lead, to, consulship, caligula, would, hold, this, very, junior, senatorial, post, until, his, sudden, nomination, as, emperor, junia, died, in, childbirth, the, following, year, along, with, her, baby, in, 35, tiberius, named, caligula, as, joint, heir, with, tiberius, grandson, gemellus, caligula, s, junior, by, seven, years, and, not, yet, an, adult, but, otherwise, a, viable, candidate, for, the, principate, tiberius, seemed, in, good, health, and, likely, to, survive, to, gemellus, majority, in, philo, s, account, tiberius, was, genuinely, fond, of, gemellus, but, doubted, his, personal, capacity, to, rule, and, feared, for, his, safety, should, caligula, come, to, power, suetonius, claims, that, tiberius, ever, mistrustful, but, still, shrewd, in, his, mid, 70s, saw, through, caligula, s, apparent, self, possession, to, an, underlying, erratic, and, unreliable, temperament, not, one, to, be, trusted, in, government, and, he, claims, that, caligula, took, pleasure, in, cruelty, torture, and, sexual, vice, of, every, kind, tiberius, is, said, to, have, indulged, the, young, man, s, appetite, for, theatre, dance, and, singing, in, the, hope, that, this, would, help, soften, his, otherwise, savage, nature, he, used, to, say, now, and, then, that, to, allow, gaius, to, live, would, prove, the, ruin, of, himself, and, of, all, men, and, that, he, was, rearing, a, viper, for, the, roman, people, and, a, phaethon, for, the, world, winterling, points, out, that, this, judgment, draws, on, later, not, particularly, accurate, accounts, of, caligula, s, rule, suetonius, credits, tiberius, with, a, knowledge, of, human, nature, which, in, reality, was, not, only, foreign, to, him, but, famously, unsound, at, capri, caligula, learned, to, dissimulate, he, probably, owed, his, life, to, that, and, as, all, the, ancient, sources, agree, to, macro, many, believed, or, claimed, to, believe, that, given, a, little, more, time, tiberius, would, have, eliminated, caligula, as, a, possible, successor, but, died, before, this, could, be, done, tiberius, died, on, 16, march, ad, 37, a, day, before, the, liberalia, festival, he, was, 78, years, old, suetonius, tacitus, and, cassius, dio, repeat, variously, elaborated, rumours, which, held, that, caligula, perhaps, with, macro, was, directly, responsible, for, his, death, philo, and, josephus, the, latter, a, romano, jewish, writer, who, served, vespasian, a, generation, later, describe, tiberius, death, as, natural, on, the, same, day, caligula, was, hailed, as, emperor, by, members, of, the, praetorian, guard, at, misenum, his, leadership, of, the, domus, caesaris, caesar, s, household, as, its, sole, heir, and, pater, familias, was, ratified, by, the, senate, who, acclaimed, him, imperator, two, days, after, the, death, of, tiberius, caligula, entered, rome, on, 28, or, 29, march, and, with, the, consensus, of, the, three, orders, senate, equestrians, and, common, citizens, the, senate, conferred, on, him, the, right, and, power, to, decide, on, all, affairs, in, a, single, day, and, with, a, single, piece, of, legislation, the, 25, year, old, caligula, previously, a, virtual, unknown, in, rome, s, political, life, and, with, no, military, service, was, thus, granted, the, same, trappings, authority, and, powers, that, augustus, had, accumulated, piecemeal, over, a, lifetime, and, sometimes, reluctantly, until, his, first, formal, meeting, with, the, senate, caligula, refrained, from, using, the, titles, they, had, granted, him, his, studied, deference, must, have, gone, some, way, to, reassure, the, more, astute, that, he, should, prove, amenable, to, their, guidance, some, must, have, resented, the, political, manipulations, that, led, to, this, extraordinary, settlement, caligula, was, now, entitled, to, make, break, or, ignore, any, laws, he, chose, augustus, had, shown, and, tiberius, had, failed, to, realise, that, the, roles, of, primus, inter, pares, first, among, equals, and, princeps, legibus, solutus, a, princeps, not, bound, by, the, laws, required, the, exercise, of, personal, responsibility, self, restraint, and, above, all, tact, as, if, the, senate, still, held, the, power, they, had, voluntarily, surrendered, in, barrett, s, words, caligula, would, be, restrained, only, by, his, own, sense, of, discretion, which, became, in, lamentably, short, supply, as, his, reign, progressed, caligula, dutifully, asked, the, senate, to, approve, divine, honours, for, his, predecessor, but, was, turned, down, in, line, with, senatorial, and, popular, opinion, regarding, the, dead, emperor, s, worth, caligula, did, not, push, the, issue, he, had, made, the, necessary, gesture, of, filial, respect, tiberius, will, named, two, heirs, caligula, and, gemellus, but, the, latter, was, still, a, minor, and, could, not, hold, any, kind, of, office, the, will, was, annulled, with, the, standard, justification, that, tiberius, must, have, been, insane, when, he, composed, it, incapable, of, good, judgment, although, tiberius, will, had, been, legally, set, aside, caligula, honoured, many, of, its, terms, and, in, some, cases, improved, on, them, tiberius, had, provided, each, praetorian, guardsman, with, a, generous, gratitude, payment, of, 500, sesterces, caligula, doubled, this, and, took, credit, for, its, payment, as, an, act, of, personal, generosity, he, also, paid, bonuses, to, the, city, troops, and, the, army, outside, italy, every, citizen, in, rome, was, given, 150, sesterces, and, heads, of, households, twice, that, amount, building, projects, on, the, palatine, hill, and, elsewhere, were, also, announced, which, would, have, been, the, largest, of, these, expenditures, thanks, to, macro, s, preparations, on, his, behalf, caligula, s, accession, was, a, brilliantly, stage, managed, affair, the, legions, had, already, sworn, loyalty, to, caligula, as, their, imperator, now, caligula, gave, the, miserly, tiberius, a, magnificent, funeral, at, public, expense, and, a, tearful, eulogy, and, met, with, an, ecstatic, popular, reception, along, the, funeral, route, and, in, rome, itself, among, caligula, s, first, acts, as, emperor, was, the, provision, of, public, games, on, a, grand, scale, philo, describes, caligula, in, these, early, days, as, universally, admired, suetonius, writes, that, caligula, was, loved, by, many, for, being, the, beloved, son, of, the, popular, germanicus, three, months, of, public, rejoicing, ushered, in, the, new, reign, philo, describes, the, first, seven, months, of, caligula, s, reign, as, a, golden, age, of, happiness, and, prosperity, josephus, claims, that, in, the, first, two, years, of, his, reign, caligula, s, high, minded, even, handed, rule, earned, him, goodwill, throughout, the, empire, caligula, took, up, his, first, consulship, on, 1, july, two, months, after, his, succession, he, accepted, all, titles, and, honours, offered, him, except, pater, patriae, father, of, the, fatherland, which, had, been, conferred, on, augustus, caligula, refused, it, protesting, his, youth, until, 21, september, 37, he, commemorated, his, own, father, germanicus, with, portraits, on, coinage, adopted, his, name, and, renamed, the, month, of, september, after, him, he, granted, his, sisters, and, his, grandmother, antonia, minor, extraordinary, privileges, normally, reserved, for, the, vestals, and, female, priesthoods, of, the, deified, augustus, their, powers, were, entirely, ceremonial, not, executive, but, their, names, were, included, in, the, standard, formulas, used, in, the, senate, house, to, invoke, divine, blessings, on, debates, and, procedings, and, the, annual, prayers, for, the, safety, of, emperor, and, state, caligula, named, his, favourite, sister, drusilla, as, heir, to, his, imperium, oaths, were, sworn, in, the, name, of, caligula, and, his, entire, family, one, of, his, sesterces, not, only, identifies, each, sister, by, name, but, associates, her, with, a, particular, imperial, virtue, security, concord, or, fortune, caligula, ordered, that, an, image, of, his, deceased, mother, agrippina, must, accompany, all, festival, processions, he, made, his, uncle, claudius, his, consular, colleague, tasked, with, siting, statues, of, caligula, s, two, dead, brothers, and, occasionaly, standing, in, for, caligula, at, games, feasts, and, ceremonies, claudius, own, family, found, his, limp, and, stammer, something, of, a, public, embarrassment, he, mismanaged, the, statue, commission, and, his, first, consulship, ended, soon, after, alongside, caligula, s, but, his, appointment, elevated, him, from, mere, equestrian, to, senator, and, eligible, for, consulship, barrett, and, yardley, describe, claudius, consulship, as, an, astonishingly, enlightened, gesture, on, caligula, s, part, not, one, of, caligula, s, attempts, to, court, popularity, as, suetonius, would, have, it, caligula, made, a, public, show, of, burning, tiberius, secret, papers, which, gave, details, of, his, infamous, treason, trials, they, included, accusations, of, villainy, and, betrayal, against, various, senators, many, of, whom, had, willingly, assisted, in, prosecutions, of, their, own, number, to, gain, financial, advantage, imperial, favour, or, to, divert, suspicion, away, from, themselves, any, expression, of, dissatisfaction, with, the, emperor, s, rule, or, decisions, could, be, taken, as, undermining, the, state, and, lead, to, prosecution, for, maiestas, treason, caligula, claimed, falsely, as, it, later, turned, out, that, he, had, read, none, of, these, documents, before, burning, them, he, used, a, coin, issue, to, advertise, his, claim, that, he, had, restored, the, security, of, the, laws, which, had, suffered, during, tiberius, prolonged, absence, from, rome, he, reduced, a, backlog, of, court, cases, in, rome, by, adding, more, jurors, and, suspending, the, requirement, that, sentences, be, confirmed, by, imperial, office, stressing, his, descent, from, augustus, caligula, retrieved, the, remains, of, his, mother, and, brothers, from, their, places, of, exile, for, interment, in, the, mausoleum, of, augustus, caligula, began, work, on, a, temple, to, livia, widow, of, augustus, she, held, the, honorific, title, of, augusta, while, still, living, and, when, she, died, was, eventually, made, a, diva, goddess, of, the, roman, state, under, claudius, the, temple, had, been, vowed, in, her, lifetime, but, not, constructed, between, approximately, mid, october, and, mid, november, 37, caligula, fell, seriously, ill, through, unknown, causes, and, hovered, for, a, month, or, so, between, life, and, death, rome, s, public, places, filled, with, citizens, who, implored, the, gods, for, his, recovery, some, even, offering, their, own, lives, in, exchange, by, late, october, their, emperor, had, recovered, and, embarked, on, what, might, have, been, a, purge, of, suspected, opponents, or, conspirators, caligula, s, relations, with, his, senate, had, been, congenial, but, were, now, sullied, by, the, forced, suicide, for, reasons, unknown, of, the, eminent, senator, silanus, formerly, caligula, s, father, in, law, gemellus, caligula, s, adopted, son, and, heir, now, 18, years, old, and, legally, adult, was, also, disposed, of, suetonius, offers, several, versions, of, gemellus, death, in, one, gemellus, was, given, the, adult, toga, virilis, then, charged, with, having, taken, an, antidote, implicitly, accusing, caligula, of, wanting, to, poison, him, and, forced, to, kill, himself, several, months, later, in, early, 38, caligula, forced, suicide, on, his, praetorian, prefect, macro, without, whose, help, and, protection, he, would, not, have, survived, let, alone, gained, the, throne, as, sole, ruler, any, link, between, the, deaths, is, speculative, but, it, is, possible, that, silanus, had, conspired, to, make, gemellus, emperor, should, caligula, fail, to, recover, and, caligula, might, simply, have, tired, of, macro, s, control, and, influence, in, 38, caligula, nominated, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, as, his, heir, and, married, him, to, his, beloved, sister, drusilla, but, on, 19, june, that, year, drusilla, died, she, was, deified, and, renamed, panthea, all, goddesses, the, first, mortal, woman, in, roman, history, to, be, made, a, diva, goddess, of, state, caligula, bereft, declared, a, period, of, compulsory, universal, mourning, drusilla, s, death, is, one, of, several, events, approximate, to, the, time, of, caligula, s, illness, besides, the, death, of, antonia, and, any, unreported, effects, of, the, illness, itself, thought, by, some, to, contribute, to, a, fundamental, change, in, caligula, s, attitudes, purges, so, early, in, caligula, s, reign, suggest, to, weidemann, that, the, new, emperor, had, learnt, a, great, deal, from, tiberius, and, that, attempts, to, divide, his, reign, into, a, good, beginning, followed, by, unremitting, atrocities, are, misplaced, caligula, shared, many, of, the, popular, passions, and, enthusiasms, of, the, lower, classes, and, young, aristocrats, public, spectacles, particularly, gladiator, contests, chariot, and, horse, racing, the, theatre, and, gambling, but, all, on, a, scale, with, which, the, nobility,

19, by, augustus, and, tiberius, banned, voluntary, participation, of, the, elite, in, any, public, spectacles, but, the, ban, was, never, particularly, effective, and, was, broadly, ignored, in, caligula, s, reign, during, caligula, s, illness, two, citizens, one, of, whom, was, an, equestrian, offered, to, fight, as, gladiators, if, only, the, gods, would, spare, the, emperor, s, life, the, offers, were, insincere, intended, to, flatter, and, invite, reward, when, caligula, recovered, he, insisted, that, they, be, taken, at, face, value, to, avoid, accusations, of, perjury, cynical, but, not, without, wit, of, a, kind, in, 38, caligula, lifted, censorship, and, published, accounts, of, public, funds, and, expenditure, suetonius, congratulates, this, as, the, first, such, act, by, any, emperor, very, soon, after, his, succession, he, restored, the, right, of, the, popular, assembly, comitia, to, elect, magistrates, on, behalf, of, the, common, citizenry, a, right, that, had, been, taken, over, by, the, senate, under, tiberius, and, augustus, the, aediles, elected, officials, who, managed, public, games, and, festivals, and, maintained, the, fabric, of, roads, and, shrines, would, now, have, incentive, to, spend, their, own, money, on, lavish, high, profile, spectacles, and, other, munera, gifts, to, the, state, or, people, to, win, the, popular, vote, dio, writes, that, this, though, delighting, the, rabble, grieved, the, sensible, who, stopped, to, reflect, that, if, the, offices, should, fall, once, more, into, the, hands, of, the, many, many, disasters, would, result, when, the, senate, outright, refused, to, accept, this, caligula, restored, control, of, elections, to, them, either, way, the, emperor, ultimately, chose, which, candidates, stood, for, election, and, which, were, elected, caligula, was, quite, capable, of, recognising, his, own, plans, and, decisions, as, flawed, and, abandoning, revising, or, reversing, them, when, faced, with, opposition, he, was, open, to, good, advice, but, could, just, as, easily, take, its, offering, as, an, insult, to, his, youth, or, understanding, philo, quotes, his, warning, who, dares, teach, me, caligula, abandoned, his, plan, to, convert, the, temple, of, jerusalem, to, a, temple, of, the, imperial, cult, with, a, statue, of, himself, as, zeus, when, warned, that, the, plan, would, arouse, extreme, protests, and, injure, the, local, economy, he, gave, funds, where, they, were, needed, he, helped, those, who, lost, property, in, fires, and, abolished, a, deeply, unpopular, tax, on, sales, but, whether, his, extravagant, gifts, to, favourites, during, his, earliest, reign, be, they, actors, charioteers, or, other, public, performers, drew, on, his, personal, wealth, or, state, coffers, is, not, known, personal, generosity, and, magnanimity, coupled, with, discretion, and, responsibility, were, expected, of, the, ruling, elite, and, the, emperor, in, particular, at, some, time, caligula, ruled, that, bequests, to, office, holders, remain, property, of, the, office, not, of, the, office, holder, suetonius, claims, that, caligula, squandered, 2, 7, billion, sesterces, in, his, first, year, and, addressed, the, consequent, treasury, deficit, by, confiscating, the, estates, of, wealthy, individuals, after, false, accusations, fines, or, outright, seizure, even, the, death, penalty, as, a, means, of, raising, money, this, seems, to, have, started, in, earnest, around, the, time, of, caligula, s, confrontation, with, the, senate, in, early, 39, suetonius, s, retrospective, balance, sheet, overlooks, what, would, have, been, owed, to, caligula, personally, and, in, his, capacity, as, emperor, on, tiberius, death, and, the, release, of, the, former, emperor, s, hoarded, wealth, into, the, economy, at, large, caligula, s, inheritance, included, the, deceased, empress, livia, s, vast, bequest, which, caligula, distributed, among, its, nominated, public, private, and, religious, beneficiaries, barrett, 2015, asserts, that, this, massive, cash, injection, would, have, given, the, roman, economy, a, tremendous, boost, dio, remarks, the, beginnings, of, a, financial, crisis, in, 39, and, connects, it, to, the, cost, of, caligula, s, extravagant, bridge, building, project, at, baiae, suetonius, has, presumably, the, same, financial, crisis, starting, in, 38, he, does, not, mention, a, bridge, but, lists, a, broad, range, of, caligula, s, extravagances, said, to, have, exhausted, the, state, treasury, to, wilkinson, caligula, s, uninterrupted, use, of, precious, metals, in, coin, issues, does, not, suggest, a, bankrupt, treasury, though, there, must, have, been, a, blurring, of, boundaries, between, caligula, s, personal, wealth, and, his, income, as, head, of, state, caligula, s, immediate, successor, claudius, abolished, taxes, embarked, on, various, costly, building, projects, and, donated, 15, 000, sesterces, to, each, praetorian, guard, in, 41, as, his, own, reign, began, which, suggests, that, caligula, had, left, him, a, solvent, treasury, in, the, long, term, the, occasional, windfall, aside, caligula, s, spending, exceeded, his, income, fund, raising, through, taxation, became, a, major, preoccupation, provincial, citizens, were, liable, for, direct, payment, of, taxes, used, to, fund, the, military, a, payment, from, which, italians, were, exempt, caligula, abolished, some, taxes, including, the, deeply, unpopular, sales, tax, but, he, introduced, an, unprecedented, range, of, new, ones, and, rather, than, employ, professional, tax, farmers, publicani, in, their, collection, he, made, this, a, duty, of, the, notoriously, forceful, praetorian, guard, dio, and, suetonius, describe, these, taxes, as, shameful, some, were, remarkably, petty, caligula, taxed, taverns, artisans, slaves, and, the, hiring, of, slaves, edibles, sold, in, the, city, litigation, anywhere, in, the, empire, weddings, or, marriages, the, wages, of, porters, or, perhaps, couriers, and, most, infamously, a, tax, on, prostitutes, active, retired, or, married, or, their, pimps, liable, for, a, sum, equivalent, to, a, single, transaction, citizens, of, provincial, italy, lost, their, previous, tax, exemptions, most, individual, tax, bills, were, fairly, small, but, cumulative, over, caligula, s, brief, reign, taxes, were, doubled, overall, even, then, the, revenue, was, nowhere, near, enough, and, the, imposition, was, deeply, resented, by, rome, s, commoners, josephus, claims, that, this, led, to, riotous, protests, at, the, circus, barrett, remarks, that, stories, of, consequent, mass, executions, there, by, the, military, should, almost, certainly, be, dismissed, as, standard, exaggeration, property, or, money, left, to, tiberius, as, emperor, but, not, collected, on, his, death, would, have, passed, to, caligula, as, office, holder, roman, inheritance, law, recognised, a, legator, s, obligation, to, provide, for, his, family, caligula, seems, to, have, considered, his, fatherly, duties, to, the, state, entitled, him, to, a, share, of, every, will, from, pious, subjects, the, army, was, not, exempt, centurions, who, left, nothing, or, too, little, to, the, emperor, could, be, judged, guilty, of, ingratitude, and, have, their, wills, set, aside, centurions,

and, their, children, are, taken, literally, by, suetonius, and, dio, mcginn, believes, they, could, be, based, on, a, single, incident, extended, to, an, institution, in, the, telling, similar, allegations, would, be, made, in, the, future, against, commodus, and, elagabalus, winterling, citing, dio, 59, 28, 9, traces, the, outline, of, the, story, to, cassius, dio, s, account, for, ad, 40, and, his, allegation, that, the, noble, tennants, of, newly, built, suites, of, rooms, at, the, palace, were, compelled, to, pay, exorbitant, rents, for, the, privilege, of, living, so, close, to, caligula, and, under, the, protection, of, the, praetorians, no, brothel, is, mentioned, in, this, account, suetonius, appears, to, reverse, the, traditional, aristocratic, client, patron, ceremonies, of, mutual, obligation, and, have, caligula, accepting, payments, for, maintenance, from, his, loyal, consular, friends, at, morning, salutations, evening, banquets, and, bequest, announcments, the, sheer, numbers, of, friends, involved, meant, that, meticulous, records, were, kept, of, who, had, paid, how, much, and, who, still, owed, his, agents, would, then, visit, the, very, same, consuls, who, had, been, involved, in, conspiracies, against, him, rail, against, the, senate, s, treachery, en, masse, but, ask, for, gifts, from, individuals, to, express, their, loyal, friendship, in, return, a, refusal, was, unthinkable, winterling, describes, the, families, who, occupied, these, rooms, as, hostage, under, the, supervision, of, the, praetorians, some, paid, up, willingly, some, reluctantly, but, all, paid, caligula, made, loans, available, at, high, interest, to, those, who, lacked, the, necessary, funds, to, complete, the, humiliation, of, rome, s, elite, especially, the, old, republican, families, despite, his, biographers, attempts, to, ridicule, caligula, s, taxes, many, were, continued, after, his, death, the, military, remained, responsible, for, all, tax, collection, and, the, tax, on, prostitution, continued, up, to, the, reign, of, severus, alexander, caligula, s, ruling, that, bequests, made, to, any, reigning, emperor, became, property, of, his, office, not, himself, as, a, private, individual, was, made, constitutional, under, antoninus, pius, caligula, did, not, change, the, structure, of, the, monetary, system, established, by, augustus, and, continued, by, tiberius, but, the, contents, of, his, coinage, differed, from, theirs, the, location, of, the, imperial, mint, for, the, coins, of, precious, metals, gold, and, silver, is, a, matter, of, debate, among, ancient, numismatists, it, seems, that, caligula, initially, produced, his, precious, coins, from, lugdunum, now, lyon, france, like, his, predecessors, then, moved, the, mint, to, rome, in, 37, 38, although, it, is, possible, that, this, move, occurred, later, under, nero, his, base, metal, coinage, was, struck, in, rome, unlike, tiberius, whose, coins, remained, almost, unchanged, throughout, his, reign, caligula, used, a, variety, of, types, mostly, featuring, divus, augustus, as, well, as, his, parents, germanicus, and, agrippina, his, dead, brothers, nero, and, drusus, and, his, three, sisters, agrippina, drusilla, and, livilla, the, reason, for, the, extensive, emphasis, on, his, relatives, was, to, highlight, caligula, s, double, claim, to, the, principate, from, both, the, julian, and, claudian, sides, of, the, dynasty, and, to, call, for, the, unity, of, the, family, the, sesterce, with, his, three, sisters, was, discontinued, after, 39, due, to, caligula, s, suspicion, regarding, their, loyalty, he, also, made, a, sesterce, celebrating, the, praetorian, cohorts, as, a, mean, to, give, them, the, bequest, of, tiberius, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, caligula, minted, a, quadrans, a, small, bronze, coin, to, mark, the, abolition, of, the, ducentesima, a, 0, 5, tax, on, sales, the, output, of, the, precious, metal, mints, was, small, and, his, sesterces, were, mostly, made, in, limited, quantities, which, make, his, coins, now, very, rare, this, rarity, cannot, be, attributed, to, caligula, s, alleged, damnatio, memoriae, reported, by, dio, as, removing, his, coins, from, circulation, would, have, been, impossible, besides, mark, antony, s, coins, continued, to, circulate, for, two, centuries, after, his, death, caligula, s, common, coins, are, base, metal, types, with, vesta, germanicus, and, agrippina, the, elder, and, the, most, common, is, an, as, with, his, grandfather, agrippa, finally, caligula, kept, open, the, mint, at, caesarea, in, cappadocia, which, had, been, created, by, tiberius, in, order, to, pay, military, expenses, in, the, province, with, silver, drachmae, numismatists, harold, mattingly, and, edward, sydenham, consider, that, the, artistic, style, of, caligula, s, coins, is, below, those, of, tiberius, and, claudius, they, especially, criticize, the, portraits, which, are, too, hard, and, lack, details, caligula, had, a, fondness, for, grandiose, costly, building, projects, many, of, which, were, intended, to, benefit, or, entertain, the, general, population, but, are, described, in, roman, sources, as, wasteful, in, the, city, of, rome, he, completed, the, temple, of, augustus, and, the, theatre, of, pompey, he, is, said, to, have, built, a, bridge, between, the, temple, of, castor, and, pollux, and, the, capitol, barrett, 2015, believes, that, this, bridge, existed, only, in, suetonius, account, and, should, perhaps, be, dismissed, as, a, fantasy, with, possible, origins, in, some, jocular, remark, by, caligula, caligula, began, an, amphitheatre, beside, the, saepta, julia, he, cleared, the, latter, space, for, use, as, an, arena, and, filled, it, with, water, for, a, single, naumachia, a, sham, naval, battle, fought, as, entertainment, he, supervised, the, extension, and, rebuilding, of, the, imperial, palace, to, include, a, gallery, for, his, art, collection, philo, and, his, party, were, given, a, tour, of, the, gallery, during, their, diplomatic, visit, barrett, 2015, considers, philo, s, description, of, caligula, as, a, would, be, connoisseur, and, aesthete, as, probably, not, very, wide, of, the, mark, to, help, meet, rome, burgeoning, demand, for, fresh, water, he, began, the, construction, of, aqueducts, aqua, claudia, and, anio, novus, which, pliny, the, elder, considered, to, be, engineering, marvels, he, built, a, large, racetrack, now, known, as, the, circus, of, gaius, and, nero, in, its, central, spine, he, incorporated, an, egyptian, obelisk, now, known, as, the, vatican, obelisk, which, he, had, brought, by, sea, on, a, gigantic, purpose, built, ship, which, used, 120, 000, modi, of, lentils, as, ballast, at, syracuse, he, repaired, the, city, walls, and, temples, he, pushed, to, keep, roads, in, good, condition, throughout, the, empire, and, extended, the, existing, network, to, this, end,

they, had, dishonestly, used, for, other, purposes, or, fulfil, their, commissions, at, their, own, expense, caligula, planned, to, rebuild, the, palace, of, polycrates, at, samos, to, finish, the, temple, of, didymaean, apollo, at, ephesus, and, house, his, own, cult, and, image, there, and, to, found, a, city, high, up, in, the, alps, he, intended, to, dig, a, canal, through, the, isthmus, of, corinth, in, greece, and, sent, a, chief, centurion, to, survey, the, site, none, of, these, plans, came, to, fruition, in, the, course, of, 39, caligula, s, increasingly, tense, relationship, with, his, senate, deteriorated, into, outright, hostility, and, confrontation, this, is, one, of, dio, s, more, confusing, accounts, involving, conspiracies, denunciations, and, trials, for, treason,

hypocrisy, in, voting, honours, to, tiberius, and, sejanus, while, they, lived, and, rescinding, those, honours, once, their, recipients, were, safely, dead, he, declared, that, it, would, be, folly, to, seek, the, love, or, approval, of, such, men, they, hated, him, and, wanted, him, dead, so, it, would, be, better, that, they, should, fear, him, caligula, s, diatribes, exposed, the, idealised, princeps, or, first, senator, as, illusion, and, imposture, when, the, senate, returned, next, day, they, seemed, to, confirm, his, suspicions, and, voted, him, a, special, guard, of, armed, pretorians, to, protect, him, and, guard, his, statues, apparently, seeking, to, please, him, and, assure, his, safety, the, senate, proposed, that, his, senatorial, chair, be, raised, on, a, high, platform, even, in, the, very, senate, house, they, offered, a, thanksgiving, to, caligula, as, to, a, monarch, expressing, gratitude, for, allowing, them, to, live, when, others, had, died, winterling, suggests, that, caligula, s, three, subsequent, consulships, sworn, at, the, rostra, were, vain, attempts, to, make, amends, public, statements, of, respect, for, the, senators, as, his, equals, barrett, perceives, these, later, consulships, as, symbolic, of, caligula, s, continued, intention, to, dominate, the, senate, and, the, state, barrett, describes, the, change, in, caligula, s, rule, as, a, gradual, unravelling, a, descent, into, serious, mismanagement, and, impenetrable, mistrust, and, latterly, into, arbitrary, terror, but, dio, s, claim, that, in, fact, there, was, nothing, but, slaughter, is, undermined, by, evidence, that, most, senators, managed, to, survive, caligula, s, reign, with, their, persons, and, fortunes, intact, caligula, had, not, after, all, destroyed, tiberius, records, of, treason, trials, he, reviewed, them, and, decided, that, numerous, senators, discharged, from, tiberius, court, hearings, seemed, to, have, been, guilty, of, conspiracy, all, along, against, emperor, and, state, the, worst, form, of, maiestas, treason, tiberius, treason, trials, had, encouraged, professional, delatores, informers, who, were, loathed, by, the, populace, but, many, of, the, accused, had, testified, against, each, other, and, against, caligula, s, own, family, even, to, the, point, of, initiating, the, prosecutions, themselves, if, they, had, acted, against, caligula, s, family, they, might, act, against, caligula, himself, new, investigations, were, launched, dio, names, five, once, trusted, consular, senators, tried, for, maiestas, but, his, allegation, that, senators, or, others, were, put, to, death, in, great, numbers, is, unsupported, two, of, the, five, prospered, under, his, rule, and, beyond, caligula, preferred, to, publicly, humiliate, his, enemies, in, the, senate, especially, those, of, ancient, families, by, stripping, them, of, their, inherited, honours, dignities, and, titles, in, early, september, he, dismissed, the, two, suffect, consuls, citing, their, inadequate, low, key, celebration, of, his, birthday, august, 31, and, excessive, attention, to, the, anniversary, of, actium, september, 2, this, was, the, last, battle, in, a, damaging, civil, war, between, two, of, caligula, s, close, ancestors, which, he, found, no, cause, for, celebration, one, of, the, dismissed, consuls, killed, himself, caligula, may, have, suspected, him, of, conspiracy, suetonius, and, dio, outline, caligula, s, supposed, proposal, to, promote, his, favourite, racehorse, incitatus, swift, to, consul, and, later, a, priest, of, his, own, cult, this, could, have, been, an, extended, joke, created, by, caligula, himself, in, mockery, of, the, senate, a, persistent, popular, belief, that, caligula, actually, promoted, his, horse, to, consul, has, become, a, byword, for, the, promotion, of, incompetents, especially, in, political, life, it, may, have, been, one, of, caligula, s, many, oblique, malicious, or, darkly, humorous, insults, mostly, directed, at, the, senatorial, class, but, also, against, himself, and, his, family, winterling, sees, it, as, an, insult, to, the, consulars, themselves, an, aristocrat, s, highest, ambition, the, consulship, could, be, laid, open, to, ruinous, competition, and, at, the, same, time, to, ridicule, david, woods, believes, it, unlikely, that, caligula, meant, to, insult, the, post, of, consul, as, he, had, held, it, himself, suetonius, possibly, failing, to, get, the, joke, presents, it, as, further, proof, of, caligula, s, insanity, adding, circumstantial, details, more, usually, expected, of, the, senatorial, nobility, including, palaces, servants, and, golden, goblets, and, invitations, to, banquets, in, 39, or, 40, by, suetonius, reckoning, caligula, ordered, a, temporary, floating, bridge, to, be, built, using, a, double, line, of, ships, as, pontoons, earth, paved, and, stretching, for, over, two, miles, from, the, resort, of, baiae, near, naples, to, the, neighbouring, port, of, puteoli, with, resting, places, between, some, ships, were, built, on, site, but, grain, ships, were, also, requisitioned, brought, to, site,

great, and, rode, his, favourite, horse, incitatus, across, the, bridge, perhaps, defying, a, prediction, attributed, by, suetonius, to, tiberius, soothsayer, thrasyllus, of, mendes, that, caligula, had, no, more, chance, of, becoming, emperor, than, of, riding, a, horse, across, the, bay, of, baiae, on, the, second, day, he, rode, the, bridge, from, end, to, end, several, times, at, full, tilt, accompanied, by, the, soldiery, famous, nobles, and, hostages, seneca, and, dio, claim, that, grain, imports, were, dangerously, depleted, by, caligula, s, re, purposing, of, rome, s, grain, ships, as, pontoons, barrett, finds, these, accusations, absurd, if, the, bridge, was, finished, in, 39, that, was, far, too, early, to, have, had, any, effect, on, the, annual, grain, supply, and, a, genuine, grain, crisis, was, simply, blamed, on, the, most, outlandish, episode, at, hand, dio, places, this, episode, soon, after, caligula, s, furious, denunciation, of, the, senate, barrett, speculates, that, caligula, may, have, intended, the, whole, event, as, an, object, lesson, on, how, completely, he, was, in, charge, it, may, also, provide, the, most, striking, example, of, his, wasteful, extravagance, its, pointlessness, might, have, been, the, whole, point, caligula, s, reign, saw, an, increase, of, tensions, between, jews, native, to, their, homeland, of, judea, jews, of,

would, undermine, their, own, status, and, privilege, caligula, had, replaced, the, prefect, of, egypt, aulus, avilius, flaccus, with, herod, agrippa, who, was, governor, of, batanaea, and, trachonitis, and, was, a, personal, friend, flaccus, had, conspired, against, caligula, s, mother, and, had, connections, with, egyptian, separatists, in, 38, caligula, sent, agrippa, to, alexandria, unannounced, to, check, on, flaccus, according, to, philo, the, visit, was, met, with, jeers, and, mockery, from, the, greek, population, who, saw, agrippa, as, a, gimcrack, king, of, the, jews, in,

atrocities, inflicted, on, alexandria, s, jews, within, and, around, this, ghetto, by, the, city, s, greek, population, caligula, held, flaccus, responsible, for, the, disturbances, exiled, him, and, eventually, executed, him, in, 39, agrippa, accused, his, uncle, herod, antipas, the, tetrarch, of, galilee, and, perea, of, planning, a, rebellion, against, roman, rule, with, the, help, of, parthia,

a, statue, of, himself, in, the, jewish, temple, of, jerusalem, a, political, rather, than, a, religious, act, for, rome, but, a, blasphemy, for, the, jews, and, in, conflict, with, jewish, monotheism, in, this, context, philo, wrote, that, caligula, regarded, the, jews, with, most, especial, suspicion, as, if, they, were, the, only, persons, who, cherished, wishes, opposed, to, his, in,

riots, neither, of, these, encounters, proved, decisive, both, gave, caligula, ample, opportunity, for, casual, friendly, banter, which, seems, to, have, included, humiliating, levity, always, at, the, jewish, delegation, s, expense, but, he, made, no, claims, of, divinity, either, in, his, dress, nor, his, speech, merely, asking, at, the, second, encounter, more, or, less, rhetorically, why, jews, found, his, veneration, so, difficult, philo, and, josephus, each, saw, caligula, s, behaviour, as, driven, by, his, claims, to, divinity, which, for, a, jew, would, have, virtually, defined, him, as, fundamentally, insane, despite, appearances, otherwise, the, ethnically, greek, population, of, alexandria, had, already, made, their, loyalty, to, the, new, emperor, clear, with, displays, of, his, image, as, focus, for, his, cult, the, destruction, of, the, altar, at, jamlia, and, presumably, removal, of, idolatrous, images, placed, in, synagogues, by, greek, citizens, might, have, been, intended, as, an, expression, of, jewish, religious, fervour, rather, than, a, response, aimed, at, one, tyrant, s, offensive, claims, of, personal, godhood, philo, seems, to, have, loathed, caligula, from, the, start, but, his, belief, that, caligula, hated, the, jews, and, was, preparing, their, destruction, has, no, basis, in, evidence, to, place, caligula, s, statue, in, temple, precincts, showing, him, dressed, as, jupiter, would, have, been, consistent, with, the, empire, wide, religious, phenomenon, known, as, imperial, cult, from, whose, full, expression, jews, had, so, far, been, exempted, they, could, offer, prayer, for, the, emperor, rather, than, to, him, far, from, a, perfect, compromise, but, the, highest, honour, that, jewish, tradition, permitted, in, honour, of, a, mortal, caligula, found, this, most, unsatisfactory, and, demanded, that, his, statue, be, installed, in, the, temple, of, jerusalem, forthwith, the, governor, of, syria, publius, petronius, ordered, a, statue, from, sidon, then, postponed, its, installation, for, as, long, he, could, rather, than, risk, a, serious, jewish, rebellion, in, some, versions, caligula, proved, amenable, to, rational, discussion, with, agrippa, and, jewish, authorities, and, faced, with, threats, of, rebellion, destruction, of, property, and, loss, of, the, grain, harvest, if, the, plan, went, ahead, abandoned, the, project, in, more, hostile, versions, caligula, being, demonstrably, insane, and, incapable, of, rational, discussion, impulsively, changed, his, mind, once, again, and, reissued, the, order, to, petronius, along, with, the, threat, of, enforced, suicide, if, he, failed, an, even, larger, statue, of, caligula, zeus, was, ordered, from, rome, the, ship, carrying, it, was, still,

ordered, the, concentration, of, military, forces, and, supplies, in, upper, germany, and, made, his, way, there, with, a, baggage, train, that, supposedly, included, actors, gladiators, women, and, a, detachment, of, praetorians, he, might, have, meant, to, follow, the, paths, of, his, father, and, grandfather, and, attack, the, germanic, tribes, along, the, upper, rhine, but, he, was, ill, prepared, and, retreated, in, a, panic, according, to, dio, his, achievement, was, negligible, but, caligula, used, the, opportunity, to, seize, the, wealth, of, rich, allies, whom, he, conveniently, suspected, of, treason, putting, some, to, death, on, the, grounds, that, they, were, plotting, or, rebelling, caligula, accused, the, imperial, legate, gaetulicus, of, nefarious, plots, and, had, him, executed, according, to, dio, he, was, killed, for, being, popular, with, his, troops, lepidus, along, with, caligula, s, two, sisters, agrippina, and, livilla, was, accused, of, being, part, of, this, conspiracy, he, too, was, executed, and, caligula, s, two, sisters, were, exiled, after, being, condemned, pro, forma, for, adultery, a, senatorial, embassy, arrived, from, rome, headed, by, caligula, s, uncle, claudius, to, congratulate, the, emperor, for, suppressing, this, latest, conspiracy, it, met, with, a, hostile, reception, in, which, claudius, was, supposedly, ducked, in, the, rhine, though, this, might, have, been, the, loser, s, award, in, a, contest, of, latin, and, greek, oratory, held, by, caligula, in, gaul, that, winter, on, caligula, s, return, from, the, north, he, abandoned, the, theatre, seating, plans, that, augustus, had, introduced, so, that, rank, alone, would, determine, one, s, place, in, the, consequent, free, for, all, seating, was, left, to, chance,

caligula, sent, a, communique, in, preparation, for, his, imminent, ovation, in, rome, following, his, military, activities, in, the, north, and, his, suppression, of, lepidus, he, announced, that, he, would, only, be, returning, to, those, who, wanted, him, back, to, the, equestrians, and, the, people, he, did, not, mention, the, senate, or, senators, of, whom, he, had, grown, increasingly, mistrustful, in, late, 39, caligula, wintered, at, lugdunum, modern, lyon, in, gaul, where, he, auctioned, off, his, sisters, portable, property, including, their, jewellery, slaves, and, freedmen, dio, claims, that, wealthy, bidders, at, these, auctions, were, willing, to, offer, far, more, than, items, were, worth, some, to, show, their, loyalty, and, others, to, rid, themselves, of, some, of, the, wealth, that, could, render, their, execution, worthwhile, caligula, is, said, to, have, used, intimidation, and, various, auctioneer, s, tricks, and, tactics, to, boost, prices, in, an, event, that, suetonius, describes, as, well, known, a, praetorian, gentleman, nodding, off, to, sleep, after, a, gladiator, match, woke, to, find, that, he, had, bought, 13, gladiators, for, the, vastly, over, inflated, sum, of, 9, million, sesterces, caligula, s, first, lugdunum, auction, proved, such, a, successful, fundraiser, that, he, had, many, of, the, furnishings, of, his, palace, in, rome, carted, to, lugdunum, and, auctioned, off, they, included, many, precious, family, heirlooms, caligula, recited, their, provenance, during, the, auction, in, an, attempt, to, help, ensure, a, fair, return, on, objects, intrinsically, valuable, and, seemingly, much, sought, after, by, the, wealthy, for, their, imperial, associations, income, from, this, second, auction, was, relatively, moderate, kleijwegt, 1996, describes, caligula, s, performance, as, vendor, and, auctioneer, at, this, second, auction, as, completely, out, of, character, with, the, image, of, a, tyrant, auctions, of, imperial, property, were, acceptable, ways, to, balance, the, books, practiced, by, augustus, and, later, by, trajan, they, were, expected, to, benefit, the, bidders, as, well, as, the, vendor, roman, auctioneers, were, held, in, very, low, esteem, but, kleijwegt, claims, that, caligula, seems, to, have, behaved, more, like, a, benevolent, princeps, in, this, second, auction, without, malice, greed, or, intimidation, in, the, spring, of, 40, caligula, tried, to, extend, roman, rule, into, britannia, two, legions, had, been, raised, for, this, purpose, both, likely, named, primigeniae, in, honour, of, caligula, s, newborn, daughter, ancient, sources, depict, caligula, as, being, too, cowardly, to, have, attacked, or, as, mad, but, stories, of, his, threatening, a, decimation, of, his, troops, indicate, mutinies, broadly, it, is, impossible, to, judge, why, the, army, never, embarked, on, the, invasion, beyond, mutinies, it, may, have, simply, been, that, british, chieftains, acceded, to, rome, s, demands, removing, any, justification, for, war, alternatively, it, could, have, been, merely, a, training, and, scouting, mission, or, a, short, expedition, to, accept, the, surrender, of, the, british, chieftain, adminius, suetonius, reports, that, caligula, ordered, his, men, to, collect, seashells, as, spoils, of, the, sea, this, may, also, be, a, mistranslation, of, musculi, meaning, siege, engines, the, conquest, of, britannia, was, later, achieved, during, the, reign, of, caligula, s, successor, claudius, in, 40, caligula, annexed, mauretania, a, wealthy, strategically, significant, client, kingdom, of, rome, inhabited, by, fiercely, independent, semi, nomads, who, resisted, romanisation, its, ruler, ptolemy, of, mauretania, was, a, noble, descendant, of, juba, ii, popular, extremely, wealthy, and, with, a, reputation, as, feckless, and, incompetent, ptolemy, failed, to, deal, effectively, with, an, uprising, and, was, removed, the, usual, fate, of, incompetent, client, kings, was, retirement, and, a, comfortable, exile, but, caligula, ordered, ptolemy, to, rome, and, had, him, executed, some, time, after, the, spring, of, 40, his, removal, proved, unpopular, enough, in, mauretania, to, provoke, an, uprising, rome, divided, mauretania, into, two, provinces, mauretania, tingitana, and, mauretania, caesariensis, separated, by, the, river, malua, pliny, claims, that, division, was, the, work, of, caligula, but, dio, states, that, the, uprising, was, subdued, in, 42, after, caligula, s, death, by, gaius, suetonius, paulinus, and, gnaeus, hosidius, geta, and, the, division, only, took, place, after, this, this, confusion, might, mean, that, caligula, decided, to, divide, the, province, but, postponed, the, division, because, of, the, rebellion, the, first, known, equestrian, governor, of, the, joint, provinces, was, marcus, fadius, celer, flavianus, in, office, in, 44, details, on, the, mauretanian, events, of, 39, 44, are, lost, including, an, entire, chapter, by, dio, on, the, annexation, dio, and, tacitus, suggest, that, caligula, may, have, been, motivated, by, fear, envy, and, consideration, of, his, own, ignominious, military, performance, in, the, north, rather, than, pressing, military, or, economic, needs, the, rebellion, of, tacfarinas, had, shown, how, exposed, africa, proconsularis, was, to, its, west, and, how, the, mauretanian, client, kings, were, unable, to, provide, protection, to, the, province, and, it, is, thus, possible, that, caligula, s, expansion, was, a, prudent, and, ultimately, successful, response, to, potential, future, threats, of, all, the, manifestations, of, wild, and, extravagant, behaviour, exhibited, by, caligula, during, his, brief, reign, nothing, has, better, served, to, confirm, the, popular, notion, of, his, insanity, than, his, apparent, demand, to, be, recognised, as, a, god, philo, caligula, s, contemporary, claims, that, caligula, costumed, himself, as, various, heroes, and, deities, starting, with, demigods, such, as, dionysos, herakles, and, the, dioscuri, and, working, up, to, major, deities, such, as, mercury, venus, and, apollo, philo, describes, these, impersonations, in, a, context, of, private, pantomime, or, theatrical, performances, he, may, have, witnessed, or, heard, of, during, his, diplomatic, visit, as, evidence, that, caligula, wanted, to, be, venerated, as, a, living, god, philo, as, a, jew, and, a, monotheist, took, this, as, proof, of, the, emperor, s, insanity, caligula, s, impersonations, had, a, precedent, augustus, had, once, thrown, a, party, in, which, he, and, his, guests, dressed, up, as, the, olympian, gods, augustus, was, made, up, and, dressed, as, apollo, no, one, was, thought, insane, in, consequence, and, none, claimed, to, be, the, god, they, impersonated, but, the, event, was, not, repeated, it, showed, near, blasphemous, disrespect, to, the, gods, in, question, and, insensitivity, to, the, population, at, large, the, feast, was, staged, during, a, famine, coin, issues, of, the, official, roman, mint, dated, to, the, early, 20s, bc, show, octavian, as, apollo, jupiter, and, neptune, this, too, may, have, been, thought, a, transgression, and, was, not, repeated, caligula, took, his, own, impersonations, less, seriously, than, some, certainly, less, seriously, than, philo, did, according, to, dio, when, a, gallic, shoemaker, laughed, to, see, caligula, dressed, as, jupiter, pronouncing, oracles, at, the, crowd, from, a, lofty, place, caligula, asked, and, who, do, you, think, i, am, the, shoemaker, answered, a, complete, idiot, caligula, seems, to, have, appreciated, his, straightforward, honesty, dio, claims, that, caligula, impersonated, jupiter, to, seduce, various, women, that, he, sometimes, referred, to, himself, as, a, divinity, in, public, meetings, and, that, he, was, sometimes, referred, to, as, jupiter, in, public, documents, caligula, s, special, interest, in, jupiter, as, rome, s, chief, deity, is, confirmed, by, all, surviving, sources, simpson, believes, that, caligula, may, have, considered, jupiter, an, equal, perhaps, a, rival, according, to, ittai, gradel, caligula, s, performances, as, various, deities, prove, no, more, than, a, penchant, for, theatrical, fancy, dress, and, a, mischievous, desire, to, shock, as, emperor, caligula, was, also, pontifex, maximus, one, of, rome, s, most, powerful, and, influential, state, priests, the, promotion, of, mortal, rulers, to, godlike, status, to, honour, their, superior, standing, and, perceived, merits, was, a, commonplace, phenomenon, among, rome, s, eastern, allies, and, client, states, during, their, eastern, tour, germanicus, agrippina, and, their, children, including, caligula, were, officially, received, as, living, deities, by, several, cities, of, the, greek, east, in, roman, culture, a, client, could, flatter, their, living, patron, as, jupiter, on, earth, without, reprimand, the, divi, deceased, members, of, the, imperial, family, promoted, to, divine, status, were, creations, of, the, senate, who, voted, them, into, official, existence, appointed, their, priesthood, and,

prosecuted, for, sacrificing, to, his, emperor, caligula, seems, to, have, taken, his, religious, duties, very, seriously, he, found, a, replacement, for, the, aged, priest, of, diana, at, lake, nemi, reorganised, the, salii, priests, of, mars, and, pedantically, insisted, that, as, it, was, nefas, religiously, improper, for, jupiter, s, leading, priest, the, flamen, dialis, to, swear, any, oath, he, could, not, swear, the, imperial, oath, of, loyalty, caligula, wished, to, take, over, or, share, the, half, finished, but, splendid, temple, of, apollo, in, greek, didyma, for, his, own, cult, seemingly, his, statue, was, prepared, but, possibly, not, installed, when, pausanias, visited, the, still, unfinished, temple, a, century, later, its, cult, statue, was, of, apollo, suetonius, and, dio, mention, a, temple, to, caligula, in, the, city, of, rome, most, modern, scholarship, agrees, that, if, such, a, temple, existed, it, was, probably, on, the, palatine, augustus, had, already, linked, the, temple, of, castor, and, pollux, directly, to, his, imperial, residence, on, the, palatine, and, established, an, official, priesthood, of, lesser, magistrates, the, seviri, augustales, usually, drawn, from, his, own, freedmen, to, serve, the, genius, augusti, his, family, spirit, and, lares, the, twin, ancestral, spirits, of, his, household, dio, claims, that, caligula, stationed, himself, to, receive, veneration, dressed, as, jupiter, latiaris, between, the, images, of, castor, and, pollux, the, twin, dioscuri, to, whom, he, referred, humorously, as, his, doorkeepers, dio, s, claim, that, two, temples, were, built, for, caligula, in, rome, is, unconfirmed, simpson, believes, it, likely, that, caligula, voted, a, temple, on, the, palatine, by, the, senate, funded, it, himself, an, embassy, from, greek, states, to, rome, greeted, caligula, as, the, new, god, augustus, in, the, greek, city, of, cyzicus, a, public, inscription, from, the, beginning, of, caligula, s, reign, gives, thanks, to, him, as, a, new, sun, god, egyptian, provincial, coinage, and, some, state, dupondii, show, caligula, enthroned, the, first, reigning, roman, princeps, to, be, described, as, the, new, sun, neos, helios, with, the, radiate, crown, of, the, sun, god, or, of, caligula, s, divine, antecedent, the, divus, augustus, caligula, s, image, on, other, state, coinage, carries, no, such, trappings, of, divinity, compared, to, the, full, blown, cults, to, major, deities, of, state, genius, cults, were, quite, modest, in, scope, augustus, once, deceased, was, officially, worshipped, as, a, divus, immortal, but, somewhat, less, than, a, full, blown, deity, tiberius, his, successor, forbade, his, own, personal, cult, outright, in, rome, itself, probably, in, consideration, of, julius, caesar, s, assassination, following, his, hubristic, promotion, as, a, living, divinity, augustus, and, after, him, tiberius, insisted, that, if, temples, to, honour, them, in, the, provinces, were, proposed, by, the, local, elite, they, must, be, shared, by, the, genius, of, the, senate, or, the, personification, of, the, roman, people, or, the, genius, of, rome, itself, dio, claims, that, caligula, sold, priesthoods, for, his, unofficial, genius, cult, to, the, wealthiest, nobles, for, a, per, capita, fee, of, 10, million, sesterces, and, made, loans, available, to, those, who, could, not, afford, immediate, full, payment, his, priests, supposedly, included, his, wife, caesonia, and, his, uncle, claudius, whom, dio, claims, was, bankrupted, by, the, cost, the, circumstances, mark, this, out, as, private, cult, and, personal, humiliation, among, the, wealthy, elite, not, subsidised, by, the, roman, state, throughout, his, reign, caligula, seems, to, have, remained, popular, with, the, masses, in, rome, and, the, empire, there, is, no, sound, evidence, that, he, caused, the, removal, replacement, or, imposition, of, roman, or, other, deities, or, even, that, he, threatened, to, do, so, outside, the, hostile, anecdotes, of, his, biographers, barrett, 2015, asserts, that, the, emphatic, and, unequivocal, message, of, the, material, evidence, is, that, caligula, had, no, desire, for, the, world, to, identify, him, as, a, god, even, if, like, most, people, he, enjoyed, being, treated, like, one, he, did, not, demand, worship, as, a, living, god, but, he, permitted, it, when, it, was, offered, imperial, etiquette, and, the, examples, of, augustus, and, tiberius, would, have, him, refuse, divine, honours, but, thank, those, who, offered, them, inferring, their, status, as, equal, to, his, he, seems, to, have, taken, his, own, genius, cult, very, seriously, but, his, fatal, offense, was, to, willfully, insult, or, offend, everyone, who, mattered, including, the, military, officers, who, assassinated, him, on, 24, january, 41, the, day, before, his, due, departure, for, alexandria, caligula, was, assassinated, by, the, praetorian, tribunes, cassius, chaerea, and, cornelius, sabinus, and, a, number, of, centurions, josephus, names, many, of, caligula, s, inner, circle, as, conspirators, and, dio, seems, to, have, had, access, to, a, senatorial, version, which, purported, to, name, many, others, more, likely, very, few, conspirators, would, have, been, involved, and, not, all, need, have, been, directly, in, touch, with, each, other, the, fewer, who, knew, the, greater, the, chance, of, success, previous, attempts, had, foundered, or, faded, out, when, faced, with, the, rewards, and, risks, of, betrayal, by, colleagues, whether, through, torture, fear, of, torture, or, promised, reward, the, senate, was, a, disunited, body, of, self, interested, wealthy, and, mistrustful, aristocrats, unwilling, to, risk, their, own, prospects, and, determined, to, present, a, virtuous, united, front, in, josephus, account, of, caligula, s, assassination, chaerea, was, a, noble, idealist, deeply, committed, to, republican, liberties, he, was, also, motivated, by, resentment, of, caligula, s, routine, personal, insults, and, mockery, suetonius, and, all, other, sources, confirm, that, caligula, had, insulted, chaerea, giving, him, watchwords, like, the, ribald, priapus, or, venus, the, latter, said, to, refer, to, chaerea, s, weak, high, voice, and, either, his, soft, hearted, attitude, when, collecting, taxes, or, his, duty, to, collect, the, tax, on, prostitutes, he, was, also, known, to, do, caligula, s, dirty, work, for, him, including, torture, chaerea, sabinus, and, others, accosted, caligula, as, he, addressed, an, acting, troupe, of, young, men, beneath, the, palace, during, a, series, of, games, and, dramatics, being, held, for, the, divus, augustus, the, source, details, vary, but, all, agree, that, chaerea, was, first, to, stab, caligula, the, narrow, space, available, offered, little, room, for, escape, or, rescue, and, by, the, time, caligula, s, loyal, germanic, guard, could, come, to, his, defence, their, emperor, was, already, dead, they, killed, several, of, caligula, s, party, including, some, innocent, senators, and, bystanders, the, killing, only, stopped, when, the, praetorians, took, control, josephus, reports, that, the, senate, tried, to, use, caligula, s, death, as, an, opportunity, to, restore, the, republic, this, would, have, meant, the, abolition, of, the, office, of, emperor, the, end, of, dynastic, rule, and, restoration, of, the, former, social, stature, and, privilege, of, nobles, and, senators, at, least, one, senator, lucius, annius, vinicianus, seems, to, have, thought, it, an, opportunity, for, a, takeover, some, modern, scholars, believe, he, was, the, conspiracy, s, main, instigator, most, ordinary, citizens, were, taken, aback, by, caligula, s, murder, and, found, no, cause, to, celebrate, in, losing, the, benefits, of, his, rule, almost, all, the, named, conspirators, were, from, the, elite, when, caligula, s, death,

sought, out, and, murdered, caligula, s, wife, caesonia, and, their, young, daughter, julia, drusilla, but, were, unable, to, reach, caligula, s, uncle, claudius, in, the, traditional, account, a, soldier, gratus, found, claudius, hiding, behind, a, palace, curtain, a, sympathetic, faction, of, the, praetorian, guard, smuggled, him, out, to, their, nearby, camp, and, nominated, him, as, emperor, the, senate, faced, with, what, now, seemed, inevitable, confirmed, their, choice, caligula, s, most, powerful, and, universally, feared, adviser, the, freedman, callistus, may, have, engineered, this, succession, having, discreetly, shifted, his, loyalty, from, caligula, to, claudius, while, caligula, lived, the, killing, of, caligula, had, been, extralegal, tantamount, to, regicide, and, those, who, carried, it, out, had, broken, their, oaths, of, loyalty, to, him, claudius, as, a, prospective, replacement, for, caligula, could, acknowledge, his, predecessor, s, failings, but, could, not, be, seen, to, condone, his, murder, or, find, fault, with, the, principate, as, an, institution, caligula, had, been, popular, with, a, clear, majority, of, rome, s, lesser, citizenry, and, the, senate, could, not, afford, to, ignore, the, fact, claudius, appointed, a, new, praetorian, prefect, and, executed, chaerea, a, tribune, named, lupus, and, the, centurions, involved, he, allowed, sabinus, to, commit, suicide, claudius, refused, the, senate, s, requests, to, formally, declare, caligula, hostis, a, public, enemy, or, condemn, his, memory, see, damnatio, memoriae, he, also, turned, down, a, proposal, to, officially, condemn, all, the, caesars, and, destroy, their, temples, caligula, s, name, was, removed, from, the, official, lists, of, oaths, and, dedications, some, inscriptions, were, removed, or, obliterated, most, of, his, statues, had, the, heads, recut, to, resemble, augustus, or, claudius, or, in, one, case, nero, who, would, suffer, a, similar, fate, according, to, suetonius, caligula, s, body, was, placed, under, turf, until, it, was, burned, and, entombed, by, his, sisters, caligula, s, childhood, health, may, have, been, delicate, augustus, appointed, two, physicians, to, accompany, his, journey, north, to, join, his, parents, in, ad, 14, suetonius, connects, this, to, possible, childhood, bouts, of, epilepsy, as, an, adult, he, was, subject, to, fainting, fits, he, was, a, habitually, light, sleeper, prone, to, nodding, off, during, banquets, sleeping, no, more, than, 3, hours, in, any, one, night, and, subject, to, vivid, nightmares, barrett, describes, him, as, nervous, and, highly, strung, when, speaking, in, public, he, would, fidget, and, move, about, overcome, by, the, flood, of, his, own, words, and, ideas, despite, that, he, was, an, eloquent, speaker, he, grew, stronger, with, age, but, was, probably, never, robust, or, athletic, despite, his, practise, as, a, charioteer, little, is, known, of, his, illness, in, 38, nor, what, it, changed, if, anything, but, it, was, a, serious, possibly, life, threatening, event, philo, blames, it, on, caligula, s, habitual, over, indulgence, in, rich, foods, and, wine, general, intemperance, and, a, stress, induced, nervous, breakdown, philo, believed, that, the, illness, removed, caligula, s, pretence, of, decency, and, revealed, his, inner, cruelty, and, ruthlessness, evident, in, the, murders, of, his, own, father, in, law, silanus, and, young, cousin, gemellus, the, sources, are, somewhat, contradictory, on, the, matter, of, caligula, s, sex, life, seneca, claims, that, during, a, public, banquet, he, humiliated, a, close, friend, with, a, loud, first, hand, account, of, his, friend, s, wife, s, disappointing, performance, in, bed, caligula, is, said, to, have, had, enormous, sexual, appetites, several, mistresses, and, male, lovers, but, in, relation, to, the, alleged, perversions, practised, at, corfu, by, tiberius, and, in, some, sources, shared, by, caligula, barrett, finds, him, remarkably, prudish, in, expelling, the, so, called, spintriae, from, the, island, on, his, accession, caligula, s, first, wife, was, junia, claudia, daughter, of, ex, consul, marcus, junius, silanus, like, most, marriages, in, rome, s, upper, echelons, and, perhaps, all, but, one, of, caligula, s, four, marriages, this, was, a, political, alliance, intended, to, produce, a, legitimate, heir, and, further, caligula, s, dynasty, junia, and, her, baby, died, in, child, birth, less, than, a, year, later, soon, after, macro, seems, to, have, persuaded, his, own, wife, ennia, thrasylla, to, take, up, a, sexual, affair, with, caligula, perhaps, to, help, him, through, the, loss, suetonius, and, dio, claim, that, caligula, met, livia, orestilla, at, her, marriage, to, gaius, calpurnius, piso, and, abducted, her, so, that, he, could, marry, her, instead, and, father, a, legitimate, heir, when, she, proved, faithful, to, her, former, husband, caligula, banished, her, the, arval, brethren, s, records, confirm, her, marriage, to, piso, but, under, ordinary, roman, custom, susan, wood, dismisses, caligula, s, marriage, to, her, as, a, drunken, party, stunt, caligula, s, marriage, to, the, beautiful, very, wealthy, and, extravagant, lollia, paulina, was, quickly, followed, by, divorce, on, the, grounds, of, her, infertility, his, fourth, and, last, marriage, to, caesonia, seems, to, have, been, a, love, match, in, which, he, was, both, uxorious, and, monogamous, and, fathered, a, daughter, whom, he, named, julia, drusilla, in, commemoration, of, his, late, sister, caligula, s, contemporaries, could, not, understand, his, attraction, to, caesonia, she, had, proved, herself, fertile, in, previous, marriages, but, also, had, a, reputation, for, high, living, and, low, morals, very, far, from, the, model, of, an, aristocratic, roman, wife, tales, reported, by, josephus, suetonius, and, the, satirist, juvenal, regarding, caligula, s, sexual, dynamism, are, inconsistent, with, rumours, that, caesonia, had, to, arouse, his, interest, with, a, love, potion, which, turned, his, mind, and, brought, on, his, madness, barrett, suggests, that, this, rumour, might, have, had, no, foundation, other, than, caligula, s, quip, that, he, felt, like, torturing, caesonia, to, discover, why, he, loved, her, so, passionately, allegations, of, incest, between, caligula, and, his, sisters, or, just, he, and, his, favourite, drusilla, go, back, no, further, than, suetonius, who, admits, that, in, his, own, time, they, were, hearsay, seneca, and, philo, moralising, contemporaries, of, caligula, do, not, mention, these, stories, even, after, caligula, s, death, when, it, would, have, been, safe, to, do, so, caligula, s, devotion, to, his, youngest, sister, was, evident, but, then, as, now, allegations, of, incest, fit, the, amoral, mad, emperor, stereotype, promiscuous, with, money, sex, and, the, lives, of, his, subjects, dio, repeats, as, fact, the, rumour, that, caligula, also, had, improper, relations, with, his, two, older, sisters, agrippina, and, livilla, there, is, no, reliable, evidence, of, caligula, s, mental, state, at, any, time, in, his, life, had, he, been, thought, truly, insane, his, misdeeds, would, not, have, been, thought, his, fault, winterling, points, out, that, in, roman, law, the, insane, were, not, legally, responsible, for, their, actions, no, matter, how, extreme, responsibility, for, their, control, and, restraint, fell, on, those, around, them, in, the, course, of, their, narratives, all, the, primary, and, contemporary, sources, give, reasons, to, discredit, and, ultimately, condemn, caligula, for, offences, against, proprieties, of, class, religion, or, his, role, as, emperor, thus, his, acts, should, be, seen, from, other, angles, and, the, search, for, mad, caligula, abandoned, barrett, suggests, that, from, a, very, early, age, with, the, loss, of, his, father, then, of, his, mother, and, what, remained, of, his, family, caligula, was, preoccupied, with, his, own, survival, given, near, limitless, powers, to, use, as, he, saw, fit, he, used, them, to, feed, his, sense, of, self, importance, practically, devoid, of, any, sense, of, moral, responsibility, a, man, for, whom, the, tenure, of, the, principate, was, little, more, than, an, opportunity, to, exercise, power, caligula, clearly, had, a, highly, developed, sense, of, the, absurd, resulting, in, a, form, of, humour, that, was, often, cruel, sadistic, and, malicious, and, which, made, its, impact, essentially, by, cleverly, scoring, points, over, those, who, were, in, no, position, to, respond, in, kind, philo, saw, caligula, s, illness, of, 37, as, a, form, of, nervous, collapse, a, response, to, the, extreme, stresses, and, strains, of, imperial, rule, for, which, caligula, was, temperamentally, ill, equipped, philo, josephus, and, seneca, see, caligula, s, apparent, insanity, as, an, underlying, personality, trait, accentuated, through, self, indulgence, and, the, unlimited, exercise, of, power, seneca, acknowledges, that, caligula, s, promotion, to, emperor, seemed, to, make, him, more, arrogant, angry, and, insulting, several, modern, sources, suggest, underlying, medical, conditions, as, explanations, for, some, aspects, of, his, behaviour, and, appearance, they, include, mania, bipolar, disorder, schizophrenia, encephalitis, meningitis, and, epilepsy, the, so, called, falling, sickness, benediktson, refines, suetonius, statement, that, caligula, could, not, swim, to, a, diagnosis, of, interictal, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, and, a, consequent, fear, of, seizures, that, prevented, his, learning, to, swim, in, romano, greek, medical, theory, severe, epilepsy, attacks, were, associated, with, the, full, moon, and, the, moon, goddess, selene, with, whom, caligula, was, claimed, to, converse, and, enjoy, sexual, congress, suetonius, descriptions, of, caligula, as, physically, repulsive, are, neither, reliable, nor, likely, considering, his, ecstatic, and, enthusiastic, reception, as, a, youthful, princeps, by, the, populace, in, the, ancient, world, a, person, s, physique, was, believed, to, be, a, reliable, guide, to, their, character, and, behaviour, most, facts, and, circumstances, of, caligula, s, reign, are, lost, to, history, the, two, most, important, literary, sources, on, caligula, and, his, reign, are, suetonius, a, government, official, of, equestrian, rank, born, around, 70, ad, and, cassius, dio, a, bithynian, senator, who, held, consulships, in, ad, 205, and, 229, suetonius, tends, to, arrange, his, material, thematically, with, little, or, no, chronological, framework, more, biographer, than, historian, dio, provides, a, somewhat, inconsistent, chronology, of, caligula, s, reign, he, dedicates, 13, 21, chapters, to, positive, features, of, caligula, s, reign, but, nearly, 40, to, caligula, as, monster, philo, s, works, on, the, embassy, to, gaius, and, flaccus, give, some, details, on, caligula, s, early, reign, but, more, on, events, involving, jews, in, judea, and, egypt, whose,

experience, under, caligula, could, have, clouded, his, judgment, he, narrowly, avoided, a, death, sentence, in, ad, 39, probably, imposed, for, his, association, with, known, conspirators, caligula, had, a, low, opinion, of, his, literary, style, further, contemporaneous, histories, of, caligula, s, reign, are, attested, by, tacitus, who, describes, them, as, biased, for, or, against, caligula, of, tacitus, own, work, little, of, relevance, to, caligula, survives, but, tacitus, works, testify, to, his, general, hostility, to, the, imperial, system, among, the, known, losses, of, his, works,
