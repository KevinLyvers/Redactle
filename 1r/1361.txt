in, the, preceding, decades, but, had, only, recently, stopped, being, under, the, threat, of, native, american, raids, lexington, was, an, established, town, that, hosted, transylvania, university, the, first, university, west, of, the, appalachian, mountains, having, already, passed, the, virginia, bar, clay, quickly, received, a, kentucky, license, to, practice, law, after, apprenticing, himself, to, kentucky, attorneys, such, as, george, nicholas, john, breckenridge, and, james, brown, clay, established, his, own, law, practice, frequently, working, on, debt, collections, and, land, disputes, clay, soon, established, a, reputation, for, strong, legal, ability, and, courtroom, oratory, in, 1805, he, was, appointed, to, the, faculty, of, transylvania, university, where, he, taught, among, others, future, kentucky, governor, robert, p, letcher, and, robert, todd, the, future, father, in, law, of, abraham, lincoln, clay, s, most, notable, client, was, aaron, burr, who, was, indicted, for, treason, in, the, burr, conspiracy, clay, and, his, law, partner, john, allen, successfully, defended, burr, without, a, fee, in, 1807, thomas, jefferson, later, convinced, clay, that, burr, had, been, guilty, of, the, charges, clay, s, legal, practice, was, light, after, his, election, to, congress, in, the, 1823, case, green, v, biddle, clay, submitted, the, supreme, court, s, first, amicus, curiae, however, he, lost, that, case, clay, entered, politics, shortly, after, arriving, in, kentucky, in, his, first, political, speech, he, attacked, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, laws, passed, by, federalists, to, suppress, dissent, during, the, quasi, war, with, france, like, most, kentuckians, clay, was, a, member, of, the, democratic, republican, party, but, he, clashed, with, state, party, leaders, over, a, state, constitutional, convention, using, the, pseudonym, scaevola, in, reference, to, gaius, mucius, scaevola, clay, advocated, for, direct, elections, for, kentucky, elected, officials, and, the, gradual, emancipation, of, slavery, in, kentucky, the, 1799, kentucky, constitution, included, the, direct, election, of, public, officials, but, the, state, did, not, adopt, clay, s, plan, for, gradual, emancipation, in, 1803, clay, won, election, to, the, kentucky, house, of, representatives, his, first, legislative, initiative, was, the, partisan, gerrymander, of, kentucky, s, electoral, college, districts, which, ensured, that, all, of, kentucky, s, presidential, electors, voted, for, president, jefferson, in, the, 1804, presidential, election, clay, clashed, with, legislators, who, sought, to, reduce, the, power, of, clay, s, bluegrass, region, and, he, unsuccessfully, advocated, moving, the, state, capitol, from, frankfort, to, lexington, clay, frequently, opposed, populist, firebrand, felix, grundy, and, he, helped, defeat, grundy, s, effort, to, revoke, the, banking, privileges, of, the, state, owned, kentucky, insurance, company, he, advocated, for, the, construction, of, internal, improvements, which, would, become, a, consistent, theme, throughout, his, public, career, clay, s, influence, in, kentucky, state, politics, was, such, that, in, 1806, the, kentucky, legislature, elected, him, to, the, united, states, senate, during, his, two, month, tenure, in, the, senate, clay, advocated, for, the, construction, of, various, bridges, and, canals, including, a, canal, connecting, the, chesapeake, bay, and, the, delaware, river, after, clay, returned, to, kentucky, in, 1807, he, was, elected, as, the, speaker, of, the, state, house, of, representatives, that, same, year, in, response, to, attacks, on, american, shipping, by, britain, and, france, during, the, napoleonic, wars, president, jefferson, arranged, passage, of, the, embargo, act, of, 1807, in, support, of, jefferson, s, policy, which, limited, trade, with, foreign, powers, clay, introduced, a, resolution, to, require, legislators, to, wear, homespun, suits, rather, than, those, made, of, imported, british, broadcloth, the, vast, majority, of, members, of, the, state, house, voted, for, the, measure, but, humphrey, marshall, an, aristocratic, lawyer, who, possessed, a, sarcastic, tongue, voted, against, it, in, early, 1809, clay, challenged, marshall, to, a, duel, which, took, place, on, january, 19, while, many, contemporary, duels, were, called, off, or, fought, without, the, intention, of, killing, one, another, both, clay, and, marshall, fought, the, duel, with, the, intent, of, killing, their, opponent, they, each, had, three, turns, to, shoot, both, were, hit, by, bullets, but, both, survived, clay, quickly, recovered, from, his, injury, and, received, only, a, minor, censure, from, the, kentucky, legislature, in, 1810, u, s, senator, buckner, thruston, resigned, to, accept, appointment, to, a, position, as, a, federal, judge, and, clay, was, selected, by, the, legislature, to, fill, thruston, s, seat, clay, quickly, emerged, as, a, fierce, critic, of, british, attacks, on, american, shipping, becoming, part, of, an, informal, group, of, war, hawks, who, favored, expansionist, policies, he, also, advocated, the, annexation, of, west, florida, which, was, controlled, by, spain, on, the, insistence, of, the, kentucky, legislature, clay, helped, prevent, the, re, charter, of, the, first, bank, of, the, united, states, arguing, that, it, interfered, with, state, banks, and, infringed, on, states, rights, after, serving, in, the, senate, for, one, year, clay, decided, that, he, disliked, the, rules, of, the, senate, and, instead, sought, election, to, the, united, states, house, of, representatives, he, won, election, unopposed, in, late, 1810, the, 1810, 1811, elections, produced, many, young, anti, british, members, of, congress, who, like, clay, supported, going, to, war, with, great, britain, buoyed, by, the, support, of, fellow, war, hawks, clay, was, elected, speaker, of, the, house, for, the, 12th, congress, at, 34, he, was, the, youngest, person, to, become, speaker, a, distinction, he, held, until, 1839, when, 30, year, old, robert, m, t, hunter, took, office, he, was, also, the, first, of, only, two, new, members, elected, speaker, to, date, the, other, being, william, pennington, in, 1860, between, 1810, and, 1824, clay, was, elected, to, seven, terms, in, the, house, his, tenure, was, interrupted, from, 1814, to, 1815, when, he, was, a, commissioner, to, peace, talks, with, the, british, in, ghent, united, netherlands, to, end, the, war, of, 1812, and, from, 1821, to, 1823, when, he, left, congress, to, rebuild, his, family, s, fortune, in, the, aftermath, of, the, panic, of, 1819, elected, speaker, six, times, clay, s, cumulative, tenure, in, office, of, 10, years, 196, days, is, the, second, longest, surpassed, only, by, sam, rayburn, as, speaker, clay, wielded, considerable, power, in, making, committee, appointments, and, like, many, of, his, predecessors, he, assigned, his, allies, to, important, committees, clay, was, exceptional, in, his, ability, to, control, the, legislative, agenda, through, well, placed, allies, and, the, establishment, of, new, committees, and, departed, from, precedent, by, frequently, taking, part, in, floor, debates, yet, he, also, gained, a, reputation, for, personal, courteousness, and, fairness, in, his, rulings, and, committee, appointments, clay, s, drive, to, increase, the, power, of, the, office, of, speaker, was, aided, by, president, james, madison, who, deferred, to, congress, in, most, matters, john, randolph, a, member, of, the, democratic, republican, party, but, also, a, member, of, the, tertium, quids, group, that, opposed, many, federal, initiatives, emerged, as, a, prominent, opponent, of, speaker, clay, while, randolph, frequently, attempted, to, obstruct, clay, s, initiatives, clay, became, a, master, of, parliamentary, maneuvers, that, enabled, him, to, advance, his, agenda, even, over, the, attempted, obstruction, by, randolph, and, others, clay, and, other, war, hawks, demanded, that, the, british, revoke, the, orders, in, council, a, series, of, decrees, that, had, resulted, in, a, de, facto, commercial, war, with, the, united, states, though, clay, recognized, the, dangers, inherent, in, fighting, britain, one, of, the, most, powerful, countries, in, the, world, he, saw, it, as, the, only, realistic, alternative, to, a, humiliating, submission, to, british, attacks, on, american, shipping, clay, led, a, successful, effort, in, the, house, to, declare, war, against, britain, complying, with, a, request, from, president, madison, madison, signed, the, declaration, of, war, on, june, 18, 1812, beginning, the, war, of, 1812, during, the, war, clay, frequently, communicated, with, secretary, of, state, james, monroe, and, secretary, of, war, william, eustis, though, he, advocated, for, the, replacement, of, the, latter, the, war, started, poorly, for, the, americans, and, clay, lost, friends, and, relatives, in, the, fighting, in, october, 1813, the, british, asked, madison, to, begin, negotiations, in, europe, and, madison, asked, clay, to, join, his, diplomatic, team, as, the, president, hoped, that, the, presence, of, the, leading, war, hawk, would, ensure, support, for, a, peace, treaty, clay, was, reluctant, to, leave, congress, but, felt, duty, bound, to, accept, the, offer, and, so, he, resigned, from, congress, on, january, 19, 1814, clay, left, the, country, on, february, 25, but, negotiations, with, the, british, did, not, begin, until, august, 1814, clay, was, part, of, a, team, of, five, commissioners, that, included, treasury, secretary, albert, gallatin, senator, james, bayard, ambassador, jonathan, russell, and, ambassador, john, quincy, adams, the, head, of, the, american, team, clay, and, adams, maintained, an, uneasy, relationship, marked, by, frequent, clashes, and, gallatin, emerged, as, the, unofficial, leader, of, the, american, team, when, the, british, finally, presented, their, initial, peace, offer, clay, was, outraged, by, its, terms, especially, the, british, proposal, for, an, indian, barrier, state, on, the, great, lakes, after, a, series, of, american, military, successes, in, 1814, the, british, delegation, made, several, concessions, and, offered, a, better, peace, deal, while, adams, and, gallatin, were, eager, to, make, peace, as, quickly, as, possible, even, if, that, required, sub, optimal, terms, in, the, peace, treaty, clay, believed, that, the, british, worn, down, by, years, of, fighting, against, france, greatly, desired, peace, with, the, united, states, partly, due, to, clay, s, hard, line, stance, the, treaty, of, ghent, included, relatively, favorable, terms, for, the, united, states, essentially, re, establishing, the, status, quo, ante, bellum, between, britain, and, the, u, s, the, treaty, was, signed, on, december, 24, 1814, bringing, a, close, to, the, war, of, 1812, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, clay, briefly, traveled, to, london, where, he, helped, gallatin, negotiate, a, commercial, agreement, with, britain, clay, returned, to, the, united, states, in, september, 1815, despite, his, absence, he, had, been, elected, to, another, term, in, the, house, of, representatives, upon, his, return, to, congress, clay, won, election, as, speaker, of, the, house, the, war, of, 1812, strengthened, clay, s, support, for, interventionist, economic, policies, such, as, federally, funded, internal, improvements, which, he, believed, were, necessary, to, improve, the, country, s, infrastructure, system, he, eagerly, embraced, president, madison, s, ambitious, domestic, package, which, included, infrastructure, investment, tariffs, to, protect, domestic, manufacturing, and, spending, increases, for, the, army, and, navy, with, the, help, of, john, c, calhoun, and, william, lowndes, clay, passed, the, tariff, of, 1816, which, served, the, dual, purpose, of, raising, revenue, and, protecting, american, manufacturing, to, stabilize, the, currency, clay, and, treasury, secretary, alexander, dallas, arranged, passage, of, a, bill, establishing, the, second, bank, of, the, united, states, also, known, as, the, national, bank, clay, also, supported, the, bonus, bill, of, 1817, which, would, have, provided, a, fund, for, internal, improvements, but, madison, vetoed, the, bill, on, constitutional, concerns, beginning, in, 1818, clay, advocated, for, an, economic, plan, known, as, the, american, system, which, encompassed, many, of, the, economic, measures, including, protective, tariffs, and, infrastructure, investments, that, he, helped, pass, in, the, aftermath, of, the, war, of, 1812, like, jefferson, and, george, washington, president, madison, decided, to, retire, after, two, terms, leaving, open, the, democratic, republican, nomination, for, the, 1816, presidential, election, at, the, time, the, democratic, republicans, used, a, congressional, nominating, caucus, to, choose, their, presidential, nominees, giving, congressmen, a, powerful, role, in, the, presidential, selection, process, monroe, and, secretary, of, war, william, crawford, emerged, as, the, two, main, candidates, for, the, democratic, republican, nomination, clay, had, a, favorable, opinion, of, both, individuals, but, he, supported, monroe, who, won, the, nomination, and, went, on, to, defeat, federalist, candidate, rufus, king, in, the, general, election, monroe, offered, clay, the, position, of, secretary, of, war, but, clay, strongly, desired, the, office, of, secretary, of, state, and, was, angered, when, monroe, instead, chose, john, quincy, adams, for, that, position, clay, became, so, bitter, that, he, refused, to, allow, monroe, s, inauguration, to, take, place, in, the, house, chamber, and, subsequently, did, not, attend, monroe, s, outdoor, inauguration, in, early, 1819, a, dispute, erupted, over, the, proposed, statehood, of, missouri, after, new, york, congressman, james, tallmadge, introduced, a, legislative, amendment, that, would, provide, for, the, gradual, emancipation, of, missouri, s, slaves, though, clay, had, previously, called, for, gradual, emancipation, in, kentucky, he, sided, with, the, southerners, in, voting, down, tallmadge, s, amendment, clay, instead, supported, illinois, senator, jesse, b, thomas, s, compromise, proposal, in, which, missouri, would, be, admitted, as, a, slave, state, maine, would, be, admitted, as, a, free, state, and, slavery, would, be, forbidden, in, the, territories, north, of, 36, 30, parallel, clay, helped, assemble, a, coalition, that, passed, the, missouri, compromise, as, thomas, s, proposal, became, known, further, controversy, ensued, when, missouri, s, constitution, banned, free, blacks, from, entering, the, state, but, clay, was, able, to, engineer, another, compromise, that, allowed, missouri, to, join, as, a, state, in, august, 1821, in, foreign, policy, clay, was, a, leading, american, supporter, of, the, independence, movements, and, revolutions, that, broke, out, in, latin, america, beginning, in, 1810, clay, frequently, called, on, the, monroe, administration, to, recognize, the, fledgling, latin, american, republics, but, monroe, feared, that, doing, so, would, derail, his, plans, to, acquire, spanish, florida, in, 1818, general, andrew, jackson, crossed, into, spanish, florida, to, suppress, raids, by, seminole, indians, though, jackson, was, following, monroe, s, implied, wishes, in, entering, florida, he, created, additional, controversy, in, seizing, the, spanish, town, of, pensacola, despite, protests, from, secretary, of, war, calhoun, monroe, and, adams, decided, to, support, jackson, s, actions, in, the, hope, that, they, would, convince, spain, to, sell, florida, clay, however, was, outraged, and, he, publicly, condemned, jackson, s, decision, to, hang, two, foreign, nationals, without, a, trial, before, the, house, chamber, he, compared, jackson, to, military, dictators, of, the, past, telling, his, colleagues, that, greece, had, her, alexander, rome, her, caesar, england, her, cromwell, france, her, bonaparte, and, that, if, we, would, escape, the, rock, on, which, they, split, we, must, avoid, their, errors, jackson, saw, clay, s, protestations, as, an, attack, on, his, character, and, thus, began, a, long, rivalry, between, clay, and, jackson, the, rivalry, and, the, controversy, over, jackson, s, expedition, temporarily, subsided, after, the, signing, of, the, adams, on, s, treaty, in, which, the, u, s, purchased, florida, and, delineated, its, western, boundary, with, new, spain, by, 1822, several, members, of, the, democratic, republican, party, had, begun, exploring, presidential, bids, to, succeed, monroe, who, planned, to, retire, after, two, terms, like, his, predecessors, as, the, federalist, party, was, near, collapse, the, 1824, presidential, election, would, be, contested, only, by, members, of, the, democratic, republican, party, including, clay, having, led, the, passage, of, the, tariff, of, 1824, and, the, general, survey, act, clay, campaigned, on, his, american, system, of, high, tariffs, and, federal, spending, on, infrastructure, three, members, of, monroe, s, cabinet, secretary, of, the, treasury, william, crawford, secretary, of, state, john, quincy, adams, and, secretary, of, war, john, c, calhoun, appeared, to, be, clay, s, strongest, competitors, for, the, presidency, though, many, including, clay, did, not, take, his, candidacy, seriously, at, first, general, andrew, jackson, emerged, as, a, presidential, contender, eroding, clay, s, base, of, support, in, the, western, states, in, february, 1824, the, sparsely, attended, democratic, republican, congressional, caucus, endorsed, crawford, s, candidacy, but, crawford, s, rivals, ignored, the, caucus, results, and, various, state, legislatures, nominated, candidates, for, president, during, the, campaign, crawford, suffered, a, major, stroke, while, calhoun, withdrew, from, the, race, after, jackson, won, the, endorsement, of, the, pennsylvania, legislature, by, 1824, with, crawford, still, in, the, race, clay, concluded, that, no, candidate, would, win, a, majority, of, electoral, votes, in, that, scenario, the, house, of, representatives, would, hold, a, contingent, election, to, decide, the, election, under, the, terms, of, the, twelfth, amendment, the, top, three, electoral, vote, getters, would, be, eligible, to, be, elected, by, the, house, clay, was, confident, that, he, would, prevail, in, a, contingent, held, in, the, chamber, he, presided, over, so, long, as, he, was, eligible, for, election, clay, won, kentucky, ohio, and, missouri, but, his, loss, in, new, york, and, louisiana, relegated, him, to, a, fourth, place, finish, behind, adams, jackson, and, crawford, clay, was, humiliated, that, he, finished, behind, the, invalid, crawford, and, jackson, but, supporters, of, the, three, remaining, presidential, candidates, immediately, began, courting, his, support, for, the, contingent, election, for, various, reasons, supporters, of, all, three, candidates, believed, they, had, the, best, chance, of, winning, clay, s, backing, but, clay, quickly, settled, on, supporting, adams, of, the, three, candidates, adams, was, the, most, sympathetic, to, clay, s, american, system, and, clay, viewed, both, jackson, and, the, sickly, crawford, as, unsuitable, for, the, presidency, on, january, 9, 1825, clay, privately, met, with, adams, for, three, hours, after, which, clay, promised, adams, his, support, both, would, later, claim, that, they, did, not, discuss, clay, s, position, in, an, adams, administration, with, the, help, of, clay, adams, won, the, house, vote, on, the, first, ballot, after, his, election, adams, offered, clay, the, position, of, secretary, of, state, which, clay, accepted, despite, fears, that, he, would, be, accused, of, trading, his, support, for, the, cabinet, post, jackson, was, outraged, by, the, election, and, he, and, his, supporters, accused, clay, and, adams, of, having, reached, a, corrupt, bargain, pro, jackson, forces, immediately, began, preparing, for, the, 1828, presidential, election, with, the, corrupt, bargain, accusation, becoming, their, central, issue, clay, served, as, secretary, of, state, from, 1825, to, 1829, as, secretary, of, state, he, was, the, top, foreign, policy, official, in, the, adams, administration, but, he, also, held, several, domestic, duties, such, as, oversight, of, the, patent, office, clay, came, to, like, adams, a, former, rival, and, to, despise, jackson, they, developed, a, strong, working, relationship, adams, and, clay, were, both, wary, of, forming, entangling, alliances, with, the, emerging, states, and, they, continued, to, uphold, the, monroe, doctrine, which, called, for, european, non, intervention, in, former, colonies, clay, was, rebuffed, in, his, efforts, to, reach, a, commercial, treaty, and, a, settlement, of, the, canada, united, states, border, with, britain, and, was, also, unsuccessful, in, his, attempts, to, make, the, french, pay, for, damages, arising, from, attacks, on, american, shipping, during, the, napoleonic, wars, he, had, more, success, in, negotiating, commercial, treaties, with, latin, american, republics, reaching, most, favoured, nation, trade, agreements, in, an, attempt, to, ensure, that, no, european, country, had, a, trading, advantage, over, the, united, states, seeking, deeper, relations, with, latin, american, countries, clay, strongly, favored, sending, american, delegates, to, the, congress, of, panama, but, his, efforts, were, defeated, by, opponents, in, the, senate, adams, proposed, an, ambitious, domestic, program, based, in, large, part, on, clay, s, american, system, but, clay, warned, the, president, that, many, of, his, proposals, held, little, chance, of, passage, in, the, 19th, congress, adams, s, opponents, defeated, many, of, his, proposals, including, the, establishment, of, a, naval, academy, and, a, national, observatory, but, adams, did, preside, over, the, construction, or, initiation, of, major, infrastructure, projects, like, the, national, road, and, the, chesapeake, and, ohio, canal, followers, of, adams, began, to, call, themselves, national, republicans, and, jackson, s, followers, became, known, as, democrats, both, campaigns, spread, untrue, stories, about, the, opposing, candidates, adams, followers, denounced, jackson, as, a, demagogue, and, some, adams, aligned, papers, accused, jackson, s, wife, rachel, of, bigamy, though, clay, was, not, directly, involved, in, these, attacks, his, failure, to, denounce, them, earned, him, the, lifelong, enmity, of, jackson, clay, was, one, of, adams, s, most, important, political, advisers, but, because, of, his, myriad, responsibilities, as, secretary, of, state, he, was, often, unable, to, take, part, in, campaigning, as, adams, was, averse, to, the, use, of, patronage, for, political, purposes, jackson, s, campaign, enjoyed, a, marked, advantage, in, organization, and, adams, allies, such, as, clay, and, daniel, webster, were, unable, to, create, an, equally, powerful, organization, headed, by, the, president, in, the, 1828, election, jackson, took, 56, of, the, popular, vote, and, won, almost, every, state, outside, of, new, england, clay, was, especially, distressed, by, jackson, s, victory, in, kentucky, the, election, result, represented, not, only, the, victory, of, a, man, clay, viewed, as, unqualified, and, unprincipled, but, also, a, rejection, of, clay, s, domestic, policies, even, with, clay, out, of, office, president, jackson, continued, to, see, clay, as, one, of, his, major, rivals, and, jackson, at, one, point, suspected, clay, of, being, behind, the, petticoat, affair, a, controversy, involving, the, wives, of, his, cabinet, members, clay, strongly, opposed, the, 1830, indian, removal, act, which, authorized, the, administration, to, relocate, native, americans, to, land, west, of, the, mississippi, river, another, key, point, of, contention, between, clay, and, jackson, was, the, proposed, maysville, road, which, would, connect, maysville, kentucky, to, the, national, road, in, zanesville, ohio, transportation, advocates, hoped, that, later, extensions, would, eventually, connect, the, national, road, to, new, orleans, in, 1830, jackson, vetoed, the, project, both, because, he, felt, that, the, road, did, not, constitute, interstate, commerce, and, also, because, he, generally, opposed, using, the, federal, government, to, promote, economic, modernization, while, jackson, s, veto, garnered, support, from, opponents, of, infrastructure, spending, it, damaged, his, base, of, support, in, clay, s, home, state, of, kentucky, clay, returned, to, federal, office, in, 1831, by, winning, election, to, the, senate, over, richard, mentor, johnson, in, a, 73, to, 64, vote, of, the, kentucky, legislature, his, return, to, the, senate, after, 20, years, 8, months, 7, days, out, of, office, marks, the, fourth, longest, gap, in, service, to, the, chamber, in, history, with, the, defeat, of, adams, clay, became, the, de, facto, leader, of, the, national, republicans, and, he, began, making, preparations, for, a, presidential, campaign, in, the, 1832, election, in, 1831, jackson, made, it, clear, that, he, was, going, to, run, for, re, election, ensuring, that, support, or, opposition, to, his, presidency, would, be, a, central, feature, of, the, upcoming, race, jackson, s, democrats, rallied, around, his, policies, towards, the, national, bank, internal, improvements, indian, removal, and, nullification, but, these, policies, also, earned, jackson, various, enemies, including, vice, president, john, c, calhoun, however, clay, rejected, overtures, from, the, fledgling, anti, masonic, party, and, his, attempt, to, convince, calhoun, to, serve, as, his, running, mate, failed, leaving, the, opposition, to, jackson, split, among, different, factions, inspired, by, the, anti, masonic, party, s, national, convention, clay, s, national, republican, followers, arranged, for, a, national, convention, that, nominated, clay, for, president, as, the, 1832, election, approached, the, debate, over, the, re, authorization, of, the, national, bank, emerged, as, the, most, important, issue, in, the, campaign, by, the, early, 1830s, the, national, bank, had, become, the, largest, corporation, in, the, united, states, and, banknotes, issued, by, the, national, bank, served, as, the, de, facto, legal, tender, of, the, united, states, jackson, disliked, the, national, bank, because, of, a, hatred, of, both, banks, and, paper, currency, the, bank, s, charter, did, not, expire, until, 1836, but, bank, president, nicholas, biddle, asked, for, renewal, in, 1831, hoping, that, election, year, pressure, and, support, from, secretary, of, the, treasury, louis, mclane, would, convince, jackson, to, allow, the, re, charter, biddle, s, application, set, off, the, bank, war, congress, passed, a, bill, to, renew, the, national, bank, s, charter, but, jackson, vetoed, it, holding, the, bank, to, be, unconstitutional, clay, had, initially, hoped, that, the, national, bank, re, charter, would, work, to, his, advantage, but, jackson, s, allies, seized, on, the, issue, redefining, the, 1832, election, as, a, choice, between, the, president, and, a, monied, oligarchy, ultimately, clay, was, unable, to, defeat, a, popular, sitting, president, jackson, won, 219, of, the, 286, electoral, votes, and, 54, 2, of, the, popular, vote, carrying, almost, every, state, outside, of, new, england, the, high, rates, of, the, tariff, of, 1828, and, the, tariff, of, 1832, angered, many, southerners, because, they, resulted, in, higher, prices, for, imported, goods, after, the, 1832, election, south, carolina, held, a, state, convention, that, declared, the, tariff, rates, of, 1828, and, 1832, to, be, nullified, within, the, state, and, further, declared, that, federal, collection, of, import, duties, would, be, illegal, after, january, 1833, in, response, to, this, nullification, crisis, jackson, issued, his, proclamation, to, the, people, of, south, carolina, which, strongly, denied, the, right, of, states, to, nullify, federal, laws, or, secede, he, asked, congress, to, pass, what, became, known, as, the, force, bill, which, would, authorize, the, president, to, send, federal, soldiers, against, south, carolina, if, it, sought, to, nullify, federal, law, though, clay, favored, high, tariff, rates, he, found, jackson, s, strong, rhetoric, against, south, carolina, distressing, and, sought, to, avoid, a, crisis, that, could, end, in, civil, war, he, proposed, a, compromise, tariff, bill, that, would, lower, tariff, rates, but, do, so, gradually, thereby, giving, manufacturing, interests, time, to, adapt, to, less, protective, rates, clay, s, compromise, tariff, won, the, backing, of, both, manufacturers, who, believed, they, would, not, receive, a, better, deal, and, calhoun, who, sought, a, way, out, of, the, crisis, but, refused, to, work, with, president, jackson, s, supporters, on, an, alternative, tariff, bill, though, most, members, of, clay, s, own, national, republican, party, opposed, it, the, tariff, of, 1833, passed, both, houses, of, congress, jackson, simultaneously, signed, the, tariff, bill, and, the, force, bill, and, south, carolina, leaders, accepted, the, new, tariff, effectively, bringing, the, crisis, to, an, end, clay, s, role, in, resolving, the, crisis, brought, him, renewed, national, stature, in, the, wake, of, a, crushing, presidential, election, defeat, and, some, began, referring, to, him, as, the, great, compromiser, following, the, end, of, the, nullification, crisis, in, march, 1833, jackson, renewed, his, offensive, against, the, national, bank, despite, some, opposition, from, within, his, own, cabinet, jackson, and, secretary, of, the, treasury, roger, taney, pursued, a, policy, of, removing, all, federal, deposits, from, the, national, bank, and, placing, them, in, state, chartered, banks, known, as, pet, banks, because, federal, law, required, the, president, to, deposit, federal, revenue, in, the, national, bank, so, long, as, it, was, financially, stable, many, regarded, jackson, s, actions, as, illegal, and, clay, led, the, passage, of, a, senate, motion, censuring, jackson, nonetheless, the, national, bank, s, federal, charter, expired, in, 1836, and, though, the, institution, continued, to, function, under, a, pennsylvania, charter, it, never, regained, the, influence, it, had, had, at, the, beginning, of, jackson, s, administration, the, removal, of, deposits, helped, unite, jackson, s, opponents, into, one, party, for, the, first, time, as, national, republicans, calhounites, former, democrats, and, members, of, the, anti, masonic, party, coalesced, into, the, whig, party, the, term, whig, originated, from, a, speech, clay, delivered, in, 1834, in, which, he, compared, opponents, of, jackson, to, the, whigs, a, british, political, party, opposed, to, absolute, monarchy, neither, the, whigs, nor, the, democrats, were, unified, geographically, or, ideologically, however, whigs, tended, to, favor, a, stronger, legislature, a, stronger, federal, government, a, higher, tariff, greater, spending, on, infrastructure, re, authorization, of, the, second, bank, of, the, united, states, and, publicly, funded, education, conversely, democrats, tended, to, favor, a, stronger, president, stronger, state, governments, lower, tariffs, hard, money, and, expansionism, neither, party, took, a, strong, national, stand, on, slavery, the, whig, base, of, support, lay, in, wealthy, businessmen, professionals, the, professional, class, and, large, planters, while, the, democratic, base, of, support, lay, in, immigrant, catholics, and, yeomen, farmers, but, each, party, appealed, across, class, lines, partly, due, to, grief, over, the, death, of, his, daughter, anne, clay, chose, not, to, run, in, the, 1836, presidential, election, and, the, whigs, were, too, disorganized, to, nominate, a, single, candidate, three, whig, candidates, ran, against, van, buren, general, william, henry, harrison, senator, hugh, lawson, white, and, senator, daniel, webster, by, running, multiple, candidates, the, whigs, hoped, to, force, a, contingent, election, in, the, house, of, representatives, clay, personally, preferred, webster, but, he, threw, his, backing, behind, harrison, who, had, the, broadest, appeal, among, voters, clay, s, decision, not, to, endorse, webster, opened, a, rift, between, the, two, whig, party, leaders, and, webster, would, work, against, clay, in, future, presidential, elections, despite, the, presence, of, multiple, whig, candidates, van, buren, won, the, 1836, election, with, 50, 8, percent, of, the, popular, vote, and, 170, of, the, 294, electoral, votes, van, buren, s, presidency, was, affected, badly, by, the, panic, of, 1837, a, major, recession, that, badly, damaged, the, democratic, party, clay, and, other, whigs, argued, that, jackson, s, policies, including, the, use, of, pet, banks, had, encouraged, speculation, and, caused, the, panic, he, promoted, the, american, system, as, a, means, for, economic, recovery, but, president, van, buren, s, response, focused, on, the, practice, of, strict, economy, and, frugality, as, the, 1840, presidential, election, approached, many, expected, that, the, whigs, would, win, control, of, the, presidency, due, to, the, ongoing, economic, crisis, clay, initially, viewed, webster, as, his, strongest, rival, but, clay, harrison, and, general, winfield, scott, emerged, as, the, principal, candidates, at, the, 1839, whig, national, convention, though, he, was, widely, regarded, as, the, most, qualified, whig, leader, to, serve, as, president, many, whigs, questioned, clay, s, electability, after, two, presidential, election, defeats, he, also, faced, opposition, in, the, north, due, to, his, ownership, of, slaves, and, lingering, association, with, the, freemasons, and, in, the, south, from, whigs, who, distrusted, his, moderate, stance, on, slavery, clay, won, a, plurality, on, the, first, ballot, of, the, whig, national, convention, but, with, the, help, of, thurlow, weed, and, other, backers, harrison, consolidated, support, on, subsequent, ballots, and, won, the, whig, presidential, nomination, on, the, fifth, ballot, of, the, convention, seeking, to, placate, clay, s, supporters, and, to, balance, the, ticket, geographically, the, convention, chose, former, virginia, governor, and, senator, john, tyler, a, personal, friend, of, clay, whose, previous, career, in, the, democratic, party, had, practically, come, to, an, end, as, the, vice, presidential, nominee, clay, was, disappointed, by, the, outcome, but, helped, harrison, s, ultimately, successful, campaign, by, delivering, numerous, speeches, with, whigs, also, winning, control, of, congress, in, the, 1840, elections, clay, saw, the, upcoming, 27th, congress, as, an, opportunity, for, the, whig, party, to, establish, itself, as, the, dominant, political, party, by, leading, the, country, out, of, recession, president, elect, harrison, asked, clay, to, serve, another, term, as, secretary, of, state, but, clay, chose, to, remain, in, congress, webster, was, instead, chosen, as, secretary, of, state, while, john, j, crittenden, a, close, ally, of, clay, was, chosen, as, attorney, general, as, harrison, prepared, to, take, office, clay, and, harrison, clashed, over, the, leadership, of, the, whig, party, with, harrison, sensitive, to, accusations, that, he, would, answer, to, clay, just, a, month, into, his, presidency, harrison, died, of, an, illness, and, was, succeeded, by, vice, president, john, tyler, tyler, retained, harrison, s, cabinet, but, the, former, democrat, and, avid, follower, of, both, jefferson, s, and, jackson, s, philosophy, quickly, made, it, known, that, he, had, reservations, about, re, establishing, a, national, bank, a, key, priority, of, clay, s, clay, nonetheless, initially, expected, that, tyler, would, approve, the, measures, passed, by, the, whig, controlled, congress, his, priorities, included, the, re, establishment, of, the, national, bank, higher, tariff, rates, a, national, bankruptcy, law, and, an, act, to, distribute, the, proceeds, of, land, sales, to, the, states, for, investments, in, infrastructure, and, education, clay, and, his, congressional, allies, attempted, to, craft, a, national, bank, bill, acceptable, to, tyler, but, tyler, vetoed, two, separate, bills, to, re, establish, the, national, bank, showing, that, he, in, fact, had, no, will, to, reach, a, solution, for, the, party, s, issues, clay, and, other, whig, leaders, were, now, outraged, not, only, by, tyler, s, rejection, of, the, whig, party, platform, but, also, because, they, felt, that, tyler, had, purposely, misled, them, into, thinking, that, he, would, sign, the, bills, after, the, second, veto, congressional, whigs, voted, to, expel, tyler, from, the, party, and, on, clay, s, request, every, cabinet, member, except, for, webster, who, wanted, to, continue, negotiating, the, webster, ashburton, treaty, with, great, britain, about, the, border, to, canada, resigned, from, office, this, made, tyler, increasingly, move, closer, to, his, former, democratic, party, and, with, webster, still, serving, in, the, tyler, administration, clay, emerged, as, the, clear, leader, of, the, whig, party, in, early, 1842, clay, resigned, from, the, senate, after, arranging, for, crittenden, to, succeed, him, though, he, vetoed, other, whig, bills, tyler, did, sign, some, whig, priorities, into, law, including, the, preemption, act, of, 1841, which, distributed, the, proceeds, of, land, sales, to, the, states, and, the, bankruptcy, act, of, 1841, which, was, the, first, law, in, u, s, history, that, allowed, for, voluntary, bankruptcy, facing, a, large, budget, deficit, tyler, also, signed, the, tariff, of, 1842, which, restored, the, protective, rates, of, the, tariff, of, 1832, but, ended, the, distribution, policy, that, had, been, established, with, the, preemption, act, of, 1841, president, tyler, s, break, with, the, whig, party, combined, with, webster, s, continuing, affiliation, with, tyler, positioned, clay, as, the, leading, contender, for, the, whig, nomination, in, the, 1844, presidential, election, by, 1842, most, observers, believed, that, clay, would, face, van, buren, in, the, 1844, presidential, election, as, he, had, still, remained, as, the, clear, leader, of, the, democrats, and, following, the, tradition, of, the, founders, wanted, a, second, term, hoping, to, win, another, term, president, tyler, forged, an, alliance, with, john, c, calhoun, and, pursued, the, annexation, of, the, republic, of, texas, which, would, add, another, slave, state, to, the, union, after, president, tyler, concluded, an, annexation, treaty, with, texas, clay, announced, his, opposition, to, annexation, he, argued, that, the, country, needed, union, peace, and, patience, and, annexation, would, bring, tensions, over, slavery, and, war, with, mexico, the, same, day, that, clay, published, a, letter, opposing, the, annexation, of, texas, van, buren, also, came, out, against, annexation, citing, similar, reasons, as, clay, so, that, slavery, and, especially, expansionism, seemed, to, play, no, role, in, the, next, election, clay, unanimously, won, the, presidential, nomination, at, the, 1844, whig, national, convention, but, a, minority, of, expansionist, southern, democrats, encouraged, by, tyler, s, alternative, outline, blocked, van, buren, s, nomination, at, the, 1844, democratic, national, convention, for, countless, ballots, until, van, buren, withdrew, making, place, for, an, unexpected, compromise, candidate, the, party, nominated, former, speaker, of, the, house, james, k, polk, of, tennessee, who, favored, annexation, but, in, order, to, calm, anti, expansionists, promised, to, just, run, for, a, single, term, following, the, nomination, of, a, pro, annexation, democrat, tyler, soon, ended, his, incipient, independent, run, for, president, and, endorsed, polk, clay, was, surprised, by, van, buren, s, defeat, but, remained, confident, of, his, chances, in, the, 1844, election, polk, was, the, first, dark, horse, presidential, nominee, in, u, s, history, and, whigs, mocked, him, as, a, fourth, rate, politician, despite, his, relative, lack, of, national, stature, polk, proved, to, be, a, strong, candidate, capable, of, uniting, the, factions, of, the, democratic, party, and, winning, the, support, of, southerners, who, had, been, reluctant, to, support, van, buren, clay, s, stance, on, slavery, alienated, some, voters, in, both, the, north, and, the, south, pro, slavery, southerners, flocked, to, polk, while, many, northern, abolitionists, who, tended, to, align, with, the, whig, party, favored, james, g, birney, of, the, liberty, party, clay, s, opposition, to, annexation, damaged, his, campaign, in, the, south, as, democrats, argued, that, he, worked, in, unison, with, northerners, to, stop, the, extension, of, slavery, in, july, clay, wrote, two, letters, in, which, he, attempted, to, clarify, his, position, on, the, annexation, of, texas, and, democrats, attacked, his, supposedly, inconsistent, position, polk, narrowly, won, the, election, taking, 49, 5, of, the, popular, vote, and, 170, of, the, 275, electoral, votes, birney, won, several, thousand, anti, annexation, votes, in, new, york, and, his, presence, in, the, race, may, have, cost, clay, the, election, most, of, clay, s, contemporaries, believed, that, annexation, had, been, the, decisive, issue, in, the, race, but, polk, s, savvy, campaigning, on, the, tariff, may, have, also, been, decisive, as, he, narrowly, won, pro, tariff, pennsylvania, after, downplaying, his, anti, tariff, views, after, polk, s, victory, and, the, final, indirect, success, of, tyler, s, strategy, congress, approved, the, annexation, of, texas, which, was, signed, by, tyler, on, his, last, day, in, office, and, texas, gained, statehood, in, late, 1845, after, the, 1844, election, clay, returned, to, his, career, as, an, attorney, though, he, was, no, longer, a, member, of, congress, he, remained, closely, interested, in, national, politics, in, 1846, the, mexican, american, war, broke, out, after, american, and, mexican, forces, clashed, at, the, disputed, border, region, between, mexico, and, texas, initially, clay, did, not, publicly, oppose, the, war, but, privately, he, saw, it, as, an, immoral, war, that, risked, producing, some, military, chieftain, who, will, conquer, us, all, he, suffered, a, personal, blow, in, 1847, when, his, son, henry, clay, jr, died, at, the, battle, of, buena, vista, in, november, 1847, clay, re, emerged, on, the, political, scene, with, a, speech, that, was, harshly, critical, of, the, mexican, american, war, and, president, polk, he, attacked, polk, for, fomenting, the, conflict, with, mexico, and, urged, the, rejection, of, any, treaty, that, added, new, slave, territory, to, the, united, states, months, after, the, speech, the, senate, ratified, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, in, which, mexico, ceded, hundreds, of, thousands, of, square, miles, of, territory, known, as, the, mexican, cession, by, 1847, general, zachary, taylor, who, commanded, the, american, forces, at, buena, vista, had, emerged, as, a, contender, for, the, whig, nomination, in, the, 1848, presidential, election, despite, taylor, s, largely, unknown, political, views, many, whigs, believed, he, was, the, party, s, strongest, possible, candidate, due, to, his, martial, accomplishments, in, the, mexican, american, war, one, of, clay, s, most, trusted, allies, and, advisers, john, j, crittenden, was, taylor, s, de, facto, campaign, manager, clay, had, initially, told, his, allies, that, he, would, not, run, in, the, 1848, presidential, election, but, he, was, unwilling, to, support, taylor, a, mere, military, man, on, april, 10, 1848, he, announced, his, candidacy, for, the, whig, nomination, although, webster, and, winfield, scott, each, commanded, a, limited, base, of, support, in, the, party, taylor, and, clay, each, saw, the, other, as, their, lone, serious, rival, for, the, whig, nomination, as, taylor, commanded, the, support, of, most, southern, whigs, clay, focused, his, efforts, on, courting, northern, whigs, emphasizing, his, opposition, to, the, mexican, american, war, and, his, life, long, support, for, the, gradual, emancipation, of, slaves, in, kentucky, clay, presented, a, strong, challenge, to, taylor, at, the, 1848, whig, national, convention, but, taylor, won, the, presidential, nomination, on, the, fourth, ballot, partially, in, an, attempt, to, please, the, clay, wing, of, the, party, the, convention, nominated, millard, fillmore, as, taylor, s, running, mate, clay, was, embittered, by, his, failure, at, the, convention, and, he, did, not, campaign, on, behalf, of, taylor, nonetheless, taylor, won, the, election, taking, 47, 3, percent, of, the, popular, vote, and, 163, of, 290, electoral, votes, increasingly, worried, about, the, sectional, tensions, arising, over, the, issue, of, slavery, in, newly, acquired, territories, clay, accepted, election, to, the, senate, in, 1849, having, refused, to, campaign, for, taylor, clay, played, little, role, in, the, formation, of, taylor, s, cabinet, or, in, determining, the, new, administration, s, policies, in, january, 1850, with, congress, still, deadlocked, regarding, the, status, of, the, mexican, cession, clay, proposed, a, compromise, designed, to, organize, territory, acquired, in, the, mexican, american, war, and, address, other, issues, contributing, to, sectional, tensions, his, legislative, package, included, the, admission, of, california, as, a, free, state, the, cession, by, texas, of, some, of, its, northern, and, western, territorial, claims, in, return, for, debt, relief, the, establishment, of, new, mexico, and, utah, territories, a, ban, on, the, importation, of, slaves, into, the, district, of, columbia, for, sale, and, a, more, stringent, fugitive, slave, law, though, it, faced, opposition, from, southern, extremists, like, calhoun, and, northern, abolitionists, like, william, seward, clay, s, proposal, won, the, backing, of, many, southern, and, northern, leaders, president, taylor, who, favored, the, immediate, admission, of, california, and, new, mexico, as, free, states, without, any, attached, conditions, opposed, the, plan, and, clay, openly, broke, with, the, president, in, may, 1850, debate, over, clay, s, proposal, continued, into, july, when, taylor, unexpectedly, died, of, an, illness, after, taylor, s, death, president, fillmore, who, supported, clay, s, compromise, bill, consulted, with, clay, in, appointing, a, new, cabinet, exhausted, by, the, debate, in, the, senate, clay, took, a, leave, of, absence, shortly, after, taylor, s, death, but, fillmore, webster, and, democratic, senator, stephen, a, douglas, took, charge, of, pro, compromise, forces, by, the, end, of, september, 1850, clay, s, proposal, which, became, known, as, the, compromise, of, 1850, had, been, enacted, though, contemporaries, credited, fillmore, douglas, and, webster, for, their, role, in, passing, the, compromise, of, 1850, clay, was, widely, regarded, as, the, key, figure, in, ending, a, major, sectional, crisis, in, december, 1851, at, the, age, of, 74, with, his, health, declining, clay, announced, that, he, would, resign, from, the, senate, the, following, september, clay, never, recovered, from, his, illnesses, and, died, of, tuberculosis, aged, 75, in, his, room, at, the, national, hotel, in, washington, d, c, on, june, 29, 1852, he, was, the, first, person, to, lie, in, state, in, the, united, states, capitol, rotunda, clay, s, headstone, reads, i, know, no, north, no, south, no, east, no, west, hymn, writer, fanny, crosby, penned, this, line, of, lament, on, clay, s, death, sleep, on, oh, statesman, sleep, within, thy, hallowed, tomb, where, pearly, streamlets, glide, and, summer, roses, bloom, throughout, most, of, his, political, life, clay, promoted, his, american, system, as, both, an, economic, program, and, a, means, for, unifying, the, country, clay, s, american, system, rejected, strict, constructionism, in, favor, of, an, activist, government, that, would, promote, industry, and, commerce, the, american, system, had, four, key, tenets, high, tariffs, a, stable, financial, system, federal, investment, in, internal, improvements, and, a, public, land, sale, policy, designed, to, raise, revenue, and, provide, for, carefully, managed, expansion, into, the, american, frontier, through, high, tariffs, clay, hoped, to, free, the, united, states, from, dependence, on, foreign, imports, especially, from, britain, clay, sought, to, ensure, a, stable, financial, system, through, support, for, the, national, bank, which, regulated, the, country, s, banking, system, and, helped, ensure, a, consistent, supply, of, credit, clay, s, support, for, federally, financed, internal, improvements, stemmed, from, his, belief, that, only, the, federal, government, could, construct, the, transportation, system, necessary, for, uniting, the, country, commercially, and, culturally, his, land, policy, focused, on, using, federal, revenue, from, land, sales, to, fund, states, investments, in, education, infrastructure, projects, and, other, priorities, clay, inherited, slaves, as, a, young, child, and, he, continued, to, own, slaves, throughout, his, life, however, in, the, 1790s, he, adopted, antislavery, views, under, the, influence, of, his, mentor, founding, father, george, wythe, who, emancipated, his, own, human, property, like, most, of, his, contemporaries, clay, was, not, a, racial, egalitarian, and, never, called, for, the, immediate, abolition, of, slavery, but, he, viewed, slavery, as, a, grievous, wrong, to, the, slave, and, spoke, in, favor, of, equal, treatment, for, free, blacks, early, in, his, career, clay, favored, gradual, emancipation, in, both, kentucky, and, missouri, but, each, state, rejected, plans, that, would, have, provided, for, gradual, emancipation, clay, continued, to, support, gradual, emancipation, throughout, his, career, and, published, an, open, letter, in, 1849, calling, for, gradual, emancipation, in, kentucky, though, he, qualified, this, view, by, stating, he, would, only, support, emancipation, if, it, included, a, plan, for, colonizing, free, blacks, outside, of, the, state, unlike, many, other, southern, leaders, he, consistently, favored, recognition, of, haiti, which, had, been, established, through, a, slave, revolt, in, 1816, clay, helped, establish, the, american, colonization, society, a, group, that, wanted, to, establish, a, colony, for, free, american, blacks, in, africa, the, group, was, made, up, of, abolitionists, who, wanted, to, end, slavery, and, slaveholders, who, wanted, to, deport, free, blacks, clay, s, support, for, colonization, reflected, his, belief, that, a, multiracial, society, was, ultimately, unworkable, both, for, whites, and, free, blacks, under, clay, s, plan, all, enslaved, children, born, after, 1860, would, be, freed, at, age, 25, at, that, time, they, were, to, work, for, three, years, in, order, to, finance, their, own, importation, during, this, period, enslavers, could, still, sell, or, mortgage, their, human, property, some, abolitionists, did, not, view, this, plan, favorably, in, 1849, frederick, douglass, denounced, this, plan, in, a, speech, to, the, new, england, anti, slavery, society, at, faneuil, hall, he, objected, to, the, three, years, when, the, enslaved, were, in, jeopardy, as, they, were, still, held, as, property, the, date, of, 1860, would, lead, to, family, separations, as, those, born, before, 1860, would, remain, enslaved, and, those, born, after, were, subjected, to, a, mandatory, importation, those, gathered, first, applauded, at, the, mention, of, henry, clay, however, once, douglass, made, these, points, those, gathered, change, their, response, to, hisses, and, cries, of, shame, later, in, his, career, clay, became, increasingly, concerned, about, abolitionism, remarking, that, the, ultraism, of, the, south, on, the, one, hand, and, the, ultraism, of, abolition, on, the, other, represented, the, greatest, threat, to, the, union, nonetheless, he, consistently, defended, the, right, of, abolitionists, to, send, materials, through, the, mail, and, opposed, the, gag, rule, which, limited, congressional, debate, on, slavery, on, his, 600, acre, plantation, there, were, 122, slaves, held, over, the, course, of, his, life, clay, s, status, as, a, slave, owner, and, his, anti, slavery, views, occasionally, led, to, conflicts, in, his, political, career, during, a, visit, to, indiana, in, the, 1840s, clay, was, confronted, at, a, political, meeting, by, a, quaker, abolitionist, hiram, mendenhall, who, presented, clay, with, a, petition, calling, on, him, to, free, his, slaves, clay, dismissed, mendenhall, out, of, hand, stating, that, the, petition, was, no, different, from, if, it, demanded, he, give, up, his, farm, many, of, his, contemporaries, including, anti, slavery, activist, james, g, birney, believed, that, clay, s, home, state, of, kentucky, had, the, laws, most, permissive, to, slaves, of, any, slave, state, clay, considered, himself, to, be, a, good, master, biographer, james, c, klotter, concludes, that, clay, took, actions, such, as, keeping, families, together, to, mitigate, the, harshness, of, slavery, however, showing, the, opposite, is, his, treatment, of, the, family, of, lewis, hayden, klotter, also, states, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, clay, ever, had, sex, with, any, of, his, slaves, other, sources, state, quite, the, contrary, of, his, punitive, and, sexual, practices, in, 1844, clay, s, wife, discovered, that, he, was, having, relations, with, the, yellow, girl, that, attended, his, poultry, and, fowls, the, young, woman, and, her, children, were, then, sent, to, louisiana, to, be, sold, while, in, washington, dc, clay, acquired, an, octoroon, to, serve, as, concubine, phoebe, moore, age, 16, was, purchased, by, henry, clay, from, his, wife, s, cousin, senator, thomas, hart, benton, according, to, her, obituary, in, new, orleans, times, picayune, when, he, was, in, washington, she, resided, with, clay, in, his, washington, home, and, bore, him, two, children, after, he, emancipated, her, she, moved, to, memphis, tennessee, regarding, keeping, families, together, clay, applied, the, opposite, to, the, family, of, lewis, hayden, in, about, 1836, clay, had, an, enslaved, mother, esther, harvey, and, her, son, sold, south, they, were, the, family, of, lewis, hayden, a, waiter, at, the, upscale, phoenix, hotel, in, about, 1842, hayden, was, threatened, also, by, clay, with, the, sale, of, his, second, wife, harriet, bell, hayden, and, her, son, joseph, who, he, had, adopted, hayden, secured, the, aid, of, vermont, resident, delia, webster, and, oberlin, college, student, rev, calvin, fairbank, through, the, assistance, of, john, mifflin, ame, minister, and, resident, of, oberlin, ohio, they, crafted, a, successful, escape, plan, via, the, underground, railroad, through, maysville, kentucky, across, the, ohio, river, to, the, free, states, of, ohio, and, michigan, the, haydens, became, residents, of, amherstburg, ontario, canada, on, january, 4, 1845, webster, received, a, sentence, of, two, years, hard, labor, for, her, part, in, the, escape, she, was, pardoned, on, february, 24, 1845, also, during, february, fairbank, was, sentenced, to, 15, years, the, kentucky, governor, pardoned, him, in, 1849, however, he, was, imprisoned, again, in, 1852, and, served, 12, years, for, aiding, in, another, escape, another, example, is, lewis, richardson, clay, s, self, emancipated, slave, he, gave, a, speech, that, belies, clay, s, self, portrayal, as, a, good, master, richardson, had, been, enslaved, at, ashland, for, 20, years, and, after, a, beating, escaped, via, the, underground, railroad, in, january, 1846, by, may, of, that, year, richardson, was, also, living, in, amherstburg, ontario, in, a, speech, he, gave, at, union, chapel, there, he, told, not, only, of, continual, sparse, food, and, lack, of, warm, clothing, but, of, 150, lashes, from, overseer, ambrose, brice, for, the, offense, of, being, an, hour, late, returning, from, a, visit, to, his, wife, brice, later, denied, this, claim, stating, it, was, 16, lashes, and, the, offense, was, drunkenness, clay, was, away, on, business, when, this, occurred, richardson, s, speech, was, published, in, an, abolitionist, newspaper, signal, of, liberty, the, text, of, his, speech, is, available, at, the, following, reference, in, 1829, charlotte, dupuy, who, was, enslaved, by, clay, sued, for, her, freedom, while, visiting, relatives, in, maryland, dupuy, s, attorney, gained, an, order, from, the, court, for, her, to, remain, in, washington, until, the, case, was, settled, and, she, worked, for, wages, for, 18, months, for, martin, van, buren, clay, s, successor, as, secretary, of, state, the, case, embarrassed, clay, politically, and, personally, but, he, ultimately, prevailed, in, court, after, winning, the, case, clay, sent, dupuy, to, new, orleans, causing, her, to, be, away, from, her, own, family, but, he, later, freed, dupuy, and, two, of, her, children, aaron, dupuy, charlotte, s, husband, was, ordered, by, clay, to, be, whipped, at, the, behest, of, clay, s, wife, lucretia, dupuy, s, infraction, was, a, late, return, as, lucretia, s, carriage, driver, the, overseer, attempted, the, whipping, but, dupuy, managed, to, wrest, the, whip, away, and, began, beating, the, overseer, he, was, not, freed, at, the, time, of, clay, s, death, but, became, freed, after, the, civil, war, clay, himself, wrote, here, in, kentucky, slavery, is, in, its, most, mitigated, form, still, it, is, slavery, clay, s, will, provided, for, the, gradual, emancipation, of, the, slaves, he, held, at, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1852, aaron, dupuy, was, an, exception, clay, also, stipulated, that, several, of, those, slaves, were, bequeathed, to, his, son, john, clay, s, whig, party, collapsed, four, years, after, his, death, but, clay, cast, a, long, shadow, over, the, generation, of, political, leaders, that, presided, over, the, civil, war, mississippi, senator, henry, s, foote, stated, his, opinion, that, had, there, been, one, such, man, in, the, congress, of, the, united, states, as, henry, clay, in, 1860, 1861, there, would, i, feel, sure, have, been, no, civil, war, clay, s, protege, and, fellow, kentuckian, john, j, crittenden, attempted, to, keep, the, union, together, with, the, formation, of, the, constitutional, union, party, and, the, proposed, crittenden, compromise, though, crittenden, s, efforts, were, unsuccessful, kentucky, remained, in, the, union, during, the, civil, war, reflecting, in, part, clay, s, continuing, influence, abraham, lincoln, was, a, great, admirer, of, clay, saying, he, was, my, ideal, of, a, great, man, lincoln, wholeheartedly, supported, clay, s, economic, programs, and, prior, to, the, civil, war, held, similar, stances, about, slavery, and, the, union, some, historians, have, argued, that, a, clay, victory, in, the, 1844, election, would, have, prevented, both, the, mexican, american, war, and, the, american, civil, war, clay, is, generally, regarded, as, one, of, the, important, political, figures, of, his, era, most, historians, and, political, scientists, consider, clay, to, be, one, of, the, most, influential, speakers, of, the, house, in, u, s, history, in, 1957, a, senate, committee, selected, clay, as, one, of, the, five, greatest, u, s, senators, along, with, daniel, webster, john, c, calhoun, robert, la, follette, and, robert, a, taft, a, 1986, survey, of, historians, ranked, clay, as, the, greatest, senator, in, u, s, history, while, a, 2006, survey, of, historians, ranked, clay, as, the, 31st, most, influential, american, of, all, time, a, 1998, poll, of, historians, ranked, clay, as, the, most, qualified, unsuccessful, major, party, presidential, nominee, in, u, s, history, in, 2015, political, scientist, michael, g, miller, and, historian, ken, owen, ranked, clay, as, one, of, the, four, most, influential, american, politicians, who, never, served, as, president, alongside, alexander, hamilton, william, jennings, bryan, and, john, c, calhoun, noting, clay, s, influence, over, the, united, states, in, the, last, three, decades, of, his, life, biographer, james, klotter, writes, that, perhaps, posterity, should, no, longer, call, it, the, jacksonian, era, and, instead, term, it, the, clay, era, many, monuments, memorials, and, even, high, schools, have, been, erected, and, named, in, honor, of, clay, sixteen, counties, one, each, in, alabama, florida, georgia, illinois, indiana, kansas, kentucky,
