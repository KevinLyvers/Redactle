1934, she, danced, as, a, snowflake, in, the, nutcracker, still, using, the, name, fontes, although, hookham, s, mother, had, written, to, her, fontes, relatives, requesting, their, permission, for, her, daughter, to, use, the, name, for, her, stage, career, the, final, response, was, no, possibly, due, to, the, family, s, wish, to, avoid, an, association, with, a, theatrical, performer, hilda, and, her, daughter, subsequently, looked, up, variations, of, fontes, in, the, telephone, directory, choosing, the, more, british, sounding, fontene, and, adding, a, twist, to, make, it, fonteyn, the, following, year, she, took, the, name, by, which, she, was, known, for, the, remainder, of, her, professional, life, margot, fonteyn, modifying, her, maternal, grandfather, s, surname, fontes, in,

of, the, bride, in, his, choreography, of, stravinsky, s, le, baiser, de, la, f, e, specifically, for, her, though, he, appreciated, her, lyric, qualities, and, found, her, elegant, ashton, said, of, her, early, years, that, fonteyn, had, brittle, stubbornness, and, lacked, polish, in, spite, of, her, perceived, shortcomings, he, cast, her, as, the, lead, playing, the, creole, girl, in, his, production, rio, grande, when, alicia, markova, the, first, prima, ballerina, of, the, company, left, the, vic, wells, later, in, 1935, fonteyn, shared, the, lead, with, other, members, of, the,

advantage, sir, frederick, often, cast, her, as, a, frail, or, otherworldly, being, in, 1936, she, was, cast, as, the, unattainable, muse, in, his, apparitions, a, role, which, consolidated, her, partnership, with, robert, helpmann, and, the, same, year, played, a, wistful, poverty, stricken, flower, seller, in, nocturne, her, success, in, nocturne, marked, a, turning, point, in, ashton, s, perception, of, fonteyn, and, he, recognized, that, she, could, become, the, heir, to, markova, as, lead, dancer, for, the, company, shortly, afterwards, the, company, began, experimenting, with,

performing, the, polka, from, fa, ade, although, the, dancers, enjoyed, these, engagements, the, tiny, television, screens, with, their, unsteady, blue, pictures, meant, that, the, medium, was, not, yet, sophisticated, enough, to, become, a, lucrative, avenue, for, the, company, the, following, year, fonteyn, was, given, the, comic, role, of, julia, in, a, wedding, bouquet, and, was, cast, with, robert, helpmann, performing, the, pas, de, deux, imitating, victorian, ice, skaters, in, ashton, s, les, patineurs, helpmann, was, her, most, constant, partner, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, helping,

become, her, husband, fonteyn, became, enamored, with, arias, after, seeing, him, perform, a, rumba, dance, at, a, party, the, pair, enjoyed, their, time, together, for, the, next, week, but, arias, then, returned, to, panama, for, the, summer, holidays, his, lack, of, subsequent, communication, left, fonteyn, despondent, by, 1939, fonteyn, had, performed, the, principal, roles, in, giselle,

had, been, a, turning, point, in, her, career, convincing, critics, and, audiences, that, a, british, ballerina, could, successfully, dance, the, lead, role, in, a, full, length, classical, russian, ballet, the, reviewer, arnold, haskell, wrote, that, never, before, had, fonteyn, s, performance, been, so, regal, in, manner, or, half, so, brilliant, while, the, writer, tangye, lean, commented,

entertain, troops, with, such, a, heavy, schedule, the, dancers, were, frequently, obliged, to, complete, three, to, four, times, their, usual, weekly, number, of, appearances, fonteyn, later, recalled, dancing, so, often, that, she, sometimes, stood, trembling, in, the, wings, unable, to, remember, if, i, had, finished, my, solo, before, i, left, the, stage, wartime, drafts, meant, that, the, company, lost, many, of, its, male, dancers, to, the, armed, forces, shows, had, to, be, carefully, chosen, or, edited, to, help, ensure, that, an, almost, entirely, female, cast, could, perform, all, the, roles, fonteyn, was, often, paired, with, young, inexperienced, male, dancers, pulled, straight, from, ballet, schools, with, short, london, seasons, they, also, travelled, abroad, and, were, in, the, netherlands, when, it, was, invaded, in, may, 1940, escaping, back, to, england, with, nothing, more, than, the, costumes, they, were, wearing, in, september, 1940, as, the, london,

biographer, meredith, daneman, that, she, underwent, an, abortion, her, relationship, with, lambert, had, grown, difficult, as, he, was, drinking, heavily, and, having, affairs, with, other, women, concerned, about, her, daughter, s, welfare, fonteyn, s, mother, took, matters, into, her, own, hands, gently, encouraging, her, daughter, to, move, on, from, lambert, by, setting, her, up, with,

cutting, up, and, re, purposing, old, opera, costumes, furs, and, even, velvet, curtains, to, create, a, lavish, production, in, contrast, to, most, russian, dancers, who, traditionally, learned, roles, from, previous, generations, of, dancers, fonteyn, had, no, such, living, references, readily, available, to, teach, her, the, role, of, aurora, and, was, obliged, to, create, her, own, interpretation, the, ballet, became, a, signature, production, for, the, company, and, a, distinguishing, role, for, fonteyn, marking, her, arrival, as, the, brightest, crown, of, the, sadler, s,
