fran, ois, rabelais, uk, r, b, l, e, rab, lay, us, r, b, l, e, lay, french, born, between, 1483, and, 1494, died, 1553, was, a, french, writer, who, has, been, called, the, first, great, french, prose, author, a, humanist, of, the, french, renaissance, and, greek, scholar, he, attracted, opposition, from, both, protestant, theologian, john, calvin, and, from, the, hierarchy, of, the, catholic, church, though, in, his, day, he, was, best, known, as, a, physician, scholar, diplomat, and, catholic, priest, later, he, became, better, known, as, a, satirist, for, his, depictions, of, the, grotesque, and, for, his, larger, than, life, characters, both, ecclesiastical, and, anticlerical, christian, and, a, freethinker, a, doctor, and, a, bon, vivant, the, multiple, facets, of, his, personality, sometimes, seem, contradictory, caught, up, in, the, religious, and, political, turmoil, of, the, reformation, rabelais, treated, the, great, questions, of, his, time, in, his, novels, assessments, of, his, life, and, work, have, evolved, over, time, depending, on, dominant, paradigms, of, thought, rabelais, admired, erasmus, and, like, him, is, considered, a, christian, humanist, he, was, critical, of, medieval, scholasticism, lampooning, the, abuses, of, powerful, princes, and, popes, opposing, them, with, greco, roman, learning, and, popular, culture, rabelais, is, widely, known, for, the, first, two, volumes, relating, the, childhoods, of, the, giants, gargantua, and, pantagruel, written, in, the, style, of, bildungsroman, his, later, works, the, third, book, which, prefigures, the, philosophical, novel, and, the, fourth, book, are, considerably, more, erudite, in, tone, his, literary, legacy, is, such, that, the, word, rabelaisian, designates, something, that, is, marked, by, gross, robust, humor, extravagance, of, caricature, or, bold, naturalism, according, to, a, tradition, dating, back, to, roger, de, gaigni, res, 1642, 1715, fran, ois, rabelais, was, the, son, of, seneschal, and, lawyer, antoine, rabelais, and, was, born, at, the, estate, of, la, devini, re, in, seuilly, near, chinon, touraine, in, modern, day, indre, et, loire, where, a, rabelais, museum, can, be, found, today, the, exact, dates, of, his, birth, c, 1483, 1494, and, death, 1553, are, unknown, but, most, scholars, accept, his, likely, birthdate, as, being, 1483, his, education, was, likely, typical, of, the, late, medieval, period, beginning, with, the, trivium, syllabus, that, included, the, study, of, grammar, rhetoric, and, dialectic, before, moving, on, to, the, quadrivium, which, dealt, with, arithmetic, geometry, music, and, astronomy, in, 1623, jacques, bruneau, de, tartifume, wrote, that, rabelais, began, his, life, as, a, novice, of, the, franciscan, order, of, cordeliers, at, the, convent, of, the, cordeliers, near, angers, however, there, is, no, direct, evidence, to, support, this, theory, by, 1520, he, was, at, fontenay, le, comte, in, poitou, where, he, became, friends, with, pierre, lamy, a, fellow, franciscan, and, corresponded, with, guillaume, bud, who, observed, that, he, was, already, competent, in, law, following, erasmus, commentary, on, the, original, greek, version, of, the, gospel, of, luke, the, sorbonne, banned, the, study, of, greek, in, 1523, believing, that, it, encouraged, personal, interpretation, of, the, new, testament, as, a, result, both, lamy, and, rabelais, had, their, greek, books, confiscated, frustrated, by, the, ban, rabelais, petitioned, pope, clement, vii, 1523, 1534, and, obtained, an, indult, with, the, help, of, bishop, geoffroy, d, estissac, and, was, able, to, leave, the, franciscans, for, the, benedictine, order, at, maillezais, at, the, saint, pierre, de, maillezais, abbey, he, worked, as, a, secretary, to, the, bishop, a, well, read, prelate, appointed, by, francis, i, and, enjoyed, his, protection, around, 1527, he, left, the, monastery, without, authorization, becoming, an, apostate, until, pope, paul, iii, absolved, him, of, this, crime, which, carried, with, it, the, risk, of, severe, sanctions, in, 1536, until, this, time, church, law, forbade, him, to, work, as, a, doctor, or, surgeon, j, lesellier, surmises, that, it, was, during, the, time, he, spent, in, paris, from, 1528, to, 1530, that, two, of, his, three, children, fran, ois, and, junie, were, born, after, paris, rabelais, went, to, the, university, of, poitiers, and, then, to, the, university, of, montpellier, to, study, medicine, in, 1532, he, moved, to, lyon, one, of, the, intellectual, centres, of, the, renaissance, and, began, working, as, a, doctor, at, the, hospital, h, tel, dieu, de, lyon, during, his, time, in, lyon, he, edited, latin, works, for, the, printer, sebastian, gryphius, and, wrote, a, famous, admiring, letter, to, erasmus, to, accompany, the, transmission, of, a, greek, manuscript, from, the, printer, gryphius, published, rabelais, translations, and, annotations, of, hippocrates, galen, and, giovanni, manardo, in, 1537, he, returned, to, montpellier, to, pay, the, fees, to, obtain, his, licence, to, practice, medicine, april, 3, and, obtained, his, doctorate, the, following, month, may, 22, upon, his, return, to, lyon, in, the, summer, he, gave, an, anatomy, lesson, at, lyon, s, h, tel, dieu, using, the, corpse, of, a, hanged, man, which, etienne, dolet, described, in, his, carmina, it, was, through, his, work, and, scholarship, in, the, field, of, medicine, that, rabelais, gained, european, fame, in, 1532, under, the, pseudonym, alcofribas, nasier, an, anagram, of, fran, ois, rabelais, he, published, his, first, book, pantagruel, king, of, the, dipsodes, the, first, of, his, gargantua, series, primarily, to, supplement, his, income, at, the, hospital, the, idea, of, basing, an, allegory, on, the, lives, of, giants, came, to, rabelais, from, the, folklore, legend, of, les, grandes, chroniques, du, grand, et, norme, g, ant, gargantua, which, were, sold, by, colporteurs, and, at, the, fairs, of, lyon, as, popular, literature, in, the, form, of, inexpensive, pamphlets, the, first, edition, of, an, almanac, parodying, the, astrological, predictions, of, the, time, called, pantagrueline, prognostications, appeared, for, the, year, 1533, from, the, press, of, rabelais, publisher, fran, ois, juste, it, contained, the, name, ma, tre, alcofribas, in, its, full, title, the, popular, almanacs, continued, irregularly, until, the, final, 1542, edition, which, was, prepared, for, the, perpetual, year, from, 1537, they, were, printed, at, the, end, of, juste, s, editions, of, pantagruel, pantagruelism, is, an, eat, drink, and, be, merry, philosophy, which, led, his, books, into, disfavor, with, the, theologians, but, brought, them, popular, success, and, the, admiration, of, later, critics, for, their, focus, on, the, body, this, first, book, critical, of, the, existing, monastic, and, educational, system, contains, the, first, known, occurrence, in, french, of, the, words, encyclop, die, caballe, progr, s, and, utopie, among, others, the, book, became, popular, along, with, its, 1534, prequel, which, dealt, with, the, life, and, exploits, of, pantagruel, s, father, gargantua, and, which, was, more, infused, with, the, politics, of, the, day, and, overtly, favorable, to, the, monarchy, than, the, preceding, volume, had, been, the, 1534, re, edition, of, pantagruel, contains, many, orthographic, grammatical, and, typographical, innovations, in, particular, the, use, of, diacritics, accents, apostrophes, and, diaereses, which, was, then, new, in, french, mireille, huchon, ascribes, this, innovation, in, part, to, the, influence, of, dante, s, de, vulgari, eloquentia, on, french, letters, no, clear, evidence, establishes, when, jean, du, bellay, and, rabelais, met, nevertheless, when, du, bellay, was, sent, to, rome, in, january, 1534, to, convince, pope, cl, ment, vii, not, to, excommunicate, henry, viii, he, was, accompanied, by, rabelais, who, worked, as, his, secretary, and, personal, physician, until, his, return, in, april, during, his, stay, rabelais, found, the, city, fascinating, and, decided, to, bring, out, a, new, edition, of, bartolomeo, marliani, s, topographia, antiqua, romae, with, sebastien, gryphe, in, lyon, rabelais, quietly, left, the, h, tel, dieu, de, lyon, on, 13, february, 1535, after, receiving, his, salary, disappearing, until, august, 1535, as, a, result, of, the, tumultuous, affair, of, the, placards, which, led, francis, i, to, issue, an, edict, forbidding, all, printing, in, france, only, the, influence, of, the, du, bellays, allowed, the, printing, presses, to, run, again, in, may, jean, du, bellay, was, named, cardinal, and, still, with, a, diplomatic, mission, for, francis, i, had, rabelais, join, him, in, rome, during, this, time, rabelais, was, also, working, for, geoffroy, d, estissac, s, interests, and, maintained, a, correspondence, with, him, through, diplomatic, channels, under, royal, seal, as, far, as, poitiers, three, letters, from, rabelais, have, survived, on, 17, january, 1536, paul, iii, issued, a, papal, brief, authorizing, rabelais, to, join, a, benedictine, monastery, and, practice, medicine, as, long, as, he, refrained, from, surgery, jean, du, bellay, having, been, named, the, abbot, in, commendam, of, the, saint, maur, abbey, rabelais, arranged, to, be, assigned, there, knowing, that, the, monks, were, to, become, secular, clergy, the, following, year, in, 1540, rabelais, lived, for, a, short, time, in, turin, as, part, of, the, household, of, du, bellay, s, brother, guillaume, it, was, at, this, time, that, his, two, children, were, legitimized, by, paul, iii, the, same, year, that, his, third, child, th, odule, died, in, lyon, at, the, age, of, two, rabelais, also, spent, some, time, lying, low, under, periodic, threat, of, being, condemned, of, heresy, depending, upon, the, health, of, his, various, protectors, in, 1543, both, gargantua, and, pantagruel, were, condemned, by, the, sorbonne, then, a, theological, college, only, the, protection, of, du, bellay, saved, rabelais, after, the, condemnation, of, his, novel, by, the, sorbonne, in, june, 1543, rabelais, became, a, master, of, requests, between, 1545, and, 1547, fran, ois, rabelais, lived, in, metz, then, a, free, imperial, city, and, a, republic, to, escape, the, condemnation, by, the, university, of, paris, in, 1547, he, became, curate, of, saint, christophe, du, jambet, in, maine, and, of, meudon, near, paris, with, support, from, members, of, the, prominent, du, bellay, family, rabelais, had, received, approval, from, king, francis, i, to, continue, to, publish, his, collection, on, 19, september, 1545, for, six, years, however, on, 31, december, 1546, the, tiers, livre, joined, the, sorbonne, s, list, of, banned, books, after, the, king, s, death, in, 1547, the, academic, lite, frowned, upon, rabelais, and, the, paris, parlement, suspended, the, sale, of, the, fourth, book, published, in, 1552, despite, henry, ii, having, accorded, him, the, royal, privilege, this, suspension, proved, ineffective, for, the, time, being, as, the, king, reiterated, his, support, for, the, book, rabelais, resigned, from, the, curacy, in, january, 1553, and, died, in, paris, later, that, year, gargantua, and, pantagruel, relates, the, adventures, of, gargantua, and, his, son, pantagruel, the, tales, are, adventurous, and, erudite, festive, and, gross, ecumenical, and, rarely, if, ever, solemn, for, long, the, first, book, chronologically, was, pantagruel, king, of, the, dipsodes, and, the, gargantua, mentioned, in, the, prologue, refers, not, to, rabelais, own, work, but, to, storybooks, that, were, being, sold, at, the, lyon, fairs, in, the, early, 1530s, in, the, first, chapter, of, the, earliest, book, pantagruel, s, lineage, is, listed, back, 60, generations, to, a, giant, named, chalbroth, the, narrator, dismisses, the, skeptics, of, the, time, who, would, have, thought, a, giant, far, too, large, for, noah, s, ark, stating, that, hurtaly, the, giant, reigning, during, the, flood, and, a, great, fan, of, soup, simply, rode, the, ark, like, a, kid, on, a, rocking, horse, or, like, a, fat, swiss, guy, on, a, cannon, in, the,

frequently, absurd, a, few, relatively, serious, passages, have, become, famous, for, expressing, humanistic, ideals, of, the, time, in, particular, the, chapters, on, gargantua, s, boyhood, and, gargantua, s, paternal, letter, to, pantagruel, 192, 96, present, a, quite, detailed, vision, of, education, in, the, second, novel, gargantua, m, alcofribas, narrates, the, abbey, of, th, l, me,

for, the, 1552, edition, the, third, book, was, condemned, by, the, sorbonne, like, the, previous, tomes, in, it, rabelais, revisited, discussions, he, had, had, while, working, as, a, secretary, to, geoffroy, d, estissac, earlier, in, fontenay, le, comte, where, la, querelle, des, femmes, had, been, a, lively, subject, of, debate, more, recent, exchanges, with, marguerite, de, navarre, possibly, about, the, question, of, clandestine, marriage, and, the, book, of, tobit, whose, canonical, status, was, being, debated, at, the, council, of, trent, led, rabelais, to, dedicate, the, book, to, her, before, she, wrote, the, heptameron, in, contrast, to, the, two, preceding, chronicles, the, dialogue, between, the, characters, is, much, more, developed, than, the, plot, elements, in, the, third, book, in, particular, the, central, question, of, the, book, which, panurge, and, pantagruel, consider, from, multiple, points, of, view, is, an, abstract, one, whether, panurge, should, marry, or, not, torn, between, the, desire, for, a, wife, and, the, fear, of, being, cuckolded, panurge, engages, in, divinatory, methods, like, dream, interpretation, and, bibliomancy, he, consults, authorities, vested, with, revealed, knowledge, like, the, sibyl, of, panzoust, or, the, mute, nazdecabre, profane, acquaintances, like, the, theologian, hippothad, e, or, the, philosopher, trouillogan, and, even, the, jester, triboulet, it, is, likely, that, several, of, the, characters, refer, to, real, people, abel, lefranc, argues, that, hippothad, e, was, jacques, lef, vre, d, taples, rondibilis, was, the, doctor, guillaume, rondelet, the, esoteric, her, trippa, corresponds, to, cornelius, agrippa, one, of, the, comic, features, of, the, story, is, the, contradictory, interpretations, pantagruel, and, panurge, get, embroiled, in, the, first, of, which, being, the, paradoxical, encomium, of, debts, in, chapter, iii, the, third, book, deeply, indebted, to, in, praise, of, folly, contains, the, first, known, attestation, of, the, word, paradoxe, in, french, the, more, reflective, tone, shows, the, characters, evolution, from, the, earlier, tomes, here, panurge, is, not, as, crafty, as, pantagruel, and, is, stubborn, in, his, will, to, turn, every, sign, to, his, advantage, refusing, to, listen, to, advice, he, had, himself, sought, out, for, example, when, her, trippa, reads, dark, omens, in, his, future, marriage, panurge, accuses, him, of, the, same, blind, self, love, philautie, from, which, he, seems, to, suffer, his, erudition, is, more, often, put, to, work, for, pedantry, than, let, to, settle, into, wisdom, by, contrast, pantagruel, s, speech, gains, in, weightiness, by, the, third, book, the, exuberance, of, the, young, giant, having, faded, at, the, end, of, the, third, book, the, protagonists, decide, to, set, sail, in, search, of, a, discussion, with, the, oracle, of, the, divine, bottle, the, last, chapters, are, focused, on, the, praise, of, pantagruelion, which, combines, properties, of, linen, and, hemp, a, plant, used, in, the, 16th, century, for, both, the, hangman, s, rope, and, medicinal, purposes, being, copiously, loaded, onto, the, ships, as, a, naturalist, inspired, by, pliny, the, elder, and, charles, estienne, the, narrator, intercedes, in, the, story, first, describing, the, plant, in, great, detail, then, waxing, lyrical, on, its, various, qualities, rabelais, began, work, on, the, fourth, book, while, still, in, metz, he, dropped, off, a, manuscript, containing, eleven, chapters, and, ending, mid, sentence, in, lyon, on, his, way, to, rome, to, work, as, cardinal, du, bellay, s, personal, physician, in, 1548, according, to, jean, plattard, this, publication, served, two, purposes, first, it, brought, rabelais, some, much, needed, money, and, second, it, allowed, him, to, respond, to, those, who, considered, his, work, blasphemous, while, the, prologue, denounced, slanderers, the, following, chapters, did, not, raise, any, polemical, issues, already, it, contained, some, of, the, best, known, episodes, including, the, storm, at, sea, and, panurge, s, sheep, it, was, framed, as, an, erratic, odyssey, inspired, both, by, the, argonauts, and, the, news, of, jacques, cartier, s, voyage, to, canada, the, full, version, appeared, in, 1552, after, rabelais, received, a, royal, privilege, on, 6, aug, 1550, for, the, exclusive, right, to, publish, his, work, in, french, tuscan, greek, and, latin, this, he, accomplished, with, the, help, of, the, young, cardinal, of, ch, tillon, odet, de, coligny, who, would, later, convert, to, protestantism, and, be, excommunicated, rabelais, thanks, the, cardinal, for, his, help, in, the, prefatory, letter, signed, 28, january, 1552, and, for, the, first, time, in, the, pantagruel, series, titled, the, prologue, in, his, own, name, rather, than, using, a, pseudonym, the, french, renaissance, was, a, time, of, linguistic, contact, and, debate, the, first, book, of, french, rather, than, latin, grammar, was, published, in, 1530, followed, nine, years, later, by, the, language, s, first, dictionary, spelling, was, far, less, codified, rabelais, as, an, educated, reader, of, the, day, preferred, etymological, spelling, preserving, clues, to, the, lineage, of, words, to, more, phonetic, spellings, which, wash, those, traces, away, rabelais, use, of, latin, greek, regional, and, dialectal, terms, creative, calquing, gloss, neologism, and, mis, translation, was, the, fruit, of, the, printing, press, having, been, invented, less, than, a, hundred, years, earlier, a, doctor, by, trade, rabelais, was, a, prolific, reader, who, wrote, a, great, deal, about, bodies, and, all, they, excrete, or, ingest, his, fictional, works, are, filled, with, multilingual, often, sexual, puns, absurd, creatures, bawdy, songs, and, lists, words, and, metaphors, from, rabelais, abound, in, modern, french, and, some, words, have, found, their, way, into, english, through, thomas, urquhart, s, unfinished, 1693, translation, completed, and, considerably, augmented, by, peter, anthony, motteux, by, 1708, according, to, radio, canada, the, novel, gargantua, permanently, added, more, than, 800, words, to, the, french, language, most, scholars, today, agree, that, rabelais, wrote, from, a, perspective, of, christian, humanism, this, has, not, always, been, the, case, abel, lefranc, in, his, 1922, introduction, to, pantagruel, depicted, rabelais, as, a, militant, anti, christian, atheist, on, the, contrary, m, a, screech, like, lucien, febvre, before, him, describes, rabelais, as, an, erasmian, while, formally, a, roman, catholic, rabelais, was, a, humanist, and, favoured, classical, antiquity, over, the, barbarous, middle, ages, believing, in, the, need, for, reform, to, return, science, and, arts, to, their, classical, blossoming, and, theology, and, the, church, to, their, original, evangelical, form, as, expressed, in, the, gospels, in, particular, he, was, critical, of, monasticism, rabelais, criticised, what, he, considered, to, be, inauthentic, christian, positions, by, both, catholics, and, protestants, and, was, attacked, and, portrayed, as, a, threat, to, religion, or, even, an, atheist, by, both, for, example, at, the, request, of, catholic, theologians, all, four, pantagrueline, chronicles, were, censured, by, either, the, sorbonne, parlement, or, both, on, the, opposite, end, of, the, spectrum, john, calvin, saw, rabelais, as, a, representative, of, the, numerous, moderate, evangelical, humanists, who, while, critical, of, contemporary, catholic, institutions, doctrines, and, conduct, did, not, go, far, enough, in, addition, calvin, considered, rabelais, apparent, mocking, tone, to, be, especially, dangerous, since, it, could, be, easily, misinterpreted, as, a, rejection, of, the, sacred, truths, themselves, timothy, hampton, writes, that, to, a, degree, unequaled, by, the, case, of, any, other, writer, from, the, european, renaissance, the, reception, of, rabelais, s, work, has, involved, dispute, critical, disagreement, and, scholarly, wrangling, in, particular, as, pointed, out, by, bruno, braunrot, the, traditional, view, of, rabelais, as, a, humanist, has, been, challenged, by, early, post, structuralist, analyses, denying, a, single, consistent, ideological, message, of, his, text, and, to, some, extent, earlier, by, marxist, critiques, such, as, mikhail, bakhtin, with, his, emphasis, on, the, subversive, folk, roots, of, rabelais, humour, in, medieval, carnival, culture, at, present, however, whatever, controversy, still, surrounds, rabelais, studies, can, be, found, above, all, in, the, application, of, feminist, theories, to, rabelais, criticism, as, he, is, alternately, considered, a, misogynist, or, a, feminist, based, on, different, episodes, in, his, works, an, article, by, edwin, m, duvall, in, tudes, rabelaisiennes, 18, 1985, sparked, a, debate, on, the, prologue, of, gargantua, in, the, pages, of, the, revue, d, histoire, litt, raire, de, la, france, as, to, whether, rabelais, intentionally, hid, higher, meanings, in, his, work, to, be, discovered, through, erudition, and, philology, or, if, instead, the, polyvalence, of, symbols, was, a, poetic, device, meant, to, resist, the, reductive, gloss, michel, jeanneret, suggests, that, panurge, s, description, in, the, papimane, island, episode, in, the, fourth, book, of, the, ill, effects, of, the, pages, of, decretals, being, used, as, toilet, paper, targets, cones, and, masks, on, whatever, they, touch, was, due, to, their, misuse, as, material, objects, as, the, merry, crew, sail, on, from, the, island, towards, the, divine, bottle, in, the, subsequent, episode, pantagruel, is, content, simply, listening, to, the, thawing, words, as, they, rain, down, on, the, boat, whereas, jeanneret, observes, that, his,
