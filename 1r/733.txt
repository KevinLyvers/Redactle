canonised, as, a, confucian, classic, one, primary, principle, of, his, work, is, that, human, nature, is, righteous, and, humane, the, responses, of, citizens, to, the, policies, of, rulers, embodies, this, principle, and, a, state, with, righteous, and, humane, policies, will, flourish, by, nature, the, citizens, with, freedom, from, good, rule, will, then, allocate, time, to, caring, for, their, wives, brothers, elders, and, children, and, be, educated, with, rites, and, naturally, become, better, citizens, this, placed, him, at, odds, with, his, near, contemporary, xunzi, who,

his, grave, mencius, s, mother, is, often, held, up, as, an, exemplary, female, figure, in, chinese, culture, one, of, the, most, famous, traditional, chengyu, is, m, ngm, s, nqi, n, mencius, s, mother, moves, three, times, this, saying, refers, to, the, legend, that, mencius, s, mother, moved, houses, three, times, before, finding, a, location, that, she, felt, was, suitable, for, the, child, s, upbringing, as, an, expression, the, idiom, refers, to, the, importance, of, finding, the, proper, environment, for, raising, children, mencius, s, father, meng, ji, died, when, mencius,

mencius, became, a, scholar, another, story, further, illustrates, the, emphasis, that, mencius, s, mother, placed, on, her, son, s, education, as, the, story, goes, once, when, mencius, was, young, he, was, a, truant, his, mother, responded, to, his, apparent, disregard, for, his, education, by, taking, up, a, pair, of, scissors, and, cutting, the, cloth, she, had, been, weaving, in, front, of, him, this, was, intended, to, illustrate, that, one, cannot, stop, a, task, midway, and, her, example, inspired, mencius, to, be, diligent, in, his, studies, there, is, another, legend, about, his, mother, and, his, wife, involving, a, time, when, his, wife, was, at, home, alone, and, was, discovered, by, mencius, not, to, be, sitting, properly, mencius, thought, his, wife, had, violated, a, rite, and, demanded, a, divorce, his, mother, claimed, that, it, was, written, in, the, book, of, rites, that, before, a, person, entered, a, room, he, should, announce, his, imminent, presence, loudly, to, let, others, prepare, for, his, arrival, as, he, had, not, done, that, in, this, case, the, person, who, had, violated, the, rite, was, mencius, himself, eventually, mencius, admitted, his, fault, she, is, one, of, 125, women, of, which, biographies, have, been, included, in, the, biographies, of, exemplary, women, written, by, liu, xiang, mencius, expounds, on, the, concept, that, the, human, is, naturally, righteous, and, humane, it, is, the, influence, of, society, that, causes, bad, moral, character, mencius, describes, this, in, the, context, of, educating, rulers, and, citizens, about, the, nature, of, man, he, who, exerts, his, mind, to, the, utmost, knows, his, nature, and, the, way, of, learning, is, none, other, than, finding, the, lost, mind, to, show, innate, goodness, mencius, used, the, example, of, a, child, falling, down, a, well, witnesses, of, this, event, immediately, feel, alarm, and, distress, not, to, gain, friendship, with, the, child, s, parents, nor, to, seek, the, praise, of, their, neighbors, and, friends, nor, because, they, dislike, the, reputation, the, feeling, of, commiseration, definitely, is, the, beginning, of, humanity, the, feeling, of, shame, and, dislike, is, the, beginning, of, righteousness, the, feeling, of, deference, and, compliance, is, the, beginning, of, propriety, and, the, feeling, of, right, or, wrong, is, the, beginning, of, wisdom, men, have, these, four, beginnings, just, as, they, have, their, four, limbs, having, these, four, beginnings, but, saying, that, they, cannot, develop, them, is, to, destroy, themselves, human, nature, has, an, innate, tendency, towards, goodness, but, moral, rightness, cannot, be, instructed, down, to, the, last, detail, this, is, why, merely, external, controls, always, fail, in, improving, society, true, improvement, results, from, educational, cultivation, in, favorable, environments, likewise, bad, environments, tend, to, corrupt, the, human, will, this, however, is, not, proof, of, innate, evil, because, a, clear, thinking, person, would, avoid, causing, harm, to, others, this, position, of, mencius, puts, him, between, confucians, such, as, xunzi, who, thought, people, were, innately, bad, and, taoists, who, believed, humans, did, not, need, cultivation, they, just, needed, to, accept, their, innate, natural, and, effortless, goodness, the, four, beginnings, sprouts, could, grow, and, develop, or, they, could, fail, in, this, way, mencius, synthesized, integral, parts, of, taoism, into, confucianism, individual, effort, was, needed, to, cultivate, oneself, but, one, s, natural, tendencies, were, good, to, begin, with, the, object, of, education, is, the, cultivation, of, benevolence, ren, according, to, mencius, education, must, awaken, the, innate, abilities, of, the, human, mind, he, denounced, memorization, and, advocated, active, interrogation, of, the, text, saying, one, who, believes, all, of, a, book, would, be, better, off, without, books, from, one, should, check, for, internal, consistency, by, comparing, sections, and, debate, the, probability, of, factual, accounts, by, comparing, them, with, experience, mencius, also, believed, in, the, power, of, destiny, in, shaping, the, roles, of, human, beings, in, society, what, is, destined, cannot, be, contrived, by, the, human, intellect, or, foreseen, destiny, is, shown, when, a, path, arises, that, is, both, unforeseen, and, constructive, destiny, should, not, be, confused, with, fate, mencius, denied, that, heaven, would, protect, a, person, regardless, of, his, actions, saying, one, who, understands, destiny, will, not, stand, beneath, a, tottering, wall, the, proper, path, is, one, which, is, natural, and, unforced, this, path, must, also, be, maintained, because, unused, pathways, are, covered, with, weeds, one, who, follows, destiny, will, live, a, long, and, successful, life, one, who, rebels, against, destiny, will, die, before, his, time, mencius, emphasized, the, significance, of, the, common, citizens, in, the, state, while, confucianism, generally, regards, rulers, highly, he, argued, that, it, is, acceptable, for, the, subjects, to, overthrow, or, even, kill, a, ruler, who, ignores, the, people, s, needs, and, rules, harshly, this, is, because, a, ruler, who, does, not, rule, justly, is, no, longer, a, true, ruler, speaking, of, the, overthrow, of, the, wicked, king, zhou, of, shang, mencius, said, i, have, merely, heard, of, killing, a, villain, zhou, but, i, have, not, heard, of, murdering, the, ruler, this, saying, should, not, be, taken, as, an, instigation, to, violence, against, authorities, but, as, an, application, of, confucian, philosophy, to, society, confucianism, requires, a, clarification, of, what, may, be, reasonably, expected, in, any, given, relationship, all, relationships, should, be, beneficial, but, each, has, its, own, principle, or, inner, logic, a, ruler, must, justify, his, position, by, acting, benevolently, before, he, can, expect, reciprocation, from, the, people, in, this, view, a, king, is, like, a, steward, although, confucius, admired, kings, of, great, accomplishment, mencius, is, clarifying, the, proper, hierarchy, of, human, society, although, a, king, has, presumably, higher, status, than, a, commoner, he, is, actually, subordinate, to, the, masses, of, people, and, the, resources, of, society, otherwise, there, would, be, an, implied, disregard, of, the, potential, of, human, society, heading, into, the, future, one, is, significant, only, for, what, one, gives, not, for, what, one, takes, mencius, distinguished, between, superior, men, who, recognize, and, follow, the, virtues, of, righteousness, and, benevolence, and, inferior, men, who, do, not, he, suggested, that, superior, men, considered, only, righteousness, not, benefits, that, assumes, permanent, property, to, uphold, common, morality, to, secure, benefits, for, the, disadvantaged, and, the, aged, he, advocated, free, trade, low, tax, rates, and, a, more, equal, sharing, of, the, tax, burden, in, regards, to, the, confucian, perspective, of, the, marketplace, more, about, confucius, thoughts, from, mencius, than, from, the, philosopher, himself, are, learned, the, government, should, have, a, mostly, hands, off, approach, regarding, the, marketplace, this, was, in, part, to, prevent, state, run, monopolies, however, it, was, also, the, state, s, responsibility, to, protect, against, future, monopolies, that, might, come, into, existence, mencius, also, advocated, for, no, taxes, on, imports, the, market, was, to, exchange, for, what, you, lacked, so, taxing, merchants, importing, goods, would, ultimately, hurt, the, villagers, the, thought, behind, this, is, that, people, are, inherently, good, and, rational, and, can, be, trusted, to, regulate, themselves, so, price, gouging, or, deception, would, not, be, an, issue, taxes, on, the, property, were, acceptable, and, to, be, the, only, means, by, which, the, dukes, and, states, would, collect, money, they, did, not, need, to, collect, much, because, taxes, were, only, for, supplemental, funds, these, taxes, were, also, progressive, meaning, the, families, that, owned, larger, more, fertile, pieces, of, land, would, pay, more, than, the, families, with, uniform, land, allotments, scarcity, is, an, issue, in, any, market, however, mencius, emphasizes, the, reframing, of, the, idea, of, a, scarce, resource, instead, of, scarce, resources, are, to, be, seen, as, abundant, resources, are, gained, through, work, ethic, not, by, any, other, means, so, there, are, no, unfair, competitions, or, gains, to, preserve, these, natural, resources, they, needed, to, be, used, or, harvested, according, to, their, cycles, of, growth, or, replenishing, in, many, cases, posterity, has, priority, over, profit, mencius, s, interpretation, of, confucianism, has, generally, been, considered, the, orthodox, version, by, subsequent, chinese, philosophers, especially, by, the, neo, confucians, of, the, song, dynasty, mencius, s, disciples, included, a, large, number, of, feudal, lords, and, he, is, said, to, have, been, more, influential, than, confucius, had, been, the, mencius, is, one, of, the, four, books, that, zhu, xi, 1130, 1200, grouped, as, the, core, of, orthodox, neo, confucian, thought, in, contrast, to, the, sayings, of, confucius, which, are, short, and, self, contained, the, mencius, consists, of, long, dialogues, including, arguments, with, extensive, prose, it, was, generally, neglected, by, the, jesuit, missionaries, who, first, translated, the, confucian, canon, into, latin, and, other, european, languages, as, they, felt, that, the, neo, confucian, school, largely, consisted, of, buddhist, and, taoist, contamination, of, confucianism, matteo, ricci, also, particularly, disliked, what, they, had, believed, to, be, condemnation, of, celibacy, as, unfilial, which, is, rather, a, mistranslation, of, a, similar, word, referring, more, to, aspects, of, personality, fran, ois, no, l, who, felt, that, zhu, s, ideas, represented, a, natural, and, native, development, of, confucius, s, thought, was, the, first, to, publish, a, full, edition, of, the, mencius, at, prague, in, 1711, as, the, chinese, rites, controversy, had, been, recently, decided, against, the, jesuits, however, his, edition, attained, little, influence, outside, central, and, eastern, europe, in, a, 1978, book, that, estimated, the, hundred, most, influential, persons, in, history, to, that, point, mencius, was, ranked, at, 92, the, first, mencius, institute, was, established, in, xuzhou, china, in, 2008, under, a, collaboration, between, jiangsu, normal, university, china, zoucheng, heritage, tourism, bureau, and, xuzhou, mengshi, clan, friendship, network, first, mencius, institute, outside, of, china, is, located, at, universiti, tunku, abdul, rahman, utar, kampar, campus, malaysia, in, 2016
