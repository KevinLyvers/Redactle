continued, in, his, later, albums, the, fuente, y, caudal, album, was, one, of, the, best, selling, spanish, records, for, several, months, and, de, luc, a, and, torregrosa, found, that, the, additional, instruments, and, approach, away, from, traditional, flamenco, proved, more, popular, with, the, general, public, the, early, influences, of, the, traditional, players, became,

that, did, not, betray, what, paco, had, in, store, for, the, flamenco, guitar, in, the, future, the, recording, was, released, as, en, vivo, desde, el, teatro, real, his, 1976, album, almoraima, was, a, wider, success, and, featured, almoraima, and, r, o, ancho, the, album, was, named, after, a, former, convent, of, the, same, name, located, about, 21, kilometres, 13, mi, from, algeciras, on, the,

composition, of, the, same, name, the, name, almoraima, is, of, arabic, origin, from, the, moorish, period, de, luc, a, performed, on, an, episode, of, parkinson, on, bbc, in, the, uk, in, which, michael, parkinson, said, a, marvelous, young, musician, who, is, making, his, very, first, appearance, on, british, television, his, unconventional, and, modern, approach, to, playing, flamenco, has, already, made, him, a, big, star, in, europe, particularly, in, his, native, spain, in, 1977, de, luc, a, married, casilda, varela, the, daughter, of, general, varela, and, descendant, to, a,

antonio, s, nchez, with, the, exception, of, the, buler, as, samara, which, s, nchez, and, de, la, isla, wrote, together, this, would, be, his, last, lp, with, a, singer, for, at, least, 15, years, he, reportedly, said, that, the, human, voice, is, naturally, too, limited, and, that, he, prefers, the, exploration, of, different, instrumentalists, he, also, said, a, busy, schedule, was, the, reason, for, lack, of, recordings, with, singers, he, performed, extensively, across, the, us, and, europe, during, this, period, increasing, his, popularity, outside, spain, and, the, flamenco, community, in, europe, and, met, many, jazz, latin, and, other, musicians, who, continued, to, influence, de, luc, a, s, evolution, as, a, nuevo, flamenco, player, he, began, to, show, a, very, keen, interest, in, jazz, fusion, and, rock, and, in, 1977, performed, with, carlos, santana, in, the, plaza, de, toros, de, las, arenas, bullring, in, barcelona, he, was, invited, by, al, di, meola, to,

traditionalist, flamenco, critics, did, not, approve, of, the, piece, and, hated, that, many, people, considered, mediterranean, sundance, flamenco, music, and, frowned, upon, de, luc, a, di, meola, informed, the, critics, not, to, worry, and, that, paco, is, not, leaving, flamenco, but, expanding, it, in, 1978, paco, and, his, brothers, recorded, interpreta, a, manuel, de, falla, a, classical,

video, recorded, at, london, s, royal, albert, hall, entitled, meeting, of, the, spirits, pohren, said, that, de, luc, a, s, decision, to, work, with, musicians, like, mclaughlin, di, meola, coryell, and, chick, corea, must, have, been, an, exciting, and, stimulating, experience, for, him, given, their, technical, musical, knowledge, and, ability, to, improvise, and, said, that, they, carried, him, so, far, afield, that, at, times, he, must, have, been, profoundly, confused, a, man, running, the, risk, of, losing, his, musical, identity, this, concerned, de, luc, a, who, said, in, a, late, 1990s, interview, i, have, never, lost, the, roots, in, my, music, because, i, would, lose, myself, what, i, have, tried, to, do, is, have, a, hand, holding, onto, tradition, and, the, other, scratching, digging, in, other, places, trying, to, find, new, things, i, can, bring, into, flamenco, the, guitar, trio, continued, touring, in, 1980, with, larry, coryell, being, replaced, by, al, di, meola, in, 1981, de, luc, a, reportedly, suffered, from, headaches, and, backaches, while, performing, because, he, found, it, difficult, to, improvise, and, follow, mclaughlin, and, coryell, s, advanced, knowledge, of, jazz, improvisation, paco, professed, some, people, assume, that, they, were, learning, from, me, but, i, can, tell, you, it, was, me, learning, from, them, i, have, never, studied, music, i, am, incapable, of, studying, harmony, i, don, t, have, the, discipline, playing, with, mclaughlin, and, di, meola, was, about, learning, these, things, also, in, 1981, the, guitar, trio, released, one, of, their, most, successful, records, friday, night, in, san, francisco, which, sold, over, 1, million, copies, and, generated, a, significant, interest, in, flamenco, music, in, america, and, europe, it, featured, an, extended, combination, of, mediterranean, sundance, and, r, o, ancho, this, became, arguably, the, piece, most, associated, with, the, musicians, de, luc, a,

downbeat, magazine, di, meola, said, that, the, reason, for, the, breakdown, was, that, their, performances, were, designed, to, drive, the, audience, berserk, with, a, display, of, astonishing, virtuosity, and, that, they, had, run, out, of, new, spectacular, fast, runs, to, impress, the, audiences, di, meola, remarked, that, the, music, had, become, too, wild, and, crazy, and, that, he,
