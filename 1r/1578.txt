this, to, happen, he, believed, there, needed, to, be, a, comprehensive, justification, for, anti, british, pro, hindu, activism, for, this, end, he, sought, justification, in, the, supposed, original, principles, of, the, ramayana, and, the, bhagavad, gita, he, named, this, call, to, activism, karma, yoga, or, the, yoga, of, action, in, his, interpretation, the, bhagavad, gita, reveals, this, principle, in, the, conversation, between, krishna, and, arjuna, when, krishna, exhorts, arjuna, to, fight, his, enemies, which, in, this, case, included, many, members, of, his, family, because, it, is, his, duty, in, tilak, s, opinion, the, bhagavad, gita, provided, a, strong, justification, of, activism, however, this, conflicted, with, the, mainstream, exegesis, of, the, text, at, the, time, which, was, dominated, by, renunciate, views, and, the, idea, of, acts, purely, for, god, this, was, represented, by, the, two, mainstream, views, at, the, time, by, ramanuja, and, adi, shankara, to, find, support, for, this, philosophy, tilak, wrote, his, own, interpretations, of, the, relevant, passages, of, the, gita, and, backed, his, views, using, jnanadeva, s, commentary, on,

reformer, behramji, malabari, supported, the, age, of, consent, act, 1891, to, raise, the, age, of, a, girl, s, eligibility, for, marriage, tilak, opposed, the, bill, and, said, that, the, parsis, as, well, as, the, english, had, no, jurisdiction, over, the, hindu, religious, matters, he, blamed, the, girl, for, having, defective, female, organs, and, questioned, how, the, husband, could, be, persecuted, diabolically, for, doing, a, harmless, act, he, called, the, girl, one, of, those, dangerous, freaks, of, nature, tilak, did, not, have, a, progressive, view, when, it, came, to, gender, relations, he, did, not, believe, that, hindu, women, should, get, a, modern, education, rather, he, had, a, more, conservative, view, believing, that, women, were, meant, to, be, homemakers, who, had, to, subordinate, themselves, to, the, needs, of, their, husbands, and, children, tilak, refused, to, sign, a, petition, for, the, abolition, of, untouchability, in, 1918, two, years, before, his,

tilak, that, tilak, would, work, towards, nationalism, in, the, political, arena, while, vivekananda, would, work, for, nationalism, in, the, religious, arena, when, vivekananda, died, at, a, young, age, tilak, expressed, great, sorrow, and, paid, tributes, to, him, in, the, kesari, tilak, said, about, vivekananda, no, hindu, who, has, the, interests, of, hinduism, at, his, heart, could, help, feeling, grieved, over, vivekananda, s, samadhi, vivekananda, in, short, had, taken, the, work, of, keeping, the, banner, of, advaita, philosophy, forever, flying, among, all, the, nations, of, the, world, and, made, them, realize, the, true, greatness, of, hindu, religion, and, of, the, hindu, people, he, had, hoped, that, he, would, crown, his, achievement, with, the, fulfillment, of, this, task, by, virtue, of, his, learning, eloquence, enthusiasm, and, sincerity, just, as, he, had, laid, a, secure, foundation, for, it, but, with, swami, s, samadhi, these, hopes, have, gone, thousands, of, years, ago, another, saint, shankaracharya, who, showed, to, the, world, the, glory, and, greatness, of, hinduism, at, the, fag, of, the, 19th, century, the, second, shankaracharya, is, vivekananda, who, showed, to, the, world, the, glory, of, hinduism, his, work, has, yet, to, be, completed, we, have, lost, our, glory, our, independence, everything, shahu, the, ruler, of, the, princely, state, of, kolhapur, had, several, conflicts, with, tilak, as, the, latter, agreed, with, the, brahmins, decision, of, puranic, rituals, for, the, marathas, that, were, intended, for, shudras, tilak, even, suggested, that, the, marathas, should, be, content, with, the, shudra, status, assigned, to, them, by, the, brahmins, tilak, s, newspapers, as, well, as, the, press, in, kolhapur, criticized, shahu, for, his, caste, prejudice, and, his, unreasoned, hostility, towards, brahmins, these, included, serious, allegations, such, as, sexual, assaults, by, shahu, against, four, brahmin, women, an, english, woman, named, lady, minto, was, petitioned, to, help, them, the, agent, of, shahu, had, blamed, these, allegations, on, the, troublesome, brahmins, tilak, and, another, brahmin, suffered, from, the, confiscation, of, estates, by, shahu, the, first, during, a, quarrel, between, shahu, and, the, shankaracharya, of, sankareshwar, and, later, in, another, issue, bal, gangadhar, tilak, was, released, from, prison, on, 16, june, 1914, he, commented, if, we, can, prove, to, the, non, brahmins, by, example, that, we, are, wholly, on, their, side, in, their, demands, from, the, government, i, am, sure, that, in, times, to, come, their, agitation, now, based, on, social, inequality, will, merge, into, our, struggle, if, a, god, were, to, tolerate, untouchability, i, would, not, recognize, him, as, god, at, all, tilak, started, two, weeklies, kesari, the, lion, in, marathi, and, mahratta, in, english, sometimes, referred, as, maratha, in, academic, study, books, in, 1880, 1881, with, gopal, ganesh, agarkar, as, the, first, editor, by, this, he, was, recognized, as, awakener, of, india, as, kesari, later, became, a, daily, and, continues, publication, to, this, day, in, 1894, tilak, transformed, the, household, worshipping, of, ganesha, into, a, grand, public, event, sarvajanik, ganeshotsav, the, celebrations, consisted, of, several, days, of, processions, music, and, food, they, were, organized, by, the, means, of, subscriptions, by, neighbourhood, caste, or, occupation, students, often, would, celebrate, hindu, and, national, glory, and, address, political, issues, including, patronage, of, swadeshi, goods, in, 1895, tilak, founded, the, shri, shivaji, fund, committee, for, the, celebration, of, shiv, jayanti, the, birth, anniversary, of, shivaji, the, founder, of, the, maratha, empire, the, project, also, had, the, objective, of, funding, the, reconstruction, of, the, tomb, samadhi, of, shivaji, at, raigad, fort, for, this, second, objective, tilak, established, the, shri, shivaji, raigad, smarak, mandal, along, with, senapati, khanderao, dabhade, ii, of, talegaon, dabhade, who, became, the, founder, president, of, the, mandal, the, events, like, the, ganapati, festival, and, shiv, jayanti, were, used, by, tilak, to, build, a, national, spirit, beyond, the, circle, of, the, educated, elite, in, opposition, to, colonial, rule, but, it, also, exacerbated, hindu, muslim, differences, the, festival, organizers, would, urge, hindus, to, protect, cows, and, boycott, the, muharram, celebrations, organized, by, shi, a, muslims, in, which, hindus, had, formerly, often, participated, thus, although, the, celebrations, were, meant, to, be, a, way, to, oppose, colonial, rule, they, also, contributed, to, religious, tensions, contemporary, marathi, hindu, nationalist, parties, like, the, shiv, sena, took, up, his, reverence, for, shivaji, however, indian, historian, uma, chakravarti, cites, professor, gordon, johnson, and, states, it, is, significant, that, even, at, the, time, when, tilak, was, making, political, use, of, shivaji, the, question, of, conceding, kshatriya, status, to, him, as, maratha, was, resisted, by, the, conservative, brahmins, including, tilak, while, shivaji, was, a, brave, man, all, his, bravery, it, was, argued, did, not, give, him, the, right, to, a, status, that, very, nearly, approached, that, of, a, brahmin, further, the, fact, that, shivaji, worshiped, the, brahmanas, in, no, way, altered, social, relations, since, it, was, as, a, shudra, he, did, it, as, a, shudra, the, servant, if, not, the, slave, of, the, brahmin, the, deccan, education, society, that, tilak, founded, with, others, in, the, 1880s, still, runs, institutions, in, pune, like, the, fergusson, college, the, swadeshi, movement, started, by, tilak, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, became, part, of, the, independence, movement, until, that, goal, was, achieved, in, 1947, one, can, even, say, swadeshi, remained, part, of, indian, government, policy, until, the, 1990s, when, the, congress, government, liberalised, the, economy,
