faith, in, his, nephew, he, returned, to, delhi, believing, that, alauddin, would, carry, the, wealth, from, kara, to, delhi, after, reaching, kara, alauddin, sent, a, letter, of, apology, to, the, sultan, and, expressed, concern, that, his, enemies, may, have, poisoned, sultan, s, mind, against, him, during, his, absence, he, requested, a, letter, of, pardon, signed, by, the, sultan, which,

loyal, to, alauddin, meanwhile, ala, ul, mulk, who, was, alauddin, s, governor, at, kara, came, to, delhi, with, all, the, officers, elephants, and, wealth, that, alauddin, had, left, at, kara, alauddin, appointed, ala, ul, mulk, as, the, kotwal, of, delhi, and, placed, all, the, non, turkic, municipal, employees, under, his, charge, since, ala, ul, mulk, had, become, very, obese, the, governorship, of, kara, was, entrusted, to, nusrat, khan, who, had, become, unpopular, in, delhi, because, of, the, confiscations, in, the, winter, of, 1297, the, mongols, led, by, a, noyan, of, the,

mothers, according, to, ziauddin, barani, the, practice, of, punishing, wives, and, children, for, the, crimes, of, men, started, with, this, incident, in, delhi, in, 1299, the, chagatai, ruler, duwa, sent, a, mongol, force, led, by, qutlugh, khwaja, to, conquer, delhi, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, kili, alauddin, personally, led, the, delhi, forces, but, his, general, zafar, khan, attacked, the, mongols, without, waiting, for, his, orders, although, zafar, khan, managed, to, inflict, heavy, casualties, on, the, invaders, he, and, other, soldiers, in, his, unit, were, killed, in, the, battle, qutlugh, khwaja, was, also, seriously, wounded, forcing, the, mongols, to, retreat, around, the, same, time, alauddin, turned, his, attention, towards, the, present, day, state, of, rajasthan, to, subdue, the, rajput, kingdoms, for, a, secure, base, to, gujarat, and, malwa, and, for, further, expeditions, in, the, south, in, 1299, ce, alauddin, besieged, the, fortress, of, jaisalmer, ruled, by, bhatis, at, the, time, under, jait, singh, i, following, a, long, siege, and, due, to, the, dearth, of, food, and, resources, eventually, the, besieged, rajputs, under, the, command, of, mularaja, performed, saka, where, the, women, committed, jauhar, and, the, men, fought, until, death, thus, alauddin, successfully, penetrated, into, territories, of, the, bhattis, after, the, conquest, of, jaisalmer, it, remained, under, the, khalji, s, for, few, more, years, in, 1301, alauddin, ordered, ulugh, khan, and, nusrat, khan, to, invade, ranthambore, whose, king, hammiradeva, had, granted, asylum, to, the, leaders, of, the, mutiny, near, jalore, after, nusrat, khan, was, killed, during, the, siege, alauddin, personally, took, charge, of, the, siege, operations, and, conquered, the, fort, in, july, 1301, during, the, ranthambore, campaign, alauddin, faced, three, unsuccessful, rebellions, to, suppress, any, future, rebellions, he, set, up, an, intelligence, and, surveillance, system, instituted, a, total, prohibition, in, delhi, established, laws, to, prevent, his, nobles, from, networking, with, each, other, and, confiscated, wealth, from, the, general, public, in, the, winter, of, 1302, 1303, alauddin, dispatched, an, army, to, ransack, the, kakatiya, capital, warangal, meanwhile, he, himself, led, another, army, to, conquer, chittor, the, capital, of, the, guhila, kingdom, ruled, by, ratnasimha, alauddin, captured, chittor, after, an, eight, month, long, siege, according, to, his, courtier, amir, khusrau, he, ordered, a, massacre, of, 30, 000, local, hindus, after, this, conquest, some, later, legends, state, that, alauddin, invaded, chittor, to, capture, ratnasimha, s, beautiful, queen, padmini, but, most, modern, historians, have, rejected, the, authenticity, of, these, legends, while, the, imperial, armies, were, busy, in, chittor, and, warangal, campaigns, the, mongols, launched, another, invasion, of, delhi, around, august, 1303, alauddin, managed, to, reach, delhi, before, the, invaders, but, did, not, have, enough, time, to, prepare, for, a, strong, defence, meanwhile, the, warangal, campaign, was, unsuccessful, because, of, heavy, rains, according, to, ziauddin, barani, and, the, army, had, lost, several, men, and, its, baggage, neither, this, army, nor, the, reinforcements, sent, by, alauddin, s, provincial, governors, could, enter, the, city, because, of, the, blockades, set, up, by, the, mongols, under, these, difficult, circumstances, alauddin, took, shelter, in, a, heavily, guarded, camp, at, the, under, construction, siri, fort, the, mongols, engaged, his, forces, in, some, minor, conflicts, but, neither, army, achieved, a, decisive, victory, the, invaders, ransacked, delhi, and, its, neighbourhoods, but, ultimately, decided, to, retreat, after, being, unable, to, breach, siri, the, mongol, invasion, of, 1303, was, one, of, the, most, serious, invasions, of, india, and, prompted, alauddin, to, take, several, steps, to, prevent, its, repeat, he, strengthened, the, forts, and, the, military, presence, along, the, mongol, routes, to, india, he, also, implemented, a, series, of, economic, reforms, to, ensure, sufficient, revenue, inflows, for, maintaining, a, strong, army, in, 1304, alauddin, appears, to, have, ordered, a, second, invasion, of, gujarat, which, resulted, in, the, annexation, of, the, vaghela, kingdom, to, the, delhi, sultanate, in, 1305, he, launched, an, invasion, of, malwa, in, central, india, which, resulted, in, the, defeat, and, death, of, the, paramara, king, mahalakadeva, the, yajvapala, dynasty, which, ruled, the, region, to, the, north, east, of, malwa, also, appears, to, have, fallen, to, alauddin, s, invasion, in, december, 1305, the, mongols, invaded, india, again, instead, of, attacking, the, heavily, guarded, city, of, delhi, the, invaders, proceeded, south, east, to, the, gangetic, plains, along, the, himalayan, foothills, alauddin, s, 30, 000, strong, cavalry, led, by, malik, nayak, defeated, the, mongols, at, the, battle, of, amroha, many, mongols, were, taken, captive, and, killed, the, 16th, century, historian, firishta, claims, that, the, heads, sir, of, 8, 000, mongols, were, used, to, build, the, siri, fort, commissioned, by, alauddin, in, 1306, another, mongol, army, sent, by, duwa, advanced, up, to, the, ravi, river, ransacking, the, territories, along, the, way, alauddin, s, forces, led, by, malik, kafur, decisively, defeated, the, mongols, duwa, died, next, year, and, after, that, the, mongols, did, not, launch, any, further, expeditions, to, india, during, alauddin, s, reign, on, the, contrary, alauddin, s, dipalpur, governor, malik, tughluq, regularly, raided, the, mongol, territories, located, in, present, day, afghanistan, around, 1308, alauddin, sent, malik, kafur, to, invade, devagiri, whose, king, ramachandra, had, discontinued, the, tribute, payments, promised, in, 1296, and, had, granted, asylum, to, the, vaghela, king, karna, at, baglana, kafur, was, supported, by, alauddin, s, gujarat, governor, alp, khan, whose, forces, invaded, baglana, and, captured, karna, s, daughter, devaladevi, later, married, to, alauddin, s, son, khizr, khan, at, devagiri, kafur, achieved, an, easy, victory, and, ramachandra, agreed, to, become, a, lifelong, vassal, of, alauddin, meanwhile, a, section, of, alauddin, s, army, had, been, besieging, the, fort, of, siwana, in, marwar, region, unsuccessfully, for, several, years, in, august, september, 1308, alauddin, personally, took, charge, of, the, siege, operations, in, siwana, the, delhi, army, conquered, the, fort, in, the, siege, of, siwana, and, the, defending, ruler, sitaladeva, was, killed, in, november, 1308, the, plunder, obtained, from, devagiri, prompted, alauddin, to, plan, an, invasion, of, the, other, southern, kingdoms, which, had, accumulated, a, huge, amount, of, wealth, having, been, shielded, from, the, foreign, armies, that, had, ransacked, northern, india, in, late, 1309, he, sent, malik, kafur, to, ransack, the, kakatiya, capital, warangal, helped, by, ramachandra, of, devagiri, kafur, entered, the, kakatiya, territory, in, january, 1310, ransacking, towns, and, villages, on, his, way, to, warangal, after, a, month, long, siege, of, warangal, the, kakatiya, king, prataparudra, agreed, to, become, a, tributary, of, alauddin, and, surrendered, a, large, amount, of, wealth, possibly, including, the, koh, i, noor, diamond, to, the, invaders, meanwhile, after, conquering, siwana, alauddin, had, ordered, his, generals, to, subjugate, other, parts, of, marwar, before, returning, to, delhi, the, raids, of, his, generals, in, marwar, led, to, their, confrontations, with, kanhadadeva, the, chahamana, ruler, of, jalore, in, 1311, alauddin, s, general, malik, kamaluddin, gurg, captured, the, jalore, fort, after, defeating, and, killing, kanhadadeva, during, the, siege, of, warangal, malik, kafur, had, learned, about, the, wealth, of, the, hoysala, and, pandya, kingdoms, located, further, south, after, returning, to, delhi, he, took, alauddin, s, permission, to, lead, an, expedition, there, kafur, started, his, march, from, delhi, in, november, 1310, and, crossed, deccan, in, early, 1311, supported, by, alauddin, s, tributaries, ramachandra, and, prataparudra, at, this, time, the, pandya, kingdom, was, reeling, under, a, war, of, succession, between, the, two, brothers, vira, and, sundara, and, taking, advantage, of, this, the, hoysala, king, ballala, had, invaded, the, pandyan, territory, when, ballala, learned, about, kafur, s, march, he, hurried, back, to, his, capital, dwarasamudra, however, he, could, not, put, up, a, strong, resistance, and, negotiated, a, truce, after, a, short, siege, agreeing, to, surrender, his, wealth, and, become, a, tributary, of, alauddin, from, dwarasamudra, malik, kafur, marched, to, the, pandya, kingdom, where, he, raided, several, towns, reaching, as, far, as, madurai, both, vira, and, sundara, fled, their, headquarters, and, thus, kafur, was, unable, to, make, them, alauddin, s, tributaries, nevertheless, the, delhi, army, looted, many, treasures, elephants, and, horses, the, delhi, chronicler, ziauddin, barani, described, this, seizure, of, wealth, from, dwarasamudra, and, the, pandya, kingdom, as, the, greatest, one, since, the, muslim, capture, of, delhi, during, this, campaign, the, mongol, general, abachi, had, conspired, to, ally, with, the, pandyas, and, as, a, result, alauddin, ordered, him, to, be, executed, in, delhi, this, combined, with, their, general, grievances, against, alauddin, led, to, resentment, among, mongols, who, had, settled, in, india, after, converting, to, islam, a, section, of, mongol, leaders, plotted, to, kill, alauddin, but, the, conspiracy, was, discovered, by, alauddin, s, agents, alauddin, then, ordered, a, mass, massacre, of, mongols, in, his, empire, which, according, to, barani, resulted, in, the, death, of, 20, 000, or, 30, 000, mongols, meanwhile, in, devagiri, after, ramachandra, s, death, his, son, tried, to, overthrow, alauddin, s, suzerainty, malik, kafur, invaded, devagiri, again, in, 1313, defeated, him, and, became, the, governor, of, devagiri, alauddin, was, the, most, powerful, ruler, of, his, dynasty, unlike, the, previous, rulers, of, the, delhi, sultanate, who, had, largely, relied, on, the, pre, existing, administrative, set, up, alauddin, undertook, large, scale, reforms, after, facing, the, mongol, invasions, and, several, rebellions, he, implemented, several, reforms, to, be, able, to, maintain, a, large, army, and, to, weaken, those, capable, of, organizing, a, revolt, against, him, barani, also, attributes, alauddin, s, revenue, reforms, to, the, sultan, s, desire, to, subjugate, the, hindus, by, depriving, them, of, that, wealth, and, property, which, fosters, rebellion, according, to, historian, satish, chandra, alauddin, s, reforms, were, based, on, his, conception, of, fear, and, control, as, the, basis, of, good, government, as, well, as, his, military, ambitions, the, bulk, of, the, measures, were, designed, to, centralise, power, in, his, hands, and, to, support, a, large, military, some, of, alauddin, s, land, reforms, were, continued, by, his, successors, and, formed, a, basis, of, the, agrarian, reforms, introduced, by, the, later, rulers, such, as, sher, shah, suri, and, akbar, however, his, other, regulations, including, price, control, were, revoked, by, his, son, qutbuddin, mubarak, shah, a, few, months, after, his, death, the, countryside, and, agricultural, production, during, alauddin, s, time, was, controlled, by, the, village, headmen, the, traditional, hindu, authorities, he, viewed, their, haughtiness, and, their, direct, and, indirect, resistance, as, the, main, difficulty, affecting, his, reign, he, also, had, to, face, talk, of, conspiracies, at, his, court, after, some, initial, conspiracies, and, hindu, revolts, in, rural, areas, during, the, early, period, of, his, reign, he, struck, the, root, of, the, problem, by, introducing, reforms, that, also, aimed, at, ensuring, support, of, his, army, and, food, supply, to, his, capital, he, took, away, all, landed, properties, of, his, courtiers, and, nobles, and, cancelled, revenue, assignments, which, were, henceforth, controlled, by, the, central, authorities, henceforth, everybody, was, busy, with, earning, a, living, so, that, nobody, could, even, think, of, rebellion, he, also, ordered, to, supply, some, rules, and, regulations, for, grinding, down, the, hindus, and, for, depriving, them, of, that, wealth, and, property, which, fosters, rebellion, the, hindu, was, to, be, so, reduced, as, to, be, unable, to, keep, a, horse, to, ride, on, wear, fine, clothes, or, to, enjoy, any, luxuries, of, life, alauddin, brought, a, large, tract, of, fertile, land, under, the, directly, governed, crown, territory, by, eliminating, iqta, s, land, grants, and, vassals, in, the, ganga, yamuna, doab, region, he, imposed, a, 50, kharaj, tax, on, the, agricultural, produce, in, a, substantial, part, of, northern, india, this, was, the, maximum, amount, allowed, by, the, hanafi, school, of, islam, which, was, dominant, in, delhi, at, that, time, alauddin, khalji, s, taxation, system, was, probably, the, one, institution, from, his, reign, that, lasted, the, longest, surviving, indeed, into, the, nineteenth, or, even, the, twentieth, century, from, now, on, the, land, tax, kharaj, or, mal, became, the, principal, form, in, which, the, peasant, s, surplus, was, expropriated, by, the, ruling, class, alauddin, also, eliminated, the, intermediary, hindu, rural, chiefs, and, started, collecting, the, kharaj, directly, from, the, cultivators, he, did, not, levy, any, additional, taxes, on, agriculture, and, abolished, the, cut, that, the, intermediaries, received, for, collecting, revenue, alauddin, s, demand, for, tax, proportional, to, land, area, meant, that, the, rich, and, powerful, villages, with, more, land, had, to, pay, more, taxes, he, forced, the, rural, chiefs, to, pay, same, taxes, as, the, others, and, banned, them, from, imposing, illegal, taxes, on, the, peasants, to, prevent, any, rebellions, his, administration, deprived, the, rural, chiefs, of, their, wealth, horses, and, arms, by, suppressing, these, chiefs, alauddin, projected, himself, as, the, protector, of, the, weaker, section, of, the, rural, society, however, while, the, cultivators, were, free, from, the, demands, of, the, landowners, the, high, taxes, imposed, by, the, state, meant, a, cultivator, had, barely, enough, for, carrying, on, his, cultivation, and, his, food, requirements, to, enforce, these, land, and, agrarian, reforms, alauddin, set, up, a, strong, and, efficient, revenue, administration, system, his, government, recruited, many, accountants, collectors, and, agents, these, officials, were, well, paid, but, were, subject, to, severe, punishment, if, found, to, be, taking, bribes, account, books, were, audited, and, even, small, discrepancies, were, punished, the, effect, was, both, large, landowners, and, small, scale, cultivators, were, fearful, of, missing, out, on, paying, their, assessed, taxes, alauddin, s, government, imposed, the, jizya, tax, on, its, non, muslim, subjects, and, his, muslim, subjects, were, obligated, to, contribute, zakat, he, also, levied, taxes, on, residences, ghari, and, grazing, chara, i, which, were, not, sanctioned, by, the, islamic, law, in, addition, alauddin, demanded, four, fifths, share, of, the, spoils, of, war, from, his, soldiers, instead, of, the, traditional, one, fifth, share, khums, alauddin, implemented, price, control, measures, for, a, wide, variety, of, market, goods, alauddin, s, courtier, amir, khusrau, and, the, 14th, century, writer, hamid, qalandar, suggest, that, alauddin, introduced, these, changes, for, public, welfare, however, barani, states, that, alauddin, wanted, to, reduce, the, prices, so, that, low, salaries, were, acceptable, to, his, soldiers, and, thus, to, maintain, a, large, army, in, addition, barani, suggests, that, the, hindu, traders, indulged, in, profiteering, and, alauddin, s, market, reforms, resulted, from, the, sultan, s, desire, to, punish, the, hindus, to, ensure, that, the, goods, were, sold, at, regulated, prices, alauddin, appointed, market, supervisors, and, spies, and, received, independent, reports, from, them, to, prevent, a, black, market, his, administration, prohibited, peasants, and, traders, from, storing, the, grains, and, established, government, run, granaries, where, government, s, share, of, the, grain, was, stored, the, government, also, forced, the, transport, workers, to, re, settle, in, villages, at, specific, distances, along, the, yamuna, river, to, enable, rapid, transport, of, grain, to, delhi, chroniclers, such, as, khusrau, and, barani, state, that, the, prices, were, not, allowed, to, increase, during, alauddin, s, lifetime, even, when, the, rainfall, was, scarce, the, shopkeepers, who, violated, the, price, control, regulations, or, tried, to, circumvent, them, such, as, by, using, false, weights, were, given, severe, punishments, alauddin, maintained, a, large, standing, army, which, included, 475, 000, horsemen, according, to, the, 16th, century, chronicler, firishta, he, managed, to, raise, such, a, large, army, by, paying, relatively, low, salaries, to, his, soldiers, and, introduced, market, price, controls, to, ensure, that, the, low, salaries, were, acceptable, to, his, soldiers, although, he, was, opposed, to, granting, lands, to, his, generals, and, soldiers, he, generously, rewarded, them, after, successful, campaigns, especially, those, in, deccan, alauddin, s, government, maintained, a, descriptive, roll, of, every, soldier, and, occasionally, conducted, strict, reviews, of, the, army, to, examine, the, horses, and, arms, of, the, soldiers, to, ensure, that, no, horse, could, be, presented, twice, or, replaced, by, a, poor, quality, horse, during, the, review, alauddin, established, a, system, of, branding, the, horses, although, islam, bans, alcoholic, drinks, drinking, was, common, among, the, muslim, royals, and, nobles, of, the, delhi, sultanate, in, the, 13th, century, and, alauddin, himself, was, a, heavy, drinker, as, part, of, his, measures, to, prevent, rebellions, alauddin, imposed, prohibition, because, he, believed, that, the, rampant, use, of, alcoholic, drinks, enabled, people, to, assemble, lose, their, senses, and, think, of, rebellion, according, to, isami, alauddin, banned, alcohol, after, a, noble, condemned, him, for, merrymaking, when, his, subjects, were, suffering, from, a, famine, however, this, account, appears, to, be, hearsay, subsequently, alauddin, also, banned, other, intoxicants, including, cannabis, he, also, banned, gambling, and, excommunicated, drunkards, and, gamblers, from, delhi, along, with, vendors, of, intoxicants, alauddin, s, administration, strictly, punished, the, violators, and, ensured, non, availability, of, alcohol, not, only, in, delhi, but, also, in, its, surrounding, areas, nevertheless, alcohol, continued, to, be, illegally, produced, in, and, smuggled, into, delhi, sometime, later, alauddin, relented, and, allowed, brewing, and, drinking, in, private, however, public, distribution, and, drinking, of, wine, remained, prohibited, alauddin, also, increased, his, level, of, control, over, the, nobility, to, prevent, rebellions, by, the, nobles, he, confiscated, their, wealth, and, removed, them, from, their, bases, of, power, even, charitable, lands, administered, by, nobles, were, confiscated, severe, punishments, were, given, for, disloyalty, even, wives, and, children, of, soldiers, rebelling, for, greater, war, spoils, were, imprisoned, an, efficient, spy, network, was, set, up, that, reached, into, the, private, households, of, nobles, marriage, alliances, made, between, noble, families, had, to, be, approved, by, the, king, alauddin, banned, prostitution, and, ordered, all, existing, prostitutes, of, delhi, to, be, married, firishta, states, that, he, classified, prostitutes, into, three, grades, and, fixed, their, fees, accordingly, however, historian, kishori, saran, lal, dismisses, this, account, as, inaccurate, alauddin, also, took, steps, to, curb, adultery, by, ordering, the, male, adulterer, to, be, castrated, and, the, female, adulterer, to, be, stoned, to, death, alauddin, banned, charlatans, and, ordered, sorcerers, called, blood, sucking, magicians, by, his, courtier, amir, khusrau, to, be, stoned, to, death, during, the, last, years, of, his, life, alauddin, had, an, illness, and, became, very, distrustful, of, his, officers, he, started, concentrating, all, the, power, in, the, hands, of, his, family, and, his, slaves, he, became, charmed, with, his, slave, general, malik, kafur, who, became, the, de, facto, ruler, of, the, sultanate, after, being, promoted, to, the, rank, of, viceroy, na, ib, alauddin, removed, several, experienced, administrators, abolished, the, office, of, wazir, prime, minister, and, even, executed, the, minister, sharaf, qa, ini, it, appears, that, malik, kafur, who, considered, these, officers, as, his, rivals, and, a, threat, convinced, alauddin, to, carry, out, this, purge, kafur, had, alauddin, s, eldest, sons, khizr, khan, and, shadi, khan, blinded, he, also, convinced, alauddin, to, order, the, killing, of, his, brother, in, law, alp, khan, an, influential, noble, who, could, rival, malik, kafur, s, power, the, victims, allegedly, hatched, a, conspiracy, to, overthrow, alauddin, but, this, might, be, kafur, s, propaganda, alauddin, died, on, the, night, of, 4, january, 1316, barani, claims, that, according, to, some, people, kafur, murdered, him, towards, the, end, of, the, night, kafur, brought, the, body, of, alauddin, from, the, siri, place, and, had, it, buried, in, alauddin, s, mausoleum, which, had, already, been, built, before, alauddin, s, death, the, mausoleum, is, said, to, have, been, located, outside, a, jama, mosque, but, neither, of, these, structures, can, be, identified, with, certainty, according, to, historian, banarsi, prasad, saksena, the, ruined, foundations, of, these, two, structures, probably, lie, under, one, of, the, mounds, at, siri, the, next, day, kafur, appointed, alauddin, s, young, son, shihabuddin, as, a, puppet, monarch, however, kafur, was, killed, shortly, after, and, alauddin, s, elder, son, mubarak, khan, seized, the, power, alauddin, s, tomb, and, the, madrasa, dedicated, to, him, exist, at, the, back, of, qutb, complex, mehrauli, in, delhi, alauddin, s, wives, included, jalaluddin, s, daughter, who, held, the, title, malika, i, jahan, and, alp, khan, s, sister, mahru, he, also, married, jhatyapali, the, daughter, of, hindu, king, ramachandra, of, devagiri, probably, after, the, 1296, devagiri, raid, or, after, his, 1308, conquest, of, devagiri, alauddin, had, a, son, with, jhatyapali, shihabuddin, omar, who, succeeded, him, as, the, next, khalji, ruler, alauddin, also, married, kamala, devi, a, hindu, woman, who, was, originally, the, chief, queen, of, karna, the, vaghela, king, of, gujarat, she, was, captured, by, khalji, forces, during, an, invasion, escorted, to, delhi, as, part, of, the, war, booty, and, taken, into, alauddin, s, harem, she, eventually, reconciled, to, her, new, life, according, to, the, chronicler, firishta, sometime, between, 1306, and, 1307, kamala, devi, requested, alauddin, to, secure, her, daughter, deval, devi, from, the, custody, of, her, father, raja, karan, alauddin, sent, an, order, to, raja, karan, telling, him, to, send, deval, devi, immediately, deval, devi, was, eventually, brought, to, delhi, and, lived, in, the, royal, palace, with, her, mother, malik, kafur, a, slave, captured, during, the, gujarat, campaign, caught, the, fancy, of, alauddin, he, rose, rapidly, in, alauddin, s, service, mainly, because, of, his, proven, ability, as, military, commander, and, wise, counsellor, and, eventually, became, the, viceroy, na, ib, of, the, sultanate, a, deep, emotional, bond, developed, between, alauddin, and, kafur, according, to, barani, during, the, last, four, or, five, years, of, his, life, alauddin, deeply, favoured, kafur, and, handed, over, the, administration, to, him, based, on, barani, s, description, scholars, ruth, vanita, and, saleem, kidwai, believe, that, alauddin, and, kafur, were, in, a, homosexual, relationship, historian, judith, e, walsh, scholar, nilanjan, sarkar, and, scholar, thomas, gugler, also, believe, alauddin, and, kafur, were, lovers, in, a, sexually, intimate, relationship, given, his, relationship, with, kafur, historians, believe, alauddin, may, have, been, bisexual, or, even, homosexual, historian, banarsi, prasad, saksena, believes, that, the, closeness, between, the, two, was, not, sexual, in, 1296, alauddin, constructed, the, hauz, i, alai, later, hauz, i, khas, water, reservoir, which, covered, an, area, of, 70, acres, and, had, a, stone, masonry, wall, gradually, it, became, filled, with, mud, and, was, desilted, by, firuz, shah, tughlaq, around, 1354, the, autobiographical, memoirs, of, timur, who, invaded, delhi, in, 1398, mention, that, the, reservoir, was, a, source, of, water, for, the, city, throughout, the, year, in, the, early, years, of, the, 14th, century, alauddin, built, the, siri, fort, the, fort, walls, were, mainly, constructed, using, rubble, in, mud, although, there, are, some, traces, of, ashlar, masonry, in, lime, and, lime, plaster, alauddin, camped, in, siri, during, the, 1303, mongol, invasion, and, after, the, mongols, left, he, built, the, qasr, i, hazar, situn, palace, at, the, site, of, his, camp, the, fortified, city, of, siri, existed, in, the, time, of, timur, whose, memoirs, state, that, it, had, seven, gates, the, destruction, of, the, fort, is, attributed, to, the, local, rulers, who, removed, the, fort, s, stones, bricks, and, other, artifacts, for, their, own, buildings, in, particular, sher, shah, suri, 1540, 1545, from, eastern, india, bihar, took, away, material, from, siri, to, build, his, own, city, alauddin, commissioned, the, alai, darwaza, which, was, completed, in, 1311, and, serves, as, the, southern, gateway, leading, to, the, quwwat, ul, islam, mosque, built, by, qutb, al, din, aibak, he, also, started, the, construction, of, the, alai, minar, which, was, intended, to, be, double, to, size, of, the, qutb, minar, but, the, project, was, abandoned, probably, when, he, died, the, construction, of, the, lal, mahal, red, palace, sandstone, building, near, chausath, khamba, has, also, been, attributed, to, alauddin, because, its, architecture, and, design, is, similar, to, that, of, the, alai, darwaza, in, 1311, alauddin, repaired, the, 100, acre, hauz, i, shamasi, reservoir, that, had, been, constructed, by, shamsuddin, iltutmish, in, 1229, and, also, built, a, dome, at, its, centre, like, his, predecessors, alauddin, was, a, sunni, muslim, his, administration, persecuted, the, ismaili, shia, minorities, after, the, orthodox, sunnis, falsely, accused, them, of, permitting, incest, in, their, secret, assemblies, alauddin, ordered, an, inquiry, against, them, sometime, before, 1311, the, inquiry, was, conducted, by, the, orthodox, ulama, who, found, several, ismailis, guilty, alauddin, ordered, the, convicts, to, be, sawn, into, two, ziauddin, barani, writing, half, a, century, after, his, death, mentions, that, alauddin, did, not, patronize, the, muslim, ulama, and, that, his, faith, in, islam, was, firm, like, the, faith, of, the, illiterate, and, the, ignorant, he, further, states, that, alauddin, once, thought, of, establishing, a, new, religion, just, like, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, s, four, rashidun, caliphs, helped, spread, islam, alauddin, believed, that, he, too, had, four, khans, ulugh, nusrat, zafar, and, alp, with, whose, help, he, could, establish, a, new, religion, barani, s, uncle, alaul, mulk, convinced, him, to, drop, this, idea, stating, that, a, new, religion, could, only, be, found, based, on, a, revelation, from, god, not, based, on, human, wisdom, alaul, mulk, also, argued, that, even, great, conquerors, like, genghis, khan, had, not, been, able, to, subvert, islam, and, people, would, revolt, against, alauddin, for, founding, a, new, religion, barani, s, claim, that, alauddin, thought, of, founding, a, religion, has, been, repeated, by, several, later, chroniclers, as, well, as, later, historians, historian, banarsi, prasad, saksena, doubts, the, authenticity, of, this, claim, arguing, that, it, is, not, supported, by, alauddin, s, contemporary, writers, according, to, barani, alauddin, was, the, first, sultan, to, separate, religion, from, the, state, barani, wrote, that, he, came, to, the, conclusion, that, polity, and, government, are, one, thing, and, the, rules, and, decrees, of, law, are, another, royal, commands, belong, to, the, king, legal, decrees, rest, upon, the, judgment, of, the, qazis, and, muftis, in, accordance, with, this, opinion, whatever, affair, of, state, came, before, him, he, only, looked, to, the, public, good, without, considering, whether, his, mode, of, dealing, with, it, was, lawful, or, unlawful, he, never, asked, for, legal, opinions, about, political, matters, and, very, few, learned, men, visited, him, historian, k, s, lal, disagrees, with, barani, mentioning, that, alauddin, had, great, faith, in, his, religion, and, never, permitted, anything, irreligious, to, be, said, the, 14th, century, indian, historian, and, court, poet, abdul, malik, isami, confirms, this, allaudin, realized, his, duties, as, a, king, to, him, this, kingly, office, was, divine, which, carried, a, lot, of, responsibilities, with, itself, for, he, was, very, thankful, to, god, almighty, moreover, as, a, muslim, he, believed, in, the, day, of, judgment, considered, himself, answerable, for, all, his, deeds, on, that, day, therefore, he, always, tried, his, best, to, do, the, deeds, which, were, acceptable, to, god, he, introduced, many, reforms, only, to, remove, the, sufferings, of, the, masses, irrespective, of, their, color, and, creed, so, that, he, could, win, the, pleasure, of, his, creator, at, times, he, exploited, muslim, fanaticism, against, hindu, chiefs, and, the, treatment, of, the, zimmis, persian, historian, wassaf, states, that, he, sent, an, expedition, against, gujarat, as, a, holy, war, and, it, was, not, motivated, by, lust, of, conquest, the, masnavi, deval, devi, khizr, khan, by, amir, khusrau, states, that, gujarat, was, only, annexed, in, the, second, invasion, which, took, place, seven, years, after, the, first, one, implying, the, first, was, merely, a, plundering, raid, at, khambhat, it, is, said, that, the, citizens, were, caught, by, surprise, wassaf, states, that, the, muhammadan, forces, began, to, kill, and, slaughter, on, the, right, and, on, the, left, unmercifully, throughout, the, impure, land, for, the, sake, of, islam, and, blood, flowed, in, torrents, alauddin, and, his, generals, destroyed, several, hindu, temples, during, their, military, campaigns, these, temples, included, the, ones, at, bhilsa, 1292, devagiri, 1295, vijapur, 1298, 1310, somnath, 1299, jhain, 1301, chidambaram, 1311, and, madurai, 1311, he, compromised, with, the, hindu, chiefs, who, were, willing, to, accept, his, suzerainty, in, a, 1305, document, khusrau, mentions, that, alauddin, treated, the, obedient, hindu, zamindars, feudal, landlords, kindly, and, granted, more, favours, to, them, than, they, had, expected, in, his, poetic, style, khusrau, states, that, by, this, time, all, the, insolent, hindus, in, the, realm, of, hind, had, died, on, the, battlefield, and, the, other, hindus, had, bowed, their, heads, before, alauddin, describing, a, court, held, on, 19, october, 1312, khusrau, writes, the, ground, had, become, saffron, coloured, from, the, tilaks, of, the, hindu, chiefs, bowing, before, alauddin, this, policy, of, compromise, with, hindus, was, greatly, criticized, by, a, small, but, vocal, set, of, muslim, extremists, as, apparent, from, barani, s, writings, alauddin, rarely, listened, to, the, advice, of, the, orthodox, ulama, when, he, had, asked, about, the, position, of, hindus, under, an, islamic,
