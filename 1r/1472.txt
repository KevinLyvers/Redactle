processed, at, dublin, s, richmond, barracks, by, g, men, plain, clothes, officers, from, dublin, metropolitan, police, during, his, screening, collins, was, identified, as, someone, who, should, be, selected, for, further, interrogation, harsher, treatment, or, execution, however, he, overheard, his, name, being, called, out, so, he, moved, to, the, other, side, of, the, building, to, identify, the, speaker, in, doing, so, he, joined, the, group, that, was, later, transferred, to, frongoch, internment, camp, in, wales, after, two, months, captivity, in, stafford, gaol, historian, tim, pat,

figure, in, the, vacuum, created, by, the, executions, of, the, 1916, leadership, he, began, hatching, plans, for, next, time, even, before, the, prison, ships, left, dublin, at, frongoch, he, was, one, of, the, organisers, of, a, programme, of, protest, and, non, cooperation, with, authorities, the, camp, proved, an, excellent, opportunity, for, networking, with, physical, force, republicans, from, all, over, the, country, of, which, he, became, a, key, organiser, while, some, celebrated, the, fact, that, a, rising, had, happened, at, all, believing, in, pearse, s, theory, of, blood,

movement, spearheaded, by, arthur, griffith, editor, publisher, of, the, main, nationalist, newspaper, the, united, irishman, which, collins, had, read, avidly, as, a, boy, griffith, s, organisation, sinn, f, in, was, founded, in, 1905, as, an, umbrella, group, to, unify, all, the, various, factions, within, the, nationalist, movement, under, griffith, s, policy, collins, and, other, advocates, of, the, physical, force, approach, to, independence, gained, the, cooperation, of, sinn, f, in, while, agreeing, to, disagree, with, griffith, s, moderate, ideas, of, a, dual, monarchy, solution, based, on, the, hungarian, model, the, british, government, and, mainstream, irish, media, had, wrongly, blamed, sinn, f, in, for, the, rising, this, attracted, rising, participants, to, join, the, organisation, in, order, to, exploit, the, reputation, with, which, such, british, propaganda, had, imbued, the, organisation, by, october, 1917, collins, had, risen, to, become, a, member, of, the, executive, of, sinn, f, in, and, director, of, organisation, for, the, irish, volunteers, amon, de, valera, another, veteran, of, 1916, stood, for, the, presidency, of, sinn, f, in, against, griffith,

formed, an, overwhelming, parliamentary, majority, in, ireland, like, many, senior, sinn, f, in, representatives, collins, was, elected, as, an, mp, for, cork, south, with, the, right, to, sit, in, the, house, of, commons, of, the, united, kingdom, in, london, unlike, their, rivals, in, the, irish, parliamentary, party, sinn, f, in, mps, had, announced, that, they, would, not, take, their, seats, in, westminster, but, instead, would, set, up, an, irish, parliament, in, dublin, before, the, new, body, s, first, meeting, collins, tipped, off, by, his, network, of, spies, warned, his, colleagues, of, plans, to, arrest, all, its, members, in, overnight, raids, de, valera, and, others, ignored, the, warnings, on, the, argument, that, if, the, arrests, happened, they, would, constitute, a, propaganda, coup, the, intelligence, proved, accurate, and, de, valera, along, with, sinn, f, in, mps, who, followed, his, advice, were, arrested, collins, and, others, evaded, incarceration, collins, reportedly, spent, time, hiding, among, dublin, s, jewish, community, even, posing, as, an, orthodox, jew, and, once, cursing, at, the, black, and, tans, in, yiddish, the, new,

time, most, of, the, d, il, ireann, s, ministries, existed, only, on, paper, or, as, one, or, two, individuals, working, in, a, room, of, a, private, house, as, large, gatherings, of, irish, republican, politicians, would, be, vulnerable, to, raid, attempts, by, british, crown, forces, despite, that, collins, managed, to, produce, a, finance, ministry, that, was, able, to, organise, a, large, bond, issue, in, the, form, of, a, national, loan, to, fund, the, new, irish, republic, according, to, batt, o, connor, the, d, il, loan, raised, almost, 400, 000, of, which, 25, 000, was, in,

volunteers, as, an, effective, military, force, and, concentrating, on, forcing, the, ric, which, represented, british, authority, in, ireland, out, of, isolated, barracks, and, seizing, their, weapons, collins, was, determined, to, avoid, the, massive, destruction, military, and, civilian, losses, for, merely, symbolic, victories, that, had, characterised, the, 1916, rising, instead, he, directed, a, guerrilla, war, against, the, british, suddenly, attacking, and, then, just, as, quickly, withdrawing, minimising, losses, and, maximising, effectiveness, the, crown, responded, with, an, escalation, of, the, war, with, the, importation, of, special, forces, such, as, the, auxiliaries, the, black, and, tans, the, cairo, gang, and, others, officially, or, unofficially, many, of, these,

who, had, been, elected, pr, omh, aire, by, the, d, il, was, first, referred, to, as, president, while, financially, successful, grave, political, conflicts, followed, in, de, valera, s, wake, there, which, threatened, the, unity, of, irish, american, support, for, the, rebels, some, members, of, the, irb, also, objected, to, the, use, of, the, presidential, title, because, their, organisation, s, constitution, had, a, different, definition, of, that, title, back, in, ireland, collins, arranged, the, national, loan, organised, the, ira, effectively, led, the, government, and, managed, arms, smuggling, operations, robert, briscoe, an, irish, jew, was, sent, by, collins, to, germany, in, 1919, to, be, the, chief, agent, for, procuring, arms, for, the, ira, while, in, germany, in, 1921, briscoe, purchased, a, small, tug, boat, named, frieda, to, be, used, in, transporting, guns, and, ammunition, to, ireland, on, 28, october, 1921, the, frieda, slipped, out, to, sea, with, charles,

were, also, regional, organisers, such, as, ernie, o, malley, and, liam, mellows, who, reported, directly, to, collins, at, st, ita, s, secret, basement, ghq, in, central, dublin, they, were, supported, by, a, vast, intelligence, network, of, men, and, women, in, all, walks, of, life, that, reached, deep, into, the, british, administration, in, ireland, it, was, at, this, time, that, collins, created, a, special, assassination, unit, called, the, squad, expressly, to, kill, british, agents, and, informers, collins, was, criticised, for, these, tactics, but, cited, the, universal, war, time, practice, of, executing, enemy, spies, who, were, in, his, words, hunting, victims, for, execution, campaigning, for, irish, independence, even, non, violently, was, still, targeted, both, by, prosecutions, under, british, law, entailing, the, death, penalty, and, also, by, extrajudicial, killings, such, as, that, of, tom, s, mac, curtain, nationalist, mayor, of, cork, city, in, 1920,

told, hamar, greenwood, after, signing, the, anglo, irish, treaty, you, had, us, dead, beat, we, could, not, have, lasted, another, three, weeks, when, we, were, told, of, the, offer, of, a, truce, we, were, astonished, we, thought, you, must, have, gone, mad, however, he, stated, on, the, record, that, there, will, be, no, compromise, and, no, negotiations, with, any, british, government, until, ireland, is, recognised, as, an, independent, republic, the, same, effort, that, would, get, us, dominion, home, rule, will, get, us, a, republic, at, no, time, had, the, d, il, or, the, ira, asked, for, a, conference, or, a, truce, however, the, d, il, as, a, whole, was, less, uncompromising, it, decided, to, proceed, to, a, peace, conference, although, it, was, ascertained, in, the, preliminary, stages, that, a, fully, independent, republic, would, not, be, on, the, table, and, that, the, loss, of, some, northeastern, counties, was, a, foregone, conclusion, many, of, the, rebel, forces, on, the, ground, first, heard, of, the, truce, when, it, was, announced, in, the, newspapers, and, this, gave, rise, to, the, first, fissures, in, nationalist, unity, which, had, serious, consequences, later, on, they, felt, they, had, not, been, included, in, consultations, regarding, its, terms, de, valera, was, widely, acknowledged, as, the, most, skilful, negotiator, on, the, d, il, government, side, and, he, participated, in, the, initial, parlays, agreeing, the, basis, on, which, talks, could, begin, the, first, meetings, were, held, in, strict, secrecy, soon, after, the, custom, house, battle, with, andrew, cope, representing, dublin, castle, s, british, authorities, later, de, valera, travelled, to, london, for, the, first, official, contact, with, lloyd, george, the, two, met, one, on, one, in, a, private, meeting, the, proceedings, of, which, have, never, been, revealed, during, this, truce, period, de, valera, sued, for, official, designation, as, president, of, the, irish, republic, and, obtained, it, from, the, d, il, in, august, 1921, in, place, of, the, title, which, had, previously, been, used, of, president, of, d, il, ireann, not, long, after, the, cabinet, was, obliged, to, select, the, delegation, that, would, travel, to, the, london, peace, conference, and, negotiate, a, treaty, in, a, departure, from, his, usual, role, de, valera, adamantly, declined, to, attend, insisting, instead, that, collins, should, take, his, place, there, along, with, arthur, griffith, collins, resisted, the, appointment, protesting, that, he, was, a, soldier, not, a, politician, and, that, his, exposure, to, the, london, authorities, would, reduce, his, effectiveness, as, a, guerrilla, leader, should, hostilities, resume, he, had, kept, his, public, visibility, to, a, minimum, during, the, conduct, of, the, war, up, to, this, time, the, british, still, had, very, few, reliable, photographs, of, him, the, cabinet, of, seven, split, on, the, issue, with, de, valera, casting, the, deciding, vote, many, of, collins, associates, warned, him, not, to, go, that, he, was, being, set, up, as, a, political, scapegoat, the, irish, delegates, sent, to, london, were, designated, as, plenipotentiaries, meaning, that, they, had, full, authority, to, sign, an, agreement, on, behalf, of, the, d, il, government, the, treaty, would, then, be, subject, to, approval, by, the, d, il, the, majority, of, the, delegates, including, arthur, griffith, leader, robert, barton, and, eamonn, duggan, with, erskine, childers, as, secretary, general, to, the, delegation, set, up, headquarters, at, 22, hans, place, in, knightsbridge, on, 11, october, 1921, collins, shared, quarters, at, 15, cadogan, gardens, with, the, delegation, s, publicity, department, secretary, diarmuid, o, hegarty, joseph, mcgrath, as, well, as, substantial, intelligence, and, bodyguard, personnel, including, liam, tobin, tom, cullen, eamon, broy, emmet, dalton, and, joseph, dolan, of, the, squad, the, british, team, were, led, by, their, prime, minister, lloyd, george, the, colonial, secretary, winston, churchill, and, f, e, smith, during, two, months, of, arduous, negotiations, the, irish, delegates, made, frequent, crossings, between, london, and, dublin, to, confer, with, their, d, il, colleagues, and, collins, correspondence, reflects, his, frustration, at, d, il, debates, and, the, irish, delegate, s, inability, to, agree, to, clear, instructions, as, to, whether, or, not, they, should, accept, a, treaty, in, november, with, the, london, peace, talks, still, in, progress, collins, attended, a, large, meeting, of, regional, ira, commanders, at, parnell, place, in, dublin, in, a, private, conference, he, informed, liam, deasy, florence, o, donoghue, and, liam, lynch, that, there, would, have, to, be, some, compromise, in, the, current, negotiations, in, london, there, was, no, question, of, our, getting, all, the, demands, we, were, making, he, was, advised, by, lynch, not, to, bring, this, out, in, the, full, assembly, reviewing, subsequent, events, deasy, later, doubted, the, wisdom, of, that, advice, the, negotiations, ultimately, resulted, in, the, anglo, irish, treaty, which, was, signed, on, 6, december, 1921, the, agreement, provided, for, a, dominion, status, irish, free, state, whose, relationship, to, the, british, commonwealth, would, be, modelled, after, canada, s, this, was, a, compromise, halfway, between, an, independent, republic, and, a, province, of, the, empire, the, treaty, was, signed, under, considerable, pressure, from, the, british, the, negotiators, had, agreed, at, the, cabinet, meeting, in, dublin, that, they, would, not, sign, the, treaty, without, bringing, it, back, for, the, d, il, cabinet, to, ratify, but, once, back, in, london, on, 5, december, at, 7, 30, pm, lloyd, george, told, them, it, was, immediate, signature, or, immediate, and, terrible, war, and, that, he, had, to, know, by, the, next, day, winston, churchill, recalled, collins, s, reaction, michael, collins, rose, as, if, he, was, going, to, shoot, someone, preferably, himself, in, all, my, life, i, have, never, seen, so, much, passion, and, suffering, in, restraint, the, treaty, was, signed, at, 2, 20, am, 6, december, 1921, the, settlement, overturned, the, act, of, union, by, recognising, the, native, irish, legislature, s, independence, under, a, bicameral, parliament, the, executive, authority, would, remain, vested, in, the, king, represented, in, ireland, by, a, governor, general, but, exercised, by, an, irish, government, elected, by, d, il, ireann, as, a, lower, house, british, forces, would, depart, the, free, state, forthwith, and, be, replaced, by, an, irish, army, along, with, an, independent, judiciary, the, treaty, granted, the, new, free, state, greater, independence, than, any, irish, state, and, went, well, beyond, the, home, rule, which, had, been, sought, by, charles, stewart, parnell, or, by, his, irish, parliamentary, party, successors, john, redmond, and, john, dillon, the, treaty, acknowledged, the, partition, of, ireland, before, treaty, negotiations, had, concluded, executive, powers, had, already, been, passed, to, the, government, of, northern, ireland, created, under, the, government, of, ireland, act, in, 1920, northern, ireland, which, had, a, majority, unionist, population, could, opt, out, of, the, free, state, a, year, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, an, irish, boundary, commission, was, to, be, established, to, draw, a, border, in, accordance, with, the, wishes, of, the, inhabitants, and, economic, and, geographic, conditions, collins, anticipated, a, redrawing, of, the, border, would, result, in, much, of, the, south, and, west, of, northern, ireland, becoming, part, of, the, free, state, making, northern, ireland, economically, non, viable, and, facilitating, the, reunification, of, the, 32, counties, in, the, near, future, collins, argued, that, he, had, signed, the, treaty, as, the, alternative, was, a, war, that, the, irish, people, did, not, want, i, say, that, rejection, of, the, treaty, is, a, declaration, of, war, until, you, have, beaten, the, british, empire, apart, from, any, alternative, document, rejection, of, the, treaty, means, your, national, policy, is, war, the, treaty, was, signed, by, me, not, because, they, held, up, the, alternative, of, immediate, war, i, signed, it, because, i, would, not, be, one, of, those, to, commit, the, irish, people, to, war, without, the, irish, people, committing, themselves, to, war, while, the, treaty, fell, short, of, the, republic, for, which, he, had, fought, collins, concluded, that, the, treaty, offered, ireland, not, the, freedom, that, all, nations, desire, and, develop, to, but, the, freedom, to, achieve, it, nonetheless, he, knew, that, elements, of, the, treaty, would, cause, controversy, in, ireland, upon, signing, the, treaty, f, e, smith, remarked, i, may, have, signed, my, political, death, warrant, tonight, collins, replied, i, may, have, signed, my, actual, death, warrant, this, remark, encapsulated, his, acknowledgement, that, the, treaty, was, a, compromise, that, would, be, vulnerable, to, charges, of, sell, out, from, purist, republicans, it, did, not, establish, the, fully, independent, republic, that, collins, himself, had, shortly, before, demanded, as, a, non, negotiable, condition, the, physical, force, republicans, who, made, up, the, bulk, of, the, army, which, had, fought, the, british, to, a, draw, would, be, loath, to, accept, dominion, status, within, the, british, empire, or, an, oath, of, allegiance, that, mentioned, the, king, also, controversial, was, the, british, retention, of, treaty, ports, on, the, south, coast, of, ireland, for, the, royal, navy, these, factors, diminished, irish, sovereignty, and, threatened, to, allow, british, interference, in, ireland, s, foreign, policy, collins, and, griffith, were, well, aware, of, these, issues, and, strove, tenaciously, against, british, resistance, to, achieve, language, which, could, be, accepted, by, all, constituents, they, succeeded, in, obtaining, an, oath, to, the, irish, free, state, with, a, subsidiary, oath, of, fidelity, to, the, king, rather, than, to, the, king, unilaterally, amon, de, valera, the, president, of, the, d, il, objected, to, the, treaty, on, the, grounds, that, it, had, been, signed, without, cabinet, consent, and, that, it, secured, neither, the, full, independence, of, ireland, nor, irish, unity, collins, and, his, supporters, argued, that, de, valera, had, refused, strenuous, pleas, from, collins, griffith, and, others, to, lead, the, london, negotiations, in, person, he, had, refused, the, delegates, continual, requests, for, instruction, and, in, fact, had, been, at, the, centre, of, the, original, decision, to, enter, negotiations, without, the, possibility, of, an, independent, republic, on, the, table, the, treaty, controversy, split, the, entire, nationalist, movement, sinn, f, in, the, d, il, the, irb, and, the, army, each, divided, into, pro, and, anti, treaty, factions, the, supreme, council, of, the, irb, had, been, informed, in, detail, about, every, facet, of, the, treaty, negotiations, and, had, approved, many, of, its, provisions, and, all, but, one, voted, to, accept, the, treaty, the, single, exception, being, liam, lynch, later, chief, of, staff, of, the, anti, treaty, ira, the, d, il, debated, the, treaty, bitterly, for, ten, days, until, it, was, approved, by, a, vote, of, 64, to, 57, having, lost, this, vote, de, valera, announced, his, intent, to, withdraw, his, participation, from, the, d, il, and, called, on, all, deputies, who, had, voted, against, the, treaty, to, follow, him, a, substantial, number, did, so, officially, splitting, the, government, a, large, part, of, the, irish, republican, army, opposed, the, treaty, and, in, march, 1922, voted, at, an, army, convention, to, reject, the, authority, of, the, dail, collins, ghq, and, to, elect, their, own, executive, anti, treaty, ira, units, began, to, seize, buildings, and, take, other, guerrilla, actions, against, the, provisional, government, on, 14, april, 1922, a, group, of, 200, anti, treaty, ira, men, occupied, the, four, courts, in, dublin, under, rory, o, connor, a, hero, of, the, war, of, independence, the, four, courts, was, the, centre, of, the, irish, courts, system, originally, under, the, british, and, then, the, free, state, collins, was, charged, by, his, free, state, colleagues, with, putting, down, these, insurgents, however, he, resisted, firing, on, former, comrades, and, staved, off, a, shooting, war, throughout, this, period, while, the, country, teetered, on, the, edge, of, civil, war, continuous, meetings, were, carried, on, among, the, various, factions, from, january, to, june, 1922, in, these, discussions, the, nationalists, strove, to, resolve, the, issue, without, armed, conflict, collins, and, his, close, associate, teachta, d, la, td, harry, boland, were, among, those, who, worked, desperately, to, heal, the, rift, to, foster, military, unity, collins, and, the, irb, established, an, army, re, unification, committee, including, delegates, from, pro, and, anti, treaty, factions, the, still, secret, irish, republican, brotherhood, continued, to, meet, fostering, dialogue, between, pro, and, anti, treaty, ira, officers, in, the, irb, s, stormy, debates, on, the, subject, collins, held, out, the, constitution, of, the, new, free, state, as, a, possible, solution, collins, was, then, in, the, process, of, co, writing, that, document, and, was, striving, to, make, it, a, republican, constitution, that, included, provisions, that, would, allow, anti, treaty, tds, to, take, their, seats, in, good, conscience, without, any, oath, concerning, the, crown, since, june, 1920, communal, conflict, had, been, raging, in, north, east, ulster, between, the, protestant, unionist, majority, there, who, wanted, to, remain, part, of, the, uk, and, the, catholic, irish, nationalist, minority, who, backed, irish, independence, belfast, saw, savage, and, unprecedented, sectarian, violence, protestant, loyalists, attacked, the, catholic, community, in, retaliation, for, ira, actions, more, than, 500, people, were, killed, more, than, 8, 000, workers, were, driven, out, of, their, jobs, and, more, than, 10, 000, became, refugees, mostly, from, the, catholic, minority, see, the, troubles, in, northern, ireland, 1920, 1922, after, the, death, of, collins, his, concern, for, the, plight, of, northern, catholics, was, made, clear, by, the, belfast, ira, commander, seamus, woods, of, all, the, dublin, government, ministers, collins, had, been, most, deeply, concerned, about, the, fate, of, northern, catholics, in, may, 1921, ireland, was, partitioned, under, british, law, creating, northern, ireland, and, unionists, formed, a, northern, government, in, early, 1922, there, were, clashes, along, the, new, border, between, the, ira, on, the, southern, side, and, ulster, special, constabulary, usc, on, the, northern, side, as, well, as, a, resurgence, of, sectarian, violence, in, belfast, collins, strongly, opposed, partition, but, he, was, ambiguous, about, his, policy, for, undoing, it, on, one, hand, he, told, the, d, il, during, the, treaty, debates, we, have, stated, we, would, not, coerce, the, north, east, surely, we, recognise, that, the, north, east, corner, does, exist, the, treaty, has, made, an, effort, to, deal, with, it, on, lines, that, will, lead, very, rapidly, to, goodwill, and, the, entry, of, the, north, east, under, the, irish, parliament, the, pro, treaty, side, argued, that, the, proposed, irish, boundary, commission, would, give, large, swathes, of, northern, ireland, to, the, free, state, leaving, the, remaining, territory, too, small, to, be, economically, viable, however, in, private, collins, told, the, northern, divisions, of, the, ira, early, in, 1922, that, although, the, treaty, might, have, seemed, an, outward, expression, of, partition, the, government, plans, to, make, it, impossible, partition, would, never, be, recognised, even, if, it, meant, smashing, the, treaty, in, january, 1922, six, months, after, the, ceasefire, truce, collins, helped, to, form, an, ulster, council, within, the, ira, which, included, the, commanders, of, its, five, northern, divisions, to, co, ordinate, ira, activity, in, the, north, collins, provisional, government, also, funded, northern, county, councils, and, paid, the, salaries, of, teachers, in, northern, ireland, who, recognised, the, free, state, in, march, collins, met, sir, james, craig, prime, minister, of, northern, ireland, in, london, they, signed, an, agreement, declaring, peace, in, the, north, which, promised, cooperation, between, catholics, and, protestants, in, policing, and, security, and, a, generous, budget, for, restoring, catholics, to, homes, which, had, been, destroyed, to, some, northern, republicans, collins, had, formally, recognized, partition, and, had, done, so, without, consulting, them, the, day, after, the, agreement, was, published, violence, erupted, again, in, the, arnon, street, killings, a, policeman, was, shot, dead, in, belfast, and, in, reprisal, police, broke, into, catholic, homes, nearby, and, shot, residents, in, their, beds, including, children, see, mcmahon, killings, there, was, no, response, to, collins, demands, for, an, inquiry, he, and, his, cabinet, warned, that, they, would, deem, the, agreement, broken, unless, craig, took, action, in, his, continual, correspondence, with, churchill, over, violence, in, the, north, collins, protested, repeatedly, that, such, breaches, of, the, truce, threatened, to, invalidate, the, treaty, entirely, the, prospect, was, real, enough, that, on, 3, june, 1922, churchill, presented, to, the, committee, of, imperial, defence, his, plans, to, protect, ulster, from, invasion, by, the, south, in, spring, 1922, collins, along, with, other, irb, and, ira, leaders, developed, secret, plans, for, a, guerrilla, offensive, in, northern, ireland, it, was, to, involve, both, pro, and, anti, treaty, ira, units, collins, hoped, the, offensive, would, undermine, the, northern, ireland, government, and, unite, the, pro, and, anti, treaty, ira, in, a, shared, goal, collins, and, national, army, ghq, secretly, supplied, weaponry, and, equipment, for, the, offensive, and, some, british, arms, that, had, been, supplied, to, the, provisional, government, were, passed, on, to, the, ira, because, of, this, most, northern, ira, units, supported, collins, and, 524, individual, volunteers, came, south, to, join, the, national, army, in, the, irish, civil, war, the, offensive, was, to, begin, on, 2, may, 1922, but, most, of, the, ira, divisions, had, to, postpone, until, later, in, the, month, the, 1st, 4th, and, 5th, divisions, based, in, southern, territory, did, not, take, part, this, and, the, staggered, start, to, the, offensive, made, it, easier, for, the, northern, authorities, to, tackle, the, northern, government, launched, a, massive, security, crackdown, and, introduced, internment, which, would, cripple, the, ira, in, northern, ireland, the, offensive, saw, the, battle, of, pettigo, and, belleek, in, early, june, which, ended, with, british, troops, shelling, ira, positions, on, the, border, collins, chided, pro, treaty, ira, units, who, became, embroiled, in, the, fighting, and, the, provisional, government, issued, an, order, that, their, policy, was, peaceful, obstruction, and, no, troops, from, the, twenty, six, counties, either, official, or, attached, to, the, executive, should, be, permitted, to, invade, the, six, county, area, however, in, early, august, collins, wrote, to, cosgrave, i, am, forced, to, the, conclusion, that, we, may, yet, have, to, fight, the, british, in, the, north, east, at, the, same, time, he, told, northern, ira, officers, he, would, use, the, political, arm, against, craig, so, long, as, it, is, of, use, if, that, fails, the, treaty, can, go, to, hell, and, we, will, all, start, again, after, the, death, of, collins, aid, from, the, provisional, government, to, the, northern, ira, was, cut, off, belfast, brigade, ira, leader, roger, mccorley, stated, when, collins, was, killed, the, northern, element, gave, up, all, hope, de, valera, resigned, the, presidency, and, sought, re, election, but, arthur, griffith, replaced, him, after, a, close, vote, on, 9, january, 1922, griffith, chose, as, his, title, president, of, d, il, ireann, rather, than, president, of, the, republic, as, de, valera, had, favoured, the, d, il, ireann, government, did, not, hold, legal, status, in, british, constitutional, law, the, provisions, of, the, treaty, required, the, formation, of, a, new, government, established, under, british, law, with, royal, assent, which, would, be, recognised, by, westminster, as, pertaining, to, the, free, state, dominion, that, had, been, agreed, under, the, treaty, despite, the, abdication, of, a, large, part, of, the, d, il, the, provisional, government, rialtas, sealadach, na, h, ireann, was, formed, with, michael, collins, as, chairman, of, the, cabinet, effectively, prime, minister, the, provisional, government, operated, concurrently, with, the, d, il, ireann, government, under, griffith, collins, retained, his, position, as, minister, for, finance, in, both, governments, in, british, legal, tradition, collins, was, now, a, crown, appointed, prime, minister, of, a, commonwealth, dominion, installed, under, the, royal, prerogative, to, be, so, installed, he, had, to, formally, meet, the, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, viscount, fitzalan, the, head, of, the, british, administration, in, ireland, the, republican, view, of, the, same, meeting, is, that, collins, met, fitzalan, to, accept, the, surrender, of, dublin, castle, the, official, seat, of, the, british, government, in, ireland, having, surrendered, fitzalan, still, remained, in, place, as, viceroy, until, december, 1922, the, provisional, government, s, first, obligation, was, to, create, a, constitution, for, the, free, state, this, was, undertaken, by, collins, and, a, team, of, solicitors, the, outcome, of, their, work, became, the, irish, constitution, of, 1922, he, drew, up, a, republican, constitution, which, without, repudiating, the, treaty, would, include, no, mention, of, the, british, king, his, object, was, that, the, constitution, would, allow, participation, in, the, d, il, by, dissenting, tds, who, opposed, the, treaty, and, refused, to, take, any, oath, recognising, the, crown, under, the, treaty, the, free, state, was, obliged, to, submit, its, new, constitution, to, westminster, for, approval, upon, doing, so, in, june, 1922, collins, and, griffith, found, lloyd, george, determined, to, veto, the, provisions, they, had, fashioned, to, prevent, civil, war, the, meetings, with, lloyd, george, and, churchill, were, bitter, and, contentious, collins, although, less, diplomatic, than, griffith, or, de, valera, had, no, less, penetrating, comprehension, of, political, issues, he, complained, that, he, was, being, manipulated, into, doing, churchill, s, dirty, work, in, a, potential, civil, war, with, his, own, former, troops, negotiations, to, prevent, civil, war, resulted, in, among, others, the, army, document, published, in, may, 1922, which, was, signed, by, an, equal, number, of, pro, and, anti, treaty, ira, officers, including, collins, dan, breen, and, gear, id, o, sullivan, this, manifesto, declared, that, a, closing, of, ranks, all, round, is, necessary, to, prevent, the, greatest, catastrophe, in, irish, history, it, called, for, new, elections, to, be, followed, by, the, re, unification, of, the, government, and, army, whatever, the, result, in, this, spirit, and, with, the, organising, efforts, of, moderates, on, both, sides, the, collins, de, valera, pact, was, created, this, pact, agreed, that, new, elections, to, the, d, il, would, be, held, with, each, candidate, running, as, explicitly, pro, or, anti, treaty, and, that, regardless, of, which, side, obtained, a, majority, the, two, factions, would, then, join, to, form, a, coalition, government, of, national, unity, a, referendum, on, the, treaty, was, also, planned, but, it, never, took, place, the, pact, elections, on, 16, june, 1922, therefore, comprise, the, best, quantitative, record, of, the, irish, public, s, response, to, the, treaty, the, results, were, pro, treaty, 58, seats, anti, treaty, 36, labour, party, 17, independents, 6, farmers, party, 7, plus, 4, unionists, from, trinity, college, dublin, six, days, after, the, pact, elections, sir, henry, wilson, was, assassinated, by, reginald, dunne, and, joseph, o, sullivan, two, london, based, ira, volunteers, who, had, served, in, world, war, i, in, which, o, sullivan, had, lost, a, leg, outside, wilson, s, home, at, 36, eaton, place, at, approximately, 2, 20, pm, he, was, in, full, uniform, as, he, was, returning, from, unveiling,

suffered, six, wounds, two, of, them, fatal, to, the, chest, two, police, officers, and, a, chauffeur, were, also, shot, as, the, two, assassins, sought, to, avoid, capture, they, were, then, surrounded, by, a, crowd, and, arrested, by, other, policemen, after, a, struggle, dunne, and, o, sullivan, were, convicted, of, murder, and, hanged, on, 10, august, 1922, a, british, army, field, marshal, wilson, had, recently, resigned, his, commission, and, been, elected, an, mp, for, a, constituency, in, northern, ireland, he, had, a, long, history, as, one, of, the, chief, british, leaders, opposing, collins, in, the, irish, conflict, at, that, time, wilson, had, served, as, military, advisor, to, the, northern, ireland, government, led, by, james, craig, in, which, role, he, was, seen, to, be, responsible, for, the, b, specials, and, for, other, sources, of, loyalist, violence, in, the, north, the, debate, concerning, collins, involvement, continued, in, the, 1950s, when, a, number, of, statements, and, rebuttals, on, the, subject, were, published, in, periodicals, these, were, reprinted, with, additions, in, rex, taylor, s, 1961, book, assassination, the, death, of, sir, henry, wilson, and, the, tragedy, of, ireland, participants, in, that, discussion, were, joe, dolan, florence, o, donoghue, denis, p, kelleher, patrick, o, sullivan, and, others, the, death, of, sir, henry, wilson, caused, a, furore, in, london, lloyd, george, the, prime, minister, sent, a, letter, to, collins, saying, that, the, ambiguous, position, of, the, provisional, government, with, regard, to, the, ira, in, the, four, courts, could, no, longer, be, tolerated, the, british, cabinet, met, the, day, after, the, assassination, and, agreed, that, collins, reply, had, not, given, a, definite, enough, commitment, to, disperse, the, four, courts, occupation, they, ordered, nevil, macready, commander, of, the, british, garrison, still, in, dublin, to, attack, the, four, courts, whose, republican, garrison, they, blamed, for, the, shooting, of, wilson, the, plan, was, put, on, hold, at, the, last, minute, when, macready, advised, the, government, on, 26, june, to, give, collins, provisional, government, one, more, chance, to, act, against, the, four, courts, collins, himself, was, in, cork, at, the, time, of, the, crisis, president, arthur, griffith, and, military, officer, emmet, dalton, met, with, british, officials, to, discuss, the, continued, occupation, of, the, four, courts, by, the, irregulars, under, rory, o, connor, there, is, little, documentation, of, the, decision, taken, by, the, provisional, government, headed, by, collins, to, attack, the, four, courts, historian, michael, hopkinson, writes, the, scarcity, of, evidence, is, explained, by, the, acute, sensitivity, of, the, subject, both, at, the, time, and, since, when, collins, arrived, back, in, dublin, his, forces, began, to, act, against, the, anti, treatyites, on, 27, june, they, arrested, anti, treaty, ira, officer, leo, henderson, as, he, was, enforcing, the, belfast, boycott, by, seizing, cars, in, retaliation, the, anti, treaty, ira, men, abducted, j, j, ginger, o, connell, a, free, state, general, and, held, him, in, the, four, courts, these, two, developments, led, to, the, provisional, government, s, 27, june, 1922, order, serving, notice, on, the, four, courts, garrison, to, surrender, the, building, their, arms, and, release, o, connell, that, night, or, face, military, action, at, once, according, to, historian, charles, townsend, collins, must, have, consented, to, this, though, the, actual, decision, seems, to, have, been, taken, by, griffith, peter, hart, similarly, writes, it, was, griffith, rather, than, collins, who, took, the, lead, in, this, decision, however, a, contemporary, observer, of, events, cabinet, member, ernest, blythe, contradicts, the, historians, recalling, that, the, decision, to, attack, the, four, courts, was, almost, automatic, once, collins, had, agreed, to, it, collins, position, in, this, conflict, was, extraordinary, indeed, a, majority, of, the, ira, he, had, helped, lead, in, the, war, of, independence, were, now, ranged, against, the, provisional, government, which, he, led, in, addition, the, force, which, by, the, will, of, the, electorate, he, was, obliged, to, lead, had, been, re, organised, since, the, truce, formed, from, a, nucleus, of, pro, treaty, ira, men, it, had, evolved, into, a, more, formal, structured, uniformed, national, army, that, was, armed, and, funded, by, britain, many, of, the, new, members, were, world, war, i, veterans, and, others, who, had, not, fought, on, the, nationalist, side, before, collins, profoundly, mixed, feelings, about, this, situation, are, recorded, in, his, private, and, official, correspondence, artillery, was, provided, to, richard, mulcahy, as, minister, for, defence, and, the, free, state, army, by, the, british, for, the, purposes, of, attacking, the, four, courts, emmet, dalton, an, irishman, who, had, served, in, the, british, army, and, the, ira, who, was, now, a, leading, free, state, commander, and, close, associate, of, collins, was, placed, in, charge, of, it, the, four, courts, surrendered, after, three, days, of, fighting, heavy, fighting, broke, out, in, dublin, between, the, anti, treaty, ira, dublin, brigade, and, the, free, state, troops, much, of, o, connell, street, suffered, heavy, damage, the, gresham, hotel, was, burned, and, the, four, courts, reduced, to, a, ruin, still, under, collins, direction, the, free, state, rapidly, took, control, of, the, capital, by, july, 1922, anti, treaty, forces, held, much, of, the, southern, province, of, munster, and, several, other, areas, of, the, country, at, the, height, of, their, success, they, administered, local, government, and, policing, in, large, regions, collins, richard, mulcahy, and, eoin, o, duffy, decided, on, a, series, of, seaborne, landings, into, republican, held, areas, which, re, took, munster, and, the, west, in, july, august, that, july, collins, became, commander, in, chief, of, the, national, army, while, also, retaining, his, civilian, roles, as, minister, of, finance, and, chairman, of, the, provisional, government, however, according, to, charles, townshend, he, became, a, kind, of, generalissimo, combining, military, and, political, supremacy, griffith, had, no, desire, or, capacity, to, dispute, the, day, to, day, conduct, of, government, with, him, and, while, mulcahy, had, great, administrative, capacity, he, deferred, to, collins, as, a, strategist, and, thinker, he, also, prorogued, the, meeting, of, the, dail, until, the, end, of, hostilities, a, move, that, historians, such, as, john, m, regan, have, seen, as, an, unconstitutional, concentration, of, power, in, collins, himself, and, his, military, colleagues, on, 12, july, the, pro, treaty, army, formed, a, war, council, of, three, led, by, collins, with, richard, mulcahy, and, eoin, o, duffy, at, the, same, time, martial, law, was, introduced, but, not, proclaimed, until, january, 1923, at, this, time, collins, was, president, of, the, irb, supreme, council, which, claimed, to, be, the, legitimate, government, of, the, irish, republic, commander, in, chief, of, the, pro, treaty, army, while, retaining, control, of, the, provisional, government, which, remained, unaccountable, to, any, government, in, september, on, the, pro, treaty, side, collins, controlled, civil, military, and, the, extra, constitutional, powers, of, the, irb, the, irb, executive, which, acted, as, the, irb, government, when, the, supreme, council, was, not, sitting, closely, resembled, the, war, council, of, three, with, collins, and, o, duffy, sitting, on, both, the, third, member, of, the, irb, executive, was, sean, o, muithile, who, collins, appointed, as, the, commissioner, of, the, new, police, force, shortly, before, collins, was, killed, in, action, the, appointment, was, later, rescinded, roughly, two, weeks, after, cork, city, had, been, taken, by, provisional, government, forces, collins, travelled, there, to, attempt, to, seize, large, sums, of, money, that, the, anti, treaty, republicans, had, lodged, in, various, banks, under, the, account, of, the, land, bank, there, is, also, considerable, evidence, that, collins, journey, to, cork, in, august, 1922, was, made, in, order, to, meet, republican, leaders, with, a, view, to, ending, the, war, collins, also, conducted, a, series, of, meetings, regarding, the, possibility, of, peace, talks, in, cork, on, 21, 22, august, 1922, in, cork, city, collins, met, with, neutral, ira, members, se, n, o, hegarty, and, florence, o, donoghue, with, a, view, to, contacting, anti, treaty, ira, leaders, tom, barry, and, tom, hales, to, propose, a, truce, the, anti, treaty, side, had, called, a, major, convocation, of, officers, to, b, al, na, bl, th, a, remote, crossroads, with, ending, the, war, on, the, agenda, de, valera, was, present, there, however, michel, hopkinson, writes, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, there, was, any, prospect, of, a, meeting, between, de, valera, and, collins, the, people, s, rights, association, a, local, initiative, in, cork, city, had, been, mediating, a, discussion, of, terms, between, the, provisional, government, and, the, anti, treaty, side, for, some, weeks, collins, personal, diary, outlined, his, proposals, for, peace, republicans, must, accept, the, people, s, verdict, on, the, treaty, but, could, then, go, home, without, their, arms, we, don, t, ask, for, any, surrender, of, their, principles, he, argued, that, the, provisional, government, was, upholding, the, people, s, rights, and, would, continue, to, do, so, we, want, to, avoid, any, possible, unnecessary, destruction, and, loss, of, life, we, do, not, want, to, mitigate, their, weakness, by, resolute, action, beyond, what, is, required, but, if, republicans, did, not, accept, his, terms, further, blood, is, on, their, shoulders, in, august, 1922, it, seemed, as, though, the, civil, war, was, winding, down, the, free, state, had, regained, control, of, most, of, the, country, and, collins, was, making, frequent, trips, to, inspect, areas, recently, recovered, from, anti, treaty, forces, his, plan, to, travel, to, his, native, cork, on, 20, august, was, considered, particularly, dangerous, and, he, was, strenuously, advised, against, it, by, several, trusted, associates, county, cork, was, an, ira, stronghold, as, much, of, it, was, still, held, by, anti, treaty, forces, yet, he, was, determined, to, make, the, trip, without, delay, he, had, fended, off, a, number, of, attempts, on, his, life, in, the, preceding, weeks, and, had, acknowledged, more, than, once, in, private, conversation, that, the, civil, war, might, end, his, life, at, any, moment, on, several, occasions, collins, assured, his, advisors, they, won, t, shoot, me, in, my, own, county, or, words, to, that, effect, on, 22, august, 1922, collins, set, out, from, cork, city, on, a, circuitous, tour, of, west, cork, he, passed, first, through, macroom, and, then, took, the, bandon, road, via, crookstown, this, led, through, b, al, na, bl, th, an, isolated, crossroads, there, they, stopped, at, a, local, pub, named, long, s, pub, now, known, as, the, diamond, bar, to, ask, a, question, of, a, man, standing, at, the, crossroad, the, man, turned, out, to, be, an, anti, treaty, sentry, he, and, an, associate, recognised, collins, in, the, back, of, the, open, top, car, as, a, result, an, ambush, was, laid, by, an, anti, treaty, column, at, that, point, on, the, chance, that, the, convoy, might, come, through, again, on, their, return, journey, between, 7, 30, and, 8, 00, pm, collins, convoy, approached, b, al, na, bl, th, for, the, second, time, by, then, most, of, the, ambush, party, had, dispersed, and, gone, for, the, day, leaving, just, five, or, six, men, on, the, scene, two, were, disarming, a, mine, in, the, road, while, three, on, a, laneway, overlooking, them, provided, cover, a, dray, cart, placed, across, the, road, remained, at, the, far, end, of, the, ambush, site, the, irregulars, in, the, laneway, opened, fire, with, rifles, on, the, convoy, emmet, dalton, the, free, state, commander, for, the, county, ordered, the, driver, of, the, touring, car, to, drive, like, hell, but, collins, said, no, stop, and, we, ll, fight, em, he, then, jumped, from, the, vehicle, along, with, the, others, at, first, the, group, took, cover, behind, a, low, grass, bank, bordering, the, road, but, collins, then, jumped, up, and, ran, back, along, the, road, to, begin, firing, with, his, lee, enfield, rifle, from, behind, the, armoured, car, the, vickers, machine, gun, in, that, car, had, also, been, firing, at, the, attackers, but, then, stopped, because, a, badly, loaded, ammunition, belt, caused, it, to, jam, apparently, to, get, a, better, view, of, the, laneway, up, which, he, had, seen, the, enemy, running, collins, left, the, protection, of, the, armoured, car, and, moved, even, farther, back, around, a, bend, in, the, road, out, of, sight, of, his, comrades, now, standing, in, the, open, he, fired, a, couple, of, shots, and, as, he, was, once, more, working, the, bolt, of, his, rifle, he, was, struck, in, the, head, by, a, bullet, believed, to, have, been, fired, by, one, of, the, ambushing, party, denis, sonny, o, neill, a, former, british, army, sniper, collins, was, the, only, fatality, sustained, in, the, ambush, although, another, member, of, his, party, suffered, a, neck, wound, after, he, was, shot, the, fire, from, the, ambushing, party, quickly, fell, off, and, they, withdrew, from, the, scene, collins, was, found, face, down, on, the, roadway, one, of, his, men, whispered, an, act, of, contrition, into, his, ear, but, collins, was, clearly, close, to, death, if, not, already, dead, he, was, lifted, into, the, back, of, the, touring, car, with, his, head, resting, against, dalton, s, shoulder, the, convoy, cleared, the, dray, cart, obstruction, and, resumed, its, journey, to, cork, the, lengthy, time, the, convoy, took, to, cover, the, twenty, miles, 32, km, back, to, cork, city, was, because, many, of, the, roads, were, blocked, and, the, convoy, had, to, travel, across, muddy, fields, and, through, farms, to, circumnavigate, the, obstacles, all, in, darkness, at, times, when, the, vehicles, became, bogged, down, members, of, the, convoy, had, to, carry, collins, body, on, their, shoulders, the, touring, car, eventually, had, to, be, abandoned, because, of, mechanical, trouble, there, was, no, autopsy, collins, field, diary, was, taken, by, dalton, who, had, been, with, him, during, his, tour, of, the, south, the, body, was, first, presented, at, shanakiel, hospital, in, cork, a, small, military, establishment, and, then, shipped, around, the, coast, to, dublin, where, it, was, laid, out, in, st, vincent, s, hospital, dublin, from, there, it, was, removed, to, the, city, hall, beside, dublin, castle, where, it, was, laid, in, state, numerous, questions, remain, about, the, events, surrounding, the, death, of, collins, because, the, only, witnesses, to, his, death, were, the, members, of, the, free, state, army, convoy, and, the, anti, treaty, ambushers, as, no, two, stories, match, and, participant, statements, from, both, sides, are, contradictory, and, inconsistent, unanswered, questions, linger, about, what, happened, that, day, the, man, generally, believed, to, have, fired, the, fatal, shot, at, b, al, na, bl, th, denis, sonny, o, neill, was, a, former, officer, from, the, royal, irish, constabulary, who, served, as, a, sniper, in, the, british, army, during, the, first, world, war, o, neill, had, joined, the, ira, in, 1918, and, had, met, collins, on, more, than, one, occasion, however, when, the, irish, civil, war, started, in, june, 1922, o, neill, joined, the, anti, treaty, ira, o, neill, remains, a, mysterious, figure, because, of, the, contradictions, in, his, biography, such, as, serving, in, the, british, army, but, then, joining, the, ira, he, provided, them, with, information, concerning, the, igoe, gang, that, worked, for, the, british, army, intelligence, centre, in, the, 1940s, twenty, years, after, collins, death, the, irish, state, granted, o, neill, a, captain, s, military, pension, collins, lay, in, state, for, three, days, tens, of, thousands, of, mourners, filed, past, his, coffin, to, pay, their, respects, including, many, british, soldiers, departing, ireland, who, had, fought, against, him, his, funeral, mass, took, place, at, dublin, s, st, mary, s, pro, cathedral, where, a, number, of, foreign, and, irish, dignitaries, were, in, attendance, some, 500, 000, people, attended, his, funeral, almost, one, fifth, of, the, country, s, population, at, that, time, no, official, inquiry, was, ever, undertaken, into, collins, death, and, consequently, there, is, no, official, version, of, what, happened, nor, are, there, any, authoritative, detailed, contemporary, records, de, valera, is, alleged, to, have, declared, in, 1966, it, is, my, considered, opinion, that, in, the, fullness, of, time, history, will, record, the, greatness, of, michael, collins, and, it, will, be, recorded, at, my, expense, however, there, is, no, evidence, he, ever, made, this, remark, collins, elderly, father, who, was, 75, when, his, youngest, child, was, born, inspired, his, fondness, and, respect, for, older, people, his, mother, who, had, spent, her, youth, caring, for, her, own, invalid, mother, and, raising, her, own, brothers, and, sisters, was, a, powerful, influence, the, entire, management, of, the, collins, farm, fell, to, her, as, her, husband, succumbed, to, old, age, and, died, in, a, society, which, honoured, hospitality, as, a, prime, virtue, mrs, collins, was, eulogised, as, a, hostess, in, ten, thousand, her, five, daughters, avowedly, doted, on, their, youngest, brother, he, enjoyed, rough, housing, and, outdoor, sports, having, won, a, local, wrestling, championship, while, he, was, still, a, boy, he, is, said, to, have, made, a, pastime, of, challenging, larger, older, opponents, with, frequent, success, a, very, fit, active, man, throughout, life, in, the, most, stressful, times, he, continued, to, enjoy, wrestling, as, a, form, of, relaxation, and, valued, friendships, which, afforded, opportunities, to, share, athletic, pursuits, he, could, be, abrasive, demanding, and, inconsiderate, of, those, around, him, but, frequently, made, up, for, it, with, gestures, such, as, confectionery, and, other, small, gifts, unlike, some, of, his, political, opponents, he, had, many, close, personal, friendships, within, the, movement, it, has, been, justly, said, that, while, some, were, devoted, to, the, idea, of, ireland, collins, was, a, people, person, whose, patriotism, was, rooted, in, affection, and, respect, for, the, people, of, ireland, around, him, among, his, famous, last, words, is, the, final, entry, in, his, pocket, diary, written, on, the, journey, that, ended, his, life, the, people, are, splendid, in, 1921, 22, he, became, engaged, to, kitty, kiernan, under, kiernan, s, influence, he, would, resume, catholic, religious, practice, though, retaining, secularism, as, a, political, position, despite, his, previous, hostility, to, the, irish, catholic, hierarchy, he, made, a, general, confession, before, his, departure, for, london, to, negotiate, the, anglo, irish, treaty, while, in, london, his, practice, of, lighting, votive, candles, for, kiernan, developed, a, habit, of, attending, mass, daily, usually, at, the, brompton, oratory, in, letters, between, the, two, he, credits, kiernan, as, having, given, him, a, newfound, appreciation, of, confession, and, communion, collins, attended, mass, regularly, throughout, the, ensuing, civil, war, collins, was, a, complex, man, whose, character, abounded, in, contradictions, he, seems, never, to, have, pursued, personal, profit, this, characteristic, was, exemplified, by, a, letter, he, wrote, on, 4, august, 1922, to, his, canvassing, agent, offering, to, pay, half, the, bill, for, a, hired, election, car, because, some, of, the, journeys, had, been, for, personal, trips, while, clearly, fond, of, command, and, keen, to, take, charge, he, had, an, equal, appetite, for, input, and, advice, from, people, at, every, level, of, the, organisation, prompting, the, comment, that, he, took, advice, from, his, chauffeur, although, acknowledged, by, friends, and, foes, as, head, centre, of, the, movement, he, continually, chose, a, title, just, short, of, actual, head, of, state, becoming, chairman, of, the, provisional, government, only, after, the, abdication, of, half, the, d, il, forced, him, to, do, so, while, his, official, and, personal, correspondence, records, his, solicitous, care, for, the, wants, of, insurgents, in, need, during, the, war, he, showed, no, hesitation, in, ordering, the, death, of, opponents, who, threatened, nationalist, lives, while, mastermind, of, a, clandestine, military, he, remained, a, public, figure, when, official, head, of, the, free, state, government, he, continued, to, cooperate, in, the, ira, s, secret, operations, he, was, capable, of, bold, decisive, actions, on, his, own, authority, which, caused, friction, with, his, colleagues, such, as, his, falling, out, with, cathal, brugha, but, at, critical, junctures, he, could, also, bow, to, majority, decisions, which, were, profoundly, disadvantageous, and, dangerous, to, his, own, interests, such, as, his, appointment, to, the, treaty, negotiating, team, an, annual, commemoration, ceremony, takes, place, each, year, in, august, at, the, ambush, site, at, b, al, na, bl, th, county, cork, organised, by, the, b, al, na, mbl, th, commemoration, committee, in, 2009, the, former, president, of, ireland, mary, robinson, gave, the,

audiovisuals, and, historical, artefacts, the, central, bank, of, ireland, released, gold, and, silver, commemorative, coins, on, 15, august, 2012, which, feature, a, portrait, of, michael, collins, designed, by, thomas, ryan, based, on, a, photograph, taken, not, long, before, his, death, collins, bequeathed, to, posterity, a, considerable, body, of, writing, essays, speeches, and, tracts, articles, and, official, documents, in, which, he, outlined, plans, for, ireland, s, economic, and, cultural, revival, as, well, as, a, voluminous, correspondence, both, official, and, personal, selections, have, been, published, in, the, path, to, freedom, mercier, 1968, and, in, michael, collins, in, his, own, words, gill, macmillan, 1997, in, the, 1960s, taoiseach, se, n, lemass, himself, a, veteran, of, the, 1916, rising, and, war, of, independence, credited, collins, ideas, as, the, basis, for, his, successes, in, revitalizing, ireland, s, economy, nine, years, after, his, death, the, uk, parliament, passed, the, statute, of, westminster, which, removed, virtually, all, of, london, s, remaining, authority, over, the, free, state, and, the, other, dominions, this, had, the, effect, of, granting, the, free, state, internationally, recognised, independence, thus, fulfilling, collins, vision, of, having, the, freedom, to, achieve, freedom, collins, and, the, ira, were, a, major, source, of, inspiration, for, the, leader, of, the, zionist, insurgent, lehi, group, and, future, prime, minister, of, israel, yitzhak, shamir, during, the, 1948, palestine, war, shamir,
