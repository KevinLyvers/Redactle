architecture, in, rome, vasari, worked, with, giacomo, barozzi, da, vignola, and, bartolomeo, ammannati, at, pope, julius, iii, s, villa, giulia, often, called, the, first, art, historian, vasari, invented, the, genre, of, the, encyclopedia, of, artistic, biographies, with, his, le, vite, de, pi, eccellenti, pittori, scultori, ed, architettori, lives, of, the, most, excellent, painters, sculptors, and, architects, this, work, was, first, published, in, 1550, and, dedicated, to, grand, duke, cosimo, i, de, medici, vasari, introduced, the, term, rinascita, rebirth, in, italian, in, printed, works, although, an, awareness, of, an, ongoing, rebirth, in, the, arts, had, been, in, the, air, since, the, time, of, alberti, vasari, s, term, applied, to, the, change, in, artistic, styles, with, the, work, of, giotto, eventually, would, become, the, french, term, renaissance, rebirth, widely, applied, to, the, era, that, followed, vasari, was, responsible, for, the, modern, use, of, the, term, gothic, art, as, well, although, he, only, used, the, word, goth, in, association, with, the, german, style, that, preceded, the, rebirth, which, he, identified, as, barbaric, the, lives, also, included, a, novel, treatise, on, the, technical, methods, employed, in, the, arts, the, book, was, partly, rewritten, and, extended, in, 1568, with, the, addition, of, woodcut, portraits, of, artists, some, conjectural, the, work, shows, a, consistent, and, notorious, bias, in, favour, of, florentines, and, tends, to, attribute, to, them, all, the, developments, in, renaissance, art, for, example, the, invention, of, engraving, venetian, art, in, particular, along, with, arts, from, other, parts, of, europe, is, ignored, systematically, in, the, first, edition, between, his, first, and, second, editions, vasari, visited, venice, and, while, the, second, edition, gave, more, attention, to, venetian, art, finally, including, titian, it, did, so, without, achieving, a, neutral, point, of, view, many, inaccuracies, exist, within, his, lives, for, example, vasari, writes, that, andrea, del, castagno, killed, domenico, veneziano, which, is, incorrect, andrea, died, several, years, before, domenico, in, another, example, vasari, s, biography, of, giovanni, antonio, bazzi, whom, he, calls, il, sodoma, published, only, in, the, second, edition, of, the, lives, 1568, after, bazzi, s, death, condemns, the, artist, as, being, immoral, bestial, and, vain, vasari, dismisses, bazzi, s, work, as, lazy, and, offensive, despite, the, artist, s, having, been, named, a, cavalier, of, the, supreme, order, of, christ, by, pope, leo, x, and, having, received, important, commissions, for, the, villa, farnese, and, other, sites, vasari, s, biographies, are, interspersed, with, amusing, gossip, many, of, his, anecdotes, seem, plausible, while, others, are, assumed, fictions, such, as, the, tale, of, young, giotto, painting, a, fly, on, the, surface, of, a, painting, by, cimabue, that, supposedly, the, older, master, repeatedly, tried, to, brush, away, a, genre, tale, that, echoes, anecdotes, told, of, the, greek, painter, apelles, he, did, carry, out, research, archives, for, exact, dates, as, modern, art, historians, do, and, his, biographies, are, considered, more, reliable, in, the, case, of, his, contemporary, painters, and, those, of, the, preceding, generation, modern, criticism, with, new, materials, produced, by, research, has, revised, many, of, his, dates, and, facts, vasari, included, a, short, autobiography, at, the, end, of, the, lives, and, added, further, details, about, himself, and, his, family, in, his, lives, of, lazzaro, vasari, and, francesco, salviati, according, to, the, historian, richard, goldthwaite, vasari, was, one, of, the, earliest, authors, to, use, the, term, competition, or, concorrenza, in, italian, in, its, economic, sense, he, used, it, repeatedly, and, stressed, the, concept, in, his, introduction, to, the, life, of, pietro, perugino, in, explaining, the, reasons, for, florentine, artistic, preeminence, in, vasari, s, view, florentine, artists, excelled, because, they, were, hungry, and, they, were, hungry, because, their, fierce, competition, amongst, themselves, for, commissions, kept, them, so, competition, he, said, is, one, of, the, nourishments, that, maintain, them, references, sources, copies, of, vasari, s, lives, of, the, artists, online
