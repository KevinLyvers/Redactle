ieyasu, as, he, was, a, member, of, the, matsudaira, clan, he, claimed, descent, from, the, seiwa, genji, branch, of, the, minamoto, clan, however, as, there, is, no, proof, that, the, matsudaira, clan, were, descendants, of, emperor, seiwa, the, emperor, initially, did, not, approve, the, appointment, citing, the, lack, of, a, precedent, for, the, serada, clan, of, the, seiwa, genji, clan, being, appointed, as, mikawa, no, kami, ieyasu, then, consulted, with, imperial, noble, konoe, motohisa, through, mediation, of, a, mikawa, native, and, abbot, of, kyo, seiganji, temple, due, to, motohisa, s, efforts, yoshida, kaneyoshi, discovered, a, genealogical, document, in, the, manri, koji, family, that, was, a, precedent, saying, tokugawa, belongs, to, minamoto, clan, as, another,

cooperation, with, the, takeda, but, ieyasu, rejected, the, idea, and, ieyasu, is, considered, to, have, been, in, a, position, of, independence, from, nobunaga, to, a, certain, extent, however, until, around, april, of, the, first, year, of, the, genki, era, diplomatic, negotiations, were, being, conducted, between, sakakibara, yasumasa, and, tsuchiya, masatsugu, who, acted, as,

asakura, forces, furthermore, as, ieyasu, s, army, was, now, free, to, move, they, exploited, the, gap, between, asakura, and, azai, forces, while, sending, tadakatsu, and, yasumasa, to, attack, the, flank, of, azai, s, army, formation, causing, the, battle, to, be, won, by, oda, tokugawa, forces, in, october, 1571, takeda, shingen, broke, the, alliance, with, the, oda, tokugawa, forces, and,

takeda, shingen, s, first, objective, in, his, campaign, against, ieyasu, was, nishikawa, castle, yoshida, castle, and, futamata, castle, in, 1572, after, besieging, futamata, shingen, would, press, on, past, futamata, towards, the, major, tokugawa, home, castle, at, hamamatsu, later, ieyasu, asked, for, help, from, nobunaga, who, sent, him, some, 3, 000, troops, early, in, 1573, the, two, armies, met, at, the, battle, of, mikatagahara, north, hamamatsu, the, considerably, larger, takeda, army, under, the, expert, direction, of, shingen, overwhelmed, ieyasu, s, troops, and, caused, heavy, casualties, despite, his, initial, reluctance, ieyasu, was, convinced, by, his, generals, to, retreat, the, battle, was, a, major, defeat, but, in, the, interests, of, maintaining, the, appearance, of, dignified, withdrawal, ieyasu, brazenly, ordered, the, men, at, his, castle, to, light, torches, sound, drums, and, leave, the, gates, open, to, properly, receive, the, returning, warriors, to, the, surprise, and, relief, of, the, tokugawa, army, this, spectacle, made, the, takeda, generals, suspicious, of, being, led, into, a, trap, so, they, did, not, besiege, the, castle, and, instead, made, camp, for, the, night, this, error, would, allow, a, band, of, tokugawa, soldiers, to, raid, the, camp, in, the, ensuing, hours, further, upsetting, the, already, disoriented, takeda, army, and, ultimately, resulting, in, shingen, s, decision, to, call, off, the, offensive, altogether, takeda, shingen, would, not, get, another, chance, to, advance, on, hamamatsu, much, less, kyoto, since, he, died, from, unknown, cause, shortly, after, the, siege, of, noda, castle, later, that, same, year, 153, 156, in, 1574, as, shingen, was, succeeded, by, his, son, takeda,

point, ieyasu, tried, to, capture, inui, castle, in, t, t, mi, province, however, strong, resistance, from, its, garrison, commander, amano, kagehira, forced, ieyasu, to, abort, the, siege, during, their, retreat, kagehira, launched, a, counterattack, to, pursue, ieyasu, which, was, repelled, by, mizuno, tadashige, and, torii, mototada, who, led, the, rearguard, in, 1575, on, april, ga, yashir,

katsuyori, of, kai, to, seize, okazaki, castle, however, one, of, yashiro, s, colleague, yamada, hachiz, betrayed, yashiro, and, passed, on, information, about, the, rebellion, to, nobuyasu, meanwhile, ieyasu, himself, also, learned, further, crime, of, yashir, of, corruptions, in, governance, through, one, of, his, vassal, s, report, on, june, during, takeda, katsuyori, s, raid, through, mikawa, province, he, attacked, yoshida, castle, and, besieged, nagashino, castle, ieyasu, appealed, to, nobunaga, for, help, and, nobunaga, came, personally, with, 30, 000, strong, men, the, oda, tokugawa, forces, of, 38, 000, won, a, great, victory, and, successfully, defended, nagashino, castle, though, the, takeda, forces, had, been, destroyed, katsuyori, survived, the, battle, and, retreated, back, to, kai, province, for, the, next, seven, years, ieyasu, and, katsuyori, fought, a, series, of, small, battles, as, the, result, of, which, ieyasu, s, troops, managed, to, wrestle, control, of, suruga, province, away, from, the, takeda, clan, in, 1579, lady, tsukiyama, ieyasu, s, wife, and, his, heir, nobuyasu, were, accused, by, nobunaga, of, conspiring, with, takeda, katsuyori, to, assassinate, nobunaga, whose, daughter, tokuhime, was, married, to, nobuyasu, for, this, reason, ieyasu, ordered, his, wife, to, be, executed, and, forced, his, son, to, commit, seppuku, there, are, various, theories, regarding, this, incident, according, to, the, mikawa, monogatari, which, was, written, by, kubo, tadachika, tokuhime, wife, of, nobuyasu, who, was, not, on, good, terms, with, her, mother, in, law, tsukiyama, dono, wrote, in, a, letter, to, her, father, nobunaga, that, her, mother, in, law, and, her, husband, were, secretly, conspiring, with, takeda, katsuyori, however, this, hypothesis, was, considered, obsolete, by, various, historians, in, the, modern, era, according, to, katsuhiro, taniguchi, the, more, plausible, theory, was, there, was, friction, within, the, house, of, tokugawa, clan, between, two, factions, with, conflicting, ideals, as, proposed, by, the, japanese, writer, tenkyu, goro, one, faction, was, active, on, the, front, lines, and, had, many, opportunities, to, advance, their, careers, dubbed, the, hamamatsu, castle, faction, the, other, faction, was, the, okazaki, castle, faction, which, consisted, of, tokugawa, vassals, responsible, for, logistical, support, due, to, past, injuries, and, other, factors, that, caused, them, to, play, a, lesser, role, in, the, current, politics, of, tokugawa, clan, according, to, this, theory, the, conflict, between, these, two, factions, eventually, led, to, a, conflict, between, ieyasu, and, his, son, nobuyasu, who, represented, the, okazaki, faction, finally, ending, with, nobuyasu, s, death, in, prison, nobuyasu, planned, to, exile, ieyasu, with, the, help, of, the, okazaki, castle, faction, before, and, after, his, son, s, execution, ieyasu, punished, or, executed, many, of, those, who, worked, at, okazaki, castle, and, some, escaped, from, the, castle, taniguchi, theorized, that, tsukiyama, also, participated, in, the, coup, d, tat, that, was, going, on, in, okazaki, castle, furthermore, sakai, tadatsugu, the, most, prominent, general, of, ieyasu, also, may, have, played, a, role, in, confirming, oda, nobunaga, s, suspicion, of, the, alleged, betrayal, against, the, oda, clan, being, planned, by, nobuyasu, tsukiyama, nobunaga, thus, may, have, concluded, that, if, a, high, ranking, fudai, daimy, such, as, tadatsugu, confirmed, the, accusation, against, lady, tsukiyama, then, her, treason, must, be, true, it, was, said, in, another, theory, that, tadatsugu, was, actually, conspiring, with, the, mother, of, ieyasu, odai, no, kata, to, get, rid, of, lady, tsukiyama, arthur, lindsay, sadler, theorized, this, was, a, deliberate, act, of, spite, from, tadatsugu, due, to, many, senior, tokugawa, clan, generals, dislike, of, nobuyasu, in, the, same, year, ieyasu, named, his, third, son, tokugawa, hidetada, as, his, heir, since, his, second, son, had, been, adopted, by, toyotomi, hideyoshi, who, would, later, become, an, extremely, powerful, daimyo, in, 1580, ieyasu, built, up, around, five, fortresses, in, order, to, isolate, the, takatenjin, castle, from, external, supplies, and, reinforcements, in, addition, of, those, 5, new, fortresses, ieyasu, renovated, an, old, castle, named, ogasayama, fort, which, originally, built, by, ieyasu, far, before, the, conquest, of, t, t, mi, province, against, imagawa, clan, to, capture, kakegawa, castle, as, these, six, fortresses, completed, ieyasu, assigned, ishikawa, yasumichi, to, garrison, the, ogasayama, fort, honda, yasushige, to, garrison, the, nogasaka, fort, osuga, yasutaka, to, garrison, the, higamine, fort, shishigahana, fort, and, nakamura, fort, while, sakai, ietada, was, appointed, to, garrison, the, mitsuiyama, fort, with, the, completion, of, those, cluster, of, castles, which, were, referred, as, six, fortresses, of, takatenjin, the, takatenjin, castle, which, was, defended, by, okabe, motonobu, immediately, suffered, a, period, of, starvation, as, they, were, deprived, of, any, sources, or, supplies, to, sustain, the, population, inside, the, castle, while, the, siege, outside, the, castle, by, oda, tokugawa, forces, intensified, in, response, motonobu, tried, to, negotiate, truce, with, ieyasu, by, offering, takisakai, castle, and, koyama, castle, to, be, given, for, ieyasu, in, exchange, that, takatenjin, castle, be, spared, from, the, siege, however, after, ieyasu, consulted, this, matter, to, nobunaga, he, refused, motonobu, s, plea, as, nobunaga, stated, his, reason, in, a, letter, that, if, takeda, katsuyori, sent, his, forces, to, assist, motonobu, then, there, would, be, an, opportunity, to, bait, takeda, clan, s, army, out, and, annihilate, them, on, the, field, meanwhile, nobunaga, also, stated, a, further, reason, that, if, katsuyori, neglected, motonobu, from, any, help, it, would, damage, the, takeda, clan, s, credibility, as, they, could, not, save, their, own, vassals, in, 1581, ieyasu, forces, managed, to, subdue, tanaka, castle, and, recapture, takatenjin, castle, where, okabe, motonobu, was, killed, during, the, fight, the, end, of, the, war, with, takeda, katsuyori, came, in, 1582, when, a, combined, oda, tokugawa, force, attacked, and, conquered, kai, province, where, katsuyori, was, cornered, and, defeated, at, the, battle, of, tenmokuzan, and, then, committed, seppuku, then, as, the, takeda, clan, practically, annihilated, as, political, entity, nobunaga, gave, ieyasu, the, right, to, govern, suruga, province, in, recognition, of, his, service, to, fight, the, takeda, clan, in, late, june, 1582, before, the, incident, at, honn, ji, temple, oda, nobunaga, invited, ieyasu, to, tour, the, kansai, region, in, celebration, of, the, demise, of, the, takeda, clan, when, he, learned, that, nobunaga, had, been, killed, at, the, honn, ji, temple, by, akechi, mitsuhide, tokugawa, ieyasu, heard, the, news, in, hirakata, osaka, but, at, the, time, he, had, only, few, companions, with, him, the, iga, province, track, were, also, in, danger, of, the, ochimusha, gari, or, samurai, hunters, gang, ieyasu, and, his, party, therefore, chose, the, shortest, route, back, to, the, mikawa, province, by, crossing, the, iga, province, which, was, differed, in, many, versions, according, to, primary, sources, such, as, the, records, of, tokugawa, nikki, or,

kyoto, after, such, a, gesture, it, would, give, hideyoshi, a, just, cause, for, war, ieyasu, finally, decided, to, become, hideyoshi, s, vassal, in, 1590, may, ieyasu, participated, in, the, campaign, against, the, h, j, clan, the, siege, of, odawara, as, the, last, h, j, clan, stronghold, almost, saw, no, significant, military, action, with, the, exception, of, ii, naomasa, night, raid,

a, senior, h, j, clan, retainer, was, also, forced, to, commit, seppuku, by, hideyoshi, however, his, children, were, spared, from, execution, at, the, behest, of, ieyasu, and, his, eldest, son, daid, ji, naoshige, became, a, vassal, of, ieyasu, after, the, death, of, ujinao, until, his, death, in, edo, period, later, in, october, 28, of, the, same, year, a, massive, rebellion, against, the, toyotomi, government, in, mutsu, province, which, incited, by, hienuki, hirotada, and, waga, yoshitada, broke, out, in, response, hideyoshi, sent, a, punitive, expedition, with, 30, 000, army, in, strength, led, by, ieyasu, tokugawa, toyotomi, hidetsugu, date, masamune, ishida, mitsunari, tani, yoshitsugu, gam, ujisato, uesugi, kagekatsu, satake, yoshishige, and, maeda, toshiie, in, order, to, pacify, those, rebellions, in, 1591, ieyasu, gave, up, control, of, his, five, provinces, mikawa, t, t, mi, suruga, shinano, and, kai, and, moved, all, his, soldiers, and, vassals, to, his, new, eight, provinces, at, the, kant, region, the, proclamation, of, this, decision, were, happened, on, the, same, day, with, the, day, when, hideyoshi, entered, odawara, castle, after, the, h, j, clan, formally, surrendered, the, moment, ieyasu, appointed, to, rule, kant, he, immediately, assign, his, premier, vassals, such, as, ii, naomasa, honda, tadakatsu, sakakibara, yasumasa, and, sakai, ietsugu, son, of, sakai, tadatsugu, each, to, control, large, area, of, the, former, h, j, clan, territories, in, kant, historian, saw, this, step, were, aimed, to, bring, order, the, newly, subdued, population, of, the, area, while, also, guard, the, eastern, domains, from, any, influence, or, threat, from, the, satomi, clan, which, has, not, yet, submit, to, toyotomi, rule, at, that, time, meanwhile, ieyasu, himself, establish, his, personal, new, seat, of, power, on, edo, town, which, at, that, time, was, an, underdeveloped, town, in, kant, historian, adam, sadler, saw, this, step, as, the, riskiest, by, ieyasu, ever, made, to, leave, his, home, province, and, rely, on, the, uncertain, loyalty, of, the, formerly, h, j, clan, samurai, in, kant, in, the, end, however, it, worked, out, brilliantly, for, ieyasu, he, reformed, the, kant, region, controlled, and, pacified, the, h, j, samurai, and, improved, the, underlying, economic, infrastructure, of, the, lands, also, because, kant, was, somewhat, isolated, from, the, rest, of, japan, ieyasu, was, able, to, ally, with, daimyos, of, north, east, japan, such, as, date, masamune, mogami, yoshiaki, satake, yoshishige, and, nanbu, nobunao, he, was, also, able, to, maintain, a, unique, level, of, autonomy, from, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, rule, within, a, few, years, ieyasu, had, become, the, second, most, powerful, daimyo, in, japan, it, was, said, by, anecdotal, proverb, that, ieyasu, won, the, empire, by, retreating, however, modern, japanese, historians, rejected, this, step, as, inherently, deliberate, move, by, ieyasu, since, it, was, an, order, from, hideyoshi, nevertheless, watanabe, daimon, stated, that, the, general, opinion, usually, though, ieyasu, was, reluctant, about, his, transfer, to, kant, daimon, stated, the, perception, of, ieyasu, s, reluctance, were, unfounded, instead, daimon, suspected, that, ieyasu, actually, responded, this, transfer, positively, as, he, saw, huge, undeveloped, potential, by, making, edo, as, his, seat, of, power, similarly, and, y, ichir, also, viewed, this, transfer, were, rather, an, advantage, for, the, tokugawa, regime, in, the, long, run, as, this, move, was, not, only, doubled, the, territories, he, control, but, he, also, further, added, the, bulk, of, new, vassals, in, kant, to, the, already, impressive, political, and, military, power, of, tokugawa, regime, as, they, already, absorbed, the, army, of, imagawa, clan, and, takeda, clan, before, y, ichir, also, added, that, aside, from, the, samurai, clans, from, imagawa, takeda, and, h, j, the, mikawa, samurai, clans, which, was, tokugawa, clan, traditional, followers, also, lose, their, sense, of, independence, after, being, transferred, into, new, unfamiliar, territory, while, increasing, their, sense, of, dependence, towards, ieyasu, thus, in, effect, further, minimize, the, possibility, of, them, to, going, renegade, and, betraying, ieyasu, just, like, ishikawa, kazumasa, had, done, several, years, earlier, in, march, subsequent, with, waga, hienuki, rebellion, kunohe, rebellion, also, broke, out, in, march, 13, 1591, this, causing, the, punitive, expedition, army, to, take, measure, of, this, development, by, splitting, their, forces, as, ieyasu, naomasa, ujisato, and, some, commanders, were, now, changing, their, focus, to, suppress, masazane, s, rebellion, first, ieyasu, which, at, that, time, also, busy, in, suppressing, rebellions, with, his, main, commanders, such, as, sakakibara, yasumasa, ii, naomasa, and, honda, tadakatsu, arrived, at, iwatesawa, tamazukuri, district, mutsu, modern, day, iwadeyama, town, tamazukuri, miyagi, prefecture, on, august, 18, where, he, camped, until, october, and, led, the, troops, during, the, operation, against, the, kunohe, clan, rebels, naomasa, ii, became, the, vanguard, with, nanbu, nobunao, as, they, advanced, towards, kunohe, castle, they, faced, a, small, forces, of, kunohe, rebels, which, easily, defeated, as, they, approached, the, kunohe, castle, naomasa, suggested, to, the, other, commanders, to, besiege, the, kunohe, s, castle, until, they, surrender, which, met, with, agreement, from, them, on, 4, september, the, rebels, executed, the, prisoners, inside, the, castle, and, committing, mass, suicide, after, setting, fire, which, burned, the, castle, for, three, days, and, three, nights, and, killed, all, within, the, rebellions, finally, being, suppressed, june, 20, with, waga, yoshitada, being, slain, in, battle, while, hienuki, hirotada, sentenced, to, kaieki, law, which, stated, that, he, and, his, clan, s, status, and, rights, as, samurai, being, stripped, as, the, operation, ended, ieyasu, return, to, edo, on, october, 29, and, began, managing, his, new, territory, in, the, kant, region, in, the, end, ieyasu, manage, to, establish, his, home, base, in, kant, as, he, built, sustainable, economic, infrastructure, in, those, region, furthermore, to, streamline, the, tokugawa, clan, s, economy, ieyasu, also, employed, got, sh, zabur, head, of, the, gold, mining, and, metal, industries, of, sengoku, period, to, mint, gold, coins, and, establish, a, bank, like, institution, for, the, tokugawa, clan, s, government, in, 1592, toyotomi, hideyoshi, invaded, korea, as, a, prelude, to, his, plan, to, attack, china, the, tokugawa, clan, samurai, never, actually, took, part, in, this, campaign, as, hideyoshi, ordered, eastern, provinces, daimyo, such, as, ieyasu, uesugi, kagekatsu, and, date, masamune, to, maintain, logistical, supports, for, the, war, efforts, in, nagoya, castle, in, 1593, toyotomi, hideyoshi, fathered, a, son, and, heir, toyotomi, hideyori, later, though, in, early, 1593, ieyasu, himself, was, summoned, to, hideyoshi, s, court, in, nagoya, in, ky, sh, different, from, the, similarly, spelled, city, in, owari, province, as, a, military, advisor, and, given, command, of, a, body, of, troops, meant, as, reserves, for, the, korean, campaign, ieyasu, stayed, in, nagoya, off, and, on, for, the, next, five, years, in, july, 1595, the, toyotomi, hidetsugu, incident, occurred, in, response, to, this, major, incident, that, shook, the, toyotomi, government, hideyoshi, ordered, the, various, daimyo, to, come, to, kyoto, in, an, attempt, to, calm, the, situation, ieyasu, also, came, to, kyoto, on, hideyoshi, s, orders, from, this, point, on, ieyasu, spent, longer, periods, in, fushimi, castle, than, in, his, underdeveloped, residence, edo, castle, due, to, this, chain, of, events, ieyasu, s, position, in, the, toyotomi, government, had, risen, but, by, being, at, the, center, of, the, government, ieyasu, himself, was, able, to, learn, directly, about, the, political, system, of, the, central, government, in, 1598, with, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, health, clearly, failing, hideyoshi, called, a, meeting, that, would, determine, the, council, of, five, elders, who, would, be, responsible, for, ruling, on, behalf, of, his, son, after, his, death, the, five, that, were, chosen, as, tair, regent, for, hideyori, were, maeda, toshiie, m, ri, terumoto, ukita, hideie, uesugi, kagekatsu, and, ieyasu, himself, who, was, the, most, powerful, of, the, five, this, change, in, the, pre, sekigahara, power, structure, became, pivotal, as, ieyasu, turned, his, attention, towards, kansai, and, at, the, same, time, other, ambitious, albeit, ultimately, unrealized, plans, such, as, the, tokugawa, initiative, establishing, official, relations, with, new, spain, modern, day, mexico, continued, to, unfold, and, advance, toyotomi, hideyoshi, after, three, more, months, of, increasing, sickness, died, on, september, 18, 1598, he, was, nominally, succeeded, by, his, young, son, hideyori, but, as, he, was, just, five, years, old, real, power, was, in, the, hands, of, the, regents, there, are, several, incidents, involving, ieyasu, after, the, death, of, hideyoshi, meanwhile, opposition, to, ieyasu, centered, around, ishida, mitsunari, one, of, hideyoshi, s, go, bugy, or, top, administrators, of, hideyoshi, s, government, and, a, powerful, daimyo, who, was, not, one, of, the, regents, mitsunari, plotted, ieyasu, s, death, and, news, of, this, plot, reached, some, of, ieyasu, s, generals, they, attempted, to, kill, mitsunari, but, he, fled, and, gained, protection, from, none, other, than, ieyasu, himself, it, is, not, clear, why, ieyasu, protected, a, powerful, enemy, from, his, own, men, but, ieyasu, was, a, master, strategist, and, he, may, have, concluded, that, he, would, be, better, off, with, mitsunari, leading, the, enemy, army, rather, than, one, of, the, regents, who, would, have, more, legitimacy, nearly, all, of, japan, s, daimyo, and, samurai, now, split, into, two, factions, the, western, army, mitsunari, s, group, and, the, eastern, army, ieyasu, s, group, ieyasu, supported, the, anti, mitsunari, group, and, formed, them, as, his, potential, allies, ieyasu, s, allies, were, kat, kiyomasa, fukushima, masanori, mogami, yoshiaki, hachisuka, iemasa, the, kuroda, clan, the, hosokawa, clan, and, many, daimyo, from, eastern, japan, mitsunari, allied, himself, with, the, three, other, regents, ukita, hideie, m, ri, terumoto, and, uesugi, kagekatsu, as, well, as, with, tani, yoshitsugu, chosokabe, clan, shimazu, clan, and, many, daimyo, from, the, western, end, of, honsh, war, became, imminent, when, uesugi, kagekatsu, one, of, hideyoshi, s, appointed, regents, defied, ieyasu, by, building, up, his, military, at, aizu, when, ieyasu, officially, condemned, him, and, demanded, that, he, come, to, kyoto, to, explain, himself, kagekatsu, s, chief, advisor, naoe, kanetsugu, responded, with, a, counter, condemnation, that, mocked, ieyasu, s, abuses, and, violations, of, hideyoshi, s, rules, and, ieyasu, was, infuriated, in, july, 1600, ieyasu, was, back, in, edo, and, his, allies, moved, their, armies, to, defeat, the, uesugi, clan, which, they, accused, of, planning, to, revolt, against, toyotomi, administration, on, september, 8, ieyasu, received, information, that, mitsunari, had, captured, fushimi, castle, and, his, allies, had, moved, their, army, against, ieyasu, ieyasu, held, a, meeting, with, the, eastern, army, daimyo, and, they, agreed, to, follow, ieyasu, later, on, september, 15, mitsunari, s, western, army, arrived, at, ogaki, castle, on, september, 29, ieyasu, s, eastern, army, took, gifu, castle, on, october, 7, ieyasu, and, his, allies, marched, along, the, t, kaid, while, his, son, hidetada, went, along, through, nakasend, with, 38, 000, soldiers, a, battle, against, sanada, masayuki, in, shinano, province, delayed, hidetada, s, forces, and, they, did, not, arrive, in, time, for, the, main, battle, of, sekigahara, the, battle, of, sekigahara, was, the, biggest, as, well, as, one, of, the, most, important, battles, in, japanese, feudal, history, it, began, on, october, 21, 1600, the, eastern, army, led, by, tokugawa, ieyasu, initially, numbered, 75, 000, men, with, the, western, army, at, a, strength, of, 120, 000, men, under, ishida, mitsunari, ieyasu, had, also, secretly, acquired, a, supply, of, arquebuses, knowing, that, the, tokugawa, forces, were, heading, towards, osaka, mitsunari, decided, to, abandon, his, positions, and, marched, to, sekigahara, even, though, the, western, army, had, tremendous, tactical, advantages, ieyasu, had, already, been, in, contact, with, many, of, the, daimyo, in, the, western, army, for, months, promising, them, land, and, leniency, after, the, battle, should, they, switch, sides, ieyasu, had, also, secretly, communicated, with, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, nephew, kobayakawa, hideaki, with, a, total, of, 170, 000, soldiers, facing, each, other, the, battle, of, sekigahara, ensued, and, ended, with, an, overwhelming, tokugawa, victory, at, the, conclusion, of, the, battle, ieyasu, marched, to, osaka, castle, where, m, ri, terumoto, the, grand, commander, of, western, army, surrendered, to, him, the, western, bloc, quickly, collapsed, and, over, the, next, few, days, ishida, mitsunari, and, other, western, leaders, such, as, konishi, yukinaga, and, ankokuji, ekei, were, captured, and, executed, however, ieyasu, was, angry, at, his, son, hidetada, whose, army, was, late, to, arrive, leading, to, an, unexpectedly, long, siege, against, ueda, castle, however, sakakibara, yasumasa, offered, an, explanation, and, testified, in, defense, of, hidetada, meanwhile, ieyasu, pardoned, his, enemies, who, defended, the, ueda, castle, sanada, masayuki, and, sanada, yukimura, at, the, behest, of, ii, naomasa, and, sanada, nobuyuki, ieyasu, also, redistribute, the, domain, fiefs, all, daimyo, lords, who, supported, him, during, the, war, such, as, the, increase, of, ii, naomasa, into, 180, 000, koku, ikeda, terumasa, into, 520, 000, koku, t, d, takatora, for, new, domain, which, assessed, at, total, of, 200, 000, koku, yuki, hideyasu, from, 101, 000, to, 569, 000, koku, matsudaira, tadayoshi, from, 100, 000, to, 520, 000, koku, gam, hideyuki, from, 180, 000, to, 600, 000, koku, maeda, toshinaga, from, 835, 000, to, 1, 100, 000, koku, kat, kiyomasa, from, 195, 000, to, 515, 000, koku, and, kuroda, nagamasa, from, 180, 000, to, 523, 000, koku, meanwhile, fukushima, masanori, had, his, 200, 000, increased, to, 498, 000, in, aki, hiroshima, while, ieyasu, also, promoted, many, of, his, own, hereditary, vassals, to, at, least, 10, 000, koku, increase, for, their, stipends, meanwhile, regarding, the, losers, of, sekigahara, war, ieyasu, left, some, western, daimyo, unharmed, such, as, the, shimazu, clan, but, others, were, completely, destroyed, toyotomi, hideyori, the, son, of, hideyoshi, lost, most, of, his, territory, which, were, under, management, of, western, daimyo, and, he, was, degraded, to, an, ordinary, daimyo, not, a, sessh, and, kampaku, regent, of, japan, empire, in, later, years, the, vassals, who, had, pledged, allegiance, to, ieyasu, before, sekigahara, became, known, as, the, fudai, daimy, while, those, who, pledged, allegiance, to, him, after, the, battle, in, other, words, after, his, power, was, unquestioned, were, known, as, tozama, daimy, tozama, daimy, were, considered, inferior, to, fudai, daimy, this, redistributions, of, domains, was, done, verbally, not, by, formal, letter, of, intent, as, historian, watanabe, daimon, suspected, this, was, because, ieyasu, still, wary, with, the, existence, of, toyotomi, clan, which, now, inherited, by, toyotomi, hideyori, on, september, 20, ieyasu, entered, otsu, castle, where, he, welcomed, and, met, with, ky, nyo, current, head, of, hongan, ji, temple, at, that, time, with, the, intermediary, of, kanamori, nagachika, he, met, ieyasu, again, the, following, year, 1601, and, ieyasu, visited, kyonyo, on, july, 5, and, august, 16, however, for, the, rest, of, 1601, the, relationship, between, the, grew, worse, as, ky, nyo, were, accused, of, pro, mitsunari, sympathy, it, was, only, in, february, 1602, the, communication, between, ieyasu, with, ky, nyo, opened, again, after, the, intercession, from, aide, honda, masanobu, where, the, three, of, them, discussed, about, the, condition, of, honganji, temple, development, after, the, split, of, the, sect, into, two, factions, since, ieyasu, worried, the, strife, within, the, temple, could, affect, the, stability, of, japan, post, sekigahara, war, in, 1602, ieyasu, changed, his, original, surname, from, minamoto, to, fujiwara, the, reason, for, this, name, changing, was, because, the, emperor, go, y, zei, wanted, to, appoint, ieyasu, as, a, court, noble, however, but, there, was, no, precedent, in, the, tokugawa, bloodline, as, minamoto, clan, which, ieyasu, ancestry, claimed, was, a, samurai, clan, to, resolve, this, problem, a, fabrication, made, that, the, tokugawa, clan, also, descended, from, fujiwara, clan, too, which, is, a, noble, family, by, this, name, changing, to, fujiwara, ieyasu, was, able, to, be, appointed, to, the, rank, of, junior, fifth, rank, on, march, 24, 1603, tokugawa, ieyasu, received, the, title, of, sh, gun, from, emperor, go, y, zei, ieyasu, was, 60, years, old, he, had, outlasted, all, the, other, great, men, of, his, times, oda, nobunaga, takeda, shingen, toyotomi, hideyoshi, and, uesugi, kenshin, as, sh, gun, he, used, his, remaining, years, to, create, and, solidify, the, tokugawa, shogunate, which, ushered, in, the, edo, period, and, was, the, third, shogunal, government, after, the, kamakura, and, the, ashikaga, he, claimed, descent, from, the, minamoto, clan, who, had, founded, the, kamakura, shogunate, by, way, of, the, nitta, clan, his, descendants, would, marry, into, the, taira, clan, and, the, fujiwara, clan, following, a, well, established, japanese, pattern, ieyasu, abdicated, his, official, position, as, sh, gun, in, 1605, his, successor, was, his, son, and, heir, tokugawa, hidetada, there, may, have, been, several, factors, that, contributed, to, his, decision, including, his, desires, to, avoid, being, tied, up, in, ceremonial, duties, to, make, it, harder, for, his, enemies, to, attack, the, real, power, center, and, to, secure, a, smoother, succession, of, his, son, in, 1604, t, d, takatora, and, date, masamune, advised, the, shogunate, government, to, introduce, a, rule, across, japan, that, each, feudal, lord, were, obliged, to, maintain, residence, in, edo, capital, of, shogunate, which, immediately, accepted, and, implemented, officially, from, 1605, onwards, ieyasu, retired, from, official, position, as, shogun, and, now, become, a, retired, sh, gun, gosho, remained, the, effective, ruler, of, japan, until, his, death, ieyasu, retired, to, sunpu, castle, in, sunpu, but, he, also, supervised, the, building, of, edo, castle, a, massive, construction, project, which, lasted, for, the, rest, of, ieyasu, s, life, the, result, was, the, largest, castle, in, all, of, japan, the, costs, for, building, the, castle, being, borne, by, all, the, other, daimyo, while, ieyasu, reaped, all, the, benefits, the, central, donjon, or, tenshu, burned, in, the, 1657, meireki, fire, today, the, imperial, palace, stands, on, the, site, of, the, castle, edo, became, the, center, of, political, power, and, the, de, facto, capital, of, japan, although, the, historic, capital, of, kyoto, remained, the, de, jure, capital, as, the, seat, of, the, emperor, furthermore, ieyasu, had, the, imperial, court, appoint, his, eldest, remaining, son, hidetada, as, shogun, announcing, to, the, world, that, the, position, of, shogun, would, be, hereditary, to, the, tokugawa, clan, from, then, on, at, the, same, time, he, requested, toyotomi, hideyori, to, meet, the, new, shogun, hidetada, but, hideyori, refused, in, the, end, the, matter, was, resolved, by, sending, his, sixth, son, matsudaira, tadateru, to, osaka, castle, at, the, same, time, the, next, generation, of, tokugawa, clan, vassals, such, ii, naotaka, and, itakura, shigemasa, were, also, appointed, in, 1608, ieyasu, has, takatora, assigned, the, control, of, tsu, it, was, reported, that, the, landholdings, which, takatora, received, in, iga, province, were, previously, belongs, to, a, lord, named, tsutsui, sadatsugu, which, ieyasu, stripped, off, and, give, the, rights, to, takatora, the, initial, pretext, were, because, sadatsugu, s, sloppy, governance, of, the, domain, however, historians, arguing, that, the, reason, were, because, sadatsugu, behaved, suspiciously, visiting, toyotomi, hideyori, at, osaka, castle, without, the, shogunate, approval, while, the, land, which, sadatsugu, occupied, was, considered, as, important, military, strategic, location, furthermore, it, was, more, though, that, in, ieyasu, perspective, to, strip, the, land, and, give, it, to, the, todo, clan, as, political, strategy, against, the, toyotomi, clan, as, despite, his, patronage, to, the, toyotomi, family, t, d, takatora, were, considered, as, a, close, ally, of, ieyasu, thus, by, making, him, to, control, the, portions, of, iga, province, it, could, pushed, more, strategic, locations, to, the, influence, of, shogunate, without, directly, provoking, the, toyotomi, faction, in, osaka, in, 1611, keicho, 16, ieyasu, at, the, head, of, 50, 000, men, visited, kyoto, to, witness, the, enthronement, of, emperor, go, mizunoo, in, kyoto, ieyasu, ordered, the, remodeling, of, the, imperial, court, and, buildings, and, forced, the, remaining, western, daimyo, to, sign, an, oath, of, fealty, to, him, furthermore, on, april, 12, ieyasu, presented, three, articles, of, legislation, to, the, daimyo, lords, in, kyoto, the, important, point, of, these, three, articles, was, that, they, referred, to, the, shogun, s, legal, code, since, minamoto, no, yoritomo, and, that, they, would, strictly, abide, by, the, laws, issued, by, the, shogunate, from, then, on, next, they, made, the, lords, swear, not, to, conceal, those, who, disobeyed, the, shogun, s, orders, and, not, to, hid, or, give, shelters, to, any, enemy, of, the, states, 22, daimyo, from, the, hokuriku, region, and, western, provinces, agreed, to, the, three, articles, of, legislation, and, submitted, an, oath, daimyo, lords, from, of, oshu, and, kanto, were, not, included, in, this, list, because, they, were, engaged, in, the, construction, of, edo, castle, and, did, not, come, to, kyoto, in, january, of, the, following, year, 11, major, feudal, lords, from, oshu, and, kanto, swore, to, the, three, laws, after, that, 50, small, and, medium, sized, fudai, and, tozama, feudal, lords, also, swore, to, the, three, laws, and, ieyasu, succeeded, in, making, all, the, feudal, lords, in, the, country, his, vassals, ieyasu, did, not, have, hideyori, work, on, national, construction, nor, did, he, have, him, swear, to, the, three, laws, however, watanabe, daimon, saw, this, three, law, articles, issued, by, ieyasu, was, a, maneuver, to, isolate, hideyori, politically, by, making, other, influential, daimyo, lords, obey, him, in, 1613, he, composed, the, kuge, shohatto, a, document, which, put, the, court, daimyo, under, strict, supervision, leaving, them, as, mere, ceremonial, figureheads, in, 1615, ieyasu, prepared, the, buke, shohatto, a, document, setting, out, the, future, of, the, tokugawa, regime, as, gosho, ieyasu, also, supervised, diplomatic, affairs, with, the, netherlands, spain, and, england, ieyasu, chose, to, distance, japan, from, european, influence, starting, in, 1609, although, the, shogunate, did, still, grant, preferential, trading, rights, to, the, dutch, east, india, company, and, permitted, them, to, maintain, a, factory, for, trading, purposes, from, 1605, until, his, death, ieyasu, frequently, consulted, english, shipwright, and, pilot, william, adams, adams, a, protestant, fluent, in, japanese, assisted, the, shogunate, in, negotiating, trading, relations, but, was, cited, by, members, of, the, competing, jesuit, and, spanish, sponsored, mendicant, orders, as, an, obstacle, to, improved, relations, between, ieyasu, and, the, roman, catholic, church, in, 1612, nossa, senhora, da, gra, a, incident, occurred, at, nagasaki, where, bugy, official, of, sakai, hasegawa, fujihiro, has, trouble, with, portuguese, captain, andr, pessoa, the, conflict, between, them, increased, as, pessoa, and, the, merchants, from, macau, petitioned, ieyasu, directly, to, complain, about, hasegawa, and, murayama, t, an, magistrate, of, ieyasu, as, the, jesuits, learned, of, this, affair, they, were, horrified, when, they, found, out, about, pessoa, s, petition, as, they, knew, that, hasegawa, s, sister, onatsu, was, a, favorite, concubine, of, ieyasu, later, pessoa, ceased, his, decision, as, he, learned, the, intrigue, of, shogunate, however, fujihiro, refused, to, forgive, pessoa, s, action, to, petition, him, fujihiro, encouraged, arima, harunobu, who, wanted, to, retaliate, for, the, prior, macau, incident, to, petition, ieyasu, for, the, capture, of, pessoa, and, the, seizure, of, a, merchant, ship, ieyasu, who, had, entrusted, harunobu, with, the, purchase, of, agarwood, was, initially, concerned, that, a, retaliatory, act, would, cut, off, trade, with, portuguese, ships, thus, the, shogunate, took, lenient, attitude, to, pessoa, as, honda, masazumi, with, authorization, from, ieyasu, gave, pessoa, s, envoy, written, assurances, that, japanese, sailors, would, be, forbidden, to, travel, to, macau, and, any, who, did, could, be, handled, according, to, portuguese, laws, however, later, ieyasu, gave, harunobu, permission, after, he, guaranteed, that, manila, ships, of, spanish, merchants, who, had, a, personal, alliance, with, portugal, would, replenish, the, raw, silk, and, other, goods, carried, by, portuguese, ships, and, he, also, expected, dutch, ships, to, continue, arriving, then, ultimately, ieyasu, gave, authorization, to, hasegawa, and, arima, harunobu, after, several, days, battle, which, resulted, in, death, of, pessoa, the, remaining, portuguese, merchants, and, missionaries, were, naturally, concerned, about, their, fates, especially, since, ieyasu, had, personally, ordered, their, execution, harunobu, as, a, catholic, daimyo, interceded, on, the, behalf, of, the, jesuits, ieyasu, changed, his, decision, and, eventually, the, merchants, were, allowed, to, leave, for, macau, with, their, properties, however, ieyasu, s, jesuit, translator, jo, o, rodrigues, t, uzu, was, replaced, by, william, adams, jo, o, rodrigues, then, was, expelled, from, japan, by, ieyasu, in, 1612, the, okamoto, daihachi, incident, occurred, where, okamoto, daihachi, baptismal, name, paulo, a, christian, aide, to, the, r, j, honda, masazumi, and, arima, harunobu, were, implicated, in, series, of, crimes, such, as, bribery, conspiracy, forgery, and, attempt, to, murder, hasegawa, fujihiro, ieyasu, angered, when, he, heard, that, catholic, followers, had, gathered, at, okamoto, s, execution, to, offer, prayers, and, sing, hymns, in, 1614, ieyasu, was, sufficiently, concerned, about, spanish, territorial, ambitions, that, he, signed, a, christian, expulsion, edict, the, edict, banned, the, practice, of, christianity, and, led, to, the, expulsion, of, all, foreign, missionaries, although, some, smaller, dutch, trading, operations, remained, in, nagasaki, the, last, remaining, threat, to, ieyasu, s, rule, was, toyotomi, hideyori, the, son, and, rightful, heir, to, hideyoshi, he, was, now, a, young, daimyo, living, in, osaka, castle, many, samurai, who, opposed, ieyasu, rallied, around, hideyori, claiming, that, he, was, the, rightful, ruler, of, japan, ieyasu, found, fault, with, the, opening, ceremony, of, a, temple, great, buddha, of, kyoto, built, by, hideyori, it, was, as, if, he, prayed, for, ieyasu, s, death, and, the, ruin, of, the, tokugawa, clan, ieyasu, ordered, hideyori, to, leave, osaka, castle, but, those, in, the, castle, refused, and, summoned, samurai, to, gather, within, the, castle, then, in, 1614, tokugawa, besieged, the, osaka, castle, against, hideyori, the, tokugawa, forces, with, a, huge, army, led, by, ieyasu, and, sh, gun, tokugawa, hidetada, laid, siege, to, osaka, castle, in, what, is, now, known, as, the, winter, siege, of, osaka, eventually, the, tokugawa, were, able, to, force, negotiations, and, an, armistice, after, directed, cannon, fire, threatened, hideyori, s, mother, yodo, dono, however, once, the, treaty, was, agreed, the, tokugawa, filled, the, castle, s, outer, moats, with, sand, so, his, troops, could, walk, across, through, this, ploy, the, tokugawa, gained, a, huge, tract, of, land, through, negotiation, and, deception, that, they, could, not, through, siege, and, combat, ieyasu, returned, to, sunpu, castle, but, after, toyotomi, hideyori, refused, another, order, to, leave, osaka, ieyasu, and, his, allied, army, of, 155, 000, soldiers, attacked, osaka, castle, again, in, the, summer, siege, of, osaka, finally, in, late, 1615, osaka, castle, fell, and, nearly, all, the, defenders, were, killed, including, hideyori, his, mother, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, widow, yodo, dono, and, his, infant, son, his, wife, senhime, a, granddaughter, of, ieyasu, pleaded, to, save, hideyori, and, yodo, dono, s, lives, ieyasu, refused, and, either, required, them, to, commit, ritual, suicide, or, killed, both, of, them, eventually, senhime, was, sent, back, to, the, tokugawa, alive, with, the, toyotomi, line, finally, extinguished, no, threats, remained, to, the, tokugawa, clan, s, domination, of, japan, after, the, conflict, with, toyotomi, hideyori, ieyasu, implemented, the, buke, shohatto, code, which, stated, that, each, daimyo, lord, only, allowed, to, possess, one, castle, in, 1616, tokugawa, ieyasu, died, at, age,

believe, that, after, the, first, anniversary, of, his, death, his, remains, were, reburied, at, nikk, shrine, nikk, t, sh, g, and, his, remains, are, still, there, neither, shrine, has, offered, to, open, the, graves, so, the, location, of, ieyasu, s, physical, remains, is, still, a, mystery, the, mausoleum, s, architectural, style, became, known, as, gongen, zukuri, that, is, gongen, style, he, was, first, given, the, buddhist, name, tosho, dai, gongen, then, after, his, death, it, was, changed, to, hogo, onkokuin, during, this, time, the, chief, physician, who, cared, for, him, sotetsu, katayama, diagnosed, ieyasu, with, stomach, cancer, however, ieyasu, misinterpret, katayama, s, diagnose, of, his, illness, as, a, mass, of, tapeworms, problem, thus, he, did, not, take, the, medicine, sotetsu, had, prepared, and, instead, continued, his, own, method, of, therapy, which, he, believed, could, cure, his, perceived, tapeworms, problem, this, resulted, in, ieyasu, s, health, became, more, deteriotated, although, his, son, hidetada, also, warned, him, about, his, medical, method, this, only, caused, to, anger, ieyasu, who, had, his, pride, as, a, person, who, possess, high, knowledge, in, medical, field, and, ended, instead, exiling, sotetsu, to, the, shinshu, takashima, domain, at, the, time, of, his, death, ieyasu, was, estimated, has, personal, wealth, of, about, 4, million, koku, and, reached, 8, million, koku, for, the, total, of, the, tokugawa, clan, owernership, he, also, possess, about, 42, ton, of, golds, as, the, tokugawa, shogunate, implemented, the, centralization, of, gold, and, silver, mines, ownership, unlike, the, previous, era, government, of, japan, which, possession, of, mines, ownership, were, managed, by, local, lords, through, the, shogunate, authorization, the, tokugawa, shogunate, would, rule, japan, for, the, next, 260, years, historical, evaluation, of, ieyasu, by, junji, mitsunari, from, the, history, faculty, of, kyushu, university, compares, ieyasu, s, upbringing, with, another, sengoku, era, leader, m, ri, terumoto, mitsunari, viewed, that, terumoto, who, has, been, raised, in, comfort, and, stable, domains, of, the, m, ri, clan, has, contrasted, with, the, hardships, of, ieyasu, during, his, childhood, who, experienced, the, unstable, region, in, mikawa, province, where, he, spend, much, his, youth, as, hostage, of, other, warlords, thus, forming, both, leader, s, character, into, different, styles, mitsunari, viewed, that, this, contrast, of, leadership, style, has, reflected, in, the, sekigahara, battle, where, the, indecisiveness, of, terumoto, costed, the, western, army, greatly, during, the, crucial, moment, while, ieyasu, s, bold, decision, and, his, willingness, to, take, the, risk, gave, him, the, edge, during, the, war, john, t, kuehn, saw, ieyasu, was, capable, of, complex, long, game, strategies, both, politically, and, militarily, as, he, shown, during, his, conflict, against, ishida, mitsunari, kuehn, saw, that, the, siege, of, fushimi, castle, was, ieyasu, s, deliberate, strategy, to, sacrifice, the, castle, and, baiting, mitsunari, into, set, piece, battle, where, his, more, battle, proven, forces, has, advantage, than, mitsunari, on, the, other, hand, kazuto, hong, has, compared, to, nobunaga, what, he, saw, as, the, tokugawa, had, instrument, to, ensure, the, stability, of, nation, which, was, his, optimization, of, the, abilities, of, his, vassals, rather, than, relying, on, the, power, of, individual, personality, and, established, succession, system, tetsuo, owada, personally, praise, of, how, ieyasu, manage, to, quickly, accepted, by, the, citizens, of, kant, region, and, ruled, there, without, unrests, after, he, transferred, there, by, continuing, the, lenient, tax, policies, of, the, h, j, clan, to, gain, sympathy, hamada, koichiro, from, himeji, dokkyo, university, university, has, recorded, that, there, is, systematic, attempt, of, historiography, studies, during, the, aftermath, of, meiji, restoration, to, portray, ieyasu, in, negative, reputation, as, cunning, old, man, who, used, the, temple, s, bell, of, hokoji, as, casus, belli, to, wage, war, against, hideyori, koichiro, saw, this, tendency, of, ieyasu, to, resort, into, underhanded, tactics, were, quite, justified, at, some, extend, for, different, reason, namely, was, how, his, attempt, in, suppressing, the, mikawa, ikk, ikki, rebellion, by, breaking, his, promise, of, leniency, for, j, do, shinsh, s, followers, in, exchange, for, surrender, however, koichiro, also, points, out, that, ieyasu, was, also, capable, of, bravery, as, he, showed, by, personally, entering, the, battlefield, during, the, rebellion, while, also, pointing, out, several, anecdotes, of, ieyasu, as, a, youth, showing, promise, as, a, capable, military, tactician, when, he, still, under, the, wing, of, the, imagawa, clan, he, was, capable, of, great, loyalty, once, he, allied, with, oda, nobunaga, he, never, went, against, him, and, both, leaders, profited, from, their, long, alliance, he, was, known, for, being, loyal, towards, his, personal, friends, and, vassals, whom, he, rewarded, he, was, said, to, have, a, close, friendship, with, his, vassal, hattori, hanz, however, he, also, remembered, those, who, had, wronged, him, in, the, past, it, is, said, that, ieyasu, executed, a, man, who, came, into, his, power, because, he, had, insulted, him, when, ieyasu, was, young, according, to, professor, watanabe, daimon, one, of, the, biggest, strengths, of, ieyasu, policies, were, his, benevolence, towards, his, subordinates, and, his, capability, to, forgive, his, enemies, and, even, his, own, generals, who, betrayed, him, during, the, mikawa, ikk, ikki, uprising, this, allowed, him, to, gain, the, loyalty, of, the, mikawa, samurai, clans, as, an, example, during, the, battle, of, mikatagahara, those, who, shielded, ieyasu, and, even, gave, their, lives, to, allow, his, retreat, were, the, ones, who, once, fought, against, ieyasu, in, the, past, and, were, pardoned, by, him, ieyasu, also, once, protected, many, former, takeda, retainers, from, the, wrath, of, oda, nobunaga, who, was, known, to, harbour, a, bitter, grudge, towards, the, takeda, he, managed, successfully, to, transform, many, of, the, retainers, of, the, takeda, h, j, and, imagawa, clans, all, whom, he, had, defeated, himself, or, helped, to, defeat, into, loyal, vassals, at, the, same, time, he, was, also, ruthless, when, crossed, for, example, he, ordered, the, executions, of, his, first, wife, and, his, eldest, son, a, son, in, law, of, oda, nobunaga, nobunaga, was, also, an, uncle, of, hidetada, s, wife, oeyo, however, according, to, george, sansom, ieyasu, was, cruel, relentless, and, merciless, in, the, elimination, of, toyotomi, survivors, after, osaka, for, days, scores, of, men, and, women, were, hunted, down, and, executed, including, an, eight, year, old, son, of, toyotomi, hideyori, by, a, concubine, who, was, beheaded, however, ieyasu, also, known, to, be, capable, of, forgiveness, such, as, how, he, gave, pardon, to, watanabe, moritsuna, after, he, rebelled, against, ieyasu, during, ikk, ikki, uprisings, in, mikawa, unlike, toyotomi, hideyoshi, he, harbored, no, desires, to, conquer, outside, of, japan, he, only, wanted, to, bring, order, and, an, end, to, open, warfare, and, to, rule, japan, ieyasu, s, favorite, pastime, was, falconry, he, regarded, it, as, excellent, training, for, a, warrior, when, you, go, into,

amount, of, walking, and, running, and, become, quite, indifferent, to, heat, and, cold, and, so, you, are, little, likely, to, suffer, from, any, illness, ieyasu, swam, often, even, late, in, his, life, he, is, reported, to, have, swum, in, the, moat, of, edo, castle, many, armors, are, said, to, have, been, used, by, ieyasu, and, at, least, 10, pieces, of, armor, were, used, by, ieyasu, during, his, life, and, recorded, in, history, while, warlords, at, the, time, preferred, flashy, armor, and, frontlets, to, show, off, their, presence, the, hada, gusoku, armor, used, by, ieyasu, in, the, siege, of, osaka, is, a, jet, black, armor, with, very, few, decoration, and, is, said, to, represent, ieyasu, s, frugal, personality, like, hideyoshi, ieyasu, also, presented, armor, to, europe, and, there, is, a, record, of, the, moji, i, domaru, armor, at, ambras, castle, in, austria, being, a, gift, from, the, emperor, and, empress, of, japan, to, holy, roman, emperor, rudolf, ii, this, armor, has, the, same, characteristics, as, the, aforementioned, hanairo, hinomaru, i, domaru, armor, and, armor, presented, by, hidetada, to, king, james, i, of, england, in, 1613, and, is, believed, to, have, been, presented, by, ieyasu, between, 1608, and, 1612, the, armor, has, the, characters, tenka, world, on, the, front, of, the, torso, and, left, sleeve, and, taihei, great, peace, on, the,
