was, crucial, for, his, ability, to, continue, as, a, writer, had, the, novel, been, lost, he, later, said, i, would, have, been, so, discouraged, that, i, would, probably, have, given, up, altogether, the, next, year, achebe, sent, his, novel, to, the, agent, recommended, by, gilbert, phelps, in, london, it, was, sent, to, several, publishing, houses, some, rejected, it, immediately,

supportive, one, review, in, the, magazine, black, orpheus, said, the, book, as, a, whole, creates, for, the, reader, such, a, vivid, picture, of, igbo, life, that, the, plot, and, characters, are,

ought, to, include, work, from, the, diaspora, or, solely, that, writing, composed, by, people, living, within, the, continent, itself, achebe, indicated, that, it, was, not, a, very, significant, question, and, that, scholars, would, do, well, to, wait, until, a, body, of, work, was, large, enough, to, judge, writing, about, the, conference, in, several, journals, achebe, hailed, it, as, a, milestone, for, the, literature, of, africa, and, highlighted, the, importance, of, community, among, isolated, voices, on, the, continent, and, beyond, while, at, makerere, achebe, was, asked, to,

military, crackdown, a, massacre, of, three, thousand, people, from, the, eastern, region, living, in, the, north, occurred, soon, afterwards, and, stories, of, other, attacks, on, igbo, nigerians, began, to, filter, into, lagos, the, ending, of, his, novel, had, brought, achebe, to, the, attention, of, the, nigerian, armed, forces, who, suspected, him, of, having, foreknowledge, of, the, coup, when, he, received, word, of, the, pursuit, he, sent, his, wife, who, was, pregnant, and, children, on, a, squalid, boat, through, a, series, of, unseen, creeks, to, the, eastern, stronghold, of, port, harcourt, they, arrived, safely, but, christie, suffered, a, miscarriage, at, the, journey, s, end, chinua, rejoined, them, soon, afterwards, in, ogidi, these, cities, were, safe, from, military, incursion, because, they, were, in, the, southeast, a, part, of, the, region, that, would, later, secede, once, the, family, had, resettled, in, enugu, achebe, and, his, friend, christopher, okigbo, started, a, publishing, house, called, citadel, press, to, improve, the, quality, and, increase, the, quantity, of, literature, available, to, younger, readers, one, of, its, first, submissions, was, a, story, called, how, the, dog, was, domesticated, which, achebe, revised, and, rewrote, turning, it, into, a, complex, allegory, for, the, country, s, political, tumult, its, final, title, was, how, the, leopard, got, his, claws, years, later, a, nigerian, intelligence, officer, told, achebe, of, all, the, things, that, came, out, of, biafra, that, book, was, most, important, in, may, 1967, the, southeastern, region, of, nigeria, broke, away, to, form, the, republic, of, biafra, in, july, the, nigerian, military, attacked, to, suppress, what, it, considered, an,

the, war, achebe, was, shaken, considerably, by, the, loss, in, 1971, he, wrote, dirge, for, okigbo, originally, in, the, igbo, language, but, later, translated, to, english, as, the, war, intensified, the, achebe, family, was, forced, to, leave, enugu, for, the, biafran, capital, of, aba, he, continued, to, write, throughout, the, war, but, most, of, his, creative, work, during, this, time, took, the, form, of, poetry, the, shorter, format, was, a, consequence, of, living, in, a, war, zone, i, can, write, poetry, he, said, something, short, intense, more, in, keeping, with, my, mood, all, this, is, creating, in, the, context, of, our, struggle, many, of, these, poems, were, collected, in, his, 1971, book, beware, soul, brother, one, of, his, most, famous, refugee, mother, and, child, spoke, to, the, suffering, and, loss, that, surrounded, him, dedicated, to, the, promise, of, biafra, he, accepted, a, request, to, serve, as, foreign, ambassador, refusing, an, invitation, from, the, program, of, african, studies, at, northwestern, university, in, the, us, meanwhile, their, contemporary, wole, soyinka, was, imprisoned, for, meeting, with, biafran, officials, and, spent, two, years, in, jail, speaking, in, 1968, achebe, said, i, find, the, nigerian, situation, untenable, if, i, had, been, a, nigerian, i, think, i, would, have, been, in, the, same, situation, as, wole, soyinka, is, in, prison, in, his, ambassador, role, achebe, travelled, to, european, and, north, american, cities, to, promote, the, biafra, cause, conditions, in, biafra, worsened, as, the, war, continued, in, september, 1968, the, city, of, aba, fell, to, the, nigerian, military, and, achebe, once, again, moved, his, family, this, time, to, umuahia, where, the, biafran, government, had, relocated, he, was, chosen, to, chair, the, newly, formed, national, guidance, committee, charged, with, the, task, of, drafting, principles, and, ideas, for, the, post, war, era, in, 1969, the, group, completed, a, document, entitled, the, principles, of, the, biafran, revolution, later, released, as, the, ahiara, declaration, in, october, of, the, same, year, achebe, joined, writers, cyprian, ekwensi, and, gabriel, okara, for, a, tour, of, the, united, states, to, raise, awareness, about, the, dire, situation, in, biafra, they, visited, thirty, college, campuses, and, conducted, numerous, interviews, although, the, group, was, well, received, by, students, and, faculty, achebe, was, shocked, by, the, harsh, racist, attitude, toward, africa, he, saw, in, the, us, at, the, end, of, the, tour, he, said, that, world, policy, is, absolutely, ruthless, and, unfeeling, the, beginning, of, 1970, saw, the, end, of, the, state, of, biafra, on, 12, january, the, military, surrendered, to, nigeria, and, achebe, returned, with, his, family, to, ogidi, where, their, home, had, been, destroyed, he, took, a, job, at, the, university, of, nigeria, in, nsukka, and, immersed, himself, once, again, in, academia, he, was, unable, to, accept, invitations, to, other, countries, however, because, the, nigerian, government, revoked, his, passport, due, to, his, support, for, biafra, the, achebe, family, had, another, daughter, on, 7, march, 1970, named, nwando, after, the, war, achebe, helped, start, two, magazines, in, 1971, the, literary, journal, okike, a, forum, for, african, art, fiction, and, poetry, and, nsukkascope, an, internal, publication, of, the, university, achebe, and, the, okike, committee, later, established, another, cultural, magazine, uwa, ndi, igbo, to, showcase, the, indigenous, stories, and, oral, traditions, of, the, igbo, community, achebe, handed, over, the, editorship, of, okike, to, onuora, osmond, enekwe, who, was, later, assisted, by, amechi, akwanya, in, february, 1972, chinua, achebe, released, girls, at, war, a, collection, of, short, stories, ranging, in, time, from, his, undergraduate, days, to, the, recent, bloodshed, it, was, the, 100th, book, in, heinemann, s, african, writers, series, the, university, of, massachusetts, amherst, offered, achebe, a, professorship, in, september, 1972, and, the, family, moved, to, the, united, states, their, youngest, daughter, was, displeased, with, her, nursery, school, and, the, family, soon, learned, that, her, frustration, involved, language, achebe, helped, her, face, what, he, called, the, alien, experience, by, telling, her, stories, during, the, car, trips, to, and, from, school, as, he, presented, his, lessons, to, a, wide, variety, of, students, he, taught, only, one, class, to, a, large, audience, he, began, to, study, the, perceptions, of, africa, in, western, scholarship, africa, is, not, like, anywhere, else, they, know, there, are, no, real, people, in, the, dark, continent, only, forces, operating, and, people, don, t, speak, any, language, you, can, understand, they, just, grunt, too, busy, jumping, up, and, down, in, a, frenzy, achebe, expanded, this, criticism, when, he, presented, a, chancellor, s, lecture, at, amherst, on, 18, february, 1975, an, image, of, africa, racism, in, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, decrying, joseph, conrad, as, a, bloody, racist, achebe, asserted, that, conrad, s, novel, heart, of, darkness, dehumanises, africans, rendering, africa, as, a, metaphysical, battlefield, devoid, of, all, recognisable, humanity, into, which, the, wandering, european, enters, at, his, peril, achebe, also, discussed, a, quotation, from, albert, schweitzer, a, 1952, nobel, peace, prize, laureate, that, extraordinary, missionary, albert, schweitzer, who, sacrificed, brilliant, careers, in, music, and, theology, in, europe, for, a, life, of, service, to, africans, in, much, the, same, area, as, conrad, writes, about, epitomizes, the, ambivalence, in, a, comment, which, has, often, been, quoted, schweitzer, says, the, african, is, indeed, my, brother, but, my, junior, brother, and, so, he, proceeded, to, build, a, hospital, appropriate, to, the, needs, of, junior, brothers, with, standards, of, hygiene, reminiscent, of, medical, practice, in, the, days, before, the, germ, theory, of, disease, came, into, being, the, lecture, was, controversial, immediately, following, his, talk, many, english, professors, in, attendance, were, upset, by, his, remarks, one, elderly, professor, reportedly, approached, him, said, how, dare, you, and, stormed, away, another, suggested, that, achebe, had, no, sense, of, humour, but, several, days, later, achebe, was, approached, by, a, third, professor, who, told, him, i, now, realize, that, i, had, never, really, read, heart, of, darkness, although, i, have, taught, it, for, years, achebe, s, criticism, has, become, a, mainstream, perspective, on, conrad, s, work, the, essay, was, included, in, the, 1988, norton, critical, edition, of, conrad, s, novel, editor, robert, kimbrough, called, it, one, of, the, three, most, important, events, in, heart, of, darkness, criticism, since, the, second, edition, of, his, book, critic, nicolas, tredell, divides, conrad, s, criticism, into, two, epochal, phases, before, and, after, achebe, asked, frequently, about, his, essay, achebe, once, explained, that, he, never, meant, for, the, work, to, be, abandoned, it, s, not, in, my, nature, to, talk, about, banning, books, i, am, saying, read, it, with, the, kind, of, understanding, and, with, the, knowledge, i, talk, about, and, read, it, beside, african, works, interviewed, on, national, public, radio, with, robert, siegel, in, october, 2009, achebe, stated, that, he, was, still, critical, of, heart, of, darkness, he, tempered, this, criticism, in, a, discussion, entitled, heart, of, darkness, is, inappropriate, stating, conrad, was, a, seductive, writer, he, could, pull, his, reader, into, the, fray, and, if, it, were, not, for, what, he, said, about, me, and, my, people, i, would, probably, be, thinking, only, of, that, seduction, after, his, service, at, umass, amherst, and, a, visiting, professorship, at, the, university, of, connecticut, achebe, returned, to, the, university, of, nigeria, in, 1976, where, he, held, a, chair, in, english, until, his, retirement, in, 1981, when, he, returned, to, the, university, of, nigeria, he, hoped, to, accomplish, three, goals, finish, the, novel, he, had, been, writing, renew, the, native, publication, of, okike, and, further, his, study, of, igbo, culture, in, an, august, 1976, interview, he, lashed, out, at, the, archetypal, nigerian, intellectual, stating, that, the, archetype, was, divorced, from, the, intellect, but, for, two, things, status, and, stomach, and, if, there, s, any, danger, that, he, might, suffer, official, displeasure, or, lose, his, job, he, would, prefer, to, turn, a, blind, eye, to, what, is, happening, around, him, in, october, 1979, achebe, was, awarded, the, first, ever, nigerian, national, merit, award, after, his, 1981, retirement, he, devoted, more, time, to, editing, okike, and, became, active, with, the, left, leaning, people, s, redemption, party, prp, in, 1983, he, became, the, party, s, deputy, national, vice, president, he, published, a, book, called, the, trouble, with, nigeria, to, coincide, with, the, upcoming, elections, on, the, first, page, achebe, says, the, nigerian, problem, is, the, unwillingness, or, inability, of, its, leaders, to, rise, to, the, responsibility, and, to, the, challenge, of, personal, example, which, are, the, hallmarks, of, true, leadership, the, elections, that, followed, were, marked, by, violence, and, charges, of, fraud, asked, whether, he, thought, nigerian, politics, had, changed, since, a, man, of, the, people, achebe, replied, i, think, if, anything, the, nigerian, politician, has, deteriorated, after, the, elections, he, engaged, in, a, heated, argument, which, almost, became, a, fistfight, with, sabo, bakin, zuwo, the, newly, elected, governor, of, kano, state, he, left, the, prp, and, kept, his, distance, from, political, parties, expressing, sadness, with, his, perception, of, the, dishonesty, and, weakness, of,

overseas, who, see, nothing, ever, new, out, of, africa, an, opinion, piece, in, the, magazine, west, africa, said, the, book, deserved, to, win, the, booker, prize, and, that, achebe, was, a, writer, who, has, long, deserved, the, recognition, that, has, already, been, accorded, him, by, his, sales, figures, the, prize, went, instead, to, penelope, lively, s, novel, moon, tiger, on, 22, march,

times, described, him, in, his, obituary, as, one, of, africa, s, most, widely, read, novelists, and, one, of, the, continent, s, towering, men, of, letters, the, bbc, wrote, that, he, was, revered, throughout, the, world, for, his, depiction, of, life, in, africa, he, was, buried, in, his, hometown, of, ogidi, the, style, of, achebe, s, fiction, draws, heavily, on, the, oral, tradition, of, the, igbo, people, he, incorporates, folk, tales, into, his, stories, exposing, community, values, in, both, the, content, and, the, form, of, storytelling, for, example, the, tale, about, the, earth, and, sky, in, things, fall, apart, emphasises, the, interdependency, of, the, masculine, and, the, feminine, although, nwoye, enjoys, hearing, his, mother, tell, the, tale, okonkwo, s, dislike, for, it, is, evidence, of, his, imbalance, achebe, used, proverbs, to, describe, the, values, of, the, rural, igbo, tradition, he, includes, them, throughout, the, narratives, repeating, points, made, in, conversation, critic, anjali, gera, notes, that, the, use, of, proverbs, in, arrow, of, god, serves, to, create, through, an, echo, effect, the, judgement, of, a, community, upon, an, individual, violation, the, use, of, such, repetition, in, achebe, s, urban, novels, no, longer, at, ease, and, a, man, of, the, people, is, less, pronounced, achebe, s, short, stories, are, not, as, widely, studied, as, his, novels, and, achebe, himself, did, not, consider, them, a, major, part, of, his, work, in, the, preface, for, girls, at, war, and, other, stories, he, writes, a, dozen, pieces, in, twenty, years, must, be, accounted, a, pretty, lean, harvest, by, any, reckoning, like, his, novels, the, short, stories, are, heavily, influenced, by, the, oral, tradition, they, often, have, morals, emphasising, the, importance, of, cultural, traditions, as, influenced, by, folk, tales, during, decolonisation, in, the, 1950s, a, debate, about, choice, of, language, erupted, and, pursued, authors, around, the, world, achebe, s, work, is, scrutinised, for, its, subject, matter, insistence, on, a, non, colonial, narrative, and, use, of, english, in, his, essay, english, and, the, african, writer, achebe, discusses, how, the, process, of, colonialism, for, all, its, ills, provided, colonised, people, from, varying, linguistic, backgrounds, a, language, with, which, to, talk, to, one, another, as, his, purpose, is, to, communicate, with, readers, across, nigeria, he, uses, the, one, central, language, enjoying, nationwide, currency, using, english, also, allowed, his, books, to, be, read, in, the, colonial, ruling, nations, achebe, recognises, the, shortcomings, of, what, audre, lorde, called, the, master, s, tools, in, another, essay, he, notes, for, an, african, writing, in, english, is, not, without, its, serious, setbacks, he, often, finds, himself, describing, situations, or, modes, of, thought, which, have, no, direct, equivalent, in, the, english, way, of, life, caught, in, that, situation, he, can, do, one, of, two, things, he, can, try, and, contain, what, he, wants, to, say, within, the, limits, of, conventional, english, or, he, can, try, to, push, back, those, limits, to, accommodate, his, ideas, i, submit, that, those, who, can, do, the, work, of, extending, the, frontiers, of, english, so, as, to, accommodate, african, thought, patterns, must, do, it, through, their, mastery, of, english, and, not, out, of, innocence, in, another, essay, he, refers, to, james, baldwin, s, struggle, to, use, the, english, language, to, accurately, represent, his, experience, and, his, realisation, that, he, needed, to, take, control, of, the, language, and, expand, it, achebe, s, novels, were, a, foundation, for, this, process, by, altering, syntax, usage, and, idiom, he, transformed, the, language, into, a, distinctly, african, style, in, some, spots, this, takes, the, form, of, repetition, of, an, igbo, idea, in, standard, english, parlance, elsewhere, it, appears, as, narrative, asides, integrated, into, descriptive, sentences, in, his, early, writing, a, depiction, of, the, igbo, culture, itself, is, paramount, critic, nahem, yousaf, highlights, the, importance, of, these, depictions, around, the, tragic, stories, of, okonkwo, and, ezeulu, achebe, sets, about, textualising, igbo, cultural, identity, the, portrayal, of, indigenous, life, is, not, simply, a, matter, of, literary, background, he, adds, achebe, seeks, to, produce, the, effect, of, a, precolonial, reality, as, an, igbo, centric, response, to, a, eurocentrically, constructed, imperial, reality, certain, elements, of, achebe, s, depiction, of, igbo, life, in, things, fall, apart, match, those, in, olaudah, equiano, s, autobiographical, narrative, responding, to, charges, that, equiano, was, not, actually, born, in, africa, achebe, wrote, in, 1975, equiano, was, an, igbo, i, believe, from, the, village, of, iseke, in, the, orlu, division, of, nigeria, at, a, time, when, african, writers, were, being, admonished, for, being, obsessed, with, the, past, achebe, argued, that, confronted, by, colonial, denigration, evacuated, from, the, category, of, the, human, and, denied, the, capacity, for, thinking, and, creativity, the, african, needed, a, narrative, of, redemption, a, redemptive, hermeneutics, was, pegged, on, a, deep, historical, sense, simon, gikandi, a, prevalent, theme, in, achebe, s, novels, is, the, intersection, of, african, tradition, particularly, igbo, varieties, and, modernity, especially, as, embodied, by, european, colonialism, for, example, the, village, of, umuofia, in, things, fall, apart, is, violently, shaken, with, internal, divisions, when, the, white, christian, missionaries, arrive, nigerian, english, professor, ernest, n, emenyonu, describes, the, colonial, experience, in, the, novel, as, the, systematic, emasculation, of, the, entire, culture, achebe, later, embodied, this, tension, between, african, tradition, and, western, influence, in, the, figure, of, sam, okoli, the, president, of, kangan, in, anthills, of, the, savannah, distanced, from, the, myths, and, tales, of, the, community, by, his, westernised, education, he, does, not, have, the, capacity, for, reconnection, shown, by, the, character, beatrice, the, colonial, impact, on, the, igbo, in, achebe, s, novels, is, often, affected, by, individuals, from, europe, but, institutions, and, urban, offices, frequently, serve, a, similar, purpose, the, character, of, obi, in, no, longer, at, ease, succumbs, to, colonial, era, corruption, in, the, city, the, temptations, of, his, position, overwhelm, his, identity, and, fortitude, having, shown, his, acumen, for, portraying, traditional, igbo, culture, in, things, fall, apart, achebe, demonstrated, in, no, longer, at, ease, an, ability, to, depict, modern, nigerian, life, the, standard, achebean, ending, results, in, the, destruction, of, an, individual, which, leads, to, the, downfall, of, the, community, odili, s, descent, into, the, luxury, of, corruption, and, hedonism, in, a, man, of, the, people, for, example, is, symbolic, of, the, post, colonial, crisis, in, nigeria, and, elsewhere, even, with, the, emphasis, on, colonialism, achebe, s, tragic, endings, embody, the, traditional, confluence, of, fate, individual, and, society, as, represented, by, sophocles, and, shakespeare, achebe, seeks, to, portray, neither, moral, absolutes, nor, a, fatalistic, inevitability, in, 1972, he, said, i, never, will, take, the, stand, that, the, old, must, win, or, that, the, new, must, win, the, point, is, that, no, single, truth, satisfied, me, and, this, is, well, founded, in, the, igbo, worldview, no, single, man, can, be, correct, all, the, time, no, single, idea, can, be, totally, correct, his, perspective, is, reflected, in, the, words, of, ikem, a, character, in, anthills, of, the, savannah, whatever, you, are, is, never, enough, you, must, find, a, way, to, accept, something, however, small, from, the, other, to, make, you, whole, and, to, save, you, from, the, mortal, sin, of, righteousness, and, extremism, in, a, 1996, interview, achebe, said, belief, in, either, radicalism, or, orthodoxy, is, too, simplified, a, way, of, viewing, things, evil, is, never, all, evil, goodness, on, the, other, hand, is, often, tainted, with, selfishness, the, gender, roles, of, men, and, women, as, well, as, society, s, conceptions, of, the, associated, concepts, are, frequent, themes, in, achebe, s, writing, he, has, been, criticised, as, a, sexist, author, in, response, to, what, many, call, the, uncritical, depiction, of, traditionally, patriarchal, igbo, society, where, the, most, masculine, men, take, numerous, wives, and, women, are, beaten, regularly, paradoxically, igbo, society, immensely, values, individual, achievement, but, also, sees, the, ownership, over, or, acquisition, of, women, as, a, signifier, of, success, the, african, studies, scholar, rose, ure, mezu, suggests, that, achebe, is, representing, the, limited, gendered, vision, of, the, characters, or, that, he, purposefully, created, exaggerated, gender, binaries, to, render, igbo, history, recognizable, to, international, readers, conversely, the, scholar, ajoke, mimiko, bestman, has, stated, that, reading, achebe, through, the, lens, of, womanism, is, an, afrocentric, concept, forged, out, of, global, feminism, to, analyze, the, condition, of, black, african, women, which, acknowledges, the, patriarchal, oppression, of, women, and, highlights, the, resistance, and, dignity, of, african, women, which, enables, an, understanding, of, igbo, conceptions, of, gender, complementarity, according, to, bestman, in, things, fall, apart, okonkwo, s, furious, manhood, overpowers, everything, feminine, in, his, life, including, his, own, conscience, while, achebe, s, depiction, of, the, chi, or, personal, god, has, been, called, the, mother, within, okonkwo, s, father, was, considered, an, agbala, a, word, that, refers, to, a, man, without, title, but, is, also, synonymous, with, woman, okonkwo, s, feminization, of, his, father, s, laziness, and, cowardice, is, typical, of, the, igbo, perspective, on, any, man, seen, as, unsuccessful, his, obsession, with, maleness, is, fueled, by, an, intense, fear, of, femaleness, which, he, expresses, through, the, physical, and, verbal, abuse, of, his, wives, his, violence, towards, his, community, his, constant, worry, that, his, son, nwoye, is, not, manly, enough, and, his, wish, that, his, daughter, ezinma, had, been, born, a, boy, the, women, in, the, novel, are, obedient, quiet, and, absent, from, positions, of, authority, despite, the, fact, that, igbo, women, were, traditionally, involved, in, village, leadership, the, desire, for, feminine, balance, is, highlighted, by, ani, the, earth, goddess, and, the, extended, discussion, of, nneka, mother, is, supreme, in, chapter, fourteen, the, perseverance, and, love, from, okonkwo, s, second, wife, ekwefi, towards, ezinma, despite, her, many, miscarriages, is, seen, as, a, tribute, to, igbo, womanhood, which, is, typically, defined, by, motherhood, okonkwo, s, defeat, is, seen, by, mezu, and, literature, scholar, nahem, yousaf, as, a, vindication, of, the, need, for, a, balancing, feminine, ethos, bestman, argued, that, okonkwo, s, failures, are, tied, to, his, contempt, for, and, fear, of, women, and, his, inability, to, form, quality, personal, relationships, with, the, women, in, his, life, achebe, expressed, frustration, at, frequently, being, misunderstood, on, this, point, saying, that, i, want, to, sort, of, scream, that, things, fall, apart, is, on, the, side, of, women, and, that, okonkwo, is, paying, the, penalty, for, his, treatment, of, women, that, all, his, problems, all, the, things, he, did, wrong, can, be, seen, as, offenses, against, the, feminine, on, this, bestman, states, that, okonkwo, s, violent, and, vehement, anti, women, position, is, the, exception, not, the, norm, within, his, community, of, umuofia, and, the, wider, igbo, society, it, is, a, tag, of, either, literary, ignorance, or, momentary, exuberance, those, who, seriously, believe, or, promote, this, must, be, asked, have, you, the, sheerest, acquaintance, with, the, literature, of, other, african, nations, in, both, indigenous, and, adopted, colonial, languages, education, is, lacking, in, most, of, those, who, pontificate, chinua, achebe, on, being, called,
