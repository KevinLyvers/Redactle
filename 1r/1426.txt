to, return, to, due, to, the, unfolding, french, revolution, which, had, begun, in, 1789, in, the, summers, he, worked, with, his, father, who, had, been, appointed, plenipotentiary, and, effective, ruler, of, the, austrian, netherlands, in, march, 1792, francis, succeeded, as, holy, roman, emperor, and, was, crowned, in, july, affording, metternich, a, reprise, of, his, earlier, role, of, ceremonial, marshal, in, the, meantime, france, had, declared, war, on, austria, beginning, the, war, of, the, first, coalition, 1792, 7, and, making, metternich, s, further, study, in, mainz, impossible, now, in, the, employment, of, his, father, he, was, sent, on, a, special, mission, to, the, front, here, he, led, the, interrogation, of, the, french, minister, of, war, the, marquis, de, beurnonville, and, several, accompanying, national, convention, commissioners, metternich, observed, the, siege, and, fall, of, valenciennes, later, looking, back, on, these, as, substantial, lessons, about, warfare, in, early, 1794, he, was, sent, to, england, ostensibly, on, official, business, helping, viscount, desandrouin, the, treasurer, general, of, the, austrian, netherlands, to, negotiate, a, loan, in, england, he, met, king, george, iii, on, several, occasions, and, dined, with, a, number, of, influential, british, politicians, including, william, pitt, charles, james, fox, and, edmund, burke, he, also, dined, with, the, renowned, composer, joseph, haydn, and, his, impresario, johann, peter, salomon, after, seeing, several, of, their, concerts, at, hanover, square, it, was, at, one, of, these, concerts, where, he, recognized, his, one, time, teacher, andreas, hofmann, in, the, audience, who, went, to, spy, on, england, for, the, french, metternich, was, nominated, the, new, minister, plenipotentiary, to, the, austrian, netherlands, and, left, england, in, september, 1794, on, arrival, he, found, an, exiled, and, powerless, government, in, a, headlong, retreat, from, the, latest, french, advance, in, october, a, revitalised, french, army, swept, into, germany, and, annexed, all, of, the, metternich, estates, except, k, nigswart, disappointed, and, affected, by, strong, criticism, of, his, father, s, policies, he, joined, his, parents, in, vienna, in, november, on, 27, september, 1795, he, married, countess, eleonore, von, kaunitz, rietberg, 1775, 1825,

wenzel, anton, prince, of, kaunitz, rietberg, the, marriage, was, arranged, by, metternich, s, mother, and, introduced, him, to, viennese, society, this, was, undoubtedly, part, of, the, motivation, for, metternich, who, demonstrated, less, affection, for, her, than, she, for, him, two, conditions, were, imposed, by, the, father, of, the, bride, prince, kaunitz, first, the, still, youthful, eleonore, was, to, continue, to, live, at, home, and, second, metternich, was, forbidden, from, serving, as, a, diplomat, as, long, as, the, prince, was, still, alive, their, daughter, maria, was, born, in, january, 1797, after, metternich, s, studies, in, vienna, the, prince, s, death, in, september, 1797, allowed, metternich, to, participate, in, the, congress, of, rastatt, initially, his, father, who, headed, the, imperial, delegation, took, him, as, a, secretary, while, ensuring, that, when, proceedings, officially, started, in, december, 1797, he, was, named, the, representative, of, the, catholic, bench, of, the, college, of, the, counts, of, westphalia, a, bored, metternich, remained, at, rastatt, in, this, role, until, 1799, when, the, congress, was, finally, wound, down, during, this, period, eleonore, had, chosen, to, live, with, metternich, at, rastatt, and, gave, birth, to, sons, francis, february, 1798, and, shortly, after, the, end, of, the, congress, klemens, june, 1799, much, to, metternich, s, anguish, klemens, died, after, only, a, few, days, and, francis, soon, contracted, a, lung, infection, from, which, he, would, never, recover, the, holy, roman, empire, s, defeat, in, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, shook, up, diplomatic, circles, and, the, promising, metternich, was, now, offered, a, choice, between, three, ministerial, positions, to, the, imperial, diet, at, regensburg, to, the, kingdom, of, denmark, at, copenhagen, or, to, the, electorate, of, saxony, at, dresden, he, chose, dresden, in, late, january, 1801, and, his, appointment, was, officially, announced, in, february, metternich, summered, in, vienna, where, he, wrote, his, instructions, a, memorandum, showing, a, much, greater, understanding, of, statesmanship, than, his, earlier, writing, he, visited, the, k, nigswart, estate, in, the, autumn, before, taking, up, his, new, position, on, 4, november, the, subtleties, of, the, memorandum, were, lost, on, the, saxon, court, which, was, headed, by, the, retiring, frederick, augustus, i, a, man, with, little, political, initiative, despite, the, boredom, of, the, court, metternich, enjoyed, the, light, hearted, frivolity, of, the, city, and, took, up, a, mistress, princess, katharina, bagration, mukhranska, who, bore, him, a, daughter, marie, clementine, in, january, 1803, metternich, and, his, wife, had, a, child, whom, they, named, viktor, in, dresden, metternich, also, made, a, number, of, important, contacts, including, friedrich, gentz, a, publicist, who, would, serve, metternich, as, both, confidant, and, critic, for, the, next, thirty, years, he, also, established, links, with, important, polish, and, french, political, figures, count, metternich, is, young, but, by, no, means, maladroit, we, shall, see, how, he, shapes, up, in, berlin, to, compensate, for, the, loss, of, the, metternich, s, ancestral, estates, in, the, moselle, valley, when, the, french, republic, annexed, the, west, bank, of, the, rhine, the, imperial, recess, of, 1803, brought, metternich, s, family, new, estates, in, ochsenhausen, the, title, of, prince, and, a, seat, in, the, imperial, diet, in, the, ensuing, diplomatic, reshuffle, metternich, was, appointed, ambassador, to, the, kingdom, of, prussia, being, notified, of, this, in, february, 1803, and, taking, his, position, in, november, of, that, year, he, arrived, in, prussia, at, a, critical, juncture, in, european, diplomacy, soon, growing, worried, about, the, territorial, ambitions, of, napoleon, bonaparte, newly, the, leader, of, france, this, fear, was, shared, by, the, russian, court, under, alexander, i, and, the, tsar, kept, metternich, informed, of, russian, policy, by, autumn, of, 1804, vienna, decided, on, action, entered, into, in, august, 1805, when, the, austrian, empire, as, the, habsburg, monarchy, was, in, the, process, of, becoming, began, its, involvement, in, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, metternich, s, now, almost, impossible, task, was, to, convince, prussia, to, join, the, coalition, against, bonaparte, their, eventual, agreement, was, not, due, to, metternich, however, and, after, the, coalition, s, defeat, at, the, battle, of, austerlitz, prussia, disregarded, the, agreement, and, signed, a, treaty, with, the, french, instead, in, the, ensuing, reshuffle, in, vienna, johann, philipp, stadion, count, von, warthausen, became, the, foreign, minister, of, austrian, empire, freeing, metternich, to, assume, the, post, of, ambassador, to, the, russian, empire, he, never, made, it, to, russia, as, need, had, arisen, for, a, new, austrian, at, the, french, court, metternich, was, approved, for, the, post, in, june, 1806, he, enjoyed, being, in, demand, and, was, happy, to, be, sent, to, france, on, a, generous, salary, of, 90, 000, florins, a, year, after, an, arduous, trip, he, took, up, residence, in, august, 1806, being, briefed, by, baron, von, vincent, and, engelbert, von, floret, whom, he, would, retain, as, a, close, adviser, for, two, decades, he, met, french, foreign, minister, prince, charles, maurice, de, talleyrand, p, rigord, on, 5, august, and, napoleon, himself, five, days, later, at, ch, teau, de, saint, cloud, the, war, of, the, fourth, coalition, drew, both, talleyrand, and, napoleon, eastwards, after, the, treaties, of, tilsit, of, july, 1807, metternich, saw, that, austria, s, position, in, europe, was, much, more, vulnerable, but, believed, the, accord, between, russia, and, france, would, not, last, in, the, meantime, he, found, the, new, french, foreign, minister, jean, baptiste, champagny, unaccommodating, and, struggled, to, negotiate, a, satisfactory, settlement, over, the, future, of, several, french, forts, on, the, river, inn, over, the, following, months, the, reach, of, austrian, policy, and, metternich, s, own, reputation, increased, in, a, memorable, event, metternich, argued, with, napoleon, at, napoleon, s, 39th, birthday, celebrations, in, august, 1808, over, the, increasingly, obvious, preparations, for, war, on, both, sides, soon, after, napoleon, refused, metternich, s, attendance, at, the, congress, of, erfurt, metternich, was, later, glad, to, hear, from, talleyrand, that, napoleon, s, attempts, at, the, congress, to, get, russia, to, invade, austria, had, proved, unsuccessful, in, a, report, to, stadion, metternich, the, ambassador, concluded, that, the, house, of, hohenzollern, had, been, relegated, and, that, austria, s, situation, had, worsened, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, was, hostile, to, austria, and, a, military, conflict, with, france, would, have, to, be, fought, on, two, fronts, between, the, weichsel, river, and, the, inn, river, metternich, continued, to, oppose, a, war, with, france, and, pointed, out, that, the, government, in, vienna, only, needed, to, wait, as, napoleon, had, no, plans, for, his, own, succession, now, back, in, austria, metternich, witnessed, first, hand, the, austrian, army, s, defeat, at, the, battle, of, wagram, in, 1809, stadion, tendered, his, resignation, as, foreign, minister, in, the, aftermath, and, the, emperor, immediately, offered, the, post, to, metternich, metternich, worried, that, napoleon, would, seize, on, this, to, demand, harsher, peace, terms, instead, agreed, to, become, a, minister, of, state, which, he, did, on, 8, july, and, to, lead, negotiations, with, the, french, on, the, understanding, that, he, would, replace, stadion, as, foreign, minister, at, a, later, date, during, peace, talks, at, altenburg, metternich, put, forward, pro, french, proposals, to, save, the, austrian, monarchy, napoleon, however, disliked, his, position, on, the, future, of, poland, and, metternich, was, gradually, displaced, from, the, proceedings, by, prince, liechtenstein, he, soon, regained, influence, however, on, 8, october, as, foreign, minister, and, additionally, that, of, minister, of, the, imperial, household, in, early, 1810, metternich, s, earlier, affair, with, junot, became, public, but, because, of, eleonore, s, understanding, the, scandal, was, minimal, one, of, metternich, s, first, tasks, was, to, push, for, the, marriage, of, napoleon, to, archduchess, marie, louise, rather, than, to, the, tsar, s, youngest, sister, anna, pavlovna, metternich, would, later, seek, to, distance, himself, from, the, marriage, by, claiming, it, was, napoleon, s, own, idea, but, this, is, improbable, in, any, case, he, was, happy, to, claim, responsibility, at, the, time, by, 7, february, napoleon, had, agreed, and, the, pair, were, married, by, proxy, on, 11, march, marie, louise, left, for, france, soon, after, and, metternich, followed, by, a, different, route, and, unofficially, the, trip, was, designed, metternich, explained, to, transport, his, family, stranded, in, france, by, the, outbreak, of, war, home, and, to, report, to, the, austrian, emperor, about, marie, louise, s, activities, instead, metternich, stayed, six, months, entrusting, his, office, in, vienna, to, his, father, he, set, about, using, the, marriage, and, flattery, to, renegotiate, the, terms, set, out, in, the, treaty, of, sch, nbrunn, the, concessions, he, won, were, trivial, however, a, few, trading, rights, delay, in, the, payment, of, the, war, indemnity, restitution, of, some, estates, belonging, to, germans, in, the, austrian, service, including, the, metternich, family, s, and, the, lifting, of, a, 150, 000, man, limit, on, the, austrian, army, the, last, was, particularly, welcomed, as, a, sign, of, increased, austrian, independence, although, austria, could, no, longer, afford, an, army, greater, than, the, limit, prescribed, when, metternich, returned, to, vienna, in, october, 1810, he, was, no, longer, as, popular, his, influence, was, limited, to, foreign, affairs, and, his, attempts, to, get, a, full, council, of, state, reintroduced, had, failed, convinced, that, a, much, weakened, austria, should, avoid, another, invasion, by, france, he, rejected, the, advances, of, tsar, alexander, and, instead, concluded, an, alliance, with, napoleon, on, 14, march, 1812, he, also, supported, a, period, of, moderate, censorship, aimed, at, preventing, provocation, of, the, french, requiring, that, only, 30, 000, austrian, troops, fight, alongside, the, french, the, alliance, treaty, was, more, generous, than, the, one, prussia, had, signed, a, month, earlier, this, allowed, metternich, to, give, both, britain, and, russia, assurances, that, austria, remained, committed, to, curbing, napoleonic, ambitions, he, accompanied, his, sovereign, for, a, final, meeting, with, napoleon, at, dresden, in, may, 1812, before, napoleon, embarked, upon, the, french, invasion, of, russia, the, dresden, meeting, revealed, that, austria, s, influence, in, europe, had, reached, its, lowest, point, and, metternich, was, now, bent, on, re, establishing, that, influence, by, using, what, he, considered, strong, ties, with, all, sides, in, the, war, proposing, general, peace, talks, headed, by, austria, over, the, next, three, months, he, would, slowly, distance, austria, from, the, french, cause, while, avoiding, alliance, with, either, prussia, or, russia, and, remaining, open, to, any, proposal, that, would, secure, a, place, for, the, combined, bonaparte, habsburg, dynasty, this, was, driven, by, concern, that, if, napoleon, were, defeated, russia, and, prussia, would, stand, to, gain, too, much, napoleon, was, intransigent, however, and, the, fighting, now, officially, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, continued, austria, s, alliance, with, france, ended, in, february, 1813, and, austria, then, moved, to, a, position, of, armed, neutrality, metternich, was, much, less, keen, on, turning, against, france, than, many, of, his, contemporaries, though, not, the, emperor, and, he, favoured, his, own, plans, for, a, general, settlement, in, november, 1813, he, offered, napoleon, the, frankfurt, proposals, which, would, allow, napoleon, to, remain, emperor, but, would, reduce, france, to, its, natural, frontiers, and, undo, its, control, of, most, of, italy, germany, and, the, netherlands, napoleon, victorious, at, the, battles, of, lutzen, and, bautzen, delayed, too, long, and, lost, this, opportunity, by, december, he, had, been, defeated, at, the, battle, of, leipzig, and, the, allies, had, withdrawn, the, offer, by, early, 1814, as, they, were, closing, in, on, paris, napoleon, agreed, to, the, frankfurt, proposals, too, late, and, he, rejected, the, new, harsher, terms, then, proposed, nevertheless, the, allies, were, not, faring, well, and, although, a, statement, of, general, war, aims, that, included, many, nods, to, austria, was, secured, from, russia, britain, remained, distrustful, and, generally, unwilling, to, give, up, the, military, initiative, she, had, fought, 20, years, to, establish, despite, this, francis, created, the, austrian, foreign, minister, grand, chancellor, of, the, order, of, maria, theresa, a, post, which, had, been, vacant, since, the, time, of, kaunitz, metternich, increasingly, worried, that, napoleon, s, retreat, would, bring, with, it, disorder, that, would, harm, the, habsburgs, a, peace, had, to, be, concluded, soon, he, believed, since, britain, could, not, be, coerced, he, sent, proposals, to, france, and, russia, only, these, were, rejected, though, after, the, battles, of, battle, of, l, tzen, 2, may, and, battle, of, bautzen, 20, 21, may, a, french, initiated, truce, was, called, starting, in, april, metternich, began, to, slowly, and, reluctantly, prepare, austria, for, war, with, france, the, armistice, provided, austria, time, for, fuller, complete, mobilisation, in, june, metternich, left, vienna, to, personally, handle, negotiations, at, gitschin, in, bohemia, when, he, arrived, he, benefitted, from, the, hospitality, of, princess, wilhelmine, duchess, of, sagan, and, began, an, affair, with, her, that, lasted, several, months, no, other, mistress, ever, achieved, such, influence, over, metternich, as, wilhelmine, and, he, would, continue, to, write, to, her, after, their, separation, meanwhile, french, foreign, minister, hugues, bernard, maret, remained, elusive, though, metternich, did, manage, to, discuss, the, state, of, affairs, with, the, tsar, on, 18, 19, june, at, opotschna, in, talks, which, would, later, be, ratified, as, the, reichenbach, convention, they, agreed, on, general, peace, demands, and, set, out, a, process, by, which, austria, could, enter, the, war, on, the, coalition, side, shortly, afterwards, metternich, was, invited, to, join, napoleon, at, dresden, where, he, could, put, the, terms, directly, though, no, reliable, record, of, their, meeting, on, 26, june, 1813, exists, it, seems, it, was, a, stormy, but, effective, meeting, the, agreement, was, finally, reached, as, metternich, was, about, to, leave, peace, talks, would, start, in, prague, in, july, and, run, until, 20, august, in, agreeing, to, this, metternich, had, ignored, the, reichenbach, convention, and, this, angered, austria, s, coalition, allies, the, conference, of, prague, would, never, properly, meet, since, napoleon, gave, his, representatives, armand, caulaincourt, and, the, count, of, narbonne, insufficient, powers, to, negotiate, at, the, informal, discussions, held, in, lieu, of, the, conference, caulaincourt, implied, that, napoleon, would, not, negotiate, until, an, allied, army, threatened, france, itself, this, convinced, metternich, and, after, an, ultimatum, metternich, issued, to, france, went, unheeded, austria, declared, war, on, 12, august, austria, s, allies, saw, the, declaration, as, an, admission, that, austria, s, diplomatic, ambitions, had, failed, but, metternich, viewed, it, as, one, move, in, a, much, longer, campaign, for, the, rest, of, the, war, he, strove, to, hold, the, coalition, together, and, as, such, to, curb, russian, momentum, in, europe, to, this, end, he, won, an, early, victory, as, an, austrian, general, the, prince, of, schwarzenberg, was, confirmed, supreme, commander, of, the, coalition, forces, rather, than, tsar, alexander, i, he, also, succeeded, in, getting, the, three, allied, monarchs, alexander, francis, and, prussia, s, frederick, william, iii, to, follow, him, and, their, armies, on, campaign, with, the, treaty, of, t, plitz, metternich, allowed, austria, to, remain, uncommitted, over, the, future, of, france, italy, and, poland, he, was, still, confined, however, by, the, british, who, were, subsidizing, prussia, and, russia, in, september, metternich, requested, subsidies, for, austria, as, well, meanwhile, the, coalition, forces, took, the, offensive, on, 18, october, 1813, metternich, witnessed, the, successful, battle, of, leipzig, and, two, days, later, he, was, rewarded, for, his, wise, direction, with, the, rank, of, prince, german, f, rst, metternich, was, delighted, when, frankfurt, was, retaken, in, early, november, and, in, particular, by, the, deference, the, tsar, showed, francis, at, a, ceremony, organised, there, by, metternich, diplomatically, with, the, war, drawing, to, a, close, he, remained, determined, to, prevent, the, creation, of, a, strong, unified, german, state, even, offering, napoleon, generous, terms, in, order, to, retain, him, as, a, counterweight, on, 2, december, 1813, napoleon, agreed, to, talk, though, these, talks, were, delayed, by, the, need, for, the, participation, of, a, more, senior, british, diplomat, viscount, castlereagh, before, talks, could, begin, coalition, armies, crossed, the, rhine, on, 22, december, metternich, retired, from, frankfurt, to, breisgau, to, celebrate, christmas, with, his, wife, s, family, before, travelling, to, the, new, coalition, headquarters, at, basel, in, january, 1814, quarrels, with, tsar, alexander, particularly, over, the, fate, of, france, this, rivalry, intensified, in, january, prompting, alexander, to, storm, out, he, therefore, missed, the, arrival, of, castlereagh, in, mid, january, metternich, and, castlereagh, formed, a, good, working, relationship, and, then, met, with, alexander, at, langres, the, tsar, remained, unaccommodating, however, demanding, a, push, into, the, centre, of, france, but, he, was, too, preoccupied, to, object, to, metternich, s, other, ideas, like, a, final, peace, conference, in, vienna, metternich, did, not, attend, talks, with, the, french, at, ch, tillon, as, he, wanted, to, stay, with, alexander, the, talks, stalled, and, after, a, brief, advance, coalition, forces, had, to, retreat, after, the, battle, of, montmirail, and, battle, of, montereau, this, relieved, metternich, s, fears, that, an, overconfident, alexander, might, act, unilaterally, you, have, no, idea, what, sufferings, the, people, at, headquarters, impose, upon, us, i, cannot, stand, it, much, longer, and, the, emperor, francis, is, already, ill, are, all, mad, and, belong, in, the, lunatic, asylum, metternich, continued, negotiations, with, the, french, envoy, caulaincourt, through, early, to, mid, march, 1814, when, victory, at, the, battle, of, laon, put, the, coalition, back, on, the, offensive, by, this, time, metternich, was, tiring, of, trying, to, hold, the, coalition, together, and, even, the, british, engineered, treaty, of, chaumont, did, not, help, in, the, absence, of, the, prussians, and, russians, the, coalition, agreed, to, the, restoration, of, the, bourbon, dynasty, francis, rejected, a, final, plea, from, napoleon, that, he, would, abdicate, in, favour, of, his, son, with, marie, louise, as, regent, and, paris, fell, on, 30, march, military, manoeuvres, had, forced, metternich, westward, to, dijon, on, 24, march, and, now, after, a, deliberate, delay, he, left, for, the, french, capital, on, 7, april, on, 10, april, he, found, a, city, at, peace, and, much, to, his, annoyance, largely, in, the, control, of, tsar, alexander, the, austrians, disliked, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, fontainebleau, that, russia, had, imposed, on, napoleon, in, their, absence, but, metternich, was, reluctant, to, oppose, them, and, on, 11, april, signed, the, treaty, thereafter, he, focused, on, safeguarding, austrian, interests, in, the, forthcoming, peace, asserting, austria, s, influence, in, germany, over, that, of, prussia, and, undoing, russian, ascendancy, for, these, reasons, he, ensured, that, the, italian, provinces, of, lombardy, and, venetia, lost, to, french, client, states, in, 1805, were, duly, re, annexed, as, the, kingdom, of, lombardy, venetia, on, the, division, of, formerly, french, occupied, poland, and, germany, metternich, was, more, confined, by, the, interests, of, the, allies, after, two, failed, proposals, advanced, by, the, prussians, the, issue, was, postponed, until, after, a, peace, treaty, had, been, signed, elsewhere, metternich, like, many, of, his, counterparts, was, anxious, to, provide, the, renewed, french, monarchy, with, the, resources, to, maintain, control, the, generous, treaty, of, paris, was, signed, on, 30, may, now, free, metternich, accompanied, tsar, alexander, to, england, wilhelmine, who, had, followed, metternich, to, paris, also, made, the, crossing, a, triumphant, metternich, filled, his, four, weeks, with, revelry, re, establishing, his, reputation, and, that, of, austria, he, was, also, awarded, an, honorary, law, degree, from, the, university, of, oxford, by, contrast, and, to, metternich, s, pleasure, alexander, was, ill, mannered, and, often, insulting, despite, the, opportunities, little, diplomacy, took, place, instead, all, that, was, firmly, agreed, was, that, proper, discussions, would, take, place, at, vienna, with, a, date, tentatively, set, for, 15, august, when, the, tsar, tried, to, postpone, it, to, october, metternich, agreed, but, effected, conditions, that, prevented, alexander, from, exercising, any, advantage, due, to, his, de, facto, control, of, poland, metternich, was, eventually, reunited, with, his, family, in, austria, in, the, middle, of, july, 1814, having, stopped, for, a, week, in, france, to, soothe, fears, surrounding, napoleon, s, wife, marie, louise, now, the, duchess, of, parma, his, return, to, vienna, was, celebrated, by, an, occasional, cantata, that, included, the, line, history, holds, thee, up, to, posterity, as, a, model, among, great, men, in, the, autumn, of, 1814, the, heads, of, the, five, reigning, dynasties, and, representatives, from, 216, noble, families, began, gathering, in, vienna, before, ministers, from, the, big, four, the, coalition, allies, of, britain, austria, prussia, and, russia, arrived, metternich, stayed, quietly, in, baden, bei, wien, two, hours, to, the, south, when, he, heard, they, had, reached, vienna, he, journeyed, to, meet, them, and, encouraged, them, to, go, with, him, back, to, baden, they, declined, and, four, meetings, were, held, in, the, city, itself, in, these, the, representatives, agreed, on, how, the, congress, would, operate, and, to, metternich, s, delight, named, his, own, aide, friedrich, von, gentz, secretary, to, the, negotiations, of, the, big, six, the, big, four, plus, france, and, spain, when, talleyrand, and, spanish, representative, don, pedro, labrador, learned, of, these, decisions, they, were, incensed, that, agreements, were, negotiated, by, the, big, four, only, sweden, and, portugal, were, similarly, angered, by, their, exclusion, from, all, but, the, full, congress, especially, since, metternich, was, determined, to, give, the, latter, grouping, as, little, power, as, possible, as, a, result, the, big, six, became, the, preliminary, committee, of, the, eight, whose, first, decision, was, that, the, congress, itself, be, postponed, to, 1, november, in, fact, it, would, soon, be, postponed, again, with, only, a, minor, commission, beginning, work, in, november, in, the, meantime, metternich, organised, a, controversially, vast, array, of, entertainments, for, the, delegates, including, himself, leaving, castlereagh, to, negotiate, on, tsar, alexander, s, behalf, metternich, briefly, turned, his, attention, to, quelling, anti, habsburg, feeling, in, italy, around, the, same, time, he, learnt, that, the, duchess, of, sagan, was, courting, the, tsar, disappointed, and, exhausted, by, social, rounds, metternich, let, his, guard, drop, angering, tsar, alexander, during, negotiations, over, poland, then, ruled, by, napoleon, as, the, grand, duchy, of, warsaw, by, implying, austria, could, match, russia, militarily, despite, the, blunder, francis, refused, to, dismiss, his, foreign, minister, and, political, crisis, rocked, vienna, throughout, november, culminating, in, a, declaration, by, tsar, alexander, that, russia, would, not, compromise, in, its, claim, on, poland, as, a, satellite, kingdom, the, coalition, rejected, this, utterly, and, the, agreement, seemed, further, off, than, ever, during, the, stand, off, it, seems, that, alexander, even, went, as, far, as, to, challenge, metternich, to, a, duel, however, tsar, alexander, soon, did, a, rapid, volte, face, and, agreed, to, the, division, of, poland, he, also, softened, in, regard, to, the, germanic, kingdom, of, saxony, and, for, the, first, time, allowed, talleyrand, to, participate, in, all, big, four, now, big, five, discussions, with, the, new, consensus, the, major, issues, concerning, poland, and, germany, were, settled, in, the, second, week, of, february, 1815, austria, gained, land, in, the, partition, of, poland, and, prevented, the, prussian, annexation, of, saxony, but, was, forced, to, accept, russian, dominance, in, poland, and, increasing, prussian, influence, in, germany, metternich, now, focused, on, getting, the, various, german, states, to, cede, historic, rights, to, a, new, federal, diet, that, could, stand, up, to, prussia, he, also, assisted, the, swiss, committee, and, worked, on, a, myriad, of, smaller, issues, like, navigation, rights, on, the, rhine, the, beginning, of, lent, on, 8, february, brought, him, more, time, to, devote, to, these, congressional, issues, as, well, as, private, discussions, about, southern, italy, where, joachim, murat, was, said, to, be, raising, a, neapolitan, army, on, 7, march, metternich, was, awakened, with, the, news, that, napoleon, had, escaped, from, his, island, prison, of, elba, and, within, an, hour, had, met, with, both, the, tsar, and, the, king, of, prussia, metternich, wanted, no, rash, change, of, course, and, at, first, there, was, little, impact, on, the, congress, finally, on, 13, march, the, big, five, declared, napoleon, an, outlaw, and, the, allies, began, preparations, for, renewed, fighting, on, 25, march, they, signed, a, treaty, committing, each, to, send, 150, 000, men, with, little, sign, of, their, prior, divisive, stances, after, the, military, commanders, left, the, vienna, congress, settled, down, to, serious, work, fixing, the, boundaries, of, an, independent, netherlands, formalising, proposals, for, a, loose, confederation, of, swiss, cantons, and, ratifying, earlier, agreements, over, poland, by, late, april, only, two, major, issues, remained, the, organisation, of, a, new, german, federation, and, the, problem, of, italy, the, ministers, and, representatives, of, the, german, princes, sent, to, the, congress, continue, to, sing, the, praises, of, prince, metternich, they, admire, the, tact, and, circumspection, with, which, he, has, handled, the, german, committee, the, latter, soon, began, to, come, to, a, head, austria, had, solidified, its, control, over, lombardy, venetia, and, extended, its, protection, to, provinces, nominally, under, the, control, of, francis, daughter, marie, louise, on, 18, april, metternich, announced, that, austria, was, formally, at, war, with, murat, s, naples, austria, won, the, battle, of, tolentino, on, 3, may, and, captured, naples, less, than, three, weeks, later, metternich, then, was, able, to, delay, a, decision, on, the, future, of, the, country, until, after, vienna, discussions, about, germany, would, drag, on, until, early, june, when, a, joint, austrian, prussian, proposition, was, ratified, it, left, most, constitutional, issues, to, the, new, diet, its, president, would, be, emperor, francis, himself, despite, criticism, from, within, austria, metternich, was, pleased, with, the, outcome, and, the, degree, of, control, it, granted, habsburgs, and, through, them, himself, certainly, metternich, was, able, to, use, the, diet, to, his, own, ends, on, numerous, occasions, the, arrangement, was, similarly, popular, with, most, german, representatives, a, summation, treaty, was, signed, on, 19, june, the, russians, signed, a, week, later, bringing, the, vienna, congress, officially, to, an, end, metternich, himself, had, left, on, 13, june, for, the, front, line, prepared, for, a, lengthy, war, against, napoleon, napoleon, however, was, defeated, decisively, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, on, 18, june, from, 1815, onward, statesmen, in, europe, focused, on, averting, the, threat, of, social, revolution, because, napoleon, had, been, defeated, metternich, published, reform, proposals, he, envisaged, the, preservation, of, the, existing, social, hierarchy, and, to, this, end, the, continuous, authority, of, legitimate, sovereigns, as, well, as, the, rule, of, law, metternich, rose, to, become, the, foremost, conservative, statesman, in, europe, his, scrutiny, lasted, until, 1848, the, habsburg, rulers, of, the, austrian, empire, bet, that, the, idea, of, nationality, would, avert, the, doom, metternich, was, back, with, coalition, allies, in, paris, once, more, discussing, peace, terms, after, 133, days, of, negotiations, longer, than, the, hundred, days, turmoil, itself, the, second, treaty, of, paris, was, concluded, on, 20, november, metternich, was, of, the, opinion, that, france, should, not, be, dismembered, he, was, therefore, happy, with, the, result, france, lost, only, a, little, land, along, its, eastern, borders, seven, hundred, million, french, francs, and, the, artworks, it, had, plundered, it, also, accepted, an, army, of, occupation, numbering, 150, 000, in, the, meantime, a, separate, treaty, proposed, by, alexander, and, redrafted, by, metternich, had, been, signed, on, 26, september, this, created, a, new, holy, alliance, centered, on, russia, prussia, and, austria, it, was, a, document, metternich, neither, pushed, for, nor, wanted, given, its, vaguely, liberal, sentiments, representatives, from, most, of, the, european, states, eventually, signed, with, the, exception, of, the, papal, states, the, pope, the, united, kingdom, and, the, ottoman, empire, shortly, afterwards, a, separate, treaty, reaffirmed, the, quadruple, alliance, and, established, through, its, sixth, article, the, congress, system, of, regular, diplomatic, meetings, with, europe, at, peace, the, austrian, flag, now, flew, over, 50, percent, more, land, than, when, metternich, had, become, foreign, minister, metternich, now, returned, to, the, question, of, italy, making, his, first, visit, to, the, country, in, early, december, 1815, after, visiting, venice, his, family, joined, him, in, milan, on, 18, december, for, once, it, was, metternich, playing, the, liberal, vainly, urging, francis, to, give, the, region, some, autonomy, metternich, spent, four, months, in, italy, endlessly, busy, and, suffering, chronic, inflammation, of, the, eyelids, he, tried, to, control, austrian, foreign, policy, from, milan, and, when, there, was, a, serious, disagreement, between, the, empire, and, the, kingdom, of, bavaria, was, heavily, criticised, for, his, absence, his, enemies, could, not, capitalise, on, this, however, stadion, was, occupied, by, his, work, as, finance, minister, and, the, empress, maria, ludovika, of, austria, este, a, fierce, critic, of, metternich, s, policies, died, in, april, the, uncharacteristic, gap, between, the, views, of, metternich, and, his, emperor, was, eased, only, by, the, active, compromise, of, proposals, metternich, returned, to, vienna, on, 28, may, 1816, after, almost, a, year, s, absence, professionally, the, rest, of, 1816, passed, quietly, for, the, tired, minister, who, was, concerned, with, fiscal, policy, and, monitoring, the, spread, of, liberalism, in, germany, and, nationalism, in, italy, personally, he, was, shaken, in, november, by, the, death, of, julie, zichy, festetics, two, years, later, he, wrote, that, his, life, ended, there, and, his, old, frivolity, took, some, time, to, return, the, only, consolation, was, july, s, news, that, metternich, was, to, receive, new, estates, along, the, rhine, at, johannisberg, only, 25, miles, 40, km, from, his, birthplace, at, koblenz, in, june, 1817, metternich, was, required, to, escort, the, emperor, s, newlywed, daughter, maria, leopoldina, to, a, ship, at, livorno, there, was, delay, upon, their, arrival, and, metternich, spent, the, time, travelling, around, italy, again, he, visited, venice, padua, ferrara, pisa, florence, and, lucca, though, alarmed, by, developments, he, noted, that, many, of, francis, concessions, were, still, not, in, practice, but, metternich, was, optimistic, and, made, another, plea, for, decentralisation, on, 29, august, after, this, failed, metternich, decided, to, broaden, his, efforts, into, general, administrative, reform, to, avoid, the, appearance, of, favouring, the, italians, over, the, rest, of, the, empire, while, working, on, this, he, returned, to, vienna, on, 12, september, 1817, to, be, immediately, caught, up, in, the, organisation, of, his, daughter, maria, s, marriage, to, count, joseph, esterh, zy, just, three, days, later, it, proved, too, much, and, metternich, was, taken, ill, after, a, delay, for, recovery, metternich, condensed, his, proposals, for, italy, into, three, documents, he, submitted, to, francis, all, dated, 27, october, 1817, the, administration, would, remain, undemocratic, but, there, would, be, a, new, ministry, of, justice, and, four, new, chancellors, each, with, local, remits, including, one, for, italy, importantly, the, divisions, would, be, regional, not, national, in, the, end, francis, accepted, the, revised, proposals, albeit, with, several, alterations, and, restrictions, metternich, s, primary, focus, remained, on, preserving, unity, among, the, great, powers, of, europe, and, hence, his, own, power, as, mediator, he, was, also, concerned, by, liberal, minded, ioannis, kapodistrias, increasing, influence, over, tsar, alexander, and, the, continual, threat, of, russia, annexing, large, areas, of, the, declining, ottoman, empire, the, so, called, eastern, question, as, he, had, earlier, envisaged, by, april, 1818, britain, had, drawn, up, and, metternich, pushed, through, proposals, to, have, a, congress, at, aachen, then, a, prussian, frontier, town, six, months, later, meanwhile, metternich, was, advised, to, go, to, the, spa, town, of, karlsbad, to, treat, the, rheumatic, tension, in, his, back, it, was, a, pleasant, month, long, trip, although, it, was, there, he, received, news, of, the, death, of, his, father, at, the, age, of, 72, he, visited, the, family, estate, at, k, nigswart, and, then, frankfurt, in, late, august, to, encourage, the, member, states, of, the, german, confederation, to, agree, on, procedural, issues, metternich, could, also, now, visit, koblenz, for, the, first, time, in, 25, years, and, his, new, estate, at, johannisberg, travelling, with, emperor, francis, he, was, warmly, greeted, by, the, catholic, towns, along, the, rhine, as, he, progressed, towards, aachen, he, had, arranged, in, advance, for, newspapers, to, cover, the, first, peacetime, congress, of, its, kind, as, discussions, began, metternich, pushed, for, the, withdrawal, of, allied, troops, from, france, and, means, for, preserving, the, unity, of, the, european, powers, the, former, was, agreed, almost, immediately, but, the, latter, agreement, extended, only, to, maintaining, the, quadruple, alliance, metternich, rejected, the, tsar, s, idealistic, plans, for, among, other, things, a, single, european, army, his, own, recommendations, to, the, prussians, for, greater, controls, on, freedom, of, speech, was, equally, hard, for, other, powers, such, as, britain, to, support, openly, today, the, greatest, evil, and, therefore, the, most, immediate, is, the, press, metternich, travelled, with, dorothea, lieven, to, brussels, soon, after, the, congress, broke, up, and, although, he, could, not, stay, more, than, a, few, days, the, pair, exchanged, letters, for, the, next, eight, years, he, arrived, in, vienna, on, 11, december, 1818, and, was, finally, able, to, spend, considerable, time, with, his, children, he, entertained, the, tsar, during, the, christmas, season, and, spent, twelve, weeks, monitoring, italy, and, germany, before, setting, off, with, the, emperor, on, the, third, trip, to, italy, the, trip, was, cut, short, by, the, assassination, of, the, conservative, german, dramatist, august, von, kotzebue, after, a, short, delay, metternich, decided, that, if, the, german, governments, would, not, act, against, this, perceived, problem, austria, would, have, to, compel, them, he, called, an, informal, conference, in, karlsbad, and, sounded, out, prussian, support, beforehand, by, meeting, with, frederick, william, iii, of, prussia, in, teplice, in, july, metternich, carried, the, day, using, a, recent, attempt, on, the, life, of, the, chief, minister, of, nassau, carl, ibell, to, win, agreement, for, the, conservative, program, now, known, as, the, convention, of, teplitz, the, karlsbad, conference, opened, on, 6, august, and, ran, for, the, rest, of, the, month, metternich, overcame, any, opposition, to, his, proposed, group, of, anti, revolutionary, measures, correct, and, preemptory, although, they, were, condemned, by, outsiders, despite, censure, metternich, was, very, pleased, with, the, result, known, as, the, carlsbad, decrees, at, the, conference, in, vienna, later, in, the, year, metternich, found, himself, constrained, by, the, kings, of, w, rttemberg, and, bavaria, to, abandon, his, plans, to, reform, the, german, confederation, he, now, regretted, having, so, quickly, forced, through, its, original, constitution, five, years, before, nevertheless, he, held, ground, on, other, issues, and, the, conference, s, final, act, was, highly, reactionary, much, as, metternich, had, envisaged, it, he, remained, in, vienna, until, the, close, in, may, 1820, finding, the, whole, affair, a, bore, on, 6, may, he, heard, of, the, death, of, his, daughter, princess, klementine, von, metternich, from, tuberculosis, journeying, on, to, prague, he, heard, that, his, eldest, daughter, maria, had, also, contracted, the, disease, he, was, at, her, bedside, in, baden, bei, wien, when, she, died, on, 20, july, this, prompted, eleonore, and, the, remaining, children, to, leave, for, the, cleaner, air, of, france, the, rest, of, 1820, was, filled, with, liberal, revolts, to, which, metternich, was, expected, to, respond, ultimately, the, austrian, foreign, minister, was, torn, between, following, through, on, his, conservative, pledge, a, policy, favoured, by, the, russians, and, keeping, out, of, a, country, in, which, austria, had, no, interest, favoured, by, the, british, he, chose, sympathetic, inactivity, on, spain, but, much, to, his, dismay, and, surprise, guglielmo, pepe, led, a, revolt, in, naples, in, early, july, and, forced, king, ferdinand, i, to, accept, a, new, constitution, metternich, reluctantly, agreed, to, attend, the, russian, initiated, congress, of, troppau, in, october, to, discuss, these, events, he, need, not, have, worried, the, tsar, gave, way, and, accepted, a, compromise, proposal, of, moderate, interventionism, laid, down, in, the, troppau, protocol, still, worried, by, kapodistrias, influence, over, the, tsar, he, laid, down, his, conservative, principles, in, a, long, memorandum, including, an, attack, on, the, free, press, and, the, initiative, of, the, middle, classes, the, congress, disbanded, in, the, third, week, of, december, and, the, next, step, would, be, a, congress, at, laibach, to, discuss, intervention, with, ferdinand, metternich, found, himself, able, to, dominate, laibach, more, than, any, other, congress, overseeing, ferdinand, s, rejection, of, the, liberal, constitution, he, had, agreed, to, only, months, before, austrian, armies, left, for, naples, in, february, and, entered, the, city, in, march, the, congress, was, adjourned, but, forewarned, or, by, luck, metternich, kept, representatives, of, the, powers, close, at, hand, until, the, revolt, was, put, down, as, a, result, when, similar, revolts, broke, out, in, piedmont, in, the, middle, of, march, metternich, had, the, tsar, at, hand, who, agreed, to, send, 90, 000, men, to, the, frontier, in, a, show, of, solidarity, concerns, grew, in, vienna, that, metternich, s, policy, was, too, expensive, he, responded, that, naples, and, piedmont, would, pay, for, stability, nonetheless, he, too, was, clearly, worried, for, the, future, of, italy, he, was, relieved, when, able, to, create, a, court, chancellor, and, chancellor, of, state, on, 25, may, a, post, left, vacant, since, the, death, of, kaunitz, in, 1794, he, was, also, pleased, at, the, renewed, if, fragile, closeness, between, austria, prussia, and, russia, however, it, had, come, at, the, expense, of, the, anglo, austrian, entente, in, 1821, while, metternich, was, still, at, laibach, with, tsar, alexander, the, revolt, of, prince, alexander, ypsilantis, threatened, to, bring, the, ottoman, empire, to, the, brink, of, collapse, wanting, a, strong, ottoman, empire, to, counterbalance, russia, metternich, opposed, all, forms, of, greek, nationalism, before, alexander, returned, to, russia, metternich, secured, his, agreement, not, to, act, unilaterally, and, would, write, to, the, tsar, again, and, again, asking, him, not, to, intervene, for, extra, support, he, met, with, viscount, castlereagh, now, also, marquess, of, londonderry, and, king, george, iv, of, the, united, kingdom, in, hanover, in, october, the, warmness, of, metternich, s, welcome, was, sweetened, by, his, promise, to, settle, in, part, austria, s, financial, debts, to, britain, the, earlier, anglo, austrian, entente, was, thus, restored, and, the, pair, agreed, that, they, would, support, the, austrian, position, concerning, the, balkans, metternich, went, away, happy, not, least, because, he, had, met, dorothea, lieven, once, more, over, christmas, the, tsar, wavered, more, than, metternich, had, expected, and, sent, dmitry, tatishchev, to, vienna, in, february, 1822, for, talks, with, metternich, metternich, soon, convinced, the, conceited, and, ambitious, russian, to, let, him, dictate, events, in, return, austria, promised, to, support, russia, in, enforcing, its, treaties, with, the, ottomans, if, the, other, alliance, members, would, do, likewise, metternich, was, aware, this, was, politically, impossible, for, the, british, metternich, s, adversary, at, the, russian, court, kapodistrias, retired, from, service, there, however, by, the, end, of, april, there, was, a, new, threat, russia, now, determined, to, intervene, in, spain, action, metternich, described, as, utter, nonsense, he, played, for, time, convincing, his, ally, castlereagh, to, come, to, vienna, for, talks, before, a, scheduled, congress, in, verona, although, castlereagh, died, by, suicide, on, 12, august, with, castlereagh, dead, and, relations, with, the, british, weakening, metternich, had, lost, a, useful, ally, the, congress, of, verona, was, a, fine, social, event, but, diplomatically, less, successful, supposedly, concerned, with, italy, the, congress, had, to, focus, on, spain, instead, austria, urged, non, intervention, but, it, was, the, french, that, carried, the, day, with, their, proposal, for, a, joint, invasion, force, prussia, committed, men, and, the, tsar, pledged, 150, 000, metternich, worried, about, the, difficulties, of, transporting, such, numbers, to, spain, and, about, french, ambitions, but, still, pledged, if, only, moral, support, for, the, joint, force, he, lingered, in, verona, until, 18, december, then, spending, some, days, in, venice, with, the, tsar, and, then, by, himself, in, munich, he, returned, to, vienna, in, early, january, 1823, and, remained, until, september, after, verona, he, travelled, much, less, than, before, partly, because, of, his, new, post, as, chancellor, and, partly, because, of, his, declining, health, he, was, buoyed, by, the, arrival, of, his, family, from, paris, in, may, he, shone, once, more, in, viennese, society, politically, the, year, was, one, of, disappointments, in, march, the, french, crossed, the, pyrenees, unilaterally, undoing, the, moral, solidarity, established, at, verona, likewise, metternich, thought, the, new, pope, leo, xii, too, pro, french, and, there, was, trouble, between, austria, and, several, german, states, over, why, they, had, not, been, included, at, verona, furthermore, metternich, in, discrediting, the, russian, diplomat, pozzo, di, borgo, instead, renewed, the, tsar, s, former, suspicion, of, him, worse, came, in, late, september, while, accompanying, the, emperor, to, a, meeting, with, alexander, at, czernowitz, metternich, fell, ill, with, a, fever, he, could, not, continue, and, had, to, make, do, with, brief, talks, with, the, russian, foreign, minister, karl, nesselrode, at, the, czernowitz, talks, in, metternich, s, absence, an, impatient, tsar, asked, for, a, congress, in, the, then, russian, capital, saint, petersburg, to, discuss, the, eastern, question, metternich, wary, of, letting, the, russians, dominate, affairs, could, only, play, for, time, the, tsar, s, dual, proposal, for, the, st, petersburg, meetings, a, settlement, of, the, eastern, question, favourable, to, russia, and, limited, autonomy, for, three, greek, principalities, was, a, pairing, unpalatable, to, the, other, european, powers, and, potential, attendees, like, british, foreign, secretary, george, canning, slowly, turned, away, much, to, the, annoyance, of, alexander, metternich, believed, for, several, months, afterward, that, he, had, gained, a, unique, level, of, influence, over, the, tsar, meanwhile, he, renewed, the, conservative, program, he, had, outlined, at, karlsbad, five, years, before, and, sought, to, further, increase, austrian, influence, over, the, german, federal, diet, he, also, informed, the, press, they, could, no, longer, publicise, the, minutes, of, diet, meetings, only, its, rulings, in, january, 1825, he, began, to, worry, about, his, wife, eleonore, s, health, and, he, reached, her, sickbed, in, paris, shortly, before, her, death, on, 19, march, mourning, sincerely, for, her, he, also, took, the, opportunity, to, dine, with, the, paris, elite, an, aside, he, made, about, the, tsar, there, was, reported, back, and, did, not, enhance, his, reputation, he, left, paris, for, the, last, time, on, 21, april, and, was, joined, by, the, emperor, in, milan, after, arriving, on, 7, may, he, declined, the, pope, s, invitation, to, become, a, cardinal, of, the, church, there, was, also, a, short, trip, to, genoa, early, in, july, the, court, dispersed, and, metternich, visited, his, daughters, leontine, fourteen, and, hermine, nine, in, the, quiet, town, of, bad, ischl, despite, the, seclusion, he, received, constant, reports, including, those, of, ominous, developments, in, the, ottoman, empire, where, the, greek, revolt, was, rapidly, being, crushed, by, ibrahim, ali, of, egypt, he, also, had, to, deal, with, the, fallout, from, st, petersburg, where, the, tsar, although, unable, to, convene, a, full, congress, had, talked, with, all, the, major, ambassadors, by, mid, may, it, was, clear, the, allies, could, not, decide, on, a, course, of, action, and, as, such, the, holy, alliance, was, no, longer, a, viable, political, entity, in, the, early, 1820s, metternich, had, advised, francis, that, convening, the, hungarian, diet, would, help, get, approval, for, financial, reform, in, fact, the, diet, of, 1825, to, 1827, saw, 300, sessions, filled, with, criticism, of, how, the, empire, had, eroded, the, historic, rights, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, s, nobility, metternich, complained, that, it, interfered, with, time, customs, and, daily, life, as, he, was, forced, to, travel, to, bratislava, to, perform, ceremonial, duties, and, to, observe, he, was, alarmed, by, the, growth, of, hungarian, national, sentiment, and, wary, of, the, growing, influence, of, nationalist, istv, n, sz, chenyi, whom, he, had, met, twice, in, 1825, back, in, vienna, in, mid, december, he, heard, of, the, death, of, tsar, alexander, with, mixed, feelings, he, had, known, the, tsar, well, and, was, reminded, of, his, own, frailty, although, the, death, potentially, wiped, the, soured, diplomatic, slate, clean, moreover, he, could, claim, credit, for, foreseeing, the, liberal, decembrist, revolt, the, new, tsar, nicholas, i, had, to, crush, now, 53, metternich, chose, to, send, archduke, ferdinand, to, establish, the, first, contact, with, nicholas, metternich, was, also, friendly, with, the, british, envoy, the, duke, of, wellington, and, enlisted, his, help, to, charm, nicholas, despite, this, the, first, 18, months, of, nicholas, reign, did, not, go, well, for, metternich, firstly, the, british, were, chosen, over, the, austrians, to, oversee, russian, ottoman, talks, and, as, a, result, metternich, could, exercise, no, influence, over, the, resulting, akkerman, convention, france, too, began, to, drift, away, from, metternich, s, non, interventionist, position, in, august, 1826, russian, foreign, minister, nesselrode, rejected, a, proposal, by, metternich, to, convene, a, congress, to, discuss, the, events, that, eventually, led, to, the, outbreak, of, civil, war, in, portugal, the, austrian, foreign, minister, accepted, this, with, surprising, resilience, on, 29, march, 1827, metternich, spoke, and, attended, the, funeral, of, beethoven, whom, he, may, have, met, during, the, congress, of, vienna, on, 5, november, 1827, baroness, antoinette, von, leykam, daughter, of, diplomat, christoph, ambros, freiherr, von, leykam, 1777, 1830, and, his, wife, donna, lucia, antonia, caputo, dei, marchesi, della, petrella, b, 1783, became, metternich, s, second, wife, she, was, only, twenty, and, their, marriage, a, small, affair, at, hetzendorf, a, village, just, outside, vienna, drew, considerable, criticism, considering, their, difference, in, status, she, belonged, to, the, lower, nobility, but, antoinette, s, grace, and, charm, soon, won, over, viennese, society, the, same, day, british, russian, and, french, forces, destroyed, the, ottoman, fleet, at, the, battle, of, navarino, metternich, worried, that, further, intervention, would, topple, the, ottoman, empire, upsetting, the, balance, so, carefully, created, in, 1815, to, his, relief, the, new, british, prime, minister, wellington, and, his, cabinet, were, equally, fearful, of, giving, russia, the, upper, hand, in, the, balkans, after, another, round, of, his, proposals, for, congresses, was, rejected, metternich, stood, back, from, the, eastern, question, watching, as, the, treaty, of, adrianople, was, signed, in, september, 1829, though, he, publicly, criticised, it, for, being, too, harsh, on, turkey, privately, he, was, satisfied, with, its, leniency, and, promise, of, greek, autonomy, making, it, a, buffer, against, russian, expansion, rather, than, a, russian, satellite, state, metternich, s, private, life, was, filled, with, grief, in, november, 1828, his, mother, died, and, in, january, 1829, antoinette, died, five, days, after, giving, birth, to, their, son, richard, von, metternich, after, fighting, tuberculosis, for, many, months, metternich, s, son, viktor, then, a, junior, diplomat, died, on, 30, november, 1829, consequently, he, spent, christmas, alone, and, depressed, worried, by, the, draconian, methods, of, some, of, his, fellow, conservatives, and, by, the, renewed, march, of, liberalism, my, whole, life, s, work, is, destroyed, in, may, metternich, took, a, much, needed, holiday, on, his, estate, at, johannisberg, he, returned, to, vienna, a, month, later, still, worried, by, the, chaos, in, london, and, paris, and, his, declining, ability, to, prevent, it, hearing, nesselrode, was, due, to, take, the, waters, at, karlsbad, he, met, him, there, in, late, july, he, berated, the, quiet, nesselrode, but, no, offence, was, taken, the, two, arranged, a, second, meeting, in, august, in, the, interim, metternich, heard, of, france, s, july, revolution, which, deeply, shocked, him, and, theoretically, posed, the, need, for, a, congress, of, the, quadruple, alliance, instead, metternich, met, with, nesselrode, as, planned, and, while, the, russian, rejected, his, plan, to, restore, the, old, alliance, the, pair, agreed, on, the, chiffon, de, karlsbad, that, panic, was, needless, unless, the, new, government, showed, territorial, ambitions, in, europe, although, pleased, by, this, metternich, s, mood, was, soured, by, news, of, unrest, in, brussels, then, part, of, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, the, resignation, of, wellington, in, london, and, calls, for, constitutionality, in, germany, he, wrote, with, sombre, and, almost, morbid, relish, that, it, was, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, old, europe, nonetheless, he, was, heartened, by, the, fact, that, the, july, revolution, had, made, a, franco, russian, alliance, impossible, and, that, the, netherlands, had, called, an, old, style, congress, of, the, sort, he, enjoyed, so, much, the, 1830, convocation, of, the, hungarian, diet, was, also, more, successful, than, past, ones, crowning, archduke, ferdinand, as, king, of, hungary, with, little, dissent, moreover, by, november, his, betrothal, to, 25, year, old, countess, melanie, zichy, ferraris, who, came, from, a, magyar, family, the, metternichs, had, long, known, was, agreed, upon, the, announcement, caused, far, less, consternation, in, vienna, than, metternich, s, previous, bride, and, they, were, married, on, 30, january, 1831, in, february, 1831, rebels, took, the, cities, of, parma, modena, and, bologna, and, appealed, to, france, for, help, their, former, rulers, appealed, for, help, from, austria, but, metternich, was, anxious, not, to, march, austrian, troops, into, the, papal, states, without, authorisation, from, the, new, pope, gregory, xvi, he, occupied, parma, and, modena, however, both, ruled, by, habsburgs, and, eventually, did, cross, into, papal, territory, as, a, result, italy, was, pacified, by, the, end, of, march, he, authorised, troop, withdrawal, from, the, papal, states, in, july, but, by, january, 1832, they, were, back, to, put, down, a, second, rebellion, by, now, metternich, was, ageing, noticeably, his, hair, was, grey, and, his, face, drawn, and, sunken, although, his, wife, still, enjoyed, his, company, in, february, 1832, a, daughter, also, melanie, was, born, in, 1833, a, son, klemens, though, he, died, aged, two, months, in, october, 1834, a, second, son, paul, and, in, 1837, his, third, with, melanie, lothar, politically, metternich, had, a, new, adversary, lord, palmerston, who, had, taken, over, at, the, british, foreign, office, in, 1830, by, the, end, of, 1832, they, had, clashed, on, virtually, every, issue, in, short, metternich, wrote, palmerston, is, wrong, about, everything, mostly, metternich, was, annoyed, by, his, insistence, that, under, the, 1815, agreements, britain, had, the, right, to, oppose, austria, s, tightening, of, university, controls, in, germany, as, metternich, had, done, again, in, 1832, metternich, also, worried, that, if, future, congresses, were, held, in, britain, as, palmerston, wanted, his, own, influence, would, be, significantly, reduced, in, 1831, egypt, invaded, the, ottoman, empire, there, were, fears, of, the, empire, s, total, collapse, by, which, austria, stood, to, gain, little, metternich, therefore, proposed, multilateral, support, for, the, ottomans, and, a, viennese, congress, to, sort, out, details, but, the, french, were, evasive, and, the, british, refused, to, support, any, congress, held, in, vienna, by, the, summer, of, 1833, anglo, austrian, relations, had, hit, a, new, low, with, russia, metternich, was, more, confident, of, exerting, influence, he, was, mistaken, however, and, left, to, observe, from, afar, russian, intervention, in, the, region, culminating, in, the, treaty, of, h, nk, r, skelesi, he, still, arranged, to, meet, with, king, frederick, william, iii, of, prussia, at, teplitz, and, accompany, francis, to, meet, tsar, nicholas, at, m, nchengr, tz, in, september, 1833, the, former, meeting, went, well, metternich, still, felt, able, to, dominate, the, prussians, despite, their, rising, economic, prominence, in, europe, through, the, zollverein, the, latter, was, more, strained, but, as, nicholas, warmed, three, m, nchengr, tz, agreements, were, reached, that, shaped, a, new, conservative, league, to, uphold, the, existing, order, in, turkey, poland, and, elsewhere, metternich, left, happy, his, sole, disappointment, was, having, to, commit, to, being, tougher, on, polish, nationalists, almost, immediately, he, heard, of, the, creation, of, the, quadruple, alliance, of, 1834, between, britain, france, spain, and, portugal, this, alliance, of, liberals, was, such, an, affront, to, austrian, values, that, palmerston, wrote, he, should, like, to, see, metternich, s, face, when, he, reads, our, treaty, it, did, indeed, draw, bitter, condemnation, mostly, because, it, provided, the, occasion, for, an, outbreak, of, war, metternich, tried, two, tacks, to, intrigue, for, the, removal, of, the, british, foreign, secretary, and, to, attempt, vainly, to, build, up, cross, power, bloc, agreements, palmerston, did, indeed, leave, office, in, november, but, only, temporarily, and, not, by, any, of, metternich, s, attempts, large, scale, war, however, had, been, avoided, and, the, quadruple, alliance, was, beginning, to, disintegrate, on, 2, march, 1835, emperor, francis, died, succeeded, by, his, epileptic, son, ferdinand, i, despite, the, widespread, opinion, that, ferdinand, was, a, ghost, of, a, monarch, metternich, valued, legitimacy, highly, and, worked, to, keep, the, government, running, he, soon, accompanied, ferdinand, on, his, first, meeting, with, tsar, nicholas, and, the, king, of, prussia, again, at, teplitz, ferdinand, was, overwhelmed, especially, as, the, delegations, paraded, into, prague, overall, however, it, was, an, untroubled, meeting, the, next, few, years, passed, relatively, peacefully, for, metternich, diplomatic, incident, was, limited, to, the, occasional, angry, exchange, with, palmerston, and, metternich, s, failure, to, be, a, mediator, between, the, british, and, russians, over, their, black, sea, dispute, he, also, put, effort, into, bringing, new, technology, like, the, railways, into, austria, the, most, pressing, issue, was, hungary, where, metternich, remained, reluctant, to, support, the, centrist, but, still, nationalist, sz, chenyi, his, hesitancy, is, a, sad, commentary, on, his, declining, powers, of, political, presence, at, court, metternich, increasingly, lost, power, to, the, rising, star, franz, anton, von, kolowrat, liebsteinsky, particularly, in, his, proposals, to, increase, military, budgets, after, his, failed, attempt, in, 1836, to, force, constitutional, reform, which, would, have, afforded, him, greater, influence, largely, thwarted, by, the, more, liberally, minded, archduke, john, metternich, was, forced, to, share, more, power, with, kolowrat, and, archduke, ludwig, as, part, of, austria, s, secret, state, conference, decision, making, ground, to, a, halt, entertaining, and, maintaining, his, estates, at, johannisberg, k, nigswart, and, plasy, together, with, mari, nsk, t, nice, were, consuming, much, of, his, resources, at, a, time, when, he, had, four, young, children, to, support, causing, him, more, stress, metternich, had, long, predicted, a, new, crisis, in, the, east, and, when, the, egyptian, ottoman, war, broke, out, in, 1839, he, was, anxious, to, re, establish, austria, s, diplomatic, credentials, he, quickly, gathered, representatives, in, vienna, whence, on, 27, july, they, issued, a, communiqu, to, istanbul, pledging, support, however, tsar, nicholas, sent, metternich, a, message, from, st, petersburg, challenging, vienna, s, claim, to, diplomatic, centrality, metternich, worked, so, furiously, that, he, fell, ill, spending, the, next, five, weeks, resting, at, johannisberg, the, austrians, lost, the, initiative, and, metternich, had, to, accept, that, london, would, be, the, new, centre, of, negotiations, over, the, eastern, question, just, three, weeks, after, its, creation, metternich, s, european, league, of, great, powers, his, diplomatic, response, to, aggressive, moves, by, french, prime, minister, adolphe, thiers, had, become, a, mere, curiosity, little, too, was, heard, of, his, proposals, to, hold, a, congress, in, germany, a, separate, attempt, to, strengthen, the, influence, of, ambassadors, stationed, in, vienna, was, also, rejected, this, set, the, tone, for, the, rest, of, metternich, s, chancellorship, his, illness, had, it, seemed, to, others, broken, his, love, of, being, in, office, over, the, next, decade, his, wife, prepared, quietly, for, his, retirement, or, death, in, office, metternich, s, work, during, the, early, 1840s, was, dominated, again, by, hungary, and, more, generally, questions, of, national, identity, within, the, diverse, austrian, empire, here, metternich, showed, acute, perception, his, hungarian, proposals, came, far, too, late, however, as, lajos, kossuth, had, already, led, the, rise, of, strong, hungarian, nationalism, metternich, s, support, for, other, nationalities, was, patchy, since, he, only, opposed, those, that, threatened, the, unity, of, the, empire, at, the, conference, of, state, metternich, lost, his, principal, ally, count, karl, von, clam, martinic, in, 1840, which, furthered, the, growing, paralysis, at, the, heart, of, austrian, government, metternich, now, struggled, to, enforce, even, the, level, of, censorship, he, desired, there, were, no, major, challenges, to, the, regime, from, outside, italy, was, quiet, and, neither, metternich, s, attempt, to, lecture, the, new, prussian, king, frederick, william, iv, nor, the, boredom, of, the, new, british, queen, victoria, at, their, first, meeting, posed, immediate, problems, far, more, worrying, was, tsar, nicholas, whose, estimation, of, the, habsburg, dynasty, and, austria, was, low, after, an, impromptu, tour, of, italy, in, 1845, the, tsar, unexpectedly, stopped, in, vienna, already, in, a, bad, mood, he, was, an, awkward, guest, though, in, between, criticisms, of, austria, he, reassured, metternich, that, russia, was, not, about, to, invade, the, ottoman, empire, again, two, months, later, their, countries, were, required, to, work, together, over, the, galician, slaughter, and, a, declaration, of, independence, by, the, free, city, of, cracow, metternich, authorised, the, occupation, of, the, city, and, the, use, of, troops, to, restore, order, in, surrounding, areas, intent, on, undoing, the, pseudo, independence, that, had, been, granted, krak, w, in, 1815, after, months, of, negotiations, with, prussia, and, russia, austria, annexed, the, city, in, november, 1846, metternich, regarded, it, as, a, personal, victory, but, it, was, an, act, of, dubious, utility, not, only, were, polish, dissidents, now, officially, part, of, austria, the, europe, wide, polish, dissident, movement, was, now, worked, actively, against, the, metternich, system, that, had, overridden, the, rights, enshrined, in, 1815, britain, and, france, appeared, similarly, outraged, although, calls, for, metternich, s, resignation, were, ignored, for, the, next, two, years, ferdinand, could, not, abdicate, in, favour, of, his, nephew, without, a, regency, metternich, believed, austria, would, need, him, in, the, interim, to, hold, the, government, together, though, metternich, was, tiring, memoranda, kept, pouring, forth, from, his, chancellery, despite, this, he, did, not, foresee, the, building, crisis, the, new, pope, pius, ix, was, gaining, a, reputation, as, a, liberal, nationalist, counterbalancing, metternich, and, austria, at, the, same, time, the, empire, experienced, unemployment, and, rising, prices, as, a, result, of, poor, harvests, metternich, was, bemused, at, the, outcry, from, italians, the, pope, and, palmerston, when, he, ordered, the, occupation, of, papal, controlled, ferrara, in, the, summer, of, 1847, despite, securing, french, agreement, for, the, first, time, in, years, from, fran, ois, guizot, over, the, swiss, civil, war, france, and, austria, were, forced, into, backing, breakaway, cantons, the, pair, proposed, a, conference, but, the, government, crushed, the, revolt, it, was, a, major, blow, to, metternich, s, prestige, and, his, opponents, in, vienna, called, it, evidence, of, his, incompetence, in, january, 1848, metternich, predicted, trouble, in, italy, during, the, year, ahead, he, acted, on, this, by, dispatching, an, envoy, karl, ludwig, von, ficquelmont, to, italy, by, resurrecting, his, 1817, plans, for, an, italian, chancellery, and, by, arranging, various, contingency, plans, with, the, french, in, late, february, austrian, field, marshal, joseph, radetsky, placed, austrian, italy, lombardy, venetia, under, martial, law, as, disturbances, spread, despite, this, and, hearing, of, renewed, revolution, in, france, metternich, was, cautious, still, thinking, domestic, revolution, unlikely, he, was, described, by, a, saxon, diplomat, as, in, the, words, of, biographer, musulin, having, shrunk, to, a, shadow, of, his, former, self, i, am, no, longer, anybody, i, have, nothing, more, to, do, nothing, more, to, discuss, on, 3, march, kossuth, gave, a, fiery, speech, in, the, hungarian, diet, calling, for, a, constitution, it, was, not, until, 10, march, that, metternich, appeared, concerned, about, events, in, vienna, where, there, were, now, threats, and, counter, threats, flying, two, petitions, were, organised, calling, for, greater, freedom, transparency, and, representation, students, were, involved, in, several, demonstrations, culminating, on, 13, march, when, they, cheered, the, imperial, family, but, voiced, anger, at, metternich, after, a, customary, morning, metternich, was, called, to, meet, with, archduke, ludwig, soon, after, midday, the, chancellor, had, troops, sent, into, the, streets, while, also, announcing, a, prearranged, and, minimal, concession, in, the, afternoon, the, crowd, turned, hostile, and, a, division, of, troops, opened, fire, on, it, killing, five, the, mob, was, now, truly, incited, as, the, liberals, were, joined, by, underprivileged, viennese, set, on, wreaking, havoc, the, students, offered, to, form, a, pro, government, academic, legion, if, their, demands, were, met, ludwig, was, eager, to, accept, and, told, metternich, he, must, resign, to, which, he, reluctantly, agreed, after, sleeping, in, the, chancellery, he, was, advised, to, either, take, back, his, resignation, or, leave, the, city, after, ludwig, sent, him, a, message, to, the, effect, that, the, government, could, not, guarantee, his, safety, metternich, left, for, the, house, of, count, taaffe, and, then, with, aid, from, friends, charles, von, h, gel, and, johann, rechberg, reached, the, family, seat, of, prince, liechtenstein, forty, miles, away, at, feldsberg, metternich, s, daughter, leontine, joined, them, on, 21, march, and, suggested, england, as, a, haven, agreeing, metternich, melanie, and, 19, year, old, richard, set, out, leaving, the, younger, children, with, leontine, metternich, s, resignation, had, been, met, with, cheering, in, vienna, and, even, the, viennese, commoners, welcomed, the, end, of, metternich, s, era, of, social, conservatism, after, an, anxious, journey, of, nine, days, during, which, they, were, honoured, in, some, towns, and, refused, entry, to, others, metternich, his, wife, and, son, richard, arrived, in, the, dutch, city, of, arnhem, they, stayed, until, metternich, regained, his, strength, then, reached, amsterdam, and, the, hague, where, they, waited, to, hear, the, results, of, a, demonstration, by, english, chartists, planned, for, 10, april, on, 20, april, they, landed, at, blackwall, in, london, where, they, stayed, in, the, brunswick, hotel, in, hanover, square, for, a, fortnight, until, they, found, a, permanent, residence, metternich, largely, enjoyed, his, time, in, london, the, duke, of, wellington, now, nearly, eighty, tried, to, keep, him, entertained, and, there, were, also, visits, from, palmerston, guizot, now, also, in, exile, and, benjamin, disraeli, who, enjoyed, his, political, conversation, the, sole, disappointment, was, that, victoria, herself, did, not, acknowledge, his, presence, in, the, capital, the, trio, leased, a, house, 44, eaton, square, for, four, months, the, younger, children, joined, them, in, the, summer, he, followed, events, in, austria, from, afar, famously, denying, ever, having, erred, in, fact, he, declared, the, turmoil, in, europe, to, be, a, vindication, of, his, policies, in, vienna, a, hostile, post, censorship, press, continued, to, attack, him, in, particular, they, accused, him, of, embezzlement, and, accepting, bribes, prompting, an, investigation, metternich, was, eventually, cleared, of, the, more, extreme, charges, and, searches, for, evidence, of, the, lesser, ones, came, up, empty, handed, in, all, likelihood, metternich, s, large, expense, claims, were, merely, a, product, of, the, necessities, of, early, 19th, century, diplomacy, meanwhile, as, he, was, denied, his, pension, metternich, was, ironically, reliant, on, loans, in, mid, september, the, family, moved, to, 42, brunswick, terrace, brighton, on, the, south, coast, of, england, where, the, tranquillity, of, life, contrasted, greatly, with, revolutionary, europe, left, behind, parliamentary, figures, particularly, disraeli, travelled, down, to, visit, them, as, did, metternich, s, former, friend, dorothea, lieven, melanie, led, a, reconciliation, between, the, two, expecting, a, visit, from, metternich, s, daughter, leontine, and, her, own, daughter, pauline, the, family, moved, to, a, suite, of, rooms, at, richmond, palace, on, 23, april, 1849, visitors, included, wellington, who, still, watched, out, for, metternich, johann, strauss, the, composer, and, dorothea, de, dino, sister, of, metternich, s, former, lover, wilhemine, of, sagan, and, former, lover, catherine, bagration, metternich, was, showing, his, age, and, his, frequent, fainting, was, cause, for, worry, the, ex, chancellor, was, also, depressed, by, the, lack, of, communication, from, the, new, emperor, franz, joseph, i, and, his, government, leontine, wrote, to, vienna, trying, to, encourage, this, contact, and, in, august, metternich, received, a, warm, letter, from, franz, joseph, sincere, or, not, it, buoyed, metternich, considerably, from, mid, august, melanie, began, to, push, for, a, move, to, brussels, a, city, cheaper, to, live, in, and, closer, to, continental, affairs, they, arrived, in, october, staying, overnight, in, the, hotel, bellevue, with, revolution, subsiding, metternich, was, hopeful, they, would, return, to, vienna, their, stay, in, fact, lasted, over, 18, months, while, metternich, waited, for, an, opportunity, to, re, enter, austrian, politics, it, was, a, pleasant, enough, and, cheap, stay, first, in, the, boulevard, de, l, observatoire, and, later, in, the, sablon, area, filled, with, visits, from, politicians, writers, musicians, and, scientists, for, metternich, however, the, tedium, and, homesickness, only, increased, in, march, 1851, melanie, induced, him, to, write, to, the, new, political, force, in, vienna, prince, schwarzenberg, to, ask, if, he, might, return, if, he, promised, not, to, interfere, in, public, affairs, in, april, he, received, an, affirmative, reply, authorised, by, franz, joseph, in, may, 1851, metternich, left, for, his, johannisberg, estate, which, he, had, last, visited, in, 1845, that, summer, metternich, enjoyed, the, company, of, prussian, representative, otto, von, bismarck, he, also, enjoyed, a, visit, from, frederick, william, iv, though, the, king, irritated, metternich, by, appearing, to, cultivate, him, as, a, tool, against, schwarzenberg, in, september, metternich, returned, to, vienna, entertained, along, the, way, by, various, german, princes, keen, to, entertain, the, focus, of, prussian, intrigue, metternich, was, reinvigorated, dropped, his, nostalgia, and, lived, in, the, present, for, the, first, time, in, a, decade, franz, josef, asked, for, his, advice, on, numerous, issues, though, he, was, too, headstrong, to, be, much, influenced, by, it, and, both, of, the, two, emerging, factions, in, vienna, courted, metternich, even, tsar, nicholas, called, on, him, during, a, state, visit, metternich, was, not, keen, on, the, new, foreign, minister, karl, ferdinand, von, buol, but, thought, him, sufficiently, incompetent, that, he, would, be, impressionable, metternich, s, advice, was, of, varying, quality, nonetheless, some, of, it, was, usefully, insightful, even, in, modern, issues, now, deaf, metternich, wrote, endlessly, particularly, for, an, appreciative, franz, josef, he, wanted, austrian, neutrality, in, the, crimean, war, though, buol, did, not, in, the, meantime, metternich, s, health, was, slowly, failing, and, he, was, a, more, peripheral, figure, after, the, death, of, his, wife, melanie, in, january, 1854, in, a, brief, resurgence, of, energy, in, early, 1856, he, busied, himself, in, arrangements, for, a, marriage, between, his, son, richard, and, his, granddaughter, pauline, richard, s, step, sister, s, daughter, and, undertook, more, travel, the, king, of, the, belgians, came, to, visit, as, did, bismarck, and, on, 16, august, 1857, he, entertained, the, future, edward, vii, of, the, united, kingdom, buol, however, was, growing, more, resentful, of, metternich, s, advice, particularly, about, italy, in, april, 1859, franz, josef, came, to, ask, him, about, what, should, be, done, in, italy, according, to, pauline, metternich, begged, him, not, to, send, an, ultimatum, to, italy, and, franz, josef, explained, that, such, an, ultimatum, had, already, been, sent, in, this, way, much, to, metternich, s, disappointment, and, to, franz, josef, s, embarrassment, austria, began, the, second, italian, war, of, independence, against, the, combined, forces, of, piedmont, sardinia, and, its, ally, france, though, metternich, was, able, to, secure, the, replacement, of, buol, with, his, friend, rechberg, who, had, helped, him, so, much, in, 1848, involvement, in, the, war, itself, was, now, beyond, his, capacity, even, a, special, task, given, to, him, by, franz, josef, in, june, 1859, to, draw, up, secret, papers, addressing, the, event, of, franz, josef, s, death, was, now, too, taxing, shortly, afterwards, metternich, died, in, vienna, on, 11, june, 1859, aged, 86, and, the, last, great, figure, of, his, generation, almost, everyone, of, note, in, vienna, came, to, pay, tribute, in, the, foreign, press, his, death, went, virtually, unnoticed, defunct, historians, agree, on, metternich, s, skill, as, a, diplomat, and, his, dedication, to, conservatism, according, to, arthur, may, he, believed, that, the, mass, of, europeans, yearned, for, security, quiet, and, peace, and, regarded, liberal, abstractions, as, repugnant, or, were, utterly, indifferent, to, them, the, best, of, all, patterns, of, government, he, insisted, was, autocratic, absolutism, upheld, by, a, loyal, army, by, a, submissive, decently, efficient, bureaucracy, and, police, machine, and, by, trustworthy, churchmen, particularly, during, the, remainder, of, the, nineteenth, century, metternich, was, heavily, criticised, decried, as, the, man, who, prevented, austria, and, the, rest, of, central, europe, from, developing, along, normal, liberal, and, constitutional, lines, had, metternich, not, stood, in, the, way, of, progress, austria, might, have, reformed, dealt, better, with, its, problems, of, nationality, and, the, first, world, war, might, never, have, happened, instead, metternich, chose, to, fight, an, overwhelmingly, fruitless, war, against, the, forces, of, liberalism, and, nationalism, heavy, censorship, was, just, one, of, a, range, of, repressive, instruments, of, state, available, to, him, that, also, included, a, large, spy, network, metternich, opposed, electoral, reform, criticising, britain, s, 1832, reform, bill, in, short, he, locked, himself, into, an, embittered, battle, against, the, prevailing, mood, of, his, age, on, the, other, hand, metternich, s, diplomacy, and, statesmanship, became, the, focus, of, praise, in, the, twentieth, century, from, more, favourably, inclined, historians, particularly, biographer, heinrich, von, srbik, for, example, particularly, after, wwii, historians, were, more, likely, to, defend, metternich, s, policies, as, reasonable, attempts, to, achieve, his, goals, chiefly, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, sympathetic, historians, point, out, that, metternich, correctly, foresaw, and, worked, to, prevent, russian, dominance, in, europe, succeeding, where, his, successors, would, fail, 130, years, later, as, argued, by, srbik, metternich, himself, pursued, legality, cooperation, and, dialogue, and, therefore, helped, ensure, thirty, years, of, peace, the, age, of, metternich, authors, like, peter, viereck, and, ernst, b, haas, also, give, metternich, credit, for, his, more, liberal, ideals, even, if, they, weighed, relatively, little, in, his, overall, policies, critical, views, presuppose, metternich, had, the, ability, to, shape, europe, favorably, but, chose, not, to, more, modern, critiques, like, that, of, a, j, p, taylor, have, questioned, how, much, influence, metternich, actually, wielded, robin, okey, a, critic, of, metternich, noted, that, even, in, the, realm, of, foreign, affairs, metternich, had, only, his, own, persuasiveness, to, rely, on, and, this, degraded, over, time, by, this, interpretation, his, task, was, to, create, a, smokescreen, that, hid, austria, s, true, weakness, when, it, came, to, choosing, a, set, of, sound, principles, wrote, taylor, most, men, could, do, better, while, shaving, the, result, was, that, metternich, was, no, captivating, diplomat, taylor, described, him, as, the, most, boring, man, in, european, history, not, only, were, his, failures, limited, to, foreign, affairs, critics, argue, at, home, he, was, equally, powerless, failing, to, effect, even, his, own, proposals, for, administrative, reform, in, contrast, those, who, have, attempted, to, rehabilitate, metternich, describe, him, as, unquestionably, master, of, diplomacy, someone, who, perfected, and, indeed, shaped, the, nature, of, diplomacy, in, his, era, in, a, similar, vein, alan, sked, argues, that, metternich, s, smokescreen, may, well, have, served, a, purpose, in, furthering, a, relatively, coherent, set, of, principles, metternich, s, children, grandchildren, and, great, grandchildren, are, names, are,
