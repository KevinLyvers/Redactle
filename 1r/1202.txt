eroded, the, power, of, the, king, with, many, ndongan, noblemen, sobas, refusing, to, pay, tribute, to, the, crown, and, some, siding, with, the, portuguese, by, the, time, that, nzingha, s, father, became, king, in, 1593, the, region, had, been, devastated, by, war, and, the, power, of, the, king, greatly, diminished, the, king, tried, a, variety, of, methods, to, handle, the, crisis, including,

singled, out, for, harsh, treatment, as, she, had, a, longstanding, rivalry, with, her, brother, perhaps, fearing, for, her, life, nzinga, fled, to, the, kingdom, of, matamba, having, consolidated, his, power, mbandi, vowed, to, continue, the, war, against, the, portuguese, however, he, lacked, military, skill, and, while, he, was, able, to, form, an, alliance, with, the, imbangala, the, portuguese, made, significant, military, gains, faced, with, the, portuguese, threat, in, 1621, he, contacted, nzingha, asking, her, to, be, his, emissary, to, the, portuguese, in, luanda, she, was, the, best, fit, for, the, job, as, she, was, both, of, royal, lineage, and, spoke, fluent, portuguese, she, agreed, to, lead, the, diplomatic, mission, with, the, stipulation, that, she, be, granted, the, authority, to, negotiate, in, the, king, s, name, and, permission, to, be, baptized, an, important, diplomatic, tool, she, hoped, to, use, against, the, portuguese, nzingha, departed, the, ndongan, capital, with, a, large, retinue, and, was, received, with, considerable, interest, in, luanda, compelling, the, portuguese, governor, to, pay, for, all, of, her, party, s, expenses, while, ndongo, leaders, typically, met, the, portuguese, in, european, clothing, she, chose, to, wear, opulent, traditional, clothing, including, feathers, and, jewels, of, the, ndongan, people, to, display, that, their, culture, was, not, inferior, according, to, a, popular, story, when, nzingha, arrived, to, meet, with, the, portuguese, there, were, chairs, for, the, portuguese, officials, but, only, a, mat, provided, for, her, this, type, of, behavior, from, the, portuguese, was, common, it, was, their, way, of, displaying, a, subordinate, status, a, status, reserved, for, conquered, africans, in, response, to, this, nzingha, s, attendant, formed, himself, to, be, her, chair, while, she, spoke, to, the, governor, face, to, face, she, employed, flattery, as, a, diplomatic, tool, and, according, to, some, sources, deliberately, chose, to, contrast, her, brother, s, belligerent, style, with, her, own, diplomatic, decorum, as, ambassador, nzingha, s, main, goal, was, to, secure, peace, between, her, people, and, the, portuguese, to, this, end, she, promised, the, portuguese, an, end, to, hostilities, describing, her, brother, s, previous, actions, as, the, mistakes, of, a, young, king, allowed, portuguese, slave, traders, inside, ndongo, and, offered, to, return, escaped, portuguese, slaves, fighting, in, her, brother, s, army, in, return, she, demanded, that, portugal, remove, the, forts, built, inside, ndongan, territory, and, was, adamant, that, ndongo, would, not, pay, tribute, to, portugal, noting, that, only, conquered, peoples, paid, tribute, and, her, people, had, not, been, defeated, she, also, expressed, a, desire, for, cooperation, between, the, two, kingdoms, noting, that, they, could, support, each, other, against, their, common, enemies, in, the, region, when, the, portuguese, questioned, her, commitment, to, peace, nzingha, offered, to, be, publicly, baptized, which, she, was, with, great, aplomb, in, luanda, she, adopted, the, name, dona, anna, de, sousa, in, honor, of, her, godparents, ana, da, silva, the, governor, s, wife, and, her, ordained, godmother, and, governor, joao, correia, de, sousa, a, peace, treaty, was, subsequently, agreed, upon, and, nzingha, returned, to, kabasa, in, triumph, in, late, 1622, despite, her, success, in, the, negotiations, with, the, portuguese, the, peace, between, ndongo, and, the, imbangala, themselves, engaged, in, expanding, their, territory, collapsed, after, a, series, of, defeats, the, ndongan, royal, family, was, driven, out, of, their, court, in, kabasa, putting, the, king, in, exile, and, allowing, for, some, of, the, imbangala, to, establish, the, kingdom, of, kasanje, the, portuguese, governor, wanted, to, proceed, with, the, treaty, but, refused, to, aid, ndongo, against, the, imbangala, until, the, king, had, recaptured, kabasa, and, been, baptized, king, mbandi, retook, kabasa, in, 1623, and, took, tentative, steps, towards, christianity, but, remained, deeply, distrustful, of, the, portuguese, an, increasingly, powerful, figure, in, the, royal, court, nzingha, in, a, possible, political, ploy, warned, her, brother, that, a, baptism, would, offend, his, traditionalist, supporters, convincing, him, to, reject, any, idea, of, being, baptized, in, addition, the, portuguese, began, reneging, on, the, treaty, refusing, to, withdraw, from, their, fortresses, inside, ndongo, and, conducting, raids, for, loot, and, slaves, into, ndongo, s, territory, by, 1624, king, mbandi, had, fallen, into, a, deep, depression, and, was, forced, to, cede, many, of, his, duties, to, nzingha, in, 1624, her, brother, died, of, mysterious, causes, some, say, suicide, others, say, poisoning, before, his, death, he, had, made, it, clear, that, nzinga, should, be, his, successor, nzinga, quickly, moved, to, consolidate, her, rule, having, her, supporters, seize, the, ritual, objects, associated, with, the, monarchy, and, eliminating, her, opponents, at, court, she, also, assumed, the, title, of, ngola, conferring, a, position, of, great, influence, among, her, people, an, opulent, funeral, for, her, brother, was, arranged, and, some, of, his, remains, were, preserved, in, a, misete, a, reliquary, so, they, could, later, be, consulted, by, nzinga, one, major, obstacle, to, her, rule, her, 7, year, old, nephew, was, under, the, guardianship, of, kasa, an, imbangala, war, chief, to, remove, this, potential, pretender, to, her, throne, nzinga, approached, kasa, with, a, marriage, proposal, the, couple, were, married, and, after, the, wedding, she, had, her, nephew, killed, in, nzinga, s, view, final, revenge, for, her, own, murdered, son, however, her, ascension, to, the, throne, faced, severe, opposition, from, male, claimants, from, other, noble, families, according, to, mbande, tradition, neither, nzinga, nor, her, predecessor, brother, had, a, direct, right, to, the, throne, because, they, were, children, of, slave, wives, not, the, first, wife, nzinga, countered, this, argument, strategically, using, the, claim, that, she, was, properly, descended, from, the, main, royal, line, through, her, father, as, opposed, to, her, rivals, had, no, bloodline, connection, her, opponents, on, the, other, hand, used, other, precedents, to, discredit, her, such, as, that, she, was, a, female, and, thus, ineligible, in, addition, nzinga, s, willingness, to, negotiate, with, the, portuguese, as, opposed, to, previous, rulers, who, had, fought, against, them, was, seen, as, a, sign, of, weakness, by, some, of, the, ndongan, nobility, specifically, the, treaty, s, allowing, of, portuguese, missionaries, inside, ndongo, was, seen, with, distaste, while, the, succession, crisis, deepened, relations, between, ndongo, and, portugal, became, more, complex, nzinga, hoped, to, fulfill, the, treaty, she, had, signed, with, the, portuguese, in, 1621, and, thereby, regain, ndongan, lands, lost, during, her, brother, s, disastrous, wars, governor, de, sousa, was, also, keen, to, avoid, conflict, and, both, he, and, nzinga, were, eager, to, re, open, the, slave, trade, that, was, so, vital, to, the, region, s, economy, however, tensions, rose, between, nzinga, and, de, sousa, when, nzinga, asked, for, the, return, of, kijikos, a, servile, caste, of, slaves, traditionally, owned, by, the, ndongan, royalty, living, in, portuguese, controlled, territory, as, had, been, agreed, in, the, treaty, de, sousa, refused, and, demanded, that, nzinga, return, escaped, portuguese, slaves, serving, in, her, army, first, de, sousa, also, demanded, that, nzinga, become, a, vassal, of, the, king, of, portugal, and, pay, tribute, demands, she, refused, outright, further, straining, relations, in, late, 1624, de, sousa, began, an, aggressive, campaign, to, force, mbande, nobles, sobas, to, become, portuguese, vassals, sobas, were, traditionally, vassals, of, the, ruler, of, ndongo, and, provided, as, tribute, the, valuable, provisions, soldiers, and, slaves, needed, to, control, angola, thus, by, making, the, sobas, vassals, of, portugal, the, portuguese, were, able, to, undermine, nzinga, s, position, as, queen, of, ndongo, to, weaken, the, portuguese, colonial, administration, nzinga, dispatched, messengers, makunzes, to, encourage, mbande, slaves, to, flee, portuguese, plantations, and, join, her, kingdom, thereby, depriving, the, colony, of, its, income, and, manpower, when, the, portuguese, complained, about, the, escapes, nzinga, replied, that, she, would, abide, by, her, earlier, treaty, and, return, escaped, slaves, but, that, her, kingdom, had, none, her, actions, were, a, success, and, many, sobas, joined, forces, with, her, strengthening, her, position, and, causing, the, portuguese, to, fear, a, mbande, uprising, was, imminent, despite, these, successes, nzinga, s, policies, threatened, the, income, of, the, portuguese, and, mbande, nobles, and, soon, the, portuguese, began, to, foment, rebellion, in, her, kingdom, in, late, 1625, the, portuguese, sent, soldiers, to, protect, hari, a, kiluanje, a, soba, who, had, broken, ties, with, nzinga, kiluanje, opposed, having, a, woman, rule, ndongo, and, was, himself, descended, from, the, royal, family, upon, learning, of, his, actions, nzinga, sent, warriors, to, crush, his, revolt, but, was, defeated, weakening, her, position, and, convincing, more, nobles, to, revolt, nzinga, petitioned, the, portuguese, to, stop, supporting, kiluanje, and, attempted, to, negotiate, as, long, as, possible, while, she, gathered, more, forces, but, the, portuguese, guessed, this, was, a, delaying, tactic, and, soon, recognized, kiluanje, as, king, of, ndongo, the, portuguese, subsequently, declared, war, on, nzinga, on, 15, march, 1626, facing, a, portuguese, invasion, nzinga, gathered, her, army, and, withdrew, to, a, group, of, islands, in, the, kwanza, river, after, a, series, of, battles, she, was, defeated, and, forced, to, make, a, long, march, into, eastern, ndongo, during, the, retreat, she, was, forced, to, abandon, most, of, her, followers, a, strategy, that, greatly, benefited, her, as, the, portuguese, were, more, interested, in, re, capturing, slaves, than, in, pursuing, her, army, the, portuguese, soon, suffered, their, own, setback, when, hari, a, kiluanje, died, of, smallpox, forcing, them, to, replace, him, as, king, with, ngola, hari, another, ndongan, nobleman, ngola, hari, proved, to, be, an, unpopular, leader, with, the, ndongan, people, who, viewed, him, as, a, portuguese, puppet, while, some, sobas, supported, his, rule, a, divide, soon, formed, inside, the, kingdom, of, ndongo, in, which, the, common, people, and, lesser, nobles, supported, nzinga, while, many, powerful, nobles, supported, ngola, hari, and, the, portuguese, in, november, 1627, nzinga, again, attempted, to, negotiate, with, the, portuguese, sending, a, peace, delegation, and, a, gift, of, 400, slaves, she, indicated, that, she, was, willing, to, become, a, vassal, of, the, kingdom, of, portugal, and, pay, tribute, if, they, supported, her, claim, to, the, throne, but, was, adamant, that, she, was, the, rightful, queen, of, ndongo, the, portuguese, however, rejected, the, offer, beheading, her, lead, diplomat, and, issuing, the, counter, demand, that, she, retire, from, public, life, renounce, her, claim, to, the, kingdom, of, ndongo, and, submit, to, ngola, hari, as, rightful, king, these, demands, were, within, the, diplomatic, norm, in, europe, but, were, utterly, unacceptable, to, nzinga, faced, with, the, portuguese, rebuke, and, the, realization, that, many, ndongan, nobles, stood, against, her, nzinga, as, had, her, father, and, brother, slipped, into, depression, locking, herself, in, a, room, for, several, weeks, she, emerged, however, and, within, a, month, had, begun, a, new, campaign, to, rebuild, her, alliances, in, ndongo, while, rebuilding, her, strength, nzinga, took, advantage, of, ngola, hari, s, political, weakness, highlighting, his, lack, of, political, experience, ngola, hari, was, despised, by, both, his, nobles, and, his, portuguese, allies, for, while, previous, kings, of, ndongo, had, all, been, warriors, ngola, hari, had, no, soldiers, of, his, own, and, was, forced, to, rely, on, portuguese, soldiers, ngola, hari, and, the, portuguese, launched, a, counter, propaganda, campaign, against, nzinga, hoping, to, use, her, gender, as, a, means, to, delegitimize, her, strength, but, this, backfired, as, she, increasingly, outmaneuvered, ngola, hari, in, ndongan, politics, in, one, notable, incident, nzinga, sent, ngola, hari, threatening, letters, and, a, collection, of, fetishes, challenging, him, to, combat, with, her, forces, the, messages, terrified, hari, who, was, forced, to, call, on, his, portuguese, allies, for, support, thus, greatly, diminishing, his, own, prestige, while, adding, to, nzinga, s, reputation, however, she, was, still, unable, to, directly, face, the, portuguese, in, battle, and, was, forced, to, retreat, from, the, advancing, portuguese, army, she, suffered, a, series, of, military, defeats, most, notably, in, a, portuguese, ambush, that, saw, half, of, her, army, most, of, her, officials, and, her, two, sisters, captured, though, she, herself, was, able, to, escape, by, late, 1628, nzinga, s, army, had, been, greatly, reduced, down, to, around, 200, soldiers, according, to, one, source, and, she, had, been, effectively, expelled, from, her, kingdom, following, her, expulsion, nzinga, and, her, supporters, continued, to, fight, against, the, portuguese, to, bolster, her, forces, the, queen, looked, to, make, allies, in, the, region, while, keeping, her, battered, forces, out, of, reach, of, the, portuguese, army, during, this, time, she, was, contacted, by, kasanje, a, powerful, imbangala, warlord, who, had, established, his, own, kingdom, on, the, kwanza, river, kasanje, and, the, imbangala, were, traditional, enemies, of, ndongo, and, kasanje, himself, had, previously, executed, several, of, nzinga, s, envoys, kasanje, offered, nzinga, an, alliance, and, military, support, but, in, return, demanded, that, she, marry, him, and, discard, her, lunga, a, large, bell, used, by, ndongan, war, captains, as, a, symbol, of, their, power, nzinga, accepted, these, terms, married, kasanje, and, was, inducted, into, imbangala, society, the, exiled, queen, adapted, quickly, to, the, new, culture, adopting, many, imbangala, religious, rites, sources, african, western, modern, contemporary, disagree, on, the, intricacies, and, extent, of, imbangala, rites, and, laws, ijila, but, the, general, consensus, is, that, nzinga, was, compelled, to, participate, in, the, customary, cannibalistic, the, drinking, of, human, blood, in, the, cuia, or, blood, oath, ceremony, and, infanticidal, through, the, use, of, an, oil, made, from, a, slain, infant, the, maji, a, samba, initiation, rites, required, for, a, woman, to, become, a, leader, in, the, highly, militarized, imbangala, society, the, ritual, was, in, part, to, prevent, a, succession, crisis, amongst, the, imbangala, in, the, future, she, did, not, however, completely, abandon, her, mbundan, cultural, roots, instead, combining, the, beliefs, of, her, people, with, those, of, her, new, imbangalan, allies, as, noted, by, historian, linda, heywood, nzinga, s, genius, was, to, combine, her, mbundu, heritage, with, the, imbangalan, s, central, african, military, tradition, and, leadership, structure, thus, forming, a, new, highly, capable, army, to, increase, her, numbers, she, granted, freedom, to, escaped, slaves, and, land, new, slaves, and, titles, to, other, exiled, ndongans, according, to, some, sources, nzinga, having, been, disenfranchised, by, the, mbundu, dominated, nobility, of, ndongo, was, politically, attracted, to, the, imbangalans, who, placed, more, value, on, merit, and, religious, fervor, as, opposed, to, lineage, kinship, and, by, extension, sex, using, her, new, power, base, nzinga, remodeled, her, forces, after, the, highly, effective, imbangala, warriors, by, 1631, she, had, rebuilt, her, army, and, was, waging, a, successful, guerilla, war, against, the, portuguese, with, one, jesuit, priest, living, in, the, kongo, at, the, time, describing, her, as, being, akin, to, an, amazon, queen, and, praising, her, leadership, between, 1631, and, 1635, nzingha, invaded, the, neighboring, kingdom, of, matamba, capturing, and, deposing, queen, mwongo, matamba, in, 1631, nzingha, had, the, defeated, queen, branded, but, spared, her, life, imbangala, custom, mandated, she, execute, her, and, took, mwongo, s, daughter, into, her, service, as, one, of, her, warriors, having, defeated, the, matambans, nzinga, assumed, the, throne, of, matamba, and, began, settling, the, region, with, exiled, ndongans, hoping, to, use, the, kingdom, as, a, base, to, wage, her, war, to, reclaim, her, homeland, unlike, her, native, ndongo, matamba, had, a, cultural, tradition, of, female, leadership, giving, nzinga, a, more, stable, power, base, after, she, overthrew, the, previous, queen, with, matamba, under, her, control, nzinga, worked, extensively, to, expand, the, slave, trade, in, her, new, kingdom, using, the, profits, from, slave, trading, to, finance, her, wars, and, divert, trade, income, away, from, the, portuguese, over, the, next, decade, nzinga, continued, to, struggle, against, the, portuguese, and, their, allies, with, both, sides, attempting, to, limit, each, other, s, influence, and, take, control, over, the, slave, trade, during, this, decade, nzinga, took, on, more, masculine, traits, adopting, male, titles, and, clothing, she, established, an, all, female, bodyguard, for, herself, and, ordered, that, her, male, concubines, wear, women, s, clothing, and, address, her, as, king, she, also, instituted, communal, sleeping, quarters, at, her, court, and, enforced, strict, chastity, rules, for, her, male, councilors, and, female, bodyguards, by, the, late, 1630s, nzinga, had, expanded, her, influence, to, the, north, and, south, of, matamba, using, her, forces, she, cut, other, rulers, off, from, the, portuguese, controlled, coast, capturing, parts, of, the, kwango, river, and, bringing, the, region, s, key, slave, supplying, lands, under, her, control, she, also, expanded, her, territory, to, the, north, and, in, doing, so, established, diplomatic, relations, with, the, kingdom, of, the, kongo, and, dutch, merchants, who, were, increasingly, active, in, the, area, nzinga, also, established, a, lucrative, slave, trade, with, the, dutch, who, purchased, as, many, as, 13, 000, slaves, per, year, from, nzinga, s, kingdom, she, continued, to, occasionally, send, peace, overtures, to, the, portuguese, even, suggesting, a, military, alliance, with, them, but, only, if, they, supported, her, return, to, ndongo, she, also, refused, to, be, re, admitted, to, the, christian, faith, which, became, a, point, of, contention, between, the, two, parties, in, 1641, forces, from, the, dutch, west, india, company, working, in, alliance, with, the, kingdom, of, kongo, seized, luanda, driving, out, the, portuguese, and, setting, up, the, directorate, of, loango, angola, the, fall, of, luanda, was, a, major, blow, to, the, portuguese, and, nzinga, quickly, dispatched, an, embassy, to, the, dutch, controlled, city, hoping, to, form, an, afro, dutch, coalition, against, the, portuguese, nzinga, requested, an, immediate, alliance, and, offered, to, open, the, slave, trade, to, them, though, she, was, concerned, that, the, kingdom, of, kongo, her, people, s, traditional, northern, rivals, was, growing, too, powerful, the, dutch, accepted, her, offer, of, an, alliance, and, sent, their, own, ambassador, and, soldiers, some, of, whom, brought, their, wives, to, her, court, soon, assisting, her, in, her, fight, against, the, portuguese, having, lost, large, amounts, of, territory, and, forced, to, retreat, to, massangano, the, portuguese, governor, attempted, to, make, peace, with, nzinga, but, she, refused, these, overtures, nzingha, moved, her, capital, to, kavanga, in, the, northern, part, of, ndongo, s, former, domains, the, capture, of, luanda, also, left, nzingha, s, kingdom, as, the, pre, eminent, if, temporary, slave, trading, power, in, the, region, allowing, for, her, to, build, a, sizeable, war, camp, kilombo, of, 80, 000, a, figure, which, included, non, combatants, members, including, mercenaries, escaped, slaves, allies, and, her, own, soldiers, using, the, large, size, of, her, army, her, new, wealth, and, her, famous, reputation, nzinga, was, able, to, reclaim, large, parts, of, ndongo, from, 1641, to, 1644, however, her, expansionism, caused, alarm, amongst, other, african, kingdoms, in, one, infamous, incident, she, invaded, the, wandu, region, of, kongo, which, had, been, in, revolt, against, the, kongolese, king, though, these, lands, had, never, been, part, of, ndongo, nzinga, refused, to, withdraw, and, added, the, conquest, to, her, kingdom, an, act, which, greatly, offended, the, kongolese, king, garcia, ii, the, dutch, hoping, to, preserve, their, alliance, with, both, kongo, and, nzinga, brokered, a, peace, but, relations, between, nzinga, and, other, regional, leaders, remained, strained, in, addition, her, former, husband, and, ally, kasanje, feared, her, growing, power, in, the, region, and, formed, a, coalition, of, imbangala, leaders, against, nzinga, invading, her, lands, in, matamba, though, they, made, little, progress, by, the, mid, 1640s, her, successes, had, won, her, the, support, of, many, ndongan, nobles, with, the, nobility, flocking, to, her, side, nzingha, was, able, to, collect, more, tribute, in, the, form, of, slaves, which, she, in, turn, sold, to, the, dutch, in, exchange, for, firearms, thereby, increasing, her, military, and, economic, power, by, 1644, she, considered, garcia, ii, of, the, kongo, to, be, her, only, political, equal, in, the, region, while, the, portuguese, viewed, her, as, their, most, potent, adversary, in, africa, in, 1644, nzinga, defeated, the, portuguese, army, at, the, battle, of, ngoleme, then, in, 1646, she, was, defeated, by, the, portuguese, at, the, battle, of, kavanga, and, in, the, process, her, sister, kambu, was, recaptured, along, with, her, archives, which, revealed, her, alliance, with, kongo, these, archives, also, showed, that, her, captive, sister, funji, had, been, in, secret, correspondence, with, nzinga, and, had, revealed, coveted, portuguese, plans, to, her, as, a, result, of, the, woman, s, spying, the, portuguese, reputedly, drowned, the, sister, in, the, kwanza, river, the, dutch, in, luanda, sent, nzinga, reinforcements, and, with, their, help, nzinga, routed, a, portuguese, army, in, 1647, at, the, battle, of, kombi, nzinga, then, laid, siege, to, the, portuguese, capital, of, massangano, isolating, the, portuguese, there, by, 1648, nzingha, controlled, much, of, her, former, kingdom, while, her, control, over, the, slave, trade, increased, the, economic, power, of, matamba, despite, these, successes, the, allies, control, over, angola, remained, tenuous, lacking, artillery, nzinga, was, unable, to, effectively, break, the, portuguese, defenses, at, massangano, while, political, infighting, and, developments, in, europe, weakened, the, dutch, forces, in, angola, in, august, 1648, a, portuguese, expedition, led, by, newly, appointed, governor, salvador, correia, de, s, besieged, luanda, after, suffering, through, a, major, portuguese, bombardment, on, 24, august, 1648, the, dutch, commander, sued, for, peace, with, the, portuguese, and, agreed, to, evacuate, angola, when, nzinga, s, army, and, the, remaining, dutch, forces, arrived, outside, luanda, the, peace, between, dutch, and, portuguese, was, signed, and, unbeknownst, to, nzinga, the, dutch, forces, sailed, for, europe, faced, with, a, bolstered, portuguese, garrison, nzinga, and, her, forces, retreated, to, matamba, unlike, previous, decades, however, after, 1648, nzinga, concentrated, her, efforts, on, preventing, a, portuguese, push, inland, as, opposed, to, trying, to, re, conquer, ndongan, territory, disrupting, their, soldiers, and, fomenting, wars, between, smaller, tribes, and, kingdoms, while, her, wars, against, the, portuguese, and, their, allies, continued, nzingha, created, alliances, with, neighboring, kingdoms, expanding, her, influence, even, as, she, aged, she, sent, soldiers, to, enforce, her, rule, over, local, noblemen, dispatched, forces, to, fight, against, kasanje, s, imbangalans, in, eastern, matamba, and, fought, against, the, kingdom, of, kaka, in, the, congo, she, also, used, her, army, as, a, political, tool, using, its, influence, to, sway, the, outcomes, of, succession, disputes, in, her, favor, throughout, the, 1640s, and, 1650s, nzinga, began, to, tentatively, adopt, christian, cultural, traditions, following, her, conversion, to, the, faith, in, 1623, this, began, in, 1644, when, her, army, captured, a, portuguese, priest, and, expanded, when, her, forces, in, kongo, captured, two, spanish, capuchins, in, 1648, unlike, other, european, prisoners, the, queen, granted, missionaries, extended, freedoms, in, her, war, camp, one, of, the, spaniards, father, calisto, zelotes, do, reis, mago, would, go, on, to, become, a, longtime, resident, at, her, court, and, her, personal, secretary, whereas, previous, missionaries, either, parish, priests, or, jesuits, had, been, strongly, affiliated, with, the, portuguese, and, their, colonial, administration, the, spanish, capuchins, were, more, sympathetic, to, nzinga, s, positions, during, the, early, 1650s, nzinga, sent, requests, to, the, capuchin, order, for, more, missionaries, and, for, support, against, the, portuguese, effectively, turning, the, missionaries, into, de, facto, diplomats, between, her, and, the, vatican, she, pursued, closer, relations, with, catholic, leaders, in, europe, for, the, rest, of, her, life, even, receiving, correspondence, from, pope, alexander, vii, in, 1661, praising, her, efforts, in, addition, to, using, christianity, as, a, diplomatic, tool, nzinga, adopted, christian, customs, into, her, court, from, the, 1650s, onward, she, increasingly, relied, on, christian, converts, at, her, court, just, as, she, had, done, with, the, imbangalan, culture, several, decades, before, nzinga, appropriated, aspects, of, christian, ideology, and, culture, adding, these, to, her, existing, court, traditions, to, create, a, new, class, of, christian, councilors, loyal, to, her, she, also, began, practicing, catholic, inspired, rituals, placed, crosses, in, places, of, high, honor, in, her, court, and, built, many, churches, across, her, kingdom, nzinga, s, efforts, to, convert, her, people, was, not, without, controversy, and, some, conservative, religious, figures, pushed, back, against, her, policies, in, response, nzinga, empowered, her, christian, priests, to, burn, the, temples, and, shrines, of, practitioners, who, opposed, her, and, ordered, that, they, be, arrested, and, turned, over, to, her, for, trial, traditionalists, were, dismissed, from, her, court, after, which, she, sentenced, them, to, public, whippings, several, prominent, mdundu, and, imbangala, priests, were, sold, as, slaves, to, the, portuguese, with, nzinga, personally, asking, that, they, be, shipped, overseas, profits, of, the, sale, were, then, used, to, furnish, a, new, church, some, of, the, wanted, priests, however, escaped, nzinga, s, purge, and, went, into, hiding, later, working, to, undermine, her, legitimacy, as, queen, by, 1650, the, kingdoms, of, matamba, and, portugal, had, been, at, war, for, nearly, 25, years, with, both, sides, having, become, exhausted, tentative, peace, talks, between, nzingha, and, the, portuguese, began, in, 1651, continued, in, 1654, and, culminated, in, 1656, the, negotiations, were, aided, by, nzingha, s, recent, conversion, to, christianity, and, by, the, pressure, portugal, was, facing, from, its, war, of, independence, against, spain, the, portuguese, hoped, to, end, the, expensive, war, in, angola, and, re, open, the, slave, trade, while, nzingha, increasingly, cognizant, of, her, age, hoped, to, have, her, sister, kambu, often, referred, to, by, her, christian, name, barbara, during, this, period, released, she, would, not, however, pay, the, ransom, the, portuguese, demanded, for, her, sister, and, so, negotiations, repeatedly, stalled, despite, difficulties, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, between, nzingha, and, the, portuguese, in, late, 1656, under, the, term, of, the, peace, treaty, nzingha, agreed, to, cede, lands, on, her, kingdom, s, western, coast, to, portugal, with, the, lucala, river, becoming, the, new, border, between, portuguese, angola, and, matamba, in, return, portugal, ceded, the, kituxela, region, to, her, nzingha, also, agreed, to, allow, portuguese, traders, inside, matamba, while, they, agreed, to, intervene, if, kasanje, or, nogla, hari, attacked, her, the, portuguese, agreed, to, concentrate, the, slave, trade, in, a, market, in, her, capital, effectively, giving, her, a, monopoly, on, the, slave, trade, and, send, a, permanent, representative, to, her, court, in, return, nzingha, agreed, to, provide, military, assistance, to, the, portuguese, and, allowed, for, missionaries, to, reside, in, her, kingdom, a, final, provision, asking, that, matamba, pay, portugal, tribute, was, proposed, but, never, ratified, while, several, sources, describe, the, treaty, as, making, concessions, to, portugal, others, note, that, her, recognition, as, a, ruler, by, portugal, gained, nzingha, legitimacy, and, political, stability, on, 12, october, nzingha, s, sister, arrived, at, nzingha, s, court, in, matamba, in, a, procession, led, by, father, ignazio, de, valassina, upon, kambu, s, arrival, to, matamba, the, terms, of, peace, were, officially, agreed, upon, and, as, was, tradition, nzingha, and, her, officials, clapped, their, hands, letting, the, portuguese, know, that, peace, terms, were, accepted, after, the, wars, with, portugal, ended, nzingha, attempted, to, rebuild, her, kingdom, as, noted, by, linda, heywood, nzingha, s, final, years, were, spent, establishing, a, unified, kingdom, she, could, pass, on, to, her, sister, however, her, native, ndongo, had, been, ravaged, by, decades, of, war, with, wide, swathes, of, the, land, left, depopulated, as, such, nzingha, focused, her, efforts, on, strengthening, matamba, she, developed, matamba, as, a, trading, power, by, capitalizing, on, its, strategic, position, as, the, gateway, to, the, central, african, interior, strengthening, her, hold, on, the, slave, trade, she, resettled, former, slaves, on, new, land, and, allowed, women, in, her, war, camp, to, bear, children, which, had, been, banned, under, the, wartime, imbangala, customs, she, also, reformed, the, legal, code, of, her, kingdom, and, established, contact, with, christian, rulers, in, europe, hoping, to, certify, matamba, s, status, as, an, internationally, recognized, christian, kingdom, peace, caused, major, changes, at, nzingha, s, royal, court, whereas, in, wartime, she, had, adopted, the, masculine, dress, and, mannerisms, of, an, imbangala, warlord, in, the, postwar, era, nzingha, s, court, became, more, feminine, she, adopted, new, fashions, in, court, imported, silk, and, goods, from, europe, placed, renewed, focus, on, education, replacing, military, drills, and, abolished, concubinage, eventually, marrying, her, favorite, concubine, in, a, christian, ceremony, nzingha, wary, of, a, potential, succession, crisis, also, worked, to, increase, the, power, of, the, royal, family, in, ndongo, she, distanced, herself, from, the, imbangalan, culture, and, abolished, many, of, the, democratic, and, meritocratic, policies, she, had, tolerated, in, wartime, seeing, them, as, a, threat, to, the, monarchy, during, her, later, reign, divides, opened, in, her, court, between, educated, christian, converts, who, supported, her, royalist, policies, and, traditionalists, imbangalans, and, mbundus, who, supported, a, return, to, the, more, militaristic, meritocratic, policies, of, the, past, during, the, 1660s, specifically, after, a, period, of, serious, illness, in, 1657, nzinga, grew, increasingly, concerned, about, who, would, succeed, her, as, ruler, of, ndongo, and, matamba, she, feared, that, her, death, would, lead, to, a, succession, crisis, which, would, cause, her, christian, conversions, to, be, undone, and, spark, renewed, portuguese, aggression, to, ensure, the, transition, would, be, smooth, she, appointed, her, sister, kambu, as, her, heir, forgoing, any, of, the, traditional, mbundu, elections, however, she, grew, increasingly, concerned, that, her, sister, s, husband, nzinga, a, mona, was, growing, too, powerful, nzinga, a, mona, was, a, skilled, soldier, who, was, raised, in, the, imbangala, tradition, and, while, he, had, been, a, lifelong, soldier, in, nzingha, s, army, in, his, older, age, he, increasingly, came, into, conflict, with, nzinga, she, feared, that, nzinga, mona, s, adherence, to, imbangala, tradition, would, destabilize, the, new, christian, kingdom, she, had, established, in, october, 1663, nzinga, fell, ill, with, infection, in, her, throat, and, became, bedridden, by, december, of, that, year, the, infection, had, spread, to, her, lungs, and, nzinga, died, in, her, sleep, on, the, morning, of, 17, december, she, was, buried, with, great, aplomb, in, accordance, with, catholic, and, mbundu, traditions, ceremonies, were, held, across, matamba, and, in, luanda, where, both, the, portuguese, and, mbundu, populations, held, services, in, her, honor, following, nzinga, s, death, her, sister, kambu, more, commonly, known, as, barbara, or, dona, barbara, assumed, the, throne, a, powerful, queen, who, reigned, for, over, thirty, years, nzinga, has, been, the, subject, of, many, works, in, her, native, angola, oral, traditions, celebrating, nzinga, s, life, began, immediately, after, her, death, though, her, kingdoms, would, eventually, be, incorporated, into, portuguese, angola, commemoration, of, nzinga, and, her, achievements, persisted, in, the, mid, 20th, century, nzinga, became, a, powerful, symbol, of, angolan, resistance, against, portugal, during, the, angolan, war, of, independence, nzinga, s, legacy, would, outlast, the, angolan, civil, war, and, remains, an, area, of, interest, in, the, country, the, portuguese, nzinga, s, longtime, rivals, wrote, a, number, of, works, relating, to, her, life, the, first, biography, of, nzinga, was, published, by, antonio, da, gaeta, a, capuchin, priest, who, had, lived, in, her, court, in, 1669, gaeta, s, work, praised, nzinga, s, diplomatic, skills, and, compared, her, to, famous, women, from, antiquity, but, also, pointedly, noted, that, she, had, ultimately, been, persuaded, by, divine, providence, to, accept, christianity, antonio, cavazzi, another, capuchin, who, had, resided, in, nzinga, s, court, wrote, a, biography, of, her, in, 1689, again, noting, her, political, skill, but, also, describing, her, as, a, queen, who, had, ruined, the, land, together, gaeta, and, cavazzi, s, biographies, became, the, primary, sources, for, nzinga, s, life, portuguese, writers, would, continue, to, write, about, nzinga, into, the, 20th, century, normally, depicting, her, as, a, skilled, savage, opponent, who, had, ultimately, been, forced, to, submit, to, portugal, and, accept, christianity, numerous, western, authors, have, written, about, nzinga, the, first, notable, non, portuguese, western, work, mentioning, nzinga, was, written, by, french, jesuit, jean, baptiste, labat, in, 1732, a, heavily, edited, translation, of, cavazzi, s, earlier, biography, labat, s, work, formed, the, basis, on, which, many, western, sources, would, depict, their, image, of, nzinga, whereas, portuguese, sources, focused, on, nzinga, s, capabilities, as, a, leader, and, conversion, to, christianity, western, sources, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, tended, to, heavily, focus, on, her, sexuality, alleged, cannibalism, and, brutality, jean, louis, castilhon, wrote, a, fictional, story, of, her, life, in, 1769, portraying, her, as, cruel, but, not, a, cannibal, while, the, marquis, de, sade, wrote, about, nzinga, s, alleged, cruelty, and, promiscuity, in, his, 1795, work, philosophy, in, the, bedroom, in, which, he, cites, her, as, an, example, of, a, woman, driven, to, evil, by, passion, likewise, laure, junot, included, nzinga, as, a, symbol, of, cruelty, and, lust, in, her, memoirs, of, celebrated, women, of, all, countries, grouping, her, alongside, women, such, as, lady, jane, grey, marie, antoinette, and, catherine, i, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, was, also, critical, of, nzinga, s, though, he, did, not, directly, name, her, female, state, describing, her, kingdom, as, a, barren, unfertile, land, that, had, eventually, collapsed, due, to, her, usurping, of, the, natural, order, nzinga, s, reputation, in, the, west, recovered, significantly, in, the, 20th, century, nzinga, s, usage, as, a, symbol, in, the, angolan, war, of, independence, increased, interest, in, her, life, and, authors, began, to, take, a, more, nuanced, approach, to, her, biography, american, historian, joseph, c, miller, published, a, widely, cited, essay, on, nzinga, in, the, 1975, the, journal, of, african, history, highlighting, her, struggles, and, innovations, but, also, criticizing, her, autocratic, methods, afro, cuban, poet, georgina, herrera, published, a, 1978, poem, extolling, nzinga, s, wisdom, and, connecting, her, culturally, with, afro, caribbeans, in, the, americas, american, feminist, author, aurora, levins, morales, wrote, about, nzinga, praising, her, anti, colonial, and, anti, patriarchal, struggles, but, also, criticizing, her, status, as, a, ruling, elite, and, her, propagation, of, the, slave, trade, in, his, writings, on, nzinga, american, historian, john, thornton, focused, on, her, lifelong, struggle, to, establish, her, authority, over, the, mbundu, culture, noting, that, her, legendary, reputation, and, actions, helped, to, establish, a, wider, atlantic, creole, culture, american, historian, linda, heywood, wrote, an, extensive, biography, of, nzinga, in, 2017, featuring, much, of, her, life, and, describing, her, as, a, great, historical, figure, heywood, cautioned, against, portraying, nzinga, as, either, a, populist, hero, or, tyrant, noting, instead, that, she, should, be, viewed, as, a, complicated, individual, who, used, culture, diplomacy, religion, and, war, to, secure, her, kingdom, one, legend, records, that, nzinga, executed, her, lovers, she, kept, 50, 60, men, dressed, as, women, according, to, dapper, s, description, of, africa, as, her, harem, and, she, had, them, fight, to, the, death, for, the, privilege, and, duty, of, spending, the, night, with, her, in, the, morning, the, winner, was, put, to, death, according, to, an, account, by, the, capuchin, priest, cavazzi, nzinga, maintained, her, strength, well, into, her, later, years, upon, witnessing, her, during, a, military, review, in, 1662, the, year, prior, to, her, death, cavazzi, praised, her, agility, to, which, the, elder, queen, replied, that, in, her, youth, she, was, able, to, wound, any, imbangala, warrior, and, that, she, would, have, stood, against, 25, armed, men, unless, they, had, muskets, today, she, is, remembered, in, angola, as, the, mother, of, angola, the, fighter, of, negotiations, and, the, protector, of, her, people, she, is, still, honored, throughout, africa, as, a, remarkable, leader, and, woman, for, her, political, and, diplomatic, acumen, as, well, as, her, brilliant, military, tactics, accounts, of, her, life, are, often, romanticized, and, she, is, considered, a, symbol, of, the, fight, against, oppression, nzingha, ultimately, managed, to, shape, her, state, into, a, form, that, tolerated, her, authority, though, surely, the, fact, that, she, survived, all, attacks, on, her, and, built, up, a, strong, base, of, loyal, supporters, helped, as, much, as, the, relevance, of, the, precedents, she, cited, while, njinga, had, obviously, not, overcome, the, idea, that, females, could, not, rule, in, ndongo, during, her, lifetime, and, had, to, become, a, male, to, retain, power, her, female, successors, faced, little, problem, in, being, accepted, as, rulers, the, clever, use, of, her, gender, and, her, political, understandings, helped, lay, a, foundation, for, future, leaders, of, ndongo, today, in, the, period, of, 104, years, that, followed, njinga, s, death, in, 1663, queens, ruled, for, at, least, eighty, of, them, nzingha, is, a, leadership, role, model, for, all, generations, of, angolan, women, women, in, angola, today, display, remarkable, social, independence, and, are, found, in, the, country, s, army, police, force, government, and, public, and, private, economic, sectors, nzingha, was, embraced, as, a, symbol, of, the, people, s, movement, for, the, liberation, of, angola, during, civil, war, a, major, street, in, luanda, is, named, after, her, and, a, statue, of, her, was, placed,
