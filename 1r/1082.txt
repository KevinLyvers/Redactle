birth, and, culminated, in, his, estrangement, from, his, family, he, was, nevertheless, a, prominent, military, commander, and, the, progenitor, of, the, family, who, ruled, over, the, khanate, of, the, golden, horde, jochi, was, the, son, of, b, rte, the, first, wife, of, the, mongol, leader, tem, jin, for, many, months, before, jochi, s, birth, b, rte, had, been, a, captive, of, the, merkit, tribe, during, which, she, was, forcibly, married, and, raped, by, one, of, their, number, although, there, was, thus, considerable, doubt, over, jochi, s, parentage, tem, jin, considered, him, his, son, and, treated, him, accordingly, many, mongols, most, prominently, b, rte, s, next, son, chagatai, disagreed, these, tensions, eventually, led, to, jochi, being, excluded, from, the, line, of, succession, to, the, mongol, throne, after, tem, jin, founded, the, mongol, empire, in, 1206, and, took, the, name, genghis, khan, he, entrusted, jochi, with, nine, thousand, warriors, and, a, large, territory, in, the, west, of, the, mongol, heartland, jochi, commanded, and, participated, in, numerous, campaigns, to, secure, and, extend, mongol, power, in, the, region, he, was, also, a, prominent, commander, during, the, invasion, of, the, khwarazmian, empire, 1219, 1221, during, which, he, subdued, cities, and, tribes, to, the, north, however, during, the, 1221, siege, of, gurganj, tensions, arose, between, him, his, brothers, and, genghis, which, never, healed, jochi, was, still, estranged, from, his, family, when, he, died, of, ill, health, c, 1225, his, son, batu, was, appointed, to, rule, his, territories, in, his, stead, jochi, s, mother, b, rte, was, born, into, the, onggirat, tribe, who, lived, along, the, greater, khingan, mountain, range, south, of, the, erg, ne, river, in, modern, day, inner, mongolia, at, the, age, of, ten, she, was, betrothed, to, a, mongol, boy, named, tem, jin, son, of, the, mongol, chieftain, yesugei, seven, years, later, c, 1178, after, he, had, survived, a, turbulent, adolescence, they, married, they, had, their, first, child, a, daughter, named, qojin, in, 1179, or, 1180, by, forming, alliances, with, notable, steppe, leaders, such, as, his, friend, jamukha, and, his, father, s, former, ally, toghrul, and, with, the, help, of, his, charisma, tem, jin, had, begun, to, attract, followers, and, gain, power, word, of, his, rise, spread, and, soon, drew, the, attention, of, the, merkit, tribe, from, whom, yesugei, had, abducted, tem, jin, s, mother, h, el, n, sparking, a, blood, feud, they, resolved, to, take, revenge, on, yesugei, s, heir, because, of, their, consequences, the, subsequent, events, were, considered, highly, controversial, most, contemporary, authors, omitted, any, mention, of, the, events, while, the, two, that, did, the, secret, history, of, the, mongols, a, mid, 13th, century, epic, poem, and, the, 14th, century, persian, historian, rashid, al, din, s, jami, al, tawarikh, are, highly, contradictory, in, 1180, or, 1181, a, large, force, of, merkits, raided, tem, jin, s, camp, while, most, of, his, family, managed, to, escape, b, rte, was, captured, she, was, forcibly, married, to, chilger, b, k, the, younger, brother, of, h, el, n, s, original, husband, meanwhile, tem, jin, had, convinced, his, allies, to, assemble, substantial, forces, to, help, him, rescue, b, rte, under, jamukha, s, command, the, combined, army, campaigned, against, the, merkits, and, defeated, them, recovering, b, rte, and, taking, large, amounts, of, plunder, however, there, was, a, problem, b, rte, was, heavily, pregnant, and, soon, in, jamukha, s, camp, gave, birth, to, jochi, as, chilger, b, k, had, undoubtedly, raped, her, and, as, she, had, been, among, the, merkits, for, nearly, nine, months, jochi, s, paternity, was, uncertain, this, was, reflected, in, his, name, meaning, guest, in, mongolian, while, tem, jin, always, regarded, jochi, as, his, son, by, blood, and, treated, him, accordingly, many, mongols, such, as, his, younger, brother, chagatai, viewed, him, as, a, bastard, sired, by, chilger, b, k, by, 1203, jochi, was, old, enough, for, marriage, tem, jin, intended, to, betroth, him, to, a, daughter, of, his, ally, toghrul, but, this, proposal, was, taken, as, insulting, by, toghrul, s, people, and, eventually, led, to, war, between, the, two, leaders, after, toghrul, s, defeat, jochi, was, given, one, of, his, nieces, begt, tmish, as, a, wife, he, also, married, other, women, b, rte, s, niece, ki, her, relative, sorghan, and, several, less, powerful, women, namely, qutlugh, khatun, sultan, khatun, nubqus, sh, r, qarajin, and, kul, in, addition, jochi, took, concubines, it, is, unknown, who, jochi, s, senior, wife, was, but, it, was, likely, either, ki, or, sorghan, jochi, s, most, important, sons, were, orda, khan, and, batu, khan, they, were, the, children, of, sorghan, and, ki, respectively, neither, these, women, nor, begt, tmish, was, the, mother, of, jochi, s, other, notable, son, berke, the, names, of, eleven, other, sons, are, known, but, none, had, significant, careers, reflecting, the, junior, status, of, their, mothers, descendants, of, younger, sons, nevertheless, used, their, jochid, lineage, to, legitimise, their, right, to, rule, these, included, khi, r, khan, of, shiban, s, line, and, tokhtamysh, who, descended, from, jochi, s, youngest, son, tuqa, timur, in, 1206, having, united, the, tribes, of, mongolia, tem, jin, held, a, large, assembly, called, a, kurultai, where, he, was, acclaimed, as, genghis, khan, he, also, began, to, reorder, his, new, nation, dividing, it, between, members, of, his, ruling, dynasty, as, the, eldest, son, jochi, received, the, largest, share, nine, thousand, subject, warriors, all, with, their, own, families, and, herds, chagatai, received, eight, thousand, and, their, younger, brothers, gedei, and, tolui, received, five, thousand, each, as, expected, for, a, firstborn, jochi, received, the, territories, furthest, away, from, the, homeland, for, his, ulus, domain, they, were, located, in, western, mongolia, along, the, river, irtysh, this, allocation, was, made, with, the, expectation, that, jochi, would, expand, and, so, in, 1207, 08, he, campaigned, against, and, subjugated, the, hoi, yin, irgen, a, collection, of, tribes, on, the, edge, of, the, siberian, taiga, between, the, angara, and, irtysh, rivers, jochi, secured, a, marriage, alliance, with, the, oirats, whose, leader, qutuqa, beki, guided, the, mongols, to, the, yenisei, kyrgyz, and, other, hoi, yin, irgen, these, tribes, soon, submitted, and, jochi, took, control, of, the, region, s, trade, in, grain, and, furs, as, well, as, its, gold, mines, he, subsequently, reinforced, subutai, s, army, before, it, defeated, the, renegade, merkits, at, the, battle, of, the, irtysh, river, in, late, 1208, or, early, 1209, jochi, would, campaign, intermittently, against, the, merkits, and, their, qangli, allies, for, the, next, decade, finally, destroying, the, last, remnants, of, the, people, in, 1217, or, 1218, alongside, subutai, the, historian, christopher, atwood, has, argued, that, this, narrative, minimised, jochi, s, role, that, in, reality, he, not, subutai, was, the, primary, commander, in, all, campaigns, against, the, merkit, and, qangli, and, that, his, right, to, rule, the, former, qangli, lands, was, justified, by, the, success, of, the, campaigns, alongside, his, brothers, chagatai, and, gedei, jochi, commanded, the, right, wing, in, the, 1211, invasion, of, the, chinese, jin, dynasty, the, mongols, marched, southwards, from, genghis, s, campaign, headquarters, in, modern, inner, mongolia, in, november, 1211, first, they, attacked, the, cities, in, the, area, between, hohhot, and, datong, and, then, they, followed, the, taihang, mountains, into, shanxi, where, they, pillaged, and, plundered, in, autumn, 1213, he, may, have, also, taken, part, in, the, irghiz, river, skirmish, an, inconclusive, engagement, fought, against, the, army, of, muhammad, ii, of, khwarazm, the, secret, history, records, two, conversations, between, jochi, and, his, father, about, his, campaigns, once, when, genghis, declined, jochi, s, request, to, spare, the, life, of, a, renowned, merkit, archer, and, once, when, jochi, s, triumphant, return, from, the, subjugation, of, the, oirats, garnered, high, praise, from, his, father, in, 1218, genghis, was, provoked, into, launching, a, campaign, against, the, central, asian, khwarazmian, empire, after, a, mongol, trade, caravan, was, killed, by, the, governor, of, the, border, town, of, otrar, and, subsequent, diplomatic, overtures, failed, according, to, the, secret, history, yesui, one, of, genghis, s, secondary, wives, requested, him, to, decide, the, succession, before, setting, out, though, genghis, appears, not, to, have, cared, about, jochi, s, possible, illegitimacy, chagatai, vehemently, objected, to, his, brother, becoming, the, next, khan, shouting, how, can, we, let, ourselves, be, ruled, by, this, merkit, bastard, after, the, brawling, brothers, were, pulled, apart, the, secret, history, continues, the, suggestion, of, gedei, as, a, compromise, candidate, was, endorsed, by, both, brothers, and, their, father, because, of, other, sources, which, present, a, less, febrile, gathering, which, took, place, after, the, war, s, conclusion, some, historians, speculate, that, the, secret, history, s, account, was, a, later, interpolation, and, that, jochi, only, lost, his, place, as, heir, after, making, mistakes, during, the, khwarazmian, campaign, the, mongol, armies, estimated, to, number, 150, 000, or, 200, 000, men, in, total, descended, upon, otrar, in, late, 1219, leaving, chagatai, and, gedei, to, besiege, the, town, genghis, took, their, younger, brother, tolui, and, traversed, the, kyzyl, kum, desert, to, attack, the, city, of, bukhara, meanwhile, jochi, was, dispatched, to, march, down, the, syr, darya, river, in, the, direction, of, the, khwarazmian, capital, gurganj, and, subdue, all, the, cities, en, route, which, genghis, intended, to, become, part, of, jochi, s, territories, the, towns, of, sighnaq, and, asanas, offered, particularly, stiff, resistance, and, their, inhabitants, were, thus, slaughtered, while, jand, and, yanikant, were, occupied, without, much, trouble, in, late, 1220, he, travelled, southwest, along, the, shores, of, the, aral, sea, to, gurganj, while, his, brothers, chagatai, and, gedei, having, captured, otrar, converged, on, his, position, there, are, contradictory, accounts, of, the, siege, of, gurganj, and, jochi, s, part, in, it, what, is, certain, is, that, the, siege, was, lengthy, lasting, between, four, and, seven, months, and, that, it, was, exceptionally, fierce, the, defiant, khwarazmian, defenders, forced, the, mongol, army, to, engage, in, bitter, house, by, house, urban, warfare, with, much, of, the, city, destroyed, either, by, burning, naphtha, or, flooding, from, collapsed, dams, after, the, city, s, eventual, fall, its, inhabitants, were, either, killed, or, enslaved, the, usual, narrative, of, the, siege, recounts, that, jochi, and, chagatai, quarrelled, on, how, best, to, conduct, its, progress, as, jochi, presumed, that, the, rich, city, would, become, part, of, his, domain, and, wished, to, damage, it, as, little, as, possible, chagatai, on, the, other, hand, held, no, such, qualms, when, genghis, heard, about, this, infighting, he, ordered, that, gedei, be, promoted, to, command, his, brothers, atwood, however, argues, that, this, narrative, was, a, later, invention, designed, to, buttress, gedei, s, rule, as, khan, of, the, empire, and, that, jochi, in, reality, retained, primacy, throughout, the, siege, whichever, narrative, is, preferred, jochi, lost, the, favour, of, his, father, following, the, siege, genghis, likely, considered, the, lengthy, destructive, siege, a, military, failure, and, was, also, slighted, by, jochi, s, failure, to, give, him, his, rightful, share, of, the, loot, after, its, conclusion, chagatai, and, gedei, departed, southwards, to, join, their, father, in, his, pursuit, of, the, renegade, khwarazmian, prince, jalal, al, din, while, jochi, moved, north, ostensibly, to, bring, the, qangli, to, heel, in, his, new, territories, which, included, the, steppes, west, of, the, river, chu, some, sources, allege, that, he, preferred, to, spend, his, time, hunting, an, activity, he, was, very, greatly, fond, of, it, is, unclear, if, he, ever, met, his, father, again, although, jochi, sent, huge, numbers, of, wild, asses, and, 20, 000, white, horses, to, genghis, as, a, gift, c, 1224, relations, were, steadily, worsening, because, of, jochi, s, preoccupation, with, his, territories, on, his, return, home, genghis, ordered, jochi, to, join, him, but, the, latter, claimed, he, was, too, ill, to, do, so, when, a, traveller, claimed, that, he, was, not, ill, and, merely, hunting, genghis, resolved, to, bring, him, to, heel, before, he, could, do, so, in, either, 1225, or, 1227, news, came, that, jochi, had, died, of, his, illness, one, account, states, that, jochi, had, been, so, offended, by, the, destruction, at, gurganj, that, he, had, made, a, secret, alliance, with, the, khwarazmians, and, that, having, found, out, genghis, ordered, that, jochi, be, poisoned, this, account, is, likely, a, fabrication, batu, was, confirmed, as, ruler, of, his, father, s, territories, by, genghis, his, elder, brother, orda, assumed, a, junior, position, while, their, younger, brothers, each, took, a, strip, of, land, to, rule, jochi, s, descendants, would, grow, more, independent, eventually, ruling, over, the, state, known, as, the, golden, horde, although, a, large, mausoleum, in, ulytau, region, in, kazakhstan, has, traditionally, been, identified, as, the, resting, place, of, jochi, s, remains, radiocarbon, dating, indicates, that, it, was, built, much, later, and, that, it, is, not, the, site, of, the, grave
