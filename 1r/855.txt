historian, he, is, best, known, for, his, works, democracy, in, america, appearing, in, two, volumes, 1835, and, 1840, and, the, old, regime, and, the, revolution, 1856, in, both, he, analyzed, the, living, standards, and, social, conditions, of, individuals, as, well, as, their, relationship, to, the, market, and, state, in, western, societies, democracy, in, america, was, published, after,

the, july, monarchy, 1830, 1848, and, then, during, the, second, republic, 1849, 1851, which, succeeded, the, february, 1848, revolution, he, retired, from, political, life, after, louis, napol, on, bonaparte, s, 2, december, 1851, coup, and, thereafter, began, work, on, the, old, regime, and, the, revolution, tocqueville, argued, the, importance, of, the, french, revolution, was, to, continue, the, process, of, modernizing, and, centralizing, the, french, state, which, had, begun, under, king, louis, xiv, he, believed, the, failure, of, the, revolution, came, from, the, inexperience, of, the, deputies, who, were, too, wedded, to, abstract, enlightenment, ideals, tocqueville, was, a, classical, liberal, who, advocated, parliamentary, government, and, was, skeptical, of, the, extremes, of, majoritarianism, during, his, time, in, parliament, he, was, first, a, member, of, the, centre, left, before, moving, to, the, centre, right, and, the, complex, and, restless, nature, of, his, liberalism, has, led, to, contrasting, interpretations, and, admirers, across, the, political, spectrum, tocqueville, came, from, an, old, aristocratic, norman, family, he, was, the, great, grandson, of, the, statesman, malesherbes, who, was, guillotined, in, 1793, his, parents, herv, louis, fran, ois, jean, bonaventure, cl, rel, count, of, tocqueville, an, officer, of, the, constitutional, guard, of, king, louis, xvi, and, louise, madeleine, le, peletier, de, rosanbo, narrowly, escaped, the, guillotine, due, to, the, fall, of, maximilien, robespierre, in, 1794, under, the, bourbon, restoration, tocqueville, s, father, became, a, noble, peer, and, prefect, tocqueville, attended, the, lyc, e, fabert, in, metz, tocqueville, who, despised, the, july, monarchy, 1830, 1848, began, his, political, career, in, 1839, from, 1839, to, 1851, he, served, as, member, of, the, lower, house, of, parliament, for, the, manche, department, valognes, he, sat, on, the, centre, left, defended, abolitionist, views, and, upheld, free, trade, while, supporting, the, colonisation, of, algeria, carried, on, by, louis, philippe, s, regime, in, 1842, he, was, elected, as, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1847, he, sought, to, found, a, young, left, jeune, gauche, party, which, would, advocate, wage, increases, a, progressive, tax, and, other, labor, concerns, in, order, to, undermine, the, appeal, of, the, socialists, tocqueville, was, also, elected, general, counsellor, of, manche, in, 1842, and, became, the, president, of, the, department, s, general, council, between, 1849, and, 1852, he, resigned, as, he, refused, to, pledge, allegiance, to, the, second, empire, according, to, one, account, tocqueville, s, political, position, became, untenable, during, this, time, in, the, sense, that, he, was, mistrusted, by, both, the, left, and, right, and, was, looking, for, an, excuse, to, leave, france, in, 1831, tocqueville, obtained, from, the, july, monarchy, a, mission, to, examine, prisons, and, penitentiaries, in, the, united, states, and, proceeded, there, with, his, lifelong, friend, gustave, de, beaumont, while, he, did, visit, some, prisons, tocqueville, traveled, widely, in, the, united, states, and, took, extensive, notes, on, his, observations, and, reflections, he, returned, within, nine, months, and, published, a, report, but, the, more, well, known, result, of, his, tour, was, de, la, d, mocratie, en, am, rique, which, appeared, in, 1835, beaumont, also, wrote, an, account, of, their, travels, in, jacksonian, america, marie, or, slavery, in, the, united, states, 1835, during, this, trip, tocqueville, made, a, side, trip, to, montreal, and, quebec, city, in, lower, canada, from, mid, august, to, early, september, 1831, apart, from, north, america, tocqueville, also, made, an, observational, tour, of, england, producing, memoir, on, pauperism, in, 1841, and, 1846, he, traveled, to, the, french, colony, of, algeria, his, first, travel, inspired, his, travail, sur, l, alg, rie, in, which, he, criticized, the, french, model, of, colonisation, which, emphasized, assimilation, to, western, culture, advocating, that, the, french, government, instead, adopt, a, form, of, indirect, rule, which, avoided, mixing, different, populations, together, he, went, as, far, as, openly, advocating, racial, segregation, as, a, form, of, consociationalism, between, european, colonists, and, arabs, through, the, implementation, of, two, different, legislative, systems, for, each, ethnic, group, a, half, century, before, implementation, of, the, 1881, indigenous, code, based, on, religion, in, 1835, tocqueville, journeyed, through, ireland, his, observations, provide, one, of, the, best, pictures, of, the, state, of, ireland, before, the, great, famine, 1845, 1849, they, chronicle, the, growing, catholic, middle, class, and, the, appalling, conditions, in, which, most, catholic, tenant, farmers, lived, tocqueville, made, clear, both, his, opposition, to, aristocratic, power, and, his, affinity, for, his, irish, co, religionists, after, the, fall, of, the, july, monarchy, in, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, tocqueville, was, elected, a, member, of, the, constituent, assembly, of, 1848, where, he, became, a, member, of, the, commission, charged, with, the, drafting, of, the, new, constitution, of, the, second, republic, 1848, 1851, he, defended, bicameralism, and, the, election, of, the, president, of, the, republic, by, universal, suffrage, as, the, countryside, was, thought, to, be, more, conservative, than, the, labouring, population, of, paris, he, conceived, of, universal, suffrage, as, a, means, to, counteract, the, revolutionary, spirit, of, paris, during, the, second, republic, tocqueville, sided, with, the, party, of, order, against, the, socialists, a, few, days, after, the, february, 1848, insurrection, he, anticipated, that, a, violent, clash, between, the, parisian, workers, population, led, by, socialists, agitating, in, favour, of, a, democratic, and, social, republic, and, the, conservatives, which, included, the, aristocracy, and, the, rural, population, would, be, inescapable, indeed, these, social, tensions, eventually, exploded, in, the, june, days, uprising, of, 1848, led, by, general, cavaignac, the, suppression, of, the, uprising, was, supported, by, tocqueville, who, advocated, the, regularization, of, the, state, of, siege, declared, by, cavaignac, and, other, measures, promoting, suspension, of, the, constitutional, order, between, may, and, september, tocqueville, participated, in, the, constitutional, commission, which, wrote, the, new, constitution, his, proposals, such, as, his, amendment, about, the, president, and, his, reelection, reflected, lessons, he, drew, from, his, north, american, experience, a, supporter, of, cavaignac, and, of, the, party, of, order, tocqueville, accepted, an, invitation, to, enter, odilon, barrot, s, government, as, minister, of, foreign, affairs, from, 3, june, to, 31, october, 1849, during, the, troubled, days, of, june, 1849, he, pleaded, with, interior, minister, jules, armand, dufaure, for, the, reestablishment, of, the, state, of, siege, in, the, capital, and, approved, the, arrest, of, demonstrators, tocqueville, who, since, february, 1848, had, supported, laws, restricting, political, freedoms, approved, the, two, laws, voted, immediately, after, the, june, 1849, days, which, restricted, the, liberty, of, clubs, and, freedom, of, the, press, this, active, support, in, favor, of, laws, restricting, political, freedoms, stands, in, contrast, of, his, defense, of, freedoms, in, democracy, in, america, according, to, tocqueville, he, favored, order, as, the, sine, qua, non, for, the, conduct, of, serious, politics, he, to, bring, the, kind, of, stability, to, french, political, life, that, would, permit, the, steady, growth, of, liberty, unimpeded, by, the, regular, rumblings, of, the, earthquakes, of, revolutionary, change, tocqueville, had, supported, cavaignac, against, louis, napol, on, bonaparte, for, the, presidential, election, of, 1848, opposed, to, louis, napol, on, bonaparte, s, 2, december, 1851, coup, which, followed, his, election, tocqueville, was, among, the, deputies, who, gathered, at, the, 10th, arrondissement, of, paris, in, an, attempt, to, resist, the, coup, and, have, napoleon, iii, judged, for, high, treason, as, he, had, violated, the, constitutional, limit, on, terms, of, office, detained, at, vincennes, and, then, released, tocqueville, who, supported, the, restoration, of, the, bourbons, against, napoleon, iii, s, second, empire, 1851, 1871, quit, political, life, and, retreated, to, his, castle, ch, teau, de, tocqueville, against, this, image, of, tocqueville, biographer, joseph, epstein, has, concluded, tocqueville, could, never, bring, himself, to, serve, a, man, he, considered, a, usurper, and, despot, he, fought, as, best, he, could, for, the, political, liberty, in, which, he, so, ardently, believed, had, given, it, in, all, thirteen, years, of, his, life, he, would, spend, the, days, remaining, to, him, fighting, the, same, fight, but, conducting, it, now, from, libraries, archives, and, his, own, desk, there, he, began, the, draft, of, l, ancien, r, gime, et, la, r, volution, publishing, the, first, tome, in, 1856, but, leaving, the, second, one, unfinished, a, longtime, sufferer, from, bouts, of, tuberculosis, tocqueville, would, eventually, succumb, to, the, disease, on, 16, april, 1859, and, was, buried, in, the, tocqueville, cemetery, in, normandy, tocqueville, s, professed, religion, was, roman, catholicism, he, saw, religion, as, being, compatible, with, both, equality, and, individualism, but, felt, that, religion, would, be, strongest, when, separated, from, politics, in, democracy, in, america, published, in, 1835, tocqueville, wrote, of, the, new, world, and, its, burgeoning, democratic, order, observing, from, the, perspective, of, a, detached, social, scientist, tocqueville, wrote, of, his, travels, through, the, united, states, in, the, early, 19th, century, when, the, market, revolution, western, expansion, and, jacksonian, democracy, were, radically, transforming, the, fabric, of, american, life, according, to, political, scientist, joshua, kaplan, one, purpose, of, writing, democracy, in, america, was, to, help, the, people, of, france, get, a, better, understanding, of, their, position, between, a, fading, aristocratic, order, and, an, emerging, democratic, order, and, to, help, them, sort, out, the, confusion, tocqueville, saw, democracy, as, an, enterprise, that, balanced, liberty, and, equality, concern, for, the, individual, as, well, as, for, the, community, however, on, a, negative, note, tocqueville, remarked, that, in, democracies, manners, are, never, so, refined, as, amongst, aristocratic, nations, tocqueville, was, an, ardent, supporter, of, liberty, i, have, a, passionate, love, for, liberty, law, and, respect, for, rights, he, wrote, i, am, neither, of, the, revolutionary, party, nor, of, the, conservative, liberty, is, my, foremost, passion, he, wrote, of, political, consequences, of, the, social, state, of, the, anglo, americans, by, saying, but, one, also, finds, in, the, human, heart, a, depraved, taste, for, equality, which, impels, the, weak, to, want, to, bring, the, strong, down, to, their, level, and, which, reduces, men, to, preferring, equality, in, servitude, to, inequality, in, freedom, the, above, is, often, misquoted, as, a, slavery, quote, because, of, previous, translations, of, the, french, text, the, most, recent, translation, by, arthur, goldhammer, in, 2004, translates, the, meaning, to, be, as, stated, above, examples, of, misquoted, sources, are, numerous, on, the, internet, such, as, americans, are, so, enamored, of, equality, that, they, would, rather, be, equal, in, slavery, than, unequal, in, freedom, but, the, text, does, not, contain, the, words, americans, were, so, enamored, by, equality, anywhere, his, view, on, government, reflects, his, belief, in, liberty, and, the, need, for, individuals, to, be, able, to, act, freely, while, respecting, others, rights, of, centralized, government, he, wrote, that, it, excels, in, preventing, not, doing, tocqueville, continues, to, comment, on, equality, by, saying, furthermore, when, citizens, are, all, almost, equal, it, becomes, difficult, for, them, to, defend, their, independence, against, the, aggressions, of, power, as, none, of, them, is, strong, enough, to, fight, alone, with, advantage, the, only, guarantee, of, liberty, is, for, everyone, to, combine, forces, but, such, a, combination, is, not, always, in, evidence, tocqueville, explicitly, cites, inequality, as, being, incentive, for, the, poor, to, become, rich, and, notes, that, it, is, not, often, that, two, generations, within, a, family, maintain, success, and, that, it, is, inheritance, laws, that, split, and, eventually, break, apart, someone, s, estate, that, cause, a, constant, cycle, of, churn, between, the, poor, and, the, rich, thereby, over, generations, making, the, poor, rich, and, the, rich, poor, he, cites, protective, laws, in, france, at, the, time, that, protected, an, estate, from, being, split, apart, among, heirs, thereby, preserving, wealth, and, preventing, a, churn, of, wealth, such, as, was, perceived, by, him, in, 1835, within, the, united, states, former, former, tocqueville, s, main, purpose, was, to, analyze, the, functioning, of, political, society, and, various, forms, of, political, associations, although, he, brought, some, reflections, on, civil, society, too, and, relations, between, political, and, civil, society, for, tocqueville, as, for, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, and, karl, marx, civil, society, was, a, sphere, of, private, entrepreneurship, and, civilian, affairs, regulated, by, civil, code, as, a, critic, of, individualism, tocqueville, thought, that, through, associating, for, mutual, purpose, both, in, public, and, private, americans, are, able, to, overcome, selfish, desires, thus, making, both, a, self, conscious, and, active, political, society, and, a, vibrant, civil, society, functioning, according, to, political, and, civil, laws, of, the, state, according, to, political, scientist, joshua, kaplan, tocqueville, did, not, originate, the, concept, of, individualism, instead, he, changed, its, meaning, and, saw, it, as, a, calm, and, considered, feeling, which, disposes, each, citizen, to, isolate, himself, from, the, mass, of, his, fellows, and, to, withdraw, into, the, circle, of, family, and, friends, ith, this, little, society, formed, to, his, taste, he, gladly, leaves, the, greater, society, to, look, for, itself, while, tocqueville, saw, egotism, and, selfishness, as, vices, he, saw, individualism, as, not, a, failure, of, feeling, but, as, a, way, of, thinking, about, things, which, could, have, either, positive, consequences, such, as, a, willingness, to, work, together, or, negative, consequences, such, as, isolation, and, that, individualism, could, be, remedied, by, improved, understanding, when, individualism, was, a, positive, force, and, prompted, people, to, work, together, for, common, purposes, and, seen, as, self, interest, properly, understood, then, it, helped, to, counterbalance, the, danger, of, the, tyranny, of, the, majority, since, people, could, take, control, over, their, own, lives, without, government, aid, according, to, kaplan, americans, have, a, difficult, time, accepting, tocqueville, s, criticism, of, the, stifling, intellectual, effect, of, the, omnipotence, of, the, majority, and, that, americans, tend, to, deny, that, there, is, a, problem, in, this, regard, others, such, as, the, catholic, writer, daniel, schwindt, disagree, with, kaplan, s, interpretation, arguing, instead, that, tocqueville, saw, individualism, as, just, another, form, of, egotism, and, not, an, improvement, over, it, to, make, his, case, schwindt, provides, citations, such, as, the, following, egoism, springs, from, a, blind, instinct, individualism, from, wrong, headed, thinking, rather, than, from, depraved, feelings, it, originates, as, much, from, defects, of, intelligence, as, from, the, mistakes, of, the, heart, egoism, blights, the, seeds, of, every, virtue, individualism, at, first, dries, up, only, the, source, of, public, virtue, in, the, longer, term, it, attacks, and, destroys, all, the, others, and, will, finally, merge, with, egoism, defunct, defunct, tocqueville, warned, that, modern, democracy, may, be, adept, at, inventing, new, forms, of, tyranny, because, radical, equality, could, lead, to, the, materialism, of, an, expanding, bourgeoisie, and, to, the, selfishness, of, individualism, in, such, conditions, we, might, become, so, enamored, with, a, relaxed, love, of, present, enjoyments, that, we, lose, interest, in, the, future, of, our, descendants, and, meekly, allow, ourselves, to, be, led, in, ignorance, by, a, despotic, force, all, the, more, powerful, because, it, does, not, resemble, one, wrote, the, new, yorker, s, james, wood, tocqueville, worried, that, if, despotism, were, to, take, root, in, a, modern, democracy, it, would, be, a, much, more, dangerous, version, than, the, oppression, under, the, roman, emperors, or, tyrants, of, the, past, who, could, only, exert, a, pernicious, influence, on, a, small, group, of, people, at, a, time, in, contrast, a, despotism, under, a, democracy, could, see, a, multitude, of, men, uniformly, alike, equal, constantly, circling, for, petty, pleasures, unaware, of, fellow, citizens, and, subject, to, the, will, of, a, powerful, state, which, exerted, an, immense, protective, power, tocqueville, compared, a, potentially, despotic, democratic, government, to, a, protective, parent, who, wants, to, keep, its, citizens, children, as, perpetual, children, and, which, does, not, break, men, s, wills, but, rather, guides, it, and, presides, over, people, in, the, same, way, as, a, shepherd, looking, after, a, flock, of, timid, animals, tocqueville, s, penetrating, analysis, sought, to, understand, the, peculiar, nature, of, american, political, life, in, describing, the, american, he, agreed, with, thinkers, such, as, aristotle, and, montesquieu, that, the, balance, of, property, determined, the, balance, of, political, power, but, his, conclusions, after, that, differed, radically, from, those, of, his, predecessors, tocqueville, tried, to, understand, why, the, united, states, was, so, different, from, europe, in, the, last, throes, of, aristocracy, in, contrast, to, the, aristocratic, ethic, the, united, states, was, a, society, where, hard, work, and, money, making, was, the, dominant, ethic, where, the, common, man, enjoyed, a, level, of, dignity, which, was, unprecedented, where, commoners, never, deferred, to, elites, and, where, what, he, described, as, crass, individualism, and, market, capitalism, had, taken, root, to, an, extraordinary, degree, tocqueville, writes, among, a, democratic, people, where, there, is, no, hereditary, wealth, every, man, works, to, earn, a, living, labor, is, held, in, honor, the, prejudice, is, not, against, but, in, its, favor, tocqueville, asserted, that, the, values, that, had, triumphed, in, the, north, and, were, present, in, the, south, had, begun, to, suffocate, old, world, ethics, and, social, arrangements, legislatures, abolished, primogeniture, and, entails, resulting, in, more, widely, distributed, land, holdings, this, was, a, contrast, to, the, general, aristocratic, pattern, in, which, only, the, eldest, child, usually, a, man, inherited, the, estate, which, had, the, effect, of, keeping, large, estates, intact, from, generation, to, generation, in, contrast, landed, elites, in, the, united, states, were, less, likely, to, pass, on, fortunes, to, a, single, child, by, the, action, of, primogeniture, which, meant, that, as, time, went, by, large, estates, became, broken, up, within, a, few, generations, which, in, turn, made, the, children, more, equal, overall, according, to, joshua, kaplan, s, tocqueville, it, was, not, always, a, negative, development, since, bonds, of, affection, and, shared, experience, between, children, often, replaced, the, more, formal, relation, between, the, eldest, child, and, the, siblings, characteristic, of, the, previous, aristocratic, pattern, overall, hereditary, fortunes, in, the, new, democracies, became, exceedingly, difficult, to, secure, and, more, people, were, forced, to, struggle, for, their, own, living, as, tocqueville, understood, it, this, rapidly, democratizing, society, had, a, population, devoted, to, middling, values, which, wanted, to, amass, through, hard, work, vast, fortunes, in, tocqueville, s, mind, this, explained, why, the, united, states, was, so, different, from, europe, in, europe, he, claimed, nobody, cared, about, making, money, the, lower, classes, had, no, hope, of, gaining, more, than, minimal, wealth, while, the, upper, classes, found, it, crass, vulgar, and, unbecoming, of, their, sort, to, care, about, something, as, unseemly, as, money, and, many, were, virtually, guaranteed, wealth, and, took, it, for, granted, at, the, same, time, in, the, united, states, workers, would, see, people, fashioned, in, exquisite, attire, and, merely, proclaim, that, through, hard, work, they, too, would, soon, possess, the, fortune, necessary, to, enjoy, such, luxuries, despite, maintaining, that, the, balance, of, property, determined, the, balance, of, power, tocqueville, argued, that, as, the, united, states, showed, equitable, property, holdings, did, not, ensure, the, rule, of, the, best, men, in, fact, it, did, quite, the, opposite, as, the, widespread, relatively, equitable, property, ownership, which, distinguished, the, united, states, and, determined, its, mores, and, values, also, explained, why, the, united, states, masses, held, elites, in, such, contempt, beyond, the, eradication, of, old, world, aristocracy, ordinary, americans, also, refused, to, defer, to, those, possessing, as, tocqueville, put, it, superior, talent, and, intelligence, and, these, natural, elites, could, not, enjoy, much, share, in, political, power, as, a, result, ordinary, americans, enjoyed, too, much, power, and, claimed, too, great, a, voice, in, the, public, sphere, to, defer, to, intellectual, superiors, this, culture, promoted, a, relatively, pronounced, equality, tocqueville, argued, but, the, same, mores, and, opinions, that, ensured, such, equality, also, promoted, mediocrity, those, who, possessed, true, virtue, and, talent, were, left, with, limited, choices, tocqueville, said, that, those, with, the, most, education, and, intelligence, were, left, with, two, choices, they, could, join, limited, intellectual, circles, to, explore, the, weighty, and, complex, problems, facing, society, or, they, could, use, their, superior, talents, to, amass, vast, fortunes, in, the, private, sector, he, wrote, that, he, did, not, know, of, any, country, where, there, was, less, independence, of, mind, and, true, freedom, of, discussion, than, in, america, tocqueville, blamed, the, omnipotence, of, majority, rule, as, a, chief, factor, in, stifling, thinking, the, majority, has, enclosed, thought, within, a, formidable, fence, a, writer, is, free, inside, that, area, but, woe, to, the, man, who, goes, beyond, it, not, that, he, stands, in, fear, of, an, inquisition, but, he, must, face, all, kinds, of, unpleasantness, in, every, day, persecution, a, career, in, politics, is, closed, to, him, for, he, has, offended, the, only, power, that, holds, the, keys, according, to, kaplan, s, interpretation, of, tocqueville, he, argued, in, contrast, to, previous, political, thinkers, that, a, serious, problem, in, political, life, was, not, that, people, were, too, strong, but, that, people, were, too, weak, and, felt, powerless, as, the, danger, is, that, people, felt, swept, up, in, something, that, they, could, not, control, uniquely, positioned, at, a, crossroads, in, american, history, tocqueville, s, democracy, in, america, attempted, to, capture, the, essence, of, american, culture, and, values, although, a, supporter, of, colonialism, tocqueville, could, clearly, perceive, the, evils, that, black, people, and, natives, had, been, subjected, to, in, the, united, states, tocqueville, devoted, the, last, chapter, of, the, first, volume, of, democracy, in, america, to, the, question, while, his, travel, companion, gustave, de, beaumont, wholly, focused, on, slavery, and, its, fallouts, for, the, american, nation, in, marie, or, slavery, in, america, tocqueville, notes, among, the, american, races, the, first, who, attracts, the, eye, the, first, in, enlightenment, in, power, and, in, happiness, is, the, white, man, the, european, man, par, excellence, below, him, appear, the, negro, and, the, indian, these, two, unfortunate, races, have, neither, birth, nor, face, nor, language, nor, mores, in, common, only, their, misfortunes, look, alike, both, occupy, an, equally, inferior, position, in, the, country, that, they, inhabit, both, experience, the, effects, of, tyranny, and, if, their, miseries, are, different, they, can, accuse, the, same, author, for, them, tocqueville, contrasted, the, settlers, of, virginia, with, the, middle, class, religious, puritans, who, founded, new, england, and, analyzed, the, debasing, influence, of, slavery, the, men, sent, to, virginia, were, seekers, of, gold, adventurers, without, resources, and, without, character, whose, turbulent, and, restless, spirit, endangered, the, infant, colony, artisans, and, agriculturalists, arrived, afterwards, hardly, in, any, respect, above, the, level, of, the, inferior, classes, in, england, no, lofty, views, no, spiritual, conception, presided, over, the, foundation, of, these, new, settlements, the, colony, was, scarcely, established, when, slavery, was, introduced, this, was, the, capital, fact, which, was, to, exercise, an, immense, influence, on, the, character, the, laws, and, the, whole, future, of, the, south, slavery, dishonors, labor, it, introduces, idleness, into, society, and, with, idleness, ignorance, and, pride, luxury, and, distress, it, enervates, the, powers, of, the, mind, and, benumbs, the, activity, of, man, on, this, same, english, foundation, there, developed, in, the, north, very, different, characteristics, tocqueville, concluded, that, return, of, the, black, population, to, africa, could, not, resolve, the, problem, as, he, writes, at, the, end, of, democracy, in, america, if, the, colony, of, liberia, were, able, to, receive, thousands, of, new, inhabitants, every, year, and, if, the, negroes, were, in, a, state, to, be, sent, thither, with, advantage, if, the, union, were, to, supply, the, society, with, annual, subsidies, and, to, transport, the, negroes, to, africa, in, government, vessels, it, would, still, be, unable, to, counterpoise, the, natural, increase, of, population, among, the, blacks, and, as, it, could, not, remove, as, many, men, in, a, year, as, are, born, upon, its, territory, within, that, time, it, could, not, prevent, the, growth, of, the, evil, which, is, daily, increasing, in, the, states, the, negro, race, will, never, leave, those, shores, of, the, american, continent, to, which, it, was, brought, by, the, passions, and, the, vices, of, europeans, and, it, will, not, disappear, from, the, new, world, as, long, as, it, continues, to, exist, the, inhabitants, of, the, united, states, may, retard, the, calamities, which, they, apprehend, but, they, cannot, now, destroy, their, efficient, cause, in, 1855, tocqueville, wrote, the, following, text, published, by, maria, weston, chapman, in, the, liberty, bell, testimony, against, slavery, i, do, not, think, it, is, for, me, a, foreigner, to, indicate, to, the, united, states, the, time, the, measures, or, the, men, by, whom, slavery, shall, be, abolished, still, as, the, persevering, enemy, of, despotism, everywhere, and, under, all, its, forms, i, am, pained, and, astonished, by, the, fact, that, the, freest, people, in, the, world, is, at, the, present, time, almost, the, only, one, among, civilized, and, christian, nations, which, yet, maintains, personal, servitude, and, this, while, serfdom, itself, is, about, disappearing, where, it, has, not, already, disappeared, from, the, most, degraded, nations, of, europe, an, old, and, sincere, friend, of, america, i, am, uneasy, at, seeing, slavery, retard, her, progress, tarnish, her, glory, furnish, arms, to, her, detractors, compromise, the, future, career, of, the, union, which, is, the, guaranty, of, her, safety, and, greatness, and, point, out, beforehand, to, her, to, all, her, enemies, the, spot, where, they, are, to, strike, as, a, man, too, i, am, moved, at, the, spectacle, of, man, s, degradation, by, man, and, i, hope, to, see, the, day, when, the, law, will, grant, equal, civil, liberty, to, all, the, inhabitants, of, the, same, empire, as, god, accords, the, freedom, of, the, will, without, distinction, to, the, dwellers, upon, earth, french, historian, of, colonialism, olivier, le, cour, grandmaison, argues, that, tocqueville, along, with, jules, michelet, was, ahead, of, his, time, in, his, use, of, the, term, extermination, to, describe, what, was, happening, during, the, colonization, of, western, united, states, and, the, indian, removal, period, according, to, tocqueville, assimilation, of, black, people, would, be, almost, impossible, and, this, was, already, being, demonstrated, in, the, northern, states, however, assimilation, was, the, best, solution, for, native, americans, and, since, they, were, too, proud, to, assimilate, they, would, inevitably, become, extinct, displacement, was, another, part, of, america, s, indian, policy, both, populations, were, undemocratic, or, without, the, qualities, intellectual, and, otherwise, needed, to, live, in, a, democracy, tocqueville, shared, many, views, on, assimilation, and, segregation, of, his, and, the, coming, epochs, but, he, opposed, arthur, de, gobineau, s, theories, as, found, in, the, inequality, of, human, races, 1853, 1855, in, his, democracy, in, america, tocqueville, also, forecast, the, preeminence, of, the, united, states, and, russia, as, the, two, main, global, powers, in, his, book, he, stated, there, are, now, two, great, nations, in, the, world, which, starting, from, different, points, seem, to, be, advancing, toward, the, same, goal, the, russians, and, the, anglo, americans, each, seems, called, by, some, secret, design, of, providence, one, day, to, hold, in, its, hands, the, destinies, of, half, the, world, tocqueville, believed, that, the, american, jury, system, was, particularly, important, in, educating, citizens, in, self, government, and, rule, of, law, he, often, expressed, how, the, civil, jury, system, was, one, of, the, most, effective, showcases, of, democracy, because, it, connected, citizens, with, the, true, spirit, of, the, justice, system, in, his, 1835, treatise, democracy, in, america, he, explained, the, jury, and, more, especially, the, civil, jury, serves, to, communicate, the, spirit, of, the, judges, to, the, minds, of, all, the, citizens, and, this, spirit, with, the, habits, which, attend, it, is, the, soundest, preparation, for, free, institutions, it, invests, each, citizen, with, a, kind, of, magistracy, it, makes, them, all, feel, the, duties, which, they, are, bound, to, discharge, toward, society, and, the, part, which, they, take, in, the, government, tocqueville, believed, that, jury, service, not, only, benefited, the, society, as, a, whole, but, enhanced, jurors, qualities, as, citizens, because, of, the, jury, system, they, were, better, informed, about, the, rule, of, law, and, they, were, more, closely, connected, to, the, state, thus, quite, independently, of, what, the, jury, contributed, to, dispute, resolution, participation, on, the, jury, had, salutary, effects, on, the, jurors, themselves, alexis, de, tocqueville, was, an, important, figure, in, the, colonization, of, algeria, a, member, of, french, parliament, during, the, french, conquest, of, algeria, and, subsequent, july, monarchy, tocqueville, took, it, upon, himself, to, become, an, expert, on, the, algeria, question, and, to, this, end, penned, a, number, of, discourses, and, letters, he, also, made, a, point, of, studying, islam, the, quran, and, the, arabic, language, in, order, to, better, understand, the, country, in, a, series, of, letters, penned, by, alexis, de, tocqueville, he, describes, the, situation, of, france, as, well, as, the, geography, and, society, of, algeria, at, the, time, suppose, that, the, emperor, of, china, landing, in, france, at, the, head, of, an, armed, power, should, make, himself, master, of, our, largest, cities, and, of, our, capital, that, after, having, burned, all, the, public, registers, before, suffering, to, read, them, and, having, destroyed, or, dispersed, all, of, the, civil, service, without, inquiring, into, their, various, attributions, he, should, finally, seize, every, functionary, from, the, head, of, the, government, to, the, campesino, guards, the, peers, the, deputies, and, in, general, the, whole, ruling, class, and, deport, them, all, at, once, to, some, distant, country, do, you, not, think, that, this, great, prince, in, spite, of, his, powerful, army, his, fortresses, and, his, treasures, will, soon, find, himself, extremely, unprepared, in, administering, the, conquered, country, that, his, new, subjects, deprived, of, all, those, who, conducted, or, could, conduct, affairs, of, state, will, be, unable, to, govern, themselves, while, he, coming, from, the, antipodes, knows, neither, the, religion, nor, the, language, nor, the, laws, nor, the, habits, nor, the, administrative, customs, of, the, country, and, who, has, taken, care, to, remove, all, those, who, could, have, instructed, him, in, them, will, be, in, no, state, rule, them, you, will, therefore, have, no, difficulty, in, foreseeing, that, if, the, parts, of, france, which, are, materially, occupied, by, the, victor, obey, him, the, rest, of, the, country, will, soon, be, given, over, to, an, immense, anarchy, despite, being, initially, critical, of, the, french, invasion, of, algeria, toccqueville, also, believed, that, geopolitical, necessities, of, the, time, would, not, allow, for, a, withdrawal, of, military, forces, for, two, reasons, first, his, understanding, of, the, international, situation, and, france, s, position, in, the, world, and, second, changes, in, french, society, tocqueville, believed, that, war, and, colonization, would, restore, national, pride, threatened, he, believed, by, the, gradual, softening, of, social, mores, in, the, middle, classes, their, taste, for, material, pleasures, was, spreading, to, the, whole, of, society, giving, it, an, example, of, weakness, and, egotism, tocqueville, expressed, himself, in, an, 1841, essay, concerning, the, conquest, of, algeria, in, which, he, called, for, a, dual, program, of, domination, and, colonization, for, my, part, i, have, brought, back, from, africa, the, distressing, notion, that, at, the, moment, we, are, waging, war, in, a, much, more, barbaric, manner, than, the, arabs, themselves, at, present, theirs, is, the, side, of, civilization, this, way, of, waging, war, seems, to, me, as, stupid, as, it, is, cruel, it, can, only, enter, into, the, crude, and, brutal, mind, of, a, soldier, it, was, not, worth, putting, displacing, the, turks, to, reproduce, that, which, in, them, deserved, the, detestation, of, the, world, that, even, from, the, point, of, view, of, interest, is, much, more, harmful, than, useful, because, as, another, officer, said, to, me, if, we, only, aim, to, equal, the, turks, we, will, be, by, the, fact, in, a, position, much, lower, than, them, barbarians, among, barbarians, the, turks, will, always, have, on, us, the, advantage, of, being, muslim, barbarians, it, is, thus, to, a, principle, superior, to, theirs, that, we, must, appeal, i, have, often, heard, in, france, men, whom, i, respect, but, whom, i, do, not, agree, with, say, that, it, wrong, to, burn, the, harvests, to, empty, the, silos, and, finally, to, imprison, unarmed, men, women, and, children, these, are, in, my, opinion, unfortunate, necessities, but, ones, to, which, any, people, who, want, to, make, war, on, the, arabs, will, be, obliged, to, submit, and, if, i, must, say, what, i, think, these, acts, do, not, revolt, me, more, or, even, as, much, as, several, others, which, the, law, of, war, obviously, authorizes, and, which, take, place, in, all, the, wars, of, europe, why, is, it, more, odious, to, burn, harvests, and, take, women, and, children, prisoner, than, to, bombard, the, harmless, population, of, a, besieged, city, or, to, seize, merchant, ships, belonging, to, the, subjects, of, an, enemy, power, at, sea, the, one, is, in, my, opinion, much, crueler, and, less, justifiable, than, the, other, applauding, the, methods, of, general, bugeaud, tocqueville, went, so, far, to, claim, that, war, in, africa, is, a, science, everyone, is, familiar, with, its, rules, and, everyone, can, apply, those, rules, with, almost, complete, certainty, of, success, one, of, the, greatest, services, that, field, marshal, bugeaud, has, rendered, his, country, is, to, have, spread, perfected, and, made, everyone, aware, of, this, new, science, tocqueville, advocated, racial, segregation, as, a, form, of, consociationalism, in, algeria, with, two, distinct, legislations, one, for, european, colonists, and, one, for, the, arab, population, without, doubt, it, would, be, as, dangerous, as, it, would, be, useless, to, try, to, suggest, to, them, our, morals, our, ideas, our, customs, it, is, not, in, the, direction, of, our, european, civilization, that, we, must, now, push, them, but, in, the, direction, of, their, own, civilization, we, must, ask, of, them, what, they, desire, and, not, what, they, despise, individual, property, industry, sedentary, living, are, not, contrary, to, the, religion, of, mohammed, arabs, have, known, or, know, these, things, elsewhere, they, are, appreciated, and, enjoyed, by, some, of, them, in, algeria, itself, why, should, we, despair, of, making, them, familiar, to, the, greatest, number, it, has, already, been, attempted, on, some, points, with, success, islam, is, not, absolutely, impenetrable, to, the, enlightenment, it, has, often, admitted, in, its, bosom, certain, sciences, or, certain, arts, why, should, we, not, try, to, make, these, flourish, under, our, empire, let, us, not, force, the, natives, to, come, to, our, schools, but, let, us, help, them, to, raise, theirs, to, multiply, those, who, teach, there, to, train, the, men, of, law, and, the, men, of, religion, of, whom, the, muslim, civilization, cannot, do, without, any, more, than, us, such, a, two, tier, arrangement, would, be, fully, realised, with, the, 1870, cr, mieux, decree, and, the, indigenousness, code, which, extended, french, citizenship, to, european, settlers, and, algerian, jews, whereas, muslim, algerians, would, be, governed, under, the, code, de, l, indig, nat, however, tocqueville, hoped, for, an, eventual, mixing, of, the, french, and, arab, populations, into, a, single, body, every, day, the, french, are, developing, clearer, and, more, accurate, notions, about, the, inhabitants, of, algeria, they, learn, their, languages, become, familiar, with, their, customs, and, one, even, sees, some, who, show, a, kind, of, unthinking, enthusiasm, for, them, on, the, other, hand, the, whole, of, the, young, arab, generation, in, algiers, speaks, our, language, and, has, already, taken, on, some, of, our, customs, there, is, therefore, no, reason, to, believe, that, time, cannot, succeed, in, amalgamating, the, two, races, god, does, not, prevent, it, only, the, faults, of, men, could, impede, it, in, opposition, to, olivier, le, cour, grandmaison, jean, louis, beno, t, said, that, given, the, extent, of, racial, prejudices, during, the, colonization, of, algeria, tocqueville, was, one, of, its, most, moderate, supporters, beno, t, said, that, it, was, wrong, to, assume, tocqueville, was, a, supporter, of, bugeaud, despite, his, 1841, apologetic, discourse, it, seems, that, tocqueville, modified, his, views, after, his, second, visit, to, algeria, in, 1846, as, he, criticized, bugeaud, s, desire, to, invade, kabylia, in, an, 1847, speech, to, the, assembly, although, tocqueville, had, favoured, retention, of, distinct, traditional, law, administrators, schools, and, so, on, for, arabs, who, had, come, under, french, control, he, compared, the, berber, tribes, of, kabylia, in, his, second, of, two, letters, on, algeria, 1837, to, rousseau, s, concept, of, the, noble, savage, stating, if, rousseau, had, known, the, kabyles, he, would, not, have, spouted, so, much, nonsense, about, the, caribbean, and, other, american, indians, he, would, have, looked, to, the, atlas, for, his, models, there, he, would, have, found, men, who, are, subject, to, a, kind, of, social, police, and, yet, almost, as, free, as, the, isolated, individual, who, enjoys, his, wild, independence, in, the, depths, of, the, woods, men, who, are, neither, rich, nor, poor, neither, servants, nor, masters, who, appoint, their, own, chiefs, and, scarcely, notice, that, they, have, chiefs, who, are, content, with, their, state, and, remain, in, it, tocqueville, s, views, on, the, matter, were, complex, although, in, his, 1841, report, on, algeria, he, applauded, bugeaud, for, making, war, in, a, way, that, defeated, abd, el, kader, s, resistance, he, had, advocated, in, the, two, letters, that, the, french, military, advance, leave, kabylia, undisturbed, and, in, subsequent, speeches, and, writings, he, continued, to, oppose, intrusion, into, kabylia, in, the, debate, about, the, 1846, extraordinary, funds, tocqueville, denounced, bugeaud, s, conduct, of, military, operations, and, succeeded, in, convincing, the, assembly, not, to, vote, funds, in, support, of, bugeaud, s, military, columns, tocqueville, considered, bugeaud, s, plan, to, invade, kabylia, despite, the, opposition, of, the, assembly, as, a, seditious, act, in, the, face, of, which, the, government, was, opting, for, cowardice, in, his, 1847, report, on, algeria, tocqueville, declared, that, europe, should, avoid, making, the, same, mistake, they, made, with, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, in, order, to, avoid, the, bloody, consequences, more, particularly, he, reminds, his, countrymen, of, a, solemn, caution, whereby, he, warns, them, that, if, the, methods, used, towards, the, algerian, people, remain, unchanged, colonization, will, end, in, a, blood, bath, tocqueville, includes, in, his, report, on, algeria, that, the, fate, of, their, soldiers, and, finances, depended, on, how, the, french, government, treats, the, various, native, populations, of, algeria, including, the, various, arab, tribes, independent, kabyles, living, in, the, atlas, mountains, and, the, powerful, political, leader, abd, el, kader, the, latter, stresses, the, obtainment, and, protection, of, land, and, passageways, that, promise, commercial, wealth, in, the, case, of, algeria, the, port, of, algiers, and, the, control, over, the, strait, of, gibraltar, were, considered, by, tocqueville, to, be, particularly, valuable, whereas, direct, control, of, the, political, operations, of, the, entirety, of, algeria, was, not, thus, the, author, stresses, domination, over, only, certain, points, of, political, influence, as, a, means, to, colonization, of, commercially, valuable, areas, tocqueville, argued, that, though, unpleasant, domination, via, violent, means, is, necessary, for, colonization, and, justified, by, the, laws, of, war, such, laws, are, not, discussed, in, detail, but, given, that, the, goal, of, the, french, mission, in, algeria, was, to, obtain, commercial, and, military, interest, as, opposed, to, self, defense, it, can, be, deduced, that, tocqueville, would, not, concur, with, just, war, theory, s, jus, ad, bellum, criteria, of, just, cause, further, given, that, tocqueville, approved, of, the, use, of, force, to, eliminate, civilian, housing, in, enemy, territory, his, approach, does, not, accord, with, just, war, theory, s, jus, in, bello, criteria, of, proportionality, and, discrimination, in, 1856, tocqueville, published, the, old, regime, and, the, revolution, the, book, analyzes, french, society, before, the, french, revolution, the, so, called, ancien, r, gime, and, investigates, the, forces, that, caused, the, revolution, tocqueville, was, quoted, in, several, chapters, of, toby, young, s, memoirs, how, to, lose, friends, and, alienate, people, to, explain, his, observation, of, widespread, homogeneity, of, thought, even, amongst, intellectual, elites, at, harvard, university, during, his, time, spent, there, he, is, frequently, quoted, and, studied, in, american, history, classes, tocqueville, is, the, inspiration, for, australian, novelist, peter, carey, in, his, 2009, novel, parrot, and, olivier, in, america, tocqueville, and, his, memoir, recollections, are, mentioned, in, ada, palmer, s, novel, too, like, the, lightening, to, describe, someone, with, divided, loyalty
