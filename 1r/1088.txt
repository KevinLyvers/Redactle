georgian, golden, age, a, member, of, the, bagrationi, dynasty, her, position, as, the, first, woman, to, rule, georgia, in, her, own, right, was, emphasized, by, the, title, mepe, king, afforded, to, tamar, in, the, medieval, georgian, sources, tamar, was, proclaimed, heir, and, co, ruler, by, her, reigning, father, george, iii, in, 1178, but, she, faced, significant, opposition, from, the, aristocracy, upon, her, ascension, to, full, ruling, powers, after, george, s, death, tamar, was, successful, in, neutralizing, this, opposition, and, embarked, on, an, energetic, foreign, policy, aided, by, the, decline, of, the, hostile, seljuk, turks, relying, on, a, powerful, military, elite, tamar, was, able, to, build, on, the, successes, of, her, predecessors, to, consolidate, an, empire, which, dominated, the, caucasus, until, its, collapse, under, the, mongol, attacks, within, two, decades, after, tamar, s, death, tamar, was, married, twice, her, first, union, being, from, 1185, to, 1187, to, the, prince, yuri, of, the, grand, principality, of, vladimir, whom, she, divorced, and, expelled, from, the, country, defeating, his, subsequent, coup, attempts, for, her, second, husband, tamar, chose, in, 1191, the, alan, prince, david, soslan, by, whom, she, had, two, children, george, and, rusudan, the, two, successive, monarchs, on, the, throne, of, georgia, tamar, s, reign, is, associated, with, a, period, of, marked, political, and, military, successes, and, cultural, achievements, this, combined, with, her, role, as, a, female, ruler, has, contributed, to, her, status, as, an, idealized, and, romanticized, figure, in, georgian, arts, and, historical, memory, she, remains, an, important, symbol, in, georgian, popular, culture, tamar, was, born, in, circa, 1160, to, george, iii, king, of, georgia, and, his, consort, burdukhan, a, daughter, of, the, king, of, alania, while, it, is, possible, that, tamar, had, a, younger, sister, rusudan, she, is, only, mentioned, once, in, all, contemporary, accounts, of, tamar, s, reign, the, name, tamar, is, of, hebrew, origin, and, like, other, biblical, names, was, favored, by, the, georgian, bagrationi, dynasty, because, of, their, claim, to, be, descended, from, david, the, second, king, of, israel, tamar, s, youth, coincided, with, a, major, upheaval, in, georgia, in, 1177, her, father, george, iii, was, confronted, by, a, rebellious, faction, of, nobles, the, rebels, intended, to, dethrone, george, in, favor, of, the, king, s, fraternal, nephew, demna, who, was, considered, by, many, to, be, a, legitimate, royal, heir, of, his, murdered, father, david, v, demna, s, cause, was, little, but, a, pretext, for, the, nobles, led, by, the, pretender, s, father, in, law, the, amirspasalar, high, constable, ivane, ii, orbeli, to, weaken, the, crown, george, iii, was, able, to, crush, the, revolt, and, embarked, on, a, crackdown, campaign, on, the, defiant, aristocratic, clans, ivane, orbeli, was, put, to, death, and, the, surviving, members, of, his, family, were, driven, out, of, georgia, demna, castrated, and, blinded, on, his, uncle, s, order, did, not, survive, the, mutilation, and, soon, died, in, prison, once, the, rebellion, was, suppressed, and, the, pretender, eliminated, george, went, ahead, to, co, opt, tamar, into, government, with, him, and, crowned, her, as, co, ruler, in, 1178, by, doing, so, the, king, attempted, to, preempt, any, dispute, after, his, death, and, legitimize, his, line, on, the, throne, of, georgia, at, the, same, time, he, raised, men, from, the, kipchaks, as, well, as, from, the, gentry, and, unranked, classes, to, keep, the, dynastic, aristocracy, away, from, the, center, of, power, for, six, years, tamar, was, a, co, ruler, with, her, father, upon, whose, death, in, 1184, tamar, continued, as, the, sole, monarch, and, was, crowned, a, second, time, at, the, gelati, cathedral, near, kutaisi, western, georgia, she, inherited, a, relatively, strong, kingdom, but, the, centrifugal, tendencies, fostered, by, the, great, nobles, were, far, from, being, quelled, there, was, considerable, opposition, to, tamar, s, succession, this, was, sparked, by, a, reaction, against, the, repressive, policies, of, her, father, and, encouraged, by, the, new, sovereign, s, other, perceived, weakness, her, sex, as, georgia, had, never, previously, had, a, female, ruler, a, part, of, the, aristocracy, questioned, tamar, s, legitimacy, while, others, tried, to, exploit, her, youth, and, supposed, weakness, to, assert, greater, autonomy, for, themselves, the, energetic, involvement, of, tamar, s, influential, aunt, rusudan, and, the, catholicos, patriarch, michael, iv, was, crucial, for, legitimizing, tamar, s, succession, to, the, throne, however, the, young, queen, was, forced, into, making, significant, concessions, to, the, aristocracy, she, had, to, reward, the, catholicos, patriarch, michael, s, support, by, making, him, a, chancellor, thus, placing, him, at, the, top, of, both, the, clerical, and, secular, hierarchies, tamar, was, also, pressured, into, dismissing, her, father, s, appointees, among, them, the, constable, kubasar, a, georgian, kipchak, of, ignoble, birth, who, had, helped, george, iii, in, his, crackdown, on, the, defiant, nobility, one, of, the, few, untitled, servitors, of, george, iii, to, escape, this, fate, was, the, treasurer, qutlu, arslan, who, now, led, a, group, of, nobles, and, wealthy, citizens, in, a, struggle, to, limit, the, royal, authority, by, creating, a, new, council, karavi, whose, members, would, alone, deliberate, and, decide, policy, this, attempt, at, feudal, constitutionalism, was, rendered, abortive, when, tamar, had, qutlu, arslan, arrested, and, his, supporters, were, inveigled, into, submission, yet, tamar, s, first, moves, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, aristocratic, lite, were, unsuccessful, she, failed, in, her, attempt, to, use, a, church, synod, to, dismiss, the, catholicos, patriarch, michael, and, the, noble, council, darbazi, asserted, the, right, to, approve, royal, decrees, queen, tamar, s, marriage, was, a, question, of, state, importance, pursuant, to, dynastic, imperatives, and, the, ethos, of, the, time, the, nobles, required, tamar, to, marry, in, order, to, have, a, leader, for, the, army, and, to, provide, an, heir, to, the, throne, every, group, strove, to, select, and, secure, the, acceptance, of, its, candidate, in, order, to, strengthen, its, position, and, influence, at, court, two, main, factions, fought, for, the, influence, in, tamar, s, court, the, clans, of, mkhargrdzeli, and, abulasan, the, faction, of, the, abulasan, won, the, choice, was, approved, by, tamar, s, aunt, rusudan, and, council, of, feudal, lords, their, choice, fell, on, yuri, son, of, the, murdered, prince, andrei, i, bogolyubsky, of, vladimir, suzdal, who, later, lived, as, a, refugee, among, the, kipchaks, of, the, north, caucasus, they, called, an, influential, person, in, the, kingdom, the, great, merchant, zankan, zorababeli, he, was, given, the, mission, of, bringing, the, bridegroom, to, tbilisi, he, fulfilled, his, mission, with, zeal, and, the, prince, was, brought, to, georgia, to, marry, the, queen, in, 1185, the, young, man, valiant, perfect, of, body, and, pleasant, to, behold, yuri, proved, to, be, an, able, soldier, but, a, difficult, person, and, he, soon, ran, afoul, of, his, wife, the, strained, spousal, relations, paralleled, a, factional, struggle, at, the, royal, court, in, which, tamar, was, becoming, more, and, more, assertive, of, her, rights, as, a, queen, regnant, the, turning, point, in, tamar, s, fortunes, came, with, the, death, of, the, powerful, catholicos, patriarch, michael, whom, the, queen, replaced, as, a, chancellor, with, her, supporter, anton, gnolistavisdze, tamar, gradually, expanded, her, own, power, base, and, elevated, her, loyal, nobles, to, high, positions, at, the, court, most, notably, the, mkhargrdzeli, in, 1187, tamar, persuaded, the, noble, council, to, approve, her, to, divorce, yuri, who, was, accused, of, addiction, to, drunkenness, and, sodomy, and, was, sent, off, to, constantinople, assisted, by, several, georgian, aristocrats, anxious, to, check, tamar, s, growing, power, yuri, made, two, coup, attempts, but, failed, and, went, off, to, obscurity, after, 1191, the, queen, chose, her, second, husband, herself, he, was, david, soslan, an, alan, prince, to, whom, the, 18th, century, georgian, scholar, prince, vakhushti, ascribes, descent, from, the, early, 11th, century, georgian, king, george, i, david, a, capable, military, commander, became, tamar, s, major, supporter, and, was, instrumental, in, defeating, the, rebellious, nobles, who, rallied, behind, yuri, tamar, and, david, had, two, children, in, 1192, or, 1194, the, queen, gave, birth, to, a, son, george, lasha, the, future, king, george, iv, the, daughter, rusudan, was, born, c, 1195, and, would, succeed, her, brother, as, a, sovereign, of, georgia, david, soslan, s, status, of, a, king, consort, as, well, as, his, presence, in, art, on, charters, and, on, coins, was, dictated, by, the, necessity, of, male, aspects, of, kingship, but, he, remained, a, subordinate, ruler, who, shared, the, throne, with, and, derived, his, power, from, tamar, tamar, continued, to, be, styled, as, mep, et, a, mep, e, king, of, kings, in, georgian, a, language, with, no, grammatical, genders, mep, e, king, does, not, necessarily, imply, a, masculine, connotation, and, can, be, rendered, as, a, sovereign, the, female, equivalent, of, mep, e, is, dedop, ali, queen, which, was, applied, to, wives, or, other, senior, female, relatives, of, kings, tamar, is, occasionally, called, dedop, ali, and, dedop, alt, a, dedop, ali, in, the, georgian, chronicles, and, on, some, charters, thus, the, title, of, mep, e, might, have, been, applied, to, tamar, to, mark, out, her, unique, position, among, women, once, tamar, succeeded, in, consolidating, her, power, and, found, a, reliable, support, in, david, soslan, the, mkhargrdzeli, toreli, and, other, noble, families, she, revived, the, expansionist, foreign, policy, of, her, predecessors, repeated, occasions, of, dynastic, strife, in, georgia, combined, with, the, efforts, of, regional, successors, of, the, seljuk, empire, such, as, the, eldiguzids, shirvanshahs, and, ahlatshahs, had, slowed, down, the, dynamic, of, the, georgians, achieved, during, the, reigns, of, tamar, s, great, grandfather, david, iv, and, her, father, george, iii, however, the, georgians, became, again, active, under, tamar, more, prominently, in, the, second, decade, of, her, rule, early, in, the, 1190s, the, georgian, government, began, to, interfere, in, the, affairs, of, the, eldiguzids, and, of, the, shirvanshahs, aiding, rivaling, local, princes, and, reducing, shirvan, to, a, tributary, state, the, eldiguzid, atabeg, abu, bakr, attempted, to, stem, the, georgian, advance, but, suffered, a, defeat, at, the, hands, of, david, soslan, at, the, battle, of, shamkor, and, lost, his, capital, to, a, georgian, prot, g, in, 1195, although, abu, bakr, was, able, to, resume, his, reign, a, year, later, the, eldiguzids, were, only, barely, able, to, contain, further, georgian, forays, the, question, of, the, liberation, of, armenia, remained, of, prime, importance, in, georgia, s, foreign, policy, tamar, s, armies, led, by, two, armenian, generals, zakare, and, ivane, mkhargrdzeli, zakarian, overran, fortresses, and, cities, towards, the, ararat, plain, reclaiming, one, after, another, fortresses, and, districts, from, local, muslim, rulers, alarmed, by, the, georgian, successes, s, leymanshah, ii, the, resurgent, seljuqid, sultan, of, r, m, rallied, his, vassal, emirs, and, marched, against, georgia, but, his, camp, was, attacked, and, destroyed, by, david, soslan, at, the, battle, of, basian, in, 1203, or, 1204, the, chronicler, of, tamar, describes, how, the, army, was, assembled, at, the, rock, hewn, town, of, vardzia, before, marching, on, to, basian, and, how, the, queen, addressed, the, troops, from, the, balcony, of, the, church, exploiting, her, success, in, this, battle, between, 1203, and, 1205, georgians, seized, the, town, of, dvin, and, entered, ahlatshah, possessions, twice, and, subdued, the, emir, of, kars, vassal, of, the, saltukids, in, erzurum, the, ahlatshahs, and, the, emirs, of, erzurum, and, erzincan, in, 1206, the, georgian, army, under, the, command, of, david, soslan, captured, kars, and, other, fortresses, and, strongholds, along, the, araxes, this, campaign, was, evidently, started, because, the, ruler, of, erzerum, refused, to, submit, to, georgia, the, emir, of, kars, requested, aid, from, the, ahlatshahs, but, the, latter, was, unable, to, respond, it, was, soon, taken, over, by, the, ayyubid, sultanate, in, 1207, by, 1209, georgia, challenged, ayyubid, rule, in, eastern, anatolia, and, led, a, liberation, war, for, south, armenia, the, georgian, army, besieged, khlat, in, response, ayyubid, sultan, al, adil, i, assembled, and, personally, led, a, large, muslim, army, that, included, the, emirs, of, homs, hama, and, baalbek, as, well, as, contingents, from, other, ayyubid, principalities, to, support, al, awhad, emir, of, jazira, during, the, siege, georgian, general, ivane, mkhargrdzeli, accidentally, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, al, awhad, on, the, outskirts, of, ahlat, using, ivane, as, a, bargaining, chip, al, awhad, agreed, to, release, him, in, return, for, a, thirty, year, truce, with, georgia, thus, ending, the, immediate, georgian, threat, to, the, ayyubids, this, brought, the, struggle, for, the, armenian, lands, to, a, stall, leaving, the, lake, van, region, to, the, ayyubids, of, damascus, in, 1209, starting, the, eldiguzid, campaign, of, tamar, of, georgia, the, brothers, mkhargrzeli, laid, waste, to, ardabil, according, to, the, georgian, and, armenian, annals, as, a, revenge, for, the, local, muslim, ruler, s, attack, on, ani, and, his, massacre, of, the, city, s, christian, population, in, a, great, final, burst, the, brothers, led, an, army, marshaled, throughout, tamar, s, possessions, and, vassal, territories, in, a, march, through, nakhchivan, and, julfa, to, marand, tabriz, and, qazvin, in, northwest, iran, pillaging, several, settlements, on, their, way, georgians, reached, countries, where, nobody, had, heard, of, either, their, name, or, existence, among, the, remarkable, events, of, tamar, s, reign, was, the, foundation, of, the, empire, of, trebizond, on, the, black, sea, coast, in, 1204, this, state, was, established, by, alexios, i, megas, komnenos, r, 1204, 1222, and, his, brother, david, in, the, northeastern, pontic, provinces, of, the, crumbling, byzantine, empire, with, the, aid, of, georgian, troops, alexios, and, david, tamar, s, relatives, were, fugitive, byzantine, princes, raised, at, the, georgian, court, according, to, tamar, s, historian, the, aim, of, the, georgian, expedition, to, trebizond, was, to, punish, the, byzantine, emperor, alexios, iv, angelos, r, 1203, 1204, for, his, confiscation, of, a, shipment, of, money, from, the, georgian, queen, to, the, monasteries, of, antioch, and, mount, athos, however, tamar, s, pontic, endeavor, can, better, be, explained, by, her, desire, to, take, advantage, of, the, western, european, fourth, crusade, against, constantinople, to, set, up, a, friendly, state, in, georgia, s, immediate, southwestern, neighborhood, as, well, as, by, the, dynastic, solidarity, to, the, dispossessed, komnenoi, tamar, sought, to, make, use, of, the, weakness, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, crusaders, defeat, at, the, hands, of, the, ayyubid, sultan, saladin, in, order, to, gain, georgia, s, position, on, the, international, stage, and, to, assume, the, traditional, role, of, the, byzantine, crown, as, a, protector, of, the, christians, of, the, middle, east, christian, georgian, missionaries, were, active, in, the, north, caucasus, and, the, expatriate, monastic, communities, were, scattered, throughout, the, eastern, mediterranean, tamar, s, chronicle, praises, her, universal, protection, of, christianity, and, her, support, of, churches, and, monasteries, from, egypt, to, bulgaria, and, cyprus, the, georgian, court, was, primarily, concerned, with, the, protection, of, the, georgian, monastic, centers, in, the, holy, land, by, the, 12th, century, eight, georgian, monasteries, were, listed, in, jerusalem, saladin, s, biographer, bah, ad, d, n, ibn, add, d, reports, that, after, the, ayyubid, conquest, of, jerusalem, in, 1187, tamar, sent, envoys, to, the, sultan, to, request, that, the, confiscated, possessions, of, the, georgian, monasteries, in, jerusalem, be, returned, saladin, s, response, is, not, recorded, but, the, queen, s, efforts, seem, to, have, been, successful, jacques, de, vitry, who, attained, to, the, bishopric, of, acre, shortly, after, tamar, s, death, gives, further, evidence, of, the, georgians, presence, in, jerusalem, he, writes, that, the, georgians, were, in, contrast, to, the, other, christian, pilgrims, allowed, a, free, passage, into, the, city, with, their, banners, unfurled, ibn, add, d, furthermore, claims, that, tamar, outbid, the, byzantine, emperor, in, her, efforts, to, obtain, the, relics, of, the, true, cross, offering, 200, 000, gold, pieces, to, saladin, who, had, taken, the, relics, as, booty, at, the, battle, of, hattin, to, no, avail, however, georgia, s, political, and, cultural, exploits, of, tamar, s, epoch, were, rooted, in, a, long, and, complex, past, tamar, owed, her, accomplishments, most, immediately, to, the, reforms, of, her, great, grandfather, david, iv, r, 1089, 1125, and, more, remotely, to, the, unifying, efforts, of, david, iii, and, bagrat, iii, who, became, architects, of, a, political, unity, of, georgian, kingdoms, and, principalities, in, the, opening, decade, of, the, 11th, century, tamar, was, able, to, build, upon, their, successes, by, the, last, years, of, tamar, s, reign, the, georgian, state, had, reached, the, zenith, of, its, power, and, prestige, in, the, middle, ages, tamar, s, realm, stretched, from, the, greater, caucasus, crest, in, the, north, to, erzurum, in, the, south, and, from, the, zygii, in, the, northwest, to, the, vicinity, of, ganja, in, the, southeast, forming, a, pan, caucasian, empire, with, the, loyal, zachariad, regime, in, northern, and, central, armenia, shirvan, as, a, vassal, and, trebizond, as, an, ally, a, contemporary, georgian, historian, extols, tamar, as, the, master, of, the, lands, from, the, sea, of, pontus, to, the, sea, of, gurgan, from, speri, to, derbend, and, all, the, hither, and, the, thither, caucasus, up, to, khazaria, and, scythia, the, royal, title, was, correspondingly, aggrandized, it, now, reflected, not, only, tamar, s, sway, over, the, traditional, subdivisions, of, the, georgian, realm, but, also, included, new, components, emphasizing, the, georgian, crown, s, hegemony, over, the, neighboring, lands, thus, on, the, coins, and, charters, issued, in, her, name, tamar, is, identified, as, the, queen, never, achieved, autocratic, powers, and, the, noble, council, continued, to, function, however, tamar, s, own, prestige, and, the, expansion, of, patronq, moba, a, georgian, version, of, feudalism, kept, the, more, powerful, dynastic, princes, from, fragmenting, the, kingdom, this, period, marked, the, apex, of, georgian, feudalism, attempts, at, transplanting, feudal, practices, in, the, areas, where, they, had, previously, been, almost, unknown, did, not, pass, without, resistance, there, was, a, revolt, among, the, mountainers, of, pkhovi, and, dido, on, georgia, s, northeastern, frontier, in, 1212, which, was, put, down, by, ivane, mkhargrzeli, after, three, months, of, heavy, fighting, with, flourishing, commercial, centers, now, under, georgia, s, control, industry, and, commerce, brought, new, wealth, to, the, country, and, the, court, tribute, extracted, from, the, neighbors, and, war, booty, added, to, the, royal, treasury, giving, rise, to, the, saying, that, the, peasants, were, like, nobles, the, nobles, like, princes, and, the, princes, like, kings, with, this, prosperity, came, an, outburst, of, the, distinct, georgian, culture, emerging, from, the, amalgam, of, christian, secular, as, well, as, byzantine, and, iranian, influences, despite, this, the, georgians, continued, to, identify, with, the, byzantine, west, rather, than, islamic, east, with, the, georgian, monarchy, seeking, to, underscore, its, association, with, christianity, and, present, its, position, as, god, given, it, was, in, that, period, that, the, canon, of, georgian, orthodox, architecture, was, redesigned, and, a, series, of, large, scale, domed, cathedrals, were, built, the, byzantine, derived, expression, of, royal, power, was, modified, in, various, ways, to, bolster, tamar, s, unprecedented, position, as, a, woman, ruling, in, her, own, right, the, five, extant, monumental, church, portraits, of, the, queen, are, clearly, modeled, on, byzantine, imagery, but, also, highlight, specifically, georgian, themes, and, persian, type, ideals, of, female, beauty, despite, georgia, s, byzantine, leaning, culture, the, country, s, intimate, trade, connections, with, the, middle, east, is, evidenced, on, contemporary, georgian, coinage, whose, legends, were, composed, in, georgian, and, arabic, a, series, of, coins, minted, in, circa, 1200, in, the, name, of, queen, tamar, depicted, a, local, variant, of, the, byzantine, obverse, and, an, arabic, inscription, on, the, reverse, proclaiming, tamar, as, the, champion, of, the, messiah, the, contemporary, georgian, chronicles, enshrined, christian, morality, and, patristic, literature, continued, to, flourish, but, it, had, by, that, time, lost, its, earlier, dominant, position, to, secular, literature, which, was, highly, original, even, though, it, developed, close, contact, with, neighboring, cultures, the, trend, culminated, in, shota, rustaveli, s, epic, poem, the, knight, in, the, panther, s, skin, vepkhistq, aosani, which, celebrates, the, ideals, of, an, age, of, chivalry, and, is, revered, in, georgia, as, the, greatest, achievement, of, native, literature, tamar, outlived, her, consort, david, soslan, and, died, of, a, devastating, disease, not, far, from, her, capital, tbilisi, having, previously, crowned, her, son, lasha, giorgi, coregent, tamar, s, historian, relates, that, the, queen, suddenly, fell, ill, when, discussing, state, affairs, with, her, ministers, at, the, nacharmagevi, castle, near, the, town, of, gori, she, was, transported, to, tbilisi, and, later, to, the, nearby, castle, of, agarani, where, tamar, died, and, was, mourned, by, her, subjects, her, remains, were, transferred, to, the, cathedral, of, mtskheta, and, later, to, the, gelati, monastery, a, family, burial, ground, of, the, georgian, royal, dynasty, the, traditional, scholarly, opinion, is, that, tamar, died, in, 1213, although, there, are, several, indications, that, she, might, have, died, earlier, in, 1207, or, 1210, in, later, times, a, number, of, legends, emerged, about, tamar, s, place, of, burial, one, of, them, has, it, that, tamar, was, buried, in, a, secret, niche, at, the, gelati, monastery, so, as, to, prevent, the, grave, from, being, profaned, by, her, enemies, another, version, suggests, that, tamar, s, remains, were, reburied, in, a, remote, location, possibly, in, the, holy, land, the, french, knight, guillaume, de, bois, in, a, letter, dated, from, the, early, 13th, century, written, in, palestine, and, addressed, to, the, bishop, of, besan, on, claimed, that, he, had, heard, that, the, king, of, the, georgians, was, heading, towards, jerusalem, with, a, huge, army, and, had, already, conquered, many, cities, of, the, saracens, he, was, carrying, the, report, said, the, remains, of, his, mother, the, powerful, queen, tamar, regina, potentissima, thamar, who, had, been, unable, to, make, a, pilgrimage, to, the, holy, land, in, her, lifetime, and, had, bequeathed, her, body, to, be, buried, near, the, holy, sepulchre, in, the, 20th, century, the, quest, for, tamar, s, grave, became, a, subject, of, scholarly, research, as, well, as, the, focus, of, broader, public, interest, the, georgian, writer, grigol, robakidze, wrote, in, his, 1918, essay, on, tamar, thus, far, nobody, knows, where, tamar, s, grave, is, she, belongs, to, everyone, and, to, no, one, her, grave, is, in, the, heart, of, the, georgian, and, in, the, georgians, perception, this, is, not, a, grave, but, a, beautiful, vase, in, which, an, unfading, flower, the, great, tamar, flourishes, an, orthodox, academic, view, still, places, tamar, s, grave, at, gelati, but, a, series, of, archaeological, studies, beginning, with, taqaishvili, in, 1920, has, failed, to, locate, it, at, the, monastery, over, the, centuries, queen, tamar, has, emerged, as, a, dominant, figure, in, the, georgian, historical, pantheon, the, construction, of, her, reign, as, a, golden, age, began, in, the, reign, itself, and, tamar, became, the, focus, of, the, era, several, medieval, georgian, poets, including, shota, rustaveli, claimed, tamar, as, the, inspiration, for, their, works, a, legend, has, it, that, rustaveli, was, even, consumed, with, love, for, the, queen, and, ended, his, days, in, a, monastery, a, dramatic, scene, from, rustaveli, s, poem, where, the, seasoned, king, rostevan, crowns, his, daughter, tinatin, is, an, allegory, to, george, iii, s, co, option, of, tamar, rustaveli, comments, on, this, a, lion, cub, is, just, as, good, be, it, female, or, male, the, queen, became, a, subject, of, several, contemporary, panegyrics, such, as, chakhrukhadze, s, tamariani, and, ioane, shavteli, s, abdul, mesia, she, was, eulogized, in, the, chronicles, most, notably, in, the, two, accounts, centered, on, her, reign, the, life, of, tamar, queen, of, queens, and, the, histories, and, eulogies, of, the, sovereigns, which, became, the, primary, sources, of, tamar, s, sanctification, in, georgian, literature, the, chroniclers, exalt, her, as, a, protector, of, the, widowed, and, the, thrice, blessed, and, place, a, particular, emphasis, on, tamar, s, virtues, as, a, woman, beauty, humility, love, of, mercy, fidelity, and, purity, although, tamar, was, canonized, by, the, georgian, church, much, later, she, was, even, named, as, a, saint, in, her, lifetime, in, a, bilingual, greco, georgian, colophon, attached, to, the, manuscript, of, the, vani, gospels, the, idealization, of, tamar, was, further, accentuated, by, the, events, that, took, place, under, her, immediate, successors, within, two, decades, of, tamar, s, death, the, khwarezmian, and, mongol, invasions, brought, georgian, ascendancy, to, an, abrupt, end, later, periods, of, national, revival, were, too, ephemeral, to, match, the, achievements, of, tamar, s, reign, all, of, these, contributed, to, the, cult, of, tamar, which, blurred, the, distinction, between, the, idealized, queen, and, the, real, personality, in, popular, memory, tamar, s, image, has, acquired, a, legendary, and, romantic, fa, ade, a, diverse, set, of, folk, songs, poems, and, tales, illustrate, her, as, an, ideal, ruler, a, holy, woman, onto, whom, certain, attributes, of, pagan, deities, and, christian, saints, were, sometimes, projected, for, example, in, an, old, ossetian, legend, queen, tamar, conceives, her, son, through, a, sunbeam, which, shines, through, the, window, another, myth, from, the, georgian, mountains, equates, tamar, with, the, pagan, deity, of, weather, pirimze, who, controls, winter, similarly, in, the, highland, district, of, pshavi, tamar, s, image, fused, with, a, pagan, goddess, of, healing, and, female, fertility, while, tamar, occasionally, accompanied, her, army, and, is, described, as, planning, some, campaigns, she, was, never, directly, involved, in, the, fighting, yet, the, memory, of, the, military, victories, of, her, reign, contributed, to, tamar, s, other, popular, image, that, of, a, model, warrior, queen, it, also, echoed, in, the, tale, of, queen, dinara, a, popular, 16th, century, russian, story, about, a, fictional, georgian, queen, fighting, against, the, persians, tsar, of, all, the, russias, ivan, the, terrible, before, the, seizure, of, kazan, encouraged, his, army, by, the, examples, of, tamar, s, battles, by, describing, her, as, the, most, wise, queen, of, iberia, endowed, with, the, intelligence, and, courage, of, a, man, much, of, the, modern, perception, of, queen, tamar, was, shaped, under, the, influence, of, 19th, century, romanticism, and, growing, nationalism, among, georgian, intellectuals, of, that, time, in, the, russian, and, western, literatures, of, the, 19th, century, georgia, was, perceived, as, having, oriental, tendencies, thus, the, image, of, queen, tamar, reflected, some, of, these, western, conceptions, of, the, orient, and, the, characteristics, of, women, in, it, the, tyrolean, writer, jakob, philipp, fallmerayer, described, tamar, as, a, caucasian, semiramis, fascinated, by, the, exotic, caucasus, the, russian, poet, mikhail, lermontov, wrote, the, romantic, poem, tamara, russian, 1841, in, which, he, utilized, the, old, georgian, legend, about, a, siren, like, mountainous, princess, whom, the, poet, gave, the, name, of, queen, tamar, although, lermontov, s, depiction, of, the, georgian, queen, as, a, destructive, seductress, had, no, apparent, historical, background, it, has, been, influential, enough, to, raise, the, issue, of, tamar, s, sexuality, a, question, that, was, given, some, prominence, by, the, 19th, century, european, authors, knut, hamsun, s, 1903, play, queen, tamara, was, less, successful, the, theatre, critics, saw, in, it, a, modern, woman, dressed, in, a, medieval, costume, and, read, the, play, as, a, commentary, on, the, new, woman, of, the, 1890s, russian, conductor, mily, balakirev, composed, a, symphonic, poem, named, tamara, in, georgian, literature, tamar, was, also, romanticized, but, very, differently, from, the, russian, and, western, european, view, the, georgian, romanticists, followed, a, medieval, tradition, in, tamar, s, portrayal, as, a, gentle, saintly, woman, who, ruled, a, country, permanently, at, war, this, sentiment, was, further, inspired, by, the, rediscovery, of, a, contemporary, 13th, century, wall, painting, of, tamar, in, the, then, ruined, betania, monastery, which, was, uncovered, and, restored, by, prince, grigory, gagarin, in, the, 1840s, the, fresco, became, a, source, of, numerous, engravings, circulating, in, georgia, at, that, time, and, inspired, the, poet, grigol, orbeliani, to, dedicate, a, romantic, poem, to, it, furthermore, the, georgian, literati, reacting, to, russian, rule, in, georgia, and, the, suppression, of, national, institutions, contrasted, tamar, s, era, to, their, contemporary, situation, lamenting, the, irretrievably, lost, past, in, their, writings, hence, tamar, became, a, personification, of, the, heyday, of, georgia, a, perception, that, has, persisted, down, to, the, present, time, during, world, war, ii, three, battalions, of, the, collaborationist, georgian, legion, were, named, after, tamar, tamar, s, marriage, to, the, prince, yuri, of, the, grand, principality, of, vladimir, has, become, a, subject, of, two, resonant, prose, works, in, modern, georgia, shalva, dadiani, s, play, originally, entitled, the, unfortunate, russian, 1916, 1926,

title, and, plot, in, accordance, with, the, official, ideology, of, the, soviet, state, in, 2002, a, satirical, short, story, the, first, russian, penned, by, the, young, georgian, writer, lasha, bughadze, and, focused, on, a, frustrated, wedding, night, of, tamar, and, yuri, outraged, many, conservatives, and, triggered, a, nationwide, controversy, including, heated, discussions, in, the, media, the, parliament, of, georgia, and, the, patriarchate, of, the, georgian, orthodox, church, in, 2018, a, georgian, court, banned, the, sale, of, condoms, from, the, company, aiisa, which,
