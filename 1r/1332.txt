suggestions, made, that, mugabe, may, have, had, some, involvement, in, it, these, rumours, were, never, substantiated, mugabe, remained, aloof, from, the, day, to, day, military, operations, of, zanla, which, he, entrusted, to, tongogara, in, january, 1976, zanla, launched, its, first, major, infiltration, from, mozambique, with, nearly, 1000, guerrillas, crossing, the, border, to, attack,

by, the, latter, part, of, the, decade, the, guerrillas, were, winning, mugabe, focused, on, the, propaganda, war, making, regular, speeches, and, radio, broadcasts, in, these, he, presented, himself, as, a, marxist, leninist, speaking, warmly, of, marxist, leninist, revolutionaries, like, vladimir, lenin, joseph, stalin, and, fidel, castro, despite, his, marxist, views, mugabe, s, meetings, with, soviet, representatives, were, unproductive, for, they, insisted, on, nkomo, s, leadership, of, the, revolutionary, struggle, his, relationship, with, the, people, s, republic, of, china, was, far, warmer, as, the, chinese, maoist, government, supplied, zanla, with, armaments, without, any, conditions, he, also, sought, support, from, western, nations, visiting, western, embassies, in, mozambique, and, travelled, to, both, western, states, like, italy, and, switzerland, and, marxist, governed, states, like, the, soviet, union, china, north, korea, vietnam, and, cuba, mugabe, called, for, the, overthrow, of, rhodesia, s, predominately, white, government, the, execution, of, smith, and, his, criminal, gang, the, expropriation, of, white, owned, land, and, the, transformation, of, rhodesia, into, a, one, party, marxist, state, he, repeatedly, called, for, violence, against, the, country, s, white, minority, referring, to, white, rhodesians, as, blood, sucking, exploiters, sadistic, killers, and, hard, core, racists, in, one, typical, example, taken, from, a, 1978, radio, address, mugabe, declared, let, us, hammer, to, defeat, let, us, blow, up, his, citadel, let, us, give, him, no, time, to, rest, let, us, chase, him, in, every, corner, let, us, rid, our, home, of, this, settler, vermin, for, mugabe, armed, struggle, was, an, essential, part, of, the, establishment, of, a, new, state, in, contrast, to, other, black, nationalist, leaders, like, nkomo, mugabe, opposed, a, negotiated, settlement, with, smith, s, government, in, october, 1976, zanu, nevertheless, established, a, joint, platform, with, zapu, known, as, the, patriotic, front, in, september, 1978, mugabe, met, with, nkomo, in, lusaka, he, was, angry, with, the, latter, s, secret, attempts, to, negotiate, with, smith, the, beginning, of, the, end, for, smith, came, when, south, african, prime, minister, b, j, vorster, concluded, that, white, minority, rule, was, unsustainable, in, a, country, where, blacks, outnumbered, whites, 22, 1, under, pressure, from, vorster, smith, accepted, in, principle, that, white, minority, rule, could, not, be, maintained, forever, he, oversaw, the, 1979, general, election, which, resulted, in, abel, muzorewa, a, politically, moderate, black, bishop, being, elected, prime, minister, of, the, reconstituted, zimbabwe, rhodesia, both,

prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, surprised, delegates, by, announcing, that, the, uk, would, officially, recognize, the, country, s, independence, if, it, transitioned, to, democratic, majority, rule, the, negotiations, took, place, at, lancaster, house, in, london, and, were, led, by, the, conservative, party, politician, peter, carington, mugabe, refused, to, attend, these, london, peace, talks, opposing, the, idea, of, a, negotiated, rather, than, military, solution, to, the, rhodesian, war, machel, insisted, that, he, must, threatening, to, end, mozambican, support, for, the, zanu, pf, if, he, did, not, mugabe, arrived, in, london, in, september, 1979, there, he, and, nkomo, presented, themselves, as, part, of, the, patriotic, front, but, established, separate, headquarters, in, the, city, at, the, conference, the, pair, were, divided, in, their, attitude, nkomo, wanted, to, present, himself, as, a, moderate, while, mugabe, played, up, to, his, image, as, a, marxist, revolutionary, with, carrington, exploiting, this, division, throughout, the, negotiations, mugabe, did, not, trust, the, british, and, believed, that, they, were, manipulating, events, to, their, own, advantage, the, ensuing, lancaster, house, agreement, called, for, all, participants, in, the, rhodesian, bush, war, to, agree, to, a, ceasefire, with, a, british, governor, christopher, soames, arriving, in, rhodesia, to, oversee, an, election, in, which, the, various, factions, could, compete, as, political, parties, it, outlined, a, plan, for, a, transition, to, formal, independence, as, a, sovereign, republic, under, black, majority, rule, also, maintaining, that, rhodesia, would, be, renamed, zimbabwe, a, name, adopted, from, the, iron, age, archaeological, site, of, great, zimbabwe, the, agreement, also, ensured, that, the, country, s, white, minority, retained, many, of, its, economic, and, political, privileges, with, 20, seats, to, be, reserved, for, whites, in, the, new, parliament, by, insisting, on, the, need, for, a, democratic, black, majority, government, carington, was, able, to, convince, mugabe, to, compromise, on, the, other, main, issue, of, the, conference, that, of, land, ownership, mugabe, agreed, to, the, protection, of, the, white, community, s, privately, owned, property, on, the, condition, that, the, uk, and, u, s, governments, provide, financial, assistance, allowing, the, zimbabwean, government, to, purchase, much, land, for, redistribution, among, blacks, mugabe, was, opposed, to, the, idea, of, a, ceasefire, but, under, pressure, from, machel, he, agreed, to, it, mugabe, signed, the, agreement, but, felt, cheated, remaining, disappointed, that, he, had, never, achieved, a, military, victory, over, the, rhodesian, forces, returning, to, salisbury, in, january, 1980, mugabe, was, greeted, by, a, supportive, crowd, he, settled, into, a, house, in, mount, pleasant, a, wealthy, white, dominated, suburb, machel, had, cautioned, mugabe, not, to, alienate, rhodesia, s, white, minority, warning, him, that, any, white, flight, after, the, election, would, cause, economic, damage, as, it, had, in, mozambique, accordingly, during, his, electoral, campaign, mugabe, avoided, the, use, of, marxist, and, revolutionary, rhetoric, mugabe, insisted, that, in, the, election, zanu, would, stand, as, a, separate, party, to, zapu, and, refused, nkomo, s, request, for, a, meeting, he, formed, zanu, into, a, political, party, known, as, zimbabwe, african, national, union, patriotic, front, zanu, pf, predictions, were, made, that, zanu, pf, would, win, the, election, on, the, basis, of, the, country, s, ethnic, divisions, mugabe, was, shona, a, community, that, made, up, around, 70, of, the, country, s, population, while, nkomo, was, ndebele, a, tribal, group, who, made, up, only, around, 20, for, many, in, the, white, community, and, in, the, british, government, this, outcome, was, a, terrifying, prospect, due, to, mugabe, s, avowed, marxist, beliefs, and, the, inflammatory, comments, that, he, had, made, about, whites, during, the, guerrilla, war, during, the, campaign, mugabe, survived, two, assassination, attempts, in, the, first, which, took, place, on, 6, february, a, grenade, was, thrown, at, his, mount, pleasant, home, where, it, exploded, against, a, garden, wall, in, the, second, on, 10, february, a, roadside, bomb, exploded, near, his, motorcade, as, he, left, a, fort, victoria, rally, mugabe, himself, was, unharmed, mugabe, accused, the, rhodesian, security, forces, of, being, responsible, for, these, attacks, in, an, attempt, to, quell, the, possibility, that, rhodesia, s, security, forces, would, launch, a, coup, to, prevent, the, election, mugabe, met, with, peter, walls, the, commander, of, rhodesia, s, armed, forces, and, asked, him, to, remain, in, his, position, in, the, event, of, a, zanu, pf, victory, at, the, time, walls, refused, the, electoral,

intimidation, mugabe, was, called, before, soames, at, government, house, mugabe, regarded, the, meeting, as, a, british, attempt, to, thwart, his, electoral, campaign, under, the, terms, of, the, negotiation, soames, had, the, power, to, disqualify, any, political, party, guilty, of, voter, intimidation, rhodesia, s, security, services, nkomo, muzorewa, and, some, of, his, own, advisers, all, called, on, soames, to, disqualify, zanu, pf, after, deliberation, soames, disagreed, believing, that, zanu, pf, were, sure, to, win, the, election, and, that, disqualifying, them, would, wreck, any, chance, of, an, orderly, transition, of, power, in, the, february, election, zanu, pf, secured, 63, of, the, national, vote, gaining, 57, of, the, 80, parliamentary, seats, allocated, for, black,

soames, as, a, good, friend, mugabe, unsuccessfully, urged, soames, to, remain, in, zimbabwe, for, several, more, years, and, also, failed, to, convince, the, uk, to, assume, a, two, year, guiding, role, for, his, government, because, most, zanu, pf, members, lacked, experience, in, governing, zanu, pf, s, absolute, parliamentary, majority, allowed, them, to, rule, alone, but, mugabe, created, a, government, of, national, unity, by, inviting, members, of, rival, parties, to, join, his, cabinet, mugabe, moved, into, the, premier, s, residence, in, salisbury, which, he, left, furnished, in,

forces, mugabe, s, government, continued, to, make, regular, pronouncements, about, converting, zimbabwe, into, a, socialist, society, in, contrast, to, mugabe, s, talk, of, socialism, his, government, s, budgetary, policies, were, conservative, operating, within, a, capitalist, framework, and, emphasizing, the, need, for, foreign, investment, in, office, mugabe, sought, a, gradual, transformation, away, from, capitalism, and, tried, to, build, upon, existing, state, institutions, from, 1980, to, 1990, the, country, s, economy, grew, by, an, average, of, 2, 7, a, year, but, this,

and, expensive, cars, sending, their, children, to, private, schools, and, obtaining, farms, and, businesses, to, contain, their, excesses, in, 1984, mugabe, drew, up, a, leadership, code, which, prohibited, any, senior, figures, from, obtaining, more, than, one, salary, or, owning, over, 50, acres, of, agricultural, land, there, were, exceptions, with, mugabe, giving, permission, to, general,

the, only, permitted, exceptions, were, if, the, land, was, underutilized, or, needed, for, a, public, purpose, in, which, case, the, government, could, compulsorily, purchase, it, while, fully,

forgotten, if, ever, we, look, to, the, past, let, us, do, so, for, the, lesson, the, past, has, taught, us, namely, that, oppression, and, racism, are, inequalities, that, must, never, find, scope, in, our, political, and, social, system, it, could, never, be, a, correct, justification, that, just, because, the, whites, oppressed, us, yesterday, when, they, had, power, the, blacks, must, oppress, them, today, because, they, have, power, an, evil, remains, an, evil, whether, practised, by, white, against, black, or, black, against, white, mugabe, s, speech, after, his, 1980, victory, mugabe, initially, emphasized, racial, reconciliation, and, he, was, keen, to, build, a, good, relationship, with, white, zimbabweans, he, hoped, to, avoid, a, white, exodus, and, tried, to, allay, fears, that, he, would, nationalize, white, owned, property, he, appointed, two, white, ministers, david, smith, and, denis, norman, to, his, government, met, with, white, leaders, in, agriculture,

were, the, victims, of, racial, discrimination, many, whites, remained, uneasy, about, living, under, the, government, of, a, black, marxist, and, they, also, feared, that, their, children, would, be, unable, to, secure, jobs, there, was, a, growing, exodus, to, south, africa, and, in, 1980, 17, 000, whites, approximately, a, tenth, of, the, white, zimbabwean, population, emigrated, mugabe, s, government, had, pledged, support, for, the, african, national, congress, and, other, anti, apartheid, forces, within, south, africa, but, did, not, allow, them, to, use, zimbabwe, as, a, base, for, their, military, operations, to, protest, apartheid, and, white, minority, rule, in, south, africa, mugabe, s, government, banned, zimbabwe, from, engaging, south, africa, in, any, sporting,

counter, revolutionary, elements, in, the, white, community, stating, that, despite, the, fact, that, they, had, faced, no, punishment, for, their, past, actions, they, rejected, racial, reconciliation, and, are, acting, in, collusion, with, south, africa, to, harm, our, racial, relations, to, destroy, our, unity, to, sabotage, our, economy, and, to, overthrow, the, popularly, elected, government, i, lead, increasingly, he, criticised, not, only, the, militants, but, the, entire, white, community, for, holding, a, monopoly, on, zimbabwe, s, economic, power, this, was, a, view, echoed, by, many, government, ministers, and, the, government, controlled, media, one, of, these, ministers, tekere, was, involved, in, an, incident, in, which, he, and, seven, armed, men, stormed, a, white, owned, farmhouse, killing, an, elderly, farmer, they, alleged, that, in, doing, so, they, were, foiling, a, coup, attempt, tekere, was, acquitted, of, murder, however, mugabe, dropped, him, from, his, cabinet, racial, mistrust, and, suspicion, continued, to, grow, in, december, 1981, the, elderly, white, mp, wally, stuttaford, was, accused, of, being, a, south, african,

officers, were, accused, of, complicity, arrested, and, tortured, they, were, put, on, trial, but, cleared, by, judges, after, which, they, were, immediately, re, arrested, their, case, generated, an, international, outcry, which, mugabe, criticized, stating, that, the, case, only, gained, such, attention, because, the, accused, were, white, his, defence, of, torture, and, contempt, for, legal, procedures, damaged, his, international, standing, white, flight, continued, to, grow, and, within, three, years, of, mugabe, s, premiership, half, of, all, white, zimbabweans, had, emigrated, in, the, 1985, election, smith, s, conservative, alliance, of, zimbabwe, won, 15, of, the, 20, seats, allocated, for, white, zimbabweans, mugabe, was, outraged, by, this, result, lambasting, white, zimbabweans, for, not, repenting, in, any, way, by, continuing, to, support, smith, and, other, white, politicians, who, had, committed, horrors, against, the, people, of, zimbabwe, under, the, new,

zimbabwe, be, converted, into, a, one, party, state, tekere, and, enos, nkala, were, particularly, adamant, that, there, should, be, a, crackdown, on, zapu, after, nkala, called, for, zapu, to, be, violently, crushed, during, a, rally, in, entumbane, street, clashes, between, the, two, parties, broke, out, in, the, city, in, january, 1981, mugabe, demoted, nkomo, in, a, cabinet, reshuffle, the,

dissenters, although, nkomo, denounced, the, dissidents, and, their, south, african, supporters, mugabe, authorized, the, police, and, army, to, crack, down, on, the, matabeleland, dissenters, declaring, that, state, officers, would, be, granted, legal, immunity, for, any, extra, legal, actions, they, may, perform, while, doing, so, during, 1982, he, had, established, the, fifth, brigade,

zimbabwe, congress, of, trade, unions, by, 1990, 52, 000, black, families, had, been, settled, on, 6, 5, million, acres, this, was, insufficient, to, deal, with, the, country, s, overcrowding, problem, which, was, being, exacerbated, by, the, growth, in, the, black, population, that, year, zimbabwe, s, parliament, passed, an, amendment, allowing, the, government, to, expropriate, land, at, a, fixed, price, while, denying, land, owners, the, right, of, appeal, to, the, courts, the, government, hoped, that, by, doing, so, it, could, settle, 110, 000, black, families, on, 13, million, acres, which, would, require, the, expropriation, of, approximately, half, of, all, white, owned, land, zimbabwe, s, commercial, farmers, union, argued, that, the, proposed, measures, would, wreck, the, country, s, economy, urging, the, government, to, instead, settle, landless, blacks, on, the, half, a, million, acres, of, land, that, was, either, unproductive, or, state, owned, concerns, about, the, proposed, measure, particularly, its, denial, of, the, right, to, appeal, were, voiced, by, the, uk, us, and, catholic, commission, for, justice, and, peace, the, us, uk, international,

in, april, 1994, a, newspaper, investigation, found, that, not, all, of, this, was, redistributed, to, landless, blacks, much, of, the, expropriated, land, was, being, leased, to, ministers, and, senior, officials, such, as, witness, mangwede, who, was, leased, a, 3000, acre, farm, in, hwedza, responding, to, this, scandal, in, 1994, the, uk, government, which, had, supplied, 44, million, for,

was, controversial, among, the, catholic, community, because, of, the, adulterous, nature, of, mugabe, and, marufu, s, relationship, to, house, his, family, mugabe, then, built, a, new, mansion, at, borrowdale, in, the, 1995, parliamentary, election, which, saw, a, low, turnout, of, 31, 7, zanu, pf, gained, 147, out, of, 150, seats, following, the, election, mugabe, expanded, his, cabinet, from, 29, to, 42, ministers, while, the, government, adopted, a, 133, pay, rise, for, mps, by, the, mid, 1990s, mugabe, had, become, an, irascible, and, petulant, dictator, brooking, no, opposition, contemptuous, of, the, law, and, human, rights, surrounded, by, sycophantic, ministers, and, indifferent, to, the, incompetence, and, corruption, around, him, his, record, of, economic, management, was, lamentable, he, had, failed, to, satisfy, popular, expectations, in, education, health, land, reform, and, employment, and, he, had, alienated, the, entire, white, community, yet, all, the, while, mugabe, continued, to, believe, in, his, own, greatness, isolated, and, remote, from, ordinary, reality, possessing, no, close, friends, and, showing, clear, signs, of, paranoia, he, listened, only, to, an, inner, circle, of, conspiratorial, aides, and, colleagues, whatever, difficulties, occurred, he, attributed, to, old, enemies, britain, the, west, the, old, rhodesian, network, all, bent, he, believed, on, destroying, his, revolution, mugabe, biographer, martin, meredith, over, the, course, of, the, 1990s, zimbabwe, s, economy, steadily, deteriorated, by, 2000, living, standards,

the, guerrilla, armies, in, the, revolutionary, war, and, in, august, 1997, mugabe, put, together, a, pension, package, that, would, cost, the, county, z, 4, 2, billion, to, finance, this, pension, scheme, mugabe, s, government, proposed, new, taxes, but, a, general, strike, was, called, in, protest, in, december, 1997, amid, protest, from, zanu, pf, itself, mugabe, s, government, abandoned,

and, manufacturing, industry, he, called, on, supporters, to, strike, fear, in, the, hearts, of, the, white, man, our, real, enemy, and, accused, his, black, opponents, of, being, dupes, of, the, whites, amid, growing, internal, opposition, to, his, government, he, remained, determined, to, stay, in, power, he, revived, the, regular, use, of, revolutionary, rhetoric, and, sought, to, re, assert, his, credentials, as, an, important, revolutionary, leader, mugabe, also, developed, a, growing, preoccupation, with, homosexuality, lambasting, it, as, an, un, african, import, from, europe, he, described, gay, people, as, being, guilty, of, sub, human, behavior, and, of, being, worse, than, dogs, and, pigs, this, attitude, may, have, stemmed, in, part, from, his, strong, conservative, values, but, it, was, strengthened, by, the, fact, that, several, ministers, in, the, british, government, were, gay, mugabe, began, to, believe, that, there, was, a, gay, mafia, and, that, all, of, his, critics, were, homosexuals, critics, also, accused, mugabe, of, using, homophobia, to, distract, attention, from, the, country, s, problems, in, august, 1995, he, was, due, to, open, a, human,

the, recent, referendum, mugabe, justified, the, seizures, by, the, fact, that, this, land, had, been, seized, by, white, settlers, from, the, indigenous, african, population, in, the, 1890s, he,

him, to, be, buried, in, zvimba, on, either, 16, or, 17, september, a, day, later, than, the, government, s, proposal, on, 14, september, 2019, mugabe, s, state, funeral, which, was, also, open, to,

2019, mugabeism, as, a, form, of, populist, reason, is, a, multifaceted, phenomenon, requiring, a, multi, pronged, approach, to, decipher, its, various, meanings, at, one, level, it, represents, pan, african, memory, and, patriotism, and, at, another, level, it, manifests, itself, as, a, form, of, radical, left, nationalism, dedicated, to, resolving, intractable, national, and, agrarian, questions, yet, to, others, it, is, nothing, but, a, symbol, of, crisis, chaos, and, tyranny, emanating, from, the, exhaustion, of, nationalism, sabelo, j, ndlovu, gatsheni, mugabe, embraced, african, nationalism, and, anti, colonialism, during, the, 1960s, sabelo, j, ndlovu, gatsheni, characterised, mugabeism, as, a, populist, movement, that, was, marked, by, ideological, simplicity, emptiness, vagueness, imprecision, and, multi, class, character, further, noting, that, it, was, a, broad, church, he, also, characterised, it, as, a, form, of, left, nationalism, which, consistently, railed, against, imperialism, and, colonialism, he, also, argued, that, it, was, a, form, of, nativism, which, was, permeated, by, a, strong, cult, of, victimisation, in, which, a, binary, view, was, propagated, where, africa, was, a, victim, and, the, west, was, its, tormentor, he, suggested, that, it, had, been, influenced, by, a, wide, range, of, ideologies, among, them, forms, of, marxism, like, stalinism, and, maoism, as, well, as, african, nationalist, ideologies, like, nkrumaism, ujamaa, garveyism, n, gritude, pan, africanism, and, african, neo, traditionalism, mugabeism, sought, to, deal, with, the, problem, of, white, settler, racism, by, engaging, in, a, project, of, anti, white, racism, that, sought, to, deny, white, zimbabweans, citizenship, by, constantly, referring, to, them, as, amabhunu, boers, thus, enabling, their, removal, from, their, land, zanu, pf, claimed, that, it, was, influenced, by, marxism, leninism, onslow, and, redding, stated, that, in, contrast, to, the, marxist, emphasis, on, the, urban, proletariat, as, the, main, force, of, socio, economic, change, mugabe, s, party, accorded, that, role, to, the, rural, peasantry, as, a, result, of, this, pro, rural, view, they, argued, mugabe, and, the, zanu, pf, demonstrated, an, anti, urban, bias, the, english, academic, claire, palley, met, mugabe, in, 1962, later, noting, that, he, struck, me, as, not, so, much, a, doctrinaire, marxist, but, an, old, fashioned, african, nationalist, while, tekere, claimed, that, for, mugabe, marxism, leninism, was, just, rhetoric, with, no, genuine, vision, or, belief, behind, it, carington, noted, that, while, mugabe, used, marxist, rhetoric, during, the, lancaster, house, negotiations, of, course, he, didn, t, actually, practise, what, he, preached, did, he, once, in, office, he, became, a, capitalist, mugabe, has, stated, that, socialism, has, to, be, much, more, christian, than, capitalism, the, zimbabwean, scholar, george, shire, described, mugabe, s, policies, as, being, broadly, speaking, social, democratic, during, the, 1980s, mugabe, indicated, his, desire, to, transform, zimbabwe, from, a, multi, party, state, into, a, one, party, state, in, 1984, he, stated, that, the, one, party, state, is, more, in, keeping, with, african, tradition, it, makes, for, greater, unity, for, the, people, it, puts, all, opinions, under, one, umbrella, whether, these, opinions, are, radical, or, reactionary, the, political, scientist, sue, onslow, and, historian, sean, redding, stated, that, zimbabwe, s, situation, was, more, complex, than, pure, venial, dictatorship, but, that, it, was, an, ideo, dictatorship, mugabe, openly, admired, nicolae, ceau, escu, of, romania, praising, him, just, before, he, was, overthrown, in, december, 1989, ndlovu, gatsheni, argued, that, since, the, mid, 1990s, mugabe, s, rhetoric, and, speeches, came, to, be, dominated, by, three, main, themes, an, obsession, with, a, perceived, british, threat, to, re, colonise, zimbabwe, to, transfer, the, land, controlled, by, white, farmers, to, the, black, population, and, issues, of, belonging, and, patriotism, references, to, the, rhodesian, bush, war, featured, prominently, in, his, speeches, the, scholar, of, african, studies, abiodun, alao, noted, that, mugabe, was, determined, to, take, advantage, of, the, past, in, order, to, secure, a, firm, grip, on, national, security, david, blair, stated, that, mugabe, s, collected, writings, amount, to, nothing, more, than, crude, marxism, couched, in, the, ponderous, english, of, the, mission, school, remarking, that, they, were, heavily, informed, by, karl, marx, mao, zedong, and, frantz, fanon, and, displayed, little, originality, blair, noted, that, mugabe, s, writings, called, for, command, economics, in, a, peasant, society, mixed, with, anti, colonial, nationalism, and, that, in, this, he, held, the, same, opinions, as, almost, every, other, african, guerrilla, leader, of, that, period, mugabe, argued, that, following, the, overthrow, of, european, colonial, regimes, western, countries, continued, to, keep, african, countries, in, a, state, of, subservience, because, they, desired, the, continent, s, natural, resources, while, preventing, it, from, industrializing, mugabe, measured, a, little, over, 1, 70, metres, 5, ft, 7, in, and, exhibited, what, his, biographer, david, blair, described, as, curious, effeminate, mannerisms, mugabe, took, great, care, with, his, appearance, typically, wearing, a, three, piece, suit, and, insisted, that, members, of, his, cabinet, dressed, in, a, similar, anglophile, fashion, on, taking, power, in, 1980, mugabe, s, hallmark, was, his, wide, rimmed, glasses, and, he, was, also, known, for, his, tiny, moustache, unlike, a, number, of, other, african, leaders, mugabe, did, not, seek, to, mythologise, his, childhood, he, avoided, smoking, and, drinking, and, according, to, his, first, biographers, david, smith, and, colin, simpson, had, enormous, affection, for, children, during, his, early, life, he, had, an, operation, on, his, genitals, which, generated, rumours, that, he, had, only, one, testicle, or, half, a, penis, such, rumours, were, used, by, opponents, to, ridicule, him, and, by, supporters, to, bolster, the, claim, that, he, was, willing, to, make, severe, sacrifices, for, the, revolutionary, cause, mugabe, spoke, english, fluently, with, an, adopted, english, accent, when, pronouncing, certain, words, he, was, also, a, fan, of, the, english, game, of, cricket, stating, that, cricket, civilizes, people, and, creates, good, gentlemen, david, blair, noted, that, this, cultivation, of, british, traits, suggested, that, mugabe, respected, and, perhaps, admired, britain, while, at, the, same, time, resenting, and, loathing, the, country, heidi, holland, suggested, that, these, anglophile, traits, arose, in, early, life, as, mugabe, who, had, long, experienced, the, anti, black, racism, of, rhodesian, society, grasped, englishness, as, an, antidote, to, the, self, loathing, induced, by, societal, racism, the, academic, blessing, miles, tendi, stated, that, mugabe, was, an, extremely, complex, figure, not, easily, captured, by, conventional, categories, similarly, david, blair, described, him, as, an, exceptionally, complex, personality, smith, and, simpson, noted, that, the, zimbabwean, leader, had, been, a, serious, young, man, something, of, a, loner, diligent, hard, working, a, voracious, reader, who, used, every, minute, of, his, time, not, much, given, to, laughter, but, above, all, single, minded, blair, commented, that, mugabe, s, self, discipline, intelligence, and, appetite, for, hard, work, were, remarkable, adding, that, his, prime, characteristics, were, ruthlessness, and, resilience, blair, argued, that, mugabe, shared, many, character, traits, with, ian, smith, stating, that, they, were, both, proud, brave, stubborn, charismatic, deluded, fantasists, with, his, poor, childhood, development, record, even, minor, criticism, would, be, experienced, as, a, wound, by, mugabe, he, is, a, person, who, cannot, tolerate, difference, being, profoundly, doubtful, about, himself, he, is, oversensitive, to, the, idea, that, he, is, not, as, good, as, everyone, else, people, are, either, with, him, or, against, him, differences, of, opinion, are, provocative, and, hurtful, to, mugabe, who, may, think, that, compromise, reduces, him, heidi, holland, meredith, described, mugabe, as, having, a, soft, spoken,

power, stemmed, from, ideological, and, personal, reasons, and, his, belief, in, the, illegitimacy, of, his, political, opposition, denis, norman, a, white, politician, who, served, in, mugabe, s, cabinet, for, many, years, commented, that, mugabe, isn, t, a, flashy, man, driven, by, wealth, but, he, does, enjoy, power, that, s, always, been, his, motivation, according, to, holland, mugabe, s,

which, drew, accusations, from, opposition, politician, tendai, biti, that, they, were, wasting, zimbabwean, taxpayers, money, the, story, of, robert, mugabe, is, a, microcosm, of, what, bedevils, african, democracy, and, economic, recovery, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, it, is, a, classic, case, of, a, genuine, hero, the, guerrilla, idol, who, conquered, the, country, s, former, leader, and, his, white, supremacist, regime, turning, into, a, peevish, autocrat, whose, standard, response, to, those, suggesting, he, steps, down, is, to, tell, them, to, get, lost, it, is, also, the, story, of, activists, who, try, to, make, a, better, society, but, bear, the, indelible, scars, of, the, old, system, mugabe, s, political, education, came, from, the, autocrat, ian, smith, who, had, learnt, his, formative, lessons, from, imperious, british, colonisers, heidi, holland, by, the, twenty, first, century, mugabe, was, regarded, as, one, of, the, world, s, most, controversial, political, leaders, according, to, the, black, scholar, journal, depending, on, who, you, listen, to, mugabe, is, either, one, of, the, world, s, great, tyrants, or, a, fearless, nationalist, who, has, incurred, the, wrath, of, the, west, he, has, been, widely, described, as, a, dictator, a, tyrant, and, a, threat, and, has, been, referred, to, as, one, of, africa, s, most, brutal, leaders, at, the, same, time, he, continued, to, be, regarded, as, a, hero, in, many, third, world, countries, and, received, a, warm, reception, when, travelling, throughout, africa, for, many, in, southern, africa, he, remained, one, of, the, grand, old, men, of, the, african, liberation, movement, mugabe, was, known, to, have, close, ties, with, former, malaysian, prime, minister, mahathir, mohamad, according, to, ndlovu, gatsheni, within, zanu, pf, mugabe, was, regarded, as, a, demi, god, who, was, feared, and, rarely, challenged, within, the, zanu, movement, a, cult, of, personality, began, to, be, developed, around, mugabe, during, the, bush, war, and, was, consolidated, after, 1980, mugabe, had, a, considerable, following, within, zimbabwe, with, david, blair, noting, that, it, would, be, wrong, to, imply, that, he, lacked, genuine, popularity, in, the, country, holland, believed, that, the, great, majority, of, zimbabwe, s, population, supported, him, enthusiastically, during, the, first, twenty, years, of, his, regime, his, strongholds, of, support, were, zimbabwe, s, shona, dominated, regions, of, mashonaland, manicaland, and, masvingo, while, he, remained, far, less, popular, in, the, non, shona, areas, of, matabeleland, and, bulawayo, and, among, the, zimbabwean, diaspora, living, abroad, at, the, time, of, his, 1980, election, victory, mugabe, was, internationally, acclaimed, as, a, revolutionary, hero, who, was, embracing, racial, reconciliation, and, for, the, first, decade, of, his, governance, he, was, widely, regarded, as, one, of, post, colonial, africa, s, most, progressive, leaders, david, blair, argued, that, while, mugabe, did, exhibit, a, conciliatory, phase, between, march, 1980, and, february, 1982, his, rule, was, otherwise, dominated, by, a, ruthless, quest, to, crush, his, opponents, and, remain, in, office, at, whatever, cost, in, 2011, the, scholar, blessing, miles, tendi, stated, that, mugabe, is, often, presented, in, the, international, media, as, the, epitome, of, the, popular, leader, gone, awry, the, independence, struggle, hero, who, seemed, initially, a, progressive, egalitarian, but, has, gradually, been, corrupted, through, his, attachment, to, power, during, a, long, and, increasingly, repressive, spell, in, office, tendi, argued, that, this, was, a, misleading, assessment, because, mugabe, had, displayed, repressive, tendencies, from, his, early, years, in, office, namely, through, the, repression, of, zapu, in, matabeleland, abiodun, alao, concurred, suggesting, that, mugabe, s, approach, had, not, changed, over, the, course, of, his, leadership, but, merely, that, international, attention, had, intensified, in, the, twenty, first, century, for, many, africans, mugabe, exposed, the, double, standards, of, western, countries, the, latter, had, turned, a, blind, eye, to, the, massacre, of, over, 20, 000, black, ndebele, civilians, in, the, gukarakundi, but, strongly, censured, the, zimbabwean, government, when, a, small, number, of, white, farmers, were, killed, during, the, land, seizures, during, the, guerrilla, war, ian, smith, referred, to, mugabe, as, the, apostle, of, satan, george, shire, expressed, the, view, that, there, was, a, strong, racist, animus, against, mugabe, within, zimbabwe, and, that, this, had, typically, been, overlooked, by, western, media, representations, of, the, country, mugabe, himself, was, accused, of, racism, john, sentamu, the, uganda, born, archbishop, of, york, in, the, united, kingdom, called, mugabe, the, worst, kind, of, racist, dictator, for, having, targeted, the, whites, for, their, apparent, riches, desmond, tutu, stated, that, mugabe, became, increasingly, insecure, he, s, hitting, out, one, just, wants, to, weep, it, s, very, sad, south, african, president, nelson, mandela, was, also, critical, of, mugabe, referring, to, him, as, a, politician, who, despise, the, very, people, who, put, in, power, and, think, it, s, a, privilege, to, be, there, for, eternity, writing, for, the, human, rights, quarterly, rhoda, e, howard, hassmann, claimed, that, there, was, clear, evidence, that, mugabe, was, guilty, of, crimes, against, humanity, in, 2009, gregory, stanton, then, president, of, the, international, association, of, genocide, scholars, and, helen, fein, then, executive, director, of, the, institute, for, the, study, of, genocide, published, a, letter, in, the, new, york, times, stating, that, there, was, sufficient, evidence, of, crimes, against, humanity, to, bring, mugabe, to, trial, in, front, of, the, international, criminal, court, australia, and, new, zealand, had, previously, called, for, this, in, 2005, and, a, number, of, zimbabwean, ngos, did, so, in, 2006, a, 2005, article, from, the, new, american, titled, democide, in, zimbabwe, says, that, mugabe, reduced, the, population, of, zimbabwe, by, millions, in, just, a, few, years, in, 1994, mugabe, received, an, honorary, knighthood, from, the, british, state, this, was, stripped, from, him, at, the, advice, of, the, uk, government, in, 2008, mugabe, held, several, honorary, degrees, and, doctorates, from, international, universities, awarded, to, him, in, the, 1980s, at, least, three, of, these, have, since, been, revoked, in, june, 2007, he, became, the, first, international, figure, ever, to, be, stripped, of, an, honorary, degree, by, a, british, university, when, the, university, of, edinburgh, withdrew, the, degree, awarded, to, him, in, 1984, on, 12, june, 2008, the, university, of, massachusetts, amherst, board, of, trustees, voted, to, revoke, the, law, degree, awarded, to, mugabe, in, 1986, the, first, time, one, of, its, honorary, degrees, has, been, revoked, in, the, month, after, being, deposed, but, before, he, died, many, of, the, public, references, to, mugabe, street, names, for, example, had, been, removed, from, public, places
