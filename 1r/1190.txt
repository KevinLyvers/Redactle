pope, gregory, vii, latin, gregorius, vii, c, 1015, 25, may, 1085, born, hildebrand, of, sovana, italian, ildebrando, di, soana, was, head, of, the, catholic, church, and, ruler, of, the, papal, states, from, 22, april, 1073, to, his, death, in, 1085, he, is, venerated, as, a, saint, in, the, catholic, church, one, of, the, great, reforming, popes, he, is, perhaps, best, known, for, the, part, he, played, in, the, investiture, controversy, his, dispute, with, emperor, henry, iv, to, establish, the, primacy, of, papal, authority, and, the, new, canon, law, governing, the, election, of, the, pope, by, the, college, of, cardinals, he, was, also, at, the, forefront, of, developments, in, the, relationship, between, the, emperor, and, the, papacy, during, the, years, before, he, became, pope, he, was, the, first, pope, to, introduce, a, policy, of, obligatory, celibacy, for, the, clergy, which, had, until, then, commonly, married, and, also, attacked, the, practice, of, simony, during, the, power, struggles, between, the, papacy, and, the, empire, gregory, excommunicated, henry, iv, three, times, and, henry, appointed, antipope, clement, iii, to, oppose, him, though, gregory, was, hailed, as, one, of, the, greatest, of, the, roman, pontiffs, after, his, reforms, proved, successful, during, his, own, reign, he, was, denounced, by, some, for, his, autocratic, use, of, papal, powers, in, later, times, gregory, vii, became, an, exemplar, of, papal, supremacy, and, his, memory, was, invoked, both, positively, and, negatively, reflecting, later, writers, attitude, to, the, catholic, church, and, the, papacy, beno, of, santi, martino, e, silvestro, who, opposed, gregory, vii, in, the, investiture, controversy, accused, him, of, necromancy, cruelty, tyranny, and, blasphemy, this, was, eagerly, repeated, by, later, opponents, of, the, catholic, church, such, as, the, english, protestant, john, foxe, in, contrast, the, modern, historian, and, anglican, priest, h, e, j, cowdrey, writes, was, surprisingly, flexible, feeling, his, way, and, therefore, perplexing, both, rigorous, collaborators, and, cautious, and, steady, minded, ones, his, zeal, moral, force, and, religious, conviction, however, ensured, that, he, should, retain, to, a, remarkable, degree, the, loyalty, and, service, of, a, wide, variety, of, men, and, women, gregory, was, born, hildebrand, italian, ildebrando, in, the, town, of, sovana, in, the, county, of, grosseto, now, southern, tuscany, the, son, of, a, blacksmith, as, a, youth, he, was, sent, to, study, in, rome, at, the, monastery, of, st, mary, on, the, aventine, where, his, uncle, was, reportedly, abbot, of, a, monastery, on, the, aventine, hill, among, his, masters, were, the, erudite, lawrence, archbishop, of, amalfi, and, johannes, gratianus, the, future, pope, gregory, vi, when, the, latter, was, deposed, at, the, council, of, sutri, in, december, of, 1046, with, approval, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, henry, iii, and, exiled, to, germany, hildebrand, followed, him, to, cologne, according, to, some, chroniclers, hildebrand, moved, to, cluny, after, gregory, vi, s, death, which, occurred, in, 1048, though, his, declaration, to, have, become, a, monk, at, cluny, is, disputed, he, then, accompanied, cluny, s, abbot, bruno, of, toul, to, rome, there, bruno, was, elected, pope, choosing, the, name, leo, ix, and, named, hildebrand, as, deacon, and, papal, administrator, in, 1054, leo, sent, hildebrand, as, his, legate, to, tours, in, france, in, the, wake, of, the, controversy, created, by, berengar, of, tours, at, leo, s, death, the, new, pope, victor, ii, confirmed, him, as, legate, while, victor, s, successor, stephen, ix, sent, him, and, anselm, of, lucca, to, germany, to, obtain, recognition, from, empress, agnes, stephen, died, before, being, able, to, return, to, rome, but, hildebrand, was, successful, he, was, then, instrumental, in, overcoming, the, crisis, caused, by, the, roman, aristocracy, s, election, of, an, antipope, benedict, x, who, thanks, also, to, agnes, s, support, was, replaced, by, the, bishop, of, florence, nicholas, ii, with, the, help, of, 300, norman, knights, sent, by, richard, of, aversa, hildebrand, personally, led, the, conquest, of, the, castle, of, galeria, antica, where, benedict, had, taken, refuge, between, 1058, and, 1059, he, was, made, archdeacon, of, the, roman, church, becoming, the, most, important, figure, in, the, papal, administration, he, was, again, the, most, powerful, figure, behind, the, election, of, anselm, of, lucca, the, elder, as, pope, alexander, ii, in, the, papal, election, of, october, 1061, the, new, pope, put, forward, the, reform, program, devised, by, hildebrand, and, his, followers, in, his, years, as, papal, advisor, hildebrand, had, an, important, role, in, the, reconciliation, with, the, norman, kingdom, of, southern, italy, in, the, anti, german, alliance, with, the, pataria, movement, in, northern, italy, and, above, all, in, the, introduction, of, an, ecclesiastic, law, which, gave, the, cardinals, exclusive, rights, concerning, the, election, of, a, new, pope, pope, gregory, vii, was, one, of, the, few, popes, elected, by, acclamation, on, the, death, of, alexander, ii, on, 21, april, 1073, as, the, obsequies, were, being, performed, in, the, lateran, basilica, there, arose, a, loud, outcry, from, the, clergy, and, people, let, hildebrand, be, pope, blessed, peter, has, chosen, hildebrand, the, archdeacon, hildebrand, immediately, fled, and, hid, himself, for, some, time, thereby, making, it, clear, that, he, had, refused, the, uncanonical, election, in, the, liberian, basilica, he, was, finally, found, at, the, church, of, san, pietro, in, vincoli, to, which, a, famous, monastery, was, attached, and, elected, pope, by, the, assembled, cardinals, with, the, due, consent, of, the, roman, clergy, amid, the, repeated, acclamations, of, the, people, it, was, debated, at, the, time, and, since, whether, this, extraordinary, outburst, in, favour, of, hildebrand, by, clergy, and, people, was, wholly, spontaneous, or, could, have, been, pre, arranged, according, to, benizo, bishop, of, sutri, a, supporter, of, hildebrand, the, outcry, was, begun, by, cardinal, ugo, candidus, cardinal, priest, of, s, clemente, who, rushed, into, a, pulpit, and, began, to, declaim, to, the, people, certainly, the, mode, of, his, election, was, highly, criticized, by, his, opponents, many, of, the, accusations, against, him, may, have, been, expressions, of, personal, dislike, liable, to, suspicion, from, the, very, fact, that, they, were, not, raised, to, attack, his, promotion, until, several, years, later, but, it, is, clear, from, gregory, s, own, account, of, the, circumstances, of, his, election, in, his, epistle, 1, and, epistle, 2, that, it, was, conducted, in, a, very, irregular, fashion, contrary, to, the, constitution, of, the, pope, of, 607, this, ecclesiastical, statute, forbade, a, papal, election, to, begin, until, the, third, day, after, a, pope, s, burial, cardinal, ugo, s, intervention, was, contrary, to, the, constitution, of, nicholas, ii, which, affirmed, the, exclusive, right, to, name, candidates, to, cardinal, bishops, finally, it, ignored, the, constitution, s, requirement, that, the, holy, roman, emperor, be, consulted, however, gregory, was, then, confirmed, by, a, second, election, at, s, pietro, in, vincoli, gregory, vii, s, earliest, pontifical, letters, clearly, acknowledged, these, events, and, thus, helped, defuse, doubts, about, his, election, and, popularity, on, 22, may, 1073, the, feast, of, pentecost, he, received, ordination, as, a, priest, and, he, was, consecrated, a, bishop, and, enthroned, as, pope, on, 29, june, the, feast, of, st, peter, s, chair, in, the, decree, of, election, his, electors, proclaimed, gregory, vii, a, devout, man, a, man, mighty, in, human, and, divine, knowledge, a, distinguished, lover, of, equity, and, justice, a, man, firm, in, adversity, and, temperate, in, prosperity, a, man, according, to, the, saying, of, the, apostle, of, good, behavior, blameless, modest, sober, chaste, given, to, hospitality, and, one, that, ruleth, well, his, own, house, a, man, from, his, childhood, generously, brought, up, in, the, bosom, of, this, mother, church, and, for, the, merit, of, his, life, already, raised, to, the, archidiaconal, dignity, we, choose, then, our, archdeacon, hildebrand, to, be, pope, and, successor, to, the, apostle, and, to, bear, henceforward, and, forever, the, name, of, gregory, 22, april, 1073, gregory, vii, s, first, attempts, in, foreign, policy, were, towards, a, reconciliation, with, the, normans, of, robert, guiscard, in, the, end, the, two, parties, did, not, meet, after, a, failed, call, for, a, crusade, to, the, princes, of, northern, europe, and, after, obtaining, the, support, of, other, norman, princes, such, as, landulf, vi, of, benevento, and, richard, i, of, capua, gregory, vii, was, able, to, excommunicate, robert, in, 1074, in, the, same, year, gregory, vii, summoned, a, council, in, the, lateran, palace, which, condemned, simony, and, confirmed, celibacy, for, the, church, s, clergy, these, decrees, were, further, stressed, under, menace, of, excommunication, the, next, year, 24, 28, february, in, particular, gregory, decreed, that, only, the, pope, could, appoint, or, depose, bishops, or, move, them, from, see, to, see, an, act, which, was, later, to, cause, the, investiture, controversy, gregory, vii, s, main, political, project, was, his, relationship, with, the, holy, roman, empire, since, the, death, of, holy, roman, emperor, henry, iii, the, strength, of, the, german, monarchy, had, been, seriously, weakened, and, his, untried, son, henry, iv, had, to, contend, with, great, internal, difficulties, presenting, an, opportunity, for, gregory, to, strengthen, the, church, in, the, two, years, following, gregory, s, election, the, saxon, rebellion, fully, occupied, henry, and, forced, him, to, come, to, terms, with, the, pope, at, any, cost, in, may, 1074, henry, did, penance, at, nuremberg, in, the, presence, of, the, papal, legates, to, atone, for, his, continued, friendship, with, the, members, of, his, council, who, had, been, banned, by, gregory, he, took, an, oath, of, obedience, and, promised, his, support, in, the, work, of, reforming, the, church, however, as, soon, as, henry, defeated, the, saxons, at, the, first, battle, of, langensalza, on, 9, june, 1075, battle, of, homburg, or, hohenburg, he, tried, to, reassert, his, sovereign, rights, in, northern, italy, henry, sent, count, eberhard, to, lombardy, to, combat, the, patarenes, nominated, the, cleric, tedald, to, the, archbishopric, of, milan, settling, a, prolonged, and, contentious, question, and, made, overtures, to, the, norman, duke, robert, guiscard, gregory, vii, replied, with, a, harsh, letter, dated, 8, december, 1075, in, which, he, accused, henry, of, breaching, his, word, and, of, continuing, to, support, excommunicated, councillors, at, the, same, time, the, pope, sent, a, verbal, message, threatening, not, only, the, ban, of, the, church, against, the, emperor, but, the, deprivation, of, his, crown, at, the, same, time, gregory, was, menaced, by, cencio, i, frangipane, who, on, christmas, night, surprised, him, in, church, and, kidnapped, him, though, he, was, released, the, following, day, the, high, handed, demands, and, threats, of, the, pope, infuriated, henry, and, his, court, and, their, answer, was, the, hastily, convened, national, synod, of, worms, on, 24, january, 1076, in, the, higher, ranks, of, the, german, clergy, gregory, had, many, enemies, and, the, roman, cardinal, hugo, candidus, once, on, intimate, terms, with, gregory, but, now, his, opponent, hurried, to, germany, for, the, occasion, candidus, declaimed, a, list, of, accusations, against, the, pope, before, the, assembly, which, resolved, that, gregory, had, forfeited, the, papacy, in, one, document, full, of, accusations, the, bishops, renounced, their, allegiance, to, gregory, in, another, henry, pronounced, him, deposed, and, required, the, romans, to, choose, a, new, pope, the, council, sent, two, bishops, to, italy, who, then, procured, a, similar, act, of, deposition, from, the, lombard, bishops, at, the, synod, of, piacenza, roland, of, parma, faced, the, pope, with, these, decisions, before, the, synod, which, had, just, assembled, in, the, lateran, basilica, for, the, moment, the, members, were, frightened, but, there, soon, arose, such, a, storm, of, indignation, that, only, the, calming, words, of, gregory, saved, the, envoy, s, life, on, the, following, day, 22, february, 1076, gregory, solemnly, pronounced, a, sentence, of, excommunication, against, henry, iv, divested, him, of, his, royal, dignity, and, absolved, his, subjects, of, their, sworn, allegiance, the, effectiveness, of, this, sentence, depended, entirely, on, henry, s, subjects, above, all, on, the, german, princes, contemporary, evidence, suggests, that, the, excommunication, of, henry, made, a, profound, impression, both, in, germany, and, italy, thirty, years, before, henry, iii, had, deposed, three, unworthy, claimants, to, the, papacy, a, service, acknowledged, by, the, church, and, public, opinion, when, henry, iv, again, attempted, this, procedure, he, lacked, support, in, germany, there, was, a, rapid, and, general, feeling, in, favor, of, gregory, strengthening, the, princes, against, their, feudal, lord, henry, when, at, whitsun, the, emperor, summoned, a, council, of, nobles, to, oppose, the, pope, only, a, few, responded, meanwhile, the, saxons, snatched, the, opportunity, to, renew, their, rebellion, and, the, anti, royalist, party, grew, in, strength, from, month, to, month, henry, now, faced, ruin, as, a, result, of, the, agitation, which, was, zealously, fostered, by, the, papal, legate, bishop, altmann, of, passau, the, princes, met, in, october, at, trebur, to, elect, a, new, german, ruler, henry, who, was, stationed, at, oppenheim, on, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, was, only, saved, from, the, loss, of, his, throne, by, the, failure, of, the, assembled, princes, to, agree, on, his, successor, their, dissension, however, merely, postponed, the, verdict, henry, they, declared, must, make, reparation, and, obeisance, to, gregory, and, if, he, were, still, under, the, ban, on, the, anniversary, of, his, excommunication, his, throne, should, be, considered, vacant, at, the, same, time, invited, gregory, to, augsburg, to, decide, the, conflict, unable, to, oppose, his, princes, and, the, pope, together, henry, saw, that, he, must, secure, absolution, from, gregory, before, the, period, named, at, first, he, attempted, this, through, an, embassy, but, when, gregory, rejected, his, overtures, he, went, to, italy, in, person, the, pope, had, already, left, rome, and, had, informed, the, german, princes, that, he, would, expect, their, escort, on, 8, january, 1077, to, mantua, this, escort, had, not, appeared, when, he, received, the, news, of, henry, s, arrival, at, canossa, where, gregory, had, taken, refuge, under, the, protection, of, his, close, ally, matilda, of, tuscany, henry, had, travelled, through, burgundy, greeted, with, enthusiasm, by, the, lombards, but, he, resisted, the, temptation, to, employ, force, in, an, astonishing, turn, the, emperor, mortified, his, pride, and, abased, himself, in, the, snow, to, do, penance, before, the, pope, this, immediately, reversed, the, moral, situation, forcing, gregory, to, grant, henry, absolution, the, walk, to, canossa, soon, became, legendary, the, reconciliation, was, only, effected, after, prolonged, negotiations, and, definite, pledges, on, the, part, of, henry, and, it, was, with, reluctance, that, gregory, vii, at, length, gave, way, considering, the, political, implications, if, gregory, vii, granted, absolution, the, diet, of, princes, in, augsburg, which, had, called, on, him, as, arbitrator, would, be, rendered, impotent, it, was, impossible, however, to, deny, the, penitent, re, entrance, into, the, church, and, gregory, vii, s, christian, duty, overrode, his, political, interests, the, removal, of, the, ban, did, not, imply, a, genuine, settlement, as, there, was, no, mention, of, the, main, question, between, pope, and, emperor, that, of, investiture, a, new, conflict, was, inevitable, obedience, to, the, excommunication, of, henry, iv, was, used, as, a, pretext, to, legitimize, the, rebellion, of, the, german, nobles, which, did, not, end, with, his, absolution, to, the, contrary, at, forchheim, in, march, 1077, they, elected, a, rival, ruler, in, the, person, of, duke, rudolf, of, swabia, with, the, papal, legates, declaring, their, neutrality, pope, gregory, sought, to, maintain, this, attitude, during, the, following, years, balancing, the, two, parties, of, fairly, equal, strength, each, trying, to, gain, the, upper, hand, by, getting, the, pope, on, their, side, in, the, end, his, non, commitment, largely, lost, the, confidence, of, both, parties, finally, he, decided, for, rudolf, of, swabia, after, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, flarchheim, on, 27, january, 1080, under, pressure, from, the, saxons, and, misinformed, as, to, the, significance, of, this, battle, gregory, abandoned, his, waiting, policy, and, again, pronounced, the, excommunication, and, deposition, of, henry, on, 7, march, 1080, the, papal, censure, now, got, a, very, different, reception, from, the, one, four, years, before, it, was, widely, felt, to, be, unjustly, pronounced, on, frivolous, grounds, and, its, authority, came, in, question, the, emperor, now, more, experienced, vigorously, denounced, the, ban, as, illegal, he, summoned, a, council, at, brixen, and, on, 25, june, 1080, thirty, bishops, present, pronounced, gregory, deposed, electing, archbishop, guibert, wibert, of, ravenna, as, his, successor, gregory, countered, on, 15, october, ordering, the, clergy, and, laity, to, elect, a, new, archbishop, in, place, of, the, mad, and, tyrannical, schismatic, wibert, in, 1081, henry, opened, the, conflict, against, gregory, in, italy, the, emperor, was, now, in, the, stronger, position, as, thirteen, cardinals, had, deserted, the, pope, and, the, rival, emperor, rudolf, of, swabia, died, on, 16, october, a, new, imperial, claimant, hermann, of, luxembourg, was, put, forward, in, august, 1081, but, he, was, unable, to, rally, the, papal, party, in, germany, and, the, power, of, henry, iv, was, at, its, peak, the, pope, s, chief, military, supporter, matilda, of, tuscany, blocked, henry, s, armies, from, the, western, passages, over, the, apennines, so, he, had, to, approach, rome, from, ravenna, rome, surrendered, to, the, german, king, in, 1084, and, gregory, thereupon, retired, into, the, exile, of, the, castel, sant, angelo, gregory, refused, to, entertain, henry, s, overtures, although, the, latter, promised, to, hand, over, guibert, as, a, prisoner, if, the, sovereign, pontiff, would, only, consent, to, crown, him, emperor, gregory, however, insisted, that, henry, appear, before, a, council, and, do, penance, the, emperor, while, pretending, to, submit, to, these, terms, tried, hard, to, prevent, the, meeting, of, the, council, a, small, number, of, bishops, assembled, nonetheless, and, gregory, again, excommunicated, henry, henry, upon, receipt, of, this, news, again, entered, rome, on, 21, march, to, see, that, his, supporter, archbishop, guibert, of, ravenna, was, enthroned, as, pope, clement, iii, on, 24, march, 1084, who, in, turn, crowned, henry, as, emperor, in, the, meantime, gregory, had, formed, an, alliance, with, robert, guiscard, who, marched, on, the, city, and, compelled, henry, to, flee, towards, civita, castellana, the, pope, was, liberated, but, after, the, roman, people, became, incensed, by, the, excesses, of, his, norman, allies, again, withdrew, to, monte, cassino, and, later, to, the, castle, of, salerno, by, the, sea, where, he, died, on, 25, may, 1085, three, days, before, his, death, he, withdrew, all, the, censures, of, excommunication, that, he, had, pronounced, except, those, against, the, two, chief, offenders, henry, and, guibert, in, 1076, gregory, appointed, dol, euen, a, monk, of, saint, melaine, of, rennes, as, bishop, of, dol, rejecting, both, the, incumbent, iuthael, who, had, the, support, of, william, the, conqueror, who, had, recently, been, conducting, military, operations, in, north, eastern, brittany, and, gilduin, the, candidate, of, the, nobles, in, dol, opposing, william, gregory, rejected, iuthael, because, he, was, notorious, for, simony, and, guilden, as, too, young, gregory, also, bestowed, on, dol, euen, the, pallium, of, a, metropolitan, archbishop, on, the, condition, that, he, would, submit, to, the, judgment, of, the, holy, see, when, the, long, standing, case, of, the, right, of, dol, to, be, a, metropolitan, and, use, the, pallium, was, finally, decided, king, william, felt, himself, so, safe, that, he, interfered, autocratically, with, the, management, of, the, church, forbade, the, bishops, to, visit, rome, made, appointments, to, bishoprics, and, abbeys, and, showed, little, anxiety, when, the, pope, lectured, him, on, the, different, principles, which, he, had, as, to, the, relationship, of, spiritual, and, temporal, powers, or, when, he, prohibited, him, from, commerce, or, commanded, him, to, acknowledge, himself, a, vassal, of, the, apostolic, chair, william, was, particularly, annoyed, at, gregory, s, insistence, on, dividing, ecclesiastical, england, into, two, provinces, in, opposition, to, william, s, need, to, emphasize, the, unity, of, his, newly, acquired, kingdom, gregory, s, increasing, insistence, on, church, independence, from, secular, authority, in, the, matter, of, clerical, appointments, became, a, more, and, more, contentious, issue, he, sought, as, well, to, compel, the, episcopacy, to, look, to, rome, for, validation, and, direction, demanding, the, regular, attendance, of, prelates, in, rome, gregory, had, no, power, to, compel, the, english, king, to, an, alteration, in, his, ecclesiastical, policy, so, he, was, compelled, to, ignore, what, he, could, not, approve, and, even, considered, it, advisable, to, assure, king, william, of, his, particular, affection, on, the, whole, william, s, policy, was, of, great, benefit, to, the, church, the, relationship, of, gregory, vii, to, other, european, states, was, strongly, influenced, by, his, german, policy, since, the, holy, roman, empire, by, taking, up, most, of, his, energies, often, forced, him, to, show, to, other, rulers, the, very, moderation, which, he, withheld, from, the, german, king, the, attitude, of, the, normans, brought, him, a, rude, awakening, the, great, concessions, made, to, them, under, nicholas, ii, were, not, only, powerless, to, stem, their, advance, into, central, italy, but, failed, to, secure, even, the, expected, protection, for, the, papacy, when, gregory, vii, was, hard, pressed, by, henry, iv, robert, guiscard, left, him, to, his, fate, and, only, intervened, when, he, himself, was, threatened, with, german, arms, then, on, the, capture, of, rome, he, abandoned, the, city, to, his, troops, and, the, popular, indignation, evoked, by, his, act, brought, about, gregory, s, exile, in, the, case, of, several, countries, gregory, vii, tried, to, establish, a, claim, of, sovereignty, on, the, part, of, the, papacy, and, to, secure, the, recognition, of, its, self, asserted, rights, of, possession, on, the, ground, of, immemorial, usage, corsica, and, sardinia, were, assumed, to, belong, to, the, roman, church, spain, hungary, and, croatia, were, also, claimed, as, her, property, and, an, attempt, was, made, to, induce, the, king, of, denmark, to, hold, his, realm, as, a, fief, from, the, pope, in, his, treatment, of, ecclesiastical, policy, and, ecclesiastical, reform, gregory, did, not, stand, alone, but, found, powerful, support, in, england, archbishop, lanfranc, of, canterbury, stood, closest, to, him, in, france, his, champion, was, bishop, hugh, de, di, who, afterwards, became, archbishop, of, lyon, philip, i, of, france, by, his, practice, of, simony, and, the, violence, of, his, proceedings, against, the, church, provoked, a, threat, of, summary, measures, excommunication, deposition, and, the, interdict, appeared, to, be, imminent, in, 1074, gregory, however, refrained, from, translating, his, threats, into, actions, although, the, attitude, of, the, king, showed, no, change, for, he, wished, to, avoid, a, dispersion, of, his, strength, in, the, conflict, soon, to, break, out, in, germany, pope, gregory, attempted, to, organize, a, crusade, into, al, andalus, led, by, count, ebles, ii, of, roucy, gregory, in, fact, established, some, sort, of, relations, with, every, country, in, christendom, though, these, relations, did, not, invariably, realize, the, ecclesiastico, political, hopes, connected, with, them, his, correspondence, extended, to, poland, kievan, rus, and, bohemia, he, unsuccessfully, tried, to, bring, armenia, into, closer, contact, with, rome, gregory, was, particularly, concerned, with, the, east, the, schism, between, rome, and, the, byzantine, empire, was, a, severe, blow, to, him, and, he, worked, hard, to, restore, the, former, amicable, relationship, gregory, successfully, tried, to, get, in, touch, with, the, emperor, michael, vii, when, the, news, of, the, muslim, attacks, on, the, christians, in, the, east, filtered, through, to, rome, and, the, political, embarrassments, of, the, byzantine, emperor, increased, he, conceived, the, project, of, a, great, military, expedition, and, exhorted, the, faithful, to, participate, in, recovering, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, foreshadowing, the, first, crusade, in, his, efforts, to, recruit, for, the, expedition, he, emphasized, the, suffering, of, eastern, christians, arguing, western, christians, had, a, moral, obligation, to, go, to, their, aid, his, lifework, was, based, on, his, conviction, that, the, church, was, founded, by, god, and, entrusted, with, the, task, of, embracing, all, mankind, in, a, single, society, in, which, divine, will, is, the, only, law, that, in, its, capacity, as, a, divine, institution, it, is, supreme, over, all, human, structures, especially, the, secular, state, and, that, the, pope, in, his, role, as, head, of, the, church, is, the, vice, regent, of, god, on, earth, so, that, disobedience, to, him, implies, disobedience, to, god, or, in, other, words, a, defection, from, christianity, but, any, attempt, to, interpret, this, in, terms, of, action, would, have, bound, the, church, to, annihilate, not, merely, a, single, state, but, all, states, thus, gregory, vii, as, a, politician, wanting, to, achieve, some, result, was, driven, in, practice, to, adopt, a, different, standpoint, he, acknowledged, the, existence, of, the, state, as, a, dispensation, of, providence, described, the, coexistence, of, church, and, state, as, a, divine, ordinance, and, emphasized, the, necessity, of, union, between, the, sacerdotium, and, the, imperium, but, at, no, period, would, he, have, dreamed, of, putting, the, two, powers, on, an, equal, footing, the, superiority, of, church, to, state, was, to, him, a, fact, which, admitted, of, no, discussion, and, which, he, had, never, doubted, he, wished, to, see, all, important, matters, of, dispute, referred, to, rome, appeals, were, to, be, addressed, to, himself, the, centralization, of, ecclesiastical, government, in, rome, naturally, involved, a, curtailment, of, the, powers, of, bishops, since, these, refused, to, submit, voluntarily, and, tried, to, assert, their, traditional, independence, his, papacy, is, full, of, struggles, against, the, higher, ranks, of, the, clergy, pope, gregory, vii, was, critical, in, promoting, and, regulating, the, concept, of, modern, university, as, his, 1079, papal, decree, ordered, the, regulated, establishment, of, cathedral, schools, that, transformed, themselves, into, the, first, european, universities, this, battle, for, the, foundation, of, papal, supremacy, is, connected, with, his, championship, of, compulsory, celibacy, among, the, clergy, and, his, attack, on, simony, gregory, vii, did, not, introduce, the, celibacy, of, the, priesthood, into, the, church, but, he, took, up, the, struggle, with, greater, energy, than, his, predecessors, in, 1074, he, published, an, encyclical, absolving, the, people, from, their, obedience, to, bishops, who, allowed, married, priests, the, next, year, he, enjoined, them, to, take, action, against, married, priests, and, deprived, these, clerics, of, their, revenues, both, the, campaign, against, priestly, marriage, and, that, against, simony, provoked, widespread, resistance, his, writings, treat, mainly, of, the, principles, and, practice, of, church, government, they, may, be, found, in, mansi, s, collection, under, the, title, gregorii, vii, registri, sive, epistolarum, libri, most, of, his, surviving, letters, are, preserved, in, his, register, which, is, now, stored, in, the, vatican, archives, gregory, vii, was, seen, by, pope, paul, vi, as, instrumental, in, affirming, the, tenet, that, christ, is, present, in, the, blessed, sacrament, gregory, s, demand, that, berengarius, perform, a, confession, of, this, belief, was, quoted, in, pope, paul, vi, s, historic, 1965, encyclical, mysterium, fidei, i, believe, in, my, heart, and, openly, profess, that, the, bread, and, wine, that, are, placed, on, the, altar, are, through, the, mystery, of, the, sacred, prayer, and, the, words, of, the, redeemer, substantially, changed, into, the, true, and, proper, and, lifegiving, flesh, and, blood, of, jesus, christ, our, lord, and, that, after, the, consecration, they, are, the, true, body, of, christ, this, profession, of, faith, began, a, eucharistic, renaissance, in, the, churches, of, europe,
