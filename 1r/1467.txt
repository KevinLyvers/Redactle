for, his, brother, initially, only, temporarily, but, after, october, on, a, permanent, basis, against, the, advice, of, his, brother, william, swore, an, oath, of, office, on, the, prussian, constitution, and, promised, to, preserve, it, solid, and, inviolable, william, appointed, a, liberal, karl, anton, von, hohenzollern, sigmaringen, as, minister, president, and, thus, initiated, what, became, known, as, the, new, era, in, prussia, although, there, were, conflicts, between, william, and, the, liberal, majority, in, the, landtag, on, matters, of, reforming, the, armed, forces, on, 2, january, 1861, frederick, william, iv, died, and, william, ascended, the, throne, as, william, i, of, prussia, in, july, a, student, from, leipzig, attempted, to, assassinate, william, but, he, was,

of, leipzig, 18, october, for, this, event, which, was, the, first, prussian, coronation, ceremony, since, 1701, and, the, only, coronation, of, a, german, king, after, 1806, william, refused, to, comply, with, his, brother, s, wish, expressed, in, frederick, william, s, last, will, that, he, should, abrogate, the, constitution, william, inherited, a, conflict, between, frederick, william, and, the, liberal, landtag, he, was, considered, to, be, politically, neutral, as, he, intervened, less, in, politics, than, his, brother, in, 1862, the, landtag, refused, an, increase, in, the, military, budget, needed, to, pay, for, the, already, implemented, reform, of, the, army, this, involved, expanding, the, peacetime, army, from, 150, 000, to, 200, 000, men, and, the, annual, number, of, new, recruits, from, 40, 000, to, 63, 000, however, the, truly, controversial, part, was, keeping, the, length, of, military, service, raised, in, 1856, from, two, years, at, three, years, when, his, request, backed, by, his, minister, of, war, albrecht, von, roon, was, refused, william, first, considered, abdicating, but, his, son, the, crown, prince, advised, strongly, against, it, then, on, the, advice, of, roon, william, appointed, otto, von, bismarck, as, minister, president, in, order, to, force, through, the, proposals, under, the, prussian, constitution, the, minister, president, was, responsible, solely, to, the, king, not, to, the, landtag, bismarck, a, conservative, prussian, junker, and, loyal, friend, of, the, king, liked, to, see, his, working, relationship, with, william, as, that, of, a, vassal, to, his, feudal, superior, nonetheless, it, was, bismarck, who, effectively, directed, affairs, domestic, as, well, as, foreign, on, several, occasions, he, gained, william, s, assent, by, threatening, to, resign, during, his, reign, william, was, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, prussian, forces, in, the, second, schleswig, war, against, denmark, in, 1864, and, the, austro, prussian, war, in, 1866, after, the, latter, was, won, by, prussia, william, wanted, to, march, on, to, vienna, and, annex, austria, but, was, dissuaded, from, doing, so, by, bismarck, and, his, son, crown, prince, frederick, bismarck, wanted, to, end, the, war, quickly, so, as, to, allow, prussia, to, ally, with, austria, if, it, needed, to, at, a, later, date, frederick, was, also, appalled, by, the, casualties, and, wanted, a, speedy, end, to, hostilities, during, a, heated, discussion, bismarck, threatened, to, resign, if, william, continued, to, vienna, bismarck, got, his, way, william, had, to, content, himself, with, becoming, the, de, facto, ruler, of, the, northern, two, thirds, of, germany, prussia, annexed, several, of, austria, s, allies, north, of, the, main, as, well, as, schleswig, holstein, saxe, lauenburg, was, already, in, a, personal, union, with, prussia, since, 1865, which, became, a, full, union, in, 1876, in, 1867, the, north, german, confederation, was, created, as, a, federation, federally, organised, state, of, the, north, german, and, central, german, states, under, the, permanent, presidency, of, prussia, william, assumed, the, bundespr, sidium, the, presidium, of, the, confederation, the, post, was, a, hereditary, office, of, the, prussian, crown, not, expressis, verbis, but, in, function, he, was, the, head, of, state, bismarck, intentionally, avoided, a, title, such, as, pr, sident, as, it, sounded, too, republican, william, became, also, the, constitutional, bundesfeldherr, the, commander, of, all, federal, armed, forces, via, secret, treaties, with, the, south, german, states, he, also, became, commander, of, their, armies, in, times, of, war, in, 1870, during, the, franco, prussian, war, william, was, in, command, of, all, the, german, forces, at, the, crucial, battle, of, sedan, during, the, franco, prussian, war, the, south, german, states, joined, the, north, german, confederation, which, was, reorganized, as, the, german, empire, deutsches, reich, the, title, of, bundespr, sidium, was, replaced, with, the, title, of, german, emperor, deutscher, kaiser, this, was, decided, on, by, the, legislative, organs, the, reichstag, and, bundesrat, and, william, agreed, to, this, on, 8, december, in, the, presence, of, a, reichstag, delegation, the, new, constitution, and, the, title, of, emperor, came, into, effect, on, 1, january, 1871, william, however, hesitated, to, accept, the, constitutional, title, as, he, feared, that, it, would, overshadow, his, own, title, as, king, of, prussia, he, also, wanted, it, to, be, kaiser, von, deutschland, emperor, of, germany, but, bismarck, warned, him, that, the, south, german, princes, and, the, emperor, of, austria, might, protest, william, eventually, though, grudgingly, relented, and, on, 18, january, he, was, formally, proclaimed, as, emperor, in, the, hall, of, mirrors, in, the, palace, of, versailles, the, date, was, chosen, as, the, coronation, date, of, the, first, prussian, king, in, 1701, in, the, national, memory, 18, january, became, the, day, of, the, foundation, of, the, empire, reichsgr, ndungstag, although, it, did, not, have, a, constitutional, significance, to, many, intellectuals, the, coronation, of, william, was, associated, with, the, restoration, of, the, holy, roman, empire, felix, dahn, wrote, a, poem, macte, senex, imperator, hail, thee, old, emperor, in, which, he, nicknamed, william, barbablanca, whitebeard, a, play, on, the, name, of, the, medieval, emperor, frederick, barbarossa, redbeard, according, to, the, king, asleep, in, mountain, legend, barbarossa, slept, under, the, kyffh, user, mountain, until, germany, had, need, of, him, william, i, was, thus, portrayed, as, a, second, coming, of, barbarossa, the, kyffh, user, monument, portrays, both, emperors, in, 1872, he, arbitrated, a, boundary, dispute, between, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, deciding, in, favor, of, the, u, s, and, placing, the, san, juan, islands, of, modern, day, washington, within, u, s, national, territory, thus, ending, the, 12, year, bloodless, pig, war, in, his, memoirs, bismarck, describes, william, as, an, old, fashioned, courteous, infallibly, polite, gentleman, and, a, genuine, prussian, officer, whose, good, common, sense, was, occasionally, undermined, by, female, influences, this, was, a, reference, to, william, s, wife, who, had, been, educated, by, among, others, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, and, was, intellectually, superior, to, her, husband, she, was, also, at, times, very, outspoken, in, her, opposition, to, official, policies, as, she, was, a, liberal, william, however, had, long, been, strongly, opposed, to, liberal, ideas, despite, possessing, considerable, power, as, kaiser, william, left, the, task, of, governing, mostly, to, his, chancellor, limiting, himself, to, representing, the, state, and, approving, bismarck, s, every, policy, in, private, he, once, remarked, on, his, relationship, with, bismarck, it, is, difficult, to, be, emperor, under, such, a, chancellor, on, 11, may, 1878, a, plumber, named, emil, max, h, del, failed, in, an, assassination, attempt, on, william, in, berlin, h, del, used, a, revolver, to, shoot, at, the, then, 81, year, old, emperor, while, he, and, his, daughter, princess, louise, paraded, in, their, carriage, on, unter, den, linden, when, the, bullet, missed, h, del, ran, across, the, street, and, fired, another, round, which, also, missed, in, the, commotion, one, of, the, individuals, who, tried, to, apprehend, h, del, suffered, severe, internal, injuries, and, died, two, days, later, h, del, was, seized, immediately, he, was, tried, convicted, sentenced, to, death, and, executed, on, 16, august, 1878, a, second, attempt, to, assassinate, william, i, was, made, on, 2, june, 1878, by, karl, nobiling, as, the, emperor, drove, past, in, an,

the, palace, nobiling, shot, himself, in, an, attempt, to, commit, suicide, while, william, survived, this, attack, the, assassin, died, from, his, self, inflicted, wound, three, months, later, despite, the, fact, that, h, del, had, been, expelled, from, the, social, democratic, party, his, actions, were, used, as, a, pretext, by, bismarck, to, ban, the, party, to, do, this, bismarck, partnered, with, ludwig, bamberger, a, liberal, who, had, written, on, the, subject, of, socialism, if, i, don, t, want, any, chickens, then, i, must, smash, the, eggs, these, attempts, on, william, s, life, thus, became, the, pretext, for, the, institution, of, the, anti, socialist, laws, which, were, introduced, by, bismarck, s, government, with, the, support, of, a, majority, in, the, reichstag, on, 18, october, 1878, for, the, purpose, of, fighting, the, socialist, and, working, class, movement, these, laws, deprived, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, of, its, legal, status, prohibited, all, organizations, workers, mass, organizations, and, the, socialist, and, workers, press, decreed, confiscation, of, socialist, literature, and, subjected, social, democrats, to, reprisals, the, laws, were, extended, every, 2, 3, years, despite, the, reprisals, the, social, democratic, party, increased, its, influence, among, the, masses, under, pressure, of, the, mass, working, class, movement, the, laws, were, repealed, on, 1, october, 1890, in, august, 1878, alexander, ii, of, russia, william, s, nephew, wrote, a, letter, known, as, ohrfeigenbrief, to, him, complaining, about, the, treatment, russian, interests, had, received, at, the, congress, of, berlin, in, response, william, his, wife, augusta, and, his, son, the, crown, prince, travelled, to, russia, against, the, advice, of, bismarck, to, mend, fences, in, face, to, face, talks, however, by, once, again, threatening, to, resign, bismarck, overcame, the, opposition, of, william, to, a, closer, alliance, with, austria, hungary, in, october, william, agreed, to, the, dual, alliance, zweibund, between, germany, and, austria, hungary, which, was, directed, against, russia, another, assassination, attempt, failed, on, 28, september, 1883, when, william, unveiled, the, niederwalddenkmal, in, r, desheim, a, group, of, anarchists, had, prepared, an, attack, using, dynamite, which, failed, due, to, the, wet, weather, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, 85, organized, by, otto, von, bismarck, can, be, seen, as, the, formalization, of, the, scramble, for, africa, claiming, much, of, the, left, over, territories, in, africa, and, oceania, that, were, yet, unclaimed, germany, managed, to, build, the, large, german, colonial, empire, despite, the, assassination, attempts, and, william, s, unpopular, role, in, the, 1848, uprising, he, and, his, wife, were, very, popular, especially, in, their, later, years, many, people, considered, them, the, personification, of, the, old,
