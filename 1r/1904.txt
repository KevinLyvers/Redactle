greatest, fame, as, a, slugging, outfielder, for, the, new, york, yankees, ruth, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, sports, heroes, in, american, culture, and, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, greatest, baseball, player, of, all, time, in, 1936, ruth, was, elected, to, the, baseball, hall, of, fame, as, one, of, its, first, five, inaugural, members, at, age, seven, ruth, was, sent, to,

baseball, player, in, 1914, ruth, was, signed, to, play, minor, league, baseball, for, the, baltimore, orioles, but, was, soon, sold, to, the, red, sox, by, 1916, he, had, built, a, reputation, as, an, outstanding, pitcher, who, sometimes, hit, long, home, runs, a, feat, unusual, for, any, player, in, the, dead, ball, era, although, ruth, twice, won, 23, games, in, a, season, as, a, pitcher, and, was, a, member, of, three, world, series, championship, teams, with, the, red, sox, he, wanted, to, play, every, day, and, was, allowed, to, convert, to, an, outfielder, with, regular, playing, time, he, broke, the, mlb, single, season, home, run, record, in, 1919, with, 29, after, that, season, red, sox, owner, harry, frazee, sold, ruth, to, the, yankees, amid, controversy, the, trade, fueled, boston, s, subsequent, 86, year, championship, drought, and, popularized, the, curse, of, the, bambino, superstition, in, his, 15, years, with, the, yankees, ruth, helped, the, team, win, seven, american, league, al, pennants, and, four, world, series, championships, his, big, swing, led, to, escalating, home, run, totals, that, not, only, drew, fans, to, the, ballpark, and, boosted, the, sport, s, popularity, but, also, helped, usher, in, baseball, s, live, ball, era, which, evolved, from, a, low, scoring, game, of, strategy, to, a, sport, where, the, home, run, was, a, major, factor, as, part, of, the, yankees, vaunted, murderers, row, lineup, of, 1927, ruth, hit, 60, home, runs, which, extended, his, own, mlb, single, season, record, by, a, single, home, run, ruth, s, last, season, with, the, yankees, was, 1934, and, he, retired, after, a, short, stint, with, the, boston, braves, the, following, year, in, his, career, he, led, the, al, in, home, runs, twelve, times, during, ruth, s, career, he, was, the, target, of, intense, press, and, public, attention, for, his, baseball, exploits, and, off, field, penchants, for, drinking, and, womanizing, after, his, retirement, as, a, player, he, was, denied, the, opportunity, to, manage, a, major, league, club, most, likely, because, of, poor, behavior, during, parts, of, his, playing, career, in, his, final, years, ruth, made, many, public, appearances, especially, in, support, of, american, efforts, in, world, war, ii, in, 1946, he, became, ill, with, nasopharyngeal, cancer, and, died, from, the, disease, two, years, later, ruth, remains, a, major, figure, in, american, culture, george, herman, ruth, jr, was, born, on, february, 6, 1895, at, 216, emory, street, in, the, pigtown, section, of, baltimore, in, a, house, which, belonged, to, his, maternal, grandfather, pius, schamberger, a, german, immigrant, and, trade, unionist, ruth, s, parents, katherine, n, e, schamberger, and, george, herman, ruth, sr, were, both, of, german, ancestry, according, to, the, 1880, census, his, parents, were, both, born, in, maryland, his, paternal, grandparents, were, from, prussia, and, hanover, germany, ruth, sr, worked, a, series, of, jobs, that, included, lightning, rod, salesman, and, streetcar, operator, the, elder, ruth, then, became, a, counterman, in, a, family, owned, combination, grocery, and, saloon, business, on, frederick, street, only, one, of, young, ruth, s, seven, siblings, his, younger, sister, mamie, survived, infancy, many, details, of, ruth, s, childhood, are, unknown, including, the, date, of, his, parents, marriage, as, a, child, ruth, spoke, german, when, ruth, was, a, toddler, the, family, moved, to, 339, south, woodyear, street, not, far, from, the, rail, yards, by, the, time, he, was, six, years, old, his, father, had, a, saloon, with, an, upstairs, apartment, at, 426, west, camden, street, details, are, equally, scanty, about, why, ruth, was, sent, at, the, age, of, seven, to, st, mary, s, industrial, school, for, boys, a, reformatory, and, orphanage, however, according, to, julia, ruth, stevens, recount, in, 1999, because, george, sr, was, a, saloon, owner, in, baltimore, and, had, given, ruth, little, supervision, growing, up, he, became, a, delinquent, ruth, was, sent, to, st, mary, s, because, george, sr, ran, out, of, ideas, to, discipline, and, mentor, his, son, as, an, adult, ruth, admitted, that, as, a, youth, he, ran, the, streets, rarely, attended, school, and, drank, beer, when, his, father, was, not, looking, some, accounts, say, that, following, a, violent, incident, at, his, father, s, saloon, the, city, authorities, decided, that, this, environment, was, unsuitable, for, a, small, child, ruth, entered, st, mary, s, on, june, 13, 1902, he, was, recorded, as, incorrigible, and, spent, much, of, the, next, 12, years, there, although, st, mary, s, boys, received, an, education, students, were, also, expected, to, learn, work, skills, and, help, operate, the, school, particularly, once, the, boys, turned, 12, ruth, became, a, shirtmaker, and, was, also, proficient, as, a, carpenter, he, would, adjust, his, own, shirt, collars, rather, than, having, a, tailor, do, so, even, during, his, well, paid, baseball, career, the, boys, aged, 5, to, 21, did, most, of, the, work, around, the, facility, from, cooking, to, shoemaking, and, renovated, st, mary, s, in, 1912, the, food, was, simple, and, the, xaverian, brothers, who, ran, the, school, insisted, on, strict, discipline, corporal, punishment, was, common, ruth, s, nickname, there, was, niggerlips, as, he, had, large, facial, features, and, was, darker, than, most, boys, at, the, all, white, reformatory, ruth, was, sometimes, allowed, to, rejoin, his, family, or, was, placed, at, st, james, s, home, a, supervised, residence, with, work, in, the, community, but, he, was, always, returned, to, st, mary, s, he, was, rarely, visited, by, his, family, his, mother, died, when, he, was, 12, and, by, some, accounts, he, was, permitted, to, leave, st, mary, s, only, to, attend, the, funeral, how, ruth, came, to, play, baseball, there, is, uncertain, according, to, one, account, his, placement, at, st, mary, s, was, due, in, part, to, repeatedly, breaking, baltimore, s, windows, with, long, hits, while, playing, street, ball, by, another, he, was, told, to, join, a, team, on, his, first, day, at, st, mary, s, by, the, school, s, athletic, director, brother, herman, becoming, a, catcher, even, though, left, handers, rarely, play, that, position, during, his, time, there, he, also, played, third, base, and, shortstop, again, unusual, for, a, left, hander, and, was, forced, to, wear, mitts, and, gloves, made, for, right, handers, he, was, encouraged, in, his, pursuits, by, the, school, s, prefect, of, discipline, brother, matthias, boutlier, a, native, of, nova, scotia, a, large, man, brother, matthias, was, greatly, respected, by, the, boys, both, for, his, strength, and, for, his, fairness, for, the, rest, of, his, life, ruth, would, praise, brother, matthias, and, his, running, and, hitting, styles, closely, resembled, his, teacher, s, ruth, stated, i, think, i, was, born, as, a, hitter, the, first, day, i, ever, saw, him, hit, a, baseball, the, older, man, became, a, mentor, and, role, model, to, ruth, biographer, robert, w, creamer, commented, on, the, closeness, between, the, two, ruth, revered, brother, matthias, which, is, remarkable, considering, that, matthias, was, in, charge, of, making, boys, behave, and, that, ruth, was, one, of, the, great, natural, misbehavers, of, all, time, george, ruth, caught, brother, matthias, attention, early, and, the, calm, considerable, attention, the, big, man, gave, the, young, hellraiser, from, the, waterfront, struck, a, spark, of, response, in, the, boy, s, soul, blunted, a, few, of, the, more, savage, teeth, in, the, gross, man, whom, i, have, heard, at, least, a, half, dozen, of, his, baseball, contemporaries, describe, with, admiring, awe, and, wonder, as, an, animal, the, school, s, influence, remained, with, ruth, in, other, ways, he, was, a, lifelong, catholic, who, would, sometimes, attend, mass, after, carousing, all, night, and, he, became, a, well, known, member, of, the, knights, of, columbus, he, would, visit, orphanages, schools, and, hospitals, throughout, his, life, often, avoiding, publicity, he, was, generous, to, st, mary, s, as, he, became, famous, and, rich, donating, money, and, his, presence, at, fundraisers, and, spending, 5, 000, to, buy, brother, matthias, a, cadillac, in, 1926, subsequently, replacing, it, when, it, was, destroyed, in, an, accident, nevertheless, his, biographer, leigh, montville, suggests, that, many, of, the, off, the, field, excesses, of, ruth, s, career, were, driven, by, the, deprivations, of, his, time, at, st, mary, s, most, of, the, boys, at, st, mary, s, played, baseball, in, organized, leagues, at, different, levels, of, proficiency, ruth, later, estimated, that, he, played, 200, games, a, year, as, he, steadily, climbed, the, ladder, of, success, although, he, played, all, positions, at, one, time, or, another, he, gained, stardom, as, a, pitcher, according, to, brother, matthias, ruth, was, standing, to, one, side, laughing, at, the, bumbling, pitching, efforts, of, fellow, students, and, matthias, told, him, to, go, in, and, see, if, he, could, do, better, ruth, had, become, the, best, pitcher, at, st, mary, s, and, when, he, was, 18, in, 1913, he, was, allowed, to, leave, the, premises, to, play, weekend, games, on, teams, that, were, drawn, from, the, community, he, was, mentioned, in, several, newspaper, articles, for, both, his, pitching, prowess, and, ability, to, hit, long, home, runs, in, early, 1914, ruth, signed, a, professional, baseball, contract, with, jack, dunn, who, owned, and, managed, the, minor, league, baltimore, orioles, an, international, league, team, the, circumstances, of, ruth, s, signing, are, not, known, with, certainty, by, some, accounts, dunn, was, urged, to, attend, a, game, between, an, all, star, team, from, st, mary, s, and, one, from, another, xaverian, facility, mount, st, mary, s, college, some, versions, have, ruth, running, away, before, the, eagerly, awaited, game, to, return, in, time, to, be, punished, and, then, pitching, st, mary, s, to, victory, as, dunn, watched, others, have, washington, senators, pitcher, joe, engel, a, mount, st, mary, s, graduate, pitching, in, an, alumni, game, after, watching, a, preliminary, contest, between, the, college, s, freshmen, and, a, team, from, st, mary, s, including, ruth, engel, watched, ruth, play, then, told, dunn, about, him, at, a, chance, meeting, in, washington, ruth, in, his, autobiography, stated, only, that, he, worked, out, for, dunn, for, a, half, hour, and, was, signed, according, to, biographer, kal, wagenheim, there, were, legal, difficulties, to, be, straightened, out, as, ruth, was, supposed, to, remain, at, the, school, until, he, turned, 21, though, sportscentury, stated, in, a, documentary, that, ruth, had, already, been, discharged, from, st, mary, s, when, he, turned, 19, and, earned, a, monthly, salary, of, 100, the, train, journey, to, spring, training, in, fayetteville, north, carolina, in, early, march, was, likely, ruth, s, first, outside, the, baltimore, area, the, rookie, ballplayer, was, the, subject, of, various, pranks, by, veteran, players, who, were, probably, also, the, source, of, his, famous, nickname, there, are, various, accounts, of, how, ruth, came, to, be, called, babe, but, most, center, on, his, being, referred, to, as, dunnie, s, babe, or, some, variant, sportscentury, reported, that, his, nickname, was, gained, because, he, was, the, new, darling, or, project, of, dunn, not, only, because, of, ruth, s, raw, talent, but, also, because, of, his, lack, of, knowledge, of, the, proper, etiquette, of, eating, out, in, a, restaurant, being, in, a, hotel, or, being, on, a, train, babe, was, at, that, time, a, common, nickname, in, baseball, with, perhaps, the, most, famous, to, that, point, being, pittsburgh, pirates, pitcher, and, 1909, world, series, hero, babe, adams, who, appeared, younger, than, his, actual, age, ruth, made, his, first, appearance, as, a, professional, ballplayer, in, an, inter, squad, game, on, march, 7, 1914, he, played, shortstop, and, pitched, the, last, two, innings, of, a, 15, 9, victory, in, his, second, at, bat, ruth, hit, a, long, home, run, to, right, field, the, blast, was, locally, reported, to, be, longer, than, a, legendary, shot, hit, by, jim, thorpe, in, fayetteville, ruth, made, his, first, appearance, against, a, team, in, organized, baseball, in, an, exhibition, game, versus, the, major, league, philadelphia, phillies, ruth, pitched, the, middle, three, innings, and, gave, up, two, runs, in, the, fourth, but, then, settled, down, and, pitched, a, scoreless, fifth, and, sixth, innings, in, a, game, against, the, phillies, the, following, afternoon, ruth, entered, during, the, sixth, inning, and, did, not, allow, a, run, the, rest, of, the, way, the, orioles, scored, seven, runs, in, the, bottom, of, the, eighth, inning, to, overcome, a, 6, 0, deficit, and, ruth, was, the, winning, pitcher, once, the, regular, season, began, ruth, was, a, star, pitcher, who, was, also, dangerous, at, the, plate, the, team, performed, well, yet, received, almost, no, attention, from, the, baltimore, press, a, third, major, league, the, federal, league, had, begun, play, and, the, local, franchise, the, baltimore, terrapins, restored, that, city, to, the, major, leagues, for, the, first, time, since, 1902, few, fans, visited, oriole, park, where, ruth, and, his, teammates, labored, in, relative, obscurity, ruth, may, have, been, offered, a, bonus, and, a, larger, salary, to, jump, to, the, terrapins, when, rumors, to, that, effect, swept, baltimore, giving, ruth, the, most, publicity, he, had, experienced, to, date, a, terrapins, official, denied, it, stating, it, was, their, policy, not, to, sign, players, under, contract, to, dunn, the, competition, from, the, terrapins, caused, dunn, to, sustain, large, losses, although, by, late, june, the, orioles, were, in, first, place, having, won, over, two, thirds, of, their, games, the, paid, attendance, dropped, as, low, as, 150, dunn, explored, a, possible, move, by, the, orioles, to, richmond, virginia, as, well, as, the, sale, of, a, minority, interest, in, the, club, these, possibilities, fell, through, leaving, dunn, with, little, choice, other, than, to, sell, his, best, players, to, major, league, teams, to, raise, money, he, offered, ruth, to, the, reigning, world, series, champions, connie, mack, s, philadelphia, athletics, but, mack, had, his, own, financial, problems, the, cincinnati, reds, and, new, york, giants, expressed, interest, in, ruth, but, dunn, sold, his, contract, along, with, those, of, pitchers, ernie, shore, and, ben, egan, to, the, boston, red, sox, of, the, american, league, al, on, july, 4, the, sale, price, was, announced, as, 25, 000, but, other, reports, lower, the, amount, to, half, that, or, possibly, 8, 500, plus, the, cancellation, of, a, 3, 000, loan, ruth, remained, with, the, orioles, for, several, days, while, the, red, sox, completed, a, road, trip, and, reported, to, the, team, in, boston, on, july, 11, on, july, 11, 1914, ruth, arrived, in, boston, with, egan, and, shore, ruth, later, told, the, story, of, how, that, morning, he, had, met, helen, woodford, who, would, become, his, first, wife, she, was, a, 16, year, old, waitress, at, landers, coffee, shop, and, ruth, related, that, she, served, him, when, he, had, breakfast, there, other, stories, though, suggested, that, the, meeting, occurred, on, another, day, and, perhaps, under, other, circumstances, regardless, of, when, he, began, to, court, his, first, wife, he, won, his, first, game, as, a, pitcher, for, the, red, sox, that, afternoon, 4, 3, over, the, cleveland, naps, his, catcher, was, bill, carrigan, who, was, also, the, red, sox, manager, shore, was, given, a, start, by, carrigan, the, next, day, he, won, that, and, his, second, start, and, thereafter, was, pitched, regularly, ruth, lost, his, second, start, and, was, thereafter, little, used, in, his, major, league, debut, as, a, batter, ruth, went, 0, for, 2, against, left, hander, willie, mitchell, striking, out, in, his, first, at, bat, before, being, removed, for, a, pinch, hitter, in, the, seventh, inning, ruth, was, not, much, noticed, by, the, fans, as, bostonians, watched, the, red, sox, s, crosstown, rivals, the, braves, begin, a, legendary, comeback, that, would, take, them, from, last, place, on, the, fourth, of, july, to, the, 1914, world, series, championship, egan, was, traded, to, cleveland, after, two, weeks, on, the, boston, roster, during, his, time, with, the, red, sox, he, kept, an, eye, on, the, inexperienced, ruth, much, as, dunn, had, in, baltimore, when, he, was, traded, no, one, took, his, place, as, supervisor, ruth, s, new, teammates, considered, him, brash, and, would, have, preferred, him, as, a, rookie, to, remain, quiet, and, inconspicuous, when, ruth, insisted, on, taking, batting, practice, despite, being, both, a, rookie, who, did, not, play, regularly, and, a, pitcher, he, arrived, to, find, his, bats, sawed, in, half, his, teammates, nicknamed, him, the, big, baboon, a, name, the, swarthy, ruth, who, had, disliked, the, nickname, niggerlips, at, st, mary, s, detested, ruth, had, received, a, raise, on, promotion, to, the, major, leagues, and, quickly, acquired, tastes, for, fine, food, liquor, and, women, among, other, temptations, manager, carrigan, allowed, ruth, to, pitch, two, exhibition, games, in, mid, august, although, ruth, won, both, against, minor, league, competition, he, was, not, restored, to, the, pitching, rotation, it, is, uncertain, why, carrigan, did, not, give, ruth, additional, opportunities, to, pitch, there, are, legends, filmed, for, the, screen, in, the, babe, ruth, story, 1948, that, the, young, pitcher, had, a, habit, of, signaling, his, intent, to, throw, a, curveball, by, sticking, out, his, tongue, slightly, and, that, he, was, easy, to, hit, until, this, changed, creamer, pointed, out, that, it, is, common, for, inexperienced, pitchers, to, display, such, habits, and, the, need, to, break, ruth, of, his, would, not, constitute, a, reason, to, not, use, him, at, all, the, biographer, suggested, that, carrigan, was, unwilling, to, use, ruth, because, of, the, rookie, s, poor, behavior, on, july, 30, 1914, boston, owner, joseph, lannin, had, purchased, the, minor, league, providence, grays, members, of, the, international, league, the, providence, team, had, been, owned, by, several, people, associated, with, the, detroit, tigers, including, star, hitter, ty, cobb, and, as, part, of, the, transaction, a, providence, pitcher, was, sent, to, the, tigers, to, soothe, providence, fans, upset, at, losing, a, star, lannin, announced, that, the, red, sox, would, soon, send, a, replacement, to, the, grays, this, was, intended, to, be, ruth, but, his, departure, for, providence, was, delayed, when, cincinnati, reds, owner, garry, herrmann, claimed, him, off, of, waivers, after, lannin, wrote, to, herrmann, explaining, that, the, red, sox, wanted, ruth, in, providence, so, he, could, develop, as, a, player, and, would, not, release, him, to, a, major, league, club, herrmann, allowed, ruth, to, be, sent, to, the, minors, carrigan, later, stated, that, ruth, was, not, sent, down, to, providence, to, make, him, a, better, player, but, to, help, the, grays, win, the, international, league, pennant, league, championship, ruth, joined, the, grays, on, august, 18, 1914, after, dunn, s, deals, the, baltimore, orioles, managed, to, hold, on, to, first, place, until, august, 15, after, which, they, continued, to, fade, leaving, the, pennant, race, between, providence, and, rochester, ruth, was, deeply, impressed, by, providence, manager, wild, bill, donovan, previously, a, star, pitcher, with, a, 25, 4, win, loss, record, for, detroit, in, 1907, in, later, years, he, credited, donovan, with, teaching, him, much, about, pitching, ruth, was, often, called, upon, to, pitch, in, one, stretch, starting, and, winning, four, games, in, eight, days, on, september, 5, at, maple, leaf, park, in, toronto, ruth, pitched, a, one, hit, 9, 0, victory, and, hit, his, first, professional, home, run, his, only, one, as, a, minor, leaguer, off, ellis, johnson, recalled, to, boston, after, providence, finished, the, season, in, first, place, he, pitched, and, won, a, game, for, the, red, sox, against, the, new, york, yankees, on, october, 2, getting, his, first, major, league, hit, a, double, ruth, finished, the, season, with, a, record, of, 2, 1, as, a, major, leaguer, and, 23, 8, in, the, international, league, for, baltimore, and, providence, once, the, season, concluded, ruth, married, helen, in, ellicott, city, maryland, creamer, speculated, that, they, did, not, marry, in, baltimore, where, the, newlyweds, boarded, with, george, ruth, sr, to, avoid, possible, interference, from, those, at, st, mary, s, both, bride, and, groom, were, not, yet, of, age, and, ruth, remained, on, parole, from, that, institution, until, his, 21st, birthday, in, march, 1915, ruth, reported, to, hot, springs, arkansas, for, his, first, major, league, spring, training, despite, a, relatively, successful, first, season, he, was, not, slated, to, start, regularly, for, the, red, sox, who, already, had, two, superb, left, handed, pitchers, according, to, creamer, the, established, stars, dutch, leonard, who, had, broken, the, record, for, the, lowest, earned, run, average, era, in, a, single, season, and, ray, collins, a, 20, game, winner, in, both, 1913, and, 1914, ruth, was, ineffective, in, his, first, start, taking, the, loss, in, the, third, game, of, the, season, injuries, and, ineffective, pitching, by, other, boston, pitchers, gave, ruth, another, chance, and, after, some, good, relief, appearances, carrigan, allowed, ruth, another, start, and, he, won, a, rain, shortened, seven, inning, game, ten, days, later, the, manager, had, him, start, against, the, new, york, yankees, at, the, polo, grounds, ruth, took, a, 3, 2, lead, into, the, ninth, but, lost, the, game, 4, 3, in, 13, innings, ruth, hitting, ninth, as, was, customary, for, pitchers, hit, a, massive, home, run, into, the, upper, deck, in, right, field, off, of, jack, warhop, at, the, time, home, runs, were, rare, in, baseball, and, ruth, s, majestic, shot, awed, the, crowd, the, winning, pitcher, warhop, would, in, august, 1915, conclude, a, major, league, career, of, eight, seasons, undistinguished, but, for, being, the, first, major, league, pitcher, to, give, up, a, home, run, to, babe, ruth, carrigan, was,

was, a, player, manager, and, who, joined, the, naval, reserve, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, the, draft, only, to, be, called, up, after, the, 1917, season, frazee, hired, international, league, president, ed, barrow, as, red, sox, manager, barrow, had, spent, the, previous, 30, years, in, a, variety, of, baseball, jobs, though, he, never, played, the, game, professionally, with, the, major, leagues, shorthanded, because, of, the, war, barrow, had, many, holes, in, the, red, sox, lineup, to, fill, ruth, also, noticed, these, vacancies, in, the, lineup, he, was, dissatisfied, in, the, role, of, a, pitcher, who, appeared, every, four, or, five, days, and, wanted, to, play, every, day, at, another, position, barrow, used, ruth, at, first, base, and, in, the, outfield, during, the, exhibition, season, but, he, restricted, him, to, pitching, as, the, team, moved, toward, boston, and, the, season, opener, at, the, time, ruth, was, possibly, the, best, left, handed, pitcher, in, baseball, and, allowing, him, to, play, another, position, was, an, experiment, that, could, have, backfired, inexperienced, as, a, manager, barrow, had, player, harry, hooper, advise, him, on, baseball, game, strategy, hooper, urged, his, manager, to, allow, ruth, to, play, another, position, when, he, was, not, pitching, arguing, to, barrow, who, had, invested, in, the, club, that, the, crowds, were, larger, on, days, when, ruth, played, as, they, were, attracted, by, his, hitting, in, early, may, barrow, gave, in, ruth, promptly, hit, home, runs, in, four, consecutive, games, one, an, exhibition, the, last, off, of, walter, johnson, for, the, first, time, in, his, career, disregarding, pinch, hitting, appearances, ruth, was, assigned, a, place, in, the, batting, order, higher, than, ninth, although, barrow, predicted, that, ruth, would, beg, to, return, to, pitching, the, first, time, he, experienced, a, batting, slump, that, did, not, occur, barrow, used, ruth, primarily, as, an, outfielder, in, the, war, shortened, 1918, season, ruth, hit, 300, with, 11, home, runs, enough, to, secure, him, a, share, of, the, major, league, home, run, title, with, tilly, walker, of, the, philadelphia, athletics, he, was, still, occasionally, used, as, a, pitcher, and, had, a, 13, 7, record, with, a, 2, 22, era, in, 1918, the, red, sox, won, their, third, pennant, in, four, years, and, faced, the, chicago, cubs, in, the, world, series, which, began, on, september, 5, the, earliest, date, in, history, the, season, had, been, shortened, because, the, government, had, ruled, that, baseball, players, who, were, eligible, for, the, military, would, have, to, be, inducted, or, work, in, critical, war, industries, such, as, armaments, plants, ruth, pitched, and, won, game, one, for, the, red, sox, a, 1, 0, shutout, before, game, four, ruth, injured, his, left, hand, in, a, fight, but, pitched, anyway, he, gave, up, seven, hits, and, six, walks, but, was, helped, by, outstanding, fielding, behind, him, and, by, his, own, batting, efforts, as, a, fourth, inning, triple, by, ruth, gave, his, team, a, 2, 0, lead, the, cubs, tied, the, game, in, the, eighth, inning, but, the, red, sox, scored, to, take, a, 3, 2, lead, again, in, the, bottom, of, that, inning, after, ruth, gave, up, a, hit, and, a, walk, to, start, the, ninth, inning, he, was, relieved, on, the, mound, by, joe, bush, to, keep, ruth, and, his, bat, in, the, game, he, was, sent, to, play, left, field, bush, retired, the, side, to, give, ruth, his, second, win, of, the, series, and, the, third, and, last, world, series, pitching, victory, of, his, career, against, no, defeats, in, three, pitching, appearances, ruth, s, effort, gave, his, team, a, three, games, to, one, lead, and, two, days, later, the, red, sox, won, their, third, series, in, four, years, four, games, to, two, before, allowing, the, cubs, to, score, in, game, four, ruth, pitched, 29, 2, 3, consecutive, scoreless, innings, a, record, for, the, world, series, that, stood, for, more, than, 40, years, until, 1961, broken, by, whitey, ford, after, ruth, s, death, ruth, was, prouder, of, that, record, than, he, was, of, any, of, his, batting, feats, with, the, world, series, over, ruth, gained, exemption, from, the, war, draft, by, accepting, a, nominal, position, with, a, pennsylvania, steel, mill, many,

contrivances, during, the, 1919, season, ruth, was, used, as, a, pitcher, in, only, 17, of, his, 130, games, and, compiled, a, 9, 5, record, barrow, used, him, as, a, pitcher, mostly, in, the, early, part, of, the, season, when, the, red, sox, manager, still, had, hopes, of, a, second, consecutive, pennant, by, late, june, the, red, sox, were, clearly, out, of, the, race, and, barrow, had, no, objection, to, ruth, concentrating, on, his, hitting, if, only, because, it, drew, people, to, the, ballpark, ruth, had, hit, a, home, run, against, the, yankees, on, opening, day, and, another, during, a, month, long, batting, slump, that, soon, followed, relieved, of, his, pitching, duties, ruth, began, an, unprecedented, spell, of, slugging, home, runs, which, gave, him, widespread, public, and, press, attention, even, his, failures, were, seen, as, majestic, one, sportswriter, said, when, ruth, misses, a, swipe, at, the, ball, the, stands, quiver, two, home, runs, by, ruth, on, july, 5, and, one, in, each, of, two, consecutive, games, a, week, later, raised, his, season, total, to, 11, tying, his, career, best, from, 1918, the, first, record, to, fall, was, the, al, single, season, mark, of, 16, set, by, ralph, socks, seybold, in, 1902, ruth, matched, that, on, july, 29, then, pulled, ahead, toward, the, major, league, record, of, 25, set, by, buck, freeman, in, 1899, by, the, time, ruth, reached, this, in, early, september, writers, had, discovered, that, ned, williamson, of, the, 1884, chicago, white, stockings, had, hit, 27, though, in, a, ballpark, where, the, distance, to, right, field, was, only, 215, feet, 66, m, on, september, 20, babe, ruth, day, at, fenway, park, ruth, won, the, game, with, a, home, run, in, the, bottom, of, the, ninth, inning, tying, williamson, he, broke, the, record, four, days, later, against, the, yankees, at, the, polo, grounds, and, hit, one, more, against, the, senators, to, finish, with, 29, the, home, run, at, washington, made, ruth, the, first, major, league, player, to, hit, a, home, run, at, all, eight, ballparks, in, his, league, in, spite, of, ruth, s, hitting, heroics, the, red, sox, finished, sixth, 20, 1, 2, games, behind, the, league, champion, white, sox, in, his, six, seasons, with, boston, he, won, 89, games, and, recorded, a, 2, 19, era, he, had, a, four, year, stretch, where, he, was, second, in, the, al, in, wins, and, era, behind, walter, johnson, and, ruth, had, a, winning, record, against, johnson, in, head, to, head, matchups, as, an, out, of, towner, from, new, york, city, frazee, had, been, regarded, with, suspicion, by, boston, s, sportswriters, and, baseball, fans, when, he, bought, the, team, he, won, them, over, with, success, on, the, field, and, a, willingness, to, build, the, red, sox, by, purchasing, or, trading, for, players, he, offered, the, senators, 60, 000, for, walter, johnson, but, washington, owner, clark, griffith, was, unwilling, even, so, frazee, was, successful, in, bringing, other, players, to, boston, especially, as, replacements, for, players, in, the, military, this, willingness, to, spend, for, players, helped, the, red, sox, secure, the, 1918, title, the, 1919, season, saw, record, breaking, attendance, and, ruth, s, home, runs, for, boston, made, him, a, national, sensation, in, march, 1919, ruth, was, reported, as, having, accepted, a, three, year, contract, for, a, total, of, 27, 000, after, protracted, negotiations, nevertheless, on, december, 26, 1919, frazee, sold, ruth, s, contract, to, the, new, york, yankees, not, all, the, circumstances, concerning, the, sale, are, known, but, brewer, and, former, congressman, jacob, ruppert, the, new, york, team, s, principal, owner, reportedly, asked, yankee, manager, miller, huggins, what, the, team, needed, to, be, successful, get, ruth, from, boston, huggins, supposedly, replied, noting, that, frazee, was, perennially, in, need, of, money, to, finance, his, theatrical, productions, in, any, event, there, was, precedent, for, the, ruth, transaction, when, boston, pitcher, carl, mays, left, the, red, sox, in, a, 1919, dispute, frazee, had, settled, the, matter, by, selling, mays, to, the, yankees, though, over, the, opposition, of, al, president, johnson, according, to, one, of, ruth, s, biographers, jim, reisler, why, frazee, needed, cash, in, 1919, and, large, infusions, of, it, quickly, is, still, more, than, 80, years, later, a, bit, of, a, mystery, the, often, told, story, is, that, frazee, needed, money, to, finance, the, musical, no, no, nanette, which, was, a, broadway, hit, and, brought, frazee, financial, security, that, play, did, not, open, until, 1925, however, by, which, time, frazee, had, sold, the, red, sox, however, frazee, did, need, the, money, to, finance, another, theatre, work, no, no, nanette, was, based, on, a, frazee, produced, play, my, lady, friends, which, opened, in, 1919, there, were, other, financial, pressures, on, frazee, despite, his, team, s, success, ruth, fully, aware, of, baseball, s, popularity, and, his, role, in, it, wanted, to, renegotiate, his, contract, signed, before, the, 1919, season, for, 10, 000, per, year, through, 1921, he, demanded, that, his, salary, be, doubled, or, he, would, sit, out, the, season, and, cash, in, on, his, popularity, through, other, ventures, ruth, s, salary, demands, were, causing, other, players, to, ask, for, more, money, additionally, frazee, still, owed, lannin, as, much, as, 125, 000, from, the, purchase, of, the, club, although, ruppert, and, his, co, owner, colonel, tillinghast, huston, were, both, wealthy, and, had, aggressively, purchased, and, traded, for, players, in, 1918, and, 1919, to, build, a, winning, team, ruppert, faced, losses, in, his, brewing, interests, as, prohibition, was, implemented, and, if, their, team, left, the, polo, grounds, where, the, yankees, were, the, tenants, of, the, new, york, giants, building, a, stadium, in, new, york, would, be, expensive, nevertheless, when, frazee, who, moved, in, the, same, social, circles, as, huston, hinted, to, the, colonel, that, ruth, was, available, for, the, right, price, the, yankees, owners, quickly, pursued, the, purchase, frazee, sold, the, rights, to, babe, ruth, for, 100, 000, the, largest, sum, ever, paid, for, a, baseball, player, the, deal, also, involved, a, 350, 000, loan, from, ruppert, to, frazee, secured, by, a, mortgage, on, fenway, park, once, it, was, agreed, frazee, informed, barrow, who, stunned, told, the, owner, that, he, was, getting, the, worse, end, of, the, bargain, cynics, have, suggested, that, barrow, may, have, played, a, larger, role, in, the, ruth, sale, as, less, than, a, year, after, he, became, the, yankee, general, manager, and, in, the, following, years, made, a, number, of, purchases, of, red, sox, players, from, frazee, the, 100, 000, price, included, 25, 000, in, cash, and, notes, for, the, same, amount, due, november, 1, in, 1920, 1921, and, 1922, ruppert, and, huston, assisted, frazee, in, selling, the, notes, to, banks, for, immediate, cash, the, transaction, was, contingent, on, ruth, signing, a, new, contract, which, was, quickly, accomplished, ruth, agreed, to, fulfill, the, remaining, two, years, on, his, contract, but, was, given, a, 20, 000, bonus, payable, over, two, seasons, the, deal, was, announced, on, january, 6, 1920, reaction, in, boston, was, mixed, some, fans, were, embittered, at, the, loss, of, ruth, others, conceded, that, ruth, had, become, difficult, to, deal, with, the, new, york, times, suggested, that, the, short, right, field, wall, at, the, polo, grounds, should, prove, an, easy, target, for, ruth, next, season, and, playing, seventy, seven, games, at, home, it, would, not, be, surprising, if, ruth, surpassed, his, home, run, record, of, twenty, nine, circuit, clouts, next, summer, according, to, reisler, the, yankees, had, pulled, off, the, sports, steal, of, the, century, according, to, marty, appel, in, his, history, of, the, yankees, the, transaction, changed, the, fortunes, of, two, high, profile, franchises, for, decades, the, red, sox, winners, of, five, of, the, first, 16, world, series, those, played, between, 1903, and, 1919, would, not, win, another, pennant, until, 1946, or, another, world, series, until, 2004, a, drought, attributed, in, baseball, superstition, to, frazee, s, sale, of, ruth, and, sometimes, dubbed, the, curse, of, the, bambino, conversely, the, yankees, had, not, won, the, al, championship, prior, to, their, acquisition, of, ruth, they, won, seven, al, pennants, and, four, world, series, with, him, and, lead, baseball, with, 40, pennants, and, 27, world, series, titles, in, their, history, when, ruth, signed, with, the, yankees, his, transition, from, a, pitcher, to, a, power, hitting, outfielder, was, complete, his, fifteen, season, yankee, career, consisted, of, over, 2, 000, games, and, ruth, broke, many, batting, records, while, making, only, five, widely, scattered, appearances, on, the, mound, winning, all, of, them, at, the, end, of, april, 1920, the, yankees, were, 4, 7, with, the, red, sox, leading, the, league, with, a, 10, 2, mark, ruth, had, done, little, having, injured, himself, swinging, the, bat, both, situations, began, to, change, on, may, 1, when, ruth, hit, a, tape, measure, home, run, that, sent, the, ball, completely, out, of, the, polo, grounds, a, feat, believed, to, have, been, previously, accomplished, only, by, shoeless, joe, jackson, the, yankees, won, 6, 0, taking, three, out, of, four, from, the, red, sox, ruth, hit, his, second, home, run, on, may, 2, and, by, the, end, of, the, month, had, set, a, major, league, record, for, home, runs, in, a, month, with, 11, and, promptly, broke, it, with, 13, in, june, fans, responded, with, record, attendance, figures, on, may, 16, ruth, and, the, yankees, drew, 38, 600, to, the, polo, grounds, a, record, for, the, ballpark, and, 15, 000, fans, were, turned, away, large, crowds, jammed, stadiums, to, see, ruth, play, when, the, yankees, were, on, the, road, the, home, runs, kept, on, coming, ruth, tied, his, own, record, of, 29, on, july, 15, and, broke, it, with, home, runs, in, both, games, of, a, doubleheader, four, days, later, by, the, end, of, july, he, had, 37, but, his, pace, slackened, somewhat, after, that, nevertheless, on, september, 4, he, both, tied, and, broke, the, organized, baseball, record, for, home, runs, in, a, season, snapping, perry, werden, s, 1895, mark, of, 44, in, the, minor, western, league, the, yankees, played, well, as, a, team, battling, for, the, league, lead, early, in, the, summer, but, slumped, in, august, in, the, al, pennant, battle, with, chicago, and, cleveland, the, pennant, and, the, world, series, were, won, by, cleveland, who, surged, ahead, after, the, black, sox, scandal, broke, on, september, 28, and, led, to, the, suspension, of, many, of, chicago, s, top, players, including, shoeless, joe, jackson, the, yankees, finished, third, but, drew, 1, 2, million, fans, to, the, polo, grounds, the, first, time, a, team, had, drawn, a, seven, figure, attendance, the, rest, of, the, league, sold, 600, 000, more, tickets, many, fans, there, to, see, ruth, who, led, the, league, with, 54, home, runs, 158, runs, and, 137, runs, batted, in, rbis, in, 1920, and, afterwards, ruth, was, aided, in, his, power, hitting, by, the, fact, that, a, j, reach, company, the, maker, of, baseballs, used, in, the, major, leagues, was, using, a, more, efficient, machine, to, wind, the, yarn, found, within, the, baseball, the, new, baseballs, went, into, play, in, 1920, and, ushered, the, start, of, the, live, ball, era, the, number, of, home, runs, across, the, major, leagues, increased, by, 184, over, the, previous, year, baseball, statistician, bill, james, pointed, out, that, while, ruth, was, likely, aided, by, the, change, in, the, baseball, there, were, other, factors, at, work, including, the, gradual, abolition, of, the, spitball, accelerated, after, the, death, of, ray, chapman, struck, by, a, pitched, ball, thrown, by, mays, in, august, 1920, and, the, more, frequent, use, of, new, baseballs, also, a, response, to, chapman, s, death, nevertheless, james, theorized, that, ruth, s, 1920, explosion, might, have, happened, in, 1919, had, a, full, season, of, 154, games, been, played, rather, than, 140, had, ruth, refrained, from, pitching, 133, innings, that, season, and, if, he, were, playing, at, any, other, home, field, but, fenway, park, where, he, hit, only, 9, of, 29, home, runs, yankees, business, manager, harry, sparrow, had, died, early, in, the, 1920, season, ruppert, and, huston, hired, barrow, to, replace, him, the, two, men, quickly, made, a, deal, with, frazee, for, new, york, to, acquire, some, of, the, players, who, would, be, mainstays, of, the, early, yankee, pennant, winning, teams, including, catcher, wally, schang, and, pitcher, waite, hoyt, the, 21, year, old, hoyt, became, close, to, ruth, the, outrageous, life, fascinated, hoyt, the, don, t, give, a, shit, freedom, of, it, the, nonstop, pell, mell, charge, into, excess, how, did, a, man, drink, so, much, and, never, get, drunk, the, puzzle, of, babe, ruth, never, was, dull, no, matter, how, many, times, hoyt, picked, up, the, pieces, and, stared, at, them, after, games, he, would, follow, the, crowd, to, the, babe, s, suite, no, matter, what, the, town, the, beer, would, be, iced, and, the, bottles, would, fill, the, bathtub, in, the, offseason, ruth, spent, some, time, in, havana, cuba, where, he, was, said, to, have, lost, 35, 000, equivalent, to, 600, 000, in, 2023, betting, on, horse, races, ruth, hit, home, runs, early, and, often, in, the, 1921, season, during, which, he, broke, roger, connor, s, mark, for, home, runs, in, a, career, 138, each, of, the, almost, 600, home, runs, ruth, hit, in, his, career, after, that, extended, his, own, record, after, a, slow, start, the, yankees, were, soon, locked, in, a, tight, pennant, race, with, cleveland, winners, of, the, 1920, world, series, on, september, 15, ruth, hit, his, 55th, home, run, breaking, his, year, old, single, season, record, in, late, september, the, yankees, visited, cleveland, and, won, three, out, of, four, games, giving, them, the, upper, hand, in, the, race, and, clinched, their, first, pennant, a, few, days, later, ruth, finished, the, regular, season, with, 59, home, runs, batting, 378, and, with, a, slugging, percentage, of, 846, ruth, s, 177, runs, scored, 119, extra, base, hits, and, 457, total, bases, set, modern, era, records, that, still, stand, as, of, 2024, the, yankees, had, high, expectations, when, they, met, the, new, york, giants, in, the, 1921, world, series, every, game, of, which, was, played, in, the, polo, grounds, the, yankees, won, the, first, two, games, with, ruth, in, the, lineup, however, ruth, badly, scraped, his, elbow, during, game, 2, when, he, slid, into, third, base, he, had, walked, and, stolen, both, second, and, third, bases, after, the, game, he, was, told, by, the, team, physician, not, to, play, the, rest, of, the, series, despite, this, advice, he, did, play, in, the, next, three, games, and, pinch, hit, in, game, eight, of, the, best, of, nine, series, but, the, yankees, lost, five, games, to, three, ruth, hit, 316, drove, in, five, runs, and, hit, his, first, world, series, home, run, after, the, series, ruth, and, teammates, bob, meusel, and, bill, piercy, participated, in, a, barnstorming, tour, in, the, northeast, a, rule, then, in, force, prohibited, world, series, participants, from, playing, in, exhibition, games, during, the, offseason, the, purpose, being, to, prevent, series, participants, from, replicating, the, series, and, undermining, its, value, baseball, commissioner, kenesaw, mountain, landis, suspended, the, trio, until, may, 20, 1922, and, fined, them, their, 1921, world, series, checks, in, august, 1922, the, rule, was, changed, to, allow, limited, barnstorming, for, world, series, participants, with, landis, s, permission, required, on, march, 4, 1922, ruth, signed, a, new, contract, for, three, years, at, 52, 000, a, year, equivalent, to, 950, 000, in, 2023, this, was, more, than, two, times, the, largest, sum, ever, paid, to, a, ballplayer, up, to, that, point, and, it, represented, 40, of, the, team, s, player, payroll, despite, his, suspension, ruth, was, named, the, yankees, new, on, field, captain, prior, to, the, 1922, season, during, the, suspension, he, worked, out, with, the, team, in, the, morning, and, played, exhibition, games, with, the, yankees, on, their, off, days, he, and, meusel, returned, on, may, 20, to, a, sellout, crowd, at, the, polo, grounds, but, ruth, batted, 0, for, 4, and, was, booed, on, may, 25, he, was, thrown, out, of, the, game, for, throwing, dust, in, umpire, george, hildebrand, s, face, then, climbed, into, the, stands, to, confront, a, heckler, ban, johnson, ordered, him, fined, suspended, and, stripped, of, position, as, team, captain, in, his, shortened, season, ruth, appeared, in, 110, games, batted, 315, with, 35, home, runs, and, drove, in, 99, runs, but, the, 1922, season, was, a, disappointment, in, comparison, to, his, two, previous, dominating, years, despite, ruth, s, off, year, the, yankees, managed, to, win, the, pennant, and, faced, the, new, york, giants, in, the, world, series, for, the, second, consecutive, year, in, the, series, giants, manager, john, mcgraw, instructed, his, pitchers, to, throw, him, nothing, but, curveballs, and, ruth, never, adjusted, ruth, had, just, two, hits, in, 17, at, bats, and, the, yankees, lost, to, the, giants, for, the, second, straight, year, by, 4, 0, with, one, tie, game, sportswriter, joe, vila, called, him, an, exploded, phenomenon, after, the, season, ruth, was, a, guest, at, an, elks, club, banquet, set, up, by, ruth, s, agent, with, yankee, team, support, there, each, speaker, concluding, with, future, new, york, mayor, jimmy, walker, censured, him, for, his, poor, behavior, an, emotional, ruth, promised, reform, and, to, the, surprise, of, many, followed, through, when, he, reported, to, spring, training, he, was, in, his, best, shape, as, a, yankee, weighing, only, 210, pounds, 95, kg, the, yankees, status, as, tenants, of, the, giants, at, the, polo, grounds, had, become, increasingly, uneasy, and, in, 1922, giants, owner, charles, stoneham, said, the, yankees, lease, expiring, after, that, season, would, not, be, renewed, ruppert, and, huston, had, long, contemplated, a, new, stadium, and, had, taken, an, option, on, property, at, 161st, street, and, river, avenue, in, the, bronx, yankee, stadium, was, completed, in, time, for, the, home, opener, on, april, 18, 1923, at, which, ruth, hit, the, first, home, run, in, what, was, quickly, dubbed, the, house, that, ruth, built, the, ballpark, was, designed, with, ruth, in, mind, although, the, venue, s, left, field, fence, was, further, from, home, plate, than, at, the, polo, grounds, yankee, stadium, s, right, field, fence, was, closer, making, home, runs, easier, to, hit, for, left, handed, batters, to, spare, ruth, s, eyes, right, field, his, defensive, position, was, not, pointed, into, the, afternoon, sun, as, was, traditional, left, fielder, meusel, soon, developed, headaches, from, squinting, toward, home, plate, during, the, 1923, season, the, yankees, were, never, seriously, challenged, and, won, the, al, pennant, by, 17, games, ruth, finished, the, season, with, a, career, high, 393, batting, average, and, 41, home, runs, which, tied, cy, williams, for, the, most, in, the, major, leagues, that, year, ruth, hit, a, career, high, 45, doubles, in, 1923, and, he, reached, base, 379, times, then, a, major, league, record, for, the, third, straight, year, the, yankees, faced, the, giants, in, the, world, series, which, ruth, dominated, he, batted, 368, walked, eight, times, scored, eight, runs, hit, three, home, runs, and, slugged, 1, 000, during, the, series, as, the, yankees, christened, their, new, stadium, with, their, first, world, series, championship, four, games, to, two, in, 1924, the, yankees, were, favored, to, become, the, first, team, to, win, four, consecutive, pennants, plagued, by, injuries, they, found, themselves, in, a, battle, with, the, senators, although, the, yankees, won, 18, of, 22, at, one, point, in, september, the, senators, beat, out, the, yankees, by, two, games, ruth, hit, 378, winning, his, only, al, batting, title, with, a, league, leading, 46, home, runs, ruth, did, not, look, like, an, athlete, he, was, described, as, toothpicks, attached, to, a, piano, with, a, big, upper, body, but, thin, wrists, and, legs, ruth, had, kept, up, his, efforts, to, stay, in, shape, in, 1923, and, 1924, but, by, early, 1925, weighed, nearly, 260, pounds, 120, kg, his, annual, visit, to, hot, springs, arkansas, where, he, exercised, and, took, saunas, early, in, the, year, did, him, no, good, as, he, spent, much, of, the, time, carousing, in, the, resort, town, he, became, ill, while, there, and, relapsed, during, spring, training, ruth, collapsed, in, asheville, north, carolina, as, the, team, journeyed, north, he, was, put, on, a, train, for, new, york, where, he, was, briefly, hospitalized, a, rumor, circulated, that, he, had, died, prompting, british, newspapers, to, print, a, premature, obituary, in, new, york, ruth, collapsed, again, and, was, found, unconscious, in, his, hotel, bathroom, he, was, taken, to, a, hospital, where, he, had, multiple, convulsions, after, sportswriter, w, o, mcgeehan, wrote, that, ruth, s, illness, was, due, to, binging, on, hot, dogs, and, soda, pop, before, a, game, it, became, known, as, the, bellyache, heard, round, the, world, however, the, exact, cause, of, his, ailment, has, never, been, confirmed, and, remains, a, mystery, glenn, stout, in, his, history, of, the, yankees, writes, that, the, ruth, legend, is, still, one, of, the, most, sheltered, in, sports, he, suggests, that, alcohol, was, at, the, root, of, ruth, s, illness, pointing, to, the, fact, that, ruth, remained, six, weeks, at, st, vincent, s, hospital, but, was, allowed, to, leave, under, supervision, for, workouts, with, the, team, for, part, of, that, time, he, concludes, that, the, hospitalization, was, behavior, related, playing, just, 98, games, ruth, had, his, worst, season, as, a, yankee, he, finished, with, a, 290, average, and, 25, home, runs, the, yankees, finished, next, to, last, in, the, al, with, a, 69, 85, record, their, last, season, with, a, losing, record, until, 1965, ruth, spent, part, of, the, offseason, of, 1925, 26, working, out, at, artie, mcgovern, s, gym, where, he, got, back, into, shape, barrow, and, huggins, had, rebuilt, the, team, and, surrounded, the, veteran, core, with, good, young, players, like, tony, lazzeri, and, lou, gehrig, but, the, yankees, were, not, expected, to, win, the, pennant, ruth, returned, to, his, normal, production, during, 1926, when, he, batted, 372, with, 47, home, runs, and, 146, rbis, the, yankees, built, a, 10, game, lead, by, mid, june, and, coasted, to, win, the, pennant, by, three, games, the, st, louis, cardinals, had, won, the, national, league, with, the, lowest, winning, percentage, for, a, pennant, winner, to, that, point, 578, and, the, yankees, were, expected, to, win, the, world, series, easily, although, the, yankees, won, the, opener, in, new, york, st, louis, took, games, two, and, three, in, game, four, ruth, hit, three, home, runs, the, first, time, this, had, been, done, in, a, world, series, game, to, lead, the, yankees, to, victory, in, the, fifth, game, ruth, caught, a, ball, as, he, crashed, into, the, fence, the, play, was, described, by, baseball, writers, as, a, defensive, gem, new, york, took, that, game, but, grover, cleveland, alexander, won, game, six, for, st, louis, to, tie, the, series, at, three, games, each, then, got, very, drunk, he, was, nevertheless, inserted, into, game, seven, in, the, seventh, inning, and, shut, down, the, yankees, to, win, the, game, 3, 2, and, win, the, series, ruth, had, hit, his, fourth, home, run, of, the, series, earlier, in, the, game, and, was, the, only, yankee, to, reach, base, off, alexander, he, walked, in, the, ninth, inning, before, being, thrown, out, to, end, the, game, when, he, attempted, to, steal, second, base, although, ruth, s, attempt, to, steal, second, is, often, deemed, a, baserunning, blunder, creamer, pointed, out, that, the, yankees, chances, of, tying, the, game, would, have, been, greatly, improved, with, a, runner, in, scoring, position, the, 1926, world, series, was, also, known, for, ruth, s, promise, to, johnny, sylvester, a, hospitalized, 11, year, old, boy, ruth, promised, the, child, that, he, would, hit, a, home, run, on, his, behalf, sylvester, had, been, injured, in, a, fall, from, a, horse, and, a, friend, of, sylvester, s, father, gave, the, boy, two, autographed, baseballs, signed, by, yankees, and, cardinals, the, friend, relayed, a, promise, from, ruth, who, did, not, know, the, boy, that, he, would, hit, a, home, run, for, him, after, the, series, ruth, visited, the, boy, in, the, hospital, when, the, matter, became, public, the, press, greatly, inflated, it, and, by, some, accounts, ruth, allegedly, saved, the, boy, s, life, by, visiting, him, emotionally, promising, to, hit, a, home, run, and, doing, so, ruth, s, 1926, salary, of, 52, 000, was, far, more, than, any, other, baseball, player, but, he, made, at, least, twice, as, much, in, other, income, including, 100, 000, from, 12, weeks, of, vaudeville, the, 1927, new, york, yankees, team, is, considered, one, of, the, greatest, squads, to, ever, take, the, field, known, as, murderers, row, because, of, the, power, of, its, lineup, the, team, clinched, first, place, on, labor, day, won, a, then, al, record, 110, games, and, took, the, al, pennant, by, 19, games, there, was, no, suspense, in, the, pennant, race, and, the, nation, turned, its, attention, to, ruth, s, pursuit, of, his, own, single, season, home, run, record, of, 59, round, trippers, ruth, was, not, alone, in, this, chase, teammate, lou, gehrig, proved, to, be, a, slugger, who, was, capable, of, challenging, ruth, for, his, home, run, crown, he, tied, ruth, with, 24, home, runs, late, in, june, through, july, and, august, the, dynamic, duo, was, never, separated, by, more, than, two, home, runs, gehrig, took, the, lead, 45, 44, in, the, first, game, of, a, doubleheader, at, fenway, park, early, in, september, ruth, responded, with, two, blasts, of, his, own, to, take, the, lead, as, it, proved, permanently, gehrig, finished, with, 47, even, so, as, of, september, 6, ruth, was, still, several, games, off, his, 1921, pace, and, going, into, the, final, series, against, the, senators, had, only, 57, he, hit, two, in, the, first, game, of, the, series, including, one, off, of, paul, hopkins, facing, his, first, major, league, batter, to, tie, the, record, the, following, day, september, 30, he, broke, it, with, his, 60th, homer, in, the, eighth, inning, off, tom, zachary, to, break, a, 2, 2, tie, sixty, let, s, see, some, son, of, a, bitch, try, to, top, that, one, ruth, exulted, after, the, game, in, addition, to, his, career, high, 60, home, runs, ruth, batted, 356, drove, in, 164, runs, and, slugged, 772, in, the, 1927, world, series, the, yankees, swept, the, pittsburgh, pirates, in, four, games, the, national, leaguers, were, disheartened, after, watching, the, yankees, take, batting, practice, before, game, one, with, ball, after, ball, leaving, forbes, field, according, to, appel, the, 1927, new, york, yankees, even, today, the, words, inspire, awe, all, baseball, success, is, measured, against, the, 27, team, the, following, season, started, off, well, for, the, yankees, who, led, the, league, in, the, early, going, but, the, yankees, were, plagued, by, injuries, erratic, pitching, and, inconsistent, play, the, philadelphia, athletics, rebuilding, after, some, lean, years, erased, the, yankees, big, lead, and, even, took, over, first, place, briefly, in, early, september, the, yankees, however, regained, first, place, when, they, beat, the, athletics, three, out, of, four, games, in, a, pivotal, series, at, yankee, stadium, later, that, month, and, clinched, the, pennant, in, the, final, weekend, of, the, season, ruth, s, play, in, 1928, mirrored, his, team, s, performance, he, got, off, to, a, hot, start, and, on, august, 1, he, had, 42, home, runs, this, put, him, ahead, of, his, 60, home, run, pace, from, the, previous, season, he, then, slumped, for, the, latter, part, of, the, season, and, he, hit, just, twelve, home, runs, in, the, last, two, months, ruth, s, batting, average, also, fell, to, 323, well, below, his, career, average, nevertheless, he, ended, the, season, with, 54, home, runs, the, yankees, swept, the, favored, cardinals, in, four, games, in, the, world, series, with, ruth, batting, 625, and, hitting, three, home, runs, in, game, four, including, one, off, alexander, before, the, 1929, season, ruppert, who, had, bought, out, huston, in, 1923, announced, that, the, yankees, would, wear, uniform, numbers, to, allow, fans, at, cavernous, yankee, stadium, to, easily, identify, the, players, the, cardinals, and, indians, had, each, experimented, with, uniform, numbers, the, yankees, were, the, first, to, use, them, on, both, home, and, away, uniforms, ruth, batted, third, and, was, given, number, 3, according, to, a, long, standing, baseball, legend, the, yankees, adopted, their, now, iconic, pinstriped, uniforms, in, hopes, of, making, ruth, look, slimmer, in, truth, though, they, had, been, wearing, pinstripes, since, 1915, although, the, yankees, started, well, the, athletics, soon, proved, they, were, the, better, team, in, 1929, splitting, two, series, with, the, yankees, in, the, first, month, of, the, season, then, taking, advantage, of, a, yankee, losing, streak, in, mid, may, to, gain, first, place, although, ruth, performed, well, the, yankees, were, not, able, to, catch, the, athletics, connie, mack, had, built, another, great, team, tragedy, struck, the, yankees, late, in, the, year, as, manager, huggins, died, at, 51, of, erysipelas, a, bacterial, skin, infection, on, september, 25, only, ten, days, after, he, had, last, directed, the, team, despite, their, past, differences, ruth, praised, huggins, and, described, him, as, a, great, guy, the, yankees, finished, second, 18, games, behind, the, athletics, ruth, hit, 345, during, the, season, with, 46, home, runs, and, 154, rbis, a, few, seasons, ago, i, used, a, 54, ounce, bat, long, and, with, the, weight, well, at, the, end, now, i, m, using, a, 46, ounce, club, and, each, season, when, i, have, a, new, set, of, bats, made, i, have, an, additional, ounce, taken, off, ruth, in, babe, ruth, s, own, book, of, baseball, 1928, p, 171, on, october, 17, the, yankees, hired, bob, shawkey, as, manager, he, was, their, fourth, choice, ruth, had, politicked, for, the, job, of, player, manager, but, ruppert, and, barrow, never, seriously, considered, him, for, the, position, stout, deemed, this, the, first, hint, ruth, would, have, no, future, with, the, yankees, once, he, retired, as, a, player, shawkey, a, former, yankees, player, and, teammate, of, ruth, would, prove, unable, to, command, ruth, s, respect, on, january, 7, 1930, salary, negotiations, between, the, yankees, and, ruth, quickly, broke, down, having, just, concluded, a, three, year, contract, at, an, annual, salary, of, 70, 000, ruth, promptly, rejected, both, the, yankees, initial, proposal, of, 70, 000, for, one, year, and, their, final, offer, of, two, years, at, seventy, five, the, latter, figure, equaling, the, annual, salary, of, then, us, president, herbert, hoover, instead, ruth, demanded, at, least, 85, 000, and, three, years, when, asked, why, he, thought, he, was, worth, more, than, the, president, of, the, united, states, ruth, responded, say, if, i, hadn, t, been, sick, last, summer, i, d, have, broken, hell, out, of, that, home, run, record, besides, the, president, gets, a, four, year, contract, i, m, only, asking, for, three, exactly, two, months, later, a, compromise, was, reached, with, ruth, settling, for, two, years, at, an, unprecedented, 80, 000, per, year, ruth, s, salary, was, more, than, 2, 4, times, greater, than, the, next, highest, salary, that, season, a, record, margin, as, of, 2019, in, 1930, ruth, hit, 359, with, 49, home, runs, his, best, in, his, years, after, 1928, and, 153, rbis, and, pitched, his, first, game, in, nine, years, a, complete, game, victory, nevertheless, the, athletics, won, their, second, consecutive, pennant, and, world, series, as, the, yankees, finished, in, third, place, sixteen, games, back, at, the, end, of, the, season, shawkey, was, fired, and, replaced, with, cubs, manager, joe, mccarthy, though, ruth, again, unsuccessfully, sought, the, job, mccarthy, was, a, disciplinarian, but, chose, not, to, interfere, with, ruth, who, did, not, seek, conflict, with, the, manager, the, team, improved, in, 1931, but, was, no, match, for, the, athletics, who, won, 107, games, 13, 1, 2, games, in, front, of, the, yankees, ruth, for, his, part, hit, 373, with, 46, home, runs, and, 163, rbis, he, had, 31, doubles, his, most, since, 1924, in, the, 1932, season, the, yankees, went, 107, 47, and, won, the, pennant, ruth, s, effectiveness, had, decreased, somewhat, but, he, still, hit, 341, with, 41, home, runs, and, 137, rbis, nevertheless, he, was, sidelined, twice, because, of, injuries, during, the, season, the, yankees, faced, the, cubs, mccarthy, s, former, team, in, the, 1932, world, series, there, was, bad, blood, between, the, two, teams, as, the, yankees, resented, the, cubs, only, awarding, half, a, world, series, share, to, mark, koenig, a, former, yankee, the, games, at, yankee, stadium, had, not, been, sellouts, both, were, won, by, the, home, team, with, ruth, collecting, two, singles, but, scoring, four, runs, as, he, was, walked, four, times, by, the, cubs, pitchers, in, chicago, ruth, was, resentful, at, the, hostile, crowds, that, met, the, yankees, train, and, jeered, them, at, the, hotel, the, crowd, for, game, three, included, new, york, governor, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, democratic, candidate, for, president, who, sat, with, chicago, mayor, anton, cermak, many, in, the, crowd, threw, lemons, at, ruth, a, sign, of, derision, and, others, as, well, as, the, cubs, themselves, shouted, abuse, at, ruth, and, other, yankees, they, were, briefly, silenced, when, ruth, hit, a, three, run, home, run, off, charlie, root, in, the, first, inning, but, soon, revived, and, the, cubs, tied, the, score, at, 4, 4, in, the, fourth, inning, partly, due, to, ruth, s, fielding, error, in, the, outfield, when, ruth, came, to, the, plate, in, the, top, of, the, fifth, the, chicago, crowd, and, players, led, by, pitcher, guy, bush, were, screaming, insults, at, ruth, with, the, count, at, two, balls, and, one, strike, ruth, gestured, possibly, in, the, direction, of, center, field, and, after, the, next, pitch, a, strike, may, have, pointed, there, with, one, hand, ruth, hit, the, fifth, pitch, over, the, center, field, fence, estimates, were, that, it, traveled, nearly, 500, feet, 150, m, whether, or, not, ruth, intended, to, indicate, where, he, planned, to, and, did, hit, the, ball, charlie, devens, who, in, 1999, was, interviewed, as, ruth, s, surviving, teammate, in, that, game, did, not, think, so, the, incident, has, gone, down, in, legend, as, babe, ruth, s, called, shot, the, yankees, won, game, three, and, the, following, day, clinched, the, series, with, another, victory, during, that, game, bush, hit, ruth, on, the, arm, with, a, pitch, causing, words, to, be, exchanged, and, provoking, a, game, winning, yankee, rally, ruth, remained, productive, in, 1933, he, batted, 301, with, 34, home, runs, 103, rbis, and, a, league, leading, 114, walks, as, the, yankees, finished, in, second, place, seven, games, behind, the, senators, athletics, manager, connie, mack, selected, him, to, play, right, field, in, the, first, major, league, baseball, all, star, game, held, on, july, 6, 1933, at, comiskey, park, in, chicago, he, hit, the, first, home, run, in, the, all, star, game, s, history, a, two, run, blast, against, bill, hallahan, during, the, third, inning, which, helped, the, al, win, the, game, 4, 2, during, the, final, game, of, the, 1933, season, as, a, publicity, stunt, organized, by, his, team, ruth, was, called, upon, and, pitched, a, complete, game, victory, against, the, red, sox, his, final, appearance, as, a, pitcher, despite, unremarkable, pitching, numbers, ruth, had, a, 5, 0, record, in, five, games, for, the, yankees, raising, his, career, totals, to, 94, 46, in, 1934, ruth, played, in, his, last, full, season, with, the, yankees, by, this, time, years, of, high, living, were, starting, to, catch, up, with, him, his, conditioning, had, deteriorated, to, the, point, that, he, could, no, longer, field, or, run, he, accepted, a, pay, cut, to, 35, 000, from, ruppert, but, he, was, still, the, highest, paid, player, in, the, major, leagues, he, could, still, handle, a, bat, recording, a, 288, batting, average, with, 22, home, runs, however, reisler, described, these, statistics, as, merely, mortal, by, ruth, s, previous, standards, ruth, was, selected, to, the, al, all, star, team, for, the, second, consecutive, year, even, though, he, was, in, the, twilight, of, his, career, during, the, game, new, york, giants, pitcher, carl, hubbell, struck, out, ruth, and, four, other, future, hall, of, famers, consecutively, the, yankees, finished, second, again, seven, games, behind, the, tigers, by, this, time, ruth, knew, he, was, nearly, finished, as, a, player, he, desired, to, remain, in, baseball, as, a, manager, he, was, often, spoken, of, as, a, possible, candidate, as, managerial, jobs, opened, up, but, in, 1932, when, he, was, mentioned, as, a, contender, for, the, red, sox, position, ruth, stated, that, he, was, not, yet, ready, to, leave, the, field, there, were, rumors, that, ruth, was, a, likely, candidate, each, time, when, the, cleveland, indians, cincinnati, reds, and, detroit, tigers, were, looking, for, a, manager, but, nothing, came, of, them, just, before, the, 1934, season, ruppert, offered, to, make, ruth, the, manager, of, the, yankees, top, minor, league, team, the, newark, bears, but, he, was, talked, out, of, it, by, his, wife, claire, and, his, business, manager, christy, walsh, tigers, owner, frank, navin, seriously, considered, acquiring, ruth, and, making, him, player, manager, however, ruth, insisted, on, delaying, the, meeting, until, he, came, back, from, a, trip, to, hawaii, navin, was, unwilling, to, wait, ruth, opted, to, go, on, his, trip, despite, barrow, advising, him, that, he, was, making, a, mistake, in, any, event, ruth, s, asking, price, was, too, high, for, the, notoriously, tight, fisted, navin, the, tigers, job, ultimately, went, to, mickey, cochrane, early, in, the, 1934, season, ruth, openly, campaigned, to, become, the, yankees, manager, however, the, yankee, job, was, never, a, serious, possibility, ruppert, always, supported, mccarthy, who, would, remain, in, his, position, for, another, 12, seasons, the, relationship, between, ruth, and, mccarthy, had, been, lukewarm, at, best, and, ruth, s, managerial, ambitions, further, chilled, their, interpersonal, relations, by, the, end, of, the, season, ruth, hinted, that, he, would, retire, unless, ruppert, named, him, manager, of, the, yankees, when, the, time, came, ruppert, wanted, ruth, to, leave, the, team, without, drama, or, hard, feelings, during, the, 1934, 35, offseason, ruth, circled, the, world, with, his, wife, the, trip, included, a, barnstorming, tour, of, the, far, east, at, his, final, stop, in, the, united, kingdom, before, returning, home, ruth, was, introduced, to, cricket, by, australian, player, alan, fairfax, and, after, having, little, luck, in, a, cricketer, s, stance, he, stood, as, a, baseball, batter, and, launched, some, massive, shots, around, the, field, destroying, the, bat, in, the, process, although, fairfax, regretted, that, he, could, not, have, the, time, to, make, ruth, a, cricket, player, ruth, had, lost, any, interest, in, such, a, career, upon, learning, that, the, best, batsmen, made, only, about, 40, per, week, also, during, the, offseason, ruppert, had, been, sounding, out, the, other, clubs, in, hopes, of, finding, one, that, would, be, willing, to, take, ruth, as, a, manager, and, or, a, player, however, the, only, serious, offer, came, from, athletics, owner, manager, connie, mack, who, gave, some, thought, to, stepping, down, as, manager, in, favor, of, ruth, however, mack, later, dropped, the, idea, saying, that, ruth, s, wife, would, be, running, the, team, in, a, month, if, ruth, ever, took, over, while, the, barnstorming, tour, was, underway, ruppert, began, negotiating, with, boston, braves, owner, judge, emil, fuchs, who, wanted, ruth, as, a, gate, attraction, the, braves, had, enjoyed, modest, recent, success, finishing, fourth, in, the, national, league, in, both, 1933, and, 1934, but, the, team, drew, poorly, at, the, box, office, unable, to, afford, the, rent, at, braves, field, fuchs, had, considered, holding, dog, races, there, when, the, braves, were, not, at, home, only, to, be, turned, down, by, landis, after, a, series, of, phone, calls, letters, and, meetings, the, yankees, traded, ruth, to, the, braves, on, february, 26, 1935, ruppert, had, stated, that, he, would, not, release, ruth, to, go, to, another, team, as, a, full, time, player, for, this, reason, it, was, announced, that, ruth, would, become, a, team, vice, president, and, would, be, consulted, on, all, club, transactions, in, addition, to, playing, he, was, also, made, assistant, manager, to, braves, skipper, bill, mckechnie, in, a, long, letter, to, ruth, a, few, days, before, the, press, conference, fuchs, promised, ruth, a, share, in, the, braves, profits, with, the, possibility, of, becoming, co, owner, of, the, team, fuchs, also, raised, the, possibility, of, ruth, succeeding, mckechnie, as, manager, perhaps, as, early, as, 1936, ruppert, called, the, deal, the, greatest, opportunity, ruth, ever, had, there, was, considerable, attention, as, ruth, reported, for, spring, training, he, did, not, hit, his, first, home, run, of, the, spring, until, after, the, team, had, left, florida, and, was, beginning, the, road, north, in, savannah, he, hit, two, in, an, exhibition, game, against, the, bears, amid, much, press, attention, ruth, played, his, first, home, game, in, boston, in, over, 16, years, before, an, opening, day, crowd, of, over, 25, 000, including, five, of, new, england, s, six, state, governors, ruth, accounted, for, all, the, braves, runs, in, a, 4, 2, win, over, the, new, york, giants, hitting, a, two, run, home, run, singling, to, drive, in, a, third, run, and, later, in, the, inning, scoring, the, fourth, although, age, and, weight, had, slowed, him, he, made, a, running, catch, in, left, field, that, sportswriters, deemed, the, defensive, highlight, of, the, game, ruth, had, two, hits, in, the, second, game, of, the, season, but, it, quickly, went, downhill, both, for, him, and, the, braves, from, there, the, season, soon, settled, down, to, a, routine, of, ruth, performing, poorly, on, the, few, occasions, he, even, played, at, all, as, april, passed, into, may, ruth, s, physical, deterioration, became, even, more, pronounced, while, he, remained, productive, at, the, plate, early, on, he, could, do, little, else, his, conditioning, had, become, so, poor, that, he, could, barely, trot, around, the, bases, he, made, so, many, errors, that, three, braves, pitchers, told, mckechnie, they, would, not, take, the, mound, if, he, was, in, the, lineup, before, long, ruth, stopped, hitting, as, well, he, grew, increasingly, annoyed, that, mckechnie, ignored, most, of, his, advice, mckechnie, later, said, that, ruth, s, presence, made, enforcing, discipline, nearly, impossible, ruth, soon, realized, that, fuchs, had, deceived, him, and, had, no, intention, of, making, him, manager, or, giving, him, any, significant, off, field, duties, he, later, said, his, only, duties, as, vice, president, consisted, of, making, public, appearances, and, autographing, tickets, ruth, also, found, out, that, far, from, giving, him, a, share, of, the, profits, fuchs, wanted, him, to, invest, some, of, his, money, in, the, team, in, a, last, ditch, effort, to, improve, its, balance, sheet, as, it, turned, out, fuchs, and, ruppert, had, both, known, all, along, that, ruth, s, non, playing, positions, were, meaningless, by, the, end, of, the, first, month, of, the, season, ruth, concluded, he, was, finished, even, as, a, part, time, player, as, early, as, may, 12, he, asked, fuchs, to, let, him, retire, ultimately, fuchs, persuaded, ruth, to, remain, at, least, until, after, the, memorial, day, doubleheader, in, philadelphia, in, the, interim, was, a, western, road, trip, at, which, the, rival, teams, had, scheduled, days, to, honor, him, in, chicago, and, st, louis, ruth, performed, poorly, and, his, batting, average, sank, to, 155, with, only, two, additional, home, runs, for, a, total, of, three, on, the, season, so, far, in, the, first, two, games, in, pittsburgh, ruth, had, only, one, hit, though, a, long, fly, caught, by, paul, waner, probably, would, have, been, a, home, run, in, any, other, ballpark, besides, forbes, field, ruth, played, in, the, third, game, of, the, pittsburgh, series, on, may, 25, 1935, and, added, one, more, tale, to, his, playing, legend, ruth, went, 4, for, 4, including, three, home, runs, though, the, braves, lost, the, game, 11, 7, the, last, two, were, off, ruth, s, old, cubs, nemesis, guy, bush, the, final, home, run, both, of, the, game, and, of, ruth, s, career, sailed, out, of, the, park, over, the, right, field, upper, deck, the, first, time, anyone, had, hit, a, fair, ball, completely, out, of, forbes, field, ruth, was, urged, to, make, this, his, last, game, but, he, had, given, his, word, to, fuchs, and, played, in, cincinnati, and, philadelphia, the, first, game, of, the, doubleheader, in, philadelphia, the, braves, lost, both, was, his, final, major, league, appearance, ruth, retired, on, june, 2, after, an, argument, with, fuchs, he, finished, 1935, with, a, 181, average, easily, his, worst, as, a, full, time, position, player, and, the, final, six, of, his, 714, home, runs, the, braves, 10, 27, when, ruth, left, finished, 38, 115, at, 248, the, worst, winning, percentage, in, modern, national, league, history, insolvent, like, his, team, fuchs, gave, up, control, of, the, braves, before, the, end, of, the, season, the, national, league, took, over, the, franchise, at, the, end, of, the, year, although, fuchs, had, given, ruth, his, unconditional, release, no, major, league, team, expressed, an, interest, in, hiring, him, in, any, capacity, ruth, still, hoped, to, be, hired, as, a, manager, if, he, could, not, play, anymore, but, only, one, managerial, position, cleveland, became, available, between, ruth, s, retirement, and, the, end, of, the, 1937, season, asked, if, he, had, considered, ruth, for, the, job, indians, owner, alva, bradley, replied, negatively, of, the, five, members, in, the, inaugural, class, of, baseball, hall, of, fame, in, 1936, ty, cobb, honus, wagner, christy, mathewson, walter, johnson, and, ruth, only, ruth, was, not, given, an, offer, to, manage, a, baseball, team, team, owners, and, general, managers, assessed, ruth, s, flamboyant, personal, habits, as, a, reason, to, exclude, him, from, a, managerial, job, barrow, said, of, him, how, can, he, manage, other, men, when, he, can, t, even, manage, himself, creamer, believed, ruth, was, unfairly, treated, in, never, being, given, an, opportunity, to, manage, a, major, league, club, the, author, believed, there, was, not, necessarily, a, relationship, between, personal, conduct, and, managerial, success, noting, that, john, mcgraw, billy, martin, and, bobby, valentine, were, winners, despite, character, flaws, ruth, played, much, golf, and, in, a, few, exhibition, baseball, games, where, he, demonstrated, a, continuing, ability, to, draw, large, crowds, this, appeal, contributed, to, the, dodgers, hiring, him, as, first, base, coach, in, 1938, when, ruth, was, hired, brooklyn, general, manager, larry, macphail, made, it, clear, that, ruth, would, not, be, considered, for, the, manager, s, job, if, as, expected, burleigh, grimes, retired, at, the, end, of, the, season, although, much, was, said, about, what, ruth, could, teach, the, younger, players, in, practice, his, duties, were, to, appear, on, the, field, in, uniform, and, encourage, base, runners, he, was, not, called, upon, to, relay, signs, in, august, shortly, before, the, baseball, rosters, expanded, ruth, sought, an, opportunity, to, return, as, an, active, player, in, a, pinch, hitting, role, ruth, often, took, batting, practice, before, games, and, felt, that, he, could, take, on, the, limited, role, grimes, denied, his, request, citing, ruth, s, poor, vision, in, his, right, eye, his, inability, to, run, the, bases, and, the, risk, of, an, injury, to, ruth, ruth, got, along, well, with, everyone, except, team, captain, leo, durocher, who, was, hired, as, grimes, replacement, at, season, s, end, ruth, then, left, his, job, as, a, first, base, coach, and, would, never, again, work, in, any, capacity, in, the, game, of, baseball, on, july, 4, 1939, ruth, spoke, on, lou, gehrig, appreciation, day, at, yankee, stadium, as, members, of, the, 1927, yankees, and, a, sellout, crowd, turned, out, to, honor, the, first, baseman, who, was, forced, into, premature, retirement, by, als, which, would, kill, him, two, years, later, the, next, week, ruth, went, to, cooperstown, new, york, for, the, formal, opening, of, the, baseball, hall, of, fame, three, years, earlier, he, was, one, of, the, first, five, players, elected, to, the, hall, as, radio, broadcasts, of, baseball, games, became, popular, ruth, sought, a, job, in, that, field, arguing, that, his, celebrity, and, knowledge, of, baseball, would, assure, large, audiences, but, he, received, no, offers, during, world, war, ii, he, made, many, personal, appearances, to, advance, the, war, effort, including, his, last, appearance, as, a, player, at, yankee, stadium, in, a, 1943, exhibition, for, the, army, navy, relief, fund, he, hit, a, long, fly, ball, off, walter, johnson, the, blast, left, the, field, curving, foul, but, ruth, circled, the, bases, anyway, in, 1946, he, made, a, final, effort, to, gain, a, job, in, baseball, when, he, contacted, new, yankees, boss, macphail, but, he, was, sent, a, rejection, letter, in, 1999, ruth, s, granddaughter, linda, tosetti, and, his, daughter, julia, ruth, stevens, said, that, babe, s, inability, to, land, a, managerial, role, with, the, yankees, caused, him, to, feel, hurt, and, slump, into, a, severe, depression, ruth, started, playing, golf, when, he, was, 20, and, continued, playing, the, game, throughout, his, life, his, appearance, at, many, new, york, courses, drew, spectators, and, headlines, rye, golf, club, was, among, the, courses, he, played, with, teammate, lyn, lary, in, june, 1933, with, birdies, on, 3, holes, ruth, posted, the, best, score, in, retirement, he, became, one, of, the, first, celebrity, golfers, participating, in, charity, tournaments, including, one, where, he, was, pitted, against, ty, cobb, ruth, met, helen, woodford, by, some, accounts, in, a, coffee, shop, in, boston, where, she, was, a, waitress, they, married, as, teenagers, on, october, 17, 1914, although, ruth, later, claimed, to, have, been, married, in, elkton, maryland, records, show, that, they, were, married, at, st, paul, s, catholic, church, in, ellicott, city, they, adopted, a, daughter, dorothy, in, 1921, ruth, and, helen, separated, around, 1925, reportedly, because, of, ruth, s, repeated, infidelities, and, neglect, they, appeared, in, public, as, a, couple, for, the, last, time, during, the, 1926, world, series, helen, died, in, january, 1929, at, age, 31, in, a, fire, in, a, house, in, watertown, massachusetts, owned, by, edward, kinder, a, dentist, with, whom, she, had, been, living, as, mrs, kinder, in, her, book, my, dad, the, babe, dorothy, claimed, that, she, was, ruth, s, biological, child, by, a, mistress, named, juanita, jennings, in, 1980, juanita, who, was, at, the, time, very, ill, admitted, this, to, dorothy, and, dorothy, s, sister, julia, on, april, 17, 1929, three, months, after, the, death, of, his, first, wife, ruth, married, actress, and, model, claire, merritt, hodgson, and, adopted, her, daughter, julia, it, was, the, second, and, final, marriage, for, both, parties, claire, unlike, helen, was, well, travelled, and, educated, and, put, structure, into, ruth, s, life, like, miller, huggins, did, for, him, on, the, field, by, one, account, julia, and, dorothy, were, through, no, fault, of, their, own, the, reason, for, the, seven, year, rift, in, ruth, s, relationship, with, teammate, lou, gehrig, sometime, in, 1932, during, a, conversation, that, she, assumed, was, private, gehrig, s, mother, remarked, it, s, a, shame, doesn, t, dress, dorothy, as, nicely, as, she, dresses, her, own, daughter, when, the, comment, got, back, to, ruth, he, angrily, told, gehrig, to, tell, his, mother, to, mind, her, own, business, gehrig, in, turn, took, offense, at, what, he, perceived, as, ruth, s, comment, about, his, mother, the, two, men, reportedly, never, spoke, off, the, field, until, they, reconciled, at, yankee, stadium, on, lou, gehrig, appreciation, day, july, 4, 1939, shortly, after, gehrig, s, retirement, from, baseball, although, ruth, was, married, throughout, most, of, his, baseball, career, when, team, co, owner, tillinghast, cap, huston, asked, him, to, tone, down, his, lifestyle, ruth, replied, i, ll, promise, to, go, easier, on, drinking, and, to, get, to, bed, earlier, but, not, for, you, fifty, thousand, dollars, or, two, hundred, and, fifty, thousand, dollars, will, i, give, up, women, they, re, too, much, fun, a, detective, that, the, yankees, hired, to, follow, him, one, night, in, chicago, reported, that, ruth, had, been, with, six, women, ping, bodie, said, that, he, was, not, ruth, s, roommate, while, traveling, i, room, with, his, suitcase, before, the, start, of, the, 1922, season, ruth, had, signed, a, three, year, contract, at, 52, 000, per, year, with, an, option, to, renew, for, two, additional, years, his, performance, during, the, 1922, season, had, been, disappointing, attributed, in, part, to, his, drinking, and, late, night, hours, after, the, end, of, the, 1922, season, he, was, asked, to, sign, a, contract, addendum, with, a, morals, clause, ruth, and, ruppert, signed, it, on, november, 11, 1922, it, called, for, ruth, to, abstain, entirely, from, the, use, of, intoxicating, liquors, and, to, not, stay, up, later, than, 1, 00, a, m, during, the, training, and, playing, season, without, permission, of, the, manager, ruth, was, also, enjoined, from, any, action, or, misbehavior, that, would, compromise, his, ability, to, play, baseball, as, early, as, the, war, years, doctors, had, cautioned, ruth, to, take, better, care, of, his, health, and, he, grudgingly, followed, their, advice, limiting, his, drinking, and, not, going, on, a, proposed, trip, to, support, the, troops, in, the, south, pacific, in, 1946, ruth, began, experiencing, severe, pain, over, his, left, eye, and, had, difficulty, swallowing, in, november, 1946, ruth, entered, french, hospital, in, new, york, for, tests, which, revealed, that, he, had, an, inoperable, malignant, tumor, at, the, base, of, his, skull, and, in, his, neck, the, malady, was, a, lesion, known, as, nasopharyngeal, carcinoma, or, lymphoepithelioma, a, physician, who, reviewed, ruth, s, autopsy, in, 1998, concluded, that, ruth, s, lifelong, use, of, tobacco, probably, played, a, part, in, his, cancer, his, name, and, fame, gave, him, access, to, experimental, treatments, and, he, was, one, of, the, first, cancer, patients, to, receive, both, drugs, and, radiation, treatment, simultaneously, having, lost, 80, pounds, 36, kg, he, was, discharged, from, the, hospital, in, february, and, went, to, florida, to, recuperate, he, returned, to, new, york, and, yankee, stadium, after, the, season, started, the, new, commissioner, happy, chandler, judge, landis, had, died, in, 1944, proclaimed, april, 27, 1947, babe, ruth, day, around, the, major, leagues, with, the, most, significant, observance, to, be, at, yankee, stadium, a, number, of, teammates, and, others, spoke, in, honor, of, ruth, who, briefly, addressed, the, crowd, of, almost, 60, 000, by, then, his, voice, was, a, soft, whisper, with, a, very, low, raspy, tone, around, this, time, developments, in, chemotherapy, offered, some, hope, for, ruth, the, doctors, had, not, told, ruth, he, had, cancer, because, of, his, family, s, fear, that, he, might, do, himself, harm, they, treated, him, with, pterolyl, triglutamate, teropterin, a, folic, acid, derivative, he, may, have, been, the, first, human, subject, ruth, showed, dramatic, improvement, during, the, summer, of, 1947, so, much, so, that, his, case, was, presented, by, his, doctors, at, a, scientific, meeting, without, using, his, name, he, was, able, to, travel, around, the, country, doing, promotional, work, for, the, ford, motor, company, on, american, legion, baseball, he, appeared, again, at, another, day, in, his, honor, at, yankee, stadium, in, september, but, was, not, well, enough, to, pitch, in, an, old, timers, game, as, he, had, hoped, the, improvement, was, only, a, temporary, remission, and, by, late, 1947, ruth, was, unable, to, help, with, the, writing, of, his, autobiography, the, babe, ruth, story, which, was, almost, entirely, ghostwritten, in, and, out, of, the, hospital, in, manhattan, he, left, for, florida, in, february, 1948, doing, what, activities, he, could, after, six, weeks, he, returned, to, new, york, to, appear, at, a, book, signing, party, he, also, traveled, to, california, to, witness, the, filming, of, the, movie, based, on, the, book, on, june, 5, 1948, a, gaunt, and, hollowed, out, ruth, visited, yale, university, to, donate, a, manuscript, of, the, babe, ruth, story, to, its, library, at, yale, he, met, with, future, president, george, h, w, bush, who, was, the, captain, of, the, yale, baseball, team, on, june, 13, ruth, visited, yankee, stadium, for, the, final, time, in, his, life, appearing, at, the, 25th, anniversary, celebrations, of, the, house, that, ruth, built, by, this, time, he, had, lost, much, weight, and, had, difficulty, walking, introduced, along, with, his, surviving, teammates, from, 1923, ruth, used, a, bat, as, a, cane, nat, fein, s, photo, of, ruth, taken, from, behind, standing, near, home, plate, and, facing, ruthville, right, field, became, one, of, baseball, s, most, famous, and, widely, circulated, photographs, and, won, the, pulitzer, prize, ruth, made, one, final, trip, on, behalf, of, american, legion, baseball, he, then, entered, memorial, hospital, where, he, would, die, he, was, never, told, he, had, cancer, however, before, his, death, he, surmised, it, he, was, able, to, leave, the, hospital, for, a, few, short, trips, including, a, final, visit, to, baltimore, on, july, 26, 1948, ruth, left, the, hospital, to, attend, the, premiere, of, the, film, the, babe, ruth, story, shortly, thereafter, he, returned, to, the, hospital, for, the, final, time, he, was, barely, able, to, speak, ruth, s, condition, gradually, grew, worse, and, only, a, few, visitors, were, permitted, to, see, him, one, of, whom, was, national, league, president, and, future, commissioner, of, baseball, ford, c, frick, ruth, was, so, thin,

subsequently, moved, to, the, new, venue, behind, the, center, field, fence, ruth, s, uniform, number, 3, has, been, retired, by, the, yankees, and, he, is, one, of, five, yankees, players, or,

pitching, in, the, schoolyard, ruth, s, widow, claire, his, two, daughters, dorothy, and, julia, and, his, sister, mamie, helped, select, and, install, exhibits, for, the, museum, ruth, was, the, first, baseball, star, to, be, the, subject, of, overwhelming, public, adulation, baseball, had, been, known, for, star, players, such, as, ty, cobb, and, shoeless, joe, jackson, but, both, men, had, uneasy, relations, with, fans, in, cobb, s, case, the, incidents, were, sometimes, marked, by, violence, ruth, s, biographers, agreed, that, he, benefited, from, the, timing, of, his, ascension, to, home, run, king, the, country, had, been, hit, hard, by, both, the, war, and, the, 1918, flu, pandemic, and, longed, for, something, to, help, put, these, traumas, behind, it, ruth, also, resonated, in, a, country, which, felt, in, the, aftermath, of, the, war, that, it, took, second, place, to, no, one, montville, argued, that, ruth, was, a, larger, than, life, figure, who, was, capable, of, unprecedented, athletic, feats, in, the, nation, s, largest, city, ruth, became, an, icon, of, the, social, changes, that, marked, the, early, 1920s, in, his, history, of, the, yankees, glenn, stout, writes, that, ruth, was, new, york, incarnate, uncouth, and, raw, flamboyant, and, flashy, oversized, out, of, scale, and, absolutely, unstoppable, during, his, lifetime, ruth, became, a, symbol, of, the, united, states, during, world, war, ii, japanese, soldiers, yelled, in, english, to, hell, with, babe, ruth, to, anger, american, soldiers, ruth, replied, that, he, hoped, every, jap, that, mention, my, name, gets, shot, creamer, recorded, that, babe, ruth, transcended, sport, and, moved, far, beyond, the, artificial, limits, of, baselines, and, outfield, fences, and, sports, pages, wagenheim, stated, he, appealed, to, a, deeply, rooted, american, yearning, for, the, definitive, climax, clean, quick, unarguable, according, to, glenn, stout, ruth, s, home, runs, were, exalted, uplifting, experience, that, meant, more, to, fans, than, any, runs, they, were, responsible, for, a, babe, ruth, home, run, was, an, event, unto, itself, one, that, meant, anything, was, possible, although, ruth, was, not, just, a, power, hitter, he, was, the, yankees, best, bunter, and, an, excellent, outfielder, ruth, s, penchant, for, hitting, home, runs, altered, how, baseball, is, played, prior, to, 1920, home, runs, were, unusual, and, managers, tried, to, win, games, by, getting, a, runner, on, base, and, bringing, him, around, to, score, through, such, means, as, the, stolen, base, the, bunt, and, the, hit, and, run, advocates, of, what, was, dubbed, inside, baseball, such, as, giants, manager, mcgraw, disliked, the, home, run, considering, it, a, blot, on, the, purity, of, the, game, according, to, sportswriter, w, a, phelon, after, the, 1920, season, ruth, s, breakout, performance, that, season, and, the, response, in, excitement, and, attendance, settled, for, all, time, to, come, that, the, american, public, is, nuttier, over, the, home, run, than, the, clever, fielding, or, the, hitless, pitching, viva, el, home, run, and, two, times, viva, babe, ruth, exponent, of, the, home, run, and, overshadowing, star, bill, james, states, when, the, owners, discovered, that, the, fans, liked, to, see, home, runs, and, when, the, foundations, of, the, games, were, simultaneously, imperiled, by, disgrace, then, there, was, no, turning, back, while, a, few, such, as, mcgraw, and, cobb, decried, the, passing, of, the, old, style, play, teams, quickly, began, to, seek, and, develop, sluggers, according, to, sportswriter, grantland, rice, only, two, sports, figures, of, the, 1920s, approached, ruth, in, popularity, boxer, jack, dempsey, and, racehorse, man, o, war, one, of, the, factors, that, contributed, to, ruth, s, broad, appeal, was, the, uncertainty, about, his, family, and, early, life, ruth, appeared, to, exemplify, the, american, success, story, that, even, an, uneducated, unsophisticated, youth, without, any, family, wealth, or, connections, can, do, something, better, than, anyone, else, in, the, world, montville, writes, that, the, fog, will, make, him, forever, accessible, universal, he, will, be, the, patron, saint, of, american, possibility, similarly, the, fact, that, ruth, played, in, the, pre, television, era, when, a, relatively, small, portion, of, his, fans, had, the, opportunity, to, see, him, play, allowed, his, legend, to, grow, through, word, of, mouth, and, the, hyperbole, of, sports, reporters, reisler, states, that, recent, sluggers, who, surpassed, ruth, s, 60, home, run, mark, such, as, mark, mcgwire, and, barry, bonds, generated, much, less, excitement, than, when, ruth, repeatedly, broke, the, single, season, home, run, record, in, the, 1920s, ruth, dominated, a, relatively, small, sports, world, while, americans, of, the, present, era, have, many, sports, available, to, watch, creamer, describes, ruth, as, a, unique, figure, in, the, social, history, of, the, united, states, thomas, barthel, describes, him, as, one, of, the, first, celebrity, athletes, numerous, biographies, have, portrayed, him, as, larger, than, life, a, dominant, figure, in, a, field, whether, within, or, outside, sports, is, often, referred, to, as, the, babe, ruth, of, that, field, similarly, ruthian, has, come, to, mean, in, sports, colossal, dramatic, prodigious, magnificent, with, great, power, he, was, the, first, athlete, to, make, more, money, from, endorsements, and, other, off, the, field, activities, than, from, his, sport, in, 2006, montville, stated, that, more, books, have, been, written, about, ruth, than, any, other, member, of, the, baseball, hall, of, fame, at, least, five, of, these, books, including, creamer, s, and, wagenheim, s, were, written, in, 1973, and, 1974, to, capitalize, on, the, increase, in, public, interest, in, ruth, as, hank, aaron, approached, his, career, home, run, mark, which, he, broke, on, april, 8, 1974, montville, suggested, that, ruth, is, probably, even, more, popular, today, than, he, was, then, the, long, ball, era, that, ruth, started, continues, in, baseball, owners, build, ballparks, to, encourage, home, runs, in, various, surveys, and, rankings, ruth, has, been, named, the, greatest, baseball, player, of, all, time, in, 1998,
