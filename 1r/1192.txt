papabile, possible, successors, desiderius, the, abbot, of, monte, cassino, was, chosen, to, follow, gregory, in, 1085, but, after, his, short, reign, as, victor, iii, odo, was, elected, by, acclamation, at, a, small, meeting, of, cardinals, and, other, prelates, held, in, terracina, in, march, 1088, from, the, outset, urban, had, to, reckon, with, the, presence, of, guibert, the, former, bishop, of, ravenna, who, held, rome, as, the, antipope, clement, iii, gregory, had, repeatedly, clashed, with, the, emperor, henry, iv, over, papal, authority, despite, the, walk, to, canossa,

policies, of, pope, gregory, vii, and, while, pursuing, them, with, determination, showed, greater, flexibility, and, diplomatic, finesse, usually, kept, away, from, rome, urban, toured, northern, italy, and, france, a, series, of, well, attended, synods, held, in, rome, amalfi, benevento, and, troia, supported, him, in, renewed, declarations, against, simony, lay, investitures, clerical,

solution, to, the, cleric, s, impasse, with, king, william, ii, of, england, and, finally, receiving, england, s, support, against, the, imperial, pope, in, rome, urban, maintained, vigorous, support, for, his, predecessors, reforms, however, and, did, not, shy, from, supporting, anselm, when, the, new, archbishop, of, canterbury, fled, england, likewise, despite, the, importance, of, french, support, for, his, cause, he, upheld, his, legate, hugh, of, die, s, excommunication, of, king, philip, over, his, doubly, bigamous, marriage, with, bertrade, de, montfort, wife, of, the, count, of, anjou, the, ban, was, repeatedly, lifted, and, reimposed, as, the, king, promised, to, forswear, her, and, then, repeatedly, returned, to, her, a, public, penance, in, 1104, ended, the, controversy, although, bertrade, remained, active, in, attempting, to, see, her, sons, succeed, philip, instead, of, louis, urban, further, authorised, itinerant, preachers, such, as, robert, of, arbrissel, to, spread, the, knowledge, of, christian, faith, and, promote, the, ideas, of, the, reform, movement, contributing, to, the, mass, phenomenon, of, spirituality, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, urban, ii, s, movement, took, its, first, public, shape, at, the, council, of, piacenza, where, in, march, 1095, urban, ii, received, an, ambassador, from, the, byzantine, emperor, alexios, i, komnenos, asking, for, help, against, the, turkish, tribes, who, had, taken, over, most, of, formerly, byzantine, anatolia, the, council, of, clermont, met, attended, by, numerous, italian, burgundian, and, french, bishops, all, of, the, sessions, except, the, final, one, took, place, either, in, the, cathedral, of, clermont, or, in, the, suburban, church, of, notre, dame, du, port, though, the, council, was, primarily, focused, on, reforms, within, the, church, hierarchy, urban, ii, gave, a, speech, on, 27, november, 1095, at, the, conclusion, of, the, council, to, a, broader, audience, the, speech, was, made, outside, in, the, open, air, to, accommodate, the, vast, crowd, that, had, come, to, hear, him, urban, ii, s, sermon, proved, highly, effective, as, he, summoned, the, attending, nobility, and, the, people, to, wrest, the, holy, land, and, the, eastern, churches, generally, from, the, domination, of, the, seljuks, this, was, the, speech, that, triggered, the, crusades, there, exists, no, exact, transcription, of, the, speech, that, urban, delivered, at, the, council, of, clermont, the, five, extant, versions, of, the, speech, were, written, down, some, time, later, and, they, differ, widely, from, one, another, all, versions, of, the, speech, except, that, by, fulcher, of, chartres, were, probably, influenced, by, the, chronicle, account, of, the, first, crusade, called, the, gesta, francorum, written, c, 1101, which, includes, a, version, of, it, fulcher, of, chartres, was, present, at, the, council, though, he, did, not, start, writing, his, history, of, the, crusade, including, a, version, of, the, speech, until, c, 1101, robert, the, monk, may, have, been, present, but, his, version, dates, from, about, 1106, as, a, better, means, of, evaluating, urban, s, true, motives, in, calling, for, a, crusade, to, the, holy, lands, there, are, four, extant, letters, written, by, pope, urban, himself, one, to, the, flemish, dated, december, 1095, one, to, the, bolognese, dated, september, 1096, one, to, vallombrosa, dated, october, 1096, and, one, to, the, counts, of, catalonia, dated, either, 1089, or, 1096, 1099, however, whereas, the, three, former, letters, were, concerned, with, rallying, popular, support, for, the, crusades, and, establishing, the, objectives, his, letters, to, the, catalonian, lords, instead, beseech, them, to, continue, the, fight, against, the, moors, assuring, them, that, doing, so, would, offer, the, same, divine, rewards, as, a, conflict, against, the, seljuks, it, is, urban, ii, s, own, letters, rather, than, the, paraphrased, versions, of, his, speech, at, clermont, that, reveal, his, actual, thinking, about, crusading, nevertheless, the, versions, of, the, speech, have, had, a, great, influence, on, popular, conceptions, and, misconceptions, about, the, crusades, so, it, is, worth, comparing, the, five, composed, speeches, to, urban, s, actual, words, fulcher, of, chartres, has, urban, saying, that, the, lord, and, christ, beseech, and, command, the, christians, to, fight, and, reclaim, their, land, the, chronicler, robert, the, monk, put, this, into, the, mouth, of, urban, ii, this, land, which, you, inhabit, shut, in, on, all, sides, by, the, seas, and, surrounded, by, the, mountain, peaks, is, too, narrow, for, your, large, population, nor, does, it, abound, in, wealth, and, it, furnishes, scarcely, food, enough, for, its, cultivators, hence, it, is, that, you, murder, one, another, that, you, wage, war, and, that, frequently, you, perish, by, mutual, wounds, let, therefore, hatred, depart, from, among, you, let, your, quarrels, end, let, wars, cease, and, let, all, dissensions, and, controversies, slumber, enter, upon, the, road, to, the, holy, sepulchre, wrest, that, land, from, the, wicked, race, and, subject, it, to, yourselves, god, has, conferred, upon, you, above, all, nations, great, glory, in, arms, accordingly, undertake, this, journey, for, the, remission, of, your, sins, with, the, assurance, of, the, imperishable, glory, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, robert, continued, when, pope, urban, had, said, these, things, in, his, urbane, discourse, he, so, influenced, to, one, purpose, the, desires, of, all, who, were, present, that, they, cried, out, it, is, the, will, of, god, it, is, the, will, of, god, when, the, venerable, roman, pontiff, heard, that, said, most, beloved, brethren, today, is, manifest, in, you, what, the, lord, says, in, the, gospel, where, two, or, three, are, gathered, together, in, my, name, there, am, i, in, the, midst, of, them, unless, the, lord, god, had, been, present, in, your, spirits, all, of, you, would, not, have, uttered, the, same, cry, for, although, the, cry, issued, from, numerous, mouths, yet, the, origin, of, the, cry, was, one, therefore, i, say, to, you, that, god, who, implanted, this, in, your, breasts, has, drawn, it, forth, from, you, let, this, then, be, your, war, cry, in, combats, because, this, word, is, given, to, you, by, god, when, an, armed, attack, is, made, upon, the, enemy, let, this, one, cry, be, raised, by, all, the, soldiers, of, god, it, is, the, will, of, god, it, is, the, will, of, god, within, fulcher, of, chartres, account, of, pope, urban, s, speech, there, was, a, promise, of, remission, of, sins, for, whoever, took, part, in, the, crusade, all, who, die, by, the, way, whether, by, land, or, by, sea, or, in, battle, against, the, pagans, shall, have, immediate, remission, of, sins, this, i, grant, them, through, the, power, of, god, with, which, i, am, invested, it, is, disputed, whether, the, famous, slogan, god, wills, it, or, it, is, the, will, of, god, deus, vult, in, latin, dieu, le, veut, in, french, in, fact, was, established, as, a, rallying, cry, during, the, council, while, robert, the, monk, says, so, it, is, also, possible, that, the, slogan, was, created, as, a, catchy, propaganda, motto, afterwards, urban, ii, s, own, letter, to, the, flemish, confirms, that, he, granted, remission, of, all, their, sins, to, those, undertaking, the, enterprise, to, liberate, the, eastern, churches, one, notable, contrast, with, the, speeches, recorded, by, robert, the, monk, guibert, of, nogent, and, baldric, of, dol, is, the, lesser, emphasis, on, jerusalem, itself, which, urban, only, once, mentions, as, his, own, focus, of, concern, in, the, letter, to, the, flemish, he, writes, they, have, seized, the, holy, city, of, christ, embellished, by, his, passion, and, resurrection, and, blasphemy, to, say, have, sold, her, and, her, churches, into, abominable, slavery, in, the, letters, to, bologna, and, vallombrosa, he, refers, to, the, crusaders, desire, to, set, out, for, jerusalem, rather, than, to, his, own, desire, that, jerusalem, be, freed, from, seljuk, rule, it, was, believed, that, originally, that, urban, wanted, to, send, a, relatively, small, force, to, aid, the, byzantines, however, after, meeting, with, two, prominent, members, of, the, crusades, adhemar, of, puy, and, raymond, of, saint, guilles, urban, decided, to, rally, a, much, larger, force, to, retake, jerusalem, urban, ii, refers, to, liberating, the, church, as, a, whole, or, the, eastern, churches, generally, rather, than, to, reconquering, jerusalem, itself, the, phrases, used, are, churches, of, god, in, the, eastern, region, and, the, eastern, churches, to, the, flemish, liberation, of, the, church, to, bologna, liberating, christianity, to, vallombrosa, and, the, asian, church, to, the, catalan, counts, coincidentally, or, not, fulcher, of, chartres, s, version, of, urban, s, speech, makes, no, explicit, reference, to, jerusalem, rather, it, more, generally, refers, to, aiding, the, crusaders, christian, brothers, of, the, eastern, shore, and, to, their, loss, of, asia, minor, to, the, turks, it, is, still, disputed, what, pope, urban, s, motives, were, as, evidenced, by, the, different, speeches, that, were, recorded, all, of, which, differ, from, each, other, some, historians, believe, that, urban, wished, for, the, reunification, of, the, eastern, and, western, churches, a, rift, that, was, caused, by, the, great, schism, of, 1054, others, believe, that, urban, saw, this, as, an, opportunity, to, gain, legitimacy, as, the, pope, as, at, the, time, he, was, contending, with, the, antipope, clement, iii, a, third, theory, is, that, urban, felt, threatened, by, the, seljuk, conquests, in, europe, and, saw, the, crusades, as, a, way, to, unite, the, christian, world, into, a, unified, defense, against, them, the, most, important, effect, of, the, first, crusade, for, urban, himself, was, the, removal, of, clement, iii, from, rome, in, 1097, by, one, of, the, french, armies, his, restoration, there, was, supported, by, matilda, of, tuscany, urban, ii, died, on, 29, july, 1099, fourteen, days, after, the, fall, of, jerusalem, but, before, news, of, the, event, had, reached, italy, his, successor, was, pope, paschal, ii, urban, was, involved, in, iberia, from, the, very, beginning, of, his, time, as, pontiff, of, his, involvements, in, iberia, there, were, two, main, engagements, namely, the, urban, here, gave, support, to, the, crusades, in, spain, against, the, moors, there, according, to, chevedden, urban, was, concerned, that, the, focus, on, the, east, and, jerusalem, would, neglect, the, fight, in, spain, he, saw, the, fight, in, the, east, and, in, spain, as, part, of, the, same, crusade, so, he, would, offer, the, same, remission, of, sin, for, those, that, fought, in, spain, and, discouraged, those, that, wished, to, travel, east, from, spain, a, similar, line, is, taken, by, erdmann, who, views, the, conflict, in, iberia, as, being, premeditated, by, the, mahdia, campaign, of, 1087, conducted, by, pope, victor, iii, due, to, the, granting, of, an, indulgence, this, campaign, erdmann, argues, was, considered, a, success, because, of, the, elevation, of, the, see, of, pisa, in, 1092, in, which, urban, acknowledges, the, recent, triumph, of, the, pisans, over, saracen, forces, urban, received, vital, support, in, his, conflict, with, the, byzantine, empire, romans, and, the, holy, roman, empire, from, the, norman, of, campania, and, sicily, in, return, he, granted, roger, i, the, freedom, to, appoint, bishops, the, right, of, lay, investiture, to, collect, church, revenues, before, forwarding, to, the, papacy, and, the, right, to, sit, in, judgment, on, ecclesiastical, questions, roger, i, virtually, became, a, legate, of, the, pope, within, sicily, in, 1098, these, were, extraordinary, prerogatives, that, popes, were, withholding, from, temporal, sovereigns, elsewhere, in, europe, and, that, later, led, to, bitter, confrontations, with, roger, s, hohenstaufen, heirs, pope, urban, was, beatified, in, 1881, by, pope, leo, xiii, with, his, feast, day, on, 29, july
