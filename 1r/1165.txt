descendant, of, rollo, he, was, duke, of, normandy, as, william, ii, from, 1035, onward, by, 1060, following, a, long, struggle, his, hold, on, normandy, was, secure, in, 1066, following, the, death, of, edward, the, confessor, william, invaded, england, leading, an, army, of, normans, to, victory, over, the, anglo, saxon, forces, of, harold, godwinson, at, the, battle, of, hastings, and, suppressed, subsequent, english, revolts, in, what, has, become, known, as, the, norman, conquest, the, rest, of, his, life, was, marked, by, struggles, to, consolidate, his, hold, over, england, and, his, continental, lands, and, by, difficulties, with, his, eldest, son, robert, curthose, william, was, the, son, of, the, unmarried, duke, robert, i, of, normandy, and, his, mistress, herleva, his, illegitimate, status, and, youth, caused, some, difficulties, for, him, after, he, succeeded, his, father, as, did, the, anarchy, which, plagued, the, first, years, of, his, rule, during, his, childhood, and, adolescence, members, of, the, norman, aristocracy, battled, each, other, both, for, control, of, the, child, duke, and, for, their, own, ends, in, 1047, william, quashed, a, rebellion, and, begin, to, establish, his, authority, over, the, duchy, a, process, that, was, not, complete, until, about, 1060, his, marriage, in, the, 1050s, to, matilda, of, flanders, provided, him, with, a, powerful, ally, in, the, neighbouring, county, of, flanders, by, the, time, of, his, marriage, william, was, able, to, arrange, the, appointment, of, his, supporters, as, bishops, and, abbots, in, the, norman, church, his, consolidation, of, power, allowed, him, to, expand, his, horizons, and, he, secured, control, of, the, neighbouring, county, of, maine, by, 1062, in, the, 1050s, and, early, 1060s, william, became, a, contender, for, the, throne, of, england, held, by, the, childless, edward, the, confessor, his, first, cousin, once, removed, there, were, other, potential, claimants, including, the, powerful, english, earl, harold, godwinson, whom, edward, named, as, king, on, his, deathbed, in, january, 1066, arguing, that, edward, had, previously, promised, the, throne, to, him, and, that, harold, had, sworn, to, support, his, claim, william, built, a, large, fleet, and, invaded, england, in, september, 1066, he, decisively, defeated, and, killed, harold, at, the, battle, of, hastings, on, 14, october, 1066, after, further, military, efforts, william, was, crowned, king, on, christmas, day, 1066, in, london, he, made, arrangements, for, the, governance, of, england, in, early, 1067, before, returning, to, normandy, several, unsuccessful, rebellions, followed, but, william, s, hold, was, mostly, secure, on, england, by, 1075, allowing, him, to, spend, the, greater, part, of, his, reign, in, continental, europe, william, s, final, years, were, marked, by, difficulties, in, his, continental, domains, troubles, with, his, son, robert, and, threatened, invasions, of, england, by, the, danes, in, 1086, he, ordered, the, compilation, of, the, domesday, book, a, survey, listing, all, of, the, land, holdings, in, england, along, with, their, pre, conquest, and, current, holders, he, died, in, september, 1087, while, leading, a, campaign, in, northern, france, and, was, buried, in, caen, his, reign, in, england, was, marked, by, the, construction, of, castles, settling, a, new, norman, nobility, on, the, land, and, change, in, the, composition, of, the, english, clergy, he, did, not, try, to, integrate, his, domains, into, one, empire, but, continued, to, administer, each, part, separately, his, lands, were, divided, after, his, death, normandy, went, to, robert, and, england, went, to, his, second, surviving, son, william, rufus, norsemen, first, began, raiding, in, what, became, normandy, in, the, late, 8th, century, permanent, scandinavian, settlement, occurred, before, 911, when, rollo, one, of, the, viking, leaders, and, king, charles, the, simple, of, france, reached, an, agreement, ceding, the, county, of, rouen, to, rollo, the, lands, around, rouen, became, the, core, of, the, later, duchy, of, normandy, normandy, may, have, been, used, as, a, base, when, scandinavian, attacks, on, england, were, renewed, at, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, which, would, have, worsened, relations, between, england, and, normandy, in, an, effort, to, improve, matters, king, thelred, the, unready, took, emma, sister, of, richard, ii, duke, of, normandy, as, his, second, wife, in, 1002, danish, raids, on, england, continued, and, thelred, sought, help, from, richard, taking, refuge, in, normandy, in, 1013, when, king, swein, i, of, denmark, drove, thelred, and, his, family, from, england, swein, s, death, in, 1014, allowed, thelred, to, return, home, but, swein, s, son, cnut, contested, thelred, s, return, thelred, died, unexpectedly, in, 1016, and, cnut, became, king, of, england, thelred, and, emma, s, two, sons, edward, and, alfred, went, into, exile, in, normandy, while, their, mother, emma, became, cnut, s, second, wife, after, cnut, s, death, in, 1035, the, english, throne, fell, to, harold, harefoot, his, son, by, his, first, wife, while, harthacnut, his, son, by, emma, became, king, in, denmark, england, remained, unstable, alfred, returned, to, england, in, 1036, to, visit, his, mother, and, perhaps, to, challenge, harold, as, king, one, story, implicates, earl, godwin, of, wessex, in, alfred, s, subsequent, death, but, others, blame, harold, emma, went, into, exile, in, flanders, until, harthacnut, became, king, following, harold, s, death, in, 1040, and, his, half, brother, edward, followed, harthacnut, to, england, edward, was, proclaimed, king, after, harthacnut, s, death, in, june, 1042, william, was, born, in, 1027, or, 1028, at, falaise, duchy, of, normandy, most, likely, towards, the, end, of, 1028, he, was, the, only, son, of, robert, i, son, of, richard, ii, his, mother, herleva, was, a, daughter, of, fulbert, of, falaise, who, may, have, been, a, tanner, or, embalmer, herleva, was, possibly, a, member, of, the, ducal, household, but, did, not, marry, robert, she, later, married, herluin, de, conteville, with, whom, she, had, two, sons, odo, of, bayeux, and, count, robert, of, mortain, and, a, daughter, whose, name, is, unknown, one, of, herleva, s, brothers, walter, became, a, supporter, and, protector, of, william, during, his, minority, robert, i, also, had, a, daughter, adelaide, by, another, mistress, robert, i, succeeded, his, elder, brother, richard, iii, as, duke, on, 6, august, 1027, the, brothers, had, been, at, odds, over, the, succession, and, richard, s, death, was, sudden, robert, was, accused, by, some, writers, of, killing, richard, a, plausible, but, now, unprovable, charge, conditions, in, normandy, were, unsettled, as, noble, families, despoiled, the, church, and, alan, iii, of, brittany, waged, war, against, the, duchy, possibly, in, an, attempt, to, take, control, by, 1031, robert, had, gathered, considerable, support, from, noblemen, many, of, whom, would, become, prominent, during, william, s, life, they, included, the, duke, s, uncle, robert, the, archbishop, of, rouen, who, had, originally, opposed, the, duke, osbern, a, nephew, of, gunnor, the, wife, of, richard, i, and, gilbert, of, brionne, a, grandson, of, richard, i, after, his, accession, robert, continued, norman, support, for, the, english, princes, edward, and, alfred, who, were, still, in, exile, in, northern, france, robert, may, have, been, briefly, betrothed, to, a, daughter, of, king, cnut, but, no, marriage, took, place, it, is, unclear, whether, william, would, have, been, supplanted, in, the, ducal, succession, if, robert, had, had, a, legitimate, son, earlier, dukes, had, been, illegitimate, and, william, s, association, with, his, father, on, ducal, charters, appears, to, indicate, that, william, was, considered, robert, s, most, likely, heir, in, 1034, the, duke, decided, to, go, on, pilgrimage, to, jerusalem, although, some, of, his, supporters, tried, to, dissuade, him, he, convened, a, council, in, january, 1035, and, had, the, assembled, norman, magnates, swear, fealty, to, william, as, his, heir, before, leaving, for, jerusalem, he, died, in, early, july, at, nicea, on, his, way, back, to, normandy, william, faced, several, challenges, on, becoming, duke, including, his, illegitimate, birth, and, his, youth, he, was, either, seven, or, eight, years, old, he, enjoyed, the, support, of, his, great, uncle, archbishop, robert, as, well, as, king, henry, i, of, france, enabling, him, to, succeed, to, his, father, s, duchy, the, support, given, to, the, exiled, english, princes, in, their, attempt, to, return, to, england, in, 1036, shows, that, the, new, duke, s, guardians, were, attempting, to, continue, his, father, s, policies, but, archbishop, robert, s, death, in, march, 1037, removed, one, of, william, s, main, supporters, and, normandy, quickly, descended, into, chaos, the, anarchy, in, the, duchy, lasted, until, 1047, and, control, of, the, young, duke, was, one, of, the, priorities, of, those, contending, for, power, at, first, alan, of, brittany, had, custody, of, the, duke, but, when, alan, died, in, either, late, 1039, or, october, 1040, gilbert, of, brionne, took, charge, of, william, gilbert, was, killed, within, months, and, another, guardian, turchetil, was, also, killed, around, the, time, of, gilbert, s, death, yet, another, guardian, osbern, was, slain, in, the, early, 1040s, in, william, s, chamber, while, the, duke, slept, it, was, said, that, walter, william, s, maternal, uncle, was, occasionally, forced, to, hide, the, young, duke, in, the, houses, of, peasants, although, this, story, may, be, an, embellishment, by, orderic, vitalis, the, historian, eleanor, searle, speculates, that, william, was, raised, with, the, three, cousins, who, later, became, important, in, his, career, william, fitzosbern, roger, de, beaumont, and, roger, of, montgomery, although, many, of, the, norman, nobles, engaged, in, their, own, private, wars, and, feuds, during, william, s, minority, the, viscounts, still, acknowledged, the, ducal, government, and, the, ecclesiastical, hierarchy, was, supportive, of, william, king, henry, continued, to, support, the, young, duke, but, in, late, 1046, opponents, of, william, came, together, in, a, rebellion, centred, in, lower, normandy, led, by, guy, of, burgundy, with, support, from, nigel, viscount, of, the, cotentin, and, ranulf, viscount, of, the, bessin, according, to, stories, that, may, have, legendary, elements, an, attempt, was, made, to, seize, william, at, valognes, but, he, escaped, under, cover, of, darkness, seeking, refuge, with, king, henry, in, early, 1047, henry, and, william, returned, to, normandy, and, were, victorious, at, the, battle, of, val, s, dunes, near, caen, although, few, details, of, the, fighting, are, recorded, william, of, poitiers, claimed, that, the, battle, was, won, mainly, through, william, s, efforts, but, earlier, accounts, claim, that, king, henry, s, men, and, leadership, also, played, an, important, part, william, assumed, power, in, normandy, and, shortly, after, the, battle, promulgated, the, truce, of, god, throughout, his, duchy, in, an, effort, to, limit, warfare, and, violence, by, restricting, the, days, of, the, year, on, which, fighting, was, permitted, although, the, battle, of, val, s, dunes, marked, a, turning, point, in, william, s, control, of, the, duchy, it, was, not, the, end, of, his, struggle, to, gain, the, upper, hand, over, the, nobility, the, period, from, 1047, to, 1054, saw, almost, continuous, warfare, with, lesser, crises, continuing, until, 1060, william, s, next, efforts, were, against, guy, of, burgundy, who, retreated, to, his, castle, at, brionne, which, william, besieged, after, a, long, effort, the, duke, succeeded, in, exiling, guy, in, 1050, to, address, the, growing, power, of, the, count, of, anjou, geoffrey, martel, william, joined, with, king, henry, in, a, campaign, against, him, the, last, known, cooperation, between, the, two, they, succeeded, in, capturing, an, angevin, fortress, but, accomplished, little, else, geoffrey, attempted, to, expand, his, authority, into, the, county, of, maine, especially, after, the, death, of, hugh, iv, of, maine, in, 1051, central, to, the, control, of, maine, were, the, holdings, of, the, bell, me, family, who, held, bell, me, on, the, border, of, maine, and, normandy, as, well, as, the, fortresses, at, alen, on, and, domfront, bell, me, s, overlord, was, the, king, of, france, but, domfront, was, under, the, overlordship, of, geoffrey, martel, and, duke, william, was, alen, on, s, overlord, the, bell, me, family, whose, lands, were, quite, strategically, placed, between, their, three, different, overlords, were, able, to, play, each, of, them, against, the, other, and, secure, virtual, independence, for, themselves, on, the, death, of, hugh, of, maine, geoffrey, martel, occupied, maine, in, a, move, contested, by, william, and, king, henry, eventually, they, succeeded, in, driving, geoffrey, from, the, county, and, in, the, process, william, secured, the, bell, me, family, strongholds, at, alen, on, and, domfront, for, himself, he, was, thus, able, to, assert, his, overlordship, over, the, bell, me, family, and, compel, them, to, act, consistently, with, norman, interests, however, in, 1052, the, king, and, geoffrey, martel, made, common, cause, against, william, as, some, norman, nobles, began, to, contest, william, s, increasing, power, henry, s, about, face, was, probably, motivated, by, a, desire, to, retain, dominance, over, normandy, which, was, now, threatened, by, william, s, growing, mastery, of, his, duchy, william, was, engaged, in, military, actions, against, his, own, nobles, throughout, 1053, as, well, as, with, the, new, archbishop, of, rouen, mauger, in, february, 1054, the, king, and, the, norman, rebels, launched, a, double, invasion, of, the, duchy, henry, led, the, main, thrust, through, the, county, of, vreux, while, the, other, wing, under, the, king, s, half, brother, odo, invaded, eastern, normandy, william, met, the, invasion, by, dividing, his, forces, into, two, the, first, which, he, led, faced, henry, the, second, which, included, some, who, became, william, s, firm, supporters, such, as, robert, count, of, eu, walter, giffard, roger, of, mortemer, and, william, de, warenne, faced, the, other, invading, force, this, second, force, defeated, the, invaders, at, the, battle, of, mortemer, in, addition, to, ending, both, invasions, the, battle, allowed, the, duke, s, ecclesiastical, supporters, to, depose, archbishop, mauger, mortemer, thus, marked, another, turning, point, in, william, s, growing, control, of, the, duchy, although, his, conflict, with, the, french, king, and, the, count, of, anjou, continued, until, 1060, henry, and, geoffrey, led, another, invasion, of, normandy, in, 1057, but, were, defeated, by, william, at, the, battle, of, varaville, this, was, the, last, invasion, of, normandy, during, william, s, lifetime, in, 1058, william, invaded, the, county, of, dreux, and, took, tilli, res, sur, avre, and, thimert, henry, attempted, to, dislodge, william, but, the, siege, of, thimert, dragged, on, for, two, years, until, henry, s, death, the, deaths, of, count, geoffrey, and, the, king, in, 1060, cemented, the, shift, in, the, balance, of, power, towards, william, one, factor, in, william, s, favour, was, his, marriage, to, matilda, of, flanders, the, daughter, of, count, baldwin, v, of, flanders, the, union, was, arranged, in, 1049, but, pope, leo, ix, forbade, the, marriage, at, the, council, of, rheims, in, october, 1049, the, marriage, nevertheless, went, ahead, in, the, early, 1050s, possibly, unsanctioned, by, the, pope, according, to, a, late, source, not, generally, considered, to, be, reliable, papal, sanction, was, not, secured, until, 1059, but, as, papal, norman, relations, in, the, 1050s, were, generally, good, and, norman, clergy, were, able, to, visit, rome, in, 1050, without, incident, it, was, probably, secured, earlier, papal, sanction, of, the, marriage, appears, to, have, required, the, founding, of, two, monasteries, in, caen, one, by, william, and, one, by, matilda, the, marriage, was, important, in, bolstering, william, s, status, as, flanders, was, one, of, the, more, powerful, french, territories, with, ties, to, the, french, royal, house, and, to, the, german, emperors, contemporary, writers, considered, the, marriage, which, produced, four, sons, and, five, or, six, daughters, to, be, a, success, no, authentic, portrait, of, william, has, been, found, the, contemporary, depictions, of, him, on, the, bayeux, tapestry, and, on, his, seals, and, coins, are, conventional, representations, designed, to, assert, his, authority, there, are, some, written, descriptions, of, a, burly, and, robust, appearance, with, a, guttural, voice, he, enjoyed, excellent, health, until, old, age, although, he, became, quite, fat, in, later, life, he, was, strong, enough, to, draw, bows, that, others, were, unable, to, pull, and, had, great, stamina, geoffrey, martel, described, him, as, without, equal, as, a, fighter, and, horseman, examination, of, william, s, femur, the, only, bone, to, survive, when, the, rest, of, his, remains, were, destroyed, showed, he, was, approximately, 5, feet, 10, inches, 1, 78, m, tall, there, are, records, of, two, tutors, for, william, during, the, late, 1030s, and, early, 1040s, but, the, extent, of, his, literary, education, is, unclear, he, was, not, known, as, a, patron, of, authors, and, there, is, little, evidence, that, he, sponsored, scholarships, or, intellectual, activities, orderic, vitalis, records, that, william, tried, to, learn, to, read, old, english, late, in, life, but, he, was, unable, to, devote, sufficient, time, to, the, effort, and, quickly, gave, up, william, s, main, hobby, appears, to, have, been, hunting, his, marriage, to, matilda, appears, to, have, been, quite, affectionate, and, there, are, no, signs, that, he, was, unfaithful, to, her, unusual, in, a, medieval, monarch, medieval, writers, criticised, william, for, his, greed, and, cruelty, but, his, personal, piety, was, universally, praised, by, contemporaries, norman, government, under, william, was, similar, to, the, government, that, had, existed, under, earlier, dukes, it, was, a, fairly, simple, administrative, system, built, around, the, ducal, household, a, group, of, officers, including, stewards, butlers, and, marshals, the, duke, travelled, constantly, around, the, duchy, confirming, charters, and, collecting, revenues, most, of, the, income, came, from, the, ducal, lands, as, well, as, from, tolls, and, a, few, taxes, this, income, was, collected, by, the, chamber, one, of, the, household, departments, william, cultivated, close, relations, with, the, church, in, his, duchy, he, took, part, in, church, councils, and, made, several, appointments, to, the, norman, episcopate, including, the, appointment, of, maurilius, as, archbishop, of, rouen, another, important, appointment, was, that, of, william, s, half, brother, odo, as, bishop, of, bayeux, in, 1049, or, 1050, he, also, relied, on, the, clergy, for, advice, including, lanfranc, a, non, norman, who, rose, to, become, one, of, william, s, prominent, ecclesiastical, advisors, from, the, late, 1040s, through, the, 1060s, william, gave, generously, to, the, church, from, 1035, to, 1066, the, norman, aristocracy, founded, at, least, twenty, new, monastic, houses, including, william, s, two, monasteries, in, caen, a, remarkable, expansion, of, religious, life, in, the, duchy, in, 1051, the, childless, king, edward, of, england, appears, to, have, chosen, william, as, his, successor, william, was, the, grandson, of, edward, s, maternal, uncle, richard, ii, of, normandy, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, in, the, d, version, states, that, william, visited, england, in, the, later, part, of, 1051, perhaps, to, secure, confirmation, of, the, succession, or, perhaps, to, secure, aid, for, his, troubles, in, normandy, the, trip, is, unlikely, given, william, s, absorption, in, warfare, with, anjou, at, the, time, whatever, edward, s, wishes, it, was, likely, that, any, claim, by, william, would, be, opposed, by, godwin, earl, of, wessex, a, member, of, the, most, powerful, family, in, england, edward, had, married, edith, godwin, s, daughter, in, 1043, and, godwin, appears, to, have, been, one, of, the, main, supporters, of, edward, s, claim, to, the, throne, by, 1050, however, relations, between, the, king, and, the, earl, had, soured, culminating, in, a, crisis, in, 1051, that, led, to, the, exile, of, godwin, and, his, family, from, england, during, this, exile, edward, offered, the, throne, to, william, godwin, returned, from, exile, in, 1052, with, armed, forces, and, a, settlement, was, reached, between, the, king, and, the, earl, restoring, the, earl, and, his, family, to, their, lands, and, replacing, robert, of, jumi, ges, a, norman, whom, edward, had, named, archbishop, of, canterbury, with, stigand, the, bishop, of, winchester, no, english, source, mentions, a, supposed, embassy, by, archbishop, robert, to, william, conveying, the, promise, of, the, succession, and, the, two, norman, sources, that, mention, it, william, of, jumi, ges, and, william, of, poitiers, are, not, precise, in, their, chronology, of, when, this, visit, took, place, count, herbert, ii, of, maine, died, in, 1062, and, william, who, had, betrothed, his, eldest, son, robert, to, herbert, s, sister, margaret, claimed, the, county, through, his, son, local, nobles, resisted, the, claim, but, william, invaded, and, by, 1064, had, secured, control, of, the, area, william, appointed, a, norman, to, the, bishopric, of, le, mans, in, 1065, he, also, allowed, his, son, robert, curthose, to, do, homage, to, the, new, count, of, anjou, geoffrey, the, bearded, william, s, western, border, was, thus, secured, but, his, border, with, brittany, remained, insecure, in, 1064, william, invaded, brittany, in, a, campaign, that, remains, obscure, in, its, details, its, effect, though, was, to, destabilise, brittany, forcing, the, duke, conan, ii, to, focus, on, internal, problems, rather, than, on, expansion, conan, s, death, in, 1066, further, secured, william, s, borders, in, normandy, william, also, benefited, from, his, campaign, in, brittany, by, securing, the, support, of, some, breton, nobles, who, went, on, to, support, the, invasion, of, england, in, 1066, earl, godwin, died, in, 1053, harold, succeeded, to, his, father, s, earldom, and, another, son, tostig, became, earl, of, northumbria, other, sons, were, granted, earldoms, later, gyrth, as, earl, of, east, anglia, in, 1057, and, leofwine, as, earl, of, kent, sometime, between, 1055, and, 1057, some, sources, claim, that, harold, took, part, in, william, s, breton, campaign, of, 1064, and, swore, to, uphold, william, s, claim, to, the, english, throne, but, no, english, source, reports, this, trip, and, it, is, unclear, if, it, actually, occurred, it, may, have, been, norman, propaganda, designed, to, discredit, harold, who, had, emerged, as, the, main, contender, to, succeed, king, edward, meanwhile, another, contender, for, the, throne, had, emerged, edward, the, exile, son, of, edmund, ironside, and, a, grandson, of, thelred, ii, returned, to, england, in, 1057, although, he, died, shortly, after, his, return, he, brought, with, him, his, family, which, included, two, daughters, margaret, and, christina, and, a, son, edgar, the, theling, in, 1065, northumbria, revolted, against, tostig, and, the, rebels, chose, morcar, the, younger, brother, of, edwin, earl, of, mercia, as, earl, harold, perhaps, to, secure, the, support, of, edwin, and, morcar, in, his, bid, for, the, throne, supported, the, rebels, and, persuaded, king, edward, to, replace, tostig, with, morcar, tostig, went, into, exile, in, flanders, with, his, wife, judith, who, was, the, daughter, of, baldwin, iv, count, of, flanders, edward, was, ailing, and, he, died, on, 5, january, 1066, it, is, unclear, what, exactly, happened, at, edward, s, deathbed, one, story, deriving, from, the, vita, dwardi, a, biography, of, edward, claims, that, he, was, attended, by, his, wife, edith, harold, archbishop, stigand, and, robert, fitzwimarc, and, that, the, king, named, harold, as, his, successor, the, norman, sources, do, not, dispute, that, harold, was, named, as, the, next, king, but, they, declare, that, harold, s, oath, and, edward, s, earlier, promise, of, the, throne, could, not, be, changed, on, edward, s, deathbed, later, english, sources, stated, that, harold, had, been, elected, as, king, by, the, clergy, and, magnates, of, england, harold, was, crowned, on, 6, january, 1066, in, edward, s, new, norman, style, westminster, abbey, although, some, controversy, surrounds, who, performed, the, ceremony, english, sources, claim, that, ealdred, the, archbishop, of, york, performed, the, ceremony, while, norman, sources, state, that, the, coronation, was, performed, by, stigand, who, was, considered, a, non, canonical, archbishop, by, the, papacy, harold, s, claim, to, the, throne, was, not, entirely, secure, as, there, were, other, claimants, perhaps, including, his, exiled, brother, tostig, king, harald, hardrada, of, norway, also, had, a, claim, to, the, throne, as, the, uncle, and, heir, of, king, magnus, i, who, had, made, a, pact, with, harthacnut, around, 1040, that, if, either, magnus, or, harthacnut, died, without, heirs, the, other, would, succeed, the, last, claimant, was, william, of, normandy, against, whose, anticipated, invasion, king, harold, godwinson, made, most, of, his, preparations, harold, s, brother, tostig, made, probing, attacks, along, the, southern, coast, of, england, in, may, 1066, landing, at, the, isle, of, wight, using, a, fleet, supplied, by, baldwin, of, flanders, tostig, appears, to, have, received, little, local, support, and, further, raids, into, lincolnshire, and, near, the, humber, met, with, no, more, success, so, he, retreated, to, scotland, according, to, the, norman, writer, william, of, jumi, ges, william, had, meanwhile, sent, an, embassy, to, king, harold, godwinson, to, remind, harold, of, his, oath, to, support, william, s, claim, although, whether, this, embassy, actually, occurred, is, unclear, harold, assembled, an, army, and, a, fleet, to, repel, william, s, anticipated, invasion, force, deploying, troops, and, ships, along, the, english, channel, for, most, of, the, summer, william, of, poitiers, describes, a, council, called, by, duke, william, in, which, the, writer, gives, an, account, of, a, debate, between, william, s, nobles, and, supporters, over, whether, to, risk, an, invasion, of, england, although, some, sort, of, formal, assembly, probably, was, held, it, is, unlikely, that, any, debate, took, place, the, duke, had, by, then, established, control, over, his, nobles, and, most, of, those, assembled, would, have, been, anxious, to, secure, their, share, of, the, rewards, from, the, conquest, of, england, william, of, poitiers, also, relates, that, the, duke, obtained, the, consent, of, pope, alexander, ii, for, the, invasion, along, with, a, papal, banner, the, chronicler, also, claimed, that, the, duke, secured, the, support, of, henry, iv, holy, roman, emperor, and, king, sweyn, ii, of, denmark, henry, was, still, a, minor, however, and, sweyn, was, more, likely, to, support, harold, who, could, then, help, sweyn, against, the, norwegian, king, so, these, claims, should, be, treated, with, caution, although, alexander, gave, papal, approval, to, the, conquest, after, it, succeeded, no, other, source, claims, papal, support, prior, to, the, invasion, events, after, the, invasion, which, included, the, penance, william, performed, and, statements, by, later, popes, lend, circumstantial, support, to, the, claim, of, papal, approval, to, deal, with, norman, affairs, william, put, the, government, of, normandy, into, the, hands, of, his, wife, for, the, duration, of, the, invasion, throughout, the, summer, william, assembled, an, army, and, an, invasion, fleet, in, normandy, although, william, of, jumi, ges, s, claim, that, the, ducal, fleet, numbered, 3, 000, ships, is, clearly, an, exaggeration, it, was, probably, large, and, mostly, built, from, scratch, although, william, of, poitiers, and, william, of, jumi, ges, disagree, about, where, the, fleet, was, built, poitiers, states, it, was, constructed, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, dives, while, jumi, ges, states, it, was, built, at, saint, valery, sur, somme, both, agree, that, it, eventually, sailed, from, valery, sur, somme, the, fleet, carried, an, invasion, force, that, included, in, addition, to, troops, from, william, s, territories, of, normandy, and, maine, large, numbers, of, mercenaries, allies, and, volunteers, from, brittany, northeastern, france, and, flanders, together, with, smaller, numbers, from, other, parts, of, europe, although, the, army, and, fleet, were, ready, by, early, august, adverse, winds, kept, the, ships, in, normandy, until, late, september, there, were, probably, other, reasons, for, william, s, delay, including, intelligence, reports, from, england, revealing, that, harold, s, forces, were, deployed, along, the, coast, william, would, have, preferred, to, delay, the, invasion, until, he, could, make, an, unopposed, landing, harold, kept, his, forces, on, alert, throughout, the, summer, but, with, the, arrival, of, the, harvest, season, he, disbanded, his, army, on, 8, september, tostig, godwinson, and, harald, hardrada, invaded, northumbria, in, september, 1066, and, defeated, the, local, forces, under, morcar, and, edwin, at, the, battle, of, fulford, near, york, king, harold, received, word, of, their, invasion, and, marched, north, defeating, the, invaders, and, killing, tostig, and, hardrada, on, 25, september, at, the, battle, of, stamford, bridge, the, norman, fleet, finally, set, sail, two, days, later, landing, in, england, at, pevensey, bay, on, 28, september, william, then, moved, to, hastings, a, few, miles, to, the, east, where, he, built, a, castle, as, a, base, of, operations, from, there, he, ravaged, the, interior, and, waited, for, harold, s, return, from, the, north, refusing, to, venture, far, from, the, sea, his, line, of, communication, with, normandy, after, defeating, harald, hardrada, and, tostig, harold, left, much, of, his, army, in, the, north, including, morcar, and, edwin, and, marched, the, rest, south, to, deal, with, the, threatened, norman, invasion, he, probably, learned, of, william, s, landing, while, he, was, travelling, south, harold, stopped, in, london, for, about, a, week, before, marching, to, hastings, so, it, is, likely, that, he, spent, about, a, week, on, his, march, south, averaging, about, 27, miles, 43, kilometres, per, day, for, the, distance, of, approximately, 200, miles, 320, kilometres, although, harold, attempted, to, surprise, the, normans, william, s, scouts, reported, the, english, arrival, to, the, duke, the, exact, events, preceding, the, battle, are, obscure, with, contradictory, accounts, in, the, sources, but, all, agree, that, william, led, his, army, from, his, castle, and, advanced, towards, the, enemy, harold, had, taken, a, defensive, position, at, the, top, of, senlac, hill, present, day, battle, east, sussex, about, 6, miles, 9, 7, kilometres, from, william, s, castle, at, hastings, the, battle, began, at, about, 9, am, on, 14, october, and, lasted, all, day, while, a, broad, outline, is, known, the, exact, events, are, obscured, by, contradictory, accounts, although, the, numbers, on, each, side, were, about, equal, william, had, both, cavalry, and, infantry, including, many, archers, while, harold, had, only, foot, soldiers, and, few, if, any, archers, the, english, soldiers, formed, up, as, a, shield, wall, along, the, ridge, and, were, at, first, so, effective, that, william, s, army, was, thrown, back, with, heavy, casualties, some, of, william, s, breton, troops, panicked, and, fled, and, some, of, the, english, troops, appear, to, have, pursued, the, fleeing, bretons, until, they, themselves, were, attacked, and, destroyed, by, norman, cavalry, during, the, bretons, flight, rumours, swept, through, the, norman, forces, that, the, duke, had, been, killed, but, william, succeeded, in, rallying, his, troops, two, further, norman, retreats, were, feigned, to, draw, the, english, into, pursuit, and, expose, them, to, repeated, attacks, by, the, norman, cavalry, the, available, sources, are, more, confused, about, events, in, the, afternoon, but, it, appears, that, the, decisive, event, was, harold, s, death, about, which, differing, stories, are, told, william, of, jumi, ges, claimed, that, harold, was, killed, by, the, duke, the, bayeux, tapestry, has, been, claimed, to, show, harold, s, death, by, an, arrow, to, the, eye, but, that, may, be, a, later, reworking, of, the, tapestry, to, conform, to, 12th, century, stories, in, which, harold, was, slain, by, an, arrow, wound, to, the, head, harold, s, body, was, identified, the, day, after, the, battle, either, through, his, armour, or, marks, on, his, body, the, english, dead, including, some, of, harold, s, brothers, and, his, housecarls, were, left, on, the, battlefield, gytha, thorkelsd, ttir, harold, s, mother, offered, the, duke, the, weight, of, her, son, s, body, in, gold, for, it, but, her, offer, was, refused, william, ordered, the, body, thrown, into, the, sea, but, whether, that, took, place, is, unclear, waltham, abbey, which, harold, founded, later, claimed, that, his, body, had, been, secretly, buried, there, william, may, have, hoped, the, english, would, surrender, following, his, victory, but, they, did, not, instead, some, of, the, english, clergy, and, magnates, nominated, edgar, the, theling, as, king, though, their, support, for, edgar, was, only, lukewarm, after, waiting, a, short, while, william, secured, dover, parts, of, kent, and, canterbury, while, also, sending, a, force, to, capture, winchester, where, the, royal, treasury, was, these, captures, secured, william, s, rear, areas, and, his, line, of, retreat, to, normandy, if, that, was, needed, william, then, marched, to, southwark, across, the, thames, from, london, which, he, reached, in, late, november, next, he, led, his, forces, around, the, south, and, west, of, london, burning, along, the, way, he, finally, crossed, the, thames, at, wallingford, in, early, december, stigand, submitted, to, william, there, and, when, the, duke, moved, on, to, berkhamsted, soon, afterwards, edgar, the, theling, morcar, edwin, and, ealdred, also, submitted, william, then, sent, forces, into, london, to, construct, a, castle, he, was, crowned, at, westminster, abbey, on, christmas, day, 1066, william, remained, in, england, after, his, coronation, and, tried, to, reconcile, the, native, magnates, the, remaining, earls, edwin, of, mercia, morcar, of, northumbria, and, waltheof, of, northampton, were, confirmed, in, their, lands, and, titles, waltheof, was, married, to, william, s, niece, judith, daughter, of, his, half, sister, adelaide, and, a, marriage, between, edwin, and, one, of, william, s, daughters, was, proposed, edgar, the, theling, also, appears, to, have, been, given, lands, ecclesiastical, offices, continued, to, be, held, by, the, same, bishops, as, before, the, invasion, including, the, uncanonical, stigand, but, the, families, of, harold, and, his, brothers, lost, their, lands, as, did, some, others, who, had, fought, against, william, at, hastings, by, march, william, was, secure, enough, to, return, to, normandy, but, he, took, with, him, stigand, morcar, edwin, edgar, and, waltheof, he, left, his, half, brother, odo, the, bishop, of, bayeux, in, charge, of, england, along, with, another, influential, supporter, william, fitzosbern, the, son, of, his, former, guardian, both, men, were, also, named, to, earldoms, fitzosbern, to, hereford, or, wessex, and, odo, to, kent, although, he, put, two, normans, in, overall, charge, he, retained, many, of, the, native, english, sheriffs, once, in, normandy, the, new, english, king, went, to, rouen, and, the, abbey, of, fecamp, and, then, attended, the, consecration, of, new, churches, at, two, norman, monasteries, while, william, was, in, normandy, a, former, ally, eustace, the, count, of, boulogne, invaded, at, dover, but, was, repulsed, english, resistance, had, also, begun, with, eadric, the, wild, attacking, hereford, and, revolts, at, exeter, where, harold, s, mother, gytha, was, a, focus, of, resistance, fitzosbern, and, odo, found, it, difficult, to, control, the, native, population, and, undertook, a, programme, of, castle, building, to, maintain, their, hold, on, the, kingdom, william, returned, to, england, in, december, 1067, and, marched, on, exeter, which, he, besieged, the, town, held, out, for, 18, days, after, it, fell, to, william, he, built, a, castle, to, secure, his, control, harold, s, sons, were, meanwhile, raiding, the, southwest, of, england, from, a, base, in, ireland, their, forces, landed, near, bristol, but, were, defeated, by, eadnoth, by, easter, william, was, at, winchester, where, he, was, soon, joined, by, his, wife, matilda, who, was, crowned, in, may, 1068, in, 1068, edwin, and, morcar, rose, in, revolt, supported, by, gospatric, earl, of, northumbria, orderic, vitalis, states, that, edwin, s, reason, for, revolting, was, that, the, proposed, marriage, between, himself, and, one, of, william, s, daughters, had, not, taken, place, but, another, reason, probably, included, the, increasing, power, of, fitzosbern, in, herefordshire, which, affected, edwin, s, power, within, his, own, earldom, the, king, marched, through, edwin, s, lands, and, built, warwick, castle, edwin, and, morcar, submitted, but, william, continued, on, to, york, building, york, and, nottingham, castles, before, returning, south, on, his, southbound, journey, he, began, constructing, lincoln, huntingdon, and, cambridge, castles, william, placed, supporters, in, charge, of, these, new, fortifications, among, them, william, peverel, at, nottingham, and, henry, de, beaumont, at, warwick, then, returned, to, normandy, late, in, 1068, early, in, 1069, edgar, the, theling, revolted, and, attacked, york, although, william, returned, to, york, and, built, another, castle, edgar, remained, free, and, in, the, autumn, he, joined, up, with, king, sweyn, the, danish, king, had, brought, a, large, fleet, to, england, and, attacked, not, only, york, but, exeter, and, shrewsbury, york, was, captured, by, the, combined, forces, of, edgar, and, sweyn, edgar, was, proclaimed, king, by, his, supporters, william, responded, swiftly, ignoring, a, continental, revolt, in, maine, and, symbolically, wore, his, crown, in, the, ruins, of, york, on, christmas, day, 1069, he, then, bought, off, the, danes, he, marched, to, the, river, tees, ravaging, the, countryside, as, he, went, edgar, having, lost, much, of, his, support, fled, to, scotland, where, king, malcolm, iii, was, married, to, edgar, s, sister, margaret, waltheof, who, had, joined, the, revolt, submitted, along, with, gospatric, and, both, were, allowed, to, retain, their, lands, william, marched, over, the, pennines, during, the, winter, and, defeated, the, remaining, rebels, at, shrewsbury, before, building, chester, and, stafford, castles, this, campaign, which, included, the, burning, and, destruction, of, part, of, the, countryside, that, the, royal, forces, marched, through, is, usually, known, as, the, harrying, of, the, north, it, was, over, by, april, 1070, when, william, wore, his, crown, ceremonially, for, easter, at, winchester, while, at, winchester, in, 1070, william, met, with, three, papal, legates, john, minutus, peter, and, ermenfrid, of, sion, who, had, been, sent, by, the, pope, the, legates, ceremonially, crowned, william, during, the, easter, court, the, historian, david, bates, sees, this, coronation, as, the, ceremonial, papal, seal, of, approval, for, william, s, conquest, the, legates, and, the, king, then, held, a, series, of, ecclesiastical, councils, dedicated, to, reforming, and, reorganising, the, english, church, stigand, and, his, brother, thelm, r, the, bishop, of, elmham, were, deposed, from, their, bishoprics, some, of, the, native, abbots, were, also, deposed, both, at, the, council, held, near, easter, and, at, a, further, one, near, whitsun, the, whitsun, council, saw, the, appointment, of, lanfranc, as, the, new, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, thomas, of, bayeux, as, the, new, archbishop, of, york, to, replace, ealdred, who, had, died, in, september, 1069, william, s, half, brother, odo, perhaps, expected, to, be, appointed, to, canterbury, but, william, probably, did, not, wish, to, give, that, much, power, to, a, family, member, another, reason, for, the, appointment, may, have, been, pressure, from, the, papacy, to, appoint, lanfranc, norman, clergy, were, appointed, to, replace, the, deposed, bishops, and, abbots, and, at, the, end, of, the, process, only, native, english, bishops, remained, in, office, along, with, several, continental, prelates, appointed, by, edward, the, confessor, in, 1070, william, also, founded, battle, abbey, a, new, monastery, at, the, site, of, the, battle, of, hastings, partly, as, a, penance, for, the, deaths, in, the, battle, and, partly, as, a, memorial, to, the, dead, at, an, ecclesiastical, council, held, in, lillebonne, in, 1080, he, was, confirmed, in, his, ultimate, authority, over, the, norman, church, although, sweyn, had, promised, to, leave, england, he, returned, in, early, 1070, raiding, along, the, humber, and, east, anglia, toward, the, isle, of, ely, where, he, joined, up, with, hereward, the, wake, a, local, thegn, hereward, s, forces, captured, and, looted, peterborough, abbey, william, was, able, to, secure, the, departure, of, sweyn, and, his, fleet, in, 1070, allowing, him, to, return, to, the, continent, to, deal, with, troubles, in, maine, where, the, town, of, le, mans, had, revolted, in, 1069, another, concern, was, the, death, of, count, baldwin, vi, of, flanders, in, july, 1070, which, led, to, a, succession, crisis, as, his, widow, richilde, was, ruling, for, their, two, young, sons, arnulf, and, baldwin, her, rule, was, contested, by, robert, baldwin, s, brother, richilde, proposed, marriage, to, william, fitzosbern, who, was, in, normandy, and, fitzosbern, accepted, but, after, he, was, killed, in, february, 1071, at, the, battle, of, cassel, robert, became, count, he, was, opposed, to, king, william, s, power, on, the, continent, thus, the, battle, of, cassel, upset, the, balance, of, power, in, northern, france, and, cost, william, an, important, supporter, in, 1071, william, defeated, the, last, rebellion, of, the, north, earl, edwin, was, betrayed, by, his, own, men, and, killed, while, william, built, a, causeway, to, subdue, the, isle, of, ely, where, hereward, the, wake, and, morcar, were, hiding, hereward, escaped, but, morcar, was, captured, deprived, of, his, earldom, and, imprisoned, in, 1072, william, invaded, scotland, defeating, malcolm, who, had, recently, invaded, the, north, of, england, william, and, malcolm, agreed, to, peace, by, signing, the, treaty, of, abernethy, and, malcolm, probably, gave, up, his, son, duncan, as, a, hostage, for, the, peace, perhaps, another, stipulation, of, the, treaty, was, the, expulsion, of, edgar, the, theling, from, malcolm, s, court, william, then, turned, his, attention, to, the, continent, returning, to, normandy, in, early, 1073, to, deal, with, the, invasion, of, maine, by, fulk, le, rechin, the, count, of, anjou, with, a, swift, campaign, william, seized, le, mans, from, fulk, s, forces, completing, the, campaign, by, 30, march, 1073, this, made, william, s, power, more, secure, in, northern, france, but, the, new, count, of, flanders, accepted, edgar, the, theling, into, his, court, robert, also, married, his, half, sister, bertha, to, king, philip, i, of, france, who, was, opposed, to, norman, power, william, returned, to, england, to, release, his, army, from, service, in, 1073, but, quickly, returned, to, normandy, where, he, spent, all, of, 1074, he, left, england, in, the, hands, of, his, supporters, including, richard, fitzgilbert, and, william, de, warenne, as, well, as, lanfranc, william, s, ability, to, leave, england, for, an, entire, year, was, a, sign, that, he, felt, that, his, control, of, the, kingdom, was, secure, while, william, was, in, normandy, edgar, the, theling, returned, to, scotland, from, flanders, the, french, king, seeking, a, focus, for, those, opposed, to, william, s, power, proposed, that, edgar, be, given, the, castle, of, montreuil, sur, mer, on, the, channel, which, would, have, given, edgar, a, strategic, advantage, against, william, however, edgar, was, forced, to, submit, to, william, shortly, thereafter, and, he, returned, to, william, s, court, philip, although, thwarted, in, this, attempt, turned, his, attentions, to, brittany, leading, to, a, revolt, in, 1075, in, 1075, during, william, s, absence, ralph, de, gael, the, earl, of, norfolk, and, roger, de, breteuil, the, earl, of, hereford, conspired, to, overthrow, william, in, the, revolt, of, the, earls, ralph, was, at, least, part, breton, and, had, spent, most, of, his, life, prior, to, 1066, in, brittany, where, he, still, had, lands, roger, was, a, norman, son, of, william, fitzosbern, but, had, inherited, less, authority, than, his, father, held, ralph, s, authority, seems, also, to, have, been, less, than, his, predecessors, in, the, earldom, and, this, was, likely, the, cause, of, his, involvement, in, the, revolt, the, exact, reason, for, the, rebellion, is, unclear, it, was, launched, at, the, wedding, of, ralph, to, a, relative, of, roger, held, at, exning, in, suffolk, waltheof, the, earl, of, northumbria, although, one, of, william, s, favourites, was, involved, and, some, breton, lords, were, ready, to, rebel, in, support, of, ralph, and, roger, ralph, also, requested, danish, aid, william, remained, in, normandy, while, his, men, in, england, subdued, the, revolt, roger, was, unable, to, leave, his, stronghold, in, herefordshire, because, of, efforts, by, wulfstan, the, bishop, of, worcester, and, thelwig, the, abbot, of, evesham, ralph, was, bottled, up, in, norwich, castle, by, the, combined, efforts, of, odo, of, bayeux, geoffrey, de, montbray, richard, fitzgilbert, and, william, de, warenne, ralph, eventually, left, norwich, in, the, control, of, his, wife, and, left, england, ending, up, in, brittany, norwich, was, besieged, and, surrendered, with, the, garrison, allowed, to, go, to, brittany, meanwhile, the, danish, king, s, brother, cnut, had, finally, arrived, in, england, with, a, fleet, of, 200, ships, but, norwich, had, already, surrendered, the, danes, raided, along, the, coast, before, returning, home, william, returned, to, england, later, in, 1075, to, deal, with, the, danish, threat, leaving, his, wife, matilda, in, charge, of, normandy, he, celebrated, christmas, at, winchester, and, dealt, with, the, aftermath, of, the, rebellion, roger, and, waltheof, were, kept, in, prison, where, waltheof, was, executed, in, may, 1076, before, this, william, had, returned, to, the, continent, where, ralph, had, continued, the, rebellion, from, brittany, earl, ralph, had, secured, control, of, the, castle, at, dol, and, in, september, 1076, william, advanced, into, brittany, and, laid, siege, to, the, castle, king, philip, of, france, later, relieved, the, siege, and, defeated, william, at, the, battle, of, dol, in, 1076, forcing, him, to, retreat, to, normandy, although, this, was, william, s, first, defeat, in, battle, it, did, little, to, change, things, an, angevin, attack, on, maine, was, defeated, in, late, 1076, or, 1077, with, count, fulk, le, rechin, wounded, in, the, unsuccessful, attack, more, serious, was, the, retirement, of, simon, de, cr, py, the, count, of, amiens, to, a, monastery, before, he, became, a, monk, simon, handed, his, county, of, the, vexin, over, to, king, philip, the, vexin, was, a, buffer, state, between, normandy, and, the, lands, of, the, french, king, and, simon, had, been, a, supporter, of, william, william, was, able, to, make, peace, with, philip, in, 1077, and, secured, a, truce, with, count, fulk, in, late, 1077, or, early, 1078, in, late, 1077, or, early, 1078, trouble, began, between, william, and, his, eldest, son, robert, although, orderic, vitalis, describes, it, as, starting, with, a, quarrel, between, robert, and, his, younger, brothers, william, and, henry, including, a, story, that, the, quarrel, was, started, when, william, and, henry, threw, water, at, robert, it, is, much, more, likely, that, robert, was, feeling, powerless, orderic, relates, that, he, had, previously, demanded, control, of, maine, and, normandy, and, had, been, rebuffed, the, trouble, in, 1077, or, 1078, resulted, in, robert, leaving, normandy, accompanied, by, a, band, of, young, men, many, of, them, the, sons, of, william, s, supporters, included, among, them, were, robert, of, belleme, william, de, breteuil, and, roger, the, son, of, richard, fitzgilbert, this, band, went, to, the, castle, at, remalard, where, they, proceeded, to, raid, into, normandy, the, raiders, were, supported, by, many, of, william, s, continental, enemies, william, immediately, attacked, the, rebels, and, drove, them, from, remalard, but, king, philip, gave, them, the, castle, at, gerberoi, where, they, were, joined, by, new, supporters, william, then, laid, siege, to, gerberoi, in, january, 1079, after, three, weeks, the, besieged, forces, sallied, from, the, castle, and, took, the, besiegers, by, surprise, william, was, unhorsed, by, robert, and, was, only, saved, from, death, by, an, englishman, toki, son, of, wigod, who, was, himself, killed, william, s, forces, were, forced, to, lift, the, siege, and, the, king, returned, to, rouen, by, 12, april, 1080, william, and, robert, had, reached, an, accommodation, with, william, once, more, affirming, that, robert, would, receive, normandy, when, he, died, word, of, william, s, defeat, at, gerberoi, stirred, up, difficulties, in, northern, england, in, august, and, september, 1079, king, malcolm, of, scots, raided, south, of, the, river, tweed, devastating, the, land, between, the, river, tees, and, the, tweed, in, a, raid, that, lasted, almost, a, month, the, lack, of, norman, response, appears, to, have, caused, the, northumbrians, to, grow, restive, and, in, the, spring, of, 1080, they, rebelled, against, the, rule, of, walcher, the, bishop, of, durham, and, earl, of, northumbria, walcher, was, killed, on, 14, may, 1080, and, the, king, dispatched, his, half, brother, odo, to, deal, with, the, rebellion, william, departed, normandy, in, july, 1080, and, in, the, autumn, his, son, robert, was, sent, on, a, campaign, against, the, scots, robert, raided, into, lothian, and, forced, malcolm, to, agree, to, terms, building, the, new, castle, at, newcastle, upon, tyne, while, returning, to, england, the, king, was, at, gloucester, for, christmas, 1080, and, at, winchester, for, whitsun, in, 1081, ceremonially, wearing, his, crown, on, both, occasions, a, papal, embassy, arrived, in, england, during, this, period, asking, that, william, do, fealty, for, england, to, the, papacy, a, request, that, he, rejected, william, also, visited, wales, in, 1081, although, the, english, and, the, welsh, sources, differ, on, the, purpose, of, the, visit, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, states, that, it, was, a, military, campaign, but, welsh, sources, record, it, as, a, pilgrimage, to, st, davids, in, honour, of, saint, david, william, s, biographer, david, bates, argues, that, the, former, explanation, is, more, likely, the, balance, of, power, had, recently, shifted, in, wales, and, william, would, have, wished, to, take, advantage, of, this, to, extend, norman, power, by, the, end, of, 1081, william, was, back, on, the, continent, dealing, with, disturbances, in, maine, although, he, led, an, expedition, into, maine, the, result, was, instead, a, negotiated, settlement, arranged, by, a, papal, legate, sources, for, william, s, actions, between, 1082, and, 1084, are, meagre, according, to, the, historian, david, bates, this, probably, means, that, little, of, note, happened, and, that, because, william, was, on, the, continent, there, was, nothing, for, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, to, record, in, 1082, william, ordered, the, arrest, of, his, half, brother, odo, the, exact, reasons, are, unclear, as, no, contemporary, author, recorded, what, caused, the, quarrel, between, the, half, brothers, orderic, vitalis, later, recorded, that, odo, had, aspirations, to, become, pope, and, that, odo, had, attempted, to, persuade, some, of, william, s, vassals, to, join, odo, in, an, invasion, of, southern, italy, this, would, have, been, considered, tampering, with, the, king, s, authority, over, his, vassals, which, william, would, not, have, tolerated, although, odo, remained, in, confinement, for, the, rest, of, william, s, reign, his, lands, were, not, confiscated, in, 1083, william, s, son, robert, rebelled, once, more, with, support, from, the, french, king, a, further, blow, was, the, death, of, queen, matilda, on, 2, november, 1083, william, was, always, described, as, close, to, his, wife, and, her, death, would, have, added, to, his, problems, maine, continued, to, be, difficult, with, a, rebellion, by, hubert, de, beaumont, au, maine, probably, in, 1084, hubert, was, besieged, in, his, castle, at, sainte, suzanne, by, william, s, forces, for, at, least, two, years, but, he, eventually, made, peace, with, the, king, and, was, restored, to, favour, william, s, movements, during, 1084, and, 1085, are, unclear, he, was, in, normandy, at, easter, 1084, but, may, have, been, in, england, before, then, to, collect, the, danegeld, assessed, that, year, for, the, defence, of, england, against, an, invasion, by, king, cnut, iv, of, denmark, although, english, and, norman, forces, remained, on, alert, throughout, 1085, and, into, 1086, the, invasion, threat, was, ended, by, cnut, s, death, in, july, 1086, as, part, of, his, efforts, to, secure, england, william, ordered, many, castles, keeps, and, mottes, built, among, them, the, central, keep, of, the, tower, of, london, the, white, tower, these, fortifications, allowed, normans, to, retreat, into, safety, when, threatened, with, rebellion, and, allowed, garrisons, to, be, protected, while, they, occupied, the, countryside, the, early, castles, were, simple, earth, and, timber, constructions, later, replaced, with, stone, structures, at, first, most, of, the, newly, settled, normans, kept, household, knights, and, did, not, settle, their, retainers, with, fiefs, of, their, own, but, gradually, these, household, knights, came, to, be, granted, lands, of, their, own, a, process, known, as, subinfeudation, william, also, required, his, newly, created, magnates, to, contribute, fixed, quotas, of, knights, towards, not, only, military, campaigns, but, also, castle, garrisons, this, method, of, organising, the, military, forces, was, a, departure, from, the, pre, conquest, english, practice, of, basing, military, service, on, territorial, units, such, as, the, hide, by, william, s, death, after, weathering, a, series, of, rebellions, most, of, the, native, anglo, saxon, aristocracy, had, been, replaced, by, norman, and, other, continental, magnates, not, all, of, the, normans, who, accompanied, william, in, the, initial, conquest, acquired, large, amounts, of, land, in, england, some, appear, to, have, been, reluctant, to, take, up, lands, in, a, kingdom, that, did, not, always, appear, pacified, although, some, of, the, newly, rich, normans, in, england, came, from, william, s, close, family, or, from, the, upper, norman, nobility, others, were, from, relatively, humble, backgrounds, william, granted, some, lands, to, his, continental, followers, from, the, holdings, of, one, or, more, specific, englishmen, at, other, times, he, granted, a, compact, grouping, of, lands, previously, held, by, many, different, englishmen, to, one, norman, follower, often, to, allow, for, the, consolidation, of, lands, around, a, strategically, placed, castle, the, medieval, chronicler, william, of, malmesbury, says, that, the, king, also, seized, and, depopulated, many, miles, of, land, 36, parishes, turning, it, into, the, royal, new, forest, to, support, his, enthusiastic, enjoyment, of, hunting, modern, historians, have, concluded, that, the, new, forest, depopulation, was, greatly, exaggerated, most, of, the, new, forest, comprises, poor, agricultural, lands, and, archaeological, and, geographic, studies, have, shown, that, it, was, likely, sparsely, settled, when, it, was, turned, into, a, royal, forest, william, was, known, for, his, love, of, hunting, and, he, introduced, the, forest, law, into, areas, of, the, country, regulating, who, could, hunt, and, what, could, be, hunted, after, 1066, william, did, not, attempt, to, integrate, his, separate, domains, into, one, unified, realm, with, one, set, of, laws, his, seal, from, after, 1066, of, which, six, impressions, still, survive, was, made, for, him, after, he, conquered, england, and, stressed, his, role, as, king, while, separately, mentioning, his, role, as, duke, when, in, normandy, william, acknowledged, that, he, owed, fealty, to, the, french, king, but, in, england, no, such, acknowledgement, was, made, further, evidence, that, the, various, parts, of, william, s, lands, were, considered, separate, the, administrative, machinery, of, normandy, england, and, maine, continued, to, exist, separate, from, the, other, lands, with, each, one, retaining, its, own, forms, for, example, england, continued, the, use, of, writs, which, were, not, known, on, the, continent, also, the, charters, and, documents, produced, for, the, government, in, normandy, differed, in, formulas, from, those, produced, in, england, william, took, over, an, english, government, that, was, more, complex, than, the, norman, system, england, was, divided, into, shires, or, counties, which, were, further, divided, into, either, hundreds, or, wapentakes, each, shire, was, administered, by, a, royal, official, called, a, sheriff, who, roughly, had, the, same, status, as, a, norman, viscount, a, sheriff, was, responsible, for, royal, justice, and, collecting, royal, revenue, to, oversee, his, expanded, domain, william, was, forced, to, travel, even, more, than, he, had, as, duke, he, crossed, back, and, forth, between, the, continent, and, england, at, least, 19, times, between, 1067, and, his, death, william, spent, most, of, his, time, in, england, between, the, battle, of, hastings, and, 1072, after, that, he, spent, the, majority, of, his, time, in, normandy, government, was, still, centred, on, william, s, household, when, he, was, in, one, part, of, his, realms, decisions, would, be, made, for, other, parts, of, his, domains, and, transmitted, through, a, communication, system, that, made, use, of, letters, and, other, documents, william, also, appointed, deputies, who, could, make, decisions, while, he, was, absent, especially, if, the, absence, was, expected, to, be, lengthy, usually, this, was, a, member, of, william, s, close, family, frequently, his, half, brother, odo, or, his, wife, matilda, sometimes, deputies, were, appointed, to, deal, with, specific, issues, william, continued, the, collection, of, danegeld, a, land, tax, this, was, an, advantage, for, william, and, the, only, universal, tax, collected, by, western, european, rulers, during, this, period, it, was, an, annual, tax, based, on, the, value, of, landholdings, and, could, be, collected, at, differing, rates, most, years, saw, the, rate, of, two, shillings, per, hide, but, in, crises, it, could, be, increased, to, as, much, as, six, shillings, per, hide, coinage, across, his, domains, continued, to, be, minted, in, different, cycles, and, styles, english, coins, were, generally, of, high, silver, content, with, high, artistic, standards, and, were, required, to, be, re, minted, every, three, years, norman, coins, had, a, much, lower, silver, content, were, often, of, poor, artistic, quality, and, were, rarely, re, minted, in, england, no, other, coinage, was, allowed, while, on, the, continent, other, coinage, was, considered, legal, tender, nor, is, there, evidence, that, many, english, pennies, were, circulating, in, normandy, which, shows, little, attempt, to, integrate, the, monetary, systems, of, england, and, normandy, besides, taxation, william, s, large, landholdings, throughout, england, strengthened, his, rule, as, king, edward, s, heir, he, controlled, all, of, the, former, royal, lands, he, also, retained, control, of, much, of, the, lands, of, harold, and, his, family, which, made, the, king, the, largest, secular, landowner, in, england, by, a, wide, margin, at, christmas, 1085, william, ordered, the, compilation, of, a, survey, of, the, landholdings, held, by, himself, and, by, his, vassals, throughout, his, kingdom, organised, by, counties, it, resulted, in, a, work, now, known, as, the, domesday, book, the, listing, for, each, county, gives, the, holdings, of, each, landholder, grouped, by, owners, the, listings, describe, the, holding, who, owned, the, land, before, the, conquest, its, value, its, tax, assessment, and, usually, the, number, of, peasants, ploughs, and, any, other, resources, the, holding, had, towns, were, listed, separately, all, the, english, counties, south, of, the, river, tees, and, river, ribble, are, included, the, whole, work, seems, to, have, been, mostly, completed, by, 1, august, 1086, when, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, records, that, william, received, the, results, and, that, all, the, chief, magnates, swore, the, salisbury, oath, a, renewal, of, their, oaths, of, allegiance, william, s, motivation, in, ordering, the, survey, is, unclear, but, it, probably, had, several, purposes, such, as, making, a, record, of, feudal, obligations, and, justifying, increased, taxation, william, left, england, towards, the, end, of, 1086, following, his, arrival, back, on, the, continent, he, married, his, daughter, constance, to, duke, alan, of, brittany, in, furtherance, of, his, policy, of, seeking, allies, against, the, french, kings, william, s, son, robert, still, allied, with, the, french, king, appears, to, have, been, active, in, stirring, up, trouble, enough, so, that, william, led, an, expedition, against, the, french, vexin, in, july, 1087, while, seizing, mantes, william, either, fell, ill, or, was, injured, by, the, pommel, of, his, saddle, he, was, taken, to, the, priory, of, saint, gervase, at, rouen, where, he, died, on, 9, september, 1087, knowledge, of, the, events, preceding, his, death, is, confused, because, there, are, two, different, accounts, orderic, vitalis, preserves, a, lengthy, account, complete, with, speeches, made, by, many, of, the, principals, but, this, is, likely, more, of, an, account, of, how, a, king, should, die, than, of, what, actually, happened, the, other, the, de, obitu, willelmi, or, on, the, death, of, william, has, been, shown, to, be, a, copy, of, two, 9th, century, accounts, with, names, changed, william, left, normandy, to, robert, and, the, custody, of, england, was, given, to, william, s, second, surviving, son, also, called, william, on, the, assumption, that, he, would, become, king, the, youngest, son, henry, received, money, after, entrusting, england, to, his, second, son, the, elder, william, sent, the, younger, william, back, to, england, on, 7, or, 8, september, bearing, a, letter, to, lanfranc, ordering, the, archbishop, to, aid, the, new, king, other, bequests, included, gifts, to, the, church, and, money, to, be, distributed, to, the, poor, william, also, ordered, that, all, of, his, prisoners, be, released, including, his, half, brother, odo, disorder, followed, william, s, death, everyone, who, had, been, at, his, deathbed, left, the, body, at, rouen, and, hurried, off, to, attend, to, their, own, affairs, eventually, the, clergy, of, rouen, arranged, to, have, the, body, sent, to, caen, where, william, had, desired, to, be, buried, in, his, foundation, of, the, abbaye, aux, hommes, the, funeral, attended, by, the, bishops, and, abbots, of, normandy, as, well, as, his, son, henry, was, disturbed, by, a, citizen, of, caen, who, alleged, that, his, family, had, been, illegally, despoiled, of, the, land, on, which, the, church, was, built, after, hurried, consultations, the, allegation, was, shown, to, be, true, and, the, man, was, compensated, a, further, indignity, occurred, when, the, corpse, was, lowered, into, the, tomb, the, corpse, was, too, large, for, the, space, and, when, attendants, forced, the, body, into, the, tomb, it, burst, spreading, a, disgusting, odour, throughout, the, church, william, s, grave, is, marked, by, a, marble, slab, with, a, latin, inscription, dating, from, the, early, 19th, century, the, tomb, has, been, disturbed, several, times, since, 1087, the, first, time, in, 1522, when, the, grave, was, opened, on, orders, from, the, papacy, the, intact, body, was, restored, to, the, tomb, at, that, time, but, in, 1562, during, the, french, wars, of, religion, the, grave, was, reopened, and, the, bones, scattered, and, lost, with, the, exception, of, one, thigh, bone, this, lone, relic, was, reburied, in, 1642, with, a, new, marker, which, was, replaced, 100, years, later, with, a, more, elaborate, monument, this, tomb, was, again, destroyed, during, the, french, revolution, but, was, eventually, replaced, with, the, current, ledger, stone, the, immediate, consequence, of, william, s, death, was, a, war, between, his, sons, robert, and, william, over, control, of, england, and, normandy, even, after, the, younger, william, s, death, in, 1100, and, the, succession, of, his, youngest, brother, henry, as, king, normandy, and, england, remained, contested, between, the, brothers, until, robert, s, capture, by, henry, at, the, battle, of, tinchebray, in, 1106, the, difficulties, over, the, succession, led, to, a, loss, of, authority, in, normandy, with, the, aristocracy, regaining, much, of, the, power, they, had, lost, to, the, elder, william, his, sons, also, lost, much, of, their, control, over, maine, which, revolted, in, 1089, and, managed, to, remain, mostly, free, of, norman, influence, thereafter, the, impact, on, england, of, william, s, conquest, was, profound, changes, in, the, church, aristocracy, culture, and, language, of, the, country, have, persisted, into, modern, times, the, conquest, brought, the, kingdom, into, closer, contact, with, france, and, forged, ties, that, lasted, throughout, the, middle, ages, another, consequence, of, william, s, invasion, was, the, sundering, of, the, formerly, close, ties, between, england, and, scandinavia, william, s, government, blended, elements, of, the, english, and, norman, systems, into, a, new, one, that, laid, the, foundations, of, the, later, medieval, english, kingdom, how, abrupt, and, far, reaching, the, changes, were, is, still, a, matter, of, debate, among, historians, with, some, such, as, richard, southern, claiming, that, the, conquest, was, the, single, most, radical, change, in, european, history, between, the, fall, of, rome, and, the, 20th, century, others, such, as, h, g, richardson, and, g, o, sayles, see, the, changes, as, much, less, radical, the, historian, eleanor, searle, describes, william, s, invasion, as, a, plan, that, no, ruler, but, a, scandinavian, would, have, considered, william, s, reign, has, caused, historical, controversy, since, before, his, death, william, of, poitiers, wrote, glowingly, of, william, s, reign, and, its, benefits, but, the, obituary, notice, for, william, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, condemns, william, in, harsh, terms, during, the, reign, of, queen, elizabeth, i, archbishop, matthew, parker, saw, the, conquest, as, having, corrupted, a, purer, english, church, which, parker, attempted, to, restore, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, some, historians, and, lawyers, saw, william, s, reign, as, imposing, a, norman, yoke, on, the, native, anglo, saxons, an, argument, that, continued, during, the, 19th, century, with, further, elaborations, along, nationalistic, lines, these, controversies, have, led, to, william, being, seen, by, some, historians, either, as, one, of, the, creators, of, england, s, greatness, or, as, inflicting, one, of, the, greatest, defeats, in, english, history, others, have, viewed, him, as, an, enemy, of, the, english, constitution, or, alternatively, as, its, creator, william, and, his, wife, matilda, had, at, least, nine, children, the, birth, order, of, the, sons, is, clear, but, no, source, gives, the, relative, order, of, birth, of, the, daughters, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, illegitimate, children, born, to, william
