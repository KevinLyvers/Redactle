justus, freiherr, von, liebig, 12, may, 1803, 20, april, 1873, was, a, german, scientist, who, made, major, contributions, to, the, theory, practice, and, pedagogy, of, chemistry, as, well, as, to, agricultural, and, biological, chemistry, he, is, considered, one, of, the, principal, founders, of, organic, chemistry, as, a, professor, at, the, university, of, giessen, he, devised, the, modern, laboratory, oriented, teaching, method, and, for, such, innovations, he, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, outstanding, chemistry, teachers, of, all, time, he, has, been, described, as, the, father, of, the, fertilizer, industry, for, his, emphasis, on, nitrogen, and, minerals, as, essential, plant, nutrients, and, his, popularization, of, the, law, of, the, minimum, which, states, that, plant, growth, is, limited, by, the, scarcest, nutrient, resource, rather, than, the, total, amount, of, resources, available, he, also, developed, a, manufacturing, process, for, beef, extracts, and, with, his, consent, a, company, called, liebig, extract, of, meat, company, was, founded, to, exploit, the, concept, it, later, introduced, the, oxo, brand, beef, bouillon, cube, he, popularized, an, earlier, invention, for, condensing, vapors, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, liebig, condenser, justus, liebig, was, born, in, darmstadt, into, the, middle, class, family, of, johann, georg, liebig, and, maria, caroline, m, ser, in, early, may, 1803, 1, 3, his, father, was, a, drysalter, and, hardware, merchant, who, compounded, and, sold, paints, varnishes, and, pigments, which, he, developed, in, his, own, workshop, 1, from, childhood, justus, was, fascinated, with, chemistry, at, the, age, of, 13, liebig, lived, through, the, year, without, a, summer, when, the, majority, of, food, crops, in, the, northern, hemisphere, were, destroyed, by, a, volcanic, winter, germany, was, among, the, hardest, hit, nations, in, the, global, famine, that, ensued, and, the, experience, is, said, to, have, shaped, liebig, s, later, work, due, in, part, to, liebig, s, innovations, in, fertilizers, and, agriculture, the, 1816, famine, became, known, as, the, last, great, subsistence, crisis, in, the, western, world, liebig, attended, grammar, school, at, the, ludwig, georgs, gymnasium, in, darmstadt, from, the, ages, of, 8, to, 14, 5, 7, leaving, without, a, certificate, of, completion, he, was, apprenticed, for, several, months, to, the, apothecary, gottfried, pirsch, 1792, 1870, in, heppenheim, before, returning, home, possibly, because, his, father, could, not, afford, to, pay, his, indentures, a, legal, contract, that, reflects, or, covers, a, debt, or, purchase, obligation, he, worked, with, his, father, for, the, next, two, years, 7, 8, then, attended, the, university, of, bonn, studying, under, karl, wilhelm, gottlob, kastner, his, father, s, business, associate, when, kastner, moved, to, the, university, of, erlangen, liebig, followed, him, 13, liebig, left, erlangen, in, march, 1822, in, part, because, of, his, involvement, with, the, radical, korps, rhenania, a, nationalist, student, organization, but, also, because, of, his, hopes, for, more, advanced, chemical, studies, the, circumstances, are, clouded, by, possible, scandal, 19, 28, some, scholars, argue, that, he, fled, to, paris, because, of, his, involvement, in, radical, student, groups, in, late, october, 1822, liebig, went, to, paris, to, study, on, a, grant, obtained, for, him, by, kastner, from, the, hessian, government, he, worked, in, the, private, laboratory, of, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, and, was, also, befriended, by, alexander, von, humboldt, and, georges, cuvier, 1769, 1832, liebig, s, doctorate, from, erlangen, was, conferred, on, 23, june, 1823, a, considerable, time, after, he, left, as, a, result, of, kastner, s, intervention, on, his, behalf, kastner, pleaded, that, the, requirement, of, a, dissertation, be, waived, and, the, degree, granted, in, absentia, 33, 34, liebig, left, paris, to, return, to, darmstadt, in, april, 1824, on, 26, may, 1824, at, the, age, of, 21, and, with, humboldt, s, recommendation, liebig, became, a, professor, extraordinarius, at, the, university, of, giessen, 35, liebig, s, appointment, was, part, of, an, attempt, to, modernize, the, university, of, giessen, and, attract, more, students, he, received, a, small, stipend, without, laboratory, funding, or, access, to, facilities, 38, 41, his, situation, was, complicated, by, the, presence, of, existing, faculty, professor, wilhelm, zimmermann, 1780, 1825, taught, general, chemistry, as, part, of, the, philosophy, faculty, leaving, medical, chemistry, and, pharmacy, to, professor, philipp, vogt, in, the, medical, faculty, vogt, was, happy, to, support, a, reorganization, in, which, pharmacy, was, taught, by, liebig, and, became, the, responsibility, of, the, faculty, of, arts, rather, than, the, faculty, of, medicine, zimmermann, found, himself, competing, unsuccessfully, with, liebig, for, students, and, their, lecture, fees, he, refused, to, allow, liebig, to, use, existing, space, and, equipment, and, finally, committed, suicide, on, 19, july, 1825, the, deaths, of, zimmermann, and, professor, blumhof, who, taught, technology, and, mining, opened, the, way, for, liebig, to, apply, for, a, full, professorship, liebig, was, appointed, to, the, ordentlicher, chair, in, chemistry, on, 7, december, 1825, receiving, a, considerably, increased, salary, and, a, laboratory, allowance, 38, 41, liebig, married, henriette, jettchen, moldenhauer, 1807, 1881, the, daughter, of, a, state, official, in, may, 1826, they, had, five, children, georg, 1827, 1903, agnes, 1828, 1862, hermann, 1831, 1894, johanna, 1836, 1925, and, marie, 1845, 1920, although, liebig, was, lutheran, and, jettchen, catholic, their, differences, in, religion, appear, to, have, been, resolved, amicably, by, bringing, their, sons, up, in, the, lutheran, faith, and, their, daughters, as, catholics, 44, liebig, and, several, associates, proposed, to, create, an, institute, for, pharmacy, and, manufacturing, within, the, university, 42, the, senate, however, uncompromisingly, rejected, their, idea, stating, that, training, apothecaries, soapmakers, beer, brewers, dyers, and, vinegar, distillers, was, not, the, university, s, task, 43, as, of, 17, december, 1825, they, ruled, that, any, such, institution, would, have, to, be, a, private, venture, this, decision, worked, to, liebig, s, advantage, as, an, independent, venture, he, could, ignore, university, rules, and, accept, matriculated, and, unmatriculated, students, 42, 43, liebig, s, institute, was, widely, advertised, in, pharmaceutical, journals, and, opened, in, 1826, 44, 45, its, classes, in, practical, chemistry, and, laboratory, procedures, for, chemical, analysis, were, taught, in, addition, to, liebig, s, formal, courses, at, the, university, from, 1825, to, 1835, the, laboratory, was, housed, in, the, guardroom, of, a, disused, barracks, on, the, edge, of, town, the, main, laboratory, space, was, about, 38, m, 2, 410, sq, ft, in, size, and, included, a, small, lecture, room, a, storage, closet, and, a, main, room, with, ovens, and, work, tables, an, open, colonnade, outside, could, be, used, for, dangerous, reactions, liebig, could, work, there, with, eight, or, nine, students, at, a, time, he, lived, in, a, cramped, apartment, with, his, wife, and, children, on, the, floor, above, 47, liebig, was, one, of, the, first, chemists, to, organize, a, laboratory, in, its, present, form, engaging, with, students, in, empirical, research, on, a, large, scale, through, a, combination, of, research, and, teaching, his, methods, of, organic, analysis, enabled, him, to, direct, the, analytical, work, of, many, graduate, students, liebig, s, students, were, from, many, of, the, german, states, as, well, as, britain, and, the, united, states, they, helped, create, an, international, reputation, for, their, doktorvater, his, laboratory, became, renowned, as, a, model, institution, for, the, teaching, of, practical, chemistry, 47, it, was, also, significant, for, its, emphasis, on, applying, discoveries, in, fundamental, research, to, the, development, of, specific, chemical, processes, and, products, in, 1833, liebig, convinced, chancellor, justin, von, linde, to, include, the, institute, within, the, university, 47, in, 1839, he, obtained, government, funds, to, build, a, lecture, theatre, and, two, separate, laboratories, designed, by, architect, paul, hofmann, the, new, chemistry, laboratory, featured, innovative, glass, fronted, fume, cupboards, and, venting, chimneys, 58, by, 1852, when, he, left, giessen, for, munich, more, than, 700, students, of, chemistry, and, pharmacy, had, studied, with, liebig, 57, a, significant, challenge, facing, 19th, century, organic, chemists, was, the, lack, of, instruments, and, methods, of, analysis, to, support, accurate, replicable, analyses, of, organic, materials, many, chemists, worked, on, the, problem, of, organic, analysis, including, french, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, and, swedish, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, before, liebig, developed, his, version, of, an, apparatus, for, determining, the, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, content, of, organic, substances, in, 1830, it, involved, an, array, of, five, glass, bulbs, called, a, kaliapparat, to, trap, the, oxidation, product, of, the, carbon, in, the, sample, following, its, combustion, before, reaching, the, kaliapparat, the, combustion, gases, were, conducted, through, a, tube, containing, hygroscopic, calcium, chloride, which, absorbed, and, retained, the, oxidation, product, of, the, hydrogen, of, the, sample, namely, water, vapor, next, in, the, kaliapparat, carbon, dioxide, was, absorbed, in, a, potassium, hydroxide, solution, in, the, three, lower, bulbs, and, used, to, measure, the, weight, of, carbon, in, the, sample, for, any, substance, consisting, only, of, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, the, percentage, of, oxygen, was, found, by, subtracting, the, carbon, and, hydrogen, percentages, from, 100, the, remainder, must, be, the, percentage, of, oxygen, a, charcoal, furnace, a, sheet, steel, tray, in, which, the, combustion, tube, was, laid, was, used, for, the, combustion, weighing, carbon, and, hydrogen, directly, rather, than, estimating, them, volumetrically, significantly, increased, the, method, s, accuracy, of, measurement, 48, 51, liebig, s, assistant, carl, ettling, perfected, glass, blowing, techniques, for, producing, the, kaliapparat, and, demonstrated, them, to, visitors, 50, liebig, s, kaliapparat, simplified, the, method, of, quantitative, organic, analysis, and, rendered, it, routine, brock, suggests, that, the, availability, of, a, superior, technical, apparatus, was, one, reason, why, liebig, was, able, to, attract, so, many, students, to, his, laboratory, 50, his, method, of, combustion, analysis, was, used, pharmaceutically, and, certainly, made, possible, many, contributions, to, organic, agricultural, and, biological, chemistry, 76, 77, liebig, also, popularized, the, use, of, a, counter, current, water, cooling, system, for, distillation, still, referred, to, as, a, liebig, condenser, 84, liebig, himself, attributed, the, vapor, condensation, device, to, german, pharmacist, johann, friedrich, august, gottling, who, had, made, improvements, in, 1794, to, a, design, discovered, independently, by, german, chemist, christian, ehrenfried, weigel, in, 1771, by, french, scientist, p, j, poisonnier, in, 1779, and, by, finnish, chemist, johan, gadolin, in, 1791, although, it, was, not, widely, adopted, until, after, liebig, s, death, when, safety, legislation, finally, prohibited, the, use, of, mercury, in, making, mirrors, liebig, proposed, a, process, for, silvering, that, eventually, became, the, basis, of, modern, mirror, making, in, 1835, he, reported, that, aldehydes, reduce, silver, salts, to, metallic, silver, after, working, with, other, scientists, carl, august, von, steinheil, approached, liebig, in, 1856, to, see, if, he, could, develop, a, silvering, technique, capable, of, producing, high, quality, optical, mirrors, for, use, in, reflecting, telescopes, liebig, developed, blemish, free, mirrors, by, adding, copper, to, ammoniated, silver, nitrate, and, sugar, an, attempt, to, commercialize, the, process, and, drive, out, mercury, mirror, making, and, its, injurious, influence, on, workers, health, was, unsuccessful, 136, 139, liebig, s, mirrors, struggled, commercially, due, to, poor, glass, which, produced, an, off, color, greenish, yellow, reflection, rudely, liebig, commented, that, frenchwomen, especially, hated, his, mirrors, because, frenchwomen, already, looked, yellow, and, sickly, and, the, mirrors, just, reminded, them, how, ugly, they, were, one, of, liebig, s, frequent, collaborators, was, friedrich, w, hler, they, met, in, 1826, in, frankfurt, after, independently, reporting, on, the, preparation, of, two, substances, cyanic, acid, and, fulminic, acid, that, apparently, had, the, same, composition, but, very, different, characteristics, the, silver, fulminate, investigated, by, liebig, was, explosive, whereas, the, silver, cyanate, found, by, w, hler, was, not, after, reviewing, the, disputed, analyses, together, they, agreed, that, both, were, valid, the, discovery, of, these, and, other, substances, led, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, to, suggest, the, idea, of, isomers, substances, that, are, defined, not, simply, by, the, number, and, kind, of, atoms, in, the, molecule, but, also, by, the, arrangement, of, those, atoms, 72, in, 1832, liebig, and, friedrich, w, hler, published, an, investigation, of, the, oil, of, bitter, almonds, they, transformed, pure, oil, into, several, halogenated, compounds, which, were, further, transformed, in, other, reactions, throughout, these, transformations, a, single, compound, which, they, named, benzoyl, preserves, its, nature, and, composition, unchanged, in, nearly, all, its, associations, with, other, bodies, 79, their, experiments, proved, that, a, group, of, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, atoms, could, behave, like, an, element, take, the, place, of, an, element, and, can, be, exchanged, for, elements, in, chemical, compounds, this, laid, the, foundation, for, the, doctrine, of, compound, radicals, which, can, be, seen, as, an, early, step, in, the, development, of, structural, chemistry, the, 1830s, were, a, period, of, intense, investigation, of, organic, compounds, by, liebig, and, his, students, and, of, vigorous, debate, about, the, theoretical, implications, of, their, results, liebig, published, on, a, wide, variety, of, topics, personally, averaging, 30, papers, per, year, between, 1830, and, 1840, 76, liebig, not, only, isolated, individual, substances, but, also, studied, their, interrelationships, and, the, ways, in, which, they, degraded, and, metamorphosed, into, other, substances, looking, for, clues, to, the, understanding, of, both, chemical, composition, and, physiological, function, other, significant, contributions, by, liebig, during, this, time, include, his, examination, of, the, nitrogen, content, of, bases, 77, the, study, of, chlorination, and, the, isolation, of, chloral, 1832, 83, the, identification, of, the, ethyl, radical, 1834, 82, the, oxidation, of, alcohol, and, formation, of, aldehyde, 1835, 84, the, polybasic, theory, of, organic, acids, 1838, 86, 87, and, the, degradation, of, urea, 1837, 88, 89, writing, about, the, analysis, of, urine, a, complex, organic, product, he, made, a, declaration, that, reveals, both, the, changes, that, were, occurring, in, chemistry, over, a, short, time, and, the, impact, of, his, own, work, 89, at, a, time, when, many, chemists, such, as, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, still, insisted, on, a, hard, and, fast, separation, between, the, organic, and, inorganic, liebig, asserted, the, production, of, all, organic, substances, no, longer, belongs, just, to, living, organisms, it, must, be, seen, as, not, only, probable, but, as, certain, that, we, shall, be, able, to, produce, them, in, our, laboratories, sugar, salicin, and, morphine, will, be, artificially, produced, of, course, we, do, not, yet, know, how, to, do, this, because, we, do, not, yet, know, the, precursors, from, which, these, compounds, arise, but, we, shall, come, to, know, them, liebig, s, arguments, against, any, chemical, distinction, between, living, physiological, and, dead, chemical, processes, proved, a, great, inspiration, to, several, of, his, students, and, others, who, were, interested, in, materialism, though, liebig, distanced, himself, from, the, direct, political, implications, of, materialism, he, tacitly, supported, the, work, of, carl, vogt, 1817, 1895, jacob, moleschott, 1822, 1893, and, ludwig, b, chner, 1824, 1899, by, the, 1840s, liebig, was, attempting, to, apply, theoretical, knowledge, from, organic, chemistry, to, real, world, problems, of, food, availability, his, book, die, organische, chemie, in, ihrer, anwendung, auf, agricultur, und, physiologie, organic, chemistry, in, its, application, to, agriculture, and, physiology, 1840, promoted, the, idea, that, chemistry, could, revolutionize, agricultural, practice, increasing, yields, and, lowering, costs, it, was, widely, translated, vociferously, critiqued, and, highly, influential, liebig, s, book, discussed, chemical, transformations, within, living, systems, both, plant, and, animal, outlining, a, theoretical, approach, to, agricultural, chemistry, the, book, s, first, part, focused, on, plant, nutrition, the, second, was, on, chemical, mechanisms, of, putrefaction, and, decay, 148, liebig, s, awareness, of, both, synthesis, and, degradation, led, him, to, become, an, early, advocate, of, conservation, promoting, ideas, such, as, the, recycling, of, sewage, 250, 270, liebig, argued, against, prevalent, theories, about, role, of, humus, in, plant, nutrition, which, held, that, decayed, plant, matter, was, the, primary, source, of, carbon, for, plant, nutrition, fertilizers, were, believed, to, act, by, breaking, down, humus, making, it, easier, for, plants, to, absorb, associated, with, such, ideas, was, the, belief, that, some, sort, of, vital, force, distinguished, reactions, involving, organic, as, opposed, to, inorganic, materials, early, studies, of, photosynthesis, had, identified, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and, nitrogen, as, important, but, disagreed, over, their, sources, and, mechanisms, of, action, carbon, dioxide, was, known, to, be, taken, in, and, oxygen, released, during, photosynthesis, but, researchers, suggested, that, oxygen, was, obtained, from, carbon, dioxide, rather, than, from, water, hydrogen, was, believed, to, come, primarily, from, water, researchers, disagreed, about, whether, sources, of, carbon, and, nitrogen, were, atmospheric, or, soil, based, xv, xxi, nicolas, th, odore, de, saussure, s, experiments, reported, in, recherches, chimiques, sur, la, v, g, tation, 1804, suggested, that, carbon, was, obtained, from, atmospheric, rather, than, soil, based, sources, it, also, indicated, that, water, was, a, likely, source, of, hydrogen, he, also, studied, the, absorption, of, minerals, by, plants, and, observed, that, mineral, concentrations, in, plants, tended, to, reflect, their, presence, in, the, soil, in, which, the, plants, were, grown, however, the, implications, of, de, saussure, s, results, for, theories, of, plant, nutrition, were, neither, clearly, discussed, nor, easily, understood, xxii, xxvii, liebig, reaffirmed, the, importance, of, de, saussures, findings, and, used, them, to, critique, humus, theories, while, regretting, the, limitations, of, de, saussure, s, experimental, techniques, using, more, precise, methods, of, measurement, as, a, basis, for, estimation, he, pointed, out, contradictions, such, as, the, inability, of, existing, soil, humus, to, provide, enough, carbon, to, support, the, plants, growing, in, it, xxix, by, the, late, 1830s, researchers, such, as, karl, sprengel, were, using, liebig, s, methods, of, combustion, analysis, to, assess, manures, concluding, that, their, value, could, be, attributed, to, their, constituent, minerals, 106, liebig, synthesized, ideas, about, the, mineral, theory, of, plant, nutrition, and, added, his, own, conviction, that, inorganic, materials, could, provide, nutrients, as, effectively, as, organic, sources, 148, in, his, theory, of, mineral, nutrients, liebig, identified, the, chemical, elements, of, nitrogen, n, phosphorus, p, and, potassium, k, as, essential, to, plant, growth, he, reported, that, plants, acquire, carbon, c, and, hydrogen, h, from, the, atmosphere, and, from, water, h, 2, o, in, addition, to, emphasizing, the, importance, of, minerals, in, the, soil, he, argued, that, plants, feed, on, nitrogen, compounds, derived, from, the, air, this, assertion, was, a, source, of, contention, for, many, years, and, turned, out, to, be, true, for, legumes, but, not, for, other, plants, 181, liebig, also, popularized, carl, sprengel, s, theorem, of, minimum, known, as, the, law, of, the, minimum, stating, that, plant, growth, is, not, determined, by, the, total, resources, available, but, by, the, scarcest, available, resource, a, plant, s, development, is, limited, by, the, one, essential, mineral, that, is, in, the, relatively, shortest, supply, this, concept, of, limitation, can, be, visualized, as, liebig, s, barrel, a, metaphorical, barrel, in, which, each, stave, represents, a, different, element, a, nutrient, stave, that, is, shorter, than, the, others, will, cause, the, liquid, contained, in, the, barrel, to, spill, out, at, that, level, this, is, a, qualitative, version, of, the, principles, used, for, determining, the, application, of, fertilizer, in, modern, agriculture, organic, chemistry, was, not, intended, as, a, guide, to, practical, agriculture, liebig, s, lack, of, experience, in, practical, applications, and, differences, between, editions, of, the, book, fueled, considerable, criticism, nonetheless, liebig, s, writings, had, a, profound, impact, on, agriculture, spurring, experiment, and, theoretical, debate, in, germany, england, and, france, 165, one, of, his, most, recognized, accomplishments, is, the, development, of, nitrogen, based, fertilizer, in, the, first, two, editions, of, his, book, 1840, 1842, liebig, reported, that, the, atmosphere, contained, insufficient, nitrogen, and, argued, that, nitrogen, based, fertilizer, was, needed, to, grow, the, healthiest, possible, crops, 120, liebig, believed, that, nitrogen, could, be, supplied, in, the, form, of, ammonia, and, recognized, the, possibility, of, substituting, chemical, fertilizers, for, natural, ones, animal, dung, etc, he, later, became, convinced, that, nitrogen, was, sufficiently, supplied, by, precipitation, of, ammonia, from, the, atmosphere, and, argued, vehemently, against, the, use, of, nitrogen, based, fertilizers, for, many, years, an, early, commercial, attempt, to, produce, his, own, fertilizers, was, unsuccessful, due, to, lack, of, nitrogen, in, the, mixtures, 121, 124, when, tested, in, a, farmer, s, field, liebig, s, manure, was, found, to, have, no, appreciable, effect, liebig, s, difficulties, in, reconciling, theory, and, practice, reflected, that, the, real, world, of, agriculture, was, more, complex, than, was, at, first, realized, by, the, publication, of, the, seventh, german, edition, of, agricultural, chemistry, he, had, moderated, some, of, his, views, admitting, some, mistakes, and, returning, to, the, position, that, nitrogen, based, fertilizers, were, beneficial, or, even, necessary, 179, he, was, instrumental, in, the, use, of, guano, for, nitrogen, in, 1863, he, published, the, book, es, ist, ja, die, spitze, meines, lebens, in, which, he, revised, his, early, perceptions, now, appreciating, soil, life, and, in, particular, the, biological, n, fixation, nitrogen, fertilizers, are, now, widely, used, throughout, the, world, and, their, production, is, a, substantial, segment, of, the, chemical, industry, liebig, s, work, on, applying, chemistry, to, plant, and, animal, physiology, was, especially, influential, by, 1842, he, had, published, chimie, organique, appliqu, e, la, physiologie, animale, et, la, pathologie, published, in, english, as, animal, chemistry, or, organic, chemistry, in, its, applications, to, physiology, and, pathology, presenting, a, chemical, theory, of, metabolism, 185, the, experimental, techniques, used, by, liebig, and, others, often, involved, controlling, and, measuring, diet, and, monitoring, and, analyzing, the, products, of, animal, metabolism, as, indicators, of, internal, metabolic, processes, liebig, saw, similarities, between, plant, and, animal, metabolism, and, suggested, that, nitrogenous, animal, matter, was, similar, to, and, derived, from, plant, matter, he, categorized, foodstuffs, into, two, groups, nitrogenous, materials, which, he, believed, were, used, to, build, animal, tissue, and, non, nitrogenous, materials, which, he, believed, were, involved, in, separate, processes, of, respiration, and, generation, of, heat, 184, french, researchers, such, as, jean, baptiste, dumas, and, jean, baptiste, boussingault, believed, that, animals, assimilated, sugars, proteins, and, fats, from, plant, materials, and, that, animals, could, not, synthesize, complex, molecules, liebig, s, work, suggested, a, common, ability, of, plants, and, animals, to, synthesize, complex, molecules, from, simpler, ones, his, experiments, on, fat, metabolism, convinced, him, that, animals, must, be, able, to, synthesize, fats, from, sugars, and, starches, 187, other, researchers, built, upon, his, work, confirming, the, abilities, of, animals, to, synthesize, sugar, and, build, fat, 189, 190, liebig, also, studied, respiration, at, one, point, measuring, the, ingesta, and, excreta, of, 855, soldiers, a, bodyguard, of, the, grand, duke, of, hessen, darmstadt, for, an, entire, month, 191, he, outlined, an, extremely, speculative, model, of, equations, in, which, he, attempted, to, explain, how, protein, degradation, might, balance, within, a, healthy, body, and, result, in, pathological, imbalances, in, cases, of, illness, or, inappropriate, nutrition, 191, 193, this, proposed, model, was, justifiably, criticized, berzelius, stingingly, stated, that, this, facile, kind, of, physiological, chemistry, is, created, at, the, writing, table, 194, some, of, the, ideas, that, liebig, had, enthusiastically, incorporated, were, not, supported, by, further, research, the, third, and, last, edition, of, animal, chemistry, 1846, was, substantially, revised, and, did, not, include, the, equations, 195, 197, the, third, area, discussed, in, animal, chemistry, was, fermentation, and, putrefaction, liebig, proposed, chemical, explanations, for, processes, such, as, eremacausis, organic, decomposition, describing, the, rearrangement, of, atoms, as, a, result, of, unstable, affinities, reacting, to, external, causes, such, as, air, or, already, decaying, substances, 205, liebig, identified, the, blood, as, the, site, of, the, body, s, chemical, factory, where, he, believed, processes, of, synthesis, and, degradation, took, place, he, presented, a, view, of, disease, in, terms, of, chemical, process, in, which, healthy, blood, could, be, attacked, by, external, contagia, secreting, organs, sought, to, transform, and, excrete, such, substances, and, failure, to, do, so, could, lead, to, their, elimination, through, the, skin, lungs, and, other, organs, potentially, spreading, contagion, again, although, the, world, was, much, more, complicated, than, his, theory, and, many, of, his, individual, ideas, were, later, proved, wrong, liebig, managed, to, synthesize, existing, knowledge, in, a, way, that, had, significant, implications, for, doctors, sanitarians, and, social, reformers, the, english, medical, journal, the, lancet, reviewed, liebig, s, work, and, translated, his, chemical, lectures, as, part, of, its, mission, to, establish, a, new, era, of, medicine, 207, liebig, s, ideas, stimulated, significant, medical, research, led, to, the, development, of, better, techniques, for, testing, experimental, models, of, metabolism, and, pointed, to, chemistry, as, fundamental, to, the, understanding, of, health, and, disease, 214, in, 1850, liebig, investigated, spontaneous, human, combustion, dismissing, the, simplistic, explanations, based, on, ethanol, due, to, alcoholism, liebig, drew, upon, his, work, in, plant, nutrition, and, plant, and, animal, metabolism, to, develop, a, theory, of, nutrition, which, had, significant, implications, for, cookery, in, his, researches, on, the, chemistry, of, food, 1847, liebig, argued, that, eating, not, only, meat, fibre, but, also, meat, juices, which, contained, various, inorganic, chemicals, was, important, these, vital, ingredients, would, be, lost, during, conventional, boiling, or, roasting, in, which, cooking, liquids, were, discarded, for, optimum, nutritional, quality, liebig, advised, that, cooks, should, either, sear, the, meat, initially, to, retain, fluids, or, retain, and, use, cooking, liquids, as, in, soups, or, stews, 217, 218, liebig, was, acclaimed, in, the, lancet, for, revealing, the, true, principles, of, cookery, and, physicians, promoted, rational, diets, based, on, his, ideas, well, known, british, cookery, writer, eliza, acton, responded, to, liebig, by, modifying, the, cookery, techniques, in, the, third, edition, of, her, modern, cookery, for, private, families, and, subtitling, the, edition, accordingly, 218, 219, liebig, s, idea, that, searing, meat, seals, in, the, juices, though, still, widely, believed, is, not, true, building, on, his, theories, of, the, nutritional, value, of, meat, fluids, and, seeking, an, inexpensive, nutrition, source, for, europe, s, poor, liebig, developed, a, formula, for, producing, beef, extract, the, details, were, published, in, 1847, so, that, the, benefit, of, it, should, be, placed, at, the, command, of, as, large, a, number, of, persons, as, possible, by, the, extension, of, the, manufacture, and, consequently, a, reduction, in, the, cost, production, was, not, economically, feasible, in, europe, where, meat, was, expensive, but, in, uruguay, and, new, south, wales, meat, was, an, inexpensive, byproduct, of, the, leather, industry, in, 1865, liebig, partnered, with, belgian, engineer, george, christian, giebert, and, was, named, scientific, director, of, liebig, s, extract, of, meat, company, located, in, fray, bentos, in, uruguay, other, companies, also, attempted, to, market, meat, extracts, under, the, name, liebig, s, extract, of, meat, in, britain, a, competitor, s, right, to, use, the, name, was, successfully, defended, on, the, grounds, that, the, name, had, fallen, into, general, use, and, become, a, generic, term, before, the, creation, of, any, particular, company, the, judge, asserted, that, purchasers, must, use, their, eyes, and, considered, the, presentation, of, the, products, to, be, sufficiently, different, to, enable, the, discriminating, consumer, to, determine, which, of, the, products, bore, liebig, s, signature, and, was, supported, by, liebig, himself, liebig, s, company, initially, promoted, their, meat, tea, for, its, curative, powers, and, nutritional, value, as, a, cheap, nutritious, alternative, to, real, meat, but, such, claims, did, not, hold, up, to, scrutiny, in, 1868, the, german, physiologist, edward, kemmerich, ran, an, experiment, involving, feeding, the, extract, to, a, number, of, dogs, every, one, of, the, dogs, died, after, claims, of, its, nutritional, value, were, questioned, the, company, emphasized, its, convenience, and, flavor, marketing, it, as, a, comfort, food, the, liebig, company, worked, with, popular, cookery, writers, in, various, countries, to, popularize, their, products, german, cookery, writer, henriette, davidis, wrote, recipes, for, improved, and, economic, cookery, and, other, cookbooks, katharina, prato, wrote, an, austro, hungarian, recipe, book, die, praktische, verwerthung, kochrecepte, 1879, hannah, m, young, was, commissioned, in, england, to, write, practical, cookery, book, for, the, liebig, company, in, the, united, states, maria, parloa, extolled, the, benefits, of, liebig, s, extract, colorful, calendars, and, trading, cards, were, also, marketed, to, popularize, the, product, 234, 237, the, company, also, worked, with, british, chemist, henry, enfield, roscoe, to, develop, a, related, product, which, it, registered, some, years, after, liebig, s, death, under, the, oxo, trademark, oxo, was, trademarked, worldwide, in, 1899, and, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1900, originally, a, liquid, oxo, was, released, in, cubed, solid, form, in, 1911, 230, liebig, studied, other, foods, as, well, he, promoted, the, use, of, baking, powder, to, make, lighter, bread, studied, the, chemistry, of, coffee, making, and, oatmeal, 238, 248, he, is, considered, to, have, made, possible, the, invention, of, marmite, because, of, his, discovery, that, yeast, could, be, concentrated, to, form, yeast, extract, infant, formula, liebig, produced, some, of, the, world, s, first, infant, formula, a, breast, milk, substitute, for, babies, who, could, not, breast, feed, however, the, product, proved, controversial, even, though, liebig, did, not, make, any, royalties, off, it, liebig, first, came, up, with, the, idea, based, on, the, struggles, of, his, favorite, daughter, johanna, who, struggled, to, breastfeed, her, daughter, carolina, who, was, born, in, 1864, johanna, did, not, want, to, seek, a, wet, nurse, a, common, but, controversial, practice, at, the, time, carolina, according, to, liebig, thrived, on, the, formula, but, other, scientists, were, skeptical, one, of, them, a, french, doctor, in, paris, named, jean, anne, henri, depaul, decided, to, test, his, formula, on, four, infants, whose, mothers, could, not, suckle, liebig, himself, prepared, the, first, batches, of, formula, depaul, first, gave, it, to, a, set, of, twins, who, were, born, somewhat, premature, and, weighed, 2, 24, kilograms, 4, 93, pounds, and, 2, 64, kg, 5, 82, lbs, both, died, within, two, days, depaul, tried, it, on, a, third, baby, born, full, term, at, 3, 37, kg, 7, 43, lbs, it, soon, began, passing, green, starvation, stools, and, died, within, three, days, a, fourth, child, weighing, 2, 76, kg, also, developed, green, stools, and, died, within, four, days, at, this, point, depaul, stopped, the, experiment, at, first, depaul, kept, the, experiment, to, himself, but, he, attended, a, meeting, of, the, french, academy, of, medicine, and, while, didn, t, want, to, say, anything, at, first, he, felt, he, had, to, after, another, member, of, the, academy, rose, to, speak, a, pharmacist, named, nicholas, jean, baptiste, gaston, guibourt, guibourt, had, grave, doubts, about, liebig, s, artificial, milk, calling, it, fake, milk, in, french, lait, factice, as, historian, caroline, lieffers, has, written, he, worried, that, the, substance, would, either, spoil, in, liquid, form, or, lose, its, nutritive, quality, and, convenience, in, solid, form, upon, hearing, guibourt, speak, depaul, felt, it, incumbent, upon, him, to, speak, as, well, and, mentioned, his, experiments, with, liebig, s, formula, many, ethical, questions, were, quickly, raised, publications, in, france, generally, supported, depaul, while, german, publications, rallied, to, liebig, s, defense, liebig, founded, the, journal, annalen, der, chemie, which, he, edited, from, 1832, originally, titled, annalen, der, pharmacie, it, became, annalen, der, chemie, und, pharmacie, to, more, accurately, reflect, its, content, it, became, the, leading, journal, of, organic, chemistry, and, still, exists, albeit, under, the, name, european, journal, of, organic, chemistry, after, several, mergers, with, other, journals, the, volumes, from, his, lifetime, are, often, referenced, just, as, liebigs, annalen, following, his, death, the, title, was, officially, changed, to, justus, liebig, s, annalen, der, chemie, liebig, published, widely, in, liebigs, annalen, and, elsewhere, in, newspapers, and, journals, most, of, his, books, were, published, concurrently, in, both, german, and, english, and, many, were, translated, into, other, languages, as, well, some, of, his, most, influential, titles, include, in, addition, to, books, and, articles, he, wrote, thousands, of, letters, most, of, them, to, other, scientists, 273, liebig, also, directly, influenced, the, german, publication, of, john, stuart, mill, s, logic, liebig, had, a, close, friendship, with, the, vieweg, family, publishing, house, he, arranged, for, his, former, student, jacob, schiel, 1813, 1889, to, translate, mill, s, important, work, for, german, publication, liebig, liked, mill, s, logic, in, part, because, it, promoted, science, as, a, means, to, social, and, political, progress, but, also, because, mill, featured, several, examples, of, liebig, s, research, as, an, ideal, for, the, scientific, method, in, this, way, he, sought, to, reform, politics, in, the, german, states, 298, 299, in, 1852, after, asking, hermann, kopp, to, take, over, management, of, the, annalen, der, chemie, liebig, accepted, an, appointment, from, king, maximilian, ii, of, bavaria, to, the, ludwig, maximilian, university, of, munich, he, also, became, the, royal, scientific, advisor, to, king, maxilimian, ii, who, hoped, to, transform, the, university, of, munich, into, a, center, for, scientific, research, and, development, 315, in, part, liebig, accepted, the, post, because, at, age, 50, he, was, finding, supervision, of, large, numbers, of, laboratory, students, increasingly, difficult, his, new, accommodations, in, munich, reflected, this, shift, in, focus, they, included, a, comfortable, house, suitable, for, extensive, entertaining, a, small, laboratory, and, a, newly, built, lecture, theatre, capable, of, holding, 300, people, with, a, demonstration, laboratory, at, the, front, there, he, gave, lectures, to, the, university, and, fortnightly, to, the, public, in, his, position, as, a, promoter, of, science, liebig, was, appointed, president, of, the, bavarian, academy, of, sciences, and, humanities, becoming, perpetual, president, of, the, royal, bavarian, academy, of, sciences, in, 1858, 291, 297, in, the, 1850s, liebig, moved, next, door, to, the, noted, classics, scholar, and, philologist, friederich, thiersch, in, the, city, of, munich, liebig, had, previously, scorned, philologists, like, thiersch, in, articles, liebig, promoted, science, over, supposedly, impractical, fields, like, the, classics, but, liebig, s, most, beloved, daughter, johanna, fell, in, love, with, thiersch, s, second, son, karl, who, had, studied, medicine, in, several, cities, including, berlin, and, vienna, johanna, and, karl, reportedly, had, a, happy, marriage, producing, six, children, four, daughters, and, two, sons, it, was, fairly, common, for, the, sons, and, daughters, of, academics, to, marry, in, germany, then, liebig, enjoyed, a, personal, friendship, with, maximilian, ii, who, died, on, 10, march, 1864, after, maximilian, s, death, liebig, and, other, liberal, protestant, scientists, in, bavaria, were, increasingly, opposed, by, ultramontane, catholics, 319, liebig, died, in, munich, in, 1873, and, is, buried, in, the, alter, s, dfriedhof, in, munich, liebig, was, elected, a, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1837, he, became, a, first, class, member, of, the, ludwig, order, founded, by, ludwig, i, and, awarded, by, ludwig, ii, on, 24, july, 1837, 106, in, 1838, he, became, a, correspondent, of, the, royal, institute, of, the, netherlands, when, that, became, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1851, he, joined, as, a, foreign, member, the, british, royal, society, awarded, him, the, copley, medal, for, his, discoveries, in, organic, chemistry, and, particularly, for, his, development, of, the, composition, and, theory, of, organic, radicals, in, 1840, 96, in, 1841, botanist, stephan, friedrich, ladislaus, endlicher, 1804, 1849, published, a, genus, of, flowering, plants, from, malesia, belonging, to, the, family, gesneriaceae, as, liebigia, in, his, honour, king, ludwig, ii, of, bavaria, ennobled, liebig, on, 29, december, 1845, conferring, on, him, the, hereditary, title, of, freiherr, von, liebig, in, english, the, closest, translation, is, baron, von, liebig, 106, in, 1850, he, received, the, french, l, gion, d, honneur, presented, by, chemist, jean, baptiste, dumas, the, french, trade, minister, he, was, honored, with, the, prussian, order, of, merit, for, science, by, friedrich, wilhelm, iv, of, prussia, in, 1851, he, was, elected, as, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1862, in, 1869, liebig, was, awarded, the, albert, medal, by, the, royal, society, of, arts, for, his, numerous, valuable, researches, and, writings, which, have, contributed, most, importantly, to, the, development, of, food, economy, and, agriculture, to, the, advancement, of, chemical, science, and, to, the, benefits, derived, from, that, science, by, arts, manufactures, and, commerce, liebig, s, portrait, appeared, on, the, 100, banknote, issued, by, the, reichsbank, from, 1935, until, 1945, printing, ceased, in, 1945, but, the, note, remained, in, circulation, until, the, issue, of, the, deutsche, mark, on, 21, june, 1948, in, 1946, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, university, of, giessen, was, officially, renamed, after, him, justus, liebig, universit, t, giessen, in, 1953, the, west,
