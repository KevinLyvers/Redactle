enthroned, when, the, city, was, at, the, height, of, its, influence, and, power, within, the, roman, empire, cyril, wrote, extensively, and, was, a, major, player, in, the, christological, controversies, of, the, late, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, he, was, a, central, figure, in, the, council, of, ephesus, in, 431, which, led, to, the, deposition, of, nestorius, as, patriarch, of, constantinople, cyril, is, counted, among, the, church, fathers, and, also, as, a, doctor, of, the, church, and, his, reputation, within, the, christian, world, has, resulted, in, his, titles, pillar, of, faith, and, seal, of, all, the, fathers, the, nestorian, bishops, at, their, synod, at, the, council, of, ephesus, declared, him, a, heretic, labelling, him, as, a, monster, born, and, educated, for, the, destruction, of, the, church, cyril, is, well, known, for, his, dispute, with, nestorius, and, his, supporter, patriarch, john, of, antioch, whom, cyril, excluded, from, the, council, of, ephesus, for, arriving, late, he, is, also, known, for, his, expulsion, of, novatians, and, jews, from, alexandria, and, for, inflaming, tensions, that, led, to, the, murder, of, the, hellenistic, philosopher, hypatia, by, a, christian, mob, historians, disagree, over, the, extent, of, his, responsibility, in, this, cyril, tried, to, oblige, the, pious, christian, emperor, theodosius, ii, ad, 408, 450, to, himself, by, dedicating, his, paschal, table, to, him, cyril, s, paschal, table, was, provided, with, a, metonic, basic, structure, in, the, form, of, a, 19, year, lunar, cycle, adopted, by, him, around, ad, 425, which, was, very, different, from, the, first, metonic, 19, year, lunar, cycle, invented, around, ad, 260, by, anatolius, but, exactly, equal, to, the, lunar, cycle, which, had, been, introduced, around, ad, 412, by, annianus, the, julian, equivalent, of, this, alexandrian, cycle, adopted, by, cyril, and, nowadays, referred, to, as, the, classical, alexandrian, 19, year, lunar, cycle, would, emerge, a, century, later, in, rome, as, the, basic, structure, of, dionysius, exiguus, paschal, table, ad, 525, the, catholic, church, did, not, commemorate, saint, cyril, in, the, tridentine, calendar, it, added, his, feast, only, in, 1882, assigning, to, it, the, date, of, 9, february, this, date, is, used, by, the, western, rite, orthodox, church, yet, the, 1969, catholic, calendar, revision, moved, it, to, 27, june, considered, to, be, the, day, of, the, saint, s, death, as, celebrated, by, the, coptic, orthodox, church, the, same, date, has, been, chosen, for, the, lutheran, calendar, the, eastern, orthodox, and, byzantine, catholic, churches, celebrate, his, feast, day, on, 9, june, and, also, together, with, pope, athanasius, i, of, alexandria, on, 18, january, cyril, is, remembered, in, the, church, of, england, with, a, commemoration, on, 27, june, little, is, known, for, certain, of, cyril, s, early, life, he, was, born, circa, 376, in, the, town, of, didouseya, egypt, modern, day, el, mahalla, el, kubra, a, few, years, after, his, birth, his, maternal, uncle, theophilus, rose, to, the, powerful, position, of, patriarch, of, alexandria, his, mother, remained, close, to, her, brother, and, under, his, guidance, cyril, was, well, educated, his, writings, show, his, knowledge, of, christian, writers, of, his, day, including, eusebius, origen, didymus, the, blind, and, writers, of, the, church, of, alexandria, he, received, the, formal, christian, education, standard, for, his, day, he, studied, grammar, from, age, twelve, to, fourteen, 390, 392, rhetoric, and, humanities, from, fifteen, to, twenty, 393, 397, and, finally, theology, and, biblical, studies, 398, 402, in, 403, he, accompanied, his, uncle, to, attend, the, synod, of, the, oak, in, constantinople, which, deposed, john, chrysostom, as, archbishop, of, constantinople, the, prior, year, theophilus, had, been, summoned, by, the, emperor, to, constantinople, to, apologize, before, a, synod, over, which, chrysostom, would, preside, on, account, of, several, charges, which, were, brought, against, him, by, certain, egyptian, monks, theophilus, had, them, persecuted, as, origenists, placing, himself, at, the, head, of, soldiers, and, armed, servants, theophilus, had, marched, against, the, monks, burned, their, dwellings, and, ill, treated, those, whom, he, captured, theophilus, arrived, at, constantinople, with, twenty, nine, of, his, suffragan, bishops, and, conferring, with, those, opposed, to, the, archbishop, drafted, a, long, list, of, largely, unfounded, accusations, against, chrysostom, who, refused, to, recognize, the, legality, of, a, synod, in, which, his, open, enemies, were, judges, chrysostom, was, subsequently, deposed, theophilus, died, on, 15, october, 412, and, cyril, was, made, pope, or, patriarch, of, alexandria, on, 18, october, 412, but, only, after, a, riot, between, his, supporters, and, those, of, his, rival, archdeacon, timotheus, according, to, socrates, scholasticus, the, alexandrians, were, always, rioting, thus, cyril, followed, his, uncle, in, a, position, that, had, become, powerful, and, influential, rivalling, that, of, the, prefect, in, a, time, of, turmoil, and, frequently, violent, conflict, between, the, cosmopolitan, city, s, pagan, jewish, and, christian, inhabitants, he, began, to, exert, his, authority, by, causing, the, churches, of, the, novatianists, to, be, closed, and, their, sacred, vessels, to, be, seized, orestes, praefectus, augustalis, of, the, diocese, of, egypt, steadfastly, resisted, cyril, s, ecclesiastical, encroachment, upon, secular, prerogatives, tension, between, the, parties, increased, when, in, 415, orestes, published, an, edict, that, outlined, new, regulations, regarding, mime, shows, and, dancing, exhibitions, in, the, city, which, attracted, large, crowds, and, were, commonly, prone, to, civil, disorder, of, varying, degrees, crowds, gathered, to, read, the, edict, shortly, after, it, was, posted, in, the, city, s, theater, cyril, sent, the, grammaticus, hierax, to, discover, the, content, of, the, edict, the, edict, angered, christians, as, well, as, jews, at, one, such, gathering, hierax, read, the, edict, and, applauded, the, new, regulations, prompting, a, disturbance, many, people, felt, that, hierax, was, attempting, to, incite, the, crowd, particularly, the, jews, into, sedition, orestes, had, hierax, tortured, in, public, in, a, theatre, this, order, had, two, aims, one, to, quell, the, riot, the, other, to, mark, orestes, authority, over, cyril, socrates, scholasticus, recounts, that, upon, hearing, of, hierex, s, severe, and, public, punishment, cyril, threatened, to, retaliate, against, the, jews, of, alexandria, with, the, utmost, severities, if, the, harassment, of, christians, did, not, cease, immediately, in, response, to, cyril, s, threat, the, jews, of, alexandria, grew, even, more, furious, eventually, resorting, to, violence, against, the, christians, they, plotted, to, flush, the, christians, out, at, night, by, running, through, the, streets, claiming, that, the, church, of, alexander, was, on, fire, when, christians, responded, to, what, they, were, led, to, believe, was, the, burning, down, of, their, church, the, jews, immediately, fell, upon, and, slew, them, by, using, rings, to, recognize, one, another, in, the, dark, and, killing, everyone, else, in, sight, when, the, morning, came, cyril, along, with, many, of, his, followers, took, to, the, city, s, synagogues, in, search, of, the, perpetrators, of, the, massacre, according, to, socrates, after, cyril, rounded, up, all, the, jews, in, alexandria, he, ordered, them, to, be, stripped, of, all, possessions, banished, them, from, alexandria, and, allowed, their, goods, to, be, pillaged, by, the, remaining, citizens, of, alexandria, scholasticus, alleges, that, all, the, jews, of, alexandria, were, banished, while, john, of, niki, says, it, was, only, those, involved, in, the, ambush, and, massacre, susan, wessel, says, that, while, it, is, not, clear, whether, scholasticus, was, a, novationist, whose, churches, cyril, had, closed, he, was, apparently, sympathetic, towards, them, and, repeatedly, accuses, cyril, of, abusing, his, episcopal, power, by, infringing, on, the, rights, and, duties, of, the, secular, authorities, wessel, says, however, socrates, probably, does, not, provide, accurate, and, unambiguous, information, about, cyril, s, relationship, to, imperial, authority, nonetheless, with, cyril, s, banishment, of, the, jews, however, many, orestes, was, filled, with, great, indignation, at, these, transactions, and, was, excessively, grieved, that, a, city, of, such, magnitude, should, have, been, suddenly, bereft, of, so, large, a, portion, of, its, population, because, of, this, the, feud, between, cyril, and, orestes, intensified, and, both, men, wrote, to, the, emperor, regarding, the, situation, eventually, cyril, attempted, to, reach, out, to, orestes, through, several, peace, overtures, including, attempted, mediation, and, when, that, failed, showed, him, the, gospels, which, he, interpreted, to, indicate, that, the, religious, authority, of, cyril, would, require, orestes, acquiescence, in, the, bishop, s, policy, nevertheless, orestes, remained, unmoved, by, such, gestures, this, refusal, almost, cost, orestes, his, life, nitrian, monks, came, from, the, desert, and, instigated, a, riot, against, orestes, among, the, population, of, alexandria, these, monks, had, resorted, to, violence, 15, years, before, during, a, controversy, between, theophilus, cyril, s, uncle, and, the, tall, brothers, the, monks, assaulted, orestes, and, accused, him, of, being, a, pagan, orestes, rejected, the, accusations, showing, that, he, had, been, baptised, by, the, archbishop, of, constantinople, a, monk, named, ammonius, threw, a, stone, hitting, orestes, in, the, head, the, prefect, had, ammonius, tortured, to, death, whereupon, the, patriarch, allegedly, honored, him, as, a, martyr, however, at, least, according, to, scholasticus, the, christian, community, displayed, a, general, lack, of, enthusiasm, for, ammonius, s, case, for, martyrdom, the, prefect, then, wrote, to, the, emperor, theodosius, ii, as, did, cyril, the, prefect, orestes, enjoyed, the, political, backing, of, hypatia, an, astronomer, philosopher, and, mathematician, who, had, considerable, moral, authority, in, the, city, of, alexandria, and, who, had, extensive, influence, indeed, many, students, from, wealthy, and, influential, families, came, to, alexandria, purposely, to, study, privately, with, hypatia, and, many, of, these, later, attained, high, posts, in, government, and, the, church, several, christians, thought, that, hypatia, s, influence, had, caused, orestes, to, reject, all, conciliatory, offerings, by, cyril, modern, historians, think, that, orestes, had, cultivated, his, relationship, with, hypatia, to, strengthen, a, bond, with, the, pagan, community, of, alexandria, as, he, had, done, with, the, jewish, one, in, order, to, better, manage, the, tumultuous, political, life, of, the, egyptian, capital, according, to, socrates, scholasticus, during, the, christian, season, of, lent, in, march, 415, a, mob, of, christians, under, the, leadership, of, a, lector, named, peter, raided, hypatia, s, carriage, as, she, was, travelling, home, they, dragged, her, into, a, building, known, as, the, kaisarion, a, former, pagan, temple, and, center, of, the, roman, imperial, cult, in, alexandria, that, had, been, converted, into, a, christian, church, there, the, mob, stripped, hypatia, naked, and, murdered, her, using, ostraka, which, can, either, be, translated, as, roof, tiles, or, oyster, shells, later, historian, john, of, niki, also, tells, a, similar, story, even, later, historian, byzantinist, fr, adrian, fortescue, says, that, the, mob, of, christian, parabalanies, and, peter, cruelly, tore, her, to, pieces, on, the, steps, of, a, church, damascius, adds, that, they, also, cut, out, her, eyeballs, they, tore, her, body, into, pieces, and, dragged, her, limbs, through, the, town, to, a, place, called, cinarion, where, they, set, them, on, fire, according, to, watts, this, was, in, line, with, the, traditional, manner, in, which, alexandrians, carried, the, bodies, of, the, vilest, criminals, outside, the, city, limits, to, cremate, them, as, a, way, of, symbolically, purifying, the, city, although, socrates, scholasticus, never, explicitly, identifies, hypatia, s, murderers, they, are, commonly, assumed, to, have, been, members, of, the, parabalani, christopher, haas, disputes, this, identification, arguing, that, the, murderers, were, more, likely, a, crowd, of, alexandrian, laymen, socrates, scholasticus, unequivocally, condemns, the, actions, of, the, mob, declaring, surely, nothing, can, be, farther, from, the, spirit, of, christianity, than, the, allowance, of, massacres, fights, and, transactions, of, that, sort, neoplatonist, historian, damascius, c, 458, c, 538, was, anxious, to, exploit, the, scandal, of, hypatia, s, death, and, attributed, responsibility, for, her, murder, to, bishop, cyril, and, his, christian, followers, damascius, s, account, of, the, christian, murder, of, hypatia, is, the, sole, historical, source, naming, bishop, cyril, some, modern, studies, as, well, as, the, 2009, hypatia, biopic, agora, represent, hypatia, as, falling, casualty, to, a, conflict, between, two, christian, factions, one, peaceful, and, moderate, and, led, by, orestes, with, the, support, of, hypatia, and, fundamentalist, faction, enforced, by, parabalani, and, led, by, patriarch, cyril, according, to, lexicographer, william, smith, she, was, accused, of, too, much, familiarity, with, orestes, prefect, of, alexandria, and, the, charge, spread, among, the, clergy, who, took, up, the, notion, that, she, interrupted, the, friendship, of, orestes, with, their, archbishop, cyril, scholasticus, alleges, that, hypatia, fell, victim, to, the, political, jealousy, which, at, the, time, prevailed, and, that, news, of, hypatia, s, murder, brought, no, small, disgrace, not, only, to, patriarch, cyril, but, to, the, whole, christian, church, in, alexandria, for, murder, and, slaughter, and, all, such, things, are, altogether, opposed, to, the, christian, religion, after, the, murder, a, deputation, of, citizens, went, to, constantinople, to, petition, the, emperor, for, an, investigation, so, as, to, prevent, such, horrors, in, the, future, and, to, put, down, the, disorderly, parabalani, however, they, urged, for, the, patriarch, to, be, allowed, to, remain, in, the, city, orestes, wanted, him, banished, one, could, deduce, from, this, that, there, were, some, who, didn, t, think, cyril, responsible, for, this, or, that, even, his, own, followers, thought, he, went, too, far, however, according, to, damascius, cyril, himself, allegedly, only, managed, to, escape, even, more, serious, punishment, by, bribing, one, of, theodosius, s, officials, indeed, the, investigation, resulted, in, the, emperors, honorius, and, theodosius, ii, issuing, an, edict, in, autumn, of, 416, which, attempted, to, remove, the, parabalani, from, cyril, s, power, and, instead, place, them, under, the, authority, of, orestes, the, edict, restricted, the, parabalani, from, attending, any, public, spectacle, whatever, or, entering, the, meeting, place, of, a, municipal, council, or, a, courtroom, it, also, severely, restricted, their, recruitment, by, limiting, the, total, number, of, parabalani, to, no, more, than, five, hundred, another, major, conflict, was, between, the, alexandrian, and, antiochian, schools, of, ecclesiastical, reflection, piety, and, discourse, this, long, running, conflict, widened, with, the, third, canon, of, the, first, council, of, constantinople, which, granted, the, see, of, constantinople, primacy, over, the, older, sees, of, alexandria, and, antioch, thus, the, struggle, between, the, sees, of, alexandria, and, antioch, now, included, constantinople, the, conflict, came, to, a, head, in, 428, after, nestorius, who, originated, in, antioch, was, made, archbishop, of, constantinople, cyril, gained, an, opportunity, to, restore, alexandria, s, pre, eminence, over, both, antioch, and, constantinople, when, an, antiochine, priest, who, was, in, constantinople, at, nestorius, behest, began, to, preach, against, calling, mary, the, mother, of, god, theotokos, as, the, term, mother, of, god, had, long, been, attached, to, mary, the, laity, in, constantinople, complained, against, the, priest, rather, than, repudiating, the, priest, nestorius, intervened, on, his, behalf, nestorius, argued, that, mary, was, neither, a, mother, of, man, nor, mother, of, god, as, these, referred, to, christ, s, two, natures, rather, mary, was, the, mother, of, christ, greek, christotokos, christ, according, to, nestorius, was, the, conjunction, of, the, godhead, with, his, temple, which, nestorius, was, fond, of, calling, his, human, nature, the, controversy, seemed, to, be, centered, on, the, issue, of, the, suffering, of, christ, cyril, maintained, that, the, son, of, god, or, the, divine, word, truly, suffered, in, the, flesh, however, nestorius, claimed, that, the, son, of, god, was, altogether, incapable, of, suffering, even, within, his, union, with, the, flesh, eusebius, of, dorylaeum, went, so, far, as, to, accuse, nestorius, of, adoptionism, by, this, time, news, of, the, controversy, in, the, capital, had, reached, alexandria, at, easter, 429, a, d, cyril, wrote, a, letter, to, the, egyptian, monks, warning, them, of, nestorius, s, views, a, copy, of, this, letter, reached, constantinople, where, nestorius, preached, a, sermon, against, it, this, began, a, series, of, letters, between, cyril, and, nestorius, which, gradually, became, more, strident, in, tone, finally, emperor, theodosius, ii, convoked, the, council, of, ephesus, in, 431, to, solve, the, dispute, cyril, selected, ephesus, as, the, venue, since, it, supported, the, veneration, of, mary, the, council, was, convoked, before, nestorius, s, supporters, from, antioch, and, syria, had, arrived, and, thus, nestorius, refused, to, attend, when, summoned, predictably, the, council, ordered, the, deposition, and, exile, of, nestorius, for, heresy, however, when, john, of, antioch, and, the, other, pro, nestorius, bishops, finally, reached, ephesus, they, assembled, their, own, council, condemned, cyril, for, heresy, deposed, him, from, his, see, and, labelled, him, as, a, monster, born, and, educated, for, the, destruction, of, the, church, theodosius, by, now, old, enough, to, hold, power, by, himself, annulled, the, verdict, of, the, council, and, arrested, cyril, but, cyril, eventually, escaped, having, fled, to, egypt, cyril, bribed, theodosius, s, courtiers, and, sent, a, mob, led, by, dalmatius, a, hermit, to, besiege, theodosius, s, palace, and, shout, abuse, the, emperor, eventually, gave, in, sending, nestorius, into, minor, exile, upper, egypt, cyril, died, about, 444, but, the, controversies, were, to, continue, for, decades, from, the, robber, synod, of, ephesus, 449, to, the, council, of, chalcedon, 451, and, beyond, cyril, regarded, the, embodiment, of, god, in, the, person, of, jesus, christ, to, be, so, mystically, powerful, that, it, spread, out, from, the, body, of, the, god, man, into, the, rest, of, the, race, to, reconstitute, human, nature, into, a, graced, and, deified, condition, of, the, saints, one, that, promised, immortality, and, transfiguration, to, believers, nestorius, on, the, other, hand, saw, the, incarnation, as, primarily, a, moral, and, ethical, example, to, the, faithful, to, follow, in, the, footsteps, of, jesus, cyril, s, constant, stress, was, on, the, simple, idea, that, it, was, god, who, walked, the, streets, of, nazareth, hence, mary, was, theotokos, meaning, god, bearer, which, became, in, latin, mater, dei, or, dei, genitrix, or, mother, of, god, and, god, who, had, appeared, in, a, transfigured, humanity, nestorius, spoke, of, the, distinct, jesus, the, man, and, the, divine, logos, in, ways, that, cyril, thought, were, too, dichotomous, widening, the, ontological, gap, between, man, and, god, in, a, way, that, some, of, his, contemporaries, believed, would, annihilate, the, person, of, christ, the, main, issue, that, prompted, this, dispute, between, cyril, and, nestorius, was, the, question, which, arose, at, the, council, of, constantinople, what, exactly, was, the, being, to, which, mary, gave, birth, cyril, affirmed, that, the, holy, trinity, consists, of, a, singular, divine, nature, essence, and, being, ousia, in, three, distinct, aspects, instantiations, or, subsistencies, of, being, hypostases, these, distinct, hypostases, are, the, father, the, son, or, word, logos, and, the, holy, spirit, then, when, the, son, became, flesh, and, entered, the, world, the, pre, incarnate, divine, nature, and, assumed, human, nature, both, remained, but, became, united, in, the, person, of, jesus, this, resulted, in, the, miaphysite, slogan, one, nature, united, out, of, two, being, used, to, encapsulate, the, theological, position, of, this, alexandrian, bishop, according, to, cyril, s, theology, there, were, two, states, for, the, son, of, god, the, state, that, existed, prior, to, the, son, or, word, logos, becoming, enfleshed, in, the, person, of, jesus, and, the, state, that, actually, became, enfleshed, the, logos, incarnate, suffered, and, died, on, the, cross, and, therefore, the, son, was, able, to, suffer, without, suffering, cyril, passionately, argued, for, the, continuity, of, a, single, subject, god, the, word, from, the, pre, incarnate, state, to, the, incarnate, state, the, divine, logos, was, really, present, in, the, flesh, and, in, the, world, not, merely, bestowed, upon, semantically, affixed, to, or, morally, associated, with, the, man, jesus, as, the, adoptionists, and, he, believed, nestorius, had, taught, cyril, of, alexandria, became, noted, in, church, history, because, of, his, spirited, fight, for, the, title, theotokos, during, the, first, council, of, ephesus, 431, establishing, the, ecclesiastically, settled, basis, for, all, subsequent, mariological, developments, prior, to, the, controversy, over, the, theology, of, nestorius, cyril, rarely, if, ever, used, the, mariological, title, but, theo, political, circumstances, compelled, him, as, archbishop, of, one, of, the, empire, s, chief, sees, to, become, involved, and, develop, his, theology, beginning, in, 429, cyril, wrote, a, series, of, letters, to, various, ecclesiastical, authorities, in, which, he, espoused, the, orthodoxy, of, theotokos, the, propriety, of, the, term, was, justified, through, appeals, to, earlier, theologians, who, had, used, it, like, athanasius, the, cappadocians, and, atticus, following, an, epistolary, exchange, with, the, increasingly, unpopular, archbishop, of, constantinople, in, 430, cyril, wrote, his, famous, 12, anathemas, in, which, anyone, who, refused, to, call, mary, theotokos, was, condemned, the, following, year, over, 100, bishops, met, in, council, at, ephesus, to, rule, on, the, disputes, in, between, sessions, at, the, council, cyril, delivered, a, number, of, sermons, some, of, those, attributed, to, his, hand, are, of, disputed, authorship, but, 6, are, recognised, as, genuine, homily, iv, delivered, upon, the, late, arrival, of, western, delegates, is, a, particularly, striking, example, of, cyril, s, developed, mariology, it, is, the, foremost, expression, of, cyril, s, devotion, to, mary, and, is, one, of, the, first, historical, attestations, of, the, salutation, hail, being, used, to, invoke, the, virgin, a, practice, later, standardised, in, byzantine, homiletics, and, hymnography, such, as, the, sermons, of, chrysippus, and, basil, of, selecucia, and, the, akathist, hymn, mary, who, is, credited, with, calling, the, council, fathers, together, embodies, for, cyril, the, paradoxes, of, orthodox, christology, container, of, the, uncontained, and, the, place, for, the, infinite, among, other, lauded, descriptions, cyril, s, notions, of, the, identity, of, christ, therefore, have, direct, bearing, on, the, identity, of, mary, wessell, explains, how, cyril, s, spatial, metaphors, construed, mary, as, a, sacred, place, and, how, he, applied, metaphors, depicting, royalty, and, exaltation, to, mary, she, was, the, treasure, of, the, world, the, crown, of, virginity, and, the, sceptre, of, orthodoxy, subsequently, such, praise, would, become, normative, in, marian, theology, in, several, of, his, works, cyril, focuses, on, the, love, of, jesus, to, his, mother, on, the, cross, he, overcomes, his, pain, and, thinks, of, his, mother, at, the, wedding, in, cana, he, bows, to, her, wishes, the, conflict, with, nestorius, was, mainly, over, this, issue, and, some, have, argued, that, it, has, often, been, misunderstood, he, debate, was, not, so, much, about, mary, as, about, jesus, the, question, was, not, what, honors, were, due, to, mary, but, how, one, was, to, speak, of, the, birth, of, jesus, wessell, notes, that, in, homily, v, delivered, at, the, council, cyril, argued, that, nestorius, refusal, to, acknowledge, god, s, incarnate, birth, from, mary, was, a, blasphemy, against, christ, at, the, same, time, the, close, relationship,
