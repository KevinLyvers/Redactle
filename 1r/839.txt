marcel, mauss, french, 10, may, 1872, 10, february, 1950, was, a, french, sociologist, and, anthropologist, known, as, the, father, of, french, ethnology, the, nephew, of, mile, durkheim, mauss, in, his, academic, work, crossed, the, boundaries, between, sociology, and, anthropology, today, he, is, perhaps, better, recognised, for, his, influence, on, the, latter, discipline, particularly, with, respect, to, his, analyses, of, topics, such, as, magic, sacrifice, and, gift, exchange, in, different, cultures, around, the, world, mauss, had, a, significant, influence, upon, claude, l, vi, strauss, the, founder, of, structural, anthropology, his, most, famous, work, is, the, gift, 1925, mauss, was, born, in, pinal, vosges, to, a, jewish, family, his, father, a, merchant, and, his, mother, an, embroidery, shop, owner, unlike, his, younger, brother, mauss, did, not, join, the, family, business, and, instead, he, joined, the, socialist, and, cooperative, movement, in, the, vosges, following, the, death, of, his, grandfather, the, mauss, and, durkheim, families, grew, close, and, at, this, time, mauss, began, to, feel, concerned, about, his, education, and, took, initiatives, in, order, to, learn, mauss, obtained, a, religious, education, and, was, bar, mitzvahed, yet, by, the, age, of, eighteen, he, stopped, practicing, his, religion, mauss, studied, philosophy, at, bordeaux, where, his, maternal, uncle, mile, durkheim, was, teaching, at, the, time, in, the, 1890s, mauss, began, his, lifelong, study, of, linguistics, indology, sanskrit, hebrew, and, the, history, of, religions, and, uncivilized, peoples, at, the, cole, pratique, des, hautes, tudes, he, passed, the, agr, gation, in, 1893, he, was, also, the, first, cousin, of, the, much, younger, claudette, n, e, raphael, bloch, a, marine, biologist, and, mother, of, maurice, bloch, who, became, a, noted, anthropologist, instead, of, taking, the, usual, route, of, teaching, at, a, lyc, e, following, college, mauss, moved, to, paris, and, took, up, the, study, of, comparative, religion, and, sanskrit, his, first, publication, in, 1896, marked, the, beginning, of, a, prolific, career, that, would, produce, several, landmarks, in, sociological, literature, like, many, members, of, the, ann, e, sociologique, group, mauss, was, attracted, to, socialism, especially, that, espoused, by, jean, jaur, s, he, was, particularly, engaged, around, the, anti, semitic, political, events, of, the, dreyfus, affair, towards, the, end, of, the, century, he, helped, edit, such, left, wing, papers, as, le, populaire, l, humanit, and, le, mouvement, socialiste, the, last, in, collaboration, with, georges, sorel, in, 1901, mauss, began, drawing, more, on, ethnography, and, his, work, began, to, develop, characteristics, now, associated, with, formal, anthropology, mauss, served, in, the, french, army, during, world, war, i, from, 1914, to, 1919, as, an, interpreter, the, military, service, was, liberating, from, mauss, s, intense, academics, as, he, stated, i, m, doing, wonderfully, i, just, wasn, t, made, for, the, intellectual, life, and, i, am, enjoying, the, life, war, is, giving, me, fournier, 2006, 175, while, liberating, he, also, dealt, with, the, devastation, and, violence, of, the, war, as, many, of, his, friends, and, colleagues, died, in, the, war, and, his, uncle, durkheim, died, shortly, before, its, end, mauss, began, to, write, a, book, on, politics, that, remained, unfinished, but, the, early, 1920s, emphasized, his, energy, for, politics, through, criticism, of, the, bolshevik, s, coercive, resort, to, violence, and, their, destruction, of, the, market, economy, like, many, other, followers, of, durkheim, mauss, took, refuge, in, administration, he, secured, durkheim, s, legacy, by, founding, institutions, to, carry, out, research, such, as, l, institut, fran, ais, de, sociologie, 1924, and, l, institut, d, ethnologie, in, 1926, these, institutions, stimulated, the, development, of, fieldwork, based, anthropology, by, young, academics, among, the, students, he, influenced, were, george, devereux, jeanne, cuisinier, alfred, metraux, marcel, griaule, georges, dumezil, denise, paulme, michel, leiris, germaine, dieterlen, louis, dumont, andre, georges, haudricourt, jacques, soustelle, and, germaine, tillion, in, 1901, mauss, was, appointed, to, the, chair, of, the, history, of, religions, of, non, civilized, peoples, at, the, cole, pratique, des, hautes, tudes, two, years, later, in, 1931, mauss, was, elected, as, the, first, holder, of, the, chair, of, sociology, in, the, coll, ge, de, france, and, soon, after, he, married, his, secretary, in, 1934, who, soon, was, bedridden, after, a, poisonous, gas, incident, later, in, 1940, mauss, was, forced, out, of, his, job, as, the, chair, of, sociology, and, out, of, paris, due, to, the, german, occupation, and, anti, semitic, legislation, passed, mauss, remained, socially, isolated, following, the, war, and, died, in, 1950, marcel, mauss, and, emile, durkheim, marcel, mauss, s, studies, under, his, uncle, durkheim, at, bordeaux, led, to, their, doing, work, together, on, primitive, classification, which, was, published, in, the, ann, e, sociologique, in, this, work, mauss, and, durkheim, attempted, to, create, a, french, version, of, the, sociology, of, knowledge, illustrating, the, various, paths, of, human, thought, taken, by, different, cultures, in, particular, how, space, and, time, are, connected, back, to, societal, patterns, they, focused, their, study, on, tribal, societies, in, order, to, achieve, depth, while, mauss, called, himself, a, durkheimian, he, interpreted, the, school, of, durkheim, as, his, own, his, early, works, reflect, the, dependence, on, durkheim, s, school, yet, as, more, works, including, unpublished, texts, were, read, mauss, preferred, to, start, many, projects, and, often, not, finish, them, mauss, concerned, himself, more, with, politics, than, his, uncle, as, a, member, of, the, collectivistes, french, workers, party, and, revolutionary, socialist, workers, party, his, political, involvement, led, up, to, and, after, world, war, i, the, gift, mauss, has, been, credited, for, his, analytic, framework, which, has, been, characterized, as, more, supple, more, appropriate, for, the, application, of, empirical, studies, and, more, fruitful, than, his, earlier, studies, with, durkheim, his, work, fell, into, two, categories, one, being, major, ethnological, works, on, exchange, as, a, symbolic, system, body, techniques, and, the, category, of, the, person, and, the, second, being, social, science, methodology, in, his, classic, work, the, gift, mauss, argued, that, gifts, are, never, truly, free, rather, human, history, is, full, of, examples, of, gifts, bringing, about, reciprocal, exchange, the, famous, question, that, drove, his, inquiry, into, the, anthropology, of, the, gift, was, what, power, resides, in, the, object, given, that, causes, its, recipient, to, pay, it, back, the, answer, is, simple, the, gift, is, a, total, prestation, see, law, of, obligations, imbued, with, spiritual, mechanisms, engaging, the, honour, of, both, giver, and, receiver, the, term, total, prestation, or, total, social, fact, fait, social, total, was, coined, by, his, student, maurice, leenhardt, after, durkheim, s, social, fact, such, transactions, transcend, the, divisions, between, the, spiritual, and, the, material, in, a, way, that, according, to, mauss, is, almost, magical, the, giver, does, not, merely, give, an, object, but, also, part, of, himself, for, the, object, is, indissolubly, tied, to, the, giver, the, objects, are, never, completely, separated, from, the, men, who, exchange, them, 1990, 31, because, of, this, bond, between, giver, and, gift, the, act, of, giving, creates, a, social, bond, with, an, obligation, to, reciprocate, on, the, part, of, the, recipient, not, to, reciprocate, means, to, lose, honour, and, status, but, the, spiritual, implications, can, be, even, worse, in, polynesia, failure, to, reciprocate, means, to, lose, mana, one, s, spiritual, source, of, authority, and, wealth, to, cite, goldman, ida, s, summary, mauss, distinguished, between, three, obligations, giving, the, necessary, initial, step, for, the, creation, and, maintenance, of, social, relationships, receiving, for, to, refuse, to, receive, is, to, reject, the, social, bond, and, reciprocating, in, order, to, demonstrate, one, s, own, liberality, honour, and, wealth, 2018, 341, mauss, describes, how, society, is, blinded, by, ideology, and, therefore, a, system, of, prestations, survives, in, societies, when, regarding, the, economy, institutions, are, founded, on, the, unity, of, individuals, and, society, and, capitalism, rests, on, an, unsustainable, influence, on, an, individual, s, wants, rather, than, focusing, on, money, mauss, describes, the, need, to, focus, on, faits, sociaux, totaux, total, social, facts, which, are, legal, economic, religious, and, aesthetic, facts, which, challenge, the, sociological, method, an, important, notion, in, mauss, s, conceptualization, of, gift, exchange, is, what, gregory, 1982, 1997, refers, to, as, inalienability, in, a, commodity, economy, there, is, a, strong, distinction, between, objects, and, persons, through, the, notion, of, private, property, objects, are, sold, meaning, that, the, ownership, rights, are, fully, transferred, to, the, new, owner, the, object, has, thereby, become, alienated, from, its, original, owner, in, a, gift, economy, however, the, objects, that, are, given, are, unalienated, from, the, givers, they, are, loaned, rather, than, sold, and, ceded, it, is, the, fact, that, the, identity, of, the, giver, is, invariably, bound, up, with, the, object, given, that, causes, the, gift, to, have, a, power, which, compels, the, recipient, to, reciprocate, because, gifts, are, unalienable, they, must, be, returned, the, act, of, giving, creates, a, gift, debt, that, has, to, be, repaid, because, of, this, the, notion, of, an, expected, return, of, the, gift, creates, a, relationship, over, time, between, two, individuals, in, other, words, through, gift, giving, a, social, bond, evolves, that, is, assumed, to, continue, through, space, and, time, until, the, future, moment, of, exchange, gift, exchange, therefore, leads, to, a, mutual, interdependence, between, giver, and, receiver, according, to, mauss, the, free, gift, that, is, not, returned, is, a, contradiction, because, it, cannot, create, social, ties, following, the, durkheimian, quest, for, understanding, social, cohesion, through, the, concept, of, solidarity, mauss, s, argument, is, that, solidarity, is, achieved, through, the, social, bonds, created, by, gift, exchange, mauss, emphasizes, that, exchanging, gifts, resulted, from, the, will, of, attaching, other, people, to, put, people, under, obligations, because, in, theory, such, gifts, are, voluntary, but, in, fact, they, are, given, and, repaid, under, obligation, mauss, and, hubert, mauss, also, focused, on, the, topic, of, sacrifice, the, book, sacrifice, and, its, function, which, he, wrote, with, henri, hubert, in, 1899, argued, that, sacrifice, is, a, process, involving, sacralising, and, desacralising, this, was, when, the, former, directed, the, holy, towards, the, person, or, object, and, the, latter, away, from, a, person, or, object, mauss, and, hubert, proposed, that, the, body, is, better, understood, not, as, a, natural, given, instead, it, should, be, seen, as, the, product, of, specific, training, in, attributes, deportments, and, habits, furthermore, the, body, techniques, are, biological, sociological, and, psychological, and, in, doing, an, analysis, of, the, body, one, must, apprehend, these, elements, simultaneously, they, defined, the, person, as, a, category, of, thought, the, articulation, of, particular, embodiment, of, law, and, morality, mauss, and, hubert, believed, that, a, person, was, constituted, by, personages, a, set, of, roles, which, were, executed, through, the, behaviors, and, exercise, of, specific, body, techniques, and, attributes, mauss, and, hubert, wrote, another, book, titled, a, general, theory, of, magic, in, 1902, they, studied, magic, in, primitive, societies, and, how, it, has, manifested, into, our, thoughts, and, social, actions, they, argue, that, social, facts, are, subjective, and, therefore, should, be, considered, magic, but, society, is, not, open, to, accepting, this, in, the, book, mauss, and, hubert, state, in, magic, we, have, officers, actions, and, representations, we, call, a, person, who, accomplishes, magical, actions, a, magician, even, if, he, is, not, professional, magical, representations, are, those, ideas, and, beliefs, which, correspond, to, magical, actions, as, for, these, actions, with, regard, to, which, we, have, defined, the, other, elements, of, magic, we, shall, call, them, magical, rites, at, this, stage, it, is, important, to, distinguish, between, these, activities, and, other, social, practices, with, which, they, might, be, confused, they, go, on, to, say, that, only, social, occurrences, can, be, considered, magical, individual, actions, are, not, magic, because, if, the, whole, community, does, not, believe, in, efficacy, of, a, group, of, actions, it, is, not, social, and, therefore, cannot, be, magical, while, mauss, is, known, for, several, of, his, own, works, most, notably, his, masterpiece, essai, sur, le, don, the, gift, much, of, his, best, work, was, done, in, collaboration, with, members, of, the, ann, e, sociologique, including, durkheim, primitive, classification, henri, hubert, outline, of, a, general, theory, of, magic, and, essay, on, the, nature, and, function, of, sacrifice, paul, fauconnet, sociology, and, others, mauss, influenced, french, anthropology, and, social, science, he, did, not, have, a, great, number, of, students, like, many, other, sociologists, did, however, he, taught, ethnographic, method, to, first, generation, french, anthropology, students, in, addition, to, this, mauss, s, ideas, have, had, a, significant, impact, on, anglophile, post, structuralist, perspectives, in, anthropology, cultural, studies, and, cultural, history, he, modified, post, structuralist, and, post, foucauldian, intellectuals, because, he, combines, an, ethnographic, approach, with, contextualization, that, is, historical, sociological, and, psychological, mauss, served, as, an, important, link, between, the, sociology, of, durkheim, and, contemporary, french, sociologists, some, of, these, sociologists, include, claude, levi, strauss, pierre, bourdieu, marcel, granet, and, louis, dumont, the, essay, on, the, gift, is, the, origin, for, anthropological, studies, of, reciprocity, his, analysis, of, the, potlatch, has, inspired, georges, bataille, the, accursed, share, then, the, situationists, the, name, of, the, first, situationist, journal, was, potlatch, this, term, has, been, used, by, many, interested, in, gift, economies, and, open, source, software, although, this, latter, use, sometimes, differs, from, mauss, s, original, formulation, see, also, lewis, hyde, s, revolutionary, critique, of, mauss, in, imagination, and, the, erotic, life, of, property, he, also, impacted, the, mouvement, anti, utilitariste, dans, les, sciences, sociales, and, david, graeber, mauss, s, views, on, the, nature, of, gift, exchange, have, had, critics, main, critiques, against, mauss, stem, from, beliefs, that, mauss, s, essay, is, analyzing, all, primitive, and, archaic, societies, but, rather, his, essay, is, used, to, apply, to, one, society, and, relationships, within, french, anthropologist, alain, testart, 1998, for, example, argues, that, there, are, free, gifts, such, as, passers, by, giving, money, to, beggars, e, g, in, a, large, western, city, donor, and, receiver, do, not, know, each, other, and, are, unlikely, ever, to, meet, again, in, this, context, the, donation, certainly, creates, no, obligation, on, the, side, of, the, beggar, to, reciprocate, neither, the, donor, nor, the, beggar, have, such, an, expectation, testart, argues, that, only, the, latter, can, actually, be, enforced, he, feels, that, mauss, overstated, the, magnitude, of, the, obligation, created, by, social, pressures, particularly, in, his, description, of, the, potlatch, amongst, north, american, indians, gift, economy, theorist, genevieve, vaughan, 1997, criticizes, the, french, school, of, thought, based, on, mauss, exemplified, by, jacques, godbout, and, serge, latouche, and, the, mouvement, anti, utilittarisse, des, sciences, sociales, for, defining, gift, giving, as, consisting, of, three, moments, giving, receiving, and, giving, back, the, insistence, upon, reciprocity, hides, the, communicative, character, of, simple, giving, and, receiving, without, reciprocity, and, does, not, allow, this, group, to, make, a, clear, distinction, between, gift, giving, and, exchange, as, two, opposing, paradigms, in, subsequent, works, for, example, the, gift, in, the, heart, of, language, the, maternal, source, of, meaning, 2015, vaughan, elaborated, on, gift, giving, as, a, relation, between, giver, and, receiver, that, takes, its, form, from, the, primal, human, experience, of, mothering, and, being, mothered, another, example, of, a, non, reciprocal, free, gift, is, provided, by, british, anthropologist, james, laidlaw, 2000, he, describes, the, social, context, of, indian, jain, renouncers, a, group, of, itinerant, celibate, renouncers, living, an, ascetic, life, of, spiritual, purification, and, salvation, the, jainist, interpretation, of, the, doctrine, of, ahimsa, an, extremely, rigorous, application, of, principles, of, nonviolence, influences, the, diet, of, jain, renouncers, and, compels, them, to, avoid, preparing, food, as, this, could, potentially, involve, violence, against, microscopic, organisms, since, jain, renouncers, do, not, work, they, rely, on, food, donations, from, lay, families, within, the, jain, community, however, the, former, must, not, appear, to, be, having, any, wants, or, desires, and, only, very, hesitantly, and, apologetically, receives, the, food, prepared, by, the, latter, free, gifts, therefore, challenge, the, aspects, of, the, maussian, notion, of, the, gift, unless, the, moral, and, non, material, qualities, of, gifting, are, considered, these, aspects, are, of, course, at, the, heart, of, the, gift, as, demonstrated, in, books, such, as, annette, weiner, s, 1992, inalienable, possessions, the, paradox, of, keeping, while, giving, mauss, s, view, on, sacrifice, was, also, controversial, at, the, time, this, was, because, it, conflicted, with, the, psychologisation, of, individuals, and, social, behavior, in, addition, to, this, mauss, s, terms, like, persona, and, habitus, have, been, used, among, some, sociological, approaches, french, philosopher, georges, bataille, used, the, gift, to, draw, new, conclusions, based, on, economic, anthropology, in, this, case, an, interpretation, of, how, money, is, increasingly, being, wasted, in, society, they, have, also, been, included, in, recent, sociological, and, cultural, studies, by, pierre, bourdieu, bourdieu, used, mauss, s, concept, habitus, through, sociological, concepts, of, socialization, the, embodiment, of, consciousness, an, example, being, muscle, memory
