of, russia, in, andersen, as, a, novelist, s, ren, kierkegaard, remarks, that, andersen, is, characterized, as, a, possibility, of, a, personality, wrapped, up, in, such, a, web, of, arbitrary, moods, and, moving, through, an, elegiac, duo, decimal, scaled, of, almost, echoless, dying, tones, just, as, easily, roused, as, subdued, who, in, order, to, become, a, personality, needs, a, strong, life, development, in, june, 1847, andersen, visited, england, for, the, first, time, enjoying, triumphant, social, success, the, countess, of, blessington, invited, him, to, her, parties, where, many,

were, on, the, veranda, and, i, was, so, happy, to, see, and, speak, to, england, s, now, living, writer, whom, i, do, love, the, most, the, two, authors, respected, each, other, s, work, and, each, other, as, writers, and, had, in, common, their, depictions, of, the, underclass, who, often, led, difficult, lives, affected, both, by, the, industrial, revolution, and, by, abject, poverty, in, 1857, andersen, visited, england, again, primarily, to, meet, dickens, andersen, extended, the, planned, brief, visit, to, dickens, home, at, gads, hill, place, into, a, five, week, stay, much, to, the, distress, of, dickens, family, after, andersen, was, told, to, leave, dickens, gradually, stopped, all, correspondence, between, them, to, andersen, s, great, disappointment, and, confusion, he, had, enjoyed, the, visit, and, never, understood, why, his, letters, went, unanswered, it, is, suspected, that, dickens, modeled, the, physical, appearance, and, mannerisms, of, uriah, heep, from, david, copperfield, after, andersen, in, andersen, s, early, life, his, private, journal, records, his, refusal, to, have, sexual, relations, andersen, experienced, homosexual, attraction, he, wrote, to, edvard, collin, i, languish, for, you, as, for, a, pretty, calabrian, wench, my, sentiments, for, you, are, those, of, a, woman, the, femininity, of, my, nature, and, our, friendship, must, remain, a, mystery, collin, wrote, in, his, own, memoir, i, found, myself, unable, to, respond, to, this, love, and, this, caused, the, author, much, suffering, andersen, s, infatuation, with, karl, alexander, the, young, hereditary, duke, of, saxe, weimar, eisenach, did, result, in, a, relationship, the, hereditary, grand, duke, walked, arm, in, arm, with, me, across, the, courtyard, of, the, castle, to, my, room, kissed, me, lovingly, asked, me, always, to, love, him, though, he, was, just, an, ordinary, person, asked, me, to, stay, with, him, this, winter, fell, asleep, with, the, melancholy, happy, feeling, that, i, was, the, guest, of, this, strange, prince, at, his, castle, and, loved, by, him, it, is, like, a, fairy, tale, there, is, a, sharp, division, in, opinion, over, andersen, s, physical, fulfillment, in, the, sexual, sphere, jackie, wullschlager, s, biography, maintains, he, was, possibly, lovers, with, danish, dancer, harald, scharff, and, andersen, s, the, snowman, was, inspired, by, their, relationship, scharff, first, met, andersen, when, the, latter, was, in, his, 50s, andersen, was, infatuated, and, wullschlager, sees, his, journals, as, implying, that, their, relationship, was, sexual, scharff, had, various, dinners, alone, with, andersen, and, gifted, a, silver, toothbrush, to, andersen, on, his, 57th, birthday, wullschlager, asserts, that, in, the, winter, of, 1861, 62, the, two, men, entered, an, affair, that, brought, andersen, joy, some, kind, of, sexual, fulfillment, and, a, temporary, end, to, loneliness, he, was, not, discreet, in, his, conduct, with, scharff, and, displayed, his, feelings, openly, onlookers, regarded, the, relationship, as, improper, and, ridiculous, in, his, diary, in, march, 1862, andersen, referred, to, this, time, in, his, life, as, his, erotic, period, on, 13, november, 1863, andersen, wrote, scharff, has, not, visited, me, in, eight, days, with, him, it, is, over, he, took, this, calmly, and, the, two, thereafter, met, in, overlapping, social, circles, without, bitterness, though, andersen, attempted, to, rekindle, their, relationship, many, times, without, success, according, to, wullschlager, andersen, s, diaries, leave, no, doubt, that, he, was, attracted, to, both, sexes, that, at, times, he, longed, for, a, physical, relationship, with, a, woman, and, that, at, other, times, he, was, involved, in, physical, liaisons, with, men, for, example, wullschlager, quotes, from, andersen, s, diaries, scharff, bounded, up, to, me, threw, himself, round, my, neck, and, kissed, me, nervous, in, the, evening, five, days, later, he, received, a, visit, from, scharff, who, was, very, intimate, and, nice, in, the, following, weeks, there, was, dinner, at, scharff, s, who, was, ardent, and, loving, the, claim, that, andersen, entertained, physical, liaisons, with, men, has, been, contested, by, klara, bom, and, anya, aarenstrup, from, the, h, c, andersen, centre, of, university, of, southern, denmark, they, state, it, is, correct, to, point, to, the, very, ambivalent, and, also, very, traumatic, elements, in, andersen, s, emotional, life, concerning, the, sexual, sphere, but, it, is, decidedly, just, as, wrong, to, describe, him, as, homosexual, and, maintain, that, he, had, physical, relationships, with, men, he, did, not, indeed, that, would, have, been, entirely, contrary, to, his, moral, and, religious, ideas, aspects, that, are, quite, outside, the, field, of, vision, of, wullschlager, and, her, like, wullschlager, in, fact, argued, that, because, of, moral, and, religious, ideas, of, his, time, andersen, could, not, be, open, about, his, homosexual, relationships, andersen, also, fell, in, love, with, unattainable, women, and, many, interpret, references, to, them, in, his, stories, at, one, point, andersen, wrote, in, his, diary, almighty, god, thee, only, have, i, thou, steerest, my, fate, i, must, give, myself, up, to, thee, give, me, a, livelihood, give, me, a, bride, my, blood, wants, love, as, my, heart, does, a, girl, named, riborg, voigt, was, the, unrequited, love, of, andersen, s, youth, a, small, pouch, containing, a, long, letter, from, voigt, was, found, on, andersen, s, chest, when, he, died, several, decades, after, andersen, first, fell, in, love, with, her, other, disappointments, in, love, included, sophie, rsted, the, daughter, of, the, physicist, hans, christian, rsted, and, louise, collin, the, youngest, daughter, of, his, benefactor, jonas, collin, one, of, andersen, s, stories, the, nightingale, was, written, as, an, expression, of, his, passion, for, jenny, lind, and, was, the, inspiration, for, her, nickname, the, swedish, nightingale, andersen, was, shy, around, women, and, had, extreme, difficulty, proposing, to, lind, when, lind, was, boarding, a, train, to, go, to, an, opera, concert, andersen, gave, lind, a, letter, of, proposal, her, feelings, towards, him, were, not, the, same, she, saw, andersen, as, a, brother, writing, to, him, in, 1844, farewell, god, bless, and, protect, my, brother, is, the, sincere, wish, of, his, affectionate, sister, jenny, it, is, suggested, that, andersen, expressed, his, disappointment, by, portraying, lind, as, the, eponymous, antihero, of, the, snow, queen, in, early, 1872, at, the, age, of, 67, andersen, fell, out, of, his, bed, and, was, severely, hurt, andersen, never, fully, recovered, from, the, resultant, injuries, soon, afterward, he, started, to, show, signs, of, liver, cancer, andersen, died, on, 4, august, 1875, at, the, age, of, 70, in, a, country, house, called, rolighed, literally, calmness, near, copenhagen, the, home, of, his, close, friends, the, banker, moritz, g, melchior, and, his, wife, shortly, before, his, death, andersen, consulted, a, composer, about, the, music, for, his, funeral, saying, most, of, the, people, who, will, walk, after, me, will, be, children, so, make, the, beat, keep, time, with, little, steps, andersen, s, body, was, interred, in, the, assistens, kirkeg, rd, in, the, n, rrebro, area, of, copenhagen, in, the, collin, family, plot, in, 1914, the, headstone, was, moved, to, another, cemetery, today, known, as, frederiksbergs, ldre, kirkegaard, where, younger, collin, family, members, were, buried, for, a, period, his, edvard, collin, s, and, henriette, collin, s, graves, were, unmarked, a, second, stone, has, been, erected, marking, andersen, s, grave, now, without, any, mention, of, the, collin, couple, but, all, three, still, share, the, same, plot, at, the, time, of, his, death, andersen, was, internationally, revered, and, the, danish, government, paid, him, an, annual, stipend, for, being, a, national, treasure, andersen, s, stories, laid, the, groundwork, for,
