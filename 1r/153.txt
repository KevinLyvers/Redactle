the, landmark, series, became, a, hit, that, revolutionized, the, industry, with, its, comparative, naturalism, and, eventually, a, cosmic, purview, informed, by, kirby, s, seemingly, boundless, imagination, one, well, matched, with, the, consciousness, expanding, youth, culture, of, the, 1960s, for, almost, a, decade, kirby, provided, marvel, s, house, style, creating, many, of, the, marvel,

time, he, rejoined, the, company, it, wasn, t, merely, that, jack, conceived, most, of, the, characters, that, are, being, done, but, jack, s, point, of, view, and, philosophy, of, drawing, became,

hated, the, way, he, was, doing, it, not, that, he, did, it, badly, it, just, wasn, t, the, character, i, wanted, it, was, too, heroic, 12, lee, then, turned, to, steve, ditko, to, draw, the, story, that, would, appear, in, amazing, fantasy, 15, for, which, kirby, nonetheless, penciled, the, cover, lee, and, kirby, gathered, several, of, their, newly, created, characters, together, into, the,

credit, for, such, creations, as, the, fantastic, four, the, story, frequently, cited, as, lee, and, kirby, s, finest, achievement, is, the, galactus, trilogy, in, fantastic, four, 48, 50, march, may,

four, came, to, a, close, stan, lee, and, jack, kirby, seemed, to, be, only, warming, up, in, retrospect, it, was, perhaps, the, most, fertile, period, of, any, monthly, title, during, the, marvel, age, comics, historian, les, daniels, noted, that, he, mystical, and, metaphysical, elements, that, took, over, the, saga, were, perfectly, suited, to, the, tastes, of, young, readers, in, the, 1960s, and, lee, soon, discovered, that, the, story, was, a, favorite, on, college, campuses, kirby, continued, to, expand, the, medium, s, boundaries, devising, photo, collage, covers, and, interiors, developing, new, drawing, techniques, such, as, the, method, for, depicting, energy, fields, now, known, as, kirby, krackle, and, other, experiments, in, 1968, and, 1969, joe, simon, was, involved, in, litigation, with, marvel, comics, over, the, ownership, of, captain, america, initiated, by, marvel, after, simon, registered, the, copyright, renewal, for, captain, america, in, his, own, name, according, to, simon, kirby, agreed, to, support, the, company, in, the, litigation, and, as, part, of, a, deal, kirby, made, with, publisher, martin, goodman, signed, over, to, marvel, any, rights, he, might, have, had, to, the, character, at, the, same, time, kirby, grew, increasingly, dissatisfied, with, working, at, marvel, for, reasons, kirby, biographer, mark, evanier, has, suggested, include, resentment, over, lee, s, media, prominence, a, lack, of, full, creative, control, anger, over, breaches, of, perceived, promises, by, publisher, martin, goodman, and, frustration, over, marvel, s, failure, to, credit, him, specifically, for, his, story, plotting, and, for, his, character, creations, and, co, creations, he, began, to, both, write, and, draw, some, secondary, features, for, marvel, such, as, the, inhumans, in, amazing, adventures, volume, two, as, well, as, horror, stories, for, the, anthology, title, chamber, of, darkness, and, received, full, credit, for, doing, so, but, in, 1970, kirby, was, presented, with, a, contract, that, included, unfavorable, terms, such, as, a, prohibition, against, legal, retaliation, when, kirby, objected, the, management, refused, to, negotiate, any, contract, changes, bluntly, dismissing, his, contribution, to, marvel, s, success, since, they, considered, lee, solely, responsible, kirby, although, he, was, earning, 35, 000, a, year, freelancing, for, the, company, adjusted, for, inflation, it, was, the, equivalent, of, over, 271, 000, in, 2024, then, left, marvel, in, 1970, for, rival, dc, comics, under, editorial, director, carmine, infantino, kirby, spent, nearly, two, years, negotiating, a, deal, to, move, to, dc, comics, where, in, late, 1970, he, signed, a, three, year, contract, with, an, option, for, two, additional, years, he, produced, a, series, of, interlinked, titles, under, the, blanket, sobriquet, the, fourth, world, which, included, a, trilogy, of, new, titles, new, gods, mister, miracle, and, the, forever, people, as, well, as, the, extant, superman, s, pal, jimmy, olsen, kirby, picked, the, latter, book, because, the, series, was, without, a, stable, creative, team, and, he, did, not, want, to, cost, anyone, a, job, the, three, books, kirby, originated, dealt, with, aspects, of, mythology, he, had, previously, touched, upon, in, thor, the, new, gods, would, establish, this, new, mythos, while, in, the, forever, people, kirby, would, attempt, to, mythologize, the, lives, of, the, young, people, he, observed, around, him, the, third, book, mister, miracle, was, more, of, a, personal, myth, the, title, character, was, an, escape, artist, which, mark, evanier, suggests, kirby, channeled, his, feelings, of, constraint, into, mister, miracle, s, wife, was, based, in, character, on, kirby, s, wife, roz, and, he, even, caricatured, stan, lee, within, the, pages, of, the, book, as, funky, flashman, a, depiction, lee, found, hurtful, while, kirby, tried, to, downplay, the, insult, when, confronted, about, it, by, lee, s, protege, roy, thomas, who, was, similarly, insulted, with, flashman, s, sidekick, houseroy, the, central, villain, of, the, fourth, world, series, darkseid, and, some, of, the, fourth, world, concepts, appeared, in, jimmy, olsen, before, the, launch, of, the, other, fourth, world, books, giving, the, new, titles, greater, exposure, to, potential, buyers, the, superman, figures, and, jimmy, olsen, faces, drawn, by, kirby, were, redrawn, by, al, plastino, and, later, by, murphy, anderson, les, daniels, observed, in, 1995, that, kirby, s, mix, of, slang, and, myth, science, fiction, and, the, bible, made, for, a, heady, brew, but, the, scope, of, his, vision, has, endured, in, 2007, comics, writer, grant, morrison, commented, that, kirby, s, dramas, were, staged, across, jungian, vistas, of, raw, symbol, and, storm, the, fourth, world, saga, crackles, with, the, voltage, of, jack, kirby, s, boundless, imagination, let, loose, onto, paper, in, addition, to, his, artistic, efforts, kirby, proposed, a, variety, of, new, formats, for, comics, such, as, planning, to, collect, his, published, fourth, world, stories, into, square, bound, books, a, format, that, would, later, be, called, the, trade, paperback, which, would, eventually, become, standard, practice, in, the, industry, however, infantino, and, company, were, not, receptive, and, kirby, s, proposals, only, went, as, far, as, producing, the, one, shot, black, and, white, magazines, spirit, world, and, in, the, days, of, the, mob, in, 1971, kirby, later, produced, other, dc, series, including, omac, kamandi, the, demon, and, kobra, as, well, as, working, on, such, extant, features, as, the, losers, in, our, fighting, forces, together, with, former, partner, joe, simon, for, one, last, time, he, worked, on, a, new, incarnation, of, the, sandman, kirby, produced, three, issues, of, the, 1st, issue, special, anthology, series, and, created, atlas, the, great, a, new, manhunter, and, the, dingbats, of, danger, street, kirby, s, production, assistant, of, the, time, mark, evanier, recounted, that, dc, s, policies, of, the, era, were, not, in, sync, with, kirby, s, creative, impulses, also, evanier, said, that, he, was, often, forced, to, work, on, characters, and, projects, which, he, did, not, like, meanwhile, some, artists, at, dc, did, not, want, kirby, there, as, he, threatened, their, positions, in, the, company, they, also, had, bad, blood, from, previous, competition, with, marvel, and, legal, problems, with, him, since, he, was, working, from, california, they, were, able, to, undermine, his, work, through, redesigns, in, the, new, york, office, at, the, comic, book, convention, marvelcon, 75, in, 1975, stan, lee, used, a, fantastic, four, panel, discussion, to, announce, that, kirby, was, returning, to, marvel, after, having, left, in, 1970, to, work, for, dc, comics, lee, wrote, in, his, monthly, column, stan, lee, s, soapbox, i, mentioned, that, i, had, a, special, announcement, to, make, as, i, started, telling, about, jack, s, return, to, a, totally, incredulous, audience, everyone, s, head, started, to, snap, around, as, kirby, himself, came, waltzin, down, the, aisle, to, join, us, on, the, rostrum, you, can, imagine, how, it, felt, clownin, around, with, the, co, creator, of, most, of, marvel, s, greatest, strips, once, more, back, at, marvel, kirby, both, wrote, and, drew, the, monthly, captain, america, series, as, well, as, the, captain, america, s, bicentennial, battles, one, shot, in, the, oversized, treasury, format, he, created, the, series, the, eternals, which, featured, a, race, of, inscrutable, alien, giants, the, celestials, whose, behind, the, scenes, intervention, in, primordial, humanity, would, eventually, become, a, core, element, of, marvel, universe, continuity, he, produced, an, adaptation, and, expansion, of, the, film, 2001, a, space, odyssey, as, well, as, an, abortive, attempt, to, do, the, same, for, the, classic, television, series, the, prisoner, he, wrote, and, drew, black, panther, and, drew, numerous, covers, across, the, line, kirby, s, other,

staff, especially, with, the, younger, artists, who, typically, credited, him, as, their, inspiration, he, worked, on, the, new, fantastic, four, animated, series, reuniting, him, with, scriptwriter, stan, lee, and, they, kept, their, relations, sufficiently, cordial, on, a, professional, level, he, illustrated, an, adaptation, of, the, walt, disney, movie, the, black, hole, for, walt, disney, s,

rights, of, his, original, page, boards, at, marvel, many, of, these, pages, owned, by, the, company, due, to, outdated, and, legally, dubious, copyright, claims, were, given, away, as, promotional, gifts, to, marvel, clients, or, simply, stolen, from, company, warehouses, after, the, passage, of, the, copyright, act, of, 1976, which, greatly, expanded, artist, copyright, capabilities, comics, publishers, began, to, return, original, art, to, creators, but, in, marvel, s, case, only, if, they, signed, a, release, reaffirming, marvel, s, ownership, of, the, copyright, in, 1985, marvel, issued, a, release, that, demanded, kirby, affirm, that, his, art, was, created, for, hire, allowing, marvel, to, retain, copyright, in, perpetuity, in, addition, to, demanding, that, kirby, forego,

in, a, way, that, makes, movie, versions, of, the, same, characters, seem, static, by, comparison, jack, kirby, has, been, referred, to, as, the, superhero, of, style, his, artwork, described, by, john, carlin, in, masters, of, american, comics, as, deliberately, primitive, and, bombastic, and, elsewhere, has, been, compared, to, cubist, futurist, primitivist, and, outsider, art, his, contributions, to, the, comic, book, form, including, the, many, characters, he, created, or, co, created, and, the, many, genres, he, worked, on, have, led, to, him, being, referred, to, as, the, definitive, comic, book, artist, given, the, number, of, places, kirby, s, artwork, can, now, be, found, the, toys, based, on, his, designs, and, the, success, of, the, movies, based, upon, his, work, charles, hatfield, and, ben, saunders, said, he, was, one, of, the, chief, architects, of, the, american, imagination, he, was, regarded, as, a, hard, working, artist, and, it, has, been, calculated, that, he, drew, at, least, 20, 318, pages, of, published, art, and, a, further, 1, 385, covers, in, his, career, he, published, 1, 158, pages, in, 1962, alone, kirby, defined, comics, in, two, periods, his, work, in, the, early, 1940s, with, joe, simon, on, the, captain, america, strip, and, then, his, superhero, comics, of, the, 1960s, with, stan, lee, at, marvel, comics, and, on, his, own, at, dc, comics, kirby, also, created, stories, in, almost, every, genre, of, comics, from, the, autobiographical, street, code, to, the, apocalyptic, science, fiction, fantasy, of, kamandi, like, many, of, his, contemporaries, kirby, was, hugely, indebted, to, milton, caniff, hal, foster, and, alex, raymond, who, codified, many, of, the, tropes, of, narrative, art, in, adventure, comic, strips, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, kirby, drew, from, burne, hogarth, whose, dynamic, figure, work, may, have, informed, the, way, kirby, drew, figures, his, ferocious, bounding, and, grotesquely, articulated, figures, seem, directly, descended, from, hogarth, s, dynamically, contorted, forms, his, style, drew, on, these, influences, all, major, artists, at, the, time, kirby, was, learning, his, craft, with, caniff, foster, and, raymond, between, them, imparting, to, the, sequential, adventure, comic, strip, a, highly, illustrative, approach, based, on, realizing, the, setting, to, a, very, high, degree, where, kirby, diverged, from, these, influences, and, where, his, style, impacted, on, the, formation, of, comic, book, art, was, in, his, move, away, from, an, illustrated, approach, to, one, that, was, more, dynamic, kirby, s, artistic, style, was, one, that, captured, energy, and, motion, within, the, image, synergizing, with, the, text, and, helping, to, serve, the, narrative, in, contrast, successors, to, the, illustrative, approach, such, as, gil, kane, found, their, work, eventually, reach, an, impasse, the, art, would, illustrate, but, in, lacking, movement, caused, the, reader, to, contemplate, the, art, as, much, as, the, written, word, later, artists, such, as, bryan, hitch, and, alex, ross, combined, the, kirby, and, kane, approaches, using, highly, realistic, backgrounds, contrasted, with, dynamic, characters, to, create, what, became, known, as, a, widescreen, approach, to, comics, kirby, s, dynamism, and, energy, served, to, push, the, reader, through, the, story, where, an, illustrative, detailed, approach, would, cause, the, eye, to, linger, his, reduction, of, the, presentation, of, a, given, scene, down, to, one, that, represents, the, semblance, of, movement, has, led, kirby, to, be, described, as, cinematic, in, his, style, kirby, had, worked, at, fleischer, studios, before, coming, to, comics, and, had, a, grounding, in, animation, techniques, for, producing, motion, he, also, realized, that, comic, books, were, not, subject, to, the, same, constraints, as, the, newspaper, strip, while, other, comic, book, artists, recreated, the, layouts, that, format, used, kirby, swiftly, utilized, the, space, a, whole, comic, book, page, created, as, ron, goulart, describes, h, e, broke, up, the, pages, in, new, ways, and, introduced, splash, panels, that, stretched, across, two, pages, kirby, himself, described, the, creation, of, his, dynamic, style, as, a, reaction, both, to, the, cinema, and, to, the, urge, to, create, and, compete, i, found, myself, competing, with, the, movie, camera, i, had, to, compete, with, the, camera, i, felt, like, john, henry, i, tore, my, characters, out, of, the, panels, i, made, them, jump, all, over, the, page, i, tried, to, make, that, cohesive, so, that, it, would, be, easier, to, read, i, had, to, get, my, characters, in, extreme, positions, and, in, doing, so, i, created, an, extreme, style, which, was, recognizable, by, everybody, in, the, early, 1940s, kirby, at, times, disregarded, panel, borders, a, character, was, drawn, in, one, panel, but, their, shoulder, and, arm, would, extend, outside, the, border, into, the, gutter, and, sometimes, on, top, of, a, nearby, panel, a, character, may, be, punched, out, of, one, panel, feet, being, in, the, original, panel, and, body, in, the, next, panels, themselves, would, overlap, and, kirby, found, new, ways, to, arrange, panels, on, a, comic, book, page, his, figures, were, depicted, as, lithe, and, graceful, although, kirby, would, place, them, thrusting, from, the, page, towards, the, reader, in, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, kirby, moved, away, from, superhero, comics, and, working, with, joe, simon, worked, in, a, number, of, genres, kirby, and, simon, created, the, romance, comics, genre, and, working, in, this, as, well, as, the, war, western, and, crime, genres, saw, kirby, s, style, change, he, left, behind, the, diverse, panel, framing, and, layouts, the, nature, of, the, genres, enabled, him, to, channel, the, energy, into, the, posing, and, blocking, of, characters, forcing, the, drama, into, the, constraints, of, the, panel, when, kirby, and, stan, lee, came, together, at, marvel, comics, his, art, developed, again, his, characters, and, representations, became, more, abstract, less, anatomically, correct, he, placed, figures, across, three, planes, of, a, panel, s, depth, to, suggest, three, dimensions, his, backgrounds, were, less, detailed, where, he, did, not, want, the, eye, to, be, drawn, his, figures, moved, actively, along, diagonals, and, he, utilized, foreshortening, to, make, a, character, appear, to, recede, more, deeply, into, the, panel, so, that, they, appeared, to, move, towards, the, reader, off, the, page, during, the, 1960s, kirby, also, developed, a, talent, for, creating, collages, initially, utilizing, them, within, the, pages, of, the, fantastic, four, he, introduced, the, negative, zone, as, a, place, within, the, marvel, universe, that, would, only, be, illustrated, via, collage, however, the, reproduction, within, the, published, comics, of, the, collages, coupled, with, the, low, page, rate, he, was, being, paid, and, the, time, they, took, to, develop, saw, their, use, discarded, kirby, would, later, return, to, the, use, of, collage, in, his, fourth, world, work, at, dc, comics, here, he, used, them, most, often, in, the, pages, of, superman, s, pal, jimmy, olsen, kirby, s, style, in, the, late, 1960s, was, regarded, so, highly, by, stan, lee, that, he, instituted, it, as, marvel, s, house, style, lee, would, instruct, other, artists, to, draw, more, like, jack, and, would, also, assign, them, books, to, work, on, using, kirby, s, breakdowns, of, the, story, so, that, they, could, more, closely, hew, to, kirby, s, style, over, time, kirby, s, style, has, become, so, well, known, that, imitations, homages, and, pastiche, are, referred, to, as, kirbyesque, kirby, krackle, also, referred, to, as, kirby, dots, is, kirby, s, artistic, convention, of, depicting, the, effect, of, energy, within, the, drawing, a, field, of, black, pseudo, fractal, images, is, used, to, represent, negative, space, around, unspecified, kinds, of, energy, kirby, krackles, are, typically, used, in, illustrations, of, explosions, smoke, the, blasts, from, ray, guns, cosmic, energy, and, outer, space, phenomena, the, advanced, technology, kirby, drew, from, the, afrofuturistic, state, of, wakanda, through, the, mother, boxes, of, the, new, gods, to, the, spaceships, and, design, of, the, celestials, is, gathered, together, under, the, collective, term, kirby, tech, john, paul, leon, has, described, it, as, it, s, tech, it, s, mechanical, even, if, it, s, alien, but, it, s, drawn, in, such, an, organic, way, that, you, don, t, question, it, it, s, just, an, extension, of, his, world, i, m, not, sure, who, else, you, could, say, did, that, kirby, s, depiction, of, technology, is, linked, by, charles, hatfield, to, leo, marx, s, idea, of, the, technological, sublime, specifically, utilizing, edmund, burke, s, definition, of, the, sublime, using, this, definition, kirby, s, view, and, depiction, of, technology, is, that, of, it, as, something, to, be, feared, unlike, many, of, his, contemporaries, kirby, did, not, use, preliminary, sketches, rough, work, or, layouts, he, would, instead, start, with, the, blank, board, and, draw, the, story, onto, the, page, from, top, to, bottom, start, to, finish, many, artists, including, carmine, infantino, gil, kane, and, jim, steranko, have, remarked, on, the, unusual, nature, of, his, method, kirby, would, rarely, erase, while, working, the, art, and, therefore, the, story, would, flow, from, him, almost, fully, formed, kirby, s, pencils, had, a, reputation, for, being, detailed, to, the, point, that, they, were, difficult, to, ink, will, eisner, remembers, even, in, the, early, years, that, kirby, s, pencils, were, tight, working, for, eisner, kirby, initially, inked, with, a, pen, not, confident, enough, in, his, ability, to, use, the, japanese, brushes, lou, fine, and, eisner, preferred, by, the, time, kirby, worked, with, joe, simon, kirby, had, taught, himself, to, use, a, brush, and, would, on, occasion, ink, over, inked, work, where, he, felt, it, was, needed, due, to, the, amount, of, work, kirby, produced, it, was, rare, for, him, to, ink, his, own, work, instead, the, pencilled, pages, were, sent, on, to, an, inker, different, inkers, left, their, own, stylistic, stamp, on, the, published, version, as, kirby, noted, individual, inkers, were, suited, to, different, genres, harry, mendryk, has, suggested, that, for, a, period, in, the, 1950s, kirby, inked, himself, due, to, other, work, drying, up, by, the, late, 1960s, kirby, preferred, to, pencil, feeling, that, inking, in, itself, is, a, separate, kind, of, art, stan, lee, recalls, kirby, not, really, being, too, interested, in, who, inked, him, i, cared, much, more, about, who, inked, kirby, than, kirby, did, kirby, never, seemed, to, care, who, inked, him, i, think, kirby, felt, his, style, was, so, strong, that, it, just, didn, t, matter, who, inked, him, chic, stone, an, inker, of, kirby, s, during, the, 1960s, at, marvel, recalled, t, he, two, best, for, jack, were, mike, royer, and, steve, rude, both, truly, maintained, the, integrity, of, jack, s, pencils, the, size, of, the, art, board, made, a, difference, to, kirby, s, style, during, the, late, 1960s, the, industry, shrunk, the, size, of, the, art, board, artists, used, prior, to, 1967, art, boards, were, around, 14, x, 21, inches, being, reproduced, at, 7, x, 10, inches, after, 1967, the, size, of, the, board, shrunk, to, 10, x, 15, this, affected, the, way, kirby, drew, gil, kane, noted, that, the, amount, of, space, around, the, figures, became, less, and, less, the, figures, became, bigger, and, bigger, and, they, couldn, t, be, contained, by, a, single, panel, or, even, a, single, page, professor, craig, fischer, asserts, kirby, at, first, hated, the, new, size, fischer, argues, that, it, took, kirby, around, 18, months, to, negotiate, a, way, of, working, at, the, smaller, size, initially, he, retreated, to, a, less, detailed, close, up, style, as, seen, in, fantastic, four, 68, in, adjusting, to, the, new, size, kirby, began, utilizing, depth, to, bring, the, pages, to, life, increasing, his, use, of, foreshortening, by, the, time, kirby, had, moved, to, dc, he, started, to, incorporate, the, use, of, two, page, spreads, into, his, art, more, these, spreads, helped, define, the, mood, of, the, story, and, came, to, define, kirby, s,
