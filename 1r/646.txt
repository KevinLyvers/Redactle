with, his, mother, at, engaku, ji, in, kamakura, bears, no, name, just, the, character, mu, nothingness, ozu, is, probably, as, well, known, for, the, technical, style, and, innovation, of, his, films, as, for, the, narrative, content, the, style, of, his, films, is, most, striking, in, his, later, films, a, style, he, had, not, fully, developed, until, his, post, war, sound, films, he, did, not, conform, to, hollywood, conventions, rather, than, using, the, typical, over, the, shoulder, shots, in, his, dialogue, scenes, by, most, directors, the, camera, gazes, on, the, actors, directly, which, has, the, effect, of, placing, the, viewer, in, the, middle, of, the, scene, throughout, his, career, ozu, used, a, 50mm, lens, which, is, usually, considered, to, be, the, lens, closest, to, human, vision, ozu, did, not, use, typical, transitions, between, scenes, in, between, scenes, he, would, show, shots, of, certain, static, objects, as, transitions, or, use, direct, cuts, rather, than, fades, or, dissolves, most, often, the, static, objects, would, be, buildings, where, the, next, indoor, scene, would, take, place, it, was, during, these, transitions, that, he, would, use, music, which, might, begin, at, the, end, of, one, scene, progress, through, the, static, transition, and, fade, into, the, new, scene, he, rarely, used, non, diegetic, music, in, any, scenes, other, than, in, the, transitions, ozu, moved, the, camera, less, and, less, as, his, career, progressed, and, ceased, using, tracking, shots, altogether, in, his, colour, films, however, david, bordwell, argues, that, ozu, is, one, of, the, few, directors, to, create, a, systematic, alternative, to, hollywood, continuity, cinema, but, he, does, so, by, changing, only, a, few, premises, ozu, invented, the, tatami, shot, in, which, the, camera, is, placed, at, a, low, height, supposedly, at, the, eye, level, of, a, person, kneeling, on, a, tatami, mat, actually, ozu, s, camera, is, often, even, lower, than, that, only, one, or, two, feet, off, the, ground, which, necessitated, the, use, of, special, tripods, and, raised, sets, he, used, this, low, height, even, when, there, were, no, sitting, scenes, such, as, when, his, characters, walked, in, hallways, when, ozu, made, his, move, to, colour, he, chose, to, shoot, under, the, german, colour, process, agfacolor, as, he, felt, that, it, captured, reds, much, better, than, any, other, colour, process, ozu, eschewed, the, traditional, rules, of, movie, storytelling, most, notably, eyelines, in, his, review, of, floating, weeds, film, critic, roger, ebert, recounts, once, had, a, young, assistant, who, suggested, that, perhaps, he, should, shoot, conversations, so, that, it, seemed, to, the, audience, that, the, characters, were, looking, at, one, another, ozu, agreed, to, a, test, they, shot, a, scene, both, ways, and, compared, them, you, see, ozu, said, no, difference, ozu, was, also, an, innovator, in, japanese, narrative, structure, through, his, use, of, ellipses, or, the, decision, not, to, depict, major, events, in, the, story, in, an, autumn, afternoon, 1962, for, example, a, wedding, is, merely, mentioned, in, one, scene, and, the, next, sequence, references, this, wedding, which, has, already, occurred, the, wedding, itself, is, never, shown, this, is, typical, of, ozu, s, films, which, eschew, melodrama, by, eliding, moments, that, would, often, be, used, in, hollywood, in, attempts, to, stir, an, emotional, reaction, from, audiences, ozu, became, recognized, internationally, when, his, films, were, shown, abroad, influential, monographs, by, donald, richie, paul, schrader, and, david, bordwell, have, ensured, a, wide, appreciation, of, ozu, s, style, aesthetics, and, themes, by, the, anglophonic, audience, five, also, known, as, five, dedicated, to, ozu, is, an, iranian, documentary, film, directed, by, abbas, kiarostami, the, film, consists, of, five, long,
