masterpiece, his, epic, poem, pan, tadeusz, pan, tadeusz, his, longest, poetic, work, marked, the, end, of, his, most, productive, literary, period, mickiewicz, would, create, further, notable, works, such, as, lausanne, lyrics, 1839, 40, and, zdania, i, uwagi, thoughts, and, remarks, 1834, 40, but, neither, would, achieve, the, fame, of, his, earlier, works, his, relative, literary, silence, beginning, in, the, mid, 1830s, has, been, variously, interpreted, he, may, have, lost, his, talent, he, may, have, chosen, to, focus, on, teaching, and, on, political, writing, and, organizing, on,

of, his, work, not, a, very, profitable, endeavor, they, received, support, from, friends, and, patrons, but, not, enough, to, substantially, change, their, situation, despite, spending, most, of, his, remaining, years, in, france, mickiewicz, would, never, receive, french, citizenship, nor, any, support, from, the, french, government, by, the, late, 1830s, he, was, less, active, as, a, writer,

lecture, on, slavic, theater, was, to, become, a, kind, of, gospel, for, polish, theater, directors, of, the, twentieth, century, over, the, years, he, became, increasingly, possessed, by, religious, mysticism, as, he, fell, under, the, influence, of, the, polish, philosopher, andrzej, towia, ski, whom, he, met, in, 1841, his, lectures, became, a, medley, of, religion, and, politics, punctuated, by, controversial, attacks, on, the, catholic, church, and, thus, brought, him, under, censure, by, the, french, government, the, messianic, element, conflicted, with, roman, catholic, teachings, and, some, of, his, works, were, placed, on, the, church, s, list, of, prohibited, books, though, both, mickiewicz, and, towia, ski, regularly, attended, catholic, mass, and, encouraged, their, followers, to, do, so, in, 1846, mickiewicz, severed, his, ties, with, towia, ski, following, the, rise, of, revolutionary, sentiment, in, europe, manifested, in, events, such, as, the, krak, w, uprising, of,

political, scene, in, december, 1848, he, was, offered, a, post, at, the, jagiellonian, university, in, austrian, ruled, krak, w, but, the, offer, was, soon, withdrawn, after, pressure, from,

and, joseph, conrad, under, western, eyes, the, drama, was, first, staged, by, stanis, aw, wyspia, ski, in, 1901, becoming, in, mi, osz, s, words, a, kind, of, national, sacred, play, occasionally,

an, authority, to, the, young, insurgents, of, 1830, 31, who, expected, him, to, participate, in, the, fighting, the, poet, maurycy, gos, awski, wrote, a, dedicated, poem, urging, him, to, do, so, yet, it, is, likely, that, mickiewicz, was, no, longer, as, idealistic, and, supportive, of, military, action, as, he, had, been, a, few, years, earlier, and, his, new, works, such, as, do, matki, polki, to, a, polish, mother, 1830, while, still, patriotic, also, began, to, reflect, on, the, tragedy, of, resistance, his, meetings, with, refugees, and, escaping, insurgents, around, 1831, resulted, in, works, such, as, reduta, ordona, ordon, s, redoubt, nocleg, night, bivouac, and, mier, pu, kownika, death, of, the, colonel, wyka, notes, the, irony, that, some, of, the, most, important, literary, works, about, the, 1830, uprising, were, written, by, mickiewicz, who, never, took, part, in, a, battle, or, even, saw, a, battlefield, his, ksi, gi, narodu, polskiego, i, pielgrzymstwa, polskiego, books, of, the, polish, nation, and, the, polish, pilgrimage, 1832, opens, with, a, historical, philosophical, discussion, of, the, history, of, humankind, in, which, mickiewicz, argues, that, history, is, the, history, of, now, unrealized, freedom, that, awaits, many, oppressed, nations, in, the, future, it, is, followed, by, a, longer, moral, catechism, aimed, at, polish, migr, s, the, book, sets, out, a, messianist, metaphor, of, poland, as, the, christ, of, nations, described, by, wyka, as, a, propaganda, piece, it, was, relatively, simple, using, biblical, metaphors, and, the, like, to, reach, less, discriminating, readers, it, became, popular, not, only, among, poles, but, in, translations, among, some, other, peoples, primarily, those, which, lacked, their, own, sovereign, states, the, books, were, influential, in, framing, mickiewicz, s, image, among, many, not, as, that, of, a, poet, and, author, but, as, that, of, ideologue, of, freedom, pan, tadeusz, sir, thaddeus, published, 1834, another, of, his, masterpieces, is, an, epic, poem, that, draws, a, picture, of, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, on, the, eve, of, napoleon, s, 1812, invasion, of, russia, it, is, written, entirely, in, thirteen, syllable, couplets, originally, intended, as, an, apolitical, idyll, it, became, as, mi, osz, writes, something, unique, in, world, literature, and, the, problem, of, how, to, classify, it, has, remained, the, crux, of, a, constant, quarrel, among, scholars, it, has, been, called, the, last, epos, in, world, literature, pan, tadeusz, was, not, highly, regarded, by, contemporaries, nor, by, mickiewicz, himself, but, in, time, it, won, acclaim, as, the, highest, achievement, in, all, polish, literature, the, occasional, poems, that, mickiewicz, wrote, in, his, final, decades, have, been, described, as, exquisite, gnomic, extremely, short, and, concise, his, lausanne, lyrics, 1839, 40, are, writes, mi, osz, untranslatable, masterpieces, of, metaphysical, meditation, in, polish, literature, they, are, examples, of, that, pure, poetry, that, verges, on, silence, in, the, 1830s, as, early, as, 1830, as, late, as, 1837, he, worked, on, a, futurist, or, science, fiction, work, a, history, of, the, future, historia, przysz, o, ci, or, l, histoire, d, avenir, it, predicted, inventions, similar, to, radio, and, television, and, interplanetary, communication, using, balloons, written, partially, in, french, it, was, never, completed, and, was, partly, destroyed, by, the, author, but, parts, of, its, seven, versions, survive, other, french, language, works, by, mickiewicz, include, the, dramas, konfederaci, barscy, the, bar, confederates, and, jacques, jasi, ski, ous, les, deux, polognes, jacques, jasi, ski, or, the, two, polands, these, would, not, achieve, much, recognition, and, would, not, be, published, till, 1866, adam, mickiewicz, did, not, write, any, poems, in, lithuanian, however, it, is, known, that, mickiewicz, did, have, some, understanding, of, the, lithuanian, language, although, some, polish, commentators, describe, it, as, limited, in, the, poem, gra, yna, mickiewicz, quoted, one, sentence, from, kristijonas, donelaitis, lithuanian, language, poem, metai, in, pan, tadeusz, there, is, a, un, polonized, lithuanian, name, baublys, furthermore, due, to, mickiewicz, s, position, as, lecturer, on, lithuanian, folklore, and, mythology, in, coll, ge, de, france, it, can, be, inferred, that, he, must, have, known, the, language, sufficiently, to, lecture, about, it, it, is, known, that, adam, mickiewicz, often, sang, lithuanian, folk, songs, with, the, samogitian, ludmilew, korylski, for, example, in, the, early, 1850s, when, in, paris, mickiewicz, interrupted, a, lithuanian, folk, song, sung, by, ludmilew, korylski, commenting, that, he, was, singing, it, wrong, and, hence, wrote, down, on, a, piece, of, paper, how, to, sing, the, song, correctly, on, the, piece, of, paper, there, are, fragments, of, three, different, lithuanian, folk, songs, ejk, tatuszeli, i, bytiu, dar, a, atjo, a, nieros, par, auka, ej, warneli, jod, warneli, isz, which, are, the, sole, as, of, now, known, lithuanian, writings, by, adam, mickiewicz, the, folk, songs, are, known, to, have, been, sung, in, darb, nai, a, prime, figure, of, the, polish, romantic, period, mickiewicz, is, counted, as, one, of, poland, s, s, three, bards, the, others, being, zygmunt, krasi, ski, and, juliusz, s, owacki, and, the, greatest, poet, in, all, polish, literature, mickiewicz, has, long, been, regarded, as, poland, s, national, poet, and, is, a, revered, figure, in, lithuania, he, is, also, considered, one, of, the, greatest, slavic, and, european, poets, he, has, been, described, as, a, slavic, bard, he, was, a, leading, romantic, dramatist, and, has, been, compared, in, poland, and, in, europe, with, byron, and, goethe, mickiewicz, s, importance, extends, beyond, literature, to, the, broader, spheres, of, culture, and, politics, wyka, writes, that, he, was, a, singer, and, epic, poet, of, the, polish, people, and, a, pilgrim, for, the, freedom, of, nations, scholars, have, used, the, expression, cult, of, mickiewicz, to, describe, the, reverence, in, which, he, is, held, as, a, national, prophet, on, hearing, of, mickiewicz, s, death, his, fellow, bard, krasi, ski, wrote, for, men, of, my, generation, he, was, milk, and, honey, gall, and, life, s, blood, we, all, descend, from, him, he, carried, us, off, on, the, surging, billow, of, his, inspiration, and, cast, us, into, the, world, edward, henry, lewinski, corwin, described, mickiewicz, s, works, as, promethean, as, reaching, more, polish, hearts, than, the, other, polish, bards, and, affirmed, danish, critic, georg, brandes, assessment, of, mickiewicz, s, works, as, healthier, than, those, of, byron, shakespeare, homer, and, goethe, koropeckyi, writes, that, mickiewicz, has, informed, the, foundations, of, parties, and, ideologies, in, poland, from, the, 19th, century, to, this, day, down, to, the, rappers, in, poland, s, post, socialist, blocks, who, can, somehow, still, declare, that, if, mickiewicz, was, alive, today, he, d, be, a, good, rapper, while, mickiewicz, s, popularity, has, endured, two, centuries, in, poland, he, is, less, well, known, abroad, but, in, the, 19th, century, he, had, won, substantial, international, fame, among, people, that, dared, resist, the, brutal, might, of, reactionary, empires, mickiewicz, has, been, written, about, or, had, works, dedicated, to, him, by, many, authors, in, poland, asnyk, ga, czy, ski, iwaszkiewicz, jastrun, kasprowicz, lecho, konopnicka, teofil, lenartowicz, norwid, przybo, r,

anniversary, of, his, birth, a, towering, statue, by, cyprian, godebski, was, erected, in, warsaw, its, base, carries, the, inscription, to, the, poet, from, the, people, in, 1955, the, 100th, anniversary, of, his, death, the, university, of, pozna, adopted, him, as, its, official, patron, much, has, been, written, about, mickiewicz, though, the, vast, majority, of, this, scholarly, and, popular, literature, is, available, only, in, polish, works, devoted, to, him, according, to, koropeckyi, author, of, a, 2008, english, biography, could, fill, a, good, shelf, or, two, koropeckyi, notes, that, apart, from, some, specialist, literature, only, five, book, length, biographies, of, mickiewicz, have, been, published, in, english, he, also, writes, that, though, many, of, mickiewicz, s, works, have, been, reprinted, numerous, times, no, language, has, a, definitive, critical, edition, of, his, works, a, number, of, museums, in, europe, are, dedicated, to, mickiewicz, adam, mickiewicz, is, known, as, a, polish, poet, polish, lithuanian, lithuanian, or, belarusian, the, cambridge, history, of, russia, describes, him, as, polish, but, sees, his, ethnic, origins, as, lithuanian, belarusian, and, perhaps, jewish, some, sources, assert, that, mickiewicz, s, mother, was, descended, from, a, converted, frankist, jewish, family, others, view, this, as, improbable, polish, historian, kazimierz, wyka, in, his, biographic, entry, in, polski, s, ownik, biograficzny, 1975, wrote, that, this, hypothesis, based, on, the, fact, that, his, mother, s, maiden, name, majewska, was, popular, among, frankist, jews, but, has, not, been, proven, wyka, states, that, the, poet, s, mother, was, the, daughter, of, a, noble, szlachta, family, of, staryko, coat, of, arms, living, on, an, estate, at, czombr, w, in, nowogr, dek, voivodeship, navahrudak, voivodeship, according, to, the, belarusian, historian, rybczonek, mickiewicz, s, mother, had, tatar, lipka, tatars, roots, virgil, krapauskas, noted, that, lithuanians, like, to, prove, that, adam, mickiewicz, was, lithuanian, while, tomas, venclova, described, this, attitude, as, the, story, of, mickiewicz, s, appropriation, by, lithuanian, culture, for, example, the, lithuanian, scholar, of, literature, juozapas, girdzijauskas, writes, that, mickiewicz, s, family, was, descended, from, an, old, lithuanian, noble, family, rimvydas, with, origins, predating, lithuania, s, christianization, but, the, lithuanian, nobility, in, mickiewicz, s, time, was, heavily, polonized, and, spoke, polish, mickiewicz, had, been, brought, up, in, the, culture, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, a, multicultural, state, that, had, encompassed, most, of, what, today, are, the, separate, countries, of, poland, lithuania, belarus, and, ukraine, to, mickiewicz, a, splitting, of, that, multicultural, state, into, separate, entities, due, to, trends, such, as, lithuanian, national, revival, was, undesirable, if, not, outright, unthinkable, according, to, romanucci, ross, while, mickiewicz, called, himself, a, litvin, lithuanian, in, his, time, the, idea, of, a, separate, lithuanian, identity, apart, from, a, polish, one, did, not, exist, this, multicultural, aspect, is, evident, in, his, works, his, most, famous, poetic, work, pan, tadeusz, begins, with, the, polish, language, invocation, oh, lithuania, my, homeland, thou, art, like, health, litwo, ojczyzno, moja, ty, jeste, jak, zdrowie, it, is, generally, accepted, however, that, mickiewicz, when, referring, to, lithuania, meant, a, historical, region, rather, than, a, linguistic, and, cultural, entity, and, he, often, applied, the, term, lithuanian, to, the, slavic, inhabitants, of, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, category
