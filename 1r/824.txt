franz, uri, boas, july, 9, 1858, december, 21, 1942, was, a, german, american, anthropologist, and, a, pioneer, of, modern, anthropology, who, has, been, called, the, father, of, american, anthropology, his, work, is, associated, with, the, movements, known, as, historical, particularism, and, cultural, relativism, studying, in, germany, boas, was, awarded, a, doctorate, in, 1881, in, physics, while, also, studying, geography, he, then, participated, in, a, geographical, expedition, to, northern, canada, where, he, became, fascinated, with, the, culture, and, language, of, the, baffin, island, inuit, he, went, on, to, do, field, work, with, the, indigenous, cultures, and, languages, of, the, pacific, northwest, in, 1887, he, emigrated, to, the, united, states, where, he, first, worked, as, a, museum, curator, at, the, smithsonian, and, in, 1899, became, a, professor, of, anthropology, at, columbia, university, where, he, remained, for, the, rest, of, his, career, through, his, students, many, of, whom, went, on, to, found, anthropology, departments, and, research, programmes, inspired, by, their, mentor, boas, profoundly, influenced, the, development, of, american, anthropology, among, his, many, significant, students, were, a, l, kroeber, alexander, goldenweiser, ruth, benedict, edward, sapir, margaret, mead, zora, neale, hurston, and, gilberto, freyre, boas, was, one, of, the, most, prominent, opponents, of, the, then, popular, ideologies, of, scientific, racism, the, idea, that, race, is, a, biological, concept, and, that, human, behavior, is, best, understood, through, the, typology, of, biological, characteristics, in, a, series, of, groundbreaking, studies, of, skeletal, anatomy, he, showed, that, cranial, shape, and, size, was, highly, malleable, depending, on, environmental, factors, such, as, health, and, nutrition, in, contrast, to, the, claims, by, racial, anthropologists, of, the, day, that, held, head, shape, to, be, a, stable, racial, trait, boas, also, worked, to, demonstrate, that, differences, in, human, behavior, are, not, primarily, determined, by, innate, biological, dispositions, but, are, largely, the, result, of, cultural, differences, acquired, through, social, learning, in, this, way, boas, introduced, culture, as, the, primary, concept, for, describing, differences, in, behavior, between, human, groups, and, as, the, central, analytical, concept, of, anthropology, among, boas, s, main, contributions, to, anthropological, thought, was, his, rejection, of, the, then, popular, evolutionary, approaches, to, the, study, of, culture, which, saw, all, societies, progressing, through, a, set, of, hierarchic, technological, and, cultural, stages, with, western, european, culture, at, the, summit, boas, argued, that, culture, developed, historically, through, the, interactions, of, groups, of, people, and, the, diffusion, of, ideas, and, that, consequently, there, was, no, process, towards, continuously, higher, cultural, forms, this, insight, led, boas, to, reject, the, stage, based, organization, of, ethnological, museums, instead, preferring, to, order, items, on, display, based, on, the, affinity, and, proximity, of, the, cultural, groups, in, question, boas, also, introduced, the, idea, of, cultural, relativism, which, holds, that, cultures, cannot, be, objectively, ranked, as, higher, or, lower, or, better, or, more, correct, but, that, all, humans, see, the, world, through, the, lens, of, their, own, culture, and, judge, it, according, to, their, own, culturally, acquired, norms, for, boas, the, object, of, anthropology, was, to, understand, the, way, in, which, culture, conditioned, people, to, understand, and, interact, with, the, world, in, different, ways, and, to, do, this, it, was, necessary, to, gain, an, understanding, of, the, language, and, cultural, practices, of, the, people, studied, by, uniting, the, disciplines, of, archaeology, the, study, of, material, culture, and, history, and, physical, anthropology, the, study, of, variation, in, human, anatomy, with, ethnology, the, study, of, cultural, variation, of, customs, and, descriptive, linguistics, the, study, of, unwritten, indigenous, languages, boas, created, the, four, field, subdivision, of, anthropology, which, became, prominent, in, american, anthropology, in, the, 20th, century, franz, boas, was, born, on, july, 9, 1858, in, minden, westphalia, the, son, of, sophie, meyer, and, feibes, uri, boas, although, his, grandparents, were, observant, jews, his, parents, embraced, enlightenment, values, including, their, assimilation, into, modern, german, society, boas, s, parents, were, liberal, they, did, not, like, dogma, of, any, kind, an, important, early, influence, was, the, avuncular, abraham, jacobi, his, mother, s, brother, in, law, and, a, friend, of, karl, marx, who, was, to, advise, him, throughout, boas, s, career, due, to, this, boas, was, granted, the, independence, to, think, for, himself, and, pursue, his, own, interests, early, in, life, he, displayed, a, penchant, for, both, nature, and, natural, sciences, boas, vocally, opposed, and, refused, to, convert, to, christianity, but, he, did, not, identify, himself, as, a, religious, jew, this, is, disputed, however, by, ruth, bunzel, a, prot, g, e, of, boas, who, called, him, the, essential, protestant, he, valued, autonomy, above, all, things, according, to, his, biographer, he, was, a, jewish, german, preserving, and, promoting, german, culture, and, values, in, america, in, an, autobiographical, sketch, boas, wrote, the, background, of, my, early, thinking, was, a, german, home, in, which, the, ideals, of, the, revolution, of, 1848, were, a, living, force, my, father, liberal, but, not, active, in, public, affairs, my, mother, idealistic, with, a, lively, interest, in, public, matters, the, founder, about, 1854, of, the, kindergarten, in, my, hometown, devoted, to, science, my, parents, had, broken, through, the, shackles, of, dogma, my, father, had, retained, an, emotional, affection, for, the, ceremonial, of, his, parental, home, without, allowing, it, to, influence, his, intellectual, freedom, from, kindergarten, on, boas, was, educated, in, natural, history, a, subject, he, enjoyed, in, gymnasium, he, was, most, proud, of, his, research, on, the, geographic, distribution, of, plants, when, he, started, his, university, studies, boas, first, attended, heidelberg, university, for, a, semester, followed, by, four, terms, at, bonn, university, studying, physics, geography, and, mathematics, at, these, schools, in, 1879, he, hoped, to, transfer, to, berlin, university, to, study, physics, under, hermann, von, helmholtz, but, ended, up, transferring, to, the, university, of, kiel, instead, due, to, family, reasons, at, kiel, boas, had, wanted, to, focus, on, the, mathematical, topic, of, c, f, gauss, s, law, of, the, normal, distribution, of, errors, for, his, dissertation, but, he, ultimately, had, to, settle, for, a, topic, chosen, for, him, by, his, doctoral, advisor, physicist, gustav, karsten, on, the, optical, properties, of, water, boas, completed, his, dissertation, entitled, contributions, to, the, perception, of, the, color, of, water, which, examined, the, absorption, reflection, and, polarization, of, light, in, water, and, was, awarded, a, phd, in, physics, in, 1881, while, at, bonn, boas, had, attended, geography, classes, taught, by, the, geographer, theobald, fischer, and, the, two, established, a, friendship, with, the, coursework, and, friendship, continuing, after, both, relocated, to, kiel, at, the, same, time, fischer, a, student, of, carl, ritter, rekindled, boas, s, interest, in, geography, and, ultimately, had, more, influence, on, him, than, did, karsten, and, thus, some, biographers, view, boas, as, more, of, a, geographer, than, a, physicist, at, this, stage, in, addition, to, the, major, in, physics, adams, citing, kroeber, states, that, n, accordance, with, german, tradition, at, the, time, he, also, had, to, defend, six, minor, theses, and, boas, likely, completed, a, minor, in, geography, which, would, explain, why, fischer, was, one, of, boas, s, degree, examiners, because, of, this, close, relationship, between, fischer, and, boas, some, biographers, have, gone, so, far, as, to, incorrectly, state, that, boas, followed, fischer, to, kiel, and, that, boas, received, a, phd, in, geography, with, fischer, as, his, doctoral, advisor, for, his, part, boas, self, identified, as, a, geographer, by, the, time, he, completed, his, doctorate, prompting, his, sister, toni, to, write, in, 1883, after, long, years, of, infidelity, my, brother, was, re, conquered, by, geography, the, first, love, of, his, boyhood, in, his, dissertation, research, boas, s, methodology, included, investigating, how, different, intensities, of, light, created, different, colors, when, interacting, with, different, types, of, water, however, he, encountered, difficulty, in, being, able, to, objectively, perceive, slight, differences, in, the, color, of, water, and, as, a, result, became, intrigued, by, this, problem, of, perception, and, its, influence, on, quantitative, measurements, boas, due, to, tone, deafness, would, later, encounter, difficulties, also, in, studying, tonal, languages, such, as, laguna, boas, had, already, been, interested, in, kantian, philosophy, since, taking, a, course, on, aesthetics, with, kuno, fischer, at, heidelberg, these, factors, led, boas, to, consider, pursuing, research, in, psychophysics, which, explores, the, relationship, between, the, psychological, and, the, physical, after, completing, his, doctorate, but, he, had, no, training, in, psychology, boas, did, publish, six, articles, on, psychophysics, during, his, year, of, military, service, 1882, 1883, but, ultimately, he, decided, to, focus, on, geography, primarily, so, he, could, receive, sponsorship, for, his, planned, baffin, island, expedition, boas, took, up, geography, as, a, way, to, explore, his, growing, interest, in, the, relationship, between, subjective, experience, and, the, objective, world, at, the, time, german, geographers, were, divided, over, the, causes, of, cultural, variation, 11, many, argued, that, the, physical, environment, was, the, principal, determining, factor, but, others, notably, friedrich, ratzel, argued, that, the, diffusion, of, ideas, through, human, migration, is, more, important, in, 1883, encouraged, by, theobald, fischer, boas, went, to, baffin, island, to, conduct, geographic, research, on, the, impact, of, the, physical, environment, on, native, inuit, migrations, the, first, of, many, ethnographic, field, trips, boas, culled, his, notes, to, write, his, first, monograph, titled, the, central, eskimo, which, was, published, in, 1888, in, the, 6th, annual, report, from, the, bureau, of, american, ethnology, boas, lived, and, worked, closely, with, the, inuit, on, baffin, island, and, he, developed, an, abiding, interest, in, the, way, people, lived, in, the, perpetual, darkness, of, the, arctic, winter, boas, reported, he, and, his, traveling, companion, became, lost, and, were, forced, to, keep, sledding, for, twenty, six, hours, through, ice, soft, snow, and, temperatures, that, dropped, below, 46, c, the, following, day, boas, penciled, in, his, diary, 33, i, often, ask, myself, what, advantages, our, good, society, possesses, over, that, of, the, savages, and, find, the, more, i, see, of, their, customs, that, we, have, no, right, to, look, down, upon, them, we, have, no, right, to, blame, them, for, their, forms, and, superstitions, which, may, seem, ridiculous, to, us, we, highly, educated, people, are, much, worse, relatively, speaking, boas, went, on, to, explain, in, the, same, entry, that, all, service, therefore, which, a, man, can, perform, for, humanity, must, serve, to, promote, truth, before, his, departure, his, father, had, insisted, he, be, accompanied, by, one, of, the, family, s, servants, wilhelm, weike, who, cooked, for, him, and, kept, a, journal, of, the, expedition, boas, was, nonetheless, forced, to, depend, on, various, inuit, groups, for, everything, from, directions, and, food, to, shelter, and, companionship, it, was, a, difficult, year, filled, with, tremendous, hardships, that, included, frequent, bouts, of, disease, mistrust, pestilence, and, danger, boas, successfully, searched, for, areas, not, yet, surveyed, and, found, unique, ethnographic, objects, but, the, long, winter, and, the, lonely, treks, across, perilous, terrain, forced, him, to, search, his, soul, to, find, a, direction, for, his, life, as, a, scientist, and, a, citizen, boas, s, interest, in, indigenous, communities, grew, as, he, worked, at, the, royal, ethnological, museum, in, berlin, where, he, was, introduced, to, members, of, the, nuxalk, nation, of, british, columbia, which, sparked, a, lifelong, relationship, with, the, first, nations, of, the, pacific, northwest, he, returned, to, berlin, to, complete, his, studies, in, 1886, boas, defended, with, helmholtz, s, support, his, habilitation, thesis, baffin, land, and, was, named, privatdozent, in, geography, while, on, baffin, island, he, began, to, develop, his, interest, in, studying, non, western, cultures, resulting, in, his, book, the, central, eskimo, published, in, 1888, in, 1885, boas, went, to, work, with, physical, anthropologist, rudolf, virchow, and, ethnologist, adolf, bastian, at, the, royal, ethnological, museum, in, berlin, boas, had, studied, anatomy, with, virchow, two, years, earlier, while, preparing, for, the, baffin, island, expedition, at, the, time, virchow, was, involved, in, a, vociferous, debate, over, evolution, with, his, former, student, ernst, haeckel, haeckel, had, abandoned, his, medical, practice, to, study, comparative, anatomy, after, reading, charles, darwin, s, the, origin, of, species, and, vigorously, promoted, darwin, s, ideas, in, germany, however, like, most, other, natural, scientists, prior, to, the, rediscovery, of, mendelian, genetics, in, 1900, and, the, development, of, the, modern, synthesis, virchow, felt, that, darwin, s, theories, were, weak, because, they, lacked, a, theory, of, cellular, mutability, accordingly, virchow, favored, lamarckian, models, of, evolution, this, debate, resonated, with, debates, among, geographers, lamarckians, believed, that, environmental, forces, could, precipitate, rapid, and, enduring, changes, in, organisms, that, had, no, inherited, source, thus, lamarckians, and, environmental, determinists, often, found, themselves, on, the, same, side, of, debates, but, boas, worked, more, closely, with, bastian, who, was, noted, for, his, antipathy, to, environmental, determinism, instead, he, argued, for, the, psychic, unity, of, mankind, a, belief, that, all, humans, had, the, same, intellectual, capacity, and, that, all, cultures, were, based, on, the, same, basic, mental, principles, variations, in, custom, and, belief, he, argued, were, the, products, of, historical, accidents, this, view, resonated, with, boas, s, experiences, on, baffin, island, and, drew, him, towards, anthropology, while, at, the, royal, ethnological, museum, boas, became, interested, in, the, native, americans, in, the, pacific, northwest, and, after, defending, his, habilitation, thesis, he, left, for, a, three, month, trip, to, british, columbia, via, new, york, in, january, 1887, he, was, offered, a, job, as, assistant, editor, of, the, journal, science, alienated, by, growing, antisemitism, and, nationalism, as, well, as, the, very, limited, academic, opportunities, for, a, geographer, in, germany, boas, decided, to, stay, in, the, united, states, possibly, he, received, additional, motivation, for, this, decision, from, his, romance, with, marie, krackowizer, whom, he, married, in, the, same, year, with, a, family, underway, and, under, financial, stress, boas, also, resorted, to, pilfering, bones, and, skulls, from, native, burial, sites, to, sell, to, museums, aside, from, his, editorial, work, at, science, boas, secured, an, appointment, as, docent, in, anthropology, at, clark, university, in, 1888, boas, was, concerned, about, university, president, g, stanley, hall, s, interference, in, his, research, yet, in, 1889, he, was, appointed, as, the, head, of, a, newly, created, department, of, anthropology, at, clark, university, in, the, early, 1890s, he, went, on, a, series, of, expeditions, which, were, referred, to, as, the, morris, k, jesup, expedition, the, primary, goal, of, these, expeditions, was, to, illuminate, asiatic, american, relations, in, 1892, boas, along, with, another, member, of, the, clark, faculty, resigned, in, protest, of, the, alleged, infringement, by, hall, on, academic, freedom, anthropologist, frederic, ward, putnam, director, and, curator, of, the, peabody, museum, at, harvard, university, who, had, been, appointed, as, head, of, the, department, of, ethnology, and, archeology, for, the, chicago, fair, in, 1892, chose, boas, as, his, first, assistant, at, chicago, to, prepare, for, the, 1893, world, s, columbian, exposition, or, chicago, world, s, fair, the, 400th, anniversary, of, christopher, columbus, s, arrival, in, the, americas, boas, had, a, chance, to, apply, his, approach, to, exhibits, boas, directed, a, team, of, about, one, hundred, assistants, mandated, to, create, anthropology, and, ethnology, exhibits, on, the, indians, of, north, america, and, south, america, that, were, living, at, the, time, christopher, columbus, arrived, in, america, while, searching, for, india, putnam, intended, the, world, s, columbian, exposition, to, be, a, celebration, of, columbus, voyage, putnam, argued, that, showing, late, nineteenth, century, inuit, and, first, nations, then, called, eskimo, and, indians, in, their, natural, conditions, of, life, would, provide, a, contrast, and, celebrate, the, four, centuries, of, western, accomplishments, since, 1493, franz, boas, traveled, north, to, gather, ethnographic, material, for, the, exposition, boas, had, intended, public, science, in, creating, exhibitions, for, the, exposition, where, visitors, to, the, midway, could, learn, about, other, cultures, boas, arranged, for, fourteen, kwakwaka, wakw, aboriginals, from, british, columbia, to, come, and, reside, in, a, mock, kwakwaka, wakw, village, where, they, could, perform, their, daily, tasks, in, context, inuit, were, there, with, 12, foot, long, whips, made, of, sealskin, wearing, sealskin, clothing, and, showing, how, adept, they, were, in, sealskin, kayaks, his, experience, with, the, exposition, provided, the, first, of, a, series, of, shocks, to, franz, boas, s, faith, in, public, anthropology, the, visitors, were, not, there, to, be, educated, by, 1916, boas, had, come, to, recognize, with, a, certain, resignation, that, the, number, of, people, in, our, country, who, are, willing, and, able, to, enter, into, the, modes, of, thought, of, other, nations, is, altogether, too, small, the, american, who, is, cognizant, only, of, his, own, standpoint, sets, himself, up, as, arbiter, of, the, world, 170, after, the, exposition, the, ethnographic, material, collected, formed, the, basis, of, the, newly, created, field, museum, in, chicago, with, boas, as, the, curator, of, anthropology, he, worked, there, until, 1894, when, he, was, replaced, against, his, will, by, bae, archeologist, william, henry, holmes, in, 1896, boas, was, appointed, assistant, curator, of, ethnology, and, somatology, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, under, putnam, in, 1897, he, organized, the, jesup, north, pacific, expedition, a, five, year, long, field, study, of, the, nations, of, the, pacific, northwest, whose, ancestors, had, migrated, across, the, bering, strait, from, siberia, he, attempted, to, organize, exhibits, along, contextual, rather, than, evolutionary, lines, he, also, developed, a, research, program, in, line, with, his, curatorial, goals, describing, his, instructions, to, his, students, in, terms, of, widening, contexts, of, interpretation, within, a, society, he, explained, that, they, get, the, specimens, they, get, explanations, of, the, specimens, they, get, connected, texts, that, partly, refer, to, the, specimens, and, partly, to, abstract, things, concerning, the, people, and, they, get, grammatical, information, these, widening, contexts, of, interpretation, were, abstracted, into, one, context, the, context, in, which, the, specimens, or, assemblages, of, specimens, would, be, displayed, we, want, a, collection, arranged, according, to, tribes, in, order, to, teach, the, particular, style, of, each, group, his, approach, however, brought, him, into, conflict, with, the, president, of, the, museum, morris, jesup, and, its, director, hermon, bumpus, by, 1900, boas, had, begun, to, retreat, from, american, museum, anthropology, as, a, tool, of, education, or, reform, hinsley, 1992, 361, he, resigned, in, 1905, never, to, work, for, a, museum, again, some, scholars, like, boas, s, student, alfred, kroeber, believed, that, boas, used, his, research, in, physics, as, a, model, for, his, work, in, anthropology, many, others, however, including, boas, s, student, alexander, lesser, and, later, researchers, such, as, marian, w, smith, herbert, s, lewis, and, matti, bunzl, have, pointed, out, that, boas, explicitly, rejected, physics, in, favor, of, history, as, a, model, for, his, anthropological, research, this, distinction, between, science, and, history, has, its, origins, in, 19th, century, german, academe, which, distinguished, between, naturwissenschaften, the, sciences, and, geisteswissenschaften, the, humanities, or, between, gesetzwissenschaften, the, law, giving, sciences, and, geschichtswissenschaften, history, generally, naturwissenschaften, and, gesetzwissenschaften, refer, to, the, study, of, phenomena, that, are, governed, by, objective, natural, laws, while, the, latter, terms, in, the, two, oppositions, refer, to, those, phenomena, that, have, to, mean, only, in, terms, of, human, perception, or, experience, in, 1884, kantian, philosopher, wilhelm, windelband, coined, the, terms, nomothetic, and, idiographic, to, describe, these, two, divergent, approaches, he, observed, that, most, scientists, employ, some, mix, of, both, but, in, differing, proportions, he, considered, physics, a, perfect, example, of, a, nomothetic, science, and, history, an, idiographic, science, moreover, he, argued, that, each, approach, has, its, origin, in, one, of, the, two, interests, of, reason, kant, had, identified, in, the, critique, of, judgement, one, generalizing, the, other, specifying, winkelband, s, student, heinrich, rickert, elaborated, on, this, distinction, in, the, limits, of, concept, formation, in, natural, science, a, logical, introduction, to, the, historical, sciences, boas, s, students, alfred, kroeber, and, edward, sapir, relied, extensively, on, this, work, in, defining, their, own, approach, to, anthropology, although, kant, considered, these, two, interests, of, reason, to, be, objective, and, universal, the, distinction, between, the, natural, and, human, sciences, was, institutionalized, in, germany, through, the, organization, of, scholarly, research, and, teaching, following, the, enlightenment, in, germany, the, enlightenment, was, dominated, by, kant, himself, who, sought, to, establish, principles, based, on, universal, rationality, in, reaction, to, kant, german, scholars, such, as, johann, gottfried, herder, an, influence, to, boas, argued, that, human, creativity, which, necessarily, takes, unpredictable, and, highly, diverse, forms, is, as, important, as, human, rationality, in, 1795, the, great, linguist, and, philosopher, wilhelm, von, humboldt, called, for, an, anthropology, that, would, synthesize, kant, s, and, herder, s, interests, humboldt, founded, the, university, of, berlin, in, 1809, and, his, work, in, geography, history, and, psychology, provided, the, milieu, in, which, boas, s, intellectual, orientation, matured, historians, working, in, the, humboldtian, tradition, developed, ideas, that, would, become, central, in, boasian, anthropology, leopold, von, ranke, defined, the, task, of, the, historian, as, merely, to, show, as, it, actually, was, which, is, a, cornerstone, of, boas, s, empiricism, wilhelm, dilthey, emphasized, the, centrality, of, understanding, to, human, knowledge, and, that, the, lived, experience, of, a, historian, could, provide, a, basis, for, an, empathic, understanding, of, the, situation, of, a, historical, actor, for, boas, both, values, were, well, expressed, in, a, quote, from, goethe, a, single, action, or, event, is, interesting, not, because, it, is, explainable, but, because, it, is, true, the, influence, of, these, ideas, on, boas, is, apparent, in, his, 1887, essay, the, study, of, geography, in, which, he, distinguished, between, physical, science, which, seeks, to, discover, the, laws, governing, phenomena, and, historical, science, which, seeks, a, thorough, understanding, of, phenomena, on, their, own, terms, boas, argued, that, geography, is, and, must, be, historical, in, this, sense, in, 1887, after, his, baffin, island, expedition, boas, wrote, the, principles, of, ethnological, classification, in, which, he, developed, this, argument, in, application, to, anthropology, ethnological, phenomena, are, the, result, of, the, physical, and, psychical, character, of, men, and, of, its, development, under, the, influence, of, the, surroundings, surroundings, are, the, physical, conditions, of, the, country, and, the, sociological, phenomena, i, e, the, relation, of, man, to, man, furthermore, the, study, of, the, present, surroundings, is, insufficient, the, history, of, the, people, the, influence, of, the, regions, through, which, it, has, passed, on, its, migrations, and, the, people, with, whom, it, came, into, contact, must, be, considered, this, formulation, echoes, ratzel, s, focus, on, historical, processes, of, human, migration, and, culture, contact, and, bastian, s, rejection, of, environmental, determinism, it, also, emphasizes, culture, as, a, context, surroundings, and, the, importance, of, history, these, are, the, hallmarks, of, boasian, anthropology, which, marvin, harris, would, later, call, historical, particularism, would, guide, boas, s, research, over, the, next, decade, as, well, as, his, instructions, to, future, students, see, lewis, 2001b, for, an, alternative, view, to, harris, although, context, and, history, were, essential, elements, to, boas, s, understanding, of, anthropology, as, geisteswissenschaften, and, geschichtswissenschaften, there, is, one, essential, element, that, boasian, anthropology, shares, with, naturwissenschaften, empiricism, in, 1949, boas, s, student, alfred, kroeber, summed, up, the, three, principles, of, empiricism, that, define, boasian, anthropology, as, a, science, one, of, the, greatest, accomplishments, of, boas, and, his, students, was, their, critique, of, theories, of, physical, social, and, cultural, evolution, current, at, that, time, this, critique, is, central, to, boas, s, work, in, museums, as, well, as, his, work, in, all, four, fields, of, anthropology, as, historian, george, stocking, noted, however, boas, s, main, project, was, to, distinguish, between, biological, and, cultural, heredity, and, to, focus, on, the, cultural, processes, that, he, believed, had, the, greatest, influence, over, social, life, in, fact, boas, supported, darwinian, theory, although, he, did, not, assume, that, it, automatically, applied, to, cultural, and, historical, phenomena, and, indeed, was, a, lifelong, opponent, of, 19th, century, theories, of, cultural, evolution, such, as, those, of, lewis, h, morgan, and, edward, burnett, tylor, the, notion, of, evolution, that, the, boasians, ridiculed, and, rejected, was, the, then, dominant, belief, in, orthogenesis, a, determinate, or, teleological, process, of, evolution, in, which, change, occurs, progressively, regardless, of, natural, selection, boas, rejected, the, prevalent, theories, of, social, evolution, developed, by, edward, burnett, tylor, lewis, henry, morgan, and, herbert, spencer, not, because, he, rejected, the, notion, of, evolution, per, se, but, because, he, rejected, orthogenetic, notions, of, evolution, in, favor, of, darwinian, evolution, the, difference, between, these, prevailing, theories, of, cultural, evolution, and, darwinian, theory, cannot, be, overstated, the, orthogeneticists, argued, that, all, societies, progress, through, the, same, stages, in, the, same, sequence, thus, although, the, inuit, with, whom, boas, worked, at, baffin, island, and, the, germans, with, whom, he, studied, as, a, graduate, student, were, contemporaries, of, one, another, evolutionists, argued, that, the, inuit, were, at, an, earlier, stage, in, their, evolution, and, germans, at, a, later, stage, boasians, argued, that, virtually, every, claim, made, by, cultural, evolutionists, was, contradicted, by, the, data, or, reflected, a, profound, misinterpretation, of, the, data, as, boas, s, student, robert, lowie, remarked, contrary, to, some, misleading, statements, on, the, subject, there, have, been, no, responsible, opponents, of, evolution, as, scientifically, proved, though, there, has, been, determined, hostility, to, an, evolutionary, metaphysics, that, falsifies, the, established, facts, in, an, unpublished, lecture, boas, characterized, his, debt, to, darwin, thus, although, the, idea, does, not, appear, quite, definitely, expressed, in, darwin, s, discussion, of, the, development, of, mental, powers, it, seems, quite, clear, that, his, main, object, has, been, to, express, his, conviction, that, the, mental, faculties, developed, essentially, without, a, purposive, end, but, they, originated, as, variations, and, were, continued, by, natural, selection, this, idea, was, also, brought, out, very, clearly, by, wallace, who, emphasized, that, apparently, reasonable, activities, of, man, might, very, well, have, developed, without, an, actual, application, of, reasoning, thus, boas, suggested, that, what, appear, to, be, patterns, or, structures, in, a, culture, were, not, a, product, of, conscious, design, but, rather, the, outcome, of, diverse, mechanisms, that, produce, cultural, variation, such, as, diffusion, and, independent, invention, shaped, by, the, social, environment, in, which, people, live, and, act, boas, concluded, his, lecture, by, acknowledging, the, importance, of, darwin, s, work, i, hope, i, may, have, succeeded, in, presenting, to, you, however, imperfectly, the, currents, of, thought, due, to, the, work, of, the, immortal, darwin, which, have, helped, to, make, anthropology, what, it, is, at, the, present, time, during, maurice, fishberg, s, time, as, a, medical, examiner, he, recorded, skull, and, nose, measurements, of, jewish, immigrants, through, which, he, originally, asserted, a, genetic, difference, between, jews, and, non, jews, to, describe, them, as, another, race, along, with, joseph, jacobs, however, his, theories, were, largely, discredited, by, franz, boas, through, the, application, of, the, scientific, method, opposed, to, the, narrow, or, vertically, arranged, studies, which, maurice, fishberg, conducted, which, completely, ignored, the, jewish, ethnicity, ie, culture, religion, and, even, family, in, the, case, of, adoptions, franz, boas, looked, at, all, of, those, factors, as, well, as, across, multiple, generations, and, in, multiple, geographic, locations, to, determine, there, to, be, no, discernable, genetic, difference, between, jews, and, non, jews, this, combined, with, the, growth, of, what, max, j, kholer, called, hitlerism, or, later, nazism, in, germany, resulted, in, a, national, summit, where, franz, boas, who, had, legally, and, scientifically, been, determined, to, be, the, factually, correct, opinion, on, the, genetics, of, the, jewish, people, presided, as, guest, of, honor, as, maurice, fishberg, along, with, ellsworth, huntington, discredited, their, prior, works, before, the, judaens, and, the, jewish, academy, of, sciences, on, march, 4, 1934, to, emphatically, state, that, there, is, no, genetic, difference, between, jew, and, non, jew, nor, and, superior, race, later, this, discussion, was, distributed, by, congregation, b, nai, b, rith, in, cincinnati, ohio, in, the, late, 19th, century, anthropology, in, the, united, states, was, dominated, by, the, bureau, of, american, ethnology, directed, by, john, wesley, powell, a, geologist, who, favored, lewis, henry, morgan, s, theory, of, cultural, evolution, the, bae, was, housed, at, the, smithsonian, institution, in, washington, and, the, smithsonian, s, curator, for, ethnology, otis, t, mason, shared, powell, s, commitment, to, cultural, evolution, the, peabody, museum, at, harvard, university, was, an, important, though, lesser, center, of, anthropological, research, it, was, while, working, on, museum, collections, and, exhibitions, that, boas, formulated, his, basic, approach, to, culture, which, led, him, to, break, with, museums, and, seek, to, establish, anthropology, as, an, academic, discipline, during, this, period, boas, made, five, more, trips, to, the, pacific, northwest, his, continuing, field, research, led, him, to, think, of, culture, as, a, local, context, for, human, action, his, emphasis, on, local, context, and, history, led, him, to, oppose, the, dominant, model, at, the, time, cultural, evolution, boas, initially, broke, with, evolutionary, theory, over, the, issue, of, kinship, lewis, henry, morgan, had, argued, that, all, human, societies, move, from, an, initial, form, of, matrilineal, organization, to, patrilineal, organization, first, nations, groups, on, the, northern, coast, of, british, columbia, like, the, tsimshian, and, tlingit, were, organized, into, matrilineal, clans, first, nations, on, the, southern, coast, like, the, nootka, and, the, salish, however, were, organized, into, patrilineal, groups, boas, focused, on, the, kwakiutl, who, lived, between, the, two, clusters, the, kwakiutl, seemed, to, have, a, mix, of, features, prior, to, marriage, a, man, would, assume, his, wife, s, father, s, name, and, crest, his, children, took, on, these, names, and, crests, as, well, although, his, sons, would, lose, them, when, they, got, married, names, and, crests, thus, stayed, in, the, mother, s, line, at, first, boas, like, morgan, before, him, suggested, that, the, kwakiutl, had, been, matrilineal, like, their, neighbors, to, the, north, but, that, they, were, beginning, to, evolve, patrilineal, groups, in, 1897, however, he, repudiated, himself, and, argued, that, the, kwakiutl, were, changing, from, a, prior, patrilineal, organization, to, a, matrilineal, one, as, they, learned, about, matrilineal, principles, from, their, northern, neighbors, boas, s, rejection, of, morgan, s, theories, led, him, in, an, 1887, article, to, challenge, mason, s, principles, of, museum, display, at, stake, however, were, more, basic, issues, of, causality, and, classification, the, evolutionary, approach, to, material, culture, led, museum, curators, to, organize, objects, on, display, according, to, function, or, level, of, technological, development, curators, assumed, that, changes, in, the, forms, of, artifacts, reflect, some, natural, process, of, progressive, evolution, boas, however, felt, that, the, form, an, artifact, took, reflected, the, circumstances, under, which, it, was, produced, and, used, arguing, that, hough, like, causes, have, like, effects, like, effects, have, not, like, causes, boas, realized, that, even, artifacts, that, were, similar, in, form, might, have, developed, in, very, different, contexts, for, different, reasons, mason, s, museum, displays, organized, along, evolutionary, lines, mistakenly, juxtapose, like, effects, those, organized, along, contextual, lines, would, reveal, like, causes, in, his, capacity, as, assistant, curator, at, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, franz, boas, requested, that, arctic, explorer, robert, e, peary, bring, one, inuk, from, greenland, to, new, york, peary, obliged, and, brought, six, inuit, to, new, york, in, 1897, who, lived, in, the, basement, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, four, of, them, died, from, tuberculosis, within, a, year, of, arriving, in, new, york, one, returned, to, greenland, and, a, young, boy, minik, wallace, remained, living, in, the, museum, boas, staged, a, funeral, for, the, father, of, the, boy, and, had, the, remains, dissected, and, placed, in, the, museum, boas, has, been, widely, critiqued, for, his, role, in, bringing, the, inuit, to, new, york, and, his, disinterest, in, them, once, they, had, served, their, purpose, at, the, museum, boas, was, appointed, a, lecturer, in, physical, anthropology, at, columbia, university, in, 1896, and, promoted, to, professor, of, anthropology, in, 1899, however, the, various, anthropologists, teaching, at, columbia, had, been, assigned, to, different, departments, when, boas, left, the, museum, of, natural, history, he, negotiated, with, columbia, university, to, consolidate, the, various, professors, into, one, department, of, which, boas, would, take, charge, boas, s, program, at, columbia, was, the, first, doctor, of, philosophy, phd, program, in, anthropology, in, america, during, this, time, boas, played, a, key, role, in, organizing, the, american, anthropological, association, aaa, as, an, umbrella, organization, for, the, emerging, field, boas, originally, wanted, the, aaa, to, be, limited, to, professional, anthropologists, but, william, john, mcgee, another, geologist, who, had, joined, the, bae, under, powell, s, leadership, argued, that, the, organization, should, have, an, open, membership, mcgee, s, position, prevailed, and, he, was, elected, the, organization, s, first, president, in, 1902, boas, was, elected, a, vice, president, along, with, putnam, powell, and, holmes, at, both, columbia, and, the, aaa, boas, encouraged, the, four, field, concept, of, anthropology, he, personally, contributed, to, physical, anthropology, linguistics, archaeology, as, well, as, cultural, anthropology, his, work, in, these, fields, was, pioneering, in, physical, anthropology, he, led, scholars, away, from, static, taxonomical, classifications, of, race, to, an, emphasis, on, human, biology, and, evolution, in, linguistics, he, broke, through, the, limitations, of, classic, philology, and, established, some, of, the, central, problems, in, modern, linguistics, and, cognitive, anthropology, in, cultural, anthropology, he, along, with, the, polish, english, anthropologist, bronis, aw, malinowski, established, the, contextualist, approach, to, culture, cultural, relativism, and, the, participant, observation, method, of, fieldwork, the, four, field, approach, understood, not, merely, as, bringing, together, different, kinds, of, anthropologists, into, one, department, but, as, reconceiving, anthropology, through, the, integration, of, different, objects, of, anthropological, research, into, one, overarching, object, was, one, of, boas, s, fundamental, contributions, to, the, discipline, and, came, to, characterize, american, anthropology, against, that, of, england, france, or, germany, this, approach, defines, as, its, object, the, human, species, as, a, totality, this, focus, did, not, lead, boas, to, seek, to, reduce, all, forms, of, humanity, and, human, activity, to, some, lowest, common, denominator, rather, he, understood, the, essence, of, the, human, species, to, be, the, tremendous, variation, in, human, form, and, activity, an, approach, that, parallels, charles, darwin, s, approach, to, species, in, general, in, his, 1907, essay, anthropology, boas, identified, two, basic, questions, for, anthropologists, why, are, the, tribes, and, nations, of, the, world, different, and, how, have, the, present, differences, developed, amplifying, these, questions, he, explained, the, object, of, anthropological, study, thus, we, do, not, discuss, the, anatomical, physiological, and, mental, characteristics, of, a, man, considered, as, an, individual, but, we, are, interested, in, the, diversity, of, these, traits, in, groups, of, men, found, in, different, geographical, areas, and, in, different, social, classes, it, is, our, task, to, inquire, into, the, causes, that, have, brought, about, the, observed, differentiation, and, to, investigate, the, sequence, of, events, that, have, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, multifarious, forms, of, human, life, in, other, words, we, are, interested, in, the, anatomical, and, mental, characteristics, of, men, living, under, the, same, biological, geographical, and, social, environment, and, as, determined, by, their, past, these, questions, signal, a, marked, break, from, then, current, ideas, about, human, diversity, which, assumed, that, some, people, have, a, history, evident, in, a, historical, or, written, record, while, other, people, lacking, writing, also, lack, history, for, some, this, distinction, between, two, different, kinds, of, societies, explained, the, difference, between, history, sociology, economics, and, other, disciplines, that, focus, on, people, with, writing, and, anthropology, which, was, supposed, to, focus, on, people, without, writing, boas, rejected, this, distinction, between, kinds, of, societies, and, this, division, of, labor, in, the, academy, he, understood, all, societies, to, have, a, history, and, all, societies, to, be, proper, objects, of, the, anthropological, society, in, order, to, approach, literate, and, non, literate, societies, the, same, way, he, emphasized, the, importance, of, studying, human, history, through, the, analysis, of, other, things, besides, written, texts, thus, in, his, 1904, article, the, history, of, anthropology, boas, wrote, that, the, historical, development, of, the, work, of, anthropologists, seems, to, single, out, clearly, a, domain, of, knowledge, that, heretofore, has, not, been, treated, by, any, other, science, it, is, the, biological, history, of, mankind, in, all, its, varieties, linguistics, applied, to, people, without, written, languages, the, ethnology, of, people, without, historical, records, and, prehistoric, archeology, historians, and, social, theorists, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, had, speculated, as, to, the, causes, of, this, differentiation, but, boas, dismissed, these, theories, especially, the, dominant, theories, of, social, evolution, and, cultural, evolution, as, speculative, he, endeavored, to, establish, a, discipline, that, would, base, its, claims, on, a, rigorous, empirical, study, one, of, boas, s, most, important, books, the, mind, of, primitive, man, 1911, integrated, his, theories, concerning, the, history, and, development, of, cultures, and, established, a, program, that, would, dominate, american, anthropology, for, the, next, fifteen, years, in, this, study, he, established, that, in, any, given, population, biology, language, material, and, symbolic, culture, are, autonomous, that, each, is, an, equally, important, dimension, of, human, nature, but, that, no, one, of, these, dimensions, is, reducible, to, another, in, other, words, he, established, that, culture, does, not, depend, on, any, independent, variables, he, emphasized, that, the, biological, linguistic, and, cultural, traits, of, any, group, of, people, are, the, product, of, historical, developments, involving, both, cultural, and, non, cultural, forces, he, established, that, cultural, plurality, is, a, fundamental, feature, of, humankind, and, that, the, specific, cultural, environment, structures, much, individual, behavior, boas, also, presented, himself, as, a, role, model, for, the, citizen, scientist, who, understand, that, even, were, the, truth, pursued, as, its, own, end, all, knowledge, has, moral, consequences, the, mind, of, primitive, man, ends, with, an, appeal, to, humanism, i, hope, the, discussions, outlined, in, these, pages, have, shown, that, the, data, of, anthropology, teach, us, a, greater, tolerance, of, forms, of, civilization, different, from, our, own, that, we, should, learn, to, look, on, foreign, races, with, greater, sympathy, and, with, a, conviction, that, as, all, races, have, contributed, in, the, past, to, cultural, progress, in, one, way, or, another, so, they, will, be, capable, of, advancing, the, interests, of, mankind, if, we, are, only, willing, to, give, them, a, fair, opportunity, boas, s, work, in, physical, anthropology, brought, together, his, interest, in, darwinian, evolution, with, his, interest, in, migration, as, a, cause, of, change, his, most, important, research, in, this, field, was, his, study, of, changes, in, the, body, from, among, children, of, immigrants, in, new, york, other, researchers, had, already, noted, differences, in, height, cranial, measurements, and, other, physical, features, between, americans, and, people, from, different, parts, of, europe, many, used, these, differences, to, argue, that, there, is, an, innate, biological, difference, between, races, boas, s, primary, interest, in, symbolic, and, material, culture, and, in, language, was, the, study, of, processes, of, change, he, therefore, set, out, to, determine, whether, bodily, forms, are, also, subject, to, processes, of, change, boas, studied, 17, 821, people, divided, into, seven, ethno, national, groups, boas, found, that, average, measures, of, the, cranial, size, of, immigrants, were, significantly, different, from, members, of, these, groups, who, were, born, in, the, united, states, moreover, he, discovered, that, average, measures, of, the, cranial, size, of, children, born, within, ten, years, of, their, mothers, arrival, were, significantly, different, from, those, of, children, born, more, than, ten, years, after, their, mothers, arrival, boas, did, not, deny, that, physical, features, such, as, height, or, cranial, size, were, inherited, he, did, however, argue, that, the, environment, has, an, influence, on, these, features, which, is, expressed, through, change, over, time, this, work, was, central, to, his, influential, argument, that, differences, between, races, were, not, immutable, boas, observed, the, head, form, which, has, always, been, one, of, the, most, stable, and, permanent, characteristics, of, human, races, undergoes, far, reaching, changes, due, to, the, transfer, of, european, races, to, american, soil, the, east, european, hebrew, who, has, a, round, head, becomes, more, long, headed, the, south, italian, who, in, italy, has, an, exceedingly, long, head, becomes, more, short, headed, so, that, both, approach, a, uniform, type, in, this, country, so, far, as, the, head, is, concerned, these, findings, were, radical, at, the, time, and, continue, to, be, debated, in, 2002, the, anthropologists, corey, s, sparks, and, richard, l, jantz, claimed, that, differences, between, children, born, to, the, same, parents, in, europe, and, america, were, very, small, and, insignificant, and, that, there, was, no, detectable, effect, of, exposure, to, the, american, environment, on, the, cranial, index, in, children, they, argued, that, their, results, contradicted, boas, s, original, findings, and, demonstrated, that, they, may, no, longer, be, used, to, support, arguments, of, plasticity, in, cranial, morphology, however, jonathan, marks, a, well, known, physical, anthropologist, and, former, president, of, the, general, anthropology, section, of, the, american, anthropological, association, has, remarked, that, this, revisionist, study, of, boas, s, work, has, the, ring, of, desperation, to, it, if, not, obfuscation, and, has, been, quickly, rebutted, by, more, mainstream, biological, anthropology, in, 2003, anthropologists, clarence, c, gravlee, h, russell, bernard, and, william, r, leonard, reanalyzed, boas, s, data, and, concluded, that, most, of, boas, s, original, findings, were, correct, moreover, they, applied, new, statistical, computer, assisted, methods, to, boas, s, data, and, discovered, more, evidence, for, cranial, plasticity, in, a, later, publication, gravlee, bernard, and, leonard, reviewed, sparks, and, jantz, s, analysis, they, argue, that, sparks, and, jantz, misrepresented, boas, s, claims, and, that, sparks, s, and, jantz, s, data, actually, support, boas, for, example, they, point, out, that, sparks, and, jantz, look, at, changes, in, cranial, size, in, relation, to, how, long, an, individual, has, been, in, the, united, states, in, order, to, test, the, influence, of, the, environment, boas, however, looked, at, changes, in, cranial, size, in, relation, to, how, long, the, mother, had, been, in, the, united, states, they, argue, that, boas, s, method, is, more, useful, because, the, prenatal, environment, is, a, crucial, developmental, factor, a, further, publication, by, jantz, based, on, gravlee, et, al, claims, that, boas, had, cherry, picked, two, groups, of, immigrants, sicilians, and, hebrews, which, had, varied, most, towards, the, same, mean, and, discarded, other, groups, which, had, varied, in, the, opposite, direction, he, commented, using, the, recent, reanalysis, by, gravlee, et, al, 2003, we, can, observe, in, figure, 2, that, the, maximum, difference, in, the, cranial, index, due, to, immigration, in, hebrews, is, much, smaller, than, the, maximum, ethnic, difference, between, sicilians, and, bohemians, it, shows, that, long, headed, parents, produce, long, headed, offspring, and, vice, versa, to, make, the, argument, that, children, of, immigrants, converge, onto, an, american, type, required, boas, to, use, the, two, groups, that, changed, the, most, although, some, sociobiologists, and, evolutionary, psychologists, have, suggested, that, boas, was, opposed, to, darwinian, evolution, boas, in, fact, was, a, committed, proponent, of, darwinian, evolutionary, thought, in, 1888, he, declared, that, the, development, of, ethnology, is, largely, due, to, the, general, recognition, of, the, principle, of, biological, evolution, since, boas, s, times, physical, anthropologists, have, established, that, the, human, capacity, for, culture, is, a, product, of, human, evolution, in, fact, boas, s, research, on, changes, in, body, form, played, an, important, role, in, the, rise, of, darwinian, theory, boas, was, trained, at, a, time, when, biologists, had, no, understanding, of, genetics, mendelian, genetics, became, widely, known, only, after, 1900, prior, to, that, time, biologists, relied, on, the, measurement, of, physical, traits, as, empirical, data, for, any, theory, of, evolution, boas, s, biometric, studies, led, him, to, question, the, use, of, this, method, and, kind, of, data, in, a, speech, to, anthropologists, in, berlin, in, 1912, boas, argued, that, at, best, such, statistics, could, only, raise, biological, questions, and, not, answer, them, it, was, in, this, context, that, anthropologists, began, turning, to, genetics, as, a, basis, for, any, understanding, of, biological, variation, boas, also, contributed, greatly, to, the, foundation, of, linguistics, as, a, science, in, the, united, states, he, published, many, descriptive, studies, of, native, american, languages, wrote, on, theoretical, difficulties, in, classifying, languages, and, laid, out, a, research, program, for, studying, the, relations, between, language, and, culture, which, his, students, such, as, edward, sapir, paul, rivet, and, alfred, kroeber, followed, his, 1889, article, on, alternating, sounds, however, made, a, singular, contribution, to, the, methodology, of, both, linguistics, and, cultural, anthropology, it, is, a, response, to, a, paper, presented, in, 1888, by, daniel, garrison, brinton, at, the, time, a, professor, of, american, linguistics, and, archaeology, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, brinton, observed, that, in, the, spoken, languages, of, many, native, americans, certain, sounds, regularly, alternated, brinton, argued, that, this, pervasive, inconsistency, was, a, sign, of, linguistic, and, evolutionary, inferiority, boas, had, heard, similar, phonetic, shifts, during, his, research, in, baffin, island, and, in, the, pacific, northwest, nevertheless, he, argued, that, alternating, sounds, is, not, at, all, a, feature, of, native, american, languages, indeed, he, argued, they, do, not, really, exist, rather, than, take, alternating, sounds, as, objective, proof, of, different, stages, in, cultural, evolution, boas, considered, them, in, terms, of, his, longstanding, interest, in, the, subjective, perception, of, objective, physical, phenomena, he, also, considered, his, earlier, critique, of, evolutionary, museum, displays, there, he, pointed, out, that, two, things, artifacts, of, material, culture, that, appear, to, be, similar, may, in, fact, be, quite, different, in, this, article, he, raises, the, possibility, that, two, things, sounds, that, appear, to, be, different, may, in, fact, be, the, same, in, short, he, shifted, attention, to, the, perception, of, different, sounds, boas, begins, by, raising, an, empirical, question, when, people, describe, one, sound, in, different, ways, is, it, because, they, cannot, perceive, the, difference, or, might, there, be, another, reason, he, immediately, establishes, that, he, is, not, concerned, with, cases, involving, perceptual, deficit, the, aural, equivalent, of, color, blindness, he, points, out, that, the, question, of, people, who, describe, one, sound, in, different, ways, is, comparable, to, that, of, people, who, describe, different, sounds, in, one, way, this, is, crucial, for, research, in, descriptive, linguistics, when, studying, a, new, language, how, are, we, to, note, the, pronunciation, of, different, words, in, this, point, boas, anticipates, and, lays, the, groundwork, for, the, distinction, between, phonemics, and, phonetics, people, may, pronounce, a, word, in, a, variety, of, ways, and, still, recognize, that, they, are, using, the, same, word, the, issue, then, is, not, that, such, sensations, are, not, recognized, in, their, individuality, in, other, words, people, recognize, differences, in, pronunciations, rather, it, is, that, sounds, are, classified, according, to, their, similarity, in, other, words, that, people, classify, a, variety, of, perceived, sounds, into, one, category, a, comparable, visual, example, would, involve, words, for, colors, the, english, word, green, can, be, used, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, shades, hues, and, tints, but, there, are, some, languages, that, have, no, word, for, green, in, such, cases, people, might, classify, what, we, would, call, green, as, either, yellow, or, blue, this, is, not, an, example, of, color, blindness, people, can, perceive, differences, in, color, but, they, categorize, similar, colors, in, a, different, way, than, english, speakers, boas, applied, these, principles, to, his, studies, of, inuit, languages, researchers, have, reported, a, variety, of, spellings, for, a, given, word, in, the, past, researchers, have, interpreted, this, data, in, a, number, of, ways, it, could, indicate, local, variations, in, the, pronunciation, of, a, word, or, it, could, indicate, different, dialects, boas, argues, an, alternative, explanation, that, the, difference, is, not, in, how, inuit, pronounce, the, word, but, rather, in, how, english, speaking, scholars, perceive, the, pronunciation, of, the, word, it, is, not, that, english, speakers, are, physically, incapable, of, perceiving, the, sound, in, question, rather, the, phonetic, system, of, english, cannot, accommodate, the, perceived, sound, although, boas, was, making, a, very, specific, contribution, to, the, methods, of, descriptive, linguistics, his, ultimate, point, is, far, reaching, observer, bias, need, not, be, personal, it, can, be, cultural, in, other, words, the, perceptual, categories, of, western, researchers, may, systematically, cause, a, westerner, to, misperceive, or, to, fail, to, perceive, entirely, a, meaningful, element, in, another, culture, as, in, his, critique, of, otis, mason, s, museum, displays, boas, demonstrated, that, what, appeared, to, be, evidence, of, cultural, evolution, was, really, the, consequence, of, unscientific, methods, and, a, reflection, of, westerners, beliefs, about, their, own, cultural, superiority, this, point, provides, the, methodological, foundation, for, boas, s, cultural, relativism, elements, of, a, culture, are, meaningful, in, that, culture, s, terms, even, if, they, may, be, meaningless, or, take, on, a, radically, different, meaning, in, another, culture, the, essence, of, boas, s, approach, to, ethnography, is, found, in, his, early, essay, on, the, study, of, geography, there, he, argued, for, an, approach, that, considers, every, phenomenon, as, worthy, of, being, studied, for, its, own, sake, its, mere, existence, entitles, it, to, a, full, share, of, our, attention, and, the, knowledge, of, its, existence, and, evolution, in, space, and, time, fully, satisfies, the, student, when, boas, s, student, ruth, benedict, gave, her, presidential, address, to, the, american, anthropological, association, in, 1947, she, reminded, anthropologists, of, the, importance, of, this, idiographic, stance, by, quoting, literary, critic, a, c, bradley, we, watch, what, is, seeing, that, so, it, happened, and, must, have, happened, this, orientation, led, boas, to, promote, a, cultural, anthropology, characterized, by, a, strong, commitment, to, boas, argued, that, in, order, to, understand, what, is, in, cultural, anthropology, the, specific, cultural, traits, behaviors, beliefs, and, symbols, one, had, to, examine, them, in, their, local, context, he, also, understood, that, as, people, migrate, from, one, place, to, another, and, as, the, cultural, context, changes, over, time, the, elements, of, a, culture, and, their, meanings, will, change, which, led, him, to, emphasize, the, importance, of, local, histories, for, an, analysis, of, cultures, although, other, anthropologists, at, the, time, such, as, bronis, aw, malinowski, and, alfred, reginald, radcliffe, brown, focused, on, the, study, of, societies, which, they, understood, to, be, clearly, bounded, boas, s, attention, to, history, which, reveals, the, extent, to, which, traits, diffuse, from, one, place, to, another, led, him, to, view, cultural, boundaries, as, multiple, and, overlapping, and, as, highly, permeable, thus, boas, s, student, robert, lowie, once, described, culture, as, a, thing, of, shreds, and, patches, boas, and, his, students, understood, that, as, people, try, to, make, sense, of, their, world, they, seek, to, integrate, its, disparate, elements, with, the, result, that, different, cultures, could, be, characterized, as, having, different, configurations, or, patterns, but, boasians, also, understood, that, such, integration, was, always, in, tensions, with, diffusion, and, any, appearance, of, a, stable, configuration, is, contingent, see, bashkow, 2004, 445, during, boas, s, lifetime, as, today, many, westerners, saw, a, fundamental, difference, between, modern, societies, which, are, characterized, by, dynamism, and, individualism, and, traditional, societies, which, are, stable, and, homogeneous, boas, s, empirical, field, research, however, led, him, to, argue, against, this, comparison, for, example, his, 1903, essay, decorative, designs, of, alaskan, needlecases, a, history, of, conventional, designs, based, on, materials, in, a, u, s, museum, provides, another, example, of, how, boas, made, broad, theoretical, claims, based, on, a, detailed, analysis, of, empirical, data, after, establishing, formal, similarities, among, the, needlecases, boas, shows, how, certain, formal, features, provide, a, vocabulary, out, of, which, individual, artisans, could, create, variations, in, design, thus, his, emphasis, on, culture, as, a, context, for, meaningful, action, made, him, sensitive, to, individual, variation, within, a, society, william, henry, holmes, suggested, a, similar, point, in, an, 1886, paper, origin, and, development, of, form, and, ornament, in, ceramic, art, although, unlike, boas, he, did, not, develop, the, ethnographic, and, theoretical, implications, in, a, programmatic, essay, in, 1920, the, methods, of, ethnology, boas, argued, that, instead, of, the, systematic, enumeration, of, standardized, beliefs, and, customs, of, a, tribe, anthropology, needs, to, document, the, way, in, which, the, individual, reacts, to, his, whole, social, environment, and, to, the, difference, of, opinion, and, of, mode, of, action, that, occur, in, primitive, society, and, which, are, the, causes, of, far, reaching, changes, boas, argued, that, attention, to, individual, agency, reveals, that, the, activities, of, the, individual, are, determined, to, a, great, extent, by, his, social, environment, but, in, turn, his, own, activities, influence, the, society, in, which, he, lives, and, may, bring, about, modifications, in, a, form, consequently, boas, thought, of, culture, as, fundamentally, dynamic, as, soon, as, these, methods, are, applied, primitive, society, loses, the, appearance, of, absolute, stability, all, cultural, forms, rather, appear, in, a, constant, state, of, flux, see, lewis, 2001b, having, argued, against, the, relevance, of, the, distinction, between, literate, and, non, literate, societies, as, a, way, of, defining, anthropology, s, object, of, study, boas, argued, that, non, literate, and, literate, societies, should, be, analyzed, in, the, same, way, nineteenth, century, historians, had, been, applying, the, techniques, of, philology, to, reconstruct, the, histories, of, and, relationships, between, literate, societies, in, order, to, apply, these, methods, to, non, literate, societies, boas, argued, that, the, task, of, fieldworkers, is, to, produce, and, collect, texts, in, non, literate, societies, this, took, the, form, not, only, of, compiling, lexicons, and, grammars, of, the, local, language, but, of, recording, myths, folktales, beliefs, about, social, relationships, and, institutions, and, even, recipes, for, local, cuisine, in, order, to, do, this, boas, relied, heavily, on, the, collaboration, of, literate, native, ethnographers, among, the, kwakiutl, most, often, george, hunt, and, he, urged, his, students, to, consider, such, people, valuable, partners, inferior, in, their, standing, in, western, society, but, superior, in, their, understanding, of, their, own, culture, see, bunzl, 2004, 438, 439, using, these, methods, boas, published, another, article, in, 1920, in, which, he, revisited, his, earlier, research, on, kwakiutl, kinship, in, the, late, 1890s, boas, had, tried, to, reconstruct, transformation, in, the, organization, of, kwakiutl, clans, by, comparing, them, to, the, organization, of, clans, in, other, societies, neighboring, the, kwakiutl, to, the, north, and, south, now, however, he, argued, against, translating, the, kwakiutl, principle, of, kin, groups, into, an, english, word, instead, of, trying, to, fit, the, kwakiutl, into, some, larger, model, he, tried, to, understand, their, beliefs, and, practices, in, their, own, terms, for, example, whereas, he, had, earlier, translated, the, kwakiutl, word, numaym, as, clan, he, now, argued, that, the, word, is, best, understood, as, referring, to, a, bundle, of, privileges, for, which, there, is, no, english, word, men, secured, claims, to, these, privileges, through, their, parents, or, wives, and, there, were, a, variety, of, ways, these, privileges, could, be, acquired, used, and, transmitted, from, one, generation, to, the, next, as, in, his, work, on, alternating, sounds, boas, had, come, to, realize, that, different, ethnological, interpretations, of, kwakiutl, kinship, were, the, result, of, the, limitations, of, western, categories, as, in, his, work, on, alaskan, needlecases, he, now, saw, variation, among, kwakiutl, practices, as, the, result, of, the, play, between, social, norms, and, individual, creativity, before, his, death, in, 1942, he, appointed, helen, codere, to, edit, and, publish, his, manuscripts, about, the, culture, of, the, kwakiutl, people, franz, boas, was, an, immensely, influential, figure, throughout, the, development, of, folklore, as, a, discipline, at, first, glance, it, might, seem, that, his, only, concern, was, for, the, discipline, of, anthropology, after, all, he, fought, for, most, of, his, life, to, keep, folklore, as, a, part, of, anthropology, yet, boas, was, motivated, by, his, desire, to, see, both, anthropology, and, folklore, become, more, professional, and, well, respected, boas, was, afraid, that, if, folklore, was, allowed, to, become, its, own, discipline, the, standards, for, folklore, scholarship, would, be, lowered, this, combined, with, the, scholarships, of, amateurs, would, lead, folklore, to, be, completely, discredited, boas, believed, in, order, to, further, professionalize, folklore, boas, introduced, the, strict, scientific, methods, which, he, learned, in, college, to, the, discipline, boas, championed, the, use, of, exhaustive, research, fieldwork, and, strict, scientific, guidelines, in, folklore, scholarship, boas, believed, that, a, true, theory, could, only, be, formed, from, thorough, research, and, that, even, once, you, had, a, theory, it, should, be, treated, as, a, work, in, progress, unless, it, could, be, proved, beyond, doubt, this, rigid, scientific, methodology, was, eventually, accepted, as, one, of, the, major, tenets, of, folklore, scholarship, and, boas, s, methods, remain, in, use, even, today, boas, also, nurtured, many, budding, folklorists, during, his, time, as, a, professor, and, some, of, his, students, are, counted, among, the, most, notable, minds, in, folklore, scholarship, boas, was, passionate, about, the, collection, of, folklore, and, believed, that, the, similarity, of, folktales, amongst, different, folk, groups, was, due, to, dissemination, boas, strove, to, prove, this, theory, and, his, efforts, produced, a, method, for, breaking, a, folktale, into, parts, and, then, analyzing, these, parts, his, creation, of, catch, words, allowed, for, categorization, of, these, parts, and, the, ability, to, analyze, them, in, relation, to, other, similar, tales, boas, also, fought, to, prove, that, not, all, cultures, progressed, along, the, same, path, and, that, non, european, cultures, in, particular, were, not, primitive, but, different, boas, remained, active, in, the, development, and, scholarship, of, folklore, throughout, his, life, he, became, the, editor, of, the, journal, of, american, folklore, in, 1908, regularly, wrote, and, published, articles, on, folklore, often, in, the, journal, of, american, folklore, he, helped, to, elect, louise, pound, as, president, of, the, american, folklore, society, in, 1925, there, are, two, things, to, which, i, am, devoted, absolute, academic, and, spiritual, freedom, and, the, subordination, of, the, state, to, the, interests, of, the, individual, expressed, in, other, forms, the, furthering, of, conditions, in, which, the, individual, can, develop, to, the, best, of, his, ability, as, far, as, it, is, possible, with, a, full, understanding, of, the, fetters, imposed, upon, us, by, tradition, and, the, fight, against, all, forms, of, power, policy, of, states, or, private, organizations, this, means, a, devotion, to, principles, of, true, democracy, i, object, to, the, teaching, of, slogans, intended, to, befog, the, mind, of, whatever, kind, they, may, be, boas, was, known, for, passionately, defending, what, he, believed, to, be, right, during, his, lifetime, and, often, through, his, work, boas, combated, racism, berated, anthropologists, and, folklorists, who, used, their, work, as, a, cover, for, espionage, worked, to, protect, german, and, austrian, scientists, who, fled, the, nazi, regime, and, openly, protested, hitlerism, many, social, scientists, in, other, disciplines, often, agonize, over, the, legitimacy, of, their, work, as, science, and, consequently, emphasize, the, importance, of, detachment, objectivity, abstraction, and, quantifiability, in, their, work, perhaps, because, boas, like, other, early, anthropologists, was, originally, trained, in, the, natural, sciences, he, and, his, students, never, expressed, such, anxiety, moreover, he, did, not, believe, that, detachment, objectivity, and, quantifiability, was, required, to, make, anthropology, scientific, since, the, object, of, study, of, anthropologists, is, different, from, the, object, of, study, of, physicists, he, assumed, that, anthropologists, would, have, to, employ, different, methods, and, different, criteria, for, evaluating, their, research, thus, boas, used, statistical, studies, to, demonstrate, the, extent, to, which, variation, in, data, is, context, dependent, and, argued, that, the, context, dependent, nature, of, human, variation, rendered, many, abstractions, and, generalizations, that, had, been, passing, as, scientific, understandings, of, humankind, especially, theories, of, social, evolution, popular, at, the, time, in, fact, unscientific, his, understanding, of, ethnographic, fieldwork, began, with, the, fact, that, the, objects, of, ethnographic, study, e, g, the, inuit, of, baffin, island, were, not, just, objects, but, subjects, and, his, research, called, attention, to, their, creativity, and, agency, more, importantly, he, viewed, the, inuit, as, his, teachers, thus, reversing, the, typical, hierarchical, relationship, between, scientist, and, object, of, study, this, emphasis, on, the, relationship, between, anthropologists, and, those, they, study, the, point, that, while, astronomers, and, stars, chemists, and, elements, botanists, and, plants, are, fundamentally, different, anthropologists, and, those, they, study, are, equally, human, implied, that, anthropologists, themselves, could, be, objects, of, anthropological, study, although, boas, did, not, pursue, this, reversal, systematically, his, article, on, alternating, sounds, illustrates, his, awareness, that, scientists, should, not, be, confident, about, their, objectivity, because, they, too, see, the, world, through, the, prism, of, their, culture, this, emphasis, also, led, boas, to, conclude, that, anthropologists, have, an, obligation, to, speak, out, on, social, issues, boas, was, especially, concerned, with, racial, inequality, which, his, research, had, indicated, is, not, biological, in, origin, but, rather, social, boas, is, credited, as, the, first, scientist, to, publish, the, idea, that, all, people, including, white, and, african, americans, are, equal, he, often, emphasized, his, abhorrence, of, racism, and, used, his, work, to, show, that, there, was, no, scientific, basis, for, such, a, bias, an, early, example, of, this, concern, is, evident, in, his, 1906, commencement, address, to, atlanta, university, at, the, invitation, of, w, e, b, du, bois, boas, began, by, remarking, that, if, you, did, accept, the, view, that, the, present, weakness, of, the, american, negro, his, uncontrollable, emotions, his, lack, of, energy, are, racially, inherent, your, work, would, still, be, noble, one, he, then, went, on, however, to, argue, against, this, view, to, the, claim, that, european, and, asian, civilizations, are, at, the, time, more, advanced, than, african, societies, boas, objected, that, against, the, total, history, of, humankind, the, past, two, thousand, years, is, but, a, brief, span, moreover, although, the, technological, advances, of, our, early, ancestors, such, as, taming, fire, and, inventing, stone, tools, might, seem, insignificant, when, compared, to, the, invention, of, the, steam, engine, or, control, over, electricity, we, should, consider, that, they, might, actually, be, even, greater, accomplishments, boas, then, went, on, to, catalogue, advances, in, africa, such, as, smelting, iron, cultivating, millet, and, domesticating, chickens, and, cattle, that, occurred, in, africa, well, before, they, spread, to, europe, and, asia, evidence, now, suggests, that, chickens, were, first, domesticated, in, asia, the, original, domestication, of, cattle, is, under, debate, he, then, described, the, activities, of, african, kings, diplomats, merchants, and, artists, as, evidence, of, cultural, achievement, from, this, he, concluded, any, social, inferiority, of, negroes, in, the, united, states, cannot, be, explained, by, their, african, origins, if, therefore, it, is, claimed, that, your, race, is, doomed, to, economic, inferiority, you, may, confidently, look, to, the, home, of, your, ancestors, and, say, that, you, have, set, out, to, recover, for, the, colored, people, the, strength, that, was, their, own, before, they, set, foot, on, the, shores, of, this, continent, you, may, say, that, you, go, to, work, with, bright, hopes, and, that, you, will, not, be, discouraged, by, the, slowness, of, your, progress, for, you, have, to, recover, not, only, what, has, been, lost, in, transplanting, the, negro, race, from, its, native, soil, to, this, continent, but, you, must, reach, higher, levels, than, your, ancestors, ever, had, attained, boas, proceeds, to, discuss, the, arguments, for, the, inferiority, of, the, negro, race, and, calls, attention, to, the, fact, that, they, were, brought, to, the, americas, through, force, for, boas, this, is, just, one, example, of, the, many, times, conquest, or, colonialism, has, brought, different, peoples, into, an, unequal, relation, and, he, mentions, the, conquest, of, england, by, the, normans, the, teutonic, invasion, of, italy, the, manchu, conquest, of, china, as, resulting, in, similar, conditions, but, the, best, example, for, boas, of, this, phenomenon, is, that, of, the, jews, in, europe, even, now, there, lingers, in, the, consciousness, of, the, old, sharper, divisions, which, the, ages, had, not, been, able, to, efface, and, which, is, strong, enough, to, find, not, only, here, and, there, expression, as, antipathy, to, the, jewish, type, in, france, that, let, down, the, barriers, more, than, a, hundred, years, ago, the, feeling, of, antipathy, is, still, strong, enough, to, sustain, an, anti, jewish, political, party, boas, s, closing, advice, is, that, african, americans, should, not, look, to, whites, for, approval, or, encouragement, because, people, in, power, usually, take, a, very, long, time, to, learn, to, sympathize, with, people, out, of, power, remember, that, in, every, single, case, in, history, the, process, of, adaptation, has, been, one, of, exceeding, slowness, do, not, look, for, the, impossible, but, do, not, let, your, path, deviate, from, the, quiet, and, steadfast, insistence, on, full, opportunities, for, your, powers, despite, boas, s, caveat, about, the, intractability, of, white, prejudice, he, also, considered, it, the, scientist, s, responsibility, to, argue, against, white, myths, of, racial, purity, and, racial, superiority, and, to, use, the, evidence, of, his, research, to, fight, racism, at, the, time, boas, had, no, idea, that, speaking, at, atlanta, university, would, put, him, at, odds, with, a, different, prominent, black, figure, booker, t, washington, du, bois, and, washington, had, different, views, on, the, means, of, uplifting, black, americans, by, supporting, du, bois, boas, lost, washington, s, support, and, any, chance, of, funding, from, his, college, carnegie, mellon, university, boas, was, also, critical, of, one, nation, imposing, its, power, over, others, in, 1916, boas, wrote, a, letter, to, the, new, york, times, which, was, published, under, the, headline, why, german, americans, blame, america, although, boas, did, begin, the, letter, by, protesting, bitter, attacks, against, german, americans, at, the, time, of, the, war, in, europe, most, of, his, letter, was, a, critique, of, american, nationalism, in, my, youth, i, had, been, taught, in, school, and, at, home, not, only, to, love, the, good, of, my, own, country, but, also, to, seek, to, understand, and, to, respect, the, individualities, of, other, nations, for, this, reason, one, sided, nationalism, that, is, so, often, found, nowadays, is, to, be, unendurable, he, writes, of, his, love, for, american, ideals, of, freedom, and, of, his, growing, discomfort, with, american, beliefs, about, its, own, superiority, over, others, i, have, always, been, of, the, opinion, that, we, have, no, right, to, impose, our, ideals, upon, other, nations, no, matter, how, strange, it, may, seem, to, us, that, they, enjoy, the, kind, of, life, they, lead, how, slow, they, may, be, in, utilizing, the, resources, of, their, countries, or, how, much, opposed, their, ideas, may, be, to, ours, our, intolerant, attitude, is, most, pronounced, in, regard, to, what, we, like, to, call, our, free, institutions, modern, democracy, was, no, doubt, the, most, wholesome, and, needed, reaction, against, the, abuses, of, absolutism, and, of, a, selfish, often, corrupt, bureaucracy, that, the, wishes, and, thoughts, of, the, people, should, find, expression, and, that, the, form, of, government, should, conform, to, these, wishes, is, an, axiom, that, has, pervaded, the, whole, western, world, and, that, is, even, taking, root, in, the, far, east, it, is, a, quite, different, question, however, in, how, far, the, particular, machinery, of, democratic, government, is, identical, with, democratic, institutions, to, claim, as, we, often, do, that, our, solution, is, the, only, democratic, and, the, ideal, one, is, a, one, sided, expression, of, americanism, i, see, no, reason, why, we, should, not, allow, the, germans, austrians, and, russians, or, whoever, else, it, may, be, to, solve, their, problems, in, their, own, ways, instead, of, demanding, that, they, bestow, upon, themselves, the, benefactions, of, our, regime, although, boas, felt, that, scientists, have, a, responsibility, to, speak, out, on, social, and, political, problems, he, was, appalled, that, they, might, involve, themselves, in, disingenuous, and, deceitful, ways, thus, in, 1919, when, he, discovered, that, four, anthropologists, in, the, course, of, their, research, in, other, countries, were, serving, as, spies, for, the, american, government, he, wrote, an, angry, letter, to, the, nation, it, is, perhaps, in, this, letter, that, he, most, clearly, expresses, his, understanding, of, his, commitment, to, science, a, soldier, whose, business, is, murder, as, a, fine, art, a, diplomat, whose, calling, is, based, on, deception, and, secretiveness, a, politician, whose, very, life, consists, in, compromises, with, his, conscience, a, businessman, whose, aim, is, personal, profit, within, the, limits, allowed, by, a, lenient, law, such, may, be, excused, if, they, set, patriotic, deception, above, common, everyday, decency, and, perform, services, as, spies, they, merely, accept, the, code, of, morality, to, which, modern, society, still, conforms, not, so, the, scientist, the, very, essence, of, his, life, is, the, service, of, truth, we, all, know, scientists, who, in, private, life, do, not, come, up, to, the, standard, of, truthfulness, but, who, nevertheless, would, not, consciously, falsify, the, results, of, their, researches, it, is, bad, enough, if, we, have, to, put, up, with, these, because, they, reveal, a, lack, of, strength, of, character, that, is, liable, to, distort, the, results, of, their, work, a, person, however, who, uses, science, as, a, cover, for, political, spying, who, demeans, himself, to, pose, before, a, foreign, government, as, an, investigator, and, asks, for, assistance, in, his, alleged, researches, in, order, to, carry, on, under, this, cloak, his, political, machinations, prostitutes, science, in, an, unpardonable, way, and, forfeits, the, right, to, be, classed, as, a, scientist, although, boas, did, not, name, the, spies, in, question, he, was, referring, to, a, group, led, by, sylvanus, g, morley, who, was, affiliated, with, harvard, university, s, peabody, museum, while, conducting, research, in, mexico, morley, and, his, colleagues, looked, for, evidence, of, german, submarine, bases, and, collected, intelligence, on, mexican, political, figures, and, german, immigrants, in, mexico, boas, s, stance, against, spying, took, place, in, the, context, of, his, struggle, to, establish, a, new, model, for, academic, anthropology, at, columbia, university, previously, american, anthropology, was, based, at, the, smithsonian, institution, in, washington, and, the, peabody, museum, at, harvard, and, these, anthropologists, competed, with, boas, s, students, for, control, over, the, american, anthropological, association, and, its, flagship, publication, american, anthropologist, when, the, national, academy, of, sciences, established, the, national, research, council, in, 1916, as, a, means, by, which, scientists, could, assist, the, united, states, government, to, prepare, for, entry, into, the, war, in, europe, competition, between, the, two, groups, intensified, boas, s, rival, w, h, holmes, who, had, gotten, the, job, of, director, at, the, field, museum, for, which, boas, had, been, passed, over, 26, years, earlier, was, appointed, to, head, the, nrc, morley, was, a, prot, g, of, holmes, s, when, boas, s, letter, was, published, holmes, wrote, to, a, friend, complaining, about, the, prussian, control, of, anthropology, in, this, country, and, the, need, to, end, boas, s, hun, regime, reaction, of, holmes, and, his, allies, was, influenced, by, anti, german, and, probably, also, by, anti, jewish, sentiment, the, anthropological, society, of, washington, passed, a, resolution, condemning, boas, s, letter, for, unjustly, criticizing, president, wilson, attacking, the, principles, of, american, democracy, and, endangering, anthropologists, abroad, who, would, now, be, suspected, of, being, spies, a, charge, that, was, especially, insulting, given, that, his, concerns, about, this, very, issue, were, what, had, prompted, boas, to, write, his, letter, in, the, first, place, this, resolution, was, passed, on, to, the, american, anthropological, association, aaa, and, the, national, research, council, members, of, the, american, anthropological, association, among, whom, boas, was, a, founding, member, in, 1902, meeting, at, the, peabody, museum, of, archaeology, and, ethnology, at, harvard, with, which, morley, lothrop, and, spinden, were, affiliated, voted, by, 20, to, 10, to, censure, boas, as, a, result, boas, resigned, as, the, aaa, s, representative, to, the, nrc, although, he, remained, an, active, member, of, the, aaa, the, aaa, s, censure, of, boas, was, not, rescinded, until, 2005, boas, continued, to, speak, out, against, racism, and, for, intellectual, freedom, when, the, nazi, party, in, germany, denounced, jewish, science, which, included, not, only, boasian, anthropology, but, freudian, psychoanalysis, and, einsteinian, physics, boas, responded, with, a, public, statement, signed, by, over, 8, 000, other, scientists, declaring, that, there, is, only, one, science, to, which, race, and, religion, are, irrelevant, after, world, war, i, boas, created, the, emergency, society, for, german, and, austrian, science, this, organization, was, originally, dedicated, to, fostering, friendly, relations, between, american, and, german, and, austrian, scientists, and, for, providing, research, funding, to, german, scientists, who, had, been, adversely, affected, by, the, war, and, to, help, scientists, who, had, been, interned, with, the, rise, of, nazi, germany, boas, assisted, german, scientists, in, fleeing, the, nazi, regime, boas, helped, these, scientists, not, only, to, escape, but, to, secure, positions, once, they, arrived, additionally, boas, addressed, an, open, letter, to, paul, von, hindenburg, in, protest, against, hitlerism, he, also, wrote, an, article, in, the, american, mercury, arguing, that, there, were, no, differences, between, aryans, and, non, aryans, and, the, german, government, should, not, base, its, policies, on, such, a, false, premise, boas, and, his, students, such, as, melville, j, herskovits, opposed, the, racist, pseudoscience, developed, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, of, anthropology, human, heredity, and, eugenics, under, its, director, eugen, fischer, melville, j, herskovits, one, of, franz, boas, s, students, pointed, out, that, the, health, problems, and, social, prejudices, encountered, by, these, children, rhineland, bastards, and, their, parents, explained, what, germans, viewed, as, racial, inferiority, was, not, due, to, racial, heredity, this, provoked, polemic, invective, against, the, latter, from, fischer, the, views, of, mr, boas, are, in, part, quite, ingenious, but, in, the, field, of, heredity, mr, boas, is, by, no, means, competent, even, though, a, great, number, of, research, projects, at, the, kwi, a, which, had, picked, up, on, boas, s, studies, about, immigrants, in, new, york, had, confirmed, his, findings, including, the, study, by, walter, dornfeldt, about, eastern, european, jews, in, berlin, fischer, resorted, to, polemic, simply, because, he, had, no, arguments, to, counter, the, boasians, critique, franz, boas, died, suddenly, at, the, columbia, university, faculty, club, on, december, 21, 1942, in, the, arms, of, claude, l, vi, strauss, by, that, time, he, had, become, one, of, the, most, influential, and, respected, scientists, of, his, generation, between, 1901, and, 1911, columbia, university, produced, seven, phds, in, anthropology, although, by, today, s, standards, this, is, a, very, small, number, at, the, time, it, was, sufficient, to, establish, boas, s, anthropology, department, at, columbia, as, the, preeminent, anthropology, program, in, the, country, moreover, many, of, boas, s, students, went, on, to, establish, anthropology, programs, at, other, major, universities, boas, s, first, doctoral, student, at, columbia, was, alfred, l, kroeber, 1901, who, along, with, fellow, boas, student, robert, lowie, 1908, started, the, anthropology, program, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, he, also, trained, william, jones, 1904, one, of, the, first, native, american, indian, anthropologists, the, fox, nation, who, was, killed, while, conducting, research, in, the, philippines, in, 1909, and, albert, b, lewis, 1907, boas, also, trained, a, number, of, other, students, who, were, influential, in, the, development, of, academic, anthropology, frank, speck, 1908, who, trained, with, boas, but, received, his, phd, from, the, university, of, pennsylvania, and, immediately, proceeded, to, found, the, anthropology, department, there, edward, sapir, 1909, and, fay, cooper, cole, 1914, who, developed, the, anthropology, program, at, the, university, of, chicago, alexander, goldenweiser, 1910, who, with, elsie, clews, parsons, who, received, her, doctorate, in,

the, anthropology, program, at, the, university, of, washington, together, with, his, wife, erna, gunther, also, one, of, boas, s, students, and, melville, herskovits, 1923, who, started, the, anthropology, program, at, northwestern, university, he, also, trained, john, r, swanton, who, studied, with, boas, at, columbia, for, two, years, before, receiving, his, doctorate, from, harvard, in, 1900, paul, radin, 1911, ruth, benedict, 1923, gladys, reichard, 1925, who, had, begun, teaching, at, barnard, college, in, 1921, and, was, later, promoted, to, the, rank, of, professor, ruth, bunzel, 1929, alexander, lesser, 1929, margaret, mead, 1929, and, gene, weltfish, who, defended, her, dissertation, in, 1929, although, she, did, not, officially, graduate, until, 1950, when, columbia, reduced, the, expenses, required, to, graduate, e, adamson, hoebel, 1934, jules, henry, 1935, george, herzog, 1938, and, ashley, montagu, 1938, his, students, at, columbia, also, included, mexican, anthropologist, manuel, gamio, who, earned, his, master, of, arts, degree, after, studying, with, boas, from, 1909, to, 1911, and, became, the, founding, director, of, mexico, s, bureau, of, anthropology, in, 1917, clark, wissler, who, received, his, doctorate, in, psychology, from, columbia, university, in, 1901, but, proceeded, to, study, anthropology, with, boas, before, turning, to, research, native, americans, esther, schiff, later, goldfrank, worked, with, boas, in, the, summers, of, 1920, to, 1922, to, conduct, research, among, the, cochiti, and, laguna, pueblo, indians, in, new, mexico, gilberto, freyre, who, shaped, the, concept, of, racial, democracy, in, brazil, viola, garfield, who, carried, forth, boas, s, tsimshian, work, frederica, de, laguna, who, worked, on, the, inuit, and, the, tlingit, anthropologist, folklorist, and, novelist, zora, neale, hurston, who, graduated, from, barnard, college, the, women, s, college, associated, with, columbia, in, 1928, and, who, studied, african, american, and, afro, caribbean, folklore, and, ella, cara, deloria, who, worked, closely, with, boas, on, the, linguistics, of, native, american, languages, boas, and, his, students, were, also, an, influence, on, claude, l, vi, strauss, who, interacted, with, boas, and, the, boasians, during, his, stay, in, new, york, in, the, 1940s, several, of, boas, s, students, went, on, to, serve, as, editors, of, the, american, anthropological, association, s, flagship, journal, american, anthropologist, john, r, swanton, 1911, 1921, 1923, robert, lowie, 1924, 1933, leslie, spier, 1934, 1938, and, melville, herskovits, 1950, 1952, edward, sapir, s, student, john, alden, mason, was, editor, from, 1945, to, 1949, and, alfred, kroeber, and, robert, lowie, s, student, walter, goldschmidt, was, editor, from, 1956, to, 1959, his, last, student, marian, smith, was, president, of, the, american, anthropological, association, and, the, honorary, secretary, of, the, royal, anthropological, institute, in, london, most, of, boas, s, students, shared, his, concern, for, careful, historical, reconstruction, and, his, antipathy, towards, speculative, evolutionary, models, moreover, boas, encouraged, his, students, by, example, to, criticize, themselves, as, much, as, others, for, example, boas, originally, defended, the, cephalic, index, systematic, variations, in, head, form, as, a, method, for, describing, hereditary, traits, but, came, to, reject, his, earlier, research, after, further, study, he, similarly, came, to, criticize, his, own, early, work, in, kwakiutl, pacific, northwest, language, and, mythology, encouraged, by, this, drive, to, self, criticism, as, well, as, the, boasian, commitment, to, learn, from, one, s, informants, and, to, let, the, findings, of, one, s, research, shape, one, s, agenda, boas, s, students, quickly, diverged, from, his, own, research, agenda, several, of, his, students, soon, attempted, to, develop, theories, of, the, grand, sort, that, boas, typically, rejected, kroeber, called, his, colleagues, attention, to, sigmund, freud, and, the, potential, of, a, union, between, cultural, anthropology, and, psychoanalysis, ruth, benedict, developed, theories, of, culture, and, personality, and, national, cultures, and, kroeber, s, student, julian, steward, developed, theories, of, cultural, ecology, and, multilineal, evolution, nevertheless, boas, has, had, an, enduring, influence, on, anthropology, virtually, all, anthropologists, today, accept, boas, s, commitment, to, empiricism, and, his, methodological, cultural, relativism, moreover, virtually, all, cultural, anthropologists, today, share, boas, s, commitment, to, field, research, involving, extended, residence, learning, the, local, language, and, developing, social, relationships, with, informants, finally, anthropologists, continue, to, honor, his, critique, of, racial, ideologies, in, his, 1963, book, race, the, history, of, an, idea, in, america, thomas, gossett, wrote, that, it, is, possible, that, boas, did, more, to, combat, race, prejudice, than, any, other, person, in, history
