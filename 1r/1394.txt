the, north, for, decades, the, korean, independence, movement, was, torn, by, factionalism, and, in, fighting, and, most, of, the, leaders, of, the, independence, movement, hated, each, other, as, much, as, they, hated, the, japanese, rhee, who, had, lived, for, decades, in, the, united, states, was, a, figure, known, only, from, afar, in, korea, and, therefore, regarded, as, a, more, or, less, acceptable, compromise, candidate, for, the, conservative, factions, more, importantly, rhee, spoke, fluent, english, whereas, none, of, his, rivals, did, and, therefore, he, was, the, korean, politician, most, trusted, and, favored, by, the, american, occupation, government, the, british, diplomat, roger, makins, later, recalled, the, american, propensity, to, go, for, a, man, rather, than, a, movement, giraud, among, the, french, in, 1942, chiang, kai, shek, in, china, americans, have, always, liked, the, idea, of, dealing, with, a, foreign, leader, who, can, be, identified, as, their, man, they, are, much, less, comfortable, with, movements, makins, further, added, the, same, was, the, case, with, rhee, as, very, few, americans, were, fluent, in, korean, in, the, 1940s, or, knew, much, about, korea, and, it, was, simply, far, easier, for, the, american, occupation, government, to, deal, with, rhee, than, to, try, to, understand, korea, rhee, was, acerbic, prickly, uncompromising, and, was, regarded, by, the, us, state, department, which, long, had, dealings, with, him, as, a, dangerous, mischief, maker, but, the, american, general, john, r, hodge, decided, that, rhee, was, the, best, man, for, the, americans, to, back, because, of, his, fluent, english, and, his, ability, to, talk, with, authority, to, american, officers, about, american, subjects, once, it, became, clear, from, october, 1945, onward, that, rhee, was, the, korean, politician, most, favored, by, the, americans, other, conservative, leaders, fell, in, behind, him, when, the, first, us, soviet, cooperation, committee, meeting, was, concluded, without, a, result, he, began, to, argue, in, june, 1946, that, the, government, of, korea, must, be, established, as, an, independent, entity, in, the, same, month, he, created, a, plan, based, on, this, idea, and, moved, to, washington, dc, from, december, 1946, to, april, 1947, to, lobby, support, for, the, plan, during, the, visit, harry, s, truman, s, policies, of, containment, and, the, truman, doctrine, which, was, announced, in, march, 1947, enforced, rhee, s, anti, communist, ideas, in, november, 1947,

s, republic, of, korea, rhee, himself, had, been, an, independence, activist, and, his, relations, with, the, chinilpa, korean, elites, who, had, collaborated, with, the, japanese, were, in, the, words, of, the, south, korean, historian, kyung, moon, hwang, often, contentious, but, in, the, end, an, understanding, was, reached, in, which, in, exchange, for, their, support, rhee, would, not, purge, the, elites, in, particular, the, koreans, who, had, served, in, the, colonial, era, national, police, whom, the, americans, had, retained, after, august, 1945, were, promised, by, rhee, that,

many, of, the, leftist, opponents, were, arrested, and, in, some, cases, killed, the, most, controversial, issue, has, been, kim, ku, s, assassination, on, 26, june, 1949, kim, ku, was, assassinated, by, ahn, doo, hee, who, confessed, that, he, assassinated, kim, ku, by, the, order, of, kim, chang, ryong, the, assassin, was, described, by, the, british, historian, max, hastings, as, one, of, rhee, s, creatures, it, soon, became, apparent, that, rhee, s, style, of, government, was, rigidly, authoritarian, he, allowed, the, internal, security, force, headed, by, his, right, hand, man, kim, chang,

were, largely, due, to, the, corruption, of, the, rhee, regime, the, worst, scandal, during, the, war, indeed, of, the, entire, rhee, government, was, the, national, defense, corps, incident, rhee, created, the, national, defense, corps, in, december, 1950, intended, to, be, a, paramilitary, militia, comprising, men, not, in, the, military, or, police, who, were, drafted, into, the, corps, for, internal, security, duties, in, the, months, that, followed, tens, of, thousands, of, national, defense, corps, men, either, starved, or, froze, to, death, in, their, unheated, barracks, as, the, men, lacked, winter, uniforms, and, food, even, rhee, could, not, ignore, the, deaths, of, so, many, of, the, national, defense, corps, and, ordered, an, investigation, it, was, revealed, that, the, commander, of, the, national, defense, corps, general, kim, yun, gun, had, stolen, millions, of, american, dollars, that, were, intended, to, heat, the, barracks, and, feed, and, clothe, the, men, general, kim, and, five, other, officers, were, publicly, shot, at, daegu, on, 12, august, 1951, following, their, convictions, for, corruption, in, the, spring, of, 1951, rhee, who, was, upset, about, macarthur, s, dismissal, by, president, truman, lashed, out, in, a, press, interview, against, britain, whom, he, blamed, for, macarthur, s, sacking, rhee, was, absolutely, committed, to, reunifying, korea, under, his, leadership, and, strongly, supported, macarthur, s, call, for, going, all, out, against, china, even, at, the, risk, of, provoking, a, nuclear, war, with, the, soviet, union, rhee, declared, the, british, troops, have, outlived, their, welcome, in, my, country, shortly, after, rhee, told, an, australian, diplomat, about, the, australian, troops, fighting, for, his, country, they, are, not, wanted, here, any, longer, tell, that, to, your, government, the, australian, canadian, new, zealand, and, british, troops, all, represent, a, government, which, is, now, sabotaging, the, brave, american, effort, to, liberate, fully, and, unify, my, unhappy, nation, rhee, was, strongly, against, the, armistice, negotiations, the, us, entered, into, in, 1953, accordingly, in, april, of, the, same, year, he, demanded, of, president, eisenhower, a, total, withdrawal, of, his, troops, from, the, peninsula, if, an, armistice, were, to, be, signed, declaring, that, the, rok, would, rather, fight, on, its, own, than, negotiate, a, cease, fire, he, also, deliberately, carried, out, some, actions, that, would, deter, the, armistice, and, reignite, conflicts, in, the, region, the, most, provocative, one, being, his, unilateral, release, of, 25, 000, prisoners, of, war, in, june, 1953, such, actions, which, hindered, the, progress, of, armistice, talks, upset, china, and, the, north, moreover, for, such, unpredictability, in, his, authoritarian, leadership, the, truman, and, eisenhower, administrations, considered, him, one, of, the, rogue, allies, in, east, asia, and, engaged, in, powerplay, or, the, construction, of, asymmetric, alliances, which, helped, the, us, maximize, economic, and, political, influence, over, the, rok, and, increase, rok, s, dependency, on, the, united, states, on, 27, july, 1953, at, last, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, most, vicious, and, frustrating, wars, came, to, an, end, with, no, apparent, victor, ultimately, the, armistice, agreement, was, signed, by, military, commanders, from, china, north, korea, and, the, united, nations, command, led, by, the, us, its, signatories, did, not, include, the, rok, as, rhee, refused, to, agree, to, the, armistice, and, neither, was, it, supposed, to, be, a, permanent, cease, fire, as, a, peace, treaty, was, never, signed, because, of, widespread, discontent, with, rhee, s, corruption, and, political, repression, it, was, considered, unlikely, that, rhee, would, be, re, elected, by, the, national, assembly, to, circumvent, this, rhee, attempted, to, amend, the, constitution, to, allow, him, to, hold, elections, for, the, presidency, by, direct, popular, vote, when, the, assembly, rejected, this, amendment, rhee, ordered, a, mass, arrest, of, opposition, politicians, and, then, passed, the, desired, amendment, in, july, 1952, during, the, following, presidential, election, he, received, 74, of, the, vote, after, the, war, ended, in, july, 1953, south, korea, struggled, to, rebuild, following, nationwide, devastation, the, country, remained, at, a, third, world, level, of, development, and, was, heavily, reliant, on, us, aid, rhee, was, easily, re, elected, for, what, should, have, been, the, final, time, in, 1956, since, the, 1948, constitution, limited, the, president, to, two, consecutive, terms, however, soon, after, being, sworn, in, he, had, the, legislature, amend, the, constitution, to, allow, the, incumbent, president, to, run, for, an, unlimited, number, of, terms, despite, protests, from, the, opposition, in, march, 1960, the, 84, year, old, rhee, won, his, fourth, term, in, office, as, president, his, victory, was, assured, with, 100, of, the, vote, after, the, main, opposition, candidate, cho, byeong, ok, died, shortly, before, the, 15, march, elections, rhee, wanted, his, prot, g, lee, ki, poong, elected, as, vice, president, a, separate, office, under, korean, law, at, that, time, when, lee, who, was, running, against, chang, myon, the, ambassador, to, the, united, states, during, the, korean, war, a, member, from, the, opposition, democratic, party, won, the, vote, with, a, wide, margin, the, opposition, democratic, party, claimed, the, election, was, rigged, this, triggered, anger, among, segments, of, the, korean, populace, on, 19, april, when, police, shot, demonstrators, in, masan, the, student, led, april, revolution, forced, rhee, to, resign, on, 26, april, on, 28, april, 1960, a, dc, 4, belonging, to, the, united, states, central, intelligence,

during, the, flight, rhee, and, francesca, donner, his, austrian, wife, went, to, the, cockpit, to, thank, the, pilot, and, crew, rhee, s, wife, offered, the, pilot, a, valuable, diamond, ring, in, thanks, which, was, courteously, declined, the, former, president, his, wife, and, their, adopted, son, subsequently, lived, in, exile, in, honolulu, hawaii, rhee, died, of, stroke, complications, in, honolulu, on, 19, july, 1965, a, week, later, his, body, was, returned, to, seoul, and, buried, in, the, seoul, national, cemetery, rhee, was, married, to, seungseon, park, from, 1890, to, 1910, park, divorced, rhee, shortly, after, the, death, of, their, son, rhee, bong, su, in, 1908, supposedly, because, their, marriage, had, no, intimacy, due, to, his, political, activities, in, february, 1933, rhee, met, austrian, franziska, donner, in, geneva, at, the, time, rhee, was, participating, in, a, league, of, nations, meeting, and, donner, was, working, as, an, interpreter, in, october, 1934,

the, elder, rhee, ended, the, adoption, in, 1949, the, second, adopted, son, was, lee, kang, seok, eldest, son, of, lee, ki, poong, who, was, a, descendant, of, prince, hyoryeong, and, therefore, a, distant, cousin, of, rhee, but, lee, committed, suicide, in, 1960, after, rhee, was, exiled, rhee, in, soo, who, is, a, descendant, of, prince, yangnyeong, just, like, rhee, was, adopted, by, him, as,

honor, his, legacy, there, is, also, a, memorial, museum, located, in, hwajinpo, near, kim, il, sung, s, cottage, rhee, imbued, south, korea, with, a, legacy, of, authoritarian, rule, that, lasted, with, only, a, few, short, breaks, until, 1988, one, of, those, breaks, came, when, the, country, adopted, a, parliamentary, system, with, a, figurehead, president, in, response, to, rhee, s, abuses, this, second, republic, would, only, last, a, year, before, being, overthrown, in, a, 1961, military, coup, in, spite, of, this, however, the, ensuing, president, park, chung, hee, expressed, criticism, of, rhee, s, regime, in, particular, for, its, lack, of, focus, on, economic, and, industrial, development, beginning, with, the, park, era, the, standing, of, rhee, and, his, diplomatic, faction, of, the, korean, independence, movement, fell, in, the, public, consciousness, in, favor, of, kim, ku, and, ahn, jung, geun, who, embodied, the, armed, resistance, faction, of, the, right, wing, independence, movement, who, were, preferred, by, park, kim, s, son, kim, shin, and, ahn, s, nephew, ahn, chun, saeng, both, cooperated, with, the, park, regimes, of, the, third, and, fourth, republic, rhee, began, to, be, reevaluated, after, democratization, in, 1987, and, in, particular, came, to, be, associated, with, the, so, called, new, right, movement, some, members, of, which, have, argued, that, rhee, s, achievements, have, been, wrongly, undervalued, and, that, he, should, be, viewed, positively, as, the, founding, father, of, the, republic, of, korea, an, early, and, prominent, example, of, such, literature, was, volume, 2, of, re, understanding, the, history, of, pre, and, post, liberation, published, in, 2006, by, various, new, right, scholars, this, academic, dispute, formed, one, of, the, germs, behind, the, later, history, textbook, controversies, in, the, country, in, any, event, this, view, has, not, spread, much, beyond, the, right, wing, with, a, 2023, gallup, korea, survey, finding, that, only, 30, of, respondents, saying, that, rhee, did, many, good, things, versus, 40, who, thought, that, he, did, many, wrong, things, and, 30, who, had, no, opinion, or, didn, t, respond, moreover, only, about, half, of, conservative, party, supporters, as, well, as, half, of, self, described, conservatives, gave, the, first, response
