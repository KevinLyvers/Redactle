theoretical, construct, of, self, efficacy, and, is, also, responsible, for, the, influential, 1961, bobo, doll, experiment, this, bobo, doll, experiment, demonstrated, the, concept, of, observational, learning, where, children, would, watch, an, adult, beat, a, doll, and, as, a, result, do, the, same, a, 2002, survey, ranked, bandura, as, the, fourth, most, frequently, cited, psychologist, of, all, time, behind, b, f, skinner, sigmund, freud, and, jean, piaget, during, his, lifetime, bandura, was, widely, described, as, the, greatest, living, psychologist, and, as, one, of, the, most, influential, psychologists, of, all, time, bandura, was, born, in, mundare, alberta, an, open, town, of, roughly, four, hundred, inhabitants, as, the, youngest, child, in, a, family, of, six, the, limitations, of, education, in, a, remote, town, such, as, this, caused, bandura, to, become, independent, and, self, motivated, in, terms, of, learning, and, these, primarily, developed, traits, proved, very, helpful, in, his, lengthy, career, bandura, was, of, polish, and, ukrainian, descent, his, father, was, from, krak, w, poland, whilst, his, mother, was, from, ukraine, bandura, s, parents, were, a, key, influence, in, encouraging, him, to, seek, ventures, out, of, the, small, hamlet, they, resided, in, the, summer, after, finishing, high, school, bandura, worked, in, the, yukon, to, protect, the, alaska, highway, against, sinking, bandura, later, credited, his, work, in, the, northern, tundra, as, the, origin, of, his, interest, in, human, psychopathology, it, was, in, this, experience, in, the, yukon, where, he, was, exposed, to, a, subculture, of, drinking, and, gambling, which, helped, broaden, his, perspective, and, scope, of, views, on, life, bandura, arrived, in, the, us, in, 1949, and, was, naturalized, in, 1956, he, married, virginia, varns, 1921, 2011, in, 1952, and, they, raised, two, daughters, carol, and, mary, bandura, took, psychology, courses, in, college, and, became, passionate, about, the, subject, bandura, graduated, in, three, years, in, 1949, with, a, b, a, from, the, university, of, british, columbia, winning, the, bolocan, award, in, psychology, and, then, moved, to, the, then, epicenter, of, psychology, the, university, of, iowa, from, where, he, obtained, his, m, a, in, 1951, and, ph, d, in, clinical, psychology, in, 1952, arthur, benton, was, his, academic, adviser, at, iowa, giving, bandura, a, direct, academic, descent, from, william, james, while, clark, hull, and, kenneth, spence, were, influential, collaborators, during, his, iowa, years, bandura, came, to, support, a, style, of, psychology, that, sought, to, investigate, psychological, phenomena, through, repeatable, experimental, testing, his, inclusion, of, such, mental, phenomena, as, imagery, and, representation, and, his, concept, of, reciprocal, determinism, which, postulated, a, relationship, of, mutual, influence, between, an, agent, and, its, environment, marked, a, radical, departure, from, the, dominant, behaviorism, of, the, time, bandura, s, expanded, array, of, conceptual, tools, allowed, for, more, potent, modeling, of, such, phenomena, as, observational, learning, and, self, regulation, and, provided, psychologists, with, a, practical, way, in, which, to, theorize, about, mental, processes, in, opposition, to, the, mentalistic, constructs, of, psychoanalysis, and, personality, psychology, upon, graduation, he, completed, his, postdoctoral, internship, at, the, wichita, guidance, center, the, following, year, 1953, he, accepted, a, teaching, position, at, stanford, university, which, he, held, until, becoming, professor, emeritus, in, 2010, in, 1974, he, was, elected, president, of, the, american, psychological, association, apa, the, world, s, largest, association, of, psychologists, bandura, would, later, state, the, only, reason, he, agreed, to, be, in, the, running, for, the, apa, election, was, because, he, wanted, his, 15, minutes, of, fame, without, any, intentions, of, being, elected, he, also, worked, as, a, sports, coach, bandura, was, initially, influenced, by, robert, sears, work, on, familial, antecedents, of, social, behavior, and, identificatory, learning, and, gave, up, his, research, of, the, psychoanalytic, theory, he, directed, his, initial, research, to, the, role, of, social, modeling, in, human, motivation, thought, and, action, in, collaboration, with, richard, walters, his, first, doctoral, student, he, engaged, in, studies, of, social, learning, and, aggression, their, joint, efforts, illustrated, the, critical, role, of, modeling, in, human, behavior, and, led, to, a, program, of, research, into, the, determinants, and, mechanisms, of, observational, learning, the, initial, phase, of, bandura, s, research, analyzed, the, foundations, of, human, learning, and, the, willingness, of, children, and, adults, to, imitate, behavior, observed, in, others, in, particular, aggression, bandura, found, in, his, research, that, models, were, an, important, source, for, learning, new, behaviors, and, for, achieving, behavioral, change, in, institutionalized, settings, social, learning, theory, posits, that, there, are, three, regulatory, systems, that, control, behavior, first, the, antecedent, inducements, greatly, influence, the, time, and, response, of, behavior, the, stimulus, that, occurs, before, the, behavioral, response, must, be, appropriate, in, relation, to, social, context, and, performers, second, response, feedback, influences, also, serve, an, important, function, following, a, response, the, reinforcements, by, experience, or, observation, will, greatly, impact, the, occurrence, of, the, behavior, in, the, future, third, the, importance, of, cognitive, functions, in, social, learning, for, example, for, aggressive, behavior, to, occur, some, people, become, easily, angered, by, the, sight, or, thought, of, individuals, with, whom, they, have, had, hostile, encounters, and, this, memory, is, acquired, through, the, learning, process, social, learning, theory, became, one, of, the, theoretical, frameworks, for, entertainment, education, a, method, of, creating, socially, beneficial, entertainment, pioneered, by, miguel, sabido, bandura, and, sabido, went, on, to, forge, a, close, relationship, and, further, refine, the, theory, and, practice, his, research, with, walters, led, to, his, first, book, adolescent, aggression, in, 1959, followed, by, social, learning, and, personality, development, in, 1963, and, in, 1973, aggression, a, social, learning, analysis, during, a, period, dominated, by, behaviorism, in, the, mold, of, b, f, skinner, bandura, believed, the, sole, behavioral, modifiers, of, reward, and, punishment, in, classical, and, operant, conditioning, were, inadequate, as, a, framework, and, that, many, human, behaviors, were, learned, from, other, humans, bandura, began, to, analyze, the, means, of, treating, unduly, aggressive, children, by, identifying, sources, of, violence, in, their, lives, initial, research, in, the, area, had, begun, in, the, 1940s, under, neal, miller, and, john, dollard, his, continued, work, in, this, line, eventually, culminated, in, the, bobo, doll, experiment, which, led, to, his, 1977, treatise, social, learning, theory, many, of, his, innovations, came, from, his, focus, on, empirical, investigation, and, reproducible, investigation, contrary, to, sigmund, freud, s, popular, theories, of, psychoanalysis, in, 1974, stanford, university, awarded, him, an, endowed, chair, and, he, became, david, starr, jordan, professor, of, social, science, in, psychology, in, 1961, bandura, conducted, a, controversial, experiment, known, as, the, bobo, doll, experiment, designed, to, show, that, similar, behaviors, were, learned, by, individuals, shaping, their, own, behavior, after, the, actions, of, models, the, bobo, doll, experiment, emphasized, how, young, individuals, are, influenced, by, the, acts, of, adults, when, the, adults, were, praised, for, their, aggressive, behavior, the, children, were, more, likely, to, keep, on, hitting, the, doll, however, when, the, adults, were, punished, they, consequently, stopped, hitting, the, doll, as, well, bandura, s, results, from, this, experiment, were, widely, credited, with, helping, shift, the, focus, in, academic, psychology, from, pure, behaviorism, to, cognitive, psychology, by, the, mid, 1980s, bandura, s, research, had, taken, a, more, holistic, bent, and, his, analysis, tended, towards, giving, a, more, comprehensive, overview, of, human, cognition, in, the, context, of, social, learning, the, theory, he, expanded, from, social, learning, theory, soon, became, known, as, social, cognitive, theory, the, foundation, of, albert, bandura, s, social, learning, theory, is, the, idea, that, people, may, learn, by, seeing, and, copying, the, observable, behaviors, of, others, as, an, alternative, to, the, earlier, work, of, colleague, psychologist, b, f, skinner, who, was, well, known, for, advocating, the, behaviorist, theory, psychologists, albert, bandura, and, robert, sears, presented, the, social, learning, hypothesis, in, 1986, bandura, published, social, foundations, of, thought, and, action, a, social, cognitive, theory, in, which, he, re, conceptualized, individuals, as, self, organizing, proactive, self, reflecting, and, self, regulating, in, opposition, to, the, orthodox, conception, of, humans, as, governed, by, external, forces, he, advanced, concepts, of, triadic, reciprocal, causation, which, determined, the, connections, between, human, behavior, environmental, factors, and, personal, factors, such, as, cognitive, affective, and, biological, events, and, of, reciprocal, determinism, governing, the, causal, relations, between, such, factors, bandura, s, emphasis, on, the, capacity, of, agents, to, self, organize, and, self, regulate, would, eventually, give, rise, to, his, later, work, on, self, efficacy, while, investigating, the, processes, by, which, modeling, alleviates, phobic, disorders, in, snake, phobics, he, found, that, self, efficacy, beliefs, which, the, phobic, individuals, had, in, their, own, capabilities, to, alleviate, their, phobia, mediated, changes, in, behavior, and, in, fear, arousal, he, launched, a, major, program, of, research, examining, the, influential, role, of, self, referent, thought, in, psychological, functioning, although, he, continued, to, explore, and, write, on, theoretical, problems, relating, to, myriad, topics, from, the, late, 1970s, he, devoted, much, attention, to, exploring, the, role, of, self, efficacy, beliefs, in, human, functioning, in, 1986, he, published, social, foundations, of, thought, and, action, a, social, cognitive, theory, a, book, in, which, he, offered, a, social, cognitive, theory, of, human, functioning, that, accords, a, central, role, to, cognitive, vicarious, self, regulatory, and, self, reflective, processes, in, human, adaptation, and, change, this, theory, has, its, roots, in, an, agentic, perspective, that, views, people, as, self, organizing, proactive, self, reflecting, and, self, regulating, not, just, as, reactive, organisms, shaped, by, environmental, forces, or, driven, by, inner, impulses, his, book, self, efficacy, the, exercise, of, control, was, published, in, 1997, bandura, s, social, cognitive, theories, have, been, applied, to, education, as, well, mainly, focusing, on, self, efficacy, self, regulation, observational, learning, and, reciprocal, determinism, bandura, s, research, showed, that, high, perceived, self, efficacy, led, teachers, and, students, to, set, higher, goals, and, it, increased, the, likelihood, that, they, would, dedicate, themselves, to, those, goals, in, an, educational, setting, self, efficacy, refers, to, a, student, or, teacher, s, confidence, to, participate, in, certain, actions, that, will, help, them, achieve, distinct, goals, bandura, died, at, his, home, in, stanford, on, july, 26, 2021,
