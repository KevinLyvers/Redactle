how, bad, it, can, be, then, you, will, appreciate, capitalism, he, also, remembered, events, at, the, war, s, end, and, his, reintroduction, to, mainstream, society, when, he, was, 12, forming, friendships, with, other, children, such, as, roma, ligocka, ryszard, horowitz, and, his, family, polanski, s, fascination, with, cinema, began, very, early, when, he, was, around, age, four, or, five, he, recalls, this, period, in, an, interview, even, as, a, child, i, always, loved, cinema, and, was, thrilled, when, my, parents, would, take, me, before, the, war, then, we, were, put, into, the, ghetto, in, krak, w, and, there, was, no, cinema, but, the, germans, often, showed, newsreels, to, the, people, outside, the, ghetto, on, a, screen, in, the, market, place, and, there, was, one, particular, corner, where, you, could, see, the, screen, through, the, barbed, wire, i, remember, watching, with, fascination, although, all, they, were, showing, was, the, german, army, and, german, tanks, with, occasional, anti, jewish, slogans, inserted, on, cards, after, the, war, polanski, watched, films, either, at, school, or, at, a, local, cinema, using, whatever, pocket, money, he, had, polanski, writes, most, of, this, went, on, the, movies, but, movie, seats, were, dirt, cheap, so, a, little, went, a, long, way, i, lapped, up, every, kind, of, film, as, time, went, on, movies, became, more, than, an, escape, into, entertainment, as, he, explains, movies, were, becoming, an, absolute, obsession, with, me, i, was, enthralled, by, everything, connected, with, the, cinema, not, just, the, movies, themselves, but, the, aura, that, surrounded, them, i, loved, the, luminous, rectangle, of, the, screen, the, sight, of, the, beam, slicing, through, the, darkness, from, the, projection, booth, the, miraculous, synchronization, of, sound, and, vision, even, the, dusty, smell, of, the, tip, up, seats, more, than, anything, else, though, i, was, fascinated, by, the, actual, mechanics, of, the, process, polanski, was, above, all, influenced, by, carol, reed, s, odd, man, out, 1947, i, still, consider, it, as, one, of, the, best, movies, i, ve, ever, seen, and, a, film, which, made, me, want, to, pursue, this, career, more, than, anything, else, i, always, dreamt, of, doing, things, of, this, sort, or, that, style, to, a, certain, extent, i, must, say, that, i, somehow, perpetuate, the, ideas, of, that, movie, in, what, i, do, polanski, attended, the, national, film, school, in, d, the, third, largest, city, in, poland, in, the, 1950s, polanski, took, up,
