a, fact, which, the, nazis, who, lionised, strauss, s, music, as, so, german, later, tried, to, conceal, his, father, did, not, want, him, to, become, a, musician, but, rather, a, banker, nevertheless, strauss, jr, studied, the, violin, secretly, as, a, child, with, the, first, violinist, of, his, father, s, orchestra, franz, amon, when, his, father, discovered, his, son, secretly, practising, on, a, violin, one, day, he, gave, him, a, severe, whipping, saying, that, he, was, going, to, beat, the, music, out, of, the, boy, it, seems, that, rather, than, trying, to, avoid, a, strauss, rivalry, the, elder, strauss, only, wanted, his, son, to, escape, the, rigours, of, a, musician, s, life, it, was, only, when, the, father, abandoned, his, family, for, a, mistress, emilie, trampusch, that, the, son, was, able, to, concentrate, fully, on, a, career, as, a, composer, with, the, support, of, his, mother, strauss, studied, counterpoint, and, harmony, with, theorist,

his, small, orchestra, where, he, recruited, his, members, at, the, zur, stadt, belgrad, tavern, where, musicians, seeking, work, could, be, hired, easily, johann, strauss, i, s, influence, over, the, local, entertainment, establishments, meant, that, many, of, them, were, wary, of, offering, the, younger, strauss, a, contract, for, fear, of, angering, the, father, strauss, jr, was, able, to, persuade, dommayer, s, casino, in, hietzing, a, suburb, of, vienna, to, allow, him, to, perform, the, elder, strauss, in, anger, at, his, son, s, disobedience, and, at, that, of, the, proprietor, refused, to, ever, play, again, at, dommayer, s, casino, which, had, been, the, site, of, many, of, his, earlier, triumphs, strauss, made, his, debut, at, dommayer, s, in, october, 1844, where, he,

praise, of, strauss, s, music, a, critic, for, der, wanderer, commented, that, strauss, s, name, will, be, worthily, continued, in, his, son, children, and, children, s, children, can, look, forward, to, the, future, and, three, quarter, time, will, find, a, strong, footing, in, him, despite, the, initial, fanfare, strauss, found, his, early, years, as, a, composer, difficult, but, he, soon, won, over, audiences, after, accepting, commissions, to, perform, away, from, home, the, first, major, appointment, for, the, young, composer, was, his, award, of, the, honorary, position, of, kapellmeister, of, the, 2nd, vienna, citizen, s, regiment, which, had, been, left, vacant, following, joseph, lanner, s, death, two, years, before, vienna, was, wracked, by, the, revolutions, of, 1848, in, the, austrian, empire, and, the, intense, rivalry, between, father, and, son, became, much, more, apparent, the, son, decided, to, side, with, the, revolutionaries, it, was, a, decision, that, was, professionally, disadvantageous, as, the, austrian, royalty, twice, denied, him, the, much, coveted, position, of, kk, hofballmusikdirektor, which, was, first, designated, especially, for, johann, i, in, recognition, of, his, musical, contributions, further, the, younger, strauss, was, also, arrested, by, the, viennese, authorities, for, publicly, playing, la, marseillaise, but, was, later, acquitted, the, elder, strauss, remained, loyal, to, the, monarchy, and, composed, his, radetzky, march, op, 228, dedicated, to, the, habsburg, field, marshal, joseph, radetzky, von, radetz, which, would, become, one, of, his, best, known, compositions, when, the, elder, strauss, died, from, scarlet, fever, in, vienna, in, 1849, the, younger, strauss, merged, both, their, orchestras, and, engaged, in, further, tours, later, he, also, composed, a, number, of, patriotic, marches, dedicated, to, the, habsburg, emperor, franz, josef, i, such, as, the, kaiser, franz, josef, marsch, op, 67, and, the, kaiser, franz, josef, rettungs, jubel, marsch, op, 126, probably, to, ingratiate, himself, in, the, eyes, of, the, new, monarch, who, had, ascended, the, austrian, throne, after, the, 1848, revolution, strauss, jr, eventually, attained, greater, fame, than, his, father, and, became, one, of, the, most, popular, waltz, composers, of, the, era, extensively, touring, austria, poland, and, germany, with, his, orchestra, he, applied, for, the, position, of, kk, hofballmusikdirektor, music, director, of, the, royal, court, balls, which, he, finally, attained, in, 1863, after, being, denied, several, times, before, for, his, frequent, brushes, with, the, local, authorities, in, 1853, due, to, constant, mental, and, physical, demands, strauss, suffered, a, nervous, breakdown, he, took, a, seven, week, vacation, in, the, countryside, in, the, summer, of, that, year, on, the, advice, of, doctors, johann, s, younger, brother, josef, was, persuaded, by, his, family, to, abandon, his, career, as, an, engineer, and, take, command, of, johann, s, orchestra, in, the, interim, in, 1855, strauss, accepted, commissions, from, the, management, of, the, tsarskoye, selo, railway,

states, in, 1872, where, he, took, part, in, the, world, s, peace, jubilee, and, international, musical, festival, in, boston, at, the, invitation, of, bandmaster, patrick, gilmore, and, was, the,

to, great, acclaim, as, was, customary, at, the, time, requests, for, personal, mementos, from, celebrities, were, often, in, the, form, of, a, lock, of, hair, in, the, case, of, strauss, during, his, visit, to, america, his, valet, obliged, by, clipping, strauss, s, black, newfoundland, dog, and, providing, authentic, strauss, hair, to, adoring, female, fans, however, on, account, of, the, high, volume, of, demand, there, grew, a, fear, that, the, dog, would, be, trimmed, bald, strauss, married, the, singer, henrietta, treffz, in, 1862, and, they, remained, together, until, her, death, in,

and, especially, her, indiscretion, led, him, to, seek, a, divorce, strauss, was, not, granted, a, decree, of, annulment, by, the, roman, catholic, church, and, therefore, changed, religion, and, nationality, and, became, a, citizen, of, saxe, coburg, gotha, in, january, 1887, strauss, sought, solace, in, his, third, wife, adele, deutsch, whom, he, married, in, august, 1887, she, encouraged,

kaiser, walzer, op, 437, kaiser, jubil, um, op, 434, and, klug, gretelein, op, 462, although, strauss, was, the, most, sought, after, composer, of, dance, music, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, carl, michael, ziehrer, and, mile, waldteufel, provided, stiff, competition, the, latter, held, a, commanding, position, in, paris, also, philipp, fahrbach, denied, the, younger, strauss, the, commanding, position, of, the, kk, hofballmusikdirektor, when, the, latter, first, applied, for, the, post, the, german, operetta, composer, jacques, offenbach, who, made, his, name, in, paris,

of, the, three, took, this, drastic, precaution, after, agreeing, to, a, pact, between, himself, and, brother, josef, that, whoever, outlived, the, other, was, to, destroy, their, works, the, measure, was, intended, to, prevent, the, strauss, family, s, works, from, being, claimed, by, another, composer, this, may, also, have, been, fueled, by, strauss, s, rivalry, with, another, of, vienna, s,
