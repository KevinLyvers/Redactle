export, to, europe, in, 1896, after, consulting, with, molteno, rhodes, began, to, pay, more, attention, to, export, fruit, farming, and, bought, farms, in, groot, drakenstein, wellington, and, stellenbosch, a, year, later, he, bought, rhone, and, boschendal, and, commissioned, sir, herbert, baker, to, build, him, a, cottage, there, the, successful, operation, soon, expanded, into, rhodes, fruit, farms, and, formed, a, cornerstone, of, the, modern, day, cape, fruit, industry, in, 1873, rhodes, left, his, farm, field, in, the, care, of, his, business, partner, rudd, and, sailed, for,

second, term, at, oxford, until, 1876, he, was, greatly, influenced, by, john, ruskin, s, inaugural, lecture, at, oxford, which, reinforced, his, own, attachment, to, the, cause, of, british, imperialism, among, his, oxford, associates, were, james, rochfort, maguire, later, a, fellow, of, all, souls, college, and, a, director, of, the, british, south, africa, company, and, charles, metcalfe, due, to, his, university, career, rhodes, admired, the, oxford, tutorial, system, eventually, he, was, inspired, to, develop, his, scholarship, scheme, wherever, you, turn, your, eye, except, in, science, an, oxford, man, is, at, the, top, of, the, tree, while, attending, oriel, college, rhodes, became, a, freemason, in, the, apollo, university, lodge, although, initially, he, did, not, approve, of, the, organisation, he, continued, to, be, a, south, african, freemason, until, his, death, in, 1902, the, shortcomings, of, the, freemasons, in, his, opinion, later, caused, him, to, envisage, his, own, secret, society, with, the, goal, of, bringing, the, entire, world, under, british, rule, during, his, years, at, oxford, rhodes, continued, to, prosper, in, kimberley, before, his, departure, for, oxford, he, and, c, d, rudd, had, moved, from, the, kimberley, mine, to, invest, in, the, more, costly, claims, of, what, was, known, as, old, de, beers, vooruitzicht, it, was, named, after, johannes, nicolaas, de, beer, and, his, brother, diederik, arnoldus, who, occupied, the, farm, after, purchasing, the, land, in, 1839, from, david, danser, a, koranna, chief, in, the, area, david, stephanus, fourie, forebear, of, claudine, fourie, grosvenor, had, allowed, the, de, beers, and, various, other, afrikaner, families, to, cultivate, the, land, the, region, extended, from, the, modder, river, via, the, vet, river, up, to, the, vaal, river, in, 1874, and, 1875, the, diamond, fields, were, in, the, grip, of, depression, but, rhodes, and, rudd, were, among, those, who, stayed, to, consolidate, their, interests, they, believed, that, diamonds, would, be, numerous, in, the, hard, blue, ground, that, had, been, exposed, after, the, softer, yellow, layer, near, the, surface, had, been, worked, out, during, this, time, the, technical, problem, of, clearing, out, the, water, that, was, flooding, the, mines, became, serious, rhodes, and, rudd, obtained, the, contract, for, pumping, water, out, of, the, three, main, mines, after, rhodes, returned, from, his, first, term, at, oxford, he, lived, with, robert, dundas, graham, who, later, became, a, mining, partner, with, rudd, and, rhodes, on, 13, march, 1888, rhodes, and, rudd, launched, de, beers, consolidated, mines, after, the, amalgamation, of, a, number, of, individual, claims, with, 200, 000, of, capital, the, company, of, which, rhodes, was, secretary, owned, the, largest, interest, in, the, mine, 200, 000, in, 1880, 22, 5m, in, 2020, 28, 5m, usd, rhodes, was, named, the, chairman, of, de, beers, at, the, company, s, founding, in, 1888, de, beers, was, established, with, funding, from, n, m, rothschild, sons, in, 1887, in, 1880, rhodes, prepared, to, enter, public, life, at, the, cape, with, the, earlier, incorporation, of, griqualand, west, into, the, cape, colony, under, the, molteno, ministry, in, 1877, the, area, had, obtained, six, seats, in, the, cape, house, of, assembly, rhodes, chose, the, rural, and, predominately, boer, constituency, of, barkly, west, which, would, remain, loyal, to, rhodes, until, his, death, when, rhodes, became, a, member, of, the, cape, parliament, the, chief, goal, of, the, assembly, was, to, help, decide, the, future, of, basutoland, the, ministry, of, sir, gordon, sprigg, was, trying, to, restore, order, after, the, 1880, rebellion, known, as, the, gun, war, the, sprigg, ministry, had, precipitated, the, revolt, by, applying, its, policy, of, disarming, all, native, africans, to, those, of, the, basotho, nation, who, resisted, in, 1890, rhodes, became, prime, minister, of, the, cape, colony, he, introduced, various, acts, of, parliament, to, push, black, people, from, their, lands, and, make, way, for, industrial, development, rhodes, s, view, was, that, black, people, needed, to, be, driven, off, their, land, to, stimulate, them, to, labour, and, to, change, their, habits, it, must, be, brought, home, to, them, rhodes, said, that, in, future, nine, tenths, of, them, will, have, to, spend, their, lives, in, manual, labour, and, the, sooner, that, is, brought, home, to, them, the, better, in, 1892, rhodes, s, franchise, and, ballot, act, raised, the, property, requirements, from, a, relatively, low, 25, to, a, significantly, higher, 75, which, had, a, disproportionate, effect, on, the, previously, growing, number, of, enfranchised, black, people, in, the, cape, under, the, cape, qualified, franchise, that, had, been, in, force, since, 1853, by, limiting, the, amount, of, land, which, black, africans, were, legally, allowed, to, hold, in, the, glen, grey, act, of, 1894, rhodes, further, disenfranchised, the, black, population, to, quote, richard, dowden, most, would, now, find, it, almost, impossible, to, get, back, on, the, list, because, of, the, legal, limit, on, the, amount, of, land, they, could, hold, in, addition, rhodes, was, an, early, architect, of, the, natives, land, act, 1913, which, would, limit, the, areas, of, the, country, where, black, africans, were, allowed, to, settle, to, less, than, 10, at, the, time, rhodes, would, argue, that, the, native, is, to, be, treated, as, a, child, and, denied, the, franchise, we, must, adopt, a, system, of, despotism, such, as, works, in, india, in, our, relations, with, the, barbarism, of, south, africa, rhodes, also, introduced, educational, reform, to, the, area, his, policies, were, instrumental, in, the, development, of, british, imperial, policies, in, south, africa, such, as, the, hut, tax, rhodes, did, not, however, have, direct, political, power, over, the, independent, boer, republic, of, the, transvaal, he, often, disagreed, with, the, transvaal, government, s, policies, which, he, considered, unsupportive, of, mine, owners, interests, in, 1895, believing, he, could, use, his, influence, to, overthrow, the, boer, government, rhodes, supported, the, jameson, raid, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, create, an, uprising, in, the, transvaal, that, had, the, tacit, approval, of, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, joseph, chamberlain, the, raid, was, a, catastrophic, failure, it, forced, cecil, rhodes, to, resign, as, prime, minister, of, the, cape, colony, sent, his, oldest, brother, col, frank, rhodes, to, jail, in, transvaal, convicted, of, high, treason, and, nearly, sentenced, to, death, and, contributed, to, the, outbreak, of, the, second, boer, war, in, 1899, rhodes, was, sued, by, a, man, named, burrows, for, falsely, representing, the, purpose, of, the, raid, and, thereby, convincing, him, to, participate, in, the, raid, burrows, was, severely, wounded, and, had, to, have, his, leg, amputated, his, suit, for, 3, 000, in, damages, was, successful, rhodes, used, his, wealth, and, that, of, his, business, partner, alfred, beit, and, other, investors, to, pursue, his, dream, of, creating, a, british, empire, in, new, territories, to, the, north, by, obtaining, mineral, concessions, from, the, most, powerful, indigenous, chiefs, rhodes, competitive, advantage, over, other, mineral, prospecting, companies, was, his, combination, of, wealth, and, astute, political, instincts, also, called, the, imperial, factor, as, he, often, collaborated, with, the, british, government, he, befriended, its, local, representatives, the, british, commissioners, and, through, them, organized, british, protectorates, over, the, mineral, concession, areas, via, separate, but, related, treaties, in, this, way, he, obtained, both, legality, and, security, for, mining, operations, he, could, then, attract, more, investors, imperial, expansion, and, capital, investment, went, hand, in, hand, the, imperial, factor, was, a, double, edged, sword, rhodes, did, not, want, the, bureaucrats, of, the, colonial, office, in, london, to, interfere, in, the, empire, in, africa, he, wanted, british, settlers, and, local, politicians, and, governors, to, run, it, this, put, him, on, a, collision, course, with, many, in, britain, as, well, as, with, british, missionaries, who, favoured, what, they, saw, as, the, more, ethical, direct, rule, from, london, rhodes, prevailed, because, he, would, pay, the, cost, of, administering, the, territories, to, the, north, of, south, africa, against, his, future, mining, profits, the, colonial, office, did, not, have, enough, funding, for, this, rhodes, promoted, his, business, interests, as, in, the, strategic, interest, of, britain, preventing, the, portuguese, the, germans, or, the, boers, from, moving, into, south, central, africa, rhodes, s, companies, and, agents, cemented, these, advantages, by, obtaining, many, mining, concessions, as, exemplified, by, the, rudd, and, lochner, concessions, rhodes, had, already, tried, and, failed, to, get, a, mining, concession, from, lobengula, king, of, the, ndebele, of, matabeleland, in, 1888, he, tried, again, he, sent, john, smith, moffat, son, of, the, missionary, robert, moffat, who, was, trusted, by, lobengula, to, persuade, the, latter, to, sign, a, treaty, of, friendship, with, britain, and, to, look, favourably, on, rhodes, s, proposals, his, associate, charles, rudd, together, with, francis, thompson, and, rochfort, maguire, assured, lobengula, that, no, more, than, ten, white, men, would, mine, in, matabeleland, this, limitation, was, left, out, of, the, document, known, as, the, rudd, concession, which, lobengula, signed, furthermore, it, stated, that, the, mining, companies, could, do, anything, necessary, to, their, operations, when, lobengula, discovered, later, the, true, effects, of, the, concession, he, tried, to, renounce, it, but, the, british, government, ignored, him, during, the, company, s, early, days, rhodes, and, his, associates, set, themselves, up, to, make, millions, hundreds, of, millions, in, current, pounds, over, the, coming, years, through, what, has, been, described, as, a, suppressio, veri, which, must, be, regarded, as, one, of, rhodes, s, least, creditable, actions, contrary, to, what, the, british, government, and, the, public, had, been, allowed, to, think, the, rudd, concession, was, not, vested, in, the, british, south, africa, company, but, in, a, short, lived, ancillary, concern, of, rhodes, rudd, and, a, few, others, called, the, central, search, association, which, was, quietly, formed, in, london, in, 1889, this, entity, renamed, itself, the, united, concessions, company, in, 1890, and, soon, after, sold, the, rudd, concession, to, the, chartered, company, for, 1, 000, 000, shares, when, colonial, office, functionaries, discovered, this, chicanery, in, 1891, they, advised, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, viscount, knutsford, to, consider, revoking, the, concession, but, no, action, was, taken, armed, with, the, rudd, concession, in, 1889, rhodes, obtained, a, charter, from, the, british, government, for, his, british, south, africa, company, bsac, to, rule, police, and, make, new, treaties, and, concessions, from, the, limpopo, river, to, the, great, lakes, of, central, africa, he, obtained, further, concessions, and, treaties, north, of, the, zambezi, such, as, those, in, barotseland, the, lochner, concession, with, king, lewanika, in, 1890, which, was, similar, to, the, rudd, concession, and, in, the, lake, mweru, area, alfred, sharpe, s, 1890, kazembe, concession, rhodes, also, sent, sharpe, to, get, a, concession, over, mineral, rich, katanga, but, met, his, match, in, ruthlessness, when, sharpe, was, rebuffed, by, its, ruler, msiri, king, leopold, ii, of, belgium, obtained, a, concession, over, msiri, s, dead, body, for, his, congo, free, state, rhodes, also, wanted, bechuanaland, protectorate, incorporated, in, the, bsac, charter, but, three, tswana, kings, including, khama, iii, travelled, to, britain, and, won, over, british, public, opinion, for, it, to, remain, governed, by, the, british, colonial, office, in, london, rhodes, commented, it, is, humiliating, to, be, utterly, beaten, by, these, niggers, the, british, colonial, office, also, decided, to, administer, british, central, africa, owing, to, the, activism, of, david, livingstone, trying, to, end, the, east, african, arab, swahili, slave, trade, rhodes, paid, much, of, the, cost, so, that, the, british, central, africa, commissioner, sir, harry, johnston, and, his, successor, alfred, sharpe, would, assist, with, security, for, rhodes, in, the, bsac, s, north, eastern, territories, johnston, shared, rhodes, s, expansionist, views, but, he, and, his, successors, were, not, as, pro, settler, as, rhodes, and, disagreed, on, dealings, with, africans, the, bsac, had, its, own, police, force, the, british, south, africa, police, which, was, used, to, control, matabeleland, and, mashonaland, in, present, day, zimbabwe, the, company, had, hoped, to, start, a, new, rand, from, the, ancient, gold, mines, of, the, shona, because, gold, deposits, weren, t, as, plentiful, as, they, had, hoped, many, of, the, white, settlers, who, accompanied, the, bsac, to, mashonaland, became, farmers, rather, than, miners, white, settlers, and, their, locally, employed, native, police, engaged, in, widespread, indiscriminate, rape, of, ndebele, women, in, the, early, 1890s, the, ndebele, and, the, shona, the, two, main, but, rival, peoples, took, advantage, of, the, absence, of, most, of, the, bsap, for, the, jameson, raid, in, january, 1896, they, separately, rebelled, against, the, coming, of, the, european, settlers, and, the, bsac, defeated, them, in, the, second, matabele, war, rhodes, went, to, matabeleland, after, his, resignation, as, cape, colony, premier, and, appointed, himself, colonel, in, his, own, column, of, irregular, troops, moving, from, salisbury, to, bulawayo, to, relieve, the, siege, of, whites, there, he, remained, managing, director, of, the, bsac, with, power, of, attorney, to, take, decisions, without, reference, back, to, the, board, in, london, until, june, 1896, defying, chamberlain, s, calls, to, resign, and, he, gave, instructions, that, no, mercy, be, shown, in, putting, down, the, rebellion, telling, officers, that, your, instructions, are, he, told, a, major, to, do, the, most, harm, you, can, to, the, natives, around, you, he, ordered, a, police, officer, to, kill, all, you, can, even, those, ndebele, who, begged, for, mercy, and, threw, down, their, arms, shortly, after, learning, of, the, assassination, of, the, ndebele, spiritual, leader, mlimo, by, the, american, scout, frederick, russell, burnham, and, after, participating, in, the, cavalry, charge, at, one, of, the, last, pitched, battles, of, this, phase, of, the, war, rhodes, associate, johan, colenbrander, arranged, for, a, meeting, with, the, remaining, ndebele, chiefs, rhodes, and, a, few, colleagues, walked, unarmed, into, the, ndebele, stronghold, in, matobo, hills, in, a, series, of, meetings, between, august, and, october, he, persuaded, the, impi, to, lay, down, their, arms, thus, ending, the, second, matabele, war, in, the, aftermath, of, the, war, in, matabeleland, but, whilst, the, uprising, in, mashonaland, was, being, suppressed, rhodes, returned, to, london, to, give, evidence, to, the, uk, house, of, commons, select, committee, of, enquiry, into, the, jameson, raid, as, rhodes, had, incriminating, telegrams, demonstrating, the, complicity, and, foreknowledge, of, the, raid, by, joseph, chamberlain, the, colonial, secretary, he, and, his, solicitor, were, able, to, blackmail, chamberlain, into, retaining, the, bsac, charter, leaving, the, company, in, charge, of, administering, the, territory, north, of, the, limpopo, even, as, it, became, a, crown, colony, rhodes, returned, to, mashonaland, further, overseeing, the, suppression, of, the, uprising, there, into, 1897, the, scandal, attached, to, his, name, did, not, prevent, him, rejoining, the, board, of, the, bsac, in, 1898, he, remained, an, mp, in, the, cape, parliament, and, a, privy, councillor, by, the, end, of, 1894, the, territories, over, which, the, bsac, had, concessions, or, treaties, collectively, called, zambesia, after, the, zambezi, river, flowing, through, the, middle, comprised, an, area, of, 1, 143, 000, km, 2, between, the, limpopo, river, and, lake, tanganyika, in, may, 1895, its, name, was, officially, changed, to, rhodesia, reflecting, rhodes, s, popularity, among, settlers, who, had,

the, designations, north, western, and, north, eastern, rhodesia, were, used, from, 1895, for, the, territory, which, later, became, northern, rhodesia, then, zambia, he, built, a, house, for, himself, in, 1897, in, bulawayo, rhodes, decreed, in, his, will, that, he, was, to, be, buried, in, matopos, hills, now, matobo, hills, after, his, death, in, the, cape, in, 1902, his, body, was, transported, by, train, to, bulawayo, his, burial, was, attended, by, ndebele, chiefs, now, paid, agents, of, the, bsac, administration, who, asked, that, the, firing, party, should, not, discharge, their, rifles, as, this, would, disturb, the, spirits, then, for, the, first, time, they, gave, a, white, man, the, matabele, royal, salute, bayete, rhodes, is, buried, alongside, leander, starr, jameson, and, 34, british, soldiers, killed, in, the, shangani, patrol, despite, occasional, efforts, to, return, his, body, to, the, united, kingdom, his, grave, remains, there, still, part, and, parcel, of, the, history, of, zimbabwe, and, attracts, thousands, of, visitors, each, year, one, of, rhodes, s, dreams, was, for, a, red, line, on, the, map, from, the, cape, to, cairo, on, geo, political, maps, british, dominions, were, always, denoted, in, red, or, pink, rhodes, had, been, instrumental, in, securing, southern, african, states, for, the, empire, he, and, others, felt, the, best, way, to, unify, the, possessions, facilitate, governance, enable, the, military, to, move, quickly, to, hot, spots, or, conduct, war, help, settlement, and, foster, trade, would, be, to, build, the, cape, to, cairo, railway, this, enterprise, was, not, without, its, problems, france, had, a, conflicting, strategy, in, the, late, 1890s, to, link, its, colonies, from, west, to, east, across, the, continent, and, the, portuguese, produced, the, pink, map, representing, their, claims, to, sovereignty, in, africa, ultimately, belgium, and, germany, proved, to, be, the, main, obstacles, to, the, british, objective, until, the, united, kingdom, conquered, and, seized, tanganyika, from, the, germans, as, a, league, of, nations, mandate, in, world, war, i, rhodes, wanted, to, expand, the, british, empire, because, he, believed, that, the, anglo, saxon, race, was, destined, to, greatness, in, what, he, described, as, a, draft, of, some, of, my, ideas, written, in, 1877, while, a, student, at, oxford, rhodes, said, of, the, english, i, contend, that, we, are, the, first, race, in, the, world, and, that, the, more, of, the, world, we, inhabit, the, better, it, is, for, the, human, race, i, contend, that, every, acre, added, to, our, territory, means, the, birth, of, more, of, the, english, race, who, otherwise, would, not, be, brought, into, existence, rhodes, bemoaned, that, there, was, little, land, left, to, conquer, and, said, to, think, of, these, stars, that, you, see, overhead, at, night, these, vast, worlds, which, we, can, never, reach, i, would, annex, the, planets, if, i, could, i, often, think, of, that, it, makes, me, sad, to, see, them, so, clear, and, yet, so, far, furthermore, rhodes, saw, imperialism, as, a, way, to, alleviate, domestic, social, problems, in, order, to, save, the, 40, 000, 000, inhabitants, of, the, united, kingdom, from, a, bloody, civil, war, we, colonial, statesmen, must, acquire, new, lands, to, settle, the, surplus, population, to, provide, new, markets, for, the, goods, produced, in, the, factories, and, mines, the, empire, as, i, have, always, said, is, a, bread, and, butter, question, if, you, want, to, avoid, civil, war, you, must, become, imperialists, rhodes, wanted, to, develop, a, commonwealth, in, which, all, of, the, british, dominated, countries, in, the, empire, would, be, represented, in, the, british, parliament, rhodes, explicitly, stipulated, in, his, will, that, all, races, should, be, eligible, for, the, scholarships, it, is, said, that, he, wanted, to, develop, an, american, elite, of, philosopher, kings, who, would, have, the, united, states, rejoin, the, british, empire, as, rhodes, also, respected, and, admired, the, germans, and, their, kaiser, he, allowed, german, students, to, be, included, in, the, rhodes, scholarships, he, believed, that, eventually, the, united, kingdom, including, ireland, the, us, and, germany, together, would, dominate, the, world, and, ensure, perpetual, peace, rhodes, s, views, on, race, have, been, debated, he, supported, the, rights, of, indigenous, africans, to, vote, but, critics, have, labelled, him, as, an, architect, of, apartheid, and, a, white, supremacist, particularly, since, 2015, according, to, magubane, rhodes, was, unhappy, that, in, many, cape, constituencies, africans, could, be, decisive, if, more, of, them, exercised, this, right, to, vote, under, current, law, with, rhodes, arguing, that, the, native, is, to, be, treated, as, a, child, and, denied, the, franchise, we, must, adopt, a, system, of, despotism, such, as, works, in, india, in, our, relations, with, the, barbarism, of, south, africa, rhodes, advocated, the, governance, of, indigenous, africans, living, in, the, cape, colony, in, a, state, of, barbarism, and, communal, tenure, as, a, subject, race, i, do, not, go, so, far, as, the, member, for, victoria, west, who, would, not, give, the, black, man, a, vote, if, the, whites, maintain, their, position, as, the, supreme, race, the, day, may, come, when, we, shall, be, thankful, that, we, have, the, natives, with, us, in, their, proper, position, he, once, stated, i, prefer, land, to, niggers, and, referred, to, the, anglo, saxon, race, as, the, best, most, human, most, honourable, race, the, world, possesses, he, thought, that, those, lands, which, were, occupied, by, the, most, despicable, specimens, of, human, beings, should, be, inhabited, by, anglo, saxons, however, others, have, disputed, these, views, for, example, historian, raymond, c, mensing, notes, that, rhodes, has, the, reputation, as, the, most, flamboyant, exemplar, of, the, british, imperial, spirit, and, always, believed, that, british, institutions, were, the, best, mensing, argues, that, rhodes, quietly, developed, a, more, nuanced, concept, of, imperial, federation, in, africa, and, that, his, mature, views, were, more, balanced, and, realistic, according, to, mensing, rhodes, was, not, a, biological, or, maximal, racist, despite, his, support, for, what, became, the, basis, for, the, apartheid, system, he, is, best, seen, as, a, cultural, or, minimal, racist, in, a, 2016, opinion, piece, for, the, times, oxford, university, professor, nigel, biggar, argued, that, although, rhodes, was, a, committed, imperialist, the, charges, of, racism, against, him, are, unfounded, in, a, 2021, article, biggar, further, argued, that, if, rhodes, was, a, racist, he, would, not, have, enjoyed, cordial, relations, with, individual, africans, he, would, not, have, regarded, them, as, capable, of, civilisation, and, he, would, not, have, supported, their, right, to, vote, at, all, nor, would, he, have, stipulated, in, his, final, will, of, july, 1899, that, the, scholarships, that, would, famously, bear, his, name, should, be, awarded, without, regard, for, race, and, yet, he, did, all, these, things, on, domestic, politics, within, britain, rhodes, was, a, supporter, of, the, liberal, party, rhodes, only, major, impact, was, his, large, scale, support, of, the, irish, nationalist, party, led, by, charles, stewart, parnell, 1846, 1891, rhodes, worked, well, with, the, afrikaners, in, the, cape, colony, he, supported, teaching, dutch, as, well, as, english, in, public, schools, while, prime, minister, of, the, cape, colony, he, helped, to, remove, most, of, their, legal, disabilities, he, was, a, friend, of, jan, hofmeyr, leader, of, the, afrikaner, bond, and, it, was, largely, because, of, afrikaner, support, that, he, became, prime, minister, of, the, cape, colony, rhodes, advocated, greater, self, government, for, the, cape, colony, in, line, with, his, preference, for, the, empire, to, be, controlled, by, local, settlers, and, politicians, rather, than, by, london, scholar, and, zimbabwean, author, peter, godwin, whilst, critical, of, rhodes, writes, that, he, needs, to, be, viewed, via, the, prisms, and, cultural, and, social, perspective, of, his, epoch, positing, that, rhodes, was, no, 19th, century, hitler, he, wasn, t, so, much, a, freak, as, a, man, of, his, time, rhodes, and, the, white, pioneers, in, southern, africa, did, behave, despicably, by, today, s, standards, but, no, worse, than, the, white, settlers, in, north, america, south, america, and, australia, and, in, some, senses, better, considering, that, the, genocide, of, natives, in, africa, was, less, complete, for, all, the, former, african, colonies, are, now, ruled, by, indigenous, peoples, unlike, the, americas, and, the, antipodes, most, of, whose, aboriginal, natives, were, all, but, exterminated, godwin, goes, on, to, say, rhodes, and, his, cronies, fit, in, perfectly, with, their, surroundings, and, conformed, to, the, morality, or, lack, of, it, of, the, day, as, is, so, often, the, case, history, simply, followed, the, gravitational, pull, of, superior, firepower, rhodes, never, married, pleading, i, have, too, much, work, on, my, hands, and, saying, that, he, would, not, be, a, dutiful, husband, author, robin, brown, has, claimed, in, the, secret, society, cecil, john, rhodes, s, plan, for, a, new, world, order, that, rhodes, was, a, homosexual, who, was, in, love, with, his, private, secretary, neville, pickering, and, that, he, established, a, homosexual, hegemony, which, was, already, operative, in, the, secret, society, went, on, to, influence, if, not, control, british, politics, at, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, paul, maylam, of, rhodes, university, criticised, the, book, in, a, review, for, the, conversation, as, based, heavily, on, surmise, and, assertion, and, lacking, referenced, source, material, to, substantiate, its, claims, as, well, as, being, riddled, with, basic, factual, errors, according, to, his, personal, banker, lewis, mitchell, rhodes, took, on, occasions, a, singularly, human, interest, in, the, welfare, of, young, men, and, read, their, characters, with, discernment, once, when, twitted, with, his, preference, for, young, men, he, retorted, of, course, of, course, they, must, soon, take, up, our, work, we, must, teach, them, what, to, do, and, what, to, avoid, according, to, his, secretary, philip, jourdan, he, seemed, to, have, a, liking, for, young, men, and, was, particularly, partial, to, people, with, blue, eyes, graham, bower, the, deputy, to, sir, hercules, robinson, described, rhodes, and, pickering, s, relationship, as, an, absolutely, lover, like, friendship, rhodes, biographers, have, been, divided, on, the, question, of, his, sexuality, john, gilbert, lockhart, and, c, m, woodhouse, denied, that, rhodes, was, homosexual, while, stuart, cloete, and, antony, thomas, took, the, view, that, he, was, asexual, robert, i, rotberg, and, brian, roberts, have, asserted, that, he, was, homosexual, according, to, rotberg, that, rhodes, was, homosexual, is, indisputable, on, the, basis, of, the, available, evidence, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, rhodes, was, stalked, by, polish, princess, catherine, radziwi, born, rzewuska, who, had, married, into, the, noble, polish, family, radziwi, the, princess, falsely, claimed, that, she, was, engaged, to, rhodes, and, that, they, were, having, an, affair, she, asked, him, to, marry, her, but, rhodes, refused, in, reaction, she, accused, him, of, loan, fraud, he, had, to, go, to, trial, and, testify, against, her, accusation, she, wrote, a, biography, of, rhodes, called, cecil, rhodes, man, and, empire, maker, her, accusations, were, eventually, proven, to, be, false, during, the, second, boer, war, rhodes, went, to, kimberley, at, the, onset, of, the, siege, in, a, calculated, move, to, raise, the, political, stakes, on, the, government, to, dedicate, resources, to, the, defence, of, the, city, the, military, felt, he, was, more, of, a, liability, than, an, asset, and, found, him, intolerable, the, officer, commanding, the, garrison, of, kimberley, lieutenant, colonel, robert, kekewich, experienced, serious, personal, difficulties, with, rhodes, because, of, the, latter, s, inability, to, co, operate, despite, these, differences, rhodes, company, was, instrumental, in, the, defence, of, the, city, providing, water, and, refrigeration, facilities, constructing, fortifications, and, manufacturing, an, armoured, train, shells, and, a, one, off, gun, named, long, cecil, rhodes, used, his, position, and, influence, to, lobby, the, british, government, to, relieve, the, siege, of, kimberley, claiming, in, the, press, that, the, situation, in, the, city, was, desperate, the, military, wanted, to, assemble, a, large, force, to, take, the, boer, cities, of, bloemfontein, and, pretoria, but, they, were, compelled, to, change, their, plans, and, send, three, separate, smaller, forces, to, relieve, the, sieges, of, kimberley, mafeking, and, ladysmith, although, rhodes, remained, a, leading, figure, in, the, politics, of, southern, africa, especially, during, the, second, boer, war, he, was, dogged, by, ill, health, throughout, his, relatively, short, life, he, was, sent, to, natal, aged, 16, because, it, was, believed, the, climate, might, help, problems, with, his, heart, on, returning, to, england, in, 1872, his, health, again, deteriorated, with, heart, and, lung, problems, to, the, extent, that, his, doctor, sir, morell, mackenzie, believed, he, would, survive, only, six, months, he, returned, to, kimberley, where, his, health, improved, from, age, 40, his, heart, condition, returned, with, increasing, severity, until, his, death, from, heart, failure, in, 1902, aged, 48, at, his, seaside, cottage, in, muizenberg, the, government, arranged, an, epic, journey, by, train, from, the, cape, to, rhodesia, with, the, funeral, train, stopping, at, every, station, to, allow, mourners, to, pay, their, respects, it, was, reported, that, at, kimberley, practically, the, entire, population, marched, in, procession, past, the, funeral, car, he, was, finally, laid, to, rest, at, world, s, view, a, hilltop, located, approximately, 35, kilometres, 22, mi, south, of, bulawayo, in, what, was, then, rhodesia, today, his, gravesite, is, part, of, matobo, national, park, zimbabwe, rhodes, has, been, the, target, of, much, recent, criticism, with, some, historians, attacking, him, as, a, ruthless, imperialist, and, white, supremacist, the, continued, presence, of, his, grave, in, the, matopos, now, matobo, hills, has, not, been, without, controversy, in, contemporary, zimbabwe, in, december, 2010, cain, mathema, the, governor, of, bulawayo, branded, the, grave, outside, the, country, s, second, city, an, insult, to, the, african, ancestors, and, said, he, believed, its, presence, had, brought, bad, luck, and, poor, weather, to, the, region, in, february, 2012, mugabe, loyalists, and, zanu, pf, activists, visited, the, grave, site, demanding, permission, from, the, local, chief, to, exhume, rhodes, s, remains, and, return, them, to, britain, many, considered, this, a, nationalist, political, stunt, in, the, run, up, to, an, election, and, local, chief, masuku, and, godfrey, mahachi, one, of, the, country, s, foremost, archaeologists, strongly, expressed, their, opposition, to, the, grave, being, removed, due, to, its, historical, significance, to, zimbabwe, then, president, robert, mugabe,

is, named, after, him, in, the, early, 2000s, during, the, height, of, the, land, reform, and, racial, tensions, zanu, pf, politicians, called, for, a, change, in, all, the, country, s, school, names, with, colonial, ties, however, efforts, were, mostly, fruitless, as, most, people, felt, that, it, was, unnecessary, and, names, of, places, they, live, in, reflect, the, diverse, identity, and, cultural, heritage, of, the, country, but, called, for, the, government, to, embrace, the, history, of, the, country, and, allow, room, for, new, names, for, new, places, in, the, ever, growing, towns, and, cities, in, his, second, will, written, in, 1877, before, he, had, accumulated, his, wealth, rhodes, wanted, to, create, a, secret, society, that, would, bring, the, whole, world, under, british, rule, his, biographer, calls, it, an, extensive, fantasy, rhodes, envisioned, a, secret, society, to, extend, british, rule, worldwide, including, china, japan, all, of, africa, and, south, america, and, indeed, the, united, states, as, well, to, and, for, the, establishment, promotion, and, development, of, a, secret, society, the, true, aim, and, object, whereof, shall, be, for, the, extension, of, british, rule, throughout, the, world, the, perfecting, of, a, system, of, emigration, from, the, united, kingdom, and, of, colonisation, by, british, subjects, of, all, lands, where, the, means, of, livelihood, are, attainable, by, energy, labour, and, enterprise, and, especially, the, occupation, by, british, settlers, of, the, entire, continent, of, africa, the, holy, land, the,

system, of, colonial, representation, in, the, imperial, parliament, which, may, tend, to, weld, together, the, disjointed, members, of, the, empire, and, finally, the, foundation, of, so, great, a, power, as, to, render, wars, impossible, and, promote, the, best, interests, of, humanity, rhodes, s, final, will, when, he, actually, did, have, money, was, much, more, realistic, and, focused, on, scholarships, he, also, left, a, large, area, of, land, on, the, slopes, of, table, mountain, to, the, south, african, nation, part, of, this, estate, became, the, upper, campus, of, the, university, of, cape, town, another, part, became, the, kirstenbosch, national, botanical, garden, while, much, was, spared, from, development, and, is, now, an, important, conservation, area, south, africa, s, rhodes, university, is, named, after, him, in, his, last, will, he, provided, for, the, establishment, of, the, rhodes, scholarship, over, the, course, of, the, previous, half, century, governments, universities, and, individuals, in, the, settler, colonies, had, been, establishing, travelling, scholarships, for, this, purpose, the, rhodes, awards, fit, the, established, pattern, the,

memorial, stands, on, rhodes, s, favourite, spot, on, the, slopes, of, devil, s, peak, cape, town, with, a, view, looking, north, and, east, towards, the, cape, to, cairo, route, from, 1910, to, 1984, rhodes, s, house, in, cape, town, groote, schuur, was, the, official, cape, residence, of, the, prime, ministers, of, south, africa, and, continued, as, a, presidential, residence, his, birthplace, was, established, in, 1938, as, the, rhodes, memorial, museum, now, known, as, bishops, stortford, museum, the, cottage, in, muizenberg, where, he, died, is, a, provincial, heritage, site, in, the,

of, rhodes, material, can, be, seen, including, the, original, de, beers, board, room, table, around, which, diamonds, worth, billions, of, dollars, were, traded, rhodes, university, college, now, rhodes, university, in, grahamstown, was, established, in, his, name, by, his, trustees, and, founded, by, act, of, parliament, on, 31, may, 1904, the, residents, of, kimberley, northern, cape, elected, to, build, a, memorial, in, rhodes, s, honour, in, their, city, which, was, unveiled, in, 1907, the, 72, ton, bronze, statue, depicts, rhodes, on, his, horse, looking, north, with, map, in, hand, and, dressed, as, he, was, when, he, met, the, ndebele, after, their, rebellion, the, founder, of, the, original, country, of, rhodesia, now, zimbabwe, cecil, john, rhodes, first, visited, nyanga, in, the, eastern, highlands, of, the, country, in, 1897, captivated, by, the, unspoilt, and, breathtaking, beauty, of, the, area, he, immediately, purchased, a, parcel, of, farms, totalling, 40, 000, ha, and, then, proceeded, to, import, cattle, from, mozambique, and, develop, extensive, plantations, of, apple, and, fruit, trees, when, he, died, in, 1902, rhodes, bequeathed, most, of, the, estate, to, the, nation, and, this, now, forms, the, nyanga, national, park, rhodes, s, original, farmhouse, has, been, meticulously, preserved, and, is, now, the, rhodes, nyanga, hotel, memorials, to, rhodes, have, been, opposed, since, at, least, the, 1950s, when, some, afrikaner, students, demanded, the, removal, of, a, rhodes, statue, at, the, university, of, cape, town, a, 2015, movement, known, as, rhodes, must, fall, or, rhodesmustfall, on, social, media, began, with, student, protests, at, the, university, of, cape, town, that, were, successful, in, getting, university, authorities, to, remove, the, rhodes, statue, from, the, campus, the, protest, also, had, the, broader, goal, of, highlighting, what, the, activists, considered, the, lack, of, systemic, post, apartheid, racial, transformation, in, south, african, institutions, following, a, series, of, protests, and, vandalism, at, the, university, of, cape, town, various, movements, both, in, south, africa, and, other, countries, have, been, launched, in, opposition, to, cecil, rhodes, memorials, these, include, a, campaign, to, change, the, name, of, rhodes, university, and, to, remove, a, statue, of, rhodes, from, oriel, college, oxford, the, campaign, was, covered, in, a, documentary, by, channel, 4, which, was, called, the, battle, for, britain, s, heroes, the, documentary, was, commissioned, after, afua, hirsch, wrote, an, article, on, the, topic, moreover, an, article, by, amit, chaudhuri, in, the, guardian, suggested, the, criticism, was, unsurprising, and, overdue, other, academics, including, kehinde, andrews, prominent, british, academic, and, author, specialising, in, black, studies, have, vocally, spoken, in, favour, of, rhodesmustfall, however, oriel, college, opted, to, keep, the, rhodes, statue, despite, the, protests, oriel, college, claimed, in, 2016, they, would, lose, about, 100, million, worth, of, gifts, if, they, removed, the, statue, nevertheless, in, june, 2020, the, college, voted, in, favour, of, setting, up, an, independent, commission, of, inquiry, amid, widespread, support, for, removing, the, statue, a, statue, of, rhodes, was, erected, in, the, city, of, bulawayo, in, 1904, in, the, city, centre, in, 1981, after, the, country, s, independence, the, statue, was, removed, to, the, centenary, park, at, the, natural, history, museum, of, zimbabwe, encyclop, dia, britannica, discussing, his, legacy, wrote, of, rhodes, that, he, once, defined, his, policy, as, equal, rights, for, every, white, man, south, of, the, zambezi, and, later, under, liberal, pressure, amended, white, to, civilized, but, he, probably, regarded, the, possibility, of, native, africans, becoming, civilized, as, so, remote, that, the, two, expressions, in, his, mind, came, to, the, same, thing, as, part, of, his, legacy, on, his, death, rhodes, left, a, significant, amount, of, money, to, be, used, to, finance, talented, young, scholars, race, was, not, a, criterion, at, oxford, currently, in, oxford, a, number, of, those, south, african, and, zimbabwean, recipients, of, funds, from, his, legacy, are, campaigning, for, his, statue, to, be, removed, from, display, in, oxford, when, asked, if, there, was, any, double, standard, or, hypocrisy, in, being, funded, by, the, rhodes, scholarship, fund, and, benefiting, from, the, opportunity,
