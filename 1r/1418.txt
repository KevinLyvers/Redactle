athist, ideology, originated, in, syria, and, the, ba, ath, party, had, a, large, following, in, syria, at, the, time, but, in, 1955, there, were, fewer, than, 300, ba, ath, party, members, in, iraq, and, it, is, believed, that, saddam, s, primary, reason, for, joining, the, party, as, opposed, to, the, more, established, iraqi, nationalist, parties, was, his, familial, connection, to, ahmed, hassan, al, bakr, and, other, leading, ba, athists, through, his, uncle, revolutionary, sentiment, was, characteristic, of, the, era, in, iraq, and, throughout, the, middle, east, in, iraq, progressives, and, socialists, assailed, traditional, political, elites, colonial, era, bureaucrats, and, landowners, wealthy, merchants, and, tribal, chiefs, and, monarchists, moreover, the, pan, arab, nationalism, of, gamal, abdel, nasser, in, egypt, profoundly, influenced, young, ba, athists, like, saddam, the, rise, of, nasser, foreshadowed, a, wave, of, revolutions, throughout, the, middle, east, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, with, the, collapse, of, the, monarchies, of, iraq, egypt, and, libya, nasser, inspired, nationalists, throughout, the, middle, east, by, fighting, the, british, and, the, french, during, the, suez, crisis, of, 1956, modernizing, egypt, and, uniting, the, arab, world, politically, saddam, s, father, in, law, khairallah, talfah, was, reported, to, have, served, five, years, in, prison, for, his, role, in, fighting, against, great, britain, in, the, 1941, iraqi, coup, d, tat, and, anglo, iraqi, war, and, often, mentored, and, told, tales, of, his, exploits, to, the, young, saddam, in, 1958, a, year, after, saddam, had, joined, the, ba, ath, party, army, officers, led, by, general, abd, al, karim, qasim, overthrew, faisal, ii, of, iraq, in, the, 14, july, revolution, the, ba, ath, party, was, originally, represented, in, qasim, s, cabinet, however, qasim, reluctant, to, join, nasser, s, newly, formed, union, between, egypt, and, syria, sided, with, various, groups, within, iraq, notably, the, social, democrats, and, the, iraqi, communist, party, that, told, him, such, an, action, would, be, dangerous, instead, qasim, adopted, a, wataniyah, policy, of, iraq, first, to, strengthen, his, own, position, within, the, government, qasim, also, had, an, alliance, with, the, iraqi, communist, party, which, was, opposed, to, the, notion, of, pan, arabism, his, policies, angered, several, pan, arab, organisations, including, the, ba, ath, party, which, later, began, plotting, to, assassinate, qasim, at, al, rashid, street, on, 7, october, 1959, and, take, power, saddam, was, recruited, to, the, assassination, conspiracy, by, its, ring, leader, abdul, karim, al, shaikhly, after, one, of, the, would, be, assassins, left, during, the, ambush, saddam, who, was, only, supposed, to, provide, cover, began, shooting, prematurely, which, disorganised, the, whole, operation, qasim, s, chauffeur, was, killed, and, qasim, was, hit, in, the, arm, and, shoulder, the, assassins, thought, they, had, killed, qasim, and, quickly, retreated, to, their, headquarters, but, qasim, survived, saddam, himself, is, not, believed, to, have, received, any, training, outside, of, iraq, as, he, was, a, late, addition, to, the, assassination, team, richard, sale, of, united, press, international, upi, citing, former, u, s, diplomat, and, intelligence, officials, adel, darwish, and, other, experts, reported, that, the, unsuccessful, assassination, attempt, on, qasim, was, a, collaboration, between, the, united, states, central, intelligence, agency, cia, and, egyptian, intelligence, pertinent, contemporary, records, relating, to, cia, operations, in, iraq, have, remained, classified, or, heavily, redacted, thus, allow, for, plausible, deniability, it, is, generally, accepted, that, egypt, in, some, capacity, was, involved, in, the, assassination, attempt, and, that, he, united, states, was, working, with, nasser, on, some, level, sale, and, darwish, s, account, has, been, disputed, by, historian, bryan, r, gibson, who, concludes, that, available, u, s, declassified, documents, show, that, while, the, united, states, was, aware, of, several, plots, against, qasim, it, had, still, adhered, to, nonintervention, policy, on, the, other, hand, historian, kenneth, osgood, writes, that, the, circumstantial, evidence, is, such, that, the, possibility, of, us, uar, collaboration, with, ba, ath, party, activists, cannot, be, ruled, out, concluding, that, hatever, the, validity, of, charges, at, the, very, least, currently, declassified, documents, reveal, that, us, officials, were, actively, considering, various, plots, against, qasim, and, that, the, cia, was, building, up, assets, for, covert, operations, in, iraq, at, the, time, of, the, attack, the, ba, ath, party, had, fewer, than, 1, 000, members, however, the, failed, assassination, attempt, led, to, widespread, exposure, for, saddam, and, the, ba, ath, within, iraq, where, both, had, previously, languished, in, obscurity, and, later, became, a, crucial, part, of, saddam, s, public, image, during, his, tenure, as, president, of, iraq, kanan, makiya, recounts, the, man, and, the, myth, merge, in, this, episode, his, biography, and, iraqi, television, which, stages, the, story, ad, nauseam, tells, of, his, familiarity, with, guns, from, the, age, of, ten, his, fearlessness, and, loyalty, to, the, party, during, the, 1959, operation, his, bravery, in, saving, his, comrades, by, commandeering, a, car, at, gunpoint, the, bullet, that, was, gouged, out, of, his, flesh, under, his, direction, in, hiding, the, iron, discipline, that, led, him, to, draw, a, gun, on, weaker, comrades, who, would, have, dropped, off, a, seriously, wounded, member, of, the, hit, team, at, a, hospital, the, calculating, shrewdness, that, helped, him, save, himself, minutes, before, the, police, broke, in, leaving, his, wounded, comrades, behind, and, finally, the, long, trek, of, a, wounded, man, from, house, to, house, city, to, town, across, the, desert, to, refuge, in, syria, michel, aflaq, the, leader, of, the, ba, athist, movement, organized, the, expulsion, of, leading, iraqi, ba, athist, members, such, as, fuad, al, rikabi, on, the, grounds, that, the, party, should, not, have, initiated, the, attempt, on, qasim, s, life, at, the, same, time, aflaq, secured, seats, in, the, iraqi, ba, ath, leadership, for, his, supporters, one, of, them, being, saddam, the, assassins, including, saddam, all, eventually, escaped, to, cairo, egypt, where, they, enjoyed, nasser, s, protection, for, the, remainder, of, qasim, s, tenure, in, power, saddam, initially, escaped, to, syria, and, then, to, egypt, itself, in, february, 1960, and, he, continued, to, live, there, until, 1963, graduating, from, high, school, in, 1961, and, unsuccessfully, pursuing, a, law, degree, at, cairo, law, school, 1962, 1963, it, is, possible, that, saddam, visited, the, u, s, embassy, in, cairo, during, his, exile, and, some, evidence, suggests, that, he, was, in, frequent, contact, with, us, officials, and, intelligence, agents, a, former, high, ranking, u, s, official, told, historians, marion, farouk, sluglett, and, peter, sluglett, that, iraqi, ba, athists, including, saddam, had, made, contact, with, the, american, authorities, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, army, officers, with, ties, to, the, ba, ath, party, overthrew, qasim, in, the, ramadan, revolution, coup, of, february, 1963, long, suspected, to, be, supported, by, the, cia, however, pertinent, contemporary, documents, relating, to, the, cia, s, operations, in, iraq, have, remained, classified, by, the, u, s, government, although, the, ba, athists, are, documented, to, have, maintained, supportive, relationships, with, u, s, officials, before, during, and, after, the, coup, ba, athist, leaders, were, appointed, to, the, cabinet, and, abdul, salam, arif, became, president, arif, dismissed, and, arrested, the, ba, athist, leaders, later, that, year, in, the, november, 1963, iraqi, coup, d, tat, being, exiled, in, egypt, at, the, time, saddam, played, no, role, in, the, 1963, coup, or, the, brutal, anti, communist, purge, that, followed, although, he, returned, to, iraq, after, the, coup, becoming, a, key, organizer, within, the, ba, ath, party, s, civilian, wing, upon, his, return, unlike, during, the, qasim, years, saddam, remained, in, iraq, following, arif, s, anti, ba, athist, purge, in, november, 1963, and, became, involved, in, planning, to, assassinate, arif, in, marked, contrast, to, qasim, saddam, knew, that, he, faced, no, death, penalty, from, arif, s, government, and, knowingly, accepted, the, risk, of, being, arrested, rather, than, fleeing, to, syria, again, saddam, was, arrested, in, october, 1964, and, served, approximately, two, years, in, prison, before, escaping, in, 1966, in, 1966, ahmed, hassan, al, bakr, appointed, him, deputy, secretary, of, the, regional, command, saddam, who, would, prove, to, be, a, skilled, organizer, revitalized, the, party, he, was, elected, to, the, regional, command, as, the, story, goes, with, help, from, michel, aflaq, the, founder, of, ba, athist, thought, in, september, 1966, saddam, initiated, an, extraordinary, challenge, to, syrian, domination, of, the, ba, ath, party, in, response, to, the, marxist, takeover, of, the, syrian, ba, ath, earlier, that, year, resulting, in, the, party, s, formalized, split, into, two, separate, factions, saddam, then, created, a, ba, athist, security, service, which, he, alone, controlled, saddam, convened, an, assembly, of, ba, ath, party, leaders, on, 22, july, 1979, during, the, assembly, which, he, ordered, videotaped, saddam, claimed, to, have, found, a, fifth, column, within, the, ba, ath, party, and, directed, muhyi, abdel, hussein, to, read, out, a, confession, and, the, names, of, 68, alleged, co, conspirators, these, members, were, labelled, disloyal, and, were, removed, from, the, room, one, by, one, and, taken, into, custody, after, the, list, was, read, saddam, congratulated, those, still, seated, in, the, room, for, their, past, and, future, loyalty, the, 68, people, arrested, at, the, meeting, were, subsequently, tried, together, and, found, guilty, of, treason, 22, were, sentenced, to, execution, other, high, ranking, members, of, the, party, formed, the, firing, squad, by, 1, august, 1979, hundreds, of, high, ranking, ba, ath, party, members, had, been, executed, there, is, a, feeling, that, at, least, three, million, iraqis, are, watching, the, eleven, million, others, a, european, diplomat, quoted, in, the, new, york, times, april, 3, 1984, iraqi,

parts, of, the, population, following, the, iranian, revolution, of, 1979, iraq, faced, the, prospect, of, r, gime, change, from, two, shi, ite, factions, dawa, and, sciri, which, aspired, to, model, iraq, on, its, neighbour, iran, as, a, shia, theocracy, a, separate, threat, to, iraq, came, from, parts, of, the, ethnic, kurdish, population, of, northern, iraq, which, opposed, being, part, of, an, iraqi, state, and, favored, independence, an, ongoing, ideology, which, had, preceded, ba, ath, party, rule, to, alleviate, the, threat, of, revolution, saddam, afforded, certain, benefits, to, the, potentially, hostile, population, membership, in, the, ba, ath, party, remained, open, to, all, iraqi, citizens, regardless, of, background, and, repressive, measures, were, taken, against, its, opponents, the, major, instruments, for, accomplishing, this, control, were, the, paramilitary, and, police, organizations, beginning, in, 1974, taha, yassin, ramadan, himself, a, kurdish, ba, athist, a, close, associate, of, saddam, commanded, the, people, s, army, which, had, responsibility, for, internal, security, as, the, ba, ath, party, s, paramilitary, the, people, s, army, acted, as, a, counterweight, against, any, coup, attempts, by, the, regular, armed, forces, in, addition, to, the, people, s, army, the, department, of, general, intelligence, was, the, most, notorious, arm, of,

terror, against, his, own, people, the, economist, described, saddam, as, one, of, the, last, of, the, 20th, century, s, great, dictators, but, not, the, least, in, terms, of, egotism, or, cruelty, or, morbid, will, to, power, saddam, s, regime, brought, about, the, deaths, of, at, least, 250, 000, iraqis, and, committed, war, crimes, in, iran, kuwait, and, saudi, arabia, human, rights, watch, and, amnesty, international, issued, regular, reports, of, widespread, imprisonment, and, torture, conversely, saddam, used, iraq, s, oil, wealth, to, develop, an, extensive, patronage, system, for, the, regime, s, supporters, although, saddam, is, often, described, as, a, totalitarian, leader, joseph, sassoon, notes, that, there, are, important, differences, between, saddam, s, repression, and, the, totalitarianism, practiced, by, adolf, hitler, and, joseph, stalin, particularly, with, regard, to, freedom, of, movement, and, freedom, of, religion, in, july, 1968, saddam, participated, in, a, bloodless, coup, led, by, ahmed, hassan, al, bakr, that, overthrew, abdul, rahman, arif, 174, salam, arif, s, brother, and, successor, while, saddam, s, role, in, the, coup, was, not, hugely, significant, except, in, the, official, account, saddam, planned, and, carried, out, the, subsequent, purge, of, the, non, ba, athist, faction, led, by, prime, minister, abd, ar, razzaq, an, naif, whose, support, had, been, essential, to, the, coup, s, success, according, to, a, semi, official, biography, saddam, personally, led, naif, at, gunpoint, to, the, plane, that, escorted, him, out, of, iraq, arif, was, given, refuge, in, london, and, then, istanbul, al, bakr, was, named, president, and, saddam, was, named, his, deputy, and, deputy, chairman, of, the, ba, athist, revolutionary, command, council, according, to, biographers, saddam, never, forgot, the, tensions, within, the, first, ba, athist, government, which, formed, the, basis, for, his, measures, to, promote, ba, ath, party, unity, as, well, as, his, resolve, to, maintain, power, and, programs, to, ensure, social, stability, although, saddam, was, al, bakr, s, deputy, he, was, a, strong, behind, the, scenes, party, politician, al, bakr, was, the, older, and, more, prestigious, of, the, two, but, by, 1969, saddam, clearly, had, become, the, moving, force, behind, the, party, in, 1976, saddam, rose, to, the, position, of, general, in, the, iraqi, armed, forces, and, rapidly, became, the, strongman, of, the, government, as, the, ailing, elderly, al, bakr, became, unable, to, execute, his, duties, saddam, took, on, an, increasingly, prominent, role, as, the, face, of, the, government, both, internally, and, externally, he, soon, became, the, architect, of, iraq, s, foreign, policy, and, represented, the, nation, in, all, diplomatic, situations, he, was, the, de, facto, leader, of, iraq, some, years, before, he, formally, came, to, power, in, 1979, he, slowly, began, to, consolidate, his, power, over, iraq, s, government, and, the, ba, ath, party, relationships, with, fellow, party, members, were, carefully, cultivated, and, saddam, soon, accumulated, a, powerful, circle, of, support, within, the, party, in, 1979, al, bakr, started, to, make, treaties, with, syria, also, under, ba, athist, leadership, that, would, lead, to, unification, between, the, two, countries, syrian, president, hafiz, al, assad, would, become, deputy, leader, in, a, union, and, this, would, drive, saddam, to, obscurity, saddam, acted, to, secure, his, grip, on, power, he, forced, the, ailing, al, bakr, to, resign, on, 16, july, 1979, and, formally, assumed, the, presidency, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, as, vice, chairman, of, the, revolutionary, command, council, formally, al, bakr, s,

first, launching, airstrikes, on, numerous, targets, in, iran, including, the, mehrabad, airport, of, tehran, before, occupying, the, oil, rich, iranian, province, of, khuzestan, which, also, has, a, sizable, arab, minority, the, invasion, was, initially, successful, as, iraq, captured, more, than, 25, 900, km, 2, of, iranian, territory, by, 5, december, 1980, with, the, support, of, other, arab, states, the, united, states, and, europe, and, heavily, financed, by, the, arab, states, of, the, persian, gulf, saddam, hussein, had, become, the, defender, of, the, arab, world, against, a, revolutionary, fundamentalist, and, shia, islamist, iran, the, only, exception, was, the, soviet, union, which, initially, refused, to, supply, iraq, on, the, basis, of, neutrality, in, the, conflict, although, in, his, memoirs, mikhail, gorbachev, claimed, that, leonid, brezhnev, refused, to, aid, saddam, over, infuriation, of, saddam, s, treatment, of, iraqi, communists, consequently, many, viewed, iraq, as, an, agent, of, the, civilized, world, the, blatant, disregard, of, international, law, and, violations, of, international, borders, were, ignored, instead, iraq, received, economic, and, military, support, from, its, allies, who, overlooked, saddam, s, use, of, chemical, warfare, against, the, kurds, and, the, iranians, in, addition, to, iraq, s, efforts, to, develop, nuclear, weapons, in, the, first, days, of, the, war, there, was, heavy, ground, fighting, around, strategic, ports, as, iraq, launched, an, attack, on, khuzestan, after, making, some, initial, gains, iraq, s, troops, began, to, suffer, losses, from, human, wave, attacks, by, iran, by, 1982, iraq, was, on, the, defensive, and, looking, for, ways, to, end, the, war, middle, east, special, envoy, donald, rumsfeld, met, saddam, hussein, on, 19, 20, december, 1983, iraq, quickly, found, itself, bogged, down, in, one, of, the, longest, and, most, destructive, wars, of, attrition, of, the, 20th, century, during, the, war, iraq, used, chemical, weapons, against, iranian, forces, fighting, on, the, southern, front, and, kurdish, separatists, who, were, attempting, to, open, up, a, northern, front, in, iraq, with, the, help, of, iran, iraqi, foreign, minister, tariq, aziz, later, acknowledged, iraq, s, use, of, chemical, weapons, against, iran, but, said, that, iran, had, used, them, against, iraq, first, these, chemical, weapons, were, developed, by, iraq, from, materials, and, technology, supplied, primarily, by, west, german, companies, as, well, as, using, dual, use, technology, imported, following, the, reagan, administration, s, lifting, of, export, restrictions, the, united, states, government, also, supplied, iraq, with, satellite, photos, showing, iranian, deployments, which, were, later, deemed, to, be, misleading, intelligence, information, designed, to, prolong, the, war, with, iran, and, increase, us, influence, in, the, region, contributing, to, the, iraqi, defeat, in, the, first, battle, of, al, faw, in, february, 1986, in, a, us, bid, to, open, full, diplomatic, relations, with, iraq, the, country, was, removed, from, the, us, list, of, state, sponsors, of, terrorism, in, february, 1982, ostensibly, this, was, because, of, improvement, in, the, regime, s, record, although, former, us, assistant, secretary, of, defense, noel, koch, later, stated, no, one, had, any, doubts, about, continued, involvement, in, terrorism, the, real, reason, was, to, help, them, succeed, in, the, war, against, iran, the, soviet, union, france, and, china, together, accounted, for, over, 90, of, the, value, of, iraq, s, arms, imports, between, 1980, and, 1988, while, the, united, states, supplied, iraq, with, arms, dual, use, technology, and, economic, aid, it, was, also, involved, in, a, covert, and, illegal, arms, deal, providing, sanctioned, iran, with, weaponry, this, political, scandal, became, known, as, the, iran, contra, affair, saddam, reached, out, to, other, arab, governments, for, cash, and, political, support, during, the, war, particularly, after, iraq, s, oil, industry, severely, suffered, at, the, hands, of, the, iranian, navy, in, the, persian, gulf, iraq, successfully, gained, some, military, and, financial, aid, as, well, as, diplomatic, and, moral, support, from, the, soviet, union, china, france, and, the, united, states, which, together, feared, the, prospects, of, the, expansion, of, revolutionary, iran, s, influence, in, the, region, the, iranians, demanding, that, the, international, community, should, force, iraq, to, pay, war, reparations, to, iran, refused, any, suggestions, for, a, cease, fire, despite, several, calls, for, a, ceasefire, by, the, united, nations, security, council, hostilities, continued, until, 20, august, 1988, the, bloody, eight, year, war, ended, in, a, stalemate, encyclop, dia, britannica, states, estimates, of, total, casualties, range, from, 1, 000, 000, to, twice, that, number, the, number, killed, on, both, sides, was, perhaps, 500, 000, with, iran, suffering, the, greatest, losses, neither, side, had, achieved, what, they, had, originally, desired, and, the, borders, were, left, nearly, unchanged, the, southern, oil, rich, and, prosperous, khuzestan, and, basra, area, the, main, focus, of, the, war, and, the, primary, source, of, their, economies, were, almost, completely, destroyed, and, were, left, at, the, pre, 1979, border, while, iran, managed, to, make, some, small, gains, on, its, borders, in, the, northern, kurdish, area, both, economies, previously, healthy, and, expanding, were, left, in, ruins, saddam, borrowed, tens, of, billions, of, dollars, from, other, arab, states, and, a, few, billions, from, elsewhere, during, the, 1980s, to, fight, iran, mainly, to, prevent, the, expansion, of, shi, a, radicalism, this, backfired, on, iraq, and, the, arab, states, for, khomeini, was, widely, perceived, as, a, hero, for, managing, to, defend, iran, and, maintain, the, war, with, little, foreign, support, against, the, heavily, backed, iraq, and, only, managed, to, boost, islamic, radicalism, not, only, within, the, arab, states, but, within, iraq, itself, creating, new, tensions, between, the, sunni, ba, ath, party, and, the, majority, shi, a, population, faced, with, rebuilding, iraq, s, infrastructure, and, internal, resistance, saddam, desperately, re, sought, cash, this, time, for, postwar, reconstruction, the, anfal, campaign, was, a, genocidal, campaign, that, took, place, during, the, iran, iraq, war, against, the, kurdish, people, and, many, others, in, kurdish, regions, of, iraq, led, by, the, government, of, saddam, hussein, and, headed, by, ali, hassan, al, majid, the, campaign, takes, its, name, from, qur, anic, chapter, 8, al, anf, l, which, was, used, as, a, code, name, by, the, former, iraqi, ba, athist, administration, for, a, series, of, attacks, against, the, peshmerga, rebels, and, the, mostly, kurdish, civilian, population, of, rural, northern, iraq, conducted, between, 1986, and, 1989, culminating, in, 1988, this, campaign, also, targeted, shabaks, and, yazidis, assyrians, turkoman, people, and, many, villages, belonging, to, these, ethnic, groups, were, also, destroyed, human, rights, watch, estimates, that, between, 50, 000, and, 100, 000, people, were, killed, some, kurdish, sources, put, the, number, higher, estimating, that, 182, 000, kurds, were, killed, on, 16, march, 1988, the, kurdish, town, of, halabja, was, attacked, with, a, mix, of, mustard, gas, and, nerve, agents, during, the, halabja, massacre, killing, between, 3, 200, and, 5, 000, people, and, injuring, 7, 000, to, 10, 000, more, mostly, civilians, the, attack, occurred, in, conjunction, with, the, anfal, campaign, designed, to, reassert, central, control, of, the, mostly, kurdish, population, of, areas, of, northern, iraq, and, defeat, the, kurdish, peshmerga, rebel, forces, following, the, incident, the, u, s, state, department, took, the, official, position, that, iran, was, partly, to, blame, for, the, halabja, massacre, a, study, by, the, defense, intelligence, agency, held, iran, responsible, for, the, attack, this, assessment, was, subsequently, used, by, the, central, intelligence, agency, for, much, of, the, early, 1990s, despite, this, few, observers, today, doubt, that, it, was, iraq, that, executed, the, halabja, massacre, the, end, of, the, war, with, iran, served, to, deepen, latent, tensions, between, iraq, and, its, wealthy, neighbor, kuwait, saddam, urged, the, kuwaitis, to, waive, the, iraqi, debt, accumulated, in, the, war, some, 30, billion, but, they, refused, saddam, pushed, oil, exporting, countries, to, raise, oil, prices, by, cutting, back, production, kuwait, refused, then, led, the, opposition, in, opec, to, the, cuts, that, saddam, had, requested, kuwait, was, pumping, large, amounts, of, oil, and, thus, keeping, prices, low, when, iraq, needed, to, sell, high, priced, oil, from, its, wells, to, pay, off, its, huge, debt, saddam, had, consistently, argued, that, kuwait, had, historically, been, an, integral, part, of, iraq, and, had, only, come, into, being, as, a, result, of, interference, from, the, british, government, echoing, a, belief, that, iraqi, nationalists, had, supported, for, the, past, fifty, years, this, belief, was, one, of, the, few, articles, of, faith, uniting, the, political, scene, in, a, nation, rife, with, sharp, social, ethnic, religious, and, ideological, divides, the, extent, of, kuwaiti, oil, reserves, also, intensified, tensions, in, the, region, the, oil, reserves, of, kuwait, with, a, population, of, 2, million, next, to, iraq, s, 25, were, roughly, equal, to, those, of, iraq, taken, together, iraq, and, kuwait, sat, on, top, of, some, 20, percent, of, the, world, s, known, oil, reserves, saudi, arabia, held, another, 25, percent, saddam, still, had, an, experienced, and, well, equipped, army, which, he, used, to, influence, regional, affairs, he, later, ordered, troops, to, the, iraq, kuwait, border, as, iraq, kuwait, relations, rapidly, deteriorated, saddam, was, receiving, conflicting, information, about, how, the, us, would, respond, to, the, prospects, of, an, invasion, for, one, washington, had, been, taking, measures, to, cultivate, a, constructive, relationship, with, iraq, for, roughly, a, decade, the, reagan, administration, gave, iraq, roughly, 4, billion, in, agricultural, credits, to, bolster, it, against, iran, saddam, s, iraq, became, the, third, largest, recipient, of, us, assistance, reacting, to, western, criticism, in, april, 1990, saddam, threatened, to, destroy, half, of, israel, with, chemical, weapons, if, it, moved, against, iraq, in, may, 1990, he, criticized, us, support, for, israel, warning, that, the, us, cannot, maintain, such, a, policy, while, professing, friendship, towards, the, arabs, in, july, 1990, he, threatened, force, against, kuwait, and, the, uae, saying, the, policies, of, some, arab, rulers, are, american, they, are, inspired, by, america, to, undermine, arab, interests, and, security, the, us, sent, warplanes, and, combat, ships, to, the, persian, gulf, in, response, to, these, threats, the, us, ambassador, to, iraq, april, glaspie, met, with, saddam, in, an, emergency, meeting, on, 25, july, 1990, where, the, iraqi, leader, attacked, american, policy, with, regards, to, kuwait, and, the, united, arab, emirates, uae, so, what, can, it, mean, when, america, says, it, will, now, protect, its, friends, it, can, only, mean, prejudice, against, iraq, this, stance, plus, maneuvers, and, statements, which, have, been, made, has, encouraged, the, uae, and, kuwait, to, disregard, iraqi, rights, if, you, use, pressure, we, will, deploy, pressure, and, force, we, know, that, you, can, harm, us, although, we, do, not, threaten, you, but, we, too, can, harm, you, everyone, can, cause, harm, according, to, their, ability, and, their, size, we, cannot, come, all, the, way, to, you, in, the, us, but, individual, arabs, may, reach, you, we, do, not, place, america, among, the, enemies, we, place, it, where, we, want, our, friends, to, be, and, we, try, to, be, friends, but, repeated, american, statements, last, year, made, it, apparent, that, america, did, not, regard, us, as, friends, glaspie, replied, i, know, you, need, funds, we, understand, that, and, our, opinion, is, that, you, should, have, the, opportunity, to, rebuild, your, country, but, we, have, no, opinion, on, the, arab, arab, conflicts, like, your, border, disagreement, with, kuwait, frankly, we, can, only, see, that, you, have, deployed, massive, troops, in, the, south, normally, that, would, not, be, any, of, our, business, but, when, this, happens, in, the, context, of, what, you, said, on, your, national, day, then, when, we, read, the, details, in, the, two, letters, of, the, foreign, minister, then, when, we, see, the, iraqi, point, of, view, that, the, measures, taken, by, the, uae, and, kuwait, is, in, the, final, analysis, parallel, to, military, aggression, against, iraq, then, it, would, be, reasonable, for, me, to, be, concerned, saddam, stated, that, he, would, attempt, last, ditch, negotiations, with, the, kuwaitis, but, iraq, would, not, accept, death, us, officials, attempted, to, maintain, a, conciliatory, line, with, iraq, indicating, that, while, george, h, w, bush, and, james, baker, did, not, want, force, used, they, would, not, take, any, position, on, the, iraq, kuwait, boundary, dispute, and, did, not, want, to, become, involved, later, iraq, and, kuwait, met, for, a, final, negotiation, session, which, failed, saddam, then, sent, his, troops, into, kuwait, as, tensions, between, washington, and, saddam, began, to, escalate, the, soviet, union, under, mikhail, gorbachev, strengthened, its, military, relationship, with, the, iraqi, leader, providing, him, military, advisers, arms, and, aid, on, 2, august, 1990, saddam, invaded, kuwait, initially, claiming, assistance, to, kuwaiti, revolutionaries, thus, sparking, an, international, crisis, on, 4, august, an, iraqi, backed, provisional, government, of, free, kuwait, was, proclaimed, but, a, total, lack, of, legitimacy, and, support, for, it, led, to, an, 8, august, announcement, of, a, merger, of, the, two, countries, on, 28, august, kuwait, formally, became, the, 19th, governorate, of, iraq, just, two, years, after, the, 1988, iraq, and, iran, truce, saddam, did, what, his, gulf, patrons, had, earlier, paid, him, to, prevent, having, removed, the, threat, of, iranian, fundamentalism, he, overran, kuwait, and, confronted, his, gulf, neighbors, in, the, name, of, arab, nationalism, and, islam, saddam, justified, the, invasion, of, kuwait, in, 1990, by, claiming, that, kuwait, had, always, been, an, integral, part, of, iraq, and, only, became, an, independent, nation, due, to, the, interference, of, the, british, empire, when, later, asked, why, he, invaded, kuwait, saddam, first, claimed, that, it, was, because, kuwait, was, rightfully, iraq, s, 19th, province, and, then, said, when, i, get, something, into, my, head, i, act, that, s, just, the, way, i, am, saddam, hussein, could, pursue, such, military, aggression, with, a, military, machine, paid, for, in, large, part, by, the, tens, of, billions, of, dollars, kuwait, and, the, gulf, states, had, poured, into, iraq, and, the, weapons, and, technology, provided, by, the, soviet, union, germany, and, france, it, was, revealed, during, his, 2003, 2004, interrogation, that, in, addition, to, economic, disputes, an, insulting, exchange, between, the, kuwaiti, emir, al, sabah, and, the, iraqi, foreign, minister, during, which, saddam, claimed, that, the, emir, stated, his, intention, to, turn, every, iraqi, woman, into, a, 10, prostitute, by, ruining, iraq, financially, was, a, decisive, factor, in, triggering, the, iraqi, invasion, shortly, before, he, invaded, kuwait, he, shipped, 100, new, mercedes, 200, series, cars, to, top, editors, in, egypt, and, jordan, two, days, before, the, first, attacks, saddam, reportedly, offered, egypt, s, hosni, mubarak, 50, million, dollars, in, cash, ostensibly, for, grain, george, h, w, bush, responded, cautiously, for, the, first, several, days, on, one, hand, kuwait, prior, to, this, point, had, been, a, virulent, enemy, of, israel, and, was, the, persian, gulf, monarchy, that, had, the, most, friendly, relations, with, the, soviets, on, the, other, hand, washington, foreign, policymakers, along, with, middle, east, experts, military, critics, and, firms, heavily, invested, in, the, region, were, extremely, concerned, with, stability, in, this, region, the, invasion, immediately, triggered, fears, that, the, world, s, price, of, oil, and, therefore, control, of, the, world, economy, was, at, stake, britain, profited, heavily, from, billions, of, dollars, of, kuwaiti, investments, and, bank, deposits, bush, was, perhaps, swayed, while, meeting, with, british, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, who, happened, to, be, in, the, us, at, the, time, cooperation, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, made, possible, the, passage, of, resolutions, in, the, united, nations, security, council, giving, iraq, a, deadline, to, leave, kuwait, and, approving, the, use, of, force, if, saddam, did, not, comply, with, the, timetable, the, united, states, officials, feared, iraqi, retaliation, against, oil, rich, saudi, arabia, since, the, 1940s, a, close, ally, of, washington, for, the, saudis, opposition, to, the, invasion, of, kuwait, accordingly, the, united, states, and, a, group, of, allies, including, countries, as, diverse, as, egypt, syria, and, czechoslovakia, deployed, a, massive, number, of, troops, along, the, saudi, border, with, kuwait, and, iraq, in, order, to, encircle, the, iraqi, army, the, largest, in, the, middle, east, saddam, s, officers, looted, kuwait, stripping, even, the, marble, from, its, palaces, to, move, it, to, saddam, s, own, palace, during, the, period, of, negotiations, and, threats, following, the, invasion, saddam, focused, renewed, attention, on, the, palestinian, problem, by, promising, to, withdraw, his, forces, from, kuwait, if, israel, would, relinquish, the, occupied, territories, in, the, west, bank, the, golan, heights, and, the, gaza, strip, saddam, s, proposal, further, split, the, arab, world, pitting, us, and, western, supported, arab, states, against, the, palestinians, the, allies, ultimately, rejected, any, linkage, between, the, kuwait, crisis, and, palestinian, issues, saddam, ignored, the, security, council, deadline, backed, by, the, security, council, a, us, led, coalition, launched, round, the, clock, missile, and, aerial, attacks, on, iraq, beginning, 16, january, 1991, israel, though, subjected, to, attack, by, iraqi, missiles, refrained, from, retaliating, in, order, not, to, provoke, arab, states, into, leaving, the, coalition, a, ground, force, consisting, largely, of, us, and, british, armored, and, infantry, divisions, ejected, saddam, s, army, from, kuwait, in, february, 1991, and, occupied, the, southern, portion, of, iraq, as, far, as, the, euphrates, on, 6, march, 1991, bush, announced, what, is, at, stake, is, more, than, one, small, country, it, is, a, big, idea, a, new, world, order, where, diverse, nations, are, drawn, together, in, common, cause, to, achieve, the, universal, aspirations, of, mankind, peace, and, security, freedom, and, the, rule, of, law, in, the, end, the, iraqi, army, proved, unable, to, compete, on, the, battlefield, with, the, highly, mobile, coalition, land, forces, and, their, overpowering, air, support, some, 175, 000, iraqis, were, taken, prisoner, and, casualties, were, estimated, at, over, 85, 000, as, part, of, the, cease, fire, agreement, iraq, agreed, to, scrap, all, poison, gas, and, germ, weapons, and, allow, un, observers, to, inspect, the, sites, un, trade, sanctions, would, remain, in, effect, until, iraq, complied, with, all, terms, saddam, publicly, claimed, victory, at, the, end, of, the, war, iraq, s, ethnic, and, religious, divisions, together, with, the, brutality, of, the, conflict, that, this, had, engendered, laid, the, groundwork, for, postwar, rebellions, in, the, aftermath, of, the, fighting, social, and, ethnic, unrest, among, shi, ite, muslims, kurds, and, dissident, military, units, threatened, the, stability, of, saddam, s, government, uprisings, erupted, in, the, kurdish, north, and, shi, a, southern, and, central, parts, of, iraq, but, were, ruthlessly, repressed, uprisings, in, 1991, led, to, the, death, of, 100, 000, 180, 000, people, mostly, civilians, the, us, which, had, urged, iraqis, to, rise, up, against, saddam, did, nothing, to, assist, the, rebellions, the, iranians, despite, the, widespread, shi, ite, rebellions, had, no, interest, in, provoking, another, war, while, turkey, opposed, any, prospect, of, kurdish, independence, and, the, saudis, and, other, conservative, arab, states, feared, an, iran, style, shi, ite, revolution, saddam, having, survived, the, immediate, crisis, in, the, wake, of, defeat, was, left, firmly, in, control, of, iraq, although, the, country, never, recovered, either, economically, or, militarily, from, the, gulf, war, saddam, routinely, cited, his, survival, as, proof, that, iraq, had, in, fact, won, the, war, against, the, us, this, message, earned, saddam, a, great, deal, of, popularity, in, many, sectors, of, the, arab, world, john, esposito, wrote, arabs, and, muslims, were, pulled, in, two, directions, that, they, rallied, not, so, much, to, saddam, hussein, as, to, the, bipolar, nature, of, the, confrontation, the, west, versus, the, arab, muslim, world, and, the, issues, that, saddam, proclaimed, arab, unity, self, sufficiency, and, social, justice, as, a, result, saddam, hussein, appealed, to, many, people, for, the, same, reasons, that, attracted, more, and, more, followers, to, islamic, revivalism, and, also, for, the, same, reasons, that, fueled, anti, western, feelings, one, us, muslim, observer, noted, people, forgot, about, saddam, s, record, and, concentrated, on, america, saddam, hussein, might, be, wrong, but, it, is, not, america, who, should, correct, him, a, shift, was, therefore, clearly, visible, among, many, islamic, movements, in, the, post, war, period, from, an, initial, islamic, ideological, rejection, of, saddam, hussein, the, secular, persecutor, of, islamic, movements, and, his, invasion, of, kuwait, to, a, more, populist, arab, nationalist, anti, imperialist, support, for, saddam, or, more, precisely, those, issues, he, represented, or, championed, and, the, condemnation, of, foreign, intervention, and, occupation, some, elements, of, sharia, law, were, re, introduced, and, the, phrase, allahu, akbar, god, is, great, in, saddam, s, handwriting, was, added, to, the, national, flag, saddam, also, commissioned, the, production, of, a, blood, qur, an, written, using, 27, litres, of, his, own, blood, to, thank, god, for, saving, him, from, various, dangers, and, conspiracies, the, united, nations, placed, sanctions, against, iraq, for, invading, kuwait, were, not, lifted, blocking, iraqi, oil, exports, during, the, late, 1990s, the, un, considered, relaxing, the, sanctions, imposed, because, of, the, hardships, suffered, by, ordinary, iraqis, studies, dispute, the, number, of, people, who, died, in, south, and, central, iraq, during, the, years, of, the, sanctions, on, 9, december, 1996, saddam, s, government, accepted, the, oil, for, food, programme, that, the, un, had, first, offered, in, 1992, relations, between, the, us, and, iraq, remained, tense, following, the, gulf, war, the, us, launched, a, missile, attack, aimed, at, iraq, s, intelligence, headquarters, in, baghdad, 26, june, 1993, citing, evidence, of, repeated, iraqi, violations, of, the, no, fly, zones, imposed, after, the, gulf, war, and, for, incursions, into, kuwait, us, officials, continued, to, accuse, saddam, of, violating, the, terms, of, the, gulf, war, s, cease, fire, by, developing, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, other, banned, weaponry, and, violating, the, un, imposed, sanctions, also, during, the, 1990s, president, bill, clinton, maintained, sanctions, and, ordered, air,
