day, by, millions, of, global, adherents, and, several, churches, the, largest, of, which, is, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, born, in, sharon, vermont, smith, moved, with, his, family, to, western, new, york, following, a, series, of, crop, failures, in, 1816, living, in, an, area, of, intense, religious, revivalism, during, the, second, great, awakening, smith, reported, experiencing, a, series, of, visions, the, first, of, these, was, in, 1820, when, he, saw, two, personages, whom, he, eventually, described, as, god, the, father, and, jesus, christ, in, 1823, he, said, he, was, visited, by, an, angel, who, directed, him, to, a, buried, book, of, golden, plates, inscribed, with, a, judeo, christian, history, of, an, ancient, american, civilization, in, 1830, smith, published, the, book, of, mormon, which, he, described, as, an, english, translation, of, those, plates, the, same, year, he, organized, the, church, of, christ, calling, it, a, restoration, of, the, early, christian, church, members, of, the, church, were, later, called, latter, day, saints, or, mormons, in, 1831, smith, and, his, followers, moved, west, planning, to, build, a, communal, zion, in, the, american, heartland, they, first, gathered, in, kirtland, ohio, and, established, an, outpost, in, independence, missouri, which, was, intended, to, be, zion, s, center, place, during, the, 1830s, smith, sent, out, missionaries, published, revelations, and, supervised, construction, of, the, kirtland, temple, because, of, the, collapse, of, the, church, sponsored, kirtland, safety, society, violent, skirmishes, with, non, mormon, missourians, and, the, mormon, extermination, order, smith, and, his, followers, established, a, new, settlement, at, nauvoo, illinois, of, which, he, was, the, spiritual, and, political, leader, in, 1844, when, the, nauvoo, expositor, criticized, smith, s, power, and, his, practice, of, polygamy, smith, and, the, nauvoo, city, council, ordered, the, destruction, of, its, printing, press, inflaming, anti, mormon, sentiment, fearing, an, invasion, of, nauvoo, smith, rode, to, carthage, illinois, to, stand, trial, but, was, shot, and, killed, by, a, mob, that, stormed, the, jailhouse, during, his, ministry, smith, published, numerous, documents, and, texts, many, of, which, he, attributed, to, divine, inspiration, and, revelation, from, god, he, dictated, the, majority, of, these, in, the, first, person, saying, they, were, the, writings, of, ancient, prophets, or, expressed, the, voice, of, god, his, followers, accepted, his, teachings, as, prophetic, and, revelatory, and, several, of, these, texts, were, canonized, by, denominations, of, the, latter, day, saint, movement, which, continue, to, treat, them, as, scripture, smith, s, teachings, discuss, god, s, nature, cosmology, family, structures, political, organization, and, religious, community, and, authority, mormons, generally, regard, smith, as, a, prophet, comparable, to, moses, and, elijah, several, religious, denominations, identify, as, the, continuation, of, the, church, that, he, organized, including, the, lds, church, and, the, community, of, christ, joseph, smith, was, born, on, december, 23, 1805, in, vermont, on, the, border, between, the, villages, of, south, royalton, and, sharon, to, lucy, mack, smith, and, her, husband, joseph, smith, sr, a, merchant, and, farmer, he, was, one, of, eleven, children, at, the, age, of, seven, smith, had, a, bone, infection, and, after, receiving, surgery, used, crutches, for, three, years, after, an, ill, fated, business, venture, and, three, successive, years, of, crop, failures, culminating, in, the, 1816, year, without, a, summer, the, smith, family, left, vermont, and, moved, to, western, new, york, and, took, out, a, mortgage, on, a, 100, acre, 40, ha, farm, in, the, townships, of, palmyra, and, manchester, the, region, was, a, hotbed, of, religious, enthusiasm, during, the, second, great, awakening, between, 1817, and, 1825, there, were, several, camp, meetings, and, revivals, in, the, palmyra, area, smith, s, parents, disagreed, about, religion, but, the, family, was, caught, up, in, this, excitement, smith, later, recounted, that, he, had, become, interested, in, religion, by, age, 12, and, as, a, teenager, may, have, been, sympathetic, to, methodism, with, other, family, members, he, also, engaged, in, religious, folk, magic, a, relatively, common, practice, in, that, time, and, place, both, his, parents, and, his, maternal, grandfather, reported, having, visions, or, dreams, that, they, believed, communicated, messages, from, god, smith, said, that, although, he, had, become, concerned, about, the, welfare, of, his, soul, he, was, confused, by, the, claims, of, competing, religious, denominations, years, later, smith, wrote, that, he, had, received, a, vision, that, resolved, his, religious, confusion, he, said, that, in, 1820, while, he, had, been, praying, in, a, wooded, area, near, his, home, god, the, father, and, jesus, christ, together, appeared, to, him, told, him, his, sins, were, forgiven, and, said, that, all, contemporary, churches, had, turned, aside, from, the, gospel, smith, said, he, recounted, the, experience, to, a, methodist, minister, who, dismissed, the, story, with, great, contempt, according, to, historian, steven, c, harper, there, is, no, evidence, in, the, historical, record, that, joseph, smith, told, anyone, but, the, minister, of, his, vision, for, at, least, a, decade, and, smith, might, have, kept, it, private, because, of, how, uncomfortable, that, first, dismissal, was, during, the, 1830s, smith, orally, described, the, vision, to, some, of, his, followers, though, it, was, not, widely, published, among, mormons, until, the, 1840s, this, vision, later, grew, in, importance, to, smith, s, followers, who, eventually, regarded, it, as, the, first, event, in, the, restoration, of, christ, s, church, to, earth, smith, himself, may, have, originally, considered, the, vision, to, be, a, personal, conversion, according, to, smith, s, later, accounts, while, praying, one, night, in, 1823, he, was, visited, by, an, angel, named, moroni, smith, claimed, this, angel, revealed, the, location, of, a, buried, book, made, of, golden, plates, as, well, as, other, artifacts, including, a, breastplate, and, a, set, of, interpreters, composed, of, two, seer, stones, set, in, a, frame, which, had, been, hidden, in, a, hill, near, his, home, smith, said, he, attempted, to, remove, the, plates, the, next, morning, but, was, unsuccessful, because, moroni, returned, and, prevented, him, he, reported, that, during, the, next, four, years, he, made, annual, visits, to, the, hill, but, until, the, fourth, and, final, visit, each, time, he, returned, without, the, plates, meanwhile, smith, s, family, faced, financial, hardship, due, in, part, to, the, death, of, his, oldest, brother, alvin, family, members, supplemented, their, meager, farm, income, by, hiring, out, for, odd, jobs, and, working, as, treasure, seekers, a, type, of, magical, supernaturalism, common, during, the, period, smith, was, said, to, have, an, ability, to, locate, lost, items, by, looking, into, a, seer, stone, which, he, also, used, in, treasure, hunting, including, beginning, in, 1825, several, unsuccessful, attempts, to, find, buried, treasure, sponsored, by, josiah, stowell, a, wealthy, farmer, in, chenango, county, in, 1826, smith, was, brought, before, a, chenango, county, court, for, glass, looking, or, pretending, to, find, lost, treasure, stowell, s, relatives, accused, smith, of, tricking, stowell, and, faking, an, ability, to, perceive, hidden, treasure, though, stowell, attested, that, he, believed, smith, had, such, abilities, the, result, of, the, proceeding, remains, unclear, because, primary, sources, report, conflicting, outcomes, while, boarding, at, the, hale, house, located, in, the, township, of, harmony, now, oakland, in, pennsylvania, smith, met, and, courted, emma, hale, when, he, proposed, marriage, her, father, isaac, hale, objected, he, believed, smith, had, no, means, to, support, his, daughter, hale, also, considered, smith, a, stranger, who, appeared, careless, and, not, very, well, educated, smith, and, emma, eloped, and, married, on, january, 18, 1827, after, which, the, couple, began, boarding, with, smith, s, parents, in, manchester, later, that, year, when, smith, promised, to, abandon, treasure, seeking, his, father, in, law, offered, to, let, the, couple, live, on, his, property, in, harmony, and, help, smith, get, started, in, business, smith, made, his, last, visit, to, the, hill, shortly, after, midnight, on, september, 22, 1827, taking, emma, with, him, this, time, he, said, he, successfully, retrieved, the, plates, smith, said, moroni, commanded, him, not, to, show, the, plates, to, anyone, else, but, to, translate, them, and, publish, their, translation, he, also, said, the, plates, were, a, religious, record, of, middle, eastern, indigenous, americans, and, were, engraved, in, an, unknown, language, called, reformed, egyptian, he, told, associates, that, he, was, capable, of, reading, and, translating, them, although, smith, had, abandoned, treasure, hunting, former, associates, believed, he, had, double, crossed, them, and, had, taken, the, golden, plates, for, himself, property, they, believed, should, be, jointly, shared, after, they, ransacked, places, where, they, believed, the, plates, might, have, been, hidden, smith, decided, to, leave, palmyra, in, october, 1827, smith, and, emma, permanently, moved, to, harmony, aided, by, a, relatively, prosperous, neighbor, martin, harris, who, began, serving, as, smith, s, scribe, in, april, 1828, although, he, and, his, wife, lucy, were, early, supporters, of, smith, by, june, 1828, they, began, to, have, doubts, about, the, existence, of, the, golden, plates, harris, persuaded, smith, to, let, him, take, 116, pages, of, manuscript, to, palmyra, to, show, a, few, family, members, including, his, wife, while, harris, had, the, manuscript, in, his, possession, of, which, there, was, no, other, copy, it, was, lost, smith, was, devastated, by, this, loss, especially, since, it, came, at, the, same, time, as, the, death, of, his, first, son, who, died, shortly, after, birth, smith, said, that, as, punishment, for, his, having, lost, the, manuscript, moroni, returned, took, away, the, plates, and, revoked, his, ability, to, translate, during, this, period, smith, briefly, attended, methodist, meetings, with, his, wife, until, a, cousin, of, hers, objected, to, inclusion, of, a, practicing, necromancer, on, the, methodist, class, roll, smith, said, that, moroni, returned, the, plates, to, him, in, september, 1828, and, he, then, dictated, some, of, the, book, to, his, wife, emma, in, april, 1829, he, met, oliver, cowdery, who, had, also, dabbled, in, folk, magic, and, with, cowdery, as, scribe, smith, began, a, period, of, rapid, fire, translation, between, april, and, early, june, 1829, the, two, worked, full, time, on, the, manuscript, then, moved, to, fayette, new, york, where, they, continued, the, work, at, the, home, of, cowdery, s, friend, peter, whitmer, when, the, narrative, described, an, institutional, church, and, a, requirement, for, baptism, smith, and, cowdery, baptized, each, other, dictation, was, completed, about, july, 1, 1829, according, to, smith, moroni, took, back, the, plates, once, smith, finished, using, them, the, completed, work, titled, the, book, of, mormon, was, published, in, palmyra, by, printer, egbert, bratt, grandin, and, was, first, advertised, for, sale, on, march, 26, 1830, less, than, two, weeks, later, on, april, 6, 1830, smith, and, his, followers, formally, organized, the, church, of, christ, and, small, branches, were, established, in, manchester, fayette, and, colesville, new, york, the, book, of, mormon, brought, smith, regional, notoriety, and, renewed, the, hostility, of, those, who, remembered, the, 1826, chenango, county, trial, after, cowdery, baptized, several, new, church, members, smith, s, followers, were, threatened, with, mob, violence, before, smith, could, confirm, the, newly, baptized, he, was, arrested, and, charged, with, being, a, disorderly, person, although, he, was, acquitted, both, he, and, cowdery, fled, to, colesville, to, escape, a, gathering, mob, smith, later, claimed, that, probably, around, this, time, peter, james, and, john, had, appeared, to, him, and, had, ordained, him, and, cowdery, to, a, higher, priesthood, smith, s, authority, was, undermined, when, cowdery, hiram, page, and, other, church, members, also, claimed, to, receive, revelations, in, response, smith, dictated, a, revelation, which, clarified, his, office, as, a, prophet, and, an, apostle, stating, that, only, he, had, the, ability, to, declare, doctrine, and, scripture, for, the, church, smith, then, dispatched, cowdery, peter, whitmer, and, others, on, a, mission, to, proselytize, native, americans, cowdery, was, also, assigned, the, task, of, locating, the, site, of, the, new, jerusalem, which, was, to, be, on, the, borders, of, the, united, states, with, what, was, then, indian, territory, on, their, way, to, missouri, cowdery, s, party, passed, through, northeastern, ohio, where, sidney, rigdon, and, over, a, hundred, followers, of, his, variety, of, campbellite, restorationism, converted, to, the, church, of, christ, swelling, the, ranks, of, the, new, organization, dramatically, after, rigdon, visited, new, york, he, soon, became, smith, s, primary, assistant, with, growing, opposition, in, new, york, smith, announced, a, revelation, that, his, followers, should, gather, to, kirtland, ohio, establish, themselves, as, a, people, and, await, word, from, cowdery, s, mission, when, smith, moved, to, kirtland, in, january, 1831, he, encountered, a, religious, culture, that, included, enthusiastic, demonstrations, of, spiritual, gifts, including, fits, and, trances, rolling, on, the, ground, and, speaking, in, tongues, rigdon, s, followers, were, practicing, a, form, of, communalism, smith, brought, the, kirtland, congregation, under, his, authority, and, tamed, ecstatic, outbursts, he, had, promised, church, elders, that, in, kirtland, they, would, receive, an, endowment, of, heavenly, power, and, at, the, june, 1831, general, conference, he, introduced, the, greater, authority, of, a, high, melchizedek, priesthood, to, the, church, hierarchy, converts, poured, into, kirtland, by, the, summer, of, 1835, there, were, fifteen, hundred, to, two, thousand, latter, day, saints, in, the, vicinity, many, expecting, smith, to, lead, them, shortly, to, the, millennial, kingdom, though, his, mission, to, the, native, americans, had, been, a, failure, cowdery, and, the, other, missionaries, with, him, were, charged, with, finding, a, site, for, a, holy, city, they, found, jackson, county, missouri, after, smith, visited, in, july, 1831, he, pronounced, the, frontier, hamlet, of, independence, the, center, place, of, zion, for, most, of, the, 1830s, the, church, was, effectively, based, in, ohio, smith, lived, there, though, he, visited, missouri, again, in, early, 1832, to, prevent, a, rebellion, of, prominent, church, members, who, believed, the, church, in, missouri, was, being, neglected, smith, s, trip, was, hastened, by, a, mob, of, ohio, residents, who, were, incensed, over, the, church, s, presence, and, smith, s, political, power, the, mob, beat, smith, and, rigdon, unconscious, tarred, and, feathered, them, and, left, them, for, dead, in, jackson, county, existing, missouri, residents, resented, the, latter, day, saint, newcomers, for, both, political, and, religious, reasons, additionally, their, rapid, growth, aroused, fears, that, they, would, soon, constitute, a, majority, in, local, elections, and, thus, rule, the, county, tension, increased, until, july, 1833, when, non, mormons, forcibly, evicted, the, mormons, and, destroyed, their, property, smith, advised, his, followers, to, bear, the, violence, patiently, until, after, they, had, been, attacked, multiple, times, after, which, they, could, fight, back, armed, bands, exchanged, fire, killing, one, mormon, and, two, non, mormons, until, the, old, settlers, forcibly, expelled, the, latter, day, saints, from, the, county, after, petitions, to, missouri, governor, daniel, dunklin, for, aid, were, unsuccessful, smith, organized, and, led, a, small, paramilitary, expedition, called, zion, s, camp, to, aid, the, latter, day, saints, in, missouri, as, a, military, endeavor, the, expedition, was, a, failure, the, men, of, the, expedition, were, disorganized, suffered, from, a, cholera, outbreak, and, were, severely, outnumbered, by, the, end, of, june, smith, deescalated, the, confrontation, sought, peace, with, jackson, county, s, residents, and, disbanded, zion, s, camp, nevertheless, zion, s, camp, transformed, latter, day, saint, leadership, because, many, future, church, leaders, came, from, among, the, participants, after, the, camp, returned, to, ohio, smith, drew, heavily, from, its, participants, to, establish, various, governing, bodies, in, the, church, he, gave, a, revelation, announcing, that, in, order, to, redeem, zion, his, followers, would, have, to, receive, an, endowment, in, the, kirtland, temple, which, he, and, his, followers, constructed, in, march, 1836, at, the, temple, s, dedication, many, who, received, the, endowment, reported, seeing, visions, of, angels, and, engaged, in, prophesying, and, speaking, in, tongues, in, january, 1837, smith, and, other, churchleaders, created, a, joint, stock, company, called, the, kirtland, safety, society, to, act, as, a, quasi, bank, the, company, issued, banknotes, partly, capitalized, by, real, estate, smith, encouraged, his, followers, to, buy, the, notes, in, which, he, invested, heavily, himself, the, bank, failed, within, a, month, as, a, result, latter, day, saints, in, kirtland, suffered, extreme, high, volatility, and, intense, pressure, from, debt, collectors, smith, was, held, responsible, for, the, failure, and, there, were, widespread, defections, from, the, church, including, many, of, smith, s, closest, advisers, the, failure, of, the, bank, was, one, part, of, a, series, of, internal, disputes, led, to, the, demise, of, the, kirtland, community, cowdery, had, accused, smith, of, engaging, in, a, sexual, relationship, with, a, teenage, servant, in, his, home, fanny, alger, construction, of, the, kirtland, temple, had, only, added, to, the, church, s, debt, and, smith, was, hounded, by, creditors, after, a, warrant, was, issued, for, smith, s, arrest, on, a, charge, of, banking, fraud, he, and, rigdon, fled, for, missouri, in, january, 1838, by, 1838, smith, had, abandoned, plans, to, redeem, zion, in, jackson, county, and, instead, declared, the, town, of, far, west, missouri, in, caldwell, county, as, the, new, zion, in, missouri, the, church, also, took, the, name, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, and, construction, began, on, a, new, temple, in, the, weeks, and, months, after, smith, and, rigdon, arrived, at, far, west, thousands, of, latter, day, saints, followed, them, from, kirtland, smith, encouraged, the, settlement, of, land, outside, caldwell, county, instituting, a, settlement, in, adam, ondi, ahman, in, daviess, county, political, and, religious, differences, between, old, missourians, and, newly, arriving, latter, day, saint, settlers, provoked, tensions, between, the, two, groups, much, as, they, had, in, jackson, county, by, this, time, smith, s, experiences, with, mob, violence, led, him, to, believe, that, his, faith, s, survival, required, greater, militancy, against, anti, mormons, tensions, between, the, mormons, and, the, native, missourians, escalated, quickly, until, on, august, 6, 1838, non, mormons, in, gallatin, missouri, tried, to, prevent, mormons, from, voting, and, a, brawl, ensued, the, election, day, scuffles, initiated, the, 1838, mormon, war, non, mormon, vigilantes, raided, and, burned, mormon, farms, while, danites, and, other, mormons, pillaged, non, mormon, towns, in, the, battle, of, crooked, river, a, group, of, mormons, attacked, the, missouri, state, militia, mistakenly, believing, them, to, be, anti, mormon, vigilantes, governor, lilburn, boggs, then, ordered, that, the, mormons, be, exterminated, or, driven, from, the, state, on, october, 30, a, party, of, missourians, surprised, and, killed, seventeen, mormons, in, the, haun, s, mill, massacre, the, following, day, the, mormons, surrendered, to, 2, 500, state, troops, and, agreed, to, forfeit, their, property, and, leave, the, state, smith, was, immediately, brought, before, a, military, court, accused, of, treason, and, sentenced, to, be, executed, the, next, morning, but, alexander, doniphan, who, was, smith, s, former, attorney, and, a, brigadier, general, in, the, missouri, militia, refused, to, carry, out, the, order, smith, was, then, sent, to, a, state, court, for, a, preliminary, hearing, where, several, of, his, former, allies, testified, against, him, smith, and, five, others, including, rigdon, were, charged, with, treason, and, transferred, to, the, jail, at, liberty, missouri, to, await, trial, smith, bore, his, imprisonment, stoically, understanding, that, he, was, effectively, on, trial, before, his, own, people, many, of, whom, considered, him, a, fallen, prophet, he, wrote, a, personal, defense, and, an, apology, for, the, activities, of, his, followers, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, he, wrote, have, not, been, taken, away, from, us, though, he, directed, his, followers, to, collect, and, publish, their, stories, of, persecution, he, also, urged, them, to, moderate, their, antagonism, toward, non, mormons, on, april, 6, 1839, after, a, grand, jury, hearing, in, daviess, county, smith, and, his, companions, escaped, custody, almost, certainly, with, the, connivance, of, the, sheriff, and, guards, many, american, newspapers, criticized, missouri, for, the, haun, s, mill, massacre, and, the, state, s, expulsion, of, the, mormons, illinois, then, accepted, mormon, refugees, who, gathered, along, the, banks, of, the, mississippi, river, where, smith, purchased, high, priced, swampy, woodland, in, the, hamlet, of, commerce, he, attempted, to, portray, the, mormons, as, an, oppressed, minority, and, unsuccessfully, petitioned, the, federal, government, for, help, in, obtaining, reparations, during, the, summer, of, 1839, while, mormons, in, illinois, suffered, from, a, malaria, epidemic, smith, sent, young, and, other, apostles, to, missions, in, europe, where, they, made, numerous, converts, many, of, them, poor, factory, workers, smith, also, attracted, a, few, wealthy, and, influential, converts, including, john, c, bennett, the, illinois, quartermaster, general, bennett, used, his, connections, in, the, illinois, state, legislature, to, obtain, an, unusually, liberal, charter, for, the, new, city, which, smith, renamed, nauvoo, the, charter, granted, the, city, virtual, autonomy, authorized, a, university, and, granted, nauvoo, habeas, corpus, power, which, allowed, smith, to, fend, off, extradition, to, missouri, though, latter, day, saint, authorities, controlled, nauvoo, s, civil, government, the, city, guaranteed, religious, freedom, for, its, residents, the, charter, also, authorized, the, nauvoo, legion, a, militia, whose, actions, were, limited, only, by, state, and, federal, constitutions, smith, and, bennett, became, its, commanders, and, were, styled, lieutenant, general, and, major, general, respectively, as, such, they, controlled, by, far, the, largest, body, of, armed, men, in, illinois, smith, appointed, bennett, as, assistant, president, of, the, church, and, bennett, was, elected, nauvoo, s, first, mayor, the, early, nauvoo, years, were, a, period, of, doctrinal, innovation, smith, introduced, baptism, for, the, dead, in, 1840, and, in, 1841, construction, began, on, the, nauvoo, temple, as, a, place, for, recovering, lost, ancient, knowledge, an, 1841, revelation, promised, the, restoration, of, the, fullness, of, the, priesthood, and, in, may, 1842, smith, inaugurated, a, revised, endowment, or, first, anointing, the, endowment, resembled, the, rites, of, freemasonry, that, smith, had, observed, two, months, earlier, when, he, had, been, initiated, at, sight, into, the, nauvoo, masonic, lodge, at, first, the, endowment, was, open, only, to, men, who, were, initiated, into, a, special, group, called, the, anointed, quorum, for, women, smith, introduced, the, relief, society, a, service, club, and, sorority, within, which, smith, predicted, women, would, receive, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, smith, also, elaborated, on, his, plan, for, a, millennial, kingdom, no, longer, envisioning, the, building, of, zion, in, nauvoo, he, viewed, zion, as, encompassing, all, of, north, and, south, america, with, mormon, settlements, being, stakes, of, zion, s, metaphorical, tent, zion, also, became, less, a, refuge, from, an, impending, tribulation, than, a, great, building, project, in, the, summer, of, 1842, smith, revealed, a, plan, to, establish, the, millennial, kingdom, of, god, which, would, eventually, establish, theocratic, rule, over, the, whole, earth, it, was, around, this, time, that, smith, began, secretly, marrying, additional, wives, a, practice, called, plural, marriage, he, introduced, the, doctrine, to, a, few, of, his, closest, associates, including, bennett, who, used, it, as, an, excuse, to, seduce, numerous, women, wed, and, unwed, when, rumors, of, polygamy, called, spiritual, wifery, by, bennett, got, abroad, smith, forced, bennett, s, resignation, as, nauvoo, mayor, in, retaliation, bennett, left, nauvoo, and, began, publishing, sensational, accusations, against, smith, and, his, followers, by, mid, 1842, popular, opinion, in, illinois, had, turned, against, the, mormons, after, an, unknown, assailant, shot, and, wounded, missouri, governor, lilburn, boggs, in, may, 1842, anti, mormons, circulated, rumors, that, smith, s, bodyguard, porter, rockwell, was, the, gunman, though, the, evidence, was, circumstantial, boggs, ordered, smith, s, extradition, certain, he, would, be, killed, if, he, ever, returned, to, missouri, smith, went, into, hiding, twice, during, the, next, five, months, until, the, u, s, attorney, for, illinois, argued, that, his, extradition, would, be, unconstitutional, rockwell, was, later, tried, and, acquitted, in, june, 1843, enemies, of, smith, convinced, a, reluctant, illinois, governor, thomas, ford, to, extradite, smith, to, missouri, on, an, old, charge, of, treason, two, law, officers, arrested, smith, but, were, intercepted, by, a, party, of, mormons, before, they, could, reach, missouri, smith, was, then, released, on, a, writ, of, habeas, corpus, from, the, nauvoo, municipal, court, while, this, ended, the, missourians, attempts, at, extradition, it, caused, significant, political, fallout, in, illinois, in, december, 1843, smith, petitioned, congress, to, make, nauvoo, an, independent, territory, with, the, right, to, call, out, federal, troops, in, its, defense, smith, then, wrote, to, the, leading, presidential, candidates, asking, what, they, would, do, to, protect, the, mormons, after, receiving, noncommittal, or, negative, responses, he, announced, his, own, independent, candidacy, for, president, of, the, united, states, suspended, regular, proselytizing, and, sent, out, the, quorum, of, the, twelve, and, hundreds, of, other, political, missionaries, in, march, 1844, following, a, dispute, with, a, federal, bureaucrat, he, organized, the, secret, council, of, fifty, which, was, given, the, authority, to, decide, which, national, or, state, laws, mormons, should, obey, as, well, as, establish, its, own, government, for, mormons, before, his, death, the, council, also, voted, unanimously, to, elect, smith, prophet, priest, and, king, the, council, was, likewise, appointed, to, select, a, site, for, a, large, mormon, settlement, in, the, republic, of, texas, oregon, or, california, then, controlled, by, mexico, where, mormons, could, live, under, theocratic, law, beyond, the, control, of, other, governments, by, early, 1844, a, rift, developed, between, smith, and, a, half, dozen, of, his, closest, associates, most, notably, william, law, his, trusted, counselor, and, robert, foster, a, general, of, the, nauvoo, legion, disagreed, with, smith, about, how, to, manage, nauvoo, s, economy, both, also, said, that, smith, had, proposed, marriage, to, their, wives, believing, these, men, were, plotting, against, his, life, smith, excommunicated, them, on, april, 18, 1844, law, and, foster, subsequently, formed, a, competing, reform, church, and, in, the, following, month, at, the, county, seat, in, carthage, they, procured, indictments, against, smith, for, perjury, as, smith, publicly, denied, having, more, than, one, wife, and, polygamy, on, june, 7, the, dissidents, published, the, first, and, only, issue, of, the, nauvoo, expositor, calling, for, reform, within, the, church, but, also, appealing, politically, to, non, mormons, the, paper, alluded, to, smith, s, theocratic, aspirations, called, for, a, repeal, of, the, nauvoo, city, charter, and, decried, his, new, doctrines, of, many, gods, smith, had, recently, given, his, king, follett, discourse, in, which, he, said, that, god, was, once, a, man, and, that, men, and, women, could, become, gods, it, also, attacked, smith, s, practice, of, polygamy, implying, that, he, was, using, religion, as, a, pretext, to, draw, unassuming, women, to, nauvoo, to, seduce, and, marry, them, fearing, the, expositor, would, provoke, a, new, round, of, violence, against, the, mormons, the, nauvoo, city, council, declared, the, newspaper, a, public, nuisance, and, smith, ordered, the, nauvoo, legion, to, assist, the, police, force, in, destroying, its, printing, press, during, the, council, debate, smith, vigorously, urged, the, council, to, order, the, press, destroyed, not, realizing, that, destroying, a, newspaper, was, more, likely, to, incite, an, attack, than, any, of, the, newspaper, s, accusations, destruction, of, the, newspaper, provoked, a, strident, call, to, arms, from, thomas, c, sharp, editor, of, the, warsaw, signal, and, longtime, critic, of, smith, fearing, mob, violence, smith, mobilized, the, nauvoo, legion, on, june, 18, and, declared, martial, law, officials, in, carthage, responded, by, mobilizing, a, small, detachment, of, the, state, militia, and, governor, ford, intervened, threatening, to, raise, a, larger, militia, unless, smith, and, the, nauvoo, city, council, surrendered, themselves, smith, initially, fled, across, the, mississippi, river, but, shortly, returned, and, surrendered, to, ford, on, june, 25, smith, and, his, brother, hyrum, arrived, in, carthage, to, stand, trial, for, inciting, a, riot, once, the, smiths, were, in, custody, the, charges, were, increased, to, treason, preventing, them, from, posting, bail, john, taylor, and, willard, richards, voluntarily, accompanied, the, smiths, in, carthage, jail, on, june, 27, 1844, an, armed, mob, with, blackened, faces, stormed, carthage, jail, where, joseph, and, hyrum, were, being, detained, hyrum, who, was, trying, to, secure, the, door, was, killed, instantly, with, a, shot, to, the, face, smith, fired, three, shots, from, a, pepper, box, pistol, that, his, friend, cyrus, h, wheelock, had, lent, him, wounding, three, men, before, he, sprang, for, the, window, smith, and, his, companions, were, staying, in, the, jailer, s, bedroom, which, did, not, have, bars, on, the, windows, he, was, shot, multiple, times, before, falling, out, of, the, window, crying, oh, lord, my, god, he, died, shortly, after, hitting, the, ground, but, was, shot, several, more, times, by, an, improvised, firing, squad, before, the, mob, dispersed, following, smith, s, death, non, mormon, newspapers, were, nearly, unanimous, in, portraying, smith, as, a, religious, fanatic, conversely, within, the, latter, day, saint, community, smith, was, viewed, as, a, prophet, martyred, to, seal, the, testimony, of, his, faith, after, a, public, funeral, and, viewing, of, the, deceased, brothers, smith, s, widow, who, feared, hostile, non, mormons, might, try, to, desecrate, the, bodies, had, their, remains, buried, at, night, in, a, secret, location, with, substitute, coffins, filled, with, sandbags, interred, in, the, publicly, attested, grave, the, bodies, were, later, moved, and, reburied, under, an, outbuilding, on, the, smith, property, off, the, mississippi, river, members, of, the, reorganized, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, rlds, church, under, the, direction, of, then, rlds, church, president, frederick, m, smith, smith, s, grandson, searched, for, located, and, disinterred, the, smith, brothers, remains, in, 1928, and, reinterred, them, along, with, smith, s, wife, in, nauvoo, at, the, smith, family, cemetery, modern, biographers, and, scholars, mormon, and, non, mormon, alike, agree, that, smith, was, one, of, the, most, influential, charismatic, and, innovative, figures, in, american, religious, history, in, a, 2015, compilation, of, the, 100, most, significant, americans, of, all, time, smithsonian, ranked, smith, first, in, the, category, of, religious, figures, in, popular, opinion, non, mormons, in, the, u, s, generally, consider, smith, a, charlatan, scoundrel, and, heretic, while, outside, the, u, s, he, is, obscure, within, the, latter, day, saint, movement, smith, s, legacy, varies, between, denominations, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, and, its, members, consider, smith, the, founding, prophet, of, their, church, on, par, with, moses, and, elijah, meanwhile, smith, s, reputation, is, ambivalent, in, the, community, of, christ, which, continues, honoring, his, role, in, the, church, s, founding, history, but, deemphasizes, his, human, leadership, conversely, woolleyite, mormon, fundamentalism, has, deified, smith, within, a, cosmology, of, many, gods, memorials, to, smith, include, the, joseph, smith, memorial, building, in, salt, lake, city, utah, the, former, joseph, smith, memorial, building, on, the, campus, of, brigham, young, university, as, well, as, the, current, joseph, smith, building, there, a, granite, obelisk, marking, smith, s, birthplace, and, a, fifteen, foot, tall, bronze, statue, of, smith, in, the, world, peace, dome, in, pune, india, smith, s, death, resulted, in, a, succession, crisis, within, the, latter, day, saint, movement, he, had, proposed, several, ways, to, choose, his, successor, but, never, clarified, his, preference, the, two, strongest, succession, candidates, were, young, senior, member, and, president, of, the, quorum, of, the, twelve, apostles, and, rigdon, the, senior, remaining, member, of, the, first, presidency, in, a, church, wide, conference, on, august, 8, most, of, the, latter, day, saints, present, elected, young, they, eventually, left, nauvoo, and, settled, the, salt, lake, valley, utah, territory, nominal, membership, in, young, s, denomination, which, became, the, lds, church, surpassed, 17, million, in, 2023, smaller, groups, followed, rigdon, and, james, j, strang, who, had, based, his, claim, on, a, letter, of, appointment, ostensibly, written, by, smith, but, which, some, scholars, believe, was, forged, some, hundreds, followed, lyman, wight, to, establish, a, community, in, texas, others, followed, alpheus, cutler, many, members, of, these, smaller, groups, including, most, of, smith, s, family, eventually, coalesced, in, 1860, under, the, leadership, of, joseph, smith, iii, and, formed, the, rlds, church, now, the, community, of, christ, which, now, has, about, 250, 000, members, the, first, of, smith, s, wives, emma, hale, gave, birth, to, nine, children, during, their, marriage, five, of, whom, died, before, the, age, of, two, the, eldest, alvin, born, in, 1828, died, within, hours, of, birth, as, did, twins, thaddeus, and, louisa, born, in, 1831, when, the, twins, died, the, smiths, adopted, another, set, of, twins, julia, and, joseph, murdock, whose, mother, had, recently, died, in, childbirth, the, adopted, smith, died, of, measles, in, 1832, in, 1841, don, carlos, who, had, been, born, a, year, earlier, died, of, malaria, and, five, months, later, in, 1842, emma, gave, birth, to, a, stillborn, son, joseph, and, emma, had, five, children, who, lived, to, maturity, adopted, julia, murdock, joseph, smith, iii, david, hyrum, smith, frederick, granger, williams, smith, and, alexander, hale, smith, some, historians, have, speculated, based, on, journal, entries, and, family, stories, that, smith, fathered, children, with, his, plural, wives, however, in, cases, where, dna, testing, of, potential, smith, descendants, from, plural, wives, has, been, possible, results, have, been, negative, after, smith, s, death, emma, was, quickly, alienated, from, young, and, the, lds, leadership, emma, feared, and, despised, young, who, in, turn, was, suspicious, of, emma, s, desire, to, preserve, the, family, s, assets, from, inclusion, with, those, of, the, church, he, also, disliked, her, open, opposition, to, plural, marriage, young, excluded, emma, from, ecclesiastical, meetings, and, from, social, gatherings, when, most, mormons, moved, west, emma, stayed, in, nauvoo, and, married, a, non, mormon, major, lewis, c, bidamon, she, withdrew, from, religion, until, 1860, when, she, affiliated, with, the, rlds, church, headed, by, her, son, joseph, iii, emma, maintained, her, belief, that, smith, had, been, a, prophet, and, she, never, repudiated, her, belief, in, the, authenticity, of, the, book, of, mormon, by, some, accounts, smith, had, been, teaching, a, polygamy, doctrine, as, early, as, 1831, and, there, is, evidence, that, he, may, have, been, a, polygamist, by, 1835, although, the, church, had, publicly, repudiated, polygamy, in, 1837, there, was, a, rift, between, smith, and, cowdery, over, the, issue, cowdery, suspected, smith, had, engaged, in, a, relationship, with, fanny, alger, who, worked, in, the, smith, household, as, a, serving, girl, smith, did, not, deny, having, a, relationship, but, he, insisted, that, he, had, never, admitted, to, adultery, presumably, historian, bushman, argues, because, he, had, married, alger, as, a, plural, wife, in, april, 1841, smith, secretly, wed, louisa, beaman, and, during, the, next, two, and, a, half, years, he, secretly, married, or, was, sealed, to, about, thirty, or, forty, additional, women, ten, of, his, plural, wives, were, between, the, ages, of, fourteen, and, twenty, others, were, over, fifty, ten, were, already, married, to, other, men, though, some, of, these, polyandrous, marriages, were, contracted, with, the, consent, of, the, first, husbands, evidence, for, whether, or, not, and, to, what, degree, smith, s, polygamous, marriages, involved, sex, is, ambiguous, and, varies, between, marriages, some, polygamous, marriages, may, have, been, considered, solely, religious, marriages, that, would, not, take, effect, until, after, death, in, any, case, during, smith, s, lifetime, the, practice, of, polygamy, was, kept, secret, from, both, non, mormons, and, most, members, of, the, church, polygamy, caused, a, breach, between, smith, and, his, first, wife, emma, historian, laurel, thatcher, ulrich, summarizes, by, stating, that, emma, vacillated, in, her, support, for, plural, marriage, sometimes, acquiescing, to, joseph, s, sealings, sometimes, resisting, according, to, bushman, the, signal, feature, of, smith, s, life, was, his, sense, of, being, guided, by, revelation, instead, of, presenting, his, ideas, with, logical, arguments, smith, dictated, authoritative, scripture, like, revelations, and, let, people, decide, whether, to, believe, doing, so, with, what, peter, coviello, calls, beguiling, offhandedness, smith, and, his, followers, treated, his, revelations, as, being, above, teachings, or, opinions, and, he, acted, as, though, he, believed, in, his, revelations, as, much, as, his, followers, the, revelations, were, written, as, if, god, himself, were, speaking, through, smith, often, opening, with, words, such, as, hearken, o, ye, people, which, profess, my, name, saith, the, lord, your, god, the, book, of, mormon, has, been, called, the, longest, and, most, complex, of, smith, s, revelations, its, language, resembles, the, king, james, version, of, the, bible, as, does, its, organization, as, a, compilation, of, smaller, books, each, named, after, prominent, figures, in, the, narrative, it, tells, the, story, of, the, rise, and, fall, of, a, judeo, christian, religious, civilization, in, the, western, hemisphere, beginning, about, 600, bc, and, ending, in, the, fifth, century, the, book, explains, itself, to, be, largely, the, work, of, mormon, a, nephite, prophet, and, military, figure, christian, themes, permeate, the, work, some, scholars, have, considered, the, book, of, mormon, a, response, to, pressing, cultural, and, environmental, issues, in, smith, s, day, historian, dan, vogel, regards, the, book, as, autobiographical, in, nature, reflecting, smith, s, life, and, perceptions, biographer, robert, v, remini, calls, the, book, of, mormon, a, typically, american, story, that, radiates, the, revivalist, passion, of, the, second, great, awakening, brodie, suggested, that, smith, composed, the, book, of, mormon, by, drawing, on, sources, of, information, available, to, him, such, as, the, 1823, book, view, of, the, hebrews, other, scholars, argue, the, book, of, mormon, is, more, biblical, in, inspiration, than, american, bushman, writes, that, the, book, of, mormon, is, not, a, conventional, american, book, and, that, its, structure, better, resembles, the, bible, according, to, historian, daniel, walker, howe, the, book, s, dominant, themes, are, biblical, prophetic, and, patriarchal, not, democratic, or, optimistic, like, the, prevailing, american, culture, shipps, argues, that, the, book, of, mormon, s, complex, set, of, religious, claims, provided, the, basis, of, a, new, mythos, or, story, which, early, converts, accepted, and, lived, in, as, their, world, thus, departing, from, the, early, national, period, in, america, into, a, new, dispensation, of, the, fulness, of, times, smith, never, fully, described, how, he, produced, the, book, of, mormon, saying, only, that, he, translated, by, the, power, of, god, and, implying, that, he, had, read, its, words, the, book, of, mormon, itself, states, only, that, its, text, will, come, forth, by, the, gift, and, power, of, god, unto, the, interpretation, thereof, accordingly, there, is, considerable, disagreement, about, the, actual, method, used, for, at, least, some, of, the, earliest, dictation, smith, s, compatriots, said, he, used, the, urim, and, thummim, a, pair, of, seer, stones, he, said, were, buried, with, the, plates, however, people, close, to, smith, said, that, later, in, the, process, of, dictation, he, used, a, chocolate, colored, stone, he, had, found, in, 1822, that, he, had, used, previously, for, treasure, hunting, joseph, knight, said, that, smith, saw, the, words, of, the, translation, while, after, excluding, all, light, he, gazed, at, the, stone, or, stones, in, the, bottom, of, his, hat, a, process, similar, to, divining, the, location, of, treasure, sometimes, smith, concealed, the, process, by, raising, a, curtain, or, dictating, from, another, room, at, other, times, he, dictated, in, full, view, of, witnesses, while, the, plates, lay, covered, on, the, table, or, were, hidden, elsewhere, in, june, 1830, smith, dictated, a, revelation, in, which, moses, narrates, a, vision, in, which, he, sees, worlds, without, number, and, speaks, with, god, about, the, purpose, of, creation, and, the, relation, of, humankind, to, deity, this, revelation, initiated, a, revision, of, the, bible, which, smith, worked, on, sporadically, until, 1833, but, which, remained, unpublished, until, after, his, death, he, may, have, considered, it, complete, though, according, to, emma, smith, the, biblical, revision, was, still, unfinished, when, joseph, died, in, the, course, of, producing, the, book, of, mormon, smith, declared, that, the, bible, was, missing, the, most, plain, and, precious, parts, of, the, gospel, he, produced, a, new, translation, of, the, bible, not, by, directly, translating, from, manuscripts, in, another, language, but, by, amending, and, appending, to, a, king, james, bible, in, a, process, which, he, and, latter, day, saints, believed, was, guided, by, inspiration, smith, asserted, his, translation, would, correct, lacunae, and, restore, what, the, contemporary, bible, was, missing, while, many, changes, involved, straightening, out, seeming, contradictions, or, making, small, clarifications, other, changes, added, large, interpolations, to, the, text, for, example, smith, s, revision, nearly, tripled, the, length, of, the, first, five, chapters, of, genesis, into, a, text, called, the, book, of, moses, in, 1835, smith, encouraged, some, latter, day, saints, in, kirtland, to, purchase, rolls, of, ancient, egyptian, papyri, from, a, traveling, exhibitor, he, said, they, contained, the, writings, of, the, ancient, patriarchs, abraham, and, joseph, over, the, next, several, years, smith, dictated, to, scribes, what, he, reported, was, a, revelatory, translation, of, one, of, these, rolls, which, was, published, in, 1842, as, the, book, of, abraham, the, book, of, abraham, speaks, of, the, founding, of, the, abrahamic, nation, astronomy, cosmology, lineage, and, priesthood, and, gives, another, account, of, the, creation, story, the, papyri, associated, with, the, book, of, abraham, were, thought, to, have, been, lost, in, the, great, chicago, fire, but, several, fragments, were, rediscovered, in, the, 1960s, egyptologists, have, subsequently, determined, them, to, be, part, of, the, egyptian, book, of, breathing, with, no, connection, to, abraham, in, his, revisions, of, the, bible, and, production, of, the, book, of, abraham, he, taught, that, black, people, were, cursed, by, god, with, the, curses, placed, on, cain, and, ham, and, linked, the, two, curses, by, positioning, ham, s, canaanite, posterity, as, matrilinear, descendants, of, cain, 22, 29, 31, 54, 57, in, another, book, of, the, pearl, of, great, price, the, descendants, of, cain, are, described, as, dark, skinned, 11, 12, 128, he, referred, to, the, curses, as, a, justification, for, slavery, 126, 27, may, give, you, sudden, strokes, of, ideas, so, that, by, noticing, it, you, may, find, it, fulfilled, the, same, day, or, soon, those, things, that, were, presented, unto, your, minds, by, the, spirit, of, god, will, come, to, pass, joseph, smith, according, to, pratt, smith, dictated, his, revelations, which, were, recorded, by, a, scribe, without, revisions, or, corrections, revelations, were, immediately, copied, and, then, circulated, among, church, members, smith, s, revelations, often, came, in, response, to, specific, questions, he, described, the, revelatory, process, as, having, pure, intelligence, flowing, into, him, smith, however, never, viewed, the, wording, to, be, infallible, the, revelations, were, not, god, s, words, verbatim, but, couched, in, language, suitable, to, joseph, s, time, in, 1833, smith, edited, and, expanded, many, of, the, previous, revelations, publishing, them, as, the, book, of, commandments, which, later, became, part, of, the, doctrine, and, covenants, smith, gave, varying, types, of, revelations, some, were, temporal, while, others, were, spiritual, or, doctrinal, some, were, received, for, a, specific, individual, while, others, were, directed, at, the, whole, church, an, 1831, revelation, called, the, law, contained, directions, for, missionary, work, rules, for, organizing, society, in, zion, a, reiteration, of, the, ten, commandments, an, injunction, to, administer, to, the, poor, and, needy, and, an, outline, for, the, law, of, consecration, an, 1832, revelation, called, the, vision, added, to, the, fundamentals, of, sin, and, atonement, and, introduced, doctrines, of, life, after, salvation, exaltation, and, a, heaven, with, degrees, of, glory, another, 1832, revelation, was, the, first, to, explain, priesthood, doctrine, in, 1833, at, a, time, of, temperance, agitation, smith, delivered, a, revelation, called, the, word, of, wisdom, which, counseled, a, diet, of, wholesome, herbs, fruits, grains, and, a, sparing, use, of, meat, it, also, recommended, that, latter, day, saints, avoid, strong, alcoholic, drinks, tobacco, and, hot, drinks, later, interpreted, to, mean, tea, and, coffee, the, word, of, wisdom, was, originally, framed, as, a, recommendation, rather, than, a, commandment, and, was, not, strictly, followed, by, smith, and, other, early, latter, day, saints, though, it, later, became, a, requirement, in, the, lds, church, before, 1832, most, of, smith, s, revelations, concerned, establishing, the, church, gathering, followers, and, building, the, city, of, zion, later, revelations, dealt, primarily, with, the, priesthood, endowment, and, exaltation, the, pace, of, formal, revelations, slowed, during, the, autumn, of, 1833, and, again, after, the, dedication, of, the, kirtland, temple, smith, moved, away, from, formal, written, revelations, spoken, in, god, s, voice, and, instead, taught, more, in, sermons, conversations, and, letters, for, instance, the, doctrines, of, baptism, for, the, dead, and, the, nature, of, god, were, introduced, in, sermons, and, one, of, smith, s, most, famed, statements, about, there, being, no, such, thing, as, immaterial, matter, was, recorded, from, a, casual, conversation, with, a, methodist, preacher, smith, taught, that, all, existence, was, material, including, a, world, of, spirit, matter, so, fine, that, it, was, invisible, to, all, but, the, purest, mortal, eyes, matter, in, smith, s, view, could, be, neither, created, nor, destroyed, the, creation, involved, only, the, reorganization, of, existing, matter, like, matter, smith, saw, intelligence, as, co, eternal, with, god, and, he, taught, that, human, spirits, had, been, drawn, from, a, pre, existent, pool, of, eternal, intelligences, nevertheless, according, to, smith, spirits, could, not, experience, a, fullness, of, joy, unless, joined, with, corporeal, bodies, therefore, the, work, and, glory, of, god, was, to, create, worlds, across, the, cosmos, where, inferior, intelligences, could, be, embodied, smith, taught, that, god, was, an, advanced, and, glorified, man, embodied, within, time, and, space, he, publicly, taught, that, god, the, father, and, jesus, were, distinct, beings, with, physical, bodies, nevertheless, he, conceived, of, the, holy, spirit, as, a, personage, of, spirit, smith, extended, this, materialist, conception, to, all, existence, and, taught, that, all, spirit, is, matter, meaning, that, a, person, s, embodiment, in, flesh, was, not, a, sign, of, fallen, carnality, but, a, divine, quality, that, humans, shared, with, deity, humans, are, therefore, not, so, much, god, s, creations, as, they, are, god, s, kin, there, is, also, considerable, evidence, that, smith, taught, at, least, to, limited, audiences, that, god, the, father, was, accompanied, by, god, the, mother, in, this, conception, god, fully, understood, is, plural, embodied, gendered, and, both, male, and, female, through, the, gradual, acquisition, of, knowledge, according, to, smith, those, who, received, exaltation, could, eventually, become, like, god, these, teachings, implied, a, vast, hierarchy, of, gods, with, god, himself, having, a, father, in, smith, s, cosmology, those, who, became, gods, would, reign, unified, in, purpose, and, will, leading, spirits, of, lesser, capacity, to, share, immortality, and, eternal, life, in, smith, s, view, the, opportunity, to, achieve, godhood, also, called, exaltation, extended, to, all, humanity, those, who, died, with, no, opportunity, to, accept, saving, ordinances, could, achieve, exaltation, by, accepting, them, in, the, afterlife, through, proxy, ordinances, performed, on, their, behalf, smith, said, that, children, who, died, in, their, innocence, would, be, guaranteed, to, rise, at, the, resurrection, and, receive, exaltation, apart, from, those, who, committed, the, eternal, sin, smith, taught, that, even, the, wicked, and, disbelieving, would, achieve, a, degree, of, glory, in, the, afterlife, smith, s, teachings, were, rooted, in, dispensational, restorationism, he, taught, that, the, church, of, christ, restored, through, him, was, a, latter, day, restoration, of, the, early, christian, faith, which, had, been, lost, in, the, great, apostasy, at, first, smith, s, church, had, little, sense, of, hierarchy, and, his, religious, authority, was, derived, from, his, visions, and, revelations, though, he, did, not, claim, exclusive, prophethood, an, early, revelation, designated, him, as, the, only, prophet, allowed, to, issue, commandments, as, moses, this, religious, authority, included, economic, and, political, as, well, as, spiritual, matters, for, instance, in, the, early, 1830s, smith, temporarily, instituted, a, form, of, religious, communism, called, the, united, order, that, required, latter, day, saints, to, give, all, their, property, to, the, church, to, be, divided, among, the, faithful, he, also, envisioned, that, the, theocratic, institutions, he, established, would, have, a, role, in, the, worldwide, political, organization, of, the, millennium, by, the, mid, 1830s, smith, began, teaching, a, hierarchy, of, three, priesthoods, the, melchizedek, the, aaronic, and, the, patriarchal, each, priesthood, was, a, continuation, of, biblical, priesthoods, through, lineal, succession, or, through, ordination, by, biblical, figures, appearing, in, visions, upon, introducing, the, melchizedek, or, high, priesthood, in, 1831, smith, taught, that, its, recipients, would, be, endowed, with, power, from, on, high, fulfilling, a, desire, for, a, greater, holiness, and, an, authority, commensurate, with, the, new, testament, apostles, this, doctrine, of, endowment, evolved, through, the, 1830s, until, in, 1842, the, nauvoo, endowment, included, an, elaborate, ceremony, containing, elements, similar, to, those, of, freemasonry, and, the, jewish, kabbalah, although, the, endowment, was, extended, to, women, in, 1843, smith, never, clarified, whether, women, could, be, ordained, to, priesthood, offices, smith, taught, that, the, high, priesthood, s, endowment, of, heavenly, power, included, the, sealing, powers, of, elijah, allowing, high, priests, to, perform, ceremonies, with, effects, that, continued, after, death, for, example, this, power, would, enable, proxy, baptisms, for, the, dead, and, marriages, that, would, last, into, eternity, elijah, s, sealing, powers, also, enabled, the, second, anointing, or, fulness, of, the, priesthood, which, according, to, smith, sealed, married, couples, to, their, exaltation, during, the, early, 1840s, smith, unfolded, a, theology, of, family, relations, called, the, new, and, everlasting, covenant, that, superseded, all, earthly, bonds, he, taught, that, outside, the, covenant, marriages, were, simply, matters, of, contract, and, that, in, the, afterlife, individuals, who, were, unmarried, or, who, married, outside, the, covenant, would, be, limited, in, their, progression, towards, godhood, to, fully, enter, the, covenant, a, man, and, woman, must, participate, in, a, first, anointing, a, sealing, ceremony, and, a, second, anointing, also, called, sealing, by, the, holy, spirit, of, promise, when, fully, sealed, into, the, covenant, smith, said, that, no, sin, nor, blasphemy, other, than, murder, and, apostasy, could, keep, them, from, their, exaltation, in, the, afterlife, according, to, a, revelation, smith, dictated, god, appointed, only, one, person, on, earth, at, a, time, in, this, case, smith, to, possess, this, power, of, sealing, according, to, smith, men, and, women, needed, to, be, sealed, to, each, other, in, this, new, and, everlasting, covenant, also, called, celestial, marriage, in, order, to, be, exalted, in, heaven, after, death, and, that, such, celestial, marriage, perpetuated, across, generations, could, reunite, extended, families, of, ancestors, and, descendants, in, the, afterlife, plural, marriage, or, polygamy, was, smith, s, most, famous, innovation, according, to, historian, matthew, bowman, once, smith, introduced, polygamy, it, became, part, of, his, abrahamic, project, in, the, phrasing, of, historian, benjamin, park, wherein, the, solution, to, humanity, s, chaos, would, be, found, through, accepting, the, divine, order, of, the, cosmos, under, god, s, authority, in, a, fusion, of, ecclesiastical, and, civic, authority, smith, also, taught, that, the, highest, level, of, exaltation, could, be, achieved, through, polygamy, the, ultimate, manifestation, of, the, new, and, everlasting, covenant, in, smith, s, theology, marrying, in, polygamy, made, it, possible, for, practitioners, to, unlearn, the, christian, tradition, which, identified, the, physical, body, as, carnal, and, to, instead, recognize, their, embodied, joy, as, sacred, smith, also, taught, that, the, practice, allowed, an, individual, to, transcend, the, angelic, state, and, become, a, god, accelerating, the, expansion, of, one, s, heavenly, kingdom
