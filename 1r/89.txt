alessandro, di, mariano, di, vanni, filipepi, c, 1445, may, 17, 1510, better, known, as, sandro, botticelli, b, t, t, l, i, bot, ih, chel, ee, italian, or, simply, botticelli, was, an, italian, painter, of, the, early, renaissance, botticelli, s, posthumous, reputation, suffered, until, the, late, 19th, century, when, he, was, rediscovered, by, the, pre, raphaelites, who, stimulated, a, reappraisal, of, his, work, since, then, his, paintings, have, been, seen, to, represent, the, linear, grace, of, late, italian, gothic, and, some, early, renaissance, painting, even, though, they, date, from, the, latter, half, of, the, italian, renaissance, period, in, addition, to, the, mythological, subjects, for, which, he, is, best, known, today, botticelli, painted, a, wide, range, of, religious, subjects, including, dozens, of, renditions, of, the, madonna, and, child, many, in, the, round, tondo, shape, and, also, some, portraits, his, best, known, works, are, the, birth, of, venus, and, primavera, both, in, the, uffizi, in, florence, which, holds, many, of, botticelli, s, works, botticelli, lived, all, his, life, in, the, same, neighbourhood, of, florence, his, only, significant, times, elsewhere, were, the, months, he, spent, painting, in, pisa, in, 1474, and, the, sistine, chapel, in, rome, in, 1481, 82, only, one, of, botticelli, s, paintings, the, mystic, nativity, national, gallery, london, is, inscribed, with, a, date, 1501, but, others, can, be, dated, with, varying, degrees, of, certainty, on, the, basis, of, archival, records, so, the, development, of, his, style, can, be, traced, with, some, confidence, he, was, an, independent, master, for, all, the, 1470s, which, saw, his, reputation, soar, the, 1480s, were, his, most, successful, decade, the, one, in, which, his, large, mythological, paintings, were, completed, along, with, many, of, his, most, famous, madonnas, by, the, 1490s, his, style, became, more, personal, and, to, some, extent, mannered, his, last, works, show, him, moving, in, a, direction, opposite, to, that, of, leonardo, da, vinci, seven, years, his, junior, and, the, new, generation, of, painters, creating, the, high, renaissance, style, and, instead, returning, to, a, style, that, many, have, described, as, more, gothic, or, archaic, botticelli, was, born, in, the, city, of, florence, in, a, house, on, the, street, still, called, borgo, ognissanti, he, lived, in, the, same, area, all, his, life, and, was, buried, in, his, neighbourhood, church, called, ognissanti, all, saints, sandro, was, one, of, several, children, to, the, tanner, mariano, di, vanni, d, amedeo, filipepi, and, his, wife, smeralda, filipepi, and, the, youngest, of, the, four, who, survived, into, adulthood, the, date, of, his, birth, is, not, known, but, his, father, s, tax, returns, in, following, years, give, his, age, as, two, in, 1447, and, thirteen, in, 1458, meaning, he, must, have, been, born, between, 1444, and, 1446, in, 1460, botticelli, s, father, ceased, his, business, as, a, tanner, and, became, a, gold, beater, with, his, other, son, antonio, this, profession, would, have, brought, the, family, into, contact, with, a, range, of, artists, giorgio, vasari, in, his, life, of, botticelli, reported, that, botticelli, was, initially, trained, as, a, goldsmith, the, ognissanti, neighbourhood, was, a, modest, one, inhabited, by, weavers, and, other, workmen, but, there, were, some, rich, families, most, notably, the, rucellai, a, wealthy, clan, of, bankers, and, wool, merchants, the, family, s, head, giovanni, di, paolo, rucellai, commissioned, the, famous, palazzo, rucellai, a, landmark, in, italian, renaissance, architecture, from, leon, battista, alberti, between, 1446, and, 1451, botticelli, s, earliest, years, by, 1458, botticelli, s, family, was, renting, their, house, from, the, rucellai, which, was, just, one, of, many, dealings, that, involved, the, two, families, in, 1464, his, father, bought, a, house, in, the, nearby, via, nuova, now, called, via, della, porcellana, in, which, sandro, lived, from, 1470, if, not, earlier, until, his, death, in, 1510, botticelli, both, lived, and, worked, in, the, house, a, rather, unusual, practice, despite, his, brothers, giovanni, and, simone, also, being, resident, there, the, family, s, most, notable, neighbours, were, the, vespucci, including, amerigo, vespucci, after, whom, the, americas, were, named, the, vespucci, were, medici, allies, and, eventually, regular, patrons, of, botticelli, the, nickname, botticelli, meaning, little, barrel, derives, from, the, nickname, of, sandro, s, brother, giovanni, who, was, called, botticello, apparently, because, of, his, round, stature, a, document, of, 1470, refers, to, sandro, as, sandro, mariano, botticelli, meaning, that, he, had, fully, adopted, the, name, from, around, 1461, or, 1462, botticelli, was, apprenticed, to, fra, filippo, lippi, one, of, the, leading, florentine, painters, and, a, favorite, of, the, medici, it, was, from, lippi, that, botticelli, learned, how, to, create, intimate, compositions, with, beautiful, melancholic, figures, drawn, with, clear, contours, and, only, slight, contrasts, of, light, and, shadow, for, much, of, this, period, lippi, was, based, in, prato, a, few, miles, west, of, florence, frescoing, the, apse, of, what, is, now, prato, cathedral, botticelli, probably, left, lippi, s, workshop, by, april, 1467, when, the, latter, went, to, work, in, spoleto, there, has, been, much, speculation, as, to, whether, botticelli, spent, a, shorter, period, of, time, in, another, workshop, such, as, that, of, the, pollaiuolo, brothers, or, andrea, del, verrocchio, however, although, both, artists, had, a, strong, impact, on, the, young, botticelli, s, development, the, young, artist, s, presence, in, their, workshops, cannot, be, definitively, proven, lippi, died, in, 1469, botticelli, must, have, had, his, own, workshop, by, then, and, in, june, of, that, year, he, was, commissioned, a, panel, of, fortitude, florence, galleria, degli, uffizi, to, accompany, a, set, of, all, seven, virtues, commissioned, one, year, earlier, from, piero, del, pollaiuolo, botticelli, s, panel, adopts, the, format, and, composition, of, piero, s, but, features, a, more, elegant, and, naturally, posed, figure, and, includes, an, array, of, fanciful, enrichments, so, as, to, show, up, piero, s, poverty, of, ornamental, invention, in, 1472, botticelli, took, on, his, first, apprentice, the, young, filippino, lippi, son, of, his, master, botticelli, and, filippino, s, works, from, these, years, including, many, madonna, and, child, paintings, are, often, difficult, to, distinguish, from, one, another, the, two, also, routinely, collaborated, as, in, the, panels, from, a, dismantled, pair, of, cassoni, now, divided, between, the, louvre, the, national, gallery, of, canada, the, mus, e, cond, in, chantilly, and, the, galleria, pallavicini, in, rome, botticelli, s, earliest, surviving, altarpiece, is, a, large, sacra, conversazione, of, about, 1470, 72, now, in, the, uffizi, the, painting, shows, botticelli, s, early, mastery, of, composition, with, eight, figures, arranged, with, an, easy, naturalness, in, a, closed, architectural, setting, another, work, from, this, period, is, the, saint, sebastian, in, berlin, painted, in, 1474, for, a, pier, in, santa, maria, maggiore, florence, this, work, was, painted, soon, after, the, pollaiuolo, brothers, much, larger, altarpiece, of, the, same, saint, london, national, gallery, though, botticelli, s, saint, is, very, similar, in, pose, to, that, by, the, pollaiuolo, he, is, also, calmer, and, more, poised, the, almost, nude, body, is, very, carefully, drawn, and, anatomically, precise, reflecting, the, young, artist, s, close, study, of, the, human, body, the, delicate, winter, landscape, referring, to, the, saint, s, feast, day, in, january, is, inspired, by, contemporary, early, netherlandish, painting, widely, appreciated, in, florentine, circles, at, the, start, of, 1474, botticelli, was, asked, by, the, authorities, in, pisa, to, join, the, work, frescoing, the, camposanto, a, large, prestigious, project, mostly, being, done, by, benozzo, gozzoli, who, spent, nearly, twenty, years, on, it, various, payments, up, to, september, are, recorded, but, no, work, survives, and, it, seems, that, whatever, botticelli, started, was, not, finished, nevertheless, that, botticelli, was, approached, from, outside, florence, demonstrates, a, growing, reputation, the, adoration, of, the, magi, for, santa, maria, novella, c, 1475, 76, now, in, the, uffizi, and, the, first, of, 8, adorations, was, singled, out, for, praise, by, vasari, and, was, in, a, much, visited, church, so, spreading, his, reputation, it, can, be, thought, of, as, marking, the, climax, of, botticelli, s, early, style, despite, being, commissioned, by, a, money, changer, or, perhaps, money, lender, not, otherwise, known, as, an, ally, of, the, medici, it, contains, the, portraits, of, cosimo, de, medici, his, sons, piero, and, giovanni, all, these, by, now, dead, and, his, grandsons, lorenzo, and, giuliano, there, are, also, portraits, of, the, donor, and, in, the, view, of, most, botticelli, himself, standing, at, the, front, on, the, right, the, painting, was, celebrated, for, the, variety, of, the, angles, from, which, the, faces, are, painted, and, of, their, expressions, a, large, fresco, for, the, customs, house, of, florence, that, is, now, lost, depicted, the, execution, by, hanging, of, the, leaders, of, the, pazzi, conspiracy, of, 1478, against, the, medici, it, was, a, florentine, custom, to, humiliate, traitors, in, this, way, by, the, so, called, pittura, infamante, this, was, botticelli, s, first, major, fresco, commission, apart, from, the, abortive, pisa, excursion, and, may, have, led, to, his, summons, to, rome, the, figure, of, francesco, salviati, archbishop, of, pisa, was, removed, in, 1479, after, protests, from, the, pope, and, the, rest, were, destroyed, after, the, expulsion, of, the, medici, and, return, of, the, pazzi, family, in, 1494, another, lost, work, was, a, tondo, of, the, madonna, ordered, by, a, florentine, banker, in, rome, to, present, to, cardinal, francesco, gonzaga, this, perhaps, spread, awareness, of, his, work, to, rome, a, fresco, in, the, palazzo, vecchio, headquarters, of, the, florentine, state, was, lost, in, the, next, century, when, vasari, remodelled, the, building, in, 1480, the, vespucci, family, commissioned, a, fresco, figure, of, saint, augustine, for, the, ognissanti, their, parish, church, and, botticelli, s, someone, else, probably, the, order, running, the, church, commissioned, domenico, ghirlandaio, to, do, a, facing, saint, jerome, both, saints, were, shown, writing, in, their, studies, which, are, crowded, with, objects, as, in, other, cases, such, direct, competition, was, always, an, inducement, to, botticelli, to, put, out, all, his, powers, and, the, fresco, now, his, earliest, to, survive, is, regarded, as, his, finest, by, ronald, lightbown, the, open, book, above, the, saint, contains, one, of, the, practical, jokes, for, which, vasari, says, he, was, known, most, of, the, text, is, scribbles, but, one, line, reads, where, is, brother, martino, he, went, out, and, where, did, he, go, he, is, outside, porta, al, prato, probably, dialogue, overheard, from, the, umiliati, the, order, who, ran, the, church, lightbown, suggests, that, this, shows, botticelli, thought, the, example, of, jerome, and, augustine, likely, to, be, thrown, away, on, the, umiliati, as, he, knew, them, in, 1481, pope, sixtus, iv, summoned, botticelli, and, other, prominent, florentine, and, umbrian, artists, to, fresco, the, walls, of, the, newly, completed, sistine, chapel, this, large, project, was, to, be, the, main, decoration, of, the, chapel, most, of, the, frescos, remain, but, are, greatly, overshadowed, and, disrupted, by, michelangelo, s, work, of, the, next, century, as, some, of, the, earlier, frescos, were, destroyed, to, make, room, for, his, paintings, the, florentine, contribution, is, thought, to, be, part, of, a, peace, deal, between, lorenzo, medici, and, the, papacy, after, sixtus, was, implicated, in, the, pazzi, conspiracy, hostilities, had, escalated, into, excommunication, for, lorenzo, and, other, florentine, officials, and, a, small, pazzi, war, the, iconographic, scheme, was, a, pair, of, cycles, facing, each, other, on, the, sides, of, the, chapel, of, the, life, of, christ, and, the, life, of, moses, together, suggesting, the, supremacy, of, the, papacy, botticelli, s, contribution, included, three, of, the, original, fourteen, large, scenes, the, temptations, of, christ, youth, of, moses, and, punishment, of, the, sons, of, corah, or, various, other, titles, as, well, as, several, of, the, imagined, portraits, of, popes, in, the, level, above, and, paintings, of, unknown, subjects, in, the, lunettes, above, where, michelangelo, s, sistine, chapel, ceiling, now, is, he, may, have, also, done, a, fourth, scene, on, the, end, wall, opposite, the, altar, now, destroyed, each, painter, brought, a, team, of, assistants, from, his, workshop, as, the, space, to, be, covered, was, considerable, each, of, the, main, panels, is, some, 3, 5, by, 5, 7, metres, and, the, work, was, done, in, a, few, months, vasari, implies, that, botticelli, was, given, overall, artistic, charge, of, the, project, but, modern, art, historians, think, it, more, likely, that, pietro, perugino, the, first, artist, to, be, employed, was, given, this, role, if, anyone, was, the, subjects, and, many, details, to, be, stressed, in, their, execution, were, no, doubt, handed, to, the, artists, by, the, vatican, authorities, the, schemes, present, a, complex, and, coherent, programme, asserting, papal, supremacy, and, are, more, unified, in, this, than, in, their, artistic, style, although, the, artists, follow, a, consistent, scale, and, broad, compositional, layout, with, crowds, of, figures, in, the, foreground, and, mainly, landscape, in, the, top, half, of, the, scene, allowing, for, the, painted, pilasters, that, separate, each, scene, the, level, of, the, horizon, matches, between, scenes, and, moses, wears, the, same, yellow, and, green, clothes, in, his, scenes, botticelli, differs, from, his, colleagues, in, imposing, a, more, insistent, triptych, like, composition, dividing, each, of, his, scenes, into, a, main, central, group, with, two, flanking, groups, at, the, sides, showing, different, incidents, in, each, the, principal, figure, of, christ, or, moses, appears, several, times, seven, in, the, case, of, the, youth, of, moses, the, thirty, invented, portraits, of, the, earliest, popes, seem, to, have, been, mainly, botticelli, s, responsibility, at, least, as, far, as, producing, the, cartoons, went, of, those, surviving, most, scholars, agree, that, ten, were, designed, by, botticelli, and, five, probably, at, least, partly, by, him, although, all, have, been, damaged, and, restored, the, punishment, of, the, sons, of, corah, contains, what, was, for, botticelli, an, unusually, close, if, not, exact, copy, of, a, classical, work, this, is, the, rendering, in, the, centre, of, the, north, side, of, the, arch, of, constantine, in, rome, which, he, repeated, in, about, 1500, in, the, story, of, lucretia, if, he, was, apparently, not, spending, his, spare, time, in, rome, drawing, antiquities, as, many, artists, of, his, day, were, very, keen, to, do, he, does, seem, to, have, painted, there, an, adoration, of, the, magi, now, in, the, national, gallery, of, art, in, washington, in, 1482, he, returned, to, florence, and, apart, from, his, lost, frescos, for, the, medici, villa, at, spedaletto, a, year, or, so, later, no, further, trips, away, from, home, are, recorded, he, had, perhaps, been, away, from, july, 1481, to, at, the, latest, may, 1482, the, masterpieces, primavera, c, 1482, and, the, birth, of, venus, c, 1485, are, not, a, pair, but, are, inevitably, discussed, together, both, are, in, the, uffizi, they, are, among, the, most, famous, paintings, in, the, world, and, icons, of, the, italian, renaissance, as, depictions, of, subjects, from, classical, mythology, on, a, very, large, scale, they, were, virtually, unprecedented, in, western, art, since, classical, antiquity, together, with, the, smaller, and, less, celebrated, venus, and, mars, and, pallas, and, the, centaur, they, have, been, endlessly, analysed, by, art, historians, with, the, main, themes, being, the, emulation, of, ancient, painters, and, the, context, of, wedding, celebrations, the, influence, of, renaissance, neo, platonism, and, the, identity, of, the, commissioners, and, possible, models, for, the, figures, though, all, carry, differing, degrees, of, complexity, in, their, meanings, they, also, have, an, immediate, visual, appeal, that, accounts, for, their, enormous, popularity, all, show, dominant, and, beautiful, female, figures, in, an, idyllic, world, of, feeling, with, a, sexual, element, continuing, scholarly, attention, mainly, focuses, on, the, poetry, and, philosophy, of, contemporary, renaissance, humanists, the, works, do, not, illustrate, particular, texts, rather, each, relies, upon, several, texts, for, its, significance, their, beauty, was, characterized, by, vasari, as, exemplifying, grace, and, by, john, ruskin, as, possessing, linear, rhythm, the, pictures, feature, botticelli, s, linear, style, at, its, most, effective, emphasized, by, the, soft, continual, contours, and, pastel, colours, the, primavera, and, the, birth, were, both, seen, by, vasari, in, the, mid, 16th, century, at, the, villa, di, castello, owned, from, 1477, by, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, de, medici, and, until, the, publication, in, 1975, of, a, medici, inventory, of, 1499, it, was, assumed, that, both, works, were, painted, specifically, for, the, villa, recent, scholarship, suggests, otherwise, the, primavera, was, painted, for, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, s, townhouse, in, florence, and, the, birth, of, venus, was, commissioned, by, someone, else, for, a, different, site, botticelli, painted, only, a, small, number, of, mythological, subjects, but, these, are, now, probably, his, best, known, works, a, much, smaller, panel, than, those, discussed, before, is, his, venus, and, mars, in, the, national, gallery, london, this, was, of, a, size, and, shape, to, suggest, that, it, was, a, spalliera, a, painting, made, to, fitted, into, either, furniture, or, more, likely, in, this, case, wood, panelling, the, wasps, buzzing, around, mars, head, suggest, that, it, may, have, been, painted, for, a, member, of, his, neighbours, the, vespucci, family, whose, name, means, little, wasps, in, italian, and, who, featured, wasps, in, their, coat, of, arms, mars, lies, asleep, presumably, after, lovemaking, while, venus, watches, as, infant, satyrs, play, with, his, military, gear, and, one, tries, to, rouse, him, by, blowing, a, conch, shell, in, his, ear, the, painting, was, no, doubt, given, to, celebrate, a, marriage, and, decorate, the, bedchamber, three, of, these, four, large, mythologies, feature, venus, a, central, figure, in, renaissance, neoplatonism, which, gave, divine, love, as, important, a, place, in, its, philosophy, as, did, christianity, the, fourth, pallas, and, the, centaur, is, clearly, connected, with, the, medici, by, the, symbol, on, pallas, dress, the, two, figures, are, roughly, life, size, and, a, number, of, specific, personal, political, or, philosophic, interpretations, have, been, proposed, to, expand, on, the, basic, meaning, of, the, submission, of, passion, to, reason, a, series, of, panels, in, the, form, of, an, spalliera, or, cassone, were, commissioned, from, botticelli, by, antonio, pucci, in, 1483, on, the, occasion, of, the, marriage, of, his, son, giannozzo, with, lucrezia, bini, the, subject, was, the, story, of, nastagio, degli, onesti, from, the, eighth, novel, of, the, fifth, day, of, boccaccio, s, decameron, in, four, panels, the, coats, of, arms, of, the, medici, and, the, bride, and, groom, s, families, appear, in, the, third, panel, botticelli, returned, from, rome, in, 1482, with, a, reputation, considerably, enhanced, by, his, work, there, as, with, his, secular, paintings, many, religious, commissions, are, larger, and, no, doubt, more, expensive, than, before, altogether, more, datable, works, by, botticelli, come, from, the, 1480s, than, any, other, decade, and, most, of, these, are, religious, by, the, mid, 1480s, many, leading, florentine, artists, had, left, the, city, some, never, to, return, the, rising, star, leonardo, da, vinci, who, scoffed, at, botticelli, s, landscapes, left, in, 1481, for, milan, the, pollaiolo, brothers, in, 1484, for, rome, and, andrea, verrochio, in, 1485, for, venice, the, remaining, leaders, of, florentine, painting, botticelli, domenico, ghirlandaio, and, filippino, lippi, worked, on, a, major, fresco, cycle, with, perugino, for, lorenzo, the, magnificent, s, villa, at, spedalletto, near, volterra, botticelli, painted, many, madonnas, covered, in, a, section, below, and, altarpieces, and, frescos, in, florentine, churches, in, 1491, he, served, on, a, committee, to, decide, upon, a, fa, ade, for, the, cathedral, of, florence, receiving, the, next, year, three, payments, for, a, design, for, a, scheme, eventually, abortive, to, put, mosaics, on, some, interior, roof, vaults, in, the, cathedral, the, first, major, church, commission, after, rome, was, the, bardi, altarpiece, finished, and, framed, by, february, 1485, and, now, in, berlin, the, frame, was, by, no, less, a, figure, than, giuliano, da, sangallo, who, was, just, becoming, lorenzo, il, magnifico, s, favourite, architect, an, enthroned, madonna, and, rather, large, child, sit, on, an, elaborately, carved, raised, stone, bench, in, a, garden, with, plants, and, flowers, behind, them, closing, off, all, but, small, patches, of, sky, to, give, a, version, of, the, hortus, conclusus, or, closed, garden, a, very, traditional, setting, for, the, virgin, mary, saints, john, the, baptist, and, an, unusually, elderly, john, the, evangelist, stand, in, the, foreground, small, and, inconspicuous, banderoles, or, ribbons, carrying, biblical, verses, elucidate, the, rather, complex, theological, meaning, of, the, work, for, which, botticelli, must, have, had, a, clerical, advisor, but, do, not, intrude, on, a, simpler, appreciation, of, the, painting, and, its, lovingly, detailed, rendering, which, vasari, praised, it, is, somewhat, typical, of, botticelli, s, relaxed, approach, to, strict, perspective, that, the, top, ledge, of, the, bench, is, seen, from, above, but, the, vases, with, lilies, on, it, from, below, the, donor, from, the, leading, bardi, family, had, returned, to, florence, from, over, twenty, years, as, a, banker, and, wool, merchant, in, london, where, he, was, known, as, john, de, barde, and, aspects, of, the, painting, may, reflect, north, european, and, even, english, art, and, popular, devotional, trends, there, may, have, been, other, panels, in, the, altarpiece, which, are, now, missing, a, larger, and, more, crowded, altarpiece, is, the, san, barnaba, altarpiece, of, about, 1487, now, in, the, uffizi, where, elements, of, botticelli, s, emotional, late, style, begin, to, appear, here, the, setting, is, a, palatial, heavenly, interior, in, the, latest, style, showing, botticelli, taking, a, new, degree, of, interest, in, architecture, possibly, influenced, by, sangallo, the, virgin, and, child, are, raised, high, on, a, throne, at, the, same, level, as, four, angels, carrying, the, instruments, of, the, passion, six, saints, stand, in, line, below, the, throne, several, figures, have, rather, large, heads, and, the, infant, jesus, is, again, very, large, while, the, faces, of, the, virgin, child, and, angels, have, the, linear, beauty, of, his, tondos, the, saints, are, given, varied, and, intense, expressions, four, small, and, rather, simple, predella, panels, survive, there, were, probably, originally, seven, with, the, phase, of, painting, large, secular, works, probably, over, by, the, late, 1480s, botticelli, painted, several, altarpieces, and, this, appears, to, have, been, a, peak, period, for, his, workshop, s, production, of, madonnas, botticelli, s, largest, altarpiece, the, san, marco, altarpiece, 378, x, 258, cm, uffizi, is, the, only, one, to, remain, with, its, full, predella, of, five, panels, in, the, air, above, four, saints, the, coronation, of, the, virgin, is, taking, place, in, a, heavenly, zone, of, gold, and, bright, colours, that, recall, his, earlier, works, with, encircling, angels, dancing, and, throwing, flowers, in, contrast, the, cestello, annunciation, 1489, 90, uffizi, forms, a, natural, grouping, with, other, late, paintings, especially, two, of, the, lamentation, of, christ, that, share, its, sombre, background, colouring, and, the, rather, exaggerated, expressiveness, of, the, bending, poses, of, the, figures, it, does, have, an, unusually, detailed, landscape, still, in, dark, colours, seen, through, the, window, which, seems, to, draw, on, north, european, models, perhaps, from, prints, of, the, two, lamentations, one, is, in, an, unusual, vertical, format, because, like, his, 1474, saint, sebastian, it, was, painted, for, the, side, of, a, pillar, in, the, church, of, santa, maria, maggiore, florence, it, is, now, in, milan, the, other, horizontal, one, was, painted, for, a, chapel, on, the, corner, of, botticelli, s, street, it, is, now, in, munich, in, both, the, crowded, intertwined, figures, around, the, dead, christ, take, up, nearly, all, the, picture, space, with, only, bare, rock, behind, the, virgin, has, swooned, and, the, other, figures, form, a, scrum, to, support, her, and, christ, the, munich, painting, has, three, less, involved, saints, with, attributes, somewhat, oddly, including, saint, peter, usually, regarded, as, in, jerusalem, on, the, day, but, not, present, at, this, scene, and, gives, the, figures, except, christ, flat, halos, shown, in, perspective, which, from, now, on, botticelli, often, uses, both, probably, date, from, 1490, to, 1495, early, records, mentioned, without, describing, it, an, altarpiece, by, botticelli, for, the, convertite, an, institution, for, ex, prostitutes, and, various, surviving, unprovenanced, works, were, proposed, as, candidates, it, is, now, generally, accepted, that, a, painting, in, the, courtauld, gallery, in, london, is, the, pala, delle, convertite, dating, to, about, 1491, 93, its, subject, unusual, for, an, altarpiece, is, the, holy, trinity, with, christ, on, the, cross, supported, from, behind, by, god, the, father, angels, surround, the, trinity, which, is, flanked, by, two, saints, with, tobias, and, the, angel, on, a, far, smaller, scale, right, in, the, foreground, this, was, probably, a, votive, addition, perhaps, requested, by, the, original, donor, the, four, predella, scenes, showing, the, life, of, mary, magdalen, then, taken, as, a, reformed, prostitute, herself, are, in, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, after, about, 1493, or, 1495, botticelli, seems, to, have, painted, no, more, large, religious, paintings, though, production, of, madonnas, probably, continued, the, smaller, narrative, religious, scenes, of, the, last, years, are, covered, below, paintings, of, the, madonna, and, child, that, is, the, virgin, mary, and, infant, jesus, were, enormously, popular, in, 15th, century, italy, in, a, range, of, sizes, and, formats, from, large, altarpieces, of, the, sacra, conversazione, type, to, small, paintings, for, the, home, they, also, often, hung, in, offices, public, buildings, shops, and, clerical, institutions, these, smaller, paintings, were, a, steady, source, of, income, for, painters, at, all, levels, of, quality, and, many, were, probably, produced, for, stock, without, a, specific, commission, botticelli, painted, madonnas, from, the, start, of, his, career, until, at, least, the, 1490s, he, was, one, of, the, first, painters, to, use, the, round, tondo, format, with, the, painted, area, typically, some, 115, to, 145, cm, across, about, four, to, five, feet, this, format, was, more, associated, with, paintings, for, palaces, than, churches, though, they, were, large, enough, to, be, hung, in, churches, and, some, were, later, donated, to, them, several, madonnas, use, this, format, usually, with, a, seated, virgin, shown, down, to, the, knees, and, though, rectangular, pictures, of, the, madonna, outnumber, them, madonnas, in, tondo, form, are, especially, associated, with, botticelli, he, used, the, tondo, format, for, other, subjects, such, as, an, early, adoration, of, the, magi, in, london, and, was, apparently, more, likely, to, paint, a, tondo, madonna, himself, usually, leaving, rectangular, ones, to, his, workshop, botticelli, s, virgins, are, always, beautiful, in, the, same, idealized, way, as, his, mythological, figures, and, often, richly, dressed, in, contemporary, style, although, savonarola, s, main, strictures, were, against, secular, art, he, also, complained, of, the, paintings, in, florentine, churches, that, you, have, made, the, virgin, appear, dressed, as, a, whore, which, may, have, had, an, effect, on, botticelli, s, style, they, are, often, accompanied, by, equally, beautiful, angels, or, an, infant, saint, john, the, baptist, the, patron, saint, of, florence, some, feature, flowers, and, none, the, detailed, landscape, backgrounds, that, other, artists, were, developing, many, exist, in, several, versions, of, varying, quality, often, with, the, elements, other, than, the, virgin, and, child, different, many, of, these, were, produced, by, botticelli, or, especially, his, workshop, and, others, apparently, by, unconnected, artists, when, interest, in, botticelli, revived, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, initially, largely, in, his, madonnas, which, then, began, to, be, forged, on, a, considerable, scale, in, the, magnificat, madonna, in, the, uffizi, 118, cm, or, 46, 5, inches, across, c, 1483, mary, is, writing, down, the, magnificat, a, speech, from, the, gospel, of, luke, 1, 46, 55, where, it, is, spoken, by, mary, upon, the, occasion, of, her, visitation, to, her, cousin, elizabeth, some, months, before, the, birth, of, jesus, she, holds, the, baby, jesus, and, is, surrounded, by, wingless, angels, impossible, to, distinguish, from, fashionably, dressed, florentine, youths, botticelli, s, madonna, and, child, with, angels, carrying, candlesticks, 1485, 1490, was, destroyed, during, world, war, ii, it, was, stored, in, the, friedrichshain, flak, tower, in, berlin, for, safe, keeping, but, in, may, 1945, the, tower, was, set, on, fire, and, most, of, the, objects, inside, were, destroyed, also, lost, were, botticelli, s, madonna, and, child, with, infant, saint, john, and, an, annunciation, botticelli, painted, a, number, of, portraits, although, not, nearly, as, many, as, have, been, attributed, to, him, there, are, a, number, of, idealized, portrait, like, paintings, of, women, which, probably, do, not, represent, a, specific, person, several, closely, resemble, the, venus, in, his, venus, and, mars, traditional, gossip, links, these, to, the, famous, beauty, simonetta, vespucci, who, died, aged, twenty, two, in, 1476, but, this, seems, unlikely, these, figures, represent, a, secular, link, to, his, madonnas, with, one, or, two, exceptions, his, small, independent, panel, portraits, show, the, sitter, no, further, down, the, torso, than, about, the, bottom, of, the, rib, cage, women, are, normally, in, profile, full, or, just, a, little, turned, whereas, men, are, normally, a, three, quarters, pose, but, never, quite, seen, completely, frontally, even, when, the, head, is, facing, more, or, less, straight, ahead, the, lighting, is, used, to, create, a, difference, between, the, sides, of, the, face, backgrounds, may, be, plain, or, show, an, open, window, usually, with, nothing, but, sky, visible, through, it, a, few, have, developed, landscape, backgrounds, these, characteristics, were, typical, of, florentine, portraits, at, the, beginning, of, his, career, but, old, fashioned, by, his, last, years, many, portraits, exist, in, several, versions, probably, most, mainly, by, the, workshop, there, is, often, uncertainty, in, their, attribution, often, the, background, changes, between, versions, while, the, figure, remains, the, same, his, male, portraits, have, also, often, held, dubious, identifications, most, often, of, various, medicis, for, longer, than, the, real, evidence, supports, lightbown, attributes, him, only, with, about, eight, portraits, of, individuals, all, but, three, from, before, about, 1475, botticelli, often, slightly, exaggerates, aspects, of, the, features, to, increase, the, likeness, he, also, painted, portraits, in, other, works, as, when, he, inserted, a, self, portrait, and, the, medici, into, his, early, adoration, of, the, magi, several, figures, in, the, sistine, chapel, frescos, appear, to, be, portraits, but, the, subjects, are, unknown, although, fanciful, guesses, have, been, made, large, allegorical, frescos, from, a, villa, show, members, of, the, tornabuoni, family, together, with, gods, and, personifications, probably, not, all, of, these, survive, but, ones, with, portraits, of, a, young, man, with, the, seven, liberal, arts, and, a, young, woman, with, venus, and, the, three, graces, are, now, in, the, louvre, botticelli, had, a, lifelong, interest, in, the, great, florentine, poet, dante, alighieri, which, produced, works, in, several, media, he, is, attributed, with, an, imagined, portrait, according, to, vasari, he, wrote, a, commentary, on, a, portion, of, dante, which, is, also, referred, to, dismissively, in, another, story, in, the, life, but, no, such, text, has, survived, botticelli, s, attempt, to, design, the, illustrations, for, a, printed, book, was, unprecedented, for, a, leading, painter, and, though, it, seems, to, have, been, something, of, a, flop, this, was, a, role, for, artists, that, had, an, important, future, vasari, wrote, disapprovingly, of, the, first, printed, dante, in, 1481, with, engravings, by, the, goldsmith, baccio, baldini, engraved, from, drawings, by, botticelli, being, of, a, sophistical, turn, of, mind, he, there, wrote, a, commentary, on, a, portion, of, dante, and, illustrated, the, inferno, which, he, printed, spending, much, time, over, it, and, this, abstention, from, work, led, to, serious, disorders, in, his, living, vasari, who, lived, when, printmaking, had, become, far, more, important, than, in, botticelli, s, day, never, takes, it, seriously, perhaps, because, his, own, paintings, did, not, sell, well, in, reproduction, the, divine, comedy, consists, of, 100, cantos, and, the, printed, text, left, space, for, one, engraving, for, each, canto, however, only, 19, illustrations, were, engraved, and, most, copies, of, the, book, have, only, the, first, two, or, three, the, first, two, and, sometimes, three, are, usually, printed, on, the, book, page, while, the, later, ones, are, printed, on, separate, sheets, that, are, pasted, into, place, this, suggests, that, the, production, of, the, engravings, lagged, behind, the, printing, and, the, later, illustrations, were, pasted, into, the, stock, of, printed, and, bound, books, and, perhaps, sold, to, those, who, had, already, bought, the, book, unfortunately, baldini, was, neither, very, experienced, nor, talented, as, an, engraver, and, was, unable, to, express, the, delicacy, of, botticelli, s, style, in, his, plates, two, religious, engravings, are, also, generally, accepted, to, be, after, designs, by, botticelli, botticelli, later, began, a, luxury, manuscript, illustrated, dante, on, parchment, most, of, which, was, taken, only, as, far, as, the, underdrawings, and, only, a, few, pages, are, fully, illuminated, this, manuscript, has, 93, surviving, pages, 32, x, 47, cm, now, divided, between, the, vatican, library, 8, sheets, and, berlin, 83, and, represents, the, bulk, of, botticelli, s, surviving, drawings, once, again, the, project, was, never, completed, even, at, the, drawing, stage, but, some, of, the, early, cantos, appear, to, have, been, at, least, drawn, but, are, now, missing, the, pages, that, survive, have, always, been, greatly, admired, and, much, discussed, as, the, project, raises, many, questions, the, general, consensus, is, that, most, of, the, drawings, are, late, the, main, scribe, can, be, identified, as, niccol, mangona, who, worked, in, florence, between, 1482, and, 1503, whose, work, presumably, preceded, that, of, dante, botticelli, then, appears, to, have, worked, on, the, drawings, over, a, long, period, as, stylistic, development, can, be, seen, and, matched, to, his, paintings, although, other, patrons, have, been, proposed, inevitably, including, medicis, in, particular, the, younger, lorenzo, or, il, magnifico, some, scholars, think, that, botticelli, made, the, manuscript, for, himself, there, are, hints, that, botticelli, may, have, worked, on, illustrations, for, printed, pamphlets, by, savonarola, almost, all, destroyed, after, his, fall, botticelli, became, associated, by, historians, with, the, florentine, school, under, the, patronage, of, lorenzo, de, medici, a, movement, historians, would, later, characterize, as, a, golden, age, the, medici, family, were, effective, rulers, of, florence, which, was, nominally, a, republic, throughout, botticelli, s, lifetime, up, to, 1494, when, the, main, branch, were, expelled, lorenzo, il, magnifico, became, the, head, of, the, family, in, 1469, just, around, the, time, botticelli, started, his, own, workshop, he, was, a, great, patron, of, both, the, visual, and, literary, arts, and, encouraged, and, financed, the, humanist, and, neoplatonist, circle, from, which, much, of, the, character, of, botticelli, s, mythological, painting, seems, to, come, in, general, lorenzo, does, not, seem, to, have, commissioned, much, from, botticelli, preferring, pollaiuolo, and, others, although, views, on, this, differ, a, botticello, who, was, probably, sandro, s, brother, giovanni, was, close, to, lorenzo, although, the, patrons, of, many, works, not, for, churches, remain, unclear, botticelli, seems, to, have, been, used, more, by, lorenzo, il, magnifico, s, two, young, cousins, his, younger, brother, giuliano, and, other, families, allied, to, the, medici, tommaso, soderini, a, close, ally, of, lorenzo, obtained, the, commission, for, the, figure, of, fortitude, of, 1470, which, is, botticelli, s, earliest, securely, dated, painting, completing, a, series, of, the, seven, virtues, left, unfinished, by, piero, del, pollaiuolo, possibly, they, had, been, introduced, by, a, vespucci, who, had, tutored, soderini, s, son, antonio, pucci, another, medici, ally, probably, commissioned, the, london, adoration, of, the, magi, also, around, 1470, giuliano, de, medici, was, assassinated, in, the, pazzi, conspiracy, of, 1478, lorenzo, narrowly, escaped, saved, by, his, bank, manager, and, a, portrait, said, to, be, giuliano, which, survives, in, several, versions, may, be, posthumous, or, with, at, least, one, version, from, not, long, before, his, death, he, is, also, a, focus, for, theories, that, figures, in, the, mythological, paintings, represent, specific, individuals, from, florentine, high, society, usually, paired, with, simonetta, vespucci, who, john, ruskin, persuaded, himself, had, posed, nude, for, botticelli, according, to, vasari, botticelli, became, a, follower, of, the, deeply, moralistic, dominican, friar, girolamo, savonarola, who, preached, in, florence, from, 1490, until, his, execution, in, 1498, botticelli, was, a, follower, of, savonarola, s, and, this, was, why, he, gave, up, painting, and, then, fell, into, considerable, distress, as, he, had, no, other, source, of, income, none, the, less, he, remained, an, obstinate, member, of, the, sect, becoming, one, of, the, piagnoni, the, snivellers, as, they, were, called, then, and, abandoning, his, work, so, finally, as, an, old, man, he, found, himself, so, poor, that, if, lorenzo, de, medici, and, then, his, friends, and, had, not, come, to, his, assistance, he, would, have, almost, died, of, hunger, the, extent, of, savonarola, s, influence, on, botticelli, remains, uncertain, his, brother, simone, was, more, clearly, a, follower, the, story, sometimes, seen, that, he, had, destroyed, his, own, paintings, on, secular, subjects, in, the, 1497, bonfire, of, the, vanities, is, not, told, by, vasari, vasari, s, assertion, that, botticelli, produced, nothing, after, coming, under, the, influence, of, savonarola, is, not, accepted, by, modern, art, historians, the, mystical, nativity, botticelli, s, only, painting, to, carry, an, actual, date, if, one, cryptically, expressed, comes, from, late, 1500, eighteen, months, after, savonarola, died, and, the, development, of, his, style, can, be, traced, through, a, number, of, late, works, as, discussed, below, in, late, 1502, some, four, years, after, savonarola, s, death, isabella, d, este, wanted, a, painting, done, in, florence, her, agent, francesco, malatesta, wrote, to, inform, her, that, her, first, choice, perugino, was, away, filippino, lippi, had, a, full, schedule, for, six, months, but, botticelli, was, free, to, start, at, once, and, ready, to, oblige, she, preferred, to, wait, for, perugino, s, return, this, again, casts, serious, doubt, on, vasari, s, assertion, but, equally, he, does, not, seem, to, have, been, in, great, demand, many, datings, of, works, have, a, range, up, to, 1505, though, he, did, live, a, further, five, years, but, botticelli, apparently, produced, little, work, after, 1501, or, perhaps, earlier, and, his, production, had, already, reduced, after, about, 1495, this, may, be, partly, because, of, the, time, he, devoted, to, the, drawings, for, the, manuscript, dante, in, 1504, he, was, a, member, of, the, committee, appointed, to, decide, where, michelangelo, s, david, would, be, placed, botticelli, returned, to, subjects, from, antiquity, in, the, 1490s, with, a, few, smaller, works, on, subjects, from, ancient, history, containing, more, figures, and, showing, different, scenes, from, each, story, including, moments, of, dramatic, action, these, are, the, calumny, of, apelles, c, 1494, 95, a, recreation, of, a, lost, allegory, by, the, ancient, greek, painter, apelles, which, he, may, have, intended, for, his, personal, use, and, the, pair, of, the, story, of, virginia, and, the, story, of, lucretia, which, are, probably, from, around, 1500, the, mystical, nativity, a, relatively, small, and, very, personal, painting, perhaps, for, his, own, use, appears, to, be, dated, to, the, end, of, 1500, it, takes, to, an, extreme, the, abandonment, of, consistent, scale, among, the, figures, that, had, been, a, feature, of, botticelli, s, religious, paintings, for, some, years, with, the, holy, family, much, larger, than, the, other, figures, even, those, well, in, front, of, them, in, the, picture, space, this, may, be, seen, as, a, partial, reversion, to, gothic, conventions, the, iconography, of, the, familiar, subject, of, the, nativity, is, unique, with, features, including, devils, hiding, in, the, rock, below, the, scene, and, must, be, highly, personal, another, painting, known, as, the, mystic, crucifixion, now, fogg, art, museum, at, harvard, university, clearly, relates, to, the, state, and, fate, of, florence, shown, in, the, background, behind, christ, on, the, cross, beside, which, an, angel, whips, a, marzocco, the, heraldic, lion, that, is, a, symbol, of, the, city, this, can, be, connected, more, directly, to, the, convulsions, of, the, expulsion, of, the, medici, savonarola, s, brief, supremacy, and, the, french, invasion, unfortunately, it, is, very, damaged, such, that, it, may, not, be, by, botticelli, while, it, is, certainly, in, his, style, his, later, work, especially, as, seen, in, the, four, panels, with, scenes, from, the, life, of, saint, zenobius, witnessed, a, diminution, of, scale, expressively, distorted, figures, and, a, non, naturalistic, use, of, colour, reminiscent, of, the, work, of, fra, angelico, nearly, a, century, earlier, botticelli, has, been, compared, to, the, venetian, painter, carlo, crivelli, some, ten, years, older, whose, later, work, also, veers, away, from, the, imminent, high, renaissance, style, instead, choosing, to, move, into, a, distinctly, gothic, idiom, other, scholars, have, seen, premonitions, of, mannerism, in, the, simplified, expressionist, depiction, of, emotions, in, his, works, of, the, last, years, ernst, steinmann, d, 1934, detected, in, the, later, madonnas, a, deepening, of, insight, and, expression, in, the, rendering, of, mary, s, physiognomy, which, he, attributed, to, savonarola, s, influence, also, pushing, back, the, dating, of, some, of, these, madonnas, more, recent, scholars, are, reluctant, to, assign, direct, influence, though, there, is, certainly, a, replacement, of, elegance, and, sweetness, with, forceful, austerity, in, the, last, period, botticelli, continued, to, pay, his, dues, to, the, compagnia, di, san, luca, a, confraternity, rather, than, the, artist, s, guild, until, at, least, october, 1505, the, tentative, date, ranges, assigned, to, his, late, paintings, run, no, further, than, this, by, then, he, was, aged, sixty, or, more, in, this, period, definitely, into, old, age, vasari, who, lived, in, florence, from, around, 1527, says, that, botticelli, died, ill, and, decrepit, at, the, age, of, seventy, eight, after, a, period, when, he, was, unable, to, stand, upright, and, moving, around, with, the, help, of, crutches, he, died, in, may, 1510, but, is, now, thought, to, have, been, something, under, seventy, at, the, time, he, was, buried, with, his, family, outside, the, ognissanti, church, in, a, spot, the, church, has, now, built, over, this, had, been, his, parish, church, since, he, was, baptized, there, and, contained, his, saint, augustine, in, his, study, vasari, mentions, that, botticelli, produced, very, fine, drawings, which, were, sought, out, by, artists, after, his, death, apart, from, the, dante, illustrations, only, a, small, number, of, these, survive, none, of, which, can, be, connected, with, surviving, paintings, or, at, least, not, their, final, compositions, although, they, appear, to, be, preparatory, drawings, rather, than, independent, works, some, may, be, connected, with, the, work, in, other, media, that, we, know, botticelli, did, three, vestments, survive, with, embroidered, designs, by, him, and, he, developed, a, new, technique, for, decorating, banners, for, religious, and, secular, processions, apparently, in, some, kind, of, appliqu, technique, called, commesso, in, 1472, the, records, of, the, painter, s, guild, record, that, botticelli, had, only, filippino, lippi, as, an, assistant, though, another, source, records, a, twenty, eight, year, old, who, had, trained, with, neri, di, bicci, by, 1480, there, were, three, none, of, them, subsequently, of, note, other, names, occur, in, the, record, but, only, lippi, became, a, well, known, master, a, considerable, number, of, works, especially, madonnas, are, attributed, to, botticelli, s, workshop, or, the, master, and, his, workshop, generally, meaning, that, botticelli, did, the, underdrawing, while, the, assistants, did, the, rest, or, drawings, by, him, were, copied, by, the, workshop, botticelli, s, linear, style, was, relatively, easy, to, imitate, making, different, contributions, within, one, work, hard, to, identify, though, the, quality, of, the, master, s, drawing, makes, works, entirely, by, others, mostly, identifiable, the, attribution, of, many, works, remains, debated, especially, in, terms, of, distinguishing, the, share, of, work, between, master, and, workshop, lightbown, believed, that, the, division, between, botticelli, s, autograph, works, and, the, paintings, from, his, workshop, and, circle, is, a, fairly, sharp, one, and, that, in, only, one, major, work, on, panel, do, we, find, important, parts, executed, by, assistants, but, others, might, disagree, the, national, gallery, have, an, adoration, of, the, kings, of, about, 1470, which, they, describe, as, begun, by, filippino, lippi, but, finished, by, botticelli, noting, how, unusual, it, was, for, a, master, to, take, over, a, work, begun, by, a, pupil, according, to, vasari, s, perhaps, unreliable, account, botticelli, earned, a, great, deal, of, money, but, wasted, it, all, through, carelessness, and, lack, of, management, he, continued, to, live, in, the, family, house, all, his, life, also, having, his, studio, there, on, his, father, s, death, in, 1482, it, was, inherited, by, his, brother, giovanni, who, had, a, large, family, by, the, end, of, his, life, it, was, owned, by, his, nephews, from, the, 1490s, he, had, a, modest, country, villa, and, farm, at, bellosguardo, now, swallowed, up, by, the, city, which, was, leased, with, his, brother, simone, botticelli, never, married, and, apparently, expressed, a, strong, dislike, of, the, idea, of, marriage, an, anecdote, records, that, his, patron, tommaso, soderini, who, died, in, 1485, suggested, he, marry, to, which, botticelli, replied, that, a, few, days, before, he, had, dreamed, that, he, had, married, woke, up, struck, with, grief, and, for, the, rest, of, the, night, walked, the, streets, to, avoid, the, dream, resuming, if, he, slept, again, the, story, concludes, cryptically, that, soderini, understood, that, he, was, not, fit, ground, for, planting, vines, he, might, have, had, a, close, relationship, with, simonetta, vespucci, 1453, 1476, who, has, been, claimed, especially, by, john, ruskin, to, be, portrayed, in, several, of, his, works, and, to, have, served, as, the, inspiration, for, many, of, the, female, figures, in, the, artist, s, paintings, it, is, possible, that, he, was, at, least, platonically, in, love, with, simonetta, given, his, request, to, have, himself, buried, at, the, foot, of, her, tomb, in, the, ognissanti, the, church, of, the, vespucci, in, florence, although, this, was, also, botticelli, s, church, where, he, had, been, baptized, when, he, died, in, 1510, his, remains, were, placed, as, he, requested, in, 1938, jacques, mesnil, discovered, a, summary, of, a, charge, in, the, florentine, archives, for, november, 16, 1502, which, read, simply, botticelli, keeps, a, boy, an, accusation, of, sodomy, homosexuality, no, prosecution, was, brought, the, painter, would, then, have, been, about, fifty, eight, mesnil, dismissed, it, as, a, customary, slander, by, which, partisans, and, adversaries, of, savonarola, abused, each, other, opinion, remains, divided, on, whether, this, is, evidence, of, homosexuality, or, not, many, have, backed, mesnil, art, historian, scott, nethersole, has, suggested, that, a, quarter, of, florentine, men, were, the, subject, of, similar, accusations, which, seems, to, have, been, a, standard, way, of, getting, at, people, but, others, have, cautioned, against, hasty, dismissal, of, the, charge, mesnil, nevertheless, concluded, woman, was, not, the, only, object, of, his, love, the, renaissance, art, historian, james, saslow, has, noted, that, his, homo, erotic, sensibility, surfaces, mainly, in, religious, works, where, he, imbued, such, nude, young, saints, as, sebastian, with, the, same, androgynous, grace, and, implicit, physicality, as, donatello, s, david, after, his, death, botticelli, s, reputation, was, eclipsed, longer, and, more, thoroughly, than, that, of, any, other, major, european, artist, his, paintings, remained, in, the, churches, and, villas, for, which, they, had, been, created, and, his, frescos, in, the, sistine, chapel, were, upstaged, by, those, of, michelangelo, there, are, a, few, mentions, of, paintings, and, their, location, in, sources, from, the, decades, after, his, death, vasari, s, life, is, relatively, short, and, especially, in, the, first, edition, of, 1550, rather, disapproving, according, to, the, ettlingers, he, is, clearly, ill, at, ease, with, sandro, and, did, not, know, how, to, fit, him, into, his, evolutionary, scheme, of, the, history, of, art, running, from, cimabue, to, michelangelo, nonetheless, this, is, the, main, source, of, information, about, his, life, even, though, vasari, twice, mixes, him, up, with, francesco, botticini, another, florentine, painter, of, the, day, vasari, saw, botticelli, as, a, firm, partisan, of, the, anti, medici, faction, influenced, by, savonarola, while, vasari, himself, relied, heavily, on, the, patronage, of, the, returned, medicis, of, his, own, day, vasari, also, saw, him, as, an, artist, who, had, abandoned, his, talent, in, his, last, years, which, offended, his, high, idea, of, the, artistic, vocation, he, devotes, a, good, part, of, his, text, to, rather, alarming, anecdotes, of, practical, jokes, by, botticelli, vasari, was, born, the, year, after, botticelli, s, death, but, would, have, known, many, florentines, with, memories, of, him, in, 1621, a, picture, buying, agent, of, ferdinando, gonzaga, duke, of, mantua, bought, him, a, painting, said, to, be, a, botticelli, out, of, historical, interest, as, from, the, hand, of, an, artist, by, whom, your, highness, has, nothing, and, who, was, the, master, of, leonardo, da, vinci, that, mistake, is, perhaps, understandable, as, although, leonardo, was, only, some, six, years, younger, than, botticelli, his, style, could, seem, to, a, baroque, judge, to, be, a, generation, more, advanced, the, birth, of, venus, was, displayed, in, the, uffizi, from, 1815, but, is, little, mentioned, in, travellers, accounts, of, the, gallery, over, the, next, two, decades, the, berlin, gallery, bought, the, bardi, altarpiece, in, 1829, but, the, national, gallery, london, only, bought, a, madonna, now, regarded, as, by, his, workshop, in, 1855, the, english, collector, william, young, ottley, bought, botticelli, s, the, mystical, nativity, in, italy, bringing, it, to, london, in, 1799, but, when, he, tried, to, sell, it, in, 1811, no, buyer, could, be, found, after, ottley, s, death, its, next, purchaser, william, fuller, maitland, of, stansted, allowed, it, to, be, exhibited, in, a, major, art, exhibition, held, in, manchester, in, 1857, the, art, treasures, exhibition, where, among, many, other, art, works, it, was, viewed, by, more, than, a, million, people, his, only, large, painting, with, a, mythological, subject, ever, to, be, sold, on, the, open, market, is, the, venus, and, mars, bought, at, christie, s, by, the, national, gallery, for, a, rather, modest, 1, 050, in, 1874, the, rare, 21st, century,

charles, eastlake, were, alerted, to, botticelli, as, well, and, works, by, his, hand, began, to, appear, in, german, collections, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, incorporated, elements, of, his, work, into, their, own, walter, pater, created, a, literary, picture, of, botticelli, who, was, then, taken, up, by, the, aesthetic, movement, the, first, monograph, on, the, artist, was, published, in, 1893, the, same, year, as, aby, warburg, s, seminal, dissertation, on, the, mythologies, then, between, 1900, and, 1920, more, books, were, written, on, botticelli, than, on, any, other, painter, herbert, horne, s, monograph, in, english, from, 1908, is, still, recognised, as, of, exceptional, quality, and, thoroughness, one, of, the, most, stupendous, achievements, in, renaissance, studies,
