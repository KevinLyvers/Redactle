publius, vergilius, maro, classical, latin, traditional, dates, 15, october, 70, bc, 21, september, 19, bc, usually, called, virgil, or, vergil, v, r, d, l, vur, jil, in, english, was, an, ancient, roman, poet, of, the, augustan, period, he, composed, three, of, the, most, famous, poems, in, latin, literature, the, eclogues, or, bucolics, the, georgics, and, the, epic, aeneid, a, number, of, minor, poems, collected, in, the, appendix, vergiliana, were, attributed, to, him, in, ancient, times, but, modern, scholars, consider, his, authorship, of, these, poems, to, be, dubious, virgil, s, work, has, had, great, influence, on, western, literature, most, notably, dante, s, divine, comedy, in, which, virgil, appears, as, the, author, s, guide, through, hell, and, purgatory, virgil, has, been, traditionally, ranked, as, one, of, rome, s, greatest, poets, since, its, composition, his, aeneid, has, been, considered, the, national, epic, of, ancient, rome, virgil, s, biographical, tradition, is, thought, to, depend, on, a, lost, biography, by, the, roman, poet, varius, this, biography, was, incorporated, into, an, account, by, the, historian, suetonius, as, well, as, the, later, commentaries, of, servius, and, donatus, the, two, great, commentators, on, virgil, s, poetry, although, the, commentaries, record, much, factual, information, about, virgil, some, of, their, evidence, can, be, shown, to, rely, on, allegorizing, and, on, inferences, drawn, from, his, poetry, for, this, reason, details, regarding, virgil, s, life, story, are, considered, somewhat, problematic, 1602, according, to, these, accounts, publius, vergilius, maro, was, born, in, the, village, of, andes, near, mantua, in, cisalpine, gaul, northern, italy, added, to, italy, proper, during, his, lifetime, analysis, of, his, name, has, led, some, to, believe, that, he, descended, from, earlier, roman, colonists, modern, speculation, is, not, supported, by, narrative, evidence, from, his, writings, or, his, later, biographers, macrobius, says, that, virgil, s, father, was, of, a, humble, background, though, scholars, generally, believe, that, virgil, was, from, an, equestrian, landowning, family, who, could, afford, to, give, him, an, education, he, attended, schools, in, cremona, mediolanum, rome, and, naples, after, briefly, considering, a, career, in, rhetoric, and, law, the, young, virgil, turned, his, talents, to, poetry, according, to, robert, seymour, conway, the, only, ancient, source, which, reports, the, actual, distance, between, andes, and, mantua, is, a, surviving, fragment, from, the, works, of, marcus, valerius, probus, probus, flourished, during, the, reign, of, nero, ad, 54, 68, probus, reports, that, andes, was, located, 30, roman, miles, from, mantua, conway, translated, this, to, a, distance, of, about, 45, kilometres, or, 28, miles, relatively, little, is, known, about, the, family, of, virgil, his, father, reportedly, belonged, to, gens, vergilia, and, his, mother, belonged, to, gens, magia, according, to, conway, gens, vergilia, is, poorly, attested, in, inscriptions, from, the, entire, northern, italy, where, mantua, is, located, among, thousands, of, surviving, ancient, inscriptions, from, this, region, there, are, only, 8, or, 9, mentions, of, individuals, called, vergilius, masculine, or, vergilia, feminine, out, of, these, mentions, three, appear, in, inscriptions, from, verona, and, one, in, an, inscription, from, calvisano, conway, theorized, that, the, inscription, from, calvisano, had, to, do, with, a, kinswoman, of, virgil, calvisano, is, located, 30, roman, miles, from, mantua, and, would, fit, with, probus, s, description, of, andes, the, inscription, in, this, case, is, a, votive, offering, to, the, matronae, a, group, of, deities, by, a, woman, called, vergilia, asking, the, goddesses, to, deliver, from, danger, another, woman, called, munatia, conway, notes, that, the, offering, belongs, to, a, common, type, for, this, era, where, women, made, requests, for, deities, to, preserve, the, lives, of, female, loved, ones, who, were, pregnant, and, were, about, to, give, birth, in, most, cases, the, woman, making, the, request, was, the, mother, of, a, woman, who, was, pregnant, or, otherwise, in, danger, though, there, is, another, inscription, from, calvisano, where, a, woman, asks, the, deities, to, preserve, the, life, of, her, sister, munatia, the, woman, whom, vergilia, wished, to, protect, was, likely, a, close, relative, of, vergilia, possibly, her, daughter, the, name, munatia, indicates, that, this, woman, was, a, member, of, gens, munatia, and, makes, it, likely, that, vergilia, married, into, this, family, other, studies, claim, that, today, s, consideration, for, ancient, andes, should, be, sought, in, the, casalpoglio, area, of, castel, goffredo, according, to, the, commentators, virgil, received, his, first, education, when, he, was, five, years, old, and, later, went, to, cremona, milan, and, finally, rome, to, study, rhetoric, medicine, and, astronomy, which, he, would, abandon, for, philosophy, from, virgil, s, admiring, references, to, the, neoteric, writers, pollio, and, cinna, it, has, been, inferred, that, he, was, for, a, time, associated, with, catullus, s, neoteric, circle, according, to, servius, schoolmates, considered, virgil, extremely, shy, and, reserved, and, he, was, nicknamed, parthenias, virgin, because, of, his, social, aloofness, virgil, also, seems, to, have, suffered, bad, health, throughout, his, life, and, in, some, ways, lived, the, life, of, an, invalid, according, to, the, catalepton, he, began, to, write, poetry, while, in, the, epicurean, school, of, siro, in, naples, a, group, of, small, works, attributed, to, the, youthful, virgil, by, the, commentators, survive, collected, under, the, title, appendix, vergiliana, but, are, largely, considered, spurious, by, scholars, one, the, catalepton, consists, of, fourteen, short, poems, 1602, some, of, which, may, be, virgil, s, and, another, a, short, narrative, poem, titled, the, culex, the, gnat, was, attributed, to, virgil, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, ad, the, biographical, tradition, asserts, that, virgil, began, the, hexameter, eclogues, or, bucolics, in, 42, bc, and, it, is, thought, that, the, collection, was, published, around, 39, 38, bc, although, this, is, controversial, 1602, the, eclogues, from, the, greek, for, selections, are, a, group, of, ten, poems, roughly, modeled, on, the, bucolic, that, is, pastoral, or, rural, poetry, of, the, hellenistic, poet, theocritus, which, were, written, in, dactylic, hexameter, after, defeating, the, army, led, by, the, assassins, of, julius, caesar, in, the, battle, of, philippi, 42, bc, octavian, tried, to, pay, off, his, veterans, with, land, expropriated, from, towns, in, northern, italy, which, according, to, tradition, included, an, estate, near, mantua, belonging, to, virgil, the, loss, of, virgil, s, family, farm, and, the, attempt, through, poetic, petitions, to, regain, his, property, have, traditionally, been, seen, as, his, motives, in, the, composition, of, the, eclogues, this, is, now, thought, to, be, an, unsupported, inference, from, interpretations, of, the, eclogues, in, eclogues, 1, and, 9, virgil, indeed, dramatizes, the, contrasting, feelings, caused, by, the, brutality, of, the, land, expropriations, through, pastoral, idiom, but, offers, no, indisputable, evidence, of, the, supposed, biographic, incident, while, some, readers, have, identified, the, poet, himself, with, various, characters, and, their, vicissitudes, whether, gratitude, by, an, old, rustic, to, a, new, god, ecl, 1, frustrated, love, by, a, rustic, singer, for, a, distant, boy, his, master, s, pet, ecl, 2, or, a, master, singer, s, claim, to, have, composed, several, eclogues, ecl, 5, modern, scholars, largely, reject, such, efforts, to, garner, biographical, details, from, works, of, fiction, preferring, to, interpret, an, author, s, characters, and, themes, as, illustrations, of, contemporary, life, and, thought, the, ten, eclogues, present, traditional, pastoral, themes, with, a, fresh, perspective, eclogues, 1, and, 9, address, the, land, confiscations, and, their, effects, on, the, italian, countryside, 2, and, 3, are, pastoral, and, erotic, discussing, both, homosexual, love, ecl, 2, and, attraction, toward, people, of, any, gender, ecl, 3, eclogue, 4, addressed, to, asinius, pollio, the, so, called, messianic, eclogue, uses, the, imagery, of, the, golden, age, in, connection, with, the, birth, of, a, child, who, the, child, was, meant, to, be, has, been, subject, to, debate, 5, and, 8, describe, the, myth, of, daphnis, in, a, song, contest, 6, the, cosmic, and, mythological, song, of, silenus, 7, a, heated, poetic, contest, and, 10, the, sufferings, of, the, contemporary, elegiac, poet, cornelius, gallus, virgil, in, his, eclogues, is, credited, with, establishing, arcadia, as, a, poetic, ideal, that, still, resonates, in, western, literature, and, visual, arts, and, with, setting, the, stage, for, the, development, of, latin, pastoral, by, calpurnius, siculus, nemesianus, and, later, writers, sometime, after, the, publication, of, the, eclogues, probably, before, 37, bc, 1603, virgil, became, part, of, the, circle, of, maecenas, octavian, s, capable, agent, d, affaires, who, sought, to, counter, sympathy, for, antony, among, the, leading, families, by, rallying, roman, literary, figures, to, octavian, s, side, virgil, came, to, know, many, of, the, other, leading, literary, figures, of, the, time, including, horace, in, whose, poetry, he, is, often, mentioned, and, varius, rufus, who, later, helped, finish, the, aeneid, at, maecenas, s, insistence, according, to, the, tradition, virgil, spent, the, ensuing, years, perhaps, 37, 29, bc, on, the, long, dactylic, hexameter, poem, called, the, georgics, from, greek, on, working, the, earth, which, he, dedicated, to, maecenas, the, ostensible, theme, of, the, georgics, is, instruction, in, the, methods, of, running, a, farm, in, handling, this, theme, virgil, follows, in, the, didactic, how, to, tradition, of, the, greek, poet, hesiod, s, works, and, days, and, several, works, of, the, later, hellenistic, poets, the, four, books, of, the, georgics, focus, respectively, on, well, known, passages, include, the, beloved, laus, italiae, of, book, 2, the, prologue, description, of, the, temple, in, book, 3, and, the, description, of, the, plague, at, the, end, of, book, 3, book, 4, concludes, with, a, long, mythological, narrative, in, the, form, of, an, epyllion, which, describes, vividly, the, discovery, of, beekeeping, by, aristaeus, and, the, story, of, orpheus, journey, to, the, underworld, ancient, scholars, such, as, servius, conjectured, that, the, aristaeus, episode, replaced, at, the, emperor, s, request, a, long, section, in, praise, of, virgil, s, friend, the, poet, gallus, who, was, disgraced, by, augustus, and, who, committed, suicide, in, 26, bc, the, tone, of, the, georgics, wavers, between, optimism, and, pessimism, sparking, critical, debate, on, the, poet, s, intentions, 1605, but, the, work, lays, the, foundations, for, later, didactic, poetry, virgil, and, maecenas, are, said, to, have, taken, turns, reading, the, georgics, to, octavian, upon, his, return, from, defeating, antony, and, cleopatra, at, the, battle, of, actium, in, 31, bc, the, aeneid, is, widely, considered, virgil, s, finest, work, and, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, poems, in, the, history, of, western, literature, t, s, eliot, referred, to, it, as, the, classic, of, all, europe, the, work, modelled, after, homer, s, iliad, and, odyssey, chronicles, a, refugee, of, the, trojan, war, named, aeneas, as, he, struggles, to, fulfill, his, destiny, his, intentions, are, to, reach, italy, where, his, descendants, romulus, and, remus, are, to, found, the, city, of, rome, virgil, worked, on, the, aeneid, during, the, last, eleven, years, of, his, life, 29, 19, bc, commissioned, according, to, propertius, by, augustus, the, epic, poem, consists, of, 12, books, in, dactylic, hexameter, verse, which, describe, the, journey, of, aeneas, a, warrior, fleeing, the, sack, of, troy, to, italy, his, battle, with, the, italian, prince, turnus, and, the, foundation, of, a, city, from, which, rome, would, emerge, the, aeneid, s, first, six, books, describe, the, journey, of, aeneas, from, troy, to, rome, virgil, made, use, of, several, models, in, the, composition, of, his, epic, 1603, homer, the, pre, eminent, author, of, classical, epic, is, everywhere, present, but, virgil, also, makes, special, use, of, the, latin, poet, ennius, and, the, hellenistic, poet, apollonius, of, rhodes, among, the, various, other, writers, to, whom, he, alludes, although, the, aeneid, casts, itself, firmly, into, the, epic, mode, it, often, seeks, to, expand, the, genre, by, including, elements, of, other, genres, such, as, tragedy, and, aetiological, poetry, ancient, commentators, noted, that, virgil, seems, to, divide, the, aeneid, into, two, sections, based, on, the, poetry, of, homer, the, first, six, books, were, viewed, as, employing, the, odyssey, as, a, model, while, the, last, six, were, connected, to, the, iliad, book, 1, at, the, head, of, the, odyssean, section, opens, with, a, storm, which, juno, aeneas, s, enemy, throughout, the, poem, stirs, up, against, the, fleet, the, storm, drives, the, hero, to, the, coast, of, carthage, which, historically, was, rome, s, deadliest, foe, the, queen, dido, welcomes, the, ancestor, of, the, romans, and, under, the, influence, of, the, gods, falls, deeply, in, love, with, him, at, a, banquet, in, book, 2, aeneas, tells, the, story, of, the, sack, of, troy, the, death, of, his, wife, and, his, escape, to, the, enthralled, carthaginians, while, in, book, 3, he, recounts, to, them, his, wanderings, over, the, mediterranean, in, search, of, a, suitable, new, home, jupiter, in, book, 4, recalls, the, lingering, aeneas, to, his, duty, to, found, a, new, city, and, he, slips, away, from, carthage, leaving, dido, to, commit, suicide, cursing, aeneas, and, calling, down, revenge, in, symbolic, anticipation, of, the, fierce, wars, between, carthage, and, rome, in, book, 5, funeral, games, are, celebrated, for, aeneas, s, father, anchises, who, had, died, a, year, before, on, reaching, cumae, in, italy, in, book, 6, aeneas, consults, the, cumaean, sibyl, who, conducts, him, through, the, underworld, where, aeneas, meets, the, dead, anchises, who, reveals, rome, s, destiny, to, his, son, book, 7, beginning, the, iliadic, half, opens, with, an, address, to, the, muse, and, recounts, aeneas, s, arrival, in, italy, and, betrothal, to, lavinia, daughter, of, king, latinus, lavinia, had, already, been, promised, to, turnus, the, king, of, the, rutulians, who, is, roused, to, war, by, the, fury, allecto, and, amata, lavinia, s, mother, in, book, 8, aeneas, allies, with, king, evander, who, occupies, the, future, site, of, rome, and, is, given, new, armor, and, a, shield, depicting, roman, history, book, 9, records, an, assault, by, nisus, and, euryalus, on, the, rutulians, book, 10, the, death, of, evander, s, young, son, pallas, and, 11, the, death, of, the, volscian, warrior, princess, camilla, and, the, decision, to, settle, the, war, with, a, duel, between, aeneas, and, turnus, the, aeneid, ends, in, book, 12, with, the, taking, of, latinus, s, city, the, death, of, amata, and, aeneas, s, defeat, and, killing, of, turnus, whose, pleas, for, mercy, are, spurned, the, final, book, ends, with, the, image, of, turnus, s, soul, lamenting, as, it, flees, to, the, underworld, critics, of, the, aeneid, focus, on, a, variety, of, issues, the, tone, of, the, poem, as, a, whole, is, a, particular, matter, of, debate, some, see, the, poem, as, ultimately, pessimistic, and, politically, subversive, to, the, augustan, regime, while, others, view, it, as, a, celebration, of, the, new, imperial, dynasty, virgil, makes, use, of, the, symbolism, of, the, augustan, regime, and, some, scholars, see, strong, associations, between, augustus, and, aeneas, the, one, as, founder, and, the, other, as, re, founder, of, rome, a, strong, teleology, or, drive, towards, a, climax, has, been, detected, in, the, poem, the, aeneid, is, full, of, prophecies, about, the, future, of, rome, the, deeds, of, augustus, his, ancestors, and, famous, romans, and, the, carthaginian, wars, the, shield, of, aeneas, even, depicts, augustus, s, victory, at, actium, against, mark, antony, and, cleopatra, vii, in, 31, bc, a, further, focus, of, study, is, the, character, of, aeneas, as, the, protagonist, of, the, poem, aeneas, seems, to, waver, constantly, between, his, emotions, and, commitment, to, his, prophetic, duty, to, found, rome, critics, note, the, breakdown, of, aeneas, s, emotional, control, in, the, last, sections, of, the, poem, where, the, pious, and, righteous, aeneas, mercilessly, slaughters, turnus, the, aeneid, appears, to, have, been, a, great, success, virgil, is, said, to, have, recited, books, 2, 4, and, 6, to, augustus, 1603, and, book, 6, apparently, caused, the, emperor, s, sister, octavia, to, faint, although, the, truth, of, this, claim, is, subject, to, scholarly, skepticism, it, has, served, as, a, basis, for, later, art, such, as, jean, baptiste, wicar, s, virgil, reading, the, aeneid, some, lines, of, the, poem, were, left, unfinished, and, the, whole, was, unedited, at, virgil, s, death, in, 19, bc, according, to, the, tradition, virgil, traveled, to, the, senatorial, province, of, achaea, in, greece, in, about, 19, bc, to, revise, the, aeneid, after, meeting, augustus, in, athens, and, deciding, to, return, home, virgil, caught, a, fever, while, visiting, a, town, near, megara, after, crossing, to, italy, by, ship, weakened, with, disease, virgil, died, in, brundisium, harbor, on, 21, september, 19, bc, augustus, ordered, virgil, s, literary, executors, lucius, varius, rufus, and, plotius, tucca, to, disregard, virgil, s, own, wish, that, the, poem, be, burned, instead, ordering, it, to, be, published, with, as, few, editorial, changes, as, possible, 112, as, a, result, the, text, of, the, aeneid, that, exists, may, contain, faults, which, virgil, was, planning, to, correct, before, publication, however, the, only, obvious, imperfections, are, a, few, lines, of, verse, that, are, metrically, unfinished, i, e, not, a, complete, line, of, dactylic, hexameter, some, scholars, have, argued, that, virgil, deliberately, left, these, metrically, incomplete, lines, for, dramatic, effect, other, alleged, imperfections, are, subject, to, scholarly, debate, the, works, of, virgil, almost, from, the, moment, of, their, publication, revolutionized, latin, poetry, the, eclogues, georgics, and, above, all, the, aeneid, became, standard, texts, in, school, curricula, with, which, all, educated, romans, were, familiar, poets, following, virgil, often, refer, intertextually, to, his, works, to, generate, meaning, in, their, own, poetry, the, augustan, poet, ovid, parodies, the, opening, lines, of, the, aeneid, in, amores, 1, 1, 1, 2, and, his, summary, of, the, aeneas, story, in, book, 14, of, the, metamorphoses, the, so, called, mini, aeneid, has, been, viewed, as, a, particularly, important, example, of, post, virgilian, response, to, the, epic, genre, lucan, s, epic, the, bellum, civile, has, been, considered, an, anti, virgilian, epic, disposing, of, the, divine, mechanism, treating, historical, events, and, diverging, drastically, from, virgilian, epic, practice, the, flavian, era, poet, statius, in, his, 12, book, epic, thebaid, engages, closely, with, the, poetry, of, virgil, in, his, epilogue, he, advises, his, poem, not, to, rival, the, divine, aeneid, but, follow, afar, and, ever, venerate, its, footsteps, virgil, finds, one, of, his, most, ardent, admirers, in, silius, italicus, with, almost, every, line, of, his, epic, punica, silius, references, virgil, silius, is, known, to, have, bought, and, restored, virgil, s, tomb, and, worshipped, the, poet, partially, as, a, result, of, his, so, called, messianic, fourth, eclogue, widely, interpreted, later, to, have, predicted, the, birth, of, jesus, christ, virgil, was, in, later, antiquity, imputed, to, have, the, magical, abilities, of, a, seer, the, sortes, vergilianae, the, process, of, using, virgil, s, poetry, as, a, tool, of, divination, is, found, in, the, time, of, hadrian, and, continued, into, the, middle, ages, in, a, similar, vein, macrobius, in, the, saturnalia, credits, the, work, of, virgil, as, the, embodiment, of, human, knowledge, and, experience, mirroring, the, greek, conception, of, homer, 1603, virgil, also, found, commentators, in, antiquity, servius, a, commentator, of, the, 4th, century, ad, based, his, work, on, the, commentary, of, donatus, servius, s, commentary, provides, us, with, a, great, deal, of, information, about, virgil, s, life, sources, and, references, however, many, modern, scholars, find, the, variable, quality, of, his, work, and, the, often, simplistic, interpretations, frustrating, even, as, the, western, roman, empire, collapsed, literate, men, acknowledged, that, virgil, was, a, master, poet, saint, augustine, for, example, confessing, how, he, had, wept, at, reading, the, death, of, dido, the, best, known, surviving, manuscripts, of, virgil, s, works, include, manuscripts, from, late, antiquity, such, as, the, vergilius, augusteus, the, vergilius, vaticanus, and, the, vergilius, romanus, gregory, of, tours, read, virgil, whom, he, quotes, in, several, places, along, with, some, other, latin, poets, though, he, cautions, that, we, ought, not, to, relate, their, lying, fables, lest, we, fall, under, sentence, of, eternal, death, in, the, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, alexander, neckham, placed, the, divine, aeneid, on, his, standard, arts, curriculum, and, dido, became, the, romantic, heroine, of, the, age, monks, like, maiolus, of, cluny, might, repudiate, what, they, called, the, luxurious, eloquence, of, virgil, but, they, could, not, deny, the, power, of, his, appeal, dante, presents, virgil, as, his, guide, through, hell, and, the, greater, part, of, purgatory, in, the, divine, comedy, dante, also, mentions, virgil, in, de, vulgari, eloquentia, as, one, of, the, four, regulati, poetae, along, with, ovid, lucan, and, statius, ii, vi, 7, the, renaissance, saw, a, number, of, authors, inspired, to, write, epic, in, virgil, s, wake, edmund, spenser, called, himself, the, english, virgil, paradise, lost, was, influenced, by, the, example, of, the, aeneid, and, later, artists, influenced, by, virgil, include, berlioz, and, hermann, broch, the, legend, of, virgil, in, his, basket, arose, in, the, middle, ages, and, is, often, seen, in, art, and, mentioned, in, literature, as, part, of, the, power, of, women, literary, topos, demonstrating, the, disruptive, force, of, female, attractiveness, on, men, in, this, story, virgil, became, enamoured, of, a, beautiful, woman, sometimes, described, as, the, emperor, s, daughter, or, mistress, and, called, lucretia, she, played, him, along, and, agreed, to, an, assignation, at, her, house, which, he, was, to, sneak, into, at, night, by, climbing, into, a, large, basket, let, down, from, a, window, when, he, did, so, he, was, hoisted, only, halfway, up, the, wall, and, then, left, trapped, there, into, the, next, day, exposed, to, public, ridicule, the, story, paralleled, that, of, phyllis, riding, aristotle, among, other, artists, depicting, the, scene, lucas, van, leyden, made, a, woodcut, and, later, an, engraving, in, the, middle, ages, virgil, s, reputation, was, such, that, it, inspired, legends, associating, him, with, magic, and, prophecy, from, at, least, the, 3rd, century, christian, thinkers, interpreted, eclogue, 4, which, describes, the, birth, of, a, boy, ushering, in, a, golden, age, as, a, prediction, of, jesus, s, birth, in, consequence, virgil, came, to, be, seen, on, a,

as, a, great, magician, legends, about, virgil, and, his, magical, powers, remained, popular, for, over, two, hundred, years, arguably, becoming, as, prominent, as, his, writings, themselves, virgil, s, legacy, in, medieval, wales, was, such, that, the, welsh, version, of, his, name, fferyllt, or, pheryllt, became, a, generic, term, for, magic, worker, and, survives, in, the, modern, welsh, word,

anglicisations, vergil, and, virgil, are, both, considered, acceptable, there, is, some, speculation, that, the, spelling, virgilius, might, have, arisen, due, to, a, pun, since, virg, carries, an,
