that, during, all, the, years, until, 1961, not, only, was, i, convinced, i, should, never, see, a, single, line, of, mine, in, print, in, my, lifetime, but, also, i, scarcely, dared, allow, any, of, my, close, acquaintances, to, read, anything, i, had, written, because, i, feared, this, would, become, known, in, 1960, aged, 42, solzhenitsyn, approached, aleksandr, tvardovsky, a, poet, and, the, chief, editor, of, the, novy, mir, magazine, with, the, manuscript, of, one, day, in, the, life, of, ivan, denisovich, it, was, published, in, edited, form, in, 1962, with, the, explicit, approval, of, nikita, khrushchev, who, defended, it, at, the, presidium, of, the, politburo, hearing, on, whether, to, allow, its, publication, and, added, there, s, a, stalinist, in, each, of, you, there, s, even, a, stalinist, in, me, we, must, root, out, this, evil, the, book, quickly, sold, out, and, became, an, instant, hit, in, the, 1960s, while, solzhenitsyn, was, publicly, known, to, be, writing, cancer, ward, he, was, simultaneously, writing, the, gulag, archipelago, during, khrushchev, s, tenure, one, day, in, the, life, of, ivan, denisovich, was, studied, in, schools, in, the, soviet, union, as, were, three, more, short, works, of, solzhenitsyn, s, including, his, short, story, matryona, s, home, published, in, 1963, these, would, be, the, last, of, his, works, published, in, the, soviet, union, until, 1990, one, day, in, the, life, of, ivan, denisovich, brought, the, soviet, system, of, prison, labour, to, the, attention, of, the, west, it, caused, as, much, of, a, sensation, in, the, soviet, union, as, it, did, in, the, west, not, only, by, its, striking, realism, and, candour, but, also, because, it, was, the, first, major, piece, of, soviet, literature, since, the, 1920s, on, a, politically, charged, theme, written, by, a, non, party, member, indeed, a, man, who, had, been, to, siberia, for, libelous, speech, about, the, leaders, and, yet, its, publication, had, been, officially, permitted, in, this, sense, the, publication, of, solzhenitsyn, s, story, was, an, almost, unheard, of, instance, of, free, unrestrained, discussion, of, politics, through, literature, however, after, khrushchev, had, been, ousted, from, power, in, 1964, the, time, for, such, raw, exposing, works, came, to, an, end, every, time, when, we, speak, about, solzhenitsyn, as, the, enemy, of, the, soviet, regime, this, just, happens, to, coincide, with, some, important, events, and, we, postpone, the, decision, andrei, kirilenko, a, politburo, member, solzhenitsyn, made, an, unsuccessful, attempt, with, the, help, of, tvardovsky, to, have, his, novel, cancer, ward, legally, published, in, the, soviet, union, this, required, the, approval, of, the, union, of, writers, though, some, there, appreciated, it, the, work, was, ultimately, denied, publication, unless, it, was, to, be, revised, and, cleaned, of, suspect, statements, and, anti, soviet, insinuations, after, khrushchev, s, removal, in, 1964, the, cultural, climate, again, became, more, repressive, publishing, of, solzhenitsyn, s, work, quickly, stopped, as, a, writer, he, became, a, non, person, and, by, 1965, the, kgb, had, seized, some, of, his, papers, including, the, manuscript, of, in, the, first, circle, meanwhile, solzhenitsyn, continued, to, secretly, and, feverishly, work, on, the, most, well, known, of, his, writings, the, gulag, archipelago, the, seizing, of, his, novel, manuscript, first, made, him, desperate, and, frightened, but, gradually, he, realized, that, it, had, set, him, free, from, the, pretenses, and, trappings, of, being, an, officially, acclaimed, writer, a, status, which, had, become, familiar, but, which, was, becoming, increasingly, irrelevant, after, the, kgb, had, confiscated, solzhenitsyn, s, materials, in, moscow, in, the, years, 1965, to, 1967, the, preparatory, drafts, of, the, gulag, archipelago, were, turned, into, finished, typescript, in, hiding, at, his, friends, homes, in, soviet, estonia, solzhenitsyn, had, befriended, arnold, susi, a, lawyer, and, former, minister, of, education, of, estonia, in, a, lubyanka, building, prison, cell, after, completion, solzhenitsyn, s, original, handwritten, script, was, kept, hidden, from, the, kgb, in, estonia, by, arnold, susi, s, daughter, heli, susi, until, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1969, solzhenitsyn, was, expelled, from, the, union, of, writers, in, 1970, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, he, could, not, receive, the, prize, personally, in, stockholm, at, that, time, since, he, was, afraid, he, would, not, be, let, back, into, the, soviet, union, instead, it, was, suggested, he, should, receive, the, prize, in, a, special, ceremony, at, the, swedish, embassy, in, moscow, the, swedish, government, refused, to, accept, this, solution, because, such, a, ceremony, and, the, ensuing, media, coverage, might, upset, the, soviet, union, and, damage, swedish, soviet, relations, instead, solzhenitsyn, received, his, prize, at, the, 1974, ceremony, after, he, had, been, expelled, from, the, soviet, union, in, 1973, another, manuscript, written, by, solzhenitsyn, was, confiscated, by, the, kgb, after, his, friend, elizaveta, voronyanskaya, was, questioned, non, stop, for, five, days, until, she, revealed, its, location, according, to, a, statement, by, solzhenitsyn, to, western, reporters, on, september, 6, 1973, according, to, solzhenitsyn, when, she, returned, home, she, hanged, herself, the, gulag, archipelago, was, composed, from, 1958, to, 1967, and, has, sold, over, thirty, million, copies, in, thirty, five, languages, it, was, a, three, volume, seven, part, work, on, the, soviet, prison, camp, system, which, drew, from, solzhenitsyn, s, experiences, and, the, testimony, of, 256, former, prisoners, and, solzhenitsyn, s, own, research, into, the, history, of, the, russian, penal, system, it, discusses, the, system, s, origins, from, the, founding, of, the, communist, regime, with, vladimir, lenin, having, responsibility, detailing, interrogation, procedures, prisoner, transports, prison, camp, culture, prisoner, uprisings, and, revolts, such, as, the, kengir, uprising, and, the, practice, of, internal, exile, soviet, and, communist, studies, historian, and, archival, researcher, stephen, g, wheatcroft, wrote, that, the, book, was, essentially, a, literary, and, political, work, and, never, claimed, to, place, the, camps, in, a, historical, or, social, scientific, quantitative, perspective, but, that, in, the, case, of, qualitative, estimates, solzhenitsyn, gave, his, high, estimate, as, he, wanted, to, challenge, the, soviet, authorities, to, show, that, the, scale, of, the, camps, was, less, than, this, historian, j, arch, getty, wrote, of, solzhenitsyn, s, methodology, that, such, documentation, is, methodically, unacceptable, in, other, fields, of, history, which, gives, priority, to, vague, hearsay, and, leads, towards, selective, bias, according, to, journalist, anne, applebaum, who, has, made, extensive, research, on, the, gulag, the, gulag, archipelago, s, rich, and, varied, authorial, voice, its, unique, weaving, together, of, personal, testimony, philosophical, analysis, and, historical, investigation, and, its, unrelenting, indictment, of, communist, ideology, made,

likely, ricin, with, an, experimental, gel, based, delivery, method, the, attempt, left, him, seriously, ill, but, he, survived, although, the, gulag, archipelago, was, not, published, in, the, soviet, union, it, was, extensively, criticized, by, the, party, controlled, soviet, press, an, editorial, in, pravda, on, 14, january, 1974, accused, solzhenitsyn, of, supporting, hitlerites, and, making, excuses, for, the, crimes, of, the, vlasovites, and, bandera, gangs, according, to, the, editorial, solzhenitsyn, was, choking, with, pathological, hatred, for, the, country, where, he, was, born, and, grew, up, for, the, socialist, system, and, for, soviet, people, during, this, period, he, was, sheltered, by, the, cellist, mstislav, rostropovich, who, suffered, considerably, for, his, support, of, solzhenitsyn, and, was, eventually, forced, into, exile, himself, in, a, discussion, of, its, options, in, dealing, with, solzhenitsyn, the, members, of, the, politburo, considered, his, arrest, and, imprisonment, and, his, expulsion, to, a, capitalist, country, willing, to, take, him, guided, by, kgb, chief, yuri, andropov, and, following, a, statement, from, west, german,

the, poem, prussian, nights, keeping, the, kgb, informed, regarding, all, contacts, by, solzhenitsyn, the, kgb, also, sponsored, a, series, of, hostile, books, about, solzhenitsyn, most, notably, a, memoir, published, under, the, name, of, his, first, wife, natalia, reshetovskaya, but, probably, mostly, composed, by, service, a, according, to, historian, christopher, andrew, andropov, also, gave, an, order, to, create, an, atmosphere, of, distrust, and, suspicion, between, pauk, and, the, people, around, him, by, feeding, him, rumors, that, the, people, around, him, were, kgb, agents, and, deceiving, him, at, every, opportunity, among, other, things, he, continually, received, envelopes, with, photographs, of, car, crashes, brain, surgery, and, other, disturbing, imagery, after, the, kgb, harassment, in, z, rich, solzhenitsyn, settled, in, cavendish, vermont, and, reduced, communications, with, others, his, influence, and, moral, authority, for, the, west, diminished, as, he, became, increasingly, isolated, and, critical, of, western, individualism, kgb, and, cpsu, experts, finally, concluded, that, he, alienated, american, listeners, by, his, reactionary, views, and, intransigent, criticism, of, the, us, way, of, life, so, no, further, active, measures, would, be, required, over, the, next, 17, years, solzhenitsyn, worked, on, his, dramatized, history, of, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, the, red, wheel, by, 1992, four, sections, had, been, completed, and, he, had, also, written, several, shorter, works, solzhenitsyn, s, warnings, about, the, dangers, of, communist, aggression, and, the, weakening, of, the, moral, fiber, of, the, west, were, generally, well, received, in, western, conservative, circles, e, g, ford, administration, staffers, dick, cheney, and, donald, rumsfeld, advocated, on, solzhenitsyn, s, behalf, for, him, to, speak, directly, to, president, gerald, ford, about, the, soviet, threat, prior, to, and, alongside, the, tougher, foreign, policy, pursued, by, us, president, ronald, reagan, at, the, same, time, liberals, and, secularists, became, increasingly, critical, of, what, they, perceived, as, his, reactionary, preference, for, russian, nationalism, and, the, russian, orthodox, religion, solzhenitsyn, also, harshly, criticised, what, he, saw, as, the, ugliness, and, spiritual, vapidity, of, the, dominant, pop, culture, of, the, modern, west, including, television, and, much, of, popular, music, the, human, soul, longs, for, things, higher, warmer, and, purer, than, those, offered, by, today, s, mass, living, habits, by, tv, stupor, and, by, intolerable, music, despite, his, criticism, of, the, weakness, of, the, west, solzhenitsyn, always, made, clear, that, he, admired, the, political, liberty, which, was, one, of, the, enduring, strengths, of, western, democratic, societies, in, a, major, speech, delivered, to, the, international, academy, of, philosophy, in, liechtenstein, on, 14, september, 1993, solzhenitsyn, implored, the, west, not, to, lose, sight, of, its, own, values, its, historically, unique, stability, of, civic, life, under, the, rule, of, law, a, hard, won, stability, which, grants, independence, and, space, to, every, private, citizen, in, a, series, of, writings, speeches, and, interviews, after, his, return, to, his, native, russia, in, 1994, solzhenitsyn, spoke, about, his, admiration, for, the, local, self, government, he, had, witnessed, first, hand, in, switzerland, and, new, england, he, praised, the, sensible, and, sure, process, of, grassroots, democracy, in, which, the, local, population, solves, most, of, its, problems, on, its, own, not, waiting, for, the, decisions, of, higher, authorities, solzhenitsyn, s, patriotism, was, inward, looking, he, called, for, russia, to, renounce, all, mad, fantasies, of, foreign, conquest, and, begin, the, peaceful, long, long, long, period, of, recuperation, as, he, put, it, in, a, 1979, bbc, interview, with, latvian, born, bbc, journalist, janis, sapiets, in, 1990, his, soviet, citizenship, was, restored, and, in, 1994, he, returned, to, russia, with, his, wife, natalia, who, had, become, a, united, states, citizen, their, sons, stayed, behind, in, the, united, states, later, his, eldest, son, yermolai, returned, to, russia, from, then, until, his, death, he, lived, with, his, wife, in, a, dacha, in, troitse, lykovo, in, west, moscow, between, the, dachas, once, occupied, by, soviet, leaders, mikhail, suslov, and, konstantin, chernenko, a, staunch, believer, in, traditional, russian, culture, solzhenitsyn, expressed, his, disillusionment, with, post, soviet, russia, in, works, such, as, rebuilding, russia, and, called, for, the, establishment, of, a, strong, presidential, republic, balanced, by, vigorous, institutions, of, local, self, government, the, latter, would, remain, his, major, political, theme, solzhenitsyn, also, published, eight, two, part, short, stories, a, series, of, contemplative, miniatures, or, prose, poems, and, a, literary, memoir, on, his, years, in, the, west, the, grain, between, the, millstones, translated, and, released, as, two, works, by, the, university, of, notre, dame, as, part, of, the, kennan, institute, s, solzhenitsyn, initiative, the, first, between, two, millstones, book, 1, sketches, of, exile, 1974, 1978, was, translated, by, peter, constantine, and, published, in, october, 2018, the, second, book, 2, exile, in, america, 1978, 1994, translated, by, clare, kitson, and, melanie, moore, and, published, in, october, 2020, once, back, in, russia, solzhenitsyn, hosted, a, television, talk, show, program, its, eventual, format, was, solzhenitsyn, delivering, a, 15, minute, monologue, twice, a, month, it, was, discontinued, in, 1995, solzhenitsyn, became, a, supporter, of, vladimir, putin, who, said, he, shared, solzhenitsyn, s, critical, view, towards, the, russian, revolution, all, of, solzhenitsyn, s, sons, became, u, s, citizens, one, ignat, is, a, pianist, and, conductor, another, solzhenitsyn, son, yermolai, works, for, the, moscow, office, of, mckinsey, company, a, management, consultancy, firm, where, he, is, a, senior, partner, solzhenitsyn, died, of, heart, failure, near, moscow, on, 3, august, 2008, at, the, age, of, 89, a, burial, service, was, held, at, donskoy, monastery, moscow, on, 6, august, 2008, he, was, buried, the, same, day, in, the, monastery, in, a, spot, he, had, chosen, russian, and, world, leaders, paid, tribute, to, solzhenitsyn, following, his, death, defunct, according, to, william, harrison, solzhenitsyn, was, an, arch, reactionary, who, argued, that, the, soviet, state, suppressed, traditional, russian, and, ukrainian, culture, who, called, for, the, creation, of, a, united, slavic, state, encompassing, russia, ukraine, and, belarus, and, who, was, a, fierce, opponent, of, ukrainian, independence, it, is, well, documented, that, his, negative, views, on, ukrainian, independence, became, more, radical, over, the, years, harrison, also, alleged, that, solzhenitsyn, held, pan, slavist, and, monarchist, views, according, to, harrison, his, historical, writing, is, imbued, with, a, hankering, after, an, idealized, tsarist, era, when, seemingly, everything, was, rosy, he, sought, refuge, in, a, dreamy, past, where, he, believed, a, united, slavic, state, the, russian, empire, built, on, orthodox, foundations, had, provided, an, ideological, alternative, to, western, individualistic, liberalism, solzhenitsyn, also, repeatedly, denounced, tsar, alexis, of, russia, and, patriarch, nikon, of, moscow, for, causing, the, great, schism, of, 1666, which, solzhenitsyn, said, both, divided, and, weakened, the, russian, orthodox, church, at, a, time, when, unity, was, desperately, needed, solzhenitsyn, also, attacked, both, the, tsar, and, the, patriarch, for, using, excommunication, siberian, exile, imprisonment, torture, and, even, burning, at, the, stake, against, the, old, believers, who, rejected, the, liturgical, changes, which, caused, the, schism, solzhenitsyn, also, argued, that, the, dechristianization, of, russian, culture, which, he, considered, most, responsible, for, the, bolshevik, revolution, began, in, 1666, became, much, worse, during, the, reign, of, tsar, peter, the, great, and, accelerated, into, an, epidemic, during, the, enlightenment, the, romantic, era, and, the, silver, age, expanding, upon, this, theme, solzhenitsyn, once, declared, over, a, half, century, ago, while, i, was, still, a, child, i, recall, hearing, a, number, of, old, people, offer, the, following, explanation, for, the, great, disasters, that, had, befallen, russia, men, have, forgotten, god, that, s, why, all, this, has, happened, since, then, i, have, spent, well, nigh, 50, years, working, on, the, history, of, our, revolution, in, the, process, i, have, read, hundreds, of, books, collected, hundreds, of, personal, testimonies, and, have, already, contributed, eight, volumes, of, my, own, toward, the, effort, of, clearing, away, the, rubble, left, by, that, upheaval, but, if, i, were, asked, today, to, formulate, as, concisely, as, possible, the, main, cause, of, the, ruinous, revolution, that, swallowed, up, some, 60, million, of, our, people, i, could, not, put, it, more, accurately, than, to, repeat, men, have, forgotten, god, that, s, why, all, this, has, happened, in, an, interview, with, joseph, pearce, however, solzhenitsyn, commented, treated, amazingly, unjustly, because, some, very, insignificant, trifling, differences, in, ritual, which, were, promoted, with, poor, judgment, and, without, much, sound, basis, because, of, these, small, differences, they, were, persecuted, in, very, many, cruel, ways, they, were, suppressed, they, were, exiled, from, the, perspective, of, historical, justice, i, sympathise, with, them, and, i, am, on, their, side, but, this, in, no, way, ties, in, with, what, i, have, just, said, about, the, fact, that, religion, in, order, to, keep, up, with, mankind, must, adapt, its, forms, toward, modern, culture, in, other, words, do, i, agree, with, the, old, believers, that, religion, should, freeze, and, not, move, at, all, not, at, all, when, asked, by, pearce, for, his, opinions, about, the, division, within, the, roman, catholic, church, over, the, second, vatican, council, and, the, mass, of, paul, vi, solzhenitsyn, replied, a, question, peculiar, to, the, russian, orthodox, church, is, should, we, continue, to, use, old, church, slavonic, or, should, we, start, to, introduce, more, of, the, contemporary, russian, language, into, the, service, i, understand, the, fears, of, both, those, in, the, orthodox, and, in, the, catholic, church, the, wariness, the, hesitation, and, the, fear, that, this, is, lowering, the, church, to, the, modern, condition, the, modern, surroundings, i, understand, this, but, alas, i, fear, that, if, religion, does, not, allow, itself, to, change, it, will, be, impossible, to, return, the, world, to, religion, because, the, world, is, incapable, on, its, own, of, rising, as, high, as, the, old, demands, of, religion, religion, needs, to, come, and, meet, it, somewhat, surprised, to, hear, solzhenitsyn, so, often, perceived, as, an, arch, traditionalist, apparently, coming, down, on, the, side, of, the, reformers, pearce, then, asked, solzhenitsyn, what, he, thought, of, the, division, caused, within, the, anglican, communion, by, the, decision, to, ordain, female, priests, solzhenitsyn, replied, certainly, there, are, many, firm, boundaries, that, should, not, be, changed, when, i, speak, of, some, sort, of, correlation, between, the, cultural, norms, of, the, present, it, is, really, only, a, small, part, of, the, whole, thing, solzhenitsyn, then, added, certainly, i, do, not, believe, that, women, priests, is, the, way, to, go, in, his, 1974, essay, repentance, and, self, limitation, in, the, life, of, nations, solzhenitsyn, urged, russian, gentiles, and, jews, alike, to, take, moral, responsibility, for, the, renegades, from, both, communities, who, enthusiastically, embraced, atheism, and, marxism, leninism, and, participated, in, the, red, terror, and, many, other, acts, of, torture, and, mass, murder, following, the, october, revolution, solzhenitsyn, argued, that, both, russian, gentiles, and, jews, should, be, prepared, to, treat, the, atrocities, committed, by, jewish, and, gentile, bolsheviks, as, though, they, were, the, acts, of, their, own, family, members, before, their, consciences, and, before, god, solzhenitsyn, said, that, if, we, deny, all, responsibility, for, the, crimes, of, our, national, kin, the, very, concept, of, a, people, loses, all, meaning, in, a, review, of, solzhenitsyn, s, novel, august, 1914, in, the, new, york, times, on, 13, november, 1985, jewish, american, historian, richard, pipes, wrote, every, culture, has, its, own, brand, of, anti, semitism, in, solzhenitsyn, s, case, it, s, not, racial, it, has, nothing, to, do, with, blood, he, s, certainly, not, a, racist, the, question, is, fundamentally, religious, and, cultural, he, bears, some, resemblance, to, fyodor, dostoyevsky, who, was, a, fervent, christian, and, patriot, and, a, rabid, anti, semite, solzhenitsyn, is, unquestionably, in, the, grip, of, the, russian, extreme, right, s, view, of, the, revolution, which, is, that, it, was, the, doing, of, the, jews, award, winning, jewish, novelist, and, holocaust, survivor, elie, wiesel, disagreed, and, wrote, that, solzhenitsyn, was, too, intelligent, too, honest, too, courageous, too, great, a, writer, to, be, an, anti, semite, in, his, 1998, book, russia, in, collapse, solzhenitsyn, criticized, the, russian, far, right, s, obsession, with, anti, semitic, and, anti, masonic, conspiracy, theories, in, 2001, solzhenitsyn, published, a, two, volume, work, on, the, history, of, russian, jewish, relations, two, hundred, years, together, 2001, 2002, the, book, triggered, renewed, accusations, of, anti, semitism, in, the, book, he, repeated, his, call, for, russian, gentiles, and, jews, to, share, responsibility, for, everything, that, happened, in, the, soviet, union, he, also, downplayed, the, number, of, victims, of, an, 1882, pogrom, despite, current, evidence, and, failed, to, mention, the, beilis, affair, a, 1911, trial, in, kiev, where, a, jew, was, accused, of, ritually, murdering, christian, children, he, was, also, criticized, for, relying, on, outdated, scholarship, ignoring, current, western, scholarship, and, for, selectively, quoting, to, strengthen, his, preconceptions, such, as, that, the, soviet, union, often, treated, jews, better, than, non, jewish, russians, similarities, between, two, hundred, years, together, and, an, anti, semitic, essay, titled, jews, in, the, ussr, and, in, the, future, russia, attributed, to, solzhenitsyn, have, led, to, the, inference, that, he, stands, behind, the, anti, semitic, passages, solzhenitsyn, himself, explained, that, the, essay, consists, of, manuscripts, stolen, from, him, by, the, kgb, and, then, carefully, edited, to, appear, anti, semitic, before, being, published, 40, years, before, without, his, consent, according, to, the, historian, semyon, reznik, textological, analyses, have, proven, solzhenitsyn, s, authorship, solzhenitsyn, viewed, the, soviet, union, as, a, police, state, significantly, more, oppressive, than, the, russian, empire, s, house, of, romanov, he, asserted, that, imperial, russia, did, not, censor, literature, or, the, media, to, the, extremely, systematic, style, as, the, soviet, era, glavlit, that, tsarist, era, political, prisoners, were, not, forced, into, labor, camps, to, even, remotely, the, same, degree, and, that, the, number, of, political, prisoners, and, internal, exiles, under, the, romanovs, were, only, one, ten, thousandth, of, the, numbers, of, both, following, the, october, revolution, he, noted, that, the, tsar, s, secret, police, the, okhrana, was, only, present, in, the, three, largest, cities, and, not, at, all, in, the, imperial, russian, army, shortly, before, his, return, to, russia, solzhenitsyn, delivered, a, speech, in, les, lucs, sur, boulogne, to, commemorate, the, 200th, anniversary, of, the, vend, e, uprising, during, his, speech, solzhenitsyn, compared, lenin, s, bolsheviks, with, the, jacobin, club, during, the, french, revolution, he, also, compared, the, vendean, rebels, with, the, russian, ukrainian, and, cossack, peasants, who, rebelled, against, the, bolsheviks, saying, that, both, were, destroyed, mercilessly, by, revolutionary, despotism, he, commented, that, while, the, french, reign, of, terror, ended, with, the, thermidorian, reaction, and, the, toppling, of, the, jacobins, and, the, execution, of, maximilien, robespierre, its, soviet, equivalent, continued, to, accelerate, until, the, khrushchev, thaw, of, the, 1950s, according, to, solzhenitsyn, russians, were, not, the, ruling, nation, in, the, soviet, union, he, believed, that, all, the, traditional, cultures, of, all, ethnic, groups, were, equally, oppressed, in, favor, of, atheism, and, marxist, leninism, traditional, russian, culture, was, even, more, repressed, than, any, other, culture, in, the, soviet, union, since, the, regime, was, more, afraid, of, peasant, uprisings, by, ethnic, russians, than, among, any, other, soviet, ethnic, group, therefore, solzhenitsyn, argued, moderate, and, non, colonialist, russian, nationalism, and, the, russian, orthodox, church, once, cleansed, of, caesaropapism, should, not, be, regarded, as, a, threat, to, the, civilization, of, the, west, but, rather, as, its, ally, solzhenitsyn, made, a, speaking, tour, after, francisco, franco, s, death, and, told, liberals, not, to, push, too, hard, for, changes, because, spain, had, more, freedoms, now, than, the, soviet, union, had, ever, known, as, reported, by, the, new, york, times, he, blamed, communism, for, the, death, of, 110, million, russians, and, derided, those, in, spain, who, complained, of, dictatorship, solzhenitsyn, recalled, i, had, to, explain, to, the, people, of, spain, in, the, most, concise, possible, terms, what, it, meant, to, have, been, subjugated, by, an, ideology, as, we, in, the, soviet, union, had, been, and, give, the, spanish, to, understand, what, a, terrible, fate, they, escaped, in, 1939, this, was, because, solzhenitsyn, saw, at, least, some, parallels, between, the, spanish, civil, war, between, the, nationalists, and, the, republicans, and, the, russian, civil, war, between, the, anti, communist, white, army, and, the, communist, red, army, this, was, neither, a, popular, or, commonly, held, view, at, that, time, winston, lord, a, prot, g, of, the, then, united, states, secretary, of, state, henry, kissinger, called, solzhenitsyn, just, about, a, fascist, and, elisa, kriza, alleged, that, solzhenitsyn, held, benevolent, views, on, francoist, spain, because, it, was, a, pro, christian, government, and, his, christian, worldview, operated, ideologically, in, the, little, grain, managed, to, land, between, two, millstones, the, nationalist, uprising, against, the, second, spanish, republic, is, held, up, as, a, model, of, a, proper, christian, response, to, religious, persecution, by, the, far, left, such, as, the, spanish, red, terror, by, the, republican, forces, according, to, peter, brooke, however, solzhenitsyn, in, reality, approached, the, position, argued, by, christian, dmitri, panin, with, whom, he, had, a, fall, out, in, exile, namely, that, evil, must, be, confronted, by, force, and, the, centralised, spiritually, independent, roman, catholic, church, is, better, placed, to, do, it, than, orthodoxy, with, its, otherworldliness, and, tradition, of, subservience, to, the, state, in, 1983, he, met, margaret, thatcher, and, told, her, the, german, army, could, have, liberated, the, soviet, union, from, communism, but, hitler, was, stupid, and, did, not, use, this, weapon, in, rebuilding, russia, an, essay, first, published, in, 1990, in, komsomolskaya, pravda, solzhenitsyn, urged, the, soviet, union, to, grant, independence, to, all, the, non, slav, republics, which, he, claimed, were, sapping, the, russian, nation, and, he, called, for, the, creation, of, a, new, slavic, state, bringing, together, russia, ukraine, belarus, and, parts, of, kazakhstan, that, he, considered, to, be, russified, regarding, ukraine, he, wrote, all, the, talk, of, a, separate, ukrainian, people, existing, since, something, like, the, ninth, century, and, possessing, its, own, non, russian, language, is, recently, invented, falsehood, and, we, all, sprang, from, precious, kiev, in, some, of, his, later, political, writings, such, as, rebuilding, russia, 1990, and, russia, in, collapse, 1998, solzhenitsyn, criticized, the, oligarchic, excesses, of, the, new, russian, democracy, while, opposing, any, nostalgia, for, soviet, communism, he, defended, moderate, and, self, critical, patriotism, as, opposed, to, extreme, nationalism, he, also, urged, for, local, self, government, similar, to, what, he, had, seen, in, new, england, town, meetings, and, in, the, cantons, of, switzerland, he, also, expressed, concern, for, the, fate, of, the, 25, million, ethnic, russians, in, the, near, abroad, of, the, former, soviet, union, in, an, interview, with, joseph, pearce, solzhenitsyn, was, asked, whether, he, felt, that, the, socioeconomic, theories, of, e, f, schumacher, were, the, key, to, society, rediscovering, its, sanity, he, replied, i, do, believe, that, it, would, be, the, key, but, i, don, t, think, this, will, happen, because, people, succumb, to, fashion, and, they, suffer, from, inertia, and, it, is, hard, to, them, to, come, round, to, a, different, point, of, view, solzhenitsyn, refused, to, accept, russia, s, highest, honor, the, order, of, st, andrew, in, 1998, solzhenitsyn, later, said, in, 1998, it, was, the, country, s, low, point, with, people, in, misery, yeltsin, decreed, i, be, honored, the, highest, state, order, i, replied, that, i, was, unable, to, receive, an, award, from, a, government, that, had, led, russia, into, such, dire, straits, in, a, 2003, interview, with, joseph, pearce, solzhenitsyn, said, we, are, exiting, from, communism, in, a, most, unfortunate, and, awkward, way, it, would, have, been, difficult, to, design, a, path, out, of, communism, worse, than, the, one, that, has, been, followed, in, a, 2007, interview, with, der, spiegel, solzhenitsyn, expressed, disappointment, that, the, conflation, of, soviet, and, russian, against, which, he, spoke, so, often, in, the, 1970s, had, not, passed, away, in, the, west, in, the, ex, socialist, countries, or, in, the, former, soviet, republics, he, commented, the, elder, political, generation, in, communist, countries, is, not, ready, for, repentance, while, the, new, generation, is, only, too, happy, to, voice, grievances, and, level, accusations, with, present, day, moscow, a, convenient, target, they, behave, as, if, they, heroically, liberated, themselves, and, lead, a, new, life, now, while, moscow, has, remained, communist, nevertheless, i, dare, hope, that, this, unhealthy, phase, will, soon, be, over, that, all, the, peoples, who, have, lived, through, communism, will, understand, that, communism, is, to, blame, for, the, bitter, pages, of, their, history, in, 2008, solzhenitsyn, praised, putin, saying, russia, was, rediscovering, what, it, meant, to, be, russian, solzhenitsyn, also, praised, the, russian, president, dmitry, medvedev, as, a, nice, young, man, who, was, capable, of, taking, on, the, challenges, russia, was, facing, once, in, the, united, states, solzhenitsyn, sharply, criticized, the, west, solzhenitsyn, criticized, the, allies, for, not, opening, a, new, front, against, nazi, germany, in, the, west, earlier, in, world, war, ii, this, resulted, in, soviet, domination, and, control, of, the, nations, of, eastern, europe, solzhenitsyn, claimed, the, western, democracies, apparently, cared, little, about, how, many, died, in, the, east, as, long, as, they, could, end, the, war, quickly, and, painlessly, for, themselves, in, the, west, delivering, the, commencement, address, at, harvard, university, in, 1978, he, argued, that, the, united, states, had, declined, in, terms, of, its, spiritual, life, and, called, for, a, spiritual, upsurge, he, added, should, someone, ask, me, whether, i, would, indicate, the, west, such, as, it, is, today, as, a, model, to, my, country, frankly, i, would, have, to, answer, negatively, he, critiqued, the, west, for, its, lack, of, religiosity, materialism, and, a, decline,
