of, the, stars, this, was, a, measurement, of, the, maximum, altitude, above, the, horizon, of, the, stars, it, was, only, possible, to, use, this, device, to, measure, the, declination, of, celestial, objects, the, image, which, can, be, found, in, this, article, shows, the, remaining, portion, of, the, instrument, which, consists, of, the, underground, lower, portion, of, the, instrument, that, was, not, destroyed, the, observatory, built, by, ulugh, beg, was, the, most, pervasive, and, well, known, observatory, throughout, the, islamic, world, with, the, instruments, located, in, the, observatory, in, samarkand, ulugh, beg, composed, a, star, catalogue, consisting, of, 1018, stars, which, is, eleven, fewer, stars, than, are, present, in, the, star, catalogue, of, ptolemy, ulugh, beg, utilized, dimensions, from, al, sufi, and, based, his, star, catalogue, on, a, new, analysis, that, was, autonomous, from, the, data, used, by, ptolemy, throughout, his, life, as,

compiled, the, 1437, zij, i, sultani, of, 994, stars, generally, considered, the, greatest, star, catalogue, between, those, of, ptolemy, and, tycho, brahe, a, work, that, stands, alongside, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, s, book, of, fixed, stars, the, serious, errors, which, he, found, in, previous, arabian, star, catalogues, many, of, which, had, simply, updated, ptolemy, s, work, adding, the, effect, of, precession, to, the, longitudes, induced, him, to, redetermine, the, positions, of, 992, fixed, stars, to, which, he, added, 27, stars, from, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, s, catalogue, book, of, fixed, stars, from, the, year, 964, which, were, too, far, south, for, observation, from, samarkand, this, catalogue, one, of, the, most, original, of, the, middle, ages, was, first, edited, by, thomas, hyde, at, oxford, in, 1665, under, the, title, jad, vil, i, mav, zi, s, av, bit, sive, tabulae, long, ac, lat, stellarum, fixarum, ex, observatione, ulugh, beighi, and, reprinted, in, 1767, by, g, sharpe, more, recent, editions, are, those, by, francis, baily, in, 1843, in, vol, xiii, of, the, memoirs, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, and, by, edward, ball, knobel, in, ulugh, beg,

length, of, the, sidereal, year, as, 365, 2570370, d, 365, d, 6, h, 10, m, 8, s, an, error, of, 58, seconds, in, his, measurements, over, the, course, of, many, years, he, used, a, 50, m, high, gnomon, this, value, was, improved, by, 28, seconds, in, 1525, by, nicolaus, copernicus, who, appealed, to, the, estimation, of, thabit, ibn, qurra, 826, 901, which, had, an, error, of, 2, seconds, however, ulugh, beg, later, measured, another, more, precise, value, of, the, tropical, year, as, 365, d, 5, h, 49, m, 15, s, which, has, an, error, of, 25, seconds, making, it, more, accurate, than, copernicus, s, estimate, which, had, an, error, of, 30, seconds, ulugh, beg, also, determined, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, as, 23, 30, 17, in, the, sexagesimal, system, of, degrees, minutes, and, seconds, of, arc, which, in, decimal, notation, converts, to, 23, 5047, in, mathematics, ulugh, beg, wrote, accurate, trigonometric, tables, of, sine, and, tangent, values, correct, to, at, least, eight, decimal, places, once, ulugh, beg, became, governor, of, samarqand, he, fostered, diplomatic, relations, with, the, yongle, emperor, of, the, ming, dynasty, in, 1416, ming, envoys, chen, cheng,
