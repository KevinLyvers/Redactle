louis, braille, b, r, e, l, brayl, french, 4, january, 1809, 6, january, 1852, was, a, french, educator, and, the, inventor, of, a, reading, and, writing, system, named, after, him, braille, intended, for, use, by, visually, impaired, people, his, system, is, used, worldwide, and, remains, virtually, unchanged, to, this, day, braille, was, blinded, at, the, age, of, three, in, one, eye, as, a, result, of, an, accident, with, a, stitching, awl, in, his, father, s, harness, making, shop, consequently, an, infection, set, in, and, spread, to, both, eyes, resulting, in, total, blindness, at, that, time, there, were, not, many, resources, in, place, for, the, blind, but, he, nevertheless, excelled, in, his, education, and, received, a, scholarship, to, france, s, royal, institute, for, blind, youth, while, still, a, student, there, he, began, developing, a, system, of, tactile, code, that, could, allow, blind, people, to, read, and, write, quickly, and, efficiently, inspired, by, a, system, invented, by, charles, barbier, braille, s, new, method, was, more, compact, and, lent, itself, to, a, range, of, uses, including, music, he, presented, his, work, to, his, peers, for, the, first, time, in, 1824, when, he, was, fifteen, years, old, in, adulthood, braille, served, as, a, professor, at, the, institute, and, had, an, avocation, as, a, musician, but, he, largely, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, refining, and, extending, his, system, it, went, unused, by, most, educators, for, many, years, after, his, death, but, posterity, has, recognized, braille, as, a, revolutionary, invention, and, it, has, been, adapted, for, use, in, languages, worldwide, louis, braille, was, born, in, coupvray, a, small, town, about, twenty, miles, east, of, paris, on, 4, january, 1809, he, and, his, three, elder, siblings, monique, catherine, b, 1793, louis, simon, b, 1795, and, marie, c, line, b, 1797, lived, with, their, parents, simon, ren, and, monique, on, three, hectares, of, land, and, vineyard, in, the, countryside, simon, ren, maintained, a, successful, enterprise, as, a, leatherer, and, maker, of, horse, tack, as, soon, as, he, could, walk, braille, s, time, was, spent, playing, in, his, father, s, workshop, at, the, age, of, three, he, was, playing, with, some, of, the, tools, trying, to, make, holes, in, a, piece, of, leather, with, an, awl, squinting, closely, at, the, surface, he, pressed, down, hard, to, drive, the, point, in, and, the, awl, glanced, across, the, tough, leather, and, stabbed, him, in, one, of, his, eyes, a, local, physician, bound, and, patched, the, affected, eye, and, even, arranged, for, braille, to, be, met, the, next, day, in, paris, by, a, surgeon, but, no, treatment, could, save, the, damaged, organ, in, agony, the, young, boy, suffered, for, weeks, as, the, wound, became, severely, infected, he, eventually, lost, sight, in, the, other, eye, likely, due, to, sympathetic, ophthalmia, a, braille, survived, the, torment, of, the, infection, but, by, the, age, of, five, he, was, completely, blind, in, both, eyes, due, to, his, young, age, he, did, not, realize, at, first, that, he, had, lost, his, sight, and, often, asked, why, it, was, always, dark, his, parents, made, many, efforts, quite, uncommon, for, the, era, to, raise, their, youngest, child, in, a, normal, fashion, and, he, prospered, in, their, care, he, learned, to, navigate, the, village, and, country, paths, with, canes, his, father, hewed, for, him, and, he, grew, up, seemingly, at, peace, with, his, disability, braille, s, bright, and, creative, mind, impressed, the, local, teachers, and, priests, and, he, was, accommodated, with, higher, education, braille, studied, in, coupvray, until, the, age, of, ten, because, of, his, intelligence, and, diligence, braille, was, permitted, to, attend, one, of, the, first, schools, for, blind, children, in, the, world, the, royal, institute, for, blind, youth, since, renamed, to, the, national, institute, for, blind, youth, in, paris, the, last, of, his, family, s, children, to, leave, the, household, braille, departed, for, the, school, in, february, 1819, at, that, time, the, royal, institute, was, an, underfunded, ramshackle, affair, but, it, provided, a, relatively, stable, environment, for, blind, children, to, learn, and, associate, together, the, children, were, taught, to, read, using, a, system, devised, by, the, school, s, founder, valentin, ha, y, not, blind, himself, ha, y, was, a, philanthropist, who, devoted, his, life, to, helping, the, blind, he, designed, and, manufactured, a, small, library, of, books, for, the, children, by, embossing, heavy, paper, with, the, raised, imprints, of, latin, letters, readers, would, trace, their, fingers, over, the, text, comprehending, slowly, but, in, a, traditional, fashion, which, ha, y, could, appreciate, braille, was, helped, by, ha, y, s, books, but, he, also, despaired, over, their, lack, of, depth, the, amount, of, information, retained, in, such, books, was, necessarily, minor, because, the, raised, letters, were, made, in, a, complex, artisanal, process, using, wet, paper, pressed, against, copper, wire, the, children, could, not, hope, to, write, by, themselves, so, that, the, young, louis, could, send, letters, back, home, simon, ren, provided, him, with, an, alphabet, made, from, bits, of, thick, leather, it, was, a, slow, and, cumbersome, process, but, the, boy, could, at, least, trace, the, letters, outlines, and, write, his, first, sentences, the, handcrafted, ha, y, books, all, came, in, uncomfortable, sizes, and, weights, for, children, they, were, laboriously, constructed, very, fragile, and, expensive, to, obtain, when, ha, y, s, school, first, opened, it, had, a, total, of, three, books, nonetheless, ha, y, promoted, their, use, with, zeal, to, him, the, books, presented, a, system, which, would, be, readily, approved, by, educators, and, indeed, they, seemed, at, the, time, to, offer, the, best, achievable, results, braille, and, his, schoolmates, however, could, detect, all, too, well, the, books, crushing, limitations, nonetheless, ha, y, s, efforts, still, provided, a, breakthrough, achievement, the, recognition, of, the, sense, of, touch, as, a, workable, strategy, for, sightless, reading, the, ha, y, system, s, main, drawback, in, the, opinion, of, at, least, one, author, was, that, it, was, talking, to, the, fingers, with, the, language, of, the, eye, braille, read, ha, y, s, books, repeatedly, and, he, was, equally, attentive, to, the, oral, instruction, offered, by, the, school, he, proved, to, be, a, highly, proficient, student, and, after, he, had, exhausted, the, school, s, curriculum, he, was, immediately, asked, to, remain, a, teacher, s, aide, by, 1833, he, was, elevated, to, a, full, professorship, for, much, of, the, rest, of, his, life, braille, stayed, at, the, institute, where, he, taught, history, geometry, and, algebra, braille, s, ear, for, music, enabled, him, to, become, an, accomplished, cellist, and, organist, in, classes, taught, by, jean, nicolas, marrigues, later, in, life, his, musical, talents, led, him, to, play, the, organ, for, churches, all, over, france, a, devout, catholic, braille, held, the, position, of, organist, in, paris, at, the, church, of, saint, nicolas, des, champs, from, 1834, to, 1839, and, later, at, the, church, of, saint, vincent, de, paul, in, 1821, braille, learned, of, a, communication, system, devised, by, charles, barbier, barbier, aware, of, its, potential, for, helping, the, blind, to, read, and, write, wrote, to, the, school, to, introduce, his, method, barbier, s, invention, was, a, code, of, up, to, twelve, dots, in, two, columns, impressed, into, thick, paper, these, impressions, could, be, interpreted, entirely, by, the, fingers, barbier, s, code, of, raised, dots, inspired, braille, to, develop, a, system, of, his, own, braille, was, determined, to, invent, a, system, of, reading, and, writing, that, could, bridge, the, gap, in, communication, between, the, sighted, and, the, blind, in, his, own, words, access, to, communication, in, the, widest, sense, is, access, to, knowledge, and, that, is, vitally, important, for, us, if, we, are, not, to, go, on, being, despised, or, patronized, by, condescending, sighted, people, we, do, not, need, pity, nor, do, we, need, to, be, reminded, we, are, vulnerable, we, must, be, treated, as, equals, and, communication, is, the, way, this, can, be, brought, about, braille, reworked, barbier, s, system, by, simplifying, its, form, and, maximizing, its, efficiency, he, made, uniform, columns, for, each, letter, and, reduced, the, maximum, of, twelve, raised, dots, to, six, his, first, version, used, both, dots, and, dashes, he, published, this, version, in, 1829, but, by, the, second, edition, in, 1837, discarded, the, dashes, because, they, were, too, difficult, to, read, crucially, braille, s, smaller, cells, were, capable, of, being, recognized, as, letters, with, a, single, touch, of, a, finger, braille, created, his, own, raised, dot, system, using, barbier, s, slate, and, stylus, tools, barbier, had, donated, many, sets, of, these, tools, to, the, school, by, soldering, metal, strips, across, the, slate, braille, created, a, secure, area, for, the, stylus, which, would, keep, the, lines, straight, and, readable, by, these, modest, means, braille, constructed, a, robust, communication, system, it, bears, the, stamp, of, genius, wrote, dr, richard, slating, french, former, director, of, the, california, school, for, the, blind, like, the, roman, alphabet, itself, the, system, was, soon, extended, to, include, braille, musical, notation, passionate, about, his, own, music, braille, took, meticulous, care, in, its, planning, to, ensure, that, the, musical, code, would, be, flexible, enough, to, meet, the, unique, requirements, of, any, instrument, in, 1829, he, published, the, first, book, about, his, system, method, of, writing, words, music, and, plainsong, by, means, of, dots, for, use, by, the, blind, and, arranged, for, them, ironically, this, book, was, first, printed, by, the, raised, letter, method, of, the, ha, y, system, braille, produced, several, written, works, about, braille, and, as, general, education, for, the, blind, method, of, writing, words, music, and, plainsong, 1829, was, revised, and, republished, in, 1837, his, mathematics, guide, little, synopsis, of, arithmetic, for, beginners, entered, use, in, 1838, and, his, monograph, new, method, for, representing, by, dots, the, form, of, letters, maps, geometric, figures, musical, symbols, etc, for, use, by, the, blind, was, first, published, in, 1839, many, of, braille, s, original, printed, works, remain, available, at, the, braille, birthplace, museum, in, coupvray, new, method, for, representing, by, dots, 1839, put, forth, braille, s, plan, for, a, new, writing, system, with, which, blind, people, could, write, letters, that, could, be, read, by, sighted, people, called, decapoint, the, system, combined, his, method, of, dot, punching, with, a, new, specialized, grill, which, braille, devised, to, overlay, the, paper, when, used, with, an, associated, number, table, also, designed, by, braille, and, requiring, memorization, the, grill, could, permit, a, blind, writer, to, faithfully, reproduce, the, standard, alphabet, after, the, introduction, of, decapoint, braille, assisted, his, friend, pierre, fran, ois, victor, foucault, who, invented, the, raphigraphe, a, device, that, allowed, for, more, rapid, creation, of, letters, made, with, raised, points, foucault, s, machine, was, hailed, as, a, great, success, and, was, exhibited, at, the, world, s, fair, in, paris, in, 1855, dr, alexandre, ren, pignier, principal, at, the, school, supported, braille, s, work, and, allowed, the, teaching, of, braille, s, system, however, pignier, was, forced, out, of, his, position, in, 1840, by, an, ambitious, younger, teacher, pierre, armand, dufau, who, opposed, the, teaching, of, braille, at, the, school, fortunately, another, teacher, joseph, guadet, supported, braille, and, the, system, was, reintroduced, in, 1844, at, the, time, of, the, opening, of, a, new, school, building, on, the, boulevard, des, invalides, braille, had, always, been, a, sickly, child, and, his, condition, worsened, in, adulthood, a, persistent, respiratory, illness, long, believed, to, be, tuberculosis, dogged, him, despite, the, lack, of, a, cure, at, the, time, braille, lived, with, the, illness, for, 16, years, by, the, age, of, 40, he, was, forced, to, relinquish, his, position, as, a, teacher, when, his, condition, reached, mortal, danger, he, was, admitted, to, the, infirmary, at, the, royal, institution, where, he, died, in, 1852, two, days, after, he, turned, 43, because, of, the, overwhelming, insistence, of, the, blind, pupils, braille, s, system, was, finally, adopted, by, the, institute, in, 1854, two, years, after, his, death, the, system, spread, throughout, the, french, speaking, world, but, was, slower, to, expand, in, other, places, however, by, the, time, of, the, first, all, european, conference, of, teachers, of, the, blind, in, 1873, the, cause, of, braille, was, championed, by, dr, thomas, rhodes, armitage, and, thereafter, its, international, use, increased, rapidly, by, 1882, dr, armitage, was, able, to, report, that, there, is, now, probably, no, institution, in, the, civilized, world, where, braille, is, not, used, except, in, some, of, those, in, north, america, eventually, even, these, holdouts, relented, braille, was, officially, adopted, by, schools, for, the, blind, in, the, united, states, in, 1916, and, a, universal, braille, code, for, english, was, formalized, in, 1932, new, variations, in, braille, technology, continue, to, grow, including, such, innovations, as, braille, computer, terminals, robobraille, email, delivery, service, and, nemeth, braille, a, comprehensive, system, for, mathematical, and, scientific, notation, almost, two, centuries, after, its, invention, braille, remains, a, system, of, powerful, and, enduring, utility, the, immense, personal, legacy, of, louis, braille, was, described, in, a, 1952, essay, by, t, s, eliot, perhaps, the, most, enduring, honor, to, the, memory, of, louis, braille, is, the, half, conscious, honor, we, pay, him, by, applying, his, name, to, the, script, he, invented, and, in, this, country, adapting, the, pronunciation, of, his, name, to, our, own, language, we, honor, braille, when, we, speak, of, braille, his, memory, has, in, this, way, a, security, greater, than, that, of, the, memories, of, many, men, more, famous, in, their, day, braille, s, childhood, home, in, coupvray, is, a, listed, historic, building, and, houses, the, louis, braille, museum, a, large, monument, to, him, was, erected, in, the, town, square, which, was, itself, renamed, braille, square, on, the, centenary, of, his, death, his, remains, were, moved, to, the, panth, on, in, paris, in, a, symbolic, gesture, braille, s, hands, were, left, in, coupvray, reverently, buried, near, his, home, statues, and, other, memorials, to, louis, braille, can, be, found, around,
