a, full, expedition, member, the, greatest, honour, that, had, ever, been, paid, me, forged, a, lasting, friendship, between, norgay, and, his, swiss, friends, in, particular, raymond, lambert,

the, bottom, by, norgay, s, prompt, action, in, securing, the, rope, using, his, ice, axe, which, led, hillary, to, consider, him, the, climbing, partner, of, choice, for, any, future, summit, attempt, at, the, time, newspaper, reports, variously, referred, to, him, as, tensing, tenzing, tenzing, bhotia, tenzing, norgay, tensing, norkey, tenzing, sherpa, or, dan, shin, as, one, indian, academic, suggested, the, hunt, expedition, totalled, over, 400, people, including, 362, porters, 20, sherpa, guides, and, 10, 000, pounds, 4, 500, kg, of, baggage, and, like, many, such, expeditions, was, a, team, effort, the, expedition, set, up, base, camp, in, march, 1953, hillary, wrote, in, 1975, about, first, meeting, norgay, in, kathmandu, on, 5, march, 1953, i, was, eager, to, meet, tenzing, norgay, his, reputation, had, been, most, impressive, even, before, his, two, great, efforts, with, the, swiss, expedition, tenzing, really, looked, the, part, larger, than, most, sherpas, he, was, very, strong, and, active, his, flashing, smile, was, irresistible, and, he, was, incredibly, patient, with, all, our, questions, and, requests, his, success, in, the, past, had, given, him, great, physical, confidence, i, think, that, even, then, he, expected, to, be, a, member, of, the, final, assault, party, one, message, came, through, however, in, very, positive, fashion, tenzing, had, substantially, greater, personal, ambition, than, any, sherpa, i, had, met, working, slowly, the, expedition, set, up, their, penultimate, camp, at, the, south, col, at, 25, 900, feet, 7, 900, m, on, 26, may, tom, bourdillon, and, charles, evans, attempted, the, climb, but, turned, back, when, evans, oxygen, system, failed, the, pair, had, reached, the, south, summit, coming, within, 300, vertical, feet, 91, m, of, the, summit, hunt, then, directed, norgay, and, hillary, to, go, for, the, summit, snow, and, wind, held, the, pair, up, at, the, south, col, for, two, days, they, set, out, on, 28, may, with, a, support, trio, comprising, ang, nyima, alfred, gregory, and, george, lowe, norgay, and, hillary, pitched, a, tent, at, 27, 900, feet, 8, 500, m, on, 28, may, while, their, support, group, returned, down, the, mountain, on, the, following, morning, hillary, discovered, that, his, boots, had, frozen, solid, outside, the, tent, he, spent, two, hours, warming, them, before, he, and, tenzing, attempted, the, final, ascent, wearing, 30, pound, 14, kg, packs, the, last, part, of, the, ascent, comprised, a, 40, foot, 12, m, rock, face, later, named, the, hillary, step, hillary, saw, a, means, to, wedge, his, way, up, a, crack, in, the, face, between, the, rock, wall, and, the, ice, and, norgay, followed, from, there, the, following, effort, was, relatively, simple, they, reached, everest, s, 29, 028, foot, 8, 848, m, summit, the, highest, point, on, earth, at, 11, 30, a, m, as, hillary, put, it, a, few, more, whacks, of, the, ice, axe, in, the, firm, snow, and, we, stood, on, top, they, spent, only, about, 15, minutes, at, the, summit, hillary, took, the, famous, photo, of, norgay, posing, with, his, ice, axe, but, since, norgay, had, never, used, a, camera, hillary, s, ascent, went, unrecorded, however, according, to, norgay, s, autobiography, man, of, everest, when, norgay, offered, to, take, hillary, s, photograph, hillary, declined, i, motioned, to, hillary, that, i, would, now, take, his, picture, but, for, some, reason, he, shook, his, head, he, did, not, want, it, additional, photos, were, taken, looking, down, the, mountain, in, order, to, re, assure, that, they, had, made, it, to, the, top, and, to, document, that, the, ascent, was, not, faked, the, two, had, to, take, care, on, the, descent, after, discovering, that, drifting, snow, had, covered, their, tracks, complicating, the, task, of, retracing, their, steps, the, first, person, they, met, was, lowe, who, had, climbed, up, to, meet, them, with, hot, soup, afterwards, norgay, was, met, with, great, adulation, in, nepal, and, india, hillary, and, hunt, were, knighted, by, queen, elizabeth, ii, while, norgay, received, the, george, medal, for, his, efforts, on, the, expedition, it, has, been, suggested, that, indian, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, refused, permission, for, norgay, to, be, knighted, it, has, been, a, long, road, from, a, mountain, coolie, a, bearer, of, loads, to, a, wearer, of, a, coat, with, rows, of, medals, who, is, carried, about, in, planes, and, worries, about, income, tax, nonetheless, there, was, some, inequity, according, to, national, geographic, hillary, was, knighted, for, being, the, first, known, person, to, climb, to, the, top, of, mount, everest, but, tenzing, who, simultaneously, reached, its, summit, only, received, an, honorary, medal, in, the, years, since, there, s, been, growing, disquiet, at, the, lack, of, official, recognition, norgay, and, hillary, were, the, first, people, to, conclusively, set, foot, on, the, summit, of, mount, everest, but, journalists, were, persistently, repeating, the, question, which, of, the, two, men, had, the, right, to, the, glory, of, being, the, first, one, and, who, was, merely, the, second, the, follower, colonel, hunt, the, expedition, leader, declared, they, reached, it, together, as, a, team, norgay, eventually, ended, the, speculation, by, revealing, that, hillary, was, first, in, his, 1955, autobiography, it, was, ghost, written, by, american, writer, james, ramsay, ullman, as, tenzing, could, speak, several, languages, but, could, not, read, or, write, they, were, roped, six, feet, apart, with, most, of, the, 30, foot, rope, in, loops, in, his, hand, a, little, below, the, summit, hillary, and, i, stopped, i, was, not, thinking, of, first, and, second, i, did, not, say, to, myself, there, is, a, golden, apple, up, there, i, will, push, hillary, aside, and, run, for, it, we, went, on, slowly, steadily, and, then, we, were, there, hillary, stepped, on, top, first, and, i, stepped, up, after, him, now, the, truth, is, told, and, i, am, ready, to, be, judged, by, it, tenzing, norgay, became, the, first, director, of,
