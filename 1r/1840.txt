paavo, johannes, nurmi, finnish, pronunciation, 13, june, 1897, 2, october, 1973, was, a, finnish, middle, distance, and, long, distance, runner, he, was, called, the, flying, finn, or, the, phantom, finn, because, he, dominated, distance, running, in, the, 1920s, nurmi, set, 22, official, world, records, at, distances, between, 1, 500, metres, and, 20, kilometres, and, won, nine, gold, and,

career, he, remained, unbeaten, in, cross, country, events, and, the, 10, 000, metres, born, into, a, working, class, family, nurmi, left, school, at, the, age, of, 12, to, provide, for, his, family, in, 1912, he, was, inspired, by, the, olympic, feats, of, hannes, kolehmainen, and, began, developing, a, strict, training, program, nurmi, started, to, flourish, during, his, military, service, setting, finnish, records, in, athletics, en, route, to, his, international, debut, at, the, 1920, summer, olympics, after, winning, a, silver, medal, in, the, 5, 000, m, he, won, gold, in, the, 10,

which, has, never, been, repeated, he, set, new, world, records, for, the, 1, 500, m, and, the, 5, 000, m, with, just, an, hour, between, the, races, and, took, gold, medals, in, both, distances, in, less, than, two, hours, at, the, 1924, summer, olympics, seemingly, unaffected, by, the, paris, heat, wave, nurmi, won, all, his, races, and, returned, home, with, five, gold, medals, although, he, was, frustrated, that, finnish, officials, had, refused, to, enter, him, for, the, 10, 000, m, struggling, with, injuries, and, motivation, issues, after, his, exhaustive, u, s, tour, in, 1925, nurmi, found, his, long, time, rivals, compatriot, ville, ritola, and, sweden, s, edvin, wide, ever, more, serious, challengers, at, the, 1928, summer, olympics, nurmi, recaptured, the, 10, 000, m, title, but, was, beaten, for, the, gold, in, the, 5, 000, m, and, the, 3, 000, m, steeplechase, he, then, turned, his, attention, to, longer, distances, breaking, the, world, records, for, events, such, as, the, one, hour, run, and, the, 25, mile, marathon, nurmi, intended, to, end, his, career, with, a, marathon, gold, medal, as, his, idol, kolehmainen, had, done, in, a, controversial, case, that, strained, finland, sweden, relations, and, sparked, an, inter, iaaf, battle, nurmi, was, suspended, before, the, 1932, games, by, an, iaaf, council, that, questioned, his, amateur, status, two, days, before, the, opening, ceremonies, the, council, rejected, his, entries, although, he, was, never, declared, a, professional, nurmi, s, suspension, became, definite, in, 1934, and, he, retired, from, running, nurmi, later, coached, finnish, runners, raised, funds, for, finland, during, the, winter, war, and, worked, as, a, haberdasher, building, contractor, and, stock, trader, becoming, one, of, the, richest, people, in, finland, in, 1952, he, was, the, lighter, of, the, olympic, flame, at, the, summer, olympics, in, helsinki, nurmi, s, running, speed, and, elusive, personality, spawned, nicknames, such, as, the, phantom, finn, while, his, achievements, training, methods, and, running, style, influenced, future, generations, of, middle, and, long, distance, runners, nurmi, who, rarely, ran, without, a, stopwatch, in, his, hand, has, been, credited, with, introducing, the, even, pace, strategy, and, analytic, approach, to, running, and, for, making, running, a, major, international, sport, nurmi, was, born, in, turku, finland, to, carpenter, johan, fredrik, nurmi, and, his, wife, matilda, wilhelmiina, laine, nurmi, s, siblings, siiri, saara, martti, and, lahja,

boy, for, a, bakery, although, he, stopped, running, actively, he, got, plenty, of, exercise, pushing, heavy, carts, up, the, steep, slopes, in, turku, he, later, credited, these, climbs, for, strengthening, his, back, and, leg, muscles, at, 15, nurmi, rekindled, his, interest, in, athletics, after, being, inspired, by, the, performances, of, hannes, kolehmainen, who, was, said, to, have, run, finland, onto, the, map, of, the, world, at, the, 1912, summer, olympics, he, bought, his, first, pair, of, sneakers, a, few, days, later, nurmi, trained, primarily, by, doing, cross, country,

nurmi, remained, politically, passive, and, concentrated, on, his, work, and, his, olympic, ambitions, after, the, war, he, decided, not, to, join, the, newly, founded, finnish, workers, sports, federation, but, wrote, articles, for, the, federation, s, chief, organ, and, criticized, the, discrimination, against, many, of, his, fellow, workers, and, athletes, in, the, army, nurmi, quickly, impressed, in, the, athletic, competitions, while, others, marched, nurmi, ran, the, whole, distances, with, a, rifle, on, his, shoulder, and, a, backpack, full, of, sand, nurmi, s, stubbornness, caused, him, difficulties, with, his, non, commissioned, officers, but, he, was, favoured, by, the, superior, officers, despite, his, refusal, to, take, the, military, oath, even, at, the, threat, of, a, court, martial, as, the, unit, commander, hugo, sterman, was, a, known, sports, aficionado, nurmi, and, a, few, other, athletes, were, given, free, time, to, practice, nurmi, improvised, new, training, methods, in, the, army, barracks, he, ran, behind, trains, holding, on, to, the, rear, bumper, to, stretch, his, stride, and, used, heavy, iron, clad, army, boots, to, strengthen, his, legs,

to, study, at, the, teollisuuskoulu, industrial, school, in, helsinki, buoyed, by, his, defeat, to, guillemot, nurmi, s, races, became, a, series, of, experiments, which, he, analyzed, meticulously, previously, known, for, his, blistering, pace, on, the, first, few, laps, nurmi, started, to, carry, a, stopwatch, and, spread, his, efforts, more, uniformly, over, the, distance, he, aimed, to, perfect, his, technique, and, tactics, to, a, point, where, the, performances, of, his, rivals, would, be, rendered, meaningless, nurmi, set, his, first, world, record, on, the, 10, 000, m, in,

ritola, who, had, already, won, the, 3000, m, steeplechase, and, the, 10, 000, m, ritola, and, edvin, wide, figured, that, nurmi, must, be, tired, and, tried, to, burn, him, off, by, running, at, world, record, pace, realizing, that, he, was, now, racing, the, two, men, and, not, the, clock, nurmi, tossed, his, stopwatch, onto, the, grass, the, finns, later, passed, the, swede, as, his, pace, faded, and, continued, their, duel, on, the, home, straight, ritola, sprinted, from, the, outside, but, nurmi, increased, his, pace, to, keep, his, rival, a, metre, behind, in, the, cross, country,

half, as, finland, looked, to, have, lost, the, team, medal, the, disoriented, liimatainen, staggered, into, the, stadium, but, was, barely, moving, forward, an, athlete, ahead, of, him, fainted, 50, metres, from, the, finish, and, liimatainen, stopped, and, tried, to, find, his, way, off, the, track, thinking, he, had, reached, the, finish, line, after, having, ignored, shouts, and, kept, the, spectators, in, suspense, for, a, while, he, turned, into, the, right, direction, realised, his, situation, and, reached, the, finish, in, 12th, place, and, secured, team, gold, those, present, at, the, stadium, were, shocked, by, what, they, had, witnessed, and, olympic, officials, decided, to, ban, cross, country, running, from, future, games, in, the, 3000, m, team, race, on, the, next, day, nurmi, and, ritola, again, finished, first, and, second, and, elias, katz, secured, the, gold, medal, for, the, finnish, team, by, finishing, fifth, nurmi, had, won, five, gold, medals, in, five, events, but, he, left, the, games, embittered, as, the, finnish, officials, had, allocated, races, between, their, star, runners, and, prevented, him, from, defending, his, title, in, the, 10, 000, m, the, distance, that, was, dearest, to, him, after, returning, to, finland, nurmi, set, a, 10, 000, m, world, record, that, would, last, for, almost, 13, years, as, of, july, 2024, this, is, the,

121, race, four, year, win, streak, in, individual, scratch, races, at, distances, from, 800, m, upwards, although, he, hated, losing, more, than, anything, nurmi, was, the, first, to, congratulate, helffrich, the, tour, made, nurmi, extremely, popular, in, the, united, states, and, the, finn, agreed, to, meet, president, calvin, coolidge, at, the, white, house, nurmi, left, america, fearing, that, he, had, competed, too, often, and, burned, himself, out, nurmi, struggled, to, maintain, motivation, for, running, heightened, by, his, rheumatism, and, achilles, tendon, problems, he, quit, his, job, as, a, machinery, draughtsman, in, 1926, and, began, studying, business, intensively, as, nurmi, started, a, new, career, as, a, share, dealer, his, financial, advisors, included, risto,

third, in, the, 1500, m, by, eventual, gold, and, bronze, medalists, harri, larva, and, eino, purje, and, he, decided, to, concentrate, on, the, longer, distances, he, added, steeplechase, to, his, program, although, he, had, only, tried, the, event, twice, before, the, latest, being, a, two, mile, steeplechase, victory, at, the, 1922, british, championships, at, the, 1928, olympics, in,

my, last, season, on, the, track, i, am, beginning, to, get, old, i, have, raced, for, fifteen, years, and, have, had, enough, of, it, however, nurmi, continued, running, turning, his, attention, to,

at, the, indoor, wanamaker, mile, nurmi, was, seven, seconds, slower, than, in, his, world, record, run, in, 1925, and, it, was, immediately, speculated, if, the, mile, had, become, too, short, a, distance, for, him, in, 1930, he, set, a, new, world, record, for, the, 20, km, in, july, 1931, nurmi, showed, he, still, had, pace, for, the, shorter, distances, by, beating, lauri, lehtinen, lauri,

but, agreed, to, launch, an, investigation, it, was, customary, of, the, iaaf, to, accept, the, final, decision, of, its, national, branch, and, the, associated, press, wrote, that, there, is, little, doubt, that, if, the, finnish, federation, clears, nurmi, the, international, body, will, accept, its, decision, without, question, a, week, later, the, finnish, athletics, federation, ruled, in, favor, of, nurmi, finding, no, evidence, for, the, allegations, of, professionalism, nurmi, was, hopeful, that, his, suspension, would, be, lifted, in, time, for, the, games, on, 26, june, 1932,

problems, with, his, achilles, tendon, the, finnish, olympic, committee, entered, nurmi, for, both, the, 10, 000, m, and, the, marathon, the, guardian, reported, that, some, of, his, trial, times, were, almost, unbelievable, and, nurmi, went, on, to, train, at, the, olympic, village, in, los, angeles, despite, his, injury, nurmi, had, set, his, heart, on, ending, his, career, with, a, marathon, gold, medal, as, kolehmainen, had, done, shortly, after, the, first, world, war, less, than, three, days, before, the, 10, 000, m, a, special, commission, of, the, iaaf, consisting, of, the, same, seven, members, that, had, suspended, nurmi, rejected, the, finn, s, entries, and, barred, him, from, competing, in, los, angeles, sigfrid, edstr, m, the, swedish, chairman, of, the, council, of, the, international, association, of, athletics, federations, s, o, the, board, of, directors, pushed, independently, and, without, receiving, the, support, of, the, rules, of, the, international, association, of, athletics, federations, for, a, decision, to, ban, nurmi, from, participating, in, the, los, angeles, olympics, at, the, iaaf, board, meeting, without, consulting, the, finnish, sports, federation, sul, and, nurmi, on, 3, 4, and, 7, 30, 1932, edstr, m, stated, that, the, full, congress, of, the, iaaf, which, was, scheduled, to, start, the, next, day, could, not, reinstate, nurmi, for, the, olympics, but, merely, review, the, phases, and, political, angles, related, to, the, case, the, ap, called, this, one, of, the, slickest, political, maneuvers, in, international, athletic, history, and, wrote, that, the, games, would, now, be, like, hamlet, without, the, celebrated, dane, in, the, cast, thousands, protested, against, the, action, in, helsinki, details, of,

unmistakable, to, the, crowd, when, he, came, into, view, waves, of, sound, began, to, build, throughout, the, stadium, rising, to, a, roar, then, to, a, thunder, when, the, national, teams,

accomplish, something, nurmi, lived, to, see, the, renaissance, of, finnish, running, in, the, 1970s, led, by, athletes, such, as, the, 1972, olympic, gold, medalists, lasse, vir, n, and, pekka, vasala, he, had, complimented, the, running, style, of, vir, n, and, advised, vasala, to, concentrate, on, kipchoge, keino, although, he, accepted, an, invitation, from, president, lyndon, b, johnson, to, revisit, the, white, house, in, 1964, nurmi, lived, a, very, secluded, life, until, the, late, 1960s, when, he, began, granting, some, press, interviews, on, his, 70th, birthday, nurmi, agreed, to, an, interview, for, yle, finland, s, national, public, broadcasting, company, only, after, learning, that, president, kekkonen, would, act, as, the, interviewer, suffering, from, health, problems, with, at, least, one, heart, attack, a, stroke, and, failing, eyesight, nurmi, at, times, spoke, bitterly, about, sports, calling, it, a, waste, of, time, compared, to, science, and, art, he, died, in, 1973, in, helsinki, and, was, given, a, state, funeral, kekkonen, attended, the, funeral, and, praised, nurmi, people, explore, the, horizons, for, a, successor, but, none, comes, and, none, will, for, his, class, is, extinguished, with, him, at, the, request, of, nurmi, who, enjoyed, classical, music, and, played, the, violin, konsta, jylh, s, vaiennut, viulu, the, silenced, violin, was, played, during, the, ceremony, nurmi, s, last, record, fell, in, 1996, his, 1925, world, record, for, the, indoor, 2000, m, lasted, as, the, finnish, national, record, for, 71, years, nurmi, was,

and, stated, to, the, associated, press, in, 1933, is, concentration, on, athletics, at, last, forced, me, to, go, to, the, judge, for, a, divorce, matti, nurmi, did, become, a, middle, distance, runner, and, later, a, self, made, businessman, nurmi, s, relationship, with, his, son, was, termed, uneasy, matti, admired, his, father, more, as, a, businessman, than, as, an, athlete, and, the, two, never, discussed, his, running, career, as, a, runner, matti, was, at, his, best, in, the, 3000, m, where, he, equalled, his, father, s, time, in, the, famous, race, on, 11, july, 1957, when, the, three, olavis, salsola, salonen, and, vuorisalo, broke, the, world, record, for, the, 1500, m, matti, nurmi, finished, a, distant, ninth, with, his, personal, best, 2, 2, seconds, slower, than, his, father, s, world, record, from, 1924, hollywood, actress, maila, nurmi, best, known, as, the, horror, icon, vampira, was, often, referred, to, as, paavo, nurmi, s, niece, however, the, kinship, is, not, supported, by, official, documents, nurmi, enjoyed, the, finnish, sports, massage, and, sauna, bathing, traditions, crediting, the, finnish, sauna, for, his, performances, during, the, paris, heat, wave, in, 1924, he, had, a, versatile, diet, although, he, had, practiced, vegetarianism, between, the, ages, of, 15, and, 21, nurmi, who, identified, as, neurasthenic, was, known, to, be, taciturn, stony, faced, and, stubborn, he, was, not, believed, to, have, had, any, close, friends, but, he, had, occasionally, socialized, and, showed, his, sarcastic, sense, of, humour, among, the, small, circles, he, knew, acclaimed, the, biggest, sporting, figure, in, the, world, at, his, peak, nurmi, was, averse, to, publicity, and, the, media, stating, later, on, his, 75th, birthday, orldly, fame, and, reputation, are, worth, less, than, a, rotten, lingonberry, french, journalist, gabriel, hanot, questioned, nurmi, s, intensive, approach, to, sports, and, wrote, in, 1924, that, nurmi, is, ever, more, serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic, there, is, such, coldness, in, him, and, his, self, control, is, so, great, that, never, for, a, moment, does, he, show, his, feelings, some, contemporary, finns, nicknamed, him, suuri, vaikenija, the, great, silent, one, and, ron, clarke, noted, that, nurmi, s, persona, remained, a, mystery, even, to, finnish, runners, and, journalists, even, to, them, he, was, never, quite, real, he, was, enigmatic, sphinx, like, a, god, in, a, cloud, it, was, as, if, he, was, all, the, time, playing, a, role, in, a, drama, nurmi, was, more, responsive, to, his, fellow, athletes, than, to, the, media, he, exchanged, ideas, with, sprinter, charley, paddock, and, even, trained, with, his, rival, otto, peltzer, nurmi, told, peltzer, to, forget, his, opponents, conquering, yourself, is, the, greatest, challenge, of, an, athlete, nurmi, was, known, to, emphasize, the, importance, of, psychological, strength, mind, is, everything, muscle, pieces, of, rubber, all, that, i, am, i, am, because, of, my, mind, regarding, nurmi, s, track, antics, peltzer, found, that, in, his, impenetrability, he, was, a, buddha, gliding, on, the, track, stopwatch, in, hand, lap, after, lap, he, ran, towards, the, tape, subject, only, to, the, laws, of, a, mathematical, table, marathoner, johnny, kelley, who, first, met, his, idol, at, the, 1936, olympics, said, that, while, nurmi, appeared, cold, to, him, at, first, the, two, chatted, for, quite, a, while, after, nurmi, had, asked, for, his, name, he, grabbed, ahold, of, me, he, was, so, excited, i, couldn, t, believe, it, nurmi, s, speed, and, elusive, personality, led, to, nicknames, such, as, the, phantom, finn, the, king, of, runners, and, peerless, paavo, while, his, mathematical, prowess, and, use, of, a, stopwatch, led, the, press, to, characterize, him, as, a, running, machine, one, newspaperman, dubbed, nurmi, a, mechanical, frankenstein, created, to, annihilate, time, phil, cousineau, noted, that, his, own, innovation, the, tactic, of, pacing, himself, with, a, stopwatch, both, inspired, and, troubled, people, in, an, era, when, the, robot, was, becoming, symbolic, of, the, modern, soulless, human, being, among, the, popular, newspaper, rumours, about, nurmi, was, that, he, had, a, freakish, heart, with, a, very, low, pulse, rate, during, the, debate, over, his, amateur, status, nurmi, was, joked, to, have, the, lowest, heartbeat, and, the, highest, asking, price, of, any, athlete, in, the, world, nurmi, broke, 22, official, world, records, on, distances, between, 1500, m, and, 20, km, a, record, in, running, he, also, set, many, more, unofficial, ones, for, a, total, of, 58, his, indoor, world, records, were, all, unofficial, as, the, iaaf, did, not, ratify, indoor, records, until, the, 1980s, nurmi, s, record, for, most, olympic, gold, medals, was, matched, by, gymnast, larisa, latynina, in, 1964, swimmer, mark, spitz, in, 1972, and, fellow, track, and, field, athlete, carl, lewis, in, 1996, and, broken, by, swimmer, michael, phelps, in, 2008, nurmi, s, record, for, most, medals, in, the, olympic, games, stood, until, edoardo, mangiarotti, won, his, 13th, medal, in, fencing, in, 1960, time, selected, nurmi, as, the, greatest, olympian, of, all, time, in, 1996, and, iaaf, named, him, among, the, first, twelve, athletes, to, be, inducted, into, the, iaaf, hall, of, fame, in, 2012, nurmi, introduced, the, even, pace, strategy, to, running, pacing, himself, with, a, stopwatch, and, spreading, his, energy, uniformly, over, the, race, he, reasoned, that, when, you, race, against, time, you, don, t, have, to, sprint, others, can, t, hold, the, pace, if, it, is, steady, and, hard, all, through, to, the, tape, archie, macpherson, stated, that, with, the, stopwatch, always, in, his, hand, he, elevated, athletics, to, a, new, plane, of, intelligent, application, of, effort, and, was, the, harbinger, of, the, modern, scientifically, prepared, athlete, nurmi, was, considered, a, pioneer, also, in, regards, to, training, he, developed, a, systematic, all, year, round, training, program, that, included, both, long, distance, work, and, interval, running, peter, lovesey, wrote, in, the, kings, of, distance, a, study, of, five, great, runners, that, nurmi, accelerated, the, progress, of, world, records, developed, and, actually, came, to, personify, the, analytic, approach, to, running, and, he, was, a, profound, influence, not, only, in, finland, but, throughout, the, world, of, athletics, nurmi, his, style, technique, and, tactics, were, held, to, be, infallible, and, really, seemed, so, as, successive, imitators, in, finland, steadily, improved, the, records, cordner, nelson, founder, of, track, field, news, credited, nurmi, for, popularizing, running, as, a, spectator, sport, his, imprint, on, the, track, world, was, greater, than, any, man, s, before, or, after, he, more, than, any, man, raised, track, to, the, glory, of, a, major, sport, in, the, eyes, of, international, fans, and, they, honored, him, as, one, of, the, truly, great, athletes, of, all,
