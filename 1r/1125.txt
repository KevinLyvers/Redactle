the, event, of, ghadir, khumm, where, according, to, shia, sources, he, was, among, those, who, pledged, allegiance, to, ali, uthman, had, a, very, close, relationship, with, abu, bakr, as, it, was, due, to, him, that, uthman, had, converted, to, islam, when, abu, bakr, was, selected, as, the, caliph, uthman, was, the, first, person, after, umar, to, offer, his, allegiance, during, the, ridda, wars, wars, of, apostasy, uthman, remained, in, medina, acting, as, abu, bakr, s, adviser, on, his, deathbed, abu, bakr, dictated, his, will, to, uthman, saying, that, his, successor, was, to, be, umar, umar, on, his, deathbed, formed, a, committee, of, six, people, to, choose, the, next, caliph, from, amongst, themselves, this, committee, was, according, to, yaqoubi, history, umar, appointed, abu, talha, ansari, to, this, task, and, said, if, four, people, gave, an, opinion, and, two, disagreed, behead, those, two, and, if, three, agreed, and, three, disagreed, the, three, people, whom, abd, al, rahman, is, not, among, them, behead, them, and, if, three, days, passed, and, they, didn, t, reach, an, agreement, on, anyone, behead, them, all, yaqoubi, further, adds, that, many, negotiations, took, place, in, these, three, days, and, the, result, was, hesitant, between, ali, and, uthman, abd, al, rahman, asked, ali, if, we, pledge, allegiance, to, you, would, you, be, willing, to, follow, the, book, of, god, quran, and, the, sunnah, of, the, messenger, of, allah, and, behave, in, the, manner, of, the, two, previous, caliphs, umar, and, abu, bakr, ali, s, answer, to, abd, al, rahman, was, i, will, only, follow, the, book, of, god, and, the, sunnah, of, the, messenger, of, god, abd, al, rahman, asked, the, same, question, to, uthman, and, uthman, answered, positively, and, accepted, all, the, conditions, and, therefore, he, became, the, caliph, in, about, ad, 650, uthman, began, noticing, slight, differences, in, recitations, of, the, quran, as, islam, expanded, beyond, the, arabian, peninsula, into, persia, the, levant, and, north, africa, in, order, to, preserve, the, sanctity, of, the, text, he, ordered, a, committee, headed, by, zayd, ibn, thabit, to, use, caliph, abu, bakr, s, copy, and, prepare, a, standardised, version, of, the, quran, thus, within, 20, years, of, muhammad, s, death, the, quran, was, committed, to, written, form, that, text, became, the, model, from, which, copies, were, made, and, promulgated, throughout, the, urban, centers, of, the, muslim, world, with, the, other, versions, ordered, to, been, burnt, by, uthman, while, the, sh, ah, use, the, same, qur, an, as, sunni, muslims, they, do, not, believe, however, that, it, was, first, compiled, by, uthman, the, sh, ah, believe, that, the, qur, an, was, gathered, and, compiled, by, muhammad, during, his, lifetime, uthman, was, a, shrewd, businessman, and, a, successful, trader, from, his, youth, which, contributed, greatly, to, the, rashidun, caliphate, umar, had, established, a, public, allowance, and, on, assuming, office, uthman, increased, it, by, about, 25, umar, had, placed, a, ban, on, the, sale, of, lands, and, the, purchase, of, agricultural, lands, in, conquered, territories, uthman, withdrew, these, restrictions, in, view, of, the, fact, that, the, trade, could, not, flourish, uthman, also, permitted, people, to, draw, loans, from, the, public, treasury, under, umar, it, had, been, laid, down, as, a, policy, that, the, lands, in, conquered, territories, were, not, to, be, distributed, among, the, combatants, but, were, to, remain, the, property, of, the, previous, owners, the, army, felt, dissatisfied, at, this, decision, but, umar, suppressed, the, opposition, with, a, strong, hand, uthman, followed, the, policy, devised, by, umar, and, there, were, more, conquests, and, the, revenues, from, land, increased, considerably, umar, had, been, very, strict, in, the, use, of, money, from, the, public, treasury, indeed, apart, from, the, meagre, allowance, that, had, been, sanctioned, in, his, favour, umar, took, no, money, from, the, treasury, he, did, not, receive, any, gifts, nor, did, he, allow, any, of, his, family, members, to, accept, any, gifts, from, any, quarter, during, the, time, of, uthman, these, restrictions, were, relaxed, although, uthman, still, drew, no, personal, allowance, from, the, treasury, nor, did, he, receive, a, salary, as, he, was, a, wealthy, man, with, sufficient, resources, of, his, own, but, unlike, umar, uthman, accepted, gifts, and, allowed, his, family, members, to, do, likewise, from, certain, quarters, uthman, honestly, expressed, that, he, had, the, right, to, utilize, the, public, funds, according, to, his, best, judgment, and, no, one, criticized, him, for, that, the, economic, reforms, introduced, by, uthman, had, far, reaching, effects, muslims, as, well, as, non, muslims, of, the, rashidun, empire, enjoyed, an, economically, prosperous, life, during, his, reign, byzantine, empire, sassanid, persia, caucasus, other, regions, the, levant, egypt, north, africa, anatolia, constantinople, border, conflicts, sicily, and, southern, italy, naval, warfare, byzantine, reconquest, khuzestan, central, persia, caucasus, pars, khorasan, other, geographies, during, his, rule, uthman, s, military, style, was, more, autonomical, in, nature, as, he, delegated, much, military, authority, to, his, trusted, kinsmen, e, g, abd, allah, ibn, amir, mu, awiya, i, and, abd, allah, ibn, sa, d, unlike, umar, s, more, centralized, policy, consequently, this, more, independent, policy, allowed, more, expansion, until, sindh, in, modern, pakistan, which, had, not, been, touched, during, the, tenure, of, umar, the, conquest, of, armenia, had, begun, by, the, 640s, muawiyah, i, had, been, appointed, the, governor, of, syria, by, umar, in, 639, to, stop, byzantine, harassment, from, the, sea, during, the, arab, byzantine, wars, he, succeeded, his, elder, brother, yazid, ibn, abi, sufyan, who, died, in, a, plague, along, with, abu, ubaidah, ibn, al, jarrah, the, governor, before, him, and, 25, 000, other, people, now, under, uthman, s, rule, in, 649, muawiyah, was, allowed, to, set, up, a, navy, manned, by, monophysitic, christians, copts, and, jacobite, syrian, christian, sailors, and, muslim, troops, which, defeated, the, byzantine, navy, at, the, battle, of, the, masts, in, 655, opening, up, the, mediterranean, in, hijri, year, 15, c, 647, uthman, sent, abdullah, ibn, zubayr, and, abdullah, ibn, saad, to, reconquer, the, maghreb, where, he, met, the, army, of, gregory, the, patrician, exarch, of, africa, and, relative, of, heraclius, which, is, recorded, to, have, numbered, between, 120, 000, and, 200, 000, soldiers, although, another, estimate, was, recorded, gregory, s, army, was, put, at, 20, 000, the, opposing, forces, clashed, at, sabuthilag, or, sufetula, which, became, the, name, of, this, battle, records, from, al, bidayah, wal, nihayah, state, that, abdullah, s, troops, were, completely, surrounded, by, gregory, s, army, however, abdullah, ibn, zubayr, spotted, gregory, in, his, chariot, and, asked, abdullah, ibn, sa, ad, to, lead, a, small, detachment, to, intercept, him, the, interception, was, successful, and, gregory, was, slain, by, zubayr, s, ambush, party, consequently, the, morale, of, byzantine, army, started, crumbling, and, soon, they, were, routed, some, muslim, sources, muhammad, ibn, jarir, al, tabari, claim, that, after, the, conquest, of, northern, africa, was, completed, abdullah, ibn, sa, d, continued, to, spain, other, prominent, muslim, historians, like, ibn, kathir, have, quoted, the, same, narration, in, the, description, of, this, campaign, two, of, abdullah, ibn, saad, s, generals, abdullah, ibn, nafiah, ibn, husain, and, abdullah, ibn, nafi, ibn, abdul, qais, were, ordered, to, invade, the, coastal, areas, of, spain, by, sea, aided, by, a, berber, force, they, allegedly, succeeded, in, conquering, the, coastal, areas, of, al, andalus, it, is, not, known, where, the, muslim, force, landed, what, resistance, they, met, and, what, parts, of, spain, they, actually, conquered, however, it, is, clear, that, the, muslims, did, conquer, some, portion, of, spain, during, the, caliphate, of, uthman, presumably, establishing, colonies, on, its, coast, on, this, occasion, uthman, is, reported, to, have, addressed, a, letter, to, the, invading, force, constantinople, will, be, conquered, from, the, side, of, al, andalus, thus, if, you, conquer, it, you, will, have, the, honor, of, taking, the, first, step, towards, the, conquest, of, constantinople, you, will, have, your, reward, in, this, behalf, both, in, this, world, and, the, next, although, raids, by, berbers, and, muslims, were, conducted, against, the, visigothic, kingdom, in, spain, during, the, late, 7th, century, there, is, no, evidence, that, spain, was, invaded, nor, that, parts, of, it, were, conquered, or, settled, by, muslims, prior, to, the, 711, campaign, by, tariq, abdullah, ibn, saad, also, achieved, success, in, the, caliphate, s, first, decisive, naval, battle, against, the, byzantine, empire, the, battle, of, the, masts, to, the, east, ahnaf, ibn, qais, chief, of, banu, tamim, and, a, veteran, commander, who, conquered, shustar, earlier, launched, a, series, of, further, military, expansions, by, further, mauling, yazdegerd, iii, near, oxus, river, in, turkmenistan, and, later, crushing, a, military, coalition, of, sassanid, loyalists, and, hephthalite, empire, in, the, siege, of, herat, later, the, governor, of, basra, abdullah, ibn, aamir, also, led, a, number, of, successful, campaigns, ranging, from, the, suppression, of, revolts, in, fars, kerman, sistan, and, khorasan, to, the, opening, of, new, fronts, for, conquest, in, transoxiana, and, afghanistan, in, the, next, year, ad, 652, futh, al, buldan, of, baladhuri, writes, that, balochistan, was, re, conquered, during, the, campaign, against, the, revolt, in, kerm, n, under, the, command, of, majasha, ibn, mas, ud, it, was, the, first, time, that, western, balochistan, had, come, directly, under, the, laws, of, the, caliphate, and, it, paid, an, agricultural, tribute, the, military, campaigns, under, uthman, s, rule, were, generally, successful, except, for, a, few, in, the, kingdom, of, nubia, on, the, lower, nile, noting, an, increase, in, anti, government, tension, around, the, caliphate, uthman, s, administration, decided, to, determine, its, origins, extent, and, aims, some, time, around, 654, uthman, called, all, twelve, provincial, governors, to, medina, to, discuss, the, problem, during, this, council, of, governors, uthman, ordered, that, all, resolutions, of, the, council, be, adopted, according, to, local, circumstances, later, in, the, majlis, al, shurah, council, of, ministers, it, was, suggested, to, uthman, that, reliable, agents, be, sent, to, various, provinces, to, attempt, to, determine, the, source, of, the, discontent, uthman, accordingly, sent, muhammad, ibn, maslamah, to, kufa, usama, ibn, zayd, to, basra, ammar, ibn, yasir, to, egypt, and, abdullah, ibn, umar, to, syria, the, agents, sent, to, kufa, basra, and, syria, reported, that, all, was, well, the, people, were, generally, satisfied, with, the, administration, although, some, individuals, had, minor, personal, grievances, ammar, ibn, yasir, the, emissary, to, egypt, however, did, not, return, to, medina, rebels, there, had, been, issuing, propaganda, in, favour, of, making, ali, caliph, ammar, ibn, yasir, who, had, been, affiliated, with, ali, abandoned, uthman, for, the, egyptian, opposition, abdullah, ibn, saad, the, governor, of, egypt, reported, about, the, opposition, s, activities, instead, he, wanted, to, take, action, against, ali, s, foster, son, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, muhammad, bin, abi, hudhaifa, uthman, s, adopted, son, and, ammar, ibn, yasir, in, 655, uthman, directed, those, with, any, grievance, against, the, administration, as, well, as, the, governors, and, amils, throughout, the, caliphate, to, assemble, at, mecca, for, the, hajj, promising, that, all, legitimate, grievances, would, be, redressed, accordingly, large, delegations, from, various, cities, came, to, present, their, grievances, before, the, gathering, the, rebels, realized, that, the, people, in, mecca, supported, uthman, and, were, not, inclined, to, listen, to, them, this, represented, a, great, psychological, victory, for, uthman, it, is, said, according, to, sunni, muslim, accounts, that, before, returning, to, syria, the, governor, muawiyah, uthman, s, cousin, suggested, that, uthman, should, come, with, him, to, syria, as, the, atmosphere, there, was, peaceful, uthman, rejected, his, offer, saying, that, he, did, not, want, to, leave, the, city, of, muhammad, viz, medina, muawiyah, then, suggested, that, he, be, allowed, to, send, a, strong, force, from, syria, to, medina, to, guard, uthman, against, any, possible, attempt, by, rebels, to, harm, him, uthman, rejected, it, too, saying, that, the, syrian, forces, in, medina, would, be, an, incitement, to, civil, war, and, he, could, not, be, party, to, such, a, move, the, politics, of, egypt, played, the, major, role, in, the, propaganda, war, against, the, caliphate, so, uthman, summoned, abdullah, ibn, saad, the, governor, of, egypt, to, medina, to, consult, with, him, as, to, the, course, of, action, that, should, be, adopted, abdullah, ibn, saad, came, to, medina, leaving, the, affairs, of, egypt, to, his, deputy, and, in, his, absence, muhammad, bin, abi, hudhaifa, staged, a, coup, d, tat, and, took, power, on, hearing, of, the, revolt, in, egypt, abdullah, hastened, back, but, uthman, was, not, in, a, position, to, offer, him, any, military, assistance, and, so, abdullah, was, unable, to, suppress, the, revolt, several, sunni, scholars, such, as, ibn, qutaybah, ali, ibn, burhanuddin, al, halabi, ibne, abi, al, hadeed, and, ibne, manzur, reported, that, there, were, several, leading, sahaba, among, those, who, called, upon, uthman, to, step, down, for, reasons, such, as, nepotism, and, profligacy, from, egypt, kufa, and, basra, contingents, of, about, 1, 000, people, apiece, were, sent, to, medina, each, with, instructions, to, assassinate, uthman, and, overthrow, the, government, representatives, of, the, egyptian, contingent, waited, on, ali, and, offered, him, the, caliphate, but, he, turned, them, down, representatives, of, the, contingent, from, kufa, waited, on, al, zubayr, and, those, from, basra, waited, on, talha, each, offering, them, their, allegiance, as, the, next, caliph, but, both, were, similarly, turned, down, by, proposing, alternatives, to, uthman, as, caliph, the, rebels, swayed, public, opinion, in, medina, to, the, point, where, uthman, s, faction, could, no, longer, offer, a, united, front, uthman, had, the, active, support, of, the, umayyads, and, a, few, other, people, in, medina, the, early, stage, of, the, siege, of, uthman, s, house, was, not, severe, but, as, the, days, passed, the, rebels, intensified, the, pressure, against, uthman, with, the, departure, of, the, pilgrims, from, medina, to, mecca, the, rebel, position, was, strengthened, further, and, as, a, consequence, the, crisis, deepened, the, rebels, understood, that, after, the, hajj, the, muslims, gathered, at, mecca, from, all, parts, of, the, muslim, world, might, march, to, medina, to, relieve, uthman, they, therefore, decided, to, take, action, against, uthman, before, the, pilgrimage, was, over, during, the, siege, uthman, was, asked, by, his, supporters, who, outnumbered, the, rebels, to, let, them, fight, but, uthman, refused, in, an, effort, to, avoid, bloodshed, among, muslims, unfortunately, for, uthman, violence, still, occurred, the, gates, of, the, house, of, uthman, were, shut, and, guarded, by, the, renowned, warrior, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, along, with, ali, s, sons, hasan, ibn, ali, and, husayn, ibn, ali, the, actual, reason, for, the, anti, uthman, movement, is, disputed, among, the, shia, and, sunni, muslims, under, uthman, the, people, became, more, prosperous, and, on, the, political, plane, they, came, to, enjoy, a, larger, degree, of, freedom, no, institutions, were, devised, to, channel, political, activity, and, in, their, absence, the, pre, islamic, tribal, jealousies, and, rivalries, which, had, been, suppressed, under, earlier, caliphs, erupted, once, again, the, people, took, advantage, of, uthman, s, leniency, which, became, a, headache, for, the, state, culminating, in, uthman, s, assassination, according, to, wilferd, madelung, during, uthman, s, reign, grievances, against, his, arbitrary, acts, were, substantial, by, standards, of, his, time, historical, sources, mention, a, lengthy, account, of, the, wrongdoings, he, was, accused, of, it, was, only, his, violent, death, that, came, to, absolve, him, in, sunni, ideology, from, any, ahdath, and, make, him, a, martyr, and, the, third, rightly, guided, caliph, according, to, keaney, heather, uthman, as, a, caliph, relied, solely, on, his, own, volition, in, picking, his, cabinet, which, led, to, decisions, that, bred, resistance, within, the, muslim, community, indeed, his, style, of, governance, made, uthman, one, of, the, most, controversial, figures, in, islamic, history, the, resistance, against, uthman, arose, because, he, favoured, family, members, when, choosing, governors, reasoning, that, by, doing, this, he, would, be, able, to, exact, more, influence, on, how, the, caliphate, was, run, and, consequently, improve, the, feudal, system, he, worked, to, establish, the, contrary, turned, out, to, be, true, and, his, appointees, had, more, control, over, how, he, conducted, business, than, he, had, originally, planned, they, went, so, far, as, to, impose, authoritarianism, over, their, provinces, indeed, many, anonymous, letters, were, written, to, the, leading, companions, of, muhammad, complaining, about, the, alleged, tyranny, of, uthman, s, appointed, governors, moreover, letters, were, sent, to, the, leaders, of, public, opinion, in, different, provinces, concerning, the, reported, mishandling, of, power, by, uthman, s, family, this, contributed, to, unrest, in, the, empire, and, finally, uthman, had, to, investigate, the, matter, in, an, attempt, to, ascertain, the, authenticity, of, the, rumours, wilferd, madelung, discredits, the, alleged, role, of, abdullah, ibn, saba, in, the, rebellion, against, uthman, and, observes, that, few, if, any, modern, historians, would, accept, sayf, s, legend, of, ibn, saba, bernard, lewis, a, 20th, century, scholar, says, of, uthman, uthman, like, mu, awiya, was, a, member, of, the, leading, meccan, family, of, ummaya, and, was, indeed, the, sole, representative, of, the, meccan, patricians, among, the, early, companions, of, the, prophet, with, sufficient, prestige, to, rank, as, a, candidate, his, election, was, at, once, their, victory, and, their, opportunity, that, opportunity, was, not, neglected, uthman, soon, fell, under, the, influence, of, the, dominant, meccan, families, and, one, after, another, the, high, posts, of, the, empire, went, to, members, of, those, families, the, weakness, and, nepotism, of, uthman, brought, to, a, head, the, resentment, which, had, for, some, time, been, stirring, obscurely, among, the, arab, warriors, the, muslim, tradition, attribute, the, breakdown, which, occurred, during, his, reign, to, the, personal, defects, of, uthman, but, the, causes, lie, far, deeper, and, the, guilt, of, uthman, lay, in, his, failure, to, recognize, control, or, remedy, them, on, 17, june, 656, rebels, found, the, gate, of, uthman, s, house, strongly, guarded, by, his, supporters, some, of, the, rebels, scaled, the, neighboring, houses, and, jumped, into, uthman, s, then, one, rebel, approached, uthman, grabbed, and, shook, his, beard, uthman, prayed, to, god, for, protection, from, killing, the, rebel, stabbed, him, in, the, head, and, the, other, rebels, followed, suit, according, to, a, narration, regarded, as, likely, to, be, a, legend, by, madelung, uthman, s, wives, threw, themselves, on, his, body, to, shield, him, na, ila, one, of, his, wives, extended, her, hand, to, block, a, blade, her, fingers, were, severed, and, she, was, shoved, aside, the, following, strike, killed, uthman, a, few, of, uthman, s, slaves, retaliated, and, one, of, them, succeeded, in, killing, one, of, the, assassins, before, being, murdered, by, the, rebels, after, the, body, of, uthman, had, been, in, the, house, for, three, days, naila, approached, some, of, his, supporters, to, assist, in, his, burial, but, only, about, a, dozen, people, responded, including, marwan, zayd, ibn, thabit, huwatib, bin, alfarah, jubayr, ibn, mut, im, abu, jahm, bin, hudaifa, hakim, bin, hazam, and, niyar, bin, mukarram, the, body, was, lifted, at, dusk, and, because, of, the, blockade, no, coffin, could, be, procured, the, body, was, not, washed, thus, uthman, was, carried, to, the, graveyard, in, the, clothes, that, he, was, wearing, at, the, time, of, his, assassination, naila, followed, the, funeral, with, a, lamp, but, in, order, to, maintain, secrecy, the, lamp, had, to, be, extinguished, naila, was, accompanied, by, some, women, including, uthman, s, daughter, 247, 248, the, body, was, carried, to, jannat, al, baqi, for, burial, apparently, some, people, gathered, there, and, resisted, uthman, s, burial, in, the, muslim, cemetery, accordingly, uthman, s, supporters, later, buried, him, in, the, jewish, graveyard, behind, jannat, al, baqi, some, decades, later, the, umayyad, rulers, demolished, the, wall, separating, the, two, cemeteries, and, merged, the, jewish, cemetery, into, the, muslim, one, to, ensure, that, his, tomb, was, now, inside, a, muslim, cemetery, the, funeral, prayers, were, led, by, jubayr, ibn, mut, im, and, the, dead, body, was, lowered, into, the, grave, with, little, ceremony, after, burial, na, ila, and, a, isha, wanted, to, speak, but, were, discouraged, from, doing, so, due, to, possible, danger, from, the, rioters, 247, the, historian, al, tabari, notes, that, uthman, was, of, medium, height, strong, boned, and, broad, shouldered, and, walked, in, a, bowlegged, manner, he, is, said, to, have, had, large, limbs, with, fleshy, shins, and, long, hairy, forearms, though, commonly, described, as, having, been, very, handsome, with, a, fair, complexion, when, viewed, up, close, light, scars, from, a, childhood, bout, of, smallpox, were, said, to, have, been, evident, on, his, face, he, had, a, full, reddish, brown, beard, to, which, he, applied, saffron, and, thick, curly, hair, which, grew, past, his, ears, though, receded, at, the, front, his, teeth, were, bound, with, gold, wire, with, the, front, ones, being, noted, as, being, particularly, fine, unlike, his, predecessor, umar, uthman, was, not, a, skilled, orator, having, grown, tongue, tied, during, his, first, address, as, caliph, he, remained, somewhat, apart, from, the, other, close, sahaba, having, been, an, elegant, educated, and, cultured, merchant, prince, standing, out, among, his, poorer, compatriots, this, was, a, trait, which, had, been, acknowledged, by, muhammad, one, story, relates, that, aisha, having, noted, that, muhammad, reclined, comfortably, and, spoke, casually, with, abu, bakr, and, umar, asked, him, why, when, he, addressed, uthman, he, chose, to, gather, his, clothing, neatly, and, assume, a, formal, manner, muhammad, replied, that, uthman, is, modest, and, shy, and, if, l, had, been, informal, with, him, he, would, not, have, said, what, he, had, come, here, to, say, uthman, was, a, family, man, who, led, a, simple, life, even, after, becoming, the, caliph, despite, the, fact, that, his, flourishing, family, business, had, made, him, rich, prior, caliphs, had, been, paid, for, their, services, from, the, bayt, al, mal, the, public, treasury, but, the, independently, wealthy, uthman, never, took, a, salary, uthman, was, also, a, humanitarian, he, customarily, freed, slaves, every, friday, looked, after, the, widows, and, orphans, and, gave, unlimited, charity, his, patience, and, endurance, were, among, the, characteristics, that, made, him, a, successful, leader, as, a, way, of, taking, care, of, muhammad, s, wives, he, doubled, their, allowances, uthman, was, not, completely, plain, and, simple, however, he, built, a, palace, for, himself, in, medina, known, as, al, zawar, with, a, notable, feature, being, doors, of, precious, wood, although, uthman, paid, for, the, palace, with, his, own, money, shia, muslims, considered, it, his, first, step, towards, ruling, like, a, king, it, was, asked, of, uthman, why, he, did, not, drink, wine, during, the, age, of, ignorance, when, there, was, no, objection, to, this, practice, before, the, revelation, of, islam, he, replied, i, saw, that, it, made, the, intellect, flee, in, its, entirety, and, i, ve, never, known, of, something, to, do, this, and, then, return, in, its, entirety, uthman, is, said, to, have, been, the, first, caliph, to, adopt, the, title, khalifat, allah, deputy, of, god, the, general, opinion, of, the, sunni, muslim, community, and, sunni, historians, regarding, uthman, s, rule, were, positive, particularly, regarding, his, leniency, in, their, view, the, kinsmen, he, appointed, such, as, muawiya, and, abdullah, ibn, aamir, proved, to, be, effective, in, both, military, and, political, management, historians, like, zaki, muhammad, accused, uthman, of, corruption, particularly, in, the, case, of, waleed, ibn, uqba, perhaps, the, most, significant, act, of, uthman, was, allowing, muawiya, and, abdullah, ibn, saad, governors, respectively, of, syria, and, northern, africa, to, form, the, first, integrated, muslim, navy, in, the, mediterranean, sea, rivalling, the, maritime, domination, of, the, byzantine, empire, ibn, saad, s, conquest, of, the, southeast, coast, of, spain, his, stunning, victory, at, the, battle, of, the, masts, in, lycia, and, expansion, to, other, coasts, of, the, mediterranean, sea, are, generally, overlooked, these, achievements, gave, birth, to, the, first, muslim, standing, navy, thus, enabling, the, first, muslim, maritime, conquest, of, cyprus, and, rhodes, this, subsequently, paved, the, way, for, the, establishment, of, several, muslim, states, in, the, mediterranean, sea, during, the, later, umayyad, and, abbasid, eras, which, came, in, the, form, of, the, emirate, of, sicily, and, its, minor, vassal, the, emirate, of, bari, as, well, as, the, emirate, of, crete, and, the, aglabid, dynasty, the, significance, of, uthman, s, naval, development, and, its, political, legacy, was, agreed, upon, by, muhammad, m, ag, author, of, islamic, fiscal, and, monetary, policy, and, further, strengthened, by, hassan, khalileh, referencing, tarikh, al, bahriyya, wal, islamiyya, fii, misr, wal, sham, history, of, the, seas, and, islam, in, egypt, and, levant, by, ahmad, abaddy, and, esayyed, salem, from, an, expansionist, perspective, uthman, is, regarded, as, skilled, in, conflict, management, as, is, evident, from, how, he, dealt, with, the, heated, and, troubled, early, muslim, conquered, territories, such, as, kufa, and, basra, by, directing, the, hot, headed, arab, settlers, to, new, military, campaigns, and, expansions, this, not, only, resulted, in, settling, the, internal, conflicts, in, those, settlements, but, also, further, expanded, rashidun, territory, to, as, far, west, as, southern, iberia, and, as, far, east, as, sindh, pakistan, lasting, religious, impact, uthman, is, credited, with, bringing, unity, to, the, current, version, of, the, quran, prior, to, uthman, s, reign, the, qur, an, did, not, formally, exist, as, a, fixed, text, but, was, written, in, fragmentary, form, and, as, a, spoken, recited, work, uthman, observed, this, brought, with, it, some, challenges, for, example, even, men, of, the, same, tribe, would, at, times, disagree, over, how, the, quran, would, be, recited, although, some, of, the, companions, of, mohammed, had, attempted, to, bring, together, collections, of, the, quran, it, had, not, yet, been, standardized, anas, bin, malik, reported, hudhaifa, was, afraid, of, their, the, people, of, sham, and, iraq, differences, in, the, recitation, of, the, qur, an, so, he, said, to, uthman, o, chief, of, the, believers, save, this, nation, before, they, differ, about, the, book, so, uthman, sent, a, message, to, hafsa, saying, send, us, the, manuscripts, of, the, qur, an, so, that, we, may, compile, the, qur, anic, materials, in, perfect, copies, and, return, the, manuscripts, to, you, hafsa, sent, it, to, uthman, uthman, then, ordered, zaid, bin, thabit, abdullah, bin, azzubair, sa, id, bin, al, as, and, abdurrahman, bin, harith, bin, hisham, to, rewrite, the, manuscripts, this, caliphate, order, made, by, uthman, gave, the, final, form, of, the, quran, we, have, today, and, although, a, few, small, variants, do, exist, in, some, areas, most, of, the, variant, readings, and, recitations, have, been, lost, or, destroyed, media, related, to, uthman, at, wikimedia, commons, views, of, various, islamic, historians, on, uthman, views, of, the, arab, media, on, uthman, shia, view, of, uthman
