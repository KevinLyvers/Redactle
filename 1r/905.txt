so, j, y, daishi, and, bussh, dent, kokushi, originally, ordained, as, a, monk, in, the, tendai, school, in, kyoto, he, was, ultimately, dissatisfied, with, its, teaching, and, traveled, to, china, to, seek, out, what, he, believed, to, be, a, more, authentic, buddhism, he, remained, there, for, four, years, finally, training, under, ti, nt, ng, r, j, ng, an, eminent, teacher, of, the, c, od, ng, lineage, of, chinese, chan, upon, his, return, to, japan, he, began, promoting, the, practice, of, zazen, sitting, meditation, through, literary, works, such, as, fukanzazengi, and, bend, wa, he, eventually, broke, relations, completely, with, the, powerful, tendai, school, and, after, several, years, of, likely, friction, between, himself, and, the, establishment, left, kyoto, for, the, mountainous, countryside, where, he, founded, the, monastery, eihei, ji, which, remains, the, head, temple, of, the, s, t, school, today, d, gen, is, known, for, his, extensive, writings, like, the, sh, b, genz, treasury, of, the, true, dharma, eye, considered, his, magnum, opus, the, eihei, k, roku, extensive, record, a, collection, of, his, talks, the, eihei, shingi, the, first, japanese, zen, monastic, code, along, with, his, japanese, poetry, and, commentaries, d, gen, s, writings, are, one, of, the, most, important, sources, studied, in, the, contemporary, s, t, zen, tradition, d, gen, was, probably, born, into, a, noble, family, though, as, an, illegitimate, child, of, minamoto, michichika, his, foster, father, was, his, older, brother, minamoto, no, michitomo, who, served, in, the, imperial, court, as, a, high, ranking, ash, councillor, of, state, his, mother, named, ishi, the, daughter, of, matsudono, motofusa, and, a, sister, of, the, monk, ry, kan, h, gen, is, said, to, have, died, when, d, gen, was, age, 7, in, 1212, the, spring, of, his, thirteenth, year, d, gen, fled, the, house, of, his, uncle, matsudono, moroie, and, went, to, his, uncle, ry, kan, h, gen, at, the, foot, of, mount, hiei, the, headquarters, of, the, tendai, school, of, buddhism, stating, that, his, mother, s, death, was, the, reason, he, wanted, to, become, a, monk, ry, kan, sent, the, young, d, gen, to, jien, an, abbot, at, yokawa, on, mount, hiei, according, to, the, kenzeiki, he, became, possessed, by, a, single, question, with, regard, to, the, tendai, doctrine, as, i, study, both, the, exoteric, and, the, esoteric, schools, of, buddhism, they, maintain, that, human, beings, are, endowed, with, dharma, nature, by, birth, if, this, is, the, case, why, did, the, buddhas, of, all, ages, undoubtedly, in, possession, of, enlightenment, find, it, necessary, to, seek, enlightenment, and, engage, in, spiritual, practice, this, question, was, in, large, part, prompted, by, the, tendai, concept, of, original, enlightenment, hongaku, which, states, that, all, human, beings, are, enlightened, by, nature, and, that, consequently, any, notion, of, achieving, enlightenment, through, practice, is, fundamentally, flawed, the, kenzeiki, further, states, that, he, found, no, answer, to, his, question, at, mount, hiei, and, that, he, was, disillusioned, by, the, internal, politics, and, need, for, social, prominence, for, advancement, therefore, d, gen, left, to, seek, an, answer, from, other, buddhist, masters, he, went, to, visit, k, in, the, tendai, abbot, of, onj, ji, temple, asking, him, this, same, question, k, in, said, that, in, order, to, find, an, answer, he, might, want, to, consider, studying, ch, n, in, china, in, 1217, two, years, after, the, death, of, contemporary, zen, buddhist, my, an, eisai, d, gen, went, to, study, at, kennin, ji, temple, under, eisai, s, successor, my, zen, in, 1223, d, gen, and, my, zen, undertook, the, dangerous, passage, across, the, east, china, sea, to, china, song, dynasty, to, study, in, jing, de, si, ching, te, ssu, monastery, as, eisai, had, once, done, around, the, time, the, mongol, empire, was, waging, wars, on, the, various, dynasties, of, china, in, china, d, gen, first, went, to, the, leading, chan, monasteries, in, zh, ji, ng, province, at, the, time, most, chan, teachers, based, their, training, around, the, use, of, g, ng, n, japanese, k, an, though, d, gen, assiduously, studied, the, k, ans, he, became, disenchanted, with, the, heavy, emphasis, laid, upon, them, and, wondered, why, the, sutras, were, not, studied, more, at, one, point, owing, to, this, disenchantment, d, gen, even, refused, dharma, transmission, from, a, teacher, then, in, 1225, he, decided, to, visit, a, master, named, r, j, ng, j, nyoj, the, thirteenth, patriarch, of, the, c, od, ng, j, s, t, lineage, of, zen, buddhism, at, mount, ti, nt, ng, s, ti, nt, ngsh, n, j, tend, zan, ti, nt, ng, temple, in, n, ngb, rujing, was, reputed, to, have, a, style, of, chan, that, was, different, from, the, other, masters, whom, d, gen, had, thus, far, encountered, in, later, writings, d, gen, referred, to, rujing, as, the, old, buddha, additionally, he, affectionately, described, both, rujing, and, my, zen, as, senshi, ancient, teacher, under, rujing, d, gen, realized, liberation, of, body, and, mind, upon, hearing, the, master, say, cast, off, body, and, mind, sh, n, x, n, tu, lu, this, phrase, would, continue, to, have, great, importance, to, d, gen, throughout, his, life, and, can, be, found, scattered, throughout, his, writings, as, for, example, in, a, famous, section, of, his, genj, k, an, to, study, the, way, is, to, study, the, self, to, study, the, self, is, to, forget, the, self, to, forget, the, self, is, to, be, enlightened, by, all, things, of, the, universe, to, be, enlightened, by, all, things, of, the, universe, is, to, cast, off, the, body, and, mind, of, the, self, as, well, as, those, of, others, even, the, traces, of, enlightenment, are, wiped, out, and, life, with, traceless, enlightenment, goes, on, forever, and, ever, my, zen, died, shortly, after, d, gen, arrived, at, mount, tiantong, in, 1227, d, gen, received, dharma, transmission, and, inka, from, rujing, and, remarked, on, how, he, had, finally, settled, his, life, s, quest, of, the, great, matter, d, gen, returned, to, japan, in, 1227, or, 1228, going, back, to, stay, at, kennin, ji, where, he, had, trained, previously, among, his, first, actions, upon, returning, was, to, write, down, the, fukanzazengi, universally, recommended, instructions, for, zazen, a, short, text, emphasizing, the, importance, of, and, giving, instructions, for, zazen, sitting, meditation, however, tension, soon, arose, as, the, tendai, community, began, taking, steps, to, suppress, both, zen, and, j, do, shinsh, the, new, forms, of, buddhism, in, japan, in, the, face, of, this, tension, d, gen, left, the, tendai, dominion, of, ky, to, in, 1230, settling, instead, in, an, abandoned, temple, in, what, is, today, the, city, of, uji, south, of, ky, to, in, 1233, d, gen, founded, the, kannon, d, ri, in, in, fukakusa, as, a, small, center, of, practice, he, later, expanded, this, temple, into, k, sh, h, rin, ji, in, 1243, hatano, yoshishige, offered, to, relocate, d, gen, s, community, to, echizen, province, far, to, the, north, of, ky, to, d, gen, accepted, because, of, the, ongoing, tension, with, the, tendai, community, and, the, growing, competition, of, the, rinzai, school, his, followers, built, a, comprehensive, center, of, practice, there, calling, it, daibutsu, temple, daibutsu, ji, while, the, construction, work, was, going, on, d, gen, would, live, and, teach, at, yoshimine, dera, temple, kipp, ji, which, is, located, close, to, daibutsu, ji, during, his, stay, at, kipp, ji, d, gen, fell, into, a, depression, it, marked, a, turning, point, in, his, life, giving, way, to, rigorous, critique, of, rinzai, zen, he, criticized, dahui, zonggao, the, most, influential, figure, of, song, dynasty, ch, n, in, 1246, d, gen, renamed, daibutsu, ji, calling, it, eihei, ji, this, temple, remains, one, of, the, two, head, temples, of, s, t, zen, in, japan, today, the, other, being, s, ji, ji, d, gen, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, teaching, and, writing, at, eihei, ji, in, 1247, the, newly, installed, sh, gun, s, regent, h, j, tokiyori, invited, d, gen, to, come, to, kamakura, to, teach, him, d, gen, made, the, rather, long, journey, east, to, provide, the, sh, gun, with, lay, ordination, and, then, returned, to, eihei, ji, in, 1248, in, the, autumn, of, 1252, d, gen, fell, ill, and, soon, showed, no, signs, of, recovering, he, presented, his, robes, to, his, main, apprentice, koun, ej, making, him, the, abbot, of, eihei, ji, at, hatano, yoshishige, s, invitation, d, gen, left, for, ky, to, in, search, of, a, remedy, for, his, illness, in, 1253, soon, after, arriving, in, ky, to, d, gen, died, shortly, before, his, death, he, had, written, a, death, poem, fifty, four, years, lighting, up, the, sky, a, quivering, leap, smashes, a, billion, worlds, hah, entire, body, looks, for, nothing, living, i, plunge, into, yellow, springs, d, gen, often, stressed, the, critical, importance, of, zazen, or, sitting, meditation, as, the, central, practice, of, buddhism, he, considered, zazen, to, be, identical, to, studying, zen, this, is, pointed, out, clearly, in, the, first, sentence, of, the, 1243, instruction, manual, zazen, gi, principles, of, zazen, studying, zen, is, zazen, d, gen, taught, zazen, to, everyone, even, for, the, laity, male, or, female, and, including, all, social, classes, in, referring, to, zazen, d, gen, is, most, often, referring, specifically, to, shikantaza, roughly, translatable, as, nothing, but, precisely, sitting, or, just, sitting, which, is, a, kind, of, sitting, meditation, in, which, the, meditator, sits, in, a, state, of, brightly, alert, attention, that, is, free, of, thoughts, directed, to, no, object, and, attached, to, no, particular, content, in, his, fukan, zazengi, d, gen, wrote, for, zazen, a, quiet, room, is, suitable, eat, and, drink, moderately, cast, aside, all, involvements, and, cease, all, affairs, do, not, think, good, or, bad, do, not, administer, pros, and, cons, cease, all, the, movements, of, the, conscious, mind, the, gauging, of, all, thoughts, and, views, have, no, designs, on, becoming, a, buddha, zazen, has, nothing, whatever, to, do, with, sitting, or, lying, down, d, gen, also, described, zazen, practice, with, the, term, hishiry, non, thinking, without, thinking, beyond, thinking, according, to, cleary, it, refers, to, ek, hensh, turning, the, light, around, focussing, awareness, on, awareness, itself, it, is, a, state, of, no, mind, which, one, is, simply, aware, of, things, as, they, are, beyond, thinking, and, not, thinking, the, active, effort, not, to, think, in, the, fukanzazengi, d, gen, writes, settle, into, a, steady, immobile, sitting, position, think, of, not, thinking, fushiry, how, do, you, think, of, not, thinking, without, thinking, hishiry, this, in, itself, is, the, essential, art, of, zazen, the, zazen, i, speak, of, is, not, learning, meditation, it, is, simply, the, dharma, gate, of, repose, and, bliss, the, cultivation, authentication, of, totally, culminated, enlightenment, it, is, the, presence, of, things, as, they, are, masanobu, takahashi, writes, that, hishiry, is, not, a, state, of, no, mental, activity, whatsoever, instead, it, is, a, state, beyond, thinking, and, not, thinking, and, beyond, affirmation, and, rejection, other, japanese, dogen, scholars, link, the, term, with, the, realization, of, emptiness, according, to, thomas, kasulis, non, thinking, refers, to, the, pure, presence, of, things, as, they, are, without, affirming, nor, negating, without, accepting, nor, rejecting, without, believing, nor, disbelieving, in, short, it, is, a, non, conceptual, non, intentional, and, prereflective, mode, of, consciousness, which, does, not, imply, that, it, is, an, experience, without, content, similarly, hee, jin, kim, describes, this, as, an, objectless, subjectless, formless, goalless, and, purposeless, state, which, is, yet, not, a, blank, void, as, such, the, correct, mental, attitude, for, zazen, according, to, d, gen, is, one, of, effortless, non, striving, this, is, because, for, d, gen, original, enlightenment, is, already, always, present, while, d, gen, emphasized, the, importance, and, centrality, of, zazen, he, did, not, reject, other, traditional, buddhist, practices, and, his, monasteries, performed, various, traditional, ritual, practices, d, gen, s, monasteries, also, followed, a, strict, monastic, code, based, on, the, chinese, chan, codes, and, d, gen, often, quotes, these, and, various, vinaya, texts, in, his, works, as, such, monastic, rules, and, decorum, saho, was, an, important, element, of, d, gen, s, teaching, one, of, the, most, important, texts, by, d, gen, on, this, topic, is, the, pure, standards, for, the, zen, community, eihei, shingi, d, gen, certainly, saw, zazen, as, the, most, important, zen, practice, and, saw, other, practices, as, secondary, he, frequently, relegates, other, buddhist, practices, to, a, lesser, status, as, he, writes, in, the, bend, wa, commitment, to, zen, is, casting, off, body, and, mind, you, have, no, need, for, incense, offerings, homage, praying, nembutsu, penance, disciplines, or, silent, sutra, readings, just, sit, single, mindedly, while, d, gen, rhetorically, critiques, traditional, practices, in, some, passages, foulk, writes, that, d, gen, did, not, mean, to, reject, literally, any, of, those, standard, buddhist, training, methods, rather, for, d, gen, one, should, engage, in, all, practices, without, attachment, and, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, emptiness, of, all, things, it, is, from, this, perspective, that, d, gen, writes, we, should, not, engage, in, any, practice, which, is, merely, a, conventional, category, which, separates, one, kind, of, activity, from, another, indeed, according, to, foulk, the, specific, rituals, that, seem, to, be, disavowed, in, the, bendowa, passage, are, all, prescribed, for, zen, monks, often, in, great, detail, in, dogen, s, other, writings, in, kuyo, shobutsu, dogen, recommends, the, practice, of, offering, incense, and, making, worshipful, prostrations, before, buddha, images, and, stupas, as, prescribed, in, the, sutras, and, vinaya, texts, in, raihai, tokuzui, he, urges, trainees, to, revere, enlightened, teachers, and, to, make, offerings, and, prostrations, to, them, describing, this, as, a, practice, which, helps, pave, the, way, to, one, s, own, awakening, in, chiji, shingi, he, stipulates, that, the, vegetable, garden, manager, in, a, monastery, should, participate, together, with, the, main, body, of, monks, in, sutra, chanting, services, fugin, recitation, services, nenju, in, which, buddhas, names, are, chanted, a, form, of, nenbutsu, practice, and, other, major, ceremonies, and, that, he, should, burn, incense, and, make, prostrations, shoko, raihai, and, recite, the, buddhas, names, in, prayer, morning, and, evening, when, at, work, in, the, garden, the, practice, of, repentences, sange, is, encouraged, in, dogen, s, kesa, kudoku, in, his, sanji, go, and, his, keisei, sanshiki, finally, in, kankin, dogen, gives, detailed, directions, for, sutra, reading, services, kankin, in, which, as, he, explains, texts, could, be, read, either, silently, or, aloud, as, a, means, of, producing, merit, to, be, dedicated, to, any, number, of, ends, including, the, satisfaction, of, wishes, made, by, lay, donors, or, prayers, on, behalf, of, the, emperor, the, primary, concept, underlying, d, gen, s, zen, practice, is, the, oneness, of, practice, verification, or, the, unity, of, cultivation, and, confirmation, shush, itt, shush, ichinyo, the, term, sh, verification, affirmation, confirmation, attainment, is, also, sometimes, translated, as, enlightenment, though, this, translation, is, also, questioned, by, some, scholars, the, shush, itt, teaching, was, first, and, most, famously, explained, in, the, bend, wa, a, talk, on, the, endeavor, of, the, path, c, 1231, as, follows, to, think, that, practice, and, verification, are, not, one, is, the, view, of, infidels, in, the, buddha, dharma, practice, and, verification, are, the, same, because, it, is, practice, based, on, verification, the, beginner, s, pursuit, of, the, way, is, the, whole, substance, of, original, verification, therefore, in, giving, instruction, on, what, to, be, careful, of, in, the, practice, we, teach, not, to, expect, verification, outside, of, practice, for, is, itself, original, verification, since, it, is, the, verification, of, practice, verification, has, no, limit, since, it, is, the, practice, of, verification, practice, has, no, beginning, in, the, fukanzazengi, universal, recommendation, for, zazen, d, gen, explains, how, to, practice, zazen, and, then, explains, the, nature, of, verification, if, you, grasp, the, point, of, this, the, four, elements, will, become, light, and, at, ease, the, spirit, will, be, fresh, and, sharp, thoughts, will, be, correct, and, clear, the, flavor, of, the, dharma, will, sustain, the, spirit, and, you, will, be, calm, pure, and, joyful, your, daily, life, will, be, your, true, natural, state, once, you, achieve, clarification, you, may, be, likened, to, the, dragon, gaining, the, water, or, the, tiger, taking, to, the, mountains, you, should, realize, that, when, right, thought, is, present, dullness, and, agitation, cannot, intrude, for, d, gen, buddha, nature, or, bussh, is, all, of, reality, all, things, in, the, sh, b, genz, d, gen, writes, that, whole, being, is, the, buddha, nature, and, that, even, inanimate, objects, rocks, sand, water, are, an, expression, of, buddha, nature, he, rejected, any, view, that, saw, buddha, nature, as, a, permanent, substantial, inner, self, or, ground, d, gen, describes, buddha, nature, as, vast, emptiness, the, world, of, becoming, and, writes, that, impermanence, is, in, itself, buddha, nature, according, to, d, gen, therefore, the, very, impermanency, of, grass, and, tree, thicket, and, forest, is, the, buddha, nature, the, very, impermanency, of, men, and, things, body, and, mind, is, the, buddha, nature, nature, and, lands, mountains, and, rivers, are, impermanent, because, they, are, the, buddha, nature, supreme, and, complete, enlightenment, because, it, is, impermanent, is, the, buddha, nature, takashi, james, kodera, writes, that, the, main, source, of, d, gen, s, understanding, of, buddha, nature, is, a, passage, from, the, nirvana, sutra, which, was, widely, understood, as, stating, that, all, sentient, beings, possess, buddha, nature, however, d, gen, interpreted, the, passage, differently, rendering, it, as, follows, all, are, sentient, beings, all, things, are, the, buddha, nature, the, tathagata, abides, constantly, is, non, existent, yet, existent, and, is, change, kodera, explains, that, whereas, in, the, conventional, reading, the, buddha, nature, is, understood, as, a, permanent, essence, inherent, in, all, sentient, beings, d, gen, contends, that, all, things, are, the, buddha, nature, in, the, former, reading, the, buddha, nature, is, a, change, less, potential, but, in, the, latter, it, is, the, eternally, arising, and, perishing, actuality, of, all, things, in, the, world, thus, for, d, gen, buddha, nature, includes, everything, the, totality, of, all, things, including, inanimate, objects, like, grass, trees, and, land, which, are, also, mind, for, d, gen, d, gen, taught, that, through, zazen, one, could, attain, great, realization, or, great, enlightenment, daigo, tettei, which, is, also, called, satori, understanding, knowledge, according, to, ko, un, yamada, d, gen, repeatedly, emphasizes, the, importance, of, each, person, attaining, enlightenment, d, gen, writes, about, this, in, a, fascicle, of, the, sh, b, genz, titled, daigo, which, states, that, when, practitioners, of, zen, attain, daigo, they, have, risen, above, the, discrimination, between, delusion, and, enlightenment, while, d, gen, did, teach, the, importance, of, attaining, enlightenment, he, also, critiqued, certain, ways, of, explaining, it, and, teaching, about, it, according, to, barbara, o, brien, d, gen, critiqued, the, term, kensh, because, the, word, kensh, means, to, see, one, s, nature, which, sets, up, a, dichotomy, between, the, seer, and, the, object, of, seeing, furthermore, according, to, bielefeldt, d, gen, s, zazen, is, a, subtle, state, beyond, either, thinking, or, not, thinking, in, which, body, and, mind, have, been, sloughed, off, it, is, a, state, in, which, all, striving, for, religious, experience, all, expectation, of, satori, daigo, is, left, behind, as, such, while, d, gen, did, not, reject, the, importance, of, satori, he, taught, that, we, should, not, sit, zazen, with, the, goal, of, satori, in, mind, d, gen, s, conception, of, being, time, or, time, being, uji, is, an, essential, element, of, his, metaphysics, in, the, sh, b, genz, according, to, the, traditional, interpretation, uji, here, means, time, itself, is, being, and, all, being, is, time, uji, is, all, the, changing, and, dynamic, activities, that, exist, as, the, flow, of, becoming, all, beings, in, the, entire, world, are, time, the, two, terms, are, thus, spoken, of, concurrently, to, emphasize, that, the, things, are, not, to, be, viewed, as, separate, concepts, moreover, the, aim, is, to, not, abstract, time, and, being, as, rational, concepts, this, view, has, been, developed, by, scholars, such, as, steven, heine, joan, stambaugh, and, others, and, has, served, as, a, motivation, to, compare, d, gen, s, work, to, that, of, martin, heidegger, s, dasein, rein, raud, has, argued, that, this, view, is, not, correct, and, that, d, gen, asserts, that, all, existence, is, momentary, showing, that, such, a, reading, would, make, quite, a, few, of, the, rather, cryptic, passages, in, the, sh, b, genz, quite, lucid, another, essential, element, of, d, gen, s, performative, metaphysics, is, his, conception, of, perfect, expression, d, toku, while, a, radically, critical, view, on, language, as, soteriologically, inefficient, if, not, positively, harmful, is, what, zen, buddhism, is, famous, for, it, can, be, argued, within, the, framework, of, a, rational, theory, of, language, against, an, obscurantist, interpretation, of, zen, that, time, and, again, invokes, experience, d, gen, distinguishes, two, types, of, language, monji, the, first, after, ernst, cassirer, discursive, type, that, constantly, structures, our, experiences, and, more, fundamentally, in, fact, produces, the, world, we, experience, in, the, first, place, and, d, toku, the, second, presentative, type, which, takes, a, holistic, stance, and, establishes, the, totality, of, significations, through, a, texture, of, relations, as, d, ll, points, out, it, is, this, second, type, as, m, ller, holds, that, allows, for, a, positive, view, of, language, even, from, the, radically, skeptical, perspective, of, d, gen, s, brand, of, zen, buddhism, d, gen, was, sometimes, critical, of, the, rinzai, school, for, their, formulaic, and, intellectual, koan, practice, such, as, the, practice, of, the, shiryoken, or, four, discernments, as, well, as, for, their, disregard, for, the, sutras, recently, in, the, great, sung, dynasty, of, china, there, are, many, who, call, themselves, zen, masters, they, do, not, know, the, length, and, breadth, of, the, buddha, dharma, they, have, heard, and, seen, but, little, they, memorize, two, or, three, sayings, of, lin, chi, and, yun, men, and, think, this, is, the, whole, way, of, the, buddha, dharma, if, the, dharma, of, the, buddha, could, be, condensed, in, two, or, three, sayings,
