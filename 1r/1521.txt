and, palermo, in, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, provided, garibaldi, with, an, opportunity, he, gathered, a, group, of, volunteers, called, i, mille, the, thousand, or, the, redshirts, as, popularly, known, in, two, ships, named, il, piemonte, and, il, lombardo, and, left, from, quarto, in, genoa, on, 5, may, in, the, evening, and, landed, at, marsala, on, the, westernmost, point, of, sicily, on, 11, may, swelling, the, ranks, of, his, army, with, scattered, bands, of, local, rebels, garibaldi, led, 800, volunteers, to, victory, over, an, enemy, force, of, 1, 500, at, the, battle, of, calatafimi, on, 15, may, he, used, the, counter, intuitive, tactic, of, an, uphill, bayonet, charge, he, saw, that, the, hill, was, terraced, and, the, terraces, would, shelter, his, advancing, men, though, small, by, comparison, with, the, coming, clashes, at, palermo, milazzo, and, volturno, this, battle, was, decisive, in, establishing, garibaldi, s, power, on, the, island, an, apocryphal, but, realistic, story, had, him, say, to, his, lieutenant, nino, bixio, here, we, either, make, italy, or, we, die, 253, his, neapolitan, adversaries, now, fought, for, him, which, led, to, accusations, of, bribery, being, made, against, their, leader, francesco, landi, the, next, day, he, declared, himself, dictator, of, sicily, in, the, name, of, victor, emmanuel, ii, of, italy, he, advanced, to, the, outskirts, of, palermo, the, capital, of, the, island, and, launched, a, siege, on, 27, may, he, had, the, support, of, many, inhabitants, who, rose, up, against, the, garrison, but, before, they, could, take, the, city, reinforcements, arrived, and, bombarded, the, city, nearly, to, ruins, at, this, time, a, british, admiral, intervened, and, facilitated, a, truce, by, which, the, neapolitan, royal, troops, and, warships, surrendered, the, city, and, departed, the, young, henry, adams, later, to, become, a, distinguished, american, writer, visited, the, city, in, june, and, described, the, situation, along, with, his, meeting, with, garibaldi, in, a, long, and, vivid, letter, to, his, older, brother, charles, historians, clough, et, al, argue, that, garibaldi, s, thousand, were, students, independent, artisans, and, professionals, not, peasants, the, support, given, by, sicilian, peasants, was, not, out, of, a, sense, of, patriotism, but, from, their, hatred, of, exploitive, landlords, and, oppressive, neapolitan, officials, garibaldi, himself, had, no, interest, in, social, revolution, and, instead, sided, with, the, sicilian, landlords, against, the, rioting, peasants, by, conquering, palermo, garibaldi, had, won, a, signal, victory, he, gained, worldwide, renown, and, the, adulation, of, italians, faith, in, his, prowess, was, so, strong, that, doubt, confusion, and, dismay, seized, even, the, neapolitan, court, six, weeks, later, he, marched, against, messina, in, the, east, of, the, island, winning, a, ferocious, and, difficult, battle, of, milazzo, by, the, end, of, july, only, the, citadel, resisted, having, conquered, sicily, he, crossed, the, strait, of, messina, and, marched, north, garibaldi, s, progress, was, met, with, more, celebration, than, resistance, and, on, 7, september, he, entered, the, capital, city, of, naples, by, train, despite, taking, naples, however, he, had, not, to, this, point, defeated, the, neapolitan, army, garibaldi, s, volunteer, army, of, 24, 000, was, not, able, to, conclusively, defeat, the, reorganized, neapolitan, army, about, 25, 000, men, on, 30, september, at, the, battle, of, volturno, this, was, the, largest, battle, he, ever, fought, but, its, outcome, was, effectively, decided, by, the, arrival, of, the, royal, sardinian, army, meanwhile, garibaldi, s, victories, started, to, cause, disquiet, to, the, piedmont, and, particularly, the, sardinian, prime, minister, camillo, benso, count, of, cavour, he, feared, that, should, the, revolutionaries, succeed, in, conquering, the, entire, neapolitan, state, they, would, then, invade, the, papal, states, which, would, lead, to, france, intervening, the, piedmontese, themselves, had, conquered, most, of, the, pope, s, territories, in, their, march, south, to, meet, garibaldi, but, they, had, deliberately, avoided, rome, the, capital, of, the, papal, state, garibaldi, deeply, disliked, cavour, to, an, extent, he, simply, mistrusted, cavour, s, pragmatism, and, realpolitik, but, he, also, bore, a, personal, grudge, for, cavour, s, trading, away, his, home, city, of, nice, to, the, french, the,

in, his, famous, meeting, with, victor, emmanuel, at, teano, on, 26, october, 1860, garibaldi, greeted, him, as, king, of, italy, and, shook, his, hand, garibaldi, rode, into, naples, at, the, king, s, side, on, 7, november, then, retired, to, the, rocky, island, of, caprera, refusing, to, accept, any, reward, for, his, services, at, the, outbreak, of, the, american, civil, war, in, 1861, garibaldi, was, a, very, popular, figure, the, 39th, new, york, volunteer, infantry, regiment, was, named, garibaldi, guard, after, him, garibaldi, expressed, interest, in, aiding, the, union, and, he, was, offered, a, major, general, s, commission, in, the, u, s, army, through, a, letter, from, secretary, of, state, william, h, seward, to, henry, shelton, sanford, the, u, s, minister, at, brussels, 27, july, 1861, on, 9, september, 1861, sanford, met, with, garibaldi, and, reported, the, result, of, the, meeting, to, seward, he, said, that, the, only, way, in, which, he, could, render, service, as, he, ardently, desired, to, do, to, the, cause, of, the, united, states, was, as, commander, in, chief, of, its, forces, that, he, would, only, go, as, such, and, with, the, additional, contingent, power, to, be, governed, by, events, of, declaring, the, abolition, of, slavery, that, he, would, be, of, little, use, without, the, first, and, without, the, second, it, would, appear, like, a, civil, war, in, which, the, world, at, large, could, have, little, interest, or, sympathy, but, abraham, lincoln, was, not, ready, to, free, the, slaves, sanford, s, meeting, with, garibaldi, occurred, a, year, before, lincoln, issued, the, preliminary, emancipation, proclamation, sanford, s, mission, was, hopeless, and, garibaldi, did, not, join, the, union, army, a, historian, of, the, american, civil, war, don, h, doyle, however, wrote, garibaldi, s, full, throated, endorsement, of, the, union, cause, roused, popular, support, just, as, news, of, the, emancipation, proclamation, broke, in, europe, on, 6, august, 1863, after, lincoln, had, issued, the, final, emancipation, proclamation, garibaldi, wrote, to, lincoln, posterity, will, call, you, the, great, emancipator, a, more, enviable, title, than, any, crown, could, be, and, greater, than, any, merely, mundane, treasure, on, 5, october, 1860, garibaldi, set, up, the, international, legion, bringing, together, different, national, divisions, of, french, poles, swiss, germans, and, other, nationalities, with, a, view, not, just, of, finishing, the, liberation, of, italy, but, also, of, their, homelands, with, the, motto, free, from, the, alps, to, the, adriatic, the, unification, movement, set, its, gaze, on, rome, and, venice, mazzini, was, discontented, with, the, perpetuation, of, monarchial, government, and, continued, to, agitate, for, a, republic, garibaldi, frustrated, at, inaction, by, the, king, and, bristling, over, perceived, snubs, organized, a, new, venture, this, time, he, intended, to, take, on, the, papal, states, garibaldi, himself, was, intensely, anti, catholic, and, anti, papal, his, efforts, to, overthrow, the, pope, by, military, action, mobilized, anti, catholic, support, on, 28, september, 1862, 500, irish, labourers, disrupted, a, pro, garibaldi, meeting, in, london, by, chanting, god, and, rome, which, triggered, weeks, of, ethnic, conflict, between, protestants, and, irish, catholics, garibaldi, s, hostility, to, the, pope, s, temporal, domain, was, viewed, with, great, distrust, by, catholics, around, the, world, and, the, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, had, guaranteed, the, independence, of, rome, from, italy, by, stationing, a, french, garrison, there, victor, emmanuel, was, wary, of, the, international, repercussions, of, attacking, rome, and, the, pope, s, seat, there, and, discouraged, his, subjects, from, participating, in, revolutionary, ventures, with, such, intentions, nonetheless, garibaldi, believed, he, had, the, secret, support, of, his, government, once, he, was, excommunicated, by, the, pope, he, chose, the, protestant, pastor, alessandro, gavazzi, as, his, army, chaplain, in, june, 1862, he, sailed, from, genoa, to, palermo, to, gather, volunteers, for, the, impending, campaign, under, the, slogan, roma, o, morte, rome, or, death, an, enthusiastic, party, quickly, joined, him, and, he, turned, for, messina, hoping, to, cross, to, the, mainland, there, he, arrived, with, a, force, of, around, two, thousand, but, the, garrison, proved, loyal, to, the, king, s, instructions, and, barred, his, passage, they, turned, south, and, set, sail, from, catania, where, garibaldi, declared, that, he, would, enter, rome, as, a, victor, or, perish, beneath, its, walls, he, landed, at, melito, di, porto, salvo, on, 14, august, and, marched, at, once, into, the, calabrian, mountains, far, from, supporting, this, endeavour, the, italian, government, was, quite, disapproving, general, enrico, cialdini, dispatched, a, division, of, the, regular, army, under, colonel, emilio, pallavicini, against, the, volunteer, bands, on, 28, august, the, two, forces, met, in, the, rugged, aspromonte, one, of, the, regulars, fired, a, chance, shot, and, several, volleys, followed, killing, a, few, of, the, volunteers, the, fighting, ended, quickly, as, garibaldi, forbade, his, men, to, return, fire, on, fellow, subjects, of, the, kingdom, of, italy, many, of, the, volunteers, were, taken, prisoner, including, garibaldi, who, had, been, wounded, by, a, shot, in, the, foot, the, episode, was, the, origin, of, a, famous, italian, nursery, rhyme, garibaldi, fu, ferito, garibaldi, was, wounded, a, government, steamer, took, him, to, a, prison, at, varignano, near, la, spezia, where, he, was, held, in, a, sort, of, honourable, imprisonment, and, underwent, a, tedious, and, painful, operation, to, heal, his, wound, his, venture, had, failed, but, he, was, consoled, by, europe, s, sympathy, and, continued, interest, after, he, regained, his, health, the, government, released, garibaldi, and, let, him, return, to, caprera, en, route, to, london, in, 1864, he, stopped, briefly, in, malta, where, many, admirers, visited, him, in, his, hotel, protests, by, opponents, of, his, anticlericalism, were, suppressed, by, the, authorities, in, london, his, presence, was, received, with, enthusiasm, by, the, population, he, met, the, british, prime, minister, viscount, palmerston, as, well, as, revolutionaries, then, living, in, exile, in, the, city, at, that, time, his, ambitious, international, project, included, the, liberation, of, a, range, of, occupied, nations, such, as, croatia, greece, and, hungary, he, also, visited, bedford, and, was, given, a, tour, of, the, britannia, iron, works, where, he, planted, a, tree, which, was, cut, down, in, 1944, due, to, decay, garibaldi, took, up, arms, again, in, 1866, this, time, with, the, full, support, of, the, italian, government, the, austro, prussian, war, had, broken, out, and, italy, had, allied, with, prussia, against, the, austrian, empire, in, the, hope, of, taking, venetia, from, austrian, rule, in, the, third, italian, war, of, independence, garibaldi, gathered, again, his, hunters, of, the, alps, now, some, 40, 000, strong, and, led, them, into, the, trentino, he, defeated, the, austrians, at, bezzecca, and, made, for, trento, the, italian, regular, forces, were, defeated, at, lissa, on, the, sea, and, made, little, progress, on, land, after, the, disaster, of, custoza, the, sides, signed, an, armistice, by, which, austria, ceded, venetia, to, italy, but, this, result, was, largely, due, to, prussia, s, successes, on, the, northern, front, garibaldi, s, advance, through, trentino, was, for, nought, and, he, was, ordered, to, stop, his, advance, to, trento, garibaldi, answered, with, a, short, telegram, from, the, main, square, of, bezzecca, with, the, famous, motto, obbedisco, i, obey, after, the, war, garibaldi, led, a, political, party, that, agitated, for, the, capture, of, rome, the, peninsula, s, ancient, capital, in, 1867, he, again, marched, on, the, city, but, the, papal, army, supported, by, a, french, auxiliary, force, proved, a, match, for, his, badly, armed, volunteers, he, was, shot, in, the, leg, in, the, battle, of, mentana, and, had, to, withdraw, from, the, papal, territory, the, italian, government, again, imprisoned, him, for, some, time, after, which, he, returned, to, caprera, in, the, same, year, garibaldi, sought, international, support, for, altogether, eliminating, the, papacy, at, the, 1867, congress, for, the, league, of, peace, and, freedom, in, geneva, he, proposed, the, papacy, being, the, most, harmful, of, all, secret, societies, ought, to, be, abolished, when, the, franco, prussian, war, broke, out, in, july, 1870, italian, public, opinion, heavily, favoured, the, prussians, and, many, italians, attempted, to, sign, up, as, volunteers, at, the, prussian, embassy, in, florence, after, the, french, garrison, was, recalled, from, rome, the, italian, army, captured, the, papal, states, without, garibaldi, s, assistance, following, the, wartime, collapse, of, the, second, french, empire, after, the, battle, of, sedan, garibaldi, undaunted, by, the, recent, hostility, shown, to, him, by, the, men, of, napoleon, iii, switched, his, support, to, the, newly, declared, government, of, national, defense, of, france, on, 7, september, 1870, within, three, days, of, the, revolution, in, paris, that, ended, the, empire, he, wrote, to, the, movimento, of, genoa, yesterday, i, said, to, you, war, to, the, death, to, bonaparte, today, i, say, to, you, rescue, the, french, republic, by, every, means, subsequently, garibaldi, went, to, france, and, assumed, command, of, the, army, of, the, vosges, an, army, of, volunteers, french, socialist, louis, blanc, referred, to, garibaldi, as, a, soldier, of, revolutionary, cosmopolitanism, based, on, his, support, for, liberation, movements, throughout, the, world, after, the, war, he, was, elected, to, the, french, national, assembly, where, he, briefly, served, as, a, member, of, parliament, for, alpes, maritimes, before, returning, to, caprera, when, the, paris, commune, erupted, in, 1871, garibaldi, joined, with, younger, radicals, such, as, felice, cavallotti, in, declaring, his, full, support, for, the, communards, and, internationalism, garibaldi, suggested, a, grand, alliance, between, various, factions, of, the, left, why, don, t, we, pull, together, in, one, organized, group, the, freemasonry, democratic, societies, workers, clubs, rationalists, mutual, aid, etc, which, have, the, same, tendency, towards, good, he, began, organizing, a, congress, of, unity, which, was, supported, by, many, of, the, radical, free, thinking, and, socialist, groups, throughout, italy, such, as, la, plebe, the, congress, was, held, in, the, teatro, argentina, despite, being, banned, by, the, government, and, endorsed, a, set, of, radical, policies, including, universal, suffrage, progressive, taxation, compulsory, lay, education, administrative, reform, and, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, garibaldi, had, long, claimed, an, interest, in, vague, ethical, socialism, such, as, that, advanced, by, henri, saint, simon, and, saw, the, struggle, for, liberty, as, an, international, affair, one, which, does, not, make, any, distinction, between, the, african, and, the, american, the, european, and, the, asian, and, therefore, proclaims, the, fraternity, of, all, men, whatever, nation, they, belong, to, he, interpreted, the, international, workingmen, s, association, as, an, extension, of, the, humanitarian, ideals, for, which, he, had, always, fought, although, he, did, not, agree, with, their, calls, for, the, abolition, of, property, garibaldi, defended, the, communards, and, the, first, international, against, the, attacks, of, their, enemies, is, it, not, the, product, of, the, abnormal, state, in, which, society, finds, itself, in, the, world, shouldn, t, a, society, i, mean, a, human, society, in, which, the, majority, struggle, for, subsistence, and, the, minority, want, to, take, the, larger, part, of, the, product, of, the, former, through, deceptions, and, violence, but, without, hard, work, arouse, discontent, and, thoughts, of, revenge, amongst, those, who, suffer, garibaldi, wrote, a, letter, to, celso, ceretti, in, which, he, declared, the, international, is, the, sun, of, the, future, the, letter, was, printed, in, dozens, of, workers, news, sheets, and, papers, and, was, instrumental, in, persuading, many, fence, sitters, to, join, the, organization, after, garibaldi, s, death, many, of, his, disciples, embraced, the, libertarian, socialist, ideas, of, mikhail, bakunin, as, italy, still, lacked, an, industrial, proletariat, garibaldi, s, socialism, represented, most, accurately, craft, trade, unionism, and, a, general, focus, on, economic, egalitarianism, his, socialism, was, a, socialism, wherein, the, struggle, against, every, injustice, and, a, love, for, freedom, predominated, garibaldi, was, not, an, unpractical, man, but, an, active, witness, of, that, kind, of, generosity, in, feelings, and, firm, wish, for, justice, in, the, first, volume, of, carl, landauer, s, european, socialism, garibaldi, is, mentioned, alongside, mazzini, as, outstanding, italian, revolutionaries, according, to, denis, mack, smith, the, difference, is, not, so, large, when, we, find, what, garibaldi, meant, by, the, term, socialism, for, him, was, nothing, very, revolutionary, and, perhaps, he, flaunted, the, word, partly, because, he, delighted, to, feel, that, it, would, shock, the, mazzinians, in, describing, the, move, to, the, left, of, garibaldi, and, the, mazzinians, lucy, riall, writes, that, this, emphasis, by, younger, radicals, on, the, social, question, was, paralleled, by, an, increase, in, what, was, called, internationalist, or, socialist, activity, mostly, bakuninist, anarchism, throughout, northern, and, southern, italy, which, was, given, a, big, boost, by, the, paris, commune, the, rise, of, this, socialism, represented, a, genuine, challenge, to, mazzini, and, the, mazzinian, emphasis, on, politics, and, culture, and, mazzinis, death, early, in, 1872, only, served, to, underline, the, prevailing, sense, that, his, political, era, was, over, garibaldi, now, broke, definitively, with, mazzini, and, this, time, he, moved, to, the, left, of, him, he, came, out, entirely, in, favour, of, the, paris, commune, and, internationalism, and, his, stance, brought, him, much, closer, to, the, younger, radicals, especially, felice, cavallotti, and, gave, him, a, new, lease, on, political, life, from, his, support, was, born, an, initiative, to, relaunch, a, broad, party, of, the, radical, left, despite, being, elected, again, to, the, italian, parliament, first, as, part, of, the, historical, left, and, then, of, the, historical, far, left, garibaldi, spent, much, of, his, late, years, on, caprera, however, he, still, managed, to, serve, the, italian, parliament, with, extreme, distinction, and, supported, an, ambitious, project, of, land, reclamation, in, the, marshy, areas, of, southern, lazio, in, 1879, garibaldi, founded, the, league, of, democracy, along, with, cavallotti, alberto, mario, and, agostino, bertani, which, reiterated, his, support, for, universal, suffrage, abolition, of, ecclesiastical, property, the, legal, and, political, emancipation, of, women, and, a, plan, of, public, works, to, improve, the, roman, countryside, that, was, completed, in, a, 6, october, 1875, letter, from, caprera, to, my, brothers, of, the, herzegovina, and, to, the, oppressed, of, eastern, europe, garibaldi, wrote, the, turk, must, go, away, to, broussa, he, descended, like, a, wolf, passing, the, bosphorus, devastating, murdering, and, violating, those, populations, who, gave, us, the, pelasgi, who, were, perhaps, the, first, civilisers, of, europe, he, must, no, longer, tread, upon, that, part, of, the, world, kept, by, him, in, misery, at, broussa, with, his, vices, depredations, and, cruelties, he, will, find, enough, people, of, asia, minor, to, torment, and, plunge,

he, stated, he, was, not, a, catholic, and, was, willing, to, become, a, protestant, though, raised, a, catholic, he, abjured, christianity, towards, the, end, of, his, life, and, became, a, deist, and, a, supporter, of, freemasonry, on, his, deathbed, garibaldi, asked, for, his, bed, to, be, moved, to, where, he, could, view, the, sea, on, his, death, on, 2, june, 1882, at, the, age, of, almost, 75, his, wishes, for, a, simple, funeral, and, cremation, were, not, respected, he, was, buried, on, his, farm, on, the, island, of, caprera, alongside, his, last, wife, and, some, of, his, children, in, 2012, garibaldi, s, descendants, announced, that, with, permission, from, authorities, they, would, have, garibaldi, s, remains, exhumed, to, confirm, through, dna, analysis, that, the, remains, in, the, tomb, are, indeed, garibaldi, s, some, anticipated, that, there, would, be, a, debate, about, whether, to, preserve, the, remains, or, to, grant, his, final, wish, for, a, simple, cremation, in, 2013, personnel, changes, at, the, ministry, of, culture, sidelined, the, exhumation, plans, the, new, authorities, were, less, than, enthusiastic, about, the, plan, garibaldi, s, popularity, skill, at, rousing, the, common, people, and, his, military, exploits, are, all, credited, with, making, the, unification, of, italy, possible, he, also, served, as, a, global, exemplar, of, mid, 19th, century, revolutionary, liberalism, and, nationalism, after, the, liberation, of, southern, italy, from, the, neapolitan, monarchy, in, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, garibaldi,

symbolized, the, risorgimento, italy, of, those, dramatic, years, and, the, intrepid, audacity, that, contributed, so, much, to, the, formation, of, the, italian, nation, a, professional, liberator,

outstanding, literary, historian, of, his, generation, it, depicted, garibaldi, as, a, carlylean, hero, poet, patriot, and, man, of, action, whose, inspired, leadership, created, the, italian, nation, for, trevelyan, garibaldi, was, the, champion, of, freedom, progress, and, tolerance, who, vanquished, the, despotism, reaction, and, obscurantism, of, the, austrian, empire, and, the, neapolitan, monarchy, the, books, were, also, notable, for, their, vivid, evocation, of, landscape, trevelyan, had, himself, followed, the, course, of, garibaldi, s, marches, for, their, innovative, use, of, documentary, and, oral, sources, and, for, their, spirited, accounts, of, battles, and, military, campaigns, along, with, giuseppe, mazzini, and, other, europeans, garibaldi, supported, the, creation, of, a, european, federation, many, europeans, expected, that, the, 1871, unification, of, germany, would, make, germany, a, european, and, world, leader, that, would, champion, humanitarian, policies, this, idea, is, apparent, in, the, following, letter, garibaldi, sent, to, karl, blind, on, 10, april, 1865, the, progress, of, humanity, seems, to, have, come, to, a, halt, and, you, with, your, superior, intelligence, will, know, why, the, reason, is, that, the, world, lacks, a, nation, which, possesses, true, leadership, such, leadership, of, course, is, required, not, to, dominate, other, peoples, but, to, lead, them, along, the, path, of, duty, to, lead, them, toward, the, brotherhood, of, nations, where, all, the, barriers, erected, by, egoism, will, be, destroyed, we, need, the, kind, of, leadership, which, in, the, true, tradition, of, medieval, chivalry, would, devote, itself, to, redressing, wrongs, supporting, the, weak, sacrificing, momentary, gains, and, material, advantage, for, the, much, finer, and, more, satisfying, achievement, of, relieving, the, suffering, of, our, fellow, men, we, need, a, nation, courageous, enough, to, give, us, a, lead, in, this, direction, it, would, rally, to, its, cause, all, those, who, are, suffering, wrong, or, who, aspire, to, a, better, life, and, all, those, who, are, now, enduring, foreign, oppression, this, role, of, world, leadership, left, vacant, as, things, are, today, might, well, be, occupied, by, the, german, nation, you, germans, with, your, grave, and, philosophic, character, might, well, be, the, ones, who, could, win, the, confidence, of, others, and, guarantee, the, future, stability, of, the, international, community, let, us, hope, then, that, you, can, use, your, energy, to, overcome, your, moth, eaten, thirty, tyrants, of, the, various, german, states, let, us, hope, that, in, the, centre, of, europe, you, can, then, make, a, unified, nation, out, of, your, fifty, million, all, the, rest, of, us, would, eagerly, and, joyfully, follow, you, through, the, years, garibaldi, was, showered, with, admiration, and, praises, by, many, intellectuals, and, political, figures,
