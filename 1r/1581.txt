speaking, assimilated, jews, herzl, stated, he, was, of, both, ashkenazi, and, sephardic, lineage, predominantely, through, his, paternal, line, and, to, a, lesser, extent, through, the, maternal, line, but, there, is, no, evidence, for, the, claim, of, sephardic, origins, his, father, s, family, had, migrated, from, zimony, today, zemun, serbia, to, bohemia, in, 1739, where, they, were,

herzl, was, aspired, to, follow, the, footsteps, of, ferdinand, de, lesseps, builder, of, the, suez, canal, but, did, not, succeed, in, the, sciences, and, instead, developed, a, growing, enthusiasm, for, poetry, and, humanities, this, passion, later, developed, into, a, successful, career, in, journalism, and, a, less, celebrated, pursuit, of, playwrighting, according, to, amos, elon, as, a, young, man, herzl, was, an, ardent, germanophile, who, saw, the, germans, as, the, best, kulturvolk, cultured, people, in, central, europe, and, embraced, the, german, ideal, of, bildung, whereby, reading, great, works, of, literature, by, goethe, and, shakespeare, could, allow, one, to, appreciate, the, beautiful, things, in, life, and, thus, become, a, morally, better, person, the, bildung, theory, tended, to, equate, beauty, with, goodness, herzl, believed, that, through, bildung, hungarian, jews, such, as, himself, could, shake, off, their, shameful, jewish, characteristics, caused, by, long, centuries, of, impoverishment, and, oppression, and, become, civilized, central, europeans, a, true, kulturvolk, along, the, german, lines, in, 1878, after, pauline, s, death, the, herzl, family, moved, to, vienna, austria, hungary, and, lived, in, the, 9th, district, alsergrund, at, the, university, of, vienna, herzl, studied, law, as, a, young, law, student, herzl, became, a, member, of, the, german, nationalist, burschenschaft, fraternity, albia, which, had, the, motto, ehre, freiheit, vaterland, honor, freedom, fatherland, he, later, resigned, in, protest, at, the, organisation, s, antisemitism, after, a, brief, legal, career, in, the, university, of, vienna, and, salzburg, he, devoted, himself, to, journalism, and, literature, working, as, a, journalist, for, a, viennese, newspaper, and, a, correspondent, for, neue, freie, presse, in, paris, occasionally, making, special, trips, to, london, and, istanbul, he, later, became, literary, editor, of, neue, freie, presse, and, wrote, several, comedies, and, dramas, for, the, viennese, stage, his, early, work, did, not, focus, on, jewish, life, it, was, of, the, feuilleton, order, descriptive, rather, than, political, as, the, paris, correspondent, for, neue, freie, presse, herzl, followed, the, dreyfus, affair, a, political, scandal, that, divided, the, third, french, republic, from, 1894, until, its, resolution, in, 1906, it, was, a, notorious, antisemitic, incident, in, france, in, which, a, jewish, french, army, captain, was, falsely, convicted, of, spying, for, germany, herzl, was, witness, to, mass, rallies, in, paris, following, the, dreyfus, trial, there, has, been, some, controversy, surrounding, the, impact, that, this, event, had, on, herzl, and, his, conversion, to, zionism, herzl, himself, stated, that, the, dreyfus, case, turned, him, into, a, zionist, and, that, he, was, particularly, affected, by, chants, of, death, to, the, jews, from, the, crowds, this, had, been, the, widely, held, belief, for, some, time, however, some, modern, scholars, now, believe, that, due, to, little, mention, of, the, dreyfus, affair, in, herzl, s, earlier, accounts, and, a, seemingly, contrary, reference, he, made, in, them, to, shouts, of, death, to, the, traitor, he, may, have, exaggerated, the, influence, it, had, on, him, in, order, to, create, further, support, for, his, goals, jacques, kornberg, claims, that, the, dreyfus, influence, was, a, myth, that, herzl, did, not, feel, necessary, to, deflate, and, that, he, also, believed, that, dreyfus, was, guilty, another, modern, claim, is, that, while, upset, by, antisemitism, evident, in, french, society, herzl, like, most, contemporary, observers, initially, believed, dreyfus, was, guilty, and, only, claimed, to, have, been, inspired, by, the, affair, years, later, when, it, had, become, an, international, cause, c, l, bre, rather, it, was, the, rise, to, power, of, the, antisemitic, demagogue, karl, lueger, in, vienna, in, 1895, that, seems, to, have, had, a, greater, effect, on, herzl, before, the, pro, dreyfus, campaign, had, fully, emerged, it, was, at, this, time, that, herzl, wrote, his, play, the, new, ghetto, which, shows, the, ambivalence, and, lack, of, real, security, and, equality, of, emancipated, well, to, do, jews, in, vienna, the, protagonist, is, an, assimilated, jewish, lawyer, who, tries, unsuccessfully, to, break, through, the, social, ghetto, enforced, on, western, jews, according, to, henry, wickham, steed, herzl, was, initially, fanatically, devoted, to, the, propagation, of, jewish, german, liberal, assimilationist, doctrine, however, herzl, came, to, reject, his, early, ideas, regarding, jewish, emancipation, and, assimilation, and, to, believe, that, the, jews, must, remove, themselves, from, europe, herzl, grew, to, believe, that, antisemitism, could, not, be, defeated, or, cured, only, avoided, and, that, the, only, way, to, avoid, it, was, the, establishment, of, a, jewish, state, in, june, 1895, he, wrote, in, his, diary, in, paris, as, i, have, said, i, achieved, a, freer, attitude, toward, anti, semitism, above, all, i, recognized, the, emptiness, and, futility, of, trying, to, combat, anti, semitism, herzl, s, editors, at, neue, freie, presse, refused, any, publication, of, his, zionist, political, activities, a, mental, clash, gripped, herzl, between, the, craving, for, literary, success, and, a, desire, to, act, as, a, public, figure, around, this, time, herzl, started, writing, pamphlets, about, a, jewish, state, herzl, claimed, that, these, pamphlets, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, the, zionist, movement, and, they, did, play, a, large, role, in, the, movement, s, rise, and, success, his, testimony, before, the, british, royal, commission, reflected, his, fundamental, romantic, liberal, view, on, life, as, the, problem, of, the, jews, beginning, in, late, 1895, herzl, wrote, der, judenstaat, the, state, of, the, jews, which, was, published, february, 1896, to, immediate, acclaim, and, controversy, the, book, argued, that, the, jewish, people, should, leave, europe, for, palestine, their, historic, homeland, the, jews, possessed, a, nationality, all, they, were, missing, was, a, nation, and, a, state, of, their, own, only, through, a, jewish, state, could, they, avoid, antisemitism, express, their, culture, freely, and, practice, their, religion, without, hindrance, herzl, s, ideas, spread, rapidly, throughout, the, jewish, world, and, attracted, international, attention, supporters, of, existing, zionist, movements, such, as, the, hovevei, zion, immediately, allied, themselves, with, him, but, he, also, encountered, bitter, opposition, from, members, of, the, orthodox, community, and, those, seeking, to, integrate, in, non, jewish, society, his, notorious, article, mauschel, published, just, after, the, first, zionist, congress, depicted, jews, who, oppose, zionism, as, constituting, a, despicable, type, of, jew, and, has, often, been, described, as, antisemitic, in, der, judenstaat, he, writes, the, jewish, question, persists, wherever, jews, live, in, appreciable, numbers, wherever, it, does, not, exist, it, is, brought, in, together, with, jewish, immigrants, we, are, naturally, drawn, into, those, places, where, we, are, not, persecuted, and, our, appearance, there, gives, rise, to, persecution, this, is, the, case, and, will, inevitably, be, so, everywhere, even, in, highly, civilised, countries, see, for, instance, france, so, long, as, the, jewish, question, is, not, solved, on, the, political, level, the, book, concludes, therefore, i, believe, that, a, wondrous, generation, of, jews, will, spring, into, existence, the, maccabeans, will, rise, again, let, me, repeat, once, more, my, opening, words, the, jews, who, wish, for, a, state, will, have, it, we, shall, live, at, last, as, free, men, on, our, own, soil, and, die, peacefully, in, our, own, homes, the, world, will, be, freed, by, our, liberty, enriched, by, our, wealth, magnified, by, our, greatness, and, whatever, we, attempt, there, to, accomplish, for, our, own, welfare, will, react, powerfully, and, beneficially, for, the, good, of, humanity, herzl, began, to, energetically, promote, his, ideas, continually, attracting, supporters, jewish, and, non, jewish, according, to, norman, rose, herzl, mapped, out, for, himself, the, role, of, martyr, as, the, parnell, of, the, jews, herzl, saw, an, opportunity, in, the, mid, 1890s, anti, armenian, hamidian, massacres, which, severely, tarnished, the, public, image, of, the, sultan, in, europe, he, proposed, that, in, exchange, for, jewish, settlement, in, palestine, the, zionist, movement, could, work, to, improve, abdul, hamid, ii, s, reputation, and, shore, up, the, empire, s, finances, bernard, lazare, harshly, criticized, this, position, arguing, that, herzl, and, other, delegates, of, the, zionist, congress, have, sent, their, blessing, to, the, worst, of, murderers, returning, from, istanbul, herzl, traveled, to, london, to, report, back, to, the, maccabeans, a, proto, zionist, group, of, established, english, jews, led, by, colonel, albert, goldsmid, in, november, 1895, they, received, him, with, curiosity, indifference, and, coldness, israel, zangwill, bitterly, opposed, herzl, but, after, istanbul, goldsmid, agreed, to, support, herzl, in, london, s, east, end, a, community, of, primarily, yiddish, speaking, recent, eastern, european, jewish, immigrants, herzl, addressed, a, mass, rally, of, thousands, on, 12, july, 1896, and, was, received, with, acclaim, they, granted, herzl, the, mandate, of, leadership, for, zionism, within, six, months, this, mandate, had, been, expanded, throughout, zionist, jewry, the, zionist, movement, grew, rapidly, on, 10, march, 1896, herzl, was, visited, by, reverend, william, hechler, the, anglican, minister, to, the, british, embassy, in, vienna, hechler, had, read, herzl, s, der, judenstaat, and, the, meeting, became, central, to, the, eventual, legitimization, of, herzl, and, zionism, herzl, later, wrote, in, his, diary, next, we, came, to, the, heart, of, the, business, i, said, to, him, theodor, herzl, to, rev, william, hechler, i, must, put, myself, into, direct, and, publicly, known, relations, with, a, responsible, or, non, responsible, ruler, that, is, with, a, minister, of, state, or, a, prince, then, the, jews, will, believe, in, me, and, follow, me, the, most, suitable, personage, would, be, the, german, kaiser, hechler, arranged, an, extended, audience, with, frederick, i, grand, duke, of, baden, in, april, 1896, the, grand, duke, was, the, uncle, of, the, german, emperor, wilhelm, ii, through, the, efforts, of, hechler, and, the, grand, duke, herzl, publicly, met, wilhelm, ii, in, 1898, the, meeting, significantly, advanced, herzl, s, and, zionism, s, legitimacy, in, jewish, and, world, opinion, in, may, 1896, the, english, translation, of, der, judenstaat, appeared, in, london, as, the, jewish, state, herzl, had, earlier, confessed, to, his, friend, max, bodenheimer, that, he, wrote, what, i, had, to, say, without, knowing, my, predecessors, and, it, can, be, assumed, that, i, would, not, have, written, it, had, i, been, familiar, with, the, literature, in, istanbul, ottoman, empire, 15, june, 1896, herzl, saw, an, opportunity, with, the, assistance, of, count, philip, michael, von, nevlinski, a, polish, migr, with, political, contacts, in, the, ottoman, court, herzl, attempted, to, meet, sultan, abdulhamid, ii, in, order, to, present, his, solution, of, a, jewish, state, to, the, sultan, directly, he, failed, to, obtain, an, audience, but, did, succeed, in, visiting, a, number, of, highly, placed, individuals, including, the, grand, vizier, who, received, him, as, a, journalist, representing, the, neue, freie, presse, herzl, presented, his, proposal, to, the, grand, vizier, the, jews, would, pay, the, turkish, foreign, debt, and, help, turkey, regain, its, financial, footing, in, return, for, palestine, as, a, jewish, homeland, prior, to, leaving, istanbul, 29, june, 1896, herzl, was, granted, a, symbolic, medal, of, honor, the, medal, the, commander, s, cross, of, the, order, of, the, medjidie, was, a, public, relations, affirmation, for, herzl, and, the, jewish, world, of, the, seriousness, of, the, negotiations, on, 1, march, 1899, yousef, al, khalidi, the, mayor, of, jerusalem, sent, a, letter, to, zadok, kahn, the, chief, rabbi, of, france, with, the, intention, to, reach, herzl, and, ask, zionists, to, leave, the, area, of, palestine, in, peace, al, khalidi, was, very, familiar, with, zionist, thought, and, the, anti, semitic, environment, in, europe, out, of, which, it, emerged, he, also, perceived, the, danger, zionism, could, expose, jews, to, throughout, the, domains, of, the, ottoman, empire, according, to, scholars, rashid, khalidi, alexander, scholch, and, dominique, perrin, al, khalidi, was, prescient, in, predicting, that, regardless, of, jewish, historic, rights, given, the, geopolitical, context, zionism, could, stir, an, awakening, of, arab, nationalism, uniting, christians, and, muslims, kahn, showed, the, letter, to, theodor, herzl, and, on, 19, march, 1899, herzl, replied, to, al, khalidi, arguing, that, both, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, non, jewish, population, of, palestine, would, benefit, from, jewish, immigration, as, to, al, khalidi, concerns, about, the, non, jewish, majority, population, of, palestine, herzl, replied, rhetorically, who, would, think, of, sending, them, away, and, concluded, ambiguously, that, if, he, the, ottoman, sultan, will, not, accept, it, we, will, search, and, believe, me, we, will, find, elsewhere, what, we, need, rashid, khalidi, notes, that, this, sentiment, was, penned, 4, years, after, herzl, had, confided, to, his, diary, the, idea, of, spiriting, away, the, population, of, whatever, country, was, chosen, for, a, future, jewish, state, to, make, way, for, jews, we, must, expropriate, gently, the, private, property, on, the, estates, assigned, to, us, we, shall, try, to, spirit, the, penniless, population, across, the, border, by, procuring, employment, for, it, in, the, transit, countries, while, denying, it, employment, in, our, own, country, the, property, owners, will, come, over, to, our, side, both, the, process, of, expropriation, and, the, removal, of, the, poor, must, be, carried, out, discreetly, and, circumspectly, on, 17, may, 1901, herzl, met, with, sultan, abdul, hamid, ii, who, turned, down, herzl, s, offer, to, consolidate, the, ottoman, debt, in, exchange, for, a, charter, allowing, the, zionists, access, to, palestine, in, 1897, at, considerable, personal, expense, he, founded, the, zionist, newspaper, die, welt, in, vienna, austria, hungary, and, planned, the, first, zionist, congress, in, basel, switzerland, he, was, elected, president, of, the, congress, a, position, he, held, until, his, death, in, 1904, and, in, 1898, he, began, a, series, of, diplomatic, initiatives, to, build, support, for, a, jewish, country, he, was, received, by, wilhelm, ii, on, several, occasions, one, of, them, in, jerusalem, and, attended, the, hague, peace, conference, enjoying, a, warm, reception, from, many, statesmen, there, his, work, on, autoemancipation, was, pre, figured, by, a, similar, conclusion, drawn, by, marx, s, friend, moses, hess, in, rome, and, jerusalem, 1862, leon, pinsker, had, never, yet, read, it, but, was, aware, of, the, distant, and, far, off, hibbat, zion, herzl, s, philosophical, instruction, highlighted, the, weaknesses, and, vulnerabilities, to, herzl, each, dictator, or, leader, had, a, nationalistic, identity, even, down, to, the, irish, from, wolfe, tone, onwards, he, was, drawn, to, the, mawkishness, of, judaism, rendered, distinctively, as, german, but, he, remained, convinced, that, germany, was, the, centre, hauptsitz, of, antisemitism, rather, than, france, in, a, much, quoted, aside, he, noted, if, there, is, one, thing, i, should, like, to, be, it, is, a, member, of, old, prussian, nobility, herzl, appealed, to, the, nobility, of, jewish, england, the, rothschilds, sir, samuel, montagu, later, cabinet, minister, to, the, chief, rabbis, of, france, and, vienna, the, german, financier, maurice, de, hirsch, who, had, created, the, jewish, colonization, association, in, 1891, to, encourage, mass, emigration, of, russian, jews, to, north, and, south, america, and, would, later, be, repurposed, as, the, palestine, jewish, colonization, association, in, 1924, and, especially, french, philanthropist, and, art, collector, edmond, james, de, rothschild, who, was, already, independently, funding, the, establishment, of, jewish, colonies, in, ottoman, palestine, and, to, whom, herzl, wrote, a, 65, page, long, pitch, in, 1895, he, fared, best, with, israel, zangwill, and, max, nordau, they, were, both, well, known, writers, or, men, of, letters, imagination, that, engenders, understanding, the, correspondence, to, hirsch, who, had, died, in, 1896, led, nowhere, baron, albert, rothschild, had, little, to, do, with, the, jews, herzl, was, disliked, by, the, bankers, finanzjuden, and, detested, them, herzl, was, defiant, of, their, social, authority, he, also, shared, pinsker, s, pessimistic, opinion, that, the, jews, had, no, future, in, europe, that, they, were, too, antisemitic, to, tolerate, because, each, country, in, europe, had, tried, antisemitic, assimilation, in, berlin, they, said, juden, raus, in, a, well, worn, phrase, herzl, therefore, advocated, a, mass, exodus, from, europe, to, the, judenstaat, pinsker, s, manifesto, was, a, cry, for, help, a, warning, to, others, mahnruf, a, call, for, attention, to, their, plight, herzl, s, vision, was, less, about, mental, states, of, jewry, and, more, about, delivering, prescriptive, answers, about, land, the, idea, that, i, have, developed, is, a, very, old, one, it, is, the, restoration, of, the, jewish, state, was, a, follow, up, of, pinsker, s, early, weaker, version, mahnruf, an, seine, stammesgenossen, von, einem, nassichen, juden, herzl, visited, jerusalem, for, the, first, time, in, october, 1898, he, deliberately, coordinated, his, visit, with, that, of, wilhelm, ii, to, secure, what, he, thought, had, been, prearranged, with, the, aid, of, rev, william, hechler, namely, public, world, power, recognition, of, himself, and, zionism, herzl, and, wilhelm, ii, first, met, publicly, on, 29, october, at, mikveh, israel, near, present, day, holon, israel, it, was, a, brief, but, historic, meeting, he, had, a, second, formal, public, audience, with, the, emperor, at, the, latter, s, tent, camp, on, street, of, the, prophets, in, jerusalem, on, 2, november, 1898, the, english, zionist, federation, the, local, branch, of, the, world, zionist, organization, was, founded, in, 1899, after, herzl, had, established, in, austria, in, 1897, in, 1902, 03, herzl, was, invited, to, give, evidence, before, the, british, royal, commission, on, alien, immigration, his, appearance, brought, him, into, close, contact, with, members, of, the, british, government, particularly, with, colonial, secretary, joseph, chamberlain, through, whom, he, negotiated, with, the, egyptian, government, for, a, charter, for, the, settlement, of, the, jews, in, al, arish, in, the, sinai, peninsula, adjoining, southern, palestine, the, project, was, blocked, as, impractical, by, lord, cromer, the, consul, general, in, egypt, in, 1902, he, wrote, a, letter, to, cecil, rhodes, attempting, to, get, his, support, for, jewish, state, then, in, 1903, herzl, attempted, to, obtain, support, for, the, jewish, homeland, from, pope, pius, x, an, idea, broached, at, 6th, zionist, congress, palestine, could, offer, a, safe, refuge, for, those, fleeing, persecution, in, russia, cardinal, rafael, merry, del, val, ordained, that, the, church, s, policy, was, explained, non, possumus, on, such, matters, decreeing, that, as, long, as, the, jews, denied, the, divinity, of, christ, the, catholics, could, not, make, a, declaration, in, their, favour, in, 1903, following, kishinev, pogrom, herzl, visited, st, petersburg, and, was, received, by, sergei, witte, then, finance, minister, and, viacheslav, plehve, minister, of, the, interior, the, latter, placing, on, record, the, attitude, of, his, government, toward, the, zionist, movement, on, that, occasion, herzl, submitted, proposals, for, the, amelioration, of, the, jewish, position, in, russia, at, the, same, time, joseph, chamberlain, floated, the, idea, of, a, jewish, colony, in, what, is, now, kenya, the, plan, became, known, as, the, uganda, project, and, herzl, presented, it, to, the, sixth, zionist, congress, basel, august, 1903, where, a, majority, 295, 178, 98, abstentions,

viennese, zionists, and, the, zionist, executive, in, israel, based, there, the, neumanns, deeply, feared, for, the, safety, of, their, only, child, as, violent, austrian, antisemitism, expanded, in, england, he, read, extensively, about, his, grandfather, zionism, had, not, been, a, significant, part, of, his, background, in, austria, but, stephan, became, an, ardent, zionist, was, the, only, descendant, of, theodor, herzl, to, have, become, one, anglicizing, his, name, to, stephen, norman, during, world, war, ii, norman, enlisted, in, the, british, army, rising, to, the, rank, of, captain, in, the, royal, artillery, in, late, 1945, and, early, 1946, he, took, the, opportunity, to, visit, the, british, mandate, of, palestine, to, see, what, my, grandfather, had, started, he, wrote, in, his, diary, extensively, about, his, trip, what, most, impressed, him, was, the, look, of, freedom, on, the, faces, of, the, children, which, were, not, like, the, sallow, look, of, those, from, the, concentration, camps, of, europe, norman, planned, to, return, to, palestine, following, his, military, discharge, the, zionist, executive, had, worked, for, years, through, l, lauterbach, to, get, norman, to, come, to, palestine, as, a, symbol, of, herzl, s, returning, operation, agatha, of, 29, june, 1946, precluded, that, possibility, local, military, and, police, fanned, out, throughout, the, mandate, and, arrested, jewish, activists, about, 2, 700, individuals, were, arrested, on, 2, july, norman, wrote, to, mrs, stybovitz, kahn, in, haifa, her, father, jacob, kahn, had, been, a, good, friend, of, herzl, and, a, well, known, dutch, banker, before, the, war, norman, wrote, i, intend, to, go, to, palestine, on, a, long, visit, in, the, future, in, fact, as, soon, as, passport, permit, regulations, permit, but, the, dreadful, news, of, the, last, two, days, have, done, nothing, to, make, this, easier, he, never, did, return, to, palestine, discharged, from, the, army, in, late, spring, 1946, without, money, or, job, and, despondent, about, his, future, norman, followed, the, advice, of, selig, brodetsky, h, rosenblum, the, editor, of, haboker, a, tel, aviv, daily, that, later, became, yediot, aharonot, noted, in, late, 1945, that, chaim, weizmann, deeply, resented, the, sudden, intrusion, and, reception, of, norman, when, he, arrived, in, britain, norman, spoke, to, the, zionist, conference, in, london, haboker, reported, something, similar, happened, at, the, zionist, conference, in, london, the, chairman, suddenly, announced, to, the, meeting, that, in, the, hall, there, was, herzl, s, grandson, who, wanted, to, say, a, few, words, the, introduction, was, made, in, an, absolutely, dry, and, official, way, it, was, felt, that, the, chairman, looked, for, and, found, some, stylistic, formula, which, would, satisfy, the, visitor, without, appearing, too, cordial, to, anybody, among, the, audience, in, spite, of, that, there, was, a, great, thrill, in, the, hall, when, norman, mounted, on, the, platform, of, the, praesidium, at, that, moment, dr, weizmann, turned, his, back, on, the, speaker, and, remained, in, this, bodily, and, mental, attitude, until, the, guest, had, finished, his, speech, the, 1945, article, went, on, to, note, that, norman, was, snubbed, by, weizmann, and, by, some, in, palestine, during, his, visit, because, of, ego, jealousy, vanity, and, their, own, personal, ambitions, brodetsky, was, chaim, weizman, s, principal, ally, and, supporter, in, britain, weizmann, secured, for, norman, a, desirable, but, minor, position, with, the, british, economic, and, scientific, mission, in, washington, d, c, in, late, august, 1946, shortly, after, arriving, in, washington, he, learned, that, his, family, had, perished, norman, had, re, established, contact, with, his, old, nanny, in, vienna, wuth, who, told, him, what, happened, norman, became, deeply, depressed, over, the, fate, of, his, family, and, his, inability, to, help, the, jewish, people, languishing, in, the, european, camps, unable, to, endure, his, suffering, any, further, he, jumped, to, his, death, from, the, massachusetts, avenue, bridge, in, washington, d, c, on, 26, november, 1946, norman, was, buried, by, the, jewish, agency, in, washington, d, c, his, tombstone, read, simply, stephen, theodore, norman, captain, royal, artillery, british, army, grandson, of, theodor, herzl, 21, april, 1918, 26, november, 1946, norman, was, the, only, descendant, of, herzl, to, have, been, a, zionist, been, to, palestine, and, openly, stated, his, desire, to, return, on, 5, december, 2007, sixty, one, years, after, his, death, he, was, reburied, with, his, family, on, mt, herzl, in, the, plot, for, zionist, leaders, the, stephen, norman, garden, on, mount, herzl, in, jerusalem, the, only, memorial, in, the, world, to, a, herzl, other, than, theodor, herzl, was, dedicated, on, 2, may, 2012, by, the, jerusalem, foundation, and, the, jewish, american, society, for, historic, preservation, beginning, in, late, 1895, herzl, wrote, der, judenstaat, the, state, of, the, jews, the, small, book, was, initially, published, 14, february, 1896, in, leipzig, germany, and, vienna, austria, by, m, breitenstein, s, verlags, buchhandlung, it, is, subtitled, versuch, einer, modernen, l, sung, der, judenfrage, proposal, of, a, modern, solution, for, the, jewish, question, der, judenstaat, proposed, the, structure, and, beliefs, of, what, political, zionism, was, herzl, s, solution, was, the, creation, of, a, jewish, state, in, the, book, he, outlined, his, reasoning, for, the, need, to, reestablish, the, historic, jewish, state, the, idea, i, have, developed, in, this, pamphlet, is, an, ancient, one, it, is, the, restoration, of, the, jewish, state, the, decisive, factor, is, our, propelling, force, and, what, is, that, force, the, plight, of, the, jews, i, am, profoundly, convinced, that, i, am, right, though, i, doubt, whether, i, shall, live, to, see, myself, proved, so, those, who, today, inaugurate, this, movement, are, unlikely, to, live, to, see, its, glorious, culmination, but, the, very, inauguration, is, enough, to, inspire, in, them, a, high, pride, and, the, joy, of, an, inner, liberation, of, their, existence, the, plan, would, seem, mad, enough, if, a, single, individual, were, to, undertake, it, but, if, many, jews, simultaneously, agree, on, it, it, is, entirely, reasonable, and, its, achievement, presents, no, difficulties, worth, mentioning, the, idea, depends, only, on, the, number, of, its, adherents, perhaps, our, ambitious, young, men, to, whom, every, road, of, advancement, is, now, closed, and, for, whom, the, jewish, state, throws, open, a, bright, prospect, of, freedom, happiness, and, honor, perhaps, they, will, see, to, it, that, this, idea, is, spread, it, depends, on, the, jews, themselves, whether, this, political, document, remains, for, the, present, a, political, romance, if, this, generation, is, too, dull, to, understand, it, rightly, a, future, finer, more, advanced, generation, will, arise, to, comprehend, it, the, jews, who, will, try, it, shall, achieve, their, state, and, they, will, deserve, it, i, consider, the, jewish, question, neither, a, social, nor, a, religious, one, even, though, it, sometimes, takes, these, and, other, forms, it, is, a, national, question, and, to, solve, it, we, must, first, of, all, establish, it, as, an, international, political, problem, to, be, discussed, and, settled, by, the, civilized, nations, of, the, world, in, council, we, are, a, people, one, people, we, have, sincerely, tried, everywhere, to, merge, with, the, national, communities, in, which, we, live, seeking, only, to, preserve, the, faith, of, our, fathers, it, is, not, permitted, us, in, vain, are, we, loyal, patriots, sometimes, superloyal, in, vain, do, we, make, the, same, sacrifices, of, life, and, property, as, our, fellow, citizens, in, vain, do, we, strive, to, enhance, the, fame, of, our, native, lands, in, the, arts, and, sciences, or, her, wealth, by, trade, and, commerce, in, our, native, lands, where, we, have, lived, for, centuries, we, are, still, decried, as, aliens, often, by, men, whose, ancestors, had, not, yet, come, at, a, time, when, jewish, sighs, had, long, been, heard, in, the, country, oppression, and, persecution, cannot, exterminate, us, no, nation, on, earth, has, endured, such, struggles, and, sufferings, as, we, have, jew, baiting, has, merely, winnowed, out, our, weaklings, the, strong, among, us, defiantly, return, to, their, own, whenever, persecution, breaks, out, wherever, we, remain, politically, secure, for, any, length, of, time, we, assimilate, i, think, this, is, not, praiseworthy, palestine, is, our, unforgettable, historic, homeland, let, me, repeat, once, more, my, opening, words, the, jews, who, will, it, shall, achieve, their, state, we, shall, live, at, last, as, free, men, on, our, own, soil, and, in, our, own, homes, peacefully, die, the, world, will, be, liberated, by, our, freedom, enriched, by, our, wealth, magnified, by, our, greatness, and, whatever, we, attempt, there, for, our, own, benefit, will, redound, mightily, and, beneficially, to, the, good, of, all, mankind, his, last, literary, work, altneuland, in, english, the, old, new, land, 1902, is, a, novel, devoted, to, zionism, herzl, occupied, his, free, time, for, three, years, in, writing, what, he, believed, might, be, accomplished, by, 1923, though, the, form, is, that, of, a, romance, it, is, less, a, novel, than, a, serious, forecast, of, what, could, be, done, within, one, generation, the, keynotes, of, the, story, are, love, of, zion, and, insistence, upon, the, fact, that, the, suggested, changes, in, life, are, not, utopian, but, to, be, brought, about, simply, by, grouping, all, the, best, efforts, and, ideals, of, every, race, and, nation, each, such, effort, is, quoted, and, referred, to, in, such, a, manner, as, to, show, that, altneuland, though, blossoming, through, the, skill, of, the, jew, will, in, reality, be, the, product, of, the, benevolent, efforts, of, all, the, members, of, the, human, family, herzl, envisioned, a, jewish, state, that, combined, modern, jewish, culture, with, the, best, of, the, european, heritage, thus, a, palace, of, peace, would, be, built, in, jerusalem, to, arbitrate, international, disputes, and, at, the, same, time, the, temple, would, be, rebuilt, on, modern, principles, herzl, did, not, envision, the, jewish, inhabitants, of, the, state, as, being, religious, but, there, was, respect, for, religion, in, the, public, sphere, he, also, assumed, that, many, languages, would, be, spoken, and, that, hebrew, would, not, be, the, main, tongue, proponents, of, a, jewish, cultural, rebirth, such, as, ahad, ha, am, were, critical, of, altneuland, in, altneuland, herzl, did, not, foresee, any, conflict, between, jews, and, arabs, one, of, the, main, characters, in, altneuland, is, a, haifa, engineer, reshid, bey, who, is, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, new, society, he, is, very, grateful, to, his, jewish, neighbors, for, improving, the, economic, condition, of, palestine, and, sees, no, cause, for, conflict, all, non, jews, have, equal, rights, and, an, attempt, by, a, fanatical, rabbi, to, disenfranchise, the, non, jewish, citizens, of, their, rights, fails, in, the, election, which, is, the, center, of, the, main, political, plot, of, the, novel, herzl, also, envisioned, the, future, jewish, state, to, be, a, third, way, between, capitalism, and, socialism, with, a, developed, welfare, program, and, public, ownership, of, the, main, natural, resources, industry, agriculture, and, trade, were, organized, on, a, cooperative, basis, along, with, many, other, progressive, jews, of, the, day, such, as, emma, lazarus, louis, brandeis, albert, einstein, and, franz, oppenheimer, herzl, desired, to, enact, the, land, reforms, proposed, by, the, american, political, economist, henry, george, specifically, they, called, for, a, land, value, tax, he, called, his, mixed, economic, model, mutualism, a, term, derived, from, french, utopian, socialist, thinking, women, would, have, equal, voting, rights, as, they, had, in, the, zionist, movement, from, the, second, zionist, congress, onwards, in, altneuland, herzl, outlined, his, vision, for, a, new, jewish, state, in, palestine, he, summed, up, his, vision, of, an, open, society, it, is, founded, on, the, ideas, which, are, a, common, product, of, all, civilized, nations, it, would, be, immoral, if, we, would, exclude, anyone, whatever, his, origin, his, descent, or, his, religion, from, participating, in, our, achievements, for, we, stand, on, the, shoulders, of, other, civilized, peoples, what, we, own, we, owe, to, the, preparatory, work, of, other, peoples, therefore, we, have, to, repay, our, debt, there, is, only, one, way, to, do, it, the, highest, tolerance, our, motto, must, therefore, be, now, and, ever, man, you, are, my, brother, if, you, will, it, it, is, no, dream, a, phrase, from, herzl, s, book, old, new, land, became, a, popular, slogan, of, the, zionist, movement, the, striving, for, a, jewish, national, home, in, israel, in, his, novel, herzl, wrote, about, an, electoral, campaign, in, the, new, state, he, directed, his, wrath, against, the, nationalist, party, which, wished, to, make, the, jews, a, privileged, class, in, palestine, herzl, regarded, that, as, a, betrayal, of, zion, for, zion, was, identical, to, him, with, humanitarianism, and, tolerance, and, that, this, was, true, in, politics, as, well, as, religion, herzl, wrote, matters, of, faith, were, once, and, for, all, excluded, from, public, influence, whether, anyone, sought, religious, devotion, in, the, synagogue, in, the, church, in, the, mosque, in, the, art, museum, or, in, a, philharmonic, concert, did, not, concern, society, that, was, his, private, affair, altneuland, was, written, both, for, jews, and, non, jews, herzl, wanted, to, win, over, non, jewish, opinion, for, zionism, when, he, was, still, thinking, of, argentina, as, a, possible, venue, for, massive, jewish, immigration, he, wrote, in, his, diary, when, we, occupy, the, land, we, shall, bring, immediate, benefits, to, the, state, that, receives, us, we, must, expropriate, gently, the, private, property, on, the, estates, assigned, to, us, we, shall, try, to, spirit, the, penniless, population, across, the, border, by, procuring, employment, for, it, in, the, transit, countries, while, denying, it, any, employment, in, our, country, the, property, owners, will, come, over, to, our, side, both, the, process, of, expropriation, and, the, removal, of, the, poor, must, be, carried, out, discretely, and, circumspectly, it, goes, without, saying, that, we, shall, respectfully, tolerate, persons, of, other, faiths, and, protect, their, property, their, honor, and, their, freedom, with, the, harshest, means, of, coercion, this, is, another, area, in, which, we, shall, set, the, entire, world, a, wonderful, example, should, there, be, many, such, immovable, owners, in, individual, areas, we, shall, simply, leave, them, there, and, develop, our, commerce, in, the, direction, of, other, areas, which, belong, to, us, herzl, s, draft, of, a, charter, for, a, jewish, ottoman, land, company, jolc, gave, the, jolc, the, right, to, obtain, land, in, palestine, by, giving, its, owners, comparable, land, elsewhere, in, the, ottoman, empire, the, name, tel, aviv, was, the, title, given, to, the, hebrew, translation, of, altneuland, by, the, translator, nahum, sokolow, this, name, comes, from, ezekiel, 3, 15, and, means, tell, an, ancient, mound, formed, when, a, town, is, built, on, its, own, debris, for, thousands, of, years, of, spring, the, name, was, later, applied, to, the, new, town, built, outside, jaffa, that, became, tel, aviv, yafo, the, second, largest, city, in, israel, the, nearby, city, to, the, north, herzliya, was, named, in, honour, of, herzl, i, flatter, myself, to, think, that, i, need, not, speak, of, my, feelings, towards, your, people, as, far, as, the, israelites, are, concerned, i, really, do, regard, them, as, relatives, of, us, arabs, for, us, they, are, cousins, we, really, do, have, the, same, father, abraham, from, whom, we, are, also, descended, there, are, a, lot, of, affinities, between, the, two, races, we, have, almost, the, same, language, politically, moreover, i, am, convinced, that, the, jews, and, arabs, will, do, well, to, support, each, other, if, they, are, to, resist, the, invaders, of, other, races, it, is, these, sentiments, that, put, me, at, ease, to, speak, frankly, to, you, about, the, great, question, that, is, currently, agitating, your, people, you, are, well, aware, that, i, am, talking, about, zionism, the, idea, in, itself, is, only, natural, beautiful, and, just, who, can, dispute, the, rights, of, the, jews, to, palestine, my, god, historically, it, is, your, country, and, what, a, marvellous, spectacle, it, would, be, if, the, jews, so, gifted, were, once, again, reconstituted, as, an, independent, nation, respected, happy, able, to, render, services, to, poor, humanity, in, the, moral, domain, as, in, the, past, unfortunately, the, destinies, of, nations, are, not, governed, solely, by, these, abstract, conceptions, however, pure, however, noble, they, may, be, we, must, reckon, with, reality, with, established, facts, with, force, yes, with, the, brutal, force, of, circumstances, but, the, reality, is, that, palestine, is, now, an, integral, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, what, is, more, serious, it, is, inhabited, by, people, other, than, only, israelites, this, reality, these, acquired, facts, this, brutal, force, of, circumstances, leave, zionism, geographically, no, hope, of, realisation, excerpts, from, the, letter, from, yusuf, diya, al, khalidi, to, theodor, herzl, dated, march, 1, 1899, the, zionist, idea, of, which, i, am, the, humble, servant, has, no, hostile, tendency, toward, the, ottoman, government, but, quite, to, the, contrary, this, movement, is, concerned, with, opening, up, new, resources, for, the, ottoman, empire, in, allowing, immigration, to, a, number, of, jews, bringing, their, intelligence, their, financial, acumen, and, their, means, of, enterprise, to, the, country, no, one, can, doubt, that, the, well, being, of, the, entire, country, would, be, the, happy, result, it, is, necessary, to, understand, this, and, make, it, known, to, everybody, as, your, excellency, said, very, well, in, your, letter, to, the, grand, rabbi, the, jews, have, no, belligerent, power, behind, them, neither, are, they, themselves, of, a, warlike, nature, they, are, a, completely, peaceful, element, and, very, content, if, they, are, left, in, peace, therefore, there, is, absolutely, nothing, to, fear, from, their, immigration, the, question, of, the, holy, places, but, no, one, thinks, of, ever, touching, those, as, i, have, said, and, written, many, times, these, places, have, lost, forever, the, faculty, of, belonging, exclusively, to, one, faith, to, one, race, or, to, one, people, the, holy, places, are, and, will, remain, holy, for, all, the, world, for, the, moslems, as, for, the, christians, as, for, the, jews, the, universal, peace, which, all, men, of, good, will, ardently, hope, for, will, have, its, symbol, in, a, brotherly, union, in, the, holy, places, you, see, another, difficulty, excellency, in, the, existence, of, the, non, jewish, population, in, palestine, but, who, would, think, of, sending, them, away, it, is, their, well, being, their, individual, wealth, which, we, will, increase, by, bringing, in, our, own, do, you, think, that, an, arab, who, owns, land, or, a, house, in, palestine, worth, three, or, four, thousand, francs, will, be, very, angry, to, see, the, price, of, his, land, rise, in, a, short, time, to, see, it, rise, five, and, ten, times, in, value, perhaps, in, a, few, months, moreover, that, will, necessarily, happen, with, the, arrival, of, the, jews, that, is, what, the, indigenous, population, must, realize, that, they, will, gain, excellent, brothers, as, the, sultan, will, gain, faithful, and, good, subjects, who, will, make, this, province, flourish, this, province, which, is, their, historic, homeland, excerpts, from, the, letter, from, theodor, herzl, to, yusuf, diya, uddin, al, khalidi, dated, 19, march, 1899
