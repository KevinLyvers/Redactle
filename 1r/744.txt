islamic, philosopher, and, music, theorist, he, has, been, designated, as, father, of, islamic, neoplatonism, and, the, founder, of, islamic, political, philosophy, al, farabi, s, fields, of, philosophical, interest, included, but, not, limited, to, philosophy, of, society, and, religion, philosophy, of, language, and, logic, psychology, and, epistemology, metaphysics, political,

mathematics, cosmology, and, physics, al, farabi, is, credited, as, the, first, muslim, who, presented, philosophy, as, a, coherent, system, in, the, islamic, world, and, created, a, philosophical, system, of, his, own, which, developed, a, philosophical, system, that, went, far, beyond, the, scholastic, interests, of, his, greco, roman, neoplatonism, and, syriac, aristotelian, precursors, that, he, was, more, than, a, pioneer, in, islamic, philosophy, can, be, deduced, from, the, habit, of, later, writers, calling, him, the, second, master, with, aristotle, as, the, first, al, farabi, s, impact, on, philosophy, is, undeniable, to, name, a, few, yahya, ibn, adi, abu, sulayman, sijistani, abu, al, hassan, al, amiri, and, abu, hayyan, al, tawhidi, avicenna, suhrawardi, and, mulla, sadra,

basic, accounts, of, al, farabi, s, origins, and, pedigree, indicate, that, they, were, not, recorded, during, his, lifetime, or, soon, thereafter, by, anyone, with, concrete, information, but, were, based, on, hearsay, or, guesses, as, is, the, case, with, other, contemporaries, of, al, farabi, little, is, known, about, his, life, early, sources, include, an, autobiographical, passage, where, al, farabi, traces, the, history, of, logic, and, philosophy, up, to, his, time, and, brief, mentions, by, al, masudi, ibn, al, nadim, and, ibn, hawqal, said, al, andalusi, wrote, a, biography, of, al, farabi, arabic, biographers, of, the, 12th, 13th, centuries, thus, had, few, facts, to, hand, and, used, invented, stories, about, his, life, from, incidental, accounts, it, is, known, that, he, spent, significant, time, most, of, his, scholarly, life, in, baghdad, with, syriac, christian, scholars, including, the, cleric, yuhanna, ibn, haylan, yahya, ibn, adi, and, abu, ishaq, ibrahim, al, baghdadi, he, later, spent, time, in, damascus, and, in, egypt, before, returning, to, damascus, where, he, died, in, 950, 1, his, name, was, abu, nasr, muhammad, ibn, muhammad, al, farabi, sometimes, with, the, family, surname, al, tarkhani, i, e, the, element, tarkhan, appears, in, a, nisba, his, grandfather, was, not, known, among, his, contemporaries, but, a, name, awzalagh, in, arabic, suddenly, appears, later, in, the, writings, of, ibn, abi, usaybi, a, and, of, his, great, grandfather, in, those, of, ibn, khallikan, his, birthplace, could, have, been, any, one, of, the, many, places, in, central, asia, then, known, by, the, name, of, khurasan, the, word, farab, is, a, persian, term, for, a, locale, that, is, irrigated, by, effluent, springs, or, flows, from, a, nearby, river, thus, there, are, many, places, that, carry, the, name, or, various, evolutions, of, that, hydrological, geological, toponym, in, that, general, area, such, as, farab, otrar, on, the, jaxartes, syr, darya, in, modern, kazakhstan, farab, an, still, extant, village, in, suburbs, of, the, city, of, chaharjuy, amul, modern, t, rkmenabat, on, the, oxus, amu, darya, in, turkmenistan, on, the, silk, road, connecting, merv, to, bukhara, or, faryab, in, greater, khorasan, modern, day, afghanistan, the, older, persian, parab, in, hudud, ul, alam, or, faryab, also, paryab, is, a, common, persian, toponym, meaning, lands, irrigated, by, diversion, of, river, water, while, scholars, largely, agree, that, his, ethnic, background, is, not, knowable, al, farabi, has, also, been, described, as, being, of, either, persian, or, turkic, origin, medieval, arab, historian, ibn, abi, usaibia, died, in, 1270, one, of, al, farabi, s, oldest, biographer, mentions, in, his, uyun, that, al, farabi, s, father, was, of, persian, descent, al, shahrazuri, who, lived, around, 1288, and, has, written, an, early, biography, also, states, that, al, farabi, hailed, from, a, persian, family, according, to, majid, fakhry, an, emeritus, professor, of, philosophy, at, georgetown, university, al, farabi, s, father, was, an, army, captain, of, persian, extraction, a, persian, origin, has, been, stated, by, many, other, sources, as, well, dimitri, gutas, notes, that, farabi, s, works, contain, references, and, glosses, in, persian, sogdian, and, even, greek, but, not, turkish, sogdian, has, also, been, suggested, as, his, native, language, and, the, language, of, the, inhabitants, of, farab, muhammad, javad, mashkoor, argues, for, an, iranian, speaking, central, asian, origin, according, to, christoph, baumer, he, was, probably, a, sogdian, according, to, th, r, se, anne, druart, writing, in, 2020, scholars, have, disputed, his, ethnic, origin, some, claimed, he, was, turkish, but, more, recent, research, points, to, him, being, a, persian, the, oldest, known, reference, to, a, turkic, origin, is, given, by, the, medieval, historian, ibn, khallikan, died, in, 1282, who, in, his, work, wafayat, completed, in, 669, 1271, states, that, al, farabi, was, born, in, the, small, village, of, wasij, near, farab, in, what, is, today, otrar, kazakhstan, of, turkic, parents, based, on, this, account, some, scholars, say, he, is, of, turkic, origin, dimitri, gutas, an, american, arabist, criticizes, this, saying, that, ibn, khallikan, s, account, is, aimed, at, the, earlier, historical, accounts, by, ibn, abi, usaybi, a, and, serves, the, purpose, to, prove, a, turkic, origin, for, al, farabi, for, instance, by, mentioning, the, additional, nisba, surname, al, turk, arab, the, turk, a, nisba, al, farabi, never, had, however, abu, al, feda, who, copied, ibn, khallekan, corrected, this, and, changed, al, tork, to, the, phrase, wa, kana, rajolan, torkiyan, meaning, he, was, a, turkish, man, in, this, regard, since, works, of, such, supposed, turks, lack, traces, of, turkic, nomadic, culture, oxford, professor, c, e, bosworth, notes, that, great, figures, as, farabi, biruni, and, avicenna, have, been, attached, by, over, enthusiastic, turkish, scholars, to, their, race, al, farabi, spent, most, of, his, scholarly, life, in, baghdad, in, the, autobiographical, passage, preserved, by, ibn, abi, usaybi, a, al, farabi, stated, that, he, had, studied, logic, medicine, and, sociology, with, yuhanna, ibn, haylan, up, to, and, including, aristotle, s, posterior, analytics, i, e, according, to, the, order, of, the, books, studied, in, the, curriculum, al, farabi, was, claiming, that, he, had, studied, porphyry, s, eisagoge, and, aristotle, s, categories, de, interpretatione, prior, and, posterior, analytics, his, teacher, yuhanna, bin, haylan, was, a, nestorian, cleric, this, period, of, study, was, probably, in, baghdad, where, al, mas, udi, records, that, yuhanna, died, during, the, reign, of, al, muqtadir, 295, 320, 908, 32, in, his, appearance, of, philosophy, f, uh, r, al, falsafa, al, farabi, tells, us, philosophy, as, an, academic, subject, became, widespread, in, the, days, of, the, ptolemaic, kings, of, the, greeks, after, the, death, of, aristotle, in, alexandria, until, the, end, of, the, woman, s, reign, the, teaching, of, it, continued, unchanged, in, alexandria, after, the, death, of, aristotle, through, the, reign, of, thirteen, kings, thus, it, went, until, the, coming, of, christianity, then, the, teaching, came, to, an, end, in, rome, while, it, continued, in, alexandria, until, the, king, of, the, christians, looked, into, the, matter, the, bishops, assembled, and, took, counsel, together, on, which, parts, of, teaching, were, to, be, left, in, place, and, which, were, to, be, discontinued, they, formed, the, opinion, that, the, books, on, logic, were, to, be, taught, up, to, the, end, of, the, assertoric, figures, but, not, what, comes, after, it, since, they, thought, that, would, harm, christianity, teaching, the, rest, remained, private, until, the, coming, of, islam, when, the, teaching, was, transferred, from, alexandria, to, antioch, there, it, remained, for, a, long, time, until, only, one, teacher, was, left, two, men, learned, from, him, and, they, left, taking, the, books, with, them, one, of, them, was, from, harran, the, other, from, marw, as, for, the, man, from, marw, two, men, learned, from, him, ibrahim, al, marwazi, and, yuhanna, ibn, haylan, he, was, in, baghdad, at, least, until, the, end, of, september, 942, as, recorded, in, notes, in, his, mab, de, r, ahl, al, mad, na, al, f, ela, he, finished, the, book, in, damascus, the, following, year, 331, i, e, by, september, 943, he, also, lived, and, taught, for, some, time, in, aleppo, al, farabi, later, visited, egypt, finishing, six, sections, summarizing, the, book, mab, de, in, egypt, in, 337, july, 948, june, 949, when, he, returned, to, syria, where, he, was, supported, by, sayf, al, dawla, the, hamdanid, ruler, al, mas, udi, writing, barely, five, years, after, the, fact, 955, 6, the, date, of, the, composition, of, the, tanb, h, says, that, al, farabi, died, in, damascus, in, rajab, 339, between, 14, december, 950, and, 12, january, 951, al, farabi, s, religious, affiliation, within, islam, is, disputed, while, some, historians, identify, him, as, sunni, some, others, assert, he, was, shia, or, influenced, by, shia, fauzi, najjar, argues, that, al, farabi, s, political, philosophy, was, influenced, by, shiite, sects, giving, a, positive, account, nadia, maftouni, describes, shi, ite, aspects, of, al, farabi, s, writings, as, she, put, it, al, farabi, in, his, al, millah, al, siyasah, al, madaniyah, and, tahsil, al, sa, adah, believes, in, a, utopia, governed, by, prophet, and, his, successors, the, imams, al, farabi, made, contributions, to, the, fields, of, logic, mathematics, music, philosophy, psychology, and, education, al, farabi, wrote, the, necessity, of, the, art, of, the, elixir, though, he, was, mainly, an, aristotelian, logician, he, included, a, number, of, non, aristotelian, elements, in, his, works, he, discussed, the, topics, of, future, contingents, the, number, and, relation, of, the, categories, the, relation, between, logic, and, grammar, and, non, aristotelian, forms, of, inference, he, is, also, credited, with, categorizing, logic, into, two, separate, groups, the, first, being, idea, and, the, second, being, proof, al, farabi, also, considered, the, theories, of, conditional, syllogisms, and, analogical, inference, which, were, part, of, the, stoic, tradition, of, logic, rather, than, the, aristotelian, another, addition, al, farabi, made, to, the, aristotelian, tradition, was, his, introduction, of, the, concept, of, poetic, syllogism, in, a, commentary, on, aristotle, s, poetics, al, farabi, wrote, a, book, on, music, titled, kitab, al, musiqi, al, kabir, grand, book, of, music, in, it, he, presents, philosophical, principles, about, music, its, cosmic, qualities, and, its, influences, and, discusses, the, therapeutic, effects, of, music, on, the, soul, he, moreover, talks, about, its, impact, on, speech, clarifying, how, actually, to, fit, music, to, speech, i, e, poetry, in, arrange, to, upgrade, the, meaning, of, a, text, as, a, philosopher, al, farabi, was, a, founder, of, his, own, school, of, early, islamic, philosophy, known, as, farabism, or, alfarabism, though, it, was, later, overshadowed, by, avicennism, al, farabi, s, school, of, philosophy, breaks, with, the, philosophy, of, plato, and, aristotle, moves, from, metaphysics, to, methodology, a, move, that, anticipates, modernity, and, at, the, level, of, philosophy, farabi, unites, theory, and, practice, in, the, sphere, of, the, political, he, liberates, practice, from, theory, his, neoplatonic, theology, is, also, more, than, just, metaphysics, as, rhetoric, in, his, attempt, to, think, through, the, nature, of, a, first, cause, farabi, discovers, the, limits, of, human, knowledge, al, farabi, had, great, influence, on, science, and, philosophy, for, several, centuries, and, was, widely, considered, second, only, to, aristotle, in, knowledge, alluded, to, by, his, title, of, the, second, teacher, in, his, time, his, work, aimed, at, synthesis, of, philosophy, and, sufism, paved, the, way, for, the, work, of, avicenna, al, farabi, also, wrote, a, commentary, on, aristotle, s, work, and, one, of, his, most, notable, works, is, ara, ahl, al, madina, al, fadila, where, he, theorized, an, ideal, state, supposedly, modelled, on, plato, s, the, republic, al, farabi, argued, that, religion, rendered, truth, through, symbols, and, persuasion, and, like, plato, saw, it, as, the, duty, of, the, philosopher, to, provide, guidance, to, the, state, al, farabi, incorporated, the, platonic, view, drawing, a, parallel, from, within, the, islamic, context, in, that, he, regarded, the, ideal, state, to, be, ruled, by, the, prophet, imam, instead, of, the, philosopher, king, envisaged, by, plato, al, farabi, argued, that, the, ideal, state, was, the, city, state, of, medina, when, it, was, governed, by, muhammad, as, its, head, of, state, as, he, was, in, direct, communion, with, allah, whose, law, was, revealed, to, him, in, the, absence, of, the, prophet, imam, al, farabi, considered, democracy, as, the, closest, to, the, ideal, state, regarding, the, order, of, the, sunni, rashidun, caliphate, as, an, example, of, such, a, republican, order, within, early, muslim, history, however, he, also, maintained, that, it, was, from, democracy, that, imperfect, states, emerged, noting, how, the, order, of, the, early, islamic, caliphate, of, the, rashidun, caliphs, which, he, viewed, as, republican, was, later, replaced, by, a, form, of, government, resembling, a, monarchy, under, the, umayyad, and, abbasid, dynasties, al, farabi, wrote, a, short, treatise, on, vacuum, where, he, thought, about, the, nature, of, the, existence, of, void, his, final, conclusion, was, that, air, s, volume, can, expand, to, fill, available, space, and, he, suggested, that, the, concept, of, perfect, vacuum, was, incoherent, in, his, opinions, of, the, people, of, the, ideal, city, al, farabi, expressed, that, a, separated, person, may, not, accomplish, all, the, idealizations, by, himself, without, the, help, of, other, people, it, is, the, intrinsic, mien, of, each, man, to, connect, another, human, being, or, other, men, within, the, labor, he, has, to, be, performed, subsequently, to, realize, what, he, can, of, that, flawlessness, each, man, must, remain, within, the, neighborhood, of, others, and, relate, with, them, in, chapter, 24, of, aforementioned, text, on, the, cause, of, dreams, he, distinguished, between, dream, interpretation, and, the, nature, and, causes, of, dreams, the, main, influence, on, al, farabi, s, philosophy, was, the, aristotelian, tradition, of, alexandria, a, prolific, writer, he, is, credited, with, over, one, hundred, works, amongst, these, are, a, number, of, prolegomena, to, philosophy, commentaries, on, important, aristotelian, works, such, as, the, nicomachean, ethics, as, well, as, his, own, works, his, ideas, are, marked, by, their, coherency, despite, drawing, together, of, many, different, philosophical, disciplines, and, traditions, some, other, significant, influences, on, his, work, were, the, planetary, model, of, ptolemy, and, elements, of, neo, platonism, particularly, metaphysics, and, practical, or, political, philosophy, which, bears, more, resemblance, to, plato, s, republic, than, aristotle, s, politics, in, the, handing, down, of, aristotle, s, thought, to, the, christian, west, in, the, middle, ages, al, farabi, played, an, essential, part, as, appears, in, the, translation, of, al, farabi, s, commentary, and, short, treatise, on, aristotle, s, de, interpretatione, that, f, w, zimmermann, published, in, 1981, al, farabi, had, a, great, influence, on, maimonides, the, most, important, jewish, thinker, of, the, middle, ages, maimonides, wrote, in, arabic, the, celebrated, maqala, fi, sina, at, al, mantiq, treatise, on, logic, in, a, wonderfully, concise, way, the, work, treats, of, the, essentials, of, aristotelian, logic, in, the, light, of, comments, made, by, the, persian, philosophers, avicenna, and, above, all, al, farabi, r, mi, brague, in, his, book, devoted, to, the, treatise, stresses, the, fact, that, al, farabi, is, the, only, thinker, mentioned, therein, al, farabi, as, well, as, avicenna, and, averroes, have, been, recognized, as, peripatetics, al, mashsha, iyu, n, or, rationalists, estedlaliun, among, muslims, however, he, tried, to, gather, the, ideas, of, plato, and, aristotle, in, his, book, harmonization, of, the, opinion, of, the, two, sage, according, to, reisman, his, work, was, singularly, directed, towards, the, goal, of, simultaneously, reviving, and, reinventing, the, alexandrian, philosophical, tradition, to, which, his, christian, teacher, yuhanna, ibn, haylan, belonged, his, success, should, be, measured, by, the, honorific, title, of, the, second, master, of, philosophy, aristotle, being, the, first, by, which, he, was, known, reisman, also, says, that, he, does, not, make, any, reference, to, the, ideas, of, either, al, kindi, or, his, contemporary, rhazes, which, clearly, indicates, that, he, did, not, consider, their, approach, to, philosophy, as, a, correct, or, viable, one, in, contrast, to, al, kindi, who, considered, the, subject, of, metaphysics, to, be, god, al, farabi, believed, that, it, was, concerned, primarily, with, being, qua, being, that, is, being, in, and, of, itself, and, this, is, related, to, god, only, to, the, extent, that, god, is, a, principle, of, absolute, being, al, kindi, s, view, was, however, a, common, misconception, regarding, greek, philosophy, amongst, muslim, intellectuals, at, the, time, and, it, was, for, this, reason, that, avicenna, remarked, that, he, did, not, understand, aristotle, s, metaphysics, properly, until, he, had, read, a, prolegomenon, written, by, al, farabi, al, farabi, s, cosmology, is, essentially, based, upon, three, pillars, aristotelian, metaphysics, of, causation, highly, developed, plotinian, emanational, cosmology, and, the, ptolemaic, astronomy, in, his, model, the, universe, is, viewed, as, a, number, of, concentric, circles, the, outermost, sphere, or, first, heaven, the, sphere, of, fixed, stars, saturn, jupiter, mars, the, sun, venus, mercury, and, finally, the, moon, at, the, centre, of, these, concentric, circles, is, the, sub, lunar, realm, which, contains, the, material, world, each, of, these, circles, represent, the, domain, of, the, secondary, intelligences, symbolized, by, the, celestial, bodies, themselves, which, act, as, causal, intermediaries, between, the, first, cause, in, this, case, god, and, the, material, world, furthermore, these, are, said, to, have, emanated, from, god, who, is, both, their, formal, and, efficient, cause, the, process, of, emanation, begins, metaphysically, not, temporally, with, the, first, cause, whose, principal, activity, is, self, contemplation, and, it, is, this, intellectual, activity, that, underlies, its, role, in, the, creation, of, the, universe, the, first, cause, by, thinking, of, itself, overflows, and, the, incorporeal, entity, of, the, second, intellect, emanates, from, it, like, its, predecessor, the, second, intellect, also, thinks, about, itself, and, thereby, brings, its, celestial, sphere, in, this, case, the, sphere, of, fixed, stars, into, being, but, in, addition, to, this, it, must, also, contemplate, upon, the, first, cause, and, this, causes, the, emanation, of, the, next, intellect, the, cascade, of, emanation, continues, until, it, reaches, the, tenth, intellect, beneath, which, is, the, material, world, and, as, each, intellect, must, contemplate, both, itself, and, an, increasing, number, of, predecessors, each, succeeding, level, of, existence, becomes, more, and, more, complex, this, process, is, based, upon, necessity, as, opposed, to, will, in, other, words, god, does, not, have, a, choice, whether, or, not, to, create, the, universe, but, by, virtue, of, his, own, existence, he, causes, it, to, be, this, view, also, suggests, that, the, universe, is, eternal, and, both, of, these, points, were, criticized, by, al, ghazzali, in, his, attack, on, the, philosophers, in, his, discussion, of, the, first, cause, or, god, al, farabi, relies, heavily, on, negative, theology, he, says, that, it, cannot, be, known, by, intellectual, means, such, as, dialectical, division, or, definition, because, the, terms, used, in, these, processes, to, define, a, thing, constitute, its, substance, therefore, if, one, was, to, define, the, first, cause, each, of, the, terms, used, would, actually, constitute, a, part, of, its, substance, and, therefore, behave, as, a, cause, for, its, existence, which, is, impossible, as, the, first, cause, is, uncaused, it, exists, without, being, caused, equally, he, says, it, cannot, be, known, according, to, genus, and, differentia, as, its, substance, and, existence, are, different, from, all, others, and, therefore, it, has, no, category, to, which, it, belongs, if, this, were, the, case, then, it, would, not, be, the, first, cause, because, something, would, be, prior, in, existence, to, it, which, is, also, impossible, this, would, suggest, that, the, more, philosophically, simple, a, thing, is, the, more, perfect, it, is, and, based, on, this, observation, reisman, says, it, is, possible, to, see, the, entire, hierarchy, of, al, farabi, s, cosmology, according, to, classification, into, genus, and, species, each, succeeding, level, in, this, structure, has, as, its, principal, qualities, multiplicity, and, deficiency, and, it, is, this, ever, increasing, complexity, that, typifies, the, material, world, human, beings, are, unique, in, al, farabi, s, vision, of, the, universe, because, they, stand, between, two, worlds, the, higher, immaterial, world, of, the, celestial, intellects, and, universal, intelligibles, and, the, lower, material, world, of, generation, and, decay, they, inhabit, a, physical, body, and, so, belong, to, the, lower, world, but, they, also, have, a, rational, capacity, which, connects, them, to, the, higher, realm, each, level, of, existence, in, al, farabi, s, cosmology, is, characterized, by, its, movement, towards, perfection, which, is, to, become, like, the, first, cause, i, e, a, perfect, intellect, human, perfection, or, happiness, then, is, equated, with, constant, intellection, and, contemplation, al, farabi, divides, intellect, into, four, categories, potential, actual, acquired, and, the, agent, the, first, three, are, the, different, states, of, the, human, intellect, and, the, fourth, is, the, tenth, intellect, the, moon, in, his, emanational, cosmology, the, potential, intellect, represents, the, capacity, to, think, which, is, shared, by, all, human, beings, and, the, actual, intellect, is, an, intellect, engaged, in, the, act, of, thinking, by, thinking, al, farabi, means, abstracting, universal, intelligibles, from, the, sensory, forms, of, objects, which, have, been, apprehended, and, retained, in, the, individual, s, imagination, this, motion, from, potentiality, to, actuality, requires, the, agent, intellect, to, act, upon, the, retained, sensory, forms, just, as, the, sun, illuminates, the, physical, world, to, allow, us, to, see, the, agent, intellect, illuminates, the, world, of, intelligibles, to, allow, us, to, think, this, illumination, removes, all, accident, such, as, time, place, quality, and, physicality, from, them, converting, them, into, primary, intelligibles, which, are, logical, principles, such, as, the, whole, is, greater, than, the, part, the, human, intellect, by, its, act, of, intellection, passes, from, potentiality, to, actuality, and, as, it, gradually, comprehends, these, intelligibles, it, is, identified, with, them, as, according, to, aristotle, by, knowing, something, the, intellect, becomes, like, it, because, the, agent, intellect, knows, all, of, the, intelligibles, this, means, that, when, the, human, intellect, knows, all, of, them, it, becomes, associated, with, the, agent, intellect, s, perfection, and, is, known, as, the, acquired, intellect, while, this, process, seems, mechanical, leaving, little, room, for, human, choice, or, volition, reisman, says, that, al, farabi, is, committed, to, human, voluntarism, this, takes, place, when, man, based, on, the, knowledge, he, has, acquired, decides, whether, to, direct, himself, towards, virtuous, or, unvirtuous, activities, and, thereby, decides, whether, or, not, to, seek, true, happiness, and, it, is, by, choosing, what, is, ethical, and, contemplating, about, what, constitutes, the, nature, of, ethics, that, the, actual, intellect, can, become, like, the, active, intellect, thereby, attaining, perfection, it, is, only, by, this, process, that, a, human, soul, may, survive, death, and, live, on, in, the, afterlife, according, to, al, farabi, the, afterlife, is, not, the, personal, experience, commonly, conceived, of, by, religious, traditions, such, as, islam, and, christianity, any, individual, or, distinguishing, features, of, the, soul, are, annihilated, after, the, death, of, the, body, only, the, rational, faculty, survives, and, then, only, if, it, has, attained, perfection, which, becomes, one, with, all, other, rational, souls, within, the, agent, intellect, and, enters, a, realm, of, pure, intelligence, henry, corbin, compares, this, eschatology, with, that, of, the, ismaili, neo, platonists, for, whom, this, process, initiated, the, next, grand, cycle, of, the, universe, however, deborah, black, mentions, we, have, cause, to, be, skeptical, as, to, whether, this, was, the, mature, and, developed, view, of, al, farabi, as, later, thinkers, such, as, ibn, tufayl, averroes, and, avempace, would, assert, that, he, repudiated, this, view, in, his, commentary, on, the, nicomachean, ethics, which, has, been, lost, to, modern, experts, in, his, treatment, of, the, human, soul, al, farabi, draws, on, a, basic, aristotelian, outline, which, is, informed, by, the, commentaries, of, later, greek, thinkers, he, says, it, is, composed, of, four, faculties, the, appetitive, the, desire, for, or, aversion, to, an, object, of, sense, the, sensitive, the, perception, by, the, senses, of, corporeal, substances, the, imaginative, the, faculty, which, retains, images, of, sensible, objects, after, they, have, been, perceived, and, then, separates, and, combines, them, for, a, number, of, ends, and, the, rational, which, is, the, faculty, of, intellection, it, is, the, last, of, these, which, is, unique, to, human, beings, and, distinguishes, them, from, plants, and, animals, it, is, also, the, only, part, of, the, soul, to, survive, the, death, of, the, body, noticeably, absent, from, these, scheme, are, internal, senses, such, as, common, sense, which, would, be, discussed, by, later, philosophers, such, as, avicenna, and, averroes, special, attention, must, be, given, to, al, farabi, s, treatment, of, the, soul, s, imaginative, faculty, which, is, essential, to, his, interpretation, of, prophethood, and, prophetic, knowledge, in, addition, to, its, ability, to, retain, and, manipulate, sensible, images, of, objects, he, gives, the, imagination, the, function, of, imitation, by, this, he, means, the, capacity, to, represent, an, object, with, an, image, other, than, its, own, in, other, words, to, imitate, x, is, to, imagine, x, by, associating, it, with, sensible, qualities, that, do, not, describe, its, own, appearance, this, extends, the, representative, ability, of, the, imagination, beyond, sensible, forms, and, to, include, temperaments, emotions, desires, and, even, immaterial, intelligibles, or, abstract, universals, as, happens, when, for, example, one, associates, evil, with, darkness, the, prophet, in, addition, to, his, own, intellectual, capacity, has, a, very, strong, imaginative, faculty, which, allows, him, to, receive, an, overflow, of, intelligibles, from, the, agent, intellect, the, tenth, intellect, in, the, emanational, cosmology, these, intelligibles, are, then, associated, with, symbols, and, images, which, allow, him, to, communicate, abstract, truths, in, a, way, that, can, be, understood, by, ordinary, people, therefore, what, makes, prophetic, knowledge, unique, is, not, its, content, which, is, also, accessible, to, philosophers, through, demonstration, and, intellection, but, rather, the, form, that, it, is, given, by, the, prophet, s, imagination, the, practical, application, of, philosophy, was, a, major, concern, expressed, by, al, farabi, in, many, of, his, works, and, while, the, majority, of, his, philosophical, output, has, been, influenced, by, aristotelian, thought, his, practical, philosophy, was, unmistakably, based, on, that, of, plato, in, a, similar, manner, to, plato, s, republic, al, farabi, emphasized, that, philosophy, was, both, a, theoretical, and, practical, discipline, labeling, those, philosophers, who, do, not, apply, their, erudition, to, practical, pursuits, as, futile, philosophers, the, ideal, society, he, wrote, is, one, directed, towards, the, realization, of, true, happiness, which, can, be, taken, to, mean, philosophical, enlightenment, and, as, such, the, ideal, philosopher, must, hone, all, the, necessary, arts, of, rhetoric, and, poetics, to, communicate, abstract, truths, to, the, ordinary, people, as, well, as, having, achieved, enlightenment, himself, al, farabi, compared, the, philosopher, s, role, in, relation, to, society, with, a, physician, in, relation, to, the, body, the, body, s, health, is, affected, by, the, balance, of, its, humours, just, as, the, city, is, determined, by, the, moral, habits, of, its, people, the, philosopher, s, duty, he, wrote, was, to, establish, a, virtuous, society, by, healing, the, souls, of, the, people, establishing, justice, and, guiding, them, towards, true, happiness, of, course, al, farabi, realized, that, such, a, society, was, rare, and, required, a, very, specific, set, of, historical, circumstances, to, be, realized, which, means, very, few, societies, could, ever, attain, this, goal, he, divided, those, vicious, societies, which, have, fallen, short, of, the, ideal, virtuous, society, into, three, categories, ignorant, wicked, and, errant, ignorant, societies, have, for, whatever, reason, failed, to, comprehend, the, purpose, of, human, existence, and, have, supplanted, the, pursuit, of, happiness, for, another, inferior, goal, whether, this, be, wealth, sensual, gratification, or, power, al, farabi, mentions, weeds, in, the, virtuous, society, those, people, who, try, to, undermine, its, progress, towards, the, true, human, end, the, best, known, arabic, source, for, al, farabi, s, political, philosophy, is, his, work, titled, ara, ahl, al, madina, al, fadila, although, some, consider, al, farabi, to, be, a, political, idealism, whether, or, not, al, farabi, actually, intended, to, outline, a, political, programme, in, his, writings, remains, a, matter, of, dispute, amongst, academics, henry, corbin, who, considers, al, farabi, to, be, a, crypto, shi, ite, says, that, his, ideas, should, be, understood, as, a, prophetic, philosophy, instead, of, being, interpreted, politically, on, the, other, hand, charles, butterworth, contends, that, nowhere, in, his, work, does, al, farabi, speak, of, a, prophet, legislator, or, revelation, even, the, word, philosophy, is, scarcely, mentioned, and, the, main, discussion, that, takes, place, concerns, the, positions, of, king, and, statesmen, occupying, a, middle, position, is, david, reisman, who, like, corbin, believes, that, al, farabi, did, not, want, to, expound, a, political, doctrine, although, he, does, not, go, so, far, to, attribute, it, to, islamic, gnosticism, either, he, argues, that, al, farabi, was, using, different, types, of, society, as, examples, in, the, context, of, an, ethical, discussion, to, show, what, effect, correct, or, incorrect, thinking, could, have, lastly, joshua, parens, argues, that, al, farabi, was, slyly, asserting, that, a, pan, islamic, society, could, not, be, made, by, using, reason, to, show, how, many, conditions, such, as, moral, and, deliberative, virtue, would, have, to, be, met, thus, leading, the, reader, to, conclude, that, humans, are, not, fit, for, such, a, society, some, other, authors, such, as, mykhaylo, yakubovych, argue, that, for, al, farabi, religion, milla, and, philosophy, falsafa, constituted, the, same, praxeological, value, i, e, basis, for, amal, al, fadhil, virtuous, deed, while, its, epistemological, level, ilm, knowledge, was, different, in, modern, turkish, scholarship, the, pronunciation, is, given, as, uzlug, a, v, p, 451, without, any,
