rhetoric, and, philosophy, in, nazianzus, caesarea, alexandria, and, athens, on, the, way, to, athens, his, ship, encountered, a, violent, storm, and, the, terrified, gregory, prayed, to, christ, that, if, he, would, deliver, him, he, would, dedicate, his, life, to, his, service, 28, while, at, athens, he, developed, a, close, friendship, with, his, fellow, student, basil, of, caesarea, and, also, made, the, acquaintance, of, flavius, claudius, julianus, who, would, later, become, the, emperor, known, as, julian, the, apostate, 19, 25, in, athens, gregory, studied, under, the, famous,

his, father, s, decision, to, force, him, to, choose, between, priestly, services, and, a, solitary, existence, calling, it, an, act, of, tyranny, 32, leaving, home, after, a, few, days, he, met, his, friend, basil, at, annesoi, where, the, two, lived, as, ascetics, 102, however, basil, urged, him, to, return, home, to, assist, his, father, which, he, did, for, the, next, year, arriving, at, nazianzus, gregory, found, the, local, christian, community, split, by, theological, differences, and, his, father, accused, of, heresy, by, local, monks, 107, gregory, helped, to, heal, the, division, through, a, combination, of, personal, diplomacy, and, oratory, by, this, time, emperor, julian, had, publicly, declared, himself, in, opposition, to, christianity, 115, in, response, to, the, emperor, s, rejection, of, the, christian, faith, gregory, composed, his, invectives, against, julian, between, 362, and, 363, invectives, asserts, that, christianity, will, overcome, imperfect, rulers, such, as, julian, through, love, and, patience, this, process, as, described, by, gregory, is, the, public, manifestation, of, the, process, of, deification, theosis, which, leads, to, a, spiritual, elevation, and, mystical, union, with, god, 121, julian, resolved, in, late, 362, to, vigorously, prosecute, gregory, and, his, other, christian, critics, however, the, emperor, perished, the, following, year, during, a, campaign, against, the, persians, 125, 6, with, the, death, of, the, emperor, gregory, and, the, eastern, churches, were, no, longer, under, the, threat, of, persecution, as, the, new, emperor, jovian, was, an, avowed, christian, and, supporter, of, the, church, 130, gregory, spent, the, next, few, years, combating, arianism, which, threatened, to, divide, the, region, of, cappadocia, in, this, tense, environment, gregory, interceded, on, behalf, of, his, friend, basil, with, bishop, eusebius, of, caesarea, mazaca, 138, 42, the, two, friends, then, entered, a, period, of, close, fraternal, cooperation, as, they, participated, in, a, great, rhetorical, contest, of, the, caesarean, church, precipitated, by, the, arrival, of, accomplished, arian, theologians, and, rhetors, 143, in, the, subsequent, public, debates, presided, over, by, agents, of, the, emperor, valens, gregory, and, basil, emerged, triumphant, this, success, confirmed, for, both, gregory, and, basil, that, their, futures, lay, in, administration, of, the, church, 143, basil, who, had, long, displayed, inclinations, to, the, episcopacy, was, elected, bishop, of, the, see, of, caesarea, in, cappadocia, in, 370, gregory, was, ordained, bishop, of, sasima, in, 372, by, basil, 190, 5, basil, created, this, see, in, order, to, strengthen, his, position, in, his, dispute, with, anthimus, bishop, of, tyana, the, ambitions, of, gregory, s, father, to, have, his, son, rise, in, the, church, hierarchy, and, the, insistence, of, his, friend, basil, convinced, gregory, to, accept, this, position, despite, his, reservations, gregory, would, later, refer, to, his, episcopal, ordination, as, forced, upon, him, by, his, strong, willed, father, and, basil, 187, 92, describing, his, new, bishopric, gregory, lamented, how, it, was, nothing, more, than, an, utterly, dreadful, pokey, little, hole, a, paltry, horse, stop, on, the, main, road, devoid, of, water, vegetation, or, the, company, of, gentlemen, this, was, my, church, of, sasima, he, made, little, effort, to, administer, his, new, diocese, complaining, to, basil, that, he, preferred, instead, to, pursue, a, contemplative, life, 38, 9, by, late, 372, gregory, returned, to, nazianzus, to, assist, his, dying, father, with, the, administration, of, his, diocese, 199, this, strained, his, relationship, with, basil, who, insisted, that, gregory, resume, his, post, at, sasima, gregory, retorted, that, he, had, no, intention, to, continue, to, play, the, role, of, pawn, to, advance, basil, s, interests, he, instead, focused, his, attention, on, his, new, duties, as, coadjutor, of, nazianzus, i, following, the, deaths, of, his, mother, and, father, in, 374, gregory, continued, to, administer, the, diocese, of, nazianzus, but, refused, to, be, named, bishop, donating, most, of, his, inheritance, to, the, needy, he, lived, an, austere, existence, at, the, end, of, 375, he, withdrew, to, a, monastery, at, seleukia, living, there, for, three, years, near, the, end, of, this, period, his, friend, basil, died, although, gregory, s, health, did, not, permit, him, to, attend, the, funeral, he, wrote, a, heartfelt, letter, of, condolence, to, basil, s, brother, gregory, of, nyssa, and, composed, twelve, memorial, poems, dedicated, to, the, memory, of, his, departed, friend, the, greek, anthology, book, i, epigram, 86, and, book, viii, epigrams, 2, 11, upon, the, death, of, emperor, valens, in, 378, the, accession, of, theodosius, i, a, steadfast, supporter, of, nicene, orthodoxy, was, good, news, to, those, who, wished, to, purge, constantinople, of, arian, and, apollinarian, domination, 235, the, exiled, nicene, party, gradually, returned, to, the, city, from, his, deathbed, basil, reminded, them, of, gregory, s, capabilities, and, likely, recommended, his, friend, to, champion, the, trinitarian, cause, in, constantinople, 235, 6, in, 379, the, antioch, synod, and, its, archbishop, meletios, asked, gregory, to, go, to, constantinople, to, lead, a, theological, campaign, to, win, over, that, city, to, nicene, orthodoxy, 42, after, much, hesitation, gregory, agreed, his, cousin, theodosia, offered, him, a, villa, for, his, residence, gregory, immediately, transformed, much, of, it, into, a, church, naming, it, anastasia, a, scene, for, the, resurrection, of, the, faith, 241, from, this, little, chapel, he, delivered, five, powerful, discourses, on, nicene, doctrine, explaining, the, nature, of, the, trinity, and, the, unity, of, the, godhead, refuting, the, eunomion, denial, of, the, holy, spirit, s, divinity, gregory, offered, this, argument, look, at, these, facts, christ, is, born, the, holy, spirit, is, his, forerunner, christ, is, baptized, the, spirit, bears, witness, to, this, christ, works, miracles, the, spirit, accompanies, them, christ, ascends, the, spirit, takes, his, place, what, great, things, are, there, in, the, idea, of, god, which, are, not, in, his, power, what, titles, appertaining, to, god, do, not, apply, also, to, him, except, for, unbegotten, and, begotten, i, tremble, when, i, think, of, such, an, abundance, of, titles, and, how, many, names, they, blaspheme, those, who, revolt, against, the, spirit, gregory, s, homilies, were, well, received, and, attracted, ever, growing, crowds, to, anastasia, fearing, his, popularity, his, opponents, decided, to, strike, on, the, vigil, of, easter, in, 379, an, arian, mob, burst, into, his, church, during, worship, services, wounding, gregory, and, killing, another, bishop, escaping, the, mob, gregory, next, found, himself, betrayed, by, his, erstwhile, friend, the, philosopher, maximus, the, cynic, maximus, who, was, in, secret, alliance, with, peter, bishop, of, alexandria, attempted, to, seize, gregory, s, position, and, have, himself, ordained, bishop, of, constantinople, 43, shocked, gregory, decided, to, resign, his, office, but, the, faction, faithful, to, him, induced, him, to, stay, and, ejected, maximus, this, episode, left, gregory, embarrassed, and, exposed, him, to, criticism, as, a, provincial, simpleton, unable, to, cope, with, the, intrigues, of, the, imperial, city, 43, affairs, in, constantinople, remained, confused, as, gregory, s, position, was, still, unofficial, and, arian, priests, yet, occupied, many, important, churches, the, arrival, of, the, emperor, theodosius, in, 380, settled, matters, in, gregory, s, favor, the, emperor, determined, to, eliminate, arianism, expelled, bishop, demophilus, gregory, was, subsequently, enthroned, as, bishop, of, constantinople, at, the, basilica, of, the, apostles, replacing, demophilus, 45, theodosius, wanted, to, further, unify, the, entire, empire, behind, the, orthodox, position, and, decided, to, convene, a, church, council, to, resolve, matters, of, faith, and, discipline, 45, gregory, was, of, similar, mind, in, wishing, to, unify, christianity, in, the, spring, of, 381, they, convened, the, second, ecumenical, council, in, constantinople, which, was, attended, by, 150, eastern, bishops, after, the, death, of, the, presiding, bishop, meletius, of, antioch, gregory, was, selected, to, lead, the, council, hoping, to, reconcile, the, west, with, the, east, he, offered, to, recognize, paulinus, as, patriarch, of, antioch, the, egyptian, and, macedonian, bishops, who, had, supported, maximus, s, ordination, arrived, late, for, the, council, once, there, they, refused, to, recognise, gregory, s, position, as, head, of, the, church, of, constantinople, arguing, that, his, transfer, from, the, see, of, sasima, was, canonically, illegitimate, 358, 9, gregory, was, physically, exhausted, and, worried, that, he, was, losing, the, confidence, of, the, bishops, and, the, emperor, 359, rather, than, press, his, case, and, risk, further, division, he, decided, to, resign, his, office, let, me, be, as, the, prophet, jonah, i, was, responsible, for, the, storm, but, i, would, sacrifice, myself, for, the, salvation, of, the, ship, seize, me, and, throw, me, i, was, not, happy, when, i, ascended, the, throne, and, gladly, would, i, descend, it, he, shocked, the, council, with, his, surprise, resignation, and, then, delivered, a, dramatic, speech, to, theodosius, asking, to, be, released, from, his, offices, the, emperor, moved, by, his, words, applauded, commended, his, labor, and, granted, his, resignation, the, council, asked, him, to, appear, once, more, for, a, farewell, ritual, and, celebratory, orations, gregory, used, this, occasion, to, deliver, a, final, address, or, 42, and, then, departed, 361, returning, to, his, homeland, of, cappadocia, gregory, once, again, resumed, his, position, as, bishop, of, nazianzus, he, spent, the, next, year, combating, the, local, apollinarian, heretics, and, struggling, with, periodic, illness, he, also, began, composing, de, vita, sua, his, autobiographical, poem, 50, by, the, end, of, 383, he, found, his, health, too, feeble, to, cope, with, episcopal, duties, gregory, established, eulalius, as, bishop, of, nazianzus, and, then, withdrew, into, the, solitude, of, arianzum, after, enjoying, six, peaceful, years, in, retirement, at, his, family, estate, he, died, on, 25, january, in, 390, gregory, faced, stark, choices, throughout, his, life, should, he, pursue, studies, as, a, rhetor, or, philosopher, would, a, monastic, life, be, more, appropriate, than, public, ministry, was, it, better, to, blaze, his, own, path, or, follow, the, course, mapped, for, him, by, his, father, and, basil, gregory, s, writings, illuminate, the, conflicts, which, both, tormented, and, motivated, him, biographers, suggest, that, it, was, this, dialectic, which, defined, him, forged, his, character, and, inspired, his, search, for, meaning, and, truth, 54, gregory, s, most, significant, theological, contributions, arose, from, his, defense, of, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, he, is, especially, noted, for, his, contributions, to, the, field, of, pneumatology, that, is, theology, concerning, the, nature, of, the, holy, spirit, in, this, regard, gregory, is, the, first, to, use, the, idea, of, procession, to, describe, the, relationship, between, the, spirit, and, the, godhead, the, holy, spirit, is, truly, spirit, coming, forth, from, the, father, indeed, but, not, after, the, manner, of, the, son, for, it, is, not, by, generation, but, by, procession, since, i, must, coin, a, word, for, the, sake, of, clearness, although, gregory, does, not, fully, develop, the, concept, the, idea, of, procession, would, shape, most, later, thought, about, the, holy, spirit, he, emphasized, that, jesus, did, not, cease, to, be, god, when, he, became, a, man, nor, did, he, lose, any, of, his, divine, attributes, when, he, took, on, human, nature, furthermore, gregory, asserted, that, christ, was, fully, human, including, a, full, human, soul, he, also, proclaimed, the, eternality, of, the, holy, spirit, saying, that, the, holy, spirit, s, actions, were, somewhat, hidden, in, the, old, testament, but, much, clearer, since, the, ascension, of, jesus, into, heaven, and, the, descent, of, the, holy, spirit, at, the, feast, of, pentecost, in, contrast, to, the, neo, arian, belief, that, the, son, is, anomoios, or, unlike, the, father, and, with, the, semi, arian, assertion, that, the, son, is, homoiousios, or, like, the, father, gregory, and, his, fellow, cappadocians, maintained, the, nicaean, doctrine, of, homoousia, or, consubstantiality, of, the, son, with, the, father, 9, 10, the, cappadocian, fathers, asserted, that, god, s, nature, is, unknowable, to, man, helped, to, develop, the, framework, of, hypostases, or, three, persons, united, in, a, single, godhead, illustrated, how, jesus, is, the, eikon, of, the, father, and, explained, the, concept, of, theosis, the, belief, that, all, christians, can, be, assimilated, with, god, in, imitation, of, the, incarnate, son, as, the, divine, model, 10, some, of, gregory, s, theological, writings, suggest, that, like, his, friend, gregory, of, nyssa, he, may, have, supported, some, form, of, the, doctrine, of, apocatastasis, the, belief, that, god, will, bring, all, of, creation, into, harmony, with, the, kingdom, of, heaven, this, led, philip, schaff, and, late, nineteenth, century, christian, universalists, such, as, j, w, hanson, to, describe, gregory, s, theology, as, universalist, this, view, of, gregory, is, also, held, by, some, modern, theologians, such, as, john, sachs, who, said, that, gregory, had, leanings, toward, apocatastasis, but, in, a, cautious, undogmatic, way, however, it, is, not, clear, or, universally, accepted, that, gregory, held, to, the, doctrine, of, apocatastasis, apart, from, the, several, theological, discourses, gregory, was, also, one, of, the, most, important, early, christian, men, of, letters, a, very, accomplished, orator, even, perhaps, one, of, the, greatest, of, his, time, 21, gregory, was, also, a, very, prolific, poet, who, wrote, theological, moral, and, biographical, poems, the, book, viii, of, the, greek, anthology, contains, exclusively, 254, epigrams, of, his, gregory, s, great, nephew, nichobulos, served, as, his, literary, executor, preserving, and, editing, many, of, his, writings, a, cousin, eulalios, published, several, of, gregory, s, more, noteworthy, works, in, 391, xi, by, 400, rufinius, began, translating, his, orations, into, latin, as, gregory, s, works, circulated, throughout, the, empire, they, influenced, theological, thought, his, orations, were, cited, as, authoritative, by, the, first, council, of, ephesus, in, 431, by, 451, he, was, designated, theologus, or, theologian, by, the, council, of, chalcedon, xi, a, title, held, by, no, others, save, john, the, apostle, and, symeon, the, new, theologian, 949, 1022, ad, he, is, widely, quoted, by, eastern, orthodox, theologians, and, highly, regarded, as, a, defender, of, the, christian, faith, his, contributions, to, trinitarian, theology, are, also, influential, and, often, cited, in, the, western, churches, paul, tillich, credits, gregory, of, nazianzus, for, having, created, the, definitive, formulae, for, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, additionally, the, liturgy, of, st, gregory, the, theologian, in, use, by, the, coptic, church, is, named, after, him, following, his, death, gregory, was, buried, at, nazianzus, his, relics, consisting, of, portions, of, his, body, and, clothing, were, transferred, to, constantinople, in, 950, into, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, part, of, the, relics, were, taken, from, constantinople, by, crusaders, during, the, fourth, crusade, in, 1204, and, ended, up, in, rome, on, 27, november, 2004, those, relics, along, with, those, of, john, chrysostom, were, returned, to, constantinople, now, istanbul, by, pope, john, paul, ii, with, the, vatican, retaining, a, small, portion, of, both, the, relics, are, now, enshrined, in, the, patriarchal, cathedral, of, st, george, in, the, fanar, during, the, six, years, of, life, which, remained, to, him, after, his, final, retirement, to, his, birthplace, gregory, composed, the, greater, part, of, his, copious, poetical, works, these, include, a, valuable, autobiographical, poem, of, nearly, 2, 000, lines, about, one, hundred, other, shorter, poems, relating, to, his, past, career, and, a, large, number, of, epitaphs, epigrams, and, epistles, to, well, known, people, during, that, era, the, poems, that, he, wrote, that, dealt, with, his, personal, affairs, refer, to, the, continuous, illness, and, severe, sufferings, physical, and, spiritual, which, assailed, him, during, his, last, years, in, the, tiny, plot, of, ground, at, arianzus, all, that, remained, to, him, of, his, rich, inheritance, was, by, a, fountain, near, which, there, was, a, shady, walk, gregory, retired, here, to, spend, his, days, as, a, hermit, it, was, during, this, time, that, he, decided, to, write, theological, discourses, and, poetry, of, both, a, religious, and, an, autobiographical, nature, he, would, receive, occasional, visits, from, intimate, friends, as, well, as, visits, from, strangers, who, were, attracted, to, his, retreat, by, his, large, reputation, for, sanctity, and, learning, he, died, about, 25, january, 390, although, the, exact, date, of, his, death, is, unknown, gregory, of, nazianzus, is, celebrated, on, different, days, across, christianity
