widespread, political, and, social, dissatisfaction, with, the, umayyad, caliphate, was, spearheaded, by, muhammad, s, extended, family, who, were, seen, by, muslims, as, god, inspired, leaders, in, their, religious, struggle, to, establish, justice, over, impiety, al, sadiq, s, imamate, extended, over, the, latter, half, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, which, was, marked, by, many, often, shia,

s, policy, of, quietism, in, this, period, and, in, particular, was, not, involved, in, the, uprising, of, his, uncle, zayd, who, enjoyed, the, support, of, the, mu, tazilites, and, the, traditionalists, of, medina, and, kufa, al, sadiq, also, played, no, role, in, the, abbasid, overthrow, of, the, umayyads, his, response, to, a, request, for, help, from, abu, muslim, the, khorasani, rebel, leader, was, to, burn, his, letter, saying, this, man, is, not, one, of, my, men, this, time, is, not, mine, at, the, same, time, al, sadiq, did, not, advance, his, claims, to, the, caliphate, even, though, he, saw, himself, as, the, divinely, designated, leader, of, the, islamic, community, umma, this, spiritual, rather, than, political, imamate, of, al, sadiq, was, accompanied, by, his, teaching, of, the, taqiya, doctrine, religious, dissimulation, to, protect, the, shia, against, prosecution, by, sunni, rulers, in, this, period, al, sadiq, taught, quietly, in, medina, and, developed, his, considerable, reputation, as, a, scholar, according, to, momen, the, years, of, transition, from, the, umayyads, to, the, abbasids, was, a, period, of, weak, central, authority, allowing, al, sadiq, to, teach, freely, some, four, thousand, scholars, are, thus, reported, to, have, studied, under, al, sadiq, among, these, were, abu, anifa, and, malik, ibn, anas, founders, of, the, hanafi, and, maliki, schools, of, law, in, sunni, islam, wasil, ibn, ata, founder, of, the, mu, tazila, school, of, thought, was, also, among, his, pupils, after, their, overthrow, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, the, abbasids, violently, prosecuted, their, former, shia, allies, against, the, umayyads, because, they, had, relied, on, the, public, sympathy, for, the, ahl, al, bayt, to, attain, power, the, abbasids, considered, al, sadiq, a, potential, threat, to, their, rule, as, the, leader, of, the, politically, quiet, branch, of, the, shia, he, was, summoned, by, al, mansur, to, baghdad, but, was, reportedly, able, to, convince, the, caliph, to, let, him, stay, in, medina, by, quoting, the, hadith, the, man, who, goes, away, to, make, a, living, will, achieve, his, purpose, but, he, who, sticks, to, his, family, will, prolong, his, life, al, sadiq, remained, passive, in, 762, ce, to, the, failed, uprising, of, his, nephew, muhammad, al, nafs, al, zakiyya, nevertheless, he, was, arrested, and, interrogated, by, al, mansur, and, held, in, samarra, near, baghdad, before, being, allowed, to, return, to, medina, his, house, was, burned, by, order, of, al, mansur, though, he, was, unharmed, and, there, are, reports, of, multiple, arrests, and, attempts, on, his, life, by, the, caliph, ja, far, al, sadiq, was, about, thirty, seven, when, his, father, al, b, qir, died, after, designating, him, as, the, next, sh, te, imam, he, held, the, imamate, for, at, least, twenty, eight, years, his, imamate, coincided, with, a, crucial, period, in, the, history, of, islam, as, he, witnessed, both, the, overthrow, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, by, the, abbasids, in, the, mid, 8th, century, 661, 750, ce, and, later, the, abbasids, prosecution, of, their, former, sh, te, allies, against, the, umayyads, the, leadership, of, the, early, sh, a, community, was, also, disputed, among, its, different, factions, in, this, period, the, various, alid, uprisings, against, the, umayyads, and, later, the, abbasids, gained, considerable, support, among, the, shia, among, the, leaders, of, these, movements, were, zayd, ibn, ali, al, sadiq, s, uncle, yahya, bin, zayd, al, sadiq, s, cousin, muhammad, al, nafs, al, zakiyya, and, his, brother, al, sadiq, s, nephews, these, claimants, saw, the, imamate, and, caliphate, as, inseparable, for, establishing, the, rule, of, justice, according, to, jafri, in, particular, zayd, argued, that, the, imamate, could, belong, to, any, descendant, of, hasan, or, husayn, who, is, learned, pious, and, revolts, against, the, tyrants, of, his, time, in, contrast, similar, to, his, father, and, his, grandfather, al, sadiq, adopted, a, quiescent, attitude, and, kept, aloof, from, politics, he, viewed, the, imamate, and, caliphate, as, separate, institutions, until, such, time, that, god, would, make, the, imam, victorious, this, imam, who, must, be, a, descendant, of, muhammad, through, ali, and, fatima, derives, his, exclusive, authority, not, from, political, claims, but, from, nass, divinely, inspired, designation, by, the, previous, imam, and, he, also, inherits, the, special, knowledge, ilm, which, qualifies, him, for, the, position, al, sadiq, did, not, originate, this, theory, of, imamate, which, was, already, adopted, by, his, predecessors, zayn, al, abidin, and, al, baqir, rather, al, sadiq, leveraged, the, sudden, climate, of, political, instability, to, freely, propagate, and, elaborate, the, shia, teachings, including, the, theory, of, imamate, after, the, death, of, ja, far, al, sadiq, his, following, fractured, and, the, largest, group, who, came, to, be, known, as, the, twelvers, followed, his, younger, son, musa, al, kadhim, it, also, appears, that, many, expected, the, next, imam, to, be, al, sadiq, s, eldest, son, isma, il, who, predeceased, his, father, this, group, which, later, formed, the, isma, ili, branch, either, believed, that, isma, il, was, still, alive, or, instead, accepted, the, imamate, of, isma, il, s, son, muhammad, while, the, twelvers, and, the, isma, ilis, are, the, only, extant, shia, sects, today, there, were, more, factions, at, the, time, some, followers, of, al, sadiq, accepted, the, imamate, of, his, eldest, surviving, son, abdullah, al, aftah, several, influential, followers, of, al, sadiq, are, recorded, to, have, first, followed, abdullah, and, then, changed, their, allegiance, to, musa, as, abdullah, later, died, childless, the, majority, of, his, followers, returned, to, musa, a, minority, of, al, sadiq, s, followers, joined, his, other, son, muhammad, al, dibaj, who, led, an, unsuccessful, uprising, against, caliph, al, ma, mun, after, which, he, abdicated, and, publicly, confessed, his, error, a, final, group, believed, that, al, sadiq, was, not, dead, and, would, return, as, mahdi, the, promised, savior, in, islam, al, sadiq, died, in, 765, ce, 148, ah, at, sixty, four, or, sixty, five, his, death, in, shia, sources, is, attributed, to, poisoning, at, the, instigation, of, al, mansur, according, to, tabatabai, after, being, detained, in, samarra, al, sadiq, was, allowed, to, return, to, medina, where, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, in, hiding, until, he, was, poisoned, by, order, of, al, mansur, he, was, buried, in, the, al, baqi, cemetery, being, one, of, the, 4, imams, to, be, buried, in, the, cemetery, the, other, imams, being, hasan, ibn, ali, ali, ibn, husayn, and, muhammad, ibn, ali, in, medina, and, his, tomb, was, a, place, of, pilgrimage, until, 1926, it, was, then, that, wahhabis, under, the, leadership, of, ibn, saud, the, founding, king, of, saudi, arabia, conquered, medina, for, the, second, time, and, razed, all, the, tombs, except, that, of, the, islamic, prophet, according, to, tabatabai, upon, hearing, the, news, of, his, death, al, mansur, ordered, the, governor, of, medina, to, behead, al, sadiq, s, heir, the, future, imam, the, governor, however, learned, that, al, sadiq, had, chosen, four, people, rather, than, one, to, administer, his, will, al, mansur, himself, the, governor, the, imam, s, oldest, surviving, son, abdullah, al, aftah, and, musa, al, kazim, his, younger, son, al, mansur, s, plot, was, thus, thwarted, al, sadiq, married, fatima, a, descendant, of, hasan, with, whom, he, had, two, sons, isma, il, the, sixth, isma, ili, imam, and, abdullah, al, aftah, he, also, married, hamida, khatun, a, slave, girl, from, berber, or, andalusia, who, bore, al, sadiq, three, more, sons, musa, al, kazim, the, seventh, twelver, imam, muhammad, al, dibaj, and, ishaq, al, mu, tamin, she, was, known, as, hamida, the, pure, and, respected, for, her, religious, learning, al, sadiq, often, referred, other, women, to, learn, the, tenets, of, islam, from, her, he, is, reported, to, have, praised, her, hamida, is, removed, from, every, impurity, like, an, ingot, of, pure, gold, ishaq, al, mu, tamin, is, said, to, have, married, sayyida, nafisa, a, descendant, of, hasan, after, ali, al, sadiq, is, possibly, the, most, famed, religious, scholar, of, the, house, of, muhammad, widely, recognized, as, an, authority, in, islamic, law, theology, hadith, and, esoteric, and, occult, sciences, amir, moezzi, considers, him, possibly, the, most, brilliant, scholar, of, his, time, and, the, variety, of, at, times, contradictory, views, ascribed, to, al, sadiq, suggest, that, he, was, an, influential, figure, in, the, history, of, early, islamic, thought, as, nearly, all, the, early, intellectual, factions, of, islam, except, perhaps, the, kharijites, wished, to, incorporate, al, sadiq, into, their, history, in, order, to, bolster, their, schools, positions, he, is, cited, in, a, wide, range, of, historical, sources, including, the, works, of, al, tabari, ya, qubi, al, masudi, and, ibn, khallikan, this, popularity, however, has, hampered, the, scholarly, attempts, to, ascertain, al, sadiq, s, actual, views, a, number, of, religious, and, scientific, works, also, bear, al, sadiq, s, name, though, scholars, generally, regard, them, as, inauthentic, it, seems, likely, that, he, was, a, teacher, who, left, writing, to, others, the, most, extensive, contributions, of, al, sadiq, were, to, the, twelver, shia, helping, establish, them, as, a, serious, intellectual, force, in, the, late, umayyad, and, early, abbasid, periods, according, to, gleave, tabatabai, writes, that, the, number, of, traditions, left, behind, by, al, sadiq, and, his, father, al, baqir, were, more, than, all, the, hadiths, recorded, from, muhammad, and, the, other, shia, imams, combined, shia, thought, has, continued, to, develop, based, on, the, teachings, of, the, shia, imams, including, al, sadiq, according, to, rizvi, al, sadiq, preached, against, slavery, following, his, predecessors, zayn, al, abidin, and, al, baqir, al, sadiq, further, elaborated, the, shia, doctrine, of, imamate, which, has, become, the, hallmark, of, the, twelver, and, isma, ili, shia, theologies, but, rejected, by, the, zaydis, in, this, doctrine, imam, is, a, descendant, of, muhammad, through, ali, and, fatima, who, derives, his, exclusive, authority, not, from, political, claims, but, from, nass, that, is, divinely, inspired, designation, by, the, previous, imam, as, the, successor, of, muhammad, the, imam, has, an, all, inclusive, mandate, for, temporal, and, religious, leadership, of, the, islamic, community, though, this, doctrine, views, the, imamate, and, caliphate, as, separate, institutions, until, such, time, that, god, would, make, the, imam, victorious, the, imam, also, inherits, from, his, predecessor, the, special, knowledge, ilm, which, qualifies, him, for, the, position, similar, to, muhammad, imam, is, believed, to, be, infallible, thanks, to, this, unique, knowledge, which, also, establishes, him, as, the, sole, authorized, source, for, interpreting, the, revelation, and, guiding, the, muslims, along, the, right, path, this, line, of, imams, in, shia, islam, is, traced, back, to, ali, who, succeeded, muhammad, through, a, divine, decree, law, in, islam, is, an, all, embracing, body, of, ordinances, that, govern, worship, and, ritual, in, addition, to, a, proper, legal, system, building, on, the, work, of, his, father, al, sadiq, is, remembered, as, the, eponymous, founder, of, the, ja, fari, school, of, law, al, madhab, al, ja, fari, followed, by, the, twelver, shia, according, to, lalani, the, isma, ili, jurisprudence, fiqh, as, codified, by, al, qadi, al, numan, is, also, primarily, based, on, the, large, corpus, of, statements, left, behind, by, al, sadiq, and, his, father, al, baqir, al, sadiq, denounced, the, contemporary, use, of, opinion, ray, personal, juristic, reasoning, ejtehad, and, analogical, reasoning, qias, as, human, attempts, to, impose, regularity, and, predictability, onto, the, laws, of, god, he, argued, that, god, s, law, is, occasional, and, unpredictable, and, that, muslims, should, submit, to, the, inscrutable, will, of, god, as, revealed, by, the, imam, he, also, embraced, a, devolved, system, of, legal, authority, it, is, ascribed, to, al, sadiq, that, it, is, for, us, to, set, out, foundational, rules, and, principles, usul, and, it, is, for, you, to, derive, the, specific, legal, rulings, for, actual, cases, similarly, when, asked, how, legal, disputes, within, the, community, should, be, solved, al, sadiq, described, the, state, apparatus, as, evil, tagut, and, encouraged, the, shia, to, refer, to, those, who, relate, our, hadiths, because, the, imams, have, made, such, a, one, a, judge, hakam, over, you, the, sunni, jurisprudence, is, based, on, the, three, pillars, of, the, quran, the, practices, of, muhammad, sunna, and, consensus, ijma, whereas, the, twelver, shia, jurisprudence, adds, to, these, pillars, a, fourth, pillar, of, reasoning, aql, during, the, occultation, of, mahdi, in, shia, islam, sunna, also, includes, the, practices, of, the, shia, imams, taqiya, is, a, form, of, religious, dissimulation, where, an, individual, can, hide, one, s, beliefs, under, persecution, taqiya, was, introduced, by, al, baqir, and, later, advocated, by, al, sadiq, to, protect, his, followers, from, prosecution, at, the, time, when, al, mansur, the, abbasid, caliph, conducted, a, brutal, campaign, against, the, alids, and, their, supporters, this, doctrine, is, based, on, verse, 16, 106, of, the, quran, where, the, wrath, of, god, is, said, to, await, the, apostate, except, those, who, are, compelled, while, their, hearts, are, firm, in, faith, according, to, amir, moezzi, in, the, early, sources, taqiya, means, the, keeping, or, safeguarding, of, the, secrets, of, the, imams, teaching, which, may, have, resulted, at, times, in, contradictory, traditions, from, the, imams, in, such, cases, if, one, of, the, contradictory, reports, matches, the, corresponding, sunni, doctrine, it, would, be, discarded, because, the, imam, must, have, had, agreed, with, sunnis, to, avoid, prosecution, of, himself, or, his, community, armstrong, suggests, that, taqiya, also, kept, conflict, to, a, minimum, with, those, religious, scholars, ulama, who, disagreed, with, the, shia, teachings, on, the, question, of, predestination, and, free, will, which, was, under, much, discussion, at, the, time, al, sadiq, followed, his, father, portraying, human, responsibility, but, preserving, god, s, autocracy, asserting, that, god, decreed, some, things, absolutely, but, left, others, to, human, agency, this, compromise, widely, adopted, afterward, is, highlighted, when, al, sadiq, was, asked, if, god, forces, his, servants, to, do, evil, or, whether, he, had, delegated, power, to, them, he, answered, negatively, to, both, questions, and, instead, suggested, the, blessings, of, your, lord, are, between, these, two, al, sadiq, taught, that, god, the, most, high, decreed, some, things, for, us, and, he, has, likewise, decreed, some, things, through, our, agency, what, he, has, decreed, for, us, or, on, our, behalf, he, has, concealed, from, us, but, what, he, has, decreed, through, our, agency, he, has, revealed, to, us, we, are, not, concerned, therefore, so, much, with, what, he, has, decreed, for, us, as, we, are, with, what, he, has, decreed, through, our, agency, al, sadiq, is, also, credited, with, the, statement, that, god, does, not, order, created, beings, to, do, something, without, providing, for, them, a, means, of, not, doing, it, though, they, do, not, do, it, or, not, do, it, without, god, s, permission, al, sadiq, declared, whoever, claims, that, god, has, ordered, evil, has, lied, about, god, whoever, claims, that, both, good, and, evil, are, attributed, to, him, has, lied, about, god, in, his, prayers, he, often, said, there, is, no, work, of, merit, on, my, own, behalf, or, on, behalf, of, another, and, in, evil, there, is, no, excuse, for, me, or, for, another, al, sadiq, is, attributed, with, what, is, regarded, as, the, most, important, principle, for, judging, traditions, that, a, hadith, should, be, rejected, if, it, contradicts, the, quran, whatever, other, evidence, might, support, it, in, his, books, haqaeq, al, tafsir, and, ziadat, aqaeq, al, tafsir, the, author, abd, al, ra, man, solami, cites, al, adiq, as, one, of, his, major, if, not, the, major, sources, it, is, said, that, al, sadiq, merged, the, inner, and, the, outer, meanings, of, the, quran, to, reach, a, new, interpretation, of, it, ta, wil, it, is, ascribed, to, al, sadiq, that, the, book, of, god, comprises, four, things, the, statement, set, down, ibarah, the, implied, purport, isharah, the, hidden, meanings, relating, to, the, supra, sensible, world, lata, ij, and, the, exalted, spiritual, doctrines, haqaiq, the, literal, statement, is, for, the, ordinary, believers, awamm, the, implied, purport, is, the, concern, of, the, elite, khawass, the, hidden, meanings, pertain, to, the, friends, of, god, awliya, the, exalted, spiritual, doctrines, are, the, province, of, the, prophets, anbiya, these, remarks, echo, the, statement, of, ali, the, first, shia, imam, ja, far, al, sadiq, s, significance, in, the, formation, of, early, muslim, thought, is, demonstrated, by, the, fact, that, his, name, is, used, as, a, reference, in, sufi, scientific, sunni, legal, ismaili, and, ghul, t, circles, most, of, these, groups, desired, to, use, his, legacy, for, their, own, agendas, however, the, imami, shia, tradition, is, the, most, comprehensive, source, for, his, teachings, while, the, sunnis, respect, al, sadiq, as, a, transmitter, of, hadith, and, a, jurist, faq, h, shiites, view, him, as, an, imam, and, therefore, infallible, and, record, his, sayings, and, actions, in, the, works, of, hadith, and, jurisprudence, fiqh, in, the, shia, writings, of, the, imamiyya, his, legal, rulings, constitute, the, most, important, source, of, imamiyya, law, in, fact, the, imam, s, legal, doctrine, is, called, ja, fari, jurisprudence, madhhab, ja, fari, by, both, the, imamis, and, the, sunnis, in, order, to, refer, to, his, legal, authority, the, shias, considered, al, sadiq, the, only, legitimate, person, who, could, represent, the, sharia, in, his, time, and, have, the, authority, to, rule, according, to, imami, shi, as, ja, far, al, sadiq, is, the, sixth, imam, who, was, responsible, for, turning, the, imamiya, into, a, powerful, intellectual, movement, during, the, late, umayyad, and, early, abbasid, eras, al, sadiq, is, presented, by, ya, qubi, as, one, of, the, most, respected, personalities, of, his, epoch, adding, that, it, was, customary, to, refer, to, al, sadiq, as, the, learned, one, al, sadiq, is, respected, in, sunni, islam, as, a, jurist, and, a, master, teacher, of, hadith, sciences, who, is, cited, in, several, isnad, s, chains, of, transmissions, among, his, students, were, abu, anifa, and, malik, ibn, anas, founders, of, the, hanafi, and, maliki, schools, of, law, in, sunni, islam, according, to, jafri, the, famous, sunni, jurist, malik, ibn, anas, would, quote, al, sadiq, as, the, truthful, thiqa, ja, far, ibn, muhammad, himself, told, me, that, a, similar, attitude, is, reported, from, abu, hanifa, malik, was, a, teacher, of, al, shafi, i, who, was, in, turn, a, teacher, of, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, it, has, thus, been, noted, that, all, of, the, four, imams, of, sunni, fiqh, are, connected, to, ja, far, whether, directly, or, indirectly, wasil, ibn, ata, founder, of, the, mu, tazila, school, of, thought, was, also, among, al, sadiq, s, pupils, the, sunni, scholar, al, dhahabi, recognizes, al, sadiq, s, contribution, to, sunni, tradition, and, al, shahrastani, the, influential, sunni, historian, pays, al, sadiq, a, high, tribute, in, his, work, there, are, also, many, sunni, traditions, in, which, al, sadiq, and, other, descendants, of, ali, ibn, abi, talib, deny, any, shia, affiliation, though, these, traditions, are, likely, due, to, later, sunni, propaganda, al, sadiq, holds, a, special, prominence, among, sufi, orders, a, number, of, early, sufi, figures, are, associated, with, al, sadiq, he, is, praised, in, the, sufi, literature, for, his, knowledge, of, ariqat, lit, path, and, numerous, sayings, and, writings, about, spiritual, progress, are, ascribed, to, him, in, sufi, circles, he, is, also, viewed, at, the, head, of, the, sufi, line, of, saints, and, mystics, by, the, sufi, writers, abu, nu, aym, and, farid, al, din, attar, attar, praises, al, sadiq, as, the, one, who, spoke, more, than, the, other, imams, concerning, the, ariqat, who, excelled, in, writing, on, innermost, mysteries, and, truths, and, who, was, matchless, in, expounding, the, subtleties, and, secrets, of, revelation, however, some, of, the, material, attributed, to, al, sadiq, in, the, sufi, literature, is, said, to, be, apocryphal, among, others, the, shia, moqaddas, ardabili, has, thus, dismissed, the, alleged, links, between, al, sadiq, and, sufism, as, an, attempt, to, gain, the, authority, of, al, sadiq, for, sufi, teachings, gleave, and, bowering, suggest, that, tafsir, al, quran, manafe, sowar, al, quran, and, kawass, al, qoran, al, azam, three, mystical, commentaries, of, the, quran, attributed, to, al, sadiq, were, composed, after, his, death, because, these, works, demonstrate, a, mastery, of, the, recent, lexicon, of, muslim, mysticism, alternatively, taylor, is, certain, that, the, traditions, in, the, quranic, exegesis, edited, by, the, mystic, dhu, al, nun, misri, can, be, traced, back, to, the, imam, given, the, appeal, and, influence, of, al, sadiq, outside, the, circle, of, his, shia, supporters, algar, suggests, that, he, likely, played, some, role, in, the, formation, of, sufism, both, abu, nu, aym, and, attar, narrate, several, encounters, between, al, sadiq, and, contemporary, proto, sufis, to, highlight, his, asceticism, zuhd, one, encounter, describes, how, sofyan, awri, the, renowned, jurist, and, ascetic, allowed, himself, to, reproach, the, imam, for, his, silken, robe, only, for, the, imam, to, reveal, beneath, it, a, modest, white, woolen, cloak, explaining, that, the, finery, was, for, men, to, behold, and, the, woolen, cloak, for, god, the, imam, thus, displayed, the, former, and, concealed, the, latter, one, of, the, distinctive, features, of, the, ghul, t, is, the, imam, s, deification, one, group, of, them, called, the, mufawidda, preached, that, god, gave, muhammad, and, the, imams, the, authority, to, create, and, take, care, of, all, living, things, many, twelver, shi, i, traditions, state, that, al, baqir, and, al, sadiq, did, not, have, supernatural, abilities, and, did, not, perform, the, miracles, attributed, to, them, despite, these, denials, a, number, of, hadiths, that, contained, ghul, t, concepts, found, their, way, into, twelver, shiite, hadith, collections, according, to, some, early, imami, heresiographers, abu, al, khattab, died, 755, asserted, that, he, had, been, chosen, to, serve, as, al, sadiq, s, envoy, and, had, been, given, access, to, his, hidden, doctrines, it, seems, that, abu, al, khattab, s, views, on, al, sadiq, s, divinity, and, his, own, status, as, a, prophetic, messenger, of, god, eventually, led, al, sadiq, to, repudiate, him, in, 748, his, adherents, were, referred, to, as, khattabiyya, later, twelver, tradition, disavows, any, connection, between, al, sadiq, and, the, views, of, abu, al, khattab, the, same, imami, heresiographers, also, claim, that, al, mufaddal, ibn, umar, al, ju, fi, died, before, 799, and, his, followers, the, mufaddaliya, likewise, regarded, al, sadiq, as, a, god, and, themselves, as, his, prophets, however, it, is, not, certain, whether, the, mufaddaliya, ever, existed, and, in, twelver, hadith, al, mufaddal, consistently, appears, as, the, intimate, companion, of, ja, far, al, sadiq, and, his, son, musa, al, kazim, with, the, exception, of, the, brief, period, of, disgrace, with, ja, far, al, sadiq, due, to, his, khattabiyya, leanings, according, to, twelver, traditions, al, mufaddal, was, even, appointed, by, al, sadiq, to, control, the, excesses, of, khattabiyya, nevertheless, al, mufaddal, s, status, as, a, close, confidant, of, ja, far, al, sadiq, led, to, a, large, number, of, writings, being, attributed, to, him, by, later, authors, including, major, ghul, t, works, such, as, the, kitab, al, haft, wa, l, azilla, book, of, the, seven, and, the, shadows, and, the, kitab, al, sirat, book, of, the, path, in, yarsanism, is, ja, far, al, sadiq, considered, to, be, incarnation, of, an, angel, from, the, group, haft, sardar, the, seven, commanders, in, the, yaresan, book, doureh, ye, bahlul, is, written, that, yaresan, saint, bahlul, mahi, visited, ja, far, al, sadiq, in, baghdad, and, studied, there, a, large, number, of, religious, books, bear, al, sadiq, s, name, as, their, author, but, none, of, them, can, be, attributed, to, al, sadiq, with, certainty, it, has, been, suggested, that, al, sadiq, was, a, writer, who, left, the, work, of, writing, to, his, students, in, this, regard, some, of, the, works, attributed, to, jabir, ibn, hayyan, c, 850, c, 950, also, claim, to, be, mere, expositions, al, sadiq, s, teachings, a, quran, commentary, tafsir, a, book, on, divination, ketb, al, jafr, numerous, drafts, of, his, will, and, several, collections, of, legal, dicta, are, among, the, works, attributed, to, al, sadiq, most, of, the, extant, writings, attributed, to, al, sadiq, are, commentaries, tafsir, on, the, quran, in, sufi, circles, a, number, of, mystical, quranic, exegeses, are, attributed, to, al, sadiq, such, as, tafsir, al, quran, manafe, sowar, al, quran, and, kawass, al, quran, al, azam, another, attributed, work, is, the, book, of, jafr, a, mystical, commentary, which, according, to, ibn, khaldun, was, written, by, al, sadiq, about, the, hidden, batin, meanings, of, the, quran, according, to, ibn, khaldun, this, book, was, transmitted, from, al, sadiq, and, written, down, by, h, r, n, ibn, sa, d, al, ijl, perhaps, the, most, influential, mystical, exegesis, attributed, to, al, sadiq, is, the, aq, iq, al, tafs, r, composed, by, ab, abd, al, ra, m, n, al, sulam, d, 330, 942, this, text, was, first, introduced, to, modern, scholarship, by, louis, massignon, and, was, later, published, in, a, critical, edition, by, paul, nwyia, another, version, was, published, by, al, zay, r, one, of, the, outstanding, features, of, this, exegesis, is, its, emphasis, on, letter, mysticism, it, is, considered, to, be, the, oldest, mystical, commentary, of, the, quran, after, sahl, al, tustari, s, exegesis, tafs, r, al, nu, m, n, is, another, exegesis, attributed, to, al, sadiq, which, he, supposedly, narrated, on, the, authority, of, ali, from, muhammad, this, treatise, was, compiled, by, muhammad, ibn, ibrahim, al, nu, mani, known, as, ibn, abi, zainab, the, 17th, century, scholar, mohammad, baqer, majlesi, recorded, it, in, his, bihar, al, anwar, a, summary, of, it, has, also, been, attributed, to, the, twelver, theologian, sharif, al, murtaza, and, was, published, under, the, title, ris, lat, al, mu, kam, wa, l, mutash, bih, tafs, r, al, im, m, al, diq, is, another, commentary, attributed, to, al, sadiq, which, agha, bozorg, tehrani, mentions, it, in, his, book, al, dhar, a, under, the, title, tafsir, al, imam, ja, far, bin, muhammad, al, sadiq, and, it, is, believed, that, one, of, sadiq, s, students, narrated, it, from, him, fuat, sezgin, calls, this, work, tafs, r, al, qur, n, a, copy, of, it, with, the, title, tafs, r, al, im, m, al, diq, according, to, bankipur, oriental, library, s, catalogue, is, written, by, al, nu, m, n, based, on, the, sayings, of, al, sadiq, this, commentary, is, arranged, according, to, the, surahs, of, the, quran, and, covers, only, the, words, of, the, quran, that, require, explanation, this, commentary, which, is, a, type, of, mystical, commentary, deals, with, both, the, exoteric, hir, and, the, esoteric, b, in, aspects, of, the, quran, it, is, mostly, about, god, and, his, relationship, with, mankind, also, man, s, knowledge, of, god, and, the, relationship, between, muhammad, and, god, the, taw, d, al, mufa, al, declaration, by, al, mufaddal, of, the, oneness, of, god, also, known, as, the, kit, b, f, bad, al, khalq, wa, l, athth, al, al, i, tib, r, book, on, the, beginning, of, creation, and, the, incitement, to, contemplation, is, a, ninth, century, treatise, concerned, with, proving, the, existence, of, god, attributed, to, ja, far, al, sadiq, s, financial, agent, al, mufaddal, ibn, umar, al, ju, fi, died, before, 799, the, work, presents, itself, as, a, dialogue, between, al, mufaddal, and, ja, far, al, sadiq, who, is, the, main, speaker, like, most, other, works, attributed, to, al, mufaddal, the, taw, d, al, mufa, al, was, in, fact, written, by, a, later, anonymous, author, who, took, advantage, of, al, mufaddal, s, status, as, one, of, the, closest, confidants, of, ja, far, al, sadiq, in, order, to, ascribe, their, own, ideas, to, the, illustrious, imam, however, it, differs, from, other, treatises, attributed, to, al, mufaddal, by, the, absence, of, any, content, that, is, specifically, shi, i, in, nature, a, trait, it, shares, with, only, one, other, mufaddal, work, also, dealing, with, a, rational, proof, for, the, existence, of, god, the, kit, b, al, ihl, laja, book, of, the, myrobalan, fruit, though, both, preserved, by, the, 17th, century, shi, i, scholar, muhammad, baqir, al, majlisi, died, 1699, the, only, thing, that, connects, the, taw, d, al, mufa, al, and, the, kit, b, al, ihl, laja, to, shi, ism, more, generally, is, their, ascription, to, ja, far, al, sadiq, and, al, mufaddal, rather, than, by, shi, i, doctrine, their, content, appears, to, be, influenced, by, mu, tazilism, a, rationalistic, school, of, islamic, speculative, theology, kal, m, the, taw, d, al, mufa, al, is, in, fact, a, revised, version, of, a, work, falsely, attributed, to, the, famous, mu, tazili, litterateur, al, jahiz, died, 868, under, the, title, kit, b, al, dal, il, wa, l, i, tib, r, al, al, khalq, wa, l, tadb, r, book, of, proofs, and, contemplation, on, creation, and, administration, both, the, taw, d, al, mufa, al, and, pseudo, jahiz, s, kit, b, al, dal, il, likely, go, back, on, an, earlier, 9th, century, text, which, has, sometimes, been, identified, as, the, kit, b, al, fikr, wa, l, i, tib, r, book, of, thought, and, contemplation, written, by, the, 9th, century, nestorian, christian, jibril, ibn, nuh, ibn, abi, nuh, al, nasrani, al, anbari, the, teleological, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, used, in, the, taw, d, al, mufa, al, is, inspired, by, syriac, christian, literature, especially, commentaries, on, the, hexameron, and, ultimately, goes, back, on, hellenistic, models, such, as, the, pseudo, aristotelian, de, mundo, on, the, universe, 3rd, 2nd, century, bce, and, stoic, theology, as, recorded, in, cicero, s, 106, 43, bce, de, natura, deorum, misbah, al, sharia, and, miftah, al, haqiqah, is, another, work, attributed, to, al, sadiq, it, is, on, personal, conduct, with, chapters, on, various, topics, such, as, legal, interests, interspersed, with, general, moral, issues, and, advice, on, how, to, lead, a, spiritual, life, and, thus, purify, the, soul, as, the, first, person, who, came, across, this, book, in, the, 7th, century, a, h, sayyed, ibn, tawus, described, it, as, a, collection, of, hadiths, of, jafar, al, sadiq, it, includes, a, prediction, of, future, events, and, sufferings, there, is, a, specific, shia, chapter, in, knowledge, of, the, imams, in, which, the, names, of, all, the, imams, both, before, al, sadiq, and, after, him, are, mentioned, during, the, exchange, of, reports, between, muhammad, and, salman, the, persian, mohammad, baqer, majlesi, considered, this, work, to, have, been, written, by, shaqiq, al, balkhi, who, supposedly, quoted, it, from, one, of, the, people, of, knowledge, and, not, explicitly, from, ja, far, al, sadiq, despite, majlesi, s, doubts, about, its, authenticity, this, work, remains, very, popular, as, a, manual, of, personal, worship, and, has, been, the, subject, of, a, number, of, commentaries, by, prominent, shia, and, sufi, scholars, it, has, also, been, translated, into, different, languages, its, manuscript, is, available, in, the, library, of, gotha, there, is, also, a, book, on, dream, interpretation, that, is, attributed, to, al, sadiq, and, is, known, by, the, name, taqsim, al, ro, y, it, is, identical, to, the, work, ket, b, al, taqsim, fi, ta, bir, al, olm, which, is, credited, to, ja, far, al, sadiq, eighty, various, types, of, dream, sightings, ranging, from, the, religious, dreams, of, god, angels, prophets, and, imams, to, the, profane, dreams, of, meat, fat, and, cheese, are, interpreted, by, ja, far, al, sadiq, in, this, book, according, to, robert, gleave, it, is, not, always, clear, whether, they, can, be, regarded, as, works, attributed, to, jafar, al, sadiq, or, works, attributed, to, ali, ibn, abi, talib, that, is, transmitted, through, ja, far, al, sadiq, from, a, shia, perspective, this, is, not, problematic, because, there, is, no, discernible, difference, between, the, knowledge, of, one, imam, and, that, of, another, from, a, religious, perspective, the, kit, b, al, ihl, laja, is, presented, as, al, sadiq, s, opinions, transmitted, through, al, mufaddal, the, work, is, allegedly, a, response, to, al, mufaddal, s, request, for, a, refutation, of, atheists, jafar, al, sadiq, describes, his, own, argument, with, an, atheist, indian, doctor, in, it, the, discussion, took, place, as, the, doctor, prepared, a, myrobalan, plant, based, medication, known, in, arabic, as, ihl, laj, and, hence, the, title, of, the, work, momen, contends, that, of, the, few, thousand, students, who, are, said, to, have, studied, under, al, sadiq, only, a, few, could, have, been, shia, considering, that, al, sadiq, did, not, openly, advance, his, claims, to, the, imamate, notable, shia, students, of, al, sadiq, included
