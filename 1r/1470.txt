during, the, spanish, civil, war, which, pitted, a, government, of, democrats, anarchists, socialists, and, communists, supported, by, the, soviet, union, and, international, volunteers, against, a, rebellion, of, conservatives, monarchists, nationalists, and, fascists, supported, by, both, hitler, and, mussolini, with, the, rebels, ultimately, winning, franco, s, authoritarian, government, remained, dominant, in, spain, until, the, 1960s, with, franco, s, increasing, age, left, wing, protests, increased, while, at, the, same, time, the, far, right, factions, demanded, the, return, of, a, hardline, absolute, monarchy, at, the, time, the, heir, to, the, throne, of, spain, was, infante, juan, count, of, barcelona, the, son, of, king, alfonso, xiii, however, franco, viewed, him, with, extreme, suspicion, believing, him, to, be, a, liberal, who, was, opposed, to, his, regime, juan, carlos, s, first, cousin, alfonso, duke, of, anjou, and, c, diz, was, also, briefly, considered, as, a, candidate, alfonso, was, known, to, be, an, ardent, francoist, and, married, franco, s, granddaughter, do, a, mar, a, del, carmen, mart, nez, bordi, y, franco, in, 1972, ultimately, franco, decided, to, skip, a, generation, and, name, infante, juan, carlos, as, his, personal, successor, franco, hoped, the, young, prince, could, be, groomed, to, take, over, the, nation, while, still, maintaining, the, ultraconservative, and, authoritarian, nature, of, his, regime, in, 1969, juan, carlos, was, officially, designated, heir, apparent, and, was, given, the, new, title, of, prince, of, spain, not, the, traditional, prince, of, asturias, as, a, condition, of, being, named, heir, apparent, he, was, required, to, swear, loyalty, to, franco, s, movimiento, nacional, which, he, did,

often, took, part, in, official, and, ceremonial, state, functions, standing, alongside, the, dictator, much, to, the, anger, of, hardline, republicans, and, more, moderate, liberals, who, hoped, that, franco, s, death, would, bring, in, an, era, of, reform, during, 1969, 1975, juan, carlos, publicly, supported, franco, s, regime, although, franco, s, health, worsened, during, those, years, whenever, he, did, appear, in, public, from, state, dinners, to, military, parades, it, was, in, juan, carlos, s, company, however, as, the, years, progressed, juan, carlos, began, meeting, secretly, with, political, opposition, leaders, and, exiles, who, were, fighting, to, bring, liberal, reform, to, the, country, he, also, had, secret, conversations, with, his, father, over, the, telephone, franco, for, his, part, remained, largely, oblivious, to, the, prince, s, actions, and, denied, allegations, from, his, ministers, and, advisors, that, juan, carlos, was, in, any, way, disloyal, to, his, vision, of, the, regime, during, periods, of, franco, s, temporary, incapacity, in, 1974, and, 1975, juan, carlos, was, acting, head, of, state, on, 30, october, 1975, franco, gave, full, control, to, juan, carlos, according, to, declassified, cia, reports, during, this, time, juan, carlos, secretly, acquiesced, and, arranged, with, king, hassan, ii, of, morocco, the, terms, of, the, so, called, green, march, the, partial, invasion, of, the, spanish, sahara, by, moroccan, civilians, followed, by, the, madrid, accords, handing, over, the, control, of, the, territory, to, morocco,

juan, carlos, spoke, of, three, factors, historical, tradition, national, laws, and, the, will, of, the, people, and, in, so, doing, referred, to, a, process, dating, back, to, the, civil, war, of, 1936, 39, he, swore, using, the, following, formula, i, swear, to, god, and, the, gospels, to, comply, and, enforce, compliance, to, the, fundamental, laws, of, the, realm, and, to, remain, loyal, to,

chilean, dictator, augusto, pinochet, who, had, traveled, to, spain, for, franco, s, funeral, not, to, attend, his, inauguration, juan, carlos, s, accession, met, with, relatively, little, parliamentary, opposition, some, members, of, the, movimiento, nacional, voted, against, recognizing, him, and, even, more, voted, against, the, 1976, law, for, political, reform, but, a, majority, of, movimiento, members, supported, both, measures, juan, carlos, quickly, instituted, reforms, to, the, great, displeasure, of, falangist, and, conservative, monarchist, elements, especially, in, the, military, who, had, expected, him, to, maintain, the, authoritarian, state, in, july, 1976, juan, carlos, dismissed, prime, minister, carlos, arias, navarro, who, had, been, attempting, to, continue, francoist, policies, in, the, face, of, the, king, s, attempts, at, democratization, he, instead, appointed, adolfo, su, rez, a, former, leader, of, the, movimiento, nacional, as, prime, minister, further, legitimacy, was, restored, to, juan, carlos, s, position, on, 14, may, 1977, when, his, father, whom, many, monarchists, had, recognized, as, the, legitimate, exiled, king, of, spain, during, the, franco, era, formally, renounced, his, claim, to, the, throne, and, recognized, his, son, as, the, sole, head, of, the, spanish, royal, house, transferring, to, him, the, historical, heritage, of, the, spanish, monarchy, thus, making, juan, carlos, both, de, facto, and, de, jure, king, in, the, eyes, of, the, traditional, monarchists, on, 20, may, 1977, the, leader, of, the, only, recently, legalized, spanish, socialist, workers, party, psoe, felipe, gonz, lez, accompanied, by, javier, solana, visited, juan, carlos, in, the, zarzuela, palace, the, event, represented, a, key, endorsement, of, the, monarchy, from, spain, s, political, left, who, had, been, historically, republican, left, wing, support, for, the, monarchy, had, grown, when, the, communist, party, of, spain, was, legalized, on, 9, april, 1977, a, move, juan, carlos, had, pressed, for, despite, enormous, right, wing, military, opposition, at, that, time, during, the, cold, war, on, 15, june, 1977, spain, held, its, first, post, franco, democratic, elections, juan, carlos, had, played, a, role, as, middleman, in, order, to, channel, 10, million, from, the, shah, of, iran, to, adolfo, su, rez, s, election, campaign, reportedly, asking, the, shah, for, the, money, to, save, spain, from, marxism, su, rez, went, on, to, win, the, election, and, become, the, first, democratically, elected, leader, of, the, new, regime, in, 1978, the, government, promulgated, a, new, constitution, that, acknowledged, juan, carlos, as, rightful, heir, of, the, spanish, dynasty, and, king, specifically, title, ii, section, 57, asserted, juan, carlos, s, right, to, the, throne, of, spain, by, dynastic, succession, in, the, bourbon, tradition, as, the, legitimate, heir, of, the, historic, dynasty, rather, than, as, the, designated, successor, of, franco, the, constitution, was, passed, by, the, democratically, elected, constituent, cortes, ratified, by, the, people, in, a, referendum, 6, december, and, then, signed, into, law, by, the, king, before, a, solemn, meeting, of, the, cortes, an, attempted, military, coup, known, as, 23, f, occurred, on, 23, february, 1981, when, the, cortes, were, seized, by, members, of, the, guardia, civil, in, the, parliamentary, chamber, during, the, coup, the, king, wearing, his, uniform, as, captain, general, of, the, armed, forces, gave, a, public, television, broadcast, calling, for, unambiguous, support, for, the, legitimate, democratic, government, the, broadcast, is, believed, to, have, been, a, major, factor, in, foiling, the, coup, the, coup, leaders, had, promised, many, of, their, potential, supporters, that, they, were, acting, in, the, king, s, name, and, with, his, approval, but, were, unable, to, demonstrate, either, and, the, broadcast, coming, just, after, midnight, on, the, night, of, the, coup, definitively, showed, the, king, s, opposition, to, the, coup, makers, when, juan, carlos, became, king, communist, leader, santiago, carrillo, had, nicknamed, him, juan, carlos, the, brief, predicting, that, the, monarchy, would, soon, be, swept, away, with, the, other, remnants, of, the, franco, era, after, the, collapse, of, the, attempted, coup, however, in, an, emotional, statement, carrillo, remarked, today, we, are, all, monarchists, public, support, for, the, monarchy, among, democrats, and, leftists, which, had, been, limited, before, 1981, increased, significantly, following, the, king, s, handling, of, the, coup, however, this, event, remains, controversial, and, has, led, to, several, alternative, theories, that, cast, doubt, on, the, sincerity, of, the, king, s, defense, of, democracy, the, king, had, close, ties, with, the, leader, of, the, rebellion, who, had, served, him, as, secretary, general, of, the, royal, household, above, all, juan, carlos, and, the, main, political, parties, were, aware, of, a, plan, to, put, general, alfonso, armada, in, charge, of, the, government, particularly, in, order, to, crack, down, on, the, basque, independence, organization, euskadi, ta, askatasuna, eta, although, juan, carlos, strongly, condemned, the, coup, attempt, more, than, six, hours, after, the, armed, guards, invaded, congress, it, is, still, difficult, to, establish, whether, he, acted, out, of, democratic, conviction, or, because, the, operation, was, not, going, as, well, as, expected, with, little, support, the, reasons, for, the, trial, of, the, coup, plotters, are, still, classified, the, victory, of, the, psoe, in, 1982, under, gonz, lez, marked, the, effective, end, of, the, king, s, active, involvement, in, spanish, politics, gonz, lez, governed, for, 14, years, longer, than, any, other, democratically, elected, prime, minister, his, administration, helped, consolidate, spanish, democracy, and, thus, maintained, the, stability, of, the, nation, on, paper, juan, carlos, retained, fairly, extensive, reserve, powers, he, was, the, guardian, of, the, constitution, and, was, responsible, for, ensuring, that, it, was, obeyed, in, practice, since, the, passage, of, the, constitution, and, especially, since, 1982, he, took, a, mostly, non, partisan, and, representative, role, acting, almost, entirely, on, the, advice, of, the, government, however, he, commanded, great, moral, authority, as, an, essential, symbol, of, the, country, s, unity, under, the, constitution, the, king, has, immunity, from, prosecution, in, matters, relating, to, his, official, duties, consequently, he, exercised, most, of, his, powers, through, the, ministers, his, acts, as, king, and, not, as, a, citizen, were, not, valid, unless, countersigned, by, a, minister, who, became, politically, responsible, for, the, act, in, question, as, head, of, the, spanish, state, juan, carlos, held, political, power, gave, his, opinion, and, exerted, his, influence, in, the, economic, sphere, for, example, in, the, area, of, company, mergers, or, public, policy, during, the, transition, period, analyses, journalist, ana, pardo, the, honour, of, the, royal, family, is, specifically, protected, from, insult, by, the, spanish, penal, code,

chilean, transition, to, democracy, while, he, and, the, queen, were, cheered, by, some, groups, of, indigenous, mapuches, approached, the, king, some, to, protest, past, colonialism, and, others, to, have, the, king, ratify, past, mapuche, spanish, treaties, according, to, el, pa, s, political, infighting, between, mapuches, prevented, juan, carlos, from, hosting, an, official, meeting, with, mapuche, representatives, in, july, 2000, juan, carlos, was, the, target, of, an, enraged, protester, when, former, priest, juan, mar, a, fern, ndez, y, krohn, who, had, once, attacked, pope, john, paul, ii, breached, security, and, attempted, to, approach, the, king, when, the, media, asked, juan, carlos, in, 2005, whether, he, would, endorse, the, bill, legalising, same, sex, marriage, that, was, then, being, debated, in, the, cortes, generales, he, answered, soy, el, rey, de, espa, a, y, no, el, de, b, lgica, i, am, the, king, of, spain, not, of, belgium, a, reference, to, king, baudouin, of, belgium, who, had, refused, to, sign, the, belgian, law, legalising, abortion, the, king, gave, his, royal, assent, to, law, 13, 2005, on, 1, july, 2005, the, law, legalising, same, sex,

intervention, in, his, country, s, elections, and, complained, about, some, spanish, energy, companies, working, in, nicaragua, this, was, an, unprecedented, diplomatic, incident, and, a, rare,
