epicurus, p, k, j, r, s, eh, pih, kure, s, greek, epikouros, 341, 270, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, philosopher, and, sage, who, founded, epicureanism, a, highly, influential, school, of, philosophy, he, was, born, on, the, greek, island, of, samos, to, athenian, parents, influenced, by, democritus, aristippus, pyrrho, and, possibly, the, cynics, he, turned, against, the, platonism, of, his, day, and, established, his, own, school, known, as, the, garden, in, athens, epicurus, and, his, followers, were, known, for, eating, simple, meals, and, discussing, a, wide, range, of, philosophical, subjects, he, openly, allowed, women, and, slaves, to, join, the, school, as, a, matter, of, policy, of, the, over, 300, works, said, to, have, been, written, by, epicurus, about, various, subjects, the, vast, majority, have, been, destroyed, only, three, letters, written, by, him, the, letters, to, menoeceus, pythocles, and, herodotus, and, two, collections, of, quotes, the, principal, doctrines, and, the, vatican, sayings, have, survived, intact, along, with, a, few, fragments, of, his, other, writings, as, a, result, of, his, work, s, destruction, most, knowledge, about, his, philosophy, is, due, to, later, authors, particularly, the, biographer, diogenes, la, rtius, the, epicurean, roman, poet, lucretius, and, the, epicurean, philosopher, philodemus, as, well, as, the, hostile, but, largely, accurate, accounts, by, the, pyrrhonist, philosopher, sextus, empiricus, and, the, academic, skeptic, and, statesman, cicero, epicurus, asserted, that, philosophy, s, purpose, is, to, attain, as, well, as, to, help, others, attain, happy, eudaimonic, tranquil, lives, characterized, by, ataraxia, peace, and, freedom, from, fear, and, aponia, the, absence, of, pain, he, advocated, that, people, were, best, able, to, pursue, philosophy, by, living, a, self, sufficient, life, surrounded, by, friends, he, taught, that, the, root, of, all, human, neuroses, is, denial, of, death, and, the, tendency, for, human, beings, to, assume, that, death, will, be, horrific, and, painful, which, he, claimed, causes, unnecessary, anxiety, selfish, self, protective, behaviors, and, hypocrisy, according, to, epicurus, death, is, the, end, of, both, the, body, and, the, soul, and, therefore, should, not, be, feared, epicurus, taught, that, although, the, gods, exist, they, have, no, involvement, in, human, affairs, he, taught, that, people, should, act, ethically, not, because, the, gods, punish, or, reward, them, for, their, actions, but, because, due, to, the, power, of, guilt, amoral, behavior, would, inevitably, lead, to, remorse, weighing, on, their, consciences, and, as, a, result, they, would, be, prevented, from, attaining, ataraxia, epicurus, derived, much, of, his, physics, and, cosmology, from, the, earlier, philosopher, democritus, c, 460, c, 370, bc, like, democritus, epicurus, taught, that, the, universe, is, infinite, and, eternal, and, that, all, matter, is, made, up, of, extremely, tiny, invisible, particles, known, as, atoms, all, occurrences, in, the, natural, world, are, ultimately, the, result, of, atoms, moving, and, interacting, in, empty, space, epicurus, deviated, from, democritus, by, proposing, the, idea, of, atomic, swerve, which, holds, that, atoms, may, deviate, from, their, expected, course, thus, permitting, humans, to, possess, free, will, in, an, otherwise, deterministic, universe, though, popular, epicurean, teachings, were, controversial, from, the, beginning, epicureanism, reached, the, height, of, its, popularity, during, the, late, years, of, the, roman, republic, it, died, out, in, late, antiquity, subject, to, hostility, from, early, christianity, throughout, the, middle, ages, epicurus, was, popularly, though, inaccurately, remembered, as, a, patron, of, drunkards, whoremongers, and, gluttons, his, teachings, gradually, became, more, widely, known, in, the, fifteenth, century, with, the, rediscovery, of, important, texts, but, his, ideas, did, not, become, acceptable, until, the, seventeenth, century, when, the, french, catholic, priest, pierre, gassendi, revived, a, modified, version, of, them, which, was, promoted, by, other, writers, including, walter, charleton, and, robert, boyle, his, influence, grew, considerably, during, and, after, the, enlightenment, profoundly, impacting, the, ideas, of, major, thinkers, including, john, locke, thomas, jefferson, jeremy, bentham, and, karl, marx, epicurus, was, born, in, the, athenian, settlement, on, the, aegean, island, of, samos, in, february, 341, bc, his, parents, neocles, and, chaerestrate, were, both, athenian, born, and, his, father, was, an, athenian, citizen, epicurus, grew, up, during, the, final, years, of, the, greek, classical, period, plato, had, died, seven, years, before, epicurus, was, born, and, epicurus, was, seven, years, old, when, alexander, the, great, crossed, the, hellespont, into, persia, as, a, child, epicurus, would, have, received, a, typical, ancient, greek, education, as, such, according, to, norman, wentworth, dewitt, it, is, inconceivable, that, he, would, have, escaped, the, platonic, training, in, geometry, dialectic, and, rhetoric, epicurus, is, known, to, have, studied, under, the, instruction, of, a, samian, platonist, named, pamphilus, probably, for, about, four, years, his, letter, of, menoeceus, and, surviving, fragments, of, his, other, writings, strongly, suggest, that, he, had, extensive, training, in, rhetoric, after, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, perdiccas, expelled, the, athenian, settlers, on, samos, to, colophon, on, the, coast, of, what, is, now, turkey, epicurus, joined, his, family, there, after, the, completion, of, his, military, service, he, studied, under, nausiphanes, who, followed, the, teachings, of, democritus, and, later, those, of, pyrrho, whose, way, of, life, epicurus, greatly, admired, epicurus, s, teachings, were, heavily, influenced, by, those, of, earlier, philosophers, particularly, democritus, nonetheless, epicurus, differed, from, his, predecessors, on, several, key, points, of, determinism, and, vehemently, denied, having, been, influenced, by, any, previous, philosophers, whom, he, denounced, as, confused, instead, he, insisted, that, he, had, been, self, taught, according, to, dewitt, epicurus, s, teachings, also, show, influences, from, the, contemporary, philosophical, school, of, cynicism, the, cynic, philosopher, diogenes, of, sinope, was, still, alive, when, epicurus, would, have, been, in, athens, for, his, required, military, training, and, it, is, possible, they, may, have, met, diogenes, s, pupil, crates, of, thebes, c, 365, c, 285, bc, was, a, close, contemporary, of, epicurus, epicurus, agreed, with, the, cynics, quest, for, honesty, but, rejected, their, insolence, and, vulgarity, instead, teaching, that, honesty, must, be, coupled, with, courtesy, and, kindness, epicurus, shared, this, view, with, his, contemporary, the, comic, playwright, menander, epicurus, s, letter, to, menoeceus, possibly, an, early, work, of, his, is, written, in, an, eloquent, style, similar, to, that, of, the, athenian, rhetorician, isocrates, 436, 338, bc, but, for, his, later, works, he, seems, to, have, adopted, the, bald, intellectual, style, of, the, mathematician, euclid, epicurus, s, epistemology, also, bears, an, unacknowledged, debt, to, the, later, writings, of, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, who, rejected, the, platonic, idea, of, hypostatic, reason, and, instead, relied, on, nature, and, empirical, evidence, for, knowledge, about, the, universe, during, epicurus, s, formative, years, greek, knowledge, about, the, rest, of, the, world, was, rapidly, expanding, due, to, the, hellenization, of, the, near, east, and, the, rise, of, hellenistic, kingdoms, epicurus, s, philosophy, was, consequently, more, universal, in, its, outlook, than, those, of, his, predecessors, since, it, took, cognizance, of, non, greek, peoples, as, well, as, greeks, he, may, have, had, access, to, the, now, lost, writings, of, the, historian, and, ethnographer, megasthenes, who, wrote, during, the, reign, of, seleucus, i, nicator, ruled, 305, 281, bc, during, epicurus, s, lifetime, platonism, was, the, dominant, philosophy, in, higher, education, epicurus, s, opposition, to, platonism, formed, a, large, part, of, his, thought, over, half, of, the, forty, principal, doctrines, of, epicureanism, are, flat, contradictions, of, platonism, in, around, 311, bc, epicurus, when, he, was, around, thirty, years, old, began, teaching, in, mytilene, around, this, time, zeno, of, citium, the, founder, of, stoicism, arrived, in, athens, at, the, age, of, about, twenty, one, but, zeno, did, not, begin, teaching, what, would, become, stoicism, for, another, twenty, years, although, later, texts, such, as, the, writings, of, the, first, century, bc, roman, orator, cicero, portray, epicureanism, and, stoicism, as, rivals, this, rivalry, seems, to, have, only, emerged, after, epicurus, s, death, epicurus, s, teachings, caused, strife, in, mytilene, and, he, was, forced, to, leave, he, then, founded, a, school, in, lampsacus, before, returning, to, athens, in, c, 306, bc, where, he, remained, until, his, death, there, he, founded, the, garden, a, school, named, for, the, garden, he, owned, that, served, as, the, school, s, meeting, place, about, halfway, between, the, locations, of, two, other, schools, of, philosophy, the, stoa, and, the, academy, the, garden, was, more, than, just, a, school, it, was, a, community, of, like, minded, and, aspiring, practitioners, of, a, particular, way, of, life, the, primary, members, were, hermarchus, the, financier, idomeneus, leonteus, and, his, wife, themista, the, satirist, colotes, the, mathematician, polyaenus, of, lampsacus, and, metrodorus, of, lampsacus, the, most, famous, popularizer, of, epicureanism, his, school, was, the, first, of, the, ancient, greek, philosophical, schools, to, admit, women, as, a, rule, rather, than, an, exception, and, the, biography, of, epicurus, by, diogenes, la, rtius, lists, female, students, such, as, leontion, and, nikidion, an, inscription, on, the, gate, to, the, garden, is, recorded, by, seneca, the, younger, in, epistle, xxi, of, epistulae, morales, ad, lucilium, stranger, here, you, will, do, well, to, tarry, here, our, highest, good, is, pleasure, according, to, diskin, clay, epicurus, himself, established, a, custom, of, celebrating, his, birthday, annually, with, common, meals, befitting, his, stature, as, heros, ktistes, founding, hero, of, the, garden, he, ordained, in, his, will, annual, memorial, feasts, for, himself, on, the, same, date, 10th, of, gamelion, month, epicurean, communities, continued, this, tradition, referring, to, epicurus, as, their, saviour, soter, and, celebrating, him, as, hero, the, hero, cult, of, epicurus, may, have, operated, as, a, garden, variety, civic, religion, however, clear, evidence, of, an, epicurean, hero, cult, as, well, as, the, cult, itself, seems, buried, by, the, weight, of, posthumous, philosophical, interpretation, epicurus, never, married, and, had, no, known, children, he, was, most, likely, a, vegetarian, diogenes, la, rtius, records, that, according, to, epicurus, s, successor, hermarchus, epicurus, died, a, slow, and, painful, death, in, 270, bc, at, the, age, of, seventy, two, from, a, stone, blockage, of, his, urinary, tract, despite, being, in, immense, pain, epicurus, is, said, to, have, remained, cheerful, and, to, have, continued, to, teach, until, the, very, end, possible, insights, into, epicurus, s, death, may, be, offered, by, the, extremely, brief, epistle, to, idomeneus, included, by, diogenes, la, rtius, in, book, x, of, his, lives, and, opinions, of, eminent, philosophers, the, authenticity, of, this, letter, is, uncertain, and, it, may, be, a, later, pro, epicurean, forgery, intended, to, paint, an, admirable, portrait, of, the, philosopher, to, counter, the, large, number, of, forged, epistles, in, epicurus, s, name, portraying, him, unfavorably, i, have, written, this, letter, to, you, on, a, happy, day, to, me, which, is, also, the, last, day, of, my, life, for, i, have, been, attacked, by, a, painful, inability, to, urinate, and, also, dysentery, so, violent, that, nothing, can, be, added, to, the, violence, of, my, sufferings, but, the, cheerfulness, of, my, mind, which, comes, from, the, recollection, of, all, my, philosophical, contemplation, counterbalances, all, these, afflictions, and, i, beg, you, to, take, care, of, the, children, of, metrodorus, in, a, manner, worthy, of, the, devotion, shown, by, the, young, man, to, me, and, to, philosophy, if, authentic, this, letter, would, support, the, tradition, that, epicurus, was, able, to, remain, joyful, to, the, end, even, in, the, midst, of, his, suffering, it, would, also, indicate, that, he, maintained, a, special, concern, for, the, wellbeing, of, children, epicurus, and, his, followers, had, a, well, developed, epistemology, which, developed, as, a, result, of, their, rivalry, with, other, philosophical, schools, epicurus, wrote, a, treatise, entitled, or, rule, in, which, he, explained, his, methods, of, investigation, and, theory, of, knowledge, this, book, however, has, not, survived, nor, does, any, other, text, that, fully, and, clearly, explains, epicurean, epistemology, leaving, only, mentions, of, this, epistemology, by, several, authors, to, reconstruct, it, epicurus, rejected, the, platonic, idea, of, reason, as, a, reliable, source, of, knowledge, about, the, world, apart, from, the, senses, and, was, bitterly, opposed, to, the, pyrrhonists, and, academic, skeptics, who, not, only, questioned, the, ability, of, the, senses, to, provide, accurate, knowledge, about, the, world, but, also, whether, it, is, even, possible, to, know, anything, about, the, world, at, all, epicurus, maintained, that, the, senses, never, deceive, humans, but, that, the, senses, can, be, misinterpreted, epicurus, held, that, the, purpose, of, all, knowledge, is, to, aid, humans, in, attaining, ataraxia, he, taught, that, knowledge, is, learned, through, experiences, rather, than, innate, and, that, the, acceptance, of, the, fundamental, truth, of, the, things, a, person, perceives, is, essential, to, a, person, s, moral, and, spiritual, health, in, the, letter, to, pythocles, he, states, if, a, person, fights, the, clear, evidence, of, his, senses, he, will, never, be, able, to, share, in, genuine, tranquility, epicurus, regarded, gut, feelings, as, the, ultimate, authority, on, matters, of, morality, and, held, that, whether, a, person, feels, an, action, is, right, or, wrong, is, a, far, more, cogent, guide, to, whether, that, act, really, is, right, or, wrong, than, abstracts, maxims, strict, codified, rules, of, ethics, or, even, reason, itself, epicurus, believed, that, any, statement, that, is, not, directly, contrary, to, human, perception, can, be, considered, possibly, true, on, the, other, hand, anything, contrary, to, experience, can, be, ruled, out, as, false, epicureans, often, used, analogies, to, everyday, experience, to, support, their, argument, of, so, called, imperceptibles, which, included, anything, that, a, human, being, cannot, perceive, such, as, the, motion, of, atoms, in, line, with, this, principle, of, non, contradiction, the, epicureans, believed, that, events, in, the, natural, world, may, have, multiple, causes, that, are, all, equally, possible, and, probable, lucretius, writes, in, on, the, nature, of, things, as, translated, by, william, ellery, leonard, there, be, besides, some, thing, of, which, tis, not, enough, one, only, cause, to, state, but, rather, several, whereof, one, will, be, the, true, lo, if, thou, shouldst, espy, lying, afar, some, fellow, s, lifeless, corse, twere, meet, to, name, all, causes, of, a, death, that, cause, of, his, death, might, thereby, be, named, for, prove, thou, mayst, he, perished, not, by, steel, by, cold, nor, even, by, poison, nor, disease, yet, somewhat, of, this, sort, hath, come, to, him, we, know, and, thus, we, have, to, say, the, same, in, divers, cases, epicurus, strongly, favored, naturalistic, explanations, over, theological, ones, in, his, letter, to, pythocles, he, offers, four, different, possible, natural, explanations, for, thunder, six, different, possible, natural, explanations, for, lightning, three, for, snow, three, for, comets, two, for, rainbows, two, for, earthquakes, and, so, on, although, all, of, these, explanations, are, now, known, to, be, false, they, were, an, important, step, in, the, history, of, science, because, epicurus, was, trying, to, explain, natural, phenomena, using, natural, explanations, rather, than, resorting, to, inventing, elaborate, stories, about, gods, and, mythic, heroes, epicurus, was, a, hedonist, meaning, he, taught, that, what, is, pleasurable, is, morally, good, and, what, is, painful, is, morally, evil, he, idiosyncratically, defined, pleasure, as, the, absence, of, suffering, and, taught, that, all, humans, should, seek, to, attain, the, state, of, ataraxia, meaning, untroubledness, a, state, in, which, the, person, is, completely, free, from, all, pain, or, suffering, he, argued, that, most, of, the, suffering, which, human, beings, experience, is, caused, by, the, irrational, fears, of, death, divine, retribution, and, punishment, in, the, afterlife, in, his, letter, to, menoeceus, epicurus, explains, that, people, seek, wealth, and, power, on, account, of, these, fears, believing, that, having, more, money, prestige, or, political, clout, will, save, them, from, death, he, however, maintains, that, death, is, the, end, of, existence, that, the, terrifying, stories, of, punishment, in, the, afterlife, are, ridiculous, superstitions, and, that, death, is, therefore, nothing, to, be, feared, he, writes, in, his, letter, to, menoeceus, accustom, thyself, to, believe, that, death, is, nothing, to, us, for, good, and, evil, imply, sentience, and, death, is, the, privation, of, all, sentience, death, therefore, the, most, awful, of, evils, is, nothing, to, us, seeing, that, when, we, are, death, is, not, come, and, when, death, is, come, we, are, not, from, this, doctrine, arose, the, epicurean, epitaph, non, fui, fui, non, sum, non, curo, i, was, not, i, was, i, am, not, i, do, not, care, which, is, inscribed, on, the, gravestones, of, his, followers, and, seen, on, many, ancient, gravestones, of, the, roman, empire, this, quotation, is, often, used, today, at, humanist, funerals, the, tetrapharmakos, presents, a, summary, of, the, key, points, of, epicurean, ethics, although, epicurus, has, been, commonly, misunderstood, as, an, advocate, of, the, rampant, pursuit, of, pleasure, he, in, fact, maintained, that, a, person, can, only, be, happy, and, free, from, suffering, by, living, wisely, soberly, and, morally, he, strongly, disapproved, of, raw, excessive, sensuality, and, warned, that, a, person, must, take, into, account, whether, the, consequences, of, his, actions, will, result, in, suffering, writing, the, pleasant, life, is, produced, not, by, a, string, of, drinking, bouts, and, revelries, nor, by, the, enjoyment, of, boys, and, women, nor, by, fish, and, the, other, items, on, an, expensive, menu, but, by, sober, reasoning, he, also, wrote, that, a, single, good, piece, of, cheese, could, be, equally, pleasing, as, an, entire, feast, furthermore, epicurus, taught, that, it, is, not, possible, to, live, pleasurably, without, living, sensibly, and, nobly, and, justly, because, a, person, who, engages, in, acts, of, dishonesty, or, injustice, will, be, loaded, with, troubles, on, account, of, his, own, guilty, conscience, and, will, live, in, constant, fear, that, his, wrongdoings, will, be, discovered, by, others, a, person, who, is, kind, and, just, to, others, however, will, have, no, fear, and, will, be, more, likely, to, attain, ataraxia, epicurus, distinguished, between, two, different, types, of, pleasure, moving, pleasures, and, static, pleasures, moving, pleasures, occur, when, one, is, in, the, process, of, satisfying, a, desire, and, involve, an, active, titillation, of, the, senses, after, one, s, desires, have, been, satisfied, e, g, when, one, is, full, after, eating, the, pleasure, quickly, goes, away, and, the, suffering, of, wanting, to, fulfill, the, desire, again, returns, for, epicurus, static, pleasures, are, the, best, pleasures, because, moving, pleasures, are, always, bound, up, with, pain, epicurus, had, a, low, opinion, of, sex, and, marriage, regarding, both, as, having, dubious, value, instead, he, maintained, that, platonic, friendships, are, essential, to, living, a, happy, life, one, of, the, principal, doctrines, states, of, the, things, wisdom, acquires, for, the, blessedness, of, life, as, a, whole, far, the, greatest, is, the, possession, of, friendship, he, also, taught, that, philosophy, is, itself, a, pleasure, to, engage, in, one, of, the, quotes, from, epicurus, recorded, in, the, vatican, sayings, declares, in, other, pursuits, the, hard, won, fruit, comes, at, the, end, but, in, philosophy, delight, keeps, pace, with, knowledge, it, is, not, after, the, lesson, that, enjoyment, comes, learning, and, enjoyment, happen, at, the, same, time, epicurus, distinguishes, between, three, types, of, desires, natural, and, necessary, natural, but, unnecessary, and, vain, and, empty, natural, and, necessary, desires, include, the, desires, for, food, and, shelter, these, are, easy, to, satisfy, difficult, to, eliminate, bring, pleasure, when, satisfied, and, are, naturally, limited, going, beyond, these, limits, produces, unnecessary, desires, such, as, the, desire, for, luxury, foods, although, food, is, necessary, luxury, food, is, not, necessary, correspondingly, epicurus, advocates, a, life, of, hedonistic, moderation, by, reducing, desire, thus, eliminating, the, unhappiness, caused, by, unfulfilled, desires, vain, desires, include, desires, for, power, wealth, and, fame, these, are, difficult, to, satisfy, because, no, matter, how, much, one, gets, one, can, always, want, more, these, desires, are, inculcated, by, society, and, by, false, beliefs, about, what, we, need, they, are, not, natural, and, are, to, be, shunned, epicurus, teachings, were, introduced, into, medical, philosophy, and, practice, by, the, epicurean, doctor, asclepiades, of, bithynia, who, was, the, first, physician, who, introduced, greek, medicine, in, rome, asclepiades, introduced, the, friendly, sympathetic, pleasing, and, painless, treatment, of, patients, he, advocated, humane, treatment, of, mental, disorders, had, insane, persons, freed, from, confinement, and, treated, them, with, natural, therapy, such, as, diet, and, massages, his, teachings, are, surprisingly, modern, therefore, asclepiades, is, considered, to, be, a, pioneer, physician, in, psychotherapy, physical, therapy, and, molecular, medicine, epicurus, writes, in, his, letter, to, herodotus, not, the, historian, that, nothing, ever, arises, from, the, nonexistent, indicating, that, all, events, therefore, have, causes, regardless, of, whether, those, causes, are, known, or, unknown, similarly, he, also, writes, that, nothing, ever, passes, away, into, nothingness, because, if, an, object, that, passes, from, our, view, were, completely, annihilated, everything, in, the, world, would, have, perished, since, that, into, which, things, were, dissipated, would, be, nonexistent, he, therefore, states, the, totality, of, things, was, always, just, as, it, is, at, present, and, will, always, remain, the, same, because, there, is, nothing, into, which, it, can, change, inasmuch, as, there, is, nothing, outside, the, totality, that, could, intrude, and, effect, change, like, democritus, before, him, epicurus, taught, that, all, matter, is, entirely, made, of, extremely, tiny, particles, called, atoms, greek, atomos, meaning, indivisible, for, epicurus, and, his, followers, the, existence, of, atoms, was, a, matter, of, empirical, observation, epicurus, s, devoted, follower, the, roman, poet, lucretius, cites, the, gradual, wearing, down, of, rings, from, being, worn, statues, from, being, kissed, stones, from, being, dripped, on, by, water, and, roads, from, being, walked, on, in, on, the, nature, of, things, as, evidence, for, the, existence, of, atoms, as, tiny, imperceptible, particles, also, like, democritus, epicurus, was, a, materialist, who, taught, that, the, only, things, that, exist, are, atoms, and, void, void, occurs, in, any, place, where, there, are, no, atoms, epicurus, and, his, followers, believed, that, atoms, and, void, are, both, infinite, and, that, the, universe, is, therefore, boundless, in, on, the, nature, of, things, lucretius, argues, this, point, using, the, example, of, a, man, throwing, a, javelin, at, the, theoretical, boundary, of, a, finite, universe, he, states, that, the, javelin, must, either, go, past, the, edge, of, the, universe, in, which, case, it, is, not, really, a, boundary, or, it, must, be, blocked, by, something, and, prevented, from, continuing, its, path, but, if, that, happens, then, the, object, blocking, it, must, be, outside, the, confines, of, the, universe, as, a, result, of, this, belief, that, the, universe, and, the, number, of, atoms, in, it, are, infinite, epicurus, and, the, epicureans, believed, that, there, must, also, be, infinitely, many, worlds, within, the, universe, epicurus, taught, that, the, motion, of, atoms, is, constant, eternal, and, without, beginning, or, end, he, held, that, there, are, two, kinds, of, motion, the, motion, of, atoms, and, the, motion, of, visible, objects, both, kinds, of, motion, are, real, and, not, illusory, democritus, had, described, atoms, as, not, only, eternally, moving, but, also, eternally, flying, through, space, colliding, coalescing, and, separating, from, each, other, as, necessary, in, a, rare, departure, from, democritus, s, physics, epicurus, posited, the, idea, of, atomic, swerve, par, nklisis, latin, clinamen, one, of, his, best, known, original, ideas, according, to, this, idea, atoms, as, they, are, travelling, through, space, may, deviate, slightly, from, the, course, they, would, ordinarily, be, expected, to, follow, epicurus, s, reason, for, introducing, this, doctrine, was, because, he, wanted, to, preserve, the, concepts, of, free, will, and, ethical, responsibility, while, still, maintaining, the, deterministic, physical, model, of, atomism, lucretius, describes, it, saying, it, is, this, slight, deviation, of, primal, bodies, at, indeterminate, times, and, places, which, keeps, the, mind, as, such, from, experiencing, an, inner, compulsion, in, doing, everything, it, does, and, from, being, forced, to, endure, and, suffer, like, a, captive, in, chains, epicurus, was, first, to, assert, human, freedom, as, a, result, of, the, fundamental, indeterminism, in, the, motion, of, atoms, this, has, led, some, philosophers, to, think, that, for, epicurus, free, will, was, caused, directly, by, chance, in, his, on, the, nature, of, things, lucretius, appears, to, suggest, this, in, the, best, known, passage, on, epicurus, position, in, his, letter, to, menoeceus, however, epicurus, follows, aristotle, and, clearly, identifies, three, possible, causes, some, things, happen, of, necessity, others, by, chance, others, through, our, own, agency, aristotle, said, some, things, depend, on, us, eph, hemin, epicurus, agreed, and, said, it, is, to, these, last, things, that, praise, and, blame, naturally, attach, for, epicurus, the, swerve, of, the, atoms, simply, defeated, determinism, to, leave, room, for, autonomous, agency, in, his, letter, to, menoeceus, a, summary, of, his, own, moral, and, theological, teachings, the, first, piece, of, advice, epicurus, himself, gives, to, his, student, is, first, believe, that, a, god, is, an, indestructible, and, blessed, animal, in, accordance, with, the, general, conception, of, god, commonly, held, and, do, not, ascribe, to, god, anything, foreign, to, his, indestructibility, or, repugnant, to, his, blessedness, epicurus, maintained, that, he, and, his, followers, knew, that, the, gods, exist, because, our, knowledge, of, them, is, a, matter, of, clear, and, distinct, perception, meaning, that, people, can, empirically, sense, their, presences, he, did, not, mean, that, people, can, see, the, gods, as, physical, objects, but, rather, that, they, can, see, visions, of, the, gods, sent, from, the, remote, regions, of, interstellar, space, in, which, they, actually, reside, according, to, george, k, strodach, epicurus, could, have, easily, dispensed, of, the, gods, entirely, without, greatly, altering, his, materialist, worldview, but, the, gods, still, play, one, important, function, in, epicurus, s, theology, as, the, paragons, of, moral, virtue, to, be, emulated, and, admired, epicurus, rejected, the, conventional, greek, view, of, the, gods, as, anthropomorphic, beings, who, walked, the, earth, like, ordinary, people, fathered, illegitimate, offspring, with, mortals, and, pursued, personal, feuds, instead, he, taught, that, the, gods, are, morally, perfect, but, detached, and, immobile, beings, who, live, in, the, remote, regions, of, interstellar, space, in, line, with, these, teachings, epicurus, adamantly, rejected, the, idea, that, deities, were, involved, in, human, affairs, in, any, way, epicurus, maintained, that, the, gods, are, so, utterly, perfect, and, removed, from, the, world, that, they, are, incapable, of, listening, to, prayers, or, supplications, or, doing, virtually, anything, aside, from, contemplating, their, own, perfections, in, his, letter, to, herodotus, he, specifically, denies, that, the, gods, have, any, control, over, natural, phenomena, arguing, that, this, would, contradict, their, fundamental, nature, which, is, perfect, because, any, kind, of, worldly, involvement, would, tarnish, their, perfection, he, further, warned, that, believing, that, the, gods, control, natural, phenomena, would, only, mislead, people, into, believing, the, superstitious, view, that, the, gods, punish, humans, for, wrongdoing, which, only, instills, fear, and, prevents, people, from, attaining, ataraxia, epicurus, himself, criticizes, popular, religion, in, both, his, letter, to, menoeceus, and, his, letter, to, herodotus, but, in, a, restrained, and, moderate, tone, later, epicureans, mainly, followed, the, same, ideas, as, epicurus, believing, in, the, existence, of, the, gods, but, emphatically, rejecting, the, idea, of, divine, providence, their, criticisms, of, popular, religion, however, are, often, less, gentle, than, those, of, epicurus, himself, the, letter, to, pythocles, written, by, a, later, epicurean, is, dismissive, and, contemptuous, towards, popular, religion, and, epicurus, s, devoted, follower, the, roman, poet, lucretius, c, 99, bc, c, 55, bc, passionately, assailed, popular, religion, in, his, philosophical, poem, on, the, nature, of, things, in, this, poem, lucretius, declares, that, popular, religious, practices, not, only, do, not, instill, virtue, but, rather, result, in, misdeeds, both, wicked, and, ungodly, citing, the, mythical, sacrifice, of, iphigenia, as, an, example, lucretius, argues, that, divine, creation, and, providence, are, illogical, not, because, the, gods, do, not, exist, but, rather, because, these, notions, are, incompatible, with, the, epicurean, principles, of, the, gods, indestructibility, and, blessedness, the, later, pyrrhonist, philosopher, sextus, empiricus, c, 160, c, 210, ad, rejected, the, teachings, of, the, epicureans, specifically, because, he, regarded, them, as, theological, dogmaticists, the, epicurean, paradox, or, riddle, of, epicurus, or, epicurus, trilemma, is, a, version, of, the, problem, of, evil, lactantius, attributes, this, trilemma, to, epicurus, in, de, ira, dei, 13, 20, 21, god, he, says, either, wishes, to, take, away, evils, and, is, unable, or, he, is, able, and, is, unwilling, or, he, is, neither, willing, nor, able, or, he, is, both, willing, and, able, if, he, is, willing, and, is, unable, he, is, feeble, which, is, not, in, accordance, with, the, character, of, god, if, he, is, able, and, unwilling, he, is, envious, which, is, equally, at, variance, with, god, if, he, is, neither, willing, nor, able, he, is, both, envious, and, feeble, and, therefore, not, god, if, he, is, both, willing, and, able, which, alone, is, suitable, to, god, from, what, source, then, are, evils, or, why, does, he, not, remove, them, in, dialogues, concerning, natural, religion, 1779, david, hume, also, attributes, the, argument, to, epicurus, epicurus, s, old, questions, are, yet, unanswered, is, he, willing, to, prevent, evil, but, not, able, then, is, he, impotent, is, he, able, but, not, willing, then, is, he, malevolent, is, he, both, able, and, willing, whence, then, is, evil, no, extant, writings, of, epicurus, contain, this, argument, however, the, vast, majority, of, epicurus, s, writings, have, been, lost, and, it, is, possible, that, some, form, of, this, argument, may, have, been, found, in, his, lost, treatise, on, the, gods, which, diogenes, la, rtius, describes, as, one, of, his, greatest, works, if, epicurus, really, did, make, some, form, of, this, argument, it, would, not, have, been, an, argument, against, the, existence, of, deities, but, rather, an, argument, against, divine, providence, epicurus, s, extant, writings, demonstrate, that, he, did, believe, in, the, existence, of, deities, furthermore, religion, was, such, an, integral, part, of, daily, life, in, greece, during, the, early, hellenistic, period, that, it, is, doubtful, anyone, during, that, period, could, have, been, an, atheist, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, instead, the, greek, word, theos, meaning, without, a, god, was, used, as, a, term, of, abuse, not, as, an, attempt, to, describe, a, person, s, beliefs, epicurus, promoted, an, innovative, theory, of, justice, as, a, social, contract, justice, epicurus, said, is, an, agreement, neither, to, harm, nor, be, harmed, and, we, need, to, have, such, a, contract, in, order, to, enjoy, fully, the, benefits, of, living, together, in, a, well, ordered, society, laws, and, punishments, are, needed, to, keep, misguided, fools, in, line, who, would, otherwise, break, the, contract, but, the, wise, person, sees, the, usefulness, of, justice, and, because, of, his, limited, desires, he, has, no, need, to, engage, in, the, conduct, prohibited, by, the, laws, in, any, case, laws, that, are, useful, for, promoting, happiness, are, just, but, those, that, are, not, useful, are, not, just, principal, doctrines, 31, 40, epicurus, discouraged, participation, in, politics, as, doing, so, leads, to, perturbation, and, status, seeking, he, instead, advocated, not, drawing, attention, to, oneself, this, principle, is, epitomised, by, the, phrase, lathe, bi, sas, meaning, live, in, obscurity, get, through, life, without, drawing, attention, to, yourself, i, e, live, without, pursuing, glory, or, wealth, or, power, but, anonymously, enjoying, little, things, like, food, the, company, of, friends, etc, plutarch, elaborated, on, this, theme, in, his, essay, is, the, saying, live, in, obscurity, right, an, recte, dictum, sit, latenter, esse, vivendum, 1128c, cf, flavius, philostratus, vita, apollonii, 8, 28, 12, epicurus, was, an, extremely, prolific, writer, according, to, diogenes, la, rtius, he, wrote, around, 300, treatises, on, a, variety, of, subjects, although, more, original, writings, of, epicurus, have, survived, to, the, present, day, than, of, any, other, hellenistic, greek, philosopher, the, vast, majority, of, everything, he, wrote, has, still, been, lost, and, most, of, what, is, known, about, epicurus, s, teachings, come, from, the, writings, of, his, later, followers, particularly, the, roman, poet, lucretius, the, only, surviving, complete, works, by, epicurus, are, three, relatively, lengthy, letters, which, are, quoted, in, their, entirety, in, book, x, of, diogenes, la, rtius, s, lives, and, opinions, of, eminent, philosophers, and, two, groups, of, quotes, the, principal, doctrines, which, are, likewise, preserved, through, quotation, by, diogenes, la, rtius, and, the, vatican, sayings, preserved, in, a, manuscript, from, the, vatican, library, that, was, first, discovered, in, 1888, in, the, letter, to, herodotus, and, the, letter, to, pythocles, epicurus, summarizes, his, philosophy, on, nature, and, in, the, letter, to, menoeceus, he, summarizes, his, moral, teachings, numerous, fragments, of, epicurus, s, lost, thirty, seven, volume, treatise, on, nature, have, been, found, among, the, charred, papyrus, fragments, at, the, villa, of, the, papyri, at, herculaneum, scholars, first, began, attempting, to, unravel, and, decipher, these, scrolls, in, 1800, but, the, efforts, are, painstaking, and, are, still, ongoing, according, to, diogenes, laertius, 10, 27, 9, the, major, works, of, epicurus, include, epicureanism, was, extremely, popular, from, the, very, beginning, diogenes, la, rtius, records, that, the, number, of, epicureans, throughout, the, world, exceeded, the, populations, of, entire, cities, nonetheless, epicurus, was, not, universally, admired, and, within, his, own, lifetime, he, was, vilified, as, an, ignorant, buffoon, and, egoistic, sybarite, he, remained, the, most, simultaneously, admired, and, despised, philosopher, in, the, mediterranean, for, the, next, nearly, five, centuries, epicureanism, rapidly, spread, beyond, the, greek, mainland, all, across, the, mediterranean, world, by, the, first, century, bc, it, had, established, a, strong, foothold, in, italy, the, roman, orator, cicero, 106, 43, bc, who, deplored, epicurean, ethics, lamented, the, epicureans, have, taken, italy, by, storm, the, overwhelming, majority, of, surviving, greek, and, roman, sources, are, vehemently, negative, towards, epicureanism, and, according, to, pamela, gordon, they, routinely, depict, epicurus, himself, as, monstrous, or, laughable, many, romans, in, particular, took, a, negative, view, of, epicureanism, seeing, its, advocacy, of, the, pursuit, of, voluptas, pleasure, as, contrary, to, the, roman, ideal, of, virtus, manly, virtue, the, romans, therefore, often, stereotyped, epicurus, and, his, followers, as, weak, and, effeminate, prominent, critics, of, his, philosophy, include, prominent, authors, such, as, the, roman, stoic, seneca, the, younger, c, 4, bc, ad, 65, and, the, greek, middle, platonist, plutarch, c, 46, c, 120, who, both, derided, these, stereotypes, as, immoral, and, disreputable, gordon, characterizes, anti, epicurean, rhetoric, as, so, heavy, handed, and, misrepresentative, of, epicurus, s, actual, teachings, that, they, sometimes, come, across, as, comical, in, his, de, vita, beata, seneca, states, that, the, sect, of, epicurus, has, a, bad, reputation, and, yet, it, does, not, deserve, it, and, compares, it, to, a, man, in, a, dress, your, chastity, remains, your, virility, is, unimpaired, your, body, has, not, submitted, sexually, but, in, your, hand, is, a, tympanum, epicureanism, was, a, notoriously, conservative, philosophical, school, although, epicurus, s, later, followers, did, expand, on, his, philosophy, they, dogmatically, retained, what, he, himself, had, originally, taught, without, modifying, it, epicureans, and, admirers, of, epicureanism, revered, epicurus, himself, as, a, great, teacher, of, ethics, a, savior, and, even, a, god, his, image, was, worn, on, finger, rings, portraits, of, him, were, displayed, in, living, rooms, and, wealthy, followers, venerated, likenesses, of, him, in, marble, sculpture, his, admirers, revered, his, sayings, as, divine, oracles, carried, around, copies, of, his, writings, and, cherished, copies, of, his, letters, like, the, letters, of, an, apostle, on, the, twentieth, day, of, every, month, admirers, of, his, teachings, would, perform, a, solemn, ritual, to, honor, his, memory, at, the, same, time, opponents, of, his, teachings, denounced, him, with, vehemence, and, persistence, however, in, the, first, and, second, centuries, ad, epicureanism, gradually, began, to, decline, as, it, failed, to, compete, with, stoicism, which, had, an, ethical, system, more, in, line, with, traditional, roman, values, epicureanism, also, suffered, decay, in, the, wake, of, christianity, which, was, also, rapidly, expanding, throughout, the, roman, empire, of, all, the, greek, philosophical, schools, epicureanism, was, the, one, most, at, odds, with, the, new, christian, teachings, since, epicureans, believed, that, the, soul, was, mortal, denied, the, existence, of, an, afterlife, denied, that, the, divine, had, any, active, role, in, human, life, and, advocated, pleasure, as, the, foremost, goal, of, human, existence, as, such, christian, writers, such, as, justin, martyr, c, 100, c, 165, ad, athenagoras, of, athens, c, 133, c, 190, tertullian, c, 155, c, 240, and, clement, of, alexandria, c, 150, c, 215, arnobius, died, c, 330, and, lactantius, c, 250, c, 325, all, singled, it, out, for, the, most, vitriolic, criticism, in, spite, of, this, dewitt, argues, that, epicureanism, and, christianity, share, much, common, language, calling, epicureanism, the, first, missionary, philosophy, and, the, first, world, philosophy, both, epicureanism, and, christianity, placed, strong, emphasis, on, the, importance, of, love, and, forgiveness, and, early, christian, portrayals, of, jesus, are, often, similar, to, epicurean, portrayals, of, epicurus, dewitt, argues, that, epicureanism, in, many, ways, helped, pave, the, way, for, the, spread, of, christianity, by, helping, to, bridge, the, gap, between, greek, intellectualism, and, a, religious, way, of, life, and, shunt, the, emphasis, from, the, political, to, the, social, virtues, and, offer, what, may, be, called, a, religion, of, humanity, by, the, early, fifth, century, ad, epicureanism, was, virtually, extinct, the, christian, church, father, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, ad, declared, its, ashes, are, so, cold, that, not, a, single, spark, can, be, struck, from, them, while, the, ideas, of, plato, and, aristotle, could, easily, be, adapted, to, suit, a, christian, worldview, the, ideas, of, epicurus, were, not, nearly, as, easily, amenable, as, such, while, plato, and, aristotle, enjoyed, a, privileged, place, in, christian, philosophy, throughout, the, middle, ages, epicurus, was, not, held, in, such, esteem, information, about, epicurus, s, teachings, was, available, through, lucretius, s, on, the, nature, of, things, quotations, of, it, found, in, medieval, latin, grammars, and, florilegia, and, encyclopedias, such, as, isidore, of, seville, s, etymologiae, seventh, century, and, hrabanus, maurus, s, de, universo, ninth, century, but, there, is, little, evidence, that, these, teachings, were, systematically, studied, or, comprehended, during, the, middle, ages, epicurus, was, remembered, by, the, educated, as, a, philosopher, but, he, frequently, appeared, in, popular, culture, as, a, gatekeeper, to, the, garden, of, delights, the, proprietor, of, the, kitchen, the, tavern, and, the, brothel, he, appears, in, this, guise, in, martianus, capella, s, marriage, of, mercury, and, philology, fifth, century, john, of, salisbury, s, policraticus, 1159, john, gower, s, mirour, de, l, omme, and, geoffrey, chaucer, s, canterbury, tales, epicurus, and, his, followers, appear, in, dante, alighieri, s, inferno, in, the, sixth, circle, of, hell, where, they, are, imprisoned, in, flaming, coffins, for, having, believed, that, the, soul, dies, with, the, body, in, 1417, a, manuscript, hunter, named, poggio, bracciolini, discovered, a, copy, of, lucretius, s, on, the, nature, of, things, in, a, monastery, near, lake, constance, the, discovery, of, this, manuscript, was, met, with, immense, excitement, because, scholars, were, eager, to, analyze, and, study, the, teachings, of, classical, philosophers, and, this, previously, forgotten, text, contained, the, most, comprehensive, account, of, epicurus, s, teachings, known, in, latin, the, first, scholarly, dissertation, on, epicurus, de, voluptate, on, pleasure, by, the, italian, humanist, and, catholic, priest, lorenzo, valla, was, published, in, 1431, valla, made, no, mention, of, lucretius, or, his, poem, instead, he, presented, the, treatise, as, a, discussion, on, the, nature, of, the, highest, good, between, an, epicurean, a, stoic, and, a, christian, valla, s, dialogue, ultimately, rejects, epicureanism, but, by, presenting, an, epicurean, as, a, member, of, the, dispute, valla, lent, epicureanism, credibility, as, a, philosophy, that, deserved, to, be, taken, seriously, none, of, the, quattrocento, humanists, ever, clearly, endorsed, epicureanism, but, scholars, such, as, francesco, zabarella, 1360, 1417, francesco, filelfo, 1398, 1481, cristoforo, landino, 1424, 1498, and, leonardo, bruni, c, 1370, 1444, did, give, epicureanism, a, fairer, analysis, than, it, had, traditionally, received, and, provided, a, less, overtly, hostile, assessment, of, epicurus, himself, nonetheless, epicureanism, remained, a, pejorative, synonymous, with, extreme, egoistic, pleasure, seeking, rather, than, a, name, of, a, philosophical, school, this, reputation, discouraged, orthodox, christian, scholars, from, taking, what, others, might, regard, as, an, inappropriately, keen, interest, in, epicurean, teachings, epicureanism, did, not, take, hold, in, italy, france, or, england, until, the, seventeenth, century, even, the, liberal, religious, skeptics, who, might, have, been, expected, to, take, an, interest, in, epicureanism, evidently, did, not, tienne, dolet, 1509, 1546, only, mentions, epicurus, once, in, all, his, writings, and, fran, ois, rabelais, between, 1483, and, 1494, 1553, never, mentions, him, at, all, michel, de, montaigne, 1533, 1592, is, the, exception, to, this, trend, quoting, a, full, 450, lines, of, lucretius, s, on, the, nature, of, things, in, his, essays, his, interest, in, lucretius, however, seems, to, have, been, primarily, literary, and, he, is, ambiguous, about, his, feelings, on, lucretius, s, epicurean, worldview, during, the, protestant, reformation, the, label, epicurean, was, bandied, back, and, forth, as, an, insult, between, protestants, and, catholics, in, the, seventeenth, century, the, french, catholic, priest, and, scholar, pierre, gassendi, 1592, 1655, sought, to, dislodge, aristotelianism, from, its, position, of, the, highest, dogma, by, presenting, epicureanism, as, a, better, and, more, rational, alternative, in, 1647, gassendi, published, his, book, de, vita, et, moribus, epicuri, the, life, and, morals, of, epicurus, a, passionate, defense, of, epicureanism, in, 1649, he, published, a, commentary, on, diogenes, la, rtius, s, life, of, epicurus, he, left, syntagma, philosophicum, philosophical, compendium, a, synthesis, of, epicurean, doctrines, unfinished, at, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1655, it, was, finally, published, in, 1658, after, undergoing, revision, by, his, editors, gassendi, modified, epicurus, s, teachings, to, make, them, palatable, for, a, christian, audience, for, instance, he, argued, that, atoms, were, not, eternal, uncreated, and, infinite, in, number, instead, contending, that, an, extremely, large, but, finite, number, of, atoms, were, created, by, god, at, creation, as, a, result, of, gassendi, s, modifications, his, books, were, never, censored, by, the, catholic, church, they, came, to, exert, profound, influence, on, later, writings, about, epicurus, gassendi, s, version, of, epicurus, s, teachings, became, popular, among, some, members, of, english, scientific, circles, for, these, scholars, however, epicurean, atomism, was, merely, a, starting, point, for, their, own, idiosyncratic, adaptations, of, it, to, orthodox, thinkers, epicureanism, was, still, regarded, as, immoral, and, heretical, for, instance, lucy, hutchinson, 1620, 1681, the, first, translator, of, lucretius, s, on, the, nature, of, things, into, english, railed, against, epicurus, as, a, lunatic, dog, who, formulated, ridiculous, impious, execrable, doctrines, epicurus, s, teachings, were, made, respectable, in, england, by, the, natural, philosopher, walter, charleton, 1619, 1707, whose, first, epicurean, work, the, darkness, of, atheism, dispelled, by, the, light, of, nature, 1652, advanced, epicureanism, as, a, new, atomism, his, next, work, physiologia, epicuro, gassendo, charletoniana, or, a, fabrick, of, science, natural, upon, a, hypothesis, of, atoms, founded, by, epicurus, repaired, by, petrus, gassendus, and, augmented, by, walter, charleton, 1654, emphasized, this, idea, these, works, together, with, charleton, s, epicurus, s, morals, 1658, provided, the, english, public, with, readily, available, descriptions, of, epicurus, s, philosophy, and, assured, orthodox, christians, that, epicureanism, was, no, threat, to, their, beliefs, the, royal, society, chartered, in, 1662, advanced, epicurean, atomism, one, of, the, most, prolific, defenders, of, atomism, was, the, chemist, robert, boyle, 1627, 1691, who, argued, for, it, in, publications, such, as, the, origins, of, forms, and, qualities, 1666, experiments, notes, etc, about, the, mechanical, origin, and, production, of, divers, particular, qualities, 1675, and, of, the, excellency, and, grounds, of, the, mechanical, hypothesis, 1674, by, the, end, of, the, seventeenth, century, epicurean, atomism, was, widely, accepted, by, members, of, the, english, scientific, community, as, the, best, model, for, explaining, the, physical, world, but, it, had, been, modified, so, greatly, that, epicurus, was, no, longer, seen, as, its, original, parent, the, anglican, bishop, joseph, butler, s, anti, epicurean, polemics, in, his, fifteen, sermons, preached, at, the, rolls, chapel, 1726, and, analogy, of, religion, 1736, set, the, tune, for, what, most, orthodox, christians, believed, about, epicureanism, for, the, remainder, of, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, nonetheless, there, are, a, few, indications, from, this, time, period, of, epicurus, s, improving, reputation, epicureanism, was, beginning, to, lose, its, associations, with, indiscriminate, and, insatiable, gluttony, which, had, been, characteristic, of, its, reputation, ever, since, antiquity, instead, the, word, epicure,
