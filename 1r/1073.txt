a, number, of, shia, ismaili, sects, such, as, the, world, s, 15, million, nizaris, and, 1, 2, million, musta, lis, in, addition, to, 2, million, druze, histories, of, al, hakim, can, prove, controversial, as, diverse, views, of, his, life, and, legacy, exist, historian, paul, walker, writes, ultimately, both, views, of, him, the, mad, and, despotic, tyrant, like, germanic, and, roman, despots, irrationally, given, to, killing, those, around, him, on, a, whim, and, the, ideal, supreme, ruler, divinely, ordained, and, chosen, whose, every, action, was, just, and, righteous, were, to, persist, the, one, among, his, enemies, and, those, who, rebelled, against, him, and, the, other, in, the, hearts, of, true, believers, who, while, perhaps, perplexed, by, events, nonetheless, remained, avidly, loyal, to, him, to, the, end, appraisals, of, the, more, controversial, accounts, of, al, hakim, s, life, and, rule, have, earned, him, such, monikers, as, the, nero, of, egypt, and, the, mad, caliph, born, in, 985, ce, in, cairo, abu, ali, al, mansur, was, the, first, fatimid, ruler, to, have, been, born, in, egypt, abu, ali, al, mansur, had, been, proclaimed, as, heir, apparent, wali, al, ahd, in, 993, ce, and, succeeded, his, father, al, aziz, billah, 975, 996, at, the, age, of, eleven, on, 14, october, 996, with, the, caliphal, title, of, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, al, kim, is, reported, to, have, had, blue, eyes, flecked, with, reddish, gold, al, kim, was, born, on, thursday, 3, rabi, al, awwal, in, ad, 985, ah, 375, his, father, caliph, al, az, z, bil, l, h, had, two, consorts, one, was, an, umm, al, walad, who, is, only, known, by, the, title, as, sayyidah, al, az, ziyyah, or, al, az, zah, d, 385, 995, she, was, a, melkite, christian, whose, two, brothers, were, appointed, patriarchs, of, the, melkite, church, by, caliph, al, az, z, different, sources, say, either, one, of, her, brothers, or, her, father, was, sent, by, al, az, z, as, an, ambassador, to, sicily, al, az, zah, is, considered, to, be, the, mother, of, sitt, al, mulk, one, of, the, most, famous, women, in, islamic, history, who, had, a, stormy, relationship, with, her, half, brother, al, kim, and, may, have, had, him, assassinated, some, such, as, the, crusader, chronicler, william, of, tyre, claimed, that, al, az, zah, was, also, the, mother, of, caliph, al, kim, though, most, historians, dismiss, this, william, of, tyre, went, so, far, as, to, claim, that, al, kim, s, destruction, of, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, 1009, was, due, to, his, eagerness, to, disprove, taunts, that, he, was, a, christian, born, of, a, christian, woman, by, contrast, the, chronicler, al, musabbihi, recounts, that, in, 981, al, kim, s, muslim, mother, sought, the, aid, of, an, imprisoned, islamic, sage, named, ibn, al, washa, and, asked, him, to, pray, for, her, son, who, had, fallen, ill, the, sage, wrote, the, entire, qur, an, in, the, inner, surface, of, a, bowl, and, bade, her, wash, her, son, out, of, it, when, al, kim, recovered, she, demanded, the, release, of, the, sage, in, gratitude, her, request, was, granted, and, the, sage, and, his, associates, were, freed, from, prison, druze, sources, claim, that, al, kim, s, mother, was, the, daughter, of, abdu, l, l, h, one, of, al, mu, izz, li, din, allah, s, sons, and, therefore, al, az, z, s, niece, historians, such, as, delia, cortese, are, critical, of, this, claim, t, is, more, likely, that, this, woman, was, in, fact, a, wife, of, al, hakim, rather, than, his, mother, it, could, be, argued, that, the, druzes, emphasis, on, al, hakim, s, descent, from, an, endogamic, union, served, the, doctrinal, purpose, of, reinforcing, the, charisma, genealogically, transmitted, with, the, holy, family, thereby, enhancing, the, political, and, doctrinal, status, they, bestow, upon, al, hakim, in, 996, al, kim, s, father, caliph, al, az, z, began, a, trip, to, visit, syria, which, was, held, by, the, fatimids, only, by, force, of, arms, and, was, under, pressure, from, the, byzantines, the, caliph, fell, ill, at, the, beginning, of, the, trip, at, bilbeis, and, lay, in, sickbed, for, several, days, he, suffered, from, stone, with, pains, in, the, bowels, when, he, felt, that, his, end, was, nearing, he, charged, qadi, muhammad, ibn, an, nu, man, and, general, ab, muhammad, al, hasan, ibn, ammar, to, take, care, of, al, kim, who, was, then, only, eleven, he, then, spoke, to, his, son, al, kim, later, recalled, the, event, i, found, him, with, nothing, on, his, body, but, rags, and, bandages, i, kissed, him, and, he, pressed, me, to, his, bosom, exclaiming, how, i, grieve, for, thee, beloved, of, my, heart, and, tears, flowed, from, his, eyes, he, then, said, go, my, master, and, play, for, i, am, well, i, obeyed, and, began, to, amuse, myself, with, sports, such, as, are, usual, with, boys, and, soon, after, god, took, him, to, himself, barjawan, then, hastened, to, me, and, seeing, me, on, the, top, of, a, sycamore, tree, exclaimed, come, down, my, boy, may, god, protect, you, and, us, all, when, i, descended, he, placed, on, my, head, the, turban, adorned, with, jewels, kissed, the, ground, before, me, and, said, hail, to, the, commander, of, the, faithful, with, the, mercy, of, god, and, his, blessing, he, then, led, me, out, in, that, attire, and, showed, me, to, all, the, people, who, kissed, the, ground, before, me, and, saluted, me, with, the, title, of, khalif, on, the, following, day, he, and, his, new, court, proceeded, from, bilbays, to, cairo, behind, the, camel, bearing, his, father, s, body, and, with, the, dead, caliph, s, feet, protruding, from, the, litter, they, arrived, shortly, before, evening, prayer, and, his, father, was, buried, the, next, evening, next, to, the, tomb, of, his, predecessor, al, mu, zz, al, kim, was, sworn, in, by, barjawan, a, white, eunuch, whom, al, az, z, had, appointed, as, ustad, tutor, because, it, had, been, unclear, whether, he, would, inherit, his, father, s, position, this, successful, transfer, of, power, was, a, demonstration, of, the, stability, of, the, fatimid, dynasty, al, hakim, s, father, had, intended, the, eunuch, barjawan, to, act, as, regent, until, al, hakim, was, old, enough, to, rule, by, himself, ibn, ammar, and, qadi, muhammad, ibn, nu, man, were, to, assist, in, the, guardianship, of, the, new, caliph, nevertheless, the, kutama, berbers, seized, the, chance, to, recover, their, dominant, position, in, the, state, which, had, eroded, under, al, aziz, due, to, the, influx, of, turkish, and, daylamite, mercenaries, from, the, islamic, east, the, mash, riqa, easterners, they, compelled, the, underage, al, hakim, to, dismiss, the, christian, vizier, sa, ibn, nestorius, who, was, executed, shortly, after, and, appoint, their, leader, ibn, ammar, to, head, the, government, with, the, title, of, w, si, a, intermediary, rather, than, full, vizier, at, the, time, the, office, of, sif, ra, secretary, of, state, was, also, combined, within, that, office, ibn, ammar, then, took, the, title, of, am, n, ad, dawla, the, one, trusted, in, the, empire, this, was, the, first, time, that, the, term, empire, was, associated, with, the, fatimid, state, ibn, ammar, s, rule, quickly, descended, into, a, berber, tyranny, he, immediately, began, staffing, the, government, with, berbers, who, engaged, in, a, virtual, pillaging, of, the, state, coffers, the, berbers, attempts, to, exclude, the, other, interest, groups, from, power, not, only, the, turks, and, the, other, ethnic, contingents, of, the, army, but, also, the, civilian, bureaucracy, whose, salary, was, cut, alienated, not, only, the, mash, riqa, but, alarmed, barjawan, as, well, barjawan, contacted, the, fatimid, governor, of, damascus, the, turk, manjutakin, and, invited, him, to, march, onto, egypt, and, depose, ibn, ammar, manjutakin, accepted, but, was, defeated, by, ibn, ammar, s, troops, under, sulayman, ibn, ja, far, ibn, falah, at, ascalon, and, taken, prisoner, barjawan, however, soon, found, a, new, ally, in, the, person, of, the, kutama, leader, jaysh, ibn, samsam, governor, of, tripoli, whom, ibn, falah, dismissed, and, replaced, with, his, own, brother, jaysh, and, barjawan, gathered, a, following, of, other, dissatisfied, berber, leaders, and, launched, an, uprising, in, cairo, in, october, 997, ibn, ammar, was, forced, to, flee, and, barjawan, replaced, him, as, w, si, a, during, his, predominance, barjawan, managed, to, balance, the, two, factions, fulfilling, the, demands, of, the, mash, riqa, while, taking, care, of, the, kutama, as, well, in, this, vein, he, pardoned, ibn, ammar, and, restored, him, his, monthly, salary, of, 500, gold, dinars, after, bajarwan, s, murder, on, 26, march, 1000, however, caliph, al, hakim, assumed, the, reins, of, government, and, launched, a, purge, of, the, fatimid, elites, during, which, ibn, ammar, and, many, of, the, other, kutama, leaders, were, executed, to, ensure, his, own, power, hakim, limited, the, authority, and, terms, of, office, of, his, wasitas, and, viziers, of, whom, there, were, more, than, 15, during, the, remaining, 20, years, of, his, caliphate, al, hakim, s, most, rigorous, and, consistent, opponent, was, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, baghdad, which, sought, to, halt, the, influence, of, ismailism, this, competition, led, to, the, baghdad, manifesto, of, 1011, in, which, the, abb, sids, claimed, that, the, line, al, kim, represented, did, not, legitimately, descend, from, al, his, diplomatic, and, missionary, vehicle, was, the, ism, l, da, wah, mission, with, its, organizational, power, center, in, cairo, he, founded, the, house, of, knowledge, in, 1004ad, which, competed, with, baghdad, s, house, of, wisdom, and, eventually, surpassed, it, becoming, the, number, 1, in, the, world, al, hakim, s, reign, was, characterized, by, a, general, unrest, the, fatimid, army, was, troubled, by, a, rivalry, between, two, opposing, factions, the, turks, and, the, berbers, tension, grew, between, the, caliph, and, his, viziers, called, was, ta, s, and, near, the, end, of, his, reign, the, druze, movement, a, religious, sect, that, deified, al, hakim, as, god, manifest, began, to, form, members, of, that, sect, were, reported, to, address, prayers, to, al, hakim, whom, they, regarded, as, a, manifestation, of, god, in, his, unity, alarmed, by, the, expansion, of, the, fatimid, dominion, the, abbasid, caliph, al, qadir, of, baghdad, adopted, retaliatory, measures, to, halt, the, spread, of, ismailism, within, the, very, seat, of, his, realm, in, particular, in, 1011, he, assembled, a, number, of, sunni, and, twelver, shiite, scholars, at, his, court, and, commanded, them, to, declare, in, a, written, document, that, hakim, and, his, predecessors, lacked, genuine, descent, from, ali, and, fatima, this, so, called, baghdad, manifesto, was, read, out, in, friday, mosques, throughout, the, abbasid, domains, accusing, the, fatimids, of, jewish, ancestry, in, addition, because, of, al, hakim, s, alleged, christian, mother, he, was, accused, of, being, over, sympathetic, to, non, muslims, giving, them, more, privileges, than, they, should, have, been, given, under, islamic, rule, such, accusations, were, manifested, through, poetry, criticizing, the, fatimids, qadir, also, commissioned, several, refutations, of, ismaili, doctrines, including, those, written, by, the, mu, tazili, ali, b, sa, id, al, istakri, 1013, hakim, confronted, numerous, difficulties, and, uprisings, during, his, relatively, long, reign, while, he, did, not, lose, any, important, territories, in, north, africa, the, ismaili, communities, there, were, attacked, by, sunni, fighters, led, by, their, influential, maliki, jurists, relations, between, the, fatimids, and, the, qarmatians, also, remained, hostile, on, the, other, hand, hakim, s, syrian, policy, was, successful, as, he, managed, to, extend, fatimid, hegemony, to, the, emirate, of, aleppo, al, hakim, upheld, diplomatic, relations, between, the, fatimid, empire, and, many, different, countries, skillful, diplomacy, was, needed, in, establishing, friendly, or, at, least, neutral, relations, with, the, byzantine, empire, which, had, expansionary, goals, in, the, early, 11th, century, the, geographically, farthest, reaching, diplomatic, mission, of, al, hakim, was, to, song, dynasty, china, the, fatimid, egyptian, sea, captain, known, as, domiyat, traveled, to, a, buddhist, pilgrimage, site, in, shandong, in, ad, 1008, it, was, on, this, mission, that, he, sought, to, present, to, the, chinese, emperor, zhenzong, of, song, gifts, from, his, ruling, caliph, al, hakim, this, reestablished, diplomatic, relations, between, egypt, and, china, that, had, been, lost, during, the, collapse, of, the, tang, dynasty, in, 907, in, the, final, years, of, his, reign, al, hakim, displayed, a, growing, inclination, toward, asceticism, and, withdrew, for, meditation, regularly, on, the, night, of, 12, 13, february, 1021, at, the, age, of, 35, al, hakim, left, for, one, of, his, regular, nocturnal, meditation, journeys, to, the, mokattam, hills, on, the, outskirts, of, cairo, but, failed, to, return, a, search, found, only, his, horse, and, bloodstained, garments, his, disappearance, has, remained, a, mystery, modern, historians, have, assessed, whether, al, hakim, s, sister, sitt, al, mulk, may, have, had, a, hand, in, his, disappearance, but, no, historic, evidence, has, emerged, that, would, implicate, her, al, mulk, would, lead, moves, to, declare, her, nephew, al, zahir, li, i, zaz, din, allah, as, his, father, s, successor, as, imam, caliph, the, heir, al, hakim, had, designated, was, removed, from, court, and, al, mulk, was, appointed, regent, for, her, 16, year, old, nephew, after, al, zahir, came, of, age, al, mulk, assumed, positions, within, his, administration, until, her, death, in, 1023, in, western, literature, he, has, been, referred, to, as, the, mad, caliph, this, title, is, largely, due, to, his, erratic, and, oppressive, behavior, concerning, religious, minorities, under, his, command, as, historian, hunt, janin, relates, al, hakim, was, known, as, the, mad, caliph, because, of, his, many, cruelties, and, eccentricities, his, persecution, of, christians, is, seen, as, a, contributing, factor, to, the, crusades, as, he, not, only, forbade, pilgrimage, to, the, holy, land, but, also, ordered, the, demolishing, of, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, in, 1009, the, church, was, reconstructed, by, his, son, and, successor, al, zahir, with, historian, michael, bonner, pointing, out, that, the, term, is, also, used, due, to, the, dramatic, difference, between, al, hakim, and, his, predecessors, and, successors, and, also, points, out, that, such, persecution, is, an, extreme, rarity, in, islam, during, this, era, in, his, capital, of, cairo, this, unbalanced, and, in, the, view, of, most, mad, caliph, raged, against, the, christians, in, particular, on, the, whole, such, episodes, remained, exceptional, like, the, episodes, of, forced, conversion, to, islam, historian, michael, foss, also, notes, this, contrast, for, more, than, three, hundred, and, fifty, years, from, the, time, when, the, caliph, omar, made, a, treaty, with, the, patriarch, sophronius, until, 1009, when, mad, al, hakim, began, attacks, on, christians, and, jews, the, city, of, jerusalem, and, the, holy, land, were, open, to, the, west, with, an, easy, welcome, and, the, way, there, was, no, more, dangerous, than, a, journey, from, paris, to, rome, soon, the, panic, was, over, in, 1037, al, mustansir, came, to, an, amicable, agreement, with, emperor, michael, iv, as, one, prominent, journal, has, noted, al, hakim, has, attracted, the, interest, of, modern, historians, more, than, any, other, member, of, the, fatimid, dynasty, because, his, eccentric, character, the, inconsistencies, and, radical, shifts, in, his, conduct, and, policies, the, extreme, austerity, of, his, personal, life, the, vindictive, and, sanguinary, ruthlessness, of, his, dealing, with, the, highest, officials, of, his, government, coupled, with, an, obsession, to, suppress, all, signs, of, corruption, and, immorality, in, public, life, his, attempted, annihilation, of, christians, and, call, for, the, systematic, destruction, of, all, christian, holy, places, in, the, middle, east, culminating, in, the, destruction, of, the, most, holy, church, of, the, resurrection, in, jerusalem, his, deification, by, a, group, of, extremist, isma, ili, missionaries, who, became, the, forerunners, and, founders, of, the, druze, religion, all, combine, to, contrast, his, reign, sharply, with, that, of, any, of, his, predecessors, and, successors, and, indeed, of, any, muslim, ruler, the, question, is, to, what, extent, his, conduct, can, be, explained, as, rationally, motivated, and, conditioned, by, the, circumstances, rather, than, as, the, inscrutable, workings, of, an, insane, mind, the, claim, that, al, hakim, was, mad, and, the, version, of, events, around, him, is, disputed, as, mere, propaganda, by, some, scholars, such, as, willi, frischaue, who, states, his, enemies, called, him, the, mad, caliph, but, he, enhanced, cairo, s, reputation, as, a, centre, of, civilization, the, writing, of, historian, heinz, halm, attempts, to, dispel, those, distorted, and, hostile, accounts, stating, that, the, anti, fatimid, tradition, tried, to, make, a, real, monster, of, this, caliph, while, p, j, vatikiotis, writes, that, persecution, of, christians, and, jews, and, the, legislation, enacted, for, that, purpose, between, 1004, and, 1020, seem, to, have, been, a, policy, with, a, justifiable, purpose, al, hakim, maintained, a, keen, interest, in, the, organization, and, operation, of, the, fatimid, ismaili, da, wa, preaching, centred, in, cairo, under, his, reign, it, was, systematically, intensified, outside, the, fatimid, dominions, especially, in, iraq, and, persia, in, iraq, the, da, is, now, concentrated, their, efforts, on, a, number, of, local, amirs, and, influential, tribal, chiefs, with, whose, support, they, aimed, to, uproot, the, abbasids, foremost, among, the, fatimid, da, is, of, this, period, operating, in, the, eastern, provinces, was, hamid, al, din, kirmani, the, most, accomplished, ismaili, theologian, philosopher, of, the, entire, fatimid, period, the, activities, of, kirmani, and, other, da, is, soon, led, to, concrete, results, in, iraq, in, 1010, the, ruler, of, mosul, kufa, and, other, towns, acknowledged, the, suzerainty, of, hakim, the, 16th, fatimid, imam, caliph, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, 996, 1021, ordered, his, da, i, harun, ibn, muhammad, in, yemen, to, give, decisions, in, light, of, da, a, im, al, islam, only, in, 1013, he, completed, the, construction, of, al, j, mi, al, anwar, begun, by, his, father, commonly, known, as, h, kim, s, mosque, over, time, it, fell, into, ruin, in, the, 1970s, the, dawoodi, bohras, an, ismaili, shia, sect, under, the, leadership, of, mohammed, burhanuddin, restored, the, then, dilapidated, mosque, using, new, building, methods, and, materials, while, maintaining, as, many, of, the, architectural, and, artistic, features, as, possible, their, attempts, received, strong, criticism, from, some, academics, conservators, and, art, historians, who, saw, the, effort, as, constructing, a, new, building, rather, than, restoration, in, the, area, of, education, and, learning, one, of, hakim, s, most, important, contributions, was, the, founding, in, 1005, of, the, d, r, al, ilm, house, of, knowledge, in, cairo, a, wide, range, of, subjects, ranging, from, the, qur, an, and, hadith, to, philosophy, and, astronomy, were, taught, at, the, d, r, al, ilm, which, was, equipped, with, a, vast, library, during, his, rule, al, hakim, provided, paper, ink, pens, and, inkstands, free, of, charge, to, all, those, who, studied, there, access, to, education, was, made, available, to, the, public, and, many, fatimid, da, is, received, at, least, part, of, their, training, in, this, major, institution, of, learning, which, served, the, ismaili, da, wa, mission, until, the, downfall, of, the, fatimid, dynasty, for, more, than, 100, years, d, r, al, ilm, distinguished, itself, as, a, center, of, learning, where, astronomers, mathematicians, grammarians, logicians, physicians, philologists, jurists, and, others, conducted, research, gave, lectures, and, collaborated, all, were, welcomed, and, it, remained, unfettered, by, political, pressures, or, partisan, influences, hakim, made, the, education, of, the, ismailis, and, the, fatimid, da, i, s, a, priority, in, his, time, various, study, sessions, majalis, were, established, in, cairo, hakim, provided, financial, support, and, endowments, for, these, educational, activities, the, private, wisdom, sessions, majalis, al, hikma, devoted, to, esoteric, ismaili, doctrines, and, reserved, exclusively, for, initiates, now, became, organized, so, as, to, be, accessible, to, different, categories, of, participants, al, hakim, himself, often, attended, these, sessions, which, were, held, at, the, fatimid, palace, the, name, majalis, al, hikma, is, still, used, by, the, druze, nizari, and, taiyabi, ismailis, as, the, name, of, the, building, in, which, their, religious, assembly, and, worship, is, carried, often, abbreviated, as, majlis, session, he, would, allow, women, to, attend, the, house, of, knowledge, to, study, so, they, could, teach, other, women, and, their, children, learning, a, wide, range, of, subjects, from, islam, to, philosophy, al, hakim, is, a, central, figure, in, the, history, of, the, druze, religious, sect, whose, eponymous, founder, ad, darazi, proclaimed, him, as, the, incarnation, of, god, in, 1018, hamza, ibn, ali, ibn, ahmad, is, considered, the, founder, of, the, druze, and, the, primary, author, of, the, druze, manuscripts, he, proclaimed, that, god, had, become, human, and, taken, the, form, of, man, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, according, to, the, religious, scholar, nissim, dana, al, hakim, s, relationship, with, other, monotheistic, religions, can, be, divided, into, three, separate, stages, from, 996, to, 1006, when, most, of, the, executive, functions, of, the, khalif, were, performed, by, his, advisors, the, shiite, al, hakim, behaved, like, the, shiite, khalifs, who, he, succeeded, exhibiting, a, hostile, attitude, with, respect, to, sunni, muslims, whereas, the, attitude, toward, people, of, the, book, jews, and, christians, was, one, of, relative, tolerance, in, exchange, for, the, jizya, tax, in, 1005, al, hakim, ordered, a, public, posting, of, curses, against, the, first, three, caliphs, abu, bakr, umar, and, uthman, and, against, aisha, wife, of, muhammad, for, denying, the, caliphate, to, muhammad, s, cousin, and, son, in, law, al, who, according, to, shia, beliefs, was, the, rightful, prophetic, successor, according, to, historian, niss, m, d, n, al, hakim, ordered, that, curses, were, registered, against, the, warrior, muawiyah, i, founder, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, and, against, others, in, the, inner, circle, of, muhammad, from, the, sahabah, the, compatriots, of, muhammad, in, the, way, of, islam, this, was, in, accordance, with, shia, practice, as, laid, out, by, muslim, scholar, ayatollah, haydari, the, followers, of, ahl, al, bayt, say, o, allah, curse, all, of, the, banu, umayya, the, shia, maintain, that, out, of, hatred, for, al, mu, awiyah, ordered, the, talbiyah, not, be, said, as, it, was, promoted, by, al, and, ordered, people, to, curse, him, sa, d, ibn, abi, waqqas, refused, to, do, so, the, shia, hold, that, mu, awiyah, and, all, of, the, umayyad, caliphs, with, the, possible, exception, of, umar, ii, were, nasibi, who, are, the, hypocrites, for, whom, hatred, of, al, is, their, religion, they, don, t, just, hate, al, but, they, worship, allah, and, seek, closeness, to, him, by, hating, al, after, only, two, years, of, posting, the, curses, al, hakim, ended, the, practice, during, this, era, al, hakim, ordered, that, the, inclusion, of, the, phrase, as, sal, h, khayr, min, an, nawm, prayer, is, preferable, to, sleep, which, followed, fajr, prayer, be, stopped, he, saw, it, as, a, sunni, addition, in, its, place, he, ordered, that, ayyi, al, khayr, al, amal, come, to, the, best, of, deeds, should, be, said, after, the, summons, was, made, he, further, forbade, the, use, of, two, prayers, sal, t, at, tar, wih, and, sal, t, ad, duha, as, they, were, believed, to, have, been, formulated, by, sunni, sages, in, 1004, al, hakim, decreed, that, the, christians, could, no, longer, celebrate, epiphany, or, easter, he, also, outlawed, the, use, of, wine, nabidh, and, even, other, intoxicating, drinks, not, made, from, grapes, fuqa, to, both, muslims, and, non, muslims, alike, this, produced, a, hardship, for, both, christians, who, used, wine, in, their, religious, rites, and, jews, who, used, it, in, their, religious, festivals, in, 1005, al, hakim, ordered, that, jews, and, christians, follow, ghiy, r, the, law, of, differentiation, in, this, case, the, mintaq, or, zunnar, belt, greek, and, im, mah, turban, both, in, black, in, addition, jews, must, wear, a, wooden, calf, necklace, and, christians, a, heavy, iron, cross, in, the, public, baths, jews, must, replace, the, calf, with, a, bell, in, addition, women, of, the, people, of, the, book, had, to, wear, two, different, coloured, shoes, one, red, and, one, black, these, remained, in, place, until, 1014, and, were, thematised, and, protested, by, the, arab, christian, poet, sulayman, al, ghazzi, in, his, diwan, following, contemporary, shiite, thinking, during, this, period, al, hakim, also, issued, many, other, restrictive, ordinances, sijillat, these, sijillat, included, outlawing, entrance, to, a, public, bath, with, uncovered, loins, forbidding, women, from, appearing, in, public, with, their, faces, uncovered, and, closing, many, clubs, and, places, of, entertainment, from, 1007, to, 1012, there, was, a, notably, tolerant, attitude, toward, the, sunnis, and, less, zeal, for, shiite, islam, while, the, attitude, with, regard, to, the, people, of, the, book, was, hostile, on, 18, october, 1009, al, hakim, ordered, the, destruction, of, the, holy, sepulchre, and, its, associated, buildings, apparently, outraged, by, what, he, regarded, as, the, fraud, practiced, by, the, monks, in, the, miraculous, descent, of, the, holy, fire, celebrated, annually, at, the, church, during, the, easter, vigil, the, chronicler, yahia, noted, that, only, those, things, that, were, too, difficult, to, demolish, were, spared, processions, were, prohibited, and, a, few, years, later, all, of, the, convents, and, churches, in, palestine, were, said, to, have, been, destroyed, or, confiscated, it, was, only, in, 1042, that, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, ix, undertook, to, reconstruct, the, holy, sepulchre, with, the, permission, of, al, hakim, s, successor, al, hakim, ultimately, allowed, the, unwilling, christian, and, jewish, converts, to, islam, to, return, to, their, faith, and, rebuild, their, ruined, houses, of, worship, indeed, from, 1012, to, 1021, al, hakim, became, more, tolerant, toward, the, jews, and, christians, and, hostile, toward, the, sunnis, ironically, he, developed, a, particularly, hostile, attitude, with, regard, to, the, muslim, shiites, it, was, during, this, period, in, the, year, 1017, that, the, unique, religion, of, the, druze, began, to, develop, as, an, independent, religion, based, on, the, revelation, kashf, of, al, hakim, as, divine, while, it, is, clear, that, hamza, ibn, ali, was, the, caliph, s, chief, d, there, are, claims, that, al, hakim, believed, in, his, own, divinity, other, scholars, disagree, with, this, assertion, of, direct, divinity, particularly, the, druze, themselves, noting, that, its, proponent, was, ad, darazi, who, according, to, some, resources, al, hakim, executed, for, shirk, letters, show, that, ad, darazi, was, trying, to, gain, control, of, the, muwahhidun, movement, and, this, claim, was, an, attempt, to, gain, support, from, the, caliph, who, instead, found, it, heretical, the, mother, of, al, hakim, s, heir, al, al, z, hir, was, the, umm, al, walad, am, na, ruqayya, daughter, to, the, late, prince, abd, allah, son, of, al, mu, izz, some, see, her, as, the, same, as, the, woman, in, the, prediction, reported, by, al, hamidi, which, held, that, in, 390, 1000, al, hakim, would, choose, an, orphan, girl, of, good, stock, brought, up, his, father, al, aziz, and, that, she, would, become, the, mother, of, his, successor, while, the, chronicler, al, maqrizi, claims, that, al, hakim, s, stepsister, sitt, al, mulk, was, hostile, to, am, na, other, sources, say, she, gave, her, and, her, child, refuge, when, they, were, fleeing, al, hakim, s, persecution, some, sources, say, al, hakim, married, the, jariya, young, female, servant, known, by, the, title, as, sayyidah, but, historians, are, unsure, if, this, is, just, another, name, for, am, na, besides, al, zahir, al, hakim, had, a, daughter, named, sitt, misr, d, 455, 1063, who, was, said, to, be, a, princess, of, generous, patronage, and, a, noble, character, the, story, of, al, hakim, s, life, inspired, presumably, through, antoine, isaac, silvestre, de, sacy, the, french, author, g, rard, de, nerval, 1808, 1855, who, recounted, his, version, of, it, histoire, du, calife, hakem, history, of, the, caliph, hakem, as, an, appendix, to, his, voyage, to, the, orient, 1851, he, is, a, major, character, in, the, prisoner, of, al, hakim,
