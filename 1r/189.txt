french, designer, opened, his, pr, t, porter, house, ysl, rive, gauche, in, 1967, where, he, was, starting, to, shift, his, focus, from, haute, couture, to, ready, to, wear, one, of, the, purposes, was, to, provide, a, wider, range, of, fashionable, styles, being, available, to, choose, from, in, the, market, as, they, were, affordable, and, cheaper, he, was, the, first, french, couturier, to, come, out, with, a, full, pr, t, porter, ready, to, wear, line, although, alicia, drake, credits, this, move, with, saint, laurent, s, wish, to, democratize, fashion, others, point, out, that, other,

stores, which, sold, the, pr, t, porter, line, opened, on, the, rue, de, tournon, in, the, 6th, arrondissement, of, paris, on, 26, september, 1966, the, first, customer, was, catherine, deneuve, he, ended, up, doing, many, costumes, for, her, in, films, such, as, heartbeat, mississippi, mermaid, and, love, to, eternity, during, the, 1970s, saint, laurent, came, to, be, considered, the, most, prominent, designer, in, the, world, adapting, his, designs, to, modern, women, s, needs, even, in, his, sometimes, lavish, russian, peasant, collections, of, the, middle, of, the, decade, the, clothes, themselves, remained, comfortable, and, wearable, he, is, credited, with, initiating, in, 1978, the, prominently, shoulder, padded, styles, that, would, characterize, the, 1980s, many, of, his, collections, were, positively, received, by, both, his, fans, and, the, press, such, as, the, autumn, 1966, collection, which, introduced, le, smoking, tailored, tuxedo, suit, and, his, 1965, mondrian, collection, other, collections, raised, controversy, such, as, his, spring, 1971, collection, which, was, inspired, by, 1940s, fashion, though, 1930s, and, 40s, revival, had, been, a, trend, among, some, london, designers, like, ossie, clark, since, the, late, sixties, and, although, saint, laurent, had, presented, a, few, 1940s, looks, late, in, the, previous, year, for, a, designer, of, his, stature, to, devote, an, entire, couture, collection, to, the, 1940s, raised, some, hackles, some, felt, it, romanticized, the, german, occupation, of, france, during, world, war, ii, which, he, did, not, experience, while, others, felt, it, brought, back, the, unattractive, utilitarianism, of, the, time, the, french, newspaper, france, soir, called, the, spring, 1971, collection, une, grande, farce, criticism, notwithstanding, saint, laurent, s, influence, was, such, that, the, collection, did, lead, to, some, general, fashion, changes, in, shoulder, and, lapel, shape, and, increased, the, popularity, of, tailored, blazers, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, saint, laurent, was, considered, one, of, paris, s, jet, set, he, was, often, seen, at, clubs, in, france, and, new, york, city, such, as, regine, s, and, studio, 54, and, was, known, to, be, both, a, heavy, drinker, and, a, frequent, user, of, cocaine, when, he, was, not, actively, supervising, the, preparation, of, a, collection, he, spent, time, at, his, villa, in, marrakech, morocco, in, the, late, 1970s, he, and, berg, bought, a, neo, gothic, villa, ch, teau, gabriel, in, benerville, sur, mer, near, deauville, france, yves, saint, laurent, was, a, great, admirer, of, marcel, proust, who, had, been, a, frequent, guest, of, gaston, gallimard, one, of, the, previous, owners, of, the, villa, when, they, bought, ch, teau, gabriel, saint, laurent, and, berg, commissioned, jacques, grange, to, decorate, it, with, themes, inspired, by, proust, s, remembrance, of, things, past, the, pr, t, porter, line, became, extremely, popular, with, the, public, if, not, with, the, critics, and, eventually, earned, many, times, more, for, saint, laurent, and, berg, than, the, haute, couture, line, however, saint, laurent, whose, health, had, been, precarious, for, years, became, erratic, under, the, pressure, of, designing, two, haute, couture, and, two, pr, t, porter, collections, every, year, he, increasingly, turned, to, alcohol, and, drugs, at, some, shows, he, could, barely, walk, down, the, runway, at, the, end, of, the, show, and, he, had, to, be, supported, by, models, following, his, 1978, introduction, of, the, big, shoulder, pad, looks, that, would, dominate, the, 1980s, he, relied, on, a, restricted, set, of, styles, based, largely, on, big, shouldered, jackets, and, narrow, skirts, and, trousers, that, didn, t, vary, much, during, the, decade, resulting, in, some, fashion, writers, bemoaning, the, loss, of, his, former, inventiveness, and, others, welcoming, the, familiarity, he, was, one, of, the, last, designers, to, give, up, big, shoulder, pads, at, the, end, of, the, eighties, after, a, disastrous, 1987, pr, t, porter, show, in, new, york, city, which, featured, us, 100, 000, jeweled, casual, jackets, only, days, after, the, black, monday, stock, market, crash, he, turned, over, the, responsibility, of, the, pr, t, porter, line, to, his, assistants, although, the, line, remained, popular, with, his, fans, it, was, soon, dismissed, as, boring, by, the, press, a, favorite, among, his, female, clientele, saint, laurent, had, numerous, muses, that, inspired, his, work, among, them, were, french, model, victoire, doutreleau, who, opened, his, first, fashion, show, in, 1962, loulou, de, la, falaise, the, daughter, of, a, french, marquis, and, an,
