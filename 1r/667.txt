cellar, of, the, bobbin, factory, it, was, too, much, for, me, i, found, myself, night, after, night, sitting, up, in, bed, trying, the, steam, gauges, fearing, at, one, time, that, the, steam, was, too, low, and, that, the, workers, above, would, complain, that, they, had, not, power, enough, and, at, another, time, that, the, steam, was, too, high, and, that, the, boiler, might, burst, in,

freeing, a, trapped, telegraph, wire, the, defeat, of, the, confederacy, required, vast, supplies, of, munitions, railroads, and, telegraph, lines, to, deliver, the, goods, the, war, demonstrated, how, integral, the, industries, were, to, union, success, in, 1864, carnegie, was, one, of, the, early, investors, in, the, columbia, oil, company, in, venango, county, pennsylvania, in, one, year,

left, the, railroads, to, devote, his, energies, to, the, ironworks, trade, carnegie, worked, to, develop, several, ironworks, eventually, forming, the, keystone, bridge, works, and, the, union, ironworks, in, pittsburgh, although, he, had, left, the, pennsylvania, railroad, company, he, remained, connected, to, its, management, namely, thomas, a, scott, and, j, edgar, thomson, he, used, his, connection, to, the, two, men, to, acquire, contracts, for, his, keystone, bridge, company, and, the, rails, produced, by, his, ironworks, he, also, gave, stock, in, his, businesses, to, scott, and, thomson, and, the, pennsylvania, was, his, best, customer, when, he, built, his, first, steel, plant, he, made, a, point, of, naming, it, after, thomson, as, well, as, having, good, business, sense, carnegie, possessed, charm, and, literary, knowledge, he, was, invited, to, many, important, social, functions, which, carnegie, exploited, to, his, advantage, carnegie, through, keystone, supplied, the, steel, for, and, owned, shares, in, the, landmark, eads, bridge, project, across, the, mississippi, river, at, st, louis, missouri, completed, 1874, this, project, was, an, important, proof, of, concept, for, steel, technology, which, marked, the, opening, of, a, new, steel, market, carnegie, believed, in, using, his, fortune, for, others, and, doing, more, than, making, money, he, wrote, i, propose, to, take, an, income, no, greater, than, 50, 000, per, annum, beyond, this, i, need, ever, earn, make, no, effort, to, increase, my, fortune, but, spend, the, surplus, each, year, for, benevolent, purposes, let, us, cast, aside, business, forever, except, for, others, let, us, settle, in, oxford, and, i, shall, get, a, thorough, education, making, the, acquaintance, of, literary, men, i, figure, that, this, will, take, three, years, active, work, i, shall, pay, especial, attention, to, speaking, in, public, we, can, settle, in, london, and, i, can, purchase, a, controlling, interest, in, some, newspaper, or, live, review, and, give, the, general, management, of, it, attention, taking, part, in, public, matters, especially, those, connected, with, education, and, improvement, of, the, poorer, classes, man, must, have, no, idol, and, the, amassing, of, wealth, is, one, of, the, worst, species, of, idolatry, no, idol, is, more, debasing, than, the, worship, of, money, whatever, i, engage, in, i, must, push, inordinately, therefore, should, i, be, careful, to, choose, that, life, which, will, be, the, most, elevating, in, its, character, to, continue, much, longer, overwhelmed, by, business, cares, and, with, most, of, my, thoughts, wholly, upon, the, way, to, make, more, money, in, the, shortest, time, must, degrade, me, beyond, hope, of, permanent, recovery, i, will, resign, business, at, thirty, five, but, during, these, ensuing, two, years, i, wish, to, spend, the, afternoons, in, receiving, instruction, and, in, reading, systematically, carnegie, made, his, fortune, in, the, steel, industry, controlling, the, most, extensive, integrated, iron, and, steel, operations, ever, owned, by, an, individual, in, the, united, states, one, of, his, two, great, innovations, was, in, the, cheap, and, efficient, mass, production, of, steel, by, adopting, and, adapting, the, bessemer, process, which, allowed, the, high, carbon, content, of, pig, iron, to, be, burnt, away, in, a, controlled, and, rapid, way, during, steel, production, steel, prices, dropped, as, a, result, and, bessemer, steel, was, rapidly, adopted, for, rails, however, it, was, not, suitable, for, buildings, and, bridges, the, second, was, in, his, vertical, integration, of, all, suppliers, of, raw, materials, in, 1883, carnegie, bought, the, rival, homestead, steel, works, which, included, an, extensive, plant, served, by, tributary, coal, and, iron, fields, a, 425, mile, long, 684, km, railway, and, a, line, of, lake, steamships, in, the, late, 1880s, carnegie, steel, was, the, largest, manufacturer, of, pig, iron, steel, rails, and, coke, in, the, world, with, a, capacity, to, produce, approximately, 2, 000, tons, of, pig, iron, per, day, by, 1889, the, u, s, output, of, steel, exceeded, that, of, the, uk, and, carnegie, owned, a, large, part, of, it, carnegie, s, empire, grew, to, include, the, j, edgar, thomson, steel, works, in, braddock, named, for, john, edgar, thomson, carnegie, s, former, boss, and, president, of, the, pennsylvania, railroad, the, pittsburgh, bessemer, steel, works, the, lucy, furnaces, the, union, iron, mills, the, union, mill, wilson, walker, county, the, keystone, bridge, works, the, hartman, steel, works, the, frick, coke, company, and, the, scotia, ore, mines, carnegie, combined, his, assets, and, those, of, his, associates, in, 1892, with, the, launching, of, the, carnegie, steel, company, carnegie, s, success, was, also, due, to, his, relationship, with, the, railroad, industries, which, not, only, relied, on, steel, for, track, but, were, also, making, money, from, steel, transport, the, steel, and, railroad, barons, worked, closely, to, negotiate, prices, instead, of, allowing, free, market, competition, besides, carnegie, s, market, manipulation, united, states, trade, tariffs, were, also, working, in, favor, of, the, steel, industry, carnegie, spent, energy, and, resources, lobbying, congress, for, a, continuation, of, favorable, tariffs, from, which, he, earned, millions, of, dollars, a, year, carnegie, tried, to, keep, this, information, concealed, but, legal, documents, released, in, 1900, during, proceedings, with, the, ex, chairman, of, carnegie, steel, henry, clay, frick, revealed, how, favorable, the, tariffs, had, been, in, 1901, carnegie, was, 65, years, of, age, and, considering, retirement, he, reformed, his, enterprises, into, conventional, joint, stock, corporations, as, preparation, for, this, john, pierpont, morgan, was, a, banker, and, america, s, most, important, financial, deal, maker, he, had, observed, how, efficiently, carnegie, produced, profits, he, envisioned, an, integrated, steel, industry, that, would, cut, costs, lower, prices, to, consumers, produce, in, greater, quantities, and, raise, wages, to, workers, to, this, end, he, needed, to, buy, out, carnegie, and, several, other, major, producers, and, integrate, them, into, one, company, thereby, eliminating, duplication, and, waste, he, concluded, negotiations, on, march, 2, 1901, and, formed, the, united, states, steel, corporation, it, was, the, first, corporation, in, the, world, with, a, market, capitalization, of, over, 1, billion, the, buyout, secretly, negotiated, by, charles, m, schwab, no, relation, to, charles, r, schwab, was, the, largest, such, industrial, takeover, in, united, states, history, to, date, the, holdings, were, incorporated, in, the, united, states, steel, corporation, a, trust, organized, by, morgan, and, carnegie, retired, from, business, his, steel, enterprises, were, bought, out, for, 303, 450, 000, carnegie, s, share, of, this, amounted, to, 225, 64, million, in, 2023, 8, 26, billion, which, was, paid, to, him, in, the, form, of, 5, 50, year, gold, bonds, the, letter, agreeing, to, sell, his, share, was, signed, on, february, 26, 1901, on, march, 2, the, circular, formally, filed, the, organization, and, capitalization, at, 1, 4, billion, 4, of, the, u, s, gross, domestic, product, at, the, time, of, the, united, states, steel, corporation, actually, completed, the, contract, the, bonds, were, to, be, delivered, within, two, weeks, to, the, hudson, trust, company, of, hoboken, new, jersey, in, trust, to, robert, a, franks, carnegie, s, business, secretary, there, a, special, vault, was, built, to, house, the, physical, bulk, of, nearly, 230, million, worth, of, bonds, carnegie, continued, his, business, career, some, of, his, literary, intentions, were, fulfilled, he, befriended, the, english, poet, matthew, arnold, the, english, philosopher, herbert, spencer, and, the, american, humorist, mark, twain, as, well, as, being, in, correspondence, and, acquaintance, with, most, of, the, u, s, presidents, statesmen, and, notable, writers, carnegie, constructed, commodious, swimming, baths, for, the, people, of, his, hometown, in, dunfermline, in, 1879, in, the, following, year, carnegie, gave, 8, 000, for, the, establishment, of, a, dunfermline, carnegie, library, in, scotland, in, 1884, he, gave, 50, 000, to, bellevue, hospital, medical, college, now, part, of, new, york, university, medical, center, to, create, a, histological, laboratory, now, called, the, carnegie, laboratory, in, 1881, carnegie, took, his, family, including, his, 70, year, old, mother, on, a, trip, to, the, united, kingdom, they, toured, scotland, by, coach, and, enjoyed, several, receptions, en, route, the, highlight, was, a, return, to, dunfermline, where, carnegie, s, mother, laid, the, foundation, stone, of, a, carnegie, library, which, he, funded, carnegie, s, criticism, of, british, society, did, not, mean, dislike, on, the, contrary, one, of, carnegie, s, ambitions, was, to, act, as, a, catalyst, for, a, close, association, between, english, speaking, peoples, to, this, end, in, the, early, 1880s, in, partnership, with, samuel, storey, he, purchased, numerous, newspapers, in, britain, all, of, which, were, to, advocate, the, abolition, of, the, monarchy, and, the, establishment, of, the, british, republic, carnegie, s, charm, aided, by, his, wealth, afforded, him, many, british, friends, including, prime, minister, william, ewart, gladstone, in, 1886, carnegie, s, younger, brother, thomas, died, at, age, 43, while, owning, steel, works, carnegie, had, purchased, at, low, cost, the, most, valuable, of, the, iron, ore, fields, around, lake, superior, following, his, tour, of, the, uk, he, wrote, about, his, experiences, in, a, book, entitled, an, american, four, in, hand, in, britain, in, 1886, carnegie, wrote, his, most, radical, work, to, date, entitled, triumphant, democracy, liberal, in, its, use, of, statistics, to, make, its, arguments, the, book, argued, his, view, that, the, american, republican, system, of, government, was, superior, to, the, british, monarchical, system, it, gave, a, highly, favorable, and, idealized, view, of, american, progress, and, criticized, the, british, royal, family, the, cover, depicted, an, upended, royal, crown, and, a, broken, scepter, the, book, created, considerable, controversy, in, the, uk, the, book, made, many, americans, appreciate, their, country, s, economic, progress, and, sold, over, 40, 000, copies, mostly, in, the, u, s, although, actively, involved,

gladstone, requested, its, publication, in, britain, where, it, appeared, as, the, gospel, of, wealth, in, the, pall, mall, gazette, carnegie, argued, that, the, life, of, a, wealthy, industrialist, should, comprise, two, parts, the, first, part, was, the, gathering, and, the, accumulation, of, wealth, the, second, part, was, for, the, subsequent, distribution, of, this, wealth, to, benevolent, causes, philanthropy, was, key, to, making, life, worthwhile, carnegie, was, a, well, regarded, writer, he, published, three, books, on, travel, in, the, aftermath, of, the, spanish, american, war, the, united, states, seemed, poised, to, annex, cuba, guam, puerto, rico, and, the, philippines, carnegie, strongly, opposed, the, idea, of, american, colonies, he, opposed, the, annexation, of, the, philippines, almost, to, the, point, of, supporting, william, jennings, bryan, against, mckinley, in, 1900, in, 1898, carnegie, tried, to, arrange, independence, for, the, philippines, as, the, conclusion, of, the, spanish, american, war, neared, the, united, states, purchased, the, philippines, from, spain, for, 20, million, to, counter, what, he, perceived, as, american, imperialism, carnegie, personally, offered, 20, million, to, the, philippines, so, that, the, filipino, people, could, purchase, their, independence, from, the, united, states, however, nothing, came, of, the, offer, in, 1898, carnegie, joined, the, american, anti, imperialist, league, in, opposition, to, the, u, s, annexation, of, the, philippines, its, membership, included, former, presidents, of, the, united, states, grover, cleveland, and, benjamin, harrison, and, literary, figures, such, as, mark, twain, carnegie, spent, his, last, years, as, a, philanthropist, from, 1901, forward, public, attention, was, turned, from, the, shrewd, business, acumen, which, had, enabled, carnegie, to, accumulate, such, a, fortune, to, the, public, spirited, way, in, which, he, devoted, himself, to, using, it, on, philanthropic, projects, he, had, written, about, his, views, on, social, subjects, and, the, responsibilities, of, great, wealth, in, triumphant, democracy, 1886, and, gospel, of, wealth, 1889, carnegie, devoted, the, rest, of, his, life, to, providing, capital, for, purposes, of, public, interest, and, social, and, educational, advancement, he, saved, letters, of, appreciation, from, those, he, helped, in, a, desk, drawer, labeled, gratitude, and, sweet, words, he, provided, 25, 000, a, year, to, the, movement, for, spelling, reform, his, organization, the,

public, libraries, throughout, the, united, states, britain, canada, new, zealand, and, mostly, other, english, speaking, countries, was, especially, prominent, in, this, special, driving, interest, of, his, carnegie, was, inspired, by, meetings, with, philanthropist, enoch, pratt, 1808, 1896, the, enoch, pratt, free, library, 1886, of, baltimore, maryland, impressed, carnegie, deeply, he, said, pratt, was, my, guide, and, inspiration, carnegie, turned, over, management, of, the, library, project, by, 1908, to, his, staff, led, by, james, bertram, 1874, 1934, the, first, carnegie, library, opened, in, 1883, in, dunfermline, his, method, was, to, provide, funds, to, build, and, equip, the, library, but, only, on, the, condition, that, the, local, authority, matched, that, by, providing, the, land, and, a, budget, for, operation, and, maintenance, to, secure, local, interest, in, 1885, he, gave, 500, 000, to, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, for, a, public, library, in, 1886, he, gave, 250,

up, the, university, of, birmingham, in, 1899, as, van, slyck, 1991, showed, during, the, last, years, of, the, 19th, century, there, was, the, increasing, adoption, of, the, idea, that, free, libraries, should, be, available, to, the, american, public, but, the, design, of, such, libraries, was, the, subject, of, prolonged, and, heated, debate, on, one, hand, the, library, profession, called, for, designs, that, supported, efficiency, in, administration, and, operation, on, the, other, wealthy, philanthropists, favored, buildings, that, reinforced, the, paternalistic, metaphor, and, enhanced, civic, pride, between, 1886, and, 1917, carnegie, reformed, both, library, philanthropy, and, library, design, encouraging, a, closer, correspondence, between, the, two, in, 1900, carnegie, gave, 2, million, to, start, the, carnegie, institute, of, technology, cit, at, pittsburgh, and, the, same, amount, in, 1902, to, create, the, carnegie, institution, at, washington, d, c,

institution, with, the, following, suggestion, to, expedite, the, construction, of, the, telescope, i, hope, the, work, at, mount, wilson, will, be, vigorously, pushed, because, i, am, so, anxious, to, hear, the, expected, results, from, it, i, should, like, to, be, satisfied, before, i, depart, that, we, are, going, to, repay, to, the, old, land, some, part, of, the, debt, we, owe, them, by, revealing, more, clearly, than, ever, to, them, the, new, heavens, the, telescope, saw, first, light, on, november, 2, 1917, with, carnegie, still, alive, in, 1901, in, scotland, he, gave, 10,

charge, of, all, his, existing, and, future, benefactions, other, than, university, benefactions, in, the, united, kingdom, he, gave, the, trustees, a, wide, discretion, and, they, inaugurated, a, policy, of, financing, rural, library, schemes, rather, than, erecting, library, buildings, and, of, assisting, the, musical, education, of, the, people, rather, than, granting, organs, to, churches, in, 1901, carnegie, also, established, large, pension, funds, for, his, former, employees, at, homestead, and, in, 1905, for, american, college, professors, the, latter, fund, evolved, into, tiaa,

palace, in, washington, as, a, home, for, the, international, bureau, of, american, republics, when, it, became, obvious, that, carnegie, could, not, give, away, his, entire, fortune, within, his, lifetime, he, established, the, carnegie, corporation, of, new, york, in, 1911, to, promote, the, advancement, and, diffusion, of, knowledge, and, understanding, and, continue, his, program, of, giving, carnegie, was, honored, for, his, philanthropy, and, support, of, the, arts, by, initiation, as, an, honorary, member, of, phi, mu, alpha, sinfonia, fraternity, on, october, 14, 1917, at, the,

south, fork, fishing, and, hunting, club, which, has, been, blamed, for, the, johnstown, flood, that, killed, 2, 209, people, in, 1889, at, the, suggestion, of, his, friend, benjamin, ruff, carnegie, s, partner, henry, clay, frick, had, formed, the, exclusive, south, fork, fishing, and, hunting, club, high, above, johnstown, pennsylvania, the, sixty, odd, club, members, were, the, leading, business, tycoons, of, western, pennsylvania, and, included, among, their, number, frick, s, best, friend, andrew, mellon, his, attorneys, philander, knox, and, james, hay, reed, as, well, as, frick, s, business, partner, carnegie, high, above, the, city, near, the, small, town, of, south, fork, the, south, fork, dam, was, originally, built, between, 1838, and, 1853, by, the, commonwealth, of, pennsylvania, as, part, of, a, canal, system, to, be, used, as, a, reservoir, for, a, canal, basin, in, johnstown, with, the, coming, of, age, of, railroads, superseding, canal, barge, transport, the, lake, was, abandoned, by, the, commonwealth, sold, to, the, pennsylvania, railroad, and, sold, again, to, private, interests, and, eventually, came, to, be, owned, by, the, south, fork, fishing, and, hunting, club, in, 1881, prior, to, the, flood, speculators, had, purchased, the, abandoned, reservoir, made, less, than, well, engineered, repairs, to, the, old, dam, raised, the, lake, level, built, cottages, and, a, clubhouse, and, created, the, south, fork, fishing, and, hunting, club, less, than, 20, miles, 32, km, downstream, from, the, dam, sat, the, city, of, johnstown, the, dam, was, 72, feet, 22, m, high, and, 931, feet, 284, m, long, between, 1881, when, the, club, was, opened, and, 1889, the, dam, frequently, sprang, leaks, and, was, patched, mostly, with, mud, and, straw, additionally, a, previous, owner, removed, and, sold, for, scrap, the, three, cast, iron, discharge, pipes, that, previously, allowed, a, controlled, release, of, water, there, had, been, some, speculation, as, to, the, dam, s, integrity, and, concerns, had, been, raised, by, the, head, of, the, cambria, iron, works, downstream, in, johnstown, such, repair, work, a, reduction, in, height, and, unusually, high, snowmelt, and, heavy, spring, rains, combined, to, cause, the, dam, to, give, way, on, may, 31, 1889, resulting, in, twenty, million, tons, of, water, sweeping, down, the, valley, as, the, johnstown, flood, when, word, of, the, dam, s, failure, was, telegraphed, to, pittsburgh, frick, and, other, members, of, the, south, fork, fishing, and, hunting, club, gathered, to, form, the, pittsburgh, relief, committee, for, assistance, to, the, flood, victims, as, well, as, determining, never, to, speak, publicly, about, the, club, or, the, flood, this, strategy, was, a, success, and, knox, and, reed, were, able, to, fend, off, all, lawsuits, that, would, have, placed, blame, upon, the, club, s, members, although, cambria, iron, and, steel, s, facilities, were, heavily, damaged, by, the, flood, they, returned, to, full, production, within, a, year, after, the, flood, carnegie, built, johnstown, a, new, library, to, replace, the, one, built, by, cambria, s, chief, legal, counsel, cyrus, elder, which, was, destroyed, in, the, flood, the, carnegie, donated, library, is, now, owned, by, the, johnstown, area, heritage, association, and, houses, the, flood, museum, the, homestead, strike, was, a, bloody, labor, confrontation, lasting, 143, days, in, 1892, one, of, the, most, serious, in, u, s, history, the, conflict, was, centered, on, carnegie, steel, s, main, plant, in, homestead, pennsylvania, and, grew, out, of, a, labor, dispute, between, the, amalgamated, association, of, iron, and, steel, workers, aa, and, the, carnegie, steel, company, carnegie, left, on, a, trip, to, scotland, before, the, unrest, peaked, in, doing, so, carnegie, left, mediation, of, the, dispute, in, the, hands, of, his, associate, and, partner, henry, clay, frick, frick, was, well, known, in, industrial, circles, for, maintaining, staunch, anti, union, sentiment, with, the, collective, bargaining, agreement, between, the, union, and, company, expiring, at, the, end, of, june, frick, and, the, leaders, of, the, local, aa, union, entered, into, negotiations, in, february, with, the, steel, industry, doing, well, and, prices, higher, the, aa, asked, for, a, wage, increase, the, aa, represented, about, 800, of, the, 3, 800, workers, at, the, plant, frick, immediately, countered, with, an, average, 22, wage, decrease, that, would, affect, nearly, half, the, union, s, membership, and, remove, a, number, of, positions, from, the, bargaining, unit, the, union, and, company, failed, to, come, to, an, agreement, and, management, locked, the, union, out, workers, considered, the, stoppage, a, lockout, by, management, and, not, a, strike, by, workers, as, such, the, workers, would, have, been, well, within, their, rights, to, protest, and, subsequent, government, action, would, have, been, a, set, of, criminal, procedures, designed, to, crush, what, was, seen, as, a, pivotal, demonstration, of, the, growing, labor, rights, movement, strongly, opposed, by, management, frick, brought, in, thousands, of, strikebreakers, to, work, the, steel, mills, and, pinkerton, agents, to, safeguard, them, on, july, 6, the, arrival, of, a, force, of, 300, pinkerton, agents, from, new, york, city, and, chicago, resulted, in, a, fight, in, which, 10, men, seven, strikers, and, three, pinkertons, were, killed, and, hundreds, were, injured, pennsylvania, governor, robert, pattison, ordered, two, brigades, of, the, state, militia, to, the, strike, site, then, allegedly, in, response, to, the, fight, between, the, striking, workers, and, the, pinkertons, anarchist, alexander, berkman, shot, at, frick, in, an, attempted, assassination, wounding, him, while, not, directly, connected, to, the, strike, berkman, was, tied, in, for, the, assassination, attempt, according, to, berkman, with, the, elimination, of, frick, responsibility, for, homestead, conditions, would, rest, with, carnegie, afterwards, the, company, successfully, resumed, operations, with, non, union, immigrant, employees, in, place, of, the, homestead, plant, workers, and, carnegie, returned, to, the, united, states, however, carnegie, s, reputation, was, permanently, damaged, by, the, homestead, events, according, to, david, nasaw, after, 1898, when, the, united, states, entered, a, war, with, spain, carnegie, increasingly, devoted, his, energy, to, supporting, pacifism, he, strongly, opposed, the, war, and, the, subsequent, imperialistic, american, takeover, of, the, philippines, when, theodore, roosevelt, became, president, in, 1901, carnegie, and, roosevelt, were, in, frequent, contact, they, exchanged, letters, communicated, through, mutual, friends, such, as, secretary, of, state, john, hay, and, met, in, person, carnegie, hoped, that, roosevelt, would, turn, the, philippines, free, not, realizing, he, was, more, of, an, imperialist, and, believer, in, warrior, virtues, than, president, mckinley, had, been, he, saluted, roosevelt, for, forcing, germany, and, britain, to, arbitrate, their, conflict, with, venezuela, in, 1903, and, especially, for, becoming, the, mediator, who, negotiated, an, end, to, the, war, between, russia, and, japan, in, 1907, 1908, roosevelt, relied, on, carnegie, for, financing, his, expedition, to, africa, in, 1909, in, return, he, asked, the, ex, president, to, mediate, the, growing, conflict, between, the, cousins, who, ruled, britain, and, germany, roosevelt, started, to, do, so, but, the, scheme, collapsed, when, king, edward, vii, suddenly, died, nasaw, argues, that, roosevelt, systematically, deceived, and, manipulated, carnegie, and, held, the, elderly, man, in, contempt, nasaw, quotes, a, private, letter, roosevelt, wrote, to, whitelaw, reid, in, 1905, tried, hard, to, like, carnegie, but, it, is, pretty, difficult, there, is, no, type, of, man, for, whom, i, feel, a, more, contemptuous, abhorrence, than, for, the, one, who, makes, a, god, of, mere, money, making, and, at, the, same, time, is, always, yelling, out, that, kind, of, utterly, stupid, condemnation, of, war, which, in, almost, every, case, springs, from, a, combination, of, defective, physical, courage, of, unmanly, shrinking, from, pain, and, effort, and, of, hopelessly, twisted, ideals, all, the, suffering, from, spanish, war, comes, far, short, of, the, suffering, preventable, and, non, preventable, among, the, operators, of, the, carnegie, steel, works, and, among, the, small, investors, during, the, time, that, carnegie, was, making, his, fortune, it, is, as, noxious, folly, to, denounce, war, per, se, as, it, is, to, denounce, business, per, se, unrighteous, war, is, a, hideous, evil, but, i, am, not, at, all, sure, that, it, is, worse, evil, than, business, unrighteousness, carnegie, did, not, want, to, marry, during, his, mother, s, lifetime, instead, choosing, to, take, care, of, her, in, her, illness, towards, the, end, of, her, life, after, she, died, in, 1886, the, 51, year, old, carnegie, married, louise, whitfield, who, was, 21, years, his, junior, in, 1897, the, couple, had, their, only, child, margaret, whom, they, named, after, carnegie, s, mother, carnegie, bought, skibo, castle, in, scotland, and, made, his, home, partly, there, and, partly, in, his, new, york, mansion, located, at, 2, east, 91st, street, at, fifth, avenue, the, building, was, completed, in, late, 1902, and, he, lived, there, until, his, death, in, 1919, his, wife, louise, continued, to, live, there, until, her, death, in, 1946, the, building, has, been, used, since, 1976, as, the, cooper, hewitt, smithsonian, design, museum, part, of, the, smithsonian, institution, the, surrounding, neighborhood, on, manhattan, s, upper, east, side, has, come, to, be, called, carnegie, hill, the, mansion, was, designated, as, a, national, historic, landmark, in, 1966, carnegie, gave, formal, allegiance, to, the, republican, party, though, he, was, said, to, be, a, violent, opponent, of, some, of, the, most, sacred, doctrines, of, the, party, in, his, final, days, carnegie, had, pneumonia, before, his, death, on, august, 11, 1919, carnegie, had, donated, 350, 695, 654, for, various, causes, the, andrew, carnegie, dictum, was, carnegie, was, involved, in, philanthropic, causes, but, he, kept, himself, away, from, religious, circles, he, wanted, to, be, identified, by, the, world, as, a, positivist, he, was, highly, influenced, in, public, life, by, john, bright, as, early, as, 1868, at, age, 33, he, drafted, a, memo, to, himself, he, wrote, the, amassing, of, wealth, is, one, of, the, worse, species, of, idolatry, no, idol, more, debasing, than, the, worship, of, money, in, order, to, avoid, degrading, himself, he, wrote, in, the, same, memo, he, would, retire, at, age, 35, to, pursue, the, practice, of, philanthropic, giving, for, the, man, who, dies, thus, rich, dies, disgraced, however, he, did, not, begin, his, philanthropic, work, in, all, earnest, until, 1881, at, age, 46, with, the, gift, of, a, library, to, his, hometown, of, dunfermline, scotland, carnegie, wrote, the, gospel, of, wealth, an, article, in, which, he, stated, his, belief, that, the, rich, should, use, their, wealth, to, help, enrich, society, in, that, article, carnegie, also, expressed, sympathy, for, the, ideas, of, progressive, taxation, and, an, estate, tax, the, growing, disposition, to, tax, more, and, more, heavily, large, estates, left, at, death, is, a, cheering, indication, of, the, growth, of, a, salutary, change, in, public, opinion, the, state, of, pennsylvania, now, takes, subject, to, some, exceptions, one, tenth, of, the, property, left, by, its, citizens, the, budget, presented, in, the, british, parliament, the, other, day, proposes, to, increase, the, death, duties, and, most, significant, of, all, the, new, tax, is, to, be, a, graduated, one, of, all, forms, of, taxation, this, seems, the, wisest, men, who, continue, hoarding, great, sums, all, their, lives, the, proper, use, of, which, for, public, ends, would, work, good, to, the, community, from, which, it, chiefly, came, should, be, made, to, feel, that, the, community, in, the, form, of, the, state, cannot, thus, be, deprived, of, its, proper, share, by, taxing, estates, heavily, at, death, the, state, marks, its, condemnation, of, the, selfish, millionaire, s, unworthy, life, the, following, is, taken, from, one, of, carnegie, s, memos, to, himself, man, does, not, live, by, bread, alone, i, have, known, millionaires, starving, for, lack, of, the, nutriment, which, alone, can, sustain, all, that, is, human, in, man, and, i, know, workmen, and, many, so, called, poor, men, who, revel, in, luxuries, beyond, the, power, of, those, millionaires, to, reach, it, is, the, mind, that, makes, the, body, rich, there, is, no, class, so, pitiably, wretched, as, that, which, possesses, money, and, nothing, else, money, can, only, be, the, useful, drudge, of, things, immeasurably, higher, than, itself, exalted, beyond, this, as, it, sometimes, is, it, remains, caliban, still, and, still, plays, the, beast, my, aspirations, take, a, higher, flight, mine, be, it, to, have, contributed, to, the, enlightenment, and, the, joys, of, the, mind, to, the, things, of, the, spirit, to, all, that, tends, to, bring, into, the, lives, of, the, toilers, of, pittsburgh, sweetness, and, light, i, hold, this, the, noblest, possible, use, of, wealth, carnegie, claimed, to, be, a, champion, of, evolutionary, thought, particularly, the, work, of, herbert, spencer, even, declaring, spencer, his, teacher, i, came, fortunately, upon, darwin, s, and, spencer, s, works, the, data, of, ethics, first, principles, social, statics, the, descent, of, man, reaching, the, pages, which, explain, how, man, has, absorbed, such, mental, foods, as, were, favorable, to, him, retaining, what, was, salutary, rejecting, what, was, deleterious, i, remember, that, light, came, as, in, a, flood, and, all, was, clear, not, only, had, i, got, rid, of, theology, and, the, supernatural, but, i, had, found, the, truth, of, evolution, all, is, well, since, all, grows, better, became, my, motto, my, true, source, of, comfort, man, was, not, created, with, an, instinct, for, his, own, degradation, but, from, the, lower, he, had, risen, to, the, higher, forms, nor, is, there, any, conceivable, end, to, his, march, to, perfection, his, face, is, turned, to, the, light, he, stands, in, the, sun, and, looks, upward, however, although, carnegie, claimed, to, be, a, disciple, of, spencer, many, of, his, actions, went, against, the, ideas, he, espoused, spencerian, evolution, was, for, individual, rights, and, against, government, interference, furthermore, spencerian, evolution, held, that, those, unfit, to, sustain, themselves, must, be, allowed, to, perish, spencer, believed, that, just, as, there, were, many, varieties, of, beetles, respectively, modified, to, existence, in, a, particular, place, in, nature, so, too, had, human, society, spontaneously, fallen, into, division, of, labour, individuals, who, survived, to, this, the, latest, and, highest, stage, of, evolutionary, progress, would, be, those, in, whom, the, power, of, self, preservation, is, the, greatest, are, the, select, of, their, generation, moreover, spencer, perceived, governmental, authority, as, borrowed, from, the, people, to, perform, the, transitory, aims, of, establishing, social, cohesion, insurance, of, rights, and, security, spencerian, survival, of, the, fittest, firmly, credits, any, provisions, made, to, assist, the, weak, unskilled, poor, and, distressed, to, be, an, imprudent, disservice, to, evolution, spencer, insisted, people, should, resist, for, the, benefit, of, collective, humanity, as, severe, fate, singles, out, the, weak, debauched, and, disabled, andrew, carnegie, s, political, and, economic, focus, during, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, was, the, defense, of, laissez, faire, economics, carnegie, emphatically, resisted, government, intrusion, in, commerce, as, well, as, government, sponsored, charities, carnegie, believed, the, concentration, of, capital, was, essential, for, societal, progress, and, should, be, encouraged, carnegie, was, an, ardent, supporter, of, commercial, survival, of, the, fittest, and, sought, to, attain, immunity, from, business, challenges, by, dominating, all, phases, of, the, steel, manufacturing, procedure, carnegie, s, determination, to, lower, costs, included, cutting, labor, expenses, as, well, in, a, notably, spencerian, manner, carnegie, argued, that, unions, impeded, the, natural, reduction, of, prices, by, pushing, up, costs, which, blocked, evolutionary, progress, carnegie, felt, that, unions, represented, the, narrow, interest, of, the, few, while, his, actions, benefited, the, entire, community, on, the, surface, andrew, carnegie, appears, to, be, a, strict, laissez, faire, capitalist, and, follower, of, herbert, spencer, often, referring, to, himself, as, a, disciple, of, spencer, conversely, carnegie, a, titan, of, industry, seems, to, embody, all, of, the, qualities, of, spencerian, survival, of, the, fittest, the, two, men, enjoyed, a, mutual, respect, for, one, another, and, maintained, a, correspondence, until, spencer, s, death, in, 1903, there, are, however, some, major, discrepancies, between, spencer, s, capitalist, evolutionary, conceptions, and, andrew, carnegie, s, capitalist, practices, spencer, wrote, that, in, production, the, advantages, of, the, superior, individual, are, comparatively, minor, and, thus, acceptable, yet, the, benefit, that, dominance, provides, those, who, control, a, large, segment, of, production, might, be, hazardous, to, competition, spencer, feared, that, an, absence, of, sympathetic, self, restraint, of, those, with, too, much, power, could, lead, to, the, ruin, of, their, competitors, he, did, not, think, free, market, competition, necessitated, competitive, warfare, furthermore, spencer, argued, that, individuals, with, superior, resources, who, deliberately, used, investment, schemes, to, put, competitors, out, of, business, were, committing, acts, of, commercial, murder, carnegie, built, his, wealth, in, the, steel, industry, by, maintaining, an, extensively, integrated, operating, system, carnegie, also, bought, out, some, regional, competitors, and, merged, with, others, usually, maintaining, the, majority, shares, in, the, companies, over, the, course, of, twenty, years, carnegie, s, steel, properties, grew, to, include, the, edgar, thomson, steel, works, the, lucy, furnace, works, the, union, iron, mills, the, homestead, works, the, keystone, bridge, works, the, hartman, steel, works, the, frick, coke, company, and, the, scotia, ore, mines, among, many, other, industry, related, assets, herbert, spencer, absolutely, was, against, government, interference, in, business, in, the, form, of, regulatory, limitations, taxes, and, tariffs, as, well, spencer, saw, tariffs, as, a, form, of, taxation, that, levied, against, the, majority, in, service, to, the, benefit, of, a, small, minority, of, manufacturers, and, artisans, despite, carnegie, s, personal, dedication, to, herbert, spencer, as, a, friend, his, adherence, to, spencer, s, political, and, economic, ideas, is, more, contentious, in, particular, it, appears, carnegie, either, misunderstood, or, intentionally, misrepresented, some, of, spencer, s, principal, arguments, spencer, remarked, upon, his, first, visit, to, carnegie, s, steel, mills, in, pittsburgh, which, carnegie, saw, as, the, manifestation, of, spencer, s, philosophy, six, months, residence, here, would, justify, suicide, the, conditions, of, human, society, create, for, this, an, imperious, demand, the, concentration, of, capital, is, a, necessity, for, meeting, the, demands, of, our, day, and, as, such, should, not, be, looked, at, askance, but, be, encouraged, there, is, nothing, detrimental, to, human, society, in, it, but, much, that, is, or, is, bound, soon, to, become, beneficial, it, is, an, evolution, from, the, heterogeneous, to, the, homogeneous, and, is, clearly, another, step, in, the, upward, path, of, development, on, the, subject, of, charity, andrew, carnegie, s, actions, diverged, in, the, most, significant, and, complex, manner, from, herbert, spencer, s, philosophies, in, his, 1854, essay, manners, and, fashion, spencer, referred, to, public, education, as, old, schemes, he, went, on, to, declare, that, public, schools, and, colleges, fill, the, heads, of, students, with, inept, useless, knowledge, and, exclude, useful, knowledge, spencer, stated, that, he, trusted, no, organization, of, any, kind, political, religious, literary, philanthropic, and, believed, that, as, they, expanded, in, influence, so, too, did, their, regulations, expand, in, addition, spencer, thought, that, as, all, institutions, grow, they, become, ever, more, corrupted, by, the, influence, of, power, and, money, the, institution, eventually, loses, its, original, spirit, and, sinks, into, a, lifeless, mechanism, spencer, insisted, that, all, forms, of, philanthropy, that, uplift, the, poor, and, downtrodden, were, reckless, and, incompetent, spencer, thought, any, attempt, to, prevent, the, really, salutary, sufferings, of, the, less, fortunate, bequeath, to, posterity, a, continually, increasing, curse, carnegie, a, self, proclaimed, devotee, of, spencer, testified, to, congress, on, february, 5, 1915, my, business, is, to, do, as, much, good, in, the, world, as, i, can, i, have, retired, from, all, other, business, carnegie, held, that, societal, progress, relied, on, individuals, who, maintained, moral, obligations, to, themselves, and, to, society, furthermore, he, believed, that, charity, supplied, the, means, for, those, who, wish, to, improve, themselves, to, achieve, their, goals, carnegie, urged, other, wealthy, people, to, contribute, to, society, in, the, form, of, parks, works, of, art, libraries, and, other, endeavors, that, improve, the, community, and, contribute, to, the, lasting, good, carnegie, also, held, a, strong, opinion, against, inherited, wealth, carnegie, believed, that, the, sons, of, prosperous, businesspersons, were, rarely, as, talented, as, their, fathers, by, leaving, large, sums, of, money, to, their, children, wealthy, business, leaders, were, wasting, resources, that, could, be, used, to, benefit, society, most, notably, carnegie, believed, that, the, future, leaders, of, society, would, rise, from, the, ranks, of, the, poor, carnegie, strongly, believed, in, this, because, he, had, risen, from, the, bottom, he, believed, the, poor, possessed, an, advantage, over, the, wealthy, because, they, receive, greater, attention, from, their, parents, and, are, taught, better, work, ethics, carnegie, and, his, family, belonged, to, the, presbyterian, church, in, the, united, states, of, america, also, known, informally, as, the, northern, presbyterian, church, in, his, early, life, carnegie, was, skeptical, of, calvinism, and, religion, as, a, whole, but, reconciled, with, it, later, in, his, life, in, his, autobiography, carnegie, describes, his, family, as, moderate, presbyterian, believers, writing, that, there, was, not, one, orthodox, presbyterian, in, his, family, various, members, of, his, family, having, somewhat, distanced, themselves, from, calvinism, some, of, them, leaning, more, towards, swedenborgianism, while, a, child, his, family, led, vigorous, theological, and, political, disputes, his, mother, avoided, the, topic, of, religion, his, father, left, the, presbyterian, church, after, a, sermon, on, infant, damnation, while, according, to, carnegie, still, remaining, very, religious, on, his, own, witnessing, sectarianism, and, strife, in, 19th, century, scotland, regarding, religion, and, philosophy, carnegie, kept, his, distance, from, organized, religion, and, theism, carnegie, instead, preferred, to, see, things, through, naturalistic, and, scientific, terms, stating, not, only, had, i, got, rid, of, the, theology, and, the, supernatural, but, i, had, found, the, truth, of, evolution, later, in, life, carnegie, s, firm, opposition, to, religion, softened, for, many, years, he, was, a, member, of, madison, avenue, presbyterian, church, pastored, from, 1905, to, 1926, by, social, gospel, exponent, henry, sloane, coffin, while, his, wife, and, daughter, belonged, to, the, brick, presbyterian, church, he, also, prepared, but, did, not, deliver, an, address, in, which, he, professed, a, belief, in, an, infinite, and, eternal, energy, from, which, all, things, proceed, records, exist, of, a, short, period, of, correspondence, around, 1912, 1913, between, carnegie, and, abdu, l, bah, the, eldest, son, of, bah, u, ll, h, founder, of, the, bah, faith, in, these, letters, one, of, which, was, published, in, the, new, york, times, in, full, text, carnegie, is, extolled, as, a, lover, of, the, world, of, humanity, and, one, of, the, founders, of, universal, peace, influenced, by, his, favorite, living, hero, in, public, life, john, bright, carnegie, started, his, efforts, in, pursuit, of, world, peace, at, a, young, age, and, supported, causes, that, opposed, military, intervention, his, motto, all, is, well, since, all, grows, better, served, not, only, as, a, good, rationalization, of, his, successful, business, career, but, also, his, view, of, international, relations, despite, his, efforts, towards, international, peace, carnegie, faced, many, dilemmas, on, his, quest, these, dilemmas, are, often, regarded, as, conflicts, between, his, view, on, international, relations, and, his, other, loyalties, throughout, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, for, example, carnegie, allowed, his, steel, works, to, fill, large, orders, of, armor, plate, for, the, building, of, an, enlarged, and, modernized, united, states, navy, but, he, opposed, american, overseas, expansion, despite, that, carnegie, served, as, a, major, donor, for, the, newly, established, international, court, of, arbitration, s, peace, palace, brainchild, of, russian, tsar, nicholas, ii, his, largest, and, in, the, long, run, most, influential, peace, organization, was, the, carnegie, endowment, for, international, peace, formed, in, 1910, with, a, 10, million, endowment, in, 1913, at, the, dedication, of, the, peace, palace, in, the, hague, carnegie, predicted, that, the, end, of, the, war, was, as, certain, to, come, and, come, soon, as, day, follows, night, in, 1914, on, the, eve, of, the, first, world, war, carnegie, founded, the, church, peace, union, cpu, a, group, of, leaders, in, religion, academia, and, politics, through, the, cpu, carnegie, hoped, to, mobilize, the, world, s, churches, religious, organizations, and, other, spiritual, and, moral, resources, to, join, in, promoting, moral, leadership, to, put, an, end, to, war, forever, for, its, inaugural, international, event, the, cpu, sponsored, a, conference, to, be, held, on, august, 1, 1914, on, the, shores, of, lake, constance, in, southern, germany, as, the, delegates, made, their, way, to, the, conference, by, train, germany, was, invading, belgium, despite, its, inauspicious, beginning, the, cpu, thrived, today, its, focus, is, on, ethics, and, it, is, known, as, the, carnegie, council, for, ethics, in, international, affairs, an, independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit, organization, whose, mission, is, to, be, the, voice, for, ethics, in, international, affairs, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, was, clearly, a, shock, to, carnegie, and, his, optimistic, view, on, world, peace, although, his, promotion, of, anti, imperialism, and, world, peace, had, all, failed, and, the, carnegie, endowment, had, not, fulfilled, his, expectations, his, beliefs, and, ideas, on, international, relations, had, helped, build, the, foundation, of, the, league, of, nations, after, his, death, which, took, world, peace, to, another, level, on, the, matter, of, american, colonial, expansion, carnegie, had, always, thought, it, is, an, unwise, gesture, for, the, united, states, he, did, not, oppose, the, annexation, of, the, hawaiian, islands, or, puerto, rico, but, he, opposed, the, annexation, of, the, philippines, carnegie, believed, that, it, involved, a, denial, of, the, fundamental, democratic, principle, and, he, also, urged, william, mckinley, to, withdraw, american, troops, and, allow, the, filipinos, to, live, with, their, independence, this, act, strongly, impressed, the, other, american, anti, imperialists, who, soon, elected, him, vice, president, of, the, anti, imperialist, league, after, he, sold, his, steel, company, in, 1901, carnegie, was, able, to, get, fully, involved, in, the, peace, cause, both, financially, and, personally, he, gave, away, much, of, his, fortunes, to, various, peacekeeping, agencies, in, order, to, keep, them, growing, when, a, friend, the, british, writer, william, t, stead, asked, him, to, create, a, new, organization, for, the, goal, of, a, peace, and, arbitration, society, his, reply, was, i, do, not, see, that, it, is, wise, to, devote, our, efforts, to, creating, another, organization, of, course, i, may, be, wrong, in, believing, that, but, i, am, certainly, not, wrong, that, if, it, were, dependent, on, any, millionaire, s, money, it, would, begin, as, an, object, of, pity, and, end, as, one, of, derision, i, wonder, that, you, do, not, see, this, there, is, nothing, that, robs, a, righteous, cause, of, its, strength, more, than, a, millionaire, s, money, its, life, is, tainted, thereby, carnegie, believed, that, it, is, the, effort, and, will, of, the, people, that, maintains, the, peace, in, international, relations, money, is, just, a, push, for, the, act, if, world, peace, depended, solely, on, financial, support, it, would, not, seem, a, goal, but, more, like, an, act, of, pity, like, stead, he, believed, that, the, united, states, and, the, british, empire, would, merge, into, one, nation, telling, him, we, are, heading, straight, to, the, re, united, states, carnegie, believed, that, the, combined, country, s, power, would, maintain, world, peace, and, disarmament, the, creation, of, the, carnegie, endowment, for, international, peace, in, 1910, was, regarded, as, a, milestone, on, the, road, to, the, ultimate, goal, of, abolition, of, war, beyond, a, gift, of, 10, million, for, peace, promotion, carnegie, also, encouraged, the, scientific, investigation, of, the, various, causes, of, war, and, the, adoption, of, judicial, methods, that, should, eventually, eliminate, them, he, believed, that, the, endowment, exists, to, promote, information, on, the, nations, rights, and, responsibilities, under, existing, international, law, and, to, encourage, other, conferences, to, codify, this, law, in, 1899, andrew, carnegie, was, awarded, american, library, association, honorary, membership, carnegie, received, the, honorary, doctor, of, laws, dll, from, the, university, of, glasgow, in, june, 1901, and, received, the,

and, beneficial, influence, and, in, recognition, of, widespread, benefactions, bestowed, on, this, and, other, lands, and, especially, in, gratitude, for, the, endowment, granted, by, him, for, the,

administer, the, andrew, carnegie, collection, of, digitized, archives, on, carnegie, s, life, by, the, standards, of, 19th, century, tycoons, carnegie, was, not, a, particularly, ruthless, man, but, a, humanitarian, with, enough, acquisitiveness, to, go, in, the, ruthless, pursuit, of, money, maybe, with, the, giving, away, of, his, money, commented, biographer, joseph, wall, he, would, justify, what, he, had, done, to, get, that, money, to, some, carnegie, represents, the, idea, of, the, american, dream, he, was, an, immigrant, from, scotland, who, came, to, america, and, became, successful, he, is, not, only, known, for, his, successes, but, his, huge, amounts, of, philanthropic, works, not, only, for, charities, but, also, to, promote, democracy, and, independence, to, colonized, countries, carnegie, was, a, frequent, contributor, to, periodicals, on, labor, issues, books, articles, pamphlets, public, speaking, collected, works, collections
