in, the, wake, of, the, time, of, troubles, the, members, believed, the, problems, of, the, time, were, the, manifestation, of, a, wrathful, god, angry, with, the, russian, people, s, lack, of,

against, the, rioters, on, 1, august, 1652, he, was, elected, patriarch, of, moscow, nikon, knew, that, he, was, rather, unpopular, with, the, nobility, and, declined, the, offer, several, times, it, was, only, with, the, utmost, difficulty, that, nikon, could, be, persuaded, to, become, the, arch, pastor, of, the, russian, church, he, gave, in, after, the, tsar, himself, and, the, boyars, fell, on, their, knees, begging, him, to, accept, he, only, yielded, after, imposing, upon, the, whole, assembly, a, solemn, oath, of, obedience, to, him, in, everything, concerning, the, dogmas, canons, and, observances, of, the, orthodox, church, when, nikon, was, appointed, ecclesiastical, reform, was, already, in, the, air, a, number, of, ecclesiastical, dignitaries, known, as, the, party, of, the, protopopes, deans, had, accepted, the, responsibility, for, the, revision, of, the, church, service, books, inaugurated, by, the, late, patriarch, joasaph, and, a, few, other, minor, rectifications, of, certain, ancient, observances, but, they, were, far, too, timid, to, attempt, anything, really, effectual, nikon, launched, bold, reforms, he, consulted, the, most, learned, of, the, greek, prelates, abroad, invited, them, to, a, consultation, at, moscow, and, finally, the, scholars, of, constantinople, and, kiev, convinced, nikon, that, the, muscovite, service, books, were, heterodox, and, that, the, icons, actually, in, use, had, very, widely, departed, from, the, ancient, constantinopolitan, models, being, for, the, most, part, imbued, with, the, frankish, and, polish, west, european, baroque, influences, nikon, criticized, severely, the, use, of, such, new, fangled, icons, he, ordered, a, house, to, house, search, for, them, to, be, made, his, soldiers, and, servants, were, charged, first, to, gouge, out, the, eyes, of, these, heretical, counterfeits, and, then, carry, them, through, the, town, in, derision, he, also, issued, an, ukase, threatening, with, the, severest, penalties, all, who, dared, to, make, or, use, such, icons, in, future, later, research, was, to, determine, that, muscovite, service, books, did, belong, to, a, different, recension, from, that, which, was, used, by, the, greeks, at, the, time, of, nikon, and, the, unrevised, muscovite, books, were, actually, older, and, more, venerable, than, the, greek, books, which, had, undergone, several, revisions, over, the, centuries, were, newer, and, contained, innovations, in, 1654, nikon, summoned, a, synod, to, re, examine, the, service, books, revised, by, the, patriarch, joasaf, and, the, majority, of, the, synod, decided, that, the, greeks, should, be, followed, rather, than, our, own, ancients, a, second, council, held, at, moscow, in, 1656, sanctioned, the, revision, of, the, service, books, as, suggested, by, the, first, council, and, anathematized, the, dissenting, minority, which, included, the, party, of, the, protopopes, and, paul, bishop, of, kolomna, the, reforms, coincided, with, a, great, plague, in, 1654, construction, of, tent, like, churches, of, which, saint, basil, s, cathedral, is, a, prime, example, was, strictly, forbidden, and, many, old, uncanonical, churches, were, demolished, to, make, way, for, new, ones, designed, in, the, old, byzantine, style, this, ruthlessness, goes, far, to, explain, the, unappeasable, hatred, with, which, the, old, believers, as, they, now, began, to, be, called, ever, afterwards, regarded, nikon, and, all, his, works, he, enriched, the, numerous, and, splendid, monasteries, which, he, built, with, valuable, libraries, his, emissaries, scoured, muscovy, and, the, orient, for, precious, greek, and, slavonic, manuscripts, both, sacred, and, profane, among, the, great, monasteries, he, founded, were, valday, iversky, monastery, the, new, jerusalem, monastery, and, kiy, island, monastery, from, 1652, to, 1658, nikon, was, not, so, much, the, minister, as, the, colleague, of, the, tsar, both, in, public, documents, and, in, private, letters, he, was, permitted, to, use, the, sovereign, title, this, was, especially, the, case, during, the, wars, with, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, 1654, 1667, when, the, tsar, was, away, from, moscow, with, his, armies, in, 1654, while, starting, on, his, great, military, campaign, the, tsar, left, nikon, at, home, as, the, chief, ruler, needless, to, say, this, created, some, considerable, resentment, among, the, high, level, boyars, nikon, made, it, his, mission, to, remove, the, church, from, secular, authority, and, permanently, separate, the, church, from, the, state, he, believed, that, the, church, and, state, should, work, in, harmony, while, remaining, separate, from, each, other, he, stated, that, there, are, two, swords, of, authority, that, is, the, spiritual, and, the, secular, and, that, the, supreme, bishop, is, higher, than, the, tsar, he, also, sought, to, organize, the, church, with, a, hierarchy, similar, to, the, state, s, with, the, patriarch, in, complete, control, on, a, personal, note, nikon, and, aleksei, officialized, their, bond, as, the, tsar, made, the, patriarch, godfather, of, all, his, children, nikon, especially, protested, sobornoye, ulozheniye, russian, legal, code, of, 1649, which, reduced, the, status, of, the, clergy, and, made, the, church, in, effect, subservient, to, the, state, also, according, to, this, code, the, taxation, of, monastery, lands, was, used, for, the, benefit, of, the, state, but, his, actions, raised, up, a, whole, host, of, enemies, against, him, and, by, the, summer, of, 1658, they, had, convinced, alexius, that, the, sovereign, patriarch, was, eclipsing, the, sovereign, tsar, alexius, suddenly, grew, cold, towards, his, own, bosom, friend, as, he, called, him, almost, as, a, test, of, wills, and, perhaps, hoping, to, dramatize, his, own, importance, and, indispensability, nikon, publicly, stripped, himself, of, his, patriarchal, vestments, in, 1658, and, went, to, live, at, the, new, jerusalem, monastery, that, he, himself, founded, in, the, town, of, istra, 40, kilometers, west, of, moscow, but, he, actually, did, not, officially, resign, from, his, position, for, nearly, two, years, tsar, alexius, and, nikon, remained, estranged, and, their, conflict, unresolved, in, february, 1660, a, synod, was, held, at, moscow, to, elect, a, new, patriarch, to, the, throne, vacant, now, for, nearly, two, years, the, synod, decided, not, only, that, a, new, patriarch, should, be, appointed, but, that, nikon, had, forfeited, both, his, archiepiscopal, rank, and, his, priests, orders, against, the, second, part, of, the, synod, s, decision, however, the, great, ecclesiastical, expert, epiphanius, slavinetsky, protested, energetically, and, ultimately, the, whole, inquiry, collapsed, the, tsar, was, unwilling, to, enforce, the, decrees, of, the, synod, being, unsure, of, its, ecclesiastical, validity, for, six, years, longer, the, russian, orthodoxy, remained, without, a, patriarch, every, year, the, question, of, nikon, s, deposition, became, more, complicated, and, confusing, almost, every, contemporary, eastern, orthodox, scholar, was, consulted, on, the, subject, and, no, two, authorities, agreed, at, last, the, matter, was, submitted, to, a, pan, orthodox, synod, in, december, 1667, nikon, was, tried, by, a, synod, of, church, officials, known, as, the, great, moscow, synod, it, was, presided, over, by, two, foreign, patriarchs, thirteen, metropolitans, nine, archbishops, five, bishops, and, thirty, two, archmandrites, the, two, patriarchs, at, the, synod, were, paisius, of, alexandria, and, macarius, iii, of, antioch, symeon, of, polotsk, was, one, of, the, key, theologians, preparing, the, documents, of, the, synod, according, to, robert, massie, during, the, proceedings, nikon, staunchly, defended, his, belief, that, the, church, s, authority, and, power, were, and, ought, to, be, supreme, however, nikon, was, rather, insisting, that, the, church, s, authority, and, power, ought, to, be, supreme, only, in, ecclesiastical, matters, on, 12, december, 1667, the, synod, pronounced, nikon, guilty, of, reviling, the, tsar, and, the, whole, muscovite, church, of, deposing, paul, bishop, of, kolomna, contrary, to, the, canons, and, of, beating, and, torturing, his, dependents, his, sentence, was, deprivation, of, all, his, sacerdotal, functions, henceforth, he, was, to, be, known, simply, as, the, monk, nikon, the, same, day, he, was, put, into, a, sledge, and, sent, as, a, prisoner, to, the, far, northern, ferapontov, monastery, however, the, very, council, which, had, deposed, him, confirmed, all, his, reforms, and, anathematized, all, who, refused, to, accept, them, like, protopope, avvakum, nikon, survived, tsar, alexis, with, whom, something, of, the, old, intimacy, had, been, resumed, in, 1671, in, 1681, the, new, tsar, fedor, alexius, s, son, on, hearing, that, nikon, was, dying, allowed, him, to, return, to, moscow, and, under, a, partial, pardon, take, up, residence, in, his, former, moscow, home, the, new, jerusalem, monastery, at, yaroslavl, on, his, way, there, after, crossing, the, kotorosl, river, he, died, in, tropino, on, 17, august, 1681, the, monastery, remained, unfinished, however, but, the, royal, family, paid, particular, attention, to, ensuring, its, completion, nikon, s, cleric, later, recorded, that, for, the, church, s, consecration, in, 1685, tserevna, tatyana, prepared, gold, and, silver, arranged, for, icons, to, be, made, and, personally, embroidered, veils, to, cover, paraphernalia, for, the, eucharist
