artist, also, active, as, a, journalist, playwright, literary, and, art, critic, composer, and, film, director, he, was, known, best, for, being, one, of, the, founders, and, central, figures, of, the, anti, establishment, dada, movement, under, the, influence, of, adrian, maniu, the, adolescent, tzara, became, interested, in, symbolism, and, co, founded, the, magazine, simbolul, with, ion, vinea, with, whom, he, also, wrote, experimental, poetry, and, painter, marcel, janco, during, world, war, i, after, briefly, collaborating, on, vinea, s, chemarea, he, joined, janco, in, switzerland, there, tzara, s, shows, at, the, cabaret, voltaire, and, zunfthaus, zur, waag, as, well, as, his, poetry, and, art, manifestos, became, a, main, feature, of, early, dadaism, his, work, represented, dada, s, nihilistic, side, in, contrast, with, the, more, moderate, approach, favored, by, hugo, ball, after, moving, to, paris, in, 1919, tzara, by, then, one, of, the, presidents, of, dada, joined, the, staff, of, litt, rature, magazine, which, marked, the, first, step, in, the, movement, s, evolution, toward, surrealism, he, was, involved, in, the, major, polemics, which, led, to, dada, s, split, defending, his, principles, against, andr, breton, and, francis, picabia, and, in, romania, against, the, eclectic, modernism, of, vinea, and, janco, this, personal, vision, on, art, defined, his, dadaist, plays, the, gas, heart, 1921, and, handkerchief, of, clouds, 1924, a, forerunner, of, automatist, techniques, tzara, eventually, aligned, himself, with, breton, s, surrealism, and, under, its, influence, wrote, his, celebrated, utopian, poem, the, approximate, man, during, the, final, part, of, his, career, tzara, combined, his, humanist, and, anti, fascist, perspective, with, a, communist, vision, joining, the, republicans, in, the, spanish, civil, war, and, the, french, resistance, during, world, war, ii, and, serving, a, term, in, the, national, assembly, having, spoken, in, favor, of, liberalization, in, the, people, s, republic, of, hungary, just, before, the, revolution, of, 1956, he, distanced, himself, from, the, french, communist, party, of, which, he, was, by, then, a, member, in, 1960, he, was, among, the, intellectuals, who, protested, against, french, actions, in, the, algerian, war, tristan, tzara, was, an, influential, author, and, performer, whose, contribution, is, credited, with, having, created, a, connection, from, cubism, and, futurism, to, the, beat, generation, situationism, and, various, currents, in, rock, music, the, friend, and, collaborator, of, many, modernist, figures, he, was, the, lover, of, dancer, maja, kruscek, in, his, early, youth, and, was, later, married, to, swedish, artist, and, poet, greta, knutson, s, samyro, a, partial, anagram, of, samy, rosenstock, was, used, by, tzara, from, his, debut, and, throughout, the, early, 1910s, a, number, of, undated, writings, which, he, probably, authored, as, early, as, 1913, bear, the, signature, tristan, ruia, and, in, summer, of, 1915, he, was, signing, his, pieces, with, the, name, tristan, in, the, 1960s, rosenstock, s, collaborator, and, later, rival, ion, vinea, claimed, that, he, was, responsible, for, coining, the, tzara, part, of, his, pseudonym, in, 1915, vinea, also, stated, that, tzara, wanted, to, keep, tristan, as, his, adopted, first, name, and, that, this, choice, had, later, attracted, him, the, infamous, pun, triste, ne, tzara, french, for, sad, donkey, tzara, this, version, of, events, is, uncertain, as, manuscripts, show, that, the, writer, may, have, already, been, using, the, full, name, as, well, as, the, variations, tristan, ara, and, tr, tzara, in, 1913, 1914, although, there, is, a, possibility, that, he, was, signing, his, texts, long, after, committing, them, to, paper, in, 1972, art, historian, serge, fauchereau, based, on, information, received, from, colomba, the, wife, of, avant, garde, poet, ilarie, voronca, recounted, that, tzara, had, explained, his, chosen, name, was, a, pun, in, romanian, trist, n, ar, meaning, sad, in, the, country, colomba, voronca, was, also, dismissing, rumors, that, tzara, had, selected, tristan, as, a, tribute, to, poet, tristan, corbi, re, or, to, richard, wagner, s, tristan, und, isolde, opera, samy, rosenstock, legally, adopted, his, new, name, in, 1925, after, filing, a, request, with, romania, s, ministry, of, the, interior, the, french, pronunciation, of, his, name, has, become, commonplace, in, romania, where, it, replaces, its, more, natural, reading, as, ara, the, land, romanian, pronunciation, tzara, was, born, in, moine, ti, bac, u, county, in, the, historical, region, of, western, moldavia, his, parents, were, jewish, romanians, who, reportedly, spoke, yiddish, as, their, first, language, his, father, filip, and, grandfather, ilie, were, entrepreneurs, in, the, forestry, business, tzara, s, mother, was, emilia, rosenstock, n, e, zibalis, owing, to, the, romanian, kingdom, s, discrimination, laws, the, rosenstocks, were, not, emancipated, and, thus, tzara, was, not, a, full, citizen, of, the, country, until, after, 1918, he, moved, to, bucharest, at, the, age, of, eleven, and, attended, the, schemitz, tierin, boarding, school, it, is, believed, that, the, young, tzara, completed, his, secondary, education, at, a, state, run, high, school, which, is, identified, as, the, saint, sava, national, college, or, as, the, sf, ntul, gheorghe, high, school, in, october, 1912, when, tzara, was, aged, sixteen, he, joined, his, friends, vinea, and, marcel, janco, in, editing, simbolul, reputedly, janco, and, vinea, provided, the, funds, like, vinea, tzara, was, also, close, to, their, young, colleague, jacques, g, costin, who, was, later, his, self, declared, promoter, and, admirer, despite, their, young, age, the, three, editors, were, able, to, attract, collaborations, from, established, symbolist, authors, active, within, romania, s, own, symbolist, movement, alongside, their, close, friend, and, mentor, adrian, maniu, an, imagist, who, had, been, vinea, s, tutor, they, included, n, davidescu, alfred, hefter, hidalgo, emil, isac, claudia, millian, ion, minulescu, i, m, ra, cu, eugeniu, sperantia, al, t, stamatiad, eugeniu, tef, nescu, est, and, constantin, t, stoika, as, well, as, journalist, and, lawyer, poldi, chapier, in, its, inaugural, issue, the, journal, even, printed, a, poem, by, one, of, the, leading, figures, in, romanian, symbolism, alexandru, macedonski, simbolul, also, featured, illustrations, by, maniu, millian, and, iosif, iser, although, the, magazine, ceased, print, in, december, 1912, it, played, an, important, part, in, shaping, romanian, literature, of, the, period, literary, historian, paul, cernat, sees, simbolul, as, a, main, stage, in, romania, s, modernism, and, credits, it, with, having, brought, about, the, first, changes, from, symbolism, to, the, radical, avant, garde, also, according, to, cernat, the, collaboration, between, samyro, vinea, and, janco, was, an, early, instance, of, literature, becoming, an, interface, between, arts, which, had, for, its, contemporary, equivalent, the, collaboration, between, iser, and, writers, such, as, ion, minulescu, and, tudor, arghezi, although, maniu, parted, with, the, group, and, sought, a, change, in, style, which, brought, him, closer, to, traditionalist, tenets, tzara, janco, and, vinea, continued, their, collaboration, between, 1913, and, 1915, they, were, frequently, vacationing, together, either, on, the, black, sea, coast, or, at, the, rosenstock, family, property, in, g, rceni, vaslui, county, during, this, time, vinea, and, samyro, wrote, poems, with, similar, themes, and, alluding, to, one, another, tzara, s, career, changed, course, between, 1914, and, 1916, during, a, period, when, the, romanian, kingdom, kept, out, of, world, war, i, in, autumn, 1915, as, founder, and, editor, of, the, short, lived, journal, chemarea, vinea, published, two, poems, by, his, friend, the, first, printed, works, to, bear, the, signature, tristan, tzara, at, the, time, the, young, poet, and, many, of, his, friends, were, adherents, of, an, anti, war, and, anti, nationalist, current, which, progressively, accommodated, anti, establishment, messages, chemarea, which, was, a, platform, for, this, agenda, and, again, attracted, collaborations, from, chapier, may, also, have, been, financed, by, tzara, and, vinea, according, to, romanian, avant, garde, writer, claude, sernet, the, journal, was, totally, different, from, everything, that, had, been, printed, in, romania, before, that, moment, during, the, period, tzara, s, works, were, sporadically, published, in, hefter, hidalgo, s, versuri, i, proz, and, in, june, 1915, constantin, r, dulescu, motru, s, noua, revist, rom, n, published, samyro, s, known, poem, veri, oar, fat, de, pension, little, cousin, boarding, school, girl, tzara, had, enrolled, at, the, university, of, bucharest, in, 1914, studying, mathematics, and, philosophy, but, did, not, graduate, in, autumn, 1915, he, left, romania, for, z, rich, in, neutral, switzerland, janco, together, with, his, brother, jules, janco, had, settled, there, a, few, months, before, and, was, later, joined, by, his, other, brother, georges, janco, tzara, who, may, have, applied, to, the, faculty, of, philosophy, at, the, local, university, shared, lodging, with, marcel, janco, who, was, a, student, at, the, technische, hochschule, in, the, altinger, guest, house, by, 1918, tzara, had, moved, to, the, limmatquai, hotel, his, departure, from, romania, like, that, of, the, janco, brothers, may, have, been, in, part, a, pacifist, political, statement, after, settling, in, switzerland, the, young, poet, almost, completely, discarded, romanian, as, his, language, of, expression, writing, most, of, his, subsequent, works, in, french, the, poems, he, had, written, before, which, were, the, result, of, poetic, dialogues, between, him, and, his, friend, were, left, in, vinea, s, care, most, of, these, pieces, were, first, printed, only, in, the, interwar, period, it, was, in, z, rich, that, the, romanian, group, met, with, the, german, hugo, ball, an, anarchist, poet, and, pianist, and, his, young, wife, emmy, hennings, a, music, hall, performer, in, february, 1916, ball, had, rented, the, cabaret, voltaire, from, its, owner, jan, ephraim, and, intended, to, use, the, venue, for, performance, art, and, exhibits, hugo, ball, recorded, this, period, noting, that, tzara, and, marcel, janco, like, hans, arp, arthur, segal, otto, van, rees, and, max, oppenheimer, readily, agreed, to, take, part, in, the, cabaret, according, to, ball, among, the, performances, of, songs, mimicking, or, taking, inspiration, from, various, national, folklores, herr, tristan, tzara, recited, rumanian, poetry, in, late, march, ball, recounted, the, group, was, joined, by, german, writer, and, drummer, richard, huelsenbeck, he, was, soon, after, involved, in, tzara, s, simultaneist, verse, performance, the, first, in, z, rich, and, in, the, world, also, including, renditions, of, poems, by, two, promoters, of, cubism, fernand, divoire, and, henri, barzun, it, was, in, this, milieu, that, dada, was, born, at, some, point, before, may, 1916, when, a, publication, of, the, same, name, first, saw, print, the, story, of, its, establishment, was, the, subject, of, a, disagreement, between, tzara, and, his, fellow, writers, cernat, believes, that, the, first, dadaist, performance, took, place, as, early, as, february, when, the, nineteen, year, old, tzara, wearing, a, monocle, entered, the, cabaret, voltaire, stage, singing, sentimental, melodies, and, handing, paper, wads, to, his, scandalized, spectators, leaving, the, stage, to, allow, room, for, masked, actors, on, stilts, and, returning, in, clown, attire, the, same, type, of, performances, took, place, at, the, zunfthaus, zur, waag, beginning, in, summer, 1916, after, the, cabaret, voltaire, was, forced, to, close, down, according, to, music, historian, bernard, gendron, for, as, long, as, it, lasted, the, cabaret, voltaire, was, dada, there, was, no, alternative, institution, or, site, that, could, disentangle, pure, dada, from, its, mere, accompaniment, nor, was, any, such, site, desired, other, opinions, link, dada, s, beginnings, with, much, earlier, events, including, the, experiments, of, alfred, jarry, andr, gide, christian, morgenstern, jean, pierre, brisset, guillaume, apollinaire, jacques, vach, marcel, duchamp, and, francis, picabia, in, the, first, of, the, movement, s, manifestos, ball, wrote, is, intended, to, present, to, the, public, the, activities, and, interests, of, the, cabaret, voltaire, which, has, as, its, sole, purpose, to, draw, attention, across, the, barriers, of, war, and, nationalism, to, the, few, independent, spirits, who, live, for, other, ideals, the, next, objective, of, the, artists, who, are, assembled, here, is, to, publish, a, revue, internationale, ball, completed, his, message, in, french, and, the, paragraph, translates, as, the, magazine, shall, be, published, in, z, rich, and, shall, carry, the, name, dada, dada, dada, dada, dada, dada, the, view, according, to, which, ball, had, created, the, movement, was, notably, supported, by, writer, walter, serner, who, directly, accused, tzara, of, having, abused, ball, s, initiative, a, secondary, point, of, contention, between, the, founders, of, dada, regarded, the, paternity, for, the, movement, s, name, which, according, to, visual, artist, and, essayist, hans, richter, was, first, adopted, in, print, in, june, 1916, ball, who, claimed, authorship, and, stated, that, he, picked, the, word, randomly, from, a, dictionary, indicated, that, it, stood, for, both, the, french, language, equivalent, of, hobby, horse, and, a, german, language, term, reflecting, the, joy, of, children, being, rocked, to, sleep, tzara, himself, declined, interest, in, the, matter, but, marcel, janco, credited, him, with, having, coined, the, term, dada, manifestos, written, or, co, authored, by, tzara, record, that, the, name, shares, its, form, with, various, other, terms, including, a, word, used, in, the, kru, languages, of, west, africa, to, designate, the, tail, of, a, sacred, cow, a, toy, and, the, name, for, mother, in, an, unspecified, italian, dialect, and, the, double, affirmative, in, romanian, and, in, various, slavic, languages, before, the, end, of, the, war, tzara, had, assumed, a, position, as, dada, s, main, promoter, and, manager, helping, the, swiss, group, establish, branches, in, other, european, countries, this, period, also, saw, the, first, conflict, within, the, group, citing, irreconcilable, differences, with, tzara, ball, left, the, group, with, his, departure, gendron, argues, tzara, was, able, to, move, dada, vaudeville, like, performances, into, more, of, an, incendiary, and, yet, jocularly, provocative, theater, he, is, often, credited, with, having, inspired, many, young, modernist, authors, from, outside, switzerland, to, affiliate, with, the, group, in, particular, the, frenchmen, louis, aragon, andr, breton, paul, luard, georges, ribemont, dessaignes, and, philippe, soupault, richter, who, also, came, into, contact, with, dada, at, this, stage, in, its, history, notes, that, these, intellectuals, often, had, a, very, cool, and, distant, attitude, to, this, new, movement, before, being, approached, by, the, romanian, author, in, june, 1916, he, began, editing, and, managing, the, periodical, dada, as, a, successor, of, the, short, lived, magazine, cabaret, voltaire, richter, describes, his, energy, passion, and, talent, for, the, job, which, he, claims, satisfied, all, dadaists, he, was, at, the, time, the, lover, of, maja, kruscek, who, was, a, student, of, rudolf, laban, in, richter, s, account, their, relationship, was, always, tottering, as, early, as, 1916, tristan, tzara, took, distance, from, the, italian, futurists, rejecting, the, militarist, and, proto, fascist, stance, of, their, leader, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, richter, notes, that, by, then, dada, had, replaced, futurism, as, the, leader, of, modernism, while, continuing, to, build, on, its, influence, we, had, swallowed, futurism, bones, feathers, and, all, it, is, true, that, in, the, process, of, digestion, all, sorts, of, bones, and, feathers, had, been, regurgitated, despite, this, and, the, fact, that, dada, did, not, make, any, gains, in, italy, tzara, could, count, poets, giuseppe, ungaretti, and, alberto, savinio, painters, gino, cantarelli, and, aldo, fiozzi, as, well, as, a, few, other, italian, futurists, among, the, dadaists, among, the, italian, authors, supporting, dadaist, manifestos, and, rallying, with, the, dada, group, was, the, poet, painter, and, in, the, future, a, fascist, racial, theorist, julius, evola, who, became, a, personal, friend, of, tzara, the, next, year, tzara, and, ball, opened, the, galerie, dada, permanent, exhibit, through, which, they, set, contacts, with, the, independent, italian, visual, artist, giorgio, de, chirico, and, with, the, german, expressionist, journal, der, sturm, all, of, whom, were, described, as, fathers, of, dada, during, the, same, months, and, probably, owing, to, tzara, s, intervention, the, dada, group, organized, a, performance, of, sphinx, and, strawman, a, puppet, play, by, the, austro, hungarian, expressionist, oskar, kokoschka, whom, he, advertised, as, an, example, of, dada, theater, he, was, also, in, touch, with, nord, sud, the, magazine, of, french, poet, pierre, reverdy, who, sought, to, unify, all, avant, garde, trends, and, contributed, articles, on, african, art, to, both, nord, sud, and, pierre, albert, birot, s, sic, magazine, in, early, 1918, through, huelsenbeck, z, rich, dadaists, established, contacts, with, their, more, explicitly, left, wing, disciples, in, the, german, empire, george, grosz, john, heartfield, johannes, baader, kurt, schwitters, walter, mehring, raoul, hausmann, carl, einstein, franz, jung, and, heartfield, s, brother, wieland, herzfelde, with, breton, soupault, and, aragon, tzara, traveled, cologne, where, he, became, familiarized, with, the, elaborate, collage, works, of, schwitters, and, max, ernst, which, he, showed, to, his, colleagues, in, switzerland, huelsenbeck, nonetheless, declined, to, schwitters, membership, in, berlin, dada, as, a, result, of, his, campaigning, tzara, created, a, list, of, so, called, dada, presidents, who, represented, various, regions, of, europe, according, to, hans, richter, it, included, alongside, tzara, figures, ranging, from, ernst, arp, baader, breton, and, aragon, to, kruscek, evola, rafael, lasso, de, la, vega, igor, stravinsky, vicente, huidobro, francesco, meriano, and, th, odore, fraenkel, richter, notes, i, m, not, sure, if, all, the, names, who, appear, here, would, agree, with, the, description, the, shows, tzara, staged, in, z, rich, often, turned, into, scandals, or, riots, and, he, was, in, permanent, conflict, with, the, swiss, law, enforcers, hans, richter, speaks, of, a, pleasure, of, letting, fly, at, the, bourgeois, which, in, tristan, tzara, took, the, form, of, coldly, or, hotly, calculated, insolence, see, pater, la, bourgeoisie, in, one, instance, as, part, of, a, series, of, events, in, which, dadaists, mocked, established, authors, tzara, and, arp, falsely, publicized, that, they, were, going, to, fight, a, duel, in, rehalp, near, z, rich, and, that, they, were, going, to, have, the, popular, novelist, jakob, christoph, heer, for, their, witness, richter, also, reports, that, his, romanian, colleague, profited, from, swiss, neutrality, to, play, the, allies, and, central, powers, against, each, other, obtaining, art, works, and, funds, from, both, making, use, of, their, need, to, stimulate, their, respective, propaganda, efforts, while, active, as, a, promoter, tzara, also, published, his, first, volume, of, collected, poetry, the, 1918, vingt, cinq, po, mes, twenty, five, poems, a, major, event, took, place, in, autumn, 1918, when, francis, picabia, who, was, then, publisher, of, 391, magazine, and, a, distant, dada, affiliate, visited, z, rich, and, introduced, his, colleagues, there, to, his, nihilistic, views, on, art, and, reason, in, the, united, states, picabia, man, ray, and, marcel, duchamp, had, earlier, set, up, their, own, version, of, dada, this, circle, based, in, new, york, city, sought, affiliation, with, tzara, s, only, in, 1921, when, they, jokingly, asked, him, to, grant, them, permission, to, use, dada, as, their, own, name, to, which, tzara, replied, dada, belongs, to, everybody, the, visit, was, credited, by, richter, with, boosting, the, romanian, author, s, status, but, also, with, making, tzara, himself, switch, suddenly, from, a, position, of, balance, between, art, and, anti, art, into, the, stratospheric, regions, of, pure, and, joyful, nothingness, the, movement, subsequently, organized, its, last, major, swiss, show, held, at, the, saal, zur, kaufleutern, with, choreography, by, susanne, perrottet, sophie, taeuber, arp, and, with, the, participation, of, k, the, wulff, hans, heusser, tzara, hans, richter, and, walter, serner, it, was, there, that, serner, read, from, his, 1918, essay, whose, very, title, advocated, letzte, lockerung, final, dissolution, this, part, is, believed, to, have, caused, the, subsequent, m, l, e, during, which, the, public, attacked, the, performers, and, succeeded, in, interrupting, but, not, canceling, the, show, following, the, november, 1918, armistice, with, germany, dada, s, evolution, was, marked, by, political, developments, in, october, 1919, tzara, arp, and, otto, flake, began, publishing, der, zeltweg, a, journal, aimed, at, further, popularizing, dada, in, a, post, war, world, were, the, borders, were, again, accessible, richter, who, admits, that, the, magazine, was, rather, tame, also, notes, that, tzara, and, his, colleagues, were, dealing, with, the, impact, of, communist, revolutions, in, particular, the, october, revolution, and, the, german, revolts, of, 1918, which, had, stirred, men, s, minds, divided, men, s, interests, and, diverted, energies, in, the, direction, of, political, change, the, same, commentator, however, dismisses, those, accounts, which, he, believes, led, readers, to, believe, that, der, zeltweg, was, an, association, of, revolutionary, artists, according, to, one, account, rendered, by, historian, robert, levy, tzara, shared, company, with, a, group, of, romanian, communist, students, and, as, such, may, have, met, with, ana, pauker, who, was, later, one, of, the, romanian, communist, party, s, most, prominent, activists, arp, and, janco, drifted, away, from, the, movement, ca, 1919, when, they, created, the, constructivist, inspired, workshop, das, neue, leben, in, romania, dada, was, awarded, an, ambiguous, reception, from, tzara, s, former, associate, vinea, although, he, was, sympathetic, to, its, goals, treasured, hugo, ball, and, hennings, and, promised, to, adapt, his, own, writings, to, its, requirements, vinea, cautioned, tzara, and, the, jancos, in, favor, of, lucidity, when, vinea, submitted, his, poem, dolean, e, grievances, to, be, published, by, tzara, and, his, associates, he, was, turned, down, an, incident, which, critics, attribute, to, a, contrast, between, the, reserved, tone, of, the, piece, and, the, revolutionary, tenets, of, dada, in, late, 1919, tristan, tzara, left, switzerland, to, join, breton, soupault, and, claude, rivi, re, in, editing, the, paris, based, magazine, litt, rature, already, a, mentor, for, the, french, avant, garde, he, was, according, to, hans, richter, perceived, as, an, anti, messiah, and, a, prophet, reportedly, dada, mythology, had, it, that, he, entered, the, french, capital, in, a, snow, white, or, lilac, colored, car, passing, down, boulevard, raspail, through, a, triumphal, arch, made, from, his, own, pamphlets, being, greeted, by, cheering, crowds, and, a, fireworks, display, richter, dismisses, this, account, indicating, that, tzara, actually, walked, from, gare, de, l, est, to, picabia, s, home, without, anyone, expecting, him, to, arrive, he, is, often, described, as, the, main, figure, in, the, litt, rature, circle, and, credited, with, having, more, firmly, set, its, artistic, principles, in, the, line, of, dada, when, picabia, began, publishing, a, new, series, of, 391, in, paris, tzara, seconded, him, and, richter, says, produced, issues, of, the, magazine, decked, out, in, all, the, colors, of, dada, he, was, also, issuing, his, dada, magazine, printed, in, paris, but, using, the, same, format, renaming, it, bulletin, dada, and, later, dadaphone, at, around, that, time, he, met, american, author, gertrude, stein, who, wrote, about, him, in, the, autobiography, of, alice, b, toklas, and, the, artist, couple, robert, and, sonia, delaunay, with, whom, he, worked, in, tandem, for, poem, dresses, and, other, simultaneist, literary, pieces, tzara, became, involved, in, a, number, of, dada, experiments, on, which, he, collaborated, with, breton, aragon, soupault, picabia, or, paul, luard, other, authors, who, came, into, contact, with, dada, at, that, stage, were, jean, cocteau, paul, derm, e, and, raymond, radiguet, the, performances, staged, by, dada, were, often, meant, to, popularize, its, principles, and, dada, continued, to, draw, attention, on, itself, by, hoaxes, and, false, advertising, announcing, that, the, hollywood, film, star, charlie, chaplin, was, going, to, appear, on, stage, at, its, show, or, that, its, members, were, going, to, have, their, heads, shaved, or, their, hair, cut, off, on, stage, in, another, instance, tzara, and, his, associates, lectured, at, the, universit, populaire, in, front, of, industrial, workers, who, were, reportedly, less, than, impressed, richter, believes, that, ideologically, tzara, was, still, in, tribute, to, picabia, s, nihilistic, and, anarchic, views, which, made, the, dadaists, attack, all, political, and, cultural, ideologies, but, that, this, also, implied, a, measure, of, sympathy, for, the, working, class, dada, activities, in, paris, culminated, in, the, march, 1920, variety, show, at, the, th, tre, de, l, uvre, which, featured, readings, from, breton, picabia, derm, e, and, tzara, s, earlier, work, la, premi, re, aventure, c, leste, de, m, antipyrine, the, first, heavenly, adventure, of, mr, antipyrine, tzara, s, melody, vaseline, symphonique, symphonic, vaseline, which, required, ten, or, twenty, people, to, shout, cra, and, cri, on, a, rising, scale, was, also, performed, a, scandal, erupted, when, breton, read, picabia, s, manifeste, cannibale, cannibal, manifesto, lashing, out, at, the, audience, and, mocking, them, to, which, they, answered, by, aiming, rotten, fruit, at, the, stage, the, dada, phenomenon, was, only, noticed, in, romania, beginning, in, 1920, and, its, overall, reception, was, negative, traditionalist, historian, nicolae, iorga, symbolist, promoter, ovid, densusianu, the, more, reserved, modernists, camil, petrescu, and, benjamin, fondane, all, refused, to, accept, it, as, a, valid, artistic, manifestation, although, he, rallied, with, tradition, vinea, defended, the, subversive, current, in, front, of, more, serious, criticism, and, rejected, the, widespread, rumor, that, tzara, had, acted, as, an, agent, of, influence, for, the, central, powers, during, the, war, eugen, lovinescu, editor, of, sbur, torul, and, one, of, vinea, s, rivals, on, the, modernist, scene, acknowledged, the, influence, exercised, by, tzara, on, the, younger, avant, garde, authors, but, analyzed, his, work, only, briefly, using, as, an, example, one, of, his, pre, dada, poems, and, depicting, him, as, an, advocate, of, literary, extremism, by, 1921, tzara, had, become, involved, in, conflicts, with, other, figures, in, the, movement, whom, he, claimed, had, parted, with, the, spirit, of, dada, he, was, targeted, by, the, berlin, based, dadaists, in, particular, by, huelsenbeck, and, serner, the, former, of, whom, was, also, involved, in, a, conflict, with, raoul, hausmann, over, leadership, status, according, to, richter, tensions, between, breton, and, tzara, had, surfaced, in, 1920, when, breton, first, made, known, his, wish, to, do, away, with, musical, performances, altogether, and, alleged, that, the, romanian, was, merely, repeating, himself, the, dada, shows, themselves, were, by, then, such, common, occurrences, that, audiences, expected, to, be, insulted, by, the, performers, a, more, serious, crisis, occurred, in, may, when, dada, organized, a, mock, trial, of, maurice, barr, s, whose, early, affiliation, with, the, symbolists, had, been, shadowed, by, his, antisemitism, and, reactionary, stance, georges, ribemont, dessaignes, was, the, prosecutor, aragon, and, soupault, the, defense, attorneys, with, tzara, ungaretti, benjamin, p, ret, and, others, as, witnesses, a, mannequin, stood, in, for, barr, s, p, ret, immediately, upset, picabia, and, tzara, by, refusing, to, make, the, trial, an, absurd, one, and, by, introducing, a, political, subtext, with, which, breton, nevertheless, agreed, in, june, tzara, and, picabia, clashed, with, each, other, after, tzara, expressed, an, opinion, that, his, former, mentor, was, becoming, too, radical, during, the, same, season, breton, arp, ernst, maja, kruschek, and, tzara, were, in, austria, at, imst, where, they, published, their, last, manifesto, as, a, group, dada, au, grand, air, dada, in, the, open, air, or, der, s, ngerkrieg, in, tirol, the, battle, of, the, singers, in, tyrol, tzara, also, visited, czechoslovakia, where, he, reportedly, hoped, to, gain, adherents, to, his, cause, also, in, 1921, ion, vinea, wrote, an, article, for, the, romanian, newspaper, adev, rul, arguing, that, the, movement, had, exhausted, itself, although, in, his, letters, to, tzara, he, continued, to, ask, his, friend, to, return, home, and, spread, his, message, there, after, july, 1922, marcel, janco, rallied, with, vinea, in, editing, contimporanul, which, published, some, of, tzara, s, earliest, poems, but, never, offered, space, to, any, dadaist, manifesto, reportedly, the, conflict, between, tzara, and, janco, had, a, personal, note, janco, later, mentioned, some, dramatic, quarrels, between, his, colleague, and, him, they, avoided, each, other, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, and, tzara, even, struck, out, the, dedications, to, janco, from, his, early, poems, julius, evola, also, grew, disappointed, by, the, movement, s, total, rejection, of, tradition, and, began, his, personal, search, for, an, alternative, pursuing, a, path, which, later, led, him, to, esotericism, and, fascism, tzara, was, openly, attacked, by, breton, in, a, february, 1922, article, for, le, journal, de, peuple, where, the, romanian, writer, was, denounced, as, an, impostor, avid, for, publicity, in, march, breton, initiated, the, congress, for, the, determination, and, defense, of, the, modern, spirit, the, french, writer, used, the, occasion, to, strike, out, tzara, s, name, from, among, the, dadaists, citing, in, his, support, dada, s, huelsenbeck, serner, and, christian, schad, basing, his, statement, on, a, note, supposedly, authored, by, huelsenbeck, breton, also, accused, tzara, of, opportunism, claiming, that, he, had, planned, wartime, editions, of, dada, works, in, such, a, manner, as, not, to, upset, actors, on, the, political, stage, making, sure, that, german, dadaists, were, not, made, available, to, the, public, in, countries, subject, to, the, supreme, war, council, tzara, who, attended, the, congress, only, as, a, means, to, subvert, it, responded, to, the, accusations, the, same, month, arguing, that, huelsenbeck, s, note, was, fabricated, and, that, schad, had, not, been, one, of, the, original, dadaists, rumors, reported, much, later, by, american, writer, brion, gysin, had, it, that, breton, s, claims, also, depicted, tzara, as, an, informer, for, the, prefecture, of, police, in, may, 1922, dada, staged, its, own, funeral, according, to, hans, richter, the, main, part, of, this, took, place, in, weimar, where, the, dadaists, attended, a, festival, of, the, bauhaus, art, school, during, which, tzara, proclaimed, the, elusive, nature, of, his, art, dada, is, useless, like, everything, else, in, life, dada, is, a, virgin, microbe, which, penetrates, with, the, insistence, of, air, into, all, those, spaces, that, reason, has, failed, to, fill, with, words, and, conventions, in, the, bearded, heart, manifesto, a, number, of, artists, backed, the, marginalization, of, breton, in, support, of, tzara, alongside, cocteau, arp, ribemont, dessaignes, and, luard,

performed, two, years, earlier, to, howls, of, derision, from, its, audience, for, which, sonia, delaunay, designed, the, costumes, breton, interrupted, its, performance, and, reportedly, fought, with, several, of, his, former, associates, and, broke, furniture, prompting, a, theatre, riot, that, only, the, intervention, of, the, police, halted, dada, s, vaudeville, declined, in, importance, and, disappeared, altogether, after, that, date, picabia, took, breton, s, side, against, tzara, and, replaced, the, staff, of, his, 391, enlisting, collaborations, from, cl, ment, pansaers, and, ezra, pound, breton, marked, the, end, of, dada, in, 1924, when, he, issued, the, first, surrealist, manifesto, richter, suggests, that, surrealism, devoured, and, digested, dada, tzara, distanced, himself, from, the, new, trend, disagreeing, with, its, methods, and, increasingly, with, its, politics, in, 1923, he, and, a, few, other, former, dadaists, collaborated, with, richter, and, the,

tzara, s, apparent, dissidence, and, the, crisis, he, helped, provoke, within, the, communist, party, were, celebrated, by, breton, who, had, adopted, a, pro, hungarian, stance, and, who, defined, his, friend, and, rival, as, the, first, spokesman, of, the, hungarian, demand, he, was, thereafter, mostly, withdrawn, from, public, life, dedicating, himself, to, researching, the, work, of, 15th, century, poet, fran, ois, villon, and, like, his, fellow, surrealist, michel, leiris, to, promoting, primitive, and, african, art, which, he, had, been, collecting, for, years, in, early, 1957, tzara, attended, a, dada, retrospective, on, the, rive, gauche, which, ended, in, a, riot, caused, by, the, rival, avant, garde, mouvement, jariviste, an, outcome, which, reportedly, pleased, him, in, august, 1960, one, year, after, the, fifth, republic, had, been, established, by, president, charles, de, gaulle, french, forces, were, confronting, the, algerian, rebels, see, algerian, war, together, with, simone, de, beauvoir, marguerite, duras, j, r, me, lindon, alain, robbe, grillet, and, other, intellectuals, he, addressed, premier, michel, debr, a, letter, of, protest, concerning, france, s, refusal, to, grant, algeria, its, independence, as, a, result, minister, of, culture, andr, malraux, announced, that, his, cabinet, would, not, subsidize, any, films, to, which, tzara, and, the, others, might, contribute, and, the, signatories, could, no, longer, appear, on, stations, managed, by, the, state, owned, french, broadcasting, service, in, 1961, as, recognition, for, his, work, as, a, poet, tzara, was, awarded, the, prestigious, taormina, prize, one, of, his, final, public, activities, took, place, in, 1962, when, he, attended, the, international, congress, on, african, culture, organized, by, english, curator, frank, mcewen, and, held, at, the, national, gallery, in, salisbury, southern, rhodesia, he, died, one, year, later, in, his, paris, home, and, was, buried, at, the, cimeti, re, du, montparnasse, much, critical, commentary, about, tzara, surrounds, the, measure, to, which, the, poet, identified, with, the, national, cultures, which, he, represented, paul, cernat, notes, that, the, association, between, samyro, and, the, jancos, who, were, jews, and, their, ethnic, romanian, colleagues, was, one, sign, of, a, cultural, dialogue, in, which, the, openness, of, romanian, environments, toward, artistic, modernity, was, stimulated, by, young, emancipated, jewish, writers, salomon, schulman, a, swedish, researcher, of, yiddish, literature, argues, that, the, combined, influence, of, yiddish, folklore, and, hasidic, philosophy, shaped, european, modernism, in, general, and, tzara, s, style, in, particular, while, american, poet, andrei, codrescu, speaks, of, tzara, as, one, in, a, balkan, line, of, absurdist, writing, which, also, includes, the, romanians, urmuz, eug, ne, ionesco, and, emil, cioran, according, to, literary, historian, george, c, linescu, samyro, s, early, poems, deal, with, the, voluptuousness, over, the, strong, scents, of, rural, life, which, is, typical, among, jews, compressed, into, ghettos, tzara, himself, used, elements, alluding, to, his, homeland, in, his, early, dadaist, performances, his, collaboration, with, maja, kruscek, at, zuntfhaus, z, r, waag, featured, samples, of, african, literature, to, which, tzara, added, romanian, language, fragments, he, is, also, known, to, have, mixed, elements, of, romanian, folklore, and, to, have, sung, the, native, suburban, romanza, la, moar, la, h, r, a, at, the, mill, in, h, r, a, during, at, least, one, staging, for, cabaret, voltaire, addressing, the, romanian, public, in, 1947, he, claimed, to, have, been, captivated, by, the, sweet, language, of, moldavian, peasants, tzara, nonetheless, rebelled, against, his, birthplace, and, upbringing, his, earliest, poems, depict, provincial, moldavia, as, a, desolate, and, unsettling, place, in, cernat, s, view, this, imagery, was, in, common, use, among, moldavian, born, writers, who, also, belonged, to, the, avant, garde, trend, notably, benjamin, fondane, and, george, bacovia, like, in, the, cases, of, eug, ne, ionesco, and, fondane, cernat, proposes, samyro, sought, self, exile, to, western, europe, as, a, modern, voluntarist, means, of, breaking, with, the, peripheral, condition, which, may, also, serve, to, explain, the, pun, he, selected, for, a, pseudonym, according, to, the, same, author, two, important, elements, in, this, process, were, a, maternal, attachment, and, a, break, with, paternal, authority, an, oedipus, complex, which, he, also, argued, was, evident, in, the, biographies, of, other, symbolist, and, avant, garde, romanian, authors, from, urmuz, to, mateiu, caragiale, unlike, vinea, and, the, contimporanul, group, cernat, proposes, tzara, stood, for, radicalism, and, insurgency, which, would, also, help, explain, their, impossibility, to, communicate, in, particular, cernat, argues, the, writer, sought, to, emancipate, himself, from, competing, nationalisms, and, addressed, himself, directly, to, the, center, of, european, culture, with, z, rich, serving, as, a, stage, on, his, way, to, paris, the, 1916, monsieur, s, antipyrine, s, manifesto, featured, a, cosmopolitan, appeal, dada, remains, within, the, framework, of, european, weaknesses, it, s, still, shit, but, from, now, on, we, want, to, shit, in, different, colors, so, as, to, adorn, the, zoo, of, art, with, all, the, flags, of, all, the, consulates, with, time, tristan, tzara, came, to, be, regarded, by, his, dada, associates, as, an, exotic, character, whose, attitudes, were, intrinsically, linked, with, eastern, europe, early, on, ball, referred, to, him, and, the, janco, brothers, as, orientals, hans, richter, believed, him, to, be, a, fiery, and, impulsive, figure, having, little, in, common, with, his, german, collaborators, according, to, cernat, richter, s, perspective, seems, to, indicate, a, vision, of, tzara, having, a, latin, temperament, this, type, of, perception, also, had, negative, implications, for, tzara, particularly, after, the, 1922, split, within, dada, in, the, 1940s, richard, huelsenbeck, alleged, that, his, former, colleague, had, always, been, separated, from, other, dadaists, by, his, failure, to, appreciate, the, legacy, of, german, humanism, and, that, compared, to, his, german, colleagues, he, was, a, barbarian, in, his, polemic, with, tzara, breton, also, repeatedly, placed, stress, on, his, rival, s, foreign, origin, at, home, tzara, was, occasionally, targeted, for, his, jewishness, culminating, in, the, ban, enforced, by, the, ion, antonescu, regime, in, 1931, const, i, emilian, the, first, romanian, to, write, an, academic, study, on, the, avant, garde, attacked, him, from, a, conservative, and, antisemitic, position, he, depicted, dadaists, as, judaeo, bolsheviks, who, corrupted, romanian, culture, and, included, tzara, among, the, main, proponents, of, literary, anarchism, alleging, that, tzara, s, only, merit, was, to, establish, a, literary, fashion, while, recognizing, his, formal, virtuosity, and, artistic, intelligence, he, claimed, to, prefer, tzara, in, his, simbolul, stage, this, perspective, was, deplored, early, on, by, the, modernist, critic, perpessicius, nine, years, after, emilian, s, polemic, text, fascist, poet, and, journalist, radu, gyr, published, an, article, in, convorbiri, literare, in, which, he, attacked, tzara, as, a, representative, of, the, judaic, spirit, of, the, foreign, plague, and, of, materialist, historical, dialectics, tzara, s, earliest, symbolist, poems, published, in, simbolul, during, 1912, were, later, rejected, by, their, author, who, asked, sa, a, pan, not, to, include, them, in, editions, of, his, works, the, influence, of, french, symbolists, on, the, young, samyro, was, particularly, important, and, surfaced, in, both, his, lyric, and, prose, poems, attached, to, symbolist, musicality, at, that, stage, he, was, indebted, to, his, simbolul, colleague, ion, minulescu, and, the, belgian, maurice, maeterlinck, philip, beitchman, argues, that, tristan, tzara, is, one, of, the, writers, of, the, twentieth, century, who, was, most, profoundly, influenced, by, symbolism, and, utilized, many, of, its, methods, and, ideas, in, the, pursuit, of, his, own, artistic, and, social, ends, however, cernat, believes, the, young, poet, was, by, then, already, breaking, with, the, syntax, of, conventional, poetry, and, that, in, subsequent, experimental, pieces, he, progressively, stripped, his, style, of, its, symbolist, elements, during, the, 1910s, samyro, experimented, with, symbolist, imagery, in, particular, with, the, hanged, man, motif, which, served, as, the, basis, for, his, poem, se, sp, nzur, un, om, a, man, hangs, himself, and, which, built, on, the, legacy, of, similar, pieces, authored, by, christian, morgenstern, and, jules, laforgue, se, sp, nzur, un, om, was, also, in, many, ways, similar, to, ones, authored, by, his, collaborators, adrian, maniu, balada, sp, nzuratului, the, hanged, man, s, ballad, and, vinea, visul, sp, nzuratului, the, hanged, man, s, dream, all, three, poets, who, were, all, in, the, process, of, discarding, symbolism, interpreted, the, theme, from, a, tragicomic, and, iconoclastic, perspective, these, pieces, also, include, vacan, n, provincie, provincial, holiday, and, the, anti, war, fragment, furtuna, i, c, ntecul, dezertorului, the, storm, and, the, deserter, s, song, which, vinea, published, in, his, chemarea, the, series, is, seen, by, cernat, as, the, general, rehearsal, for, the, dada, adventure, the, complete, text, of, furtuna, i, c, ntecul, dezertorului, was, published, at, a, later, stage, after, the, missing, text, was, discovered, by, pan, at, the, time, he, became, interested, in, the, free, verse, work, of, the, american, walt, whitman, and, his, translation, of, whitman, s, epic, poem, song, of, myself, probably, completed, before, world, war, i, was, published, by, alfred, hefter, hidalgo, in, his, magazine, versuri, i, proz, 1915, beitchman, notes, that, throughout, his, life, tzara, used, symbolist, elements, against, the, doctrines, of, symbolism, thus, he, argues, the, poet, did, not, cultivate, a, memory, of, historical, events, since, it, deludes, man, into, thinking, that, there, was, something, when, there, was, nothing, cernat, notes, that, which, essentially, unifies, during, the, poetic, output, of, adrian, maniu, ion, vinea, and, tristan, tzara, is, an, acute, awareness, of, literary, conventions, a, satiety, in, respect, to, calophile, literature, which, they, perceived, as, exhausted, in, beitchman, s, view, the, revolt, against, cultivated, beauty, was, a, constant, in, tzara, s, years, of, maturity, and, his, visions, of, social, change, continued, to, be, inspired, by, arthur, rimbaud, and, the, comte, de, lautr, amont, according, to, beitchman, tzara, uses, the, symbolist, message, the, birthright, has, been, sold, for, a, mess, of, porridge, taking, it, into, the, streets, cabarets, and, trains, where, he, denounces, the, deal, and, asks, for, his, birthright, back, the, transition, to, a, more, radical, form, of, poetry, seems, to, have, taken, place, in, 1913, 1915, during, the, periods, when, tzara, and, vinea, were, vacationing, together, the, pieces, share, a, number, of, characteristics, and, subjects, and, the, two, poets, even, use, them, to, allude, to, one, another, or, in, one, case, to, tzara, s, sister, in, addition, to, the, lyrics, were, they, both, speak, of, provincial, holidays, and, love, affairs, with, local, girls, both, friends, intended, to, reinterpret, william, shakespeare, s, hamlet, from, a, modernist, perspective, and, wrote, incomplete, texts, with, this, as, their, subject, however, paul, cernat, notes, the, texts, also, evidence, a, difference, in, approach, with, vinea, s, work, being, meditative, and, melancholic, while, tzara, s, is, hedonistic, tzara, often, appealed, to, revolutionary, and, ironic, images, portraying, provincial, and, middle, class, environments, as, places, of, artificiality, and, decay, demystifying,

his, previous, rejection, of, dada, contimporanul, collaborator, benjamin, fondane, used, them, as, an, example, of, pure, poetry, and, compared, them, to, the, elaborate, writings, of, french, poet, paul, val, ry, thus, recuperating, them, in, line, with, the, magazine, s, ideology, tzara, the, dadaist, was, inspired, by, the, contributions, of, his, experimental, modernist, predecessors, among, them, were, the, literary, promoters, of, cubism, in, addition, to, henri, barzun, and, fernand, divoire, tzara, cherished, the, works, of, guillaume, apollinaire, despite, dada, s, condemnation, of, futurism, various, authors, note, the, influence, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, and, his, circle, exercised, on, tzara, s, group, in, 1917, he, was, in, correspondence, with, both, apollinaire, and, marinetti, traditionally, tzara, is, also, seen, as, indebted, to, the, early, avant, garde, and, black, comedy, writings, of, romania, s, urmuz, for, a, large, part, dada, focused, on, performances, and, satire, with, shows, that, often, had, tzara, marcel, janco, and, huelsenbeck, for, their, main, protagonists, often, dressed, up, as, tyrolian, peasants, or, wearing, dark, robes, they, improvised, poetry, sessions, at, the, cabaret, voltaire, reciting, the, works, of, others, or, their, spontaneous, creations, which, were, or, pretended, to, be, in, esperanto, or, m, ori, language, bernard, gendron, describes, these, soir, es, as, marked, by, heterogeneity, and, eclecticism, and, richter, notes, that, the, songs, often, punctuated, by, loud, shrieks, or, other, unsettling, sounds, built, on, the, legacy, of, noise, music, and, futurist, compositions, with, time, tristan, tzara, merged, his, performances, and, his, literature, taking, part, in, developing, dada, s, simultaneist, poetry, which, was, meant, to, be, read, out, loud, and, involved, a, collaborative, effort, being, according, to, hans, arp, the, first, instance, of, surrealist, automatism, ball, stated, that, the, subject, of, such, pieces, was, the, value, of, the, human, voice, together, with, arp, tzara, and, walter, serner, produced, the, german, language, die, hyperbel, vom, krokodilcoiffeur, und, dem, spazierstock, the, hyperbole, of, the, crocodile, s, hairdresser, and, the, walking, stick, in, which, arp, stated, the, poet, crows, curses, sighs, stutters, yodels, as, he, pleases, his, poems, are, like, nature, a, tiny, particle, is, as, beautiful, and, important, as, a, star, another, noted, simultaneist, poem, was, l, amiral, cherche, une, maison, louer, the, admiral, is, looking, for, a, house, to, rent, co, authored, by, tzara, marcel, janco, and, huelsenbach, art, historian, roger, cardinal, describes, tristan, tzara, s, dada, poetry, as, marked, by, extreme, semantic, and, syntactic, incoherence, tzara, who, recommended, destroying, just, as, it, is, created, had, devised, a, personal, system, for, writing, poetry, which, implied, a, seemingly, chaotic, reassembling, of, words, that, had, been, randomly, cut, out, of, newspapers, the, romanian, writer, also, spent, the, dada, period, issuing, a, long, series, of, manifestos, which, were, often, authored, as, prose, poetry, and, according, to, cardinal, were, characterized, by, rumbustious, tomfoolery, and, astringent, wit, which, reflected, the, language, of, a, sophisticated, savage, huelsenbeck, credited, tzara, with, having, discovered, in, them, the, format, for, compress, what, we, think, and, feel, and, according, to, hans, richter, the, genre, suited, tzara, perfectly, despite, its, production, of, seemingly, theoretical, works, richter, indicates, dada, lacked, any, form, of, program, and, tzara, tried, to, perpetuate, this, state, of, affairs, his, dada, manifesto, of, 1918, stated, dada, means, nothing, adding, thought, is, produced, in, the, mouth, tzara, indicated, i, am, against, systems, the, most, acceptable, system, is, on, principle, to, have, none, in, addition, tzara, who, once, stated, that, logic, is, always, false, probably, approved, of, serner, s, vision, of, a, final, dissolution, according, to, philip, beitchman, a, core, concept, in, tzara, s, thought, was, that, as, long, as, we, do, things, the, way, we, think, we, once, did, them, we, will, be, unable, to, achieve, any, kind, of, livable, society, despite, adopting, such, anti, artistic, principles, richter, argues, tzara, like, many, of, his, fellow, dadaists, did, not, initially, discard, the, mission, of, furthening, the, cause, of, art, he, saw, this, evident, in, la, revue, dada, 2, a, poem, as, exquisite, as, freshly, picked, flowers, which, included, the, lyrics, cinq, n, gresses, dans, une, auto, ont, explos, suivant, les, 5, directions, de, mes, doigts, quand, je, pose, la, main, sur, la, poitrine, pour, prier, dieu, parfois, autour, de, ma, t, te, il, y, a, la, lumi, re, humide, des, vieux, oiseaux, lunaires, five, negro, women, in, a, car,

revue, dada, 2, which, also, includes, the, onomatopoeic, line, tralalalalalalalalalalala, is, one, example, where, tzara, applies, his, principles, of, chance, to, sounds, themselves, this, sort, of, arrangement, treasured, by, many, dadaists, was, probably, connected, with, apollinaire, s, calligrams, and, with, his, announcement, that, man, is, in, search, of, a, new, language, c, linescu, proposed, that, tzara, willingly, limited, the, impact, of, chance, taking, as, his, example, a, short, parody, piece, which, depicts, the, love, affair, between, cyclist, and, a, dadaist, which, ends, with, their, decapitation, by, a, jealous, husband, the, critic, notes, that, tzara, transparently, intended, to, shock, the, bourgeois, late, in, his, career, huelsenbeck, alleged, that, tzara, never, actually, applied, the, experimental, methods, he, had, devised, the, dada, series, makes, ample, use, of, contrast, ellipses, ridiculous, imagery, and, nonsensical, verdicts, tzara, was, aware, that, the, public, could, find, it, difficult, to, follow, his, intentions, and, in, a, piece, titled, le, g, ant, blanc, l, preux, du, paysage, the, white, leprous, giant, in, the, landscape, even, alluded, to, the, skinny, idiotic, dirty, reader, who, does, not, understand, my, poetry, he, called, some, of, his, own, poems, lampisteries, from, a, french, word, designating, storage, areas, for, light, fixtures, the, lettrist, poet, isidore, isou, included, such, pieces, in, a, succession, of, experiments, inaugurated, by, charles, baudelaire, with, the, destruction, of, the, anecdote, for, the, form, of, the, poem, a, process, which, with, tzara, became, destruction, of, the, word, for, nothing, according, to, american, literary, historian, mary, ann, caws, tzara, s, poems, may, be, seen, as, having, an, internal, order, and, read, as, a, simple, spectacle, as, creation, complete, in, itself, and, completely, obvious, tristan, tzara, s, first, play, the, gas, heart, dates, from, the, final, period, of, paris, dada, created, with, what, enoch, brater, calls, a, peculiar, verbal, strategy, it, is, a, dialogue, between, characters, called, ear, mouth, eye, nose, neck, and, eyebrow, they, seem, unwilling, to, actually, communicate, to, each, other, and, their, reliance, on, proverbs, and, idiotisms, willingly, creates, confusion, between, metaphorical, and, literal,

and, her, banker, husband, whose, character, traits, borrow, the, clich, s, of, conventional, drama, and, in, part, reproduces, settings, and, lines, from, hamlet, tzara, mocks, classical, theater, which, demands, from, characters, to, be, inspiring, believable, and, to, function, as, a, whole, handkerchief, of, clouds, requires, actors, in, the, role, of, commentators, to, address, each, other,

was, able, to, influence, successive, generations, of, writers, this, was, the, case, in, his, homeland, during, 1928, when, the, first, avant, garde, manifesto, issued, by, unu, magazine, written, by, sa, a, pan, and, moldov, cited, as, its, mentors, tzara, writers, breton, ribemont, dessaignes, vinea, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, and, tudor, arghezi, as, well, as, artists, constantin, br, ncu, i, and, theo, van, doesburg, one, of, the, romanian, writers, to, claim, inspiration, from, tzara, was, jacques, g, costin, who, nevertheless, offered, an, equally, good, reception, to, both, dadaism, and, futurism, while, ilarie, voronca, s, zodiac, cycle, first, published, in, france, is, traditionally, seen, as, indebted, to, the, approximate, man, the, kabbalist, and, surrealist, author,

by, tzara, in, g, rceni, ca, 1915, and, thus, sought, to, legitimize, his, own, modernist, vision, also, saw, urmuz, as, the, ignored, precursor, of, radical, modernism, from, dada, to, surrealism,

after, tzara, s, death, a, more, radical, questioning, of, tzara, s, influence, came, from, romanian, essayist, petre, pandrea, in, his, personal, diary, published, long, after, he, and, tzara, had, died, pandrea, depicted, the, poet, as, an, opportunist, accusing, him, of, adapting, his, style, to, political, requirements, of, dodging, military, service, during, world, war, i, and, of, being, a, lumpenproletarian, pandrea, s, text, completed, just, after, tzara, s, visit, to, romania, claimed, that, his, founding, role, within, the, avant, garde, was, an, illusion, which, has, swelled, up, like, a, multicolored, balloon, and, denounced, him, as, the, balkan, provider, of, interlope, odalisques, with, narcotics, and, a, sort, of, scandalous, literature, himself, an, adherent, to, communism, pandrea, grew, disillusioned, with, the, ideology, and, later, became, a, political, prisoner, in, communist, romania, vinea, s, own, grudge, probably, shows, up, in, his, 1964, novel, lunatecii, where, tzara, is, identifiable, as, dr, barbu, a, thick, hided, charlatan, from, the, 1960s, to, 1989, after, a, period, when, it, ignored, or, attacked, the, avant, garde, movement, the, romanian, communist, regime, sought, to, recuperate, tzara, in, order, to, validate, its, newly, adopted, emphasis, on, nationalist, and, national, communist, tenets, in, 1977, literary, historian, edgar, papu, whose, controversial, theories, were, linked, to, protochronism, which, presumes, that, romanians, took, precedence, in, various, areas, of, world, culture, mentioned, tzara, urmuz, ionesco, and, isou, as, representatives, of, romanian, initiatives, and, road, openers, at, a, universal, level, elements, of, protochronism, in, this, area, paul, cernat, argues, could, be, traced, back, to, vinea, s, claim, that, his, friend, had, single, handedly, created, the, worldwide, avant, garde, movement, on, the, basis, of, models, already, present, at, home
