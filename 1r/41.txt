scholar, tony, tracy, called, monroe, s, performance, the, most, mature, interpretation, of, her, career, and, geoffrey, mcnab, of, the, independent, praised, her, extraordinary, portrayal, of, the, character, s, power, of, empathy, monroe, was, next, to, star, in, a, television, adaptation, of, w, somerset, maugham, s, rain, for, nbc, but, the, project, fell, through, as, the, network, did, not,

of, the, next, six, weeks, but, despite, confirmations, by, multiple, doctors, the, studio, pressured, her, by, alleging, publicly, that, she, was, faking, it, on, may, 19, she, took, a, break, to, sing, happy, birthday, mr, president, on, stage, at, president, john, f, kennedy, s, early, birthday, celebration, at, madison, square, garden, in, new, york, she, drew, attention, with, her, costume, a, beige, skintight, dress, covered, in, rhinestones, which, made, her, appear, as, if, she, were, nude, monroe, s, trip, to, new, york, caused, even, more, irritation, for, fox, executives, who, had, wanted, her, to, cancel, it, monroe, next, filmed, a, scene, for, something, s, got, to, give, in, which, she, swam, naked, in, a, swimming, pool, to, generate, advance, publicity, the, press, was,

other, than, monroe, fox, sued, him, as, well, and, shut, down, the, production, the, studio, blamed, monroe, for, the, film, s, demise, and, began, spreading, negative, publicity, about, her, even, alleging, that, she, was, mentally, disturbed, fox, soon, regretted, its, decision, and, reopened, negotiations, with, monroe, later, in, june, a, settlement, about, a, new, contract, including, recommencing, something, s, got, to, give, and, a, starring, role, in, the, black, comedy, what, a, way, to, go, 1964, was, reached, later, that, summer, she, was, also, planning, on, starring, in, a, biopic, of, jean, harlow, to, repair, her, public, image, monroe, engaged, in, several, publicity, ventures, including, interviews, for, life, and, cosmopolitan, and, her, first, photo, shoot, for, vogue, for, vogue, she, and, photographer, bert, stern, collaborated, for, two, series, of, photographs, over, three, days, one, a, standard, fashion, editorial, and, another, of, her, posing, nude, which, were, published, posthumously, with, the, title, the, last, sitting, during, her, final, months, monroe, lived, at, 12305, fifth, helena, drive, in, the, brentwood, neighborhood, of, los, angeles, her, housekeeper, eunice, murray, was, staying, overnight, at, the, home, on, the, evening, of, august, 4, 1962, murray, woke, at, 3, 00, a, m, on, august, 5, and, sensed, that, something, was, wrong, she, saw, light, from, under, monroe, s, bedroom, door, but, was, unable, to, get, a, response, and, found, the, door, locked, murray, then, called, monroe, s, psychiatrist, ralph, greenson, who, arrived, at, the, house, shortly, after, and, broke, into, the, bedroom, through, a, window, he, found, a, nude, monroe, dead, in, her, bed, covered, by, a, sheet, with, her, hand, clamped, around, a, telephone, receiver, monroe, s, physician, hyman, engelberg, arrived, at, around, 3, 50, a, m, and, pronounced, her, dead, at, 4, 25, a, m, the, los, angeles, police, department, was, notified, monroe, died, between, 8, 30, p, m, and, 10, 30, p, m, on, august, 4, the, toxicology, report, showed, that, the, cause, of, death, was, acute, barbiturate, poisoning, she, had, 8, mg, milligrams, per, 100, milliliters, of, solution, chloral, hydrate, and, 4, 5, mg, of, pentobarbital, nembutal, in, her, blood, and, 13, mg, of, pentobarbital, in, her, liver, empty, medicine, bottles, were, found, next, to, her, bed, the, possibility, that, monroe, had, accidentally, overdosed, was, ruled, out, because, the, dosages, found, in, her, body, were, several, times, the, lethal, limit, the, los, angeles, county, coroners, office, was, assisted, in, their, investigation, by, the, los, angeles, suicide, prevention, team, who, had, expert, knowledge, on, suicide, monroe, s, doctors, stated, that, she, had, been, prone, to, severe, fears, and, frequent, depressions, with, abrupt, and, unpredictable, mood, changes, and, had, overdosed, several, times, in, the, past, possibly, intentionally, due, to, these, facts, and, the, lack, of, any, indication, of, foul, play, deputy, coroner, thomas, noguchi, classified, her, death, as, a, probable, suicide, however, in, an, interview, with, ina, fr, monroe, s, older, half, sister, berniece, baker, miracle, said, i, don, t, think, she, committed, suicide, it, could, have, been, an, accident, because, i, had, just, talked, to, her, a, short, time, before, she, told, me, what, she, had, planned, to, do, she, had, just, bought, a, new, house, and, she, was, working, on, the, curtains, of, the, windows, she, had, so, many, things, to, look, forward, to, and, she, was, so, happy, monroe, s, sudden, death, was, front, page, news, in, the, united, states, and, europe, according, to, historian, lois, banner, it, s, said, that, the, suicide, rate, in, los, angeles, doubled, the, month, after, she, died, the, circulation, rate, of, most, newspapers, expanded, that, month, and, the, chicago, tribune, reported, that, they, had, received, hundreds, of, phone, calls, from, members, of, the, public, requesting, information, about, her, death, french, artist, jean, cocteau, commented, that, her, death, should, serve, as, a, terrible, lesson, to, all, those, whose, chief, occupation, consists, of, spying, on, and, tormenting, film, stars, her, former, co, star, laurence, olivier, deemed, her, the, complete, victim, of, ballyhoo, and, sensation, and, bus, stop, director, joshua, logan, said, that, she, was, one, of, the, most, unappreciated, people, in, the, world, her, funeral, held, at, the, westwood, village, memorial, park, cemetery, on, august, 8, was, private, and, attended, by, only, her, closest, associates, the, service, was, arranged, by, dimaggio, miracle, and, monroe, s, business, manager, inez, melson, dimaggio, having, claimed, her, body, was, the, only, of, her, ex, husbands, to, attend, monroe, s, mother, who, was, confined, to, a, sanatorium, at, the, time, did, not, attend, either, as, she, was, not, informed, her, daughter, had, died, dimaggio, barred, the, kennedy, family, from, attending, as, well, as, most, of, hollywood, saying, tell, them, if, it, wasn, t, for, them, she, d, still, be, here, she, was, adorned, in, a, simple, green, emilio, pucci, dress, and, green, scarf, with, baby, pink, roses, and, champagne, silk, lining, her, twin, bronze, casket, dimaggio, was, distraught, at, the, funeral, kissing, monroe, s, body, and, saying, i, love, you, i, love, you, hundreds, of, spectators, crowded, the, streets, around, the, cemetery, monroe, was, later, entombed, at, the, corridor, of, memories, for, 20, years, after, her, death, dimaggio, sent, roses, to, monroe, s, grave, in, the, following, decades, several, conspiracy, theories, including, murder, and, accidental, overdose, have, been, introduced, to, contradict, suicide, as, the, cause, of, monroe, s, death, the, speculation, that, monroe, had, been, murdered, first, gained, mainstream, attention, with, the, publication, of, norman, mailer, s, marilyn, a, biography, in, 1973, and, in, the, following, years, became, widespread, enough, for, the, los, angeles, county, district, attorney, john, van, de, kamp, to, conduct, a, threshold, investigation, in, 1982, to, see, whether, a, criminal, investigation, should, be, opened, no, evidence, of, foul, play, was, found, the, 1940s, had, been, the, heyday, for, actresses, who, were, perceived, as, tough, and, smart, such, as, katharine, hepburn, and, barbara, stanwyck, who, had, appealed, to, women, dominated, audiences, during, the, war, years, 20th, century, fox, wanted, monroe, to, be, a, star, of, the, new, decade, who, would, draw, men, to, movie, theaters, and, saw, her, as, a, replacement, for, the, aging, betty, grable, their, most, popular, blonde, bombshell, of, the, 1940s, according, to, film, scholar, richard, dyer, monroe, s, star, image, was, crafted, mostly, for, the, male, gaze, from, the, beginning, monroe, played, a, significant, part, in, the, creation, of, her, public, image, and, towards, the, end, of, her, career, exerted, almost, full, control, over, it, she, devised, many, of, her, publicity, strategies, cultivated, friendships, with, gossip, columnists, such, as, sidney, skolsky, and, louella, parsons, and, controlled, the, use, of, her, images, in, addition, to, grable, she, was, often, compared, to, another, well, known, blonde, 1930s, film, star, jean, harlow, the, comparison, was, prompted, partly, by, monroe, who, named, harlow, as, her, childhood, idol, wanted, to, play, her, in, a, biopic, and, even, employed, harlow, s, hair, stylist, to, color, her, hair, monroe, s, screen, persona, focused, on, her, blonde, hair, and, the, stereotypes, that, were, associated, with, it, especially, dumbness, na, vet, sexual, availability, and, artificiality, she, often, used, a, breathy, childish, voice, in, her, films, and, in, interviews, gave, the, impression, that, everything, she, said, was, utterly, innocent, and, uncalculated, parodying, herself, with, double, entendres, that, came, to, be, known, as, monroeisms, for, example, when, she, was, asked, what, she, had, on, in, the, 1949, nude, photo, shoot, she, replied, i, had, the, radio, on, in, her, films, monroe, usually, played, the, beautiful, blonde, girl, who, is, defined, solely, by, her, gender, her, roles, were, almost, always, chorus, girls, secretaries, or, models, occupations, where, the, woman, is, on, show, there, for, the, pleasure, of, men, monroe, began, her, career, as, a, pin, up, model, and, was, noted, for, her, hourglass, figure, she, was, often, positioned, in, film, scenes, so, that, her, curvy, silhouette, was, on, display, and, frequently, posed, like, a, pin, up, in, publicity, photos, her, distinctive, hip, swinging, walk, also, drew, attention, to, her, body, and, earned, her, the, nickname, the, girl, with, the, horizontal, walk, monroe, often, wore, white, to, emphasize, her, blondness, and, drew, attention, by, wearing, revealing, outfits, that, showed, off, her, figure, her, publicity, stunts, often, revolved, around, her, clothing, either, being, shockingly, revealing, or, even, malfunctioning, such, as, when, a, shoulder, strap, of, her, dress, snapped, during, a, press, conference, in, press, stories, monroe, was, portrayed, as, the, embodiment, of, the, american, dream, a, girl, who, had, risen, from, a, miserable, childhood, to, hollywood, stardom, stories, of, her, time, spent, in, foster, families, and, an, orphanage, were, exaggerated, and, even, partly, fabricated, film, scholar, thomas, harris, wrote, that, her, working, class, roots, and, lack, of, family, made, her, appear, more, sexually, available, the, ideal, playmate, in, contrast, to, her, contemporary, grace, kelly, who, was, also, marketed, as, an, attractive, blonde, but, due, to, her, upper, class, background, was, seen, as, a, sophisticated, actress, unattainable, for, the, majority, of, male, viewers, although, monroe, s, screen, persona, as, a, dim, witted, but, sexually, attractive, blonde, was, a, carefully, crafted, act, audiences, and, film, critics, believed, it, to, be, her, real, personality, this, became, a, hindrance, when, she, wanted, to, pursue, other, kinds, of, roles, or, to, be, respected, as, a, businesswoman, the, academic, sarah, churchwell, studied, narratives, about, monroe, and, wrote, the, biggest, myth, is, that, she, was, dumb, the, second, is, that, she, was, fragile, the, third, is, that, she, couldn, t, act, she, was, far, from, dumb, although, she, was, not, formally, educated, and, she, was, very, sensitive, about, that, but, she, was, very, smart, indeed, and, very, tough, she, had, to, be, both, to, beat, the, hollywood, studio, system, in, the, 1950s, the, dumb, blonde, was, a, role, she, was, an, actress, for, heaven, s, sake, such, a, good, actress, that, no, one, now, believes, she, was, anything, but, what, she, portrayed, on, screen, biographer, lois, banner, writes, that, monroe, often, subtly, parodied, her, sex, symbol, status, in, her, films, and, public, appearances, and, that, the, marilyn, monroe, character, she, created, was, a, brilliant, archetype, who, stands, between, mae, west, and, madonna, in, the, tradition, of, twentieth, century, gender, tricksters, monroe, herself, stated, that, she, was, influenced, by, west, learning, a, few, tricks, from, her, that, impression, of, laughing, at, or, mocking, her, own, sexuality, she, studied, comedy, in, classes, by, mime, and, dancer, lotte, goslar, famous, for, her, comic, stage, performances, and, goslar, also, instructed, her, on, film, sets, in, gentlemen, prefer, blondes, one, of, the, films, in, which, she, played, an, archetypal, dumb, blonde, monroe, had, the, sentence, i, can, be, smart, when, it, s, important, but, most, men, don, t, like, it, added, to, her, character, s, lines, according, to, dyer, monroe, became, virtually, a, household, name, for, sex, in, the, 1950s, and, her, image, has, to, be, situated, in, the, flux, of, ideas, about, morality, and, sexuality, that, characterised, the, fifties, in, america, such, as, freudian, ideas, about, sex, the, kinsey, report, 1953, and, betty, friedan, s, the, feminine, mystique, 1963, by, appearing, vulnerable, and, unaware, of, her, sex, appeal, monroe, was, the, first, sex, symbol, to, present, sex, as, natural, and, without, danger, in, contrast, to, the, 1940s, femmes, fatales, spoto, likewise, describes, her, as, the, embodiment, of, the, postwar, ideal, of, the, american, girl, soft, transparently, needy, worshipful, of, men, na, ve, offering, sex, without, demands, which, is, echoed, in, molly, haskell, s, statement, that, she, was, the, fifties, fiction, the, lie, that, a, woman, had, no, sexual, needs, that, she, is, there, to, cater, to, or, enhance, a, man, s, needs, monroe, s, contemporary, norman, mailer, wrote, that, marilyn, suggested, sex, might, be, difficult, and, dangerous, with, others, but, ice, cream, with, her, while, groucho, marx, characterized, her, as, mae, west, theda, bara, and, bo, peep, all, rolled, into, one, according, to, haskell, due, to, her, sex, symbol, status, monroe, was, less, popular, with, women, than, with, men, as, they, couldn, t, identify, with, her, and, didn, t, support, her, although, this, would, change, after, her, death, dyer, has, also, argued, that, monroe, s, blonde, hair, became, her, defining, feature, because, it, made, her, racially, unambiguous, and, exclusively, white, just, as, the, civil, rights, movement, was, beginning, and, that, she, should, be, seen, as, emblematic, of, racism, in, twentieth, century, popular, culture, banner, agreed, that, it, may, not, be, a, coincidence, that, monroe, launched, a, trend, of, platinum, blonde, actresses, during, the, civil, rights, movement, but, has, also, criticized, dyer, pointing, out, that, in, her, highly, publicized, private, life, monroe, associated, with, people, who, were, seen, as, white, ethnics, such, as, joe, dimaggio, italian, american, and, arthur, miller, jewish, according, to, banner, she, sometimes, challenged, prevailing, racial, norms, in, her, publicity, photographs, for, example, in, an, image, featured, in, look, in, 1951, she, was, shown, in, revealing, clothes, while, practicing, with, african, american, singing, coach, phil, moore, monroe, was, perceived, as, a, specifically, american, star, a, national, institution, as, well, known, as, hot, dogs, apple, pie, or, baseball, according, to, photoplay, banner, calls, her, the, symbol, of, populuxe, a, star, whose, joyful, and, glamorous, public, image, helped, the, nation, cope, with, its, paranoia, in, the, 1950s, about, the, cold, war, the, atom, bomb, and, the, totalitarian, communist, soviet, union, historian, fiona, handyside, writes, that, the, french, female, audiences, associated, whiteness, blondness, with, american, modernity, and, cleanliness, and, so, monroe, came, to, symbolize, a, modern, liberated, woman, whose, life, takes, place, in, the, public, sphere, film, historian, laura, mulvey, has, written, of, her, as, an, endorsement, for, american, consumer, culture, if, america, was, to, export, the, democracy, of, glamour, into, post, war, impoverished, europe, the, movies, could, be, its, shop, window, marilyn, monroe, with, her, all, american, attributes, and, streamlined, sexuality, came, to, epitomise, in, a, single, image, this, complex, interface, of, the, economic, the, political, and, the, erotic, by, the, mid, 1950s, she, stood, for, a, brand, of, classless, glamour, available, to, anyone, using, american, cosmetics, nylons, and, peroxide, twentieth, century, fox, further, profited, from, monroe, s, popularity, by, cultivating, several, lookalike, actresses, such, as, jayne, mansfield, and, sheree, north, other, studios, also, attempted, to, create, their, own, monroes, universal, pictures, with, mamie, van, doren, columbia, pictures, with, kim, novak, and, the, rank, organization, with, diana, dors, in, a, profile, truman, capote, quoted, monroe, s, acting, teacher, constance, collier, she, is, a, beautiful, child, i, don, t, mean, that, in, the, obvious, way, the, perhaps, too, obvious, way, i, don, t, think, she, s, an, actress, at, all, not, in, any, traditional, sense, what, she, has, this, presence, this, luminosity, this, flickering, intelligence, could, never, surface, on, the, stage, it, s, so, fragile, and, subtle, it, can, only, be, caught, by, the, camera, it, s, like, a, hummingbird, in, flight, only, a, camera, can, freeze, the, poetry, of, it, according, to, the, guide, to, united, states, popular, culture, as, an, icon, of, american, popular, culture, monroe, s, few, rivals, in, popularity, include, elvis, presley, and, mickey, mouse, no, other, star, has, ever, inspired, such, a, wide, range, of, emotions, from, lust, to, pity, from, envy, to, remorse, art, historian, gail, levin, stated, that, monroe, may, have, been, the, most, photographed, person, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, american, film, institute, has, named, her, the, sixth, greatest, female, screen, legend, in, american, film, history, the, smithsonian, institution, has, included, her, on, their, list, of, 100, most, significant, americans, of, all, time, and, both, variety, and, vh1, have, placed, her, in, the, top, ten, in, their, rankings, of, the, greatest, popular, culture, icons, of, the, twentieth, century, hundreds, of, books, have, been, written, about, monroe, she, has, been, the, subject, of, numerous, films, plays, operas, and, songs, and, has, influenced, artists, and, entertainers, such, as, andy, warhol, and, madonna, she, also, remains, a, valuable, brand, her, image, and, name, have, been, licensed, for, hundreds, of, products, and, she, has, been, featured, in, advertising, for, brands, such, as, max, factor, chanel, mercedes, benz, and, absolut, vodka, monroe, s, enduring, popularity, is, tied, to, her, conflicted, public, image, on, the, one, hand, she, remains, a, sex, symbol, beauty, icon, and, one, of, the, most, famous, stars, of, classical, hollywood, cinema, on, the, other, she, is, also, remembered, for, her, troubled, private, life, unstable, childhood, struggle, for, professional, respect, as, well, as, her, death, and, the, conspiracy, theories, that, surrounded, it, she, has, been, written, about, by, scholars, and, journalists, who, are, interested, in, gender, and, feminism, these, writers, include, gloria, steinem, jacqueline, rose, molly, haskell, sarah, churchwell, and, lois, banner, some, such, as, steinem, have, viewed, her, as, a, victim, of, the, studio, system, others, such, as, haskell, rose, and, churchwell, have, instead, stressed, monroe, s, proactive, role, in, her, career, and, her, participation, in, the, creation, of, her, public, persona, owing, to, the, contrast, between, her, stardom, and, troubled, private, life, monroe, is, closely, linked, to, broader, discussions, about, modern, phenomena, such, as, mass, media, fame, and, consumer, culture, according, to, academic, susanne, hamscha, monroe, has, continued, relevance, to, ongoing, discussions, about, modern, society, and, she, is, never, completely, situated, in, one, time, or, place, but, has, become, a, surface, on, which, narratives, of, american, culture, can, be, re, constructed, and, functions, as, a, cultural, type, that, can, be, reproduced, transformed, translated, into, new, contexts, and, enacted, by, other, people, similarly, banner, has, called, monroe, the, eternal, shapeshifter, who, is, re, created, by, each, generation, even, each, individual, to, their, own, specifications, monroe, remains, a, cultural, icon, but, critics, are, divided, on, her, legacy, as, an, actress, david, thomson, called, her, body, of, work, insubstantial, and, pauline, kael, wrote, that, she, could, not, act, but, rather, used, her, lack, of, an, actress, s, skills, to, amuse, the, public, she, had, the, wit, or, crassness, or, desperation, to, turn, cheesecake, into, acting, and, vice, versa, she, did, what, others, had, the, good, taste, not, to, do, in, contrast, peter, bradshaw, wrote, that, monroe, was, a, talented, comedian, who, understood, how, comedy, achieved, its, effects, and, roger, ebert, wrote, that, monroe, s, eccentricities, and, neuroses, on, sets, became, notorious, but, studios, put, up, with, her, long, after, any, other, actress, would, have, been, blackballed, because, what, they, got, back, on, the, screen, was, magical, similarly, jonathan, rosenbaum, stated, that, she, subtly, subverted, the, sexist, content, of, her, material, and, that, the, difficulty, some, people, have, discerning, monroe, s, intelligence, as, an, actress, seems, rooted, in, the, ideology, of, a, repressive, era, when, super, feminine, women, weren, t, supposed, to, be, smart, in, 2024, the, los, angeles, city, council, approved, monroe, s, house, in, brentwood, los, angeles, being, designated, as, a, historic, cultural, monument
