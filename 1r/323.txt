in, 1973, it, was, panned, critically, in, thomas, s, hischak, s, book, american, literature, on, stage, and, screen, breakfast, of, champions, was, called, funny, and, outlandish, but, reviewers, noted, that, it, lacks, substance, and, seems, to, be, an, exercise, in, literary, playfulness, vonnegut, s, 1976, novel, slapstick, which, meditates, on, the, relationship, between, him, and, his,

before, and, that, it, still, seems, as, if, he, has, given, up, storytelling, after, all, at, times, vonnegut, was, disgruntled, by, the, personal, nature, of, his, detractors, complaints, in, subsequent, years, his, popularity, resurged, as, he, published, several, satirical, books, including, jailbird, 1979, deadeye, dick, 1982, gal, pagos, 1985, bluebeard, 1987, and, hocus, pocus, 1990,

forced, to, find, other, sorts, of, seemingly, important, work, to, do, the, couple, battled, over, their, differing, beliefs, until, vonnegut, moved, from, their, cape, cod, home, to, new, york, in, 1971, vonnegut, called, the, disagreements, painful, and, said, that, the, resulting, split, was, a, terrible, unavoidable, accident, that, we, were, ill, equipped, to, understand, the, couple,

when, the, baby, was, three, days, old, they, remained, married, until, his, death, vonnegut, s, sincerity, his, willingness, to, scoff, at, received, wisdom, is, such, that, reading, his, work, for, the, first, time, gives, one, the, sense, that, everything, else, is, rank, hypocrisy, his, opinion, of, human, nature, was, low, and, that, low, opinion, applied, to, his, heroes, and, his, villains, alike, he, was, endlessly, disappointed, in, humanity, and, in, himself, and, he, expressed, that, disappointment, in, a, mixture, of, tar, black, humor, and, deep, despair, he, could, easily, have, become, a, crank, but, he, was, too, smart, he, could, have, become, a, cynic, but, there, was, something, tender, in, his, nature, that, he, could, never, quite, suppress, he, could, have, become, a, bore, but, even, at, his, most, despairing, he, had, an, endless, willingness, to, entertain, his, readers, with, drawings, jokes, sex, bizarre, plot, twists, science, fiction, whatever, it, took,

actually, succeed, in, representing, the, shifting, multiplicities, of, that, social, experience, is, beside, the, point, what, matters, is, the, attempt, and, the, recognition, that, we, must, try,

of, the, american, humanist, association, in, an, interview, for, playboy, he, stated, that, his, forebears, who, came, to, the, united, states, did, not, believe, in, god, and, he, learned, his, atheism, from, his, parents, vonnegut, did, not, however, disdain, those, who, seek, the, comfort, of, religion, hailing, church, associations, as, a, type, of, extended, family, he, occasionally, attended, a, unitarian, church, but, with, little, consistency, in, his, autobiographical, work, palm, sunday, vonnegut, says, that, he, is, a, christ, worshipping, agnostic, during, a, speech, to, the, unitarian, universalist, association, he, called, himself, a, christ, loving, atheist, however, he, was, keen, to, stress, that, he, was, not, a, christian, vonnegut, was, an, admirer, of, jesus, sermon, on, the, mount, particularly, the, beatitudes, and, incorporated, it, into, his, own, doctrines, he, also, referred, to, it, in, many, of, his, works, in, his, 1991, book, fates, worse, than, death, vonnegut, suggests, that, during, the, reagan, administration, anything, that, sounded, like, the, sermon, on, the, mount, was, socialistic, or, communistic, and, therefore, anti, american, in, palm, sunday, he, wrote, that, the, sermon, on, the, mount, suggests, a, mercifulness, that, can, never, waver, or, fade, however, vonnegut, had, a, deep, dislike, for, certain, aspects, of, christianity, often, reminding, his, readers, of, the, bloody, history, of, the, crusades, and, other, religion, inspired, violence, he, despised, the, televangelists, of, the, late, 20th, century, feeling, that, their, thinking, was, narrow, minded, religion, features, frequently, in, vonnegut, s, work, both, in, his, novels, and, elsewhere, he, laced, a, number, of, his, speeches, with, religion, focused, rhetoric, and, was, prone, to, using, such, expressions, as, god, forbid, and, thank, god, he, once, wrote, his, own, version, of, the, requiem, mass, which, he, then, had,

part, by, robert, redfield, an, anthropologist, at, the, university, of, chicago, co, founder, of, the, committee, on, social, thought, and, one, of, vonnegut, s, professors, during, his, time, at, the, university, in, a, commencement, address, vonnegut, remarked, that, dr, redfield, s, theory, of, the, folk, society, has, been, the, starting, point, for, my, politics, such, as, they, are, vonnegut, did, not, particularly, sympathize, with, liberalism, or, conservatism, and, mused, on, the, specious, simplicity, of, american, politics, saying, facetiously, if, you, want, to, take, my, guns, away, from, me, and, you, re, all, for, murdering, fetuses, and, love, it, when, homosexuals, marry, each, other, you, re, a, liberal, if, you, are, against, those, perversions, and, for, the, rich, you, re, a, conservative, what, could, be, simpler, regarding, political, parties, vonnegut, said, the, two, real, political, parties, in, america, are, the, winners, and, the, losers, the, people, don, t, acknowledge, this, they, claim, membership, in, two, imaginary, parties, the, republicans, and, the, democrats, instead, vonnegut, disregarded, more, mainstream, american, political, ideologies, in, favor, of, socialism, which, he, thought, could, provide, a, valuable, substitute, for, what, he, saw, as, social, darwinism, and, a, spirit, of, survival, of, the, fittest, in, american, society, believing, that, socialism, would, be, a, good, for, the, common, man, vonnegut, would, often, return, to, a, quote, by, socialist, and, five, time, presidential, candidate, eugene,

expressed, disappointment, that, communism, and, socialism, seemed, to, be, unsavory, topics, to, the, average, american, and, believed, that, they, offered, beneficial, substitutes, to, contemporary, social, and, economic, systems, in, a, man, without, a, country, vonnegut, quipped, i, have, been, called, a, luddite, i, welcome, it, do, you, know, what, a, luddite, is, a, person, who, hates, newfangled, contraptions, the, negative, effects, of, the, progress, of, technology, is, a, constant, theme, throughout, vonnegut, s, works, from, player, piano, to, his, final, essay, collection, a, man, without, a, country, political, theorist, patrick, deneen, has, identified, this, skepticism, of, technological, progress, as, a, theme, of, vonnegut, novels, and, stories, including, player,

vonnegut, described, player, piano, some, years, after, its, publication, as, a, novel, about, people, and, machines, and, machines, frequently, got, the, best, of, it, as, machines, will, loss, of, jobs, due, to, machine, innovation, and, thus, loss, of, meaning, or, purpose, in, life, is, a, key, plot, point, in, the, novel, the, newfangled, contraptions, vonnegut, hated, included, the, television, which, he, critiqued, often, throughout, his, non, fiction, and, fiction, in, timequake, for, example, vonnegut, tells, the, story, of, booboolings, human, analogs, who, develop, morally, through, their, imaginative, formation, however, one, evil, sister, on, the, planet, of, the, booboolings, learns, to, build, televisions, from, lunatics, he, writes, when, the, bad, sister, was, a, young, woman, she, and, the, nuts, worked, up, designs, for, television, cameras, and, transmitters, and, receivers, then, she, got, money, from, her, very, rich, mom, to, manufacture, these, satanic, devices, which, made, imaginations, redundant, they, were, instantly, popular, because, the, shows, were, so, attractive, and, no, thinking, was, involved, generations, of, booboolings, grew, up, without, imaginations, without, imaginations, though, they, couldn, t, do, what, their, ancestors, had, done, which, was, read, interesting, heartwarming, stories, in, the, faces, of, one, another, so, booboolings, became, among, the, most, merciless, creatures, in, the, local, family, of, galaxies, against, imagination, killing, devices, like, televisions, and, against, electronic, substitutes, for, embodied, community, vonnegut, argued, that, electronic, communities, build, nothing, you, wind, up, with, nothing, we, are, dancing, animals, how, beautiful, it, is, to, get, up, and, go, out, and, do, something, vonnegut, s, writing, was, inspired, by, an, eclectic, mix, of, sources, when, he, was, younger, vonnegut, stated, that, he, read, works, of, pulp, fiction, science, fiction, fantasy, and, action, adventure, he, also, read, the, classics, such, as, the, plays, of, aristophanes, like, vonnegut, s, works, humorous, critiques, of, contemporary, society, vonnegut, s, life, and, work, also, share, similarities, with, that, of, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, writer, mark, twain, both, shared, pessimistic, outlooks, on, humanity, and, a, skeptical, take, on, religion, and, as, vonnegut, put, it, were, both, associated, with, the, enemy, in, a, major, war, as, twain, briefly, enlisted, in, the, south, s, cause, during, the, american, civil, war, and, vonnegut, s, german, name, and, ancestry, connected, him, with, the, united, states, enemy, in, both, world, wars, he, also, cited, ambrose, bierce, as, an, influence, calling, an, occurrence, at, owl, creek, bridge, the, greatest, american, short, story, and, deeming, any, who, disagreed, or, had, not, read, the, story, twerps, vonnegut, called, george, orwell, his, favorite, writer, and, admitted, that, he, tried, to, emulate, orwell, i, like, his, concern, for, the, poor, i, like, his, socialism, i, like, his, simplicity, vonnegut, said, vonnegut, also, said, that, orwell, s, nineteen, eighty, four, and, brave, new, world, by, aldous, huxley, heavily, influenced, his, debut, novel, player, piano, in, 1952, the, novel, also, included, ideas, from, mathematician, norbert, wiener, s, book, cybernetics, or, control, and, communication, in, the, animal, and, the, machine, vonnegut, commented, that, robert, louis, stevenson, s, stories, were, emblems, of, thoughtfully, put, together, works, that, he, tried, to, mimic, in, his, own, compositions, vonnegut, also, hailed, playwright, and, socialist, george, bernard, shaw, as, a, hero, of, and, an, enormous, influence, within, his, own, family, vonnegut, stated, that, his, mother, edith, had, the, greatest, influence, on, him, mother, thought, she, might, make, a, new, fortune, by, writing, for, the, slick, magazines, she, took, short, story, courses, at, night, she, studied, writers, the, way, gamblers, study, horses, early, on, in, his, career, vonnegut, decided, to, model, his, style, after, henry, david, thoreau, who, wrote, as, if, from, the, perspective, of, a, child, allowing, thoreau, s, works, to, be, more, widely, comprehensible, using, a, youthful, narrative, voice, allowed, vonnegut, to, deliver, concepts, in, a, modest, and, straightforward, way, other, influences, on, vonnegut, include, the, war, of, the, worlds, author, h, g, wells, and, satirist, jonathan, swift, vonnegut, credited, american, journalist, and, critic, h, l, mencken, for, inspiring, him, to, become, a, journalist, the, book, pity, the, reader, on, writing, with, style, by, kurt, vonnegut, and, his, longtime, friend, and, former, student, suzanne, mcconnell, published, posthumously, by, rosetta, books, and, seven, stories, press, in, 2019, delves, into, the, style, humor, and, methodologies, vonnegut, employed, including, his, belief, that, one, should, write, like, a, human, being, write, like, a, writer, i, ve, heard, the, vonnegut, voice, described, as, manic, depressive, and, there, s, certainly, something, to, this, it, has, an, incredible, amount, of, energy, married, to, a, very, deep, and, dark, sense, of, despair, it, s, frequently, over, the, top, and, scathingly, satirical, but, it, never, strays, too, far, from, pathos, from, an, immense, sympathy, for, society, s, vulnerable, oppressed, and, powerless, but, then, it, also, contains, a, huge, allotment, of, warmth, most, of, the, time, reading, kurt, vonnegut, feels, more, like, being, spoken, to, by, a, very, close, friend, there, s, an, inclusiveness, to, his, writing, that, draws, you, in, and, his, narrative, voice, is, seldom, absent, from, the, story, for, any, length, of, time, usually, it, s, right, there, in, the, foreground, direct, involving, and, extremely, idiosyncratic, gavin, extence, the, huffington, post, 2013, in, his, book, popular, contemporary, writers, michael, d, sharp, describes, vonnegut, s, linguistic, style, as, straightforward, his, sentences, concise, his, language, simple, his, paragraphs, brief, and, his, ordinary, tone, conversational, vonnegut, uses, this, style, to, convey, normally, complex, subject, matter, in, a, way, that, is, intelligible, to, a, large, audience, he, credited, his, time, as, a, journalist, for, his, ability, and, pointed, to, his, work, with, the, chicago, city, news, bureau, which, required, him, to, convey, stories, in, telephone, conversations, vonnegut, s, compositions, include, distinct, references, to, his, own, life, notably, in, slaughterhouse, five, and, slapstick, vonnegut, believed, that, ideas, and, the, convincing, communication, of, those, ideas, to, the, reader, were, vital, to, literary, art, he, did, not, always, sugarcoat, his, points, much, of, player, piano, leads, to, the, moment, when, paul, on, trial, and, hooked, to, a, lie, detector, is, asked, to, tell, a, falsehood, paul, states, every, new, piece, of, scientific, knowledge, is, a, good, thing, for, humanity, robert, t, tally, jr, in, his, volume, on, vonnegut, s, novels, wrote, rather, than, tearing, down, and, destroying, the, icons, of, twentieth, century, middle, class, american, life, vonnegut, gently, reveals, their, basic, flimsiness, vonnegut, did, not, simply, propose, utopian, solutions, to, the, ills, of, american, society, but, showed, how, such, schemes, would, not, allow, ordinary, people, to, live, lives, free, from, want, and, anxiety, the, large, artificial, u, s, families, in, slapstick, soon, serve, as, an, excuse, for, tribalism, people, give, no, help, to, those, not, part, of, their, group, the, extended, family, s, place, in, the, social, hierarchy, becomes, vital, in, the, introduction, to, their, essay, kurt, vonnegut, and, humor, tally, and, peter, c, kunze, suggest, that, vonnegut, was, not, a, black, humorist, but, a, frustrated, idealist, who, used, comic, parables, to, teach, the, reader, absurd, bitter, or, hopeless, truths, with, his, grim, witticisms, serving, to, make, the, reader, laugh, rather, than, cry, vonnegut, makes, sense, through, humor, which, is, in, the, author, s, view, as, valid, a, means, of, mapping, this, crazy, world, as, any, other, strategies, vonnegut, resented, being, called, a, black, humorist, feeling, that, as, with, many, literary, labels, it, allows, readers, to, disregard, aspects, of, a, writer, s, work, that, do, not, fit, the, label, vonnegut, s, works, have, been, labeled, science, fiction, satire, and, postmodern, he, resisted, such, labels, but, his, works, do, contain, common, tropes, in, those, genres, in, his, books, vonnegut, imagines, alien, societies, and, civilizations, as, is, common, in, science, fiction, vonnegut, emphasizes, or, exaggerates, absurdities, and, idiosyncrasies, furthermore, vonnegut, makes, fun, of, problems, as, satire, does, however, literary, theorist, robert, scholes, noted, in, fabulation, and, metafiction, that, vonnegut, reject, the, traditional, satirist, s, faith, in, the, efficacy, of, satire, as, a, reforming, instrument, a, more, subtle, faith, in, the, humanizing, value, of, laughter, postmodernism, entails, a, response, to, the, theory, that, science, will, reveal, truths, postmodernists, contend, that, truth, is, subjective, rather, than, objective, truth, includes, bias, toward, individual, beliefs, and, outlooks, on, the, world, postmodernist, writers, use, unreliable, first, person, narration, and, narrative, fragmentation, one, critic, has, argued, that, vonnegut, s, most, famous, novel, slaughterhouse, five, features, a, metafictional, janus, headed, outlook, and, seeks, to, represent, historical, events, while, doubting, the, ability, to, represent, history, doubt, is, evident, in, the, opening, lines, of, the, novel, all, this, happened, more, or, less, the, war, parts, anyway, are, pretty, much, true, the, bombastic, opening, all, this, happened, reads, like, a, declaration, of, complete, mimesis, which, is, radically, called, into, question, in, the, rest, of, the, quote, and, his, creates, an, integrated, perspective, that, seeks, out, extratextual, themes, while, thematizing, the, novel, s, textuality, and, inherent, constructedness, at, one, and, the, same, time, although, vonnegut, does, use, fragmentation, and, metafiction, in, some, of, his, works, he, more, distinctly, focuses, on, the, peril, of, individuals, who, find, subjective, truths, mistake, them, for, objective, truths, and, proceed, to, impose, these, truths, on, other, people, vonnegut, was, a, vocal, critic, of, american, society, and, this, was, reflected, in, his, writings, several, key, social, themes, recur, in, vonnegut, s, works, such, as, wealth, the, lack, of, it, and, its, unequal, distribution, among, a, society, in, the, sirens, of, titan, the, novel, s, protagonist, malachi, constant, is, exiled, to, saturn, s, moon, titan, as, a, result, of, his, vast, wealth, which, has, made, him, arrogant, and, wayward, in, god, bless, you, mr, rosewater, readers, may, find, it, difficult, to, determine, whether, the, rich, or, the, poor, are, in, worse, circumstances, as, the, lives, of, both, groups, members, are, ruled, by, their, wealth, or, their, poverty, further, in, hocus, pocus, the, protagonist, is, named, eugene, debs, hartke, a, homage, to, the, famed, socialist, eugene, v, debs, and, vonnegut, s, socialist, views, in, kurt, vonnegut, a, critical, companion, thomas, f, marvin, states, vonnegut, points, out, that, left, unchecked, capitalism, will, erode, the, democratic, foundations, of, the, united, states, marvin, suggests, that, vonnegut, s, works, demonstrate, what, happens, when, a, hereditary, aristocracy, develops, where, wealth, is, inherited, along, familial, lines, the, ability, of, poor, americans, to, overcome, their, situations, is, greatly, or, completely, diminished, vonnegut, also, often, laments, social, darwinism, and, a, survival, of, the, fittest, view, of, society, he, points, out, that, social, darwinism, leads, to, a, society, that, condemns, its, poor, for, their, own, misfortune, and, fails, to, help, them, out, of, their, poverty, because, they, deserve, their, fate, science, and, the, ethical, obligations, of, scientists, are, also, a, common, theme, in, vonnegut, s, works, his, first, published, story, report, on, the, barnhouse, effect, like, many, of, his, early, stories, centered, on, a, scientist, concerned, about, the, uses, of, his, own, invention, player, piano, and, cat, s, cradle, explore, the, effects, on, humans, of, scientific, advances, in, 1969, vonnegut, gave, a, speech, to, the, american, association, of, physics, teachers, called, the, virtuous, physicist, asked, afterwards, what, a, virtuous, scientist, was, vonnegut, replied, one, who, declines, to, work, on, weapons, vonnegut, also, confronts, the, idea, of, free, will, in, a, number, of, his, pieces, in, slaughterhouse, five, and, timequake, the, characters, have, no, choice, in, what, they, do, in, breakfast, of, champions, characters, are, very, obviously, stripped, of, their, free, will, and, even, receive, it, as, a, gift, and, in, cat, s, cradle, bokononism, views, free, will, as, heretical, the, majority, of, vonnegut, s, characters, are, estranged, from, their, actual, families, and, seek, to, build, replacement, or, extended, families, for, example, the, engineers, in, player, piano, called, their, manager, s, spouse, mom, in, cat, s, cradle, vonnegut, devises, two, separate, methods, for, loneliness, to, be, combated, a, karass, which, is, a, group, of, individuals, appointed, by, god, to, do, his, will, and, a, granfalloon, defined, by, marvin, as, a, meaningless, association, of, people, such, as, a, fraternal, group, or, a, nation, similarly, in, slapstick, the, us, government, codifies, that, all, americans, are, a, part, of, large, extended, families, fear, of, the, loss, of, one, s, purpose, in, life, is, a, theme, in, vonnegut, s, works, the, great, depression, forced, vonnegut, to, witness, the, devastation, many, people, felt, when, they, lost, their, jobs, and, while, at, general, electric, vonnegut, witnessed, machines, being, built, to, take, the, place, of, human, labor, he, confronts, these, things, in, his, works, through, references, to, the, growing, use, of, automation, and, its, effects, on, human, society, this, is, most, starkly, represented, in, his, first, novel, player, piano, where, many, americans, are, left, purposeless, and, unable, to, find, work, as, machines, replace, human, workers, loss, of, purpose, is, also, depicted, in, gal, pagos, where, a, florist, rages, at, her, spouse, for, creating, a, robot, able, to, do, her, job, and, in, timequake, where, an, architect, kills, himself, when, replaced, by, computer, software, suicide, by, fire, is, another, common, theme, in, vonnegut, s, works, the, author, often, returns, to, the, theory, that, many, people, are, not, fond, of, life, he, uses, this, as, an, explanation, for, why, humans, have, so, severely, damaged, their, environments, and, made, devices, such, as, nuclear, weapons, that, can, make, their, creators, extinct, in, deadeye, dick, vonnegut, features, the, neutron, bomb, which, is, designed, to, kill, people, but, leave, buildings, and, structures, untouched, he, also, uses, this, theme, to, demonstrate, the, recklessness, of, those, who, put, powerful, apocalypse, inducing, devices, at, the, disposal, of, politicians, what, is, the, point, of, life, is, a, question, vonnegut, often, pondered, in, his, works, when, one, of, vonnegut, s, characters, kilgore, trout, finds, the, question, what, is, the, purpose, of, life, written, in, a, bathroom, his, response, is, to, be, the, eyes, and, ears, and, conscience, of, the, creator, of, the, universe, you, fool, marvin, finds, trout, s, theory, curious, given, that, vonnegut, was, an, atheist, and, thus, for, him, there, is, no, creator, to, report, back, to, and, comments, that, trout, chronicles, one, meaningless, life, after, another, readers, are, left, to, wonder, how, a, compassionate, creator, could, stand, by, and, do, nothing, while, such, reports, come, in, in, the, epigraph, to, bluebeard, vonnegut, quotes, his, son, mark, and, gives, an, answer, to, what, he, believes, is, the, meaning, of, life, we, are, here, to, help, each, other, get, through, this, thing, whatever, it, is, unless, otherwise, cited, items, in, this, list, are, taken, from, thomas, f, marvin, s, 2002, book, kurt, vonnegut, a, critical, companion, and, the, date, in, parentheses, is, the, date, the, work, was, published
