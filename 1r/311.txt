and, situation, to, which, he, defiantly, pled, guilty, the, most, serious, charge, of, plagiarism, was, based, on, london, s, the, bishop, s, vision, chapter, 7, of, his, novel, the, iron, heel, 1908, the, chapter, is, nearly, identical, to, an, ironic, essay, that, frank, harris, published, in, 1901, titled, the, bishop, of, london, and, public, morality, harris, was, incensed, and, suggested, he, should, receive, 1, 60th, of, the, royalties, from, the, iron, heel, the, disputed, material, constituting, about, that, fraction, of, the, whole, novel, london, insisted, he, had,

the, iron, heel, neither, a, theorist, nor, an, intellectual, socialist, london, s, socialism, grew, out, of, his, life, experience, as, london, explained, in, his, essay, how, i, became, a, socialist, his, views, were, influenced, by, his, experience, with, people, at, the, bottom, of, the, social, pit, his, optimism, and, individualism, faded, and, he, vowed, never, to, do, more, hard,

regarded, the, wobblies, as, a, welcome, addition, to, the, socialist, cause, although, he, never, joined, them, in, going, so, far, as, to, recommend, sabotage, stasz, mentions, a, personal, meeting, between, london, and, big, bill, haywood, in, 1912, in, his, 1913, book, the, cruise, of, the, snark, london, writes, about, appeals, to, him, for, membership, of, the, snark, s, crew, from, office, workers, and, other, toilers, who, longed, for, escape, from, the, cities, and, of, being, cheated, by, workmen, in, his, glen, ellen, ranch, years, london, felt, some, ambivalence, toward, socialism, and, complained, about, the, inefficient, italian, labourers, in, his, employ, in, 1916, he, resigned, from, the, glen, ellen, chapter, of, the, socialist, party, in, an, unflattering, portrait, of, london, s, ranch, days, california, cultural, historian, kevin, starr, refers, to, this, period, as, post, socialist, and, says, that, by, 1911, london, was, more, bored, by, the, class, struggle, than, he, cared, to, admit, george, orwell, however, identified, a, fascist, strain, in, london, s, outlook, but, temperamentally, he, was, very, different, from, the, majority, of, marxists, with, his, love, of, violence, and, physical, strength, his, belief, in, natural, aristocracy, his, animal, worship, and, exaltation, of, the, primitive, he, had, in, him, what, one, might, fairly, call, a, fascist, strain, london, shared, common, concerns, among, many, european, americans, in, california, about, asian, immigration, described, as, the, yellow, peril, he, used, the, latter, term, as, the, title, of, a, 1904, essay, this, theme, was, also, the, subject, of, a, story, he, wrote, in, 1910, called, the, unparalleled, invasion, presented, as, an, historical, essay, set, in, the, future, the, story, narrates, events, between, 1976, and, 1987, in, which, china, with, an, ever, increasing, population, is, taking, over, and, colonizing, its, neighbors, with, the, intention, of, taking, over, the, entire, earth, the, western, nations, respond, with, biological, warfare, and, bombard, china, with, dozens, of, the, most, infectious, diseases, on, his, fears, about, china, he, admits, at, the, end, of, the, yellow, peril, it, must, be, taken, into, consideration, that, the, above, postulate, is, itself, a, product, of, western, race, egotism, urged, by, our, belief, in, our, own, righteousness, and, fostered, by, a, faith, in, ourselves, which, may, be, as, erroneous, as, are, most, fond, race, fancies, by, contrast, many, of, london, s, short, stories, are, notable, for, their, empathetic, portrayal, of, mexican, the, mexican, asian, the, chinago, and, hawaiian, koolau, the, leper, characters, london, s, war, correspondence, from, the, russo, japanese, war, as, well, as, his, unfinished, novel, cherry, show, he, admired, much, about, japanese, customs, and, capabilities, london, s, writings, have, been, popular, among, the, japanese, who, believe, he, portrayed, them, positively, in, koolau, the, leper, london, describes, koolau, who, is, a, hawaiian, leper, and, thus, a, very, different, sort, of, superman, than, martin, eden, and, who, fights, off, an, entire, cavalry, troop, to, elude, capture, as, indomitable, spiritually, a, magnificent, rebel, this, character, is, based, on, hawaiian, leper, kaluaikoolau, who, in, 1893, revolted, and, resisted,

prejudice, this, of, course, being, impossible, i, would, say, next, by, educating, the, people, of, japan, so, that, they, will, be, too, intelligently, tolerant, to, respond, to, any, call, to, race, prejudice, and, finally, by, realizing, in, industry, and, government, of, socialism, which, last, word, is, merely, a, word, that, stands, for, the, actual, application, of, in, the, affairs, of, men, of, the, theory, of, the, brotherhood, of, man, in, the, meantime, the, nations, and, races, are, only, unruly, boys, who, have, not, yet, grown, to, the, stature, of, men, so, we, must, expect, them, to, do, unruly, and, boisterous, things, at, times, and, just, as, boys, grow, up, so, the, races, of, mankind, will, grow, up, and, laugh, when, they, look, back, upon, their, childish,

used, instead, of, scab, such, as, knocker, stool, pigeon, or, scandal, monger, those, newspapers, did, not, attribute, those, sentences, to, london, this, passage, as, given, above, was, the, subject, of, a, 1974, supreme, court, case, letter, carriers, v, austin, in, which, justice, thurgood, marshall, referred, to, it, as, a, well, known, piece, of, trade, union, literature, generally, attributed, to, author, jack, london, a, union, newsletter, had, published, a, list, of, scabs, which, was, granted, to, be, factual, and, therefore, not, libelous, but, then, went, on, to, quote, the, passage, as, the, definition, of, a, scab, the, case, turned, on, the, question, of, whether, the, definition, was, defamatory, the, court, ruled, that, jack, london, s, definition, of, a, scab, is, merely, rhetorical, hyperbole, a, lusty, and, imaginative, expression, of, the, contempt, felt, by, union, members, towards, those, who, refuse, to, join, and, as, such, was, not, libelous, and, was, protected, under, the, first, amendment, despite, being, frequently, attributed, to, london, the, passage, does, not, appear, at, all, in, the, extensive, collection, of, his, writings, at, sonoma, state, university, s, website, however, in, his, book, war, of, the, classes, he, published, a, 1903, speech, titled, the, scab, which, gave, a, much, more, balanced, view, of, the, topic, the, laborer, who, gives, more, time, or, strength, or, skill, for, the, same, wage, than, another, or, equal, time, or, strength, or, skill, for, a, less, wage, is, a, scab, the, generousness, on, his, part, is, hurtful, to, his, fellow, laborers, for, it, compels, them, to, an, equal, generousness, which, is, not, to, their, liking, and, which, gives, them, less, of, food, and, shelter, but, a, word, may, be, said, for, the, scab, just, as, his, act, makes, his, rivals, compulsorily, generous, so, do, they, by, fortune, of, birth, and, training, make, compulsory, his, act, of, generousness, nobody, desires, to, scab, to, give, most, for, least, the, ambition, of, every, individual, is, quite, the, opposite, to, give, least, for, most, and, as, a, result, living, in, a, tooth, and, nail, society, battle, royal, is, waged, by, the, ambitious, individuals, but, in, its, most, salient, aspect, that, of, the, struggle, over, the, division, of, the, joint, product, it, is, no, longer, a, battle, between, individuals, but, between, groups, of, individuals, capital, and, labor, apply, themselves, to, raw, material, make, something, useful, out, of, it, add, to, its,
