diophantus, of, alexandria, born, c, ad, 200, c, 214, died, c, ad, 284, c, 298, was, a, greek, mathematician, who, was, the, author, of, two, main, works, on, polygonal, numbers, which, survives, incomplete, and, the, arithmetica, in, thirteen, books, most, of, it, extant, made, up, of, arithmetical, problems, that, are, solved, through, algebraic, equations, diophantus, was, the, first, greek, mathematician, who, recognized, positive, rational, numbers, as, numbers, by, allowing, fractions, for, coefficients, and, solutions, he, coined, the, term, parisot, s, to, refer, to, an, approximate, equality, this, term, was, rendered, as, adaequalitas, in, latin, and, became, the, technique, of, adequality, developed, by, pierre, de, fermat, to, find, maxima, for, functions, and, tangent, lines, to, curves, although, not, the, earliest, the, arithmetica, has, the, best, known, use, of, algebraic, notation, to, solve, arithmetical, problems, coming, from, greek, antiquity, and, some, of, its, problems, served, as, inspiration, for, later, mathematicians, working, in, analysis, and, number, theory, in, modern, use, diophantine, equations, are, algebraic, equations, with, integer, coefficients, for, which, integer, solutions, are, sought, diophantine, geometry, and, diophantine, approximations, are, two, other, subareas, of, number, theory, that, are, named, after, him, diophantus, was, born, into, a, greek, family, and, is, known, to, have, lived, in, alexandria, egypt, during, the, roman, era, between, ad, 200, and, 214, to, 284, or, 298, much, of, our, knowledge, of, the, life, of, diophantus, is, derived, from, a, 5th, century, greek, anthology, of, number, games, and, puzzles, created, by, metrodorus, one, of, the, problems, sometimes, called, his, epitaph, states, here, lies, diophantus, the, wonder, behold, through, art, algebraic, the, stone, tells, how, old, god, gave, him, his, boyhood, one, sixth, of, his, life, one, twelfth, more, as, youth, while, whiskers, grew, rife, and, then, yet, one, seventh, ere, marriage, begun, in, five, years, there, came, a, bouncing, new, son, alas, the, dear, child, of, master, and, sage, after, attaining, half, the, measure, of, his, father, s, life, chill, fate, took, him, after, consoling, his, fate, by, the, science, of, numbers, for, four, years, he, ended, his, life, this, puzzle, implies, that, diophantus, age, x, can, be, expressed, as, which, gives, x, a, value, of, 84, years, however, the, accuracy, of, the, information, cannot, be, confirmed, in, popular, culture, this, puzzle, was, the, puzzle, no, 142, in, professor, layton, and, pandora, s, box, as, one, of, the, hardest, solving, puzzles, in, the, game, which, needed, to, be, unlocked, by, solving, other, puzzles, first, arithmetica, is, the, major, work, of, diophantus, and, the, most, prominent, work, on, premodern, algebra, in, greek, mathematics, it, is, a, collection, of, problems, giving, numerical, solutions, of, both, determinate, and, indeterminate, equations, of, the, original, thirteen, books, of, which, arithmetica, consisted, only, six, have, survived, though, there, are, some, who, believe, that, four, arabic, books, discovered, in, 1968, are, also, by, diophantus, some, diophantine, problems, from, arithmetica, have, been, found, in, arabic, sources, it, should, be, mentioned, here, that, diophantus, never, used, general, methods, in, his, solutions, hermann, hankel, renowned, german, mathematician, made, the, following, remark, regarding, diophantus, our, author, diophantos, not, the, slightest, trace, of, a, general, comprehensive, method, is, discernible, each, problem, calls, for, some, special, method, which, refuses, to, work, even, for, the, most, closely, related, problems, for, this, reason, it, is, difficult, for, the, modern, scholar, to, solve, the, 101st, problem, even, after, having, studied, 100, of, diophantos, s, solutions, like, many, other, greek, mathematical, treatises, diophantus, was, forgotten, in, western, europe, during, the, dark, ages, since, the, study, of, ancient, greek, and, literacy, in, general, had, greatly, declined, the, portion, of, the, greek, arithmetica, that, survived, however, was, like, all, ancient, greek, texts, transmitted, to, the, early, modern, world, copied, by, and, thus, known, to, medieval, byzantine, scholars, scholia, on, diophantus, by, the, byzantine, greek, scholar, john, chortasmenos, 1370, 1437, are, preserved, together, with, a, comprehensive, commentary, written, by, the, earlier, greek, scholar, maximos, planudes, 1260, 1305, who, produced, an, edition, of, diophantus, within, the, library, of, the, chora, monastery, in, byzantine, constantinople, in, addition, some, portion, of, the, arithmetica, probably, survived, in, the, arab, tradition, see, above, in, 1463, german, mathematician, regiomontanus, wrote, no, one, has, yet, translated, from, the, greek, into, latin, the, thirteen, books, of, diophantus, in, which, the, very, flower, of, the, whole, of, arithmetic, lies, hidden, arithmetica, was, first, translated, from, greek, into, latin, by, bombelli, in, 1570, but, the, translation, was, never, published, however, bombelli, borrowed, many, of, the, problems, for, his, own, book, algebra, the, editio, princeps, of, arithmetica, was, published, in, 1575, by, xylander, the, latin, translation, of, arithmetica, by, bachet, in, 1621, became, the, first, latin, edition, that, was, widely, available, pierre, de, fermat, owned, a, copy, studied, it, and, made, notes, in, the, margins, a, later, 1895, latin, translation, by, paul, tannery, was, said, to, be, an, improvement, by, thomas, l, heath, who, used, it, in, the, 1910, second, edition, of, his, english, translation, the, 1621, edition, of, arithmetica, by, bachet, gained, fame, after, pierre, de, fermat, wrote, his, famous, last, theorem, in, the, margins, of, his, copy, if, an, integer, n, is, greater, than, 2, then, a, n, b, n, c, n, has, no, solutions, in, non, zero, integers, a, b, and, c, i, have, a, truly, marvelous, proof, of, this, proposition, which, this, margin, is, too, narrow, to, contain, fermat, s, proof, was, never, found, and, the, problem, of, finding, a, proof, for, the, theorem, went, unsolved, for, centuries, a, proof, was, finally, found, in, 1994, by, andrew, wiles, after, working, on, it, for, seven, years, it, is, believed, that, fermat, did, not, actually, have, the, proof, he, claimed, to, have, although, the, original, copy, in, which, fermat, wrote, this, is, lost, today, fermat, s, son, edited, the, next, edition, of, diophantus, published, in, 1670, even, though, the, text, is, otherwise, inferior, to, the, 1621, edition, fermat, s, annotations, including, the, last, theorem, were, printed, in, this, version, fermat, was, not, the, first, mathematician, so, moved, to, write, in, his, own, marginal, notes, to, diophantus, the, byzantine, scholar, john, chortasmenos, 1370, 1437, had, written, thy, soul, diophantus, be, with, satan, because, of, the, difficulty, of, your, other, theorems, and, particularly, of, the, present, theorem, next, to, the, same, problem, diophantus, wrote, several, other, books, besides, arithmetica, but, only, a, few, of, them, have, survived, diophantus, himself, refers, to, a, work, which, consists, of, a, collection, of, lemmas, called, the, porisms, or, porismata, but, this, book, is, entirely, lost, although, the, porisms, is, lost, we, know, three, lemmas, contained, there, since, diophantus, refers, to, them, in, the, arithmetica, one, lemma, states, that, the, difference, of, the, cubes, of, two, rational, numbers, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, cubes, of, two, other, rational, numbers, i, e, given, any, a, and, b, with, a, b, there, exist, c, and, d, all, positive, and, rational, such, that, diophantus, is, also, known, to, have, written, on, polygonal, numbers, a, topic, of, great, interest, to, pythagoras, and, pythagoreans, fragments, of, a, book, dealing, with, polygonal, numbers, are, extant, a, book, called, preliminaries, to, the, geometric, elements, has, been, traditionally, attributed, to, hero, of, alexandria, it, has, been, studied, recently, by, wilbur, knorr, who, suggested, that, the, attribution, to, hero, is, incorrect, and, that, the, true, author, is, diophantus, diophantus, work, has, had, a, large, influence, in, history, editions, of, arithmetica, exerted, a, profound, influence, on, the, development, of, algebra, in, europe, in, the, late, sixteenth, and, through, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, diophantus, and, his, works, also, influenced, arab, mathematics, and, were, of, great, fame, among, arab, mathematicians, diophantus, work, created, a, foundation, for, work, on, algebra, and, in, fact, much, of, advanced, mathematics, is, based, on, algebra, how, much, he, affected, india, is, a, matter, of, debate, diophantus, has, been, considered, the, father, of, algebra, because, of, his, contributions, to, number, theory, mathematical, notations, and, the, earliest, known, use, of, syncopated, notation, in, his, book, series, arithmetica, however, this, is, usually, debated, because, al, khwarizmi, was, also, given, the, title, as, the, father, of, algebra, nevertheless, both, mathematicians, were, responsible, for, paving, the, way, for, algebra, today, today, diophantine, analysis, is, the, area, of, study, where, integer, whole, number, solutions, are, sought, for, equations, and, diophantine, equations, are, polynomial, equations, with, integer, coefficients, to, which, only, integer, solutions, are, sought, it, is, usually, rather, difficult, to, tell, whether, a, given, diophantine, equation, is, solvable, most, of, the, problems, in, arithmetica, lead, to, quadratic, equations, diophantus, looked, at, 3, different, types, of, quadratic, equations, ax, 2, bx, c, ax, 2, bx, c, and, ax, 2, c, bx, the, reason, why, there, were, three, cases, to, diophantus, while, today, we, have, only, one, case, is, that, he, did, not, have, any, notion, for, zero, and, he, avoided, negative, coefficients, by, considering, the, given, numbers, a, b, c, to, all, be, positive, in, each, of, the, three, cases, above, diophantus, was, always, satisfied, with, a, rational, solution, and, did, not, require, a, whole, number, which, means, he, accepted, fractions, as, solutions, to, his, problems, diophantus, considered, negative, or, irrational, square, root, solutions, useless, meaningless, and, even, absurd, to, give, one, specific, example, he, calls, the, equation, 4, 4, x, 20, absurd, because, it, would, lead, to, a, negative, value, for, x, one, solution, was, all, he, looked, for, in, a, quadratic, equation, there, is, no, evidence, that, suggests, diophantus, even, realized, that, there, could, be, two, solutions, to, a, quadratic, equation, he, also, considered, simultaneous, quadratic, equations, diophantus, made, important, advances, in, mathematical, notation, becoming, the, first, person, known, to, use, algebraic, notation, and, symbolism, before, him, everyone, wrote, out, equations, completely, diophantus, introduced, an, algebraic, symbolism, that, used, an, abridged, notation, for, frequently, occurring, operations, and, an, abbreviation, for, the, unknown, and, for, the, powers, of, the, unknown, mathematical, historian, kurt, vogel, states, the, symbolism, that, diophantus, introduced, for, the, first, time, and, undoubtedly, devised, himself, provided, a, short, and, readily, comprehensible, means, of, expressing, an, equation, since, an, abbreviation, is, also, employed, for, the, word, equals, diophantus, took, a, fundamental, step, from, verbal, algebra, towards, symbolic, algebra, although, diophantus, made, important, advances, in, symbolism, he, still, lacked, the, necessary, notation, to, express, more, general, methods, this, caused, his, work, to, be, more, concerned, with, particular, problems, rather, than, general, situations, some, of, the, limitations, of, diophantus, notation, are, that, he, only, had, notation, for, one, unknown, and, when, problems, involved, more, than, a, single, unknown, diophantus, was, reduced, to, expressing, first, unknown, second, unknown, etc, in, words, he, also, lacked, a, symbol, for, a, general, number, n, where, we, would, write, 12, 6, n, n, 2, 3, diophantus, has, to, resort, to, constructions, like, a, sixfold, number, increased, by, twelve, which, is, divided, by, the, difference, by, which, the, square, of, the, number, exceeds, three, algebra, still, had, a, long, way, to, go, before, very, general, problems, could, be, written, down, and, solved, succinctly, but, what, we, really, want, to, know, is, to, what, extent, the, alexandrian, mathematicians, of, the, period, from, the, first, to, the, fifth, centuries, c, e, were, greek, certainly, all, of, them, wrote, in, greek, and, were, part, of, the, greek, intellectual, community, of, alexandria, and, most, modern, studies, conclude, that, the, greek, community, coexisted, so, should, we, assume, that, ptolemy, and, diophantus, pappus, and, hypatia, were, ethnically, greek, that, their, ancestors, had, come, from, greece, at, some, point, in, the, past, but, had, remained, effectively, isolated, from, the, egyptians, it, is, of, course, impossible, to, answer, this, question, definitively, but, research, in, papyri, dating, from, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, demonstrates, that, a, significant, amount, of, intermarriage, took, place, between, the, greek, and, egyptian, communities, and, it, is, known, that, greek, marriage, contracts, increasingly, came, to, resemble, egyptian, ones, in, addition, even, from, the, founding, of, alexandria, small, numbers, of, egyptians, were, admitted, to, the, privileged, classes, in, the, city, to, fulfill, numerous, civic, roles, of, course, it, was, essential, in, such, cases, for, the, egyptians, to, become, hellenized, to, adopt, greek, habits, and, the, greek, language, given, that, the, alexandrian, mathematicians, mentioned, here, were, active, several, hundred, years, after, the, founding, of, the, city, it, would, seem, at, least, equally, possible, that, they, were, ethnically, egyptian, as, that, they, remained, ethnically, greek, in, any, case, it, is, unreasonable, to, portray, them, with, purely, european, features, when, no, physical, descriptions, exist, diophantos, was, most, likely, a, hellenized, babylonian
