little, above, average, in, height, with, bright, dark, eyes, and, dark, brown, hair, his, good, appearance, said, historian, neill, macaulay, owed, much, to, his, bearing, proud, and, erect, even,

unacceptable, demands, the, mutiny, was, a, thinly, veiled, military, coup, d, tat, that, sought, to, turn, pedro, into, a, mere, figurehead, and, transfer, power, to, avilez, the, prince, accepted, the, unsatisfactory, outcome, but, he, also, warned, that, it, was, the, last, time, he, would, yield, under, pressure, the, continuing, crisis, reached, a, point, of, no, return, when, the, cortes, dissolved, the, central, government, in, rio, de, janeiro, and, ordered, pedro, s, return, this, was, perceived, by, brazilians, as, an, attempt, to, subordinate, their, country, again, to, portugal,

only, surrendered, in, early, 1824, meanwhile, pedro, i, s, relationship, with, bonif, cio, deteriorated, the, situation, came, to, a, head, when, pedro, i, on, the, grounds, of, inappropriate, conduct, dismissed, bonif, cio, bonif, cio, had, used, his, position, to, harass, prosecute, arrest, and, even, exile, his, political, enemies, for, months, bonif, cio, s, enemies, had, worked, to,

immediately, within, the, constituent, and, legislative, general, assembly, which, had, been, elected, for, the, purpose, of, drafting, a, constitution, a, member, of, the, constituent, assembly, bonif, cio, resorted, to, demagoguery, alleging, the, existence, of, a, major, portuguese, conspiracy, against, brazilian, interests, insinuating, that, pedro, i, who, had, been, born, in, portugal, was, implicated, the, emperor, became, outraged, by, the, invective, directed, at, the, loyalty, of, citizens, who, were, of, portuguese, birth, and, the, hints, that, he, was, himself, conflicted, in, his, allegiance, to, brazil, on, 12, november, 1823, pedro, i, ordered, the, dissolution, of, the, constituent, assembly, and, called, for, new, elections, on, the, following, day, he, placed, a,

favor, of, its, instant, adoption, as, the, constitution, of, the, empire, as, a, result, of, the, highly, centralized, state, created, by, the, constitution, rebellious, elements, in, cear, para, ba, and, pernambuco, attempted, to, secede, from, brazil, and, unite, in, what, became, known, as, the, confederation, of, the, equator, pedro, i, unsuccessfully, sought, to, avoid, bloodshed, by, offering, to, placate, the, rebels, angry, he, said, what, did, the, insults, from, pernambuco, require, surely, a, punishment, and, such, a, punishment, that, it, will, serve, as, an, example, for, the, future, the, rebels, were, never, able, to, secure, control, over, their, provinces, and, were, easily, suppressed, by, late, 1824, the, rebellion, was, over, sixteen, rebels, were, tried, and,

other, requirements, of, portugal, compensation, was, to, be, paid, to, all, portuguese, citizens, residing, in, brazil, for, the, losses, they, had, experienced, such, as, properties, which, had, been, confiscated, john, vi, was, also, given, the, right, to, style, himself, emperor, of, brazil, more, humiliating, was, that, the, treaty, implied, that, independence, had, been, granted, as, a, beneficent, act, of, john, vi, rather, than, having, been, compelled, by, the, brazilians, through, force, of, arms, even, worse, great, britain, was, rewarded, for, its, role, in, advancing, the, negotiations, by, the, signing, of, a, separate, treaty, in, which, its, favorable, commercial, rights, were, renewed, and, by, the, signing, of, a, convention, in, which, brazil, agreed, to, abolish, slave, trade, with, africa, within, four, years, both, accords, were, severely, harmful, to, brazilian, economic, interests, a, few, months, later, the, emperor, received, word, that, his, father, had, died, on, 10, march, 1826, and, that, he, had, succeeded, his, father, on, the, portuguese, throne, as, king, dom, pedro, iv, aware, that, a, reunion, of, brazil, and, portugal, would, be,

pedro, i, continued, to, act, as, an, absentee, king, of, portugal, and, interceded, in, its, diplomatic, matters, as, well, as, in, internal, affairs, such, as, making, appointments, he, found, it, difficult, at, the, very, least, to, keep, his, position, as, brazilian, emperor, separate, from, his, obligations, to, protect, his, daughter, s, interests, in, portugal, miguel, feigned, compliance, with, pedro, i, s, plans, as, soon, as, he, was, declared, regent, in, early, 1828, and, backed, by, carlota, joaquina, he, abrogated, the, constitution, and, supported, by, those, portuguese, in, favor, of, absolutism, was, acclaimed, king, dom, miguel, i, as, painful, as, was, his, beloved, brother, s, betrayal, pedro, i, also, endured, the, defection, of, his, surviving, sisters, maria, teresa, maria, francisca, isabel, maria, and, maria, da, assun, o, to, miguel, i, s, faction, only, his, youngest, sister, ana, de, jesus, remained, faithful, to, him, and, she, later, traveled, to, rio, de, janeiro, to, be, close, to, him, consumed, by, hatred, and, beginning, to, believe, rumors, that, miguel, i, had, murdered, their, father, pedro, i, turned, his, focus, on, portugal, and, tried, in, vain, to, garner, international, support, for, maria, ii, s, rights, backed, by, the, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, present, day, argentina, a, small, band, declared, brazil, s, southernmost, province, of, cisplatina, to, be, independent, in, april, 1825, the, brazilian, government, at, first, perceived, the, secession, attempt, as, a, minor, uprising, it, took, months, before, a, greater, threat, posed, by, the, involvement, of, the, united, provinces, which, expected, to, annex, cisplatina, caused, serious, concern, in, retaliation, the, empire, declared, war, in, december, triggering, the, cisplatine, war, the, emperor, traveled, to, bahia, province, located, in, northeastern, brazil, in, february, 1826, taking, along, his, wife, and, daughter, maria,

then, viscountess, and, later, marchioness, of, santos, who, had, been, pedro, i, s, mistress, since, their, first, meeting, in, 1822, although, he, had, never, been, faithful, to, maria, leopoldina, he, had, previously, been, careful, to, conceal, his, sexual, escapades, with, other, women, however, his, infatuation, for, his, new, lover, had, become, both, blatant, and, limitless, while, his, wife, endured, slights, and, became, the, object, of, gossip, pedro, i, was, increasingly, rude, and, mean, toward, maria, leopoldina, left, her, short, of, funds, prohibited, her, from, leaving, the, palace, and, forced, her, to, endure, domitila, s, presence, as, her, lady, in, waiting, in, the, meantime, his, lover, took, advantage, by, advancing, her, interests, as, well, as, those, of, her, family, and, friends, those, seeking, favors, or, to, promote, projects, increasingly, sought, her, help, bypassing, the, normal, legal, channels, on, 24, november, 1826, pedro, i, sailed, from, rio, de, janeiro, to, s, o, jos, in, the, province, of, santa, catarina, from, there, he, rode, to, porto, alegre, capital, of, the, province, of, rio, grande, do, sul, where, the, main, army, was, stationed, upon, his, arrival, on, 7, december, the, emperor, found, the, military, conditions, to, be, much, worse, than, previous, reports, had, led, him, to, expect, he, reacted, with, his, customary, energy, he, passed, a, flurry, of, orders, fired, reputed, grafters, and, incompetents, fraternized, with, the, troops, and, generally, shook, up, military, and, civilian, administration, he, was, already, on, his, way, back, to, rio, de, janeiro, when, he, was, told, that, maria, leopoldina, had, died, following, a, miscarriage, unfounded, rumors, soon, spread, that, purported, that, she, had, died, after, being, physically, assaulted, by, pedro, i, meanwhile, the, war, continued, on, with, no, conclusion, in, sight, pedro, i, relinquished, cisplatina, in, august, 1828, and, the, province, became, the, independent, nation, of, uruguay, after, his, wife, s, death, pedro, i, realized, how, miserably, he, had, treated, her, and, his, relationship, with, domitila, began, to, crumble, maria, leopoldina, unlike, his, mistress, was, popular, honest, and, loved, him, without, expecting, anything, in, return, the, emperor, greatly, missed, her, and, even, his, obsession, with, domitila, failed, to, overcome, his, sense, of, loss, and, regret, one, day, domitila, found, him, weeping, on, the, floor, and, embracing, a, portrait, of, his, deceased, wife, whose, sad, looking, ghost, pedro, i, claimed, to, have, seen, later, on, the, emperor, left, the, bed, he, shared, with, domitila, and, shouted, get, off, of, me, i, know, i, live, an, unworthy, life, of, a, sovereign, the, thought, of, the, empress, does, not, leave, me, he, did, not, forget, his, children, orphaned, of, their, mother, and, was, observed, on, more, than, one, occasion, holding, his, son, the, young, pedro, in, his, arms, and, saying, poor, boy, you, are, the, most, unhappy, prince, in, the, world, at, the, insistence, of, pedro, i, domitila, departed, from, rio, de, janeiro, on, 27, june, 1828, he, had, resolved, to, marry, again, and, to, become, a, better, person, he, even, tried, to, persuade, his, father, in, law, of, his, sincerity, by, claiming, in, a, letter, that, all, my, wickedness, is, over, that, i, shall, not, again, fall, into, those, errors, into, which, i, have, fallen, which, i, regret, and, have, asked, god, for, forgiveness, francis, i, was, less, than, convinced, the, austrian, emperor, deeply, offended, by, the, conduct, his, daughter, endured, withdrew, his, support, for, brazilian, concerns, and, frustrated, pedro, i, s, portuguese, interests, because, of, pedro, i, s, bad, reputation, in, europe, owing, to, his, past, behavior, princesses, from, several, nations, declined, his, proposals, of, marriage, one, after, another, his, pride, thus, wounded, he, allowed, his, mistress, to, return, which, she, did, on, 29, april, 1829, after, having, been, away, nearly, a, year, however, once, he, learned, that, a, betrothal, had, finally, been, arranged, the, emperor, ended, his, relationship, to, domitila, she, returned, to, her, native, province, of, s, o, paulo, on, 27, august, where, she, remained, days, earlier, on, 2, august, the, emperor, had, been, married, by, proxy, to, am, lie, of, leuchtenberg, he, was, stunned, by, her, beauty, after, meeting, her, in, person, the, vows, previously, made, by, proxy, were, ratified, in, a, nuptial, mass, on, 17, october, am, lie, was, kind, and, loving, to, his, children, and, provided, a, much, needed, sense, of, normality, to, both, his, family, and, the, general, public, after, domitila, s, banishment, from, court, the, vow, the, emperor, made, to, alter, his, behavior, proved, to, be, sincere, he, had, no, more, affairs, and, remained, faithful, to, his, spouse, in, an, attempt, to, mitigate, and, move, beyond, other, past, misdeeds, he, made, peace, with, jos, bonif, cio, his, former, minister, and, mentor, since, the, days, of, the, constituent, assembly, in, 1823, and, with, renewed, vigor, in, 1826, with, the, opening, of, the, general, assembly, the, brazilian, parliament, there, had, been, an, ideological, struggle, over, the, balance, of, powers, wielded, by, the, emperor, and, legislature, in, governance, on, one, side, were, those, who, shared, pedro, i, s, views, politicians, who, believed, that, the, monarch, should, be, free, to, choose, ministers, national, policies, and, the, direction, of, government, in, opposition, were, those, then, known, as, the, liberal, party, who, believed, that, cabinets, should, have, the, power, to, set, the, government, s, course, and, should, consist, of, deputies, drawn, from, the, majority, party, who, were, accountable, to, the, parliament, strictly, speaking, both, the, party, that, supported, pedro, i, s, government, and, the, liberal, party, advocated, liberalism, and, thus, constitutional, monarchy, regardless, of, pedro, i, s, failures, as, a, ruler, he, respected, the, constitution, he, did, not, tamper, with, elections, or, countenance, vote, rigging, refuse, to, sign, acts, ratified, by, the, government, or, impose, any, restrictions, on, freedom, of, speech, although, within, his, prerogative, he, did, not, dissolve, the, chamber, of, deputies, and, call, for, new, elections, when, it, disagreed, with, his, aims, or, postpone, seating, the, legislature, liberal, newspapers, and, pamphlets, seized, on, pedro, i, s, portuguese, birth, in, support, of, both, valid, accusations, e, g, that, much, of, his, energy, was, directed, toward, affairs, concerning, portugal, and, false, charges, e, g, that, he, was, involved, in, plots, to, suppress, the, constitution, and, to, reunite, brazil, and, portugal, to, the, liberals, the, emperor, s, portuguese, born, friends, who, were, part, of, the, imperial, court, including, francisco, gomes, da, silva, who, was, nicknamed, the, buffoon, were, part, of, these, conspiracies, and, formed, a, secret, cabinet, none, of, these, figures, exhibited, interest, in, such, issues, and, whatever, interests, they, may, have, shared, there, was, no, palace, cabal, plotting, to, abrogate, the, constitution, or, to, bring, brazil, back, under, portugal, s, control, another, source, of, criticism, by, the, liberals, involved, pedro, i, s, abolitionist, views, the, emperor, had, indeed, conceived, a, gradual, process, for, eliminating, slavery, however, the, constitutional, power, to, enact, legislation, was, in, the, hands, of, the, assembly, which, was, dominated, by, slave, owning, landholders, who, could, thus, thwart, any, attempt, at, abolition, the, emperor, opted, to, try, persuasion, by, moral, example, setting, up, his, estate, at, santa, cruz, as, a, model, by, granting, land, to, his, freed, slaves, there, pedro, i, also, professed, other, advanced, ideas, when, he, declared, his, intention, to, remain, in, brazil, on, 9, january, 1822, and, the, populace, sought, to, accord, him, the, honor, of, unhitching, the, horses, and, pulling, his, carriage, themselves, the, then, prince, regent, refused, his, reply, was, a, simultaneous, denunciation, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, of, nobility, s, supposedly, superior, blood, and, of, racism, it, grieves, me, to, see, my, fellow, humans, giving, a, man, tributes, appropriate, for, the, divinity, i, know, that, my, blood, is, the, same, color, as, that, of, the, negroes, the, emperor, s, efforts, to, appease, the, liberal, party, resulted, in, very, important, changes, he, supported, an, 1827, law, that, established, ministerial, responsibility, on, 19, march, 1831, he, named, a, cabinet, formed, by, politicians, drawn, from, the, opposition, allowing, a, greater, role, for, the, parliament, in, the, government, lastly, he, offered, positions, in, europe, to, francisco, gomes, and, another, portuguese, born, friend, to, extinguish, rumors, of, a, secret, cabinet, to, his, dismay, his, palliative, measures, did, not, stop, the, continuous, attacks, from, the, liberal, side, upon, his, government, and, his, foreign, birth, frustrated, by, their, intransigence, he, became, unwilling, to, deal, with, his, deteriorating, political, situation, meanwhile, portuguese, exiles, campaigned, to, convince, him, to, give, up, on, brazil, and, instead, devote, his, energies, to, the, fight, for, his, daughter, s, claim, to, portugal, s, crown, according, to, roderick, j, barman, an, emergency, the, emperor, s, abilities, shone, forth, he, became, cool, in, nerve, resourceful, and, steadfast, in, action, life, as, a, constitutional, monarch, full, of, tedium, caution, and, conciliation, ran, against, the, essence, of, his, character, on, the, other, hand, the, historian, remarked, he, found, in, his, daughter, s, case, everything, that, appealed, most, to, his, character, by, going, to, portugal, he, could, champion, the, oppressed, display, his, chivalry, and, self, denial, uphold, constitutional, rule, and, enjoy, the, freedom, of, action, he, craved, the, idea, of, abdicating, and, returning, to, portugal, took, root, in, his, mind, and, beginning, in, early, 1829, he, talked, about, it, frequently, an, opportunity, soon, appeared, to, act, upon, the, notion, radicals, within, the, liberal, party, rallied, street, gangs, to, harass, the, portuguese, community, in, rio, de, janeiro, on, 11, march, 1831, in, what, became, known, as, the, night, of, the, bottle, fight, portuguese, noite, das, garrafadas, the, portuguese, retaliated, and, turmoil, gripped, the, streets, of, the, national, capital, on, 5, april, pedro, i, fired, the, liberal, cabinet, which, had, only, been, in, power, since, 19, march, for, its, incompetence, in, restoring, order, a, large, crowd, incited, by, the, radicals, gathered, in, rio, de, janeiro, downtown, on, the, afternoon, of, 6, april, and, demanded, the, immediate, restoration, of, the, fallen, cabinet, the, emperor, s, reply, was, i, will, do, everything, for, the, people, and, nothing, by, the, people, sometime, after, nightfall, army, troops, including, his, guard, deserted, him, and, joined, the, protests, only, then, did, he, realize, how, isolated, and, detached, from, brazilian, affairs, he, had, become, and, to, everyone, s, surprise, he, abdicated, at, approximately, 03, 00, on, 7, april, upon, delivering, the, abdication, document, to, a, messenger, he, said, here, you, have, my, act, of, abdication, i, m, returning, to, europe, and, leaving, a, country, that, i, loved, very, much, and, still, love, at, dawn, on, the, morning, of, 7, april, pedro, his, wife, and, others, including, his, daughter, maria, ii, and, his, sister, ana, de, jesus, were, taken, on, board, the, british, warship, hms, warspite, the, vessel, remained, at, anchor, off, rio, de, janeiro, and, on, 13, april, the, former, emperor, transferred, to, and, departed, for, europe, aboard, hms, volage, he, arrived, in, cherbourg, octeville, france, on, 10, june, during, the, next, few, months, he, shuttled, between, france, and, great, britain, he, was, warmly, welcomed, but, received, no, actual, support, from, either, government, to, restore, his, daughter, s, throne, finding, himself, in, an, awkward, situation, because, he, held, no, official, status, in, either, the, brazilian, imperial, house, or, in, the, portuguese, royal, house, pedro, assumed, the, title, of, duke, of, braganza, on, 15, june, a, position, that, once, had, been, his, as, heir, apparent, to, portugal, s, crown, although, the, title, should, have, belonged, to, maria, ii, s, heir, apparent, which, he, certainly, was, not, his, claim, was, met, with, general, recognition, on, 1, december, his, only, daughter, by, am, lie, maria, am, lia, was, born, in, paris, he, did, not, forget, his, children, left, in, brazil, he, wrote, poignant, letters, to, each, of, them, conveying, how, greatly, he, missed, them, and, repeatedly, asking, them, to, seriously, attend, to, their, educations, shortly, before, his, abdication, pedro, had, told, his, son, and, successor, i, intend, that, my, brother, miguel, and, i, will, be, the, last, badly, educated, of, the, braganza, family, charles, napier, a, naval, commander, who, fought, under, pedro, s, banner, in, the, 1830s, remarked, that, his, good, qualities, were, his, own, his, bad, owing, to, want, of, education, and, no, man, was, more, sensible, of, that, defect, than, himself, his, letters, to, pedro, ii, were, often, couched, in, language, beyond, the, boy, s, reading, level, and, historians, have, assumed, such, passages, were, chiefly, intended, as, advice, that, the, young, monarch, might, eventually, consult, upon, reaching, adulthood, while, in, paris, the, duke, of, braganza, met, and, befriended, gilbert, du, motier, marquis, of, lafayette, a, veteran, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, who, became, one, of, his, staunchest, supporters, with, limited, funds, pedro, organized, a, small, army, composed, of, portuguese, liberals, like, almeida, garrett, and, alexandre, herculano, foreign, mercenaries, and, volunteers, such, as, lafayette, s, grandson, adrien, jules, de, lasteyrie, on, 25, january, 1832, pedro, bade, farewell, to, his, family, lafayette, and, around, two, hundred, well, wishers, he, knelt, before, maria, ii, and, said, my, lady, here, is, a, portuguese, general, who, will, uphold, your, rights, and, restore, your, crown, in, tears, his, daughter, embraced, him, pedro, and, his, army, sailed, to, the, atlantic, archipelago, of, the, azores, the, only, portuguese, territory, that, had, remained, loyal, to, his, daughter, after, a, few, months, of, final, preparations, they, embarked, for, mainland, portugal, entering, the, city, of, porto, unopposed, on, 9, july, his, brother, s, troops, moved, to, encircle, the, city, beginning, a, siege, that, lasted, for, more, than, a, year, in, early, 1833, while, besieged, in, porto, pedro, received, news, from, brazil, of, his, daughter, paula, s, impending, death, months, later, in, september, he, met, with, ant, nio, carlos, de, andrada, a, brother, of, bonif, cio, who, had, come, from, brazil, as, a, representative, of, the, restorationist, party, ant, nio, carlos, asked, the, duke, of, braganza, to, return, to, brazil, and, rule, his, former, empire, as, regent, during, his, son, s, minority, pedro, realized, that, the, restorationists, wanted, to, use, him, as, a, tool, to, facilitate, their, own, rise, to, power, and, frustrated, ant, nio, carlos, by, making, several, demands, to, ascertain, whether, the, brazilian, people, and, not, merely, a, faction, truly, wanted, him, back, he, insisted, that, any, request, to, return, as, regent, be, constitutionally, valid, the, people, s, will, would, have, to, be, conveyed, through, their, local, representatives, and, his, appointment, approved, by, the, general, assembly, only, then, and, upon, the, presentation, of, a, petition, to, him, in, portugal, by, an, official, delegation, of, the, brazilian, parliament, would, he, consider, accepting, during, the, war, the, duke, of, braganza, mounted, cannons, dug, trenches, tended, the, wounded, ate, among, the, rank, and, file, and, fought, under, heavy, fire, as, men, next, to, him, were, shot, or, blown, to, pieces, his, cause, was, nearly, lost, until, he, took, the, risky, step, of, dividing, his, forces, and, sending, a, portion, to, launch, an, amphibious, attack, on, southern, portugal, the, algarve, region, fell, to, the, expedition, which, then, marched, north, straight, for, lisbon, which, capitulated, on, 24, july, pedro, proceeded, to, subdue, the, remainder, of, the, country, but, just, when, the, conflict, looked, to, be, winding, down, to, a, conclusion, his, spanish, uncle, don, carlos, who, was, attempting, to, seize, the, crown, of, his, niece, do, a, isabella, ii, intervened, in, this, wider, conflict, that, engulfed, the, entire, iberian, peninsula, the, first, carlist, war, the, duke, of, braganza, allied, with, liberal, spanish, armies, loyal, to, isabella, ii, and, defeated, both, miguel, i, and, carlos, a, peace, accord, was, reached, on, 26, may, 1834, except, for, bouts, of, epilepsy, that, manifested, in, seizures, every, few, years, pedro, had, always, enjoyed, robust, health, the, war, however, undermined, his, constitution, and, by, 1834, he, was, dying, of, tuberculosis, he, was, confined, to, his, bed, in, queluz, royal, palace, from, 10, september, pedro, dictated, an, open, letter, to, the, brazilians, in, which, he, begged, that, a, gradual, abolition, of, slavery, be, adopted, he, warned, them, slavery, is, an, evil, and, an, attack, against, the, rights, and, dignity, of, the, human, species, but, its, consequences, are, less, harmful, to, those, who, suffer, in, captivity, than, to, the, nation, whose, laws, allow, slavery, it, is, a, cancer, that, devours, its, morality, after, a, long, and, painful, illness, pedro, died, at, 14, 30, on, 24, september, 1834, as, he, had, requested, his, heart, was, placed, in, porto, s, lapa, church, and, his, body, was, interred, in, the, royal, pantheon, of, the, house, of, braganza, the, news, of, his, death, arrived, in, rio, de, janeiro, on, 20, november, but, his, children, were, informed, only, after, 2, december, bonif, cio, who, had, been, removed, from, his, position, as, their, guardian, wrote, to, pedro, ii, and, his, sisters, dom, pedro, did, not, die, only, ordinary, men, die, not, heroes, upon, the, death, of, pedro, i, the, then, powerful, restorationist, party, vanished, overnight, a, fair, assessment, of, the, former, monarch, became, possible, once, the, threat, of, his, return, to, power, was, removed, evaristo, da, veiga, one, of, his, worst, critics, as, well, as, a, leader, in, the, liberal, party, left, a, statement, which, according, to, historian, oct, vio, tarqu, nio, de, sousa, became, the, prevailing, view, thereafter, the, former, emperor, of, brazil, was, not, a, prince, of, ordinary, measure, and, providence, has, made, him, a, powerful, instrument, of, liberation, both, in, brazil, and, in, portugal, if, we, exist, as, a, body, in, a, free, nation, if, our, land, was, not, ripped, apart, into, small, enemy, republics, where, only, anarchy, and, military, spirit, predominated, we, owe, much, to, the, resolution, he, took, in, remaining, among, us, in, making, the, first, shout, for, our, independence, he, continued, portugal, if, it, was, freed, from, the, darkest, and, demeaning, tyranny, if, it, enjoys, the, benefits, brought, by, representative, government, to, learned, peoples, it, owes, it, to, d, pedro, de, alc, ntara, whose, fatigues, sufferings, and, sacrifices, for, the, portuguese, cause, has, earned, him, in, high, degree, the, tribute, of, national, gratitude, john, armitage, who, lived, in, brazil, during, the, latter, half, of, pedro, i, s, reign, remarked, that, even, the, errors, of, the, monarch, have, been, attended, with, great, benefit, through, their, influence, on, the, affairs, of, the, mother, country, had, he, governed, with, more, wisdom, it, would, have, been, well, for, the, land, of, his, adoption, yet, perhaps, unfortunate, for, humanity, armitage, added, that, like, the, late, emperor, of, the, french, he, was, also, a, child, of, destiny, or, rather, an, instrument, in, the, hands, of, an, all, seeing, and, beneficent, providence, for, the, furtherance, of, great, and, inscrutable, ends, in, the, old, as, in, the, new, world, he, was, henceforth, fated, to, become, the, instrument, of, further, revolutions, and, ere, the, close, of, his, brilliant, but, ephemeral, career, in, the, land, of, his, fathers, to, atone, amply, for, the, errors, and, follies, of, his, former, life, by, his, chivalrous, and, heroic, devotion, in, the, cause, of, civil, and, religious, freedom, in, 1972, on, the, 150th, anniversary, of, brazilian, independence, pedro, i, s, remains, though, not, his, heart, were, brought, to, brazil, as, he, had, requested, in, his, will, accompanied, by, much, fanfare, and, with, honors, due, to, a, head, of, state, his, remains, were, reinterred, in, the, monument, to, the, independence, of, brazil, along, with, those, of, maria, leopoldina, and, am, lie, in, the, city, of, s, o, paulo, years, later, neill, macaulay, said, that, riticism, of, dom, pedro, was, freely, expressed, and, often, vehement, it, prompted, him, to, abdicate, two, thrones, his, tolerance, of, public, criticism, and, his, willingness, to, relinquish, power, set, dom, pedro, apart, from, his, absolutist, predecessors, and, from, the, rulers, of, today, s, coercive, states, whose, lifetime, tenure, is, as, secure, as, that, of, the, kings, of, old, macaulay, affirmed, that, uccessful, liberal, leaders, like, dom, pedro, may, be, honored, with, an, occasional, stone, or, bronze, monument, but, their, portraits, four, stories, high, do, not, shape, public, buildings, their, pictures, are, not, borne, in, parades, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, uniformed, marchers, no, isms, attach, to, their, names, as, part, of, brazil, s, 200, year, independence, celebrations, in, 2022, the, embalmed, heart, of, pedro, i, received, military, honors,
