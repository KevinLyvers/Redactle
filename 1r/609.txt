as, a, favor, to, his, friend, john, lasseter, miyazaki, also, expressed, his, opinion, about, the, terrorist, attack, at, the, offices, of, the, french, satirical, magazine, charlie, hebdo, criticizing, the, magazine, s, decision, to, publish, the, content, cited, as, the, catalyst, for, the, incident, he, felt, caricatures, should, be, made, of, politicians, not, cultures, in, november, 2016, miyazaki, believed, many, of, the, people, who, voted, for, brexit, and, trump, were, affected, by, the, increase, in, unemployment, due, to, companies, building, cars, in, mexico, because, of, low, wages, and, them, in, the, us, he, did, not, think, donald, trump, would, be, elected, president, calling, it, a, terrible, thing, but, said, trump, s, political, opponent, hillary, clinton, was, terrible, as, well, miyazaki, s, works, are, characterized, by, the, recurrence, of, themes, such, as, feminism, environmentalism, pacifism, love, and, family, his, narratives, are, also, notable, for, not, pitting, a, hero, against, an, unsympathetic, antagonist, miyazaki, felt, spirited, away, s, chihiro, manages, not, because, she, has, destroyed, the, evil, but, because, she, has, acquired, the, ability, to, survive, miyazaki, s, films, often, emphasize, environmentalism, and, the, earth, s, fragility, margaret, talbot, stated, miyazaki, dislikes, modern, technology, and, believes, much, of, modern, culture, is, thin, and, shallow, and, fake, he, anticipates, a, time, with, no, more, high, rises, miyazaki, felt, frustrated, growing, up, in, the, sh, wa, period, from, 1955, to, 1965, because, nature, the, mountains, and, rivers, was, being, destroyed, in, the, name, of, economic, progress, peter, schellhase, of, the, imaginative, conservative, identified, that, several, antagonists, of, miyazaki, s, films, attempt, to, dominate, nature, in, pursuit, of, political, domination, and, are, ultimately, destructive, to, both, nature, and, human, civilization, miyazaki, is, critical, of, exploitation, under, both, communism, and, capitalism, as, well, as, globalization, and, its, effects, on, modern, life, believing, a, company, is, common, property, of, the, people, that, work, there, ram, prakash, dwivedi, identified, values, of, mahatma, gandhi, in, the, films, of, miyazaki, several, of, miyazaki, s, films, feature, anti, war, themes, daisuke, akimoto, of, animation, studies, categorized, porco, rosso, as, anti, war, propaganda, and, felt, the, protagonist, porco, transforms, into, a, pig, partly, due, to, his, extreme, distaste, of, militarism, akimoto, also, argues, that, the, wind, rises, reflects, miyazaki, s, antiwar, pacifism, despite, miyazaki, stating, that, the, film, does, not, attempt, to, denounce, war, schellhase, also, identifies, princess, mononoke, as, a, pacifist, film, due, to, the, protagonist, ashitaka, instead, of, joining, the, campaign, of, revenge, against, humankind, as, his, ethnic, history, would, lead, him, to, do, ashitaka, strives, for, peace, david, loy, and, linda, goodhew, argue, both, nausica, of, the, valley, of, the, wind, and, princess, mononoke, do, not, depict, traditional, evil, but, the, buddhist, roots, of, evil, greed, ill, will, and, delusion, according, to, buddhism, the, roots, of, evil, must, transform, into, generosity, loving, kindness, and, wisdom, in, order, to, overcome, suffering, and, both, nausica, and, ashitaka, accomplish, this, when, characters, in, miyazaki, s, films, are, forced, to, engage, in, violence, it, is, shown, as, being, a, difficult, task, in, howl, s, moving, castle, howl, is, forced, to, fight, an, inescapable, battle, in, defense, of, those, he, loves, and, it, almost, destroys, him, though, he, is, ultimately, saved, by, sophie, s, love, and, bravery, suzuki, described, miyazaki, as, a, feminist, in, reference, to, his, attitude, to, female, workers, miyazaki, has, described, his, female, characters, as, brave, self, sufficient, girls, that, don, t, think, twice, about, fighting, for, what, they, believe, in, with, all, their, heart, stating, they, may, need, a, friend, or, a, supporter, but, never, a, saviour, and, any, woman, is, just, as, capable, of, being, a, hero, as, any, man, nausica, of, the, valley, of, the, wind, was, lauded, for, its, positive, portrayal, of, women, particularly, protagonist, nausica, schellhase, noted, the, female, characters, in, miyazaki, s, films, are, not, objectified, or, sexualized, and, possess, complex, and, individual, characteristics, absent, from, hollywood, productions, schellhase, also, identified, a, coming, of, age, element, for, the, heroines, in, miyazaki, s, films, as, they, each, discover, individual, personality, and, strengths, gabrielle, bellot, of, the, atlantic, wrote, that, in, his, films, miyazaki, shows, a, keen, understanding, of, the, complexities, of, what, it, might, mean, to, be, a, woman, in, particular, bellot, cites, nausica, of, the, valley, of, the, wind, praising, the, film, s, challenging, of, gender, expectations, and, the, strong, and, independent, nature, of, nausica, bellot, also, noted, princess, mononoke, s, san, represents, the, conflict, between, selfhood, and, expression, miyazaki, is, concerned, with, the, sense, of, wonder, in, young, people, seeking, to, maintain, themes, of, love, and, family, in, his, films, michael, toscano, of, curator, found, miyazaki, fears, japanese, children, are, dimmed, by, a, culture, of, overconsumption, overprotection, utilitarian, education, careerism, techno, industrialism, and, a, secularism, that, is, swallowing, japan, s, native, animism, schellhase, wrote, that, several, of, miyazaki, s, works, feature, themes, of, love, and, romance, but, felt, emphasis, is, placed, on, the, way, lonely, and, vulnerable, individuals, are, integrated, into, relationships, of, mutual, reliance, and, responsibility, which, generally, benefit, everyone, around, them, he, also, found, many, of, the, protagonists, in, miyazaki, s, films, present, an, idealized, image, of, families, whereas, others, are, dysfunctional, miyazaki, forgoes, traditional, screenplays, in, his, productions, instead, developing, the, narrative, as, he, designs, the, storyboards, stating, we, never, know, where, the, story, will, go, but, we, just, keep, working, on, the, film, as, it, develops, miyazaki, has, employed, traditional, animation, methods, in, all, of, his, films, drawing, each, frame, by, hand, computer, generated, imagery, has, been, employed, in, several, of, his, later, films, beginning, with, princess, mononoke, to, enrich, the, visual, look, though, he, ensures, each, film, can, retain, the, right, ratio, between, working, by, hand, and, computer, and, still, be, able, to, call, my, films, 2d, he, oversees, every, frame, of, his, films, for, character, designs, miyazaki, draws, original, drafts, used, by, animation, directors, to, create, reference, sheets, which, are, then, corrected, by, miyazaki, in, his, style, miyazaki, has, cited, several, japanese, artists, as, his, influences, including, sanpei, shirato, osamu, tezuka, soji, yamakawa, and, isao, takahata, and, western, artists, and, animators, like, fr, d, ric, back, jean, giraud, paul, grimault, yuri, norstein, and, animation, studio, aardman, animations,

queen, is, said, to, be, the, true, catalyst, for, miyazaki, s, filmography, influencing, his, training, and, work, when, animating, young, children, miyazaki, often, takes, inspiration, from, his, friends, children, and, memories, of, his, own, childhood, miyazaki, s, wife, akemi, ta, was, born, in, 1938, and, hired, as, an, inbetween, artist, at, toei, animation, in, 1958, working, on, panda,
