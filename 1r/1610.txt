robert, hooke, frs, h, k, 18, july, 1635, 3, march, 1703, was, an, english, polymath, who, was, active, as, a, physicist, natural, philosopher, astronomer, geologist, meteorologist, and, architect, he, is, credited, as, one, of, the, first, scientists, to, investigate, living, things, at, microscopic, scale, in, 1665, using, a, compound, microscope, that, he, designed, hooke, was, an, impoverished, scientific, inquirer, in, young, adulthood, who, went, on, to, become, one, of, the, most, important, scientists, of, his, time, after, the, great, fire, of, london, in, 1666, hooke, as, a, surveyor, and, architect, attained, wealth, and, esteem, by, performing, more, than, half, of, the, property, line, surveys, and, assisting, with, the, city, s, rapid, reconstruction, often, vilified, by, writers, in, the, centuries, after, his, death, his, reputation, was, restored, at, the, end, of, the, twentieth, century, and, he, has, been, called, england, s, leonardo, hooke, was, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, and, from, 1662, he, was, its, first, curator, of, experiments, from, 1665, to, 1703, he, was, also, professor, of, geometry, at, gresham, college, hooke, began, his, scientific, career, as, an, assistant, to, the, physical, scientist, robert, boyle, hooke, built, the, vacuum, pumps, that, were, used, in, boyle, s, experiments, on, gas, law, and, also, conducted, experiments, in, 1664, hooke, identified, the, rotations, of, mars, and, jupiter, hooke, s, 1665, book, micrographia, in, which, he, coined, the, term, cell, encouraged, microscopic, investigations, investigating, optics, specifically, light, refraction, hooke, inferred, a, wave, theory, of, light, his, is, the, first, recorded, hypothesis, of, the, cause, of, the, expansion, of, matter, by, heat, of, air, s, composition, by, small, particles, in, constant, motion, that, thus, generate, its, pressure, and, of, heat, as, energy, in, physics, hooke, inferred, that, gravity, obeys, an, inverse, square, law, and, arguably, was, the, first, to, hypothesise, such, a, relation, in, planetary, motion, a, principle, isaac, newton, furthered, and, formalised, in, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, priority, over, this, insight, contributed, to, the, rivalry, between, hooke, and, newton, in, geology, and, palaeontology, hooke, originated, the, theory, of, a, terraqueous, globe, thus, disputing, the, biblical, view, of, the, earth, s, age, he, also, hypothesised, the, extinction, of, species, and, argued, hills, and, mountains, had, become, elevated, by, geological, processes, by, identifying, fossils, of, extinct, species, hooke, presaged, the, theory, of, biological, evolution, much, of, what, is, known, of, hooke, s, early, life, comes, from, an, autobiography, he, commenced, in, 1696, but, never, completed, richard, waller, frs, mentions, it, in, his, introduction, to, the, posthumous, works, of, robert, hooke, m, d, s, r, s, which, was, printed, in, 1705, the, work, of, waller, along, with, john, ward, s, lives, of, the, gresham, professors, and, john, aubrey, s, brief, lives, form, the, major, near, contemporaneous, biographical, accounts, of, his, life, hooke, was, born, in, 1635, in, freshwater, isle, of, wight, to, cecily, gyles, and, the, anglican, priest, john, hooke, who, was, the, curate, of, all, saints, church, freshwater, robert, was, the, youngest, by, seven, years, of, four, siblings, two, boys, and, two, girls, he, was, frail, and, not, expected, to, live, although, his, father, gave, him, some, instruction, in, english, latin, grammar, and, divinity, robert, s, education, was, largely, neglected, left, to, his, own, devices, he, made, little, mechanical, toys, seeing, a, brass, clock, dismantled, he, built, a, wooden, replica, that, would, go, hooke, s, father, died, in, october, 1648, leaving, 40, in, his, will, to, robert, plus, another, 10, held, over, from, his, grandmother, at, the, age, of, 13, he, took, this, to, london, to, become, an, apprentice, to, the, celebrated, painter, peter, lely, hooke, also, had, some, instruction, in, drawing, from, the, limner, samuel, cowper, but, the, smell, of, the, oil, colours, did, not, agree, with, his, constitution, increasing, his, head, ache, to, which, he, was, ever, too, much, subject, and, he, became, a, pupil, at, westminster, school, living, with, its, master, richard, busby, hooke, quickly, mastered, latin, greek, and, euclid, s, elements, he, also, learnt, to, play, the, organ, and, began, his, lifelong, study, of, mechanics, he, remained, an, accomplished, draughtsman, as, he, was, later, to, demonstrate, in, his, drawings, that, illustrate, the, work, of, robert, boyle, and, hooke, s, own, micrographia, in, 1653, hooke, secured, a, place, at, christ, church, oxford, receiving, free, tuition, and, accommodation, as, an, organist, and, a, chorister, and, a, basic, income, as, a, servitor, despite, the, fact, he, did, not, officially, matriculate, until, 1658, in, 1662, hooke, was, awarded, a, master, of, arts, degree, while, a, student, at, oxford, hooke, was, also, employed, as, an, assistant, to, dr, thomas, willis, a, physician, chemist, and, member, of, the, oxford, philosophical, club, the, philosophical, club, had, been, founded, by, john, wilkins, warden, of, wadham, college, who, led, this, important, group, of, scientists, who, went, on, to, form, the, nucleus, of, the, royal, society, in, 1659, hooke, described, to, the, club, some, elements, of, a, method, of, heavier, than, air, flight, but, concluded, human, muscles, were, insufficient, to, the, task, through, the, club, hooke, met, seth, ward, the, university, s, savilian, professor, of, astronomy, and, developed, for, ward, a, mechanism, that, improved, the, regularity, of, pendulum, clocks, used, for, astronomical, time, keeping, hooke, characterised, his, oxford, days, as, the, foundation, of, his, lifelong, passion, for, science, the, friends, he, made, there, particularly, christopher, wren, were, important, to, him, throughout, his, career, willis, introduced, hooke, to, robert, boyle, who, the, club, sought, to, attract, to, oxford, in, 1655, boyle, moved, to, oxford, and, hooke, became, nominally, his, assistant, but, in, practice, his, co, experimenter, boyle, had, been, working, on, gas, pressures, the, possibility, a, vacuum, might, exist, despite, aristotle, s, maxim, nature, abhors, a, vacuum, had, just, begun, to, be, considered, hooke, developed, an, air, pump, for, boyle, s, experiments, rather, than, use, ralph, greatorex, s, pump, which, hooke, considered, as, too, gross, to, perform, any, great, matter, hooke, s, engine, enabled, the, development, of, the, eponymous, law, that, was, subsequently, attributed, to, boyle, hooke, had, a, particularly, keen, eye, and, was, an, adept, mathematician, neither, of, which, applied, to, boyle, hooke, taught, boyle, euclid, s, elements, and, descartes, s, principles, of, philosophy, it, also, caused, them, to, recognise, fire, as, a, chemical, reaction, and, not, as, aristotle, taught, a, fundamental, element, of, nature, according, to, henry, robinson, librarian, of, the, royal, society, in, 1935, without, his, weekly, experiments, and, prolific, work, the, society, could, scarcely, have, survived, or, at, least, would, have, developed, in, a, quite, different, way, it, is, scarcely, an, exaggeration, to, say, that, he, was, historically, the, creator, of, the, royal, society, the, royal, society, for, the, improvement, of, natural, knowledge, by, experiment, was, founded, in, 1660, and, given, its, royal, charter, in, july, 1662, on, 5, november, 1661, robert, moray, proposed, the, appointment, of, a, curator, to, furnish, the, society, with, experiments, and, this, was, unanimously, passed, and, hooke, was, named, on, boyle, s, recommendation, the, society, did, not, have, a, reliable, income, to, fully, fund, the, post, of, curator, of, experiments, but, in, 1664, john, cutler, settled, an, annual, gratuity, of, 50, on, the, society, to, found, a, mechanick, lectureship, at, gresham, college, on, the, understanding, the, society, would, appoint, hooke, to, this, task, on, 27, june, 1664, hooke, was, confirmed, to, the, office, and, on, 11, january, 1665, he, was, named, curator, by, office, for, life, with, an, annual, salary, of, 80, which, consisting, of, 30, from, the, society, and, cutler, s, 50, annuity, in, june, 1663, hooke, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, frs, on, 20, march, 1665, he, was, also, appointed, gresham, professor, of, geometry, on, 13, september, 1667, hooke, became, acting, secretary, of, the, society, and, on, 19, december, 1667, he, was, appointed, its, joint, secretary, although, john, aubrey, described, hooke, as, a, person, of, great, virtue, and, goodness, much, has, been, written, about, the, unpleasant, side, of, hooke, s, personality, according, to, his, first, biographer, richard, waller, hooke, was, in, person, but, despicable, and, melancholy, mistrustful, and, jealous, waller, s, comments, influenced, other, writers, for, more, than, 200, years, such, that, many, books, and, articles, especially, biographies, of, isaac, newton, portray, hooke, as, a, disgruntled, selfish, anti, social, curmudgeon, for, example, arthur, berry, said, hooke, claimed, credit, for, most, of, the, scientific, discoveries, of, the, time, sullivan, wrote, he, was, positively, unscrupulous, and, had, an, uneasy, apprehensive, vanity, in, dealings, with, newton, manuel, described, hooke, as, cantankerous, envious, vengeful, according, to, more, hooke, had, both, a, cynical, temperament, and, a, caustic, tongue, andrade, was, more, sympathetic, but, still, described, hooke, as, difficult, suspicious, and, irritable, in, october, 1675, the, council, of, the, royal, society, considered, a, motion, to, expel, hooke, because, of, an, attack, he, made, on, christiaan, huygens, over, scientific, priority, in, watch, design, but, it, did, not, pass, according, to, hooke, s, biographer, ellen, drake, if, one, studies, the, intellectual, milieu, of, the, time, the, controversies, and, rivalries, of, the, type, in, which, he, was, involved, seem, almost, to, be, the, rule, rather, than, the, exception, and, hooke, s, reaction, to, such, controversy, involving, his, own, discoveries, and, inventions, seems, mild, in, comparison, to, the, behaviour, of, some, of, his, contemporaries, the, publication, of, hooke, s, diary, in, 1935, revealed, previously, unknown, details, about, his, social, and, familial, relationships, his, biographer, margaret, espinasse, said, the, picture, which, is, usually, painted, of, hooke, as, a, morose, recluse, is, completely, false, he, interacted, with, noted, artisans, such, as, clock, maker, thomas, tompion, and, instrument, maker, christopher, cocks, cox, hooke, often, met, christopher, wren, with, whom, he, shared, many, interests, and, had, a, lasting, friendship, with, john, aubrey, his, diaries, also, make, frequent, reference, to, meetings, at, coffeehouses, and, taverns, as, well, as, to, dinners, with, robert, boyle, on, many, occasions, hooke, took, tea, with, his, lab, assistant, harry, hunt, although, he, largely, lived, alone, apart, from, the, servants, who, ran, his, home, his, niece, grace, hooke, and, his, cousin, tom, giles, lived, with, him, for, some, years, as, children, hooke, never, married, according, to, his, diary, hooke, sexually, abused, his, niece, grace, who, was, in, his, custody, between, the, ages, of, 10, and, 17, and, he, also, had, sexual, relations, with, several, maids, and, housekeepers, since, childhood, hooke, suffered, from, migraine, tinnitus, dizziness, and, bouts, of, insomnia, he, also, had, a, spinal, deformity, that, was, consistent, with, a, diagnosis, of, scheuermann, s, kyphosis, giving, him, in, middle, and, later, years, a, thin, and, crooked, body, over, large, head, and, protruding, eyes, approaching, these, in, a, scientific, spirit, he, experimented, with, self, medication, diligently, recording, symptoms, substances, and, effects, in, his, diary, he, regularly, used, sal, ammoniac, emetics, laxatives, and, opiates, which, appear, to, have, had, an, increasing, effect, on, his, physical, and, mental, health, over, time, hooke, died, in, london, on, 3, march, 1703, having, been, blind, and, bedridden, during, the, last, year, of, his, life, a, chest, containing, 8, 000, in, money, and, gold, was, found, in, his, room, at, gresham, college, his, library, contained, over, 3, 000, books, in, latin, french, italian, and, english, although, he, had, talked, of, leaving, a, generous, bequest, to, the, royal, society, which, would, have, given, his, name, to, a, library, laboratory, and, lectures, no, will, was, found, and, the, money, passed, to, a, cousin, named, elizabeth, stephens, hooke, was, buried, at, st, helen, s, church, bishopsgate, in, the, city, of, london, but, the, precise, location, of, his, grave, is, unknown, hooke, s, role, at, the, royal, society, was, to, demonstrate, experiments, from, his, own, methods, or, at, the, suggestion, of, members, among, his, earliest, demonstrations, were, discussions, of, the, nature, of, air, and, the, implosion, of, glass, bubbles, that, had, been, sealed, with, enclosed, hot, air, he, also, demonstrated, that, a, dog, could, be, kept, alive, with, its, thorax, opened, provided, air, was, pumped, in, and, out, of, its, lungs, he, noted, the, difference, between, venous, and, arterial, blood, and, thus, demonstrated, that, the, pabulum, vitae, food, of, life, and, flammae, were, the, same, thing, there, were, also, experiments, on, gravity, the, falling, of, objects, the, weighing, of, bodies, the, measurement, of, barometric, pressure, at, different, heights, and, the, movement, of, pendulums, up, to, 200, ft, long, 61, m, his, biographer, margaret, espinasse, described, him, as, england, s, first, meteorologist, in, her, description, of, his, essay, method, for, making, a, history, of, the, weather, hooke, specifies, that, a, thermometer, a, hygrometer, a, wind, gauge, and, a, record, sheet, be, used, for, proper, weather, records, in, may, 1664, using, a, 12, ft, 3, 7, m, refracting, telescope, hooke, observed, the, great, red, spot, of, jupiter, for, two, hours, as, it, moved, across, the, planet, s, face, in, march, 1665, he, published, his, findings, and, from, them, the, italian, astronomer, giovanni, cassini, calculated, the, rotation, period, of, jupiter, to, be, nine, hours, and, fifty, five, minutes, one, of, the, most, challenging, problems, hooke, investigated, was, the, measurement, of, the, distance, from, earth, to, a, star, other, than, the, sun, hooke, selected, the, star, gamma, draconis, and, chose, the, method, of, parallax, determination, in, 1669, after, several, months, of, observing, hooke, believed, the, desired, result, had, been, achieved, it, is, now, known, his, equipment, was, far, too, imprecise, to, obtain, an, accurate, measurement, hooke, s, micrographia, contains, illustrations, of, the, pleiades, star, cluster, and, lunar, craters, he, conducted, experiments, to, investigate, the, formation, of, these, craters, and, concluded, their, existence, meant, the, moon, must, have, its, own, gravity, a, radical, departure, from, the, contemporaneous, aristotelian, celestial, model, he, also, was, an, early, observer, of, the, rings, of, saturn, and, discovered, one, of, the, first, observed, double, star, systems, gamma, arietis, in, 1664, to, achieve, these, discoveries, hooke, needed, better, instruments, than, those, that, were, available, at, the, time, accordingly, he, invented, three, new, mechanisms, the, hooke, joint, a, sophisticated, universal, joint, that, allowed, his, instruments, to, smoothly, follow, the, apparent, motion, of, the, observed, body, the, first, clockwork, drive, to, automate, the, process, and, a, micrometer, screw, that, allowed, him, to, achieve, a, precision, of, ten, seconds, of, arc, hooke, was, dissatisfied, with, refracting, telescopes, so, he, built, the, first, practical, gregorian, telescope, that, used, a, silvered, glass, mirror, in, 1660, hooke, discovered, the, law, of, elasticity, that, bears, his, name, and, describes, the, linear, variation, of, tension, with, extension, in, an, elastic, spring, hooke, first, described, this, discovery, in, an, anagram, ceiiinosssttuv, whose, solution, he, published, in, 1678, as, ut, tensio, sic, vis, as, the, extension, so, the, force, his, work, on, elasticity, culminated, in, his, development, of, the, balance, spring, or, hairspring, which, for, the, first, time, enabled, a, portable, timepiece, a, watch, to, keep, time, with, reasonable, accuracy, a, bitter, dispute, between, hooke, and, christiaan, huygens, on, the, priority, of, this, invention, was, to, continue, for, centuries, after, the, death, of, both, but, a, note, dated, 23, june, 1670, in, the, journals, of, the, royal, society, describing, a, demonstration, of, a, balance, controlled, watch, before, the, royal, society, may, support, hooke, s, claim, to, priority, for, the, idea, nevertheless, it, is, huygens, who, is, credited, with, building, the, first, watch, to, use, a, balance, spring, hooke, s, announcement, of, his, law, of, elasticity, using, an, anagram, was, a, method, scientists, such, as, hooke, huygens, and, galileo, sometimes, used, to, establish, priority, for, a, discovery, without, revealing, details, hooke, used, mechanical, analogues, to, understand, fundamental, processes, such, as, the, motion, of, a, spherical, pendulum, and, of, a, ball, in, a, hollow, cone, to, demonstrate, central, force, due, to, gravity, and, a, hanging, chain, net, with, point, loads, to, provide, the, optimum, shape, for, a, dome, with, heavy, cross, on, top, despite, continuing, reports, to, the, contrary, hooke, did, not, influence, thomas, newcomen, s, invention, of, the, steam, engine, this, myth, which, originated, in, an, article, in, the, third, edition, of, encyclop, dia, britannica, has, been, found, to, be, mistaken, while, many, of, hooke, s, contemporaries, such, as, isaac, newton, believed, in, aether, as, a, medium, for, transmitting, attraction, and, repulsion, between, separated, celestial, bodies, hooke, argued, for, an, attracting, principle, of, gravitation, in, micrographia, 1665, in, a, communication, to, the, royal, society, in, 1666, he, wrote, i, will, explain, a, system, of, the, world, very, different, from, any, yet, received, it, is, founded, on, the, following, positions, 1, that, all, the, heavenly, bodies, have, not, only, a, gravitation, of, their, parts, to, their, own, proper, centre, but, that, they, also, mutually, attract, each, other, within, their, spheres, of, action, 2, that, all, bodies, having, a, simple, motion, will, continue, to, move, in, a, straight, line, unless, continually, deflected, from, it, by, some, extraneous, force, causing, them, to, describe, a, circle, an, ellipse, or, some, other, curve, 3, that, this, attraction, is, so, much, the, greater, as, the, bodies, are, nearer, as, to, the, proportion, in, which, those, forces, diminish, by, an, increase, of, distance, i, own, i, have, not, discovered, it, hooke, s, 1674, gresham, lecture, an, attempt, to, prove, the, motion, of, the, earth, by, observations, published, 1679, said, gravitation, applies, to, all, celestial, bodies, and, restated, these, three, propositions, hooke, s, statements, up, to, 1674, make, no, mention, however, that, an, inverse, square, law, applies, or, might, apply, to, these, attractions, his, model, of, gravitation, was, also, not, yet, universal, though, it, approached, universality, more, closely, than, previous, hypotheses, hooke, did, not, provide, accompanying, evidence, or, mathematical, demonstration, he, stated, in, 1674, now, what, these, several, degrees, are, i, have, not, yet, experimentally, verified, indicating, he, did, not, yet, know, what, law, the, gravitation, might, follow, and, about, his, whole, proposal, he, said, this, i, only, hint, at, present, having, my, self, many, other, things, in, hand, which, i, would, first, compleat, and, therefore, cannot, so, well, attend, it, i, e, prosecuting, this, inquiry, in, november, 1679, hooke, initiated, a, notable, exchange, of, letters, with, newton, that, was, published, in, 1960, hooke, s, ostensible, purpose, was, to, tell, newton, he, hooke, had, been, appointed, to, manage, the, royal, society, s, correspondence, hooke, therefore, wanted, to, hear, from, members, about, their, research, or, their, views, about, the, research, of, others, hooke, asked, newton, s, opinions, about, various, matters, among, other, items, hooke, mentioned, compounding, the, celestial, motions, of, the, planets, of, a, direct, motion, by, the, tangent, and, an, attractive, motion, towards, the, central, body, his, hypothesis, of, the, lawes, or, causes, of, springinesse, a, new, hypothesis, from, paris, about, planetary, motions, which, he, described, at, length, efforts, to, carry, out, or, improve, national, surveys, and, the, difference, of, latitude, between, london, and, cambridge, newton, s, reply, offered, a, fansy, of, my, own, about, a, terrestrial, experiment, rather, than, a, proposal, about, celestial, motions, that, might, detect, the, earth, s, motion, the, experiment, would, use, a, body, suspended, in, air, and, then, dropped, hooke, wanted, to, discern, how, newton, thought, the, falling, body, could, experimentally, reveal, the, earth, s, motion, by, its, direction, of, deviation, from, the, vertical, but, hooke, went, on, hypothetically, to, consider, how, its, motion, could, continue, if, the, solid, earth, had, not, been, in, the, way, on, a, spiral, path, to, the, centre, hooke, disagreed, with, newton, s, idea, of, the, body, s, continuing, motion, a, further, short, correspondence, developed, towards, the, end, of, it, writing, on, 6, january, 1680, to, newton, hooke, communicated, his, supposition, that, the, attraction, always, is, in, a, duplicate, proportion, to, the, distance, from, the, center, reciprocall, and, consequently, that, the, velocity, will, be, in, a, subduplicate, proportion, to, the, attraction, and, consequently, as, kepler, supposes, reciprocall, to, the, distance, hooke, s, inference, about, the, velocity, is, incorrect, in, 1686, when, the, first, book, of, newton, s, principia, was, presented, to, the, royal, society, hooke, said, he, had, given, newton, the, notion, of, the, rule, of, the, decrease, of, gravity, being, reciprocally, as, the, squares, of, the, distances, from, the, center, at, the, same, time, according, to, edmond, halley, s, contemporaneous, report, hooke, agreed, the, demonstration, of, the, curves, generated, thereby, was, wholly, newton, s, according, to, a, 2002, assessment, of, the, early, history, of, the, inverse, square, law, by, the, late, 1660s, the, assumption, of, an, inverse, proportion, between, gravity, and, the, square, of, distance, was, rather, common, and, had, been, advanced, by, a, number, of, different, people, for, different, reasons, in, the, 1660s, newton, had, shown, for, planetary, motion, under, a, circular, assumption, force, in, the, radial, direction, had, an, inverse, square, relation, with, distance, from, the, centre, newton, who, in, may, 1686, was, presented, with, hooke, s, claim, to, priority, on, the, inverse, square, law, denied, he, was, to, be, credited, as, author, of, the, idea, giving, reasons, including, the, citation, of, prior, work, by, others, newton, also, said, that, even, if, he, had, first, heard, of, the, inverse, square, proportion, from, hooke, which, newton, said, he, had, not, he, would, still, have, some, rights, to, it, because, of, his, mathematical, developments, and, demonstrations, these, he, said, enabled, observations, to, be, relied, upon, as, evidence, of, its, accuracy, while, according, to, newton, hooke, without, mathematical, demonstrations, and, evidence, in, favour, of, the, supposition, could, only, guess, it, was, approximately, valid, at, great, distances, from, the, centre, newton, did, accept, and, acknowledge, in, all, editions, of, the, principia, hooke, and, others, had, separately, appreciated, the, inverse, square, law, in, the, solar, system, newton, acknowledged, wren, hooke, and, halley, in, this, connection, in, his, scholium, to, proposition, 4, in, book, 1, in, a, letter, to, halley, newton, also, acknowledged, his, correspondence, with, hooke, in, 1679, 1680, had, reawakened, his, dormant, interest, in, astronomical, matters, but, that, did, not, mean, according, to, newton, hooke, had, told, newton, anything, new, or, original, newton, wrote, yet, am, i, not, beholden, to, him, for, any, light, into, that, business, but, only, for, the, diversion, he, gave, me, from, my, other, studies, to, think, on, these, things, for, his, dogmaticalness, in, writing, as, if, he, had, found, the, motion, in, the, ellipsis, which, inclined, me, to, try, it, whilst, newton, was, primarily, a, pioneer, in, mathematical, analysis, and, its, applications, and, optical, experimentation, hooke, was, a, creative, experimenter, of, such, great, range, who, left, some, of, his, ideas, such, as, those, about, gravitation, undeveloped, in, 1759, decades, after, the, deaths, of, both, newton, and, hooke, alexis, clairaut, mathematical, astronomer, eminent, in, his, own, right, in, the, field, of, gravitational, studies, reviewed, hooke, s, published, work, on, gravitation, according, to, stephen, peter, rigaud, clairaut, wrote, the, example, of, hooke, and, that, of, kepler, to, show, what, a, distance, there, is, between, a, truth, that, is, glimpsed, and, a, truth, that, is, demonstrated, i, bernard, cohen, said, hooke, s, claim, to, the, inverse, square, law, has, masked, newton, s, far, more, fundamental, debt, to, him, the, analysis, of, curvilinear, orbital, motion, in, asking, for, too, much, credit, hooke, effectively, denied, to, himself, the, credit, due, him, for, a, seminal, idea, hooke, made, important, contributions, to, the, science, of, timekeeping, and, was, intimately, involved, in, the, advances, of, his, time, these, included, refinement, of, the, pendulum, as, a, better, regulator, for, clocks, increased, precision, of, clock, mechanisms, and, the, use, of, the, balance, spring, to, improve, the, timekeeping, of, watches, galileo, had, observed, the, regularity, of, a, pendulum, and, huygens, first, incorporated, it, in, a, clock, in, 1668, hooke, demonstrated, his, new, device, to, keep, a, pendulum, swinging, regularly, in, unsteady, conditions, his, invention, of, a, tooth, cutting, machine, enabled, a, substantial, improvement, in, the, accuracy, and, precision, of, timepieces, waller, reported, the, invention, was, by, hooke, s, death, in, constant, use, among, clock, makers, hooke, announced, he, conceived, a, way, to, build, a, marine, chronometer, to, determine, longitude, and, with, the, help, of, boyle, and, others, he, attempted, to, patent, it, in, the, process, hooke, demonstrated, a, pocket, watch, of, his, own, devising, that, was, fitted, with, a, coil, spring, attached, to, the, arbour, of, the, balance, hooke, s, refusal, to, accept, an, escape, clause, in, the, proposed, exclusive, contract, for, the, use, of, this, idea, resulted, in, its, abandonment, hooke, developed, the, principle, of, the, balance, spring, independently, of, huygens, and, at, least, five, years, beforehand, huygens, published, his, own, work, in, journal, de, scavans, in, february, 1675, and, built, the, first, functioning, watch, to, use, a, balance, spring, in, 1663, and, 1664, hooke, made, his, microscopic, and, some, astronomic, observations, which, he, collated, in, micrographia, in, 1665, his, book, which, describes, observations, with, microscopes, and, telescopes, as, well, as, original, work, in, biology, contains, the, earliest, recorded, observation, of, a, microorganism, the, microfungus, mucor, hooke, coined, the, term, cell, suggesting, a, resemblance, between, plant, structures, and, honeycomb, cells, the, hand, crafted, leather, and, gold, tooled, microscope, he, designed, and, used, to, make, the, observations, for, micrographia, which, christopher, cock, made, for, him, in, london, is, on, display, at, the, national, museum, of, health, and, medicine, in, maryland, hooke, s, work, developed, from, that, of, henry, power, who, published, his, microscopy, work, in, experimental, philosophy, 1663, in, turn, the, dutch, scientist, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, went, on, to, develop, increased, magnification, and, so, reveal, protozoa, blood, cells, and, spermatozoa, micrographia, also, contains, hooke, s, or, perhaps, boyle, s, and, hooke, s, ideas, on, combustion, hooke, s, experiments, led, him, to, conclude, combustion, involves, a, component, of, air, a, statement, with, which, modern, scientists, would, agree, but, that, was, not, understood, widely, if, at, all, in, the, seventeenth, century, he, also, concluded, respiration, and, combustion, involve, a, specific, and, limited, component, of, air, according, to, partington, if, hooke, had, continued, his, experiments, on, combustion, it, is, probable, that, he, would, have, discovered, oxygen, samuel, pepys, wrote, of, the, book, in, his, diary, on, 21, january, 16, 64, 65, before, i, went, to, bed, i, sat, up, till, two, o, clock, in, my, chamber, reading, of, mr, hooke, s, microscopicall, observations, the, most, ingenious, book, that, ever, i, read, in, my, life, one, of, the, observations, in, micrographia, is, of, fossil, wood, the, microscopic, structure, of, which, hooke, compared, to, that, of, ordinary, wood, this, led, him, to, conclude, that, fossilised, objects, like, petrified, wood, and, fossil, shells, such, as, ammonites, were, the, remains, of, living, things, that, had, been, soaked, in, mineral, laden, petrifying, water, he, believed, that, such, fossils, provided, reliable, clues, about, the, history, of, life, on, earth, and, despite, the, objections, of, contemporary, naturalists, like, john, ray, who, found, the, concept, of, extinction, theologically, unacceptable, that, in, some, cases, they, might, represent, species, that, had, become, extinct, through, some, geological, disaster, in, a, series, of, lectures, in, 1668, hooke, proposed, the, then, heretical, idea, the, earth, s, surface, had, been, formed, by, volcanoes, and, earthquakes, and, that, the, latter, were, responsible, for, shell, fossils, being, found, far, above, sea, level, in, 1835, charles, lyell, the, scottish, geologist, and, associate, of, charles, darwin, wrote, of, hooke, in, principles, of, geology, his, treatise, is, the, most, philosophical, production, of, that, age, in, regard, to, the, causes, of, former, changes, in, the, organic, and, inorganic, kingdoms, of, nature, hooke, s, scientific, model, of, human, memory, was, one, of, the, first, of, its, kind, in, a, 1682, lecture, to, the, royal, society, hooke, proposed, a, mechanical, analogue, model, of, human, memory, that, bore, little, resemblance, to, the, mainly, philosophical, models, of, earlier, writers, this, model, addressed, the, components, of, encoding, memory, capacity, repetition, retrieval, and, forgetting, some, with, surprisingly, modern, accuracy, according, to, psychology, professor, douglas, hintzman, hooke, s, model, s, most, interesting, points, are, that, it, allows, for, attention, and, other, top, down, influences, on, encoding, it, uses, resonance, to, implement, parallel, cue, dependent, retrieval, it, explains, memory, for, recency, it, offers, a, single, system, account, of, repetition, and, priming, and, the, power, law, of, forgetting, can, be, derived, from, the, model, s, assumption, in, a, straightforward, way, on, 8, july, 1680, hooke, observed, the, nodal, patterns, associated, with, the, modes, of, vibration, of, glass, plates, he, ran, a, bow, along, the, edge, of, a, flour, covered, glass, plate, and, saw, the, nodal, patterns, emerge, in, acoustics, in, 1681, hooke, showed, the, royal, society, that, musical, tones, can, be, generated, using, spinning, brass, cogs, cut, with, teeth, in, particular, proportions, robert, hooke, was, surveyor, to, the, city, of, london, and, chief, assistant, to, christopher, wren, in, which, capacities, he, helped, wren, rebuild, london, after, the, great, fire, of, 1666, hooke, designed, the, monument, to, the, great, fire, of, london, 1672, montagu, house, in, bloomsbury, 1674, and, bethlem, royal, hospital, 1674, which, became, known, as, bedlam, other, buildings, hooke, designed, include, the, royal, college, of, physicians, 1679, aske, s, hospital, 1679, ragley, hall, warwickshire, 1680, the, church, of, st, mary, magdalene, at, willen, buckinghamshire, 1680, and, ramsbury, manor, wiltshire, 1681, he, worked, on, many, of, the, london, churches, that, were, rebuilt, after, the, fire, hooke, was, generally, subcontracted, by, wren, from, 1671, to, 1696, wren, s, office, paid, hooke, 2, 820, in, fees, more, than, he, ever, earned, from, his, royal, society, and, cutler, lectureship, posts, wren, and, hooke, were, both, keen, astronomers, the, monument, to, the, great, fire, of, london, was, designed, to, serve, a, scientific, function, as, a, zenith, telescope, for, astronomical, observation, though, traffic, vibration, made, it, unusable, for, this, purpose, the, legacy, of, this, can, be, observed, in, the, construction, of, the, spiral, staircase, which, has, no, central, column, and, in, the, observation, chamber, which, remains, in, place, below, ground, level, he, also, collaborated, with, wren, on, the, design, of, st, paul, s, cathedral, hooke, determined, the, ideal, shape, of, an, arch, is, an, inverted, catenary, and, thence, that, a, circular, series, of, such, arches, makes, an, ideal, shape, for, the, cathedral, s, dome, in, the, reconstruction, after, the, great, fire, hooke, proposed, redesigning, london, s, streets, on, a, grid, pattern, with, wide, boulevards, and, arteries, a, pattern, that, was, later, used, in, haussmann, s, renovation, of, paris, and, in, many, american, cities, for, which, wren, and, others, also, submitted, proposals, the, king, decided, both, the, prospective, cost, of, building, and, compensation, and, the, need, to, quickly, restore, trade, and, population, meant, the, city, would, be, rebuilt, on, the, original, property, lines, hooke, was, given, the, task, of, surveying, the, ruins, to, identify, foundations, street, edges, and, property, boundaries, he, was, closely, involved, with, the, drafting, of, an, act, of, common, council, april, 1667, which, set, out, the, process, by, which, the, original, foundations, would, be, formally, recognised, and, certificated, according, to, lisa, jardine, in, the, four, weeks, from, the, 4th, of, october, helped, map, the, fire, damaged, area, began, compiling, a, land, information, system, for, london, and, drew, up, building, regulations, for, an, act, of, parliament, to, govern, the, rebuilding, stephen, inwood, said, the, surveyors, reports, which, were, generally, written, by, hooke, show, an, admirable, ability, to, get, to, the, nub, of, intricate, neighbourly, squabbles, and, to, produce, a, crisp, and, judicious, recommendation, from, a, tangle, of, claims, and, counter, claims, hooke, also, had, to, measure, and, certify, land, that, would, be, compulsorily, purchased, for, the, planned, road, widening, so, compensation, could, be, paid, in, 1670, he, was, appointed, surveyor, of, the, royal, works, hooke, together, with, the, work, of, scottish, cartographer, and, printer, john, ogilby, hooke, s, precise, and, detailed, surveys, led, to, production, in, 1677, of, a, large, scale, map, of, london, the, first, known, to, be, of, a, specific, scale, 1, 1200, no, authenticated, portrait, of, robert, hooke, exists, a, situation, that, has, sometimes, been, attributed, to, the, heated, conflicts, between, hooke, and, isaac, newton, although, hooke, s, biographer, allan, chapman, rejects, as, a, myth, claims, newton, or, his, acolytes, deliberately, destroyed, hooke, s, portrait, german, antiquarian, and, scholar, zacharias, conrad, von, uffenbach, visited, the, royal, society, in, 1710, and, his, account, of, his, visit, mentions, him, being, shown, portraits, of, boyle, and, hoock, which, were, said, to, be, good, likenesses, but, while, boyle, s, portrait, survives, hooke, s, has, been, lost, in, hooke, s, time, the, royal, society, met, at, gresham, college, but, within, a, few, months, of, hooke, s, death, newton, became, the, society, s, president, and, plans, for, a, new, meeting, place, were, made, when, the, royal, society, moved, to, new, premises, in, 1710, hooke, s, was, the, only, portrait, that, went, missing, and, remains, so, according, to, hooke, s, diary, he, sat, for, a, portrait, by, renowned, artist, mary, beale, so, it, is, possible, such, a, portrait, did, at, some, time, exist, conversely, chapman, draws, attention, to, the, fact, that, waller, s, extensively, illustrated, work, posthumous, works, of, robert, hooke, published, shortly, after, hooke, s, death, has, no, portrait, of, him, two, contemporaneous, written, descriptions, of, hooke, s, appearance, have, survived, his, close, friend, john, aubrey, described, him, in, middle, age, and, at, the, height, of, his, creative, powers, he, is, but, of, midling, stature, something, crooked, pale, faced, and, his, face, but, little, below, but, his, head, is, lardge, his, eie, full, and, popping, and, not, quick, a, grey, eie, he, haz, a, delicate, head, of, haire, browne, and, of, an, excellent, moist, curle, he, is, and, ever, was, temperate, and, moderate, in, dyet, etc, richard, waller, writing, in, 1705, in, the, posthumous, works, of, robert, hooke, described, the, elderly, hooke, as, to, his, person, he, was, but, despicable, being, very, crooked, tho, i, have, heard, from, himself, and, others, that, he, was, strait, till, about, 16, years, of, age, when, he, first, grew, awry, by, frequent, practising, with, a, turn, lath, he, was, always, very, pale, and, lean, and, laterly, nothing, but, skin, and, bone, with, a, meagre, aspect, his, eyes, grey, and, full, with, a, sharp, ingenious, look, whilst, younger, his, nose, but, thin, of, a, moderate, height, and, length, his, mouth, meanly, wide, and, upper, lip, thin, his, chin, sharp, and, forehead, large, his, head, of, a, middle, size, he, wore, his, own, hair, of, a, dark, brown, colour, very, long, and, hanging, neglected, over, his, face, uncut, and, lank, on, 3, july, 1939, time, magazine, published, a, portrait, supposedly, of, hooke, but, when, ashley, montagu, traced, the, source, it, was, found, to, lack, a, verifiable, connection, to, hooke, montagu, found, the, two, contemporaneous, written, descriptions, of, hooke, s, appearance, agree, with, one, another, but, that, neither, matches, the, portrait, in, time, in, 2003, historian, lisa, jardine, conjectured, that, a, recently, discovered, portrait, was, of, hooke, but, this, proposal, was, disproved, by, william, b, jensen, of, the, university, of, cincinnati, who, identified, the, subject, as, the, flemish, scholar, jan, baptist, van, helmont, other, possible, likenesses, of, hooke, include, in, 2003, the, amateur, painter, rita, greer, embarked, on, a, project, to, memorialise, hooke, and, produce, credible, images, of, him, both, painted, and, drawn, she, believes, match, aubrey, s, and, waller, s, the, descriptions, of, him, greer, s, images, of, hooke, which, are, free, to, use, under, the, free, art, license, have, been, used, for, television, programmes, in, the, uk, and, the, us, in, books, magazines, and, for, public, relations, in, 2019, larry, griffing, an, associate, professor, in, biology, at, texas, a, m, university, proposed, that, a, portrait, by, mary, beale, of, an, unknown, sitter, and, referred, to, as, portrait, of, a, mathematician, is, actually, of, hooke, noting, the, physical, features, of, the, sitter, in, the, portrait, match, hooke, s, the, figure, points, to, a, drawing, of, elliptical, motion, that, appears, to, match, an, unpublished, manuscript, created, by, him, the, painting, also, includes, an, orrery, depicting, the, same, principle, according, to, griffing, buildings, included, in, the, image, are, of, lowther, castle, now, in, cumbria, and, its, church, of, st, michael, the, church, was, renovated, under, one, of, hooke, s, architectural, commissions, which, beale, would, have, known, from, her, extensive, body, of, work, for, the, lowther, family, according, to, griffing, the, painting, would, once, have, been, owned, by, the, royal, society, but, was, abandoned, when, newton, its, president, moved, the, society, s, headquarters, in, 1710, christopher, whittaker, of, the, school, of, education, university, of, durham, england, has, questioned, griffing, s, analysis, according, to, whittaker, it, is, more, likely, to, be, of, isaac, barrow, in, a, response, to, whittaker, griffing, reaffirmed, his, deduction
