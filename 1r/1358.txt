the, french, considered, emperor, maximilian, to, be, doomed, due, to, a, lack, of, popular, support, and, began, to, pressure, him, to, abdicate, french, authorities, considered, forming, an, alternative, liberal, government, more, accommodating, and, less, humiliating, to, french, interests, than, ju, rez, and, d, az, was, proposed, but, ultimately, rejected, as, a, candidate, to, lead, such, a, government, due, to, his, loyalty, to, ju, rez, the, alternative, government, scheme, never, materialized, maximilian, refused, to, abdicate, and, the, french, left, him, in, mexico, to, his,

future, operations, on, 9, march, 1867, d, az, began, the, third, battle, of, puebla, subjecting, the, city, to, an, attack, much, like, the, one, he, had, once, defended, it, from, taking, the, city, by, 2, april, d, az, spared, the, troops, but, ordered, the, execution, of, the, officers, taunting, them, by, saying, that, even, though, they, had, not, lived, like, men, they, could, die, like, men, all, that, remained, of, the, empire, were, quer, taro, city, where, maximilian, and, his, leading, generals, were, present, mexico, city, and, veracruz, the, latter, two, which, had, through, d,

28, 000, troops, yet, being, concerned, with, preventing, damage, to, the, capital, he, did, not, attack, and, a, seventy, day, standoff, ensued, meanwhile, the, siege, of, quer, taro, against, emperor, maximilian, s, headquarters, was, ongoing, and, ultimately, ended, by, may, 14, in, a, liberal, victory, even, after, maximilian, had, been, captured, leonardo, m, rquez, was, stalling, for, time, at, mexico, city, but, hope, for, the, imperialists, was, running, out, m, rquez, officer, general, o, horan, went, to, meet, d, az, without, authorization, and, offered, to, surrender, the,

successfully, escaped, the, country, to, find, refuge, in, cuba, d, az, declared, himself, a, candidate, for, presidential, elections, scheduled, for, august, 1867, meanwhile, president, juarez,

new, term, scheduled, to, end, on, 30, november, 1871, ju, rez, controversially, once, more, declared, his, candidacy, for, the, 1871, elections, which, he, won, again, against, d, az, supporters, of,

tejada, president, lerdo, offered, an, amnesty, to, the, rebels, in, july, 1872, an, offer, which, many, commanders, subsequently, took, diaz, himself, refused, it, and, on, 1, august, sent, a, letter, to, the, president, urging, a, modification, of, the, amnesty, terms, and, urging, an, extension, for, upcoming, presidential, elections, in, october, ostensibly, to, allow, rebellious, regions, to, fully, participate, the, president, was, absolutely, unyielding, but, so, was, diaz, who, urged, lerdo, in, a, later, communication, to, also, initiate, constitutional, reforms, to, prohibit, presidential, reelection, as, more, rebel, commanders, yielded, and, the, october, elections, came, and, went, with, lerdo, winning, an, overwhelming, majority, of, votes, diaz, realized, that, his, case, was, hopeless, and, finally, submitted, unconditionally, before, the, amnesty, in, late, october, diaz, was, eventually, restored, to, official, military, rank, in, 1874, but, retired, to, private, life, and, subsequently, moved, to, the, united, states, in, december, 1875, settling, in, brownsville, texas, across, the, border, from, matamoros, in, early, 1876, president,

against, the, lerdo, administration, focusing, on, the, claim, that, the, president, s, domination, of, the, electoral, process, rendered, free, suffrage, null, diaz, was, declared, the, military, leader, of, the, revolution, and, lerdo, was, declared, deposed, along, with, all, governors, who, would, not, acceed, to, the, tuxtepec, plan, the, interim, executive, was, first, offered, to, president, of, the, supreme, court, and, legal, successor, to, the, president, jos, mar, a, iglesias, but, he, rejected, any, role, in, the, plan, as, a, violation, of, the, constitution, the, revolutionaries, now, recognized, diaz, as, president, as, federalist, forces, under, mariano, escobedo, approached, diaz, the, latter, was, forced, to, take, flight, intending, to, rejoin, the,

elections, of, july, a, rival, revolt, known, as, the, plan, of, salamanca, had, flared, up, under, iglesias, alleging, that, lerdo, s, election, had, been, fraudulent, and, that, he, was, now, the, legitimate, president, of, mexico, until, legal, elections, could, be, held, iglesias, began, to, correspond, with, diaz, hoping, to, unite, their, movements, but, no, agreement, could, be, reached, even, after, the, flight, of, lerdo, diaz, entered, mexico, city, on, 29, november, and, finally, ascended, to, the, presidency, he, organized, his, cabinet, but, now, focused, on, crushing, the, movement, of, iglesias, and, set, out, for, the, latter, s, base, in, guanajuato, with, 10, 000, men, iglesias, began, to, experience, mass, defections, in, both, political, and, military, support, and, after, a, series, of, failed, negotiations, with, diaz, in, december, decided, upon, giving, up, and, departing, the, country, the, victorious, diaz, reentered, the, capital, on, 12, february, 1877, d, az, did, not, take, formal, control, of, the, presidency, until, the, beginning, of, 1877, putting, in, general, juan, n, m, ndez, as, provisional, president, followed, by, new, presidential, elections, in, 1877, that, gave, d, az, the, presidency, ironically, one, of, his, government, s, first, amendments, to, the, liberal, 1857, constitution, was, to, prevent, re, election, although, the, new, election, gave, some, air, of, legitimacy, to, d, az, s, government, the, united, states, did, not, recognize, the, regime, it, was, not, clear, that, d, az, would, continue, to, prevail, against, supporters, of, ousted, president, lerdo, who, continued, to, challenge, d, az, s, regime, by, insurrections, which, ultimately, failed, in, addition, cross, border, apache, attacks, with, raids, on, one, side, and, sanctuary, on, the, other, were, a, sticking, point, mexico, needed, to, meet, several, conditions, before, the, u, s, would, consider, recognizing, d, az, s, government, including, payment, of, a, debt, to, the, u, s, and, restraining, the, cross, border, apache, raids, the, u, s, emissary, to, mexico, john, w, foster, had, the, duty, to, protect, the, interests, of, the, u, s, first, and, foremost, lerdo, s, government, had, entered, into, negotiations, with, the, u, s, over, claims, that, each, had, against, the, other, in, previous, conflicts, a, joint, u, s, mexico, claims, commission, was, established, in, 1868, in, the, wake, of, the, fall, of, the, french, empire, when, d, az, seized, power, from, lerdo, s, government, he, inherited, lerdo, s, negotiated, settlement, with, the, u, s, as, mexican, historian, daniel, cos, o, villegas, put, it, he, who, wins, pays, d, az, secured, recognition, by, paying, 300, 000, to, settle, claims, by, the, u, s, in, 1878, the, u, s, government, recognized, the, d, az, regime, and, former, u, s, president, and, civil, war, hero, ulysses, s, grant, visited, mexico, see, also, lerdista, uprising, of, 1878, during, his, first, term, in, office, d, az, developed, a, pragmatic, and, personalist, approach, to, solve, political, conflicts, although, a, political, liberal, who, had, stood, with, radical, liberals, in, oaxaca, rojos, he, was, not, a, liberal, ideologue, preferring, pragmatic, approaches, towards, political, issues, he, was, explicit, about, his, pragmatism, he, maintained, control, through, generous, patronage, to, political, allies, in, his, first, term, members, of, his, political, alliance, were, discontented, that, they, had, not, sufficiently, benefited, from, political, and, financial, rewards, in, general, he, sought, conciliation, but, force, could, be, an, option, five, fingers, or, five, bullets, as, he, was, fond, of, saying, although, he, was, an, authoritarian, ruler, he, maintained, the, structure, of, elections, so, that, there, was, the, fa, ade, of, liberal, democracy, his, administration, became, famous, for, the, suppression, of, civil, society, and, public, revolts, one, of, the, catch, phrases, of, his, later, terms, in, office, was, the, choice, between, pan, o, palo, bread, or, the, bludgeon, that, is, benevolence, or, repression, d, az, saw, his, task, in, his, term, as, president, to, create, internal, order, so, that, economic, development, could, be, possible, as, a, military, hero, and, astute, politician, d, az, s, eventual, successful, establishment, of, that, peace, paz, porfiriana, became, one, of, principal, achievements, and, it, became, the, main, justification, for, successive, re, elections, after, 1884, d, az, and, his, advisers, pragmatism, in, relation, to, the, united, states, became, the, policy, of, defensive, modernization, which, attempted, to, make, the, best, of, mexico, s, weak, position, against, its, northern, neighbor, attributed, to, d, az, was, the, phrase, so, far, from, god, so, close, to, the, united, states, d, az, s, advisers, mat, as, romero, ju, rez, s, emissary, to, the, u, s, and, manuel, zamacona, a, minister, in, ju, rez, s, government, advised, a, policy, of, peaceful, invasion, of, u, s, capital, to, mexico, with, the, expectation, that, it, would, then, be, naturalized, in, mexico, in, their, view, such, an, arrangement, would, provide, all, possible, advantages, of, annexation, without, its, inconveniences, d, az, was, won, over, to, that, viewpoint, which, promoted, mexican, economic, development, and, gave, the, u, s, an, outlet, for, its, capital, and, allowed, for, its, influence, in, mexico, by, 1880, mexico, was, forging, a, new, relationship, with, the, u, s, as, d, az, s, term, of, office, was, ending, d, az, stepped, down, from, the, presidency, with, his, ally, general, manuel, gonz, lez, one, of, the, trustworthy, members, of, his, political, network, camarilla, elected, president, in, a, fully, constitutional, manner, this, four, year, period, often, characterized, as, the, gonz, lez, interregnum, is, sometimes, seen, as, d, az, placing, a, puppet, in, the, presidency, but, gonz, lez, ruled, in, his, own, right, and, was, viewed, as, a, legitimate, president, free, of, the, taint, of, coming, to, power, by, coup, during, this, period, d, az, briefly, served, as, governor, of, his, home, state, of, oaxaca, he, also, devoted, time, to, his, personal, life, highlighted, by, his, marriage, to, carmen, romero, rubio, the, devout, 17, year, old, daughter, of, manuel, romero, rubio, a, supporter, of, lerdo, the, couple, honeymooned, in, the, u, s, going, to, the, world, cotton, centennial, in, new, orleans, then, st, louis, washington, d, c, and, new, york, accompanying, them, on, their, travels, was, mat, as, romero, and, his, u, s, born, wife, this, working, honeymoon, allowed, d, az, to, forge, personal, connections, with, politicians, and, powerful, businessmen, with, romero, s, friends, including, former, u, s, president, ulysses, s, grant, romero, then, publicized, the, growing, amity, between, the, two, countries, and, the, safety, of, mexico, for, u, s, investors, president, gonz, lez, was, making, room, in, his, government, for, political, networks, not, originally, part, of, d, az, s, coalition, some, of, whom, had, been, loyalists, to, lerdo, including, evaristo, madero, whose, grandson, francisco, would, challenge, d, az, for, the, presidency, in, 1910, important, legislation, changing, rights, to, land, and, subsoil, rights, and, encouraging, immigration, and, colonization, by, u, s, nationals, was, passed, during, the, gonz, lez, presidency, the, administration, also, extended, lucrative, railway, concessions, to, u, s, investors, despite, those, developments, the, gonz, lez, administration, met, financial, and, political, difficulties, with, the, later, period, bringing, the, government, to, bankruptcy, and, popular, opposition, d, az, s, father, in, law, manuel, romero, rubio, linked, these, issues, to, personal, corruption, by, gonz, lez, despite, d, az, s, previous, protestations, of, no, re, election, he, ran, for, a, second, term, in, the, 1884, elections, during, this, period, the, mexican, underground, political, newspapers, spread, the, new, ironic, slogan, for, the, porfirian, times, based, on, the, slogan, sufragio, efectivo, no, reelecci, n, effective, suffrage, no, re, election, and, changed, it, to, its, opposite, sufragio, efectivo, no, reelecci, n, effective, suffrage, no, re, election, d, az, had, the, constitution, amended, first, to, allow, two, terms, in, office, and, then, to, remove, all, restrictions, on, re, election, with, these, changes, in, place, d, az, was, re, elected, four, more, times, by, implausibly, high, margins, and, on, some, occasions, claimed, to, have, won, with, either, unanimous, or, near, unanimous, support, over, the, next, twenty, six, years, as, president, d, az, created, a, systematic, and, methodical, regime, with, a, staunch, military, mindset, his, first, goal, was, to, establish, peace, throughout, mexico, according, to, john, a, crow, d, az, set, out, to, establish, a, good, strong, paz, porfiriana, or, porfirian, peace, of, such, scope, and, firmness, that, it, would, redeem, the, country, in, the, eyes, of, the, world, for, its, sixty, five, years, of, revolution, and, anarchy, since, independence, his, second, goal, was, outlined, in, his, motto, little, of, politics, and, plenty, of, administration, meaning, the, replacement, of, open, political, conflict, by, a, well, functioning, government, apparatus, to, secure, his, power, d, az, engaged, in, various, forms, of, co, optation, and, coercion, he, constantly, balanced, between, the, private, desires, of, different, interest, groups, and, playing, off, one, interest, against, another, following, the, gonz, lez, presidency, d, az, abandoned, favoring, his, own, political, group, camarilla, that, brought, him, to, power, in, 1876, in, the, plan, of, tuxtepec, and, selected, ministers, and, other, high, officials, from, other, factions, those, included, those, loyal, to, ju, rez, mat, as, romero, and, lerdo, manuel, romero, rubio, manuel, dubl, n, was, one, of, the, few, loyalists, from, the, plan, of, tuxtepec, that, d, az, retained, as, a, cabinet, minister, as, money, flowed, to, the, mexican, treasury, from, foreign, investments, d, az, could, buy, off, his, loyalists, from, tuxtepec, an, important, group, supporting, the, regime, were, foreign, investors, especially, from, the, u, s, and, great, britain, as, well, as, germany, and, france, d, az, himself, met, with, investors, binding, him, with, this, group, in, a, personal, rather, than, institutional, fashion, the, close, cooperation, between, these, foreign, elements, and, the, d, az, regime, was, a, key, nationalist, issue, in, the, mexican, revolution, in, order, to, satisfy, any, competing, domestic, forces, such, as, mestizos, and, indigenous, leaders, d, az, gave, them, political, positions, or, made, them, intermediators, for, foreign, interests, he, acted, similarly, with, rural, elites, by, not, interfering, with, their, wealth, and, haciendas, the, urban, middle, classes, in, mexico, city, were, often, in, opposition, to, the, government, but, with, the, country, s, economic, prosperity, and, the, expansion, of, the, government, they, had, job, opportunities, in, federal, employment, covering, both, pro, and, anti, clerical, elements, d, az, was, both, the, head, of, the, freemasons, in, mexico, and, an, important, advisor, to, the, catholic, bishops, d, az, proved, to, be, a, different, kind, of, liberal, than, those, of, the, past, he, neither, assaulted, the, church, nor, protected, it, with, the, influx, of, foreign, investment, and, investors, protestant, missionaries, arrived, in, mexico, especially, in, mexico, s, north, and, protestants, became, an, opposition, force, during, the, mexican, revolution, although, there, was, factionalism, in, the, ruling, group, and, in, some, regions, d, az, suppressed, the, formation, of, opposition, parties, d, az, dissolved, all, local, authorities, and, all, aspects, of, federalism, that, once, existed, not, long, after, he, became, president, the, governors, of, all, federal, states, in, mexico, answered, directly, to, him, those, who, held, high, positions, of, power, such, as, members, of, the, legislature, were, almost, entirely, his, closest, and, most, loyal, friends, congress, was, a, rubber, stamp, for, his, policy, plans, and, they, were, compliant, in, amending, the, 1857, constitution, to, allow, his, re, election, and, extension, of, the, presidential, term, in, his, quest, for, political, control, d, az, suppressed, the, press, and, controlled, the, court, system, d, az, could, intervene, in, political, matters, that, threatened, political, stability, such, as, in, the, conflict, in, the, northern, mexican, state, of, coahuila, placing, jos, mar, a, garza, galan, in, the, governorship, undercutting, wealthy, estate, owner, evaristo, madero, grandfather, of, francisco, i, madero, who, would, challenge, d, az, in, the, 1910, election, in, another, case, d, az, placed, general, bernardo, reyes, in, the, governorship, of, the, state, of, nuevo, le, n, displacing, existing, political, elites, a, key, supporter, of, d, az, was, former, lerdista, manuel, romero, rubio, according, to, historian, friedrich, katz, romero, rubio, was, in, many, respects, the, architect, of, the, porfirian, state, the, relationship, between, the, two, was, cemented, when, d, az, married, romero, rubio, s, young, daughter, carmen, romero, rubio, and, his, supporters, did, not, oppose, the, amendment, to, the, constitution, to, allow, d, az, s, initial, re, election, and, then, indefinite, re, election, one, of, romero, rubio, s, prot, g, s, was, jos, yves, limantour, who, became, the, main, financial, adviser, to, the, regime, stabilizing, the, country, s, public, finances, limantour, s, political, network, was, dubbed, the, cient, ficos, the, scientists, for, their, approach, to, governance, they, sought, reforms, such, as, decreasing, corruption, and, increasing, uniform, application, of, laws, d, az, opposed, any, significant, reform, and, continued, to, appoint, governors, and, legislators, and, control, the, judiciary, d, az, had, not, trained, as, a, soldier, but, made, his, career, in, the, military, during, a, tumultuous, era, of, the, u, s, invasion, of, mexico, the, age, of, general, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, the, reform, war, and, the, second, french, intervention, a, study, of, his, presidential, cabinets, found, that, 83, of, cabinet, members, old, enough, had, fought, in, one, or, more, of, those, conflicts, the, tradition, of, post, independence, mexico, of, the, military, intervening, and, dominance, over, civilian, politicians, continued, under, d, az, a, closer, study, shows, that, over, time, prominent, military, figures, increasingly, played, a, much, smaller, role, in, his, government, civilian, politicians, loyal, to, him, rather, than, his, military, comrades, in, arms, came, to, dominate, his, cabinet, his, regime, was, not, a, military, dictatorship, but, rather, had, strong, civilian, allies, his, replacement, of, military, advisors, for, civilians, signaled, that, it, was, civilians, who, held, power, in, the, political, arena, in, office, d, az, was, able, to, bring, provincial, military, strongmen, under, the, control, of, the, central, government, a, process, that, took, fifteen, years, he, provided, opportunities, for, graft, for, military, men, he, could, not, successfully, confront, on, the, battlefield, ample, salaries, helped, maintain, the, loyalty, of, others, dangerous, military, leaders, could, be, sent, on, foreign, missions, to, study, military, training, in, europe, as, well, as, nonmilitary, issues, and, thereby, keep, them, out, of, mexico, officers, who, retired, could, receive, half, the, salary, of, their, highest, rank, he, created, military, zones, that, were, not, contiguous, with, state, boundaries, and, rotated, the, commanders, regularly, preventing, them, from, becoming, entrenched, in, any, one, zone, then, extended, the, practice, to, lower, ranking, officers, d, az, destroyed, provincial, militarism, and, developed, in, its, stead, a, national, army, that, sustained, the, central, government, a, potential, opposition, force, was, the, mexican, federal, army, troops, were, often, men, forced, into, military, service, and, poorly, paid, d, az, increased, the, size, of, the, military, budget, and, began, modernizing, the, institution, along, the, lines, of, european, militaries, including, the, establishment, in, 1897, of, separate, military, academies, to, train, army, and, naval, officers, high, rank, officers, were, brought, into, government, service, d, az, expanded, the, crack, police, force, the, rurales, who, were, under, the, control, of, the, president, d, az, knew, that, it, was, crucial, for, him, to, suppress, banditry, he, expanded, the, rurales, although, it, guarded, chiefly, only, transport, routes, to, major, cities, d, az, thus, worked, to, enhance, his, control, over, the, military, and, the, police, by, the, time, of, the, outbreak, of, the, mexican, revolution, in, 1910, the, federal, army, had, an, aging, leadership, and, disgruntled, troops, and, they, were, unable, to, control, the, revolutionary, forces, in, active, multiple, locations, unlike, other, mexican, liberals, d, az, was, not, anti, clerical, which, became, a, political, advantage, when, d, az, came, to, power, he, won, over, conservatives, including, the, catholic, church, as, an, institution, and, social, conservatives, supporting, it, radical, liberalism, was, anti, clerical, seeing, the, privileges, of, the, church, as, challenging, the, idea, of, equality, before, the, law, and, individual, rather, than, corporate, identity, they, considered, the, economic, power, of, the, catholic, church, a, detriment, to, modernization, and, development, the, church, as, a, major, corporate, landowner, and, de, facto, banking, institution, shaped, investments, to, conservative, landed, estates, more, than, industry, infrastructure, building, or, exports, in, power, after, the, ouster, of, santa, anna, liberals, implemented, legal, measures, to, curtail, the, power, of, the, church, the, ju, rez, law, abolished, special, privileges, fueros, of, ecclesiastics, and, the, military, and, the, lerdo, law, mandated, disentailment, of, the, property, of, corporations, specifically, the, church, and, indigenous, communities, the, liberal, constitution, of, 1857, removed, the, privileged, position, of, the, catholic, church, and, opened, the, way, to, religious, tolerance, considering, religious, expression, as, freedom, of, speech, catholic, priests, were, ineligible, for, elective, office, but, could, vote, conservatives, fought, back, in, the, reform, war, under, the, banner, of, religi, n, y, fueros, religion, and, privileges, but, were, defeated, in, 1861, following, the, fall, of, the, second, empire, in, 1867, liberal, presidents, benito, ju, rez, and, his, successor, sebasti, n, lerdo, de, tejada, began, implementing, the, anti, clerical, measures, of, the, constitution, lerdo, went, further, extending, the, laws, of, the, reform, to, formalize, the, separation, of, church, and, state, civil, marriage, as, the, only, valid, manner, for, state, recognition, prohibitions, of, religious, corporations, to, acquire, real, estate, elimination, of, religious, elements, from, legal, oaths, and, the, elimination, of, monastic, vows, as, legally, binding, further, prohibitions, on, the, church, in, 1874, included, the, exclusion, of, religion, in, public, institutions, restriction, of, religious, acts, to, church, precincts, banning, of, religious, garb, in, public, except, within, churches, and, prohibition, of, the, ringing, of, church, bells, except, to, summon, parishioners, d, az, was, a, political, pragmatist, seeing, that, the, religious, question, re, opened, political, discord, in, mexico, when, he, rebelled, against, lerdo, d, az, had, at, least, the, tacit, and, perhaps, even, the, explicit, support, of, the, catholic, church, when, he, came, to, power, in, 1877, d, az, left, the, anti, clerical, laws, in, place, but, no, longer, enforced, them, as, state, policy, leaving, that, to, individual, mexican, states, this, led, to, the, re, emergence, of, the, church, in, many, areas, but, in, others, a, less, full, role, the, church, flouted, the, reform, prohibitions, against, wearing, clerical, garb, there, were, open, air, processions, and, masses, and, religious, orders, existed, the, church, also, recovered, its, property, sometimes, through, intermediaries, and, tithes, were, again, collected, the, church, regained, its, role, in, education, with, the, complicity, of, the, d, az, regime, which, did, not, invest, in, public, education, the, church, also, regained, its, role, in, running, charitable, institutions, despite, the, increasingly, visible, role, of, the, catholic, church, during, the, porfiriato, the, vatican, was, unsuccessful, in, getting, the, reinstatement, of, a, formal, relationship, between, the, papacy, and, mexico, and, the, constitutional, limitations, of, the, church, as, an, institution, remained, as, law, this, modus, vivendi, between, d, az, and, the, church, had, pragmatic, and, positive, consequences, d, az, did, not, publicly, renounce, liberal, anti, clericalism, meaning, that, the, constitution, of, 1857, remained, in, place, but, he, did, not, enforce, its, anti, clerical, measures, conflict, could, reignite, but, it, was, to, the, advantage, of, both, the, church, and, the, d, az, government, for, this, arrangement, to, continue, if, the, church, did, counter, d, az, he, had, the, constitutional, means, to, rein, in, its, power, the, church, regained, considerable, economic, power, with, conservative, intermediaries, holding, lands, for, it, the, church, remained, important, in, education, and, charitable, institutions, other, important, symbols, of, the, normalization, of, religion, in, late, 19th, century, mexico, included, the, return, of, the, jesuits, expelled, by, the, bourbon, charles, iii, in, 1767, the, crowning, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, as, queen, of, mexico, and, the, support, of, mexican, bishops, for, d, az, s, work, as, peacemaker, when, the, mexican, revolution, broke, out, in, 1910, the, catholic, church, was, a, staunch, supporter, of, the, d, az, regime, d, az, sought, to, attract, foreign, investment, to, mexico, to, aid, the, development, of, mining, agriculture, industry, and, infrastructure, political, stability, and, the, revision, of, laws, some, dating, to, the, colonial, era, created, a, legal, structure, and, an, atmosphere, where, entrepreneurs, felt, secure, in, investing, capital, in, mexico, railways, financed, by, foreign, capital, transformed, areas, that, were, remote, from, markets, into, productive, regions, the, government, mandate, to, survey, land, meant, that, secure, title, was, established, for, investors, the, process, often, obliterated, claims, of, local, communities, that, could, not, prove, title, or, extinguished, traditional, usage, of, forests, and, other, areas, not, under, cultivation, the, private, survey, companies, bid, for, contracts, from, the, mexican, government, with, the, companies, acquiring, one, third, of, the, land, measured, often, prime, land, that, was, along, proposed, railway, routes, companies, usually, sold, that, land, often, to, foreigners, who, pursued, large, scale, cultivation, of, crops, for, export, crops, included, coffee, rubber, henequen, for, twine, used, in, binding, wheat, sugar, wheat, and, vegetable, production, land, only, suitable, for, pasturage, was, enclosed, with, barbed, wire, extinguishing, traditional, communal, grazing, of, cattle, and, premium, cattle, were, imported, owners, of, large, landed, estates, haciendas, often, took, the, opportunity, to, sell, to, foreign, investors, as, well, the, result, by, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, was, the, transfer, of, a, vast, amount, of, mexican, land, in, all, parts, of, the, country, into, foreign, hands, either, individuals, or, land, companies, along, the, northern, border, with, the, u, s, american, investors, were, prominent, but, they, owned, land, along, both, coasts, across, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, and, central, mexico, rural, communities, and, small, scale, farmers, lost, their, holdings, and, were, forced, to, be, agricultural, wage, laborers, or, pursue, or, move, conditions, on, haciendas, were, often, harsh, landlessness, caused, rural, discontent, and, a, major, cause, of, peasant, participation, in, the, mexican, revolution, seeking, a, reversal, of, the, concentration, of, land, ownership, through, land, reform, for, elites, it, was, the, golden, age, of, mexican, economics, 3, 2, dollars, per, peso, mexico, was, compared, economically, to, economic, powers, of, the, time, such, as, france, great, britain, and, germany, for, some, mexicans, there, was, no, money, and, the, doors, were, thrown, open, to, those, who, had, economic, progress, varied, drastically, from, region, to, region, the, north, was, defined, by, mining, and, ranching, while, the, central, valley, became, the, home, of, large, scale, farms, for, wheat, and, grain, and, large, industrial, centers, one, component, of, economic, growth, involved, stimulating, foreign, investment, in, the, mexican, mining, sector, through, tax, waivers, and, other, incentives, investment, and, growth, were, effectively, realized, the, secluded, southern, baja, california, region, benefited, from, the, establishment, of, an, economic, zone, with, the, founding, of, the, town, of, santa, rosal, a, and, the, prosperous, development, of, the, el, boleo, copper, mine, this, came, about, when, d, az, granted, a, french, mining, company, a, 70, year, tax, waiver, in, return, for, its, substantial, investment, in, the, project, in, a, similar, fashion, the, city, of, guanajuato, realized, substantial, foreign, investment, in, local, silver, mining, ventures, the, city, subsequently, experienced, a, period, of, prosperity, symbolized, by, the, construction, of, numerous, landmark, buildings, most, notably, the, magnificent, ju, rez, theatre, by, 1900, over, 90, of, the, communal, land, of, the, central, plateau, had, been, sold, off, or, expropriated, forcing, 9, 5, million, peasants, off, the, land, and, into, the, service, of, big, landowners, because, d, az, had, created, such, an, effective, centralized, government, he, was, able, to, concentrate, decision, making, and, maintain, control, over, the, economic, instability, this, instability, arose, largely, as, a, result, of, the, dispossession, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, peasants, of, their, land, communal, indigenous, landholdings, were, privatized, subdivided, and, sold, the, porfiriato, thus, generated, a, stark, contrast, between, rapid, economic, growth, and, sudden, severe, impoverishment, of, the, rural, masses, a, situation, that, was, to, explode, in, the, mexican, revolution, of, 1910, during, 1883, 1894, laws, were, passed, to, give, fewer, and, fewer, people, large, amounts, of, land, which, was, taken, away, from, people, by, bribing, local, judges, to, declare, it, vacant, or, unoccupied, terrenos, bald, os, a, friend, of, d, az, obtained, 12, million, acres, of, land, in, baja, california, by, bribing, local, judges, those, who, opposed, were, killed, or, captured, and, sold, as, slaves, to, plantations, the, manufacture, of, cheap, alcohol, increased, prompting, the, number, of, bars, in, mexico, city, to, rise, from, 51, in, 1864, to, 1, 400, in, 1900, this, caused, the, rate, of, death, from, alcoholism, and, alcohol, related, accidents, to, rise, to, levels, higher, than, anywhere, else, in, the, world, d, az, has, been, characterized, as, a, republican, monarch, and, his, regime, a, synthesis, of, pragmatic, bourbon, methods, and, liberal, republican, ideals, as, much, by, longevity, as, by, design, d, az, came, to, embody, the, nation, d, az, did, not, plan, well, for, the, transition, to, a, regime, other, than, his, own, as, d, az, aged, and, continued, to, be, re, elected, the, question, of, presidential, succession, became, more, urgent, political, aspirants, within, his, regime, envisioned, succeeding, to, the, presidency, and, opponents, began, organizing, in, anticipation, of, d, az, s, exit, in, 1898, the, d, az, regime, faced, a, number, of, important, issues, with, the, death, of, mat, as, romero, d, az, s, long, time, political, adviser, who, had, made, great, efforts, to, strengthen, mexico, s, ties, with, the, u, s, since, the, ju, rez, regime, and, a, major, shift, in, u, s, foreign, policy, toward, imperialism, with, its, success, in, the, spanish, american, war, romero, s, death, created, new, dynamics, amongst, the, three, political, groups, that, d, az, both, relied, upon, and, manipulated, romero, s, faction, had, strongly, supported, u, s, investment, in, mexico, and, was, largely, pro, american, but, with, romero, s, death, his, faction, declined, in, power, the, other, two, factions, were, jos, yves, limantour, s, cient, ficos, and, bernardo, reyes, s, followers, the, reyistas, limantour, pursued, a, policy, of, offsetting, u, s, influence, by, favoring, european, investment, especially, british, banking, houses, and, entrepreneurs, such, as, weetman, pearson, u, s, investment, in, mexico, remained, robust, even, grew, but, the, economic, climate, was, more, hostile, to, their, interests, and, their, support, for, the, regime, declined, the, u, s, had, asserted, that, it, had, the, preeminent, role, in, the, western, hemisphere, with, u, s, president, theodore, roosevelt, modifying, the, monroe, doctrine, via, the, roosevelt, corollary, which, declared, that, the, u, s, could, intervene, in, other, countries, political, affairs, if, the, u, s, determined, they, were, not, well, run, d, az, pushed, back, against, this, policy, saying, that, the, security, of, the, hemisphere, was, a, collective, enterprise, of, all, its, nations, there, was, a, meeting, of, american, states, in, the, second, pan, american, conference, which, met, in, mexico, city, from, 22, october, 1901, 31, january, 1902, and, the, u, s, backed, off, from, its, hard, line, policy, of, interventionism, at, least, for, the, moment, in, regard, to, mexico, in, domestic, politics, bernardo, reyes, became, increasingly, powerful, and, d, az, appointed, him, minister, of, war, the, mexican, federal, army, was, becoming, increasingly, ineffective, with, wars, being, waged, against, the, yaqui, in, northwest, mexico, and, the, maya, reyes, requested, and, received, increased, funding, to, augment, the, number, of, men, at, arms, there, was, some, open, opposition, to, d, az, s, regime, with, eccentric, lawyer, nicol, s, z, iga, y, miranda, running, against, d, az, z, iga, lost, every, election, but, always, claimed, fraud, and, considered, himself, to, be, the, legitimately, elected, president, but, he, did, not, mount, a, serious, challenge, to, the, regime, more, importantly, as, the, 1910, election, approached, and, d, az, stated, he, would, not, run, for, re, election, limantour, and, reyes, vied, against, each, other, for, favor, on, 17, february, 1908, in, an, interview, with, the, u, s, journalist, james, creelman, of, pearson, s, magazine, d, az, stated, that, mexico, was, ready, for, democracy, and, elections, and, that, he, would, retire, and, allow, other, candidates, to, compete, for, the, presidency, without, hesitation, several, opposition, and, pro, government, groups, united, to, find, suitable, candidates, who, would, represent, them, in, the, upcoming, presidential, elections, many, liberals, formed, clubs, supporting, bernardo, reyes, then, the, governor, of, nuevo, le, n, as, a, candidate, despite, the, fact, that, reyes, never, formally, announced, his, candidacy, d, az, continued, to, perceive, him, as, a, threat, and, sent, him, on, a, mission, to, europe, so, that, he, was, not, in, the, country, for, the, elections, in, 1909, d, az, and, william, howard, taft, the, then, president, of, the, united, states, planned, a, summit, in, el, paso, texas, and, ciudad, ju, rez, chihuahua, mexico, a, historic, first, meeting, between, a, u, s, president, and, a, mexican, president, and, also, the, first, time, an, american, president, would, cross, the, border, into, mexico, d, az, requested, the, meeting, to, show, u, s, support, for, his, planned, seventh, run, as, president, and, taft, agreed, to, protect, the, several, billion, dollars, of, american, capital, then, invested, in, mexico, after, nearly, 30, years, with, d, az, in, power, u, s, businesses, controlled, nearly, 90, percent, of, mexico, s, mineral, resources, its, national, railroad, its, oil, industry, and, increasingly, its, land, both, sides, agreed, that, the, disputed, chamizal, strip, connecting, el, paso, to, ciudad, ju, rez, would, be, considered, neutral, territory, with, no, flags, present, during, the, summit, but, the, meeting, focused, attention, on, this, territory, and, resulted, in, assassination, threats, and, other, serious, security, concerns, the, texas, rangers, 4, 000, u, s, and, mexican, troops, u, s, secret, service, agents, fbi, agents, and, u, s, marshals, were, all, called, in, to, provide, security, an, additional, 250, man, private, security, detail, led, by, frederick, russell, burnham, the, celebrated, scout, was, hired, by, john, hays, hammond, a, close, friend, of, taft, from, yale, and, a, former, candidate, for, u, s, vice, president, in, 1908, who, along, with, his, business, partner, burnham, held, considerable, mining, interests, in, mexico, on, 16, october, the, day, of, the, summit, burnham, and, private, c, r, moore, a, texas, ranger, discovered, a, man, holding, a, concealed, palm, pistol, standing, at, the, el, paso, chamber, of, commerce, building, along, the, procession, route, burnham, and, moore, captured, and, disarmed, the, assassin, within, only, a, few, feet, of, d, az, and, taft, the, year, 1910, was, important, in, mexico, s, history, the, centennial, of, the, revolt, by, miguel, hidalgo, seen, as, the, beginning, of, the, mexican, war, of, independence, on, the, cover, of, the, official, program, for, the, centennial, three, figures, are, shown, hidalgo, father, of, independence, benito, ju, rez, with, the, label, lex, law, and, porfirio, d, az, with, the, label, pax, peace, also, on, the, cover, are, the, emblem, of, mexico, and, the, cap, of, liberty, d, az, inaugurated, the, monument, to, independence, with, its, golden, angel, during, the, september, centennial, celebrations, although, d, az, and, ju, rez, had, been, political, rivals, after, the, french, intervention, d, az, had, done, much, to, promote, the, legacy, of, his, dead, rival, and, had, a, large, monument, to, ju, rez, built, by, the, alameda, park, which, d, az, inaugurated, during, the, centennial, a, work, published, in, 1910, details, the, day, by, day, events, of, the, september, festivities, as, groups, began, to, settle, on, their, presidential, candidate, d, az, decided, that, he, was, not, going, to, retire, but, rather, allow, francisco, i, madero, an, elite, but, democratically, leaning, reformer, to, run, against, him, although, madero, a, landowner, was, very, similar, to, d, az, in, his, ideology, he, hoped, for, other, elites, in, mexico, to, rule, alongside, the, president, ultimately, however, d, az, did, not, approve, of, madero, and, had, him, jailed, during, the, 1910, election, the, election, went, ahead, madero, had, gathered, much, popular, support, but, when, the, government, announced, the, official, results, d, az, was, proclaimed, to, have, been, re, elected, almost, unanimously, with, madero, said, to, have, attained, a, minuscule, number, of, votes, this, case, of, massive, electoral, fraud, aroused, widespread, anger, throughout, the, mexican, citizenry, madero, called, for, revolt, against, d, az, in, the, plan, of, san, luis, potos, and, the, violence, to, oust, d, az, is, now, seen, as, the, first, phase, of, the, mexican, revolution, rebellions, in, many, different, places, stretched, the, federal, army, s, and, the, rurales, s, ability, to, suppress, them, all, revealing, the, regime, s, weakness, d, az, was, forced, to, resign, from, office, on, 25, may, 1911, and, left, the, country, for, spain, six, days, later, on, 31, may, 1911, d, az, kept, his, brother, s, son, f, lix, d, az, away, from, political, or, military, power, he, did, however, allow, his, nephew, to, enrich, himself, it, was, only, after, d, az, went, into, exile, in, 1911, that, his, nephew, became, prominent, in, politics, as, the, embodiment, of, the, old, regime, even, so, d, az, s, assessment, of, his, nephew, proved, astute, since, f, lix, never, successfully, led, troops, or, garnered, sustained, support, and, was, forced, into, exile, several, times, on, 2, july, 1915, d, az, died, in, exile, in, paris, france, he, was, buried, in, the, cimeti, re, du, montparnasse, his, other, children, died, as, infants, or, young, children, his, widow, carmen, and, his, son, were, allowed, to, return, to, mexico, d, az, came, from, a, devoutly, catholic, family, his, relative, jos, agust, n, dom, nguez, y, diaz, was, bishop, of, oaxaca, d, az, had, trained, for, the, priesthood, and, it, seemed, likely, that, was, his, career, path, oaxaca, was, a, centre, of, liberalism, and, the, founding, of, the, institute, of, arts, and, sciences, a, secular, institution, helped, foster, professional, training, for, oaxacan, liberals, including, benito, ju, rez, and, porfirio, d, az, when, d, az, abandoned, his, ecclesiastical, career, for, one, in, the, military, his, powerful, uncle, disowned, him, in, d, az, s, personal, life, it, is, clear, that, religion, still, mattered, and, that, fierce, anti, clericalism, could, have, a, high, price, in, 1870, his, brother, f, lix, a, fellow, liberal, who, was, then, governor, of, oaxaca, had, rigorously, applied, the, anti, clerical, laws, of, the, reform, in, the, rebellious, and, supposedly, idolatrous, town, of, juchit, n, in, tehuantepec, f, lix, d, az, had, roped, the, image, of, the, patron, saint, of, juchit, n, to, his, horse, and, dragged, it, away, returning, the, saint, days, later, with, its, feet, cut, off, when, f, lix, had, to, flee, oaxaca, city, in, 1871, following, porfirio, s, failed, coup, against, ju, rez, f, lix, ended, up, in, juchit, n, where, the, villagers, killed, him, doing, to, his, body, even, worse, than, he, did, to, their, saint, having, lost, a, brother, to, the, fury, of, religious, peasants, d, az, had, a, cautionary, tale, about, the, dangers, of, enforcing, anti, clericalism, even, so, it, is, clear, that, d, az, wanted, to, remain, in, good, standing, with, the, church, d, az, married, his, niece, delfina, ortega, d, az, 1845, 1880, the, daughter, of, his, sister, manuela, josefa, d, az, mori, 1824, 1856, d, az, and, she, would, have, seven, children, with, delfina, dying, due, to, complications, of, her, seventh, delivery, following, her, death, he, wrote, a, private, letter, to, church, officials, renouncing, the, laws, of, the, reform, which, allowed, his, wife, to, be, buried, with, catholic, rites, in, sacred, ground, d, az, had, a, relationship, with, a, soldadera, rafaela, qui, ones, during, the, war, of, the, french, intervention, which, resulted, in, the, birth, of, amada, d, az, 1867, 1962, whom, he, recognized, amada, went, to, live, in, d, az, s, home, with, his, wife, delfina, amada, married, ignacio, de, la, torre, y, mier, but, the, couple, had, no, children, de, la, torre, was, said, to, have, been, present, at, the, 1901, dance, of, the, forty, one, a, gathering, of, gay, men, and, cross, dressers, that, was, raided, by, police, the, report, that, de, la, torre, was, there, was, neither, confirmed, nor, denied, but, the, dance, was, a, huge, scandal, at, the, time, satirized, by, caricaturist, jos, guadalupe, posada, d, az, remarried, in, 1881, to, carmen, romero, rubio, the, pious, 17, year, old, daughter, of, his, most, important, advisor, manuel, romero, rubio, oaxaca, cleric, father, eulogio, gillow, y, zavala, gave, his, blessing, gillow, was, later, appointed, archbishop, of, oaxaca, do, a, carmen, is, credited, with, bringing, d, az, into, closer, reconciliation, with, the, church, but, d, az, was, already, inclined, in, that, direction, the, marriage, produced, no, children, but, d, az, s, surviving, children, lived, with, the, couple, until, adulthood, in, 1938, the, 430, piece, collection, of, arms, of, the, late, general, porfirio, d, az, was, donated, to, the, royal, military, college, of, canada, in, kingston, ontario, although, d, az, is, criticized, on, many, grounds, he, did, not, create, a, family, dynasty, his, only, son, to, survive, to, adulthood, porfirio, d, az, ortega, known, as, porfirito, trained, to, be, an, officer, at, the, military, academy, he, graduated, as, a, military, engineer, and, never, served, in, combat, he, and, his, family, went, into, european, exile, after, d, az, s, resignation, they, were, allowed, to, return, to, mexico, during, the, amnesty, of, l, zaro, c, rdenas, the, legacy, of, d, az, has, undergone, revision, since, the, 1990s, in, d, az, s, lifetime, before, his, ouster, there, was, an, adulatory, literature, which, has, been, named, porfirismo, he, maintained, an, international, reputation, as, the, statesman, that, had, finally, brought, stability, to, mexico, leo, tolstoy, referred, to, him, as, a, prodigy, of, nature, elihu, root, proclaimed, him, a, hero, who, deserved, the, praise, of, mankind, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, gifted, a, portrait, of, himself, to, d, az, and, referred, to, him, as, a, benefit, for, the, continent, the, vast, literature, that, characterizes, him, as, a, tyrant, and, dictator, has, its, origins, in, the, late, period, of, d, az, s, rule, and, has, continued, to, shape, d, az, s, historical, image, in, recent, years, however, there, has, been, an, effort, to, rehabilitate, d, az, s, figure, most, prominently, by, television, personality, and, historian, enrique, krauze, in, what, has, been, termed, neo, porfirismo, as, mexico, pursued, a, neoliberal, path, under, president, carlos, salinas, de, gortari, the, policies, of, d, az, that, opened, mexico, up, to, foreign, investment, fit, with, the, turn, of, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, toward, privatization, of, state, companies, and, market, oriented, reforms, d, az, was, characterized, as, a, far, more, benign, figure, for, these, revisionists, d, az, is, usually, credited, with, the, saying, pobre, m, xico, tan, lejos, de, dios, y, tan, cerca, de, los, estados, unidos, poor, mexico, so, far, from, god, and, so, close, to, the, united, states, partly, due, to, d, az, s, lengthy, tenure, the, current, mexican, constitution, limits, a, president, to, a, single, six, year, term, with, no, possibility, of, re, election, even, if, it, is, nonconsecutive, additionally, no, one, who, holds, the, post, even, on, a, caretaker, basis, is, allowed, to, run, or, serve, again, this, provision, is, so, entrenched, that, it, remained, in, place, even, after, legislators, were, allowed, to, run, for, a, second, consecutive, term, there, have, been, several, attempts, to, return, d, az, s, remains, to, mexico, since, the, 1920s, the, most, recent, movement, started, in, 2014, in, oaxaca, by, the, comisi, n, especial, de, los, festejos, del, centenario, luctuoso, de, porfirio, d, az, mori, which, is, headed, by, francisco, jim, nez, according, to, some, the, fact, that, d, az, s, remains, have, not, been, returned, to, mexico, symbolises, the, failure, of, the, post, revolutionary, state, to, come, to, terms, with, the, legacy, of, the, d, az, regime, list, of, notable, foreign, awards, awarded, to, president, d, az
