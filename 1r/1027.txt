persian, revolt, invasion, of, anatolia, invasion, of, babylonia, cyrus, ii, of, persia, old, persian, k, ru, c, 600, 530, bc, commonly, known, as, cyrus, the, great, was, the, founder, of, the, achaemenid, empire, hailing, from, persis, he, brought, the, achaemenid, dynasty, to, power, by, defeating, the, median, empire, and, embracing, all, of, the, previous, civilized, states, of, the, ancient, near, east, expanding, vastly, and, eventually, conquering, most, of, west, asia, and, much, of, central, asia, to, create, what, would, soon, become, the, largest, polity, in, human, history, at, the, time, the, achaemenid, empire, s, largest, territorial, extent, was, achieved, under, darius, the, great, whose, rule, stretched, from, the, balkans, eastern, bulgaria, paeonia, and, thrace, macedonia, and, the, rest, of, southeast, europe, in, the, west, to, the, indus, valley, in, the, east, after, conquering, the, median, empire, cyrus, led, the, achaemenids, to, conquer, lydia, and, eventually, the, neo, babylonian, empire, he, also, led, an, expedition, into, central, asia, which, resulted, in, major, military, campaigns, that, were, described, as, having, brought, into, subjection, every, nation, without, exception, cyrus, allegedly, died, in, battle, with, the, massagetae, a, nomadic, eastern, iranian, tribal, confederation, along, the, syr, darya, in, december, 530, bc, however, xenophon, of, athens, claimed, that, cyrus, did, not, die, fighting, and, had, instead, returned, to, the, city, of, pasargadae, which, served, as, the, achaemenid, ceremonial, capital, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, cambyses, ii, whose, campaigns, into, north, africa, led, to, the, conquests, of, egypt, nubia, and, cyrenaica, during, his, short, rule, to, the, greeks, he, was, known, as, cyrus, the, elder, greek, k, ros, ho, presb, teros, cyrus, was, particularly, renowned, among, contemporary, scholars, because, of, his, habitual, policy, of, respecting, peoples, customs, and, religions, in, the, lands, that, he, conquered, he, was, influential, in, developing, the, system, of, a, central, administration, at, pasargadae, to, govern, the, achaemenid, empire, s, satraps, which, worked, for, the, profit, of, both, rulers, and, subjects, following, the, persian, conquest, of, babylon, cyrus, issued, the, edict, of, restoration, in, which, he, authorized, and, encouraged, the, return, of, the, jewish, people, to, what, had, been, the, kingdom, of, judah, officially, ending, the, babylonian, captivity, he, is, mentioned, in, the, hebrew, bible, and, left, a, lasting, legacy, on, judaism, due, to, his, role, in, facilitating, the, return, to, zion, a, migratory, event, in, which, the, jews, returned, to, the, land, of, israel, following, cyrus, establishment, of, yehud, medinata, and, subsequently, rebuilt, the, temple, in, jerusalem, which, had, been, destroyed, by, the, babylonian, siege, of, jerusalem, according, to, chapter, 45, 1, of, the, book, of, isaiah, cyrus, was, anointed, by, yahweh, for, this, task, as, a, biblical, messiah, he, is, the, only, non, jewish, figure, to, be, revered, in, this, capacity, in, addition, to, his, influence, on, the, traditions, of, both, the, eastern, world, and, the, western, world, cyrus, is, also, recognized, for, his, achievements, in, human, rights, politics, and, military, strategy, the, achaemenid, empire, s, prestige, in, the, ancient, world, would, eventually, extend, as, far, west, as, athens, where, upper, class, greeks, adopted, aspects, of, the, culture, of, the, ruling, persian, class, as, their, own, as, the, founder, of, the, first, persian, empire, cyrus, played, a, crucial, role, in, defining, the, national, identity, of, the, iranian, nation, the, achaemenid, empire, was, instrumental, in, spreading, the, ideals, of, zoroastrianism, as, far, east, as, china, he, remains, a, cult, figure, in, iran, with, the, tomb, of, cyrus, at, pasargadae, serving, as, a, spot, of, reverence, for, millions, of, the, country, s, citizens, the, name, cyrus, is, a, latinized, form, derived, from, the, greek, language, name, k, ros, which, itself, was, derived, from, the, old, persian, name, k, ru, the, name, and, its, meaning, have, been, recorded, within, ancient, inscriptions, in, different, languages, the, ancient, greek, historians, ctesias, and, plutarch, stated, that, cyrus, was, named, from, the, sun, kuros, a, concept, which, has, been, interpreted, as, meaning, like, the, sun, khurvash, by, noting, its, relation, to, the, persian, noun, for, sun, khor, while, using, vash, as, a, suffix, of, likeness, karl, hoffmann, has, suggested, a, translation, based, on, the, meaning, of, an, indo, european, root, to, humiliate, and, accordingly, the, name, cyrus, means, humiliator, of, the, enemy, in, verbal, contest, another, possible, iranian, derivation, would, mean, the, young, one, child, similar, to, kurdish, kur, son, little, boy, or, ossetian, i, gur, un, to, be, born, and, kur, young, bull, in, the, persian, language, and, especially, in, iran, cyrus, name, is, spelled, as, k, ro, in, the, bible, he, is, referred, to, in, the, hebrew, language, as, koresh, some, pieces, of, evidence, suggest, that, cyrus, is, kay, khosrow, a, legendary, persian, king, of, the, kayanian, dynasty, and, a, character, in, shahnameh, a, persian, epic, some, scholars, however, believe, that, neither, cyrus, nor, cambyses, were, iranian, names, proposing, that, cyrus, was, elamite, in, origin, and, that, the, name, meant, he, who, bestows, care, in, the, extinct, elamite, language, one, reason, is, that, while, elamite, names, may, end, in, u, no, elamite, texts, spell, the, name, this, way, only, kura, meanwhile, old, persian, did, not, allow, names, to, end, in, a, so, it, would, make, sense, for, persian, speakers, to, change, an, original, kura, into, the, more, grammatically, correct, form, kuru, elamite, scribes, on, the, other, hand, would, not, have, had, a, reason, to, change, an, original, kura, into, kuru, since, both, forms, were, acceptable, therefore, kura, probably, represents, the, original, form, another, scholarly, opinion, is, that, kuru, was, a, name, of, indo, aryan, origin, in, honour, of, the, indo, aryan, kuru, and, kamboja, mercenaries, from, eastern, afghanistan, and, northwest, india, that, helped, in, the, conquest, of, the, middle, east, the, persian, domination, and, kingdom, in, the, iranian, plateau, started, as, an, extension, of, the, achaemenid, dynasty, who, expanded, their, earlier, dominion, possibly, from, the, 9th, century, bc, onward, the, eponymous, founder, of, the, dynasty, was, achaemenes, from, old, persian, hax, mani, achaemenids, are, descendants, of, achaemenes, as, darius, the, great, the, ninth, king, of, the, dynasty, traced, his, ancestry, to, him, declaring, for, this, reason, we, are, called, achaemenids, achaemenes, built, the, state, of, parsumash, in, the, southwest, of, iran, and, was, succeeded, by, teispes, who, took, the, title, king, of, anshan, after, seizing, the, city, anshan, and, enlarging, his, kingdom, further, to, include, pars, proper, ancient, documents, mention, that, teispes, had, a, son, called, cyrus, i, who, also, succeeded, his, father, as, king, of, anshan, cyrus, i, had, a, full, brother, whose, name, is, recorded, as, ariaramnes, in, 600, bc, cyrus, i, was, succeeded, by, his, son, cambyses, i, who, reigned, until, 559, bc, cyrus, ii, the, great, was, a, son, of, cambyses, i, who, had, named, his, son, after, his, father, cyrus, i, there, are, several, inscriptions, of, cyrus, the, great, and, later, kings, that, refer, to, cambyses, i, as, the, great, king, and, king, of, anshan, among, these, are, some, passages, in, the, cyrus, cylinder, where, cyrus, calls, himself, son, of, cambyses, great, king, king, of, anshan, another, inscription, from, cm, s, mentions, cambyses, i, as, a, mighty, king, and, an, achaemenian, which, according, to, the, bulk, of, scholarly, opinion, was, engraved, under, darius, and, considered, as, a, later, forgery, by, darius, however, cambyses, ii, s, maternal, grandfather, pharnaspes, is, named, by, historian, herodotus, as, an, achaemenian, xenophon, s, account, in, his, cyrop, dia, names, cambyses, s, wife, as, mandane, and, mentions, cambyses, as, king, of, iran, ancient, persia, these, agree, with, cyrus, s, own, inscriptions, as, anshan, and, parsa, were, different, names, for, the, same, land, these, also, agree, with, other, non, iranian, accounts, except, on, one, point, from, herodotus, which, states, that, cambyses, was, not, a, king, but, a, persian, of, good, family, however, in, some, other, passages, herodotus, account, is, wrong, also, on, the, name, of, the, son, of, chishpish, which, he, mentions, as, cambyses, but, according, to, modern, scholars, should, be, cyrus, i, the, traditional, view, based, on, archaeological, research, and, the, genealogy, given, in, the, behistun, inscription, and, by, herodotus, holds, that, cyrus, the, great, was, an, achaemenid, however, m, waters, has, suggested, that, cyrus, is, unrelated, to, the, achaemenids, or, darius, the, great, and, that, his, family, was, of, teispid, and, anshanite, origin, instead, of, achaemenid, cyrus, was, born, to, cambyses, i, king, of, anshan, and, mandane, daughter, of, astyages, king, of, media, during, the, period, of, 600, 599, bc, by, his, own, account, generally, believed, now, to, be, accurate, cyrus, was, preceded, as, king, by, his, father, cambyses, i, grandfather, cyrus, i, and, great, grandfather, teispes, cyrus, married, cassandane, who, was, an, achaemenian, and, the, daughter, of, pharnaspes, who, bore, him, two, sons, cambyses, ii, and, bardiya, along, with, three, daughters, atossa, artystone, and, roxane, cyrus, and, cassandane, were, known, to, love, each, other, very, much, cassandane, said, that, she, found, it, more, bitter, to, leave, cyrus, than, to, depart, her, life, after, her, death, cyrus, insisted, on, public, mourning, throughout, the, kingdom, the, nabonidus, chronicle, states, that, babylonia, mourned, cassandane, for, six, days, identified, as, 21, 26, march, 538, bc, after, his, father, s, death, cyrus, inherited, the, persian, throne, at, pasargadae, which, was, a, vassal, of, astyages, the, greek, historian, strabo, has, said, that, cyrus, was, originally, named, agradates, by, his, step, parents, it, is, possible, that, when, reuniting, with, his, original, family, following, the, naming, customs, cyrus, s, father, cambyses, i, named, him, cyrus, after, his, grandfather, who, was, cyrus, i, there, is, also, an, account, by, strabo, that, claimed, agradates, adopted, the, name, cyrus, after, the, cyrus, river, near, pasargadae, herodotus, gave, a, mythological, account, of, cyrus, s, early, life, in, this, account, astyages, had, two, prophetic, dreams, in, which, a, flood, and, then, a, series, of, fruit, bearing, vines, emerged, from, his, daughter, mandane, s, pelvis, and, covered, the, entire, kingdom, these, were, interpreted, by, his, advisers, as, a, foretelling, that, his, grandson, would, one, day, rebel, and, supplant, him, as, king, astyages, summoned, mandane, at, the, time, pregnant, with, cyrus, back, to, ecbatana, to, have, the, child, killed, his, general, harpagus, delegated, the, task, to, mithradates, one, of, the, shepherds, of, astyages, who, raised, the, child, and, passed, off, his, stillborn, son, to, harpagus, as, the, dead, infant, cyrus, cyrus, lived, in, secrecy, but, when, he, reached, the, age, of, 10, during, a, childhood, game, he, had, the, son, of, a, nobleman, beaten, when, he, refused, to, obey, cyrus, commands, as, it, was, unheard, of, for, the, son, of, a, shepherd, to, commit, such, an, act, astyages, had, the, boy, brought, to, his, court, and, interviewed, him, and, his, adoptive, father, upon, the, shepherd, s, confession, astyages, sent, cyrus, back, to, persia, to, live, with, his, biological, parents, however, astyages, summoned, the, son, of, harpagus, and, in, retribution, chopped, him, to, pieces, roasted, some, portions, while, boiling, others, and, tricked, his, adviser, into, eating, his, child, during, a, large, banquet, following, the, meal, astyages, s, servants, brought, harpagus, the, head, hands, and, feet, of, his, son, on, platters, so, he, could, realize, his, inadvertent, cannibalism, cyrus, the, great, succeeded, to, the, throne, in, 559, bc, following, his, father, s, death, however, cyrus, was, not, yet, an, independent, ruler, like, his, predecessors, cyrus, had, to, recognize, median, overlordship, astyages, last, king, of, the, median, empire, and, cyrus, s, grandfather, may, have, ruled, over, the, majority, of, the, ancient, near, east, from, the, lydian, frontier, in, the, west, to, the, lands, of, the, parthians, and, persians, in, the, east, according, to, the, nabonidus, chronicle, astyages, launched, an, attack, against, cyrus, king, of, ansan, according, to, the, historian, herodotus, it, is, known, that, astyages, placed, harpagus, in, command, of, the, median, army, to, conquer, cyrus, however, harpagus, contacted, cyrus, and, encouraged, his, revolt, against, media, before, eventually, defecting, along, with, several, of, the, nobility, and, a, portion, of, the, army, this, mutiny, is, confirmed, by, the, nabonidus, chronicle, the, chronicle, suggests, that, the, hostilities, lasted, for, at, least, three, years, 553, 550, bc, and, the, final, battle, resulted, in, the, capture, of, ecbatana, this, was, described, in, the, paragraph, that, preceded, the, entry, for, nabonidus, s, year, 7, which, detailed, cyrus, s, victory, and, the, capture, of, his, grandfather, according, to, the, historians, herodotus, and, ctesias, cyrus, spared, the, life, of, astyages, and, married, his, daughter, amytis, this, marriage, pacified, several, vassals, including, the, bactrians, parthians, and, saka, herodotus, notes, that, cyrus, also, subdued, and, incorporated, sogdia, into, the, empire, during, his, military, campaigns, of, 546, 539, bc, with, astyages, out, of, power, all, of, his, vassals, including, many, of, cyrus, s, relatives, were, now, under, his, command, his, uncle, arsames, who, had, been, the, king, of, the, city, state, of, parsa, under, the, medes, therefore, would, have, had, to, give, up, his, throne, however, this, transfer, of, power, within, the, family, seems, to, have, been, smooth, and, it, is, likely, that, arsames, was, still, the, nominal, governor, of, parsa, under, cyrus, s, authority, more, a, prince, or, a, grand, duke, than, a, king, his, son, hystaspes, who, was, also, cyrus, s, second, cousin, was, then, made, satrap, of, parthia, and, phrygia, cyrus, the, great, thus, united, the, twin, achaemenid, kingdoms, of, parsa, and, anshan, into, persia, proper, arsames, lived, to, see, his, grandson, become, darius, the, great, shahanshah, of, persia, after, the, deaths, of, both, of, cyrus, s, sons, cyrus, s, conquest, of, media, was, merely, the, start, of, his, wars, the, exact, dates, of, the, lydian, conquest, are, unknown, but, it, must, have, taken, place, between, cyrus, s, overthrow, of, the, median, kingdom, 550, bc, and, his, conquest, of, babylon, 539, bc, it, was, common, in, the, past, to, give, 547, bc, as, the, year, of, the, conquest, due, to, some, interpretations, of, the, nabonidus, chronicle, but, this, position, is, currently, not, much, held, the, lydians, first, attacked, the, achaemenid, empire, s, city, of, pteria, in, cappadocia, the, king, of, lydia, croesus, besieged, and, captured, the, city, enslaving, its, inhabitants, meanwhile, the, persians, invited, the, citizens, of, ionia, who, were, part, of, the, lydian, kingdom, to, revolt, against, their, ruler, the, offer, was, rebuffed, and, thus, cyrus, levied, an, army, and, marched, against, the, lydians, increasing, his, numbers, while, passing, through, nations, in, his, way, the, battle, of, pteria, was, effectively, a, stalemate, with, both, sides, suffering, heavy, casualties, by, nightfall, croesus, retreated, to, sardis, the, following, morning, while, in, sardis, croesus, sent, out, requests, for, his, allies, to, send, aid, to, lydia, however, near, the, end, of, the, winter, before, the, allies, could, unite, cyrus, the, great, pushed, the, war, into, lydian, territory, and, besieged, croesus, in, his, capital, sardis, shortly, before, the, final, battle, of, thymbra, between, the, two, rulers, harpagus, advised, cyrus, the, great, to, place, his, dromedaries, in, front, of, his, warriors, the, lydian, horses, not, used, to, the, dromedaries, smell, would, be, very, afraid, the, strategy, worked, the, lydian, cavalry, was, routed, cyrus, defeated, and, captured, croesus, cyrus, occupied, the, capital, at, sardis, conquering, the, lydian, kingdom, in, 546, bc, according, to, herodotus, cyrus, the, great, spared, croesus, s, life, and, kept, him, as, an, advisor, but, this, account, conflicts, with, some, translations, of, the, contemporary, nabonidus, chronicle, which, interpret, that, the, king, of, lydia, was, slain, before, returning, to, the, capital, commagene, was, incorporated, into, persia, in, 546, bc, later, a, lydian, named, pactyas, was, entrusted, by, cyrus, the, great, to, send, croesus, s, treasury, to, persia, however, soon, after, cyrus, s, departure, pactyas, hired, mercenaries, and, caused, an, uprising, in, sardis, revolting, against, the, persian, satrap, of, lydia, tabalus, cyrus, sent, mazares, one, of, his, commanders, to, subdue, the, insurrection, but, demanded, that, pactyas, be, returned, alive, upon, mazares, s, arrival, pactyas, fled, to, ionia, where, he, had, hired, more, mercenaries, mazares, marched, his, troops, into, the, greek, country, and, subdued, the, cities, of, magnesia, and, priene, the, fate, of, pactyas, is, unknown, but, after, capture, he, was, probably, sent, to, cyrus, and, put, to, death, after, being, tortured, mazares, continued, the, conquest, of, asia, minor, but, died, of, unknown, causes, during, his, campaign, in, ionia, cyrus, sent, harpagus, to, complete, mazares, s, conquest, of, asia, minor, harpagus, captured, lycia, aeolia, and, caria, using, the, technique, of, building, earthworks, to, breach, the, walls, of, besieged, cities, a, method, unknown, to, the, greeks, he, ended, his, conquest, of, the, area, in, 542, bc, and, returned, to, persia, after, the, conquest, of, lydia, cyrus, campaigned, in, the, east, between, around, 545, bc, to, 540, bc, cyrus, first, tried, to, conquer, gedrosia, however, he, was, decisively, defeated, and, departed, gedrosia, gedrosia, was, most, likely, conquered, during, the, reign, of, darius, i, after, the, failed, attempt, to, conquer, gedrosia, cyrus, attacked, the, regions, of, bactria, arachosia, sogdia, saka, chorasmia, margiana, and, other, provinces, in, the, east, in, 533, bc, cyrus, the, great, crossed, the, hindu, kush, mountains, and, collected, tribute, from, the, indus, cities, thus, cyrus, probably, had, established, vassal, states, in, western, india, cyrus, then, returned, with, his, army, to, babylon, due, to, the, unrest, taking, place, in, and, around, babylon, by, the, year, 540, bc, cyrus, captured, elam, and, its, capital, susa, the, nabonidus, chronicle, records, that, prior, to, the, battle, s, the, king, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, nabonidus, had, ordered, cult, statues, from, outlying, babylonian, cities, to, be, brought, into, the, capital, suggesting, that, the, conflict, had, begun, possibly, in, the, winter, of, 540, bc, just, before, october, 539, bc, cyrus, fought, the, battle, of, opis, in, or, near, the, strategic, riverside, city, of, opis, on, the, tigris, north, of, babylon, the, babylonian, army, was, routed, and, on, 10, october, sippar, was, seized, without, a, battle, with, little, to, no, resistance, from, the, populace, it, is, probable, that, cyrus, engaged, in, negotiations, with, the, babylonian, generals, to, obtain, a, compromise, on, their, part, and, therefore, avoid, an, armed, confrontation, nabonidus, who, had, retreated, to, sippar, following, his, defeat, at, opis, fled, to, borsippa, around, 12, october, persian, general, gubaru, s, troops, entered, babylon, again, without, any, resistance, from, the, babylonian, armies, and, detained, nabonidus, herodotus, explains, that, to, accomplish, this, feat, the, persians, using, a, basin, dug, earlier, by, the, babylonian, queen, nitokris, to, protect, babylon, against, median, attacks, diverted, the, euphrates, river, into, a, canal, so, that, the, water, level, dropped, to, the, height, of, the, middle, of, a, man, s, thigh, which, allowed, the, invading, forces, to, march, directly, through, the, river, bed, to, enter, at, night, shortly, thereafter, nabonidus, returned, from, borsippa, and, surrendered, to, cyrus, on, 29, october, cyrus, entered, the, city, of, babylon, prior, to, cyrus, s, invasion, of, babylon, the, neo, babylonian, empire, had, conquered, many, kingdoms, in, addition, to, babylonia, cyrus, probably, incorporated, its, sub, national, entities, into, his, empire, including, syria, judea, and, arabia, petraea, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, to, support, this, assumption, after, taking, babylon, cyrus, the, great, proclaimed, himself, king, of, babylon, king, of, sumer, and, akkad, king, of, the, four, corners, of, the, world, in, the, famous, cyrus, cylinder, an, inscription, on, a, cylinder, that, was, deposited, in, the, foundations, of, the, esagila, temple, dedicated, to, the, chief, babylonian, god, marduk, the, text, of, the, cylinder, denounces, nabonidus, as, impious, and, portrays, the, victorious, cyrus, as, pleasing, the, god, marduk, it, describes, how, cyrus, had, improved, the, lives, of, the, citizens, of, babylonia, repatriated, displaced, peoples, and, restored, temples, and, cult, sanctuaries, although, some, have, asserted, that, the, cylinder, represents, a, form, of, human, rights, charter, historians, generally, portray, it, in, the, context, of, a, long, standing, mesopotamian, tradition, of, new, rulers, beginning, their, reigns, with, declarations, of, reforms, cyrus, the, great, s, dominions, composed, the, largest, empire, the, world, had, ever, seen, to, that, point, at, the, end, of, cyrus, s, rule, the, achaemenid, empire, stretched, from, asia, minor, in, the, west, to, the, indus, river, in, the, east, the, details, of, cyrus, s, death, vary, by, account, ctesias, in, his, persica, has, the, longest, account, which, says, cyrus, met, his, death, while, putting, down, resistance, from, the, derbices, infantry, aided, by, other, scythian, archers, and, cavalry, plus, indians, and, their, war, elephants, according, to, him, this, event, took, place, northeast, of, the, headwaters, of, the, syr, darya, the, account, of, herodotus, from, his, histories, provides, the, second, longest, detail, in, which, cyrus, met, his, fate, in, a, fierce, battle, with, the, massagetae, a, scythian, tribal, confederation, from, the, southern, deserts, of, khwarezm, and, kyzyl, kum, in, the, southernmost, portion, of, the, eurasian, steppe, regions, of, modern, day, kazakhstan, and, uzbekistan, following, the, advice, of, croesus, to, attack, them, in, their, own, territory, the, massagetae, were, related, to, the, scythians, in, their, dress, and, mode, of, living, they, fought, on, horseback, and, on, foot, in, order, to, acquire, her, realm, cyrus, first, sent, an, offer, of, marriage, to, their, ruler, the, empress, tomyris, a, proposal, she, rejected, he, then, commenced, his, attempt, to, take, massagetae, territory, by, force, c, 529, bc, beginning, by, building, bridges, and, towered, war, boats, along, his, side, of, the, river, oxus, or, amu, darya, which, separated, them, sending, him, a, warning, to, cease, his, encroachment, a, warning, which, she, stated, she, expected, he, would, disregard, anyway, tomyris, challenged, him, to, meet, her, forces, in, honorable, warfare, inviting, him, to, a, location, in, her, country, a, day, s, march, from, the, river, where, their, two, armies, would, formally, engage, each, other, he, accepted, her, offer, but, learning, that, the, massagetae, were, unfamiliar, with, wine, and, its, intoxicating, effects, he, set, up, and, then, left, camp, with, plenty, of, it, behind, taking, his, best, soldiers, with, him, and, leaving, the, least, capable, ones, the, general, of, tomyris, s, army, spargapises, who, was, also, her, son, and, a, third, of, the, massagetian, troops, killed, the, group, cyrus, had, left, there, and, finding, the, camp, well, stocked, with, food, and, the, wine, unwittingly, drank, themselves, into, inebriation, diminishing, their, capability, to, defend, themselves, when, they, were, then, overtaken, by, a, surprise, attack, they, were, successfully, defeated, and, although, he, was, taken, prisoner, spargapises, committed, suicide, once, he, regained, sobriety, upon, learning, of, what, had, transpired, tomyris, denounced, cyrus, s, tactics, as, underhanded, and, swore, vengeance, leading, a, second, wave, of, troops, into, battle, herself, cyrus, the, great, was, ultimately, killed, and, his, forces, suffered, massive, casualties, in, what, herodotus, referred, to, as, the, fiercest, battle, of, his, career, and, the, ancient, world, when, it, was, over, tomyris, ordered, the, body, of, cyrus, brought, to, her, then, decapitated, him, and, dipped, his, head, in, a, vessel, of, blood, in, a, symbolic, gesture, of, revenge, for, his, bloodlust, and, the, death, of, her, son, however, some, scholars, question, this, version, mostly, because, even, herodotus, admits, this, event, was, one, of, many, versions, of, cyrus, s, death, that, he, heard, from, a, supposedly, reliable, source, who, told, him, no, one, was, there, to, see, the, aftermath, herodotus, also, recounts, that, cyrus, saw, in, his, sleep, the, oldest, son, of, hystaspes, darius, i, with, wings, upon, his, shoulders, shadowing, with, the, one, wing, asia, and, with, the, other, wing, europe, archaeologist, sir, max, mallowan, explains, this, statement, by, herodotus, and, its, connection, with, the, four, winged, bas, relief, figure, of, cyrus, the, great, in, the, following, way, herodotus, therefore, as, i, surmise, may, have, known, of, the, close, connection, between, this, type, of, winged, figure, and, the, image, of, iranian, majesty, which, he, associated, with, a, dream, prognosticating, the, king, s, death, before, his, last, fatal, campaign, across, the, oxus, muhammad, dandamayev, says, that, persians, may, have, taken, cyrus, s, body, back, from, the, massagetae, unlike, what, herodotus, claimed, according, to, the, chronicle, of, michael, the, syrian, ad, 1166, 1199, cyrus, was, killed, by, his, wife, tomyris, queen, of, the, massagetae, maksata, in, the, 60th, year, of, jewish, captivity, an, alternative, account, from, xenophon, s, cyropaedia, contradicts, the, others, claiming, that, cyrus, died, peacefully, at, his, capital, the, final, version, of, cyrus, s, death, comes, from, berossus, who, only, reports, that, cyrus, met, his, death, while, warring, against, the, dahae, archers, northwest, of, the, headwaters, of, the, syr, darya, cyrus, the, great, s, remains, may, have, been, interred, in, his, capital, city, of, pasargadae, where, today, a, limestone, tomb, built, around, 540, 530, bc, still, exists, which, many, believe, to, be, his, strabo, and, arrian, give, nearly, identical, descriptions, of, the, tomb, based, on, the, eyewitness, report, of, aristobulus, of, cassandreia, who, at, the, request, of, alexander, the, great, visited, the, tomb, twice, though, the, city, itself, is, now, in, ruins, the, burial, place, of, cyrus, the, great, has, remained, largely, intact, and, the, tomb, has, been, partially, restored, to, counter, its, natural, deterioration, over, the, centuries, according, to, plutarch, his, epitaph, read, o, man, whoever, you, are, and, wherever, you, come, from, for, i, know, you, will, come, i, am, cyrus, who, won, the, persians, their, empire, do, not, therefore, begrudge, me, this, bit, of, earth, that, covers, my, bones, cuneiform, evidence, from, babylon, proves, that, cyrus, died, around, december, 530, bc, and, that, his, son, cambyses, ii, had, become, king, cambyses, continued, his, father, s, policy, of, expansion, and, captured, egypt, for, the, empire, but, soon, died, after, only, seven, years, of, rule, he, was, succeeded, either, by, cyrus, s, other, son, bardiya, or, an, impostor, posing, as, bardiya, who, became, the, sole, ruler, of, persia, for, seven, months, until, he, was, killed, by, darius, the, great, the, translated, ancient, roman, and, greek, accounts, give, a, vivid, description, of, the, tomb, both, geometrically, and, aesthetically, the, tomb, s, geometric, shape, has, changed, little, over, the, years, still, maintaining, a, large, stone, of, quadrangular, form, at, the, base, followed, by, a, pyramidal, succession, of, smaller, rectangular, stones, until, after, a, few, slabs, the, structure, is, curtailed, by, an, edifice, with, an, arched, roof, composed, of, a, pyramidal, shaped, stone, and, a, small, opening, or, window, on, the, side, where, the, slenderest, man, could, barely, squeeze, through, within, this, edifice, was, a, golden, coffin, resting, on, a, table, with, golden, supports, inside, of, which, the, body, of, cyrus, the, great, was, interred, upon, his, resting, place, was, a, covering, of, tapestry, and, drapes, made, from, the, best, available, babylonian, materials, utilizing, fine, median, worksmanship, below, his, bed, was, a, fine, red, carpet, covering, the, narrow, rectangular, area, of, his, tomb, translated, greek, accounts, describe, the, tomb, as, having, been, placed, in, the, fertile, pasargadae, gardens, surrounded, by, trees, and, ornamental, shrubs, with, a, group, of, achaemenian, protectors, called, the, magi, stationed, nearby, to, protect, the, edifice, from, theft, or, damage, years, later, in, the, chaos, created, by, alexander, the, great, s, invasion, of, persia, and, after, the, defeat, of, darius, iii, cyrus, the, great, s, tomb, was, broken, into, and, most, of, its, luxuries, were, looted, when, alexander, reached, the, tomb, he, was, horrified, by, the, manner, in, which, the, tomb, was, treated, and, questioned, the, magi, and, put, them, to, court, on, some, accounts, alexander, s, decision, to, put, the, magi, on, trial, was, more, about, his, attempt, to, undermine, their, influence, and, his, show, of, power, in, his, newly, conquered, empire, than, a, concern, for, cyrus, s, tomb, however, alexander, admired, cyrus, from, an, early, age, reading, xenophon, s, cyropaedia, which, described, cyrus, s, heroism, in, battle, and, governance, as, a, king, and, legislator, regardless, alexander, the, great, ordered, aristobulus, to, improve, the, tomb, s, condition, and, restore, its, interior, despite, his, admiration, for, cyrus, the, great, and, his, attempts, at, renovation, of, his, tomb, alexander, had, six, years, previously, 330, bc, sacked, persepolis, the, opulent, city, that, cyrus, may, have, chosen, the, site, for, and, either, ordered, its, burning, as, an, act, of, pro, greek, propaganda, or, set, it, on, fire, during, drunken, revels, the, edifice, has, survived, the, test, of, time, through, invasions, internal, divisions, successive, empires, regime, changes, and, revolutions, the, last, prominent, persian, figure, to, bring, attention, to, the, tomb, was, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, shah, of, iran, the, last, official, monarch, of, persia, during, his, celebrations, of, 2, 500, years, of, monarchy, just, as, alexander, the, great, before, him, the, shah, of, iran, wanted, to, appeal, to, cyrus, s, legacy, to, legitimize, his, own, rule, by, extension, the, united, nations, recognizes, the, tomb, of, cyrus, the, great, and, pasargadae, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, british, historian, charles, freeman, suggests, that, in, scope, and, extent, his, achievements, ranked, far, above, that, of, the, macedonian, king, alexander, who, was, to, demolish, the, empire, in, the, 320s, but, fail, to, provide, any, stable, alternative, cyrus, has, been, a, personal, hero, to, many, people, including, thomas, jefferson, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, and, david, ben, gurion, the, achievements, of, cyrus, the, great, throughout, antiquity, are, reflected, in, the, way, he, is, remembered, today, his, own, nation, the, iranians, have, regarded, him, as, the, father, the, very, title, that, had, been, used, during, the, time, of, cyrus, himself, by, the, many, nations, that, he, conquered, as, according, to, xenophon, and, those, who, were, subject, to, him, he, treated, with, esteem, and, regard, as, if, they, were, his, own, children, while, his, subjects, themselves, respected, cyrus, as, their, father, what, other, man, but, cyrus, after, having, overturned, an, empire, ever, died, with, the, title, of, the, father, from, the, people, whom, he, had, brought, under, his, power, for, it, is, plain, fact, that, this, is, a, name, for, one, that, bestows, rather, than, for, one, that, takes, away, the, babylonians, regarded, him, as, the, liberator, as, they, were, offended, by, their, previous, ruler, nabonidus, for, committing, sacrilege, the, book, of, ezra, narrates, a, story, of, the, first, return, of, exiles, in, the, first, year, of, cyrus, in, which, cyrus, proclaims, all, the, kingdoms, of, the, earth, hath, the, lord, the, god, of, heaven, given, me, and, he, hath, charged, me, to, build, him, a, house, in, jerusalem, which, is, in, judah, ezra, 1, 2, cyrus, was, distinguished, equally, as, a, statesman, and, as, a, soldier, due, in, part, to, the, political, infrastructure, he, created, the, achaemenid, empire, endured, long, after, his, death, the, rise, of, persia, under, cyrus, s, rule, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, course, of, world, history, including, in, forms, of, iranian, philosophy, literature, and, religion, many, of, the, iranian, dynasties, following, the, achaemenid, empire, and, their, kings, saw, themselves, as, the, heirs, to, cyrus, the, great, and, have, claimed, to, continue, the, line, begun, by, cyrus, however, there, are, different, opinions, among, scholars, whether, this, is, also, the, case, for, the, sassanid, dynasty, alexander, the, great, was, himself, infatuated, with, and, admired, cyrus, the, great, from, an, early, age, reading, xenophon, s, cyropaedia, which, described, cyrus, s, heroism, in, battle, and, governance, and, his, abilities, as, a, king, and, a, legislator, during, his, visit, to, pasargadae, he, ordered, aristobulus, to, decorate, the, interior, of, the, sepulchral, chamber, of, cyrus, s, tomb, cyrus, s, legacy, has, been, felt, even, as, far, away, as, iceland, and, colonial, america, many, of, the, thinkers, and, rulers, of, classical, antiquity, as, well, as, the, renaissance, and, enlightenment, era, and, the, forefathers, of, the, united, states, of, america, sought, inspiration, from, cyrus, the, great, through, works, such, as, cyropaedia, thomas, jefferson, for, example, owned, two, copies, of, cyropaedia, one, with, parallel, greek, and, latin, translations, on, facing, pages, showing, substantial, jefferson, markings, that, signify, the, amount, of, influence, the, book, has, had, on, drafting, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, according, to, professor, richard, nelson, frye, cyrus, whose, abilities, as, conqueror, and, administrator, frye, says, are, attested, by, the, longevity, and, vigor, of, the, achaemenid, empire, held, an, almost, mythic, role, among, the, persian, people, similar, to, that, of, romulus, and, remus, in, rome, or, moses, for, the, israelites, with, a, story, that, follows, in, many, details, the, stories, of, hero, and, conquerors, from, elsewhere, in, the, ancient, world, frye, writes, he, became, the, epitome, of, the, great, qualities, expected, of, a, ruler, in, antiquity, and, he, assumed, heroic, features, as, a, conqueror, who, was, tolerant, and, magnanimous, as, well, as, brave, and, daring, his, personality, as, seen, by, the, greeks, influenced, them, and, alexander, the, great, and, as, the, tradition, was, transmitted, by, the, romans, may, be, considered, to, influence, our, thinking, even, now, his, rule, was, studied, and, admired, by, many, of, the, great, leaders, such, as, alexander, the, great, julius, caesar, and, thomas, jefferson, pierre, briant, wrote, that, given, the, poor, information, we, have, it, seems, quite, reckless, to, try, to, reconstruct, what, the, religion, of, cyrus, might, have, been, it, is, also, debated, whether, he, was, a, practitioner, of, zoroastrianism, or, whether, zoroastrianism, only, becomes, involved, with, the, imperial, religion, of, the, achaemenid, empire, after, him, the, evidence, in, favor, of, it, comes, from, some, of, the, names, of, members, of, cyrus, family, and, similarities, between, the, description, of, cyrus, in, isaiah, 40, 48, and, the, gathas, against, the, thesis, is, how, cyrus, treated, local, polytheistic, cults, acknowledging, their, gods, and, providing, funding, for, the, establishment, of, their, temples, and, other, holy, sites, as, well, as, a, possible, late, date, for, the, activity, of, the, iranian, prophet, zoroaster, who, founded, zoroastrianism, the, policies, of, cyrus, with, respect, to, treatment, of, minority, religions, are, documented, in, many, historical, accounts, particularly, babylonian, texts, and, jewish, sources, cyrus, had, a, general, policy, of, religious, tolerance, throughout, his, vast, empire, whether, this, was, a, new, policy, or, the, continuation, of, policies, followed, by, the, babylonians, and, assyrians, as, lester, grabbe, maintains, is, disputed, he, brought, peace, to, the, babylonians, and, is, said, to, have, kept, his, army, away, from, the, temples, and, restored, the, statues, of, the, babylonian, gods, to, their, sanctuaries, information, about, religion, and, ritual, during, the, reign, of, cyrus, is, also, available, from, the, cyropaedia, of, xenophon, the, histories, of, herodotus, and, inscriptions, though, these, were, written, in, later, periods, and, so, must, be, used, carefully, the, cyrus, cylinder, was, composed, in, the, name, of, cyrus, with, him, as, the, first, person, speaker, the, cylinder, is, highly, religious, and, is, framed, around, the, interventions, of, the, god, marduk, it, is, marduk, who, is, praised, in, the, outset, of, the, text, whose, direct, intervention, is, thought, to, be, responsible, for, what, happened, in, recent, history, and, it, is, marduk, who, summons, cyrus, for, the, purpose, of, righting, the, wrongs, of, his, predecessor, nabonidus, furthermore, cyrus, offers, respect, not, only, to, the, cult, of, marduk, but, also, to, local, cults, one, inscription, from, uruk, states, cyrus, loves, esangil, and, ezida, while, another, from, ur, mentons, that, he, returned, the, gods, to, their, shrines, another, from, babylon, or, sippar, says, that, unlike, nabonidus, cyrus, provided, proper, and, even, increased, the, sacrifices, for, the, gods, additional, reliable, information, may, come, from, the, funerary, customs, around, the, tomb, of, cyrus, which, indicates, a, privileged, cult, honoring, mithra, some, have, also, identified, the, figure, depicted, in, the, bas, relief, from, pasargadae, as, mithra, further, indicating, the, reverence, of, cyrus, for, this, deity, additional, evidence, further, indicates, the, connection, between, cyrus, and, mithra, the, treatment, of, the, jews, by, cyrus, during, their, exile, in, babylon, after, nebuchadnezzar, ii, destroyed, jerusalem, is, reported, in, the, bible, cyrus, is, represented, positively, and, as, an, agent, of, yahweh, even, though, he, is, said, to, not, know, yahweh, isaiah, 45, 4, 5, the, jewish, bible, s, ketuvim, ends, in, second, chronicles, with, the, decree, of, cyrus, which, returned, the, exiles, to, the, promised, land, from, babylon, along, with, a, commission, to, rebuild, the, temple, thus, saith, cyrus, king, of, persia, all, the, kingdoms, of, the, earth, hath, the, l, ord, the, god, of, heaven, given, me, and, he, hath, charged, me, to, build, him, a, house, in, jerusalem, which, is, in, judah, whosoever, there, is, among, you, of, all, his, people, the, l, ord, his, god, be, with, him, let, him, go, there, 2, chronicles, 36, 23, this, edict, is, also, fully, reproduced, in, the, book, of, ezra, in, the, first, year, of, king, cyrus, cyrus, the, king, issued, a, decree, concerning, the, house, of, god, at, jerusalem, let, the, temple, the, place, where, sacrifices, are, offered, be, rebuilt, and, let, its, foundations, be, retained, its, height, being, 60, cubits, and, its, width, 60, cubits, with, three, layers, of, huge, stones, and, one, layer, of, timbers, and, let, the, cost, be, paid, from, the, royal, treasury, also, let, the, gold, and, silver, utensils, of, the, house, of, god, which, nebuchadnezzar, took, from, the, temple, in, jerusalem, and, brought, to, babylon, be, returned, and, brought, to, their, places, in, the, temple, in, jerusalem, and, you, shall, put, them, in, the, house, of, god, ezra, 6, 3, 5, the, jews, honored, him, as, a, dignified, and, righteous, king, in, one, biblical, passage, isaiah, refers, to, him, as, messiah, lit, his, anointed, one, isaiah, 45, 1, making, him, the, only, gentile, to, be, so, referred, elsewhere, in, isaiah, god, is, described, as, saying, i, will, raise, up, cyrus, in, my, righteousness, i, will, make, all, his, ways, straight, he, will, rebuild, my, city, and, set, my, exiles, free, but, not, for, a, price, or, reward, says, god, almighty, isaiah, 45, 13, as, the, text, suggests, cyrus, did, ultimately, release, the, nation, of, israel, from, its, exile, without, compensation, or, tribute, these, particular, passages, isaiah, 40, 55, often, referred, to, as, deutero, isaiah, are, believed, by, most, modern, critical, scholars, to, have, been, added, by, another, author, toward, the, end, of, the, babylonian, exile, c, 536, bc, josephus, the, first, century, jewish, historian, relates, the, traditional, view, of, the, jews, regarding, the, prediction, of, cyrus, in, isaiah, in, his, antiquities, of, the, jews, book, 11, chapter, 1, in, the, first, year, of, the, reign, of, cyrus, which, was, the, seventieth, from, the, day, that, our, people, were, removed, out, of, their, own, land, into, babylon, god, commiserated, the, captivity, and, calamity, of, these, poor, people, according, as, he, had, foretold, to, them, by, jeremiah, the, prophet, before, the, destruction, of, the, city, that, after, they, had, served, nebuchadnezzar, and, his, posterity, and, after, they, had, undergone, that, servitude, seventy, years, he, would, restore, them, again, to, the, land, of, their, fathers, and, they, should, build, their, temple, and, enjoy, their, ancient, prosperity, and, these, things, god, did, afford, them, for, he, stirred, up, the, mind, of, cyrus, and, made, him, write, this, throughout, all, asia, thus, saith, cyrus, the, king, since, god, almighty, hath, appointed, me, to, be, king, of, the, habitable, earth, i, believe, that, he, is, that, god, which, the, nation, of, the, israelites, worship, for, indeed, he, foretold, my, name, by, the, prophets, and, that, i, should, build, him, a, house, at, jerusalem, in, the, country, of, judea, this, was, known, to, cyrus, by, his, reading, the, book, which, isaiah, left, behind, him, of, his, prophecies, for, this, prophet, said, that, god, had, spoken, thus, to, him, in, a, secret, vision, my, will, is, that, cyrus, whom, i, have, appointed, to, be, king, over, many, and, great, nations, send, back, my, people, to, their, own, land, and, build, my, temple, this, was, foretold, by, isaiah, one, hundred, and, forty, years, before, the, temple, was, demolished, accordingly, when, cyrus, read, this, and, admired, the, divine, power, an, earnest, desire, and, ambition, seized, upon, him, to, fulfill, what, was, so, written, so, he, called, for, the, most, eminent, jews, that, were, in, babylon, and, said, to, them, that, he, gave, them, leave, to, go, back, to, their, own, country, and, to, rebuild, their, city, jerusalem, and, the, temple, of, god, for, that, he, would, be, their, assistant, and, that, he, would, write, to, the, rulers, and, governors, that, were, in, the, neighborhood, of, their, country, of, judea, that, they, should, contribute, to, them, gold, and, silver, for, the, building, of, the, temple, and, besides, that, beasts, for, their, sacrifices, while, cyrus, is, praised, in, the, tanakh, isaiah, 45, 1, 6, and, ezra, 1, 1, 11, there, was, jewish, criticism, of, him, after, he, was, lied, to, by, the, cuthites, who, wanted, to, halt, the, building, of, the, second, temple, they, accused, the, jews, of, conspiring, to, rebel, so, cyrus, in, turn, stopped, the, construction, which, would, not, be, completed, until, 515, bc, during, the, reign, of, darius, i, according, to, the, bible, it, was, king, artaxerxes, who, was, convinced, to, stop, the, construction, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, ezra, 4, 7, 24, the, historical, nature, of, this, decree, has, been, challenged, professor, lester, l, grabbe, argues, that, there, was, no, decree, but, that, there, was, a, policy, that, allowed, exiles, to, return, to, their, homelands, and, rebuild, their, temples, he, also, argues, that, the, archaeology, suggests, that, the, return, was, a, trickle, taking, place, over, perhaps, decades, resulting, in, a, maximum, population, of, perhaps, 30, 000, philip, r, davies, called, the, authenticity, of, the, decree, dubious, citing, grabbe, and, adding, that, arguing, against, the, authenticity, of, ezra, 1, 1, 4, is, j, briend, in, a, paper, given, at, the, institut, catholique, de, paris, on, 15, december, 1993, who, denies, that, it, resembles, the, form, of, an, official, document, but, reflects, rather, biblical, prophetic, idiom, mary, joan, winn, leith, believes, that, the, decree, in, ezra, might, be, authentic, and, along, with, the, cylinder, that, cyrus, like, earlier, rulers, was, through, these, decrees, trying, to, gain, support, from, those, who, might, be, strategically, important, particularly, those, close, to, egypt, which, he, wished, to, conquer, she, also, wrote, that, appeals, to, marduk, in, the, cylinder, and, to, yahweh, in, the, biblical, decree, demonstrate, the, persian, tendency, to, co, opt, local, religious, and, political, traditions, in, the, interest, of, imperial, control, some, modern, muslims, have, suggested, that, the, quranic, figure, of, dhu, al, qarnayn, is, a, representation, of, cyrus, the, great, but, the, scholarly, consensus, is, that, he, is, a, development, of, legends, concerning, alexander, the, great, cyrus, founded, the, empire, as, a, multi, state, empire, governed, by, four, capital, states, pasargadae, babylon, susa, and, ecbatana, he, allowed, a, certain, amount, of, regional, autonomy, in, each, state, in, the, form, of, a, satrapy, system, a, satrapy, was, an, administrative, unit, usually, organized, on, a, geographical, basis, a, satrap, governor, was, the, vassal, king, who, administered, the, region, a, general, supervised, military, recruitment, and, ensured, order, and, a, state, secretary, kept, the, official, records, the, general, and, the, state, secretary, reported, directly, to, the, satrap, as, well, as, the, central, government, during, his, reign, cyrus, maintained, control, over, a, vast, region, of, conquered, kingdoms, achieved, through, retaining, and, expanding, the, satrapies, further, organization, of, newly, conquered, territories, into, provinces, ruled, by, satraps, was, continued, by, cyrus, s, successor, darius, the, great, cyrus, s, empire, was, based, on, tribute, and, conscripts, from, the, many, parts, of, his, realm, through, his, military, savvy, cyrus, created, an, organized, army, including, the, immortals, unit, consisting, of, 10, 000, highly, trained, soldiers, he, also, formed, an, innovative, postal, system, throughout, the, empire, based, on, several, relay, stations, called, chapar, khaneh, cyrus, s, conquests, began, a, new, era, in, the, age, of, empire, building, where, a, vast, superstate, comprising, many, dozens, of, countries, races, religions, and, languages, were, ruled, under, a, single, administration, headed, by, a, central, government, this, system, lasted, for, centuries, and, was, retained, both, by, the, invading, seleucid, dynasty, during, their, control, of, persia, and, later, iranian, dynasties, including, the, parthians, and, sasanians, cyrus, has, been, known, for, his, innovations, in, building, projects, he, further, developed, the, technologies, that, he, found, in, the, conquered, cultures, and, applied, them, in, building, the, palaces, of, pasargadae, he, was, also, famous, for, his, love, of, gardens, the, recent, excavations, in, his, capital, city, has, revealed, the, existence, of, the, pasargadae, persian, garden, and, a, network, of, irrigation, canals, pasargadae, was, a, place, for, two, magnificent, palaces, surrounded, by, a, majestic, royal, park, and, vast, formal, gardens, among, them, was, the, four, quartered, wall, gardens, of, paradisia, with, over, 1000, meters, of, channels, made, out, of, carved, limestone, designed, to, fill, small, basins, at, every, 16, meters, and, water, various, types, of, wild, and, domestic, flora, the, design, and, concept, of, paradisia, were, exceptional, and, have, been, used, as, a, model, for, many, ancient, and, modern, parks, ever, since, the, english, physician, and, philosopher, sir, thomas, browne, penned, a, discourse, entitled, the, garden, of, cyrus, in, 1658, in, which, cyrus, is, depicted, as, an, archetypal, wise, ruler, while, the, protectorate, of, cromwell, ruled, britain, however, despite, being, featured, in, the, title, cyrus, was, not, a, main, focus, of, browne, s, work, cyrus, the, elder, brought, up, in, woods, and, mountains, when, time, and, power, enabled, pursued, the, dictate, of, his, education, and, brought, the, treasures, of, the, field, into, rule, and, circum, scription, so, nobly, beautifying, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, that, he, was, also, thought, to, be, the, authour, thereof, cyrus, s, standard, described, as, a, golden, eagle, mounted, upon, a, lofty, shaft, remained, the, official, banner, of, the, achaemenids, one, of, the, few, surviving, sources, of, information, that, can, be, dated, directly, to, cyrus, s, time, is, the, cyrus, cylinder, persian, a, document, in, the, form, of, a, clay, cylinder, inscribed, in, akkadian, cuneiform, it, had, been, placed, in, the, foundations, of, the, esagila, the, temple, of, marduk, in, babylon, as, a, foundation, deposit, following, the, persian, conquest, in, 539, bc, it, was, discovered, in, 1879, and, is, kept, today, in, the, british, museum, in, london, the, text, of, the, cylinder, denounces, the, deposed, babylonian, king, nabonidus, as, impious, and, portrays, cyrus, as, pleasing, to, the, chief, god, marduk, it, describes, how, cyrus, had, improved, the, lives, of, the, citizens, of, babylonia, repatriated, displaced, peoples, and, restored, temples, and, cult, sanctuaries, although, not, mentioned, specifically, in, the, text, the, repatriation, of, the, jews, from, their, babylonian, captivity, has, been, interpreted, as, part, of, this, general, policy, in, the, 1970s, the, shah, of, iran, adopted, the, cyrus, cylinder, as, a, political, symbol, using, it, as, a, central, image, in, his, celebration, of, 2500, years, of, iranian, monarchy, and, asserting, that, it, was, the, first, human, rights, charter, in, history, this, view, has, been, disputed, by, some, as, rather, anachronistic, and, tendentious, as, the, modern, concept, of, human, rights, would, have, been, quite, alien, to, cyrus, s, contemporaries, and, is, not, mentioned, by, the, cylinder, the, cylinder, has, nonetheless, become, seen, as, part, of, iran, s, cultural, identity, the, united, nations, has, declared, the, relic, to, be, an, ancient, declaration, of, human, rights, since, 1971, approved, by, then, secretary, general, sithu, u, thant, after, he, was, given, a, replica, by, the, sister, of, the, shah, of, iran, the, british, museum, describes, the, cylinder, as, an, instrument, of, ancient, mesopotamian, propaganda, that, reflects, a, long, tradition, in, mesopotamia, where, from, as, early, as, the, third, millennium, bc, kings, began, their, reigns, with, declarations, of, reforms, the, cylinder, emphasizes, cyrus, s, continuity, with, previous, babylonian, rulers, asserting, his, virtue, as, a, traditional, babylonian, king, while, denigrating, his, predecessor, neil, macgregor, director, of, the, british, museum, has, stated, that, the, cylinder, was, the, first, attempt, we, know, about, running, a, society, a, state, with, different, nationalities, and, faiths, a, new, kind, of, statecraft, he, explained, that, it, has, even, been, described, as, the, first, declaration, of, human, rights, and, while, this, was, never, the, intention, of, the, document, the, modern, concept, of, human, rights, scarcely, existed, in, the, ancient, world, it, has, come, to, embody, the, hopes, and, aspirations, of, many, the, use, of, the, name, kuru, as, a, currency, denomination, for, coinage, goes, back, to, the, 6th, century, bc, dating, to, the, time, of, the, croeseid, the, world, s, first, gold, coin, originally, minted, by, king, croesus, of, lydia, the, croeseid, was, later, continued, to, be, minted, and, spread, in, a, wide, geographical, area, by, cyrus, the, great, old, persian, k, ru, the, founder, of, the, achaemenid, empire, who, defeated, king, croesus, and, conquered, lydia, with, the, battle, of, thymbra, in, 547, bc, cyrus, k, ru, made, the, croeseid, the, standard, gold, coin, of, his, vast, empire, using, the, same, lion, and, bull, design, but, with, a, reduced, weight, 8, 06, grams, instead, of, the, standard, 10, 7, grams, of, the, original, version, issued, by, king, croesus, due, to, the, need, for, larger, amounts, of, these, coins, for, a, much, larger, population, his, regal, titles, in, full, were, the, great, king, king, of, persia, king, of, anshan, king, of, media, king, of, babylon, king, of, sumer, and, akkad, and, king, of, the, four, corners, of, the, world, the, nabonidus, chronicle, notes, the, change, in, his, title, from, king, of, anshan, to, king, of, persia, assyriologist, fran, ois, vallat, wrote, that, when, astyages, marched, against, cyrus, cyrus, is, called, king, of, anshan, but, when, cyrus, crosses, the, tigris, on, his, way, to, lydia, he, is, king, of, persia, the, coup, therefore, took, place, between, these, two, events
